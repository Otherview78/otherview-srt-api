1
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:20,933
Ow! Oh!

2
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,977
Stop, stop, stop.

3
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,648
Stop. Stop.

4
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,775
No, Krypto. Krypto.

5
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,777
Ow!

6
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,740
Krypto.

7
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,535
Take me home.

8
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,665
Home.

9
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:58,553
Krypto.

10
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,806
Home.

11
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,225
Superman!

12
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,867
Thank you.

13
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,287
No need to thank us, sir, as
we will not appreciate it.

14
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,581
We have no consciousness
whatsoever.

15
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,584
Merely automatons,
here to serve.

16
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,170
Meet Twelve. She's new.

17
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,964
-Hi.
-He looked at me.

18
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,885
I put your parents'
message on to soothe you.

19
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:20,968
Thank you.

20
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,013
He finds it soothing.

21
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,995
The message was damaged in
transit from Krypton to Earth.

22
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,288
But what is there…

23
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,459
"We love you more
than heaven, our son."

24
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:54,837
"We love you more than land."

25
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,422
"We love you more than land."

26
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,132
"Our beloved home will
soon be gone forever."

27
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,426
But hope vitalizes our hearts,

28
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,830
and that hope is you, Kal-El."

29
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,558
"We have searched the
universe for a home"

30
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,726
where you can do the most good

31
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,521
and live out Krypton's truth.

32
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,566
-That place is Earth."
-"That place is Earth."

33
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,235
And the rest of the
message is lost.

34
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,945
Fourteen fractured bones.

35
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,448
Damage to bladder, kidney,
large intestine, lungs.

36
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,868
Our poor Superman.

37
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,828
With a healthy
dose of yellow sun,

38
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,163
we'll have him up and
at 'em in no time.

39
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,106
Engineer, come in.

40
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,275
He landed somewhere near here.

41
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,610
I can't see where.

42
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,737
Well, keep looking.

43
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,080
Golly.

44
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:18,086
Sir, you are only 83% restored
to health. You must rest.

45
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,339
No can do, Four. I gotta
get back to the fray.

46
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:23,967
But this Hammer fellow just
beat you at full power.

47
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,219
Sir?

48
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,139
What is this?

49
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:31,308
Krypto!

50
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,937
What the hey, dude?
I-I thought...

51
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,230
You destroyed the whole...

52
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,941
Superman robots, I thought I
told you to keep an eye on him.

53
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,151
We feed the canine,
but he is unruly.

54
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,570
And he realizes we are
not flesh and blood

55
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:47,115
and couldn't, in our heart of hearts,
care less whether he lives or dies.

56
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,576
Stop, Krypto, leave it.

57
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,746
Ow. Ow! Stop. Ow. Stop it.

58
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,040
Krypto! Ow! Ow! Stop it. Stop.

59
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,125
Sit. Sit. Stay.

60
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,435
The alien is on its way back.

61
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,845
Your Superman has abandoned you!

62
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:55,601
The people of Boravia will not ignore
him inserting himself into our affairs.

63
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,858
Accelerate the portals.

64
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,401
Primed and ready.

65
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,486
T-Minus ten and counting.

66
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,738
Buckle up, we're going live.

67
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,781
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six…

68
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,283
Bravo, what do you
have on employees?

69
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,451
I'm inside Chocos,
Larry. No fatalities.

70
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,493
…five, four…

71
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,747
-Can't win 'em all.
-…three, two, one.

72
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,334
Target in sight.

73
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,378
-He's back. Your 5:00.
-Copy.

74
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:29,842
12C.

75
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:36,974
18A.

76
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,188
34B.

77
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:48,236
98Z.

78
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,405
8H.

79
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,494
74D.

80
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,041
44T!

81
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,596
-Reggie, can you watch?
-Yeah, yeah.

82
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,476
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

83
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:24,022
It's like he knows Superman's
every move before he makes it.

84
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,900
He does. He's been
studying him for years.

85
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,153
He's developed over 2,500
fight moves for any situation.

86
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,322
Superman!

87
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,200
Bravo, you got him?

88
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:39,079
Malik Ali, a local.

89
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,748
Lex, we have the Engineer.

90
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,377
The target has led
us to the ice castle.

91
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,379
The rumors are true.

92
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,923
I don't know how in the hell
this thing hasn't been spotted.

93
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:57,639
Mierda.

94
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,856
Comms, two to one.

95
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,401
Hijo de…

96
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,155
Lex, the entire structure
has descended into the ice.

97
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,657
We have what we
need. Return to base.

98
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,451
I can drill into it, Lex.

99
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,495
Your pride won't be making
our choices today, Angela.

100
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:20,412
Thank you.

101
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,122
We'll need more than
you when we enter.

102
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:25,250
Comms, one to two.

103
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,170
We've done what we
need to do. Wrap it up.

104
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:34,092
The United States will continue to feel
the wrath of the Hammer of Boravia.

105
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:35,801
It's me, Mali.

106
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:37,804
Once I gave you free falafel,

107
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,349
when you saved a woman
from being hit by a taxi.

108
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:41,517
Are you all right, Superman?

109
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,727
Mali, you gotta get outta
here. It's not safe.

110
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,396
You saved us so many
times. Now it's our turn.

111
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,524
This is your last warning.

112
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,984
Oh!

113
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,032
Maybe you shouldn't have done
that thing in Jarhanpur, Superman.

114
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,165
Flawless, people.

115
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:06,875
Way to bring it home!

116
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,222
Decelerate all portals.

117
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:05,726
-Ultraman's back.
-Ultraman!

118
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,312
Ultraman! You did so good.

119
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,771
Yes!

120
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,466
Sorry about that. I'm so sorry.

121
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,675
Sorry.

122
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:42,638
-Morning, Nino.
-Good morning, Clark.

123
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,271
Do these unelected
met a humans

124
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,941
think they can dictate
international policy?

125
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,192
It's outrageous.

126
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,778
It's a big story. Put
it above the fold.

127
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,404
That's where we put it.

128
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,949
-You're late again, Kent.
-Sorry, Perry.

129
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:05,035
-Hey, loser.
-Hey, Steve.

130
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,871
Hey, what do you got
against adverbs, Kent?

131
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:11,124
How are we supposed to know how we
feel when we read this malarkey?

132
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,462
In sports writing, you learn
the sentence is the modifier.

133
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,464
-Hey, Ma.
-"Ma!"

134
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,967
Hey, Clark!

135
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,719
Uh, me and Pa just
wanted to call

136
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:26,306
and say congratulations
on that front page.

137
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,308
Boy, that is something!

138
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:30,811
Hey, ask Ma if she barbecued
up any good roadkill lately.

139
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,355
-Shut up, Steve.
-Like, uh, possum or chitlins…

140
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:34,940
-What's that, Clark?
-Sorry, Ma,

141
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,066
I'm just in the middle
of a big news day here.

142
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,150
What are chitlins?

143
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,694
Chitlins are intestines.

144
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,988
Thanks, Cat. You
read this crud?

145
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,865
I thought it was great, Clark.

146
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:44,741
"Great"?

147
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,952
Yeah! Front page! Big time!

148
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,831
Well, we don't want
to keep you, but, uh,

149
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,041
wanted to say congrats,

150
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,836
and tell you we're
thinking 'bout you, Clark.

151
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:59,214
-It's been a minute.
-Tell him don't be a stranger.

152
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,592
Pa says, "Don't be a stranger."

153
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,594
I, uh… Yeah, I heard him, Ma.

154
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,304
Yeah, okay I gotta
go. I gotta run.

155
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:06,638
Yep, okay. Love you.

156
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:10,267
So, this guy just flew into midtown
and started attacking people,

157
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,102
demanding for
Superman to show up?

158
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,146
Yeah. It's all
there in my article.

159
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:16,107
Then I'd actually have to make
it through your writing, Clark.

160
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,317
Knowledge is worth
many sacrifices.

161
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,193
That isn't one of them.

162
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,069
Ha, ha, ha. Very funny, Lois.

163
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:23,030
-Oh, my God.
-He's so fine.

164
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:26,074
Twenty-two people in the hospital,
over 20 million in property damage.

165
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,076
-It does make you wonder.
-Wonder what?

166
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:31,205
As great as he is, maybe Superman
didn't completely think through

167
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,832
the ramifications of
the Boravia thing.

168
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:35,083
If this guy is
even from Boravia.

169
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,336
What do you mean? His name
is "the Hammer of Boravia."

170
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,755
Yeah, I doubt his parents
named him that, Jimmy.

171
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,924
We have no clue what his
actual goal was here.

172
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,385
I think it's pretty obvious the
goal was kicking Superman's ass.

173
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,429
Uh, he did... He didn't
completely kick Superman's ass.

174
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:47,471
Pretty thoroughly, Clark.

175
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:51,350
Show me! You show me
what ties there are

176
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:54,436
between Boravia
and this "Hammer!"

177
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,772
Yeah, see, Superman did say
he thought the, uh, Hammer

178
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,357
might be faking a
Boravian accent.

179
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,816
Superman said that?

180
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,940
Yeah, I interviewed him
right afterwards. Great guy.

181
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:06,073
You know, it's funny that you keep getting
all these interviews with Superman, Clark.

182
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:08,867
I don't think there's anything
funny about good journalism, Lois.

183
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:10,285
Uh-huh.

184
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:15,415
The relationship between
Boravia and United States

185
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:19,419
has been like iron for 30 years,

186
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:22,965
until Superman came along.

187
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,052
What you're looking
at, my friends,

188
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,806
is the most powerful
being on Planet Earth:

189
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,183
Ultraman.

190
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:35,185
You created this man?

191
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:38,355
Ooh. Check this
out. The Engineer.

192
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,983
A former special operative,
whose blood I infused

193
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:43,485
with microscopic machines
called "nanites,"

194
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:47,239
which she can form into
anything she can imagine.

195
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:52,035
And, of course, you're familiar with
my flying armored forces, the Raptors.

196
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:56,999
All together, they're an unstoppable
force we call PlanetWatch.

197
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:01,837
More than capable of containing
any otherworldly threat.

198
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:06,466
So you want the
Defense Department

199
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,053
to hire your met a humans
to take down the Kryptonian?

200
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:13,724
After Superman acted with violence
against our Boravian allies,

201
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:14,850
I think it'd be
worth considering.

202
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:16,810
Big Blue stopped a war.

203
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,604
Naive, maybe, but
well-intentioned.

204
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:23,108
Well, I don't know the intentions of
an unattended firehose, General Flag.

205
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:25,485
I just do what I can
not to be splashed.

206
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:28,488
-Mr. Luthor…
-The disarming Director Crawley.

207
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,574
The country of
Boravia has purchased

208
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,826
over 80 billion
dollars' worth of arms

209
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,995
from LuthorCorp in
the past two years.

210
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:36,788
-And?
-And no one would profit more

211
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:39,583
from a war with Boravia
and Jarhanpur than you.

212
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,960
A cynic might say that having
Superman out of the way

213
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,337
might not be bad for business.

214
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,340
Well, what's particularly
bad for business is dying.

215
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:49,468
And I have a distinct feeling
that's where we're all headed

216
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,011
with the Kryptonian
running wild.

217
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:53,347
So we're gonna lock up
all met a humans now?

218
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,807
Look, other met a humans
aren't going off half-cocked,

219
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,601
interfering in foreign affairs.

220
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,937
They don't have... And
I have proof of this...

221
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,523
a hidden headquarters
in Antarctica

222
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:05,233
that violates 12
international treaties.

223
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,444
And they aren't aliens.

224
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:11,198
Shouldn't all that be
more than enough reason

225
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:15,910
for PlanetWatch to at least bring
the Kryptonian in for questioning?

226
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,038
Admittedly, I'm not comfortable

227
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:22,000
with a being from another planet
as dangerous as him on the loose.

228
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,461
But the optics?
Superman is popular.

229
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,047
Less so every day,
according to chatter online.

230
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,008
Not to mention the potential
risk of failing to contain him.

231
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,469
I assure you, Secretary,
we can contain him.

232
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:34,680
Yeah, they got this stuff, uh…

233
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,056
What's this Kryptonite
stuff called?

234
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,851
-It's called Kryptonite.
-Well, it kills him, right?

235
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,978
As far as we can ascertain,
there's none left on the planet.

236
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,813
I have a workaround
for that as well.

237
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,565
You know what? It
doesn't matter, Lex.

238
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,608
Because without solid
proof of malicious intent,

239
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:47,985
it's just not worth the risk.

240
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,942
What are you doing here?

241
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,736
Three months ago, we
had our first date.

242
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:34,573
And so, to celebrate, I am
making you your favorite:

243
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,074
breakfast for dinner.

244
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,492
That's your favorite.

245
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:39,119
You love breakfast.

246
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:41,955
Yeah, for breakfast.
You love it for dinner.

247
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,310
-What?
-It was very funny today.

248
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,394
-What?
-It was hilarious,

249
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:05,813
the little back-and-forth
we had going.

250
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:06,563
Mm.

251
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,690
You giving me guff
for my article.

252
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:10,442
Jimmy was eating it up.

253
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:13,946
I wasn't acting, Clark. If you
keep interviewing yourself,

254
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,573
eventually people are
gonna figure it out.

255
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:17,991
But the glasses.

256
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:20,577
Yeah, they won't fool
everyone forever.

257
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:25,207
And ethically, these interviews
are hugely problematic.

258
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,210
I mean, y-you literally know
the questions in advance.

259
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,569
Okay, so I'll let
you interview me.

260
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,840
I'm pretty sure you
wouldn't like that.

261
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,842
Come on, Lois. I'm media savvy.

262
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:38,387
I can handle any question
that comes my way.

263
00:19:38,512 --> 00:19:40,138
Are you being serious right now?

264
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:41,931
Yeah.

265
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:44,685
You'd let me interview
you as Superman?

266
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:47,354
Sure.

267
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:49,773
How about now?

268
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:53,901
Um…

269
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,530
Ready?

270
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,199
Let's do it, Cronkite.

271
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:01,243
Superman.

272
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:03,287
Miss Lane.

273
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:05,372
Recently, you've come under

274
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,457
a lot of fire for
what some might...

275
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,457
I don't know if it's
a lot of fire, but...

276
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:08,792
It's a lot.

277
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,127
Today the Secretary of Defense

278
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,504
said he was gonna look into
your actions in Boravia.

279
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:14,715
That... That's funny?

280
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,634
It's not "funny"
funny, it's just, um…

281
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:20,262
I mean, come on. My
actions? I stopped a war.

282
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,890
-Maybe.
-Uh, not "maybe." I did.

283
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,850
Okay. How?

284
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,686
Well, Boravia invaded Jarhanpur,

285
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,938
and I showed up and told
them that wasn't right.

286
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:30,689
And?

287
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:33,025
And… smashed some
tanks and things

288
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,986
and a couple of planes
and some other stuff.

289
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,448
There were no casualties
and no significant injuries.

290
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:40,574
Did you interact at all

291
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:43,035
with the President of
Boravia, Vasil Ghurkos?

292
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,411
A very small amount.

293
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,913
What's a very small amount?

294
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:47,831
That was between us.

295
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,002
This is all on the record.

296
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:55,547
Yeah, but that conversation
was between the two of us.

297
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,508
Yeah, and I would
ask that question

298
00:20:57,591 --> 00:20:59,259
whether or not I knew
the answer to it.

299
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:00,761
-Really?
-Really.

300
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,389
After I stopped the war,

301
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:06,433
I went to see Ghurkos.

302
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:07,518
Where?

303
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,645
In the capital of Luchebic,
at the Royal Palace.

304
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:10,395
And?

305
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:12,648
And I took a private
audience with Ghurkos.

306
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:13,524
How?

307
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:16,151
I flew him out to
the desert, and I…

308
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:17,986
And you…

309
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,030
And I placed him
against a cactus.

310
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,740
A cactus?

311
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:23,825
So… torture?

312
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:24,785
No. Not torture.

313
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,912
Its spikes were like…
not even that big.

314
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:28,205
What did you say?

315
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:31,124
I told him that if he ever
messes with Jarhanpur again,

316
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,793
he'll have to
personally answer to me.

317
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:34,253
What did you mean by that?

318
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:35,838
That if such events occurred,

319
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,423
we would have a more serious
discussion, that's all.

320
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:40,968
More serious than tearing
up his back on a cactus?

321
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,178
Ghurkos was gonna kill people.

322
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:43,554
You seem to keep
forgetting that...

323
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:46,139
So, in effect, you
illegally entered a country,

324
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:47,558
inserting yourself in the middle

325
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:48,851
-of an incredibly heated…
-No, no, no. Hold on.

326
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:49,935
-Geopolitical situation…
-Hold on a second.

327
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,562
…siding with a
nation, Jarhanpur,

328
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:53,021
which historically has not been

329
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:54,607
-a friend to the US…
-Jarhanpur has changed.

330
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:56,484
…against a nation that's
technically our ally,

331
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,735
and then threatened to
murder their head of state.

332
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,405
First of all, whether or not
Jarhanpur is an imperfect country

333
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:03,282
does not give another nation
the right to invade it.

334
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:04,700
Yes, but the Boravian
government maintains

335
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:06,285
they're freeing
the Jarhanpurians

336
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:07,411
from a tyrannical regime.

337
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,121
Yes, but you know
that's very silly.

338
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:10,038
I do?

339
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:13,208
The Boravian government, of
all people, is saying this?

340
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:14,001
Come on!

341
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,669
This is on the record, Superman.

342
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,129
Now... No. Now, see…

343
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:18,589
Now you're being
dishonest, Lois.

344
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,424
How am I being dishonest?

345
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,302
-What are you...? Stop.
-Where's the button?

346
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,429
You're being dishonest because
you know as well as I do

347
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:26,972
that the Boravian government
is not well-intentioned.

348
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:30,434
I think that's almost certainly
the case, but do I know that?

349
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:31,517
No, I don't.

350
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:34,021
Can we go on now?

351
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:35,731
Yeah, fine.

352
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:36,982
-I don't... You do it.
-I…

353
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:40,811
You think this is going well?

354
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:43,197
Do I think this
is going well? Um…

355
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:45,616
I think I'm doing a good job.

356
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,079
Superman, did you consult
with the President

357
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:51,496
before entering
Boravian airspace?

358
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:54,750
-No.
-The Secretary of Defense?

359
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,543
-No.
-Or any US official

360
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:58,378
before you took matters
into your own hands

361
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,255
and decided unilaterally
how to handle

362
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:01,340
this extremely
delicate situation?

363
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:04,051
Ghurkos and his goons
were going to kill people.

364
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:05,427
Yes, but the results

365
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:07,638
of you seemingly acting
as a representative

366
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:08,597
of the United States will cause…

367
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:09,640
I wasn't representing anybody…

368
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:10,432
…more problems around the world.

369
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:11,266
…except for me, and-and…

370
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,269
-More than a war that lasted…
-…myself and, and, and…

371
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:14,144
…between 12 and 24 hours…

372
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:15,103
…good, I don't know, doing good.

373
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:16,522
…and was just replacing

374
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:18,023
one tyrannical
regime with another?

375
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,399
Is that really how you feel?

376
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:22,611
I'm not the one being
interviewed, Superman, but…

377
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:24,988
I question it.

378
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:27,741
Yeah, I would question
myself in the same situation

379
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,452
and hold off a beat and
consider the consequences.

380
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:32,538
People were going to die!

381
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:45,384
Okay, I'd like to change
the subject, if I could.

382
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,261
Okay.

383
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:49,471
You've gotten a lot of heat
on social media lately.

384
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:50,597
I don't read that stuff.

385
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:52,766
Superman doesn't have
time for selfies.

386
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:55,435
-Third person?
-Hmm?

387
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,480
You're referring to yourself
in the third person now?

388
00:23:57,563 --> 00:23:58,773
No, it was just a
thing I came up with

389
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:00,816
that I thought I'd try to
work into the next interview.

390
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:02,151
This is on the record, Superman.

391
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:03,778
Okay, well, not the
part where I said that.

392
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:06,321
-Yes, that part.
-No, that part was an aside.

393
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:07,322
That was off the record.

394
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:10,158
You have to say "off the
record" beforehand, not after.

395
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:11,702
Why are you being like this?

396
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,036
Fine, I-I won't write

397
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,498
that you spend your spare time
trying to think up soundbites.

398
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:16,874
Which are terrible, by the way.

399
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,209
-Social media.
-Yes.

400
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:21,336
As you may know,
or maybe you don't,

401
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,214
since you claim not to
read any of that stuff...

402
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:24,089
Very seldomly.

403
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:25,841
Maybe sometimes people
catch you reading it

404
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:27,467
and looking very upset.

405
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:29,136
Okay, well, you can't use that.

406
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:32,264
People on social media are
suspicious because you are…

407
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:34,474
…an alien, yes?

408
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:35,559
Yes.

409
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:38,145
I've been very honest about
that. From the beginning.

410
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,522
I come from a planet
called Krypton.

411
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:43,150
-Okay.
-Which is gone now, by the way.

412
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,736
Destroyed. Along with
all of my history.

413
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:47,571
My parents.

414
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,489
They sent me here as a
baby to save my life.

415
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:50,616
Here, where?

416
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:52,899
I'm not gonna say that. You
know I'm not gonna say that.

417
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:56,454
Okay.

418
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:02,711
What do you know about these
biological parents of yours?

419
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:06,465
Just that they sent me
here to serve humanity

420
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:09,968
and to help the world
to be a better place.

421
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:12,095
-They said that?
-They did.

422
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:15,349
They sent a message
along with me.

423
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:20,062
That message is
why I do what I do.

424
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:21,855
I cherish it more than anything.

425
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,608
Because you understand now,

426
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:26,818
there are an awful lot of
people out there maintaining

427
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:30,072
you're here for more
nefarious purposes.

428
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:32,282
Hashtag Superspy.
Hashtag Supershit.

429
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:33,951
Supershit!? Come on, Lois!

430
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:35,619
You know that one
specifically irritates me!

431
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:37,871
This is on the record, Clark!

432
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:38,872
I didn't make it up.

433
00:25:38,956 --> 00:25:40,958
It's what people on the
Internet are saying.

434
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:42,668
I'm gonna go.

435
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,545
-Really?
-Yeah.

436
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,588
Come on, Clark. Don't do this.

437
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:47,798
I'm not doing anything.

438
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,800
No? No, that's not you,
packing up your shit

439
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,343
and walking out of an interview?

440
00:25:51,426 --> 00:25:52,636
I'm not walking out
of an interview,

441
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:53,804
-I'm just... It's late.
-No, this is what you do

442
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,014
every time you're
faced with conflict.

443
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:56,307
-I'm not doing anything.
-You get mad. You pout.

444
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,475
-Then you pretend…
-I'm not mad.

445
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:59,059
-…like nothing's wrong.
-Nothing is wrong.

446
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,144
Look, I gave you a
nice, long interview.

447
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:03,438
Longer than I ever gave
myself, by the way.

448
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:06,024
Oh, you can time your imaginary
interviews with yourself?

449
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:07,150
That's a thing you can do?

450
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:08,485
You got a lot of good stuff.

451
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,821
Some stuff you can't use.

452
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:12,656
I am well aware.

453
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:15,075
I knew this would never work.

454
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:17,703
What does that mean?

455
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:22,123
Lois?

456
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,794
-What does that mean?
-Nothing, I just…

457
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:28,547
I told you I wasn't
good at relationships.

458
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:34,218
Okay.

459
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:06,960
The real Antarctica!

460
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:08,670
So cool!

461
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,221
It was right ahead.

462
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,556
But how are we going
to gain access?

463
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:22,559
Oh, ye of little faith.

464
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,442
Oh, wow!

465
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:45,541
Oh, my God!

466
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:01,807
Superman, I preemptively
put up the soothing...

467
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,519
Oh, my. I do apologize, but
this is a restricted area.

468
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:09,064
Wait. Can we talk...

469
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:11,585
This is what we came for.

470
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:14,213
Hopefully, there's
something on here

471
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:15,672
we can use to
convince the general

472
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:18,175
Superman requires
immediate action.

473
00:29:18,884 --> 00:29:21,845
I can't stand the met a
humans, but he's so much worse.

474
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:24,681
Super… man.

475
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:27,684
He's not a man. He's an it.

476
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,938
A thing with a cocky
grin and a stupid outfit

477
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,231
that's somehow become
the focal point

478
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:34,358
of the entire
world's conversation.

479
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:37,736
Nothing's felt right
since he showed up.

480
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:40,280
I know, Lex.

481
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:43,909
I've sacrificed my own
humanity to help get rid of it.

482
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,619
Can you get in?

483
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,251
Might take a while.

484
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:53,989
What if the Kryptonian shows up?

485
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:55,128
Don't worry.

486
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:58,048
I'm creating a… distraction.

487
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,883
What?

488
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,426
This message…

489
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,971
…from his parents.

490
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:47,097
It's damaged, but there's more.

491
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:48,932
It's…

492
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:50,976
I can recover the rest.

493
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:14,499
Whoa! Got it!

494
00:31:14,583 --> 00:31:15,667
Let it out!

495
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:27,429
It's an awfully
small distraction.

496
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,139
It'll get bigger.

497
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,491
Get! Go!

498
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:54,081
Get! Get outta here!

499
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:43,214
The giant animal

500
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:44,965
was first spotted
early this morning

501
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:48,051
in a Jitters coffee shop
about seven feet tall,

502
00:32:48,135 --> 00:32:49,970
but it has apparently
been growing.

503
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,357
Everybody okay?

504
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:08,071
Hey, buddy. Eyes up here.

505
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:49,446
Deep, slow breaths, ma'am.
You're gonna be fine.

506
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:04,962
Everybody, clear the area.

507
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:09,299
He's just so cheap,
like, so obnoxious.

508
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:10,551
You know what I mean?

509
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:13,719
You can afford $1,000
concert tickets…

510
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:15,806
Finally a bit of good news amid
the chaos here this morning.

511
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,725
The Justice Gang has
arrived on the scene.

512
00:34:18,809 --> 00:34:21,937
That's Green Lantern,
Hawkgirl and Mr. Terrific.

513
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,022
They're funded by the
LordTech corporation.

514
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:25,398
Get him!

515
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:32,655
Hey!

516
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:00,642
Heel, boy!

517
00:35:10,277 --> 00:35:11,820
-What's the skinny?
-Its hide is tough,

518
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:13,739
but, uh, it's off balance.

519
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:14,740
I've been trying
to figure out a way

520
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:15,949
to get it out of here alive.

521
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:18,160
Get it someplace
where we can study it.

522
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:20,787
-Oh, come on, man.
-What?

523
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:23,207
Go for its eyes!

524
00:35:39,932 --> 00:35:43,227
My knee! Guy, help!

525
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,937
I made giant oven mitts!

526
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:47,731
Good for you, asshole! I'm
getting blinked to death!

527
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:04,748
Come on, be careful!

528
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:14,424
Oh!

529
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:16,760
Good gosh! There's gotta
be a better way to do this.

530
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:44,121
Come on.

531
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:05,226
Authorities are saying
there haven't been

532
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:06,894
any signs yet of loss of life,

533
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:09,396
thanks to Metropolis
hometown hero, Superman,

534
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:12,024
but the damage to property
could be in the millions.

535
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:12,941
City spokespeople…

536
00:37:13,025 --> 00:37:15,694
How's it going with that
guy you were seeing?

537
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,988
You were saying you
weren't sure about it?

538
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:20,532
Yeah. He's…

539
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:23,076
A little strange.

540
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:33,170
Ooh! Kaiju steaks
all around, huh?

541
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:34,880
I was hoping we could capture it

542
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:36,924
and take it to an
intergalactic zoo or…

543
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:40,010
…at least euthanize
it less painfully.

544
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:41,929
Come on, bro. Don't
be such a wuss.

545
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:45,599
'Ey! Just another day in the
life of the Justice Gang!

546
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:46,725
Not our name.

547
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:47,935
It's just a working name.

548
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:49,645
Could very well prove
to be permanent though.

549
00:37:49,728 --> 00:37:51,855
-Probably not!
-Good chance though, I'm saying.

550
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:53,357
You okay? Everybody okay?

551
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,525
Just like to say thank you

552
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:57,444
on behalf of LordTech Industries
for the opportunity...

553
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:00,739
Why is nobody clapping?

554
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:09,665
Come here.

555
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:12,417
This has to be BS.

556
00:38:14,795 --> 00:38:16,130
Well, they couldn't
be mistaken?

557
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:16,880
Oh, no.

558
00:38:16,964 --> 00:38:19,383
Well, that sounds
very disturbing, Lex.

559
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:20,968
Twenty-eight of the
world's top linguists

560
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:23,303
have confirmed the translation

561
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:25,472
and 30 of the top
forensic computer techs

562
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:28,559
have confirmed the validity
of the footage itself.

563
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:30,143
Any chance they're mistaken?

564
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:32,646
Unfortunately, no.

565
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:34,648
-You have the footage?
-Yes.

566
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:35,607
Let's take a look.

567
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:40,112
We love you more
than heaven, our son.

568
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:41,738
We love you more than land.

569
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:45,868
Our beloved home is
soon to be gone forever.

570
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:48,454
But hope vitalizes our hearts,

571
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,914
and that hope is you, Kal-El.

572
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:53,793
We have searched the universe

573
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:55,794
for a home where you
can do the most good.

574
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:58,630
And live out Krypton's truth.

575
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:00,091
That place is Earth.

576
00:39:00,174 --> 00:39:01,592
I don't get it.
What's bad about that?

577
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:07,097
The people there are simple

578
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:09,057
and profoundly confused.

579
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:13,020
Weak of mind and
spirit and body.

580
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,148
Lord over the planet

581
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:17,858
as the last son of Krypton.

582
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:21,278
Dispatch of anyone

583
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:23,822
unable or unwilling
to serve you, Kal-EI.

584
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:27,910
Take as many wives as you can,

585
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:31,038
so your genes and
Krypton's might and legacy

586
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:32,998
will live on in
this new frontier.

587
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:37,461
Do us proud, our beloved son.

588
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:39,379
Rule without mercy.

589
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:42,716
But what about all the kind acts

590
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:44,718
Superman has performed
over the years,

591
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,595
saving countless lives?

592
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,848
No. He's grooming us.

593
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:52,351
Lulling us into complacency,

594
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:55,062
so he can dominate
without resistance,

595
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:56,688
forging a path for his

596
00:39:56,772 --> 00:39:59,191
super-powered descendants
to rule the Earth.

597
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:05,739
I will not accept
that. Will you?

598
00:40:08,784 --> 00:40:11,411
-You seem upset.
-I'm…

599
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:14,288
I'm scared.

600
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:16,708
I will admit that, I am scared.

601
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:23,131
Because who knows how large
his secret harem is already?

602
00:40:44,486 --> 00:40:48,615
Oh, hell no! Let
me in! I'm serious!

603
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,163
Dude, you got a secret harem?

604
00:40:55,247 --> 00:40:56,707
No, Guy, of course I
don't have a harem.

605
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,585
If any of that message
is even remotely true,

606
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:02,462
then you are exactly
the kind of alien threat

607
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:04,798
I was commandeered by
the Green Lantern Corps

608
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:06,383
to protect this planet against.

609
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:09,428
-Back off, Guy!
-Oh.

610
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,264
Make a move, Big Blue.

611
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:14,183
Guy, relax.

612
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,894
Was the message real or not?

613
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,856
The first half. The
first half is… is real.

614
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:22,399
The second half was damaged

615
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:24,359
in the t-trip from
Krypton to Earth.

616
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:26,612
-So it's-it's gotta be doctored.
-No way, Clark.

617
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:28,739
I know these computer
forensics guys.

618
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:32,409
They're not gonna say it's
legit unless they are sure.

619
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:34,828
I'm so sorry, man,

620
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:36,705
but there's no way
that message is fake.

621
00:41:37,623 --> 00:41:39,023
Where'd they get
the footage though?

622
00:41:53,013 --> 00:41:55,432
Are you considering bringing
Superman in for questioning?

623
00:41:55,516 --> 00:41:59,102
We're talking with the President,
and we are reviewing our options now.

624
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:00,396
I'm sorry, but I have
to go, Miss Lane.

625
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:02,119
And if you did,
when would that...

626
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:03,106
You buying this?

627
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,858
I don't put anything
past Luthor, Rick.

628
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,986
But the message is authentic.

629
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:11,782
If the Kryptonian is a
danger, we have to act.

630
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:13,367
I was a big Superman fan.

631
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:14,869
I supported him all the
time online and stuff,

632
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:15,994
but now?

633
00:42:16,078 --> 00:42:17,121
I mean, I hope he rots in hell.

634
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:18,289
I don't care. You're
supposed to get out!

635
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:19,248
Get me some pictures.

636
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:20,290
We have a deadline!

637
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:21,375
Where is he? Get there now!

638
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:22,292
Don't call me Chief.

639
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:23,836
Okay. I'm gonna do my job.

640
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:26,088
It's no wonder the Kryptonian

641
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:30,133
interfered with
Boravia's interests.

642
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:34,972
Boravia wants to save
the people of Jarhanpur.

643
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:38,600
And Superman wants to
keep them enslaved!

644
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:44,481
Also, from what I hear,

645
00:42:44,565 --> 00:42:50,654
he finds Boravian women the
most physically attractive

646
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:55,492
and wants to add them
to his secret harem.

647
00:42:58,036 --> 00:42:59,955
I have a question,
President Ghurkos.

648
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:01,915
Thank you.

649
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:07,087
That couldn't have gone
better, Mr. President!

650
00:43:07,504 --> 00:43:10,174
You were so handsome
and dynamic!

651
00:43:10,507 --> 00:43:11,967
Wonderful!

652
00:43:12,301 --> 00:43:14,761
Very handsome! Very handsome!

653
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:18,599
Go! Leave me be!

654
00:43:56,845 --> 00:43:58,305
We did it, Lex!

655
00:43:58,388 --> 00:44:01,308
I wouldn't celebrate until
the alien is off the board.

656
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:04,061
Oh, here. I brought you a
donut. From Dough's Holes.

657
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:06,021
New shop in Park
Ridge, of all places.

658
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:09,358
The fake message,
a stroke of genius.

659
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:10,275
It's not fake.

660
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:13,111
He is here to kill
us. I knew it!

661
00:44:13,195 --> 00:44:14,363
At Superman's fortress,

662
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:16,740
I hoped to get the knowledge
to help destroy him.

663
00:44:16,823 --> 00:44:18,158
Little did I know,
his own parents

664
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:19,493
would be providing it.

665
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:21,161
Oh.

666
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:22,454
Right? Yeah.

667
00:44:22,538 --> 00:44:25,165
Been thinking of opening
one in my half of Jarhanpur.

668
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:36,051
Four. Four. What happened?

669
00:44:36,134 --> 00:44:40,889
I tried to protect Superman.

670
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,855
How did Luthor get in here?
It's keyed into my DNA.

671
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:51,441
Must protect Superman.

672
00:44:51,525 --> 00:44:53,902
Four.

673
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:58,490
I'm sorry, friend.

674
00:45:10,085 --> 00:45:11,085
Krypto?

675
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:17,342
Krypto!

676
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:23,834
Well, yeah, that's
gonna become...

677
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:28,228
-Lex, I tried to stop him.
-It's fine, Heather.

678
00:45:28,312 --> 00:45:30,022
Superman, we finally meet.

679
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:32,065
-Would you like a coffee or tea?
-Where's the dog?

680
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:33,108
Dog?

681
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:34,985
The dog, Luthor!
You took the dog!

682
00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:36,737
That's right, Eve,
get all of this.

683
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:42,784
Where's the dog?

684
00:45:42,868 --> 00:45:46,914
I have no clue what
you're talking about.

685
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:51,877
He's just a dog.

686
00:45:52,002 --> 00:45:54,421
I don't know what dog
you're talking about.

687
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:55,905
Ugly dog in a cape?

688
00:45:56,381 --> 00:45:57,799
-What did you say?
-Hmm?

689
00:45:58,592 --> 00:46:00,344
I didn't say anything.

690
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:01,970
You heard what he said!

691
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:03,555
You heard him! He took him!

692
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:05,599
I mean, it seems to me,

693
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:09,937
that the only rabid animal
around here is Superman.

694
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,357
Ever since the discovery of
the Kryptonian's master plan,

695
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,692
he's gone off the deep
end. Thoughts, Chris?

696
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:17,528
Can't say I'm
surprised, Cleavis.

697
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:19,113
It's guys like this,
they always got

698
00:46:19,196 --> 00:46:20,948
a whole bunch of
dark, ugly secrets.

699
00:46:21,031 --> 00:46:22,824
What do you mean,
"guys like this?"

700
00:46:22,908 --> 00:46:24,948
Thinks he's better
than everybody else.

701
00:46:25,202 --> 00:46:27,454
Makes this declaration
he's against killing people

702
00:46:27,538 --> 00:46:28,413
unless it's
absolutely necessary.

703
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:30,414
Really, dude?

704
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,626
It kinda sounds like you're
trying to make the guys

705
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:34,712
who are a little more edgier
than you look like jerks.

706
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:36,130
-Know what I mean?
-Mm-hmm.

707
00:46:36,213 --> 00:46:38,799
A lot of these guys, these…

708
00:46:38,882 --> 00:46:40,008
Heroes from the magazines,

709
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:41,469
they're obsessed with me.

710
00:46:41,552 --> 00:46:43,512
'Cause I'm more
jacked than they are.

711
00:46:43,595 --> 00:46:44,429
They know they don't have...

712
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:50,060
You have a dog?

713
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:54,189
No, not really. It's more
of a… foster situation.

714
00:47:00,946 --> 00:47:02,155
Cocoa.

715
00:47:08,787 --> 00:47:10,205
You were out there helping them?

716
00:47:14,126 --> 00:47:16,003
Oh, no, that's just, uh...

717
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:17,408
That's just some
dimensional imp.

718
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:20,841
They've got that handled.
I was looking for the dog.

719
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:29,975
You okay?

720
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:33,353
The footage is not what
it looks like, Lois.

721
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:35,898
Okay.

722
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:38,317
The ship my parents sent me
in was damaged in transit,

723
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,069
so I only ever heard the
first part of the message.

724
00:47:42,237 --> 00:47:44,656
And I believed I
knew how it ended.

725
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:48,660
That my parents had sent me here
to serve the people of Earth

726
00:47:48,744 --> 00:47:50,495
and to be a good man.

727
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:55,292
I'm not here to rule
over anybody, Lois.

728
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:59,963
I never thought you were,
even for a moment, Clark.

729
00:48:08,931 --> 00:48:10,171
Oh, that's really good.

730
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:14,102
I'm sorry we fought.

731
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:16,437
Me too.

732
00:48:16,772 --> 00:48:18,607
But we're bound to, though.

733
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:20,692
We're so different.

734
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:24,446
I was just some punk rock kid
from Bakerline, and you're…

735
00:48:25,531 --> 00:48:26,740
Superman.

736
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:29,326
-I'm punk rock.
-You are not punk rock.

737
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:30,911
I like the Strangle-Fellows,

738
00:48:30,994 --> 00:48:33,080
and the P.O.D.s and
the Mighty Crabjoys.

739
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:35,666
Those are pop radio bands.
They're not punk rock.

740
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:38,335
The Mighty Crabjoys suck.

741
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,420
Okay, well, a lot
of people love 'em.

742
00:48:43,632 --> 00:48:46,677
My point is, I question
everything and everyone.

743
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:49,930
You trust everyone

744
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:53,267
and think everyone
you've ever met is, like…

745
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:55,727
Beautiful.

746
00:48:59,648 --> 00:49:01,692
Maybe that's the real punk rock.

747
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,955
Lois, what did you
mean when you said

748
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:16,456
that you knew this
would never work?

749
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:20,878
I don't know.

750
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:27,718
I'm gonna go.

751
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:29,928
The DOJ has a warrant
out for my arrest,

752
00:49:30,012 --> 00:49:32,055
so I'm gonna turn myself in.

753
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:34,391
Wait, what? Why?

754
00:49:34,766 --> 00:49:36,810
Maybe they'll take me
wherever they took the dog.

755
00:49:36,894 --> 00:49:38,020
I don't know how
else to find him.

756
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:39,146
It's a dog.

757
00:49:39,229 --> 00:49:41,523
Yeah, and he's not even
a very good one, but…

758
00:49:42,608 --> 00:49:44,109
He's out there alone.

759
00:49:44,818 --> 00:49:46,195
And he's probably scared.

760
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:04,545
I love you, Lois.

761
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:08,425
I probably should have told
you that a long time ago.

762
00:50:27,236 --> 00:50:28,904
Is that necessary?

763
00:50:28,987 --> 00:50:30,739
I'm coming in on my own accord.

764
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:34,368
No one read me my rights.

765
00:50:34,826 --> 00:50:36,453
Courts decided those
rights don't apply

766
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:38,247
to extraterrestrial organisms.

767
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:39,665
Therefore, at this
point, Superman,

768
00:50:39,748 --> 00:50:41,375
you don't have any
rights to read.

769
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:42,960
The government is
very well aware

770
00:50:43,043 --> 00:50:44,920
of the potential
limitations detaining you,

771
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:46,588
so we've outsourced
your confinement

772
00:50:46,672 --> 00:50:48,924
and your interrogation
to PlanetWatch.

773
00:50:49,007 --> 00:50:50,092
PlanetWatch?

774
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:52,636
I'm sorry about this.

Luthor.

786
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:07,836
Your obsession with me is
getting a little creepy.

787
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:10,839
Don't worry. Tall, dark,
and Martian isn't my type.

788
00:52:10,923 --> 00:52:12,925
-Kryptonian.
-Eh, same diff.

789
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:23,143
Where are we?

790
00:52:23,227 --> 00:52:24,728
A pocket universe.

791
00:52:24,811 --> 00:52:27,523
I replicated the Big Bang with
a LuthorCorp mega-collider,

792
00:52:27,606 --> 00:52:30,484
tearing a tiny hole between
the two universal fabrics.

793
00:52:31,443 --> 00:52:34,363
I'm able to access it from
multiple dimensional portals

794
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:35,656
I've set up around the globe.

795
00:52:36,657 --> 00:52:40,244
Rex, the met a human
known as the Element Man,

796
00:52:40,327 --> 00:52:43,038
has been called into service
for a specific purpose.

797
00:52:43,121 --> 00:52:45,874
He can metamorphose into
any known substance.

798
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:50,838
Even substances foreign
to this planet, like…

799
00:52:58,053 --> 00:52:59,847
…Kryptonite.

800
00:53:02,975 --> 00:53:05,310
Once again, Vasil
Ghurkos is sending troops

801
00:53:05,394 --> 00:53:07,187
to the Jarhanpurian border.

802
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:08,272
Superman's been
out of commission

803
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:10,858
less than a day, and already
Boravia's pulling this crap?

804
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:13,193
-Right?
-What?

805
00:53:13,277 --> 00:53:14,653
Sorry, I'm trying to figure out

806
00:53:14,736 --> 00:53:16,947
how Lex Luthor's
connected to all this.

807
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:17,948
How's that a mystery?

808
00:53:18,031 --> 00:53:20,742
LuthorCorp sells arms to
Boravia, Boravia goes to war,

809
00:53:20,826 --> 00:53:23,453
Luthor sells more arms
and gets richer than ever.

810
00:53:23,537 --> 00:53:25,205
-Nope.
-No?

811
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:26,415
Uh-uh.

812
00:53:26,915 --> 00:53:28,584
I have a connection at BodaBank.

813
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:31,879
Boda handles the transactions
between LuthorCorp and Boravia.

814
00:53:32,004 --> 00:53:33,338
Yes, LuthorCorp sold them

815
00:53:33,422 --> 00:53:35,299
approximately 80 billion
dollars' worth of arms,

816
00:53:35,382 --> 00:53:36,425
but for those arms,

817
00:53:36,508 --> 00:53:39,803
Boravia paid only
1.625 billion dollars.

818
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:42,181
So Luthor gave them
arms for free? For what?

819
00:53:42,264 --> 00:53:46,894
That's the 78 billion,
375-million-dollar question.

820
00:53:46,977 --> 00:53:48,354
Have you found out where
they're holding Superman?

821
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:50,230
No one in the government'll say.

822
00:53:50,314 --> 00:53:52,691
Luthor seems to be working
to disable Superman

823
00:53:52,774 --> 00:53:55,652
just so he can't stop the
invasion of Jarhanpur.

824
00:53:55,736 --> 00:53:56,736
Why?

825
00:53:56,987 --> 00:53:58,614
That's way too much sugar, Lois.

826
00:53:58,697 --> 00:54:01,283
I party like a rock
star, choir boy.

827
00:54:01,366 --> 00:54:03,285
Still can't hide the
taste of petroleum.

828
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:04,702
God!

829
00:54:21,803 --> 00:54:23,597
Lex is holding Superman
in a pocket universe.

830
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,723
A what?

831
00:54:24,806 --> 00:54:26,016
I don't know what a
pocket universe is.

832
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:27,226
Neither does my source.

833
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:29,478
They don't know anything
about anything, really.

834
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:31,647
But for sure he's in
a pocket universe.

835
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:32,814
Who's your source?

836
00:54:32,898 --> 00:54:35,150
I can't say, but you owe me.

837
00:54:35,651 --> 00:54:36,651
Big time.

838
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:38,277
Like…

839
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:42,074
I can't even tell you how big.

840
00:54:44,952 --> 00:54:46,995
I love you, Jimmy Olsen.

841
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:48,539
-I love you.
-Love you.

842
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:05,764
Just my Monkey-Bots here,
farming outrage 24/7.

843
00:55:05,848 --> 00:55:07,391
Trashing you online.

844
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:09,476
Hashtag Supershit.

845
00:55:20,153 --> 00:55:21,488
Krypto.

846
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:26,201
How do you contain
a super dog?

847
00:55:27,536 --> 00:55:29,621
You beam super squirrels
into its brain.

848
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:33,333
We'll learn what we can.

849
00:55:34,251 --> 00:55:37,588
Then we'll put the varmint down.

850
00:55:38,505 --> 00:55:40,257
It will undoubtedly be painful.

851
00:55:41,258 --> 00:55:43,468
Mr. Luthor, please! I swear…

852
00:55:43,552 --> 00:55:46,305
This is our private
correctional institution.

853
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:48,932
Yeah, most cells are
rented out to governments

854
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:51,185
who want to keep
their incarcerations

855
00:55:51,268 --> 00:55:53,896
of political agitators private.

856
00:55:53,979 --> 00:55:56,565
Others are for more
personal transgressions.

857
00:55:56,899 --> 00:55:58,525
Fleurette wrote a blog about me.

858
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:00,027
There are few things I hate

859
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:02,613
more than petty ex-girlfriends.

860
00:56:03,488 --> 00:56:04,865
You wouldn't be telling
me any of this if you...

861
00:56:04,948 --> 00:56:07,367
If we ever planned on
letting you out? No.

862
00:56:08,952 --> 00:56:11,163
You'd be terminated
already if it was up to me.

863
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,207
First, the government has some
questions they want answered.

864
00:56:16,919 --> 00:56:19,838
Rex. Look who it is.

865
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,641
You be sure to keep
our guest in check.

866
00:56:30,724 --> 00:56:33,143
Little Joseph certainly
wouldn't want it any other way.

867
00:56:34,394 --> 00:56:36,605
I'll be back tomorrow to
get the answers we need.

868
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:43,529
Hey, handsome.

869
00:56:47,366 --> 00:56:48,742
Come on over.

870
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:02,965
-Hi!
-Hey, Eve.

871
00:57:03,048 --> 00:57:04,299
Oh, sorry we had to meet here,

872
00:57:04,383 --> 00:57:06,510
but Lex is always
accessing traffic cameras,

873
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:07,386
so he knows where I am.

874
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:09,555
I really don't understand why
you stay in that relationship.

875
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:11,724
'Cause he made a point to tell
me about all his ex-girlfriends

876
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:13,684
he had imprisoned in
his pocket universe.

877
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:15,269
-What?
-Right?

878
00:57:15,352 --> 00:57:17,271
-How's your mom?
-My mom?

879
00:57:17,354 --> 00:57:18,397
Oh, I love her so much.

880
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,066
I think of her as my mom,
even more than my own mother.

881
00:57:21,149 --> 00:57:22,651
Oh, she feels the same way,

882
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:24,820
from the-the one time
that you guys met.

883
00:57:24,903 --> 00:57:26,280
-Yeah?
-So, hey. Okay.

884
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:28,073
-Yes. Yes.
-Eve?

885
00:57:28,156 --> 00:57:29,533
There seems to be some
sort of connection

886
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:31,785
between Boravia
and your boyfriend.

887
00:57:31,869 --> 00:57:33,029
-I'm not clear on what...
-Oh.

888
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:34,328
What's wrong?

889
00:57:34,663 --> 00:57:35,831
What's "oh"?

890
00:57:36,164 --> 00:57:38,417
I thought you wanted
to see me, Jimmy.

891
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,501
I do but, Eve,

892
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:42,546
how could I even really see you
with Lex still in the picture?

893
00:57:42,671 --> 00:57:44,423
You're just trying to get
information out of me.

894
00:57:44,506 --> 00:57:45,633
I swear to God, that's not it.

895
00:57:45,716 --> 00:57:47,843
I-I just know that if I could
get some real dirt on him,

896
00:57:47,926 --> 00:57:49,469
then maybe the
two of us could...

897
00:57:49,553 --> 00:57:51,013
Could be together again?

898
00:57:56,852 --> 00:57:57,853
Yeah.

899
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:00,772
But you said my toes look like

900
00:58:00,856 --> 00:58:02,441
someone spilled shrimp
cocktail on the floor.

901
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:04,651
You have unconventional
toes. Who cares?

902
00:58:04,735 --> 00:58:05,861
There's other parts of
you that people would

903
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:07,654
find very attractive.

904
00:58:07,738 --> 00:58:09,489
Lex tortured a
dog the other day.

905
00:58:10,157 --> 00:58:12,201
-Jesus Christ!
-I know.

906
00:58:12,284 --> 00:58:13,952
-I have to go.
-Eve.

907
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,371
Please see what
you can find out.

908
00:58:17,456 --> 00:58:19,791
-Okay.
-Yes! Yes!

909
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:22,211
Okay.

910
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,215
I'm-I'm putting
'em in my pocket.

911
00:58:26,298 --> 00:58:27,966
Okay.

912
00:58:37,976 --> 00:58:40,270
Joseph. He's your son?

913
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:41,355
Don't talk to me.

914
00:58:42,022 --> 00:58:42,814
Please.

915
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:48,278
I could fly over and
get him if you just...

916
00:58:48,362 --> 00:58:49,363
If you'd stop with
the Kryptonite.

917
00:58:49,446 --> 00:58:51,615
There's no way out of
here, okay? So, just…

918
00:58:51,698 --> 00:58:53,617
-There's always a way.
-I said don't talk to me!

919
00:58:55,077 --> 00:58:56,077
I told you.

920
00:58:58,038 --> 00:58:59,498
Don't talk to me!

921
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:10,885
Yeah, so what do
you want me to do?

922
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:11,969
Where's the creamer?

923
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:13,887
On the counter,
where it always is.

924
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:16,974
He's in your group,
right? The, um, uh...

925
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:18,976
-What's it called, again?
-The Justice Gang.

926
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:20,561
-No.
-We're not called that.

927
00:59:20,644 --> 00:59:22,062
Yeah, your name is Mr. Terrific.

928
00:59:22,145 --> 00:59:23,689
You don't get a vote
with a name like that.

929
00:59:23,772 --> 00:59:25,649
I also voted against it.

930
00:59:25,732 --> 00:59:28,735
Yes. And as leader,
I get tiebreaker.

931
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:30,779
No, Superman is not
officially a member.

932
00:59:30,904 --> 00:59:31,530
Because you don't
want him to vote.

933
00:59:31,613 --> 00:59:32,615
You know which
way that would go.

934
00:59:32,698 --> 00:59:33,907
Shut up. He's kidding.

935
00:59:33,991 --> 00:59:37,035
So, how do you even
know Superman anyway?

936
00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:40,080
I… just… do.

937
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:41,748
So you know about
the hypno-glasses?

938
00:59:41,832 --> 00:59:42,958
Now she does.

939
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:46,420
I'm not saying who he is, just
that he wears hypno-glasses.

940
00:59:46,545 --> 00:59:47,379
They make his face…

941
00:59:47,462 --> 00:59:48,506
Terrific, how do they work?

942
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:50,048
They make his face
look different

943
00:59:50,132 --> 00:59:51,633
in your brain when
he wears them.

944
00:59:51,717 --> 00:59:52,718
So that you don't
know who he is.

945
00:59:52,801 --> 00:59:54,511
Yes, I know this, first of all.

946
00:59:54,595 --> 00:59:56,472
But, second of all, you really
shouldn't be telling me this

947
00:59:56,555 --> 00:59:58,974
in case I don't know who he is.

948
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:00,309
So, you know he's Clark Kent?

949
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:03,270
Oh, my God. Why does
he trust everyone?

950
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:06,982
He doesn't. Just us because
we are also of the cloth.

951
01:00:08,275 --> 01:00:09,401
"Of the cloth?"

952
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:14,114
-What are we gonna do?
-About what?

953
01:00:14,406 --> 01:00:17,201
Superman! He's your friend!

954
01:00:17,284 --> 01:00:19,536
Some friend. Came
here to rule over me?

955
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,288
It would be difficult
to find him.

956
01:00:21,872 --> 01:00:25,667
I put nanobot GPS trackers
into Superman's bloodstream.

957
01:00:25,751 --> 01:00:27,336
You can see where his trail ends

958
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:29,004
abruptly right here
at Fort Kramer,

959
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:31,965
a dormant military post across
the river about ten miles down.

960
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:34,676
Even if he was dead, those
trackers would still be there.

961
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,386
So, all this leads
me to believe,

962
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:37,721
as your article surmised,

963
01:00:37,804 --> 01:00:39,056
he really is in a
pocket universe.

964
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:43,477
You put nanobot GPS trackers
in your friend's bloodstream?

965
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:45,020
Oh, I do that to everybody.

966
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:48,148
So, okay. Come on. Let's
go to Fort Kramer then.

967
01:00:48,232 --> 01:00:49,942
The four of us, and find
out what's going on.

968
01:00:50,025 --> 01:00:52,027
And then do what?

969
01:00:52,653 --> 01:00:54,238
Save him.

970
01:00:54,738 --> 01:00:56,031
You wanna break a federally

971
01:00:56,114 --> 01:00:57,991
incarcerated
prisoner out of jail?

972
01:00:58,075 --> 01:00:59,660
Look, I think this is being done

973
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:01,912
to keep him from interfering
with the Boravian invasion.

974
01:01:01,995 --> 01:01:04,414
No, you look. I'm a
Green Lantern, lady.

975
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:07,000
That means I took a vow not
to get involved in politics.

976
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:08,252
Oh, that's part of the vows?

977
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:09,962
It's implied. Yeah.

978
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:11,213
An implied vow?

979
01:01:11,296 --> 01:01:12,631
Every time there's something
he doesn't want to do,

980
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:13,716
he says it's part of some vow.

981
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:14,842
Oh, I swear to God.

982
01:01:14,925 --> 01:01:17,261
I am two seconds away from
forming a giant hammer,

983
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:18,595
and beating you both to death.

984
01:01:19,638 --> 01:01:21,682
Is Supes here to
take over the world?

985
01:01:21,765 --> 01:01:23,100
I don't know. Probably not.

986
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:25,018
But the risk is just
not worth the beef

987
01:01:25,102 --> 01:01:27,229
between the US government
and the Justice Gang.

988
01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:29,189
Not our name. Makes
us sound like cowboys.

989
01:01:29,273 --> 01:01:31,191
But I agree with the rest.

990
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:33,861
So you're just gonna
let your friend rot

991
01:01:33,944 --> 01:01:35,737
in a pocket universe?

992
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:51,170
That haircut should
be against your vows.

993
01:01:51,295 --> 01:01:52,421
That what?

994
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:54,965
That what should be what?

995
01:01:55,048 --> 01:01:58,886
I'll have you know 348
chicks say otherwise.

996
01:02:04,766 --> 01:02:05,766
Hey!

997
01:02:08,604 --> 01:02:09,271
What?

998
01:02:09,646 --> 01:02:11,481
I'm not saying we're
gonna save him, but…

999
01:02:12,524 --> 01:02:14,276
…I think we can at least
check out what's going on

1000
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:16,236
with your boyfriend
at this Fort Kramer.

1001
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:17,320
He's not...

1002
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:19,573
We're just seeing each other.

1003
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:21,532
But thanks.

1004
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:22,910
You want me to drive?

1005
01:02:25,078 --> 01:02:26,413
We'll take my ride.

1006
01:02:46,934 --> 01:02:48,227
You have a flying saucer,

1007
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:50,437
but you couldn't get
a faster garage door?

1008
01:02:51,313 --> 01:02:52,689
I haven't worked on that yet.

1009
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:57,194
I'm not even sure
how I feel. Honestly.

1010
01:02:57,694 --> 01:03:00,113
-What?
-About Clark.

1011
01:03:00,572 --> 01:03:01,990
He's not my boyfriend.

1012
01:03:02,074 --> 01:03:03,242
We've actually just
been seeing each other…

1013
01:03:03,325 --> 01:03:05,453
-Yeah, lady, just to be clear,
-…for a couple of months...

1014
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:06,995
I'm not into people's emotions.

1015
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,664
Yeah, no, totally.

1016
01:03:09,164 --> 01:03:10,374
I'm just thinking out loud.

1017
01:03:10,999 --> 01:03:12,626
I was gonna break up
with him, actually.

1018
01:03:12,709 --> 01:03:14,378
I mean, we had this huge fight,

1019
01:03:14,503 --> 01:03:17,005
and he told me he loved
me, and it just didn't…

1020
01:03:26,056 --> 01:03:28,433
Q&A time, alien.

1021
01:03:32,479 --> 01:03:34,314
Today we have a special guest.

1022
01:03:34,398 --> 01:03:37,526
I'm familiar with him.

1023
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:43,365
And the smell of his piss as
we flew across the desert.

1024
01:03:43,448 --> 01:03:44,783
That is a lie!

1025
01:03:44,867 --> 01:03:47,411
No, not Vasil. He's just
here as an observer.

1026
01:03:50,247 --> 01:03:52,040
Mali.

1027
01:03:52,165 --> 01:03:56,420
Now, the US government has
a few questions for you.

1028
01:03:56,545 --> 01:03:59,673
Luthor, I barely know him.
He gave me food one time.

1029
01:04:01,008 --> 01:04:03,010
Who are you working
with here on Earth?

1030
01:04:04,094 --> 01:04:05,679
I'm not working
with anyone, Luthor.

1031
01:04:05,762 --> 01:04:07,181
Don't tell him
nothing, Superman.

1032
01:04:07,264 --> 01:04:08,473
I have no family or nothing.

1033
01:04:08,557 --> 01:04:09,558
Luthor, don't do this.

1034
01:04:09,641 --> 01:04:11,477
You eating my food was
a great honor, Superman.

1035
01:04:12,561 --> 01:04:13,729
-Ooh.
-No.

1036
01:04:13,812 --> 01:04:15,481
-Got lucky on that one.
-No, please.

1037
01:04:17,107 --> 01:04:18,817
No, Luthor, don't
do this. Please.

1038
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:20,944
Let's try another question,
shall we, Superman?

1039
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:23,530
-Luthor, don't do this.
-Who raised you as a child?

1040
01:04:23,614 --> 01:04:25,240
-I can't.
-I believe in you, Superman!

1041
01:04:25,324 --> 01:04:26,491
-No!
-Don't tell him...

1042
01:04:37,294 --> 01:04:38,962
I didn't imagine that
would go so quickly.

1043
01:04:39,463 --> 01:04:42,674
I'm sorry, it's…

1044
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:46,970
Mr. Handsome.

1045
01:04:48,847 --> 01:04:50,683
I'll be back later with someone
else you've chatted with,

1046
01:04:50,766 --> 01:04:51,892
and I'll kill them too.

1047
01:04:52,768 --> 01:04:55,479
Maybe that reporter you
always do interviews with.

1048
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:58,482
Maybe I'll kill Clark Kent next.

1049

Hey! You see this guy?

1060
01:05:51,118 --> 01:05:52,744
Unbelievable.

1061
01:05:52,828 --> 01:05:53,996

Unbelievable.

1094
01:07:31,093 --> 01:07:33,095
That jackass did create
a pocket universe.

1095
01:07:33,887 --> 01:07:35,514
And that's… bad?

1096
01:07:36,473 --> 01:07:39,893
When creating a pocket universe,
if you are just one picometer off,

1097
01:07:39,977 --> 01:07:42,896
you will have a black hole
where Earth used to be.

1098
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:45,023
And every time
you enter or exit,

1099
01:07:45,107 --> 01:07:47,192
you risk tearing a hole
in the fabric of reality.

1100
01:07:47,901 --> 01:07:49,236
You're kidding.

1101
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:50,362
It's the type of
reckless science

1102
01:07:50,445 --> 01:07:52,406
Lex Luthor specializes in.

1103
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:53,615
What are they doing?

1104
01:07:54,241 --> 01:07:55,841
They're trying to hack it.

1105
01:07:56,243 --> 01:07:57,953
So, I guess you decided to help.

1106
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:01,582
Only because it'll
piss off Green Lantern.

1107
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:05,042
Thanks.

1108
01:08:12,593 --> 01:08:14,428
He just killed that poor guy.

1109
01:08:15,429 --> 01:08:18,348
Mali. His name was Mali.

1110
01:08:18,849 --> 01:08:21,768
And I didn't… I... I didn't…

1111
01:08:22,895 --> 01:08:24,520
I didn't do anything.

1112
01:08:30,068 --> 01:08:31,694
You said you can get
to my son, right?

1113
01:08:56,929 --> 01:09:01,308
Ooh.

1114
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:11,568
Why are you still gross-looking?

1115
01:09:11,652 --> 01:09:13,737
I don't know.

1116
01:09:14,654 --> 01:09:15,738
I thought that…

1117
01:09:17,115 --> 01:09:18,617
It must be the sun.

1118
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,328
What are you... What
sun? There's no sun here.

1119
01:09:21,411 --> 01:09:23,247
That's the problem.
I need to heal.

1120
01:09:23,997 --> 01:09:26,416
I get my powers
from the yellow sun.

1121
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,710
Just… give me a second.

1122
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:34,131
Come on!

1123
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:40,180
Hell, yeah. We're in.

1124
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:02,077
Whoa! An anti proton river.

1125
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:08,876
-Do we rappel?
-Rappel?

1126
01:10:09,585 --> 01:10:11,003
Where am I gonna get
the gear to rappel

1127
01:10:11,086 --> 01:10:12,462
into a pocket universe?

1128
01:10:12,546 --> 01:10:14,048
I don't know. Maybe
it comes out of your…

1129
01:10:14,131 --> 01:10:15,424
Circles or something.

1130
01:10:15,549 --> 01:10:16,633
-Circles?
-What?

1131
01:10:16,717 --> 01:10:18,177
-T-spheres.
-Okay.

1132
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:19,980
They're three-dimensional.
Circles are flat.

1133
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:21,470
Sorry.

1134
01:10:22,014 --> 01:10:24,808
Unbelievable.

1135
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:27,686
This place is filthy
with black hole vortexes,

1136
01:10:27,769 --> 01:10:30,230
and that anti proton river
will tear us apart in seconds.

1137
01:10:30,564 --> 01:10:32,316
We cannot go in ourselves.

1138
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:34,693
Copy.

1139
01:10:35,402 --> 01:10:36,820
I can't make a sun.

1140
01:10:37,654 --> 01:10:38,488
I know.

1141
01:10:38,614 --> 01:10:41,408
I can only make something
kind of like a sun.

1142
01:10:41,909 --> 01:10:43,744
-What?
-All right.

1143
01:10:44,703 --> 01:10:45,537
Okay.

1144
01:10:45,621 --> 01:10:48,957
Okay, we got hydrogen,
and deuterium.

1145
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:51,043
And we got helium.

1146
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:52,920
-And compression, obviously.
-What are you doing?

1147
01:10:53,003 --> 01:10:54,880
Hey! Hey, no, no. Stop!

1148
01:10:55,464 --> 01:10:57,258
Enough! You're, you're gonna
get all of us in trouble!

1149
01:10:57,341 --> 01:10:59,218
Hey, bro, what are
you doing? Stop that!

1150
01:10:59,301 --> 01:11:00,719
He's doing something in here!

1151
01:11:00,802 --> 01:11:03,305
Guards! Guards! He's
doing something!

1152
01:11:03,388 --> 01:11:05,141
No, you are not going
to take credit for this.

1153
01:11:05,224 --> 01:11:06,350
I am the one that saw it first.

1154
01:11:06,433 --> 01:11:07,601
Oh, take a hike, Barbie!

1155
01:11:07,684 --> 01:11:08,936
-I'm getting the credit for it!
-Barbie?

1156
01:11:09,019 --> 01:11:10,312
These two are gonna
get us killed!

1157
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:11,480
Guards! Guards!

1158
01:11:11,563 --> 01:11:14,274
-Raptors! Raptors!
-In here! Guards! Guards!

1159
01:11:14,358 --> 01:11:16,443
I'm seeing something
that you'd all wanna see!

1160
01:11:55,899 --> 01:11:56,984
Joey!

1161
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:01,529
You have to take him.

1162
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:03,824
I can't carry him
when I change forms.

1163
01:12:13,542 --> 01:12:15,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No,
no, no! Krypto! Krypto!

1164
01:12:16,461 --> 01:12:18,130
Stop! Krypto! Krypto! Stop!

1165
01:12:18,213 --> 01:12:20,465
You're gonna squash
the baby. Stop!

1166
01:12:22,134 --> 01:12:24,011
What do you see?
Did you find him?

1167
01:12:24,469 --> 01:12:27,097
Oh, my God! What is that?

1168
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:28,807
Portal's been open too long.

1169
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:30,851
We can't stand here much longer.

1170
01:12:33,437 --> 01:12:35,105
Aw, you look like shit.

1171
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:36,481
I'm fine.

1172
01:12:36,565 --> 01:12:38,317
I think we need to get to
those portals up there.

1173
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,652
Uh, right. How do we…

1174
01:12:40,736 --> 01:12:41,862
…work them?

1175
01:12:41,945 --> 01:12:43,656
I don't know, but
we'll figure it out.

1176
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:44,739
Yeah.

1177
01:12:47,117 --> 01:12:48,117
Joey!

1178
01:13:11,141 --> 01:13:12,351
Kill him! He's still weak!

1179
01:13:21,109 --> 01:13:24,363
All right, freak. Nice and
slow. Back in the cage.

1180
01:13:25,739 --> 01:13:27,533
What are you gonna
do, splash us?

1181
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:31,453
Yes. With fluoroantimonic acid.

1182
01:13:55,811 --> 01:13:57,271
Do you have him?

1183
01:13:58,021 --> 01:13:59,982
-Hot damn.
-What?

1184
01:14:00,524 --> 01:14:01,844
It's a flying dog.

1185
01:14:04,361 --> 01:14:05,779
-Uh-oh.
-What?

1186
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:09,032
Come on, come on!

1187
01:14:10,242 --> 01:14:11,285
No, no, no! No!

1188
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:35,267
Black hole!

1189
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,109
Oh, boy!

1190
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:47,362
Krypto! Come here, boy!

1191
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:48,906
I can't get out of this!

1192
01:14:49,406 --> 01:14:50,406
Krypto!

1193
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:52,618
It's a black hole! We'll
never get out of it!

1194
01:14:52,701 --> 01:14:53,701
Pull us out!

1195
01:14:54,578 --> 01:14:56,330
Krypto! Come!

1196
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:00,834
Stop it! Krypto! Help us out!

1197
01:15:01,376 --> 01:15:02,419
Bad boy!

1198
01:15:05,172 --> 01:15:06,172
Rex!

1199
01:15:07,341 --> 01:15:08,341
Joey!

1200
01:15:47,172 --> 01:15:49,633
Man, you are so weird.

1201
01:15:52,761 --> 01:15:54,972
-Do you have him?
-Them.

1202
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:56,390
Superman, a mean dog in a cape,

1203
01:15:56,473 --> 01:15:58,892
a weird baby, and
a squiggle man.

1204
01:15:59,685 --> 01:16:00,685
What?

1205
01:16:02,396 --> 01:16:04,690
-Terrific?
-Follow me!

1206
01:16:09,194 --> 01:16:11,738
Krypto! No! Leave it!

1207
01:16:28,213 --> 01:16:30,090
Are you kidding me?

1208
01:16:31,633 --> 01:16:33,594
Those things aren't cheap!

1209
01:16:38,932 --> 01:16:41,101
Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

1210
01:16:41,185 --> 01:16:43,020
Hey, buddy.

1211
01:16:45,606 --> 01:16:48,317
Hey. Hey.

1212
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:54,531
-You came to get me.
-Yeah.

1213
01:16:58,368 --> 01:17:01,496
There's more people… being
held prisoner in there.

1214
01:17:01,955 --> 01:17:02,998
We gotta go get 'em.

1215
01:17:03,081 --> 01:17:03,916
-Whoa.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1216
01:17:03,999 --> 01:17:07,169
Not through here, you can't.
Not with you like this.

1217
01:17:07,294 --> 01:17:09,414
Clark, what the...

1218
01:17:09,505 --> 01:17:10,631
It's Kryptonite poisoning.

1219
01:17:12,216 --> 01:17:14,134
He'll heal, but it'll
take a day or two.

1220
01:17:14,218 --> 01:17:16,845
Get him someplace
safe. Take the T-craft.

1221
01:17:17,221 --> 01:17:19,723
The controls are
easy and intuitive.

1222
01:17:19,806 --> 01:17:22,184
I need to stay back here and
make sure the portal is secure.

1223
01:17:38,325 --> 01:17:41,286
Okay… okay.

1224
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,914
Okay.

1225
01:17:45,332 --> 01:17:46,542
Okay.

1226
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:49,086
No. Dog? Dog, I
really need to...

1227
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:51,547
No. Dog, I really need you to...

1228
01:17:52,172 --> 01:17:53,841
Come on.

1229
01:17:55,259 --> 01:17:58,262
Okay. Intuitive.

1230
01:17:58,595 --> 01:18:00,138
Yeah. For sure.

1231
01:18:02,182 --> 01:18:03,182
Okay.

1232
01:18:03,475 --> 01:18:04,476
That's it.

1233
01:18:07,604 --> 01:18:09,606
Whoa!

1234
01:18:16,947 --> 01:18:18,031
Pick that up!

1235
01:18:21,243 --> 01:18:24,162
Eve! Get out of here, you idiot!

1236
01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:28,666
Go!

1237
01:18:29,168 --> 01:18:30,210
Move!

1238
01:18:31,378 --> 01:18:34,548
How the hell could he
have gotten free? Hmm?

1239
01:18:37,551 --> 01:18:39,303
We need to find him.

1240
01:18:45,267 --> 01:18:45,976
Eve?

1241
01:18:46,059 --> 01:18:48,729
Oh, I'm so done, Jimmy.

1242
01:18:48,812 --> 01:18:50,063
Oh, um…

1243
01:18:50,147 --> 01:18:53,066
I have everything you
need to ruin Lex forever.

1244
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,193
What? Where?

1245
01:18:54,276 --> 01:18:56,111
Oh, I have it right here.

1246
01:18:59,114 --> 01:19:01,658
How dare he throw
a pencil at me?

1247
01:19:02,784 --> 01:19:05,871
He's gonna regret harming
me for the rest of his life.

1248
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:08,332
Such a jerk.

1249
01:19:14,963 --> 01:19:16,163
But if I send you this, Jimmy…

1250
01:19:17,174 --> 01:19:18,717
Uh-huh.

1251
01:19:21,136 --> 01:19:24,139
You have to promise me we
get to hang this weekend.

1252
01:19:24,598 --> 01:19:26,683
Just the two of us.

1253
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:32,022
Uh…

1254
01:19:35,317 --> 01:19:37,611
-Okay.
-Yeah? Okay! Yay!

1255
01:19:38,737 --> 01:19:42,032
Uh-huh. How, uh… How long?

1256
01:19:43,116 --> 01:19:45,285
-All weekend.
-All weekend?

1257
01:19:45,661 --> 01:19:46,870
Oh, my God, Jimmy!

1258
01:19:46,954 --> 01:19:49,414
I'm sorry this is such a
major imposition on your life!

1259
01:19:49,748 --> 01:19:52,042
No, it's not an imposition, I...

1260
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:53,710
I can tell you don't
really think so.

1261
01:19:56,296 --> 01:19:58,632
-No, no, no, no, no...
-Eve?

1262
01:20:10,811 --> 01:20:12,855
Come on, Eve.

1263
01:20:27,786 --> 01:20:29,997
I'm... I'm Martha. This is Jon.

1264
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:33,000
-I'm Lois. Hi.
-Lois.

1265
01:20:40,382 --> 01:20:41,382
Here, Son.

1266
01:20:42,801 --> 01:20:43,802
Hi, Ma.

1267
01:20:44,553 --> 01:20:46,597
Ma, they sent me here
to rule over everyone.

1268
01:20:47,431 --> 01:20:48,711
They sent me here
to kill people.

1269
01:20:49,099 --> 01:20:51,435
Clark, that ain't... that ain't…

1270
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:19,755
Is our boy gonna be okay?

1271
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:23,467
Yes. Mr. Terrific says yes.

1272
01:21:25,636 --> 01:21:27,554
Don't mind him, Lois.

1273
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:30,390
He's just a big ol' mush.

1274
01:21:30,474 --> 01:21:33,101
Especially when
it comes to Clark.

1275
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:51,662
This girl is
obsessed with you?

1276
01:21:51,745 --> 01:21:52,746
Uh-huh.

1277
01:21:53,455 --> 01:21:54,873
How do you do it, Jimmy?

1278
01:21:54,957 --> 01:21:56,208
Look, I didn't even
want to bother you,

1279
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:58,043
but you told me to call
with anything I got, so I...

1280
01:21:58,126 --> 01:22:00,407
Yeah, but I thought you said
she disappeared off the line.

1281
01:22:00,504 --> 01:22:02,423
I don't know. She might have
dropped her phone in the toilet.

1282
01:22:02,506 --> 01:22:04,341
She does that a lot.

1283
01:22:04,424 --> 01:22:07,845
Well, I'm not really sure
that sexy selfies are...

1284
01:22:19,648 --> 01:22:21,483
Your hot ex is a genius.

1285
01:22:21,942 --> 01:22:23,694
-Hot?
-We have to talk to Perry.

1286
01:22:23,777 --> 01:22:25,529
I'll be there as
soon as I can, okay?

1287
01:22:28,198 --> 01:22:31,326
Sending sexy selfies behind
the back of Lex Luthor?

1288
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:33,829
She has to be the biggest
idiot in the world.

1289
01:22:34,371 --> 01:22:36,915
Lex, he just told you,
the portal was destroyed!

1290
01:22:36,999 --> 01:22:38,292
The dimensional
aperture is still there…

1291
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:39,084
Syd, tell him!

1292
01:22:39,168 --> 01:22:40,252
…which we can open
remotely, so open it.

1293
01:22:40,335 --> 01:22:42,129
It is not… safe!

1294
01:22:42,212 --> 01:22:43,839
We can close the aperture later

1295
01:22:43,922 --> 01:22:45,591
by inputting the
coordinates, correct?

1296
01:22:45,674 --> 01:22:47,176
-Theoretically.
-Great!

1297
01:22:48,844 --> 01:22:52,055
If we can't find him,
we'll need to draw him out.

1298
01:23:11,909 --> 01:23:13,452
But Lex, that could tear

1299
01:23:13,535 --> 01:23:16,079
a dimensional rift into
the surrounding area!

1300
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:18,165
This is something you
think I don't know?

1301
01:23:22,211 --> 01:23:25,422
-That shouldn't happen.
-Oh, you don't say!

1302
01:23:25,964 --> 01:23:29,801
-Can you… Can you stop it?
-Can I stop it?

1303
01:23:35,807 --> 01:23:39,978
This is why you don't create
a damn pocket universe.

1304
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:42,898
There. Superman won't
be able to ignore that.

1305
01:23:45,192 --> 01:23:47,069
Now we know where he'll be next.

1306
01:24:29,027 --> 01:24:31,363
Thought you was out here.

1307
01:24:32,739 --> 01:24:33,739
Hey, Pa.

1308
01:24:34,616 --> 01:24:37,411
Never seen you
sleep that long.

1309
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:46,879
Last week me, Ma,
Hector and them,

1310
01:24:47,004 --> 01:24:50,299
we took a drive to
Beerki's Burritos

1311
01:24:50,424 --> 01:24:51,758
down in Luttus.

1312
01:24:52,801 --> 01:24:55,721
Like the one that used to be
out by that old, uh, blue barn,

1313
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:57,556
out on that I-9,
you remember that?

1314
01:24:58,682 --> 01:25:02,853
-Mm-hmm.
-Burritos still just as good.

1315
01:25:07,566 --> 01:25:10,068
That Louanne, she...
she seems nice.

1316
01:25:10,736 --> 01:25:12,988
-It's Lois.
-Hmm?

1317
01:25:13,363 --> 01:25:14,448
Her name's Lois.

1318
01:25:15,073 --> 01:25:16,783
But yeah, she's… she's nice.

1319
01:25:18,952 --> 01:25:21,163
But you don't seem
quite yourself.

1320
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:25,792
Yeah, well, that message
that my parents sent with me,

1321
01:25:25,876 --> 01:25:27,961
I had never heard the
second half before.

1322
01:25:28,795 --> 01:25:33,217
Well, I'd say what you
wanted that message to mean

1323
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,177
says a whole lot more about you

1324
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:38,305
than what anyone
meant for it to mean.

1325
01:25:38,388 --> 01:25:39,973
Pa, you don't understand.

1326
01:25:43,477 --> 01:25:45,479
I'm not who I thought I was.

1327
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:52,402
They sent me here
to hurt people.

1328
01:25:53,362 --> 01:25:55,405
Parents aren't for
telling their children

1329
01:25:55,489 --> 01:25:56,949
who they're supposed to be.

1330
01:25:58,492 --> 01:26:01,078
We are here to give y'all tools,

1331
01:26:01,161 --> 01:26:03,288
help you make
fools of yourselves

1332
01:26:03,372 --> 01:26:05,958
all on your own.

1333
01:26:11,338 --> 01:26:12,338
No.

1334
01:26:14,383 --> 01:26:17,594
Your choices, Clark.

1335
01:26:18,428 --> 01:26:20,305
Your actions.

1336
01:26:22,307 --> 01:26:26,436
That's what makes
you who you are.

1337
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:29,773
I'll tell you something, son.

1338
01:26:31,441 --> 01:26:32,860
I couldn't be…

1339
01:26:37,531 --> 01:26:39,867
…more proud of you.

1340
01:26:49,168 --> 01:26:50,419
Ol' mush.

1341
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:53,630
Clark, there's something on
the box you might wanna see.

1342
01:26:57,217 --> 01:26:58,594
And over in Eastern Europe,

1343
01:26:58,677 --> 01:27:00,429
Boravian troops
gather at the border,

1344
01:27:00,554 --> 01:27:02,014
seemingly mere minutes away

1345
01:27:02,097 --> 01:27:04,349
from invading
Jarhanpur once again.

1346
01:27:04,433 --> 01:27:06,268
Now, nearby
villagers are willing

1347
01:27:06,351 --> 01:27:07,728
and ready to defend
their country,

1348
01:27:07,811 --> 01:27:11,440
despite the exponentially
superior firepower

1349
01:27:11,523 --> 01:27:13,400
of the well-trained
Boravian military.

1350
01:27:28,457 --> 01:27:29,708
The villagers cling onto

1351
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:31,335
what little hope they have left,

1352
01:27:31,668 --> 01:27:33,629
as they're surrounded
by the military.

1353
01:27:34,004 --> 01:27:37,007
Boravian president, Vasil
Ghurkos, says the invasion

1354
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:38,675
is to protect the
Jarhanpurian people

1355
01:27:38,759 --> 01:27:40,135
from a tyrannical government.

1356
01:27:48,936 --> 01:27:51,813
Superman! Superman!

1357
01:27:51,897 --> 01:27:55,025
Superman! Superman!

1358
01:27:55,108 --> 01:27:57,277
Superman! Superman!

1359
01:27:57,361 --> 01:27:59,988
Superman! Superman!

1360
01:28:00,072 --> 01:28:02,324
Superman! Superman!

1361
01:28:02,407 --> 01:28:05,911
Superman! Superman! Superman!

1362
01:28:05,994 --> 01:28:10,123
Superman! Superman! Superman!

1363
01:28:12,501 --> 01:28:14,962
Without Superman here
to stop it this time,

1364
01:28:15,087 --> 01:28:17,881
the Jarhanpurians
don't have much hope.

1365
01:28:18,423 --> 01:28:21,260
I cleaned your boots.
I'll go get 'em for you.

1366
01:28:22,886 --> 01:28:23,887
Superman.

1367
01:28:23,971 --> 01:28:25,848
We need you here
in Metropolis now.

1368
01:28:25,931 --> 01:28:27,308
I have to get to
Boravia, Terrific.

1369
01:28:27,391 --> 01:28:29,643
There won't be a
Boravia, or a Metropolis,

1370
01:28:29,726 --> 01:28:31,895
or a Planet Earth, if
you don't get here soon.

1371
01:28:32,896 --> 01:28:34,565
This rift is about to
tear into the city.

1372
01:28:34,648 --> 01:28:37,359
I can't stop it.
I need your help.

1373
01:28:40,112 --> 01:28:41,905
All Metropolis citizens.

1374
01:28:41,989 --> 01:28:44,616
This is a mandatory evacuation.

1375
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:47,870
This evacuation
is not optional.

1376
01:28:49,663 --> 01:28:52,165
This is a mandatory evacuation.

1377
01:28:52,249 --> 01:28:56,086
This evacuation
is not optional.

1378
01:28:58,672 --> 01:29:01,216
This is a mandatory evacuation.

1379
01:29:08,348 --> 01:29:10,309
Yeah, I'm sure she's
scared, but find her.

1380
01:29:10,392 --> 01:29:11,727
Yeah, we're all equally scared.

1381
01:29:12,477 --> 01:29:14,062
Come on, just put her on.

1382
01:29:14,771 --> 01:29:17,065
Please, Juanita, can you
put Persephone on the phone?

1383
01:29:17,774 --> 01:29:20,402
Yes, she will care! Cats
know the sound of your voice!

1384
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:22,863
So, I was able to connect
with our contact at BodaBank.

1385
01:29:23,238 --> 01:29:24,657
Luthor's been selling
arms to Ghurkos

1386
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:26,950
for pennies on the
dollar for years.

1387
01:29:27,034 --> 01:29:29,453
-Why, you ask?
-I do ask why.

1388
01:29:29,912 --> 01:29:33,415
He did it in exchange
for half of Jarhanpur.

1389
01:29:33,498 --> 01:29:34,333
You're kidding.

1390
01:29:34,416 --> 01:29:36,710
At first, I thought Eve was
just sending me selfies.

1391
01:29:36,793 --> 01:29:38,795
But in the background
of the shots

1392
01:29:38,879 --> 01:29:40,547
are maps, contracts,

1393
01:29:40,631 --> 01:29:43,091
all kinds of documents
chronicling Boravia's agreement

1394
01:29:43,175 --> 01:29:44,927
to cede half of the
country to Lex Luthor

1395
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:46,720
once the invasion is complete.

1396
01:29:46,803 --> 01:29:48,180
He wants to make himself king.

1397
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:50,390
-King?
-King.

1398
01:29:50,849 --> 01:29:52,601
Should we really still
be standing here?

1399
01:29:53,352 --> 01:29:55,479
Lois, you got that flying
saucer deal up on the roof?

1400
01:29:55,562 --> 01:29:58,315
-Yup.
-Grant. Troupe.

1401
01:29:58,398 --> 01:29:59,859
-Come on.
-Grab the board, Jimmy.

1402
01:29:59,942 --> 01:30:02,861
-How many does it hold?
-Five, or six. Six.

1403
01:30:02,945 --> 01:30:06,365
-Okay. Lombard, you too.
-Oh, thank you.

1404
01:30:06,448 --> 01:30:08,700
Why the hell would Lex
want half a desert?

1405
01:30:08,784 --> 01:30:10,411
His cultish acolytes
believe he's gonna create

1406
01:30:10,494 --> 01:30:12,454
a technologically
advanced utopia.

1407
01:30:12,538 --> 01:30:13,288
Utopia?

1408
01:30:13,372 --> 01:30:14,457
There's a profit factor as well.

1409
01:30:14,540 --> 01:30:16,333
I mean, the petroleum
deposits alone

1410
01:30:16,416 --> 01:30:18,043
are worth multiples
of his investment.

1411
01:30:18,126 --> 01:30:19,406
Whatever his motives are,

1412
01:30:19,503 --> 01:30:20,796
we know Luthor did
everything he could

1413
01:30:20,879 --> 01:30:22,256
to ruin Superman's reputation.

1414
01:30:22,339 --> 01:30:23,340
Eve's photos show

1415
01:30:23,423 --> 01:30:25,759
he was behind the whole
Hammer of Boravia scam.

1416
01:30:25,843 --> 01:30:27,136
And all the bots stirring up

1417
01:30:27,219 --> 01:30:28,887
anti-Superman sentiment online.

1418
01:30:28,971 --> 01:30:31,807
Mr. Terrific believes
Luthor is also behind

1419
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:34,309
the spreading rift between
universes out there.

1420
01:30:34,393 --> 01:30:36,312
All of it seems to be geared
toward stopping Superman

1421
01:30:36,395 --> 01:30:38,635
from standing in the way of
the Boravian invasion, Chief.

1422
01:30:39,147 --> 01:30:41,984
Call me Perry, kid.
Post the story. Fast.

1423
01:30:47,823 --> 01:30:49,450
-Buckle up, kids.
-Why don't I have a seat?

1424
01:30:49,533 --> 01:30:51,410
-Jimmy, will you transcribe?
-Uh-huh.

1425
01:30:58,208 --> 01:30:59,918
Oh, God!

1426
01:31:04,464 --> 01:31:06,842
The Daily Planet has obtained
exclusive information

1427
01:31:06,925 --> 01:31:08,969
proving that billionaire
Lex Luthor is in league

1428
01:31:09,052 --> 01:31:11,305
with Boravian dictator,
Vasil Ghurkos.

1429
01:31:19,271 --> 01:31:20,814
Clark, are you close?

1430
01:31:20,898 --> 01:31:22,399
It's about to hit Metropolis,

1431
01:31:22,482 --> 01:31:23,984
and my codes are not
shutting it down.

1432
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:26,195
Shit!

1433
01:31:43,795 --> 01:31:44,795
Uh-oh.

1434
01:31:52,387 --> 01:31:55,182
Lex! The rift is almost here!

1435
01:31:55,265 --> 01:31:56,808
So slow it down.

1436
01:31:56,892 --> 01:31:58,561
I can't unless I can put
the code in to stop it.

1437
01:31:58,644 --> 01:31:59,978
Hold on a minute then.

1438
01:32:00,687 --> 01:32:03,148
-We gotta go, man!
-Otis!

1439
01:32:23,126 --> 01:32:25,462
Not sure where we're gonna
land when the world is gone.

1440
01:33:25,689 --> 01:33:26,732
There's a code to
close the rift,

1441
01:33:26,815 --> 01:33:28,442
but it's too
complicated to hack.

1442
01:33:28,734 --> 01:33:30,819
Luthor will have the
code at LuthorCorp.

1443
01:33:30,903 --> 01:33:32,863
Just give me a minute. I'll
get Krypto, and we'll go...

1444
01:33:32,946 --> 01:33:34,531
You brought that dog, man?

1445
01:33:34,615 --> 01:33:37,784
Yeah, I didn't... didn't want
him killing my parents' cows.

1446
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:58,680
Go on wide.

1447
01:33:58,764 --> 01:33:59,890
Wrong. Focus on The Engineer.

1448
01:33:59,973 --> 01:34:01,767
-I'm on the alien, Larry.
-7R.

1449
01:34:21,537 --> 01:34:22,830
It's not too late
for either of you.

1450
01:34:22,913 --> 01:34:23,664
5A!

1451
01:34:23,747 --> 01:34:25,123
You don't have to
do what Luthor...

1452
01:34:48,647 --> 01:34:50,107
2X!

1453
01:34:56,071 --> 01:34:57,823
Now, Angela, as planned,

1454
01:34:57,906 --> 01:35:00,450
fill his lungs and kill
the son of a bitch.

1455
01:35:42,701 --> 01:35:45,162
Can't he hold his
breath for over an hour?

1456
01:35:45,245 --> 01:35:47,039
Not without air in his lungs.

1457
01:35:47,122 --> 01:35:48,373
He'll be dead in minutes.

1458
01:35:48,457 --> 01:35:50,042
The nanites are suppressing
his optic nerve.

1459
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:52,336
Sight and X-ray vision
should be completely muted.

1460
01:35:52,461 --> 01:35:53,587
Lungs breached.

1461
01:35:59,551 --> 01:36:01,345
Da?

1462
01:36:04,806 --> 01:36:07,809
We will not sleep

1463
01:36:08,435 --> 01:36:11,897
until the street is flooded

1464
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:16,568
with the blood of
every Jarhanpurian!

1465
01:36:51,812 --> 01:36:53,230
What's his game?

1466
01:36:54,565 --> 01:36:56,692
Using friction to
get the nanites off?

1467
01:36:56,775 --> 01:36:58,360
Doesn't matter if he
gets them off his face.

1468
01:36:58,443 --> 01:37:00,070
The nanites are
still in his lungs.

1469
01:37:00,153 --> 01:37:01,989
Engineer, Ultraman, keep up.

1470
01:37:02,072 --> 01:37:03,699
We're trying.

1471
01:37:07,870 --> 01:37:09,788
-Maintain iOS.
-Yes. No shit, Larry.

1472
01:37:09,872 --> 01:37:10,872
Hurry.

1473
01:37:31,059 --> 01:37:32,311
He'll suffocate any minute.

1474
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:42,321
Engineer, envelop
him completely.

1475
01:38:08,972 --> 01:38:10,807
Wait! Wait, wait!
What is he doing?

1476
01:38:18,273 --> 01:38:21,735
I won't be able to sustain
the impact at this speed.

1477
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:26,615
No, Angela, unsheathe! He's
the only one protected!

1478
01:38:43,549 --> 01:38:47,511
Entering the hole.
Infrared, please?

1479
01:38:54,268 --> 01:38:55,853
Switch to night vision.

1480
01:38:59,773 --> 01:39:00,773
Whoa.

1481
01:39:28,385 --> 01:39:30,637
Her heart's still beating,
but she's unconscious.

1482
01:39:31,138 --> 01:39:32,139
Call in the Raptors.

1483
01:39:59,750 --> 01:40:01,502
What the hell?

1484
01:40:01,627 --> 01:40:05,506
That's right. Cloning you
was relatively simple.

1485
01:40:05,589 --> 01:40:08,300
All it took was combing the
aftermath of your battles…

1486
01:40:08,383 --> 01:40:10,261
…until I located a
strand of your hair.

1487
01:40:10,344 --> 01:40:13,013
That's how you got
into the Fortress.

1488
01:40:13,096 --> 01:40:14,264
You had my DNA.

1489
01:40:14,556 --> 01:40:17,476
Yes, but as is often
the case with cloning,

1490
01:40:17,559 --> 01:40:18,810
the match was imperfect.

1491
01:40:18,894 --> 01:40:23,315
He might be even stupider
than you. If that's possible.

1492
01:40:23,398 --> 01:40:24,733
But easier to control.

1493
01:40:24,816 --> 01:40:26,902
-3L.
-And stronger.

1494
01:40:28,237 --> 01:40:29,237
22K!

1495
01:40:32,115 --> 01:40:33,116
31D!

1496
01:40:34,076 --> 01:40:35,076
2A!

1497
01:40:36,078 --> 01:40:37,621
5B! 5B!

1498
01:40:38,497 --> 01:40:40,415
6K! 9A!

1499
01:40:42,125 --> 01:40:44,670
My brain will always win!

1500
01:40:44,795 --> 01:40:47,548
Brain beats brawn!

1501
01:41:39,308 --> 01:41:41,935
Superman. Superman.

1502
01:41:42,019 --> 01:41:44,646
Superman. Superman.

1503
01:41:50,110 --> 01:41:51,904
No matter what you
do to me, Luthor,

1504
01:41:53,071 --> 01:41:54,865
your plans in
Boravia won't work.

1505
01:41:54,948 --> 01:41:57,659
Oh, really? Why's that?

1506
01:41:58,035 --> 01:41:59,786
'Cause I called in some friends.

1507
01:42:00,370 --> 01:42:01,580
Mr. Luthor?

1508
01:42:02,915 --> 01:42:04,625
There is an anomaly
at the border.

1509
01:42:17,387 --> 01:42:18,555
Sorry, kid.

1510
01:42:19,097 --> 01:42:20,474
Superman couldn't make it.

1511
01:42:21,391 --> 01:42:22,893
So you got an upgrade.

1512
01:42:49,670 --> 01:42:52,670
Our forces aren't prepared to
deal with met a human anomalies.

1513
01:42:52,798 --> 01:42:54,424
I've sent the word to retreat.

1514
01:42:54,508 --> 01:42:55,676
Retreat?!

1515
01:42:55,926 --> 01:42:57,511
No! No! No!

1516
01:42:57,594 --> 01:42:59,137
We must get to the bunker!

1517
01:42:59,388 --> 01:43:00,222
The bunker!

1518
01:43:17,030 --> 01:43:18,866
I know you won't kill me.

1519
01:43:19,366 --> 01:43:23,495
You are too delicate
and weak, like Superman.

1520
01:43:23,579 --> 01:43:25,831
I'm not like Superman.

1521
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:35,674
-It's perfect. Post it, kid.
-On it.

1522
01:43:42,097 --> 01:43:43,932
I think you overestimate
the importance

1523
01:43:44,016 --> 01:43:46,476
of Jarhanpur to me, Superman.

1524
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:48,061
That was just a bonus.

1525
01:43:48,729 --> 01:43:50,147
I'm not killing you

1526
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:53,817
so the Boravian military
conflict can proceed.

1527
01:43:54,318 --> 01:43:58,488
I created the Boravian
military conflict

1528
01:43:58,572 --> 01:44:02,743
so I'd have an
excuse to kill you!

1529
01:44:03,118 --> 01:44:04,870
Once you involved yourself,

1530
01:44:04,953 --> 01:44:06,330
I knew I could easily get

1531
01:44:06,413 --> 01:44:08,373
our government's support
in nullifying you.

1532
01:44:08,957 --> 01:44:09,957
Why?

1533
01:44:10,375 --> 01:44:13,003
Because you're destroying us!

1534
01:44:13,128 --> 01:44:14,838
10Y. 13B.

1535
01:44:36,235 --> 01:44:37,819
You're driven by envy, Luthor.

1536
01:44:38,278 --> 01:44:42,032
-You couldn't be more obvious.
-No shit. I'm not dim.

1537
01:44:42,115 --> 01:44:45,244
I'm aware envy consumes
my every waking moment.

1538
01:44:45,327 --> 01:44:46,327
13L.

1539
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:52,501
I know when they mention
Galileo or Einstein

1540
01:44:52,626 --> 01:44:54,545
or one of these other twits
in the same breath as me,

1541
01:44:54,628 --> 01:44:57,297
I feel a tide of vomit
burn the back of my throat.

1542
01:44:57,381 --> 01:44:58,674
But at least Galileo
did something.

1543
01:44:58,757 --> 01:45:02,302
He wasn't some dopey Venusian
catapulted onto this planet,

1544
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:05,597
just to have the
world fawn over him,

1545
01:45:05,681 --> 01:45:10,477
because his strength illuminates
how weak we all really are.

1546
01:45:14,857 --> 01:45:18,110
So, my envy is a calling.

1547
01:45:18,193 --> 01:45:21,321
It is the sole
hope for humanity,

1548
01:45:21,405 --> 01:45:26,118
because it is what has driven
me to annihilating you.

1549
01:45:26,201 --> 01:45:27,202
1A!

1550
01:45:27,536 --> 01:45:29,913
1A! 1A!

1551
01:45:29,997 --> 01:45:33,208
1A! 1A! 1A! 1A!

1552
01:45:33,292 --> 01:45:34,292
Yes.

1553
01:45:43,343 --> 01:45:46,930
Oh, what are you
smirking at, you idiot?

1554
01:45:47,306 --> 01:45:51,268
Brain beats brawn.

1555
01:45:52,811 --> 01:45:53,812
Sorry, chum.

1556
01:46:10,579 --> 01:46:11,788
No, no, no! No!

1557
01:46:16,376 --> 01:46:19,546
You watch him through
those? Tell him what to do?

1558
01:46:27,554 --> 01:46:28,680
Krypto.

1559
01:46:30,182 --> 01:46:31,182
Get the toy.

1560
01:46:34,394 --> 01:46:36,897
Uh, thir-thirty-s...
Oh, the stupid dog!

1561
01:46:37,314 --> 01:46:38,607
-Uh…
-Charlie down!

1562
01:46:52,162 --> 01:46:54,081
-12C! Aah!
-Delta down.

1563
01:47:00,170 --> 01:47:01,171
36B...

1564
01:47:02,297 --> 01:47:03,298
-No.
-Hotel down!

1565
01:47:11,098 --> 01:47:12,683
-No!
-Bravo down.

1566
01:47:12,766 --> 01:47:14,518
-Bravo down!
-I just said that, Larry!

1567
01:47:29,950 --> 01:47:31,201
Alpha down!

1568
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:34,120
Lex.

1569
01:47:34,997 --> 01:47:36,623
The Raptors have arrived.

1570
01:47:42,129 --> 01:47:44,214
-Kill him!
-Good luck with that.

1571
01:48:49,196 --> 01:48:50,196
Hey!

1572
01:48:52,616 --> 01:48:55,786
This ain't playtime!
Quit messin' around!

1573
01:48:55,869 --> 01:48:57,829
We have to get to
Luthor to stop the rift.

1574
01:48:57,913 --> 01:48:59,081
I'm not messing around.

1575
01:48:59,164 --> 01:49:00,707
I'm doing important stuff.

1576
01:49:03,335 --> 01:49:05,337
It's gonna reach
Bakerline any minute.

1577
01:49:05,796 --> 01:49:07,130
There are people there.

1578
01:49:14,513 --> 01:49:16,015
-We have to go.
-We'll never make it in time.

1579
01:49:16,098 --> 01:49:17,818
-It's almost here.
-We have to try. Come on.

1580
01:49:21,728 --> 01:49:23,397
Lex!

1581
01:49:24,773 --> 01:49:26,066
I'm closing the freakin' rift.

1582
01:49:26,149 --> 01:49:28,777
No! They chose
him! Let them die!

1583
01:49:28,902 --> 01:49:30,821
-We'll close it from
the bunker -What?

1584
01:49:30,904 --> 01:49:32,573
…before it gets to
a city I care about.

1585
01:49:35,033 --> 01:49:36,285
Open the portal!

1586
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:43,000
Wrap it up. Let's go.

1587
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:45,294
Safety first, people.

1588
01:49:57,556 --> 01:50:00,267
Hey. Hey. The code to
close the rift is in here.

1589
01:50:01,101 --> 01:50:03,103
-I can help.
-I don't need your help.

1590
01:50:03,687 --> 01:50:05,606
I'm goddamn Mr. Terrific.

1591
01:50:06,815 --> 01:50:09,693
You piece of shit alien!

1592
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:13,488
That is where you've always
been wrong about me, Lex.

1593
01:50:14,573 --> 01:50:16,283
I'm as human as anyone.

1594
01:50:16,366 --> 01:50:18,994
I love, I… I get scared.

1595
01:50:19,077 --> 01:50:21,747
I wake up every morning, and
despite not knowing what to do,

1596
01:50:21,830 --> 01:50:23,540
I put one foot in
front of the other,

1597
01:50:23,624 --> 01:50:25,876
and I try to make the
best choices I can.

1598
01:50:25,959 --> 01:50:27,711
I screw up all the time.

1599
01:50:27,836 --> 01:50:29,713
But that is being human.

1600
01:50:31,006 --> 01:50:32,841
And that's my greatest strength.

1601
01:50:34,259 --> 01:50:38,305
And someday I hope, for
the sake of the world,

1602
01:50:38,388 --> 01:50:40,390
you understand that
it's yours too.

1603
01:50:40,474 --> 01:50:42,935
Oh, that's beautiful.

1604
01:50:43,018 --> 01:50:46,188
But none of this matters,
you patronizing clown.

1605
01:50:46,271 --> 01:50:49,983
The government gave me
the authority to kill you.

1606
01:50:50,067 --> 01:50:51,860
If not today, then tomor...

1607
01:50:51,944 --> 01:50:52,903
Ahh!

1608
01:50:57,991 --> 01:50:59,159
No, no, no!

1609
01:50:59,243 --> 01:51:01,620
Oh, my... Stop.
Krypto, put him down.

1610
01:51:04,414 --> 01:51:05,791
Krypto, drop him!

1611
01:51:05,874 --> 01:51:07,334
Krypto, drop him! Drop him!

1612
01:51:12,464 --> 01:51:14,216
Dude.

1613
01:51:19,888 --> 01:51:21,139
Got it.

1614
01:51:35,696 --> 01:51:37,447
Yes!

1615
01:51:46,498 --> 01:51:48,667
Mmm.

1616
01:51:49,418 --> 01:51:50,919
-Lex.
-What?

1617
01:51:51,712 --> 01:51:53,589
Well, this just in.
An absolute bombshell

1618
01:51:53,672 --> 01:51:55,007
from the Daily Planet.

1619
01:51:55,090 --> 01:51:57,259
Billionaire Lex Luthor
aligning himself

1620
01:51:57,342 --> 01:51:59,636
with a foreign entity,
believe it or not.

1621
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:01,054
Luthor has been giving them

1622
01:52:01,138 --> 01:52:03,640
billions and billions of
dollars' worth of free weapons...

1623
01:52:03,724 --> 01:52:06,727
Lex Luthor has been working
covertly with Vasil Ghurkos

1624
01:52:06,810 --> 01:52:08,145
and the Boravian government

1625
01:52:08,228 --> 01:52:10,981
to overthrow the
country of Jarhanpur.

1626
01:52:11,064 --> 01:52:12,691
Luthor has been
giving them billions…

1627
01:52:12,774 --> 01:52:14,985
We've had Luthor on
this show many times.

1628
01:52:15,694 --> 01:52:17,571
Little did we know,
he was a traitor.

1629
01:52:21,241 --> 01:52:22,201
Seems like the one thing

1630
01:52:22,284 --> 01:52:24,995
conservatives and liberals
can finally agree on

1631
01:52:25,078 --> 01:52:26,455
is that Lex Luthor sucks.

1632
01:52:26,872 --> 01:52:30,209
The whole world has
turned against Superman,

1633
01:52:30,292 --> 01:52:33,212
and we all owe him
an enormous apology.

1634
01:52:33,670 --> 01:52:37,758
He is, of course, the hero
we always thought he was.

1635
01:53:08,539 --> 01:53:11,124
Thank you! Thank you!

1636
01:53:16,713 --> 01:53:17,923
That was sick.

1637
01:53:18,632 --> 01:53:20,968
Guy, maybe he should
join the group.

1638
01:53:21,051 --> 01:53:22,553
Please.

1639
01:53:22,636 --> 01:53:25,347
I mean, no offense, but that
creepy mug is what you want

1640
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:27,349
representing the Justice Gang?

1641
01:53:27,432 --> 01:53:28,433
Justice Gang?

1642
01:53:29,309 --> 01:53:30,602
That's a cool name.

1643
01:53:31,645 --> 01:53:32,645
You're in.

1644
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:36,525
Come on!

1645
01:53:39,945 --> 01:53:40,946
Glad you're not concerned

1646
01:53:41,029 --> 01:53:42,281
about the met a humans, Rick.

1647
01:53:43,073 --> 01:53:45,284
'Cause now they're the
ones making the rules.

1648
01:53:57,379 --> 01:53:58,881
Everyone file. This way, please.

1649
01:53:58,964 --> 01:54:00,048
Easy!

1650
01:54:00,132 --> 01:54:02,968
-Fleurette!
-Mom!

1651
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:07,181
Oh!

1652
01:54:11,226 --> 01:54:13,228
Get his bald ass to Belle Reve.

1653
01:54:50,516 --> 01:54:53,227
Oh!

1654
01:54:54,770 --> 01:54:56,980
Now we can be together forever.

1655
01:55:04,488 --> 01:55:05,488
Miss Lane.

1656
01:55:06,907 --> 01:55:09,034
Oh, hi.

1657
01:55:09,535 --> 01:55:11,370
I thought I might
give you an interview.

1658
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:14,623
I could fill you in on all
of the behind-the-scenes.

1659
01:55:14,706 --> 01:55:15,706
Sure.

1660
01:55:16,458 --> 01:55:17,960
I think that would be…

1661
01:55:19,628 --> 01:55:20,628
Great.

1662
01:55:22,256 --> 01:55:23,423
Um…

1663
01:55:23,507 --> 01:55:24,550
How about over here?

1664
01:55:24,925 --> 01:55:25,926
For an interview.

1665
01:55:59,334 --> 01:56:00,334
Hey.

1666
01:56:03,589 --> 01:56:04,798
I love you, too.

1667
01:56:32,201 --> 01:56:33,660
How long have they
been hooking up?

1668
01:56:33,744 --> 01:56:34,995
About three months, I think.

1669
01:56:40,167 --> 01:56:42,336
Got this place cleaned
up pretty good.

1670
01:56:42,461 --> 01:56:44,421
Cleaned yourself up
pretty good, too.

1671
01:56:44,505 --> 01:56:46,298
-You think so?
-Yeah.

1672
01:56:46,381 --> 01:56:47,633
Think it gives you character.

1673
01:56:48,634 --> 01:56:50,469
Maybe one day you'll
give me a name.

1674
01:56:51,136 --> 01:56:53,430
Well. Four's a name.

1675
01:56:53,931 --> 01:56:55,182
So is Gary.

1676
01:56:58,435 --> 01:56:59,937
Aw, shoot.

1677
01:57:00,020 --> 01:57:02,064
Sir, I think your
cousin has returned.

1678
01:57:04,525 --> 01:57:08,362
-Yup.
-What the hell, dude?

1679
01:57:09,363 --> 01:57:10,989
Why did you move the door?

1680
01:57:11,073 --> 01:57:13,575
-I didn't move the door.
-Where is my dog?

1681
01:57:21,166 --> 01:57:23,585
Okay, well, this is why
he has behavioral issues.

1682
01:57:23,710 --> 01:57:25,003
No boundaries.

1683
01:57:28,465 --> 01:57:30,425
-It's not healthy, is it?
-Mm-mmm.

1684
01:57:39,893 --> 01:57:41,061
Come on.

1685
01:57:41,144 --> 01:57:43,272
Thanks for watching him, bitch.

1686
01:57:46,650 --> 01:57:49,152
She likes to go and
party on other planets.

1687
01:57:49,236 --> 01:57:51,280
-Planets with red suns.
-Oh.

1688
01:57:51,363 --> 01:57:52,656
Because of our metabolism,

1689
01:57:52,739 --> 01:57:55,200
we can't get drunk on a
planet with a yellow sun.

1690
01:57:55,284 --> 01:57:57,661
If I had any emotional
capacity whatsoever,

1691
01:57:57,744 --> 01:57:59,705
I'd be concerned
about her partying.

1692
01:57:59,997 --> 01:58:00,997
Yeah.

1693
01:58:01,081 --> 01:58:04,459
Superman, would you like to see
the footage of your parents?

1694
01:58:04,543 --> 01:58:07,004
-He finds it soothing.
-Oh!

1695
01:58:07,462 --> 01:58:09,298
Yeah, Gary, that'd be nice.

1696
01:58:16,346 --> 01:58:17,264
Everything you see,

1697
01:58:17,347 --> 01:58:18,682
you're seeing for
the first time.

1698
01:58:26,064 --> 01:58:27,524
All of this is for you.

1699
01:58:30,903 --> 01:58:31,903
Clark.

1700
01:58:42,164 --> 01:58:43,165
You did it!

1701
02:01:18,529 --> 02:01:20,030
One, two, three, four!

1702
02:02:26,680 --> 02:02:27,598
Whoo!

1703
02:08:30,878 --> 02:08:31,878
Hmm.

1704
02:08:33,213 --> 02:08:34,213
What?

1705
02:08:38,051 --> 02:08:39,051
Yeah?

1706
02:08:39,178 --> 02:08:41,180
It's just… a little off.

1707
02:08:41,263 --> 02:08:42,514
What do you want me to do?

1708
02:08:42,598 --> 02:08:44,475
Do you want me to take it
apart and put it back together?

1709
02:08:44,558 --> 02:08:46,059
No, no, no, no. I was just…

1710
02:08:47,936 --> 02:08:48,936
You just what?

1711
02:08:51,440 --> 02:08:53,400
Hey, man. I'm sorry. I
didn't mean to bum you out.

1712
02:08:55,235 --> 02:08:56,612
I shouldn't have brought it up.

1713
02:08:57,821 --> 02:09:00,449
Darn it, I can be
such a jerk sometimes.
