1
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:49,027
Open your eyes.

2
00:00:53,282 --> 00:00:55,951
This is where our magic comes from?

3
00:00:56,118 --> 00:00:57,202
Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:58,203 --> 00:01:03,125
This candle holds the miracle given to our family.

5
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:06,044
How did we get a miracle?

6
00:01:07,546 --> 00:01:09,214
Long ago,

7
00:01:10,382 --> 00:01:13,385
when my three babies had just been born,

8
00:01:15,637 --> 00:01:20,100
yourabuelo Pedro and I were forced to flee our home.

9
00:01:22,894 --> 00:01:25,731
And though many joined us,

10
00:01:25,814 --> 00:01:27,899
hoping to find a new home,

11
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:31,820
we could not escape the dangers

12
00:01:35,157 --> 00:01:38,952
and your abuelo was lost.

13
00:01:41,747 --> 00:01:44,625
But in our darkest moment,

14
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:48,629
we were given a miracle.

15
00:01:50,172 --> 00:01:54,009
The candle became a magical flame

16
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:55,802
that could never go out.

17
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,475
And it blessed us with a refuge in which to live.

18
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:06,563
A place of wonder.

19
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,440
Young mirabel: An encanto.

20
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:10,067
Abuela: An encanto.

21
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:14,321
The miracle grew.

22
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:18,784
And our house,

23
00:02:20,494 --> 00:02:22,788
our casita itself

24
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,084
came alive to shelter us.

25
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:33,215
When my children came of age,

26
00:02:33,382 --> 00:02:38,512
the miracle blessed each with a magic gift to help us.

27
00:02:41,056 --> 00:02:43,392
And when their children came of age...

28
00:02:43,558 --> 00:02:45,394
Young mirabel: They got magic, too.

29
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,354
Abuela: That's right!

30
00:02:47,562 --> 00:02:51,316
And together, our family's gifts

31
00:02:51,483 --> 00:02:55,862
have made our new home a paradise.

32
00:02:57,614 --> 00:03:04,204
Tonight, this candle will give you your gift, mi vida.

33
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:09,584
Strengthen our community, strengthen our home.

34
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:12,921
Make your family proud.

35
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,632
Make my family proud.

36
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:24,266
Yes, yes, casita, we're going!

37
00:03:30,313 --> 00:03:33,108
What do you think my gift will be?

38
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:36,903
You are a wonder, mirabel madrigal.

39
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:39,531
Whatever gift awaits

40
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:44,161
will be just as special as you.

41
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:16,568
Make your family proud.

42
00:04:17,068 --> 00:04:18,361
Morning, abuelo!

43
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:29,456
Hey! When's the magic gift happen?

44

My cousin's ceremony is tonight.

45
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,501
What's his gift?

46
00:04:32,584 --> 00:04:33,794
We're gonna find out!

47
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,045
What's your gift?

48
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:36,254
Who's asking?

49
00:04:36,338 --> 00:04:37,339
All: Us!

50
00:04:37,464 --> 00:04:39,841
Well, "us," I can't just talk about myself.

51
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:42,719
I'm only part of the amazing madrigals.

52
00:04:42,803 --> 00:04:44,387
Who's all the amazing madrigals?

00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:46,640
Ah, you're not gonna leave me alone, are you?

54
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:47,933
Casita, help me out.

Let's go!

59
00:04:54,022 --> 00:04:56,983
This is our home we've got every generation

60
00:04:57,067 --> 00:05:00,278
so full of music a rhythm of its own design

73

74
00:05:30,308 --> 00:05:31,434

75
00:05:31,518 --> 00:05:33,770

I can't remember all the gifts!

78
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:38,727
But I don't know who is who.

79
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:40,026
All right, all right, relax!

80
00:05:40,193 --> 00:05:41,820
It is physically impossible to relax!

81
00:05:41,903 --> 00:05:42,904
Tell us everything!

82
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:43,989

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,472
hey you can marry my sister if you wanna

171
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:40,057
between you and me she's kind of a prima Donna

172
00:08:40,081 --> 00:08:41,308
oh, I've said too much and thank you

173
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:42,500
but I really gotta go

174
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:44,169
-my family's amazing -mirabel

175
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:45,521
-and I'm in my family so -mirabel

176
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:46,546
well

177
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:48,629
- - Abuela: Mirabel!

178
00:08:49,716 --> 00:08:51,926
What are you doing?

179
00:08:52,427 --> 00:08:54,971
Uh, they were just asking about the family and...

180
00:08:55,055 --> 00:08:58,850
She was about to tell us about her super awesome gift!

181
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:01,603
Oh, mirabel didn't get one.

182
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:06,775
You didn't get a gift?

183
00:09:07,108 --> 00:09:10,028
- Um... - Mirabel! Delivery!

184
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:11,237
I gave you the special

185
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:13,615
since you're the only madrigal kid with no gift.

186
00:09:13,782 --> 00:09:16,743
I call it the "not special special"

187
00:09:16,826 --> 00:09:18,912
since, uh, you have no gift.

188
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:20,538
Thanks.

189
00:09:21,456 --> 00:09:23,166
Oh, and tell Antonio good luck.

190
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,585
The last gift ceremony was a bummer.

191
00:09:25,752 --> 00:09:27,170
Last one being yours

192
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:28,713
- that did not work. - Uh-huh.

193
00:09:28,838 --> 00:09:32,592
If I was you, I'd be really sad.

194
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:35,929
Well, my little friend, I am not.

195
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:38,723
Because the truth is, gift or no gift,

196
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,559
I am just as special as the rest of my family.

197
00:09:41,726 --> 00:09:43,186
Isabela: Who wants more pink?

198
00:09:43,353 --> 00:09:45,206
Luisa: All right, guys, where do I drop the wagon?

199
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,941
Maybe your gift is being in denial.

200
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:49,108
Pepa: I made a rainbow!

201
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:50,795
Woman: Get the chairs out of the way.

202
00:09:51,945 --> 00:09:53,488
Sorry. Excuse me.

203
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:55,466
Pepa: Dolores, can you hear if anyone is gonna be late?

204
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,491
Huh? Whoop!

205
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,244
Abuela: Lift it higher. Higher.

206
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:00,638
Camilo: Hey, nice job over there.

207
00:10:00,662 --> 00:10:03,039
- Jose: Yeah, yeah. - Camilo, we need another Jose!

208
00:10:03,206 --> 00:10:04,207
1 Jose!

209
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,585
Abuela: Luisa, the piano goes upstairs!

210
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:09,712
I'm on it! Careful, sis!

211
00:10:11,714 --> 00:10:12,817
Pepa: My baby's night has to be perfect,

212
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:15,260
and it's not perfect. And people are going to be coming.

213
00:10:15,343 --> 00:10:16,779
- And nothing's ready. - You're tornado-ing the flowers!

214
00:10:16,803 --> 00:10:17,846
The flowers!

215
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:21,432
Did someone say flowers?

216
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:22,976
- Man: Isabela! -

217
00:10:23,268 --> 00:10:25,562
Felix: Our angel, our angel!

218
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:27,522
Please don't clap.

219
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:30,191
- Thank you. - Oh, it's nothing.

220
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:33,278
A little sisterly advice,

221
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:34,755
if you weren't always trying too hard,

222
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:35,864
you wouldn't be in the way.

223
00:10:36,114 --> 00:10:39,033
Actually, isa, this is called helping.

224
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,494
And I'm not in the way. You are.

225
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:44,539
- - Whoa.

226
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:46,207
Excuse me.

227
00:10:46,374 --> 00:10:49,127
Mi vida, you okay? You don't have to overdo it.

228
00:10:49,294 --> 00:10:50,336
I know, mama'.

229
00:10:50,503 --> 00:10:53,548
I just wanna do my part like the rest of the family.

230
00:10:53,715 --> 00:10:54,966
- She's right, amor. - Eesh.

231
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,426
First gift ceremony since yours.

232
00:10:56,509 --> 00:10:57,594
A lot of emotions.

233
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,321
- Bee stings! - Agustin: And I've been there.

234
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:00,346
Ay, Agustin.

235
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,224
When me and your tio Felix married into the family,

236
00:11:03,683 --> 00:11:06,978
outsiders who had no gift, never, ever would...

237
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:10,815
Surrounded by the exceptional, it was easy to feel

238
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:12,108
UN-ceptional.

239
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:13,276
Okay, papi.

240
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:14,628
- I'm just saying, I get it. - Eat.

241
00:11:14,652 --> 00:11:16,362
Mi amor, if you ever wanna talk...

242
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:18,031
I gotta put out the stuff.

243
00:11:18,114 --> 00:11:20,074
The house isn't gonna decorate itself.

244
00:11:21,075 --> 00:11:22,827
Sorry, you could. You look great.

245
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:25,163
- Corazon, remember! - Yeah, remember!

246
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,224
- You have nothing to prove! - You have nothing to prove!

247
00:11:27,248 --> 00:11:28,249
Mirabel: Mm-hmm.

248
00:11:33,755 --> 00:11:35,256
Felix: Ah, iOS musicos.

249
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,633
You guys can set up over here.

250
00:11:36,716 --> 00:11:39,719
Abuela: Clean your rooms! I don't care how big they are.

251
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:42,735
Tiple maestro: Has anybody seen my tip/e?

252
00:11:46,684 --> 00:11:47,804
- Abuela: One hour! -

253
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,147
Oh! No, no, no!

254
00:11:51,314 --> 00:11:53,691
Maybe you should leave the decorations

255
00:11:53,775 --> 00:11:55,401
to someone else?

256
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:59,280
No, I actually made these as a surprise for you. Ooh!

257
00:11:59,781 --> 00:12:01,449
Ooh!

258
00:12:01,532 --> 00:12:04,619
Mirabel, I know you want to help.

259
00:12:04,786 --> 00:12:07,372
But tonight must go perfectly.

260
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:12,627
The whole town relies on our family, on our gifts.

261
00:12:12,752 --> 00:12:16,756
So, the best way for some of us to help

262
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:18,967
is to step aside.

263
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:22,512
Let the rest of the family do what they do best.

264
00:12:23,596 --> 00:12:24,597
Okay?

265
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:26,474
Mm-hmm.

266
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:30,895
- Pepa! You have a cloud! - I know, mama'.

267
00:12:31,062 --> 00:12:34,190
But now I can't find Antonio. What do you want from me?

268
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:38,611
Mama', be nice to mirabel, okay?

269
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:40,905
You know tonight will be hard for her.

270
00:12:41,572 --> 00:12:44,575
Abuela: If the gift ceremony doesn't go well this time,

271
00:12:44,742 --> 00:12:47,078
tonight will be hard for us all.

272
00:12:53,251 --> 00:12:54,377
Felix: Antonio!

273
00:13:03,469 --> 00:13:06,347
Everyone's looking for you.

274
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:11,769
This present will self-destruct

275
00:13:11,853 --> 00:13:12,895
if you don't take it

276
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:14,689
in three,

277
00:13:16,774 --> 00:13:19,485
one... oh.

278
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:26,075
Nervous?

279
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,204
You have nothing to worry about.

280
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:32,332
You're gonna get your gift and open that door

281
00:13:32,498 --> 00:13:35,835
and it's gonna be the coolest ever.

282
00:13:36,002 --> 00:13:37,503
I know it.

283
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:41,716
What if it doesn't work?

284
00:13:43,134 --> 00:13:46,846
Well, in that impossible scenario,

285
00:13:47,013 --> 00:13:50,892
you'd stay here in the nursery with me.

286
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:52,643
Forever.

287
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,104
And I'd get you all to myself.

288
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:59,400
I wish you could have a door.

289
00:14:02,153 --> 00:14:03,738
You know what?

290
00:14:03,905 --> 00:14:06,407
You don't have to worry about me,

291
00:14:06,574 --> 00:14:09,369
'cause I have an amazing family

292
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:11,913
and an amazing house.

293
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:14,665
And an amazing you.

294
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:20,046
And seeing you get your special gift and your door,

295
00:14:20,213 --> 00:14:23,674
that's gonna make me way more happy than anything.

296
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:26,844
But, alas,

297
00:14:26,928 --> 00:14:30,932
I am gonna miss having the world's best roomie.

298
00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:40,400
I know you're an animal guy

299
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:42,026
and I made this so,

300
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,362
when you move into your cool, new room,

301
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:46,989
you always have something to snuggle with.

302
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,002
All right, hombrecito, you ready?

303
00:15:01,546 --> 00:15:03,131
Sorry, I got to get one more squeeze.

304
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:06,467
Okay, okay, we're going!

305
00:15:06,676 --> 00:15:07,676
Mirabel: Ow! Ow!

306
00:15:08,678 --> 00:15:11,180
- - Kids: Gracias!

307
00:15:13,182 --> 00:15:14,618
Man: Party night

308
00:15:14,642 --> 00:15:16,519
e veryone's coming to celebrate

309
00:15:16,602 --> 00:15:18,271
party night

310
00:15:18,354 --> 00:15:20,440
e veryone's coming to have fun

311
00:15:20,523 --> 00:15:21,983

happy in my paradise

313
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,987
- here you go! - And revealing

314
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,448
miracles on every floor

315
00:15:31,075 --> 00:15:32,160
Enchantment

316
00:15:33,995 --> 00:15:34,996
Enchantment

317
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,910
Colombia, llove you so much

318
00:15:36,956 --> 00:15:39,208
- Cecilia, up top! -

319
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:42,253
I always fall in love with your enchantment

320
00:15:42,336 --> 00:15:43,671
whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh

321
00:15:43,754 --> 00:15:46,382
Colombia, llove you so much

322
00:15:46,466 --> 00:15:47,884
whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh

323
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,761
may you keep blessing your enchantment

324
00:15:50,845 --> 00:15:52,180
enchantment

325
00:15:52,263 --> 00:15:54,348
- - Enchantment

326
00:15:55,475 --> 00:15:57,560
- whoo! - Ah.

327
00:15:57,643 --> 00:15:58,912
Opening doors the morning is arriving

328
00:15:58,936 --> 00:16:00,480
- - They stay open

329
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:02,791
And the coffee is made at home

330
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,944
happy song so that good wins over bad

331
00:16:07,028 --> 00:16:08,738
don't wake me up

332
00:16:08,821 --> 00:16:10,865
this looks like a real dream

333
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:13,618
Colombia, llove you so much

334
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:14,785
whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh

335
00:16:14,869 --> 00:16:17,246
I always fall in love with your enchantment

336
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,581
whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh

337
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:20,267
- - Colombia, llove you so much

338
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,335
- both: Whoa! - Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh

339
00:16:22,502 --> 00:16:24,378
your charm continues to bless you

340
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:25,755
- whoa! - Whee!

341
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:28,799
Colombia, llove you so much

342
00:16:28,883 --> 00:16:30,635
whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh...

343
00:16:30,718 --> 00:16:32,887
There you are.

344
00:16:33,054 --> 00:16:35,473
Look at you! All grown up.

345
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,892
Pepi, amor, you're gonna get him all wet.

346
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:40,102
You are making your papa proud.

347
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:41,395
I don't sound like that.

348
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:42,873
I don't sound like that.

349
00:16:42,897 --> 00:16:44,774
Abuela says it's time.

350
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,610
We'll be waiting at your door.

351
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:49,153
Okay, okay. Vamo, vamo, vamo,

352
00:16:49,237 --> 00:16:50,714
Okay, okay. Vamo, vamo, vamo,

353
00:16:50,738 --> 00:16:52,258
All right, I'm done!

354
00:17:01,082 --> 00:17:03,292
Fifty years ago,

355
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:07,171
in our darkest moment,

356
00:17:08,047 --> 00:17:11,300
this candle blessed us with a miracle.

357
00:17:11,884 --> 00:17:14,428
And the greatest honour of our family

358
00:17:14,595 --> 00:17:16,931
has been to use our blessings

359
00:17:17,014 --> 00:17:20,560
to serve this beloved community.

360
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:24,480
Tonight, we come together once more

361
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:27,858
as another steps into the light

362
00:17:28,484 --> 00:17:30,486
to make us proud.

363
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:02,435
I can't.

364
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:06,147
I need you.

365
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,122
Come on, let's get you to your door.

366
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,983
Abuela: Will you use your gift to honour our miracle?

367
00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:35,903
Will you serve this community

368
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,447
and strengthen our home?

369
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:08,436
- -

370
00:20:09,687 --> 00:20:10,896
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

371
00:20:11,313 --> 00:20:12,857
I understand you.

372
00:20:15,818 --> 00:20:18,237
Of course they can come!

373
00:20:18,362 --> 00:20:21,866
- -

374
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:42,803
We have a new gift!

375
00:20:43,095 --> 00:20:46,015
- -

376
00:20:53,189 --> 00:20:55,733
- -

377
00:21:01,197 --> 00:21:03,783
It's bigger on the inside?

378
00:21:11,832 --> 00:21:13,375
Antonio!

379
00:21:16,337 --> 00:21:18,506
You wanna go where?

380
00:21:18,756 --> 00:21:20,174
Whoa!

381
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:28,098
- -

382
00:21:28,182 --> 00:21:30,935
- Whoa! -

383
00:21:43,155 --> 00:21:45,157
- -

384
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:47,827
- That was great! - Okay! All right!

385
00:21:49,078 --> 00:21:50,704
Felix: That was amazing.

386
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:54,667
I knew you could do it!

387
00:21:54,834 --> 00:21:58,838
A giftjust as special as you.

388
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:03,425
We need a picture!

389
00:22:03,592 --> 00:22:06,303
Everyone! Come, come, come!

390
00:22:06,846 --> 00:22:10,474
It's a great night! It's a perfect night!

391
00:22:12,184 --> 00:22:14,061
Everyone, together!

392
00:22:14,144 --> 00:22:17,231
- All: La familia madrigal! -

393
00:22:28,826 --> 00:22:32,204
Don't be upset or mad at all

394
00:22:34,415 --> 00:22:37,543
don't feel regret or sad at all

395
00:22:38,961 --> 00:22:42,798
hey, I'm still a part of the family madrigal

396
00:22:42,965 --> 00:22:46,719
and I'm fine I am totally fine

397
00:22:46,886 --> 00:22:51,015
I will stand on the side as you shine

398
00:22:52,224 --> 00:22:56,478
I'm not fine I'm not fine

399
00:22:56,729 --> 00:23:00,107
I can't move the mountains

400
00:23:00,274 --> 00:23:03,861
I can't make flowers bloom

401
00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:08,741
I can't take another night up in my room

402
00:23:08,908 --> 00:23:11,660
waiting on a miracle

403
00:23:11,827 --> 00:23:15,289
I can't heal what's broken

404
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:19,168
can't control the morning rain or a hurricane

405
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:23,756
can't keep down the unspoken invisible pain

406
00:23:23,923 --> 00:23:26,967
always waiting on a miracle a miracle

407
00:23:27,134 --> 00:23:30,763
always walking alone

408
00:23:31,055 --> 00:23:34,642
always wanting for more

409
00:23:34,808 --> 00:23:39,313
like I'm still at that door longing to shine

410
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,232
like all of you shine

411
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:45,903
all I need is a change

412
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,657
all I need is a chance

413
00:23:49,865 --> 00:23:54,495
all I know is I can't stay on the side

414
00:23:54,578 --> 00:23:56,372
open your eyes

415
00:23:56,538 --> 00:24:00,960
open your eyes open your eyes

416
00:24:01,168 --> 00:24:04,755
I would move the mountains

417
00:24:04,922 --> 00:24:08,759
make new trees and flowers grow

418
00:24:08,926 --> 00:24:13,013
someone please just let me know where do I go

419
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,058
I am waiting on a miracle a miracle

420
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:19,395
I would heal what's broken

421
00:24:19,895 --> 00:24:23,774
show this family something new

422
00:24:23,941 --> 00:24:28,070
who I am inside so what can I do?

423
00:24:28,278 --> 00:24:30,197
I'm sick of waiting on a miracle

424
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,281
so here I go

425
00:24:31,824 --> 00:24:35,244
I am ready come on, I'm ready

426
00:24:35,411 --> 00:24:39,289
I've been patient and steadfast and steady

427
00:24:39,456 --> 00:24:40,541
bless me now

428
00:24:40,624 --> 00:24:43,585
as you blessed us all those years ago

429
00:24:43,752 --> 00:24:47,965
when you gave us a miracle

430
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:54,680
am I too late for a miracle?

431
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,457
Casita?

432
00:26:17,971 --> 00:26:20,390
- -

433
00:26:27,147 --> 00:26:28,148
Pepa: Imueve/o!

434
00:26:28,232 --> 00:26:30,484
- Come on, abuela! -

435
00:26:33,153 --> 00:26:34,947
Mirabel: The house is in danger!

436
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,698
The house is in danger!

437
00:26:36,824 --> 00:26:38,826
- - The tiles were falling,

438
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:40,619
and there were cracks everywhere.

439
00:26:40,786 --> 00:26:42,496
And the candle almost went out.

440
00:26:45,124 --> 00:26:46,375
Show me.

441
00:26:50,045 --> 00:26:51,839
Mirabel: What?

442
00:26:53,632 --> 00:26:55,092
No, that's...

443
00:26:56,301 --> 00:26:58,137
The cracks were there.

444
00:26:59,221 --> 00:27:01,390
They were everywhere.

445
00:27:01,557 --> 00:27:03,142
The house was in trouble,

446
00:27:03,225 --> 00:27:05,227
- the candle was... -

447
00:27:05,811 --> 00:27:07,312
Abuela, I promise...

448
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:08,522
That's enough.

449
00:27:11,191 --> 00:27:14,194
There is nothing wrong with la casa madrigal.

450
00:27:14,361 --> 00:27:16,572
The magic is strong.

451
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,991
- And so are the drinks. -

452
00:27:19,241 --> 00:27:21,243
Please! Music!

453
00:27:21,326 --> 00:27:23,245
- A bailar! A bailar! - Psst.

454
00:27:25,873 --> 00:27:28,709
- -

455
00:27:35,883 --> 00:27:37,110
Mirabel: If it was all in my head,

456
00:27:37,134 --> 00:27:38,260
how did I cut my hand?

457
00:27:38,635 --> 00:27:41,013
I would never ruin Antonio's night.

458
00:27:41,471 --> 00:27:43,098
Is that really what you think?

459
00:27:43,265 --> 00:27:46,894
What I think is that today was very hard for you.

460
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,770
That's...

461
00:27:49,021 --> 00:27:51,523
I was looking out for the family.

462
00:27:51,732 --> 00:27:55,027
And I might not be super strong like luisa,

463
00:27:55,194 --> 00:27:58,530
or effortlessly perfect like sefiorita perfecta Isabela

464
00:27:58,697 --> 00:28:01,158
who's never even had a bad hair day, but...

465
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:03,702
Whatever.

466
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:12,377
I wish you could see yourself the way I do.

467
00:28:12,544 --> 00:28:16,131
You are perfectjust like this.

468
00:28:16,298 --> 00:28:20,385
You're just as special as anyone else in this family.

469
00:28:20,844 --> 00:28:22,137
Mm-hmm.

470
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:25,265
You just healed my hand with an arepa con queso.

471
00:28:25,432 --> 00:28:30,062
I healed your hand with my love for my daughter

472
00:28:30,229 --> 00:28:32,356
- with her wonderful brain... -

473
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:33,750
And big heart, cool glasses...

474
00:28:33,774 --> 00:28:34,858
Stop!

475
00:28:35,025 --> 00:28:36,109
Mama'!

476
00:28:37,486 --> 00:28:39,655
I know what I saw.

477
00:28:44,993 --> 00:28:47,621
Mira, my brother Bruno lost his way in this family.

478
00:28:49,498 --> 00:28:51,333
I don't want the same for you.

479
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,461
Get some sleep.

480
00:28:55,337 --> 00:28:57,256
You'll feel better tomorrow.

481
00:29:41,967 --> 00:29:44,177
Ay, Pedro.

482
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,055
I need you.

483
00:29:48,432 --> 00:29:50,517
Cracks in our casita.

484
00:29:52,477 --> 00:29:56,565
If our family knew how vulnerable we truly are...

485
00:29:58,191 --> 00:30:00,777
If our miracle is dying...

486
00:30:03,864 --> 00:30:07,367
We cannot lose our home again.

487
00:30:08,869 --> 00:30:11,955
Why is this happening?

488
00:30:14,124 --> 00:30:15,250
Open my eyes.

489
00:30:17,252 --> 00:30:21,506
If the answer is here, help me find it.

490
00:30:22,174 --> 00:30:25,260
Help me protect our family.

491
00:30:25,677 --> 00:30:29,556
Help me save our miracle.

492
00:30:39,024 --> 00:30:40,817
I will save the miracle.

493
00:30:48,825 --> 00:30:51,578
Wait. How do I save a miracle?

494
00:30:53,538 --> 00:30:56,666
I figure out what's happening to the miracle.

495
00:30:58,668 --> 00:31:00,253
Oh, I have no idea.

496
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:03,173
But there is one person in this family

497
00:31:03,256 --> 00:31:06,301
who hears everything about everything.

498
00:31:06,468 --> 00:31:08,678
So, if anyone would know what's wrong with the magic...

499
00:31:08,845 --> 00:31:10,389
- Hey! - Mirabel: It's her.

500
00:31:10,889 --> 00:31:11,765
Dolores, hey.

501
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:12,992
You know, out of all my older cousins,

502
00:31:13,016 --> 00:31:14,118
you're, like, my favourite cousin,

503
00:31:14,142 --> 00:31:15,578
so I feel like I can talk to you about anything,

504
00:31:15,602 --> 00:31:17,270
ergo you can talk to me about anything.

505
00:31:17,437 --> 00:31:19,117
Like the problem with the magic last night

506
00:31:19,189 --> 00:31:20,541
that no one seemed to worry about,

507
00:31:20,565 --> 00:31:22,901
but maybe you heard about that maybe I should know about.

508
00:31:23,068 --> 00:31:25,320
Camilo! Stop pretending you're Dolores

509
00:31:25,404 --> 00:31:26,488
so you can have seconds.

510
00:31:27,364 --> 00:31:30,117
Worth a shot. Ah!

511
00:31:31,535 --> 00:31:34,371
The only one worried about the magic is you

512
00:31:34,538 --> 00:31:36,456
and the rats talking in the walls.

513
00:31:36,873 --> 00:31:38,375
Oh, and luisa,

514
00:31:38,458 --> 00:31:41,628
I heard her eye twitching all night.

515
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,381
There we go.

516
00:31:44,548 --> 00:31:47,509
Everyone, to the table! Let's go, let's go.

517
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,559
- Luisa. - Abuela: Family.

518
00:31:55,976 --> 00:31:57,686
We are all thankful

519
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:02,190
for Antonio's wonderful new Gift.

520
00:32:02,357 --> 00:32:04,401
I told them to warm up your seat.

521
00:32:04,609 --> 00:32:06,528
Thank you, tofiito.

522
00:32:06,695 --> 00:32:08,196
I'm sure today we'll find a way

523
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,990
to put your blessings to good use.

524
00:32:10,157 --> 00:32:12,343
Luisa, Dolores says you're totally freaking out.

525
00:32:12,367 --> 00:32:13,594
Any chance you maybe know something

526
00:32:13,618 --> 00:32:14,887
about last night with the magic...

527
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:16,329
- You do! - Abuela: Mirabel!

528
00:32:16,955 --> 00:32:18,474
If you can't pay attention, I will help you.

529
00:32:18,498 --> 00:32:20,041
- Oh, actually... - Casita!

530
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,670
As I was saying,

531
00:32:24,504 --> 00:32:27,382
we must never take our miracle for granted,

532
00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:30,594
so today we will work twice as hard.

533
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,512
- Mm-hmm. I will help luisa. - Stop.

534
00:32:33,763 --> 00:32:36,308
First, an announcement.

535
00:32:36,475 --> 00:32:38,101
I've spoken to the guzmans

536
00:32:38,226 --> 00:32:40,979
about Mariano's proposal to Isabela.

537
00:32:41,146 --> 00:32:43,064
Dolores, do we have a date?

538
00:32:43,231 --> 00:32:45,400
Tonight. He wants five babies.

539
00:32:45,484 --> 00:32:47,277
- - Wonderful!

540
00:32:47,444 --> 00:32:51,072
Such a fine young man with our perfect Isabela

541
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:54,701
will bring a new generation of magical blessings

542
00:32:54,868 --> 00:32:57,579
and make both of our families stronger.

543
00:33:00,165 --> 00:33:03,251
Okay. Our community is counting on us.

544
00:33:03,418 --> 00:33:05,420
La familia madrigal!

545
00:33:05,587 --> 00:33:06,880
All: La familia madrigal!

546
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:08,048
La familia madrigal!

547
00:33:08,256 --> 00:33:09,799
Luisa, hey. What?

548
00:33:12,636 --> 00:33:15,055
- Sorry. - What is your problem?

549
00:33:15,222 --> 00:33:16,389
Mirabel: Hey! Luisa, hold up!

550
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,975
- -

551
00:33:22,354 --> 00:33:23,605
Senora ozma: Luisa, can you

552
00:33:23,688 --> 00:33:24,940
- re-route the river? - Will do.

553
00:33:25,106 --> 00:33:26,775
Luisa, the donkeys got out again.

554
00:33:26,858 --> 00:33:27,859
Luisa: On it.

555
00:33:32,989 --> 00:33:34,032
Luisa!

556
00:33:34,449 --> 00:33:36,159
Wait a second!

557
00:33:36,243 --> 00:33:37,603
You gotta tell me about the magic.

558
00:33:37,661 --> 00:33:39,412
What's going on? What are you hiding?

559
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:41,623
Nothing. Just got a lot of chores,

560
00:33:41,706 --> 00:33:43,333
so maybe you should just go home.

561
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,335
Luisa, my house is leaning to the...

562
00:33:45,627 --> 00:33:46,729
Dolores said your eye was twitching,

563
00:33:46,753 --> 00:33:47,837
and it never twitches.

564
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:49,297
Something's making you nervous.

565
00:33:49,464 --> 00:33:51,925
Hey, move. You're gonna make me drop a donkey.

566
00:33:52,342 --> 00:33:54,261
Luisa, will you just...

567
00:33:54,386 --> 00:33:56,805
- Just tell me what it is. - There's nothing to tell.

568
00:33:56,972 --> 00:33:59,015
You're obviously worried about something.

569
00:33:59,182 --> 00:34:01,059
Luisa, if you know what's hurting the magic

570
00:34:01,142 --> 00:34:02,822
and it gets worse, 'cause you won't tell me

571
00:34:02,852 --> 00:34:04,612
- what's wrong... - Nothing's wrong!

572
00:34:06,022 --> 00:34:07,691
Wow, uh, sorry.

573
00:34:07,774 --> 00:34:10,360
That... that snuck out there. What I meant was, um...

574
00:34:10,735 --> 00:34:12,028
Why would anything be wrong?

575
00:34:12,362 --> 00:34:13,673
I'm totally fine. The magic's fine.

576
00:34:13,697 --> 00:34:16,491
Luisa's fine. I'm totally not nervous.

577
00:34:17,492 --> 00:34:19,119
Your eye is doing the thing...

578
00:34:19,286 --> 00:34:22,080
I'm the strong one I'm not nervous

579
00:34:22,247 --> 00:34:24,583
I'm as tough as the crust of the earth is

580
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:27,002
okay.

581
00:34:27,085 --> 00:34:28,670
Lu isa: I move mountains

582
00:34:28,753 --> 00:34:29,963
I move churches

583
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,716
and I glow 'cause I know what my worth is

584
00:34:32,882 --> 00:34:35,093
of course, I mean... Hey, where are you going?

585
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,971
I don't ask how hard the work is

586
00:34:38,138 --> 00:34:40,181
got a rough indestructible surface

587
00:34:40,265 --> 00:34:41,600
diamonds and platinum

588
00:34:41,766 --> 00:34:42,976
I find 'em I flatten 'em

589
00:34:43,143 --> 00:34:45,729
I take what I'm handed I break what's demanded

590
00:34:45,895 --> 00:34:48,398
but under the surface I feel berserk

591
00:34:48,481 --> 00:34:51,318
as a tightrope Walker in a three-ring circus

592
00:34:51,484 --> 00:34:54,487
under the surface was Hercules ever like

593
00:34:54,613 --> 00:34:55,923
"yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus"

594
00:34:55,947 --> 00:34:58,283
- - Under the surface

595
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:01,786
I'm pretty sure I'm worthless if I can't be of service

596
00:35:01,953 --> 00:35:03,204
a flaw or a crack

597
00:35:03,371 --> 00:35:05,582
the straw in the stack that breaks the camel's back

598
00:35:05,749 --> 00:35:07,083
what breaks the camel's back?

599
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,918
It's pressure like a drip, drip, drip

600
00:35:09,002 --> 00:35:10,503
that'll never stop

601
00:35:11,004 --> 00:35:12,005
whoa

602
00:35:12,672 --> 00:35:15,634
pressure that'll tip, tip, tip till you just go pop

603
00:35:16,217 --> 00:35:17,719
whoa

604
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:20,263
give it to your sister your sister's older

605
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:23,350
give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder

606
00:35:23,516 --> 00:35:27,228
who am I if I can't run with the ball?

607
00:35:27,437 --> 00:35:30,231
If I fall to pressure like a grip, grip, grip

608
00:35:30,315 --> 00:35:31,566
and it won't let go

609
00:35:32,275 --> 00:35:33,318
whoa

610
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:35,612
pressure like a tick, tick, tick

611
00:35:35,695 --> 00:35:37,030
till it's ready to blow

612
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:39,199
whoa

613
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:41,951
give it to your sister your sister's stronger

614
00:35:42,118 --> 00:35:44,579
see if she can hang on a little longer

615
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:47,957
who am I if! Can't carry it all?

616
00:35:48,124 --> 00:35:49,918
If I falter

617
00:35:50,085 --> 00:35:51,419
under the surface

618
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:53,254
I hide my nerves and it worsens

619
00:35:53,338 --> 00:35:55,465
I worry something is gonna hurt us

620
00:35:55,632 --> 00:35:57,050
under the surface

621
00:35:57,217 --> 00:35:58,468
the ship doesn't swerve

622
00:35:58,551 --> 00:36:00,762
as it heard how big the iceberg is

623
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:03,848
under the surface I think about my purpose

624
00:36:04,015 --> 00:36:07,143
can I somehow preserve this? Line up the dominos

625
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,938
a light wind blows you try to stop it topplin'

626
00:36:10,105 --> 00:36:12,148
but on and on it goes but wait

627
00:36:13,066 --> 00:36:15,068
if I could shake

628
00:36:15,735 --> 00:36:19,864
the crushing weight of expectations

629
00:36:20,031 --> 00:36:23,368
would that free some room up for joy

630
00:36:23,618 --> 00:36:25,912
or relaxation?

631
00:36:26,413 --> 00:36:31,000
Or a simple pleasure instead we measure

632
00:36:31,918 --> 00:36:37,048
this growing pressure keeps growing

633
00:36:37,215 --> 00:36:43,263
keep going 'cause all we know is

634
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,223
pressure like a drip, drip, drip

635
00:36:45,306 --> 00:36:46,891
that'll never stop

636
00:36:47,058 --> 00:36:48,059
whoa

637
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:52,021
pressure that'll tip, tip, tip till you just go pop

638
00:36:52,439 --> 00:36:53,898
whoa

639
00:36:54,065 --> 00:36:56,192
give it to your sister it doesn't hurt

640
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:59,195
and see if she can handle every family burden

641
00:36:59,404 --> 00:37:02,741
watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks

642
00:37:04,534 --> 00:37:06,035
no mistakes

643
00:37:06,202 --> 00:37:07,662
just pressure like a grip, grip, grip

644
00:37:07,746 --> 00:37:09,205
and it won't let go

645
00:37:09,456 --> 00:37:10,707
whoa

646
00:37:11,499 --> 00:37:13,251
pressure like a tick, tick, tick

647
00:37:13,334 --> 00:37:14,502
till it's ready to blow

648
00:37:15,128 --> 00:37:16,504
whoa

649
00:37:16,671 --> 00:37:19,340
give it to your sister and never wonder

650
00:37:19,549 --> 00:37:21,968
if the same pressure would have pulled you under

651
00:37:22,135 --> 00:37:25,138
who am I if! Don't have what it takes?

652
00:37:25,305 --> 00:37:28,349
No cracks no breaks

653
00:37:28,516 --> 00:37:30,351
no mistakes no pressure

654
00:37:39,402 --> 00:37:43,782
I think you're carrying way too much...

655
00:37:44,032 --> 00:37:46,201
Maybe I overdo it.

656
00:37:47,786 --> 00:37:50,789
Um... there is something you should know.

657
00:37:50,955 --> 00:37:53,666
Last night, when you saw the cracks,

658
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:56,711
I felt weak.

659
00:37:57,545 --> 00:37:58,797
What?

660
00:37:58,963 --> 00:38:01,049
- Man: Luisa! The donkeys! - On it!

661
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,801
Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean?

662
00:38:03,134 --> 00:38:04,653
What do you think's hurting the magic?

663
00:38:04,677 --> 00:38:07,222
Don't know, but I heard the grown-ups once.

664
00:38:07,388 --> 00:38:09,098
Before tio Bruno left,

665
00:38:09,265 --> 00:38:11,935
he had, like, some terrible vision about it.

666
00:38:12,227 --> 00:38:14,854
Tio Bruno? What was in his vision?

667
00:38:15,021 --> 00:38:17,690
No one knows. They never found it.

668
00:38:17,857 --> 00:38:19,567
But if something's wrong with the magic,

669
00:38:19,651 --> 00:38:21,319
start with Bruno's tower.

670
00:38:21,486 --> 00:38:22,695
Find that vision.

671
00:38:23,196 --> 00:38:25,073
Wait! How do you find a vision?

672
00:38:25,156 --> 00:38:27,700
- What am I even looking for? -

673
00:38:27,784 --> 00:38:29,911
If you find it, you'll know.

674
00:38:30,078 --> 00:38:31,246
But be careful.

675
00:38:31,412 --> 00:38:34,374
That place is off limits for a reason.

676
00:38:35,834 --> 00:38:37,335
Abuela: Such a perfect match.

677
00:38:37,502 --> 00:38:38,503
So perfect.

678
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,630
And so good for the encanto.

679
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,398
Hmm.

680
00:38:59,858 --> 00:39:01,150
Casita.

681
00:39:02,068 --> 00:39:05,363
Can you turn off the sand?

682
00:39:08,825 --> 00:39:12,078
You can't help in here?

683
00:39:14,497 --> 00:39:15,665
I'll be fine.

684
00:39:16,332 --> 00:39:17,959
I need to do this.

685
00:39:18,126 --> 00:39:20,712
For you, for abuela,

686
00:39:21,379 --> 00:39:23,214
maybe a little for me.

687
00:39:24,549 --> 00:39:27,010
"Find the vision, save the..."

688
00:39:46,613 --> 00:39:47,614
Wow.

689
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,451
- Oh, hello. -

690
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:53,119
Lot of stairs,

691
00:39:53,786 --> 00:39:55,705
but at least I'll have a friend.

692
00:39:55,872 --> 00:39:57,916
No. He flew away immediately.

693
00:39:58,041 --> 00:39:59,626
- -

694
00:39:59,709 --> 00:40:01,002
All right.

695
00:40:01,169 --> 00:40:03,421
Welcome to the family madrigal

696
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:07,008
there's so many stairs in the casa madrigal

697
00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:10,762
you think there would be another way to

698
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:13,139
get so high 'cause we're magic, but no

699
00:40:13,389 --> 00:40:15,475
magical how many stairs fit in here!

700
00:40:15,642 --> 00:40:18,269
Bruno, your room is the worst!

701
00:40:28,905 --> 00:40:30,073
Come on...

702
00:40:33,993 --> 00:40:36,037
Okay, I can do this.

703
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:47,090
Whoo!

704
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,765
- -

705
00:41:14,325 --> 00:41:16,035
- -

706
00:41:32,635 --> 00:41:33,886
Mirabel: Quitter!

707
00:41:47,275 --> 00:41:48,443
Empty.

708
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,268
What's hurting the magic?

709
00:44:02,785 --> 00:44:05,204
Where are you coming from in such a hurry?

710
00:44:05,371 --> 00:44:06,497
I'm sorry, I was...

711
00:44:06,664 --> 00:44:08,541
- What is in your hair? -

712
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:10,001
Luisa: My gift!

713
00:44:10,126 --> 00:44:12,503
- I'm losing my gift! - What?

714
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:14,314
Mirabel and I were having this little talk

715
00:44:14,338 --> 00:44:15,590
about me carrying too much.

716
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:17,133
So, I tried not to carry so much,

717
00:44:17,216 --> 00:44:18,735
but I realised it was putting me behind.

718
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:20,428
And I knew I was gonna let everyone down.

719
00:44:20,595 --> 00:44:22,305
And I felt really bad,

720
00:44:22,388 --> 00:44:23,748
so I was grabbing all the donkeys,

721
00:44:23,973 --> 00:44:25,133
but then when I went to throw

722
00:44:25,183 --> 00:44:27,268
the donkeys in the barn, they were

723
00:44:27,435 --> 00:44:29,562
heavy!

724
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:34,734
What did you do? What did you say to her?

725
00:44:34,942 --> 00:44:36,527
Nothing. I... I don't...

726
00:44:36,694 --> 00:44:38,946
- Mirabel... -

727
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,573
I have to go get the guzmans

728
00:44:40,656 --> 00:44:42,158
for lsabela's engagement.

729
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:45,620
Stay away from luisa until I can talk to her.

730
00:44:45,786 --> 00:44:48,414
Tonight, we can't have any more problems.

731
00:44:48,748 --> 00:44:51,751
And whatever you're doing, stop doing it.

732
00:44:52,043 --> 00:44:55,171
- -

733
00:45:01,344 --> 00:45:03,095
Why am I in your vision, Bruno?

734
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:04,805
- -

735
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,266
Tia! Jeez.

736
00:45:07,433 --> 00:45:09,352
Sorry. Sorry, I didn't mean to...

737
00:45:09,685 --> 00:45:12,355
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

738
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:14,650
I just wanted to get the last of tofiito's things

739
00:45:14,774 --> 00:45:17,818
and then I heard the name we do not speak.

740
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:20,821
Great. Now I'm thundering,

741
00:45:20,905 --> 00:45:22,424
and that thunder will lead to a drizzle

742
00:45:22,448 --> 00:45:24,283
and a drizzle will lead to a sprinkle...

743
00:45:24,784 --> 00:45:27,495
Clear skies, clear skies.

744
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,748
Clear skies.

745
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:35,544
Tl'a pepa? If...

746
00:45:35,753 --> 00:45:39,340
If he had a vision about someone,

747
00:45:39,423 --> 00:45:40,675
what would it mean for them?

748
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:42,551
We don't talk about Bruno.

749
00:45:42,718 --> 00:45:45,054
I know. It's just hypothetically,

750
00:45:45,137 --> 00:45:46,472
if he saw you...

751
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:49,517
Mirabel, please, we need to get ready for the guzmans.

752
00:45:49,684 --> 00:45:51,227
I just wanna know if it was generally

753
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:52,853
positive or, like, less positive...

754
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,730
- It was a nightmare! - Félix!

755
00:45:54,897 --> 00:45:56,750
Hey, she needs to know, pepi, she needs to know.

756
00:45:56,774 --> 00:45:57,817
We don't talk about Bruno.

757
00:45:57,984 --> 00:46:00,403
He would see something terrible. And then...

758
00:46:00,528 --> 00:46:03,155
Boom! It would happen.

759
00:46:03,322 --> 00:46:04,490
We don't talk about Bruno.

760
00:46:04,657 --> 00:46:06,337
What if you didn't understand what he saw?

761
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:09,870
Then you better figure it out, because it was coming for you.

762
00:46:10,454 --> 00:46:15,001
We don't talk about Bruno-no-no-no

763
00:46:15,084 --> 00:46:18,879
we don't talk about Bruno

764
00:46:18,963 --> 00:46:22,341
-but it was my wedding day -it was our wedding day

765
00:46:22,508 --> 00:46:23,551
we were getting ready

766
00:46:23,634 --> 00:46:26,345
and there wasn't a cloud in the sky

767
00:46:26,429 --> 00:46:28,764
no clouds allowed in the sky

768
00:46:28,848 --> 00:46:32,393
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin

769
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,728
thunder

770
00:46:33,894 --> 00:46:35,938
you're telling the story or am I?

771
00:46:36,105 --> 00:46:37,898
I'm sorry, mi vida go on

772
00:46:38,232 --> 00:46:40,693
Bruno says it looks like rain

773
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,611
why did he tell her?

774
00:46:42,778 --> 00:46:44,947
In doing so he floods my brain

775
00:46:45,156 --> 00:46:47,325
abuela gets the umbrella

776
00:46:47,491 --> 00:46:48,593
pepa: Married in a hurricane

777
00:46:50,036 --> 00:46:52,496
What a joyous day but anyway

778
00:46:52,663 --> 00:46:57,084
we don't talk about Bruno-no-no-no

779
00:46:57,251 --> 00:47:00,421
we don't talk about Bruno

780
00:47:00,504 --> 00:47:01,547
hey

781
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:03,692
grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling

782
00:47:03,716 --> 00:47:04,818
I can always hear him sort of muttering

783
00:47:04,842 --> 00:47:05,885
and mumbling

784
00:47:06,052 --> 00:47:08,888
I associate him with the sound of falling sand

785
00:47:10,556 --> 00:47:12,892
It's a heavy lift with a gift so humbling

786
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:15,311
always left abuela and the family fumbling

787
00:47:15,478 --> 00:47:18,189
grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand

788
00:47:18,356 --> 00:47:19,648
do you understand?

789
00:47:19,815 --> 00:47:23,986
Seven-foot frame rats along his back

790
00:47:24,153 --> 00:47:28,616
when he calls your name it all fades to black

791
00:47:28,783 --> 00:47:32,953
yeah, he sees your dreams and feasts on your screams

792
00:47:34,497 --> 00:47:38,876
we don't talk about Bruno-no-no-no

793
00:47:39,043 --> 00:47:43,172
we don't talk about Bruno

794
00:47:43,464 --> 00:47:47,093
he told me my fish would die the next day dead

795
00:47:47,259 --> 00:47:48,260
chorus: No, no

796
00:47:48,427 --> 00:47:51,597
he told me I 'd grow a gut and just like he said

797
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,391
-no, no -he said that all my hair

798
00:47:53,474 --> 00:47:54,683
would disappear

799
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:56,435
now look at my head

800
00:47:56,602 --> 00:47:57,603
chorus: No, no

801
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:01,232
your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read

802
00:48:01,941 --> 00:48:05,528
he told me that the life of my dreams

803
00:48:05,694 --> 00:48:09,281
would he promised and someday be mine

804
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,829
He told me that my power would grow

805
00:48:14,995 --> 00:48:18,290
like the grapes that thrive on the vine

806
00:48:18,374 --> 00:48:20,543
abuela: Oye Mariano's on his way

807
00:48:20,709 --> 00:48:24,547
he told me that the man of my dreams

808
00:48:24,713 --> 00:48:27,174
would be just out of reach

809
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:29,844
betrothed to another

810
00:48:30,302 --> 00:48:32,972
-it's like I hear him now -hey, sis

811
00:48:34,014 --> 00:48:37,309
I want not a sound out of you

812
00:48:37,768 --> 00:48:39,687
Dolores: I can hear him now

813
00:48:39,854 --> 00:48:43,566
um, Bruno yeah, about that Bruno

814
00:48:43,732 --> 00:48:45,568
I really need to know about Bruno

815
00:48:45,651 --> 00:48:48,279
give me the truth and the whole truth, Bruno

816
00:48:48,446 --> 00:48:51,115
Isabela your boyfriend's here!

817
00:48:51,282 --> 00:48:53,284
All: Time for dinner

818
00:48:53,492 --> 00:48:56,912
-it was my wedding day -it was our wedding day

819
00:48:57,163 --> 00:48:59,915
and there wasn't a cloud in the sky

820
00:48:59,999 --> 00:49:02,501
no clouds allowed in the sky

821
00:49:02,585 --> 00:49:06,172
Isabela: He told me that my power would grow

822
00:49:06,338 --> 00:49:07,715
Felix: Thunder

823
00:49:07,798 --> 00:49:09,633
pepa: You're telling the story or am I?

824
00:49:09,717 --> 00:49:11,802
Abuela: Oye Mariano's on his way

825
00:49:11,969 --> 00:49:14,054
pepa: Bruno says it looks like rain

826
00:49:14,138 --> 00:49:15,973
Felix: Why did he tell her?

827
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:19,018
Pepa: In doing so, he floods my brain

828
00:49:19,101 --> 00:49:20,769
abuela gets the umbrella

829
00:49:20,936 --> 00:49:23,772
pepa: Married in a hurricane

830
00:49:25,524 --> 00:49:28,319
all: He's here, don't talk about Bruno-no

831
00:49:28,527 --> 00:49:31,155
why did I talk about Bruno?

832
00:49:31,363 --> 00:49:33,115
All: Not a word about Bruno

833
00:49:33,282 --> 00:49:35,493
I never should have brought up Bruno

834
00:49:37,578 --> 00:49:40,414
Miraboo! Got your party pants on? 'Cause I...

835
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:49,006
I broke into Bruno's tower.

836
00:49:49,173 --> 00:49:50,775
I found his last vision. The family's in trouble.

837
00:49:50,799 --> 00:49:52,986
The magic is dying. The house is breaking, luisa's gift is fading.

838
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:55,846
And I think it's all because of me?

839
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:00,434
Pa?

840
00:50:03,938 --> 00:50:05,397
We say nothing.

841
00:50:05,481 --> 00:50:06,982
Abuela wants tonight to be perfect.

842
00:50:07,149 --> 00:50:08,275
Until the guzmans leave,

843
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:09,839
you did not break into Bruno's tower.

844
00:50:09,944 --> 00:50:11,946
The magic is not dying. The house is not breaking.

845
00:50:12,112 --> 00:50:13,656
Luisa's gift is not fading.

846
00:50:13,822 --> 00:50:16,450
No one will know. Just act normal.

847
00:50:16,617 --> 00:50:19,328
- No one has to know. -

848
00:50:25,459 --> 00:50:26,669
She's gonna tell everyone.

849
00:50:26,835 --> 00:50:30,005
- Abuela: Time to eat! - Miercoles.

850
00:50:30,089 --> 00:50:32,758
The guzmans and the madrigals together

851
00:50:32,841 --> 00:50:34,885
will be so good for the encanto.

852
00:50:35,052 --> 00:50:39,348
Yes. Then, let's hope tonight is not a horrible disaster.

853
00:50:39,431 --> 00:50:41,850
- - Abuela: To a perfect night!

854
00:50:41,934 --> 00:50:43,644
- Salud! - All: Salud!

855
00:50:51,569 --> 00:50:53,487
- Mariano: Avocado? -

856
00:50:54,196 --> 00:50:56,240
-

857
00:50:58,576 --> 00:51:00,786
Camilo. Fix your face.

858
00:51:01,954 --> 00:51:03,474
- Isabela: Water? -

859
00:51:07,293 --> 00:51:08,711
- - Mirabel.

860
00:51:08,919 --> 00:51:11,589
- - The cream, please?

861
00:51:11,797 --> 00:51:14,883
- Pé, the cream? -

862
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,512
Bruno's vision.

863
00:51:19,263 --> 00:51:21,348
- Pepa, the cloud. -

864
00:51:21,515 --> 00:51:23,892
Clear skies, clear skies, clear skies.

865
00:51:24,226 --> 00:51:27,062
Bruno's vision.

866
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:29,189
- Mirabel: Oh. -

867
00:51:32,276 --> 00:51:34,486
- Mariano: Mirabel? -

868
00:51:34,653 --> 00:51:35,863
Everything okay?

869
00:51:35,988 --> 00:51:39,074
Everything is great. She's just excited.

870
00:51:39,241 --> 00:51:41,001
For you to propose. Which, uh, you should do!

871
00:51:41,035 --> 00:51:42,661
- Yes. - As fast as you can.

872
00:51:42,745 --> 00:51:44,663
Uh, I was actually gonna...

873
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,540
You were actually gonna. Great!

874
00:51:48,417 --> 00:51:52,463
Well, since everyone here has a talent,

875
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:55,132
my Mariano wanted to begin with a song!

876
00:51:55,299 --> 00:51:58,177
Luisa, could you bring over the piano?

877
00:51:58,844 --> 00:52:01,472
- Okay. -

878
00:52:01,555 --> 00:52:05,225
Uh, it's actually family tradition to sing after.

879
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:11,440
Isabela, most graceful of all the madrigals.

880
00:52:12,983 --> 00:52:15,569
- Um... - You're doing great.

881
00:52:15,903 --> 00:52:18,197
- The most perfect flower... -

882
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,040
- - In this entire encanto...

883
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,160
- -

884
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:31,335
Will you marry...

885
00:52:33,253 --> 00:52:35,506
- -

886
00:52:35,631 --> 00:52:38,550
What is happening?

887
00:52:38,717 --> 00:52:40,320
Mirabel found Bruno's vision. She's in it.

888
00:52:40,344 --> 00:52:42,680
She's gonna destroy the magic and now, we're all doomed!

889
00:52:59,488 --> 00:53:01,115
- -

890
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:12,769
- - Sefiora, por favor!

891
00:53:12,793 --> 00:53:15,170
Abuela, please! There's gotta be an explanation.

892
00:53:15,337 --> 00:53:16,630
I hate you!

893
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:18,465
- I'm a loser! - Luisa!

894
00:53:18,632 --> 00:53:19,717
What did you do?

895
00:53:19,883 --> 00:53:24,138
I'm not doing anything! It's Bruno's vision! It's...

896
00:53:30,018 --> 00:53:34,523
The magic is strong! Everything is fine!

897
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:37,109
We are the madrigals!

898
00:53:37,443 --> 00:53:39,194
- Mirabel! -

899
00:54:18,901 --> 00:54:20,068
- -

900
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:51,892
It's okay, mami.

901
00:54:51,975 --> 00:54:53,852
Deep breath in, deep breath out.

902
00:54:54,394 --> 00:54:56,313
- -

903
00:54:57,689 --> 00:54:58,690
Stop!

904
00:55:00,776 --> 00:55:02,027
Stop!

905
00:55:24,466 --> 00:55:26,635
No! No!

906
00:55:26,802 --> 00:55:28,929
Help! Help...

907
00:55:29,221 --> 00:55:32,266
Casita! Casita!

908
00:55:32,432 --> 00:55:33,600
Help me!

909
00:55:34,017 --> 00:55:35,018
Help me!

910
00:55:40,357 --> 00:55:42,359
You're very sweaty.

911
00:55:45,529 --> 00:55:46,649
- - Oh, no!

912
00:55:53,078 --> 00:55:54,079
Hmm.

913
00:56:00,627 --> 00:56:01,879
- Bye. - What?

914
00:56:02,045 --> 00:56:03,630
No. Hold on!

915
00:56:03,714 --> 00:56:04,715
Wait! Wait!

916
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:05,799
- - Ow.

917
00:56:05,883 --> 00:56:07,009
Why did you take the vision?

918
00:56:07,175 --> 00:56:08,403
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock. Knock on wood.

919
00:56:08,427 --> 00:56:09,821
- Mirabel: What does it mean? -

920
00:56:09,845 --> 00:56:11,847
Is it why you came back or...

921
00:56:12,723 --> 00:56:13,825
- - Tio Bruno?

922
00:56:13,849 --> 00:56:15,769
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock. Knock on wood.

923
00:56:15,851 --> 00:56:18,937
You were never supposed to see that vision. No one was.

924
00:56:19,104 --> 00:56:20,939
- But... - A little salt.

925
00:56:22,232 --> 00:56:23,817
- Sugar. -

926
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:29,568
Mirabel: Wait.

927
00:56:30,282 --> 00:56:33,243
Have you been in here patching the cracks?

928
00:56:34,202 --> 00:56:35,704
Oh, that? No, no, no.

929
00:56:35,787 --> 00:56:37,456
I'm too scared to go near those things.

930
00:56:37,623 --> 00:56:39,666
All the patching's done by hernando.

931
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:41,001
Who is hernando?

932
00:56:41,084 --> 00:56:43,295
I'm hernando and I'm scared of nothing!

933
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:46,965
It's actually me.

934
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:49,760
I used to say my real gift was "acting."

935
00:56:50,928 --> 00:56:53,555
I'm Jorge. I make the spackle.

936
00:56:55,682 --> 00:56:58,644
How long have you been back here?

937
00:57:04,232 --> 00:57:05,776
You never left.

938
00:57:06,818 --> 00:57:08,195
Well, I left my tower,

939
00:57:08,278 --> 00:57:10,113
which was, you know, a lot of stairs

940
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:14,034
and here, eh, kitchen adjacent.

941
00:57:14,493 --> 00:57:17,037
Ooh, ooh, plus, free entertainment.

942
00:57:17,204 --> 00:57:19,122
So, what do you like? You like sports?

943
00:57:19,581 --> 00:57:22,167
Game shows? Telenovelas?

944
00:57:23,835 --> 00:57:26,296
Their love could never be.

945
00:57:26,463 --> 00:57:28,006
I don't understand.

946
00:57:28,173 --> 00:57:30,053
Well, because she's his aunt and she has amnesia

947
00:57:30,217 --> 00:57:32,094
so she can't remember that she's his aunt.

948
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,763
It's like a very forbidden kind of...

949
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:38,016
I don't understand why you left,

950
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,143
but didn't leave.

951
00:57:40,936 --> 00:57:42,646
Oh, well, because, huh,

952
00:57:42,729 --> 00:57:45,607
the mountains around the encanto are pretty tall.

953
00:57:45,774 --> 00:57:49,653
And, uh, like I said, free food and everything.

954
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:51,905
You guys love the free food, don't ya?

955
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,658
Always hungry. Never satisfied.

956
00:58:14,678 --> 00:58:18,140
Yeah, my gift wasn't helping the family,

957
00:58:18,306 --> 00:58:20,934
but, uh, I love my family, you know?

958
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,272
I just don't know how to... I just don't know how to...

959
00:58:25,897 --> 00:58:28,358
Well, anyway, I think you should go, because, um,

960
00:58:28,567 --> 00:58:29,669
I don't really have a good reason,

961
00:58:29,693 --> 00:58:30,853
but, if I did, you'd be like,

962
00:58:30,902 --> 00:58:32,622
"I should go, because that's a good reason."

963
00:58:34,614 --> 00:58:35,824
Why was I in your vision?

964
00:58:38,285 --> 00:58:39,661
Tio Bruno?

965
00:58:41,997 --> 00:58:46,001
I just wanted to make the family proud of me.

966
00:58:46,543 --> 00:58:47,794
Just once.

967
00:58:49,921 --> 00:58:51,757
But if I should stop,

968
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,635
if I'm hurting my family,

969
00:58:56,511 --> 00:58:58,388
just tell me.

970
00:58:59,514 --> 00:59:01,892
- I can't tell you... -

971
00:59:01,975 --> 00:59:03,894
Because I don't know.

972
00:59:04,686 --> 00:59:09,066
I had this vision the night that you didn't get your gift.

973
00:59:09,983 --> 00:59:11,568
Abuela worried about the magic.

974
00:59:11,735 --> 00:59:14,529
So, she begged me to look into the future.

975
00:59:14,613 --> 00:59:15,614
See what it meant.

976
00:59:17,074 --> 00:59:20,285
And I saw the magic in danger.

977
00:59:21,161 --> 00:59:24,247
Our house breaking.

978
00:59:24,414 --> 00:59:28,251
And then, and then, and then, lsaw you.

979
00:59:28,418 --> 00:59:32,005
But the vision was different. It... it would change.

980
00:59:32,172 --> 00:59:35,425
And there was no one answer. No clear fate.

981
00:59:35,592 --> 00:59:38,553
Like your future was undecided.

982
00:59:39,471 --> 00:59:40,698
But I knew how it was gonna look.

983
00:59:40,722 --> 00:59:42,002
I knew what everyone would think

984
00:59:42,057 --> 00:59:43,100
because I'm Bruno

985
00:59:43,183 --> 00:59:45,060
and everyone always assumes the worst, so...

986
00:59:46,937 --> 00:59:48,313
So...

987
00:59:49,689 --> 00:59:54,569
You left to protect me?

988
00:59:55,779 --> 00:59:57,489
I don't know which way it'll go,

989
00:59:58,323 --> 00:59:59,574
but my guess...

990
00:59:59,741 --> 01:00:01,993
The family, the encanto

991
01:00:02,369 --> 01:00:04,329
and the fate of the miracle itself...

992
01:00:05,497 --> 01:00:07,374
Well, it's all gonna come down to you.

993
01:00:10,001 --> 01:00:11,128
Or maybe I'm wrong.

994
01:00:11,294 --> 01:00:13,797
You know, it's a mystery. That's why this vision is...

995
01:00:15,674 --> 01:00:19,219
Look, if I could help any more, I would,

996
01:00:19,386 --> 01:00:21,429
but that's all I know.

997
01:00:21,763 --> 01:00:24,641
Good luck. I wish I could've seen more.

998
01:00:25,934 --> 01:00:26,935
Yeah.

999
01:00:30,689 --> 01:00:32,107
Yeah.

1000
01:00:33,275 --> 01:00:35,777
You wish you could have seen more, so see more!

1001
01:00:35,944 --> 01:00:37,904
Have another vision.

1002
01:00:38,071 --> 01:00:40,448
Oh. No, no. See, I don't do visions any more.

1003
01:00:40,615 --> 01:00:41,825
- But you could. - But I won't.

1004
01:00:41,992 --> 01:00:43,869
You can't say the weight of the world

1005
01:00:43,952 --> 01:00:45,996
is on your shoulders. The end.

1006
01:00:46,163 --> 01:00:49,916
If our fate's up to me, me says have another vision.

1007
01:00:50,792 --> 01:00:52,043
Maybe it'll show me what to do.

1008
01:00:52,210 --> 01:00:54,254
Look, even if I wanted to, which I don't,

1009
01:00:54,337 --> 01:00:56,047
you wrecked my vision cave.

1010
01:00:56,214 --> 01:00:58,717
Which is a problem, 'cause I need a big open space.

1011
01:00:58,884 --> 01:01:00,468
- We'll find one. - Where?

1012
01:01:00,635 --> 01:01:01,636
Antonio: Use my room.

1013
01:01:03,013 --> 01:01:05,891
The rats told me everything. Don't eat those.

1014
01:01:09,311 --> 01:01:11,605
Our family needs help,

1015
01:01:11,688 --> 01:01:14,191
and you need to get outta here.

1016
01:01:20,989 --> 01:01:22,073
Meh.

1017
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:33,919
You should have told me the second you saw the vision.

1018
01:01:34,085 --> 01:01:35,086
Think of the family.

1019
01:01:35,295 --> 01:01:37,297
I was thinking of my daughter.

1020
01:01:38,173 --> 01:01:39,716
Pepa, calm down.

1021
01:01:39,883 --> 01:01:41,134
- I'm doing my best. - Yes.

1022
01:01:41,301 --> 01:01:42,928
You're lucky it's not a hurricane.

1023
01:01:43,094 --> 01:01:46,556
Mama', you've always been too hard on mirabel.

1024
01:01:46,723 --> 01:01:48,141
Look around.

1025
01:01:48,308 --> 01:01:51,186
We must protect our family, our encanto.

1026
01:01:51,269 --> 01:01:54,105
- We cannot lose our home. -

1027
01:01:54,189 --> 01:01:55,482
Sefiora, perdon.

1028
01:01:55,565 --> 01:01:57,567
People in town are becoming anxious

1029
01:01:57,651 --> 01:01:59,027
about the magic.

1030
01:01:59,194 --> 01:02:00,445
They want to see you.

1031
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:03,740
Mirabel was in that vision for a reason.

1032
01:02:04,991 --> 01:02:06,076
Find her.

1033
01:02:07,911 --> 01:02:10,163
- -

1034
01:02:11,748 --> 01:02:13,959
We might wanna hurry.

1035
01:02:14,125 --> 01:02:16,336
You can't hurry the future.

1036
01:02:16,419 --> 01:02:17,796
Um...

1037
01:02:19,047 --> 01:02:21,007
What if I show you something worse?

1038
01:02:21,174 --> 01:02:22,300
If I see something

1039
01:02:22,384 --> 01:02:23,778
that you don't like, you're gonna be all,

1040
01:02:23,802 --> 01:02:25,178
"Bruno makes bad things happen.

1041
01:02:25,262 --> 01:02:27,681
"Oh, he's creepy and his vision killed my goldfish."

1042
01:02:28,265 --> 01:02:30,475
I don't think you make bad things happen.

1043
01:02:31,268 --> 01:02:35,438
Sometimes family weirdos just get a bad rap.

1044
01:02:36,231 --> 01:02:37,440
You can do this.

1045
01:02:41,152 --> 01:02:42,195
For the nerves.

1046
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:49,703
I can do this. I can do this, I can do this, I can do this.

1047
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,739
You might wanna hang on.

1048
01:03:59,856 --> 01:04:02,567
Bruno: It's just the same thing. I gotta stop!

1049
01:04:02,734 --> 01:04:05,278
No. I need to know which way it goes.

1050
01:04:05,362 --> 01:04:07,280
There's gotta be an answer.

1051
01:04:07,447 --> 01:04:08,615
Something we're not seeing!

1052
01:04:08,782 --> 01:04:10,462
You're looking at the same thing that I am.

1053
01:04:10,492 --> 01:04:11,594
If there was something else...

1054
01:04:11,618 --> 01:04:13,620
There! Over there!

1055
01:04:14,371 --> 01:04:15,372
Bruno: Butterfly!

1056
01:04:15,455 --> 01:04:16,956
Follow the butterfly!

1057
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:23,463
Where is that?

1058
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,799
Bruno: It's all out of order.

1059
01:04:26,966 --> 01:04:30,637
It's the candle. The candle's getting brighter!

1060
01:04:30,845 --> 01:04:32,430
I think you're gonna help the candle!

1061
01:04:32,514 --> 01:04:33,598
How?

1062
01:04:33,681 --> 01:04:36,643
Uh, there's someone with you. And you...

1063
01:04:36,726 --> 01:04:37,852
- You fight her! - What?

1064
01:04:38,019 --> 01:04:39,604
Wait, no, no. Is that a hug?

1065
01:04:39,771 --> 01:04:40,772
Am I fighting or hugging?

1066
01:04:41,773 --> 01:04:43,817
An embrace. An embrace!

1067
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:45,902
To make the candle bright you have to embrace her.

1068
01:04:46,069 --> 01:04:47,362
Embrace who?

1069
01:04:47,445 --> 01:04:48,947
Bruno: Oh... almost there.

1070
01:04:49,114 --> 01:04:51,408
- Who is it? - Almost there. Oh, oh.

1071
01:04:51,825 --> 01:04:52,826
I got it!

1072
01:04:54,577 --> 01:04:56,121
Isabela?

1073
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:03,503
Oh, your sister? That's great!

1074
01:05:05,004 --> 01:05:06,756
Every time.

1075
01:05:07,924 --> 01:05:11,094
Mirabel: Why would embracing Isabela do anything?

1076
01:05:11,261 --> 01:05:13,054
I don't know. Our family got a miracle.

1077
01:05:13,138 --> 01:05:14,240
How do you help a family miracle?

1078
01:05:14,264 --> 01:05:15,265
You hug a sister.

1079
01:05:15,432 --> 01:05:18,476
Mirabel? Mirabel?

1080
01:05:19,352 --> 01:05:21,479
Mirabel?

1081
01:05:21,646 --> 01:05:23,606
Well, I think we're running out of time here.

1082
01:05:23,773 --> 01:05:25,150
It's not gonna work.

1083
01:05:25,316 --> 01:05:28,319
She won't hug me ever, okay? She hates me!

1084
01:05:28,486 --> 01:05:29,766
Also, I don't know if you heard,

1085
01:05:29,821 --> 01:05:30,947
I ruined her proposal!

1086
01:05:31,114 --> 01:05:32,157
Plus, p.S...

1087
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,759
- Mirabel? - She is just annoying.

1088
01:05:33,783 --> 01:05:35,493
- Of course it's Isabela! - Mirabel?

1089
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:37,020
What's her problem with me anyway?

1090
01:05:37,162 --> 01:05:38,556
She's the one with roses coming out of her...

1091
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:39,747
Mirabel!

1092
01:05:39,914 --> 01:05:41,416
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1093
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:43,418
You see, you're missing the point.

1094
01:05:43,835 --> 01:05:46,087
The fate of the family, it's not up to her.

1095
01:05:46,254 --> 01:05:47,630
It's up to you.

1096
01:05:48,173 --> 01:05:51,509
You're exactly what this family needs.

1097
01:05:52,886 --> 01:05:54,387
You just have to see it.

1098
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:58,141
By yourself, after I leave.

1099
01:05:58,266 --> 01:06:00,059
What, you're not coming?

1100
01:06:01,227 --> 01:06:02,947
It was your vision, mirabel.

1101
01:06:03,021 --> 01:06:04,022
Not mine.

1102
01:06:04,189 --> 01:06:05,607
You're afraid abuela will see you.

1103
01:06:05,773 --> 01:06:07,734
Yep. I mean, yes, that too.

1104
01:06:09,944 --> 01:06:13,448
Hey, after you save the miracle, come visit.

1105
01:06:14,407 --> 01:06:18,870
After I save the miracle, I'm bringing you home.

1106
01:06:19,996 --> 01:06:21,891
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock. Knock on wood.

1107
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:38,264
You got this. Just gonna save the miracle.

1108
01:06:39,182 --> 01:06:40,683
With a hug.

1109
01:06:41,893 --> 01:06:44,687
Isa? Hey.

1110
01:06:45,396 --> 01:06:48,441
I know we've had our issues,

1111
01:06:48,608 --> 01:06:50,777
but I'm

1112
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:54,405
Ready to be a better sister... to you.

1113
01:06:54,822 --> 01:06:57,116
So, we should just hug.

1114
01:06:57,534 --> 01:06:59,869
Let's hug it out, huh?

1115
01:07:00,995 --> 01:07:03,331
Isabela: "Hug it out"?

1116
01:07:04,374 --> 01:07:07,043
Luisa can't lift an empanada,

1117
01:07:07,502 --> 01:07:11,422
Mariano's nose looks like a smashed papaya!

1118
01:07:11,965 --> 01:07:13,508
Have you lost your mind?

1119
01:07:14,968 --> 01:07:17,971
Isa, I feel like you're upset.

1120
01:07:18,137 --> 01:07:20,431
And you know what cures being upset?

1121
01:07:20,515 --> 01:07:21,933
A warm embrace.

1122
01:07:22,433 --> 01:07:24,060
Get out.

1123
01:07:24,185 --> 01:07:27,438
- - Everything was perfect.

1124
01:07:27,605 --> 01:07:29,816
Abuela was happy. The family was happy.

1125
01:07:29,983 --> 01:07:35,780
You wanna be a better sister? Apologise for ruining my life.

1126
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:43,037
Go on. Apologise.

1127
01:07:51,713 --> 01:07:52,714
Sorry...

1128
01:07:53,423 --> 01:07:54,591
Hmm.

1129
01:07:55,174 --> 01:07:57,385
That your life is so great!

1130
01:07:57,468 --> 01:07:58,469
Out.

1131
01:07:58,553 --> 01:08:01,180
Wait! Fine! Iapologise!

1132
01:08:02,056 --> 01:08:04,434
I wasn't trying to ruin your life!

1133
01:08:05,101 --> 01:08:07,895
Some of us have bigger problems,

1134
01:08:08,062 --> 01:08:09,063
- you selfish... -

1135
01:08:09,147 --> 01:08:10,565
Entitled Princess!

1136
01:08:10,732 --> 01:08:11,983
"Selfish"?

1137
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:16,904
I've been stuck being perfect my whole entire life!

1138
01:08:17,071 --> 01:08:18,740
And literally, the only thing

1139
01:08:18,823 --> 01:08:20,867
you have ever done for me is mess things up!

1140
01:08:21,034 --> 01:08:22,368
Nothing is messed up!

1141
01:08:22,493 --> 01:08:24,495
You can still marry that big dumb hunk!

1142
01:08:24,662 --> 01:08:28,541
I never wanted to marry him! I was doing it for the family!

1143
01:08:30,877 --> 01:08:32,295
Oh, my gosh.

1144
01:08:32,754 --> 01:08:33,796
Isa,

1145
01:08:33,963 --> 01:08:37,592
that is a very serious confession.

1146
01:08:37,925 --> 01:08:40,428
Okay, get over here.

1147
01:08:40,595 --> 01:08:41,721
Bring it in.

1148
01:08:46,768 --> 01:08:49,312
I just made something unexpected

1149
01:08:50,396 --> 01:08:54,317
something sharp something new

1150
01:08:54,484 --> 01:08:56,694
isa? Uh, this is the part where we...

1151
01:08:56,861 --> 01:08:59,072
It's not symmetrical or perfect

1152
01:08:59,155 --> 01:09:00,698
but it's beautiful

1153
01:09:00,865 --> 01:09:04,827
and it's mine what else can I do?

1154
01:09:04,994 --> 01:09:06,371
Wait bring it in, bring it in

1155
01:09:06,579 --> 01:09:07,765
good talk bring it in, bring it in

1156
01:09:07,789 --> 01:09:08,873
what else can I do?

1157
01:09:09,082 --> 01:09:10,792
Let's hug bring it in, bring it in

1158
01:09:10,958 --> 01:09:12,278
free hugs bring it in, bring it in

1159
01:09:12,418 --> 01:09:16,130
I grow rows and rows of roses

1160
01:09:16,631 --> 01:09:20,468
flor de Mayo by the mile

1161
01:09:20,635 --> 01:09:24,806
I make perfect practised poses

1162
01:09:24,972 --> 01:09:28,768
so much hides behind my smile

1163
01:09:28,935 --> 01:09:30,853
what could I do if I just grew

1164
01:09:30,937 --> 01:09:34,148
what I was feeling in the moment?

1165
01:09:34,315 --> 01:09:36,150
Do you know where you're going?

1166
01:09:36,651 --> 01:09:41,239
What could I do if I just knew it didn't need to be perfect?

1167
01:09:41,406 --> 01:09:44,659
It just needed to be and they let me be

1168
01:09:44,826 --> 01:09:48,538
a hurricane of jacarandas

1169
01:09:48,705 --> 01:09:50,289
-strangling figs -fig!

1170
01:09:50,373 --> 01:09:51,833
Hanging vines

1171
01:09:51,916 --> 01:09:52,917
this is fine

1172
01:09:53,084 --> 01:09:59,006
palma de cera fills the air as I climb and I push through

1173
01:09:59,173 --> 01:10:01,426
what else can I do?

1174
01:10:02,218 --> 01:10:05,888
Can I deliver us a river of sundew?

1175
01:10:06,055 --> 01:10:09,851
Careful, it's carnivorous a little just won't do

1176
01:10:10,017 --> 01:10:13,312
I wanna feel the shiver of something new

1177
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:14,981
I'm so sick of pretty

1178
01:10:15,064 --> 01:10:17,066
I want something true don't you?

1179
01:10:17,233 --> 01:10:19,944
You just seemed like your life's been a dream

1180
01:10:20,027 --> 01:10:22,363
since the moment you opened your eyes

1181
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:24,741
how far do these roots go down?

1182
01:10:24,907 --> 01:10:28,035
All I know are the blossoms you grow

1183
01:10:28,202 --> 01:10:30,705
but it's awesome to see how you rise

1184
01:10:30,872 --> 01:10:32,707
- how far can I rise? - How far can you rise?

1185
01:10:32,874 --> 01:10:36,836
Through the roof to the skies let's go

1186
01:10:37,003 --> 01:10:40,339
a hurricane of jacarandas

1187
01:10:40,506 --> 01:10:42,300
-strangling figs -go

1188
01:10:42,508 --> 01:10:44,886
-hanging vines -grow

1189
01:10:45,052 --> 01:10:50,892
palma de cera fills the air as I climb and I push through

1190
01:10:51,058 --> 01:10:52,810
what else? What else?

1191
01:10:52,977 --> 01:10:54,604
What can you do when you are

1192
01:10:54,687 --> 01:10:57,565
deeply madly truly in the moment?

1193
01:10:57,732 --> 01:11:00,818
Seize the moment keep going

1194
01:11:00,985 --> 01:11:02,528
what can you do when you know

1195
01:11:02,612 --> 01:11:05,031
who you want to be isn't perfect?

1196
01:11:05,281 --> 01:11:08,659
-But I 'ii still be okay -hey, everybody clear the way

1197
01:11:08,826 --> 01:11:11,287
I'm coming through with tabebuia

1198
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:12,663
tabebuia

1199
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:14,540
-making waves -making waves

1200
01:11:14,749 --> 01:11:17,084
-changing minds -you've changed mine

1201
01:11:17,251 --> 01:11:19,504
the way is clearer 'cause you're here

1202
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:23,049
and well I owe this all to you

1203
01:11:23,216 --> 01:11:24,967
what else can I do?

1204
01:11:25,176 --> 01:11:27,053
Mirabel: Show them what you can do

1205
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:30,932
- what else can I do? - There's nothing you can't do

1206
01:11:31,098 --> 01:11:34,560
Isabela: What else can I do?

1207
01:11:35,561 --> 01:11:39,023
- You're a bad influence. -

1208
01:11:39,232 --> 01:11:41,025
Abuela: What is going on?

1209
01:11:41,526 --> 01:11:42,652
- - Abuela?

1210
01:11:42,735 --> 01:11:44,028
It's okay! Everything's...

1211
01:11:44,195 --> 01:11:45,905
We're gonna save the miracle. The magic...

1212
01:11:46,072 --> 01:11:47,532
What are you talking about?

1213
01:11:47,698 --> 01:11:50,034
Look at our home! Look at your sister!

1214
01:11:50,201 --> 01:11:53,246
Please just... Isabela wasn't happy.

1215
01:11:53,454 --> 01:11:55,581
Of course she isn't happy. You ruined her proposal.

1216
01:11:55,748 --> 01:11:58,042
No, no, no. She needed me to ruin her proposal.

1217
01:11:58,209 --> 01:11:59,853
- And then we did all this! -

1218
01:11:59,877 --> 01:12:01,146
And the candle burned brighter and the cracks...

1219
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:02,839
- Mirabel. - That's why I'm in the vision!

1220
01:12:03,005 --> 01:12:04,257
I'm saving the miracle!

1221
01:12:04,423 --> 01:12:06,801
You have to stop, mirabel!

1222
01:12:09,637 --> 01:12:11,806
The cracks started with you.

1223
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:14,767
- Bruno left because of you. -

1224
01:12:14,934 --> 01:12:18,396
Luisa's losing her powers. Isabela's out of control.

1225
01:12:18,563 --> 01:12:20,231
Because of you!

1226
01:12:20,398 --> 01:12:23,150
I don't know why you weren't given a gift,

1227
01:12:23,317 --> 01:12:27,154
but it is not an excuse for you to hurt this family.

1228
01:12:27,238 --> 01:12:30,199
- -

1229
01:12:37,415 --> 01:12:42,169
I will never be good enough for you.

1230
01:12:43,212 --> 01:12:44,297
Will I?

1231
01:12:47,174 --> 01:12:50,469
No matter how hard I try.

1232
01:12:55,516 --> 01:12:59,687
No matter how hard any of us tries.

1233
01:13:00,646 --> 01:13:04,025
Luisa will never be strong enough.

1234
01:13:04,191 --> 01:13:07,236
Isabela won't be perfect enough.

1235
01:13:07,403 --> 01:13:10,239
Bruno left our family because you only saw the worst in him.

1236
01:13:10,406 --> 01:13:12,450
Bruno didn't care about this family.

1237
01:13:12,617 --> 01:13:13,993
He loves this family.

1238
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:17,997
I love this family. We all love this family.

1239
01:13:18,164 --> 01:13:19,540
You're the one that doesn't care.

1240
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:22,019
You're the one breaking our home.

1241
01:13:22,043 --> 01:13:23,044
Don't you ever...

1242
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:25,880
The miracle is dying, because of you.

1243
01:13:30,551 --> 01:13:32,219
No, no, no!

1244
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:34,805
Felix: The candle!

1245
01:13:41,896 --> 01:13:43,272
Casita! Get me up there!

1246
01:13:55,868 --> 01:13:58,621
Nol

1247
01:14:03,376 --> 01:14:05,252
No!

1248
01:14:17,181 --> 01:14:18,432
Careful, Antonio!

1249
01:14:19,225 --> 01:14:20,476
We gotta get out of here!

1250
01:14:20,643 --> 01:14:22,478
Mirabel! Mirabel!

1251
01:14:23,062 --> 01:14:25,439
Mirabel, we have to get out!

1252
01:14:36,450 --> 01:14:37,535
- Mirabel! - Mirabel!

1253
01:14:37,702 --> 01:14:39,120
Julieta: Mirabel, leave it!

1254
01:14:43,374 --> 01:14:46,669
Agustin: Mirabel! The house is going to fall!

1255
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:51,799
Julieta: Mirabel, get out! Agustin: Mirabel!

1256
01:15:22,747 --> 01:15:24,498
- -

1257
01:15:32,923 --> 01:15:34,216
Julieta: Mirabel!

1258
01:15:35,801 --> 01:15:38,137
Mirabel, are you hurt?

1259
01:15:41,307 --> 01:15:42,433
Mirabel!

1260
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,060
Pepa: Julieta, come quick!

1261
01:15:44,185 --> 01:15:45,561
- - Julieta!

1262
01:15:45,728 --> 01:15:48,105
Don't move. I'll be right back.

1263
01:15:50,274 --> 01:15:52,485
Pepa: How did this happen?

1264
01:15:52,651 --> 01:15:55,196
Dolores: Here, let me help you. Let me help you.

1265
01:15:55,362 --> 01:15:56,530
Agustin: Everyone okay?

1266
01:15:56,614 --> 01:15:58,199
Pepa: Antonio, don't cry, papito.

1267
01:15:58,449 --> 01:16:01,744
Felix: How is this possible? The encanto's broken.

1268
01:16:01,911 --> 01:16:03,162
Pepa: What do we do now?

1269
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:05,247
Camilo: My powers. They're gone.

1270
01:16:05,456 --> 01:16:07,500
What about Antonio? What is he gonna do?

1271
01:16:12,797 --> 01:16:14,632
Mirabel?

1272
01:16:15,257 --> 01:16:17,843
Mirabel! Where's mirabel?

1273
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:19,178
Where is she?

1274
01:16:19,345 --> 01:16:20,596
Mirabel!

1275
01:16:21,764 --> 01:16:22,807
Felix: Mirabel?

1276
01:16:24,517 --> 01:16:25,726
Mirabel!

1277
01:16:38,405 --> 01:16:39,405
Luisa: Mirabel?

1278
01:16:42,493 --> 01:16:43,577
Mirabel!

1279
01:16:45,955 --> 01:16:47,540
Felix: Mirabel!

1280
01:16:48,124 --> 01:16:49,917
They haven't found her yet?

1281
01:16:50,709 --> 01:16:52,711
- Mirabel! - Mirabel!

1282
01:16:53,337 --> 01:16:54,839
Mirabel!

1283
01:17:13,315 --> 01:17:14,525
Abuela: Mirabel.

1284
01:17:22,241 --> 01:17:24,076
I'm sorry.

1285
01:17:25,578 --> 01:17:28,497
I didn't want to hurt us.

1286
01:17:29,456 --> 01:17:31,667
I just wanted

1287
01:17:32,459 --> 01:17:35,087
to be something I'm not.

1288
01:17:50,019 --> 01:17:53,647
I've never been able to come back here.

1289
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:02,698
This river is where we were given our miracle.

1290
01:18:04,825 --> 01:18:07,828
Where abuelo Pedro...

1291
01:18:11,457 --> 01:18:14,585
I thought we would have a different life.

1292
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,381
I thought I would be a different woman.

1293
01:18:42,071 --> 01:18:43,906
Man: Two caterpillars

1294
01:18:45,074 --> 01:18:46,450
In love

1295
01:18:47,201 --> 01:18:51,372
spend their nights and dawns

1296
01:18:52,289 --> 01:18:54,375
full of hunger

1297
01:18:54,458 --> 01:18:56,126
they keep walking

1298
01:18:56,543 --> 01:18:58,796
and navigating the world

1299
01:18:58,879 --> 01:19:01,382
that changes and keeps changing

1300
01:19:01,465 --> 01:19:03,801
navigating a world

1301
01:19:03,884 --> 01:19:06,595
that changes and keeps changing

1302
01:19:07,972 --> 01:19:11,350
two caterpillars stop the wind

1303
01:19:12,559 --> 01:19:16,855
as they hold each other with warmth and consent

1304
01:19:17,606 --> 01:19:21,735
keep growing they don't know when

1305
01:19:21,819 --> 01:19:24,154
to find some corner shelter

1306
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:26,824
the time keeps changing

1307
01:19:26,907 --> 01:19:29,076
they are inseparable

1308
01:19:29,326 --> 01:19:31,662
and the weather keeps changing

1309
01:19:33,372 --> 01:19:34,999
Oh, caterpillars

1310
01:19:35,332 --> 01:19:37,668
don't hold each other any longer

1311
01:19:37,751 --> 01:19:40,421
you must grow apart and return

1312
01:19:40,504 --> 01:19:42,339
that's the way fon/vard

1313
01:19:42,464 --> 01:19:44,675
miracles are coming

1314
01:19:45,009 --> 01:19:47,720
chrysalises are coming

1315
01:19:47,803 --> 01:19:48,971
you must part

1316
01:19:49,054 --> 01:19:52,308
and construct your own future

1317
01:19:52,725 --> 01:19:54,810
oh, caterpillars

1318
01:19:55,352 --> 01:19:57,771
don't hold each other any longer

1319
01:19:57,855 --> 01:20:00,691
you must grow apart and return

1320
01:20:00,774 --> 01:20:02,860
that's the way fon/vard

1321
01:20:02,943 --> 01:20:04,945
miracles are coming

1322
01:20:05,529 --> 01:20:07,906
chrysalises are coming

1323
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:09,241
you must part

1324
01:20:09,325 --> 01:20:13,078
and construct your own future

1325
01:20:34,266 --> 01:20:35,934
Two caterpillars

1326
01:20:37,353 --> 01:20:38,604
disoriented

1327
01:20:40,022 --> 01:20:42,149
in two cocoons

1328
01:20:43,525 --> 01:20:45,319
all bundled up

1329
01:20:46,945 --> 01:20:49,156
abuela: I was given a miracle.

1330
01:20:51,367 --> 01:20:53,619
A second chance.

1331
01:20:57,664 --> 01:21:00,667
And I was so afraid to lose it

1332
01:21:03,587 --> 01:21:08,384
that I lost sight of who our miracle was for.

1333
01:21:11,387 --> 01:21:15,682
And I am so sorry.

1334
01:21:17,559 --> 01:21:21,146
You never hurt our family, mirabel.

1335
01:21:22,689 --> 01:21:24,024
We are broken...

1336
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,280
Because of me.

1337
01:21:44,503 --> 01:21:46,130
Mirabel: Abuela.

1338
01:21:47,881 --> 01:21:49,842
I can finally see.

1339
01:21:54,179 --> 01:21:56,974
You lost your home.

1340
01:21:58,851 --> 01:22:01,311
Lost everything.

1341
01:22:03,147 --> 01:22:05,816
You suffered so much,

1342
01:22:05,983 --> 01:22:07,818
all alone,

1343
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:11,613
so it would never happen again.

1344
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:17,035
We were saved because of you.

1345
01:22:17,911 --> 01:22:21,790
We were given a miracle, because of you.

1346
01:22:22,708 --> 01:22:26,628
We are a family, because of you.

1347
01:22:27,421 --> 01:22:30,549
And nothing could ever be broken

1348
01:22:30,716 --> 01:22:34,511
that we can't fix... together.

1349
01:22:39,558 --> 01:22:42,478
I asked my Pedro for help.

1350
01:22:44,646 --> 01:22:46,190
Mirabel.

1351
01:22:48,358 --> 01:22:50,486
He sent me you.

1352
01:22:56,575 --> 01:22:59,077
Man: Oh, butterflies

1353
01:22:59,661 --> 01:23:02,080
don't hold each other any longer

1354
01:23:02,164 --> 01:23:04,917
you must grow apart and return

1355
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,461
that's the way fon/vard

1356
01:23:07,586 --> 01:23:09,421
you are already miracles

1357
01:23:09,546 --> 01:23:12,174
breaking chrysalises

1358
01:23:12,257 --> 01:23:13,842
you must fly

1359
01:23:13,926 --> 01:23:17,971
and find your own future

1360
01:23:20,265 --> 01:23:22,601
Bruno: She didn't do this! Whoa!

1361
01:23:23,143 --> 01:23:25,062
She didn't do this!

1362
01:23:25,395 --> 01:23:28,607
I gave her a vision!

1363
01:23:29,525 --> 01:23:31,485
It was me!

1364
01:23:31,652 --> 01:23:34,029
I was, like, "go!" And she was, like...

1365
01:23:34,154 --> 01:23:36,073
She only wanted to help.

1366
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:37,574
I don't care

1367
01:23:37,658 --> 01:23:39,785
what you think of me, but if you're

1368
01:23:39,868 --> 01:23:41,620
- too stubborn to... -

1369
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:43,372
Brunito.

1370
01:23:44,498 --> 01:23:48,919
I feel like I missed something important.

1371
01:23:49,711 --> 01:23:51,004
Come on.

1372
01:23:58,303 --> 01:24:01,348
What... what's happening? Where are we going?

1373
01:24:01,932 --> 01:24:04,434
- Home. -

1374
01:24:10,732 --> 01:24:12,359
It's her! I found her!

1375
01:24:12,526 --> 01:24:13,902
I found her!

1376
01:24:14,069 --> 01:24:16,113
She's back! She's back, she's back!

1377
01:24:27,165 --> 01:24:28,417
Julieta: Mirabel!

1378
01:24:31,461 --> 01:24:32,671
Mirabel!

1379
01:24:34,089 --> 01:24:35,090
Mama'.

1380
01:24:36,049 --> 01:24:37,467
Mi amor, I was so worried.

1381
01:24:37,634 --> 01:24:39,177
We couldn't find you.

1382
01:24:39,595 --> 01:24:42,139
There were bees everywhere.

1383
01:24:44,057 --> 01:24:45,309
I'll be okay.

1384
01:24:45,726 --> 01:24:48,812
Uh... not if we don't have a house.

1385
01:24:48,979 --> 01:24:50,188
What? We don't have a house.

1386
01:24:50,272 --> 01:24:51,624
I can't say we don't have a house?

1387
01:24:51,648 --> 01:24:53,066
What is that? Not a house.

1388
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:05,579
Look at this home we need a new foundation

1389
01:25:05,746 --> 01:25:09,875
it may seem hopeless but we 'ii get by just fine

1390
01:25:10,042 --> 01:25:14,421
look at this family a glowing constellation

1391
01:25:14,588 --> 01:25:19,384
so full of stars and everybody wants to shine

1392
01:25:20,636 --> 01:25:25,140
but the stars don't shine they burn

1393
01:25:25,515 --> 01:25:28,644
and the constellations shift

1394
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:34,316
I think it's time you learn

1395
01:25:34,483 --> 01:25:37,736
you're more than just your gift

1396
01:25:37,903 --> 01:25:41,365
and I'm sorry I held on too tight

1397
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:46,161
just so afraid I'd lose you too

1398
01:25:46,328 --> 01:25:49,956
the miracle is not some magic that you've got

1399
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,833
- - The miracle is you

1400
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,670
not some gift just you

1401
01:25:54,836 --> 01:25:56,171
the miracle is you

1402
01:25:56,338 --> 01:25:58,548
all of you all of you

1403
01:25:58,924 --> 01:26:02,552
okay so we gonna talk about Bruno?

1404
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:03,929
That's Bruno?

1405
01:26:04,096 --> 01:26:05,681
Yeah there's a lot to say

1406
01:26:05,764 --> 01:26:07,099
about Bruno

1407
01:26:07,182 --> 01:26:08,225
I 'ii start, okay

1408
01:26:08,308 --> 01:26:09,369
pepa, I'm sorry about your wedding

1409
01:26:09,393 --> 01:26:10,473
didn't mean to be upsetting

1410
01:26:10,519 --> 01:26:11,561
that wasn't a prophecy

1411
01:26:11,645 --> 01:26:12,705
I could just see you were sweating

1412
01:26:12,729 --> 01:26:14,666
and I wanted you to know that your bro loves you so

1413
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:16,459
let it in, let it out let it rain, let it snow

1414
01:26:16,483 --> 01:26:17,484
let it go

1415
01:26:17,567 --> 01:26:18,927
that's what I'm always saying, bro

1416
01:26:19,069 --> 01:26:20,654
I got a lot of apologies I got to say

1417
01:26:20,862 --> 01:26:22,989
hey, we're just happy that you're here, okay?

1418
01:26:23,156 --> 01:26:25,036
-Come into the light -that trip was only a night

1419
01:26:25,117 --> 01:26:27,285
and no matter what happens we're gonna find our way

1420
01:26:27,452 --> 01:26:29,579
yo, I knew he never left I heard him every day

1421
01:26:32,708 --> 01:26:34,710
What's that sound?

1422
01:26:35,585 --> 01:26:37,754
I think it's everyone in town

1423
01:26:39,256 --> 01:26:40,257
all: Hey

1424
01:26:40,382 --> 01:26:44,261
lay down your load lay down your load

1425
01:26:44,428 --> 01:26:48,014
roll me down the road roll me down the road

1426
01:26:48,890 --> 01:26:52,310
we have no gifts but we are many

1427
01:26:53,061 --> 01:26:56,523
and we'll do anything for you

1428
01:26:56,690 --> 01:26:59,943
it's a dream when we work as a team

1429
01:27:00,026 --> 01:27:01,111
you're so strong

1430
01:27:01,278 --> 01:27:04,865
-yeah, but sometimes I cry -both: So do I

1431
01:27:05,031 --> 01:27:07,117
I may not be as strong but I'm getting wiser

1432
01:27:07,284 --> 01:27:09,035
yeah, ineed sunlight and fertiliser

1433
01:27:09,202 --> 01:27:10,471
come on let's plant something new

1434
01:27:10,495 --> 01:27:11,705
and watch it fly

1435
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:13,415
straight up to the sky

1436
01:27:13,582 --> 01:27:15,167
let's go

1437
01:27:15,333 --> 01:27:19,129
the stars don't shine they burn

1438
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:22,924
the constellations glow

1439
01:27:23,508 --> 01:27:27,053
the seasons change in turn

1440
01:27:27,763 --> 01:27:30,599
would you watch our little girl go

1441
01:27:30,766 --> 01:27:33,018
she takes after you

1442
01:27:34,436 --> 01:27:36,980
Hey, Mariano why so blue?

1443
01:27:38,064 --> 01:27:41,902
I just have so much love inside

1444
01:27:42,903 --> 01:27:44,988
you know I've got this cousin too

1445
01:27:45,071 --> 01:27:46,907
have you met Dolores?

1446
01:27:47,532 --> 01:27:49,284
Okay, I'll take it from here. Goodbye!

1447
01:27:49,743 --> 01:27:50,952
You talk so loud

1448
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:52,805
you take care of your mother and you make her proud

1449
01:27:52,829 --> 01:27:53,830
you write your own poetry

1450
01:27:53,914 --> 01:27:55,016
every night when you go to sleep

1451
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,082
and I'm seizing the moment

1452
01:27:56,166 --> 01:27:57,486
so would you wake up and notice me

1453
01:27:57,584 --> 01:27:59,836
Dolores, I see you.

1454
01:28:00,003 --> 01:28:01,797
- And I hear you. - Both: Yes!

1455
01:28:01,963 --> 01:28:03,965
Chorus: All of you all of you

1456
01:28:04,132 --> 01:28:05,842
- let's get married. - Slow down.

1457
01:28:06,009 --> 01:28:08,261
Chorus: All of you all of you

1458
01:28:09,930 --> 01:28:14,017
home sweet home I like the new foundation

1459
01:28:14,184 --> 01:28:16,019
it isn't perfect

1460
01:28:16,186 --> 01:28:18,104
-neither are we -that's true

1461
01:28:18,271 --> 01:28:21,983
just one more thing before the celebration

1462
01:28:22,192 --> 01:28:24,236
- what? - We need a doorknob

1463
01:28:24,694 --> 01:28:26,029
we made this one for you.

1464
01:28:37,082 --> 01:28:40,794
All: We see how bright you burn

1465
01:28:43,797 --> 01:28:47,926
we see how brave you've been

1466
01:28:50,554 --> 01:28:54,140
now see yourself in turn

1467
01:28:56,810 --> 01:28:59,521
you're the real gift, kid let us in

1468
01:29:00,730 --> 01:29:03,024
open your eyes

1469
01:29:08,822 --> 01:29:10,323
What do you see?

1470
01:29:12,701 --> 01:29:15,996
I see... me.

1471
01:29:18,707 --> 01:29:20,375
All of me

1472
01:30:02,042 --> 01:30:05,337
