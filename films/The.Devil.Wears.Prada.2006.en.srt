1
00:01:57,032 --> 00:01:58,034
Good luck.

2
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:41,615
Hi. Uh, I have an appointment with Emily Charlton?

3
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,213
- Andrea Sachs? - Yes.

4
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,817
Great. Human Resources certainly has an odd sense of humor.

5
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,896
Follow me.

6
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,133
Okay, so I was Miranda's second assistant...

7
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,363
but her first assistant recently got promoted, and so now I'm the first.

8
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,769
- Oh, and you're replacing yourself. - Well, I am trying.

9
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,273
Miranda sacked the last two girls after only a few weeks.

10
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,776
We need to find someone who can survive here. Do you understand?

11
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,812
Yeah. Of course. Who's Miranda?

12
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,213
Oh, my God. I will pretend you did not just ask me that.

13
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,150
She's the editor in chief of Runway, not to mention a legend.

14
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,247
You work a year for her, and you can get a job at any magazine you want.

15
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,690
A million girls would kill for this job.

16
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,591
It sounds like a great opportunity. I'd love to be considered.

17
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:29,568
Andrea, Runway is a fashion magazine...

18
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,638
so an interest in fashion is crucial.

19
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,105
What makes you think I'm not interested in fashion?

20
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,109
Oh, my God.

21
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,112
No! No! No!

22
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,375
What's wrong?

23
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,384
She's on her way. Tell everyone!

24
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,959
She's not supposed to be here until 9:00.

25
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,029
Her driver just text messaged, and her facialist ruptured a disk.

26
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,327
- God, these people! - Who's that?

27
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,630
That I can't even talk about.

28
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,227
All right, everyone! Gird your loins!

29
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,002
Did somebody eat an onion bagel?

30
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,771
Sorry, Miranda.

31
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,547
Move it! Ooh!

32
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,747
I don't understand why it's so difficult to confirm an appointment.

33
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,826
I know. I'm so sorry, Miranda. I actually did confirm last night.

34
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,053
Details of your incompetence do not interest me.

35
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:39,996
Tell Simone I'm not going to approve that girl that she sent me for the Brazilian layout.

36
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:43,660
I asked for clean, athletic, smiling. She sent me dirty, tired and paunchy.

37
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,738
And R.S.V.P. yes to the Michael Kors party.

38
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:49,831
I want the driver to drop me off at 9:30 and pick me up at 9:45 sharp.

39
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:54,174
- 9:45 sharp. - Call Natalie at Glorious Foods, tell her no for the 40th time.

40
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,374
No, I don't want dacquoise. I want tortes filled with warm rhubarb compote.

41
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,782
Then call my ex-husband and remind him the parent-teacher conference is at Dalton tonight.

42
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:05,347
Then call my husband, ask him to meet me for dinner at that place I went to with Massimo.

43
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:10,122
Tell Richard I saw the pictures that he sent for that feature on the female paratroopers...

44
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,026
and they're all so deeply unattractive.

45
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:15,328
Is it impossible to find a lovely, slender female paratrooper?

46
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,166
- No. - Am I reaching for the stars here? Not really.

47
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:24,141
Also, I need to see all the things that Nigel has pulled for Gwyneth's second cover try.

48
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:27,110
I wonder if she's lost any of that weight yet. Who's that?

49
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,511
Nobody. Um, uh-

50
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:33,949
Human Resources sent her up about the new assistant job, and I was pre-interviewing her.

51
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,954
But she's hopeless and totally wrong for it.

52
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,957
Clearly I'm going to have to do that myself because the last two you sent me...

53
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,959
were completely inadequate.

54
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:45,462
So send her in. That's all.

55
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,734
Right.

56
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,864
- She wants to see you. - Oh! She does?

57
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,873
Move!

58
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,640
- This is foul. Don't let her see it. Go! - That's-

59
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,419
Who are you?

60
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,118
Uh, my name is Andy Sachs.

61
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,219
I recently graduated from Northwestern University.

62
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,026
And what are you doing here?

63
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:24,592
Well, I think I could do a good job as your assistant.

64
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:28,037
And, um-

65
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,406
Yeah, I came to New York to be a journalist and sent letters out everywhere...

66
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,776
and then finally got a call from Elias-Clarke...

67
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,509
and met with Sherry up at Human Resources.

68
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,950
Basically, it's this or Auto Universe.

69
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:45,456
- So you don't read Runway? - Uh, no.

70
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:49,085
And before today, you had never heard of me.

71
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,095
No.

72
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,360
And you have no style or sense of fashion.

73
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:59,268
Well, um, I think that depends on what you're-

74
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,739
No, no. That wasn't a question.

75
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:09,239
Um, I was editor in chief of the Daily Northwestern.

76
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:13,808
I also, um, won a national competition for college journalists...

77
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,787
with my series on the janitors' union, which exposed the exploitation-

78
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,255
That's all.

79
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,522
Yeah. You know, okay.

80
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,601
You're right. I don't fit in here.

81
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,830
I am not skinny or glamorous...

82
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,134
and I don't know that much about fashion.

83
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,732
But I'm smart.

84
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,868
I learn fast and I will work very hard.

85
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,447
I got the exclusive on the Cavalli for Gwyneth...

86
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,915
but the problem is, with that huge feathered headdress that she's wearing...

87
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,612
she looks like she's working the main stage at the Golden Nugget.

88
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:52,452
Thank you for your time.

89
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,391
Who is that sad little person?

90
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:58,463
Are we doing a before-and-after piece I don't know about?

91
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,437
Brown and Law, please? Thank you.

92
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,800
- Andrea. - Hmm?

93
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,882
Wait. You got a job at a fashion magazine?

94
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,952
- Mm-hmm. - What was it, a phone interview?

95
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:23,488
- Wow. - Ow! Don't be a jerk.

96
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,717
Miranda Priestly is famous for being unpredictable.

97
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,795
Okay, Doug. How is it that you know who she is and I didn't?

98
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,363
- I'm actually a girl. - Oh!

99
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,696
- That would explain so much. - Look, seriously.

100
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,634
Miranda Priestly is a huge deal. I bet a million girls would kill for that job.

101
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,571
Yeah, great. The thing is I'm not one of them.

102
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,142
Look, you gotta start somewhere, right?

103
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,234
I mean, look at this dump Nate works in.

104
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:49,041
I mean, come on. Paper napkins? Hello.

105
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,777
Yeah. And Lily, she works at that gallery doing, uh, you know-

106
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:56,082
Oh, I'm sorry. What exactly is it that you do anyway?

107
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,385
Well, lucky for me, I already have my dream job.

108
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,189
You're a corporate research analyst!

109
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,059
- Oh, you're right. My job sucks. - No!

110
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,099
- It sucks. I don't- It's boring. - It's all right. Breathe.

111
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,100
- I'm trying. - Here. Take a drink.

112
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,103
- I will have a drink. I will have a drink. - Ah, yes.

113
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:16,436
- I'd like to propose a toast. To jobs that pay the rent. - To jobs that pay the rent.

114
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,601
Jobs that pay the rent.

115
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,272
Oh, baby. You should see the way these girls at Runway dress.

116
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,611
I don't have a thing to wear to work.

117
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:27,185
Come on. You're gonna be answering phones and getting coffee.

118
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,379
You need a ball gown for that?

119
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,615
I think I might.

120
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:35,091
Well, I happen to think you look great always.

121
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,288
Aww! I think you're full of it.

122
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,025
- Hey. Come on. Let's go home. - Yeah.

123
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:46,229
I can think of something we can do that doesn't require any clothing.

124
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,238
- Really? - Mmm.

125
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,710
Hello?

126
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,251
Andrea, Miranda decided to kill the autumn jacket story for September...

127
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:02,479
and she is pulling up the Sedona shoot from October.

128
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:06,490
You need to come into the office right this second and pick up her coffee order on the way.

129
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,393
- Now? - Now, get a pen and write this down.

130
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:13,226
I want one no-foam skimmed latte with an extra shot...

131
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,323
and three drip coffees with room for milk.

132
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,426
Searing hot. And I mean hot.

133
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,074
Hello?

134
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:27,577
- Where are you? - Oh, I'm almost there. Yeah.

135
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,580
Shoot! Oh!

136
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,620
Is there some reason that my coffee isn't here?

137
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,656
Has she died or something?

138
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,226
No. God.

139
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,656
Oh. Bloody time.

140
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:52,534
- I hope you know that this is a very difficult job- - Mm-hmm.

141
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,538
for which you are totally wrong.

142
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,200
And if you mess up, my head is on the chopping block.

143
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,107
Now, hang that up. Don't just fling it anywhere.

144
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,989
Okay. First of all, you and I answer the phones.

145
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:16,152
The phone must be answered every single time it rings.

146
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,288
Calls roll to voice mail, and she gets very upset.

147
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,662
If I'm not here-Andrea, Andrea-

148
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,894
you are chained to that desk.

149
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:27,200
- Well, what if I need to- - What? No.

150
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:31,174
One time an assistant left the desk because she sliced her hand open with a letter opener...

151
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,075
and Miranda missed Lagerfeld...

152
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,808
just before he boarded a 17-hour flight to Australia.

153
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,884
She now works at TVGuide.

154
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,388
Man the desk at all times. Got it.

155
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,926
- Uh- - Miranda Priestly's office.

156
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,995
No, she's not available.

157
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,756
Who is it?

158
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:58,029
Yes, I will tell her you called... yet again.

159
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:01,664
- Right. Remember, you and I have totally different jobs.

160
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,572
I mean, you get coffee- and you run errands.

161
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,168
Yet I am in charge of her schedule...

162
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,406
her appointments and her expenses.

163
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,449
And, um, most importantly, um...

164
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,917
I get to go with her to Paris for Fashion Week in the fall.

165
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,148
I get to wear couture. I go to all the shows and all the parties.

166
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,226
I meet all of the designers. It's divine.

167
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:25,423
Okay. Now, stay here. I'm going to the art department to give them the Book.

168
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,968
- The- - This is the Book.

169
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,867
Now, it is a mock-up of everything...

170
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,940
in the current issue.

171
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,838
And we deliver it to Miranda's apartment every night, and she retu-

172
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,912
Don't touch it. She returns it to us in the morning with her notes.

173
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:44,244
Now, the second assistant is supposed to do this...

174
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,218
but Miranda is very private and she does not like strangers in her house.

175
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,289
So until she decides that you are not a total psycho...

176
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,722
I get the lovely task of waiting around for the Book.

177
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:57,492
Oh, Emily? What do I do-

178
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,928
Deal with it.

179
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,163
Hello. Mrs. Priestly's office.

180
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,299
Hmm. That's what I meant. Miranda Priestly's office.

181
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:16,677
Um, you know, she is in a meeting. Can I please take a message?

182
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:19,307
Uh-huh.

183
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,751
Okay. Can you please spell Gabbana?

184
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:26,256
Hello?

185
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:28,326
I guess not.

186
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,021
I guessed an eight and a half.

187
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,690
Um, uh, that's very nice of you...

188
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,563
but I don't think I need these.

189
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,160
Miranda hired me. She knows what I look like.

190
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,569
Do you?

191
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,873
Emily.

192
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,447
Emily?

193
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,516
She means you.

194
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,215
- We just cut on the bias. - That's not what I asked you.

195
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,292
I couldn't have been clearer. There you are, Emily.

196
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:03,361
- How many times do I have to scream your name? - Actually, it's Andy.

197
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:09,825
My name is Andy. Andrea, but, uh, everybody calls me Andy.

198
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:16,266
I need 10 or 15 skirts from Calvin Klein.

199
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:20,471
- What kind of skirts do you- - Please bore someone else with your questions.

200
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:24,174
And make sure we have Pier 59 at 8:00 A.M. tomorrow.

201
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:28,083
Remind Jocelyn I need to see a few of those satchels that Marc is doing in the pony.

202
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:31,554
And then tell Simone I'll take Jackie if Maggie isn't available.

203
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,388
- Did Demarchelier confirm? - D-Did D-Demarchel-

204
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,486
Demarchelier. Did he- Get him on the phone.

205
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,065
Uh, o- okay.

206
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,434
- And, Emily? - Yes?

207
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,072
That's all.

208
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:02,210
It's just the cavalier disregard for clear directions-

209
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,426
Do you have Demarchelier?

210
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,430
Uh, Demarchelier.

211
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:17,059
- Leave it. - Do you have-

212
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,172
I have Miranda Priestly calling.

213
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,207
I have Patrick!

214
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:28,709
Uh, no, she called me in there and-and then she asked me about Pier 59.

215
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:32,614
And there was something about Simone, Frankie, someone else.

216
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,915
And, um, she needs skirts from Calvin Klein.

217
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:39,616
And, uh, there was something about a pony.

218
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,556
- Did she say which skirts? - No. No.

219
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,493
- Did she say what kind? Color, shape, fabric? - I tried to ask her.

220
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,962
You may never ask Miranda anything.

221
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,162
Right. I will deal with all of this, and you will go to Calvin Klein.

222
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,761
Eh- Me?

223
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:56,432
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you have some prior commitment?

224
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,976
Some hideous skirt convention you have to go to?

225
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,978
Uh-

226
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,226
Miranda?

227
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:18,296
- Are you there? - I'm about to walk in. I'll call you as soon as-

228
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,335
- Hello? Hi. - While you're out...

229
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,134
Miranda needs you to go to Hermès to pick up 25 scarves we ordered for her.

230
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,709
- Okay. - Cassidy forgot her homework at Dalton. Pick that up.

231
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,109
Miranda went out to meet with Meisel, and she will want more Starbucks when she gets back.

232
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,682
- Hot Starbucks. - Can you just repeat that first-

233
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,343
Hello?

234
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,189
Oh, my God.

235
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,589
What took you so long? I have to pee!

236
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,662
What? You haven't peed since I left?

237
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:54,220
No, I haven't. I've been manning the desk, haven't I? I'm bursting.

238
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,628
Oh, hi.

239
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,799
You do coat. Do the coat!

240
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,070
Okay.

241
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,669
Now, be prepared. The run-through is at 12:30.

242
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,147
People are panicking, so the phone is going to be ringing off the hook.

243
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,912
The ru-The run-through. Right.

244
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:18,251
Yes. Editors bring in options for the shoot, and Miranda chooses.

245
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,791
She chooses every single thing in every single issue.

246
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,487
Run-throughs are a huge deal. I don't know why you don't know that, Andrea.

247
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:26,223
- Okay. Are you ready? - Oh, hi, hi.

248
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,323
Right. Well, after the loo, Serena and I are going to lunch.

249
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,493
- This is her- the new me. - Hi.

250
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,696
- Told you. - I thought you were kidding.

251
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,865
No, quite serious, yeah. I get 20 minutes for lunch, and you get 15.

252
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,443
- When I come back, you can go. - Okay.

253
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,775
What exactly is she wearing?

254
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,871
Her grandmother's skirt.

255
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,086
Hmm. Corn chowder.

256
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,528
That's an interesting choice.

257
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:04,625
You do know that cellulite is one of the main ingredients in corn chowder.

258
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,271
So none of the girls here eat anything?

259
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:15,972
Not since two became the new four and zero became the new two.

260
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:20,643
- Well, I'm a six. - Which is the new 14.

261
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:24,822
Oh. Shoot.

262
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:28,882
Oh, never mind. I'm sure you have plenty more polyblend where that came from.

263
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:33,488
Okay. You think my clothes are hideous.

264
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,499
I get it.

265
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,069
But, you know, I'm not going to be in fashion forever...

266
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,628
so I don't see the point of changing everything about myself just because I have this job.

267
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,640
Yes, that's true.

268
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:47,542
That's really what this multibillion-dollar industry is all about anyway, isn't it?

269
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:51,776
Inner beauty.

270
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:54,078
Hello.

271
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,154
Right. Come on.

272
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,917
- Miranda's pushed the run-through up a half an hour. - Mmm!

273
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,356
- She's always 15 minutes early. - Which means?

274
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,758
- You're already late. Come. - Shoot!

275
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,330
Excuse me.

276
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,626
Mr. Ravitz.

277
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,861
Nigel.

278
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:14,029
- Issue going well? - Oh, yes. Our best September ever.

279
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:18,701
Great. Heard Miranda killed autumn jackets and pulled up the Sedona shoot.

280
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,679
What's that costing me?

281
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,941
About 300,000.

282
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:27,212
Must have been some lousy jackets.

283
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,719
- Irv Ravitz. - Oh, I'm sorry.

284
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,016
This is Andy Sachs, Miranda's new assistant.

285
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,115
Congratulations, young lady.

286
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,457
A million girls would kill for that job.

287
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,462
Bye-bye.

288
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,761
- Hmm? - Chairman of Elias-Clarke, Irv Ravitz.

289
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:47,635
You know what they say? Tiny man, huge ego.

290
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,173
No. And I've seen all this before.

291
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:56,179
Theyskens is trying to reinvent the drop waist, so actually it's-

292
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:59,341
- Where are all the other dresses? - We have some right here.

293
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:02,682
- Stand, watch and listen. - And I think it can be very interesting-

294
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:07,122
No. No, I just- It's just baffling to me.

295
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,717
Why is it so impossible to put together a decent run-through?

296
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:15,698
You people have had hours and hours to prepare. It's just so confusing to me.

297
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:17,826
Where are the advertisers?

298
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:21,064
- We have some pieces from Banana Republic. - We need more, don't we?

299
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:25,075
- Oh. This is-This might be- What do you think of- - Yeah.

300
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,735
Well, you know me.

301
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,712
Give me a full ballerina skirt and a hint of saloon and I'm on board.

302
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:33,251
- But do you think it's too much like- - Like the Lacroix from July?

303
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,287
I thought that, but no, not with the right accessories. It should work.

304
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:40,916
Where are the belts for this dre- Why is no one ready?

305
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,325
Here. It's a tough call.

306
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,590
- They're so different. - Hmm.

307
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,566
Something funny?

308
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:00,144
No. No, no. Nothing's-

309
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:04,113
You know, it's just that both those belts look exactly the same to me.

310
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:08,380
You know, I'm still learning about this stuff and, uh-

311
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,251
"This... stuff"?

312
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:14,917
Oh. Okay. I see.

313
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,221
You think this has nothing to do with you.

314
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,662
You go to your closet...

315
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:25,430
and you select- I don't know- that lumpy blue sweater, for instance...

316
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,404
because you're trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously...

317
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,873
to care about what you put on your back.

318
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:34,104
But what you don't know is that that sweater is not just blue.

319
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,737
It's not turquoise. It's not lapis.

320
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:39,009
It's actually cerulean.

321
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:41,176
And you're also blithely unaware of the fact...

322
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:45,586
that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns.

323
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,215
And then I think it was Yves Saint Laurent- wasn't it-

324
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,294
who showed cerulean military jackets?

325
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,795
- I think we need a jacket here. - Mmm.

326
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:56,698
And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers.

327
00:23:56,802 --> 00:24:00,033
And then it, uh, filtered down through the department stores...

328
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:04,139
and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner...

329
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:07,437
where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin.

330
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,208
However, that blue represents millions of dollars...

331
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,783
and countless jobs...

332
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,910
and it's sort of comical how you think that you've made a choice...

333
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,989
that exempts you from the fashion industry...

334
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,989
when, in fact...

335
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:24,494
you're wearing a sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room...

336
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:27,326
from a pile of stuff.

337
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,059
So then I said, "No, I couldn't see the difference...

338
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:32,466
between the two absolutely identical belts"...

339
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,539
and you should have seen the look she gave me!

340
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,698
I thought the flesh was gonna melt off her face.

341
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,368
It's not funny.

342
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,676
She's not happy unless everyone around her is panicked, nauseous or suicidal.

343
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,717
And the Clackers just worship her.

344
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,718
- The who? - They call them Clackers.

345
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,119
The sound that their stilettos make in the marble lobby.

346
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,192
It's like, "Clack, clack, clack. clack, clack."

347
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:58,023
And they all act like they're curing cancer or something.

348
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,690
The amount of time and energy...

349
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,203
that these people spend on these insignificant, minute details, and for what?

350
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,899
So that tomorrow they can spend another $300,000 reshooting something...

351
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,999
that was probably fine to begin with...

352
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,908
to sell people things they don't need!

353
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,073
God!

354
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,414
- I'm not even hungry anymore. - What?

355
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,421
- That is why those girls are so skinny. - Oh. No, no, no.

356
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,014
Give me that. There's, like, eight dollars of Jarlsberg in there.

357
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:30,151
You know what?

358
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,355
I just have to stick it out for a year. One year.

359
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:37,094
And then I can do what I came to New York to do.

360
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,467
But I can't let Miranda get to me. I won't.

361
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,540
Easy there, tiger.

362
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,873
- Oh, good morning, Miranda. - Get me Isaac.

363
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,877
I don't see my breakfast here. Are my eggs here? Where are my eggs?

364
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,644
Excuse me!

365
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,778
Pick up the Polaroids from the lingerie shoot.

366
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,415
Have the brakes checked on my car.

367
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:06,125
Where's that piece of paper I had in my hand yesterday morning?

368
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:11,168
The girls need new surfboards or boogie boards or something for spring break.

369
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:14,500
- Hello. - The twins also need flip-flops.

370
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:17,503
- Ow! - Oh, my gosh!

371
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:21,636
Pick up my shoes from Blahnik, and then go get Patricia.

372
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,579
- Who's that? - Good girl! Good girl! Good girl!

373
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:28,414
Get me that little table that I liked at that store on Madison.

374
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,648
Get us a reservation for dinner tonight at that place that got the good review.

375
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,418
- Get me Isaac. - Thirty-six thank-you notes delivered today.

376
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,517
- Where is everyone? - Why is no one working?

377
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,763
Get me Demarchelier.

378
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:50,607
I have Miranda Priestly calling for- Okay.

379
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,579
I have Patrick.

380
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:02,118
Thank God it's Friday, right?

381
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,816
At least Miranda will be in Miami, so we don't have to be on call this weekend.

382
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,893
You know, my dad's coming in from Ohio.

383
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:11,622
Yeah, we're gonna go out to dinner, maybe see Chicago.

384
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,789
You doing anything fun this weekend?

385
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:16,230
Yes.

386
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:22,200
Yeah, Nate said it was great.

387
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:26,175
He actually- He applied here, but they wanted someone with more experience.

388
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,177
- Here. - Huh? What's this?

389
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,077
I don't want you to get behind on your rent.

390
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:34,049
- Dad, how did you- - It's-

391
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:37,019
I'm gonna kill Mom.

392
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,090
Dad, thank you.

393
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,885
Mm-hmm.

394
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,256
- It's really good to see you. - You too, honey.

395
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:50,300
So, you want to start grilling me now...

396
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,597
or should we wait till after dinner?

397
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,935
I thought I'd let you at least enjoy the bread basket first.

398
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,838
No, no, no. It's okay. Go right ahead.

399
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,376
We're just a little worried, honey.

400
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:03,106
We get e-mails from you at your office at 2:00 A.M.

401
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,944
Your pay is terrible. You don't get to write anything.

402
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:08,042
Hey, that's not fair.

403
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,485
I wrote those e-mails.

404
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,887
I'm just trying to understand why someone who got accepted to Stanford Law...

405
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:17,792
turns it down to be a journalist, and now you're not even doing that.

406
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:21,024
Dad, you have to trust me.

407
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,896
Being Miranda's assistant opens a lot of doors.

408
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:27,563
Emily is going to Paris with Miranda in a few months...

409
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:31,472
and she's gonna meet editors and writers from every important magazine.

410
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,544
And in a year, that could be me.

411
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:36,113
- All right? - Mm-hmm.

412
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,910
Dad, I swear, this is my break.

413
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,451
This is my- my chance.

414
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,647
This is my boss.

415
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,852
- I'm sorry, Dad. I have to take this. - Take it. Take it.

416
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,124
- Hello. Miranda? - My flight has been canceled.

417
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,426
It's some absurd weather problem.

418
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:59,435
I need to get home tonight. The twins have a recital tomorrow morning at school.

419
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,437
- What? - At school!

420
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:03,803
- Absolutely. Let me see what I can do. - Good.

421
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,843
Hi. Um, I know this is totally last minute...

422
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:09,846
but I was hoping that you could maybe get a flight for my boss...

423
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,916
from Miami to New York tonight?

424
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,916
Uh-

425
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,282
- It's right here. Thank you. - Yeah, any kind of jet.

426
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,287
- From Miami to New York. - Thank you.

427
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:20,289
- Yup, I need it tonight. I need it- - Ow!

428
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,325
- I thought you were going out the other- - Sweetie! No.

429
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,327
- It's over here, honey. - Tonight.

430
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:29,264
Hi. I'm trying to get a flight tonight- for tonight- from Miami to New York.

431
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,666
Yes, I know there's a hurricane.

432
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,433
Nothing is flying out? What do you mean, nothing is flying out?

433
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,998
It's for Miranda Priestly, and I know that she's a client of yours.

434
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:43,342
Yes. Yes, hi. I need a jet tonight from Miami to New York.

435
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:47,282
Yeah. Sorry. Hold on. Hello? Miranda, hi.

436
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:50,946
I'm trying to get you a flight, but no one is flying out because of the weather.

437
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:54,024
Please. It's just- I don't know- drizzling.

438
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,719
Someone must be getting out.

439
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:58,728
Call Donatella. Get her jet.

440
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,298
Call everybody else that we know that has a jet. Irv?

441
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,027
Call every- This is your responsibi- This is your job.

442
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,069
Get me home.

443
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,867
Oh, my God! She's going to murder me.

444
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,602
What does she want you to do, call the National Guard and have her airlifted out of there?

445
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,735
Of course not. Could I do that?

446
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,074
Come on.

447
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,078
Come on.

448
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:21,550
The girls' recital was absolutely wonderful.

449
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,848
They played Rachmaninoff. Everyone loved it.

450
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,116
Everyone except me...

451
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:30,354
because, sadly, I was not there.

452
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,793
Miranda, I'm so sorry.

453
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,865
Do you know why I hired you?

454
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:38,060
I always hire the same girl-

455
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,605
stylish, slender, of course...

456
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,606
worships the magazine.

457
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,768
But so often, they turn out to be-

458
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:50,279
I don't know- disappointing and, um...

459
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,281
stupid.

460
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:57,377
So you, with that impressive résumé...

461
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,582
and the big speech about your so-called work ethic-

462
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,593
I, um- I thought you would be different.

463
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,289
I said to myself, go ahead.

464
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,957
Take a chance.

465
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,366
Hire the smart, fat girl.

466
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:15,371
I had hope.

467
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:18,599
My God. I live on it.

468
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,942
Anyway, you ended up disappointing me more than, um-

469
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,914
more than any of the other silly girls.

470
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,480
Um, I really did everything I could think of.

471
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,957
- Uh- - That's all.

472
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,902
Excuse me! Where do you think you're going?

473
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:10,290
She hates me, Nigel.

474
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,454
And that's my problem because-

475
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,588
Oh, wait. No, it's not my problem.

476
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:19,033
I don't know what else I can do because if I do something right, it's unacknowledged.

477
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,105
She doesn't even say thank you.

478
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:25,505
But if I do something wrong, she is vicious.

479
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:30,241
- So quit. - What?

480
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:32,316
- Quit. - Quit?

481
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:36,945
I can get another girl to take your job in five minutes- one who really wants it.

482
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:39,580
No, I don't want to quit. That's not fair.

483
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:43,991
But, you know, I'm just saying that I would just like a little credit...

484
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:46,563
for the fact that I'm killing myself trying.

485
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,132
Andy, be serious.

486
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,633
You are not trying.

487
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:54,500
- You are whining. - I-

488
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:57,301
What is it that you want me to say to you, huh?

489
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:02,368
Do you want me to say, "Poor you. Miranda's picking on you. Poor you. Poor Andy"?

490
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,812
Hmm? Wake up, six.

491
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,407
She's just doing her job.

492
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,850
Don't you know that you are working at the place...

493
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:12,388
that published some of the greatest artists of the century?

494
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,948
Halston, Lagerfeld, de la Renta.

495
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,393
And what they did, what they created...

496
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:23,263
was greater than art because you live your life in it.

497
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:28,902
Well, not you, obviously, but some people.

498
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,635
You think this is just a magazine, hmm?

499
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,711
This is not just a magazine.

500
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:38,248
This is a shining beacon of hope for-

501
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,317
oh, I don't know-

502
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:43,387
let's say a young boy growing up in Rhode Island with six brothers...

503
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:46,616
pretending to go to soccer practice when he was really going to sewing class...

504
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:50,057
and reading Runway under the covers at night with a flashlight.

505
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,629
You have no idea how many legends have walked these halls.

506
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,925
And what's worse, you don't care.

507
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,935
Because this place, where so many people would die to work...

508
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,131
you only deign to work.

509
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,698
And you want to know why she doesn't kiss you on the forehead...

510
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:10,270
and give you a gold star on your homework at the end of the day.

511
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,283
Wake up, sweetheart.

512
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:23,290
- Okay. So I'm screwing it up. - Mmm.

513
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,658
I don't want to.

514
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:28,459
I just wish that I knew what I could do to-

515
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,138
- Nigel? - Hmm?

516
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,140
Nigel, Nigel.

517
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,677
No.

518
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,906
I don't know what you expect me to do.

519
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:48,645
There's nothing in this whole closet that'll fit a size six.

520
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,278
I can guarantee you.

521
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,847
These are all sample sizes- two and four.

522
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:59,123
- All right. We're doing this for you. And- - A poncho?

523
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,790
You'll take what I give you and you'll like it.

524
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,959
- We're doing this Dolce for you. - Hmm!

525
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:07,469
And shoes.

526
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:11,008
- Jimmy Choo's. - Hmm.

527
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,169
- Manolo Blahnik. - Wow.

528
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,838
Nancy Gonzalez. Love that.

529
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,314
Okay, Narciso Rodriguez. This we love.

530
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:23,148
- Uh, it might fit. It might. - What?

531
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:26,883
Okay. Now, Chanel. You're in desperate need of Chanel. Darling, shall we?

532
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:31,155
We have to get to the beauty department, and God knows how long that's going to take.

533
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,989
I mean, I have no idea why Miranda hired her.

534
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,898
Me neither. The other day, we were in the beauty department.

535
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:42,530
She held up the Shu Uemura eyelash curler and said, "What is this?"

536
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,536
I just knew from the moment I saw her...

537
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,478
she was going to be a complete and utter disas-

538
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,884
Miranda Priestly's office.

539
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:06,395
No, actually, she's not available, but I'll leave word.

540
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:10,263
Okay, thanks. Bye.

541
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,336
How did-

542
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:15,906
- Are you wearing the- - The Chanel boots?

543
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,601
Yeah, I am.

544
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,677
You look good.

545
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:24,580
- Oh, God. - What?

546
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,176
- She does. - Oh, shut up, Serena.

547
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:34,517
- See you guys tomorrow. - Good night, man. Take it easy.

548
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,752
Take care of that finger, huh?

549
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:58,071
So, what do you think?

550
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:01,982
Uh, I think we better get out of here...

551
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:05,544
before my girlfriend sees me.

552
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:54,665
The gowns are fabulous.

553
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:58,139
Mm-hmm. We're gonna use the burgundy.

554
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:08,980
Gotta find-

555
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:12,554
So we spent a whole semester on potatoes alone.

556
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:14,488
You take the fry and squeeze it.

557
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:17,527
- See how firm that is? - Hey. Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.

558
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:21,128
There was a crisis in the accessories department.

559
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:24,224
- I needed to find a python headband. - Python's hot right now.

560
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:28,032
I have exciting presents for all of you.

561
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,835
Are you ready?

562
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:34,502
- What is that? - It's a Bang & Olufsen phone.

563
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,342
Charlie Rose sent it to Miranda for her birthday.

564
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:40,576
I looked it up on line. It's $1,100.

565
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,380
- What? - Wow!

566
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,751
And I have some products. Mason Pearson hairbrushes.

567
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:48,256
- A little Clinique. - Ooh!

568
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,817
- Oh, damn it. I love your job. - Oh! One more.

569
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,989
A little thing.

570
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,000
- Do you want it? You want- Oh. - Gimme! Gimme, gimme, gimme!

571
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:01,003
- I think she likes it. - Oh, my God! This is the new Marc Jacobs!

572
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,573
This is sold out everywhere. Where did you get this?

573
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,074
Miranda didn't want it, so-

574
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:10,170
No, no, no, no, no. This bag is, like, $1,900. I cannot take this from you.

575
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,715
Yeah, you can.

576
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,615
- Why do women need so many bags? - Shut up.

577
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,917
You have one. You put all your junk in it, and that's it. You're done.

578
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,991
Fashion is not about utility.

579
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:23,788
An accessory is merely a piece of iconography...

580
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:25,759
used to express individual identity.

581
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:29,264
- Oh! And it's pretty. - That too.

582
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:33,030
Yeah. But the thing is, it turns out there is more to Runway than just fancy purses.

583
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:37,096
Look, here's an essay by Jay McInerney, a piece by Joan Didion.

584
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,371
Even an interview with Christiane Amanpour.

585
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:43,777
- Looks like someone's been drinking the Kool-Aid. - What do you-

586
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:47,317
I got it. It's-Yup, the Dragon Lady.

587
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,318
- Oh, Miranda? - Let me talk to her.

588
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,411
- I need that. - I'll tell her to get her own scrambled eggs.

589
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:55,253
Lily, no, no, no! Put that thing up! I was gonna answer it!

590
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,260
It's gonna make- Give me the... phone.

591
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:03,333
Hi, Miranda.

592
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:06,460
- Ooh. Shh. - Absolutely.

593
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,664
- Shh! - Uh-huh. I'm leaving right now.

594
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:14,802
You know, you guys didn't have to be such assholes.

595
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,174
Um, excuse me.

596
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,804
I'm looking for James Holt.

597
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:53,406
Um, that's him right there.

598
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:56,145
- Oh. Thanks. - No problem.

599
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,949
- I put my stuff out there, and I pray they improve. - Really?

600
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,251
- Excuse me. - Hi.

601
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,986
I'm Andy. I'm picking up for Miranda Priestly.

602
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:06,722
Oh, yes. You must be the new Emily.

603
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,493
Nice to meet you.

604
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,058
- Oh, let me see that bag. Very, very nice. - Ah.

605
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,606
Distressed, studded leather, pieced by hand, finished with a metallic fringe.

606
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:19,699
Very nice, indeed. Who made that fantastic thing?

607
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,801
You.

608
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:25,905
Hmm. Duh. This way.

609
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,813
Uh, here we go.

610
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:33,253
It's a sketch of Miranda's dress for the benefit.

611
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:36,326
Also the centerpiece of my spring collection. Top secret stuff.

612
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,554
- I'll guard it with my life. - Please do.

613
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,960
Come on. You're working for Miranda Priestly now.

614
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:45,764
You must be in desperate need of hard liquor.

615
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,100
Excuse us, girls.

616
00:41:48,205 --> 00:41:50,264
She'll have the punch.

617
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,843
It's deadly. Have fun.

618
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,786
- He's right, you know. - Hmm?

619
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:06,789
The punch. I drank it at James' last party.

620
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:10,588
I woke up in Hoboken wearing nothing but a poncho and a cowboy hat.

621
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:14,027
Ah. Well.

622
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,395
Wise.

623
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,469
- Uh, hi. - Christian Thompson.

624
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:23,170
Christian Thompson? You're kidding.

625
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:26,869
No, you're-You write for, like, every magazine I love.

626
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:30,435
I actually- I reviewed your collection of essays for my college newspaper.

627
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:34,484
Did you mention my good looks and my killer charm?

628
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,815
- No, but- - What do you do?

629
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:41,483
Oh. Well, I want to work for somewhere like The New Yorker or Vanity Fair.

630
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,560
- I am a writer too. - Is that right?

631
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,755
- Mm-hmm. - I should read your stuff. Why don't you send it over?

632
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,196
Yeah?

633
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,963
That would be-Thank you. That would be great.

634
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,471
But actually, right now, I'm working as Miranda Priestly's assistant.

635
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,974
Oh, you're kidding. Well, that's too bad.

636
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:03,012
That's-Whoa. You'll never survive Miranda.

637
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:08,014
- Excuse me? - Well, you seem nice, smart.

638
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:10,245
You can't do that job.

639
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:14,114
Gotta go.

640
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,124
Okay.

641
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:19,855
Well, it was very, very nice to meet you, Miranda girl.

642
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,746
Emily?

643
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:49,153
Call James Holt's office. Tell them I want to move the preview up to today at 12:30.

644
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:52,057
Tell everybody else. Be ready to leave in half an hour.

645
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:55,825
But we're not expected until Tuesday. Did she say why?

646
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:58,731
Yes. Yeah, she explained every detail of her decision making.

647
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:01,805
And then we brushed each other's hair and gabbed about American Idol.

648
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:03,805
I see your point.

649
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:06,273
- What's a preview anyway? - Good morning, Miranda.

650
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:09,312
Miranda insists upon seeing all the designers' collections...

651
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:11,313
before they show them.

652
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,349
- Great to see you. - Hello, James.

653
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,419
- And she tells them what she thinks? - In her way.

654
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,012
Uh, this season really began for me with a meditation...

655
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:22,752
on the intersection between East and West.

656
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,352
There's a scale. One nod is good. Two nods is very good.

657
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:30,593
There's only been one actual smile on record, and that was Tom Ford in 2001.

658
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,669
An obi belt.

659
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,863
She doesn't like it, she shakes her head.

660
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:38,738
This is the dress that we have designed specifically and exclusively for you.

661
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,709
Then, of course, there's the pursing of the lips.

662
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,677
Which means?

663
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:49,718
Catastrophe.

664
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:53,051
Just, uh-Just go.

665
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:56,854
- I just don't understand. I'm appalled. - It's absurd. Appalled.

666
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,224
- You deal with it. - I'll talk to him.

667
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:03,493
So because she pursed her lips, he's gonna change his entire collection?

668
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,568
You still don't get it, do you?

669
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:08,638
Her opinion is the only one that matters.

670
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,701
- Call my husband and confirm dinner. - At Pastis? Done.

671
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,779
And I'll need a change of clothes.

672
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:20,873
Well, I've already messengered your outfit over to the shoot.

673
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:25,648
Fine. And, Andrea, I would like you to deliver the Book to my home tonight.

674
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:28,247
- Have Emily give you the key. - Mm-hmm.

675
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:32,890
- Guard this with your life. - Of course.

676
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:38,894
You know, if I can deliver the Book, that means I must have done something right.

677
00:45:39,002 --> 00:45:40,902
I'm not a psycho.

678
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,495
Oh, and, you know, she called me Andrea?

679
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:46,235
I mean, she didn't call me Emily, which is- Isn't that great?

680
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,903
Yeah, whoopee. Right.

681
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:54,942
Now, it's very important that you do exactly what I'm about to tell you.

682
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,986
Oh. Okay.

683
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:00,284
The Book is assembled by 10:00, 10:30...

684
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:03,791
and you must wait around for it until then.

685
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:07,421
You will be delivering Miranda's dry cleaning with the Book.

686
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:13,494
Now, the car will take you straight to Miranda's townhouse.

687
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,004
You let yourself in.

688
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:21,738
Andrea. You do not talk to anyone.

689
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,904
Do not look at anyone.

690
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:26,642
This is of the utmost importance. You must be invisible.

691
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,014
- Do you understand? - Uh-huh.

692
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,555
You open the door and you walk across the foyer.

693
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:37,286
You hang the dry cleaning in the closet across from the staircase.

694
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:47,828
- Uh- - And you leave the Book on the table with the flowers.

695
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:59,548
- Shit! - It's that door to the left.

696
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,642
Okay.

697
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:14,155
Thank you.

698
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:18,257
- You can give the Book to us. - Shh. Which-Which table?

699
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:20,928
- It's okay. Come on up. - No, I can't. I can't.

700
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,097
- What? It's okay. - Come on.

701
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,675
- Yeah, come on. It's okay. - Please stop talking.

702
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:29,371
Or you can bring the Book upstairs. Emily does it all the time.

703
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:33,415
She does? Right. She does, all the time.

704
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,577
Yeah? Okay.

705
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:46,729
What did you expect me to do, walk out in the middle of a cover shoot?

706
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,957
I rushed out of an investment committee meeting...

707
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:51,728
and I sat there waiting for you for almost an hour.

708
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:54,326
I told you the cellphones didn't work. Nobody could get a signal out.

709
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:56,565
I knew what everyone in that restaurant was thinking-

710
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:59,403
there he is, waiting for her again.

711
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,126
- Okay, okay! Okay, okay. - Oh, no. Shh!

712
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,431
It really wasn't that big a deal. I promise.

713
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:31,006
The twins said hello, so I said hello back.

714
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:35,067
- Then I went up the stairs to give her the Book and- - You went upstairs?

715
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:38,978
Oh, my God. Why didn't you just climb into bed with her and ask for a bedtime story?

716
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,074
Okay, I made a mistake. I know.

717
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:43,846
Andrea, you don't understand.

718
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:46,923
If you get fired, that might jeopardize Paris for me.

719
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:51,085
If that happens, I will search every Blimpie's in the tristate area until I track you down.

720
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:53,162
She's gonna fire me?

721
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:56,198
I don't know. She's not happy.

722
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,200
Andrea?

723
00:49:08,742 --> 00:49:10,710
Miranda, about last night, I-

724
00:49:10,811 --> 00:49:13,371
I need the new Harry Potter book for the twins.

725
00:49:13,481 --> 00:49:16,939
Okay. Okay. I'll go down to Barnes & Noble right now.

726
00:49:17,051 --> 00:49:21,784
Did you fall down and smack your little head on the pavement?

727
00:49:21,889 --> 00:49:24,483
Not that I can recall.

728
00:49:24,592 --> 00:49:28,460
We have all the published Harry Potter books. The twins want to know what happens next.

729
00:49:28,562 --> 00:49:31,998
You want the unpublished manuscript?

730
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:35,933
We know everyone in publishing. It shouldn't be a problem, should it?

731
00:49:36,036 --> 00:49:38,231
And you can do anything, right?

732
00:49:45,746 --> 00:49:48,840
Yes, Bobbsey. I know, baby.

733
00:49:48,949 --> 00:49:51,417
Mommy's working very hard to get it for you.

734
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:53,419
She doesn't get it.

735
00:49:53,521 --> 00:49:57,355
I could call frickin' J.K. Rowling herself. I'm not gonna get a copy of that book.

736
00:49:57,458 --> 00:49:59,653
My girls are leaving on the train for their grandmother's at 4:00...

737
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,228
so the book better be here no later than 3:00.

738
00:50:02,329 --> 00:50:06,993
- Of course! - And I would like my steak here in 15 minutes.

739
00:50:07,101 --> 00:50:09,661
No problem!

740
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:13,103
Okay. I have four hours to get the impossible manuscript.

741
00:50:13,207 --> 00:50:17,541
Smith & Wollensky's doesn't open until 11:30. How am I gonna get the steak?

742
00:50:17,645 --> 00:50:21,206
Okay. I will be back in 15 minutes.

743
00:50:21,315 --> 00:50:23,579
- Wish me luck! - No. Shan't.

744
00:50:23,684 --> 00:50:27,643
Yes, yes, yes, yes. I've been on hold. It's for Miranda Priestly.

745
00:50:27,755 --> 00:50:29,655
It's very important.

746
00:50:29,757 --> 00:50:32,021
Yes, I know it's impossible to get...

747
00:50:32,126 --> 00:50:35,687
but, well, I was wondering if you could make the impossible possible...

748
00:50:35,796 --> 00:50:37,764
if that's at all possible.

749
00:50:37,865 --> 00:50:41,323
Yes, I'm calling about the Harry Potter manuscript.

750
00:50:41,435 --> 00:50:44,268
Uh, no. Unpublished.

751
00:50:44,371 --> 00:50:46,669
Not a chance?

752
00:50:46,774 --> 00:50:48,765
Tell her that it's for Miranda Priestly.

753
00:50:48,876 --> 00:50:50,969
'Cause I think it makes a difference.

754
00:50:54,982 --> 00:50:57,746
Let me call you back.

755
00:50:57,851 --> 00:51:00,752
You probably don't remember me. We met at James Holt's party.

756
00:51:00,854 --> 00:51:02,822
I'm Miranda Priestly's assistant.

757
00:51:02,923 --> 00:51:06,051
The Harry Potter manuscript? Oh, you're kidding.

758
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,618
Uh, sorry to ask, but I'm desperate.

759
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:12,961
Just tell her it can't be done. You'll have to come up with a Plan "B."

760
00:51:13,067 --> 00:51:15,535
Well, this is Miranda Priestly we're talking about.

761
00:51:15,636 --> 00:51:17,797
There is no Plan "B." There's only Plan "A."

762
00:51:17,905 --> 00:51:21,204
Is she back? Am I fired?

763
00:51:21,308 --> 00:51:24,175
I rarely say this to people who aren't me...

764
00:51:24,278 --> 00:51:27,008
but you have got to calm down.

765
00:51:27,114 --> 00:51:29,082
Bloody hell!

766
00:51:34,622 --> 00:51:36,522
Coat, bag.

767
00:51:38,692 --> 00:51:42,685
What's that? Oh, I don't want that. I'm having lunch with Irv.

768
00:51:42,796 --> 00:51:45,822
I'll be back at 3:00. I'd like my Starbucks waiting.

769
00:51:45,933 --> 00:51:50,996
Oh, and if you don't have that Harry Potter book by then...

770
00:51:51,105 --> 00:51:53,767
don't even bother coming back.

771
00:52:06,553 --> 00:52:08,919
Hello.

772
00:52:09,023 --> 00:52:10,991
Quit? Are you sure?

773
00:52:11,091 --> 00:52:13,082
I failed. She's gonna fire me anyway.

774
00:52:13,193 --> 00:52:15,684
- I might as well beat her to the punch. - Wow.

775
00:52:15,796 --> 00:52:19,630
Andy, good for you. Congratulations. You're free.

776
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,726
- Yeah. Well, listen, I'll call you later. - Okay.

777
00:52:22,836 --> 00:52:25,361
Hello.

778
00:52:25,472 --> 00:52:27,440
I'm brilliant. No, really.

779
00:52:27,541 --> 00:52:31,773
- Monuments should be erected in my honor. - You didn't.

780
00:52:31,879 --> 00:52:34,313
Oh, yes. A friend of a friend does the cover art...

781
00:52:34,415 --> 00:52:36,315
and she happens to have the manuscript.

782
00:52:38,352 --> 00:52:42,584
Oh, no, 'cause that would mean that I actually did something right.

783
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:45,955
It's just- Oh!

784
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,960
The thing is, Christian, I was just-

785
00:52:48,062 --> 00:52:51,395
Look, you want this thing, you better hurry. I'll meet you at the St. Regis.

786
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,140
Excuse me.

787
00:53:12,986 --> 00:53:15,784
- Welcome to the St. Regis. May I assist you with anything? - Oh. Yes.

788
00:53:15,889 --> 00:53:18,915
- Uh, I'm meeting someone at the King Cole Bar. - Right this way.

789
00:53:21,528 --> 00:53:23,428
Hi.

790
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:26,192
- You have one hour. - Thank you.

791
00:53:36,076 --> 00:53:40,672
One copy. What are my twins gonna do with that? Share?

792
00:53:40,781 --> 00:53:42,681
Oh, no, I made two copies...

793
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:46,219
and had them covered, reset and bound so that they wouldn't look like manuscripts.

794
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,120
This is an extra copy to have on file. You know, just in case.

795
00:53:50,224 --> 00:53:53,193
Well, where are these fabulous copies? I don't see them anywhere.

796
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:59,224
They're with the twins, on the train on the way to Grandma's.

797
00:54:01,633 --> 00:54:03,533
Is there anything else I can do for you?

798
00:54:05,437 --> 00:54:08,964
Mm-mmm. That's all.

799
00:54:09,074 --> 00:54:10,701
Okay.

800
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:29,448
- Hey. - Hey. I went to Dean & Deluca.

801
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:32,621
Man, they charge, like, five dollars a strawberry there.

802
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:36,223
But I figure since you quit your job...

803
00:54:36,334 --> 00:54:38,359
we should celebrate.

804
00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:41,462
- Listen, Nate. - Wait a minute.

805
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:44,440
You quit your job, but you're still working on the twins' science project?

806
00:54:46,811 --> 00:54:48,938
Well, that's big of you.

807
00:54:49,047 --> 00:54:52,608
Okay, after we talked, I realized...

808
00:54:52,717 --> 00:54:57,780
it doesn't make sense throwing away all those months of hard work.

809
00:54:57,889 --> 00:55:00,153
I just had a moment of weakness, that's all.

810
00:55:00,258 --> 00:55:03,694
Yeah, well, either that, or your job sucks and your boss is a wacko.

811
00:55:06,931 --> 00:55:10,594
All right. Whatever. It's your job.

812
00:55:13,638 --> 00:55:15,902
Nate.

813
00:55:16,007 --> 00:55:18,134
Come on.

814
00:55:18,243 --> 00:55:20,302
I'm still the same person I was.

815
00:55:20,412 --> 00:55:23,848
I still want the same things. Okay?

816
00:55:23,948 --> 00:55:28,044
- Mm-hmm. - I promise. Same Andy, better clothes.

817
00:55:28,153 --> 00:55:31,281
I like the old clothes.

818
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:35,385
Really?

819
00:55:35,493 --> 00:55:38,462
Well, what about these necklaces? Do you like them?

820
00:55:39,931 --> 00:55:43,458
No? And this dress, it's new.

821
00:55:43,568 --> 00:55:45,593
Eh.

822
00:55:45,703 --> 00:55:49,366
Well, there is one other thing that's new...

823
00:55:49,474 --> 00:55:51,465
that I thought you might like.

824
00:55:51,576 --> 00:55:55,068
But, uh-What about this?

825
00:55:57,048 --> 00:55:58,913
You don't like it. I should better do-

826
00:55:59,017 --> 00:56:00,951
No, no, no, no.

827
00:56:19,971 --> 00:56:23,031
Is this number two look? This is number two?

828
00:56:23,141 --> 00:56:27,373
- Hi. - Hi. All right. Turn around for me, darling.

829
00:56:27,479 --> 00:56:29,709
Oh, I get it. I get it. I get it.

830
00:56:29,814 --> 00:56:31,839
The piece is called "urban jungle," right?

831
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:35,511
Yes, the modern woman unleashes the animal within to take on the big city.

832
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:38,487
Good. Go.

833
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:42,048
Sometimes I can't believe I talk about this crap all day.

834
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,651
- Bobby, come here. Let me see. - Oh, thank you.

835
00:56:44,762 --> 00:56:46,957
- Make sure Miranda gets these as soon as possible. - Mm-hmm.

836
00:56:47,065 --> 00:56:49,295
And tell her I switched in the Dior for the Rocha.

837
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,894
- Oh, great. Can't wait. - Excuse me.

838
00:56:54,005 --> 00:56:56,303
- Can we adjust the attitude? - I'm sorry.

839
00:56:56,407 --> 00:56:59,570
- Don't make me feed you to one of the models. - I'm sorry.

840
00:56:59,677 --> 00:57:01,577
It's a busy day.

841
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:03,977
My personal life is hanging by a thread, that's all.

842
00:57:04,082 --> 00:57:07,347
Join the club. That's what happens when you start doing well at work, darling.

843
00:57:07,452 --> 00:57:10,615
Let me know when your whole life goes up in smoke.

844
00:57:10,722 --> 00:57:12,690
That means it's time for a promotion.

845
00:57:20,398 --> 00:57:23,265
No. All right, February, back of the issue.

846
00:57:23,368 --> 00:57:25,928
Did anybody speak with Salma's people yet?

847
00:57:26,037 --> 00:57:28,767
Yes, but she'd rather do a summer cover because she has a movie coming out.

848
00:57:28,873 --> 00:57:33,071
No. Also, I'm pulling the Toobin piece on the Supreme Court women-

849
00:57:33,177 --> 00:57:34,838
woman.

850
00:57:34,946 --> 00:57:37,414
And I need to see a new draft on that piece...

851
00:57:37,515 --> 00:57:39,847
about shopping for a plastic surgeon- It's dull.

852
00:57:39,951 --> 00:57:44,479
And this layout for the Winter Wonderland spread.

853
00:57:44,589 --> 00:57:46,921
Not wonderful yet.

854
00:57:47,025 --> 00:57:48,856
Oh, okay. I-I'll look at it.

855
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,520
What about Testino? Where are we on that?

856
00:57:51,629 --> 00:57:53,654
Zac Posen's doing some very sculptural suits.

857
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:56,700
So I suggested that, uh, Testino shoot them at the Noguchi Garden.

858
00:57:56,801 --> 00:57:58,564
Perfect.

859
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:01,230
Thank God somebody came to work today.

860
00:58:01,339 --> 00:58:04,069
What about accessories for April?

861
00:58:04,175 --> 00:58:07,702
One thought I had was enamel. Um, bangles, pendants, earrings.

862
00:58:07,812 --> 00:58:09,905
No. We did that two years ago. What else?

863
00:58:10,014 --> 00:58:13,313
Um, well, they're showing a lot of florals right now, so I was thinking-

864
00:58:13,418 --> 00:58:17,821
Florals? For spring? Groundbreaking.

865
00:58:17,922 --> 00:58:20,390
But we thought about shooting them in an industrial space.

866
00:58:20,491 --> 00:58:23,289
We thought the contrast between the femininity of the florals...

867
00:58:23,394 --> 00:58:26,124
and the more raw, rough-hewn background would create this wonderful tension between-

868
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:27,431
No.

869
00:58:28,283 --> 00:58:29,411
Which?

870
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,360
No.

871
00:58:37,709 --> 00:58:40,507
Does anybody else have anything I can possibly use?

872
00:58:41,613 --> 00:58:44,446
Antibacterial wipes perhaps?

873
00:58:48,987 --> 00:58:53,151
- How's the cold doing? - Like death warmed up actually.

874
00:58:53,257 --> 00:58:55,350
Oh, God.

875
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:58,759
It's the benefit tonight. I've been looking forward to it for months.

876
00:58:58,863 --> 00:59:02,026
I refuse to be sick. I'm wearing Valentino, for crying out loud.

877
00:59:03,735 --> 00:59:06,898
Right. Well, everybody will be leaving soon to get ready...

878
00:59:07,005 --> 00:59:11,032
so I suggest you go and drop Miranda's Fendi bag off at the showroom...

879
00:59:11,142 --> 00:59:13,110
and then I suppose you can just go home.

880
00:59:13,211 --> 00:59:18,376
Yeah? Oh, well, that is great. Perfect actually.

881
00:59:18,483 --> 00:59:21,816
I need to get to Magnolia Bakery before it closes. It's Nate's birthday tonight.

882
00:59:21,919 --> 00:59:24,547
So we're, uh, having a little party for him.

883
00:59:24,656 --> 00:59:27,716
Yeah, I'm hearing this, and I wanna hear this.

884
00:59:29,494 --> 00:59:31,394
Bye.

885
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:35,997
I love my job. I love my job. I love my job.

886
00:59:44,542 --> 00:59:46,567
Hello?

887
00:59:50,214 --> 00:59:52,739
Before the benefit tonight, I need to make sure...

888
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:55,512
that you're both fully prepped on the guest list.

889
00:59:55,620 --> 01:00:01,183
But I thought that only the first assistant went to the benefit.

890
01:00:01,292 --> 01:00:03,760
Only when the first assistant hasn't decided to become...

891
01:00:03,861 --> 01:00:06,352
an incubus of viral plague.

892
01:00:07,665 --> 01:00:10,828
You'll come and help Emily.

893
01:00:10,935 --> 01:00:14,200
- That's all. - Right.

894
01:00:14,305 --> 01:00:17,638
These are all of the guests. Miranda invites everyone.

895
01:00:17,742 --> 01:00:21,405
We have to make sure that they all think she knows exactly who they are.

896
01:00:21,512 --> 01:00:23,673
And I've been studying for weeks.

897
01:00:23,781 --> 01:00:25,544
I have to learn all these by tonight?

898
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:28,847
No, don't be silly, Andrea. These too.

899
01:00:28,953 --> 01:00:32,753
Look, you better just start without me, okay? I'll get there as soon as I can.

900
01:00:32,857 --> 01:00:34,984
Andy, come on, it's his birth-

901
01:00:35,093 --> 01:00:37,118
Okay, but hurry.

902
01:00:37,228 --> 01:00:39,958
Oh, please, believe me, I will. This is the last thing that I wanna-

903
01:00:40,064 --> 01:00:43,898
Ooh, I love that. Uh, I'll call you the second I'm leaving, okay?

904
01:00:44,001 --> 01:00:46,469
- Will that fit me? - Oh, yeah.

905
01:00:46,571 --> 01:00:49,301
A little Crisco and some fishing line, and we're in business.

906
01:01:16,768 --> 01:01:18,759
Well, nothing really. I mean, this is-

907
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:23,068
I mean, really, this is the social event of the season.

908
01:01:37,789 --> 01:01:41,657
Oh, oh, my God. Andy, you look so chic.

909
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:45,422
Oh, thanks, Em. You look so thin.

910
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:47,430
- Do I? - Yeah.

911
01:01:47,532 --> 01:01:49,932
Oh, it's for Paris. I'm on this new diet.

912
01:01:50,034 --> 01:01:51,934
It's very effective. Well, I don't eat anything.

913
01:01:52,036 --> 01:01:55,403
And then when I feel like I'm about to faint, I eat a cube of cheese.

914
01:01:55,506 --> 01:01:57,406
- Well, it's definitely working. - I know.

915
01:01:57,508 --> 01:02:00,033
I'm just one stomach flu away from my goal weight.

916
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:21,029
That's John Folger, the new artistic director of the Chelsea Rep.

917
01:02:21,132 --> 01:02:23,566
- John, thanks for coming. - Hey there.

918
01:02:23,668 --> 01:02:26,398
- Oh, thank you. It's always nice seeing you. - Stop fidgeting.

919
01:02:26,504 --> 01:02:29,132
I'm sorry. I'm so late.

920
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,231
Just deal with it. You have to be here.

921
01:02:36,681 --> 01:02:38,808
Emily, come here.

922
01:02:38,916 --> 01:02:41,749
Isn't that Jacqueline Follet from French Runway?

923
01:02:41,853 --> 01:02:44,014
Oh, my God, and Miranda hates her.

924
01:02:44,121 --> 01:02:46,089
She was supposed to arrive after Miranda left.

925
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:47,680
- I didn't- Oh. - Yeah.

926
01:02:47,792 --> 01:02:52,422
- Miranda, fabulous event as always. - You brought Jacqueline.

927
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:55,158
- Surprise. - Quelle surprise.

928
01:02:57,435 --> 01:03:01,838
Oh, wonderful. We're so happy you were able to come to our little gathering.

929
01:03:01,939 --> 01:03:05,670
Of course. I plan my whole year around this.

930
01:03:05,776 --> 01:03:10,577
Well, we're so grateful that you do.

931
01:03:12,016 --> 01:03:15,110
- Ciao. - Have you gotten my note?

932
01:03:15,219 --> 01:03:17,483
Yes, I did. We'll discuss it on Wednesday.

933
01:03:17,588 --> 01:03:21,115
- Yes, I agree. No business tonight. - Not tonight.

934
01:03:21,225 --> 01:03:23,193
Enjoy.

935
01:03:23,294 --> 01:03:25,455
Em.

936
01:03:25,563 --> 01:03:27,531
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

937
01:03:31,836 --> 01:03:36,068
Oh, um- Oh, my God. I just can't remember what his name is.

938
01:03:36,173 --> 01:03:38,641
I just saw his name this morning on the list.

939
01:03:38,743 --> 01:03:41,610
It's- Oh, I know this. It's something to do with-

940
01:03:41,712 --> 01:03:46,809
Wait, he was- he was part of the- Oh, God, I know this. Um-

941
01:03:46,918 --> 01:03:51,548
It's Ambassador Franklin, and that's the woman that he left his wife for, Rebecca.

942
01:03:54,425 --> 01:03:56,893
- Rebecca. Ambassador. - Miranda.

943
01:03:56,994 --> 01:03:59,724
- You look fabulous. - Oh, very kind.

944
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:03,061
Thank you.

945
01:04:11,008 --> 01:04:12,908
- Look at you. - Hello.

946
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:15,103
You're-You're a vision.

947
01:04:15,212 --> 01:04:17,908
- Oh. - Thank God I saved your job.

948
01:04:18,015 --> 01:04:22,850
You know, I figured out a few things on my own too.

949
01:04:22,954 --> 01:04:25,320
Turns out, I'm not as nice as you thought.

950
01:04:25,423 --> 01:04:27,914
I hope not.

951
01:04:28,025 --> 01:04:30,118
Well, if it weren't for the stupid boyfriend...

952
01:04:30,227 --> 01:04:33,196
I'd have to whisk you away right here and now.

953
01:04:34,765 --> 01:04:38,496
- Do you actually say things like that to people? - Evidently.

954
01:04:38,602 --> 01:04:41,298
Well, I gotta go.

955
01:04:41,405 --> 01:04:44,306
Are you sure? 'Cause my editor for New York Magazine is inside...

956
01:04:44,408 --> 01:04:46,433
and, you know, I could introduce you two.

957
01:04:46,544 --> 01:04:51,140
- You sent over your stuff for me to look at? Remember? - Yeah.

958
01:04:51,248 --> 01:04:55,981
All right, I gotta admit, I only read a couple. It was a very large packet you sent.

959
01:04:56,087 --> 01:04:57,987
- Yeah. - But what I did read wasn't half bad.

960
01:04:58,089 --> 01:05:00,523
And, you know, I think- I think you have a talent, Andy.

961
01:05:00,624 --> 01:05:03,457
He should meet you.

962
01:05:03,561 --> 01:05:05,620
Why don't you come in? Just for one drink.

963
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:09,826
Um, okay, yeah. I guess I could for one-

964
01:05:09,934 --> 01:05:13,131
No, I can't. I'm sorry, but I have to go.

965
01:05:13,237 --> 01:05:16,798
All right. Give my best to the boyfriend.

966
01:05:24,081 --> 01:05:26,242
Roy, I'm sorry. Can you go any faster?

967
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:29,148
I'm sure Nate will understand.

968
01:05:31,322 --> 01:05:33,222
Yeah.

969
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:38,057
Hey.

970
01:05:53,177 --> 01:05:55,441
Happy birthday.

971
01:05:59,517 --> 01:06:02,384
Nate, I'm so sorry.

972
01:06:02,486 --> 01:06:06,547
I kept trying to leave, but there was a lot going on.

973
01:06:06,657 --> 01:06:08,750
And, you know, I didn't have a choice.

974
01:06:08,859 --> 01:06:10,759
Don't worry about it.

975
01:06:10,861 --> 01:06:13,887
I'm gonna go to bed.

976
01:06:15,866 --> 01:06:18,266
Can we at least talk about this?

977
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:28,537
You look really pretty.

978
01:07:10,187 --> 01:07:12,087
Andrea?

979
01:07:24,235 --> 01:07:27,432
- Do you have the Book? - Oh. Uh-

980
01:07:30,141 --> 01:07:32,769
Mm.

981
01:07:32,877 --> 01:07:36,176
Paris is the most important week of my entire year.

982
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,511
I need the best possible team with me.

983
01:07:40,985 --> 01:07:43,044
That no longer includes Emily.

984
01:07:45,556 --> 01:07:48,491
Wait. You want me to-

985
01:07:48,592 --> 01:07:51,857
No, Miranda.

986
01:07:51,962 --> 01:07:54,157
Emily would die.

987
01:07:54,265 --> 01:07:57,723
Her whole life is about Paris.

988
01:07:57,835 --> 01:08:02,204
She hasn't eaten in weeks. I-I can't... do that.

989
01:08:02,306 --> 01:08:05,070
Miranda, I can't.

990
01:08:05,176 --> 01:08:08,270
If you don't go, I'll assume you're not serious about your future...

991
01:08:08,379 --> 01:08:12,110
at Runway or any other publication.

992
01:08:17,955 --> 01:08:19,980
The decision's yours.

993
01:08:21,992 --> 01:08:24,222
That's all.

994
01:09:23,254 --> 01:09:27,020
Hey, Andy.

995
01:09:27,124 --> 01:09:29,354
- Hey. - You coming to bed anytime soon?

996
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:31,621
Uh, yeah. Five minutes, okay?

997
01:10:27,785 --> 01:10:29,810
Andrea, don't forget to tell Emily.

998
01:10:32,156 --> 01:10:34,454
Do it now.

999
01:10:43,434 --> 01:10:46,528
Don't pick up.

1000
01:10:46,637 --> 01:10:49,197
- Don't pick up. Don't pick up. Don't pick- - Hi.

1001
01:10:49,306 --> 01:10:51,206
- Emily. - Hi, hi. Sorry I'm late.

1002
01:10:51,308 --> 01:10:53,902
It's just Miranda wanted some scarves from Hermès.

1003
01:10:54,011 --> 01:10:56,571
And she did tell me yesterday, but I forgot like an idiot.

1004
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,580
And so I freaked out, of course.

1005
01:10:58,682 --> 01:11:01,412
Emily, Emily, I-I need to talk to you.

1006
01:11:01,518 --> 01:11:04,487
I called Martine at home, and she opened the shop early. Whoa! I'm sorry.

1007
01:11:04,588 --> 01:11:07,489
She opened the shop early for me, so I got them, which is great.

1008
01:11:07,591 --> 01:11:11,027
Okay. Um, Emily, wh-when you come in...

1009
01:11:11,128 --> 01:11:13,426
there's something I have to talk to you about.

1010
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:16,226
- Well, I hope it's not another Miranda problem. - Not exactly.

1011
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:19,860
Well, good, because I've got so much to deal with before I go. I swear to God-

1012
01:11:22,606 --> 01:11:26,770
Oh, my God!

1013
01:11:26,877 --> 01:11:28,708
Emily?

1014
01:11:37,955 --> 01:11:41,584
I don't care if she was gonna fire you or beat you with a red-hot poker!

1015
01:11:41,692 --> 01:11:43,592
You should have said no.

1016
01:11:43,694 --> 01:11:45,685
Emily, I didn't have a choice.

1017
01:11:45,796 --> 01:11:47,889
- Oh. Please. - You know how she is.

1018
01:11:47,998 --> 01:11:50,592
That is a pathetic excuse.

1019
01:11:54,471 --> 01:11:56,371
Thanks.

1020
01:11:56,473 --> 01:11:58,941
Do you know what really just...

1021
01:11:59,042 --> 01:12:01,704
gets me about this whole thing...

1022
01:12:01,812 --> 01:12:06,112
is that, you know, you're the one who said you don't really care about this stuff.

1023
01:12:06,216 --> 01:12:10,118
And you don't really care about fashion. You just wanna be a journalist.

1024
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:12,120
What a pile of bollocks!

1025
01:12:12,222 --> 01:12:14,281
Emily, I know you're mad. I don't blame you.

1026
01:12:14,391 --> 01:12:18,487
Face it, you sold your soul the day you put on that first pair of Jimmy Choo's.

1027
01:12:18,595 --> 01:12:23,430
I saw it. And you know what really just kills me about this whole thing...

1028
01:12:23,534 --> 01:12:25,559
is the clothes that you're gonna get.

1029
01:12:25,669 --> 01:12:28,467
I mean, you don't deserve them.

1030
01:12:28,572 --> 01:12:31,268
You eat carbs, for Christ's sake.

1031
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:35,675
God, it's so unfair!

1032
01:12:35,779 --> 01:12:38,111
- Emily. - Just go.

1033
01:12:44,521 --> 01:12:46,580
- Emily, I- - I said go!

1034
01:12:52,529 --> 01:12:55,123
- You are going to Paris for the couture shows? - Mm-hmm.

1035
01:12:55,232 --> 01:12:57,928
- That's the coolest fashion event of the year. - Mm-hmm.

1036
01:12:58,035 --> 01:13:00,230
- I mean, who are you going to see, Galliano? - Yeah.

1037
01:13:00,337 --> 01:13:03,135
- And Lagerfeld and Nicholas Ghesquiere. - Yep.

1038
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:06,004
Yes. Okay, now you're scaring me.

1039
01:13:06,109 --> 01:13:09,203
- Hey. - Hey.

1040
01:13:09,313 --> 01:13:13,374
- This show is amazing. I am so proud of you. - Thank you.

1041
01:13:13,484 --> 01:13:16,180
Okay, start with the photos in the back and work your way forward.

1042
01:13:16,286 --> 01:13:18,345
That is the way I designed it. It is brilliant.

1043
01:13:18,455 --> 01:13:19,820
- You will love it. - Of course.

1044
01:13:19,923 --> 01:13:22,414
And you, I have somebody I want you to meet, okay?

1045
01:13:22,526 --> 01:13:24,460
Ooh, art and sex. Lead the way.

1046
01:13:24,561 --> 01:13:26,552
- See you later. - Okay.

1047
01:13:44,948 --> 01:13:49,248
Hey. Hey, Miranda girl.

1048
01:13:51,188 --> 01:13:54,715
- Hi. - I was just thinking about you.

1049
01:13:54,825 --> 01:13:56,759
Oh, come on.

1050
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:58,760
- It's true. - No.

1051
01:13:58,862 --> 01:14:03,458
I'm profiling Gaultier for Interview and, uh, making my Paris plans.

1052
01:14:03,567 --> 01:14:07,970
I found myself wondering if, uh, you were gonna be there.

1053
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:13,236
Well, actually, um, I am going.

1054
01:14:13,343 --> 01:14:17,939
Great. I'm staying in a fantastic little hotel in the Seventh...

1055
01:14:18,048 --> 01:14:22,041
right across the street from the falafel restaurant that will change your life.

1056
01:14:22,152 --> 01:14:27,146
I'm sorry. I'll be too busy working.

1057
01:14:27,257 --> 01:14:29,885
You'll have to find someone else's life to change.

1058
01:14:31,395 --> 01:14:33,590
Well, that's just it.

1059
01:14:33,697 --> 01:14:35,892
I'm beginning to wonder if I can.

1060
01:14:49,012 --> 01:14:50,536
Lily.

1061
01:14:51,949 --> 01:14:54,110
Lily, he's just a guy I know from work.

1062
01:14:54,217 --> 01:14:57,084
- Yeah, that looked like work. - Look, you're making a big deal out of-

1063
01:14:57,187 --> 01:15:00,588
You know, the Andy I know is madly in love with Nate...

1064
01:15:00,691 --> 01:15:02,886
is always five minutes early...

1065
01:15:02,993 --> 01:15:05,723
and thinks, I don't know, Club Monaco is couture.

1066
01:15:05,829 --> 01:15:09,424
For the last 16 years, I've known everything about that Andy.

1067
01:15:09,533 --> 01:15:13,492
But this person? This "glamazon" who skulks around in corners...

1068
01:15:13,604 --> 01:15:16,630
with some random hot fashion guy?

1069
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:18,765
I don't get her.

1070
01:15:18,875 --> 01:15:22,333
- Lily. - Have fun in Paris.

1071
01:15:23,447 --> 01:15:25,881
You going to Paris?

1072
01:15:25,983 --> 01:15:28,611
Uh, yeah. It just happened.

1073
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:32,177
I thought Paris was a big deal for Emily or-

1074
01:15:32,289 --> 01:15:35,122
Great. Now you're gonna give me a hard time too?

1075
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:40,491
Hey, Andy. Andy!

1076
01:15:40,597 --> 01:15:43,862
- Andy, what the hell is wrong with you? - I-I didn't have a choice, okay?

1077
01:15:43,967 --> 01:15:46,128
- Miranda asked me, and I couldn't say no. - I know.

1078
01:15:46,236 --> 01:15:48,261
That's your answer for everything lately, "I didn't have a choice."

1079
01:15:48,372 --> 01:15:50,272
- Like this job was forced on you. - Nate, I get it, okay?

1080
01:15:50,374 --> 01:15:52,308
Like you don't make these decisions yourself.

1081
01:15:52,409 --> 01:15:54,775
You're mad because I work late all the time and I missed your birthday party.

1082
01:15:54,878 --> 01:15:57,278
- And I'm sorry. - Oh, come on. What am I, four?

1083
01:15:57,381 --> 01:16:00,214
You-You hate Runway and Miranda.

1084
01:16:00,317 --> 01:16:03,184
And you think fashion is stupid. You've made that clear.

1085
01:16:03,286 --> 01:16:06,653
Andy, I make port wine reductions all day.

1086
01:16:06,757 --> 01:16:08,850
I'm not exactly in the Peace Corps.

1087
01:16:08,959 --> 01:16:11,894
You know, I wouldn't care if you were out there pole dancing all night...

1088
01:16:11,995 --> 01:16:14,520
as long as you did it with a little integrity.

1089
01:16:14,631 --> 01:16:16,360
You used to say this was just a job.

1090
01:16:16,466 --> 01:16:18,798
You used to make fun of the Runway girls.

1091
01:16:18,902 --> 01:16:20,893
What happened? Now you've become one of them.

1092
01:16:22,406 --> 01:16:26,206
- That's absurd. - That's okay. That's fine. Just own up to it.

1093
01:16:26,309 --> 01:16:30,439
And then we can stop pretending like we have anything in common anymore.

1094
01:16:30,547 --> 01:16:33,846
- You don't mean that, do you? - No, I do.

1095
01:16:41,024 --> 01:16:43,015
Well...

1096
01:16:43,126 --> 01:16:45,094
maybe this trip is coming at a good time.

1097
01:16:45,195 --> 01:16:47,493
Maybe we should take a break.

1098
01:16:54,671 --> 01:16:57,265
Nate?

1099
01:17:06,183 --> 01:17:09,778
I'm sorry. Just... one second?

1100
01:17:11,955 --> 01:17:14,150
You know, in case you were wondering...

1101
01:17:14,257 --> 01:17:18,193
the person whose calls you always take, that's the relationship you're in.

1102
01:17:18,295 --> 01:17:20,263
I hope you two are very happy together.

1103
01:17:29,439 --> 01:17:31,566
Hello, Miranda.

1104
01:18:45,148 --> 01:18:47,048
Pardon. Miranda.

1105
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:50,051
Maestro. Mmm.

1106
01:18:50,153 --> 01:18:53,145
How are you? So glad to see you. Thank you for coming.

1107
01:18:53,256 --> 01:18:57,124
- You like the collection? - Absolutely. I think it's the best in years.

1108
01:18:57,227 --> 01:18:59,718
- This is very important for me. Very, very important. - I'm very happy for you.

1109
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:02,060
- This is my new Emily. - Hello. How do you do?

1110
01:19:02,165 --> 01:19:04,690
- I'm good. Pleasure. - Nice to meet you.

1111
01:19:04,801 --> 01:19:06,701
You love the show?

1112
01:19:11,274 --> 01:19:14,141
Miranda. This way!

1113
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:22,812
Miranda. Nigel. Fashion's great gatekeepers.

1114
01:19:22,919 --> 01:19:27,982
Miranda, what is Runway's position on French fashion versus American fashion?

1115
01:19:28,091 --> 01:19:30,559
- I've been thinking- - Oh.

1116
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:34,357
- You still owe me for Harry Potter. - Oh, do I?

1117
01:19:34,464 --> 01:19:36,432
- Of course you do. Are you working tonight? - Oh!

1118
01:19:36,533 --> 01:19:40,993
- No, actually Miranda has a dinner. - Great, you're free.

1119
01:19:41,104 --> 01:19:44,267
Oh, but there is the problem of le boyfriend.

1120
01:19:44,374 --> 01:19:48,174
Wait, don't tell me. The boyfriend non plus?

1121
01:19:48,278 --> 01:19:50,940
Je suis très, très desolé.

1122
01:19:51,047 --> 01:19:53,015
Oh, you're so full of it. You're not desolé at all.

1123
01:19:53,116 --> 01:19:55,676
No, not even a little. What time should I pick you up?

1124
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:58,954
- Uh- - I'll call you.

1125
01:19:59,055 --> 01:20:01,785
Yeah.

1126
01:20:19,009 --> 01:20:20,909
Oh.

1127
01:20:23,146 --> 01:20:26,604
Oh, there you are.

1128
01:20:26,716 --> 01:20:32,086
We need to go over the seating, uh, chart for the luncheon.

1129
01:20:32,188 --> 01:20:35,783
Okay. Um, yeah, sure.

1130
01:20:35,892 --> 01:20:38,918
I have it right here.

1131
01:20:42,532 --> 01:20:46,559
By all means, move at a glacial pace. You know how that thrills me.

1132
01:20:53,410 --> 01:20:55,810
Okay.

1133
01:20:55,912 --> 01:20:59,143
So...

1134
01:20:59,249 --> 01:21:04,448
first of all, we need to move Snoop Dogg to my table.

1135
01:21:04,554 --> 01:21:06,454
But your table's full.

1136
01:21:08,024 --> 01:21:09,924
Stephen isn't coming.

1137
01:21:10,026 --> 01:21:12,927
Oh, Stephen is-

1138
01:21:13,029 --> 01:21:17,022
So I don't need to fetch Stephen from the airport tomorrow?

1139
01:21:17,133 --> 01:21:21,365
Well, if you speak to him and he decides to rethink the divorce...

1140
01:21:21,471 --> 01:21:24,497
then, yes, fetch away.

1141
01:21:24,607 --> 01:21:28,043
You're very fetching, so go fetch.

1142
01:21:33,383 --> 01:21:37,581
And then when we get back to New York, we need to contact, um...

1143
01:21:39,322 --> 01:21:43,156
Leslie to see what she can do to minimize the press...

1144
01:21:44,594 --> 01:21:46,494
on all this.

1145
01:21:49,699 --> 01:21:52,133
Another divorce...

1146
01:21:52,235 --> 01:21:55,295
splashed across page six.

1147
01:21:55,405 --> 01:21:58,431
I can just imagine what they're gonna write about me.

1148
01:21:58,541 --> 01:22:02,807
The Dragon Lady, career-obsessed.

1149
01:22:02,912 --> 01:22:06,313
Snow Queen drives away another Mr. Priestly.

1150
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:10,075
Rupert Murdoch should cut me a check...

1151
01:22:10,186 --> 01:22:12,677
for all the papers I sell for him.

1152
01:22:14,691 --> 01:22:16,818
Anyway, I don't-

1153
01:22:16,926 --> 01:22:19,986
I don't really care what anybody writes about me.

1154
01:22:22,432 --> 01:22:25,401
But my- my girls, I just-

1155
01:22:25,502 --> 01:22:28,869
It's just so unfair to the girls.

1156
01:22:28,972 --> 01:22:30,872
It's just...

1157
01:22:33,243 --> 01:22:35,234
another disappointment...

1158
01:22:35,345 --> 01:22:38,940
another letdown, another father... figure-

1159
01:22:39,049 --> 01:22:41,950
gone.

1160
01:22:43,153 --> 01:22:47,214
Anyway, the point is-

1161
01:22:47,323 --> 01:22:50,918
The point is-

1162
01:22:51,027 --> 01:22:55,259
The point is we really need to figure out where to place Donatella...

1163
01:22:55,365 --> 01:22:58,391
because she's barely speaking to anyone.

1164
01:23:07,977 --> 01:23:10,969
I'm so sorry, Miranda.

1165
01:23:11,081 --> 01:23:13,641
If you want me to cancel your evening, I can.

1166
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:16,981
Don't be ridiculous. Why would we do that?

1167
01:23:18,088 --> 01:23:20,386
Um, is-

1168
01:23:20,490 --> 01:23:22,458
Is there anything else I can do?

1169
01:23:23,993 --> 01:23:25,984
Your job.

1170
01:23:29,165 --> 01:23:31,099
That's all.

1171
01:23:57,193 --> 01:23:59,252
Hi. I need Miranda's itinerary for tomorrow.

1172
01:23:59,362 --> 01:24:01,262
- Okay. Come on in. - All right? Thanks.

1173
01:24:05,935 --> 01:24:08,768
- Who put that together for you? - This?

1174
01:24:08,872 --> 01:24:11,864
Oh, it's just- it's just something I threw on.

1175
01:24:11,975 --> 01:24:15,103
Turn around. Let me see. Turn.

1176
01:24:15,211 --> 01:24:19,045
- Mm. Incroyable. - Yeah?

1177
01:24:19,149 --> 01:24:22,141
- It's really just- No, it's- No, gorgeous. - Yeah? Okay, good.

1178
01:24:22,252 --> 01:24:25,483
Really. I think that my work here is done.

1179
01:24:25,588 --> 01:24:27,647
Oh.

1180
01:24:27,757 --> 01:24:30,225
We're going to celebrate. I'm going to get some champagne.

1181
01:24:30,326 --> 01:24:32,521
Okay. What are we toasting?

1182
01:24:32,629 --> 01:24:37,328
We are toasting, my dear, to the dream job.

1183
01:24:37,433 --> 01:24:41,392
The one that a million girls wanted.

1184
01:24:41,504 --> 01:24:44,029
Which I got months ago.

1185
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:46,574
I'm not talking about you.

1186
01:24:46,676 --> 01:24:49,372
Mm-hmm.

1187
01:24:49,479 --> 01:24:51,743
- James Holt- - Yeah.

1188
01:24:51,848 --> 01:24:53,748
Massimo Corteleoni...

1189
01:24:55,351 --> 01:24:57,819
is investing in James's company and taking it global.

1190
01:24:57,921 --> 01:25:02,085
- Mm-hmm. - Bags, shoes, fragrances- the works.

1191
01:25:03,226 --> 01:25:06,491
And James needs a partner.

1192
01:25:06,596 --> 01:25:12,432
And that partner would be me.

1193
01:25:14,571 --> 01:25:16,903
- Does Miranda- - No, no, Miranda knows, because-

1194
01:25:17,006 --> 01:25:19,600
- Oh. - Oh, she put me up for it. God, no. Can you imagine?

1195
01:25:19,709 --> 01:25:22,109
But- But- But you're leaving.

1196
01:25:22,212 --> 01:25:25,010
- Mm-hmm. - I can't imagine Runway without you.

1197
01:25:25,114 --> 01:25:28,140
I know, I know, but I'm so excited though.

1198
01:25:28,251 --> 01:25:32,517
This is the first time in 18 years I'm going to be able to call the shots in my own life.

1199
01:25:32,622 --> 01:25:35,056
Oh, my God!

1200
01:25:35,158 --> 01:25:40,221
I'm going to be able to come to Paris and actually see Paris.

1201
01:25:42,298 --> 01:25:44,766
Well, congratulations.

1202
01:25:44,867 --> 01:25:48,064
- Huh? Oh. - Nigel, you deserve it.

1203
01:25:50,406 --> 01:25:53,705
You bet your size-six ass.

1204
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:56,973
- Four. - Really?

1205
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:58,980
Cheers.

1206
01:25:59,082 --> 01:26:02,711
- Cheers to you. - To us.

1207
01:26:02,819 --> 01:26:05,049
Let me see that.

1208
01:26:08,658 --> 01:26:13,459
Okay, I just wanna say that yes, there are things Miranda does that I don't agree with, but-

1209
01:26:13,563 --> 01:26:16,191
- Come on. You hate her. Just admit it to me. - No.

1210
01:26:16,299 --> 01:26:18,767
She's a- She's a notorious sadist...

1211
01:26:18,868 --> 01:26:20,995
and not- not in a good way.

1212
01:26:21,104 --> 01:26:24,369
Okay, she's tough, but if Miranda were a man...

1213
01:26:24,474 --> 01:26:28,069
no one would notice anything about her, except how great she is at her job.

1214
01:26:28,177 --> 01:26:31,112
I'm sorry. I can't-

1215
01:26:31,214 --> 01:26:34,274
- I can't believe this. You're defending her? - Yeah.

1216
01:26:34,384 --> 01:26:37,615
The wide-eyed girl peddling her earnest newspaper stories?

1217
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:40,848
You, my friend, are crossing over to the dark side.

1218
01:26:42,458 --> 01:26:44,358
I resent that.

1219
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:47,657
- You shouldn't. It's sexy. - Sexy?

1220
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:53,669
- Really? - Really.

1221
01:26:58,141 --> 01:27:00,609
So do you- do you know where we're going?

1222
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:02,302
- 'Cause I'm lost. - Yeah.

1223
01:27:02,412 --> 01:27:05,040
Yeah, don't worry. I know this city like the back of my hand.

1224
01:27:05,148 --> 01:27:08,208
It's my favorite place in the whole world.

1225
01:27:08,318 --> 01:27:10,218
You know, Gertrude Stein once said...

1226
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:14,848
"America is my country, and Paris is my hometown."

1227
01:27:14,957 --> 01:27:17,084
It's true.

1228
01:27:17,193 --> 01:27:19,161
What do you do?

1229
01:27:19,262 --> 01:27:21,253
Do you just write stuff like that down...

1230
01:27:21,364 --> 01:27:24,856
and then file it away to use on us girls?

1231
01:27:24,967 --> 01:27:28,425
- I'm Christian Thompson. That's my way. - That's your way. Right.

1232
01:27:28,538 --> 01:27:31,166
I work freelance. I have a lot of free time on my hands.

1233
01:27:33,142 --> 01:27:35,804
You know, I never understood...

1234
01:27:35,912 --> 01:27:38,972
why everyone was so crazy about Paris...

1235
01:27:39,082 --> 01:27:43,883
but... it is so beautiful.

1236
01:27:46,322 --> 01:27:50,691
Mm. I-I can't. I'm sorry.

1237
01:27:50,793 --> 01:27:55,628
I can't. You know, Nate and I just split up a couple days ago, and I can't.

1238
01:27:58,835 --> 01:28:01,269
Ooh. I've had too much wine.

1239
01:28:01,371 --> 01:28:04,898
And my hearing-vision- judgment's impaired.

1240
01:28:08,745 --> 01:28:11,680
No, I barely know you. I'm in a strange city.

1241
01:28:13,616 --> 01:28:17,712
I... am out of excuses.

1242
01:28:17,820 --> 01:28:19,549
Thank God.

1243
01:29:07,937 --> 01:29:09,837
Yes.

1244
01:29:13,376 --> 01:29:15,469
Oh, shoot.

1245
01:29:23,619 --> 01:29:25,814
Bonjour, madame.

1246
01:29:25,922 --> 01:29:28,356
Uh, what the hell is this?

1247
01:29:28,458 --> 01:29:31,689
What does it look like? It's a mock-up.

1248
01:29:31,794 --> 01:29:33,921
Yeah. Of?

1249
01:29:34,030 --> 01:29:39,161
Of what American Runway will look like when Jacqueline Follet is the new editor in chief.

1250
01:29:39,268 --> 01:29:42,362
Wh-They're replacing Miranda?

1251
01:29:42,472 --> 01:29:46,272
Yeah. And she's bringing me in to run all the editorial content.

1252
01:29:48,578 --> 01:29:50,808
You're really surprised?

1253
01:29:50,913 --> 01:29:54,679
Jacqueline's a lot younger than Miranda. She has a fresher take on things.

1254
01:29:54,784 --> 01:30:00,222
Not to mention American Runway's one of the most expensive books in the business.

1255
01:30:00,323 --> 01:30:04,453
Jacqueline does the same thing for a lot less money.

1256
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,052
And Irv- Irv's a businessman, you know.

1257
01:30:08,164 --> 01:30:12,464
Miranda will be devastated. Her whole life is about Runway. He can't do that to her.

1258
01:30:12,568 --> 01:30:16,026
It's done. Irv's gonna tell Miranda after the party for James.

1259
01:30:16,138 --> 01:30:18,163
And she has no idea?

1260
01:30:18,274 --> 01:30:20,742
She's a big girl. She'll be fine.

1261
01:30:21,978 --> 01:30:25,072
Shi- I have to go.

1262
01:30:25,181 --> 01:30:27,172
Andy.

1263
01:30:27,283 --> 01:30:29,478
Andy, it's done.

1264
01:30:29,585 --> 01:30:31,712
Baby, it's done.

1265
01:30:33,122 --> 01:30:35,556
I'm not your baby.

1266
01:30:43,766 --> 01:30:46,166
Allo.

1267
01:30:46,269 --> 01:30:48,703
Oh! Oh! Thank God you're there.

1268
01:30:48,804 --> 01:30:51,466
- Excuse me? - I need to talk to you right away.

1269
01:30:51,574 --> 01:30:53,872
It's about Jacqueline Follet.

1270
01:30:53,976 --> 01:30:58,538
Shit! Oh, shit! Shit, shit, shit!

1271
01:31:14,764 --> 01:31:18,757
- Yes. - Mr. Ravitz, I'm so sorry to bother you. I was wondering-

1272
01:31:18,868 --> 01:31:21,462
Have you completely lost your mind?

1273
01:31:21,571 --> 01:31:25,735
- I need to talk to you. - Do not disturb me again.

1274
01:31:25,841 --> 01:31:28,867
But, um, it's just for one- Miranda!

1275
01:31:47,063 --> 01:31:50,794
Miranda. Miranda. Wait, I need to talk to you.

1276
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:53,460
Irv is making Jacqueline Follet the editor in chief of Runway.

1277
01:31:53,569 --> 01:31:55,560
Christian Thompson told me he's gonna work for her.

1278
01:31:55,671 --> 01:31:59,107
Irv is going to tell you today. I thought maybe if I told you, that you could fix it.

1279
01:31:59,208 --> 01:32:01,108
Do I smell freesias?

1280
01:32:01,210 --> 01:32:05,408
What? No. I-I specifically told them-

1281
01:32:05,514 --> 01:32:09,951
If I see freesias anywhere...

1282
01:32:10,052 --> 01:32:13,283
I will be very disappointed.

1283
01:32:13,389 --> 01:32:17,826
For 72 years, Runway has been more than a magazine.

1284
01:32:17,927 --> 01:32:21,590
It has been a beacon of elegance and grace.

1285
01:32:21,697 --> 01:32:27,033
Miranda Priestly is the finest possible guardian of that beacon...

1286
01:32:27,136 --> 01:32:32,472
setting a standard that inspires people across the globe.

1287
01:32:32,575 --> 01:32:36,511
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Miranda Priestly.

1288
01:32:54,163 --> 01:32:57,860
Thank you, my dear friend.

1289
01:32:57,967 --> 01:33:00,868
Bonjour.

1290
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:04,030
Thank you very much for coming today...

1291
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:08,577
to help celebrate our dear friend, James Holt.

1292
01:33:16,552 --> 01:33:20,215
But before I talk to you about James...

1293
01:33:20,322 --> 01:33:23,814
and his many accomplishments...

1294
01:33:23,926 --> 01:33:27,726
I would like first to share some news with you.

1295
01:33:29,632 --> 01:33:32,726
Um, as many of you know...

1296
01:33:32,835 --> 01:33:35,565
uh, recently Massimo Corteleoni...

1297
01:33:35,671 --> 01:33:39,732
has agreed to finance the expansion of the James Holt label...

1298
01:33:39,842 --> 01:33:43,835
transforming the work of this visionary artist...

1299
01:33:43,946 --> 01:33:48,406
into a global brand, which is really an exciting enterprise.

1300
01:33:48,517 --> 01:33:52,578
Runway and James Holt share many things in common...

1301
01:33:52,688 --> 01:33:56,852
chief among them, a commitment to excellence.

1302
01:33:56,959 --> 01:34:01,726
And so, it should come as no surprise that when the time came...

1303
01:34:01,831 --> 01:34:06,393
for James to choose the new president of James Holt International...

1304
01:34:06,502 --> 01:34:09,437
he chose from within the Runway family.

1305
01:34:09,538 --> 01:34:13,599
And it's my great happiness today...

1306
01:34:13,709 --> 01:34:17,406
to announce to you all that that person...

1307
01:34:17,513 --> 01:34:22,883
is my friend and longtime esteemed colleague...

1308
01:34:22,985 --> 01:34:24,885
Jacqueline Follet.

1309
01:34:37,733 --> 01:34:39,667
Thank you. Merci.

1310
01:34:56,418 --> 01:34:59,114
And now to the main event...

1311
01:34:59,221 --> 01:35:02,452
our celebration of James Holt.

1312
01:35:02,558 --> 01:35:05,322
We at Runway are very proud to have been-

1313
01:35:07,029 --> 01:35:09,395
When the time is right, she'll pay me back.

1314
01:35:12,368 --> 01:35:14,893
You sure about that?

1315
01:35:15,004 --> 01:35:17,302
No.

1316
01:35:17,406 --> 01:35:20,432
But I hope for the best.

1317
01:35:20,543 --> 01:35:22,943
I have to.

1318
01:35:42,198 --> 01:35:44,393
You thought I didn't know.

1319
01:35:46,368 --> 01:35:49,895
I've known what was happening for quite some time.

1320
01:35:50,005 --> 01:35:55,568
It just took me a little while to find a suitable alternative for Jacqueline.

1321
01:35:55,678 --> 01:36:01,048
And that James Holtjob was so absurdly overpaid...

1322
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:03,880
that, of course, she jumped at it.

1323
01:36:03,986 --> 01:36:08,150
So I just had to tell Irv that Jacqueline was unavailable.

1324
01:36:08,257 --> 01:36:12,853
The truth is, there is no one that can do what I do...

1325
01:36:12,962 --> 01:36:15,590
including her.

1326
01:36:15,698 --> 01:36:19,190
Any of the other choices would have found that job impossible...

1327
01:36:19,301 --> 01:36:21,269
and the magazine would have suffered.

1328
01:36:21,370 --> 01:36:25,238
Especially because of the list.

1329
01:36:26,609 --> 01:36:30,170
The list of designers, photographers...

1330
01:36:30,279 --> 01:36:34,238
editors, writers, models, all of whom were found by me, nurtured by me...

1331
01:36:34,350 --> 01:36:37,183
and have promised me they will follow me...

1332
01:36:37,286 --> 01:36:40,414
whenever and if ever I choose to leave Runway.

1333
01:36:42,524 --> 01:36:44,617
So he reconsidered.

1334
01:36:48,330 --> 01:36:51,561
But I was very, very impressed...

1335
01:36:51,667 --> 01:36:54,693
by how intently you tried to warn me.

1336
01:36:54,803 --> 01:36:57,931
I never thought I would say this, Andrea...

1337
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:01,567
but I really-

1338
01:37:01,677 --> 01:37:03,941
I see a great deal of myself in you.

1339
01:37:07,449 --> 01:37:11,510
You can see beyond what people want and what they need...

1340
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:14,088
and you can choose for yourself.

1341
01:37:17,359 --> 01:37:21,318
I don't think I'm like that.

1342
01:37:21,430 --> 01:37:23,728
I-

1343
01:37:26,602 --> 01:37:28,502
I couldn't do what you did to Nigel, Miranda.

1344
01:37:28,604 --> 01:37:31,334
I couldn't do something like that.

1345
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:34,807
Mm. You already did.

1346
01:37:38,714 --> 01:37:40,614
To Emily.

1347
01:37:40,716 --> 01:37:44,413
That's not what I-

1348
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:46,920
No, that was- that was different. I didn't have a choice.

1349
01:37:47,022 --> 01:37:51,015
Oh, no, you chose. You chose to get ahead.

1350
01:37:51,126 --> 01:37:55,256
You want this life, those choices are necessary.

1351
01:37:55,364 --> 01:37:59,960
But what if this isn't what I want?

1352
01:38:00,069 --> 01:38:04,438
I mean, what if I don't wanna live the way you live?

1353
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:07,600
Don't be ridiculous, Andrea. Everybody wants this.

1354
01:38:09,712 --> 01:38:12,374
Everybody wants to be us.

1355
01:39:39,068 --> 01:39:42,902
I have to be at work in 20 minutes.

1356
01:39:43,005 --> 01:39:46,031
What's up?

1357
01:39:46,141 --> 01:39:49,076
Well, I just-

1358
01:39:49,178 --> 01:39:52,272
I wanted to say that you were right about everything.

1359
01:39:53,415 --> 01:39:55,508
That...

1360
01:39:55,617 --> 01:39:58,313
I turned my back on my friends and my family...

1361
01:39:58,420 --> 01:40:00,388
and everything I believed in...

1362
01:40:00,489 --> 01:40:03,481
and- and for what?

1363
01:40:03,592 --> 01:40:08,495
For shoes and shirts and jackets and belts.

1364
01:40:08,597 --> 01:40:10,724
Nate.

1365
01:40:14,103 --> 01:40:16,003
I'm sorry.

1366
01:40:24,113 --> 01:40:26,343
I-

1367
01:40:26,448 --> 01:40:28,609
I flew up to Boston while you were gone.

1368
01:40:28,717 --> 01:40:31,311
I interviewed at the Oak Room.

1369
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:33,854
And?

1370
01:40:35,157 --> 01:40:37,921
And you're looking at their new sous-chef.

1371
01:40:38,026 --> 01:40:41,860
- I'm moving up there in a couple weeks. - That's great. Congratulations.

1372
01:40:47,302 --> 01:40:50,760
I don't know what I'm gonna do without those late-night grilled cheeses, but-

1373
01:40:50,873 --> 01:40:54,934
I'm pretty sure they have bread in Boston.

1374
01:40:55,043 --> 01:40:57,273
May even have Jarlsberg.

1375
01:41:00,482 --> 01:41:02,780
We might be able to figure something out.

1376
01:41:04,953 --> 01:41:06,853
You think?

1377
01:41:06,955 --> 01:41:08,855
Yeah.

1378
01:41:15,764 --> 01:41:19,291
So, what about you? I mean, what are you gonna do now?

1379
01:41:19,401 --> 01:41:22,734
Actually, I, uh- I have a job interview today.

1380
01:41:22,838 --> 01:41:25,272
- Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm.

1381
01:41:25,374 --> 01:41:27,638
That's what you're wearing?

1382
01:41:27,743 --> 01:41:30,678
Shut up. I like this.

1383
01:41:34,816 --> 01:41:36,716
- Andy, Greg Hill. - Hello.

1384
01:41:36,818 --> 01:41:39,218
Come on. These clips are excellent.

1385
01:41:39,321 --> 01:41:42,222
This thing on the janitors' union, that's exactly what we do here.

1386
01:41:42,324 --> 01:41:45,259
My only question is, Runway?

1387
01:41:45,394 --> 01:41:48,022
You were there for less than a year.

1388
01:41:48,130 --> 01:41:50,098
What the hell kind of a blip is that?

1389
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:53,391
Learned a lot.

1390
01:41:55,270 --> 01:42:00,264
In the end though, I kind of screwed it up.

1391
01:42:00,375 --> 01:42:03,867
I called over there for a reference, left word with some snooty girl.

1392
01:42:03,979 --> 01:42:07,540
Next thing you know, I got a fax from Miranda Priestly herself...

1393
01:42:07,649 --> 01:42:10,174
saying that of all the assistants she's ever had...

1394
01:42:10,285 --> 01:42:12,515
you were, by far, her biggest disappointment.

1395
01:42:12,621 --> 01:42:17,786
And, if I don't hire you, I am an idiot.

1396
01:42:20,329 --> 01:42:22,923
You must have done something right.

1397
01:42:54,930 --> 01:42:56,830
Miranda Priestly's office.

1398
01:42:56,932 --> 01:43:02,131
Hey, Emily, it's Andy. Don't hang up. I have a favor to ask you.

1399
01:43:02,237 --> 01:43:05,001
You have a favor to ask of me?

1400
01:43:05,107 --> 01:43:08,372
Yeah. The thing is, I have all these clothes from Paris...

1401
01:43:08,477 --> 01:43:10,502
and I don't have anyplace to wear them...

1402
01:43:10,612 --> 01:43:14,742
so I was wondering if you could take them off my hands.

1403
01:43:19,054 --> 01:43:23,047
Well, I don't know. It's a huge imposition.

1404
01:43:23,158 --> 01:43:27,356
And I'll have to get them taken in. I mean, they'll drown me.

1405
01:43:27,462 --> 01:43:31,922
But I suppose I could help you out. I will have Roy pick them up this afternoon.

1406
01:43:32,034 --> 01:43:36,630
Thanks, Em. I appreciate it. Good luck.

1407
01:43:46,548 --> 01:43:49,608
You have some very large shoes to fill.

1408
01:43:49,718 --> 01:43:53,176
I hope you know that.

1409
01:43:58,593 --> 01:44:02,051
I don't understand why it is so challenging...

1410
01:44:02,164 --> 01:44:05,759
to get my car when I ask for it.

1411
01:44:51,146 --> 01:44:53,137
Go.
