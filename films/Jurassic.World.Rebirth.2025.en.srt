We keep running it

Here we go.

13
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,438
Oh. Yeah. Sorry. Hold on.

14
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:27,974
Okay. Yeah.

I didn't see
the labs, but I assume

we upped the soporifics?

19
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:49,363
Yeah.
I'm gonna have to go as high

to kill the thing.

Oh, no!

Come on, what is this?

completely cleared
two years ago.

Yeah, well, I'm not
happy about it either, man.

They're trying to get him up
right now.

I don't know what you want me
to tell you.

thought to be
the last surviving

- Back to you, Bob.
-Thanks, Hailey.

So, yeah,
the aging brachiosaur,
known to be in poor health,

78
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,251
broke out of
the Cobble Hill Park enclosure

79
00:06:33,386 --> 00:06:35,523
where it had been living while
receiving medical attention.

Oh, for God's sake.

Damn, that's cold.

83
00:06:55,672 --> 00:06:57,041
Geez.

84
00:06:57,176 --> 00:06:59,483
I mean, even for New York,
it's pretty cold.

85
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,183
Miss Bennett, I presume?

86
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:05,719
Hello.

87
00:07:05,855 --> 00:07:07,720
Weren't we supposed
to meet at the, um...

88
00:07:07,855 --> 00:07:09,889
You're not exactly
hard to follow.

89
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:14,793
- So, how did you hear about me?
- Paulo Pasolini, Blackwater.

90
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:16,930
Mm-hmm. Does he have
a message for me?

91
00:07:17,065 --> 00:07:20,928
Yes. He said to say,
"Felix isn't himself today."

92
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:23,002
Um... okay, I'm listening.

93
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:25,476
Is that some spy stuff?
'Cause that is fantastic.

94
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:29,445
What is it that you do
at ParkerGenix?

95
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:32,313
My company is developing
a new medication,

96
00:07:32,448 --> 00:07:34,150
and we have certain needs.

97
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:35,616
Uh-huh. That sounds vague.

98
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:38,081
And what does that mean
in this case?

99
00:07:38,217 --> 00:07:39,487
They say you're good
at procuring things

100
00:07:39,622 --> 00:07:40,991
and not asking
a lot of questions.

101
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:42,721
Do they?

102
00:07:42,856 --> 00:07:44,284
They also say you're untroubled

103
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,794
by possible legal
or ethical implications.

104
00:07:48,597 --> 00:07:50,200
Well, they need to shut up.

105
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,630
Well, take it as a compliment.

106
00:07:51,765 --> 00:07:54,164
Uh, means you get the job done.

107
00:07:55,197 --> 00:07:56,866
I lost a friend on my last job,

108
00:07:57,001 --> 00:07:58,639
so I am not up for procurement.

109
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:00,469
Well, you don't know
what it is yet.

110
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,243
Yes, but you work for a
pharmaceutical company, right?

111
00:08:02,378 --> 00:08:04,105
So... You called me.

112
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,907
I'm spec ops, so it's covert.

113
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:08,884
I'm guessing info theft?

114
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:13,815
I-I'm sorry, I do retrieval
and extractions, not heists.

115
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,716
It's dinosaurs.

116
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:18,160
They may be through with us,
but we're not
through with them.

117
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:19,858
Well, they are all...

118
00:08:19,993 --> 00:08:21,862
They're all dead
or dying, so...

119
00:08:21,997 --> 00:08:24,667
Except for on a few islands
around the equator.

120
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:28,302
Yes, and those are no-go zones
for a reason.

121
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:30,030
You go there, you die.

122
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,206
Which is where you come in.

123
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:34,207
Oh.

124
00:08:34,343 --> 00:08:35,876
No, thanks.

125
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,781
Ms. Bennett!

126
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:41,679
Did you know that
20% of the world's population

127
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:43,246
will die of heart disease?

128
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:45,312
That's one in every five people
on the planet.

129
00:08:45,448 --> 00:08:47,186
Now, just imagine.
Take somebody you know,

130
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:49,122
anybody, and imagine that you
could be the one to give them

131
00:08:49,258 --> 00:08:50,921
- an extra 20 years of life.
- That's very touching.

132
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:52,394
It's not my field, though.

133
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,993
And we have very deep pockets.

134
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:03,304
How deep?

135
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:05,169
For you, extremely.

136
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:07,705
Well...

137
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:10,013
I'm gonna need a number.

138
00:09:10,148 --> 00:09:11,978
Ten, six zeros.

139
00:09:13,476 --> 00:09:15,247
Including the one
that's in the ten?

140
00:09:15,382 --> 00:09:16,620
No.

141
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:20,252
It's a fortune, Ms. Bennett.

142
00:09:20,388 --> 00:09:22,084
The kind of money that would
mean you'd never have to put

143
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:24,289
your life on the line
ever again.

144
00:09:26,057 --> 00:09:27,262
All right, what's the hitch?

145
00:09:27,397 --> 00:09:29,023
Uh...

146
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,463
Possible criminal charges.

147
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:32,626
We are going to a place

148
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:36,673
where every government on
the planet has outlawed travel.

149
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,468
Well, we better not
tell anyone, then.

150
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,609
Yeah, that might be a problem.

151
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:49,552
He doesn't know it yet,
but we're bringing a civilian.

152
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,920
The Neo-Jurassic Age

153
00:09:56,056 --> 00:09:59,021
has proven lethal
to Dinosauria.

154
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:01,258
Though some species can survive

155
00:10:01,394 --> 00:10:05,062
in a few isolated oxygen-rich
tropical microclimates

156
00:10:05,198 --> 00:10:07,469
clustered in
equatorial regions,

157
00:10:07,605 --> 00:10:09,265
where interactions with humans

158
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,273
and other incompatible
modern species is...

159
00:10:19,484 --> 00:10:21,449
Banner coming down.

160
00:10:23,182 --> 00:10:25,185
Okay, so this is
the left metacarpal?

161
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:26,789
Yeah.

162
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:32,086
Good morning, Doctor.

163
00:10:32,222 --> 00:10:34,021
Sorry to drop in unannounced.

164
00:10:34,156 --> 00:10:35,322
Can we have a word?

165
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,959
Sorry, it's a hell
of a day here.

166
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,467
They're closing us down.

167
00:10:38,602 --> 00:10:40,371
Dr. Henry Loomis, Zora Bennett,

168
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:41,501
- our mission specialist.
- Hello.

169
00:10:41,636 --> 00:10:43,168
Sorry, what mission?

170
00:10:44,634 --> 00:10:47,510
Uh, guys, why don't
you just take a break

171
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:49,675
for a minute, okay?

172
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,339
Thanks, guys.

173
00:10:51,475 --> 00:10:53,344
Dr. Loomis has been
advising ParkerGenix

174
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:55,509
for the past six months
on paleo-coronary health.

175
00:10:55,645 --> 00:10:57,316
We're developing a new drug,
Paleodioxin,

176
00:10:57,451 --> 00:11:00,019
derived from the largest
dinosaur species on record.

177
00:11:00,154 --> 00:11:02,582
Computer modeling suggests
it could forestall

178
00:11:02,718 --> 00:11:05,190
coronary disease
by an average of two decades.

179
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:07,456
Think what that might have
meant for your mother.

180
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:09,364
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
-  Okay.

181
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,699
Anybody can read a file.

182
00:11:10,835 --> 00:11:12,667
If you get personal, though,
I'm out.

183
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:14,404
I'm sorry for overstepping.

184
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,539
This, uh, research is crucial.

185
00:11:16,674 --> 00:11:18,333
We just can't get it to trial.

186
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,236
We're unable
to synthesize the DNA,

187
00:11:20,372 --> 00:11:22,777
so we need samples
from living dinosaurs.

188
00:11:22,913 --> 00:11:25,882
And the species must be
a true colossus.

189
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:28,044
It's the biggest animals
across three categories:

190
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:30,945
seagoing, land based and avian.

191
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,718
Why the biggest?

192
00:11:32,854 --> 00:11:34,551
Oh, it's their hearts.

193
00:11:34,687 --> 00:11:37,558
The bigger they were, the
bigger their coronary muscles.

194
00:11:37,694 --> 00:11:39,325
And they lived the longest,

195
00:11:39,461 --> 00:11:42,689
over a hundred years for
some Cretaceous-era sauropods.

196
00:11:42,824 --> 00:11:47,362
Which means the three
dinosaurs they need are

197
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:52,770
Mosasaurus,
which lives in the ocean,

198
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:56,346
and Titanosaurus.

199
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,782
You'll find them on land.

200
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,245
And in the sky, Quetzalcoatlus.

201
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,887
It's the largest pterosaur.

202
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:08,583
Each of them had
an average lifespan

203
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:10,886
of well over a century,
even before DNA refinement.

204
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,389
Mm.

205
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:13,929
A drug that could prevent
heart disease would be

206
00:12:14,064 --> 00:12:15,789
the biggest
medical breakthrough
in centuries.

207
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:19,995
Yeah. And I'm sure it'd be
worth billions, right?

208
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,862
- Trillions.
- Hmm.

209
00:12:21,997 --> 00:12:24,072
The only way for our scientists
to complete the strands now

210
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:28,436
is with blood
and tissue samples
from living dinosaurs.

211
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:31,045
Wait. Y-You want
to take blood samples

212
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,213
from these animals
while they're alive?

213
00:12:33,349 --> 00:12:35,950
Hemoglobin deoxygenates
within seconds postmortem.

214
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:39,119
Lividity and hypostasis
follow immediately.

215
00:12:40,254 --> 00:12:43,118
Fortunately for us,
all these species exist

216
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:45,419
in one isolated location.

217
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:46,828
We're putting together a team,

218
00:12:46,964 --> 00:12:48,529
and we'd like
to leave immediately.

219
00:12:48,664 --> 00:12:50,096
We have competitors,

220
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:53,062
and Mr. Parker does not
tolerate second place.

221
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:54,302
Can you be ready tomorrow?

222
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:56,268
Dr. Loomis?

223
00:12:58,842 --> 00:13:00,167
I thought I was just advising.

224
00:13:00,302 --> 00:13:02,340
You are. In person.

225
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:04,578
We're not qualified
to identify the animals

226
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:06,546
or predict behavior.

227
00:13:06,682 --> 00:13:07,785
Well...

228
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,784
Why don't you send an army?

229
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,981
You're a rich company.

230
00:13:13,116 --> 00:13:14,957
Confidentiality.

231
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:17,592
The fewer people know
about this, the better.

232
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:19,419
I can guarantee your safety.

233
00:13:19,554 --> 00:13:21,396
I mean, you know, more or less.

234
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:23,224
Oh, no, no. It's not about
my safety. It's just, it's...

235
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:25,198
- "More or less"?
- Yeah.

236
00:13:29,734 --> 00:13:32,600
What you're proposing
is really illegal.

237
00:13:32,736 --> 00:13:35,436
Oh, did we-- did you tell him
about the zeros?

238
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:36,513
That's not gonna work with him.

239
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:38,279
What are you talking about?

240
00:13:40,984 --> 00:13:43,348
You ever seen a dinosaur
in the wild?

241
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:46,452
I don't mean in a theme park
when you were a kid

242
00:13:46,588 --> 00:13:50,351
or watching some poor creature
wander around town lost.

243
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:53,094
I mean in its natural habitat.

244
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:56,458
'Cause until you've done that,

245
00:13:56,593 --> 00:13:58,759
you're just a guy
who visits zoos.

246
00:14:13,984 --> 00:14:16,854
We sold a dozen tickets
all last week.

247
00:14:19,214 --> 00:14:22,283
Five years ago, you'd have
to wait in line for hours,

248
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:24,059
if you could even get in.

249
00:14:27,394 --> 00:14:29,757
Nobody cares about
these animals anymore.

250
00:14:31,635 --> 00:14:33,167
They deserve better.

251
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,737
I just-- I need a second.

252
00:14:36,873 --> 00:14:39,236
No, yeah.  Take...

253
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:41,601
Take all the time
that you need.

254
00:14:41,736 --> 00:14:43,379
Take all the minutes.
Not like...

255
00:14:45,475 --> 00:14:46,749
...your entire life has been,

256
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:49,144
you know, leading up
to this moment.

257
00:15:09,037 --> 00:15:11,271
- You ready?
- Yeah.

258
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,447
Three in a row!

259
00:16:00,582 --> 00:16:02,619
Captain Kincaid.

260
00:16:04,793 --> 00:16:06,563
Martin Krebs.

261
00:16:06,698 --> 00:16:08,293
We spoke on the phone.

262
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:11,969
Yeah, Krebs, look, I'm sorry.

263
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,962
I thought it over,
and I can't do it.

264
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:19,739
I'd like to, just as a favor
to Zora, but I can't.

265
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,474
What?

266
00:16:23,474 --> 00:16:26,049
We already agreed on the phone.

267
00:16:27,146 --> 00:16:28,409
You named your price.

268
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:29,985
It's not that. I just--

269
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:31,879
It's a little too risky
for my boat.

270
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,691
She's not paid off yet,
so I imagine you understand.

271
00:16:36,826 --> 00:16:38,225
No hard feelings, Z.

272
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,622
Hey. Two double rums. <i>Merci.</i>

273
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:42,966
What the hell is this?
He's your guy.

274
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:46,831
Yeah. We spent ten years
in MARSOC together.

275
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:48,670
Duncan's the best.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

276
00:16:48,806 --> 00:16:50,466
Best at what? Drinking?

277
00:16:50,602 --> 00:16:53,036
Fabrice, not the guns, okay?

278
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:54,472
All right. Okay.

279
00:16:54,607 --> 00:16:57,008
Moving things and people
in and out of places

280
00:16:57,144 --> 00:16:58,776
they shouldn't be.

281
00:16:58,911 --> 00:17:00,681
Trouble is, I really
can't do it this time, Z.

282
00:17:00,816 --> 00:17:02,379
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:03,911
And I'm afraid that's final.

284
00:17:04,046 --> 00:17:06,379
That's a hell
of a setback, Duncan.

285
00:17:06,514 --> 00:17:07,514
You promised me.

286
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,653
Uh, we're screwed now.

287
00:17:12,025 --> 00:17:13,490
I'm sorry.

288
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:15,989
I hate to see this
all fall apart on you.

289
00:17:19,596 --> 00:17:21,468
I'll tell you what.

290
00:17:21,603 --> 00:17:24,537
Why don't you make some sort
of good faith gesture?

291
00:17:24,672 --> 00:17:27,269
Like, maybe-- you know,
I'm just spitballing here--

292
00:17:27,404 --> 00:17:29,441
but maybe you could

293
00:17:29,577 --> 00:17:31,078
double the number
that you and I spoke about,

294
00:17:31,213 --> 00:17:32,539
and then I can
take care of Duncan

295
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:33,880
and his crew out of my end.

296
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:35,885
Oh, I see.

297
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,879
That's very nice.

298
00:17:38,014 --> 00:17:39,715
You guys cook this up
on the phone or just now?

299
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,256
Oh, I'm just trying
to help you out.

300
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:44,122
I don't have to sit here
and be insulted.

301
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:46,795
For God sakes, fine. Agreed.

302
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:48,864
- Great.
- Great.

303
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,258
We'll loop up toward Barbados

304
00:17:52,394 --> 00:17:56,304
to avoid government patrols,
but there aren't many anyway.

305
00:17:58,533 --> 00:17:59,967
Why's that?

306
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:05,913
No one's dumb enough
to go where we're going.

307
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,614
Hey! Hey!

308
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,218
Come here!

309
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:14,490
- Hey.
-Hey.

310
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,758
Over here.

311
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,222
- Hey, Z.
-  Hi.

312
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:19,124
- Hey, how you been?
- Oh, good.

313
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:20,888
Bobby Atwater.

314
00:18:21,024 --> 00:18:22,730
He'll be helping
with team security.

315
00:18:22,865 --> 00:18:24,595
Security for...?

316
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:27,027
Make sure you don't end up
in one of these.

317
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,836
A live one.

318
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,412
Is there anything else?

319
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:39,643
Yeah, listen, I'm not gonna be
able to do this, you know?

320
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:41,416
I-I would love to as a favor
for you, Z, but...

321
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:43,747
- Oh, no, we ran it already.
- All right, cool.

322
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,447
So, when we leaving?

323
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,204
-Hey, LeClerc.
- LeCLERC: What?

324
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:02,838
Did you see how much
Kincaid's paying us

325
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:04,600
for this one?

326
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:06,470
Oh, yeah.

327
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:08,171
- We're in trouble.
- Hell yeah.

328
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,612
Well, the good news is,

329
00:19:16,748 --> 00:19:18,848
the Mosasaur was tagged
in captivity

330
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:21,818
and InGen continued to track it
after its escape.

331
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,649
We bought their data
when they entered Chapter 11,

332
00:19:23,785 --> 00:19:25,019
so now we track it.

333
00:19:25,154 --> 00:19:27,255
Nobody else seems to know
much about it.

334
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,194
But...

335
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,132
that's it right there.

336
00:19:31,268 --> 00:19:34,694
So, first sample
in 150 miles or so.

337
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,470
Very close to the equator.

338
00:19:37,537 --> 00:19:39,042
But why...
why near the equator?

339
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,837
Why don't they survive
anywhere else?

340
00:19:42,106 --> 00:19:45,375
The fitness landscape of
the Earth no longer suits them.

341
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:47,842
Uh, the air is different.

342
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:49,378
Uh, the solar radiation
is different,

343
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:50,984
the insects, vegetation.

344
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,514
Everything is different.

345
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,114
But close to the equator,

346
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,554
it's nearly the climate
of 60 million years ago.

347
00:19:56,689 --> 00:19:58,292
It's warmer
and rich with oxygen.

348
00:19:58,428 --> 00:20:01,063
And the Mosasaur
generally circles

349
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:02,660
the island we're headed to.

350
00:20:02,795 --> 00:20:05,592
There's a complex there
that was R and D

351
00:20:05,727 --> 00:20:08,104
for the original park.

352
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:12,671
It was abandoned
after an accident.

353
00:20:15,207 --> 00:20:16,903
We're gonna want to get in,
get our three samples

354
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,677
and get out
as quickly as possible.

355
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:21,351
Because even though
two dozen species

356
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:25,554
have survived there, alone,
for almost 20 years,

357
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,854
make no mistake, this is by no
means a controlled environment.

358
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:32,790
Yeah, I think we'll be okay.

359
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,358
What are those?

360
00:20:35,494 --> 00:20:37,295
Neurotoxins.

361
00:20:37,431 --> 00:20:38,797
How fast?

362
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:41,495
Paralysis within
a couple of seconds.

363
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,734
And then what?

364
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,441
And then you survive.

365
00:20:52,842 --> 00:20:54,715
Is this the part where you, uh,

366
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:56,543
tell me it's a crime
to kill a dinosaur, Doctor?

367
00:20:56,678 --> 00:21:00,051
No, this is where I tell you
it's a sin to kill a dinosaur.

368
00:21:04,758 --> 00:21:08,930
So, uh, what if
it's us or them? Hmm?

369
00:21:09,065 --> 00:21:12,062
Then we've put ourselves in
a place where we don't belong.

370
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:16,570
Mm, that's-that's kind of
our specialty, Dr. Loomis.

371
00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:20,233
We have no intention
of harming the animals.

372
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:23,236
Let's just get our samples
and go home.

373
00:21:23,371 --> 00:21:25,678
Gonna lose the light
before we make contact.

374
00:21:25,813 --> 00:21:27,746
We'll make a run
first thing in the morning.

375
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:30,549
How does extraction work?

376
00:21:30,685 --> 00:21:32,912
These darts
collect blood samples.

377
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:34,288
You get one shot with each.

378
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:35,819
The Mosa has
four inches of hide,

379
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:39,252
so you must be within
ten meters to penetrate.

380
00:21:40,598 --> 00:21:43,462
And it self-ejects
when it reaches capacity.

381
00:21:43,597 --> 00:21:45,563
It should fire

382
00:21:45,699 --> 00:21:47,133
a couple of hundred feet
in the air,

383
00:21:47,268 --> 00:21:48,470
like a model rocket.

384
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:53,935
On the day,
a parachute will open,

385
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:55,603
and it will float back down
to us.

386
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:57,213
I'll take the shot.

387
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,015
Uh, remote biopsy darting
is pretty basic.

388
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:01,780
I'm sure I can handle it.

389
00:22:02,786 --> 00:22:03,685
Oh.

390
00:22:06,421 --> 00:22:07,885
Let me show you something.

391
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,959
- You feel that spray?
- Yeah.

392
00:22:15,095 --> 00:22:17,800
Now imagine the boat
rocking at 15 to 20 degrees,

393
00:22:17,935 --> 00:22:20,527
we're moving at 30 knots, you
got sweat running in your eyes,

394
00:22:20,662 --> 00:22:24,004
and you're close enough to look
that thing right in the teeth.

395
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:25,375
You got this.

396
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:33,213
Uh, please, be my guest.

397
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:35,781
Oh, really? If you insist.

398
00:22:42,392 --> 00:22:44,954
I can't take it.

399
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,830
I mean, it's-it's been fun
working with you, Z.

400
00:22:48,966 --> 00:22:51,867
- What?
- But I think we just
found our new team leader.

401
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,265
No offense.

402
00:22:55,401 --> 00:22:58,071
I mean, I don't know anybody
that could be offended by that.

403
00:22:58,207 --> 00:22:59,409
That's mean.

404
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:06,981
I heard about Booker.

405
00:23:09,712 --> 00:23:11,282
Yeah.

406
00:23:11,418 --> 00:23:13,016
I'm so sorry.

407
00:23:14,023 --> 00:23:15,458
Yeah.

408
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,560
What job were you on?

409
00:23:19,695 --> 00:23:23,796
Um, just a simple
training mission in Yemen.

410
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:27,536
Couldn't have been more basic.
Just a car bomb.

411
00:23:29,072 --> 00:23:30,539
Out of nowhere.

412
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,510
Quick at least.

413
00:23:37,245 --> 00:23:39,046
Not really.

414
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:40,780
Shit.

415
00:23:42,517 --> 00:23:44,586
He didn't deserve that.

416
00:23:46,351 --> 00:23:47,888
No.

417
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:53,061
I had to tell his wife.

418
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:55,397
It was... it was brutal.

419
00:23:55,532 --> 00:23:56,831
You can't keep this up
forever, Z.

420
00:23:56,966 --> 00:23:57,932
No.

421
00:23:58,068 --> 00:24:00,399
This work...

422
00:24:00,535 --> 00:24:02,294
it breaks you eventually.

423
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,738
What do you think
I'm doing down here?

424
00:24:04,874 --> 00:24:07,937
I'm just trying to,
you know, buy my life back.

425
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:10,507
Oh, really?
I thought you just missed me.

426
00:24:10,643 --> 00:24:12,908
Well...

427
00:24:13,043 --> 00:24:14,442
You know
what I actually missed?

428
00:24:14,577 --> 00:24:15,848
Hmm?

429
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:18,312
My own mother's funeral.

430
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:20,382
Oh, wow.

431
00:24:20,518 --> 00:24:21,783
Yeah.

432
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,721
That's terrible, Zora.

433
00:24:23,856 --> 00:24:25,719
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, seriously.

434
00:24:25,854 --> 00:24:27,694
That's, like, the worst thing
I've ever heard anybody do.

435
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:29,963
Thank you.
That's so supportive of you.

436
00:24:30,098 --> 00:24:31,765
Oh.

437
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,570
God.

438
00:24:40,976 --> 00:24:43,546
Please tell me
you worked it out with Amelia.

439
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,685
Well...

440
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:56,185
Whenever we looked
at each other, we just...

441
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,222
...just saw our little boy.

442
00:25:03,262 --> 00:25:06,360
Easier for us both just
to go at it alone, you know?

443
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,408
We are very pathetic.

444
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,441
All right, what do you say
we stay alive?

445
00:25:22,577 --> 00:25:27,315
And, uh, you know,
get rich this time.

446
00:25:28,692 --> 00:25:30,992
Rich is nice,
but it won't be enough.

447
00:25:31,127 --> 00:25:32,894
For sure.

448
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:36,062
Do something that matters
while there's still time.

449
00:25:36,198 --> 00:25:37,391
Okay.

450
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:39,129
Don't just brush that off.
I mean it.

451
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,003
Don't wait, Zora.

452
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:43,531
Do not wait.

453
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,612
♪ We took a vow in summertime ♪

454
00:25:59,747 --> 00:26:03,417
♪ Now we find ourselves
in late December... ♪

455
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:08,059
You rationing those, honey?

456
00:26:09,497 --> 00:26:10,892
I'm enjoying them.

457
00:26:12,562 --> 00:26:14,065
It's a long way
across the Atlantic.

458
00:26:14,201 --> 00:26:16,804
You're gonna miss them
when you run out.

459
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,106
Can I ask why you have
so many in your pocket?

460
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,112
So she doesn't eat them.

461
00:26:25,247 --> 00:26:27,213
Ah, right.

462
00:26:27,349 --> 00:26:28,547
Hey, honey.

463
00:26:28,683 --> 00:26:30,078
Where's your boyfriend?

464
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:31,747
It-It's his turn at the wheel.

465
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:33,088
Is he coming or what?

466
00:26:33,223 --> 00:26:34,786
Uh, I told him.

467
00:26:34,921 --> 00:26:36,626
He's just getting dressed.

468
00:26:37,754 --> 00:26:38,786
Okay.

469
00:26:38,921 --> 00:26:40,393
Okay.

470
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:42,459
Do you want to practice?

471
00:26:42,594 --> 00:26:43,725
All right.

472
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,731
Remember, okay?

473
00:26:45,867 --> 00:26:47,235
It's just like Dad showed you.

474
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:49,637
Under, under, around.

475
00:26:49,773 --> 00:26:51,304
You guys ever wish
you had a boring dad?

476
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,942
- We do.
- Yeah.

477
00:26:56,905 --> 00:26:58,208
Finally.

478
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,748
Good evening, Xavier.

479
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:06,152
What's up?

480
00:27:06,288 --> 00:27:08,257
6:00.

481
00:27:08,392 --> 00:27:10,651
I know.

482
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,430
I was out cold.

483
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:15,924
It's, uh, it's your watch.

484
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:18,668
Oh, I-I slept like a baby.

485
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:22,837
You've-you've got the wheel?

486
00:27:24,605 --> 00:27:28,001
Man, I am so tired.

487
00:27:28,137 --> 00:27:29,336
I'm gonna be honest.

488
00:27:29,472 --> 00:27:30,842
I'd probably conk out
at the wheel.

489
00:27:30,978 --> 00:27:32,682
I'll take his shift. It's fine.

490
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,976
No, no, no, honey,
we've been through this.

491
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,883
You need sleep. I need sleep.

492
00:27:37,018 --> 00:27:39,149
It's your shift, Xavier.
Come on, man.

493
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:43,793
Reuben, can't we just anchor,
for once?

494
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:46,760
Use the anchor.
We haven't done that yet.

495
00:27:46,896 --> 00:27:49,960
We only carry 50 meters
of anchor chain.

496
00:27:50,096 --> 00:27:52,695
It's 2,000 meters
to the bottom.

497
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,495
Oh.

498
00:27:55,931 --> 00:27:57,639
Kind of sounds like somebody
should've thought about that

499
00:27:57,774 --> 00:27:59,131
- before we left.
- Do you have any idea

500
00:27:59,267 --> 00:28:00,300
the weight of two thou--

501
00:28:00,435 --> 00:28:01,944
I built this boat,
okay, Xavier?

502
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,845
- I-I know what I'm doing.
- Oh, so you're good.

503
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,307
- You're good on the wheel.
- You know what?

504
00:28:05,443 --> 00:28:07,246
Just grab another hour.
I'm-I'm fine.

505
00:28:07,382 --> 00:28:09,480
- Yes. Perfect. You're the best.
- I-I got it. I'm fine.

506
00:28:09,615 --> 00:28:11,054
Fist bump?

507
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,220
Give me some.

508
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:14,052
Never mind. Whoa.

509
00:28:14,188 --> 00:28:17,650
Oh, you got licorice, dude?
I love this stuff.

510
00:28:28,934 --> 00:28:30,997
I didn't say a word.

511
00:28:31,133 --> 00:28:32,502
Not-not one word.

512
00:28:32,638 --> 00:28:33,974
Good.

513
00:28:34,971 --> 00:28:36,372
So don't.

514
00:28:38,815 --> 00:28:40,511
What-- did-did he even
bring a shirt?

515
00:28:40,647 --> 00:28:44,384
Okay, clearly you don't see
the side of him that I see.

516
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:45,979
The naked side.

517
00:28:46,114 --> 00:28:47,487
Hey.

518
00:28:47,623 --> 00:28:49,257
I mean, I...

519
00:28:49,392 --> 00:28:51,888
I guess I'd hoped it
would just be the three of us.

520
00:28:52,023 --> 00:28:54,728
You know, one last hurrah.

521
00:28:54,863 --> 00:28:58,361
I'm going to NYU, not Mongolia.

522
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,067
I know. You're right.

523
00:29:06,673 --> 00:29:07,737
What are those?

524
00:29:11,072 --> 00:29:12,749
Where?

525
00:29:18,051 --> 00:29:20,552
One o'clock. Moving east.

526
00:29:20,687 --> 00:29:21,982
Dolphins?

527
00:29:22,117 --> 00:29:23,289
No.

528
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:25,786
No fins.

529
00:29:25,922 --> 00:29:27,390
Sails.

530
00:29:36,198 --> 00:29:38,401
Bella, grab the wheel.

531
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:48,314
Left, left, left.

532
00:29:57,485 --> 00:29:58,655
Something big sideswiped us.

533
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,961
Sailfish?

534
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,726
Bigger.

535
00:30:01,862 --> 00:30:04,261
Is it the you-know-what?

536
00:30:04,397 --> 00:30:06,961
No, hon,
it's not a you-know-what.

537
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,295
Barely any left.

538
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,263
I hate those things.

539
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,533
I wish they never came back.

540
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:14,700
I just think we should...

541
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,284
Hold on!

542
00:30:33,156 --> 00:30:35,626
- Dad! Dad!
- Teresa!

543
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:38,157
- Xavier's inside!
- I'll get him. Get to the top.

544
00:30:38,292 --> 00:30:39,968
Get to the top!

545
00:30:42,264 --> 00:30:43,897
Swim!

546
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:45,368
Xavier!

547
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,808
- It's not opening!
- Let it fill with water!

548
00:30:46,944 --> 00:30:48,374
- Reuben, it won't open!
- Let it fill!

549
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,842
- Let it fill, then
you can open the door!
- Why?

550
00:30:49,978 --> 00:30:51,778
Get the radio! In the red bag!

551
00:30:51,913 --> 00:30:53,482
The red bag! The emergency bag!

552
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:56,347
- Get up!
- Okay.

553
00:30:58,851 --> 00:31:00,148
Go!

554
00:31:00,283 --> 00:31:01,550
- Where is it?
- Get it!

555
00:31:01,686 --> 00:31:02,857
- I can't find it!
- It's in the bag!

556
00:31:02,993 --> 00:31:04,788
The emergency bag!
The emergency radio!

557
00:31:04,923 --> 00:31:06,654
Okay.

558
00:31:08,122 --> 00:31:10,333
Dad!

559
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,894
Xavier!

560
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,533
Hey! Just get out!

561
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:36,926
- Teresa!
- Bella! Bella, hold on!

562
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,071
- Xavier!
- Xavier!

563
00:31:51,673 --> 00:31:52,999
- Dad!
- Dad!

564
00:31:53,134 --> 00:31:55,003
Dad!

565
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:57,509
- Xavier!
- Dad!

566
00:31:57,644 --> 00:31:58,578
Dad!

567
00:31:58,714 --> 00:31:59,940
Honey!

568
00:32:00,075 --> 00:32:02,077
Dad!

569
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:03,913
Where's Xavier?

570
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:05,415
What happened?

571
00:32:05,551 --> 00:32:08,257
- Dad, where is he?
- I don't know.

572
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:12,086
I'll go back down.
I'll keep looking.

573
00:32:14,761 --> 00:32:15,761
Xavier!

574
00:32:15,897 --> 00:32:17,725
Xavier!

575
00:32:19,095 --> 00:32:20,261
Xavier!

576
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,064
- Xavier, swim!
- Hey! Hey!

577
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:24,638
Xavier, hurry! Swim!

578
00:32:24,773 --> 00:32:25,901
- Xavier!
- Come on!

579
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,645
- Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Swim, Xavier!

580
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:32,679
- Faster! Come on!
- Hurry!

581
00:32:32,814 --> 00:32:34,282
Xavier!

582
00:32:34,418 --> 00:32:35,908
Come on!

583
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:46,457
Dad.

584
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:53,402
I...

585
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,103
I got the bag.

586
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,275
♪ Money rains... ♪

587
00:33:10,552 --> 00:33:13,422
♪ But keep the change
'Cause I've got enough ♪

588
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,053
♪ A little time... ♪

589
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,171
Am I interrupting?

590
00:33:31,608 --> 00:33:33,035
Oh.

591
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,736
It's fine.

592
00:33:35,978 --> 00:33:37,708
I can't sleep.

593
00:33:37,844 --> 00:33:40,605
Well, they say if
you can sleep the night before,

594
00:33:40,741 --> 00:33:42,447
you should probably quit.

595
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,483
You don't hear that much
in museum work.

596
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:48,354
You want to sit down?

597
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,392
Can I ask
what was bothering you?

598
00:33:59,527 --> 00:34:01,401
Maybe a little PTSD.

599
00:34:01,536 --> 00:34:03,868
I probably should've taken
some more time off

600
00:34:04,004 --> 00:34:05,569
after my last job.

601
00:34:09,811 --> 00:34:11,311
What are you?

602
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,215
Like a mercenary?

603
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,450
Uh, situational security
and reaction.

604
00:34:22,484 --> 00:34:23,689
So a mercenary, then.

605
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,696
Well, still, sounds way more
exciting than my life.

606
00:34:29,831 --> 00:34:30,795
Yeah?

607
00:34:30,931 --> 00:34:32,692
How exactly?

608
00:34:32,827 --> 00:34:35,500
Well, I have never
been shot at.

609
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,440
- No?
- Mm-mm.

610
00:34:39,576 --> 00:34:40,835
Well...

611
00:34:44,408 --> 00:34:46,247
There's still time.

612
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:51,285
Good night, Doctor.

613
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,124
Good night.

614
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,846
REUBEN
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.

615
00:35:22,981 --> 00:35:24,351
This is the <i>Mariposa.</i>
Mayday. Mayday.

616
00:35:24,486 --> 00:35:26,185
Last known position:
24...

617
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:41,766
I was awake.

618
00:35:41,966 --> 00:35:44,734
What's our distance to target?

619
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:47,355
43 kilometers.

620
00:35:48,407 --> 00:35:50,811
Just resting your eyes, huh?

621
00:35:50,946 --> 00:35:52,610
<i>Euh, ouais.</i>

622
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:55,154
I'm coming, I've just gotta pee.

623
00:35:55,179 --> 00:35:56,543
<i>Merci.</i>

624
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:58,053
No French before breakfast.

625
00:36:02,249 --> 00:36:03,619
REUBEN
Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.

626
00:36:03,755 --> 00:36:05,819
This is the <i>Mariposa.</i>
We are sinking.

627
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,696
Last known position:
24 degrees, 33 north

628
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:10,292
and 74, 56 west.

629
00:36:10,427 --> 00:36:11,627
<i>We are sinking.</i>

630
00:36:11,762 --> 00:36:13,431
The-the signal was
clear, right?

631
00:36:13,567 --> 00:36:15,028
I mean, you-you sure
you heard a mayday?

632
00:36:15,163 --> 00:36:16,497
-Positive.
- But did you get a location?

633
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,002
Down to ten square meters.

634
00:36:18,137 --> 00:36:20,004
They sent a DSC.

635
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:21,773
28 miles away.

636
00:36:21,909 --> 00:36:24,076
Well, that's...
that's 28 miles, you know,

637
00:36:24,212 --> 00:36:26,305
in the opposite direction.

638
00:36:26,441 --> 00:36:28,651
What? Bobby, what, do you want
to leave them? Come on.

639
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,075
Nah, of course not.

640
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,648
I'm saying this guy has
a working radio,

641
00:36:31,783 --> 00:36:34,316
and, you know,
he can transmit his location.

642
00:36:34,452 --> 00:36:36,985
It's true. It's not as if
they're gonna freeze to death.

643
00:36:37,121 --> 00:36:39,858
I mean, I'm saying, like,
help is gonna be on its way.

644
00:36:39,994 --> 00:36:41,730
There's probably a coast guard
ship on its way right now.

645
00:36:41,865 --> 00:36:42,990
Two miles!

646
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:48,633
Look, we are three minutes away
from this Mosasaur, which,

647
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:50,332
may I remind you,
is what we came here for.

648
00:36:50,468 --> 00:36:52,339
The Mosasaur is tagged.

649
00:36:52,474 --> 00:36:54,276
We found it once,
we'll find it again.

650
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:56,869
Maybe we can, but, Z,
we're talking about

651
00:36:57,004 --> 00:36:58,412
tens of millions
of dollars here.

652
00:36:58,547 --> 00:37:00,408
And all they need to do
is just float around

653
00:37:00,543 --> 00:37:02,251
for a couple of hours.

654
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,111
I've got visual!
13 degrees off the port side!

655
00:37:07,882 --> 00:37:09,016
That's it.

656
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:12,853
Okay, I have to agree
with Mr., um...

657
00:37:12,988 --> 00:37:14,523
-Atwater.
- ...Atwater.

658
00:37:14,658 --> 00:37:17,697
- The Mosasaur first.
- Right.

659
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:19,059
Right?

660
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,906
LeClerc, new course.

661
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:28,775
24, 33 north, 74, 56 west.

662
00:37:28,911 --> 00:37:30,042
Flank speed.

663
00:37:30,177 --> 00:37:31,639
LeCLERC:
Aye, aye.

664
00:37:31,775 --> 00:37:33,810
We're search and rescue now.

665
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,451
It's my charter.

666
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:40,146
It's my boat.

667
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:16,717
Oh, my God.

668
00:38:16,853 --> 00:38:18,391
Is that... is that...

669
00:38:18,526 --> 00:38:19,828
- Oh, my God. Hey.
-Oh, my God.

670
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:21,888
Hey! Hey!

671
00:38:22,024 --> 00:38:24,564
-Hey, over here!
- Over here!

672
00:38:30,467 --> 00:38:32,533
<i>I don't know. It was,
like, the size of the boat.</i>

673
00:38:32,668 --> 00:38:34,009
Bigger.

674
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,770
50 feet, 70. I-I don't know.

675
00:38:35,905 --> 00:38:37,037
It was a snakelike body

676
00:38:37,172 --> 00:38:38,707
with a large skull
and a long snout?

677
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:40,713
- Yes. Yes.
- And limbs like paddles?

678
00:38:40,848 --> 00:38:43,251
- Yes. Yes.
- A long tail region
with a downcurved end?

679
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:44,782
Look, man, that's what it is.

680
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:46,450
- What else it could be?
- What the hell you doing

681
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:47,849
this far out with a little kid?

682
00:38:47,984 --> 00:38:50,151
Uh, we're just making
a crossing.

683
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:52,918
Barbados to Cape Town.
We've-we've done it before.

684
00:38:53,053 --> 00:38:54,429
Shouldn't they be in school?

685
00:38:56,096 --> 00:38:57,465
They are.

686
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,699
It's summer break.
Wh-What is your problem?

687
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:00,800
My problem is
you should've known better.

688
00:39:00,935 --> 00:39:02,228
How?

689
00:39:02,363 --> 00:39:03,868
There are 50,000 boats
on this ocean right now.

690
00:39:04,003 --> 00:39:06,501
One was attacked by a Mosasaur.
Wh-What are the odds?

691
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:08,067
Duncan, let it go, okay?

692
00:39:08,203 --> 00:39:09,671
You know you're not
pissed off at him.

693
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:11,974
Okay? These kids are safe now.

694
00:39:12,109 --> 00:39:14,879
All right...
I don't understand.

695
00:39:15,014 --> 00:39:16,445
Why would a Mosasaur attack
a 45-foot sailboat?

696
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,144
It's not food.

697
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,389
Maybe it thought
the boat was a rival,

698
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,490
and it wanted to eliminate
any competition.

699
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,853
- How far off course are we?
- 28 miles.

700
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,555
And how long
to reacquire the target?

701
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,224
Uh, two hours, maybe.

702
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:32,729
Depends how fast it's moving
and in which direction.

703
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,235
Well, what say
we turn the boat around

704
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,505
and get the mission
back on track?

705
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,070
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
How fast what's moving?

706
00:39:38,205 --> 00:39:39,502
Wh-What mission?

707
00:39:39,638 --> 00:39:41,067
So...  About that.

708
00:39:41,202 --> 00:39:42,574
- It's, uh...
-Okay.

709
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,877
So, exactly what are you guys
doing here?

710
00:39:45,013 --> 00:39:48,149
Uh, we are gonna take a detour
and pick up a few items,

711
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:49,484
and that's it.

712
00:39:50,481 --> 00:39:52,250
What-what items?

713
00:39:52,385 --> 00:39:55,021
- It's okay, honey. It's okay.
- Wh-What is she talking about?

714
00:39:55,157 --> 00:39:56,392
Hey. That guy?

715
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,318
- Hi. Excuse me.
- Creeping me out.

716
00:39:59,453 --> 00:40:01,725
- What'd I do?
- You're creeping me out.

717
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,857
Can we get
the tracking map up, please?

718
00:40:04,993 --> 00:40:06,633
Uh, all right, look, look.

719
00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:09,428
Uh, we understand
you've got your own business,

720
00:40:09,563 --> 00:40:13,204
and... and, um,
we're very grateful to you.

721
00:40:13,339 --> 00:40:15,609
You pulled us out of the water.
We're not gonna forget that.

722
00:40:15,745 --> 00:40:17,679
- But can you
just drop us off and...
- Is that it?

723
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:20,180
-That would be great.
-Flip this up. <i>Pardon.</i>

724
00:40:20,316 --> 00:40:21,679
It's hard to tell.

725
00:40:21,815 --> 00:40:23,278
You can leave us
at any convenient port.

726
00:40:23,414 --> 00:40:25,115
Please.

727
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:26,453
Yeah?

728
00:40:26,588 --> 00:40:28,552
The software's ghosting.

729
00:40:28,688 --> 00:40:29,918
It's doubling the signal.

730
00:40:30,054 --> 00:40:31,216
Maybe it's just echoing
off our boat.

731
00:40:31,351 --> 00:40:32,791
- That's not an echo.
-What?

732
00:40:32,927 --> 00:40:33,953
- What is it you need to get?
- That's two signals.

733
00:40:36,694 --> 00:40:38,161
So we already found it?

734
00:40:38,297 --> 00:40:40,428
No, no.

735
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:41,837
It found us.

736
00:40:44,103 --> 00:40:45,735
- Oh, no, no. Come on, guys.
-Okay...

737
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,106
-Whoa.
-Whoa.

738
00:40:49,242 --> 00:40:51,205
-It's here.
-
Nina, tell me something.

739
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,578
Everything's online. It's fine.

740
00:40:52,714 --> 00:40:54,249
Okay, so we just
got away from it,

741
00:40:54,384 --> 00:40:55,416
and you guys have been
chasing it?

742
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,578
Uh, starboard. Yeah, yeah.

743
00:40:56,714 --> 00:40:58,046
Guys, listen.

744
00:40:58,182 --> 00:40:59,787
We're gonna be
a couple of minutes tops,

745
00:40:59,922 --> 00:41:01,652
then we're all going to this
island like she said, okay?

746
00:41:01,787 --> 00:41:03,085
There's a village complex there

747
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,955
with geothermal energy
that still works.

748
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,591
You can wait there.
You'll be totally safe.

749
00:41:06,726 --> 00:41:07,955
-What?
-Oh, my God.

750
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,858
There. Starboard.

751
00:41:09,994 --> 00:41:11,493
-Okay.
-Let's go!

752
00:41:11,628 --> 00:41:12,762
Take the wheel.

753
00:41:12,898 --> 00:41:13,865
- I'll get a bearing.
- Aye, aye.

754
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:26,807
Ah! It's beautiful!

755
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,950
-Yes!
- Whoo!

756
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:30,178
Let's go!

757
00:41:38,987 --> 00:41:40,562
We're losing her!

758
00:41:47,966 --> 00:41:50,096
Loomis! I need you to secure me

759
00:41:50,231 --> 00:41:51,969
- to the bow rail.
-Okay.

760
00:41:53,276 --> 00:41:54,510
Make it tight.

761
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:57,370
- Like this?
- Yeah.

762
00:41:58,776 --> 00:41:59,977
- The other side.
- Okay.

763
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:05,119
Remember, don't fire
until it's within ten meters.

764
00:42:05,254 --> 00:42:06,478
Got it.

765
00:42:13,029 --> 00:42:14,186
All right.

766
00:42:14,321 --> 00:42:15,597
Nina, I need command
up here now.

767
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:19,832
Comm is yours.

768
00:42:30,543 --> 00:42:32,345
Come on. Come on!

769
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:34,743
We got to be closer! Move it!

770
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,747
Hey. Get up here and spot.

771
00:42:36,883 --> 00:42:38,246
NINA
On my way.

772
00:42:40,089 --> 00:42:41,557
20 meters.

773
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,628
Almost in range!

774
00:42:52,365 --> 00:42:53,868
15 meters.

775
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:55,098
Copy.

776
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:05,075
Ah.

777
00:43:15,954 --> 00:43:17,782
Another dart.

778
00:43:17,918 --> 00:43:19,122
Okay.

779
00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:22,829
Come on!

780
00:43:32,103 --> 00:43:35,567
It's coming at us! Turn! Turn!

781
00:43:37,105 --> 00:43:39,408
Quick! It's in range!

782
00:43:39,544 --> 00:43:40,814
Come on!

783
00:43:48,652 --> 00:43:50,450
There, go!

784
00:43:59,202 --> 00:44:00,135
Hey!

785
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:02,069
Help me up! Help me!

786
00:44:08,234 --> 00:44:09,678
Come on!

787
00:44:14,449 --> 00:44:16,179
Take the shot!

788
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,999
It worked!

789
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:42,334
Yes! Come down ten knots!

790
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:44,636
Hard starboard.
Down ten. Down ten.

791
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:49,713
There it is!

792
00:44:49,849 --> 00:44:51,811
Port side off the stern rail.

793
00:44:55,186 --> 00:44:57,649
I got it! I got it!

794
00:45:07,835 --> 00:45:09,532
Nice shot.

795
00:45:09,668 --> 00:45:10,904
Nice rocket.

796
00:45:12,003 --> 00:45:13,540
- That was fantastic.
- Yeah!

797
00:45:13,676 --> 00:45:15,442
That was genius.

798
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:19,847
- Yes.
- That was good.

799
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,073
That worked. That worked.

800
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:22,548
Oh, God.

801
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:38,432
-Hey.
-Hey.

802
00:45:38,567 --> 00:45:40,401
What if we don't?

803
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:41,559
What if we don't what?

804
00:45:41,695 --> 00:45:43,200
Well, what if
we get the samples

805
00:45:43,336 --> 00:45:44,937
and we don't give them over
to a company

806
00:45:45,073 --> 00:45:46,938
that makes a lifesaving drug
and then prices it

807
00:45:47,074 --> 00:45:49,536
so 99% of the planet
can't afford it?

808
00:45:51,112 --> 00:45:53,744
Science is for all of us,
not some of us.

809
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,311
Have you thought about that?

810
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:58,545
No, I guess I haven't.

811
00:45:59,581 --> 00:46:01,614
Well, then maybe
you should start.

812
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:04,354
- Maybe you should stop.
-Dad, please.

813
00:46:04,489 --> 00:46:06,793
Hey, Xavier.

814
00:46:06,928 --> 00:46:08,596
Head between your legs,
deep breaths.

815
00:46:08,731 --> 00:46:10,730
Hey. Deep breaths.
Deep breaths.

816
00:46:10,865 --> 00:46:13,292
Dad, I think I'm gonna be sick.

817
00:46:13,428 --> 00:46:14,864
It's all right. Just breathe.

818
00:46:24,606 --> 00:46:26,275
Those things from the boat.

819
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:29,081
They're...
they're-they're back.

820
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:38,326
- Oh, my God.
-Dad?

821
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,059
What the hell are those?

822
00:46:41,226 --> 00:46:43,623
Sit down, honey. Stay close.

823
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,297
Spinosaurus.

824
00:46:54,468 --> 00:46:56,641
It's mutualism!

825
00:46:58,515 --> 00:47:00,772
Interspecies symbiosis!

826
00:47:01,814 --> 00:47:03,583
Those Spinosaurus,

827
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:05,782
they help the Mosasaur hunt.

828
00:47:05,917 --> 00:47:07,152
They help it kill!

829
00:47:08,949 --> 00:47:10,984
Well, that's discouraging.

830
00:47:13,993 --> 00:47:16,458
These are our waters now.

831
00:47:21,828 --> 00:47:23,872
Over here! There's another one!

832
00:47:25,668 --> 00:47:28,341
There! Seven o'clock!
Hurry! Quick!

833
00:47:33,681 --> 00:47:35,550
Bobby. Bobby, Bobby.

834
00:47:35,685 --> 00:47:37,318
Look out!

835
00:47:49,796 --> 00:47:52,227
Bobby! Bobby, no!

836
00:48:16,316 --> 00:48:18,657
Dad!

837
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:20,723
- Dad!
- Bella!

838
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:26,462
Dad!

839
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:34,272
Oh, my God. Oh.

840
00:48:46,753 --> 00:48:49,857
What are you doing?
You're heading into the rocks!

841
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:51,552
I can outrun those things.

842
00:48:51,688 --> 00:48:54,218
The Mosasaur can't go
into shallow water.

843
00:48:57,031 --> 00:48:58,934
Everybody,
hold on to something!

844
00:49:01,301 --> 00:49:04,335
I can't move my leg, honey.

845
00:49:06,033 --> 00:49:08,240
If we hit those rocks,
we're gonna wreck.

846
00:49:09,373 --> 00:49:11,137
Tie these
to everything you need.

847
00:49:11,273 --> 00:49:12,772
Be ready to jump.

848
00:49:19,588 --> 00:49:20,681
It's fast.

849
00:49:21,718 --> 00:49:23,750
LeClerc,
the engine's overheating.

850
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:31,361
Teresa, get back inside.
Get on the radio.

851
00:49:31,496 --> 00:49:33,594
Mayday three times
and send coordinates. Go!

852
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:35,163
Three times, send coordinates.
Got it.

853
00:49:35,299 --> 00:49:37,302
Hang on, honey.

854
00:49:38,635 --> 00:49:40,170
Isabella.
Isabella, hey, look at me.

855
00:49:40,305 --> 00:49:41,309
It's gonna be okay. Listen.

856
00:49:43,075 --> 00:49:44,442
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

857
00:49:44,577 --> 00:49:46,111
- Okay. Hang on. Hey, hey, hey.
- Is anybody there?

858
00:49:46,247 --> 00:49:47,240
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop.

859
00:49:47,376 --> 00:49:48,616
- Please! Hey!
- Stop.

860
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,442
Just stop. Stop for a second.

861
00:49:50,577 --> 00:49:51,911
What do you mean, "stop"?

862
00:49:52,046 --> 00:49:53,115
W-We got
to handle this ourselves.

863
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:54,383
- What?
- This is the...

864
00:49:54,518 --> 00:49:56,322
- This is the protocol.
- Are you crazy?

865
00:49:56,457 --> 00:49:57,892
- No! Mayday. No. No, no, no.
- Just give me the... Hey.

866
00:49:58,027 --> 00:49:59,626
- No. Whoa. Hey.
- Hey, Mayday! Mayday!

867
00:49:59,761 --> 00:50:01,227
Back off!

868
00:50:07,265 --> 00:50:09,031
Please help me.

869
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:11,701
Please. Help me, please.

870
00:50:11,837 --> 00:50:13,639
Please.

871
00:50:13,774 --> 00:50:15,103
Please help me.

872
00:50:15,238 --> 00:50:17,377
Grab my hand, please.

873
00:50:17,512 --> 00:50:19,205
Dad!

874
00:50:22,618 --> 00:50:24,318
Sweetie! Teresa!

875
00:50:24,453 --> 00:50:25,979
No!

876
00:50:26,115 --> 00:50:27,321
Teresa!

877
00:50:29,617 --> 00:50:31,092
Teresa!

878
00:50:34,357 --> 00:50:36,190
Teresa! No!

879
00:50:38,294 --> 00:50:40,662
Man overboard!

880
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,496
Listen to me.
We're going in the water now.

881
00:50:43,631 --> 00:50:45,169
Yes. The boat's gonna crash.

882
00:50:45,305 --> 00:50:46,569
We have to.
Your sister's there.

883
00:50:46,704 --> 00:50:47,972
You understand? Hey. Hey.

884
00:50:48,107 --> 00:50:50,238
Hey. I'm here. Okay?

885
00:50:50,374 --> 00:50:51,737
All right? I've got you.

886
00:50:51,873 --> 00:50:52,745
- You're all right.
- Daddy.

887
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,409
Come on. Come on!

888
00:50:54,544 --> 00:50:56,609
Get ready.
On the count of three.

889
00:50:56,744 --> 00:50:59,611
- One, two, three!
- Hey!

890
00:50:59,746 --> 00:51:01,914
Hey! We need to stick together!

891
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,220
Keep going!

892
00:51:31,544 --> 00:51:32,486
Whoa! Get down!

893
00:51:55,608 --> 00:51:57,776
Zora! It can't go
in the shallows!

894
00:51:57,911 --> 00:52:00,577
Jump! Go! Jump!

895
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:15,086
Told you!

896
00:52:52,465 --> 00:52:54,602
I thought I lost you.
Are you okay?

897
00:52:54,737 --> 00:52:55,793
He let me fall.

898
00:52:55,928 --> 00:52:56,968
- Who?
- The guy on the boat.

899
00:52:57,103 --> 00:52:58,035
He tried to kill me.

900
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:59,807
I knew he was creepy!

901
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,473
Teresa? Teresa?

902
00:53:03,678 --> 00:53:05,312
Dad!

903
00:53:11,352 --> 00:53:13,484
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Yeah?

904
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:15,221
I got you. Oh, thank God.

905
00:53:15,357 --> 00:53:16,815
- You all right? Are you good?
- You okay?

906
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:18,391
Let's get out of the water.

907
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:42,750
Keep moving!

908
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,517
They're amphibious!

909
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,232
LeClerc, you okay?

910
00:53:57,778 --> 00:53:59,864
Next time, I'm driving.

911
00:54:01,467 --> 00:54:03,700
Move! Keep going!

912
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:16,715
We made it.

913
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,444
-I've got it here.
- Do we still have the case?

914
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:21,421
You got that side?

915
00:54:21,556 --> 00:54:23,051
-
We're getting there. Pull.
- Yeah.

916
00:54:23,187 --> 00:54:25,423
Yeah.
Come on. Grab it.

917
00:54:25,558 --> 00:54:27,628
Keep going. Yeah.
Go on. Grab it.

918
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,561
Keep moving.

919
00:54:29,696 --> 00:54:31,556
It's all right.
Just keep going to the beach.

920
00:54:45,946 --> 00:54:47,238
Nina!

921
00:54:50,347 --> 00:54:52,287
Nina! Nina!

922
00:54:54,251 --> 00:54:55,488
Nina!

923
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:58,084
Nina!

924
00:54:59,091 --> 00:54:59,989
Nina!

925
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:01,593
Kincaid!

926
00:55:04,525 --> 00:55:05,861
Nina!

927
00:55:31,251 --> 00:55:33,255
Hey. Hey.

928
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:35,522
I know. I know.

929
00:55:35,657 --> 00:55:37,363
It's okay, honey.

930
00:55:37,498 --> 00:55:39,132
They said
there's a village here.

931
00:55:39,267 --> 00:55:41,367
We'll find it and get help.

932
00:55:41,503 --> 00:55:44,129
All right?
You don't feel like talking?

933
00:55:44,264 --> 00:55:46,169
It's okay, honey.
You don't have to.

934
00:55:48,043 --> 00:55:49,509
You'll be okay.

935
00:55:51,773 --> 00:55:53,175
She'll be okay, right?

936
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,306
Uh, yeah.

937
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,054
Oh, wow.

938
00:56:17,038 --> 00:56:18,898
So, like...

939
00:56:19,033 --> 00:56:21,332
when an old person
buys a bed...

940
00:56:22,807 --> 00:56:24,869
...do you think,
before they buy it,

941
00:56:25,005 --> 00:56:27,041
they look at it and they go,

942
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:30,413
"Oh, wow, man, this is...
this is my deathbed"?

943
00:56:33,618 --> 00:56:35,346
Because I'm thinking that...

944
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:38,459
...right now.

945
00:56:40,425 --> 00:56:41,726
I think we got it.

946
00:56:42,729 --> 00:56:45,862
Come on.
Let's go find this village.

947
00:56:49,196 --> 00:56:50,901
Hurry up.

948
00:56:51,036 --> 00:56:52,807
We can't stay here.
They'll come back.

949
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:54,740
- They're more like mutations.
- What do you mean, "mutations"?

950
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:57,201
- Abnormalities, deviations.
- I know what the word means.

951
00:56:57,336 --> 00:56:59,070
What does it mean here,
where we are?

952
00:56:59,206 --> 00:57:00,947
What are you talking about?

953
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:02,579
This island that we're on,
Mr. Roarke here didn't tell us

954
00:57:02,714 --> 00:57:04,008
everything
that we need to know.

955
00:57:04,144 --> 00:57:05,718
Look, dinosaurs are dinosaurs.

956
00:57:05,853 --> 00:57:07,213
- What difference does it make?
- Okay, okay. Fine.

957
00:57:07,348 --> 00:57:08,716
Don't tell us.
We could just leave you here.

958
00:57:08,852 --> 00:57:10,214
- It's fine.
- Fine.

959
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:12,755
So, this island was
a laboratory of sorts.

960
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:15,630
They conducted
experimental work here.

961
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:18,662
- What kind of experiments?
- Crossbreeding of species.

962
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:21,167
The theme park owners
were just responding

963
00:57:21,303 --> 00:57:22,833
to what the audience wanted.

964
00:57:22,968 --> 00:57:24,471
They were tired of looking at
the same old thing.

965
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,799
"Engineered entertainments,"
they called them.

966
00:57:25,934 --> 00:57:28,771
Genetically altered freaks?

967
00:57:28,906 --> 00:57:30,135
Yeah. And you don't want
to do that

968
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:31,777
in the middle of
a theme park, do you?

969
00:57:31,912 --> 00:57:33,908
Ideally, you don't try
weird genetic shit at all.

970
00:57:34,043 --> 00:57:35,873
Well, they learned that
the hard way.

971
00:57:36,009 --> 00:57:37,551
Any that were malformed

972
00:57:37,686 --> 00:57:40,383
or just too damn hard
for anybody to look at,

973
00:57:40,518 --> 00:57:42,452
they left them here.

974
00:57:44,723 --> 00:57:45,917
Well, that's inhuman.

975
00:57:46,053 --> 00:57:47,925
Why not just euthanize them?

976
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:51,625
The average cost of a
created species is $72 million.

977
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,960
What would you do?

978
00:57:53,096 --> 00:57:54,302
Kill it
and have to tell your bank

979
00:57:54,437 --> 00:57:55,765
or just carry it forward
under R and D?

980
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,171
What would I do
with mutant dinosaurs

981
00:57:57,306 --> 00:57:58,897
from an accounting perspective?

982
00:57:59,033 --> 00:58:00,238
Is that really the question?

983
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:04,575
Can we please just
hurry this along?

984
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:06,408
Everybody, please stay cool.

985
00:58:06,543 --> 00:58:09,011
- Our situation hasn't changed.
- Two of our friends just died.

986
00:58:09,146 --> 00:58:11,251
Clearly, the situation's
changed quite a bit.

987
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:12,650
Yes, and that's horrible.

988
00:58:12,786 --> 00:58:14,380
But this is where
we are now, desperate,

989
00:58:14,515 --> 00:58:16,213
and that's not
any different than before.

990
00:58:16,349 --> 00:58:17,689
We were all desperate
to begin with.

991
00:58:17,825 --> 00:58:19,521
Otherwise, we wouldn't
have come. Right?

992
00:58:19,656 --> 00:58:21,724
You,
you specialize in a subject
nobody cares about anymore.

993
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,363
You're about to be
out of a job.

994
00:58:23,498 --> 00:58:25,032
You need this.
I want the money.

995
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,191
You want the money.

996
00:58:26,327 --> 00:58:27,661
Your company wants
all the money.

997
00:58:27,797 --> 00:58:29,296
We still have that case.

998
00:58:29,431 --> 00:58:30,766
First sample's in it.
Let's get the other two.

999
00:58:30,901 --> 00:58:32,701
That's a great idea.

1000
00:58:32,837 --> 00:58:35,167
We have no weapons, Z.

1001
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,041
We never did.
I mean, not really.

1002
00:58:37,176 --> 00:58:39,378
We had a... a few toys that
would have made us feel better.

1003
00:58:39,514 --> 00:58:41,173
They could have worked or not.

1004
00:58:41,308 --> 00:58:42,515
We are where
we're supposed to be.

1005
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:43,980
We know what
we're supposed to do.

1006
00:58:44,116 --> 00:58:45,553
Let's just get what we need
and get out.

1007
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,045
Those kids, the people
who went into the ocean,

1008
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,523
they could still be alive.

1009
00:58:49,658 --> 00:58:50,815
I say we find them first
and then we get out.

1010
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:52,393
Uh, get out how?

1011
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,318
Does anyone want to hear
the backup plan?

1012
00:58:54,454 --> 00:58:55,992
She has a backup plan?

1013
00:58:56,128 --> 00:58:58,599
She doesn't get out of bed
without a backup plan.

1014
00:59:02,129 --> 00:59:03,835
I hired an exfil team

1015
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:06,165
to monitor
our boat's radio frequency.

1016
00:59:06,301 --> 00:59:08,700
So if we go silent
for 24 hours,

1017
00:59:08,835 --> 00:59:12,476
they'll do a flyby at exactly
sunset on the second night.

1018
00:59:12,611 --> 00:59:13,809
But that's tomorrow.

1019
00:59:13,945 --> 00:59:15,779
Your plans showed
a village complex

1020
00:59:15,914 --> 00:59:17,374
on the southwest ridge
with a helipad.

1021
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:19,082
They'll hover
for exactly two minutes.

1022
00:59:19,218 --> 00:59:21,283
If no one shows, they'll leave.
But if they see us...

1023
00:59:21,418 --> 00:59:23,852
Why only two minutes?
Why don't they just land?

1024
00:59:23,988 --> 00:59:25,257
'Cause pilots want to
live, too.

1025
00:59:25,392 --> 00:59:27,057
Oh, great.

1026
00:59:27,192 --> 00:59:29,756
Got to find high ground
before the sun goes down.

1027
00:59:36,667 --> 00:59:38,034
We have to go now.

1028
00:59:38,169 --> 00:59:40,333
Drop anything
you can't carry all day.

1029
00:59:42,582 --> 00:59:43,749
What do we do now?

1030
00:59:43,806 --> 00:59:45,638
Just try not to die.

1031
01:00:06,761 --> 01:00:08,126
Warm.

1032
01:00:08,262 --> 01:00:10,099
There's geothermal power.

1033
01:00:11,334 --> 01:00:13,399
Must come through these pipes
from hot springs.

1034
01:00:15,543 --> 01:00:17,671
It must lead to the village.

1035
01:00:19,106 --> 01:00:21,181
Maybe there's a radio?

1036
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:23,146
Great.  Yeah.

1037
01:00:23,281 --> 01:00:25,483
We use that to get the guy
who tried to kill me.

1038
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:27,778
Or, you know, to get rescued?

1039
01:00:27,914 --> 01:00:29,149
Yeah.

1040
01:00:29,284 --> 01:00:31,188
Then we'll get
the son of a bitch.

1041
01:00:31,324 --> 01:00:32,583
Right.

1042
01:00:32,718 --> 01:00:34,792
Okay, we follow the pipes
to the village.

1043
01:00:34,928 --> 01:00:37,060
Unless somebody's got
another idea.

1044
01:00:38,192 --> 01:00:39,634
I have some weed.

1045
01:00:42,228 --> 01:00:43,770
Might be a little damp,

1046
01:00:43,905 --> 01:00:46,440
but, uh, I feel like
we could just chill here, no?

1047
01:00:46,575 --> 01:00:48,599
You don't smoke-- Do you smoke?

1048
01:00:50,771 --> 01:00:52,009
No?

1049
01:00:56,811 --> 01:00:58,218
Okay.

1050
01:00:58,353 --> 01:00:59,948
Dad, he's, uh...

1051
01:01:00,084 --> 01:01:01,722
he's clearly messing with you.

1052
01:01:03,718 --> 01:01:05,355
Ah.

1053
01:01:07,629 --> 01:01:09,259
Yo, help me up?

1054
01:01:09,395 --> 01:01:10,830
Funny.

1055
01:01:12,066 --> 01:01:14,497
All right.
No one help me up. That's fine.

1056
01:01:32,648 --> 01:01:35,355
Maybe that family will
know to head for the village.

1057
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:36,785
God, I hope so.

1058
01:01:41,258 --> 01:01:42,895
How far to the next sample?

1059
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:44,523
Well, according
to the satellite imagery,

1060
01:01:44,659 --> 01:01:47,994
the Titanosaur herd stays
in the central valley.

1061
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:50,166
We should reach them by dawn.

1062
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:55,366
Be careful where you step.

1063
01:01:55,501 --> 01:01:57,536
Something just moved
past my leg.

1064
01:01:59,646 --> 01:02:00,846
Hey, you want to tell me

1065
01:02:00,982 --> 01:02:02,880
how the, uh, girl
fell over the rail?

1066
01:02:03,016 --> 01:02:04,511
The thing hit the boat.
You were there.

1067
01:02:04,646 --> 01:02:07,752
Oh. Uh, so were you,
on the bridge, next to her.

1068
01:02:07,887 --> 01:02:10,180
So there was nothing
you could do?

1069
01:02:10,315 --> 01:02:12,353
What are you implying?

1070
01:02:15,327 --> 01:02:17,191
This isn't
your first expedition, huh?

1071
01:02:17,327 --> 01:02:19,833
No, I've been on digs
since I was 12.

1072
01:02:19,968 --> 01:02:22,893
I studied under Alan Grant
as a postdoc.

1073
01:02:23,029 --> 01:02:25,800
I suppose you're in this kind
of situation all the time?

1074
01:02:25,935 --> 01:02:27,773
Used to be.

1075
01:02:27,909 --> 01:02:30,407
I hate the jungle.
I try to avoid it now.

1076
01:02:30,543 --> 01:02:31,944
Why is that?

1077
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:33,440
Mm, you can't see
three feet in front of you,

1078
01:02:33,575 --> 01:02:35,541
and you always know
you're being stalked.

1079
01:02:35,676 --> 01:02:38,412
And the only place to hide
is underwater.

1080
01:02:40,216 --> 01:02:42,218
I refuse to die in the jungle.

1081
01:02:43,483 --> 01:02:45,185
My dream is
I die in a shallow sea

1082
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,355
and I'm buried quickly by silt.

1083
01:02:48,727 --> 01:02:50,260
That's beautiful.

1084
01:02:50,395 --> 01:02:52,494
It's the best chance
of being fossilized that way.

1085
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:56,166
You're a weirdo.

1086
01:02:57,129 --> 01:02:58,597
Thank you.

1087
01:03:01,434 --> 01:03:02,900
You got to drop this.

1088
01:03:03,035 --> 01:03:05,907
She screamed, I turned around,
and then she was gone.

1089
01:03:06,042 --> 01:03:07,607
Okay. All right.

1090
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:09,243
If I find out otherwise,
though, we'll leave you here

1091
01:03:09,379 --> 01:03:11,112
and you can rejoin
the food chain.

1092
01:03:11,248 --> 01:03:13,415
I'm too smart to die.

1093
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:15,080
You know, intelligence is
massively overrated

1094
01:03:15,215 --> 01:03:16,214
as an adaptive trait.

1095
01:03:16,349 --> 01:03:17,950
- Oh, yeah?
- Seriously.

1096
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:19,053
Enlighten us.

1097
01:03:19,189 --> 01:03:21,652
pretty dumb, right?

1098
01:03:21,787 --> 01:03:24,655
And yet they survived
for 167 million years.

1099
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:28,526
And we Homo sapiens,
geniuses by comparison,

1100
01:03:28,661 --> 01:03:32,101
only have about
200,000 years so far.

1101
01:03:32,237 --> 01:03:33,769
But with
our huge cranial cavities,

1102
01:03:33,904 --> 01:03:35,667
we're so smart,

1103
01:03:35,803 --> 01:03:38,813
we already have the capacity
to annihilate ourselves.

1104
01:03:40,575 --> 01:03:42,645
I doubt we make it
to even one million.

1105
01:03:42,781 --> 01:03:43,846
Hold on.

1106
01:03:43,982 --> 01:03:45,345
Don't we rule the Earth?

1107
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,113
We got to be doing
something right.

1108
01:03:47,249 --> 01:03:48,421
We don't rule the Earth.

1109
01:03:48,556 --> 01:03:50,814
We just think we do.

1110
01:03:51,917 --> 01:03:53,752
I mean, sure,
we're changing the environment,

1111
01:03:53,888 --> 01:03:56,820
but that makes us the ones to
worry about, not the planet.

1112
01:03:56,956 --> 01:03:59,359
When the Earth gets tired
of us, believe me,

1113
01:03:59,495 --> 01:04:03,068
it will shake us off
like a summer cold.

1114
01:04:06,107 --> 01:04:08,542
Of all species
that have existed on Earth,

1115
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:11,703
99.9% of them are now extinct.

1116
01:04:14,616 --> 01:04:16,974
Survival is a long shot.

1117
01:04:21,356 --> 01:04:22,351
Whoa.

1118
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:27,659
You hear that?

1119
01:04:27,795 --> 01:04:29,490
Every day could be your last.

1120
01:04:37,201 --> 01:04:40,102
All right, everyone,
find a stick.

1121
01:04:40,238 --> 01:04:42,173
You'll need it
to clear your way.

1122
01:04:57,392 --> 01:04:59,249
Bella?

1123
01:04:59,384 --> 01:05:00,624
It's okay.

1124
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,589
It's little.

1125
01:05:03,591 --> 01:05:05,123
And see?
And it's a plant-eater.

1126
01:05:05,258 --> 01:05:06,299
It's okay.

1127
01:05:06,435 --> 01:05:08,361
No. No. Go.

1128
01:05:08,496 --> 01:05:11,037
Go. Shoo.

1129
01:05:14,037 --> 01:05:15,439
Hey, Xavier.

1130
01:05:15,575 --> 01:05:16,773
Yeah.

1131
01:05:16,909 --> 01:05:18,676
You jumped in after her.

1132
01:05:18,811 --> 01:05:20,105
Yeah.

1133
01:05:20,241 --> 01:05:21,776
Respect for that.

1134
01:05:23,376 --> 01:05:25,051
Whatever, <i>guapo.</i>

1135
01:05:31,351 --> 01:05:32,592
Hard to like, honey.

1136
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:34,885
Yeah. Took me a minute, too.

1137
01:05:36,862 --> 01:05:38,295
Let's do this.

1138
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:52,306
Let's do this...

1139
01:05:52,441 --> 01:05:54,113
but, like,
going that way, though.

1140
01:06:01,881 --> 01:06:03,617
What are the last two species?

1141
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:05,986
Uh, Titanosaur
and Quetzalcoatlus,

1142
01:06:06,122 --> 01:06:07,855
an 11-ton sauropod

1143
01:06:07,991 --> 01:06:10,526
and a pterosaur the size of a
school bus with 30-foot wings.

1144
01:06:10,662 --> 01:06:12,696
One of those little
buses like for field trips

1145
01:06:12,832 --> 01:06:13,831
or the full thing?

1146
01:06:13,966 --> 01:06:15,458
Does it matter?

1147
01:06:15,594 --> 01:06:17,235
Just asking.

1148
01:07:34,242 --> 01:07:35,907
It's okay.

1149
01:07:37,649 --> 01:07:40,081
You get some more sleep
while I take it for a while.

1150
01:07:40,216 --> 01:07:41,781
Oh, no. I'm okay.

1151
01:07:41,916 --> 01:07:44,388
I know you're okay,
but it's my watch.

1152
01:07:46,594 --> 01:07:47,624
You sure?

1153
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,254
Yeah.

1154
01:07:49,389 --> 01:07:51,692
Thanks.

1155
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:55,927
Uh, the pipes, they just go
right up that way.

1156
01:07:56,062 --> 01:07:58,336
Hopefully towards the village.
All right?

1157
01:08:05,178 --> 01:08:07,873
You know,
I was wrong about you.

1158
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:11,481
No, you were right.
I'm lazy as hell.

1159
01:08:13,782 --> 01:08:16,046
She might be alive
because of what you did.

1160
01:08:22,521 --> 01:08:26,397
I don't even kn-know why she
wants to be with me.

1161
01:08:27,926 --> 01:08:30,731
Well, she... she sees
who you are.

1162
01:08:32,699 --> 01:08:34,537
Thank God she doesn't.

1163
01:08:36,578 --> 01:08:38,969
Hey. Hey!

1164
01:08:39,104 --> 01:08:41,609
Other people may talk shit
about us,

1165
01:08:41,745 --> 01:08:44,151
but we don't have to do
the job for them.

1166
01:08:45,217 --> 01:08:47,187
Otherwise, it becomes true.

1167
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:56,922
Well, I got to take a piss.

1168
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:00,988
Come on.

1169
01:10:01,124 --> 01:10:03,025
Come.

1170
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,864
It's okay.

1171
01:10:04,999 --> 01:10:06,523
Come on.

1172
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:55,706
-How much further?
-Not far.

1173
01:11:55,841 --> 01:11:58,378
The Titanosaur herd should be
right across this valley.

1174
01:11:58,513 --> 01:12:00,208
But they're herbivores, right?

1175
01:12:00,344 --> 01:12:01,376
Yeah.

1176
01:12:01,512 --> 01:12:02,943
That's good.

1177
01:12:03,078 --> 01:12:05,016
But the things
that hunt them aren't.

1178
01:12:05,151 --> 01:12:06,115
Oh, great.

1179
01:12:07,783 --> 01:12:09,483
KINCAID
Quiet.

1180
01:13:10,983 --> 01:13:12,452
Hmm.

1181
01:13:13,813 --> 01:13:15,722
You want one? Mm.

1182
01:13:30,802 --> 01:13:32,938
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1183
01:13:33,073 --> 01:13:35,341
Oh.

1184
01:13:45,647 --> 01:13:47,311
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1185
01:14:13,209 --> 01:14:15,306
You're a secret
adrenaline junkie, Henry.

1186
01:14:18,511 --> 01:14:20,580
This is our chance.
They're distracted.

1187
01:14:20,716 --> 01:14:21,878
Distracted by what?

1188
01:14:26,126 --> 01:14:28,256
Oh.

1189
01:14:30,892 --> 01:14:32,664
-Oh, my God.
- Okay.

1190
01:14:54,917 --> 01:14:57,119
You don't see that every day.

1191
01:14:57,255 --> 01:14:58,855
Or ever.

1192
01:16:32,911 --> 01:16:34,344
Whoo!

1193
01:17:35,413 --> 01:17:36,848
One to go.

1194
01:17:39,114 --> 01:17:41,017
Looks like we're climbing.

1195
01:17:41,152 --> 01:17:43,184
Hope you're good
with heights, Doc.

1196
01:17:52,129 --> 01:17:53,432
The guys on the boat said

1197
01:17:53,567 --> 01:17:54,964
there was power at the village.

1198
01:17:55,099 --> 01:17:56,636
We just have to trust
that they were right.

1199
01:17:56,772 --> 01:17:58,027
Hey, how much further
you think it is?

1200
01:17:58,163 --> 01:18:00,135
A mile, maybe two.

1201
01:18:03,476 --> 01:18:04,743
Is your leg okay?

1202
01:18:04,878 --> 01:18:06,904
Yeah, it just hurts a little.
I'm fine.

1203
01:18:07,039 --> 01:18:08,346
It's okay.

1204
01:18:10,483 --> 01:18:12,417
And, uh...

1205
01:18:12,552 --> 01:18:16,690
are we okay with... that?

1206
01:18:20,988 --> 01:18:22,586
It's helping her.

1207
01:18:23,632 --> 01:18:25,655
It's okay. I got an eye on it.

1208
01:18:33,171 --> 01:18:34,637
Mom's never gonna trust you
with us again.

1209
01:18:34,773 --> 01:18:36,167
Oh, God, no.

1210
01:18:36,302 --> 01:18:38,173
Hey, guys.

1211
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:40,743
I'm naming her Dolores.

1212
01:18:40,879 --> 01:18:43,216
Iz, you're alive?

1213
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:44,813
You talk?

1214
01:18:44,948 --> 01:18:47,554
I'm taking her home with me.

1215
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:49,813
That may or may not be
a terrible idea.

1216
01:18:49,949 --> 01:18:51,384
Dolores?

1217
01:18:52,888 --> 01:18:53,986
Hey, you good?

1218
01:18:54,121 --> 01:18:55,651
Yeah, it's, uh...

1219
01:18:55,787 --> 01:18:57,490
it's just kind of nice,
you and your dad.

1220
01:18:57,625 --> 01:18:59,124
I don't know.
Maybe this whole thing will...

1221
01:18:59,259 --> 01:19:01,062
Xavier!

1222
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:02,801
Bella, Bella! Bella, wait!

1223
01:19:31,091 --> 01:19:32,689
What's the smell?

1224
01:19:37,233 --> 01:19:39,267
What's wrong with her?

1225
01:19:45,776 --> 01:19:47,279
What is she scared of?

1226
01:19:50,342 --> 01:19:51,543
Help me up.

1227
01:19:59,092 --> 01:20:01,788
Uh, we'll follow the river.
That way.

1228
01:20:01,923 --> 01:20:03,797
I see a boat.

1229
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:06,424
You can't walk.

1230
01:20:06,559 --> 01:20:09,025
Xavier can help you
while I go get it.

1231
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:10,136
All right.

1232
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:11,695
Be careful.

1233
01:20:17,678 --> 01:20:19,703
Can I get some more licorice?

1234
01:20:39,065 --> 01:20:41,197
Oh, my God.

1235
01:21:04,353 --> 01:21:07,390
REUBEN
Teresa. Teresa!

1236
01:21:07,526 --> 01:21:08,525
Hurry.

1237
01:21:08,661 --> 01:21:10,721
Just go. Come on.

1238
01:22:13,190 --> 01:22:14,620
Come on. Come on.

1239
01:22:14,756 --> 01:22:16,725
-  Don't wake it up.
- Come on. Come on.

1240
01:22:20,593 --> 01:22:21,796
Move! Come back.

1241
01:22:26,869 --> 01:22:28,106
Okay.

1242
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,413
No.

1243
01:22:36,549 --> 01:22:38,048
Shit.

1244
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:52,823
ISABELLA
Dolores.

1245
01:22:54,628 --> 01:22:56,662
You have to go. It's not safe.

1246
01:23:09,278 --> 01:23:11,350
Please. Go, go, go, go, go.

1247
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:12,777
Shoo, shoo.

1248
01:23:20,155 --> 01:23:21,357
Come on. Come on.

1249
01:23:32,697 --> 01:23:35,371
- Don't. Don't. Don't.
- No, don't. Don't. Don't.

1250
01:23:47,420 --> 01:23:49,016
-
Come on, honey. Come on.
-Teresa.

1251
01:23:49,151 --> 01:23:51,287
Come on.

1252
01:23:51,422 --> 01:23:53,785
Come on, baby. Come on.

1253
01:24:08,104 --> 01:24:09,735
Come on. Come on.

1254
01:24:14,581 --> 01:24:16,516
Okay.

1255
01:24:20,983 --> 01:24:22,280
Bella.

1256
01:24:22,416 --> 01:24:24,222
Come on, honey. Come on.

1257
01:24:30,863 --> 01:24:33,264
Help her. Help her.

1258
01:24:33,399 --> 01:24:34,931
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

1259
01:24:35,067 --> 01:24:36,762
Grab the paddle. Quietly.

1260
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,937
Go! Go! Go!

1261
01:24:42,072 --> 01:24:43,203
- Paddle!
- Come on!

1262
01:24:43,339 --> 01:24:45,874
- Paddle. Come on.
- Paddle!

1263
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:50,707
Dad, it's...

1264
01:24:50,843 --> 01:24:54,087
Paddle! Paddle! Paddle!

1265
01:24:55,347 --> 01:24:56,555
Paddle!

1266
01:24:56,690 --> 01:24:58,282
- Go, go!
- Go!

1267
01:24:58,417 --> 01:24:59,918
- Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on!
- Paddle!

1268
01:25:00,053 --> 01:25:02,255
- Hurry! Paddle!
- Come on, come on! Go, go, go!

1269
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:04,794
Dig, dig!

1270
01:25:04,930 --> 01:25:07,133
Dig! Dig! Come on!

1271
01:25:09,899 --> 01:25:11,896
Come on,
come on, come on!

1272
01:25:15,372 --> 01:25:16,837
As hard as you can! Dig!

1273
01:25:16,972 --> 01:25:18,738
Dig!

1274
01:25:27,252 --> 01:25:28,785
- Come on! Paddle!
-Go!

1275
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:30,816
Paddle! Paddle!

1276
01:25:46,698 --> 01:25:49,001
Isabella! Swim! Go! Go!

1277
01:25:49,137 --> 01:25:50,935
Bella!

1278
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:55,643
Isabella!

1279
01:26:24,139 --> 01:26:25,734
Bella!

1280
01:26:25,870 --> 01:26:27,345
- Dad!
-Keep going.

1281
01:26:31,048 --> 01:26:32,548
Come on. Hey.

1282
01:26:36,723 --> 01:26:38,724
Bella!

1283
01:26:38,859 --> 01:26:40,724
- Bella!
- Bella!

1284
01:26:42,393 --> 01:26:44,388
ISABELLA
Dad!

1285
01:26:44,523 --> 01:26:47,193
Dad! Dad!

1286
01:26:47,328 --> 01:26:49,226
Bella! Bella!

1287
01:26:49,361 --> 01:26:50,794
Dad!

1288
01:26:50,929 --> 01:26:53,000
Where are you?! Help!

1289
01:26:59,371 --> 01:27:00,873
Dad!

1290
01:27:02,149 --> 01:27:05,211
- Dad! Dad!
- No. Isabella!

1291
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:12,181
No! Bella!

1292
01:27:30,074 --> 01:27:31,943
Isabella, no!

1293
01:27:32,078 --> 01:27:34,470
No. No. No.

1294
01:27:45,391 --> 01:27:47,625
Bella. Bella, come on!
Come on! Swim!

1295
01:27:47,761 --> 01:27:49,089
Come on!

1296
01:27:54,558 --> 01:27:55,932
Dad!

1297
01:27:56,067 --> 01:27:57,860
Oh, God. Dad!

1298
01:27:57,996 --> 01:27:59,063
- Bella, swim!
- Come on, Bella!

1299
01:28:00,939 --> 01:28:03,303
-Bella, it's coming!
-Come on! I got you!

1300
01:28:20,827 --> 01:28:22,295
You okay?

1301
01:28:27,333 --> 01:28:30,127
You okay? You okay?

1302
01:29:06,004 --> 01:29:07,472
Okay.

1303
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:10,442
It's a vertical slab.

1304
01:29:11,636 --> 01:29:13,506
Uh...

1305
01:29:13,642 --> 01:29:16,140
Looks like some overhang.

1306
01:29:17,613 --> 01:29:22,221
It's probably a 5.13, 5.15.

1307
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:24,390
Well, at least
we're going down.

1308
01:29:25,493 --> 01:29:28,686
I saw the pterosaur circling
a carved structure

1309
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:31,322
cut into a natural ledge.

1310
01:29:31,457 --> 01:29:34,158
They were crevice nesters,
so it's an ideal spot.

1311
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:39,428
Do we have to get a sample
from an egg?

1312
01:29:39,564 --> 01:29:41,266
I suppose we could try
and get it from the parent,

1313
01:29:41,402 --> 01:29:44,039
but they're a flying carnivore
the size of an F-16.

1314
01:29:44,174 --> 01:29:45,911
Hmm. Okay.

1315
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:47,512
Clip him in.

1316
01:29:55,648 --> 01:29:57,381
Okay.

1317
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:00,900
Alright, here we go.

1318
01:30:03,736 --> 01:30:05,530
See you at the bottom.

1319
01:30:09,502 --> 01:30:11,265
- You good?
- Good? Yeah, good.

1320
01:30:11,401 --> 01:30:13,166
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1321
01:30:13,301 --> 01:30:14,838
Ah.

1322
01:30:14,974 --> 01:30:18,008
I mean, I have a 20-foot
climbing wall in my gym, so...

1323
01:30:18,144 --> 01:30:19,278
Oh. There you go.

1324
01:30:19,413 --> 01:30:20,575
It's exactly
like climbing that.

1325
01:30:20,711 --> 01:30:23,108
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but 25 times in a row,

1326
01:30:23,244 --> 01:30:28,945
and you're 500 feet up,
so if you fall, you die.

1327
01:30:29,081 --> 01:30:30,982
Okay, well, that's unhelpful.

1328
01:30:31,117 --> 01:30:33,756
Don't worry. I got you.

1329
01:31:05,224 --> 01:31:07,089
Oh, God.

1330
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:15,259
It's fun, right?

1331
01:31:33,987 --> 01:31:35,444
Krebs.

1332
01:31:36,815 --> 01:31:37,880
Check this out.

1333
01:31:39,691 --> 01:31:41,626
Rope, rope!

1334
01:31:46,497 --> 01:31:47,731
You're doing great.

1335
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:50,466
We got another 40 feet to go.

1336
01:31:54,371 --> 01:31:56,201
Time to move.

1337
01:31:58,242 --> 01:31:59,611
Okay.

1338
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,880
See? Just like the gym.

1339
01:32:25,031 --> 01:32:26,902
<i>C'est miraculeux.</i>

1340
01:32:28,165 --> 01:32:30,500
Can you move the pitons?

1341
01:32:30,635 --> 01:32:33,103
I think we're gonna need
a couple minutes here.

1342
01:32:33,238 --> 01:32:34,712
LeCLERC:
Okay, <i>d'accord.</i>

1343
01:32:38,243 --> 01:32:40,218
What is this place? Huh?

1344
01:32:40,354 --> 01:32:42,379
Some kind of ancient temple?

1345
01:32:48,319 --> 01:32:49,957
It won't hurt the embryo.

1346
01:32:50,093 --> 01:32:54,226
Um, maybe we should, uh,
make this quick, huh?

1347
01:32:56,998 --> 01:32:58,901
Not without breaking
the egg sac.

1348
01:33:01,972 --> 01:33:04,008
You're a very impressive
nerd, Henry.

1349
01:33:09,373 --> 01:33:11,047
What would the alternative be?

1350
01:33:11,183 --> 01:33:12,551
To what?

1351
01:33:12,687 --> 01:33:15,115
To handing the samples
over to ParkerGenix.

1352
01:33:18,654 --> 01:33:20,688
We open-source it.

1353
01:33:20,824 --> 01:33:22,452
We give it to the whole world.

1354
01:33:24,026 --> 01:33:25,696
A bunch of people create
the medicine,

1355
01:33:25,831 --> 01:33:28,225
nobody owns the patent,
everyone has access,

1356
01:33:28,361 --> 01:33:31,161
and tens of millions of lives
are saved.

1357
01:33:31,296 --> 01:33:33,837
It's all of us, not some of us.

1358
01:33:37,238 --> 01:33:39,102
I don't make any money
in that scenario.

1359
01:33:39,238 --> 01:33:41,170
Oh, no, you're broke as hell.

1360
01:33:41,306 --> 01:33:44,015
Yeah, I don't love that part.

1361
01:34:13,547 --> 01:34:15,174
I've got it.

1362
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:16,742
LeCLERC
<i>Hé, Zora! Attention!</i>

1363
01:34:19,779 --> 01:34:21,184
Uh-oh.

1364
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:28,419
Hey!

1365
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,128
Hey!

1366
01:34:36,665 --> 01:34:38,704
Shit.

1367
01:34:40,768 --> 01:34:41,872
The sample!

1368
01:34:48,182 --> 01:34:49,814
Hey!

1369
01:35:01,657 --> 01:35:03,426
Oh!

1370
01:35:03,561 --> 01:35:05,528
Kincaid! Pull me up!

1371
01:35:05,664 --> 01:35:07,630
- Kincaid! Help!
- LeClerc?!

1372
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:10,402
Hey!

1373
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:12,699
Kincaid! <i>Au secours!</i>

1374
01:35:12,834 --> 01:35:15,240
Krebs, pull! Pull!

1375
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:17,501
Pull me up! Pull me up!

1376
01:35:18,511 --> 01:35:20,471
Pull me up! Pull me up!

1377
01:35:24,812 --> 01:35:25,875
You okay?

1378
01:35:26,010 --> 01:35:27,379
Yeah. You?

1379
01:35:28,717 --> 01:35:29,854
Oh, shi--

1380
01:35:31,521 --> 01:35:32,516
Oh! Quick!

1381
01:35:50,177 --> 01:35:51,238
Henry!

1382
01:35:59,881 --> 01:36:02,285
Pull! Up!

1383
01:36:02,421 --> 01:36:03,649
Pull me up!

1384
01:36:08,393 --> 01:36:09,425
Kincaid!

1385
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:10,920
Henry!

1386
01:36:11,056 --> 01:36:12,197
Henry, stop!

1387
01:36:12,332 --> 01:36:14,094
I nearly got it!

1388
01:36:14,230 --> 01:36:16,197
Henry, it's gonna snap! Stop!

1389
01:36:17,571 --> 01:36:19,700
Hold on! Pull!

1390
01:36:19,835 --> 01:36:21,864
Pull!

1391
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,204
Pull!

1392
01:36:24,773 --> 01:36:26,537
Oh, shit!

1393
01:36:27,546 --> 01:36:29,874
Oh, shit! LeClerc!

1394
01:36:46,795 --> 01:36:48,291
Come on! Here!

1395
01:37:02,606 --> 01:37:05,180
Stop. Henry! It's gonna split!

1396
01:37:06,478 --> 01:37:08,216
I've got it!

1397
01:37:13,392 --> 01:37:14,622
Oh, no.

1398
01:37:14,757 --> 01:37:17,192
Henry! Henry!

1399
01:37:18,232 --> 01:37:19,491
No!

1400
01:37:50,826 --> 01:37:51,889
Doc!

1401
01:37:52,024 --> 01:37:53,261
You okay?

1402
01:38:12,145 --> 01:38:13,809
Let's go home.

1403
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:25,421
Isabella.

1404
01:39:25,557 --> 01:39:26,655
Honey.

1405
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:28,257
Let's go.

1406
01:39:29,454 --> 01:39:30,996
We're almost there.

1407
01:39:58,991 --> 01:40:00,652
I see the helipad.

1408
01:40:00,787 --> 01:40:02,819
It's in the middle
of a reservoir.

1409
01:40:04,622 --> 01:40:06,722
No sign of the kids, though.

1410
01:40:06,858 --> 01:40:09,500
Will they even be able
to find this place?

1411
01:40:09,635 --> 01:40:10,728
Hey.

1412
01:40:11,795 --> 01:40:14,162
Hey, there's footprints here.

1413
01:40:14,298 --> 01:40:15,902
Hello?!

1414
01:40:16,037 --> 01:40:18,032
Reuben! Teresa!

1415
01:40:18,168 --> 01:40:19,809
Zora, they could be anything.
They could be animals.

1416
01:40:19,945 --> 01:40:21,509
- It could be...
- In Nikes?

1417
01:40:21,644 --> 01:40:23,047
Listen, I appreciate
what you're doing. I really do.

1418
01:40:23,183 --> 01:40:24,978
- But we are
in a crunch right now.
- Hello?!

1419
01:40:25,114 --> 01:40:26,781
- And we don't even know
if they survived the rocks.
- Reuben!

1420
01:40:26,917 --> 01:40:27,850
- Okay?
- Teresa!

1421
01:40:27,986 --> 01:40:29,384
The helicopter's coming.

1422
01:40:29,519 --> 01:40:31,014
Well, we'll just have
the pilots do a low pass

1423
01:40:31,149 --> 01:40:32,451
over the whole island
while there's still light.

1424
01:40:32,586 --> 01:40:34,119
That is an incredibly
dangerous idea.

1425
01:40:34,255 --> 01:40:35,786
Well, nobody asked you.

1426
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:38,057
Hello?!

1427
01:40:38,192 --> 01:40:40,023
Isabella!

1428
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:41,726
Hello?!

1429
01:40:42,702 --> 01:40:44,036
Hello?!

1430
01:40:44,999 --> 01:40:46,302
Hello?!

1431
01:40:47,530 --> 01:40:49,503
Anyone, please!

1432
01:40:51,544 --> 01:40:52,741
Hello?!

1433
01:40:56,815 --> 01:40:58,210
Hello?!

1434
01:40:58,346 --> 01:41:00,184
Is anyone here?!

1435
01:41:01,348 --> 01:41:02,887
Hey! Oh, my God.

1436
01:41:03,022 --> 01:41:04,413
- You made it! Oh, God.
- Oh, my God!

1437
01:41:04,548 --> 01:41:06,355
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

1438
01:41:06,490 --> 01:41:07,887
- You okay?
-
Thank God you're alive.

1439
01:41:08,023 --> 01:41:09,257
Where is he?

1440
01:41:09,393 --> 01:41:10,422
No, no, no.
Where is that son of a bitch?

1441
01:41:10,557 --> 01:41:11,921
- What? Who?
- That guy. The guy--

1442
01:41:12,056 --> 01:41:12,961
- He-he let me fall.
- Yeah, he tried to kill her.

1443
01:41:13,097 --> 01:41:15,100
Wait, wait. Who let you fall?

1444
01:41:17,901 --> 01:41:19,500
Hey, Krebs!

1445
01:41:21,901 --> 01:41:23,372
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, no.

1446
01:41:23,507 --> 01:41:24,434
He's got a gun, Teresa. No.

1447
01:41:24,570 --> 01:41:26,001
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1448
01:41:26,136 --> 01:41:27,673
Hey, let's just settle down,
everybody, okay?

1449
01:41:29,974 --> 01:41:31,110
You stopped me
calling for help!

1450
01:41:31,245 --> 01:41:33,184
You wanted me to die.

1451
01:41:33,319 --> 01:41:35,246
What are you talking about?
I tried to catch you.

1452
01:41:35,381 --> 01:41:37,252
No, no, no.

1453
01:41:37,388 --> 01:41:38,919
You looked right at me
and you let me fall!

1454
01:41:39,054 --> 01:41:40,721
She's lying.

1455
01:41:42,362 --> 01:41:43,387
If she's lying,
then why do you have a gun?

1456
01:41:43,523 --> 01:41:45,255
Because she's hysterical.

1457
01:41:46,894 --> 01:41:48,432
No, I-I'm not hysterical.
I'm homicidal!

1458
01:41:48,568 --> 01:41:50,563
- Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1459
01:41:50,698 --> 01:41:52,099
- Don't rush the guy with a gun.
- Enough.

1460
01:41:52,234 --> 01:41:53,405
Whoa. All right.

1461
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:55,099
All right.

1462
01:41:55,234 --> 01:41:57,307
Let's everybody just relax.
Why don't I take that?

1463
01:41:58,777 --> 01:42:00,002
It looks heavy.

1464
01:42:04,612 --> 01:42:08,844
And... I'll keep it safe
with me.

1465
01:42:11,453 --> 01:42:13,454
Now, we're all just gonna relax

1466
01:42:13,589 --> 01:42:16,190
and wait here
for the helicopter to arrive.

1467
01:42:16,325 --> 01:42:17,822
There's a helicopter coming?

1468
01:42:19,058 --> 01:42:20,655
Any minute. We just got
to make sure they see us.

1469
01:42:20,790 --> 01:42:22,727
Told you we'd made it.

1470
01:42:22,863 --> 01:42:24,730
Then we all get on
the helicopter and we forget

1471
01:42:24,865 --> 01:42:27,570
any ridiculous stories
about whatever she said.

1472
01:42:27,706 --> 01:42:30,769
-
I think we all need to...
- Stop talking! Stop talking.

1473
01:42:41,283 --> 01:42:42,984
It's the generator.

1474
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:45,113
They must be on a timer.

1475
01:42:49,886 --> 01:42:51,996
The generator sounds angry.

1476
01:42:52,132 --> 01:42:53,664
Maybe this place is deserted

1477
01:42:53,799 --> 01:42:55,195
in the daytime.

1478
01:42:55,331 --> 01:42:56,900
But not so deserted at night?

1479
01:43:00,374 --> 01:43:03,808
♪ When the night has come ♪

1480
01:43:03,944 --> 01:43:06,372

1484
01:43:15,612 --> 01:43:16,853
It's okay.

01:43:32,829 --> 01:43:33,835
Oh, not that thing.

1492
01:43:40,305 --> 01:43:41,873
Run!

1493
01:43:43,815 --> 01:43:45,217
Split up!

1494
01:43:47,182 --> 01:43:48,979
Go. Go, go.

1495
01:43:53,991 --> 01:43:56,118
Reuben! Reuben!

1496
01:44:02,267 --> 01:44:04,027
Teresa, get the rack!

1497
01:44:09,901 --> 01:44:11,466
What are they?

1498
01:44:11,601 --> 01:44:14,045
I don't know,
but they're mutant as shit!

1499
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:15,641
Come on, get to the back!

1500
01:44:53,613 --> 01:44:55,720
The hell is this place?

1501
01:44:55,855 --> 01:44:56,921
It's a lab.

1502
01:44:57,057 --> 01:44:59,915
Crossbreeding, mutations.

1503
01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:01,689
It's where it all happened.

1504
01:45:20,303 --> 01:45:22,275
You're missing it!
Give me the gun!

1505
01:45:22,410 --> 01:45:23,440
Get off me!

1506
01:45:39,057 --> 01:45:41,597
- Dolores.
-Bella.

1507
01:45:45,336 --> 01:45:46,364
You found us.

1508
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:48,373
Bella.

1509
01:45:51,778 --> 01:45:54,445
Yummy candy.
I'm gonna eat you all up.

1510
01:45:57,108 --> 01:45:59,850
It's okay.

1511
01:45:59,986 --> 01:46:01,914
Bella!

1512
01:46:06,993 --> 01:46:08,186
Bella!

1513
01:46:13,523 --> 01:46:16,401
Yummy candy.
I'm gonna eat you all up.

1514
01:46:19,304 --> 01:46:21,230
Yummy candy.

1515
01:46:25,069 --> 01:46:27,104
I'm gonna eat you all up.

1516
01:47:08,253 --> 01:47:09,387
Come on.

1517
01:47:09,522 --> 01:47:10,579
Come on, come on.

1518
01:48:04,642 --> 01:48:06,874
That way. Go, go, go.
Give me that.

1519
01:48:10,946 --> 01:48:12,711
<i>Hey. There's a tunnel system.</i>

1520
01:48:12,846 --> 01:48:15,151
It goes under the whole island.

1521
01:48:28,758 --> 01:48:30,961
The tunnel leads to the ocean.
There's a boat.

1522
01:48:36,574 --> 01:48:37,938
It's the helicopter.

1523
01:48:39,805 --> 01:48:42,173
I'll get the kids.
You get the pilot's attention.

1524
01:48:43,239 --> 01:48:44,445
Don't let them leave, Doc.

1525
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:46,215
Don't let them leave!

1526
01:49:12,907 --> 01:49:14,711
I can't see anyone.

1527
01:49:14,846 --> 01:49:16,740
Okay.
We circle for two minutes,

1528
01:49:16,875 --> 01:49:18,341
then get the hell out.

1529
01:49:53,214 --> 01:49:54,409
Caution. Pedestrian ahead.

1530
01:50:02,688 --> 01:50:04,055
Shit.

1531
01:50:12,265 --> 01:50:13,435
REUBEN
Down the tunnel. Quick.

1532
01:50:13,571 --> 01:50:15,006
Okay, go, go, go, go, go.

1533
01:50:15,141 --> 01:50:16,464
That way, go.

1534
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:18,306
It's okay. It's okay, Bella.

1535
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:30,780
Come on, come on, come on.

1536
01:50:30,915 --> 01:50:31,983
You okay?

1537
01:50:32,119 --> 01:50:33,281
Which way do we go?

1538
01:50:33,417 --> 01:50:34,824
To the left. Hurry!

1539
01:50:34,959 --> 01:50:36,353
- Come on. Go, go, go.
-I'm scared.

1540
01:50:51,972 --> 01:50:54,574
Okay, I'm gonna call it.

1541
01:50:54,709 --> 01:50:56,505
Let's head home.

1542
01:51:08,821 --> 01:51:12,161
Hey! Stop! Hey!

1543
01:51:12,296 --> 01:51:13,658
Down here!

1544
01:51:13,793 --> 01:51:15,832
Come back!

1545
01:51:34,848 --> 01:51:35,920
Wait!

1546
01:51:36,056 --> 01:51:36,913
There.

1547
01:51:37,049 --> 01:51:38,313
Seven o'clock, low.

1548
01:51:38,448 --> 01:51:40,483
I see it! Combing left!

1549
01:51:48,027 --> 01:51:50,661
Oh, thank God. Come on.

1550
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:56,406
Duncan!

1551
01:51:56,541 --> 01:51:58,234
They're coming back!

1552
01:52:15,061 --> 01:52:16,925
Hey!

1553
01:52:17,061 --> 01:52:19,756
Quick! Down here!

1554
01:52:39,011 --> 01:52:40,946
Loomis!

1555
01:52:41,082 --> 01:52:43,387
Kincaid, is that you?

1556
01:52:43,523 --> 01:52:44,753
- Reuben!
-Hello?!

1557
01:52:44,889 --> 01:52:46,382
- Where are you guys?!
-Hey!

1558
01:52:46,517 --> 01:52:47,917
-Down here! Hey!
-Here!

1559
01:52:48,052 --> 01:52:49,085
- Hey!
- Hey!

1560
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:50,960
Oh, thank God.

1561
01:52:52,361 --> 01:52:54,222
-Get us out of here.
-Wait, wait, wait.

1562
01:52:54,358 --> 01:52:56,361
Just wait, wait, wait, wait.

1563
01:52:58,103 --> 01:53:00,403
- Whoa, whoa.
- Did you...
did you see that thing?

1564
01:53:00,539 --> 01:53:02,565
Get inside. Get inside.

1565
01:53:05,104 --> 01:53:06,571
<i>Okay, listen up.</i>

1566
01:53:06,706 --> 01:53:08,774
This is a drainage tunnel.

1567
01:53:08,909 --> 01:53:10,542
Leads down to the sea.

1568
01:53:10,677 --> 01:53:13,043
There's a... a dock with
a boat hanging on it. I saw it.

1569
01:53:13,179 --> 01:53:14,878
Wh-What about the helicopter?

1570
01:53:15,013 --> 01:53:16,350
No helicopter.

1571
01:53:16,486 --> 01:53:17,453
What?

1572
01:53:17,589 --> 01:53:19,019
- No.
-Wait.

1573
01:53:19,154 --> 01:53:20,518
But what if the boat
doesn't work?

1574
01:53:20,653 --> 01:53:24,026
Hey. I'm not gonna let you
get hurt, okay?

1575
01:53:27,664 --> 01:53:28,932
All right. Come on.

1576
01:53:30,396 --> 01:53:32,430
This way.
Let's get to the dock.

1577
01:53:43,179 --> 01:53:44,682
- Shut up!
-Caution.

1578
01:53:44,817 --> 01:53:46,543
Pedestrian ahead.

1579
01:54:11,634 --> 01:54:13,770
Down the tunnel. Quick.

1580
01:54:13,906 --> 01:54:15,305
I don't think
this is the right way, Dad.

1581
01:54:15,441 --> 01:54:17,310
Yeah, yeah. Come on. Go, go.

1582
01:54:19,881 --> 01:54:21,017
Zora!

1583
01:54:29,628 --> 01:54:30,719
Go!

1584
01:54:31,797 --> 01:54:34,255
- Are you okay?
- Go, go.

1585
01:54:34,390 --> 01:54:36,531
Krebs took the jeep.

1586
01:54:36,666 --> 01:54:38,733
If he gets
to the boat before us,
he'll take that, too.

1587
01:54:38,868 --> 01:54:40,696
Come on, Z, we got to go.

1588
01:54:46,846 --> 01:54:47,904
There's the ocean!

1589
01:54:48,039 --> 01:54:49,012
Up there!

1590
01:54:51,951 --> 01:54:52,980
Hey, I see the boat.
It's that way.

1591
01:54:53,115 --> 01:54:54,678
How do we open the gate?

1592
01:54:54,814 --> 01:54:56,381
It's there. It's there.
The control panel.

1593
01:54:56,516 --> 01:54:57,883
I-I'll go. I'll go.

1594
01:54:58,018 --> 01:54:59,416
Can you fit through?

1595
01:54:59,552 --> 01:55:01,585
I'm trying!
I'm trying!

1596
01:55:02,956 --> 01:55:04,559
Shit.

1597
01:55:08,658 --> 01:55:10,533
Maybe we can lift it.

1598
01:55:14,998 --> 01:55:17,400
Guys? That thing is back!

1599
01:55:17,535 --> 01:55:19,367
Again! All together, lift!

1600
01:55:19,502 --> 01:55:21,708
One, two, three!

1601
01:55:26,945 --> 01:55:28,280
Hey.

1602
01:55:28,416 --> 01:55:29,743
- Hey, hey, hey. Isabella.
- Hey!

1603
01:55:29,879 --> 01:55:31,482
- No, no, no. No, no!
- Bella! Bella, wait!

1604
01:55:31,617 --> 01:55:33,423
- Bella!
- Come back here! Come here!

1605
01:55:33,558 --> 01:55:35,449
-
Careful, Bella. Be careful.
-Isabella!

1606
01:55:35,584 --> 01:55:36,756
Find the power button!

1607
01:55:57,212 --> 01:55:59,882
Hurry! We have to
open the gate!

1608
01:56:00,017 --> 01:56:01,242
It's coming! It's coming!

1609
01:56:01,377 --> 01:56:02,911
- Hey!
- Hey!

1610
01:56:03,047 --> 01:56:05,319
Hey! Bella! Open the gate!

1611
01:56:27,937 --> 01:56:29,772
Excess speed. Slow down.

1612
01:56:33,115 --> 01:56:34,110
Caution. Pedestrian ahead.

1613
01:56:42,322 --> 01:56:43,559
Go, go, go.

1614
01:56:47,030 --> 01:56:48,524
We got to go. We got to go.

1615
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:50,529
- Teresa, come on!
- Come on.

1616
01:56:54,771 --> 01:56:55,965
Now, Z, now!

1617
01:57:32,370 --> 01:57:33,639
Hurry.

1618
01:57:34,642 --> 01:57:36,342
The hoist control's
over there. Go.

1619
01:57:36,477 --> 01:57:38,181
How do you get the boat down?

1620
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:40,279
Lower the boat.

1621
01:57:40,414 --> 01:57:42,009
But where's the power?

1622
01:57:42,145 --> 01:57:43,282
-Here, take this!
-I got it. I got it.

1623
01:57:43,418 --> 01:57:44,678
Turn it on.

1624
01:57:44,813 --> 01:57:46,215
The hoist is broken.

1625
01:57:46,351 --> 01:57:47,548
It's jammed!

1626
01:57:47,684 --> 01:57:48,889
Come on, come on!

1627
01:58:00,970 --> 01:58:02,529
Bella!

1628
01:58:02,664 --> 01:58:03,770
Don't move, honey.

1629
01:58:10,544 --> 01:58:11,847
It's attracted to light!

1630
01:58:11,983 --> 01:58:13,584
Turn it off! Turn it off!

1631
01:58:13,719 --> 01:58:15,051
Give me the flares!

1632
01:58:15,187 --> 01:58:16,854
- What the hell are you doing?
- I got it.

1633
01:58:16,989 --> 01:58:18,218
- I got it. Go!
- No, no, no!

1634
01:58:18,354 --> 01:58:19,448
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hey!

1635
01:58:19,584 --> 01:58:21,788
Right here!

1636
01:58:21,924 --> 01:58:23,860
You want me?

1637
01:58:23,995 --> 01:58:25,758
Come on!

1638
01:58:25,894 --> 01:58:26,858
Come on!

1639
01:58:26,993 --> 01:58:27,925
No.

1640
01:58:28,061 --> 01:58:29,632
Duncan.

1641
01:58:29,767 --> 01:58:31,396
This way! Hey!

1642
01:58:31,531 --> 01:58:32,829
Get your sister!
Get your sister!

1643
01:58:33,939 --> 01:58:35,931
Get out of here! Go!

1644
01:58:37,567 --> 01:58:39,671
Come here! This way!

1645
01:58:40,738 --> 01:58:41,972
- Come on!
-Duncan!

1646
01:58:42,108 --> 01:58:43,272
Duncan!

1647
01:58:43,407 --> 01:58:44,744
Hey!

1648
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:46,150
Come on.

1649
01:58:47,479 --> 01:58:48,619
Don't wait, Zora!

1650
01:58:48,754 --> 01:58:50,854
Get the kids! Go!

1651
01:58:50,990 --> 01:58:52,948
- Come on!
- Save them.

1652
01:59:11,302 --> 01:59:12,902
Come on!

1653
01:59:13,876 --> 01:59:15,608
Shit.

1654
01:59:40,265 --> 01:59:41,502
Come on!

1655
01:59:44,005 --> 01:59:45,508
Yeah.

1656
01:59:58,223 --> 01:59:59,919
Go. Get in the boat.
Get in the boat.

1657
02:00:00,055 --> 02:00:02,326
- Take the helm. Take the helm.
- Grab her, grab her, grab her.

1658
02:00:03,329 --> 02:00:04,654
Come on. There's no power.

1659
02:00:04,789 --> 02:00:06,395
- Check the power!
- Zora!

1660
02:00:07,426 --> 02:00:08,491
Duncan!

1661
02:00:08,627 --> 02:00:10,898
- Duncan!
- Zora, come on.

1662
02:00:11,034 --> 02:00:12,368
Duncan!

1663
02:00:13,368 --> 02:00:14,333
- We have to go.
- Hey...

1664
02:00:14,468 --> 02:00:15,532
Come on.

1665
02:00:15,668 --> 02:00:17,304
Dad, hurry!

1666
02:00:17,439 --> 02:00:18,803
-Go. Come on!
- Dad, hurry!

1667
02:00:18,938 --> 02:00:20,501
I'm-I'm trying!

1668
02:00:20,636 --> 02:00:22,135
- I'm trying!
-
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1669
02:00:22,271 --> 02:00:24,539
I'm trying!

1670
02:00:28,546 --> 02:00:29,510
Reuben!

1671
02:00:29,645 --> 02:00:30,846
Come on, please!

1672
02:00:30,982 --> 02:00:33,524
Go! Go, push it!

1673
02:00:54,374 --> 02:00:55,576
Kincaid!

1674
02:00:57,683 --> 02:00:58,909
Duncan!

1675
02:01:23,875 --> 02:01:25,573
Dad.

1676
02:01:26,537 --> 02:01:27,740
Hey! Hey!

1677
02:01:32,249 --> 02:01:33,482
Turn the boat around!

1678
02:01:46,295 --> 02:01:47,324
There he is. I see him.

1679
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:48,996
There!

1680
02:01:49,131 --> 02:01:51,425
Yeah, there! Go!

1681
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:52,798
Hey!

1682
02:03:00,896 --> 02:03:02,571
Who do we give it to?

1683
02:03:10,344 --> 02:03:11,646
You decide.

1684
02:03:16,651 --> 02:03:18,818
We'll give it to everyone.

1685
02:03:26,128 --> 02:03:27,222
Look.
