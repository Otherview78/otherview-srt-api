re-adjusted for YIFY release by Tronar

2
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:42,644
Lucky ring on.

3
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,960
I feel so much safer.

4
00:01:44,995 --> 00:01:46,788
We're coming in hot.

5
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:31,158
Hold on.

6
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,496
Let's go.

7
00:03:58,661 --> 00:03:59,603
What's the hold up?

8
00:04:00,138 --> 00:04:01,695
Nothing, we're on our way.

9
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,653
Let's go.

10
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:23,204
Your dude's trippin'.

11
00:04:53,102 --> 00:04:55,737
Stay on the wall, beware.

12
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:27,821
- Hey, forget this maniac.
- I'm not leaving him.

13
00:05:31,942 --> 00:05:32,723
Doc!

14
00:06:17,818 --> 00:06:21,081
You're just gonna roll up on me huh?
After 8 damn years.

15
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:23,376
What's up with that?

16
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:27,001
You're in a black ops prison that
doesn't officially exist.

17
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:29,778
I just got the location from a guy named Church.

18
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,897
An agency spook.

19
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:32,803
Excuse me?

20
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:35,891
Agency's official relax.

21
00:06:35,926 --> 00:06:37,621
Thank you for this, man.

22
00:06:38,434 --> 00:06:39,842
What a waste of life!

23
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:42,072
You make one damn mistake.

24
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:43,565
It wasn't a mistake.

25
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,805
It was stupid. You'd done that to me,
I would've chopped you into pieces.

26
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,284
You would've tried.

27
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,200
Hey, you want to thank the guys?

28
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:53,206
The guys?
Where are our guys?

29
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:55,805
- Hammer, Guzman...
- Gone.

30
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,096
They've gone?

31
00:06:58,131 --> 00:06:59,683
Yeah.

32
00:07:04,484 --> 00:07:05,284
Damn!

33
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,496
Heard you killed more people than the plague!

34
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:23,006
How 'bout that?

35
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:24,932
That why they called you "Doctor Death"?

36
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:26,900
Used to be a medic.

37
00:07:28,806 --> 00:07:30,204
But that was a long time ago.

38
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:32,555
So why'd you get locked away?

39
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:36,204
Tax evasion.

40
00:07:39,632 --> 00:07:41,944
So you're all that's left of The Expendables?

41
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:43,735
We're it.

42
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,529
We started out with 5...

43
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:46,964
built up to 22

44
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:52,969
I see Barney still hanging the tags up there.

45
00:07:55,052 --> 00:07:57,684
See that jingling sounds the tags make,

46
00:07:57,719 --> 00:08:01,643
that's a reminder that our brothers are still here.

47
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,380
Somewhere.

48
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:07,666
Come on viking.

49
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,655
Give me an old school of your blade.

50
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:15,355
Or else you might find your tags up there.

51
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,527
Jingling too.

52
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:21,911
Jingling... jingling jingling.

53
00:08:27,504 --> 00:08:29,007
Sharpen it when you're done.

54
00:08:45,294 --> 00:08:47,042
I think your friend is a little off.

55
00:08:47,077 --> 00:08:49,850
Come on Christmas, he's been in
a hole for eight years.

56
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:51,045
How'd he get so lucky!

57
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,693
He tried pulling it off
his half-assed political...

58
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:56,945
assassination for a few bucks
in this place called Swaziland.

59
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,152
And he blew it.

60
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:00,579
Self destructive?

61
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:03,214
Yes something like that.
But in all those years he's a good medic.

62
00:09:03,498 --> 00:09:04,696
Well, I don't need a checkup.

63
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:06,638
- Why are you so sarcastic?
- You're vague.

64
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,350
- Vague?
- Secrets, idiot.

65
00:09:09,384 --> 00:09:12,232
I mean why do you take me off
half way round the planet?

66
00:09:12,237 --> 00:09:15,288
To save this medical genius,

67
00:09:15,323 --> 00:09:16,513
as you describe.

68
00:09:16,548 --> 00:09:17,745
For what?

69
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,212
- He's an Expendable.
- Oh my god.

70
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:20,847
Come on.

71
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:21,982
He's an Expendable.

72
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,100
So he's one of the flock?

73
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:24,290
Let me tell you something...

74
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:26,471
If you were incarcerated for years,

75
00:09:27,146 --> 00:09:28,801
I'd come and save you.

76
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,400
Thanks hero!

77
00:09:31,514 --> 00:09:32,502
But I doubt it.

78
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:34,188
And I know you'd do the same for me.

79
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:35,690
Truthfully?

80
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:37,224
You'd let me rot?

81
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:38,293
Exactly.

82
00:09:42,255 --> 00:09:43,836
Hey, Doc.

83
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:47,486
What's your name?

84
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,142
Christmas.

85
00:09:49,177 --> 00:09:50,935
Is that real?

86
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,295
Authentic.

87
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,955
Is that real too?

88
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:59,086
Oh no, I uh... spend 3 hours every morning
putting this on with a black biro.

89
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:00,695
This is real.

90
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:02,653
Authentic.

91
00:10:03,471 --> 00:10:04,633
Original.

92
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:05,691
Look at that.

93
00:10:10,968 --> 00:10:12,268
Balance is a little off.

94
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,236
You uh, a knife man?

95
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:18,698
Best, ever

96
00:10:19,463 --> 00:10:21,084
I'm the knife before Christmas.

97
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,870
Ain't that right Barney?

98
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:24,276
If you say so.

99
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:27,264
Probably freestyling with a blade while
you're still sucking on your daddy's titty...

100
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:29,233
trying to learn how to eat with a spoon.

101
00:10:29,268 --> 00:10:30,736
Yeah.

102
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:33,584
You know that little secret you were
keeping there, Mr. Vaguo?

103
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:35,119
Just stay out of my brain.

104
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,050
I'm gonna tell you.
I can't wait to get home.

105
00:10:37,143 --> 00:10:38,865
Eat some good food...

106
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,157
Put on some fine threads...

107
00:10:41,192 --> 00:10:43,199
Break up my 49' Pontiac...

108
00:10:43,234 --> 00:10:46,015
Keep that baby until the engine blows up...

109
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,100
You didn't tell him did you?

110
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,800
Tell me what?

111
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,500
We're not going home.

112
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,950
We're stopping at a
dealer named Victor Menz...

113
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,840
delivering a shipment
of thermobaric bombs.

114
00:10:57,154 --> 00:10:59,017
Ow, come on man.

115
00:10:59,052 --> 00:11:00,639
That shit is hellfire.

116
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,500
Hey, it's routine stuff.

117
00:11:01,513 --> 00:11:03,713
You know why don't you just
pick me up on your way back.

118
00:11:03,904 --> 00:11:04,904
We're a man short.

119
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,260
Well, you know, I'd love
to party with you boys.

120
00:11:07,592 --> 00:11:10,601
But, uh, I don't have my shit.

121
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:19,551
That's my shit!

122
00:11:19,598 --> 00:11:20,577
It is your shit.

123
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:27,121
Doc, have you thanked the guys,
helping you out?

124
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:32,087
Say something.

125
00:11:38,618 --> 00:11:39,783
Uh, listen up...

126
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,134
It's been a long time since I had
a reason to say thank you...

127
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:47,639
So I just want..

128
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:50,450
Oh, you know I...

129
00:11:50,485 --> 00:11:52,382
- He's getting his rhythm.
- Just want to say.

130
00:11:58,256 --> 00:11:59,065
Thank you.

131
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,676
Sincerity is overwhelming.

132
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:02,870
I think I'm gonna weep.

133
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:03,785
You know what? Enough.

134
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:07,678
Do not be sarcastic.

135
00:12:08,213 --> 00:12:10,637
That was great, Doc.

136
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:12,322
You haven't had to talk for a long time.

137
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,690
You got the gift.

138
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:15,050
It's like riding a bike.

139
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:16,668
I liked Churchill's best.

140
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,359
I think I made my point.

141
00:12:18,394 --> 00:12:21,776
- I've moved you too.
- Stunning.

142
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,866
Doc, great to have you back.

143
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,446
No better place to be, yeah.

144
00:13:04,937 --> 00:13:06,669
About time you boys showed up.

145
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:11,537
Nice boat.

146
00:13:11,572 --> 00:13:13,056
Thanks ladies, built it myself.

147
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:16,154
Got three more just like it patrolling the harbor.

148
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:18,300
Two man ground teams every 400m.

149
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:19,738
Good work.

150
00:13:19,773 --> 00:13:21,775
Just cause you can fly a plane
don't make you smarter than me.

151
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,565
Sure it does.

152
00:13:24,795 --> 00:13:26,913
So you're the reason I've been
stuck down here in this shithole.

153
00:13:26,948 --> 00:13:27,993
Shithole?

154
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:30,628
Brother you have no idea.

155
00:13:32,033 --> 00:13:32,753
Oh yeah, hahahaha.

156
00:13:35,217 --> 00:13:36,176
What the hell is that?

157
00:13:36,211 --> 00:13:38,315
This bitch will solve all your problems.

158
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,007
Yeah, maybe for 10 seconds...

159
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:43,138
- before he blows his wad.
- So now you got that problem too?

160
00:13:46,547 --> 00:13:48,023
You walked into that one.

161
00:13:49,644 --> 00:13:50,924
Come on, look alive, look alive.

162
00:14:03,014 --> 00:14:03,814
Good luck.

163
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:01,942
It was all under control.

164
00:15:02,382 --> 00:15:03,702
Yeah, that's what it looked like.

165
00:15:09,135 --> 00:15:09,700
Where you've been?

166
00:15:09,735 --> 00:15:11,345
I had a doctors' appointment.

167
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:15,172
Catch up with you boys later.

168
00:15:16,855 --> 00:15:17,482
What's he got?

169
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:30,311
Watch your overhead.

170
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,875
Doc, go.

171
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:32,575
Ooh sadly, the man attacked me with a knife.

172
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:35,034
He's good.

173
00:16:35,055 --> 00:16:36,075
Maybe to you.

174
00:16:41,173 --> 00:16:42,299
You might want to see this.

175
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,392
See what?

176
00:16:43,427 --> 00:16:44,450
I'll show you.

177
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:18,533
Damn!

178
00:17:18,563 --> 00:17:19,585
He's really good.

179
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,900
Say it again and I'll shoot you.

180
00:17:23,688 --> 00:17:24,654
Get in.

181
00:17:40,806 --> 00:17:41,887
Where's the bomb?

182
00:17:41,922 --> 00:17:43,153
It'll be here.

183
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:47,411
Barney, looks like the target is right on time.

184
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,597
There's Menz, let's take 'em out fast.

185
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:54,569
Barney, I'm gonna put you down.

186
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,703
It can't be.

187
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:13,719
What can't be?

188
00:18:13,754 --> 00:18:15,234
We're gonna shoot these guys or what?

189
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:16,940
What's the hold up?

190
00:18:16,975 --> 00:18:18,163
He's dead.

191
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:20,448
Who's dead?

192
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,357
Stonebanks.

193
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,958
Stonebanks.

194
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,167
Come on, get in.

195
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,286
Come on, move!
Go go go!

196
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:03,390
Come on!

197
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:05,635
Time to mow the lawn!

198
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:21,806
I told you

199
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:22,788
10 seconds.

200
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:30,922
Hang on.

201
00:19:30,957 --> 00:19:32,113
Found you a ride.

202
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:40,312
Time to go.

203
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,900
Come on.
Go go go!

204
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,740
- How much we're getting paid for this?
- Not enough.

205
00:20:20,328 --> 00:20:20,928
Go right.

206
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,412
You're not gonna fit.

207
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:52,389
Always negative.

208
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:05,683
I'm getting carsick.

209
00:21:09,385 --> 00:21:10,548
Hang on, Doc.

210
00:21:25,466 --> 00:21:26,066
Get out.

211
00:21:37,114 --> 00:21:37,913
Come on.

212
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:49,536
Caesar.

213
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:50,945
We're coming your way, where are you?

214
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,405
In this filthy river, behind you.

215
00:21:55,508 --> 00:21:57,199
Try to stay as close as you can.

216
00:22:02,374 --> 00:22:03,692
Make room for Caeser.

217
00:22:04,127 --> 00:22:06,602
Move your ass in.

218
00:22:10,737 --> 00:22:11,467
Who's that?

219
00:22:11,502 --> 00:22:13,297
A huge black guy on a boat.

220
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:28,251
Hold it, hold it, you got it going.

221
00:22:34,617 --> 00:22:35,988
- You alright?
- Yeah.

222
00:22:42,324 --> 00:22:43,339
Pull over.

223
00:23:28,503 --> 00:23:30,649
Incoming!

224
00:23:31,904 --> 00:23:32,883
Move!

225
00:23:32,918 --> 00:23:34,081
Move!

226
00:23:34,116 --> 00:23:35,618
We got you man, come on!

227
00:26:11,046 --> 00:26:12,597
Maybe this'll bring you luck.

228
00:26:40,887 --> 00:26:41,916
Is he gonna make it?

229
00:26:41,951 --> 00:26:43,253
I don't know.

230
00:26:43,288 --> 00:26:44,127
Who did this?

231
00:26:44,162 --> 00:26:46,530
Stonebanks.

232
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,180
I thought you killed him.

233
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,074
So did I.

234
00:26:52,388 --> 00:26:54,073
He shot Caeser to get back at me.

235
00:26:55,731 --> 00:26:57,635
Yeah, I'm getting out of this business.

236
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,600
And so should you.

237
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,900
Not yet.

238
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,800
Hey.

239
00:27:05,276 --> 00:27:06,976
If you need any help with
Stonebanks...

240
00:27:27,075 --> 00:27:29,008
I'm supposed to meet a guy named Church.

241
00:27:29,043 --> 00:27:30,163
I know who you are.

242
00:27:30,198 --> 00:27:31,745
So who are you?

243
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,892
Operations officer Drummer.

244
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,552
You don't have to worry about Church anymore.

245
00:27:38,608 --> 00:27:41,525
He's um, he's out of the picture

246
00:27:43,885 --> 00:27:44,941
Jesus, Ross.

247
00:27:44,976 --> 00:27:46,675
What a mess!

248
00:27:47,871 --> 00:27:48,971
We gave you everything.

249
00:27:49,006 --> 00:27:53,053
Target, opportunity, all the intel you could ask for.

250
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,787
And you got decimated.

251
00:27:56,822 --> 00:27:59,431
And my target walked away.

252
00:27:59,466 --> 00:28:00,688
Am I wrong huh?

253
00:28:01,123 --> 00:28:02,173
Am I missing something?

254
00:28:02,208 --> 00:28:06,645
Yeah, sure you said the target's name was Victor Menz.

255
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,652
- And?
- It was wrong.

256
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:11,167
His real name was Conrad Stonebanks.

257
00:28:13,347 --> 00:28:16,472
We knew him only as Victor Menz.

258
00:28:17,314 --> 00:28:19,740
Arms dealer, made billions selling to every

259
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:22,166
psycho warlord in Africa and the Middle East.

260
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:26,106
His own mercenary army is personally responsible...

261
00:28:26,141 --> 00:28:29,833
for the torturing and killing...

262
00:28:29,868 --> 00:28:32,353
two of the best men I ever knew, friends.

263
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:35,405
I don't give a shit what his name is.

264
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,029
I don't like him.

265
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:39,814
I want him as bad as you do.

266
00:28:41,081 --> 00:28:43,467
This happened on my watch.

267
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:48,424
You fucked up, and I'm wearing it

268
00:28:51,874 --> 00:28:53,211
I'll find him.

269
00:28:53,246 --> 00:28:54,222
Again.

270
00:28:54,257 --> 00:28:56,570
You have one more shot.

271
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:01,674
Nice to finally meet you Barney.

272
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:10,425
Your men are shot to shit, what are
you gonna do for a team.

273
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,577
Don't worry about it.
I'll handle it.

274
00:29:15,816 --> 00:29:17,402
Relax.

275
00:29:18,732 --> 00:29:20,877
You're gonna give yourself a stroke.

276
00:29:22,545 --> 00:29:24,866
What's with these guys!

277
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:26,234
Do you mind?

278
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,876
Do you think when the artist
painted this, he ever

279
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:03,781
thought it would go for
such a ridiculous price?

280
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:09,790
I mean what is this? Just some paint, brushes,
some cheap canvas, what's the big deal?

281
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:16,011
It's shit.

282
00:30:16,046 --> 00:30:17,098
What do you want for it?

283
00:30:17,133 --> 00:30:18,431
Three million.

284
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:20,322
Done.

285
00:30:29,371 --> 00:30:30,151
You know...

286
00:30:30,186 --> 00:30:32,971
It's very hard for me to say this...

287
00:30:33,006 --> 00:30:35,713
but at one time, you guys were the best.

288
00:30:37,113 --> 00:30:38,095
Maybe still are.

289
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,754
But nothing lasts forever.

290
00:30:45,749 --> 00:30:48,144
Hard as it is to hear.

291
00:30:51,352 --> 00:30:53,177
We're not the future anymore.

292
00:30:53,212 --> 00:30:54,873
Unfortunately for us.

293
00:30:54,908 --> 00:30:56,626
We're part of the past.

294
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:04,127
You.. arr.. you going somewhere with this?

295
00:31:05,747 --> 00:31:06,737
As I see it.

296
00:31:07,572 --> 00:31:10,442
If we keep this life up...

297
00:31:10,593 --> 00:31:12,942
The only way this thing ends...

298
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:15,891
for all of us

299
00:31:18,985 --> 00:31:21,751
is in a hole in the ground and no-one givin' a shit.

300
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:26,411
Now, if that's the
way I'm supposed

301
00:31:26,436 --> 00:31:28,018
to go out, I can live with that.

302
00:31:30,487 --> 00:31:31,359
For me.

303
00:31:33,937 --> 00:31:35,652
But what I can't live with.

304
00:31:36,903 --> 00:31:38,464
And I won't live with...

305
00:31:41,101 --> 00:31:43,071
is taking you with me.

306
00:31:43,106 --> 00:31:45,218
What are you saying?
That's our call.

307
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:47,500
I'm changing things now.

308
00:31:49,856 --> 00:31:51,402
You.

309
00:31:51,437 --> 00:31:53,194
Me.

310
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:56,191
All of us.

311
00:31:59,846 --> 00:32:00,619
It's over.

312
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:02,676
We're done.

313
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:05,643
Done? You break me out...

314
00:32:05,778 --> 00:32:06,795
Cut me loose?

315
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,663
You'll survive.

316
00:32:08,898 --> 00:32:10,169
You all will.

317
00:32:13,128 --> 00:32:14,994
You live your lives while you can.

318
00:32:19,908 --> 00:32:21,028
Where are you going, Barney?

319
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:35,093
Hey you think you just pulled the plug and that's it?

320
00:32:35,128 --> 00:32:36,671
- Just did.
- Yeah?

321
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:38,147
Well it doesn't work that way.

322
00:32:38,182 --> 00:32:39,456
What?

323
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:40,930
We've been through the mud...

324
00:32:40,965 --> 00:32:42,440
the shit and the blood.

325
00:32:42,475 --> 00:32:44,626
And I've saved your arse more times than I can count.

326
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:50,067
You owe me a shot at the sonofabitch
that took Caeser down.

327
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:53,731
We're not doing that.

328
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,047
When I joined,

329
00:33:03,474 --> 00:33:04,699
I joined for the whole ride.

330
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:07,696
I know you did.

331
00:33:10,514 --> 00:33:11,670
Rides over.

332
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,375
Bonaparte.

333
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,021
Sorry to hear about Caeser.

334
00:34:36,056 --> 00:34:38,671
I hope he pulls through, he's a
good one, the good ones are rare.

335
00:34:38,706 --> 00:34:39,442
Yeah.

336
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:41,407
Well, here we are again.

337
00:34:41,442 --> 00:34:42,316
What do you need?

338
00:34:42,351 --> 00:34:43,545
New team.

339
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,512
Retired the old ones.

340
00:34:45,547 --> 00:34:47,554
Welcome to the 21st century.

341
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:50,129
How many guys you looking for?

342
00:34:50,162 --> 00:34:53,431
Young, hungry, willing to take a bullet.

343
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,641
I'm going after Stonebanks.

344
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,279
Stonebanks.

345
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,161
Let's see, you're not the
only one slipping a notch.

346
00:34:59,186 --> 00:35:01,106
Stonebanks is dead my friend mortus dei.

347
00:35:01,483 --> 00:35:02,189
No, he's not.

348
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:06,192
That is not good.

349
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:09,472
If he was half of what he used to be,
four or five ain't gonna cut it.

350
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:10,919
You're gonna need fifty.

351
00:35:10,954 --> 00:35:12,147
We gotta move fast, no time.

352
00:35:12,182 --> 00:35:14,567
If I got to do it fast then I can't guarantee the best.

353
00:35:14,602 --> 00:35:16,180
Just give me something that don't give a damn.

354
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:17,623
What?

355
00:35:17,658 --> 00:35:18,675
Is this a one way ticket?

356
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,362
Could be.

357
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,000
Fine.

358
00:35:23,152 --> 00:35:25,325
I got a line on a few head cases.

359
00:35:25,543 --> 00:35:27,943
Couple of these guys'll probably
end up shooting themselves.

360
00:35:28,818 --> 00:35:29,520
Wait.

361
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:31,955
What about these guys?
They anything?

362
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,920
These guys are pussies.

363
00:35:39,536 --> 00:35:42,536
Goes by Thorn, expert hacker.

364
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,699
Ground pilot.

365
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,328
Did 18 months for hacking into
Seattle central operating system.

366
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:48,645
Shut down the whole city for 3 days.

367
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,122
Why the hell would he do that?

368
00:35:50,157 --> 00:35:51,384
Because he can.

369
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:54,484
What?

370
00:35:55,665 --> 00:35:57,492
I'm not looking for an office worker.

371
00:35:57,527 --> 00:35:58,812
Oh! that's not him.

372
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,700
That's him.

373
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:09,832
Another one with a death wish.
You two got a lot in common.

374
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,700
I could do that.

375
00:36:21,953 --> 00:36:22,753
You know what?

376
00:36:22,788 --> 00:36:23,982
I'm gonna come around and say it.

377
00:36:24,017 --> 00:36:25,770
I belong on you.

378
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:38,977
- You can't do that.
- No.

379
00:36:39,012 --> 00:36:40,979
I'd want a special rate on that one.

380
00:36:41,014 --> 00:36:43,538
Yeah, yeah, that's the pecker.

381
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:49,828
Always on the damn road going
someplace you don't give a damn about.

382
00:36:49,863 --> 00:36:51,127
Beats standing still.

383
00:36:51,162 --> 00:36:52,384
Yeah, I got two ex-wives...

384
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:54,499
and three kids who've lost my number who'd disagree.

385
00:37:00,081 --> 00:37:02,801
- Hey did you turn off the autopilot?
- I didn't touch the autopilot.

386
00:37:03,049 --> 00:37:04,100
Gimme the booze.

387
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,810
Are we off course?

388
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,741
Where the hell are we?
Hang on a second.

389
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:12,668
Is that the Big Dipper?

390
00:37:12,703 --> 00:37:14,031
Yeah, we gotta turn around.

391
00:37:16,445 --> 00:37:20,303
Next candidate is an expert in field
craft and close quarters combat.

392
00:37:22,578 --> 00:37:23,358
Luna.

393
00:37:23,393 --> 00:37:24,354
Hi.

394
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:28,089
Young lady, meet a friend of mine. Barney Ross.
Barney Ross, Luna. Luna, Barney Ross.

395
00:37:28,144 --> 00:37:29,744
- How you're doing?
- Nice to meet you Mr. Ross.

396
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:32,089
Gentlemen if you'd follow me,
I have your table waiting.

397
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,982
Come on.
Live a little.

398
00:37:34,654 --> 00:37:35,603
So Luna how are things?

399
00:37:35,638 --> 00:37:37,238
You know, gets old.

400
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,900
- What did I do?
- You wanna go, bro?

401
00:37:41,046 --> 00:37:42,874
Would you guys excuse me...

402
00:37:44,236 --> 00:37:45,676
All right so what are we doing here?

403
00:37:45,707 --> 00:37:46,697
Have a drink.

404
00:37:47,507 --> 00:37:48,669
Where's your candidate?

405
00:37:48,704 --> 00:37:52,108
Right there in the red dress about
to chop those guys in half.

406
00:37:56,146 --> 00:37:58,644
- The hostess?
- Not the hostess.

407
00:37:58,679 --> 00:37:59,686
She's the bouncer.

408
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,131
I could do that.

409
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:24,046
You want to slip on a dress and give it a shot.

410
00:38:27,712 --> 00:38:28,583
Men.

411
00:38:32,504 --> 00:38:33,559
She's good.

412
00:38:33,594 --> 00:38:35,631
You oughta see her without heels.

413
00:38:43,746 --> 00:38:45,255
When was your last checkup?

414
00:38:45,537 --> 00:38:47,092
I don't know, a while back.

415
00:38:47,127 --> 00:38:49,199
High cholesterol, plaque, all that stuff.

416
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Yeah.

417
00:38:50,218 --> 00:38:51,518
Except with me.

418
00:38:53,527 --> 00:38:54,787
They found a lump on my lung.

419
00:38:56,653 --> 00:38:58,126
Very dark, they said.

420
00:38:58,161 --> 00:39:00,663
Why shouldn't I see that coming?

421
00:39:02,843 --> 00:39:05,653
Well, what do you do?

422
00:39:05,788 --> 00:39:08,644
I try to make as much money as I can,
fast as I can.

423
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,347
For those kids, you know.
The ones I don't talk to.

424
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,782
Make some kind of a good impression
on them, before I'm gone.

425
00:39:16,557 --> 00:39:17,929
Sad, isn't it?

426
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:19,905
Yeah, it is sad. I'm sorry.

427
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,944
Nah, that's all bullshit, I'm fine.

428
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:24,048
Just checking you're still human.

429
00:39:29,572 --> 00:39:31,079
Had you going there now didn't I?

430
00:39:31,114 --> 00:39:32,555
Yeah, you did goddammit.

431
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:35,016
That can never happen again.
I'll never trust you again.

432
00:39:35,051 --> 00:39:37,167
Next kid's a bit of a dark horse.

433
00:39:37,202 --> 00:39:41,150
Just came across my desk. I don't
like throwing in a wildcard.

434
00:39:41,185 --> 00:39:43,651
But this guy's creds were too good to pass up.

435
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,606
Anybody seen Felipe?

436
00:39:48,851 --> 00:39:51,141
Yo Felipe.

437
00:39:58,522 --> 00:39:59,681
Looks good Bonaparte.

438
00:40:00,727 --> 00:40:01,641
Yeah, not bad.

439
00:40:01,676 --> 00:40:03,652
Finally got it right.

440
00:40:09,801 --> 00:40:10,899
Damn!

441
00:40:16,802 --> 00:40:17,462
Felipe Silva!

442
00:40:17,497 --> 00:40:18,823
Meet Barney Ross.

443
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:21,947
Galgo.

444
00:40:22,966 --> 00:40:25,075
Galgo, you sent me another fake resume.

445
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:29,081
Mr. Ross, I can do what you need, whatever you need.

446
00:40:29,116 --> 00:40:31,365
I am healthier than I look, stronger than I look...

447
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,666
Faster than I look.

448
00:40:32,701 --> 00:40:35,550
Actually, shit, you were born in 1984?

449
00:40:35,585 --> 00:40:36,639
Of course not.

450
00:40:36,674 --> 00:40:38,674
But I feel like that I was born in 1984.

451
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:40,509
Do not waste your time, Barney we're leaving.

452
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,094
Mr. Ross, Mr. Ross, Mr. Ross.

453
00:40:42,129 --> 00:40:43,722
Please.

454
00:40:43,757 --> 00:40:47,835
It's like uh, it's like I have discovered..
the fountain of youth.

455
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:51,075
I mean, not.. 'The fountain of youth'.

456
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,175
Ponce de Leon discovered that one.

457
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,441
Um by the way...

458
00:40:54,476 --> 00:40:57,823
Another great Spaniard, like myself.

459
00:40:57,858 --> 00:41:00,061
Mr. Ross.

460
00:41:00,096 --> 00:41:03,671
Age is just a state of mind.

461
00:41:05,272 --> 00:41:07,697
You're only old, when you surrender...

462
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:10,872
When you give up, and I haven't, not yet.

463
00:41:10,907 --> 00:41:12,555
- Galgo, this shit has got to stop.
- I gotta go.

464
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,026
This is the third time this month.

465
00:41:14,061 --> 00:41:15,855
Seriously, move on.

466
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,680
What's this guy's story?

467
00:41:17,715 --> 00:41:19,231
Actually I feel a little sorry for him.

468
00:41:19,266 --> 00:41:20,531
His last team dropped him.

469
00:41:20,566 --> 00:41:22,919
Back in the day, you couldn't catch him.

470
00:41:22,954 --> 00:41:25,810
- Very fast, maybe even faster than you.
- No way.

471
00:41:25,845 --> 00:41:26,695
Oh! maybe.

472
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,275
But, what am I gonna say.

473
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,783
It's a young man's game.

474
00:41:31,745 --> 00:41:33,182
I need a job!

475
00:41:33,217 --> 00:41:39,339
All I know what to do is killing people
And I do that very well.

476
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:42,115
Damn! Dammit!

477
00:41:50,857 --> 00:41:54,951
- What's the story on this guy?
- Found him at DARPA.

478
00:41:55,686 --> 00:41:57,866
- DARPA?
- Sounds like a town in North Africa.

479
00:41:57,867 --> 00:41:59,586
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

480
00:41:59,621 --> 00:42:02,689
Where they send the brightest military
minds to develop next-gen weapons.

481
00:42:02,824 --> 00:42:04,663
Google it.

482
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:06,655
I'm not looking for weapons nerd.

483
00:42:08,179 --> 00:42:09,779
Ah, then you've come to the right place.

484
00:42:14,412 --> 00:42:15,161
Yo Marlito.

485
00:42:23,562 --> 00:42:25,151
Mars I like you to meet Barney Ross.

486
00:42:25,186 --> 00:42:27,684
As shooters go, Mars is as gifted as they get.

487
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:28,846
Whatever you say.

488
00:42:29,721 --> 00:42:30,563
What do you say?

489
00:42:30,598 --> 00:42:33,401
What I've got here is an X-25 assault rifle.

490
00:42:33,436 --> 00:42:36,285
Laser range, 25mm high explosive air burst rounds.

491
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,821
Can be programmed to detonate
over or behind the target.

492
00:42:49,052 --> 00:42:49,789
He'll do.

493
00:42:53,394 --> 00:42:57,581
Final candidate, John Smilee.
Guy's got the most teeth in the industry.

494
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:00,695
A lot of skills, Marines, special operator.

495
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,650
- But there is, an issue.
- What issue?

496
00:43:03,377 --> 00:43:06,645
Yeah, classic authority problem.

497
00:43:09,102 --> 00:43:11,174
There's a couple more swimming around in there too.

498
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:45,118
Sorry Barney for wasting your time like this.
He's not the guy I thought he was.

499
00:43:45,153 --> 00:43:46,370
No.

500
00:43:46,405 --> 00:43:47,402
I want to meet him.

501
00:43:55,934 --> 00:43:56,677
John.

502
00:43:56,712 --> 00:43:58,607
Meet Barney Ross.

503
00:44:00,465 --> 00:44:02,657
Didn't do much to impress out there today did you?

504
00:44:03,392 --> 00:44:05,678
You called me, I didn't call you.

505
00:44:05,713 --> 00:44:07,617
Think you'd die for the money?

506
00:44:09,548 --> 00:44:11,988
Maybe you like getting your ass
kicked in front of strangers.

507
00:44:21,847 --> 00:44:23,297
What do you guys want from me?

508
00:44:24,725 --> 00:44:25,954
You running from something?

509
00:44:26,932 --> 00:44:28,409
I don't know you.

510
00:44:28,444 --> 00:44:29,617
But I know you.

511
00:44:29,652 --> 00:44:30,603
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

512
00:44:30,638 --> 00:44:31,337
How's that?

513
00:44:31,372 --> 00:44:34,753
Maybe he thinks you got potential and
we're short on time. That about right?

514
00:44:34,788 --> 00:44:36,157
That's about it.

515
00:44:36,192 --> 00:44:37,609
What's your problem?

516
00:44:37,644 --> 00:44:41,230
Your problem is you're rolling around
in the dirt for chump change.

517
00:44:42,565 --> 00:44:44,953
I hear you lost a few friends in the desert.

518
00:44:44,988 --> 00:44:47,199
They bought it, and you didn't.

519
00:44:47,234 --> 00:44:48,323
And you wear the guilt.

520
00:44:49,371 --> 00:44:50,677
I've been there.

521
00:44:50,712 --> 00:44:52,262
He's been there.

522
00:44:52,297 --> 00:44:54,121
We all lived it.

523
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:57,351
Well you don't know me.

524
00:44:57,386 --> 00:44:59,057
I know the type.

525
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,884
Bonaparte, you're right.

526
00:45:12,035 --> 00:45:13,235
You did waste my time.

527
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,500
Hey...

528
00:45:25,399 --> 00:45:26,532
You didn't waste your time.

529
00:45:43,362 --> 00:45:46,530
If you're going after Stonebanks,
we might want to talk about financials now.

530
00:45:46,565 --> 00:45:48,860
Normally it's just 10%, but..

531
00:45:48,895 --> 00:45:55,400
I figured with Stonebanks in the equation
I might want to get my fee... possibly now.

532
00:45:57,114 --> 00:46:00,379
I mean, not that you're not good for it,
just, if you don't mind.

533
00:46:00,414 --> 00:46:01,679
I don't mind.

534
00:46:02,214 --> 00:46:04,624
It sounds like you don't have too much faith in me.

535
00:46:04,959 --> 00:46:07,065
I don't.

536
00:46:35,781 --> 00:46:37,394
How was your vacation?

537
00:46:37,429 --> 00:46:38,880
Ready to go to work?

538
00:46:38,915 --> 00:46:40,284
You find him yet?

539
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,794
He's in Bucharest putting together
a deal with some Albanian mobster.

540
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:46,387
You got 36 hours, that's your window.

541
00:46:46,776 --> 00:46:48,462
After that he's back off the grid.

542
00:46:48,497 --> 00:46:50,527
Satellite map...

543
00:46:50,562 --> 00:46:52,739
Coordinates for where he'll be.

544
00:46:54,387 --> 00:46:55,828
Interesting guy.

545
00:46:56,943 --> 00:46:58,532
Your friend Stonebanks.

546
00:46:58,567 --> 00:46:59,887
You're not gonna like this but...

547
00:47:00,425 --> 00:47:01,666
They want him alive.

548
00:47:01,901 --> 00:47:03,635
Are you kidding me?

549
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:06,100
They want to try him at The Hague...

550
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,655
for war crimes.

551
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,000
You're gonna give this guy a chance in court?

552
00:47:12,031 --> 00:47:13,076
It's not my decision.

553
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,538
- No, it never is.
- That's the way it's gotta be.

554
00:47:18,671 --> 00:47:20,015
Great.

555
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,609
Agency's got a local safehouse.

556
00:47:24,616 --> 00:47:26,006
You're gonna need it.

557
00:47:27,197 --> 00:47:28,698
Don't trash the place.

558
00:48:14,494 --> 00:48:15,398
I heard you got a job.

559
00:48:15,433 --> 00:48:16,486
That's right.

560
00:48:17,649 --> 00:48:19,133
Who the hell are they?

561
00:48:19,168 --> 00:48:20,463
They're with me.

562
00:48:23,553 --> 00:48:24,856
And we're not?

563
00:48:24,891 --> 00:48:27,985
Gunner I had told you everything
I had to tell you back at the bar.

564
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:29,060
And stop drinking so much.

565
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,263
You want to get yourself killed...

566
00:48:32,298 --> 00:48:33,959
with those youngsters.

567
00:48:36,203 --> 00:48:38,083
Do us all a favor and get the hell out of here.

568
00:48:41,311 --> 00:48:42,471
Wheels up in 10.

569
00:48:53,437 --> 00:48:54,980
If your guys wanted to fight,

570
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,632
why didn't they just get married?

571
00:48:57,166 --> 00:49:00,203
You seriously smoking next to aviation fuel?

572
00:49:07,725 --> 00:49:08,686
Amateur.

573
00:49:09,021 --> 00:49:11,371
Amateur assholes.

574
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:13,258
Who you calling asshole, grandpa?

575
00:49:14,115 --> 00:49:16,861
Grandpa's about to crush your windpipe.

576
00:49:19,463 --> 00:49:21,247
What is this? Is this your toy?

577
00:49:21,282 --> 00:49:22,830
Boy?

578
00:49:22,865 --> 00:49:25,010
You want to dance big guy?

579
00:49:27,123 --> 00:49:28,737
Hey! It's just a job.

580
00:49:31,444 --> 00:49:32,739
Come on, let's go.

581
00:49:33,903 --> 00:49:35,937
Bunch of ass has been's still trying to be hard.

582
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,335
You're young and you're dumb.

583
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:49,923
Jingling jingling.

584
00:49:52,099 --> 00:49:52,944
Keep it.

585
00:49:54,354 --> 00:49:55,409
You're gonna need it.

586
00:50:06,047 --> 00:50:07,767
Never thought you would call in that favor.

587
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:10,139
I'm also not happy about it.

588
00:50:46,817 --> 00:50:47,871
Got a minute?

589
00:50:51,157 --> 00:50:52,220
What do you need?

590
00:50:52,255 --> 00:50:54,926
Tell me more about this guy we're going after.

591
00:50:54,961 --> 00:50:57,690
It doesn't matter, you were hired to do a job.

592
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,880
How about answering why we're doing this job?

593
00:51:06,588 --> 00:51:08,603
I owe you a salary that's it.

594
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,911
Why are we going after Stonebanks?

595
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:16,593
You have a hard time taking orders don't you?

596
00:51:16,628 --> 00:51:18,427
If I don't know what they are, yeah.

597
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:24,582
I know you don't give a damn about us.

598
00:51:24,617 --> 00:51:25,957
I get that.

599
00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:30,459
But just tell me why you want
to take out this guy so bad.

600
00:53:30,286 --> 00:53:31,756
Thirty seconds to drop.

601
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:32,924
Copy that.

602
00:53:34,327 --> 00:53:34,927
Let's go.

603
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,414
I can take care of myself.

604
00:53:41,449 --> 00:53:43,318
Twenty seconds to drop.

605
00:53:48,657 --> 00:53:50,070
Ten seconds...

606
00:54:49,585 --> 00:54:50,785
We're on.

607
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,200
This guy's got more muscle than a cartel king.

608
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,900
Maybe he's overcompensating for something.

609
00:55:04,928 --> 00:55:07,128
What you're drinking down there, Barney?
Is that like vanilla latte or something?

610
00:55:07,161 --> 00:55:07,961
Stay sharp.

611
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:09,816
Move.

612
00:55:09,851 --> 00:55:12,597
You have to think about this again Mr. Menz.

613
00:55:12,632 --> 00:55:14,886
I promise you this won't happen again.

614
00:55:14,921 --> 00:55:16,461
- Move the car.
- I'm talking to you!

615
00:55:38,273 --> 00:55:39,496
Nice driving Mars.

616
00:55:39,531 --> 00:55:40,760
Good performance.

617
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,314
Yeah, too good.

618
00:55:42,349 --> 00:55:43,976
Any closer and I'd beat his ass.

619
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:45,039
I believe her.

620
00:55:45,074 --> 00:55:46,125
Got 'em.

621
00:55:54,991 --> 00:55:56,951
Oh man, this guy's protected better than the president.

622
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:58,812
Yeah, and his crib's like a 5-star fortress.

623
00:55:58,847 --> 00:56:00,207
Listen we're not taking him there.

624
00:56:00,469 --> 00:56:02,661
I bet the hotel is full of guests.

625
00:56:02,896 --> 00:56:03,856
So where do we hit them?

626
00:56:03,947 --> 00:56:04,607
At the meet.

627
00:56:05,242 --> 00:56:06,649
We'll hit him from all four sides.

628
00:56:07,384 --> 00:56:08,583
Hit him hard.

629
00:56:09,885 --> 00:56:10,730
OK, um, so...

630
00:56:10,765 --> 00:56:15,569
Our plan is to what? Kick down the
door and start spraying bullets?

631
00:56:15,604 --> 00:56:16,584
It's a great plan...

632
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:17,881
If it's 1985.

633
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,236
And what's that supposed to mean?

634
00:56:20,556 --> 00:56:21,429
You heard me.

635
00:56:25,056 --> 00:56:27,129
You got a better plan?

636
00:56:27,164 --> 00:56:28,113
Much better.

637
00:56:28,148 --> 00:56:29,352
Let's hear it.

638
00:56:29,387 --> 00:56:31,071
Thorn, you're up.

639
00:56:32,731 --> 00:56:33,931
OK, I'm the plan.

640
00:56:36,673 --> 00:56:37,555
This better be good.

641
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:39,453
First I hack the security grid main server, boom.

642
00:56:39,488 --> 00:56:42,615
Bypass the motion detector lasers
and biometric sensors, pow.

643
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:46,581
Override the surveillance videos
and CCTV systems, ba-bam.

644
00:56:46,616 --> 00:56:48,230
And we are in.

645
00:56:49,856 --> 00:56:51,606
It's child play.

646
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:53,619
Just like that?

647
00:56:53,654 --> 00:56:54,678
Just like that.

648
00:56:54,713 --> 00:56:56,265
Just like that.

649
00:56:56,266 --> 00:56:58,328
Exactly, like that.

650
00:57:04,517 --> 00:57:06,098
You better be right.

651
00:57:06,699 --> 00:57:07,599
Ba-bam.

652
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,900
Ba-bam.

653
00:57:09,028 --> 00:57:09,803
Let's go.

654
00:57:38,364 --> 00:57:39,589
So why'd you let your team go?

655
00:57:42,611 --> 00:57:45,497
If you stick around long enough
you're gonna buy it. It was time.

656
00:57:45,532 --> 00:57:47,747
They didn't seem too happy about it.

657
00:57:48,621 --> 00:57:51,154
If you're looking to go the family route,

658
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,518
it's the wrong job for you.

659
00:57:55,553 --> 00:57:58,722
There are different kinds of family.

660
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:02,160
And when my life is on the line.

661
00:58:03,175 --> 00:58:04,698
That's my family fighting with me.

662
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:13,096
You know what I mean.

663
00:58:13,131 --> 00:58:15,521
Yeah, I know what you mean.

664
00:58:31,413 --> 00:58:32,863
Right on time.

665
00:58:37,221 --> 00:58:38,316
Ladies first.

666
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:39,727
Go ahead then, Thorn.

667
00:58:39,762 --> 00:58:41,282
Will you shut up and get in the sewer.

668
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,810
And ladies and gentlemen, we
officially have eyes in the sky.

669
00:59:57,845 --> 00:59:58,820
Copy that.

670
00:59:58,855 --> 00:59:59,627
Let's do this.

671
01:00:00,262 --> 01:00:01,468
Thought you'd never ask.

672
01:00:42,592 --> 01:00:43,192
Good to go.

673
01:00:45,638 --> 01:00:46,238
Good luck boys.

674
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:07,950
Woah! Shit!

675
01:01:08,228 --> 01:01:08,988
What's the problem?

676
01:01:09,003 --> 01:01:10,859
The buyer, they're early.

677
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:12,416
Threat just doubled.

678
01:01:27,829 --> 01:01:28,813
You're early.

679
01:01:30,189 --> 01:01:32,054
What do you think?

680
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,222
It's OK.

681
01:01:45,174 --> 01:01:46,561
When Cain slew his brother.

682
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:49,797
God banished him from civilization.

683
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:52,289
But before that he placed a mark on him.

684
01:01:54,007 --> 01:01:55,642
It was a felon's brand, but...

685
01:01:56,693 --> 01:01:59,119
to protect him from roving hunters.

686
01:02:01,655 --> 01:02:03,155
Customs does not X-ray artwork.

687
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,100
It ruins the oils.

688
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:06,300
Very good.

689
01:02:09,204 --> 01:02:10,324
There you have it.

690
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:11,590
Gabil.

691
01:02:12,621 --> 01:02:13,254
My pleasure.

692
01:02:13,289 --> 01:02:14,024
As always.

693
01:02:16,756 --> 01:02:21,152
Can you access nuclear weapons?

694
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,000
I might.

695
01:02:27,942 --> 01:02:31,460
But generally I find people are a
little too emotional for ownership.

696
01:02:32,694 --> 01:02:35,225
And I'd hate you killing all my
other customers by accident.

697
01:02:35,923 --> 01:02:37,083
Or on purpose.

698
01:02:39,441 --> 01:02:40,611
In position.

699
01:02:42,911 --> 01:02:44,003
In position.

700
01:02:44,669 --> 01:02:45,551
Set.

701
01:02:45,586 --> 01:02:46,991
I pay you what you want.

702
01:02:48,278 --> 01:02:49,158
Let me think about it.

703
01:02:52,399 --> 01:02:53,454
We're on.

704
01:03:09,975 --> 01:03:11,414
Stonebanks is moving, watch it.

705
01:03:15,493 --> 01:03:17,672
Like little mice...

706
01:03:24,308 --> 01:03:25,289
Try again.

707
01:03:26,839 --> 01:03:28,703
Open sesame.

708
01:03:31,233 --> 01:03:32,182
Go go go.

709
01:03:34,114 --> 01:03:35,567
Move.

710
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,319
Go.

711
01:03:51,701 --> 01:03:52,973
Barney Ross says hello.

712
01:04:01,043 --> 01:04:02,134
Nice job.

713
01:04:05,173 --> 01:04:06,536
Trench, you copy?

714
01:04:07,968 --> 01:04:08,673
I'm waiting.

715
01:04:09,408 --> 01:04:10,960
Package is secured.

716
01:04:10,995 --> 01:04:12,443
Hurry up.

717
01:04:12,478 --> 01:04:13,391
It's boring.

718
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,320
Why don't you just a bullet in
his head and be done with it.

719
01:04:36,449 --> 01:04:37,889
Hey, you said we were taking him in.

720
01:04:40,947 --> 01:04:41,685
Good morning.

721
01:04:46,855 --> 01:04:48,784
Are these your students?

722
01:04:48,819 --> 01:04:51,052
Hey kids, what'd you learn tonight huh?

723
01:04:52,181 --> 01:04:53,737
What happened to the old crew?

724
01:04:53,772 --> 01:04:55,633
Oh that's right.

725
01:04:55,668 --> 01:04:59,672
They stuck their noses into other
people's worlds and got fatally injured.

726
01:05:00,207 --> 01:05:02,599
Now they're The Deletables.

727
01:05:02,634 --> 01:05:04,667
Hey, you hear that kids?

728
01:05:04,702 --> 01:05:06,702
Take note cause that's what
you're doing right now.

729
01:05:07,412 --> 01:05:08,669
Let me shut his mouth.

730
01:05:09,004 --> 01:05:12,263
You're talking pretty tough to a guy who's
incapacitated, which is good for you.

731
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:12,497
Is it?

732
01:05:12,498 --> 01:05:16,604
Why don't you cut me loose and I'll open your
meat shirt and show you your own heart.

733
01:05:18,718 --> 01:05:20,096
Hey Barney.

734
01:05:21,675 --> 01:05:24,241
Why don't the two of us just end this?
What do you say?

735
01:05:24,276 --> 01:05:28,709
Mix it up, either you snapping
my spine or me snapping yours.

736
01:05:28,744 --> 01:05:30,607
You know, make it snappy.

737
01:05:32,263 --> 01:05:33,884
He thinks I'm joking.
I'm not joking.

738
01:05:33,919 --> 01:05:35,461
You should see me when I'm angry.

739
01:05:35,596 --> 01:05:37,167
You'd be very impressed.

740
01:05:37,202 --> 01:05:38,761
And very dead.

741
01:05:40,761 --> 01:05:41,427
So, come on pal.

742
01:05:41,462 --> 01:05:44,226
Anything you want to get off your chest.

743
01:05:46,505 --> 01:05:47,403
Come on, lay it out.

744
01:05:47,438 --> 01:05:48,912
I'm a good listener.

745
01:05:51,792 --> 01:05:53,934
You're gonna take me back to the has been crew?

746
01:05:53,969 --> 01:05:55,581
Carve me up around a fire.

747
01:05:55,616 --> 01:05:57,235
Very tribal.

748
01:06:03,144 --> 01:06:04,684
When we stop, I wanna break every bone in your body.

749
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:07,627
And drop what's left at The Hague.

750
01:06:08,462 --> 01:06:13,496
The Hague. I finally made the big-time.

751
01:06:13,531 --> 01:06:15,399
I'm a war criminal.

752
01:06:15,434 --> 01:06:16,482
Keep laughing.

753
01:06:18,626 --> 01:06:20,425
Do you think,

754
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:23,659
that you can just deliver me like a package?

755
01:06:29,771 --> 01:06:31,697
We were close once.

756
01:06:31,732 --> 01:06:34,114
See we started this whole
Expendables thing together, see?

757
01:06:34,149 --> 01:06:35,726
Look I've got the marks.

758
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:40,952
They're a bit faded but, we had a falling out.

759
01:06:40,987 --> 01:06:42,105
You went dark.

760
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:45,367
It's a dark business Barney,
don't pretend you're not in it.

761
01:06:45,402 --> 01:06:48,746
The baddest survive, those are
the rules, I didn't make them up.

762
01:06:49,668 --> 01:06:52,793
You see Barney here was content
to work for the small end money.

763
01:06:52,828 --> 01:06:54,239
As an employee.

764
01:06:54,274 --> 01:06:58,346
Now being boss is more lucrative but that's
a concept that somehow eluded you.

765
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:01,369
Plus you got that pesky moral conscience.

766
01:07:01,404 --> 01:07:03,329
God that stuff gets in the way.

767
01:07:03,364 --> 01:07:04,701
He thinks he's the good guy.

768
01:07:04,736 --> 01:07:05,816
Keep talking while you can.

769
01:07:06,179 --> 01:07:08,666
Sure, you got a conscience that makes you weak.

770
01:07:08,701 --> 01:07:10,916
Success, real success...

771
01:07:10,951 --> 01:07:13,902
is being willing to do the things
that other people are not.

772
01:07:13,937 --> 01:07:15,916
Not everyone's as sick as you.

773
01:07:15,951 --> 01:07:17,957
Oh, but you are.

774
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:20,283
Did you kill anyone today Barne?

775
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:22,332
Blow any shit up?

776
01:07:22,367 --> 01:07:24,638
How bout you kids? Kill anyone?

777
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:29,034
Before you all start grabbing bricks
to stone me at The Hague.

778
01:07:29,069 --> 01:07:32,459
You might want to check your own hands for blood.

779
01:07:34,874 --> 01:07:36,700
But I digress. Where was I?

780
01:07:36,735 --> 01:07:38,802
Yes, business is booming right?

781
01:07:38,837 --> 01:07:41,371
A chopper here, a missile there, guns.

782
01:07:41,406 --> 01:07:43,543
Whatever, when suddenly

783
01:07:43,578 --> 01:07:44,634
a competitor.

784
01:07:44,669 --> 01:07:46,676
If you can call Uncle Sam a competitor.

785
01:07:46,711 --> 01:07:50,714
Hires my own team. Barney and
the whole gang to whack me.

786
01:07:50,749 --> 01:07:54,294
Things got ugly real fast and a lot of people got dead.

787
01:07:54,329 --> 01:07:56,004
Three former brothers in arms.

788
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:58,121
- Shut your mouth.
- Three Expendables.

789
01:07:58,156 --> 01:08:00,650
Our brothers, men we ate with,
fought with, bled with, dead!

790
01:08:01,185 --> 01:08:03,506
He puts three slugs into my chest.
Thank God...

791
01:08:03,531 --> 01:08:05,696
for body armor, even I thought I was dead.

792
01:08:06,607 --> 01:08:09,341
And then he boogies out with the casualties, all dead!

793
01:08:09,366 --> 01:08:11,627
Because you couldn't
stay out of my business!

794
01:08:11,662 --> 01:08:13,882
Shut your mouth!

795
01:08:13,917 --> 01:08:15,438
Go on, do it!

796
01:08:15,473 --> 01:08:16,633
- Go on!
- It's what he wants.

797
01:08:32,493 --> 01:08:33,715
It's hard to fathom.

798
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:35,242
I can't believe you forgot.

799
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:36,408
What?

800
01:08:36,443 --> 01:08:39,978
That it's hard to beat an enemy when
he's living inside your own head.

801
01:08:40,013 --> 01:08:43,076
You see you tie me up.

802
01:08:43,111 --> 01:08:44,523
Like an animal.

803
01:08:44,558 --> 01:08:47,370
Leave me to the slaughter.
You humiliate me. Disgrace me.

804
01:08:47,405 --> 01:08:49,797
Now when the time comes to kill you.

805
01:08:49,832 --> 01:08:53,277
And it will. I will not use a weapon.
I will use my hands.

806
01:08:53,312 --> 01:08:56,263
Because I want you to feel the
way that I feel right now...

807
01:08:59,989 --> 01:09:00,909
cause we were brothers.

808
01:09:06,705 --> 01:09:07,256
What's that?

809
01:09:07,291 --> 01:09:10,244
It's a GPS tracker.

810
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:11,479
How about that?

811
01:10:32,942 --> 01:10:33,828
Hold it.

812
01:10:35,618 --> 01:10:36,348
We may need them.

813
01:10:37,648 --> 01:10:38,945
I need a body, find him.

814
01:12:02,589 --> 01:12:04,189
What happened?

815
01:12:04,190 --> 01:12:05,626
We found a shitstorm.

816
01:12:07,711 --> 01:12:08,711
It's gonna getting worse.

817
01:12:08,939 --> 01:12:11,772
This came in for you, 10 minutes ago.

818
01:12:15,253 --> 01:12:17,043
Hey Barney.

819
01:12:17,078 --> 01:12:19,996
My search party's dead so
I'm taking it you're still with us.

820
01:12:20,031 --> 01:12:22,179
Now you should've killed
me when you had the chance

821
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:24,038
cause that's your last
window, and it's gone.

822
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:26,183
Now, I got something to show you here.

823
01:12:26,184 --> 01:12:31,184
Lida, Harpo, Groucho, Gummo, and Chica.

824
01:12:31,885 --> 01:12:33,085
Yeah yeah yeah.

825
01:12:33,086 --> 01:12:35,086
Hey, give her a little squeeze, there.

826
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:42,087
Personally, I'd chalk it up to collateral
damage, but I don't give a fuck.

827
01:12:42,488 --> 01:12:44,488
But, I know you.

828
01:12:46,307 --> 01:12:49,569
- 48 hours and they're gone for good.
- You want them?

829
01:12:49,604 --> 01:12:50,910
Come get them.

830
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:53,123
What are you gonna do?

831
01:13:21,979 --> 01:13:24,446
Wow, looking a little strung out there kids.

832
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:29,562
This is what you get for being pawns
in Barney's moral chess game.

833
01:13:30,966 --> 01:13:32,232
That one looks a little slack.

834
01:13:38,594 --> 01:13:40,344
You know I feel most bad for you.

835
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:42,628
I don't give a shit how you feel.

836
01:13:42,663 --> 01:13:44,595
I do, I have a daughter.

837
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:46,638
I have feelings, anyway.

838
01:13:46,673 --> 01:13:50,108
You know, when the CIA, I, er
presume that's who you're working for.

839
01:13:50,143 --> 01:13:51,954
The CIA, am I right?

840
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:56,000
I bet you don't even know who you're working for.

841
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,200
But for Barney?

842
01:13:58,243 --> 01:14:00,449
Do you know who he's working for?

843
01:14:02,275 --> 01:14:03,601
Does he know who he's working... I...

844
01:14:03,636 --> 01:14:04,836
It gets very confusing.

845
01:14:05,227 --> 01:14:08,707
Anyway, when the CIA wanted
guys doing the dangerous work...

846
01:14:08,742 --> 01:14:10,042
in the dangerous places...

847
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,700
they called us. When they didn't
want to get their hands dirty...

848
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,506
they called us.

849
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Yup, we cleared every hotspot they had.

850
01:14:18,001 --> 01:14:22,401
We bumped the bad guys so that the
good guys could roll in looking like heroes.

851
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:28,975
We killed a lot.

852
01:14:30,193 --> 01:14:32,021
But we saved more lives...

853
01:14:32,056 --> 01:14:36,584
than you can possibly imagine.

854
01:14:36,619 --> 01:14:40,401
Then the boys on the hill
wanting no loose ends.

855
01:14:41,054 --> 01:14:42,362
Tried to bury me.

856
01:14:43,803 --> 01:14:45,171
I was an American.

857
01:14:45,206 --> 01:14:46,904
Working for America.

858
01:14:48,062 --> 01:14:48,749
Was.

859
01:14:50,816 --> 01:14:52,336
They'd eat their own children.

860
01:14:54,336 --> 01:14:55,550
The lesson here is...

861
01:14:56,736 --> 01:14:59,900
Never do business with the government.

862
01:15:02,076 --> 01:15:03,653
I'm gonna save you that heartache.

863
01:15:05,204 --> 01:15:05,804
You never will.

864
01:15:19,733 --> 01:15:20,964
So you're getting your old team?

865
01:15:20,999 --> 01:15:22,192
Nah, I've burned that bridge.

866
01:15:22,227 --> 01:15:24,472
You know your pride is gonna get you killed.

867
01:15:24,507 --> 01:15:25,527
Better me than them.

868
01:15:26,838 --> 01:15:28,461
- So you're really gonna go back?
- Yeah.

869
01:15:28,496 --> 01:15:29,938
- Alone?
- Yeah.

870
01:15:31,066 --> 01:15:32,157
You're an idiot.

871
01:15:32,756 --> 01:15:34,127
Thanks for showing up.

872
01:15:35,604 --> 01:15:37,121
I guess our favors are done.

873
01:15:41,159 --> 01:15:42,884
But you're still an idiot.

874
01:16:11,008 --> 01:16:12,168
How the hell did you find me?

875
01:16:13,657 --> 01:16:15,024
People talk.

876
01:16:15,059 --> 01:16:15,933
I hear things.

877
01:16:15,968 --> 01:16:17,726
You got a mission...

878
01:16:17,761 --> 01:16:19,273
I can help.

879
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:21,902
My name is Galgo.

880
01:16:21,937 --> 01:16:23,582
Let me fill you in.

881
01:16:23,617 --> 01:16:25,978
I am good, very good.

882
01:16:26,013 --> 01:16:27,277
At warfare.

883
01:16:27,312 --> 01:16:29,422
You know good memory, afraid of nothing.

884
01:16:29,457 --> 01:16:32,271
I want to be your friend.

885
01:16:32,306 --> 01:16:33,920
I don't need a friend.

886
01:16:34,972 --> 01:16:36,245
Yes, you do.

887
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:38,211
Everybody does.

888
01:16:38,246 --> 01:16:42,818
I don't have any friends
That's why I know.

889
01:16:42,853 --> 01:16:45,317
Besides my friendship issues,

890
01:16:45,352 --> 01:16:47,988
what I really need now is something to do.

891
01:16:48,023 --> 01:16:50,593
Well, not just anything but...

892
01:16:51,757 --> 01:16:53,306
what I was born to do.

893
01:16:53,341 --> 01:16:55,139
Best bet, this is a one way trip.

894
01:16:55,174 --> 01:16:56,996
Excuse me sir, but...

895
01:16:57,031 --> 01:16:59,107
one way trip...

896
01:16:59,142 --> 01:17:00,613
is better than no way...

897
01:17:00,748 --> 01:17:02,654
which is the way I live now.

898
01:17:10,365 --> 01:17:11,285
Help me with the crate.

899
01:17:13,857 --> 01:17:15,228
I'm sorry.

900
01:17:17,526 --> 01:17:19,095
On the plane, Gogo.

901
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:22,498
On the plane, yes. But Gogo no Gogo, Galgo.

902
01:17:23,692 --> 01:17:25,492
- Galgo.
- Gogo sounds like a Parisian hooker.

903
01:17:38,777 --> 01:17:40,845
I am the bridegroom of death.

904
01:17:41,616 --> 01:17:44,468
The lyrics of a Spanish legion old songs.

905
01:17:44,503 --> 01:17:46,582
That we used to sing when
we're on a mission in Croatia.

906
01:17:46,617 --> 01:17:49,042
That's where I met Mingo.

907
01:17:50,206 --> 01:17:52,131
The best point man ever.

908
01:17:53,425 --> 01:17:55,225
Some kind of savant. You don't know

909
01:17:55,249 --> 01:17:57,292
ambush this guy couldn't sniff. And under fire...

910
01:17:57,627 --> 01:17:59,246
the coolest cat ever.

911
01:17:59,281 --> 01:18:01,281
Just pure ice in his veins.

912
01:18:01,286 --> 01:18:04,086
We were pinned down once like two bullets left.

913
01:18:04,556 --> 01:18:05,615
I looked over...

914
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:07,850
Not one bead of sweat.

915
01:18:12,953 --> 01:18:14,199
Yeah.

916
01:18:14,234 --> 01:18:15,890
Can I help you up there?

917
01:18:15,925 --> 01:18:17,435
You're a mechanic now?

918
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:20,429
Of course I am a mechanic.
I am whatever you need me to be, sir.

919
01:18:20,464 --> 01:18:22,295
OK. Then just be quiet.

920
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:23,843
Yes, sir.

921
01:18:23,878 --> 01:18:24,785
Tiger,

922
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:26,327
This sniper I knew.

923
01:18:26,362 --> 01:18:28,046
I mean, this guy got it all figured out.

924
01:18:28,081 --> 01:18:30,261
Wind speed, temperature...

925
01:18:30,296 --> 01:18:33,004
Barometric pressure.

926
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:35,466
But you know what he said was the most important?

927
01:18:35,501 --> 01:18:36,412
No.

928
01:18:36,447 --> 01:18:37,640
Patience.

929
01:18:37,675 --> 01:18:39,116
Really?

930
01:18:39,151 --> 01:18:40,274
Yes, he said that.

931
01:18:40,309 --> 01:18:44,990
This thing smells good, what is that?
Kerosene? Gasoline?

932
01:18:45,025 --> 01:18:45,925
Aviation fuel.

933
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:47,300
Aviation fuel.

934
01:18:48,685 --> 01:18:50,374
It's good.

935
01:18:52,539 --> 01:18:56,469
The best team member ever, his name was Torres.

936
01:18:56,504 --> 01:18:57,814
Holy shit!

937
01:18:57,849 --> 01:19:00,066
You wouldn't believe what this guy was capable to do.

938
01:19:00,101 --> 01:19:01,605
Un...bel...ievable.

939
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:03,154
I'm telling you, man.

940
01:19:03,189 --> 01:19:03,949
- Galgo?
- Yes, sir.

941
01:19:04,101 --> 01:19:06,030
I think I know why your team let you go.

942
01:19:08,514 --> 01:19:09,244
You do?

943
01:19:09,279 --> 01:19:11,105
Really?

944
01:19:14,001 --> 01:19:14,664
Yes.

945
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:26,042
Last chance.

946
01:19:26,077 --> 01:19:27,633
You sure you want to do this?

947
01:19:29,319 --> 01:19:30,544
I like traveling.

948
01:19:30,579 --> 01:19:31,495
Good.

949
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:48,098
Uh, who are those guys?

950
01:19:48,133 --> 01:19:49,539
My old team.

951
01:20:00,358 --> 01:20:01,678
What the hell are you doing here?

952
01:20:03,036 --> 01:20:05,686
You were stupid enough to
get yourself into this mess.

953
01:20:06,337 --> 01:20:08,673
We're the only ones crazy
enough to get you out of it.

954
01:20:12,004 --> 01:20:12,752
Come on.

955
01:20:12,787 --> 01:20:14,159
We're late for a war.

956
01:20:22,242 --> 01:20:25,261
Galgo you might want to get out
of that seat, Christmas is coming.

957
01:20:25,999 --> 01:20:27,021
But it's June.

958
01:20:27,056 --> 01:20:28,883
Galgo, get the hell out.

959
01:20:28,918 --> 01:20:30,707
Yes, sir.

960
01:20:32,078 --> 01:20:33,872
My hat.

961
01:20:42,060 --> 01:20:42,686
I'm curious.

962
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:43,200
What?

963
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:45,250
Since when did suicide become your hobby?

964
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:46,741
I got a will.

965
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,685
You know I'm probably the
only friend you've got.

966
01:20:49,722 --> 01:20:50,925
I got lots of friends.

967
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:53,075
You walk into a room,
people jump on the tables.

968
01:20:55,641 --> 01:20:57,050
I missed you, Christmas.

969
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:59,098
I miss you too, you demented bastard.

970
01:20:59,133 --> 01:21:00,648
You could've left it demented.

971
01:21:02,611 --> 01:21:05,111
It's a kind of a solid structure

972
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,550
that is taking us from one place to another

973
01:21:07,639 --> 01:21:08,939
through unbelievable speeds.

974
01:21:09,116 --> 01:21:10,026
Think about it.

975
01:21:10,061 --> 01:21:14,761
If God... if God... if he
would've liked us you know flying.

976
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,300
He would've given us feathers.

977
01:21:17,373 --> 01:21:18,949
Do you have feathers?

978
01:21:18,984 --> 01:21:20,000
Do you have feathers?

979
01:21:20,035 --> 01:21:23,126
- I don't have feathers.
- It's gonna be a long ass flight fellas.

980
01:21:23,161 --> 01:21:24,355
It's going to be.

981
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:26,852
It's going to be a long flight but don't worry...

982
01:21:26,887 --> 01:21:30,193
I'm here, because I can't sleep on planes...

983
01:21:31,534 --> 01:21:32,168
Yeah.

984
01:21:32,203 --> 01:21:34,723
Thought you should know Barney,
you're walking into a shitstorm.

985
01:21:34,732 --> 01:21:38,560
NSA ran a signals and frequencies
check on your team's phones.

986
01:21:38,595 --> 01:21:41,003
This bastard's not even trying to hide them.

987
01:21:41,038 --> 01:21:41,811
Where has he taken them?

988
01:21:41,846 --> 01:21:43,250
They're in Azmanastan.

989
01:21:43,285 --> 01:21:45,040
Another honeymoon hotspot.

990
01:21:45,415 --> 01:21:46,231
Who is that?

991
01:21:46,266 --> 01:21:47,641
Lee Christmas.

992
01:21:47,676 --> 01:21:49,612
Not far off, Christmas.

993
01:21:49,647 --> 01:21:52,426
Stonebanks's compound is where he trains his goons.

994
01:21:52,461 --> 01:21:54,681
It's very heavily fortified.

995
01:21:54,716 --> 01:21:56,118
What's up with the local army?

996
01:21:56,153 --> 01:21:58,284
I don't understand a word this guy is saying.

997
01:21:58,319 --> 01:21:59,622
Local army status.

998
01:22:00,257 --> 01:22:01,659
Small, corrupt.

999
01:22:02,394 --> 01:22:05,589
Stonebanks got all the brass in his pocket.

1000
01:22:05,624 --> 01:22:09,105
Been running his operations through
this shithole of a country for years.

1001
01:22:09,140 --> 01:22:10,240
Want some advice?

1002
01:22:10,245 --> 01:22:13,570
- What's the advice?
- What goddamn language is that?

1003
01:22:13,704 --> 01:22:15,404
They don't teach you
that on the stage either.

1004
01:22:15,405 --> 01:22:16,540
Look who's talking.

1005
01:22:16,575 --> 01:22:18,051
What's the advice Drummer?

1006
01:22:18,086 --> 01:22:19,627
Forget about what you're thinking.

1007
01:22:19,662 --> 01:22:20,961
Remember our deal.

1008
01:22:20,996 --> 01:22:22,223
We need him alive.

1009
01:22:22,258 --> 01:22:25,275
So he can sit in a courtroom
and beat this on a technicality?

1010
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:27,683
Those are orders, Barney.

1011
01:22:29,029 --> 01:22:30,714
- You broke the phone.
- I got another one.

1012
01:22:33,846 --> 01:22:35,291
Think we'll make it back from this one?

1013
01:22:35,326 --> 01:22:37,037
You didn't have to come along, Christmas.

1014
01:22:37,072 --> 01:22:38,938
Sure I did.

1015
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,539
Morons need friends.

1016
01:22:49,113 --> 01:22:49,992
Gentlemen.

1017
01:22:50,027 --> 01:22:51,225
Change of plans.

1018
01:23:08,486 --> 01:23:09,215
This is it?

1019
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,727
This is your evac team?

1020
01:23:10,938 --> 01:23:11,922
Short notice.

1021
01:23:11,957 --> 01:23:13,119
Yeah.

1022
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:14,101
Very short.

1023
01:23:14,136 --> 01:23:16,040
Where is your team?

1024
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:17,623
Major Drummer?

1025
01:23:17,658 --> 01:23:19,737
No team, this one's off the books.

1026
01:23:20,971 --> 01:23:22,236
I'm not even here.

1027
01:23:23,892 --> 01:23:24,764
Nobody's here.

1028
01:23:26,674 --> 01:23:28,213
I thought Church was asshole.

1029
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:43,400
Yeah, hysterical is strength. Weird.
Yes, a weird concept.

1030
01:23:43,743 --> 01:23:46,595
I mean, if you're hysterically strong...

1031
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:48,208
you don't even have to go to the gym.

1032
01:23:48,243 --> 01:23:51,130
You are just strong. You just got it.
You just got it.

1033
01:23:51,165 --> 01:23:54,988
Hysterical was a concept that
actually was applied to women...

1034
01:23:55,023 --> 01:23:58,115
in the 19th century.
It's a 'dosimonenic' concept.

1035
01:23:58,150 --> 01:23:59,870
You know what I mean.

1036
01:23:59,905 --> 01:24:02,508
Well, this is an interesting place...

1037
01:24:02,543 --> 01:24:03,444
He gave me a migraine.

1038
01:24:03,579 --> 01:24:04,617
I hear that.

1039
01:24:04,952 --> 01:24:05,676
Don't you think?

1040
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:08,003
Look on the bright side.

1041
01:24:08,038 --> 01:24:10,468
You run out of bullets,
you can talk him to death.

1042
01:24:10,503 --> 01:24:11,772
Roger that.

1043
01:24:13,047 --> 01:24:14,133
Tall one doesn't like me.

1044
01:24:14,168 --> 01:24:15,228
He doesn't like anybody.

1045
01:24:15,263 --> 01:24:16,596
- What you say?
- He likes you.

1046
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:29,099
What the hell is that?

1047
01:24:29,771 --> 01:24:30,964
What?

1048
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:32,507
That computer strapped to your wrist.

1049
01:24:32,542 --> 01:24:34,096
Nothing.

1050
01:24:34,097 --> 01:24:36,591
The same thing you were
busting that kid's balls about.

1051
01:24:36,626 --> 01:24:38,147
Nah, I had it for a while now.

1052
01:24:49,621 --> 01:24:51,238
Why'd your team let you go?

1053
01:24:55,264 --> 01:24:56,292
Why is it matter now?

1054
01:24:56,327 --> 01:24:57,839
I want to know who I'm working with.

1055
01:25:02,371 --> 01:25:03,623
They are not around anymore.

1056
01:25:08,005 --> 01:25:08,660
So...

1057
01:25:10,137 --> 01:25:11,261
This um,

1058
01:25:15,237 --> 01:25:16,158
So why'd they let you go?

1059
01:25:16,193 --> 01:25:18,054
They didn't.

1060
01:25:28,506 --> 01:25:30,363
Benghazi.

1061
01:25:30,398 --> 01:25:34,285
I was not in the army anymore. We were...

1062
01:25:35,146 --> 01:25:37,746
retrieving a hostage something like uh...

1063
01:25:39,008 --> 01:25:41,086
like what we are doing here.

1064
01:25:43,443 --> 01:25:46,401
It was a beautiful day.

1065
01:25:47,428 --> 01:25:49,760
No problems.

1066
01:25:49,795 --> 01:25:52,679
And then it all went bad.

1067
01:25:54,467 --> 01:25:56,185
We got hit, cut off...

1068
01:25:57,313 --> 01:25:59,601
Waited for support, no one came.

1069
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:08,738
Everybody died.

1070
01:26:11,331 --> 01:26:12,665
Except me.

1071
01:26:14,183 --> 01:26:15,027
Galgo...

1072
01:26:16,046 --> 01:26:17,944
Torres and Tiger were right.

1073
01:26:22,167 --> 01:26:23,960
You were listening.

1074
01:26:23,995 --> 01:26:26,083
Yeah, I was listening.

1075
01:26:28,711 --> 01:26:29,938
Thank you.

1076
01:27:08,952 --> 01:27:10,250
So what do you think?

1077
01:27:11,596 --> 01:27:14,014
I think we should get this over with.

1078
01:27:43,729 --> 01:27:45,105
Four signals.

1079
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:47,255
Eight stories up.

1080
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:48,867
This is way too wrong.

1081
01:27:49,886 --> 01:27:51,046
Sally don't like it.

1082
01:27:51,081 --> 01:27:53,044
You know he's got eyes on us now.

1083
01:27:53,079 --> 01:27:56,632
- May I suggest something?
- No. No, later.

1084
01:27:56,667 --> 01:27:57,940
That's what I thought.

1085
01:27:57,975 --> 01:27:59,378
That's fine.

1086
01:29:05,244 --> 01:29:05,844
Go.

1087
01:29:38,198 --> 01:29:38,909
Break it.

1088
01:29:47,412 --> 01:29:48,355
What the hell!

1089
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:52,356
Hello, Barney.

1090
01:29:55,106 --> 01:29:56,306
I knew you couldn't stay away.

1091
01:29:57,117 --> 01:29:59,197
But I'm relieved that someone
could pick up the kids.

1092
01:30:00,106 --> 01:30:03,163
You got them in there,
now try getting them out.

1093
01:30:04,392 --> 01:30:05,608
But unfortunately for you...

1094
01:30:06,043 --> 01:30:09,233
The entire complex has been wired with C-4.

1095
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:15,273
It'd take a regular Joe about 90 seconds to
get out of there. You got, how about 45?

1096
01:30:29,339 --> 01:30:31,062
He's turned this whole place into a bomb.

1097
01:30:33,947 --> 01:30:35,065
Maybe not.

1098
01:30:35,866 --> 01:30:36,866
Hey!

1099
01:30:40,541 --> 01:30:42,409
9% battery power? You didn't charge it?

1100
01:30:42,444 --> 01:30:44,806
Excuse me but what are you doing?

1101
01:30:44,841 --> 01:30:47,333
Try to run some code, should be able to jam the signal.

1102
01:30:47,368 --> 01:30:48,308
Why didn't you think of that?

1103
01:30:48,343 --> 01:30:49,755
Well I use it to check the weather.

1104
01:30:49,790 --> 01:30:51,408
Will you just shut up and let him do his thing?

1105
01:30:51,443 --> 01:30:52,519
You sure you're gonna do this Thorn?

1106
01:30:52,554 --> 01:30:53,885
I can do it, I can do it.

1107
01:30:59,552 --> 01:31:01,662
Come on, man.

1108
01:31:01,797 --> 01:31:02,848
Come on, man.

1109
01:31:02,883 --> 01:31:04,150
Come on, come on.

1110
01:31:04,185 --> 01:31:06,357
Come on, Thorn.

1111
01:31:06,392 --> 01:31:07,764
Come on.

1112
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:11,678
You're good, come on Thorn.

1113
01:31:13,998 --> 01:31:15,157
Focus, focus.

1114
01:31:15,192 --> 01:31:17,268
Got it.

1115
01:31:17,303 --> 01:31:19,867
Good job, my boy.

1116
01:31:24,895 --> 01:31:27,072
We lost override. The signal is jammed.

1117
01:31:27,107 --> 01:31:28,786
Send them in.

1118
01:31:31,512 --> 01:31:34,469
Barney the battery's at 8%.
When this thing dies, we lose override.

1119
01:31:34,504 --> 01:31:36,509
That gives us about 25 minutes tops.

1120
01:31:39,948 --> 01:31:42,192
Don't pop the bottles yet, we still got trouble.

1121
01:31:42,227 --> 01:31:44,161
- What?
- Big trouble.

1122
01:31:58,158 --> 01:31:59,134
Lucky again bro.

1123
01:31:59,169 --> 01:32:02,606
Try to enjoy the view because shortly the
building that you're currently standing in

1124
01:32:03,141 --> 01:32:05,644
will be surrounded by the Azmanastan army.

1125
01:32:07,592 --> 01:32:10,512
- How did you shitheads manage to get captured anyway?
- Shut the fuck up!

1126
01:32:17,437 --> 01:32:18,604
Step back.

1127
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:23,836
This is not an accident.
And we're trapped in here.

1128
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:27,146
This is exactly what he knew would happen.

1129
01:32:27,181 --> 01:32:29,755
Us, tearing at each other.

1130
01:32:30,746 --> 01:32:32,369
This stops now.

1131
01:32:33,989 --> 01:32:34,652
We can do this.

1132
01:32:35,877 --> 01:32:38,515
But only if we do this together.

1133
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:41,145
If we work as a team.

1134
01:32:42,895 --> 01:32:44,864
We just may get out of this alive.

1135
01:32:47,191 --> 01:32:50,634
Now do you, want to make it work.

1136
01:32:52,041 --> 01:32:52,965
That simple.

1137
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,856
You got any weapons?

1138
01:32:54,891 --> 01:32:57,920
Here's the plan. We're gonna
break up into small groups.

1139
01:32:57,955 --> 01:32:59,539
And go out through the ground floor.

1140
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:00,174
Get ready.

1141
01:33:00,455 --> 01:33:01,365
Come on.

1142
01:33:24,877 --> 01:33:27,399
- Thorn, you stay with me.
- You take Galgo.

1143
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:28,390
Yeah I don't want to.

1144
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:30,400
What, what? Shhh...

1145
01:33:47,975 --> 01:33:49,129
Don't stop!

1146
01:33:49,164 --> 01:33:50,640
One there, one there.

1147
01:34:03,587 --> 01:34:04,672
There's too many!

1148
01:34:04,707 --> 01:34:06,629
They're on our flank. Bring it to 'em.

1149
01:34:24,498 --> 01:34:26,145
That's enough, light them up.

1150
01:34:33,037 --> 01:34:33,885
Incoming.

1151
01:34:43,937 --> 01:34:46,228
Up the shaft Thorn.
You gotta protect that signal jammer.

1152
01:35:04,929 --> 01:35:06,090
I thought you could fight.

1153
01:35:55,860 --> 01:35:57,666
Jesus God, you're OK?

1154
01:35:57,701 --> 01:35:58,994
Do not worry. I love this.

1155
01:35:59,029 --> 01:36:00,621
Good keep moving.

1156
01:36:49,195 --> 01:36:50,701
Relax.

1157
01:36:50,736 --> 01:36:53,121
I told you you'd give yourself a stroke.

1158
01:36:54,454 --> 01:36:56,172
You got a tank problem pal.

1159
01:36:56,207 --> 01:36:57,504
Do something about it.

1160
01:36:57,539 --> 01:36:58,421
I'm on it.

1161
01:37:01,266 --> 01:37:02,146
Trench, on your right.

1162
01:37:08,112 --> 01:37:08,832
That's gotta hurt.

1163
01:37:13,432 --> 01:37:15,080
Drummer's in the house.

1164
01:37:39,796 --> 01:37:40,451
Let's go.

1165
01:37:42,354 --> 01:37:44,323
Time to pick up the tempo boys.

1166
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:55,501
Look out for the chopper.

1167
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:56,735
Not good.

1168
01:37:56,770 --> 01:37:58,533
Hold on.

1169
01:38:20,368 --> 01:38:22,020
This is not happening.

1170
01:38:22,055 --> 01:38:23,112
You want to do something?

1171
01:38:51,274 --> 01:38:53,202
Put me down! Put me down!

1172
01:38:54,316 --> 01:38:55,294
Oh shit!

1173
01:39:05,877 --> 01:39:06,676
Hi there.

1174
01:39:14,970 --> 01:39:16,563
Closer.

1175
01:39:16,598 --> 01:39:18,924
Closer.

1176
01:39:22,577 --> 01:39:23,949
Yang, hit something.

1177
01:39:30,173 --> 01:39:31,159
Next.

1178
01:39:38,234 --> 01:39:39,499
Your name is Luna right?

1179
01:39:39,534 --> 01:39:41,965
Luna means moon.

1180
01:39:43,161 --> 01:39:45,688
Hypnotic, mysterious, magical, like yourself.

1181
01:39:50,156 --> 01:39:52,551
Would you like to hold my gun?

1182
01:39:54,174 --> 01:39:55,510
Goodbye, sweet.

1183
01:40:01,187 --> 01:40:02,661
There he is!

1184
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:20,800
Come on, drive this thing.

1185
01:40:29,671 --> 01:40:31,211
This one's for Caesar, assholes.

1186
01:40:34,112 --> 01:40:34,670
Yeah!

1187
01:40:34,705 --> 01:40:36,258
Damn that's cool.

1188
01:40:47,164 --> 01:40:48,925
It was all under control.

1189
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,089
That's what it looked like.

1190
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:04,490
Come on!

1191
01:42:13,694 --> 01:42:15,910
This the happiest moment of my life.

1192
01:42:33,645 --> 01:42:34,939
Jingling jingling.

1193
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:40,518
You finished here?

1194
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:05,642
Men!

1195
01:43:08,016 --> 01:43:09,982
- You're not gonna believe this.
- Oh, god.

1196
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:11,775
I've been thinking of you the whole time.

1197
01:43:11,810 --> 01:43:13,490
- During the whole fight!
- Can we just go?

1198
01:43:17,535 --> 01:43:18,597
Come on.

1199
01:43:20,039 --> 01:43:21,516
Hold up.

1200
01:43:24,542 --> 01:43:25,873
Where did you learn how to fly?

1201
01:43:26,074 --> 01:43:27,574
In Tehran.

1202
01:43:40,644 --> 01:43:42,256
Warning, we got reinforcements.

1203
01:43:53,090 --> 01:43:53,922
Shit.

1204
01:44:00,912 --> 01:44:03,614
Drummer, there's another wave coming.

1205
01:44:03,849 --> 01:44:05,602
The only way out is up.

1206
01:44:06,037 --> 01:44:06,648
On my way.

1207
01:44:07,483 --> 01:44:08,642
Evac in 5.

1208
01:44:09,277 --> 01:44:10,518
Got it.

1209
01:44:10,553 --> 01:44:12,029
Everybody get to the roof now.

1210
01:44:12,064 --> 01:44:13,893
Got it.

1211
01:44:20,238 --> 01:44:22,661
Trench, Yang, come on, clear the roof.

1212
01:44:22,696 --> 01:44:24,073
Let's go.

1213
01:44:40,859 --> 01:44:42,237
Damn.

1214
01:45:17,829 --> 01:45:19,656
- Always this easy?
- Pretty much.

1215
01:45:19,691 --> 01:45:21,991
How hard can it be to kill 10 men?

1216
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,800
You think you could even just wound a couple?

1217
01:45:23,912 --> 01:45:25,600
Watch closely.

1218
01:45:25,635 --> 01:45:26,721
And again.

1219
01:45:28,443 --> 01:45:29,356
Anybody else?

1220
01:45:29,391 --> 01:45:31,504
Useless bunch...

1221
01:45:33,455 --> 01:45:35,675
You want something done right...

1222
01:45:51,231 --> 01:45:53,092
You got valet parking here?

1223
01:45:55,207 --> 01:45:56,648
Yeah, there's some right here.

1224
01:45:56,683 --> 01:45:57,802
Go go go.

1225
01:46:06,458 --> 01:46:07,264
Don't stop.

1226
01:46:07,299 --> 01:46:08,652
Come on guys, move it.

1227
01:46:31,241 --> 01:46:32,785
Drummer, we're pinned down.

1228
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:34,255
Stop mumbling.

1229
01:46:38,149 --> 01:46:39,223
Good morning.

1230
01:46:39,258 --> 01:46:40,984
Let's get to the chopper.

1231
01:46:41,019 --> 01:46:42,241
Let's go.

1232
01:46:42,276 --> 01:46:43,757
Go go go go move go.

1233
01:46:48,015 --> 01:46:49,385
Go gotta go.

1234
01:46:51,777 --> 01:46:52,875
- Yang?
- You're welcome.

1235
01:46:52,910 --> 01:46:55,092
You're working for Trench?

1236
01:46:55,127 --> 01:46:56,396
Yeah, he pay me more money.

1237
01:46:58,725 --> 01:47:00,890
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm the guy that just saved your ass.

1238
01:47:00,891 --> 01:47:02,491
(Spanish profanity...)

1239
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:06,600
Batteries at 2%.

1240
01:47:11,645 --> 01:47:13,092
Hey Barney, leaving so soon?

1241
01:47:13,127 --> 01:47:14,566
Come on, let's finish this.

1242
01:47:20,510 --> 01:47:21,397
How you feeling?

1243
01:47:29,117 --> 01:47:30,656
Come on, stand up, you'll feel better.

1244
01:47:36,541 --> 01:47:37,381
Barney where are you?

1245
01:47:42,625 --> 01:47:45,018
Lose the armor, I want you to feel this.

1246
01:47:45,019 --> 01:47:47,124
Barney we gotta go.

1247
01:47:50,504 --> 01:47:53,598
And don't even think about going
for that piece of garbage in the bag.

1248
01:47:57,022 --> 01:47:58,216
Come on.

1249
01:47:58,251 --> 01:47:59,639
That's it.

1250
01:48:08,288 --> 01:48:10,248
We don't need these, do we?

1251
01:48:18,768 --> 01:48:19,892
Come on.

1252
01:48:21,179 --> 01:48:23,007
Barney we gotta go.

1253
01:48:35,162 --> 01:48:37,098
Batteries at 1%.

1254
01:48:37,133 --> 01:48:38,392
Come on Barney.

1255
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:19,342
What about The Hague huh?

1256
01:49:24,368 --> 01:49:26,124
I am The Hague.

1257
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:28,444
Batteries gone.

1258
01:49:32,227 --> 01:49:33,731
Gotta go, gotta go.

1259
01:49:33,766 --> 01:49:35,696
No don't, wait, wait.

1260
01:49:35,731 --> 01:49:37,953
I can't wait.

1261
01:49:46,454 --> 01:49:47,454
Go!

1262
01:49:48,655 --> 01:49:50,655
Come on, Barney! Go!

1263
01:49:57,017 --> 01:49:58,417
What the hell!

1264
01:49:58,718 --> 01:49:59,603
You owe me Barney.

1265
01:50:00,538 --> 01:50:02,691
Barney!

1266
01:50:45,972 --> 01:50:46,664
Pull me up.

1267
01:50:46,699 --> 01:50:49,265
You're gonna fire us again, Barney?

1268
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:51,374
Come on!

1269
01:50:51,409 --> 01:50:52,661
Can't hear you, pal!

1270
01:50:52,696 --> 01:50:54,555
I'm gonna kill you!

1271
01:50:57,752 --> 01:50:59,684
Alright, I'm sorry!

1272
01:50:59,819 --> 01:51:01,688
- Pull me up you idiots.
- Don't pull him up.

1273
01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:24,258
To Caeser.

1274
01:51:26,055 --> 01:51:27,145
Caeser.

1275
01:51:33,715 --> 01:51:34,411
Yo Barney.

1276
01:51:34,446 --> 01:51:35,116
Yeah.

1277
01:51:35,582 --> 01:51:37,441
I don't think I'll be needing this anymore.

1278
01:51:37,966 --> 01:51:39,692
You want your luck back?

1279
01:51:45,581 --> 01:51:46,661
I hope I didn't stretch it.

1280
01:51:46,666 --> 01:51:48,094
I think you did stretch it.

1281
01:51:49,247 --> 01:51:51,087
- Good to have you back man.
- Good to be back.

1282
01:51:51,336 --> 01:51:52,736
Don't scare us like that anymore, OK.

1283
01:51:52,737 --> 01:51:55,152
Hail Caeser.

1284
01:52:02,510 --> 01:52:03,750
You never got him to The Hague.

1285
01:52:05,667 --> 01:52:06,693
You know Drummer...

1286
01:52:07,797 --> 01:52:09,197
Working with you ain't been so bad.

1287
01:52:12,821 --> 01:52:15,006
I haven't had so much fun in years.

1288
01:52:15,553 --> 01:52:16,957
Fun's important.

1289
01:52:20,474 --> 01:52:21,833
These guys are nuts.

1290
01:52:21,868 --> 01:52:25,680
Our power's combined...

1291
01:52:25,715 --> 01:52:27,855
Yes, you are.

1292
01:52:27,890 --> 01:52:31,483
Come on, there must be a plan.

1293
01:52:31,518 --> 01:52:34,436
- Woah, Major Old-School.
- Major Badass

1294
01:52:34,471 --> 01:52:35,804
I'll drink to that.

1295
01:52:38,406 --> 01:52:40,546
I am sure I have done enough.

1296
01:52:40,581 --> 01:52:43,452
That I am worth my weight, in gold you know...

1297
01:52:43,487 --> 01:52:47,888
Am I close? And since I am as crazy as you...

1298
01:52:49,014 --> 01:52:50,986
I am sure I feel game...

1299
01:52:51,021 --> 01:52:52,276
- Galgo?
- Yes sir?

1300
01:52:58,535 --> 01:52:59,628
Welcome aboard.

1301
01:52:59,663 --> 01:53:00,616
Thank God!

1302
01:53:01,451 --> 01:53:03,740
Because I already spent a fortune on this.

1303
01:53:03,775 --> 01:53:04,698
You know what I mean.

1304
01:53:04,733 --> 01:53:06,615
I am so happy.

1305
01:53:07,649 --> 01:53:08,849
Barney, thank you.

1306
01:53:09,078 --> 01:53:11,178
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1307
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:13,630
- No hugging.
- No hugging.

1308
01:53:33,049 --> 01:53:34,049
Ooh...

1309
01:53:35,550 --> 01:53:36,998
Best two out of three.

1310
01:53:38,262 --> 01:53:40,362
- Hey!
- Hey!

1311
01:53:40,363 --> 01:53:41,523
- Just wanted to say thanks.

1312
01:53:42,686 --> 01:53:43,395
For what?

1313
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:45,328
- For caring.
- Oh, come on.

1314
01:53:47,958 --> 01:53:50,452
- You know, if you were 30 years younger..
- I'd be afraid of you.

1315
01:53:50,487 --> 01:53:52,336
Cheers.

1316
01:53:54,223 --> 01:53:57,478
Hey Yang, looks like you had a growth spurt.

1317
01:53:57,513 --> 01:53:59,222
Tall people don't live long.

1318
01:54:01,121 --> 01:54:02,634
So you're working for Trench now.

1319
01:54:04,048 --> 01:54:06,013
And you, I thought you retired.

1320
01:54:06,048 --> 01:54:06,674
I lied.

1321
01:54:07,209 --> 01:54:07,809
Good.

1322
01:54:15,801 --> 01:54:17,063
You guys want to get a room?

1323
01:54:22,973 --> 01:54:24,057
So jealous.

1324
01:54:24,092 --> 01:54:27,050
We came in this thing together,
we gonna leave here together.

1325
01:54:27,085 --> 01:54:28,637
Absolutely.

1326
01:54:28,672 --> 01:54:30,155
Cheers.

1327
01:54:34,947 --> 01:54:37,196
You know for a guy that
doesn't take orders very well.

1328
01:54:37,231 --> 01:54:38,567
You did pretty good.

1329
01:54:38,602 --> 01:54:39,963
Yeah?

1330
01:54:39,998 --> 01:54:42,079
So when do I take over?

1331
01:54:42,114 --> 01:54:44,960
Keep drinking.

1332
01:54:45,798 --> 01:54:46,782
Hey Smilee!

1333
01:54:47,556 --> 01:54:48,972
Get over here.

1334
01:54:50,476 --> 01:54:51,728
You did good kid.

1335
01:55:29,883 --> 01:55:33,147
You look like a proud, demented father.

1336
01:55:33,182 --> 01:55:35,649
You could've skipped the demented part.

1337
01:55:37,566 --> 01:55:38,830
It was a compliment.

1338
01:55:38,854 --> 01:55:43,854
