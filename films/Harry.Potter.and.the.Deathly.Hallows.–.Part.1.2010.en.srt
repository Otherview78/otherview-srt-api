1
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,083
These are dark times, there is no denying.

2
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:47,297
Our world has, perhaps,
faced no greater threat than it does today.

3
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:52,261
But I say this to our citizenry:

4
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:56,306
We, ever your servants...

5
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,142
...will continue to defend your liberty...

6
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,647
...and repel the forces
that seek to take it from you.

7
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:10,153
Your Ministry remains...

8
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,656
...strong.

9
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,175
Hermione. Tea's ready, darling.

10
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,303
Coming, Mom.

11
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,142
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

12
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:43,353
I still don't understand
why we have to leave.

13
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,275
Because, unh,
it's not safe for us here anymore.

14
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:08,045
Ron, tell your father
supper's nearly ready.

15
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,760
Is this in Australia?

16
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,887
Looks wonderful, doesn't it?

17
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:21,933
<i>Three and a half thousand
kilometers along Australia's east coast.</i>

18
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,770
<i>Obliviate.</i>

19
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,780
Severus.

20
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,326
I was beginning to worry
you had lost your way.

21
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,954
Come, we've saved you a seat.

22
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,710
You bring news, I trust?

23
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:57,547
It will happen Saturday next, at nightfall.

24
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,091
I've heard differently, my Lord.

25
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,386
Dawlish, the Auror,
has let slip that the Potter boy...

26
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,681
...will not be moved
until the 30th of this month.

27
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,391
The day before he turns 17.

28
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,770
This is a false trail.

29
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:16,608
The Auror Office no longer plays any part
in the protection of Harry Potter.

30
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:21,154
Those closest to him believe
we have infiltrated the Ministry.

31
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,365
Well, they got that right, haven't they?

32
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,288
What say you, Pius?

33
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,419
One hears many things, my Lord.

34
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,172
Whether the truth is among them
is not clear.

35
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,717
Heh. Spoken like a true politician.

36
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,929
You will, I think,
prove most useful, Pius.

37
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,769
- Where will he be taken, the boy?
- To a safe house.

38
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,814
Most likely the home of someone
in the Order.

39
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:59,234
I'm told it's been given
every manner of protection possible.

40
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,988
Once there,
it will be impractical to attack him.

41
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:08,118
Ahem. My Lord.
I'd like to volunteer myself for this task.

42
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:09,286
I want to kill the boy.

43
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,830
Wormtail!

44
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,916
Have I not spoken to you
about keeping our guest quiet?

45
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,043
Yes, my Lord.

46
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,879
Right away, my Lord.

47
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,634
As inspiring
as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix...

48
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,346
...I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.

49
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:35,645
But I face an unfortunate complication.

50
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:40,984
That my wand and Potter's
share the same core.

51
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:48,825
They are, in some ways, twins.

52
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:53,663
We can wound,
but not fatally harm one another.

53
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,084
If I am to kill him...

54
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,505
...I must do it with another's wand.

55
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:10,221
Come, surely one of you
would like the honor?

56
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,516
Mm?

57
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:20,023
What about you, Lucius?

58
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,902
My Lord?

59
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,029
"My Lord?"

60
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,742
I require your wand.

61
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,549
Do I detect elm?

62
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,677
Yes, my Lord.

63
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,560
And the core?

64
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,896
Dragon. Ahem.

65
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,731
Dragon heart string, my Lord.

66
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,067
- Dragon heart string.
- Mm.

67
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,584
To those of you who do not know...

68
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,421
...we are joined tonight
by Miss Charity Burbage...

69
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:30,093
...who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

70
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,722
Her specialty was Muggle Studies.

71
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:43,189
It is Miss Burbage's belief
that Muggles are not so different from us.

72
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,985
She would, given her way...

73
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,696
...have us mate with them.

74
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:59,581
To her, the mixture of magical
and Muggle blood is not an abomination...

75
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:02,792
...but something to be encouraged.

76
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,712
Severus.

77
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,839
Severus, please.

78
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,676
We're friends.

79
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,016
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

80
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,320
Nagini.

81
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,575
Dinner.

82
00:09:35,575 --> 00:10:05,575
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

83
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:24,267
- Hello, Harry.
- All right. Wow.

84
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:25,560
Hello.

85
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,605
- You're looking fit.
- Yeah, he's absolutely gorgeous.

86
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,274
What say we get undercover
before someone murders him?

87
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,442
Evening.

88
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,948
I thought you were looking after...

89
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,950
- ...the Prime Minister.
- You are more important.

90
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:45,079
- Hello, Harry. Bill Weasley.
- Oh. Pleasure to meet you.

91
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,249
- He was never always this handsome.
- Dead ugly.

92
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,792
True enough.

93
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,503
Owe it all to a werewolf,
name of Greyback.

94
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,049
- Hope to repay the favor one day.
- You're still beautiful to me, William.

95
00:11:56,424 --> 00:12:00,053
Just remember, Fleur,
Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now.

96
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,555
My husband, the joker.

97
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,975
By the way, wait till you hear the news.
Remus and I--

98
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,603
All right. We'll have time
for a cozy catch-up later.

99
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,731
We've got to get the hell out of here.
And soon.

100
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,652
Potter, you're underage, which means
you've still got the Trace on you.

101
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:16,861
What's the Trace?

102
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,697
If you sneeze, the Ministry will know
who wipes your nose.

103
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,034
We have to use those means of transport
the Trace can't detect:

104
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,536
Brooms, Thestrals and the like.
We go in pairs.

105
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,499
That way, if anyone's out there waiting
for us, and I reckon there will be...

106
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,168
...they won't know which Harry Potter
is the real one.

107
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:33,753
The real one?

108
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,174
I believe you're familiar
with this particular brew.

109
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,677
No. Absolutely not.

110
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,178
I told you he'd take it well.

111
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,473
No, if you think I'm gonna let everyone
risk their lives for me, I--

112
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,685
- Never done that before, have we?
- No. No. This is different.

113
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,853
I mean, taking that, becoming me. No.

114
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,855
Well, none of us really fancy it, mate.

115
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:57,193
Imagine if something went wrong, and
we ended up a scrawny, specky git forever.

116
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,028
Everyone here is of age, Potter.

117
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,197
They've all agreed to take the risk.

118
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,451
Technically, I've been coerced.

119
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,829
Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter.

120
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,540
- Always been a huge admirer.
- Nip it, Mundungus.

121
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,377
All right, Granger, as discussed.

122
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,255
- Blimey, Hermione.
- Straight in here, if you please.

123
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,310
For those of you who haven't taken
Poly juice Potion before, fair warning:

124
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,104
It tastes like goblin piss.

125
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,232
Have a lot of experiences with that,
do you, Mad-Eye?

126
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,069
Just trying to diffuse the tension.

127
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,905
Oh.

128
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,744
Ugh.

129
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,103
Wow, we're identical.

130
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,271
Not yet, you're not.

131
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,569
Haven't got anything
a bit more sporting, have you?

132
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,196
I don't really fancy this color.

133
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,157
Well, fancy this, you're not you.
So shut it and strip.

134
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,909
All right, all right.

135
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,619
You'll need to change too, Potter.

136
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,789
Bill, look away. I'm hideous.

137
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,249
I knew she was lying about that tattoo.

138
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,835
Harry, your eyesight really is awful.

139
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,714
Right, then. We'll be pairing off.
Each Potter will have a protector.

140
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,176
Mundungus, stick tight to me.
I wanna keep an eye on you.

141
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,553
- As for Harry--
- Yes?

142
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,806
The real Harry.

143
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,308
- Where the devil are you, anyway?
- Here.

144
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,477
You'll ride with Hagrid.

145
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:59,649
I brought you here 16 years ago when
you were no bigger than a Bowtruckle.

146
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,609
Seems only right that I should be...

147
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:05,822
- ...the one to take you away now.
- Yes, it's all very touching. Let's go.

148
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,047
Head for the Burrows.
We'll rendezvous there.

149
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,675
On the count of three.

150
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,552
Hold tight, Harry.

151
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,512
One...

152
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,181
...two...

153
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,398
...three!

154
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,556
- Which one?
- Where are you?

155
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,517
He's on your right!

156
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,311
He's over there!

157
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,146
Down!

158
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,278
Hagrid, we have to help the others!

159
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,573
I can't do that, Harry. Mad-Eye's orders.

160
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,332
Hang on.

161
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,212
<i>Stupefy!</i>

162
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,019
Hang on, Harry.

163
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,781
Hagrid.

164
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,300
No. No.

165
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,366
<i>Harry.</i>

166
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,407
Harry. Hagrid.

167
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:23,245
What happened? Where are the others?

168
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,580
Is no one else back?

169
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:28,334
They were on us right from
the start, Molly. We didn't stand a chance.

170
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,670
Well, thank goodness
you two are all right.

171
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,423
The Death Eaters were
waiting for us. It was an ambush.

172
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,967
Ron and Tonks
should've already been back.

173
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,344
Dad and Fred as well.

174
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,932
Here!

175
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,019
Quick. Into the house.

176
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,775
Oh, my boy.

177
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,446
Oh. Oh.

178
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,324
- Lupin!
- What are you doing?

179
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,788
What creature sat in the corner...

180
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:09,291
...the first time Harry Potter
visited my office in Hogwarts?

181
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,085
- Are you mad?
- What creature?!

182
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,087
A Grindylow.

183
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,095
We've been betrayed.

184
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,639
Voldemort knew
you were being moved tonight.

185
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,725
I had to make sure
you weren't an impostor.

186
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,317
Wait.

187
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,825
The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke
to the pair of us?

188
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,998
"Harry is the best hope we have.
Trust him."

189
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:54,670
What gave you away?

190
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:57,965
Hedwig, I think.
She was trying to protect me.

191
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:15,733
Thanks.

192
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,068
Deserves that. Brilliant, he was.

193
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:21,363
- I wouldn't be standing here without him.
- Really?

194
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,034
Always the tone of surprise.

195
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,418
We the last back?

196
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,754
Where's George?

197
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,277
How you feeling, Georgie?

198
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,822
Saint-like.

199
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,241
Come again?

200
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,746
Saint-like. I'm holy.

201
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:14,333
I'm holey, Fred. Get it?

202
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:20,839
The whole wide world of ear-related humor
and you go for "I'm holey."

203
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,174
That's pathetic.

204
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,094
Reckon I'm still better-looking than you.

205
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,808
Mad-Eye's dead.

206
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,947
Mundungus took one look at Voldemort
and Disapparated.

207
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,888
<i>Head for the Burrows.</i>

208
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,057
<i>This is beyond anything I imagined.</i>

209
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,852
<i>- Seven?</i>
<i>- Seven...? A Horcrux.</i>

210
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:16,478
<i>They could be hidden anywhere.</i>

211
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,814
<i>To rip the soul into seven pieces...</i>

212
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,984
<i>- if you did destroy each Horcrux...</i>
<i>- One destroys Voldemort.</i>

213
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,197
<i>Trust me.</i>

214
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:31,702
<i>You lied to me. Lied to me, Ollivander.</i>

215
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,569
Going somewhere?

216
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:13,368
Nobody else is going to die. Not for me.

217
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,329
For you?

218
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,706
You think Mad-Eye died for you?

219
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,834
You think George took that curse
for you?

220
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:25,547
You may be the Chosen One, mate,
but this is a whole lot bigger than that.

221
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,217
It's always been bigger than that.

222
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,930
- Come with me.
- What, and leave Hermione?

223
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:37,643
You mad?
We wouldn't last two days without her.

224
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,562
Don't tell her I said that.

225
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,359
Besides, you've still got
the Trace on you.

226
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:49,613
- We've still got the wedding--
- I don't care about a wedding.

227
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:54,660
I'm sorry. No matter whose it is.
I have to start finding these Horcruxes.

228
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,787
They're our only chance to beat him...

229
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:59,915
...and the longer we stay here,
the stronger he gets.

230
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,460
Tonight's not the night, mate.

231
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,255
We'd only be doing him a favor.

232
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,951
Do you think he knows?

233
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:42,541
I mean, they're bits of his soul,
these Horcruxes. Bits of him.

234
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:47,546
When Dumbledore destroyed the ring,
you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary...

235
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,633
...he must have felt something.

236
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:56,138
To kill the other Horcruxes,
we have to find them.

237
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,473
Where are they?

238
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:01,101
Where do we start?

239
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,647
Ready when you are.

240
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:11,653
Please pay attention!
It's your brother's wedding. Buck up.

241
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,181
Zip me up, will you?

242
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,947
It seems silly, doesn't it, a wedding?

243
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,824
Given everything that's going on.

244
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,161
Maybe that's the best reason to have it...

245
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,373
...because of everything that's going on.

246
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,557
Morning.

247
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,903
Come on, keep up.

248
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,239
All together now.

249
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:42,869
One, two, three.

250
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,382
How's it looking at your end, boys?

251
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,926
Brilliant.

252
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:04,891
Bloody hell.
What's the Minister of Magic doing here?

253
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,649
To what do we owe the pleasure,
Minister?

254
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:17,404
I think we both know the answer
to that question, Mr. Potter.

255
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,955
And this is...?

256
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:38,925
"Herein is set forth
the last will and testament...

257
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:43,680
...of Albus Percival Wulfric
Brian Dumbledore.

258
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:47,309
First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley...

259
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,813
...I leave my Deluminator...

260
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,232
...a device of my own making...

261
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,654
...in the hope that,
when things seem most dark...

262
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,159
...it will show him the light."

263
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,168
- Dumbledore left this for me?
- Yeah.

264
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,670
Brilliant.

265
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,548
What is it?

266
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,312
Wicked.

267
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,567
"To Hermione Jean Granger...

268
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:42,906
...I leave my copy of
<i>The Tales of Beedle the Bard...</i>

269
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:47,744
...in the hope that she find it
entertaining and instructive."

270
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:49,871
Mom used to read me those.

271
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,290
"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot."

272
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,377
"Babbitty Rabbitty
and the Cackling Stump."

273
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,549
Come on, Babbitty Rabbitty.

274
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,717
No?

275
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,846
"To Harry James Potter...

276
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:10,100
...I leave the Snitch he caught
in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts...

277
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:15,313
...as a reminder
of the rewards of perseverance...

278
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,734
...and skill."

279
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,883
- Is that it, then?
- Not quite.

280
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:48,430
Dumbledore left you a second bequest:

281
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,683
The sword of Godric Gryffindor.

282
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:57,898
Unfortunately, the sword of Gryffindor
was not Dumbledore's to give away.

283
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,026
As an important historical artifact,
it belongs--

284
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,277
To Harry.

285
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,071
It belongs to Harry.

286
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,949
It came to him when he needed it
in the Chamber of Secrets.

287
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,994
The sword may present itself
to any worthy Gryffindor.

288
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,496
That does not make it
that wizard's property.

289
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:18,585
And, in any event, the current
whereabouts of the sword are unknown.

290
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:21,338
- Excuse me?
- The sword is missing.

291
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:26,259
I don't know what you're up to,
Mr. Potter...

292
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:30,388
...but you can't fight this war
on your own.

293
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,974
He's too strong.

294
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,412
Hello, Harry.

295
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:40,333
I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I?
I can see it growing smaller in your eyes.

296
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,043
Of course not. How are you, Luna?

297
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,838
Very well. Got bitten by a garden gnome
only moments ago.

298
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,340
Gnome saliva is very beneficial.

299
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,884
Xenophilius Lovegood.
We live just over the hill.

300
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,219
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

301
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,180
I trust you know, Mr. Potter,
that we at <i>The Quibbler...</i>

302
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,683
...unlike those toadies
at <i>The Daily Prophet...</i>

303
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,436
...fully supported Dumbledore
in his lifetime...

304
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:03,273
...and, in his death,
support you just as fully.

305
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:04,941
Thank you.

306
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,944
Come, Daddy.
Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now.

307
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,405
He's just too polite to say so.

308
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,657
Harry Potter.

309
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,330
Excuse me, sir? May I sit down?

310
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,916
Mr. Potter. By all means. Here.

311
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,752
Thanks.

312
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,758
I found what you wrote
in <i>The Daily Prophet</i> really moving.

313
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,094
You obviously knew Dumbledore well.

314
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,222
Well, I certainly knew him the longest.

315
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,100
That is, if you don't count his brother,
Aberforth...

316
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,312
...and somehow, people never do
seem to count Aberforth.

317
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,731
- I didn't even know he had a brother.
- Ah.

318
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:48,443
Well, Dumbledore was always
very private, even as a boy.

319
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,028
Don't despair, Elphias.

320
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:54,616
I'm told he's been thoroughly
unriddled by Rita Skeeter...

321
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,619
...in 800 pages, no less.

322
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:02,665
Word has it that someone talked to her.

323
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,627
Someone who knew
the Dumbledore family well.

324
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,631
Both you and I know who that is,
Elphias.

325
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,299
A monstrous betrayal.

326
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,803
Who are we talking about?

327
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,390
Bathilda Bagshot.

328
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,142
- Who?
- My God, boy...

329
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:26,064
...she's only the most celebrated
magical historian of the last century.

330
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:31,986
She was as close
to the Dumbledores as anyone.

331
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:37,200
Oh, I'm sure Rita Skeeter thought
it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow...

332
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:40,578
...to take a peek
into that old bird's rattled cage.

333
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,580
Godric's Hollow?

334
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,916
Bathilda Bagshot
lives at Godric's Hollow?

335
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,419
Well, that's where
she first met Dumbledore.

336
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,462
You don't mean to say
he lived there too?

337
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:53,174
The family moved there
after his father killed those three Muggles.

338
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:57,011
Oh, it was quite the scandal.

339
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:02,016
Honestly, my boy,
are you sure you knew him at all?

340
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,546
<i>The Ministry has fallen.</i>

341
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:36,092
<i>The Minister of Magic is dead.</i>

342
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,889
<i>They are coming.</i>

343
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,141
<i>They are coming.</i>

344
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,894
<i>They are coming.</i>

345
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,562
They're coming!

346
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,399
Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter.

347
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,871
- Ginny!
- Harry! Go!

348
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:06,080
Go!

349
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,013
Here you go, sightseeing tour?
Leaves in 15 minutes.

350
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,100
- Where are we?
- Shaftesbury Avenue.

351
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:29,437
I used to come to the theater here
with Mom and Dad.

352
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,856
I don't know why I thought of it.
It just popped into my head.

353
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,109
This way.

354
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,990
We need to change.

355
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,206
How the ruddy...?

356
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,959
Undetectable Extension Charm.

357
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,628
You're amazing, you are.

358
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,422
Always the tone of surprise.

359
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,551
Ah. That'll be the books.

360
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,934
What about all the people
at the wedding?

361
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,561
- Do you think we should go back?
- They were after you.

362
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,897
We'd put everyone in danger
by going back.

363
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,484
- Ron's right.
- Ahem.

364
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,319
Coffee?

365
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:21,906
- A cappuccino, please.
- You?

366
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,035
- What she said.
- Same.

367
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:33,251
So where do we go from here?
Leaky Cauldron?

368
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,711
It's too dangerous.

369
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:39,173
If Voldemort has taken over the Ministry,
none of the old places are safe.

370
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,385
Everyone from the wedding
will have gone underground, into hiding.

371
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,054
My rucksack with all my things,
I've left it at the Burrow.

372
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,103
You're joking.

373
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:57,692
I've had all the essentials packed
for days, just in case.

374
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:00,028
By the way, these jeans, not my favorite.

375
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,280
Down!

376
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,699
<i>Stupefy!</i>

377
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,663
<i>Expulso!</i>

378
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,383
<i>Petrificus Totalus.</i>

379
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,597
Go.

380
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,223
Leave.

381
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:36,689
Lock the door, get the lights.

382
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,658
This one's name is Rowle.

383
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,579
He was on the Astronomy Tower
the night Snape killed Dumbledore.

384
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:56,918
This is Dolohov. I recognize him
from the wanted posters.

385
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,129
So, what we gonna do with you, hey?

386
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,091
Kill us if it was turned round,
wouldn't you?

387
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,592
if we kill them, they'll know we were here.

388
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,177
Ron.

389
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:10,306
Suppose he did Mad-Eye.
How would you feel then?

390
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,935
It's better we wipe their memories.

391
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,771
You're the boss.

392
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,815
Hermione...

393
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,778
...you're the best at spells.

394
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:43,631
<i>Obliviate.</i>

395
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,562
How is it they knew we were there?

396
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,313
Maybe you still have the Trace on you?

397
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,942
Can't be. Trace breaks at 17.
It's wizarding law.

398
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,320
What?

399
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:10,074
We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry.

400
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,703
Ginny and I, we prepared a cake.

401
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,831
We were going to bring it out
at the end of the wedding.

402
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:20,460
I appreciate the thought, but given the fact
that we were almost killed...

403
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:23,004
...by a couple of Death Eaters
a few minutes ago...

404
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,382
Right.

405
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,217
Perspective.

406
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,387
We need to get off the streets,
get somewhere safe.

407
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,547
What was that all about?

408
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:13,346
Probably Mad-Eye's idea,
in case Snape decided to come snooping.

409
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,481
<i>Homenum Revelio.</i>

410
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,948
We're alone.

411
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,998
<i>I believed another wand--</i>

412
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,626
<i>- You lied to me.</i>
<i>- It makes no sense.</i>

413
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,423
I believed a different wand would work,
I swear.

414
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,010
There must be another way.

415
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:07,084
Harry? Hermione, where are you?

416
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:09,670
I think I've found something.

417
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,011
Lovely.

418
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:26,228
"Regulus Arcturus Black."

419
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,105
R.A.B.

420
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:35,029
"I know I will be dead
long before you read this.

421
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:39,200
I have stolen the real Horcrux
and intend to destroy it."

422
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,994
R.A.B. is Sirius's brother.

423
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,205
Yes.

424
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:50,169
Question is,
did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?

425
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,068
You've been spying on us, have you?

426
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:18,697
Kreacher has been watching.

427
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,783
Maybe he knows where the real locket is.

428
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,746
Have you ever seen this before?

429
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,498
Kreacher?

430
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,751
It's Master Regulus' locket.

431
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,629
But there were two, weren't there?

432
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,340
Where's the other one?

433
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:43,431
Kreacher doesn't know
where the other locket is.

434
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,975
Yes, but did you ever see it?
Was it in this house?

435
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,309
Filthy Mudblood.

436
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,186
- Death Eaters are coming--
- Ron.

437
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,189
- Blood traitor, Weasley.
- Answer her.

438
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,193
Yes.

439
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,698
It was here in this house.

440
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,285
A most evil object.

441
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:05,703
How do you mean?

442
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:10,791
Before Master Regulus died,
he ordered Kreacher to destroy it...

443
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:16,213
...but no matter how hard Kreacher tried,
he could not do it.

444
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,965
Well, where is it now?

445
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:23,220
- Did someone take it?
- He came in the night.

446
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:28,058
He took many things,
including the locket.

447
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,768
Who did?

448
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,021
Who was it, Kreacher?

449
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,234
Mundungus.

450
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,905
Mundungus Fletcher.

451
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,574
Find him.

452
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,555
My father will hear about this.

453
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,729
Hey, losers.

454
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,690
He isn't here.

455
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,748
As your new Minister for Magic...

456
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:38,128
...I promise to restore
this temple of tolerance...

457
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,964
...to its former glory.

458
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:43,217
Therefore, beginning today...

459
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,055
...each employee
will submit themselves...

460
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,933
...for evaluation.

461
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,812
But know this:
You have nothing to fear...

462
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,982
...if you have nothing to hide.

463
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:03,988
- How much?
- Two Galleons.

464
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,657
Come on, time is money. Cheers, pal.

465
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,742
- Snatchers!
- Move out of the way.

466
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,417
- I told you.
- Get out.

467
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,626
Squash him.

468
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,470
Be a bit gentler.

469
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,707
They have flesh memories.

470
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:04,381
When Scrimgeour first gave it to you,
I thought it might open at your touch.

471
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,968
That Dumbledore had hidden
something inside it.

472
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,887
<i>Many of you are wondering...</i>

473
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,973
<i>...why Voldemort has yet to show himself
now that he has vanquished...</i>

474
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,226
<i>...the most powerful symbol of opposition
to him and his followers.</i>

475
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,313
Get off.

476
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,232
Harry Potter, so long it's been.

477
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,026
Get off me.

478
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:33,577
As requested,
Kreacher has returned with the thief...

479
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,746
- <i>Expelliarmus.</i>
- ...Mundungus Fletcher.

480
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,124
What you playing at? Setting a pair
of bleeding house-elves after me.

481
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,793
Dobby was only trying to help.

482
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:45,339
Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley,
which Dobby thought was curious.

483
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:49,843
And then Dobby heard Kreacher
mention Harry Potter's name.

484
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,846
- I just--
- And then Dobby saw Kreacher...

485
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,808
- ...talking with the thief, Mundungus--
- I'm no thief.

486
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:58,894
You foul little-- Git.

487
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:03,690
I'm a purveyor
of rare and wondrous objects.

488
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,734
You're a thief, Dung. Everyone knows it.

489
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,862
Master Weasley,
so good to see you again.

490
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,072
Wicked trainers.

491
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:14,576
Listen, I panicked that night, all right?

492
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,455
Could I help it
if Mad-Eye fell off his broom?

493
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:21,875
- You...
- Tell the truth.

494
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,837
When you turned this place over--
Don't deny it.

495
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,547
- -You found a locket, am I right?

496
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,966
Why? Was it valuable?

497
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,259
You still got it?

498
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:32,886
No, he's worried
he didn't get enough money for it.

499
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,555
Bleeding give it away, didn't I?

500
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:39,059
There I was,
flogging me wares in Diagon Alley...

501
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:43,230
...when some Ministry hag comes up
and asks to see me license.

502
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:45,524
Says she's a mind to lock me up.

503
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:49,361
And would've done it too,
if she hadn't taken a fancy to that locket.

504
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:53,449
- Who was she? The witch. Do you know?
- No, I--

505
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,665
Well, she's there. Look.

506
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,170
Bleeding bow and all.

507
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:50,797
Right, remember what we said.

508
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,801
Don't speak to anyone
unless absolutely necessary.

509
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:59,973
Just try and act normal.
Do what everybody else is doing.

510
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,519
If we do that, then with a bit of luck,
we'll get inside.

511
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,312
- And then--
- It gets really tricky.

512
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,314
- Correct.
- Yeah.

513
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:10,400
- This is completely mental.
- Completely.

514
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,611
The world's mental.

515
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,196
Come on...

516
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,241
...we've got a Horcrux to find.

517
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,547
We flush ourselves in.

518
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,345
That's bloody disgusting.

519
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:50,042
Name?

520
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,878
You. Come.

521
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:55,213
- What? What?
- Come on.

522
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,799
- What did I do?
- Just keep walking.

523
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,100
- Are those--?
- Muggles.

524
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:11,897
In their rightful place.

525
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:16,860
Gotta tell you,
I'm starting to freak out a bit.

526
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:23,617
How long did you say this batch
of Poly juice would last, Hermione?

527
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,202
I didn't.

528
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:34,294
Cattermole.

529
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:38,965
It's still raining inside my office.
That's two days now.

530
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,636
Have you tried an umbrella?

531
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,556
You do realize I'm going downstairs,
don't you, Cattermole?

532
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:51,103
- Downstairs?
- To interrogate your wife.

533
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:55,941
Now, if my wife's blood status
were in doubt...

534
00:53:56,108 --> 00:53:58,985
...and the head of the Department
of Magical Law Enforcement...

535
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:04,741
...needed a job doing,
I think I might just make that a priority.

536
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,494
You have one hour.

537
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:24,928
Oh, my God. What am I gonna do?
My wife's all alone downstairs.

538
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:29,516
- Ron, you don't have a wife.
- Oh, right.

539
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,643
<i>Level 2.</i>

540
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,563
But how do I stop it raining?

541
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:37,357
Try "<i>Finite Incantatem."</i>

542
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,359
<i>Department of Magical Law Enforcement...</i>

543
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:40,986
<i>...and Improper Use of Magic Department.</i>

544
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,113
This is you, Ron.

545
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:52,205
<i>Finite Incantatem.</i> Okay.
And if that doesn't work...?

546
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:07,053
<i>Level 1,
Minister of Magic and support staff.</i>

547
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,347
If we don't locate Umbridge
within the hour...

548
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,516
...we go find Ron
and come back another day.

549
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:12,726
- Deal?
- Yes.

550
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,607
Ah, Mafalda. Travers sent you, did he?

551
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:21,860
Good, we'll go straight down.

552
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:26,740
Albert, aren't you getting out?

553
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,108
Runcorn.

554
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,996
<i>Accio locket.</i>

555
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:53,887
All right, all right.
Let's calm down, shall we?

556
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:57,223
Let's get back to work, please.

557
00:57:58,058 --> 00:57:59,893
Calm down.

558
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,900
Runcorn.

559
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,493
Morning.

560
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,622
Ron, it's me.

561
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:24,626
Harry.
Blimey, forgot what you looked like.

562
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:26,252
Where's Hermione?

563
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:29,839
She's gone down to the courtrooms,
with Umbridge.

564
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,807
Bloody cold down here.

565
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:42,602
I'm a half-blood. My father was a wizard.

566
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,021
William Alderton.
He worked here for 30 years.

567
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:48,692
Perhaps you know him.
Always wore his jacket inside out.

568
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,319
No, there's been a mistake.
I'm half-blood, you see.

569
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:54,698
We must go back. I'm half-blood.

570
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,918
- Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?
- Yes.

571
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:12,006
Of 27 Chislehurst Gardens,
Great Tolling, Evesham?

572
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,216
- Yes.
- It's here.

573
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:18,179
Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred?
Wife to Reginald?

574
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,476
Reg?

575
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,865
Thank you, Albert.

576
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:42,203
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?

577
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,498
Yes.

578
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:50,044
A wand was taken from you
upon your arrival at the Ministry today.

579
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:53,006
Is this that wand?

580
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:59,345
Would you please tell the court from which
witch or wizard you took this wand?

581
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:01,973
I didn't take it.

582
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:09,022
I got it in Diagon Alley, at Ollivander's,
when I was 11.

583
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,942
It chose me.

584
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,070
You're lying.

585
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:21,075
Wands only choose witches,
and you are not a witch.

586
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:23,286
But I am.

587
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:26,790
Tell them, Reg. Tell them what I am.

588
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,710
Reg, tell them what I am.

589
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:42,430
What on earth are you doing, Albert?

590
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,227
You're lying, Dolores.

591
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:52,190
And one mustn't tell lies.

592
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,275
<i>Stupefy!</i>

593
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,368
It's Harry Potter.

594
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:05,995
It is, isn't it?
This'll be one to tell the kids.

595
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,179
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

596
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,455
Oh. Oh. Oh.

597
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:51,666
Mary, go home.

598
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,586
Get the kids.

599
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:58,131
I'll meet you there. We have to get out
of the country, understand?

600
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:00,758
Mary, do as I say.

601
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:16,316
Mary?

602
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,861
Who's that?

603
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,990
Long story. Nice meeting you.

604
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,533
It's Harry Potter.

605
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,202
It's Harry. Harry Potter.

606
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:30,413
- There he is.
- Get him!

607
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,665
- Get him!
- Stop him!

608
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,762
- Watch out.
- Look out.

609
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:47,513
This way!

610
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:08,368
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

611
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:56,874
Oh, my God.

612
01:03:57,041 --> 01:04:00,670
Shh, shh, shh. It's all right. It's okay.

613
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:06,342
Harry. Harry, quickly, in my bag.

614
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,053
There's a bottle labeled
"Essence of Dittany."

615
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:14,434
Shh. Shh.

616
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,270
Okay, okay. Quickly.

617
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:20,148
- <i>Accio Dittany.</i>
- Shh.

618
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:23,276
It's all right. Unstopper it.

619
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:24,861
Hermione, his arm.

620
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,113
I know, just do it.

621
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,574
It's okay.

622
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:34,787
- Okay, it's gonna sting a little bit.
- What happened? I thought we meant...

623
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,707
- ...to be going back to Grimmauld Place.
- We were. We were. Shh.

624
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,709
It's all right. One more, one more.

625
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:44,422
We were there, we were there,
but Yaxley had hold of me, and I...

626
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:47,633
I knew once he'd seen where we were,
we couldn't stay...

627
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,928
...so I brought us here...

628
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:54,015
...but Ron got splinched.

629
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:58,895
It's all right.

630
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:20,333
<i>Protego Totalum.</i>

631
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:23,252
<i>Salvio Hexia.</i>

632
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,837
What are you doing?

633
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:27,298
Protective enchantments.

634
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:31,052
I don't fancy another visit like the one
we had in Shaftesbury Avenue, do you?

635
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:32,929
You can get going on the tent.

636
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,431
- Tent?
<i>- Protego Totalum.</i>

637
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,725
Where am I supposed to find a tent?

638
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:42,188
<i>Repello Muggletum. Muffliato.</i>

639
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:53,825
You first.

640
01:05:57,411 --> 01:05:59,539
<i>Dissendium.</i>

641
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,054
<i>Incendio.</i>

642
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:22,478
<i>Expulso.</i>

643
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:31,821
<i>Diffindo.</i>

644
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,282
<i>Reducto.</i>

645
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,597
What are you doing?

646
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,767
We have to keep it safe
until we find out how to destroy it.

647
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:04,604
Seems strange, mate.
Dumbledore sends you off...

648
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:08,566
...to find all these Horcruxes,
but doesn't tell you how to destroy them.

649
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:10,359
Doesn't that bother you?

650
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:26,125
<i>A goblin by the name of Gornuk was killed.</i>

651
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:29,378
<i>It is believed that Muggle-born
Dean Thomas and a second goblin...</i>

652
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:32,465
<i>...both believed to have been traveling
with Tonks, Cresswell...</i>

653
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,175
<i>...and Gornuk, may have escaped.</i>

654
01:07:34,342 --> 01:07:38,137
<i>If Dean is listening or anyone has
any knowledge of his whereabouts...</i>

655
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:41,349
<i>...his parents and sisters
are desperate for news.</i>

656
01:07:41,515 --> 01:07:44,894
<i>Meanwhile, a Muggle family of five
has been found dead in their home.</i>

657
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:48,314
<i>You know the spell, Harry.</i>

658
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,319
<i>Tell me.</i>

659
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:57,823
<i>Tell me, Gregorovitch.</i>

660
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,617
It was stolen from me.

661
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:03,245
Who was he? The thief?

662
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:10,336
<i>It was a boy. It was he who took it.</i>

663
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:13,005
<i>I never saw it again.</i>

664
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,007
I swear on my life.

665
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:17,009
I believe you.

666
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:24,767
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

667
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:40,908
I thought it had stopped.

668
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:45,246
You can't keep letting him in, Harry.

669
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:50,251
You-Know-Who has found Gregorovitch.

670
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,128
The wandmaker?

671
01:08:52,294 --> 01:08:56,841
He wants something
that Gregorovitch used to have...

672
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:58,467
...but I don't know what.

673
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:04,640
But he wants it desperately.
I mean, it's as if his life depends on it.

674
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:07,727
Don't.

675
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:10,062
- It comforts him.
- It sets my teeth on edge.

676
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:12,481
What's he expecting to hear,
good news?

677
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:15,526
<i>who long expected it,
the fall of the Ministry was shocking.</i>

678
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:18,070
I think he just hopes
he doesn't hear bad news.

679
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,156
<i>We promise
to remain your eyes and ears--</i>

680
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:21,741
How long before he can travel?

681
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:25,119
<i>--Bringing you news when we can,
from wherever we can.</i>

682
01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:26,579
I'm doing everything I can.

683
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:28,289
You're not doing enough!

684
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:33,085
Take it off.

685
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,422
I said, take it <i>off</i> now.

686
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:50,144
- Better?
- Loads.

687
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:56,108
We'll take it in turns, okay?

688
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:28,557
<i>Finch does admit
his invention currently has one short.</i>

689
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:30,184
<i>And now, other news:</i>

690
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:33,646
<i>Severus Snape, newly appointed
headmaster of Hogwarts...</i>

691
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:37,566
<i>...has decreed that all students
must conform to the latest house rules.</i>

692
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:07,680
<i>Hogwarts bears little resemblance
to the school...</i>

693
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:09,640
<i>...under Dumbledore's leadership.</i>

694
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:13,435
<i>Snape's curriculum is severe,
reflecting the wishes of the Dark Lord...</i>

695
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:19,191
<i>...and infractions are dealt with harshly
by the two Death Eaters on staff.</i>

696
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:40,045
What's that?

697
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:52,057
What's that smell?

698
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:16,582
- What you doing?
- It's heavy.

699
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:18,334
Oh, sorry. Do you want me to carry it?

700
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:21,420
- Yeah, thank you.
- Don't be ridiculous. Pick it up.

701
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,048
Numpty.

702
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:31,138
Snatchers.

703
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:34,600
Good to know your enchantments work.

704
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:43,275
He could smell it. My perfume.

705
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:47,571
I've told you...

706
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,865
...Ron isn't strong enough to Apparate.

707
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:53,786
Well, then, we'll go on foot.

708
01:12:54,578 --> 01:12:59,500
And next time, Hermione, as much as
I like your perfume, just don't wear any.

709
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:08,300
<i>And now for the names
of missing witches and wizards.</i>

710
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:11,303
<i>These are confirmed.</i>

711
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:15,516
<i>Thankfully, the list is short today.</i>

712
01:13:16,266 --> 01:13:18,310
<i>Jason and Alison Denbright.</i>

713
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:20,229
Oh. Thank you.

714
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:24,149
<i>Bella, Jake, Charlie and Madge Farley.</i>

715
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:25,484
<i>Joe Laurie.</i>

716
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:29,405
<i>Eleanor Sarah Gibbs.</i>

717
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:33,867
<i>Harry and Bronwyn Trigg.</i>

718
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:38,539
<i>Rob and Ellie Dowson.</i>

719
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:42,167
<i>Georgia Clark-Day.</i>

720
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:45,295
<i>Joshua Flexson.</i>

721
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:47,172
<i>George Coutas.</i>

722
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:51,176
<i>Gabriella and Emily Mather.</i>

723
01:13:52,177 --> 01:13:55,305
<i>Jacob and Mimi Erland.</i>

724
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:57,850
<i>William and Brian Gallagher.</i>

725
01:13:58,017 --> 01:14:00,477
He doesn't know
what he's doing, does he?

726
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:05,190
None of us do.

727
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:10,529
<i>Toby and Olivia Gleaves.</i>

728
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:14,033
<i>Katie and James Killick.</i>

729
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:16,702
<i>Elsie Valentine Schroeder.</i>

730
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:19,872
<i>Jennifer Winston.</i>

731
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:23,167
<i>Tamsin and Lola Hillicker.</i>

732
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:25,377
<i>Scarlet and Kitty Sharp.</i>

733
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:46,231
Oh, my God.

734
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:48,233
What?

735
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:50,819
I'll tell you in a minute.

736
01:14:51,361 --> 01:14:54,073
Maybe you could tell me now.

737
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:57,451
The sword of Gryffindor,
it's goblin-made.

738
01:14:57,618 --> 01:14:58,744
Brilliant.

739
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:02,206
No, you don't understand.

740
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:04,917
Dirt and rust have no effect
on the blade.

741
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:09,254
It only takes in
that which makes it stronger.

742
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:11,048
Okay.

743
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,718
Harry, you've already destroyed
one Horcrux, right?

744
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:17,137
Tom Riddle's diary
in the Chamber of Secrets.

745
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:20,224
With a Basilisk fang.
If you tell me you've got one of those...

746
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:23,852
- ...in that bloody beaded bag of yours...
- Don't you see?

747
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:27,773
In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed
the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor.

748
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:31,443
Its blade is impregnated
with Basilisk venom.

749
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:33,737
It only takes in
that which makes it stronger.

750
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:37,074
- Exactly, which is why--
- It can destroy Horcruxes.

751
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:39,493
That's why Dumbledore left it to you
in his will.

752
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:44,081
You are brilliant, Hermione. Truly.

753
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:48,293
Actually, I'm highly logical, which
allows me to look past extraneous detail...

754
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,963
...and perceive clearly
that which others overlook.

755
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:53,841
Yeah, there's only one problem,
of course.

756
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:01,348
The sword was stolen.

757
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:05,310
Yeah, I'm still here.

758
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:09,940
But you two carry on.
Don't let me spoil the fun.

759
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:15,320
- What's wrong?
- Wrong? Nothing's wrong.

760
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,364
Not according to you, anyway.

761
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:21,160
Look, if you've got something to say,
don't be shy. Spit it out.

762
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:24,830
All right, I'll spit it out.
But don't expect me to be grateful...

763
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,541
...because there's another damn thing
we've gotta find.

764
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:30,002
I thought you knew
what you signed up for.

765
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:32,337
Yeah. I thought I did too.

766
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:35,549
Well, then I'm sorry,
but I don't quite understand.

767
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:39,178
What part of this isn't living up
to your expectations?

768
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:41,638
Did you think we were gonna
be staying in a hotel?

769
01:16:41,805 --> 01:16:45,058
Finding a Horcrux every other day?
Thought you'd be back by Christmas?

770
01:16:45,225 --> 01:16:47,060
I just thought, after all this time...

771
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:50,689
...we would've achieved something.
I thought you knew what you were doing.

772
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:53,233
I thought Dumbledore told you
something worthwhile.

773
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,612
- I thought you had a plan.
- I told you everything Dumbledore told me.

774
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:58,989
In case you haven't noticed,
we found a Horcrux.

775
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:03,035
Yeah, and we're as close to getting rid of it
as we are to finding the rest of them.

776
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:05,787
Ron. Please, take--

777
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,707
Take the Horcrux off.
You wouldn't be saying this...

778
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:10,209
...if you hadn't been wearing it all day.

779
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:12,794
Want to know why I listen to that radio?

780
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:17,633
To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name,
or Fred, or George or Mom.

781
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,886
You think I'm not listening?
You think I don't know how this feels?!

782
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:22,596
No, you don't know how it feels!

783
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:25,140
Your parents are dead.
You have no family.

784
01:17:26,225 --> 01:17:28,977
- Stop. Stop.
- Fine, then go!

785
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:30,979
Go, then!

786
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:34,900
Fine.

787
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,738
Ron.

788
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:44,743
And you?

789
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:49,039
Are you coming or you staying?

790
01:17:56,129 --> 01:17:59,216
Fine. I get it.

791
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:01,802
I saw you two the other night.

792
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:04,638
Ron, that's-- That's nothing.

793
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:08,141
Ron--

794
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,689
Ron, where are you going?

795
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,942
Please, come back.

796
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:20,112
Ron.

797
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:25,826
Ron!

798
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:30,766
<i>Salvio Hexia.</i>

799
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:36,688
<i>Repellum Muggletum.</i>

800
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:42,194
<i>Salvio Hexia.</i>

801
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:06,176
<i>Poor old Jim's white as a ghost</i>

802
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:10,180
<i>He's found the answer that we lost</i>

803
01:20:10,555 --> 01:20:14,017
<i>We're all weeping now
Weeping because</i>

804
01:20:14,559 --> 01:20:20,148
<i>There ain't nothing we can do
To protect you</i>

805
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:24,027
<i>O children</i>

806
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:31,701
<i>Lift up your voice</i>

807
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:37,374
<i>Lift up your voice</i>

808
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:39,751
<i>Children</i>

809
01:20:43,463 --> 01:20:49,219
<i>Rejoice, rejoice</i>

810
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:52,764
<i>Hey, little train, we're jumping on</i>

811
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:56,685
<i>The train that goes to the kingdom</i>

812
01:20:57,227 --> 01:21:00,397
<i>We're happy, Ma
We're having fun</i>

813
01:21:00,564 --> 01:21:04,693
<i>And the train ain't even left the station</i>

814
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:08,238
<i>Hey, little train, wait for me</i>

815
01:21:08,446 --> 01:21:12,284
<i>I once was blind but now I see</i>

816
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:15,787
<i>Have you left a seat for me?</i>

817
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:20,083
<i>Is that such a stretch of the imagination?</i>

818
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:23,587
<i>Hey, little train, wait for me</i>

819
01:21:23,753 --> 01:21:27,632
<i>I was held in chains but now I'm free</i>

820
01:21:27,924 --> 01:21:30,802
<i>I'm hanging in there
Don't you see?</i>

821
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:35,473
<i>In this process of elimination</i>

822
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,768
<i>Hey, little train, we're jumping on</i>

823
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:42,480
<i>The train that goes to the kingdom</i>

824
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:46,359
<i>We're happy, Ma
We're having fun</i>

825
01:21:46,526 --> 01:21:50,447
<i>It's beyond my wildest expectation</i>

826
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:53,825
<i>Hey, little train, we're jumping on</i>

827
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:57,662
<i>The train that goes to the kingdom</i>

828
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:01,374
<i>We're happy, Ma
We're having fun</i>

829
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:06,421
<i>The train ain't even left the station</i>

830
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:54,636
Hermione.

831
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:57,138
Hermione? You were right.

832
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:58,890
Snitches have flesh memories...

833
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:03,687
...but I didn't catch the first Snitch
with my hand, I almost swallowed it.

834
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:11,736
- "I open at the close."
- What do you think that means?

835
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:13,280
I don't know.

836
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:18,076
I found something as well.

837
01:23:24,457 --> 01:23:27,919
At first I thought it was an eye,
but now I don't think it is.

838
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:32,257
It isn't a rune, and it isn't anywhere
in Spellman's Syllabary.

839
01:23:32,757 --> 01:23:35,844
Somebody inked it in.
It isn't part of the book. Somebody drew it.

840
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:39,681
Luna's dad was wearing that
at Bill and Fleur's wedding.

841
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:45,729
Why would someone draw it
in a children's book?

842
01:23:48,315 --> 01:23:50,775
Look, Hermione, I've been thinking.

843
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:53,445
I want to go to Godric's Hollow.

844
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:56,656
It's where I was born.
It's where my parents died.

845
01:23:56,823 --> 01:24:00,452
That's exactly where he'll expect you to go
because it means something to you.

846
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:03,038
Yeah, but it means something to him too,
Hermione.

847
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:05,206
You-Know-Who almost died there.

848
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:10,045
I mean, isn't that exactly the type of place
he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux?

849
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:13,590
It's dangerous, Harry.

850
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:19,179
But even I have to admit, recently
I've been thinking we'll have to go there.

851
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:21,806
I think it's possible
something else is hidden there.

852
01:24:21,973 --> 01:24:23,475
What?

853
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:25,894
The sword.

854
01:24:26,478 --> 01:24:30,273
If Dumbledore wanted you to find it,
but didn't want it in the Ministry's hands...

855
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:34,652
...where better to hide it than
the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor?

856
01:24:35,987 --> 01:24:37,822
Hermione...

857
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:45,830
Don't ever let me
give you a haircut again.

858
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:09,729
I still think we should've used
Poly juice Potion.

859
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:11,439
No.

860
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:14,317
This is where I was born.

861
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:17,028
I'm not returning as someone else.

862
01:25:26,871 --> 01:25:29,874
Good night. Ha-ha-ha.

863
01:25:32,877 --> 01:25:35,672
Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve.

864
01:25:37,173 --> 01:25:38,466
Listen.

865
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:47,016
Do you think they'd be in there,
Hermione?

866
01:25:47,434 --> 01:25:49,436
My mom and dad.

867
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,652
Yeah, I think they would.

868
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:37,275
"lgnotus Peverell."

869
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,987
Hey, Harry?

870
01:27:18,858 --> 01:27:21,069
Merry Christmas, Hermione.

871
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:24,614
Merry Christmas, Harry.

872
01:27:44,467 --> 01:27:49,847
Harry, there's someone
watching us. By the church.

873
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:02,402
I think I know who that is.

874
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:05,697
I don't like this, Harry.

875
01:28:05,863 --> 01:28:10,910
Hermione, she knew
Dumbledore. She might have the sword.

876
01:28:29,762 --> 01:28:31,389
This is where they died, Hermione.

877
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,441
This is where he murdered them.

878
01:28:53,953 --> 01:28:55,913
You're Bathilda, aren't you?

879
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:03,588
Here, let me do that.

880
01:29:27,737 --> 01:29:31,616
Miss Bagshot, who is this man?

881
01:29:43,252 --> 01:29:44,921
Harry.

882
01:29:48,966 --> 01:29:50,802
<i>Lumos.</i>

883
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:32,236
Harry!

884
01:32:23,037 --> 01:32:24,121
<i>Confringo!</i>

885
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:09,000
Are you feeling better?

886
01:33:12,044 --> 01:33:14,505
You've outdone yourself this time,
Hermione.

887
01:33:14,672 --> 01:33:16,799
The Forest of Dean.

888
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:22,138
I came here once with Mom and Dad,
years ago.

889
01:33:22,763 --> 01:33:24,890
It's just how I remember it.

890
01:33:25,308 --> 01:33:29,228
The trees, the river, everything.

891
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:32,356
Like nothing's changed.

892
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:36,611
Not true, of course.
Everything's changed.

893
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:41,365
If I brought my parents back here now,
they probably wouldn't recognize any of it.

894
01:33:43,492 --> 01:33:47,622
Not the trees, not the river...

895
01:33:49,373 --> 01:33:51,542
...not even me.

896
01:33:56,672 --> 01:33:59,467
Maybe we should just stay here, Harry.

897
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:03,596
Grow old.

898
01:34:09,602 --> 01:34:12,897
You wanted to know
who the boy in the photograph was.

899
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:14,732
I know.

900
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:18,319
Gellert Grindelwald.

901
01:34:25,242 --> 01:34:28,663
He's the thief I saw
in Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.

902
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:32,083
Speaking of which, where is my wand?

903
01:34:33,417 --> 01:34:35,836
Where's my wand, Hermione?

904
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:48,974
As we were leaving Godric's Hollow,
I cast a curse and it rebounded.

905
01:34:51,727 --> 01:34:52,937
I'm sorry.

906
01:34:53,604 --> 01:34:56,273
- I tried to mend it, but wands are different.
- It's done.

907
01:34:58,234 --> 01:35:02,196
Leave me yours.
Go inside and get warm.

908
01:35:02,613 --> 01:35:04,949
I'll take the locket as well.

909
01:35:17,461 --> 01:35:18,838
<i>Trust me.</i>

910
01:36:44,590 --> 01:36:46,217
<i>Lumos.</i>

911
01:37:27,299 --> 01:37:28,676
<i>Accio sword.</i>

912
01:37:34,515 --> 01:37:36,433
<i>Diffindo.</i>

913
01:39:16,867 --> 01:39:20,037
- Hermione?
- Are you mental?

914
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:22,790
It was you?

915
01:39:22,956 --> 01:39:26,710
Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I think.

916
01:39:26,877 --> 01:39:28,712
And you cast the doe as well, did you?

917
01:39:29,254 --> 01:39:32,925
- No, I thought that was you.
- No, my Patronus is a stag.

918
01:39:33,092 --> 01:39:35,302
Right. Yeah. Antlers.

919
01:39:38,472 --> 01:39:41,642
Okay, Ron. Do it.

920
01:39:42,601 --> 01:39:46,355
I can't handle it. That thing affects me
more than it affects you and Hermione.

921
01:39:46,897 --> 01:39:49,525
- All the more reason.
- No. I can't.

922
01:39:49,692 --> 01:39:50,901
Then why are you here?

923
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:54,405
Why did you come back?

924
01:40:01,954 --> 01:40:06,083
Now, I'll have to speak to it in order for it
to open. When it does, don't hesitate.

925
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:09,253
I don't know what's in there,
but it'll put up a fight.

926
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:12,089
The bit of Riddle that was in that diary
tried to kill me.

927
01:40:14,591 --> 01:40:17,678
All right. One...

928
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:20,347
...two...

929
01:40:21,014 --> 01:40:22,933
...three.

930
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:38,282
<i>I have seen your heart, and it is mine.</i>

931
01:40:40,868 --> 01:40:44,788
<i>I have seen your dreams,
Ronald Weasley...</i>

932
01:40:44,955 --> 01:40:47,332
<i>...and I have seen your fears.</i>

933
01:40:49,042 --> 01:40:53,213
<i>Least loved by your mother,
who craved a daughter.</i>

934
01:40:53,839 --> 01:40:58,844
<i>Least loved by the girl
who prefers your friend.</i>

935
01:40:59,011 --> 01:41:01,764
Ron, kill it!

936
01:41:08,187 --> 01:41:10,898
We were better without you.

937
01:41:11,398 --> 01:41:13,150
Happier without you.

938
01:41:13,317 --> 01:41:18,655
Who could look at you
compared to Harry Potter?

939
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:23,243
What are you
compared with the Chosen One?

940
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:24,578
Ron, it's lying!

941
01:41:24,745 --> 01:41:27,748
Your mother confessed
she would have preferred me as a son.

942
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:30,918
What woman would take you?

943
01:41:31,126 --> 01:41:34,296
You are nothing.

944
01:41:34,463 --> 01:41:35,589
Nothing.

945
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:40,385
Nothing compared to him.

946
01:42:30,936 --> 01:42:32,604
Just think...

947
01:42:33,522 --> 01:42:35,607
...only three to go.

948
01:42:38,652 --> 01:42:40,404
Hermione?

949
01:42:42,656 --> 01:42:44,408
Hermione?

950
01:42:48,912 --> 01:42:50,872
Is everything all right?

951
01:42:51,498 --> 01:42:56,169
It's fine.
Actually, you know, it's more than fine.

952
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:02,217
Hey.

953
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:12,644
You complete ass, Ronald Weasley!

954
01:43:12,811 --> 01:43:16,481
You show up here after weeks,
and you say "hey"?

955
01:43:18,692 --> 01:43:21,445
- Where's my wand? Where's my wand?
- I don't know.

956
01:43:21,612 --> 01:43:23,864
- Harry Potter, give me my wand.
- I don't have it.

957
01:43:24,031 --> 01:43:27,868
- How come he's got your wand?
- Never mind why he's got my wand.

958
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:31,371
What is that?

959
01:43:34,291 --> 01:43:35,334
You destroyed it.

960
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:42,633
And how is it that you just happen
to have the sword of Gryffindor?

961
01:43:43,008 --> 01:43:44,968
It's a long story.

962
01:43:48,138 --> 01:43:52,267
- Don't think this changes anything.
- Oh, of course not.

963
01:43:52,434 --> 01:43:55,687
I only just destroyed a bloody Horcrux.
Why would that change anything?

964
01:43:55,854 --> 01:43:59,941
Look, I wanted to come back
as soon as I left.

965
01:44:00,108 --> 01:44:03,528
- I just didn't know how to find you.
- Yeah, how did you find us?

966
01:44:03,695 --> 01:44:06,782
With this. It doesn't just turn off lights.

967
01:44:06,948 --> 01:44:11,828
I don't know how it works, but Christmas
morning I was sleeping in this little pub...

968
01:44:11,995 --> 01:44:14,456
...keeping away from some Snatchers...

969
01:44:14,873 --> 01:44:16,166
...and I heard it.

970
01:44:16,541 --> 01:44:18,001
It?

971
01:44:19,336 --> 01:44:21,254
A voice...

972
01:44:22,839 --> 01:44:24,049
...your voice, Hermione...

973
01:44:25,217 --> 01:44:26,843
...coming out of it.

974
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:30,847
- And what exactly did I say, may I ask?
- My name.

975
01:44:31,473 --> 01:44:33,517
Just my name.

976
01:44:34,267 --> 01:44:36,353
Like a whisper.

977
01:44:38,355 --> 01:44:44,361
So I took it, clicked it,
and this tiny ball of light appeared.

978
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:46,238
And I knew.

979
01:44:46,822 --> 01:44:51,451
And sure enough, it floated toward me,
the ball of light...

980
01:44:53,161 --> 01:44:57,374
...went right to my chest,
straight through me. Right here.

981
01:44:58,542 --> 01:45:02,546
And I knew it was gonna take me
where I needed to go, so I Disapparated...

982
01:45:02,713 --> 01:45:05,006
...and came to this hillside.

983
01:45:05,549 --> 01:45:08,051
It was dark. I had no idea where I was.

984
01:45:08,593 --> 01:45:11,430
I just hoped
that one of you would show yourself.

985
01:45:12,347 --> 01:45:13,890
And you did.

986
01:45:31,283 --> 01:45:34,202
I've always liked these flames
Hermione makes.

987
01:45:38,248 --> 01:45:40,792
How long do you reckon
she'll stay mad at me?

988
01:45:42,335 --> 01:45:45,672
Well, just keep talking about that
little ball of light touching your heart...

989
01:45:45,839 --> 01:45:47,257
...and she'll come round.

990
01:45:47,424 --> 01:45:50,177
It was true. Every word.

991
01:45:51,970 --> 01:45:54,347
This is gonna sound crazy...

992
01:45:54,806 --> 01:45:59,186
...but I think that's why Dumbledore
left it to me, the Deluminator.

993
01:45:59,686 --> 01:46:04,691
I think he knew that somehow I'd need it
to find my way back, and she'd lead me.

994
01:46:07,569 --> 01:46:10,280
Bloody hell, I just realized,
you need a wand, don't you?

995
01:46:10,447 --> 01:46:12,949
- Yeah.
- I've got one here.

996
01:46:13,241 --> 01:46:15,827
It's a blackthorn. Ten inches.

997
01:46:15,994 --> 01:46:19,623
Nothing special, but I reckon it'll do.

998
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:22,834
Took if off a Snatcher
a couple of weeks ago.

999
01:46:23,335 --> 01:46:27,172
Don't tell Hermione this,
but they're a bit dim, Snatchers.

1000
01:46:27,464 --> 01:46:30,383
This one was definitely part troll,
the smell of him.

1001
01:46:30,550 --> 01:46:31,593
<i>Engorgio.</i>

1002
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,929
- <i>Reducio!</i>
- What's going on in there?

1003
01:46:34,095 --> 01:46:35,347
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

1004
01:46:37,724 --> 01:46:39,351
We need to talk.

1005
01:46:40,143 --> 01:46:41,353
Yeah, all right.

1006
01:46:48,318 --> 01:46:51,863
- I want to go see Xenophilius Lovegood.
- Sorry?

1007
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:55,283
See this?

1008
01:46:55,450 --> 01:46:59,329
It's a letter Dumbledore wrote
to Grindelwald. Look at the signature.

1009
01:47:00,539 --> 01:47:02,749
It's the mark again.

1010
01:47:03,667 --> 01:47:05,836
It keeps cropping up.

1011
01:47:06,002 --> 01:47:10,340
In <i>Beedle the Bard,</i>
in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow.

1012
01:47:11,174 --> 01:47:13,051
It was there too.

1013
01:47:13,218 --> 01:47:16,847
- Where?
- Outside Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.

1014
01:47:17,264 --> 01:47:18,515
But what does it mean?

1015
01:47:18,682 --> 01:47:23,478
Look, you've got no idea where
the next Horcrux is, and neither do I...

1016
01:47:25,188 --> 01:47:28,108
...but this, this means something.

1017
01:47:28,441 --> 01:47:31,862
- I'm sure of it.
- Yeah. Hermione's right.

1018
01:47:32,863 --> 01:47:34,990
We ought to see Lovegood.

1019
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:39,202
Let's vote on it. Those in favor?

1020
01:48:03,059 --> 01:48:05,687
You're not still mad at him, are you?

1021
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:08,231
I'm always mad at him.

1022
01:48:11,026 --> 01:48:12,527
Luna.

1023
01:48:12,694 --> 01:48:14,404
Luna.

1024
01:48:22,078 --> 01:48:24,915
"Keep off the dirigible plums."

1025
01:48:33,924 --> 01:48:36,635
What is it? Who are you?

1026
01:48:36,927 --> 01:48:37,969
What do you want?

1027
01:48:38,136 --> 01:48:42,766
Hello, Mr. Lovegood. I'm Harry Potter.
We met a few months ago.

1028
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:48,647
Could we come in?

1029
01:48:52,442 --> 01:48:55,028
- Where is Luna?
- Luna?

1030
01:48:56,279 --> 01:48:58,281
She'll be along.

1031
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:13,838
So how can I help you, Mr. Potter?

1032
01:49:14,673 --> 01:49:17,717
Well, actually...

1033
01:49:18,718 --> 01:49:23,264
It was about something you were wearing
round your neck at the wedding. A symbol.

1034
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:26,685
You mean this?

1035
01:49:27,102 --> 01:49:28,687
Yes.

1036
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:30,855
That exactly.

1037
01:49:31,523 --> 01:49:35,485
What we've wondered is, what is it?

1038
01:49:35,652 --> 01:49:37,487
What is it?

1039
01:49:37,654 --> 01:49:40,657
Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows,
of course.

1040
01:49:40,824 --> 01:49:41,908
- The what?
- The what?

1041
01:49:42,075 --> 01:49:44,160
The Deathly Hallows.

1042
01:49:44,327 --> 01:49:47,414
I assume you're all familiar with
"The Tale of the Three Brothers."

1043
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:48,999
- Yes.
- No.

1044
01:49:54,421 --> 01:49:56,172
I have it in here.

1045
01:50:07,434 --> 01:50:09,060
"There were once three brothers...

1046
01:50:09,227 --> 01:50:13,648
...who were traveling along a lonely,
winding road at twilight."

1047
01:50:13,815 --> 01:50:16,526
Midnight. Mom always said "midnight."

1048
01:50:21,531 --> 01:50:25,410
But "twilight's" fine. Better, actually.

1049
01:50:27,704 --> 01:50:29,539
Do you want to read it?

1050
01:50:29,706 --> 01:50:31,916
No. It's fine.

1051
01:50:33,835 --> 01:50:35,754
<i>"There were once three brothers...</i>

1052
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:41,134
<i>...who were traveling along a lonely,
winding road at twilight.</i>

1053
01:50:43,011 --> 01:50:48,308
<i>In time, the brothers reached a river
too treacherous to pass.</i>

1054
01:50:48,641 --> 01:50:50,518
<i>But being learned in the magical arts...</i>

1055
01:50:50,685 --> 01:50:55,857
<i>...the three brothers simply
waved their wands and made a bridge.</i>

1056
01:50:57,192 --> 01:50:59,277
<i>Before they could cross, however...</i>

1057
01:50:59,444 --> 01:51:03,573
<i>...they found their path blocked
by a hooded figure.</i>

1058
01:51:03,823 --> 01:51:07,702
<i>It was Death, and he felt cheated.</i>

1059
01:51:07,869 --> 01:51:10,914
<i>Cheated because travelers would
normally drown in the river.</i>

1060
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:13,166
<i>But Death was cunning.</i>

1061
01:51:13,792 --> 01:51:16,795
<i>He pretended to congratulate
the three brothers on their magic...</i>

1062
01:51:16,961 --> 01:51:22,258
<i>...and said that each had earned a prize for
having been clever enough to evade him.</i>

1063
01:51:22,801 --> 01:51:27,388
<i>The oldest asked for a wand
more powerful than any in existence.</i>

1064
01:51:27,555 --> 01:51:32,143
<i>So Death fashioned him one
from an elder tree that stood nearby.</i>

1065
01:51:33,561 --> 01:51:37,857
<i>The second brother decided he wanted
to humiliate Death even further...</i>

1066
01:51:38,024 --> 01:51:42,445
<i>...and asked for the power
to recall loved ones from the grave.</i>

1067
01:51:42,904 --> 01:51:47,200
<i>So Death plucked a stone from the river
and offered it to him.</i>

1068
01:51:47,951 --> 01:51:51,913
<i>Finally,
Death turned to the third brother.</i>

1069
01:51:53,123 --> 01:51:54,541
<i>A humble man...</i>

1070
01:51:54,707 --> 01:51:58,920
<i>...he asked for something that would
allow him to go forth from that place...</i>

1071
01:51:59,087 --> 01:52:02,257
<i>...without being followed by Death.</i>

1072
01:52:03,341 --> 01:52:09,222
<i>And so it was that Death reluctantly
handed over his own Cloak of invisibility.</i>

1073
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:15,520
<i>The first brother traveled
to a distant village...</i>

1074
01:52:15,687 --> 01:52:17,814
<i>...where, with the Elder Wand in hand...</i>

1075
01:52:17,981 --> 01:52:21,734
<i>...he killed a wizard
with whom he had once quarreled.</i>

1076
01:52:23,945 --> 01:52:27,490
<i>Drunk with the power
that the Elder Wand had given him...</i>

1077
01:52:27,657 --> 01:52:30,743
<i>...he bragged of his invincibility.</i>

1078
01:52:33,746 --> 01:52:37,208
<i>But that night,
another wizard stole the wand...</i>

1079
01:52:37,375 --> 01:52:40,503
<i>...and slit the brother's throat
for good measure.</i>

1080
01:52:40,712 --> 01:52:44,174
<i>And so Death took the first brother
for his own.</i>

1081
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:46,843
<i>The second brother journeyed
to his home...</i>

1082
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:50,013
<i>...where he took the stone
and turned it thrice in hand.</i>

1083
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:54,642
<i>To his delight, the girl he'd once hoped
to marry before her untimely death...</i>

1084
01:52:54,809 --> 01:52:57,187
<i>...appeared before him.</i>

1085
01:52:57,687 --> 01:53:02,984
<i>Yet, soon she turned sad and cold
for she did not belong in the mortal world.</i>

1086
01:53:03,151 --> 01:53:04,777
<i>Driven mad with hopeless longing...</i>

1087
01:53:04,944 --> 01:53:08,239
<i>...the second brother killed himself
so as to join her.</i>

1088
01:53:09,449 --> 01:53:12,535
<i>And so Death took the second brother.</i>

1089
01:53:12,702 --> 01:53:14,370
<i>As for the third brother...</i>

1090
01:53:14,537 --> 01:53:18,750
<i>...Death searched for many years
but was never able to find him.</i>

1091
01:53:18,917 --> 01:53:21,836
<i>Only when he attained a great age
did the youngest brother...</i>

1092
01:53:22,003 --> 01:53:26,257
<i>...shed the Cloak of invisibility
and give it to his son.</i>

1093
01:53:27,508 --> 01:53:31,638
<i>He then greeted Death as an old friend
and went with him gladly...</i>

1094
01:53:31,804 --> 01:53:34,974
<i>...departing this life as equals."</i>

1095
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:41,564
So there you are.
Those are the Deathly Hallows.

1096
01:53:42,941 --> 01:53:46,027
I'm sorry, sir.
I still don't quite understand.

1097
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:53,743
Where's that pen I had?

1098
01:54:04,712 --> 01:54:05,964
The Elder Wand.

1099
01:54:07,090 --> 01:54:10,760
The most powerful wand ever made.

1100
01:54:21,145 --> 01:54:23,439
The Resurrection Stone.

1101
01:54:34,325 --> 01:54:38,121
The Cloak of Invisibility.

1102
01:54:40,123 --> 01:54:43,293
Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.

1103
01:54:43,543 --> 01:54:49,007
Together, they make one
master of Death.

1104
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:57,890
That mark was on a grave
in Godric's Hollow.

1105
01:54:58,975 --> 01:55:01,644
Uh, Mr. Lovegood,
does the Peverell Family...

1106
01:55:01,811 --> 01:55:03,646
...have anything to do
with the Deathly Hallows?

1107
01:55:03,813 --> 01:55:06,649
Uh-- Uh--

1108
01:55:06,816 --> 01:55:10,570
Ignotus-- Excuse me. --and his brothers,
Cadmus and Antioch...

1109
01:55:10,737 --> 01:55:13,406
...are thought to be the original owners
of the Hallows...

1110
01:55:13,573 --> 01:55:18,453
...and therefore the inspiration
for the story. Uh-- Uh--

1111
01:55:18,619 --> 01:55:21,122
But your tea's gone cold.

1112
01:55:22,332 --> 01:55:24,334
I'll be right back.

1113
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:26,336
Let's go down here.

1114
01:55:28,212 --> 01:55:29,714
Let's get out of here.

1115
01:55:29,881 --> 01:55:32,759
I'm not drinking any more of that stuff,
hot or cold.

1116
01:55:39,057 --> 01:55:41,017
Thank you, sir.

1117
01:55:41,934 --> 01:55:44,979
- You forgot the water.
- Water?

1118
01:55:45,146 --> 01:55:46,564
For the tea.

1119
01:55:46,731 --> 01:55:49,317
Did--? Did I?

1120
01:55:51,235 --> 01:55:53,404
How silly of me.

1121
01:55:55,031 --> 01:55:57,283
It's no matter.
We really should be going anyway.

1122
01:55:57,450 --> 01:55:59,535
No, you can't!

1123
01:56:03,706 --> 01:56:05,416
Sir?

1124
01:56:12,799 --> 01:56:15,385
You're my only hope.

1125
01:56:19,263 --> 01:56:23,643
They were angry, you see,
about what I'd been writing.

1126
01:56:26,687 --> 01:56:28,815
So they took her.

1127
01:56:30,274 --> 01:56:33,069
They took my Luna.

1128
01:56:34,737 --> 01:56:36,406
My Luna.

1129
01:56:48,876 --> 01:56:51,754
But it's really you they want.

1130
01:56:54,006 --> 01:56:56,092
Who took her, sir?

1131
01:57:01,222 --> 01:57:02,473
Voldemort.

1132
01:57:13,109 --> 01:57:15,445
Stop! I've got him!

1133
01:57:32,712 --> 01:57:36,632
That treacherous little bleeder.
Is there no one we can trust?

1134
01:57:36,799 --> 01:57:39,093
They kidnapped her
because he supported me.

1135
01:57:39,260 --> 01:57:41,387
He was just desperate.

1136
01:57:41,929 --> 01:57:44,140
I'll do the enchantments.

1137
01:57:55,818 --> 01:57:57,236
Hello, beautiful.

1138
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:06,329
Well, don't hang about, snatch them.

1139
01:59:17,566 --> 01:59:19,068
<i>Harry.</i>

1140
01:59:19,235 --> 01:59:22,238
<i>Tell me, Grindelwald.
Tell me where it is.</i>

1141
01:59:22,822 --> 01:59:26,909
<i>Grindelwald. Grindelwald. Grindelwald.</i>

1142
01:59:27,618 --> 01:59:31,080
Hello, Tom.
I knew you would come one day...

1143
01:59:31,580 --> 01:59:35,543
...but surely you must know
I no longer have what you seek.

1144
01:59:36,168 --> 01:59:39,213
- Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where it is.
- Ha-ha-ha.

1145
01:59:39,380 --> 01:59:40,756
Tell me who possesses it.

1146
01:59:40,923 --> 01:59:46,053
The Elder Wand lies with him,
of course...

1147
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:48,472
...buried in the earth.

1148
01:59:49,432 --> 01:59:50,766
Dumbledore.

1149
01:59:59,775 --> 02:00:01,652
The Hallows exist...

1150
02:00:01,819 --> 02:00:05,614
...but he's only after one of them,
the last one. He knows where it is.

1151
02:00:05,781 --> 02:00:09,618
He's gonna have it by the end of the night.
You-Know-Who's found the Elder Wand.

1152
02:00:09,785 --> 02:00:12,288
- Don't touch her. Unh!
- Leave him.

1153
02:00:12,455 --> 02:00:13,706
Your boyfriend will get worse than that...

1154
02:00:13,873 --> 02:00:14,999
Get off me.

1155
02:00:15,166 --> 02:00:17,918
...if he doesn't learn to behave himself.

1156
02:00:21,130 --> 02:00:22,631
What happened to you, ugly?

1157
02:00:24,342 --> 02:00:26,218
No, not you.

1158
02:00:27,636 --> 02:00:30,681
- What's your name?
- Dudley. Vernon Dudley.

1159
02:00:30,848 --> 02:00:33,059
Check it.

1160
02:00:34,643 --> 02:00:36,979
And you, my lovely...

1161
02:00:40,316 --> 02:00:42,318
...what do they call you?

1162
02:00:43,736 --> 02:00:47,823
Penelope Clearwater, half-blood.

1163
02:00:50,910 --> 02:00:52,828
There's no Vernon Dudley on here.

1164
02:00:53,913 --> 02:00:57,166
Did you hear that, ugly?
The list says you're lying.

1165
02:00:57,333 --> 02:00:59,543
How come you don't want us
to know who you are?

1166
02:00:59,710 --> 02:01:02,380
The list's wrong. I told you who I am.

1167
02:01:18,354 --> 02:01:20,439
Change of plan.

1168
02:01:21,524 --> 02:01:24,777
We're not taking this lot to the Ministry.

1169
02:02:04,442 --> 02:02:08,070
Get Draco.

1170
02:02:12,575 --> 02:02:14,118
Well?

1171
02:02:17,246 --> 02:02:21,750
- I can't be sure.
- Draco. Look closely, son.

1172
02:02:22,751 --> 02:02:27,840
If we are the ones
to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord...

1173
02:02:28,007 --> 02:02:33,262
...everything would be forgiven.
All would be as it was, you understand?

1174
02:02:33,429 --> 02:02:37,558
Now, we won't be forgetting who
actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy.

1175
02:02:37,725 --> 02:02:40,144
You dare to
talk to me like that in my own house?

1176
02:02:40,311 --> 02:02:42,104
Lucius.

1177
02:02:45,024 --> 02:02:48,861
Don't be shy, sweetie. Come over.

1178
02:02:50,362 --> 02:02:55,117
Now, if this isn't who we think it is, Draco,
and we call him, he'll kill us all.

1179
02:02:55,284 --> 02:02:58,120
We need to be absolutely sure.

1180
02:02:58,412 --> 02:02:59,413
What's wrong with his face?

1181
02:02:59,580 --> 02:03:01,290
Yes, what is wrong with his face?

1182
02:03:01,457 --> 02:03:03,125
He came to us like that.

1183
02:03:03,375 --> 02:03:04,793
Something he picked up in the forest,
I reckon.

1184
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:08,672
Or ran into a Stinging Jinx.
Was it you, dearie?

1185
02:03:13,802 --> 02:03:16,555
Give me her wand.
We'll see what her last spell was.

1186
02:03:17,806 --> 02:03:19,308
Ah.

1187
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:20,643
Got you.

1188
02:03:23,812 --> 02:03:25,523
What is that?

1189
02:03:27,483 --> 02:03:29,068
Where'd you get that from?

1190
02:03:29,235 --> 02:03:32,738
It was in her bag when we searched her.
Reckon it's mine now.

1191
02:03:36,492 --> 02:03:37,826
Are you mad?

1192
02:03:46,126 --> 02:03:48,963
Go! Get out!

1193
02:03:54,677 --> 02:03:58,764
Cissy, put the boys in the cellar.

1194
02:03:58,931 --> 02:04:04,311
I want to have a little conversation
with this one, girl-to-girl.

1195
02:04:13,362 --> 02:04:16,448
What are we gonna do?
We can't leave Hermione alone with her.

1196
02:04:16,615 --> 02:04:17,992
Ron?

1197
02:04:23,205 --> 02:04:24,748
Harry?

1198
02:04:30,462 --> 02:04:32,047
Luna?

1199
02:04:32,631 --> 02:04:36,802
That sword is meant to be in my vault
at Gringotts. How did you get it?

1200
02:04:36,969 --> 02:04:40,097
What else did you and your friends take
from my vault?!

1201
02:04:40,264 --> 02:04:45,644
I didn't take anything. Please.
I didn't take anything.

1202
02:04:45,811 --> 02:04:47,354
I don't believe it.

1203
02:04:52,901 --> 02:04:54,028
We have to do something.

1204
02:04:54,194 --> 02:04:58,240
There's no way out of here.
We've tried everything. It's enchanted.

1205
02:04:58,407 --> 02:05:01,076
- Please! please!
- Shut up!

1206
02:05:01,243 --> 02:05:03,078
You're bleeding, Harry.

1207
02:05:03,245 --> 02:05:05,247
That's a curious thing
to keep in your sock.

1208
02:05:14,506 --> 02:05:15,633
Help us.

1209
02:05:21,430 --> 02:05:23,307
- Let her go.
- Shut up. Get back.

1210
02:05:24,642 --> 02:05:28,854
You, goblin, come with me.

1211
02:05:48,499 --> 02:05:50,000
- Aah!
- Dobby?

1212
02:05:50,876 --> 02:05:52,294
What are you doing here?

1213
02:05:52,461 --> 02:05:54,713
Dobby has come to rescue
Harry Potter, of course.

1214
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:57,341
Dobby will always be there
for Harry Potter.

1215
02:05:57,508 --> 02:06:01,136
You can Apparate in and out of this room?
Could you take us with you?

1216
02:06:01,303 --> 02:06:03,055
Of course, sir. I'm an elf.

1217
02:06:03,847 --> 02:06:05,724
Works for me.

1218
02:06:05,974 --> 02:06:08,310
Dobby, I want you to take Luna
and Mr. Ollivander--

1219
02:06:08,477 --> 02:06:10,938
Shell Cottage
on the outskirts of Tinworth.

1220
02:06:11,313 --> 02:06:12,314
Trust me.

1221
02:06:13,148 --> 02:06:14,566
Whenever you're ready, sir.

1222
02:06:15,275 --> 02:06:17,986
Sir? I like her very much.

1223
02:06:22,908 --> 02:06:26,203
Meet me at the top of the stairs
in 10 seconds.

1224
02:06:35,295 --> 02:06:37,047
Ow.

1225
02:06:42,469 --> 02:06:44,680
Who gets his wand?

1226
02:06:47,433 --> 02:06:51,437
I'm only going to
ask you once more, goblin.

1227
02:06:51,603 --> 02:06:55,023
Think very, very carefully
before you answer.

1228
02:06:55,357 --> 02:06:56,942
I don't know.

1229
02:06:57,109 --> 02:07:00,320
You don't know?
Why weren't you doing your job?

1230
02:07:00,487 --> 02:07:03,699
Who got into my vault?

1231
02:07:04,992 --> 02:07:09,413
Who stole it? Who stole it? Well?

1232
02:07:09,580 --> 02:07:13,625
When I was last in your vault,
the sword was there.

1233
02:07:16,378 --> 02:07:19,590
Oh, well, then perhaps
it just walked out on its own then.

1234
02:07:19,757 --> 02:07:22,217
There is no place safer than Gringotts.

1235
02:07:22,384 --> 02:07:23,761
Liar!

1236
02:07:25,721 --> 02:07:29,141
Consider yourself lucky, goblin.

1237
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:34,980
The same won't be said for this one.

1238
02:07:35,147 --> 02:07:36,899
Like hell.

1239
02:07:37,649 --> 02:07:38,901
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1240
02:07:40,319 --> 02:07:41,403
<i>Stupefy.</i>

1241
02:07:45,574 --> 02:07:46,909
Stop!

1242
02:07:48,076 --> 02:07:49,661
Drop your wands.

1243
02:07:52,539 --> 02:07:53,582
I said, drop them!

1244
02:07:55,083 --> 02:07:56,502
Pick them up, Draco, now.

1245
02:07:57,377 --> 02:07:58,545
Well, well, well...

1246
02:07:59,296 --> 02:08:01,507
...look what we have here.

1247
02:08:03,091 --> 02:08:04,593
It's Harry Potter.

1248
02:08:05,385 --> 02:08:11,767
He's all bright and shiny and new again,
just in time for the Dark Lord.

1249
02:08:11,934 --> 02:08:13,936
Call him.

1250
02:08:17,689 --> 02:08:19,483
Call him.

1251
02:08:54,685 --> 02:08:56,520
<i>Stupefy!</i>

1252
02:08:57,312 --> 02:08:58,981
Stupid elf.

1253
02:08:59,147 --> 02:09:02,192
- You could've killed me.
- Dobby never meant to kill.

1254
02:09:02,359 --> 02:09:06,405
Dobby only meant to maim
or seriously injure.

1255
02:09:08,699 --> 02:09:12,035
How dare you take a witch's wand?

1256
02:09:12,202 --> 02:09:15,205
How dare you defy your masters?

1257
02:09:15,372 --> 02:09:18,500
Dobby has no master.

1258
02:09:18,667 --> 02:09:21,169
Dobby is a free elf.

1259
02:09:21,336 --> 02:09:26,300
And Dobby has come
to save Harry Potter and his friends.

1260
02:09:56,163 --> 02:09:57,831
Hermione.

1261
02:09:57,998 --> 02:10:00,500
You're all right. We're safe.

1262
02:10:00,667 --> 02:10:02,711
We're all safe.

1263
02:10:03,545 --> 02:10:05,756
Harry Potter.

1264
02:10:09,509 --> 02:10:11,345
Dobby.

1265
02:10:21,855 --> 02:10:24,900
Dobby. No, just-- Hold on.

1266
02:10:25,067 --> 02:10:29,404
Hold on. Look, just hold on, okay?

1267
02:10:29,571 --> 02:10:31,656
We'll fix you.

1268
02:10:32,074 --> 02:10:34,826
Hermione will have something.

1269
02:10:34,993 --> 02:10:37,329
In your bag. Hermione?

1270
02:10:38,955 --> 02:10:40,290
Hermione?

1271
02:10:42,501 --> 02:10:45,629
What is it? Help me.

1272
02:10:48,215 --> 02:10:51,343
Such a beautiful place...

1273
02:10:53,512 --> 02:10:55,764
...to be with friends.

1274
02:10:57,599 --> 02:11:02,979
Dobby is happy to be with his friend...

1275
02:11:05,399 --> 02:11:07,818
...Harry Potter.

1276
02:11:28,630 --> 02:11:31,007
We should close his eyes.

1277
02:11:31,258 --> 02:11:33,301
Don't you think?

1278
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:39,808
There.

1279
02:11:40,267 --> 02:11:42,686
Now he could be sleeping.

1280
02:11:57,993 --> 02:12:00,078
I want to bury him.

1281
02:12:01,121 --> 02:12:04,666
Properly. Without magic.
