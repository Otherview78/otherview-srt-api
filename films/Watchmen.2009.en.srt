1
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:25,609
Man: Wrong, as usual.

2
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,029
The United States' lack of action
in Eastern Europe

3
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:33,575
proves that the Soviet union's
aggression at the Afghan border

4
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,120
will not be opposed publicly
by the United States.

5
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,708
Issue: The Soviet union continued

6
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,211
its recent series
of military exercises

7
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,631
conducting a bomb test today
in the Bering sea

8
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:51,802
just 1, 500 miles
off the southern coast of Alaska.

9
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:56,265
President Richard Nixon
issued this warning to the Soviets:

10
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:59,935
Nixon: The United States
does not start fights.

11
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:03,814
Let it be clear.
We maintain our strength

12
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,857
in order to maintain peace.

13
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:10,654
So any adversary
should ask themselves:

14
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,991
"Do the consequences
of attacking america

15
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,702
"outweigh the potential benefits?"

16
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,580
As a result of the Soviet activity,

17
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:22,457
the watchdog group
of nuclear scientists

18
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:27,004
moved the doomsday clock
up to five minutes until midnight:

19
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:32,551
Destruction by nuclear war.

20
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,136
Question:

21
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,639
On a scale of zero to 10,
zero meaning impossibility,

22
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,225
10 meaning complete
metaphysical certitude

23
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,893
what are the chances

24
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,980
the Russians will actually attack
the United States?

25
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,523
Pat Buchanan.

26
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:47,858
Zero.

27
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,777
The Soviets
would never risk going to war

28
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:54,656
when we have a walking
nuclear deterrent on our side.

29
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,284
You're referring, of course,
to dr Manhattan,

30
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:01,830
but does dr Manhattan's existence
guarantee world peace? Eleanor clift.

31
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,583
Well, it hasn't
stopped the Soviet union

32
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:09,296
from stockpiling record amounts
of nuclear weapons.

33
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,173
You don't think
it's all just posturing?

34
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:15,802
Maybe the reason why the Soviets
are doing these, er, bomb tests

35
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:20,140
is because they feel threatened
by dr Manhattan, cornered.

36
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:23,727
Maybe the whole world feels like that.

37
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,398
Soviet ships have violated
the territorial waters...

38
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,020
Just a matter of time, I suppose.

39
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,947
It's a joke. It's all a joke.

40
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,825
Mother, forgive me.

41
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,652
Sally: I was a hero, goddamn it!

42
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,323
Man: An act clearly meant
to send a signal

43
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,992
to the government in Saigon

44
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:58,872
that violence and oppression
is not the way to peace. Reaction...

45
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,327
Man: Fuck you, pigs!

46
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,735
Man: Good luck, mr gorsky.

47
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,534
Man: Get out of here, vigilantes!

48
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:43,536
Gallagher: Edward Blake, 67 years old,
six-two, a solid 225.

49
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,872
Guy was built like a linebacker.

50
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,290
Fine: Yeah, I saw the body.

51
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,210
For a guy his age,
he was in terrific shape.

52
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,128
Gallagher: You mean
apart from being dead?

53
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,757
That's plate glass.

54
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,384
You'd have to step on the gas
just to put a crack in it.

55
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,386
Had to have been thrown.

56
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,555
Check the bedroom?

57
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,600
Yeah. Drawers opened, tossed through.

58
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,770
Mattress flipped. Probably robbery.

59
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,480
Or made to look like one.

60
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,606
See this?

61
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,651
Shaking hands with the president.

62
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,777
Fine: Whoa.

63
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,570
Think Blake was a spook?

64
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,324
Government or black ops?

65
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,493
Gallagher: I think...

66
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,205
This is way bigger than both of us.

67
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,463
Rorschach: Rorschach's journal,
October 12th, 1985.

68
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:40,843
Dog carcass in alley this morning.
Tyre tread on burst stomach.

69
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,097
This city's afraid of me.

70
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,599
I've seen its true face.

71
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,726
The streets are extended gutters,

72
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,603
and the gutters are full of blood.

73
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,523
And when the drains finally scab over,

74
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,359
all the vermin will drown.

75
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,029
The accumulated filth of all their sex
and murder

76
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,448
will foam up around their waists

77
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:07,412
and all the whores and politicians
will look up and shout, "save us."

78
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,125
And I'll whisper, "no."

79
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,338
Now the whole world
stands on the brink

80
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,799
staring down into bloody hell.

81
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,428
All those liberals
and intellectuals

82
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,638
and smooth talkers

83
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,517
and all of a sudden,
nobody can think of anything to say.

84
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,186
Beneath me, this awful city.

85
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,524
It screams like an abattoir
full of retarded children

86
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:41,529
and the night reeks of fornication
and bad consciences.

87
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,851
Huh.

88
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,822
Tonight, a comedian died in New York.

89
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,865
Somebody knows why.

90
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,618
Somebody knows.

91
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,292
No, I definitely heard something.

92
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,839
Watch the door.

93
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,532
Shh.

94
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,452
Must've been the wind.
Next time you...

95
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,469
Man: It all started with the gangs.

96
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,180
You know, people tend to forget that.

97
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,933
Pirate outfits, ghosts.

98
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,520
They thought it was funny:
Dress up and pull heists.

99
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,900
Of course, as soon as we'd arrest
them, they'd be back on the street.

100
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,987
Nobody could pick them out of a lineup
because of the damn masks.

101
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,448
So a few of us cops,
we get together,

102
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,910
and we figure, what the heck,
we'll mask up, too.

103
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,829
We'll finish what the law couldn't.

104
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,041
Pretty soon,
the papers get wind of it.

105
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,751
They ran with it,

106
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,546
and oh, boy,
we're a national pastime.

107
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,008
It was me, dollar bill, mothman,

108
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,553
captain Metropolis, hooded justice,

109
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:56,015
silk spectre and the comedian.

110
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:59,769
Oh, don't get me started on him.

111
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:06,067
I must be drunk already,
telling you this sob story again.

112
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,860
I think you were trying
to make a point.

113
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:12,698
Well, my point is
that we had it too easy.

114
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:14,951
It wasn't fair what
happened to you guys.

115
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,203
You guys who picked up
where we left off,

116
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,247
with Nixon forcing you out.

117
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,041
Nixon, oh, that prick.

118
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,710
And to think I voted
for that prick five times.

119
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,671
Hey, it was him or the commies, right?

120
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,511
Oh, wow, it's almost midnight.
Gotta go.

121
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,931
Truth?

122
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:41,602
You were a better nite owl
than I ever was, Danny boy.

123
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,064
- Hollis, we both know that's bullshit.
- Hey.

124
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,108
Watch with the language.

125
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,027
This is the left hook
that floored captain axis, remember?

126
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,779
- Yeah.
- Woman: This just in.

127
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,698
The masked vigilante
known as rorschach

128
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,118
has assaulted a police officer
in the early-morning hours.

129
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,371
Rorschach is on the FBI's
ten most wanted list

130
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,290
for violation of the keene act,

131
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,542
which banned
masked heroes six years ago.

132
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,461
Rorschach reportedly incapacitated
an officer by...

133
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,006
Forced everyone out except him.

134
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,674
Oh, he'll quit.

135
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,050
When he's dead.

136
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,970
- Next week?
- Hollis: Well...

137
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:19,932
You know, you don't have to
keep humouring me like this.

138
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,977
If you got a hot date or something...

139
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,855
Hey, us retired guys
have to stick together, right?

140
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,483
You ever miss it?

141
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,445
No. You?

142
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:34,989
No. Heck, no.

143
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,034
Be seeing you.

144
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,317
Hello, Daniel.

145
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,111
Rorschach.

146
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:59,281
Helped myself to some beans.
Hope you don't mind.

147
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,868
No, no. Course not.

148
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,914
You want me to heat those up for you?

149
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,958
Fine like this.

150
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,794
How have you been keeping?

151
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,883
Rorschach: Out of prison.

152
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:20,928
Heard about you on the news.

153
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,098
Say you attacked a cop.

154
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,601
Rorschach: Minor wound.
Won't need hospitalisation.

155
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,063
Daniel, look at this.

156
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,572
Dan: Is this bean juice?
Rorschach: Human bean juice.

157
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:44,368
Badge belonged to the comedian.
Blood too. He's dead.

158
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,247
Let's talk downstairs.

159
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,175
Dan: It could have been a burglary.

160
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,094
Maybe the killer didn't know
who the comedian was.

161
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:06,515
Rorschach: An ordinary burglar?
Kill the comedian? Ridiculous.

162
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,312
I heard he'd been working
for the government since '77

163
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,232
knocking over marxist republics
in South America.

164
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:18,277
Maybe it was a political killing
or something.

165
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,820
Maybe.

166
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:23,199
Maybe someone's picking off
costumed heroes.

167
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,409
Dan: You don't think
that's a little paranoid?

168
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,162
That what they say about me now?

169
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,580
Paranoid?

170
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,708
Dan: Look, comedian made
a lot of enemies over the years,

171
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,376
even among his friends.

172
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,504
Rorschach: Speaking of friends,
how's Hollis Mason?

173
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,340
He wrote that book.

174
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,342
Said some bad things
about the comedian in it.

175
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:45,554
I don't like what you're implying,
and I like being followed even less.

176
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:50,684
Maybe I was keeping an eye on you,
in case someone's gunning for masks.

177
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:54,814
- You were never that sentimental.
- Attack on one is attack on all of us.

178
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,298
What do you suggest we do about it?

179
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,361
Retribution.

180
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:05,032
- Watchmen are over.
- Says tricky dick.

181
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,534
Says me.

182
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,247
Nobody knows who you are.

183
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,375
You can give it up,
try and have a normal life.

184
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,837
Rorschach: That what you have now?
A normal life?

185
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,383
When you walk down the street
in a city dying of rabies,

186
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,343
past the human cockroaches

187
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,596
talking about their heroin
and child pornography,

188
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,098
do you really feel normal?

189
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,726
Least I'm not the one
still hiding behind a mask.

190
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,230
Rorschach: No.

191
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,650
You're hiding in plain sight.

192
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,279
Be seeing you, Dan.

193
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,591
There's a maintenance hatch
will let you out two blocks north.

194
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,576
Yeah, I remember.

195
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,704
Came here often,
when we were partners.

196
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,665
Dan: Those were great times, huh,
rorschach?

197
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,585
- What happened?
- You quit.

198
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,818
Rorschach: Rorschach's journal.

199
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,738
First visit of evening fruitless.

200
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,823
Feel slightly depressed.

201
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,367
Soon there will be war.

202
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:33,495
Millions will perish
in sickness and misery.

203
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:36,749
Why does one death matter
against so many?

204
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:41,462
Because there is good and evil,
and evil must be punished.

205
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,548
Even in the face of armageddon,

206
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,551
I will not compromise in this.

207
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:51,388
But there are so many
deserving of retribution

208
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,350
and so little time.

209
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,010
Man: Captain.

210
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,388
- Captain.
- Ridley.

211
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,349
Ridley, have you seen
any other survivors?

212
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:36,850
No, sir.

213
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:40,813
Captain, my foot is caught
in some of the wreckage.

214
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,441
- It's pulling me under.
- Hold on.

215
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,445
Ridley.

216
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,126
Ridley. Ridley.

217
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,216
More blood, more blood, more blood.

218
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,844
Mariner: Delirious from nearly drowning,
I saw it.

219
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:14,722
The black freighter.

220
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:19,935
The hell-bound ship's black sails
against the yellow indies sky.

221
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:26,942
I knew again the stench of powder
and men's brains and war.

222
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:30,154
More blood, more blood, more blood.

223
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,291
More blood, more blood, more blood.

224
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,591
Mariner:
The waves about me were Scarlet,

225
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,677
foaming, horribly warm
in the freighter's wake.

226
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:57,056
In despair, I offered
my weathered soul to almighty god,

227
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,767
his mercy and his judgment.

228
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,021
Man: Heh. What do you think, kid?

229
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:07,024
We ought to nuke Russia
and let god sort it out.

230
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,319
Or at the very least,
send dr Manhattan over for a visit.

231
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,029
You know what I'm saying?

232
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,923
I mean, I ain't trying
to be an asshole or anything,

233
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:14,948
but they're the ones

234
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,701
who are agitating us.
Now this is just my opinion.

235
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:20,496
But I'm a news vendor, you know,
so I am informed.

236
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:25,501
Yeah, I know. The new frontiersman.
Well, it's not here yet.

237
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,270
I'd appreciate if you didn't
stand around waiting

238
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,089
because I don't know when
it's going to be here.

239
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,257
I thought you said you was informed.

240
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,595
- Are you gonna buy that?
- No.

241
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:42,976
Oh, Jesus.
Just try again tomorrow, okay?

242
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,613
Doug: Mr veidt,

243
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,949
to date,
you're one of only two watchmen

244
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,576
ever to reveal their true identity
to the world,

245
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,537
the first being Hollis Mason.

246
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,665
And you've certainly profited greatly
by it,

247
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,084
turning your superhero alter ego,

248
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:10,212
ozymandias,
into a billion-dollar industry:

249
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,631
Toys, lunchboxes, genetic engineering.

250
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,509
I understand there's even a movie
in the works.

251
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,719
I'm not hearing a question, mr roth.

252
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,013
Doug: I'm sorry. Do you think...

253
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:22,683
The other watchmen resent me
for prostituting their struggle?

254
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,686
It's a fair question.
Yes, it's crossed my mind

255
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,147
some of my old colleagues
might see it that way,

256
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:32,025
just as you're clearly aware
that biased journalism

257
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:34,528
sells more magazines.

258
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,656
The merchandising arm
of veidt industries

259
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,658
is funding our work
with dr Manhattan.

260
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,995
We recently expanded
our research facility in Antarctica

261
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,665
in the hope of developing cheap,
renewable sources of energy

262
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,751
that we might eliminate
the world's reliance on fossil fuels.

263
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,462
Now, it doesn't take
a political scientist

264
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:55,799
to see that our cold war
with the Russians isn't ideological,

265
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:58,552
it's based upon fear.
Fear of not having enough.

266
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:03,015
But if we make resources infinite...

267
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:04,975
Ah...

268
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,686
We make war obsolete.

269
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,815
I would hope the other watchmen
understand that

270
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,569
Wherever they may be.

271
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:18,989
Thanks for your time.

272
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,372
- You look good, Adrian.
- Dan.

273
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,917
It's been too long.

274
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,672
So rorschach thinks
someone's hunting the watchmen, huh?

275
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,592
You think it's possible?

276
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,637
I think, statistically, one murder
doesn't equal a trend.

277
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,723
Rorschach's a sociopath, Dan.

278
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:48,310
And so was the comedian.
He was practically a Nazi.

279
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,730
You know that better than anyone.

280
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,649
I'm not here because I miss him.

281
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,589
It's obviously occurred to rorschach

282
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,932
that we're the only ones
who know each other's identities.

283
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,198
Actually, the whole world knows yours.

284
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,992
That's why I'm warning you first.

285
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,665
Thank you, Dan.

286
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,504
But I fear there's something
much more real to worry about

287
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,297
than rorschach's mask killer.

288
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,137
If the Russians do launch their nukes,
can Jon really stop them?

289
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,474
The Soviets have 51,000
warheads stockpiled.

290
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:31,520
Even if Jon stops 99% of them,

291
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,897
the 1% that get through

292
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,857
could still kill
every living thing on earth.

293
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,529
Even dr Manhattan
can't be everywhere at once.

294
00:29:55,294 --> 00:30:00,132
Rorschach: Rorschach's journal,
October 13th, 1985,

295
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,467
8:30 pm.

296
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,930
Meeting with dreiberg
left bad taste in mouth,

297
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,101
a flabby failure who sits
whimpering in his basement.

298
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,315
Why are so few of us left active,

299
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:20,402
healthy and without
personality disorders?

300
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,906
The first nite owl
runs an auto repair shop.

301
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,535
The first silk spectre
is a bloated, aging whore

302
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,621
dying in a California rest resort.

303
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,416
Dollar bill got his cape stuck
in a revolving door

304
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,834
where he got gunned down.

305
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,171
Silhouette, murdered,

306
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,798
a victim of her own
indecent lifestyle.

307
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,052
Mothman's in an asylum in Maine.

308
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:54,102
Even Adrian veidt,
possible homosexual.

309
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,687
Must investigate further.

310
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,524
Only two names remain on my list.

311
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,610
Both share private quarters

312
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:05,280
at rockefeller
military research center.

313
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:08,033
I shall go to them.

314
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:12,496
I shall go tell the indestructible man
that someone plans to murder him.

315
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,124
Dr Manhattan: Good evening, rorschach.

316
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,836
Rorschach: Dr Manhattan,
you know why I'm here.

317
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,921
Dr Manhattan: Yes...

318
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,633
But you're going
to leave disappointed.

319
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,512
Rorschach. You shouldn't be here.
You're a wanted man.

320
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,931
Rorschach: Nice to see you too,
silk spectre.

321
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,350
I have a real name I've been using
a couple of years now

322
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,686
- try it.
- Whatever you say, Laurie.

323
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,105
What are you doing here?

324
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:40,524
Dr Manhattan: The comedian is dead.

325
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,068
Rorschach wants me
to look into my future,

326
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,612
see if the killer is ever
publicly identified.

327
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,698
Already warned dreiberg.
Came to warn you too.

328
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:52,994
Even if I wanted to help,

329
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:58,125
my future is blocked
by some kind of temporal interference.

330
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,628
- I cannot see it clearly.
- Interference?

331
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:06,258
- Caused by what?
- In all likelihood, nuclear holocaust.

332
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:10,429
If the United States and Soviet union
engage in all-out war,

333
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,473
the resulting blast wave
would produce

334
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,559
a sudden burst of tachyons,

335
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:19,396
particles which travel backward
through what you perceive as time,

336
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,650
therefore obscuring my vision
of the present.

337
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,862
I must return to my work.

338
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,113
Rorschach: Wait a minute.

339
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,907
What if that's why
someone wants us out of the way?

340
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:33,201
So we can't do anything to stop it?

341
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,078
Good bye, rorschach.

342
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,390
Rorschach: Took a lot of effort
to get in here to see you.

343
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:38,915
I'm not leaving...

344
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,918
Till I've had my say.

345
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,180
Seems like there's a lot of things
you don't tell me these days, Jon.

346
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,849
I didn't wanna worry you prematurely.

347
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:00,770
If Adrian and I can solve
the energy crisis, war may be averted.

348
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,934
Laurie: But you always say
that time is simultaneous.

349
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,401
If that's true,
then how can you change the future?

350
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:10,614
If only you could
perceive time as I do.

351
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:12,949
Please let me show you.

352
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,000
Magic. Dreams.
That is what I had before.

353
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,127
I was a hero, goddamn it!

354
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:27,297
It's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

355
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,466
I'm putting food on the table
for you and your child.

356
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,403
Why don't you call your friend Eddie?
Maybe he can give you a better life.

357
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:36,765
- It was a mistake. One time.
- Man tries to rape you...

358
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,600
Stop!

359
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,061
Your mind goes to dark places

360
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,313
and you wonder
why I keep the worst from you.

361
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,861
- Say hello to Dan for me.
- What?

362
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,366
You wanna ask me
to go to dinner with you

363
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,495
like we used to.

364
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:01,957
But you won't.

365
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,417
You know I can't.

366
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,922
So you'll call Dan,

367
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,591
which is only natural.

368
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:14,276
You deserve the comfort
of an old friend.

369
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,047
Laurie: Dan dreiberg's table.

370
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,322
Dan: Did you know that he and hj were...
I had no idea.

371
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,033
Laurie: You remember that crazy guy?

372
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,369
What'd he call himself?
Captain carnage.

373
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:22,933
Used to pretend he was a supervillain

374
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,636
just so he could get beat up
all the time.

375
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,167
Yeah, he tried that on me once.
I just walked away.

376
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,545
He starts following me down the street
in broad daylight

377
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,797
yelling, "punish me! Punish me!"

378
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,009
I'm just saying, "no, get lost."

379
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,304
God, whatever happened to him?

380
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,015
Oh, erm... he pulled that on rorschach,

381
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,309
and rorschach
dropped him down an elevator shaft.

382
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,485
Oh, my god. That's not even funny.

383
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,987
- It's a little funny.
- A little bit.

384
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,825
Woman: I'm glad I ordered
the four-legged chicken.

385
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,577
It's really good to see you again.

386
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:05,437
It's great seeing you, too, Laurie.

387
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,792
Why'd we do it, Dan?
Dress up like that?

388
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:13,380
- No one else would.
- Yeah, but do you remember my costume?

389
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:16,341
All that tight latex?
I mean, it was awful.

390
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,344
Er... yeah, yeah, awful.

391
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,430
But didn't wanna disappoint mother.

392
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,892
Wanted her little girl to be
just like her and fight bad guys.

393
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,743
I think the keene act was the
best thing that ever happened to us.

394
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,608
Well, we'll live longer anyway.

395
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,446
What?

396
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,576
Jon thinks, unless he can do something
about it

397
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,163
that there's gonna be nuclear war.

398
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,165
Soon.

399
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,793
But I don't know what to think.

400
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:56,881
I mean, it's all quantum mechanics
and parallel realities with him.

401
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:59,592
I never even know
what universe he's actually seeing.

402
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:04,139
He just keeps getting further away
from me.

403
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,599
Everyone.

404
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,103
I can't even tell if he
actually cares about me any more

405
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,604
or if he's just pretending.

406
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,734
If he's pretending, it means he cares.

407
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,824
Hold on, I'll get the door.

408
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:25,910
Thanks, Dan.

409
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,204
- Got it?
- Yeah.

410
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,795
Do you always get
a government escort to dinner?

411
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,108
They're making sure
I don't do anything

412
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,384
to upset the country's
most powerful weapon.

413
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,554
I'm sorry.

414
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:47,766
I invite you out to dinner to catch up
and have a few laughs,

415
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,624
but there don't seem to be that
many laughs around these days.

416
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,315
What do you expect?
The comedian's dead.

417
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:42,505
Laurie? Is that you?

418
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,137
Thought you'd be used
to travelling that way by now.

419
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:53,349
Well, I'm not.
I hate it when Jon teleports me.

420
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,102
Well, it beats flying coach.

421
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,271
Margarita?

422
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,608
Mother, it's 2:00 in the afternoon.

423
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,570
Mmm.

424
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,615
Remember that guy
that writes me letters?

425
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:12,285
He sent me an item of memorabilia.
It's a Tijuana Bible.

426
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:16,581
This little eight-page porno comic
they did in the '305 and '405.

427
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,499
- He sent you this?
- Sure.

428
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,919
They're very valuable, like antiques.

429
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,463
Mother, this is gross.

430
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,256
I think it's kind of flattering.

431
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,343
Why do you always call me mother
when you're mad?

432
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,805
I know why you're here.
I can still read, you know.

433
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,100
I saw it in the paper.

434
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,729
Eddie Blake's funeral is today.

435
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,692
Finally got his punchline, I guess.

436
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:48,446
- Poor Eddie.
- Poor Eddie? After what he did to you?

437
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,698
Oh, Laurie, you're still young.

438
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:52,992
You don't know.

439
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,328
Things change.

440
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,665
What happened happened 40 years ago.

441
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,376
I'm 67 years old.

442
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:06,130
Every day, the future
looks a little bit darker.

443
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:08,925
But the past...

444
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,303
Even the grimy parts of it...

445
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,556
Keep on getting brighter.

446
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,399
I've got spots in my eyes.

447
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,946
Stop it, Eddie.

448
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,117
- Thank you, weegee.
- Thank you, mr owl.

449
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:39,747
Tomorrow, 3:00, my studio.

450
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:42,583
- Little place on 21st.
- Sounds good.

451
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:46,713
Silk spectre: Wow, a real photo session.
Wonder how my hair will look.

452
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,427
Oh, go ahead. I'll be there in five.

453
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:10,862
Eddie.

454
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,949
What the hell are you doing here?
You knew I was changing.

455
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,994
Sure I did.

456
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,913
Come on, baby.

457
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,332
I know what you need.

458
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,060
I mean, you gotta have
some kind of reason

459
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,919
for dressing in an outfit like this.

460
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,297
I said no, Eddie.

461
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:35,303
- No spelled y-e-s.
- No spelled n-o.

462
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:38,222
- All right?
- Come on, sweetheart.

463
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,604
Eddie...

464
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,355
You little bastard.

465
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,239
This what you like?

466
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,116
- This what makes you hot?
- What?

467
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,671
Things are tough all over, cupcake.

468
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,550
It rains on the just
and the unjust alike.

469
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:59,637
The comedian was a little bit of both.

470
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,684
And he always thought
he'd get the last laugh.

471
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:08,771
Man: Thou knowest, lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

472
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,525
Shut not thy merciful ears
to our prayers,

473
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:17,363
but spare us, lord most holy,
o god most mighty,

474
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:20,449
o holy and merciful saviour,

475
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,036
thou most worthyjudge eternal.

476
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,623
Suffer us not at our last hour
for any...

477
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:57,171
Edward: Fireworks.
You gotta be kidding me.

478
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,967
You know, you'd think this goddamn
country had had enough fireworks.

479
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,679
You know,
if we'd lost here in Vietnam,

480
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,640
I think it might
have driven us crazy.

481
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:09,934
You know, as a country.

482
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:14,814
But we didn't, thanks to you.

483
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,026
You sound bitter.

484
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:20,987
Me? Bitter?

485
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,447
Fuck, no. I think it's hilarious.

486
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,665
Oh, Jesus Christ.

487
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,793
- Mr Eddie?
- Just what I fucking needed.

488
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:40,381
The war is over now.
We must talk about this baby.

489
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:44,635
There's nothing to talk about.
See, I'm leaving.

490
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:46,470
I'm gonna forget about you

491
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,764
and your horrible, sweaty,
little piece-of—shit country.

492
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:51,392
Get the fuck out of here.

493
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:55,146
- No.
- Get the fuck out of here.

494
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,522
You will remember.

495
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,985
You will remember me and my country...

496
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:03,487
Foreverl -

497
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:07,950
My face!

498
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:11,370
Blake. Don't.

499
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,497
Blake!

500
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:21,881
She was pregnant

501
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:25,217
and you gunned her down.

502
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,470
That's right.

503
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,555
And you know what? You watched me.

504
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:32,159
You could have turned the gun
into steam, the bullets to Mercury,

505
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:35,394
the bottle into goddamn snowflakes,
but you didn't, did you?

506
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,858
You really don't give a damn
about human beings.

507
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,487
You're drifting out of touch, doc.

508
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,282
God help us all.

509
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:52,119
Medic!

510
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,176
Man: He cometh up and is cut down,
like a flower.

511
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:11,389
In the midst of life, we are in death.

512
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:16,727
Of whom may we seek succour,
but of thee, o lord?

513
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,859
Welcome. We'll be starting shortly.

514
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,070
We're waiting for one more.

515
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:39,792
I told you, you wouldn't be
the only one dressed up.

516
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,671
Welcome, doctor.

517
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:45,589
Now we can start.

518
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:47,466
Thank you for coming today.

519
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,945
I ask you acquaint yourselves
with this map of high-crime areas.

520
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:52,388
This is all bullshit.

521
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:55,182
You know, for a guy who
calls himself the comedian,

522
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,518
I can never tell when you're joking.

523
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:00,938
Watchmen. That's the real joke.

524
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,039
It didn't work 15 years ago,
it sure as hell ain't gonna work now,

525
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,360
just 'cause you want to keep playing
cowboys and Indians.

526
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,904
Maybe we should agree
on no drinking at meetings.

527
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:12,843
Look, rorschach and I have made
real headway on the gang problem

528
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:13,868
by working together.

529
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,930
Rorschach: With a group this size,
seems like a publicity stunt.

530
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:18,956
I'm not in it for the ink.

531
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,773
Ozymandias: We can do so much more.

532
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,793
We can save this world

533
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:27,423
- With the right leadership.
- Yeah.

534
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,303
And that'd be you, right, ozzy?

535
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,014
I mean, hell,
you're the smartest man on the planet.

536
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,933
It doesn't take a genius
to see the world has problems.

537
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,186
Yeah, but it takes a room
full of morons

538
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:42,149
to think they're small enough
for you to handle.

539
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:43,647
You people,

540
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:47,276
you hear moloch's back in town,
get your panties all in a bunch.

541
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:50,154
- You think catching him matters?
- Justice matters.

542
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:52,823
Jusfice.

543
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,868
Justice is coming to all of us,

544
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,953
no matter what the fuck we do.

545
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,682
You know, mankind's
been trying to kill each other off

546
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,708
since the beginning of time.

547
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:06,545
Now we'll finally have the power
to finish the job.

548
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,941
Ain't nothing gonna matter once
those nukes start flying.

549
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,175
We'll all be dust.

550
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:16,388
Then ozymandias here

551
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,308
will be the smartest man
on the cinder.

552
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:32,964
Man: Almighty god
to take onto himself

553
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:36,033
the soul of our
dear departed brother.

554
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:40,287
Let us therefore commit his body
to the ground.

555
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:46,877
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust...

556
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,555
Man: Yeah! Yeah!

557
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,977
Man 2: Hit it! Hit it!

558
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,145
- Yeah!
- Man 3: We don't need you.

559
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,734
Man 4: We've got to get rid
of these watchmen!

560
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:14,363
Police! Police to protect the people!

561
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:24,081
Nite owl ii: Attention, citizens.
We are trying to maintain order.

562
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:28,377
You must clear the streets
until the police strike is over.

563
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:31,797
If you could...
Please, there's no need for violence.

564
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,967
We are trying to retain order
on the streets

565
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,802
until the police strike is over.

566
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:39,179
Crawl back in your holes
before you get hurt.

567
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,599
- I got rubber bullets.
- I want my rights!

568
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:44,310
- You are not the law!
- Man: We want regular cops!

569
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,894
No more vigilantes!

570
00:51:45,978 --> 00:51:48,939
My son's a police officer,
you fucking faggots!

571
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,360
Goddamn it. All right.
That's how you wanna do it?

572
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,346
Nite owl ii:
There's no need for violence.

573
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,835
Fuck you. Fuck you!

574
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:18,510
Oh, this is getting heavy.

575
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,746
Goddamn, I love working
on American soil, Dan.

576
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,999
Ain't had this much fun
since woodward and Bernstein.

577
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,243
How long can we keep this up?

578
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:54,588
Congress is pushing through some
new bill that's gonna outlaw masks.

579
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,215
Our days are numbered.

580
00:52:56,298 --> 00:53:00,469
Until then, it's like you always say,
"we're society's only protection."

581
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:04,306
- From what?
- Are you kidding me? From themselves.

582
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,768
- Son of a bitch.
- No, comedian, wait!

583
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,021
Get your stinking hands off me.

584
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,192
What the hell happened to us?

585
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:22,157
What happened to the American dream?

586
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:26,161
What happened to the American dream?

587
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:28,455
It came true!

588
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:29,957
You're looking at it.

589
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,373
Edgar William jacobi.

590
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,750
Also known as Edgar William Vaughn.

591
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:38,377
Also known as moloch.

592
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,550
What are you talking about?

593
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,135
I'm a retired businessman...

594
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:52,182
Lie again, moloch,
I break another finger.

595
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:53,851
I did my time.

596
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,353
I'm not moloch any more.

597
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:01,567
- What do you want from me?
- Heard you attended Blake's funeral.

598
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:05,153
I just felt I should...

599
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:10,117
Pay my respects to the comedian.

600
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:16,915
- How'd you know he was the comedian?
- He broke in here. A week ago.

601
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,293
He had his mask off.

602
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:23,589
- He was drunk.
- Enemies. For decades.

603
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,008
- Why should he visit you?
- I don't know.

604
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,970
I woke up in my bedroom
and there he was.

605
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:31,805
He was upset.

606
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,266
He was crying.

607
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,852
Crying? The comedian?

608
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,646
Edgar: He was babbling,
not making any sense.

609
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,232
I was pissing in my pants.

610
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,069
I thought he was gonna kill me.

611
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:47,779
Rorschach: What did he say?

612
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,159
It's a joke.

613
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,036
It's all a fucking joke.

614
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,665
You know, I thought I knew how it was.

615
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,543
I thought I knew how the world was.

616
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,672
I've done some bad things.

617
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,968
I did bad things to women.
I shot kids.

618
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:12,346
In 'nam, you know.

619
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,806
But that was fucking war.

620
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:16,850
This...

621
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:19,937
I never done anything like this.

622
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:25,484
God, here I am

623
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:27,402
spilling my guts...

624
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,280
To one of my archenemies.

625
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:33,992
But the truth is...

626
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,597
Truth is, you're the closest thing
to a friend I got.

627
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:38,956
What the fuck does that say?

628
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:45,295
Shit.

629
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:49,383
And your name...

630
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,134
Your name was on the list

631
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:56,598
along with janey, you know,
whatever the fuck her name is.

632
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,308
Manhattan's old girl.

633
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:04,940
Mother, forgive me.

634
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,110
Edgar: And then he left.

635
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:13,615
I swear! Don't know
what the hell he was talking about.

636
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:21,999
Funny story.

637
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,376
Sounds unbelievable.

638
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,546
Probably true.

639
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,549
So that's it?

640
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:34,261
- I'm clean?
- You?

641
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,098
Clean?

642
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:43,895
Amygdalin.

643
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,732
This phony medication
made from apricot pits.

644
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,067
- It's illegal.
- Come on.

645
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,029
Look, man.

646
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:54,156
Please don't confiscate that.

647
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,992
I'm trying anything.

648
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,829
I have cancer.

649
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,331
What kind of cancer?

650
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,461
You know the kind
you eventually get better from?

651
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:12,049
That ain't the kind I got.

652
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:18,680
Rorschach: Rorschach's journal.
October 16th.

653
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:22,809
Want some of this?
Fifty bucks, I'll suck your...

654
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,395
- Thought about moloch's story.
- Come on.

655
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:27,647
Could all be lies.

656
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:32,027
A revenge scheme
planned during his years behind bars.

657
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,987
Fuck you.

658
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:37,282
I make more in a week than
you make in a year, you fucking homo.

659
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,034
But if it's true,

660
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:41,536
what could have possibly
scared the comedian

661
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,705
enough to cry in front of moloch?

662
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,124
What was it he saw?

663
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,252
And that list he mentioned.

664
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:57,010
Edward Blake. The comedian.

665
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,554
Born 1918.

666
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:01,765
Buried in the rain.

667
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:03,767
Murdered.

668
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:07,771
Is that what happens to us?
No time for friends?

669
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:11,024
Only our enemies leave roses.

670
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:15,070
Violent lives ending violently.

671
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,493
Blake understood.
Humans are savage in nature.

672
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:25,372
No matter how much you try
to dress it up

673
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,541
to disguise it,

674
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,752
Blake saw society's true face.

675
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:34,506
Chose to be a parody of it. A joke.

676
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:37,342
I heard joke once.

677
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:42,514
Man goes to doctor,
says he's depressed.

678
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,392
Life seems harsh and cruel.

679
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:50,564
Says he feels all alone
in threatening world.

680
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,650
Doctor says treatment is simple.

681
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:58,488
"The great clown pagliacci is in town.
Go see him.

682
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:00,866
"That should pick you up."

683
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:03,994
Man bursts into tears.

684
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:08,290
"But doctor, " he says.
"I am pagliacci."

685
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:12,377
Good joke.

686
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,337
Everybody laugh.

687
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:15,881
Roll on snare drum.

688
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,466
Curtains.

689
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,721
- Hollis: Hey, Bernie.
- Yeah?

690
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,448
Hollis: Can I get a time magazine
from you there?

691
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:26,850
- Bernie: Sure.
- How much you want for it now?

692
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,727
For you, two bucks.

693
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:31,146
Two bucks. Going up, huh?

694
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,773
There you go. Thanks.

695
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:35,442
Hey, I like your book.

696
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:38,570
Hey, thanks, Bernie. I appreciate it.

697
01:02:29,496 --> 01:02:33,792
Mariner: When I awoke, lfound myself
upon a dismal beachhead

698
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,294
with my men.

699
01:02:37,045 --> 01:02:39,422
Pieces of my men.

700
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:49,015
It was all I could do for her

701
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:52,686
though she had borne me
through seas of blood.

702
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:57,148
Her damp embrace had prevented me
from drifting beyond reach.

703
01:02:57,232 --> 01:03:01,319
Yet this small comfort
was all I could offer.

704
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,082
One of my crew lay ahead.

705
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:17,252
Birds were eating
his thoughts and memories.

706
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:18,586
Away. Yah!

707
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,630
Yah! Get away.

708
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:26,094
In hell,
at least the gulls are contented.

709
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:31,808
For my part, I begged that
they should take my eyes.

710
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:34,894
Thus sparing me future horrors.

711
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,900
What time do you have to be
at your interview?

712
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:42,652
Dr Manhattan: Don't worry.

713
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:45,113
We've got plenty of time.

714
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:55,123
Your finger's like licking a battery.

715
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:18,229
God, Jon, stop. What are you doing?

716
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:19,939
Please don't be upset.

717
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:22,567
I always thought you liked this.

718
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:24,944
Laurie: No.

719
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,740
I don't... no.

720
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:32,285
I don't want that.

721
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,789
I don't know
what stimulates you any more.

722
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:41,753
Look, I know you were just trying...

723
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,758
Are you working in here
while we're in bed together?

724
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:49,552
My work with Adrian
is at a critical stage right now.

725
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:53,473
- I didn't think it was necessary to...
- To what?

726
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:57,227
To what? To tell me which one of you
is giving me a pity fuck?

727
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:09,239
My attention was completely focused
on you.

728
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:12,075
If you think there's a problem
with my attitude,

729
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:13,368
I am prepared to discuss it.

730
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:19,666
You know how everything in this world
fits together except people.

731
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,293
What am I to you?

732
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:24,337
Another puzzle to be solved?

733
01:05:24,796 --> 01:05:26,297
Have your men stand back.

734
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:28,299
I'm teleporting the reactor
to karnak now.

735
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:31,761
You're my only remaining link
to the world.

736
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:42,313
I don't want
that responsibility any more.

737
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,405
He's all yours.

738
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,955
Man: Don't worry, Jon.
She'll be back.

739
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:02,292
No, she won't.

740
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:21,769
Man: He's been called
many things: Hero, weapon,

741
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,606
linchpin of our national security,

742
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:29,527
deterrent to nuclear war,
or a man to end worlds.

743
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:32,238
Later tonight, dr Manhattan

744
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:37,368
will answer my questions and yours
in an exclusive interview

745
01:06:37,452 --> 01:06:41,372
brought to you commercial-free
by veidt enterprises.

746
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,556
Who is it?

747
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,016
Laurie: It's Laurie.

748
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:13,947
Sorry. I just had
this new lock installed.

749
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:16,199
I didn't know where else to go.

750
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:19,661
Oh, it's okay. Come in.

751
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:29,629
What's wrong?

752
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:31,798
I left Jon.

753
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:34,217
Oh, god.

754
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:36,886
I'm so sorry.

755
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:39,556
I don't know why I'm here. I just...

756
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:43,393
I don't know anybody else.

757
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:48,189
I don't know anybody
except for goddamn superheroes.

758
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,775
That's okay.

759
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:52,986
You probably just had an argument
or something.

760
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,529
No, Dan.

761
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,574
You don't know what it's been like
living with him.

762
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:00,451
The way he looks at things now,
it's like he doesn't

763
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:03,538
remember what they are.

764
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:06,416
It's like this world,
this real world,

765
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:09,586
to him,
it's like walking through mist.

766
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:13,381
And people are just shadows.

767
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,468
Shadows in a fog.

768
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,764
God, how did everything
get so tangled up?

769
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:25,768
I'm sorry, Dan.

770
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,646
This is twice now
I've ruined your evening.

771
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:33,234
Come on. I'm glad you came over.

772
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:36,237
I was just gonna see Hollis
for our weekly beer session.

773
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,115
You're more than welcome to join.

774
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:42,994
In fact, I insist.

775
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:19,072
Terrific. Dr Manhattan arrives
and no one thinks to tell me.

776
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,966
- Woman: He just...
- We don't have time for makeup.

777
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,617
That blue is too light for television.

778
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:27,747
Is that dark enough?

779
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:32,085
Producer: Erm...
Yeah, that's dark enough.

780
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:34,605
Bernie:
The weight of the world's on him,

781
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:36,798
but does he quit? No, he can take it.

782
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,384
News vendors always cope.
They're the...

783
01:09:39,467 --> 01:09:41,886
Oh, god, here comes
that homeless guy again.

784
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:46,307
I told you, this month's issue
still hasn't arrived yet.

785
01:09:46,391 --> 01:09:48,726
Why do you care about
that right-wing rag so much?

786
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:51,062
Those bastards don't give a damn
about you, but they...

787
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:52,745
Hold up. Here they come.

788
01:09:57,318 --> 01:10:00,113
- Seymour.
- Bernie, how's tricks?

789
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,447
Bernie: Fine, fine.

790
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:11,874
Maybe we should get a cab.
These are bad neighbourhoods.

791
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:14,544
Yeah, well, I'm in a bad mood.

792
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:30,059
Man 1: Girl.
Man 2: What we got here?

793
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:33,563
Here's a list of Pentagon-approved
no-go areas.

794
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:36,399
Afghanistan will obviously come up,
but just play it cool

795
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:39,110
and try not to get
into any tight corners.

796
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:42,864
A renowned nuclear physicist,
who, through a terrible accident

797
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:45,616
was gifted
with extraordinary powers,

798
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:48,828
capable of bending matter to his will.

799
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:53,291
Today, the world knows him
as dr Manhattan.

800
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:54,876
Welcome.

801
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:00,882
Thank you.

802
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,842
Man 3: That's right.

803
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:12,477
Ms black,
you have the first question.

804
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,061
Dr Manhattan, as you know,

805
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:17,148
the doomsday clock
is a symbolic clock face

806
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:20,902
analogising humankind's proximity
to extinction,

807
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:24,113
midnight representing the threat
of nuclear war.

808
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:27,116
As of now, it stands at four minutes
to midnight.

809
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:30,328
Would you agree
that we're that close to annihilation?

810
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:32,663
My father was a watchmaker.

811
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:37,752
He abandoned it when Einstein
discovered that time is relative.

812
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,422
I would only agree
that a symbolic clock

813
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:43,633
is as nourishing to the intellect

814
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:46,886
as a photograph of oxygen
to a drowning man.

815
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,057
So you're saying there is no danger.

816
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:53,202
Dr Manhattan:
Even in a world without nuclear weapons,

817
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:55,061
there would still be danger.

818
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:03,069
Man: And would you say,
as so many claim,

819
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,029
that you are, in fact, a god,

820
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:08,157
given you see the past
and the future simultaneously?

821
01:12:08,241 --> 01:12:10,493
I can only see my own past,

822
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:14,956
my own future. I am not omniscient.

823
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:17,041
Koppel: Doug roth, your question?

824
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:19,335
Speaking of your past,
dr Manhattan,

825
01:12:19,961 --> 01:12:22,922
do you remember a man
named Wally Weaver?

826
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:27,760
Yes. We were both physicists together
at the gila flats research base.

827
01:12:28,553 --> 01:12:30,012
He died of cancer.

828
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:33,307
- He was a good man.
- How about Edgar jacobi,

829
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:35,560
also known as
the supervillain moloch?

830
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:40,648
You encountered him several times
in the '60s: Battles, conflicts.

831
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:43,693
Did you know
that he has cancer as well?

832
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:46,112
I wasn't told.

833
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:48,322
Doug: And what about
general Anthony Randolph?

834
01:12:48,406 --> 01:12:51,200
He was your handler when you first
started working for the government.

835
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:53,536
Cancer.

836
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:56,163
You're suggesting I was the cause.

837
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:57,933
Doug: From where I'm standing,

838
01:12:57,957 --> 01:12:59,834
it's starting
to look pretty conclusive.

839
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:02,295
Dr Manhattan: Even if that's the case,
it's irrelevant.

840
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,964
A live human body
and a deceased human body

841
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,799
have the same number of particles.

842
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,554
Structurally, there's no difference.

843
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:15,224
All right. Let's settle down, please.

844
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:22,398
What about janey slater?

845
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:24,942
You think it makes
a difference to her?

846
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:28,321
Janey?

847
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:29,614
Your ex-girlfriend?

848
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:33,618
She was a physicist too.
You saw each other for 11 years.

849
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:35,328
Doug, one question at a time.

850
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:38,748
She has cancer as well.
Doctors have given her six months.

851
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:40,833
Isn't that right, miss slater?

852
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:58,142
You were the world to me, Jon.

853
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:00,394
You were my whole life.

854
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:04,565
Do you remember how many times
you said you loved me?

855
01:14:04,941 --> 01:14:06,859
Janey, I wasn't told.

856
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:08,986
I stuck by you after the accident.

857
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,364
I gave you everything.

858
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:18,955
This is how you repay me?

859
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:24,293
- Janey, I wasn't told. I didn't know.
- Damn you, Jon. Goddamn you.

860
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:26,253
Janey, wait.

861
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:30,567
- That's it. This interview is over.
- Man: Get up there. Get up there.

862
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:33,386
Get those cameras off.
Everybody back off.

863
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,929
Everybody back off.

864
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:37,014
I need some backup here.
Leave him alone.

865
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:42,353
Please, if everyone
would just go away

866
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:45,690
and leave me alone.

867
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,858
Do you care to comment?

868
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:50,778
I said, leave me alone!

869
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:18,139
Jesus.

870
01:15:22,018 --> 01:15:23,394
Getting mugged.

871
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:27,481
Let's go.

872
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:35,156
I'm shaking.

873
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:45,458
You know what? I'm wiped.
I'm just gonna call it a night.

874
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:48,127
Oh, are you sure you don't wanna
come by Hollis' with me

875
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,087
and shake off the adrenaline?

876
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:54,133
I think I've had enough hero stuff
for one night.

877
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:57,595
It helped having you listen.

878
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,056
Any time.

879
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:02,808
Take care, Dan.

880
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:05,686
It's a rough world out there.

881
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:09,440
Dan: Be seeing you.

882
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,323
Marin er: I thought of my family,

883
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,742
my wife, my daughters.

884
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:22,369
Vulnerable, unsuspecting.

885
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:26,040
Awaiting my return,
only to be met by damnation

886
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:27,708
bearing down upon them.

887
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,218
Hey! Over here!

888
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:40,012
Here!

889
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:47,061
Ridley.

890
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:04,829
A sail.

891
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:07,998
Ridley had brought me a sail.

892
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:10,501
Perhaps this could be my route
back to davidstown.

893
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:15,297
Everything I loved,
everything I lived for,

894
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:17,007
depended on my reaching home

895
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:19,385
in advance
of that terrible freighter.

896
01:17:29,937 --> 01:17:32,398
The morning sun found me
no less troubled.

897
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:35,276
Further down the shore,

898
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:38,112
some of my crew
had become inflated with gas.

899
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:46,328
I shuddered at my own idea,

900
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:49,790
attempting to banish
this repulsive notion.

901
01:17:57,423 --> 01:18:00,718
Even in death,
they sought to fulfil their duty

902
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:04,722
making our vessel more buoyant.

903
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:07,933
And I would do my duty to them
in returning them home.

904
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:12,521
Rudely jarring my men
from eternal rest,

905
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:14,899
and laying them
in the bed I prepared.

906
01:18:15,065 --> 01:18:19,361
I hoped my wife and daughters
might be tucked in by gentler hands

907
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:21,488
when their turn came.

908
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:40,925
We shall get home together, my friend.

909
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,013
I waited for the tide.

910
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:49,475
Then, embarking, headed east.

911
01:18:50,893 --> 01:18:53,604
East, across the night seas.

912
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:57,483
East, borne on the bodies
of murdered men.

913
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:01,278
Hope can be a horrible thing.

914
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:10,806
With the dawn came the gulls
looking for breakfast.

915
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:11,974
Ridley.

916
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:16,270
Get out.

917
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:25,112
I was reminded that I,
myself, had not eaten.

918
01:20:27,698 --> 01:20:30,909
I know it is unappetising,
but it is all we have.

919
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,084
Man: He's gone.

920
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:41,211
- He's gone!
- Bernie: Who's gone?

921
01:20:41,295 --> 01:20:43,422
- Dr Manhattan.
- Bernie: What? What'd you say?

922
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,716
Dr Manhattan's gone. He's left us.

923
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:48,761
What? Gone where?

924
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:57,895
- You're late.
- Ah, I know. I know.

925
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:00,165
You won't believe what happened.

926
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:03,025
Dr Manhattan just lost it on live TV.

927
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:04,485
Wait, what?

928
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:12,326
I was just with Laurie.
She doesn't know.

929
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:16,789
She's gonna know soon enough.
The whole world will know.

930
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,875
I said, leave me alone!

931
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:32,137
Dr Manhattan:
I am looking at the stars.

932
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:34,431
They're so far away.

933
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:36,517
And their light takes so long
to reach us.

934
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:43,232
All we ever see of stars
are their old photographs.

935
01:21:47,945 --> 01:21:50,989
It is July, 1959, and I am in love.

936
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:54,201
Man: That's great.

937
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:56,203
- You can pick it up tomorrow.
- Okay.

938
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:57,996
- Seventy-five cents.
- Okay, thank you.

939
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,248
Thank you.

940
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:02,126
Gosh, Jon,
I wish he gave us a little notice.

941
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:03,419
I'm sure I made a face.

942
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:07,714
Oh, no, no.
I'm sure that you'll look beautiful.

943
01:22:12,553 --> 01:22:14,346
Her name is janey slater.

944
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,558
She is a physicist, like me.

945
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:21,311
I am 30 years old.

946
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:29,778
We were introduced by a good friend
of mine from college, Wally Weaver.

947
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:36,869
It is February 12th, 1981.

948
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:40,873
Wally dies of cancer,
of which they now say I am the cause.

949
01:22:57,681 --> 01:23:00,350
That night, janey and I make love
for the first time.

950
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:11,320
A month from now,
the accident awaits me.

951
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,033
Good healthy appetite.

952
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:22,247
Oh, I'll catch up with you guys.
I think I left my watch inside.

953
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:25,292
Hey. Let's just wait a second.

954
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:32,633
Dr Manhattan: / cross the room
to the intrinsic field center.

955
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,051
I find my watch.

956
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:41,725
When I get to the door,

957
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:44,603
Wally is turning white.

958
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:48,315
The program's locked in.
We can't override the time lock.

959
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:51,777
I am terrified.

960
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,403
Jon?

961
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:00,035
I'm sorry, Jon,

962
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:03,664
but I can't...

963
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:07,584
Janey, don't leave me!

964
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:09,753
Don't leave me!

965
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:45,956
It is may 12th, 1959,
when I'm introduced to janey.

966
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:49,793
She buys me a beer,

967
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:52,170
the first time a woman
has done this for me.

968
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:56,842
As she passes me the cold,
perspiring glass,

969
01:24:58,552 --> 01:24:59,636
our fingers touch.

970
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:14,860
Yes, Jon, good.

971
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:17,946
Now it's just a question
of reassembling the components

972
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:19,906
in the correct sequence.

973
01:25:24,369 --> 01:25:25,704
Dr Manhattan: / feel fear

974
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:27,956
for the last time.

975
01:25:45,682 --> 01:25:48,101
A token funeral is held.

976
01:25:48,185 --> 01:25:50,354
There is nothing to Bury.

977
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:53,315
Janey frames the snapshot.

978
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:56,068
It's the only photograph of me
anyone has.

979
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:01,490
A circulatory system is seen
by the perimeter fence.

980
01:26:03,033 --> 01:26:04,576
A few days later,

981
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:07,954
a partially muscled skeleton
stands in the hallway

982
01:26:08,038 --> 01:26:10,290
and screams for a moment
before vanishing.

983
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:38,485
Oh, god.

984
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:40,737
Jon?

985
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:43,448
Is that you?

986
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:46,326
Nations around the world
still reeling

987
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,595
from this morning's announcement,

988
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:50,247
possibly the most significant event
in recent history.

989
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:54,626
We repeat, the Superman exists,
and he is American.

990
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,551
They call me dr Manhattan.

991
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:07,639
They explain the name
has been chosen

992
01:27:07,973 --> 01:27:11,059
for the ominous associations
it will raise in america's enemies.

993
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:19,484
The marketing boys say I need a logo.

994
01:27:29,035 --> 01:27:30,537
If I'm to have a symbol,

995
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:35,041
it shall be one I respect.

996
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:48,346
They are shaping me
into something gaudy,

997
01:27:50,223 --> 01:27:51,475
something lethal.

998
01:27:57,147 --> 01:27:59,232
In January, 1971,

999
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:02,944
president Nixon asks me
to intervene in Vietnam,

1000
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:06,907
something that his predecessors
would not ask.

1001
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:09,743
A week later, the conflict ends.

1002
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:14,331
Some of the Vietcong forces
wanna surrender to me personally.

1003
01:28:18,752 --> 01:28:21,755
Hollis Mason, a retired costume hero,
writes a book.

1004
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:26,760
In it, he calls my arrival
the dawn of the superhero.

1005
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:30,430
I am not sure if I know
what that means.

1006
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:49,950
Wally: You see, at the time,
I was misquoted.

1007
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:54,037
I never said, "the Superman exists
and he is American."

1008
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:57,207
What I said was, "god exists,

1009
01:28:58,083 --> 01:28:59,376
"and he is American."

1010
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:02,110
Now, if you begin to feel
an intense

1011
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:05,966
and crushing feeling of
religious terror at the concept,

1012
01:29:07,634 --> 01:29:08,760
don't be alarmed.

1013
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:13,223
That indicates only
that you are still sane.

1014
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:19,145
Dr Manhattan: It is Christmas, 1963.

1015
01:29:20,146 --> 01:29:23,108
Janey tells me she is afraid,
and worried.

1016
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:26,570
She says I am like a god now.

1017
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:29,990
I tell her
I don't think there is a god.

1018
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:32,200
And if there is, I'm nothing like him.

1019
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,332
I tell her! Still want her

1020
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:42,335
and that I always will.

1021
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:50,135
As I lie to her,
it is September 4th, 1970.

1022
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:54,389
I am in a room
full of people wearing disguises.

1023
01:29:56,016 --> 01:30:00,103
A very young girl
looks at me and smiles.

1024
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:03,523
She's beautiful.

1025
01:30:07,611 --> 01:30:08,987
After each long kiss,

1026
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:12,365
she plants a smaller,
gentler one upon my lips,

1027
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:14,868
like a signature.

1028
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:19,205
Janey accuses me of chasing jailbait.

1029
01:30:20,206 --> 01:30:22,083
She bursts into angry tears,

1030
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:24,669
asking if it's because
she's getting older.

1031
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:26,880
It's true.

1032
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:31,676
She's aging more noticeably
every day,

1033
01:30:39,309 --> 01:30:40,936
While I am standing still.

1034
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:44,773
I prefer the stillness here.

1035
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:47,984
I am tired of earth.

1036
01:30:48,944 --> 01:30:50,028
These people.

1037
01:30:51,321 --> 01:30:54,074
I'm tired of being caught
in the tangle of their lives.

1038
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:20,475
They claim their labours
are to build a heaven.

1039
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:24,020
Yet their heaven is populated
with horrors.

1040
01:31:25,563 --> 01:31:27,649
Perhaps the world is not made.

1041
01:31:29,234 --> 01:31:30,568
Perhaps nothing is made.

1042
01:31:31,987 --> 01:31:34,572
A clock without a craftsman.

1043
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:37,867
It's too late.

1044
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:40,161
Always has been,

1045
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:44,833
always will be too late.

1046
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:49,417
Forbes: And you have no idea
where he would've gone.

1047
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:51,297
Laurie: How would I know?

1048
01:31:51,798 --> 01:31:54,638
Probably on the other side of the
world studying molecules or something.

1049
01:31:54,718 --> 01:31:57,158
Forbes: Our satellites have done
a sweep of the entire planet.

1050
01:31:57,220 --> 01:31:59,431
There's no trace of his
energy signature anywhere.

1051
01:31:59,806 --> 01:32:00,932
Really?

1052
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:04,477
Miss Jupiter, did you and
dr Manhattan have a fight today?

1053
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:06,333
That's none of your fucking business.

1054
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:09,441
It is when you're on government
payroll and you're not doing your job.

1055
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:11,877
That's as close to the word "whore"

1056
01:32:11,901 --> 01:32:13,611
as you're gonna get with me,
agent Forbes.

1057
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:23,830
Smoke?

1058
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:26,082
My apologies, miss Jupiter.

1059
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:29,669
You know how important dr Manhattan
is to our national security.

1060
01:32:31,254 --> 01:32:32,505
You can imagine our concern.

1061
01:32:33,465 --> 01:32:34,674
I can only imagine.

1062
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:43,200
Edward: Ain't nothing gonna matter
once those nukes start flying.

1063
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:45,143
We'll all be dust.

1064
01:32:45,435 --> 01:32:47,896
Then ozymandias here

1065
01:32:48,438 --> 01:32:51,149
will be the smartest man
on the cinder.

1066
01:33:09,459 --> 01:33:12,587
Laurel? Laurel Jane?

1067
01:33:14,631 --> 01:33:15,965
You're Sally Jupiter's kid.

1068
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:18,384
You're the comedian, right?

1069
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:20,929
You were pretty cool in there.

1070
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:25,391
You know, your mom, she was one
of the all-time champion beauties.

1071
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:27,894
You got her eyes, you know.

1072
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,064
You even have that same
funny little mole.

1073
01:33:31,397 --> 01:33:32,857
Take your hands off her.

1074
01:33:33,358 --> 01:33:35,193
Hey, doll. Long time no see.

1075
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:39,197
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
Get in the car.

1076
01:33:40,949 --> 01:33:43,034
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

1077
01:33:43,118 --> 01:33:45,829
Jesus Christ, Sally.
Can't a guy talk to his...

1078
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:49,165
You know, old friend's daughter?

1079
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:51,459
I mean, what the hell
do you think I am?

1080
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:52,836
Man: We found him!

1081
01:33:56,506 --> 01:33:57,986
- We found him.
- Forbes: Where is he?

1082
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:03,221
Mars.

1083
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:10,687
Mr president,

1084
01:34:11,312 --> 01:34:15,859
the Soviets have moved their tanks
just short of the Afghan border.

1085
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:18,903
They are testing us

1086
01:34:18,987 --> 01:34:23,575
to see if we manufactured
dr Manhattan's disappearance

1087
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:26,578
to coax a move out of them.

1088
01:34:26,995 --> 01:34:28,597
General 1:
If they realise it's not a hoax,

1089
01:34:28,621 --> 01:34:30,498
they'll probably start
with air strikes.

1090
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:32,125
If they do,

1091
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:35,503
they'll have Afghanistan
under control in a matter of days.

1092
01:34:35,587 --> 01:34:40,216
A watchdog group of nuclear scientists
has moved the doomsday clock

1093
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:42,302
to two minutes until midnight.

1094
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:45,555
Nixon: Get this shit off the screen.

1095
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:49,267
Who are these assholes to say
when doomsday approaches?

1096
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:51,686
I say when doomsday is approaching.

1097
01:34:57,567 --> 01:34:58,818
Now, then.

1098
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:02,572
What about the rest
of the Warsaw pact countries?

1099
01:35:02,655 --> 01:35:04,991
Czechoslovakia,
Poland and east Germany

1100
01:35:05,074 --> 01:35:06,492
have mobilised their forces.

1101
01:35:07,202 --> 01:35:10,079
But no movement yet.
They're playing a wait-and-see.

1102
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:11,873
Letting the Russians take the lead.

1103
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:18,087
Bold moves, Henry.

1104
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:19,672
That's what's needed right now.

1105
01:35:19,756 --> 01:35:22,508
We can't let these fuckers
think we're weak.

1106
01:35:22,675 --> 01:35:27,013
Yes. They must fear the madman
Richard Nixon.

1107
01:35:32,143 --> 01:35:35,855
How soon can we be ready
for a pre-emptive strike?

1108
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:38,149
Two days.

1109
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:42,153
We have a 54% chance
of wiping out the entire ussr

1110
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:43,988
before they get
their missiles airborne.

1111
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:47,533
What would our losses be?

1112
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:49,744
Assuming conservative projections

1113
01:35:49,827 --> 01:35:52,664
of how many Soviet warheads
are destroyed beforehand,

1114
01:35:53,248 --> 01:35:55,083
we'll lose all of the east coast.

1115
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:57,252
The last gasp

1116
01:35:57,919 --> 01:35:59,379
of the Harvard establishment.

1117
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:03,216
Let's see them think their way
out of fission.

1118
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:07,345
With anticipated wind patterns,
the fallout drift would head south.

1119
01:36:08,137 --> 01:36:09,764
Mexico would catch the worst of it.

1120
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:12,850
Most of the farm belt
might remain unaffected.

1121
01:36:12,934 --> 01:36:14,102
Not so bad,

1122
01:36:15,228 --> 01:36:17,397
all things considered.

1123
01:36:19,816 --> 01:36:20,942
General 2: Mr president,

1124
01:36:21,818 --> 01:36:22,986
what would you like to do?

1125
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:33,621
Take us to defcon two.

1126
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:35,790
Begin fuelling the bombers.

1127
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,960
Dr Manhattan has two days.

1128
01:36:40,378 --> 01:36:41,754
After that,

1129
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:45,675
humanity is in the hands
of a higher authority than mine.

1130
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:48,428
Let's just hope he's on our side.

1131
01:36:50,722 --> 01:36:51,824
Forbes: There must be
some way to reach him.

1132
01:36:51,848 --> 01:36:52,849
Laurie: Excuse me.

1133
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:54,892
Forbes: Radio transmission,
space shuttles...

1134
01:36:54,976 --> 01:36:56,036
Laurie: Excuse me. Forbes: What?

1135
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,729
I need to use the restroom.

1136
01:37:20,043 --> 01:37:21,627
Don't you understand?

1137
01:37:21,794 --> 01:37:24,255
The only thing that can
bring Jon back is Jon.

1138
01:37:24,589 --> 01:37:26,132
If he wants to find me, he will.

1139
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:28,426
I've been a prisoner in my life
long enough.

1140
01:37:29,719 --> 01:37:31,346
Iacocca: Without dr Manhattan around

1141
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:34,307
to bully the Russians into peace,
mr veidt,

1142
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:38,603
people are going to need good,
old-fashioned energy to rely on.

1143
01:37:39,187 --> 01:37:40,646
You can understand.

1144
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:45,568
The world can't just quit on oil
and nuclear power cold Turkey.

1145
01:37:46,361 --> 01:37:48,571
You'll dismantle
our entire economy overnight.

1146
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:51,032
You're right, Lee.
And why free energy?

1147
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:54,202
Well, "free" is just another word
for "socialist."

1148
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:56,829
We mightjust have to
make a public inquiry

1149
01:37:56,913 --> 01:38:00,124
into any past communist
affiliations you might have had.

1150
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:03,336
Mr iacocca, gentlemen,

1151
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:06,005
I respect your position

1152
01:38:07,006 --> 01:38:09,675
and what you've accomplished
as captains of industry. I do.

1153
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:13,262
You wanna know my past? Hmm?

1154
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:16,099
Okay. Happily.

1155
01:38:17,392 --> 01:38:19,060
It's a matter of public record
that by 17,

1156
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:20,561
both my parents were dead,

1157
01:38:21,062 --> 01:38:22,313
leaving me alone.

1158
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:27,026
I guess you could say
I've always been alone.

1159
01:38:27,443 --> 01:38:29,254
I mean, they say I'm the smartest man
in the world,

1160
01:38:29,278 --> 01:38:32,031
but the truth is
I've often felt stupid

1161
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:35,535
at being unable
to relate to anyone.

1162
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,788
Well, anyone living, that is.

1163
01:38:39,664 --> 01:38:41,541
The only person with whom
I felt any kinship

1164
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:44,460
died 300 years
before the birth of Christ.

1165
01:38:45,211 --> 01:38:46,921
Alexander of Macedonia,

1166
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:49,799
or Alexander the great,
as you know him.

1167
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,804
His vision of a united world was...

1168
01:38:55,721 --> 01:38:57,890
Well, it was unprecedented.

1169
01:38:59,016 --> 01:39:00,184
I wanted...

1170
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:03,271
Needed to match
his accomplishments.

1171
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:06,774
And so I resolved to apply antiquity's
teachings to our world today.

1172
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:09,861
And so began my path to conquest.

1173
01:39:10,069 --> 01:39:12,405
Conquest not of men,

1174
01:39:13,614 --> 01:39:15,324
but of the evils that beset them.

1175
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:21,456
Fossil fuels, oil, nuclear power

1176
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:25,001
are like a drug, and you gentlemen,
along with foreign interests,

1177
01:39:25,084 --> 01:39:26,752
- are the pushers.
- Now, listen.

1178
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:28,129
Adrian: No.

1179
01:39:31,048 --> 01:39:32,425
You listen.

1180
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:35,553
The world will survive,

1181
01:39:36,762 --> 01:39:39,724
and it deserves more
than you've been able to provide.

1182
01:39:40,349 --> 01:39:42,018
So let's cut to it, shall we?

1183
01:39:43,269 --> 01:39:45,855
Privately, I'm worth more than
all of your corporations combined.

1184
01:39:45,938 --> 01:39:47,607
I could buy and sell you,
three times over

1185
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:49,626
which is something you should factor
into your decision,

1186
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:54,989
should you choose
to make our disagreement public.

1187
01:39:57,450 --> 01:39:58,784
I think you know the way out.

1188
01:40:01,621 --> 01:40:02,830
Gentlemen.

1189
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:07,418
The toy people wanna talk to you about

1190
01:40:07,502 --> 01:40:09,212
some new villains
for the ozymandias line.

1191
01:40:09,629 --> 01:40:12,256
- Seems all the old villains are dead.
- Mr veidt?

1192
01:40:13,132 --> 01:40:15,885
- I think I have some ideas.
- Mr veidt?

1193
01:40:16,928 --> 01:40:19,138
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

1194
01:40:58,886 --> 01:41:00,513
He's got a poison capsule.

1195
01:41:00,638 --> 01:41:02,557
Don't bite down, you son of a bitch.

1196
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,934
Who sent you? I want a name.

1197
01:41:05,726 --> 01:41:06,727
Give me a name!

1198
01:41:19,031 --> 01:41:20,199
Laurie: Suicide pill.

1199
01:41:21,325 --> 01:41:24,078
Potassium cyanide.
Guy was dead before he hit the ground.

1200
01:41:24,412 --> 01:41:25,538
Waitress: Thanks, hon.

1201
01:41:26,706 --> 01:41:28,040
Then rorschach was right.

1202
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:30,585
This wasn't some lone nut.

1203
01:41:31,377 --> 01:41:32,503
It's an organisation,

1204
01:41:33,254 --> 01:41:35,423
well-funded, well-equipped.

1205
01:41:36,382 --> 01:41:38,134
But who would wanna kill us now?

1206
01:41:39,594 --> 01:41:42,513
I don't know,
but it's not safe out here.

1207
01:41:48,394 --> 01:41:50,313
So, er, no word from Jon?

1208
01:41:53,232 --> 01:41:55,401
Well, listen, erm,

1209
01:41:55,484 --> 01:41:57,028
Why don't you come stay with me?

1210
01:41:58,696 --> 01:41:59,905
Oh, no.

1211
01:42:00,323 --> 01:42:02,199
That's sweet,
but I wouldn't wanna impose.

1212
01:42:02,283 --> 01:42:03,659
Oh, no. No.

1213
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:05,661
Think of it as doing me a favour.

1214
01:42:07,288 --> 01:42:09,373
I wouldn't have to worry
about you being out there.

1215
01:42:12,918 --> 01:42:14,211
Okay.

1216
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:22,178
Rorschach: Rorschach's journal,
October 21st, 1985.

1217
01:42:23,054 --> 01:42:26,891
On 43rd and 7th, saw dreiberg
and Jupiter leaving diner.

1218
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:30,019
They didn't know me without my mask.

1219
01:42:31,354 --> 01:42:32,730
An affair?

1220
01:42:33,272 --> 01:42:36,108
Did she break Manhattan's heart
to engineer his exile,

1221
01:42:36,192 --> 01:42:37,818
to make room for dreiberg?

1222
01:42:39,445 --> 01:42:41,989
Does Manhattan even have a heart
to break?

1223
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:46,452
The alley was cold, deserted.

1224
01:42:46,994 --> 01:42:50,790
My things were where I left them,
waiting for me.

1225
01:42:51,707 --> 01:42:56,379
My coat, my shoes, my spotless gloves.

1226
01:42:57,630 --> 01:42:58,881
My face.

1227
01:42:59,757 --> 01:43:03,052
Putting them on,
I abandoned my disguise,

1228
01:43:04,053 --> 01:43:05,137
became myself.

1229
01:43:06,639 --> 01:43:08,933
Free from fear or weakness

1230
01:43:09,767 --> 01:43:10,893
or lust.

1231
01:43:12,478 --> 01:43:13,979
Down alley,

1232
01:43:14,563 --> 01:43:15,940
heard woman scream.

1233
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:19,485
First bubbling note
of the city's evening chorus.

1234
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:22,279
Attempted rape.

1235
01:43:22,738 --> 01:43:25,408
Mugging. Both.

1236
01:43:27,034 --> 01:43:28,369
The man turned,

1237
01:43:28,828 --> 01:43:31,330
and there was something
rewarding in his eyes.

1238
01:43:32,957 --> 01:43:35,292
Sometimes the night is generous to me.

1239
01:43:41,632 --> 01:43:45,344
Veidt's assassin was a local lowlife
named Roy chess.

1240
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:48,639
At his apartment, I found clues.

1241
01:43:50,141 --> 01:43:53,227
Seems he worked
at pyramid transnational.

1242
01:43:53,728 --> 01:43:55,604
I'd seen the logo before.

1243
01:43:56,647 --> 01:43:58,232
At moloch's.

1244
01:44:29,305 --> 01:44:32,224
Someone tried to shoot the world's
smartest man today, moloch.

1245
01:44:32,933 --> 01:44:35,019
Guy worked for pyramid transnational.

1246
01:44:35,644 --> 01:44:37,813
More than just a delivery service,
I take it.

1247
01:44:38,230 --> 01:44:39,791
Last time I was here,
I saw a pension check

1248
01:44:39,815 --> 01:44:41,484
written from the same company.

1249
01:44:42,443 --> 01:44:45,446
I'm guessing it's a front set up
by whoever wants us masks dead.

1250
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:48,908
Now, no more lies, moloch.
Who runs pyramid?

1251
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:55,623
Fine: Rorschach.

1252
01:44:56,123 --> 01:44:58,584
This is the police.
We know you're in there.

1253
01:44:58,876 --> 01:45:00,711
No. No!

1254
01:45:00,795 --> 01:45:03,798
If there's anybody in there with you,
send them out unharmed.

1255
01:45:05,299 --> 01:45:06,675
No. No, no, no!

1256
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:08,987
Fine: Come on.
Let's make it a nice, clean surrender.

1257
01:45:09,011 --> 01:45:11,347
Walked right into it.
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

1258
01:45:11,430 --> 01:45:13,307
Never, never surrender.

1259
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:16,644
Fine: All right.
Lhope you're ready, hero.

1260
01:45:16,811 --> 01:45:18,020
When you are.

1261
01:45:40,626 --> 01:45:41,669
One,

1262
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:52,555
Three.

1263
01:46:43,898 --> 01:46:45,482
- Officer: Get him!
- Come on.

1264
01:46:56,827 --> 01:46:58,370
Man: Son of a bitch.

1265
01:46:59,747 --> 01:47:02,082
- Christ, he stinks.
- Get that mask off him.

1266
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:05,044
- I got it.
- No.No!

1267
01:47:05,127 --> 01:47:07,588
My face! Give me back my face!

1268
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:10,966
The masked vigilante,
rorschach, was apprehended

1269
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:13,135
and he's been identified
as Walter kovacs,

1270
01:47:13,218 --> 01:47:15,179
a 35-year-old white male.

1271
01:47:15,387 --> 01:47:17,991
Little's yet known about kovacs,
but he was charged with the murder

1272
01:47:18,015 --> 01:47:19,391
of one Edgar jacobi,

1273
01:47:19,475 --> 01:47:22,394
found shot in the head at point blank
range in his home in the Bronx.

1274
01:47:22,478 --> 01:47:25,522
Several police officers were injured
and jacobi's home was set ablaze

1275
01:47:25,606 --> 01:47:27,524
during the violent course
of the capture.

1276
01:47:32,363 --> 01:47:33,739
Inmate 1: Rorschach!

1277
01:47:33,822 --> 01:47:36,617
I'm gonna fuck you
like I fucked your mother!

1278
01:47:43,874 --> 01:47:46,126
Inmate 2: Come on out, rorschach!

1279
01:47:49,672 --> 01:47:51,423
Bernie: I knew this guy was a kook.

1280
01:47:53,425 --> 01:47:54,635
But rorschach...

1281
01:47:54,718 --> 01:47:57,054
Usually I got an intuition
about these kind of things.

1282
01:47:57,721 --> 01:48:00,201
- Thought the dude would be bigger.
- It goes to show you, kid,

1283
01:48:00,265 --> 01:48:02,226
- you never know.
- Hey, let me get a gazette.

1284
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:06,188
Yeah. Hey, you see this?
He was a customer of mine.

1285
01:48:06,271 --> 01:48:08,691
- Used to come here all the time.
- No shit?

1286
01:48:11,151 --> 01:48:13,362
Man: Hey, Bernie. Did you hear the news?

1287
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:26,125
Mariner: Whoever we are,
wherever we reside,

1288
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:28,919
we exist on the whim of murderers.

1289
01:48:34,591 --> 01:48:37,344
I hardly recognised
my old friend Ridley.

1290
01:48:37,553 --> 01:48:39,263
I could not bring myself to tell him

1291
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:42,141
he was a horrible reflection
of his former self.

1292
01:48:43,225 --> 01:48:46,979
I really must get him home before...
Before he gets any worse.

1293
01:48:47,896 --> 01:48:49,356
Before he succumbs.

1294
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:52,609
I've heard that on
less than a pint daily,

1295
01:48:52,693 --> 01:48:55,779
a man might survive
drinking saltwater.

1296
01:48:56,196 --> 01:48:57,322
Ridley: Captain?

1297
01:48:57,656 --> 01:48:59,241
What are you doing, captain?

1298
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:04,580
I'm headed for davidstown.
That's what.

1299
01:49:05,039 --> 01:49:07,666
I need to warn... to warn everyone.

1300
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:13,630
You think you'll reach davidstown
in advance of the black freighter?

1301
01:49:14,089 --> 01:49:17,801
Isolation has made you mad, captain.
Mad, indeed.

1302
01:49:19,303 --> 01:49:20,637
But we must try.

1303
01:49:20,721 --> 01:49:21,972
You are a fool.

1304
01:49:22,056 --> 01:49:24,475
You alone survived
the freighter's attack.

1305
01:49:24,850 --> 01:49:29,104
Fortune has smiled upon you,
and you spit in its face.

1306
01:49:29,313 --> 01:49:31,106
Turn your wretched craft around

1307
01:49:31,190 --> 01:49:34,610
and go far away,
as far away as you can.

1308
01:49:36,653 --> 01:49:40,240
No. No, my family.
I must protect them.

1309
01:49:41,867 --> 01:49:43,619
The black freighter is already there.

1310
01:49:44,495 --> 01:49:45,871
Your wife, dead.

1311
01:49:46,330 --> 01:49:48,707
- Your children, dead.
- Shut your mouth.

1312
01:49:48,916 --> 01:49:53,337
You have failed your family,
like you have failed your crew.

1313
01:50:14,608 --> 01:50:18,278
You'll end up dead like them.
You give your life in vain.

1314
01:50:18,362 --> 01:50:19,947
I give my life in nobility.

1315
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:24,576
Even if I fail in my attempt,

1316
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:27,913
I take solace in the fact that
I will see my family again in heaven.

1317
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:29,498
Heaven?

1318
01:50:29,957 --> 01:50:31,583
Oh, there is no heaven, captain.

1319
01:50:32,626 --> 01:50:33,836
Believe me, sir.

1320
01:50:34,962 --> 01:50:36,380
I would know by now.

1321
01:50:43,804 --> 01:50:45,013
Man: Walter kovacs.

1322
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:47,558
Is that your name? Walter?

1323
01:50:48,517 --> 01:50:51,687
Well, let me explain
your situation here, Walter.

1324
01:50:52,771 --> 01:50:54,398
You cooperate with me,

1325
01:50:54,481 --> 01:50:58,777
and I may be able to convince them
that you should be treated medically.

1326
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:02,239
In a hospital. I believe
that'd be good for you.

1327
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:06,118
But the authorities wanna put you

1328
01:51:06,743 --> 01:51:08,829
with the general population.

1329
01:51:09,830 --> 01:51:12,624
- Prison's a prison.
- Uh-huh. Yes.

1330
01:51:13,542 --> 01:51:15,794
But the difference is, down there,

1331
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:18,881
you'd be eaten alive.

1332
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:23,510
You're responsible for a lot of them
being in prison here, Walter.

1333
01:51:27,097 --> 01:51:28,390
Tell me what you see.

1334
01:51:33,937 --> 01:51:35,147
A pretty butterfly.

1335
01:51:39,276 --> 01:51:40,861
What about now? What do you see here?

1336
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:47,326
Mom?

1337
01:51:47,534 --> 01:51:48,744
Is he hurting you?

1338
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:50,621
You got a fucking kid in here.

1339
01:51:51,205 --> 01:51:52,456
I get that at home.

1340
01:51:52,539 --> 01:51:55,250
Bastard.
I should have had that abortion.

1341
01:52:05,552 --> 01:52:06,845
Some nice flowers.

1342
01:52:12,809 --> 01:52:14,645
Boy 1: I heard this guy's mom's a whore.

1343
01:52:17,147 --> 01:52:19,566
Did you catch any diseases from her?

1344
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:21,693
Huh? Whoreson.

1345
01:52:22,611 --> 01:52:24,655
Listen to me, retard.

1346
01:52:25,948 --> 01:52:28,325
Boy 2: Hey, you think she'd suck my dick
for a dollar?

1347
01:52:47,803 --> 01:52:48,971
Clouds.

1348
01:52:54,017 --> 01:52:56,687
Tell me about rorschach.
Will you do that, Walter?

1349
01:52:57,020 --> 01:53:00,232
You keep calling me Walter.
I don't like you.

1350
01:53:01,566 --> 01:53:03,026
You don't like me.

1351
01:53:03,777 --> 01:53:05,612
All right, why is that, exactly?

1352
01:53:05,904 --> 01:53:06,947
You're fat.

1353
01:53:07,823 --> 01:53:10,450
Wealthy. Liberal sensibilities.

1354
01:53:11,034 --> 01:53:12,577
What you call compassion.

1355
01:53:13,203 --> 01:53:15,497
Wanting to protect
and understand the guilty.

1356
01:53:15,580 --> 01:53:18,917
This rotting society,
what it calls rehabilitation.

1357
01:53:19,668 --> 01:53:21,169
Nothing short of compromise.

1358
01:53:21,336 --> 01:53:23,797
Is it a compromise
to want to make you well?

1359
01:53:24,089 --> 01:53:25,650
There are other men in here
with behaviour

1360
01:53:25,674 --> 01:53:27,551
more extreme than mine, doctor.

1361
01:53:28,969 --> 01:53:31,346
Of course, they're not famous,
are they?

1362
01:53:32,472 --> 01:53:33,932
You wanna know about rorschach?

1363
01:53:36,601 --> 01:53:37,978
I'll tell you about rorschach.

1364
01:53:39,688 --> 01:53:42,316
Once a man has seen society's
black underbelly,

1365
01:53:42,399 --> 01:53:44,318
he can never turn his back on it.

1366
01:53:45,068 --> 01:53:47,529
Never pretend, like you do,

1367
01:53:47,904 --> 01:53:49,156
that it doesn't exist,

1368
01:53:49,239 --> 01:53:51,908
no matter who orders him
to look the other way.

1369
01:53:52,492 --> 01:53:55,620
We don't do this thing

1370
01:53:55,996 --> 01:53:57,497
because it's permitted.

1371
01:53:59,124 --> 01:54:00,500
We do it because we have to.

1372
01:54:02,252 --> 01:54:04,087
We do it 'cause we're compelled.

1373
01:54:06,298 --> 01:54:08,592
I was investigating a kidnap case.

1374
01:54:10,635 --> 01:54:11,970
Blaire roche.

1375
01:54:12,721 --> 01:54:14,097
Six-year-old girl.

1376
01:54:14,973 --> 01:54:16,183
I was young then.

1377
01:54:16,933 --> 01:54:18,435
Too soft on criminals.

1378
01:54:20,187 --> 01:54:21,480
I let them live.

1379
01:54:23,065 --> 01:54:25,108
Broke a man's arm to get a tip.

1380
01:54:25,859 --> 01:54:27,986
Led me to the missing girl's location.

1381
01:54:36,495 --> 01:54:37,871
I knew the girl was here,

1382
01:54:39,206 --> 01:54:41,625
but when I searched the place,
I saw nothing.

1383
01:54:43,543 --> 01:54:44,961
And then I found her.

1384
01:55:35,137 --> 01:55:36,430
Man: Fred.

1385
01:55:37,931 --> 01:55:39,182
Barney.

1386
01:55:40,058 --> 01:55:41,726
Who's gonna bark for daddy?

1387
01:55:48,108 --> 01:55:50,485
Rorschach: It was dark
when the murderer got back.

1388
01:55:53,029 --> 01:55:54,614
As dark as it gets.

1389
01:56:33,487 --> 01:56:34,779
Oh, god.

1390
01:56:35,363 --> 01:56:37,949
Who's out there? Who is it?

1391
01:56:40,076 --> 01:56:41,953
Who is it?

1392
01:56:51,963 --> 01:56:55,258
What? What the fuck?
Who the fuck are you?

1393
01:56:55,592 --> 01:56:57,010
What the fuck do you want?

1394
01:56:58,136 --> 01:57:00,055
You killed my dogs, man!

1395
01:57:04,893 --> 01:57:07,062
You think I had something
to do with that girl?

1396
01:57:08,230 --> 01:57:09,397
I found that.

1397
01:57:09,856 --> 01:57:12,359
What evidence have you got?
That's nothing.

1398
01:57:19,991 --> 01:57:22,536
Okay. I confess.

1399
01:57:24,246 --> 01:57:26,498
I kidnapped her. I killed her.

1400
01:57:27,541 --> 01:57:28,583
Arrest me.

1401
01:57:28,917 --> 01:57:32,045
What? Arrest me!

1402
01:57:32,420 --> 01:57:34,214
I did it! I said I did it!

1403
01:57:35,840 --> 01:57:36,883
Christ.

1404
01:57:36,967 --> 01:57:38,885
Look, I've got a problem, man.

1405
01:57:38,969 --> 01:57:41,429
Fucking take me in. I need help.

1406
01:57:42,013 --> 01:57:44,349
No, don't. Don't do that.

1407
01:57:44,432 --> 01:57:48,937
Take me in. Don't! No!

1408
01:57:53,608 --> 01:57:55,986
Rorschach: Men get arrested.

1409
01:57:58,655 --> 01:58:00,365
Dogs get put down.

1410
01:58:08,373 --> 01:58:10,333
Tremors of impact shook my arm.

1411
01:58:12,335 --> 01:58:13,962
Warm blood splashed my face.

1412
01:58:15,839 --> 01:58:19,217
Whatever was left of Walter kovacs
died that night with that little girl.

1413
01:58:21,011 --> 01:58:23,096
From then on,
there was only rorschach.

1414
01:58:24,764 --> 01:58:26,933
See, doctor, god didn't kill
that little girl.

1415
01:58:27,934 --> 01:58:31,521
Fate didn't butcher her and destiny
didn't feed her to those dogs.

1416
01:58:33,273 --> 01:58:36,359
If god saw what any of us did
that night, he didn't seem to mind.

1417
01:58:38,695 --> 01:58:40,030
From then on, I knew

1418
01:58:41,698 --> 01:58:43,533
god doesn't make the world this way.

1419
01:58:46,244 --> 01:58:47,579
We do.

1420
01:58:54,002 --> 01:58:55,545
I can't help him.

1421
01:59:08,391 --> 01:59:09,726
Hey, rorschach.

1422
01:59:11,102 --> 01:59:13,521
Hey, you're pretty famous, right?

1423
01:59:13,772 --> 01:59:15,899
Man 1: Rorschach, I heard
your mother was a whore.

1424
01:59:15,982 --> 01:59:19,027
Hey, you know what?
I'm pretty famous too.

1425
01:59:19,736 --> 01:59:22,405
- Ain't that right? That's right.
- Man 2: That's right.

1426
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:25,660
You know, maybe
I can give you an autograph, huh?

1427
01:59:26,284 --> 01:59:27,619
What you say, big boy?

1428
01:59:42,634 --> 01:59:44,386
None of you seem to understand.

1429
01:59:44,886 --> 01:59:47,526
- I'm not locked in here with you.
- Officer: All right, that's it!

1430
01:59:49,307 --> 01:59:51,267
You're locked in here with me.

1431
02:01:10,513 --> 02:01:11,598
Dan: Laurie!

1432
02:01:12,932 --> 02:01:13,975
Shit.

1433
02:01:14,976 --> 02:01:16,311
- Dan: Hold on.
- Fuck.

1434
02:01:20,064 --> 02:01:21,524
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1435
02:01:26,196 --> 02:01:29,699
I'm so sorry. I was snooping
and I must have hit the wrong button.

1436
02:01:29,783 --> 02:01:31,367
- Are you hurt?
- No, no.

1437
02:01:31,451 --> 02:01:34,496
- Okay.
- I'm fine. I just... I feel so bad.

1438
02:01:34,579 --> 02:01:36,331
No. No, don't worry.

1439
02:01:36,790 --> 02:01:40,001
It's happened before.
Comedian did it back in '77.

1440
02:01:41,169 --> 02:01:42,670
Archie survived that.

1441
02:01:43,379 --> 02:01:44,464
Laurie: Archie?

1442
02:01:45,507 --> 02:01:48,468
Oh. Well, er, short for Archimedes,

1443
02:01:49,302 --> 02:01:50,637
Merlin's pet owl.

1444
02:01:51,763 --> 02:01:53,139
Stupid nickname.

1445
02:01:54,641 --> 02:01:56,810
Laurie: How did you ever afford
all this stuff, anyway?

1446
02:01:57,477 --> 02:01:59,103
Well, my dad was in corporate banking

1447
02:01:59,187 --> 02:02:02,273
and, er, left me a lot of money
when he died,

1448
02:02:03,650 --> 02:02:06,611
which always surprised me.
I mean, he was, er...

1449
02:02:07,821 --> 02:02:10,365
I think he was disappointed
that I went into crime fighting

1450
02:02:10,448 --> 02:02:11,783
instead of following him.

1451
02:02:12,951 --> 02:02:14,786
Guess I was just more interested in

1452
02:02:15,829 --> 02:02:19,457
birds and airplanes, mythology and...

1453
02:02:20,416 --> 02:02:22,176
Plus, there were enough
other guys doing this

1454
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:24,420
so that I didn't feel ridiculous
about it.

1455
02:02:25,255 --> 02:02:26,548
Like Hollis.

1456
02:02:26,631 --> 02:02:27,632
Yeah.

1457
02:02:28,925 --> 02:02:30,885
Yeah, he was my hero.

1458
02:02:32,762 --> 02:02:34,973
Man, I remember the first time
that I met him

1459
02:02:35,056 --> 02:02:38,601
I, er, just felt so connected, you know?

1460
02:02:40,144 --> 02:02:41,604
To something that mattered.

1461
02:02:45,358 --> 02:02:47,402
Must be nice having a secret identity.

1462
02:02:48,987 --> 02:02:50,780
A secret place that nobody
knows about.

1463
02:02:50,864 --> 02:02:53,533
You can just come down here

1464
02:02:53,616 --> 02:02:56,327
and hang out without anyone
checking up on you.

1465
02:02:57,662 --> 02:02:59,038
Nobody watching you.

1466
02:03:03,084 --> 02:03:04,168
You wanna try those on?

1467
02:03:14,929 --> 02:03:16,222
There we go.

1468
02:03:19,851 --> 02:03:22,604
Wow, these rock.

1469
02:03:24,856 --> 02:03:26,441
They amplify the spectral range.

1470
02:03:27,692 --> 02:03:29,027
Thermal imagings.

1471
02:03:31,029 --> 02:03:32,697
They work even better in the dark.

1472
02:03:37,952 --> 02:03:39,412
You can see me, right?

1473
02:03:42,081 --> 02:03:43,583
I can see everything.

1474
02:03:47,462 --> 02:03:50,381
I remember, no matter
how black it got,

1475
02:03:51,132 --> 02:03:52,692
whenever I looked
through those goggles,

1476
02:03:52,717 --> 02:03:54,469
everything was as clear as day.

1477
02:03:57,639 --> 02:03:59,807
This must be the way
Jon sees the world.

1478
02:04:02,352 --> 02:04:04,812
We should probably head up.
Food's getting cold.

1479
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:06,898
Put those away when you're done.

1480
02:04:16,449 --> 02:04:19,243
Man: Soviet ambassador
to the UN had no comment

1481
02:04:19,327 --> 02:04:22,121
when asked if dr Manhattan's
disappearance

1482
02:04:22,205 --> 02:04:24,040
has fuelled Soviet aggression
in Afghanistan.

1483
02:04:24,123 --> 02:04:25,333
Dan.

1484
02:04:26,542 --> 02:04:27,877
Jon sees a lot of things,

1485
02:04:30,630 --> 02:04:32,006
but he doesn't see me.

1486
02:04:39,931 --> 02:04:41,182
Well, er...

1487
02:05:35,069 --> 02:05:36,154
Sorry.

1488
02:05:38,489 --> 02:05:39,490
Come here.

1489
02:05:45,788 --> 02:05:46,873
What's the matter?

1490
02:05:46,956 --> 02:05:49,500
- If you could just move a little...
- Okay

1491
02:05:49,584 --> 02:05:51,627
yeah. There you go.

1492
02:05:58,509 --> 02:06:00,970
Dan, what's wrong?

1493
02:06:02,680 --> 02:06:03,848
Sorry, I, er...

1494
02:06:05,975 --> 02:06:07,643
Yeah, I just need a couple minutes.

1495
02:06:10,521 --> 02:06:11,731
Oh, hell.

1496
02:06:14,192 --> 02:06:15,193
It's okay.

1497
02:06:17,361 --> 02:06:20,907
Maybe we were just moving too fast.

1498
02:06:25,328 --> 02:06:26,996
We've got all the time in the world.

1499
02:06:29,373 --> 02:06:30,792
We'll take it slow.

1500
02:06:45,223 --> 02:06:47,100
It's been a long time, rorschach.

1501
02:06:48,518 --> 02:06:49,769
Rorschach: Big figure.

1502
02:06:50,394 --> 02:06:51,479
Small world.

1503
02:06:53,564 --> 02:06:54,774
I like that.

1504
02:06:55,817 --> 02:06:57,610
But you know, it is
a small world in here.

1505
02:06:58,653 --> 02:07:01,447
And I've been in it for,
how long now, Lloyd?

1506
02:07:01,531 --> 02:07:03,533
Lloyd: Almost 15 years, mr figure.

1507
02:07:03,616 --> 02:07:04,659
That's right.

1508
02:07:06,285 --> 02:07:09,288
Fifteen years since you
and that owl fella put me away.

1509
02:07:12,834 --> 02:07:17,213
So, rorschach,
that guy you burned is dying.

1510
02:07:17,296 --> 02:07:18,548
Could go any minute.

1511
02:07:19,465 --> 02:07:21,134
You know, by my count,

1512
02:07:21,217 --> 02:07:24,053
there are more than 50 people
in here that you put away.

1513
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:26,472
I've been talking to every one of them

1514
02:07:26,556 --> 02:07:29,183
and they're all dying
to get a piece of you.

1515
02:07:29,267 --> 02:07:32,270
This place is gonna explode!

1516
02:07:34,230 --> 02:07:36,607
Then, you die by inches.

1517
02:07:38,025 --> 02:07:39,443
Tall order.

1518
02:07:39,861 --> 02:07:41,654
I'm gonna tear this guy a new hole.

1519
02:07:42,989 --> 02:07:45,867
Relax, Lawrence. Soon.

1520
02:07:46,742 --> 02:07:47,952
Come on.

1521
02:09:22,004 --> 02:09:23,464
Mariner: Know this, my friends.

1522
02:09:24,215 --> 02:09:25,508
Hades is wet.

1523
02:09:26,634 --> 02:09:28,094
Hades is lonely.

1524
02:09:29,804 --> 02:09:31,097
({Grunts)

1525
02:09:44,235 --> 02:09:47,822
And in that instant,
we knew each other.

1526
02:10:24,275 --> 02:10:25,735
I'm sorry, my friend.

1527
02:10:46,714 --> 02:10:49,342
My raft had grown
increasingly grotesque,

1528
02:10:50,259 --> 02:10:52,595
reflecting my own transformation.

1529
02:11:06,817 --> 02:11:10,988
Adrift, my darkest imaginings
welled up unchecked,

1530
02:11:11,072 --> 02:11:14,283
spilling from brain to heart
like black ink,

1531
02:11:14,367 --> 02:11:15,951
impossible to remove.

1532
02:11:25,628 --> 02:11:28,631
The vessel had surely reached
davidstown already.

1533
02:11:29,465 --> 02:11:31,008
I pictured quiet streets

1534
02:11:31,092 --> 02:11:33,719
overrun by the fiends
from the black freighter.

1535
02:11:34,011 --> 02:11:37,306
My wife, my children,
most certainly dead.

1536
02:11:37,515 --> 02:11:39,183
My crew, dead.

1537
02:11:39,558 --> 02:11:42,395
The beast / ride on, dead.

1538
02:11:48,651 --> 02:11:52,071
More blood, more blood, more blood.

1539
02:12:09,463 --> 02:12:10,631
Girl: Father?

1540
02:12:10,714 --> 02:12:13,717
It can't be. Oh, lord, it can't be.

1541
02:12:13,801 --> 02:12:16,637
Father, help us. Please.

1542
02:12:16,929 --> 02:12:17,972
Mariner: Wait.

1543
02:12:19,849 --> 02:12:20,891
I'm coming.

1544
02:12:21,350 --> 02:12:22,518
Hurry, my dear.

1545
02:12:23,686 --> 02:12:26,439
Wait. Anyone but them.

1546
02:12:26,522 --> 02:12:27,523
Anyone.

1547
02:12:28,691 --> 02:12:29,859
Anyone.

1548
02:12:34,530 --> 02:12:36,824
I'd swallowed too much seawater.

1549
02:12:36,907 --> 02:12:39,410
I'd swallowed too much horror.

1550
02:12:43,247 --> 02:12:44,582
God has damned me.

1551
02:12:45,624 --> 02:12:47,751
God has damned us all.

1552
02:12:48,461 --> 02:12:54,008
Truly, life is hell, and death's
rough hand our only deliverance.

1553
02:12:55,176 --> 02:12:56,844
I can endure no more.

1554
02:12:57,386 --> 02:13:00,473
I want to join my family desperately.

1555
02:13:09,064 --> 02:13:10,483
Man: Yo, man.

1556
02:13:11,525 --> 02:13:12,693
What you reading?

1557
02:13:14,570 --> 02:13:15,654
Nothing, man.

1558
02:13:17,323 --> 02:13:19,909
- Nothing, huh?
- Hey, hey! You leave that kid alone!

1559
02:13:19,992 --> 02:13:21,577
Shut up, old man!

1560
02:13:30,586 --> 02:13:33,297
You're reading a comic book?
What are you, retarded?

1561
02:13:40,554 --> 02:13:43,307
Aw, hey, where you going, short bus?

1562
02:13:54,109 --> 02:13:55,236
Dan?

1563
02:14:02,034 --> 02:14:03,285
Is everything all right?

1564
02:14:06,038 --> 02:14:08,374
I'm tired of being afraid.

1565
02:14:10,167 --> 02:14:12,044
Afraid of war,

1566
02:14:13,295 --> 02:14:16,257
afraid of the mask killer,

1567
02:14:18,634 --> 02:14:21,095
and afraid of this goddamn suit

1568
02:14:21,929 --> 02:14:23,430
and how much I need it.

1569
02:14:24,723 --> 02:14:25,975
Me too.

1570
02:14:27,643 --> 02:14:29,019
Soto hell with it.

1571
02:14:30,145 --> 02:14:31,564
Let's take Archie out.

1572
02:14:37,403 --> 02:14:38,487
You're serious.

1573
02:14:38,571 --> 02:14:40,906
I used to be a masked avenger too,
remember?

1574
02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:42,717
I'm used to going out
at 3:00 in the morning

1575
02:14:42,741 --> 02:14:44,159
and doing something stupid.

1576
02:15:46,513 --> 02:15:48,575
Man:
Rapid burner. Be advised, all units.

1577
02:15:48,599 --> 02:15:50,893
Tenement fire at 5th and grand.
Rapid burner.

1578
02:15:50,976 --> 02:15:51,977
Let's go.

1579
02:15:57,316 --> 02:15:59,652
Laurie: I can see it.
Dan: All right, hold on.

1580
02:16:10,704 --> 02:16:11,931
Laurie: Dan, there are kids in there.

1581
02:16:11,955 --> 02:16:14,541
Everyone, please stay where you are!
Try to remain calm.

1582
02:16:14,625 --> 02:16:16,545
We're gonna get you out of there.

1583
02:16:16,669 --> 02:16:18,754
The roof's starting to cave.
Get me in there.

1584
02:16:18,837 --> 02:16:20,130
Dan: I'm gonna get you close.

1585
02:17:19,523 --> 02:17:20,733
Let's go.

1586
02:17:20,816 --> 02:17:22,025
Come on.

1587
02:17:22,276 --> 02:17:23,694
All right, let's move it, people.

1588
02:17:30,576 --> 02:17:34,538
Mom, is that guy in the space rocket,

1589
02:17:35,831 --> 02:17:37,374
isthatjesus?

1590
02:17:38,208 --> 02:17:39,543
No, baby.

1591
02:17:40,419 --> 02:17:42,004
Dan: Watch your step.
Laurie: All right.

1592
02:17:45,799 --> 02:17:46,842
We're all set.

1593
02:17:47,426 --> 02:17:49,261
Is that everyone?

1594
02:18:13,452 --> 02:18:15,078
Man: Bye. Girl: Bye!

1595
02:18:19,124 --> 02:18:20,564
Laurie: I can't believe we did that.

1596
02:18:22,628 --> 02:18:24,129
Probably, lock us up with rorschach.

1597
02:18:24,213 --> 02:18:25,297
Who cares?

1598
02:18:25,380 --> 02:18:27,216
World war III could start tomorrow.

1599
02:18:29,510 --> 02:18:30,552
Right?

1600
02:18:32,638 --> 02:18:33,806
Right.

1601
02:20:58,825 --> 02:21:00,202
Man: Come back here!

1602
02:21:03,413 --> 02:21:04,831
He's dead, rorschach.

1603
02:21:05,374 --> 02:21:06,792
While everyone's distracted,

1604
02:21:06,875 --> 02:21:09,503
we thought we'd bring you
a little housewarming gift.

1605
02:21:09,586 --> 02:21:11,797
Something from the machine shop.

1606
02:21:13,256 --> 02:21:15,050
Hey, boss, you notice?

1607
02:21:15,717 --> 02:21:17,928
None of that "small world,
tall order" crap.

1608
02:21:18,011 --> 02:21:21,765
'Cause he knows once we slice open
his lock, he's next on the block.

1609
02:21:22,307 --> 02:21:23,475
Fatchance.

1610
02:21:23,850 --> 02:21:25,018
You're dead, rorschach!

1611
02:21:25,602 --> 02:21:27,202
We got a prison full of killers
out here.

1612
02:21:27,270 --> 02:21:28,355
What do you got?

1613
02:21:31,608 --> 02:21:34,319
Your hands, my pleasure.

1614
02:21:35,904 --> 02:21:38,407
Lloyd: I can't reach the lock.
Should I cut the bars?

1615
02:21:38,490 --> 02:21:41,368
This riot won't last.
I been waiting 15 years for this.

1616
02:21:42,703 --> 02:21:45,539
I'm sorry, Lawrence, but you're
in the way of my revenge.

1617
02:21:50,043 --> 02:21:51,896
Nothing personal, big guy.

1618
02:21:53,296 --> 02:21:55,465
Boss! Wait!

1619
02:22:09,271 --> 02:22:11,023
Now you find out what the score is.

1620
02:22:11,565 --> 02:22:14,234
One-nothing. Come and get me.

1621
02:22:20,782 --> 02:22:21,992
Big figure: Come on.

1622
02:22:22,659 --> 02:22:23,952
Dan: So I've been thinking.

1623
02:22:25,078 --> 02:22:28,832
I feel that we have an obligation
to our fraternity.

1624
02:22:30,083 --> 02:22:32,961
- I think we ought to spring rorschach.
- Laurie: What?

1625
02:22:33,420 --> 02:22:34,629
Dan: Someone set him up.

1626
02:22:35,714 --> 02:22:39,217
And this whole cancer thing with Jon,
it just doesn't make sense.

1627
02:22:39,509 --> 02:22:40,802
You didn't get it.

1628
02:22:41,803 --> 02:22:44,514
Yeah, but breaking
into a maximum-security prison

1629
02:22:44,598 --> 02:22:46,398
is a little different
than putting out a fire.

1630
02:22:46,475 --> 02:22:47,893
Yeah, you're right.

1631
02:22:49,144 --> 02:22:50,771
It'll be more fun.

1632
02:22:55,108 --> 02:22:58,028
Hurry, Lloyd. Iwanna
smell this son of a bitch cooking.

1633
02:23:03,283 --> 02:23:04,367
Yes.

1634
02:23:23,678 --> 02:23:24,763
Hmm.

1635
02:23:24,846 --> 02:23:27,390
Never disposed of sewage
with a toilet before.

1636
02:23:28,016 --> 02:23:29,476
Obvious, really.

1637
02:23:30,477 --> 02:23:33,605
Two-nothing. Your move.

1638
02:23:37,109 --> 02:23:38,709
Big figure: Get out of the way! Move it!

1639
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:07,389
How do we know he's still alive?

1640
02:24:09,766 --> 02:24:10,976
Nite owl ii: He's alive.

1641
02:24:22,696 --> 02:24:24,030
No. No.

1642
02:24:24,948 --> 02:24:26,283
Where's my face?

1643
02:24:29,119 --> 02:24:30,495
Don't kill me.

1644
02:24:34,332 --> 02:24:35,709
Your turn, doctor.

1645
02:24:36,209 --> 02:24:38,837
Tell me, what do you see?

1646
02:26:05,215 --> 02:26:06,341
Don't move!

1647
02:26:15,350 --> 02:26:16,643
Rorschach.

1648
02:26:17,519 --> 02:26:20,188
Daniel. Miss Jupiter.

1649
02:26:20,397 --> 02:26:23,275
Excuse me. Have to visit men's room.

1650
02:26:24,359 --> 02:26:26,236
Oh, for Christ's sake.

1651
02:27:03,606 --> 02:27:05,442
Rorschach:
Good to see you in uniform, Daniel.

1652
02:27:05,525 --> 02:27:09,195
Should've known all you needed
was nice pair of legs to motivate you.

1653
02:27:09,738 --> 02:27:11,173
Silk spectre ii: You're such an asshole,
rorschach.

1654
02:27:11,197 --> 02:27:13,199
Spare me indignation.

1655
02:27:15,118 --> 02:27:17,620
Picked hell of a time
to be unfaithful to Jon.

1656
02:27:18,163 --> 02:27:20,915
Just get tired of being patriotic,
or someone put you up to it?

1657
02:27:20,999 --> 02:27:24,252
You know what, you don't know
what the fuck you're talking about!

1658
02:27:24,336 --> 02:27:26,838
Hey! Would you two stop?
You can argue later.

1659
02:27:27,922 --> 02:27:30,967
I had to turn the screechers off,
so we'll be drawing fire soon.

1660
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:38,058
Stop! Stop or we will shoot!

1661
02:28:17,263 --> 02:28:18,598
Dan: Hey, you all right?

1662
02:28:20,642 --> 02:28:24,354
Yeah. Just heavy, you know?

1663
02:28:25,313 --> 02:28:27,065
War, jailbreak.

1664
02:28:28,024 --> 02:28:32,237
Don't worry about it. Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.

1665
02:28:37,784 --> 02:28:39,911
- Hello, Laurie.
- Jon.

1666
02:28:40,829 --> 02:28:43,748
- TV said you were on Mars.
- I am on Mars.

1667
02:28:45,041 --> 02:28:47,419
You and I are about
to have a conversation there.

1668
02:28:47,877 --> 02:28:49,212
What are you talking about?

1669
02:28:49,295 --> 02:28:51,881
You're going to try to convince me
to save the world.

1670
02:28:57,971 --> 02:29:00,515
- Laurie, don't.
- Dan, trust me.

1671
02:29:01,266 --> 02:29:02,559
I have to go.

1672
02:29:08,523 --> 02:29:09,899
Beautiful, isn't it?

1673
02:29:15,155 --> 02:29:18,074
Forgive me. These things sometimes
slip my mind.

1674
02:29:19,701 --> 02:29:21,494
It won't happen again.

1675
02:29:23,037 --> 02:29:24,539
Laurie: That's comforting.

1676
02:29:27,792 --> 02:29:29,085
Oh, my god.

1677
02:29:29,836 --> 02:29:31,254
I'm on Mars.

1678
02:29:35,383 --> 02:29:39,220
Man: Hey. Nice ass.
Woman: Hey, asshole.

1679
02:29:39,304 --> 02:29:41,681
Man: Hey, let's see if that comic-book
retard's up here.

1680
02:29:43,057 --> 02:29:44,851
Hey, hey, hey. Yo.

1681
02:29:45,185 --> 02:29:49,564
You all hear? Some super-owl dude
just busted rorschach out of prison.

1682
02:29:50,023 --> 02:29:51,441
- Rorschach?
- Yeah.

1683
02:29:51,900 --> 02:29:53,860
That fool put my cousin
in a wheelchair.

1684
02:29:53,943 --> 02:29:54,986
You mean nite owl.

1685
02:29:55,069 --> 02:29:56,949
Him and rorschach used to be partners,
remember?

1686
02:29:57,030 --> 02:29:59,532
- Yeah.
- Maybe he messed your cousin up too.

1687
02:30:00,158 --> 02:30:02,160
- Didn't he write a book or something?
- Yeah.

1688
02:30:02,243 --> 02:30:05,413
You know, he lives over a garage
right near here.

1689
02:30:06,247 --> 02:30:07,749
- Yeah?
- Does he, now?

1690
02:30:11,669 --> 02:30:12,879
Sally: Hello?

1691
02:30:13,713 --> 02:30:14,964
Hollis: Sally?

1692
02:30:15,798 --> 02:30:18,092
- Hollis?
- Yeah.

1693
02:30:19,177 --> 02:30:22,055
Yes, Hollis Mason. Jesus.

1694
02:30:23,848 --> 02:30:25,433
All this time you've had my number

1695
02:30:25,517 --> 02:30:28,186
and you wait until
our sunset years to use it?

1696
02:30:28,603 --> 02:30:31,397
Hollis: Well, it seemed like
a special occasion, sal.

1697
02:30:31,773 --> 02:30:32,774
Sally: What?

1698
02:30:32,857 --> 02:30:37,237
The TV is reporting there was
a tenement fire last night.

1699
02:30:38,238 --> 02:30:40,990
There were trapped people
rescued by airship

1700
02:30:41,074 --> 02:30:46,204
and they say the pilot
was dressed like an owl.

1701
02:30:46,704 --> 02:30:49,082
And it seems he had
a sexy woman with him.

1702
02:30:49,165 --> 02:30:51,543
Laurie? My daughter, Laurie?

1703
02:30:53,253 --> 02:30:55,922
I can't get over Laurie
back in costume.

1704
02:30:56,548 --> 02:30:58,049
Maybe she'll finally thank me

1705
02:30:58,132 --> 02:30:59,884
for getting her started
in the first place.

1706
02:31:00,134 --> 02:31:03,054
You know, sal,
by the sound of your voice,

1707
02:31:04,055 --> 02:31:06,391
you're sounding younger than ever.

1708
02:31:06,808 --> 02:31:08,268
Why, bless you, Hollis.

1709
02:31:08,810 --> 02:31:10,979
But that's probably just senility.

1710
02:31:13,690 --> 02:31:16,317
Well, it's been great
talking to you, sal,

1711
02:31:16,776 --> 02:31:19,195
but someone's knocking.

1712
02:31:19,612 --> 02:31:23,741
Sally: Well, don't get too misty-eyed
thinking about old times.

1713
02:31:25,660 --> 02:31:27,287
You take care now, Hollis.

1714
02:31:27,495 --> 02:31:28,621
Ah, you too.

1715
02:31:29,080 --> 02:31:30,123
Bye.

1716
02:31:30,832 --> 02:31:31,958
Bye.

1717
02:31:35,712 --> 02:31:37,630
Man 1: We're looking for mr owl.

1718
02:31:38,965 --> 02:31:40,967
Yeah. Hold your horses.

1719
02:31:41,301 --> 02:31:42,760
Man 1: Mr owl, you there?

1720
02:31:43,344 --> 02:31:44,596
Man 2: Trick or treat.

1721
02:31:46,347 --> 02:31:48,016
Man 1: You should've
stayed retired, owl.

1722
02:32:53,289 --> 02:32:54,666
Rorschach: / hate this.

1723
02:32:54,999 --> 02:32:58,211
Cowering in cave,
hiding from authorities.

1724
02:32:59,462 --> 02:33:01,047
Cops are out there hunting us.

1725
02:33:01,464 --> 02:33:02,775
Unless you wanna go back to prison,

1726
02:33:02,799 --> 02:33:05,343
we'd be stupid to expose ourselves
without a plan.

1727
02:33:05,468 --> 02:33:06,886
And what would that be?

1728
02:33:07,929 --> 02:33:10,932
Once we've established a pattern,

1729
02:33:12,308 --> 02:33:14,435
we can break into pyramid,
see what we find.

1730
02:33:14,519 --> 02:33:16,479
Rorschach: Did that. Dead end.

1731
02:33:17,063 --> 02:33:19,565
I think it's a front company
for whoever's really behind it,

1732
02:33:19,649 --> 02:33:20,733
but can't prove it.

1733
02:33:24,612 --> 02:33:28,866
We need to hit up undennorld contacts,
squeeze people.

1734
02:33:29,242 --> 02:33:32,120
Sure, why don't we just pick names
out of a phone book?

1735
02:33:32,203 --> 02:33:34,163
You forgot how we do things, Daniel.

1736
02:33:34,497 --> 02:33:37,291
You've gone too soft. Too trusting.

1737
02:33:37,792 --> 02:33:38,960
Especially with women.

1738
02:33:39,043 --> 02:33:40,878
Okay, no.
Listen, I've had it with that.

1739
02:33:41,379 --> 02:33:43,423
God, who do... who do you
think you are, rorschach?

1740
02:33:43,506 --> 02:33:45,842
You live off people
while insulting them

1741
02:33:45,925 --> 02:33:48,761
and no one complains because
they think you're a goddamn lunatic.

1742
02:34:01,566 --> 02:34:02,942
I'm sorry.

1743
02:34:05,236 --> 02:34:07,989
I shouldn't have said that, man.

1744
02:34:10,241 --> 02:34:11,659
Daniel,

1745
02:34:13,035 --> 02:34:14,662
you are a good friend.

1746
02:34:18,458 --> 02:34:21,377
I know this can be difficult
with me sometimes.

1747
02:34:28,050 --> 02:34:29,385
Forget it.

1748
02:34:30,803 --> 02:34:32,096
It's okay, man.

1749
02:34:33,556 --> 02:34:35,308
Let's do it your way.

1750
02:34:54,368 --> 02:34:55,620
Oh, god.

1751
02:34:55,828 --> 02:34:59,248
Pyramid transnational.
Anyone heard of it?

1752
02:35:07,340 --> 02:35:09,342
Oh, you bastards.

1753
02:35:09,550 --> 02:35:12,553
I buy everyone a round
and you sell me out like this?

1754
02:35:13,554 --> 02:35:16,933
Back off, or I'll stick this glass
in your squidgy face.

1755
02:35:18,601 --> 02:35:21,229
Everybody stay calm.
We'll try to keep this brief.

1756
02:35:23,356 --> 02:35:25,775
Roy chess. On pyramid payroll.

1757
02:35:25,942 --> 02:35:28,903
Tried to kill Adrian veidt. Dead now.

1758
02:35:29,195 --> 02:35:30,530
Did you know him?

1759
02:35:30,988 --> 02:35:33,324
No.

1760
02:35:33,533 --> 02:35:34,826
Yeah, yeah!

1761
02:35:35,117 --> 02:35:37,161
I hired him.
I knew him from the inside.

1762
02:35:37,245 --> 02:35:38,246
You're a felon.

1763
02:35:38,329 --> 02:35:41,290
I was. I've been straight
ever since I got out, I swear.

1764
02:35:41,374 --> 02:35:42,792
I barely knew chess that well,

1765
02:35:42,875 --> 02:35:45,294
but I was told to hire
from the old life.

1766
02:35:45,378 --> 02:35:49,215
- Told by whom?
- My contact, miss slater.

1767
02:35:49,298 --> 02:35:51,884
Janey slater works for pyramid too?

1768
02:35:51,968 --> 02:35:53,761
Yeah, she was real nice.

1769
02:35:53,845 --> 02:35:56,055
She said hiring ex-cons
was part of the company program.

1770
02:35:56,138 --> 02:35:57,640
Give people a second chance.

1771
02:35:57,723 --> 02:35:59,725
God, please let go!
I'm telling the truth!

1772
02:36:03,813 --> 02:36:07,191
Janey slater,
Manhattan's old girlfriend.

1773
02:36:07,275 --> 02:36:09,986
Adrian's people might help us
find out who's undennriting pyramid.

1774
02:36:10,069 --> 02:36:11,153
Follow the money.

1775
02:36:11,237 --> 02:36:13,006
Woman:
Former member of the minutemen

1776
02:36:13,030 --> 02:36:14,657
Hollis Mason found murdered

1777
02:36:14,740 --> 02:36:17,076
in his apartment
less than an hour ago.

1778
02:36:17,159 --> 02:36:19,829
Witnesses reported
seeing members of a local gang

1779
02:36:19,912 --> 02:36:21,455
known as the knot-tops

1780
02:36:21,539 --> 02:36:24,625
leaving the area right around
the estimated time of death.

1781
02:36:24,917 --> 02:36:27,336
Reporting live, Tiffany burns...

1782
02:36:30,214 --> 02:36:31,215
Who did it?

1783
02:36:31,299 --> 02:36:33,217
I knew you were gonna
victimise me, man.

1784
02:36:33,301 --> 02:36:35,654
What about my civil rights, huh?
Just because I'm wearing...

1785
02:36:35,678 --> 02:36:38,347
- Tell me who did it!
- A lot of people dress like this.

1786
02:36:39,181 --> 02:36:41,893
Who murdered Hollis Mason?

1787
02:36:47,690 --> 02:36:49,984
You tell your friends they're dead.

1788
02:36:50,067 --> 02:36:53,571
I'm gonna take out
this entire rathole neighbourhood.

1789
02:36:53,779 --> 02:36:55,781
I'll break your neck!

1790
02:36:56,824 --> 02:36:59,452
Daniel, not in front of the civilians.

1791
02:37:00,369 --> 02:37:03,205
Oh, goddamn. Goddamn, Hollis.

1792
02:37:13,299 --> 02:37:15,593
Dr Manhattan: This is where
we hold our conversation.

1793
02:37:16,886 --> 02:37:18,095
In it, you reveal to me

1794
02:37:18,179 --> 02:37:20,389
that you and dreiberg
have been sleeping together.

1795
02:37:22,141 --> 02:37:25,019
- You know about me and Dan?
- Not yet.

1796
02:37:25,770 --> 02:37:28,064
But in a few moments
you're going to tell me.

1797
02:37:31,067 --> 02:37:33,235
If you already know the future,

1798
02:37:33,861 --> 02:37:36,113
then why were you surprised
when I left you?

1799
02:37:36,238 --> 02:37:38,157
Or when that reporter ambushed you?

1800
02:37:38,616 --> 02:37:41,494
Why even argue about it if you already
know how this is gonna end?

1801
02:37:43,329 --> 02:37:44,997
I have no choice.

1802
02:37:46,916 --> 02:37:49,251
Everything is preordained.

1803
02:37:50,044 --> 02:37:51,504
Even my responses.

1804
02:37:53,297 --> 02:37:56,217
And you're just
going through the motions.

1805
02:37:57,134 --> 02:37:59,345
The most powerful thing
in the universe

1806
02:37:59,428 --> 02:38:00,888
is still just a puppet.

1807
02:38:03,641 --> 02:38:05,685
We are all puppets, Laurie.

1808
02:38:07,269 --> 02:38:09,855
I'm just a puppet
who can see the strings.

1809
02:38:10,106 --> 02:38:11,691
And what if you're wrong?

1810
02:38:11,857 --> 02:38:16,278
Why does my perception of time
distress you so?

1811
02:38:16,487 --> 02:38:18,280
Because it's inhuman.

1812
02:38:18,531 --> 02:38:20,533
Because it makes me insane.

1813
02:38:21,158 --> 02:38:24,245
You always say you wanna comfort me.
Well, it isn't working.

1814
02:38:32,294 --> 02:38:34,338
Look, I don't wanna fight.

1815
02:38:36,382 --> 02:38:38,300
I'm sorry I slept with Dan.

1816
02:38:39,593 --> 02:38:40,970
You slept with Dan?

1817
02:38:43,472 --> 02:38:46,475
You just said that
you already knew about that.

1818
02:38:47,059 --> 02:38:50,563
I said often

1819
02:38:51,856 --> 02:38:55,568
that you were my only
remaining link to humanity.

1820
02:38:58,654 --> 02:39:00,156
Why would I save a world

1821
02:39:00,239 --> 02:39:02,408
I no longer have any stake in?

1822
02:39:04,493 --> 02:39:06,078
Then do it for me.

1823
02:39:07,496 --> 02:39:08,831
If you really care.

1824
02:39:09,123 --> 02:39:11,834
When you left me, I left earth.

1825
02:39:12,793 --> 02:39:15,212
Does that not show you that I care?

1826
02:39:18,799 --> 02:39:21,260
My red world here, now,

1827
02:39:22,720 --> 02:39:24,972
means more to me
than your blue one.

1828
02:39:26,223 --> 02:39:27,683
Let me show you.

1829
02:39:46,243 --> 02:39:48,662
Kissinger: Bombers are fuelled
and ready, sir.

1830
02:39:58,631 --> 02:40:00,257
It's time, gentlemen.

1831
02:40:02,843 --> 02:40:04,929
Take us to defcon one.

1832
02:40:12,520 --> 02:40:15,397
Rorschach: Not in penthouse.
Not in office.

1833
02:40:15,815 --> 02:40:18,901
What nocturnal proclivities
entice a man with everything

1834
02:40:18,984 --> 02:40:20,861
out into the night at this hour?

1835
02:40:22,696 --> 02:40:23,948
Daniel?

1836
02:40:25,866 --> 02:40:27,118
You with me?

1837
02:40:28,327 --> 02:40:30,746
- Yeah.
- Then what are you doing?

1838
02:40:33,541 --> 02:40:35,251
I'm gonna look for Adrian's itinerary.

1839
02:40:35,793 --> 02:40:37,670
Maybe he keeps on file.

1840
02:40:42,758 --> 02:40:45,136
- Something's not right.
- Agreed.

1841
02:40:45,511 --> 02:40:49,473
Janey slater, moloch, Roy chess
all work for pyramid.

1842
02:40:50,599 --> 02:40:54,770
Moloch said the comedian mentioned
list with his and slater's name on it.

1843
02:40:55,271 --> 02:40:58,440
Whoever owns pyramid
could be giving these people cancer.

1844
02:40:58,899 --> 02:41:00,401
Setting Manhattan up.

1845
02:41:14,498 --> 02:41:16,417
Hmm. Funny.

1846
02:41:16,917 --> 02:41:20,171
Ancient pharaohs looked foward
to the end of the world.

1847
02:41:20,379 --> 02:41:25,134
Believed cadavers would rise,
reclaim hearts from golden jars.

1848
02:41:25,634 --> 02:41:28,971
Hmm, must currently be holding breath
in anticipation.

1849
02:41:29,054 --> 02:41:30,055
Pharaohs?

1850
02:41:36,854 --> 02:41:38,898
Got a psych profile on Manhattan.

1851
02:41:39,523 --> 02:41:41,859
See what the corporate
head-peepers say.

1852
02:41:43,986 --> 02:41:47,907
"Subject continues
to retreat emotionally." Hmm.

1853
02:41:48,949 --> 02:41:52,036
"If the only remaining ties
were to be severed,

1854
02:41:52,536 --> 02:41:56,540
"we predict total detachment
from the human condition."

1855
02:42:00,044 --> 02:42:01,629
Nite owl ii: I'm in.

1856
02:42:34,787 --> 02:42:36,580
Man: Congratulations, mr veidt.

1857
02:42:36,914 --> 02:42:40,084
Dr Manhattan's energy reactor
is online.

1858
02:42:40,751 --> 02:42:44,213
Your support and your enthusiasm

1859
02:42:44,797 --> 02:42:46,840
is what has led to this triumph.

1860
02:42:47,258 --> 02:42:51,512
On behalf of the research team,
we salute you.

1861
02:42:51,762 --> 02:42:53,055
All: Cheers.

1862
02:42:54,640 --> 02:42:58,060
Ozymandias: What in life
does not deserve celebrating?

1863
02:42:59,770 --> 02:43:02,773
This is the new karnak.

1864
02:43:03,983 --> 02:43:07,778
This represents the culmination
of a dream more than 2000 years old,

1865
02:43:07,861 --> 02:43:09,697
a dream now assured

1866
02:43:10,322 --> 02:43:12,950
because of your unquestioning
assistance.

1867
02:43:16,203 --> 02:43:17,579
And for this,

1868
02:43:18,747 --> 02:43:20,582
I am ashamed,

1869
02:43:22,167 --> 02:43:25,713
ashamed that you must now share
such inadequate a reward.

1870
02:43:28,257 --> 02:43:29,842
To the pharaohs,

1871
02:43:31,093 --> 02:43:34,263
their greatest secrets
entrusted to their servants,

1872
02:43:34,680 --> 02:43:38,392
buried alive with them
in sand-floored chambers.

1873
02:43:39,893 --> 02:43:42,980
Sleep well, gentlemen.

1874
02:43:43,063 --> 02:43:45,899
Our new, peaceful world
will be indebted

1875
02:43:46,608 --> 02:43:48,652
to your great sacrifice.

1876
02:43:50,154 --> 02:43:51,572
Bubastis.

1877
02:43:56,660 --> 02:43:59,455
Rorschach: Rorschach's journal.
Final entry.

1878
02:44:00,122 --> 02:44:01,915
Veidt's behind everything.

1879
02:44:02,875 --> 02:44:04,168
Why?

1880
02:44:04,460 --> 02:44:06,003
What's his endgame?

1881
02:44:06,628 --> 02:44:09,465
I cannot imagine
a more dangerous opponent.

1882
02:44:10,382 --> 02:44:13,469
Used to joke he was fast enough
to catch a bullet.

1883
02:44:14,053 --> 02:44:16,430
He could kill us both
alone in the snow.

1884
02:44:17,056 --> 02:44:20,184
That's where we're going now:
Antarctica.

1885
02:44:20,976 --> 02:44:23,729
Whether I'm alive or dead
upon this reading,

1886
02:44:23,979 --> 02:44:25,773
I hope the world survives
long enough

1887
02:44:25,856 --> 02:44:27,566
for this journal to reach you.

1888
02:44:28,442 --> 02:44:30,819
I live my life free of compromise

1889
02:44:31,195 --> 02:44:34,198
and step into the shadow
without complaint or regret.

1890
02:44:35,657 --> 02:44:38,410
Rorschach, November 1st.

1891
02:44:44,500 --> 02:44:46,168
Oh, god help us.

1892
02:44:49,880 --> 02:44:52,424
- It's a little early for you, huh?
- Yeah.

1893
02:44:52,508 --> 02:44:54,802
I, er, wanted to finish the story
before school.

1894
02:45:00,182 --> 02:45:03,227
Listen, now you just keep it, okay?

1895
02:45:04,770 --> 02:45:06,772
- Huh?
- It's yours.

1896
02:45:07,606 --> 02:45:09,858
I mean, life's too short, right?

1897
02:45:10,776 --> 02:45:11,860
Yeah.

1898
02:45:13,862 --> 02:45:15,197
Thanks, man.

1899
02:45:40,889 --> 02:45:43,100
Why does death pass me by?

1900
02:45:46,353 --> 02:45:47,729
Davidstown?

1901
02:45:49,231 --> 02:45:50,524
Davidstown.

1902
02:45:51,275 --> 02:45:53,235
I was only miles away.

1903
02:45:53,861 --> 02:45:55,863
By now the town was overrun.

1904
02:45:56,196 --> 02:45:58,907
The fiends imagined themselves
safe from me.

1905
02:45:59,283 --> 02:46:00,742
But now I was home.

1906
02:46:00,826 --> 02:46:02,911
And revenge would be mine.

1907
02:46:10,919 --> 02:46:13,714
No, not the brigands
from the black freighter.

1908
02:46:13,839 --> 02:46:17,342
The man I recognised,
a moneylender from davidstown.

1909
02:46:17,426 --> 02:46:19,470
With davidstown certainly captured,

1910
02:46:19,553 --> 02:46:21,597
why would this scoundrel
and his wench

1911
02:46:21,680 --> 02:46:24,224
be allowed free passage
for this midnight tryst?

1912
02:46:24,349 --> 02:46:25,726
Had he collaborated?

1913
02:46:25,809 --> 02:46:27,561
Had he betrayed my people?

1914
02:46:27,644 --> 02:46:29,563
- My family?
- Woman: Come and get it, babe.

1915
02:46:30,898 --> 02:46:32,149
Here.

1916
02:46:41,283 --> 02:46:42,910
Mariner: My heart grew cold.

1917
02:46:43,452 --> 02:46:46,455
Was my wife comforted
before her execution

1918
02:46:46,747 --> 02:46:50,459
while this collaborator
and his pirate master sneered?

1919
02:46:51,210 --> 02:46:53,712
My decision was hurried,
but not difficult.

1920
02:46:53,795 --> 02:46:55,797
Man: Who are you? What?

1921
02:46:57,799 --> 02:47:01,470
Mariner: His head burst,
as if pressurised by the guilt within.

1922
02:47:10,854 --> 02:47:13,607
A buccaneer's whore deserves no pity.

1923
02:47:17,611 --> 02:47:19,488
Two figures had ridden here.

1924
02:47:19,863 --> 02:47:22,199
Two must ride back.

1925
02:47:27,120 --> 02:47:28,705
A pirate sentry.

1926
02:47:29,540 --> 02:47:32,960
I trotted unhurriedly
to avoid suspicion.

1927
02:47:34,586 --> 02:47:37,756
Their violation did not stop
with the good people of davidstown,

1928
02:47:37,839 --> 02:47:41,260
but had cut deeply,
infecting my beloved homeland.

1929
02:47:42,135 --> 02:47:45,013
My davidstown
was not as I last saw it.

1930
02:47:45,681 --> 02:47:48,934
Already it was afflicted
with the curse of the black freighter.

1931
02:47:49,768 --> 02:47:53,438
Soon, I would venture
amongst evil men,

1932
02:47:53,522 --> 02:47:56,024
butchers who now reside in my home

1933
02:47:56,108 --> 02:47:57,943
and make them fear me.

1934
02:48:00,737 --> 02:48:02,447
Upon my return home,

1935
02:48:02,531 --> 02:48:05,450
I found the streets
conspicuously silent.

1936
02:48:07,411 --> 02:48:10,247
I entered my former residence
noiselessly.

1937
02:48:10,956 --> 02:48:13,625
Careful not to rouse
the pirate butchers

1938
02:48:13,709 --> 02:48:16,461
occupying it
from their debauched slumber.

1939
02:48:22,551 --> 02:48:24,970
Unaware that death was amongst them,

1940
02:48:25,053 --> 02:48:29,266
they would know its dark embrace
without ever understanding why.

1941
02:48:29,349 --> 02:48:33,061
One, however, was awake. Frantic.

1942
02:48:33,562 --> 02:48:35,188
Lest he should raise alarms,

1943
02:48:35,272 --> 02:48:38,400
I set upon him as he entered
the night-wrapped chamber.

1944
02:48:39,610 --> 02:48:42,029
No pirates come, but something worse.

1945
02:48:42,112 --> 02:48:44,197
Father?

1946
02:48:44,281 --> 02:48:48,368
Mariner: / look up into faces familiar,
save for their terror.

1947
02:48:49,077 --> 02:48:52,623
Through puffed and bloodied lips,
she mouthed my name.

1948
02:48:52,706 --> 02:48:55,459
My love, why?

1949
02:49:00,547 --> 02:49:03,717
Mariner: There came an understanding
so large

1950
02:49:03,800 --> 02:49:05,427
it left no room for sanity.

1951
02:49:06,928 --> 02:49:08,138
So I ran.

1952
02:49:09,097 --> 02:49:10,474
Man 1: What's happened to her?

1953
02:49:11,767 --> 02:49:13,810
Man 2: You.

1954
02:49:14,770 --> 02:49:17,189
Mariner: The knowledge of my damnation
paced me,

1955
02:49:17,272 --> 02:49:19,816
shouting,
celebrating its awful victory.

1956
02:49:20,692 --> 02:49:22,361
My deduction was flawless.

1957
02:49:22,444 --> 02:49:24,571
The black freighter
was heading to davidstown.

1958
02:49:24,655 --> 02:49:26,865
- /t should have arrived.
- Man 3: He went that way!

1959
02:49:28,450 --> 02:49:31,870
Laurie: Can't you just tell me how this
all ends and save us the trouble?

1960
02:49:32,996 --> 02:49:34,956
Dr Manhattan:
It ends with you in tears.

1961
02:49:35,082 --> 02:49:36,291
Tears?

1962
02:49:36,875 --> 02:49:38,502
So you don't come back to earth?

1963
02:49:38,919 --> 02:49:41,421
At some point, yes.

1964
02:49:43,382 --> 02:49:45,384
The streets are filled with death.

1965
02:49:46,551 --> 02:49:48,053
Jon, please.

1966
02:49:48,637 --> 02:49:52,432
You have to stop this.
Everyone will die.

1967
02:49:53,433 --> 02:49:56,728
And the universe will not even notice.

1968
02:50:00,065 --> 02:50:03,694
In my opinion,
the existence of life

1969
02:50:05,153 --> 02:50:07,572
is a highly overrated phenomenon.

1970
02:50:10,242 --> 02:50:11,827
Just look around you.

1971
02:50:15,163 --> 02:50:19,126
Mars gets along perfectly well
without so much as a microorganism.

1972
02:50:20,210 --> 02:50:24,256
Here, it's a constantly changing
topographical map

1973
02:50:24,840 --> 02:50:28,343
flowing and shifting
around the pole in ripples

1974
02:50:28,427 --> 02:50:30,595
10,000 years wide.

1975
02:50:31,638 --> 02:50:32,889
So tell me,

1976
02:50:33,432 --> 02:50:37,561
how would all of this be
greatly improved by an oil pipeline?

1977
02:50:38,311 --> 02:50:39,896
By a shopping mall?

1978
02:50:44,568 --> 02:50:48,113
So it's too much to ask for a miracle?

1979
02:50:49,030 --> 02:50:51,199
Miracles, by their definition,
are meaningless.

1980
02:50:51,283 --> 02:50:52,993
Oh, god, Jon!

1981
02:50:53,076 --> 02:50:57,330
- Only what can happen does happen.
- Just stop your bullshit.

1982
02:50:59,082 --> 02:51:01,668
Land this thing. Now.

1983
02:51:01,752 --> 02:51:03,837
Dr Manhattan: As you wish.

1984
02:51:09,843 --> 02:51:10,927
Laurie: You know what?

1985
02:51:11,094 --> 02:51:13,805
You can send me back to earth
to fry with Dan and my mom

1986
02:51:13,889 --> 02:51:15,766
and all the other worthless humans.

1987
02:51:16,683 --> 02:51:18,185
But know that you were wrong.

1988
02:51:18,602 --> 02:51:22,063
You said this ended with me in tears
and, look, nothing.

1989
02:51:22,898 --> 02:51:24,775
Maybe you were wrong about everything.

1990
02:51:24,858 --> 02:51:29,070
You complain that I refuse
to see life on life's terms,

1991
02:51:30,614 --> 02:51:33,992
yet you continuously refuse
to see things from my perspective.

1992
02:51:34,743 --> 02:51:38,121
- You shut out what you're afraid of.
- I'm not afraid.

1993
02:51:39,206 --> 02:51:41,041
You want me to see things your way?

1994
02:51:41,124 --> 02:51:44,085
Go ahead, show me.
Do that thing you do.

1995
02:51:51,176 --> 02:51:54,387
Magic. Dreams.
That is what I had before.

1996
02:51:54,471 --> 02:51:56,556
I was a hero, goddamn it!

1997
02:51:56,640 --> 02:51:59,476
It's not my fault you got old.
What do you have to complain about?

1998
02:51:59,559 --> 02:52:01,812
I'm putting food on the table
for you and your child.

1999
02:52:01,895 --> 02:52:04,815
Why don't you call your friend Eddie?
Maybe he can give you a better life.

2000
02:52:05,440 --> 02:52:07,692
Sally: Even the grimy parts of it

2001
02:52:08,819 --> 02:52:10,612
keep on getting brighter.

2002
02:52:11,321 --> 02:52:14,616
You know, your mom, she was one
of the all-time champion beauties.

2003
02:52:15,283 --> 02:52:17,661
You got her eyes, you know.
You have that...

2004
02:52:17,744 --> 02:52:19,162
Take your hands off her.

2005
02:52:19,871 --> 02:52:21,665
The comedian: Hey, doll.
Long time no see.

2006
02:52:22,040 --> 02:52:24,709
Not long enough in my book, Eddie.
Get in the car.

2007
02:52:25,293 --> 02:52:26,461
Now.

2008
02:52:28,088 --> 02:52:30,090
Are there no depths you won't sink to?

2009
02:52:30,173 --> 02:52:33,009
Jesus Christ, Sally.
Can't a guy talk to his,

2010
02:52:34,719 --> 02:52:36,596
you know, old friend's daughter?

2011
02:52:38,807 --> 02:52:40,100
Drive.

2012
02:52:46,147 --> 02:52:49,067
Sally: It was a mistake. One time.

2013
02:52:49,234 --> 02:52:52,320
Guy tries to rape you, and years
later, you let him finish the job?

2014
02:52:52,404 --> 02:52:54,781
What? Were you drunk or just lonely?

2015
02:52:55,532 --> 02:52:57,492
Am I ever gonna live this down?

2016
02:53:01,746 --> 02:53:02,914
Laune.

2017
02:53:10,922 --> 02:53:12,632
No, not him.

2018
02:53:13,717 --> 02:53:15,051
The comedian

2019
02:53:16,344 --> 02:53:17,762
was your father.

2020
02:53:24,978 --> 02:53:29,441
No! No! No!

2021
02:54:03,099 --> 02:54:04,893
My life is just

2022
02:54:05,977 --> 02:54:07,854
one big joke.

2023
02:54:08,229 --> 02:54:10,106
I don't think your life is a joke.

2024
02:54:12,442 --> 02:54:13,693
Yeah, well,

2025
02:54:16,196 --> 02:54:20,033
I'm sorry if I don't
trust your sense of humour.

2026
02:54:28,625 --> 02:54:30,043
Will you smile

2027
02:54:32,087 --> 02:54:33,755
if I admit I was wrong?

2028
02:54:37,258 --> 02:54:38,593
About what?

2029
02:54:41,096 --> 02:54:42,472
Miracles.

2030
02:54:44,307 --> 02:54:47,268
Events with astronomical odds
of occurring

2031
02:54:48,311 --> 02:54:50,480
like oxygen turning into gold.

2032
02:54:51,106 --> 02:54:55,610
I've longed to witness such an event,
and yet I neglect

2033
02:54:56,569 --> 02:54:58,238
that in human coupling,

2034
02:54:59,823 --> 02:55:02,951
millions upon millions of cells
compete to create life

2035
02:55:04,077 --> 02:55:06,579
for generation after generation

2036
02:55:07,789 --> 02:55:09,833
until finally, your mother

2037
02:55:11,167 --> 02:55:12,419
loves a man,

2038
02:55:13,086 --> 02:55:16,798
Edward Blake, the comedian,
a man she has every reason to hate,

2039
02:55:16,881 --> 02:55:21,052
and out of that contradiction,
against unfathomable odds,

2040
02:55:21,511 --> 02:55:22,804
it's you.

2041
02:55:24,931 --> 02:55:26,182
Only

2042
02:55:27,142 --> 02:55:28,393
you,

2043
02:55:29,477 --> 02:55:30,729
that emerged.

2044
02:55:31,229 --> 02:55:35,025
To distil so specific a form

2045
02:55:36,026 --> 02:55:37,694
from all that chaos

2046
02:55:39,863 --> 02:55:42,198
is like turning air into gold.

2047
02:55:47,370 --> 02:55:48,788
A miracle.

2048
02:55:53,001 --> 02:55:54,419
And so,

2049
02:55:55,003 --> 02:55:56,588
I was wrong.

2050
02:55:58,798 --> 02:56:02,385
Now dry your eyes, and let's go home.

2051
02:56:30,205 --> 02:56:32,165
We got a bearing
on that artificial structure.

2052
02:56:32,499 --> 02:56:34,834
Heat signature's off the charts.

2053
02:56:35,210 --> 02:56:36,461
Veidt.

2054
02:56:36,544 --> 02:56:38,254
I don't like the way Archie's kicking.

2055
02:56:46,554 --> 02:56:47,806
The engines.

2056
02:56:47,889 --> 02:56:49,808
They're icing up. Hold onto something.

2057
02:56:50,391 --> 02:56:52,435
Daniel, you're coming in too low.

2058
02:56:55,146 --> 02:56:57,065
Don't wish to interfere with running
your ship,

2059
02:56:57,148 --> 02:56:58,459
but perhaps should pull up sharply...

2060
02:56:58,483 --> 02:57:01,653
I know! I'm trying.
I'm trying to pull him up, goddamn it!

2061
02:57:29,722 --> 02:57:31,992
Nite owl ii: I'm gonna redirect the heat
from the flamethrower

2062
02:57:32,016 --> 02:57:33,643
to speed up deicing,

2063
02:57:33,726 --> 02:57:36,563
but it's gonna take a while
and we don't have time to wait.

2064
02:57:37,897 --> 02:57:39,315
You need something warmer.

2065
02:57:39,983 --> 02:57:41,317
Fine like this.

2066
02:58:11,556 --> 02:58:12,765
What is it, girl?

2067
02:58:15,643 --> 02:58:16,853
Mmm.

2068
02:58:42,962 --> 02:58:44,547
Nite owl ii: Adrian's a pacifist.

2069
02:58:45,590 --> 02:58:47,759
He's a vegetarian, for Christ sakes.

2070
02:58:48,676 --> 02:58:50,386
He's never killed anyone in his life.

2071
02:58:50,470 --> 02:58:51,846
Rorschach: Hitler was vegetarian.

2072
02:58:51,930 --> 02:58:55,558
You're squeamish, leave him to me.
We won't get second chance.

2073
03:00:07,588 --> 03:00:08,798
Gentlemen.

2074
03:00:09,465 --> 03:00:13,386
- Welcome.
- Adrian, we know everything.

2075
03:00:13,594 --> 03:00:15,305
Then what's there to discuss, Dan?

2076
03:00:15,722 --> 03:00:18,725
Plenty. You killed comedian.

2077
03:00:18,808 --> 03:00:20,476
May he rest in peace.

2078
03:00:20,893 --> 03:00:22,770
Blake figured it out first.

2079
03:00:23,438 --> 03:00:25,648
Nixon had him keeping tabs on us,

2080
03:00:25,732 --> 03:00:27,942
making sure we weren't
rocking the boat.

2081
03:00:28,526 --> 03:00:30,778
Blake found out what I was doing
here in karnak,

2082
03:00:30,862 --> 03:00:32,780
and by the time
he visited poor moloch,

2083
03:00:32,864 --> 03:00:34,741
he was cracking badly.

2084
03:00:35,241 --> 03:00:37,869
Even I couldn't predict he'd be
the one to have a change of heart.

2085
03:00:37,952 --> 03:00:40,455
So...

2086
03:00:41,706 --> 03:00:43,082
I had to kill him.

2087
03:00:44,292 --> 03:00:47,712
Then I neutralised Jon. No easy task.

2088
03:00:48,171 --> 03:00:50,840
I put roughly $2 billion
into tachyon research

2089
03:00:50,923 --> 03:00:52,925
to block Jon's vision
of the future.

2090
03:00:53,009 --> 03:00:55,636
Rorschach: You used his psych profile
to manipulate him.

2091
03:00:55,928 --> 03:00:57,221
Got him to leave the planet.

2092
03:00:57,305 --> 03:01:00,141
I've known Jon long enough
to see he isn't devoid of emotion.

2093
03:01:01,184 --> 03:01:04,896
His subtle facial twitches wouldn't be
noticed by the layman, but to me,

2094
03:01:05,313 --> 03:01:06,939
he might as well have been sobbing.

2095
03:01:07,357 --> 03:01:10,068
All I needed to do
was tug on the thread.

2096
03:01:10,401 --> 03:01:12,737
The sudden flood of emotion
Jon felt

2097
03:01:12,820 --> 03:01:15,698
when he came to believe he'd given
cancer to the people he loved

2098
03:01:16,407 --> 03:01:18,910
was all the excuse he needed
to leave earth.

2099
03:01:18,993 --> 03:01:22,705
Nite owl ii: Your bullshit assassin.
You paid him to throw us off.

2100
03:01:22,789 --> 03:01:27,293
Ozymandias: Mr chess gave his life
in the service of a higher cause, Dan.

2101
03:01:29,712 --> 03:01:32,090
Iput a cyanide capsule
in his mouth,

2102
03:01:32,924 --> 03:01:35,343
leaving only one loose end.

2103
03:01:36,469 --> 03:01:39,514
You, and your mask-killer theory,

2104
03:01:39,931 --> 03:01:43,101
one you followed
with the tenacity of a true sociopath.

2105
03:01:43,184 --> 03:01:44,644
I tipped off the police,

2106
03:01:44,811 --> 03:01:47,313
and once you were in prison,
I was able to move fonnard.

2107
03:01:47,563 --> 03:01:49,440
Rorschach: Sorry to disappoint you.

2108
03:02:03,162 --> 03:02:05,790
Nite owl ii: We were supposed to
make the world a better place.

2109
03:02:05,873 --> 03:02:07,753
Ozymandias: Dan, that's exactly
what I am doing.

2110
03:02:07,792 --> 03:02:09,043
Nite owl ii: Nuclear war?

2111
03:02:09,127 --> 03:02:10,420
Human extinction?

2112
03:02:20,930 --> 03:02:25,393
Of course, my moral safeguards gave me
pause at the necessary sacrifice.

2113
03:02:26,102 --> 03:02:28,729
A few key regions around the globe,

2114
03:02:29,313 --> 03:02:34,110
New York, Los Angeles, Moscow,
Hong Kong,

2115
03:02:34,944 --> 03:02:36,571
disintegrated in an instant.

2116
03:02:37,530 --> 03:02:40,408
Fifteen million people killed

2117
03:02:40,741 --> 03:02:42,827
by dr Manhattan himself.

2118
03:02:44,078 --> 03:02:46,831
The world's punishment
for flirting with world war III.

2119
03:02:46,914 --> 03:02:48,082
Jon wouldn't do that.

2120
03:02:48,708 --> 03:02:51,461
A fact no one outside this room
ever has to know.

2121
03:02:52,128 --> 03:02:55,173
The energy breakthrough I was
working on just came to fruition.

2122
03:02:56,466 --> 03:03:00,136
All these years, Jon was helping me
replicate his power,

2123
03:03:00,428 --> 03:03:02,555
unaware of how I planned to use it.

2124
03:03:03,473 --> 03:03:04,557
You see,

2125
03:03:06,350 --> 03:03:07,977
the comedian was right.

2126
03:03:09,604 --> 03:03:10,855
Humanity's savage nature

2127
03:03:10,938 --> 03:03:13,691
will inevitably lead
to global annihilation.

2128
03:03:14,609 --> 03:03:16,360
So in order to save this planet,

2129
03:03:17,403 --> 03:03:18,905
I had to trick it

2130
03:03:19,989 --> 03:03:23,951
with the greatest practical joke
in human history.

2131
03:03:24,285 --> 03:03:27,622
- Killing millions.
- To save billions.

2132
03:03:27,830 --> 03:03:29,790
A necessary crime.

2133
03:03:30,500 --> 03:03:32,543
Rorschach: You know
we can't let you do that.

2134
03:03:33,961 --> 03:03:35,505
"Do that," rorschach?

2135
03:03:36,339 --> 03:03:37,924
I'm not a comic-book villain.

2136
03:03:38,799 --> 03:03:41,260
Do you seriously think
I'd explain my masterstroke to you

2137
03:03:41,344 --> 03:03:43,064
if there were even
the slightest possibility

2138
03:03:43,095 --> 03:03:44,388
you could affect the outcome?

2139
03:03:48,184 --> 03:03:50,561
I triggered it 35 minutes ago.

2140
03:04:14,961 --> 03:04:18,589
Mariner: Eventually, / came
to a dismal black ocean

2141
03:04:18,673 --> 03:04:20,508
stretching endlessly before me.

2142
03:04:21,217 --> 03:04:24,637
How had I reached
this appalling position with love,

2143
03:04:24,720 --> 03:04:27,056
only love, as my guide?

2144
03:04:29,433 --> 03:04:31,477
The moneylender floated at my feet.

2145
03:04:32,645 --> 03:04:35,231
Noble intentions
had led me to atrocity.

2146
03:04:35,523 --> 03:04:39,193
The righteous anger
fuelling my ingenious, awful scheme

2147
03:04:39,277 --> 03:04:41,320
was but delusion.

2148
03:04:42,154 --> 03:04:43,489
Where was my error?

2149
03:04:44,156 --> 03:04:48,786
Planning to resume my flight,
I raised my head and saw her.

2150
03:04:51,622 --> 03:04:55,585
The vessel seemed to be waiting,
not hovering to strike.

2151
03:04:56,252 --> 03:04:58,129
And, gradually, lunderstood

2152
03:04:58,212 --> 03:05:00,464
what innocent intent
had brought me to

2153
03:05:01,424 --> 03:05:03,676
and waded out beyond my depth.

2154
03:05:05,219 --> 03:05:08,431
The unspeakable truth
loomed unavoidably before me

2155
03:05:08,514 --> 03:05:10,975
as I swam
towards the anchored freighter.

2156
03:05:11,434 --> 03:05:15,187
Its dark and lurching mast
filled all my vision.

2157
03:05:15,855 --> 03:05:18,691
All my well-meaning plans
had come to this.

2158
03:05:19,066 --> 03:05:22,278
The world I tried to save
was lost beyond recall.

2159
03:05:23,779 --> 03:05:25,573
A rope snaked down.

2160
03:05:25,823 --> 03:05:27,617
Sputtering, I grabbed it.

2161
03:05:28,284 --> 03:05:30,828
And from the decks above,
a cheer went up

2162
03:05:30,911 --> 03:05:35,750
both gross and black,
its stench affronting heaven.

2163
03:05:38,127 --> 03:05:40,796
There had been no plan
to capture davidstown.

2164
03:05:41,297 --> 03:05:43,424
They'd come to wait
until they could collect

2165
03:05:43,507 --> 03:05:45,301
the only prize they valued.

2166
03:05:46,510 --> 03:05:49,096
Claim the only soul they truly wanted.

2167
03:05:55,686 --> 03:05:57,271
Mariner: I was a horror.

2168
03:05:58,648 --> 03:06:01,317
Amongst horrors must I dwell.

2169
03:06:11,577 --> 03:06:15,206
- Man, this shit don't make no sense.
- You're telling me.

2170
03:06:16,957 --> 03:06:20,211
Sorry, but you can keep this garbage.
Wasting all my damn time.

2171
03:06:20,294 --> 03:06:23,506
Hey, hey. You know, all this time
you've been coming here

2172
03:06:23,881 --> 03:06:25,299
I never caught your name.

2173
03:06:27,009 --> 03:06:30,012
- Bernard.
- Bernard? You're kidding.

2174
03:06:30,096 --> 03:06:33,516
That's... That's my name too.

2175
03:06:34,684 --> 03:06:38,145
Not big a deal.
There's lots of people called Bernard.

2176
03:08:03,439 --> 03:08:05,900
Jesus Christ, Henry.

2177
03:08:06,567 --> 03:08:08,694
Why the hell
didn't we get a launch detection?

2178
03:08:10,446 --> 03:08:14,158
It's not the Soviets, sir.

2179
03:08:15,576 --> 03:08:18,913
Intel indicates
the energy signature

2180
03:08:18,996 --> 03:08:20,831
was generated by

2181
03:08:22,458 --> 03:08:24,084
dr Manhattan.

2182
03:08:26,504 --> 03:08:28,714
Jon.

2183
03:08:32,218 --> 03:08:33,385
Interference.

2184
03:08:33,886 --> 03:08:35,763
Cataclysmic interference.

2185
03:08:45,439 --> 03:08:47,399
Laurie: I can't believe it happened.

2186
03:08:49,276 --> 03:08:51,987
This wasn't caused
by nuclear warheads.

2187
03:08:56,742 --> 03:08:58,118
It was me.

2188
03:09:02,414 --> 03:09:03,457
Did this.

2189
03:09:03,999 --> 03:09:07,169
- What do you mean, you did this?
- Not directly.

2190
03:09:08,379 --> 03:09:10,256
It was made to look like I did it.

2191
03:09:14,260 --> 03:09:15,553
Adrian.

2192
03:09:21,892 --> 03:09:23,352
Speak of the devil.

2193
03:09:27,106 --> 03:09:28,208
Nite owl ii: Jon...
Dr Manhattan: I know.

2194
03:09:28,232 --> 03:09:30,442
Rorschach: Must stop him.
Killed Blake, killed millions.

2195
03:09:30,526 --> 03:09:31,694
Wait here.

2196
03:09:43,038 --> 03:09:44,832
Adrian, stop this.

2197
03:09:46,917 --> 03:09:48,794
The tachyons were clever...

2198
03:09:49,837 --> 03:09:51,630
But even if I can't predict
where you are,

2199
03:09:51,714 --> 03:09:53,340
I can turn the walls to glass.

2200
03:09:55,551 --> 03:09:57,344
I should thank you.

2201
03:09:59,263 --> 03:10:02,099
I'd almost forgotten the excitement
of not knowing

2202
03:10:03,475 --> 03:10:05,895
the delights of uncertainty.

2203
03:10:10,524 --> 03:10:12,109
Forgive me, girl.

2204
03:10:35,257 --> 03:10:36,884
You're such an asshole.

2205
03:11:11,001 --> 03:11:12,795
Nite owl ii: Veidt, you bastard.

2206
03:11:12,878 --> 03:11:14,755
- If you've hurt her, I'll...
- Dan...

2207
03:11:17,174 --> 03:11:21,220
Grow up. My new world
demands less obvious heroism.

2208
03:11:22,388 --> 03:11:26,517
Your schoolboy heroics are redundant.

2209
03:11:27,059 --> 03:11:28,560
What have they achieved?

2210
03:11:30,688 --> 03:11:32,898
Failing to prevent
earth's salvation

2211
03:11:34,358 --> 03:11:36,193
is your only triumph.

2212
03:11:37,152 --> 03:11:39,238
Dr Manhattan:
I'm disappointed in you, Adrian.

2213
03:11:39,863 --> 03:11:42,199
I'm very disappointed.

2214
03:11:55,671 --> 03:11:58,882
Reassembling myself
was the first trick I learned.

2215
03:11:59,591 --> 03:12:01,176
It didn't kill osterman.

2216
03:12:04,430 --> 03:12:06,890
Did you really think it would kill me?

2217
03:12:08,267 --> 03:12:10,894
I have walked across the surface
of the sun.

2218
03:12:11,895 --> 03:12:15,441
I have witnessed events
so tiny and so fast,

2219
03:12:15,774 --> 03:12:18,152
they can hardly be said
to have occurred at all.

2220
03:12:18,610 --> 03:12:21,780
But you, Adrian, you're just a man.

2221
03:12:23,157 --> 03:12:25,868
The world's smartest man

2222
03:12:25,951 --> 03:12:28,287
poses no more threat to me

2223
03:12:28,704 --> 03:12:31,081
than does its smartest termite.

2224
03:12:34,001 --> 03:12:35,252
What's that?

2225
03:12:35,919 --> 03:12:37,629
Another ultimate weapon?

2226
03:12:38,338 --> 03:12:39,548
Yes.

2227
03:12:41,800 --> 03:12:43,218
You could say that.

2228
03:12:46,930 --> 03:12:48,265
Came under attack.

2229
03:12:49,600 --> 03:12:52,770
Millions of lives
were suddenly ended

2230
03:12:53,437 --> 03:12:57,733
in an act of evil
perpetrated by dr Manhattan himself.

2231
03:13:00,402 --> 03:13:04,406
Since the attacks,
I have been in constant contact

2232
03:13:04,490 --> 03:13:06,617
with the premier of the ussr.

2233
03:13:07,701 --> 03:13:10,120
Putting aside our past differences,

2234
03:13:10,871 --> 03:13:12,956
we have both pledged to unite

2235
03:13:13,540 --> 03:13:15,959
against this common enemy.

2236
03:13:17,377 --> 03:13:19,088
With the rest of the world,

2237
03:13:19,630 --> 03:13:21,131
we will prevail.

2238
03:13:24,301 --> 03:13:26,553
This is a day we shall never forget.

2239
03:13:27,471 --> 03:13:31,308
And yet we go fon/vard
to defend the human race

2240
03:13:31,934 --> 03:13:35,896
and all that is good
and just in our world.

2241
03:13:37,898 --> 03:13:42,194
Thank you. God bless us all.

2242
03:13:42,444 --> 03:13:43,779
Ozymandias: Do you see?

2243
03:13:46,323 --> 03:13:48,659
Two superpowers retreating from war.

2244
03:13:50,702 --> 03:13:52,454
I've saved the earth from hell.

2245
03:13:52,996 --> 03:13:54,206
We both have.

2246
03:13:55,249 --> 03:13:57,501
This is as much your victory
as it is mine.

2247
03:14:02,506 --> 03:14:03,882
Ozymandias: Now we can return,

2248
03:14:05,384 --> 03:14:06,802
do what we were meant to.

2249
03:14:07,261 --> 03:14:09,179
We were meant to exactjustice.

2250
03:14:10,556 --> 03:14:12,641
Everyone's gonna know
what you've done.

2251
03:14:12,724 --> 03:14:13,725
Will they?

2252
03:14:14,184 --> 03:14:18,939
By exposing me, you would sacrifice
the peace so many died for today.

2253
03:14:19,022 --> 03:14:21,650
- Peace based on a lie.
- Butpeace

2254
03:14:22,693 --> 03:14:24,695
- nonetheless.
- He's right.

2255
03:14:25,612 --> 03:14:27,573
Exposing Adrian
would only doom the world

2256
03:14:27,656 --> 03:14:29,449
to nuclear destruction again.

2257
03:14:29,533 --> 03:14:32,286
No. We can't do this.

2258
03:14:32,369 --> 03:14:33,787
On Mars,

2259
03:14:35,956 --> 03:14:37,791
you taught me the value of life.

2260
03:14:38,625 --> 03:14:40,711
If we hope to preserve it here,

2261
03:14:41,795 --> 03:14:43,463
we must remain silent.

2262
03:14:47,593 --> 03:14:49,511
Keep your own secrets.

2263
03:14:56,518 --> 03:14:57,644
Don't even think about it.

2264
03:15:00,355 --> 03:15:01,690
Rorschach.

2265
03:15:03,650 --> 03:15:04,943
Wait.

2266
03:15:06,320 --> 03:15:07,946
Rorschach: Never compromise.

2267
03:15:08,822 --> 03:15:11,074
Not even in the face of armageddon.

2268
03:15:12,159 --> 03:15:14,912
That's always been the difference
between us, Daniel.

2269
03:15:25,964 --> 03:15:29,092
I've made myself feel every death,

2270
03:15:31,345 --> 03:15:36,391
see every innocent face
I've murdered to save humanity.

2271
03:15:42,564 --> 03:15:46,193
- You understand, don't you?
- Dr Manhattan: Without condoning

2272
03:15:48,028 --> 03:15:49,488
or condemning

2273
03:15:54,326 --> 03:15:55,786
I understand.

2274
03:16:03,627 --> 03:16:06,797
Out of my way. People have to be told.

2275
03:16:07,547 --> 03:16:09,549
You know I can't let you do that.

2276
03:16:10,926 --> 03:16:13,262
Suddenly you discover humanity?

2277
03:16:15,264 --> 03:16:16,682
Convenient.

2278
03:16:25,649 --> 03:16:30,112
If you'd cared from the start,
none of this would have happened.

2279
03:16:34,199 --> 03:16:36,451
I can change almost anything,

2280
03:16:41,665 --> 03:16:43,709
But I can't change human nature.

2281
03:16:45,377 --> 03:16:48,005
Of course
you must protect veidt's new utopia.

2282
03:16:50,340 --> 03:16:52,592
What's one more body
amongst foundations?

2283
03:16:59,599 --> 03:17:01,435
Well, what are you waiting for?

2284
03:17:04,896 --> 03:17:06,273
Do it.

2285
03:17:12,863 --> 03:17:14,323
Do it!

2286
03:17:37,429 --> 03:17:42,351
Dr Manhattan: I'm leaving this galaxy
for one a little less complicated.

2287
03:17:43,310 --> 03:17:45,687
Laurie: / thought you said
you cared about life again.

2288
03:17:46,021 --> 03:17:47,356
Dr Manhattan: / do.

2289
03:17:48,690 --> 03:17:50,692
I think maybe I'll create some.

2290
03:17:55,864 --> 03:17:57,282
Goodbye, Laurie.

2291
03:18:33,318 --> 03:18:34,528
Come on.

2292
03:18:36,947 --> 03:18:38,240
Come on!

2293
03:18:42,869 --> 03:18:46,706
Dan, a world united and at peace.

2294
03:18:48,375 --> 03:18:49,793
There had to be sacrifice.

2295
03:18:49,876 --> 03:18:54,214
No! You haven't idealised mankind,
but you've deformed it.

2296
03:18:54,506 --> 03:18:55,882
You've mutilated it.

2297
03:18:56,508 --> 03:18:57,801
That's your legacy.

2298
03:19:07,144 --> 03:19:09,062
That's the real practical joke.

2299
03:20:02,407 --> 03:20:06,411
Man: We repeat, there is nothing
wrong with your television set.

2300
03:20:06,703 --> 03:20:09,956
You are about to participate
in a great adventure.

2301
03:20:10,373 --> 03:20:13,585
You are about to experience
the awe and mystery

2302
03:20:13,668 --> 03:20:18,507
which reaches from the inner mind
to the outer limits.

2303
03:20:20,675 --> 03:20:22,875
Sally: Sure you don't want a drink?

2304
03:20:23,970 --> 03:20:25,013
I'm okay.

2305
03:20:26,097 --> 03:20:27,182
Cheers.

2306
03:20:28,642 --> 03:20:31,144
Look, there's something I need
to get off my chest.

2307
03:20:33,021 --> 03:20:35,273
I know that Eddie Blake was my father.

2308
03:20:36,399 --> 03:20:37,484
Oh.

2309
03:20:38,568 --> 03:20:40,195
Laurel.

2310
03:20:41,321 --> 03:20:43,156
What you must think of me.

2311
03:20:44,533 --> 03:20:46,409
I'm sorry I never told you.

2312
03:20:47,244 --> 03:20:48,537
I should have,

2313
03:20:49,162 --> 03:20:53,083
but I don't know,
I just felt ashamed. I felt stupid.

2314
03:20:53,416 --> 03:20:54,960
It doesn't matter.

2315
03:20:56,253 --> 03:20:58,338
People's lives take them
strange places.

2316
03:20:58,421 --> 03:21:00,840
They do strange things

2317
03:21:02,050 --> 03:21:04,344
and, well,
sometimes they can't talk about them.

2318
03:21:05,178 --> 03:21:06,680
I know how that is,

2319
03:21:08,139 --> 03:21:10,433
but I just want you to know

2320
03:21:11,393 --> 03:21:13,728
that you never did
anything wrong by me.

2321
03:21:18,233 --> 03:21:21,736
You asked me why I wasn't mad at him.

2322
03:21:24,489 --> 03:21:26,241
Because he gave me you.

2323
03:21:31,705 --> 03:21:32,831
Thanks, mom.

2324
03:21:35,667 --> 03:21:37,085
I love you.

2325
03:21:44,884 --> 03:21:48,138
- Hello, miss Jupiter.
- Oh, Sally, please.

2326
03:21:50,890 --> 03:21:55,520
Excuse me. Gotta go freshen up.
I'll be right back.

2327
03:22:05,780 --> 03:22:08,366
- So how's it going up here?
- Good.

2328
03:22:08,533 --> 03:22:10,076
How's it going down there?

2329
03:22:10,368 --> 03:22:13,288
Good. I think
I've got everything working.

2330
03:22:13,913 --> 03:22:18,710
All of Archie's systems are upgraded.
Finished the tinkering for now,

2331
03:22:18,793 --> 03:22:20,545
so all we gotta do is take her out.

2332
03:22:21,254 --> 03:22:23,882
Well, that sounds like a date.

2333
03:22:35,393 --> 03:22:37,145
Are we gonna be all right?

2334
03:22:39,731 --> 03:22:43,610
Long as people think Jon's still
watching us, we'll be all right

2335
03:22:44,444 --> 03:22:45,862
in the end.

2336
03:22:47,906 --> 03:22:49,699
I know what Jon would say,

2337
03:22:50,200 --> 03:22:51,576
"nothing ends."

2338
03:22:53,620 --> 03:22:55,830
Nothing ever ends.

2339
03:23:44,045 --> 03:23:47,757
Seymour, we got nothing
to write about any more.

2340
03:23:48,299 --> 03:23:49,759
Everyone in the country,

2341
03:23:49,843 --> 03:23:51,763
every country in the world
are holding hands now,

2342
03:23:51,803 --> 03:23:54,389
singing songs
about peace and love.

2343
03:23:55,932 --> 03:23:58,643
It's like living in a goddamn
global hippie commune.

2344
03:23:59,102 --> 03:24:03,106
Well, erm, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna
be running for president in '88.

2345
03:24:03,189 --> 03:24:04,733
We could run a piece on that.

2346
03:24:05,191 --> 03:24:08,319
Seymour, we don't dignify absurdities
with coverage.

2347
03:24:08,445 --> 03:24:10,155
This is still america, damn it.

2348
03:24:10,238 --> 03:24:12,115
Who wants a cowboy in the white house?

2349
03:24:12,824 --> 03:24:17,120
Okay. Erm... I could look for something
in the crank file.

2350
03:24:17,328 --> 03:24:18,455
Crank file.

2351
03:24:18,997 --> 03:24:20,999
Whatever. Take some initiative.

2352
03:24:21,207 --> 03:24:23,752
Run whatever you like.
I leave it entirely in your hands.

2353
03:24:30,258 --> 03:24:34,721
Rorschach: Rorschach's journal,
October 12th, 1985.

2354
03:24:35,263 --> 03:24:38,850
Tonight, a comedian died in New York.
