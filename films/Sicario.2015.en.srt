00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,133
Get down! Get down!

2
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,301
Don't move!

3
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,677
FBI! Don't move!

4
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,555
Get down! Get down!

5
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,266
Where are the hostages?
Where are the hostages?

6
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,894
- FBI, Police! Don't move!
- Down! Stay down!

7
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,563
Cross your legs! Cross your legs
and put your hands in the air!

8
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:31,109
Police! Don't move! Police! Don't move!
Get down! Get down!

9
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,862
- Clear!
- Police! Search warrant. Don't move!

10
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,907
- Steppin' out!
- Police, don't move!

11
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,035
Police, don't move! Search warrant!

12
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,246
FBI!

13
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,296
Are you hit?

14
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,422
I'm good.

15
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,007
Fuck!

16
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,425
Front, you're clear!

17
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,427
Team leader! Status?

18
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,096
- Front clear!
- We're clear, ma'am!

19
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,847
Two suspects in custody!

20
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,605
- You okay, Macer?
- Yeah.

21
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,025
Why'd he shoot? There's no one here.

22
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,945
Whoa...

23
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,575
What the fuck?

24
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,368
Jesus!

25
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,087
Those weren't our hostages.

26
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,507
No. That was somethin' else.

27
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,551
- Macer?
- Yeah?

28
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,928
U.S. Attorney wants a statement.
What do you want me to say to her?

29
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,096
The truth.

30
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,150
Looks like Sonora.

31
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,402
Yeah.

32
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:22,781
How many, total?

33
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,993
We've got 15 in this hall here,
about 20 in the back bedroom.

34
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,038
We haven't even checked the attic
or under the crawl space.

35
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,249
Call DOJ, let 'em know what we have.

36
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,921
This one of the houses
owned by Manuel Diaz?

37
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,632
No way to connect him, but he owns it.

38
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,594
Jesus Christ.

39
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,848
Reg, step out. It's okay.

40
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,041
Vickers! I need bolt cutters!

41
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,261
Vickers!

42
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,513
PD found something.

43
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:58,513
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

44
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,540
Relax.

45
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:45,674
Relax.

46
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,845
<i>Such a heavy body count
this close to Phoenix,</i>

47
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,557
<i>is without a doubt a major escalation
for the cartels.</i>

48
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:58,645
<i>There will be pressure in Washington
to explain how such a dramatic outrage</i>

49
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,982
<i>could happen so deep inside
the American heartland.</i>

50
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,609
<i>We may be talking about the victims
of a turf war,</i>

51
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,570
<i>or maybe some illegal immigrants
who are tied to a ransom,</i>

52
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,908
<i>but it will be some weeks before we have
a clearer picture on who the victims...</i>

53
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,042
What's goin' on?

54
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,711
I have no idea.

55
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,464
She's been leading
our kidnap response team for three years.

56
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:30,135
Put her through the grinder since
she got here, and she hasn't blinked.

57
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,761
She's in the front line.

58
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,681
Nobody's gonna be happier than Kate
to see these guys go down.

59
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,558
So, she's a thumper.

60
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,893
Today was her fifth O.I.S.

61
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:42,188
5-and-0, not bad for a rookie.
She never worked cases?

62
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,357
Been kicking doors since day one.

63
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,527
I like her already. What about the partner?
He seen any action?

64
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,404
He's only been with us 18 months.

65
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,864
What's his background?

66
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:55,035
He's a sharp kid.
ROTC scholarship to Maryland,

67
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,163
did a tour in Iraq,
got his law degree from UNC.

68
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,124
He's green, but he's good.

69
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,878
No lawyers on this train.
Just give me the girl.

70
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,297
We did this by the book, right?

71
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,798
Come on, of course.

72
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,059
- Jesus.
- What?

73
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,436
Oh, shit.

74
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:22,771
Would you step in here, Kate?

75
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,621
Quite a find today,
the loss of two officers notwithstanding.

76
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,082
Yes, sir.

77
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,502
How familiar are you
with Manuel Diaz's operation?

78
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,631
His company, Sun Oasis,
has 80 or so foreclosure properties.

79
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,092
He has other legitimate businesses.

80
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,637
But he's rumored to be linked
with one of the Mexican cartels.

81
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,973
Manuel Diaz works for the Sonora Cartel.

82
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,559
He's most likely their senior member
in the United States.

83
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,686
What do you know about his brother?

84
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,731
I wasn't aware he had one.

85
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,859
Guillermo. His brother's name is Guillermo.

86
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,277
Do you know anything about his cousin?

87
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,655
I didn't know he had one of those either.
None of that is in his file.

88
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,615
His cousin is Fausto Alarcon.

89
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,201
I don't know who that is.

90
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,078
No one does. He's off the grid.

91
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,080
He's number three in the Sonora Cartel.

92
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,499
This is not my department, sir.

93
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:27,168
Like I said,
Agent Macer doesn't work narcotics.

94
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,420
She runs a kidnap response team.

95
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,880
Are you married?

96
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,383
Am I married?

97
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,343
Do you have a husband?

98
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:38,930
Divorced.

99
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,308
Kids?

100
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,686
No.

101
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:46,855
Anything else?

102
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,443
No. Thanks, Kate.
If you could wait outside, please.

103
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,493
- Well?
- I have no clue.

104
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,250
Who are those people? You know?

105
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,420
No idea.

106
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,764
Thanks for coming in, guys.

107
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,019
Will you come back in, Kate?

108
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:34,777
DOJ wants advisors that focus on cartels
involved in pursuing Mr. Diaz.

109
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,780
This is Matt Graver.
He'll be leading the team.

110
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,867
Isn't this Phoenix homicide now?

111
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:44,370
No, we're expanding
the scope of the investigation a bit.

112
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,372
You'll act as a liaison.

113
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,498
What does that mean?

114
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:51,127
They need an agent
with tactical experience, like you.

115
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,463
State Department
is pulling an agent from the field

116
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,716
that specializes in responding
to escalated cartel activity.

117
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,219
You'll be part of the team.

118
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:02,096
You'll meet up with them at Luke tomorrow?

119
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,389
Day after. Early.

120
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,474
Air Force Base?

121
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,850
Yeah, we're gonna go see Guillermo.

122
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,310
Diaz's brother?

123
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,811
That's the one.

124
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,439
Where is he?

125
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,901
He's in the El Paso area.

126
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:18,863
What's our objective?

127
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,953
To dramatically overreact.

128
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:31,334
Kate, you must volunteer
for an inter-agency task force.

129
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,921
Think very hard before you respond.

130
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,840
You wanna be a part of this?

131
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,179
Do we get an opportunity
at the men responsible for today?

132
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,519
The men who were really responsible
for today, yeah.

133
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,232
I'll volunteer.

134
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,832
Papa!

135
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,553
<i>Sí.</i>

136
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,514
No.

137
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,602
You keep an eye on that doughy prick
with the flip-flops.

138
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,686
Don't trust him.

139
00:14:58,898 --> 00:14:59,982
How you doin', sir?

140
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,317
I.D.'s?

141
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,993
She's on the list, but you're not.

142
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,120
Well, what's she supposed to do?

143
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,496
I need you to turn this around for me.

144
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,914
It's fine. It's good.

145
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,291
I'll call you when we're headed back.

146
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,501
All right.

147
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,774
- Morning.
- Morning. Am I late?

148
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,277
No, no, no. We just landed.
Come on, this way.

149
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,614
My bird dog over there, Alejandro.

150
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,828
We're taking this?

151
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,080
Yeah. Only the best for you.

152
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,305
DOD flies you around in private jets now?

153
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,973
Yeah. You guys don't have one of these?

154
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,224
Right.

155
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,979
Is there any food on this flight?

156
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:24,650
Some bitchin' peanuts in the back.
But it's kind of a self-serve deal.

157
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:36,996
Kate Macer.

158
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,582
Have you been to Juárez before?

159
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,879
No, I... We're goin' to El Paso, right?

160
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,174
Yeah, amazing. Okay.

161
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,677
Are you okay?

162
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:20,600
Yeah. I'm fine.

163
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,275
So...

164
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,861
So, this is your specialty?

165
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,157
The cartels in Mexico are your specialty?

166
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,451
Yeah. Yeah.

167
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,581
Is there anything I should know?

168
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,835
You're asking me how a watch works.

169
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,506
For now, just keep an eye on the time.

170
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,887
Okay.

171
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,150
How you doin'?

172
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,985
Howdy! How you been?

173
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,154
Good, buddy. How you feelin'?

174
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,740
Well, when I pee, it burns.

175
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,034
Maybe it's gonorrhea.

176
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,078
What color is it?

177
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,163
Yellow with red specks.

178
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,082
Red specks or blood?

179
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,712
I'm tr yin' to get DOD to let me look into this
conspiracy to sink Fiji.

180
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:32,922
- Fiji?
- Yeah.

181
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,674
Leave Fiji alone, terrorists!

182
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:38,094
Exactly. I figure a month or two over there,
we'll get it all worked out.

183
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,137
So, who's goin' over there today?

184
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,473
Marshals, DEA...
I pulled a team for you, Matt.

185
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,017
Oh, man, I love it when you say "a team."
It makes me all warm and fuzzy.

186
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,562
They're a crack bunch, too.
Just rotated back from Afghanistan.

187
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,523
Where's everybody linkin' up?

188
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,441
A.I.C.

189
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,819
Good, good, good.

190
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,749
Mexican Federal Police
will meet you at the border,

191
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,627
and proceed with you to the courthouse,
located here.

192
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,464
This is a high-level target.

193
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:22,805
The most likely spots for an attempt
will be at the exchange,

194
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,391
and at the border crossing on the return.

195
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,935
The Marshals will enter...

196
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,438
Kevin, Keith, you wanna stand up?

197
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,567
Now, the Marshals' response team
is in Laredo...

198
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,735
Love Texans.

199
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,779
...so our friends from Delta
have volunteered to come along,

200
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,532
and will escort the Marshals
on the exchange.

201
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,909
And here's the man of the hour.

202
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,911
You comin' with or waitin' here?

203
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,622
We'll take the tour with you.
Loan us a couple pop guns.

204
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,833
All right, this is turnin' into an all-star affair!

205
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,585
Keith, you want another hand
on the exchange?

206
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:53,794
You sober?

207
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,213
Will be by the time we get there.

208
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:58,674
Got a bottle in the truck
in case your hands get shaky.

209
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,426
I know I could always count on you, Keith.

210
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,386
All right, we'll gear you up
as soon as we're done here.

211
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,849
Now, Matt, you can be the tip of the spear,
and we don't have to rob a guy from Delta.

212
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,934
Now, be careful on the turnaround.

213
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,437
If the Federale's a shooter,
it's gonna happen on the turnaround.

214
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,315
Delta's Team One will be the lead vehicle.

215
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:18,611
We can divide Team Two between the
carry car and the trail vehicle. That okay?

216
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,362
Good. Now, Delta,
if you can identify yourselves,

217
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,365
so everyone knows who to hide behind
if shit hits the fan.

218
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:28,537
The most likely spot for a hit will be
at the border crossing on the return.

219
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:33,417
Anywhere along the way, anyone not
in this room is a potential shooter.

220
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,546
The op isn't over until we get back here.

221
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:39,423
Okay?

222
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,260
Be alert. Be vigilant. And be aware. Let's go.

223
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,138
What?

224
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,148
Hey! I thought you were in prison.

225
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,525
They took me out.

226
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,360
They needed somebody for this job.

227
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:01,403
For good behavior or bad behavior?

228
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,162
Have you ever been over there?

229
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,874
I worked in Juárez.

230
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,504
For the DEA?

231
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,464
No.

232
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,133
For who?

233
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,510
For Mexico.

234
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,263
I was a prosecutor.

235
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,935
You're not American?

236
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,186
No.

237
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,688
Who do you work for now?

238
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,191
I go where I'm sent.

239
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,194
Where were you sent from?

240
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,197
Cartagena.

241
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:48,534
Colombia.

242
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,662
Listen...

243
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:55,332
Nothing will make sense
to your American ears.

244
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,587
And you will doubt everything that we do.

245
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:04,758
But in the end, you will understand.

246
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,517
Here, try this on. See if it fits.

247
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,978
Is he CIA? Are you?

248
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,981
He's a DOD advisor, just like me.

249
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,357
No, he's not.

250
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:23,277
Just pay attention to Alejandro.
If he says to do somethin', just do it.

251
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,738
I'm not authorized to follow orders
from Alejandro!

252
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,156
Especially in Mexico!

253
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,574
Fine. Then stay here.

254
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,785
But you don't want to, do you?

255
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,621
I just wanna know what I'm getting into.

256
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,208
Kate, you volunteered to get on this train
because you know

257
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:42,338
you're doing nothing in Phoenix.
You're just sweeping up a fucking mess.

258
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,675
In six months, every single house you raid
will be rigged with explosives.

259
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,261
Do you want to find the guys responsible?
Yes or no?

260
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,387
Yes.

261
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:51,639
- Yes?
- Yes!

262
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,059
This is where we start.

263
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,478
Try it on.

264
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:44,918
There she is.

265
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,920
The beast.

266
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:48,797
Juárez.

267
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:52,968
You know,

268
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:57,556
1900s, President Taft
went to visit President Díaz.

269
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,184
Took 4,000 men with him.

270
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,811
And it almost was called off.

271
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,022
Some guy had a pistol.

272
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:08,233
Was gonna walk right up to Taft
and just blow his brains out.

273
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:11,570
But it was avoided. 4,000 troops!

274
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,156
Think he felt safe?

275
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,501
Welcome to Juárez.

276
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,334
It's brilliant what they do.

277
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,837
When they mutilate a body like that,

278
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,799
they make people think
they must have been involved,

279
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,927
they must have deserved such a death
'cause they did something.

280
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,013
It's brilliant what they do.

281
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,412
You hear that?

282
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,623
Those aren't firecrackers.

283
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,669
<i>Mexicans are adjusting our route.</i>

284
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:59,047
<i>There's activity ahead,
we need to go around. Everyone hold on.</i>

285
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:30,847
Nothing will happen here.

286
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,934
They try anything, it will be at the border.

287
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,360
Keep an eye out for the State Police.

288
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,531
They're not always the good guys.

289
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,577
Spotter vehicle, left lane. Left lane!

290
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,328
<i>Spotter vehicle, nine o'clock.</i>

291
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,456
I'm gettin' a boner.

292
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:39,708
<i>Is that one of ours?</i>

293
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,585
Watch the right, watch the right.

294
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,462
<i>No, that's a lone wolf</i>

295
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,012
<i>Eyes on rooftops.</i>

296
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,479
<i>Nothing.</i>

297
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:01,938
<i>Rooftops clear.</i>

298
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:08,403
<i>Bridge is one klick out. Road is secure.
Hotfoot it, gentlemen.</i>

299
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:18,663
<i>Everyone stay in this lane.
Our agents at the border are</i>

300
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,291
<i>waving traffic through
to get us over as quickly as they can.</i>

301
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,680
<i>Everyone stay frosty.</i>

302
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,438
<i>Okay, it's a fuck-up.
What are we gonna do now?</i>

303
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,530
<i>Here's the deal. A car broke down up ahead.</i>

304
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:55,825
<i>It's being sorted out,
but it's gonna take a while. Stand by.</i>

305
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,151
Get your service weapon out.

306
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,865
Red Impala, two lanes over, on my ten.

307
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:39,369
Copy that. Red Impala, two lanes left.

308
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,246
<i>Roger that.</i>

309
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,260
<i>Three lanes left. Seven o'clock. Green Civic.</i>

310
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,730
Bring your window down.

311
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,071
Gun.

312
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,906
Gun! Gun left!

313
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,116
<i>What are the rules here?</i>

314
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,161
<i>We must be engaged to engage.</i>

315
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,290
<i>Permission to get out of the vehicle
and set a perimeter?</i>

316
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:26,791
<i>Stay in your vehicle.</i>

317
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:30,045
<i>You can do what they do.
If they get out, you get out.</i>

318
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,860
<i>Get ready. They can see our lane clearing.</i>

319
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,403
<i>If it's coming, it's coming now.</i>

320
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,296
<i>Move!</i>

321
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,422
Wait, wait, wait!

322
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:15,507
Get outta the car.

323
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,426
Jesus Christ!

324
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:32,899
Don't move!

325
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,151
No, no, no, no!

326
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,922
What the fuck are we doing?

327
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:18,528
Fuck!

328
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,238
Lane's clear! The lane's clear!

329
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,448
Don't look at me!

330
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:25,285
Put your hands behind your head! Go!
Hands behind your head!

331
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,828
- All clear!
- I got this!

332
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,747
Go, go, go!

333
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,460
Move, move, move!

334
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,130
<i>This is gonna be on the front page
of every newspaper in America.</i>

335
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,550
No, it won't.
It won't even make the papers in El Paso.

336
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,054
Clear!

337
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,354
Got a little nutty, huh?

338
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,357
Nutty? Yeah, that was fucking illegal.

339
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,276
You wanna start a war?
You're a fucking spook!

340
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:42,821
And him! I mean, who the fuck is that?

341
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,197
Told you, you could stay here.

342
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,325
Jesus Christ. You just spray bullets at...

343
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,452
Yeah, sure, there's just
fucking civilians everywhere.

344
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:51,371
I'm not a soldier! This is not what I do!

345
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,165
Whoa! Don't sell yourself short, all right?

346
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,126
The reason Reggie's home is
I know he wasn't ready for this.

347
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,839
But he better get ready real quick
because this is the future, Kate!

348
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,424
Juárez is what happens when they dig in.
This is it!

349
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:04,509
What am I doing here?

350
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,803
What you're doing here is
you're giving us the opportunity

351
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,806
to shake the tree and create chaos.
That's what this is!

352
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,978
In the meantime,
just sponge everything up you see.

353
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:15,270
Learn! That's why you're here.

354
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:15,353
Learn! That's why you're here.

355
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,021
Learn! That's why you're here.

356
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,921
Guillermo...

357
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,136
You're giving him a belly full of water,
you devil.

358
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,351
You didn't think we'd get you here, did you?

359
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,896
<i>No hablo Inglés.</i>

360
00:39:57,979 --> 00:39:59,606
<i>No hablo Inglés?</i>

361
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,821
I love it when they <i>no hablo Inglés.</i>

362
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:11,159
You know, I brought an old buddy of yours.

363
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:15,622
I bet you <i>hablo</i> to him. Yeah.

364
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,466
I didn't know ghosts got thirsty.

365
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,807
I know someone kept him alive for us.

366
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,354
I doubt it was easy.

367
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,606
What's easy these days?

368
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,859
I'm sorry about
what happened on the return.

369
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,653
I control only what I can.

370
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,656
It's not your fault.

371
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,216
There's rumors of a tunnel.

372
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,386
Fausto's main road into Arizona.

373
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:15,807
If you're doing what I think you're doing,
that's the best place to cross.

374
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,143
If you can find it. But time is against you.

375
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,146
In three days,
nobody will be where they are today.

376
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:24,816
Shall we?

377
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:28,987
No, it's better if you don't.
Something happens in that room,

378
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,116
it's easier to say you didn't see anything.

379
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,604
Well, Alejandro, I think he remembers you.

380
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,815
I'm gonna step out.

381
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,150
Timmy.

382
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,217
What do you keep lookin' at me for?

383
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,011
<i>No hablo Inglés,</i> remember?

384
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:21,182
No, no.

385
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,082
Can I have one of those?

386
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,084
Thank you.

387
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,939
- You like fireworks?
- Huh?

388
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:12,066
Wanna see something cool?

389
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,734
Come on.

390
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:49,937
Here we go.

391
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,776
Look right there.

392
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,044
Unbelievable.

393
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:13,669
That's what happens when
you chop the head off a chicken.

394
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:13,753
That's what happens when
you chop the head off a chicken.

395
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:16,047
That's what happens when
you chop the head off a chicken.

396
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,131
Yeah.

397
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,675
I can see.

398
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,846
Can you get 'em all in one place?

399
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:27,099
We just landed back in Phoenix.
I'm on the clock, I can't wait.

400
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:32,146
All right, look, contact Bob Fisks.
Have him hold 'em in the staging area.

401
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,732
How long does it take to get to Tucson?

402
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,275
From here, it's a little over two hours.

403
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:39,278
All right. We'll be there around 2:00. Yeah.

404
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,865
Are we going to Tucson?

405
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:45,159
Yeah, you gotta learn
how to sleep on a plane.

406
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,954
They let me on the base
when you need a ride, don't they?

407
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,080
You okay?

408
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,665
- She's fine.
- I didn't ask you.

409
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,083
And yet I answered.

410
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:56,796
Kate,

411
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:58,506
who's that?

412
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,008
We're goin' to Tucson.

413
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,796
What's the deal, Matt?
Why you holdin' up my transport?

414
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:40,214
Don't worry, Bob. We'll be quick.

415
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:44,719
How's the auditor gonna react to
an $8,000 check to fuckin' Domino's Pizza?

416
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,638
Don't be so dramatic, okay?
This is Kate Macer with the FBI.

417
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:49,307
This is her partner, what's-his-name.
It was her call.

418
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:52,351
It wasn't my call.
Have you got another one of those?

419
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,402
Finish it before you get up there.

420
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,486
No problem.

421
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:05,698
Hey, Kate.

422
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,743
Tell me what happened in El Paso.

423
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:12,371
We weren't in El Paso. We were in Mexico.

424
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,633
I guess we're not following any procedures.

425
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,009
What do you wanna do?

426
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:10,179
We want to talk to the people
caught around the Nogales area.

427
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:15,643
Okay. That group.

428
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,981
This group here. And that group.

429
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:25,027
Okay. They stay and the rest can go.

430
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,570
Josef!

431
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,676
On the bus. <i>Ándale.</i>

432
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,530
What are we looking for?

433
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:13,367
Just keep watching.

434
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,932
- In Arizona.
- Arizona?

435
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,719
- Arizona.
- Arizona...

436
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,266
Talk to me. What are we doing?

437
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:20,893
I don't have any answers for you.

438
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,394
Let's get some, then.

439
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:24,021
Do you think
I haven't asked these questions?

440
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,105
Do you think you can do better?

441
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:26,190
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.

442
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,067
Matt, can we talk for a minute?

443
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:40,204
What's up?

444
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:42,831
Everything okay?

445
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,126
You look very serious.

446
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,588
There's "in the dark"
and there's the way you're treating us.

447
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,757
I want to know the objective or I walk,
period.

448
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,803
Then go.
I didn't ask you to be here. She did.

449
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,471
I walk, too.

450
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:09,191
- What do you wanna know?
- Everything.

451
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:10,693
Fuckin' lawyers.

452
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:12,319
All right.

453
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,281
Guillermo

454
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,494
told us about a tunnel east of Nogales,
near Sasabe.

455
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:24,748
Now we're tr yin' to find out
what areas near there migrants avoid,

456
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,417
so we can find the tunnel.

457
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:29,712
That better?

458
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:30,796
And Guillermo is...

459
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,881
Guillermo, he just told you
where the drug tunnel is?

460
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:34,008
He just told you?

461
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,759
Guillermo didn't have any other options.

462
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:37,928
We send him back across the border,
he's a dead man.

463
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:41,056
Now he gets to spend the next 30 years
in an American prison,

464
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,601
in relative safety.

465
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,227
Just tell us the truth, man.

466
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:54,361
We are gonna make enough noise

467
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:58,407
that Manuel Diaz is called back to Mexico
to see his boss.

468
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,534
That's the truth.

469
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:01,744
And then?

470
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,413
And then we know where his boss is.

471
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:10,377
His name is Fausto Alarcon <i>el verdugo.</i>

472
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,134
Every day across that border,

473
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:22,056
people are kidnapped or killed
by his hand or with his blessing.

474
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:28,812
To find him would be like
discovering a vaccine.

475
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,734
You understand the value of that.

476
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:42,076
All right, we're good.
Just don't keep us in the dark.

477
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,535
Great!

478
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,038
You afraid of the dark?

479
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:50,709
Hey!

480
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,546
It's been a humdinger of a day.
Go home. Get some rest.

481
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:57,591
We'll find our own ride.
We'll see you tomorrow!

482
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,885
I just drove a hundred fucking miles.

483
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,845
It's a fucking blessing, trust me.

484
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,013
Got you smokin' again?

485
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:04,098
Yeah.

486
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,559
Who the fuck's Guillermo?

487
00:55:02,758 --> 00:55:04,885
Gotta get you a new bra, woman.

488
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,554
The list of things I need.

489
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:09,681
I'm just saying. Some nice lacy somethin'.

490
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,811
It's been a while since someone's
seen me in a bra, except you.

491
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,981
Oh, God, don't look at me like that.
I don't want your pity.

492
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,275
How was seeing Evan the other day?

493
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,361
I don't know...

494
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,279
- Miss him?
- Ask me something else.

495
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,914
I used to see guys like Matt in Iraq.
Gotta be careful around these people.

496
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,416
CIA's not supposed to
work this side of the fence.

497
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,043
He's a DOD advisor.

498
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,670
You really believe that?

499
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,758
You need somebody watching your six,
'cause I promise you they aren't.

500
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,593
You know,

501
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:51,265
we're not even scratching the surface
doing what we're doing.

502
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,349
And they are.

503
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,478
Well, you sure
picked the motherfuckers to show us.

504
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:14,830
What's the password?

505
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,207
Moron.

506
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:38,186
This is our spot.

507
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:43,066
No way! No, no.

508
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,176
Are you getting this?

509
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,820
That's our way across.

510
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,699
So, Guillermo was tellin' the truth?

511
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:35,827
It's gonna be a good day.

512
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:40,499
Hey, Kate.
Got any friends at Phoenix SWAT?

513
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,292
Yeah, we use them in breaches all the time.

514
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:43,752
Good, 'cause we're gonna need their help.

515
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:44,878
What for?

516
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:48,131
We are gonna fuck with
Manuel Diaz's wallet.

517
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:43,061
This is our Smurf, guys.
Blonde hair, white purse.

518
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,446
- You know the Heimlich?
- Oh, yeah.

519
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,407
She tries to eat that deposit receipt,
you Heimlich it right out of her, hear me?

520
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,491
Copy that.

521
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:03,999
There she goes. All right, go get 'em, tiger.

522
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,292
Take 'em.

523
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,889
<i>Hold still! Hold still!</i>

524
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,019
You want bank computers for evidence?

525
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:27,606
No, no. Just the money.
But freeze all his accounts, everything.

526
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:30,025
Even if his dog opened an account,
I want you to freeze it.

527
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,324
Who you got?

528
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,203
Got a mobile money launderer.

529
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,042
Pack it up.

530
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,878
Come on. Come on.

531
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,553
You coming?

532
00:59:58,637 --> 00:59:59,679
No, don't go in the bank.

533
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,723
This is something
we can actually build a case on.

534
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:03,600
Don't go in the bank, Kate!

535
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,393
There you go, and she's goin' in the bank.

536
01:00:22,661 --> 01:00:24,496
These are all Manuel Diaz's accounts?

537
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:27,916
Yeah. Cash deposits made daily
in $9,000 increments.

538
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:30,293
- So, it doesn't have to be reported.
- That's right.

539
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:31,628
And you can seize that?

540
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:35,006
I already have. And I'll go through
these wire transfer numbers and

541
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,050
freeze all these accounts as well.

542
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,177
Here you go.

543
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:44,891
- Damn, that's smart.
- What?

544
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,686
This is a bank line of credit.

545
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:50,981
See, you make payments
over what you owe,

546
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,775
and it doesn't show up as cash,
it shows up as a negative loan balance.

547
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:58,697
It's never reported to anyone. IRS, DEA...
This money is invisible.

548
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,157
How much does he have?

549
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:02,409
Take a look.

550
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,038
Oh, my God.

551
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:11,835
They just seized $17 million.

552
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,587
- It's a bogus bust, Kate.
- What?

553
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,673
You can't prosecute it. No one controls
who deposits money in an account.

554
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,341
An attorney will have that money back
in a few months,

555
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:19,968
but a lot of heads will roll before that.

556
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:22,387
But we can arrest Manuel for now.
We can get him off the street.

557
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:25,599
We gotta get Manuel called back to Mexico.
That's the objective...

558
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,350
We have no jurisdiction in Mexico.

559
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:30,020
We have nothing.
We need to do something now.

560
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:31,438
Can't arrest him.

561
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:51,291
What?

562
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,585
When?

563
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:57,589
Wait a minute.

564
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:22,864
$9,000 is deposited into this account
every day in cash,

565
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:24,115
for five years.

566
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:27,285
That's not illegal.
It's suspect, but it isn't illegal.

567
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,204
I think the IRS might think it's illegal.

568
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,289
What do you want, Kate?
What would you like done here?

569
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:33,792
I want to follow
some semblance of procedure.

570
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,044
That's what I want.
To build a prosecutable case.

571
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,506
We prosecuted more felony drug cases
in this region last year

572
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,217
than in the two previous years combined.

573
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,636
Are you feeling that on the street?

574
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:47,430
You getting the vibe that we're winning?

575
01:02:50,642 --> 01:02:52,310
No.

576
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:54,396
Do you?

577
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:55,730
No sir, I don't.

578
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:01,111
Advisors like Matt come in,
they stir the pot,

579
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,822
they cause the criminals
to react and make mistakes.

580
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,408
That's how we build cases
against the individuals

581
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,576
that actually make a difference in this fight.

582
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:11,871
It's when they're nervous,
when they stop trusting their crews,

583
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:13,915
when they move their money.

584
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,875
These are all opportunities to strike.

585
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,129
And that's the purpose of people like Matt.

586
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:22,257
Kate, this isn't something
that I dreamed up myself.

587
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:25,969
I don't have the authority to hire advisors,

588
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,680
or authorize joint agency missions,

589
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:31,016
or fly agents from Air Force bases.

590
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,519
Are you understanding me?

591
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:37,689
These decisions are made far from here

592
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:41,818
by officials elected to office,
not appointed to them.

593
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:45,947
So, if your fear is operating out of bounds,

594
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:48,908
I am telling you, you are not.

595
01:03:50,702 --> 01:03:52,620
The boundary's been moved.

596
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:55,707
Are we clear?

597
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,251
Yes, sir.

598
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,465
I need a fucking drink.

599
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,759
- Where do you wanna go?
- Anywhere.

600
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:43,171
I'm gonna go get a table.

601
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:44,923
- I guess it's on me.
- Thanks.

602
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:50,261
- What'll it be?
- Two beers.

603
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:12,700
Thank you.

604
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,635
I want a cigarette so bad.

605
01:05:36,891 --> 01:05:37,976
Macer?

606
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:39,978
Yeah?

607
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:42,188
I hate to go on about this,

608
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:45,692
but I think the bra situation's
the least of your problems.

609
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:46,818
Okay...

610
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,778
'Cause you look like shit.

611
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:51,906
You do. You look like shit.
Everybody on the team's talkin' about it.

612
01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:54,409
They're like, "Kate used to be
a number one draft pick.

613
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,244
"Now look at her.
She looks like fuckin' shit."

614
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,371
Look at you. Your eyebrows are a mess.

615
01:05:58,455 --> 01:05:59,581
No, they're not!

616
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:02,167
They're like caterpillars, like wild beasts.
You're losing weight...

617
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,293
I'm eating.

618
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,587
Look at you. What is it, one T-shirt a week?

619
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:08,131
At least work
on your personal hygiene, huh?

620
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,257
You sound like my mother.

621
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,717
Maybe I am your mother.

622
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:14,762
First we work on personal hygiene,
then we move on to the shopping.

623
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:17,557
Get you some potatoes, yeah?
Eat some food...

624
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,642
Where have you taken me?
What is this place?

625
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:21,978
It's a bar.

626
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,271
It's full o' cowboys.

627
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:24,856
I'm a cowboy.

628
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,232
You're a redneck.

629
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:29,903
I'm a redneck. Got a trailer. Got a wife.

630
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,154
What are you talking about?

631
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,906
I got a trailer, I got a wife. She's my sister.

632
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:35,950
Hey, Reg.

633
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:38,161
- Ted!
- What's goin' on?

634
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,205
- Long time. How you been?
- Yeah, it's good to see you, man.

635
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:41,456
Good to see you, too. How you been?

636
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:42,665
Gettin' your groove on, huh?

637
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:44,292
We're just startin'. We just got here.

638
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:47,378
All right. You gonna introduce me, man?

639
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:49,506
Ted, Phoenix PD, Kate, my partner.

640
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:50,840
How you doin'? Just Ted, it's fine.

641
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:53,051
I saw you play softball once.

642
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:54,177
Softball?

643
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,971
She was at the game, Ted.

644
01:06:57,055 --> 01:06:58,389
"The game?"

645
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:00,767
Where you struck out in slow-pitch softball.

646
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:02,602
You played really, really well.

647
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:03,853
I appreciate that.

648
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:07,690
I'm gonna head back to that bar now.
Can I get y'all another round?

649
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,150
Yeah, sure.

650
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,401
All right.

651
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:13,905
Ted, he's a good guy.

652
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:17,951
Divorced.

653
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:36,654
Just give me one second,
I'll be right with you.

654
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,325
All right...

655
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,221
Just wait, wait a second...

656
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:04,223
What, what? Is it too much?

657
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:06,225
Just wait one minute.
I just need a second.

658
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:08,478
All right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

659
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,403
Hey, Kate?

660
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:21,032
Hey! Hey, come here, stop, stop, talk to me.

661
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:25,370
Just talk to me. Okay?
Relax. Okay? Just take it...

662
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:27,121
Whoa, shit! Kate...

663
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:31,125
What is it? What? Stop.

664
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:33,211
Stop. Stop.

665
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:35,380
Shit, what the fuck! What did you...

666
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:38,925
- Don't...
- What the fuck are you...

667
01:09:40,468 --> 01:09:41,552
God damn!

668
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:45,765
You fuckin' try to shoot me?
You fuckin' crazy?

669
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,811
- Stop that!
- Get off me!

670
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:53,356
Fuck that...

671
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:56,234
Damn it, Kate! Just fucking stop!

672
01:09:58,736 --> 01:09:59,737
Stop!

673
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:07,578
Stop, bitch! Stop! Fuck!

674
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,707
Fuckin' stop!

675
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:15,628
Stop.

676
01:10:18,673 --> 01:10:19,674
Fuck!

677
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:26,848
This is you, you hear me? You did this.
You did this.

678
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,177
You used me as bait.

679
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,805
Nah, you used yourself as bait.

680
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:10,224
I told you not to go in the bank.

681
01:11:13,686 --> 01:11:16,439
You brought him back here, though.
That was smart.

682
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:19,358
Yeah. Love how
we're gonna pretend like I planned this.

683
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:22,028
Why don't you just write that in your report.

684
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:24,614
Come on! This is good news!

685
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:27,825
They're gonna call Manuel back soon.

686
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:30,703
Isn't that the point?

687
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,385
It's okay, Reg.

688
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:51,182
I thought he was a friend.

689
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:52,266
I know.

690
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:59,148
- Want me to stay tonight?
- No. I'm good.

691
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:00,775
- You sure?
- I'm good.

692
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,241
How y'all want me to talk to you
when you keep fuckin' hittin' me?

693
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:13,204
How many other corrupt motherfuckers are
you workin' with on this side of the border?

694
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:15,498
All right. Look...

695
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:19,669
It's exactly what I told you, all right?

696
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:24,632
They came to me
and they wanted details about our case,

697
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:28,177
and yes, I did it, I gave it to them,
but I never wanted anybody to get hurt.

698
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:30,054
I would have never gotten involved
with them pieces of shit

699
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:31,138
if I thought that there was any...

700
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:35,852
Fuck! Okay! Fuck! Okay!

701
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:40,606
"Okay, okay, okay,"
is not what we're lookin' for, Ted.

702
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,570
You know what the beauty is
of you being so beat to a pulp?

703
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:49,282
'Cause no one's gonna notice
a few more scratches.

704
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:52,201
This is a new deal, Ted.

705
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:58,624
I'm the one who decides whether
your daughter'll get Federal protection,

706
01:12:58,749 --> 01:12:59,750
Fuck...

707
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:02,962
or whether we post
your ex-wife's address on the Internet.

708
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:09,260
I decide whether you go to prison
in a work camp in Missouri,

709
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:12,054
or a kill house like Corcoran.

710
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,181
All right.

711
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:17,768
This is where you negotiate
how to survive, my friend.

712
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:22,857
Okay. Look...

713
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:27,862
I feel like this whole thing's
just gotten away from me...

714
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:33,409
I fucked up. Okay, I fucked up
and I'm in over my fuckin' head right now.

715
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:35,453
I'm sorry...

716
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:38,331
Fuck it! Get it out! Get it the fuck out!

717
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,669
Fuck! Get it the fuck out! Get it out!

718
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:46,297
Motherfucker! And fuck you!

719
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:47,840
Fuck!

720
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:52,136
How many officers
do they have working on the force?

721
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,140
I'll tell you anything you wanna know.

722
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:59,477
You just gotta promise me that
my daughter's gonna be safe, okay?

723
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,771
You make me that promise.

724
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:03,522
You want the truth?

725
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,024
Please.

726
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:12,073
Give me all the names

727
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:15,868
of all the motherfuckers
they got working on the force.

728
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:17,411
Okay, okay...

729
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:18,996
- All right?
- Okay...

730
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:22,708
Okay. So, which phone do we start with?

731
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:24,377
It's in that one. That shitty one.

732
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,462
- That's the shitty one?
- Yes, sir!

733
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:44,105
How you feelin'?

734
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:48,359
Better.

735
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:53,656
Well, you should've shot him.

736
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:03,958
I just tried to have sex with my hitman.

737
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:08,170
Nah. He's no assassin.

738
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:11,549
He just wanted to know what you know.

739
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:14,176
They're after us, not you.

740
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:20,391
Thank you.

741
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:36,866
You remind me
of someone very special to me.

742
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:47,960
Get some rest.

743
01:15:49,754 --> 01:15:52,256
Tomorrow they'll call Manuel Diaz
back to Mexico,

744
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:55,092
and we'll cut a leg from them.

745
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:31,629
<i>Hello, sixty.</i>

746
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:45,601
<i>We have eyes on the objective.
Can we get a closer visual?</i>

747
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:52,817
<i>Ten meters going by the eastern ridge.</i>

748
01:16:57,988 --> 01:16:59,031
Papa?

749
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:32,982
- Football?
- Sí, Papa.

750
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:52,668
No!

751
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:21,155
Come on in.

752
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:22,448
Tasty beverage?

753
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:25,910
Okay, boys.

754
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:29,246
What's going on? What's the plan?

755
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:30,748
We're going hunting.

756
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:34,627
Looks like Manuel Diaz
is being called back to Mexico.

757
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,420
Just waiting for confirmation.

758
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:39,173
There's the tunnel right there.

759
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:41,258
All right, listen up.

760
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,469
Let's clarify the op.

761
01:18:44,178 --> 01:18:45,804
We're gonna drive to location,
proceed on foot...

762
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:47,556
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

763
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:49,683
- I'm fine.
- How's the neck?

764
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:51,143
It's better, thank you.

765
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:52,937
Good, good.

766
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:55,856
These diagrams are based on
other tunnels that have been mapped.

767
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:57,733
They're for reference only,
they're not accurate.

768
01:18:58,359 --> 01:19:02,029
Once on the Mexican side of the border,
there'll be a small staging area,

769
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:04,281
then another shaft
will lead to the main warehouse

770
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:06,033
and the road that returns to Mexico.

771
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:09,995
Once we clear the mules,
we don't expect more than a dozen bandits.

772
01:19:10,496 --> 01:19:13,165
No, they use Mexican police
for vehicle transport.

773
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:16,085
If you see a uniform in the tunnel,
consider him a bandit, too.

774
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:19,964
Okay. You want to discuss ROE?

775
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:21,966
Nah, we'll save that for later.

776
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:23,050
Okay.

777
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:26,845
This is an in and out.
We're clearing, placing an agent.

778
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:29,098
It's all about creating a diversion.

779
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:31,475
Want the mother of all diversions, boys.

780
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:34,645
Need a lot of noise.
Fourth of July on steroids.

781
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,691
All right. Weapons check. Let's go, boys.

782
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,030
This looks like confirmation.

783
01:19:54,415 --> 01:19:56,625
- I need to fit your guy with a locator.
- Yeah, do it.

784
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,961
Those are Special Ops.
Are we going in on this?

785
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,629
Nah. You guys aren't really dressed for it.

786
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:01,797
You didn't fuckin' tell us.

787
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,841
Yeah, well, you two went
or yin' to Daddy yesterday, and we

788
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:05,884
- don't want Daddy to know everything.
- Give me a fucking break!

789
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,219
All right, we'll get you some extra gear.

790
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:08,679
We have tac gear in the car.

791
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:11,223
All right. Good. You guys will hang back
when we get there, okay?

792
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:12,308
Then why are we going?

793
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,185
'Cause CIA
can't operate within US borders

794
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:17,604
without a domestic agency attached.

795
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:22,693
I told you you'd be useful.

796
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:25,362
So, that's it. That's why I'm here.

797
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:28,949
Yeah, that's it.

798
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,035
That's why you're here.

799
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:34,955
Hey, we find any drugs,
you guys get to confiscate 'em.

800
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:36,707
It's gonna be a big day.

801
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,128
Un-fuckin' real!

802
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:50,387
Front and back.

803
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:54,516
Kate, come on. Fuck these people, man.
They've been using us from the beginning.

804
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:55,768
We don't have to do this.

805
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,186
I need to know what they used us for.

806
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,188
- Doesn't matter what!
- Yes, it does!

807
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:03,776
I say we walk and make them
eat this whole fucked-up operation.

808
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:05,152
No. I have to know.

809
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:17,790
<i>Black Mercedes... Plate number:
Romeo-India-November-</i>

810
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:22,086
<i>three-one-Bravo-seven.
Heading south by southeast.</i>

811
01:22:34,825 --> 01:22:35,909
<i>Where?</i>

812
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:38,662
Okay.

813
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:41,915
We gotta hit the tunnel
the minute we get on the ground.

814
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:44,918
Pretty exciting, huh?

815
01:22:57,806 --> 01:22:59,141
What is the target's location?

816
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:02,853
<i>14 miles south of Nogales
heading west rapidly.</i>

817
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:16,867
Keep your fuckin' safeties on,
barrels pointed down.

818
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:18,869
Stay in the back.

819
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:22,539
Don't shoot anyone
on my fuckin' team. Right?

820
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:56,907
Gear check?

821
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:01,328
Thermal camera check.

822
01:24:01,411 --> 01:24:02,955
Night vision goggles check.

823
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:04,581
Get those guys.

824
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:06,083
Wanna take Alpha squad, I'll take B squad?

825
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,168
- You got it. Let's do it.
- Let's go, boys.

826
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:19,513
Control, do you copy?

827
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:22,057
<i>Roger, Alpha. We read.</i>

828
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:07,829
<i>Fifty meters. Your three o'clock, Alpha.</i>

829
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:26,431
<i>Stand by. Getting close to objective.</i>

830
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:38,652
<i>Alpha, Bravo, be advised.
12 meters straight ahead.</i>

831
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:05,303
All right, we need to boogie and
we need to do it quiet till we find the center.

832
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:07,931
Draw the fighters to you
and make some noise.

833
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:10,058
Don't follow me. I'll be fine.

834
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:12,978
What are the rules of engagement?

835
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:16,732
Weapons free, my friend. Weapons free.

836
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:19,109
Weapons free, boys.

837
01:27:19,776 --> 01:27:20,902
Good luck.

838
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:10,243
Oh, God!

839
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:37,223
- You okay?
- My gun!

840
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:39,392
Leave it. Stay on my six.

841
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:35,907
Freeze!

842
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:39,536
Step away from him.

843
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:40,745
Put that down.

844
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:42,706
I mean it! Move away from him right now!

845
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:51,923
Don't ever point a weapon at me again.

846
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:55,510
Catch your breath. Then get back up there.

847
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:30,795
I am through. Do you have my location?

848
01:32:31,337 --> 01:32:34,591
<i>Roger, we have you.
Target is east and north of you.</i>

849
01:32:35,091 --> 01:32:39,512
<i>Looks like Highway 56 to 17.
Will intercept him if he stays on 17.</i>

850
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:41,973
<i>Go east on 56 off Highway 2.</i>

851
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:43,641
Wilco.

852
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:04,913
Is he through yet?

853
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:08,708
<i>We have joy. GPS is transmitting.
Audio is transmitting.</i>

854
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,585
<i>Should intercept in 20.</i>

855
01:33:12,045 --> 01:33:14,839
That was a clean, clean fucking op,
my friend.

856
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:16,674
Except for these two assholes.

857
01:33:17,258 --> 01:33:19,427
Well, you're better overseas.
You don't have to babysit.

858
01:33:19,511 --> 01:33:20,595
Where's Kate?

859
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:22,514
I thought she was with you.

860
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:24,933
We gotta go back.

861
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:28,186
Shit. Boys, we're missin' one. Let's go.

862
01:33:36,736 --> 01:33:37,737
Hey!

863
01:33:44,077 --> 01:33:46,538
Just lay back, baby. Let it happen.

864
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:53,419
Stop! Stop!

865
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:55,547
Get off me!

866
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,298
Stop moving! Stop!

867
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:03,054
Stop it.

868
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:06,432
Just relax. Just relax.

869
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:10,812
All right? You gonna stay there?

870
01:34:10,895 --> 01:34:12,564
Are you gonna stay there?

871
01:34:26,953 --> 01:34:27,996
All right.

872
01:34:30,123 --> 01:34:31,249
Now, you listen.

873
01:34:36,129 --> 01:34:38,089
You went up the wrong tunnel.

874
01:34:41,843 --> 01:34:44,220
You saw things you shouldn't have seen.

875
01:34:48,766 --> 01:34:50,268
What is Medellín?

876
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:52,478
Medellín?

877
01:34:57,358 --> 01:34:59,485
Medellín refers to a time

878
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:04,282
when one group controlled
every aspect of the drug trade,

879
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:08,703
providing a measure of order
that we could control.

880
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:15,543
And until somebody finds a way
to convince 20% of the population

881
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:18,129
to stop snorting and smoking that shit,

882
01:35:20,798 --> 01:35:22,634
order's the best we can hope for.

883
01:35:25,803 --> 01:35:27,889
And what you saw up there,

884
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:31,017
was Alejandro working toward
returning that order.

885
01:35:34,187 --> 01:35:37,649
Alejandro works for
the fucking Colombian Cartel.

886
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:43,571
He works for the competition.

887
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:46,366
Alejandro works for anyone

888
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:49,035
who will point him toward
the people who made him.

889
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,581
Us.

890
01:35:53,665 --> 01:35:54,666
Them.

891
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:58,002
Anyone who will turn him loose.

892
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:04,550
So, he can get the person
that cut off his wife's head,

893
01:36:06,386 --> 01:36:09,055
and threw his daughter into a vat of acid.

894
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:14,185
Yeah.

895
01:36:16,854 --> 01:36:18,856
That's what we're dealing with.

896
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:25,071
You can't do this.

897
01:36:27,532 --> 01:36:28,783
You can't.

898
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:35,123
I'm sure as shit not the person
you're gonna hide it all behind.

899
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:36,457
You need to just take a breath.

900
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:37,959
I'm gonna fuckin' talk.

901
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:39,961
- No, you're not.
- Yeah.

902
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:47,302
I'm gonna tell everyone what you did.

903
01:36:52,598 --> 01:36:54,475
That would be a major mistake.

904
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:22,462
Is that the target up ahead? Confirm.

905
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:28,843
<i>Roger that.
Black Mercedes, 60 meters ahead.</i>

906
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:32,388
Silvio...

907
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:53,493
This motherfucker...

908
01:42:00,031 --> 01:42:02,491
What happens when we get to the house?

909
01:42:02,575 --> 01:42:04,785
You'll stop the car, I'll get out.

910
01:42:07,204 --> 01:42:08,664
What will happen to me?

911
01:42:10,374 --> 01:42:11,459
Slow it down.

912
01:43:03,844 --> 01:43:04,929
<i>Six remain.</i>

913
01:43:06,806 --> 01:43:08,140
<i>We're going blind.</i>

914
01:44:30,347 --> 01:44:31,348
No.

915
01:44:56,373 --> 01:44:58,918
Every night you have families killed.

916
01:45:00,753 --> 01:45:03,589
And yet, here you dine.

917
01:45:06,217 --> 01:45:08,260
Tonight should be no different.

918
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:38,999
Do you think the people that sent you here

919
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:40,668
are any different?

920
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:46,674
Who do you think we learned it from?

921
01:45:53,013 --> 01:45:54,348
The grieving lawyer...

922
01:45:57,101 --> 01:46:01,605
Your wife, you think she'd be proud
of what you've become?

923
01:46:08,529 --> 01:46:10,364
Don't forget about my daughter.

924
01:46:43,314 --> 01:46:44,648
Not in front of my boys.

925
01:47:22,561 --> 01:47:24,188
Go ahead and finish your meal.

926
01:48:24,415 --> 01:48:27,751
I would recommend not standing
on balconies for a while, Kate.

927
01:48:58,991 --> 01:49:00,117
Sit down.

928
01:49:28,145 --> 01:49:30,647
You look like a little girl when you're scared.

929
01:49:51,919 --> 01:49:54,880
You remind me of the daughter
they took away from me.

930
01:50:15,901 --> 01:50:18,362
I need you to sign this piece of paper.

931
01:50:20,906 --> 01:50:23,742
It basically says that everything we did

932
01:50:25,035 --> 01:50:26,411
was done by the book.

933
01:50:47,975 --> 01:50:49,476
I can't sign that.

934
01:50:51,937 --> 01:50:52,980
Sign it.

935
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:21,800
It's okay.

936
01:51:24,303 --> 01:51:25,804
I can't sign that.

937
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:37,608
God!

938
01:51:39,943 --> 01:51:42,446
You would be committing suicide, Kate.

939
01:52:03,717 --> 01:52:05,719
Come on. Sign it.

940
01:52:30,077 --> 01:52:31,912
You should move to a small town,

941
01:52:34,164 --> 01:52:35,999
where the rule of law still exists.

942
01:52:38,335 --> 01:52:40,045
You will not survive here.

943
01:52:42,214 --> 01:52:43,674
You are not a wolf.

944
01:52:44,508 --> 01:52:46,385
And this is the land of wolves now.
