00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,662
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

2
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,709
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

3
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,439
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

4
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,610
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

5
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,489
<i>Lumos Maxima!</i>

6
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:42,478
Harry. Harry.

7
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:44,647
Harry, open the door.

8
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,359
Uh...

9
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,613
Marge. How lovely to see--

10
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:57,451
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.

11
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:58,953
What is it?

12
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,247
Nothing. School stuff.

13
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:04,083
Later perhaps, if you behave.

14
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,460
I will if she does.

15
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,755
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.

16
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,800
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

17
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,927
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

18
00:02:15,094 --> 00:02:18,472
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

19
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,978
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

20
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:25,938
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

21
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:28,399
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

22
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,526
Okay.

23
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,782
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

24
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,745
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.

25
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,914
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

26
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,500
A bit more.

27
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:50,338
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 12 dogs.

28
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:53,132
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

29
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:58,220
Ah! You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

30
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:02,433
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

31
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,728
What are you smirking at?

32
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:07,730
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?

33
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,233
St. Brutus'. It's a fine institution
for hopeless cases.

34
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,403
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus', boy?

35
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,200
Oh, yeah.

36
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,078
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.

37
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,830
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...

38
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,167
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

39
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:31,462
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

40
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:35,549
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

41
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,885
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?

42
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:41,055
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

43
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:44,058
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.

44
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,769
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.

45
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:53,859
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.

46
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,861
I think it's time you went to bed.

47
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:59,281
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

48
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:03,661
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.

49
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:07,623
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

50
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,836
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.

51
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,712
Shut up! Shut up!

52
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:22,763
Right. Let me tell you...

53
00:04:36,152 --> 00:04:38,112
Oh...

54
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,328
Vernon!

55
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:51,167
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

56
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,881
Ow! Ripper! Ow...

57
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:36,629
Stop!

58
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:41,759
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.

59
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:47,181
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.

60
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:50,267
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.

61
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:53,312
Oh, Vernon.

62
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:55,231
Oh, God.

63
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,191
Marge!

64
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,450
Please!

65
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:09,286
Marge!

66
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:13,541
Come back!

67
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,942
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

68
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:42,528
- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.

69
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,949
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.

70
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,160
- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.

71
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,662
You've nowhere to go.

72
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:54,164
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

73
00:06:54,164 --> 00:07:24,164

00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,137
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...

My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be

77
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,984
What you doing down there?

78
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,904
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?

79
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:51,782
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.

80
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,159
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

- Nothing.

00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,255
Well, come on, then. In.

83
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:09,591
No, no, no. I'll get this.
You get in.

84
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:16,432
Come on.

85
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,069
Come on. Move on, move on.

86
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:47,087
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

87
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,506
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

88
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:03,479
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.

89
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:08,150
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

90
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,278
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."

91
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,781
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...

92
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,158
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.

93
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,790
- The Muggles. Can't they see us?
- Muggles?

94
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,708
They don't see nothing, do they?

95
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,419
if you jab them with a fork, they feel.

96
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:32,216
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

97
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,519
Ten, nine, eight...

98
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,438
...seven, six, five...

99
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,899
...four, three, three and a half...

100
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,901
...two, one and three quarters.

101
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,070
Yes!

102
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,993
Who is that? That man.

103
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:04,832
Who is that?

104
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,542
Who is--?

105
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,127
That is Sirius Black, that is.

106
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,965
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

107
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,552
He's a murderer.

108
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,346
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

109
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,433
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?

110
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,561
He's the first one that done it.

111
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,147
He was a big supporter of...

112
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,149
...You-Know-Who.

113
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,735
I reckon you've heard of him.

114
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,487
Yeah.

115
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:36,989
Him I've heard of.

116
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,327
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.

117
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:44,496
They're getting closer, Ernie.

118
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:47,541
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

119
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,009
Mind your head.

120
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,809
Hey, guys? Guys?
Why the long faces?

121
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,818
Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.

122
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:21,658
The Leaky Cauldron.

123
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,660
Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

124
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:27,664
Ah. Mr. Potter, at last.

125
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,378
- Take it away, Ern.
- Take it away!

126
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,403
Room 11.

127
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,324
Hedwig.

128
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:05,327
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

129
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:08,830
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

130
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,753
As Minister for Magic,
it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter...

131
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,131
...earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...

132
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:22,260
...a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

133
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:26,181
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

134
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:31,144
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

135
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:36,024
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

136
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,777
So that's that...

137
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,071
...and no harm done.

138
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,824
Pea soup?

139
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,118
No, thank you.

140
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,495
- Minister?
- Yes?

141
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,414
- I don't understand.
- Understand?

142
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:54,167
I broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.

143
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:57,379
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...

144
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,089
...for blowing up their aunts.

145
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:08,598
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...

146
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,226
...was very, very irresponsible.

147
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:15,230
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.

148
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,232
Sirius Black, you mean?

149
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,151
But what's he got to do with me?

150
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:26,283
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

151
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,619
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

152
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,748
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...

153
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:36,918
...of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

154
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,050
Hedwig.

155
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:48,305
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...

156
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,599
...wander.

157
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,520
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

158
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,351
Housekeeping.

159
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,023
I'll come back later.

160
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,032
I'm warning you, Hermione.

161
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,911
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

162
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,247
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?

163
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,333
- It's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?

164
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,044
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...

165
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,755
...coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

166
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,341
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.

167
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,135
Harry.

168
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,637
Harry.

169
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,892
- Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

170
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,437
...like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

171
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,815
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.

172
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:07,152
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.

173
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,738
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

174
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:11,406
- The day maid.
- Night maid.

175
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,617
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.

176
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,452
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

177
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,537
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.

178
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,039
- Got everything?
- Yes.

179
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:21,374
- Yes? All your books?
- It's all upstairs.

180
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,959
- Your clothes?
- Everything.

181
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,169
- Good boy.
- Thank you.

182
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,588
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.

183
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:30,258
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

184
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,094
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

185
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,890
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.

186
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,813
Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...

187
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,650
...from divulging what I'm about
to reveal to you.

188
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:50,153
But I think that you need
to know the facts.

189
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,906
You are in danger.

190
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,034
Grave danger.

191
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,162
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

192
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,374
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

193
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,253
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?

194
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:09,756
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...

195
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,758
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.

196
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,260
Sorry.

197
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,346
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

198
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,139
...Black lost everything.

199
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:22,602
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.

200
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,938
And in his mind...

201
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:28,108
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

202
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:32,028
...of You-Know-Who
returning to power.

203
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,364
And that is why...

204
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:37,075
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

205
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:39,119
To find you.

206
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,205
And kill me.

207
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,834
Harry, swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

208
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:48,545
...you won't go looking for Black.

209
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,255
Mr. Weasley...

210
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:54,426
...why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

211
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:56,845
Quick. Quick.

212
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,972
Ron, Ron!

213
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,766
Oh, for goodness' sake!

214
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,436
Don't lose him!

215
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,564
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just--

216
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:10,191
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.

217
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,945
Honestly, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

218
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,864
I was lucky not to be arrested.

219
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:18,074
I still think it was brilliant.

220
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,994
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

221
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,206
Who do you think that is?

222
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,251
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?

223
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,545
How is it she knows everything?

224
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:33,840
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.

225
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:37,427
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be. Why?

226
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,264
I gotta tell you something.

227
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:57,822
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

228
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,824
- ...to come after you?
- Yeah.

229
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,993
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

230
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,871
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.

231
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,375
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...

232
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:12,003
- ...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.

233
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,632
Why are we stopping?

234
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,426
We can't be there yet.

235
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,891
What's going on?

236
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,769
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

237
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:32,023
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

238
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,818
There's something moving out there.

239
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:51,459
I think someone's coming aboard.

240
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:19,529
Bloody hell! What's happening?

241
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,228
Harry.

242
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,147
Harry, are you all right?

243
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,988
Thank you.

244
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,617
Here, eat this. It'll help.

245
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,245
It's all right. It's chocolate.

246
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,628
What was that thing that came?

247
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:02,215
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's gone now.

248
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:05,093
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

249
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,888
If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.

250
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:16,396
Eat. You'll feel better.

251
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,528
What happened to me?

252
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:25,446
Well, you sort of went rigid.

253
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:28,783
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

254
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,328
And did either of you two...

255
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:33,830
...you know...

256
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:37,083
- ...pass out?
- No.

257
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,960
I felt weird, though.

258
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,962
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

259
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,424
But someone was screaming.

260
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:45,967
A woman.

261
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,720
No one was screaming, Harry.

262
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:51,866
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

263
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:54,118
Now, I'd like to say a few words...

264
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:58,623
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

265
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:02,043
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...

266
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,671
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

267
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:07,340
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

268
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:10,051
Good luck, professor.

269
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:17,475
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

270
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:20,812
Potter. Potter. Is it true you fainted?

271
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:24,649
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.

272
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:26,818
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.

273
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,362
Our Care of
Magical Creatures teacher...

274
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,447
...has decided to retire...

275
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:35,368
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

276
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:38,287
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...

277
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:41,290
...that his place will be taken
by none other...

278
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:45,795
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

279
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,851
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

280
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,562
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

281
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:07,942
...Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

282
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,487
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

283
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,701
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

284
00:26:16,868 --> 00:26:18,536
Now whilst I've been assured...

285
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:22,373
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

286
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,875
...a word of caution.

287
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:27,253
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...

288
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,840
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

289
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:34,635
Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...

290
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:38,431
...to give them no reason
to harm you.

291
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:44,312
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

292
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:49,734
But you know,
happiness can be found...

293
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:53,529
...even in the darkest of times...

294
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:58,618
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

295
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,632
<i>Fortuna Major.</i>

296
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:18,137
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.

297
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:21,265
- <i>Fortuna Major.</i>
- No, no. Wait, wait.

298
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:23,267
Watch this.

299
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:38,991
- Amazing. Just with my voice.
- <i>Fortuna Major.</i>

300
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,745
- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.

301
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,749
Still doing that after three years.

302
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,085
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.

303
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,921
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

304
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,882
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.

305
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,635
Green. That's a monkey.

306
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:02,473
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?

307
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,851
Do not give him one again.

308
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,645
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

309
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,487
- Ron, catch.
- I will.

310
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,786
I think we have a winner.

311
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:27,081
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.

312
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:30,209
Look at him. His face.

313
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:16,088
<i>Welcome, my children.</i>

314
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:21,385
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

315
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:26,849
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

316
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:32,229
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

317
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:37,026
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

318
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:41,072
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
the art of reading tea leaves.

319
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:44,825
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

320
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,702
What do you see?

321
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:52,541
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.

322
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,169
But first, you must broaden
your minds.

323
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:59,882
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.

324
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:01,968
- Where did you come from?
- Me?

325
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,804
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...

326
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:07,264
Is your grandmother quite well?

327
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:09,392
I think so.

328
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,353
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

329
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:16,732
Pity.

330
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:19,568
Broaden your minds.

331
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:26,492
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

332
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,577
- I think you are.
- Sure.

333
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:30,997
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

334
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,457
Yeah. Um, well...

335
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:38,129
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

336
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:42,216
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.

337
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:43,759
So...

338
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:47,972
...you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

339
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,515
Give me the cup.

340
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:53,978
Oh, my dear boy.

341
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,732
My dear...

342
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,486
...you have the Grim.

343
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,072
The Grin? What's the Grin?

344
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:08,117
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

345
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:10,453
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

346
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:13,122
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.

347
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,332
It's an omen...

348
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,334
...of death."

349
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,676
You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?

350
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:29,805
Honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.

351
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:33,642
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.

352
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:36,937
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?

353
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:38,773
A fair few.

354
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,025
Hang on. That's not possible.

355
00:31:41,192 --> 00:31:43,986
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

356
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:46,155
You have to be in two
classes at once.

357
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:49,700
Don't be silly. How could
anyone be in two classes at once?

358
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:53,913
"Broaden your minds. Use your
inner Eye to see the future."

359
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:59,251
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.

360
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:01,253
I got a real treat for you today.

361
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,422
A great lesson. So follow me.

362
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:17,770
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

363
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:20,439
And open your books to page 49.

364
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,233
Exactly how do we do that?

365
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:26,320
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

366
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:39,500
- Don't be such a wimp.
- I'm okay. Okay.

367
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,382
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

368
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,051
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.

369
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,513
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.

370
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,224
Shut up, Malfoy.

371
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:59,019
Ooh...

372
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,283
Dementor! Dementor!

373
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,877
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.

374
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,503
Yeah.

375
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:29,508
Tah-tah-dah-dah!

376
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:37,725
Isn't he beautiful?

377
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:40,519
Say hello to Buckbeak.

378
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:43,355
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

379
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:45,608
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

380
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:49,278
First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.

381
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:53,365
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

382
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:56,285
It may be the last thing you ever do.

383
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:59,830
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?

384
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,460
Well done, Harry. Well done.

385
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:08,631
Come on now.

386
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:10,507
Now...

387
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:14,428
...you have to let him make the first
move. It's only polite. So...

388
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:16,472
...step up. Give him a nice bow.

389
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,099
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

390
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:21,393
If he does, you can go and touch him.

391
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,772
If not-- Well,
we'll get to that later.

392
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:29,485
Just make your bow.

393
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,738
Nice and low.

394
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:39,745
Back off, Harry. Back off.

395
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:43,123
Keep still.

396
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,794
Keep still.

397
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:59,390
Oh, well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

398
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,436
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.

399
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:06,480
Go on. Don't be shy.

400
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,944
Ow!

401
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,366
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

402
00:35:20,703 --> 00:35:22,121
Not so fast, Harry.

403
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:30,462
Slow down, Harry. That's it...

404
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:33,841
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

405
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:38,053
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...

406
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:40,055
That's it...

407
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,016
Yes!

408
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,020
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

409
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,188
Does he get to fly?

410
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:50,774
- He may let you ride him now.
- What?

411
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:53,110
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!

412
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:55,863
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

413
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:00,909
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

414
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:09,418
Whoa!

415
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:06,475
Ha! Whoo-hoo!

416
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:45,347
Well done, Harry,
and well done, Buckbeak.

417
00:37:45,556 --> 00:37:47,474
That was wicked, Harry!

418
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:49,059
Oh, please.

419
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:52,187
Well done, well done.

420
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:56,066
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.

421
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:03,699
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!

422
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:04,950
Malfoy, no...

423
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,203
- No!
- Ow!

424
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,997
Buckbeak!

425
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,332
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

426
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,294
Whoa! Buckbeak!

427
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,755
Away, you silly creature...

428
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:22,050
- It's killed me! It's killed me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!

429
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:23,469
Hagrid!

430
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:27,681
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

431
00:38:31,894 --> 00:38:34,771
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!

432
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:37,232
You and your bloody chicken!

433
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:02,758
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

434
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:06,803
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.

435
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:10,307
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.

436
00:39:10,641 --> 00:39:13,519
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.

437
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:18,023
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

438
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:21,944
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

439
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,987
- He's been sighted!
- Who?

440
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:25,906
Sirius Black!

441
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:29,952
Duff town? That's not far from here.

442
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:32,996
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?

443
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,666
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?

444
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:39,169
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

445
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:43,924
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.

446
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,886
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

447
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:16,081
intriguing, isn't it?

448
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,087
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...

449
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:24,047
...as to what is inside?

450
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:27,634
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.

451
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:31,930
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

452
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,182
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?

453
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:35,892
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

454
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:39,313
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.

455
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:43,942
- That's what makes them so--
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...

456
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:49,615
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

457
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:54,745
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

458
00:40:55,037 --> 00:40:57,539
After me. <i>Riddikulus!</i>

459
00:40:57,748 --> 00:40:59,875
<i>- Riddikulus!</i>
- Very good.

460
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,586
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:

461
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,005
<i>-Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!</i>

462
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,299
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.

463
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:11,511
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.

464
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:15,432
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

465
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:20,062
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

466
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:24,358
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?

467
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:26,902
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

468
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:29,571
Come on.

469
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:33,533
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?

470
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:35,410
Professor Snape.

471
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:37,454
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.

472
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:41,041
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

473
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:45,712
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.

474
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:47,798
No...

475
00:41:48,632 --> 00:41:51,426
...it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.

476
00:41:51,677 --> 00:41:54,888
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

477
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:58,183
- She carries a red handbag--
- We don't need to hear.

478
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:02,229
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...

479
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:05,732
...here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.

480
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:09,111
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

481
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:11,029
Can you do that?

482
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:14,324
Yes. Wand at the ready.

483
00:42:14,658 --> 00:42:18,161
One, two, three.

484
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:29,840
Think, Neville, think.

485
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:34,636
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

486
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:41,852
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...

487
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,980
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...

488
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,529
Form a line!

489
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:56,116
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

490
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:59,411
...and turn it into something funny.

491
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,329
Next! Ron!

492
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:08,086
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

493
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:21,099
Wand at the ready, Ron.

494
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:22,893
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

495
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:28,690
Yes! You see? Very good, very good!

496
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:35,030
Marvelous! Absolutely, very,
very enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

497
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:39,034
Show us what you see.

498
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:51,713
Keep your nerve. Steady.

499
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,840
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

500
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:56,843
And next! Step up, step up!

501
00:43:57,928 --> 00:43:59,763
Wonderful, wonderful!

502
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:15,904
Here!

503
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:23,578
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

504
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:35,006
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

505
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:37,175
Collect your books from the back.

506
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:39,970
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

507
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:43,181
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.

508
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:49,771
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

509
00:44:50,063 --> 00:44:52,899
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school...

510
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:55,986
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.

511
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,739
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

512
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:01,449
That's the rule, Potter.

513
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:04,870
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

514
00:45:05,036 --> 00:45:07,539
I thought if you signed it,
then I could--

515
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:10,208
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

516
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:13,587
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

517
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:20,468
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.

518
00:45:21,678 --> 00:45:24,931
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

519
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:40,780
Professor, can I ask you something?

520
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:44,826
You want to know why I stopped
you facing that boggart, yes?

521
00:45:45,035 --> 00:45:46,453
I thought it'd be obvious.

522
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,456
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

523
00:45:49,623 --> 00:45:53,126
I did think of Voldemort at first.

524
00:45:53,335 --> 00:45:55,962
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

525
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:58,673
- ...and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.

526
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,718
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

527
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:03,386
This is very wise.

528
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:05,639
Before I fainted...

529
00:46:05,889 --> 00:46:07,891
...I heard something.

530
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:10,060
A woman...

531
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:11,853
...screaming.

532
00:46:12,062 --> 00:46:15,315
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

533
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:18,443
Our pain becomes their power.

534
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:21,488
I think it was my mother...

535
00:46:21,655 --> 00:46:23,865
...the night she was murdered.

536
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:29,955
The very first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.

537
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:33,375
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

538
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:35,961
They're your mother, Lily's.

539
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,338
Yes.

540
00:46:38,672 --> 00:46:41,675
Oh, yes. I knew her.

541
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,847
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

542
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:51,267
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

543
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:54,771
...she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

544
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:58,358
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...

545
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:04,698
...even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.

546
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,868
And your father, James,
on the other hand...

547
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,578
...he...

548
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:14,416
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

549
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:22,215
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

550
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:29,180
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

551
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:33,143
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.

552
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:40,984
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

553
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:43,737
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.

554
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:47,949
- You heard it's the most--
- Haunted building in Britain.

555
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:50,827
What's going on?

556
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:53,455
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

557
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,041
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.

558
00:47:56,207 --> 00:48:00,503
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

559
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,798
Get back, all of you.

560
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:07,135
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.

561
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:08,636
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

562
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:13,183
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

563
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:14,684
It's not funny, Ron.

564
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:19,272
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.

565
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:21,357
Back to your common room.

566
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:30,909
- Be quiet. The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.

567
00:48:31,117 --> 00:48:32,994
You heard. Move!

568
00:48:47,217 --> 00:48:50,095
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

569
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:54,516
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

570
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:57,811
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

571
00:48:58,645 --> 00:48:59,938
The Fat Lady's there.

572
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:03,608
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

573
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:06,861
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

574
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:09,447
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!

575
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:15,912
Dear lady, who did this to you?

576
00:49:17,831 --> 00:49:22,877
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.

577
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:26,798
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

578
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:30,593
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!

579
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:37,183
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

580
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:10,175
I searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

581
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:12,927
- Thank you.
- The floor's clear.

582
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:15,263
- Good.
- I've done the dungeons.

583
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,891
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.

584
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:20,602
I didn't really expect him to linger.

585
00:50:21,853 --> 00:50:24,189
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

586
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,649
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...

587
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:29,485
- ...completely undetected?
- Quite remarkable.

588
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:31,529
Any theories on how he managed it?

589
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:34,699
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

590
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,492
You may recall...

591
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:39,495
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...

592
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:41,748
...about your appointment
of Professor--

593
00:50:41,915 --> 00:50:46,002
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.

594
00:50:46,169 --> 00:50:48,588
I'm quite convinced
the castle is safe...

595
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:52,383
...and I'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.

596
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,886
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

597
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,722
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

598
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:03,311
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

599
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:10,109
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

600
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:50,775
Turn to page 394.

601
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:03,788
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

602
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:07,917
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

603
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:11,963
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

604
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:17,218
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

605
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,725
"Werewolves"?

606
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,811
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

607
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:30,189
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.

608
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:33,568
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

609
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:37,697
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...

610
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:40,325
...between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

611
00:52:41,034 --> 00:52:42,952
No one?

612
00:52:43,453 --> 00:52:46,372
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.

613
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:49,751
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

614
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,461
A werewolf has no choice.

615
00:52:51,878 --> 00:52:53,588
With each full moon...

616
00:52:53,755 --> 00:52:57,633
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.

617
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:00,720
The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

618
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:05,350
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...

619
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,852
...you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.

620
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:10,021
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

621
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:13,524
...or do you take pride in being
an insufferable know-it-all?

622
00:53:13,816 --> 00:53:17,236
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.

623
00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:22,033
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

624
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:25,953
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...

625
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,706
- ...on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.

626
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:33,127
Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

627
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:37,382
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

628
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:41,344
Page 394.

629
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:44,806
The term "werewolf"...

630
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:50,228
...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word <i>"wer"...</i>

631
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:55,400
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.

632
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:58,403
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

633
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:01,614
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

634
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:03,783
...being bitten by a werewolf...

635
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:26,222
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

636
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:28,844
<i>Aresto momentum!</i>

637
00:56:31,097 --> 00:56:34,225
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?

638
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:36,686
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.

639
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:39,730
Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.

640
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:42,984
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

641
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:49,615
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.

642
00:56:49,824 --> 00:56:51,784
You gave us a right good scare.

643
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:55,538
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.

644
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:58,165
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

645
00:57:00,835 --> 00:57:04,297
Um, no one blames you, Harry.

646
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:08,342
Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

647
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:10,636
After he saved you,
he sent them off.

648
00:57:10,803 --> 00:57:14,473
There's something else
you should know too.

649
00:57:15,016 --> 00:57:21,355
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and...

650
00:57:21,856 --> 00:57:23,357
Well...

651
00:57:24,609 --> 00:57:26,694
<i>I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.</i>

652
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:29,864
Is there no chance of fixing it?

653
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:31,407
No.

654
00:57:31,574 --> 00:57:34,910
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?

655
00:57:35,328 --> 00:57:38,414
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.

656
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:41,751
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.

657
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:46,213
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...

658
00:57:46,756 --> 00:57:51,344
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

659
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:55,765
You are not weak, Harry.

660
00:57:55,931 --> 00:58:00,019
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.

661
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:03,314
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

662
00:58:03,773 --> 00:58:06,067
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

663
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:10,321
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

664
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:13,991
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

665
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:16,160
You made the one
on the train go away.

666
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:18,120
There was only one that night.

667
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:23,000
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

668
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:28,297
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you...

669
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:32,134
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.

670
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:34,220
For now, I need to rest.

671
00:58:59,662 --> 00:59:03,958
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

672
00:59:19,557 --> 00:59:21,559
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.

673
00:59:21,726 --> 00:59:24,645
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.

674
00:59:24,812 --> 00:59:27,648
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.

675
00:59:27,815 --> 00:59:28,941
We'll get you there.

676
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:31,902
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- If you pipe down.

677
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:35,656
- Bless him.
- Let me go! Come on. Don't--

678
00:59:36,282 --> 00:59:38,868
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.

679
00:59:40,286 --> 00:59:42,413
- What are you doing?!
- Shh!

680
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:45,499
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.

681
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:49,003
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you--

682
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:52,089
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

683
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:54,008
George, if you will.

684
00:59:54,175 --> 00:59:57,470
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.

685
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:04,685
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail,
Padfoot and Prongs...

686
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:08,063
...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map."

687
01:00:08,314 --> 01:00:10,566
We owe them so much.

688
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:17,948
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that--

689
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,576
- No. Is that really--?
- Dumbledore.

690
01:00:20,743 --> 01:00:22,077
- In his study.
- Pacing.

691
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,205
Does that a lot.

692
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:25,581
So this map shows--

693
01:00:25,748 --> 01:00:26,874
- Everyone.
- Everyone?

694
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:28,459
- Where they are.
- What they do.

695
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:29,752
- Every minute.
- Every day.

696
01:00:29,919 --> 01:00:32,922
- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.

697
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:35,841
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways...

698
01:00:36,008 --> 01:00:38,677
- ...out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.

699
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:42,014
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.

700
01:00:42,181 --> 01:00:44,016
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

701
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:47,603
And don't forget. When you're done,
just give it a tap and say:

702
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:52,107
"Mischief managed."
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

703
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,645
Now, how much do you want?

704
01:01:36,944 --> 01:01:38,863
Delicious.

705
01:01:46,871 --> 01:01:49,915
It's meant to be
the most haunted building in Britain.

706
01:01:50,082 --> 01:01:52,501
- Did I mention that?
- Twice.

707
01:01:52,668 --> 01:01:55,838
- Oh. Do you want to move a bit closer?
- Huh?

708
01:01:56,046 --> 01:02:00,926
- To the Shrieking Shack?
- Oh. Actually, I'm fine here.

709
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:02,928
Well, well. Look who's here.

710
01:02:03,304 --> 01:02:05,598
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

711
01:02:05,806 --> 01:02:10,102
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

712
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:13,522
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.

713
01:02:13,814 --> 01:02:17,776
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

714
01:02:19,153 --> 01:02:22,573
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!

715
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,742
You filthy little mudblood!

716
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,497
Who is that?

717
01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:39,089
- Don't stand there! Do something!
- What?

718
01:02:58,901 --> 01:03:01,195
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

719
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:06,575
Get out of the way!

720
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:08,369
Move!

721
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:11,830
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

722
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:17,544
Harry!

723
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:21,757
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

724
01:03:22,925 --> 01:03:26,178
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.

725
01:03:26,387 --> 01:03:29,807
He won't keep it.
He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.

726
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:31,225
Aren't you?

727
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:34,019
Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

728
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:36,689
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

729
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:39,191
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!

730
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:41,235
- McGonagall!
- Cornelius!

731
01:03:41,402 --> 01:03:42,778
Allow me, minister.

732
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:44,822
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry.

733
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,950
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.

734
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:52,037
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...

735
01:03:52,204 --> 01:03:56,250
- ...into my pub every other night!
- We have...

736
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:59,878
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

737
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:02,673
And what would bring him here?

738
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,843
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?

739
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:08,262
- Shh!
- Come.

740
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:13,475
Harry!

741
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:25,654
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!

742
01:04:25,863 --> 01:04:27,698
- So rude.
- Thick heads.

743
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:30,367
- Thick?!
- How dare they!

744
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:33,287
- Who are they calling that?
- Whippersnappers!

745
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:37,750
Nobody will come to a pub
where they'll get scared out of their wits.

746
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:41,086
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.

747
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:46,425
Tell me what this is all about.

748
01:04:46,592 --> 01:04:51,055
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death--

749
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:53,891
Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.

750
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:57,936
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

751
01:04:58,145 --> 01:05:01,356
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...

752
01:05:01,523 --> 01:05:04,902
...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!

753
01:05:05,152 --> 01:05:07,321
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

754
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:09,573
- Trailing after Black.
- I remember.

755
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,742
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

756
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:14,661
- What happened?
- He tried to warn them...

757
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:18,999
...and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

758
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:23,045
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.

759
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:25,422
He destroyed him!

760
01:05:26,048 --> 01:05:30,803
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

761
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:34,014
Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...

762
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:37,392
- ...but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.

763
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:40,437
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst.

764
01:05:40,646 --> 01:05:44,399
- What could be worse?
- This: Sirius Black was...

765
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:46,735
...and remains to this day...

766
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:48,821
...Harry Potter's godfather!

767
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,748
Ron, look!

768
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:08,048
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.

769
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:48,338
Harry, what happened?

770
01:06:50,841 --> 01:06:52,968
He was their friend...

771
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:55,721
...and he betrayed them.

772
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:58,473
He was their friend!

773
01:07:00,726 --> 01:07:02,686
I hope he finds me.

774
01:07:03,312 --> 01:07:05,647
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!

775
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:08,734
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

776
01:07:22,998 --> 01:07:24,625
<i>Harry.</i>

777
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:26,793
<i>There you are. You came.</i>

778
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:31,048
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic...

779
01:07:31,215 --> 01:07:33,675
...well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.

780
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:35,385
I'm sure.

781
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:38,430
Well, everything's prepared.

782
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:42,059
The spell I'm going to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

783
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:43,727
Did you ever hear of it?

784
01:07:43,894 --> 01:07:45,562
No? Well...

785
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:49,316
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...

786
01:07:49,483 --> 01:07:54,154
...it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.

787
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:58,158
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.

788
01:07:58,325 --> 01:08:02,287
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.

789
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:06,291
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.

790
01:08:07,501 --> 01:08:09,711
Close your eyes.

791
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:13,382
Concentrate.

792
01:08:14,633 --> 01:08:16,718
Explore your past.

793
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:19,096
Do you have a memory?

794
01:08:20,681 --> 01:08:22,891
Allow it to fill you up.

795
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,686
Lose yourself within it.

796
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:31,358
Then speak the incantation,
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

797
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:34,611
- <i>Expecto Patronum.</i>
- Very good.

798
01:08:38,407 --> 01:08:41,743
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

799
01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:02,180
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

800
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:06,310
<i>Expecto... Expecto...</i>

801
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,270
<i>Expect...</i>

802
01:09:10,272 --> 01:09:14,359
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.

803
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:18,447
It's all right. I didn't expect you
to do it the first time.

804
01:09:18,864 --> 01:09:23,994
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

805
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:27,706
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.

806
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:30,667
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.

807
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:34,004
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.

808
01:09:34,171 --> 01:09:36,798
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?

809
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:40,677
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.

810
01:09:41,887 --> 01:09:45,223
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

811
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:57,361
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.

812
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:01,406
Well, it is.

813
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:04,159
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

814
01:10:04,326 --> 01:10:08,288
- ...but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?

815
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:15,504
Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?

816
01:10:17,297 --> 01:10:19,049
Just do it.

817
01:10:29,101 --> 01:10:32,354
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

818
01:10:33,605 --> 01:10:37,567
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

819
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:00,257
Yes!

820
01:11:02,217 --> 01:11:05,637
Well done, Harry. Well done!

821
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:10,308
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes. Sit down. Here.

822
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:12,894
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

823
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:14,855
And just so you know, Harry...

824
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:17,732
...I think you'd have given your father
a run for his money.

825
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:21,236
And that is saying something.

826
01:11:23,405 --> 01:11:25,407
I was thinking of him.

827
01:11:25,574 --> 01:11:27,742
And Mum.

828
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:30,162
Seeing their faces.

829
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:33,498
They were talking to me.

830
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:35,917
Just talking.

831
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:38,420
That's the memory I chose.

832
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,507
I don't even know if it's real.

833
01:11:43,008 --> 01:11:45,177
But it's the best I have.

834
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:56,730
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.

835
01:11:56,897 --> 01:11:58,899
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!

836
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:01,485
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

837
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:04,821
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!

838
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:07,115
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.

839
01:12:07,282 --> 01:12:10,619
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

840
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:14,706
...is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.

841
01:12:14,873 --> 01:12:17,751
Well, maybe you should
take better care of your pets!

842
01:12:17,918 --> 01:12:20,003
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.

843
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:21,671
- Did.
- Didn't.

844
01:12:23,715 --> 01:12:26,343
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

845
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:29,804
Well, first off, the committee members
took turns...

846
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:32,641
...talking about why we were there.

847
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:37,187
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...

848
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:40,315
...was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.

849
01:12:40,524 --> 01:12:43,568
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.

850
01:12:43,735 --> 01:12:46,947
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...

851
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:50,158
...who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

852
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:52,160
And then?

853
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:55,580
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.

854
01:12:55,747 --> 01:12:59,876
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.

855
01:13:01,962 --> 01:13:04,965
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

856
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:37,372
Spiders! There's-- There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

857
01:13:37,581 --> 01:13:40,125
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.

858
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:44,296
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...

859
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:04,816
<i>- Peter Pettigrew?</i>
<i>- Lump of a boy.</i>

860
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:07,902
- <i>Always trailing after Sirius Black.</i>
<i>- Black was vicious.</i>

861
01:14:08,111 --> 01:14:10,572
<i>He didn't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!</i>

862
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:22,125
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.

863
01:15:05,377 --> 01:15:07,796
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!

864
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:09,589
Yes, we are.

865
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:20,308
Mischief managed. <i>Nox.</i>

866
01:15:22,519 --> 01:15:23,853
Potter.

867
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:27,524
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?

868
01:15:27,691 --> 01:15:28,858
I was sleepwalking.

869
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:31,569
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.

870
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:36,491
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.

871
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:41,037
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.

872
01:15:41,788 --> 01:15:44,874
If you don't mind, I would appreciate it
if you could lower your wand.

873
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:50,255
Turn out your pockets.

874
01:15:51,923 --> 01:15:54,551
Turn out your pockets!

875
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:59,097
What's this?

876
01:15:59,264 --> 01:16:02,517
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really? Open it.

877
01:16:09,023 --> 01:16:12,777
Reveal your secrets.

878
01:16:16,573 --> 01:16:18,032
Read it.

879
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:25,999
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...

880
01:16:26,166 --> 01:16:30,295
...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and..."

881
01:16:30,587 --> 01:16:32,088
Go on.

882
01:16:33,256 --> 01:16:37,135
"And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business."

883
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:39,888
- You insolent little--
- Professor!

884
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:44,225
Well, well. Lupin.

885
01:16:44,392 --> 01:16:49,105
Out for a little walk
in the moonlight, are we?

886
01:16:50,482 --> 01:16:52,901
Harry, are you all right?

887
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:55,570
That remains to be seen.

888
01:16:56,404 --> 01:17:00,158
I have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.

889
01:17:00,325 --> 01:17:03,870
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.

890
01:17:04,037 --> 01:17:08,833
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.

891
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,504
It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...

892
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:16,549
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.

893
01:17:16,716 --> 01:17:20,970
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

894
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:24,265
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.

895
01:17:24,432 --> 01:17:27,769
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.

896
01:17:33,775 --> 01:17:36,528
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

897
01:17:41,616 --> 01:17:43,076
Come in.

898
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:50,083
I haven't the faintest idea how this map
came to be in your possession...

899
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:54,754
...but quite frankly, I am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

900
01:17:54,921 --> 01:17:58,591
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...

901
01:17:58,758 --> 01:18:00,760
...is a map to you?

902
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:04,055
- No.
- No, sir.

903
01:18:06,057 --> 01:18:09,102
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.

904
01:18:09,269 --> 01:18:13,606
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

905
01:18:14,232 --> 01:18:18,319
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering the castle unprotected...

906
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:22,949
...with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!

907
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:25,326
Now, I will not cover up for you again.

908
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:27,954
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

909
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:31,791
I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.

910
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:36,713
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.

911
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:45,805
Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.

912
01:18:46,681 --> 01:18:51,644
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.

913
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,814
Oh, really? And who might that be?

914
01:18:54,981 --> 01:18:56,524
Peter Pettigrew.

915
01:18:59,152 --> 01:19:01,237
That's not possible.

916
01:19:02,447 --> 01:19:04,115
It's just what I saw.

917
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:08,661
Good night, professor.

918
01:19:12,165 --> 01:19:16,336
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

919
01:19:16,502 --> 01:19:21,341
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.

920
01:19:22,717 --> 01:19:25,428
Only then can you see. Try again.

921
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:28,056
Now, what do we have here?

922
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:32,602
- Oh. Do you mind me trying?
- Ah...

923
01:19:35,021 --> 01:19:37,982
The Grim, possibly.

924
01:19:40,151 --> 01:19:44,238
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...

925
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:48,201
...I sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...

926
01:19:48,368 --> 01:19:52,288
...for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.

927
01:19:52,455 --> 01:19:56,125
You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled...

928
01:19:56,292 --> 01:20:00,296
...as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...

929
01:20:00,463 --> 01:20:03,591
...to which you so desperately cleave.

930
01:20:19,107 --> 01:20:21,109
Have I said something?

931
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:30,785
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...

932
01:20:30,952 --> 01:20:33,538
...but now it's in the open
for everyone to see.

933
01:20:33,705 --> 01:20:35,873
Hang on.

934
01:20:36,082 --> 01:20:38,960
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.

935
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:42,714
- Fine. See you later.
- See you.

936
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:25,757
<i>Harry Potter...</i>

937
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:36,893
- Professor Trelawney--
- He will return tonight.

938
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,686
Sorry?

939
01:21:38,895 --> 01:21:43,524
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...

940
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:45,735
...shall break free.

941
01:21:45,902 --> 01:21:48,154
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

942
01:21:48,321 --> 01:21:54,327
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

943
01:21:59,707 --> 01:22:03,920
Oh, I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?

944
01:22:04,712 --> 01:22:06,506
No.

945
01:22:06,964 --> 01:22:08,508
Nothing.

946
01:23:01,102 --> 01:23:05,148
I can't believe they're going
to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

947
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:08,067
- It just got worse.
- What did I say? Father said...

948
01:23:08,234 --> 01:23:12,405
...I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

949
01:23:12,572 --> 01:23:15,032
This is going to be rich.

950
01:23:15,241 --> 01:23:17,410
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?

951
01:23:17,577 --> 01:23:20,705
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

952
01:23:20,872 --> 01:23:22,623
Hermione, no!

953
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:25,459
He's not worth it.

954
01:23:38,264 --> 01:23:41,601
- Oh!
- Malfoy, are you okay?

955
01:23:41,809 --> 01:23:46,022
- Let's go. Quick.
- Not a word to anyone.

956
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:50,610
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

957
01:24:10,046 --> 01:24:14,342
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

958
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:16,802
Why don't we just set him free?

959
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:19,388
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...

960
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:22,558
...would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.

961
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:25,102
Says he wants to be with me
when they...

962
01:24:26,103 --> 01:24:28,147
When it happens.

963
01:24:28,314 --> 01:24:29,649
Great man, Dumbledore.

964
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:31,692
A great man.

965
01:24:34,654 --> 01:24:37,657
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!

966
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:40,993
Think I want you seeing
something like that? No.

967
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:44,830
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron...

968
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:54,632
Scabbers! You're alive!

969
01:24:54,799 --> 01:24:58,511
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.

970
01:24:58,678 --> 01:25:02,431
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.

971
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:03,683
I meant me!

972
01:25:04,392 --> 01:25:06,602
Blimey. What was that?

973
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:12,483
Ow!

974
01:25:13,067 --> 01:25:14,485
Hagrid!

975
01:25:16,404 --> 01:25:17,738
Oh, crikey.

976
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:21,951
No, minister. Over this way.

977
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:26,247
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.

978
01:25:26,414 --> 01:25:30,209
Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

979
01:25:30,376 --> 01:25:33,963
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!

980
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:37,800
Quick. Quick!

981
01:25:37,967 --> 01:25:39,719
Hagrid.

982
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:43,806
- It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!

983
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:48,436
That's ling you see there--

984
01:25:48,602 --> 01:25:51,272
- On the slope-- Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.

985
01:25:51,439 --> 01:25:54,150
- Good evening.
- Make your way through.

986
01:25:54,358 --> 01:25:58,195
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.

987
01:26:00,281 --> 01:26:02,867
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.

988
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:06,412
Well, I think we should
get down to our business, shall we?

989
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:11,167
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...

990
01:26:11,334 --> 01:26:14,503
...of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...

991
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:20,176
...hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.

992
01:26:20,343 --> 01:26:23,888
- Dear, dear...
- Hagrid. Now, come on.

993
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,556
All right. It'll be all right.

994
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:29,810
- The execution shall dispatch--
- What?

995
01:26:30,561 --> 01:26:32,646
I thought I just saw--

996
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:34,940
- Never mind.
- Let's go!

997
01:26:40,029 --> 01:26:42,156
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

998
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:30,329
Oh, no.

999
01:27:41,257 --> 01:27:43,467
He bit me. Scabbers.

1000
01:27:44,051 --> 01:27:46,804
Ron. Ron!

1001
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:50,516
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.

1002
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:53,769
Wait!

1003
01:27:59,692 --> 01:28:03,988
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

1004
01:28:04,155 --> 01:28:06,449
That's not good. Ron, run!

1005
01:28:09,577 --> 01:28:11,245
Harry, Hermione, run!

1006
01:28:12,705 --> 01:28:14,331
It's the Grim!

1007
01:28:20,296 --> 01:28:23,799
- Ah! Harry!
- Ron! Ron, wait!

1008
01:28:23,966 --> 01:28:26,594
- Ron!
- Harry!

1009
01:28:28,179 --> 01:28:30,556
- Help!
- Ron!

1010
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:32,516
Ah!

1011
01:28:32,683 --> 01:28:35,936
- Ron. Ron.
- Ron!

1012
01:28:50,784 --> 01:28:52,786
Come on!

1013
01:28:54,705 --> 01:28:56,123
Move!

1014
01:29:00,169 --> 01:29:01,921
Duck!

1015
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:40,084
Harry!

1016
01:29:55,975 --> 01:29:58,978
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

1017
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:03,065
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.

1018
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:05,109
I just hope I'm wrong.

1019
01:30:24,795 --> 01:30:27,965
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

1020
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:30,676
Come on.

1021
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,438
Ron.

1022
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:45,608
- Ron. You're okay.
- The dog. Where is it?

1023
01:30:45,816 --> 01:30:49,028
It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.

1024
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:05,419
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!

1025
01:31:05,586 --> 01:31:07,671
No. Only one will die tonight.

1026
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:09,798
Then it'll be you!

1027
01:31:16,013 --> 01:31:18,182
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1028
01:31:19,391 --> 01:31:21,226
- <i>Expelliarmus!</i>
- Ah!

1029
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:29,109
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

1030
01:31:29,318 --> 01:31:32,363
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.

1031
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:36,575
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you?

1032
01:31:47,002 --> 01:31:48,212
- I found him.
- I know.

1033
01:31:48,379 --> 01:31:49,505
- It's him.
- I understand.

1034
01:31:49,672 --> 01:31:52,883
- Let's kill him!
- No! I trusted you!

1035
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:57,054
And all this time,
you've been his friend.

1036
01:31:57,763 --> 01:32:00,808
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.

1037
01:32:03,602 --> 01:32:05,312
How long have you known?

1038
01:32:05,813 --> 01:32:09,024
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.

1039
01:32:09,233 --> 01:32:11,735
You are the brightest witch
of your age I've ever met.

1040
01:32:11,902 --> 01:32:14,738
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!

1041
01:32:14,947 --> 01:32:17,574
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!

1042
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:20,160
Twelve years of it!

1043
01:32:20,786 --> 01:32:23,163
In Azkaban!

1044
01:32:32,631 --> 01:32:34,383
Very well. Kill him.

1045
01:32:34,967 --> 01:32:38,721
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

1046
01:32:38,887 --> 01:32:40,472
I know why.

1047
01:32:40,681 --> 01:32:42,933
You betrayed my parents.

1048
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:46,019
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.

1049
01:32:46,186 --> 01:32:48,105
Somebody did betray your parents...

1050
01:32:48,272 --> 01:32:51,775
...somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!

1051
01:32:51,984 --> 01:32:55,446
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!

1052
01:32:55,612 --> 01:32:58,741
And he's in this room! Right now!

1053
01:32:59,241 --> 01:33:02,202
Come out, come out, Peter!

1054
01:33:02,369 --> 01:33:05,372
- Come out, come out and play!
- <i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1055
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:10,836
Vengeance is sweet.

1056
01:33:11,003 --> 01:33:13,255
How I hoped I'd be the one
to catch you.

1057
01:33:13,422 --> 01:33:14,757
Severus--

1058
01:33:14,923 --> 01:33:19,678
I told Dumbledore you were helping a
friend into the castle. Here's the proof.

1059
01:33:19,845 --> 01:33:21,180
Brilliant, Snape.

1060
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:25,726
You've put your keen mind to the task
and come to the wrong conclusion.

1061
01:33:25,934 --> 01:33:28,604
If you'll excuse us,
Remus and I have business...

1062
01:33:28,771 --> 01:33:33,776
- ...to attend to.
- Give me a reason. I beg you!

1063
01:33:33,942 --> 01:33:36,528
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it. It's habit.

1064
01:33:36,737 --> 01:33:38,322
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!

1065
01:33:38,489 --> 01:33:40,908
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.

1066
01:33:41,074 --> 01:33:43,619
Run along and play with
your chemistry set!

1067
01:33:44,161 --> 01:33:46,663
I could do it, you know.

1068
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:52,753
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.

1069
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:55,631
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.

1070
01:33:55,798 --> 01:33:59,301
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like.

1071
01:33:59,468 --> 01:34:04,890
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but I'll do my best.

1072
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:07,351
Severus, please.

1073
01:34:08,393 --> 01:34:10,395
After you.

1074
01:34:14,817 --> 01:34:16,568
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1075
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:21,907
- Harry! What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!

1076
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:24,701
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.

1077
01:34:24,868 --> 01:34:26,537
We thought he was our friend!

1078
01:34:26,703 --> 01:34:29,706
- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
- No, he didn't.

1079
01:34:29,873 --> 01:34:33,085
I thought so too, until you mentioned
Pettigrew on the map!

1080
01:34:33,293 --> 01:34:36,088
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!

1081
01:34:36,255 --> 01:34:40,259
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!

1082
01:34:40,717 --> 01:34:45,305
- Me?! He's mental!
- Not you! Your rat!

1083
01:34:45,597 --> 01:34:48,725
- Scabbers has been in my family for--
- Twelve years?

1084
01:34:48,892 --> 01:34:51,395
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

1085
01:34:51,562 --> 01:34:54,147
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?

1086
01:34:54,314 --> 01:34:57,276
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his--
- Finger!

1087
01:34:57,484 --> 01:35:00,737
Dirty coward cut it <i>off</i>
so everyone would think he was dead!

1088
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:03,949
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.

1089
01:35:06,535 --> 01:35:09,621
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?

1090
01:35:09,788 --> 01:35:10,873
Scabbers!

1091
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:14,126
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

1092
01:35:22,092 --> 01:35:24,011
Ah!

1093
01:35:36,607 --> 01:35:38,442
Remus?

1094
01:35:39,192 --> 01:35:40,694
Sirius.

1095
01:35:40,861 --> 01:35:42,779
My old friends!

1096
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:52,247
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.

1097
01:35:52,414 --> 01:35:56,084
- James. We were the best of friends--
- How dare you speak to Harry!

1098
01:35:56,919 --> 01:35:59,546
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!

1099
01:35:59,755 --> 01:36:04,968
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!

1100
01:36:05,135 --> 01:36:07,971
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!

1101
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:10,807
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?

1102
01:36:11,183 --> 01:36:16,772
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!

1103
01:36:18,941 --> 01:36:21,318
James wouldn't have
wanted me killed!

1104
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:27,199
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!

1105
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:31,870
Should have realized if Voldemort
didn't kill you, we would. Together!

1106
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:34,122
No!

1107
01:36:35,624 --> 01:36:39,586
- Harry, this man--
- I know what he is.

1108
01:36:39,753 --> 01:36:41,672
But we'll take him to the castle.

1109
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:46,885
- Bless you, boy. Bless you!
- Get off!

1110
01:36:48,053 --> 01:36:50,430
I said we'd take you to the castle.

1111
01:36:50,806 --> 01:36:53,016
After that,
the dementors can have you.

1112
01:36:56,937 --> 01:37:00,691
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.

1113
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:04,403
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!

1114
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:06,113
I was going for the rat.

1115
01:37:06,279 --> 01:37:10,117
Normally, I have a very sweet
disposition as a dog.

1116
01:37:10,283 --> 01:37:15,539
More than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.

1117
01:37:15,706 --> 01:37:20,585
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.

1118
01:37:27,926 --> 01:37:29,469
Okay.

1119
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:34,641
Okay.

1120
01:37:39,646 --> 01:37:42,190
- You better go.
- No. Don't worry, okay?

1121
01:37:42,357 --> 01:37:43,775
It's fine. I'll stay.

1122
01:37:44,526 --> 01:37:46,528
You go, I'll stay.

1123
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:49,948
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.

1124
01:37:51,533 --> 01:37:54,536
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.

1125
01:37:54,703 --> 01:37:57,289
They might chop it.

1126
01:37:57,748 --> 01:38:00,417
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

1127
01:38:00,584 --> 01:38:04,796
It's too late. It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.

1128
01:38:06,048 --> 01:38:07,883
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1129
01:38:08,717 --> 01:38:12,471
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.

1130
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:16,349
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

1131
01:38:18,477 --> 01:38:21,313
That was a noble thing
you did back there.

1132
01:38:22,105 --> 01:38:24,274
He doesn't deserve it.

1133
01:38:24,441 --> 01:38:27,110
I didn't think my dad
would have wanted his best friends...

1134
01:38:27,277 --> 01:38:28,820
...to become killers.

1135
01:38:29,488 --> 01:38:33,200
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.

1136
01:38:33,366 --> 01:38:35,744
Alive, you're free.

1137
01:38:35,911 --> 01:38:38,997
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!

1138
01:38:39,206 --> 01:38:42,542
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...

1139
01:38:42,709 --> 01:38:45,212
...to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!

1140
01:38:45,378 --> 01:38:49,424
- Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't--
- Get away from her!

1141
01:38:51,885 --> 01:38:53,804
I don't know if you know, Harry...

1142
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:58,058
...but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.

1143
01:38:58,225 --> 01:39:00,185
I know.

1144
01:39:01,353 --> 01:39:05,398
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...

1145
01:39:05,565 --> 01:39:08,068
...but if you ever wanted
a different home...

1146
01:39:08,235 --> 01:39:10,737
What? Come and live with you?

1147
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:15,200
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.

1148
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:16,952
Harry!

1149
01:39:32,384 --> 01:39:35,887
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

1150
01:39:37,389 --> 01:39:42,727
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!

1151
01:39:44,062 --> 01:39:46,064
This flesh is only flesh!

1152
01:39:47,232 --> 01:39:49,317
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1153
01:39:59,411 --> 01:40:00,954
Harry!

1154
01:40:02,038 --> 01:40:05,000
Remus! Remus!

1155
01:40:11,214 --> 01:40:13,550
Run! Run!

1156
01:40:23,602 --> 01:40:25,604
- Come on.
- Wait. Wait.

1157
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:30,859
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1158
01:40:31,026 --> 01:40:33,278
Professor?

1159
01:40:37,365 --> 01:40:38,909
Professor Lupin?

1160
01:40:46,666 --> 01:40:49,920
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1161
01:40:50,337 --> 01:40:52,881
There you are, Potter!

1162
01:41:26,665 --> 01:41:27,707
Sirius!

1163
01:41:28,541 --> 01:41:30,961
Come back here, Potter!

1164
01:42:36,776 --> 01:42:38,194
Sirius!

1165
01:42:38,987 --> 01:42:41,948
No. Sirius!

1166
01:43:23,823 --> 01:43:26,701
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

1167
01:45:39,751 --> 01:45:41,878
Harry?

1168
01:45:42,795 --> 01:45:45,173
I saw my dad.

1169
01:45:45,381 --> 01:45:46,925
What?

1170
01:45:47,133 --> 01:45:48,676
He sent the dementors away.

1171
01:45:48,843 --> 01:45:50,261
I saw him across the lake.

1172
01:45:50,428 --> 01:45:52,096
Harry, they've captured Sirius.

1173
01:45:52,305 --> 01:45:55,141
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

1174
01:45:55,308 --> 01:45:57,810
- They're gonna kill him?
- No. It's worse.

1175
01:45:58,019 --> 01:45:59,854
Much worse.

1176
01:46:00,021 --> 01:46:02,398
They're going to suck out his soul.

1177
01:46:04,108 --> 01:46:05,485
Headmaster, stop them.

1178
01:46:05,652 --> 01:46:09,030
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true. Sirius is innocent.

1179
01:46:09,197 --> 01:46:11,407
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?

1180
01:46:11,574 --> 01:46:12,951
He's my rat, sir.

1181
01:46:13,368 --> 01:46:17,163
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.

1182
01:46:17,372 --> 01:46:21,042
- But then they gave him an owl--
- The point is, we know the truth.

1183
01:46:21,251 --> 01:46:23,753
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.

1184
01:46:23,962 --> 01:46:29,384
But the word of three 13-year-old
wizards will convince few others.

1185
01:46:32,470 --> 01:46:35,265
A child's voice,
however honest and true...

1186
01:46:35,431 --> 01:46:39,185
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

1187
01:46:44,399 --> 01:46:46,943
Mysterious thing, time.

1188
01:46:48,111 --> 01:46:49,445
Powerful...

1189
01:46:49,612 --> 01:46:52,490
...and when meddled with,
dangerous.

1190
01:46:54,075 --> 01:46:57,704
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell
of the Dark Tower.

1191
01:46:58,496 --> 01:47:00,623
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

1192
01:47:00,790 --> 01:47:02,584
You must not be seen.

1193
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:06,421
And you would do well, I feel,
to return before this last chime.

1194
01:47:06,588 --> 01:47:10,133
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

1195
01:47:10,675 --> 01:47:12,468
If you succeed tonight...

1196
01:47:12,635 --> 01:47:15,471
...more than one innocent life
may be spared.

1197
01:47:17,307 --> 01:47:19,517
Three turns should do it, I think.

1198
01:47:24,397 --> 01:47:26,232
Oh, and by the way.

1199
01:47:26,399 --> 01:47:32,238
When in doubt, I find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.

1200
01:47:32,405 --> 01:47:34,490
Good luck.

1201
01:47:34,991 --> 01:47:37,452
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

1202
01:47:38,119 --> 01:47:40,455
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk...

1203
01:48:09,442 --> 01:48:11,069
What just happened?

1204
01:48:11,235 --> 01:48:13,529
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.

1205
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:15,573
Where were we at 7:30?

1206
01:48:15,740 --> 01:48:17,533
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

1207
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:20,078
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1208
01:48:21,162 --> 01:48:22,997
Hermione!

1209
01:48:41,182 --> 01:48:43,851
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1210
01:48:45,645 --> 01:48:47,855
Will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

1211
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:49,273
Come to see the show?

1212
01:48:49,440 --> 01:48:52,276
You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

1213
01:48:52,443 --> 01:48:53,778
That's us.

1214
01:48:53,986 --> 01:48:56,906
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

1215
01:48:57,115 --> 01:48:58,574
This is not normal.

1216
01:49:00,868 --> 01:49:03,246
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1217
01:49:03,413 --> 01:49:05,623
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1218
01:49:05,790 --> 01:49:09,127
This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.

1219
01:49:09,335 --> 01:49:12,547
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.

1220
01:49:12,714 --> 01:49:16,092
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

1221
01:49:18,386 --> 01:49:21,556
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.

1222
01:49:24,684 --> 01:49:26,018
Good punch.

1223
01:49:26,185 --> 01:49:27,687
Thanks.

1224
01:49:28,688 --> 01:49:30,356
Malfoy's coming.

1225
01:49:31,274 --> 01:49:33,609
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone.

1226
01:49:34,068 --> 01:49:37,155
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.

1227
01:49:37,321 --> 01:49:41,242
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

1228
01:49:42,618 --> 01:49:45,204
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

1229
01:50:04,348 --> 01:50:06,893
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

1230
01:50:08,352 --> 01:50:10,229
Of course.

1231
01:50:10,396 --> 01:50:12,398
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1232
01:50:12,565 --> 01:50:16,611
If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.

1233
01:50:16,986 --> 01:50:18,321
Let's go.

1234
01:50:39,592 --> 01:50:41,719
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

1235
01:50:41,886 --> 01:50:44,388
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

1236
01:50:44,555 --> 01:50:47,016
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

1237
01:50:48,059 --> 01:50:50,436
Scabbers, you're alive!

1238
01:50:50,603 --> 01:50:53,397
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.

1239
01:50:53,606 --> 01:50:56,526
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.

1240
01:50:56,692 --> 01:50:59,695
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!

1241
01:51:03,574 --> 01:51:06,285
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

1242
01:51:06,452 --> 01:51:09,288
If you go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.

1243
01:51:09,455 --> 01:51:12,333
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time.

1244
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:14,377
We can't be seen.

1245
01:51:18,047 --> 01:51:19,757
Fudge is coming.

1246
01:51:20,675 --> 01:51:22,760
And we aren't leaving?

1247
01:51:24,929 --> 01:51:26,514
Why aren't we leaving?

1248
01:51:37,441 --> 01:51:38,985
Are you mad?

1249
01:51:42,113 --> 01:51:43,698
Ow!

1250
01:51:43,865 --> 01:51:46,367
Ow. That hurt.

1251
01:51:46,576 --> 01:51:47,910
Sorry.

1252
01:51:58,045 --> 01:52:04,844
That's ling
you see there-- Ah, Hagrid.

1253
01:52:08,764 --> 01:52:11,434
We're coming out the back door. Go!

1254
01:52:28,826 --> 01:52:31,329
Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?

1255
01:52:33,706 --> 01:52:35,041
What?

1256
01:52:35,917 --> 01:52:37,752
I thought I just saw...

1257
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:40,630
- Never mind.
- Let's go.

1258
01:52:54,936 --> 01:52:57,229
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

1259
01:53:03,486 --> 01:53:05,446
Get away. Get off.

1260
01:53:21,963 --> 01:53:23,631
Ow!

1261
01:53:27,635 --> 01:53:31,055
Minister, I really think
I should sign as well.

1262
01:53:31,889 --> 01:53:35,059
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...

1263
01:53:35,267 --> 01:53:39,063
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

1264
01:53:43,526 --> 01:53:46,237
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

1265
01:53:48,614 --> 01:53:52,410
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1266
01:53:53,244 --> 01:53:56,539
- Your name only.
- It's a very long name...

1267
01:53:56,914 --> 01:53:58,624
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1268
01:54:01,335 --> 01:54:04,296
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.

1269
01:54:04,505 --> 01:54:06,799
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1270
01:54:09,427 --> 01:54:13,931
- Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
- Here, minister. Follow me.

1271
01:54:14,140 --> 01:54:15,808
- Now, look there.
- Where?

1272
01:54:16,017 --> 01:54:19,395
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?

1273
01:54:19,562 --> 01:54:23,065
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.

1274
01:54:23,232 --> 01:54:26,068
- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.

1275
01:54:27,028 --> 01:54:29,655
- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
- I see no strawberries.

1276
01:54:29,822 --> 01:54:31,240
- There.
- Where?

1277
01:54:31,407 --> 01:54:33,159
- There.
- This way.

1278
01:54:33,367 --> 01:54:36,037
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.

1279
01:54:37,705 --> 01:54:39,415
But where is it?

1280
01:54:40,332 --> 01:54:42,543
I saw the beast, just now.

1281
01:54:43,169 --> 01:54:45,379
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.

1282
01:54:45,546 --> 01:54:46,881
Buckbeak.

1283
01:54:47,089 --> 01:54:51,177
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

1284
01:54:51,343 --> 01:54:52,678
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.

1285
01:54:52,887 --> 01:54:57,141
I don't think he suggests
you had anything to do with this.

1286
01:54:57,349 --> 01:55:00,186
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.

1287
01:55:00,352 --> 01:55:02,229
- Right.
- Well, well.

1288
01:55:02,396 --> 01:55:03,939
We must search the grounds.

1289
01:55:04,106 --> 01:55:07,151
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.

1290
01:55:07,318 --> 01:55:12,740
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.

1291
01:55:12,907 --> 01:55:16,911
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.

1292
01:55:17,078 --> 01:55:18,954
Thank you.

1293
01:55:19,163 --> 01:55:22,458
You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.

1294
01:55:33,177 --> 01:55:34,720
- Come on.
- This way.

1295
01:55:41,519 --> 01:55:43,312
This way, now.

1296
01:55:45,731 --> 01:55:47,483
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.

1297
01:55:47,691 --> 01:55:50,194
- How?
- No idea.

1298
01:55:59,495 --> 01:56:01,872
- Look. It's Lupin.
<i>- Immobulus!</i>

1299
01:56:08,295 --> 01:56:10,297
And Snape's coming.

1300
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:18,180
And now we wait.

1301
01:56:19,390 --> 01:56:21,183
And now we wait.

1302
01:56:42,663 --> 01:56:44,498
Ah!

1303
01:56:48,752 --> 01:56:50,796
At least someone's enjoying himself.

1304
01:56:50,963 --> 01:56:52,006
Yeah.

1305
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:56,594
- Hermione?
- Yeah?

1306
01:56:56,760 --> 01:57:01,098
Before, down by the lake,
when I was with Sirius...

1307
01:57:01,265 --> 01:57:03,392
...I did see someone.

1308
01:57:03,559 --> 01:57:06,979
That someone
made the dementors go away.

1309
01:57:07,146 --> 01:57:08,480
With a Patronus.

1310
01:57:08,647 --> 01:57:10,566
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1311
01:57:10,733 --> 01:57:12,193
According to him...

1312
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:15,779
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.

1313
01:57:15,946 --> 01:57:17,823
It was my dad.

1314
01:57:18,949 --> 01:57:20,743
My dad conjured the Patronus.

1315
01:57:20,910 --> 01:57:23,162
- Harry, but your dad's--
- Dead. I know.

1316
01:57:24,580 --> 01:57:26,916
I'm just telling you what I saw.

1317
01:57:31,045 --> 01:57:32,671
Here we come.

1318
01:57:38,302 --> 01:57:40,721
- You see Sirius talking to me?
- Uh-huh.

1319
01:57:40,888 --> 01:57:43,724
- He's asking me to live with him.
- That's great.

1320
01:57:43,891 --> 01:57:47,228
When we free him, I'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.

1321
01:57:47,394 --> 01:57:49,021
It'll just be me and him.

1322
01:57:49,688 --> 01:57:51,649
We could live in the country...

1323
01:57:51,815 --> 01:57:54,443
...someplace you can see the sky.

1324
01:57:54,610 --> 01:57:57,446
He'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.

1325
01:57:58,489 --> 01:57:59,782
Harry!

1326
01:58:01,575 --> 01:58:03,285
Run!

1327
01:58:10,167 --> 01:58:11,710
Let's go.

1328
01:58:31,272 --> 01:58:33,607
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

1329
01:58:37,861 --> 01:58:39,238
Thanks.

1330
01:58:41,073 --> 01:58:45,119
- Great. Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

1331
02:00:00,235 --> 02:00:01,987
That was so scary.

1332
02:00:02,154 --> 02:00:05,115
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.

1333
02:00:16,543 --> 02:00:19,671
Sirius. Come on!

1334
02:00:35,687 --> 02:00:37,815
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.

1335
02:00:37,981 --> 02:00:41,193
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.

1336
02:00:49,910 --> 02:00:51,745
Any minute now.

1337
02:00:51,954 --> 02:00:53,997
Right there. You'll see.

1338
02:00:55,374 --> 02:00:57,876
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.

1339
02:00:58,043 --> 02:01:00,587
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.

1340
02:01:04,716 --> 02:01:07,177
- Sirius.
- You're dying...

1341
02:01:09,221 --> 02:01:11,098
...both of you.

1342
02:01:13,183 --> 02:01:14,893
Harry!

1343
02:01:16,812 --> 02:01:20,691
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

1344
02:02:19,291 --> 02:02:20,876
You were right, Hermione.

1345
02:02:21,043 --> 02:02:24,379
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!

1346
02:02:24,546 --> 02:02:27,299
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.

1347
02:02:27,466 --> 02:02:29,843
I knew I could do it
this time because...

1348
02:02:30,010 --> 02:02:31,720
...well, I had already done it.

1349
02:02:31,887 --> 02:02:34,348
- Does that make sense?
- No.

1350
02:02:34,515 --> 02:02:35,766
But I don't like flying...!

1351
02:02:50,489 --> 02:02:51,823
<i>Bombarda!</i>

1352
02:03:25,148 --> 02:03:27,943
I'll be forever grateful for this...

1353
02:03:28,110 --> 02:03:29,444
...to both of you.

1354
02:03:29,611 --> 02:03:32,531
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.

1355
02:03:32,698 --> 02:03:35,617
For some time,
my life will be too unpredictable.

1356
02:03:35,784 --> 02:03:37,536
And besides...

1357
02:03:38,453 --> 02:03:41,748
- ...you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.

1358
02:03:41,915 --> 02:03:44,042
And you know it.

1359
02:03:45,127 --> 02:03:47,004
And for now, that will do.

1360
02:03:49,339 --> 02:03:51,883
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

1361
02:03:52,884 --> 02:03:55,429
...but you look so like your father.

1362
02:03:57,180 --> 02:03:59,141
Except your eyes.

1363
02:04:00,100 --> 02:04:02,394
- You have--
- My mother's eyes.

1364
02:04:04,354 --> 02:04:09,443
It's cruel that I spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.

1365
02:04:10,027 --> 02:04:11,528
But know this:

1366
02:04:12,654 --> 02:04:15,824
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

1367
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:19,161
And you can always find them...

1368
02:04:21,538 --> 02:04:23,415
...in here.

1369
02:04:33,800 --> 02:04:36,345
You really are the brightest witch
of your age.

1370
02:05:03,163 --> 02:05:04,790
We have to go.

1371
02:05:33,068 --> 02:05:35,737
- Well?
- He's free. We did it.

1372
02:05:35,904 --> 02:05:37,447
Did what?

1373
02:05:37,614 --> 02:05:39,574
Good night.

1374
02:05:48,333 --> 02:05:49,668
How did you get there?

1375
02:05:49,835 --> 02:05:52,504
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

1376
02:05:52,838 --> 02:05:55,465
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.

1377
02:05:55,632 --> 02:05:59,177
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?

1378
02:06:25,662 --> 02:06:27,164
Hello, Harry.

1379
02:06:30,792 --> 02:06:32,627
I saw you coming.

1380
02:06:37,174 --> 02:06:39,885
I've looked worse, believe me.

1381
02:06:42,596 --> 02:06:45,766
- You've been sacked.
- No.

1382
02:06:45,932 --> 02:06:48,894
No. I resigned, actually.

1383
02:06:49,060 --> 02:06:50,854
Resigned? Why?

1384
02:06:51,021 --> 02:06:56,318
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.

1385
02:06:56,485 --> 02:07:01,990
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...

1386
02:07:02,157 --> 02:07:05,535
...well, someone like me
teaching their children.

1387
02:07:05,744 --> 02:07:07,662
- But Dumbledore--
- He has already...

1388
02:07:07,829 --> 02:07:09,706
...risked enough on my behalf.

1389
02:07:09,873 --> 02:07:13,126
Besides, people like me are...

1390
02:07:13,752 --> 02:07:17,088
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.

1391
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:29,226
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

1392
02:07:29,392 --> 02:07:31,561
None of it made any difference.

1393
02:07:31,728 --> 02:07:35,273
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?

1394
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:38,944
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.

1395
02:07:39,110 --> 02:07:41,613
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

1396
02:07:41,988 --> 02:07:44,491
It made a great deal of difference.

1397
02:07:49,120 --> 02:07:51,331
If I am proud of anything...

1398
02:07:51,498 --> 02:07:54,167
...it is of how much
you have learned this year.

1399
02:07:54,334 --> 02:07:57,087
Now, since I am no longer
your teacher...

1400
02:07:57,254 --> 02:08:01,508
...I feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

1401
02:08:02,425 --> 02:08:04,928
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

1402
02:08:05,095 --> 02:08:07,681
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1403
02:08:08,223 --> 02:08:09,558
Until then...

1404
02:08:10,892 --> 02:08:12,602
...mischief managed.

1405
02:08:46,845 --> 02:08:51,057
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.

1406
02:08:51,224 --> 02:08:52,642
Harry.

1407
02:08:53,476 --> 02:08:54,853
Wherever did you get it?

1408
02:08:55,020 --> 02:08:57,439
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.

1409
02:08:57,606 --> 02:08:59,774
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.

1410
02:08:59,941 --> 02:09:03,236
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

1411
02:09:03,403 --> 02:09:05,906
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.

1412
02:09:06,072 --> 02:09:07,574
Did not.

1413
02:09:08,950 --> 02:09:12,454
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.

1414
02:09:12,621 --> 02:09:14,164
For me?

1415
02:09:14,331 --> 02:09:16,875
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.

1416
02:09:17,042 --> 02:09:18,960
This came with it.

1417
02:09:23,798 --> 02:09:25,467
- Go!
- Let's see.

1418
02:09:25,634 --> 02:09:27,469
How fast is it, Harry?

1419
02:09:47,447 --> 02:09:48,448
Lumos.

1420
02:09:48,615 --> 02:09:51,034
<i>I solemnly swear that I am
up to no good.</i>

1421
02:21:10,212 --> 02:21:12,006
<i>Mischief managed.</i>

1422
02:21:17,762 --> 02:21:19,221
<i>Nox.</i>
