1
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:56,807
<i>I don't know about you,
it's just too hot today, isn't it?</i>

2
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:01,312
<i>And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures in the mid-30s Celsius...</i>

3
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:05,191
<i>...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.</i>

4
00:01:05,358 --> 00:01:08,027
<i>So, please, remember to cover up
and stay cool...</i>

5
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:11,030
<i>...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.</i>

6
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:13,950
Come on, guys, time to go home.

7
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,827
Come on, love, off you get.

8
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:22,208
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.

9
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,753
I'll make you your favorite dinner
to compensate.

10
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,798
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?

11
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:32,510
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?

12
00:01:32,677 --> 00:01:34,512
Hey, Big D.

13
00:01:35,388 --> 00:01:37,014
Beat up another 10-year-old?

14
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,684
- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:44,522
- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.

16
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:49,944
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

17
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:54,949
"Don't kill Cedric."

18
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:57,034
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?

19
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:02,373
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum."

20
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,042
Where is your mum?

21
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,504
Where is your mum, Potter?

22
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,715
She dead?

23
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,551
Is she dead?

24
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,386
Is she a dead Pott--?

25
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,402
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.

26
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:36,157
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

27
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:39,285
- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.

28
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:40,995
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

29
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:33,297
Dudley, run.

30
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,334
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

31
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,991
Mrs. Figg.

32
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,955
Don't put away your wand, Harry.

33
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,624
They might come back.

34
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,879
Dementors in Little Whinging,
whatever next?

35
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:59,008
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy.
- I don't understand. How do you know--?

36
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:01,385
Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.

37
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,930
Dumbledore asked you?
You know Dumbledore?

38
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:08,934
After You-Know-Who
killed that poor Diggory boy last year...

39
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,770
...did you expect him to let you
go wandering on your own?

40
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:14,607
Good Lord, boy.
They told me you were intelligent.

41
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,902
Now, get inside and stay there.

42
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:22,740
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

43
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:34,543
<i>It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.</i>

44
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,837
<i>There's sweat. There's stifling.</i>

45
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,923
Diddykins?

46
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,258
Is that you?

47
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,598
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.

48
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,809
We're going to have to
take him to a hospital.

49
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,103
Who did this to you, boy?

50
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,276
Happy, are we, now?

51
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:03,280
You've finally done it.
You've finally driven him loopy.

52
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,283
Vernon, don't say that.

53
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,788
Well, just look at him, Petunia.
Our boy has gone yumpy.

54
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,123
I've reached my limit, do you hear?

55
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,127
This is the last I'm gonna take
of you and your nonsense.

56
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,143
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?

57
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:38,566
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...

58
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:43,487
...you performed the Patronus Charm
in the presence of a Muggle.

59
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:45,739
As a clear violation...

60
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,994
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...

61
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,288
...you are hereby expelled...

62
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:56,166
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

63
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:01,297
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.

64
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,761
Justice.

65
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:22,192
He's not very well.

66
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:36,540
Sorry, Hedwig.

67
00:07:36,540 --> 00:08:06,540
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

68
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,526
Very clean, these Muggles.

69
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,779
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.

70
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,284
Professor Moody.

71
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,788
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.

72
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,377
But where are we going?
The letter said I've been expelled.

73
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,963
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.

74
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,172
But the letter said--

75
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,342
Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...

76
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,678
- ...pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?

77
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:16,223
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

78
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,684
Not here, Nymphadora.

79
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:22,688
Don't call me Nymphadora.

80
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:32,156
Stay in formation, everyone.
Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.

81
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:23,999
Come on, you, around the corner.

82
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,503
Come on.

83
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,710
In you go, son.

84
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:11,755
There've been no sightings.

85
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:13,632
No deaths. No proof.

86
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:16,677
He almost killed Harry.
If that isn't proof enough...

87
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:20,764
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important...

88
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,477
We must trust Dumbledore on this.

89
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:30,065
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Tonight I say it's time to take action.

90
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:33,443
Cornelius Fudge is a politician first
and a wizard second.

91
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,780
- His instinct would be to ignore it--
- Keep your voices down.

92
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:41,368
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.

93
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,624
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

94
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,796
Heavens, you're all right.

95
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,012
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait
until after the meeting's finished.

96
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:05,309
Nope. No time to explain.
Straight upstairs, first door on the left.

97
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,144
Yeah.

98
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:14,610
Mudblood, werewolves,
traitors, thieves.

99
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:19,656
If my poor mistress
knew the scum they let into her house...

100
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,117
...what would she say to old Kreacher?

101
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,163
Oh, the shame.

102
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,261
- <i>Freaks.</i>
- There, there, mistress.

103
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,848
<i>Scum of the earth.
Not like it was in the days of my fathers.</i>

104
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,643
Kreacher is here.

105
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,148
Oh, Harry.

106
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:59,780
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.

107
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:02,783
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.

108
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,162
And this hearing at the Ministry.
It's just outrageous.

109
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,498
I've looked it up.
They simply can't expel you.

110
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:12,376
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.

111
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,504
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.

112
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,341
So, what is this place?

113
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:22,219
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.

114
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,471
It's a secret society.

115
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:27,224
Dumbledore formed it back when
they fought You-Know-Who.

116
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,977
Couldn't have put any of this
in a letter, I suppose?

117
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,854
I've gone all summer
without a scrap of news.

118
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:37,067
We wanted to write, mate.
Really, we did.

119
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,276
- Only...
- Only what?

120
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,655
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

121
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,158
Dumbledore said that?

122
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:49,705
But why would he keep me in the dark?
Maybe I could help.

123
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,832
I'm the one
who saw Voldemort return...

124
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,835
...the one who fought him,
who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.

125
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:57,212
- Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

126
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:01,425
- Don't bottle it up, though. Let it out.
- If you're all done shouting...

127
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,094
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?

128
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,765
<i>If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry.
If it wasn't for Harry...</i>

129
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,976
<i>...we wouldn't even know
Voldemort was back.</i>

130
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:12,728
<i>He's not a child, Molly.</i>

131
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,272
<i>But he's not an adult either.</i>

132
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:18,483
<i>-He's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he's not your son.</i>

133
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,819
<i>He's as good as.</i>

134
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,904
- <i>Who else has he got?</i>
- Hey, Ginny.

135
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,490
<i>-He's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.</i>

136
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,785
<i>Perhaps Potter will grow up
to be a felon, just like his godfather.</i>

137
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,704
<i>Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.</i>

138
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,956
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.

139
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,958
- <i>-About your supposed reformation.</i>

140
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,878
<i>-I know better.
- So why don't you tell him?</i>

141
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,755
- Get off it.
- Quick.

142
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,548
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.

143
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,134
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.

144
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,553
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.

145
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:52,184
- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.

146
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:56,104
Well, we'll be eating
down in the kitchen.

147
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,357
Just because you're allowed
to use magic now...

148
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:02,569
...does not mean you have to
whip your wands out for everything.

149
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,321
Hi, Mum.

150
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,032
You hungry, Harry?

151
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,826
You sure you're all right, Harry?
Gave us quite a turn.

152
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,162
Harry Potter.

153
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,166
Sirius.

154
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,174
This is very, very peculiar.

155
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:28,011
It seems your hearing at the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

156
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:31,640
I don't understand. What has
the Ministry of Magic got against me?

157
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,977
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.

158
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:49,366
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

159
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:56,206
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the <i>Daily Prophet...</i>

160
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,543
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

161
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,002
Why?

162
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,130
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.

163
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,423
No one in their right mind
could believe that--

164
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,468
Exactly the point.
Fudge isn't in his right mind.

165
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,179
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

166
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:15,267
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.

167
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,894
The last time
Voldemort gained power...

168
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:21,398
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.

169
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:25,485
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid
the minister will do almost anything...

170
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,572
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

171
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:34,536
We think Voldemort
wants to build up his army again.

172
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,331
Fourteen years ago,
he had huge numbers at his command.

173
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:43,086
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.

174
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,716
He's been recruiting heavily, and we've
been attempting to do the same.

175
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:52,429
But gathering followers
isn't the only thing he's interested in.

176
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,184
We believe...

177
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:00,103
...Voldemort may be after something.

178
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,396
Sirius.

179
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,903
Something he didn't have last time.

180
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,406
You mean like a weapon?

181
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:15,619
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.

182
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,622
You say more and you might as well
induct him into the Order.

183
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:22,584
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.

184
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,932
<i>Harry.</i>

185
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,351
<i>You are hereby expelled.</i>

186
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:42,312
<i>Before the entire Wizengamot.</i>

187
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,448
Trains. Underground.

188
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,909
Ingenious, these Muggles.

189
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,928
Here we are.

190
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:21,184
I've never used the visitors' entrance
before. Should be fun.

191
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:26,231
Right. Good.
I'll just get my Muggle money.

192
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:09,149
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.

193
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:12,610
<i>Daily Prophet,</i> ladies and gentlemen.
Anybody for <i>Daily Prophet?</i>

194
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:15,780
Dumbledore: Is he daft,
or is he dangerous?

195
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:40,555
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.

196
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,768
Interdepartmental memos.

197
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:48,897
We used to use owls.
Mess was unbelievable.

198
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:57,405
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.

199
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,449
They've changed the time
of your hearing.

200
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:00,992
When is it?

201
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,286
In five minutes.

202
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,172
<i>Department of Mysteries.</i>

203
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:20,845
And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.

204
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,139
Yes, but we must be--

205
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,691
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.

206
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:37,404
Keep calm.
You've done nothing wrong.

207
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,990
As the Muggles say, truth will out.

208
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:42,826
Yes?

209
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,329
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.

210
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,707
Good luck, Harry.

211
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,172
Disciplinary hearing
of the 12th of August...

212
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:59,300
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...

213
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:03,096
...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive,
Little Whinging, Surrey.

214
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:06,349
Interrogators:Cornelius Oswald Fudge,
Minister of Mag--

215
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,351
Witness for the defense.

216
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:11,688
Albus Percival Wulfric...

217
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:15,442
...Brian Dumbledore.

218
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:19,028
You got our message
that the time and place of the hearing...

219
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,739
- ...had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.

220
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:25,869
But by a happy mistake, I arrived
at the Ministry three hours early.

221
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,039
The charges?

222
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,709
The charges against the accused
are as follows:

223
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:34,544
"That he did knowingly...

224
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:38,256
...and in full awareness
of the illegality of his actions...

225
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:41,426
...produce a Patronus Charm...

226
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:44,846
...in the presence of a Muggle."

227
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:48,308
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but--

228
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:51,936
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...

229
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,981
- ...while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but--

230
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:58,526
Witches and wizards
of the Wizengamot--

231
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:00,904
I was only doing it
because of the Dementors.

232
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,283
Dementors?

233
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:07,577
In Little Whinging?

234
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:10,079
That's quite clever.

235
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:13,416
Muggles can't see Dementors,
can they, boy?

236
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,793
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.

237
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,546
- There were two of them, if I hadn't--
- Enough.

238
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:22,926
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure
would be a very well-rehearsed story...

239
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:27,597
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event--

240
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:32,352
Pardon me, minister,
but as it happens, we can.

241
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,775
Please describe the attack.

242
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,363
What did they look like?

243
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:49,369
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.

244
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,289
Not the boys. The Dementors.

245
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:57,126
Oh, right, right. Well, big.

246
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:02,924
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...

247
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,970
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.

248
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:12,225
Now, look here. Dementors don't just
wander into a Muggle suburb...

249
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:16,020
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.

250
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:17,939
I don't think anyone would believe...

251
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:21,150
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

252
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:26,531
I'm sure I must have misunderstood you,
professor.

253
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:32,203
Dementors are, after all, under
the control of the Ministry of Magic.

254
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:36,583
And it's so silly of me, but it sounded
for a moment as though...

255
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:40,753
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

256
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,715
That would be disturbing indeed,
Madam Undersecretary...

257
00:23:43,881 --> 00:23:48,052
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...

258
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:51,598
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...

259
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:55,143
...and why they mounted an attack
without authorization.

260
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:58,229
Of course, there is someone...

261
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:01,190
...who might be behind the attack.

262
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:08,823
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.

263
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,536
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.

264
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:16,497
He is not back.

265
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,589
In the matter of Harry Potter...

266
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:27,592
...the law clearly states...

267
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:32,221
...that magic may be used before
Muggles in life-threatening situations.

268
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,308
Laws can be changed if necessary,
Dumbledore.

269
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:38,645
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...

270
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,689
...to deal with a simple matter
of underage magic?

271
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:53,660
Those in favor of conviction?

272
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,423
Those in favor
of clearing the accused of all charges?

273
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,773
Cleared of all charges.

274
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:28,569
Professor.

275
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:44,585
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?

276
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,130
You'll blow the entire operation.

277
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,141
Sirius, what are you doing here?
If somebody sees you...

278
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,935
I had to see you off, didn't I?

279
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:05,231
What's life without a little risk?

280
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,775
I don't wanna see you
get chucked back in Azkaban.

281
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:09,402
Don't worry about me.

282
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:14,824
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

283
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:23,249
Original Order of the Phoenix.

284
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,501
Marlene McKinnon.

285
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:28,254
She was killed
two weeks after this was taken.

286
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,799
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.

287
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,010
Frank and Alice Longbottom.

288
00:26:34,177 --> 00:26:35,678
Neville's parents.

289
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:39,515
They suffered a fate worse than death,
you ask me.

290
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:43,936
It's been 14 years.

291
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:48,983
And still a day doesn't go by
I don't miss your dad.

292
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:56,324
Do you really think
there's going to be a war, Sirius?

293
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:02,038
It feels like it did before.

294
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,044
You keep it.

295
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:12,924
Anyway, I suppose
you're the young ones now.

296
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,969
I'll see you at the train.

297
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,180
Bye-bye, darling.

298
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:21,557
I love you.

299
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,310
Hold my hand, lovey.

300
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,854
There they are.
They're in the far carriage.

301
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,314
Bye.

302
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:13,442
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.

303
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,111
Better enjoy it while you can.

304
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,573
I expect there's a cell in Azkaban
with your name on it.

305
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:25,121
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!

306
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,165
It's only Malfoy.

307
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,835
What'd you expect?

308
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:51,981
Hi, guys.

309
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,816
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.

310
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:08,414
What is it?

311
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,836
- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.

312
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,006
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

313
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:19,842
It's pulling itself, like always.

314
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:35,691
You're not going mad.

315
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,529
I can see them too.

316
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:44,367
You're just as sane as I am.

317
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:51,248
Everyone, this is Loony Love--

318
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:55,962
Luna Lovegood.

319
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:02,218
What an interesting necklace.

320
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,929
It's a charm, actually.

321
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,890
Keeps away the Nargles.

322
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:13,187
Hungry.

323
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,815
I hope there's pudding.

324
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:20,403
- What's a Nargle?
- No idea.

325
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:34,750
Good evening, children.

326
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:38,754
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.

327
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:41,966
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

328
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:44,719
...who'll be taking
Care of Magical Creatures...

329
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:48,347
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

330
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:53,185
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

331
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:56,522
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.

332
00:30:56,814 --> 00:31:00,568
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.

333
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,365
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you--

334
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,171
She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.

335
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:26,052
Thank you, headmaster,
for those kind words of welcome.

336
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:31,098
And how lovely to see all your bright...

337
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:34,101
...happy faces smiling up at me.

338
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:39,648
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.

339
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,068
- That's likely.
- That's likely.

340
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:47,865
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...

341
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:53,662
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.

342
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:56,290
Although each headmaster...

343
00:31:56,457 --> 00:32:01,295
...has brought something new
to this historic school...

344
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:09,011
...progress for the sake of progress
must be discouraged.

345
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,557
Let us preserve
what must be preserved...

346
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:17,228
...perfect what can be perfected...

347
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:24,026
...and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.

348
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:35,204
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.

349
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:39,708
- Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?

350
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,628
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...

351
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:46,382
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

352
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:07,903
Dean, Seamus.

353
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,322
- Good holiday?
- All right.

354
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:12,908
Better than Seamus', anyway.

355
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:16,579
Me mum didn't want me
to come back this year.

356
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:20,040
- Why not?
- Let me see. Because of you.

357
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:23,836
The <i>Daily Prophet's</i> been saying a lot
of things about you and Dumbledore.

358
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:25,337
What, your mum believes them?

359
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,423
Nobody was there
the night Cedric died.

360
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,676
I guess you should read the <i>Prophet,</i>
then, like your stupid mother.

361
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:34,346
- Don't talk about my mother.
- I'll have a go at anyone calling me a liar.

362
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,016
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.

363
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:40,269
Do you believe the rubbish he's
come out with about You-Know-Who?

364
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:42,104
Yeah. I do.

365
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:45,065
Has anyone else
got a problem with Harry?

366
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,911
- You all right?
- Fine.

367
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:59,872
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.

368
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:04,210
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.

369
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,301
Right. I'll just leave you
to your thoughts, then.

370
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:41,747
<i>Harry.</i>

371
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:59,348
Bring it over here. Over here.

372
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:03,143
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.

373
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,202
Good morning, children.

374
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:27,376
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.

375
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:30,129
O-W-Ls.

376
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:34,883
More commonly known as OWLs.

377
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:38,178
Study hard and you will be rewarded.

378
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:43,767
Fail to do so,
and the consequences may be severe.

379
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:54,403
Your previous instruction in this subject
has been disturbingly uneven.

380
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,739
But you'll be pleased to know,
from now on...

381
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:00,409
...you will be following a carefully
structured, Ministry-approved...

382
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:03,245
...course of defensive magic. Yes?

383
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,207
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?

384
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:08,917
Using spells?

385
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:12,546
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.

386
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:15,841
We're not gonna use magic?

387
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:21,013
You'll be learning about defensive spells
in a secure, risk-free way.

388
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,932
What use is that?
If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.

389
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,061
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.

390
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,108
It is the view of the Ministry...

391
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:36,028
...that a theoretical knowledge
will be sufficient...

392
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:38,155
...to get you through
your examinations...

393
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:40,783
...which, after all,
is what school is all about.

394
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,744
And how's theory supposed
to prepare us for what's out there?

395
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,954
There is nothing out there, dear.

396
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:49,124
Who do you imagine
wants to attack children like yourself?

397
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,586
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe Lord Voldemort.

398
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:07,768
Now, let me make this quite plain.

399
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,770
You have been told...

400
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:15,317
...that a certain dark wizard
is at large once again.

401
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:20,614
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.

402
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:22,408
Detention, Mr. Potter.

403
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,743
Cedric Diggory dropped dead
of his own accord?

404
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,329
Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident.

405
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:29,665
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.

406
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:31,333
Enough!

407
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,669
Enough.

408
00:37:33,836 --> 00:37:38,173
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.

409
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,116
Come in.

410
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,290
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

411
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,208
Sit.

412
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:24,803
You're going to be doing some lines
for me today, Mr. Potter.

413
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,847
No, not with your quill.

414
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:30,267
Going to be using
a rather special one of mine.

415
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:36,815
Now...

416
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:43,655
...I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies."

417
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:47,618
How many times?

418
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:52,748
Well, let's say for as long as it takes
for the message to sink in.

419
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,418
You haven't given me any ink.

420
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:58,086
Oh, you won't need any ink.

421
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,806
Yes?

422
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:01,525
- Nothing.
- That's right.

423
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:06,405
Because you know, deep down...

424
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:08,657
...you deserve to be punished.

425
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:11,994
Don't you, Mr. Potter?

426
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:17,833
Go on.

427
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:29,136
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.

428
00:40:29,303 --> 00:40:30,929
Get out of class whenever you like.

429
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:34,850
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.

430
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:37,185
Care for another?

431
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,896
- I'm not asking you to write all of it.
- Please.

432
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:43,025
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

433
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,319
I'll do the introduction. That's all.

434
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:49,239
Hermione, you're honestly the most
wonderful person I've ever met.

435
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:53,660
- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.

436
00:40:58,707 --> 00:41:00,792
What's wrong with your hand?

437
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:02,794
Nothing.

438
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:05,964
The other hand.

439
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:10,302
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.

440
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:12,679
Dumbledore's got enough
on his mind right now.

441
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:14,973
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

442
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,559
Bloody hell, Harry.
The woman's torturing you.

443
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:21,688
- If the parents knew about this...
- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?

444
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:26,943
Harry, you've got to report this.

445
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,656
- It's perfectly simple. You're being--
- No, it's not.

446
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,659
Hermione, whatever this is,
it's not simple.

447
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,745
You don't understand.

448
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:41,249
Then help us to.

449
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,849
<i>Dear Padfoot...</i>

450
00:41:58,392 --> 00:42:00,102
<i>...I hope you're all right.</i>

451
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:04,898
<i>It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.</i>

452
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:12,280
<i>In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.</i>

453
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:16,451
<i>I know you, of all people,
will understand.</i>

454
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:52,738
Hello, Harry Potter.

455
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:59,995
- Your feet. Aren't they cold?
- Bit.

456
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:04,958
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

457
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,587
I suspect Nargles are behind it.

458
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:18,555
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.

459
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:24,311
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...

460
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,857
Different.

461
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:34,362
But why can't the others see them?

462
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:38,033
They can only be seen
by people who've seen death.

463
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,788
So you've known someone
who's died, then?

464
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,581
My mum.

465
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:50,045
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...

466
00:43:50,212 --> 00:43:53,507
...and one day,
one of her spells went badly wrong.

467
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:56,051
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.

468
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:58,845
Yes, it was rather horrible.

469
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:04,351
I do feel very sad about it sometimes,
but I've got Dad.

470
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:09,231
We both believe you, by the way.

471
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:15,278
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is back, and you fought him...

472
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:18,573
...and the Ministry and the <i>Prophet</i>
are conspiring against you.

473
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:23,078
Thanks. It seems you're about
the only ones that do.

474
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:24,579
I don't think that's true.

475
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:30,085
But I suppose
that's how he wants you to feel.

476
00:44:30,252 --> 00:44:32,045
What do you mean?

477
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:34,548
Well, if I were You-Know-Who...

478
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:38,593
...I'd want you to feel cut <i>off</i>
from everyone else...

479
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,471
...because if it's just you alone...

480
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:44,641
...you're not as much of a threat.

481
00:45:02,284 --> 00:45:07,038
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.

482
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:11,459
Harry.

483
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:14,546
Can I join you?

484
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:19,593
Pardon me, professor,
but what exactly are you insinuating?

485
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,512
I am merely requesting
that when it comes to my students...

486
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:26,975
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.

487
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:28,810
So silly of me, but it sounds...

488
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:33,106
...as if you're questioning my authority
in my own classroom...

489
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:34,608
...Minerva.

490
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:39,237
Not at all, Dolores,
merely your medieval methods.

491
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,990
I am sorry, dear.

492
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:45,493
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...

493
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,788
...and by extension,
the minister himself.

494
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:50,540
I am a tolerant woman...

495
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:55,795
...but the one thing
I will not stand for is disloyalty.

496
00:45:57,547 --> 00:45:59,341
Disloyalty.

497
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:05,013
Things at Hogwarts
are far worse than I feared.

498
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:08,683
Cornelius will want
to take immediate action.

499
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,988
What's happened to Dumbledore?

500
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:24,699
<i>Having already revolutionized...</i>

501
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:27,535
<i>...the teaching
of Defense Against the Dark Arts...</i>

502
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:32,707
<i>...Dolores Umbridge will,
as high inquisitor, have powers...</i>

503
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:39,381
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.

504
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:49,307
Just one question, dear.

505
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:53,687
You've been in this post
how long, exactly?

506
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:05,573
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

507
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,742
Yes.

508
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,787
But you were unsuccessful?

509
00:47:11,997 --> 00:47:14,416
Obviously.

510
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:50,201
Could you please predict something
for me?

511
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:53,121
I'm sorry?

512
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,587
Move those mouths.

513
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:09,804
One teensy little prophecy?

514
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:17,145
Pity.

515
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:20,106
No, wait. Wait, no.
I think I do see something.

516
00:48:20,273 --> 00:48:22,484
Yes, I do. Something dark.

517
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:27,280
You are in grave danger.

518
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,492
Lovely.

519
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,837
Cho. What's going on?

520
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:45,340
It's Professor Trelawney.

521
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:18,665
Sixteen years I've lived
and taught here.

522
00:49:18,832 --> 00:49:21,751
Hogwarts is my home.

523
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:25,547
You can't do this.

524
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:29,259
Actually, I can.

525
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:39,519
Something you'd like to say?

526
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:42,355
Oh, there are several things
I would like to say.

527
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:44,482
There...

528
00:49:58,413 --> 00:50:03,084
Professor McGonagall, might I ask you
to escort Sybil back inside?

529
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:06,838
Sybil, dear. This way.

530
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:08,506
Thank you.

531
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:13,720
Dumbledore, may I remind you
that under the terms...

532
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:17,140
...of Educational Decree Number 23,
as enacted by the minister--

533
00:50:17,307 --> 00:50:20,476
You have the right
to dismiss my teachers.

534
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:24,230
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

535
00:50:24,397 --> 00:50:27,442
That power remains
with the headmaster.

536
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:30,695
For now.

537
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:39,120
Don't you all have studying to do?

538
00:50:39,287 --> 00:50:40,455
Professor.

539
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:43,416
Professor?

540
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:46,669
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!

541
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:48,963
Professor Dumbledore.

542
00:50:59,641 --> 00:51:01,768
<i>That foul, evil, old gargoyle.</i>

543
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:04,479
We're not learning
how to defend ourselves.

544
00:51:04,646 --> 00:51:07,315
We're not learning
how to pass our OWLs.

545
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:09,734
She's taking over the entire school.

546
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:14,572
<i>Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.</i>

547
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:17,575
<i>Furthermore,
we have convincing evidence...</i>

548
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:20,620
<i>...that these disappearances
are the work...</i>

549
00:51:20,787 --> 00:51:24,165
<i>...of notorious
mass murderer Sirius Black.</i>

550
00:51:24,916 --> 00:51:26,501
Harry.

551
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,419
Sirius.

552
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,839
- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.

553
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:34,926
You said you were worried
about Umbridge. What's she doing?

554
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:37,011
Training you to kill half-breeds?

555
00:51:37,178 --> 00:51:40,181
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not surprised.

556
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:44,560
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.

557
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:45,770
Combat?

558
00:51:46,271 --> 00:51:49,190
What does he think,
we're forming some sort of wizard army?

559
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:50,733
That's exactly what he thinks.

560
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,862
That Dumbledore is assembling
his own forces to take on the Ministry.

561
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:58,700
He's becoming more paranoid
by the minute.

562
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:02,537
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...

563
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:05,873
...but things aren't going at all well
with the Order.

564
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,710
Fudge is blocking the truth
at every turn...

565
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:12,880
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

566
00:52:13,673 --> 00:52:17,010
Voldemort is on the move.

567
00:52:17,385 --> 00:52:18,803
Well, what can we do?

568
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:20,847
Someone's coming.

569
00:52:21,014 --> 00:52:23,224
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

570
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:28,396
But for now, at least,
it looks like you're on your own.

571
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:42,243
He really is out there, isn't he?

572
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:46,748
We've got to be able
to defend ourselves.

573
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:51,085
And if Umbridge refuses to teach us
how, we need someone who will.

574
00:53:08,102 --> 00:53:10,271
<i>Harry.</i>

575
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:22,241
This is mad.
Who'd wanna be taught by me?

576
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:23,618
I'm a nutter, remember?

577
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:28,289
Look on the bright side: you can't be
any worse than old toad face.

578
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:32,001
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.

579
00:53:32,502 --> 00:53:34,837
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?

580
00:53:35,004 --> 00:53:37,131
Just a couple of people.

581
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:43,596
Lovely spot.

582
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:49,435
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.

583
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:51,771
Matey, come back here.

584
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:01,364
Hi.

585
00:54:01,781 --> 00:54:04,659
So you all know why we're here.

586
00:54:04,826 --> 00:54:06,077
We need a teacher.

587
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:09,956
A proper teacher.

588
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:13,418
One who's had experience defending
themselves against the Dark Arts.

589
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:15,336
- Why?
- Why?

590
00:54:15,503 --> 00:54:17,588
Because You-Know-Who's back,
you toss pot.

591
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:19,340
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.

592
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:21,634
So Dumbledore says because he says.

593
00:54:21,801 --> 00:54:24,178
The point is, where's the proof?

594
00:54:25,555 --> 00:54:28,599
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...

595
00:54:31,686 --> 00:54:35,481
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.

596
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:39,068
Come on, Hermione. They're here
because they think I'm some freak.

597
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:41,863
Is it true you can produce
a Patronus Charm?

598
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,617
Yes.

599
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:49,537
I've seen it.

600
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:51,831
Blimey, Harry.
I didn't know you could do that.

601
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:56,627
And he killed a basilisk, with the sword
in Dumbledore's office.

602
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,045
It's true.

603
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:00,965
Third year, he fought off
about a hundred Dementors at once.

604
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:05,052
Last year, he really did fight off
You-Know-Who in the flesh.

605
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,554
Wait.

606
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:11,767
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...

607
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:15,521
...but the truth is,
most of that was just luck.

608
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:19,525
I didn't know what I was doing
half the time. I nearly always had help.

609
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:23,196
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.

610
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:30,411
Facing this stuff in real life
is not like school.

611
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:34,916
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.

612
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,584
But out there...

613
00:55:37,168 --> 00:55:40,463
...when you're a second away
from being murdered...

614
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:44,342
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...

615
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:48,930
You don't know what that's like.

616
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,608
You're right, Harry, we don't.

617
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,444
That's why we need your help.

618
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:06,531
Because if we're going to have
any chance at beating...

619
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:09,909
...Voldemort...

620
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:15,081
He's really back?

621
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:39,063
Right. First we need to find
a place to practice...

622
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,648
...where Umbridge won't find out.

623
00:56:40,815 --> 00:56:42,984
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.

624
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:46,112
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.

625
00:56:46,279 --> 00:56:48,364
Harry, what happens
if Umbridge does find out?

626
00:56:48,531 --> 00:56:49,699
Who cares?

627
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:55,162
I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it,
breaking the rules?

628
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,623
Who are you and what have you done
with Hermione?

629
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:02,003
Anyway, at least we know
one positive thing that came from today.

630
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,462
What's that?

631
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,842
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you,
could she?

632
00:57:10,595 --> 00:57:13,681
Right. Over the next few days,
we should each come up...

633
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:16,684
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.

634
00:57:16,851 --> 00:57:20,688
We've got to make sure, wherever it is,
there's no chance she can find us.

635
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:22,690
Will do, Harry.

636
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:35,536
<i>All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.</i>

637
00:57:35,703 --> 00:57:39,332
<i>Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.</i>

638
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,001
Watch where you're going,
Longbottom.

639
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:21,957
<i>You've done it, Neville.
You found the Room of Requirement.</i>

640
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:23,250
<i>The what?</i>

641
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:25,836
It's also known as
the Come and Go Room.

642
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:29,423
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.

643
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:32,259
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.

644
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:36,180
So say you really needed the toilet...

645
00:58:37,348 --> 00:58:42,186
Charming, Ronald.
But, yes, that is the general idea.

646
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:47,233
It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts
wants us to fight back.

647
00:58:58,285 --> 00:58:59,787
<i>Expelliarmus.</i>

648
00:59:04,917 --> 00:59:06,293
I'm hopeless.

649
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:10,256
You're just flourishing your wand
too much. Try it like this. <i>Expelliarmus.</i>

650
00:59:13,634 --> 00:59:17,638
You will please copy
the approved text four times...

651
00:59:17,805 --> 00:59:20,808
...to ensure maximum retention.

652
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:24,895
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.

653
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:27,106
- <i>Expelliarmus.</i>
- Wands away.

654
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:43,122
Stunning is one of the most useful spells
in your arsenal.

655
00:59:43,289 --> 00:59:45,499
It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.

656
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:49,253
So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.

657
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,178
<i>Stupefy!</i>

658
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:06,520
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.

659
01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:13,986
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.

660
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:16,363
Thanks, Ronald.

661
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:21,202
- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.

662
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:24,246
- You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.

663
01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:26,832
- One Sickle.
- You're on.

664
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:35,216
<i>Stupefy.</i>

665
01:00:40,888 --> 01:00:42,890
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

666
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:47,895
I let her do that.
It's good manners, isn't it?

667
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:52,650
It was completely intentional.

668
01:01:18,259 --> 01:01:21,220
Up you come.
Would you like a cup of tea?

669
01:01:23,514 --> 01:01:27,476
Now, focus on a fixed point
and try again.

670
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,020
<i>Expelliarmus.</i>

671
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:34,149
Very good. Keep your concentration.

672
01:01:36,277 --> 01:01:37,778
Great.

673
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,614
A little higher.

674
01:01:49,123 --> 01:01:51,959
I'm okay. I'm okay.

675
01:02:09,977 --> 01:02:12,605
<i>-Stupefy.
- Stupefy.</i>

676
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:17,526
<i>Those wishing to join
the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...</i>

677
01:02:17,693 --> 01:02:20,571
<i>...may sign up
in the high inquisitor's office.</i>

678
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:22,364
<i>Diminuendo.</i>

679
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:32,583
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:

680
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,960
Believing in yourself.

681
01:02:35,127 --> 01:02:37,254
<i>-Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus.</i> Got it.

682
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:39,006
Think of it this way.

683
01:02:39,173 --> 01:02:43,177
Every great wizard in history
has started out...

684
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:47,389
...as nothing more
than what we are now: students.

685
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:50,517
If they can do it, why not us?

686
01:03:00,653 --> 01:03:02,446
<i>-Stupefy.
- Expelliarmus.</i>

687
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:05,991
<i>Expelliarmus.</i>

688
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:10,204
<i>Expelliarmus.</i>

689
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,044
<i>Reducto.</i>

690
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:33,560
<i>-Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.</i>

691
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:36,063
<i>Expelliarmus.</i>

692
01:03:39,984 --> 01:03:42,069
<i>Expelliarmus.</i>

693
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:49,284
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.

694
01:03:50,911 --> 01:03:53,080
So that's it for this lesson.

695
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:56,625
Now, we're not gonna be meeting again
until after the holidays.

696
01:03:57,042 --> 01:04:00,087
So just keep practicing on your own
as best you can.

697
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:03,590
And well done, everyone.
Great, great work.

698
01:04:08,429 --> 01:04:09,847
Well done, mate.

699
01:04:10,014 --> 01:04:11,432
Thanks.

700
01:04:17,104 --> 01:04:19,481
See you after Christmas.

701
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:30,993
See you in the Common Room, Harry.

702
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:35,122
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.

703
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:36,790
Merry Christmas.

704
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:39,251
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.

705
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:42,087
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

706
01:04:42,254 --> 01:04:44,131
- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas.

707
01:04:44,298 --> 01:04:46,884
- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking.

708
01:04:47,051 --> 01:04:49,470
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.

709
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:52,306
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils--

710
01:04:52,473 --> 01:04:54,975
Sounds great, guys.
Would you excuse me?

711
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:10,657
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.

712
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:13,202
Yeah. I'm okay.

713
01:05:13,911 --> 01:05:16,705
Anyway, it's worth it.

714
01:05:22,044 --> 01:05:25,214
It's just, learning all this...

715
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:29,468
...makes me wonder whether,
if he'd known it...

716
01:05:29,635 --> 01:05:32,346
Cedric did know this stuff.

717
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:35,349
He was really good.

718
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:38,685
It's just, Voldemort was better.

719
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:45,025
You're a really good teacher, Harry.

720
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:49,196
I've never been able
to stun anything before.

721
01:05:58,372 --> 01:06:00,040
Mistletoe.

722
01:06:03,544 --> 01:06:05,462
Probably full of Nargles, though.

723
01:06:06,547 --> 01:06:08,215
What are Nargles?

724
01:06:08,924 --> 01:06:10,676
No idea.

725
01:06:32,698 --> 01:06:34,908
<i>Well, how was it?</i>

726
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:37,411
Wet.

727
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:39,580
I mean, she was sort of crying.

728
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:41,915
That bad at it, are you?

729
01:06:42,082 --> 01:06:44,835
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.

730
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:49,840
Cho spends half her time
crying these days.

731
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:52,259
You'd think a bit of snogging
would cheer her up.

732
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:56,597
Don't you understand
how she must be feeling?

733
01:07:01,018 --> 01:07:04,479
Well, obviously
she's feeling sad about Cedric...

734
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:07,733
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...

735
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:11,111
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...

736
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:15,032
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.

737
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:20,537
One person couldn't feel all that.
They'd explode.

738
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:23,957
Just because you've got
the emotional range of a teaspoon...

739
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:41,642
<i>Harry.</i>

740
01:07:50,192 --> 01:07:53,278
<i>Voldemort may be after something.</i>

741
01:07:53,946 --> 01:07:56,949
<i>Something he didn't have last time.</i>

742
01:07:57,783 --> 01:07:59,034
<i>Harry.</i>

743
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:01,954
<i>Harry.</i>

744
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:36,446
In the dream,
were you standing next to the victim...

745
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,115
...or looking down at the scene?

746
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:41,535
Neither. It was like I...

747
01:08:42,077 --> 01:08:44,204
Will you please just tell me
what's happening?

748
01:08:44,371 --> 01:08:46,707
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty
tonight.

749
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:49,293
Make sure he's found
by the right people.

750
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,044
- Sir.
- Phineas.

751
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:53,505
You must go to your portrait
at Grimmauld Place.

752
01:08:53,672 --> 01:08:56,300
Tell them that Arthur Weasley
is gravely injured...

753
01:08:56,466 --> 01:09:00,637
...and his children will be arriving there
soon by Portkey.

754
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:03,890
They've got him, Albus. It was close,
but they think he'll make it.

755
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:06,560
What's more,
the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.

756
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:08,645
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to--

757
01:09:08,812 --> 01:09:10,022
Look at me!

758
01:09:16,528 --> 01:09:18,739
What's happening to me?

759
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:28,498
You wished to see me, headmaster?

760
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:33,587
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait.
Not even till the morning.

761
01:09:33,962 --> 01:09:36,882
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.

762
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:43,263
It appears there's a connection...

763
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:45,766
...between the Dark Lord's mind
and your own.

764
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:50,103
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.

765
01:09:50,437 --> 01:09:53,482
Pray he remains ignorant.

766
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:56,943
You mean, if he knows about it, then...

767
01:09:57,402 --> 01:10:01,782
- ...he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...

768
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:03,825
...unhinge it.

769
01:10:03,992 --> 01:10:07,371
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...

770
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:09,790
...to invade the minds of his victims...

771
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:13,543
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.

772
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:19,466
Only after extracting the last exquisite
ounce of agony...

773
01:10:19,633 --> 01:10:23,929
...only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...

774
01:10:24,096 --> 01:10:25,305
...kill them.

775
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:28,725
Used properly,
the power of Occlumency...

776
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:32,396
...will help shield you
from access or influence.

777
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:37,317
In these lessons, I will attempt
to penetrate your mind.

778
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:40,987
You will attempt to resist.

779
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:42,739
Prepare yourself.

780
01:10:45,492 --> 01:10:46,701
<i>Legilimens.</i>

781
01:10:54,835 --> 01:10:58,422
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.

782
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:25,949
<i>Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.</i>

783
01:11:27,159 --> 01:11:29,828
Here we go.

784
01:11:29,995 --> 01:11:32,164
Daddy's back.

785
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:38,962
Sit down, everybody, sit down.
That's it. Now, presents.

786
01:11:39,129 --> 01:11:43,508
- And a nice big box for Ron.
- Big box for you. And...

787
01:11:46,303 --> 01:11:48,513
Fred and George. Come on, open up.

788
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,974
- I want to see your faces.
- Yes.

789
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:53,560
- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.

790
01:11:53,727 --> 01:11:58,023
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.

791
01:11:58,190 --> 01:12:01,067
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.

792
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:03,236
Oh, Harry, Harry.

793
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:05,322
There you are.

794
01:12:06,323 --> 01:12:08,158
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.

795
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:10,577
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.

796
01:12:10,744 --> 01:12:12,746
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.

797
01:12:12,913 --> 01:12:14,623
- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?

798
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:16,166
Fred? George?

799
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:18,877
- Hermione.
- A Christmas toast.

800
01:12:19,044 --> 01:12:20,921
To Mr. Harry Potter...

801
01:12:21,922 --> 01:12:24,758
...without whom I would not be here.

802
01:12:28,345 --> 01:12:30,680
- Harry.
- Harry.

803
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:32,098
Harry.

804
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:35,685
That is delicious.
I shall be needing some more of that.

805
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:38,230
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.

806
01:12:39,147 --> 01:12:41,900
I can't understand
why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.

807
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,195
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.

808
01:12:45,362 --> 01:12:47,197
No more than usual, Ron.

809
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:49,241
I don't know why...

810
01:12:55,247 --> 01:12:59,834
Nasty brat, standing there
as bold as brass.

811
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:04,756
Harry Potter,
the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.

812
01:13:04,923 --> 01:13:07,926
Friend of Mudbloods
and blood-traitors alike.

813
01:13:08,343 --> 01:13:10,971
- If my poor mistress only knew...
- Kreacher!

814
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:13,974
That's enough of your bile.
Away with you!

815
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,142
Of course, master.

816
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:20,981
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.

817
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:25,193
Sorry about that.

818
01:13:25,777 --> 01:13:29,447
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.

819
01:13:29,781 --> 01:13:31,866
Not to me, anyway.

820
01:13:32,701 --> 01:13:34,661
What, you grew up here?

821
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:37,080
This is my parents' house.

822
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:41,251
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.

823
01:13:42,377 --> 01:13:45,672
About the only useful thing
I've been able to do.

824
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:49,426
This is the Black family tree.

825
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:52,470
My deranged cousin.

826
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:55,348
I hated the lot of them.

827
01:13:55,515 --> 01:14:00,228
My parents with their pure-blood mania.

828
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:07,235
My mother did that after I ran away.

829
01:14:09,571 --> 01:14:11,448
Charming woman.

830
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:14,367
I was 16.

831
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:16,620
Where did you go?

832
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:19,956
Round your dad's.

833
01:14:21,458 --> 01:14:24,002
I was always welcome at the Potters'.

834
01:14:24,878 --> 01:14:27,631
I see him so much in you, Harry.

835
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:30,467
You are so very much alike.

836
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:33,386
I'm not so sure.

837
01:14:34,429 --> 01:14:35,889
Sirius, when I was...

838
01:14:38,725 --> 01:14:43,229
When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked,
I wasn't just watching.

839
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:45,899
I was the snake.

840
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:49,694
And afterwards,
in Dumbledore's office...

841
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:54,074
...there was a moment
when I wanted to--

842
01:14:59,204 --> 01:15:02,082
This connection
between me and Voldemort.

843
01:15:02,749 --> 01:15:06,336
What if the reason for it
is that I am becoming more like him?

844
01:15:07,671 --> 01:15:12,592
I just feel so angry all the time.

845
01:15:12,759 --> 01:15:17,305
And what if, after everything
that I've been through...

846
01:15:17,472 --> 01:15:21,059
...something's gone wrong inside me?
What if I'm becoming bad?

847
01:15:23,687 --> 01:15:26,940
I want you to listen to me
very carefully, Harry.

848
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:31,111
You're not a bad person.

849
01:15:31,945 --> 01:15:36,282
You're a very good person
who bad things have happened to.

850
01:15:36,908 --> 01:15:38,034
You understand?

851
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:45,166
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.

852
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:49,796
We've all got both light and dark
inside of us.

853
01:15:50,547 --> 01:15:53,800
What matters
is the part we choose to act on.

854
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,054
That's who we really are.

855
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:03,560
Harry, time to go.

856
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:09,607
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.

857
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:11,359
You'll see.

858
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:13,862
Come on.

859
01:16:51,316 --> 01:16:52,484
Really?

860
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:55,278
Harry. Harry.

861
01:16:55,445 --> 01:16:57,363
Hagrid's back.

862
01:17:00,325 --> 01:17:02,160
I'm sorry.

863
01:17:16,382 --> 01:17:19,552
I will say this one last time.

864
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:22,222
I'm ordering you to tell me
where you've been.

865
01:17:22,388 --> 01:17:25,391
I told you. I've been away
for me health.

866
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:29,896
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.

867
01:17:30,063 --> 01:17:34,901
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper,
fresh air must be difficult to come by.

868
01:17:36,945 --> 01:17:39,447
If I were you,
I shouldn't get too used to being back.

869
01:17:39,614 --> 01:17:42,909
In fact, I mightn't bother
unpacking at all.

870
01:18:01,845 --> 01:18:04,931
This is top-secret, right?

871
01:18:05,849 --> 01:18:08,226
Dumbledore sent me
to parley with the giants.

872
01:18:08,393 --> 01:18:09,894
Giants?

873
01:18:11,104 --> 01:18:12,146
You found them?

874
01:18:12,313 --> 01:18:16,192
Well, they're not that hard to find, to be
perfectly honest. They're so big, see?

875
01:18:17,068 --> 01:18:20,113
I tried to convince them
to join the cause.

876
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,949
But I wasn't the only one
that was trying to win them over.

877
01:18:23,658 --> 01:18:25,577
- Death Eaters?
- Yes.

878
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:29,372
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.

879
01:18:29,873 --> 01:18:32,250
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.

880
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:36,504
Suppose some of them remember
he was friendly to them. I suppose.

881
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:41,426
And they did this to you?

882
01:18:42,135 --> 01:18:43,887
Not exactly, no.

883
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:48,308
Oh, go on, you have it, then,
you dozy dog.

884
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:04,407
It's changing out there.

885
01:19:04,824 --> 01:19:06,409
Just like last time.

886
01:19:07,869 --> 01:19:09,495
There's a storm coming, Harry.

887
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:13,333
We'd all best be ready when she does.

888
01:19:50,328 --> 01:19:53,373
<i>We have confirmed
that 10 high-security prisoners...</i>

889
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:56,376
<i>...in the early hours of yesterday evening
did escape.</i>

890
01:19:56,542 --> 01:20:00,213
<i>And of course, the Muggle prime minister
has been alerted to the danger.</i>

891
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,465
<i>We strongly suspect...</i>

892
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:05,301
...that the breakout was engineered...

893
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:09,681
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...

894
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:14,060
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...

895
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:19,899
<i>...cousin of escapee
Bellatrix Lestrange.</i>

896
01:20:30,201 --> 01:20:32,495
Dumbledore warned Fudge
this could happen.

897
01:20:32,662 --> 01:20:35,832
He's gonna get us all killed
just because he can't face the truth.

898
01:20:35,999 --> 01:20:37,125
Harry.

899
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:42,839
I wanted to apologize.

900
01:20:43,423 --> 01:20:47,593
Now even me mum says the <i>Prophet's</i>
version of things don't add up.

901
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:53,683
So, what I'm really trying to say
is that I believe you.

902
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:02,233
Neville?

903
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:16,956
Fourteen years ago...

904
01:21:17,123 --> 01:21:21,377
...a Death Eater
named Bellatrix Lestrange...

905
01:21:21,544 --> 01:21:24,756
...used a Cruciatus Curse
on my parents.

906
01:21:25,298 --> 01:21:29,302
She tortured them for information...

907
01:21:29,469 --> 01:21:31,637
...but they never gave in.

908
01:21:33,306 --> 01:21:35,808
I'm quite proud to be their son.

909
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:40,646
But I'm not sure I'm ready
for everyone to know just yet.

910
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:50,698
We're gonna make them proud, Neville.
That's a promise.

911
01:21:54,952 --> 01:21:58,664
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.

912
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:02,251
Allow it to fill you up.
Keep trying, Seamus.

913
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:03,836
George, your turn now.

914
01:22:05,171 --> 01:22:07,507
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

915
01:22:08,424 --> 01:22:11,844
A full-bodied Patronus
is the most difficult to produce...

916
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:15,848
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.

917
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:17,266
Wow, that was really good.

918
01:22:17,975 --> 01:22:19,519
Fantastic, Ginny.

919
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:23,731
Just remember, your Patronus can only
protect you for as long as you stay focused.

920
01:22:23,898 --> 01:22:26,192
So focus, Luna.

921
01:22:29,904 --> 01:22:31,614
Think of the happiest thing you can.

922
01:22:31,781 --> 01:22:33,741
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

923
01:22:33,908 --> 01:22:36,786
- I'm trying.
- I know. It's good.

924
01:22:36,953 --> 01:22:41,207
This is really advanced stuff, guys.
You're doing so well.

925
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:44,377
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

926
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:28,754
I'll make short work of this.

927
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:32,091
<i>Bombarda Maxima.</i>

928
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,736
Get them.

929
01:23:52,153 --> 01:23:53,613
Been watching them for weeks.

930
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:55,740
And see, "Dumbledore's Army"...

931
01:23:56,157 --> 01:23:59,869
...proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.

932
01:24:01,204 --> 01:24:03,289
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...

933
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,999
...never fooled us for a minute.

934
01:24:05,166 --> 01:24:07,251
We saw your lies for what they were:

935
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:11,214
A smokescreen for your bid
to seize control of the Ministry.

936
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,423
Naturally.

937
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:15,134
No, professor.
He had nothing to do with it. It was me.

938
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:18,971
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me,
but as has been pointed out...

939
01:24:19,138 --> 01:24:23,976
...the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."

940
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:26,771
I instructed Harry
to form this organization.

941
01:24:26,938 --> 01:24:30,399
And I, and I alone,
am responsible for its activities.

942
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:32,401
Dispatch an owl to the <i>Daily Prophet.</i>

943
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:35,112
If we hurry, we should still make
the morning edition.

944
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:40,076
Dawlish, Shacklebolt,
you will escort Dumbledore...

945
01:24:40,243 --> 01:24:41,661
...to Azkaban...

946
01:24:42,912 --> 01:24:48,084
...to await trial
for conspiracy and sedition.

947
01:24:48,251 --> 01:24:51,170
I thought we might hit this little snag.

948
01:24:52,338 --> 01:24:55,800
You seem to be laboring
under the delusion that I'm going to--

949
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:57,802
What was the phrase?

950
01:24:57,969 --> 01:24:59,553
- -Come quietly.

951
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,430
Well, I can tell you this:

952
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:04,183
I have no intention
of going to Azkaban.

953
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:05,601
Enough of this.

954
01:25:06,102 --> 01:25:07,186
Take him.

955
01:25:20,032 --> 01:25:24,412
Well, you may not like him, minister...

956
01:25:24,578 --> 01:25:26,706
...but you can't deny...

957
01:25:27,248 --> 01:25:30,001
...Dumbledore has got style.

958
01:25:54,191 --> 01:25:58,738
<i>Boys and girls are not permitted
to be within eight inches of each other.</i>

959
01:25:58,904 --> 01:26:02,325
<i>Those wishing to join
the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...</i>

960
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:07,538
<i>Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.</i>

961
01:26:07,705 --> 01:26:12,001
<i>Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.</i>

962
01:27:23,197 --> 01:27:24,824
Harry.

963
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:35,167
You did everything you could.
No one could win against that old hag.

964
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:37,670
Even Dumbledore
didn't see this coming.

965
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:40,756
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.

966
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:43,008
Yeah, we talked you into it.

967
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:45,177
Yeah, but I agreed.

968
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:49,849
I tried so hard to help,
and all it's done is make things worse.

969
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:54,353
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.

970
01:27:55,396 --> 01:27:59,608
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.

971
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:02,445
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.

972
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:05,781
- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?

973
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:09,952
To go it alone.

974
01:28:16,292 --> 01:28:17,960
Hagrid.

975
01:28:21,714 --> 01:28:24,133
Any idea where he's taking us?

976
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:27,386
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?

977
01:28:35,686 --> 01:28:38,355
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.

978
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:41,066
And they're dangerous
at the best of times.

979
01:28:42,026 --> 01:28:44,361
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...

980
01:28:44,528 --> 01:28:46,739
...they'll have a full uprising
on their hands.

981
01:28:46,906 --> 01:28:48,574
Hagrid, what's going on?

982
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:50,951
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.

983
01:28:51,118 --> 01:28:56,081
I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it,
but with Dumbledore gone...

984
01:28:56,749 --> 01:28:59,919
...I'll likely be getting the sack
any day now.

985
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:03,589
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.

986
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,428
Grawpy.

987
01:29:11,805 --> 01:29:13,933
Down here, you great buffoon.

988
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:21,941
Grawpy.

989
01:29:22,733 --> 01:29:24,443
Brought you some company.

990
01:29:36,789 --> 01:29:39,041
I couldn't just leave him, because--

991
01:29:39,208 --> 01:29:40,960
Because he's my brother.

992
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:42,253
Blimey.

993
01:29:42,419 --> 01:29:44,463
Well, half brother, really.

994
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:49,885
He's completely harmless, just like I said.
Little high-spirited, is all.

995
01:29:52,012 --> 01:29:54,348
- Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.

996
01:29:54,515 --> 01:29:56,934
We talked about this.
You do not grab, do you?

997
01:29:57,101 --> 01:29:59,353
That's your new friend, Hermione.

998
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,813
Grawpy.

999
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:06,318
Grawp.

1000
01:30:08,362 --> 01:30:11,448
Put me down.

1001
01:30:15,119 --> 01:30:16,662
Now.

1002
01:30:28,841 --> 01:30:29,925
You all right?

1003
01:30:31,218 --> 01:30:32,886
Fine.

1004
01:30:33,304 --> 01:30:35,598
Just needs a firm hand, is all.

1005
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:38,183
I think you've got an admirer.

1006
01:30:40,686 --> 01:30:42,855
You just stay away from her, all right?

1007
01:31:12,968 --> 01:31:15,721
He gets his own food and all.

1008
01:31:16,972 --> 01:31:20,059
It's company he'll be needing
when I'm gone.

1009
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:23,604
You will look after him, won't you?

1010
01:31:24,104 --> 01:31:26,815
I'm the only family he's got.

1011
01:31:40,412 --> 01:31:42,247
Feeling sentimental?

1012
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:49,380
- That's private.
- Not to me.

1013
01:31:49,672 --> 01:31:53,175
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.

1014
01:31:55,594 --> 01:31:58,764
Every memory he has access to
is a weapon he can use against you.

1015
01:31:58,931 --> 01:32:03,102
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.

1016
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:06,522
You're just like your father.

1017
01:32:06,689 --> 01:32:08,482
Lazy, arrogant.

1018
01:32:08,649 --> 01:32:10,901
- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.

1019
01:32:11,068 --> 01:32:13,237
- I'm not weak.
- Then prove it.

1020
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:15,781
Control your emotions.

1021
01:32:15,948 --> 01:32:18,909
Discipline your mind.

1022
01:32:21,745 --> 01:32:22,955
<i>Legilimens.</i>

1023
01:32:30,129 --> 01:32:31,255
<i>Harry.</i>

1024
01:32:31,422 --> 01:32:33,132
Sirius.

1025
01:32:33,799 --> 01:32:35,134
<i>I may vomit.</i>

1026
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:36,510
Stop it.

1027
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:39,930
Is this what you call control?

1028
01:32:40,431 --> 01:32:43,475
We've been at it for hours.
If I could just rest.

1029
01:32:43,642 --> 01:32:47,062
The Dark Lord isn't resting.

1030
01:32:48,689 --> 01:32:50,607
You and Black, you're two of a kind.

1031
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:54,737
Sentimental children forever whining
about how unfair your lives have been.

1032
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:58,282
Well, it may have escaped your notice,
but life isn't fair.

1033
01:32:58,449 --> 01:33:02,411
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.

1034
01:33:02,578 --> 01:33:05,622
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.

1035
01:33:06,665 --> 01:33:08,167
<i>- Legilimens.
- Protego.</i>

1036
01:33:13,714 --> 01:33:15,257
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.

1037
01:33:15,424 --> 01:33:17,509
Snape. <i>Expelliarmus.</i>

1038
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:19,511
Nice one, James.

1039
01:33:19,845 --> 01:33:22,181
- Dad.
- <i>impedimenta.</i>

1040
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:24,349
<i>Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.</i>

1041
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:27,186
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?

1042
01:33:27,352 --> 01:33:29,605
<i>Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.</i>

1043
01:33:29,772 --> 01:33:30,981
<i>Enough.</i>

1044
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:34,526
Enough.

1045
01:33:43,035 --> 01:33:45,662
Your lessons are at an end.

1046
01:33:45,829 --> 01:33:46,955
I--

1047
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:50,375
Get out.

1048
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:09,770
- What's your name?
- Michael.

1049
01:34:09,937 --> 01:34:11,855
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.

1050
01:34:12,022 --> 01:34:15,067
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?

1051
01:34:15,234 --> 01:34:17,236
It's fading already.

1052
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:22,157
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.

1053
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:32,251
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...

1054
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:36,213
...naughty children
deserve to be punished.

1055
01:34:39,258 --> 01:34:40,592
You know, George...

1056
01:34:40,759 --> 01:34:44,429
...I've always felt our futures lay outside
the world of academic achievement.

1057
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:49,184
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.

1058
01:36:01,131 --> 01:36:02,799
All right, professor!

1059
01:36:11,558 --> 01:36:13,352
Here you go.

1060
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:40,128
Ready when you are.

1061
01:38:05,881 --> 01:38:09,134
I need that prophecy.

1062
01:38:09,301 --> 01:38:11,136
You'll have to kill me.

1063
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:16,558
Oh, I will.
But first, you will fetch it for me.

1064
01:38:16,725 --> 01:38:18,435
<i>Crucio.</i>

1065
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:22,731
<i>Crucio.</i>

1066
01:38:34,117 --> 01:38:35,577
Sirius.

1067
01:38:35,744 --> 01:38:36,787
Harry, are you sure?

1068
01:38:36,953 --> 01:38:39,372
I saw it. It's just like
with Mr. Weasley.

1069
01:38:39,539 --> 01:38:41,416
It's the door I've been dreaming about.

1070
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:43,668
I couldn't remember
where I'd seen it before.

1071
01:38:43,835 --> 01:38:45,754
Sirius said Voldemort
was after something.

1072
01:38:45,921 --> 01:38:49,216
Something he didn't have the last time,
in the Department of Mysteries.

1073
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:51,343
Harry, please, just listen.

1074
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:54,846
What if Voldemort
meant for you to see this?

1075
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:59,267
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?

1076
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:02,938
What if he is?
I'm supposed to just let him die?

1077
01:39:03,105 --> 01:39:06,608
Hermione,
he's the only family I've got left.

1078
01:39:09,152 --> 01:39:10,195
What do we do?

1079
01:39:11,613 --> 01:39:13,240
We'll have to use the Floo Network.

1080
01:39:13,406 --> 01:39:15,492
Umbridge has the chimneys
under surveillance.

1081
01:39:15,659 --> 01:39:17,202
Not all of them.

1082
01:39:20,038 --> 01:39:21,373
<i>Alohomora.</i>

1083
01:39:32,592 --> 01:39:34,302
Alert the Order if you can.

1084
01:39:34,469 --> 01:39:38,056
- Are you mental? We're going with you.
- It's too dangerous.

1085
01:39:38,223 --> 01:39:41,852
When are you going to get it
into your head? We're in this together.

1086
01:39:42,018 --> 01:39:45,230
That you are.

1087
01:39:45,397 --> 01:39:48,275
Caught this one
trying to help the Weasley girl.

1088
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:55,407
You were going to Dumbledore,
weren't you?

1089
01:39:55,574 --> 01:39:57,576
- No.
- Liar.

1090
01:39:57,742 --> 01:40:00,579
- You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.

1091
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:04,249
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.

1092
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:06,209
Have you brought the Veritaserum?

1093
01:40:06,376 --> 01:40:09,254
I'm afraid you've used up
all my stores interrogating students.

1094
01:40:09,421 --> 01:40:12,591
The last of it on Miss Chang.

1095
01:40:16,595 --> 01:40:18,096
Unless you wish to poison him--

1096
01:40:18,263 --> 01:40:22,726
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.

1097
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:25,270
- -I cannot help you.

1098
01:40:27,689 --> 01:40:29,399
He's got Padfoot.

1099
01:40:30,442 --> 01:40:33,945
He's got Padfoot at the place
where it's hidden.

1100
01:40:34,404 --> 01:40:36,531
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?

1101
01:40:36,698 --> 01:40:38,241
What is he talking about, Snape?

1102
01:40:44,915 --> 01:40:46,917
No idea.

1103
01:40:51,421 --> 01:40:52,964
Very well.

1104
01:40:53,965 --> 01:40:56,301
You give me no choice, Potter.

1105
01:40:56,676 --> 01:40:59,638
As this is an issue
of Ministry security...

1106
01:40:59,804 --> 01:41:01,890
...you leave me with...

1107
01:41:02,641 --> 01:41:04,601
...no alternative.

1108
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:07,604
The Cruciatus Curse
ought to loosen your tongue.

1109
01:41:07,771 --> 01:41:08,813
That's illegal.

1110
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:12,317
What Cornelius doesn't know
won't hurt him.

1111
01:41:19,824 --> 01:41:21,326
Tell her, Harry!

1112
01:41:22,827 --> 01:41:24,287
Tell me what?

1113
01:41:25,497 --> 01:41:27,499
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...

1114
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:29,918
...I will.

1115
01:41:31,544 --> 01:41:33,338
Where what is?

1116
01:41:34,547 --> 01:41:36,841
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

1117
01:41:41,846 --> 01:41:43,390
How much further?

1118
01:41:43,556 --> 01:41:45,225
Not far.

1119
01:41:47,227 --> 01:41:50,939
It had to be somewhere
students wouldn't find it accidentally.

1120
01:41:55,277 --> 01:41:56,736
What are you doing?

1121
01:41:56,903 --> 01:41:58,697
Improvising.

1122
01:42:07,205 --> 01:42:08,832
Well?

1123
01:42:10,125 --> 01:42:12,252
Where is this weapon?

1124
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:19,426
There isn't one, is there?

1125
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:24,389
You were trying to trick me.

1126
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:30,145
You know...

1127
01:42:31,563 --> 01:42:33,565
...I really hate children.

1128
01:42:49,164 --> 01:42:53,585
You have no business here, centaur.
This is a Ministry matter.

1129
01:42:56,254 --> 01:42:57,922
Lower your weapons.

1130
01:42:58,089 --> 01:43:03,636
I warn you, under the law, as
creatures of near-human intelligence...

1131
01:43:03,803 --> 01:43:05,055
<i>Protego.</i>

1132
01:43:05,305 --> 01:43:06,431
How dare you?

1133
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:08,600
Filthy half-breed.

1134
01:43:09,351 --> 01:43:10,393
<i>Incarcerous.</i>

1135
01:43:23,615 --> 01:43:26,201
Please. Please stop it. Please.

1136
01:43:26,368 --> 01:43:31,039
Now, enough. I will have order.

1137
01:43:39,881 --> 01:43:42,467
You filthy animal.

1138
01:43:42,634 --> 01:43:45,595
Do you know who I am?

1139
01:43:45,762 --> 01:43:48,598
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.

1140
01:43:48,765 --> 01:43:50,642
No, he doesn't understand.

1141
01:43:58,316 --> 01:44:01,778
Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.

1142
01:44:01,945 --> 01:44:03,863
I'm sorry, professor.

1143
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:05,824
But I must not tell lies.

1144
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:07,033
What are you doing?

1145
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:10,995
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.

1146
01:44:11,496 --> 01:44:13,665
Let me go!

1147
01:44:16,334 --> 01:44:18,169
Thank you, Grawp.

1148
01:44:18,336 --> 01:44:21,840
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.

1149
01:44:30,098 --> 01:44:33,685
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.

1150
01:44:33,852 --> 01:44:35,979
Told them I was hungry,
wanted some sweets.

1151
01:44:36,146 --> 01:44:38,690
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.

1152
01:44:39,524 --> 01:44:41,025
That was clever, Ron.

1153
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:44,362
- Has been known to happen.
- It was brilliant.

1154
01:44:44,529 --> 01:44:46,364
So how are we getting to London?

1155
01:44:47,699 --> 01:44:51,244
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...

1156
01:44:52,078 --> 01:44:54,789
...but I've got you
into enough trouble as it is.

1157
01:44:54,956 --> 01:44:57,917
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be
about doing something real.

1158
01:44:58,251 --> 01:45:00,378
Or was that all just words to you?

1159
01:45:02,255 --> 01:45:05,467
Maybe you don't have to do this
all by yourself, mate.

1160
01:45:10,388 --> 01:45:12,557
So how are we going to get to London?

1161
01:45:13,933 --> 01:45:16,186
We fly, of course.

1162
01:46:07,237 --> 01:46:09,405
<i>Department of Mysteries.</i>

1163
01:46:18,248 --> 01:46:19,958
This is it.

1164
01:47:12,927 --> 01:47:15,263
Ninety-two. Ninety-three.

1165
01:47:16,973 --> 01:47:18,349
Ninety-four.

1166
01:47:19,601 --> 01:47:20,643
Ninety-five.

1167
01:47:33,197 --> 01:47:35,950
- He should be here.
- Harry.

1168
01:47:38,661 --> 01:47:39,954
It's got your name on it.

1169
01:48:05,146 --> 01:48:09,525
<i>The one with the power
to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.</i>

1170
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:12,779
<i>And the Dark Lord
shall mark him as his equal...</i>

1171
01:48:12,945 --> 01:48:15,740
<i>...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.</i>

1172
01:48:21,412 --> 01:48:26,751
<i>For neither can live
while the other survives.</i>

1173
01:48:29,253 --> 01:48:30,380
Harry.

1174
01:48:40,848 --> 01:48:42,350
Where's Sirius?

1175
01:48:42,517 --> 01:48:47,605
You know, you really should learn
to tell the difference between dreams...

1176
01:48:50,525 --> 01:48:52,694
...and reality.

1177
01:48:53,945 --> 01:48:58,908
You saw only what the Dark Lord
wanted you to see.

1178
01:48:59,617 --> 01:49:01,119
Now, hand me the prophecy.

1179
01:49:01,285 --> 01:49:03,371
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.

1180
01:49:06,124 --> 01:49:08,710
He knows how to play.

1181
01:49:08,876 --> 01:49:12,672
Itty, bitty baby.

1182
01:49:12,839 --> 01:49:14,090
Potter.

1183
01:49:14,632 --> 01:49:16,509
Bellatrix Lestrange.

1184
01:49:16,676 --> 01:49:19,637
Neville Longbottom, is it?
How's Mum and Dad?

1185
01:49:19,804 --> 01:49:21,639
Better, now they're
about to be avenged.

1186
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:29,313
Now, let's everybody
just calm down...

1187
01:49:29,772 --> 01:49:31,274
...shall we?

1188
01:49:31,441 --> 01:49:33,901
All we want is that prophecy.

1189
01:49:34,068 --> 01:49:36,279
Why did Voldemort
need me to come and get this?

1190
01:49:36,446 --> 01:49:38,072
You dare speak his name?

1191
01:49:39,615 --> 01:49:41,200
You filthy half-blood!

1192
01:49:41,367 --> 01:49:43,995
It's all right.
He's just a curious lad, aren't you?

1193
01:49:45,913 --> 01:49:51,377
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.

1194
01:49:51,544 --> 01:49:54,297
Which is lucky for you, really.

1195
01:49:58,050 --> 01:50:00,011
Haven't you always wondered...

1196
01:50:00,511 --> 01:50:05,683
...the reason for the connection
between you and the Dark Lord?

1197
01:50:06,434 --> 01:50:08,936
Why he was unable to kill you...

1198
01:50:09,103 --> 01:50:11,647
...when you were just an infant?

1199
01:50:13,024 --> 01:50:17,820
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?

1200
01:50:18,738 --> 01:50:23,159
All the answers are there, Potter,
in your hand.

1201
01:50:24,368 --> 01:50:26,370
All you have to do...

1202
01:50:26,913 --> 01:50:28,873
...is give it to me.

1203
01:50:29,165 --> 01:50:32,460
Then I can show you everything.

1204
01:50:41,219 --> 01:50:43,012
I've waited 14 years.

1205
01:50:43,596 --> 01:50:44,889
I know.

1206
01:50:46,224 --> 01:50:49,143
I guess I can wait a little longer.
Now. <i>Stupefy.</i>

1207
01:50:49,310 --> 01:50:50,728
<i>Stupefy.</i>

1208
01:51:06,869 --> 01:51:07,912
<i>Levicorpus.</i>

1209
01:51:14,418 --> 01:51:16,462
<i>Petrificus Totalus.</i>

1210
01:51:16,629 --> 01:51:18,422
Well done, Neville.

1211
01:51:26,889 --> 01:51:28,432
<i>Stupefy.</i>

1212
01:51:30,184 --> 01:51:31,435
<i>-Stupefy.
- Stupefy.</i>

1213
01:51:42,572 --> 01:51:44,448
<i>Stupefy.</i>

1214
01:51:51,998 --> 01:51:54,292
<i>Reducto.</i>

1215
01:52:10,308 --> 01:52:12,435
Get back to the door.

1216
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:52,224
Department of Mysteries.
They got that bit right, didn't they?

1217
01:52:57,438 --> 01:52:59,357
The voices.

1218
01:52:59,899 --> 01:53:01,943
Can you tell what they're saying?

1219
01:53:03,611 --> 01:53:05,780
There aren't any voices, Harry.

1220
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:08,282
Let's get out of here.

1221
01:53:08,449 --> 01:53:10,034
I hear them too.

1222
01:53:13,162 --> 01:53:15,790
Harry, it's just an empty archway.

1223
01:53:18,542 --> 01:53:19,961
Please, Harry.

1224
01:53:20,711 --> 01:53:22,588
Get behind me.

1225
01:54:09,135 --> 01:54:11,846
Did you actually believe...

1226
01:54:12,013 --> 01:54:16,600
...or were you truly naive enough
to think...

1227
01:54:17,226 --> 01:54:22,356
...that children stood a chance
against us?

1228
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:29,613
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.

1229
01:54:33,284 --> 01:54:36,620
Give me the prophecy now...

1230
01:54:36,787 --> 01:54:40,791
...or watch your friends die.

1231
01:54:53,721 --> 01:54:55,139
Don't give it to him, Harry.

1232
01:55:21,415 --> 01:55:24,168
Get away from my godson.

1233
01:55:54,281 --> 01:55:56,867
Now, listen to me.
Take the others and get out of here.

1234
01:55:57,201 --> 01:55:59,036
What? No, I'm staying with you.

1235
01:55:59,203 --> 01:56:02,039
You've done beautifully.

1236
01:56:02,706 --> 01:56:04,333
Now, let me take it from here.

1237
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:05,543
Black.

1238
01:56:32,695 --> 01:56:34,029
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1239
01:56:34,196 --> 01:56:35,531
Nice one, James.

1240
01:56:42,746 --> 01:56:44,248
<i>Avada Kedavra.</i>

1241
01:57:04,435 --> 01:57:06,770
<i>No. No.</i>

1242
01:57:30,794 --> 01:57:33,380
I killed Sirius Black.

1243
01:57:34,340 --> 01:57:36,300
- You coming to get me?
- <i>Crucio.</i>

1244
01:57:48,646 --> 01:57:51,815
<i>You've got to mean it, Harry.</i>

1245
01:57:51,982 --> 01:57:55,736
<i>She killed him. She deserves it.</i>

1246
01:57:59,573 --> 01:58:02,785
<i>You know the spell, Harry.</i>

1247
01:58:14,338 --> 01:58:15,965
Do it.

1248
01:58:23,639 --> 01:58:26,600
So weak.

1249
01:58:33,357 --> 01:58:36,568
It was foolish of you
to come here tonight, Tom.

1250
01:58:36,735 --> 01:58:38,487
The Aurors are on their way.

1251
01:58:38,654 --> 01:58:42,866
By which time I shall be gone,
and you...

1252
01:58:44,368 --> 01:58:46,495
...shall be dead.

1253
02:01:00,796 --> 02:01:02,673
You've lost, old man.

1254
02:01:22,818 --> 02:01:23,861
Harry.

1255
02:01:27,990 --> 02:01:29,491
<i>So weak.</i>

1256
02:01:29,992 --> 02:01:32,202
<i>So vulnerable.</i>

1257
02:01:36,498 --> 02:01:37,541
Look at me.

1258
02:01:40,043 --> 02:01:44,298
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.

1259
02:01:44,465 --> 02:01:46,967
It's how you are not.

1260
02:01:51,889 --> 02:01:53,390
Harry?

1261
02:02:25,797 --> 02:02:27,257
You're the weak one...

1262
02:02:27,883 --> 02:02:32,012
...and you'll never know
love or friendship.

1263
02:02:35,432 --> 02:02:38,310
And I feel sorry for you.

1264
02:03:01,375 --> 02:03:04,836
You're a fool, Harry Potter.

1265
02:03:05,796 --> 02:03:10,926
And you will lose everything.

1266
02:03:25,857 --> 02:03:27,526
He's back.

1267
02:04:35,260 --> 02:04:36,928
I know how you feel, Harry.

1268
02:04:37,095 --> 02:04:38,722
No, you don't.

1269
02:04:44,353 --> 02:04:45,729
It's my fault.

1270
02:04:45,896 --> 02:04:49,191
No, the fault is mine.

1271
02:04:50,192 --> 02:04:51,943
I knew it was only a matter of time...

1272
02:04:52,110 --> 02:04:55,197
...before Voldemort made the connection
between you.

1273
02:04:55,989 --> 02:05:00,243
I thought by distancing myself from you,
as I have done all year...

1274
02:05:00,410 --> 02:05:05,666
...he'd be less tempted, and therefore
you might be more protected.

1275
02:05:08,460 --> 02:05:11,797
The prophecy said:

1276
02:05:12,422 --> 02:05:16,385
"Neither one can live
while the other one survives."

1277
02:05:17,719 --> 02:05:23,767
It means one of us is gonna
have to kill the other, in the end.

1278
02:05:25,769 --> 02:05:27,354
Yes.

1279
02:05:27,813 --> 02:05:29,398
Why didn't you tell me?

1280
02:05:29,564 --> 02:05:33,151
For the same reason
you tried to save Sirius.

1281
02:05:33,318 --> 02:05:35,779
The same reason your friends saved you.

1282
02:05:36,613 --> 02:05:40,117
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...

1283
02:05:40,283 --> 02:05:43,203
...I didn't want to cause you
any more pain.

1284
02:05:44,663 --> 02:05:46,790
I cared too much about you.

1285
02:06:11,648 --> 02:06:13,984
How come you're not at the feast?

1286
02:06:14,151 --> 02:06:18,697
Lost all my possessions. Apparently
people have been hiding them.

1287
02:06:18,864 --> 02:06:19,906
That's awful.

1288
02:06:20,073 --> 02:06:21,950
Oh, it's all good fun.

1289
02:06:22,117 --> 02:06:25,579
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.

1290
02:06:25,746 --> 02:06:28,123
Do you want any help finding them?

1291
02:06:31,001 --> 02:06:34,212
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

1292
02:06:41,261 --> 02:06:43,346
Are you sure you don't want
any help looking?

1293
02:06:43,513 --> 02:06:45,182
That's all right.

1294
02:06:45,348 --> 02:06:47,517
Anyway, my mum always said...

1295
02:06:47,684 --> 02:06:51,521
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.

1296
02:06:54,775 --> 02:06:58,028
If not always in the way we expect.

1297
02:06:59,529 --> 02:07:02,240
Think I'll just go have some pudding.

1298
02:07:37,901 --> 02:07:40,821
I've been thinking about something
Dumbledore said to me.

1299
02:07:40,987 --> 02:07:42,697
What's that?

1300
02:07:43,281 --> 02:07:46,076
That even though
we've got a fight ahead of us...

1301
02:07:46,243 --> 02:07:49,329
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

1302
02:07:49,496 --> 02:07:50,997
Yeah?

1303
02:07:52,916 --> 02:07:55,252
Something worth fighting for.
