1
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,679
<i>Been a while since I was up here
in front of you.</i>

2
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,849
<i>Maybe I'll do us all a favor
and just stick to the cards.</i>

3
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,605
<i>There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred</i>

4
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,106
<i>on the freeway and the rooftop...</i>

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,234
<i>Sorry, Mr. Stark, do you
honestly expect us to believe that</i>

6
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:28,905
<i>that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,</i>

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:31,699
<i>despite the fact
that you sorely despise bodyguards?</i>

8
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:32,909
<i>Yes.</i>

9
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:37,663
<i>And this mysterious bodyguard
was somehow equipped</i>

10
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:41,167
<i>with an undisclosed
Stark high-tech powered battle...</i>

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,211
<i>I know that it's confusing.</i>

12
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:46,839
<i>It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely</i>

13
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:50,134
<i>to make wild accusations,
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.</i>

14
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:56,432
<i>I mean, let's face it,
I'm not the heroic type.</i>

15
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,726
<i>A laundry list of character defects,</i>

16
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:01,646
<i>all the mistakes I've made,
largely public.</i>

17
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,356
<i>The truth is</i>

18
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,279
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

19
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,250
Ivan.

20
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:28,839
Vanya.

21
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:08,225
<i>270 at 30 knots.
Holding steady at 15,000 feet.</i>

22
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:11,645
<i>You are clear for exfiltration
over the drop zone.</i>

24
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:10,139
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!

25
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,558
It's good to be back.

26
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,228
- You missed me?
- Blow something up!

27
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:20,482
I missed you, too.
Blow something up? I already did that.

28
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,819
I'm not saying that the world is enjoying

29
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:28,073
its longest period of uninterrupted peace
in years because of me.

30
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:36,790
I'm not saying
that from the ashes of captivity,

31
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:41,920
never has a greater phoenix metaphor
been personified in human history.

32
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:50,929
I'm not saying that Uncle Sam
can kick back on a lawn chair,

33
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:52,639
sipping on an iced tea

34
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,768
because I haven't come across anyone
who's man enough

35
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,729
to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.

36
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,359
I love you, Tony!

37
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,570
Please, it's not about me.

38
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,740
It's not about you.

39
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:14,995
It's not even about us. It's about legacy.

40
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,832
It's about what we choose
to leave behind for future generations.

41
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:23,045
And that's why for the next year
and for the first time since 1974,

42
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,547
the best and brightest men and women

43
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,591
of nations and corporations
the world over

44
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:31,178
will pool their resources,
share their collective vision,

45
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,306
to leave behind a brighter future.

46
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,141
It's not about us.

47
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:40,187
Therefore, what I'm saying,
if I'm saying anything,

48
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,815
is welcome back to the Stark Expo.

49
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,238
And now,
making a special guest appearance

50
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,740
from the great beyond
to tell you what it's all about,

51
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:54,326
please welcome my father, Howard.

52
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:59,623
<i>Everything is achievable
through technology.</i>

53
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,000
<i>Better living, robust health,</i>

54
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:07,047
<i>and for the first time in human history,
the possibility of world peace.</i>

55
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:09,049
<i>So, from all of us here
at Stark Industries,</i>

56
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:13,929
<i>I would like to personally introduce you
to the City of the Future.</i>

57
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,766
<i>Technology holds infinite possibilities
for mankind,</i>

58
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,686
<i>and will one day rid society of all its ills.</i>

59
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,356
<i>Soon, technology will affect the way
you live your life every day.</i>

60
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,024
<i>No more tedious work,</i>

61
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:30,737
<i>leaving more time for leisure activities
and enjoying the sweet life.</i>

62
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:33,574
<i>The Stark Expo. Welcome.</i>

63
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,665
<i>We are coming to you live
from the kickoff of the Stark Expo,</i>

64
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,626
<i>where Tony Stark
has just walked offstage.</i>

65
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,295
<i>Don't worry
if you can't make it down here tonight</i>

66
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,797
<i>because this Expo goes on
all year long.</i>

67
00:09:48,881 --> 00:09:50,883
<i>And I'm gonna be here
checking out all the attractions</i>

68
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:54,511
<i>and the pavilions and the inventions
from all around the world.</i>

69
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:57,055
- <i>Make sure you join me...</i>
- All right, it's a zoo out there, watch out.

70
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:59,975
- Open up, let's go.
- Hey! Nice to see you.

71
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:02,603
- All right. Thank you. I remember you.
- Tony, Tony...

72
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,229
Hey, hey...

73
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,773
- Call me.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.

74
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:09,318
Hello. It would be a pleasure.

75
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,903
- Okay.
- See you, buddy.

76
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,070
This is Larry.

77
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:14,239
Hey, the oracle of Oracle.
What a pleasure.

78
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:15,824
- Nice to see you.
- Call me. Call me.

79
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,701
- Larry King.
- Larry!

80
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,537
Yes, my people, my people.

81
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,164
Come on, Tony. There we go.

82
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,124
- Very mellow.
- That wasn't so bad.

83
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,500
No, it was perfect.

84
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,085
Look what we got here, the new model.

85
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:28,879
- Hey, does she come with the car?
- I certainly hope so.

86
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,047
- Hi.
- Hi.

87
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,298
- And you are?
- Marshal.

88
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,300
- Irish. I like it.
- Pleased to meet you, Tony.

89
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,552
I'm on the wheel. Do you mind?
Where you from?

90
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:36,887
- Bedford.
- What are you doing here?

91
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,723
- Looking for you.
- Yeah? You found me.

92
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:44,269
- What are you up to later?
- Serving subpoenas.

93
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,898
He doesn't like to be handed things.

94
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,566
- Yeah, I have a peeve.
- I got it.

95
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,776
You are hereby ordered

96
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,111
to appear before
the Senate Armed Services Committee

97
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:54,863
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.

98
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,531
- Can I see a badge?
- You wanna see the badge?

99
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,909
He likes the badge.

100
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,078
- You still like it?
- Yep.

101
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,583
- How far are we from D.C.?
- D.C.? 250 miles.

102
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:15,217
<i>Mr. Stark, could we pick up now
where we left off? Mr. Stark. Please.</i>

103
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,885
<i>-Yes, dear?
- Can I have your attention?</i>

104
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,053
<i>Absolutely.</i>

105
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,098
<i>Do you or do you not possess
a specialized weapon?</i>

106
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,475
<i>-I do not. I do not.
- You do not?</i>

107
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,061
<i>Well, it depends
on how you define the word "weapon."</i>

108
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,814
<i>-The Iron Man weapon.
- My device does not fit that description.</i>

109
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,607
<i>Well... How would you describe it?</i>

110
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,735
<i>I would describe it by defining it
as what it is, Senator.</i>

111
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:37,614
<i>-As?
- It's a high-tech prosthesis.</i>

112
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:38,740
<i>That is... That is...</i>

113
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:41,118
<i>That's actually the most apt description
I can make of it.</i>

114
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,078
<i>It's a weapon. It's a weapon, Mr. Stark.</i>

115
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,248
<i>Please, if your priority was actually
the well-being of the American citizen...</i>

116
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,209
<i>My priority is to get the Iron Man
weapon turned over to the people</i>

117
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:52,671
<i>-of the United States of America.
- Well, you can forget it.</i>

118
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:57,009
<i>I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one.</i>

119
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,553
<i>To turn over the Iron Man suit
would be to turn over myself,</i>

120
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,639
<i>which is tantamount
to indentured servitude or prostitution,</i>

121
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,391
<i>depending on what state you're in.</i>

122
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,436
<i>-You can't have it.
- Look, I'm no expert...</i>

123
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,315
<i>In prostitution? Of course not.
You're a senator. Come on.</i>

124
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,735
<i>I'm no expert in weapons.</i>

125
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,653
<i>We have somebody here
who is an expert on weapons.</i>

126
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:21,491
<i>I'd now like to call Justin Hammer,
our current primary weapons contractor.</i>

127
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,996
<i>Let the record reflect that I observed
Mr. Hammer entering the chamber,</i>

128
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,414
<i>and I am wondering</i>

129
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:31,293
<i>if and when any actual expert
will also be in attendance.</i>

130
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:39,509
<i>Absolutely. I'm no expert.
I defer to you, Anthony.</i>

131
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,595
<i>You're the wonder boy.</i>

132
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,805
<i>Senator, if I may.</i>

133
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:48,352
<i>I may well not be an expert,
but you know who was the expert?</i>

134
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:51,063
<i>Your dad. Howard Stark.</i>

135
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:55,567
<i>Really a father to us all,
and to the military-industrial age.</i>

136
00:12:56,193 --> 00:13:00,697
<i>Let's just be clear.
He was no flower child. He was a lion.</i>

137
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,200
<i>We all know why we're here.
In the last six months,</i>

138
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:07,412
<i>Anthony Stark has created a sword
with untold possibilities.</i>

139
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,332
<i>And yet he insists it's a shield.</i>

140
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:15,045
<i>He asks us to trust him
as we cower behind it.</i>

141
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,382
<i>I wish I were comforted, Anthony,
I really do.</i>

142
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:21,593
<i>I'd love to leave my door unlocked
when I leave the house,</i>

143
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,136
<i>but this ain't Canada.</i>

144
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,888
<i>You know, we live in a world
of grave threats,</i>

145
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:28,725
<i>threats that Mr. Stark
will not always be able to foresee.</i>

146
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,228
<i>Thank you.</i>

147
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,064
<i>God bless Iron Man. God bless America.</i>

148
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,275
<i>That is well said, Mr. Hammer.</i>

149
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:39,319
<i>The committee would now like to invite</i>

150
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:42,531
<i>Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes
to the chamber.</i>

151
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,116
<i>Rhodey? What?</i>

152
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,708
Hey, buddy.
I didn't expect to see you here.

153
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,420
Look, it's me, I'm here.
Deal with it. Let's move on.

154
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:57,587
I just...

155
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,089
- Drop it.
- All right, I'll drop it.

156
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:02,676
<i>I have before me a complete report
on the Iron Man weapon,</i>

157
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,429
<i>compiled by Colonel Rhodes.
And, Colonel, for the record,</i>

158
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:08,640
<i>can you please read page 57,
paragraph four?</i>

159
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,017
<i>You're requesting
that I read specific selections</i>

160
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,394
<i>-from my report, Senator?
- Yes, sir.</i>

161
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,396
<i>It was my understanding
that I was going to be testifying</i>

162
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,648
<i>in a much more comprehensive
and detailed manner.</i>

163
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,358
<i>I understand.
A lot of things have changed today.</i>

164
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:19,734
<i>-So if you could just read...
- You do understand</i>

165
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,237
<i>that reading a single paragraph
out of context does not reflect</i>

166
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,615
<i>-the summary of my final...
- Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.</i>

167
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,076
<i>Very well.</i>

168
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:33,290
<i>"As he does not operate within
any definable branch of government,</i>

169
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:39,379
<i>"Iron Man presents a potential threat
to the security of both the nation</i>

170
00:14:39,463 --> 00:14:40,881
<i>"and to her interests."</i>

171
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,841
<i>I did, however, go on to summarize</i>

172
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,635
<i>that the benefits of iron Man
far out weigh the liabilities.</i>

173
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,888
<i>-And that it would be in our interest...
- That's enough, Colonel.</i>

174
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,139
<i>-...to fold Mr. Stark...
- That's enough.</i>

175
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,765
<i>...into the existing
chain of command, Senator.</i>

176
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:54,227
<i>I'm not a joiner, but I'll consider
Secretary of Defense, if you ask nice.</i>

177
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,980
<i>We can amend the hours a little bit.</i>

178
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,399
<i>I'd like to go on and show, if I may,</i>

179
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,651
<i>the imagery
that's connected to your report.</i>

180
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,613
<i>I believe it is somewhat premature
to reveal these images</i>

181
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,490
<i>-to the general public at this time.
- With all due respect,</i>

182
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:07,782
<i>Colonel, I understand.</i>

183
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:11,953
<i>And if you could just narrate those
for us, we'd be very grateful.</i>

184
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,997
Let's have the images.

185
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:18,668
<i>Intelligence suggests
that the devices seen in these photos</i>

186
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,630
<i>are, in fact, attempts
at making manned copies</i>

187
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:23,173
<i>of Mr. Stark's suit.</i>

188
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:28,303
<i>This has been corroborated by our allies
and local intelligence on the ground,</i>

189
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:33,517
<i>indicating that these suits are quite
possibly, at this moment, operational.</i>

190
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:37,604
Hold on one second, buddy.
Let me see something here.

191
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:41,191
Boy, I'm good.
I commandeered your screens.

192
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,694
I need them.
Time for a little transparency.

193
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,696
<i>-Now, let's see what's really going on.
- What is he doing?</i>

194
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,033
<i>If you will direct your attention
to said screens...</i>

195
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,701
<i>I believe that's North Korea.</i>

196
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,796
Can you turn that off? Take it off.

197
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,047
Iran.

198
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:11,555
No grave immediate threat here.
Is that Justin Hammer?

199
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,099
How did Hammer get in the game?

200
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,810
Justin, you're on TV. Focus up.

201
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,398
<i>Okay, give me a left twist.
Left's good. Turn to the right.</i>

202
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,528
<i>Oh, shit. Oh, shit!</i>

203
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,779
Wow.

204
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:32,534
Yeah, I'd say most countries,
five, 10 years away.

205
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:33,910
Hammer Industries, 20.

206
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,621
<i>I'd like to point out
that that test pilot survived.</i>

207
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,248
<i>I think we're done,
is the point that he's making.</i>

208
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:41,543
<i>-I don't think there's any reason...
- The point is, you're welcome, I guess.</i>

209
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,462
<i>-For what?
- Because I'm your nuclear deter rent.</i>

210
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:47,090
<i>It's working.
We're safe. America is secure.</i>

211
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,092
<i>You want my property?
You can't have it.</i>

212
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,593
<i>But I did you a big favor.</i>

213
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,264
I've successfully privatized world peace.

214
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,644
What more do you want? For now!

215
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,315
I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.

216
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,776
<i>...you, Mr. Stark... you, buddy.</i>

217
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,987
We're adjourned.
We're adjourned for today.

218
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,364
- Okay.
- You've been a delight.

219
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,456
<i>My bond is with the people.</i>

220
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:24,794
<i>And I will serve this great nation
at the pleasure of myself</i>

221
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:26,463
<i>If there's one thing I've proven</i>

222
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,883
<i>it's that you can count on me
to pleasure myself</i>

223
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,087
Wake up. Daddy's home.

224
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,755
<i>Welcome home, sir.</i>

225
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,715
<i>Congratulations on
the opening ceremonies.</i>

226
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,843
<i>They were such a success,
as was your Senate hearing.</i>

227
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,678
<i>And may I say how refreshing it is</i>

228
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:19,516
<i>to finally see you in a video
with your clothing on, sir.</i>

229
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,560
You!

230
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,355
I swear to God I'll dismantle you.
I'll soak your motherboard.

231
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,024
I'll turn you into a wine rack.

232
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,777
How many ounces a day
of this gobbledegook

233
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,945
am I supposed to drink?

234
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:36,032
<i>We are up to 80 ounces a day
to counteract the symptoms, sir.</i>

235
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,952
Check palladium levels.

236
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,206
<i>Blood toxicity, 24%.</i>

237
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,043
<i>It appears that the continued use
of the Iron Man suit</i>

238
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,546
<i>is accelerating your condition.</i>

239
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,425
<i>Another core has been depleted.</i>

240
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,471
God, they're running out quick.

241
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,224
<i>I have run simulations
on every known element,</i>

242
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,351
<i>and none can serve
as a viable replacement</i>

243
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,437
<i>for the palladium core.</i>

244
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,733
<i>You are running out of both time
and options.</i>

245
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:17,157
<i>Unfortunately, the device
that's keeping you alive</i>

246
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,075
<i>is also killing you.</i>

247
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:21,995
<i>Miss Potts is approaching.</i>

248
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,998
- <i>I recommend that you inform her...</i>
- Mute.

249
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,669
Is this a joke?

250
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,755
- What are you thinking?
- What?

251
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,133
- What are you thinking?
- Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy.

252
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,552
And you're angry about something.

253
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,012
Do you have the sniffles?
I don't wanna get sick.

254
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,513
- Did you just donate...
- Keep your business.

255
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:44,142
...our entire modern art collection
to the...

256
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:45,852
- Boy Scouts of America.
- ...Boy Scouts of America?

257
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,729
Yes. It is a worthwhile organization.

258
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:51,191
I didn't physically check the crates
but, basically, yes.

259
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,443
And it's not "our" collection,
it's my collection. No offense.

260
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,570
No, you know what?
I think I'm actually entitled

261
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,238
to say "our" collection

262
00:19:57,322 --> 00:20:00,533
considering the time that I put in,
over 10 years,

263
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,452
- curating that.
- It was a tax write-off. I needed that.

264
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,622
You know,
there's only about 8,011 things

265
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,665
that I really need to talk to you about.

266
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,209
Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out.

267
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:10,752
The Bridgeport's
already machining that part.

268
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,213
The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.

269
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,548
I need you to wear a surgical mask
until you're feeling better.

270
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:16,674
- Is that okay?
- That's rude.

271
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,259
There's nothing more important to me
than the Expo.

272
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,677
It's my primary point of concern.

273
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,931
- I don't know why you're...
- The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

274
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,807
Wow. Look at that.

275
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,394
That's modern art. That's going up.

276
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:31,231
- You've got to be kidding.
- I'm gonna put this up right now.

277
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:33,525
- This is vital.
- Stark is in complete disarray.

278
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,944
- You understand that?
- No. Our stocks have never been higher.

279
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:38,363
- Yes, from a managerial standpoint.
- You are... Well, if it's messy,

280
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,948
- then let's double back.
- Let me give you an example.

281
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,616
- Let's move on to another subject.
- No, no, no, no.

282
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,409
You are not taking down
the Barnett Newman

283
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:44,994
- and hanging that up!
- I'm not taking it down.

284
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,329
I'm just replacing it with this.

285
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,789
- Let's see what I can get going here.
- Okay, fine.

286
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:51,000
My point is,
we have already awarded contracts

287
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,752
- to the wind farm people.
- Yeah. Don't say "wind farm."

288
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,921
- I'm already feeling gassy.
- And to the plastic plantation tree,

289
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,131
which was your idea, by the way.
Those people are on payroll...

290
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,008
- Everything was my idea.
- ...and you won't make a decision.

291
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,802
I don't care
about the liberal agenda anymore.

292
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,263
It's boring. Boring.
I'm giving you a boring alert.

293
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,640
- You do it.
- I do what?

294
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,684
Excellent idea. I just figured this out.
You run the company.

295
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,562
- Yeah, I'm trying to run the company.
- Pepper, I need you to run the company.

296
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,063
- Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
- You will not

297
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,815
- give me the information...
- I'm not asking you to try...

298
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,024
- ...in order to...
- I'm asking you

299
00:21:15,108 --> 00:21:16,317
to physically do it. I need you to do it.

300
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,152
- I am trying to do it.
- Pepper, you're not listening to me!

301
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:20,154
- No, you are not listening to me.
- I'm trying to make you CEO.

302
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:22,115
Why won't you let me?

303
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,660
- Have you been drinking?
- Chlorophyll.

304
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:31,833
I hereby irrevocably appoint you
chairman and CEO of Stark Industries,

305
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,835
effective immediately.

306
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,922
Yeah, done deal. Okay?

307
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:41,968
I've actually given this
a fair amount of thought,

308
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:45,972
believe it or not.
Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak,

309
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:49,934
trying to figure out
who a worthy successor would be.

310
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,811
And then I realized

311
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,899
it's you. It's always been you.

312
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,028
I thought there'd be a legal issue,

313
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,573
but actually I'm capable
of appointing my successor.

314
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,284
My successor being you.

315
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,121
Congratulations?

316
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:13,458
- Take it, just take it.
- I don't know what to think.

317
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,335
Don't think. Drink.

318
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:21,174
There you go.

319
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:05,802
The notary's here! Can you please
come sign the transfer paperwork?

320
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,804
I'm on happy time.

321
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,269
- Sorry.
- What the hell was that?

322
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:17,772
It's called mixed martial arts.
It's been around for three weeks.

323
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:19,941
It's called dirty boxing.
There's nothing new about it.

324
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,485
All right, put them up. Come on.

325
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:30,034
I promise you this is the only time
I will ask you to sign over your company.

326
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:33,621
I need you to initial each box.

327
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:36,958
Lesson one. Never take your eye off...

328
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:40,461
That's it. I'm done.

329
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:42,964
- What's your name, lady?
- Rushman. Natalie Rushman.

330
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,632
Front and center. Come into the church.

331
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:48,511
- No. You're seriously not gonna ask...
- If it pleases the court, which it does.

332
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,931
- It's no problem.
- I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.

333
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,654
What?

334
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,202
- Can you give her a lesson?
- No problem.

335
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,288
- Pepper.
- What?

336
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,791
- Who is she?
- She is from legal.

337
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:22,962
And she is potentially a very expensive
sexual harassment lawsuit

338
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,214
- if you keep ogling her like that.
- I need a new assistant, boss.

339
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:28,092
Yes, and I've got
three excellent potential candidates.

340
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,719
They're lined up and ready to meet you.

341
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,680
I don't have time to meet.
I need someone now. I feel like it's her.

342
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:33,848
No, it's not.

343
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,725
- You ever boxed before?
- I have, yes.

344
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:39,771
What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot
Camp? Crunch? Something like that?

345
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:43,608
- How do I spell your name, Natalie?
- R-U-S-H-M-A-N.

346
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:48,112
- What, are you gonna Google her now?
- I thought I was ogling her.

347
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:51,866
- Wow. Very, very impressive individual.
- You're so predictable, you know that?

348
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:54,118
She's fluent in French, Italian,
Russian, Latin.

349
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:56,078
- Who speaks Latin?
- No one speaks Latin.

350
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,456
- No one speaks Latin?
- It's a dead language.

351
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,333
You can read Latin
or you can write Latin,

352
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,001
- but you can't speak Latin...
- Did you model in Tokyo?

353
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,836
- 'Cause she modeled in Tokyo.
- Well...

354
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,296
I need her.
She's got everything that I need.

355
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:09,008
Rule number one,
never take your eye off your opponent.

356
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:11,636
Oh, my God!

357
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:16,641
- Happy!
- That's what I'm talking about.

358
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,059
- I just slipped.
- You did?

359
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,478
- Yeah.
- Looks like a TKO to me.

360
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:25,024
Just... I need your impression.

361
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,819
You have a quiet reserve.
I don't know, you have an old soul.

362
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:30,404
- I meant your fingerprint.
- Right.

363
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:36,786
- So, how are we doing?
- Great. Just wrapping up. Hey.

364
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,249
- You're the boss.
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?

365
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,292
- No.
- Yes, that will be all, Ms. Rushman.

366
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,211
Thank you very much.

367
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,882
- I want one.
- No.

368
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:26,168
You know, it's Europe.
Whatever happens the next 20 minutes,

369
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,503
- just go with it.
- Go with it? Go with what?

370
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:29,130
- Mr. Stark?
- Hey.

371
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:30,423
Hello. How was your flight?

372
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,008
It was excellent.
Boy, it's nice to see you.

373
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:36,262
We have one photographer
from the ACM, if you don't mind. Okay?

374
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:38,431
- When did this happen?
- What? You made me do it.

375
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:41,058
- I made you do what?
- You quit. Smile. Look right there.

376
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,268
Stop acting constipated.

377
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,811
- Don't flare your nostrils.
- You are so predictable.

378
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:44,937
- That's the amazing thing.
- Right this way.

379
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:46,731
- You look fantastic.
- Why, thank you very much.

380
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,649
But that's unprofessional.
What's on the docket?

381
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,651
You have a 9:30 dinner.

382
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,486
- Perfect. I'll be there at 11 :00.
- Absolutely.

383
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,405
- Is this us?
- It can be.

384
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,157
- Great. Make it us.
- Okay.

385
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,701
- Mr. Musk. How are you?
- Hi, Pepper.

386
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:00,661
- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Thank you very much.

387
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:02,997
Elon, how's it going?
Those Merlin engines are fantastic.

388
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,082
Thank you. Yeah, I've got an idea
for an electric jet.

389
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,250
- You do?
- Yeah.

390
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:08,377
Then we'll make it work.

391
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:10,212
- You want a massage?
- Oh, God. No,

392
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:11,756
- I don't want a massage.
- I'll have Natalie make an...

393
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,257
- I don't want Natalie to do...
- Don't want you tense.

394
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:14,508
By the way, I didn't mean
to spring this on you.

395
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:15,718
Thank you very much.

396
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,762
- Green is not your best color.
- Oh, please.

397
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,388
Anthony! Is that you?

398
00:27:19,472 --> 00:27:20,765
- My least favorite person on Earth.
- Hey, pal.

399
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,141
- Justin Hammer.
- How you doing?

400
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,019
You're not the only rich guy here
with a fancy car.

401
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,521
You know Christine Everhart
from <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

402
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:28,731
- You guys know each other?
- Hi.

403
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,066
- Yes.
- Yes.

404
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,317
- Yes, roughly.
- We do.

405
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,446
BTW, big story.
The new CEO of Stark Industries.

406
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:36,822
- I know. I know.
- Congratulations.

407
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:40,368
My editor will kill me if I don't grab
a quote for our Powerful Women issue.

408
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:41,619
- Can I?
- Sure.

409
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:44,205
She's actually doing a big spread on me
for <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

410
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,207
I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know.

411
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,375
- Right.
- Right?

412
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:50,836
Well, she did quite a spread
on Tony last year.

413
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,254
And she wrote a story as well.

414
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,382
- It was very impressive.
- That was good.

415
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,509
- Very well done.
- Thank you.

416
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,052
- I'm gonna go wash.
- Don't leave me.

417
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,595
- Hey, buddy. How you doing?
- I'm all right.

418
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:00,972
- Looking gorgeous.
- Please, this is tough.

419
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:03,683
- Can I ask you... Is this the first time...
- <i>Fromage.</i>

420
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,267
- Say, "Brie."
- ...that you guys have seen each other?

421
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,603
God, that's so awful.

422
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:10,064
Listen, is it the first time you've seen
each other since the Senate?

423
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,816
Since he got his contract revoked...

424
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,110
- Actually, it's on hold.
- ...when you were attempting to...

425
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,195
That's not what I heard.
What's the difference between "hold"

426
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,114
- and "canceled"? The truth?
- Yes, what is?

427
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,574
No. The truth is...
Why don't we put that away?

428
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:24,662
The truth is, I'm actually hoping
to present something at your Expo.

429
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:27,123
Well, if you invent something
that works,

430
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,624
I'll make sure I get you a slot.

431
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,918
- Mr. Stark, your corner table is ready.
- Yes?

432
00:28:31,002 --> 00:28:33,212
I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.

433
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:36,465
- Hammer needs a slot, Christine.
- We kid, yeah.

434
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,509
We kid. We're kidders.

435
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:02,908
Got any other bad ideas?

436
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:08,289
Tony!

437
00:29:12,126 --> 00:29:16,422
Tony and I... Tony... I love Tony Stark.
Tony loves me. We're not competitors.

438
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,966
Him being out of the picture
created tremendous opportunities

439
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,552
for Hammer Industries, you know?

440
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:24,972
- Everything that Tony and I do...
- <i>Well, what's the use of having...</i>

441
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:27,933
- ...is a healthy...
- <i>...and owning a race car...</i>

442
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:30,978
- ...competition.
- <i>...if you don't drive it?</i>

443
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:33,564
Is he driving?

444
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,531
Natalie. Natalie!

445
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:44,658
- Yes, Miss Potts?
- Did you know about this?

446
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:46,952
This is the first that I have known of it.

447
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,788
This... This cannot happen.

448
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:50,539
Absolutely. I understand.
How can I help you?

449
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:51,874
- Where's Happy?
- He's waiting outside.

450
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,834
- Okay, get him. I need Happy.
- Right away.

451
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,712
Tony's... You know, he...

452
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,672
We're not competitive.
You know what I mean?

453
00:29:58,756 --> 00:29:59,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,

454
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:02,885
- can you excuse me just one second?
- Just read me what you wrote.

455
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,178
- I will. I will, after.
- Just read it back to me.

456
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,513
But I have to make one quick phone call.

457
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:06,680
- Where are you going?
- This is great.

458
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:08,140
- I've got some caviar coming.
- This is great stuff.

459
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,725
- I'll be right back.
- Look!

460
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,310
That's Stark.

461
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,554
Go, go!

462
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,434
Hang on.

463
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:26,213
- Give me the case.
- Here. Take it.

464
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:27,881
- Where's the key?
- It's in my pocket.

465
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:29,133
Car!

466
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,198
Oh, my God!

467
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:43,332
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

468
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:46,335
- Were you heading for me or him?
- I was trying to scare him.

469
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,420
- 'Cause I can't tell!
- Are you out of your mind?

470
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:50,464
- Better security.
- Get in the car right now!

471
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,299
I was attacked! We need better security.

472
00:34:52,383 --> 00:34:54,635
- Get in the car!
- You're CEO. Better security measures.

473
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,470
God, it's embarrassing.

474
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,556
First vacation in two years.

475
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:05,646
Oh, my God!

476
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,982
- I got him!
- Hit him again. Hit him again.

477
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,943
Football.

478
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:15,447
- I got him!
- Take the case! Take it!

479
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:17,199
- Take the case!
- Give him the case!

480
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,118
Stop banging the car!

481
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:23,622
Calm down.

482
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,542
God! God!

483
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:31,880
Give me the case! Please! Come on!

484
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,933
You... You lose.

485
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,900
You lose. You lose, Stark.

486
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:12,124
Pretty decent tech.
Cycles per second were a little low.

487
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,799
You could have doubled up
your rotations.

488
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,263
You focused the repulsor energy
through ionized plasma channels.

489
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:29,266
It's effective. Not very efficient.

490
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:32,644
But it's a passable knock-off.

491
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:34,855
I don't get it. A little fine tuning,

492
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:36,732
you could have made a solid paycheck.

493
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:40,986
You could have sold it
to North Korea, China, Iran,

494
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,697
or gone right to the black market.

495
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,742
You look like you got friends
in low places.

496
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:52,372
You come from a family
of thieves and butchers.

497
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:56,043
And now, like all guilty men,

498
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,588
you try to rewrite your own history.

499
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:05,260
And you forget all the lives
the Stark family has destroyed.

500
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:09,681
Speaking of thieves,
where did you get this design?

501
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:12,684
My father. Anton Vanko.

502
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:16,063
Well, I never heard of him.

503
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:19,858
My father is the reason you're alive.

504
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,110
The reason I'm alive
is 'cause you had a shot, you took it,

505
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:23,737
you missed.

506
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,030
Did I?

507
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:30,035
If you can make God bleed,

508
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:33,914
the people will cease to believe in him.

509
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:39,586
And there will be blood in the water.
And the sharks will come.

510
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:46,009
The truth,
all I have to do is sit here and watch

511
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:48,595
as the world will consume you.

512
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,764
Where will you be watching
the world consume me from?

513
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:54,768
That's right. A prison cell.
I'll send you a bar of soap.

514
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,145
Hey, Tony. Before you go,

515
00:39:57,229 --> 00:40:00,607
palladium in the chest,
painful way to die.

516
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:21,503
<i>It's just unbelievable. It proves
that the genie is out of the bottle</i>

517
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,047
<i>and this man has no idea
what he's doing.</i>

518
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:27,884
<i>He thinks of the Iron Man weapon
as a toy.</i>

519
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:32,806
<i>I was at a hearing
where Mr. Stark, in fact, was adamant</i>

520
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:36,518
<i>that these suits
can't exist anywhere else,</i>

521
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,146
<i>don't exist anywhere else,
never will exist anywhere else,</i>

522
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:40,564
<i>at least for five to 10 years,</i>

523
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:45,277
<i>and here we are in Monaco realizing,
"These suits exist now."</i>

524
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,528
Mute.

525
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:52,117
He should be giving me a medal.
That's the truth.

526
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:59,458
- What is that?
- This is your in-flight meal.

527
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:04,629
Did you just make that?

528
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:08,133
Yeah. Where do you think I've been
for three hours?

529
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,302
Tony,

530
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:14,723
what are you not telling me?

531
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:21,646
I don't want to go home. At all.

532
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:26,610
Let's cancel my birthday party and...

533
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:29,279
We're in Europe.
Let's go to Venice, Cipriani.

534
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:30,572
- Remember?
- Oh, yes.

535
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,532
It's a great place to

536
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:38,163
- be healthy.
- I don't think this is the right time.

537
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,499
We're in kind of a mess.

538
00:41:40,582 --> 00:41:42,209
Yeah, but maybe that's why
it's the best time.

539
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:44,336
- 'Cause then we...
- Well, I think as the CEO,

540
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:45,545
I need to show up.

541
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:49,925
As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.

542
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,343
- A leave?
- A company retreat.

543
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,970
- A retreat? During a time like this?
- Just a ride.

544
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:57,641
Well, I'm just saying, to recharge
our batteries and figure it all out.

545
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:00,477
Not everybody runs on batteries, Tony.

546
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:14,569
Hey, there he is.

547
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:16,738
There he is.

548
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:21,826
What an absolute pleasure. Welcome.

549
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,953
Oh, goodness gracious.

550
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,582
Can we get the handcuffs
off my friend here?

551
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:31,169
Forgive me, I'm sorry.
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

552
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:35,048
I didn't want to make
a first impression like this.

553
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,425
He's not an animal. Come on.

554
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:40,970
He's a human being. Thank you.

555
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,435
We're fine.

556
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:50,772
My name is Justin Hammer.

557
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:54,192
I'd like to do some business with you.
Please sit.

558
00:44:57,946 --> 00:45:00,407
Dig in. What do we have today, Jack?

559
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:03,827
- We have some salmon carpaccio.
- Salmon carpaccio.

560
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:07,122
Anything you want here, we got it.

561
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:11,292
I like my dessert first.
I had this flown in from San Francisco.

562
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:13,253
It's Italian, though.

563
00:45:13,336 --> 00:45:15,130
Organic ice cream.

564
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:19,134
I got a sweet tooth.
Apparently you do, too, for Tony Stark.

565
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,847
What I saw you do to Tony Stark
on that track,

566
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:27,600
how you stepped up to him
in front of God and everybody,

567
00:45:27,684 --> 00:45:29,811
that was... Wow!

568
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,438
You spoke to me with what you did.

569
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:34,149
And I know that you knew
that I'd be listening.

570
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:35,775
This is why I couldn't bear
to have you shipped off

571
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:38,653
to God knows where. It would have been
such a waste of talent.

572
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:40,071
But if I might make a suggestion,

573
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:42,866
you know,
you don't just go and try and kill the guy.

574
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:47,203
I think, if I may, you go after his legacy.

575
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,372
That's what you kill.

576
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:52,459
You and me,
we are a lot alike in a lot of ways.

577
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:57,172
The only difference between you and I
is that I have resources.

578
00:45:58,006 --> 00:46:00,425
I think, if I may,

579
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,844
you need my resources.

580
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,513
Someone behind you, a benefactor.

581
00:46:05,597 --> 00:46:07,682
I'd like to be that guy.

582
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:23,865
Okay. Do you speak English?
Because I can get a translator.

583
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,785
I don't know. Have you been
understanding everything I'm saying?

584
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:28,286
Very good, man.

585
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:31,539
- Very good, man.
- Very good, man.

586
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:32,749
Hey!

587
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,461
- Hey.
- Yes?

588
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,129
I want my bird.

589
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:43,802
- A bird? You want a bird?
- I want my bird.

590
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:45,553
I can get you a bird.
I can get you 10 birds.

591
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:47,180
I want my bird.

592
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,808
Well, okay.
Nothing's impossible. I could...

593
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:53,561
Are we talking about...
Is this a bird back in Russia?

594
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:56,689
Yes, but the fundamentals
of the company are still very, very strong

595
00:46:56,773 --> 00:46:58,691
- despite the events in Monaco.
- Yes, of course.

596
00:46:58,775 --> 00:47:02,237
- The AP wants a quote.
- Don't tell him. Fax them...

597
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,822
Where is he?

598
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:05,698
- He doesn't want to be disturbed.
- He's downstairs.

599
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:07,242
- <i>...what happened in Monaco?</i>
- Yes, but...

600
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,828
<i>But his continuing erratic behavior</i>

601
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:12,038
<i>may lead many people
to ask themselves,</i>

602
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,957
<i>"Can this man still protect us?"</i>

603
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:17,335
Iron Man never stopped protecting us.
The events in Monaco proved that.

604
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:23,007
<i>Query complete, sir.
Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist</i>

605
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:26,094
<i>who defected to the United States
in 1963.</i>

606
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:30,348
<i>However, he was accused of espionage
and was deported in 1967.</i>

607
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,809
<i>His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist,</i>

608
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:37,647
<i>was convicted of selling Soviet-era
weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan,</i>

609
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:40,233
<i>and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison.</i>

610
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:42,443
<i>No further records exist.</i>

611
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:48,616
Tony, you gotta get upstairs

612
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,952
and get on top
of this situation right now.

613
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:54,038
Listen. I've been on the phone
with the National Guard all day,

614
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:58,209
trying to talk them out
of rolling tanks up the PCH,

615
00:47:58,293 --> 00:48:01,170
knocking down your front door
and taking these.

616
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:03,298
They're gonna take your suits,
Tony, okay?

617
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,300
They're sick of the games.

618
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:08,595
You said nobody else would possess
this technology for 20 years.

619
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:11,890
Well, guess what?
Somebody else had it yesterday.

620
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:14,309
It's not theoretical anymore.

621
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:17,562
Are you listening to me?

622
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:21,316
- Are you okay?
- Let's go.

623
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:28,239
Hey, man. Hey, hey!

624
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:33,953
- You all right?
- Yeah, I should get to my desk.

625
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:36,164
- See that cigar box?
- Yeah.

626
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:38,166
It's palladium.

627
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:46,633
Is that supposed to be smoking?

628
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:51,012
If you must know, it's neutron damage.
It's from the reactor wall.

629
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:56,851
You had this in your body?

630
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:05,526
And how about the high-tech
crossword puzzle on your neck?

631
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,028
Road rash.

632
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:11,783
Thank you.

633
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:26,714
- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking at you.

634
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:29,842
You wanna do
this whole lone gunslinger act

635
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:31,969
and it's unnecessary.
You don't have to do this alone.

636
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:34,263
You know, I wish I could believe that.
I really do.

637
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:36,599
But you've gotta trust me.

638
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:40,478
Contrary to popular belief,
I know exactly what I'm doing.

639
00:49:49,237 --> 00:49:51,531
This is where we do it.
This is my humble abode.

640
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:55,076
You can work in absolute peace.
Must be fun to be dead, right?

641
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,577
No pressure.

642
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:59,664
Here they are. I'm very excited.
They're combat-ready.

643
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:01,207
I may have done a few miscalculations

644
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,292
and rushed the prototype
into production.

645
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:05,253
Sue me, I'm enthusiastic.

646
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,630
Go ahead, take a look around.

647
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:14,345
You don't wanna do that.

648
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:16,055
You'll be able to access that

649
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:18,057
as soon as we generate
some encrypted pass codes.

650
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:20,226
Can we generate
some encrypted pass codes?

651
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:23,438
Get some of those
encrypted pass codes, Jack.

652
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:26,274
Never mind, I...

653
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:30,820
Wow. Okay. Good stuff.

654
00:50:33,281 --> 00:50:35,616
- Sorry?
- Software shit.

655
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:39,120
Well...

656
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,039
You're good.

657
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:45,460
You really blasted in
past the firewall there.

658
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:49,589
Let me show you where
you're gonna be working primarily.

659
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,632
Go ahead, take a look.

660
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:55,136
Get a good look at that.
That's something, isn't it?

661
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:57,221
You know,
those are really just for show and tell.

662
00:50:57,305 --> 00:51:02,310
They're $125.7 million a pop, so...
Wait! Oh, gosh.

663
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:07,315
Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here.

664
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:10,735
That's where the pilot goes.

665
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:14,864
I'm having a tough time
finding volunteers.

666
00:51:14,989 --> 00:51:18,117
I'll take care of that, just leave it.

667
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:19,702
What you want them do?

668
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:24,999
Well, long term, I want them to put me
in the Pentagon for the next 25 years.

669
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:27,126
I want to make Iron Man
look like an antique.

670
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:28,336
I wanna go to that Stark Expo,

671
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:30,338
I wanna take a dump
in Tony's front yard.

672
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,839
You know what I'm talking about?

673
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:34,091
- I can do that. No problem.
- Yeah?

674
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:36,344
Hey, fabulous! I love it.

675
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:39,138
Hey, this is our guy. Didn't I tell you?
I had a feeling.

676
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:51,192
Do you know which watch
you'd like to wear tonight, Mr. Stark?

677
00:51:51,526 --> 00:51:53,528
I'll give them a look.

678
00:51:56,405 --> 00:51:57,865
I should cancel the party.

679
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:00,201
- Probably.
- Yeah.

680
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,912
- 'Cause it's...
- III-timed.

681
00:52:03,037 --> 00:52:04,497
Right, sends the wrong message.

682
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,082
Inappropriate.

683
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:14,215
Is that dirty enough for you?

684
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:18,970
Gold face, brown band.
The Jaeger. I'll give that a look.

685
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:20,930
Bring them over here.

686
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:26,394
I'll take that. Why don't you...

687
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:40,783
I gotta say it.
It's hard to get a read on you.

688
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:43,244
- Where are you from?
- Legal.

689
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:48,082
Can I ask you a question,
hypothetically?

690
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,458
Bit odd.

691
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:53,129
If this was your last birthday party
you were ever gonna have,

692
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:54,797
how would you celebrate it?

693
00:52:57,466 --> 00:53:01,637
I'd do whatever I wanted to do
with whoever I wanted to do it with.

694
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:34,462
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

695
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:37,340
Yes, sir, I understand.

696
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:41,677
No. No, sir, that will not be necessary.
I'll handle it.

697
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:44,096
Sir, I personally guarantee
that within 24 hours,

698
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,015
Iron Man will be back on watch.

699
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:54,815
Hey, Pepper.

700
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:57,234
I'm going to go get some air.

701
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:58,694
What's wrong?

702
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:01,822
- I don't know what to do.
- You gotta be kidding me.

703
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:10,623
- That's it. I'm making... Pepper.
- No, no, no. Don't call anyone.

704
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:12,625
This is ridiculous.
I just stuck my neck out for this guy.

705
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:13,960
I know. I know. I get it.

706
00:54:14,043 --> 00:54:15,294
I'm gonna handle it, okay?
Just let me handle it.

707
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:18,339
Handle it. Or I'm gonna have to.

708
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:21,175
<i>You know, the question
I get asked most often is,</i>

709
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,761
<i>"Tony, how do you go to the bathroom
in the suit?"</i>

710
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:28,599
<i>Just like that.</i>

711
00:54:32,228 --> 00:54:35,189
<i>Does this guy know
how to throw a party or what?</i>

712
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:39,902
<i>I love you.</i>

713
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:42,655
<i>Unbelievable! Thank you so much.</i>

714
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:46,701
<i>Tony, we all thank you so much
for such a wonderful night.</i>

715
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:50,788
<i>And we're gonna say good night now,
and thank you all for coming.</i>

716
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:52,081
<i>No, no, no, we can't... Wait, wait, wait.</i>

717
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:53,958
We didn't have the cake.
We didn't blow out the candles.

718
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,836
You're out of control, okay?
Trust me on this one, okay?

719
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:59,255
- You're out of control, gorgeous.
- It's time to go to bed. It's time.

720
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,464
- Give me another smooch.
- You're not going to be

721
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:01,757
- happy about this.
- Come on, you know you want to.

722
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,217
You just peed the suit.

723
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,760
- I know. It has a filtration system.
- It's not sexy.

724
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:06,262
You could drink that water.

725
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:09,932
Just send everybody home, okay?
It's time to...

726
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:11,767
- If you say so.
- Okay.

727
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:14,061
I'll take this, you take that.

728
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:17,064
<i>Pepper Potts.</i>

729
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:19,900
<i>She's right. The party's over.</i>

730
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:22,945
<i>Then again, the party was over for me,
like, an hour and a half ago.</i>

731
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:26,574
<i>The after-party starts in 15 minutes.</i>

732
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:34,290
And if anybody, Pepper,
doesn't like it, there's the door.

733
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:42,131
Yeah!

734
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,762
Hit!

735
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:56,145
Pull!

736
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:06,614
Pull!

737
00:56:15,623 --> 00:56:17,792
I think she wants the Gallagher!

738
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:29,053
I'm only gonna say this once.

739
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:33,891
Get out.

740
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,484
You don't deserve to wear one of these.
Shut it down!

741
00:56:45,111 --> 00:56:46,278
<i>Goldstein.</i>

742
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:48,739
Yes, Mr. Stark?

743
00:56:48,823 --> 00:56:52,076
Give me a phat beat
to beat my buddy's ass to.

744
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:57,873
I told you to shut it down.

745
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:11,971
Now, put that thing back where
you found it before someone gets hurt.

746
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:19,937
Really?

747
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:31,323
Sorry, pal,
but Iron Man doesn't have a sidekick.

748
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:34,160
Sidekick this!

749
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:44,170
Had enough?

750
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:46,547
- Natalie!
- Miss Potts.

751
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,757
Don't you "Miss Potts" me! I'm on to you.

752
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:50,885
You know what?
Ever since you came here...

753
00:57:54,597 --> 00:57:55,639
Pepper!

754
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:58,517
Get out of here. Get out of here.

755
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:07,526
You want it? Take it!

756
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:49,985
Put your hand down.

757
00:58:50,069 --> 00:58:52,279
You think you got what it takes
to wear that suit?

758
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:53,656
We don't have to do this, Tony.

759
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:55,616
You wanna be the War Machine,
take your shot.

760
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,534
- Put it down!
- You gonna take a shot?

761
00:58:57,618 --> 00:58:58,869
- Put it down!
- No!

762
00:58:58,953 --> 00:59:00,412
- Drop it, Tony!
- Take it.

763
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:13,861
<i>Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant
Colonel James Rhodes,</i>

764
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:17,156
<i>inbound from three miles east
at 5,000 feet...</i>

765
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:02,910
Colonel.

766
01:01:03,869 --> 01:01:05,120
Major.

767
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:06,997
Wow.

768
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:09,500
Yeah.

769
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:13,253
Let's take it inside.

770
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:14,838
Clear the area.

771
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:38,821
Sir!

772
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:41,365
I'm gonna have to ask you
to exit the donut.

773
01:01:45,411 --> 01:01:47,579
I told you I don't wanna join
your super-secret boy band.

774
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:52,126
No, no, no. See, I remember,
you do everything yourself.

775
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:55,421
- How's that working out for you?
- It's... It's... It's...

776
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:58,257
I'm sorry.
I don't wanna get off on the wrong foot.

777
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,134
Do I look at the patch or the eye?

778
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,344
Honestly, I'm a bit hung over.

779
01:02:02,428 --> 01:02:04,763
I'm not sure if you're real
or if I'm having...

780
01:02:04,847 --> 01:02:06,932
I am very real.

781
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:09,017
I'm the realest person
you're ever gonna meet.

782
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:12,771
- Just my luck. Where's the staff here?
- That's not looking so good.

783
01:02:13,522 --> 01:02:15,524
I've been worse.

784
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:18,235
We've secured the perimeter,

785
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:21,196
but I don't think we should
hold it for too much longer.

786
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:27,619
- You're fired.
- That's not up to you.

787
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:31,540
Tony, I want you to meet
Agent Romanoff.

788
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:32,749
- Hi.
- I'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. shadow.

789
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:35,461
Once we knew you were ill,
I was tasked to you by Director Fury.

790
01:02:35,544 --> 01:02:37,379
I suggest you apologize.

791
01:02:37,463 --> 01:02:39,006
You've been very busy.

792
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:42,342
You made your girl your CEO,
you're giving away all your stuff.

793
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:45,429
You let your friend
fly away with your suit.

794
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:46,889
Now, if I didn't know better...

795
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:48,974
You don't know better.
I didn't give it to him. He took it.

796
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:51,727
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it?

797
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:55,022
You're Iron Man and he just took it?

798
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,900
The little brother walked in there,
kicked your ass and took your suit?

799
01:02:57,983 --> 01:02:59,193
Is that possible?

800
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:01,904
Well, according to Mr. Stark's
database security guidelines,

801
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:04,990
there are redundancies
to prevent unauthorized usage.

802
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:10,412
- What do you want from me?
- What do we want from you?

803
01:03:10,496 --> 01:03:12,372
What do you want from me?

804
01:03:12,456 --> 01:03:16,126
You have become a problem,
a problem I have to deal with.

805
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:19,463
Contrary to your belief,
you are not the center of my universe.

806
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:22,591
I have bigger problems than you
in the southwest region to deal with.

807
01:03:22,674 --> 01:03:23,717
Hit him.

808
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:28,263
Oh, God, are you gonna
steal my kidney and sell it?

809
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:31,642
Could you please not do anything awful
for five seconds?

810
01:03:32,226 --> 01:03:35,854
- What did she just do to me?
- What did we just do for you?

811
01:03:35,938 --> 01:03:38,357
That's lithium dioxide.
It's gonna take the edge off.

812
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,317
We're trying to get you back to work.

813
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,486
Give me a couple of boxes of that.
I'll be right as rain.

814
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,488
It's not a cure,
it just abates the symptoms.

815
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:47,074
Doesn't look like it's gonna be
an easy fix.

816
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,368
Trust me, I know. I'm good at this stuff.

817
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:51,828
I've been looking for a suitable
replacement for palladium.

818
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:56,333
I've tried every combination, every
permutation of every known element.

819
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:59,503
Well, I'm here to tell you,
you haven't tried them all.

820
01:04:00,963 --> 01:04:04,091
Hey, hey, hey. Special delivery.

821
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:05,717
Candygram.

822
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,390
I brought you something.

823
01:04:11,974 --> 01:04:13,725
Oh, yeah.

824
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:18,105
We got you the bird, pal.

825
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:19,523
This is not my bird.

826
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:22,025
What do you mean?
That's the bird. This is the bird.

827
01:04:22,109 --> 01:04:24,903
Yeah. Pulled a lot of strings
to get this bird.

828
01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:26,280
This is a great bird.

829
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:28,991
- It's a beautiful bird.
- We got this all the way from Russia.

830
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:31,535
Hey, man, this not my bird.

831
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:37,791
Well, listen, even if it's not the bird,
I mean, this is a gorgeous bird.

832
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,669
I mean, you know, look,
don't get so attached to things.

833
01:04:40,752 --> 01:04:42,462
Learn to let go.

834
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:47,718
Wait a minute. Jack, what is that?

835
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:51,388
Is that... That's not a helmet.
What is that?

836
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:03,442
Ivan... What's this? Jack.

837
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:06,445
Is that a helmet?
It doesn't look like a helmet to me.

838
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:09,114
How... How are you supposed
to get a head in there?

839
01:05:09,197 --> 01:05:11,033
- Jack, could you put your head in there?
- No.

840
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:14,328
Try to put your head in there.
Go ahead. Try to put your head in there.

841
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:17,080
See, Ivan?
He can't put his head in there.

842
01:05:17,164 --> 01:05:21,543
That's... That's not a helmet. It's a head.
I need to put a guy in there.

843
01:05:21,627 --> 01:05:25,005
I need to fit a person in that suit.
You understand?

844
01:05:25,339 --> 01:05:27,466
- Drone better.
- What? Drone better?

845
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:30,135
Why is drone better?
Why is drone better?

846
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:32,012
People make problem.

847
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:33,972
Trust me. Drone better.

848
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:38,602
Ivan, you know, I like you.
I got you the bird.

849
01:05:39,478 --> 01:05:41,313
You said, "No problem."

850
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:44,316
That's what you said to me.
You said, "No problem."

851
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:47,194
Now I need suits.
The government wants suits.

852
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:49,279
Like Iron Man. You understand?

853
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:52,491
That's what the people want.
That's what's gonna make them happy.

854
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:54,660
Hey, man.

855
01:05:56,203 --> 01:05:58,789
Don't get too attached to things.

856
01:05:59,498 --> 01:06:01,208
Learn to let go.

857
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:07,297
These drones
better steal the show, Ivan.

858
01:06:07,923 --> 01:06:11,343
You understand?
Better rock my world, Ivan.

859
01:06:20,936 --> 01:06:22,604
Unbelievable.

860
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:25,732
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.

861
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:29,194
- It's functional?
- Fully mission-capable.

862
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:32,948
Good. Get Hammer down here
to weaponize it.

863
01:06:33,949 --> 01:06:34,991
Sir?

864
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:37,703
Justin Hammer's making
a weapons presentation at the Expo.

865
01:06:37,786 --> 01:06:39,413
We'd like this to introduce it.

866
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,081
Sir, I don't believe that the Expo...

867
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:43,959
Colonel, the world needs
to see this fast.

868
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:47,087
- We've got to make this happen.
- Yes, General, but...

869
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:49,172
It's also an order.

870
01:06:49,548 --> 01:06:50,882
Yes, sir.

871
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:54,720
Good work, Colonel.
You've made your country proud.

872
01:06:54,803 --> 01:06:56,430
Thank you, sir.

873
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:06,314
That thing in your chest
is based on unfinished technology.

874
01:07:06,398 --> 01:07:07,441
No, it was finished.

875
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:11,653
It has never been particularly effective
until I miniaturized it and put it in my...

876
01:07:11,737 --> 01:07:13,864
No. Howard said the arc reactor

877
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:15,699
was the stepping stone
to something greater.

878
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:20,287
He was about to kick off an energy race
that was gonna <i>dwarf</i> the arms race.

879
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:21,913
He was on to something big,

880
01:07:21,997 --> 01:07:25,459
something so big that it was gonna
make the nuclear reactor

881
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,544
look like a triple-A battery.

882
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:30,130
Just him,
or was Anton Vanko in on this, too?

883
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:33,300
Anton Vanko
is the other side of that coin.

884
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:35,427
Anton saw it as a way to get rich.

885
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:37,888
When your father found out,
he had him deported.

886
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:39,890
When the Russians found out
he couldn't deliver,

887
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:41,516
they shipped his ass off to Siberia

888
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,352
and he spent the next 20 years
in a vodka-fuel led rage.

889
01:07:44,436 --> 01:07:46,980
Not quite the environment
you want to raise a kid in,

890
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:51,193
the son you had the misfortune
of crossing paths with in Monaco.

891
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:52,903
You told me I hadn't tried everything.

892
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:55,197
What do you mean I haven't
tried everything? What haven't I tried?

893
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,534
He said that you were the only person
with the means and knowledge

894
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,661
to finish what he started.

895
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:03,246
He said that?

896
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:06,041
Are you that guy? Are you?

897
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:11,421
'Cause if you are, then you can solve
the riddle of your heart.

898
01:08:15,717 --> 01:08:17,177
I don't know
where you get your information,

899
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,513
but he wasn't my biggest fan.

900
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:20,972
What do you remember
about your dad?

901
01:08:21,056 --> 01:08:22,766
He was cold, he was calculating.

902
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:25,602
He never told me he loved me.
He never even told me he liked me,

903
01:08:25,685 --> 01:08:27,270
so it's a little tough for me to digest

904
01:08:27,354 --> 01:08:29,815
when you're telling me he said
the whole future was riding on me

905
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:32,859
and he's passing it down.
I don't get that.

906
01:08:32,943 --> 01:08:34,194
You're talking about a guy
whose happiest day

907
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:35,779
was when he shipped me
off to boarding school.

908
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:36,947
That's not true.

909
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:39,699
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad
better than I did.

910
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:43,787
As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of
the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D.

911
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:45,038
What?

912
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,666
- I got a 2:00.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

913
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:49,292
- What's this?
- Okay, you're good, right?

914
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:51,127
- No, I'm not good.
- You got this? Right? Right?

915
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:53,088
Got what? I don't even know
what I'm supposed to get.

916
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:56,424
Natasha will remain a floater at Stark
with her cover intact.

917
01:08:56,508 --> 01:08:59,427
- You remember Agent Coulson, right?
- Yeah.

918
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:01,346
And Tony,

919
01:09:02,556 --> 01:09:05,600
remember, I got my eye on you.

920
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:14,901
We've disabled all communications.
No contact with the outside world.

921
01:09:14,985 --> 01:09:16,361
Good luck.

922
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:21,700
Please.

923
01:09:22,284 --> 01:09:25,495
First thing, I need a little bodywork.
I'll put in a little time at the lab.

924
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:27,747
If we could send one of your goon squad
down to The Coffee Bean,

925
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:30,417
Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run,
or something like that, that'd be nice.

926
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,626
I'm not here for that.

927
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:33,169
I've been authorized by Director Fury

928
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:35,714
to use any means necessary
to keep you on premises.

929
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:38,425
If you attempt to leave
or play any games,

930
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:41,720
I will tase you and watch <i>Supernanny</i>
while you drool into the carpet.

931
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:44,055
- Okay?
- I think I got it, yeah.

932
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:46,016
Enjoy your evening's entertainment.

933
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:14,002
Think this is the power source?

934
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:18,882
Major, this is not a scientific exercise.
Let's just focus on arming it, all right?

935
01:10:20,008 --> 01:10:21,343
Yes, sir.

936
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,053
Oh, yes!

937
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:25,388
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

938
01:10:25,472 --> 01:10:27,223
Is it my birthday?

939
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:30,936
You got it.
What did you do? What did you do?

940
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:36,900
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes, it is.

941
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:40,070
Hammer, I want to know
what you're gonna do for us.

942
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,738
What am I going to do for you?

943
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:44,574
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do for you
is I'm gonna upgrade your software.

944
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:47,953
- And then, second, I think I should...
- That's not what I'm talking about.

945
01:10:48,036 --> 01:10:50,372
I'm talking about firepower.

946
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:53,959
Well, you're talking to the right guy.

947
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:58,546
Claridge Hi-Tec,
semi-automatic, 9mm pistol.

948
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,175
Too downtown? I agree.

949
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,970
M24 shotgun, pump action.

950
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:06,888
Five-round magazine.

951
01:11:06,972 --> 01:11:08,306
You know what? You're not a hunter.

952
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:10,475
What am I talking about?
I'm getting rid of it.

953
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:13,019
This is the FN-2000 from Belgium.

954
01:11:13,103 --> 01:11:15,397
They do make something
better than waffles.

955
01:11:16,231 --> 01:11:18,358
It's beautiful, but I can tell
this isn't disco enough for you,

956
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:19,734
so I'm gonna put it right here.

957
01:11:19,818 --> 01:11:22,862
You're looking at
a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher.

958
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:25,991
Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control.

959
01:11:26,241 --> 01:11:27,575
You're tough.

960
01:11:27,659 --> 01:11:30,161
Let me tell you something.
Size does matter.

961
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:31,746
Don't let anyone tell you different.

962
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:35,458
This is an M134 7.62 Minigun.

963
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:39,004
Six individual barrels.
The torso taker, powder maker.

964
01:11:39,087 --> 01:11:41,214
Our boys in uniform call it
Uncle Gazpacho,

965
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,675
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

966
01:11:46,678 --> 01:11:47,762
Okay.

967
01:11:49,681 --> 01:11:53,476
These are the Cubans, baby.
This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos.

968
01:11:55,145 --> 01:11:57,063
This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle

969
01:11:57,147 --> 01:12:01,443
with a secondary
cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst.

970
01:12:02,027 --> 01:12:05,530
It's capable of busting the bunker
under the bunker you just busted.

971
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:07,782
If it were any smarter,
it would write a book.

972
01:12:07,866 --> 01:12:11,286
A book that would make <i>Ulysses</i>
look like it was written in crayon.

973
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:13,121
It would read it to you.

974
01:12:13,788 --> 01:12:15,290
This is my Eiffel Tower.

975
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:18,460
This is my Rachmaninoff's <i>Third.</i>
My <i>Pietá.</i>

976
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:21,629
It's completely elegant.
It's bafflingly beautiful.

977
01:12:21,713 --> 01:12:26,426
It's capable of reducing the population
of any standing structure to zero.

978
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,429
I call it the Ex-Wife.

979
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,478
That's the best I got.

980
01:12:41,566 --> 01:12:43,234
Are we gonna do this?
Give me something here.

981
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:47,280
- You're like a sphinx. I can't read you.
- I think I'll take it.

982
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:50,241
- Which one?
- All of it.

983
01:12:52,202 --> 01:12:53,244
All of it.

984
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:34,285
<i>Everything is achievable
through technology.</i>

985
01:13:34,536 --> 01:13:36,913
<i>Better living, robust health</i>

986
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:42,836
<i>and for the first time in human history,
the possibility of world peace.</i>

987
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:44,587
<i>I'm Howard Stark,</i>

988
01:13:44,671 --> 01:13:48,675
<i>and everything you'll need for the future
can be found right here.</i>

989
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,803
<i>City of the Future?
City of Tomorrow? City of..</i>

990
01:13:57,642 --> 01:13:58,768
<i>I'm Howard Stark,</i>

991
01:13:58,852 --> 01:14:02,772
<i>and everything you'll need in the future
can be found right here.</i>

992
01:14:02,856 --> 01:14:05,692
<i>So, from all of us at Stark Industries,</i>

993
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:08,111
<i>I would like to personally...</i>

994
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:10,947
<i>Tony, what are you doing back there?
What is that?</i>

995
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:14,659
<i>Put that back.
Put it back where you got it from.</i>

996
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:17,036
<i>Where's your mother? Maria?</i>

997
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,372
<i>Go on. Go, go, go, go.</i>

998
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:23,877
<i>All right, I think we got...</i>

999
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,045
<i>I'll... I'll... I'll come in and...</i>

1000
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:31,885
<i>Are you waiting on me?</i>

1001
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:38,308
<i>So, from all of us at Stark Industries,
I'd like to personally show you</i>

1002
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:40,143
<i>my ass.</i>

1003
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:42,312
<i>I'd like to... I can't... This is...</i>

1004
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:44,731
<i>I can't... We have this, don't we?</i>

1005
01:14:44,856 --> 01:14:47,817
<i>This is a ridiculous way...</i>

1006
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:49,736
<i>Everything</i>

1007
01:14:50,737 --> 01:14:52,238
<i>is achievable</i>

1008
01:14:53,031 --> 01:14:54,908
<i>through technology.</i>

1009
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:08,504
<i>Tony?</i>

1010
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:10,506
<i>You're too young
to understand this right now,</i>

1011
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:13,593
<i>so I thought
I would put it on film for you.</i>

1012
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:17,263
<i>I built this for you.</i>

1013
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:20,850
<i>And someday you'll realize
that it represents a whole lot more</i>

1014
01:15:20,934 --> 01:15:24,938
<i>than just people's inventions.
It represents my life's work.</i>

1015
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:28,441
<i>This is the key to the future.</i>

1016
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:36,199
<i>I'm limited by the technology of my time,
but one day you'll figure this out.</i>

1017
01:15:37,075 --> 01:15:38,785
<i>And when you do,</i>

1018
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:41,788
<i>you will change the world.</i>

1019
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:47,210
<i>What is and always will be
my greatest creation</i>

1020
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:50,964
<i>is you.</i>

1021
01:16:11,943 --> 01:16:14,737
- $6. Six.
- I don't have any dough.

1022
01:16:14,821 --> 01:16:16,406
- Here.
- No, sir, that's too much.

1023
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:17,657
No, it's fine. Take that.

1024
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:19,784
- It's fine.
- No, <i>señor.</i>

1025
01:16:19,993 --> 01:16:22,996
Take it. Take it.
I don't like people handing me things.

1026
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:24,998
If you just drop that there,
that'd be great.

1027
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:27,959
- Are you Iron Man?
- Sometimes.

1028
01:16:28,126 --> 01:16:29,836
We believe in you.

1029
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:33,006
It was an illegal seizure
of trademark property.

1030
01:16:33,423 --> 01:16:34,507
- Miss Potts?
- Relax.

1031
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:35,675
- Mr. Stark...
- Is here.

1032
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:37,593
- He refuses...
- I don't. It's fine.

1033
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:40,263
- I'll just be a second.
- Listen, it's our position

1034
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:42,598
that Stark has and continues to maintain

1035
01:16:42,682 --> 01:16:45,435
proprietary ownership
of the Mark ll platform.

1036
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:48,271
<i>When Mr. Stark announced
he was indeed Iron Man,</i>

1037
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:50,523
- <i>he was making a promise to America.</i>
- No, the suit belongs to us.

1038
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:52,525
<i>We trusted that he would look out for us.</i>

1039
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:54,694
- Yeah, but you're not... Burt...
- <i>He obviously did not.</i>

1040
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:57,113
- <i>And now we learn that his secretary...</i>
- Yes, it does.

1041
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:59,532
<i>...a woman named
Virginia "Pepper" Potts,</i>

1042
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:02,368
<i>has been appointed
as CEO of Stark Industries.</i>

1043
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:03,953
<i>What are her qualifications?</i>

1044
01:17:04,037 --> 01:17:05,121
- No.
- <i>Ms. Potts is doing</i>

1045
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:06,372
<i>nothing to manage this terrible...</i>

1046
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:07,957
- Mute.
- No...

1047
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:10,793
Burt... Burt... Burt, listen to me.

1048
01:17:10,877 --> 01:17:13,296
Don't tell me that we have
the best patent lawyers in the country

1049
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:15,506
and then not let me pursue this.

1050
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:16,966
I'll get this stuff out of here.

1051
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:19,886
Well, then, tell the President
to sign an order.

1052
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:22,138
We'll talk about it at the Expo.

1053
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:25,224
Hammer's giving some presentation
tomorrow evening.

1054
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:28,186
- Will Tony Stark be there?
- Will I?

1055
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:31,064
- No, he will not. Bye.
- I would like to be.

1056
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:33,399
- Got a minute?
- No.

1057
01:17:33,524 --> 01:17:36,235
Come on, you just got off the phone.
You're fine, 30 seconds.

1058
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:39,989
Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight.

1059
01:17:40,073 --> 01:17:41,741
I was just driving over here,

1060
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:44,327
and I thought I was coming
to basically apologize, but I'm not.

1061
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:47,163
- You didn't come here to apologize?
- Look, that goes without saying,

1062
01:17:47,246 --> 01:17:48,831
and I'm working on that.

1063
01:17:48,915 --> 01:17:52,919
But I haven't been
entirely upfront with you,

1064
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:54,170
and I just want to try to make good.

1065
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,589
Can I move this? This is crazy.

1066
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:57,757
It's like a Ferris wheel going.

1067
01:17:57,882 --> 01:17:59,008
- I'm trying to get some...
- No.

1068
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:04,097
Do you know how short life is?

1069
01:18:04,222 --> 01:18:07,266
And if I never got to express...

1070
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:10,019
And by the way,
this is somewhat revelatory to me.

1071
01:18:10,103 --> 01:18:12,522
And I don't care...
I mean, I care. It would be nice.

1072
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:14,273
I'm not expecting you to...

1073
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:15,525
Look, here's what I'm trying to say.

1074
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:17,443
- I'm just gonna say it.
- Let me stop you right here, okay?

1075
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:20,029
Because if you say "I" one more time,

1076
01:18:20,113 --> 01:18:22,907
I'm gonna actually hurl something
at your head, I think.

1077
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:25,368
I am trying to run a company.

1078
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:28,037
- Do you have any idea what that entails?
- Yes.

1079
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:31,124
People are relying on you to be Iron Man
and you've disappeared,

1080
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:34,544
and all I'm doing is putting out your fires
and taking the heat for it.

1081
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:40,633
I am trying to do the job
that you were meant to do.

1082
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:46,722
Did you bring me strawberries?

1083
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:51,227
Did you know that there's only
one thing on Earth that I'm allergic to?

1084
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:53,604
Allergic to strawberries.

1085
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:57,150
This is progress, Pepper.

1086
01:18:57,275 --> 01:18:59,986
I knew there was a correlation
between you and this.

1087
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:02,155
- I need you...
- I need you, too.

1088
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:04,907
- ...to leave now.
- That's what I'm trying to...

1089
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,497
Ms. Potts?

1090
01:19:12,123 --> 01:19:15,459
- Hi, come on in.
- Wheels up in 25 minutes.

1091
01:19:16,002 --> 01:19:17,336
Thank you.

1092
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:20,590
- Anything else, boss?
- I'm good, Hap.

1093
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:23,801
No, I'll be just...another minute.

1094
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:26,429
I lost both the kids in the divorce.

1095
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:31,767
No.

1096
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:39,025
Are you blending in well here, Natalie?
Here at Stark Enterprises?

1097
01:19:40,193 --> 01:19:42,445
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?

1098
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:45,448
I thought you two didn't get along.

1099
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:48,868
- No. That's not so.
- It's just me you don't care for.

1100
01:19:49,035 --> 01:19:51,454
- No? Nothing?
- Actually, while you're here,

1101
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:54,624
maybe you and Natalie could discuss
the matter of the personal belongings.

1102
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:56,167
Absolutely.

1103
01:20:02,632 --> 01:20:03,633
I'm surprised
you can keep your mouth shut.

1104
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:04,800
Boy, you're good.

1105
01:20:04,884 --> 01:20:07,470
You are mind-blowingly duplicitous.
How do you do it?

1106
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:09,388
You just tear things...
You're a triple impostor.

1107
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:11,724
I've never seen anything like you.
Is there anything real about you?

1108
01:20:11,849 --> 01:20:12,892
Do you even speak Latin?

1109
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:17,730
Which means? Wait. What?
What did you just say?

1110
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:21,067
It means you can either drive yourself
home or I can have you collected.

1111
01:20:22,652 --> 01:20:24,070
You're good.

1112
01:21:23,838 --> 01:21:26,507
Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form
a digital wire frame?

1113
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:29,135
I need a manipulatable projection.

1114
01:21:36,434 --> 01:21:39,979
<i>1974 Stark Expo
model scan complete, sir.</i>

1115
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:44,025
How many buildings are there?

1116
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:46,569
<i>Am I to include
the Belgian waffle stands?</i>

1117
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:49,196
That was rhetorical. Just show me.

1118
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:06,589
What does that look like to you, Jarvis?
Not unlike an atom.

1119
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:10,176
In which case the nucleus
would be here.

1120
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:13,346
Highlight the unisphere.

1121
01:22:22,146 --> 01:22:27,151
- Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.
- <i>What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?</i>

1122
01:22:27,234 --> 01:22:29,070
I'm discovering... Correction.

1123
01:22:29,195 --> 01:22:33,157
I'm rediscovering a new element,
I believe.

1124
01:22:33,908 --> 01:22:36,952
Lose the landscaping,
the shrubbery, the trees.

1125
01:22:37,036 --> 01:22:39,372
Parking lots, exits, entrances.

1126
01:22:44,168 --> 01:22:50,174
Structure the protons and the neutrons
using the pavilions as a framework.

1127
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:54,387
Dad.

1128
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:20,413
Dead for almost 20 years,
and still taking me to school.

1129
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:31,215
<i>The proposed element should serve
as a viable replacement for palladium.</i>

1130
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:32,383
Thanks, Dad.

1131
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:35,719
<i>Unfortunately, it is impossible
to synthesize.</i>

1132
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:43,811
Get ready for a major remodel, fellas.
We're back in hardware mode.

1133
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:33,944
- I heard you broke the perimeter.
- Yeah.

1134
01:24:34,028 --> 01:24:35,946
That was, like, three years ago.
Where you been?

1135
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:40,034
- I was doing some stuff.
- Yeah, well, me, too, and it worked.

1136
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:42,119
Hey, I'm playing for
the home team, Coulson,

1137
01:24:42,203 --> 01:24:44,288
you and all your
Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.

1138
01:24:44,371 --> 01:24:46,165
Now, are you gonna let me work
or break my balls?

1139
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,502
What's this doing here?

1140
01:24:52,338 --> 01:24:53,380
That's it.

1141
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:56,800
- Bring that to me.
- You know what this is?

1142
01:24:56,884 --> 01:24:58,385
It's exactly what I need
to make this work.

1143
01:25:00,346 --> 01:25:01,388
Lift the coil.

1144
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:03,224
Go, go. Put your knees into it.

1145
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:05,851
There you go. And...

1146
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:08,812
Drop it. Drop it.

1147
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:15,069
Perfectly level.
I'm busy. What do you want?

1148
01:25:15,194 --> 01:25:18,364
Nothing. Goodbye. I've been reassigned.

1149
01:25:18,906 --> 01:25:20,491
Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.

1150
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:23,035
- Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
- So I'm told.

1151
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,204
- Secret stuff?
- Something like that.

1152
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:27,623
- Good luck.
- Bye.

1153
01:25:27,706 --> 01:25:29,792
- Thanks.
- We need you.

1154
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:32,878
- Yeah, more than you know.
- Not that much.

1155
01:25:51,230 --> 01:25:53,857
<i>Initializing prismatic accelerator.</i>

1156
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:02,366
<i>Approaching maximum power.</i>

1157
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:51,081
That was easy.

1158
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:09,600
<i>Congratulations, sir.</i>

1159
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:13,812
<i>You have created a new element.</i>

1160
01:27:21,779 --> 01:27:25,574
<i>Sir, the reactor has accepted
the modified core.</i>

1161
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:28,285
<i>I will begin running diagnostics.</i>

1162
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:35,501
Hey, Ivan.

1163
01:27:35,793 --> 01:27:37,419
<i>I got Senator Stern here.</i>

1164
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:39,838
<i>Thought we'd swing over
and look at some of the drone designs.</i>

1165
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:42,216
The drone is not going to be ready.

1166
01:27:42,508 --> 01:27:43,717
Not ready? What do you mean?

1167
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:47,262
I can make presentation,
not demonstration.

1168
01:27:47,346 --> 01:27:49,348
What the hell is the difference?

1169
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:52,226
Presentation. No fly. No shoot.

1170
01:27:52,518 --> 01:27:54,353
Well, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

1171
01:27:54,478 --> 01:27:57,564
What can you make them do? I mean,
this is a weapons demonstration.

1172
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:00,984
- I can make salute.
- <i>You can make salute?</i>

1173
01:28:01,068 --> 01:28:02,444
What do you mean, "make salute"?

1174
01:28:02,528 --> 01:28:06,615
<i>What the hell does that mean, Ivan?
This is not what we agreed to, okay?</i>

1175
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:09,326
<i>You promised me suits
and then you promised me drones.</i>

1176
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:13,539
- Hey, man, everything will be okay.
- <i>This is not what I wanted.</i>

1177
01:28:25,676 --> 01:28:28,262
Hey, there he is. It's the bird man.

1178
01:28:29,847 --> 01:28:35,436
Now you like the bird. Is that right?
Is that your bird? I'm confused.

1179
01:28:36,395 --> 01:28:39,773
You said it wasn't,
but now it looks like you're best of pals.

1180
01:28:39,898 --> 01:28:43,777
You love that bird, don't you?
You know what? Take the bird.

1181
01:28:45,571 --> 01:28:46,738
Hey!

1182
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:51,452
Take his pillows, too. Both of them.

1183
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,663
And his shoes. Take his shoes.

1184
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,419
I took your stuff.

1185
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:03,672
How does that make you feel?
Do you feel bad?

1186
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:07,092
Good. 'Cause that's how I feel!

1187
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:10,929
We had a contract.

1188
01:29:11,472 --> 01:29:13,307
I saved your life

1189
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:16,101
and you give me suits.

1190
01:29:16,602 --> 01:29:18,353
That was our deal.

1191
01:29:18,437 --> 01:29:20,481
And you did not deliver.

1192
01:29:21,315 --> 01:29:25,819
I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud.
I don't know what you are.

1193
01:29:28,155 --> 01:29:31,492
Something really, really great
fell into my lap.

1194
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:35,329
And if it hadn't,
I'd be at your mercy tonight.

1195
01:29:35,621 --> 01:29:39,374
Now I have a piece of Stark tech
that I pimped out myself.

1196
01:29:39,625 --> 01:29:41,376
And now your overpriced paperweights

1197
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:44,046
are gonna look like a backdrop
to my demonstration.

1198
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:46,798
Do you dig what I'm getting at here?

1199
01:29:49,009 --> 01:29:53,305
I don't know if you know this,
but I don't speak Russian!

1200
01:29:56,683 --> 01:29:58,560
I'm gonna leave now.

1201
01:29:58,644 --> 01:30:01,730
I'm gonna go to the Expo.
Maybe I'll even get laid.

1202
01:30:02,481 --> 01:30:04,316
You see these guys?
They're your babysitters.

1203
01:30:04,483 --> 01:30:06,985
They are not to be trifled with.

1204
01:30:07,361 --> 01:30:09,238
When I get back,
we're gonna renegotiate

1205
01:30:09,321 --> 01:30:11,657
the terms of our agreement.

1206
01:30:12,241 --> 01:30:14,326
And you're gonna make good
on our arrangement

1207
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:15,953
because if you don't,

1208
01:30:16,036 --> 01:30:18,455
you're gonna be exactly what you were
when I found you,

1209
01:30:18,539 --> 01:30:20,207
a dead man.

1210
01:30:20,332 --> 01:30:21,708
You got that?

1211
01:30:22,668 --> 01:30:25,003
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

1212
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:36,807
Dummy, you, can we clean up
this mess? You're killing me.

1213
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:38,308
- You know I don't...
- <i>incoming call</i>

1214
01:30:38,392 --> 01:30:40,143
<i>with a blocked number, sir.</i>

1215
01:30:40,227 --> 01:30:43,438
My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely.

1216
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:44,982
Coulson.
How's the Land of Enchantment?

1217
01:30:45,065 --> 01:30:47,776
<i>Hey, Tony, how you doing?</i>

1218
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:51,405
- <i>I double cycle.</i>
- You what?

1219
01:30:52,406 --> 01:30:56,285
You told me double cycle's more power.
Good advice.

1220
01:30:56,618 --> 01:30:58,287
You sound pretty sprightly
for a dead guy.

1221
01:30:58,370 --> 01:30:59,871
<i>You, too.</i>

1222
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:03,792
- Trace him.
- <i>Sir.</i>

1223
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:07,629
Now, the true history of Stark name
will be written.

1224
01:31:07,713 --> 01:31:08,797
Jarvis, where is he?

1225
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:13,010
<i>Accessing the Oracle grid.
Eastern Seaboard.</i>

1226
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:17,222
What your father did
to my family over 40 years,

1227
01:31:18,056 --> 01:31:20,726
I will do to you in 40 minutes.

1228
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:22,811
Sounds good.
Let's get together and hash it out.

1229
01:31:23,103 --> 01:31:24,438
<i>Tri-State area.</i>

1230
01:31:24,563 --> 01:31:26,773
<i>Manhattan and outlying boroughs.</i>

1231
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:28,775
I hope you're ready.

1232
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:33,572
<i>Call trace incomplete.</i>

1233
01:31:44,124 --> 01:31:46,752
- <i>Sir...</i>
- You want to run some tests, run them.

1234
01:31:47,753 --> 01:31:49,713
And assemble the suit while you're at it.
Put it together now.

1235
01:31:49,796 --> 01:31:52,257
- <i>We are unclear as to the effects...</i>
- I don't want to hear it, Jarvis.

1236
01:31:56,637 --> 01:31:58,722
That tastes like coconut.

1237
01:31:58,805 --> 01:32:00,515
And metal.

1238
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:02,434
Oh, wow, yeah!

1239
01:32:15,030 --> 01:32:16,865
I'll keep the car down here, all right?

1240
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:18,241
Thank you, Happy.

1241
01:32:18,325 --> 01:32:23,121
<i>...Justin Hammer. His presentation
will begin shortly in the main pavilion.</i>

1242
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:42,808
<i>Yeah.</i>

1243
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:47,312
<i>That's what I'm talking about.
Thanks for coming.</i>

1244
01:32:47,896 --> 01:32:49,856
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long,</i>

1245
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:54,486
<i>this country has had to place its
brave men and women in harm's way,</i>

1246
01:32:54,653 --> 01:32:56,279
<i>but then the Iron Man arrived,</i>

1247
01:32:56,363 --> 01:33:00,033
<i>and we thought the days
of losing lives were behind us.</i>

1248
01:33:00,867 --> 01:33:03,620
<i>Sadly, that technology
was kept out of reach.</i>

1249
01:33:03,704 --> 01:33:06,039
<i>That's not fair. That's not right.</i>

1250
01:33:06,123 --> 01:33:08,375
- <i>And it's just too bad.</i>
- Oh, Lord.

1251
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:10,544
<i>Regardless, it was
an impressive innovation,</i>

1252
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:13,547
<i>one that grabbed headlines
the world over.</i>

1253
01:33:13,922 --> 01:33:15,549
<i>Well, today, my friends,</i>

1254
01:33:15,632 --> 01:33:19,094
<i>the press is faced
with quite a different problem.</i>

1255
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:22,097
<i>They are about to run out of ink.</i>

1256
01:33:27,644 --> 01:33:29,604
Get that out of here.

1257
01:33:30,564 --> 01:33:32,441
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1258
01:33:33,483 --> 01:33:35,861
<i>today I present to you</i>

1259
01:33:36,153 --> 01:33:39,322
<i>the new face
of the United States military.</i>

1260
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:41,992
<i>The Hammer drone.</i>

1261
01:33:44,536 --> 01:33:45,954
<i>Army!</i>

1262
01:33:59,092 --> 01:34:00,260
<i>Navy!</i>

1263
01:34:10,479 --> 01:34:11,938
<i>Air Force!</i>

1264
01:34:19,821 --> 01:34:21,114
<i>Marines!</i>

1265
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:34,169
<i>Yeah!</i>

1266
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:35,629
<i>Yeah!</i>

1267
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:42,010
<i>That's a hell of a lot better
than some cheerleaders, let me tell you.</i>

1268
01:34:43,345 --> 01:34:46,223
<i>But as revolutionary
as this technology is,</i>

1269
01:34:46,306 --> 01:34:50,018
<i>there will always be a need form an
to be present in the theater of war.</i>

1270
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:53,647
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
today I am proud to present to you</i>

1271
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:55,482
<i>the very first prototype</i>

1272
01:34:55,565 --> 01:34:58,860
<i>in the Variable Threat Response
Battle Suit</i>

1273
01:34:58,944 --> 01:35:02,781
<i>and its pilot, Air Force
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.</i>

1274
01:35:04,324 --> 01:35:05,575
What?

1275
01:35:26,555 --> 01:35:29,724
<i>For America and its allies,
Hammer Industries is reporting for...</i>

1276
01:35:46,783 --> 01:35:48,451
We got trouble.

1277
01:35:48,535 --> 01:35:50,245
Tony, there are civilians present.

1278
01:35:50,328 --> 01:35:52,956
I'm here on orders.
Let's not do this right now.

1279
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:54,332
Give them a wave.

1280
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:56,585
<i>Hey, all right. Yeah.</i>

1281
01:35:56,668 --> 01:35:58,712
All these people are in danger.
We gotta get them out of here.

1282
01:35:58,795 --> 01:36:00,797
You gotta trust me
for the next five minutes.

1283
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,966
Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed
around your house, remember?

1284
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:05,093
Listen, I think he's working with Vanko.

1285
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:06,803
Vanko's alive?

1286
01:36:08,013 --> 01:36:09,180
<i>Yeah.</i>

1287
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:10,515
Where is he?

1288
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:12,892
- What?
- Where's Vanko?

1289
01:36:13,351 --> 01:36:14,644
- Who?
- Tell me.

1290
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:17,272
What are you doing here, man?

1291
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:19,024
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1292
01:36:23,403 --> 01:36:25,822
- Is that you?
- No, I'm not doing that. That's not me.

1293
01:36:26,906 --> 01:36:29,576
I can't move. I'm locked up.
I'm locked up!

1294
01:36:30,368 --> 01:36:32,537
Get out of here. Go! This whole
system's been compromised.

1295
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:35,832
Let's take it outside.

1296
01:36:47,969 --> 01:36:49,220
No. No!

1297
01:36:59,189 --> 01:37:02,400
- Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

1298
01:37:04,235 --> 01:37:07,155
Tony, Tony, I'm locked on.
I have target lock.

1299
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:08,907
- On what?
- On you.

1300
01:37:13,912 --> 01:37:15,747
Tony, on your six!

1301
01:37:33,098 --> 01:37:35,433
- What's going on? What's happening?
- The software's been overridden.

1302
01:37:35,558 --> 01:37:36,768
What? What do you mean
it's been overridden?

1303
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:38,186
- What does that mean?
- I think he slaved the drones.

1304
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:39,354
That's impossible.

1305
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:41,106
- Call the guards.
- All the phones are down, sir.

1306
01:37:41,231 --> 01:37:43,358
Well, then call their... Call their cells.

1307
01:37:43,441 --> 01:37:44,943
Their cell phones
are not working, either, sir.

1308
01:37:45,068 --> 01:37:46,277
He's locked us out of the mainframe.

1309
01:37:46,361 --> 01:37:47,529
Who's locked you out of the mainframe?

1310
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:49,197
Please, please, go away. Go away.

1311
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,615
- I've got this handled.
- Have you now?

1312
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:51,783
Yes, I do.

1313
01:37:51,908 --> 01:37:54,369
In fact, if your guy hadn't showed up,
this wouldn't be happening.

1314
01:37:54,452 --> 01:37:56,788
So please, now go away. Thank you.

1315
01:37:57,205 --> 01:37:59,541
Listen, we got to get
these bitches out of here.

1316
01:37:59,749 --> 01:38:01,209
What?

1317
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:02,627
You tell me who's behind this.

1318
01:38:02,711 --> 01:38:07,257
- Who's behind this?
- Ivan. Ivan Vanko.

1319
01:38:07,632 --> 01:38:10,260
- Where is he?
- He's at my facility.

1320
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:15,223
- I need NYPD, please.
- No, no, no!

1321
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:16,474
- Command Central.
- No, no, honey.

1322
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:18,476
- Don't call the authorities.
- Okay. Right away. Right away.

1323
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:20,645
Step aside. Step aside.

1324
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:23,273
Tell me everything you know. Go.

1325
01:38:30,655 --> 01:38:33,658
- How are we doing, Jarvis?
- <i>Remote reboot unsuccessful.</i>

1326
01:38:51,176 --> 01:38:52,677
This way.

1327
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,180
Nobody's answering the phone.
What's going on?

1328
01:38:55,263 --> 01:38:57,515
Get in the car.
Take me to Hammer Industries.

1329
01:38:57,599 --> 01:39:00,018
- I'm not taking you anywhere.
- Fine. You want me to drive?

1330
01:39:00,101 --> 01:39:02,645
No, I'm driving. Get in the car.

1331
01:40:01,079 --> 01:40:02,747
Nice work, kid.

1332
01:40:04,541 --> 01:40:07,877
- <i>You got multiples coming in on you.</i>
- Let's get this away from the Expo.

1333
01:40:13,258 --> 01:40:15,677
When we arrive,
I need you to watch the perimeter.

1334
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:19,430
I'm gonna enter the facility
and take down the target.

1335
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:24,352
- Watch the road.
- I got it. I got it.

1336
01:40:54,757 --> 01:40:55,800
Listen, listen.

1337
01:40:55,925 --> 01:40:57,927
A pack just peeled off.
They're headed back to the Expo.

1338
01:40:58,011 --> 01:40:59,345
Got it.

1339
01:41:03,141 --> 01:41:04,601
I'm closing on you.

1340
01:41:04,684 --> 01:41:07,103
Ordnance coming in hot, Tony. Watch it.

1341
01:41:22,952 --> 01:41:25,622
- Stay in the car.
- I'm not staying in the car.

1342
01:41:25,705 --> 01:41:27,290
I said, stay in the car.

1343
01:41:27,457 --> 01:41:29,459
What are you wearing?

1344
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:33,004
Look, I'm not letting you
go in there alone.

1345
01:41:33,129 --> 01:41:34,505
You want to help? Keep the car running.

1346
01:41:34,631 --> 01:41:35,882
Okay.

1347
01:41:39,385 --> 01:41:41,679
Hey, hey, hey. You can't come in here.

1348
01:41:42,138 --> 01:41:43,681
Hold on. Hey!

1349
01:42:28,393 --> 01:42:30,311
Each set of drones is communicating

1350
01:42:30,395 --> 01:42:33,147
- in its own unique language.
- Well, choose one and focus on that.

1351
01:42:33,231 --> 01:42:35,233
Have you tried Russian?
Why don't you try Russian?

1352
01:42:38,903 --> 01:42:41,280
<i>Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.</i>

1353
01:42:41,364 --> 01:42:43,616
We got it. We're on our way.

1354
01:43:25,074 --> 01:43:26,492
I got him!

1355
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:43,384
- Rhodey, you still locked on?
- Yeah.

1356
01:43:43,468 --> 01:43:46,971
Drop your socks and grab your Croce.
We're about to get wet on this ride.

1357
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:50,266
Wait, wait, wait!

1358
01:44:09,827 --> 01:44:11,287
He's gone.

1359
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:17,376
I'm sorry, buddy.
Had to thin out the herd.

1360
01:44:18,169 --> 01:44:20,004
What's your 20?

1361
01:44:31,641 --> 01:44:34,477
- What are you doing?
- I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.

1362
01:44:40,858 --> 01:44:41,901
Tony!

1363
01:44:58,417 --> 01:45:00,086
Reboot complete.

1364
01:45:00,753 --> 01:45:02,505
You got your best friend back.

1365
01:45:02,588 --> 01:45:05,967
- <i>Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff</i>
- Well done with the new chest piece.

1366
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:09,720
I am reading significantly higher output
and your vitals all look promising.

1367
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:12,557
<i>Yes, for the moment, I'm not dying.
Thank you.</i>

1368
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,725
<i>What do you mean you're not dying?
Did you just say you're dying?</i>

1369
01:45:14,809 --> 01:45:16,561
<i>Is that you? No, I'm not.</i>

1370
01:45:16,644 --> 01:45:18,187
<i>-Not anymore.
- What's going on?</i>

1371
01:45:18,271 --> 01:45:20,022
<i>I was going to tell you.
I didn't want to alarm you.</i>

1372
01:45:20,106 --> 01:45:21,607
<i>You were gonna tell me?
You really were dying?</i>

1373
01:45:21,732 --> 01:45:23,442
<i>-You didn't let me.
- Why didn't you tell me that?</i>

1374
01:45:23,568 --> 01:45:26,279
<i>I was gonna make you an omelet
and tell you.</i>

1375
01:45:26,404 --> 01:45:29,323
Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon.
You got incoming, Tony.

1376
01:45:29,407 --> 01:45:30,992
Looks like the fight's coming to you.

1377
01:45:31,075 --> 01:45:32,910
<i>-Great. Pepper?
- Are you okay now?</i>

1378
01:45:32,994 --> 01:45:34,203
<i>I am fine. Don't be mad.</i>

1379
01:45:34,287 --> 01:45:35,872
<i>-I will formally apologize...
- I am mad!</i>

1380
01:45:35,955 --> 01:45:38,916
<i>...when I'm not fending off
a Hammeroid attack.</i>

1381
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,418
<i>-Fine.
- We could have been in Venice.</i>

1382
01:45:40,501 --> 01:45:41,544
<i>Oh, please.</i>

1383
01:45:44,922 --> 01:45:46,299
<i>Rhodes?</i>

1384
01:45:46,757 --> 01:45:49,427
<i>Snap out of it, buddy. I need you.</i>

1385
01:45:50,178 --> 01:45:52,471
<i>They're coming.
Come on, let's roll. Get up.</i>

1386
01:45:55,766 --> 01:45:57,935
Oh, man. You can have your suit back.

1387
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:02,773
You okay?

1388
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:04,483
Yeah, thanks.

1389
01:46:06,027 --> 01:46:08,446
- Tony, look, I'm sorry, okay?
- Don't be.

1390
01:46:08,529 --> 01:46:09,739
No. I should have trusted you more.

1391
01:46:09,822 --> 01:46:11,407
I'm the one who put you in this position.
Forget it.

1392
01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:13,826
No. It's your fault.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

1393
01:46:13,951 --> 01:46:17,205
Thank you. That's all I wanted to hear.
Partner.

1394
01:46:17,455 --> 01:46:21,042
They're coming in hot, any second.
What's the play?

1395
01:46:21,667 --> 01:46:23,294
Well, we want to take
the high ground, okay?

1396
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:24,962
So let's put the biggest gun
up on that ridge.

1397
01:46:25,046 --> 01:46:26,339
Got you.

1398
01:46:27,173 --> 01:46:28,257
- Where do you want to be?
- Where are you going?

1399
01:46:28,341 --> 01:46:29,967
- What're you talking about?
- I meant me.

1400
01:46:30,051 --> 01:46:32,053
You have a big gun.
You are not the big gun.

1401
01:46:32,136 --> 01:46:33,512
- Tony, don't be jealous.
- No. It's subtle,

1402
01:46:33,638 --> 01:46:34,764
- all the bells and whistles.
- Yeah.

1403
01:46:34,847 --> 01:46:37,350
- It's called being a badass.
- Fine.

1404
01:46:38,059 --> 01:46:41,437
All right.
You go up top. I'll draw them in.

1405
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,397
Don't stay down here.
This is the worst place to be.

1406
01:46:43,481 --> 01:46:44,732
Okay, you got a spot. Where's mine?

1407
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:47,735
It's the kill box, Tony. Okay?
This is where you go to die.

1408
01:47:37,535 --> 01:47:39,245
- See that?
- Yeah, yeah, nice.

1409
01:47:47,253 --> 01:47:48,546
Rhodey?

1410
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,382
Get down.

1411
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:04,061
Wow. I think
you should lead with that next time.

1412
01:48:04,145 --> 01:48:07,481
Yeah. Sorry, boss.
I can only use it once. It's a one-off.

1413
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:12,069
I told you that five minutes ago.

1414
01:48:13,404 --> 01:48:14,780
That's your guy here.

1415
01:48:16,115 --> 01:48:18,117
- Excuse me?
- You're being placed under arrest.

1416
01:48:18,242 --> 01:48:19,660
- Are you kidding me?
- Hands behind your back, sir.

1417
01:48:19,744 --> 01:48:21,412
I'm trying to help here.

1418
01:48:25,499 --> 01:48:29,045
I get it. I see what you're doing.
You're trying to pin this on me, huh?

1419
01:48:29,128 --> 01:48:30,713
That's good. That's good.

1420
01:48:30,796 --> 01:48:33,758
You're starting to think like a CEO,
taking out the competition.

1421
01:48:33,924 --> 01:48:36,302
I like that. You think you're making
a problem for me?

1422
01:48:36,427 --> 01:48:37,470
I'm gonna make a problem for you.

1423
01:48:37,595 --> 01:48:40,598
I'm gonna be seeing you again
real soon.

1424
01:48:44,769 --> 01:48:46,270
When they get here,
I think you should station them

1425
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:49,190
at the south, east and both west exits.

1426
01:48:49,273 --> 01:48:51,358
We shut down the 7 train
in and out of Willets Point already.

1427
01:48:51,442 --> 01:48:54,236
Well, have city buses there
to ferry people to operating lines.

1428
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:55,821
Yeah. Are you coming with us?

1429
01:48:55,946 --> 01:48:59,408
- No, I'm gonna stay till the park is clear.
- Okay.

1430
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:03,662
Heads up.
You got one more drone incoming.

1431
01:49:03,788 --> 01:49:05,122
This one looks different.

1432
01:49:05,581 --> 01:49:07,958
<i>The repulsor signature
is significantly higher.</i>

1433
01:49:19,053 --> 01:49:20,721
Good to be back.

1434
01:49:21,305 --> 01:49:22,681
This ain't gonna be good.

1435
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:28,395
I got something special for this guy.

1436
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:30,606
I'm gonna bust his bunker
with the Ex-Wife.

1437
01:49:30,689 --> 01:49:32,149
With the what?

1438
01:49:42,535 --> 01:49:45,037
- Hammer tech?
- Yeah.

1439
01:49:46,872 --> 01:49:48,457
I got this.

1440
01:50:41,385 --> 01:50:43,387
Rhodes. I got an idea.

1441
01:50:43,762 --> 01:50:46,265
- You want to be a hero?
- What?

1442
01:50:46,599 --> 01:50:49,560
I could really use a sidekick.
Put your hand up.

1443
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:51,520
- This is your idea?
- Yep.

1444
01:50:52,229 --> 01:50:54,815
I'm ready. I'm ready. Go, go, go!

1445
01:50:58,611 --> 01:50:59,695
Take it.

1446
01:51:28,265 --> 01:51:29,683
You lose.

1447
01:51:37,233 --> 01:51:39,985
All these drones are rigged to blow.
We gotta get out of here, man.

1448
01:51:40,486 --> 01:51:41,737
Pepper?

1449
01:52:21,902 --> 01:52:23,654
Oh, my God! I can't take this anymore.

1450
01:52:23,737 --> 01:52:25,155
- You can't?
- I can't take this.

1451
01:52:25,239 --> 01:52:26,657
- Look at me.
- My body, literally,

1452
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:27,992
cannot handle the stress.

1453
01:52:28,075 --> 01:52:32,579
I never know if you're gonna kill yourself
or wreck the whole company.

1454
01:52:32,663 --> 01:52:34,665
I think I did okay.

1455
01:52:34,832 --> 01:52:36,875
I quit. I'm resigning.

1456
01:52:37,501 --> 01:52:38,877
That's it.

1457
01:52:39,461 --> 01:52:42,047
What did you just say? You're done?

1458
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:46,844
That's surprising.
No, it's not surprising. I get it.

1459
01:52:47,261 --> 01:52:50,556
- You don't have to make any excuses.
- I'm... I'm... I'm not making any excuses.

1460
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:51,765
You actually were just making excuses.

1461
01:52:51,849 --> 01:52:53,350
- But you don't have to.
- No, I wasn't making an excuse.

1462
01:52:53,434 --> 01:52:54,768
- I'm actually very justified.
- Listen. Hey, hey.

1463
01:52:54,852 --> 01:52:57,187
- You deserve better.
- Well...

1464
01:52:57,271 --> 01:52:59,857
You've taken such good care of me.

1465
01:53:00,733 --> 01:53:03,152
I've been in a tough spot,
but you got me through it, so...

1466
01:53:03,235 --> 01:53:04,486
Right?

1467
01:53:04,570 --> 01:53:05,821
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1468
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:09,575
- Thank you for understanding.
- Yeah, yeah. Let's talk clean-up.

1469
01:53:09,658 --> 01:53:12,328
- I'll handle the transition. It'll be smooth.
- Okay. What about the press?

1470
01:53:12,411 --> 01:53:14,288
Because you only had
the job for a week. That's gonna seem...

1471
01:53:14,371 --> 01:53:16,081
- Well, with you it's like dog years.
- I know.

1472
01:53:16,165 --> 01:53:17,541
I mean, it's like the Presidency...

1473
01:53:30,596 --> 01:53:31,847
Weird.

1474
01:53:32,097 --> 01:53:33,599
- No, it's not weird.
- It's okay, right?

1475
01:53:33,682 --> 01:53:35,601
- Yeah.
- Run that by me again.

1476
01:53:35,684 --> 01:53:37,561
I think it was weird.

1477
01:53:37,978 --> 01:53:40,939
You guys look like two seals
fighting over a grape.

1478
01:53:41,482 --> 01:53:43,942
- I had just quit, actually.
- Yeah, so we're not...

1479
01:53:44,026 --> 01:53:46,528
You don't have to do that.
I heard the whole thing.

1480
01:53:46,612 --> 01:53:49,531
- You should get lost.
- I was here first. Get a roof.

1481
01:53:50,449 --> 01:53:52,993
- I thought you were out of one-liners.
- That's the last one.

1482
01:53:53,077 --> 01:53:55,704
- You kicked ass back there, by the way.
- Thank you. You, too.

1483
01:53:55,788 --> 01:53:58,290
Listen, my car got taken out
in the explosion,

1484
01:53:58,374 --> 01:54:01,543
so I'm gonna have to hang on
to your suit for a minute, okay?

1485
01:54:01,627 --> 01:54:03,379
Not okay. Not okay with that.

1486
01:54:03,962 --> 01:54:05,214
It wasn't a question.

1487
01:54:10,803 --> 01:54:14,139
How are you gonna resign
if I don't accept?

1488
01:54:34,618 --> 01:54:36,912
I don't think I want you looking at that.

1489
01:54:37,079 --> 01:54:39,248
I'm not sure it pertains to you anymore.

1490
01:54:39,331 --> 01:54:44,586
Now this, on the other hand,
is Agent Romanoff's assessment of you.

1491
01:54:45,838 --> 01:54:46,922
Read it.

1492
01:54:48,841 --> 01:54:52,845
"Personality overview. Mr. Stark displays
compulsive behavior."

1493
01:54:52,928 --> 01:54:55,097
In my own defense, that was last week.

1494
01:54:57,141 --> 01:54:59,977
"Prone to self-destructive tendencies."
I was dying.

1495
01:55:00,102 --> 01:55:02,688
I mean, please. And aren't we all?

1496
01:55:03,063 --> 01:55:05,899
"Textbook narcissism"?

1497
01:55:07,943 --> 01:55:09,027
Agreed.

1498
01:55:10,112 --> 01:55:11,488
Okay, here it is.

1499
01:55:11,572 --> 01:55:14,908
"Recruitment assessment
for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes."

1500
01:55:14,992 --> 01:55:17,536
- I gotta think about it.
- Read on.

1501
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:21,623
"Tony Stark not...

1502
01:55:21,707 --> 01:55:23,250
"Not recommended"?

1503
01:55:24,459 --> 01:55:25,669
That doesn't make any sense.

1504
01:55:25,752 --> 01:55:28,672
How can you approve me
but not approve me?

1505
01:55:29,339 --> 01:55:30,757
I got a new ticker.

1506
01:55:30,841 --> 01:55:33,844
I'm trying to do right by Pepper.

1507
01:55:34,428 --> 01:55:37,347
I'm in a stable-ish relationship.

1508
01:55:38,182 --> 01:55:40,058
Which leads us to believe
at this juncture

1509
01:55:40,142 --> 01:55:43,312
we'd only like to use you
as a consultant.

1510
01:55:50,235 --> 01:55:52,112
You can't afford me.

1511
01:55:54,448 --> 01:55:56,700
Then again,
I will waive my customary retainer

1512
01:55:56,783 --> 01:55:59,661
in exchange for a small favor.

1513
01:56:00,621 --> 01:56:05,542
Rhodey and I are being honored
in Washington and we need a presenter.

1514
01:56:07,377 --> 01:56:08,879
I'll see what I can do.

1515
01:56:10,589 --> 01:56:15,427
<i>It is my honor to be here today
to present these distinguished awards</i>

1516
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:19,514
<i>to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes
and Mr. Tony Stark,</i>

1517
01:56:19,598 --> 01:56:22,935
<i>who is, of course, a national treasure.</i>

1518
01:56:25,103 --> 01:56:26,438
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel,

1519
01:56:26,521 --> 01:56:28,899
for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

1520
01:56:29,191 --> 01:56:31,193
- You deserve this.
- Thank you, sir.

1521
01:56:32,903 --> 01:56:34,196
Mr. Stark.

1522
01:56:34,279 --> 01:56:38,367
Thank you for such an exceptionally
distinguished performance.

1523
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:40,118
You deserve this.

1524
01:56:41,578 --> 01:56:44,039
Oh, sorry.

1525
01:56:44,122 --> 01:56:47,542
Funny how annoying
a little prick can be, isn't it?

1526
01:56:49,002 --> 01:56:50,796
Let's get a photo.

1527
02:04:16,950 --> 02:04:18,910
Sir, we've found it.
