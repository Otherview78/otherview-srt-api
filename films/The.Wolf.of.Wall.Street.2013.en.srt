00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,009
<i>The world of investing can be a jungle.</i>

2
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,261
<i>Bulls. Bears.</i>

3
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,222
<i>Danger at every turn.</i>

4
00:00:54,764 --> 00:01:00,353
<i>That's why we at Stratton Oakmont
pride ourselves on being the best.</i>

5
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:04,899
<i>Trained professionals to guide you

<i>Stability.</i>

<i>Integrity.</i>

9
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:12,615
<i>Pride.</i>

10
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,035
<i>One!</i>

11
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:17,828
Two!

12
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:19,497
Three!

13
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:28,506
Twenty-five grand to the first
cocksucker to nail a bull's-eye!

14
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,342
Come on! Let's go!

15
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,011
One!

16
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,513
Two!

17
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:37,723
Three!

18
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,351
<i>My name is Jordan Belfort.</i>

19
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,644
<i>Not him.</i>

20
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,437
<i>Me. That's right.</i>

21
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,398
<i>I'm a former member
of the middle class</i>

22
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:49,360
<i>raised by two accountants
in a tiny apartment in Bayside, Queens.</i>

23
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:53,114
<i>The year I turned 26,
as the head of my own brokerage firm,</i>

24
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:55,825
<i>I made $49 million,</i>

25
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:59,328
<i>which really pissed me off because
it was three shy of a million a week.</i>

26
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,626
<i>No, no, no. My Ferrari was white,</i>

27
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,879
<i>like Don Johnson's in</i> Miami Vice.
<i>Not red.</i>

28
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,428
<i>See that humongous estate down there?</i>

29
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:16,846
<i>That's my house.</i>

30
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,472
<i>For millionaires whose ships...</i>

31
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:22,810
<i>My wife, Naomi,
the Duchess of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn,</i>

32
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,021
<i>a former model and Miller Lite girl.</i>

33
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,148
<i>Yeah.</i>

34
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,775
<i>She was the one with my cock
in her mouth in the Ferrari.</i>

35
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:32,403
<i>So put your dick back in your pants.</i>

36
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,197
<i>In addition to Naomi
and my two perfect kids,</i>

37
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,158
<i>I own a mansion, private jet,</i>

38
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,868
<i>six cars, three horses,</i>

39
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:42,538
<i>two vacation homes,

40
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:45,458
<i>Anchors aweigh!</i>

41
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:52,214
<i>I also gamble like a degenerate.
I drink like a fish.</i>

42
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:55,092
<i>I fuck hookers maybe
five, six times a week.</i>

43
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:58,012
<i>I have three different federal agencies
looking to indict me.</i>

44
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:00,765
<i>Oh, yeah, and I love drugs.</i>

45
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,271
Okay.

46
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,523
- One more round.
- Oh, yeah.

47
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:11,442
- Oh, you like it?
- Yeah.

48
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,122
Pull up. Pull up!
We're gonna crash, for Christ sake!

49
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,457
Relax!

50
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:29,502
Just relax.

51
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,640
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

52
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,308
Good job.

53
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,977
You get in there safe, all right?

54
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,896
Till the next time, brother.

55
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,523
Till next time.

56
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:59,365
Yup, on a daily basis
I consume enough drugs

57
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:04,870
to sedate Manhattan,
Long Island and Queens for a month.

58
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:06,997
Okay, Mr. Jordan.

59
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:10,668
I take Quaaludes 10 to 15 times a day
for my "back pain,"

60
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,586
Adderall to stay focused,

61
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:15,589
Xanax to take the edge off,
pot to mellow me out,

62
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:18,634
cocaine to wake me back up again
and morphine, well,

63
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,177
because it's awesome.

64
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,387
Good morning, Nathan.

65
00:04:28,144 --> 00:04:30,646
But of all the drugs
under God's blue heaven,

66
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,773
there is one that is my absolute favorite.

67
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,359
You see,

68
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:38,821
enough of this shit'll
make you invincible.

69
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:41,615
Able to conquer the world,

70
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,826
and eviscerate your enemies.

71
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,956
And I'm not talking about this.

72
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,958
I'm talking about this.

73
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,839
<i>See, money doesn't
just buy you a better life,</i>

74
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,425
<i>better food, better cars, better pussy.</i>

75
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,802
<i>It also makes you a better person.</i>

76
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:05,473
<i>You can give generously to the church
or political party of your choice.</i>

77
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:08,684
<i>You can save the fucking
spotted owl with money.</i>

78
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:15,691
<i>I always wanted to be rich.
So let me go back.</i>

79
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,068
<i>I'm 22 years old, newly married,</i>

80
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,738
<i>and already a money-crazed little shit.</i>

81
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:21,989
<i>So what do I do?</i>

82
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,409
<i>I go to the one place on Earth
that befit my high-minded ambitions.</i>

83
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,079
I love you.

84
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:42,718
<i>You are lower than pond scum.</i>

85
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,763
You got a problem with that,

86
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:47,515
Jordan?

87
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,683
No. No problem at all.

88
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,477
Good. Because that is what you are.

89
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,937
Pond scum.

90
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,271
Your job is connector,

91
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:58,108
which means that you'll be dialing
the phone over 500 times a day

92
00:05:58,234 --> 00:06:01,111
trying to connect me
with wealthy business owners.

93
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:03,155
And until you pass your Series 7,

94
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:05,449
that is all you're gonna
fucking be doing. Sit.

95
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:06,784
Sit!

96
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:11,205
Now just so you know,
last year I made over $300,000.

97
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:14,875
The other guy you'll be working for,
he made over a million.

98
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,585
<i>A million dollars?</i>

99
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:19,630
<i>I could only imagine
what a douche bag that guy must be.</i>

100
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:22,633
- Jordan Belfort.
- Yes, sir.

101
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,385
- Mark Hanna.
- A pleasure to meet you.

102
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,054
And you as well. I see you've
already met the village asshole.

103
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,764
Smile and dial.

104
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,350
And don't pick up
your fucking head until 1 :00.

105
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:32,977
Hey, fuck him.

106
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,688
I'm the senior broker here.
He's just a worthless piker.

107
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:37,565
Why don't you blow me, Hanna?

108
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:40,985
Now did you really pitch
a stock in your job interview?

109
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,820
I had to do something
to stand out. Right, sir?

110
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:45,573
I fucking love that.

111
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,783
- Lunch. Today.
- Yeah.

112
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,703
We don't start dialing at 9:30

113
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,664
because our clients
are already answering the phone.

114
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,375
Three. Two. One.

115
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,459
Let's fuck!

116
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,130
<i>You want to know
what money sounds like?</i>

117
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,173
<i>Go to a trading floor on Wall Street.</i>

118
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,717
<i>"Fuck" this, "shit" that.</i>

119
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,343
<i>"Cunt, " "cock, " "asshole."</i>

120
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,512
<i>I couldn't believe
how these guys talked to each other.</i>

121
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:09,888
- Good fucking package...
- Piece of shit!

122
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,599
<i>I was hooked in seconds.</i>

123
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,852
<i>It was like mainlining adrenaline.</i>

124
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,229
Yeah. Fuckface, look at
where the stock's at today, huh?

125
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,190
You motherfucker,
you can't get any at 44...

126
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,568
- Pick up the cock sucking phone!
- Sorry...

127
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:27,489
You are such
a fucking douche bag, Hanna.

128
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:30,326
We don't give two shits
about how technology works

129
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:33,037
because all we care about
is getting fucking rich.

130
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:34,413
- Solid, 2,000.
- Jordan Belfort.

131
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:37,916
Done!

132
00:07:38,042 --> 00:07:39,627
Time to paint the tape.

133
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,964
2,000. Microsoft. Going in the hole!

134
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,341
Come on.

135
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,094
Live. Live. Hold on, that is hot.

136
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:53,098
In. In. Shut that motherfucker.
Shut it! Shut it! Shut it!

137
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,308
Sold!

138
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:13,744
Yeah.

139
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,002
Tootski?

140
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,505
Oh, no. Thank you, though.

141
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:27,174
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you
on this glorious afternoon?

142
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,968
Well, Hector, here's the game plan.

143
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:32,513
You're gonna bring us
two Absolut martinis.

144
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:34,139
You know how I like them. Straight up.

145
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:36,850
And then precisely seven
and one half minutes after that,

146
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,268
you're gonna bring us two more.

147
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:41,647
Then two more after that
every five minutes

148
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,941
until one of us passes the fuck out.

149
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,652
Excellent strategy, sir.

150
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,570
I'm good with water for now.

151
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:49,988
Thank you.

152
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,950
It's his first day on Wall Street.
Give him time.

153
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,744
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

154
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,788
Mr. Hanna?

155
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:04,169
You're able to do drugs during the day
and then still function, still do your job?

156
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,088
How the fuck else
would you do this job?

157
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,340
Cocaine and hookers, my friend.

158
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,842
Right.

159
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:15,639
Well, I got to say, I'm incredibly excited
to be a part of your firm. I mean...

160
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,599
The clients you have are absolutely...

161
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,143
Fuck the clients.

162
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:22,980
Your only responsibility
is to put meat on the table.

163
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,315
You got a girlfriend?

164
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,942
I'm married. I have a wife.

165
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,111
Her name is Teresa. She cuts hair.

166
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,487
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

167
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:31,905
Think about Teresa.

168
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,157
Name of the game.

169
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:37,077
Move the money from
your client's pocket into your pocket.

170
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,245
Right.

171
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,997
But if you make your clients
money at the same time,

172
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,332
it's advantageous to everyone. Correct?

173
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,168
No.

174
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:47,171
Number one rule of Wall Street.

175
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:49,339
Nobody...

176
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:51,592
I don't care if you're Warren Buffett
or if you're Jimmy Buffett.

177
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:56,305
Nobody knows if a stock is gonna go up,
down, sideways, or in fucking circles.

178
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,390
Least of all stockbrokers, right?

179
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:01,059
It's all a fugazi.
You know what a fugazi is?

180
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:03,520
Fugayzi. It's a fake.

181
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,023
Fugayzi, fugazi,
it's a whazy, it's a woozy, it's...

182
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,442
Fairy dust. It doesn't exist.

183
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,945
It's never landed. It is no matter.
It's not on the elemental chart.

184
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,031
It's not fucking real.

185
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,949
- Right?
- Right.

186
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,743
Stay with me.

187
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,120
We don't create shit.
We don't build anything.

188
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,371
No.

189
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:24,291
So if you got a client
who bought stock at eight

190
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,794
and it now sits at 16,
he's all fucking happy.

191
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,963
He wants to cash in, liquidate,
take his fucking money and run home.

192
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,007
- You don't let him do that.
- Okay.

193
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,967
- 'Cause that would make it real.
- Right.

194
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,302
No. What do you do?

195
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,346
You get another brilliant idea.

196
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,889
A special idea.

197
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:43,560
Another "situation." Another stock
to reinvest his earnings and then some.

198
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,896
And he will, every single time.

199
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,065
'Cause they're fucking addicted.

200
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:51,235
And you just keep doing this,
again and again and again.

201
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,987
Meanwhile, he thinks
he's getting shit rich,

202
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:56,156
which he is, on paper.

203
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,908
But you and me, the brokers,

204
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:02,120
we're taking home cold hard cash
via commission, motherfucker.

205
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:03,914
Right.

206
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,585
That's incredible, sir.
I can't tell you how excited I am.

207
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,128
You should be.

208
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:13,966
There's two keys to success
in the broker business.

209
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,634
First of all...

210
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,680
- You gotta stay relaxed.
- Yeah.

211
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:20,889
Do you jerk off?

212
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,017
Do I... Do I jerk off?

213
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,311
Yeah. Yeah, I jerk off. Yeah.

214
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:27,688
How many times a week?

215
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,357
Like three or four.

216
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,734
- Three or four times, maybe five.
- Gotta pump those numbers up.

217
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:35,320
Those are rookie numbers
in this racket.

218
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:39,074
I myself, I jerk off at least twice a day.

219
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,868
- Wow.
- Once in the morning

220
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,412
right after I work out,
then once right after lunch.

221
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,872
Really?

222
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,875
I want to. That's not why I do it.

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,085
I do it 'cause I fucking need to.

224
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,671
Think about it.
You're dealing with numbers.

225
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,716
All day long, decimal points,
high frequencies.

226
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,842
Bang, bang, bang.

227
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,136
Fucking digits.

228
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,639
All very acidic
above-the-shoulders mustard shit.

229
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:03,974
All right?

230
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:06,560
It kind of wigs some people out. Right.

231
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,770
You got to feed the geese
to keep the blood flowing.

232
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,522
I keep the rhythm below the belt.

233
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:11,857
Done.

234
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,609
This is not a tip, this is a prescription.

235
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:14,860
Trust me.

236
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:17,446
If you don't, you will fall out of balance,

237
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,656
split your differential
and tip the fuck over.

238
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,033
Or worse yet,

239
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:23,327
I've seen this happen, implode.

240
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,870
No, I don't want to implode, sir.

241
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,121
No. No, you don't.

242
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,456
I'm in it for the long run, you know?

243
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,124
- Implosions are ugly.
- Yeah.

244
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,376
Pop off to the bathroom,
work one out any time you can.

245
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,461
When you get really good at it,

246
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,672
you'll fucking be stroking it
and you'll be thinking about money.

247
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,844
Second key to success in this racket

248
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,179
is this little baby right here.

249
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,639
It's called cocaine.

250
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,015
Right.

251
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,936
It'll keep you sharp between the ears.
It'll also help your fingers dial faster.

252
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,395
And guess what?

253
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,022
That's good for me.

254
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,024
Yes, sir.

255
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,276
Revolutions. You follow?

256
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,444
Revolutions.

257
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,780
Keep the clients on the Ferris wheel.

258
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:03,408
And it goes. The park is open 24/7, 365,

259
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:06,411
every decade, every goddamn century.

260
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,913
That's it.

261
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,706
The name of the game.

262
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,292
Halkidiki?

263
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,502
Thank you.

264
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:26,932
Come on.

265
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:34,064
We're the common denominator.

266
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,157
Keep it up for me.

267
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,159
<i>You've seen the echo</i>

268
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:47,786
<i>And the money comes in</i>

269
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,288
<i>The parade comes to town</i>

270
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,165
<i>Going down Broadway</i>

271
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:53,834
<i>It's a one-way street</i>

272
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,168
<i>Whichever way I go</i>

273
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,465
<i>The next six months,</i>

274
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,884
<i>I got to know the ins
and outs of Wall Street.</i>

275
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:06,596
<i>Earning shit money as I geared up
to take my Series 7.</i>

276
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:13,812
Oh, fuckers.

277
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:24,698
<i>Then I was a licensed broke rat last,</i>

278
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,742
<i>ready to make my fortune.</i>

279
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:31,413
<i>My first day as a future
Master of the Universe.</i>

280
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:41,006
I have Exxon at 1/4 six months ago.

281
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,467
Today it is trading at 36 1/2.

282
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,718
Mr...

283
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,099
<i>They called it Black Monday.</i>

284
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:52,392
<i>No shit.</i>

285
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:56,563
<i>By 4:</i><i>00 p.m., the market
had dropped 508 points.</i>

286
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,483
<i>The biggest plummet
since the crash of '29.</i>

287
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,942
I know your family, you know mine.

288
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:04,029
No, I don't know. Some fucking
country in Europe took a shit.

289
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,447
Let them do
what they want to fucking do.

290
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,782
Our market's solid.

291
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:08,492
This is not something
that you want to sell.

292
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,160
You know what happened?
A fucking tsunami.

293
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,536
I think you're making a big mistake.

294
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,038
Yes, I will talk to your wife.

295
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,206
Trust me, do not answer the phone.

296
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,250
A lot of people are gonna be calling you,
trying to get your dirty laundry.

297
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:18,627
We don't know what's going on here.

298
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,961
I know. I know.

299
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,389
Holy

300
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:35,310
fucking shit!

301
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,730
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

302
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:41,274
<i>My first shitty day as a broker.</i>

303
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,777
<i>Within a month, L.F. Rothschild,</i>

304
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,573
<i>an institution since 1899,
closed its doors.</i>

305
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,076
<i>Wall Street had swallowed me up</i>

306
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,537
<i>and shit me right back out again.</i>

307
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,209
We could pawn my engagement ring
if we needed to.

308
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,794
- Babe...
- Because I don't mind.

309
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:01,962
If we needed to, I'm saying...

310
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,588
- Will you listen to me?
- Okay.

311
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,799
You're not pawning anything. Okay?

312
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,259
- Okay.
- What do I always tell you?

313
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,468
You're gonna be a millionaire.

314
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:11,054
That's right. Okay? Just let me look.

315
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,222
We'll find something.

316
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,974
- How about this?
- What?

317
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,518
Nobody Beats the Wiz,
the electronics store.

318
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,061
Stock boy. What do you think?

319
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,396
You're not gonna work at that place.

320
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:20,522
Yeah, but, you know, you start off...

321
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,690
Jordan, you're gonna be
miserable at that place

322
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:22,816
- if you go there.
- I know.

323
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,110
It's sales. You work your way up,
you'll be a general manager.

324
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,987
- You're not gonna be a stock boy.
- Why not?

325
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,738
'Cause you're a stockbroker.

326
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:31,199
You understand that
nobody's hiring stockbrokers right now?

327
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:32,742
You understand that?

328
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:34,286
Okay?

329
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,042
This place is.

330
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,836
- What?
- What's that say?

331
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,129
"Stockbrokers."

332
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:46,882
In Long Island?

333
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,550
- Stockbrokers in Long Island?
- Yeah.

334
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,343
<i>It's in Long Island. So what?</i>

335
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,199
Hey, I'm looking for Investor's Center.

336
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,118
What's that? You want to invest?

337
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,288
No. Investor's Center.
I'm looking for Investor's Center.

338
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:22,042
Yeah, yeah, that's us. Hey.
This is it. This is it.

339
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:23,668
- I'm Dwayne. Yeah.
- You're Dwayne?

340
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,754
Hi, Dwayne. We spoke on the phone.

341
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,297
I'm Jordan Belfort.

342
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,633
I'm the broker from
Rothschild in New York.

343
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,801
Yes, yeah. Have a seat. How are you?

344
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,011
We had a conversation...

345
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,346
We spoke on the phone earlier, right?

346
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,764
- Two hours ago.
- Right.

347
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:36,848
Yeah.

348
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:40,977
They're up and comers.
That's what that means.

349
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,896
It's three cents a share, that's $3!

350
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,439
You cheap fuck!

351
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,399
So...

352
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:49,444
So where are your Quotrons here?

353
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,404
- Quotrons?
- Yeah. Your computers.

354
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:52,781
No, no. We don't even
need computers here.

355
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,574
We just trade right off
the pink sheets here.

356
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,493
- Pink sheets?
- Yeah, they're penny stocks.

357
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,411
You know, companies that
can't get listed on NASDAQ,

358
00:17:58,495 --> 00:17:59,663
they don't have enough capital?

359
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,872
Their shares trade here.

360
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:02,666
- Penny stocks?
- Yeah.

361
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,627
This one, Aerodyne,
is a really interesting...

362
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,087
Or Aerotyne...

363
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,630
Aerotyne, yeah.

364
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,340
Aero... Aerotyne...

365
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:11,800
Aerotyne. Yeah.

366
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,009
Very hot stock right now.

367
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,094
Oh, yeah?

368
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:15,428
They're just a couple
of brothers that are making

369
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,805
radar detectors out of their garage.

370
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:17,931
They're out in Dubuque.

371
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,266
Maybe it's microwaves. I'm not sure.

372
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:20,767
But you call the company's main line,

373
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,644
their mom, Dorothy, answers
and she is so sweet.

374
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,646
- Good company.
- I actually don't know what else to...

375
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,315
I don't know anything else
about them other than that.

376
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:28,942
Six cents a share?

377
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,987
Hey, come on. Who buys this crap?

378
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,196
Well, I mean...

379
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:34,614
Honestly, mostly schmucks.

380
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,700
Postmen, there's always postmen.

381
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,702
Plumbers.

382
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,830
They see our ads in the back
of <i>Hustler</i> and <i>Popular Mechanics.</i>

383
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,749
Our ads actually say
they can get rich quick.

384
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,042
- <i>Hustler?</i>
- Yeah.

385
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,335
You know, those girlie magazines.

386
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:48,878
Yeah, yeah. Nudie mag.

387
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,088
- A lot.
- Yeah.

388
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,798
We're helping them finance houses,

389
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,800
we're helping them
buy their wife a diamond ring...

390
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:54,926
A boat maybe.

391
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,887
Is this... Is this stuff regulated
or are you guys...

392
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,055
What are you doing here?

393
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,934
Sort of.

394
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,227
Sort of?

395
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,481
Jesus Christ,
the spread on these is huge.

396
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:09,816
Yeah. And that's the point, that's...

397
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:10,984
What's your name again?

398
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,402
Mine... Jordan Belfort.

399
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,321
Jordan, what do you get
on that blue chip stock?

400
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:17,407
I make one percent.
Or I did make one percent.

401
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,326
Pink sheets, it's 50.

402
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,580
It's 50%?

403
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:25,790
50% commission?

404
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,584
- Yup.
- For what?

405
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,794
It's our markup for our services.

406
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:32,589
And so if I... If I...

407
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,718
If I sell a stock at $10,000,
my commission is 5,000 bucks?

408
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,346
If you sell $10,000 worth of this stock,

409
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,015
I will personally give you
a blow job for free.

410
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,477
And I hope it happens.

411
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,105
<i>Hello, John, how are you doing today?</i>

412
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,816
You mailed in my company
a postcard a few weeks back

413
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,737
requesting information on penny stocks
that had huge upside potential

414
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,489
with very little downside risk.

415
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,491
- Does that ring a bell?
- <i>Yeah, I may have sent something.</i>

416
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:02,702
Okay, great.
The reason for the call today, John, is,

417
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,455
something just came
across my desk, John.

418
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,541
It is perhaps the best thing
I've seen in the last six months.

419
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,544
If you have 60 seconds, I'd like to share
the idea with you. You got a minute?

420
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,629
<i>Actually, I'm really very...</i>

421
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,173
The name of the company,
Aerotyne International.

422
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,510
It is a cutting edge
high-tech firm out of the Midwest

423
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,512
<i>awaiting imminent patent approval</i>

424
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:23,139
on the next generation
of radar detectors

425
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:27,644
that have both huge military
and civilian applications now.

426
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,020
Right now, John,

427
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,564
the stock trades over-the-counter
at 10 cents a share.

428
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,025
And by the way, John,
our analysts indicate

429
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:36,403
it could go a heck
of a lot higher than that.

430
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:42,450
Your profit on a mere $6,000 investment
would be upwards of $60,000!

431
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,077
<i>Jesus! That's my mortgage, man.</i>

432
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,745
Exactly. You could
pay off your mortgage.

433
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:47,330
<i>This stock will pay off my house?</i>

434
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:50,500
John, one thing I can promise you,
even in this market,

435
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:54,087
is that I never ask my clients
to judge me on my winners.

436
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:57,757
I ask them to judge me on my losers
because I have so few.

437
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,426
And in the case of Aerotyne,

438
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:02,137
based on every technical factor
out there, John,

439
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,348
we are looking at
a grand slam home run.

440
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,309
<i>Okay, let's do it. I'll do four grand.</i>

441
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:10,603
$4,000? That'd be 40,000 shares, John.

442
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,147
Let me lock in that trade right now

443
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,523
and get back to you with my secretary

444
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,525
with an exact confirmation.
Sound good, John?

445
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,860
- <i>Yeah, sounds good.</i>
- Great.

446
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,111
Hey, John.

447
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,238
Thank you for your vote of confidence.

448
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,739
And welcome to the Investor's Center.

449
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:22,949
<i>Yeah, thanks a lot, man.</i>

450
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,325
Bye-bye.

451
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,372
How'd you fucking do that?

452
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,127
<i>Just like that, I made two grand.</i>

453
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,963
<i>The other guys looked at me
like I'd just discovered fire.</i>

454
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:39,799
Great! Even better!

455
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:43,553
<i>I was selling garbage to garbage men
and making cash hand over fist.</i>

456
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,181
The only problem you're gonna have
is that you didn't buy more.

457
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:49,893
<i>So I was selling them shit.</i>

458
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,730
<i>But the way I looked at it,
their money was better off in my pocket.</i>

459
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,648
<i>I knew how to spend it better.</i>

460
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,401
<i>Excuse me. Is that your car in the lot?</i>

461
00:21:58,735 --> 00:21:59,903
<i>Yeah.</i>

462
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:01,946
<i>-It's a nice ride.
- Thanks, man.</i>

463
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,239
Donnie Azoff.

464
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,365
Hey. I'm Jordan Belfort.

465
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:05,742
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

466
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,660
You know, actually,
I see that car around.

467
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:09,412
- I see it around a lot.
- Oh, yeah, where?

468
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,289
I think we live in the same building.

469
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,457
- No shit?
- Yeah, yeah.

470
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,250
- Twelfth floor?
- Yeah. What floor are you on?

471
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,460
Fourth floor.

472
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,378
- I have two little kids. Ugly wife.
- Right.

473
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,423
What do you do, bro?

474
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:23,384
What do you mean, what do I do?

475
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,677
For work, what do you do?

476
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:25,929
I'm a stockbroker.

477
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,764
- Stockbroker?
- Yeah.

478
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,432
Children's furniture.

479
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:30,808
Oh, good for you.

480
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:32,268
It's all right.

481
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,811
You make a lot of money?

482
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,940
Yeah, I do all right for myself.

483
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,274
I'm trying to put it together.

484
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:41,319
You got your fucking nice car,
we live in the same building. I just...

485
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,988
I'm not understanding...
How much money do you make?

486
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,867
I don't know. $70,000 last month.

487
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,744
Get the fuck...

488
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,621
Get the fuck out of here.

489
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,956
No, I'm serious.

490
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:54,290
Yeah, no, I'm serious, too.

491
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,417
Seriously, how much money
do you make?

492
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,795
I told you. $70,000.

493
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,422
Well, technically, $72,000.

494
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:03,466
Last month. Something like that.

495
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,553
You made 72 grand in one month?

496
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:07,804
Yeah.

497
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,476
I'll tell you what.

498
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,729
You show me a pay stub
for $72,000 on it,

499
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:19,148
I quit my job right now
and I work for you.

500
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,490
<i>Hey, Paulie, what's up?</i>

501
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:29,909
No, yeah, yeah. No, everything's fine.

502
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,411
Hey, listen, I quit.

503
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,371
<i>And he did quit his job.</i>

504
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:36,416
<i>Which I thought was a little weird.
I mean, I just met this fucking guy.</i>

505
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,376
Don't fucking tell Susan.
It's none of her business.

506
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:39,794
<i>There were other things about him, too.</i>

507
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,005
<i>Like his phosphorescent white teeth.</i>

508
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,256
...wife! I gotta fucking
deal with your wife?

509
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,508
<i>The fact that he wore
horn rims with clear lenses</i>

510
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,552
<i>just to look more WASP-y.</i>

511
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,513
<i>And then, there were these rumors.</i>

512
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,224
I heard some stupid shit. I don't know.

513
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:55,768
Fuck, I didn't even want
to bring it up. It's just...

514
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:57,645
- It's stupid.
- Shit with me?

515
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,897
You know, people say shit.
I don't even know.

516
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:02,400
I don't even listen to it half the time.

517
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,068
What are they saying?

518
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:07,614
Shit about you and your cousin
or something like that.

519
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:08,906
I don't even listen to it.

520
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,534
Bro, it's not like that.

521
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,077
It's not like that.

522
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:15,872
Like you married your cousin
or some stupid shit. No?

523
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:17,957
Yeah, my wife. Yeah.

524
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,792
My wife is my cousin, or whatever.

525
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:22,503
But it's not like what you think,
or whatever, you know.

526
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:24,547
Is she like a first cousin, or is she...

527
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:25,882
Yeah, no, she's, you know...

528
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,925
Her... Her father

529
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,678
is the brother of my mom.

530
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:32,388
It's not like, what... You know.

531
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,015
Look, we grew up together.

532
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,476
And she grew up hot, you know.
She fucking grew up hot.

533
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,311
And all my friends were
trying to fuck her, you know.

534
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,271
And I'm not gonna let someone...

535
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,939
You know, one of these assholes
fuck my cousin,

536
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:45,485
so, you know, I used the cousin thing
as like an in with her.

537
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,071
I'm not gonna let
someone else fuck my cousin.

538
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,822
You know, if anyone's
gonna fuck my cousin,

539
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,783
it's gonna be me,
out of respect. You know?

540
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:52,992
No, I get it. Yeah.

541
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:55,244
I mean, you're not afraid of like
the whole kid thing, right?

542
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,537
- What? Having kids with her?
- Yeah.

543
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:57,830
No. We have two kids.

544
00:24:58,081 --> 00:24:59,374
And they're... I mean...

545
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:02,043
I don't want to get personal,
but they're okay?

546
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,253
No, they're not retarded
or anything like that.

547
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,255
But there's a big chance, right, if...

548
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,675
Yeah, there's like a 60%, you know,

549
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:12,261
60 to 65% chance the kid's
gonna be fucking retarded or whatever.

550
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,429
That'd scare the shit out of me, buddy.

551
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,848
Look, man, a lot of having a kid,
or whatever, takes risk,

552
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:17,684
whether you're fucking cousins or not.

553
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,520
What if something like that happened?

554
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:22,188
Basically, you know,
if the kid was retarded,

555
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:25,566
I would, you know,
drive it up to the country

556
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,318
and just, like, you know,
open the door and say,

557
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,612
"You're free now."
You know, like, "Run free."

558
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:31,197
You know?

559
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,954
You're completely fucking with me.

560
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:41,958
That's horrible. You're not gonna...

561
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,626
You look like you've... No.

562
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,545
We would take it to, like,
an institution or somewhere

563
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:48,423
that's handled to, like, you know,
raise the kid or whatever.

564
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,050
You know what? If you're happy,
God bless you, buddy.

565
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:54,470
No, I'm not fucking happy.
No one who's married is fucking happy.

566
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,305
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, buddy.

567
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,391
Listen, I'm really, you know...

568
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,810
I'm really appreciative
for this fucking job.

569
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:02,061
I'm really enjoying it.

570
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:03,563
I'm really happy with what you're doing.

571
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,940
Actually, I got you a little present.

572
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,442
- You got me a present?
- I got you something.

573
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:08,818
Oh, fuck. You're sweet.

574
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:10,153
Yeah. It's in the back though.

575
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,613
- What do you mean?
- You gotta go out back.

576
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:14,991
Like it's wrapped up or something?

577
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:16,576
It's wrapped up. Yeah.

578
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:17,785
- I don't get it.
- Neither do I.

579
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:19,328
Let's fucking go. Come on.

580
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,581
Your turn.

581
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,750
I'm not fucking doing this.
You're out of your fucking mind.

582
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,793
- Smoke this shit, bro.
- No.

583
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:27,879
No one's fucking here, bro.

584
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,005
Get the fuck...

585
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,882
Fucking smoke crack with me, bro.

586
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,091
I'm not fucking doing it.

587
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,886
Smoke crack. Smoke some
fucking crack with me, bro.

588
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:37,346
- One hit. One hit. That's it.
- Okay.

589
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,348
Fucking nut job.

590
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,080
Wow!

591
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:06,876
Wow.

592
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:11,881
Let's go run, huh?

593
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,091
We gotta get out of here, buddy.

594
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:16,969
We gotta get out of here.
Let's go fucking run.

595
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:20,473
Let's run like we're fucking lions
and tigers and bears!

596
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:23,059
Let's run! Let's fucking run!

597
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:25,144
Let's fucking run! Go!

598
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,604
Go, go, go, go!

599
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:30,066
<i>You've reached Frank's Best Auto Body.</i>

600
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,651
<i>We're closed right now.</i>

601
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,736
<i>So please leave us a message.</i>

602
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,488
<i>Hello. My name is Jordan Belfort.</i>

603
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:38,991
<i>My partner and I are very interested
in renting out your garage.</i>

604
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,536
<i>Donnie and I were
going out on our own.</i>

605
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:43,955
<i>And the first thing
we needed was brokers.</i>

606
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:45,957
<i>Guys with sales experience.</i>

607
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,959
<i>So I recruited
some of my hometown boys.</i>

608
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:51,212
<i>Sea Otter, who sold meat and weed.</i>

609
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:54,674
<i>Chester, who sold tires and weed.</i>

610
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:57,593
<i>And Robbie, who sold anything
he could get his hands on.</i>

611
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:58,970
<i>Mostly weed.</i>

612
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,597
Can you bring me some ketchup? Okay?

613
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:03,099
<i>This is Brad.</i>

614
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,851
<i>And Brad's the guy I really wanted.</i>

615
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,185
<i>But he didn't go along with us.</i>

616
00:28:06,269 --> 00:28:08,813
<i>He was already making
so much money selling Quaaludes,</i>

617
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,649
<i>he'd become the Quaalude king
of Bay side.</i>

618
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:12,817
Getting any pussy
with that thing or what?

619
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,860
Yeah, man, of course.

620
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:15,862
Bring some of them chicks
around here sometime, huh?

621
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:17,196
Let 'em watch.

622
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,115
Let 'em watch. Know what I mean?

623
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:23,202
Hey, Zip! You tell your sister
I was asking about her.

624
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,455
Why don't you bring me a pair of
her panties next time you come through.

625
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,375
Yeah, man. She said she don't want
to talk to you anymore, man.

626
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,668
Get the fuck out of here.

627
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:33,963
Hey, Ma, we got chicken or what?

628
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,007
Ma!

629
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,676
You listening? It's easier than you think.

630
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,219
Every person you're on the phone with,

631
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:42,805
they want to get rich
and they want to get rich quickly.

632
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:44,056
They all want something for nothing.

633
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,601
There was this one time that
I was selling pot to this Amish dude.

634
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,060
You know those guys
who got like the beard

635
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:50,187
with like no mustache or some bullshit?

636
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:54,150
Well, he says that he only
wants to make furniture.

637
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:55,735
I don't understand.

638
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:56,986
What's that got to do with anything?

639
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:58,946
What the fuck are you talking about?

640
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,907
I'm not putting words
in your mouth or nothing,

641
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,160
but you just said that
everybody wants to get rich.

642
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:06,662
Holy fuck, you did just say that.

643
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,081
What the fuck are you talking about?

644
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,250
Yeah, like Buddhists.
They don't give a shit about money.

645
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:13,336
They're wrapped in sheets.
They're not buying shit.

646
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,171
I'm not talking about
Buddhists or Amish.

647
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,007
I'm talking about normal people,
working-class, everyday people.

648
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,009
Everyone wants to get rich. Am I crazy?

649
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,385
There's no such thing
as an Amish Buddhist.

650
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:23,346
- I'm pretty fucking sure.
- There could be.

651
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,681
Can we get some ketchup, please?

652
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,141
Do you guys not want to make money?

653
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,976
I want to make some money.

654
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,353
I want to make
some fucking money, okay.

655
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:31,771
I can sell anything.

656
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:33,773
Shit, I can sell ludes
to a convent full of nuns,

657
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:35,775
and get them so horny
they'd be fucking each other.

658
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,693
That's the attitude.
You can sell anything?

659
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:39,362
Sell me this fucking pen right here.

660
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,113
You can sell anything.
Sell that. Go ahead.

661
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:42,365
Sell me the pen.

662
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:45,159
Can I finish eating first?
I haven't eaten today.

663
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,620
Brad, show them how it's done. Boom.

664
00:29:47,745 --> 00:29:49,205
Sell me that pen. Watch. Go on.

665
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:50,831
You want me to sell this fucking pen?

666
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:53,417
That's my boy right there.
Can fucking sell anything.

667
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:54,502
Why don't you do me a favor.

668
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,253
Write your name down
on that napkin for me.

669
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:57,380
I don't have a pen.

670
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,173
Exactly. Supply and demand, my friend.

671
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:00,341
- Holy shit.
- See what I'm saying?

672
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:01,801
He's creating urgency.

673
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:03,344
Get them to want to buy the stock.

674
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:05,304
Convince them it's something
they need, you know what I mean?

675
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:06,555
And that's the thing.

676
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,140
All nuns are lesbians.

677
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:10,142
What the fuck
are you talking about, Otter?

678
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:13,020
Think about it. They can't keep a dude
so they're gonna start fucking chicks.

679
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:15,231
Four fucking times, Kimmie! Four times.

680
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:16,774
- He's not with us.
- Friggin' Rambo.

681
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,192
Now she runs.

682
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:21,153
<i>But look. I knew these guys
weren't like Harvard MBAs.</i>

683
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:25,157
<i>Robbie Feinberg, the pinhead,
took five years to finish high school.</i>

684
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:28,160
<i>Alden Kupferberg, the Sea Otter,
didn't even graduate.</i>

685
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:32,498
<i>Chester Ming, the depraved Chinaman,
thought jujitsu was in Israel.</i>

686
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:35,042
<i>Smartest of the bunch
was Nicky Koskoff</i>

687
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:36,794
<i>He actually went to law school.</i>

688
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:40,297
<i>I called him Rugrat
because of his piece of shit hairpiece.</i>

689
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,218
<i>Still, give them to me
young, hungry and stupid</i>

690
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:47,346
<i>and in no time, I'll make them rich.</i>

691
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:50,599
Oh, my God.

692
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,143
Jordan, that...

693
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:53,561
You like it, baby?

694
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:55,396
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

695
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:57,898
They're not the biggest stones
in the world,

696
00:30:57,982 --> 00:30:59,734
but I promise they're really high quality.

697
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:01,193
It's beautiful.

698
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:03,195
They're so beautiful.

699
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:04,780
Oh, boy.

700
00:31:05,281 --> 00:31:06,282
What?

701
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,868
I know that look. What is it? Go ahead.

702
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:10,619
I don't know, it's... You know...

703
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,497
These stocks... These companies...

704
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,624
They're like crappy companies.

705
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,001
- Well, yeah.
- Okay.

706
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,461
Yeah, they're terrible.

707
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,006
Don't worry about it. I told you,
what I'm doing is completely legal.

708
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,174
Yeah, I know.

709
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:25,384
But they're not gonna make
anyone money though, right?

710
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,262
Well, sometimes they do,
sometimes they don't.

711
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:29,764
You know how it goes.

712
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:32,391
Wouldn't you feel better
if you sold that stuff to rich people

713
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:35,436
who can, like, afford
to lose all that money?

714
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:37,646
Of course.

715
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,858
But rich people don't buy penny stocks.

716
00:31:41,484 --> 00:31:42,818
They just don't.

717
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:44,487
Why not?

718
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:49,658
<i>Because they're too smart,
that's why not.</i>

719
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:52,745
<i>I mean, what person
with a college education</i>

720
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:54,121
<i>would trust this bunch of jerk-offs?</i>

721
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:55,414
Hang up the phone.
Tell him you'll call him back.

722
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:56,582
I got five fucking grand
on the phone right now!

723
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,708
Hey!

724
00:31:57,792 --> 00:32:00,753
<i>But what if they didn't sound
like a bunch of jerk-offs?</i>

725
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:04,090
<i>What if I could teach them
how to sell to people with money?</i>

726
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:05,674
<i>Real money.</i>

727
00:32:06,342 --> 00:32:07,927
<i>So I decided to reinvent the company.</i>

728
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:10,638
Gentlemen, welcome

729
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,516
to Stratton Oakmont.

730
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:18,687
You schnooks will now be targeting
the wealthiest 1% of Americans.

731
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,815
We're talking about whales here.

732
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:22,775
Moby fucking Dicks.

733
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:27,071
And with this script,
which is now your new harpoon,

734
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,240
I'm gonna teach
each and every one of you

735
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:31,992
to be Captain fucking Ahab.

736
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,702
Get it? Huh?

737
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,162
Captain who?

738
00:32:35,246 --> 00:32:36,664
Captain Ahab. From the fucking...

739
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,334
The book, motherfucker. From the book.

740
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,419
Turn your fucking brain on.

741
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:44,004
- Fuck you.
- Jesus fuck, Robbie.

742
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:46,924
Listen to me.
We're a new company with a new name.

743
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:50,177
A company that
our clients can believe in.

744
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:53,180
A company that our clients can trust.

745
00:32:53,264 --> 00:32:57,810
A firm whose roots are
so deeply embedded into Wall Street

746
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:01,313
that our very founders
sailed over on the <i>Mayflower</i>

747
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:03,232
and chiseled the name
Stratton Oakmont

748
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,609
right into Plymouth fucking Rock!

749
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,986
You got it?

750
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:09,238
What we're gonna do is this.

751
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:14,493
First we pitch 'em Disney, AT&T, IBM,
blue chip stocks exclusively.

752
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:16,745
Companies these people know.

753
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:20,875
Once we've suckered them in,
we unload the dog shit.

754
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,670
The pink sheets, the penny stocks,
where we make the money.

755
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,922
50% commission, baby.

756
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:30,009
Now the key to making money
in a situation like this

757
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:33,095
is to position yourself now
before the settlement.

758
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:36,098
Because by the time you read about it
in <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i>

759
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:38,058
it's already too late.

760
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,269
Then you wait.

761
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,437
You wait.

762
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,106
And whoever speaks first loses.

763
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,359
<i>Sorry...</i>

764
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,944
<i>I appreciate the call.</i>

765
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:53,240
<i>I really have to give this some thought
and talk to my wife about it.</i>

766
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:54,658
<i>Can I call you back?</i>

767
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:56,035
They don't know, right?
They gotta think about it,

768
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:58,495
they gotta talk to their fucking wives,
or the fucking Tooth Fairy.

769
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,372
Point is, it doesn't matter
what the fuck they say.

770
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:03,959
The only real objection that they have
is that they don't trust you guys.

771
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:05,669
And why should they trust you?
I mean, look at you.

772
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,504
You're a bunch of fucking
sleazy salesmen, right?

773
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,299
So, what do you say?

774
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,552
You mean to tell me that if I put you in
at Union Carbide at seven

775
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:15,054
and took you out at 32...

776
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,723
Texas Instruments at 11
and took you out at 47...

777
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,267
U.S. Steel at 16, took you out at 41 ...

778
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:22,019
You wouldn't be saying
to me right now, "Chester,

779
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,896
"pick me up
a few thousand shares of Disney

780
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,106
"on the spot, right now. Come on."

781
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,524
Honestly, Kevin? Honestly? Seriously?

782
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:28,943
<i>I don't know you.</i>

783
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:31,320
<i>You cold-called me.
You're a total stranger.</i>

784
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:34,240
I am in complete agreement with you.
You don't know me, I don't know you.

785
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,951
Let me introduce myself to you.
My name is Alden Kupferberg.

786
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,369
- Robbie Feinberg.
- Chester Ming.

787
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:40,287
I'm Senior Vice President
at Stratton Oakmont...

788
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:41,789
...and I plan on being one of the...

789
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:44,166
...top brokers in my firm next year.

790
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,168
And I'm not gonna get there
by being wrong, Stanley.

791
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:48,254
<i>I do wanna say that you sound like a...</i>

792
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:50,089
<i>You sound like a pretty sincere guy.</i>

793
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:52,424
<i>It's not gonna make you rich
and it's not gonna make you poor.</i>

794
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:54,969
But what this trade will do is serve as...

795
00:34:55,052 --> 00:34:57,304
...a benchmark for
future business, Kevin.

796
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,223
You feel comfortable
with me now, Scotty?

797
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:00,599
And then you'll know for sure

798
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:02,726
that you finally found
a broker on Wall Street

799
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,353
that you can trust,

800
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:08,023
and who can consistently
make you money.

801
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,525
Sound fair enough?

802
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:13,529
<i>You know what... Yeah.</i>

803
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:16,490
<i>I gotta say, I'm pretty impressed.</i>

804
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,326
<i>What are you thinking?</i>

805
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,494
Kevin.

806
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:22,955
You give me one shot here

807
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:25,666
on a blue chip stock like Kodak,

808
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,960
and believe me, Kevin,

809
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,546
the only problem you're gonna have

810
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,048
is that you didn't buy more.

811
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,717
Sound fair enough?

812
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:37,261
<i>Shit. My...</i>

813
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,808
<i>My wife might divorce me, but...</i>

814
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,059
<i>Yeah, let's do it.</i>

815
00:35:45,728 --> 00:35:47,146
Excellent choice, Kevin.

816
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:49,064
How much do you
want to go for this time?

817
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:51,108
<i>Let's do five... $5,000.</i>

818
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:52,359
Can we try 8,000, Kevin?

819
00:35:52,443 --> 00:35:53,777
<i>All right. Let's do 10.</i>

820
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,154
- Ten.
- <i>You want to do that?</i>

821
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:56,238
Excellent choice!

822
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:59,116
Kevin, let me lock in that trade right now
and get back to you in a few minutes

823
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,492
with an exact confirmation, Kevin.

824
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:03,162
And welcome to Stratton Oakmont.

825
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:05,414
<i>Thanks, man. I'm gonna have a beer.</i>

826
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:06,623
<i>This is fun.</i>

827
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:07,916
Take it easy, Kev.

828
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,918
<i>Hey, thanks, Jordan. Thanks a...</i>

829
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,588
Fuck that motherfucker!

830
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,548
That's what I'm talking about!

831
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,303
What a fucking idiot.

832
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:22,848
The one thing I know about
in this world is airlines.

833
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:26,310
And Cuchon Airlines
is the future of airlines.

834
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:27,519
Get in now or...

835
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:29,355
- I'm Nicky Koskoff...
- Chester Ming...

836
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,940
...and I'm a Senior Vice President
with Stratton Oakmont.

837
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:36,153
Judy, I am so, so, so sorry for your loss.

838
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:37,696
When did he pass?

839
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,781
Just say I'm wrong, right.

840
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:39,907
And the stock goes down
a couple points...

841
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,492
...and it makes you,
in the words of my grandfather,

842
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:44,370
God rest his soul, "A shit ton of money."

843
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:45,579
It's like getting in on fucking sunlight

844
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:47,289
before there was fucking sunlight.
You understand?

845
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:49,124
<i>Can we do 8,000 shares?</i>

846
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,667
<i>Okay, 25,000.</i>

847
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:53,796
That's a very intelligent decision.

848
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,506
I'm gonna transfer you
to my sales associate.

849
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,466
Rhonda!

850
00:36:58,175 --> 00:36:59,468
- Rhonda!
- ...put you through to Andrea.

851
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,178
Has anybody fucking seen Rhonda?

852
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,061
<i>Everybody have a good week?</i>

853
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,187
Yeah!

854
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,689
<i>The end of the month.</i>

855
00:37:12,815 --> 00:37:16,193
<i>$28.7 million in gross commissions,</i>

856
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:19,571
<i>all from pink sheet stock, boys!</i>

857
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:23,909
<i>And to celebrate with
our weekly act of debauchery,</i>

858
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,744
<i>I have offered

Yeah!

862

Yeah, you want this?

863
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:37,506
You want this?

<i>Let's scalp her! Scalp her!</i>

865

Let the scalping begin!

Scalp! Scalp! Scalp!

company or what?</i>

870
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:06,243

00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:05,279
Let me ask you, how do you see
the future for Stratton Oakmont?

881
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:06,530
One word?

882
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,742
Diversification.

883
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:12,119
Sounds good. Thank you so much.
I have more than enough.

884
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:13,203
- I appreciate your time.
- Fantastic.

885
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:14,288
Can we get a quick picture?

886
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:18,875
<i>A total fucking hatchet job.</i>

887
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:21,128
<i>This conniving little twat! Look at this!</i>

- Well, my hair looks good.
- Yeah.

"Jordan Belfort, sounding like
a kind of twisted Robin Hood

00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:37,644
- Read that. Read it.
- Listen.

895
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:41,106
There is no such thing
as bad publicity, sweetheart.

896
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,691
Read the article, babe.

897
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:45,235
Jordan, you look great!
You're in a huge magazine.

898
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,903
Big fucking deal I look great.

899
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:49,531
Mr. Belfort! Can you
look at my resume, please?

900
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:51,533
Excuse me, excuse me, sir!

Calm the fuck down!

What the hell's all this?

903
00:40:57,497 --> 00:41:00,208
It's the <i>Forbes</i> article.
They all want to work for you now.

904
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,460
Hey! What did I say?

905
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:02,711
I'm just trying to be nice.

Forbes <i>made me a superstar.</i>

<i>Every day, dozens of money-crazed
kids beat a path to my door.</i>

910
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:19,770
<i>If we hired 'em, they dropped
straight out of college overnight</i>

911
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:23,982
<i>and spent whatever allowance they had
on a new suit from our Stratton tailor.</i>

912
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:25,609
Are you fucking serious right now?

913
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:29,780
<i>I mean, we were literally
putting clothes on these kids' backs.</i>

914
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:32,866
<i>And here comes this jerk-off
sniffing around.</i>

915
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:36,119
<i>But, you know, every time
someone rises up in this world,</i>

916
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:39,581
<i>there's always gonna be
some asshole trying to drag him down.</i>

917
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:44,920
<i>Within months, we doubled in size,
moved to even bigger offices.</i>

918
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:53,595
<i>It was a madhouse.</i>

919
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:55,263
<i>A greed-fest,</i>

920
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:59,267
<i>with equal parts cocaine,
testosterone, and body fluids.</i>

921
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:00,811
Yes!

922
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:05,440
<i>It got so bad, I had to declare
the office a fuck-free zone</i>

923
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:07,442
<i>between the hours of 9:</i><i>00 and 7:</i><i>00.</i>

924
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:10,195
<i>But I'm telling you, even that didn't help.</i>

925
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:13,323
<i>Actually, the madness started
on our very first day,</i>

926
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:14,866
<i>when one of our brokers, Ben Jenner,</i>

927
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,077
<i>christened the elevator
by getting a blow job</i>

928
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,704
<i>from a sales assistant.</i>

929
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:20,664
<i>Her name was Pam, and to her credit,</i>

930
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:25,794
<i>she did have this amazing technique,
with this wild twist and jerk motion.</i>

931
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:27,295
<i>About a month later,</i>

932
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:29,297
<i>Donnie and I decided
to double-team her</i>

933
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:30,549
<i>on a Saturday afternoon</i>

934
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:33,385
<i>while our wives were out
shopping for Christmas dresses.</i>

935
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,053
<i>Eventually, Ben married her,</i>

936
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:37,597
<i>which was pretty amazing
considering she blew</i>

937
00:42:37,681 --> 00:42:39,975
<i>every single guy in the office.</i>

938
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:43,311
<i>Then he got depressed
and killed himself three years later.</i>

939
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:47,858
<i>Anyway, I hired my dad, Max,
to maintain order as the Enforcer.</i>

940
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:49,609
<i>Stratton's very own Gestapo.</i>

941
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:54,489
<i>We called him Mad Max
because of his hair-trigger temper,</i>

942
00:42:54,573 --> 00:42:58,493
<i>which could be set off by something
as innocuous as a ringing telephone.</i>

943
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:02,289
Who the fuck has the goddamn gall

944
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:05,000
to call this house on a Tuesday night?

945
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,252
God damn it!

946
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:08,378
You're gonna miss it!

947
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:10,297
Please, tell me something I don't know.

948
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,133
I wait all week for the fucking <i>Equalizer</i>

949
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:15,510
and they have to fucking... Hello.

950
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:17,304
<i>But as soon as
he picked up the phone...</i>

951
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:18,680
Gene. How are you, Gene?

952
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,724
<i>...he'd affect this weird British accent.</i>

953
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,018
Right-o, Gene, that'd be great.

954
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:24,311
Cheerio.

955
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:25,437
<i>It was absolutely bizarre.</i>

956
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,063
The fucking haltwit!

957
00:43:27,147 --> 00:43:28,190
- <i>He'd hang up...</i>
- You missed it!

958
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:30,525
<i>...and then he's Mad Max all over again.</i>

959
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,651
Damn it!

960
00:43:31,777 --> 00:43:33,945
All right, tell me what happened.
What happened?

961
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,156
Well, he discovered
it was the mother's sister.

962
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,657
Who's he? Who? Tell me who...

963
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:39,326
The main guy.
You know who the main...

964
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:40,494
The main guy...

965
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:42,913
It was his mother's sister.
She showed up dead.

966
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,957
<i>Of course, Mad Max didn't have to know</i>

967
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:47,709
<i>everything we were doing at Stratton.</i>

968
00:43:47,918 --> 00:43:49,836
And then there's a big target and we...

969
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:51,880
They get launched at the target.
They stick.

970
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:54,090
<i>There's a bull's-eye and
the bull's-eye's a dollar sign.</i>

971
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:55,258
<i>Whoever gets closer to the dollar sign</i>

972
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:56,301
gets the most points.

973
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:58,595
I'm gonna throw the shit out
of this little fucking thing.

974
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,597
So if it gets hurt, what happens?

975
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,973
'Cause we're gonna get fucking nuts.

976
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:03,308
I don't think he's gonna get hurt.
They're like...

977
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,143
They got like superhuman strength.

978
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:06,436
I think he's gonna be fine.

979
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,480
You can't look him right in the eyes.

980
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:09,689
You can't look him in the eye?

981
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:11,441
That's a fact. I saw it on PBS.

982
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:13,401
They get confused
and their wires get crossed.

983
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:15,028
You gotta look at their chin.

984
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,154
Like it looks like I'm looking at you

985
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:17,239
but I'm looking at your chin.

986
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:19,491
I feel like you're addressing me
right now, but you're not, are you?

987
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,451
They're like the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>
They find eye contact,

988
00:44:21,535 --> 00:44:23,078
like, wherever you are
standing in the room.

989
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:24,371
And they lock in.

990
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,082
No, but there is a limit
to what we can do with them?

991
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,291
We're allowed to throw shit at 'em.

992
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,793
We're allowed to throw food? Bananas.

993
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:31,336
Any food. Correct.

994
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,462
But, for example, what I wouldn't do is

995
00:44:32,546 --> 00:44:34,297
maybe like tell him to pull his cock out

996
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:36,091
and like get some
of the girls to, you know,

997
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:37,259
fondle him and shit like that.

998
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:38,343
That would be... That's unacceptable?

999
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:39,427
Let's keep that in our back pocket.

1000
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:41,513
This guy is more about
throwing at the dartboard.

1001
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:42,597
Correct. Yes, yes, yes.

1002
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:44,057
The thing is, this is their gift, okay.

1003
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,184
They're built to be thrown
like a lawn dart.

1004
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:47,477
They're top heavy like a lawn dart.

1005
00:44:47,561 --> 00:44:48,562
So they're built for accuracy.

1006
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:50,605
Oh, my God. Can we bowl with this guy?

1007
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:51,773
That's his fucking brother, Rob.

1008
00:44:51,857 --> 00:44:53,191
His brother's the bowling ball.

1009
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:54,985
The brother, you put
a skateboard on him,

1010
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:56,361
you strap him to a skateboard,

1011
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:57,821
you toss him down
an alley at some pins.

1012
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,531
- No shit. That's interesting.
- Swear to fucking God.

1013
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,616
- Can we get that guy?
- Yeah, we'll get that guy, too.

1014
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,785
But it says here this guy
will show his cock. Yeah.

1015
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:05,120
- Instead of growing up. Yeah.
- He will?

1016
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,496
They are very ornery by the way,

1017
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,956
so you gotta be very careful
with these little guys.

1018
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,082
Safety first.

1019
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:10,250
Safety is first, all right?

1020
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,210
I want somebody with
a fucking tranquilizer gun

1021
00:45:12,294 --> 00:45:13,920
ready to knock this fucker out.

1022
00:45:14,004 --> 00:45:16,172
- Do we want to get like a...
- Mace. Taser guns.

1023
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:17,257
A pellet gun maybe?

1024
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,466
No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him.

1025
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,885
I just want him out. Knocked out cold.

1026
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:22,554
But I say we stick with the loophole.
Right? Okay?

1027
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:24,556
If we don't consider him a human,

1028
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,766
we just consider it an act,
I think we're in the clear.

1029
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:27,893
Like The Flying Wallendas.

1030
00:45:27,976 --> 00:45:29,936
You know, a lot of those guys died
but they never sued anybody.

1031
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,771
The important thing
you guys gotta keep in mind

1032
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:33,690
is that these things gossip.

1033
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,400
They get together and they gossip.

1034
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:36,860
- That's a good point.
- And the last thing

1035
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:39,112
that we need is them
getting together and saying,

1036
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,780
"Oh, they made fun of us."

1037
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:42,449
Like, it's gonna make Stratton look bad.

1038
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:44,618
That's why I love you.
You think of shit like that.

1039
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:47,704
When they come in,
we treat it just like one of us. Okay?

1040
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:51,082
One of us. Gooble gobble, one of us.

1041
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:52,751
We accept them, one of us!

1042
00:45:52,918 --> 00:45:54,544
Gooble gobble, one of us.

1043
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:55,962
We accept them, one of us.

1044
00:45:56,046 --> 00:45:57,088
Gooble gobble, one of us!

1045
00:45:57,172 --> 00:45:58,465
Jordan! Your dad's coming.

1046
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:00,008
Something about
the American Express bill.

1047
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:01,259
Can you get him out of here?

1048
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:02,510
Yeah. Lick my twat.

1049
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:03,845
No, I'm serious!

1050
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:06,264
Fuck. Guys, act like we're working.

1051
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:07,807
You got any fucking stock forms?

1052
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:09,434
He's coming, he's coming.

1053
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,685
Make some shit up.

1054
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:12,771
I think if we short Pfizer...

1055
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:17,776
$430,000 in one month, Jordy, huh?

1056
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:23,198
Four hundred and fucking 30,000
fucking dollars in one fucking month!

1057
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,450
Good morning.
They're business expenses. Relax.

1058
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:26,743
- Business expenses?
- Yes.

1059
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,244
- Jordy, look what you got here.
- What?

1060
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:32,207
Look at this. $26,000
for one fucking dinner!

1061
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:34,000
Okay. No, no. This could be explained.

1062
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,503
Dad, we had clients. The Pfizer clients.

1063
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:38,463
Right. The porterhouse from Argentina.

1064
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,799
Expensive champagne and...
We had to buy champagne.

1065
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:42,384
And you ordered all the fucking sides.

1066
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,427
- Tell him about the sides.
- I ordered sides, so...

1067
00:46:44,511 --> 00:46:47,973
Sides? $26,000 worth of sides?

1068
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:50,392
What are these sides?
They cure cancer?

1069
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,352
The sides did cure cancer.
That's the problem.

1070
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:53,853
That's why they were expensive.

1071
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,855
- Shut the fuck up.
- I'm serious.

1072
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:57,941
- Stop.
- And EJ Entertainment?

1073
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,818
What the fuck is EJ Entertainment?

1074
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:02,654
Well, that's...

1075
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:03,822
Yeah, Jordy, what's EJ Entertainment?

1076
00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:04,990
How do I describe this?

1077
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:06,074
Jord, what is that?

1078
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,243
- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy!
- I know.

1079
00:47:08,368 --> 00:47:10,412
- That's what it is!
- That is what it is.

1080
00:47:10,537 --> 00:47:12,497
Isn't that the perfect description for it?

1081
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,166
That is what it is.
But none of these were charged to me.

1082
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,584
This is all of them.

1083
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,461
- Oh, that was all us?
- It wasn't me though.

1084
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:20,380
Fucking explain this shit to him!

1085
00:47:20,547 --> 00:47:23,425
These are all of your
fucking charges right here!

1086
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,677
The IRS, they allow for T&A. It's fine.

1087
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,928
T&E!

1088
00:47:27,012 --> 00:47:28,096
T&E!

1089
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,222
Yeah. I said T&E.

1090
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:30,598
- No, no. You said T&A.
- No, I didn't.

1091
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:31,683
Yeah, you did.

1092
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,060
- When did I say that?
- You said T&A. It's T&E.

1093
00:47:34,144 --> 00:47:35,437
I know you're upset about the dinner,

1094
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,816
and that makes sense because we did
spend too much money. But I said T&E.

1095
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:41,526
Don't tell me what you said.
I heard what you said.

1096
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:42,902
- Dad. He said T&A.
- He did?

1097
00:47:42,986 --> 00:47:44,362
Absolutely, no question.

1098
00:47:44,446 --> 00:47:45,572
I'm trying to...

1099
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:46,698
I'm getting this close!

1100
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:47,991
- Dad, relax.
- I'm getting this close.

1101
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:50,535
That's what I'm saying.
I want you to open up more, Max.

1102
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:51,661
He's gonna fucking kill you.

1103
00:47:51,745 --> 00:47:53,288
Why do you hold it in? Why do you...

1104
00:47:53,455 --> 00:47:55,081
Max, why do you hold it in?

1105
00:47:55,165 --> 00:47:56,875
That's it. Get the fuck out of here!

1106
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,294
- No, no, no!
- Asshole, get out of here.

1107
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,463
What kind of hooker takes credit cards?

1108
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:02,589
A rich one.

1109
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:05,008
<i>At Stratton, there were
three kinds of hookers.</i>

1110
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:07,385
<i>The Blue Chips, top of
the line, model material.</i>

1111
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:08,970
<i>They cost between $300 and $500</i>

1112
00:48:09,054 --> 00:48:11,848
<i>and you had to wear a condom
unless you gave them a hefty tip,</i>

1113
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,808
<i>which, of course, I always did.</i>

1114
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:17,520
<i>Then came the NASDAQs,
who were pretty, not great.</i>

1115
00:48:17,604 --> 00:48:19,939
<i>They cost between 200 and 300 bucks.</i>

1116
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:22,484
<i>Finally, there were
the Pink Sheets. Skanks.</i>

1117
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:25,487
<i>They cost about 100 or less.
If you didn't wear a condom,</i>

1118
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:26,821
<i>you'd have to get a penicillin shot</i>

1119
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:29,282
<i>the next day
and pray your dick didn't fall off</i>

1120
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,201
<i>Not that we didn't fuck them, too.</i>

1121
00:48:31,493 --> 00:48:33,119
<i>Believe me, we did.</i>

1122
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:35,997
It's that slipped disc thing again.

1123
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:38,500
I know what it is. You know, too much...

1124
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:40,335
...with EJ Entertainment.

1125
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,419
Pops.

1126
00:48:41,503 --> 00:48:42,837
How are things at home?

1127
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:44,506
Well, not the best.

1128
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:47,133
She just doesn't...
You know what I'm saying?

1129
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:48,718
It's like the smell...

1130
00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:50,386
There's a smell,
there's an attraction thing.

1131
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:53,056
After a while it kind of
fades away a little bit.

1132
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:54,808
Yeah, well. It's supposed to fade away.

1133
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:56,810
- Supposed to?
- That's marriage. You know...

1134
00:48:56,935 --> 00:48:59,521
Your mother and I, we've been
married a long, long time.

1135
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:00,772
What do you think? We're...

1136
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:02,690
We're jumping into bed
every two minutes?

1137
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,150
- It doesn't work that way.
- I love her to death.

1138
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,402
I want to stay married, Dad, but...

1139
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:07,821
It's crazy out there.

1140
00:49:07,904 --> 00:49:09,405
Some of these girls...
You should see them.

1141
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:10,740
Oh, my God!

1142
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:12,450
They're fucking...

1143
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:14,410
The things they're doing now, Pops.

1144
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:16,830
I mean... I mean, it's on
a whole other level.

1145
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:18,498
- Really?
- And they're all shaved, too.

1146
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,041
- Get out of here!
- All shaven.

1147
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:21,543
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.

1148
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,837
- Bald as a china doll.
- No bush?

1149
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,922
- No bush.
- Oh, my God!

1150
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:29,634
All of a sudden, one week, nobody
had anything down there anymore.

1151
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:30,802
It's a new world.

1152
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,804
They're bald from the eyebrows down.

1153
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:35,348
- Wow.
- Nothing. Not a stitch. It's like lasers.

1154
00:49:35,557 --> 00:49:36,766
Wow. A new world.

1155
00:49:37,392 --> 00:49:39,894
I was born too... Too early.

1156
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:42,188
I've never been a fan
of the bush, to be honest.

1157
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,606
- Really?
- Yeah.

1158
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:44,774
I don't mind it.

1159
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,276
Dad.

1160
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:48,736
I don't want you stressing out
about any of this.

1161
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:50,071
How can I not get stressed out?

1162
00:49:50,155 --> 00:49:51,531
Look at the knuckleheads
you got working for you.

1163
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:52,824
I know they're knuckleheads

1164
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,118
but I need them to want
to live like me, you get it?

1165
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:56,578
To live like me.

1166
00:49:56,953 --> 00:49:58,037
Jordy.

1167
00:49:58,163 --> 00:50:01,875
One of these days, the chickens
are gonna come home to roost.

1168
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,670
You're looking at me like I'm crazy.

1169
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:09,132
Crazy? This is obscene.

1170
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:10,758
<i>It was obscene.</i>

1171
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:12,468
<i>In the normal world.</i>

1172
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:14,971
<i>But who the fuck wanted to live there?</i>

1173
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,808
<i>Go party your fucking cocks off!</i>

1174
00:50:21,603 --> 00:50:25,773
<i>We are about to become
fucking legends</i>

1175
00:50:25,899 --> 00:50:27,734
<i>on Wall Street!</i>

1176
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:32,322
<i>We got plans up here
that's gonna take this company</i>

1177
00:50:32,405 --> 00:50:35,366
<i>into the fucking stratosphere!</i>

1178
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,121
Wolfie! Wolfie!

1179
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:45,919
Fuck Merrill Lynch. Fuck them.

1180
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:48,546
Why should they be taking all our
fucking money all the fucking time?

1181
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:49,797
This way we become the underwriters.

1182
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:51,424
<i>It was our next big move.</i>

1183
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:55,094
<i>Finding companies to take public. IPOs.</i>

1184
00:50:55,178 --> 00:50:56,971
<i>It was the only way
these Wall Street pricks</i>

1185
00:50:57,055 --> 00:51:00,767
<i>would ever stop thinking of us
as some shit kicker bucket shop.</i>

1186
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,060
We got Arncliffe International.

1187
00:51:02,227 --> 00:51:03,686
<i>See, we were a little different.</i>

1188
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:07,357
<i>We liked to get as fucked up as
possible during our business powwows</i>

1189
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,901
<i>in order to stimulate
our free-flowing ideas,</i>

1190
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:12,987
<i>which is why we were popping
these ludes like they were M&M's.</i>

1191
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:15,156
Steve Madden.

1192
00:51:16,658 --> 00:51:17,825
We own the fucking companies...

1193
00:51:18,534 --> 00:51:19,702
We own the companies...

1194
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:21,704
<i>Don't know what a lude is? I'll tell you.</i>

1195
00:51:21,871 --> 00:51:23,831
<i>Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

1196
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:28,670
<i>Looks like those ludes are working
their magic on Donnie right now.</i>

1197
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:03,454
<i>The Quaalude,</i>

1198
00:52:03,538 --> 00:52:06,457
<i>or lude, as it is commonly referred to,</i>

1199
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:09,043
<i>was first synthesized in 1951</i>

1200
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:11,796
<i>by an Indian doctor,
that's dots, not feathers,</i>

1201
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,298
<i>as a sedative,</i>

1202
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:17,218
<i>and was prescribed to stressed-out
housewives with sleep disorders.</i>

1203
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,138
<i>But pretty soon someone figured out</i>

1204
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:23,975
<i>that if you resisted the urge to sleep
for just 15 minutes,</i>

1205
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:26,394
<i>you got a pretty kick-ass high from it.</i>

1206
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:30,398
<i>Didn't take long for people
to start abusing ludes, of course.</i>

1207
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:33,651
<i>And in 1982,
the U.S. government Schedule 1'd them.</i>

1208
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,903
<i>Along with the rest of the world.</i>

1209
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:39,282
<i>Which meant there was
only a finite amount of these things left.</i>

1210
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:42,327
<i>No shit, you can't
even buy 'em anymore.</i>

1211
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:44,912
<i>You people are all shit out of luck.</i>

1212
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,497
What are you saying? What is it?

1213
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:47,749
Steve Madden.

1214
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:49,751
Steve Madden.

1215
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:51,127
Steve.

1216
00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:52,378
Steve.

1217
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,130
<i>You remember those ads?</i>

1218
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:56,591
<i>Those giant-headed girls
with the bug eyes</i>

1219
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,301
<i>wearing those big clunky shoes?</i>

1220
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,595
My friend from school, Steve Madden.

1221
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,055
His friend from school, Steve Madden.

1222
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:04,932
<i>Steve Madden was the name
in women's shoes at the moment.</i>

1223
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:08,728
<i>And all of Wall Street was
begging to take his company public.</i>

1224
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,063
Go ahead, go ahead, what is it?

1225
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:11,439
<i>Except, guess who grew up with him?</i>

1226
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,316
- Women's shoes.
- Women's shoes.

1227
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:15,943
<i>My very own Vice President.</i>

1228

Steve.

1232
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:25,036
Hey, JB, JB, JB, JB.

1233
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,287
You gotta come check
this fucking chick out.

1234
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:28,122
Look at this. Look.

1235
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:36,089
I would fuck that girl
if she was my sister.

1236
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:38,633
I would let that girl
give me fucking AIDS.

1237
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,427
You want to see the Wolf handle this?

1238
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:44,889
She's hot.

1239
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:46,724
Cristy.

1240
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:53,689
Jordan, this is my friend Naomi.

1241
00:53:53,815 --> 00:53:56,359
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Naomi.

1242
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:57,985
Naomi, nice to meet you.

1243
00:53:58,111 --> 00:53:59,821
You got an awesome place here.

1244
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:02,240
I've don't think I've ever been
in a house this big before.

1245
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:03,491
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1246
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:04,784
Beautiful beach out there.

1247
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,035
Blair Hollingsworth.

1248
00:54:07,078 --> 00:54:08,329
Hi, Blair. Nice to meet you.

1249
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:10,039
- Your name's Blair, right?
- Yeah.

1250
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:11,416
You like to Jet Ski?

1251
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:13,084
I've never done it before.

1252
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,168
You've never Jet Ski'd in your life?

1253
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:15,253
No, I've never Jet Ski'd.

1254
00:54:15,336 --> 00:54:16,754
You've never been on a Jet Ski?

1255
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:18,005
How many times
are you gonna ask her?

1256
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:19,465
She's never been on a Jet Ski.

1257
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:22,176
I don't know.
Might ask her a couple more times.

1258
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:24,846
Okay. Sure.

1259
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:27,765
Hi. I'm Hildy. Nice to meet you.

1260
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:29,851
- Hi.
- Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

1261
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,352
Yeah, I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

1262
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:32,770
Just tell her I'll be
out in a couple of minutes.

1263
00:54:32,854 --> 00:54:34,313
Why don't you tell your wife that?

1264
00:54:34,397 --> 00:54:35,398
I might do that, but I'm having

1265
00:54:35,481 --> 00:54:37,024
- a conversation right now.
- What am I, your secretary?

1266
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:38,943
You know what,
I think we should get going.

1267
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,194
Wait, wait. Where you guys going?

1268
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,737
We gotta go.
We got two other parties to go to.

1269
00:54:41,904 --> 00:54:43,489
- We can stay for a drink.
- Yeah, stay for a drink.

1270
00:54:43,823 --> 00:54:45,867
No. We got two other parties
we're supposed to get to.

1271
00:54:45,992 --> 00:54:47,118
But we can stay for a drink...

1272
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:48,369
She's

1273
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:50,204
perfect.

1274
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:51,831
- You like champagne?
- I do.

1275
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:52,957
She's perfect.

1276
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,417
Donnie, what the fuck are you doing?

1277
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,210
You piece of...

1278
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:06,512
You're gonna have
to excuse my friend. He gets...

1279
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:07,972
Get the fuck out!

1280
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:10,099
Jordan, you gotta fuck her, bro.
She's so hot!

1281
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:11,267
Yeah, Donnie!

1282
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:14,353
Let him fucking finish, Hildy.

1283
00:55:14,437 --> 00:55:16,063
That's fucking rude.

1284
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:17,982
Have some fucking manners.

1285
00:55:21,861 --> 00:55:23,946
So, Bay Ridge,
that's near Staten Island, right?

1286
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:26,365
Brooklyn, across the Verrazano Bridge.

1287
00:55:26,616 --> 00:55:28,034
<i>Saturday Night</i> Fever territory.

1288
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:29,660
That's right. Guinea Gulch.

1289
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:32,038
We call the Verrazano Bridge
the Guinea Gangplank.

1290
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:33,206
Right.

1291
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:34,916
So I presume you're Italian?

1292
00:55:35,124 --> 00:55:36,209
On my dad's side.

1293
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:39,504
I'm also Dutch, German, English.

1294
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:41,088
I'm a mutt.

1295
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:42,590
Yeah. You're a mutt.

1296
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:45,009
Yeah, I still have family
over there though, in London.

1297
00:55:45,218 --> 00:55:47,803
My Aunt Emma. She's the best.

1298
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:50,848
Very British, you know.
She's a classy lady.

1299
00:55:50,932 --> 00:55:52,266
That explains it then.

1300
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:53,351
Explains what?

1301
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:56,229
It explains you. I mean,
you're a duchess, right?

1302
00:55:56,354 --> 00:55:58,731
The Duchess of Bay Ridge.

1303
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:02,860
Excuse me.

1304
00:56:02,944 --> 00:56:04,946
Could I get a straw, please?

1305
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,573
Thank you.

1306
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:15,831
So I was a little surprised
you asked Cristy for my number.

1307
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:18,167
Why is that?

1308
00:56:19,961 --> 00:56:21,879
Aren't you married?

1309
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,424
Well... Yeah, but what?

1310
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:27,593
Married people can't have friends?

1311
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,264
We're gonna be friends?

1312
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:35,560
Yeah. You don't want to be my friend?

1313
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:41,732
We're not gonna be friends.

1314
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:52,451
And at night I work on my designs.

1315
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:55,246
I have an entire line of lingerie.

1316
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:58,207
You know, camisoles, bustiers, panties.

1317
00:56:59,292 --> 00:57:01,627
<i>She designs women's panties, too?</i>

1318
00:57:01,711 --> 00:57:03,421
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1319
00:57:13,681 --> 00:57:16,392
<i>Come on, Jordan, think of a way
to get up to her apartment.</i>

1320
00:57:21,522 --> 00:57:23,983
You wanna come up for
some tea or something?

1321
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,944
Tea? Yeah.

1322
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:28,946
- Like hot tea?
- Yeah.

1323
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:30,323
Oh, yeah. That sounds nice. Yeah.

1324
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,700
<i>Tea. Fuck, yeah, I wanted
to come up forte a.</i>

1325
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,745
Like Darjeeling or rose hip,
something nice like that?

1326
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:36,954
Sure.

1327
00:57:37,038 --> 00:57:38,372
This is Rocky.

1328
00:57:38,456 --> 00:57:40,666
Oh, who's this? Say hi, Rocky.

1329
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,001
Hi, sweetheart.

1330
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:43,377
Okay.

1331
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:46,547
Why don't you light a fire or something
and I'll be right out.

1332
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:48,924
- Yeah. Fire, here?
- Sure.

1333
00:57:52,345 --> 00:57:53,888
I like your painting here. It's...

1334
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:03,648
<i>God, help me. How do I fuck this girl?</i>

1335
00:58:07,193 --> 00:58:08,277
You all right?

1336
00:58:08,361 --> 00:58:10,696
Yeah, yeah. Just trying
to light the fire here.

1337
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,912
<i>That's it. That's it, you're leaving.</i>

1338
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:19,872
<i>Don't get involved.
Go home to your wife.</i>

1339
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,676
<i>As you can probably guess,</i>

1340
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:34,303
<i>I fucked her goddamn brains out...</i>

1341
00:58:34,804 --> 00:58:36,138
Jesus Lord!

1342
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:40,601
<i>For 11 seconds.</i>

1343
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:52,988
Did you just come?

1344
00:58:53,114 --> 00:58:55,032
Oh, yeah, I just came.

1345
00:58:56,075 --> 00:58:57,410
Did you? Did you come?

1346
00:58:57,618 --> 00:58:59,203
- No.
- No?

1347
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:00,371
Okay.

1348
00:59:00,496 --> 00:59:02,623
I'm still hard so just give me a sec.

1349
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:05,126
Sure.

1350
00:59:05,418 --> 00:59:07,044
Come on, baby, come on.

1351
00:59:09,672 --> 00:59:11,757
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1352
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:19,014
Oh, God!

1353
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:21,016
Fuck off, Rocky! Bad dog.

1354
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:22,518
You have a biscuit
or something like that?

1355
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:23,686
It's okay.

1356
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,229
- Just keep going.
- Rocky, go play.

1357
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:27,189
Go play, Rocky. Go, go, go, go.

1358
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:31,068
You're crazy.

1359
00:59:31,152 --> 00:59:32,403
<i>I couldn't get enough.</i>

1360
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:34,822
<i>I mean, her pussy
was like heroin to me.</i>

1361
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:37,658
<i>And it wasn't just about the sex, either.</i>

1362
00:59:37,742 --> 00:59:39,744
<i>Naomi and I got along. I mean, we...</i>

1363
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:41,662
<i>We had similar interests and shit.</i>

1364
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:48,627
Choo-choo train.

1365
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,004
Yeah.

1366
00:59:57,178 --> 01:00:00,890
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.

1367
01:00:06,896 --> 01:00:10,191
Yeah, yeah.
Let's toke it all on there, huh?

1368
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:13,402
Oh, shit!

1369
01:00:23,996 --> 01:00:25,164
You!

1370
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:27,291
Get out of the fucking car!

1371
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:28,709
Jesus Christ.

1372
01:00:28,793 --> 01:00:31,378
Son of a bitch! Oh, fuck!

1373
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:34,465
Relax, sweetheart. Relax.

1374
01:00:35,049 --> 01:00:37,259
- Son of a fucking bitch!
- Okay, okay... Geez!

1375
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:38,636
Okay, babe, stop!

1376
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:39,845
Please.

1377
01:00:39,929 --> 01:00:41,013
Bitch!

1378
01:00:41,764 --> 01:00:43,390
- What are you doing...
- That whore from the party?

1379
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:44,975
Jesus Christ!

1380
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:46,143
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1381
01:00:46,227 --> 01:00:47,478
I thought you were at the fucking beach!

1382
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,896
I didn't know you were here!

1383
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,523
That's where you've fucking been?

1384
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:52,316
With that fucking whore from the party?

1385
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:53,818
I thought you were at the beach house.

1386
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:55,277
How could you do this to me?

1387
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:58,155
- Sweetie, come on...
- Who the fuck are you, Jordan?

1388
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,991
You're like a completely
different fucking person!

1389
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:04,203
I made a mistake.
I don't know what to tell you, babe. I...

1390
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:05,913
I'm sorry.

1391
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,874
- I'm sorry.
- Is that who... Is that what you want?

1392
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:20,427
Do you love her?

1393
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,560
Answer me.

1394
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:51,208
<i>I felt horrible.</i>

1395
01:01:52,084 --> 01:01:54,044
<i>Three days later, I filed for a divorce</i>

1396
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:55,880
<i>and moved Naomi into the apartment.</i>

1397
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:03,888
<i>Say what you will,
but the Duchess did have style.</i>

1398
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:07,099
<i>She brought in a decorator,
feng shui'd the whole place.</i>

1399
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:09,560
<i>She even hired a gay butler.</i>

1400
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:12,229
<i>This guy was smart,
sophisticated, professional.</i>

1401
01:02:12,313 --> 01:02:13,898
<i>Really, really great.</i>

1402
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:15,316
Is that jasmine?

1403
01:02:15,691 --> 01:02:18,319
Yes, sir. I tried to stump you
this evening. Very good.

1404
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:20,279
Very good. Great nose.

1405
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:22,031
<i>Except forth at one time.</i>

1406
01:02:27,453 --> 01:02:28,704
Oh, my God!

1407
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:31,665
Oh, hey.

1408
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:33,417
Is it Wednesday already?

1409
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:35,628
Oh, don't stop.

1410
01:02:35,711 --> 01:02:36,795
What the fuck!

1411
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:39,006
That is fucked up!

1412
01:02:39,465 --> 01:02:40,674
He must have thought we were still

1413
01:02:40,758 --> 01:02:42,343
at the Hamptons
this weekend, you know.

1414
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:43,802
Where were they doing it,
sweetheart? In the bedroom?

1415
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:46,555
They were everywhere. There were
two guys over there on the table.

1416
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:47,890
There were more over here.

1417
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,433
There were four right here.

1418
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:51,185
Are you fucking serious? Right there?

1419
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:54,104
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Oh, baby, it gets worse.

1420
01:02:55,606 --> 01:02:58,150
After they left, I checked the apartment.

1421
01:02:58,275 --> 01:02:59,360
Right. What?

1422
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:01,528
What is it, babe? What?

1423
01:03:01,862 --> 01:03:02,947
<i>Where's my money?</i>

1424
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,031
I don't know where your money...

1425
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:06,116
Where is my fucking money?
Where is it?

1426
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:08,160
I don't know where
your money is, Mr. Belfort.

1427
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:10,496
- I didn't do anything.
- If you don't get...

1428
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:11,872
He's lying through his fucking teeth.

1429
01:03:11,956 --> 01:03:13,123
Let's start from the beginning.

1430
01:03:13,207 --> 01:03:14,458
Let's start from the beginning, all right?

1431
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:16,085
You invited some friends over, right?

1432
01:03:16,377 --> 01:03:18,045
One thing led to another.
Things got out of hand.

1433
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,630
We understand that, we do.

1434
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:22,132
We do blow all the time.
We're fucking degenerates ourselves.

1435
01:03:22,216 --> 01:03:23,300
Look at us, right?

1436
01:03:23,384 --> 01:03:24,969
But money was stolen
from my apartment.

1437
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:26,637
Right from my sock drawer. All right?

1438
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,806
Like I said, I don't know
where your money is.

1439
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:30,265
Just start from the beginning.
Who came over?

1440
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:31,392
It was just a normal day.

1441
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:32,810
I knew you were coming home
the next day.

1442
01:03:32,893 --> 01:03:35,145
So everything would be fine.
It'd be cleaned up.

1443
01:03:35,229 --> 01:03:37,147
I got a little high at breakfast.

1444
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:39,024
So I got a little happy. I had some eggs,

1445
01:03:39,108 --> 01:03:40,109
I had a little bit of ice cream.

1446
01:03:40,192 --> 01:03:42,027
And then I said,
"Who do I know that likes ice cream?"

1447
01:03:42,111 --> 01:03:43,570
It's my friend, Rudy. So I called Rudy.

1448
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:46,115
- Who's Rudy?
- Yeah, who's Rudy?

1449
01:03:47,658 --> 01:03:50,995
- You know who Rudy is. Come on.
- Me? I don't...

1450
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:52,204
- You know...
- Who the fuck is Rudy?

1451
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:53,330
I don't know anyone named Rudy.

1452
01:03:53,414 --> 01:03:54,498
Last month. The Lollipop Club.

1453
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:56,041
You know who Rudy was. Dancing...

1454
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:57,543
You know who Rudy is?

1455
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:00,629
I don't fucking know any...

1456
01:04:00,713 --> 01:04:01,672
What do you mean?

1457
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:02,840
So he went to The Lollipop Club?

1458
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:04,508
Oh, he was
at The Lollipop Club for sure.

1459
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,176
On the stage, grinding with everybody.

1460
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:08,262
I got fucked up. I like to dance.

1461
01:04:08,387 --> 01:04:09,888
I don't know.
Maybe I met him, maybe I didn't.

1462
01:04:09,972 --> 01:04:11,598
I meet a lot of fucking people.

1463
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:13,350
- What are you saying?
- $50,000 was stolen

1464
01:04:13,434 --> 01:04:14,643
from my fucking sock drawer!

1465
01:04:14,727 --> 01:04:16,228
All my girlfriend's jewelry is gone.

1466
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:18,230
- Where the fuck is it?
- ...Rudy. What the fuck?

1467
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:20,357
Did your fucking little faggot
friend Rudy take my shit?

1468
01:04:20,441 --> 01:04:22,109
Did he? Answer me!

1469
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:24,695
Okay. Now I get it. Now I get why I'm...

1470
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:25,988
This is a gay thing.

1471
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:27,656
See, all of you...

1472
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:29,283
You think this is 'cause you're a fag?

1473
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:31,410
My cousin's a fucking faggot.

1474
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:33,871
And I go on vacation with him
and his boyfriend. I love fags.

1475
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:35,080
You were in charge, right?

1476
01:04:35,164 --> 01:04:36,874
I will not be stolen from. You get that?

1477
01:04:36,957 --> 01:04:39,126
I fucking like gay people. I don't like you.

1478
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,837
He should've hired a fucking Mexican
like I have in my fucking house.

1479
01:04:43,589 --> 01:04:45,049
Shit! What the fuck...

1480
01:04:49,303 --> 01:04:50,637
Talk, you fuck, talk!

1481
01:04:50,721 --> 01:04:51,847
I'm gonna drop you, you faggot!

1482
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,098
Where is it?

1483
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:56,310
<i>Chester and Toby,
they went all yakuza on Nicholas.</i>

1484
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:57,478
<i>You know, they got crazy.</i>

1485
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:58,604
I don't know!

1486
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:02,316
<i>I had to call the cops just to keep
them from killing the poor guy.</i>

1487
01:05:02,441 --> 01:05:06,028
<i>I gave them each 1,000 bucks
and told them what Nicholas had done.</i>

1488
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,696
<i>Then they kicked his ass.</i>

1489
01:05:08,155 --> 01:05:09,531
Thanks again, Officer.

1490
01:05:09,865 --> 01:05:12,534
<i>It's not like I cared about
the 50 grand anyway.</i>

1491
01:05:12,618 --> 01:05:14,244
<i>I was making that much
almost every day</i>

1492
01:05:14,328 --> 01:05:16,580
<i>through one rat hole or another.</i>

1493
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:19,416
<i>Now a rat hole is a friend,
like Brad here,</i>

1494
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:22,044
<i>who held stock in his name for me.</i>

1495
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:24,379
Who are you supposed to be, huh?
Jack Nickle-Jew?

1496
01:05:24,463 --> 01:05:29,259
<i>I'd drive the price up then he'd sell
and kick most of the profits back to...</i>

1497
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,178
<i>You guessed it, me.</i>

1498
01:05:33,931 --> 01:05:36,475
<i>All cash. None of it's on the books.</i>

1499
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:38,852
<i>A big no-no, of course,
in the eyes of the law.</i>

1500
01:05:39,895 --> 01:05:42,856
<i>Enter our new securities
attorney, Manny Riskin.</i>

1501
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,610
<i>700 bucks an hour
to be the voice of doom.</i>

1502
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:48,445
Listen to me. You piss up the SEC's leg,

1503
01:05:48,529 --> 01:05:49,738
you end up with your tits in a ringer.

1504
01:05:49,822 --> 01:05:52,825
Do not worry about it.
I have the SEC under control.

1505
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,661
What the fuck
are these imbeciles doing?

1506
01:05:55,786 --> 01:05:57,121
Hey! Hey!

1507
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:58,497
What are you doing? Hey!

1508
01:05:58,664 --> 01:06:00,541
We got the SEC in here.

1509
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:02,709
<i>The Securities
and Exchange Commission</i>

1510
01:06:02,793 --> 01:06:05,379
<i>sent two lawyers down
to review our files.</i>

1511
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,381
<i>So I set them up in our conference room</i>

1512
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,549
<i>and I had it bugged</i>

1513
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:10,843
<i>and the air conditioning
turned up so high</i>

1514
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:12,469
<i>that it felt like Antarctica in there.</i>

1515
01:06:12,553 --> 01:06:14,513
Is it always this cold in here?

1516
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:15,639
I don't know.

1517
01:06:15,722 --> 01:06:16,890
<i>Then, while they were looking</i>

1518
01:06:16,974 --> 01:06:18,392
<i>for a smoking gun in that room...</i>

1519
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:20,269
Arncliffe International is on fire.

1520
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:23,605
<i>...I was gonna fire off a bazooka in here,</i>

1521
01:06:23,689 --> 01:06:25,941
<i>offering up our latest IPO.</i>

1522
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:28,527
An IPO is an initial public offering.

1523
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:32,364
It's the first time a stock is offered
for sale to the general population.

1524
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:34,324
Now, as the firm taking
the company public,

1525
01:06:34,408 --> 01:06:36,076
we set the initial sales price

1526
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,912
then sold those shares
right back to our friends. The...

1527
01:06:39,163 --> 01:06:40,622
Look.

1528
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:42,583
I know you're not following
what I'm saying anyway, right?

1529
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,626
That's okay. That doesn't matter.

1530
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:46,545
The real question is this.

1531
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:48,505
"Was all this legal?"

1532
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:50,465
Absolutely fucking not.

1533
01:06:50,841 --> 01:06:53,260
But we were making more money
than we knew what to do with.

1534
01:06:57,639 --> 01:06:58,765
<i>And what do you do when you're making</i>

1535
01:06:58,849 --> 01:07:00,309
<i>more money
than you know what to do with?</i>

1536
01:07:06,315 --> 01:07:07,733
Oh, my God!

1537
01:07:08,108 --> 01:07:09,776
Will you marry me?

1538
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:11,653
Oh, my God.

1539
01:07:11,737 --> 01:07:13,739
Is that a yes?

1540
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:15,490
Are you sure?

1541
01:07:15,574 --> 01:07:17,451
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure.

1542
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,494
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1543
01:07:29,922 --> 01:07:33,383
<i>I held my bachelor party
at the Mirage in Las Vegas.</i>

1544
01:07:33,634 --> 01:07:35,844
<i>The flight there alone was a bacchanal.</i>

1545
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:40,057
<i>One last blowout for the gods
before I settled down for good.</i>

1546
01:07:40,474 --> 01:07:41,892
<i>A hundred Strattonites,</i>

1547
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:44,770
<i>50 hookers, plus 50 more waiting
once we landed.</i>

1548
01:07:45,479 --> 01:07:46,480
<i>Oh, and the drugs.</i>

1549
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:50,400
<i>I mean, I tell you, our plane was
like a pharmacy with wings.</i>

1550
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:23,183
<i>All told, the weekend
cost me two million bucks,</i>

1551
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:28,272
<i>including the cost
of refurbishing the entire 28th floor.</i>

1552
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:31,191
...kiss the bride.

1553
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:36,238
<i>But the wedding
was something out of a fairy tale.</i>

1554
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:39,408
<i>With Naomi, my Duchess,</i>

1555
01:08:39,491 --> 01:08:40,993
<i>me, her handsome Duke,</i>

1556
01:08:41,076 --> 01:08:44,121
<i>and The Bahamas Ocean Club,
our castle.</i>

1557
01:08:54,965 --> 01:08:57,843
<i>Of course, after the bachelor party,
me, the Duke,</i>

1558
01:08:57,926 --> 01:09:00,679
<i>needed a few penicillin shots
so he could</i>

1559
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:02,889
<i>safely consummate the marriage.</i>

1560
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:10,063
Hey! Barry Kleinman,
filming the wedding.

1561
01:09:10,272 --> 01:09:11,565
A few words for your son?

1562
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:14,318
Jordan. Remember what I told you.

1563
01:09:14,401 --> 01:09:17,529
It involves your penis and her vagina.

1564
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:20,574
And you know, you know
what you can do, Jordy.

1565
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,384
Oh, my God!

1566
01:09:39,468 --> 01:09:40,844
Aunt Emma?

1567
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,933
I can't believe you came!

1568
01:09:47,434 --> 01:09:50,604
Jordan! Jordan! Look who came!

1569
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:52,439
It's Aunt Emma.

1570
01:09:53,482 --> 01:09:54,608
Aunt Emma.

1571
01:09:54,733 --> 01:09:57,069
- Oh, Jordan, dear, how lovely.
- Hey, how you doing?

1572
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:00,614
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you in person.

1573
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:02,616
Into the donuts, I see.

1574
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:05,035
Oh, I... I...

1575
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:06,328
Well...

1576
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,456
I lived through the '60s, my dear.

1577
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:10,999
Enjoy the day.

1578
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:13,502
She surprised me. I didn't even know.

1579
01:10:27,808 --> 01:10:29,351
Just one more step. Are you ready?

1580
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:31,019
- Where are we going?
- Keep your eyes closed.

1581
01:10:31,103 --> 01:10:32,479
One, two, three!

1582
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:36,024
What is this?

1583
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:38,151
- It's your wedding present.
- What?

1584
01:10:38,235 --> 01:10:39,569
It's your wedding present, sweetheart.

1585
01:10:41,029 --> 01:10:42,406
What?

1586
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:44,991
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

1587
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:46,201
A fucking yacht?

1588
01:10:46,827 --> 01:10:49,204
<i>For millionaires
whose ships have come in,</i>

1589
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:52,082
<i>pricey pleasure boats
are for the most fun afloat.</i>

1590
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:55,252
<i>It's no coincidence that
its 150 feet of green hull</i>

1591
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:57,504
<i>is the color of cash. Anchors aweigh!</i>

1592
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,840
Oh, my God! Baby!

1593
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:03,802
- I think you like it?
- You're crazy.

1594
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:05,303
- You like it?
- Yes!

1595
01:11:10,976 --> 01:11:13,770
<i>For three weeks, we sailed
the</i> Naomi <i>through the Caribbean,</i>

1596
01:11:13,854 --> 01:11:15,856
<i>eventually taking her home
to Long Island,</i>

1597
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:17,023
<i>where we bought a house.</i>

1598
01:11:17,107 --> 01:11:19,693
<i>Seven acres on
the Gold Coast of Long Island.</i>

1599
01:11:19,818 --> 01:11:22,279
<i>The most expensive
real estate in the world.</i>

1600
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:25,031
<i>With maids, cooks, landscapers,
you name it.</i>

1601
01:11:25,115 --> 01:11:27,576
<i>We even had two guards
who worked in shifts.</i>

1602
01:11:27,701 --> 01:11:28,743
<i>Both named Rocco.</i>

1603
01:11:32,873 --> 01:11:34,958
<i>It was heaven on earth.</i>

1604
01:11:37,836 --> 01:11:39,296
Wake up, you piece of shit!

1605
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:41,089
Who's Venice?

1606
01:11:41,173 --> 01:11:42,507
- Huh?
- Who?

1607
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,592
Who? Who?

1608
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:45,343
"Who?" What are you, a fucking owl?

1609
01:11:45,427 --> 01:11:46,595
Who is she?

1610
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,138
Some little hooker
you were fucking last night?

1611
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:50,140
What the fuck are
you talking about? No.

1612
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:51,808
No way, baby, no!

1613
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:54,227
You were calling
her name in your sleep!

1614
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:56,938
Are you out of your
fucking mind? I don't...

1615
01:11:57,481 --> 01:11:59,149
I don't even know who Venice is.

1616
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:01,443
What the fuck does that
even mean? Venice.

1617
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:04,279
That's the stupidest shit
I've ever heard in my fucking life!

1618
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:10,243
Venice...

1619
01:12:10,744 --> 01:12:12,829
Venice, baby, where are you?

1620
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:14,831
Venice!

1621
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:17,042
Venice!

1622
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:18,835
Where'd you go?

1623
01:12:22,923 --> 01:12:25,675
Oh, baby.
Oh, you're gonna play rough, huh?

1624
01:12:25,759 --> 01:12:27,928
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- You like that?

1625
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,390
I like it. I like it.

1626
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:34,267
Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie, Wolfie.

1627
01:12:34,351 --> 01:12:35,477
Wolfie?

1628
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,853
Yeah, it's my safe word, baby.
It's my safe word.

1629
01:12:36,937 --> 01:12:38,355
I don't give a fuck about your safe word!

1630
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:40,524
- Come on!
- Shut the fuck up!

1631
01:12:40,607 --> 01:12:42,984
Shut up, you little bitch!

1632
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:45,570
You're a fucking dirty little birdy!

1633
01:12:47,489 --> 01:12:48,657
That's right.

1634
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:50,033
That's right! I forgot.

1635
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:51,618
I forgot, baby.

1636
01:12:51,743 --> 01:12:56,039
Donnie and I were investing
in a condominium complex in Venice.

1637
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:57,249
That's why all this confusion.

1638
01:12:57,332 --> 01:12:58,875
Oh, you're investing in Italy?

1639
01:12:58,959 --> 01:13:00,669
Not Italy. California.

1640
01:13:00,752 --> 01:13:02,254
- Oh, California?
- Yeah.

1641
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:03,463
You're a lying piece of shit!

1642
01:13:03,547 --> 01:13:04,714
Duchess, baby, come on.

1643
01:13:04,798 --> 01:13:06,341
Don't you fucking "Duchess" me.

1644
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:07,884
Don't you "Duchess" me!

1645
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:11,096
Do you really think that
I don't know what you're up to?

1646
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:13,098
- You're a father now, Jordan.
- Yeah.

1647
01:13:13,181 --> 01:13:14,599
- You're a father now.
- I know...

1648
01:13:14,683 --> 01:13:16,393
And you're still acting like an infant!

1649
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:19,354
God damn it!

1650
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:22,107
Baby, you know,
you got real anger issues.

1651
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:24,526
Who is the one who flew in here

1652
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:27,487
at 3:00 in the morning
on their stupid helicopter

1653
01:13:27,571 --> 01:13:29,614
and woke up Skylar? That was you!

1654
01:13:29,698 --> 01:13:32,325
Oh, Skylar! Oh, fucking bullshit!

1655
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:47,132
Does it even matter to you
that I just had that driving range

1656
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:50,427
sodded with Bermuda grass, Jordan,

1657
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:52,554
- and now you fucking wrecked it!
- Oh, my God... Bermuda grass.

1658
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,389
No, you didn't research the whole thing

1659
01:13:54,472 --> 01:13:56,558
and deal with the fucking
golf course people!

1660
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:57,809
Oh, my God,

1661
01:13:57,892 --> 01:14:00,437
you had to deal
with the golf course people, too!

1662
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,189
What a Greek tragedy, honey!
Oh, my God!

1663
01:14:03,315 --> 01:14:06,192
You probably had to pay them
in cash with your hands!

1664
01:14:06,276 --> 01:14:07,485
What a fucking burden.

1665
01:14:07,569 --> 01:14:09,529
And actually do some work
besides swiping

1666
01:14:09,613 --> 01:14:11,740
my fucking credit card all day, huh?

1667
01:14:11,823 --> 01:14:14,534
Because I can't keep track
of your professions, honey.

1668
01:14:14,618 --> 01:14:16,494
'Cause last month
you were a wine connoisseur.

1669
01:14:16,578 --> 01:14:18,622
Now you're an aspiring
landscape architect!

1670
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:20,373
- Let me get that right... No!
- Fuck you!

1671
01:14:20,457 --> 01:14:22,459
Don't fucking dare throw that

1672
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:25,003
fucking water at me.
Don't you fucking dare.

1673
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,380
All right, honey?

1674
01:14:27,756 --> 01:14:28,965
Now will you just...

1675
01:14:29,049 --> 01:14:30,925
We could talk this out, all right?

1676
01:14:31,009 --> 01:14:33,386
We just use our words. You know?

1677
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:34,554
Communicate.

1678
01:14:34,638 --> 01:14:35,847
Okay?

1679
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,682
Come on, sweetheart.

1680
01:14:37,891 --> 01:14:39,726
Talk to me. Talk to me.

1681
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:41,895
Stop flexing your muscles, Jordan.

1682
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:43,688
You look like a fucking imbecile.

1683
01:14:43,772 --> 01:14:45,065
Babe, come on.

1684
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:48,318
You should feel happy
you got a husband

1685
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:50,654
who's in such great shape
like this, huh?

1686
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:52,697
Come here.

1687
01:14:52,781 --> 01:14:54,324
Come on, give me a kiss.

1688
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:55,450
You look so beautiful right now.

1689
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:56,660
- Come on.
- Kiss you?

1690
01:14:56,743 --> 01:14:57,911
- You look so beautiful...
- Kiss you?

1691
01:14:57,994 --> 01:14:59,621
Yeah, give me one...

1692
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:01,915
Fuck you!

1693
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:04,000
<i>Ah, yes, my morning ritual.</i>

1694
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:06,461
<i>First I'd get up and fight with Naomi</i>

1695
01:15:06,544 --> 01:15:08,755
<i>about whatever it is
I did the night before.</i>

1696
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:11,049
<i>Next was a steam so I could sweat out</i>

1697
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:12,884
<i>the drugs still in my system.</i>

1698
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:14,594
<i>Then I'd assess the damage.</i>

1699
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,596
<i>Drown out my eyeballs.</i>

1700
01:15:16,763 --> 01:15:19,224
<i>Take my "back pills"
to get the day started,</i>

1701
01:15:19,307 --> 01:15:21,393
<i>then seek to make up with Naomi.</i>

1702
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:23,436
Good morning, Daddy.

1703
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,605
Where's my kiss?

1704
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:29,067
Hey, sweetheart.

1705
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,822
Does Daddy get a kiss from
both of his little girls, huh?

1706
01:15:33,947 --> 01:15:35,281
Oh, no.

1707
01:15:35,365 --> 01:15:38,451
No, Daddy doesn't even
get to touch Mommy

1708
01:15:38,535 --> 01:15:40,286
for a very, very,

1709
01:15:40,787 --> 01:15:42,122
very long time.

1710
01:15:42,664 --> 01:15:45,417
Daddy's really sorry
about what he said in the other room.

1711
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:46,710
He didn't mean any of it.

1712
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:49,087
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.

1713
01:15:49,629 --> 01:15:51,214
And from now on,

1714
01:15:52,632 --> 01:15:54,801
it's gonna be nothing but short,

1715
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:57,220
short skirts around the house.

1716
01:15:59,848 --> 01:16:02,308
And you know something else, Daddy?

1717
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:09,399
Mommy is just so sick
and tired of wearing panties.

1718
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:13,153
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1719
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:16,948
In fact,

1720
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:21,703
she's decided to throw them

1721
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:24,998
all away.

1722
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:32,672
So take a good look, Daddy.

1723
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:36,134
You're gonna be seeing
an awful lot of this around the house.

1724
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:37,761
Oh, baby...

1725
01:16:37,844 --> 01:16:39,304
Yeah, Mommy.

1726
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:41,723
- Yeah...
- But no touching.

1727
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:43,892
Oh, gosh.

1728
01:16:48,396 --> 01:16:50,106
What's wrong, Daddy?

1729
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:51,524
Baby.

1730
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:54,861
God!

1731
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:57,697
Look at this shit.

1732
01:16:57,822 --> 01:17:01,534
Okay. Mommy likes to
play games with Daddy.

1733
01:17:03,328 --> 01:17:07,874
Mommy, have you ever noticed
anything odd about Mr...

1734
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:09,918
Mr. Fuzzy Bear over there?

1735
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:15,215
His eyes seem
to be a little bit odd, don't they?

1736
01:17:15,715 --> 01:17:19,177
Yeah, there's something
a little bit different about his eyes.

1737
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:22,472
Yes! I think it's true. Say "Hi," Mommy.

1738
01:17:22,555 --> 01:17:24,390
Say "Hi" to Rocco and Rocco.

1739
01:17:24,474 --> 01:17:25,809
<i>Say "Hi. " Hi, fellas.</i>

1740
01:17:25,934 --> 01:17:27,310
See that, huh?

1741
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:29,145
<i>Of all the fucking days,</i>

1742
01:17:29,229 --> 01:17:30,980
<i>she chooses today
to give me blue balls!</i>

1743
01:17:31,523 --> 01:17:34,150
<i>I mean, today was
the biggest day in Stratton's history,</i>

1744
01:17:34,234 --> 01:17:36,069
<i>and I needed to be thinking straight.</i>

1745
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:37,570
Hey, Jordan!

1746
01:17:37,904 --> 01:17:39,739
- Welcome.
- Steve here yet?

1747
01:17:39,823 --> 01:17:42,951
<i>This was the day that
we launched the Steve Madden IPO.</i>

1748
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:45,161
Troops are all here,
everyone's all rallied, excited.

1749
01:17:45,245 --> 01:17:47,038
<i>Everything had to run tight.</i>

1750
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:48,164
<i>It had to be perfect.</i>

1751
01:17:48,248 --> 01:17:50,416
What the fuck is that kid doing?

1752
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,085
What's he doing?

1753
01:17:52,794 --> 01:17:54,671
The biggest IPO in this firm's history.

1754
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:57,048
What the fuck is he doing?

1755
01:17:58,091 --> 01:18:00,051
Is he... Is he wearing a bow tie?

1756
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:01,427
Hi.

1757
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:03,680
How're you doing?

1758
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:04,764
Good.

1759
01:18:05,682 --> 01:18:07,475
You cleaning the fish bowl?

1760
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,645
I just... I had a minute and...

1761
01:18:11,062 --> 01:18:12,438
You had a minute.

1762
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:15,066
And today you needed
to clean the fish bowl? Today?

1763
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:18,820
I had finished my paperwork
and I had a couple of minutes.

1764
01:18:18,987 --> 01:18:20,780
Okay. Nice to meet you.

1765
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:28,037
On new issue day?

1766
01:18:29,706 --> 01:18:32,292
On cock sucking,
motherfucking new issue day?

1767
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:33,585
This is what you do?

1768
01:18:34,127 --> 01:18:36,546
Hey, everybody, listen up!

1769
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:39,799
This is what happens when you fuck
with your pets on new issue day!

1770
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:55,315
Take your little bow tie, get your shit,

1771
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:57,483
and get the fuck out of my office!
You understand?

1772
01:18:57,567 --> 01:18:59,068
Get the fuck out!

1773
01:19:02,739 --> 01:19:04,240
Everybody on point!

1774
01:19:04,324 --> 01:19:07,243
We are here to make money.
Everybody on point.

1775
01:19:09,746 --> 01:19:12,498
<i>A real wolf pit,
which is exactly how I liked it.</i>

1776
01:19:12,582 --> 01:19:15,209
Jordan, look what I caught in the lobby.
I caught a genius.

1777
01:19:15,335 --> 01:19:16,753
<i>Enter Steve Madden.</i>

1778
01:19:16,878 --> 01:19:17,962
The great American cobbler.

1779
01:19:18,046 --> 01:19:20,423
<i>Red-hot ladies footwear impresario.</i>

1780
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:24,093
<i>And thanks to Donnie,
we were taking his company public.</i>

1781
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:27,889
<i>Stratton Oakmont was crawling out
of the primordial ooze.</i>

1782
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:29,974
<i>Pond scum no more.</i>

1783
01:19:30,308 --> 01:19:31,601
That's why they gotta see your face.

1784
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:34,145
You get them fired up so they push
the shit out of this stock. Okay?

1785
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:36,814
<i>And not only that,
Donnie and I secretly owned</i>

1786
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:39,192
<i>85% of Steve Madden Shoes,</i>

1787
01:19:39,776 --> 01:19:41,778
<i>which legally speaking was a big no-no,</i>

1788
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:45,239
<i>but we'd get filthy fucking rich
if our troops got behind it.</i>

1789
01:19:45,573 --> 01:19:47,825
<i>Our job was to get them worked up.</i>

1790
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:49,702
<i>But not too worked up.</i>

1791
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,497
Hello. If...

1792
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:55,708
For those of you who don't know me...

1793
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,043
My name's Steve Madden.

1794
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:58,670
Yeah, we know who you are.

1795
01:19:58,962 --> 01:20:00,254
Your name is on the box.

1796
01:20:00,463 --> 01:20:02,006
Get the shoes. Show them the shoes.

1797
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:03,675
- Show them the shoes.
- Okay. Yeah.

1798
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:06,970
Anyway, you know,
this shoe is pretty cool.

1799
01:20:07,053 --> 01:20:09,889
This is the Mary Lou, which is really
the shoe that put me on the map.

1800
01:20:09,973 --> 01:20:11,557
Without it, I wouldn't be here.

1801
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:12,809
It's a fat girls' shoe!

1802
01:20:12,892 --> 01:20:14,852
Believe it or not...
Believe it or not though,

1803
01:20:14,978 --> 01:20:18,272
the Mary Lou is actually the same
as the Mary Jane, but it's black leather.

1804
01:20:22,986 --> 01:20:24,612
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1805
01:20:24,696 --> 01:20:27,573
Fight back! Come on!
Where you at? Where you at?

1806
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:29,158
All right!

1807
01:20:29,242 --> 01:20:32,495
Let's give it up for Steve Madden
and his awesome Mary Lou!

1808
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:34,747
Hold that up. Hold that up.
Hold that up proud!

1809
01:20:35,081 --> 01:20:37,291
Give him a round of applause!

1810
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:40,628
You guys got that
out of your systems, huh?

1811
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:43,589
You having a good afternoon or what?

1812
01:20:44,132 --> 01:20:47,176
I wanna take a moment
and tell you why Steve here is so

1813
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:49,554
absolutely off the fucking wall.

1814
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:54,350
It's because this man
is a creative genius.

1815
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:58,438
This ability, this gift that Steve has,

1816
01:20:58,563 --> 01:21:01,858
it goes beyond just
spotting the hottest shoe trends.

1817
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:05,695
Steve's power is that he creates trends.

1818
01:21:06,029 --> 01:21:07,447
You understand?

1819
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:09,741
Artists like Steve
come along once every decade.

1820
01:21:09,824 --> 01:21:13,244
I'm talking Giorgio Armani,
Gianni Versace, Coco Chanel,

1821
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:14,954
Yves Saint Laurent.

1822
01:21:15,413 --> 01:21:17,040
Steve, come over here for a second.

1823
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:19,292
I don't think you all realize

1824
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:21,335
that Steve Madden

1825
01:21:21,669 --> 01:21:24,964
is the hottest person
in the women's shoe industry,

1826
01:21:25,048 --> 01:21:26,340
with orders going through the roof

1827
01:21:26,424 --> 01:21:29,761
at every department store
in North America right now.

1828
01:21:30,261 --> 01:21:32,263
We have him here in our office!

1829
01:21:33,306 --> 01:21:36,100
We should thank
our fucking lucky stars this man is here!

1830
01:21:36,184 --> 01:21:38,770
We should be on our hands
and knees right now,

1831
01:21:38,853 --> 01:21:40,938
getting ready to suck this guy off!

1832
01:21:41,022 --> 01:21:43,566
Like this! Okay?

1833
01:21:43,816 --> 01:21:45,443
I wanna suck you off, Steve!

1834
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:47,904
Everyone's gonna suck you off!

1835
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:49,781
This is our golden ticket

1836
01:21:49,989 --> 01:21:52,283
to the fucking chocolate
factory right here!

1837
01:21:53,201 --> 01:21:54,327
And I wanna meet

1838
01:21:54,494 --> 01:21:56,662
Willy fucking Wonka, okay?

1839
01:21:57,330 --> 01:22:00,166
I wanna be with the fucking
Oompa Loompas like this!

1840
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:06,672
All right, get off this fucking stage!
Get out of here.

1841
01:22:07,215 --> 01:22:09,550
All right, I want all of you
to focus for a second.

1842
01:22:10,093 --> 01:22:12,095
See those little black boxes?

1843
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:13,429
They're called telephones.

1844
01:22:13,513 --> 01:22:16,265
I'm gonna let you in on a little
secret about these telephones.

1845
01:22:16,349 --> 01:22:18,935
They're not gonna dial
themselves. Okay?

1846
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:22,772
Without you, they're just
worthless hunks of plastic.

1847
01:22:23,397 --> 01:22:26,984
Like a loaded M16 without
a trained Marine to pull the trigger.

1848
01:22:28,027 --> 01:22:30,446
And in the case of the telephone,

1849
01:22:30,613 --> 01:22:33,241
it's up to each and every one of you,

1850
01:22:34,742 --> 01:22:36,828
my highly-trained Strattonites.

1851
01:22:37,954 --> 01:22:39,247
My killers!

1852
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:43,292
My killers, who will not
take no for an answer!

1853
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:45,753
My fucking warriors,

1854
01:22:46,212 --> 01:22:48,214
who will not hang up the phone

1855
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:51,300
until their client either buys

1856
01:22:51,384 --> 01:22:53,553
or fucking dies!

1857
01:23:08,568 --> 01:23:10,111
Let me tell you something.

1858
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:13,197
There is no nobility in poverty.

1859
01:23:13,656 --> 01:23:16,659
I have been a rich man
and I have been a poor man.

1860
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:19,162
And I choose rich every fucking time.

1861
01:23:20,413 --> 01:23:23,082
Because at least as a rich man,
when I have to face my problems,

1862
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:27,003
I show up in the back of a limo,
wearing a $2,000 suit

1863
01:23:27,086 --> 01:23:29,672
and a $40,000 gold fucking watch!

1864
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:35,011
Duke it out! Hit him!

1865
01:23:35,094 --> 01:23:36,512
Get the fuck off me!

1866
01:23:37,972 --> 01:23:42,143
And if anyone here thinks
I'm superficial or materialistic,

1867
01:23:42,268 --> 01:23:44,520
go get a job at fucking McDonald's,

1868
01:23:44,604 --> 01:23:46,606
'cause that's where you fucking belong!

1869
01:23:48,733 --> 01:23:52,278
But before you depart
this room full of winners,

1870
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:56,157
I want you to take a good look
at the person next to you. Go on.

1871
01:23:57,158 --> 01:23:59,410
Because sometime in
the not-so-distant future,

1872
01:23:59,827 --> 01:24:03,289
you're gonna be pulling up to a red light
in your beat-up old fucking Pinto,

1873
01:24:03,623 --> 01:24:06,667
and that person's gonna be
pulling up right alongside you

1874
01:24:06,751 --> 01:24:08,878
in their brand new Porsche

1875
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:11,714
with their beautiful wife by their side,

1876
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:13,799
who's got big voluptuous tits.

1877
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:17,720
And who're you gonna be sitting next to?

1878
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:21,098
Some disgusting wildebeest
with three days of razor-stubble,

1879
01:24:21,182 --> 01:24:22,516
in a sleeveless muumuu,

1880
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,977
crammed in next to you
in a carload full of groceries

1881
01:24:25,061 --> 01:24:26,812
from the fucking Price Club!

1882
01:24:26,896 --> 01:24:29,190
That's who you're gonna
be sitting next to!

1883
01:24:29,273 --> 01:24:31,525
So you listen to me and you listen well.

1884
01:24:31,651 --> 01:24:33,861
Are you behind on your credit card bills?

1885
01:24:34,278 --> 01:24:36,447
Good! Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

1886
01:24:36,864 --> 01:24:39,408
Is your landlord ready
to evict you? Good!

1887
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,869
Pick up the phone and start dialing!

1888
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:45,248
Does your girlfriend think
you're a fucking worthless loser?

1889
01:24:45,331 --> 01:24:48,376
Good! Pick up the phone
and start dialing!

1890
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:52,004
I want you to deal with your problems
by becoming rich!

1891
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:57,468
All you have to do today
is pick up that phone

1892
01:24:58,678 --> 01:25:01,514
and speak the words
that I have taught you.

1893
01:25:01,806 --> 01:25:03,766
And I will make you richer

1894
01:25:03,891 --> 01:25:06,936
than the most powerful CEO
in the United States of fucking America!

1895
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:08,187
Yeah!

1896
01:25:09,355 --> 01:25:10,606
Fuck, yeah!

1897
01:25:11,232 --> 01:25:13,317
I want you to go out there

1898
01:25:14,068 --> 01:25:15,861
and I want you to ram

1899
01:25:16,195 --> 01:25:19,448
Steve Madden stock
down your clients' throats

1900
01:25:19,532 --> 01:25:21,826
until they fucking choke on it!

1901
01:25:22,243 --> 01:25:26,497
Till they choke on it and they buy
100,000 shares! That's what I want.

1902
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:28,124
Yeah! Fuck, yeah.

1903
01:25:28,207 --> 01:25:29,834
You be ferocious!

1904
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:31,877
- You be relentless!
- Yeah!

1905
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:35,256
You be telephone fucking terrorists!

1906
01:25:36,716 --> 01:25:40,303
Now let's knock this motherfucker
out of the park!

1907
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:15,338
<i>At 1:</i><i>00 p.m., we opened
the stock for sale at $4.50 a share.</i>

1908
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:18,549
<i>By 1:</i><i>03, it was over $18.</i>

1909
01:26:18,674 --> 01:26:20,968
<i>Even the big Wall Street
firms were buying.</i>

1910
01:26:30,895 --> 01:26:32,813
Of the two million shares
offered for sale,

1911
01:26:32,897 --> 01:26:35,858
a million belonged to me,
held in phony accounts by my rat holes.

1912
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:38,110
Now once the price hit the high teens...

1913
01:26:38,277 --> 01:26:40,404
You know what? Who gives a shit?

1914
01:26:40,488 --> 01:26:42,448
As always, the point is this.

1915
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:46,952
$22 million in three fucking hours!

1916
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,955
Can you believe this shit?

1917
01:26:50,247 --> 01:26:52,458
- I fucking love this, baby!
- It's amazing!

1918
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:53,959
Jordan!

1919
01:26:54,085 --> 01:26:55,378
Barry Kleinman's on the phone

1920
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:57,088
- from Future Video.
- Who?

1921
01:26:57,171 --> 01:26:58,381
I don't know. He shot at your wedding.

1922
01:26:58,464 --> 01:26:59,507
He says it's urgent.

1923
01:26:59,632 --> 01:27:01,717
Urgent? Who the fuck
is Barry Kleinman?

1924
01:27:01,801 --> 01:27:03,386
Oh, my God, you wanna marry me?

1925
01:27:03,469 --> 01:27:04,512
You're in love with me?

1926
01:27:04,595 --> 01:27:05,638
Yeah. Go fuck your cousin!

1927
01:27:05,763 --> 01:27:06,764
Hey, Barry, what's up?

1928
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:08,974
Listen, I got this subpoena.

1929
01:27:09,058 --> 01:27:10,518
<i>Subpoena? What the fuck
are you talking about?</i>

1930
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:13,229
Yeah, the FBI, they want
a copy of your wedding video.

1931
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:14,480
<i>The fucking FBI?</i>

1932
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,524
- You fucking kidding me?
- <i>Listen to me.</i>

1933
01:27:16,607 --> 01:27:17,900
<i>His name is Denham.</i>

1934
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,652
<i>He's an agent with the New York office.</i>

1935
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:20,778
<i>What's his problem?</i>

1936
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:23,489
<i>He's a Boy Scout.
He thinks you're fucking Gordon Gekko.</i>

1937
01:27:24,782 --> 01:27:26,033
What does he want
with my wedding video?

1938
01:27:26,117 --> 01:27:27,743
It's like an invasion of my privacy.

1939
01:27:27,827 --> 01:27:29,161
You know what I'm saying? It's like...

1940
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:30,579
It's intrusive, you know.

1941
01:27:30,663 --> 01:27:33,332
He's got pictures of your
whole inner fucking circle.

1942
01:27:33,416 --> 01:27:35,251
Pictures, names of the people.

1943
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:36,335
You know what he's trying to do?

1944
01:27:36,419 --> 01:27:37,545
Exactly what he's doing.
Look at yourself.

1945
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:38,838
He's trying to rattle you,

1946
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:40,423
he's trying to rattle your old lady,

1947
01:27:40,506 --> 01:27:43,217
so she nags you until
you become a fucking witness.

1948
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:44,760
He wants me to rat on myself?

1949
01:27:44,844 --> 01:27:46,637
He wants me to
give information about my...

1950
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:48,556
Listen. The good fucking news is,

1951
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:50,433
you know I know everybody downtown,

1952
01:27:50,516 --> 01:27:52,726
I call up the Justice Department,
the DEA,

1953
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:55,896
nobody even knows you fucking exist,
so calm down!

1954
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:57,398
They don't know I exist?

1955
01:27:57,690 --> 01:27:59,316
- No.
- That's good.

1956
01:28:04,321 --> 01:28:05,364
But you...

1957
01:28:05,448 --> 01:28:06,907
You know who he is, right?

1958
01:28:07,658 --> 01:28:09,618
- Yeah.
- So, if I just wanted to get

1959
01:28:09,702 --> 01:28:11,662
some more information,
just find out what he knows,

1960
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:14,957
you could go to his house, right?

1961
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,917
Tap his phones a little bit, bug him.

1962
01:28:17,001 --> 01:28:18,127
You could get some information...

1963
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:21,005
You don't fuck with these guys like that.

1964
01:28:21,088 --> 01:28:22,173
You don't fuck with them like that.

1965
01:28:22,256 --> 01:28:23,424
What are you, nuts or something?

1966
01:28:23,507 --> 01:28:25,134
This is what you fucking do.
What do I pay you for?

1967
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:28,304
I have a fucking P.I. license, you know?
I make a living at this.

1968
01:28:28,387 --> 01:28:29,472
I'm not a cop anymore.

1969
01:28:29,555 --> 01:28:31,557
They'll take my fucking license
away from me, all right?

1970
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:32,725
Okay.

1971
01:28:33,434 --> 01:28:35,686
Okay, if I can't do that, can I just...

1972
01:28:35,978 --> 01:28:37,229
Can I give the guy a call?

1973
01:28:38,439 --> 01:28:40,441
- Why? Is that...
- Jordan. Jordan.

1974
01:28:40,524 --> 01:28:41,525
Do me a favor?

1975
01:28:41,609 --> 01:28:44,528
The only one who calls this guy
is your fucking lawyer.

1976
01:28:44,612 --> 01:28:45,613
I can't call him, right?

1977
01:28:45,696 --> 01:28:47,448
- It's against the rules?
- I told you,

1978
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:49,200
whatever the fuck you say to him,

1979
01:28:49,283 --> 01:28:51,911
he's gonna use against you.
Don't you understand?

1980
01:28:51,994 --> 01:28:53,746
He's smart, you're dumb.

1981
01:28:53,829 --> 01:28:55,080
Fucking bullshit.

1982
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:58,167
Are we fucking talking tonight,
or are you gonna get schwacked?

1983
01:28:58,250 --> 01:28:59,793
The last time you
took these fucking pills,

1984
01:28:59,919 --> 01:29:01,879
you put your head in the
fucking macaroni. I had to pick it up.

1985
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:04,423
All right.

1986
01:29:04,507 --> 01:29:06,050
Okay, I won't call him.

1987
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:12,890
Hey, fellas! Come on board.
The plank's right around there.

1988
01:29:13,766 --> 01:29:15,142
Welcome!

1989
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:17,937
What a nice day.

1990
01:29:19,188 --> 01:29:20,272
Hey.

1991
01:29:20,731 --> 01:29:22,274
Welcome aboard.

1992
01:29:22,775 --> 01:29:25,402
Jordan. Welcome aboard the <i>Naomi.</i>
Pleasure to meet you.

1993
01:29:25,486 --> 01:29:27,071
Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes.

1994
01:29:27,154 --> 01:29:28,197
Hi, how are you?

1995
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:31,534
Let me introduce you. This is Nicole,
Heidi. Come on. Don't be shy.

1996
01:29:31,617 --> 01:29:34,119
What are you guys all shy for?
Don't be scared.

1997
01:29:34,203 --> 01:29:35,371
These are friends of Stratton.

1998
01:29:35,454 --> 01:29:36,956
- It's a pleasure.
- Hello.

1999
01:29:39,625 --> 01:29:43,087
Your message said that
you wanted to speak privately.

2000
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:44,964
Right. I do want to speak privately.

2001
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,382
Give us a minute, huh, ladies?

2002
01:29:46,465 --> 01:29:48,050
Let me know if I can get you anything.

2003
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:49,969
We'd be happy to help.

2004
01:29:50,177 --> 01:29:51,220
You guys hungry?

2005
01:29:51,303 --> 01:29:54,098
Want something to eat?
Got some pasta, shrimp, lobster.

2006
01:29:54,181 --> 01:29:56,559
I got whiskey.
Any kind of booze you want.

2007
01:29:56,642 --> 01:29:58,102
You know what?
The Bureau doesn't allow us

2008
01:29:58,185 --> 01:29:59,603
to drink while we're at sea.

2009
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:02,231
Duh! Of course.

2010
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:04,149
Ever been on one of these before?

2011
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:05,568
A boat?

2012
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:07,611
I learned how to sail when I was six.

2013
01:30:07,695 --> 01:30:09,780
No shit. Is that right? Really?

2014
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:11,574
On one like this, though?

2015
01:30:11,657 --> 01:30:14,451
I had the whole front extended in order
to fit the chopper up there.

2016
01:30:14,577 --> 01:30:15,869
See that?

2017
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:18,622
Anyway, this is for you.

2018
01:30:18,706 --> 01:30:21,542
It's a complete list of every person
that was at my wedding.

2019
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:24,378
I understand you wanted
the whole wedding video.

2020
01:30:24,461 --> 01:30:27,214
Figured this would help expedite
the whole process, right?

2021
01:30:27,298 --> 01:30:29,049
- There you go.
- Look,

2022
01:30:29,133 --> 01:30:32,052
my point is that
I know you're investigating Stratton.

2023
01:30:32,136 --> 01:30:35,639
But for the life of me,
I can't figure out why.

2024
01:30:36,015 --> 01:30:37,391
I know we're a little unorthodox,

2025
01:30:37,474 --> 01:30:39,184
we're a little loud in
the way we do things.

2026
01:30:39,268 --> 01:30:40,394
But you gotta understand,

2027
01:30:40,477 --> 01:30:41,937
we're the new guys
on the block, you know,

2028
01:30:42,021 --> 01:30:44,148
we're trying to make
a name for ourselves.

2029
01:30:44,231 --> 01:30:48,861
But I want you to understand,
we don't do anything illegal.

2030
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:50,738
Whatsoever.

2031
01:30:50,821 --> 01:30:52,364
I mean, you could talk to the SEC.

2032
01:30:52,448 --> 01:30:55,492
They were at my office 15 times
over the last six months.

2033
01:30:55,576 --> 01:30:58,203
I mean, I got... I got nothing to hide.

2034
01:30:58,287 --> 01:31:01,040
Well, you know the SEC
is a civil regulatory agency.

2035
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:02,666
We pursue criminal activities.

2036
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:05,586
Exactly! You go after real criminals,

2037
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:09,214
which makes me wonder what
the hell you're investigating me for?

2038
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:10,674
I mean, honestly...

2039
01:31:10,758 --> 01:31:14,595
What is it that you think
that we did or do? I don't get it.

2040
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:15,971
Well, I...

2041
01:31:16,055 --> 01:31:18,474
Look, Jordan, I can't discuss
an ongoing investigation.

2042
01:31:18,557 --> 01:31:20,225
No, I get that. No, I understand.

2043
01:31:20,351 --> 01:31:21,727
With that said...

2044
01:31:22,603 --> 01:31:24,438
This case got dumped on my desk...

2045
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:26,357
- Did it?
- You know, by a higher-up

2046
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:29,652
who needs to make a show of looking
into the new company on the block,

2047
01:31:29,735 --> 01:31:31,195
- with all the press and everything.
- New loud guys.

2048
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:34,865
And then I end up being the schmuck
who does the looking. Exactly.

2049
01:31:34,948 --> 01:31:36,867
It's just, you know... It bothers me.

2050
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:39,495
We're the new guy. We're the one
that's banging on Wall Street's door.

2051
01:31:39,578 --> 01:31:40,663
I mean, you should...

2052
01:31:40,746 --> 01:31:42,665
You should see what's going on
at the bigger firms.

2053
01:31:42,748 --> 01:31:44,208
I mean, I know all the information.

2054
01:31:44,375 --> 01:31:47,169
It's true! Goldman,
Lehman Brothers, Merrill...

2055
01:31:47,252 --> 01:31:49,254
Collateralized debt obligations?

2056
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:50,631
This Internet stock bullshit?

2057
01:31:50,714 --> 01:31:52,508
I mean, it's a fucking travesty.

2058
01:31:52,591 --> 01:31:57,596
I could take you step-by-step
through what exactly is occurring.

2059
01:31:57,846 --> 01:31:59,431
All you have to do is ask.

2060
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:00,891
I'm available.

2061
01:32:01,058 --> 01:32:02,434
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

2062
01:32:02,518 --> 01:32:05,396
I don't see why a little sit down like this

2063
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:07,815
can't be profitable for the both of us.

2064
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:10,192
It should. Right?
It should profit the both of us.

2065
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:11,777
- It should.
- Look.

2066
01:32:12,319 --> 01:32:14,530
I'm gonna give you my personal line.

2067
01:32:14,613 --> 01:32:17,533
Five days a week,
you just call me, feel free.

2068
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:19,451
- I'll do that.
- Great.

2069
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:23,706
Are you sure you guys
don't want something to drink?

2070
01:32:23,789 --> 01:32:25,457
You're not hungry? Nothing?

2071
01:32:25,541 --> 01:32:27,167
- Nothing? No?
- Oh, no.

2072
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:32,881
Let me ask you,
and if you don't wanna get too personal,

2073
01:32:32,965 --> 01:32:35,259
just tell me to shut up at any time.

2074
01:32:36,135 --> 01:32:38,762
Did you try to get your
broker's license at one time?

2075
01:32:38,846 --> 01:32:41,682
Did I hear that right? Were you trying
to take a stab at Wall Street?

2076
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:44,518
- No?
- Who you been talking to?

2077
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:45,602
Who the fuck you been talking to?

2078
01:32:45,686 --> 01:32:48,439
Well, you're investigating me.
I hear things.

2079
01:32:48,522 --> 01:32:50,607
You know what I mean?

2080
01:32:50,691 --> 01:32:52,276
You ever think about
what would've happened

2081
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:54,820
if you would have stayed the course?

2082
01:32:56,238 --> 01:32:58,073
You know what?
When I'm riding home on the subway

2083
01:32:58,157 --> 01:32:59,408
and my balls are fucking sweating,

2084
01:32:59,491 --> 01:33:01,285
I'm wearing the same suit
three days in a row...

2085
01:33:01,368 --> 01:33:02,870
Yeah, you bet I do.

2086
01:33:02,953 --> 01:33:04,621
I've thought about it before.
Who wouldn't, right?

2087
01:33:04,705 --> 01:33:05,748
Right, who fucking wouldn't?

2088
01:33:05,831 --> 01:33:06,999
What do you get...

2089
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:08,333
Another personal question,
no need to answer...

2090
01:33:08,417 --> 01:33:09,793
No, that's all right, Jordan.

2091
01:33:09,877 --> 01:33:12,921
What do you pull in? 50, 60K?
Something like that?

2092
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:15,048
A year? In the ballpark?

2093
01:33:15,132 --> 01:33:16,592
Well, I...

2094
01:33:16,675 --> 01:33:18,469
Let's put it this way.

2095
01:33:18,552 --> 01:33:21,346
You get a free handgun
when you sign up for the Bureau.

2096
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:24,224
No, but it fucking pisses me off.
You know what I mean?

2097
01:33:24,308 --> 01:33:26,477
You think about the people
that built this country,

2098
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:27,978
hardworking people like you.

2099
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:30,606
Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents.

2100
01:33:30,731 --> 01:33:34,401
End of the day, you guys get
fucking skinned alive financially.

2101
01:33:34,485 --> 01:33:36,361
It fucking makes me angry.

2102
01:33:36,445 --> 01:33:39,531
Now the one thing about
Wall Street and this market is,

2103
01:33:39,615 --> 01:33:41,283
for me, I feel

2104
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:44,703
it's good to give back.
You know, there's...

2105
01:33:44,787 --> 01:33:46,955
There are situations where I can

2106
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:50,584
make those situations better for people.
You know?

2107
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:51,960
You know what I mean.

2108
01:33:52,044 --> 01:33:53,462
Opportunity

2109
01:33:53,754 --> 01:33:55,005
is everything.

2110
01:33:55,088 --> 01:33:56,340
Exactly.

2111
01:33:56,465 --> 01:33:58,926
Take for example,
I got this one kid, right?

2112
01:33:59,009 --> 01:34:02,805
Went to school for environmental
science, something like that.

2113
01:34:02,888 --> 01:34:04,681
He was bogged down by student loans.

2114
01:34:04,765 --> 01:34:07,476
Turns out, his mother
needed triple bypass surgery.

2115
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:08,977
- Jesus.
- Right. Horrible situation.

2116
01:34:09,061 --> 01:34:10,020
Sure.

2117
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:11,188
But we got him into the market

2118
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:12,981
at the right time
and chose the right stock.

2119
01:34:13,065 --> 01:34:14,817
We gave him the right guidance.

2120
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:18,070
Boom! Overnight,
changed his entire life.

2121
01:34:18,195 --> 01:34:21,532
Got to put his mother into
the best hospital in New York City.

2122
01:34:21,615 --> 01:34:24,493
It didn't work out for her, granted,
she passed away, unfortunately.

2123
01:34:24,576 --> 01:34:26,495
But we gave him that opportunity.

2124
01:34:26,578 --> 01:34:27,746
You know what I'm saying?

2125
01:34:28,455 --> 01:34:32,960
It's just about setting up the right team,
and then overnight your life can change.

2126
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:40,759
What does... What does an intern...

2127
01:34:42,302 --> 01:34:44,179
What does an intern
make in a deal like that?

2128
01:34:44,263 --> 01:34:46,306
Well, in that situation,

2129
01:34:47,224 --> 01:34:50,269
in that particular trade,
and it was one trade,

2130
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:53,105
north of half a million dollars.

2131
01:34:56,733 --> 01:34:58,986
And I'd do that for anybody, you know,

2132
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:01,738
anybody that needs
the proper guidance.

2133
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:25,637
Can you say that again,
just the way you said it?

2134
01:35:26,054 --> 01:35:27,764
Just the same way.

2135
01:35:31,977 --> 01:35:33,061
I don't know what you're talking about.

2136
01:35:33,145 --> 01:35:35,397
Oh, come on! You know
what I'm talking about.

2137
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,482
I think what Jordan just did is he...

2138
01:35:37,566 --> 01:35:38,692
- If I'm not mistaken...
- No.

2139
01:35:38,775 --> 01:35:40,903
...you just tried to bribe a federal officer.

2140
01:35:40,986 --> 01:35:43,071
No, technically I didn't bribe anybody.

2141
01:35:43,155 --> 01:35:45,574
No, no, that's not
the conversation I heard, Jordan.

2142
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:47,159
No, no, according
to the U.S. criminal code,

2143
01:35:47,242 --> 01:35:50,662
there needs to be an exact dollar figure
for the exchange of services.

2144
01:35:50,746 --> 01:35:52,372
That would not hold up in a court of law.

2145
01:35:52,456 --> 01:35:54,124
Nah, it's not how I heard it.

2146
01:35:54,207 --> 01:35:56,919
No, no, no, that's the truth.
But I want to tell you this.

2147
01:35:57,002 --> 01:35:58,003
Yeah.

2148
01:35:58,086 --> 01:35:59,588
The same gentleman that told me

2149
01:35:59,671 --> 01:36:01,423
that you tried to get
your broker's license

2150
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:03,634
also told me that
you are a straight arrow.

2151
01:36:03,759 --> 01:36:05,218
He ran a security check on me.

2152
01:36:05,302 --> 01:36:06,511
Well...

2153
01:36:06,637 --> 01:36:09,598
Yeah, when you sail
on a boat fit for a Bond villain,

2154
01:36:09,681 --> 01:36:12,351
sometimes you need to
play the part. Right?

2155
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:15,062
I think it's time you both
get the fuck off my boat.

2156
01:36:15,187 --> 01:36:16,438
What do you say?

2157
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:18,774
You know, Jordan,
I'll tell you something.

2158
01:36:18,857 --> 01:36:21,860
Most of the Wall Street
jackasses that I bust,

2159
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:24,613
they're to the manor born.

2160
01:36:24,696 --> 01:36:25,781
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

2161
01:36:25,864 --> 01:36:29,493
Their fathers are douche bags,
just like their fathers before them.

2162
01:36:30,619 --> 01:36:32,037
But you...

2163
01:36:33,747 --> 01:36:36,041
You, Jordan,
you got this way all on your own.

2164
01:36:36,208 --> 01:36:37,376
Did I?

2165
01:36:37,459 --> 01:36:39,544
- Good for you, little man.
- Little man?

2166
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:40,921
Good for you.

2167
01:36:41,046 --> 01:36:42,172
Me, the little man?

2168
01:36:42,255 --> 01:36:43,298
And let me tell you something.

2169
01:36:43,382 --> 01:36:45,217
Let me tell you something else.

2170
01:36:45,342 --> 01:36:47,511
Honestly, I'm not bullshitting here,

2171
01:36:47,678 --> 01:36:48,804
this is one of the nicest boats

2172
01:36:48,887 --> 01:36:50,889
- that I've ever been on, I gotta tell you.
- I bet it is.

2173
01:36:50,973 --> 01:36:52,391
And you know
what I was just thinking, too?

2174
01:36:52,516 --> 01:36:55,769
The fucking hero that I'm gonna be
back at the office

2175
01:36:55,894 --> 01:36:58,063
when the Bureau seizes
this fucking boat.

2176
01:36:58,188 --> 01:37:00,357
Because, I mean,
fuckety-fuck-fuck, Jordan,

2177
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,733
look at this thing!

2178
01:37:02,109 --> 01:37:03,151
It's beautiful!

2179
01:37:03,235 --> 01:37:06,196
And you got the beautiful girls there.
It's wonderful.

2180
01:37:06,279 --> 01:37:08,740
All right, get the fuck off my boat.

2181
01:37:08,907 --> 01:37:10,450
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other

2182
01:37:10,534 --> 01:37:11,576
- real soon.
- I'm sure.

2183
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:15,122
Good luck on that subway ride home
to your miserable, ugly fucking wives.

2184
01:37:15,205 --> 01:37:18,291
I'm gonna have Heidi lick some caviar
off my balls in the meantime.

2185
01:37:18,417 --> 01:37:21,044
Hey, you guys want to take
some lobsters for your ride home?

2186
01:37:21,128 --> 01:37:23,755
Fucking miserable pricks,
I know you can't afford them!

2187
01:37:23,839 --> 01:37:25,924
Fucking cheap fucks.

2188
01:37:26,091 --> 01:37:28,051
Fucking miserable pricks.

2189
01:37:28,135 --> 01:37:31,346
Hey, fellas! Look what
I found in my pocket! Look!

2190
01:37:31,638 --> 01:37:33,390
A year's salary right here.

2191
01:37:33,473 --> 01:37:36,143
You know what I call them?
Fun coupons!

2192
01:37:36,226 --> 01:37:37,477
See that!

2193
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:40,022
They're fun coupons!

2194
01:37:47,821 --> 01:37:50,574
Switzerland?
What the fuck is in Switzerland?

2195
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:52,701
<i>Swiss fucking banks, that's what.</i>

2196
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:55,454
<i>It was ass-covering time.
I had to hide my money.</i>

2197
01:37:56,747 --> 01:37:58,290
<i>Enter Rugrat.</i>

2198
01:37:58,415 --> 01:38:00,042
<i>He knew this Swiss banker
from law school.</i>

2199
01:38:00,125 --> 01:38:01,168
That's for European pussy!

2200
01:38:01,251 --> 01:38:02,502
<i>But he was in Geneva.</i>

2201
01:38:02,586 --> 01:38:04,963
<i>And there was no way
I was gonna make that flight sober.</i>

2202
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:08,425
<i>So I knew if I took my drugs right,</i>

2203
01:38:08,508 --> 01:38:10,552
<i>I could sleep through the entire flight.</i>

2204
01:38:10,969 --> 01:38:13,305
<i>But I had to take them just right.</i>

2205
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:15,974
<i>At 4:</i><i>00 p.m., I popped a few more ludes,</i>

2206
01:38:16,058 --> 01:38:17,517
<i>which started kicking in by the time</i>

2207
01:38:17,601 --> 01:38:19,352
<i>I finished my sales meeting.</i>

2208
01:38:19,603 --> 01:38:20,812
<i>My tingle phase.</i>

2209
01:38:21,146 --> 01:38:22,814
<i>By dinner, I popped a few more</i>

2210
01:38:22,898 --> 01:38:25,817
<i>on top of some cocktails
and a Valium or two.</i>

2211
01:38:25,984 --> 01:38:27,486
<i>My slur phase.</i>

2212
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:31,990
<i>By 8:</i><i>30, I took a few more ludes</i>

2213
01:38:32,199 --> 01:38:34,785
<i>and pretty much lost all my motor skills.</i>

2214
01:38:35,035 --> 01:38:36,536
<i>This was the drool phase.</i>

2215
01:38:39,581 --> 01:38:42,959
<i>And by 10:</i><i>00, I didn't know
who or what the fuck I was.</i>

2216
01:38:43,043 --> 01:38:44,628
<i>The amnesia phase.</i>

2217
01:38:45,545 --> 01:38:47,506
<i>We boarded the plane
just before midnight.</i>

2218
01:38:47,589 --> 01:38:49,299
Wow! Look at you!

2219
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:51,343
- You're beautiful.
- Excuse me, sir.

2220
01:38:51,551 --> 01:38:53,720
His sleeping pills just kicked in.
He's all right.

2221
01:38:53,804 --> 01:38:55,347
May I see your boarding passes, sir?

2222
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:57,182
We have the boarding passes.

2223
01:38:57,307 --> 01:38:59,309
Jesus Christ, I wanna fuck her.

2224
01:38:59,935 --> 01:39:01,645
Hey! Fucking relax.

2225
01:39:01,853 --> 01:39:03,897
Oh, my God!
You got your hand on my fucking cock!

2226
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:05,357
I don't. Cut it out.

2227
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,441
He's got his hand on my dick again.

2228
01:39:06,525 --> 01:39:07,526
I'm just trying to buckle you up.

2229
01:39:07,609 --> 01:39:08,819
You got your hand on his dick?

2230
01:39:08,902 --> 01:39:10,862
You gotta stop doing that
in public places.

2231
01:39:10,946 --> 01:39:12,906
Oh, my God. Take it off!

2232
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:14,199
Take it off!

2233
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:16,993
I heard there's
a treasure map under here.

2234
01:39:17,119 --> 01:39:19,663
- Stop! I know, miss.
- Excuse me, sir.

2235
01:39:19,746 --> 01:39:21,248
Please sit down.

2236
01:39:21,331 --> 01:39:22,791
- Watch it.
- Go back to your seat, please.

2237
01:39:22,874 --> 01:39:25,168
- What are you upset about?
- Please go back to your seat.

2238
01:39:25,252 --> 01:39:27,129
I will have to call the captain.

2239
01:39:27,212 --> 01:39:29,714
Please, sir, please, sir. Sit down.

2240
01:39:29,798 --> 01:39:31,466
Please sit down!

2241
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:33,135
- I'm going! Stop.
- Okay, sorry.

2242
01:39:33,218 --> 01:39:34,845
We apologize. We're gonna go to sleep.

2243
01:39:34,928 --> 01:39:36,138
Question. I wanna ask you a question.

2244
01:39:36,221 --> 01:39:37,764
Fasten your seat belt, sir.

2245
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:39,933
We cannot take off
if you haven't fastened

2246
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:41,059
- your seat belt.
- I'm really horny, too.

2247
01:39:41,143 --> 01:39:42,269
Sit down. Fasten it.

2248
01:39:42,352 --> 01:39:43,854
- Right. Okay, I'll sit down...
- I will do it for you.

2249
01:39:43,937 --> 01:39:44,938
- What?
- I'll do it for you.

2250
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:46,189
You gotta speak English.

2251
01:39:46,273 --> 01:39:48,233
We don't understand
this language you're speaking.

2252
01:39:48,316 --> 01:39:49,818
I will help him with his seat belt.

2253
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:53,029
- You gotta put it on right.
- Sit back. Sit back, sir.

2254
01:39:53,238 --> 01:39:55,240
- There you go.
- All right. I'll just lean back...

2255
01:39:57,576 --> 01:39:59,244
<i>Bitte, Hilfe!</i>

2256
01:40:14,509 --> 01:40:15,802
Jesus Christ!

2257
01:40:15,886 --> 01:40:17,262
Fuck!

2258
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:20,307
Donnie...

2259
01:40:20,432 --> 01:40:23,518
Donnie, this isn't funny.
You gotta untie me, buddy.

2260
01:40:24,144 --> 01:40:25,854
I can't untie you.

2261
01:40:25,937 --> 01:40:28,773
The captain tied you up.
He almost fucking tasered you.

2262
01:40:29,733 --> 01:40:30,775
Why?

2263
01:40:31,109 --> 01:40:32,152
Why?

2264
01:40:33,862 --> 01:40:35,113
He's got a fear of flying.

2265
01:40:39,492 --> 01:40:41,036
He's very nervous on planes, I'm sorry,

2266
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:42,913
it's not you, sweetheart,
don't beat yourself up.

2267
01:40:43,205 --> 01:40:45,957
Easy, easy. He's fine.
He's just a nervous flyer.

2268
01:40:46,124 --> 01:40:48,293
You were screaming at people.

2269
01:40:48,376 --> 01:40:49,753
Oh, fuck off.

2270
01:40:49,836 --> 01:40:51,963
You were on the floor
rolling around and shit.

2271
01:40:52,047 --> 01:40:53,089
Oh, Jesus.

2272
01:40:53,173 --> 01:40:55,258
You called the captain the N-word.

2273
01:40:55,342 --> 01:40:56,843
I called the captain the N-word?

2274
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:59,179
- Yeah, he was very upset.
- Really?

2275
01:40:59,304 --> 01:41:01,640
- Luckily we're in first class.
- Jesus.

2276
01:41:02,474 --> 01:41:05,310
Jesus Christ, I think
you have a fucking drug problem.

2277
01:41:06,603 --> 01:41:07,896
Where are the ludes?

2278
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:09,022
Where are the ludes?

2279
01:41:10,065 --> 01:41:11,566
They're up my ass. Don't worry about it.

2280
01:41:11,650 --> 01:41:13,235
- I got it.
- Okay.

2281
01:41:13,318 --> 01:41:14,903
Thank God.

2282
01:41:15,362 --> 01:41:17,822
Jesus Christ, what are we gonna do
when we get to Switzerland, buddy?

2283
01:41:17,948 --> 01:41:18,949
This is bad.

2284
01:41:19,032 --> 01:41:21,368
Fucking things are against
my chest. I can't breathe.

2285
01:41:21,493 --> 01:41:23,245
Come on, do something
to calm me down. Please.

2286
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:25,038
Okay, shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.

2287
01:41:25,622 --> 01:41:26,706
Okay.

2288
01:41:28,333 --> 01:41:29,584
- That's good.
- Go to sleep.

2289
01:41:29,668 --> 01:41:30,794
Rub it harder, buddy.

2290
01:41:30,919 --> 01:41:32,504
You're all right.

2291
01:41:32,879 --> 01:41:35,173
We all love you. Shut the fuck up!

2292
01:41:41,012 --> 01:41:43,890
Mr. Belfort, you're free to go.

2293
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:47,185
Really?

2294
01:41:51,231 --> 01:41:52,357
- Hey, Donnie.
- Yeah?

2295
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:53,942
When we get out there,
try not to act like yourself.

2296
01:41:54,025 --> 01:41:56,319
Okay? Let's make Geneva
an asshole-free Donnie zone, all right?

2297
01:41:56,403 --> 01:41:57,821
What are you fucking coming at me for?

2298
01:41:57,904 --> 01:41:59,447
Hey, listen. The only reason
you're sitting in this limo

2299
01:41:59,531 --> 01:42:01,116
and not in a Swiss jail
is because of my friend. Okay?

2300
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:02,367
<i>Hilfe!</i>

2301
01:42:03,326 --> 01:42:05,745
We're here. We're here.
Everyone calm down.

2302
01:42:06,246 --> 01:42:07,664
Jordan Belfort!

2303
01:42:07,747 --> 01:42:08,999
At last.

2304
01:42:09,082 --> 01:42:11,668
Nicholas has told me
so much about you.

2305
01:42:11,751 --> 01:42:13,628
Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.

2306
01:42:13,878 --> 01:42:16,256
- Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- Nice to meet you.

2307
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,049
It's a joke.

2308
01:42:18,174 --> 01:42:20,427
You'll understand
when you're in the fucking seat.

2309
01:42:20,802 --> 01:42:22,387
You need a bigger couch. For guests.

2310
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:24,180
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I don't understand. I'm sorry.

2311
01:42:24,264 --> 01:42:27,100
I'm curious about
your bank secrecy laws here.

2312
01:42:28,727 --> 01:42:31,896
Wait. Yes. <i>Excusez-moi,</i> Jordan.

2313
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:35,525
Swiss custom requires 10 minutes of...

2314
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:36,651
Blah, blah, blah.

2315
01:42:36,735 --> 01:42:38,361
- Chit chat.
- Yeah, chit chat, thank you.

2316
01:42:38,445 --> 01:42:40,071
...before business can be discussed.

2317
01:42:41,614 --> 01:42:42,741
Yeah.

2318
01:42:45,535 --> 01:42:46,578
Of course.

2319
01:42:47,245 --> 01:42:50,040
Let's get down to it.
What would you like to know?

2320
01:42:50,582 --> 01:42:53,460
Under what circumstances
would you be obligated

2321
01:42:53,543 --> 01:42:55,712
to cooperate with an FBI

2322
01:42:56,087 --> 01:42:59,174
or a U.S. Justice Department
investigation, for example?

2323
01:42:59,799 --> 01:43:00,967
<i>Ça depend.</i>

2324
01:43:01,593 --> 01:43:02,719
<i>Ça depend?</i>

2325
01:43:02,802 --> 01:43:03,803
<i>Oui.</i>

2326
01:43:04,888 --> 01:43:07,557
<i>Ça depend</i> on what, exactly?

2327
01:43:08,350 --> 01:43:10,602
Whether America plans
to invade Switzerland

2328
01:43:10,685 --> 01:43:12,270
in the coming months.

2329
01:43:12,729 --> 01:43:14,939
Shall I check if tanks
are rolling down the Rue de la Croy?

2330
01:43:15,023 --> 01:43:17,108
- Yes. Rue de la Croix.
- Croix. Croix.

2331
01:43:17,192 --> 01:43:20,028
Not Croy. Not Rue de la Croy. It's Croix.

2332
01:43:20,236 --> 01:43:22,447
See, this is what he used to do
back in law school. Check me.

2333
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:24,282
- Champagne. <i>Champagne.</i>
- Yeah.

2334
01:43:24,366 --> 01:43:26,743
Yeah, yeah.
French fries, <i>pommes frites.</i>

2335
01:43:27,494 --> 01:43:30,038
- And that kind of stuff.
- That's funny.

2336
01:43:31,456 --> 01:43:36,503
<i>What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,
is are you going to fuck me over?</i>

2337
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:42,801
<i>I understand perfectly,
you American shit.</i>

2338
01:43:44,969 --> 01:43:47,347
The only way
the Banque Réal de Genève

2339
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:49,516
would cooperate
with a foreign legal body

2340
01:43:49,641 --> 01:43:53,770
is if the crime being pursued
is also a crime in Switzerland.

2341
01:43:53,895 --> 01:43:58,441
But there are very few Swiss laws
which apply to your practices.

2342
01:43:59,651 --> 01:44:01,277
From a financial standpoint,

2343
01:44:01,361 --> 01:44:04,447
you are now in heaven.

2344
01:44:04,614 --> 01:44:06,491
See, I told you he was fantastic, right?

2345
01:44:07,242 --> 01:44:11,788
If the U.S. Justice Department
sent us a subpoena, it would become

2346
01:44:12,247 --> 01:44:13,873
<i>papier toilette.</i>

2347
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:17,001
We would wipe our ass with it.

2348
01:44:17,669 --> 01:44:20,255
Unless, of course,
it was an investigation

2349
01:44:20,338 --> 01:44:22,173
into stock fraud,

2350
01:44:22,257 --> 01:44:24,426
which is a crime here in Switzerland,
if I'm correct.

2351
01:44:24,509 --> 01:44:28,513
Then there would
have to be <i>coopėration</i> on your part,

2352
01:44:28,638 --> 01:44:30,598
- if I'm not mistaken.
- Yes.

2353
01:44:30,765 --> 01:44:33,184
Yes, we would.

2354
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:35,895
Assuming the account
is under your name.

2355
01:44:37,105 --> 01:44:40,150
If it were another name,

2356
01:44:41,359 --> 01:44:42,986
a friend's, <i>camarade...</i>

2357
01:44:43,069 --> 01:44:44,154
Cousin?

2358
01:44:48,908 --> 01:44:50,618
- Relative?
- Yeah.

2359
01:44:52,829 --> 01:44:55,457
<i>Was that yodeling I just heard</i>

2360
01:44:55,582 --> 01:44:58,042
<i>or did you just say
what I thought you said?</i>

2361
01:44:58,126 --> 01:44:59,878
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

2362
01:45:00,628 --> 01:45:03,173
<i>He's telling me to use a fucking rat hole.</i>

2363
01:45:03,381 --> 01:45:05,049
<i>But a U.S. rat hole would never get</i>

2364
01:45:05,133 --> 01:45:07,343
<i>into Switzerland with all that money.</i>

2365
01:45:07,427 --> 01:45:11,264
<i>What I needed was a rat hole
with a European passport.</i>

2366
01:45:18,563 --> 01:45:19,981
Jordan.

2367
01:45:20,064 --> 01:45:22,942
Hey. How's my favorite aunt, huh?

2368
01:45:23,026 --> 01:45:24,444
Welcome. Was the traffic terrible?

2369
01:45:24,527 --> 01:45:26,070
Oh, no, not at all.

2370
01:45:28,615 --> 01:45:30,241
Jordan, come in.

2371
01:45:30,408 --> 01:45:32,911
<i>Thank God Aunt Emma
didn't need too much convincing.</i>

2372
01:45:33,578 --> 01:45:36,080
<i>Turned out the British
weren't too different from the Swiss.</i>

2373
01:45:36,247 --> 01:45:38,750
<i>Money talks and bullshit takes the bus.</i>

2374
01:45:39,209 --> 01:45:41,127
<i>How do you say "rat hole" in British?</i>

2375
01:45:41,544 --> 01:45:44,005
If you get into any trouble whatsoever,

2376
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:46,841
I'll come forth immediately.
I'll say that I duped you.

2377
01:45:46,925 --> 01:45:48,218
That I promise.

2378
01:45:48,927 --> 01:45:51,596
Risk is what keeps us young,
isn't it, darling?

2379
01:45:55,934 --> 01:45:57,727
Sometimes I wonder

2380
01:45:58,019 --> 01:46:01,022
if you let money get
the best of you, my love.

2381
01:46:01,147 --> 01:46:04,275
Among other substances.

2382
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:10,073
It's that obvious, huh?

2383
01:46:10,156 --> 01:46:13,409
It's chilly, darling,
and you're sweating bullets.

2384
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:17,956
What can I say? I'm...

2385
01:46:18,831 --> 01:46:20,500
I'm a drug addict.

2386
01:46:20,625 --> 01:46:21,960
I really am.

2387
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:24,754
Cocaine, pills,

2388
01:46:25,255 --> 01:46:27,674
whatever it is, I'll fucking do it.

2389
01:46:28,216 --> 01:46:29,926
Now that's the truth.

2390
01:46:30,009 --> 01:46:31,261
I mean...

2391
01:46:31,344 --> 01:46:32,720
I'm a sex addict, too.

2392
01:46:33,638 --> 01:46:36,057
Well, there are worse things
to be addicted to than sex.

2393
01:46:37,350 --> 01:46:39,727
Jesus, why am I telling you all this?
Why am I...

2394
01:46:39,811 --> 01:46:41,437
I'm sorry.

2395
01:46:42,188 --> 01:46:44,399
Because I'm very easy to talk to.

2396
01:46:44,774 --> 01:46:47,485
You are. You are easy to talk to.

2397
01:46:48,653 --> 01:46:50,071
I suppose it's...

2398
01:46:50,154 --> 01:46:51,573
Just my job, you know.

2399
01:46:52,824 --> 01:46:54,784
All these people dependent on me.

2400
01:46:54,867 --> 01:46:57,579
Tens of millions of dollars
at stake, you know.

2401
01:46:57,662 --> 01:46:59,372
Sometimes I feel like I...

2402
01:46:59,455 --> 01:47:02,625
I've bitten off more than
I can chew, you know.

2403
01:47:02,834 --> 01:47:05,128
You're a man with large appetites.

2404
01:47:05,295 --> 01:47:06,379
Yeah.

2405
01:47:08,089 --> 01:47:10,008
<i>Is she fucking hitting on me?</i>

2406
01:47:10,341 --> 01:47:11,384
Yeah.

2407
01:47:11,509 --> 01:47:12,802
Yeah, I am.

2408
01:47:15,179 --> 01:47:18,516
I suppose I put that
on myself though, right?

2409
01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:20,393
My decision.

2410
01:47:20,893 --> 01:47:22,353
It's just hard to...

2411
01:47:22,437 --> 01:47:26,357
Hard to learn to control
the anxiety sometimes, you know?

2412
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:28,484
You know, to...

2413
01:47:28,693 --> 01:47:31,362
Learn to relax and let go and...

2414
01:47:32,363 --> 01:47:34,365
To release the tension.

2415
01:47:35,408 --> 01:47:36,868
<i>She is hitting on me.</i>

2416
01:47:37,827 --> 01:47:39,245
<i>Holy shit!</i>

2417
01:47:39,537 --> 01:47:41,789
Yeah, to release the tension.

2418
01:47:45,627 --> 01:47:47,378
I suppose we...

2419
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,256
We all just need to learn...

2420
01:47:50,882 --> 01:47:54,177
Learn to do what
comes naturally in life, you know?

2421
01:47:56,095 --> 01:47:58,556
<i>Is he fucking hitting on me?</i>

2422
01:48:04,771 --> 01:48:06,439
Stability, dear.

2423
01:48:06,522 --> 01:48:07,940
Family.

2424
01:48:14,572 --> 01:48:16,741
You take care of my niece, my love.

2425
01:48:16,824 --> 01:48:19,369
I'll take care of everything over here.

2426
01:48:20,328 --> 01:48:21,412
Deal.

2427
01:48:23,956 --> 01:48:26,125
Come on! There you go.

2428
01:48:28,169 --> 01:48:31,422
<i>We had, literally, a fuck load of money.</i>

2429
01:48:31,923 --> 01:48:33,925
<i>Aunt Emma could never
carry all this by herself</i>

2430
01:48:34,759 --> 01:48:38,429
<i>So I thought to myself,
who else has a European passport?</i>

2431
01:48:38,596 --> 01:48:40,515
Brad, you're making this
too fucking tight!

2432
01:48:40,598 --> 01:48:43,393
<i>Now Brad, as a successful drug dealer,</i>

2433
01:48:43,476 --> 01:48:45,687
<i>spent his winters in the south of France,</i>

2434
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:47,814
<i>which is where
he met his wife, Chantalle,</i>

2435
01:48:47,897 --> 01:48:50,775
<i>a stripper of Slovenian origin</i>

2436
01:48:50,942 --> 01:48:52,360
<i>born, in of all places,</i>

2437
01:48:52,944 --> 01:48:54,445
<i>Switzerland.</i>

2438
01:48:58,616 --> 01:49:00,284
Well, this is fucked.

2439
01:49:01,327 --> 01:49:02,787
No shit.

2440
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:08,751
Like, this will take her like 50 trips.

2441
01:49:08,835 --> 01:49:10,044
I know.

2442
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:14,966
Let me ask you something?

2443
01:49:15,091 --> 01:49:17,677
What about her family? Right?

2444
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:20,430
I mean, they all got
Swiss passports, right.

2445
01:49:20,513 --> 01:49:22,390
She's got parents,
she's got a brother, right?

2446
01:49:22,473 --> 01:49:24,392
The brother's got a wife.
That's five fucking people.

2447
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:26,394
Six, seven trips, boom, right?

2448
01:49:26,477 --> 01:49:28,062
They're all fucking
Swiss nitwits like her.

2449
01:49:28,146 --> 01:49:29,397
- They'll do it.
- We could do that.

2450
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:31,941
At least I have a family,
you crooked-nose fuck!

2451
01:49:32,024 --> 01:49:34,861
Hey, don't forget about my money.

2452
01:49:36,654 --> 01:49:37,739
I'm sorry, what's that?

2453
01:49:37,822 --> 01:49:39,282
Yeah, I forgot to tell you.
He's got some...

2454
01:49:39,365 --> 01:49:41,409
- He's got some money.
- My money.

2455
01:49:41,784 --> 01:49:43,995
I got a couple of mil
coming in like a week.

2456
01:49:44,078 --> 01:49:46,664
When it gets in, I'll give you a call,
you come pick it up.

2457
01:49:49,292 --> 01:49:50,710
You give me a call?

2458
01:49:52,336 --> 01:49:55,590
When it gets here, I'll give you a call
and you'll come pick it up.

2459
01:49:55,673 --> 01:49:57,467
Well, we don't fucking
work for you, man!

2460
01:49:58,009 --> 01:50:00,970
Sweetheart,
you have my money taped to your tits.

2461
01:50:01,053 --> 01:50:03,055
Okay? Technically, you do work for me.

2462
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,685
Hey, Jordan, we're gonna need to talk.

2463
01:50:07,935 --> 01:50:09,437
If I fucking do this,
I'm telling you right now,

2464
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,480
I ain't going to him, okay.

2465
01:50:10,563 --> 01:50:11,606
- I'm not a fucking <i>shvartze.</i>
- I got it.

2466
01:50:11,689 --> 01:50:12,982
I don't do fucking pickups, all right?

2467
01:50:13,065 --> 01:50:14,108
- I got it.
- Well, listen to me.

2468
01:50:14,192 --> 01:50:15,777
We meet someplace that I fucking say.

2469
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:17,236
And you tell that fucking piece of shit,

2470
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:18,488
- he comes correct.
- I will.

2471
01:50:18,571 --> 01:50:20,865
He comes in all fucking loopy
and fucked up, I swear to God

2472
01:50:20,948 --> 01:50:22,784
I'll mash that douchebag's teeth in.

2473
01:50:22,867 --> 01:50:24,619
You're gonna mash
whose fucking teeth in?

2474
01:50:24,702 --> 01:50:26,412
Whose fucking teeth
are you gonna mash in?

2475
01:50:26,496 --> 01:50:28,790
I put the money on that
fucking table! Not you!

2476
01:50:28,873 --> 01:50:30,708
I'm the reason
we have this whole fucking deal!

2477
01:50:30,792 --> 01:50:32,794
- He's got a gun, you fucking idiot!
- Fuck his gun!

2478
01:50:32,877 --> 01:50:34,253
I put that money in there!

2479
01:50:34,337 --> 01:50:35,713
You know what?
You're a fucking pill dealer.

2480
01:50:35,797 --> 01:50:38,090
I got five more just like you, bro.

2481
01:50:38,174 --> 01:50:39,884
Keep talking, you fucking piece of shit!

2482
01:50:39,967 --> 01:50:41,719
You know what else?
You dress like shit!

2483
01:50:41,803 --> 01:50:42,804
So fuck you!

2484
01:50:42,887 --> 01:50:44,639
- Fucking motherfucker!
- Oh! Jesus!

2485
01:50:44,722 --> 01:50:46,557
How about that, faggot?
Who's a faggot?

2486
01:50:46,682 --> 01:50:48,476
You okay? Hey, pal.

2487
01:50:51,187 --> 01:50:53,981
<i>The next day,
Aunt Emma flew to Geneva.</i>

2488
01:50:54,065 --> 01:50:56,400
<i>Two million in cash in her carry-on,</i>

2489
01:50:56,484 --> 01:50:59,445
<i>which in the big picture
was a drop in the Swiss bucket.</i>

2490
01:51:00,696 --> 01:51:01,989
<i>'Cause the following month,</i>

2491
01:51:02,073 --> 01:51:03,950
<i>over the course of six round trips,</i>

2492
01:51:04,033 --> 01:51:08,079
<i>Chantalle's family and friends
smuggled in over 20 million in cash</i>

2493
01:51:08,162 --> 01:51:09,914
<i>without even a hiccup.</i>

2494
01:51:14,919 --> 01:51:16,838
- And I have some more.
- Really?

2495
01:51:16,921 --> 01:51:18,130
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

2496
01:51:18,214 --> 01:51:19,340
<i>And here.</i>

2497
01:51:19,423 --> 01:51:21,425
<i>-Welcome.
- Welcome.</i>

2498
01:51:21,509 --> 01:51:23,761
Yeah, like four bags of it.

2499
01:51:25,388 --> 01:51:27,723
Are you Swiss-Slovakian
or Swiss-Slovenian?

2500
01:51:27,807 --> 01:51:29,350
- Slovenian.
- Slovenian?

2501
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:30,643
Who cares. You're blonde.

2502
01:51:30,726 --> 01:51:31,727
Oh, stop.

2503
01:51:52,582 --> 01:51:53,708
Shit.

2504
01:51:53,791 --> 01:51:55,042
Just put the fucking car in park,

2505
01:51:55,126 --> 01:51:56,919
you dumb fucking idiot!

2506
01:51:58,462 --> 01:52:00,089
I can't close this briefcase.

2507
01:52:00,172 --> 01:52:01,549
One fucking day.

2508
01:52:01,632 --> 01:52:03,593
One fucking day,
you couldn't keep it together?

2509
01:52:03,676 --> 01:52:05,261
I'm fucked up, Brad.

2510
01:52:05,803 --> 01:52:08,431
- Gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Fucked up.

2511
01:52:13,269 --> 01:52:14,770
- It's a joke.
- It's a joke?

2512
01:52:14,854 --> 01:52:16,814
- I'm sober.
- Jesus fucking Christ!

2513
01:52:16,898 --> 01:52:17,899
It's a fucking joke.

2514
01:52:17,982 --> 01:52:19,567
- Are you fucking stupid?
- I'm not stupid.

2515
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,110
You fucking drive in here
like a fucking maniac,

2516
01:52:21,193 --> 01:52:23,029
you know the attention that
that fucking draws?

2517
01:52:23,112 --> 01:52:25,781
- I'm not stupid. I'm smart.
- Smart?

2518
01:52:25,865 --> 01:52:27,950
- I make million-dollar deals.
- That right?

2519
01:52:28,034 --> 01:52:30,411
With smart important people,
unlike you.

2520
01:52:30,494 --> 01:52:34,373
People who don't sucker-punch people
when they're scared. Okay?

2521
01:52:34,457 --> 01:52:35,833
- I'm scared, huh?
- And by the way,

2522
01:52:35,917 --> 01:52:36,918
I haven't gotten an apology yet for that.

2523
01:52:37,001 --> 01:52:38,044
You want an apology, okay.

2524
01:52:38,127 --> 01:52:39,545
I check my fucking messages every day

2525
01:52:39,629 --> 01:52:40,588
- when I come home from work.
- Did you?

2526
01:52:40,671 --> 01:52:41,923
- My answering machine. Zero.
- Didn't get one, huh?

2527
01:52:42,006 --> 01:52:43,049
I got a blinking light,

2528
01:52:43,132 --> 01:52:44,425
because I don't have shit from you.

2529
01:52:44,508 --> 01:52:45,718
You know what, you got
a big fucking mouth, okay?

2530
01:52:45,801 --> 01:52:47,053
I got my wife checking the messages

2531
01:52:47,136 --> 01:52:49,138
every 45 minutes
calling the office, saying,

2532
01:52:49,221 --> 01:52:50,431
"Has Brad apologized yet?

2533
01:52:50,514 --> 01:52:52,516
"Is there an apology message
on the machine?"

2534
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:54,143
I don't have jack shit. You know what?

2535
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:55,645
That's not how you treat people.

2536
01:52:55,728 --> 01:52:56,771
You got a big fucking mouth, you know.

2537
01:52:56,854 --> 01:52:58,522
I'm gonna give you a fucking pass.
Just give me the case.

2538
01:52:58,606 --> 01:53:00,816
You're gonna give me a pass?

2539
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:02,485
Look, it's a figure of fucking speech.

2540
01:53:02,568 --> 01:53:04,528
Oh, my gosh. The Emperor of Fucksville

2541
01:53:04,612 --> 01:53:05,905
came down from Fucksville
to give me a pass!

2542
01:53:05,988 --> 01:53:06,989
From Fucksville, huh?

2543
01:53:07,073 --> 01:53:08,950
Hey, what are the citizens
of Fucksville doing today

2544
01:53:09,033 --> 01:53:10,493
when their Emperor's gone?

2545
01:53:10,576 --> 01:53:12,119
Is it mayhem?

2546
01:53:12,203 --> 01:53:13,996
Are people looting and raping?

2547
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:16,082
What are all the little fuckheads
doing while you're here?

2548
01:53:16,165 --> 01:53:17,583
Go fuck yourself! Give me the bag.

2549
01:53:17,667 --> 01:53:18,960
You back the fuck up.

2550
01:53:19,043 --> 01:53:22,505
I'll cause the biggest fucking scene
that I've ever caused in my life

2551
01:53:22,588 --> 01:53:24,340
if you come at me again.

2552
01:53:24,423 --> 01:53:26,008
- You know what?
- Just fucking keep it down.

2553
01:53:26,092 --> 01:53:27,301
I got...

2554
01:53:27,385 --> 01:53:31,973
I don't wanna be out of line or anything,
but I think you like, like me. Like you...

2555
01:53:32,056 --> 01:53:33,516
Like when you come at me...

2556
01:53:33,599 --> 01:53:34,684
What's the matter with you?
What the fuck is...

2557
01:53:34,767 --> 01:53:36,185
...and you look at me.
I swear I just noticed it.

2558
01:53:36,268 --> 01:53:37,979
You have like a fucking, like...

2559
01:53:38,062 --> 01:53:40,064
Like a twinkle. You have like a twinkle.

2560
01:53:40,147 --> 01:53:41,607
Are you trying to kiss me, bro?

2561
01:53:41,691 --> 01:53:43,275
Jesus fucking Christ.

2562
01:53:43,359 --> 01:53:45,319
- What's with you?
- I have a... I don't know.

2563
01:53:45,403 --> 01:53:47,113
- It's not a homophobic thing.
- All right...

2564
01:53:47,196 --> 01:53:48,906
You're just not the one for me, pal.

2565
01:53:48,990 --> 01:53:50,116
You know what I mean? It's not...

2566
01:53:50,199 --> 01:53:52,118
- It's not about that for me, you know.
- I've heard enough.

2567
01:53:52,201 --> 01:53:54,620
Please, I'm begging,
give me the fucking case.

2568
01:53:54,704 --> 01:53:56,080
- I'm gonna give you the case.
- Give me the case.

2569
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:57,540
- You gotta do me one favor.
- What's that?

2570
01:53:57,623 --> 01:54:00,918
You gotta take this case,
you gotta drive straight home,

2571
01:54:01,002 --> 01:54:04,505
need you to open up the briefcase,
and you take out every single dollar.

2572
01:54:04,588 --> 01:54:06,549
Don't leave one dollar
inside the briefcase.

2573
01:54:06,632 --> 01:54:07,758
And once you have it all

2574
01:54:07,842 --> 01:54:09,635
neatly organized outside the briefcase,

2575
01:54:09,719 --> 01:54:12,013
I need you to take it
and I need you to shove it right up

2576
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:14,181
your wife's Latvian cunt,
you understand?

2577
01:54:14,265 --> 01:54:15,933
- My fucking wife!
- Chill! Chill, bro.

2578
01:54:16,017 --> 01:54:17,476
Fuck. You motherfucking piece of shit!

2579
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:18,602
How about now?

2580
01:54:18,769 --> 01:54:20,146
- Go, go!
- Fuck!

2581
01:54:21,897 --> 01:54:23,607
Motherfuck! You're fucking dead!

2582
01:54:23,691 --> 01:54:25,359
Stop! Don't move! Don't move!

2583
01:54:25,443 --> 01:54:28,279
Stop, or I will blow you the fuck away!

2584
01:54:28,696 --> 01:54:30,865
Drop the case!
Put your hands in the air!

2585
01:54:30,948 --> 01:54:32,074
Get down.

2586
01:54:32,867 --> 01:54:34,618
Get down on your knees!
Get down on your knees!

2587
01:54:35,327 --> 01:54:36,746
Motherfucker!

2588
01:54:38,789 --> 01:54:39,832
Motherfucker!

2589
01:54:49,008 --> 01:54:52,219
Jordan, do I have a surprise for you!

2590
01:54:52,470 --> 01:54:55,056
- What's that?
- Twenty real Lemmons.

2591
01:54:55,139 --> 01:54:56,307
Retired pharmacist's client of mine,

2592
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,558
they've been in the safe for 15 years.

2593
01:54:57,641 --> 01:54:59,101
Are you fucking kidding me? Lemmons?

2594
01:55:00,352 --> 01:55:02,229
They're gonna knock us
on our fucking heads.

2595
01:55:02,313 --> 01:55:07,234
<i>When it comes to Quaaludes,
the Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail.</i>

2596
01:55:07,318 --> 01:55:08,819
- Can you believe it?
- Oh, my God.

2597
01:55:08,903 --> 01:55:10,362
I thought they were like a myth.

2598
01:55:10,446 --> 01:55:12,323
<i>Three times as powerful
as anything available today.</i>

2599
01:55:12,406 --> 01:55:13,449
Look at these babies.

2600
01:55:13,532 --> 01:55:16,118
<i>Boy, Donnie really knew
how to celebrate.</i>

2601
01:55:16,202 --> 01:55:18,287
<i>He said he was saving these
for a special occasion.</i>

2602
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:20,956
<i>Like a birthday, or being clap free,</i>

2603
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:24,001
<i>or our money arriving
safely in Switzerland.</i>

2604
01:55:27,421 --> 01:55:28,672
<i>So that night,</i>

2605
01:55:28,756 --> 01:55:30,591
<i>I cleared my schedule and I rid my body</i>

2606
01:55:30,674 --> 01:55:33,177
<i>of anything that could fuck with my high.</i>

2607
01:55:33,886 --> 01:55:35,679
<i>It was celebration time.</i>

2608
01:55:36,263 --> 01:55:37,431
Okay.

2609
01:55:37,515 --> 01:55:39,016
Start off with one, see how it goes?

2610
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:40,851
My guy says all we'll need is one.

2611
01:55:40,935 --> 01:55:42,353
Here you go.

2612
01:55:43,062 --> 01:55:44,730
- <i>Salud!</i>
- Cheers.

2613
01:55:44,814 --> 01:55:47,608
<i>Maybe if I pull it again, it'll go down.</i>

2614
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:50,611
<i>Steve! Steve!</i>

2615
01:55:50,694 --> 01:55:51,946
<i>I gotta get out of here!</i>

2616
01:55:52,029 --> 01:55:53,906
<i>Carl, I think I got it figured out.</i>

2617
01:55:53,989 --> 01:55:57,701
<i>It must be one pull for up
and two pulls for down.</i>

2618
01:55:57,785 --> 01:55:59,036
<i>Okay.</i>

2619
01:56:07,378 --> 01:56:09,171
Do you feel anything?

2620
01:56:11,841 --> 01:56:13,008
No.

2621
01:56:15,719 --> 01:56:17,555
It's been 35 minutes.

2622
01:56:20,057 --> 01:56:23,602
Maybe we've built up a tolerance
after all these years, huh?

2623
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:38,159
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

2624
01:56:38,242 --> 01:56:41,412
My metabolism's pumping.
I can't feel shit!

2625
01:56:41,495 --> 01:56:42,663
They're old.

2626
01:56:42,746 --> 01:56:44,915
You think they lost their potency, huh?

2627
01:56:44,999 --> 01:56:46,625
Check the bottle!

2628
01:56:49,461 --> 01:56:50,880
January '81.

2629
01:56:50,963 --> 01:56:52,047
They're fucking duds.

2630
01:56:52,131 --> 01:56:53,174
Fuck!

2631
01:56:53,257 --> 01:56:54,341
Let's take...

2632
01:56:54,425 --> 01:56:55,926
Let's take two more each.

2633
01:56:57,887 --> 01:57:00,431
- Jordan.
- Yeah, baby.

2634
01:57:04,101 --> 01:57:05,811
What are you two retards doing?

2635
01:57:05,895 --> 01:57:06,979
We're working out, honey.

2636
01:57:07,438 --> 01:57:09,023
Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.

2637
01:57:09,106 --> 01:57:10,107
Okay.

2638
01:57:10,191 --> 01:57:12,109
- Okay?
- Okay.

2639
01:57:13,611 --> 01:57:15,154
Hey, Bo, what's going on?

2640
01:57:15,237 --> 01:57:16,363
Jordan, listen to me clearly.

2641
01:57:16,447 --> 01:57:19,033
I cannot talk to you on this phone,
I have to talk to you.

2642
01:57:19,116 --> 01:57:20,618
<i>Get out of here. What's going on?</i>

2643
01:57:20,701 --> 01:57:24,038
Listen to me!
Leave the fucking house, Jordan,

2644
01:57:24,121 --> 01:57:25,789
and then call me from a pay phone.

2645
01:57:25,873 --> 01:57:27,833
This is not a fucking joke, Jordan.

2646
01:57:27,917 --> 01:57:29,543
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2647
01:57:30,044 --> 01:57:31,378
- Shit.
- What'd he say?

2648
01:57:31,462 --> 01:57:32,838
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

2649
01:57:32,922 --> 01:57:34,882
- I gotta go!
- Is everything okay, Jordan?

2650
01:57:45,309 --> 01:57:47,061
<i>The closest pay phone I could get to</i>

2651
01:57:47,144 --> 01:57:49,438
<i>was at the Brookville Country Club.</i>

2652
01:57:50,105 --> 01:57:52,066
<i>It was a real WASP stronghold,</i>

2653
01:57:52,149 --> 01:57:54,735
<i>just a mile down the road
from my house.</i>

2654
01:58:04,203 --> 01:58:05,621
Hey, Bo, what's up, it's me.
What's going on?

2655
01:58:05,704 --> 01:58:06,747
I'm at a pay phone. What's going on?

2656
01:58:06,830 --> 01:58:07,957
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>

2657
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:11,794
Please. Your little friend there, Brad,
your little buddy, he's in jail.

2658
01:58:12,461 --> 01:58:13,754
What the fuck's he in jail for?

2659
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:15,297
- What'd he do?
- <i>I don't know what he did.</i>

2660
01:58:15,381 --> 01:58:16,715
My friends in Long Island told me

2661
01:58:16,799 --> 01:58:19,009
he got picked up
in some fucking shopping mall.

2662
01:58:19,093 --> 01:58:20,094
He got locked up by...

2663
01:58:20,177 --> 01:58:22,429
Wait, wait. Did you...
Did you say a shopping mall?

2664
01:58:22,513 --> 01:58:23,806
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- He was with Donnie.

2665
01:58:23,889 --> 01:58:25,266
He was supposed
to deliver some money,

2666
01:58:25,349 --> 01:58:26,892
- then that fucking fat piece of shit...
- <i>Listen to me!</i>

2667
01:58:26,976 --> 01:58:27,977
I gotta go fucking talk to him right now!

2668
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:29,979
Listen to me! Don't go! Listen to me.

2669
01:58:30,062 --> 01:58:32,690
That guy Denham, that FBI agent guy,

2670
01:58:32,773 --> 01:58:35,067
somebody told me
he's got your phones tapped.

2671
01:58:35,150 --> 01:58:36,652
Your office and your home.

2672
01:58:36,735 --> 01:58:38,445
<i>Don't talk on the motherfucking phone!</i>

2673
01:58:38,529 --> 01:58:40,447
Okay. Fuck! I got it. I got it. I got it.

2674
01:58:40,906 --> 01:58:42,032
<i>Jordan.</i>

2675
01:58:42,574 --> 01:58:46,370
You didn't try to bribe
this fucking FBI agent, did you?

2676
01:58:46,453 --> 01:58:48,497
No, I didn't try to bribe an FBI agent.

2677
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:50,124
You think I'm that fucking stupid? No.

2678
01:58:50,207 --> 01:58:52,084
<i>What the fuck did you say?
I can't understand you.</i>

2679
01:58:52,167 --> 01:58:53,335
<i>Say that again.</i>

2680
01:58:53,419 --> 01:58:56,213
I said...

2681
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,799
<i>What the fuck are you saying?</i>

2682
01:58:59,383 --> 01:59:00,384
I said...

2683
01:59:00,467 --> 01:59:01,927
<i>Are you fucking high?</i>

2684
01:59:04,555 --> 01:59:07,182
<i>Jordan, are you fucking high?</i>

2685
01:59:08,017 --> 01:59:10,144
<i>Jordan, do me a favor,
stay where you are.</i>

2686
01:59:10,227 --> 01:59:11,854
<i>Don't get behind the wheel of the car.</i>

2687
01:59:11,937 --> 01:59:13,480
<i>I'm gonna send Rocco over
to pick you up.</i>

2688
01:59:13,564 --> 01:59:14,815
<i>Jordan! Jordan!</i>

2689
01:59:14,898 --> 01:59:17,151
<i>After 15 years in storage,</i>

2690
01:59:17,234 --> 01:59:20,195
<i>the Lemmons had
developed a delayed fuse.</i>

2691
01:59:20,279 --> 01:59:22,948
<i>It took 90 minutes for
these little fuckers to kick in.</i>

2692
01:59:23,032 --> 01:59:24,408
<i>But once they did...</i>

2693
01:59:25,951 --> 01:59:27,494
<i>I mean, I had skipped the tingle phase</i>

2694
01:59:27,578 --> 01:59:29,496
<i>and went straight to the drool phase.</i>

2695
01:59:29,580 --> 01:59:31,540
<i>Tell me where you are!
Don't fucking drive...</i>

2696
01:59:31,623 --> 01:59:33,542
<i>These little bastards were so strong,</i>

2697
01:59:33,625 --> 01:59:35,669
<i>I discovered a whole new phase.</i>

2698
01:59:35,753 --> 01:59:37,796
<i>The cerebral palsy phase.</i>

2699
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:42,092
<i>Come on, stand up!</i>

2700
01:59:46,055 --> 01:59:47,973
<i>Okay, walking's out.</i>

2701
01:59:48,932 --> 01:59:51,810
<i>All right, think, think.
What else is there?</i>

2702
01:59:52,644 --> 01:59:56,357
<i>Yes! I can crawl. I can crawl like Skylar!</i>

2703
02:00:28,013 --> 02:00:30,974
<i>Fuck! The kid makes it look
so goddamn easy!</i>

2704
02:00:38,023 --> 02:00:40,401
<i>Think, you motherfucker, think!</i>

2705
02:00:40,484 --> 02:00:41,819
<i>Yes!</i>

2706
02:00:41,902 --> 02:00:43,987
<i>I got it! I've got it!</i>

2707

02:02:15,204 --> 02:02:16,663
I'm at a country club!

2713
02:02:16,747 --> 02:02:17,789
<i>What?</i>

2714
02:02:17,873 --> 02:02:20,709
I'm at a country club!

2715
02:02:20,792 --> 02:02:22,127
<i>I don't know what
the fuck you're saying.</i>

2716
02:02:22,211 --> 02:02:23,462
<i>Look, you need to get home.</i>

2717
02:02:23,545 --> 02:02:26,173
<i>Donnie is out of control!
He's on the other line</i>

2718
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:28,133
<i>with some Swiss guy. I don't know...</i>

2719
02:02:28,217 --> 02:02:29,218
What?

2720
02:02:29,301 --> 02:02:32,262
Get him off the phone!

2721
02:02:32,596 --> 02:02:35,349
<i>I can't understand you!</i>

2722
02:02:35,432 --> 02:02:36,683
Get him

2723
02:02:36,767 --> 02:02:37,809
off

2724
02:02:37,893 --> 02:02:39,019
the phone!

2725
02:02:39,102 --> 02:02:40,354
<i>I don't know what the fuck
you're saying, Jordan.</i>

2726
02:02:40,437 --> 02:02:41,772
<i>Can you just get home? Hurry!</i>

2727
02:02:51,615 --> 02:02:53,742
<i>I was less than a mile from home.</i>

2728
02:02:53,825 --> 02:02:56,537
<i>I drove as slow as I fucking could.</i>

2729
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:58,622
<i>I'd seen Jell-O move faster.</i>

2730
02:02:58,705 --> 02:03:01,124
<i>I was gonna give you two million.</i>

2731
02:03:01,291 --> 02:03:03,835
I's gonna be lates.

2732
02:03:04,503 --> 02:03:06,088
You ate two million?

2733
02:03:07,005 --> 02:03:08,257
Later.

2734
02:03:08,340 --> 02:03:09,466
<i>Get off the phone.</i>

2735
02:03:09,550 --> 02:03:11,051
<i>Get off the fucking phone! Idiot!</i>

2736
02:03:12,427 --> 02:03:14,513
Get out of the way, asshole!

2737
02:03:17,182 --> 02:03:18,433
You hate two million?

2738
02:03:18,517 --> 02:03:20,018
No, you don't hate two million, Donnie.

2739
02:03:22,563 --> 02:03:25,440
<i>By some miracle, I made it home alive,</i>

2740
02:03:25,524 --> 02:03:27,818
<i>not a scratch on me or the car.</i>

2741
02:03:37,244 --> 02:03:38,328
Jordan?

2742
02:03:38,829 --> 02:03:41,415
Jesus fucking Christ!

2743
02:03:41,498 --> 02:03:43,000
What did you take?

2744
02:03:43,083 --> 02:03:44,376
What's wrong with you?

2745
02:03:44,459 --> 02:03:45,460
Jor!

2746
02:03:45,544 --> 02:03:47,921
It's fucking good, right?

2747
02:03:48,005 --> 02:03:49,339
Fucked up!

2748
02:03:50,674 --> 02:03:52,509
Get off the phone!

2749
02:03:55,554 --> 02:03:57,764
What the fuck, Jordan?

2750
02:03:57,848 --> 02:03:59,433
Your daughter's in the house!

2751
02:03:59,516 --> 02:04:00,601
I hope you know that!

2752
02:04:00,684 --> 02:04:02,019
Your fucking daughter's in the house!

2753
02:04:02,519 --> 02:04:03,854
Yeah, it's real fucking funny, Donnie.

2754
02:04:04,062 --> 02:04:06,481
Get off the phone!

2755
02:04:07,649 --> 02:04:08,609
Jesus Christ, Jordan.

2756
02:04:08,692 --> 02:04:10,360
The FBI!

2757
02:04:11,695 --> 02:04:12,946
Hey!

2758
02:04:13,488 --> 02:04:15,365
I'm on phone!

2759
02:04:15,574 --> 02:04:17,951
Get off the fucking phone!

2760
02:04:19,703 --> 02:04:21,705
- Come here!
- ...the phone.

2761
02:04:23,790 --> 02:04:26,918
Come on. We're gonna
go upstairs, all right.

2762
02:04:31,798 --> 02:04:33,300
I'm on the phone!

2763
02:04:33,383 --> 02:04:34,718
On the phone!

2764
02:04:34,801 --> 02:04:36,887
I know what you did,

2765
02:04:37,387 --> 02:04:38,805
you piece of shit!

2766
02:04:38,889 --> 02:04:40,599
What? What?

2767
02:04:40,682 --> 02:04:42,017
Brad!

2768
02:04:43,727 --> 02:04:45,187
Brad!

2769
02:04:45,687 --> 02:04:46,897
Brad!

2770
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:49,399
You fucking cocksucker!

2771
02:04:53,737 --> 02:04:55,614
What did you do,

2772
02:04:55,697 --> 02:04:57,491
you piece of shit?

2773
02:04:57,574 --> 02:04:58,992
Fuck you!

2774
02:05:00,243 --> 02:05:02,537
I wanna fucking kill you!

2775
02:05:02,621 --> 02:05:04,790
I wanna fucking kill you!

2776
02:05:05,749 --> 02:05:07,084
I got you!

2777
02:05:31,650 --> 02:05:33,568
What the fuck happened?

2778
02:05:34,027 --> 02:05:35,278
Oh, shit!

2779
02:05:35,362 --> 02:05:37,239
Jordan? Jordan, are you all right?

2780
02:05:37,406 --> 02:05:38,990
Donnie? Donnie?

2781
02:05:39,324 --> 02:05:40,409
Donnie?

2782
02:05:40,492 --> 02:05:41,827
Jordan, he's not breathing.

2783
02:05:41,910 --> 02:05:43,704
Oh, fuck, I don't know what to do.

2784
02:05:43,787 --> 02:05:45,038
Jordan, I don't know what the fuck to do!

2785
02:05:45,122 --> 02:05:46,456
I can't help him! Oh, my God. Jordan.

2786
02:05:48,500 --> 02:05:51,044
Oh, my God, I think he's choking,
Jordan. Do something.

2787
02:05:51,128 --> 02:05:52,879
- Oh, God.
- Baby, I got you!

2788
02:05:53,463 --> 02:05:56,341
He's not breathing, Jordan.
You gotta do something!

2789
02:05:57,259 --> 02:05:59,553
Shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

2790
02:06:01,471 --> 02:06:02,806
I got you.

2791
02:06:22,159 --> 02:06:23,744
Step aside!

2792
02:06:23,994 --> 02:06:25,370
Oh, God!

2793
02:06:25,829 --> 02:06:27,289
Oh, God!

2794
02:06:27,664 --> 02:06:29,416
Move aside, baby.

2795
02:06:36,381 --> 02:06:38,175
Come on! Come on!

2796
02:06:38,258 --> 02:06:39,468
Come on!

2797
02:06:44,014 --> 02:06:46,683
Jordan, he's not breathing.
You gotta do something.

2798
02:06:47,726 --> 02:06:49,770
Jordan, he's a father!
He's got fucking kids!

2799
02:06:49,853 --> 02:06:51,521
- Do something!
- Yeah?

2800
02:06:57,194 --> 02:06:58,278
Rocco, you gotta get over here.

2801
02:06:58,361 --> 02:07:00,280
- Come on.
- Call an ambulance!

2802
02:07:00,363 --> 02:07:01,531
I don't fucking know!

2803
02:07:01,615 --> 02:07:03,366
Just get over here! Call 911.

2804
02:07:11,416 --> 02:07:12,417
Yeah.

2805
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:16,296
You all right? He's all right.

2806
02:07:29,476 --> 02:07:31,561
Mr. Belfort?

2807
02:07:32,521 --> 02:07:33,980
Mr. Belfort?

2808
02:07:36,650 --> 02:07:39,569
Get the fuck out of here. Fuck.

2809
02:07:39,653 --> 02:07:42,155
Sir, we need to ask you some questions.

2810
02:07:42,823 --> 02:07:44,783
Are you fucking kidding me? Fuck you.

2811
02:07:44,866 --> 02:07:45,992
Come on, get up.

2812
02:07:46,076 --> 02:07:47,619
Get the fuck out of my house.

2813
02:07:49,412 --> 02:07:51,122
- Let's go.
- I've been here all night.

2814
02:07:51,206 --> 02:07:52,707
I been sitting here all night.

2815
02:07:52,791 --> 02:07:54,167
What the fuck are you talking about?

2816
02:07:54,251 --> 02:07:56,211
- Where you taking him?
- Where you taking me?

2817
02:07:56,294 --> 02:07:57,379
Where you taking him?

2818
02:07:57,462 --> 02:07:58,505
You ain't got no warrant.

2819
02:07:58,588 --> 02:07:59,881
Just come up
in people's house like that!

2820
02:08:01,049 --> 02:08:03,343
Did you drive your car tonight,
Mr. Belfort?

2821
02:08:04,928 --> 02:08:05,971
Well?

2822
02:08:09,266 --> 02:08:10,642
<i>Wow!</i>

2823
02:08:10,934 --> 02:08:12,727
<i>Maybe I hadn't made it home okay.</i>

2824
02:08:27,868 --> 02:08:30,245
Get out of the fucking way!

2825
02:08:32,205 --> 02:08:33,456
Fuck!

2826
02:08:39,087 --> 02:08:42,716
Did you drive that car tonight?

2827
02:08:43,842 --> 02:08:45,969
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right.

2828
02:08:46,052 --> 02:08:47,846
I'm a family man!

2829
02:08:47,929 --> 02:08:49,681
Family man. Honey!

2830
02:08:49,764 --> 02:08:51,725
<i>It was a miracle I wasn't killed,</i>

2831
02:08:51,808 --> 02:08:54,811
<i>or that I didn't kill anybody else.</i>

2832
02:08:54,895 --> 02:08:58,064
<i>The cops took me in for questioning,
but they couldn't charge me.</i>

2833
02:08:58,148 --> 02:09:00,567
<i>They had no proof
I was even behind the wheel.</i>

2834
02:09:00,650 --> 02:09:01,735
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

2835
02:09:01,818 --> 02:09:03,904
<i>Brad did three months
in jail for contempt</i>

2836
02:09:03,987 --> 02:09:06,573
<i>because he wouldn't rat Donnie out.</i>

2837
02:09:06,656 --> 02:09:09,367
<i>The result, I was scot-free.</i>

2838
02:09:09,451 --> 02:09:11,828
<i>But I had eyes on me like never before.</i>

2839
02:09:11,912 --> 02:09:13,580
You're a lucky man, Jordan.

2840
02:09:13,663 --> 02:09:16,583
You're lucky to be alive,
let alone not in jail.

2841
02:09:16,666 --> 02:09:18,251
You know I don't believe in luck, right?

2842
02:09:18,335 --> 02:09:19,669
But it's time.

2843
02:09:19,753 --> 02:09:22,005
Please, let me call the SEC
and cut a deal

2844
02:09:22,088 --> 02:09:24,007
before your luck runs out.

2845
02:09:24,090 --> 02:09:25,675
Wave to Daddy.

2846
02:09:25,759 --> 02:09:26,843
Hey.

2847
02:09:26,927 --> 02:09:28,428
Hey, sweetie.

2848
02:09:33,642 --> 02:09:36,937
What kind of terms
would you be talking about if I...

2849
02:09:37,020 --> 02:09:38,229
I don't know.

2850
02:09:38,313 --> 02:09:41,274
You plead guilty to a handful
of securities violations,

2851
02:09:41,358 --> 02:09:44,402
stock manipulation,
high-pressure sales tactics.

2852
02:09:44,486 --> 02:09:47,280
Ticky-tack shit like that, you know.

2853
02:09:47,364 --> 02:09:49,324
You pay a couple
million dollars in fines,

2854
02:09:49,407 --> 02:09:52,369
in exchange, the SEC
fucks off till the end of time.

2855
02:09:54,704 --> 02:09:56,331
And Stratton?

2856
02:09:56,831 --> 02:09:58,708
What happens to Stratton?

2857
02:09:58,792 --> 02:10:01,628
There's no way... I mean...
You got to walk away. Right?

2858
02:10:01,711 --> 02:10:02,837
Let Donnie be in charge.

2859
02:10:02,921 --> 02:10:04,547
Right. Donnie.

2860
02:10:05,256 --> 02:10:07,425
Now the FBI is
another animal completely.

2861
02:10:07,509 --> 02:10:09,302
They'll still be pursuing you
for criminal wrongdoing.

2862
02:10:09,386 --> 02:10:12,138
However, with you
stepping down voluntarily,

2863
02:10:12,222 --> 02:10:14,140
my guess is that
your best friend Agent Denham

2864
02:10:14,224 --> 02:10:16,559
will be standing around
with his dick in his hand.

2865
02:10:17,686 --> 02:10:18,979
Jordan.

2866
02:10:19,062 --> 02:10:20,981
What do you have to think about?

2867
02:10:21,064 --> 02:10:22,649
You beat them.

2868
02:10:22,732 --> 02:10:23,858
You won!

2869
02:10:23,942 --> 02:10:25,568
God knows you never
have to work again.

2870
02:10:25,652 --> 02:10:27,654
What're you gonna do?
Spend the rest of your life in jail?

2871
02:10:27,737 --> 02:10:28,822
- Is that what you want?
- No.

2872
02:10:28,905 --> 02:10:29,948
- Of course not.
- Okay.

2873
02:10:30,031 --> 02:10:32,075
Okay! You got
all the money in the world.

2874
02:10:32,158 --> 02:10:33,743
You need everybody else's money?

2875
02:10:33,827 --> 02:10:35,245
- Of course not, Pops.
- Well?

2876
02:10:35,328 --> 02:10:37,664
- You know, I built it.
- I know you built it.

2877
02:10:37,747 --> 02:10:39,457
You built it, so now preserve it.

2878
02:11:10,697 --> 02:11:12,115
You know,

2879
02:11:12,490 --> 02:11:15,201
five years ago,
when I started Stratton Oakmont

2880
02:11:15,285 --> 02:11:17,370
with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day

2881
02:11:17,454 --> 02:11:20,749
would eventually come
where I'd have to be moving on.

2882
02:11:22,709 --> 02:11:26,504
And it's truly with a heavy heart
that I'm here to say that...

2883
02:11:28,131 --> 02:11:30,300
That that day is finally here.

2884
02:11:34,512 --> 02:11:36,806
I wanna... I want
to thank you all for your...

2885
02:11:36,890 --> 02:11:39,559
Your years of loyalty and admiration.

2886
02:11:39,642 --> 02:11:41,102
But the point is this.

2887
02:11:42,062 --> 02:11:43,313
Under Donnie's leadership,

2888
02:11:43,396 --> 02:11:46,858
along with Nicky Koskoff
and Robbie Feinberg

2889
02:11:46,941 --> 02:11:49,736
moving into key management positions,
this place really

2890
02:11:49,819 --> 02:11:51,154
is gonna be better than ever!

2891
02:11:51,237 --> 02:11:53,364
That I promise you. Okay?

2892
02:11:53,740 --> 02:11:56,242
Give them a round of applause.
Come on.

2893
02:11:59,329 --> 02:12:02,082
This is Ellis Island here, people.

2894
02:12:02,165 --> 02:12:03,833
I don't care who you are,
where you're from,

2895
02:12:03,917 --> 02:12:06,419
whether your relatives
came over on the fucking <i>Mayflower</i>

2896
02:12:06,503 --> 02:12:08,671
or on an inner tube from Haiti,

2897
02:12:08,755 --> 02:12:11,007
this right here is the land of opportunity.

2898
02:12:11,091 --> 02:12:13,593
Stratton Oakmont is America!

2899
02:12:17,639 --> 02:12:19,265
All of you know Kimmie Belzer, right?

2900
02:12:19,349 --> 02:12:20,558
Yes, we do.

2901
02:12:20,642 --> 02:12:21,768
Fuck you.

2902
02:12:22,435 --> 02:12:23,645
Come on, Kimmie.

2903
02:12:23,728 --> 02:12:25,271
What you probably didn't know is,

2904
02:12:25,355 --> 02:12:27,148
Kimmie was one of
the first brokers here,

2905
02:12:27,232 --> 02:12:29,526
one of Stratton's original 20.

2906
02:12:30,276 --> 02:12:32,112
Now most of you met Kimmie,

2907
02:12:32,195 --> 02:12:35,198
the beautiful sophisticated woman
that she is today.

2908
02:12:35,615 --> 02:12:38,701
A woman that wears
$3,000 Armani suits.

2909
02:12:40,703 --> 02:12:43,248
Who drives a brand-new
Mercedes-Benz.

2910
02:12:43,957 --> 02:12:45,792
A woman who spends

2911
02:12:45,875 --> 02:12:47,293
her winters in the Bahamas

2912
02:12:47,377 --> 02:12:49,504
and summers in the Hamptons!

2913
02:12:54,509 --> 02:12:56,845
That's not the Kimmie that I met.

2914
02:12:59,681 --> 02:13:03,434
The Kimmie that I met
didn't have two nickels to rub together.

2915
02:13:04,686 --> 02:13:06,938
She was a single mom
on the balls of her ass

2916
02:13:07,021 --> 02:13:08,815
with an eight-year-old son.

2917
02:13:08,898 --> 02:13:11,901
Okay? She was
three months behind on her rent.

2918
02:13:12,986 --> 02:13:16,656
And when she came to me
and asked me for a job,

2919
02:13:16,739 --> 02:13:18,950
she asked for a $5,000 advance

2920
02:13:19,033 --> 02:13:22,203
just so she could pay her son's tuition.

2921
02:13:26,666 --> 02:13:28,376
And what'd I do, Kimmie?

2922
02:13:28,459 --> 02:13:30,170
Go on, tell them.

2923
02:13:31,921 --> 02:13:33,965
You wrote me a check

2924
02:13:34,215 --> 02:13:36,301
for $25,000.

2925
02:13:37,594 --> 02:13:39,053
That's right.

2926
02:13:39,179 --> 02:13:40,513
Thank you.

2927
02:13:43,933 --> 02:13:45,685
And you know why that is?

2928
02:13:49,022 --> 02:13:51,316
It's because I believed in you.

2929
02:13:53,026 --> 02:13:55,737
It's because I believed in you, Kimmie,

2930
02:13:56,154 --> 02:14:00,033
just like I believe in each
and every one of you here today.

2931
02:14:00,116 --> 02:14:02,535
- I fucking love you, Jordan!
- I fucking love you.

2932
02:14:02,619 --> 02:14:04,412
I fucking love you! I love you.

2933
02:14:04,495 --> 02:14:07,290
I fucking love you, too!
I fucking love you, too!

2934
02:14:10,210 --> 02:14:12,212
And I love all of you!

2935
02:14:12,795 --> 02:14:15,131
And I love all of you
from the bottom of my heart.

2936
02:14:15,215 --> 02:14:17,675
- I fucking love you, too.
- I mean that.

2937
02:14:18,509 --> 02:14:20,803
You are the shit.
You are the fucking shit.

2938
02:14:27,310 --> 02:14:29,479
It's a shame, you know.

2939
02:14:31,064 --> 02:14:35,193
For years, I've been telling you guys
never to take no for an answer, right?

2940
02:14:35,276 --> 02:14:38,488
You know, to keep pushing,
to never hang up the phone

2941
02:14:39,405 --> 02:14:41,658
until you get what you want.

2942
02:14:42,533 --> 02:14:44,285
Because you all deserve it.

2943
02:14:46,329 --> 02:14:49,499
You know, this fucking deal
that I'm about to sign

2944
02:14:49,999 --> 02:14:52,126
barring me from the securities industry,

2945
02:14:52,210 --> 02:14:54,254
barring me from Stratton,

2946
02:14:55,338 --> 02:14:56,756
my home.

2947
02:14:59,509 --> 02:15:01,511
What the fuck is that, you know?

2948
02:15:02,720 --> 02:15:05,056
I'll tell you what it is. It's...

2949
02:15:05,807 --> 02:15:08,601
It's me taking no
for an answer, you know.

2950
02:15:10,103 --> 02:15:11,354
It's them...

2951
02:15:11,437 --> 02:15:14,691
It's them selling me,
not the other way around.

2952
02:15:15,441 --> 02:15:18,152
It's me being a hypocrite is what it is.

2953
02:15:23,324 --> 02:15:24,575
So...

2954
02:15:31,708 --> 02:15:33,251
You know what?

2955
02:15:37,046 --> 02:15:38,673
I'm not leaving.

2956
02:15:41,009 --> 02:15:42,260
I'm not leaving.

2957
02:15:45,221 --> 02:15:46,389
I'm not fucking leaving!

2958
02:15:51,436 --> 02:15:53,855
You're not getting a fucking promotion!

2959
02:15:55,231 --> 02:15:56,566
The show goes on!

2960
02:15:59,193 --> 02:16:00,611
This is my home!

2961
02:16:00,695 --> 02:16:03,448
They're gonna need
a fucking wrecking ball

2962
02:16:03,531 --> 02:16:05,408
to take me out of here!

2963
02:16:07,410 --> 02:16:09,912
They're gonna need to
send in the National Guard

2964
02:16:09,996 --> 02:16:11,748
or fucking SWAT team

2965
02:16:11,831 --> 02:16:14,334
'cause I ain't going nowhere!

2966
02:16:17,170 --> 02:16:18,212
Fuck them!

2967
02:16:20,673 --> 02:16:22,425
Fuck them!

2968
02:16:56,542 --> 02:16:58,336
Jordy! Jordy!

2969
02:16:58,461 --> 02:17:00,463
Jordy! Get back here!

2970
02:17:01,297 --> 02:17:02,465
Hey!

2971
02:17:04,926 --> 02:17:06,177
Give me that.

2972
02:17:08,679 --> 02:17:09,806
What is this?

2973
02:17:09,889 --> 02:17:12,392
<i>Ramar of the Jungle,</i> for Christ sake?

2974
02:17:13,476 --> 02:17:16,396
<i>Paddy D,</i> mazel tov, <i>you Irishman.</i>

2975
02:17:16,479 --> 02:17:19,941
<i>Jordan Belfort just welched
on his deal with the SEC.</i>

2976
02:17:20,024 --> 02:17:22,693
<i>He is back in the ocean. Happy hunting.</i>

2977
02:17:35,623 --> 02:17:37,917
<i>It was our time to party big.</i>

2978
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,628
<i>And just as Brad
was released from jail, too.</i>

2979
02:17:41,462 --> 02:17:45,425
<i>I apologized, even offered to
pay him for his time in the can.</i>

2980
02:17:46,008 --> 02:17:48,094
<i>But he said no, that he was out.</i>

2981
02:17:48,177 --> 02:17:50,054
<i>He didn't want any part of us.</i>

2982
02:17:50,138 --> 02:17:51,764
<i>Sad thing was,</i>

2983
02:17:51,848 --> 02:17:55,059
<i>two years later he was dead.</i>

2984
02:17:55,226 --> 02:17:57,645
<i>Massive heart attack. Thirty-five.</i>

2985
02:17:58,438 --> 02:18:00,773
<i>Same age Mozart died.</i>

2986
02:18:00,857 --> 02:18:04,110
<i>Not that they have a hell
of a lot in common, but...</i>

2987
02:18:04,193 --> 02:18:06,529
<i>Anyway, I don't know
why that came to mind.</i>

2988
02:18:08,698 --> 02:18:12,285
<i>Within days, subpoenas started flying.</i>

2989
02:18:12,368 --> 02:18:15,705
<i>Notices to produce documents,
depositions, you name it.</i>

2990
02:18:15,788 --> 02:18:17,790
<i>Donnie couldn't drink water fast enough.</i>

2991
02:18:17,874 --> 02:18:20,334
United States government
wants to give me a subpoena?

2992
02:18:20,418 --> 02:18:23,713
Here's what we do
with subpoenas at Stratton Oakmont!

2993
02:18:29,469 --> 02:18:32,096
Fuck you, USA! Fuck you!

2994
02:18:32,180 --> 02:18:34,056
Fuck you! Fuck you!

2995
02:18:34,140 --> 02:18:35,933
Fuck you!

2996
02:18:43,691 --> 02:18:45,735
Jordan Belfort.

2997
02:18:45,818 --> 02:18:47,695
Alden. That's a nice name.

2998
02:18:47,778 --> 02:18:49,071
Thank you very much for that.

2999
02:18:49,155 --> 02:18:51,324
- What kind of name is that?
- That is my name.

3000
02:18:51,407 --> 02:18:53,075
I do not recall that.

3001
02:18:53,159 --> 02:18:55,495
I do not recall that. Okay?

3002
02:18:55,578 --> 02:18:57,747
Mr. Ming, thank you for coming in today.

3003
02:18:57,830 --> 02:18:59,457
Are you gonna finish
the rest of that Danish?

3004
02:18:59,540 --> 02:19:00,750
- Can I have that Danish?
- No, no, go ahead.

3005
02:19:00,833 --> 02:19:02,502
<i>They interrogated everybody.</i>

3006
02:19:02,585 --> 02:19:04,212
I got a low blood sugar, thyroid thing.

3007
02:19:04,295 --> 02:19:05,463
<i>It went on for months.</i>

3008
02:19:05,546 --> 02:19:07,590
<i>It was a total fucking harassment.</i>

3009
02:19:07,673 --> 02:19:09,217
Tell him to proceed with the questions.

3010
02:19:09,300 --> 02:19:11,761
<i>But not a single Strattonite cracked.</i>

3011
02:19:11,844 --> 02:19:13,513
Gladys Carrera?

3012
02:19:13,596 --> 02:19:15,139
Doesn't ring a bell.

3013
02:19:15,223 --> 02:19:17,850
Sorry, I have
no recommendation of that.

3014
02:19:18,017 --> 02:19:19,018
No.

3015
02:19:19,101 --> 02:19:20,102
No idea.

3016
02:19:20,186 --> 02:19:22,688
I don't recall that transaction.
You guys have any milk?

3017
02:19:22,772 --> 02:19:25,024
Absolutely not.

3018
02:19:25,107 --> 02:19:26,943
Francis Sortigi
you called so many times

3019
02:19:27,026 --> 02:19:29,237
I just thought you might remember that.

3020
02:19:29,320 --> 02:19:30,821
<i>Would you remember any of those?</i>

3021
02:19:30,905 --> 02:19:32,657
- I do not recall any of that.
- This Abdul...

3022
02:19:32,740 --> 02:19:34,909
I do not... No, I don't recall.

3023
02:19:34,992 --> 02:19:36,661
It was a long phone call.

3024
02:19:36,744 --> 02:19:38,412
I just wondered if you have
any memory of that.

3025
02:19:38,496 --> 02:19:41,666
Okay. You know we've talked to
several of the employees at this firm

3026
02:19:41,749 --> 02:19:45,044
and nobody can recall anything
about this Steve Madden IPO.

3027
02:19:45,127 --> 02:19:46,379
I think it's odd.

3028
02:19:48,256 --> 02:19:50,758
Do you recall Cartage Corporation?

3029
02:19:52,260 --> 02:19:53,511
You do recall it?

3030
02:19:53,594 --> 02:19:54,887
No, I don't recall that at all.

3031
02:19:55,471 --> 02:19:58,391
Excuse me. I have to ask.
Is that your real hair?

3032
02:19:59,016 --> 02:20:01,143
Are you gonna say anything about that?

3033
02:20:01,227 --> 02:20:02,520
Are you gonna comment on my hair?

3034
02:20:02,603 --> 02:20:04,313
Is that how we're doing...
Is this personal questions?

3035
02:20:04,397 --> 02:20:06,065
I'm just wondering why you would
wear something like that.

3036
02:20:06,148 --> 02:20:07,984
Sorry. I don't recall that company.

3037
02:20:10,069 --> 02:20:11,821
Can I get you anything else, gentlemen?

3038
02:20:11,904 --> 02:20:13,739
Yes. Sweetheart, I have a rare condition

3039
02:20:13,823 --> 02:20:17,243
which requires me to drink one of those
every 15 minutes, please.

3040
02:20:17,702 --> 02:20:20,830
<i>We were specifically advised
not to leave the country.</i>

3041
02:20:20,913 --> 02:20:22,957
<i>So, we took our wives to Italy.</i>

3042
02:20:23,332 --> 02:20:25,751
<i>We figured we were safer
working from overseas</i>

3043
02:20:25,835 --> 02:20:27,211
<i>giving orders to Rugrat.</i>

3044
02:20:27,295 --> 02:20:29,463
<i>Nobody could arrest us
and nobody could prove</i>

3045
02:20:29,547 --> 02:20:31,549
<i>I was still running Stratton from a yacht.</i>

3046
02:20:31,632 --> 02:20:32,883
Hey, Rugrat.

3047
02:20:32,967 --> 02:20:34,135
<i>Bonjour.</i>

3048
02:20:34,218 --> 02:20:36,220
You bald-headed eagle, how you doing?

3049
02:20:36,304 --> 02:20:37,263
<i>Donnie, Donnie, listen!</i>

3050
02:20:37,346 --> 02:20:38,639
We have a problem, okay.

3051
02:20:38,723 --> 02:20:41,976
Your friend, Steve Madden,
is unloading shares.

3052
02:20:42,059 --> 02:20:44,103
What are you saying?
Who told you that?

3053
02:20:44,186 --> 02:20:45,771
- What's going on?
- <i>He's doing it, Donnie!</i>

3054
02:20:45,855 --> 02:20:48,316
He said that
Steve Madden's unloading shares.

3055
02:20:48,399 --> 02:20:49,525
Who told you that? It's bullshit!

3056
02:20:49,609 --> 02:20:51,944
Give me that goddamn phone.

3057
02:20:52,028 --> 02:20:53,571
What's going on?

3058
02:20:53,779 --> 02:20:55,865
Jordan, look. I'm watching the screen

3059
02:20:55,948 --> 02:20:58,659
and huge chunks of Steve Madden
are being sold, okay.

3060
02:20:58,743 --> 02:21:00,786
It's not coming from us,
so it's gotta be Steve.

3061
02:21:00,870 --> 02:21:02,913
He's the only person
with that many shares.

3062
02:21:02,997 --> 02:21:03,956
It's Donnie. Call me back, all right.

3063
02:21:04,040 --> 02:21:06,375
Donnie, your little friend
is trying to fuck me, you know that.

3064
02:21:06,500 --> 02:21:08,210
Your little friend is trying to
fuck me right in the ass.

3065
02:21:08,294 --> 02:21:09,879
- Get him on the phone now!
- We don't know anything yet.

3066
02:21:09,962 --> 02:21:11,339
Let's not jump to conclusions.

3067
02:21:11,839 --> 02:21:13,549
<i>Even though I owned 85%</i>

3068
02:21:13,633 --> 02:21:16,677
<i>of Steve-cock sucking-
motherfucking-Madden Shoes,</i>

3069
02:21:16,761 --> 02:21:19,013
<i>the shares were in his fucking name.</i>

3070
02:21:19,096 --> 02:21:21,307
<i>This motherfucker knew
I was in trouble with the feds</i>

3071
02:21:21,390 --> 02:21:23,184
<i>and was trying to take advantage.</i>

3072
02:21:23,267 --> 02:21:24,769
Talk to me, man.
How do you wanna play this?

3073
02:21:24,852 --> 02:21:26,604
I want you to get
all our clients on the phone right now

3074
02:21:26,687 --> 02:21:27,980
and have them start
selling Steve Madden.

3075
02:21:28,064 --> 02:21:29,523
We're gonna drive
that fucking price down!

3076
02:21:29,607 --> 02:21:31,108
Do you hear me? Shut the fuck up!

3077
02:21:31,233 --> 02:21:32,860
This is your fucking friend
from high school.

3078
02:21:33,027 --> 02:21:35,112
<i>If that little fucking prick
thinks he can fuck with me,</i>

3079
02:21:35,196 --> 02:21:37,782
we'll turn his company
into a penny stock! You hear me?

3080
02:21:37,865 --> 02:21:39,283
- You got it?
- Yes. I got it!

3081
02:21:39,367 --> 02:21:42,286
<i>Let's just not jump to conclusions
before we know what's going on.</i>

3082
02:21:42,370 --> 02:21:43,746
Captain Ted!

3083
02:21:43,829 --> 02:21:44,914
Captain Ted!

3084
02:21:45,414 --> 02:21:47,792
Hang up your phones! Everybody, hey!

3085
02:21:47,875 --> 02:21:50,628
Turn the boat around!
We're going home!

3086
02:21:53,756 --> 02:21:56,133
Baby! Baby, what happened?

3087
02:21:56,425 --> 02:21:57,677
I just...

3088
02:21:58,094 --> 02:21:59,345
Sweetheart, what's going on?

3089
02:22:00,471 --> 02:22:02,098
Aunt Emma...

3090
02:22:02,973 --> 02:22:04,266
Just wait.

3091
02:22:04,684 --> 02:22:06,310
I can't...

3092
02:22:06,394 --> 02:22:09,271
What's going on? Why you crying?

3093
02:22:09,355 --> 02:22:11,399
- She's dead!
- Who? Who's dead?

3094
02:22:11,482 --> 02:22:13,859
I just got a call from my cousin Betty.

3095
02:22:13,943 --> 02:22:15,027
Yeah?

3096
02:22:15,111 --> 02:22:16,821
Aunt Emma is dead.

3097
02:22:18,239 --> 02:22:20,950
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.

3098
02:22:21,283 --> 02:22:22,451
You're serious?

3099
02:22:23,244 --> 02:22:25,538
Oh, my God! Baby, that's...

3100
02:22:25,621 --> 02:22:27,081
Oh, fuck!

3101
02:22:27,164 --> 02:22:28,958
Oh, sweetheart, that's just...

3102
02:22:29,041 --> 02:22:30,376
<i>Fucking heart attack!</i>

3103
02:22:30,459 --> 02:22:32,044
<i>Boom, snap, gone.</i>

3104
02:22:32,128 --> 02:22:33,963
<i>Shuffled off her mortal coil.</i>

3105
02:22:34,046 --> 02:22:37,383
<i>And $20 million stuck
in a Swiss bank account.</i>

3106
02:22:37,466 --> 02:22:39,552
The last time I talked
to her she was fine!

3107
02:22:39,635 --> 02:22:41,804
- She's not that old.
- Oh, God! Baby, oh, God!

3108
02:22:41,887 --> 02:22:44,056
That's so fucking terrible!

3109
02:22:44,140 --> 02:22:45,850
Oh, fuck!

3110
02:22:45,933 --> 02:22:46,934
It is terrible.

3111
02:22:47,017 --> 02:22:49,562
Your aunt was such an elegant,
attractive woman.

3112
02:22:49,645 --> 02:22:51,564
My condolences to you and your family.

3113
02:22:51,647 --> 02:22:52,982
Yes. We're absolutely devastated.

3114
02:22:53,065 --> 02:22:55,067
Thank you so much
for your condolences.

3115
02:22:55,151 --> 02:22:58,070
Now where does that leave us
in regard to her account exactly?

3116
02:22:58,154 --> 02:22:59,655
Does it go into probate or what?

3117
02:22:59,739 --> 02:23:01,323
Not to worry, Jordan. Not to worry.

3118
02:23:01,407 --> 02:23:03,075
Your aunt, before she died,

3119
02:23:03,159 --> 02:23:06,078
signed a document
naming you as her successor.

3120
02:23:06,328 --> 02:23:07,830
She did?

3121
02:23:07,913 --> 02:23:09,540
Fantastic! Well, that's good news!

3122
02:23:09,832 --> 02:23:12,001
Well, not as of yet.

3123
02:23:12,334 --> 02:23:14,336
What does that mean? Not as of yet?

3124
02:23:16,756 --> 02:23:18,466
I can't seem to hear you.

3125
02:23:18,549 --> 02:23:21,260
I must have bad reception.
Are you speaking English?

3126
02:23:21,427 --> 02:23:24,096
- Very... Now. Fast. Very fast.
- <i>Fast?</i>

3127
02:23:24,180 --> 02:23:26,307
I have to get to Switzerland now?

3128
02:23:28,017 --> 02:23:30,102
Speak English! Fucking speak English!

3129
02:23:30,186 --> 02:23:31,479
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Quiet, okay?

3130
02:23:31,562 --> 02:23:33,022
Take your suit, take your dick, okay,

3131
02:23:33,105 --> 02:23:34,815
- and move your ass! Please.
- <i>Okay.</i>

3132
02:23:35,858 --> 02:23:36,901
Move my ass! Yes!

3133
02:23:36,984 --> 02:23:41,113
<i>I gotta say, these Swiss were
some sneaky motherfuckers.</i>

3134
02:23:41,197 --> 02:23:43,115
<i>Within minutes,
he had me set up with a forger</i>

3135
02:23:43,199 --> 02:23:45,201
<i>who could fake Aunt Emma's signature.</i>

3136
02:23:45,284 --> 02:23:46,827
You American shit!

3137
02:23:46,994 --> 02:23:50,372
<i>I just had to get there by tomorrow,
or lose $20 million.</i>

3138
02:23:50,456 --> 02:23:52,166
We're going to Monaco!

3139
02:23:52,708 --> 02:23:55,002
- Monaco? Now?
- Yes, baby.

3140
02:23:55,085 --> 02:23:57,671
We're going to Monaco,
so then we can go to Switzerland, okay?

3141
02:23:57,755 --> 02:23:59,465
- But her aunt just died.
- I realize that.

3142
02:23:59,548 --> 02:24:02,468
But I have business in Switzerland.
I need to go to Switzerland right now.

3143
02:24:02,551 --> 02:24:04,637
Bottom line. Sorry.

3144
02:24:04,929 --> 02:24:06,722
We gotta get to London.

3145
02:24:07,223 --> 02:24:08,474
Why? Why?

3146
02:24:09,975 --> 02:24:11,143
The funeral!

3147
02:24:11,227 --> 02:24:12,561
Yeah, but, babe. Look, look...

3148
02:24:13,062 --> 02:24:15,815
I loved your aunt
more than anyone in the entire world.

3149
02:24:15,898 --> 02:24:17,399
I really did.

3150
02:24:17,900 --> 02:24:20,152
But she's dead now, sweetie.

3151
02:24:20,236 --> 02:24:22,446
She's dead
and she's not going anywhere.

3152
02:24:22,530 --> 02:24:24,907
She'll still be dead by the time
we get to London, okay?

3153
02:24:25,574 --> 02:24:27,326
Captain Ted!
Captain Ted, all right, look.

3154
02:24:27,409 --> 02:24:29,203
We're going to Monaco.
Monaco now, okay?

3155
02:24:29,286 --> 02:24:30,329
Monaco, right.

3156
02:24:30,412 --> 02:24:32,289
We're going to Monaco
so that we can drive to Switzerland

3157
02:24:32,373 --> 02:24:33,666
so they don't stamp our passports.

3158
02:24:33,749 --> 02:24:35,626
Take care of business here,
we'll drive back to Monaco,

3159
02:24:35,709 --> 02:24:37,378
take a flight over to London
to catch the funeral

3160
02:24:37,461 --> 02:24:38,963
and be in New York
in three fucking business days!

3161
02:24:39,046 --> 02:24:40,214
That's the fucking plan.

3162
02:24:40,297 --> 02:24:42,675
I just want you to know that
we might run into some chop.

3163
02:24:42,758 --> 02:24:44,969
Chop? We can fucking
handle chop, right?

3164
02:24:45,052 --> 02:24:46,470
I mean, it's a 170-foot yacht.

3165
02:24:46,554 --> 02:24:49,306
No, no, no. We're not going anywhere
unless he says it's safe, all right.

3166
02:24:49,390 --> 02:24:50,808
- Don't worry about the chop.
- It's safe.

3167
02:24:50,891 --> 02:24:52,226
You don't know shit about chop.

3168
02:24:52,309 --> 02:24:54,520
Oh, really? And you do?
You're a fucking expert on that.

3169
02:24:54,603 --> 02:24:56,939
I'll chop your fucking credit card in half.
How about that?

3170
02:24:57,022 --> 02:24:58,899
Chop is fine. Trust me. Chop is fine.

3171
02:24:58,983 --> 02:25:00,693
Is chop fine, Captain Ted?

3172
02:25:02,027 --> 02:25:03,863
Yeah. I mean, if we take it slow.

3173
02:25:03,946 --> 02:25:05,114
Yeah, we're gonna take it slow.

3174
02:25:05,197 --> 02:25:06,782
It's a little uncomfortable.
Tell them it's safe.

3175
02:25:06,866 --> 02:25:08,033
It's gonna be safe.

3176
02:25:08,117 --> 02:25:11,704
We'll batten down the hatches
and secure the deck.

3177
02:25:11,787 --> 02:25:15,499
And we're looking at a few...
Maybe a few broken dishes.

3178
02:25:15,583 --> 02:25:16,709
Few broken dishes.

3179
02:25:16,792 --> 02:25:18,002
What's a few broken dishes?

3180
02:25:18,085 --> 02:25:19,378
Does that sound fucking awesome
or what?

3181
02:25:19,461 --> 02:25:20,838
No. Not really.

3182
02:25:20,921 --> 02:25:22,214
We're gonna have a fucking good time!

3183
02:25:22,298 --> 02:25:24,049
Let's go to fucking Monaco now!

3184
02:25:24,133 --> 02:25:25,301
Let's fucking move! Let's go!

3185
02:25:30,723 --> 02:25:31,765
Hold on!

3186
02:25:34,935 --> 02:25:37,938
What the fuck is going on out here?

3187
02:25:38,022 --> 02:25:40,649
The Jet Skis just went overboard!

3188
02:25:40,733 --> 02:25:42,735
Oh, Jesus Christ! Honey, you okay?

3189
02:25:42,818 --> 02:25:44,945
<i>Gale warning! Gale warning!</i>

3190
02:25:45,029 --> 02:25:47,823
The waves are
20 feet high and building!

3191
02:25:47,907 --> 02:25:49,575
Turn around, let's go
the other fucking way.

3192
02:25:49,658 --> 02:25:50,868
- We can't!
- Go!

3193
02:25:50,951 --> 02:25:53,537
We'll get broad-sided. It'll tip over!

3194
02:25:53,621 --> 02:25:55,414
I am a master diver. You hear that?

3195
02:25:55,497 --> 02:25:56,540
I'm a master diver!

3196
02:25:56,624 --> 02:25:57,875
No one's gonna fucking die!

3197
02:25:57,958 --> 02:26:00,586
I got you, baby. I got you.
Trust me, okay?

3198
02:26:00,669 --> 02:26:01,921
I love you.

3199
02:26:02,004 --> 02:26:03,923
I love you, baby. Just hold on tight.

3200
02:26:04,006 --> 02:26:05,049
Okay.

3201
02:26:05,132 --> 02:26:06,175
Donnie!

3202
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:08,969
Hold on, baby!

3203
02:26:09,053 --> 02:26:10,054
Donnie!

3204
02:26:12,097 --> 02:26:13,140
Donnie!

3205
02:26:13,641 --> 02:26:15,017
- What?
- Hold on, baby.

3206
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:16,602
Get the fucking ludes.

3207
02:26:16,685 --> 02:26:17,853
I don't wanna die, Jordan!

3208
02:26:17,937 --> 02:26:20,648
I did a lot of bad shit.
I'm going to hell, Jordan!

3209
02:26:20,731 --> 02:26:23,609
I fucked up! I fucked up so bad!

3210
02:26:23,692 --> 02:26:25,694
Get the ludes! Downstairs!

3211
02:26:25,903 --> 02:26:27,112
What are you saying?

3212
02:26:27,613 --> 02:26:29,031
Fuck!

3213
02:26:29,907 --> 02:26:31,116
Get the ludes!

3214
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:32,785
I can't go down there, Jordan.
It's flooded.

3215
02:26:32,868 --> 02:26:34,119
It's three feet of water down there!

3216
02:26:34,203 --> 02:26:36,956
I will not die sober!

3217
02:26:37,039 --> 02:26:38,791
Get those fucking ludes!

3218
02:26:38,874 --> 02:26:39,917
Okay!

3219
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,335
- Go!
- Okay.

3220
02:26:44,213 --> 02:26:45,965
- Where's he going?
- Hold on, baby!

3221
02:26:46,048 --> 02:26:47,633
Donnie! Is he fucking crazy?

3222
02:26:47,716 --> 02:26:48,842
He's just warning everybody!

3223
02:27:01,063 --> 02:27:02,773
Jesus Christ!

3224
02:27:04,358 --> 02:27:05,526
Hold on!

3225
02:27:05,609 --> 02:27:07,069
Get away from the window!

3226
02:27:07,152 --> 02:27:08,529
Rogue wave!

3227
02:27:08,612 --> 02:27:09,655
Mayday!

3228
02:27:09,738 --> 02:27:12,324
This is Captain Ted Beecham
aboard the yacht <i>Naomi!</i>

3229
02:27:12,408 --> 02:27:13,909
- We are going down!
- I got 'em!

3230
02:27:14,368 --> 02:27:15,577
I got 'em!

3231
02:27:16,745 --> 02:27:18,288
Give me one for the nerves!

3232
02:27:18,372 --> 02:27:19,498
We're going down!

3233
02:27:19,581 --> 02:27:21,792
This is a fucking Mayday!

3234
02:27:21,875 --> 02:27:23,961
We require immediate assistance!

3235
02:27:26,213 --> 02:27:27,214
Hold on!

3236
02:27:27,297 --> 02:27:28,507
Watch out!

3237
02:27:40,185 --> 02:27:42,730
<i>The nice thing about
getting rescued by Italians</i>

3238
02:27:43,022 --> 02:27:46,567
<i>is that they feed you,
make you drink red wine,</i>

3239
02:27:46,650 --> 02:27:48,610
<i>then you get to dance.</i>

3240
02:28:05,210 --> 02:28:06,879
<i>Did you see that?</i>

3241
02:28:07,296 --> 02:28:10,215
<i>That was the plane
I sent to come get us.</i>

3242
02:28:11,133 --> 02:28:14,887
<i>I shit you not, it exploded
when a seagull flew into the engine.</i>

3243
02:28:14,970 --> 02:28:16,972
<i>Three people killed.</i>

3244
02:28:21,143 --> 02:28:22,978
<i>You want a sign from God?</i>

3245
02:28:23,062 --> 02:28:26,148
<i>Well, after all this,
I finally got the message.</i>

3246
02:28:31,612 --> 02:28:35,240
<i>Do you dream of becoming
financially independent</i>

3247
02:28:35,324 --> 02:28:37,993
but struggle every month
just to pay your bills?

3248
02:28:38,077 --> 02:28:42,164
Would you like to own a home like this,
but can barely afford to pay your rent?

3249
02:28:42,247 --> 02:28:45,959
My name is Jordan Belfort,
and there's no secret to wealth creation.

3250
02:28:46,043 --> 02:28:48,545
No matter who you are,
no matter where you came from,

3251
02:28:48,629 --> 02:28:51,215
you too can become
financially independent

3252
02:28:51,298 --> 02:28:53,050
in just a matter of months.

3253
02:28:53,133 --> 02:28:55,260
All you need is a strategy.

3254
02:28:55,344 --> 02:28:56,970
When I was 24 years old,

3255
02:28:57,054 --> 02:29:00,891
I made a decision
not just to survive, but to thrive.

3256
02:29:00,974 --> 02:29:03,435
<i>At first I didn't feel like
deals like these were possible.</i>

3257
02:29:03,519 --> 02:29:06,939
But we have the house
and we have a $33,000 profit.

3258
02:29:07,022 --> 02:29:08,148
I certainly believe now.

3259
02:29:08,232 --> 02:29:09,650
Think about it for a second.

3260
02:29:09,733 --> 02:29:11,860
If you don't have the guts
to attend Jordan Belfort's

3261
02:29:11,944 --> 02:29:14,113
Straight Line Persuasion
System seminar,

3262
02:29:14,196 --> 02:29:15,781
then how do you expect
to make any money?

3263
02:29:15,864 --> 02:29:19,618
<i>If you want to be a millionaire someday,
have some guts. Make a decision.</i>

3264
02:29:19,701 --> 02:29:22,454
Jordan Belfort's setup worked for me
because I worked hard for it.

3265
02:29:22,538 --> 02:29:25,082
And if it doesn't work for you,
it's because you're lazy.

3266
02:29:25,165 --> 02:29:26,792
And you should get a job at McDonald's.

3267
02:29:26,875 --> 02:29:29,294
<i>There's nobody holding you back
from financial freedom.</i>

3268
02:29:29,378 --> 02:29:32,297
And there's nobody stopping you
from making millions.

3269
02:29:32,381 --> 02:29:33,632
Don't just sit at home,

3270
02:29:33,715 --> 02:29:36,343
or the life of your dreams
will sail right past you.

3271
02:29:39,096 --> 02:29:42,724
I changed all these people's lives
and I can change yours, too!

3272
02:29:42,808 --> 02:29:44,059
So come to my seminar!

3273
02:29:44,143 --> 02:29:45,519
The life of your dreams is only...

3274
02:29:45,602 --> 02:29:47,312
Good to see you again, Jordan.

3275
02:29:47,396 --> 02:29:48,480
You're under arrest!

3276
02:29:48,564 --> 02:29:50,149
You gotta be joking!

3277
02:29:51,400 --> 02:29:52,651
You're kidding me.

3278
02:29:52,734 --> 02:29:54,319
Hey, get the fuck away from me!

3279
02:29:54,403 --> 02:29:55,654
Turn that camera off.

3280
02:29:55,737 --> 02:29:57,739
I'm fucking shooting
a fucking infomercial here,

3281
02:29:57,823 --> 02:29:59,199
you fucking cocksucker!

3282
02:29:59,283 --> 02:30:00,993
- Fuck you, you motherfucker!
- Shut the fucking camera off.

3283
02:30:01,076 --> 02:30:02,828
You don't got shit on me, you hear me!

3284
02:30:02,911 --> 02:30:03,996
Go fuck yourself!

3285
02:30:04,079 --> 02:30:06,456
I'm making an honest living,
you fucking piece of shit!

3286
02:30:06,540 --> 02:30:09,501
Hey, Jordan,
let me give you a little legal advice.

3287
02:30:09,585 --> 02:30:11,003
Shut the fuck up!

3288
02:30:11,086 --> 02:30:12,629
Oh, fuck you, you fucking prick!

3289
02:30:12,713 --> 02:30:15,257
I'm making an honest living,
you motherfucker!

3290
02:30:17,092 --> 02:30:18,510
<i>I clean up my act.</i>

3291
02:30:18,594 --> 02:30:21,180
<i>I did rehab. I'm a TV personality.</i>

3292
02:30:21,263 --> 02:30:24,016
<i>I'm sober for two years.
And this happens!</i>

3293
02:30:24,099 --> 02:30:26,310
<i>Rugrat goes
and gets busted down in Miami.</i>

3294
02:30:26,393 --> 02:30:27,644
I'm Swiss, I'm not communist.

3295
02:30:27,728 --> 02:30:29,396
<i>And guess who the fuck with? Saurel.</i>

3296
02:30:29,479 --> 02:30:30,522
- You gonna beat me?
- No, sir.

3297
02:30:30,606 --> 02:30:32,858
Yeah, I know your country.
You're gonna beat me.

3298
02:30:32,941 --> 02:30:34,693
<i>I mean, what are the fucking odds?</i>

3299
02:30:34,776 --> 02:30:37,404
<i>There had to be 10,000
Swiss bankers in Geneva,</i>

3300
02:30:37,487 --> 02:30:41,283
<i>and Rugrat gets the one dumb enough
to get himself arrested on U.S. soil.</i>

3301
02:30:41,366 --> 02:30:42,743
I know.

3302
02:30:42,868 --> 02:30:44,244
I'm so sorry.

3303
02:30:46,455 --> 02:30:47,664
<i>Even more fucked</i>

3304
02:30:47,748 --> 02:30:50,876
<i>was that he got busted
for shit that had nothing to do with me.</i>

3305
02:30:50,959 --> 02:30:52,544
<i>It had nothing to fucking do with me.</i>

3306
02:30:52,628 --> 02:30:54,588
<i>Something about laundering drug money</i>

3307
02:30:54,671 --> 02:30:57,758
<i>through offshore boat racing
and a guy named Rocky Aoki,</i>

3308
02:30:57,841 --> 02:30:59,968
<i>you know, the founder of Benihana.</i>

3309
02:31:00,052 --> 02:31:01,386
<i>Benihana.</i>

3310
02:31:01,470 --> 02:31:03,138
<i>Beni-fucking-Hana!</i>

3311
02:31:03,597 --> 02:31:05,349
<i>Beni-fucking-Hana!</i>

3312
02:31:05,432 --> 02:31:06,391
<i>Why?</i>

3313
02:31:06,475 --> 02:31:07,851
<i>Why, why, God?</i>

3314
02:31:07,935 --> 02:31:09,394
<i>Why would you be so cruel</i>

3315
02:31:09,478 --> 02:31:12,064
<i>as to choose
a chain of fucking hibachi restaurants</i>

3316
02:31:12,147 --> 02:31:13,398
<i>to take me down?</i>

3317
02:31:15,817 --> 02:31:18,278
<i>Long story short. Saurel rats me out.</i>

3318
02:31:18,362 --> 02:31:21,490
<i>But not before he rats out
Brad's wife, Chantalle,</i>

3319
02:31:21,573 --> 02:31:25,661
<i>who, it turns out, he'd been fucking
every time she went to Switzerland!</i>

3320
02:31:27,663 --> 02:31:30,165
- No, no, no, it's impossible.
- <i>Oui, oui, oui.</i>

3321
02:31:32,376 --> 02:31:34,169
All right!

3322
02:31:34,253 --> 02:31:37,756
<i>One count engaging in conspiracy
to commit securities fraud.</i>

3323
02:31:37,839 --> 02:31:40,050
<i>Two counts securities fraud.</i>

3324
02:31:40,133 --> 02:31:43,595
One count engaging in conspiracy
to commit money laundering.

3325
02:31:43,679 --> 02:31:45,931
Twenty-one counts money laundering.

3326
02:31:46,014 --> 02:31:48,392
One count obstruction of justice.

3327
02:31:49,434 --> 02:31:51,645
Bail is set at $10 million.

3328
02:32:06,868 --> 02:32:08,453
<i>Uncle Donnie's here!</i>

3329
02:32:09,246 --> 02:32:11,498
Rocky. How you doing?

3330
02:32:12,791 --> 02:32:14,459
I hate that fucking dog.

3331
02:32:14,543 --> 02:32:16,878
Yeah, he's getting old and decrepit.

3332
02:32:16,962 --> 02:32:18,463
Starting to shit in the house again.

3333
02:32:18,547 --> 02:32:20,257
- Me, too.
- Come here, buddy.

3334
02:32:20,340 --> 02:32:21,633
Ah, fuck.

3335
02:32:21,717 --> 02:32:23,343
- It's good to see you, pal.
- Yeah, you, too.

3336
02:32:23,427 --> 02:32:24,636
Good to see you.

3337
02:32:24,720 --> 02:32:27,222
Sit down. Oh, man.

3338
02:32:29,099 --> 02:32:30,392
How you doing, brother?

3339
02:32:31,226 --> 02:32:32,728
You know.

3340
02:32:32,811 --> 02:32:34,479
Shitty, pal.

3341
02:32:34,563 --> 02:32:36,690
But I'm hanging in there.

3342
02:32:38,025 --> 02:32:40,527
My new piece of jewelry. Check that out.

3343
02:32:40,610 --> 02:32:42,988
Can't leave the house, you know?

3344
02:32:43,071 --> 02:32:45,657
Starting to get cabin fever already.

3345
02:32:46,241 --> 02:32:47,784
Fucking Rugrat.

3346
02:32:48,368 --> 02:32:49,661
That wig-wearing faggot.

3347
02:32:49,745 --> 02:32:51,872
I can't believe that fucking guy.
I wanna kill him.

3348
02:32:51,955 --> 02:32:54,541
Swear to God,
I want to choke him to death.

3349
02:32:54,624 --> 02:32:56,918
Irresponsible little prick.

3350
02:32:57,044 --> 02:32:58,086
I'll tell you one thing.

3351
02:33:00,464 --> 02:33:02,966
I'm never eating at Benihana again.

3352
02:33:03,842 --> 02:33:06,011
I don't care whose birthday it is.

3353
02:33:07,429 --> 02:33:08,972
Where's Naomi? How's she doing?

3354
02:33:09,765 --> 02:33:11,058
That's her in the house there.

3355
02:33:11,141 --> 02:33:13,101
You could say hi,
but she probably won't wave back.

3356
02:33:13,352 --> 02:33:14,978
Naomi, sweetheart!

3357
02:33:18,440 --> 02:33:19,691
What's up her ass?

3358
02:33:19,775 --> 02:33:21,318
- Is she mad at me?
- No, you know...

3359
02:33:21,401 --> 02:33:22,861
We probably have
to mortgage the house

3360
02:33:22,944 --> 02:33:24,738
in order to make bail.

3361
02:33:24,821 --> 02:33:28,533
Probably end up selling the thing
in order to pay for all the lawyers.

3362
02:33:28,617 --> 02:33:31,078
It's been a nightmare, buddy,
to tell you the truth.

3363
02:33:31,328 --> 02:33:33,038
What are you gonna do, right?

3364
02:33:33,830 --> 02:33:36,666
Anyway, how's Stratton?
That's more important.

3365
02:33:36,750 --> 02:33:37,834
How's morale?

3366
02:33:37,918 --> 02:33:40,545
They all pissed off 'cause they have
to make money legally now?

3367
02:33:40,629 --> 02:33:42,089
Jordan.

3368
02:33:42,464 --> 02:33:44,883
I got the founding partners together.

3369
02:33:44,966 --> 02:33:47,386
I talked to them about everything.

3370
02:33:48,136 --> 02:33:49,137
And I got you.

3371
02:33:49,971 --> 02:33:51,556
What do you mean, you got me?

3372
02:33:52,724 --> 02:33:55,477
The house, money,
don't worry about it. I got you.

3373
02:34:01,483 --> 02:34:02,567
All right.

3374
02:34:02,651 --> 02:34:03,610
I love you, buddy.

3375
02:34:03,693 --> 02:34:05,612
- You know I'd do it for you, right?
- I know.

3376
02:34:05,695 --> 02:34:07,656
- You know that, right?
- I know.

3377
02:34:08,657 --> 02:34:09,783
I could fucking kiss you all over.

3378
02:34:09,866 --> 02:34:11,034
All right, enough, enough.

3379
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:14,246
You want a beer, pal?

3380
02:34:14,329 --> 02:34:15,580
What are you drinking?

3381
02:34:15,664 --> 02:34:17,749
I got this non-alcoholic shit.

3382
02:34:17,833 --> 02:34:19,042
What's that?

3383
02:34:19,126 --> 02:34:22,129
A non-alcoholic beer. It's got no alcohol.

3384
02:34:22,212 --> 02:34:24,506
- It's a beer?
- Yeah, with no alcohol.

3385
02:34:25,048 --> 02:34:26,299
But if you drink enough,

3386
02:34:26,383 --> 02:34:28,301
if you drink a lot,
they get you fucked up?

3387
02:34:28,385 --> 02:34:30,470
No, there's no alcohol.
That's the fucking point.

3388
02:34:30,554 --> 02:34:31,596
I'm not a scientist.

3389
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:32,848
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

3390
02:34:32,931 --> 02:34:34,516
I can get you a beer
if you want a fucking beer.

3391
02:34:34,641 --> 02:34:36,768
I know, but I don't drink. You remember?

3392
02:34:36,852 --> 02:34:38,061
I don't drink anymore.

3393
02:34:38,145 --> 02:34:40,605
Oh, you wanna go inside
and blow some lines of baking powder?

3394
02:34:40,689 --> 02:34:41,857
Or baking soda...

3395
02:34:42,649 --> 02:34:44,943
Can't imagine ever not enjoying
getting fucked up.

3396
02:34:45,026 --> 02:34:46,445
- Yeah.
- I love it.

3397
02:34:46,528 --> 02:34:48,071
How's being sober?

3398
02:34:48,155 --> 02:34:49,990
- Fucking sucks.
- Boring, right?

3399
02:34:50,073 --> 02:34:52,492
So boring. I wanna kill myself.

3400
02:34:53,034 --> 02:34:55,579
There's a term,
and we don't like to use it

3401
02:34:55,662 --> 02:34:57,122
unless circumstances dictate,

3402
02:34:57,205 --> 02:34:59,166
and I think they do dictate in this case,

3403
02:34:59,249 --> 02:35:00,667
and the term is "Grenada."

3404
02:35:00,750 --> 02:35:02,294
Have you ever heard of Grenada?

3405
02:35:02,377 --> 02:35:03,420
No. No, I haven't.

3406
02:35:03,545 --> 02:35:07,048
Grenada's very interesting because
it is a small island nation

3407
02:35:07,132 --> 02:35:10,677
that was invaded by
the United States of America in 1983.

3408
02:35:10,760 --> 02:35:12,846
It's about 90,000 people.

3409
02:35:12,929 --> 02:35:15,182
And essentially, it means

3410
02:35:15,932 --> 02:35:17,934
this case is unloseable.

3411
02:35:18,018 --> 02:35:19,102
Okay?

3412
02:35:19,186 --> 02:35:20,770
So, you know, we can come in,

3413
02:35:20,854 --> 02:35:22,689
we can have our dick
hanging out of our pants.

3414
02:35:22,772 --> 02:35:23,940
Nobody gives a fuck.

3415
02:35:24,024 --> 02:35:25,567
I'm gonna win.

3416
02:35:25,734 --> 02:35:27,110
You, sir,

3417
02:35:28,653 --> 02:35:30,405
are what's known

3418
02:35:31,406 --> 02:35:32,616
as a Grenada.

3419
02:35:35,744 --> 02:35:38,079
You're looking at real prison time.

3420
02:35:39,247 --> 02:35:41,583
Money laundering
can get you as much as 20 years.

3421
02:35:42,584 --> 02:35:45,253
And our case couldn't be stronger
if we caught you

3422
02:35:45,337 --> 02:35:47,005
shoving cash in your mattress.

3423
02:35:47,088 --> 02:35:48,131
Is that right?

3424
02:35:49,007 --> 02:35:51,426
Hey, Jordan. Jordan.

3425
02:35:52,135 --> 02:35:55,972
Your rotting away in jail
till your kids get out of college,

3426
02:35:56,056 --> 02:35:57,682
that's not our ambition here.

3427
02:35:59,100 --> 02:36:01,645
There's other people
involved in this, too.

3428
02:36:01,728 --> 02:36:04,856
We think they need
to see their day in court as well.

3429
02:36:07,442 --> 02:36:09,486
Why do I sense
there's an offer in the air?

3430
02:36:09,569 --> 02:36:12,239
Look at him. He's got a sense.
What are you, Kreskin?

3431
02:36:13,448 --> 02:36:16,201
Full cooperation. He provides us
with a comprehensive list

3432
02:36:16,284 --> 02:36:18,662
of all the co-conspirators
spanning the last seven years,

3433
02:36:18,745 --> 02:36:20,705
and he also agrees to wear a wire.

3434
02:36:20,789 --> 02:36:22,040
Wait...

3435
02:36:22,123 --> 02:36:23,875
Did you just say "wear a wire"?

3436
02:36:23,959 --> 02:36:25,210
A wire.

3437
02:36:25,293 --> 02:36:26,670
What does that mean?

3438
02:36:26,753 --> 02:36:28,588
You want me to rat? Is that it?

3439
02:36:28,672 --> 02:36:29,965
No, I want you to cooperate.

3440
02:36:30,048 --> 02:36:31,967
- No. You want me to rat, right?
- Yes. We want you to rat.

3441
02:36:32,050 --> 02:36:35,887
That's fucking exactly
what we want you to do. To rat.

3442
02:36:39,975 --> 02:36:41,810
How was Cristy's party?

3443
02:36:41,893 --> 02:36:42,978
Fine.

3444
02:36:43,061 --> 02:36:44,437
Good.

3445
02:36:45,605 --> 02:36:48,066
Babe, I spoke
to the lawyers again today.

3446
02:36:48,149 --> 02:36:50,819
I have some really, really great news.

3447
02:36:52,654 --> 02:36:55,198
Turns out you're completely
off the hook, honey.

3448
02:36:56,157 --> 02:36:57,826
I know that already.

3449
02:36:57,909 --> 02:36:59,411
Right. Exactly.

3450
02:36:59,494 --> 02:37:02,706
You never did anything wrong
in the first place, right?

3451
02:37:03,665 --> 02:37:05,875
It turns out, all the FBI really

3452
02:37:06,543 --> 02:37:10,213
wants from me is to cooperate.

3453
02:37:10,463 --> 02:37:11,673
You know?

3454
02:37:11,756 --> 02:37:14,759
Turns out I have so much information
about the stock market and Wall Street,

3455
02:37:14,843 --> 02:37:16,636
I could save the government
years of heartache,

3456
02:37:16,720 --> 02:37:19,347
not to mention countless dollars.

3457
02:37:20,849 --> 02:37:23,184
But it gets even better, babe.

3458
02:37:23,643 --> 02:37:26,187
Because if I do decide to cooperate,

3459
02:37:26,563 --> 02:37:29,399
I might only be looking
at four short years,

3460
02:37:29,482 --> 02:37:30,942
in which case, you know,

3461
02:37:31,026 --> 02:37:34,070
we could start fresh,
maybe sell the house.

3462
02:37:34,154 --> 02:37:35,780
And any fines that I'd have to pay

3463
02:37:35,864 --> 02:37:37,657
wouldn't be due
till after I serve my term,

3464
02:37:37,741 --> 02:37:40,035
so we'd still have plenty
of money left over, you know?

3465
02:37:42,704 --> 02:37:45,123
The only thing that
of course bummed me out a little bit

3466
02:37:45,206 --> 02:37:50,253
is this whole idea of having to
give information about my friends.

3467
02:37:50,337 --> 02:37:53,548
Like you said, "There's no friends
on Wall Street." Right?

3468
02:37:53,632 --> 02:37:55,592
Right. Right. Exactly.

3469
02:37:55,675 --> 02:37:57,260
There's a silver lining
to that, too, honey.

3470
02:37:57,344 --> 02:37:59,012
Because they said eventually...

3471
02:37:59,095 --> 02:38:01,973
Eventually everyone's gonna have
to give information on this case.

3472
02:38:02,057 --> 02:38:04,851
So, at the end of the day, it might
not even be a factor. You know?

3473
02:38:04,934 --> 02:38:07,062
Well, that's good news. Right?

3474
02:38:07,187 --> 02:38:08,897
Yeah, yeah.

3475
02:38:08,980 --> 02:38:10,690
I'm really happy for you.

3476
02:38:12,067 --> 02:38:15,320
What do you mean,
happy for me, sweetheart?

3477
02:38:16,237 --> 02:38:18,823
You should be happy for
the both of us. Right?

3478
02:38:18,907 --> 02:38:20,867
- Yeah, right.
- All right.

3479
02:38:22,952 --> 02:38:24,579
Come here, baby.

3480
02:38:25,080 --> 02:38:26,623
Give me a kiss, sweetheart.

3481
02:38:26,706 --> 02:38:27,707
Jordan...

3482
02:38:27,791 --> 02:38:29,000
Oh, come on, baby.

3483
02:38:29,084 --> 02:38:31,294
I haven't made love to you
in so long. Please.

3484
02:38:31,378 --> 02:38:33,797
- No. Jordan, stop it.
- Come on, honey, please.

3485
02:38:33,880 --> 02:38:35,298
No! Jordan, stop it!

3486
02:38:37,050 --> 02:38:39,260
I've loved you
since the moment I saw you.

3487
02:38:43,139 --> 02:38:45,016
I fucking hate you, Jordan.

3488
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:48,144
- Get off me!
- Baby... Don't do that.

3489
02:38:49,020 --> 02:38:50,939
You know how much I love you, right?

3490
02:38:51,439 --> 02:38:53,608
Stop that, sweetie. Please.

3491
02:38:58,863 --> 02:39:00,907
You wanna fuck me, Jordan?

3492
02:39:02,659 --> 02:39:04,369
You wanna fuck me?

3493
02:39:05,370 --> 02:39:06,496
Good.

3494
02:39:06,579 --> 02:39:07,914
Go ahead.

3495
02:39:08,415 --> 02:39:10,333
Go ahead and fuck me.

3496
02:39:11,418 --> 02:39:13,837
I want you to fuck me real hard.

3497
02:39:13,962 --> 02:39:16,631
I want you to fuck me like
it's the last fucking time.

3498
02:39:16,715 --> 02:39:18,049
- Why are you moving like that?
- Come on.

3499
02:39:18,133 --> 02:39:19,092
Please hold still.

3500
02:39:19,175 --> 02:39:20,719
'Cause I want you to come for me, baby.

3501
02:39:20,802 --> 02:39:22,137
Come on, babe.

3502
02:39:22,220 --> 02:39:23,722
Come for me, baby.

3503
02:39:23,805 --> 02:39:25,014
I want you to come for me

3504
02:39:25,098 --> 02:39:26,558
like it's the last fucking time.

3505
02:39:26,641 --> 02:39:28,101
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

3506
02:39:28,184 --> 02:39:30,770
Come on, baby. Come for me.
Come for me, baby.

3507
02:39:30,854 --> 02:39:31,980
Come on, baby.

3508
02:39:32,063 --> 02:39:33,398
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

3509
02:39:33,481 --> 02:39:35,400
- Yeah, baby, come.
- You want me to come for you?

3510
02:39:35,483 --> 02:39:36,651
Yeah.

3511
02:39:37,485 --> 02:39:39,446
- You want me to come for you?
- Yeah!

3512
02:39:39,529 --> 02:39:41,865
Huh? You want me to come for you?

3513
02:39:43,700 --> 02:39:45,410
Oh, God, baby. Yeah!

3514
02:39:45,493 --> 02:39:47,996
Oh, God. Oh, God.

3515
02:39:49,330 --> 02:39:51,666
Oh, God.

3516
02:39:52,333 --> 02:39:53,752
Oh, God.

3517
02:39:53,835 --> 02:39:55,086
Jesus.

3518
02:39:58,715 --> 02:40:00,049
Oh, baby.

3519
02:40:00,133 --> 02:40:02,635
That was so fucking great!

3520
02:40:02,719 --> 02:40:04,012
Oh, God!

3521
02:40:06,347 --> 02:40:08,308
That was the last time.

3522
02:40:08,808 --> 02:40:10,769
What do you mean, baby?

3523
02:40:10,852 --> 02:40:13,813
I mean that was the last time
we ever have sex.

3524
02:40:14,814 --> 02:40:16,858
What are you talking about?

3525
02:40:18,860 --> 02:40:20,528
I want a divorce.

3526
02:40:22,113 --> 02:40:24,115
What do you mean, you want a divorce?

3527
02:40:24,199 --> 02:40:26,242
What's that supposed to mean,
you want a divorce?

3528
02:40:26,326 --> 02:40:28,203
Get off me! I want a divorce.

3529
02:40:28,536 --> 02:40:29,788
You just made love to me.

3530
02:40:29,871 --> 02:40:30,955
What the fuck is wrong with you?

3531
02:40:31,039 --> 02:40:33,374
I don't love you anymore, Jordan!

3532
02:40:34,667 --> 02:40:36,628
Oh, you don't love me?

3533
02:40:37,045 --> 02:40:38,630
You don't love me anymore, huh?

3534
02:40:38,713 --> 02:40:40,965
Well, isn't that just fucking
convenient for you!

3535
02:40:41,049 --> 02:40:42,884
Now that I'm under federal indictment,

3536
02:40:42,967 --> 02:40:44,928
with an electronic bracelet
around my ankle,

3537
02:40:45,011 --> 02:40:46,721
now you decide you don't
fucking love me anymore.

3538
02:40:46,805 --> 02:40:48,556
- Is that right?
- No, no.

3539
02:40:48,890 --> 02:40:51,142
What kind of person are you? Tell me.

3540
02:40:51,226 --> 02:40:52,477
You married me!

3541
02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:54,062
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

3542
02:40:54,145 --> 02:40:55,814
Jordan, this is how it's gonna go.

3543
02:40:55,897 --> 02:40:58,066
I'm gonna take custody of the kids.

3544
02:40:58,149 --> 02:41:01,694
If you agree to the divorce right now,
I will allow visitation.

3545
02:41:01,820 --> 02:41:03,655
- Okay? Don't try to fight it.
- Oh, my God.

3546
02:41:03,738 --> 02:41:07,909
It'll save us both a lot of money
and I got a feeling you're gonna need it.

3547
02:41:09,452 --> 02:41:12,664
You're not taking my kids, sweetheart.
You hear me?

3548
02:41:12,747 --> 02:41:14,165
I've already talked to the lawyer.

3549
02:41:14,249 --> 02:41:15,500
He said even if you don't get convicted,

3550
02:41:15,583 --> 02:41:16,668
I've got a good chance of getting them.

3551
02:41:16,751 --> 02:41:17,836
I got news for you.

3552
02:41:17,919 --> 02:41:21,339
You're not fucking taking my children,
you vicious fucking cunt, you!

3553
02:41:21,881 --> 02:41:23,842
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!

3554
02:41:23,925 --> 02:41:26,094
You're not fucking taking
my goddamn fucking kids!

3555
02:41:26,177 --> 02:41:27,554
You hear me? Fuck you!

3556
02:41:27,762 --> 02:41:30,515
You're not fucking
taking my fucking kids!

3557
02:41:39,107 --> 02:41:40,900
Fucking bitch!

3558
02:41:43,361 --> 02:41:44,737
Fucking whore!

3559
02:41:49,117 --> 02:41:51,786
Fucking bitch!
Piece of shit fucking whore!

3560
02:42:00,962 --> 02:42:03,715
Look at yourself, Jordan.

3561
02:42:03,798 --> 02:42:04,966
You're sick!

3562
02:42:05,049 --> 02:42:06,217
You're a sick man!

3563
02:42:06,301 --> 02:42:08,344
Fuck you! I told you,
you're not taking my fucking kids!

3564
02:42:08,428 --> 02:42:10,889
You think I would let my kids near you?

3565
02:42:10,972 --> 02:42:12,140
Look at yourself!

3566
02:42:12,223 --> 02:42:13,725
You know what my lawyer said?

3567
02:42:13,808 --> 02:42:17,270
My lawyer said that you're going
to prison for 20 years, Jordan.

3568
02:42:17,353 --> 02:42:20,607
Twenty fucking years!
You're never gonna see the kids again!

3569
02:42:20,690 --> 02:42:21,900
You don't think I'm not gonna see my...

3570
02:42:21,983 --> 02:42:23,735
No, I'm not fucking
letting you near my kids!

3571
02:42:23,818 --> 02:42:25,987
You don't think I'm gonna see
my fucking kids again, huh?

3572
02:42:26,070 --> 02:42:27,614
Don't you fucking touch them!

3573
02:42:28,948 --> 02:42:30,742
Don't you fucking touch me!

3574
02:42:32,452 --> 02:42:35,705
Sweetheart? You're coming
on a trip with Daddy, all right?

3575
02:42:35,788 --> 02:42:37,749
You're coming on a trip with Daddy.

3576
02:42:40,501 --> 02:42:42,754
Don't you fucking touch her, Jordan.

3577
02:42:42,837 --> 02:42:45,590
I swear to God, I will fucking kill you!

3578
02:42:48,259 --> 02:42:49,510
It's all right, baby.

3579
02:42:49,594 --> 02:42:52,305
You and Daddy are gonna go
on a little trip together, okay?

3580
02:42:52,388 --> 02:42:53,932
- A little trip together.
- Violet!

3581
02:42:54,015 --> 02:42:55,099
Violet!

3582
02:42:55,183 --> 02:42:57,393
- Get the key! Get the key!
- I got it!

3583
02:42:57,477 --> 02:42:59,103
Jordan, you open this fucking door

3584
02:42:59,187 --> 02:43:01,981
- right now! Open the door!
- Put your seat belt on.

3585
02:43:02,065 --> 02:43:03,399
There you go. Get your legs in.

3586
02:43:03,483 --> 02:43:05,109
I'm taking her with me!

3587
02:43:05,193 --> 02:43:07,820
I told you I'm taking her with me,
you fucking bitch!

3588
02:43:07,904 --> 02:43:10,615
You're not gonna stop me!
You're not gonna stop me!

3589
02:43:11,407 --> 02:43:13,493
We're going on a little trip, honey.

3590
02:43:13,910 --> 02:43:15,411
No! No!

3591
02:43:16,037 --> 02:43:17,413
Get the hell out of here!

3592
02:43:17,497 --> 02:43:19,624
Leave that baby alone!

3593
02:43:19,707 --> 02:43:21,876
Violet! Garage door! Close it!

3594
02:43:21,960 --> 02:43:23,086
Mommy!

3595
02:43:23,211 --> 02:43:25,380
- Get out of here!
- Open the fucking door!

3596
02:43:26,297 --> 02:43:27,423
Mommy!

3597
02:43:30,468 --> 02:43:32,095
No!

3598
02:43:39,394 --> 02:43:42,146
Oh, Lord! Oh, my heavens...

3599
02:43:42,230 --> 02:43:43,523
Get the baby!

3600
02:43:43,606 --> 02:43:45,733
Naomi, get the baby!

3601
02:43:46,484 --> 02:43:48,152
- Mommy.
- Honey, it's okay.

3602
02:43:48,236 --> 02:43:49,487
It's gonna be okay.

3603
02:43:49,570 --> 02:43:51,572
Oh, Mr. Jordan has lost his mind.

3604
02:43:52,573 --> 02:43:54,367
- Baby...
- It's all right, honey.

3605
02:43:54,450 --> 02:43:56,035
She all right?

3606
02:43:56,119 --> 02:43:57,412
Is she all right?

3607
02:43:58,162 --> 02:43:59,747
What's the matter with you?

3608
02:43:59,998 --> 02:44:01,332
Is she all right?

3609
02:44:08,715 --> 02:44:10,091
<i>Paragraph one.</i>

3610
02:44:10,174 --> 02:44:11,676
<i>The defendant shall plead guilty</i>

3611
02:44:11,759 --> 02:44:15,179
<i>to all counts of the indictment
currently pending against him</i>

3612
02:44:15,263 --> 02:44:19,100
<i>in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of New York.</i>

3613
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:20,685
<i>Paragraph two.</i>

3614
02:44:20,768 --> 02:44:21,894
Talk normally.

3615
02:44:21,978 --> 02:44:25,189
<i>The defendant shall participate
in undercover activities...</i>

3616
02:44:25,273 --> 02:44:26,399
Breathe normally.

3617
02:44:26,482 --> 02:44:30,028
<i>...including wearing a recording device,
also known as a wire...</i>

3618
02:44:30,111 --> 02:44:32,280
After five minutes,
you'll forget you even have it on.

3619
02:44:32,363 --> 02:44:33,489
<i>...in conjunction with the investigation...</i>

3620
02:44:33,573 --> 02:44:35,116
Fucking brutal.

3621
02:44:35,241 --> 02:44:36,492
Quit your bitching.

3622
02:44:36,576 --> 02:44:38,411
Paragraph four.
The defendant must not commit,

3623
02:44:38,494 --> 02:44:40,663
or attempt to commit,
any further crimes.

3624
02:44:40,747 --> 02:44:44,208
Please. Let me just sign
the fucking thing already.

3625
02:44:44,292 --> 02:44:45,668
Thank you.

3626
02:44:48,629 --> 02:44:49,797
Just here?

3627
02:44:49,881 --> 02:44:51,424
That'd be good.

3628
02:44:53,134 --> 02:44:54,260
Thank you.

3629
02:44:54,343 --> 02:44:55,970
<i>It wasn't even a choice.</i>

3630
02:44:57,013 --> 02:45:00,016
<i>For the next six hours,
I came up with a list.</i>

3631
02:45:00,308 --> 02:45:03,227
<i>Friends, enemies, business associates.</i>

3632
02:45:03,311 --> 02:45:07,398
<i>Anybody who'd ever known me
or taken so much as a stock tip.</i>

3633
02:45:12,945 --> 02:45:15,239
Wolfie! Wolfie! Wolfie!

3634
02:45:17,033 --> 02:45:19,827
<i>The first name on the list was Donnie.</i>

3635
02:45:22,205 --> 02:45:25,333
Jordan, do you know how good it is
to have you back in this office?

3636
02:45:25,708 --> 02:45:27,752
It's not the same when you're gone.

3637
02:45:27,835 --> 02:45:29,587
It's sad, you understand? It's like...

3638
02:45:29,670 --> 02:45:31,089
That fucking Steve Madden, huh?

3639
02:45:31,172 --> 02:45:32,340
I can't...

3640
02:45:32,423 --> 02:45:34,258
Swear to God, I can't even think about it.

3641
02:45:34,342 --> 02:45:36,219
Every time I think about him,
my blood boils.

3642
02:45:36,302 --> 02:45:37,970
I can't even say his name.

3643
02:45:38,054 --> 02:45:39,597
- I know.
- It's, like, disgusting.

3644
02:45:39,680 --> 02:45:42,058
I grew up with this guy
and he betrays me like that.

3645
02:45:43,351 --> 02:45:46,270
He ever get back to you about that...

3646
02:45:47,021 --> 02:45:48,773
About that account?

3647
02:45:54,612 --> 02:45:55,655
You remember.

3648
02:45:55,738 --> 02:45:57,740
It was like four or five mil,
something like that, right?

3649
02:45:57,824 --> 02:46:00,952
He was supposed
to kick back four or five mil, was it?

3650
02:46:05,373 --> 02:46:06,833
Actually, I was...

3651
02:46:06,916 --> 02:46:08,292
I was fucked up, Jordan,

3652
02:46:08,376 --> 02:46:09,877
- so I don't really remember.
- Yeah.

3653
02:46:09,961 --> 02:46:11,963
Yeah, right. Stupid.

3654
02:46:12,630 --> 02:46:16,634
Well, if he calls you,
you make sure and contact me, okay?

3655
02:46:18,469 --> 02:46:20,138
- Yeah. Of course.
- Yeah.

3656
02:46:20,221 --> 02:46:22,306
Of course, yeah. No, of course.

3657
02:46:25,726 --> 02:46:28,229
You gonna eat
that last piece of yellow tail, bud?

3658
02:46:29,272 --> 02:46:31,023
No, it's all yours.

3659
02:46:31,858 --> 02:46:33,192
Can I get this?

3660
02:46:35,695 --> 02:46:37,405
So, what else is...

3661
02:46:40,158 --> 02:46:42,160
Well, how's Naomi and everything?

3662
02:46:42,243 --> 02:46:43,661
You know how it is.

3663
02:46:43,744 --> 02:46:45,830
She hates my fucking guts.

3664
02:46:47,582 --> 02:46:49,250
How's Hildy? Good?

3665
02:46:50,084 --> 02:46:53,671
She's still alive,
so my life is fucked, you know?

3666
02:46:53,754 --> 02:46:54,922
Yeah.

3667
02:47:01,762 --> 02:47:03,264
Mr. Jordan.

3668
02:47:04,932 --> 02:47:07,101
Mr. Jordan, you got a visitor.

3669
02:47:07,476 --> 02:47:08,519
What?

3670
02:47:08,978 --> 02:47:10,771
You've got a visitor.

3671
02:47:26,287 --> 02:47:28,289
I need you to get dressed.

3672
02:47:28,372 --> 02:47:30,583
Why? What the fuck's going on?

3673
02:47:35,630 --> 02:47:37,423
You're going to jail.

3674
02:47:49,352 --> 02:47:50,561
All right.

3675
02:47:50,645 --> 02:47:52,230
I'll get some clothes on.

3676
02:47:52,313 --> 02:47:54,649
We'll give you a hand with that.

3677
02:48:03,241 --> 02:48:04,325
Okay.

3678
02:48:16,545 --> 02:48:17,797
FBI!

3679
02:48:18,214 --> 02:48:21,801
Everybody sit down. Put your hands
where they can be seen, and shut up!

3680
02:48:21,884 --> 02:48:23,594
Don't you fucking touch me.

3681
02:48:23,678 --> 02:48:25,805
Get your fucking hands off me!

3682
02:48:25,888 --> 02:48:27,640
Don't get out of your seats!

3683
02:48:40,861 --> 02:48:42,488
It's fucking Chanel!

3684
02:48:55,126 --> 02:48:57,211
<i>I gave up everyone.</i>

3685
02:48:57,378 --> 02:48:58,879
<i>And in return,</i>

3686
02:48:58,963 --> 02:49:03,342
<i>I got three years in some hellhole
in Nevada I'd never even heard of</i>

3687
02:49:05,219 --> 02:49:07,596
<i>Like my pops, Mad Max, had said,</i>

3688
02:49:08,389 --> 02:49:10,975
<i>"The chickens had come home to roost."</i>

3689
02:49:12,393 --> 02:49:14,603
<i>Whatever the fuck that means.</i>

3690
02:49:18,190 --> 02:49:19,483
<i>I hope Your Honor would agree</i>

3691
02:49:19,567 --> 02:49:21,569
that Mr. Belfort
has distinguished himself

3692
02:49:21,652 --> 02:49:23,738
in terms of his cooperation.

3693
02:49:23,821 --> 02:49:25,865
Mr. Belfort has helped
the government win convictions

3694
02:49:25,948 --> 02:49:28,492
of over two dozen serious offenders

3695
02:49:29,744 --> 02:49:31,662
and helped them
recover millions of dollars

3696
02:49:31,746 --> 02:49:35,166
to be made available
for restitution to their victims.

3697
02:49:37,418 --> 02:49:41,088
The sentence of the court shall be
36 months in federal prison.

3698
02:49:42,923 --> 02:49:45,051
Please remand the defendant.

3699
02:49:47,261 --> 02:49:48,971
I'm sorry.

3700
02:49:51,891 --> 02:49:52,933
That's okay.

3701
02:50:41,315 --> 02:50:43,734
<i>I'm not ashamed to admit it.</i>

3702
02:50:43,818 --> 02:50:45,653
<i>When we arrived at the prison,</i>

3703
02:50:45,736 --> 02:50:47,905
<i>I was absolutely terrified.</i>

3704
02:50:48,697 --> 02:50:50,074
Belfort, on your feet.

3705
02:50:50,157 --> 02:50:52,451
<i>But I needn't have been.</i>

3706
02:50:52,660 --> 02:50:55,287
<i>You see, for a brief fleeting moment,</i>

3707
02:50:55,996 --> 02:50:58,040
<i>I'd forgotten I was rich.</i>

3708
02:50:59,041 --> 02:51:02,503
<i>And I lived in a place
where everything was for sale.</i>

3709
02:51:05,005 --> 02:51:07,716
<i>Wouldn't you like to learn how to sell it?</i>

3710
02:51:07,800 --> 02:51:10,678
<i>So listen. I've met some
bad motherfuckers in my life.</i>

3711
02:51:10,761 --> 02:51:14,223
<i>I'm talking about rock stars,
professional athletes, gangsters.</i>

3712
02:51:14,306 --> 02:51:16,100
<i>I'm telling you,
some real bad motherfuckers.</i>

3713
02:51:16,183 --> 02:51:18,477
<i>But this guy, my good friend,</i>

3714
02:51:18,561 --> 02:51:21,313
<i>Mr. Jordan Belfort, is the single</i>

3715
02:51:21,397 --> 02:51:24,191
baddest motherfucker I have ever met.

3716
02:51:24,733 --> 02:51:26,444
So I want you right now

3717
02:51:26,527 --> 02:51:29,655
to give a warm Auckland,
New Zealand welcome

3718
02:51:29,738 --> 02:51:34,118
for my good friend
and the world's greatest sales trainer,

3719
02:51:34,201 --> 02:51:36,454
Mr. Jordan Belfort!

3720
02:51:47,423 --> 02:51:48,716
Thank you.

3721
02:52:11,697 --> 02:52:13,407
Sell me this pen.

3722
02:52:17,995 --> 02:52:20,039
It's...

3723
02:52:20,331 --> 02:52:22,082
It's an amazing pen.

3724
02:52:22,416 --> 02:52:24,585
For professionals, it's a...

3725
02:52:27,713 --> 02:52:29,423
Sell me this pen.

3726
02:52:30,424 --> 02:52:31,634
Well, it's a nice pen.

3727
02:52:31,717 --> 02:52:33,010
You can use the pen

3728
02:52:33,093 --> 02:52:36,305
to write down thoughts
from your life so you can...

3729
02:52:38,098 --> 02:52:41,435
Sell me this pen.

3730
02:52:43,437 --> 02:52:44,647
Well...

3731
02:52:45,022 --> 02:52:48,609
This pen works
and I personally love this pen...
