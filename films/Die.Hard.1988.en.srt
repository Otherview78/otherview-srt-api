1
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,225
You don't like flying, do you?

2
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:01,353
What gives you that idea?

3
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:08,151
You wanna know the secret
to surviving air travel?

4
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,238
After you get where you're going,
take off your shoes and socks.

5
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:16,743
Then you walk around on the rug barefoot
and make fists with your toes.

6
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,037
Fists with your toes?

7
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,959
I know. It sounds crazy. Trust me.
I've been doing it for nine years.

8
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:28,213
Yes, sir! Better than a shower
and a hot cup of coffee.

9
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,256
OK.

10
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,518
It's OK. I'm a cop.

11
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:47,274
Trust me. I've been doing this for 11 years.

12
00:01:47,566 --> 00:01:52,446
<i>The captain and the crew
would like to welcome you to Los Angeles.</i>

13
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,907
<i>Have a very merry Christmas.</i>

14
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:07,919
<i>Flight 247 to Tucson
now boarding at gate 14.</i>

15
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:14,468
<i>Flight 247 to Tucson
now boarding at gate 14.</i>

16
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,915
Ladies and gentlemen...

17
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,292
Ladies and gentlemen!

18
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:51,797
I want to congratulate all of you for
making this one of the greatest years

19
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,466
in the history of the Nakatomi Corporation.

20
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,181
On behalf of the Chief
Executive Officer, Mr Ozu,

21
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,433
and the Board of Directors,

22
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:07,729
we thank you one and all and wish you
a merry Christmas and a happy New Year!

23
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,982
Merry Christmas! Happy New Year!

24
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:15,487
Hey, Holly. What about dinner tonight?

25
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,198
Harry, it's Christmas Eve.

26
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,326
Families, stockings...

27
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,538
Chestnuts?

28
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,709
Rudolph and Frosty?
Any of these things ring a bell?

29
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:33,714
Actually, I was thinking more of
mulled wine, a nice aged Brie,

30
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:38,343
and a roaring fireplace.
You know what I'm saying?

31
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:43,598
Ginny, it's 5:40. Go join the party.
Have some champagne.

32
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,309
You're making me feel
like Ebenezer Scrooge.

33
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:50,105
Thanks. Do you think the baby
can handle a little sip?

34
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,275
That baby's ready to tend bar.

35
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:54,735
Last chance.

36
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,695
Bye.

37
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,662
McClane residence.
Lucy McClane speaking.

38
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:10,167
Hello, Lucy McClane.
This is your mother speaking.

39
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,211
<i>Mommy! When are you coming home?</i>

40
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:17,257
Pretty soon. You'll be in bed
when I get there, though.

41
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,843
Let me talk to Paulina, OK, hon?

42
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:24,264
And no snooping around the house
looking for presents.

43
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,850
Is Daddy coming home with you?

44
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:33,440
Well, we'll see what Santa
and Mommy can do, OK?

45
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,650
Put Paulina on. Bye, honey.

46
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,235
<i>Paulina!</i>

47
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,242
<i>Hola, Mrs Holly.</i>

48
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:47,204
Um, did Mr McClane call?

49
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,915
<i>No, Mrs Holly. No telefono.</i>

50
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,002
He probably didn't have time
before his flight.

51
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:58,048
It might be a good idea to make up
the spare bedroom, just in case.

52
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,134
Si, Mrs Holly. I do that already.

53
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,346
What would I do without you, Paulina?

54
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,914
California!

55
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,096
Hey, I'm John McClane.

56
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,765
Argyle. I'm your limo driver.

57
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,104
Nice bear.

58
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,695
OK... Argyle. What do we do now?

59
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:06,616
I was, uh, hoping you could tell me.
It's my first time driving a limo.

60
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,619
That's OK. It's my first time riding in one.

61
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,539
Relax. We got everything in this mug, man.

62
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,876
Look at this - CD, CB, TV,

63
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,461
telephone, full bar, VHS.

64
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:24,801
If your friend's hot to trot, I know
a few mama bears we can hook up with.

65
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,014
- Or is he married?
- He's married.

66
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,140
OK.

67
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,103
Oh, sorry about that. It's the girl's day off.

68
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,522
I didn't know you were gonna sit up front.

69
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,566
Your lady live out here?

70
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,068
About the past six months.

71
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,404
Meaning you still live in New York?

72
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:48,408
You always ask this many questions, Argyle?

73
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:53,079
Sorry. I used to drive a cab
and people would expect a little chitchat.

74
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,458
- So, you divorced?
- Just drive the car, man.

75
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,378
Hey, come on. You divorced?
You separated? She beat you up?!

76
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:07,427
She had a good job.
It turned into a great career.

77
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,432
- That meant she had to move here.
- You're very fast, Argyle.

78
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,185
So, why didn't you come?

79
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:21,316
Well? Why didn't you come with her?
What's up?

80
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,234
Because I'm a New York cop.

81
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:27,030
I got a backlog of scumbags
I'm still trying to put behind bars.

82
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,115
I can't just go that easy.

83
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,701
You thought she wasn't
gonna make it out here,

84
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:36,122
and she'd come crawling back to you
so why bother to pack, right?

85
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,292
Like I said, you're very fast, Argyle.

86
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,378
Mind if we hear some tunes?

87
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,758
Hey, that'll work.

88
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,720
No Christmas music?

89
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,598
This is Christmas music.

90
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,380
So your lady sees you,
you run into her arms,

91
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:29,134
the music comes up
and you live happily ever after, right?

92
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,012
I can live with that.

93
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,932
So, if it doesn't work out,
you got a place to stay?

94
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,685
I'll find a place.

95
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:44,190
I tell you what. I'll wait in the garage.
You score, give me a call on the car phone.

96
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:49,112
I'll take your bags to the desk.
You strike out, I'll get you a hotel.

97
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:53,742
- You're all right, Argyle.
- Remember that when you sign for the tip.

98
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,559
- Hi.
- Good evening.

99
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,603
I'm here to see Holly McClane.

100
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,855
Just type it in there.

101
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,154
Cute toy.

102
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:35,825
Yeah, if you have to take a leak,
it'll even help you find your zipper.

103
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,343
Christ!

104
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:00,517
- 30th floor?
- The party.

105
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,602
They're the only ones left.

106
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,439
Take the express elevator.
Get off where you hear the noise.

107
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,024
Thanks.

108
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,710
- Champagne, sir?
- Yeah, thanks.

109
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,038
Oh, I'm sorry.

110
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,124
Hey! Merry Christmas!

111
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,546
Jesus.

112
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,757
Fuckin' California!

113
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,967
I couldn't agree with you more.

114
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:00,261
Why don't I talk to him right now?

115
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,765
Hi. I'm looking for...

116
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,225
- Holly Gennero.
- Yeah.

117
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,268
Then you must be John McClane.

118
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,729
Joe Takagi. How was your ride in?

119
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,315
Nice. I have you to thank for that?

120
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,442
Seemed the least we could do.

121
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:18,404
- Quite a place you have here.
- It will be if we ever get it finished.

122
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,490
Still several floors under construction.

123
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:24,369
Holly went to fax some documents.
She should be back any minute.

124
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,664
In the meanwhile, her office is back here.

125
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:30,959
Ellis?

126
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,922
I was making a call.
This was the nearest phone.

127
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,591
I want you to meet John McClane,

128
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,718
Holly's husband.

129
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,679
Holly's policeman.

130
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,098
Ellis is in charge
of international development.

131
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,392
Heard a lot about you.

132
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,269
You missed some.

133
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,563
Can I get you anything?

134
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,692
Food? Cake?
Some watered-down champagne?

135
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,860
No, thank you. I'm fine.

136
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,531
You throw quite a party.

137
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,451
I didn't realise they celebrated
Christmas in Japan.

138
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:09,664
We're flexible. Pearl Harbor didn't work out,
so we got you with tape decks.

139
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:17,714
It's a double celebration. We closed
a big deal today, mainly due to Holly.

140
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,551
I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

141
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,056
John.

142
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:35,189
- Have you met everyone?
- We've been sticking him with spears!

143
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,859
Of course he has.

144
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,112
She was made for the business.
Tough as nails.

145
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,906
I was hoping you made that flight.

146
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,159
Show him the watch.

147
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,202
Later.

148
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:52,206
Show him. Are you embarrassed?
It's a token of appreciation

149
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,710
for all her hard work. It's a Rolex.

150
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,296
I'm sure I'll see it later.

151
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,382
Is there a place where I could wash up?

152
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,925
Sure.

153
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:22,862
You have to forgive Ellis.
He gets very depressed this time of year.

154
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,199
He thought he was
God's greatest gift, you know?

155
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,576
I know the type.

156
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,704
I think he's got his eye on you.

157
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:35,625
That's OK. I have my eye
on his private bathroom.

158
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,795
Where are you staying?
Things happened so fast

159
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,631
I didn't get a chance
to ask you on the phone.

160
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,217
Cappy Roberts retired out here.

161
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:49,555
- He said I could bunk with him.
- Cappy retired, huh? Where's he live?

162
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,850
- Romona.
- Ha! Pomona.

163
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,520
- Huh?
- Pomona.

164
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,480
- Pomona.
- Yeah.

165
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,733
You'll be in the car half the time.

166
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:05,738
Why don't we make it easy?
I have a spare bedroom.

167
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,449
It's not huge or anything, but...

168
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,994
the kids would love
to have you at the house.

169
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,124
They would, huh?

170
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,378
I would, too.

171
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,506
<i>Ooh!</i>

172
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,007
Sorry.

173
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,517
I missed you.

174
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,776
Didn't miss my name, though, huh?

175
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,071
Except maybe when you're signing cheques?

176
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:50,032
Since when did you start using Ms Gennero?

177
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:56,122
This is a Japanese company.
They figure a married woman's...

178
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,291
You are a married woman.

179
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:03,129
- This conversation again?
- We never finished this conversation.

180
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:08,468
- I had an opportunity. I had to take it.
- No matter what it did to our marriage.

181
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:12,680
- It changed your idea of our marriage.
- You have no clue what my idea...

182
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:16,350
I know exactly what your idea
of our marriage should be.

183
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,227
Ms Gennero, I...

184
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,647
Excuse me.

185
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,524
Hi.

186
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:29,530
Mr Takagi is looking for you.
He wants you to say something to the troops.

187
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,406
Thank you.

188
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,913
Speech time.

189
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,499
Be back in a few minutes.

190
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,345
That was great, John.

191
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,431
Good job. Very mature.

192
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:50,194
So Kareem rebounds. Feeds Worthy
on the break, over to AC, to Magic,

193
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,822
then back to Worthy.

194
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,740
Boom! Two points.

195
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:00,162
We're in.

196
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,896
<i>Links.</i> ..

197
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:34,942
<i>Re ch ts,</i>

198
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,819
<i>und wieder links.</i>

199
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,934
Son of a bitch.

200
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,315
Fists with your toes.

201
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,139
Yeah, Argyle?

202
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,724
<i>How's it going?</i>

203
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,059
OK. Where are you?

204
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,103
At the garage.
What's with you and your lady?

205
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,481
The vote's not in yet.

206
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:07,201
<i>- He, Bruder.
- Moment.</i>

207
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,744
<i>Nein! Nein! Nein!</i>

208
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,663
<i>Warte doch. Nicht!</i>

209
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,389
Argyle?

210
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,100
Mac, you there? Hello?

211
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,777
You know the number. Use it.

212
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,872
Stay calm. Everything's going to be fine.

213
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,832
Everything's going to be fine.

214
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,603
Shit!

215
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,066
Think.

216
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:46,026
Think.

217
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,170
Ladies and gentlemen.

218
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,589
Ladies and gentlemen.

219
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:19,226
Due to the Nakatomi Corporation's
legacy of greed around the globe,

220
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:24,523
they're about to be taught a lesson
in the real use of power.

221
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,817
You will be witnesses.

222
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,029
Now,

223
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,990
where is Mr Takagi?

224
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:39,038
Joseph Yashinobo Takagi,

225
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,499
born Kyoto, 1937.

226
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,835
<i>Don't move.</i>

227
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,630
Family emigrated to San Pedro,
California, 1939,

228
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,595
interned at Manzanar, 1942 to '43,

229
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,600
scholarship student,
University of California,

230
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:02,019
1955.

231
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:10,569
Law degree, Stanford, 1962.

232
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,947
MBA, Harvard, 1970.

233
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,826
President, Nakatomi Trading.

234
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,246
Vice Chairman, Nakatomi Investment Group...

235
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,414
Enough.

236
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,626
And father

237
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,252
<i>of five.</i>

238
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:30,297
I am Takagi.

239
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,508
How do you do?

240
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,802
It's a pleasure to meet you.

241
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,150
OK, 32... construction, 33... computers.

242
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,207
Nice suit.

243
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,502
John Phillips, London.

244
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,798
I have two myself.

245
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:16,927
Rumour has it Arafat buys his there.

246
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,684
- This way?
- On the left.

247
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:49,585
"And when Alexander saw
the breadth of his domain

248
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:53,547
he wept, for there were
no more worlds to conquer."

249
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,804
The benefits of a classical education.

250
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:05,058
Oh, that's beautiful.

251
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,438
I always enjoyed to make models
when I was a boy.

252
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:14,276
The exactness, the attention
to every conceivable detail.

253
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,695
It's beautiful.

254
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:21,241
Is this what this is all about?
Our project in Indonesia?

255
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:24,203
Contrary to what you people may think,

256
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:27,414
we're going to develop
that region, not exploit it.

257
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:32,127
I believe you. I read the article in Forbes.

258
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,256
Mr Takagi...

259
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:41,011
I could talk about industrialisation
and men's fashions all clay,

260
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,138
but I'm afraid work must intrude,

261
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:47,059
and my associate here
has some questions for you.

262
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,062
Sort of fill-in-the-blanks questions.

263
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,365
I don't have that code.

264
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,036
You broke in here to access our computer?

265
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,373
Any information you get,
when Tokyo wake up, they'll change it.

266
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,334
You won't be able to blackmail
our executives...

267
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,461
Sit... down!

268
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:28,892
Mr Takagi, I'm really not
interested in your computer.

269
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,774
But I need the code key

270
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:40,237
because I am interested in the $640 million

271
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,741
in negotiable bearer bonds
that you have locked in your vault

272
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:48,453
and the computer controls the vault.

273
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,999
You want money?

274
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:54,459
What kind of terrorists are you?

275
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,215
Who said we were terrorists?

276
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,529
The bonds represent, at most,

277
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:26,408
ten days' operating capital
for your parent organisation.

278
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,828
It's really no more
than a temporary inconvenience.

279
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:30,954
Now...

280
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,127
the code, please.

281
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,631
It's useless to you.
There are seven safeguards on our vault.

282
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:44,384
The code key's only one.
You won't get it open.

283
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:47,804
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.

284
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:51,850
- I told you.
- It's not over yet.

285
00:30:56,438 --> 00:31:00,108
It's a very nice suit, Mr Takagi.

286
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:04,029
It would be a shame to ruin it.

287
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,617
I'm going to count to three.

288
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,621
There will not be a four.

289
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,374
Give me the code.

290
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,626
One,

291
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,963
two,

292
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,051
- three.
- I don't know it.

293
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,012
Get on a jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman.

294
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,722
You'll have to kill me.

295
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:32,099
OK.

296
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,562
We do it the hard way.

297
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,648
Tony, dispose of that.

298
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:43,068
Karl, check on Heinrich's work
on the machine floor.

299
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,428
Nothing.

300
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,930
See to Heinrich.

301
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:14,933
Now...

302
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:18,437
you can break the code?

303
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,608
You didn't bring me along
for my charming personality.

304
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:32,701
Argyle, tell me you heard the shots.
You're calling the police now.

305
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:36,371
<i>Of course I'm still coming by later.

306
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,291
Sweetheart have I ever lied to you?

307
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,835
My boss thinks I'm on my way to Vegas.

308
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,672
Uli, get up on the pipes.

309
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,758
Marco, you go through here.

310
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,637
I'll throw you the cord.

311
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,810
Hans, we're on the roof.

312
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,532
Here.

313
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,287
Uli.

314
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,046
30 minutes to break the code,

315
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:31,468
two and a half hours
for the five mechanicals, at the minimum.

316
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,721
The seventh lock, however,
is out of my hands.

317
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,745
I'm sorry?

318
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:02,290
The seventh lock... the electromagnetic seal.

319
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,751
The circuits cannot be cut locally.

320
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:07,796
Trust me.

321
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:12,676
Why the fuck didn't you stop him, John?

322
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,596
Cos then you'd be dead, too, asshole.

323
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,682
Think, goddamn it! Think!

324
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,821
We've got a fire alarm.

325
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,115
Call 911.

326
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:39,202
Give them the guard's name
and cancel the alarm.

327
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:40,579
Then disable the sys...

328
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,918
Eddie, on what floor did the alarm go off?

329
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,797
Shall we go?

330
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,090
<i>Nein.</i>

331
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,477
Yes.

332
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:07,731
Hello, baby. Come to Papa. Come on.

333
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,733
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

334
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,111
Come on, baby.

335
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,321
Come on, baby.

336
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:18,992
Come on, baby. Come to Papa.
I'll kiss your fuckin' Dalmatian.

337
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,872
You stupid motherfuckers! No! No!

338
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,207
Turn the fuckin' truck around!

339
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,494
The fire has been called off, my friend.

340
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:09,501
No one is coming to help you.

341
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,716
You might as well come out
and join the others.

342
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:21,513
I promise I won't hurt you.

343
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:54,129
Drop it, dickhead. It's the police.

344
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,964
You won't hurt me.

345
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,882
Yeah? Why not?

346
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:02,303
Because you're a policeman.
There are rules for policemen.

347
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,890
Yeah, that's what my captain
keeps telling me.

348
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,751
Bet your ass I wish to proceed.

349
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,043
Nine million terrorists in the world

350
00:38:57,126 --> 00:39:00,213
and I gotta kill one with feet
smaller than my sister.

351
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:54,309
I wanted this to be professional,
efficient, adult, cooperative.

352
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,185
Not a lot to ask.

353
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,479
Mr Takagi did not see it that way

354
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:02,233
so he won't be joining us
for the rest of his life.

355
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,487
We can go any way you want it.

356
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,366
You can walk out of here or be carried out,

357
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:14,495
but have no illusions - we are in charge.

358
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:19,876
So... decide now, each of you,

359
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:22,045
and please remember,

360
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,632
we have left nothing to chance.

361
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,308
Get them back!

362
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,612
"Now I have a machine gun."

363
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,533
"Ho... ho... ho."

364
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,497
A security guard we missed?

365
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:03,002
They're usually tired, old policemen.
No, this is something else.

366
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:07,423
<i>Was hab' ich dir gesagt?
lch will, daB es keiner sieht.</i>

367
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,472
We have to do something, Hans.

368
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,807
Yes, we do.

369
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:20,395
Tell Karl his brother is dead.
Tell him to come down.

370
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,232
Karl... <i>komm</i> soforz'.

371
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:28,027
Franco, Fritz,
take the body upstairs and out of sight.

372
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:31,739
I don't want the hostages
to think too much.

373
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,908
<i>Komm sofort. Schnell.</i>

374
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,013
I want blood!

375
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:40,183
You'll have it, but let
Heinrich plant the detonators

376
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,852
and Theo prepare the vault.
After we call the police,

377
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:46,105
you can tear the building apart
looking for this man,

378
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:49,025
but, until then, do not alter the plan!

379
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,694
And if he alters it?

380
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,367
<i>What do you think?</i>

381
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,455
Something's wrong.

382
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,873
COpS?

383
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:08,503
- John.
- John?

384
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:12,090
He can fuck this up.
What does he think he's doing?

385
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,424
His job.

386
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:17,178
Bullshit. His job's 3,000 miles away.

387
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:21,557
Without him, we still have
a chance to get out of here.

388
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,976
Tell that to Takagi.

389
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,919
Mayday, anyone copying channel nine.

390
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:54,006
<i>Terrorists have seized the Nakatomi
building and are holding 30 people hostage.</i>

391
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,217
I repeat.
Unknown number of terrorists,

392
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,637
six or more armed with
automatic weapons at Nakatomi Plaza,

393
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,721
Century City.

394
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,683
Where's the best place to transmit?

395
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,768
The roof! Go! Go!

396
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,107
It's the same address
as that fire signal.

397
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,568
I'll handle it.

398
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:19,365
Attention, whoever you are, this channel
is reserved for emergency calls only.

399
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:22,577
<i>No shit!
Do I sound like I'm ordering a pizza?</i>

400
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,301
No one kills him but me.

401
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,095
They have already killed one hostage.

402
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:44,724
They're fortifying their positions
while you're jerkin' me off!

403
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:48,477
Sir, I've already told you.
This is a reserved channel.

404
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:52,315
If this is an emergency call,
dial 911 on your telephone.

405
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:56,027
Otherwise, I'll report this as an FCC violation.

406
00:44:56,110 --> 00:45:00,031
Fine! Come the fuck down here
and arrest me! Just send the police now!

407
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:17,131
See if a black-and-white can drive by.

408
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:32,355
Thought you guys just ate doughnuts.

409
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:35,149
- They're for my wife.
- Yeah.

410
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:39,153
- She's pregnant.
- Yeah.

411
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,155
Bag it.

412
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:43,991
Big time.

413
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,371
Thanks.

414
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:53,793
<i>Dispatch to 8-Lincoln-30. Over.</i>

415
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,836
This is 8-LinC0ln-30.

416
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,216
<i>Investigate a code two
at Nakatomi Plaza, Century City.</i>

417
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:04,262
8-Lincoln-30 to Dispatch. I'm on my way.

418
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:03,756
Girls.

419
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,218
<i>...auf dem Dachboden.</i>

420
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,565
Shit! Where the fuck is it?

421
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,548
Oh, my God.

422
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:03,607
He's in the elevator shaft.

423
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:07,611
Perfect. The elevators are locked off.
He can't escape.

424
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:09,405
Shut him in and come back down.

425
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,535
Oh, fuck.

426
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:24,795
Karl, the police are probably
on their way already. Karl?

427
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,067
Christ.

428
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:54,617
I can stall them,
but not if they hear gunshots.

429
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,244
<i>If you lock him in, he'll be neutralised...</i>

430
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:06,021
Come out to the coast!
We'll get together, have a few laughs.

431
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,864
Now I know what a TV dinner feels like.

432
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,376
<i>Such!</i>

433
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,726
<i>Karl, komm! Die Polizei!</i>

434
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,603
<i>Karl, die Polizei!</i>

435
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,483
Well, it's about time.

436
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:21,532
No signs of disturbance, Dispatch.

437
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:25,869
<i>Roger. Possible crank call.
Check the area again and confirm.</i>

438
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:34,586
Who's driving this car - Stevie Wonder?

439
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:41,301
I do see a guard inside.
I'm gonna go in for a closer look.

440
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,761
<i>Use caution.</i>

441
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,391
Eddie?

442
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,768
I had a feelin' you'd be calling.

443
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:15,878
Evenin', officer. What can I do for you?

444
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:22,259
<i>Wieviele sind es?</i>

445
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,094
<i>Nur ein Mann.</i>

446
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:29,224
We had that false alarm.

447
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:33,479
You ask me, that goddamn computer
sent you on another wild-goose chase.

448
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:37,065
They been chasing bugs
ever since they installed it.

449
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:39,443
<i>..Notre Dame on top of USC.</i>

450
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,278
Aw, shit!

451
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,989
I got 5O bucks bet on them assholes.

452
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:49,787
Come on, come on,
where's the fuckin' cavalry?

453
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:06,595
<i>Marco, er ist am 34. Geh, schnell, 34.</i>

454
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:12,726
<i>Bah!</i>

455
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,604
<i>..was good for 52 yards.</i>

456
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,815
Mind if I look around?

457
00:55:17,898 --> 00:55:19,274
Help yourself.

458
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:25,155
<i>27 seconds left in this first period.
Seven to nothing, Notre</i> Dame.

459
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:32,079
- Freeze, motherfucker! Drop it!
- Don't shoot!

460
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,957
- Put the gun down!
- OK! Don't shoot!

461
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,208
Drop that fuckin' gun!

462
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:37,793
Marco, down!

463
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,395
Ah, to hell with this!

464
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,155
You are done!

465
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:10,325
No more table! Where are you going, pal?

466
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,663
Next time you have a chance
to kill someone, don't hesitate.

467
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,964
Thanks for the advice.

468
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:27,718
- Sorry to waste your time.
- No problem at all.

469
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,470
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

470
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,612
Oh, for the love...

471
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:51,909
8-Lincoln-30 to Dispatch.

472
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:53,076
<i>Go ahead.</i>

473
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:57,664
A wild-goose chase at Nakatomi Plaza.
Everything here's OK. Over.

474
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,382
Shit!

475
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:09,217
Goddamn it! Jesus H Christ!

476
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,977
Welcome to the party, pal!

477
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:29,404
Get someone here now!

478
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:32,032
Policeman under automatic
rifle fire at Nakatomi!

479
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,159
I need backup assistance now!

480
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:36,828
Now, goddamn it! Now!

481
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,392
Monica, I can get us a table.

482
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,520
Wolfgang and I are very close friends.

483
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,271
I interviewed him!

484
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:05,065
<i>..Nakatomi.</i>

485
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,818
<i>Repeat. Officer needs assistance at...</i>

486
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:11,613
<i>I'm at Nakatomi Plaza.
They're turning my car into Swiss cheese!</i>

487
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:15,742
<i>I need backup assistance now!
Now, goddamn it! Now!</i>

488
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,557
Never thought I'd love to hear that sound.

489
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:43,311
All of you relax. This is a matter
of inconvenient timing, that's all.

490
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:48,150
Police action was inevitable...
and, as it happens, necessary.

491
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:53,405
So, let them fumble about outside
and stay calm. This is simply the beginning.

492
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:58,535
I told you all I wanted radio silence until...

493
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,329
I'm sorry, Hans. I didn't get that message.

494
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:04,791
<i>Maybe you should have put it
on a bulletin board.</i>

495
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:07,419
I figured since I waxed Tony,
Marco and his friend,

496
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:12,340
you and Karl and Franco might be lonely
so I wanted to give you a call.

497
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:15,969
How does he know so much about us?

498
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:18,555
That's very kind of you.

499
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:22,225
<i>I assume you are
our mysterious party crasher.</i>

500
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:25,896
You are troublesome
for a security guard.

501
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,774
Eeeh! Sorry, Hans. Wrong guess.

502
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:34,488
Would you like to go for double jeopardy
where the scores can really change?

503
00:59:36,782 --> 00:59:39,159
Mm, these are very bad for you.

504
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:43,914
- Who are you, then?
- Just the fly in the ointment, Hans.

505
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:47,417
The monkey in the wrench,
the pain in the ass.

506
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,546
Whoa!

507
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,050
Check on all the others. Don't use the radio.

508
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:59,304
See if he's lying about Marco
and find out if anyone else is missing.

509
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:05,018
Mr Mystery Guest...

510
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:07,854
are you still there?

511
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:13,068
Yeah, I'm still here, unless you
wanna open the front door for me.

512
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,070
No, I'm afraid not,

513
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,948
but you have me at a loss.

514
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,783
You know my name, but who are you?

515
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:24,037
<i>Just another American
who saw too many movies as a child?</i>

516
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:27,290
<i>Another orphan of a bankrupt culture</i>

517
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:31,711
<i>who thinks he's John Wayne,
Rambo, Marshal Dillon?</i>

518
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:37,092
I was always partial to Roy Rogers, actually.
I liked those sequinned shirts.

519
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:40,428
Do you really think you have
a chance against us, Mr Cowboy?

520
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:45,892
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

521
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,773
I'll beat everyone if I get a remote.

522
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:53,650
I don't have the new pages.

523
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,986
Harvey, keep your pants on.

524
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,821
Sam, I'm begging Yo"-

525
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:01,116
Simon's with the remote.
I'll tell him to swing by.

526
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,034
I won't sit on this!

527
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:05,912
This is my story! I'm going out there!

528
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:09,916
Look, Sam. Tell you what.
You don't give me a truck, I'll steal a truck.

529
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,419
- Give us a break, Thornburg.
- Eat it, Harvey!

530
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:15,088
...four, three, two,

531
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:16,506
0H3.

532
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,925
Harvey, we're on the air.

533
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:25,765
Good evening. This is Harvey Johnson.

534
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,395
<i>And I'm</i> Gail <i>Wallens.
This is Nightline News at Ten.</i>

535
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:33,273
Our top stories on this Christmas Eve...

536
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:36,526
Take truck number five and get outta here.

537
01:01:44,326 --> 01:01:47,746
He wasn't lying about Marco.
He's down on the street.

538
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:50,123
The other man was Heinrich,

539
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,751
and his bag is missing.

540
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:56,421
He had the detonator.

541
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:02,219
Theo.

542
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:03,345
<i>Theo.</i>

543
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,971
Yo!

544
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:08,725
<i>We may have some problems.
How's our schedule?</i>

545
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:14,356
- Three down, four to go.
- Then don't waste time talking to me.

546
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:17,400
This is Sergeant Al Powell
of the LA Police Department.

547
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:22,530
If the person who radioed can hear me,
acknowledge this transmission.

548
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:23,657
I say again,

549
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:27,077
if the person who radioed
for help can hear me,

550
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,621
acknowledge this transmission!

551
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:36,544
I read you, pal. You the guy in the car?

552
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:38,588
What's left of him.

553
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:42,133
<i>- Can you identify yourself?
- Not now.</i> Maybe <i>later.</i>

554
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:46,304
This is a party line.
The neighbours got itchy trigger fingers.

555
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:49,849
Here's the deal. You got 30 or so
hostages on the 30th floor.

556
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,351
<i>The leader's name is Hans.</i>

557
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:54,104
We have to shut him up.
He's telling them everything!

558
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,273
Let him. I'm waiting for the FBI.

559
01:02:56,356 --> 01:03:00,819
He can waste as much time as he likes
but we must find the bag.

560
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:04,364
- <i>They have</i> a <i>freakin' arsenal here.</i>
<i>- We must</i> have <i>the detonators.</i>

561
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:09,536
<i>They got missiles and enough plastic
explosives to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.</i>

562
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,455
They're down to nine,
counting the skydiver you met.

563
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:17,877
These guys are mostly European,
judging by their clothing labels, and...

564
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,343
cigarettes.

565
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:27,971
They're well-financed and very slick.

566
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,723
How do you know that?

567
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,558
I've seen enough phoney IDs

568
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:35,478
to recognise the ones they got
must have cost a fortune.

569
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,191
Add all that up, I don't know what it means,

570
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:43,862
but you got some bad-ass perpetrators
and they're hereto stay.

571
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:50,410
I hear you, partner. LA's finest are on it,
so light 'em if you got 'em.

572
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:53,288
Way ahead of you, partner.

573
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,957
<i>So what do I call you?</i>

574
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:58,585
Call me...

575
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:01,296
Roy.

576
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:06,384
Listen up, Roy, if you think of anything else,
don't be shy, OK?

577
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:10,430
In the meantime, find a safe place
and let us do our job. Understand?

578
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,807
<i>They're all yours, AI.</i>

579
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,535
Who's talking to 'em?

580
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:35,663
I am, sir. Sergeant Powell. Al Powell.

581
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:40,168
Dwayne Robinson. What's the deal?
What do these pricks want?

582
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:44,506
If you mean the terrorists,
we haven't heard from them.

583
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:47,425
Who have you been talking to?

584
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:50,387
We don't know. He won't give us his name.

585
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,056
But he appears to be the one who phoned.

586
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:56,434
He's killed one terrorist
and claims he capped off two others.

587
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:58,561
He claims?

588
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:02,482
Powell, has it occurred to you
he could be one of the terrorists,

589
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:04,317
or some nutcase in there?

590
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:07,487
I don't think so. In fact, I think he's a cop,

591
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,365
maybe not LAPD,
but he's definitely a badge.

592
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:13,701
- How do you know that?
- A hunch. Things he said -

593
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:16,579
like being able to spot a phoney ID.

594
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:18,748
Jesus Christ, Powell!

595
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:21,334
He could be a bartender for all we know!

596
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:23,795
TV's here.

597
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:25,505
Oh, shit.

598
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:46,443
- I have a request.
- What idiot put you in charge?

599
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:48,486
You did...

600
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:53,741
when you murdered my boss.
Now everybody's looking to me.

601
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:58,955
Personally, I'd pass on the job.
I don't enjoy being this close to you.

602
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:08,256
Go on.

603
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,300
We have a pregnant woman.

604
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:13,303
Relax. She's not due for a couple of weeks,

605
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:16,556
but sitting on that rock
isn't doing her back any good.

606
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:21,811
So I would like permission to move her
to an office with a sofa.

607
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:24,814
No, but I'll have a sofa
brought out. Good enough?

608
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:26,691
Good enough.

609
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:32,447
And unless you like it messy, I'd start
bringing us in groups to the bathroom.

610
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:36,117
Yes. You're right. It will be done.

611
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:40,163
Was there something else?

612
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,248
No, thank you.

613
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:51,966
Mr Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?

614
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:54,177
Gen nero.

615
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,430
<i>Ms</i> Gennero.

616
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:02,644
<i>We interrupt this programme
for a special bulletin.</i>

617
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:06,606
<i>This is Richard Thornburg
live from Century City.</i>

618
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:11,945
<i>Tonight, Los Angeles has joined
the sad and worldwide fraternity of cities</i>

619
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,030
<i>whose only membership requirement</i>

620
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:17,200
<i>is to suffer the anguish
of international terrorism.</i>

621
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:21,663
<i>Approximately two hours ago,
an unidentified group of men</i>

622
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:26,751
<i>seized control of the Nakatomi building,
sealing off all entrances and exits.</i>

623
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:31,130
<i>All telephone lines have been cut
and the only communication now possible</i>

624
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:34,133
<i>has been through the use
of CB communicators</i>

625
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:36,594
<i>which the group brought with them.</i>

626
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:41,182
<i>According to official sources,
the perpetrators of this building siege...</i>

627
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:43,935
<i>Unit five, hold your position.</i>

628
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:48,314
We got Charlie unit in position
by the parking structure.

629
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:52,443
Let me ask you... does
this stairway go up to the escalator?

630
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:55,572
- Yeah.
- Tell them to go ahead.

631
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:58,616
What's going on?

632
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,868
What's it look like? We're going in.

633
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:05,790
Going in? That's crazy! There could be
over 30 hostages in there for all we know.

634
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:07,792
We don't know shit, Powell.

635
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:11,254
If there's hostages, how come
there are no ransom demands?

636
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:14,632
If there's terrorists in there,
where's their list of demands?

637
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,926
All we know is that
somebody shot your car up.

638
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:21,306
It's probably the same silly son of a bitch
you've been talking to on that radio.

639
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:23,016
Excuse me, sir,

640
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:26,394
but what about the body
that fell out the window?

641
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:29,522
- Maybe a stockbroker got depressed.
- We're ready.

642
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:31,941
- Light 'em up. Let's go.
- Hit your lights.

643
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:34,944
- Blue units, go.
- Lights on!

644
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:49,125
Powell?

645
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:51,919
Powell, you still with me, babe?
What's going on?

646
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:53,963
Yo, AI.

647
01:08:54,047 --> 01:08:57,800
I'm here, Roy, but I'm busy right now.
I'll talk to you later.

648
01:08:57,884 --> 01:09:00,595
- <i>Al, what's</i> wrong?
<i>- I'll talk to you later.</i>

649
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:05,850
If you are what I think you are,
you'll know when to listen, shut up, and...

650
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,811
and when to pray.

651
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:11,105
Jesus Christ! You're coming in, right?

652
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:14,692
I told you what kind
of people you're dealing with!

653
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:17,070
Let's load them up.

654
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,950
They'll be coming. Everyone get ready.

655
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:26,496
<i>Theo, you are the eyes now.</i>

656
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,259
- Rivers.
- Yo.

657
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:43,137
Begin your reconnoitre.

658
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:45,139
Let's go.

659
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:49,936
Shit!

660
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:11,124
Come on. Let's go.

661
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:22,844
Ow! Jesus!

662
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,338
All right, spread out.

663
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:27,158
Shut up.

664
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:30,536
Let's go.

665
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:37,084
You macho assholes. No! No!

666
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:41,798
Ahem... all right.

667
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:43,883
Listen up, 9W5-

668
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:48,471
'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house,

669
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:51,015
not a creature was stirring, except

670
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:55,937
the four assholes coming in the rear
in standard two-by-two cover formation.

671
01:11:58,356 --> 01:11:58,773
We're all set.

672
01:11:58,773 --> 01:11:58,856
We're all set.

673
01:11:58,856 --> 01:11:59,649
We're all set.

674
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:02,985
We're ready.

675
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:04,403
Kick ass.

676
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:05,613
Go!

677
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:07,865
Right. Let's do it.

678
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,757
Take cover!

679
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:26,676
They're shooting at 'em.

680
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:30,763
- It's panic fire. They can't see anything.
- They're shooting at the lights.

681
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:38,604
They're going after the lights. Call them back.

682
01:12:39,564 --> 01:12:40,982
It's not happening.

683
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,275
Mike, burn it.

684
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,988
Don't be impatient.

685
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,240
<i>Just wound them.</i>

686
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:55,288
- Get them back. They're sitting ducks.
- They're almost in.

687
01:12:55,413 --> 01:12:58,124
Send in the car. Send in the car.

688
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:12,972
Jesus Christ!

689
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,853
Rivers, Rodriguez, report.

690
01:13:18,936 --> 01:13:21,856
Wait a minute.
What have we here, gentlemen?

691
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:28,571
The police have themselves an RV.

692
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,202
Southeast corner.

693
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:50,176
Oh, Jesus Christ.

694
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:04,815
Get back! Get the fuck back!

695
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:07,735
Get over there.

696
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:09,236
<i>Schnell! Schnell!</i>

697
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,447
<i>Mach schnell!</i>

698
01:14:14,325 --> 01:14:16,202
<i>Weiter! Weiter! Weiter!</i>

699
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,162
<i>Mach schnell! Mach schnell!</i>

700
01:14:18,245 --> 01:14:19,413
<i>Weiter!</i>

701
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:23,960
<i>Mach los! Mach los!</i>

702
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:44,897
I see him!

703
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:58,202
- Feuer!
- Clear!

704
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:07,211
Oh, my God! The quarterback is toast!

705
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:10,381
Hang on, Rivers. That's an order.

706
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:12,591
Hit it again.

707
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:15,928
All right, you made your point!
Let 'em pull back!

708
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:18,514
Thank you. I'll take it under advisement.

709
01:15:19,223 --> 01:15:20,891
Hit it again.

710
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,656
Fire.

711
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:52,173
Fuck me.

712
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:54,842
Get them out of the car! They're burning!

713
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:05,728
Fuck it.

714
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,232
<i>Mach schnell! Mach los!</i>

715
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:21,744
Let's see you take this
under advisement, jerkweed.

716
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:27,374
Geronimo, motherfucker.

717
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,144
Oh, Shit!

718
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:56,695
- They're using artillery on us!
- You idiot, it's not the police.

719
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:58,489
It's him.

720
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:07,289
Holy shit.

721
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:14,630
My God!

722
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,218
- Tell me you got that.
- I got it.

723
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:23,055
Eat your heart out, Channel 5.

724
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:27,143
<i>We've had an update on the terrorist
takeover of the Nakatomi building.</i>

725
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:31,480
<i>Sources say the terrorist leader, Hans,
may be this man, Hans Gruber.</i>

726
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:34,483
<i>A member of the radical
West German Volksfrei movement.</i>

727
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:38,362
<i>The Volksfrei leadership
issued a communique an hour ago,</i>

728
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:41,240
<i>stating that Gruber had been
expelled from that organisation.</i>

729
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,701
<i>AI, do you copy?</i>

730
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:46,036
Are you all right?

731
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,496
Yeah, I'm fine.

732
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:49,957
W-what was that?

733
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,960
<i>Remember that plastic
explosive I told you about?</i>

734
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:55,963
There you go. ls the building on fire?

735
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:59,550
No, but it's gonna need a paint job
and a shitload of screen doors.

736
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:02,386
Our spotter said you got two with that blast.

737
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:05,014
- Is that him?
- Yes, sir.

738
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,310
I don't know who you think you are,

739
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:11,854
but you just destroyed a building.

740
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:15,024
<i>We do not want your help. ls that clear?</i>

741
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:16,942
<i>We don't want your help.</i>

742
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:20,112
<i>I've got 100 people down here
covered with glass.</i>

743
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:24,158
Glass? Who gives a shit about glass?
Who the fuck is this?

744
01:18:25,784 --> 01:18:28,454
This is Deputy Chief of Police
Dwayne T Robinson,

745
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:30,497
and I am in charge of this situation.

746
01:18:30,581 --> 01:18:32,374
Oh, you're in charge?

747
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,460
I got some bad news for you, Dwayne.

748
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:37,838
<i>From up here it doesn't look
like you're in charge of shit.</i>

749
01:18:37,922 --> 01:18:40,007
Listen to me, you little asshole...

750
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:40,966
<i>Asshole?</i>

751
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:44,762
I'm not the one who just got buttfucked
on national TV, Dwayne.

752
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,096
Ah-ha-ha!

753
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:47,973
<i>Listen to me, jerk-off,</i>

754
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:51,060
<i>if you're not part of the solution,
you're part of the problem.</i>

755
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:55,147
<i>Quit being part of the problem
and put the other guy back on!</i>

756
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:58,859
Hey, Roy, how you feeling?

757
01:18:58,943 --> 01:19:00,945
Pretty fucking unappreciated, Al.

758
01:19:01,028 --> 01:19:03,280
<i>Hey, look. I love you.</i>

759
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:05,574
<i>So do a lot of the other guys.</i>

760
01:19:05,658 --> 01:19:08,285
So hang in there, man, you hear me?

761
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:10,287
You hang in there.

762
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:14,333
Yeah, thanks, partner.

763
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:21,632
What are you doing?

764
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:25,511
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see
who gets us killed first,

765
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:27,096
them or your husband.

766
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:28,764
What are you going to do?

767
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:34,270
I negotiate million-dollar deals for breakfast.
I think I can handle this Euro trash.

768
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:37,231
<i>Hey, sprechen sie</i> talk, huh?

769
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:40,192
If you'd listened to me,
he would be neutralised already.

770
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:43,195
I don't want neutral. I want dead.

771
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:46,448
- Hope I'm not interrupting.
- What does he want?

772
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:50,202
It's not what I want. It's what I can give you.

773
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,962
Look, let's be straight, OK?

774
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:04,675
You're not some dumb schmuck
up here to snatch a few purses.

775
01:20:04,758 --> 01:20:06,385
You're very perceptive.

776
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:10,973
I watch 60 Minutes.
I say to myself, these guys are professional,

777
01:20:11,056 --> 01:20:13,475
they're motivated, they're happening.

778
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:15,144
They want something.

779
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:20,357
I couldn't care less about your politics.
Maybe you're pissed off at the camel jockeys.

780
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:23,360
Maybe it's Northern Ireland.
It's none of my business.

781
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:26,989
- You're here to negotiate, right?
- You're amazing.

782
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:29,408
You figured this all out already?

783
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:31,618
Hey, business is business.

784
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:34,955
You use a gun, I use a fountain pen.
What's the difference?

785
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:37,624
In my terms,
you're here on a hostile takeover.

786
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:42,254
You grab us for some greenmail but didn't
expect a poison pill to be running around.

787
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:43,714
Am I right?

788
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:45,341
Hans,

789
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:48,761
bubbee, I'm your white knight.

790
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:54,767
I must have missed 60 Minutes.
What are you saying?

791
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:59,313
The guy upstairs
who's fucking things up, huh?

792
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:06,445
I can give him to you.

793
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,407
<i>Oh, God...</i>

794
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:14,870
Roy? Roy, you all right?

795
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:19,375
Just trying to fire down
a 1,000-year-old Twinkie.

796
01:21:20,167 --> 01:21:21,668
What do they put in them?

797
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:27,049
Sugar-enriched flour,
partially hydrogenated vegetable oil,

798
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:30,344
polysorbate 60, and yellow dye number five.

799
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:33,889
<i>Just everything a growing boy needs.</i>

800
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:35,849
How many kids you got, Al?

801
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:40,020
<i>As a matter of fact,
my wife is working on our first.</i>

802
01:21:40,104 --> 01:21:44,316
How about you, cowboy?
You got any kids back on your ranch?

803
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:47,236
Yeah.

804
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:48,362
Two.

805
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:52,908
Sure hope I can see them swinging
on a jungle gym with Al Jr someday.

806
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:59,790
<i>Well, now, that's a date,
but you bring the ice cream.</i>

807
01:21:59,873 --> 01:22:02,960
<i>Touching, cowboy. Touching.</i>

808
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:06,547
Or should I call you... Mr McClane?

809
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:10,509
Mr Officer John McClane

810
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,262
of the New York Police Department?

811
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:17,099
Get on the phone to Harry in New York.

812
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:19,518
Get a hold of somebody at Dispatch.

813
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:24,064
Sister Theresa called me
Mr McClane in the third grade.

814
01:22:24,148 --> 01:22:28,527
My friends call me John,
and you're neither, shithead.

815
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:35,117
I have someone who wants to talk to you.
A very special friend

816
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,786
who was with you at the party tonight.

817
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,878
Hey, John boy.

818
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:48,797
Ellis?

819
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,215
<i>Yeah.</i>

820
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:54,261
<i>Listen, John, they're giving me
a few minutes to talk sense into you.</i>

821
01:22:54,344 --> 01:22:57,389
I know you think you're doing your job,

822
01:22:57,473 --> 01:23:00,476
but you're dragging this out.

823
01:23:00,559 --> 01:23:04,104
No one gets out of here until these guys
can talk to the LA police.

824
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:07,608
That won't happen until you stop
messing up the works. Capisce?

825
01:23:13,155 --> 01:23:14,907
Ellis, what have you told them?

826
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:21,580
That we were old friends
and you were my guest at the party.

827
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,624
Ellis, you shouldn't be doing this.

828
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:25,709
Tell me about it.

829
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,300
All right, John, listen.

830
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:36,595
<i>Tell them where the detonators are.</i>

831
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,931
<i>They know people are listening.</i>

832
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:42,935
<i>They want the detonators,
or they're gonna kill me.</i>

833
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,898
John, didn't you hear me?

834
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:52,236
Yeah, I hear you.

835
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:56,865
John, get with the programme!
The police are here now. It's their problem.

836
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:59,493
Tell them where the detonators are!

837
01:23:59,576 --> 01:24:02,621
I'm putting my life on the line for you, pal!

838
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:04,581
<i>Ellis, listen to me carefully.</i>

839
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:05,332
John...

840
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:09,586
Shut up, Ellis! Just shut your mouth!
Put Hans back on the line.

841
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:14,258
<i>Hans, this shithead doesn't know
what kind of man you are, but I do.</i>

842
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:17,803
Then you'll give us what we want
and save your friend's life.

843
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:20,097
You're not part of this equation.

844
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:22,474
Hey, what am I, a Method actor?

845
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:25,894
<i>Babe, put away the gun.
This is radio, not television.</i>

846
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:29,606
Hans, this asshole is not my friend!
I don't know him!

847
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:34,736
Jesus Christ, Ellis! These people
will kill you! Tell them you don't know me!

848
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:37,239
<i>How can you say that after all these years?</i>

849
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:41,159
John? John?

850
01:25:04,558 --> 01:25:06,393
Do you hear that?

851
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:09,271
Talk to me! Where are my detonators?

852
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:11,898
Where are they,
or shall I shoot another one?

853
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:16,403
<i>Sooner or later,
I might get to someone you do care about.</i>

854
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:19,072
Go fuck yourself, Hans.

855
01:25:20,282 --> 01:25:22,367
He just let the guy die.

856
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:26,663
He gave him up. Give me that headset.
That's like pulling the trigger yourself.

857
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:30,417
Can't you see what's happening?
Can't you read between the lines?

858
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:32,794
He did everything he could to save him.

859
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:36,006
If he gave himself up,
they'd both be dead right now!

860
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:38,759
No way, man. They'd be talking to us.

861
01:25:38,842 --> 01:25:42,346
You tell this partner of yours
to stay out of this from now on.

862
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:45,974
Because if he doesn't,
I'm really going to nail his ass.

863
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:49,227
The man is hurting. He is alone, tired,

864
01:25:49,311 --> 01:25:52,981
and he hasn't seen diddly-squat
from anybody here!

865
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:55,567
You're gonna tell me he'll give a damn

866
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:58,820
about what you do to him
if he makes it out of there alive?

867
01:25:58,904 --> 01:26:01,823
Why don't you wake up
and smell what you shovelling?

868
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:03,533
You listen to me, Sergeant.

869
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:07,245
Any time you want to go home,
you consider yourself dismissed.

870
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:10,540
No, sir. You couldn't drag me away.

871
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:13,585
<i>Attention, police.</i>

872
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:15,754
<i>Attention, police.</i>

873
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:18,965
- This is Sergeant Al Powell...
- Give me that.

874
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:22,552
This is Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson.
Who is this?

875
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:25,347
This is Hans Gruber.

876
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:28,934
I assume you realise the futility
of direct action against me.

877
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:30,936
We have no wish for further loss of life.

878
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:34,064
What is it you do wish for?

879
01:26:34,147 --> 01:26:38,402
I have comrades in arms
around the world languishing in prison.

880
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:42,155
The American State Department
enjoys rattling its sabre for its own ends.

881
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,282
Now it can rattle it for me.

882
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:49,871
The following people
are to be released from their captors.

883
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:53,083
In Northern Ireland,
seven members of the New Provo Front.

884
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:57,796
<i>In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders
of Libené de Quebec.</i>

885
01:26:57,879 --> 01:27:01,842
<i>In Sri Lanka, the nine members
of the Asian Dawn.</i>

886
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:03,427
What the fuck?

887
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:05,345
<i>Asian</i> Dawn?

888
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:07,931
I read about them in <i>Time</i> magazine.

889
01:27:08,014 --> 01:27:11,935
When these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free,

890
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:15,230
the hostages in this building
will be taken to the roof

891
01:27:15,313 --> 01:27:19,985
and they will accompany us in helicopters
to LA International Airport

892
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:24,656
where they will be given further instructions.
You have two hours to comply.

893
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:28,201
Wait a minute. Uh, Mr Gruber. This is crazy.

894
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:32,080
I don't have the authority.
Two hours is not enough.

895
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:34,458
Hello? Hello!

896
01:27:36,543 --> 01:27:39,713
Did you get all that?
We got to make some calls.

897
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:41,923
Do you think they'll even try?

898
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:44,009
Who cares?

899
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:48,597
Theo, are we on schedule?

900
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,599
One more to go, then it's up to you.

901
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:54,102
You better be right,
because the last one will take a miracle.

902
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:55,771
It's Christmas, Theo.

903
01:27:55,854 --> 01:27:58,398
It's the time of miracles,
so be of good cheer

904
01:27:58,482 --> 01:28:01,276
and call me when you hit the last lock.

905
01:28:01,985 --> 01:28:03,028
Karl,

906
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:06,782
hunt that little shit down
and get those detonators.

907
01:28:06,865 --> 01:28:08,950
Fritz is checking the explosives.

908
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:11,745
I'll check the explosives.
You just get the detonators.

909
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,164
Hey, Powell, you out there?

910
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,334
I'm here, John. I'm here.

911
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:20,921
You gotta believe me.
There was nothing I could do.

912
01:28:22,255 --> 01:28:25,008
Well, it's gonna be
both our asses if you're wrong.

913
01:28:25,091 --> 01:28:27,093
I hear you.

914
01:28:32,557 --> 01:28:34,976
Did you catch that bullshit
Hans was running?

915
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,604
<i>It doesn't make sense, man.</i>

916
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:42,943
Don't ask me. I'm just a desk jockey
who was on my way home when you rang.

917
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:46,696
The way you drove that car,
I figured you for the street, Al.

918
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:49,574
<i>In my youth. In my youth.</i>

919
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:54,996
<i>...and author of "Hostage Terrorist,
Terrorist Hostage: A Study in Duality."</i>

920
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:58,625
<i>Dr Hasseldorf, what can we expect
in the next few hours?</i>

921
01:28:58,708 --> 01:28:59,501
<i>Well, Gail,</i>

922
01:28:59,584 --> 01:29:04,506
the hostages should be going through
the early stages of the Helsinki Syndrome.

923
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:06,466
As in Helsinki, Sweden.

924
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:08,134
<i>Finland.</i>

925
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:11,847
Basically, it's when the hostages
and the terrorists

926
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:16,768
go through a psychological transference
and a projection of dependency.

927
01:29:16,852 --> 01:29:19,688
<i>A strange sort of trust and bond develops.</i>

928
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:24,776
<i>We've had situations where the hostages
have embraced their captors after release</i>

929
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:27,070
<i>and even corresponded with them in prison.</i>

930
01:29:27,404 --> 01:29:30,198
No, no, darling. Asian Dawn. Dawn.

931
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:33,201
D-a-w-n.

932
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:34,786
- Sir?
- Yeah?

933
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:36,788
Sir, the FBI is here.

934
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:40,667
- The FBI is here now?
- Yes, sir. Right over there.

935
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,085
Hold this.

936
01:29:42,168 --> 01:29:44,421
Want a breath mint?

937
01:29:48,425 --> 01:29:50,802
How you doin', man?

938
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:53,513
I'm Agent Johnson.
This is Special Agent Johnson.

939
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:56,933
- Oh, how you doing?
- No relation.

940
01:29:57,017 --> 01:29:58,351
I'm, uh...

941
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:03,607
I'm Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.
I'm in charge here.

942
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:05,734
Not any more.

943
01:31:00,497 --> 01:31:04,042
Hi, there. How you doing?

944
01:31:07,379 --> 01:31:08,380
Ohh...

945
01:31:10,006 --> 01:31:13,176
Please, God. No.
You're one of them, aren't you?

946
01:31:13,259 --> 01:31:14,761
You're one of them.

947
01:31:14,844 --> 01:31:17,722
No! Don't kill me! Please!

948
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:20,266
Don't kill me, please! Please, please!

949
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:23,144
Whoa. Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.

950
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:24,896
I'm not gonna hurt you!

951
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,067
Oh, God.

952
01:31:32,529 --> 01:31:35,740
What are you doin' up here?
What were you lookin' for?

953
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:38,243
I managed to get out of there and...

954
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:41,454
I was just trying to get up on the roof...

955
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:44,249
and see if I could signal for help.

956
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:47,877
It's through here. Come and help.

957
01:31:47,961 --> 01:31:51,089
Hold it. Forget the roof.

958
01:31:51,798 --> 01:31:54,634
Forget the roof. They got people all over it.

959
01:31:56,052 --> 01:31:58,513
You wanna stay alive, you stay with me.

960
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:03,435
The best we can figure it,

961
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:07,022
we've got maybe 30 or 35 hostages up there,

962
01:32:07,105 --> 01:32:09,024
probably on the 30th floor,

963
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:12,736
and maybe seven or eight
terrorists up there.

964
01:32:12,819 --> 01:32:14,988
Sounds like an A-7 scenario.

965
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:17,490
Thank you. We'll handle it from here.

966
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:20,368
When we commandeer your men,
we'll try and let you know.

967
01:32:20,452 --> 01:32:23,538
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Such as?

968
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:28,501
What about John McClane?
He's the reason we have any information.

969
01:32:28,585 --> 01:32:32,213
He's also the reason
you're facing seven terrorists, not twelve.

970
01:32:32,297 --> 01:32:34,632
He's inside? Who is he?

971
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:37,635
He might be a cop. We're checking on that.

972
01:32:37,719 --> 01:32:40,388
- One of yours?
- No, no way.

973
01:32:45,935 --> 01:32:46,770
You smoke?

974
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:49,814
Yeah.

975
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:55,737
Thanks.

976
01:32:59,616 --> 01:33:02,494
You don't work for Nakatomi.

977
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:09,667
And if you're not one of them...

978
01:33:11,753 --> 01:33:14,214
I'm a cop from New York.

979
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,674
New York?

980
01:33:16,758 --> 01:33:18,676
Yeah.

981
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:21,596
Got invited to
the Christmas party by mistake.

982
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:22,972
Who knew?

983
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:35,652
Better than being caught
with your pants down, huh?

984
01:33:42,992 --> 01:33:45,703
I'm John McClane.

985
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:47,288
You're, uh...

986
01:33:48,665 --> 01:33:50,333
Clay.

987
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:53,628
Bill Clay.

988
01:33:59,717 --> 01:34:01,845
Know how to use a handgun, Bill?

989
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:07,600
I spent a weekend at a combat ranch.
That game with the guns that shoot red paint.

990
01:34:07,684 --> 01:34:09,936
Probably seems stupid to you.

991
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:12,564
Nope.

992
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:18,486
Time for the real thing, Bill.

993
01:34:25,994 --> 01:34:28,872
All you got to do is pull the trigger.

994
01:34:28,955 --> 01:34:29,539
Come on.

995
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:42,260
<i>33. Stockwerk. Kommt sofort.</i>

996
01:34:48,975 --> 01:34:53,271
Put down the gun
and give me my detonators.

997
01:34:57,734 --> 01:34:59,736
Well, well, well.

998
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:02,155
Hans.

999
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:05,742
Put it down now.

1000
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:12,832
That's pretty tricky with that accent.

1001
01:35:12,916 --> 01:35:16,127
You oughta be on fuckin' TV with that accent.

1002
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:22,050
But what do you want with the detonators?

1003
01:35:22,133 --> 01:35:24,802
I already used all the explosives.

1004
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:29,849
Or did I?

1005
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:34,062
- I'm going to count to three.
- Yeah. Like you did with Takagi?

1006
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:35,855
Oops.

1007
01:35:37,774 --> 01:35:39,108
No bullets.

1008
01:35:39,192 --> 01:35:42,278
What, do you think I'm fucking stupid, Hans?

1009
01:35:42,362 --> 01:35:43,279
You were saying?

1010
01:36:38,126 --> 01:36:39,502
Karl.

1011
01:36:39,585 --> 01:36:41,671
<i>SchieB auf das Fenster.</i>

1012
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:50,305
Shoot the glass!

1013
01:37:23,629 --> 01:37:25,131
Jesus Christ!

1014
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:57,372
Smile, Karl. We're back in business.

1015
01:37:59,957 --> 01:38:03,044
<i>...is the last resort of diplomacy,</i>

1016
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:09,801
<i>then couldn't we say that terrorism
has an equal claim on being that, too?</i>

1017
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:12,011
Tell me you got something.

1018
01:38:12,095 --> 01:38:16,057
McClane's name, badge number,
employment record, vital statistics,

1019
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:18,643
and his family's home address...

1020
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:20,144
right here in LA.

1021
01:38:22,021 --> 01:38:22,772
Whoo!

1022
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:29,654
Go to work.

1023
01:38:29,737 --> 01:38:31,531
Got it.

1024
01:38:43,668 --> 01:38:46,921
God, that man looks really pissed.

1025
01:38:49,215 --> 01:38:51,509
He's still alive.

1026
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:53,886
What?

1027
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:57,807
Only John can drive somebody that crazy.

1028
01:39:13,781 --> 01:39:18,077
Hans, heat up that miracle because
we just broke through on number six,

1029
01:39:18,161 --> 01:39:20,913
and the electromagnetic
came down like an anvil.

1030
01:39:20,997 --> 01:39:26,335
Have a look at what our friends
outside are doing and I'll be right up.

1031
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:32,425
<i>Hey, John.
John McClane, you still with us?</i>

1032
01:39:32,508 --> 01:39:34,343
Yeah.

1033
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:38,764
But all things being equal,
I'd rather be in Philadelphia.

1034
01:39:38,848 --> 01:39:41,225
Chalk up two more bad guys.

1035
01:39:41,309 --> 01:39:44,896
<i>The boys down here will be glad to hear that.</i>

1036
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:46,856
<i>We got a pool going on you.</i>

1037
01:39:46,939 --> 01:39:48,816
What kind of odds am I getting?

1038
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:50,568
<i>You don't want to know.</i>

1039
01:39:50,651 --> 01:39:53,321
Put me down for 20. I'm good for it.

1040
01:39:57,241 --> 01:39:59,911
<i>Hey, pal, you got flat feet?</i>

1041
01:40:02,413 --> 01:40:04,624
What the hell you talking about, man?

1042
01:40:04,707 --> 01:40:07,126
Something had to get you off the street.

1043
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:11,756
<i>What's the matter? You don't think
a desk job is a noble effort for a cop?</i>

1044
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:15,343
<i>No.</i>

1045
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:20,431
I had an accident.

1046
01:40:20,515 --> 01:40:23,601
<i>The way you drive, I can see why.
What'd you do?</i>

1047
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:26,270
Run over your captain's foot with the car?

1048
01:40:30,149 --> 01:40:32,860
I shot a kid.

1049
01:40:32,944 --> 01:40:35,947
<i>He was 13 years old.</i>

1050
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:40,076
<i>It was dark. I couldn't see him.
He had a ray gun, looked real enough.</i>

1051
01:40:43,329 --> 01:40:47,083
When you're a rookie, they teach you
everything about being a cop

1052
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:49,085
except how to live with a mistake.

1053
01:40:53,089 --> 01:40:57,885
<i>Anyway, I just couldn't bring myself
to draw my gun on anybody again.</i>

1054
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:02,932
<i>Sorry, man.</i>

1055
01:41:03,766 --> 01:41:06,477
Hey, man, how could you know?

1056
01:41:08,813 --> 01:41:10,648
I feel like shit anyway.

1057
01:41:13,651 --> 01:41:20,032
Well, this won't matter. The LAPD is
not calling the shots down here any more.

1058
01:41:22,493 --> 01:41:24,161
The Feds?

1059
01:41:24,245 --> 01:41:25,329
You got it.

1060
01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:29,208
Those are the city engineers.

1061
01:41:30,418 --> 01:41:31,919
Wait.

1062
01:41:32,003 --> 01:41:34,714
They're going into the street circuits.

1063
01:41:34,797 --> 01:41:37,008
The guys in suits, I don't know who they are.

1064
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:38,843
That's the FBI.

1065
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:42,513
They're ordering the others
to cut the building's power.

1066
01:41:42,597 --> 01:41:44,557
Regular as clockwork.

1067
01:41:46,434 --> 01:41:48,436
Or a time lock.

1068
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:50,271
Precisely.

1069
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:54,150
The circuits that cannot be cut
are cut automatically

1070
01:41:54,233 --> 01:41:56,986
in response to a terrorist incident.

1071
01:41:57,069 --> 01:41:59,196
You asked for miracles, Theo.

1072
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:02,408
I give you the FBI.

1073
01:42:03,534 --> 01:42:07,705
- I want the building shut down.
- I got a switch...

1074
01:42:07,788 --> 01:42:12,668
I don't care about your switch.
I want it out. Dark! D-a-r-k.

1075
01:42:12,752 --> 01:42:14,295
You can't do it from here.

1076
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:16,797
- Yeah, you could.
- It can't be done from here.

1077
01:42:16,881 --> 01:42:18,591
I could... I got the radio...

1078
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:22,136
You can't do it from here.
It's got to be done from downtown.

1079
01:42:22,219 --> 01:42:26,098
They've gotta take out a whole city grid.
We're talking 10 blocks.

1080
01:42:26,182 --> 01:42:30,019
Ten blocks? Johnson, that's crazy.
There's thousands of people...

1081
01:42:30,102 --> 01:42:32,438
You have to go wider.

1082
01:42:32,521 --> 01:42:37,610
- I need authorisation.
- How about the United States government?

1083
01:42:37,693 --> 01:42:39,737
Lose the grid, or you lose your job.

1084
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:47,745
- Yeah, Central?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

1085
01:42:47,828 --> 01:42:50,164
This is Walt, down at Nakatomi.

1086
01:42:50,247 --> 01:42:55,169
Would it be possible for you
to turn off grid 212?

1087
01:42:55,252 --> 01:42:56,379
<i>Are you crazy?!</i>

1088
01:42:56,462 --> 01:42:59,131
Maybe I should call the mayor.

1089
01:42:59,215 --> 01:43:02,301
No shit it's my ass. I got a big problem here.

1090
01:43:02,385 --> 01:43:04,762
Shut it down now.

1091
01:43:08,057 --> 01:43:10,810
<i>Emergency lighting activated.</i>

1092
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:13,729
Al, talk to me. What's going on here?

1093
01:43:13,813 --> 01:43:15,356
<i>Ask the FBI.</i>

1094
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:20,653
They got the universal terrorist playbook
and they're running it step by step.

1095
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:26,075
It's gonna go. It's gonna go!

1096
01:43:26,492 --> 01:43:27,910
Yes!

1097
01:43:50,808 --> 01:43:52,893
Merry Christmas.

1098
01:43:53,811 --> 01:43:58,941
- They must be pissing in their pants.
- The mayor is gonna have my ass.

1099
01:44:05,948 --> 01:44:07,283
Whoo!

1100
01:44:20,171 --> 01:44:22,423
What are we gonna do now?

1101
01:44:22,506 --> 01:44:27,428
- Arrest them for not paying their electric bill?
- We've shut them down.

1102
01:44:27,511 --> 01:44:30,973
We let them sweat for a while,
then give them helicopters.

1103
01:44:31,056 --> 01:44:33,267
Right up the ass.

1104
01:44:35,853 --> 01:44:37,396
This is Agent Johnson.

1105
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:38,856
No, the other one.

1106
01:44:38,939 --> 01:44:42,234
I want air support
ready to lift off in five minutes.

1107
01:44:42,318 --> 01:44:45,780
Damn right. Fully armed. We're on the way.

1108
01:44:51,702 --> 01:44:53,579
9h, yes!

1109
01:44:55,289 --> 01:44:57,708
I Wish to talk to the FBI.

1110
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:02,421
This is Special Agent Johnson.

1111
01:45:02,505 --> 01:45:06,967
<i>The State Department has arranged
for the return of your comrades.</i>

1112
01:45:07,051 --> 01:45:09,678
Helicopters are en route as you requested.

1113
01:45:09,762 --> 01:45:12,014
<i>I hear you. We'll be ready.</i>

1114
01:45:12,097 --> 01:45:14,517
When he figures out what hit him,
he'll be in a body bag.

1115
01:45:15,392 --> 01:45:18,270
When they touch down, we'll blow the roof.

1116
01:45:18,354 --> 01:45:24,401
By the time they figure it all out,
we'll be sitting on a beach earning 20%.

1117
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:30,991
Ah! Jeez!

1118
01:45:31,075 --> 01:45:32,868
Powell?

1119
01:45:32,952 --> 01:45:34,787
Yo, Powell, you got a minute?

1120
01:45:36,539 --> 01:45:38,249
I'm here, John.

1121
01:45:39,959 --> 01:45:43,504
Listen, I'm starting
to get a bad feeling up here.

1122
01:45:43,587 --> 01:45:45,506
I want you to do something for me.

1123
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:46,882
Um...

1124
01:45:48,425 --> 01:45:52,346
I want you to find my wife.
Don't ask me how. By then you'll know how.

1125
01:45:52,429 --> 01:45:59,103
Uh, I want you to tell her something.
I want you to tell her that...

1126
01:45:59,937 --> 01:46:01,605
um...

1127
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:08,696
Tell her it took me a while to figure out

1128
01:46:08,779 --> 01:46:10,865
what a jerk I've been,

1129
01:46:11,448 --> 01:46:13,450
but, um...

1130
01:46:14,368 --> 01:46:15,369
that...

1131
01:46:19,248 --> 01:46:21,959
that when things started to pan out for her,

1132
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:26,422
I shoulda been more supportive.

1133
01:46:26,505 --> 01:46:27,381
And, uh...

1134
01:46:28,883 --> 01:46:32,052
I just should have been behind her more.

1135
01:46:34,597 --> 01:46:36,599
Oh, shit.

1136
01:46:38,517 --> 01:46:40,644
Tell her that, um...

1137
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:46,150
that she's the best thing
that ever happened to a bum like me.

1138
01:46:48,068 --> 01:46:51,697
She's heard me say "I love you"
a thousand times.

1139
01:46:52,698 --> 01:46:56,660
She never heard me say "I'm sorry."

1140
01:46:56,744 --> 01:47:04,251
I want you to tell her that, Al.
Tell her that John said that he was sorry.

1141
01:47:04,335 --> 01:47:06,253
OK?

1142
01:47:06,337 --> 01:47:07,504
You got that, man?

1143
01:47:07,588 --> 01:47:09,840
<i>Yeah, I got it, John.</i>

1144
01:47:11,175 --> 01:47:14,011
But you can tell her that yourself.

1145
01:47:14,094 --> 01:47:18,182
You just watch your ass
and you'll make it out. You hear me?

1146
01:47:18,265 --> 01:47:20,643
<i>I guess that's up to the man upstairs.</i>

1147
01:47:24,021 --> 01:47:25,522
<i>John?</i>

1148
01:47:26,357 --> 01:47:28,192
<i>John?</i>

1149
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:31,820
What the fuck
were you doing upstairs, Hans?

1150
01:47:33,447 --> 01:47:34,448
<i>John?</i>

1151
01:47:34,531 --> 01:47:37,701
No, Al, listen. Just lay off for a while.

1152
01:47:39,703 --> 01:47:42,456
<i>I gotta go check on something.</i>

1153
01:47:45,334 --> 01:47:47,753
One minute, that's all I'm asking.

1154
01:47:47,836 --> 01:47:49,713
One minute to speak to them.

1155
01:47:49,797 --> 01:47:51,799
All right. Get back. Get back.

1156
01:47:51,882 --> 01:47:54,301
All right, look.

1157
01:47:54,385 --> 01:47:58,514
You let me in right now,
or I call the INS, comprende?

1158
01:48:01,058 --> 01:48:06,313
This is the last time these kids
are gonna have to speak to their parents.

1159
01:48:07,314 --> 01:48:08,691
All right?

1160
01:48:08,774 --> 01:48:10,734
All right. Come on. Come on.

1161
01:48:21,036 --> 01:48:24,707
What were you doing, Hans?
What were you doing?

1162
01:48:47,271 --> 01:48:50,441
Jesus, Mary, mother of God.

1163
01:48:53,902 --> 01:48:56,530
Al, listen to me! It's a double-cross!

1164
01:48:56,613 --> 01:48:58,240
The roof is wired to...

1165
01:49:00,951 --> 01:49:01,994
<i>John?</i>

1166
01:49:04,371 --> 01:49:05,914
<i>John!</i>

1167
01:49:06,248 --> 01:49:08,042
John, come in!

1168
01:49:08,125 --> 01:49:12,254
- Did you get that?
- Something about a double-cross.

1169
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:14,631
Tell me about it.

1170
01:49:20,345 --> 01:49:22,598
We are both professionals.

1171
01:49:24,725 --> 01:49:27,644
<i>This is personal.</i>

1172
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:52,878
They're coming!

1173
01:49:52,961 --> 01:49:54,838
Choppers are coming.

1174
01:49:54,922 --> 01:49:58,258
Time to gather your flock, Miss Gennero.

1175
01:49:58,342 --> 01:50:02,387
<i>Your mom and dad
are very important people.</i>

1176
01:50:02,471 --> 01:50:04,473
<i>They're very brave people.</i>

1177
01:50:04,556 --> 01:50:08,560
<i>ls there something you'd like
to say to them, if they're watching?</i>

1178
01:50:08,644 --> 01:50:11,772
<i>Come home.</i>

1179
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:21,573
Mrs McClane.

1180
01:50:24,868 --> 01:50:28,789
How nice to make your acquaintance.

1181
01:50:31,416 --> 01:50:33,418
On your feet, everyone! To the roof!

1182
01:50:33,502 --> 01:50:36,171
Lock them up there and come right back.

1183
01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:09,246
You should have heard your brother squeal
when I broke his fucking neck!

1184
01:51:12,583 --> 01:51:15,002
What do you figure the breakage?

1185
01:51:15,085 --> 01:51:21,008
I figure we take out the terrorists,
lose 20, 25% of the hostages, tops.

1186
01:51:21,091 --> 01:51:23,552
I can live with that.

1187
01:51:23,635 --> 01:51:25,429
Get this thing on the deck.

1188
01:51:25,512 --> 01:51:28,557
They're expecting transports, not gunships.

1189
01:51:40,402 --> 01:51:42,404
Move it! Come on! Move!

1190
01:51:42,487 --> 01:51:44,072
Come on! Come on!

1191
01:51:44,156 --> 01:51:46,533
Move it!

1192
01:51:46,617 --> 01:51:47,868
Go! Move!

1193
01:51:51,747 --> 01:51:53,165
<i>Theo.</i>

1194
01:51:53,248 --> 01:51:54,833
A little bonus for us.

1195
01:51:54,917 --> 01:51:56,877
Please, sit down. Sit down!

1196
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,713
A policeman's wife might come in handy.

1197
01:51:59,796 --> 01:52:02,299
McClane, I have some news for you.

1198
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:04,635
McClane?

1199
01:52:16,104 --> 01:52:17,397
Move!

1200
01:52:20,067 --> 01:52:20,817
Come on!

1201
01:52:33,622 --> 01:52:35,958
Motherfucker! I'll kill you!

1202
01:52:39,878 --> 01:52:41,338
Armed.

1203
01:52:41,421 --> 01:52:43,465
- The truck?
- The truck.

1204
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:54,685
After all your posturing,
all your little speeches,

1205
01:52:54,768 --> 01:52:57,271
you're nothing but a common thief.

1206
01:52:57,354 --> 01:52:59,856
I am an exceptional thief, Mrs McClane.

1207
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:05,070
And since I'm moving up to kidnapping,
you should be more polite.

1208
01:53:10,701 --> 01:53:12,828
You motherfucker!

1209
01:53:12,911 --> 01:53:16,373
I'm gonna fuckin' cook you,
and I'm gonna fuckin' eat you!

1210
01:53:38,895 --> 01:53:41,064
I don't like this, Sarge.

1211
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:54,703
Yee-hah!
Just like fucking Saigon, eh, Slick?

1212
01:53:56,246 --> 01:53:59,082
I was in junior high, dickhead.

1213
01:54:27,027 --> 01:54:28,487
Where's Holly?

1214
01:54:28,570 --> 01:54:30,030
Where's Holly Gennero?

1215
01:54:30,113 --> 01:54:32,199
Holly Gennero? Where's Holly?

1216
01:54:32,282 --> 01:54:34,159
Where's Holly? Where is she?

1217
01:54:34,242 --> 01:54:35,535
- They took her!
- Where?

1218
01:54:35,619 --> 01:54:36,661
The vault!

1219
01:54:36,745 --> 01:54:38,997
- Where is the vault?
- The 30th floor!

1220
01:54:39,081 --> 01:54:40,999
They just took her!

1221
01:54:41,208 --> 01:54:43,293
Get downstairs!

1222
01:54:43,418 --> 01:54:46,546
The whole fucking roof
is wired to blow! Get down!

1223
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:49,257
Get down! Get the fuck downstairs!

1224
01:54:51,426 --> 01:54:54,346
They made us, Bureau.
You got a terrorist shooting hostages.

1225
01:54:54,429 --> 01:54:56,139
I see him! Break left!

1226
01:55:02,396 --> 01:55:04,064
Nail that sucker!

1227
01:55:12,155 --> 01:55:15,242
I'm on your side, you assholes!

1228
01:55:15,325 --> 01:55:18,453
Swing around again!
I'll bag this little bastard.

1229
01:55:37,347 --> 01:55:39,182
What the fuck...

1230
01:55:41,143 --> 01:55:44,020
Oh, John, what the fuck are you doing?

1231
01:55:44,104 --> 01:55:46,982
How the fuck did you get into this shit?

1232
01:55:56,950 --> 01:56:00,370
There's something wrong!
They're coming back down!

1233
01:56:00,454 --> 01:56:02,622
- Blow the roof.
- But Karl's up there!

1234
01:56:02,706 --> 01:56:04,166
Blow the roof!

1235
01:56:07,377 --> 01:56:13,383
I promise I will never even think
about going up in a tall building again.

1236
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:19,055
Oh, God, please don't let me die!

1237
01:57:50,689 --> 01:57:53,149
Holy Christ!

1238
01:57:54,317 --> 01:57:56,987
We're gonna need
some more FBI guys, I guess.

1239
01:58:09,749 --> 01:58:11,543
Jesus fucking Christ!

1240
01:58:12,502 --> 01:58:13,628
Fuck!

1241
01:58:38,028 --> 01:58:40,530
What the fuck is going on?

1242
01:58:42,449 --> 01:58:47,621
What are you gonna do?
Sit here while the building falls down?

1243
01:58:54,377 --> 01:58:55,253
Shit!

1244
01:58:55,337 --> 01:58:57,213
All right!

1245
01:58:58,673 --> 01:58:59,883
Hey! Hey!

1246
01:59:00,842 --> 01:59:02,636
Hang on, baby.

1247
01:59:02,719 --> 01:59:04,304
Hang on, honey.

1248
01:59:05,347 --> 01:59:06,389
Oh, God.

1249
01:59:51,518 --> 01:59:53,228
<i>Hans'.!</i>

1250
02:00:07,742 --> 02:00:09,494
Jesus.

1251
02:00:09,577 --> 02:00:12,789
Hi, honey.

1252
02:00:33,893 --> 02:00:38,231
So that's what this was all about?
A fuckin' robbery?

1253
02:00:38,314 --> 02:00:41,151
Put down the gun.

1254
02:00:41,234 --> 02:00:43,528
Why'd you have to nuke the whole building?

1255
02:00:43,611 --> 02:00:46,656
Well, when you steal $600,
you can just disappear.

1256
02:00:46,740 --> 02:00:49,743
When you steal 600 million,
they will find you,

1257
02:00:49,826 --> 02:00:52,078
unless they think you're already dead.

1258
02:00:52,162 --> 02:00:54,330
Put down the gun.

1259
02:01:04,799 --> 02:01:07,469
Nein. This is mine.

1260
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:11,556
You got me.

1261
02:01:11,639 --> 02:01:16,186
Still the cowboy, Mr McClane.
Americans... all alike.

1262
02:01:16,269 --> 02:01:20,231
This time, John Wayne does not walk off
into the sunset with Grace Kelly.

1263
02:01:20,315 --> 02:01:24,027
- That was Gary Cooper, asshole.
- Enough jokes.

1264
02:01:24,110 --> 02:01:26,946
You'd have made a pretty
good cowboy yourself, Hans.

1265
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:31,785
Oh, yes. What was it
you said to me before?

1266
02:01:31,868 --> 02:01:35,663
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

1267
02:01:56,726 --> 02:01:57,727
Holly!

1268
02:02:03,316 --> 02:02:04,818
Happy trails, Hans.

1269
02:02:10,323 --> 02:02:11,950
Aah!

1270
02:02:49,487 --> 02:02:51,364
I hope that's not a hostage.

1271
02:03:19,767 --> 02:03:23,771
Gimme water hook-ups
for engine companies 5, 3, 9, 6.

1272
02:03:27,442 --> 02:03:29,527
Over here. It's a better angle.

1273
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:36,784
Keep it going, now. Keep it going.

1274
02:03:41,831 --> 02:03:45,460
- Come on. We're going to miss it!
- OK. Hand me my notes!

1275
02:04:08,483 --> 02:04:12,570
What was it like in there?
How did they treat you?

1276
02:04:58,783 --> 02:05:02,537
Al, this is my wife Holly. Holly Gennero.

1277
02:05:03,287 --> 02:05:05,039
Holly McClane.

1278
02:05:05,123 --> 02:05:06,791
Hello, Holly.

1279
02:05:06,874 --> 02:05:11,504
You got yourself a good man.
You take good care of him.

1280
02:05:11,587 --> 02:05:12,922
McClane!

1281
02:05:13,297 --> 02:05:15,842
McClane, I want a debriefing!

1282
02:05:15,925 --> 02:05:18,636
You got some things to answer for, mister.

1283
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:24,350
Ellis' murder, for one thing. Property damage,
interfering with police business.

1284
02:06:04,682 --> 02:06:07,769
Go inside,
see if there's anybody else!

1285
02:06:18,488 --> 02:06:21,115
No. This one's with me.

1286
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,668
Mr McClane, Mr McClane!

1287
02:06:32,752 --> 02:06:37,673
Now that it's all over and after this
incredible ordeal, what are your feelings?

1288
02:06:42,595 --> 02:06:44,013
Well, well, well.

1289
02:06:44,097 --> 02:06:48,351
- Merry Christmas, Argyle.
- Merry Christmas.

1290
02:06:51,896 --> 02:06:52,939
<i>Did you get that?</i>

1291
02:06:55,525 --> 02:07:00,363
If this is their idea of Christmas,
I gotta be here for New Year's.
