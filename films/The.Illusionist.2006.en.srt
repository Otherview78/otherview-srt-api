1
00:03:49,205 --> 00:03:53,166
It's her! I know it's her!
She wants to tell us something!

2
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,667
We must do something !
Sit down!

3
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,627
Please! Hey!

4
00:04:09,884 --> 00:04:14,221
In the name of his imperial
majesty and the city of Vienna,

5
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:17,681
I hereby arrest eduard
abramovicz,

6
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:20,641
Also known as eisenheim
the illusionist,

7
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:23,935
on charges of disturbing
public order,

8
00:04:24,227 --> 00:04:27,520
Charlatanism and threats
against the empire!

9
00:04:27,812 --> 00:04:30,814
Leave him alone!

10
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,360
They're arresting him !
They're arresting eisenheim!

11
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,084
Chief inspector uhl.

12
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:18,426
- You're late.
- My apologies, your highness.

13
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,469
I was attending to
the loose ends of the case.

14
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,389
- Are there still loose ends?
- Very few.

15
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:28,915
Did he do it again?

16
00:05:30,017 --> 00:05:32,101
How does he do it?

17
00:05:32,393 --> 00:05:34,728
I'm afraid
I still don't know.

18
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,313
Did you ask him?

19
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,857
He's not talking
at this point.

20
00:05:41,148 --> 00:05:44,400
Well, I'm sure
you have... methods...

21
00:05:44,692 --> 00:05:47,193
For that kind of thing.

22
00:05:48,777 --> 00:05:51,571
I want you to put
an end to it.

23
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:53,780
Surely you have
something on him.

24
00:05:54,948 --> 00:05:57,324
Something from his past?

25
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:02,786
Yes. Yes, I think I do.

26
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,333
In fact, we
know all about his life.

27
00:06:14,002 --> 00:06:17,420
We've spoken to almost everyone
who ever knew him.

28
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,800
As a boy, I'm told
he had a chance encounter...

29
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:28,802
With a traveling magician.

30
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:35,556
Boy.

31
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:10,869
One version of the
story was that the man himself...

32
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:13,621
Then vanished...

33
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:16,873
Along with the tree.

34
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:19,041
Who knows
what actually happened?

35
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:37,928
People began to think he had
some kind of special power,

36
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:41,721
or at least that
he was a bit different.

37
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,683
And then he met her.

38
00:07:58,773 --> 00:08:01,483
Don't drop it.
Careful, you're going to trip.

39
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:05,569
Drop it, you muck snipe. Oh !
Watch out for that hole, alley rat!

40
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,695
Drop it!
Come on.

41
00:08:20,453 --> 00:08:22,579
Pick a card.

42
00:08:24,205 --> 00:08:26,832
Put it back in the deck.

43
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,045
Now, watch.

44
00:08:48,053 --> 00:08:51,430
Duchess von teschen, you can't be
in a place like this. They're peasants.

45
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:55,099
Remember who you are.

46
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:26,243
She was
brought back to the castle...

47
00:09:26,535 --> 00:09:28,327
And they were forbidden
to see each other.

48
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:32,247
But soon,
they were doing just that.

49
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,707
Over the next few years, they could
always find a way to be together.

50
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,209
Quick, come on.

51
00:09:43,837 --> 00:09:46,964
In china there's a magician
that could make anything disappear--

52
00:09:47,256 --> 00:09:49,424
A house, a wagon, anything.

53
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:53,968
We'll go visit him. They can't
stop us if we want to be together.

54
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,428
They'll never find us.

55
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,638
Do you promise
you'll take me with you?

56
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,140
One day I will.

57
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:05,933
One day
we'll run away together.

58
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:08,059
We'll disappear.

59
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:38,059
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

60
00:10:46,374 --> 00:10:49,293
There's a secret way
to open it.

61
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:03,636
I wanted a picture.

62
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:25,148
Sophie, are you there?

63
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:31,694
We must hurry! They're coming !
Duchess von teschen!

64
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:36,822
Duchess von teschen!

65
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:41,158
Duchess von teschen ! Duchess von teschen!

66
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:47,286
Make us disappear.
Make us disappear.

67
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:49,788
Duchess von teschen!

68
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:56,501
Stop. Stop.

69
00:12:02,462 --> 00:12:04,464
Don't do this.
Let go!

70
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:08,424
- Let me go. Let go!
- Your father's waiting for you.

71
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:11,885
Let go! No!

72
00:12:12,177 --> 00:12:14,303
- Eduard !
- Please, let go!

73
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:16,638
- No!
- Let me go!

74
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,598
Let her go, please!

75
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,392
Let go! Stop it!
Sophie!

76
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:25,351
Eduard!

77
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:27,353
Sophie!
Eduard!

78
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:29,980
Sophie.

79
00:12:30,272 --> 00:12:32,147
Stay away from
her, or next time...

80
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:35,108
We'll arrest you
and your family.

81
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,991
What happened
next remains a mystery.

82
00:12:48,282 --> 00:12:50,950
We do know that
he traveled the world,

83
00:12:51,242 --> 00:12:53,910
that he began to perform
his magic in public,

84
00:12:54,202 --> 00:12:56,745
that he changed his name
to eisenheim.

85
00:12:58,997 --> 00:13:02,207
And then almost

86
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:04,333
he appeared in Vienna.

87
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:13,630
Life and death,

88
00:13:13,922 --> 00:13:17,133
space and time,

89
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:20,260
fate and chance.

90
00:13:20,552 --> 00:13:23,928
These are the forces
of the universe.

91
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,763
Tonight,
ladies and gentleman,

92
00:13:27,055 --> 00:13:32,559
I present to you a man who has
unlocked these mysteries.

93
00:13:32,851 --> 00:13:34,685
From the furthest corners
of the world...

94
00:13:34,977 --> 00:13:38,521
Where the dark arts
still hold sway,

95
00:13:38,813 --> 00:13:41,481
he returns to us
to demonstrate...

96
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:45,692
How nature's laws
may be bent.

97
00:13:45,984 --> 00:13:49,777
I give you... eisenheim.

98
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:02,201
Might I borrow a handkerchief
from someone?

99
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,079
You, madam.

100
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:23,923
Thank you.

101
00:14:24,215 --> 00:14:27,009
Ah, be patient.

102
00:14:27,301 --> 00:14:29,177
Now, if you please.

103
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:35,180
I would like to continue
with an examination of time.

104
00:14:35,472 --> 00:14:39,725
From the moment we enter
this life, we are in the flow of it.

105
00:14:40,017 --> 00:14:44,478
We measure it and we mark it,
but we cannot defy it.

106
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,063
We cannot even speed it up
or slow it down.

107
00:14:50,564 --> 00:14:52,566
Or can we?

108
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,109
Have we not each
experienced the sensation...

109
00:14:56,401 --> 00:14:59,820
That a beautiful moment
seemed to pass too quickly...

110
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:02,614
And wished that
we could make it linger?

111
00:15:05,324 --> 00:15:08,450
Or felt time slow
on a dull day...

112
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:12,244
And wished that we could
speed things up a bit?

113
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:21,412
I assure you,
they're quite real.

114
00:16:21,703 --> 00:16:23,663
Is it real? Let's see.

115
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:27,206
And you, madam,
where is your handkerchief?

116
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,226
Bravo!

117
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:02,353
Very good.

118
00:17:05,646 --> 00:17:07,440
Give us something, please.

119
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,275
Please, give us something.
Please. What's all this?

120
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,609
We're poor.

121
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:16,653
Do you think you're poor? Yes.

122
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,405
I want to
show you something.

123
00:17:20,697 --> 00:17:22,407
You're not poor.

124
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:26,492
You have everything
that you need right here.

125
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:28,618
Thank you.

126
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:31,996
Thank you.

127
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,914
Thank you.

128
00:17:36,206 --> 00:17:38,082
And that's yours.

129
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,461
And this too.

130
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:49,423
I've got the magic one!

131
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:03,806
Good morning.
Good morning.

132
00:18:04,098 --> 00:18:05,892
Coffee?
No.

133
00:18:06,183 --> 00:18:09,268
Strudel? I have two.
Nothing, thank you.

134
00:18:12,228 --> 00:18:15,772
You look very pleased with
yourself. How are the receipts?

135
00:18:16,064 --> 00:18:17,940
Not bad. A three-quarter
house. Well done.

136
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:20,442
But we're going to do better
than that. Listen to this.

137
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:24,277
Listen. "There is no argument
that his uncanny displays...

138
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:28,946
"Separate him from the ranks
of garden-variety stage wizards.

139
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:31,865
"Some of his effects
transcend mere illusion...

140
00:18:32,157 --> 00:18:34,992
"And approach
the realm of art.

141
00:18:35,284 --> 00:18:38,203
He is very young
to be so masterful."

142
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:42,205
Do you see? We'll pack
the house with this review.

143
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,706
We are going to make more money
than ever you dreamed of.

144
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,416
But if it was mechanical.

145
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,667
Maybe he had it wrapped
in some kind of bark?

146
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,793
Oh, I know, of course
I thought of that.

147
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:54,046
It's the butterflies
I'm trying to work out.

148
00:18:54,337 --> 00:18:56,589
Oh, for pete's sake.
Invisible wire.

149
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,590
Too obvious. How many men
have you detailed for tonight?

150
00:18:59,882 --> 00:19:02,300
We have eight men inside,
another eight out front.

151
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:04,760
Perhaps you'll get another look
at your butterflies.

152
00:19:05,052 --> 00:19:06,386
Mmm.

153
00:19:10,722 --> 00:19:15,016
Come on in. Check
the last 10 rows there.

154
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:37,696
You ! Don't touch that!

155
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:39,698
Put that down!
Ah, herr eisenheim.

156
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,991
Who are you and what do you
think you're doing?

157
00:19:42,283 --> 00:19:45,576
I'm chief inspector Walter uhl
and I'm inspecting your theater.

158
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:48,537
I've seen you perform.
Very impressive.

159
00:19:48,828 --> 00:19:52,331
Very impressive. How can
we help you, inspector?

160
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:54,958
You will be honored to know
the crown prince...

161
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,042
Plans to attend
your performance tonight.

162
00:19:57,334 --> 00:19:59,210
- The crown prince?
- Yes!

163
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:01,711
So, obviously we have
to inspect the theater.

164
00:20:02,003 --> 00:20:04,004
I think that one's small
for an assassin, don't you?

165
00:20:04,296 --> 00:20:07,715
Yes, the orange tree.

166
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,133
You know, I have seen things
like this before,

167
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:13,760
but never one like that.

168
00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:15,761
Extraordinary.
Thank you.

169
00:20:16,053 --> 00:20:18,805
I have been puzzling
over how it works,

170
00:20:19,097 --> 00:20:22,474
especially how
the butterflies fly.

171
00:20:23,975 --> 00:20:26,810
I assure you,
your secret is safe with me.

172
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:30,979
I'm an officer of the law after
all, and a bit of an amateur conjurer.

173
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,314
Are you really?
Yes.

174
00:20:33,605 --> 00:20:37,525
Well, card tricks, coins,
uh, sleight of hand, yes.

175
00:20:37,817 --> 00:20:39,109
Hmm.

176
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:43,404
But nothing fancy.
Perhaps you'll give me a tip.

177
00:20:45,154 --> 00:20:47,531
Yes, all right.

178
00:20:47,823 --> 00:20:50,241
I'll show you one I'm very fond
of. Are you a gambling man?

179
00:20:50,533 --> 00:20:53,909
On occasion, yes. I will bet you
the secret of the orange tree...

180
00:20:54,201 --> 00:20:57,161
That I can guess which hand
you place this in every time.

181
00:20:57,453 --> 00:20:59,913
Excellent.

182
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:03,708
Put it in your fist, raise your
hand against your forehead,

183
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:06,792
concentrate on it,
form a mental picture.

184
00:21:07,084 --> 00:21:08,794
Yes.
Have you got it?

185
00:21:09,085 --> 00:21:11,588
Yes. Put your hands
in front of you.

186
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:17,465
It's in your left.

187
00:21:17,757 --> 00:21:19,466
Well--
a lucky guess, perhaps.

188
00:21:19,758 --> 00:21:21,719
You have a confederate
who signals you.

189
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,803
No. It's more primitive
than that. Uh-huh.

190
00:21:25,095 --> 00:21:29,098
When you raise your hand to
your head, the blood drains from it.

191
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,224
It will be paler
every time.

192
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:40,021
Oh. Oh, I like that
very much.

193
00:21:40,313 --> 00:21:42,564
Please take it
with my compliments.

194
00:21:42,856 --> 00:21:45,566
Why, thank you.
Eh, the blood drains.

195
00:21:45,858 --> 00:21:49,235
Now, inspector,

196
00:21:49,527 --> 00:21:52,029
If you don't mind, I've got to
prepare for tonight's performance.

197
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,447
Ah.

198
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:07,330
Please stand
for his imperial highness,

199
00:22:07,621 --> 00:22:10,289
crown prince Leopold.

200
00:22:37,514 --> 00:22:41,975
I thought we might end this
evening with a discussion of the soul.

201
00:22:42,267 --> 00:22:44,602
All of the greatest
religions...

202
00:22:44,894 --> 00:22:48,896
Speak of the soul's endurance
beyond the end of life.

203
00:22:49,188 --> 00:22:53,649
So, what then
does it mean... to die?

204
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:57,526
I need a volunteer
from the audience.

205
00:22:57,818 --> 00:23:00,570
Someone not afraid
of death.

206
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:04,906
Please, someone?

207
00:23:05,198 --> 00:23:07,407
I assure you,
no tragedy will befall you.

208
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:39,468
It's an honor,
duchess von teschen.

209
00:23:52,267 --> 00:23:54,686
Do you know me?

210
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:57,604
No.

211
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,357
You're quite certain
that we've never met before?

212
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,192
Yes, of course.

213
00:24:18,617 --> 00:24:21,786
Now please gaze
directly into my eyes.

214
00:24:22,078 --> 00:24:23,995
Look nowhere else.

215
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:02,060
Wave to yourself.

216
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,731
Turn in a circle.

217
00:25:14,317 --> 00:25:16,402
Now bow to yourself.

218
00:25:59,261 --> 00:26:01,346
Away.

219
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:08,220
They must have liked you. They've
waited for you nearly five minutes.

220
00:27:08,512 --> 00:27:12,639
Your highness, may I introduce
eisenheim the illusionist?

221
00:27:17,184 --> 00:27:20,477
Well done. Thank you for
coming. I hope you enjoyed it.

222
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:23,354
Oh, we more than enjoyed it.

223
00:27:23,646 --> 00:27:26,189
Stimulated great debate
amongst us, hasn't it?

224
00:27:26,481 --> 00:27:28,649
Except of course for your
assistant, duchess von teschen.

225
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:31,484
You seemed to have struck her
quite speechless. A feat in itself.

226
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:35,362
Did you hypnotize her?
In a fashion.

227
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:38,488
I'd like to learn that trick.

228
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:43,866
Rainier here thinks you have
supernatural powers.

229
00:27:44,158 --> 00:27:46,159
Do you claim
supernatural powers?

230
00:27:47,536 --> 00:27:49,829
I've never said anything
of that kind.

231
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,789
- Then you won't mind a question or two.
- Now let's not ruin it.

232
00:27:53,081 --> 00:27:56,207
You needn't
divulge anything I can't guess.

233
00:27:56,499 --> 00:27:57,959
As you wish.

234
00:27:58,251 --> 00:28:00,168
Your assistants
are behind the mirror...

235
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,837
Somewhere in robes
obviously.

236
00:28:04,128 --> 00:28:07,464
Lights in the frame perhaps to
illuminate them, or angled mirrors?

237
00:28:07,756 --> 00:28:10,466
That would be one way
to do it.

238
00:28:10,758 --> 00:28:13,260
I think I understand it all
except the ghost.

239
00:28:13,552 --> 00:28:15,427
That was very, very good.

240
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:18,346
Another viewing perhaps?

241
00:28:18,638 --> 00:28:21,556
You must come to the hofburg
next time. We'll make an evening of it.

242
00:28:21,848 --> 00:28:24,224
That will be my pleasure.

243
00:28:24,516 --> 00:28:26,725
I Leopold ]
So be it.

244
00:28:27,017 --> 00:28:29,227
Sophie?

245
00:28:36,357 --> 00:28:39,025
And we'll gather
our best minds next time.

246
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:41,068
You'll really have
a challenge then.

247
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,945
Then I'll prepare
something special.

248
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:46,154
Perhaps
I'll make you disappear.

249
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:01,414
My god.
When he volunteered her,

250
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:05,583
I heard the crashing sound
of money falling on me in piles.

251
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:08,626
Every lady of means in Vienna will
want to get up there with you now.

252
00:29:08,918 --> 00:29:10,669
Mmm.
What a show-off.

253
00:29:10,961 --> 00:29:13,379
His father would have died
if he had seen such a display.

254
00:29:13,671 --> 00:29:17,007
She didn't seem too happy about it
either. She'd better get used to it.

255
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:20,425
How's that? Word is
she'll marry him soon.

256
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,052
Really? Taking her
chances if you ask me.

257
00:29:24,344 --> 00:29:26,804
Why? He likes to
give his lady friends...

258
00:29:27,096 --> 00:29:29,347
A good thrashing
now and again.

259
00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:31,473
People say he pushed one
of them off a balcony...

260
00:29:31,765 --> 00:29:34,475
Just to cover the beating
he'd given her.

261
00:30:02,284 --> 00:30:04,994
For herr eisenheim.

262
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:45,268
[ Hooves beating I

263
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,687
hello, Sophie.

264
00:30:53,523 --> 00:30:57,609
When I was on the stage,
you knew me right away.

265
00:30:57,901 --> 00:31:00,402
It took me a moment,

266
00:31:00,694 --> 00:31:02,904
but, yes, I knew.

267
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:05,447
You could have
said something.

268
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,615
I thought you'd figure
it out eventually.

269
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,866
Yes, I would have.

270
00:31:10,158 --> 00:31:12,409
I would have come another night,
volunteered,

271
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:14,494
walked right on stage
and said, "hello."

272
00:31:14,786 --> 00:31:16,912
And then you'd really
have had to move quickly.

273
00:31:17,204 --> 00:31:19,288
I suspect you would have.

274
00:31:21,873 --> 00:31:23,833
I don't understand why.

275
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:31,964
Perhaps for the same reasons you
find it prudent to meet in a carriage.

276
00:31:32,254 --> 00:31:35,507
It's just a game
I have to play with them.

277
00:31:37,341 --> 00:31:41,844
I'm followed everywhere. It's-- it's
supposed to be for my protection.

278
00:31:44,096 --> 00:31:46,013
Yes.

279
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:50,599
So, I hear congratulations
are in order.

280
00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:53,267
What for?

281
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,686
They say you'll
be the princess.

282
00:31:55,978 --> 00:31:59,146
- It's not decided at all.
- Ah.

283
00:32:00,563 --> 00:32:03,107
It makes a certain sense,
I suppose.

284
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:06,776
We've known each other for
years, and of course, our families.

285
00:32:07,068 --> 00:32:09,361
He's very intelligent.

286
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:12,988
A little too intelligent
for his own good.

287
00:32:16,824 --> 00:32:19,701
You're lucky, you know,

288
00:32:19,993 --> 00:32:22,619
to have broken free
as you did.

289
00:32:24,745 --> 00:32:27,414
I often wish that I had--

290
00:32:30,623 --> 00:32:32,500
Wished what?

291
00:32:35,918 --> 00:32:38,420
Wished that
I would see you again.

292
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:45,299
And now you have.

293
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:51,052
Yes, now I have.

294
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:00,809
I look forward to seeing you
again at the hofburg.

295
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,269
Until then.

296
00:33:27,241 --> 00:33:29,159
Here's the report
on duchess von teschen.

297
00:33:29,451 --> 00:33:31,577
Mmm. Anything interesting?

298
00:33:31,869 --> 00:33:33,704
See for yourself.

299
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:43,334
The magician?

300
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:45,335
They drove around
for half an hour.

301
00:33:45,627 --> 00:33:48,296
Then he got out
near the theater.

302
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:54,382
What do you want us to do?

303
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:14,811
Join us for a drink?

304
00:34:20,482 --> 00:34:22,691
Please.

305
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:35,616
You like something to eat,
something to drink, hmm?

306
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,950
No, thank you.
Herr eisenheim,

307
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:41,745
I'm going to ask you
a question...

308
00:34:42,037 --> 00:34:43,829
That may not seem friendly,

309
00:34:44,121 --> 00:34:47,499
but I assure you, in
fact, is.

310
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,543
What is your relationship
with the duchess von teschen?

311
00:34:53,835 --> 00:34:56,337
You're right,
that doesn't seem friendly.

312
00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:58,838
Oh, but that is
precisely my point.

313
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,633
For, you see,
where others might judge...

314
00:35:02,925 --> 00:35:07,511
A discreet carriage ride
for what it seemed to be,

315
00:35:07,803 --> 00:35:11,262
I am willing to find out
what it actually was.

316
00:35:13,056 --> 00:35:15,682
All right. We were
childhood acquaintances.

317
00:35:15,973 --> 00:35:18,142
Acquaintances?

318
00:35:18,433 --> 00:35:20,519
Childhood friends.

319
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,728
My father was a cabinetmaker.

320
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,438
He made the furniture for
her family's house.

321
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,857
I see, the cabinetmaker's
son friends with a--

322
00:35:30,149 --> 00:35:34,819
- Has there been a complaint?
- Oh, no, no. If there'd been a complaint,

323
00:35:35,111 --> 00:35:38,446
well, we'd be having Avery, uh,
different sort of conversation.

324
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:44,407
Yes. He relies on you for
that sort of thing, does he?

325
00:35:44,699 --> 00:35:47,409
I'm a simple public servant,
herr eisenheim.

326
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:49,536
That's not what I hear.

327
00:35:49,828 --> 00:35:53,288
I hear you'll be the
chief of police very soon.

328
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:57,916
Maybe mayor of Vienna? Party
secretary? All subject to his whim.

329
00:35:58,208 --> 00:36:01,043
You better hope he doesn't dissolve
the parliament before you get there.

330
00:36:01,335 --> 00:36:05,587
Now the prince has some progressive
ideas, but he will make a fine emperor.

331
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:09,422
Well, they say you're very close
to him, so I'm sure you'll do fine.

332
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:15,301
Look. Yes, indeed, they say
that I'm very close to the prince.

333
00:36:15,593 --> 00:36:20,513
But the simple truth of the matter is,
herr eisenheim, I'm the son of a butcher.

334
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:24,640
He's the heir to the empire. How
close could we be to such as him?

335
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:28,518
Hmm? Do you see my point?

336
00:36:32,979 --> 00:36:36,148
Don't fool yourself that
you can play in their game.

337
00:36:38,107 --> 00:36:39,899
I've served
on the edge of it...

338
00:36:40,191 --> 00:36:43,944
For... many, many years,

339
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:46,154
and I can tell you
with certainty,

340
00:36:46,445 --> 00:36:49,573
there's no trick
they haven't seen.

341
00:36:53,283 --> 00:36:56,118
It's not worth it.

342
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,913
My guest tonight...

343
00:37:03,205 --> 00:37:08,208
Is not a showman at all,
but rather a wizard...

344
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,836
Who has sold his soul
to the devil...

345
00:37:12,128 --> 00:37:15,337
In return for unholy powers.

346
00:37:15,629 --> 00:37:18,339
Or so at least some of our
friends here would have us believe.

347
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:20,883
But fear not.

348
00:37:21,175 --> 00:37:26,136
Everything can
and will be explained.

349
00:37:26,428 --> 00:37:30,763
All mysteries penetrated.
Hear! Hear!

350
00:37:31,055 --> 00:37:33,974
Well said ! Well said!

351
00:37:59,114 --> 00:38:01,741
Is that the emperor? Ah, yes, your father.

352
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:05,160
I didn't think
he was invited.

353
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:09,412
Bravo.

354
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:18,752
A fair likeness
of the old man.

355
00:38:19,043 --> 00:38:22,253
Too modern a style for
him, of course.

356
00:38:22,545 --> 00:38:24,421
I'm afraid I'm not much
of a painter.

357
00:38:24,713 --> 00:38:27,798
It's true. There are no
brushstrokes in this painting.

358
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:31,259
I can see that clearly.

359
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,260
So to achieve the color,

360
00:38:33,552 --> 00:38:37,179
some sort of chemical must
be interacting, presumably.

361
00:38:37,471 --> 00:38:40,139
Some sort of sprayer
up your sleeve?

362
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:43,516
- May 1?
- If you feel you must.

363
00:38:45,267 --> 00:38:48,811
- I do.
- Oh, let the man do his show.

364
00:38:49,103 --> 00:38:51,979
You want me to just sit there
when it's so obvious?

365
00:38:52,271 --> 00:38:54,357
I do.

366
00:38:54,648 --> 00:38:57,107
He tries to trick you.
I try to enlighten you.

367
00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:59,525
Which is the more
noble pursuit?

368
00:38:59,817 --> 00:39:01,527
May we have
the lights, please,

369
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:03,904
so his highness
can better see?

370
00:39:04,196 --> 00:39:07,697
See here, Leopold, let's
have the show. Hear! Hear!

371
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:10,115
Come on, Leopold.
Get on with it.

372
00:39:10,407 --> 00:39:13,076
Very well. I
propose a challenge.

373
00:39:14,826 --> 00:39:18,079
Why don't you astonish us,

374
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:20,455
if you can,

375
00:39:20,747 --> 00:39:24,916
without all the... gadgetry?

376
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:27,626
As you wish.

377
00:39:29,586 --> 00:39:31,754
Your sword is very beautiful.

378
00:39:32,046 --> 00:39:33,588
Might I see it?

379
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,714
Certainly.

380
00:39:38,424 --> 00:39:40,342
May 1?

381
00:39:46,763 --> 00:39:49,348
Where does power flow from?

382
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:55,060
Skill or destiny,
or divine right?

383
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:01,021
We all know the story
of a sword called Excalibur.

384
00:40:02,564 --> 00:40:06,191
Excalibur's blade
was fixed in stone,

385
00:40:09,902 --> 00:40:12,362
and there it stayed.

386
00:40:14,697 --> 00:40:19,074
Many worthy knights tried to
pull the sword from the stone.

387
00:40:19,366 --> 00:40:21,909
Only Arthur succeeded,

388
00:40:22,201 --> 00:40:23,952
proving his right to rule.

389
00:40:24,244 --> 00:40:26,870
Who can take this sword?

390
00:40:27,162 --> 00:40:31,164
You, sir,
can you take the sword?

391
00:40:52,261 --> 00:40:54,304
No surprise there.

392
00:40:54,595 --> 00:40:56,930
Perhaps you, sir.

393
00:40:58,932 --> 00:41:02,183
Not so eager,
cousin.

394
00:41:05,185 --> 00:41:07,186
Come on. You can do it.

395
00:41:07,478 --> 00:41:10,772
Do it! Do
it! Come on!

396
00:41:18,152 --> 00:41:21,446
You shall live along life.

397
00:41:21,738 --> 00:41:24,405
Thank you
for your indulgence.

398
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:39,956
Come now. If you can't pull it
out, you'll never be emperor.

399
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:43,459
Your father will live
to be a hundred.

400
00:41:55,466 --> 00:41:58,092
The sword
to its rightful owner!

401
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:12,101
That's enough light
entertainment for this evening.

402
00:42:12,393 --> 00:42:16,395
For more serious discussion,
please join me for a drink.

403
00:42:29,445 --> 00:42:31,237
Shut him down.

404
00:42:31,529 --> 00:42:33,697
Well, he's very popular,
your highness.

405
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:36,491
I'm sure
you'll find a way.

406
00:42:42,953 --> 00:42:47,956
What did you do to him? I
gave him what he asked for.

407
00:42:48,248 --> 00:42:50,500
What would possess you
to do something so foolish?

408
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:55,461
Duchess von teschen,
you must come along, my dear.

409
00:42:55,753 --> 00:42:58,587
We don't want to keep
the prince waiting.

410
00:42:58,879 --> 00:43:01,297
Did you enjoy the show? It
was wonderful, wasn't it?

411
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:03,965
It was amusing.

412
00:43:41,155 --> 00:43:43,657
Who told you
where to find me?

413
00:43:43,949 --> 00:43:48,284
Your manager. I told him if he wants
to stay in Vienna, you need my help.

414
00:43:48,576 --> 00:43:50,911
Ah, so I'm to be driven
from the city, is that it?

415
00:43:51,203 --> 00:43:54,205
- Good. I shall relish it.
- Stop it!

416
00:43:55,997 --> 00:43:57,998
I came here
to try to help you.

417
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:01,751
Why? Why should you possibly
care what happens to me now?

418
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:04,294
You were my friend.
I am your friend.

419
00:44:04,585 --> 00:44:09,297
We knew each other very briefly a
long time ago. You don't know me at all.

420
00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:14,300
Then why did you speak to me?
Why did you even bother talking--

421
00:45:30,346 --> 00:45:32,723
And you kept it
all this time.

422
00:45:34,515 --> 00:45:38,059
I used to sit and stare
at your picture...

423
00:45:38,351 --> 00:45:40,686
Trying to imagine
where you were.

424
00:45:42,312 --> 00:45:46,981
At night I'd have dreams
I had gone with you,

425
00:45:47,273 --> 00:45:50,859
and then I'd wake up
and realize where I was.

426
00:45:58,405 --> 00:46:02,032
But in my dreams you
had shorter hair and no beard.

427
00:46:10,537 --> 00:46:13,789
Where did you go
when you left?

428
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:18,667
To my uncle's farm
near Prague.

429
00:46:20,001 --> 00:46:21,836
How exotic.

430
00:46:25,338 --> 00:46:28,131
I went to Russia,

431
00:46:28,423 --> 00:46:30,132
then Asia minor,

432
00:46:30,424 --> 00:46:32,800
and then the orient
for many years.

433
00:46:33,092 --> 00:46:35,219
So long.

434
00:46:35,511 --> 00:46:37,845
I always meant
to return.

435
00:46:39,514 --> 00:46:44,391
I just-- I kept thinking I'd find
it around the next corner.

436
00:46:45,558 --> 00:46:47,476
What?

437
00:46:49,186 --> 00:46:51,020
A real mystery.

438
00:46:53,939 --> 00:46:55,940
I saw remarkable things,

439
00:46:56,232 --> 00:46:59,359
but the only mystery
I never solved was...

440
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:02,568
Why my heart couldn't
let go of you.

441
00:47:23,748 --> 00:47:26,166
He wants me to go
to Budapest...

442
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:28,751
With him next week
to announce our engagement.

443
00:47:31,002 --> 00:47:34,672
He wants the Hungarians
behind him.

444
00:47:34,964 --> 00:47:37,006
They're going
to crown him king.

445
00:47:37,298 --> 00:47:39,841
I'm sure his father will have
something to say about that.

446
00:47:40,133 --> 00:47:42,218
He plans to overthrow
his father.

447
00:47:43,593 --> 00:47:46,679
That could go very badly
for him...

448
00:47:46,971 --> 00:47:48,680
And for you.

449
00:47:48,972 --> 00:47:50,723
You shouldn't be involved.

450
00:47:51,014 --> 00:47:54,392
I am part of his plan.

451
00:47:54,684 --> 00:47:57,227
He only gets Hungary by
aligning himself with my family.

452
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:01,521
- Leave him.
- It's not that easy.

453
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:05,357
Call it off
and come away with me.

454
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:11,069
Or don't say anything
and we'll just go.

455
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,487
As long as we're alive,

456
00:48:14,779 --> 00:48:16,488
he'll hunt us.

457
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,782
And when he finds us,
he'll kill us.

458
00:48:32,331 --> 00:48:34,082
Look at me.

459
00:48:36,585 --> 00:48:39,794
Do you truly want
to leave with me?

460
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:47,340
Yes, I do.

461
00:49:23,738 --> 00:49:27,489
There you are. As I predicted,
they've shut us down.

462
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:31,618
Are you happy now, hmm?
You made your point.

463
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:34,494
It doesn't matter that we were
sold out for the whole run!

464
00:49:34,786 --> 00:49:38,580
No, look. You got
it off your chest.

465
00:49:38,872 --> 00:49:40,706
Do we have money?
What?

466
00:49:40,998 --> 00:49:43,625
- Do we have any money saved?
- Yes, we have some.

467
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:46,043
But we could have had
much, much more.

468
00:49:46,335 --> 00:49:49,545
Mmm, it will have to do.

469
00:49:51,338 --> 00:49:53,380
And the second account,
all of it.

470
00:49:53,672 --> 00:49:56,507
Of course, herr eisenheim.

471
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,803
Thank you.

472
00:50:56,502 --> 00:50:59,295
And you have no doubt
it was duchess von teschen?

473
00:50:59,587 --> 00:51:02,714
I'd stake my life on it.

474
00:51:03,006 --> 00:51:05,174
What was in
this suitcase?

475
00:51:05,466 --> 00:51:07,300
I don't know.

476
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,016
He's by the first car.

477
00:51:44,823 --> 00:51:47,449
The map will
show you where to meet.

478
00:51:47,741 --> 00:51:51,703
When it's done, you'll travel
ahead with her and I shall follow.

479
00:51:51,994 --> 00:51:54,454
And she understands
everything this entails?

480
00:51:54,746 --> 00:51:59,124
Completely.
There's not a lot of time.

481
00:52:29,809 --> 00:52:32,936
As you know,
we sometimes follow...

482
00:52:33,227 --> 00:52:36,229
Duchess von teschen
for her protection.

483
00:52:37,856 --> 00:52:40,566
Yesterday she was seen in
the company of another man.

484
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:42,316
What man?

485
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:46,026
Eisenheim the illusionist.

486
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:48,987
What were they doing?

487
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:53,489
Well, they were meeting
and, uh-- touching? Kissing?

488
00:52:53,781 --> 00:52:55,241
Fornicating?

489
00:52:55,533 --> 00:52:58,826
Not that we observed, no.

490
00:52:59,118 --> 00:53:02,287
However, I have reason to believe that
they may be planning something together.

491
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,914
It's possible
they may be leaving.

492
00:53:06,205 --> 00:53:08,624
I'm not certain of anything yet,
your highness.

493
00:53:08,915 --> 00:53:10,876
Thank you, inspector.

494
00:53:11,168 --> 00:53:14,210
We can, of course, acquire
more information--

495
00:53:45,521 --> 00:53:48,315
He spent the afternoon
in Vienna with his father.

496
00:53:48,607 --> 00:53:50,941
He's expected shortly.

497
00:54:22,752 --> 00:54:25,295
What a surprise.

498
00:54:25,587 --> 00:54:28,547
I thought you didn't
like it here.

499
00:54:32,383 --> 00:54:35,010
I suppose you think
you're very clever...

500
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:41,055
And very democratic
in your friendships.

501
00:54:41,347 --> 00:54:43,681
Aren't you?
What are you talking about?

502
00:54:43,973 --> 00:54:46,850
Your magician friend.

503
00:54:47,142 --> 00:54:49,268
I know you've been with him.

504
00:54:51,186 --> 00:54:54,855
It's true. We've been
friends since childhood.

505
00:54:55,147 --> 00:54:57,565
You sleep with all
your childhood friends?

506
00:54:57,857 --> 00:54:59,817
I will not be spoken
to this way.

507
00:55:00,108 --> 00:55:03,401
- You'll be spoken to as I wish to speak to you !
- You're drunk.

508
00:55:03,693 --> 00:55:06,821
You're getting quite old,
aren't you?

509
00:55:07,112 --> 00:55:10,240
You know, my mother was 16 years
old when she married my father.

510
00:55:10,532 --> 00:55:14,033
And you? Can you even bear
children? Are you any use at all?

511
00:55:14,325 --> 00:55:17,536
- Are you trying to embarrass me?
- It has nothing to do with you.

512
00:55:17,828 --> 00:55:21,162
It has everything
to do with me!

513
00:55:21,454 --> 00:55:24,581
You will not share my bed
if you've slept with him!

514
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:29,042
You don't understand.

515
00:55:29,752 --> 00:55:32,545
I'm not going to share
your bed at all.

516
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:38,632
I'm not going
to Budapest with you.

517
00:55:38,923 --> 00:55:41,842
I don't want to be part
of what you're planning.

518
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:44,134
And I will not marry you.

519
00:55:47,004 --> 00:55:51,065
I assume you haven't been so
stupid as to tell him anything.

520
00:55:51,256 --> 00:55:55,517
'Cause if you disrupt my plans, I will have
no further use for you. Do you understand?

521
00:56:02,688 --> 00:56:06,190
Now, you will travel
to Budapest tomorrow.

522
00:56:06,482 --> 00:56:10,317
I recommend that you are here
early, packed and ready to go.

523
00:56:10,609 --> 00:56:13,152
Do nothing more
to embarrass me.

524
00:56:14,486 --> 00:56:16,321
Good-bye.

525
00:56:19,739 --> 00:56:23,284
What do you mean, "good-bye"?
Come back here.

526
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:29,996
Come back here!

527
00:56:43,421 --> 00:56:46,965
Don't disobey me again.
Whore!

528
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:56,554
Out of my way.

529
00:56:56,846 --> 00:57:00,347
Please, don't.

530
00:57:26,947 --> 00:57:30,199
No, leave that.
Leave all the lanterns.

531
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:39,950
Duchess von teschen!

532
00:58:40,241 --> 00:58:42,534
Duchess von teschen!

533
00:58:51,582 --> 00:58:54,917
Maybe look on that side!

534
00:58:57,335 --> 00:59:00,003
Over here!

535
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,371
Whoa. Whoa.

536
01:00:02,458 --> 01:00:04,584
I thought you saw her
get on the train with him.

537
01:00:04,876 --> 01:00:08,753
No, sir. We were waiting in Vienna
for them, but they left from baden.

538
01:00:09,045 --> 01:00:11,171
We assumed she
was with him.

539
01:00:11,463 --> 01:00:13,297
Should I wire the
crown prince in Budapest?

540
01:00:13,589 --> 01:00:15,841
It's been done.

541
01:00:16,133 --> 01:00:18,968
- Who are you?
- I'm the family's doctor.

542
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:21,177
Are you
the chief inspector?

543
01:00:21,469 --> 01:00:25,097
Yes, I am. You understand
this is a police matter now?

544
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:28,724
- Of course I understand.
- Good, good.

545
01:00:29,016 --> 01:00:32,059
You have determined the cause
of death? She bled to death.

546
01:00:32,351 --> 01:00:35,061
There's a wound
on her throat...

547
01:00:35,353 --> 01:00:37,938
Just above
the left collarbone.

548
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:40,440
Perhaps from
a knife or a sword.

549
01:00:40,732 --> 01:00:42,816
May I take a look?

550
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:07,998
Inspector, i-I will
not stand for it.

551
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,666
The crown prince
will not stand for it.

552
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:14,085
This is not some
circus sideshow.

553
01:01:15,461 --> 01:01:18,129
My apologies, of course.

554
01:01:21,964 --> 01:01:25,008
Thank you, doctor.

555
01:01:28,761 --> 01:01:32,304
Probably robbed.
Gypsies, maybe.

556
01:01:32,596 --> 01:01:34,847
Saw all those diamonds,
couldn't say no.

557
01:01:35,139 --> 01:01:39,476
Chief inspector, there's
one thing you should know.

558
01:01:39,767 --> 01:01:42,852
Yes, what is that?
In the folds of her dress,

559
01:01:43,144 --> 01:01:46,730
I found this small gemstone.

560
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:06,617
Seen last Thursday at 7 : 30
pm., riding without an escort...

561
01:02:06,909 --> 01:02:08,618
Toward the imperial
hunting lodge.

562
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:12,287
Groomsman said she
arrived about 8 : 30.

563
01:02:12,579 --> 01:02:14,288
What was she doing
riding alone?

564
01:02:17,998 --> 01:02:20,292
He did this.
You know he did.

565
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:22,376
I know who did what?
The crown prince!

566
01:02:22,668 --> 01:02:24,669
He killed her. He's done
it before, and you know it.

567
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:27,588
No, I don't know that. In fact,
I'm sure he didn't. He's in Budapest.

568
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:31,173
- He killed her before he left!
- I'm afraid the facts don't support your theory.

569
01:02:33,841 --> 01:02:36,551
- She was leaving him.
- For who? You?

570
01:02:36,843 --> 01:02:38,928
Yes! Don't be absurd,
herr eisenheim.

571
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:42,180
He killed her because
he couldn't let her go.

572
01:02:42,472 --> 01:02:45,265
- She knew his secret.
- What secret?

573
01:02:45,557 --> 01:02:47,308
Ask your inspector. He
knows-- stop this right now!

574
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,644
Are you completely corrupt?

575
01:02:51,936 --> 01:02:55,814
No, not completely. No.

576
01:02:56,105 --> 01:03:00,900
Which is why I'll advise you not to accuse
anyone, especially his imperial highness.

577
01:03:01,191 --> 01:03:03,068
Or you will end up
in jail yourself.

578
01:03:09,947 --> 01:03:12,156
[ Hooves beating I

579
01:03:26,249 --> 01:03:29,125
Where's the guard who let her out of
the gate? Gone with the crown prince.

580
01:03:29,416 --> 01:03:31,293
Did any of the servants
see her leave? All asleep.

581
01:03:31,585 --> 01:03:34,129
Ah-ha.
What about him?

582
01:03:34,419 --> 01:03:37,130
He, uh, he put her horse in the
first stall when she arrived.

583
01:03:37,421 --> 01:03:39,256
Ah.

584
01:03:42,883 --> 01:03:45,093
Was it this one?

585
01:03:54,515 --> 01:03:57,934
We don't have jurisdiction
on imperial property.

586
01:03:58,226 --> 01:04:00,102
Thank you.
I know.

587
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:04,438
So what are you doing?

588
01:04:06,565 --> 01:04:08,941
investigating.

589
01:04:09,233 --> 01:04:11,401
Listening to that
magician, are you?

590
01:04:14,611 --> 01:04:16,988
For all we know, he did it.

591
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,364
No, I think not.

592
01:04:19,656 --> 01:04:21,907
The crown prince is back.

593
01:04:30,453 --> 01:04:32,705
Chief inspector.

594
01:04:32,997 --> 01:04:36,708
We should go. Now.

595
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,503
What have you found out?

596
01:04:42,794 --> 01:04:44,796
She was last seen
riding here, alone. Yes.

597
01:04:45,088 --> 01:04:48,339
And based on your information,
I then threw her out.

598
01:04:48,631 --> 01:04:52,134
- Did she commit suicide?
- No. It was surely murder.

599
01:04:52,426 --> 01:04:55,344
Do you have a suspect?
We will soon, your highness.

600
01:05:03,307 --> 01:05:07,310
Later that week, we
arrested a man and charged him with murder,

601
01:05:07,602 --> 01:05:11,520
but I knew that that
wouldn't satisfy eisenheim.

602
01:05:16,773 --> 01:05:19,984
I had my men continue
to watch him.

603
01:05:35,285 --> 01:05:38,995
He finally emerged from his grief
and bought a rundown theater.

604
01:05:39,287 --> 01:05:41,039
It's perfect.

605
01:05:47,459 --> 01:05:49,251
He fired his manager,

606
01:05:49,543 --> 01:05:53,171
and began preparing
for anew kind of show.

607
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:58,788
Who is he?

608
01:08:00,707 --> 01:08:02,624
My name is frankel.

609
01:08:05,042 --> 01:08:08,836
- Where did you come from?
- I come from brunn.

610
01:08:09,128 --> 01:08:10,963
My father is
a lens grinder there.

611
01:08:11,255 --> 01:08:14,047
How have you come
to be here tonight?

612
01:08:18,551 --> 01:08:21,635
- I don't know.
- Are you alive?

613
01:08:25,179 --> 01:08:27,306
What can you tell
us about the other side?

614
01:08:27,597 --> 01:08:29,348
What's it like? Yes, tell us.

615
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:32,767
You must
know things. Secret things.

616
01:08:33,059 --> 01:08:35,269
Say something spiritual.

617
01:08:56,741 --> 01:08:59,908
They don't seem
to think it's a trick.

618
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,535
Eisenheim ! Come
out and talk to us!

619
01:09:08,372 --> 01:09:11,666
Eisenheim's audience
had always been enthusiastic,

620
01:09:11,958 --> 01:09:16,669
but now he was attracting a
more... impassioned following.

621
01:09:46,103 --> 01:09:47,855
Madame. Please?

622
01:09:56,860 --> 01:10:01,404
With these spirits,
these manifestations,

623
01:10:01,696 --> 01:10:04,365
eisenheim has
given us hard proof...

624
01:10:04,656 --> 01:10:06,908
Of the soul's
immortality.

625
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,951
The spirit has been
reaffirmed...

626
01:10:10,243 --> 01:10:13,287
In the face of modern,
scientific materialism.

627
01:10:13,578 --> 01:10:16,663
The work of spiritualism
will rouse humanity...

628
01:10:16,955 --> 01:10:19,290
To anew,
moral earnestness.

629
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:23,418
"It is a revolutionary movement,
and we will turn the empire...

630
01:10:23,709 --> 01:10:26,211
Into a spiritual
republic."

631
01:10:26,503 --> 01:10:30,422
Do you think
eisenheim's behind all this?

632
01:10:36,717 --> 01:10:41,678
Why must I be bothered
with a magician?

633
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:45,473
He is proving to be more
than a magician, your highness.

634
01:10:45,765 --> 01:10:49,141
He is a charlatan.
He's a faker.

635
01:10:49,433 --> 01:10:53,395
He pretends to
have supernatural powers--

636
01:10:54,937 --> 01:10:57,271
Put him
on trial for fraud.

637
01:10:59,106 --> 01:11:01,316
First, we have to show
it is fraud. Then do it.

638
01:11:01,608 --> 01:11:03,776
Find out how the trick is
done, and then arrest him.

639
01:11:13,156 --> 01:11:15,533
This is just a rough
demonstration, inspector.

640
01:11:15,825 --> 01:11:17,659
But you can see
how it could work.

641
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:28,582
Yes, I see.
Not bad, not bad.

642
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:34,919
We need a spy
in eisenheim's troupe.

643
01:11:35,211 --> 01:11:37,587
Those orientals, they
won't give us anything. Mm.

644
01:11:37,879 --> 01:11:40,756
I already tried. Yeah.
Then try something else.

645
01:12:59,262 --> 01:13:01,097
What has happened here?

646
01:13:01,388 --> 01:13:03,432
One of those ghosts from
the theater down the street.

647
01:13:03,723 --> 01:13:05,683
Yes. Up there.
Where?

648
01:13:05,975 --> 01:13:08,767
There. Right
there. And it's a boy.

649
01:13:09,059 --> 01:13:11,603
Yes. Look, look.
Sick!

650
01:13:14,855 --> 01:13:17,231
Where is this thing?
Right there.

651
01:13:17,523 --> 01:13:19,399
Over there.
Uh-huh. Did you see it?

652
01:13:19,691 --> 01:13:21,525
Mm!

653
01:13:24,235 --> 01:13:28,572
God. An
apparition. I saw it. I swear.

654
01:13:28,864 --> 01:13:32,449
Yes! Right over there.

655
01:14:23,688 --> 01:14:25,606
Where are you taking him?

656
01:14:31,485 --> 01:14:34,362
I want to know
how it's done.

657
01:14:34,654 --> 01:14:37,113
First the orange tree,
now this.

658
01:14:37,405 --> 01:14:39,782
Do I have to share all my
professional secrets with the police?

659
01:14:40,074 --> 01:14:42,659
Well, in this case, yes, or
I'll be forced to arrest you.

660
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:44,868
On what charge? Oh,
well, we'll start with fraud.

661
01:14:47,161 --> 01:14:48,995
Excuse me, chief
inspector-- what?

662
01:14:49,287 --> 01:14:51,789
I think you should look
outside the window.

663
01:15:04,505 --> 01:15:07,590
- Who are they?
- They are here for him.

664
01:15:08,674 --> 01:15:10,883
Oh!

665
01:15:11,175 --> 01:15:14,135
My goodness, you have
a devoted following.

666
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:17,805
What is it they expect
of you? I have no idea.

667
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:20,265
What do your spies tell you?

668
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:23,475
That you plan to subvert
the monarchy, perhaps.

669
01:15:23,766 --> 01:15:27,769
Why? Just because the
crown prince is a murderer?

670
01:15:29,353 --> 01:15:32,146
He's not a murderer. We have
the real murderer in prison.

671
01:15:32,438 --> 01:15:34,523
He pleaded guilty.
You've got the wrong man.

672
01:15:34,815 --> 01:15:37,984
- You don't know that.
- No, but you do.

673
01:15:39,484 --> 01:15:41,986
Hmm.

674
01:15:44,445 --> 01:15:47,155
Herr eisenheim, you will
also go to prison...

675
01:15:47,447 --> 01:15:50,658
If you don't explain to me
what it is you are doing.

676
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:54,535
- Let him go!
- Or we will!

677
01:15:54,827 --> 01:15:58,621
The sentence will be greater
if that mob attacks the building.

678
01:15:58,913 --> 01:16:01,582
Eisenheim !
Eisenheim ! Eisenheim!

679
01:16:01,872 --> 01:16:05,333
Well?

680
01:16:07,334 --> 01:16:09,627
What are you doing?
Stop!

681
01:16:09,919 --> 01:16:11,878
- Stop!
- Eisenheim!

682
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:14,298
There he is!

683
01:16:14,589 --> 01:16:16,591
[ Eisenheim
Listen to me, please!

684
01:16:16,882 --> 01:16:20,342
You
must listen to me, please!

685
01:16:22,927 --> 01:16:27,263
Thank you all for coming. I have
been speaking with the chief inspector.

686
01:16:27,555 --> 01:16:32,058
And I think there's been
a serious misunderstanding.

687
01:16:34,226 --> 01:16:36,144
I want you all to know...

688
01:16:36,436 --> 01:16:40,271
That everything that you have
seen in my theater is an illusion.

689
01:16:40,563 --> 01:16:43,315
It's a trick.

690
01:16:43,607 --> 01:16:45,649
It's not real.

691
01:16:47,859 --> 01:16:52,528
I can't bring loved ones
back from the grave.

692
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:55,614
I can't receive messages
from the other side.

693
01:16:57,115 --> 01:16:59,825
I apologize if I've given
you any false hope.

694
01:17:00,117 --> 01:17:05,911
My intention has only been
to entertain, nothing more.

695
01:17:07,622 --> 01:17:11,749
Now
I appreciate your support.

696
01:17:12,041 --> 01:17:14,042
But you must go home.

697
01:17:14,334 --> 01:17:17,085
Please, you must go.

698
01:17:29,259 --> 01:17:32,970
There, now. I've explained
it, so it can't be fraud.

699
01:17:35,138 --> 01:17:37,056
May I go?

700
01:17:58,652 --> 01:18:00,487
Has he tricked you?
Is that it?

701
01:18:02,237 --> 01:18:04,030
No, your highness.

702
01:18:04,322 --> 01:18:06,948
Then why are you failing me?

703
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:13,119
I thought I could trust you.

704
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:19,247
I thought you were a man I could
bring with me when I took the throne.

705
01:18:21,874 --> 01:18:24,876
- Am I wrong about you?
- No. You're not wrong, your highness, no.

706
01:18:25,168 --> 01:18:30,171
I need men who can complete
the tasks assigned to them!

707
01:18:37,926 --> 01:18:40,177
Instead, I'm surrounded
by fools.

708
01:18:40,469 --> 01:18:44,180
In the end, I must
do everything myself.

709
01:18:44,471 --> 01:18:47,306
I can see this case
will be no different. Mm.

710
01:19:06,610 --> 01:19:10,904
- How do I look?
- Ordinary, your highness.

711
01:19:11,196 --> 01:19:12,988
Very ordinary.

712
01:19:17,242 --> 01:19:19,535
I think I'm going
to enjoy this.

713
01:19:40,089 --> 01:19:44,717
- They don't recognize you.
- Good.

714
01:19:45,008 --> 01:19:48,885
And keep your distance. I don't
want to be seen with a policeman.

715
01:21:08,517 --> 01:21:11,269
Who are you?

716
01:21:11,561 --> 01:21:13,896
Are you duchess von teschen?

717
01:21:14,188 --> 01:21:15,938
Yes.

718
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:18,064
What's happened to you?

719
01:21:18,356 --> 01:21:20,941
She was murdered.
Were you murdered?

720
01:21:23,902 --> 01:21:26,403
By who?

721
01:21:26,695 --> 01:21:28,404
Did they arrest the right man?

722
01:21:28,696 --> 01:21:31,615
Tell us, please.
Who murdered you?

723
01:21:31,907 --> 01:21:34,617
Tell us.
Someone. Here.

724
01:21:34,908 --> 01:21:37,451
Tell us, and point him out.

725
01:21:37,743 --> 01:21:39,495
Was it the crown prince?

726
01:21:39,787 --> 01:21:41,829
He's killed a woman before!

727
01:21:42,121 --> 01:21:44,039
Hey! The crown
prince isn't even here.

728
01:21:44,331 --> 01:21:47,540
The crown prince killed
her! Something must be done!

729
01:22:14,474 --> 01:22:16,475
Chief inspector, are you
sure you have the right man?

730
01:22:16,767 --> 01:22:19,435
Quite sure. Excuse me. Did you
investigate the crown prince?

731
01:22:19,727 --> 01:22:21,478
He cannot continue
if this is true.

732
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,479
He must be brought
to justice. It's not true.

733
01:22:23,771 --> 01:22:26,231
The magic trick is not
evidence. What is your name?

734
01:22:26,523 --> 01:22:29,942
I don't see how that matters. I
advise you to watch what you say, sir.

735
01:22:36,487 --> 01:22:39,531
That actress didn't even
look like Sophie.

736
01:22:39,823 --> 01:22:41,782
But the audience is
stupid and he knows it.

737
01:22:42,074 --> 01:22:46,034
He manipulates them.
He himself said nothing.

738
01:22:46,326 --> 01:22:48,036
His actress said nothing
inflammatory.

739
01:22:48,328 --> 01:22:50,371
He left it to the audience
to make their accusations.

740
01:22:50,663 --> 01:22:52,914
All plants paid for
by him, of course.

741
01:22:54,790 --> 01:22:56,791
I don't suppose you made
a note of those people??

742
01:22:57,083 --> 01:22:59,084
I'm afraid we didn't
have enough men tonight.

743
01:22:59,376 --> 01:23:02,253
At the next performance,
I want them all arrested.

744
01:23:02,545 --> 01:23:05,713
Every one of them.
Eisenheim, the whole troupe.

745
01:23:06,005 --> 01:23:09,006
I want to have an example
made of him...

746
01:23:09,298 --> 01:23:11,800
In front of
all his followers.

747
01:23:15,344 --> 01:23:17,595
That was very foolish
last night.

748
01:23:21,848 --> 01:23:24,182
You can't destroy him,
you know.

749
01:23:24,474 --> 01:23:27,434
You can't bring down the
monarchy. Oh, know I can't.

750
01:23:27,726 --> 01:23:29,769
Then don't
raise her again.

751
01:23:30,061 --> 01:23:32,312
Don't provoke
those questions.

752
01:23:37,107 --> 01:23:39,692
Eisenheim, I don't
want to arrest you.

753
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:44,570
I'm a cynical man,
god knows,

754
01:23:44,862 --> 01:23:47,613
but if your manifestations
are somehow real,

755
01:23:47,905 --> 01:23:50,740
then even I'm willing to admit,
you're Avery special person.

756
01:23:51,032 --> 01:23:53,742
And if it's a trick,
then it's equally impressive.

757
01:23:54,034 --> 01:23:56,327
Either way,
you have a gift.

758
01:23:56,619 --> 01:23:59,787
So don't make me
put you in jail!

759
01:24:00,079 --> 01:24:02,081
Promise me you won't
do it again.

760
01:24:02,372 --> 01:24:05,499
I promise you, you'll
enjoy this next show.

761
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:09,419
What do you want?

762
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:13,921
- Nothing.
- Then why bring her back?

763
01:24:16,006 --> 01:24:17,923
Just to be with her.

764
01:24:20,758 --> 01:24:22,593
To be with her.

765
01:24:32,516 --> 01:24:34,309
Everything is ready?
Yes, sir.

766
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:37,561
- We're trying to assess how he might escape.
- He will not escape.

767
01:24:37,852 --> 01:24:40,271
I want guards at every
door and window! Sir.

768
01:24:48,066 --> 01:24:50,526
I want to apologize to you
for my behavior of late.

769
01:24:50,818 --> 01:24:53,612
But I want to make it up to you,
if you'll listen to a proposition.

770
01:24:53,904 --> 01:24:56,947
Well, I don't know. I'll make
it worth your while, Josef.

771
01:24:57,239 --> 01:25:00,325
You know, I'm very busy right now. I haven't
just been sitting around waiting for you.

772
01:25:00,617 --> 01:25:02,451
No. No, of course.

773
01:25:06,953 --> 01:25:10,372
I want you to assume control
of all my finances.

774
01:25:10,664 --> 01:25:12,874
And my assets.

775
01:25:13,166 --> 01:25:15,542
Everything.
Everything?

776
01:25:15,834 --> 01:25:18,793
Yes. Including
this theater,

777
01:25:19,085 --> 01:25:20,795
and all the receipts from
tonight's performance,

778
01:25:21,086 --> 01:25:23,880
which I offer with
my sincere thanks.

779
01:25:27,466 --> 01:25:31,676
What do you say?
All right.

780
01:25:31,968 --> 01:25:34,845
I'll do it.
Good. Good.

781
01:25:36,096 --> 01:25:39,097
Would you like me
to introduce you tonight?

782
01:25:39,389 --> 01:25:42,058
No. Tonight, just
enjoy the show.

783
01:26:04,655 --> 01:26:07,782
Excuse me, chief inspector. I'm
Josef fischer, eisenheim's manager.

784
01:26:08,074 --> 01:26:10,241
Yes, I remember.

785
01:26:10,533 --> 01:26:13,160
What's going on? Why all the
police? Precautions, herr fischer.

786
01:26:13,452 --> 01:26:15,954
Precautions. Are you
planning to arrest eisenheim?

787
01:26:16,245 --> 01:26:18,997
Oh, that's
entirely up to him.

788
01:26:57,812 --> 01:27:00,730
[ Woman
I There! There!

789
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:04,817
It's duchess von teschen!

790
01:27:17,449 --> 01:27:20,617
Why were you murdered?

791
01:27:20,909 --> 01:27:23,244
I was leaving him. Leaving who?

792
01:27:23,536 --> 01:27:26,162
- The crown prince?
- Of course it was.

793
01:27:26,454 --> 01:27:29,123
We won't stand
for it! I tried to get away.

794
01:27:34,042 --> 01:27:35,960
I was wearing my locket
when I died.

795
01:27:36,252 --> 01:27:39,129
But now it's gone.
It's lost.

796
01:27:39,421 --> 01:27:42,047
- Tell us, please. Who murdered you?
- Was it the crown prince?

797
01:27:42,339 --> 01:27:44,590
We must do something!

798
01:27:44,882 --> 01:27:47,134
Come along.
We must help her!

799
01:27:52,804 --> 01:27:54,722
To the front!

800
01:27:56,139 --> 01:27:58,307
Step out!

801
01:28:01,559 --> 01:28:04,227
In the name of
his imperial majesty,

802
01:28:04,519 --> 01:28:09,605
and the city of Vienna, I hereby
arrest eduard abramovicz--

803
01:28:09,897 --> 01:28:12,566
Also known as
eisenheim the illusionist--

804
01:28:12,858 --> 01:28:16,027
On charges of disturbing
public order,

805
01:28:16,318 --> 01:28:19,361
charlatanism and threats
against the empire!

806
01:28:19,653 --> 01:28:22,238
- No!
- Get back, get back!

807
01:28:26,158 --> 01:28:29,325
Stop it! Stop
it, all of you !

808
01:29:25,276 --> 01:29:27,236
- He disappeared.
- Where is he?

809
01:29:30,821 --> 01:29:32,947
Find him!

810
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,538
Where is he?
He was right there.

811
01:29:45,830 --> 01:29:47,791
How was his trick done?
No trick.

812
01:29:48,082 --> 01:29:50,375
How is it done? I don't
know. Nobody know.

813
01:29:58,254 --> 01:30:00,548
Damn it!

814
01:33:45,851 --> 01:33:49,479
I had my driver take
the sword to police headquarters.

815
01:33:52,146 --> 01:33:55,190
My men will examine it and
see if it matches the gemstone...

816
01:33:55,482 --> 01:33:58,317
Found on duchess von teschen's
body-- I have no doubt that it will.

817
01:34:02,527 --> 01:34:05,947
And after that,
I came in here...

818
01:34:06,239 --> 01:34:09,241
And you asked me
why I was late.

819
01:34:10,366 --> 01:34:12,243
You've stolen
imperial property.

820
01:34:12,533 --> 01:34:14,535
That seems trivial
compared with murder.

821
01:34:14,827 --> 01:34:17,037
Even if that were true, you
have no jurisdiction here.

822
01:34:17,329 --> 01:34:21,581
That's right. You may do as you
wish here, without consequence.

823
01:34:22,873 --> 01:34:26,459
Nobody can punish you.

824
01:34:26,751 --> 01:34:28,627
- Except one man.
- Who's that?

825
01:34:28,919 --> 01:34:31,587
The emperor.

826
01:34:31,879 --> 01:34:34,673
I don't suppose he'll leave his
crown to a murderer, do you?

827
01:34:37,882 --> 01:34:41,176
- He'll never believe you.
- Maybe not.

828
01:34:42,552 --> 01:34:45,221
Hmm.

829
01:34:45,512 --> 01:34:47,430
But, I wrote a letter
to his general staff,

830
01:34:47,722 --> 01:34:50,807
telling them... everything.

831
01:34:51,099 --> 01:34:54,184
Including your plan
to overthrow the emperor.

832
01:34:54,476 --> 01:34:57,478
I know they'll listen to that.

833
01:34:57,770 --> 01:35:00,146
You'll not take the throne--
not with my help.

834
01:35:00,438 --> 01:35:04,691
You no longer want to be
chief of police? Mayor of Vienna?

835
01:35:04,983 --> 01:35:08,442
You don't want to be
a baron, an aristocrat?

836
01:35:09,819 --> 01:35:12,529
I'm afraid that's out of
the question at this point.

837
01:35:18,074 --> 01:35:19,866
You fool.
He's tricking you.

838
01:35:20,158 --> 01:35:23,411
He's manipulating you. He had the
sword at a command performance.

839
01:35:23,702 --> 01:35:25,996
He could have pried the stones
loose then and planted them here.

840
01:35:26,287 --> 01:35:27,997
He has planted everything.
You're drunk.

841
01:35:28,289 --> 01:35:32,791
It's all a trick.
It's an illusion.

842
01:35:34,333 --> 01:35:37,544
Perhaps there's truth
in this illusion.

843
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:52,886
You need to wire your driver,
and have the sword returned.

844
01:35:53,178 --> 01:35:56,763
- Or what?
- I'll shoot you. Perhaps I'll shoot you anyway.

845
01:35:57,055 --> 01:36:00,349
And then you'll have killed a
police inspector and a duchess.

846
01:36:00,641 --> 01:36:02,350
Or perhaps
you'll kill yourself.

847
01:36:02,642 --> 01:36:06,145
You, uh, committed suicide,
distraught at having failed your leader.

848
01:36:22,362 --> 01:36:27,741
Ah. Some officers of the
general staff, I'd guess.

849
01:36:28,033 --> 01:36:29,867
They must have
received my letter.

850
01:36:39,206 --> 01:36:42,875
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything.

851
01:36:43,167 --> 01:36:47,711
Fine. Fine. You
shall have nothing.

852
01:36:55,966 --> 01:36:59,761
- Gentlemen--
- the situation is so obvious.

853
01:37:00,053 --> 01:37:02,803
Everyone's completely
incompetent.

854
01:37:03,095 --> 01:37:05,305
My father runs the empire
into the ground,

855
01:37:05,597 --> 01:37:07,432
and no one notices, no one
knows anything about it.

856
01:37:07,724 --> 01:37:09,808
I propose to clean up
the mess, and you betray me!

857
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:12,560
You're all becoming
irrelevant. You will be replaced.

858
01:37:12,852 --> 01:37:16,937
The country
will be run by mongrels!

859
01:37:17,229 --> 01:37:20,981
There's a thousand different voices screaming
to be heard, and nothing will be done!

860
01:37:21,273 --> 01:37:24,984
Nothing !
I've done everything I can.

861
01:37:25,276 --> 01:37:28,111
Too much !

862
01:37:30,404 --> 01:37:32,280
Far too much.

863
01:37:32,572 --> 01:37:35,574
Your highness!
Are you in there?

864
01:37:35,865 --> 01:37:38,201
Your highness, open the door.

865
01:37:38,492 --> 01:37:40,285
Please.
Open the door.

866
01:37:40,577 --> 01:37:43,204
By your
father's authority,

867
01:37:43,495 --> 01:37:46,288
I insist you open the door!

868
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:48,499
You must open the door!

869
01:37:48,790 --> 01:37:51,208
You're all fools.

870
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:54,585
- Please, your highness!
- I can't stand it.

871
01:37:54,877 --> 01:37:58,588
Won't stand it.

872
01:37:58,879 --> 01:38:01,131
Break
down the door. Break it down!

873
01:38:06,176 --> 01:38:09,886
What happened? The crown
prince just shot himself.

874
01:38:55,956 --> 01:38:58,165
Are you chief inspector uhl?

875
01:38:58,457 --> 01:39:00,708
I used to be.

876
01:39:25,390 --> 01:39:28,684
You !
Who gave you this?

877
01:39:30,977 --> 01:39:33,645
Who gave you this?
Herr eisenheim!

878
01:39:34,813 --> 01:39:36,730
When?

879
01:39:58,577 --> 01:40:00,620
Look out!

880
01:41:04,450 --> 01:41:06,160
All aboard !

881
01:41:06,452 --> 01:41:08,828
Tickets and papers.

882
01:41:11,330 --> 01:41:14,373
All aboard!

883
01:41:42,723 --> 01:41:44,517
When it's done,

884
01:41:44,808 --> 01:41:46,935
you'll travel ahead
with her, and I will follow.

885
01:41:47,227 --> 01:41:50,394
- And she understands everything this entails?
- Completely.

886
01:41:50,686 --> 01:41:52,979
Do you think that
eisenheim's behind all this?

887
01:41:56,607 --> 01:42:00,526
So, what
does it mean, to die?

888
01:42:03,069 --> 01:42:06,863
- What do you want?
- To be with her.

889
01:42:07,155 --> 01:42:10,032
To be with her.

890
01:42:12,825 --> 01:42:17,745
Chief inspector, there's
one thing you should know.

891
01:42:21,038 --> 01:42:23,540
Your sword is
very beautiful. Might I see it?

892
01:42:23,831 --> 01:42:26,124
- You're drunk.
- You were drunk.

893
01:42:40,717 --> 01:42:42,885
He's a
charlatan. He's a faker.

894
01:42:43,177 --> 01:42:45,595
He's planted everything.

895
01:42:56,726 --> 01:42:59,186
Everything
you have seen is an illusion.

896
01:42:59,478 --> 01:43:01,604
It's a trick.
