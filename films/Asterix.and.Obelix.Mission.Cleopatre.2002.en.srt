1
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:52,833
An Old Egyptian poem goes as follows: "Nile,

2
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:57,750
Nile, Nile, impetuous and turbulent river

3
00:00:57,842 --> 00:01:01,625
you're like our queen, the source of life.

4
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:05,667
Our story begins in a distant past, in Alexandria,

5
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,500
or at Alexandria, both are possible...

6
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,917
in Egypt, at the palace of the queen of queens.

7
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:16,375
The legendary and elegant Cleopatra.

8
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:17,625
Enough!

9
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,250
I'm saying Egypt's culture isn't all that great...

10
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:28,792
There were good times of course.

11
00:02:28,842 --> 00:02:31,750
I'm just saying the current people are decadent.

12
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:35,167
And that Egypt is merely a Roman province.

13
00:02:35,217 --> 00:02:38,000
- A "province"! - Yes...

14
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:41,500
Until further notice, O Caesar...

15
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,417
it's not the Romans that build the great pyramids.

16
00:02:45,842 --> 00:02:48,542
- Those pointy things? - And the sphinx?

17
00:02:48,758 --> 00:02:51,625
And the tower of Pharos? What do you think of that?

18
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:54,417
- That's old news. - Yesterday...

19
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:58,833
- or today, my people are superior. - In fact your people are...

20
00:02:58,883 --> 00:03:02,375
Greek, and I know better true Egyptians.

21
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:03,875
Enough!

22
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,708
I can prove to you, O Caesar...

23
00:03:09,758 --> 00:03:12,958
that my people are still brilliant.

24
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:15,917
Yes? How? Painting portraits?

25
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,750
No, by building a palace.

26
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:21,917
I already have a palace in Rome.

27
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:26,583
You'll get one in Alexandria too. So when you visit the "province"...

28
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:31,500
you'll have somewhere to sleep. But it will be bigger...

29
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,208
and more luxurious than all other palaces.

30
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,875
Bigger than "Caesar's Palace"? I'd like to see that...

31
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:41,417
You will see.

32
00:03:42,175 --> 00:03:45,750
Rome wasn't built in one day. When will it be finished?

33
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:47,667
Three centuries from now?

34
00:03:47,883 --> 00:03:49,042
Three months.

35
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,042
- Three months? - Three months?

36
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:54,542
- Three... - Months?

37
00:03:54,842 --> 00:03:57,625
Within 3 months you'll have your palace.

38
00:03:57,675 --> 00:04:00,375
It'll never be finished in time.

39
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:03,167
But fine, I accept the challenge.

40
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:05,958
If you make it, I'll publicly admit...

41
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:10,458
that your people is still brilliant. But I have my doubts.

42
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,625
See you in three months...

43
00:04:20,842 --> 00:04:23,375
He really gets the most of me.

44
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh no... why is the floor already finished?

45
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,375
First the water pipes. Now we have to break up the floor.

46
00:04:42,425 --> 00:04:47,042
Malococsis, I'm not an architect. I'm a tiler.

47
00:04:47,092 --> 00:04:50,000
- What's that door doing there? - No idea.

48
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,958
- Ask Noumerobis, the architect. - Architects...

49
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:57,458
Along with cart wrights they're the most incompetent.

50
00:04:57,508 --> 00:04:59,208
Malococsis!

51
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:02,583
- Noumerobis... - I'm happy to see you.

52
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,542
- How are you? - Terrible!

53
00:05:05,842 --> 00:05:07,667
W... w... What's the problem?

54
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:10,125
- The door in the ceiling? - That?

55
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:15,083
I anticipate. Should you want a second floor, no problem.

56
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:18,708
And the tiles. Beautiful, huh? Feudartifis, come see.

57
00:05:19,217 --> 00:05:22,292
- Are they beautiful or what? - Beautiful.

58
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,458
Malococsis... trust me...

59
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:31,875
- I'm not a cart wright. - You're worse.

60
00:05:32,383 --> 00:05:36,208
You're running two months behind. Watch it, I have connections.

61
00:05:36,258 --> 00:05:39,458
People in high places who could cause you a great deal of problems.

62
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:42,625
Preferably from Alexandria...

63
00:05:44,008 --> 00:05:45,750
Architect Noumerobis?

64
00:05:47,717 --> 00:05:50,417
No, that's... What's it about?

65
00:05:50,592 --> 00:05:53,333
I had to laugh because of the Alexandria joke...

66
00:05:53,383 --> 00:05:58,167
because people in high places makes me think about monkeys in a tree...

67
00:05:58,217 --> 00:06:00,542
You don't have to get angry.

68
00:06:03,717 --> 00:06:06,667
My little one... Wake up. Breakfast.

69
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:12,958
Kinepolis... What's that?

70
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,300
Lovendpis...

71
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:20,375
Serge...

72
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:28,458
Artifis... clean the water. It stinks.

73
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:32,208
I don't smell anything...

74
00:06:32,383 --> 00:06:35,500
I was just doing what I always do.

75
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:38,542
That's your problem.

76
00:06:38,675 --> 00:06:40,333
You always do like you always do.

77
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,583
Yes, I always do.

78
00:06:43,258 --> 00:06:47,042
The floor is weird. I don't feel it.

79
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:48,792
Where is it?

80
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,625
Good day.

81
00:06:55,258 --> 00:06:59,167
Noumerobis, is Egypt the most powerful empire in the world?

82
00:06:59,342 --> 00:07:02,958
Yes. No one in the world has more power.

83
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:06,750
Of course I don't know everyone.

84
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:10,375
The Romans and Caesar have their doubts.

85
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,375
- I'm going to show him what we can do. - OK.

86
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,501
I'm building him the most magnificent palace.

87
00:07:17,513 --> 00:07:18,513
OK.

88
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:21,458
And you, Noumerobis, will be the architect.

89
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:23,333
OK.

90
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:26,042
I'll be the architect. Meaning?

91
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:28,583
I'll have to...

92
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,542
Al my other architects are busy.

93
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:35,375
No, I'm not busy.

94
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,417
He's not busy.

95
00:07:40,758 --> 00:07:43,542
Noumerobis, you're the only one available.

96
00:07:44,758 --> 00:07:48,625
I have no time. I have to finish my work for Malococsis.

97
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,917
Only the tiles, but anyway...

98
00:07:51,092 --> 00:07:54,833
My Queen, as your architect I offer you my services.

99
00:07:56,383 --> 00:07:58,750
When the crocodiles have fresh water, I could...

100
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,875
No, you're good, but too conservative.

101
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:05,417
Conservative... What does that mean?

102
00:08:05,592 --> 00:08:08,750
I want something new, something refreshing.

103
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:13,125
But... help Noumerobis. Find some land.

104
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,125
Land?

105
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:17,042
As you wish.

106
00:08:17,217 --> 00:08:21,333
Go, Noumerobis, you've got three months.

107
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,458
Three months? What margin?

108
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:30,083
Because three months, that's merely enough for the plans...

109
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:33,875
and with the foundations, that's three times four, nine...

110
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:38,208
Three months, that's... I don't think that's enough.

111
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:43,083
Noumerobis! You've got three months. Exactly!

112
00:08:55,258 --> 00:08:57,917
If you succeed, I'll cover you with gold.

113
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:02,958
If you fail, I'll feed you to the crocodiles.

114
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,958
Where's the sweet little lamb?

115
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,500
They ate the little lamb?

116
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:45,625
I should build that palace.

117
00:09:45,675 --> 00:09:48,208
Then I, neither Cleopatra, the rain...

118
00:09:48,258 --> 00:09:50,208
the hail nor the locusts...

119
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:55,458
would be Egypt's worst nightmare.

120
00:09:58,592 --> 00:10:02,417
17, 18, 19, 20, 21...

121
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,125
- 474, 475, 476, 477... - Boss!

122
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:23,250
Boss! I rushed myself...

123
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,042
I was thinking about some sort of machine...

124
00:10:26,217 --> 00:10:29,333
that would enable us to reach the top of the pyramid.

125
00:10:29,383 --> 00:10:33,167
Otis... can't this wait?

126
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:37,875
- What are you counting, boss? - I'm measuring.

127
00:10:40,717 --> 00:10:43,333
Cleopatra wants a palace for Caesar.

128
00:10:43,383 --> 00:10:46,042
Here. On this stroke of land.

129
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:49,833
From there... to there.

130
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,042
That would be a big palace.

131
00:10:53,092 --> 00:10:55,208
It has to be modern and daring.

132
00:10:55,383 --> 00:10:58,542
That's great. You can stop now...

133
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:00,500
leave it to the experts.

134
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,042
No time, we've got 3 months.

135
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:05,250
Fine. And how much extra time?

136
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,667
None. We've got 3 months, not a day more.

137
00:11:09,258 --> 00:11:12,125
- Impossible. - That's obvious.

138
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:14,583
However urgent jobs can be interesting.

139
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,750
It's not urgent, it's suicide.

140
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,542
If I fail, I'll be fed to the crocodiles. And I saw them...

141
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:22,958
A crocodile is fast.

142
00:11:23,008 --> 00:11:25,875
Not good. I can't finish my machine.

143
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:29,708
Did you hear me did you hear me?

144
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:33,917
- Yes, no, but... - Sorry, but I can be eaten.

145
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:35,708
Three months starting when?

146
00:11:38,842 --> 00:11:39,616
The clock is ticking.

147
00:11:39,628 --> 00:11:41,500
They've been working on the gardens for years.

148
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,792
And there's nothing. Completely nothing.

149
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:46,500
We need magic.

150
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:50,875
We need to be magicians. Gods.

151
00:11:52,383 --> 00:11:56,000
Exactly... We need magical powers.

152
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:59,125
Yes, it's not good news, but that's it.

153
00:12:03,425 --> 00:12:05,375
When I was little...

154
00:12:05,883 --> 00:12:10,250
my dad told me about this druid. Pano-Panobemix.

155
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:14,083
Panasonix...

156
00:12:15,258 --> 00:12:16,958
Something ending in ix?

157
00:12:17,508 --> 00:12:19,375
Matoucasolix?

158
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,083
It starts with Pano... and ends in ininekix.

159
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:24,583
How about Pommederainettepommedapix.

160
00:12:25,717 --> 00:12:27,542
A druid.

161
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:30,833
A Gallic druid with a magic potion.

162
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,000
It gives people enormous strength.

163
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:37,458
Using that potion I'll finish in no time and stay alive.

164
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:41,458
Imhotep, I didn't expect it, but suddenly I'm freed.

165
00:12:41,508 --> 00:12:45,000
Boss... magic potions don't exist.

166
00:12:45,175 --> 00:12:49,167
Only on children's papyrus drawings.

167
00:12:49,592 --> 00:12:52,125
Get us some workers. Let them start the foundations.

168
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:56,583
There will be a lane with big statues. Called "Big Statue Lane".

169
00:12:56,633 --> 00:13:01,083
And there gardens with olive and orange trees, willows...

170
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:04,333
Yes, and there the palace, luxurious and magnificent.

171
00:13:04,508 --> 00:13:08,292
With a huge court yard and lots of dancers.

172
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:13,500
And there a small geranium, yes, that will be beautiful.

173
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,625
That will be really beautiful.

174
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:18,333
- You have to picture it. - Yes.

175
00:13:18,508 --> 00:13:22,292
- I'm leaving. See you in a month. - A month?

176
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:25,625
Max. The time to find Panobemix and come back.

177
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,583
Go, Cannabis.

178
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:30,542
Go, Cannabis!

179
00:13:30,842 --> 00:13:32,792
Let's go!

180
00:13:35,092 --> 00:13:37,875
You're not moving, Cannabis.

181
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,750
Move it! Go, Cannabis!

182
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,333
Where does that Mix live?

183
00:13:41,383 --> 00:13:45,417
Up north. He lives up north.

184
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:49,417
Go, go Cannabis.

185
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:57,083
The year is 50 B.C.

186
00:13:57,133 --> 00:14:01,875
Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans. Well, not entirely...

187
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:07,443
One small village of invincible Gauls still holds out against the invaders.

188
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:10,187
And life is not easy for the Roman legionaries

189
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:12,292
who garrison the fortified camps of

190
00:14:12,342 --> 00:14:17,000
Babaorum, Aquarium, Laudanum and Petibonum...

191
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,542
En garde, Gaul. Defend yourself!

192
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:22,333
One moment please.

193
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:29,375
- What was that? - Are you new here?

194
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,292
Yes, we've just been transferred.

195
00:14:31,467 --> 00:14:36,167
I understand. This potion is a magic potion...

196
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:40,708
made by our druid and it makes us stronger.

197
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:46,500
Look.

198
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:54,292
Panomanix! Panomenixme!

199
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:57,250
What kind of country is this?

200
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:02,125
Incredible, it's minus 8000 degrees here.

201
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:14,583
I don't have to drink it, I fell in when I was a little boy.

202
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:18,125
It gives me extraordinary power.

203
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:19,917
Look.

204
00:15:23,717 --> 00:15:25,750
Nice, huh?

205
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,042
Good day. Where's the Gallic village.

206
00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:34,833
If you follow them you'll get there

207
00:15:35,008 --> 00:15:38,792
I'm not going with you, OK? I'm staying here.

208
00:15:38,842 --> 00:15:40,917
I'm going to think a little.

209
00:15:42,258 --> 00:15:46,125
Those Romans are good, they fly better than the others.

210
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:49,958
It's because of their new helmets. They're more aerodynamic.

211
00:15:51,425 --> 00:15:53,375
Listen...

212
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:57,292
Landing could be better.

213
00:15:58,008 --> 00:16:00,859
Excuse me? Are you Asterixme?

214
00:16:00,883 --> 00:16:04,125
Rix. Asterix. And this is Obelix.

215
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:06,708
And the dog is Idefix.

216
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:11,708
Do you know Panobamenix? A druid.

217
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:23,042
Panoramix, excuse me for disturbing, but you have a visitor.

218
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,125
- Sir? - It's me!

219
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:32,208
He obviously doesn't know you.

220
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:36,333
I, I, I'm Noumerobis. I'm Tumeris' son, your old friend.

221
00:16:37,758 --> 00:16:41,125
What a pleasant surprise.

222
00:16:41,758 --> 00:16:43,958
You must be frozen.

223
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,292
I'm very happy to see you.

224
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:50,625
He's from Alexandria. Come warm yourself.

225
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:56,458
- That's the magic potion? - No, chestnut soup.

226
00:17:01,883 --> 00:17:03,250
No.

227
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:06,792
I can't sell you any potion.

228
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,208
Not all of it. One cauldron.

229
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:14,675
No.

230
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,792
He won't budge, it's the principle.

231
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:20,333
A small cauldron.

232
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:21,917
No.

233
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,833
- A flask. - No.

234
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:30,833
- A small flask. - Nee.

235
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:35,292
A cup. A small cup. A small cup, that's all.

236
00:17:36,383 --> 00:17:40,875
It's a secret among druids and not for sale.

237
00:17:44,592 --> 00:17:46,667
A little cup is not much.

238
00:17:47,383 --> 00:17:48,958
I'm sorry, Noumerobis.

239
00:17:54,467 --> 00:17:56,417
OK then.

240
00:17:57,967 --> 00:18:00,333
You were my only hope.

241
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:04,250
The small chance of survival.

242
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:06,958
But I understand.

243
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:09,322
You have other things to worry about.

244
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,125
Caesar, the Romans. Who I'm not fond of.

245
00:18:15,758 --> 00:18:19,708
Maybe I'm going to die... But it was nice knowing you.

246
00:18:20,675 --> 00:18:22,000
Gentlemen...

247
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:23,967
Midifix...

248
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:32,042
But what's wrong?

249
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:38,917
Noumerobis, wait. I've been planning to consult some manuscripts...

250
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:41,458
in Alexandria's library. I can't promise anything...

251
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:45,000
but I'll join you.

252
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,583
Thanks. Thanks a lot, Panomanix.

253
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:52,625
My ship is waiting, there's enough room for everyone.

254
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:55,609
- There's no time to loose. - Let's go, Idefix.

255
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:58,875
- You're not going to take him are you? - Why not?

256
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:03,417
He's too small for such a big trip. And Egypt is the land of cats.

257
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:06,917
Pack your bags and don't talk about any longer.

258
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:11,667
"Don't talk about it..."

259
00:19:21,675 --> 00:19:25,583
Accompanied by the arctic wind, on board of the Napadelis...

260
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:30,000
a long journey to Egypt begins, the land of Ra, the Sun God.

261
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,708
Cleopatra's kingdom would soon welcome...

262
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:38,833
Asterix, Obelix and Panoramix And Idefix?

263
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:41,042
What?

264
00:19:42,217 --> 00:19:46,208
I bark. I'm not allowed to talk any more, so I bark.

265
00:19:46,383 --> 00:19:49,625
Fine. Take him out, before he suffocates.

266
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:53,375
- But it's empty. - "It's empty".

267
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:59,333
Such a smart dog. My baby.

268
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:02,083
How nice. He wanted to be with me.

269
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:04,583
- He got in there himself. - We were just saying...

270
00:20:04,758 --> 00:20:07,083
three months is a little short.

271
00:20:07,258 --> 00:20:09,167
Artifis is a real hyena.

272
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:12,500
Do you know hyenas? Just the same.

273
00:20:12,675 --> 00:20:14,315
He wants me dead and he has many talents.

274
00:20:14,383 --> 00:20:17,167
- Like what? - No, he's rich.

275
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:20,500
He's got many golden talents. The Egyptian coin.

276
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,417
In Gaul not the ones with most talents are the richest.

277
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:27,458
- Do we have to fear anything else? - No, nothing.

278
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:29,708
Red Beard! Red Beard!

279
00:20:45,217 --> 00:20:49,583
Men, last time we weren't very lucky meeting those Gauls...

280
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:53,583
with their magic potion, and that big dog.

281
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:59,292
Completely outnumbered we had no other option than to...

282
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,467
Run away.

283
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,458
No, not really.

284
00:21:03,508 --> 00:21:06,375
We had to abandon ship as soon as possible.

285
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,083
- Swimming in that ice-cold water. - No, it was nice.

286
00:21:09,258 --> 00:21:11,375
- It was ice cold. - Fine.

287
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:17,000
To prevent further trouble, we'll avoid the Gauls.

288
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,083
But for any others, no pity!

289
00:21:26,383 --> 00:21:29,542
Ship at starboard!

290
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:35,958
Ready to board, daddy. Raise the oars.

291
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:37,875
Calm down, my girl.

292
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,083
Besides you're not making any sense.

293
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,708
That's what I thought.

294
00:21:42,883 --> 00:21:45,500
How many ships, Boy?

295
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,917
Just one, Captain, a small one.

296
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:51,542
Egyptian, Captain.

297
00:21:51,717 --> 00:21:55,458
- Egyptian. - Egyptian. Sounds good.

298
00:21:55,508 --> 00:22:00,042
- This will get us back on track. - "Ipso facto et manu militari".

299
00:22:00,217 --> 00:22:01,217
Triplepod.

300
00:22:02,383 --> 00:22:06,792
Man your posts. Bosco, Gambler, Mullet, hoist the sails!

301
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:10,167
Rackham, Worley, Husk, blow the horns.

302
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:14,500
Get ready to board.

303
00:22:23,758 --> 00:22:27,125
I'm king of the world!

304
00:22:29,217 --> 00:22:30,833
Pirates!

305
00:22:34,383 --> 00:22:36,917
Help, pirates!

306
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:43,000
Look, pirates. Quick, we have to have to get out of here.

307
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:45,667
The pirates.

308
00:22:49,842 --> 00:22:51,208
It's us!

309
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:59,125
The G... The Ga... The Gau... The Gauls!

310
00:23:00,175 --> 00:23:01,458
This can't be happening.

311
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:08,583
Is there an axe here? Watch out. Pardon me.

312
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:15,417
- Calm down there. - What are they doing?

313
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,542
- Cheater! - It's not fair.

314
00:23:34,592 --> 00:23:37,042
Good. Sink it yourselves.

315
00:23:37,092 --> 00:23:38,875
They know who we are.

316
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:43,375
They're old friends. We've met them many times at sea before.

317
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:50,125
You see, "Abyssus abyssum invocat."

318
00:23:52,675 --> 00:23:56,917
Enough of those Latin proverbs.

319
00:24:05,592 --> 00:24:08,208
What's that at the horizon?

320
00:24:08,258 --> 00:24:09,833
The lights of Alexandria.

321
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:12,625
Let the butterflies of my youth strand.

322
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:16,208
I don't know why I just said that.

323
00:24:16,383 --> 00:24:18,875
- I'm hungry. - We'll be there in the morning.

324
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:22,917
That's the tower of Pharos, a beacon for ships.

325
00:24:23,092 --> 00:24:26,833
A beacon for ships. Egyptians are mad.

326
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:32,000
It's one of the seven wonders of the world. The biggest construction ever made by man.

327
00:24:32,175 --> 00:24:34,042
I'm hungrier than a barracuda.

328
00:24:34,092 --> 00:24:37,208
Bar-ra-cu-da.

329
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:11,125
You wanted to see me, Noumerobis.

330
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,667
My Queen, the palace is getting along nicely but there is not enough time.

331
00:25:15,842 --> 00:25:19,542
That's why I asked some Gallic friends, a druid and 2 warriors...

332
00:25:19,717 --> 00:25:21,792
to help me with my task.

333
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:27,167
I'm here to ask your approval... for their help.

334
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:31,167
If it's OK with you.

335
00:25:32,217 --> 00:25:34,208
I wasn't sure.

336
00:25:34,258 --> 00:25:36,042
You can ask anyone for help.

337
00:25:36,217 --> 00:25:39,833
Finish the palace in time. That's all I ask.

338
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,875
Caesar mocks me every day. I can't afford to loose this bet.

339
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,125
He's completely full of himself.

340
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,583
Completely.

341
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:51,125
Completely.

342
00:26:10,717 --> 00:26:12,667
Listen...

343
00:26:12,842 --> 00:26:14,776
make sure you finish in time and everyone shall receive gold.

344
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,667
I would like that.

345
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:19,542
- Else... the crocodiles. - I wouldn't like that.

346
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:26,167
Now go.

347
00:26:35,133 --> 00:26:38,000
He's cute with that moustache.

348
00:26:38,258 --> 00:26:39,833
A little old.

349
00:26:39,883 --> 00:26:43,458
- No, the other one. - No, too fat.

350
00:26:43,508 --> 00:26:44,792
You do it on purpose?

351
00:26:47,425 --> 00:26:52,333
She's probably got an evil personality, but a lovely nose.

352
00:26:52,758 --> 00:26:55,625
- She'll feed me to the crocodiles. - Very lovely.

353
00:26:55,675 --> 00:27:00,667
Lovely nose, and with a little braid on the side.

354
00:27:01,342 --> 00:27:04,292
I'm going to be crocodile food and he's dreaming about her nose.

355
00:27:04,342 --> 00:27:06,958
Do crocodiles taste nice?

356
00:27:07,508 --> 00:27:10,375
Could you show a little more interest in me?

357
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:15,917
A big ant.

358
00:28:11,508 --> 00:28:12,875
What a crowd!

359
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:17,792
Looks like the biannual cattle market of Lutetia.

360
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:21,792
All new breeds of cows are presented there.

361
00:28:21,842 --> 00:28:23,708
A great show.

362
00:28:23,883 --> 00:28:26,333
Which kind of cows do you have?

363
00:28:27,092 --> 00:28:30,708
Yes, continue. There's nothing going on.

364
00:28:30,758 --> 00:28:33,750
Yes, still a lot of work to be done.

365
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,458
And only 2 months left.

366
00:28:35,508 --> 00:28:40,500
About that magic potion, when I visited you in Gaul...

367
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:44,208
you told me you would take care of things. Now I would like to know...

368
00:28:44,258 --> 00:28:46,750
- I said I would see if I could help. - How do you mean?

369
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,292
- Where did all that sand come from? - That was already here.

370
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:54,833
All those stones were delivered by the Nile Express.

371
00:28:55,008 --> 00:28:57,208
Hitting those slaves is very violent.

372
00:28:57,383 --> 00:29:00,375
They're not slaves. They're construction workers...

373
00:29:00,425 --> 00:29:03,292
they do this voluntarily and they get paid.

374
00:29:03,425 --> 00:29:06,333
- And those whiplashes are for fun? - No.

375
00:29:06,383 --> 00:29:09,750
Yes... I don't know. We haven't had any complaints so far.

376
00:29:09,967 --> 00:29:13,625
- "Istou"? - Maybe it means "continue".

377
00:29:15,675 --> 00:29:18,292
The signal that the soup has arrived.

378
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:21,667
No. They're relieved.

379
00:29:21,842 --> 00:29:24,833
Tradition calls for them to exchange hair.

380
00:29:25,008 --> 00:29:29,083
Now they're bonded by hair.

381
00:29:29,258 --> 00:29:31,625
It's a different culture.

382
00:29:31,675 --> 00:29:34,792
Do you remember that menhir I threw at Caius Bonus?

383
00:29:34,842 --> 00:29:37,583
I bet it weighed just as much as that bunch of stones.

384
00:29:37,633 --> 00:29:41,542
You should ask him. He's best positioned to answer.

385
00:29:49,383 --> 00:29:50,750
It's a different culture.

386
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,292
Another bill. I hate paperwork.

387
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:03,958
Otis, my writer.

388
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:07,375
Writer, that's a comfortable position...

389
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:11,792
I don't think there are any good or bad positions.

390
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:16,417
If I have to summarize my life, I'll start with my encounters.

391
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:21,458
The people that stood up for me, when I was all alone.

392
00:30:21,633 --> 00:30:25,167
It's strange that coincidence determines your faith...

393
00:30:25,217 --> 00:30:29,083
because once you've had a taste of the good life...

394
00:30:29,258 --> 00:30:33,250
it's sometimes hard to find someone to speak to.

395
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,917
The mirror that helps you forward.

396
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:40,333
But not in my case, cause I succeeded. I thank life...

397
00:30:40,383 --> 00:30:43,792
I sing, I dance. I'm love...

398
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:48,708
and when people ask me why I'm so humane...

399
00:30:48,883 --> 00:30:52,667
I tell them it's the taste of love.

400
00:30:52,842 --> 00:30:55,542
Which today leads me to this kind of mechanical construction.

401
00:30:55,592 --> 00:30:59,375
But tomorrow might lead me to be of service to the whole community...

402
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:02,875
and I'll give myself.

403
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:10,417
- What's for dinner this afternoon? - Lentils.

404
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:17,000
I'll be back.

405
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:25,917
This is the place where soon Caesar's Palace will be.

406
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,333
To be finished in 58 days.

407
00:31:32,842 --> 00:31:34,333
What are you looking for?

408
00:31:34,383 --> 00:31:36,917
I've lost my lentil.

409
00:31:38,217 --> 00:31:39,500
Workers

410
00:31:40,342 --> 00:31:42,167
Workers.

411
00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:44,917
Friends.

412
00:31:45,258 --> 00:31:48,250
Have we gone back to the days of the pharaoh's?

413
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:53,417
Slaving away and getting whipped?

414
00:31:55,217 --> 00:31:56,417
And for whom?

415
00:31:57,217 --> 00:31:59,542
For Caesar...

416
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:08,375
Let him build his palace in Rome.

417
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,625
Everyone at his place and the hippos will be fine.

418
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,667
That's true...

419
00:32:24,092 --> 00:32:28,583
Friends, you are being exploited.

420
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:33,708
You're being exhausted and...

421
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:36,625
to be honest...

422
00:32:39,717 --> 00:32:41,417
There.

423
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,208
He's right.

424
00:32:44,508 --> 00:32:47,667
And there two huge statues.

425
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:50,250
But not too huge. 15 meters high is enough.

426
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,833
And at the edge of the sphinxes, a big kitchen.

427
00:32:53,883 --> 00:32:57,958
Next to the bedrooms, that's maybe not ideal.

428
00:32:58,008 --> 00:33:02,042
- Because of the noise and odour? - Could become annoying.

429
00:33:02,092 --> 00:33:03,750
Didn't think about that.

430
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:06,958
Why are those grapes so big?

431
00:33:07,008 --> 00:33:10,875
They're dates, Obelix. They grow on those trees.

432
00:33:14,883 --> 00:33:17,083
- Crunchy on the inside. - That's the stone.

433
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:19,000
Not bad.

434
00:33:23,425 --> 00:33:28,000
Lunch break is over. Get to work!

435
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,917
I hardly said anything. Only that lunch break was over.

436
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,917
We're not satisfied! We're not satisfied!

437
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:40,042
- Please? - Yes...

438
00:33:40,217 --> 00:33:41,857
We're not satisfied! We're not satisfied!

439
00:33:46,675 --> 00:33:50,042
We refuse to work any longer under these conditions.

440
00:33:50,217 --> 00:33:53,708
- It's unbearable. - We're not satisfied!

441
00:33:53,883 --> 00:33:56,250
Calm down, calm down.

442
00:33:57,383 --> 00:33:59,333
We're not satisfied!

443
00:33:59,508 --> 00:34:02,042
Who's in charge?

444
00:34:02,217 --> 00:34:03,958
OK fine.

445
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:06,500
I'll speak for all of us.

446
00:34:07,425 --> 00:34:10,000
- I'm Itineris. - I'm listening.

447
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:13,250
You have two new messages.

448
00:34:13,758 --> 00:34:18,417
First of all: we're working more than 18 hours a day or 36 hours in 2 days.

449
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:21,042
We want it lowered to 35 hours.

450
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,208
That'll never work. It'll cause problems.

451
00:34:23,383 --> 00:34:26,542
Secondly, and sorry for interrupting you...

452
00:34:26,592 --> 00:34:29,125
we want a decrease of at least 50%.

453
00:34:29,175 --> 00:34:31,375
- An increase you mean. - No.

454
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,958
A decrease of the number of whiplashes.

455
00:34:34,133 --> 00:34:36,083
We get too many whiplashes.

456
00:34:36,258 --> 00:34:39,375
Some people get headaches from the noise.

457
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:42,042
- Their head is ready to burst. - Yes...

458
00:34:42,092 --> 00:34:46,667
and concerning the food... Some wild boar alongside the lentils would be nice.

459
00:34:47,217 --> 00:34:50,250
The less whiplashes, the slower you work.

460
00:34:50,425 --> 00:34:53,568
Then the palace doesn't get finished in time, and I'll be fed to the crocodiles.

461
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,042
Enough, Noumerobis. Itineris is right...

462
00:34:56,217 --> 00:34:59,083
to not allow that.

463
00:35:04,008 --> 00:35:07,750
I'm sure they would be happy with some wild boar.

464
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,417
It's Ready.

465
00:35:22,633 --> 00:35:26,542
No, you fell in when you were little.

466
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:29,458
Come on, Idefix.

467
00:35:29,592 --> 00:35:31,833
Give them a demonstration, Asterix.

468
00:35:32,717 --> 00:35:35,375
Be careful, it might be a bit too strong.

469
00:35:41,842 --> 00:35:44,917
- It's a little too strong. - No, it's very good.

470
00:35:55,758 --> 00:35:57,583
Idefix, do a trick.

471
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,125
Do a trick.

472
00:36:26,425 --> 00:36:28,042
Sit!

473
00:36:28,883 --> 00:36:31,208
It's a miracle...

474
00:36:39,633 --> 00:36:41,625
Is there enough for everyone?

475
00:36:41,675 --> 00:36:43,375
I'll make some more.

476
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:47,250
- No, Obelix, you... - Fell in when I was little...

477
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,208
Yes, alright.

478
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:53,042
No! Obelix, no.

479
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:33,125
Hohis. That's his name.

480
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,750
Nobis?

481
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,250
No, Hohis. With an h.

482
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,083
Nexusis.

483
00:39:09,383 --> 00:39:11,042
Can I help you?

484
00:39:11,092 --> 00:39:14,083
- An Imhotep. - Two.

485
00:39:16,175 --> 00:39:18,958
I have a job for you.

486
00:39:19,008 --> 00:39:20,583
No problem. Who do you want me to kill?

487
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,500
No, we're not killing anyone.

488
00:39:24,717 --> 00:39:26,500
Here you go, two Imhoteps.

489
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:31,500
The construction of the palace has to stop.

490
00:39:32,717 --> 00:39:36,458
They're waiting for stones from the south.

491
00:39:36,633 --> 00:39:39,500
Make sure they don't arrive.

492
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:42,250
No stones, no construction.

493
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:46,208
No construction, no palace.

494
00:39:46,508 --> 00:39:47,750
No palace...

495
00:39:49,717 --> 00:39:51,750
no palace.

496
00:39:53,467 --> 00:39:57,000
Here's some gold to cover your expenses.

497
00:39:57,842 --> 00:39:59,625
You give back whatever's left.

498
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:14,000
Nice tunic.

499
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:40,917
I came, I saw, I conquered. Veni, vidi, vici.

500
00:40:40,967 --> 00:40:44,208
The usual stuff. And sign with:

501
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,917
"Cesare".

502
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,542
"Cesare" or "Caesar"?

503
00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:56,542
Caesar. It sounded cool, but... Engrave 4 plates.

504
00:40:58,467 --> 00:41:00,583
Ave Caesar. Power and prosperity...

505
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:03,484
Power and prosperity, Caius C+. Good news?

506
00:41:03,508 --> 00:41:06,500
I came, I saw, I conquered. As usual

507
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:10,083
Veni, vidi, OK. Vici is a little premature.

508
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:11,750
What do you mean?

509
00:41:12,092 --> 00:41:16,250
Gaul for example... What about Gaul?

510
00:41:17,592 --> 00:41:20,625
Gaul is vici. It's completely occupied.

511
00:41:20,675 --> 00:41:24,083
No it isn't. One small village of invincible Gauls still holds out...

512
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:26,250
against the invaders, yes I know.

513
00:41:26,425 --> 00:41:28,833
I've heard it over and over.

514
00:41:29,342 --> 00:41:31,583
And Cleopatra, they stopped construction?

515
00:41:31,633 --> 00:41:34,708
No, it's going fine.

516
00:41:34,883 --> 00:41:39,250
It's beautiful. They even... on the inside...

517
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,167
- No. - Excuse me.

518
00:41:42,342 --> 00:41:46,125
- Don't touch me... - They'll finish in time.

519
00:41:46,508 --> 00:41:47,213
Impossible.

520
00:41:47,225 --> 00:41:49,375
The Gauls don't know the meaning of the word.

521
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:54,292
Noumerobis got 3 of them to help him. One of them is the druid Teachix.

522
00:41:54,342 --> 00:41:55,500
Panoramix?

523
00:41:55,675 --> 00:41:58,292
Yes, I knew it sounded like that.

524
00:41:58,342 --> 00:42:03,000
Also a little clever one and a big brute: Aikix and Journalduhix.

525
00:42:05,342 --> 00:42:07,208
Or Malcomix.

526
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,708
Keep an eye on them for now. I'll decide later what to do.

527
00:42:10,758 --> 00:42:15,333
Si vis pacem, para bellum. If you want peace, prepare for war.

528
00:42:15,883 --> 00:42:20,708
The little Gaul has the name of a hero: Brucewillix.

529
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:30,667
In the mean time, the ruthless Nexusis...

530
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:34,750
sent by Artifis, was completing his mission.

531
00:42:34,967 --> 00:42:37,875
Cut off the supply of stones...

532
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:42,333
by bribing the foul convoy supervisor.

533
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:17,167
There the buildings can form a "C", from Cleopatra.

534
00:43:17,925 --> 00:43:19,583
It's Caesar's palace.

535
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:21,875
- That's possible too. - What do you mean?

536
00:43:22,258 --> 00:43:24,917
The stones have arrived.

537
00:43:32,217 --> 00:43:37,250
The supervisor says there are no more stones in the quarries.

538
00:43:38,008 --> 00:43:41,250
- Funny language. - He wants to be paid.

539
00:43:41,467 --> 00:43:44,833
- He's lying. - No, he really wants to be paid.

540
00:43:45,008 --> 00:43:48,125
No, about the quarries. There have to be more stones.

541
00:43:48,175 --> 00:43:50,542
I could make him talk. Can I?

542
00:43:50,592 --> 00:43:53,458
OK. But don't overdo it, he needs to be able to talk.

543
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,458
How do you say "talk"?

544
00:43:58,633 --> 00:44:02,500
In the sense of "I don't speak Egyptian very well"...

545
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:06,083
it's "medou ene ere comete".

546
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:10,250
If it's "talk a little slower", then it's "medou ere keteb".

547
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,417
- "Medou ere keteb". - No, "ketebece".

548
00:44:12,467 --> 00:44:13,151
"Ketebece".

549
00:44:13,163 --> 00:44:15,250
"Keteb". "Ketebece", when they're 8 of them.

550
00:44:15,425 --> 00:44:17,875
- "Ketebece". - No, not "ketebece".

551
00:44:17,925 --> 00:44:20,208
- No, sorry. - No one understands you.

552
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:22,250
"Keteb" open, "keteb" generious.

553
00:44:22,425 --> 00:44:24,042
Say...

554
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:26,542
"Ouchebe".

555
00:44:30,633 --> 00:44:32,333
"Ouchebe".

556
00:44:32,758 --> 00:44:34,833
No? Not "ouchebe"?

557
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:40,625
No, Obelix, not so furious.

558
00:44:40,883 --> 00:44:45,875
He says Artifis paid him to throw the stones into the Nile.

559
00:44:50,967 --> 00:44:53,958
There are enough stones in the quarry.

560
00:44:57,175 --> 00:45:02,250
- Ai... Ai... He says... - Yes, ai, I understand that part.

561
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,292
He says "ai" because he's in pain. I'm in pain.

562
00:45:06,342 --> 00:45:09,417
Not the moustache. Not the moustache.

563
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:12,625
He's finished.

564
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,333
We'll go with him.

565
00:45:15,383 --> 00:45:19,875
I'll stay here to keep an eye on things. Otis will accompany you to...

566
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:26,833
Yes, to... Here. Amulets.

567
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:30,083
Lucky charms to protect you.

568
00:45:31,175 --> 00:45:32,667
Thanks.

569
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:36,792
- Amsterisque. - Rix.

570
00:45:36,842 --> 00:45:41,250
- Risque. - Yes, rix... Risque.

571
00:45:41,967 --> 00:45:45,083
The faith of Egypt is in your hands.

572
00:45:45,133 --> 00:45:48,083
Isn't that a little exaggerated?

573
00:45:48,842 --> 00:45:52,500
- My faith is in your hands. - That's better.

574
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,417
- Go, Amsterisque! - Rix.

575
00:45:59,467 --> 00:46:00,750
Risque.

576
00:46:05,842 --> 00:46:08,693
So our Gallic friends and Otis went on their way...

577
00:46:08,717 --> 00:46:12,125
to the quarries to get the stones.

578
00:46:14,508 --> 00:46:17,083
What's wrong with your dromedary?

579
00:46:17,133 --> 00:46:19,250
It's my stomach.

580
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,333
While I pack up the boat, you can visit the sphinx.

581
00:46:22,383 --> 00:46:26,042
There will be many restaurants.

582
00:46:26,092 --> 00:46:29,750
You can stuff yourself with all kinds of things...

583
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,875
steamed fish, meat in sauce.

584
00:46:34,133 --> 00:46:36,250
I knew it, nothing to eat.

585
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,250
Nice, those little sphinxes.

586
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,750
I could make little menhirs.

587
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,375
- Sphinx! - Never mind.

588
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,417
- Sphinx! - No, thanks.

589
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,500
Stranger, a portrait with the sphinx as souvenir?

590
00:46:54,675 --> 00:46:56,708
A statue in 30 minutes?

591
00:46:57,258 --> 00:47:00,333
Yes why not? It would look nice at my place.

592
00:47:00,508 --> 00:47:04,750
- Do you accept sestertius? - Sure. Stand in profile please...

593
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:06,500
shoulders up front.

594
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:08,875
Not to far.

595
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:13,958
We have to be more alert. Artifis is a snake.

596
00:47:14,133 --> 00:47:16,917
Besides the transport he could attack the construction site.

597
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,417
We must organise a guard.

598
00:47:19,467 --> 00:47:22,583
What do you think, Obelix?

599
00:47:23,467 --> 00:47:27,125
Now where did he go? Obe?

600
00:47:27,175 --> 00:47:29,083
Obe. Obelix!

601
00:47:32,133 --> 00:47:34,333
- Not to short? - No no.

602
00:47:37,217 --> 00:47:40,417
- So you're from Gaul? - Yes.

603
00:47:40,758 --> 00:47:46,042
Been pretty hefty there lately... Obe...

604
00:47:49,717 --> 00:47:53,333
- Obelix... - Hé! Hé! Asterix!

605
00:47:55,508 --> 00:47:58,208
Obelix, I'm sure that's forbidden.

606
00:48:00,383 --> 00:48:02,542
Come down at once.

607
00:48:16,342 --> 00:48:21,375
How nice... Come down. You're being childish.

608
00:48:21,467 --> 00:48:23,583
You look so small down there.

609
00:48:23,758 --> 00:48:26,708
Don't be stupid. Get off that sphinx.

610
00:48:28,467 --> 00:48:31,083
I'm going to take a walk on his head.

611
00:48:32,425 --> 00:48:34,792
Wise guy.

612
00:48:57,133 --> 00:48:59,208
Broken nose.

613
00:49:02,758 --> 00:49:05,792
Great. Remarkable.

614
00:49:08,508 --> 00:49:10,292
Congratulations, Obelix.

615
00:49:13,633 --> 00:49:15,667
You've outdone yourself this time.

616
00:49:15,717 --> 00:49:17,708
We could attach it again.

617
00:49:17,758 --> 00:49:20,458
Really? That's a great idea.

618
00:49:20,508 --> 00:49:23,125
With what? Did you see the size of that thing?

619
00:49:23,175 --> 00:49:26,026
Yes, it's a rock. A cliff.

620
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:30,083
What am I saying? A peninsula.

621
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:34,458
Stop making everything so complicated and find a solution.

622
00:49:34,508 --> 00:49:37,292
You're so clumsy, Obelix.

623
00:49:38,758 --> 00:49:40,458
Luckily no one saw us.

624
00:49:40,508 --> 00:49:43,417
He said: "Let the Greek balm you."

625
00:49:43,467 --> 00:49:45,333
- Imhotep. - Tep.

626
00:50:06,425 --> 00:50:08,417
Help me, I only have two arms.

627
00:50:15,092 --> 00:50:17,750
Was that lightning?

628
00:50:27,633 --> 00:50:30,375
I told you I saw lightning. I'm not crazy.

629
00:50:35,592 --> 00:50:37,042
Done.

630
00:50:37,383 --> 00:50:40,875
No one will find it there.

631
00:50:41,717 --> 00:50:43,667
Fine, let's get out of here.

632
00:50:43,842 --> 00:50:45,458
Come on, Idefix.

633
00:50:46,508 --> 00:50:49,292
Not a word about this to Panoramix.

634
00:50:49,342 --> 00:50:51,333
- Nothing happened. - No.

635
00:50:51,383 --> 00:50:52,583
Nothing.

636
00:50:57,883 --> 00:51:00,250
Hey, my pyramids...

637
00:51:05,592 --> 00:51:09,542
Seeing the palace is progressing faster than planned...

638
00:51:09,592 --> 00:51:12,833
we demand, which is perfectly normal...

639
00:51:12,883 --> 00:51:16,542
an extra day off.

640
00:51:16,592 --> 00:51:19,333
You understand me, put yourself in my place Adis.

641
00:51:19,383 --> 00:51:20,917
My name's Noumerobis.

642
00:51:20,967 --> 00:51:23,458
What did I say?

643
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,333
Itineris, I don't understand anything.

644
00:51:31,592 --> 00:51:33,417
Try to move a little.

645
00:51:33,467 --> 00:51:35,792
- Now? - No. How about now?

646
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,000
- And now? - Try it.

647
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:41,500
Do you understand me now? Because...

648
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:45,417
I've been having that problem a lot lately.

649
00:51:48,758 --> 00:51:50,792
- Are you alright, Obe? - I'm hungry.

650
00:51:53,383 --> 00:51:55,708
How could the build such a thing?

651
00:51:55,883 --> 00:51:58,167
- Stone upon stone. - Indeed.

652
00:51:58,217 --> 00:52:03,625
Gauls... Feel like visiting the pyramid?

653
00:52:03,675 --> 00:52:05,417
For free.

654
00:52:05,592 --> 00:52:08,333
Not sure if we can learn anything.

655
00:52:08,383 --> 00:52:12,417
They say it's extraordinary. We're not in a hurry.

656
00:52:12,592 --> 00:52:15,458
Stay here, Idefix. Guard Panoramix.

657
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,667
If you're good, I'll give you a bone.

658
00:52:30,592 --> 00:52:35,583
Don't loose track of me. You won't get out of this labyrinth alive.

659
00:52:35,925 --> 00:52:39,125
Watch it, the corridors are very narrow.

660
00:52:39,175 --> 00:52:42,875
- You can't be too fat. - No one is fat.

661
00:52:44,633 --> 00:52:47,250
On your right, Anubis.

662
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,833
- Touching. - The god of the dead.

663
00:52:54,383 --> 00:52:56,083
Through here.

664
00:52:56,967 --> 00:53:00,000
Come, distinguished guests, go in here.

665
00:53:00,217 --> 00:53:04,875
These hieroglyphs are beautiful.

666
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,250
After you. Enter.

667
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,250
Indeed.

668
00:53:14,675 --> 00:53:16,292
No! No!

669
00:53:19,633 --> 00:53:22,167
You'll never get out of here.

670
00:53:24,592 --> 00:53:29,292
This tomb will be your tomb!

671
00:53:32,133 --> 00:53:34,917
No way out. We are stuck.

672
00:53:35,092 --> 00:53:37,875
"This tomb will be your tomb!" Nice one.

673
00:53:37,925 --> 00:53:41,375
- I'm too good. - I knew it. A free visit.

674
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,708
Anyway, enough things to read.

675
00:53:45,758 --> 00:53:48,750
- Hieroglyphs all look alike. - No.

676
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,208
Look, Obelix, the colours... are beautiful.

677
00:53:53,383 --> 00:53:55,625
That's all really nice, but...

678
00:53:55,675 --> 00:53:58,417
if we don't find a way out soon...

679
00:53:58,467 --> 00:54:01,208
we'll have all eternity to figure them out.

680
00:54:02,717 --> 00:54:05,625
That's that.

681
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:08,000
If they get out of here...

682
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:12,125
I swear I'll never shave my head again.

683
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:16,167
First of all we have to get that door open.

684
00:54:16,217 --> 00:54:17,542
But considering the size...

685
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,625
Here, Obelix...

686
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:24,667
for the first time you can have some magic potion..

687
00:54:24,842 --> 00:54:27,167
- Really? - That's what we said didn't we.

688
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:33,292
One, two, three drops.

689
00:54:33,467 --> 00:54:36,000
That's enough.

690
00:54:56,633 --> 00:55:01,708
Well... That didn't seem to do anything.

691
00:55:15,008 --> 00:55:16,333
No, it's Pano.

692
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,583
Yes, I'm here.

693
00:55:22,842 --> 00:55:24,292
Here.

694
00:55:29,842 --> 00:55:32,458
We're running in circles.

695
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,583
The pharaoh's had splendid architects.

696
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,167
- We're in a serious situation here. - Very serious.

697
00:55:39,342 --> 00:55:41,125
I'm starting to get hungry.

698
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:44,500
What do those hieroglyphs mean?

699
00:55:45,758 --> 00:55:49,542
There's no time to find out, we have to get out of here.

700
00:55:49,717 --> 00:55:53,458
We must set our priorities straight.

701
00:55:53,508 --> 00:55:57,083
I'm reporting to mister Asterix that's I'm hungry.

702
00:55:57,133 --> 00:56:01,250
I keep myself busy to forget I'm hungry.

703
00:56:01,425 --> 00:56:05,708
I forgot mister Obelix's stomach was more important.

704
00:56:05,758 --> 00:56:09,083
Wild boars and fights, that's all he needs.

705
00:56:09,258 --> 00:56:12,542
Mister Asterix knows everything better.

706
00:56:12,717 --> 00:56:15,583
- Yes, maybe. - I'm reporting to mister Asterix...

707
00:56:15,758 --> 00:56:20,125
who wanted to visit the pyramid that this wouldn't have happened in a menhir.

708
00:56:22,342 --> 00:56:24,875
2 Sestertius for that logic.

709
00:56:29,217 --> 00:56:30,875
What's keeping them?

710
00:56:31,925 --> 00:56:36,042
The stones are loaded. We have to leave.

711
00:56:39,425 --> 00:56:43,042
I was excited. I was just saying something. Mea culpa.

712
00:56:43,092 --> 00:56:46,250
No, I said mea culpa.

713
00:56:46,508 --> 00:56:49,359
It also could have happened in a menhir.

714
00:56:49,383 --> 00:56:53,250
In any case, I can't get us out of this place.

715
00:56:53,717 --> 00:56:58,417
My friends, I fear this is the end of our adventures.

716
00:57:04,425 --> 00:57:06,417
Could someone light a torch?

717
00:57:06,467 --> 00:57:10,667
No, I have the amulets, but that's not going to help.

718
00:57:10,717 --> 00:57:13,000
I'm sorry for Noumerobis.

719
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:16,167
I'm sorry for Idefix.

720
00:57:16,217 --> 00:57:18,917
- Or not, Idefix? - Idefix?

721
00:57:18,967 --> 00:57:23,125
Yes, so? Don't blame me for bringing him!

722
00:57:23,175 --> 00:57:25,667
His sense of smell lead him to us.

723
00:57:25,717 --> 00:57:28,500
So he can get us out of here.

724
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:31,208
That's true! Idefix, listen very carefully.

725
00:57:31,258 --> 00:57:36,333
If you get us out of here, I'll give you a pile full of bones.

726
00:57:53,758 --> 00:57:57,125
Yes! That's good... Idefix!

727
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,875
Excuse me, we're fortunate you brought him.

728
00:57:59,925 --> 00:58:04,167
Sometimes I think he understands everything I say.

729
00:58:08,592 --> 00:58:11,125
And they returned to the construction site...

730
00:58:11,175 --> 00:58:14,583
aboard ships loaded with stones.

731
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:17,750
- We're going slowly. - Very slow.

732
00:58:17,925 --> 00:58:19,458
Too slow.

733
00:58:19,675 --> 00:58:23,250
At this speed we won't be back in time for the wild board banquet...

734
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,042
lentils aren't that great...

735
00:58:25,092 --> 00:58:28,708
The Nile is an unpredictable river...

736
00:58:28,758 --> 00:58:31,750
sometimes impetuous, sometimes quiet.

737
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,917
I wonder if you know this nice Egyptian poem.

738
00:58:35,967 --> 00:58:39,750
It goes like this: "Nile, Nile, Nile..."

739
00:58:46,967 --> 00:58:48,875
What's he doing?

740
00:58:58,842 --> 00:59:00,417
Men!

741
00:59:01,675 --> 00:59:03,917
We're seaworthy again.

742
00:59:04,092 --> 00:59:05,708
- Hip hip hip... - Hurrah.

743
00:59:05,883 --> 00:59:07,750
- Hip hip hip... - Hurrah.

744
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,500
Watch out!

745
00:59:38,092 --> 00:59:42,083
By Toutatis, I know he fell...

746
00:59:42,258 --> 00:59:44,875
in a cauldron of magic potion...

747
00:59:44,925 --> 00:59:47,792
but he'll never cease to amaze me.

748
00:59:50,008 --> 00:59:53,708
- Hip hip hip... hurrah... - Stop it.

749
00:59:54,175 --> 00:59:56,958
And construction was ready to start again.

750
00:59:57,008 --> 01:00:00,875
Noumerobis knew he would be finished in time...

751
01:00:00,925 --> 01:00:03,542
which, in the field of construction, was rare in those days.

752
01:00:03,925 --> 01:00:08,500
One sip a person. Just one sip a person.

753
01:00:08,675 --> 01:00:11,792
Fake potion is being spread.

754
01:00:11,967 --> 01:00:16,792
Same consistency, same colour, but it's pumpkin soup.

755
01:00:16,967 --> 01:00:20,667
The only real potion, is the one you get from the druid...

756
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:22,125
around the cauldron.

757
01:00:22,508 --> 01:00:25,875
Thirty minutes from here.

758
01:00:27,717 --> 01:00:29,833
I closed the door and yelled:

759
01:00:29,883 --> 01:00:33,000
"This tomb will be your tomb."

760
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:34,750
Not bad.

761
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,417
I was also thinking: "Jackals, die like jackals".

762
01:00:38,467 --> 01:00:40,417
But that's jackals twice.

763
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:45,833
What? They say hyenas?

764
01:00:45,883 --> 01:00:48,000
Locked up in the pyramid?

765
01:00:48,175 --> 01:00:49,625
I don't understand.

766
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:54,292
They're magicians. You need supernatural powers to get out of there.

767
01:00:54,342 --> 01:00:56,250
They're tuff, those barbarians.

768
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:59,708
I need an idea.

769
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:05,208
Got one. I have a terrible idea. Two. Even three.

770
01:01:05,258 --> 01:01:09,542
I've got a whole bunch of ideas. I'm so good.

771
01:01:12,967 --> 01:01:16,583
I don't like that laugh. It frightens me.

772
01:01:16,633 --> 01:01:18,417
Get to work!

773
01:01:23,633 --> 01:01:27,583
That's not even close to the luxurious garden we need.

774
01:01:29,258 --> 01:01:33,792
Panomanix, you don't have any potion to speed things up?

775
01:01:33,967 --> 01:01:37,667
Like seeds for example...

776
01:01:37,717 --> 01:01:40,792
that grow into palm trees within no time?

777
01:01:40,842 --> 01:01:44,042
No, potions aren't the solution to everything.

778
01:01:44,217 --> 01:01:46,458
Some things can't be changed.

779
01:01:46,633 --> 01:01:51,000
Nature needs time to turn the seed...

780
01:01:51,175 --> 01:01:54,833
with sun and water, into a bud...

781
01:01:56,342 --> 01:01:58,500
and then...

782
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,833
- that bud... - Please.

783
01:02:04,925 --> 01:02:06,708
Please.

784
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,667
It can't go any faster.

785
01:02:39,883 --> 01:02:42,000
Yes, fantastic!

786
01:02:50,592 --> 01:02:52,875
Can someone get me down from this tree?

787
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,708
They started again?

788
01:03:02,883 --> 01:03:06,083
I'm not happy either.

789
01:03:06,258 --> 01:03:10,625
I also want Noumerobis to fail, for personal reasons.

790
01:03:10,675 --> 01:03:14,792
I was thinking I could be of some assistance maybe.

791
01:03:14,842 --> 01:03:19,375
After we've struck a fair deal...

792
01:03:20,342 --> 01:03:23,458
Not here. In my tent.

793
01:03:28,633 --> 01:03:30,458
I'm listening.

794
01:03:30,508 --> 01:03:35,667
Honourable Caesar, if I see to it the construction of the palace fails..

795
01:03:35,717 --> 01:03:39,833
You'll appoint me and I'll finish the job in 2 months.

796
01:03:39,883 --> 01:03:44,000
That way you win the bet and Cleopatra is humiliated.

797
01:03:45,633 --> 01:03:48,083
Alright, if you finish it after 4 months.

798
01:03:48,133 --> 01:03:49,792
Three, I can't work any slower.

799
01:03:49,842 --> 01:03:53,708
Fine, but not any sooner, or you'll have to pay a compensation.

800
01:03:55,425 --> 01:03:58,833
That's a deal, honourable Caesar.

801
01:04:03,133 --> 01:04:06,750
How were you planning to sabotage the construction.

802
01:04:08,133 --> 01:04:10,167
With this.

803
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:24,125
What shall I wear tonight?

804
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:27,042
Careful, it's very, very tepid.

805
01:04:37,758 --> 01:04:39,750
A gift for the queen of queens.

806
01:04:41,842 --> 01:04:45,875
"As a token of honour to the queen of queens. The 3 Gauls:

807
01:04:45,925 --> 01:04:50,375
Panoramix, Obelix and Asterix." How sweet.

808
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:54,042
Can I open it?

809
01:04:56,175 --> 01:04:57,917
Oh, that's tepid.

810
01:05:00,133 --> 01:05:01,583
A cake.

811
01:05:01,758 --> 01:05:03,542
Tonight's desert.

812
01:05:03,717 --> 01:05:06,750
Modest meal, 40 dancers...

813
01:05:06,925 --> 01:05:09,667
80 musicians and 300 simple dishes.

814
01:05:09,842 --> 01:05:12,292
I don't like crowds either.

815
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,042
Dinnertime!

816
01:05:15,217 --> 01:05:18,375
- Ah wild boar... - Finally some normal food.

817
01:05:18,425 --> 01:05:21,292
- Yes. - With lentils.

818
01:05:21,342 --> 01:05:25,542
That's not really allowed. It's pork more or less.

819
01:05:25,717 --> 01:05:28,958
- We'll pretend we don't know. - Nobody moves.

820
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:31,125
We're here to arrest the Gauls.

821
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,917
Come on, for three wild boars.

822
01:05:34,092 --> 01:05:37,083
I'll beat them up and then we'll eat.

823
01:05:37,258 --> 01:05:41,958
No, wait. Wait! You're going to fight the whole garrison?

824
01:05:42,008 --> 01:05:46,500
Why not? That's illegal too? You can't do anything around here.

825
01:05:46,675 --> 01:05:48,958
Noumerobis is right. We're going to see Cleopatra.

826
01:05:49,008 --> 01:05:52,083
Yes, nice opportunity to see the palace.

827
01:05:52,133 --> 01:05:56,417
I'll stay here to keep an eye on the fire. It tends to go out.

828
01:05:56,467 --> 01:05:59,500
That's why I want to stay.

829
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:15,625
Everything is tasted beforehand.

830
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,000
Your scheme failed, Gauls.

831
01:06:18,175 --> 01:06:21,542
My taster was poisoned by your cake.

832
01:06:21,883 --> 01:06:24,292
We didn't send any cake. What cake?

833
01:06:24,467 --> 01:06:27,333
That cake. I don't see fifty others.

834
01:06:27,508 --> 01:06:30,208
The wild boars, OK, but for that...

835
01:06:30,383 --> 01:06:33,042
Silence! You tried to kill me.

836
01:06:33,217 --> 01:06:36,583
- You will die. - By Toutatis! We are innocent.

837
01:06:36,758 --> 01:06:39,833
- You have some nerve. - Ridiculous. We work...

838
01:06:40,008 --> 01:06:44,750
all day, breath dust... - Eat lentils... - Yes, no...

839
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,583
- Yes we do, lentils. - Yes, but...

840
01:06:46,758 --> 01:06:50,000
We didn't send you any poisonous cake.

841
01:06:50,175 --> 01:06:54,083
A cake like that we would have eaten ourselves.

842
01:06:55,008 --> 01:06:56,792
Silence!

843
01:06:57,342 --> 01:07:00,458
- This is ridiculous. - If she doesn't want to hear it...

844
01:07:00,508 --> 01:07:02,708
you don't say anything. For now.

845
01:07:02,758 --> 01:07:04,333
Take them away.

846
01:07:04,508 --> 01:07:07,583
And give the crocodiles an appetizer.

847
01:07:15,342 --> 01:07:17,333
I'm hungry.

848
01:07:21,008 --> 01:07:23,917
I'm hungry. Hungry!

849
01:07:25,425 --> 01:07:28,500
When I said hello, she turned her head.

850
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:33,083
We used to laugh, said cuckoo... and now...

851
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:34,667
all of a sudden...

852
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:38,792
she won't look at me any more. I'm a stranger to her.

853
01:07:38,842 --> 01:07:40,958
Cleopatra and you said cuckoo?

854
01:07:41,133 --> 01:07:45,958
He's not talking about Cleopatra, but about a courtesan.

855
01:07:46,342 --> 01:07:48,417
The one with the nice braid.

856
01:07:49,675 --> 01:07:52,708
Wouldn't surprise me if he were in love.

857
01:07:52,883 --> 01:07:54,500
I'm not in love.

858
01:07:55,133 --> 01:07:58,125
I want to tell her I had nothing to do with it.

859
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:01,375
It's a juridical thing.

860
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:03,667
Juridical, yes.

861
01:08:03,717 --> 01:08:05,083
Of course.

862
01:08:06,425 --> 01:08:08,167
- Stop. - Cuckoo, I love you.

863
01:08:09,717 --> 01:08:13,333
It's great to look so stupid...

864
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:17,167
Subtle...

865
01:08:17,342 --> 01:08:22,208
Sometimes you can be really nice, and sometimes we think you're...

866
01:08:22,383 --> 01:08:25,167
- a fat idiot... - Who's an idiot?

867
01:08:25,342 --> 01:08:28,500
- No idea. - Drink. A sip of antidote.

868
01:08:29,717 --> 01:08:32,250
Obelix, not everything. A sip.

869
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:33,750
Yes, a sip.

870
01:08:33,925 --> 01:08:36,708
Now... Obelix, open the door.

871
01:08:36,758 --> 01:08:40,958
I didn't drink it all. Get out of my way.

872
01:08:41,008 --> 01:08:44,792
Yes, and when you come back you'll bring me a suit...

873
01:08:45,425 --> 01:08:50,167
Egyptians are mad. We ask them to get out of the way but they don't move.

874
01:08:55,508 --> 01:08:58,250
- And? - I'm ready.

875
01:09:00,092 --> 01:09:02,958
I'm sick of standing in profile all the time.

876
01:09:03,008 --> 01:09:06,167
Can't you sketch my front for a change? Like this...

877
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:11,250
Modern art... Please?

878
01:09:15,258 --> 01:09:16,375
Can we?

879
01:09:17,633 --> 01:09:19,417
I'd better leave.

880
01:09:19,592 --> 01:09:23,125
Gauls, since you want to see my demise...

881
01:09:23,175 --> 01:09:26,500
I'll, by Osiris, show you how a queen dies.

882
01:09:26,675 --> 01:09:29,542
No, by Toutatis, listen to us first.

883
01:09:29,675 --> 01:09:31,792
- Where are your courtesans? - Why?

884
01:09:31,842 --> 01:09:35,583
No reason. I'm sure the cake wasn't poisoned.

885
01:09:35,633 --> 01:09:37,542
I think it's very tasty even.

886
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:42,500
Obelix, cut 3 pieces of cake.

887
01:09:47,425 --> 01:09:48,792
We said three piece.

888
01:09:48,967 --> 01:09:50,500
One...

889
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:54,833
- Go on. - Two.

890
01:09:56,467 --> 01:09:58,125
And three.

891
01:09:58,717 --> 01:09:59,958
Obviously.

892
01:10:08,717 --> 01:10:11,708
And? You can see it's not poisoned.

893
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:15,375
Tell your courtesans. Especially the one with the braid.

894
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:18,500
- Her name is Guimieukis. - Guimieukis.

895
01:10:28,842 --> 01:10:31,500
I had a dream last night.

896
01:10:32,675 --> 01:10:35,417
I'd won a million sestertius.

897
01:10:35,467 --> 01:10:39,875
I bought, shoes. Too big, and ugly too.

898
01:10:39,925 --> 01:10:43,625
Unbelievable. And weird, because...

899
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,750
That Egyptian architect and his proposition...

900
01:10:46,925 --> 01:10:48,667
- Ilemauris? - Artifis.

901
01:10:48,842 --> 01:10:51,792
- Yes. - Incompetent. He hasn't achieved anything.

902
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:56,250
Send one of ours, to spy and snoop around.

903
01:10:57,133 --> 01:11:00,333
Thinking of someone in particular, O Caesar?

904
01:11:00,383 --> 01:11:06,208
Someone sneaky... - Cartapus! - Yes.

905
01:11:06,967 --> 01:11:09,458
Caesar, meet Cartapus.

906
01:11:09,633 --> 01:11:11,417
Our best spy.

907
01:11:11,592 --> 01:11:14,458
Ave Caesar. Power and prosperity.

908
01:11:14,925 --> 01:11:18,833
Cartapus is a professional. The queen of camouflage.

909
01:11:19,717 --> 01:11:22,417
If I look that way, you can see me.

910
01:11:22,925 --> 01:11:24,500
When I look this way, you don't.

911
01:11:25,133 --> 01:11:28,583
You can. You can't. You can.

912
01:11:28,758 --> 01:11:31,417
- Can't. Can't. Can. - Incredible.

913
01:11:31,467 --> 01:11:34,000
You can't. Can't. Can.

914
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:37,375
You can. Can't. You can a little.

915
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:47,583
- Amazing. - Yes.

916
01:11:48,258 --> 01:11:49,625
She wasn't even trying hard.

917
01:11:55,883 --> 01:11:57,958
They mock me.

918
01:12:03,092 --> 01:12:05,042
- Four months... - Don't rush me.

919
01:12:05,217 --> 01:12:08,667
- I've been waiting four months. - My mother will kill me.

920
01:12:08,717 --> 01:12:12,042
- I have connections. - Come one, stay calm.

921
01:12:12,092 --> 01:12:14,667
Don't touch me! Impossible to stay calm.

922
01:12:14,717 --> 01:12:17,750
Malococsis, tomorrow I'll finish everything.

923
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:21,542
I'll even give you a discount. I'd like that.

924
01:12:21,592 --> 01:12:23,333
He'd like that.

925
01:12:23,383 --> 01:12:27,917
If you're not there tomorrow, I'd rather not be in your place.

926
01:12:35,175 --> 01:12:36,333
And?

927
01:12:36,508 --> 01:12:38,750
The magic potion gives them incredible strength.

928
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:43,000
I drank it and now I'm superman. Superwoman.

929
01:12:45,967 --> 01:12:47,833
You don't believe me, O Caesar?

930
01:12:47,883 --> 01:12:50,167
We shall see.

931
01:12:50,342 --> 01:12:54,458
Malivestus! Slap her.

932
01:13:32,133 --> 01:13:34,984
Caesar will personally deal with this matter.

933
01:13:35,008 --> 01:13:38,917
The dice is cast. Alea jacta est. Excuse me.

934
01:13:45,633 --> 01:13:51,167
In the name of Caesar! We know the Gauls are hiding here.

935
01:13:51,342 --> 01:13:55,292
I demand that Appendix, Olympix and Mannekepix...

936
01:13:55,467 --> 01:13:57,917
No, their names are Asterix...

937
01:13:58,092 --> 01:14:00,125
Their names don't matter!

938
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:04,250
If they don't surrender immediately we'll attack.

939
01:14:04,425 --> 01:14:07,292
We're here to help Cleopatra.

940
01:14:07,467 --> 01:14:09,792
By Toutatis, we're not leaving until the work is finished.

941
01:14:09,967 --> 01:14:13,750
Don't be so aggressive. Maybe we can talk!

942
01:14:13,925 --> 01:14:16,167
We'll kill you all.

943
01:14:16,342 --> 01:14:17,958
I knew it.

944
01:14:18,008 --> 01:14:22,542
Jeanclaudus. Prepare the troops. And show no mercy.

945
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:24,500
Antivirus.

946
01:14:24,842 --> 01:14:27,000
My name is Antivirus.

947
01:14:36,217 --> 01:14:42,208
Arm yourself. One, two, three... four, six... five...

948
01:14:42,592 --> 01:14:44,333
Come on.

949
01:14:49,508 --> 01:14:50,583
Get in line.

950
01:15:08,467 --> 01:15:12,375
Here. Put him in some shade.

951
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:16,833
So, amateurs, coming to see the professionals at work?

952
01:15:16,883 --> 01:15:19,167
Yes, alright.

953
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:29,708
Yes, if you're not used to it, it's rather impressive.

954
01:15:30,467 --> 01:15:34,292
- Panomanix, magic potion for the workers. - It's their day off.

955
01:15:37,217 --> 01:15:44,958
So... This is the palace, there are the gardens.

956
01:15:45,133 --> 01:15:48,042
And there is the temple with the sphinxes.

957
01:15:48,092 --> 01:15:50,708
That's not a good drawing.

958
01:15:50,758 --> 01:15:53,125
No, I'm merely sketching.

959
01:15:53,175 --> 01:15:56,458
In perspective it's more like...

960
01:15:56,508 --> 01:15:59,125
I would have drawn it more in profile.

961
01:15:59,175 --> 01:16:01,542
Yes, you do it all the time...

962
01:16:13,258 --> 01:16:16,000
Those Romans are mad.

963
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:21,375
Because of the violence in the next scene...

964
01:16:21,425 --> 01:16:25,375
we prefer to broadcast this documentary.

965
01:16:26,842 --> 01:16:28,958
In contrary to common belief...

966
01:16:29,008 --> 01:16:32,417
the langoustine feeds exclusively on shellfish.

967
01:16:32,883 --> 01:16:36,667
Which doesn't bother his humanity.

968
01:16:43,967 --> 01:16:46,208
Careful...

969
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,875
One got through. Idefix, attack!

970
01:17:05,383 --> 01:17:08,875
Leave me alone. I've been beaten already.

971
01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:13,042
Alright.

972
01:17:14,925 --> 01:17:18,958
Sir, we don't allow such speeding here.

973
01:17:19,008 --> 01:17:21,458
We're not in Rome.

974
01:17:26,258 --> 01:17:29,500
Ave Caius C+, they withstood the attack...

975
01:17:29,675 --> 01:17:32,208
but some managed to get very close to the enemy.

976
01:17:32,258 --> 01:17:35,042
Bravo, brave soldiers.

977
01:17:35,342 --> 01:17:37,500
They shouldn't have challenged me.

978
01:17:37,550 --> 01:17:38,792
And what's that?

979
01:17:40,175 --> 01:17:45,000
We got right up to them... but they were nice.

980
01:17:45,175 --> 01:17:48,500
They let us go without beating us too much.

981
01:17:48,883 --> 01:17:52,917
What will we do now? I'm asking, as an amateur.

982
01:17:52,967 --> 01:17:54,458
Attack again!

983
01:17:54,508 --> 01:17:59,125
Caius C+, I'm not sure that's a good idea.

984
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:02,292
The Gauls are invincible...

985
01:18:02,342 --> 01:18:05,193
I think we better give up...

986
01:18:05,217 --> 01:18:09,875
I'm very disappointed by your attitude, centurion Antiquarus.

987
01:18:09,925 --> 01:18:13,250
Antivirus. My name is Antivirus.

988
01:18:14,133 --> 01:18:18,708
No one humiliates the Roman empire. If it's attacked...

989
01:18:19,675 --> 01:18:22,542
the empire counterattacks.

990
01:18:22,925 --> 01:18:26,792
He's mad. He hurt my throat.

991
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:45,708
It's too quiet.

992
01:18:46,675 --> 01:18:49,667
I don't like that.

993
01:18:50,467 --> 01:18:55,417
I prefer a little commotion.

994
01:19:06,383 --> 01:19:08,000
Stop!

995
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,333
War machines... Take your positions.

996
01:19:13,633 --> 01:19:15,458
How low can you go.

997
01:19:20,508 --> 01:19:22,750
Beautiful landscape.

998
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,583
Not good, not bad either.

999
01:19:25,758 --> 01:19:27,750
Fire! Destroy the palace!

1000
01:19:29,258 --> 01:19:31,208
- Ready? - Ready.

1001
01:19:31,758 --> 01:19:34,333
When I lower my arm...

1002
01:19:36,717 --> 01:19:37,833
you fire.

1003
01:19:38,008 --> 01:19:39,667
Easy.

1004
01:19:44,883 --> 01:19:47,000
There... bingo.

1005
01:19:47,175 --> 01:19:48,292
My palace!

1006
01:20:14,383 --> 01:20:18,375
I wonder why all this violence is necessary.

1007
01:20:19,592 --> 01:20:20,792
No, it's fine.

1008
01:20:25,175 --> 01:20:26,542
Come!

1009
01:20:37,758 --> 01:20:40,042
Fine. Excellent.

1010
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:52,333
With such equipment it's easy.

1011
01:20:52,758 --> 01:20:56,458
- It's not about the equipment. - Oh yes it is.

1012
01:20:56,508 --> 01:20:58,250
- No. - Yes.

1013
01:20:58,550 --> 01:21:01,000
- No. - Yes.

1014
01:21:01,758 --> 01:21:03,333
No.

1015
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:05,208
Yes.

1016
01:21:06,883 --> 01:21:10,208
My palace is turned into a ruin.

1017
01:21:11,717 --> 01:21:16,208
Go on, Romans, fire. We no longer care.

1018
01:21:25,925 --> 01:21:29,125
You missed. You shoot like girls.

1019
01:21:35,508 --> 01:21:37,333
We're still here.

1020
01:21:37,675 --> 01:21:41,167
We must inform Cleopatra. She could force...

1021
01:21:41,217 --> 01:21:43,833
Caesar to stop.

1022
01:21:46,967 --> 01:21:49,292
No. No.

1023
01:21:49,633 --> 01:21:50,958
No.

1024
01:21:51,675 --> 01:21:53,083
- No. - Yes.

1025
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:59,042
Yours sincerely...

1026
01:22:03,842 --> 01:22:08,042
I have an idea. Idefix will bring the message.

1027
01:22:08,217 --> 01:22:10,875
Idefix will bring the message.

1028
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:13,833
That dog? You want me to die?

1029
01:22:13,967 --> 01:22:18,167
Noumerobis is right. I mean... it's a dog.

1030
01:22:18,342 --> 01:22:19,875
He got us out of the pyramid.

1031
01:22:20,425 --> 01:22:21,425
Go on, Idefix.

1032
01:22:21,883 --> 01:22:24,750
Take this message to Cleopatra.

1033
01:22:25,342 --> 01:22:28,542
He's too young to understand.

1034
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,083
I'm hit.

1035
01:22:40,383 --> 01:22:42,000
Never mind, I'm fine.

1036
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:51,042
Men! We're seaworthy yet again.

1037
01:22:51,092 --> 01:22:54,125
Aboard our trusty old dragon boat.

1038
01:22:54,175 --> 01:22:59,542
It's an extraordinary mast, subtle as a bird. Hoist the sail.

1039
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,333
Yes.

1040
01:23:04,842 --> 01:23:06,500
No.

1041
01:23:27,633 --> 01:23:28,833
No.

1042
01:23:30,425 --> 01:23:32,208
Too far.

1043
01:23:39,008 --> 01:23:40,375
I'm amazed.

1044
01:23:42,758 --> 01:23:44,625
It should hold.

1045
01:23:47,758 --> 01:23:49,917
A big sip. I'm leaving but I'll be back.

1046
01:23:49,967 --> 01:23:53,458
Hurry and be careful.

1047
01:23:58,550 --> 01:24:00,583
Hold on, Idefix.

1048
01:24:02,758 --> 01:24:06,167
Run, Asterisque, run!

1049
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:07,800
Alarm!

1050
01:24:08,342 --> 01:24:11,417
I know that one. He's a grumpy man.

1051
01:24:12,342 --> 01:24:13,750
Shields!

1052
01:24:16,592 --> 01:24:17,792
Javelin!

1053
01:24:20,925 --> 01:24:22,917
Why isn't he stopping?

1054
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:32,792
The magic potion!

1055
01:24:36,842 --> 01:24:40,042
Citebus, Trolleybus, get him! Quickly!

1056
01:24:40,092 --> 01:24:42,833
- Go on! - But that's not my name.

1057
01:24:45,925 --> 01:24:48,542
Obelix is alone. Go help him.

1058
01:24:52,467 --> 01:24:54,458
I'm strong now?

1059
01:25:37,508 --> 01:25:39,375
Noumerobis...

1060
01:25:41,550 --> 01:25:43,750
prepare your sarcophagus.

1061
01:26:02,633 --> 01:26:04,792
Double evasion.

1062
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,833
Pryadonis, violence...

1063
01:26:18,175 --> 01:26:20,500
never solved anything.

1064
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:21,833
Stop talking.

1065
01:26:25,758 --> 01:26:28,792
Wait, I didn't drink any magic potion.

1066
01:26:53,383 --> 01:26:56,125
- You lost. - Are you sure?

1067
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,417
- Very sure. - OK.

1068
01:27:16,342 --> 01:27:19,208
No, no! I beg you, no!

1069
01:27:28,008 --> 01:27:31,917
I'm Artifis, and I beat Noumerobis...

1070
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:46,417
The magic potion has worn off.

1071
01:27:46,467 --> 01:27:49,417
Cleopatra will never get the message.

1072
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:01,583
- Your family is fine? - Yes. Imhotep.

1073
01:28:01,758 --> 01:28:05,375
- And your father? - Fine, Imhotep. And your sister.

1074
01:28:05,425 --> 01:28:06,833
Everything's OK. Imhotep.

1075
01:28:07,008 --> 01:28:09,583
What has become of your nephew?

1076
01:28:09,633 --> 01:28:11,125
He's doing fine, Imhotep.

1077
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:13,917
And how's business?

1078
01:28:14,092 --> 01:28:16,083
Sorry, I'm borrowing this cart for a moment.

1079
01:28:27,342 --> 01:28:30,208
- Many customers? - Enough, Imhotep.

1080
01:28:40,967 --> 01:28:42,583
How useful.

1081
01:28:42,758 --> 01:28:46,458
- We can't catch him. - He's got one with 2 horses.

1082
01:28:46,508 --> 01:28:48,333
I can't go any faster.

1083
01:28:55,133 --> 01:28:57,667
Why does everyone always shout " ja, ja"?

1084
01:28:59,050 --> 01:29:01,125
Catch me if you can.

1085
01:29:20,383 --> 01:29:22,250
How will you get up?

1086
01:29:23,675 --> 01:29:25,583
Like this.

1087
01:29:27,342 --> 01:29:31,583
Fighting is ridiculous. Let's work together.

1088
01:29:31,758 --> 01:29:34,667
A lion doesn't cooperate with a cockroach.

1089
01:29:35,508 --> 01:29:36,958
What?

1090
01:29:37,133 --> 01:29:40,667
A lion, you know, doesn't cooperate...

1091
01:29:40,842 --> 01:29:42,250
with a cockroach.

1092
01:29:42,425 --> 01:29:48,000
I understood: "an ion... doesn't calculate.

1093
01:29:48,175 --> 01:29:50,208
- That means nothing to me. - No.

1094
01:29:51,467 --> 01:29:53,000
Attack!

1095
01:30:03,008 --> 01:30:05,542
When I said lion I meant myself!

1096
01:30:05,592 --> 01:30:07,583
I knew that.

1097
01:30:12,967 --> 01:30:14,250
What's going on?

1098
01:30:28,717 --> 01:30:30,792
The lion doesn't cooperate with the cockroach.

1099
01:30:42,592 --> 01:30:45,042
Who's the lion now?

1100
01:30:45,883 --> 01:30:49,000
Say it to my face, if you're a man.

1101
01:31:19,342 --> 01:31:20,542
Everything OK?

1102
01:31:29,175 --> 01:31:31,583
By Jupiter, a moment ago he was still here.

1103
01:31:31,633 --> 01:31:35,917
We're going home. Gone is gone.

1104
01:31:37,925 --> 01:31:40,583
I've had it with Noumerobis.

1105
01:31:40,633 --> 01:31:42,250
- Where are we going? - To Cleopatra.

1106
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:44,333
- I'm scared. - Yes, play it smart.

1107
01:31:44,508 --> 01:31:48,792
I know Cleopatra very well. Watch me.

1108
01:31:48,842 --> 01:31:51,333
I'm afraid I have no choice.

1109
01:31:51,967 --> 01:31:55,958
One, two, three, four, five.

1110
01:31:56,008 --> 01:31:57,917
Antelope and lion.

1111
01:31:57,967 --> 01:31:59,958
What does the prediction say?

1112
01:32:00,008 --> 01:32:02,500
A message and a loved one.

1113
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:04,083
Whatever.

1114
01:32:04,258 --> 01:32:06,500
- My queen... - Malococsis.

1115
01:32:06,675 --> 01:32:10,708
- Come on in. - Go, Idefix. Give her the message.

1116
01:32:14,342 --> 01:32:17,375
- That's the message. - And there's the loved one.

1117
01:32:20,633 --> 01:32:24,167
My queen, as you may know I'm building.

1118
01:32:24,842 --> 01:32:29,125
In fact, it should have been easily finished four months ago.

1119
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:30,792
- What? - Easily.

1120
01:32:31,842 --> 01:32:33,750
He can't get away with that!

1121
01:32:33,925 --> 01:32:37,375
Thank you, my queen, that you care so much.

1122
01:32:37,550 --> 01:32:40,292
By Isis, he's a sore looser.

1123
01:32:40,467 --> 01:32:42,750
This is typical of Caesar. But this time...

1124
01:32:42,925 --> 01:32:47,667
he'll have to accept his defeat. We will finish in time.

1125
01:32:47,842 --> 01:32:50,917
No, the construction isn't finished. That's exactly the problem.

1126
01:32:50,967 --> 01:32:52,917
I'll see to it. You can go now, Gaul.

1127
01:32:54,342 --> 01:32:57,833
Guimieukis, show him the way. I'll be right there.

1128
01:32:59,758 --> 01:33:01,875
Pardon me, old man.

1129
01:33:03,175 --> 01:33:06,792
- Come, my Idefix. - Come, my Gaul.

1130
01:33:07,342 --> 01:33:10,208
I believe you don't understand my problem.

1131
01:33:13,717 --> 01:33:15,792
It's that way. Straight ahead.

1132
01:33:15,842 --> 01:33:18,292
- Be careful. - Yes.

1133
01:33:31,592 --> 01:33:33,708
Everything will be destroyed.

1134
01:33:33,883 --> 01:33:37,875
Everything will be fine Tranquilum.

1135
01:33:38,008 --> 01:33:40,167
That attack was a good idea, wasn't it?

1136
01:33:40,217 --> 01:33:43,375
Yes, not bad.

1137
01:33:50,258 --> 01:33:52,042
Asterix is coming back.

1138
01:33:56,967 --> 01:33:58,917
When I lower my arm...

1139
01:34:05,342 --> 01:34:06,708
Well?

1140
01:34:06,883 --> 01:34:09,208
Don't know. A reflex.

1141
01:34:26,050 --> 01:34:27,708
How did it go?

1142
01:34:27,883 --> 01:34:30,125
- Cleopatra got the message. - Great.

1143
01:34:30,175 --> 01:34:32,750
The magic potion took this long to wear off?

1144
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,875
Well, it's like this...

1145
01:34:36,175 --> 01:34:40,792
You had a taste of the best magic potion there is.

1146
01:34:42,467 --> 01:34:45,042
Good. Come, my dog.

1147
01:34:47,717 --> 01:34:50,792
Idefix just came back and he succeeded.

1148
01:34:50,967 --> 01:34:52,958
I was sure he could do it.

1149
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:58,208
There's a little pink...

1150
01:35:00,508 --> 01:35:02,708
Ave Caesar.

1151
01:35:02,883 --> 01:35:05,333
Somebody wishes to see Caesar.

1152
01:35:05,383 --> 01:35:07,958
- Who? - Someone.

1153
01:35:09,508 --> 01:35:11,458
I understand.

1154
01:35:16,092 --> 01:35:19,125
My queen, what a pleasant surprise.

1155
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:22,542
Enough! I rushed over here...

1156
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:26,292
without changing, when I heard about what's going on here.

1157
01:35:26,758 --> 01:35:28,125
What happened?

1158
01:35:29,008 --> 01:35:32,125
When you accept a bet you have to play fair.

1159
01:35:34,467 --> 01:35:37,083
- The Gauls may help me. - I never said...

1160
01:35:37,758 --> 01:35:39,083
If I may say something...

1161
01:35:39,258 --> 01:35:41,625
- Just one... - This is not conquered territory.

1162
01:35:45,425 --> 01:35:50,208
I demand the Romans leave the construction alone...

1163
01:35:50,258 --> 01:35:52,917
and repair all damages.

1164
01:35:53,092 --> 01:35:56,167
- But... - Silence! Immediately!

1165
01:36:05,925 --> 01:36:08,776
So what do we do now?

1166
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:12,500
What she said. We leave and repair the damages.

1167
01:36:12,550 --> 01:36:14,958
Of course, naturally.

1168
01:36:15,675 --> 01:36:18,833
I wouldn't want her to sniff her nose at me.

1169
01:36:19,717 --> 01:36:22,042
No matter how lovely it is.

1170
01:36:29,342 --> 01:36:32,208
The Romans are leaving.

1171
01:36:34,133 --> 01:36:37,292
- That's good news. - They're leaving already?

1172
01:36:37,342 --> 01:36:42,375
Incredible that each of those Romans leaves his footprint in the sand...

1173
01:36:44,217 --> 01:36:46,417
Excuse me, I couldn't help myself.

1174
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:48,458
That's alright.

1175
01:36:49,050 --> 01:36:53,625
For the first time Romans and Egyptians were working together...

1176
01:36:53,675 --> 01:36:57,708
on the construction of the palace. And just in time...

1177
01:36:57,758 --> 01:36:59,708
when the last grain of sand fell...

1178
01:37:37,592 --> 01:37:39,667
What are you going to do now, Noumerobis?

1179
01:37:39,717 --> 01:37:43,708
I still have to finish my work for Malococsis...

1180
01:37:43,758 --> 01:37:46,333
You don't have to worry about the crocodiles any longer.

1181
01:37:46,383 --> 01:37:47,958
That's why it could take a bit longer.

1182
01:37:48,008 --> 01:37:51,333
Not too long. Can't become a habit in this line of business.

1183
01:38:02,758 --> 01:38:05,708
Caesar admitted his defeat...

1184
01:38:05,883 --> 01:38:08,542
I bow to the most beautiful queen of all...

1185
01:38:08,717 --> 01:38:12,708
and to the Egyptian people that after the Ro...

1186
01:38:15,258 --> 01:38:19,625
And I bow to the Egyptians who are the greatest people of all.

1187
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:27,000
Cleopatra kept her promise to Noumerobis.

1188
01:38:27,175 --> 01:38:29,083
Let him be covered with gold!

1189
01:38:29,258 --> 01:38:32,375
That was the deal. Cover me with gold.

1190
01:38:34,883 --> 01:38:36,583
The queen gave Panoramix...

1191
01:38:36,758 --> 01:38:40,875
valuable manuscripts from her library in Alexandria.

1192
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:43,208
Your nose...

1193
01:38:43,633 --> 01:38:47,250
Your Majesty is too good, by Belenos...

1194
01:38:55,592 --> 01:38:59,042
Otis also gave the palace a modern touch.

1195
01:38:59,092 --> 01:39:00,458
What's this little chamber for?

1196
01:39:11,425 --> 01:39:13,375
It's Otis' invention.

1197
01:39:15,592 --> 01:39:17,875
It's the "no-effort".

1198
01:39:17,925 --> 01:39:20,542
We chose that name when we noticed...

1199
01:39:20,592 --> 01:39:23,750
that people can go up and down with no effort.

1200
01:39:23,925 --> 01:39:25,792
Speak for yourself.

1201
01:39:36,592 --> 01:39:40,042
Oh it tickles when it stops.

1202
01:39:45,717 --> 01:39:48,125
By Jupiter.

1203
01:39:48,258 --> 01:39:51,667
I want to explore every room of this miracle with you.

1204
01:39:51,717 --> 01:39:53,750
The palace is huge, Caesar.

1205
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:56,583
It consists of 162 rooms.

1206
01:39:56,967 --> 01:40:00,417
It could take a while.

1207
01:40:01,925 --> 01:40:04,667
What do you think Cleopatra and Sesam are doing?

1208
01:40:04,717 --> 01:40:07,667
- Caesar. - Cae-sar.

1209
01:40:08,675 --> 01:40:10,083
Nothing unpleasant.

1210
01:40:47,425 --> 01:40:50,000
As an exception to the rule...

1211
01:40:50,175 --> 01:40:53,833
the banquet, that concludes all of Asterix's adventures...

1212
01:40:54,008 --> 01:40:57,125
didn't take place in Gaul but in Egypt.

1213
01:41:03,092 --> 01:41:04,625
Those big shrimps are nice.

1214
01:41:04,675 --> 01:41:07,042
- Homarus. - Obelix.

1215
01:41:09,342 --> 01:41:12,083
And the guy says: "That's the pha-ra-O."

1216
01:41:15,592 --> 01:41:18,208
Because his name is O.

1217
01:41:21,925 --> 01:41:26,333
His name is O and comes from Phara.

1218
01:41:26,383 --> 01:41:30,417
It's O from Phara.

1219
01:41:31,550 --> 01:41:33,500
The guy's name is O.

1220
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:36,542
He says he's from Phara.

1221
01:41:36,717 --> 01:41:40,250
From Phara. Like the pharaoh.

1222
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:42,375
The boss... our boss.

1223
01:41:47,967 --> 01:41:49,583
You have a lovely moustache.

1224
01:41:49,633 --> 01:41:51,833
- Is it real? - Yes.

1225
01:41:51,883 --> 01:41:54,208
It's nothing.

1226
01:41:54,258 --> 01:41:57,292
You just let it grow.

1227
01:41:57,508 --> 01:41:59,500
Like your braids...

1228
01:41:59,842 --> 01:42:03,917
which are nicer then Obelix's.

1229
01:42:03,967 --> 01:42:07,458
Thanks. You know how to please a woman.

1230
01:42:07,508 --> 01:42:10,958
That's a local custom.

1231
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:13,125
In Gaul.

1232
01:42:57,883 --> 01:43:00,667
Good evening. Your name, please.

1233
01:43:00,842 --> 01:43:02,375
What for?

1234
01:43:02,425 --> 01:43:05,276
It's a private party. I've got a list.

1235
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:06,917
I'm Julius Caesar.

1236
01:43:09,383 --> 01:43:11,917
Sorry, impossible.

1237
01:43:13,092 --> 01:43:15,943
There must be a problem, because...

1238
01:43:15,967 --> 01:43:18,333
Excuse me. Make some room.

1239
01:43:20,675 --> 01:43:22,875
- A warm evening? - Are you alone?

1240
01:43:22,925 --> 01:43:26,708
We're with two, four, six, eight. It's crazy.

1241
01:43:26,758 --> 01:43:29,000
- Good evening. - There's a problem...

1242
01:43:29,050 --> 01:43:30,750
I have to be on that list.

1243
01:43:30,967 --> 01:43:34,708
- How do you spell your name? - C, A, E, S, A, R. Julius.

1244
01:43:35,883 --> 01:43:40,250
Cetaparis, Seinesaindenis, C+, but I can't find any...

1245
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:43,042
- C+, that's me. - Are you C+?

1246
01:43:43,092 --> 01:43:45,208
Why didn't you say so?

1247
01:43:45,258 --> 01:43:47,250
- Nice harness. - Thanks.

1248
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:50,625
- I'll see you inside. - Are you OK? Have a good time.

1249
01:43:50,675 --> 01:43:53,375
Can you look for Julius?

1250
01:43:53,550 --> 01:43:57,875
- J, U, L, I, U, S. - Sir, I'm not... I work here.

1251
01:43:57,925 --> 01:44:01,542
I don't know, but I know... There's one of my amphorae inside.

1252
01:44:01,717 --> 01:44:03,333
- With a J? - U, L, I, U, S.

1253
01:44:03,925 --> 01:44:08,250
Yes, that's right. Julius Caesar. At the queen's table.

1254
01:44:11,508 --> 01:44:13,250
Good evening.

1255
01:45:03,217 --> 01:45:07,042
Is it in Alexandria or at Alexandria?

1256
01:45:07,092 --> 01:45:10,917
Because in the south of Gaul there's a city called Avignon.

1257
01:45:10,967 --> 01:45:14,833
There's a beautiful bridge. And people say "at Avignon".

1258
01:45:18,842 --> 01:45:20,625
Are you a courtesan?

1259
01:45:20,675 --> 01:45:23,583
Yes, and I used to do other things too.

1260
01:45:23,633 --> 01:45:25,792
I can talk without moving my lips.

1261
01:45:25,842 --> 01:45:31,667
It's funny, the way... I have another one... here.

1262
01:45:34,342 --> 01:45:38,167
Every part of your face hides something beautiful.

1263
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,375
A rose out of your ear...

1264
01:45:45,342 --> 01:45:48,083
A sphinx from your nose.

1265
01:46:06,883 --> 01:46:12,125
The guy says: "That's the pharaoh."

1266
01:46:12,967 --> 01:46:15,667
O is his name.

1267
01:46:15,717 --> 01:46:18,000
And he's from Phara.

1268
01:46:18,050 --> 01:46:22,750
That's where he comes from. Where he was born.

1269
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:25,542
The pharaoh, because his name is O.

1270
01:47:56,092 --> 01:47:57,342
Help!

1271
01:47:57,367 --> 01:48:00,167
The end.
