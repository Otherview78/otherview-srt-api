1
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,574
<i>Check the audio.</i>

2
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:35,408
<i>Great.</i>

3
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:42,080
So, what are the most important
aspects of being a male model?

4
00:00:42,082 --> 00:00:44,047
I would say: look good.

5
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:46,981
Yes? And?

6
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:49,508
- Er, that's it.
- And walk!

7
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,948
Look good and walk?
But not at the same time, right?

8
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,739
- Most of the times at
the same time.
- Really? Can you do that?

9
00:00:56,741 --> 00:01:00,948
- Er, sure.
- Please show us!
Yes, yes, go ahead.

10
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,673
Whoo! Yeah!

11
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:10,948
Thank you. Next!

12
00:01:12,016 --> 00:01:14,915
Okay...
Hello, hello, hello.

13
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:18,442
What do we have here?

14
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:20,409
- Hey, there.
- What's up, man?

15
00:01:20,411 --> 00:01:23,915
So, I want to know, did
your parents support you
in being a male model?

16
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,882
All the way, right
from the start.

17
00:01:25,884 --> 00:01:29,047
- Even your father?
- Even my father, yeah. Why?

18
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:32,882
He wanted you to enter
this industry where you earn
only 1/3 of the women,

19
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,277
where you constantly have
to maneuver homosexual men

20
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:37,376
who want to sleep with you?

21
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:45,034
Hot.

22
00:01:45,246 --> 00:01:48,277
'I'm Lewis Taylor, and
I'm standing here with
my very best friend...'

23
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:50,047
- What was your name?
- Er, Carl.

24
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,376
My best friend Carl!

25
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:54,113
- How are you today, Carl?
- Yeah, good, good.

26
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:58,442
So, is this runway casting for a
grumpy brand or a smiley brand?

27
00:01:58,444 --> 00:02:00,948
Er, I don't know,
man. I don't know.

28
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,607
Well, smiley brands
are the cheap ones,

29
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:06,080
and the more expensive
the brand gets,

30
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:08,607
you start to look down
on your consumer.

31
00:02:08,609 --> 00:02:11,948
Like, if you want to be a
part of this "von oben"
one-man in-crowd,

32
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,113
you have to show us
some serious cash.

33
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:18,113
- So it's a grumpy brand, yeah?
- Congratulations! I'm so
happy for you!

34
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:21,113
And if you get the job, you will
get to wear exclusive clothing,

35
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:23,442
and look down on your consumer.

36
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:25,574
Okay, Carl. Show us some
of that grumpy look.

37
00:02:25,576 --> 00:02:28,244
- No, no...
- Yeah, let's go!

38
00:02:28,246 --> 00:02:30,310
Come on, Carl! You can do it.

39
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,574
Yes! "Don't you dare talk to me!

40
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:38,211
"I'm an Aryan 'Übermensch',
too obsessed with the
image of myself

41
00:02:38,213 --> 00:02:42,948
"to be involved with anything
that doesn't fit my stylized
image of the world."

42
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,607
Wait...

43
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:47,607
"Suddenly, I'm dressed
in something way less expensive.

44
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:49,376
"It's H&M!"

45
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,244
Everybody, come together!

46
00:02:51,246 --> 00:02:55,047
"You can too be a part of
this happy, smiling group
of mixed skin colors,

47
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:58,607
"for not that much money!
#friendship, #everyonesequal,

48
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:01,948
"#happylife,
#stopclimatechange."

49
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,948
Oh, no!
Oh! I am so sorry, darling.

50
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,948
I didn't see that it was
Balenciaga you're wearing.

51
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,948
"We are strong and tough
and unapproachable!"

52
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,047
Show me that Balenciaga look!

53
00:03:16,642 --> 00:03:19,706
Oh, I'm sorry,
I think it's back to H&M again!

54
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:23,442
"Yeah! We're just kidding.
We're so cheap, we're so happy!"

55
00:03:23,444 --> 00:03:25,442
Everybody, come closer together!

56
00:03:25,444 --> 00:03:28,541
Balenciaga is back!
Ooh, fiercer than ever!

57
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:30,277
"We are stone cold.

58
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:32,772
"Yes!
Oh, my God, get away from us!"

59
00:03:32,774 --> 00:03:34,816
H&M is here again!

60
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:36,211
Balenciaga!

61
00:03:36,213 --> 00:03:37,376
And H&M!

62
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:38,706
Balenciaga!

63
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:40,574
And H&M!

64
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:42,948
Oh, everybody,
give it up for these guys!

65
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,113
Fabulous! Fabulous, Carl!

66
00:03:53,345 --> 00:03:55,211
Here...

67
00:03:56,312 --> 00:03:57,948
- Hi.
- Hello.

68
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,080
How are you guys doing?

69
00:04:11,115 --> 00:04:14,211
- Oh, it's you?
- Yeah.

70
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,277
You can hardly tell
it's the same guy.

71
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,772
How old is
this perfume campaign?

72
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:20,739
When was it?
Er, three years ago.

73
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:24,948
- And then maybe a year after that.
- - Okay...

74
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,277
So you do castings again, then?

75
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:29,849
Yeah.

76
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:32,080
Could you do
a little walk for us?

77
00:04:32,082 --> 00:04:36,047
Er... Just quick.
No smiling. No stopping.

78
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:37,541
Yeah.

79
00:04:47,082 --> 00:04:48,739
One more time.

80
00:04:52,444 --> 00:04:53,882
Okay.

81
00:04:57,016 --> 00:04:59,179
Okay...

82
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:04,113
Today, fashion is not just about
surface. It's about the inside.

83
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:07,277
Think about a tune that you like
when you walk.

84
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,948
Look at me.

85
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,849
- Can you do that?
- Yeah, so like a rhythm?

86
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:21,739
Yeah. Go!

87
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:28,211
<i>Maybe he needs Botoxing.</i>

88
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,146
Can you relax your
Triangle of Sadness?

89
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:39,915
- It's like between
your eyebrows here.
- Okay.

90
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:42,047
A little bit more...

91
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:45,640
Okay. And open your mouth
so you look a little
bit more available.

92
00:05:47,609 --> 00:05:50,310
Okay, not that much.
A little bit less.

93
00:05:51,444 --> 00:05:53,783
Okay. Thank you very much.

94
00:05:55,543 --> 00:05:57,816
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

95
00:05:57,818 --> 00:05:59,541
Next, please!

96
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:08,310
- Hi!
- Hi.

97
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,442
<i>God, no!
They shouldn't be seated there.</i>

98
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:02,118
<i>Sorry, there's been a mistake.</i>

99
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:08,576
These seats are for someone else.
Please come with me...

100
00:07:08,784 --> 00:07:10,659
- Wait, what...
- What is it?

101
00:07:10,826 --> 00:07:13,118
- But these are our seats.
- Um, no...

102
00:07:13,284 --> 00:07:16,784
- She's on her way over!
- We need those seats now.

103
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:20,868
Just follow me,
and there are other seats for you.

104
00:07:21,034 --> 00:07:23,576
- But...
- Hurry up, they're here now.

105
00:07:23,784 --> 00:07:26,451
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go. Come on.

106
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:30,118
- Don't touch me!
- I'm sorry, but we need your seats now.

107
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:33,118
- Thank you so much!
- No worries...

108
00:07:33,993 --> 00:07:36,993
- Hello. Welcome!
- Hi! Welcome!

109
00:07:37,118 --> 00:07:40,242
Most welcome... Our apologies.

110
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:43,325
Hang on... Where's Gunilla?

111
00:07:43,534 --> 00:07:46,742
Excuse me.
We're a party of four.

112
00:07:46,868 --> 00:07:49,242
- We need one more seat.
- Attention please!

113
00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:53,659
Everybody move one seat to the right.

114
00:07:53,826 --> 00:07:57,242
One seat to the right! To the right!

115
00:07:57,492 --> 00:07:59,200
Let's go!

116
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:06,034
And now everybody moves
one seat to the right.

117
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:08,825
Great.

118
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,491
Perfect.

119
00:08:13,115 --> 00:08:15,277
- Where can I sit?
- Sorry?

120
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,607
- I don't have a seat now.
- Can you just...?
There's a seat.

121
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:21,409
Just right up there.
Yeah. Just there.

122
00:09:07,609 --> 00:09:10,277
Yaya! Yaya!

123
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:18,442
Yaya, look here.
Look here, Yaya!

124
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,113
Yaya!

125
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,574
Yaya!

126
00:09:42,884 --> 00:09:44,948
Thank you, sir.

127
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:00,673
Thank you, honey.

128
00:10:00,675 --> 00:10:03,014
That's so sweet of you.

129
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:17,409
Do you like the place?

130
00:10:17,411 --> 00:10:19,915
- A little stuffy?
- A little stuffy.

131
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,607
What?

132
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:33,915
I don't know, you looked like
you were thinking there.

133
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:35,739
No, I'm not. I'm not.

134
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:39,211
Cool.

135
00:10:40,851 --> 00:10:44,409
I can tell there's
something's wrong. Just
talk to me, what is it?

136
00:10:49,444 --> 00:10:51,113
No, it's just...

137
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:52,816
When you say...

138
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:57,310
When you say,
"Thank you, honey" like that...

139
00:10:57,312 --> 00:10:59,915
You don't really give me
an option but to pay.

140
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,915
It was just an observation.
Just something I've noticed.

141
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:11,772
- We can split the
bill if you like.
- No, no...

142
00:11:11,774 --> 00:11:15,277
- I can whip out a calculator...
- No, no, okay.

143
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,277
- How many glasses of
wine did you have?
- Oh, sure...

144
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,277
- You had, like, three more.
- That's not what I mean.

145
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,882
Yeah, I think it all evens out,
you know.

146
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:25,640
Hmm...

147
00:11:26,575 --> 00:11:29,211
Don't you remember last night?
You said you were gonna...

148
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:33,310
You said you were gonna pay
for food today.

149
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:38,915
At the end of the meal,
you said, "Thanks.
Tomorrow I'll get it."

150
00:11:41,246 --> 00:11:43,244
Sure, but then you
picked up the bill,

151
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:45,739
and I thought you wanted to pay,
so I said, "Thank you, honey."

152
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:49,816
- But it was there for
such a long time...
- I didn't see it.

153
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,376
- You didn't see it?
- I, er...

154
00:11:55,378 --> 00:11:58,080
No, I didn't. I didn't see it.

155
00:11:58,082 --> 00:12:01,541
Or I didn't notice it. We were
just having a nice dinner.

156
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:07,211
You didn't see the bill
when it got put on the table?

157
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:09,277
No, I didn't, Carl.

158
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:19,574
So the waiter came in, and
put it in the middle of
the table just there.

159
00:12:19,576 --> 00:12:22,409
- And you didn't
happen to see it?
- Oh, my God!

160
00:12:22,411 --> 00:12:26,541
What? I'm asking you
seriously now, because...

161
00:12:26,543 --> 00:12:28,014
Wow...

162
00:12:28,774 --> 00:12:30,739
What's... What's "wow"?

163
00:12:34,774 --> 00:12:37,113
What are you doing?

164
00:12:37,115 --> 00:12:40,706
No, no, no. Just don't... Wait.
Can you sit down? Sit down.

165
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:44,244
I'm just trying to figure out
what exactly I did wrong!

166
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:48,772
- Seriously?
- Calm down. Please,
just sit down.

167
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:52,574
- You're fighting over money!
- No! That's not what's...

168
00:12:52,576 --> 00:12:54,541
- That's literally
what's happening.

169
00:12:54,543 --> 00:12:56,442
- I'm just pointing
out the fact that...

170
00:12:56,444 --> 00:12:58,772
- Why are you so
obsessed with money?
- I'm not obsessed.

171
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:02,113
Can you just sit down, please?
I'm not obsessed with money.

172
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,640
It was just an
observation from yesterday.
Can you please sit down?

173
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,442
- No, no, no... What
are you doing?
- It's fine.

174
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,541
Well, you can't pay now,
that's ridiculous.

175
00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:27,080
- Don't, Carl.
- What are you doing?

176
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:29,882
- Let go.
- No, no, no... I'm
paying the bill.

177
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,541
That's not why I said it.

178
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:39,783
- Sorry.
- - Are we enjoying ourselves?

179
00:13:40,609 --> 00:13:43,673
Yes, thanks, yeah.
Yaya...

180
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:46,014
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

181
00:14:01,213 --> 00:14:03,211
Now I feel bad.

182
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:05,849
Why? I make more money than you.

183
00:14:16,609 --> 00:14:20,673
Excuse me.
Your card didn't work.

184
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:25,211
- Do you have
another one, maybe?
- Can you try it again, please?

185
00:14:25,213 --> 00:14:28,442
I tried it twice.

186
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,607
- I'm sorry, we don't accept that one.
- - Just take this one.

187
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:35,915
Carl! Just give me a second.
Just wait!

188
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,981
- Let me pay.
- Just wait!

189
00:14:42,609 --> 00:14:45,211
It's fine, you don't have
enough cash. Take that.

190
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:48,310
- You accept that one, yeah?
- Yes.

191
00:14:49,246 --> 00:14:51,080
- Thank you.
- Thanks so much.

192
00:15:21,477 --> 00:15:22,849
Thank you.

193
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:10,014
I do think it's quite crazy
how it's such a hard
thing to talk about.

194
00:16:11,148 --> 00:16:12,706
Money.

195
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:19,113
It's such a touchy subject.
Don't you think?

196
00:16:19,115 --> 00:16:22,211
Yeah, I think it's un-sexy
to talk about money.

197
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:30,772
Okay, but then why is that?

198
00:16:30,774 --> 00:16:33,508
I don't know,
it's just not sexy.

199
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,948
Well, you don't think
it's because it's so
tied to gender roles?

200
00:16:37,716 --> 00:16:41,343
Fuckin' hell, the menu
in the restaurant didn't
even have prices for you.

201
00:16:41,345 --> 00:16:43,409
That's not fair, Carl.

202
00:16:43,411 --> 00:16:47,607
- I'm always paying.
- No, no, no, let's take
you out of it here.

203
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:50,277
And just talk about
women in general.

204
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:54,915
I'm a generous person, Carl.
Ask any of my friends.

205
00:16:56,609 --> 00:16:59,146
Sure you're generous, but...

206
00:17:02,576 --> 00:17:03,948
But?

207
00:17:05,543 --> 00:17:08,816
When it comes to you and
me, we're dealing with
roles that I hate.

208
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:11,244
I don't want to be the man,
whilst you're the woman,

209
00:17:11,246 --> 00:17:13,244
I want us to be best friends.

210
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:16,376
- I don't wanna sleep with
my best friend.
- No, that's not...

211
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:19,475
You don't understand what
I'm trying to say. I mean...

212
00:17:19,477 --> 00:17:22,113
We shouldn't just slip into the
stereotypical gender-based roles

213
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:24,541
that everyone else
seems to be doing.

214
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:31,047
I want us to be equal.

215
00:17:43,213 --> 00:17:44,948
Excuse me?

216
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,915
- You have to fight.
- I'm sorry, what?

217
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:50,772
If you love her, you
have to fight for her.

218
00:17:50,774 --> 00:17:52,607
I've been there, I know.

219
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:55,607
If you don't fight,
you're gonna be her slave.

220
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:01,607
The thing is, Yaya, I like
to take you for dinner.
I enjoy paying for you.

221
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:04,607
But there comes a point
where I do feel used.

222
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,882
I use you?

223
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:09,607
Well, I'm just referring to my
feelings now, but sure, if we...

224
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:12,244
No, no. Just wait. If we go
back the last week or so,

225
00:18:12,246 --> 00:18:14,541
then, yeah, maybe
there is a point...

226
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:16,244
Are you being serious?

227
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:18,442
I got you this shirt.
I invited you for dinner.

228
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:22,113
- You're staying at my hotel.
- Well, you got this
shirt for free.

229
00:18:22,115 --> 00:18:24,376
- And actually you didn't
pay for dinner.

230
00:18:24,378 --> 00:18:26,376
- That's because my
card didn't work.

231
00:18:26,378 --> 00:18:29,607
There's a cash machine
in the lobby. I'll pay you
back every last cent...

232
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,574
It's okay.

233
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:33,442
Carl, I always intended
to pay you back.

234
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:37,706
I didn't realize you
wanted the money right
now before going to bed.

235
00:18:39,477 --> 00:18:42,343
- So your intention
was to pay me back?
- Yes.

236
00:18:43,444 --> 00:18:45,047
- Really?
- Yeah.

237
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:47,706
So why did you take
the 50-euro bill?

238
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:52,706
Once I realized you didn't have
enough cash, I paid the bill.

239
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:56,508
Instead of giving
me the 50-euro bill, you put
it back in your purse.

240
00:18:57,774 --> 00:19:00,376
What? I'm just saying
what happened, Yaya.

241
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,014
What are you...? Don't!

242
00:19:05,115 --> 00:19:07,673
What the fuck are you doing?

243
00:19:07,675 --> 00:19:10,211
Don't fucking do that to me!

244
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:13,442
Don't... fucking do
that to me, Yaya!

245
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,014
Don't do that to me!

246
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:19,014
- 'Going down.'
- Don't fucking shove
things down me!

247
00:19:19,016 --> 00:19:20,607
- You fucking child!
- Seriously...

248
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:21,849
You're behaving like
a crazy person.

249
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:23,706
Shut up!
Don't do things like that to me!

250
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,442
What the hell are you doing
with my money?

251
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:29,113
Your money? Oh, my God!
It's not about money, Yaya!

252
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:30,640
It's not about...

253
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,948
It's not about the
fucking money, Yaya!

254
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,816
- Oh!
- This is... No, it's not!

255
00:19:37,818 --> 00:19:40,640
You're not understanding the
point! It's not about the money!

256
00:19:40,642 --> 00:19:43,343
I'll give you that 50 euros!
I'll give you a 100 euros!

257
00:19:43,345 --> 00:19:45,541
- Oh, yeah?
- No! I'm serious now!

258
00:19:45,543 --> 00:19:48,343
This is not about
the fucking money! Why won't
you understand it?

259
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:50,607
Understand my point!

260
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:53,442
This is not about the money!

261
00:19:53,444 --> 00:19:57,541
- Oh, my God. Okay, okay.
- I want it to be equal, Yaya!

262
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:02,376
Thought he might
be dangerous, but he
just looked like...

263
00:20:06,818 --> 00:20:08,915
Bullshit feminist.

264
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:05,706
<i>The person
you're trying to reach...</i>

265
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:36,014
For fuck's...

266
00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:09,673
- What have you been doing?
- Trying to sleep on a chair.

267
00:22:09,675 --> 00:22:12,739
- How'd that go?
- Well, I'm back.

268
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:17,277
What have you been doing?

269
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,508
I was... walking up and down
the corridor and...

270
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:24,310
- Texting you multiple times.
- Hmm, a lot...

271
00:22:25,115 --> 00:22:27,541
- You saw them?
- Yeah.

272
00:22:32,576 --> 00:22:34,915
- This is so silly.
- Yeah.

273
00:22:37,543 --> 00:22:40,442
I'm... so good at being...

274
00:22:41,213 --> 00:22:42,739
...manipulative.

275
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:48,574
I don't know, I do it
and I don't even realize
that I'm doing it.

276
00:22:49,444 --> 00:22:51,739
- Yeah...
- I love you.

277
00:22:52,707 --> 00:22:56,706
No, but seriously, it's amazing
that you can tell me that.

278
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,783
Now you're a generous person.

279
00:23:00,411 --> 00:23:01,882
Okay.

280
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,475
Alright.

281
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:12,948
Ask me anything.

282
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,772
You sure?

283
00:23:14,774 --> 00:23:16,146
Uh-huh.

284
00:23:18,115 --> 00:23:21,772
In the restaurant,
with the bill...

285
00:23:21,774 --> 00:23:23,739
What about it?

286
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:26,915
You intentionally
didn't pick that up, right?

287
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:28,640
- Yes.
- Of course.

288
00:23:32,181 --> 00:23:34,607
Didn't that embarrass you?

289
00:23:35,576 --> 00:23:37,047
Nope.

290
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:41,113
- But you make more
money than I do.
- It's not about the money.

291
00:23:41,115 --> 00:23:43,211
And you said you
were gonna pay...

292
00:23:49,576 --> 00:23:52,772
It doesn't really matter
who makes more money.

293
00:23:52,774 --> 00:23:54,981
What is it about, then?

294
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:57,849
What if I...

295
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:00,706
...fall pregnant?

296
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:02,211
With me?

297
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:08,277
What if I fall pregnant
and I can't go on working?

298
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:11,849
I need to know that
the person I'm with intends
to take care of me.

299
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:13,948
Otherwise I'm wasting my time.

300
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,948
Yeah, I guess you're not
the kind to work in...

301
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,442
...a restaurant
or a supermarket, are you?

302
00:24:23,444 --> 00:24:25,640
No offense.

303
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,739
I'm a model, honey, the only way
for me to get out of this life

304
00:24:28,741 --> 00:24:31,882
is to become
someone's trophy wife.

305
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:36,179
So, there's nothing
else to this for you?

306
00:24:37,444 --> 00:24:38,882
Other than...

307
00:24:39,617 --> 00:24:43,607
...increasing the followers on
our Instagram, and all of that.

308
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:46,113
- It make sense, doesn't it?
- Sure.

309
00:24:46,115 --> 00:24:48,981
I like you. You like me.
It's good for business.

310
00:24:48,983 --> 00:24:50,343
Yeah.

311
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:53,211
- Nothing more?
- Uh-hmm.

312
00:24:53,213 --> 00:24:55,113
- Uh-hmm?
- Uh-hmm.

313
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,574
I'd like to put a bet on that.

314
00:25:00,609 --> 00:25:02,014
Okay.

315
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:04,849
- Deal.
- Yeah.

316
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,442
We'll see.

317
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:13,739
I'll make you love me.

318
00:25:15,148 --> 00:25:17,442
- It'll be real love as well.
- Oh, yeah?

319
00:25:17,444 --> 00:25:19,706
- Yep.
- Okay.

320
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:22,343
You'll forget about
this trophy shit.

321
00:25:22,345 --> 00:25:23,948
And you'll love me.

322
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:24,508
'The success of a
luxury cruise mainly
depends on two moments.

323
00:26:25,576 --> 00:26:29,113
'Number one: the first hours
the guests are onboard.

324
00:26:30,014 --> 00:26:33,146
'And number two: the last day
the guests are onboard.

325
00:26:33,881 --> 00:26:36,849
'And if we can impress them
on those two occasions,

326
00:26:36,851 --> 00:26:39,706
'then the cruise will probably
be a success.'

327
00:26:40,818 --> 00:26:42,772
And I don't want to hear
anybody saying,

328
00:26:42,774 --> 00:26:47,409
"We don't need to uncover
the sundeck, they all leave
after breakfast."

329
00:26:47,411 --> 00:26:51,475
No. I want full set-up
every morning.

330
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:53,047
No excuses.

331
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,146
Not even for the last hour.

332
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,113
It's always,
"Yes, sir! Yes, ma'am!"

333
00:27:01,115 --> 00:27:03,541
If there is an illegal substance
they want, or...

334
00:27:04,444 --> 00:27:06,113
...a unicorn!

335
00:27:06,115 --> 00:27:08,442
"Yes, sir! Yes, ma'am!"

336
00:27:08,444 --> 00:27:10,080
- Yes!
- Whoo!

337
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,574
Yes!

338
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,981
I know, I know what it is
to work for service.

339
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:19,574
I know all the challenges
you're facing.

340
00:27:20,576 --> 00:27:24,442
But at these times, I ask of you
to keep that chin up.

341
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:28,146
Stay strong.

342
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:30,706
And try to remind yourself...

343
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:34,816
...if everything goes well...

344
00:27:35,576 --> 00:27:38,409
...at the end of the cruise...

345
00:27:38,411 --> 00:27:40,948
- Money, money, money...
- ...you might be getting...

346
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,442
- ...a very generous tip!
- Money, money, money...

347
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:52,948
Money! Money! Money!

348
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,508
Money! Money!
Money! Money! Money!

349
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,376
- Money!
- Yes!

350
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:08,915
Alicia, who do we have onboard?

351
00:28:12,312 --> 00:28:13,739
No...

352
00:28:17,543 --> 00:28:19,915
- Housekeeping!
- No. No, thank you.

353
00:28:22,115 --> 00:28:24,739
- Do you want me
to clean the room?
- No, thanks.

354
00:28:24,741 --> 00:28:27,014
Okay, I'll come
back in 30 minutes?

355
00:28:27,016 --> 00:28:30,014
- No, you can come
back a bit later.
- Okay, one hour?

356
00:28:30,016 --> 00:28:32,442
Could you just
come back later, please?

357
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,574
Okay, I'll come back later.
Sorry, ma'am.

358
00:28:44,411 --> 00:28:46,376
Let me change.

359
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:41,640
- Hey there!
- Hey!

360
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:43,285
- Mario the red, how are you?
- Yes, all good!

361
00:29:43,535 --> 00:29:46,911
Great, guys!
Let's greet the rich!

362
00:29:53,702 --> 00:29:55,952
Make it shine man,
make it shine!

363
00:29:56,827 --> 00:29:58,202
Make it shine...

364
00:29:59,082 --> 00:30:00,948
What?

365
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,343
Nothing.

366
00:30:07,213 --> 00:30:08,948
- Hey!
- Hey.

367
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:18,014
- What are you doing?
- What?

368
00:30:20,213 --> 00:30:23,047
- Are you talking to the crew?
- Yeah...

369
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:27,706
- Why are you
talking to the crew?
- I said hello.

370
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:30,113
Yeah, you smiled at him
and said hello.

371
00:30:31,115 --> 00:30:33,179
- So?
- Ah...

372
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:47,541
Seriously, Yaya, we're sitting
here together, you shouldn't...

373
00:30:47,543 --> 00:30:50,211
- You just don't do that.
- Do what?

374
00:30:51,444 --> 00:30:55,948
If I started smiling
at the hot stewardess and...

375
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,014
- You know...
- You think she's hot?

376
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:04,277
No, but if she was,
and I started smiling at her,

377
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,849
and giggling and saying,
"Hey," like you did,

378
00:31:06,851 --> 00:31:08,915
then you wouldn't
like it, would you?

379
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:11,772
- Are you jealous?
- No.

380
00:31:11,774 --> 00:31:14,706
- No?
- No, I'm not. I'm not.
It's just like...

381
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,607
I mean, come on, look at you.
And then...

382
00:31:19,308 --> 00:31:22,277
And then a hot guy turns up.
I mean, he shouldn't be...

383
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:24,179
Do you think he's hot?

384
00:31:25,181 --> 00:31:26,673
He's alright.

385
00:31:28,312 --> 00:31:30,047
- Do you?
- Yeah!

386
00:31:30,882 --> 00:31:34,113
- What the fuck, man?
- You just said you thought
he was hot!

387
00:31:34,115 --> 00:31:38,244
But come on, you don't
have to... You said it
very quickly. Jesus!

388
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:41,948
Drop it, okay?

389
00:32:33,378 --> 00:32:35,508
Can I help you, sir?

390
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,574
- Sorry, just quickly...
- Yes?

391
00:32:37,576 --> 00:32:40,739
I was on the rear deck, and one
of your crew members was...

392
00:32:40,741 --> 00:32:42,442
- ...bare-chested.
- Really?

393
00:32:42,444 --> 00:32:44,277
Yeah, and like
smoking and stuff.

394
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:46,409
Oh, I'm so sorry.
That's so inappropriate.

395
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:49,244
- Yeah, it did feel
a little bit...
- No, of course.

396
00:32:49,246 --> 00:32:51,113
I'll take care of
that. I'm so sorry.

397
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:53,772
- Maybe it's not a big issue...
- No, but it's not
acceptable here.

398
00:32:53,774 --> 00:32:56,948
I thought I'd just let you know,
cos... Yeah, I didn't
wanna make anything of it.

399
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,113
Well, thank you so much.
It won't happen again, sir.

400
00:32:59,115 --> 00:33:01,179
- I promise you that.
- Alright, thanks.

401
00:33:02,115 --> 00:33:03,948
- Alicia?
- Yeah?

402
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:07,080
There's a crew member
up on deck with no shirt on.

403
00:33:07,082 --> 00:33:08,475
- No shirt on?
- Yes.

404
00:33:18,444 --> 00:33:20,343
Sorry. Just, er...

405
00:33:20,345 --> 00:33:21,607
Yes?

406
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:25,640
Is it possible to look
at the engagement rings?

407
00:33:25,642 --> 00:33:28,343
- Yes. Yes, of course!
- Is that alright?

408
00:33:28,345 --> 00:33:31,772
Definitely, yes. Okay.

409
00:33:31,774 --> 00:33:35,409
This is a beautiful ring.
This is 24-carat gold.

410
00:33:35,411 --> 00:33:37,882
And we have a point nine
diamond in the middle,

411
00:33:37,884 --> 00:33:41,673
and we have four brilliants
on every side of the band.

412
00:33:41,675 --> 00:33:45,080
- It's a very beautiful ring.
- Yes. It's really nice.

413
00:33:45,082 --> 00:33:47,915
Do you want me to try it on
so you can see it on a hand?

414
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:49,442
- Oh, okay, yeah.
- Yeah?

415
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,673
- If you don't mind?
- No, of course.

416
00:33:55,049 --> 00:33:56,310
Hmm...

417
00:34:01,312 --> 00:34:02,915
Yeah?

418
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:05,981
It's a very nice diamond, this
one. It's a flawless diamond.

419
00:34:07,016 --> 00:34:09,376
What was the price of that one?

420
00:34:09,378 --> 00:34:12,574
This one is... 28,000 euros.

421
00:34:15,708 --> 00:34:17,211
Mm-hmm...

422
00:34:23,477 --> 00:34:26,475
'Can we get an
almond latte to foredeck?'

423
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,310
Captain?

424
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:47,772
Uh, yes?

425
00:34:47,774 --> 00:34:51,409
I just wanted to tell you
it's time for the safety drill.

426
00:34:51,411 --> 00:34:53,442
Uh, well, no, I'm...

427
00:34:53,444 --> 00:34:55,673
I'm just not feeling well.

428
00:34:56,884 --> 00:35:00,442
- Should I get the doctor?
- No, no, I'll be fine.

429
00:35:00,444 --> 00:35:03,816
Just have the First take
care of it, and then...

430
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:06,640
...you know, I'll see you later.

431
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:10,080
Okay!

432
00:35:10,082 --> 00:35:11,849
- Okay.
- Okay.

433
00:35:15,378 --> 00:35:18,574
Abigail? Could you get the tray?
Thank you.

434
00:35:26,576 --> 00:35:29,772
Honey, Nutella.

435
00:35:29,774 --> 00:35:31,179
Hm-mm...

436
00:35:32,082 --> 00:35:33,783
Another one?

437
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:41,541
Have a little look.

438
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:47,948
- Aren't you going to eat the pasta?
- Sorry?

439
00:35:49,543 --> 00:35:52,706
Aren't you going
to eat the pasta?

440
00:35:54,213 --> 00:35:57,475
Oh, er...
No. I'm gluten intolerant.

441
00:35:57,477 --> 00:35:58,816
Oh?

442
00:35:58,818 --> 00:36:02,179
It's just for the pictures.
She's an influencer.

443
00:36:02,181 --> 00:36:04,113
- Oh!
- Okay.

444
00:36:04,115 --> 00:36:05,574
Wow!

445
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,113
You make money from that?

446
00:36:09,115 --> 00:36:13,211
- Champagne, sir?
- Nah... White wine.

447
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:17,211
- Sorry, what?
- Yeah... It depends.

448
00:36:17,213 --> 00:36:21,277
It depends. You mostly get
free stuff, to be honest.

449
00:36:22,115 --> 00:36:24,244
We got this cruise for free.

450
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:30,211
Good! Her looks paid for
the tickets. Not bad, huh?

451
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:35,277
- Good, huh?
- I guess so, yeah. It did.

452
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:37,849
- A lovely couple, huh?
- Yeah, that's nice.

453
00:36:37,851 --> 00:36:40,948
- Not bad, not bad.
- Thank you.

454
00:36:43,312 --> 00:36:45,607
So, what do you do?

455
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:48,948
I sell shit.

456
00:36:50,016 --> 00:36:52,310
- What, sorry?
- I sell shit!

457
00:36:54,444 --> 00:36:58,981
- Fertilizer
for agriculture.
- Oh, fertilizer...

458
00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:02,948
- Interesting.
- In every business it's
the right place...

459
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:06,080
...in the right moment.
My right place: east Europe.

460
00:37:06,082 --> 00:37:09,849
Right moment: end of 80s,
beginning of 90s.

461
00:37:09,851 --> 00:37:11,376
And, er...

462
00:37:11,378 --> 00:37:14,211
So, business start, yeah?

463
00:37:14,213 --> 00:37:17,673
- In 80s, I was...
- Baby? Can I have this one?

464
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:19,409
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

465
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:21,113
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

466
00:37:21,115 --> 00:37:22,706
- Yeah.
- Love you.

467
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:26,475
Yeah, yeah...
So, in the beginning of 80s,

468
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:29,409
I was only CEO

469
00:37:29,411 --> 00:37:33,739
in one agriculture "Kombinat",
we called it.

470
00:37:33,741 --> 00:37:37,948
Hundred thousand pigs,
two million chickens.

471
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,915
And we're getting
some kind of monopoly.

472
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:44,849
You can call me the
King of the Shit!

473
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:47,343
- It was...
- I love him. I love him!

474
00:37:47,345 --> 00:37:49,409
And when you have money,
you know,

475
00:37:49,411 --> 00:37:52,772
you don't leave money to sleep,
you understand?

476
00:37:52,774 --> 00:37:55,475
- Money must not
sleep, you know.
- Okay.

477
00:37:55,477 --> 00:37:59,442
So you put this money
from this business,

478
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:03,816
because factories
shutting down...

479
00:38:05,774 --> 00:38:08,343
And the
desert is tiramisu.

480
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,706
Or panna cotta, you
like both of those.

481
00:38:14,411 --> 00:38:17,816
- Oh... you choose.
- A-ha...

482
00:38:18,917 --> 00:38:21,607
You have the panna cotta,
I'll have a tiramisu.

483
00:38:21,609 --> 00:38:23,080
Fine.

484
00:38:27,411 --> 00:38:28,816
Hello!

485
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,376
Cheers.

486
00:38:39,675 --> 00:38:44,541
I'm Clementine.
And this is my husband, Winston.

487
00:38:44,543 --> 00:38:46,607
We're from Great Britain.

488
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:02,948
My name is Clementine.

489
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:02,911
Nein, nein...

490
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,080
- And this is
my husband, Winston.
- Winston.

491
00:39:05,082 --> 00:39:06,948
We're from Great Britain.

492
00:39:06,536 --> 00:39:07,578
Nein.

493
00:39:08,578 --> 00:39:11,036
Uli, in den Wolken.

494
00:39:10,774 --> 00:39:13,981
Hello. This is
my wife, Therese.

495
00:39:13,983 --> 00:39:17,508
She understands you perfectly,
but my wife had a stroke.

496
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:20,948
Since then, she's suffering
from a disability of speaking.

497
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:23,607
In den Wolken.

498
00:39:24,578 --> 00:39:25,911
Ja.

499
00:39:26,161 --> 00:39:27,870
Shall I take it away?

500
00:39:31,016 --> 00:39:32,607
"In den... In den..."

501
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,244
In den Wolken.

502
00:39:34,494 --> 00:39:35,703
In den Wolken!

503
00:39:35,675 --> 00:39:38,113
In den Wol...?

504
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:41,409
- Wolken.
- Wo...

505
00:39:41,411 --> 00:39:43,244
- Champagne, sir?
- No, thank you.

506
00:39:43,246 --> 00:39:46,574
- What does it mean?
- "Up in the clouds."

507
00:39:46,576 --> 00:39:48,607
Oh! How beautiful.

508
00:39:56,115 --> 00:39:58,244
- Bye, girls.
- Bye.

509
00:39:58,246 --> 00:39:59,739
Take care.

510
00:40:02,543 --> 00:40:06,541
Nice to meet you, my friend.
I hope I work with you again.

511
00:40:06,543 --> 00:40:08,607
It was a pleasure, Mario.

512
00:40:10,246 --> 00:40:12,343
- We're going to miss you.
- Miss you already.

513
00:40:12,345 --> 00:40:14,409
- Take care.
- Take care, you.

514
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:56,211
Look at that.

515
00:40:58,444 --> 00:41:00,310
Sad, huh?

516
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,915
He's hunting.

517
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:08,179
- Huh?
- He's hunting!

518
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,343
Big dilemma.

519
00:41:12,444 --> 00:41:15,783
Should he take risk,
or go to the room, huh?

520
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:20,706
Come on.

521
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,706
Look, look!

522
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:28,574
Maybe has a little chance!

523
00:41:52,378 --> 00:41:54,113
Amazing...

524
00:41:57,279 --> 00:41:58,783
Wow.

525
00:42:01,181 --> 00:42:03,607
Sorry if I'm interrupting.

526
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:06,409
Er... could you
just do me a favor?

527
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:10,211
I have this girl,
who should be here with me,

528
00:42:10,213 --> 00:42:13,113
but couldn't come and...

529
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:16,211
...I would like to take
a picture. Please.

530
00:42:17,279 --> 00:42:20,211
- Can you take my picture?
- Oh, yeah, of course.

531
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:23,739
I'll stand over here.

532
00:42:25,115 --> 00:42:26,915
Oh! Sorry, sorry!

533
00:42:36,917 --> 00:42:38,508
Good?

534
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:41,948
- Thank you very much.
- A pleasure...

535
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,574
- Have a nice evening.
- Yeah, you, too.

536
00:42:49,543 --> 00:42:51,706
Excuse me? Mister?

537
00:42:52,576 --> 00:42:56,244
Hi! Eh...
Can you please come back?

538
00:42:58,851 --> 00:43:00,882
You can leave your
beer, it's okay.

539
00:43:00,884 --> 00:43:03,508
- What?
- You can leave your beer.

540
00:43:06,609 --> 00:43:08,849
- If you come in the middle...
- Yeah?

541
00:43:08,851 --> 00:43:10,882
Then we can take a picture
together, the three of us.

542
00:43:10,884 --> 00:43:13,277
Okay, nice! Nice!

543
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,047
Yeah!

544
00:43:15,049 --> 00:43:17,113
- Now we're talking!
- Yeah!

545
00:43:19,774 --> 00:43:22,607
More boobs, Yaya!
More boobs!

546
00:43:22,609 --> 00:43:24,376
Oh...

547
00:43:25,576 --> 00:43:29,244
Thank you very much!
You're very generous!

548
00:43:30,444 --> 00:43:33,211
I would like to do something
generous to you.

549
00:43:33,213 --> 00:43:35,277
They have Rolex watches
in the reception.

550
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,772
We can go down there now, and
I will buy you Rolex watches!

551
00:43:37,774 --> 00:43:40,277
- No, it's okay. Thank you.
- No! I would like...

552
00:43:40,279 --> 00:43:42,607
It may sound strange, but I'm...

553
00:43:42,609 --> 00:43:46,442
What you just did here,
it meant so much to me.

554
00:43:46,444 --> 00:43:48,574
So I can...

555
00:43:48,576 --> 00:43:50,409
I'm very rich.

556
00:43:50,411 --> 00:43:53,948
Yes, let's not beat around
the bush. I'm very rich.

557
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:55,849
- How rich are you?
- Oh, I'm so...

558
00:43:55,851 --> 00:43:59,772
I'm so fucking rich!
I just sold my company.

559
00:43:59,774 --> 00:44:03,948
Yeah, I'm not drunk! I
told you, I'm not feeling well.

560
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:07,772
Do you have problem with that?

561
00:44:07,774 --> 00:44:10,113
Can't you respect that?

562
00:44:10,115 --> 00:44:11,948
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

563
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:14,574
- Good evening, madam.
- Good evening.

564
00:44:15,109 --> 00:44:17,739
Are you
still there, Paula?

565
00:44:22,444 --> 00:44:24,739
- Thomas?
- What is it?

566
00:44:24,741 --> 00:44:30,113
I just want to ask you when
you're able to hold the
Captain's Dinner?

567
00:44:30,115 --> 00:44:32,915
Oh, for fuck's sake...

568
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:35,179
- I can't do the
Captain's Dinner now!

569
00:44:35,181 --> 00:44:36,948
- No, I'm asking you a question,
Thomas.

570
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:40,783
When are you able to put
on your uniform and be
there for the guests?

571
00:44:41,484 --> 00:44:46,948
Oh... Okay.
Well, what's the forecast?

572
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:50,409
The weather's fine, Thomas.
It's about when you can do it.

573
00:44:51,246 --> 00:44:53,409
Any day but Thursday.

574
00:44:53,411 --> 00:44:56,607
- Thurs... Thursday's good.
- No. Thomas.

575
00:44:56,609 --> 00:44:58,376
- Thursday's bad.
- Huh?

576
00:44:58,378 --> 00:45:01,310
We have a low-pressure zone
moving in. Any day but Thursday.

577
00:45:01,312 --> 00:45:04,849
- Yes, Thursday! Okay!
- Okay, Thomas, listen.

578
00:45:04,851 --> 00:45:06,772
I'll come back and talk to you
about this later.

579
00:45:06,774 --> 00:45:10,211
Paula! Every day,
they eat dinner.

580
00:45:10,213 --> 00:45:15,047
And they're going to eat dinner
Thursday as well. Right?

581
00:45:15,049 --> 00:45:18,882
Your most expensive champagne,
and three glasses.

582
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:20,981
- Is this your boyfriends?
- Yeah.

583
00:45:21,782 --> 00:45:25,146
Guys, you take care
of these girls now!

584
00:45:26,708 --> 00:45:30,772
They're really, really nice
girls! Generous. Caring.

585
00:45:30,774 --> 00:45:33,014
You treat them right, you know!

586
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:36,211
You think they want
some champagne?

587
00:45:36,213 --> 00:45:38,981
Okay, five glasses!
Five glasses.

588
00:45:47,049 --> 00:45:48,882
Ludmilla...

589
00:45:48,884 --> 00:45:51,475
- I love you, baby!
- Yeah, yeah...

590
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:57,047
Dance with me!

591
00:45:57,049 --> 00:46:00,541
- I'm terrible at dancing.
- What if I go?

592
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:03,442
- Come on, dance with me!
- No, no...

593
00:46:03,444 --> 00:46:05,541
Come on! Just a little bit.

594
00:46:06,741 --> 00:46:09,772
- No, I'm... I'm so...
- Come on. Don't be shy!

595
00:46:09,774 --> 00:46:11,607
- No...
- Why? I'm dancing.

596
00:46:11,609 --> 00:46:15,277
- No... I never dance.
- Come on, dance with me.

597
00:46:15,279 --> 00:46:16,739
- I just don't.
- Why not?

598
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:19,915
- I don't like it.
- Okay.

599
00:46:19,917 --> 00:46:23,541
- I feel embarrassed.
- Alright, it's okay.
Whatever...

600
00:47:06,213 --> 00:47:07,541
Carl?

601
00:47:09,708 --> 00:47:12,376
Carl? Are you jealous?

602
00:47:14,148 --> 00:47:17,179
Hey! Carl?

603
00:47:20,609 --> 00:47:23,409
- Who's Carl?
- What?

604
00:47:27,279 --> 00:47:30,541
- You're not Carl?
- No, no. I'm the pool guy.

605
00:47:30,543 --> 00:47:32,244
Ooh...

606
00:47:37,543 --> 00:47:41,244
Sorry about coming
into the mansion, I just
needed to get some tools.

607
00:47:41,246 --> 00:47:42,948
Oh?

608
00:47:47,279 --> 00:47:49,277
Over here...

609
00:47:52,246 --> 00:47:54,948
It's very inappropriate.

610
00:47:58,049 --> 00:47:59,706
What if my, er...

611
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:02,915
...husband comes home?

612
00:48:02,917 --> 00:48:04,607
Where is your husband?

613
00:48:04,609 --> 00:48:08,047
He really shouldn't
be leaving such a beautiful
girl on her own.

614
00:48:08,049 --> 00:48:10,882
Because it's very dangerous
around here.

615
00:48:14,444 --> 00:48:16,739
- He's working.
- Oh...

616
00:48:17,741 --> 00:48:19,981
- Always working...
- Is he?

617
00:48:19,983 --> 00:48:22,673
Yeah.
It's hot, huh?

618
00:48:22,675 --> 00:48:24,981
- Yeah, I'm very hot.
- You should take that off.

619
00:48:24,983 --> 00:48:27,915
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Ooh.

620
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:30,179
Ooh!

621
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:38,849
The thing is, your husband pays
me a lot of money, you see.

622
00:48:38,851 --> 00:48:44,113
So, I do have to just make sure
I'm doing my job properly.

623
00:48:44,115 --> 00:48:46,442
- Okay?
- You check the pipes.

624
00:48:46,444 --> 00:48:48,310
Yeah, is there any...

625
00:48:48,945 --> 00:48:51,706
...is there any down here
that need to be...

626
00:48:53,115 --> 00:48:57,244
...unblocked, or...
is everything okay?

627
00:49:00,576 --> 00:49:02,673
You're sure you're the right guy
for the job?

628
00:49:02,675 --> 00:49:05,607
I am, I am. I'm very qualified.

629
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,882
Hmm... Let me see.

630
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,574
Do you know what
people regret on their deathbed?

631
00:49:41,576 --> 00:49:43,244
Can you turn the phone?

632
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:44,849
- No.
- No?

633
00:49:44,851 --> 00:49:48,113
That they were working too much,
seven out of ten people regret

634
00:49:48,115 --> 00:49:52,409
throwing away their lives
on stupid and pointless jobs.

635
00:49:53,675 --> 00:49:55,146
- Can I get you
anything to drink?

636
00:49:55,286 --> 00:49:57,870
<i>More champagne, please.</i>

637
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:02,574
I don't know, I was
just born into this life.
It was not my fault.

638
00:50:02,576 --> 00:50:07,277
And when this happened, I...
I just felt like, "Why? Why?"

639
00:50:07,279 --> 00:50:10,739
- Life is so unfair.
- Yeah.

640
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:13,310
We are all equal.

641
00:50:13,312 --> 00:50:16,244
- That is so true.
- Everyone's equal.

642
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:28,409
Is there anything you wish for?

643
00:50:29,675 --> 00:50:34,211
- Sorry?
- Is there anything
you... wish for?

644
00:50:35,411 --> 00:50:38,574
Well... Well, I don't know.

645
00:50:40,576 --> 00:50:43,442
That's so sweet of you, madam,
but I'm perfectly fine.

646
00:50:43,444 --> 00:50:48,574
But, but, but, but if today
was your last day alive...

647
00:50:49,884 --> 00:50:53,849
- ...hmm... what would
you wish for?
- I have no idea.

648
00:50:55,213 --> 00:50:59,277
- Have you been
for a swim today?
- No, not today.

649
00:51:00,113 --> 00:51:03,508
Why don't you go for a swim
right now?

650
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:08,816
Because this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

651
00:51:08,818 --> 00:51:12,409
That's so kind of you,
madam, but unfortunately
we're not allowed

652
00:51:12,411 --> 00:51:15,310
to go for a swim
during working hours, so...

653
00:51:15,312 --> 00:51:17,948
I want all the staff
to go for a swim!

654
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:21,080
I want you all to go for a swim!

655
00:51:21,082 --> 00:51:26,343
I really feel that I've had
one of these moments.

656
00:51:26,345 --> 00:51:30,442
Yeah, well, today might be
a little bit problematic...

657
00:51:30,444 --> 00:51:31,739
Problematic?

658
00:51:31,741 --> 00:51:33,673
Cos today we have
the Captain's Dinner.

659
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:37,948
Who cares about the
Captain's Dinner? This will
only take half an hour.

660
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:39,948
Come on, now.

661
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:42,310
You work too hard, come on.

662
00:51:43,708 --> 00:51:47,211
- Yeah, well, let me
see what I can do.
<i>- Merci!</i>

663
00:51:57,378 --> 00:52:00,706
No, no, no! Come back!
Come back, please.

664
00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:04,310
Please come back.
I have a better idea.

665
00:52:05,115 --> 00:52:07,211
- Sit down.
- Okay.

666
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:11,607
Let's reverse roles.

667
00:52:11,609 --> 00:52:14,882
- Sorry?
- Just change roles.

668
00:52:16,609 --> 00:52:21,047
You... chillax in the jacuzzi,
and I'll get the captain.

669
00:52:21,049 --> 00:52:22,574
Oh... well...

670
00:52:22,576 --> 00:52:26,541
Come on! Just be in the moment,
like I was. Please!

671
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:29,047
- Yeah, but...
- Come, come, I know
you want to.

672
00:52:29,049 --> 00:52:31,277
- Come on!
- Yes, I do but...

673
00:52:31,279 --> 00:52:33,541
But there might be
a problem for me, if I...

674
00:52:33,543 --> 00:52:36,475
Now I have to be the authority.

675
00:52:36,477 --> 00:52:39,277
- Yeah, well, I have
my clothes on...
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!

676
00:52:39,279 --> 00:52:40,915
Shut up! Now!

677
00:52:43,016 --> 00:52:46,673
I command you,
enjoy the moment!

678
00:52:49,774 --> 00:52:52,211
- N-now?
- Please.

679
00:52:56,851 --> 00:52:58,508
- No.
- No?

680
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:00,541
- No.
- What?

681
00:53:01,477 --> 00:53:03,442
- You say "no" to me?
- No. No!

682
00:53:03,444 --> 00:53:05,113
- So it's "yes"?
- Yes... No.

683
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:07,607
- "Yes" or "no"?
- I'm saying...

684
00:53:08,774 --> 00:53:10,739
Sorry, I'm saying, n...

685
00:53:11,444 --> 00:53:12,882
I'm saying...

686
00:53:13,818 --> 00:53:17,442
- Yes.
- Yes! Ha-ha!

687
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:20,607
Don't worry.
Dimitrios will buy the yacht.

688
00:53:20,609 --> 00:53:22,772
Come on! Sit down, sit down.

689
00:53:22,774 --> 00:53:25,948
- Okay, I'm going in.
- Quick, quick, quick... Yes!

690
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:31,537
Come on over!
A glass of champagne for...

691
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:33,541
- This wonderful Miss...
- Alicia.

692
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:36,370
Alicia!
Mademoiselle Alicia!

693
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,037
A glass of champagne!

694
00:53:44,609 --> 00:53:47,310
Darius? I
need your help.

695
00:53:47,312 --> 00:53:51,442
I need you tell one of
the guests that the crew
can't go for a swim.

696
00:53:51,444 --> 00:53:52,981
Why?

697
00:53:52,983 --> 00:53:55,047
Well, I told them it's not
possible because of the dinner,

698
00:53:55,049 --> 00:53:58,014
but they want to hear it
from the captain in person.

699
00:53:58,016 --> 00:54:00,739
So I went to Thomas' cabin,
I knocked on it, he's not there.

700
00:54:00,741 --> 00:54:03,541
He's not responding.
I can't get a hold of him, so...

701
00:54:03,543 --> 00:54:05,739
Could you just please go and
tell them it's not possible?

702
00:54:05,741 --> 00:54:09,014
- That would be a big help.
- Can't you just go for a swim?

703
00:54:09,016 --> 00:54:11,277
No. I mean,
that would be the easiest,

704
00:54:11,279 --> 00:54:14,244
but they want us to go
from the water slide and...

705
00:54:14,246 --> 00:54:17,409
It's not even funny.
Why are you laughing, Erik?

706
00:54:17,411 --> 00:54:19,849
- Why are you even here?
- I'm on my break.

707
00:54:19,851 --> 00:54:22,574
Well, your break is over.
Go back to work.

708
00:54:22,576 --> 00:54:26,211
It's not even installed yet,
it will take forever, and
I don't have that time.

709
00:54:26,213 --> 00:54:29,277
The chef has started the dinner,
I need the prep-time.

710
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:31,113
So please go and tell them
it's not possible...

711
00:54:31,115 --> 00:54:33,541
I'm not going to go and talk
to some crazy Russians.

712
00:54:33,543 --> 00:54:36,080
It's not crazy Russians,
it's very rich Russians.

713
00:54:36,082 --> 00:54:37,277
Same thing.

714
00:54:37,279 --> 00:54:39,442
Go and solve this problem first,
and then...

715
00:54:39,444 --> 00:54:41,915
No! We're done.

716
00:54:41,917 --> 00:54:45,948
- Why won't you do this?
- Go and take a swim. Jesus...

717
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,772
- Hello, sir!
- Hello.

718
00:54:47,774 --> 00:54:51,508
- Can I help you?
- I was just looking.

719
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:53,739
- You want to see the bridge?
- If possible.

720
00:54:53,741 --> 00:54:57,739
Of course. I can get the
First Officer. He's not doing
anything right now.

721
00:54:58,607 --> 00:55:01,113
- Could you show the
guest the bridge?
- Yes, of course.

722
00:55:01,115 --> 00:55:02,948
Welcome to the bridge.

723
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:06,244
I'm Darius. Nice to meet you.

724
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:20,310
Thomas?

725
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:25,640
Thomas? Hello?

726
00:55:32,675 --> 00:55:35,179
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

727
00:55:35,181 --> 00:55:40,409
- Actually... I have a question.
- Yes, of course.

728
00:55:40,411 --> 00:55:43,607
Yesterday, I was
up on the sundeck.

729
00:55:43,609 --> 00:55:46,739
And the sun was shining,
everything was perfect.

730
00:55:46,741 --> 00:55:49,113
But then I looked at the sails.

731
00:55:49,115 --> 00:55:51,080
- The sails?
- Yes.

732
00:55:51,082 --> 00:55:53,739
And they were... a bit dirty.

733
00:55:53,741 --> 00:55:56,113
- Oh!
- Yeah.

734
00:55:56,115 --> 00:55:57,948
- Oh...
- Yeah.

735
00:56:05,148 --> 00:56:06,706
Hello?

736
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:08,981
Hi.

737
00:56:12,741 --> 00:56:16,816
Yeah, but do you
realize the food down
here is going to be bad?

738
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:19,783
Okay, bye.

739
00:56:20,518 --> 00:56:23,574
Okay, guys, listen up.
You are going to swim.

740
00:56:23,576 --> 00:56:26,343
So, bring your swimming pants,
and go to the main deck

741
00:56:26,345 --> 00:56:28,772
as quick as possible, okay?

742
00:56:28,774 --> 00:56:32,948
Come on! Chop, chop!
You're going to water slide.

743
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:34,640
Have fun!

744
00:56:37,444 --> 00:56:39,343
Friends! Friends!

745
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:42,370
Please come out!
Friends!

746
00:56:42,537 --> 00:56:44,745
Hey, what are you still doing here?

747
00:56:44,871 --> 00:56:46,871
Put on your swimsuits right away.
We're going swimming.

748
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:49,203
- When?
- Now! Now!

749
00:56:50,245 --> 00:56:51,079
Outside!

750
00:56:51,871 --> 00:56:55,537
Put on your swimming trunks.
We are going to the "beach".

751
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:56,996
- What?
- We're going swimming.

752
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:58,996
Go, go!
Okay, we'll put on our trunks.

753
00:56:59,079 --> 00:57:00,079
Okay, friend.

754
00:57:16,741 --> 00:57:18,179
Thomas?

755
00:57:24,884 --> 00:57:26,310
Thomas?

756
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:31,948
'Good afternoon.

757
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:34,706
'I hope that everyone
has had a great day so far,

758
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:38,508
'and that you're looking forward
to the Captain's Dinner tonight.

759
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:42,882
'We would like to inform
you that we have a slight
change in the schedule.

760
00:57:42,884 --> 00:57:46,014
'The Captain's Dinner
will be held at 8:30,

761
00:57:46,016 --> 00:57:49,277
'and not at 8:00,
as it says on the daily program.

762
00:57:49,279 --> 00:57:53,343
'I repeat: the Captain's Dinner
will be held at 8:30.

763
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:54,607
'Thank you.'

764
00:57:54,609 --> 00:57:56,607
Why the push?

765
00:57:56,609 --> 00:57:59,343
Cos the crew's going
for a... a swim.

766
00:58:00,045 --> 00:58:03,080
It's a request from
one of the Russians.

767
00:58:03,815 --> 00:58:08,442
- From the water slide.
- Oh, my God! This I gotta see.

768
00:58:08,444 --> 00:58:10,882
Whoa, whoa!
Do you want to change first?

769
00:58:10,884 --> 00:58:14,607
- Oh, Alessandra! How are you?
- Alicia.

770
00:58:14,609 --> 00:58:17,310
- Al...?
- Can you leave us
for a bit, please?

771
00:58:17,312 --> 00:58:19,113
Let's go inside, yeah?

772
00:58:19,115 --> 00:58:21,113
I think you need to change
if you wanna go up...

773
00:58:21,115 --> 00:58:22,882
Yeah, yeah...

774
00:58:22,884 --> 00:58:24,882
- Let's go inside and talk.
- No, no...

775
00:58:25,708 --> 00:58:27,673
Are you okay, man?

776
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:30,706
- Good.
- Yeah?

777
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:34,882
- Very good.
- We have four and
a half hours left.

778
00:58:34,884 --> 00:58:36,772
Until the Captain's Dinner.

779
00:58:36,774 --> 00:58:40,277
You chill in your room,
have little nap. I'll be
back in a couple of hours.

780
00:58:40,279 --> 00:58:42,541
And we'll... go together.

781
00:58:42,543 --> 00:58:44,607
Yeah?

782
00:58:48,049 --> 00:58:49,882
Darius...

783
00:58:49,884 --> 00:58:51,574
Look at you!

784
00:58:51,576 --> 00:58:56,640
What are you all worked
up about? I'm fine!
Just totally fine.

785
00:58:56,642 --> 00:59:00,211
- Yeah?
- Completely, a
hundred percent...

786
00:59:01,411 --> 00:59:03,442
...fine.

787
00:59:05,774 --> 00:59:07,739
- Mohammed! Mohammed!
- What?

788
00:59:07,741 --> 00:59:09,706
Come! Let's go! Come, come!

789
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:12,816
- What?
- Let's go!

790
00:59:14,378 --> 00:59:16,475
Oh! Whoo!

791
00:59:18,115 --> 00:59:19,706
Wonderful!

792
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:25,783
- Some champagne.
- Bravo!

793
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:31,343
Santé!

794
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:37,948
Are we enjoying ourselves? Yes!

795
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:19,948
If you just stand here,
and they will be coming to you.

796
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:23,475
- Okay.
- Let me see you. Okay.

797
01:00:25,378 --> 01:00:27,640
- Okay!
- Thank you, Paula.

798
01:00:27,642 --> 01:00:30,080
- Just one night, that's all.
- Okay.

799
01:00:31,182 --> 01:00:34,882
Darius, could you stand next
to him? Just to make sure...

800
01:00:40,312 --> 01:00:42,772
- Okay? You're ready?
- Thank you.

801
01:00:42,774 --> 01:00:44,310
- Yep.
- Yes.

802
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:48,244
Okay, let's get ready
to open the doors.

803
01:00:48,246 --> 01:00:50,739
Open on my signal, yes?

804
01:00:52,444 --> 01:00:54,014
And... go.

805
01:00:58,609 --> 01:01:00,113
Good evening.

806
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:02,310
- Welcome to the
Captain's Dinner.
- Thank you.

807
01:01:02,312 --> 01:01:05,343
- Would you like a
glass of champagne?
- Thank you very much.

808
01:01:05,345 --> 01:01:08,277
Good evening.
Welcome to the Captain's Dinner.

809
01:01:08,279 --> 01:01:09,915
Hi... Hi!

810
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:12,739
Good evening.
Enjoying your cruise?

811
01:01:14,082 --> 01:01:16,277
- Welcome.
- Hello, ma'am.

812
01:01:16,279 --> 01:01:18,882
Nice to meet you.
Enjoy your dinner.

813
01:01:20,609 --> 01:01:23,277
Oh, hello, ma'am. How are you?

814
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:25,277
Enjoy your dinner.

815
01:01:25,279 --> 01:01:27,739
Hope the weather's not
too rough on you.

816
01:01:29,082 --> 01:01:30,948
- Hello, sir.
- Hi.

817
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:32,475
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

818
01:01:32,477 --> 01:01:34,640
Nice to meet you.
Enjoy your dinner.

819
01:01:34,642 --> 01:01:37,244
- Hello, sir.
- Good evening.
Jarmo Björkman...

820
01:01:37,246 --> 01:01:39,640
I have a question. I'm sorry.

821
01:01:41,246 --> 01:01:44,211
- Yesterday, I was up on deck.
- Yes.

822
01:01:44,213 --> 01:01:47,882
And it was so beautiful.
Everything was fantastic.

823
01:01:47,884 --> 01:01:50,080
But then, I saw the sails.

824
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:52,640
The sails?

825
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:54,343
- The sails, yes.
- Oh...

826
01:01:54,345 --> 01:01:57,849
Yeah. And they were dirt-gray.

827
01:01:59,279 --> 01:02:01,574
Do you think it's possible
to wash them?

828
01:02:01,576 --> 01:02:05,673
Well, I don't think that's
possible, ma'am, because, er...

829
01:02:05,675 --> 01:02:09,047
- ...this is a motorized vessel.
- Yeah.

830
01:02:09,049 --> 01:02:11,442
So, we don't have any sails.

831
01:02:14,312 --> 01:02:17,047
Maybe it was the sundeck roof?

832
01:02:17,049 --> 01:02:21,882
- Well... Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

833
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,244
- Magnus!
<i>- Yes?</i>

834
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:34,704
The ship in the catalogue
had bright white sails, didn't it?

835
01:02:34,871 --> 01:02:36,746
- Yes.
- Right.

836
01:02:37,741 --> 01:02:40,080
Yes. He says yes.

837
01:02:40,082 --> 01:02:42,244
- It was sails.
- Magnus says yes.

838
01:02:42,246 --> 01:02:43,475
Yes.

839
01:02:44,444 --> 01:02:46,772
Jesus Christ...

840
01:02:46,774 --> 01:02:49,409
Well, then, in that case,

841
01:02:49,411 --> 01:02:51,739
we will clean the sails.

842
01:02:51,741 --> 01:02:54,882
- Yes.
- Of course.

843
01:02:54,884 --> 01:02:58,442
I'm sure we can find
a solution for you. I'm sure...

844
01:02:58,444 --> 01:03:00,739
- Can I escort you to a table?
- Okay.

845
01:03:00,741 --> 01:03:02,882
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Thank you.

846
01:03:02,884 --> 01:03:06,244
Well... Jarmo Björkman.
I'm sitting at your table.

847
01:03:06,246 --> 01:03:08,442
- Oh! Good, good.
- Hello, Jarmo.

848
01:03:08,444 --> 01:03:10,244
Are you also sitting
at the captain's table?

849
01:03:10,246 --> 01:03:11,376
Yes, I am.

850
01:03:11,378 --> 01:03:13,948
- Is it this one?
- Yes. Go ahead.

851
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:15,706
Oh, Lord...

852
01:03:28,115 --> 01:03:30,541
It's not so much apps as code.

853
01:03:30,543 --> 01:03:34,772
I create code for apps.
So you can program...

854
01:03:34,774 --> 01:03:40,541
So, I sell my codes and
my skills to different
tech companies.

855
01:03:41,983 --> 01:03:47,574
And then, the game makers
are pitching ideas to me.

856
01:03:47,576 --> 01:03:49,442
Sir.

857
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:55,146
So, good evening.

858
01:03:55,148 --> 01:03:57,442
For tonight's first meal,
we will be serving you

859
01:03:57,444 --> 01:04:00,607
some delicious oysters
with some black Russian caviar.

860
01:04:00,609 --> 01:04:03,508
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

861
01:04:10,049 --> 01:04:13,113
- Are we enjoying the food?
- - Yes, very much.

862
01:04:21,477 --> 01:04:24,047
So, what business
do you have together?

863
01:04:24,049 --> 01:04:26,277
Oh, it's
a family business.

864
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:29,541
Producing products
in precision engineering.

865
01:04:30,884 --> 01:04:32,706
What do you manufacture?

866
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:35,882
Well, our products have been
employed in upholding democracy

867
01:04:35,884 --> 01:04:38,146
all over the world.

868
01:04:43,741 --> 01:04:45,607
What product is that?

869
01:04:45,609 --> 01:04:49,244
Basically, our best-selling
product is the hand grenade.

870
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:52,915
Sorry, the what?

871
01:04:52,917 --> 01:04:55,211
The hand grenade, dear.

872
01:05:01,016 --> 01:05:03,882
For a long time, it was
the personal exploding device.

873
01:05:03,884 --> 01:05:08,541
But then came those
UN regulations, and
messed everything up.

874
01:05:08,543 --> 01:05:11,882
A personal exploding device...

875
01:05:11,884 --> 01:05:13,475
Excuse me.

876
01:05:13,477 --> 01:05:17,849
...is a very complicated word
for a land mine.

877
01:05:17,851 --> 01:05:20,310
Yeah...

878
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:25,772
Those regulations trimmed...
25% off on profits.

879
01:05:25,774 --> 01:05:28,607
- Yeah.
- It was hard times
for us, but...

880
01:05:29,408 --> 01:05:33,244
- We pulled together, didn't we?
- Yes, we did, darling.

881
01:05:33,246 --> 01:05:35,915
And we still love each other.

882
01:05:35,917 --> 01:05:37,816
- A toast!
- Oh, yeah.

883
01:05:38,609 --> 01:05:41,706
Er... to love!

884
01:05:43,016 --> 01:05:44,376
- To love.
- To love.

885
01:05:53,917 --> 01:05:56,179
- Sir.
- Madam.

886
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:04,607
This is our sea urchin,
with an emulsion of sea weed.

887
01:06:04,609 --> 01:06:08,607
On top, you've got black
truffle, caviar, chili oil,

888
01:06:08,609 --> 01:06:11,343
and a drizzle of
yuzu vinaigrette.

889
01:06:11,345 --> 01:06:13,211
- Enjoy!
- Thank you.

890
01:06:16,774 --> 01:06:19,310
- Hmm!
- Hmm...

891
01:06:26,444 --> 01:06:29,640
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- - Yes.

892
01:06:29,642 --> 01:06:31,607
Madam.

893
01:06:52,246 --> 01:06:53,816
Sir.

894
01:06:54,741 --> 01:06:56,574
Madam.

895
01:06:57,884 --> 01:07:00,849
- So are you feeling
a bit seasick?
- Yes, a bit.

896
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:03,113
Yes, so I think it would be
better to eat something,

897
01:07:03,115 --> 01:07:05,915
because seasickness is worse
on an empty stomach.

898
01:07:28,576 --> 01:07:29,981
Sir.

899
01:07:37,774 --> 01:07:41,772
So, now we are serving
some hamburger with french
fries for the captain.

900
01:07:41,774 --> 01:07:43,706
And for you, we have
something really special.

901
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:48,047
We have grilled and
smoked octopus along with
some caramelized lemon,

902
01:07:48,049 --> 01:07:51,475
and on top, beautiful garden
flowers. Please enjoy.

903
01:07:52,741 --> 01:07:55,146
I'm not a fan of fine dining.

904
01:07:57,950 --> 01:08:00,047
Are you okay?

905
01:08:06,609 --> 01:08:09,607
Madam? Dagueneau,
French, Sauvignon blanc?

906
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:10,663
Champignon...

907
01:08:10,829 --> 01:08:12,121
Du champagne! S'il vous plaît.

908
01:08:12,246 --> 01:08:13,673
Champagne.

909
01:08:17,950 --> 01:08:19,475
Quick!

910
01:08:24,741 --> 01:08:26,541
<i>Santé!</i>

911
01:08:27,376 --> 01:08:31,113
If you feel seasick, you should
try and eat something, ma'am.

912
01:08:31,115 --> 01:08:34,277
Oh, are you okay?

913
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:38,277
Are you
alright, sir?

914
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:41,508
Sir?

915
01:08:53,016 --> 01:08:55,080
I'm good...

916
01:08:57,950 --> 01:08:59,948
Excuse me.

917
01:08:59,950 --> 01:09:02,244
- Are you okay?
- I'm afraid not...

918
01:09:04,279 --> 01:09:06,409
How are you?

919
01:09:08,115 --> 01:09:11,442
Oh, my God! Oh!

920
01:09:11,444 --> 01:09:12,948
Please.

921
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:15,277
Oh, oh, oh, oh...

922
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:18,574
- Oh, my darling.
- More champagne...

923
01:09:19,609 --> 01:09:21,607
Maybe you should
have some water?

924
01:09:21,609 --> 01:09:23,047
Champagne.

925
01:09:23,049 --> 01:09:25,607
Champagne? You should not
drink champagne now.

926
01:09:25,609 --> 01:09:27,508
Take some water, please.

927
01:09:30,115 --> 01:09:33,179
Okay. It's helping.
She's fine. Yeah...

928
01:09:37,049 --> 01:09:41,113
Okay, the restroom.
Let's go, I've got you.

929
01:09:41,115 --> 01:09:44,113
- More wine, sir?
- - Ludmilla, don't leave me!

930
01:09:56,345 --> 01:09:58,211
You okay?

931
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:07,442
Darius?

932
01:10:08,044 --> 01:10:12,772
- He doesn't look well.
- You okay?
Feeling seasick, sir?

933
01:10:12,774 --> 01:10:15,673
Is it your chest?
Here, chest pains.

934
01:10:15,675 --> 01:10:18,047
- Grilled octopus...
- Ginger candy?

935
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:22,047
Oh, ma'am.
Thank you for tonight.

936
01:10:23,609 --> 01:10:28,146
Everybody, let's try to
keep calm. Take your seats.

937
01:10:28,148 --> 01:10:31,376
Er... the next course is going
to be wonderful.

938
01:10:31,378 --> 01:10:34,113
Ginger candy?
It's good if you're seasick.

939
01:10:34,115 --> 01:10:36,277
Ginger candy?
It's good if you're seasick.

940
01:10:37,079 --> 01:10:39,146
Stay calm, everybody,
everything is fine.

941
01:10:41,016 --> 01:10:42,607
Damn!

942
01:10:43,241 --> 01:10:47,244
Excuse us. Excuse me.
Make way, please.

943
01:10:47,246 --> 01:10:49,244
Are you okay?

944
01:10:49,246 --> 01:10:51,673
Keep moving, everything is fine.
Everything is fine.

945
01:10:51,675 --> 01:10:53,244
I'm gonna open your shirt.

946
01:10:53,246 --> 01:10:55,047
- Is it a stroke?
- I don't know.

947
01:10:55,049 --> 01:10:56,475
Everybody, stay calm!

948
01:10:56,496 --> 01:10:57,705
In den Wolken.

949
01:10:58,279 --> 01:11:01,277
Erik! Erik!
The defibrillator right now!

950
01:11:01,413 --> 01:11:02,746
In den Wolken!

951
01:11:04,213 --> 01:11:07,574
Careful! Careful!
Thank you for tonight.

952
01:11:07,576 --> 01:11:09,948
Thank you for tonight.
Thank you.

953
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:13,409
- Just clean up now.
- Take some deep
breaths for me, sir.

954
01:11:13,538 --> 01:11:17,538
<i>Start by removing all clothing
from the patient's chest...</i>

955
01:11:29,312 --> 01:11:31,277
Oh, oh!

956
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:35,772
- That's okay, madam.
- Hey... There, there.

957
01:11:35,774 --> 01:11:38,409
I'm glad the hat came in useful.

958
01:11:38,411 --> 01:11:41,849
- So sorry, darling...
- No, no. It's nothing at all.

959
01:11:49,246 --> 01:11:52,047
Ha!
Okay, here we are.

960
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:54,739
Thank you.

961
01:11:56,741 --> 01:12:01,179
I have a joke. Do you know
how to tell a communist?

962
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:05,442
It's someone
who reads Marx and Lenin.

963
01:12:05,444 --> 01:12:09,409
And do you know how to tell
an anti-communist?

964
01:12:09,411 --> 01:12:10,948
Uh-huh.

965
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:15,739
It's someone who understands
Marx and Lenin. Ha-ha!

966
01:12:15,741 --> 01:12:18,772
It's Ronald Reagan.
Funny guy!

967
01:12:18,774 --> 01:12:23,442
"Never argue with an idiot,
they'll only bring you
down to their level

968
01:12:23,444 --> 01:12:26,508
"and beat you with experience."
Mark Twain.

969
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:28,948
Oh-oh... Okay.

970
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:31,508
Ronald Reagan, he said also,

971
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:36,343
"Socialism works only in heaven
where they don't need it,

972
01:12:36,345 --> 01:12:40,409
"and in hell
where they already have it."

973
01:12:40,411 --> 01:12:43,673
- That's...
that's pretty good.
- Yeah?

974
01:12:43,675 --> 01:12:46,047
Okay. Hold on...
I've got one here.

975
01:12:46,983 --> 01:12:48,739
Oh, oh, oh, no, I have one!

976
01:12:48,741 --> 01:12:53,882
"Growth for the sake of
growth is the ideology
of a cancer cell."

977
01:12:53,884 --> 01:12:55,981
- Ah...
- That's Edward Abbey.

978
01:12:55,983 --> 01:13:00,706
Listen: "The problem with
socialism is that you eventually

979
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:03,772
"run out of other
people's money."

980
01:13:03,774 --> 01:13:07,014
- Margaret Thatcher.
- You're going to
like this one...

981
01:13:07,016 --> 01:13:12,080
"The last capitalist we
hang will be the one
who sold us the rope."

982
01:13:12,082 --> 01:13:15,640
- Karl Marx.
- Oh! Shit!

983
01:13:16,142 --> 01:13:19,409
Okay! Okay, okay, okay...

984
01:13:23,708 --> 01:13:27,376
- Sorry.
- Dear God!

985
01:13:30,411 --> 01:13:32,739
Okay. A classic.

986
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:36,277
"The most powerful single force
in the world today

987
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:41,113
"is man's eternal desire
to be free and independent."

988
01:13:41,115 --> 01:13:43,409
- Kennedy.
- Okay.

989
01:13:43,411 --> 01:13:46,915
"Freedom in capitalist society
always remains about the same

990
01:13:46,917 --> 01:13:48,882
"as it was in ancient Greece.

991
01:13:48,884 --> 01:13:51,772
"Freedom... for slave owners."

992
01:13:51,774 --> 01:13:54,014
I know. Vladimir Lenin!

993
01:13:56,115 --> 01:13:57,607
- School.
- Ah...

994
01:14:00,884 --> 01:14:04,607
A Russian capitalist,
and an American communist.

995
01:14:04,609 --> 01:14:08,310
On a $250-million luxury yacht.

996
01:14:30,378 --> 01:14:31,882
Very good!

997
01:14:32,609 --> 01:14:34,442
Drink, my friend!

998
01:14:34,444 --> 01:14:37,277
Drink, you're
supposed to drain it.

999
01:14:37,279 --> 01:14:39,376
- Come on.
- Okay.

1000
01:14:39,378 --> 01:14:40,783
Drink!

1001
01:14:41,718 --> 01:14:45,772
- Dimitry, stay focused!
Stay focused.
- Okay. Okay, okay.

1002
01:14:45,774 --> 01:14:47,706
- Drink!
- Okay.

1003
01:14:50,115 --> 01:14:52,376
- Red or black?
- Black.

1004
01:14:52,378 --> 01:14:53,739
Very good.

1005
01:14:54,609 --> 01:14:57,607
- Red or black?
- Er... black.

1006
01:14:58,312 --> 01:15:00,047
Have a drink.

1007
01:15:05,345 --> 01:15:06,706
Okay...

1008
01:15:08,444 --> 01:15:10,277
- Red or black?
- Black.

1009
01:15:10,279 --> 01:15:12,442
Very good!

1010
01:15:12,444 --> 01:15:14,607
- Red.
- Take a drink!

1011
01:15:15,774 --> 01:15:17,574
Wow...

1012
01:15:22,774 --> 01:15:24,047
Red or black?

1013
01:15:25,213 --> 01:15:27,211
Er...

1014
01:15:32,213 --> 01:15:34,541
- Red.

again. Bobby Kennedy was killed.

01:29:27,444 --> 01:29:29,277
No one else?

1181
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:31,047
You think I'm a pirate?

1182
01:29:31,049 --> 01:29:32,739
Are you okay?

1183
01:29:32,741 --> 01:29:36,080
Just because I'm black,
you think that I'm
a pirate. That's it!

1184
01:29:36,082 --> 01:29:38,211
- Ah! Okay, okay.
- Don't go there...

1185
01:29:38,213 --> 01:29:40,706
- Don't say that I'm...
- Don't go there.

1186
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:42,882
You can
cry on my shoulder!

1187
01:29:42,884 --> 01:29:46,849
He comes to me with his big
watch and says I'm a pirate
just because I'm black!

1188
01:29:46,851 --> 01:29:48,277
What's the problem
with you, man?

1189
01:29:48,279 --> 01:29:50,442
He hasn't said anything
about you being black.

1190
01:29:50,444 --> 01:29:55,277
- You're calling him a racist.
- In the eyes, I can
see it in his eyes...

1191
01:29:55,279 --> 01:29:57,739
- Who are you?
Who are you?
- Sir!

1192
01:29:57,741 --> 01:30:01,047
- I work in the engine room, man!
- - Sir!

1193
01:30:01,049 --> 01:30:03,179
- What?
- Excuse me.

1194
01:30:03,181 --> 01:30:05,442
I think you should
just calm down now.

1195
01:30:05,444 --> 01:30:08,080
It's not a good time
to step up the situation.

1196
01:30:08,082 --> 01:30:09,277
- Just stay calm and
stay positive.

1197
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:11,343
He works in
the engine room?

1198
01:30:11,345 --> 01:30:14,772
There's a lot of people on the boat.
We can't see each other all the time.

1199
01:30:14,774 --> 01:30:18,915
- So what's the problem?
- Please don't go there.

1200
01:30:18,917 --> 01:30:20,816
I'm sorry. I just
have to get that.

1201
01:30:22,246 --> 01:30:25,113
- Just say what you have to say.
- - Stop.

1202
01:30:25,115 --> 01:30:26,882
Say it to me.

1203
01:30:26,884 --> 01:30:29,244
Yes, I know.
I'll get back to you. I know.

1204
01:30:29,246 --> 01:30:31,882
Sir. Sir!

1205
01:31:16,543 --> 01:31:18,948
Oh! Ah!

1206
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:20,113
Easy, easy!

1207
01:31:34,884 --> 01:31:36,277
Oh...

1208
01:31:36,279 --> 01:31:39,277
- Ow! Ow!
- Shh, shh!

1209
01:31:41,818 --> 01:31:43,739
Be quiet.

1210
01:31:48,378 --> 01:31:51,035
Nein... nein...

1211
01:31:51,456 --> 01:31:52,622
In den Wolken!

1212
01:31:57,609 --> 01:32:00,442
No, don't
use the flares!

1213
01:32:00,444 --> 01:32:03,409
It's our last flare!
Don't use the flare!

1214
01:32:12,706 --> 01:32:17,873
Our Father, who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name...

1215
01:32:31,774 --> 01:32:33,706
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1216
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:41,040
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1217
01:32:44,497 --> 01:32:46,372
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1218
01:32:53,205 --> 01:32:56,040
<i>Nein, nein. In den Wolken!</i>

1219
01:32:58,873 --> 01:33:01,456
<i>IN DEN WOLKEN!</i>

1220
01:33:26,247 --> 01:33:29,081
My, oh my, oh my!

1221
01:33:29,082 --> 01:33:31,948
- Hey!
- What?

1222
01:33:31,950 --> 01:33:33,508
Look!

1223
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:35,146
Oh, shit...

1224
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,607
Yaya, wake up, wake up.

1225
01:33:42,444 --> 01:33:43,882
Look!

1226
01:33:56,246 --> 01:33:58,442
There's water in there.

1227
01:33:58,444 --> 01:34:00,816
- There's water in there.
- Yes!

1228
01:34:01,851 --> 01:34:04,080
- Is it closed?
- It's closed. It's closed.

1229
01:34:04,082 --> 01:34:07,442
- Paula, we need water!
- Be patient.

1230
01:34:07,444 --> 01:34:11,080
- Is somebody in there?
- Yeah, there's
someone in there.

1231
01:34:11,082 --> 01:34:13,244
Calm down, calm down.

1232
01:34:13,246 --> 01:34:15,343
- Does she have water?
- Yes.

1233
01:34:15,345 --> 01:34:19,640
Open up! Open up!

1234
01:34:19,642 --> 01:34:24,047
Open up!
Open up! Open up!

1235
01:34:25,115 --> 01:34:28,849
- It's Abigail.
Abigail! Come out!
- Ma'am Paula?

1236
01:34:28,851 --> 01:34:31,179
- Are you okay?
- What?

1237
01:34:31,181 --> 01:34:33,080
- Open the hatch!
- Water! Water!

1238
01:34:33,082 --> 01:34:35,475
- Okay!
- - Paula, we need water...

1239
01:34:37,884 --> 01:34:40,915
- Hey, ma'am Paula!
- What do you have?

1240
01:34:41,383 --> 01:34:44,277
We need all of these boxes out.
Okay?

1241
01:34:44,279 --> 01:34:47,244
So, everybody, just calm down.
We'll get water now.

1242
01:34:47,246 --> 01:34:49,113
Yes!

1243
01:34:49,115 --> 01:34:51,475
There's some chips in there as well.
So, everybody will get some.

1244
01:34:51,477 --> 01:34:53,442
- And chips?
- And chips.

1245
01:35:00,213 --> 01:35:02,816
What's she doing?

1246
01:35:02,818 --> 01:35:05,739
What are you doing?
What's taking so long? Come on.

1247
01:35:08,576 --> 01:35:11,783
Just wait a minute. Just
back up. Back up a bit.

1248
01:35:12,651 --> 01:35:15,409
And the chips, Abigail.
Come on, everything out.

1249
01:35:15,411 --> 01:35:18,080
Paula,
ask for food, yeah?

1250
01:35:21,213 --> 01:35:23,739
- And the Evian.
- Yes, ma'am Paula.

1251
01:35:26,082 --> 01:35:28,376
Thank you.
And how many are you?

1252
01:35:28,378 --> 01:35:31,948
You're five? Just be patient.
Everyone will get...

1253
01:35:32,818 --> 01:35:34,310
Here you go.

1254
01:35:35,884 --> 01:35:37,343
There you go.

1255
01:35:38,378 --> 01:35:39,981
Please save it.

1256
01:35:49,576 --> 01:35:52,915
- Are there more boxes with water?
- - No, this is it.

1257
01:35:52,917 --> 01:35:55,113
- What's this?
- It's a facial spray.

1258
01:35:55,115 --> 01:35:57,882
But you can drink it,
it's just water in a can.

1259
01:35:58,917 --> 01:36:02,179
Keep it close to your mouth,
so you won't waste it.

1260
01:36:06,609 --> 01:36:08,113
Here you go.

1261
01:36:08,781 --> 01:36:10,882
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1262
01:36:19,706 --> 01:36:22,581
<i>In den Wolken!</i>

1263
01:36:33,378 --> 01:36:34,882
Okay?

1264
01:37:11,884 --> 01:37:14,981
Bravo!

1265
01:37:14,983 --> 01:37:18,047
- Bravo!
- Whoo!

1266
01:37:19,609 --> 01:37:21,047
Crazy.

1267
01:37:25,675 --> 01:37:30,211
- Did she catch that with her hands?
- - Good job, Abigail!

1268
01:37:31,609 --> 01:37:35,607
Good job! What is
that? An octopus?

1269
01:37:35,609 --> 01:37:37,882
- Octopus.
- Good!

1270
01:37:37,884 --> 01:37:40,981
- What do you think
we should do now?
- Fucking impressive.

1271
01:37:40,983 --> 01:37:43,541
We need
to make a fire.

1272
01:37:43,543 --> 01:37:45,981
Of course we need to
make a fire.

1273
01:37:45,983 --> 01:37:47,343
Yes...

1274
01:37:49,016 --> 01:37:51,948
Do any of you know
how to make a fire?

1275
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:53,211
What?

1276
01:37:53,213 --> 01:37:57,113
Do any of you know
how to make a fire?

1277
01:38:00,181 --> 01:38:01,673
- No?
- No!

1278
01:38:02,510 --> 01:38:04,310
- What?
- No!

1279
01:38:05,378 --> 01:38:08,981
Then you'll make the fire
after you're done fishing,
and then we should...

1280
01:38:08,983 --> 01:38:12,310
- We need to clean the octopus.
- Of course we do.

1281
01:38:16,378 --> 01:38:19,948
Do any of you know
how to clean an octopus?

1282
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:24,244
- Huh?
- To clean an octopus!

1283
01:38:24,246 --> 01:38:26,310
Do you know how to do it?

1284
01:38:34,851 --> 01:38:37,047
Uh-huh...

1285
01:38:47,115 --> 01:38:49,014
One for you.

1286
01:38:49,917 --> 01:38:51,772
One for me.

1287
01:38:51,774 --> 01:38:53,310
One for you.

1288
01:38:54,016 --> 01:38:55,948
One for me.

1289
01:38:55,950 --> 01:38:57,772
One for you.

1290
01:38:57,774 --> 01:38:59,640
One for me.

1291
01:38:59,642 --> 01:39:01,442
One for you.

1292
01:39:01,444 --> 01:39:02,981
One for me.

1293
01:39:03,774 --> 01:39:04,915
One for you.

1294
01:39:05,609 --> 01:39:07,442
One for me.

1295
01:39:07,444 --> 01:39:10,816
One for you. One for me.

1296
01:39:11,246 --> 01:39:13,244
One for you.

1297
01:39:13,246 --> 01:39:14,849
For me.

1298
01:39:14,851 --> 01:39:16,915
For you. For me.

1299
01:39:16,917 --> 01:39:19,508
For you.
For me.

1300
01:39:20,950 --> 01:39:23,244
- Uh-huh!
- What?

1301
01:39:25,675 --> 01:39:27,376
What's that?

1302
01:39:29,279 --> 01:39:31,244
That's mine.

1303
01:39:31,246 --> 01:39:33,343
No, the big pile there?
What's that?

1304
01:39:33,345 --> 01:39:35,772
Mine. It's mine.

1305
01:39:35,774 --> 01:39:38,816
- All of this?
- Yes.

1306
01:39:39,751 --> 01:39:43,739
No. No, no, no...
Why do you get so much food?

1307
01:39:45,444 --> 01:39:46,706
Why?

1308
01:39:50,609 --> 01:39:52,541
I caught the fish.

1309
01:39:53,246 --> 01:39:55,442
- Yes?
- I made the fire.

1310
01:39:55,444 --> 01:39:57,310
- And?
- I cooked.

1311
01:39:57,312 --> 01:40:01,541
I did all the work.
And everybody got something.

1312
01:40:04,444 --> 01:40:05,849
Hmm...

1313
01:40:06,609 --> 01:40:09,915
No. No, we all... we all worked.

1314
01:40:09,917 --> 01:40:12,080
What did you do?

1315
01:40:12,981 --> 01:40:16,640
We... gathered all the wood
for the fire.

1316
01:40:16,642 --> 01:40:19,277
I moved the log.

1317
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:22,915
Yeah, this big log was
over there, and we
moved it over here.

1318
01:40:22,917 --> 01:40:24,574
Not enough.

1319
01:40:25,742 --> 01:40:28,948
No, maybe not enough,
but we need to work together.

1320
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:33,146
- They don't know
how to do that.
- Exactly.

1321
01:40:34,950 --> 01:40:39,047
And maybe that's why you
should not be so lazy
and dependent on me.

1322
01:40:39,049 --> 01:40:41,816
Uh-huh!

1323
01:41:00,741 --> 01:41:04,376
Abigail...
I think you're forgetting

1324
01:41:04,378 --> 01:41:08,113
that you and I are employees
of a big shipping company.

1325
01:41:08,115 --> 01:41:10,047
Remember?

1326
01:41:10,049 --> 01:41:13,607
In the end, I'm responsible
for the safety of the guests.

1327
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:15,607
You have to do what I say.

1328
01:41:16,675 --> 01:41:20,376
We work on a yacht.
You are a toilet manager.

1329
01:41:20,378 --> 01:41:23,244
- You don't know
how to handle...
- What yacht?

1330
01:41:23,246 --> 01:41:25,376
Where's the yacht?

1331
01:41:25,378 --> 01:41:28,442
You know this, Abigail,
I am a very rich man.

1332
01:41:28,444 --> 01:41:32,080
When we get back,
I can do good things for you.

1333
01:41:32,082 --> 01:41:34,541
I can make your
life easy and nice.

1334
01:41:34,543 --> 01:41:37,113
- When we get back?
- Yeah.

1335
01:41:37,115 --> 01:41:39,442
When we get back.
People are looking for us.

1336
01:41:39,444 --> 01:41:42,574
What, you think that
we'll stay here forever? What?

1337
01:41:42,576 --> 01:41:45,277
You're funny.

1338
01:41:45,279 --> 01:41:48,739
This is not how you were
trained, Abigail. Please give...

1339
01:41:48,741 --> 01:41:50,882
Whoa!

1340
01:41:53,082 --> 01:41:55,607
Come on,
this is ridiculous.

1341
01:41:57,213 --> 01:42:00,475
You're scaring people.
Put the stick down.

1342
01:42:01,708 --> 01:42:03,179
Hey!

1343
01:42:08,378 --> 01:42:10,014
Who am I?

1344
01:42:11,411 --> 01:42:13,915
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

1345
01:42:13,917 --> 01:42:18,113
- You're the toilet manager.
- No.

1346
01:42:18,115 --> 01:42:22,816
On the yacht, toilet manager.
Here... captain. Who am I?

1347
01:42:26,950 --> 01:42:29,047
You're the captain.

1348
01:42:30,708 --> 01:42:31,948
Yes.

1349
01:42:34,917 --> 01:42:37,607
- Who am I?
- Captain.

1350
01:42:37,609 --> 01:42:40,739
- Very
good. Cutie pie?
- Captain.

1351
01:42:41,543 --> 01:42:44,047
- Who am I?
- Captain.

1352
01:42:44,049 --> 01:42:45,948
- Who am I?
- The captain.

1353
01:42:46,774 --> 01:42:48,948
Who am I?

1354
01:42:52,774 --> 01:42:54,244
Who am I?

1355
01:42:56,279 --> 01:42:58,014
Who am I?

1356
01:43:07,345 --> 01:43:10,409
In the yacht, cleaning lady.
Here, captain.

1357
01:43:11,279 --> 01:43:12,783
Okay?

1358
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:29,047
Have one more.

1359
01:43:29,049 --> 01:43:30,541
Thank you.

1360
01:43:31,609 --> 01:43:33,706
I would say, I agree.

1361
01:43:33,708 --> 01:43:37,607
I mean, er...
we have to work together.

1362
01:43:38,609 --> 01:43:42,113
And... create a good group.

1363
01:43:42,115 --> 01:43:43,739
Good society.

1364
01:43:43,741 --> 01:43:46,376
Do you know the saying,

1365
01:43:46,378 --> 01:43:49,739
"From each according
to his ability,

1366
01:43:49,741 --> 01:43:52,706
"to each according
to his needs"?

1367
01:43:55,609 --> 01:43:57,816
You don't know this?

1368
01:43:58,950 --> 01:44:00,640
Ma'am Paula...

1369
01:44:03,543 --> 01:44:09,014
With respect to your expertise
in this situation...

1370
01:44:10,609 --> 01:44:14,409
...I would like to make a
suggestion, if that's okay?

1371
01:44:15,708 --> 01:44:17,244
Sure.

1372
01:44:19,708 --> 01:44:22,783
My suggestion is that
the boys...

1373
01:44:24,082 --> 01:44:29,014
stay here and watch the fire,
and take care of madame.

1374
01:44:29,016 --> 01:44:34,640
While you, ma'am Paula, and you
sleep with me in the lifeboat.

1375
01:45:01,774 --> 01:45:03,211
Thank you.

1376
01:45:10,115 --> 01:45:12,508
Hey,
Abigail, look this...

1377
01:45:13,444 --> 01:45:15,772
I would give you
my Patek Philippe.

1378
01:45:15,774 --> 01:45:18,277
For one night in
the boat. Hey, Abigail...

1379
01:45:18,279 --> 01:45:20,882
150 thousand euros!

1380
01:45:21,950 --> 01:45:25,915
- Let us in.
- For you...
original Rolex.

1381
01:45:32,774 --> 01:45:36,409
Nelson... she left the bag.

1382
01:45:37,279 --> 01:45:39,607
- What?
- She left the bag.

1383
01:45:42,774 --> 01:45:45,113
What's in it?

1384
01:45:55,708 --> 01:45:57,948
Pretzel sticks.

1385
01:46:02,609 --> 01:46:06,783
- No, we can't have it.
- I'm just gonna have
a look. Alright?

1386
01:46:12,576 --> 01:46:15,772
- Nice!
- We can't. No.

1387
01:46:23,741 --> 01:46:25,508
- Wait...
- What are you doing?

1388
01:46:25,510 --> 01:46:27,014
Wait, wait, wait...

1389
01:46:33,708 --> 01:46:35,179
Maybe...

1390
01:46:38,115 --> 01:46:40,948
...if we just make a
little hole here...

1391
01:46:41,749 --> 01:46:47,113
Take two out. One each.
They'll never notice it.

1392
01:46:47,115 --> 01:46:49,113
Okay, let me try.

1393
01:46:52,774 --> 01:46:55,113
- Stop it, stop it, stop it...
- Now?

1394
01:47:07,708 --> 01:47:09,816
That was perfect!

1395
01:47:12,213 --> 01:47:15,376
- I don't wanna eat it!
I wanna save it!
- So good!

1396
01:47:17,378 --> 01:47:19,179
Put it back.

1397
01:47:36,279 --> 01:47:37,607
Hmm...

1398
01:47:43,950 --> 01:47:46,277
- Shall we just have one more?
- Yeah.

1399
01:47:46,279 --> 01:47:47,508
Yeah!

1400
01:47:59,312 --> 01:48:00,882
Vera!

1401
01:49:05,444 --> 01:49:07,849
So, what happened here?

1402
01:49:07,851 --> 01:49:10,607
Er... we made a mistake with...

1403
01:49:12,213 --> 01:49:14,211
Why?

1404
01:49:14,213 --> 01:49:16,376
We just fell asleep.

1405
01:49:16,378 --> 01:49:20,739
Now I won't have enough
time to go fish, because I
have to make another fire.

1406
01:49:22,082 --> 01:49:25,080
It takes a lot of work
to make a fire, you know.

1407
01:49:25,082 --> 01:49:26,915
Yeah, yeah. We know.

1408
01:49:43,345 --> 01:49:45,080
Okay.

1409
01:49:46,917 --> 01:49:50,211
Okay. Okay, okay.
Let's get this day started.

1410
01:49:50,213 --> 01:49:52,409
Come on, everybody. Let's go.

1411
01:49:54,181 --> 01:49:55,915
- Okay.
- Cool.

1412
01:49:55,917 --> 01:49:58,981
Wait, wait, wait.
There's one more thing.

1413
01:50:00,642 --> 01:50:04,948
Because, last night,
we left our backpack here,

1414
01:50:04,950 --> 01:50:08,277
and, well,
we're not very sure, but...

1415
01:50:08,279 --> 01:50:11,816
...we think we're missing
a pack of pretzel sticks.

1416
01:50:12,950 --> 01:50:15,475
- You didn't take it, did you?
- No.

1417
01:50:15,477 --> 01:50:16,981
No.

1418
01:50:19,246 --> 01:50:21,442
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, we're sure! Come on.

1419
01:50:21,444 --> 01:50:24,948
- Why are we being accused?
- Oh, no, I'm not accusing you.

1420
01:50:24,950 --> 01:50:27,179
I'm just making sure, because...

1421
01:50:33,543 --> 01:50:34,915
What's this?

1422
01:50:36,950 --> 01:50:38,772
- Well, we didn't...
- You didn't?

1423
01:50:38,774 --> 01:50:40,244
- No.
- No, we didn't.

1424
01:50:40,246 --> 01:50:43,113
- And you're sure you didn't?
- We are sure we didn't.

1425
01:50:43,115 --> 01:50:45,047
- Very sure?
- Yes.

1426
01:50:48,246 --> 01:50:51,849
- I think they need
to be punished.
- Yes, ma'am Paula.

1427
01:50:54,741 --> 01:50:57,113
This is really bad.

1428
01:50:57,115 --> 01:50:59,508
This is really, really bad.

1429
01:51:00,576 --> 01:51:02,508
Oh, come on...

1430
01:51:02,510 --> 01:51:04,673
I mean, you didn't
watch the fire.

1431
01:51:04,675 --> 01:51:07,146
And then you steal
a pack of pretzel sticks?

1432
01:51:07,148 --> 01:51:10,080
- Yeah, and lie about it.
- We deserved it.

1433
01:51:10,082 --> 01:51:13,146
And not just to me,
to everybody here.

1434
01:51:14,950 --> 01:51:17,146
How can we trust you,
after what you did?

1435
01:51:17,148 --> 01:51:19,607
I need to say something
now, because this is
becoming ridiculous.

1436
01:51:19,609 --> 01:51:24,014
- No, let me say something, Abigail.
- - Did you see that?

1437
01:51:24,016 --> 01:51:25,849
What?

1438
01:51:25,851 --> 01:51:28,981
Don't point at her.
Put your hands down.

1439
01:51:30,282 --> 01:51:33,882
- Okay, alright, Just let me say, though...
- - Put your hands down!

1440
01:51:34,510 --> 01:51:36,080
What?

1441
01:51:36,082 --> 01:51:38,948
Your body language
is so aggressive, Carl!

1442
01:51:38,950 --> 01:51:42,113
- What?
- - I'm not getting any food for you.

1443
01:51:42,115 --> 01:51:45,739
- You find your own food.
- What? Come on, man...

1444
01:51:45,741 --> 01:51:49,113
- No, Abigail, that's so unfair!
- Put your hands down.

1445
01:51:49,115 --> 01:51:52,541
You seriously don't get it.
Put your hands down!

1446
01:51:52,543 --> 01:51:56,244
- I'm trying to defend myself.
- Don't defend yourself!

1447
01:51:56,246 --> 01:52:00,244
You are inflicting pain on her
by defending yourself.

1448
01:52:18,082 --> 01:52:20,783
Shut the fuck up! No...

1449
01:52:23,213 --> 01:52:24,706
No!

1450
01:52:52,246 --> 01:52:54,607
Hey! Ha-ha!

1451
01:52:55,884 --> 01:52:58,816
Oh... hey.

1452
01:52:59,741 --> 01:53:02,706
- What a nice fish, huh?
- Yes.

1453
01:53:02,708 --> 01:53:04,882
- Wow!
- We have a lot.

1454
01:53:05,774 --> 01:53:08,376
So it's dinner, huh? Great.

1455
01:53:10,115 --> 01:53:13,706
- Where did you get it?
- There, at the
back of the rock.

1456
01:53:14,950 --> 01:53:17,783
- You're good at that.
- Thank you.

1457
01:53:21,444 --> 01:53:22,948
You need help?

1458
01:53:22,950 --> 01:53:26,310
Yeah, sure, get some Nutella.

1459
01:53:48,609 --> 01:53:50,508
Oh, thank you!

1460
01:55:10,115 --> 01:55:12,047
What?

1461
01:55:23,411 --> 01:55:26,948
- Yaya? Wait, wait!
- Dickhead! Piss off!

1462
01:55:48,774 --> 01:55:52,113
Okay, I'm going
to the lifeboat now.

1463
01:55:52,115 --> 01:55:55,277
Ma'am Paula, can you stay here
and watch the fire?

1464
01:55:55,279 --> 01:55:56,739
Sure.

1465
01:55:59,609 --> 01:56:04,475
And since Carl didn't eat
anything today, he can sleep
with me in the lifeboat.

1466
01:56:06,444 --> 01:56:08,014
Okay. Yeah.

1467
01:56:13,247 --> 01:56:17,442
- Can I come?
- - Abigail, can we both come or...?

1468
01:56:17,444 --> 01:56:19,816
No, just you.

1469
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:26,739
- Fine, I'll take the pretzels!
- - Eh?

1470
01:56:31,246 --> 01:56:33,146
You're making this
into an issue.

1471
01:56:33,148 --> 01:56:35,442
Are you going to take them?
Yes, take them. Good.

1472
01:56:35,444 --> 01:56:38,772
Why are you making
this into an issue?

1473
01:56:38,774 --> 01:56:40,948
I'm coming! One second!

1474
01:56:47,049 --> 01:56:50,739
- What are you gonna
do on the boat?
- I don't know.

1475
01:56:52,444 --> 01:56:54,211
Don't act naive, seriously!

1476
01:56:54,213 --> 01:56:56,442
I don't know why she
asked me, but I'm gonna
do it, of course...

1477
01:56:56,444 --> 01:56:58,014
- Really?
- Yes.

1478
01:56:58,016 --> 01:57:00,541
What do you think
she wants with you?

1479
01:57:00,543 --> 01:57:03,244
You're a young, hot guy.
What do you think she's
going to do with you?

1480
01:57:04,884 --> 01:57:07,244
- Okay, then give them back...
- No. No!

1481
01:57:07,246 --> 01:57:10,244
- Let me take them back.
- No. And they're mine, okay?

1482
01:57:10,246 --> 01:57:12,816
Take a few, and I'll take them
back, cos I don't wanna do this.

1483
01:57:12,818 --> 01:57:14,673
- It's not a good idea.
- I want these!

1484
01:57:14,675 --> 01:57:19,244
You need to tell me what
to do! You need to tell
me how to navigate this.

1485
01:57:24,950 --> 01:57:26,376
Yaya?

1486
01:57:30,049 --> 01:57:32,706
You just have to stroke her ego.

1487
01:57:35,774 --> 01:57:39,244
Just... laugh at her jokes.

1488
01:57:39,246 --> 01:57:41,706
- And... and smile.
- Mm-hmm...

1489
01:57:42,774 --> 01:57:44,211
Okay.

1490
01:57:44,213 --> 01:57:47,113
- Make sure to
set up boundaries.
- Yeah.

1491
01:57:47,115 --> 01:57:51,113
- And nothing sexual, okay?
- No, I won't do
anything sexual.

1492
01:57:51,708 --> 01:57:53,080
Mm-hmm...

1493
01:57:53,082 --> 01:57:54,915
And don't do anything
you wouldn't want me to do.

1494
01:57:54,917 --> 01:57:57,113
No, I won't do anything
you're not comfortable with.

1495
01:57:57,115 --> 01:58:00,146
No kissing. Nothing like that!

1496
01:58:04,411 --> 01:58:06,541
Yaya, I think she's probably
expecting something.

1497
01:58:08,279 --> 01:58:11,475
- Like what?
- I don't know... I, er...

1498
01:58:12,609 --> 01:58:14,508
- A massage, or...
- A massage?

1499
01:58:14,510 --> 01:58:17,442
- I don't know. She
might want something.
- Definitely not a massage!

1500
01:58:17,444 --> 01:58:19,948
She just gave me a whole fucking
packet of pretzels for you...

1501
01:58:19,950 --> 01:58:22,442
I don't know what to say...
I can't do anything?

1502
01:58:22,444 --> 01:58:24,211
- No!
- Okay, but...

1503
01:58:24,213 --> 01:58:27,080
- Massage her neck. Okay?
- I can massage her neck?

1504
01:58:27,082 --> 01:58:29,541
- Her neck, that's it!
- Okay, okay, okay...

1505
01:58:31,884 --> 01:58:33,640
Okay.

1506
01:58:35,774 --> 01:58:38,277
- I love you so much.
- Well, I hate you.

1507
01:58:38,279 --> 01:58:40,706
I understand! Fuck...

1508
01:58:41,441 --> 01:58:44,080
Yeah... Coming!

1509
01:59:01,884 --> 01:59:03,948
- See you in a bit.
- Morning.

1510
01:59:04,950 --> 01:59:07,343
- Oh, morning.
- Asshole.

1511
01:59:08,818 --> 01:59:11,706
Yaya!
Yaya, wait. Wait.

1512
01:59:18,774 --> 01:59:21,673
Hey, you!

1513
01:59:54,708 --> 01:59:57,014
- See you later.
- Okay.

1514
01:59:57,016 --> 02:00:00,541
Pirate! Pirate! He's
coming! He got caught!

1515
02:00:05,510 --> 02:00:07,277
Disgusting.

1516
02:00:07,279 --> 02:00:09,277
What?

1517
02:00:20,884 --> 02:00:23,014
What the fuck?

1518
02:00:24,049 --> 02:00:26,080
Oh, fucking hell...

1519
02:00:43,851 --> 02:00:46,783
- Pretty boy!
- We can see you!

1520
02:00:57,983 --> 02:01:01,442
Have you ever used your...
when you were young?

1521
02:01:02,874 --> 02:01:03,874
In den Wolken.

1522
02:01:04,246 --> 02:01:06,574
Oh, you slept with somebody
to get a job?

1523
02:01:06,708 --> 02:01:07,958
Nein, nein, nein!

1524
02:01:17,708 --> 02:01:19,739
No, you didn't?

1525
02:01:19,741 --> 02:01:22,442
Really? Once?

1526
02:01:22,444 --> 02:01:24,508
Once doesn't count.

1527
02:01:27,774 --> 02:01:30,574
Therese... Wow!

1528
02:01:35,576 --> 02:01:37,772
Where is it?

1529
02:01:37,774 --> 02:01:41,047
- Give it to me!
- Take it! Take it.

1530
02:01:44,279 --> 02:01:47,244
You're acting like children.
Give me the whistle!

1531
02:01:47,246 --> 02:01:49,310
Give me the whistle now!

1532
02:01:51,917 --> 02:01:53,640
So childish!

1533
02:02:23,444 --> 02:02:25,113
Hey...

1534
02:02:25,115 --> 02:02:27,673
- Pirate? What was it?
- Did you see it?

1535
02:02:27,675 --> 02:02:30,244
- What was it?
- I don't know what it is.

1536
02:02:34,016 --> 02:02:37,706
- What's going on?
- They're hunting something.

1537
02:02:42,016 --> 02:02:46,244
No. We don't go there.
What?

1538
02:02:46,246 --> 02:02:48,409
- Come on, guys!
- Shh!

1539
02:02:55,016 --> 02:02:57,179
Nelson, give me that.

1540
02:02:59,115 --> 02:03:01,442
Are you sure?

1541
02:03:19,213 --> 02:03:20,706
Fuck...

1542
02:03:27,411 --> 02:03:29,244
It's a female.

1543
02:03:30,312 --> 02:03:31,948
Kill it.

1544
02:03:49,115 --> 02:03:51,541
- Whoo!
- Ya!

1545
02:03:57,213 --> 02:04:00,113
It's moving. It's moving.

1546
02:04:00,115 --> 02:04:02,882
- What?
- It's not dead. It's not dead.

1547
02:04:02,884 --> 02:04:06,080
- It's moving.
- It's not dead.

1548
02:04:09,112 --> 02:04:11,310
- What's he doing?
- No, no, no.

1549
02:04:12,774 --> 02:04:14,772
Ah, again! Do it again!

1550
02:04:25,576 --> 02:04:28,849
Jarmo! Jarmo...<i> la tempe.</i>

1551
02:04:36,774 --> 02:04:38,783
Hey, you did it!

1552
02:04:49,049 --> 02:04:53,948
Hunter Jarmo! Big
hunter! Come on!

1553
02:04:53,950 --> 02:04:58,574
- Give him applause! Hey!
- Jarmo!
Jarmo! Jarmo...

1554
02:05:00,774 --> 02:05:04,772
- Big donkey hunt!
- Come on, speech!

1555
02:05:04,774 --> 02:05:08,113
- Okay, okay!
- The donkey fairytale...

1556
02:05:08,115 --> 02:05:11,113
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
- Thank you very much.

1557
02:05:11,115 --> 02:05:17,047
Okay... To kill a donkey,
it may be a great achievement.

1558
02:05:17,049 --> 02:05:20,080
But there's one thing
that's so much greater.

1559
02:05:20,082 --> 02:05:23,541
- To paint!
- To paint, yes!

1560
02:05:24,213 --> 02:05:27,277
To paint a donkey!

1561
02:05:27,279 --> 02:05:30,113
Yes!

1562
02:05:33,275 --> 02:05:35,475
Let's take a look
at the expression.

1563
02:05:35,477 --> 02:05:38,146
- Who did this one?
- Me.

1564
02:05:38,148 --> 02:05:41,541
Okay, the feet are
close, close together.

1565
02:05:41,543 --> 02:05:44,948
This donkey wants
to be in control.

1566
02:05:44,950 --> 02:05:48,409
But it looks almost scared.

1567
02:05:49,213 --> 02:05:51,475
You want to tell
this donkey to...

1568
02:05:52,477 --> 02:05:54,376
...to not be so scared.

1569
02:05:54,378 --> 02:05:59,409
To lose control and bound away
across the fields,

1570
02:05:59,411 --> 02:06:02,310
wildly waving its tail!

1571
02:06:03,312 --> 02:06:06,816
- Sure, it will make mistakes...
- Carl, what are you doing?

1572
02:06:10,708 --> 02:06:11,981
Huh?

1573
02:06:13,444 --> 02:06:15,574
- Carl?
- Yeah.

1574
02:06:18,115 --> 02:06:20,409
What are you doing
with your hand?

1575
02:06:23,115 --> 02:06:26,179
- Which one?
- Seriously?

1576
02:06:30,708 --> 02:06:32,981
I'm just resting
it on the chair.

1577
02:06:35,115 --> 02:06:38,475
Why is your hand
under her jacket on a chair?

1578
02:06:40,115 --> 02:06:41,706
What...?

1579
02:06:42,607 --> 02:06:44,915
It was just...
I don't know, it was there,

1580
02:06:44,917 --> 02:06:47,706
resting on the side
of... the chair.

1581
02:07:10,642 --> 02:07:13,706
I'm coming.
I'm coming!

1582
02:07:15,016 --> 02:07:16,739
I'm coming...

1583
02:07:16,741 --> 02:07:19,541
- Oh, I can't concentrate...
- Oh, God!

1584
02:07:35,477 --> 02:07:37,508
Okay, you know...

1585
02:07:37,510 --> 02:07:41,211
...if you can't handle it,
just tell me, nobody's
forcing you to do anything.

1586
02:07:41,213 --> 02:07:45,277
It's just all this fucking
sneaking around and hiding
things from everyone.

1587
02:07:45,279 --> 02:07:48,574
It's too much. It's...
it's becoming unbearable.

1588
02:07:48,576 --> 02:07:52,409
I mean, they're obviously
not happy with what
we're doing in here.

1589
02:07:54,818 --> 02:07:59,244
Okay, so... Let's just...
tell them the truth.

1590
02:08:02,576 --> 02:08:07,915
You give me something, and I
give you something in return.

1591
02:08:13,016 --> 02:08:15,640
You realize what position
that puts me in?

1592
02:08:16,741 --> 02:08:18,047
No.

1593
02:08:19,741 --> 02:08:23,882
Well, just because it's
more open that you're
a flesh peddler,

1594
02:08:23,884 --> 02:08:25,739
it doesn't mean
they're gonna accept the fact

1595
02:08:25,741 --> 02:08:28,442
that you're buying sex
with the common food.

1596
02:08:29,115 --> 02:08:30,981
Wow...

1597
02:08:32,082 --> 02:08:33,673
Oh, come on, I didn't...

1598
02:08:33,675 --> 02:08:36,113
Do you know the amount of work
I put into this island?

1599
02:08:36,115 --> 02:08:39,277
- I go fishing every day,
I make fire...
- I know, I know.

1600
02:08:39,279 --> 02:08:41,915
- I'm responsible
for everybody here!
- I know, I'm sorry, I know.

1601
02:08:41,917 --> 02:08:46,047
- Shouldn't that give
me an advantage?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

1602
02:08:46,049 --> 02:08:49,783
- Okay!
- You deserve to do
what you want, I know.

1603
02:08:57,741 --> 02:09:00,739
The absurd thing is that,
if we were a couple,

1604
02:09:00,741 --> 02:09:03,607
they wouldn't care
what we did in here.

1605
02:09:06,444 --> 02:09:10,277
But, really, maybe we
should just do that, maybe
we should just get on with it.

1606
02:09:10,279 --> 02:09:13,277
I don't know, kiss a little
bit in public and hold hands.

1607
02:09:13,279 --> 02:09:16,047
- Surely that would be easier?
- What about Yaya?

1608
02:09:16,049 --> 02:09:20,113
I would have a conversation
with Yaya. I would have to
be an adult about it.

1609
02:09:20,115 --> 02:09:24,882
And figure it out, but...
I think it would be easier
for her, probably.

1610
02:09:24,884 --> 02:09:27,607
I mean, she's having to deal
with all this gossip as well.

1611
02:09:27,609 --> 02:09:29,948
Carl, I... I don't know.

1612
02:09:38,444 --> 02:09:40,915
Do you want me
to break up with Yaya?

1613
02:09:40,917 --> 02:09:42,607
- No.
- No?

1614
02:09:44,741 --> 02:09:47,310
That's your decision, not mine.

1615
02:09:50,115 --> 02:09:54,244
I'm not asking you to do it,
I'm just seeing what
you think about it.

1616
02:09:54,246 --> 02:09:57,915
I know, but that doesn't
mean that you can put me
in-between the two of you.

1617
02:09:57,917 --> 02:09:59,442
Okay, okay.

1618
02:10:07,708 --> 02:10:10,277
It's kind of a perfect
scenario for you, I mean...

1619
02:10:11,774 --> 02:10:14,113
You get what you want,
you have no obligations,

1620
02:10:14,115 --> 02:10:16,442
no responsibilities, you know.

1621
02:10:16,444 --> 02:10:18,607
Why do you have to make
everything so complicated?

1622
02:10:18,609 --> 02:10:22,146
Because I feel like I
need to know where
this is going, Abigail.

1623
02:10:24,576 --> 02:10:26,607
Let's just have fun.

1624
02:10:26,609 --> 02:10:28,948
No, but I need to try to deal
with this situation.

1625
02:10:28,950 --> 02:10:31,047
I... I don't wanna piss off...

1626
02:10:33,279 --> 02:10:35,640
I don't wanna annoy
anyone anymore.

1627
02:10:37,950 --> 02:10:41,706
Do you remember what you said
the first night you were here?

1628
02:10:41,708 --> 02:10:43,541
What did you say?

1629
02:10:45,609 --> 02:10:48,442
"I love you, you give me fish."

1630
02:10:48,444 --> 02:10:50,113
Exactly.

1631
02:10:50,115 --> 02:10:53,442
And do you know why
that is so beautiful?

1632
02:10:53,444 --> 02:10:55,047
- No.
- Like you...

1633
02:10:55,049 --> 02:10:57,541
- Why?
- Because it's the truth.

1634
02:11:02,642 --> 02:11:05,706
So, Nelson... you're
a pirate, huh?

1635
02:11:07,115 --> 02:11:08,948
Come on, stop it.

1636
02:11:09,291 --> 02:11:10,541
In den Wolken?

1637
02:11:11,049 --> 02:11:14,310
Okay. If I was a pirate,
what would you ask me?

1638
02:11:14,312 --> 02:11:16,783
How much money do you make?

1639
02:11:18,115 --> 02:11:19,948
Yeah, of course.

1640
02:11:19,950 --> 02:11:23,310
I don't know,
like... 3,000 euros.

1641
02:11:23,312 --> 02:11:25,607
- On one attack?
- Yeah, one attack.

1642
02:11:26,444 --> 02:11:28,211
If we succeed.

1643
02:11:29,148 --> 02:11:32,277
So, you work on commission, huh?

1644
02:11:32,279 --> 02:11:34,277
- Yeah.
- Shit!

1645
02:11:34,279 --> 02:11:36,706
The client is making all money?

1646
02:11:37,507 --> 02:11:40,849
Yeah, but you can make more
if you have your own boat.

1647
02:11:43,246 --> 02:11:46,816
3,000 euros...
Come on, you're crazy.

1648
02:11:47,774 --> 02:11:50,244
My girlfriend is expensive.

1649
02:11:50,246 --> 02:11:52,981
What? You invest in
your girlfriend?

1650
02:11:52,983 --> 02:11:55,080
- Yeah.
- Ah...

1651
02:11:55,082 --> 02:11:57,739
You should do it
the other way around.

1652
02:11:57,741 --> 02:12:01,113
Invest in business, buy a boat,
and the girls will come to you.

1653
02:12:01,115 --> 02:12:02,310
Yeah?

1654
02:12:02,912 --> 02:12:05,244
Sure, I know. Ha-ha!

1655
02:12:20,983 --> 02:12:22,882
Hey.

1656
02:12:22,884 --> 02:12:25,816
I was just wondering
if I could borrow the backpack.

1657
02:12:25,818 --> 02:12:28,541
- Abigail?
- Yeah, I know.

1658
02:12:28,543 --> 02:12:30,211
- What are you going
to do, Yaya?

1659
02:12:30,213 --> 02:12:31,915
- Go for a hike over
the mountain.

1660
02:12:31,917 --> 02:12:34,146
See if I can find something.

1661
02:12:37,411 --> 02:12:41,277
- I'll go with you.
- It's okay, I can go by myself.

1662
02:12:41,279 --> 02:12:45,179
No, Yaya, it's not safe for you
to go alone. I'll go with you.

1663
02:12:46,477 --> 02:12:48,014
Okay.

1664
02:12:52,411 --> 02:12:56,475
- Do you want me to come?
- No. You stay here.

1665
02:12:56,477 --> 02:12:58,607
I need some time alone with her.

1666
02:12:58,609 --> 02:13:00,179
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1667
02:13:06,181 --> 02:13:08,047
I'll take it.

1668
02:13:35,884 --> 02:13:38,146
I'm glad we're doing
this together, Yaya.

1669
02:13:40,115 --> 02:13:41,607
Me, too.

1670
02:13:42,408 --> 02:13:44,981
I actually wanted
to tell you that I'm...

1671
02:13:44,983 --> 02:13:47,915
...really impressed by
everything you're doing here.

1672
02:13:48,750 --> 02:13:52,574
I mean, you managed to run
a fucking matriarchy, Abigail.

1673
02:14:00,279 --> 02:14:03,442
You domesticated
all the old alpha males.

1674
02:14:03,444 --> 02:14:04,948
Yeah!

1675
02:14:07,708 --> 02:14:09,146
Thank you.

1676
02:14:12,950 --> 02:14:15,047
No, it's really impressive.

1677
02:14:23,082 --> 02:14:25,574
We should stick together, huh?

1678
02:14:51,279 --> 02:14:53,014
Oh, my God...

1679
02:14:55,950 --> 02:14:58,816
I think it should be
a little easier from here.

1680
02:15:34,834 --> 02:15:36,084
In den Wolken!

1681
02:15:38,834 --> 02:15:40,792
In den Wolken!

1682
02:15:58,084 --> 02:16:00,959
Gucci bag, Louis Vuitton, Chanel...

1683
02:16:02,166 --> 02:16:03,708
Same factory.

1684
02:16:20,126 --> 02:16:23,126
Rolex, sunglasses, selfie stick.

1685
02:16:28,541 --> 02:16:30,542
In den Wolken, Uli.

1686
02:16:36,016 --> 02:16:38,146
<i> Nein, nein.</i>

1687
02:16:40,181 --> 02:16:41,739
Huh?

1688
02:17:00,834 --> 02:17:02,042
What you mean?

1689
02:17:03,709 --> 02:17:04,791
What you mean?

1690
02:17:15,917 --> 02:17:16,875
Nein, nein, nein...

1691
02:17:17,042 --> 02:17:18,458
I got my own wife.

1692
02:17:18,709 --> 02:17:20,542
In den Wolken!

1693
02:17:28,115 --> 02:17:30,113
Abigail!

1694
02:17:30,115 --> 02:17:31,607
Yeah?

1695
02:17:32,708 --> 02:17:34,706
I see something!

1696
02:17:38,279 --> 02:17:41,343
A what?

1697
02:17:43,115 --> 02:17:46,146
I can't hear you!

1698
02:17:49,279 --> 02:17:52,475
- Abigail! Hurry up!
- I'm coming!

1699
02:17:53,609 --> 02:17:55,981
- Abigail!
- Yaya!

1700
02:17:58,115 --> 02:18:01,607
Yaya!

1701
02:18:01,609 --> 02:18:03,146
Abigail!

1702
02:18:04,774 --> 02:18:08,310
Abigail!
Abigail, there's an elevator!

1703
02:18:10,950 --> 02:18:13,409
- It's a resort, Abigail!
- A what?

1704
02:18:13,411 --> 02:18:15,146
It's a resort!

1705
02:18:18,675 --> 02:18:22,739
Come, look! It's
a luxury resort!

1706
02:18:27,115 --> 02:18:29,442
It's been there the whole time!

1707
02:18:29,444 --> 02:18:32,739
It's been there
the whole fucking time, Abigail!

1708
02:18:46,675 --> 02:18:48,080
Come.

1709
02:18:51,148 --> 02:18:54,409
Come, Abigail. Come.

1710
02:19:01,884 --> 02:19:03,310
Abigail?

1711
02:19:05,543 --> 02:19:07,816
Let's enjoy this moment.

1712
02:19:42,708 --> 02:19:45,179
- It's surreal, huh?
- Yeah.

1713
02:19:59,609 --> 02:20:02,080
You must be excited
to see your kids, huh?

1714
02:20:03,609 --> 02:20:06,640
- I don't have kids.
- Ah...

1715
02:20:08,246 --> 02:20:09,739
Sorry.

1716
02:20:20,411 --> 02:20:21,915
Let's go.

1717
02:20:23,818 --> 02:20:25,475
I need to wee-wee.

1718
02:20:26,210 --> 02:20:28,343
- Yeah.
- And then we will go.

1719
02:20:28,345 --> 02:20:29,739
Okay.

1720
02:21:37,279 --> 02:21:38,739
Abigail?

1721
02:21:43,115 --> 02:21:45,442
Abigail, I can try and help you.

1722
02:21:47,444 --> 02:21:49,783
I don't know how, but...

1723
02:21:54,115 --> 02:21:58,739
Abigail... maybe you can come
and work for me?

1724
02:21:59,207 --> 02:22:01,277
You could be my assistant.

1725
02:22:08,444 --> 02:22:09,948
Aargh!

1726
02:22:24,115 --> 02:22:25,409
Fuck!

1727
02:22:27,543 --> 02:22:28,849
Aargh!
