1
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,125
<i>I've been here before...</i>

2
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:20,250
<i>over and over again,</i>
<i>and each time the same question.</i>

3
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:24,041
<i>- Is this it?</i>

4
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,916
<i>Will this time be the one?</i>

5
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,375
<i>And each time the same answer.</i>

6
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,666
<i>And I'm just so tired of it.</i>

7
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:46,750
You good?

8
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:48,916
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

9
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,708
You travel?

10
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:52,333
I did.

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,250
And I got you something.

12
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,333
What's that?

13
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:00,333
Ooh, first edition <i>Don Quixote.</i>

14
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:02,541
-That couldn't have been cheap.
<i>-</i>It wasn't.

15
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,041
So why am I here, Booker?

16
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,625
You remember Surabaya
eight years ago, right?

17
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:08,625
CIA.

18
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:11,500
Yeah. The guy who hired us,
James Copley, reached out.

19
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:12,625
He's freelance now.

20
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:15,458
He has a hostage situation in South Sudan.

21
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,708
No, Booker. We don't do repeats.
You know that.

22
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:19,750
It's too risky.

23
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:22,666
Andy.

24
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:27,750
Joe and Nicky?

25
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:29,625
At the hotel.

26
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,166
Come back again.

27
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,833
Thank you. Welcome to El Fenn, sir.

28
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,416
Checking in?

29
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,166
- What brings you to Marrakesh?
- Family.

30
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:01,041
Say, "Marrakesh!"

31
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,208
Marrakesh!

32
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,500
Would you like me to take one for you?

33
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:11,250
Thank you so much.
I just really suck at taking selfies.

34
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,041
There you go.

35
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,625
Thank you!

36
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,708
-You look great.
-You look okay.

37
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:47,375
Thank you! Thank you!

38
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,750
And I have something for you.

39
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:55,916
Nicky!

40
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,625
Baklava.

41
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,041
Five hundred, Booker.

42
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,458
No.

43
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,166
All right.

44
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,625
- All in. Here it is.
- Really?

45
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,416
- All in!
- All in!

46
00:04:19,666 --> 00:04:21,041
Hazelnut, not walnut.

47
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,708
The Black Sea.

48
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,458
Rosewater.

49
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,750
Pomegranate.

50
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,583
Eastern Turkey.

51
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,083
No, no, no. Don't worry.

52
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,208
Admit it, boss. You missed us.

53
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:55,625
I did.

54
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,583
It's a job, guys.

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,333
We can do some good.

56
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,375
Have you been watching the news lately?

57
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,125
Some good means nothing.

58
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,250
I don't know about this, guys.

59
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,833
We're not helping.

60
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,708
I know you needed a break,
but it's been over a year, boss.

61
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,708
This is what we do, Andy.

62
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,083
I'll hear him out.

63
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:04,125
Mr. Copley.

64
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,291
Mr. Booker, <i>bonjour.</i>

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,250
-It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
-Last time I checked,

66
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,833
you had to be American to be in the CIA.

67
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,916
I was born in Boston.

68
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,000
Moved to London when I was three.

69
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,708
So why did you leave the agency,
Mr. Copley?

70
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,750
My wife got sick.

71
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,666
ALS.

72
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,833
She died two years ago.

73
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,833
Just haven't found my way back yet.

74
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,458
-Sorry for your loss.
-Thank you.

75
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,166
You haven't aged a day, Booker.

76
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,458
- Trust me, I have.
- Yeah.

77
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,750
Yesterday afternoon local,

78
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,750
a school southwest of Juba
was attacked by a militia.

79
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,750
They murdered the teachers and abducted
17 of the students at gunpoint.

80
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,291
The youngest was eight...

81
00:06:48,416 --> 00:06:49,416
oldest, 13.

82
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,375
<i>South Sudanese asked the US for help,</i>

83
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:58,375
<i>but current administration's policy</i>
<i>is</i> <i>to deny aid to any nonstrategic allies.</i>

84
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,291
Some of my ex-colleagues at the CIA
feel differently.

85
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:05,916
They reached out to me,
and I'm reaching out to you.

86
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:10,166
The last overfly confirmed
the personnel on site.

87
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,000
No food or water being brought in.

88
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,166
That means
they're moving them soon.

89
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,250
And when they do,

90
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,791
most likely they'll be separated,
and odds are we'll never find them again.

91
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,166
Has to be done quickly...

92
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,416
by the best,
and your team's the best I've ever seen.

93
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,041
You can name your price.

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,666
We'll invoice you when it's done.

95
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:40,958
Peace be with you.

96
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,458
What the...

97
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,583
Are we too late?

98
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:03,916
Motherfuck...

99
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:32,916
Room clear!

100
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,875
- My God!
- Shit!

101
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,541
Look out! Reload!

102
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,750
What the hell?

103
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,291
- Everyone still with me?
- Yeah.

104
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:39,708
Joe?

105
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,791
Very pissed off.

106
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:44,875
So where are the girls?

107
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,083
There never were any girls.

108
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,208
We've been set up.

109
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,166
Yeah, I got it.

110
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,583
Yeah.

111
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,791
One has to admire
Mr. Copley's attention to detail.

112
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:57,208
Those shoes were a particularly
grotesque touch.

113
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,750
I knew this was gonna happen.

114
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,541
I said it.

115
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,666
We did it right, Andy.

116
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,625
-For the right reasons.
-And what did it get us, Nicky? What?

117
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:07,666
Nothing.

118
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,875
We've done nothing.

119
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:12,541
The world isn't getting any better.

120
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,916
It's getting worse.

121
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,208
I checked him completely, and...

122
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:18,250
everything seemed legit.

123
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,666
I'm sorry, guys.

124
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,541
They know who we are.
They know what we are.

125
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,291
We have to find Copley.

126
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:33,875
We have to tie this thing off.

127
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,916
-And then what?
-And then nothing.

128
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,250
The world can burn for all I care.

129
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,458
I'm done.

130
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,500
Freeman, where you at?

131
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:37,875
Here, Sergeant.

132
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,083
The women are holed up in the house
with the arches.

133
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,583
Take a right at the building
with the red carpet.

134
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,750
-Get me some information.
-Roger that.

135
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,208
Keep it respectful.

136
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,125
Don't we always?

137
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,583
Never hurts to repeat it.

138
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,541
My name is Nile.

139
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,625
I am an American Marine.

140
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,875
We are looking for this man.

141
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
He has killed many of our people

142
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,583
and many of yours.

143
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,875
Have any of you seen him?

144
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,875
You do not disrespect your family

145
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,708
by telling us where he is.

146
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:12,333
There are no men here.

147
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,208
To use women as shields
is to be no man at all.

148
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,041
Thank you for allowing us into your home.

149
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:38,458
We will leave you in peace.

150
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,500
Breach!

151
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,500
Stop!

152
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,083
- Clear! Covering!
- Clear!

153
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,916
Lima 3, this is India 5. Contact, over.

154
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,666
Jay, go check on the women.

155
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,708
On it.

156
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,291
Look at all this shit.
It's jackpot.

157
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,708
Not if he bleeds out.
They wanted him alive, remember?

158
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,000
Do not... Do not touch me.

159
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm trying to save you, man.

160
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,583
Dizzy, a little help, please?

161
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:32,833
No! Medic!

162
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:34,000
Man down!

163
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,875
No! Jesus! Medic!

164
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,791
Stay with me!

165
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,375
My...

166
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,958
God! Jesus, no.

167
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,541
Come here. Stay with me. Look at me.

168
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,750
Look at me. You're gonna be okay.

169
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,250
Nile! Nile!

170
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:02,041
You're okay. It's okay.
Stay with me. Just look at me. Look at me.

171
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,625
Okay. Medic's on their way.
Medic's on their way.

172
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,166
No, no. It's okay. It's okay.

173
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,000
The medic's coming!

174
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
What the...

175
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,208
No.

176
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,666
No, not another one.

177
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:31,000
Not now.

178
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,125
It was a woman.

179
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,083
A black woman.

180
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,416
I saw an older woman in a hijab.

181
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,625
What did you see?

182
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:44,666
I saw... I saw part
of a name tag.

183
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,083
Yeah. Free... free something.

184
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,541
-Yeah.
-Dirt floor, clay walls.

185
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,500
And a medevac.

186
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,875
Yeah, so maybe a...
a coalition...

187
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,416
medical team.

188
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:58,666
The knife was a pesh-kabz. Pashtun.

189
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,375
I felt her die.

190
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,458
She's a Marine.

191
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:04,458
Combat.

192
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,791
Or near-combat duty.

193
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,375
Afghanistan.

194
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,583
It's been over 200 years.

195
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,333
Why now?

196
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:23,708
Everything happens for a reason, boss.

197
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:28,583
We have to find her.

198
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,041
No, we stick to the plan. We find Copley.

199
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,500
-So we just leave her out in the open?
-No, we're in the open.

200
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,666
-We're the ones who are exposed now.
-Not like her.

201
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,750
Nicky... Not like her.

202
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,500
You can't tell me you don't remember
what it was like.

203
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:44,708
Whoever she is,
she's confused, and she's scared,

204
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,291
and she's more alone
than she has ever been in her entire life.

205
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,041
We all remember what it was like.

206
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,416
She needs us.

207
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,250
I'll handle the retrieval.

208
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,500
Hey, boss, come on.

209
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:06,083
If we're dreaming about her,
she's dreaming about us.

210
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:07,958
That makes her a beacon straight to us.

211
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:10,666
-What do we do in the meantime?
-Get to France.

212
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,125
Use the Charlie safe house.

213
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:13,833
I'll meet you there.

214
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:16,875
Find Copley.

215
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,041
Jesus.

216
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:25,083
She's just a baby.

217
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:58,708
I know I saw her die.

218
00:24:58,791 --> 00:25:00,541
A little blood can look like a lot.

219
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,791
Adrenaline flying,
everyone was seeing shit they didn't.

220
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:05,041
I was holding her neck together
in my hands.

221
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,916
You'd rather we sent her home
in a body bag?

222
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:10,666
No, of course not.

223
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,666
So come on.

224
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:21,958
Hey, look who's up.

225
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:25,541
Nile?

226
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:29,958
What's up, Jay?

227
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:32,083
What's up, Dizzy?

228
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,708
So let's see the trophy.

229
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:46,583
Fuck me.

230
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,958
Nile, there's not even a scratch.

231
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,041
Yeah, they...

232
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:54,166
They used this new skin graft
or something.

233
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:56,250
That what the doctor said?

234
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,583
Yeah.

235
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:01,791
That's what they said.

236
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:21,000
<i>Our average lifespan is 78</i>
<i>in developed nations.</i>

237
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:24,250
Actually, two more years if you're
lucky enough to be born a female.

238
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,500
What can I say, ladies?

239
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:30,291
Now, all of this is because
of everyone's favorite love-to-hate...

240
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:32,750
Big Pharma.

241
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,375
At my company,
our research on telomere extension

242
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:39,833
has reversed the chromosomal clock
of human stem cells.

243
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:44,000
Dr. Kozak's manipulation
of the klotho hormone will, in time,

244
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:47,541
completely arrest
common cognitive decline.

245
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:50,625
Yes, we can all wave goodbye to dementia.

246
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,416
Now... wait!

247
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,416
Our work will add years of life

248
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,250
to the collective world population.

249
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:59,041
Years. Decades.

250
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:01,958
But it's not cheap.

251
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,666
We need investment.

252
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,208
Investment drives my enthusiasm
to take risks.

253
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:11,500
These risks improve countless lives.

254
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,375
My God.

255
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,250
You've seen my research.

256
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,041
Now you know they're for real.

257
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,708
What about the hard proof?

258
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:42,708
Blood, tissue, bone, DNA.

259
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:47,083
Recovering an uncontaminated sample
of the site proved impossible.

260
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,708
But you promised me hard proof.

261
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:51,291
There was an unanticipated
amount of carnage.

262
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:53,500
-But the footage...
-No, no.

263
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:56,208
The footage is
a two-million-dollar snuff film.

264
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:58,458
It doesn't give her the how.

265
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,833
I need all of them, Copley.

266
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,625
-I think I can get you one.
-No. No, not one. All.

267
00:28:09,708 --> 00:28:12,458
These are extraordinary individuals.

268
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:15,083
They are extremely resistant to capture.

269
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:17,250
Well, consult with Keane, make a plan,
make it happen.

270
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,375
And quickly,
before my competitors get wind of this.

271
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:50,875
Corporal Freeman.

272
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:55,000
-Aye, Sergeant.
-Orders just came through.

273
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,958
They're sending you to Landstuhl, Germany
for more tests.

274
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,333
But I'm fine.

275
00:28:59,416 --> 00:29:01,291
Plane's fueling. Pack your bags.

276
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,875
-Sergeant...
-We took these off you when it happened.

277
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:06,458
Didn't think you were coming back.

278
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:45,083
That's her.

279
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,375
Corporal Freeman.

280
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,583
Been looking for you.

281
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:39,666
Wheels up on your ride.

282
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:48,125
-Who are you?
-Andromache the Scythian.

283
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:54,375
But you can call me Andy.

284
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:27,750
Why does it have to be so goddamn slow
the first couple of times?

285
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,833
You shot me.

286
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:49,000
I did.
I need you to get back in the car, please.

287
00:32:49,916 --> 00:32:52,791
This isn't real.
No, none of this is real.

288
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:55,708
You haven't figured this out yet?
You can't die.

289
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:56,708
Get up.

290
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:58,333
Argh! Fuck!

291
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:05,333
Can you please not do that again?

292
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:15,708
Who are you?

293
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:17,708
I lead a group of immortals.

294
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:19,791
An army, I guess.

295
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,208
Soldiers. Fighters like you.

296
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,125
Look...

297
00:33:25,416 --> 00:33:26,750
You've got questions, kid.

298
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:27,666
I get it.

299
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:30,291
You want answers?

300
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:32,416
Get back in the car.

301
00:34:33,916 --> 00:34:34,916
Put those on.

302
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,416
-Where are you taking me?
-Paris.

303
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:41,500
-You've got blood in your hair.
-Wonder why?

304
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:49,000
This guy's a drug runner.

305
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,750
This the shit you into?

306
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:54,125
Well, sometimes you gotta work with people
you don't wanna eat with.

307
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,250
Is this even safe?

308
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:57,791
Does it really matter?

309
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:03,875
<i>Hey, boss.</i>

310
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:05,125
You found Copley?

311
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:07,000
Nothing but dead ends.

312
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:08,875
<i>He knows we're hunting him.</i>

313
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:09,791
Keep looking.

314
00:35:10,416 --> 00:35:11,833
<i>He's doing the same to us.</i>

315
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:14,541
I have the new one.

316
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:15,791
And?

317
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:19,416
Well, she stabbed me,
so I think she has potential.

318
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:22,958
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

319
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:46,625
So why is this happening to me?

320
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,916
I wish I knew.

321
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,666
You said you had answers.

322
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:52,625
I didn't say you'd like them.

323
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:01,916
Are you praying?

324
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,666
God doesn't exist.

325
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:08,541
My God does.

326
00:37:09,458 --> 00:37:12,541
You know, there was a time
when I was worshiped as a god.

327
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:21,333
Was that Him?

328
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:24,666
Don't worry, I can't do shit like that.

329
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:27,916
None of it means anything anyway.

330
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,000
You said there were others.

331
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:34,625
How many?

332
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:36,041
Four.

333
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:38,791
You're an army of four?

334
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,333
So that's why you took me?

335
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:42,958
So I could join your army?

336
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:44,125
Yeah.

337
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:47,583
No. This is some bullshit.

338
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:51,000
You must...

339
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:53,125
...must have hypnotized me, or...

340
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:56,333
or, drugged me or something.

341
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:59,541
And that was a blank
that you shot me with.

342
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,541
And I was the one who cut your throat.

343
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:03,625
Right?

344
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:11,041
Listen, kid.

345
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,166
You already believe in...

346
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:18,083
You should just keep following
that illogic.

347
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:21,583
You're already on board
with the supernatural.

348
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,875
If I were you, I'd get some sleep.

349
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,208
We're not going to Paris.

350
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,375
Andrei.

351
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:52,125
Come here.

352
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:54,375
Sit your ass down!

353
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,208
- Stand up!
- You do not listen to her.

354
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:58,166
You listen to me.

355
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:00,041
Land this plane.

356
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,500
Trust me. She's not gonna shoot you.

357
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:05,750
I am.

358
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:15,125
Who's gonna fly the plane?

359
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:16,958
We don't need a pilot.

360
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:18,625
We can jump and survive.

361
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:21,125
I am not jumping from a plane!

362
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:29,208
Whoa! Shit! Maybe we do need a pilot.

363
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,583
I can fly a plane.

364
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,208
You don't speak Russian, do you?

365
00:39:45,666 --> 00:39:46,500
Why?

366
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:50,000
Because I told the pilot to play dead.

367
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:11,041
You really want to do this, kid?

368
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:14,041
We're done.

369
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:23,458
I said we're done.

370
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,000
You're very good.

371
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:50,916
What's your name?

372
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,125
Nile.

373
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:01,250
You see? You're already healing faster.

374
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:20,750
Is this real?

375
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:26,625
I got people that love me.

376
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:29,125
People that are gonna worry.

377
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:35,625
I'm a Marine.

378
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:38,458
-They think I went AWOL.
-You're not a Marine anymore.

379
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:40,208
They're going to lock you up.

380
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:17,666
I thought you said
we were going to Paris.

381
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:19,916
We're just outside of Paris.

382
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,166
This is Goussainville.

383
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:24,041
This place has been abandoned
for 50 years.

384
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:26,541
Why?

385
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,958
So are you good guys or bad guys?

386
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:54,000
Depends on the century.

387
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,708
We fight for what we think is right.

388
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:04,833
How are you all in my dreams?

389
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:08,541
We dream of each other.
They stop when we meet.

390
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:09,625
Why?

391
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:14,041
I believe it's because we...
we're meant to find each other.

392
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:17,958
It's like destiny.

393
00:44:18,041 --> 00:44:20,708
No, more like misery loves company.

394
00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:26,750
What he said.

395
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:29,291
It used to take years to track a new one.

396
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,583
Booker was the last.

397
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:32,291
1812.

398
00:44:34,791 --> 00:44:35,750
No way.

399
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:39,416
Yeah, I died fighting with Napoleon.

400
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:43,416
So... you're even older than him.

401
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,875
Nicky and I met in the Crusades.

402
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:48,166
The Crusades?

403
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:51,500
The love of my life was of the people
I've been taught to hate.

404
00:44:51,916 --> 00:44:54,916
We... We
killed each other.

405
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
- Many times.
- Yeah.

406
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:02,750
You're the oldest.

407
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:06,625
Yeah.

408
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:08,333
So how old are you?

409
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,875
-Old.
-How old?

410
00:45:15,875 --> 00:45:16,958
Too old.

411
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:21,541
So we really never die.

412
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:24,166
Nothing that lives lives forever.

413
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:27,041
But... you said that we were immortal.

414
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:28,208
I know what I said.

415
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:33,166
And we mostly are, but we can die.

416
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:35,750
And one of us did.

417
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:38,166
He...

418
00:45:38,666 --> 00:45:40,916
<i>He was a warrior, just like us.</i>

419
00:45:41,541 --> 00:45:42,791
<i>A long time ago.</i>

420
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:46,875
One day your wounds
just don't heal up anymore, and...

421
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,625
we don't know when or why.

422
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:53,708
So if we can die,

423
00:45:55,375 --> 00:45:57,083
then why would you shoot me?

424
00:45:57,875 --> 00:45:59,333
You could have killed me.

425
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:01,833
You're too new.

426
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:08,958
It is a lot to understand.

427
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:12,875
I think you should get some rest.

428
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:15,041
Come with me.

429
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:15,958
I'll show you.

430
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,666
She wants to talk to her family.

431
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:30,041
That's not gonna help her.

432
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:33,958
You tell her that.

433
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:12,041
What's going on?

434
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:15,916
What happened?

435
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,333
It's just a... a bad dream.

436
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:21,541
I'm sorry.

437
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:28,916
Tell us.

438
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:32,208
I saw flashes of it before...

439
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:35,375
when I first dreamt of all of you.

440
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:39,583
But now it's clearer.

441
00:47:42,916 --> 00:47:45,416
I dreamed about
a woman locked in an iron coffin...

442
00:47:46,541 --> 00:47:47,583
under the sea.

443
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:50,500
She kept...

444
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:54,125
drowning and then coming back to life.

445
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:59,708
She was hammering her bloody fists
and knees against the iron.

446
00:47:59,791 --> 00:48:03,750
She felt like something insane,
something furious.

447
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:06,416
But she kept fighting...

448
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:08,916
and she kept drowning.

449
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:20,625
Her name was Quynh.

450
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:24,833
<i>She was one of us.</i>

451
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:27,791
<i>The first immortal Andy found.</i>

452
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,166
<i>They had been alone so long,</i>
<i>when she found her...</i>

453
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:38,000
<i>Quynh had given up.</i>

454
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:43,625
Way back, it was her and Andy.

455
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:47,333
Before me and Nicky,
it was just the two of them.

456
00:48:48,666 --> 00:48:52,375
<i>They ran through the world together.</i>
<i>Fought thousands of battles side by side.</i>

457
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:02,166
<i>She was a pit viper in a fight.</i>

458
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:08,416
They were in England,

459
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:12,208
freeing so-called heretics
from the witch trials.

460
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,833
But then, Andy and Quynh,

461
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:17,625
they were accused of witchcraft
themselves,

462
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:20,958
<i>- and they were trapped and caught.</i>
- Killers!

463
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,041
Some will rot in hell!

464
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:26,958
<i>When they didn't die,</i>
<i>it proved their case,</i>

465
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:28,958
<i>and they got sentenced again and again.</i>

466
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,125
I've never been burned alive before.

467
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:38,583
What do you think it's gonna be like?

468
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:41,500
Excruciating.

469
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,500
Just you and me.

470
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,291
Until the end.

471
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:09,875
No! No!

472
00:50:09,958 --> 00:50:10,833
No, not this.

473
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,125
- No!
- Where are you taking her?

474
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:15,750
You are too powerful together.

475
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:18,291
For creatures such as you,
there is no salvation.

476
00:50:18,375 --> 00:50:20,791
Please! No!

477
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:21,916
Quynh!

478
00:50:26,583 --> 00:50:27,875
Quynh!

479
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:36,500
Andromache!

480
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:41,625
Andromache!

481
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,416
No!

482
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,833
After Andy escaped,
we spent decades searching for her

483
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:08,333
or anyone on that ship
who could tell us where she was cast off.

484
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:11,208
She's lived
with that guilt ever since,

485
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:14,083
but she blames herself for Quynh's fate.

486
00:51:19,458 --> 00:51:20,958
Why do you blame yourself?

487
00:51:21,958 --> 00:51:23,208
I lost a soldier.

488
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,916
I feel her pain.

489
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:29,125
Her rage.

490
00:51:30,416 --> 00:51:31,791
She feels crazy.

491
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:36,208
Over 500 years in a box...

492
00:51:37,583 --> 00:51:39,041
<i>at the bottom of the ocean...</i>

493
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:42,166
<i>would make anyone insane.</i>

494
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:45,583
<i>That's the reason</i>
<i>why we dread capture.</i>

495
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,416
<i>Spend eternity in a cage.</i>

496
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:30,666
Nile.

497
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,166
I don't want this.

498
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:35,791
I don't want any of it.

499
00:52:35,875 --> 00:52:37,125
I know. I know.

500
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:39,708
There isn't one good thing in any of this.

501
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:41,416
I know this is hard.

502
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:45,708
It's happening
whether you want it or not.

503
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,875
I know you're scared, Nile.

504
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:01,375
Me and those three men in there
will keep you safe.

505
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:04,416
Like Quynh?

506
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:11,958
We're all you've got.

507
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:21,166
What's happening?

508
00:53:22,625 --> 00:53:23,500
They found us.

509
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:35,500
Joe? Nicky?

510
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:42,583
Shit.

511
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:44,250
Booker.

512
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,291
You still with me?

513
00:53:51,166 --> 00:53:53,208
Clear the back room. Find Joe and Nicky.

514
00:53:53,875 --> 00:53:54,875
Hey.

515
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:55,791
Hey.

516
00:53:56,541 --> 00:53:57,375
Book.

517
00:53:59,916 --> 00:54:00,833
Come on.

518
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:02,791
Come back to me.

519
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:07,291
You're still in this shitty game with me.

520
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:08,708
You hear me?

521
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:11,666
Now wake up.

522
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:17,833
Wake up!

523
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:24,958
They're not here.

524
00:54:28,958 --> 00:54:30,416
Welcome back, asshole.

525
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:33,000
Thanks for taking your time.

526
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:37,708
It hurts everywhere.

527
00:54:38,583 --> 00:54:39,541
How bad is it?

528
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:42,291
It's an improvement.

529
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:45,875
How many?

530
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:47,708
I don't know.

531
00:54:47,791 --> 00:54:49,916
-Where are Nicky and Joe?
-I don't know!

532
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:53,041
I... I turned on the game.

533
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:57,291
<i>A grenade hit me.</i>

534
00:54:57,375 --> 00:54:59,708
Lost the plot after that.

535
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:04,875
- <i>Two in transport.</i>
- No, no. We need the woman.

536
00:55:04,958 --> 00:55:06,916
<i>Wasn't there,</i>
<i>and the other guy's in pieces.</i>

537
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:09,208
She's there.

538
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:12,166
-Copley.
-Copley?

539
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:14,333
They're coming back.
They want all of us.

540
00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:15,583
You stay here.

541
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:17,375
Wait for my signal.

542
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,833
What signal?

543
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,041
- What does that even mean?
- You'll know it when it comes.

544
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:28,708
And, by the way,
it's not always like this now.

545
00:55:29,458 --> 00:55:31,291
Big wounds take longer to heal.

546
00:55:31,916 --> 00:55:32,875
Sure.

547
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:35,750
<i>Bravo Team approaching church.</i>

548
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:44,500
Go, go, go.

549
00:56:38,541 --> 00:56:39,916
Come on! Move! Move!

550
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,291
We've gotta get out there!

551
00:56:42,375 --> 00:56:43,416
We need to help her.

552
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,958
No, that's not the signal.

553
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:03,333
Mr. Keane,

554
00:57:04,791 --> 00:57:07,000
I strongly recommend
that we leave right now.

555
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:18,791
Come on!

556
00:57:20,041 --> 00:57:21,000
Let's move!

557
00:57:21,083 --> 00:57:22,458
Wait for the signal.

558
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:24,416
How the hell can you even tell?

559
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:29,291
Let's go!

560
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:45,625
Andy did all this herself?

561
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:49,291
Yeah. That woman has forgotten
more ways to kill

562
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:50,875
than entire armies will ever learn.

563
00:57:51,291 --> 00:57:53,416
Who are they? How'd they find you?

564
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,791
I don't know. Let's go!

565
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:29,666
Nicolo.

566
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:31,250
- Quiet.
- Nicolo, wake up.

567
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:33,041
- I said...
- I know what you said.

568
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:34,583
What are you gonna do? Kill me?

569
00:58:34,916 --> 00:58:36,041
Wake up.

570
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:36,958
Wake up!

571
00:58:37,041 --> 00:58:38,041
I'm here.

572
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:39,791
I'm here.

573
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,166
Wherever here is.

574
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:44,333
In an armored van.

575
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,250
They used gas.

576
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:48,083
I told you, shut up!

577
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:49,458
I need to know he's okay.

578
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:50,833
That's sweet.

579
00:58:51,708 --> 00:58:53,083
What is he? Your boyfriend?

580
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:57,583
You're a child.

581
00:58:58,583 --> 00:58:59,416
An infant.

582
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:01,833
Your mocking is thus infantile.

583
00:59:01,916 --> 00:59:03,458
He's not my boyfriend.

584
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:06,750
This man is more to me than you can dream.

585
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,333
He's the moon when I'm lost in darkness
and warmth when I shiver in cold.

586
00:59:11,416 --> 00:59:13,875
And his kiss still thrills me,
even after a millennia.

587
00:59:15,125 --> 00:59:19,083
His heart overflows with the kindness
of which this world is not worthy of.

588
00:59:19,166 --> 00:59:22,791
I love this man beyond measure and reason.
He's not my boyfriend.

589
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:28,791
He's all and he's more.

590
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:31,916
You're an incurable romantic.

591
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:58,666
I don't suppose it would be possible
to get these chains off of us?

592
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:01,208
Get 'em out! Get 'em out!
Get 'em on the plane now!

593
01:00:01,291 --> 01:00:02,375
I guess not.

594
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:07,666
We are usually
a better judge of character.

595
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:12,250
I suppose you are taking us
to the person who paid for your betrayal.

596
01:00:13,666 --> 01:00:15,041
It's a nice plane.

597
01:00:16,541 --> 01:00:17,875
There's a TV, Joe.

598
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:19,458
Champagne?

599
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:39,000
What is this place?

600
01:01:39,791 --> 01:01:41,000
An abandoned mine.

601
01:01:42,875 --> 01:01:45,750
We stumbled on it
during the Baussenque Wars.

602
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:47,666
1150s maybe?

603
01:01:50,041 --> 01:01:51,625
I used to keep my stuff here.

604
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:00,375
Here...

605
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:34,000
Is this a Rodin?

606
01:02:35,208 --> 01:02:36,125
Yeah.

607
01:02:36,208 --> 01:02:39,333
This is an honest-to-God Rodin.

608
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,333
Wait.

609
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:43,291
Did you know him?

610
01:02:43,375 --> 01:02:45,875
Probably biblically.

611
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:52,791
Get to work finding Copley.

612
01:02:53,708 --> 01:02:54,916
He's got Nicky and Joe.

613
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:05,083
It can hardly be unique
if they can make another copy.

614
01:03:06,125 --> 01:03:07,041
I've got to go.

615
01:03:12,208 --> 01:03:14,208
Gentlemen, welcome.

616
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:17,208
I am truly honored to meet you.

617
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:19,375
Together, we shall do such things.

618
01:03:19,458 --> 01:03:20,791
What they are yet, I know not,

619
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:23,083
but they shall be
the terrors of the Earth.

620
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:24,916
Or, um, rather the saviors.

621
01:03:26,875 --> 01:03:27,708
Lear...

622
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:29,666
Shakespeare.

623
01:03:30,666 --> 01:03:32,875
Um, can we take the cuffs off?

624
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:34,666
No, sir. We can't.

625
01:03:35,958 --> 01:03:38,708
My apologies.
Let's get off on the right foot, shall we?

626
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:41,625
I'm Steven Merrick,
youngest CEO in pharma.

627
01:03:42,333 --> 01:03:44,250
Our work here is all about balance.

628
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:48,875
How do we push the scientific frontiers
whilst also turning a little profit?

629
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:51,958
There's your balance, asshole.

630
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
- Mr. Merrick?
- Yes, yes, yes.

631
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:56,958
Watch it.

632
01:03:58,083 --> 01:04:01,625
Mr. Copley provided me
with footage of your unique talent,

633
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:05,625
but I prefer my evidence
to be indisputable.

634
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,625
No!

635
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:09,500
Mr. Merrick!

636
01:04:09,583 --> 01:04:11,958
God damn it!

637
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:13,250
Shit!

638
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:18,916
What do you see?

639
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:21,750
The Nobel Prize.

640
01:04:23,166 --> 01:04:24,833
And a fair few quid to boot.

641
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:30,916
We brought a cancer drug
to the market last quarter.

642
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,583
It's already saved
hundreds of thousands of lives.

643
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:38,000
Yet, in development,
it killed a quarter of a million lab mice.

644
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:41,833
Now, I didn't ask
for their little permissions.

645
01:04:41,916 --> 01:04:43,333
I'm not gonna ask for yours.

646
01:04:43,833 --> 01:04:45,583
He thinks you're a mouse, Nicky.

647
01:04:46,166 --> 01:04:48,500
There's genetic code inside you

648
01:04:48,583 --> 01:04:50,750
which could help
every human being on Earth.

649
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:53,208
We're morally obliged to take it.

650
01:04:53,291 --> 01:04:54,333
What?

651
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:57,333
- What is that? Wait!
- Hey!

652
01:05:02,041 --> 01:05:02,875
No!

653
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:09,333
I'll keep you informed of my progress.

654
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:11,375
Yes. Yes, you do that.

655
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:20,083
Mr. Merrick...

656
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:25,041
this is about science,
not profits...

657
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:26,041
or sadism.

658
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:28,875
You owe me two more.

659
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:40,166
Come on, Book.
You've been working on that for hours.

660
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,666
He's a security expert.

661
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:44,125
He leaves no footprints.
It's gonna take time.

662
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:45,458
You got a satellite link?

663
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:48,375
Yeah.

664
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:50,958
Follow the money.

665
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:52,666
Whoever he's working for, maybe?

666
01:05:54,333 --> 01:05:55,875
That's how we track militants.

667
01:06:05,333 --> 01:06:07,000
I'm sure you already tried that.

668
01:06:07,083 --> 01:06:08,958
Yeah, it won't hurt to try again.

669
01:06:10,958 --> 01:06:12,458
You know how it works, Nile.

670
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,208
Get some sleep while you can.

671
01:06:15,291 --> 01:06:17,041
I brought you a change of clothes.

672
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:23,000
I'm going out for a bit.

673
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:27,500
- Are you all right, boss?
- Yeah.

674
01:06:48,875 --> 01:06:51,916
Just because we keep living
doesn't mean we stop hurting.

675
01:07:01,208 --> 01:07:02,166
Why us?

676
01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:03,958
Yeah.

677
01:07:07,083 --> 01:07:08,708
That way madness lies.

678
01:07:09,208 --> 01:07:11,416
I thought you were
the brains of this outfit.

679
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,416
Tell you what I do wonder...

680
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:21,958
is why you?

681
01:07:23,541 --> 01:07:24,541
And why now?

682
01:07:28,583 --> 01:07:29,791
How old is Andy?

683
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:33,125
Well, she says she...
she doesn't remember.

684
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,625
And she may not. I don't know.

685
01:07:38,375 --> 01:07:40,791
But what I do know
is she was alone for a long time

686
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:42,291
before she found anyone like her.

687
01:07:42,791 --> 01:07:43,875
A very long time.

688
01:07:44,458 --> 01:07:46,500
What about you? You have someone?

689
01:07:49,208 --> 01:07:50,375
Just my family.

690
01:07:57,833 --> 01:07:59,291
I had three sons.

691
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:03,583
And the youngest one, Jean-Pierre...

692
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:07,083
was the last one to die.

693
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,625
He was 42 when...

694
01:08:10,166 --> 01:08:11,708
cancer took him.

695
01:08:13,833 --> 01:08:15,583
The only way is forward now.

696
01:08:15,666 --> 01:08:16,625
What do you mean?

697
01:08:17,208 --> 01:08:20,291
You'll always and forever
be the young woman right there...

698
01:08:22,416 --> 01:08:24,000
but everyone around you,

699
01:08:24,083 --> 01:08:25,375
everyone you love...

700
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:27,833
is gonna grow old,

701
01:08:29,708 --> 01:08:30,750
is gonna...

702
01:08:30,833 --> 01:08:32,708
is gonna suffer and is gonna die.

703
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,375
And if you try to...

704
01:08:42,458 --> 01:08:44,333
if you try to touch their lives...

705
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:47,416
well, they will get to learn your secret.

706
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:51,000
<i>They will beg you to share it with them,</i>
<i>and you won't be able to.</i>

707
01:08:53,083 --> 01:08:55,000
And they won't believe you, of course.

708
01:08:58,916 --> 01:09:00,208
And they will tell you...

709
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:03,416
that you don't love them.

710
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,791
<i>That your love is weak...</i>

711
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:09,541
or selfish.

712
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:12,791
And you will never forget...

713
01:09:15,041 --> 01:09:16,000
the hate...

714
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:18,250
and despair in their eyes.

715
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:25,500
And you will know what it is to lose...

716
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,458
everyone you've ever loved.

717
01:10:33,708 --> 01:10:35,125
Do you have a bathroom?

718
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:37,291
No.

719
01:10:41,333 --> 01:10:42,583
But we have a storeroom.

720
01:10:45,958 --> 01:10:47,208
Do you need help?

721
01:11:10,083 --> 01:11:11,958
Stitches would be better, but...

722
01:11:12,041 --> 01:11:13,250
this will help.

723
01:11:14,416 --> 01:11:15,416
You haven't asked.

724
01:11:16,416 --> 01:11:17,750
Your business is yours.

725
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:22,458
You need help.

726
01:11:23,541 --> 01:11:24,791
What does it matter why?

727
01:11:27,291 --> 01:11:29,166
Today, I put this on your wound.

728
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,125
Tomorrow...

729
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,250
you help someone up when they fall.

730
01:11:37,291 --> 01:11:38,708
We're not meant to be alone.

731
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:46,500
There.

732
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:49,833
This should do.

733
01:11:58,541 --> 01:11:59,458
Thank you.

734
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:34,208
<i>Andromache, help me!</i>

735
01:12:34,916 --> 01:12:36,291
Why won't it stop?

736
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:38,875
This can't be happening.

737
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:39,791
Lykon.

738
01:12:41,958 --> 01:12:42,833
It's time.

739
01:12:43,875 --> 01:12:44,958
It's impossible.

740
01:12:46,208 --> 01:12:47,916
It...

741
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,083
It's time.

742
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:08,416
How long will the testing take?

743
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,875
Until we have results we can replicate.

744
01:13:16,208 --> 01:13:18,208
Do you feel the wound trying to close?

745
01:13:20,125 --> 01:13:21,708
You don't need them for that.

746
01:13:22,375 --> 01:13:24,708
You've got the samples,
blood, tissue, DNA.

747
01:13:25,291 --> 01:13:27,833
Well, you know
the concept of proprietary data,

748
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:29,666
and they're the product.

749
01:13:31,416 --> 01:13:34,458
They go in the vault.
They stay there under lock and key.

750
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:37,708
For... ever?

751
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:40,500
We can't have them strolling back out
into the world...

752
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:43,166
into my competitors' laps.

753
01:13:43,875 --> 01:13:46,666
If this takes years, maybe decades,

754
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:48,416
what does it matter to them?

755
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:53,416
If we can unlock their genetic code,
the world will be begging us for the key.

756
01:13:55,041 --> 01:13:55,875
Remarkable.

757
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:01,500
You will not be able
to give him what he wants.

758
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:03,375
You think I go too far?

759
01:14:04,166 --> 01:14:05,833
That I am unethical?

760
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:07,666
I would say immoral.

761
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:11,625
I believe this can change the world.

762
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,750
A fine justification.

763
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:16,666
I've heard it so many times before.

764
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:35,375
As much as I like watching you sleep,
I'm glad you're awake.

765
01:14:36,666 --> 01:14:37,500
Bed head?

766
01:14:41,583 --> 01:14:42,750
Nicely tousled.

767
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:51,416
Do you know, I was thinking about Malta.

768
01:14:53,041 --> 01:14:54,208
What time in Malta?

769
01:14:57,458 --> 01:14:59,875
That time in Malta.

770
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:06,333
We should go back there.

771
01:15:08,333 --> 01:15:09,583
That would be nice.

772
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:43,666
Your mom and brother?

773
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:45,375
You have my phone?

774
01:15:56,958 --> 01:15:58,291
Where's your father?

775
01:15:59,916 --> 01:16:01,708
Killed in action when I was 11.

776
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:07,041
Here...

777
01:16:13,166 --> 01:16:16,083
My mom, she was drowning after he died.

778
01:16:17,041 --> 01:16:18,291
South Side of Chicago,

779
01:16:18,375 --> 01:16:20,791
a million different ways
we could have went left.

780
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:23,750
She fought for us.

781
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:25,958
Never backed down.

782
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,791
Never let us back down either.

783
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:33,125
You come from warriors.

784
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:35,208
Yeah.

785
01:16:36,375 --> 01:16:37,291
I do.

786
01:16:40,791 --> 01:16:42,958
I can't remember
what my mother looked like.

787
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:47,416
Or my sisters.

788
01:16:51,166 --> 01:16:52,041
None of them.

789
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:55,541
Time steals it all away, I guess.

790
01:16:57,416 --> 01:16:59,166
It's not what time steals...

791
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:02,583
it's what it leaves behind.

792
01:17:06,208 --> 01:17:07,416
Things you can't forget.

793
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:11,916
I gave up searching for her.

794
01:17:16,666 --> 01:17:19,041
I made Quynh a promise and I broke it.

795
01:17:27,208 --> 01:17:28,791
I'm getting Joe and Nicky back.

796
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,583
Whatever it takes.

797
01:17:36,791 --> 01:17:38,083
"Whatever it takes"?

798
01:17:43,416 --> 01:17:44,291
Yes.

799
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:46,375
Guys, I found something.

800
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:48,541
An address just outside of London.

801
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:56,166
We gotta go.

802
01:18:34,625 --> 01:18:35,750
Go scout the back.

803
01:18:45,708 --> 01:18:47,208
I can't do this.

804
01:18:47,708 --> 01:18:48,625
Yes, you can.

805
01:18:49,041 --> 01:18:51,375
I mean, I'm not doing this.

806
01:18:55,458 --> 01:18:56,750
You're one of us now.

807
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:58,958
We would do the same for you.

808
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:01,583
-I never even had a choice.
-None of us had a choice.

809
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:03,458
There isn't a choice.

810
01:19:04,333 --> 01:19:05,541
The day I died,

811
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:09,458
I killed the guy that killed me.

812
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:13,583
They try to condition us, you know?

813
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,083
Thousands of hours of training.

814
01:19:16,166 --> 01:19:17,666
Two shots, quick kill.

815
01:19:20,291 --> 01:19:22,166
But they can't teach you how
to live with it.

816
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:24,208
You've gotta feel it, Nile.

817
01:19:25,541 --> 01:19:26,375
Every one.

818
01:19:27,041 --> 01:19:28,708
I saw what you did in that church.

819
01:19:30,583 --> 01:19:32,208
All those bodies.

820
01:19:33,291 --> 01:19:34,833
Is that supposed to be me?

821
01:19:35,875 --> 01:19:38,458
Is that what we're supposed to do,
and we don't even know why?

822
01:19:38,541 --> 01:19:41,666
You think knowing
is gonna make you sleep better at night?

823
01:19:42,666 --> 01:19:43,916
I can't be that.

824
01:19:46,916 --> 01:19:48,250
My family,

825
01:19:49,708 --> 01:19:51,750
they're gonna get old and I won't,

826
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:54,833
but it'll be years
before they realize that.

827
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:59,208
I still have time with them.

828
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:04,250
Here.

829
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:07,791
Take the car,

830
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:10,708
and when you ditch it, ditch the weapons.

831
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:14,875
You gonna be okay?

832
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:17,166
Always.

833
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:31,458
Where's Nile?

834
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:34,916
You and me, Book. Now and always.

835
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:44,416
<i>Guildford station</i>
<i>in one mile.</i>

836
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:15,291
Empty?

837
01:21:22,625 --> 01:21:23,541
Shit.

838
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:26,333
Andy.

839
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:00,625
Where are they?

840
01:22:05,375 --> 01:22:06,791
Andromache the Scythian.

841
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:08,916
The eternal warrior.

842
01:22:10,541 --> 01:22:12,041
-Book?
<i>-</i>I'm right here.

843
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:21,916
Where are Joe and Nicky?

844
01:22:27,583 --> 01:22:29,125
What are you doing?

845
01:22:29,208 --> 01:22:30,166
Calm down.

846
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:31,916
-What are you doing?
-Andy, calm down!

847
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:34,208
No!

848
01:22:35,666 --> 01:22:38,833
Shh.

849
01:22:38,916 --> 01:22:40,750
You set us up?

850
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:44,000
Please listen.

851
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:46,500
When my wife died,

852
01:22:47,291 --> 01:22:48,833
I devoted myself to your work.

853
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:52,541
I learned your secret history,

854
01:22:52,625 --> 01:22:53,916
written in the margins...

855
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:56,750
passed on like legend.

856
01:22:57,666 --> 01:23:01,583
What was dismissed as a myth was,
in fact, immortality.

857
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:05,500
You could help end... needless suffering.

858
01:23:15,916 --> 01:23:18,208
Humanity needs you to share your gifts.

859
01:23:18,875 --> 01:23:22,916
Humanity can screw itself.

860
01:23:26,625 --> 01:23:29,291
- Andy...
- Don't, you fucking coward.

861
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:34,958
Why?

862
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:37,458
Why, Book?

863
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:39,666
-Andy, listen...
-Why?

864
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,375
If Merrick can discover
how we keep living,

865
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:46,791
he might find a way how to end it.

866
01:23:51,583 --> 01:23:52,541
Hey.

867
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:54,750
That's what you wanted.

868
01:23:55,791 --> 01:23:57,875
Book. What have you done?

869
01:24:02,041 --> 01:24:03,708
Not like this, Book.

870
01:24:07,708 --> 01:24:09,208
What's going on?

871
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:10,875
You're still bleeding.

872
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:13,583
You're still bleeding.

873
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:15,750
What? Shit.

874
01:24:15,833 --> 01:24:16,791
She's not healing.

875
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,000
-What?
-Look at this. She's not healing.

876
01:24:19,083 --> 01:24:21,666
Go get something. Go on! Go on!

877
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:25,458
Andy, look at me.

878
01:24:26,208 --> 01:24:27,125
Look at me.

879
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:29,541
Why didn't you tell me?

880
01:24:33,416 --> 01:24:35,458
It wouldn't have changed anything.

881
01:24:36,875 --> 01:24:37,916
Hurry up!

882
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,916
Come on.

883
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:40,875
Careful.

884
01:24:41,666 --> 01:24:43,458
Get her out of here.

885
01:24:45,541 --> 01:24:46,375
Secure him.

886
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:47,875
Nice work, Copley.

887
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,041
Look at you.

888
01:24:52,458 --> 01:24:54,416
She's wounded. Gunshot.

889
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:55,708
Why isn't she healing?

890
01:24:56,583 --> 01:24:57,416
I don't know.

891
01:24:59,208 --> 01:25:00,166
She's not immortal.

892
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:05,000
-What do you mean, "not immortal?"
-I mean it's gone.

893
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:14,916
You're a bloody mess.

894
01:25:19,416 --> 01:25:20,583
Now, how old are you?

895
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:25,583
Come closer and I'll tell you.

896
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:30,458
Let's get them home.

897
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,375
- Let her go.
- Cover me.

898
01:25:33,458 --> 01:25:35,708
- No! No!
- Let her go!

899
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,375
Get her up.

900
01:25:41,916 --> 01:25:42,875
No!

901
01:25:44,583 --> 01:25:46,458
I'm sorry, Andy.

902
01:25:48,125 --> 01:25:49,375
I'm sorry.

903
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:52,000
Hold him still.

904
01:25:54,875 --> 01:25:58,000
Mr. Merrick, look. If it's true and
she's somehow not immortal anymore,

905
01:25:58,083 --> 01:25:59,958
then she might not survive the testing.

906
01:26:00,041 --> 01:26:03,708
-This will be murder.
-As if the CIA never disappeared anyone.

907
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:06,083
As if they never conducted
covert research.

908
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:07,000
No.

909
01:26:08,041 --> 01:26:09,458
No, this is not what we agreed.

910
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:11,916
We don't stop.

911
01:26:22,416 --> 01:26:23,375
Andy.

912
01:26:25,208 --> 01:26:26,666
What happened?

913
01:26:27,666 --> 01:26:28,958
She's not healing.

914
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:32,250
I killed her.

915
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:42,208
I need to get a line in her
and stop the bleeding.

916
01:26:42,625 --> 01:26:44,500
Keep her alive at all costs.

917
01:26:45,208 --> 01:26:48,541
Don't you see? Between Sudan and now,
something's changed.

918
01:26:49,041 --> 01:26:51,458
- Find out what.
- This will stabilize her,

919
01:26:51,541 --> 01:26:53,166
but I have to stitch her

920
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:55,375
- and give her antibiotics.
- Good.

921
01:26:55,916 --> 01:26:57,208
All things die.

922
01:26:59,291 --> 01:27:00,125
What was that?

923
01:27:00,208 --> 01:27:02,500
Everything has to die, Mr. Merrick.

924
01:27:05,083 --> 01:27:06,666
The only reason we haven't...

925
01:27:07,666 --> 01:27:09,125
is that it's not our time yet.

926
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:13,500
If it's now Andromache's,
nothing you can do will stop it.

927
01:27:13,583 --> 01:27:16,208
You'd be surprised by
what my products can do.

928
01:27:19,291 --> 01:27:22,125
I will carve slices off you for years
to get what I want.

929
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,250
Your time is coming.

930
01:27:25,666 --> 01:27:26,750
As is yours.

931
01:27:31,333 --> 01:27:33,583
I expect results!

932
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:38,333
Andy.

933
01:27:49,875 --> 01:27:51,291
Are you Copley?

934
01:27:51,375 --> 01:27:53,541
-He sent you to finish me off.
-Who?

935
01:27:55,833 --> 01:27:57,958
Where's Andy and Booker?

936
01:27:58,041 --> 01:27:59,291
Who are you?

937
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:04,458
Son of a bitch!

938
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:06,833
You're another one.

939
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:09,791
Yeah. I'm new.

940
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,833
-Where are they?
-They're in a lab...

941
01:28:13,250 --> 01:28:14,083
being tested.

942
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:17,166
Tortured.

943
01:28:18,083 --> 01:28:19,000
Merrick...

944
01:28:19,416 --> 01:28:21,291
he only cares about her immortality,

945
01:28:23,083 --> 01:28:24,416
not what she's done with it.

946
01:28:24,916 --> 01:28:26,166
"What she's done with it"?

947
01:28:26,916 --> 01:28:29,208
Montenegro, 1916.

948
01:28:29,291 --> 01:28:31,916
She saved a family of refugees
whose daughter would discover

949
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,166
the technique
for the early detection of diabetes.

950
01:28:35,416 --> 01:28:36,500
This one...

951
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:41,000
Her grandson would save 317 people
from the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.

952
01:28:41,666 --> 01:28:42,625
This guy...

953
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:46,333
This man prevented
an accidental nuclear exchange in 1978

954
01:28:46,416 --> 01:28:48,833
and likely saved civilization as a result.

955
01:28:51,041 --> 01:28:51,875
The famous...

956
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:55,041
and the unknown names.

957
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,250
She saves a life,

958
01:29:00,333 --> 01:29:03,291
two, three generations later,
we reap the benefits.

959
01:29:08,333 --> 01:29:09,375
She's in it.

960
01:29:11,375 --> 01:29:12,416
She can't see it.

961
01:29:16,875 --> 01:29:18,083
But you could.

962
01:29:18,875 --> 01:29:21,125
You could and you gave them up.

963
01:29:21,958 --> 01:29:23,750
I thought it could be the end of disease.

964
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:27,666
I thought it could be
the end of suffering.

965
01:29:33,708 --> 01:29:35,041
She couldn't talk...

966
01:29:36,708 --> 01:29:37,625
at the end...

967
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:39,125
my wife.

968
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,291
She couldn't breathe.

969
01:29:44,833 --> 01:29:46,041
I couldn't do...

970
01:29:46,666 --> 01:29:47,583
anything.

971
01:29:50,416 --> 01:29:52,083
It was supposed to be a gift...

972
01:29:53,916 --> 01:29:54,750
to the world.

973
01:29:55,166 --> 01:29:57,041
It wasn't your gift to give.

974
01:30:03,375 --> 01:30:05,833
Why would the immortality end?

975
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:07,416
What?

976
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:09,791
She wouldn't stop bleeding.

977
01:30:12,458 --> 01:30:13,583
Is she alive?

978
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:16,291
I know where they are.

979
01:30:52,416 --> 01:30:53,625
There's no cameras here.

980
01:30:54,708 --> 01:30:56,375
That's how he gets people
in and out unseen.

981
01:30:56,875 --> 01:30:59,708
- How many shooters on site?
- At least 30.

982
01:31:00,375 --> 01:31:02,791
Their boss, Keane, is ex-Special Forces.

983
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:05,625
What kind of CEO rolls around
with his own personal army?

984
01:31:06,041 --> 01:31:07,958
These days?

985
01:31:08,458 --> 01:31:09,291
Most of them.

986
01:31:09,958 --> 01:31:11,958
-What are you doing?
-I'm gonna make this right.

987
01:31:12,041 --> 01:31:13,625
Your dying won't do that.

988
01:31:14,208 --> 01:31:16,583
But I'm supposed to let you
walk in there by yourself?

989
01:31:16,666 --> 01:31:17,791
Out of the two of us,

990
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:19,708
I'm the one
who will walk out of there again,

991
01:31:19,791 --> 01:31:20,958
one way or another.

992
01:31:25,958 --> 01:31:27,000
You got me here.

993
01:31:32,791 --> 01:31:34,791
There's a private lab on the 15th floor.

994
01:31:35,958 --> 01:31:36,958
It's empty.

995
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:39,625
This will get you access.

996
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:48,125
You should get out of here
before the noise starts.

997
01:31:55,333 --> 01:31:56,541
Good luck, Ms. Freeman.

998
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:38,458
Floor's closed. How'd you get up here?

999
01:32:38,791 --> 01:32:40,166
Sorry, I was just looking...

1000
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:41,875
Hands! Let me see your hands.

1001
01:32:47,458 --> 01:32:48,958
Zero, this is Alpha 2-2.

1002
01:32:51,333 --> 01:32:52,416
Sir.

1003
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:54,750
Zero. Send.

1004
01:32:54,833 --> 01:32:57,333
<i>We've had an intruder.</i>
<i>Target is down.</i>

1005
01:32:59,416 --> 01:33:01,333
See if you can get an ID off the body.

1006
01:33:10,125 --> 01:33:11,500
Shit!

1007
01:33:11,583 --> 01:33:13,166
TAC teams, find Merrick now!

1008
01:33:19,958 --> 01:33:23,125
-You selfish piece of shit!
-Joe, leave it. Please!

1009
01:33:23,208 --> 01:33:25,416
What do you know
of the weight of all these years alone?

1010
01:33:26,708 --> 01:33:28,916
- You're a very pathetic man, Booker.
- Joe, Stop.

1011
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,750
You and Nicky
always had each other, right?

1012
01:33:31,458 --> 01:33:32,791
And all we had...

1013
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:34,333
was our grief.

1014
01:33:34,416 --> 01:33:36,583
Well, now you have even more.

1015
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:46,708
-Who the hell are you?
-Where's the lab?

1016
01:33:59,583 --> 01:34:00,583
Shit!

1017
01:34:00,666 --> 01:34:02,166
There's another one!

1018
01:34:05,708 --> 01:34:08,208
She's going for the rest of them.
Doctor's lab, now!

1019
01:34:08,291 --> 01:34:11,000
I'm locking you down in the penthouse
until this is over.

1020
01:34:24,958 --> 01:34:25,791
Nile.

1021
01:34:27,458 --> 01:34:28,458
Behind you!

1022
01:34:32,208 --> 01:34:33,208
Nile!

1023
01:34:36,833 --> 01:34:39,458
There's four shooters at the door
and more coming.

1024
01:34:46,708 --> 01:34:47,541
Andy.

1025
01:34:54,333 --> 01:34:55,708
Immortal or not,

1026
01:34:56,458 --> 01:34:57,791
you made a promise.

1027
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,166
Whatever it takes.

1028
01:35:02,166 --> 01:35:03,583
I've seen it, Andy.

1029
01:35:04,916 --> 01:35:06,541
I know all the good you've done.

1030
01:35:18,041 --> 01:35:19,083
You came back.

1031
01:35:22,208 --> 01:35:23,083
Yeah.

1032
01:35:25,875 --> 01:35:27,166
No, just leave me here.

1033
01:35:27,666 --> 01:35:29,208
No man left behind.

1034
01:35:29,291 --> 01:35:31,791
There's always a first time.
He's nothing but a traitor. That's...

1035
01:35:31,875 --> 01:35:34,125
Stop! This is not the time for it.

1036
01:35:35,458 --> 01:35:37,916
We don't get a say in when it ends.
We never have.

1037
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:40,291
But we can control how we live.

1038
01:35:41,916 --> 01:35:43,041
And to be honest, Book,

1039
01:35:44,416 --> 01:35:45,291
you and I,

1040
01:35:45,958 --> 01:35:47,666
we've been doing a shit job of it.

1041
01:35:48,083 --> 01:35:48,958
Now, get up.

1042
01:35:49,041 --> 01:35:50,125
Let's go.

1043
01:35:50,791 --> 01:35:53,833
We stop Merrick here and now
or he never stops coming after us.

1044
01:36:02,333 --> 01:36:03,166
Andy.

1045
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:05,375
Are you sure?

1046
01:36:05,791 --> 01:36:07,041
This changes nothing.

1047
01:36:07,833 --> 01:36:09,500
We walk out of here like always.

1048
01:36:10,375 --> 01:36:11,208
Together.

1049
01:36:12,375 --> 01:36:13,958
Let's get this motherfucker.

1050
01:36:31,916 --> 01:36:32,916
Cover Andy.

1051
01:37:00,041 --> 01:37:02,250
Andy!

1052
01:38:05,083 --> 01:38:06,625
Man! Andy!

1053
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:16,750
Joe, Nicky, we're moving out!

1054
01:38:17,208 --> 01:38:19,666
Assault team, move! You two, flank.

1055
01:39:18,166 --> 01:39:19,791
<i>What's your location?</i>

1056
01:39:21,291 --> 01:39:22,666
Enough of this shit.

1057
01:39:36,166 --> 01:39:37,875
Let's go. Andy.

1058
01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:42,291
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1059
01:39:47,166 --> 01:39:48,416
Shit! Jammed!

1060
01:39:53,708 --> 01:39:54,750
Where's Andy?

1061
01:39:57,416 --> 01:39:58,958
<i>Hold at the bridge.</i>

1062
01:39:59,625 --> 01:40:01,416
- Roger that.
- Fuck.

1063
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,041
Where's Merrick?

1064
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:50,750
Penthouse.

1065
01:40:54,625 --> 01:40:56,750
What do you think? Oslo, '67?

1066
01:40:56,833 --> 01:40:59,333
São Paulo, '34. Nile's with me.

1067
01:40:59,416 --> 01:41:01,416
What happened in São Paulo in 1934?

1068
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:02,750
1834.

1069
01:41:03,458 --> 01:41:04,375
You'll see.

1070
01:41:13,708 --> 01:41:15,500
First team, hold the hall.

1071
01:41:24,208 --> 01:41:25,125
First team.

1072
01:41:34,083 --> 01:41:35,125
Wait for the signal.

1073
01:41:35,958 --> 01:41:37,500
This gonna be like the last signal?

1074
01:41:39,166 --> 01:41:40,541
Go big or go home.

1075
01:41:43,208 --> 01:41:44,125
Keane.

1076
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:48,416
Keane, how many more do we have coming?

1077
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:50,625
This is it. Dig in.

1078
01:42:00,041 --> 01:42:01,041
I'll make the entry.

1079
01:42:01,666 --> 01:42:03,041
Stay tight to me, okay?

1080
01:42:03,666 --> 01:42:04,666
I'll protect you.

1081
01:42:07,583 --> 01:42:08,833
I go through first.

1082
01:42:08,916 --> 01:42:10,291
I always go first.

1083
01:42:10,375 --> 01:42:12,416
Andy, put on the damn armor.

1084
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:15,416
It's like Nicky said,
"If it's my time, it's my time."

1085
01:42:17,166 --> 01:42:18,500
If this doesn't work out,

1086
01:42:20,458 --> 01:42:22,333
next time, you go first.

1087
01:42:32,666 --> 01:42:35,083
What the hell are they waiting for?

1088
01:42:36,791 --> 01:42:37,958
Shit!

1089
01:43:09,791 --> 01:43:11,041
You shot Nicky.

1090
01:43:11,666 --> 01:43:13,208
You shouldn't have done that.

1091
01:43:28,583 --> 01:43:30,333
The elevator is going down!

1092
01:43:30,791 --> 01:43:32,583
-Merrick is getting away!
-Go!

1093
01:43:33,375 --> 01:43:34,416
I'll stay with Andy.

1094
01:43:49,041 --> 01:43:49,875
You okay?

1095
01:43:49,958 --> 01:43:51,375
Yeah, I'm fine.

1096
01:43:53,375 --> 01:43:54,375
It just hurts.

1097
01:43:58,458 --> 01:43:59,958
Actually, everything hurts.

1098
01:44:01,666 --> 01:44:03,541
Well, wait until tomorrow.

1099
01:44:09,458 --> 01:44:10,375
Can't wait.

1100
01:44:20,208 --> 01:44:22,916
I think you showed up
when I lost my immortality.

1101
01:44:23,708 --> 01:44:25,458
So I could see what it was like.

1102
01:44:26,916 --> 01:44:28,125
So I could remember.

1103
01:44:29,208 --> 01:44:30,125
Remember?

1104
01:44:31,291 --> 01:44:32,333
Remember what it...

1105
01:44:35,166 --> 01:44:37,583
what it was like to feel unbreakable.

1106
01:44:38,583 --> 01:44:39,583
Remarkable.

1107
01:44:44,875 --> 01:44:47,208
You reminded me there are people...

1108
01:44:48,583 --> 01:44:50,125
still worth fighting for.

1109
01:45:00,125 --> 01:45:03,458
I know how I want to spend the time
I've got left.

1110
01:45:04,708 --> 01:45:07,208
You're gonna spend it with us, Andy.

1111
01:45:08,916 --> 01:45:11,208
You selfish little bitch!

1112
01:45:11,291 --> 01:45:12,708
I will kill her!

1113
01:45:17,875 --> 01:45:20,041
All the lives you could save.

1114
01:45:22,958 --> 01:45:25,958
Don't you see what we could do here?

1115
01:45:26,041 --> 01:45:27,500
You are priceless.

1116
01:45:29,333 --> 01:45:30,166
Hey, Nile.

1117
01:45:32,666 --> 01:45:34,208
Do you think he speaks Russian?

1118
01:45:55,458 --> 01:45:56,916
Play dead, motherfucker.

1119
01:46:06,083 --> 01:46:06,958
Nile?

1120
01:46:12,291 --> 01:46:13,125
Hey.

1121
01:46:17,666 --> 01:46:18,666
She's okay.

1122
01:46:25,791 --> 01:46:26,625
Come on.

1123
01:46:28,416 --> 01:46:29,666
Faster than the elevator.

1124
01:46:33,458 --> 01:46:34,666
It's okay, Nile.

1125
01:46:36,333 --> 01:46:38,125
Give me your hand.

1126
01:46:59,208 --> 01:47:00,208
Let's go.

1127
01:48:12,625 --> 01:48:13,833
How's it going?

1128
01:48:14,458 --> 01:48:15,708
They're still deciding.

1129
01:48:19,083 --> 01:48:22,000
There's not much to decide.
It's not like they can kill me.

1130
01:48:28,791 --> 01:48:30,291
She gave it back?

1131
01:48:30,833 --> 01:48:31,666
Yeah.

1132
01:48:34,041 --> 01:48:35,250
Talked to Copley.

1133
01:48:37,333 --> 01:48:38,541
Said he could fix it.

1134
01:48:41,375 --> 01:48:43,708
Make it look like I was killed in action.

1135
01:48:46,416 --> 01:48:48,958
My family will mourn, but...

1136
01:48:52,208 --> 01:48:53,708
...they'll be able to move on.

1137
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:58,458
It's just like what we did with my dad.

1138
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:04,291
I just really want to hear my mom's voice
one more time.

1139
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:09,500
You're a good kid, Nile.

1140
01:49:12,125 --> 01:49:14,250
You're gonna be great for the team.

1141
01:49:38,458 --> 01:49:39,833
There's got to be a price.

1142
01:49:44,750 --> 01:49:47,333
One hundred years from today,
they'll meet you here.

1143
01:49:50,041 --> 01:49:51,333
Till then, you're alone.

1144
01:49:59,250 --> 01:50:00,791
I hoped for less, but...

1145
01:50:03,125 --> 01:50:04,375
I expected more.

1146
01:50:05,208 --> 01:50:07,625
Nile was gonna let you off
with an apology.

1147
01:50:13,291 --> 01:50:14,666
Just give her some time.

1148
01:50:26,250 --> 01:50:27,375
I'm gonna miss you.

1149
01:50:54,125 --> 01:50:55,291
Um...

1150
01:50:55,791 --> 01:50:57,166
I won't see you again.

1151
01:51:02,083 --> 01:51:03,458
Have a little faith, Book.

1152
01:51:52,125 --> 01:51:55,708
This is only what I've found
going back the last 150 years or so.

1153
01:51:59,583 --> 01:52:01,333
When you think about how old you are,

1154
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:06,458
the good you've done for humanity
becomes exponential.

1155
01:52:08,333 --> 01:52:10,208
Maybe this is the why, Andy.

1156
01:52:17,208 --> 01:52:20,625
It's nearly impossible to disappear
in the world we live in today.

1157
01:52:22,416 --> 01:52:25,875
There are too many people like you
who can bend it to your will.

1158
01:52:27,375 --> 01:52:28,958
Too many with bad intentions.

1159
01:52:30,875 --> 01:52:34,250
We don't have all the answers,
but we do have purpose.

1160
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,291
And you're going to help us.

1161
01:52:43,458 --> 01:52:47,750
When we leave a footprint in the sand,
in the snow, in the ether,

1162
01:52:47,833 --> 01:52:49,333
you're going to sweep it.

1163
01:52:50,208 --> 01:52:53,208
You're going to protect us
from those who want to put us in cages,

1164
01:52:53,291 --> 01:52:55,625
and you're gonna help us
find those jobs...

1165
01:52:57,500 --> 01:52:59,166
that are best suited to us.

1166
01:53:02,041 --> 01:53:03,333
She's not asking.

1167
01:53:08,958 --> 01:53:09,791
I'd be honored.

1168
01:53:12,041 --> 01:53:13,291
Then let's go to work.

1169
01:54:06,125 --> 01:54:07,083
Booker.

1170
01:54:12,500 --> 01:54:14,250
It's nice to finally meet you.
