1
00:04:08,988 --> 00:04:10,197
I got eyes on the animal.

2
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:15,619
Let's all go to the lobby

3
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:19,999
let's all go to the lobby

4
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,420
- to get ourselves a treatfi
- run! Go!

5
00:04:24,503 --> 00:04:26,922
Delicious things to eat

6
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:29,925
the popcorn can't be beat

7
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:33,012
the sparkling drinks are just dandy

8
00:04:33,095 --> 00:04:35,598
the chocolate bars and the candy

9
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:40,811
so let's all go to the lobby
to get ourselves a treat

10
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:45,024
What?

11
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:48,944
Let me out!

12
00:04:58,078 --> 00:04:59,079
Keep it steady!

13
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:14,386
Damn, I don't see it. Do you see it?

14
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,097
Settle down, kid. She can't run forever.

15
00:05:34,907 --> 00:05:37,243
Dinosaurs are in our world

16
00:05:37,326 --> 00:05:41,080
and with every confrontation, we learn
more about this frightening new reality

17
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,376
How did we get here?

18
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:47,086
Oh, my god.

19
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:50,673
It's been three decades
since the deadly events at Jurassic park,

20
00:05:50,756 --> 00:05:53,926
and we've yet to find a way
for these animals to live safely among us.

21
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,472
After the devastating eruption
of ls/a nublar's long-dormant volcano,

22
00:05:58,556 --> 00:06:01,767
those who survived were transported
to the mainland

23
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,728
many of the larger predators
were captured,

24
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:06,897
but the remaining creatures
scattered here,

25
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:09,567
in big rock national park.

26
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,195
While most remained in the wild,
those who made their way to civih'zation

27
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,823
struggled to adapt
to unfam/liar conditions.

28
00:06:17,116 --> 00:06:19,827
Local authorities have warned
the animals are unpredictable,

29
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,746
and when hung/y, extremely violent.

30
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,750
As the dinosaurs spread across borders,
a global black market has risen.

31
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:30,879
- They're not ours.
- Go on, you sad, pathetic loser!

32
00:06:30,963 --> 00:06:34,008
To combat the growing threat
of illegal poachers,

33
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:36,051
the us congress awarded
sole collection rights

34
00:06:36,135 --> 00:06:39,305
to the global giant BIOS yn genetics.

35
00:06:39,388 --> 00:06:42,016
At biosyn, we're dedicated to the idea

36
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:46,145
that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves.

37
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:51,817
Ceo Lewis dodgson has created a
sanctuary in ltaly's dolomite ll/lountains,

38
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,737
where he hopes to study
the dinosaurs ' ancient 1mmune systems

39
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,947
for unique pharmaceutical properties.

40
00:06:57,031 --> 00:07:00,576
While BIOS yn belie ves
we can handle genetic power responsibly,

41
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:02,369
the public remains skeptical.

42
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,542
Some note these government contracts have
led to massive spikes in biosyn's profits.

43
00:07:08,626 --> 00:07:13,255
And rumors persist of a human clone
who mysteriously disappeared,

44
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:14,840
leading to a worldwide search.

45
00:07:15,424 --> 00:07:18,427
Some believe she's genetically identical
to Charlotte lockwood

46
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:22,181
deceased daughter of Jurassic park
co-founder, Benjamin lockwood.

47
00:07:22,264 --> 00:07:25,559
Now that we brought these animals
back from extinction,

48
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:27,436
can we face the consequences?

49
00:07:28,145 --> 00:07:29,605
Are we respons/ble for them,

50
00:07:29,688 --> 00:07:32,191
or should they be left
to fend for themselves?

51
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,569
As we adapt to an ever-changing world,

52
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:38,030
we must find answers to these questions,

53
00:07:38,113 --> 00:07:40,532
for their safety as well as for our own.

54
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,748
Let it go!

55
00:07:49,124 --> 00:07:50,292
Hold on!

56
00:08:25,953 --> 00:08:30,082
We are inside
the illegal breeding facility.

57
00:08:30,874 --> 00:08:34,169
The juveniles are kept in cages
to keep costs down.

58
00:08:34,878 --> 00:08:36,505
It's medieval.

59
00:08:40,676 --> 00:08:41,676
Claire.

60
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:48,267
Why do you think he's separated
from the rest?

61
00:08:50,352 --> 00:08:52,438
I don't think he's gonna make it.

62
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:00,654
No. What are you doing?
We could report this.

63
00:09:00,738 --> 00:09:03,240
The dfw takes days to investigate.

64
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:05,743
We can save this one now.

65
00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:08,287
It's okay. It's okay, buddy.

66
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:12,916
Okay. Here we go.

67
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,798
Nope. No!

68
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:21,967
- Lift.
- Okay.

69
00:09:22,551 --> 00:09:23,969
- Support the head.
- Yeah.

70
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:25,721
Okay. Yeah.

71
00:09:25,804 --> 00:09:27,699
- Hurry up!
- Check the right side.

72
00:09:27,723 --> 00:09:29,558
- With me.
- Go, go, go.

73
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:31,143
Okay, come on.
Come on, let's go.

74
00:09:36,273 --> 00:09:38,192
- Hold on!
- To what?

75
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:56,710
Shit.

76
00:10:02,257 --> 00:10:04,176
Claire, we're gonna get shot!

77
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:12,601
- No! Claire! No, no, Claire!
- Oh, god.

78
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:22,985
Oh, shit.

79
00:10:26,657 --> 00:10:27,991
Everybody good?

80
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:43,715
Okay. Okay, so I think
we get this one to the dfw,

81
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,551
and then we hit them again.

82
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:48,136
Yeah. Yeah, you saw
that breeding ground, right?

83
00:10:48,804 --> 00:10:49,805
We're done.

84
00:10:51,932 --> 00:10:53,308
I got a call last week.

85
00:10:53,392 --> 00:10:57,020
It's a real job, something I can do
to effectively change things.

86
00:10:57,104 --> 00:10:59,231
- I gotta take it.
- They need us.

87
00:10:59,314 --> 00:11:02,276
Are you saving these dinosaurs
because they need us,

88
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:04,611
or are you saving them
to absolve yourself?

89
00:11:04,695 --> 00:11:06,697
- Claire.
- I mean, this is crazy.

90
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:08,532
Claire,

91
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:10,617
you're doing the right thing.

92
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:14,121
But this... this isn't the way
to go about it anymore.

93
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:18,142
Honestly, you need someone
who's good at being shot at.

94
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:22,004
Aren't you and Owen still,
like, a weird thing?

95
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:24,047
- It's not that weird.
- He didn't mean "weird."

96
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:25,674
Mm-mmm.

97
00:11:25,757 --> 00:11:28,051
Uh, he meant, like, surprising.

98
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,948
Hyah!

99
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:08,008
Let's bring 'em home!

100
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:31,949
Hyah!

101
00:13:12,823 --> 00:13:14,491
Okay, come here.

102
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:20,080
Okay.

103
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:22,958
Hey, hey.

104
00:13:32,843 --> 00:13:34,845
We're gonna get you
some place safe.

105
00:13:38,473 --> 00:13:41,226
Hey.

106
00:13:44,062 --> 00:13:45,313
There you go.

107
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:47,190
There you go.

108
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:49,276
Yeah.

109
00:14:27,773 --> 00:14:28,940
Shit.

110
00:14:37,783 --> 00:14:40,744
Poaching's three to five.
Y'all know that.

111
00:14:41,787 --> 00:14:44,623
Looks like we'll be
taking that animal off your hands.

112
00:14:44,706 --> 00:14:45,707
Like hell you will.

113
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,752
All right. Seems our friend
don't recognize the badge.

114
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:54,007
Department of fish and wildlife.

115
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:58,345
We're rounding up that dinosaur
for its own safety.

116
00:15:00,514 --> 00:15:01,515
That's funny.

117
00:15:02,641 --> 00:15:06,895
'Cause my friends here,
they typically know all the new recruits.

118
00:15:06,978 --> 00:15:09,458
Shep, do you remember meeting these guys
in orientation or not?

119
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:11,066
Nope.

120
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:16,822
Dinosaur bone powder goes for what?
3000 an ounce?

121
00:15:17,489 --> 00:15:19,157
Makes this animal here worth about...

122
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:22,118
Shoot, $500,000?

123
00:15:24,412 --> 00:15:26,248
How y'all want this to go, huh?

124
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,168
Your bones ain't worth nothing to me.

125
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:32,462
Hey, brother.

126
00:15:34,464 --> 00:15:35,465
He ain't lying.

127
00:15:53,984 --> 00:15:54,985
I'll see you around.

128
00:16:03,243 --> 00:16:05,328
Never seen you walk away
from a fight before.

129
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:11,626
Yeah.

130
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:13,962
I got obligations.

131
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:20,946
Shouldn't you be in school?

132
00:17:21,571 --> 00:17:22,697
I'm homeschooled.

133
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:26,034
That so?

134
00:17:27,202 --> 00:17:28,203
And where's home?

135
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:37,212
I don't know!

136
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,881
Vvhoa!

137
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:42,050
Better not stand there, man.

138
00:17:45,095 --> 00:17:46,972
Holy crap.

139
00:17:51,685 --> 00:17:53,478
What in the world, man?

140
00:18:16,209 --> 00:18:18,253
So, the dinosaurs...

141
00:19:28,865 --> 00:19:29,908
Hey.

142
00:19:32,077 --> 00:19:33,078
Where you been?

143
00:19:33,828 --> 00:19:35,914
Nowhere. What are you burning?

144
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:39,834
Oh, nothing. Just some old blankets.

145
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,755
You sure you didn't go past the bridge?

146
00:19:44,631 --> 00:19:46,567
That's the look you give me
when you think I'm lying.

147
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:47,759
- Well, are you?
- No.

148
00:19:47,842 --> 00:19:50,095
Maisie, you're literally looking
everywhere but here.

149
00:19:50,178 --> 00:19:52,305
I said I didn't go past the bridge.

150
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:57,644
Maisie,

151
00:19:58,186 --> 00:19:59,312
can we start over?

152
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:02,249
I know, Claire. There are people out there
who'll do anything to find me.

153
00:20:02,273 --> 00:20:04,150
I'm not angry.

154
00:20:04,234 --> 00:20:07,237
- That means you don't have to be angry.
- I'm not angry.

155
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:10,532
- I can take care of myself.
- Hey.

156
00:20:10,615 --> 00:20:14,619
It's okay for us to depend on each other.
That's what people do.

157
00:20:14,702 --> 00:20:16,663
How would I know what people do?

158
00:20:17,497 --> 00:20:20,834
The only people I've spoken to
in the past four years are you both.

159
00:20:22,544 --> 00:20:24,921
Besides,
I'm not even a real person anyway.

160
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,007
- What?
- I was made from someone else.

161
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,926
I'm not me.

162
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:40,562
You are the only you who ever was.

163
00:20:42,856 --> 00:20:43,940
What?

164
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:46,484
- N-No.
- Was that, like, really corny?

165
00:20:46,568 --> 00:20:47,735
It was so corny.

166
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:50,530
- Can we keep that between us?
- Can't promise that.

167
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,496
- Hey, kid.
- Hello.

168
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,664
Sorry I'm late.

169
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,918
Aw.

170
00:21:04,002 --> 00:21:05,628
You smell like horses.

171
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:07,922
- Mmm.
- Oh, you like that, do ya?

172
00:21:08,006 --> 00:21:09,174
- I do. Yeah.
- Oh.

173
00:21:09,257 --> 00:21:11,926
Okay. Um...

174
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,596
I'm gonna make dinner.

175
00:21:15,346 --> 00:21:16,598
Everything okay?

176
00:21:17,182 --> 00:21:18,975
She went into town again.

177
00:21:21,728 --> 00:21:24,147
Ah, this kid.
Did you talk to her?

178
00:21:24,856 --> 00:21:25,899
Itned.

179
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,861
I'll talk to her.

180
00:22:59,325 --> 00:23:01,703
Slow breaths. Take your time.

181
00:23:28,646 --> 00:23:31,899
Hey. Cut away from yourself.

182
00:23:36,154 --> 00:23:37,322
Vvhoa!

183
00:23:38,865 --> 00:23:40,450
Wanna know how to win
a knife fight?

184
00:23:41,326 --> 00:23:42,952
You gotta let yourself get cut.

185
00:23:43,036 --> 00:23:45,330
Make sure they're cutting
something dispensable

186
00:23:45,413 --> 00:23:46,914
while you're cutting something vital.

187
00:23:47,707 --> 00:23:49,167
And then say something cool like...

188
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,420
"Wrong girl, wrong time."

189
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,714
Wrong girl, wrong time.

190
00:23:54,797 --> 00:23:55,882
Whoo!

191
00:23:56,507 --> 00:23:57,967
- Stone-cold.
- Right?

192
00:23:58,051 --> 00:24:00,803
- I would not mess with her.
- No way.

193
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:09,645
Listen. We should probably
talk about you going into town.

194
00:24:09,729 --> 00:24:10,897
I don't...

195
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,420
I don't think you understand
how bad it is being trapped here.

196
00:24:13,483 --> 00:24:16,611
You're not trapped here.
We just don't trust people.

197
00:24:16,694 --> 00:24:18,112
No, you just don't trust me.

198
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:20,656
And then you expect me to trust you.

199
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,076
- Why can't I have any freedom?
- Because you can't.

200
00:24:28,956 --> 00:24:29,999
That went great.

201
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:31,918
What is happening?

202
00:24:33,044 --> 00:24:34,962
- She's 14.
- Yeah.

203
00:24:35,046 --> 00:24:36,464
You remember what that was like.

204
00:24:37,715 --> 00:24:38,716
I do.

205
00:24:40,885 --> 00:24:42,595
We can't keep her here forever.

206
00:24:42,678 --> 00:24:46,182
If we don't figure this out, she's gonna
go a lot farther than the bridge.

207
00:24:46,265 --> 00:24:48,226
If they find her,
we're never gonna see her again.

208
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:50,895
We gotta protect her. That's ourjob.
That's what we're gonna do.

209
00:24:50,978 --> 00:24:52,105
Protect her how?

210
00:24:52,688 --> 00:24:54,023
By locking her inside?

211
00:24:55,817 --> 00:24:57,443
She's got questions.

212
00:24:59,028 --> 00:25:00,947
You know? Questions we can't answer.

213
00:25:03,074 --> 00:25:04,659
She wants to know who she is.

214
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,373
Who Charlotte lockwood was.

215
00:25:15,711 --> 00:25:18,005
Tracked Grady to his house.

216
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:20,967
You were right. Raptor's got a juvenile.

217
00:25:22,927 --> 00:25:24,637
But listen, there's something else.

218
00:25:26,013 --> 00:25:27,807
I found that girl you've been after.

219
00:25:42,905 --> 00:25:43,906
Here you go.

220
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,272
Thanks for coming.

221
00:26:58,856 --> 00:27:00,274
Wasn't sure who to call.

222
00:27:00,983 --> 00:27:04,278
Fish and wildlife didn't even want
to see it if it wasn't a dinosaur.

223
00:27:04,362 --> 00:27:06,656
Yeah, well,
they get all the attention.

224
00:27:06,739 --> 00:27:08,491
You guys want to vary
the sampling plots

225
00:27:08,574 --> 00:27:09,575
a hundred yards each?

226
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:11,452
These your students?

227
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:15,748
Yeah. We've been looking into the impact
of industrial farming on the environment.

228
00:27:15,831 --> 00:27:18,292
So, this is right up our alley.

229
00:27:18,376 --> 00:27:20,336
They hit 60 fields
in the county.

230
00:27:21,128 --> 00:27:23,047
You seen anything like
this before?

231
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,299
No. Not like this.

232
00:27:25,383 --> 00:27:28,386
They've been leaving degraded fields
all across the midwest.

233
00:27:28,469 --> 00:27:33,140
First these big companies try to kill off
all the insects, now this.

234
00:27:43,776 --> 00:27:45,111
Is that your land?

235
00:27:45,194 --> 00:27:48,030
That's the bennetts' corn.
The locusts didn't eat that.

236
00:27:48,114 --> 00:27:50,449
You plant the same seed
as the bennetts?

237
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,661
We're independent.

238
00:27:55,288 --> 00:27:57,206
They use biosyn seed.

239
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:01,210
Yeah, I bet they do.

240
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,380
You say you caught a live one?

241
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,802
Kids, this is Dr. Ellie sattler.

242
00:28:09,885 --> 00:28:11,929
She's a scientist from the university.

243
00:28:12,013 --> 00:28:13,472
A bug scientist?

244
00:28:13,556 --> 00:28:15,558
Uh, sort of.

245
00:28:15,641 --> 00:28:18,019
I study plants from a long time ago,

246
00:28:18,102 --> 00:28:22,023
and that helps me figure out
how to protect plants and soil now.

247
00:28:22,106 --> 00:28:25,151
Wow. Look at that.

248
00:28:29,071 --> 00:28:30,698
Pretty cool, huh?

249
00:28:30,781 --> 00:28:33,576
This is called a field sequencer,

250
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:37,163
and it helps me read DNA
everywhere I am.

251
00:28:37,705 --> 00:28:41,459
I'm gonna put this swab in his mouth.

252
00:28:43,085 --> 00:28:44,462
Good job.

253
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:49,383
And now, I need to take your little buddy
on a road trip.

254
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:50,926
Where are you taking it?

255
00:28:52,553 --> 00:28:54,555
I need a second opinion.

256
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,395
- Hey, Madeline?
- Yeah?

257
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:04,023
We just gotta clean out
this little cylinder.

258
00:29:04,106 --> 00:29:05,941
Okay. Let her down slow.

259
00:29:07,735 --> 00:29:09,570
- Got it?
- Yeah.

260
00:29:09,653 --> 00:29:11,030
Easy.

261
00:29:11,113 --> 00:29:13,741
Let's start padding that other side.

262
00:29:13,824 --> 00:29:16,160
Just about there. I'm on it.

263
00:29:17,495 --> 00:29:18,996
Why do we dig?

264
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:24,835
Because paleontology is science,
and science is about the truth.

265
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:26,879
And there is truth in these rocks.

266
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,050
Stop.

267
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:35,054
It says here
that the t. Rex had a tiny brain.

268
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:38,891
Well, it turns out that t. Rex
was way smarter than we thought.

269
00:29:38,974 --> 00:29:41,310
Capable of memory, of loyalty.

270
00:29:41,394 --> 00:29:43,145
That's a t. Rex.

271
00:29:43,687 --> 00:29:45,689
They've been around
since, like, the '90s.

272
00:29:45,773 --> 00:29:47,775
I don't get why we're here
digging up bones.

273
00:29:47,858 --> 00:29:51,070
It just seems kinda random.

274
00:29:51,153 --> 00:29:52,279
Right.

275
00:29:52,363 --> 00:29:53,697
Grant!

276
00:29:54,782 --> 00:29:56,325
You're gonna want to see this.

277
00:29:56,992 --> 00:29:58,411
Guys, can you help me?

278
00:29:58,494 --> 00:30:01,414
I'll pack it out.
I'll make sure nobody else crosses it.

279
00:30:09,004 --> 00:30:10,172
Ellie sattler.

280
00:30:11,882 --> 00:30:13,134
Alan Grant.

281
00:30:13,843 --> 00:30:15,219
You look the same.

282
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:20,474
And this place, it's so...

283
00:30:21,475 --> 00:30:23,644
So, uh... you.

284
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:28,566
I'm sorry. If I'd known
you were coming, I would've...

285
00:30:35,448 --> 00:30:37,158
Can I get you something?
A beer or...

286
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:42,288
Um, well, maybe not at 10:00 am,
but iced tea or...

287
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:43,789
Tea. Yeah.

288
00:30:43,873 --> 00:30:45,040
Tea. I can do that.

289
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:49,253
Saw a lot of tourists
on the way in.

290
00:30:50,963 --> 00:30:55,134
Well, the funding's dried up,
so somebody's gotta pay for all this.

291
00:30:55,217 --> 00:30:56,635
Right. Thank you.

292
00:30:59,096 --> 00:31:03,017
I read your articles about soil science
and regenerative farming.

293
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,310
That's great.

294
00:31:04,393 --> 00:31:05,394
Thanks.

295
00:31:05,478 --> 00:31:07,521
Gave me grounds
for some hope for a change.

296
00:31:08,063 --> 00:31:09,982
And the one about growing algae.

297
00:31:10,065 --> 00:31:12,610
Mmm! Alan, it's amazing.

298
00:31:12,693 --> 00:31:15,404
It's a totally viable
carbon-neutral fuel.

299
00:31:15,488 --> 00:31:19,366
It's incredible. Our answers
are in our oceans and in our soil.

300
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:22,010
Sure, it's gonna take work,
but we're on the verge of extinction.

301
00:31:22,077 --> 00:31:23,913
My god. What are we gonna do?
Just sit around?

302
00:31:23,996 --> 00:31:25,623
Not on my watch.

303
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,791
What?

304
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:30,503
No, nothing. I just...

305
00:31:31,837 --> 00:31:34,006
Just like listening to you is all.

306
00:31:36,342 --> 00:31:37,801
So, you're here on your own?

307
00:31:37,885 --> 00:31:39,845
Yeah, yeah. On my own.

308
00:31:41,847 --> 00:31:42,932
How are your kids?

309
00:31:43,015 --> 00:31:44,058
Mmm.

310
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,811
Amazing. Grown. It's shocking.

311
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:50,272
They're both in college.
Can you believe that?

312
00:31:50,356 --> 00:31:51,649
And Mark?

313
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:54,735
It's over.

314
00:31:58,906 --> 00:32:00,574
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

315
00:32:00,658 --> 00:32:02,076
It's okay.

316
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,911
I'm back to me.

317
00:32:03,994 --> 00:32:06,038
And my work. You know, it's...

318
00:32:06,121 --> 00:32:07,122
That's great.

319
00:32:07,206 --> 00:32:10,292
It's good. It is. I'm alone at last.

320
00:32:10,376 --> 00:32:11,877
Exciting times.

321
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:14,463
Yeah, I'm living the Alan Grant life.

322
00:32:14,547 --> 00:32:16,173
- It's just...
- Can be lonely.

323
00:32:16,257 --> 00:32:17,508
So freeing.

324
00:32:20,594 --> 00:32:21,637
Ellie.

325
00:32:23,472 --> 00:32:27,643
You didn't come out all this way
just to catch up, now, did you?

326
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,065
Well, that's a locust.

327
00:32:33,148 --> 00:32:35,859
Mandibles, wings, thorax, but...

328
00:32:36,777 --> 00:32:38,654
God, the size of it is massive.

329
00:32:40,573 --> 00:32:43,701
It has genes that have been extinct
since the cretaceous.

330
00:32:43,784 --> 00:32:47,162
And swarms of them are decimating crops
from Iowa to Texas.

331
00:32:48,122 --> 00:32:49,164
Terrifying, right?

332
00:32:50,374 --> 00:32:51,750
Started as a few hundred.

333
00:32:51,834 --> 00:32:53,919
There could be millions
by the end of the summer.

334
00:32:54,003 --> 00:32:58,465
If they keep going, there'll be
no grain to feed chickens, cattle.

335
00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:00,718
The entire food chain
would collapse.

336
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:04,888
Well, it's clearly designed,
but why would anyone do that?

337
00:33:05,848 --> 00:33:09,893
None of the crops they're eating
are biosyn seed.

338
00:33:09,977 --> 00:33:11,228
Biosyn.

339
00:33:12,146 --> 00:33:13,731
You're saying biosyn made this?

340
00:33:13,814 --> 00:33:17,610
I mean, it would not shock me that they
wanna control the world's food supply.

341
00:33:18,527 --> 00:33:20,154
Not before a few million starve.

342
00:33:20,237 --> 00:33:24,533
Yeah, what is that saying?
How we're three meals away from anarchy?

343
00:33:24,617 --> 00:33:27,995
If we don't stop them,
you can pick your last three meals.

344
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:31,790
So, why are you bringing it to me?

345
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:35,711
I need concrete evidence
biosyn's responsible for all this.

346
00:33:35,794 --> 00:33:39,715
I need to go to their sanctuary
and get DNA from another locust there.

347
00:33:41,717 --> 00:33:42,885
But I need a witness.

348
00:33:44,094 --> 00:33:45,137
Alan.

349
00:33:46,472 --> 00:33:48,515
You command respect.
People believe you.

350
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,559
Ellie.

351
00:33:50,643 --> 00:33:53,896
You know why I'm here.
It's quiet. I'm done with all that.

352
00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:55,189
Are you? Okay.

353
00:33:56,148 --> 00:33:57,816
Well, I'm sorry, Alan.

354
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,528
Nobody gets that luxury anymore,
not even you.

355
00:34:01,612 --> 00:34:02,613
And you know what?

356
00:34:04,073 --> 00:34:05,157
You're the one I trust.

357
00:34:09,578 --> 00:34:13,415
This biosyn sanctuary is, what,
a hundred miles from anywhere?

358
00:34:13,499 --> 00:34:14,833
How do you even get in there?

359
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:18,671
I got an invite
from their in-house philosopher.

360
00:34:20,047 --> 00:34:22,925
Seems there's a lot of money
in being a chaotician these days.

361
00:34:23,008 --> 00:34:26,428
And he just happened
to invite you out of the blue?

362
00:34:27,388 --> 00:34:29,056
He said there were things I'd wanna see.

363
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,182
Uh-huh.

364
00:34:36,313 --> 00:34:37,606
You coming or what?

365
00:34:46,115 --> 00:34:47,241
It's clear!

366
00:34:49,201 --> 00:34:51,328
Keep it going. That's good.

367
00:34:52,496 --> 00:34:55,040
Every animal captured
on the mainland comes through here

368
00:34:55,124 --> 00:34:57,835
before shipping out
to biosyn's sanctuary in the dolomites.

369
00:34:57,918 --> 00:35:00,879
We give them medical attention
and make sure they leave healthy.

370
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,090
So much security.

371
00:35:03,173 --> 00:35:04,925
Those are just the ones you see.

372
00:35:05,008 --> 00:35:07,219
A lot of shady types out there
want these guys.

373
00:35:09,722 --> 00:35:11,473
- Hey.
- Your plane's just fueling up.

374
00:35:12,725 --> 00:35:15,227
Biosyn's a tough invite.
You guys must know somebody.

375
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,062
- Do you mind if I...
- Of course.

376
00:35:19,314 --> 00:35:20,607
Hello.

377
00:35:20,691 --> 00:35:23,485
You see me? You follow me.

378
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:26,113
We rescued these guys
from an illegal breeding farm

379
00:35:26,196 --> 00:35:27,740
in Nevada a few weeks ago.

380
00:35:27,823 --> 00:35:30,909
Shut the whole place down.
Anonymous tip.

381
00:35:30,993 --> 00:35:34,747
Good girl. Yes. Yes.

382
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:38,625
Alan. You never get used to it.

383
00:35:38,709 --> 00:35:40,419
Okay. We're good. Close it up!

384
00:35:40,502 --> 00:35:41,962
- Take care.
- Thank you. Bye.

385
00:35:42,045 --> 00:35:43,046
Okay.

386
00:36:19,374 --> 00:36:20,751
Hey.

387
00:36:23,045 --> 00:36:24,505
You look just like blue.

388
00:36:27,674 --> 00:36:29,593
This?

389
00:36:29,676 --> 00:36:31,553
You wanna try it?

390
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:33,680
Okay.

391
00:36:41,939 --> 00:36:43,273
Huh.

392
00:36:47,945 --> 00:36:49,321
Maisie, don't move.

393
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:54,368
Hey, girl.

394
00:36:55,452 --> 00:36:56,495
Staying out of trouble?

395
00:36:57,454 --> 00:36:59,081
She had a baby. That's impossible.

396
00:37:02,376 --> 00:37:04,795
- Back up.
- She won't hurt us, right?

397
00:37:04,878 --> 00:37:06,338
You're damn right she will.

398
00:37:06,421 --> 00:37:07,881
Just breathe.

399
00:37:07,965 --> 00:37:10,467
- If you don't, she'll think you're scared.
- I am scared.

400
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,179
Nah.
She doesn't need to know that.

401
00:37:21,603 --> 00:37:24,606
Her nest has got to be nearby.
Maisie, get inside.

402
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,650
- I'm coming with you.
- What did I just say?

403
00:37:37,035 --> 00:37:39,454
- We gotta move.
- Not yet. We need the girl.

404
00:37:41,707 --> 00:37:42,833
Hey, what's up?

405
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:43,917
Wow.

406
00:37:47,087 --> 00:37:48,213
Maisie?

407
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:50,132
Maisie?

408
00:37:54,136 --> 00:37:56,138
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

409
00:37:56,722 --> 00:37:57,806
Where you going?

410
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,725
You can't keep me here.
You're not my mother.

411
00:38:06,523 --> 00:38:07,941
She's leaving the house.

412
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,425
Get in the truck!
Come on! Let's go!

413
00:38:33,508 --> 00:38:34,676
Got it!

414
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,904
- Tie it down!
- Hold on.

415
00:38:35,928 --> 00:38:36,929
Come on. Let's go!

416
00:38:38,931 --> 00:38:40,390
- Get in!
- Come on!

417
00:38:42,351 --> 00:38:43,352
Let's get out of here.

418
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:03,580
Who are you?

419
00:39:25,394 --> 00:39:26,395
Claire!

420
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,271
They found her.

421
00:39:28,355 --> 00:39:29,815
What? Who are they?

422
00:39:29,898 --> 00:39:31,733
Poachers. I've seen them around.

423
00:39:32,442 --> 00:39:33,735
Leader's a real shit-heel.

424
00:39:33,819 --> 00:39:35,821
He must have recognized me,
followed me here.

425
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:37,990
- Where is she?
- Go get the truck.

426
00:39:38,073 --> 00:39:39,157
Oh, my god.

427
00:39:42,244 --> 00:39:43,912
Oh, god.

428
00:39:47,124 --> 00:39:49,334
- Owen!
- Hey. No.

429
00:39:54,256 --> 00:39:55,382
They took her kid too.

430
00:39:59,511 --> 00:40:01,513
I am gonna get her back.

431
00:40:01,596 --> 00:40:03,598
I promise you that.

432
00:40:14,109 --> 00:40:15,152
Come on.

433
00:40:15,235 --> 00:40:16,361
I know who to call.

434
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:32,544
Please, please! No, no!

435
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:37,758
This year, man. What's next?

436
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:39,009
Historically?

437
00:40:39,092 --> 00:40:42,387
Uh, darkness, blood, rain of fire.
I think frogs.

438
00:40:42,471 --> 00:40:44,323
We're not gonna be around
for much longer anyway.

439
00:40:44,347 --> 00:40:46,349
These locusts in Nebraska
are about to wrap it up.

440
00:40:46,433 --> 00:40:47,726
They're eating the corn, wheat.

441
00:40:47,809 --> 00:40:49,853
Basically all of our food
and our food's food.

442
00:40:49,936 --> 00:40:51,772
So, we can say goodbye to this.

443
00:40:54,858 --> 00:40:55,859
Hello?

444
00:40:55,942 --> 00:40:58,195
Franklin. It's me. You at work?

445
00:40:58,278 --> 00:41:00,447
Okay, you're kind of
a subject of interest around here,

446
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,240
so I can't really be talking to you.

447
00:41:02,324 --> 00:41:04,951
Come on. I'm in trouble.
I really need your help. Please.

448
00:41:05,035 --> 00:41:06,286
Yeah, and I could lose my job,

449
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:08,371
and you know I'm not qualified
to do anything else.

450
00:41:08,455 --> 00:41:09,581
We 're outs/de.

451
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:12,876
Let me talk to him.

452
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,965
- That him?
- That's him.

453
00:41:19,049 --> 00:41:23,136
Name's rainn delacourt.
Real piece of work.

454
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,221
What'd he take?

455
00:41:25,347 --> 00:41:27,516
Something we care about
very much.

456
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,186
Oh, shit. I told you somebody
would come looking for her.

457
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:33,105
You can't just take a person, Claire.

458
00:41:33,188 --> 00:41:35,148
- We had no choice.
- Not in the eyes of the law.

459
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,068
This guy is not the law.
Tell us how to find him.

460
00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:40,737
Where'd you call me from?

461
00:41:43,365 --> 00:41:45,700
We have a man on the inside
of delacourt's operation.

462
00:41:45,784 --> 00:41:48,411
There's an exchange in Malta
sometime tomorrow. Cash for cargo.

463
00:41:48,495 --> 00:41:49,913
Was she with him?

464
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:54,042
There's no mention,
but we have people on the ground already.

465
00:41:54,126 --> 00:41:55,502
One of them you know.

466
00:41:55,585 --> 00:41:58,130
A lot of us got recruited by the CIA
after the park went down.

467
00:41:59,965 --> 00:42:01,424
Barry's French intelligence now.

468
00:42:03,552 --> 00:42:04,719
I need to talk to him.

469
00:42:04,803 --> 00:42:06,888
You can't just call him.
He's deep cover.

470
00:42:06,972 --> 00:42:08,723
Look, once we make
the bust in Malta,

471
00:42:08,807 --> 00:42:11,017
our guys will see
if delacourt knows where she is.

472
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:14,187
Our guys. Not you.

473
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:18,775
Promise me you won't go in there
with your vest and mess everything up.

474
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,069
Why would I do that?

475
00:42:22,404 --> 00:42:24,573
Look, you guys are both crazy,

476
00:42:24,656 --> 00:42:29,119
but you seem like you're good parents,
or whatever you're trying to be.

477
00:42:29,703 --> 00:42:31,163
She's lucky to have you.

478
00:42:32,664 --> 00:42:34,499
Don't get killed, okay?

479
00:42:52,434 --> 00:42:54,186
I think we're almost there.

480
00:42:55,187 --> 00:42:56,188
Yeah.

481
00:43:09,868 --> 00:43:11,828
Dr. Sattler. Dr. Grant.

482
00:43:11,912 --> 00:43:14,206
- Ramsay Cole, communications.
- Oh, hey.

483
00:43:14,289 --> 00:43:16,541
I have to warn you,
everyone's so excited to have you.

484
00:43:16,625 --> 00:43:19,169
You guys are absolute legends
around here.

485
00:43:19,252 --> 00:43:22,005
Mmm. You must be confusing us
with somebody else.

486
00:43:22,088 --> 00:43:25,050
You know, it's great that you guys
are still so close with Dr. Malcolm.

487
00:43:25,133 --> 00:43:27,969
I mean, sometimes you meet your heroes
and they disappoint you,

488
00:43:28,053 --> 00:43:30,222
but he's exactly the way
you'd want him to be.

489
00:43:30,305 --> 00:43:32,724
I mean, such motility of thought.
It's incredible.

490
00:43:32,807 --> 00:43:34,601
How much time
have you spent with him?

491
00:43:35,852 --> 00:43:38,855
Uh, well, I know that was sarcastic,
but honestly, not enough.

492
00:43:38,939 --> 00:43:41,149
Oh, please. After you.
And watch your head.

493
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:51,344
Biosyn bought this land
for the Amber deposits back in the '905.

494
00:43:51,368 --> 00:43:53,411
But we've managed
to turn it into a safe haven

495
00:43:53,495 --> 00:43:54,913
for about 20 displaced species.

496
00:43:54,996 --> 00:43:58,917
First generation came from sorna.
Most of the nublar dinosaurs are here too.

497
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,836
Took fish and wildlife three years
to catch the t. Rex.

498
00:44:02,462 --> 00:44:04,422
- The...
- The t. Rex is here?

499
00:44:04,506 --> 00:44:06,299
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

500
00:44:26,528 --> 00:44:29,030
Aerial deterrent system, active.

501
00:44:29,531 --> 00:44:32,409
Restricted air space.
Protects the airborne life.

502
00:44:32,492 --> 00:44:34,828
Keeps the pterosaurs below 500 feet.

503
00:44:34,911 --> 00:44:35,912
Airborne?

504
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,083
Is that dreadnoughtus?

505
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:41,584
What?

506
00:44:49,259 --> 00:44:50,593
Beautiful, right?

507
00:44:51,177 --> 00:44:55,056
The name means "fear nothing."
Well, I guess you know that.

508
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,559
- What do they graze on?
- Hawthorn and fern.

509
00:44:57,642 --> 00:45:00,979
All indigenous. Nothing stocked
except for the deer population.

510
00:45:01,062 --> 00:45:03,898
It's a great mezzanine species
for the apex predator.

511
00:45:04,524 --> 00:45:06,276
The apex predator?

512
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:07,902
Giganotosaurus.

513
00:45:08,737 --> 00:45:10,071
At least for now.

514
00:45:20,248 --> 00:45:22,917
You don't let people in there, right?

515
00:45:23,001 --> 00:45:25,712
Uh, no. Our... our research...

516
00:45:25,795 --> 00:45:28,673
Our research outposts are connected
completely underground.

517
00:45:28,757 --> 00:45:31,801
If we have to,
we can just herd the animals remotely

518
00:45:31,885 --> 00:45:36,139
using a neuro-implant that sends
electrical signals directly to the brain.

519
00:45:36,222 --> 00:45:37,640
Like shocks?

520
00:45:37,724 --> 00:45:40,226
Uh... n-no, like signals.

521
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:43,188
Doesn't it strike you as a little bit...

522
00:45:43,271 --> 00:45:44,647
- Cruel?
- Cruel.

523
00:45:45,231 --> 00:45:48,860
Do you know how much voltage was
in the electric fences at Jurassic park?

524
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:50,820
Yeah.

525
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:59,746
Please join Dr. LAN Malcolm
at noon in the lecture hall

526
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:01,623
for the ethics of genetic power.

527
00:46:01,706 --> 00:46:03,792
God, everyone's so young.

528
00:46:03,875 --> 00:46:07,212
Well, it is part of our ethos
to attract the best and brightest.

529
00:46:07,796 --> 00:46:08,797
Doctors.

530
00:46:09,297 --> 00:46:13,968
Respected, renowned Dr. Sattler.
Dr. Grant. Hi.

531
00:46:14,052 --> 00:46:16,179
Wow, this is big. I'm Lewis.

532
00:46:16,262 --> 00:46:18,223
- Dodgson. Yeah.
- Hi.

533
00:46:18,306 --> 00:46:20,076
- You're Lewis dodgson?
- I am. How do you do?

534
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,018
We didn't expect
to actually see you here.

535
00:46:22,102 --> 00:46:24,312
Well, I wouldn't be anywhere else.

536
00:46:24,396 --> 00:46:26,147
- Would you?
- No.

537
00:46:26,231 --> 00:46:29,359
I mean, the people you see here
are changing the world.

538
00:46:29,442 --> 00:46:30,860
Would you mind if we, um...

539
00:46:31,653 --> 00:46:33,780
- Just to... it would mean a lot.
- Oh.

540
00:46:33,863 --> 00:46:35,949
Do you wanna, um...

541
00:46:36,032 --> 00:46:37,867
- Oh, great. Thank you so much.
- Oh.

542
00:46:37,951 --> 00:46:40,370
- That's good. That's good. Thanks.
- Okay.

543
00:46:40,453 --> 00:46:44,749
So, you are going to see
some remarkable things today.

544
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:48,545
We are unlocking the true power
of the genome.

545
00:46:48,628 --> 00:46:49,963
We're this close. Believe me.

546
00:46:50,046 --> 00:46:51,798
You'll make a fortune with that.

547
00:46:51,881 --> 00:46:54,008
No, it's not about money.

548
00:46:54,092 --> 00:46:57,387
No, we've already identified dozens
of applications for paleo-DNA.

549
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:01,015
We're talking about cancer,
Alzheimer's, autoimmune.

550
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:02,642
We will be saving lives.

551
00:47:02,725 --> 00:47:04,602
- But... shh.
- I bet.

552
00:47:04,686 --> 00:47:08,773
Um, anyway, I wish I could
take you around myself, but, uh, it's...

553
00:47:08,857 --> 00:47:12,026
So, you're in more-than-capable hands
with ramsay.

554
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:15,238
He's basically a young me.

555
00:47:15,321 --> 00:47:19,951
Only smarter and, uh, taller.

556
00:47:20,034 --> 00:47:21,244
Do you have food?

557
00:47:21,995 --> 00:47:24,330
- Like, one of my bars?
- Pardon? Um...

558
00:47:24,414 --> 00:47:26,416
No, never mind.
I-I'll find something.

559
00:47:26,499 --> 00:47:30,795
So, I want to do more of this
later on, if we, um...

560
00:47:30,879 --> 00:47:33,089
Oh! We booked you
a private pod...

561
00:47:33,173 --> 00:47:34,674
- Right.
- For the trip out, so...

562
00:47:34,757 --> 00:47:37,510
It's beautiful. You'll love it.
Through the caverns and everything.

563
00:47:37,594 --> 00:47:39,262
You better hurry. Malcolm's on.

564
00:47:39,345 --> 00:47:41,181
He's a bit of a contrarian,
but I like him.

565
00:47:41,264 --> 00:47:43,224
He keeps us on our toes. Anyway.

566
00:47:43,808 --> 00:47:45,518
Thank you for being here. It's...

567
00:47:48,271 --> 00:47:50,482
Okay. Um, follow me, please.

568
00:47:52,692 --> 00:47:53,693
What?

569
00:47:53,943 --> 00:47:59,491
Human beings have no more right
to safety or Liberty

570
00:47:59,574 --> 00:48:02,494
than any other creature
on this planet.

571
00:48:04,454 --> 00:48:08,458
We not only lack dominion over nature,

572
00:48:09,417 --> 00:48:11,002
we're subordinate to it.

573
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,671
And now, here we are

574
00:48:13,755 --> 00:48:16,925
with the opportunity to rewrite life
at our fingertips.

575
00:48:17,008 --> 00:48:19,052
And just like nuclear power,

576
00:48:19,135 --> 00:48:21,930
nobody knew what to expect
with genetic engineering,

577
00:48:22,013 --> 00:48:25,850
but they pressed the button
and hoped for the best,

578
00:48:27,018 --> 00:48:29,812
just like you are doing now.

579
00:48:30,772 --> 00:48:32,941
Yep. You.

580
00:48:34,234 --> 00:48:39,822
You control the future
of our survival on planet earth.

581
00:48:39,906 --> 00:48:42,575
According to you,
the solution is genetic power.

582
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:46,037
But that same power
could devastate the food supply,

583
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:50,750
create new diseases,
alter the climate even further.

584
00:48:51,334 --> 00:48:54,629
Unforeseen consequences occur.

585
00:48:55,421 --> 00:49:00,176
And every time, every single time...

586
00:49:01,678 --> 00:49:03,638
We all act surprised?

587
00:49:03,721 --> 00:49:05,348
Because deep down,

588
00:49:05,431 --> 00:49:09,727
I don't think that any of us actually
believe that these dangers are real.

589
00:49:17,235 --> 00:49:19,904
In order to instigate
revolutionary change,

590
00:49:20,905 --> 00:49:26,869
we must transform human consciousness.

591
00:49:29,122 --> 00:49:31,124
Vvhoo!

592
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:33,459
Yeah!

593
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,004
- Mayam?
- Dr. Malcolm?

594
00:49:36,087 --> 00:49:38,923
Very good. There you go.

595
00:49:39,007 --> 00:49:40,776
I don't want to be rude
to my friends. Thank you.

596
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,969
Catch me on my way out.
Thanks, everybody.

597
00:49:43,928 --> 00:49:44,929
Look at you,

598
00:49:45,513 --> 00:49:48,808
and look at me, and look at you.

599
00:49:48,891 --> 00:49:50,560
Wha... this is so trippy.

600
00:49:51,227 --> 00:49:52,812
You look like you're doing well.

601
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:56,441
Well, I got five kids, you know,
whom I adore more than life itself, so...

602
00:49:56,524 --> 00:49:57,775
Expenses add up.

603
00:49:57,859 --> 00:50:01,904
You? Alan, are you...
You have any family or...

604
00:50:03,156 --> 00:50:05,366
- No.
- So, I need to talk to you.

605
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:08,411
Yeah, I need to talk to you too.
Privately.

606
00:50:08,494 --> 00:50:10,079
Do you two talk a lot?

607
00:50:10,163 --> 00:50:12,332
- He slid into my dms.
- He did what?

608
00:50:12,415 --> 00:50:14,250
- It's urgent, Ian.
- What did you do?

609
00:50:14,334 --> 00:50:16,085
Seven minutes to midnight stuff.

610
00:50:16,169 --> 00:50:18,588
The doomsday clock might be
about out of time,

611
00:50:18,671 --> 00:50:23,468
but, as they say, it's always darkest
just before eternal nothingness.

612
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:25,511
What?

613
00:50:27,472 --> 00:50:30,975
Locusts altered with cretaceous-era DNA.

614
00:50:31,059 --> 00:50:34,020
- That's not my field.
- But if these things continue to multiply,

615
00:50:34,103 --> 00:50:37,273
we're talking about
cascading system-wide effects, LAN.

616
00:50:37,357 --> 00:50:38,816
Gosh, that's a drag.

617
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,069
- What is the matter with you?
- "Drag"?

618
00:50:41,152 --> 00:50:43,192
Why, is there something special
you wanted me to do?

619
00:50:43,237 --> 00:50:45,615
- How about give a damn?
- You know too much not to care.

620
00:50:45,698 --> 00:50:48,868
Hey, I gave my opinion
robustly for years.

621
00:50:48,951 --> 00:50:52,664
As expected, the sum of our human
endeavors has led to our annihilation,

622
00:50:52,747 --> 00:50:56,918
and the only play now
is to take the time we have left and, uh...

623
00:50:57,502 --> 00:50:59,545
You know,
just like we always do, squander it.

624
00:50:59,629 --> 00:51:02,715
Honestly, Ian, that's bullshit.

625
00:51:02,799 --> 00:51:05,510
Can I offer you guys some Joe?

626
00:51:05,593 --> 00:51:08,971
Tyler, please, two cappuccinos.

627
00:51:09,055 --> 00:51:10,390
I don't want a cappuccino.

628
00:51:10,473 --> 00:51:12,308
I could do, like, a cortado
or macchiato...

629
00:51:12,392 --> 00:51:15,353
Trust me, it's real tough, thatjet lag.
This is gonna perk you right up.

630
00:51:20,316 --> 00:51:23,277
The locusts are part of a larger project
called hexapod allies.

631
00:51:23,361 --> 00:51:25,029
You're right about their intent.

632
00:51:25,113 --> 00:51:27,031
I started hearing rumors
six weeks ago.

633
00:51:27,115 --> 00:51:29,617
I read your piece on decadence
and put two and two together.

634
00:51:29,701 --> 00:51:32,870
- I was not raising my voice.
- You're beginning to. It's crescendoing.

635
00:51:32,954 --> 00:51:34,247
They're proliferating wildly.

636
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:36,833
They're lasting three,
four times longer than they should.

637
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:40,503
And all my models are pointing
toward a global ecological collapse, Ian.

638
00:51:40,586 --> 00:51:42,255
Downstairs, sublevel six.

639
00:51:42,338 --> 00:51:44,298
That's where they keep
the locusts.

640
00:51:44,382 --> 00:51:46,718
Look for a lab marked l4.

641
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:48,636
But wait, how are we
gonna get down there?

642
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,389
This looks so silky.
May I touch this blouse, by any chance?

643
00:51:51,472 --> 00:51:52,473
Sure.

644
00:51:52,557 --> 00:51:54,475
You know what it is?
Don't tell me. This is...

645
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,061
- You won't know it.
- Sustainable bamboo.

646
00:51:57,145 --> 00:51:59,397
- It is sustainable bamboo.
- That's why I said...

647
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,773
- How'd you know?
- I just know.

648
00:52:00,857 --> 00:52:02,191
- It's amazing.
- Very amazing.

649
00:52:02,275 --> 00:52:03,276
I've got cumin, cinnamon.

650
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,153
I've got allspice,
which is not very popular.

651
00:52:05,236 --> 00:52:06,556
- I've got five-spice...
- Doctor.

652
00:52:06,612 --> 00:52:08,281
If you're into that kind of feel.

653
00:52:08,364 --> 00:52:10,783
- Um, and let's talk milks.
- Yeah.

654
00:52:10,867 --> 00:52:12,869
Okay, soy milk, yes?

655
00:52:14,454 --> 00:52:16,038
- No.
- What just happened?

656
00:52:17,165 --> 00:52:18,458
We're in.

657
00:52:32,555 --> 00:52:34,682
Sub/e ve/ six. Restricted.

658
00:52:41,564 --> 00:52:43,566
Lewis, you're not listening to me.

659
00:52:43,649 --> 00:52:47,570
The locusts' prehistoric DNA has made them
stronger than they should be.

660
00:52:47,653 --> 00:52:50,448
They're multiplying like crazy
and they're not dying.

661
00:52:50,531 --> 00:52:53,034
- What part of this don't you understand?
- I do understand.

662
00:52:53,117 --> 00:52:54,869
This is gonna be a global famine.

663
00:52:54,952 --> 00:52:57,330
Hey, hey,
we can't anticipate everything.

664
00:52:57,413 --> 00:52:59,290
We need to eradicate the ones we released.

665
00:52:59,373 --> 00:53:01,250
- What?
- All of them.

666
00:53:01,334 --> 00:53:02,585
- No.no.
- Like...

667
00:53:02,668 --> 00:53:04,962
- Henry, we don't want to cause a panic.
- Like yesterday.

668
00:53:05,046 --> 00:53:06,714
We want control.

669
00:53:07,381 --> 00:53:08,841
There's no such thing.

670
00:53:21,312 --> 00:53:22,647
When we're afraid,

671
00:53:23,397 --> 00:53:24,816
what do we do?

672
00:53:24,899 --> 00:53:26,484
What have we done before?

673
00:53:27,318 --> 00:53:28,528
We follow through.

674
00:53:29,821 --> 00:53:31,239
That's what we do.

675
00:53:31,322 --> 00:53:32,323
Right?

676
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:36,160
Right.

677
00:53:39,288 --> 00:53:40,998
We found the girl.

678
00:53:41,082 --> 00:53:42,458
She's en route.

679
00:53:42,542 --> 00:53:44,710
- Cost me a fortune.
- What?

680
00:53:45,294 --> 00:53:47,296
- Wait, you found her?
- Yeah, found them both.

681
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,673
Her and the little raptor.

682
00:53:49,882 --> 00:53:53,845
Blue reproduced all on her own,
just like you said.

683
00:53:53,928 --> 00:53:55,054
You're so smart, Henry.

684
00:53:57,974 --> 00:53:59,141
That's why this works.

685
00:53:59,809 --> 00:54:02,019
You understand the value
of these creatures.

686
00:54:02,103 --> 00:54:03,521
You always have. I do too.

687
00:54:03,604 --> 00:54:07,483
We don't stop because of a, what,
little side project went south?

688
00:54:08,943 --> 00:54:13,197
Hey, if they trace the locusts back to us,

689
00:54:13,281 --> 00:54:14,699
they come for the dinosaurs.

690
00:54:14,782 --> 00:54:16,117
All your work, gone.

691
00:54:17,201 --> 00:54:20,037
Billions of dollars in assets, gone.

692
00:54:21,706 --> 00:54:24,125
Diamonds with no one to mine them.

693
00:54:25,376 --> 00:54:27,587
You really think
she's the solution?

694
00:54:30,798 --> 00:54:31,799
Okay.

695
00:54:33,634 --> 00:54:36,012
Everything involving the girl
goes through me, right?

696
00:54:38,347 --> 00:54:39,682
Is she all right?

697
00:54:39,765 --> 00:54:41,058
She better be.

698
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,313
She's the most valuable
intellectual property on the planet.

699
00:54:55,531 --> 00:54:57,074
I said I'd call you.

700
00:54:57,158 --> 00:54:58,451
They land yet?

701
00:54:58,534 --> 00:55:00,077
Second plane is incoming.

702
00:55:00,161 --> 00:55:02,914
- Who said anything about a second plane?
- We flew them separately.

703
00:55:02,997 --> 00:55:04,790
I'm not taking any chances.

704
00:55:04,874 --> 00:55:06,709
And we'll need payment before delivery.

705
00:55:06,792 --> 00:55:08,836
I didn't like what happened last time.

706
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,131
Okay. Okay, just call me when it's done.

707
00:55:21,807 --> 00:55:23,684
You said I was going some place safe.

708
00:55:24,769 --> 00:55:25,937
You are.

709
00:55:33,569 --> 00:55:36,530
- Walk to the car.
- No.

710
00:55:37,156 --> 00:55:38,407
It's not a choice.

711
00:55:51,212 --> 00:55:54,340
Fifty grand to fly one little raptor.

712
00:55:54,423 --> 00:55:55,424
Not bad.

713
00:56:01,931 --> 00:56:03,182
What's with the girl?

714
00:56:05,476 --> 00:56:07,269
Not your problem.

715
00:56:15,444 --> 00:56:16,654
Pleasure doing business.

716
00:56:20,866 --> 00:56:22,201
We're ready. Let's go.

717
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:30,459
Owen.

718
00:56:35,214 --> 00:56:36,215
Hi, Claire.

719
00:56:37,091 --> 00:56:39,468
I thought you would've chosen
a quieter line of work.

720
00:56:39,552 --> 00:56:43,305
I tried. My cousin and I opened a café.
I lasted three weeks.

721
00:56:44,015 --> 00:56:46,392
The way the world is headed,
it's hard to look away.

722
00:56:47,268 --> 00:56:49,311
Delacourt was hired by soyona Santos,

723
00:56:49,395 --> 00:56:51,397
a broker
in the underground dinosaur trade.

724
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,691
We don't have intel on his cargo,

725
00:56:53,774 --> 00:56:57,319
but once they make the exchange,
we'll see what they know about your girl.

726
00:56:57,403 --> 00:57:00,781
You can listen in,
but promise me you will not make contact.

727
00:57:06,078 --> 00:57:08,438
There is a big underground market
for dinosaurs now.

728
00:57:08,497 --> 00:57:12,293
Europe, middle east, Northern Africa,
it all comes through here.

729
00:57:23,095 --> 00:57:25,222
Don't look at anyone,
don't talk to anyone.

730
00:57:25,806 --> 00:57:27,141
Just try to blend in.

731
00:58:03,052 --> 00:58:05,179
I'm okay.

732
00:58:17,274 --> 00:58:19,443
Still flying for Santos, huh?

733
00:58:19,527 --> 00:58:20,611
You must need money.

734
00:58:20,694 --> 00:58:21,695
What's it to you?

735
00:58:21,779 --> 00:58:23,823
I've got cargo.

736
00:58:23,906 --> 00:58:26,951
A thousand kilos of dinosaur
to palermo.

737
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,790
Lystrosaurus. Very rare.

738
00:58:32,873 --> 00:58:36,418
I give you two thousands.

739
00:58:37,086 --> 00:58:38,087
Eight.

740
00:58:40,005 --> 00:58:42,341
He may be ugly, but he's got spirit.

741
00:58:47,012 --> 00:58:50,558
- What are you gonna do with him?
- He's mine now. What do you care?

742
00:59:00,401 --> 00:59:01,819
Yeah! Come on, man!

743
00:59:07,032 --> 00:59:09,869
Yes!

744
00:59:19,128 --> 00:59:20,546
You lost?

745
00:59:21,297 --> 00:59:22,298
You're American.

746
00:59:23,966 --> 00:59:25,259
And that make us friends?

747
00:59:25,342 --> 00:59:28,429
- Listen, I just got here and...
- Oh, no.

748
00:59:28,512 --> 00:59:30,431
That was not an invitation. Here.

749
00:59:32,725 --> 00:59:33,851
Souvenir.

750
00:59:33,934 --> 00:59:37,229
Go back to the hotel, you know,
throw some bath salts in a bath.

751
00:59:37,313 --> 00:59:40,149
This place, not your vibe.

752
00:59:40,232 --> 00:59:41,233
Wait.

753
00:59:41,942 --> 00:59:43,611
- Look.
- Claire.

754
00:59:44,486 --> 00:59:45,487
Claire.

755
00:59:45,571 --> 00:59:47,364
I know this must feel exotic,

756
00:59:47,448 --> 00:59:50,868
but if you mess with the wrong person
down here, you disappear.

757
00:59:50,951 --> 00:59:51,952
You feel me?

758
00:59:52,661 --> 00:59:54,038
Good luck, okay?

759
00:59:54,121 --> 00:59:55,414
Wait.

760
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,293
- Wait.
- What is this?

761
00:59:59,376 --> 01:00:01,378
- I need your help.
- I don't know you.

762
01:00:01,462 --> 01:00:03,672
- I'm looking for someone.
- Don't do that.

763
01:00:03,756 --> 01:00:05,674
She is all alone. Please.

764
01:00:11,472 --> 01:00:13,807
- That your daughter?
- Yes.

765
01:00:16,602 --> 01:00:18,020
Sorry, I can't get involved.

766
01:00:37,915 --> 01:00:39,833
- Think I got him.
- Target on the move.

767
01:00:40,876 --> 01:00:43,045
That's our undercover agent
with him.

768
01:00:43,128 --> 01:00:45,005
Claire, he's headed underground.

769
01:00:45,089 --> 01:00:46,489
- You see him?
- Yeah, I've got him.

770
01:00:48,676 --> 01:00:49,969
All right, let's go.

771
01:00:50,052 --> 01:00:52,346
Team four,
need you to sweep spreading south.

772
01:00:52,429 --> 01:00:53,764
Come on!

773
01:00:56,809 --> 01:00:58,852
All units, take up bull 's-e ye position.

774
01:01:00,938 --> 01:01:02,231
This is bravo one.

775
01:01:02,314 --> 01:01:04,692
Primary target in s/ght.
No sign of the girl.

776
01:01:04,775 --> 01:01:06,568
Alpha team, stand clear.

777
01:01:17,288 --> 01:01:20,165
My people say the raptor arrived
in good condition.

778
01:01:20,874 --> 01:01:22,918
You boys didn't cock this up.

779
01:01:23,002 --> 01:01:24,712
Color me amazed.

780
01:01:25,296 --> 01:01:28,090
I do have another job for you.
Short hop, money's double.

781
01:01:28,173 --> 01:01:29,550
What's the cargo?

782
01:01:32,052 --> 01:01:33,304
Atrociraptors.

783
01:01:34,096 --> 01:01:35,264
Thoroughbreds.

784
01:01:35,347 --> 01:01:36,598
Trained to kill.

785
01:01:37,141 --> 01:01:39,351
- Kill who?
- Whoever they're told.

786
01:01:39,435 --> 01:01:42,688
Laser marks the target, they attach
to the scent, don't stop till it's dead.

787
01:01:42,771 --> 01:01:44,148
Inescapable.

788
01:01:44,231 --> 01:01:46,442
Those idiots making hybrids
had it all wrong.

789
01:01:47,026 --> 01:01:50,362
You can't engineer loyalty.
You have to nurture it.

790
01:01:50,446 --> 01:01:52,698
50,000 to fly them to Riyadh.

791
01:01:52,781 --> 01:01:54,867
In or out?

792
01:01:55,743 --> 01:01:56,785
She's not here.

793
01:02:01,248 --> 01:02:02,333
Where are we going?

794
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,668
Almost there.

795
01:02:10,132 --> 01:02:12,235
- That's the drop, let's go!
- Need eyes on...

796
01:02:12,259 --> 01:02:14,428
Weapons down! Eyes on them!

797
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:15,888
Hands in the air! Contact made!

798
01:02:15,971 --> 01:02:18,349
Delacourt, on the floor now!

799
01:02:18,432 --> 01:02:19,433
Get on the ground!

800
01:02:19,516 --> 01:02:21,226
Delacourt! Stay with him!

801
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:22,478
Shit.

802
01:02:24,188 --> 01:02:25,564
Get that truck out of here!

803
01:02:25,647 --> 01:02:27,191
There goes Santos!

804
01:02:33,489 --> 01:02:34,948
Damn, we lost delacourt.

805
01:02:47,669 --> 01:02:50,464
This is bravo one.
Truck is approaching the underpass.

806
01:02:52,257 --> 01:02:53,300
Go.

807
01:04:09,168 --> 01:04:10,961
Man, come on! Roll it!

808
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:27,728
The girl, where is she?
Where did they take her?

809
01:04:27,811 --> 01:04:29,229
- Get it off!
- Where is she?

810
01:04:29,313 --> 01:04:32,191
I don't know! We handed her off to Santos.

811
01:04:32,274 --> 01:04:34,401
I don't know
where they took her after that.

812
01:04:47,664 --> 01:04:50,000
Claire, it's Santos, the woman in white.

813
01:04:50,083 --> 01:04:51,083
I'll find her.

814
01:04:51,210 --> 01:04:54,046
- Spread out.
- Bravo team, watch your six.

815
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:58,717
- Hey, hey! Hey!
- Hold it!

816
01:04:59,718 --> 01:05:01,595
- Let them out.
- What?

817
01:05:02,262 --> 01:05:03,472
You heard me.

818
01:05:28,997 --> 01:05:29,998
Il/lerde.

819
01:05:47,933 --> 01:05:49,351
Claire, do you have her?

820
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,367
- We had some trouble.
- What kind?

821
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:08,745
The parents, Grady and dearing.
They're here.

822
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:15,711
- Can you take care of it?
- Not for free.

823
01:06:15,794 --> 01:06:18,088
Well, do it.

824
01:06:31,393 --> 01:06:33,437
Okay, okay. Listen.

825
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,896
Oh!

826
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:35,981
No, no, no!

827
01:06:49,077 --> 01:06:50,787
You don't use it on people.

828
01:06:50,871 --> 01:06:51,997
Where's my daughter?

829
01:06:52,706 --> 01:06:54,416
She wasn't yours to begin with.

830
01:06:55,167 --> 01:06:58,086
Tell me.

831
01:06:59,838 --> 01:07:01,006
Biosyn.

832
01:07:01,089 --> 01:07:03,091
They're taking her to biosyn.

833
01:07:10,057 --> 01:07:11,641
You missed her.

834
01:07:11,725 --> 01:07:13,143
She's gone.

835
01:08:11,993 --> 01:08:13,120
Take my hand. Come on.

836
01:08:43,817 --> 01:08:45,277
Hold on tight.

837
01:08:45,861 --> 01:08:46,987
What?

838
01:08:57,873 --> 01:09:00,101
Do you remember how we used
to get the raptors in the truck?

839
01:09:00,125 --> 01:09:01,126
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

840
01:09:03,211 --> 01:09:04,379
- You're up.
- No.

841
01:09:05,088 --> 01:09:07,465
At the last minute, dive roll.

842
01:09:08,175 --> 01:09:09,801
- I don't dive roll.
- You'll be fine.

843
01:09:10,635 --> 01:09:12,345
I never got the timing right.

844
01:09:14,181 --> 01:09:16,224
- Now?
- Any minute. Any minute now.

845
01:09:17,267 --> 01:09:18,894
Now?

846
01:09:21,188 --> 01:09:22,606
Now!

847
01:09:26,318 --> 01:09:27,944
Yeah. Yeah, yeah!

848
01:09:29,237 --> 01:09:30,405
Freeze!

849
01:09:37,746 --> 01:09:40,624
I'm flying us out of here.
Tell me where you wanna be dropped.

850
01:09:40,707 --> 01:09:42,042
You ever flown to biosyn?

851
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:45,503
Owen! They took her to BIOS yn.

852
01:09:45,587 --> 01:09:47,667
There is an airfield
on the north side of the island.

853
01:09:48,924 --> 01:09:51,343
You're under arrest. Stay where you are.

854
01:10:17,994 --> 01:10:19,371
Right!

855
01:10:24,167 --> 01:10:25,335
Heads up!

856
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:05,977
We made a lot of enemies today.
We gotta go.

857
01:12:06,061 --> 01:12:07,228
- He'll be here.
- Uh-huh.

858
01:12:11,608 --> 01:12:13,318
Out of time, out of time.

859
01:12:15,695 --> 01:12:16,696
There he is.

860
01:12:19,074 --> 01:12:21,159
- Pull over.
- That's not how planes work.

861
01:12:27,582 --> 01:12:28,792
Open the back.

862
01:12:47,685 --> 01:12:48,853
Come on!

863
01:12:54,275 --> 01:12:55,944
Hold on tight!

864
01:13:12,752 --> 01:13:14,254
Oh, sh...

865
01:13:26,224 --> 01:13:27,225
Still got it.

866
01:13:35,567 --> 01:13:37,026
Are you... are you hurt?

867
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:38,778
- Are you okay? You hurt?
- Yeah, yeah.

868
01:13:38,862 --> 01:13:40,822
- Where? Where are you hurt?
- Yeah.

869
01:13:40,905 --> 01:13:43,533
- Where are you hurt?
- No, no. I'm okay. I'm okay.

870
01:13:44,242 --> 01:13:45,368
Are you okay? What...

871
01:13:46,244 --> 01:13:49,080
- Arm hurts pretty bad. Is it bleeding?
- Are you all right?

872
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:51,207
I don't know.

873
01:13:51,291 --> 01:13:52,625
Am I? Am I?

874
01:13:54,043 --> 01:13:55,044
Let me see.

875
01:13:57,172 --> 01:13:59,132
- Is it... is it cut?
- No.No.

876
01:13:59,215 --> 01:14:00,216
No, you're okay.

877
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,301
- Okay.
- You're okay.

878
01:14:16,941 --> 01:14:18,359
Kayla watts.

879
01:14:19,569 --> 01:14:20,570
You're welcome.

880
01:14:21,112 --> 01:14:23,031
You don't look like you fly for biosyn.

881
01:14:23,114 --> 01:14:26,784
I'm gonna take that the way you meant it
and not the way it sounded.

882
01:14:26,868 --> 01:14:29,579
I fly for whoever got a bag,
but we'll call this one a favor.

883
01:14:29,662 --> 01:14:31,956
Those don't work. They broke.

884
01:14:33,708 --> 01:14:36,753
I'll take you all to biosyn,
but I can't promise it won't be dangerous.

885
01:14:37,337 --> 01:14:39,839
You're willing to risk your life
for people you never met?

886
01:14:41,466 --> 01:14:43,384
You wanna ask questions,
or you want a ride?

887
01:14:47,722 --> 01:14:48,932
We'll take the ride.

888
01:14:56,231 --> 01:14:58,274
So this is
our habitat development lab.

889
01:14:58,358 --> 01:15:00,985
A lot of exciting discoveries
as of late.

890
01:15:01,069 --> 01:15:03,530
We've brought back numerous species
in their purest form,

891
01:15:03,613 --> 01:15:07,659
and I mean complete, untouched genomes,
like ll/loros r'ntrepidus.

892
01:15:07,742 --> 01:15:08,993
- What?
- Yeah.

893
01:15:10,119 --> 01:15:12,247
Wow.

894
01:15:15,333 --> 01:15:17,335
What about splicing DNA?

895
01:15:17,418 --> 01:15:19,170
You know, creating new species.

896
01:15:19,254 --> 01:15:22,090
Oh, no, Dr. Sattler,
we don't do that here.

897
01:15:22,173 --> 01:15:23,613
We like to think we're more evolved.

898
01:15:28,555 --> 01:15:30,795
Looks like we still have
some time left before your ride.

899
01:15:31,432 --> 01:15:34,227
Uh, would you guys like to tour
the facilities yourselves?

900
01:15:34,894 --> 01:15:38,481
Oh, uh, I mean, we could.

901
01:15:38,565 --> 01:15:39,875
- Yeah, why not?
- Great.

902
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:44,404
I'll meet you guys at the hyperloop,
station three in about 30 minutes.

903
01:15:44,946 --> 01:15:47,073
Elevators are down this hall,
not those.

904
01:15:47,949 --> 01:15:49,617
Those lead you
down to the sublevels.

905
01:15:50,118 --> 01:15:51,845
You need special clearance
to get down there.

906
01:15:51,869 --> 01:15:53,329
- Oh, okay.
- Thirty minutes.

907
01:16:03,089 --> 01:16:04,966
Here. Take this.

908
01:16:06,968 --> 01:16:08,303
Okay?

909
01:16:08,386 --> 01:16:09,387
Yep.

910
01:16:18,855 --> 01:16:20,940
I'm really sorry
that it had to happen this way.

911
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:24,068
Yep, that's what kidnappers say.

912
01:16:25,236 --> 01:16:27,363
Claire should never have
hidden you away.

913
01:16:27,447 --> 01:16:29,574
You're way too important, maisie.

914
01:16:34,704 --> 01:16:35,744
You took her too?

915
01:16:36,748 --> 01:16:37,749
Yeah.

916
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:41,085
We needed her
to help us understand you.

917
01:16:46,174 --> 01:16:48,051
Hey, beta.

918
01:16:49,594 --> 01:16:50,887
You okay?

919
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:53,765
Did you say "beta"? Is that her name?

920
01:16:54,641 --> 01:16:55,642
I gave it to her.

921
01:16:56,601 --> 01:16:57,685
Beta is pretty special.

922
01:16:58,394 --> 01:16:59,562
You know, when we made blue,

923
01:16:59,646 --> 01:17:02,815
we used monitor lizard DNA
to fill in the gaps in her genome.

924
01:17:03,816 --> 01:17:06,778
Monitor lizards can reproduce
without a mate.

925
01:17:06,861 --> 01:17:10,782
So beta and blue
are genetically identical,

926
01:17:10,865 --> 01:17:12,760
and that's what they have
in common with you and...

927
01:17:12,784 --> 01:17:14,452
Charlotte.

928
01:17:17,205 --> 01:17:18,790
What do you know about Charlotte?

929
01:17:18,873 --> 01:17:20,416
She died.

930
01:17:21,542 --> 01:17:23,002
A long time ago.

931
01:17:23,961 --> 01:17:25,755
It broke my grandpa's heart.

932
01:17:27,632 --> 01:17:29,008
So he made me.

933
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,762
No, maisie. Actually, he didn't.

934
01:17:35,348 --> 01:17:37,350
Charlotte made you.

935
01:17:40,186 --> 01:17:43,022
I'm so excited for everyone to see
what we've been doing here.

936
01:17:43,731 --> 01:17:48,194
There is new technology being made,
new science, like, e very day almost.

937
01:17:48,277 --> 01:17:52,323
And it's great to be in the center of...
Center of that.

938
01:17:53,241 --> 01:17:58,621
Charlotte lived on site b
with all of us till the storm.

939
01:17:59,956 --> 01:18:01,833
She loved dinosaurs.

940
01:18:01,916 --> 01:18:04,127
- Charlotte, be careful.
- Yeah, lwi/I.

941
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:06,170
She grew up around scientists.

942
01:18:07,338 --> 01:18:08,506
And eventually...

943
01:18:10,508 --> 01:18:11,968
She became one herself.

944
01:18:12,051 --> 01:18:14,262
A butterfly flew
into my ofi'ice this morning.

945
01:18:14,846 --> 01:18:18,641
They say tiny things have huge impacts,
and I agree wholeheartedly.

946
01:18:18,725 --> 01:18:19,726
She was brilliant.

947
01:18:19,809 --> 01:18:22,478
For all my work with creatures,
wings flapping...

948
01:18:22,562 --> 01:18:24,188
In ways that I'll never be.

949
01:18:24,272 --> 01:18:28,067
In the metaphysics of identity,
can a replica truly be the original?

950
01:18:28,651 --> 01:18:31,612
And if it's possible, what makes it so?

951
01:18:36,993 --> 01:18:38,286
I've lost my pen.

952
01:18:41,914 --> 01:18:43,332
Is that me?

953
01:18:43,416 --> 01:18:45,835
Yeah.

954
01:18:45,918 --> 01:18:49,547
Just like blue, Charlotte was able
to have a child all by herself.

955
01:18:50,631 --> 01:18:54,135
She created you with her own DNA.

956
01:18:55,344 --> 01:18:57,472
So I do have a mother.

957
01:18:57,555 --> 01:19:00,725
Your grandfather didn't want
anyone to know the truth.

958
01:19:00,808 --> 01:19:03,352
He was protecting her, and you.

959
01:19:04,771 --> 01:19:06,022
And we're the same?

960
01:19:07,899 --> 01:19:09,233
You were.

961
01:19:09,984 --> 01:19:13,488
When you were a baby, Charlotte started
to show symptoms of a genetic disorder.

962
01:19:14,238 --> 01:19:16,240
That's how she died.

963
01:19:16,324 --> 01:19:18,951
She didn't know she had it
until after you were born.

964
01:19:20,161 --> 01:19:21,662
- Do I have it too?
- No.

965
01:19:23,122 --> 01:19:25,416
She changed your DNA.

966
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,046
She altered every cell in your body
to eradicate this disease.

967
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:33,299
No one on earth has ever known
how to do that.

968
01:19:34,091 --> 01:19:35,676
She fixed me.

969
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,262
Charlotte's discovery
is a part of you now.

970
01:19:40,389 --> 01:19:43,059
Your DNA could change the world.

971
01:19:43,893 --> 01:19:48,147
And I have to know how she did it,
but I just can't replicate her work.

972
01:19:48,231 --> 01:19:53,069
If I could just study you and beta,
whose DNA was never changed, I could...

973
01:19:55,738 --> 01:19:58,616
Fix a terrible mistake that I've made.

974
01:19:58,699 --> 01:20:00,493
What kind of mistake?

975
01:20:08,835 --> 01:20:11,003
Sub/e ve/ six. Restricted.

976
01:20:15,883 --> 01:20:16,884
Thanks for coming.

977
01:20:21,973 --> 01:20:25,101
- Which lab did Malcolm say?
- L4.

978
01:20:30,064 --> 01:20:31,065
This is it.

979
01:20:50,418 --> 01:20:54,213
Okay. Get in,
get the sample and get out.

980
01:20:54,297 --> 01:20:55,298
And move slow.

981
01:20:55,381 --> 01:20:57,842
They can swarm
at the slightest disturbance.

982
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:24,243
Orthoptera.

983
01:21:25,953 --> 01:21:27,038
Two weeks.

984
01:21:31,584 --> 01:21:33,836
Fully mature. This one.

985
01:21:35,046 --> 01:21:38,090
Ready? Easy.

986
01:21:42,887 --> 01:21:44,972
Okay. Go.

987
01:21:46,641 --> 01:21:47,642
What?

988
01:21:49,143 --> 01:21:50,436
Go get it.

989
01:21:52,563 --> 01:21:53,773
Is that necessary?

990
01:21:53,856 --> 01:21:56,275
Wh-what did you think was gonna happen?

991
01:21:56,359 --> 01:21:59,487
I have to take a sample.
We need concrete evidence. This is it.

992
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:02,698
Alan, you said there was no time.
Can you get it?

993
01:22:03,366 --> 01:22:04,617
Of course I can get it.

994
01:22:05,117 --> 01:22:07,036
Okay. Easy.

995
01:22:09,622 --> 01:22:10,748
Watch its legs.

996
01:22:11,415 --> 01:22:13,793
Ugh. Yech.

997
01:22:13,876 --> 01:22:15,336
Here we go.

998
01:22:17,338 --> 01:22:19,757
They're cell signaling between them.
This is not good, Ellie.

999
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,008
I almost got it.

1000
01:22:23,552 --> 01:22:27,556
How does she remain an asset, Henry,
if you're incriminating both of us

1001
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:30,101
by showing her classified things
on the computer?

1002
01:22:30,184 --> 01:22:33,521
Charlotte lockwood believed
the methods used at Jurassic park

1003
01:22:33,604 --> 01:22:34,605
could cure disease.

1004
01:22:35,272 --> 01:22:36,440
She was right.

1005
01:22:36,524 --> 01:22:40,695
Having filled the gaps
in ll/laisie's genome with altered DNA,

1006
01:22:40,778 --> 01:22:44,448
she used a pathogen to deliver
the repaired sequence to every cell

1007
01:22:45,157 --> 01:22:49,161
if / can repurpose what she did,
I could change the locust DNA,

1008
01:22:49,245 --> 01:22:51,497
eradicating them in a single generation.

1009
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:54,792
Il/laisie and the baby raptor
will provide the missing data.

1010
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,552
Hey, do you wanna get out of here?

1011
01:23:08,097 --> 01:23:09,765
What the...

1012
01:23:11,183 --> 01:23:12,543
Got it.

1013
01:23:20,568 --> 01:23:22,653
Oh, my god!

1014
01:23:22,737 --> 01:23:24,405
They're everywhere! Help me!

1015
01:23:25,364 --> 01:23:27,366
Oh, god! No!

1016
01:23:28,325 --> 01:23:31,704
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

1017
01:23:37,293 --> 01:23:38,794
Maisie.

1018
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:52,284
Asset containment breach.

1019
01:23:52,308 --> 01:23:53,768
Please remain at your stations.

1020
01:23:55,978 --> 01:23:58,856
Asset containment breach.
Please remain at your stations.

1021
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:02,651
Oh, my god.

1022
01:24:02,735 --> 01:24:04,779
- Oh, god. I can't see!
- Where's the key?

1023
01:24:08,616 --> 01:24:09,617
Oh, god!

1024
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:23,881
You okay?

1025
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:26,717
Yeah. You?

1026
01:24:27,676 --> 01:24:28,677
Yeah.

1027
01:24:31,347 --> 01:24:32,640
Oh.

1028
01:24:38,312 --> 01:24:42,858
You're Dr. Ellie sattler and Alan Grant.

1029
01:24:42,942 --> 01:24:44,401
You were at Jurassic park.

1030
01:24:45,653 --> 01:24:47,113
What are you doing here?

1031
01:24:47,196 --> 01:24:49,115
What? What...

1032
01:24:49,782 --> 01:24:50,950
What are you doing here?

1033
01:24:53,536 --> 01:24:54,829
I'm maisie lockwood.

1034
01:25:03,462 --> 01:25:07,716
Uh, hey, we don't, uh...

1035
01:25:08,759 --> 01:25:10,803
We're not...
We don't work for biosyn.

1036
01:25:10,886 --> 01:25:12,012
I can tell.

1037
01:25:12,096 --> 01:25:14,557
- We gotta get out of here.
- Yeah, we should go.

1038
01:25:30,614 --> 01:25:32,825
Okay. In and out.
We find your girl and go.

1039
01:25:34,577 --> 01:25:37,830
Tower, this is n141. Request to land
for freight delivery. Over.

1040
01:25:37,913 --> 01:25:39,415
N141, negative.

1041
01:25:39,498 --> 01:25:42,251
We've been advised you're carrying
unauthorized passengers. Over.

1042
01:25:42,751 --> 01:25:46,005
Copy that, tower.
Be advised sh/pment is perishable.

1043
01:25:46,088 --> 01:25:48,424
We need immediate clearance.
It's an emergency. Over.

1044
01:25:48,507 --> 01:25:49,508
There isn't... no.

1045
01:25:50,718 --> 01:25:52,678
Negative.
Return to point of origin.

1046
01:25:52,761 --> 01:25:55,806
You seem to be breaking up.
Are you hearing me on your side?

1047
01:25:55,890 --> 01:25:58,058
May need to check systems.

1048
01:25:58,142 --> 01:26:00,060
Nice try, Kayla.
They will down your bird.

1049
01:26:00,978 --> 01:26:03,272
Who is this? Is this Denise?

1050
01:26:03,355 --> 01:26:07,026
You do not want me to Stan' spilling
secrets, Denise. You remember Dubrovnik

1051
01:26:08,986 --> 01:26:09,987
she's...

1052
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:13,490
Different Denise, in accounts.

1053
01:26:21,373 --> 01:26:24,335
Talked to Santos.
It's the girl's parents.

1054
01:26:27,254 --> 01:26:28,923
Let's shut off the ads.

1055
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:30,633
Are you sure?

1056
01:26:31,842 --> 01:26:32,843
Uh-huh.

1057
01:26:39,975 --> 01:26:40,976
What's that?

1058
01:26:42,394 --> 01:26:44,730
That's the, uh...
That's the aerial deterrent system.

1059
01:26:44,813 --> 01:26:47,566
- Keeps the airborne life away.
- Why is it blinking?

1060
01:26:47,650 --> 01:26:49,693
Deadass Denise in the tower
just turned it off.

1061
01:26:49,777 --> 01:26:51,987
We gotta get out of this airspace
right now.

1062
01:26:56,367 --> 01:26:59,286
- That's another plane, right?
- Not exactly.

1063
01:27:02,915 --> 01:27:04,917
- Is that a...
- Quetzalcoatlus.

1064
01:27:05,542 --> 01:27:07,628
Late cretaceous,
should have stayed there.

1065
01:27:13,801 --> 01:27:16,262
Okay. Okay.

1066
01:27:16,345 --> 01:27:18,389
It's cool. We're good. It's gone.

1067
01:27:35,698 --> 01:27:37,157
This plane is going down!

1068
01:27:37,241 --> 01:27:40,286
If you're gonna eject,
you need to do it now!

1069
01:27:40,369 --> 01:27:43,372
- I only got one chair, and she's in it.
- You don't have parachutes?

1070
01:27:43,455 --> 01:27:45,624
I wasn't expecting company!

1071
01:27:53,424 --> 01:27:56,176
Claire! We gotta get you off this plane.

1072
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:57,344
What?

1073
01:27:57,428 --> 01:27:59,138
The parachute is gonna open automatically.

1074
01:27:59,221 --> 01:28:01,974
If it doesn't, you pull this lever.
Do you understand me?

1075
01:28:02,057 --> 01:28:04,310
Claire!
If it doesn't open automatically,

1076
01:28:04,393 --> 01:28:06,395
you're gonna pull
this lever behind you. Okay?

1077
01:28:06,478 --> 01:28:07,938
Ten thousand feet!

1078
01:28:08,022 --> 01:28:10,024
Hey, you're the one
who's gotta go to get to her.

1079
01:28:10,107 --> 01:28:12,067
You're her mom.
You're her only shot.

1080
01:28:15,279 --> 01:28:16,280
I'll see you again.

1081
01:28:18,365 --> 01:28:19,366
I love you.

1082
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:10,209
What's the plan?

1083
01:29:10,292 --> 01:29:13,212
Whatever happens. That's the plan.

1084
01:29:27,601 --> 01:29:28,769
- Three.
- This way.

1085
01:29:29,728 --> 01:29:32,314
- Alan, we need the code.
- Let's try this thing.

1086
01:29:32,398 --> 01:29:33,398
Yeah.

1087
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,359
Get down.

1088
01:29:41,115 --> 01:29:43,534
- Thank god it's you!
- I know.

1089
01:29:43,617 --> 01:29:45,369
- This place is a maze.
- Good you're here.

1090
01:29:45,452 --> 01:29:47,579
We were so confused.
I thought we were lost.

1091
01:29:47,663 --> 01:29:49,832
Then you said station three.
And I was like, here...

1092
01:29:49,915 --> 01:29:51,125
Do you have the sample?

1093
01:29:51,875 --> 01:29:53,315
- What?
- What are you talking about?

1094
01:29:53,377 --> 01:29:55,129
The DNA sample. Do you have it?

1095
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:57,756
Biosyn's responsible
for the locust epidemic.

1096
01:29:57,840 --> 01:29:59,925
Dodgson's covering it up.
You were right.

1097
01:30:00,008 --> 01:30:01,468
I'm here to help you.

1098
01:30:01,552 --> 01:30:02,636
Do you have it?

1099
01:30:03,595 --> 01:30:04,596
Yeah.

1100
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:05,681
Good.

1101
01:30:06,682 --> 01:30:08,434
This pod will take you
to the airfield.

1102
01:30:08,517 --> 01:30:10,144
We have a plane ready to fly.

1103
01:30:10,227 --> 01:30:12,646
- Ian told you about hexapod allies?
- No.

1104
01:30:12,729 --> 01:30:13,897
I told him.

1105
01:30:13,981 --> 01:30:14,982
What?

1106
01:30:15,566 --> 01:30:17,568
- Okay. You guys gotta go.
- Wait.

1107
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:23,240
Maisie.

1108
01:30:26,952 --> 01:30:27,953
Maisie lockwood.

1109
01:34:39,705 --> 01:34:41,915
Okay.

1110
01:34:47,254 --> 01:34:48,797
That was my baby.

1111
01:34:50,424 --> 01:34:52,175
Okay, okay.

1112
01:34:57,347 --> 01:34:59,224
Where'd you learn to fly?

1113
01:34:59,307 --> 01:35:02,728
Uh, air force.
Legacy on my mama's side.

1114
01:35:02,811 --> 01:35:04,146
Yeah. I'm Navy.

1115
01:35:05,063 --> 01:35:07,441
Okay, so how'd you end up doing this?

1116
01:35:07,524 --> 01:35:09,526
I was a legit contract pilot
for a grip,

1117
01:35:09,609 --> 01:35:12,487
but it didn't exactly pay enough
to be out here sending money home.

1118
01:35:12,571 --> 01:35:15,323
So I hit up a few contacts
for the more lucrative shady shit.

1119
01:35:16,575 --> 01:35:19,327
Honestly, I might be done
with this line of work.

1120
01:35:19,911 --> 01:35:21,204
Is that why you're helping us?

1121
01:35:24,666 --> 01:35:27,377
I was there
when they handed your girl off to biosyn.

1122
01:35:28,670 --> 01:35:32,132
I could have said something, but I didn't.

1123
01:35:32,215 --> 01:35:33,925
And when I saw her picture...

1124
01:35:36,428 --> 01:35:37,679
It isn't enough to do nothing.

1125
01:35:43,643 --> 01:35:44,728
Thank you.

1126
01:36:31,733 --> 01:36:32,734
No.

1127
01:36:37,531 --> 01:36:38,532
Nope.

1128
01:37:02,848 --> 01:37:04,099
What an asshole.

1129
01:37:55,567 --> 01:37:56,568
You good?

1130
01:37:57,152 --> 01:37:59,821
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm not shook at all. You?

1131
01:37:59,905 --> 01:38:01,907
Nah. Nah, no.

1132
01:38:04,492 --> 01:38:06,703
Ejection seat beacon.
We'll find her.

1133
01:38:06,786 --> 01:38:08,747
Okay, okay.

1134
01:38:08,830 --> 01:38:10,081
You really love her, huh?

1135
01:38:12,167 --> 01:38:13,168
Yeah.

1136
01:38:13,877 --> 01:38:14,878
I get it.

1137
01:38:16,254 --> 01:38:17,881
I like redheads too.

1138
01:38:19,132 --> 01:38:20,592
What? God.

1139
01:38:24,721 --> 01:38:27,223
- Who is that?
- It's Grant and sattler.

1140
01:38:27,307 --> 01:38:29,559
- Is this live?
- Twelve minutes ago.

1141
01:38:29,643 --> 01:38:32,520
We were tracking the escaped asset.
My guys missed it.

1142
01:38:32,604 --> 01:38:34,481
They stole a DNA sample.

1143
01:38:35,065 --> 01:38:36,232
How'd they get in there?

1144
01:38:36,316 --> 01:38:38,944
They used an access key.
Yankee white clearance.

1145
01:38:40,403 --> 01:38:43,782
One of our cameras saw Ian Malcolm
put something in sattler's pocket.

1146
01:38:44,741 --> 01:38:47,827
All right.
I want to see him.

1147
01:38:47,911 --> 01:38:49,704
And get ramsay up here too,
will you?

1148
01:38:51,164 --> 01:38:53,792
- Where are they now?
- On the way to the airfield.

1149
01:38:53,875 --> 01:38:55,919
They caught the hyperloop
right on schedule.

1150
01:39:02,092 --> 01:39:03,093
How are you?

1151
01:39:04,302 --> 01:39:06,054
You all right?

1152
01:39:07,138 --> 01:39:08,390
Not really, no.

1153
01:39:10,767 --> 01:39:11,768
Hey.

1154
01:39:12,602 --> 01:39:14,938
I, uh, knew your mom.

1155
01:39:18,525 --> 01:39:19,567
You did?

1156
01:39:19,651 --> 01:39:20,944
Mm-hmm.

1157
01:39:22,445 --> 01:39:25,365
Yeah, a few years
after Hammond died,

1158
01:39:26,199 --> 01:39:29,160
she came to my university to lecture,

1159
01:39:29,244 --> 01:39:32,247
and we became good friends.

1160
01:39:32,330 --> 01:39:34,374
What was she like?

1161
01:39:34,457 --> 01:39:35,542
Brilliant.

1162
01:39:35,625 --> 01:39:38,753
Light-years ahead
of everybody else.

1163
01:39:38,837 --> 01:39:41,047
And she had a conscience.

1164
01:39:41,131 --> 01:39:43,258
While they were out
building theme parks,

1165
01:39:43,341 --> 01:39:47,012
well, she was determined to prove
that genetic power could save lives.

1166
01:39:48,638 --> 01:39:50,015
And I was her experiment.

1167
01:39:53,768 --> 01:39:56,521
She wanted a child more than anything.

1168
01:39:56,604 --> 01:39:59,733
But she wanted you to have
what she couldn't.

1169
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:02,444
A full life.

1170
01:40:05,321 --> 01:40:07,282
I didn't know her long,

1171
01:40:08,199 --> 01:40:10,493
but I know she loved you very much.

1172
01:40:30,972 --> 01:40:32,140
What's happening?

1173
01:40:39,773 --> 01:40:41,983
This must be the old Amber mines.

1174
01:40:42,067 --> 01:40:43,610
We're inside the mountain.

1175
01:40:43,693 --> 01:40:46,321
They must've made access doors
when they built these tunnels.

1176
01:40:48,448 --> 01:40:49,449
You ready?

1177
01:40:50,867 --> 01:40:51,910
I'm good.

1178
01:40:52,786 --> 01:40:54,204
No, that's not reasonable.

1179
01:40:54,287 --> 01:40:56,206
You want to go into the dark tunnel.

1180
01:40:56,748 --> 01:40:58,792
I want to stay in the bulletproof tube.

1181
01:40:59,417 --> 01:41:00,752
Who's being unreasonable?

1182
01:41:01,586 --> 01:41:04,672
But the bulletproof tube has no door.

1183
01:41:08,426 --> 01:41:09,636
Look, uh_.

1184
01:41:13,098 --> 01:41:16,684
I know how you feel.
It's... it's scary. It is.

1185
01:41:17,477 --> 01:41:20,855
But trust me, moving fonnard
is better than staying still.

1186
01:41:20,939 --> 01:41:24,317
And Dr. Sattler here is
a good person in a tight spot,

1187
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,194
and this is a tight spot.

1188
01:41:26,277 --> 01:41:28,071
So, you coming?

1189
01:41:31,783 --> 01:41:32,909
All right.

1190
01:41:58,393 --> 01:42:01,062
Hey, I heard the alarm.
Everything all right?

1191
01:42:01,145 --> 01:42:04,566
Yeah. No, no.
Nothing we can't, uh, handle. Listen...

1192
01:42:05,233 --> 01:42:06,734
- You rang?
- Oh, good.

1193
01:42:06,818 --> 01:42:09,195
Dr. Malcolm, you are...

1194
01:42:09,279 --> 01:42:11,447
- Fi red.
- What?

1195
01:42:12,282 --> 01:42:14,951
It was such a cushy gig.

1196
01:42:15,034 --> 01:42:19,539
You can give your access key to security
if you still have it.

1197
01:42:19,622 --> 01:42:22,208
One of the hyperloop pods
just shut down in the Amber mines.

1198
01:42:22,292 --> 01:42:23,751
What?

1199
01:42:23,835 --> 01:42:26,170
Wow. This day.

1200
01:42:26,254 --> 01:42:28,131
Uh, which... which pod are we...

1201
01:42:28,214 --> 01:42:29,299
Are there, um...

1202
01:42:30,633 --> 01:42:32,051
Dinosaurs in the mines?

1203
01:42:32,135 --> 01:42:33,636
There are dinosaurs everywhere.

1204
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:36,347
Technically, birds are dinosaurs,
g-genetically speaking at least.

1205
01:42:36,431 --> 01:42:38,600
Okay.
Lewis, Grant and sattler are in this pod.

1206
01:42:38,683 --> 01:42:41,728
- We need to send a security team asap.
- Absolutely, ramsay. Thank you.

1207
01:42:41,811 --> 01:42:44,814
Let's all just stay in our lanes though.
We can take care of it.

1208
01:42:44,898 --> 01:42:46,024
Thank you, doctor.

1209
01:42:46,107 --> 01:42:48,526
That's it, huh?
Nothing else to see here?

1210
01:42:48,610 --> 01:42:52,697
Uh, I'm not sure
I admire your tone right now.

1211
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:54,300
- You need to leave.
- Yeah, I do.

1212
01:42:54,324 --> 01:42:57,702
But first,
I owe all these folks an apology.

1213
01:42:57,785 --> 01:43:00,580
I think that by lending my cachet
to this joint,

1214
01:43:00,663 --> 01:43:03,458
I might've made it seem
as if biosyn wasn't rotten to the core.

1215
01:43:03,541 --> 01:43:04,709
That's enough, Ian.

1216
01:43:04,792 --> 01:43:05,960
See, here's how they get you.

1217
01:43:06,044 --> 01:43:08,325
They give you so many promotions
in a short period of time

1218
01:43:08,379 --> 01:43:10,715
that it bludgeons your capacity
for critical thinking.

1219
01:43:10,798 --> 01:43:11,799
Oh, my god.

1220
01:43:11,883 --> 01:43:15,053
Then there are doors that you don't open,
things that you ignore.

1221
01:43:15,136 --> 01:43:20,683
But mainly, he's exploiting
your enchantment with these.

1222
01:43:20,767 --> 01:43:22,769
Is there an actual concern here,
or are you just...

1223
01:43:22,852 --> 01:43:26,898
You're racing toward the extinction
of our species, and you don't care.

1224
01:43:26,981 --> 01:43:30,026
You know exactly what you're doing,
but you won't stop.

1225
01:43:30,109 --> 01:43:31,152
You can't.

1226
01:43:31,736 --> 01:43:34,989
I thought you might be different,
but you're just like everyone else.

1227
01:43:35,073 --> 01:43:36,532
You see what you want to see.

1228
01:43:36,616 --> 01:43:40,787
You imagine unchecked avarice,
so that's what you find.

1229
01:43:40,870 --> 01:43:44,791
You envision, what,
an evil, unbound prometheus,

1230
01:43:44,874 --> 01:43:47,210
- so that's what I am to you?
- Prometheus got gored.

1231
01:43:47,293 --> 01:43:50,338
So will you, you rapacious rat bastard.

1232
01:43:50,421 --> 01:43:54,050
Ramsay, will you help Dr. Malcolm
gather his things?

1233
01:43:55,051 --> 01:43:57,261
His room, and then to the airfield.
That's it.

1234
01:44:07,188 --> 01:44:08,189
Dodgson.

1235
01:45:41,657 --> 01:45:43,451
Allosaurus?

1236
01:45:44,994 --> 01:45:46,621
Giganotosaurus.

1237
01:45:46,704 --> 01:45:48,623
Largest known terrestrial carnivore.

1238
01:45:49,499 --> 01:45:51,959
He put two apex predators in one valley.

1239
01:45:52,043 --> 01:45:53,920
Pretty soon there's only gonna be one.

1240
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:27,120
Did you feel that?

1241
01:46:29,122 --> 01:46:30,289
That's an air current.

1242
01:46:30,998 --> 01:46:32,834
Must be an opening up ahead.

1243
01:46:34,001 --> 01:46:36,087
How old is this mine,
do you think?

1244
01:46:36,170 --> 01:46:37,964
Just breathe.

1245
01:46:38,047 --> 01:46:40,424
Nobody panic.
Just watch out for bats.

1246
01:46:40,508 --> 01:46:42,308
- Who said anything about bats?
- I hate bats.

1247
01:46:42,385 --> 01:46:44,804
Well, there's probably no bats.
No falling rocks.

1248
01:46:45,388 --> 01:46:48,307
Just a possibility of toxic gas,
dehydration, hypothermia.

1249
01:46:48,391 --> 01:46:50,643
Just possibilities, nothing for certain.

1250
01:46:50,726 --> 01:46:53,896
I should've left you where you were.
Why did I bring you into this?

1251
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:56,858
- You were happy in your element.
- What? What? Ellie.

1252
01:46:56,941 --> 01:46:57,942
What?

1253
01:46:58,776 --> 01:46:59,944
I wasn't happy.

1254
01:47:01,529 --> 01:47:02,655
You weren't?

1255
01:47:02,738 --> 01:47:04,740
- Do you guys have kids?
- What?

1256
01:47:05,616 --> 01:47:08,828
Uh... no. I-I do. Two.

1257
01:47:09,412 --> 01:47:10,454
But not with him?

1258
01:47:12,373 --> 01:47:15,042
No.

1259
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:18,337
No, just old friends.

1260
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:20,798
Uh, just old friends.

1261
01:47:22,008 --> 01:47:23,009
Really?

1262
01:47:28,055 --> 01:47:30,183
Won't be long
before security knows you're gone.

1263
01:47:30,766 --> 01:47:33,561
A map. That looks like an old map.
You don't have a new map?

1264
01:47:33,644 --> 01:47:36,522
There's an access gate
at the northeast corner of the mine.

1265
01:47:36,606 --> 01:47:38,232
- If your friends make it out...
- If?

1266
01:47:38,316 --> 01:47:39,775
- When they make it out.
- Yes, sir.

1267
01:47:39,859 --> 01:47:41,110
That's where they'll be.

1268
01:47:41,861 --> 01:47:43,988
These roads are protected, right?

1269
01:47:44,071 --> 01:47:45,323
Uh, yeah, I'd drive fast.

1270
01:47:57,168 --> 01:47:58,169
You did good.

1271
01:47:58,252 --> 01:48:01,839
Yeah. Well, actually,
it's a complete disaster, but thanks.

1272
01:48:02,965 --> 01:48:04,008
Not yet.

1273
01:48:41,003 --> 01:48:42,380
Lewis?

1274
01:48:42,463 --> 01:48:44,548
What? What are you doing down here?

1275
01:48:46,592 --> 01:48:48,010
Actually, no. This is good.

1276
01:48:48,094 --> 01:48:51,097
You sent a rescue team
into the mines for Grant and sattler?

1277
01:48:51,180 --> 01:48:52,848
Yeah. What? Okay. Of course. Yeah.

1278
01:48:52,932 --> 01:48:56,352
- Are you deleting research files?
- Uh, we are. Yes.

1279
01:48:56,435 --> 01:48:59,063
You and I got to protect
what we've built, right?

1280
01:48:59,146 --> 01:49:01,983
You think they wouldn't love
to get their hands in here?

1281
01:49:02,066 --> 01:49:05,486
Take all the resources
I've spent decades collecting.

1282
01:49:05,569 --> 01:49:06,821
Just because, what?

1283
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:09,657
We made a bad call? It happens.

1284
01:49:10,283 --> 01:49:11,284
Seven.

1285
01:49:14,203 --> 01:49:15,204
Hexapod allies.

1286
01:49:15,955 --> 01:49:17,832
What? Oh.

1287
01:49:19,625 --> 01:49:22,461
Okay. What do people know?

1288
01:49:22,545 --> 01:49:25,881
The locusts were designed to spread
genetic modifications to crops.

1289
01:49:26,966 --> 01:49:29,969
Protection against droughts,
frost, disease. A breakthrough.

1290
01:49:30,052 --> 01:49:32,471
- Goddamn right it was.
- Yeah. Only it didn't work.

1291
01:49:32,555 --> 01:49:35,475
You ensured they can't eat biosyn seed,
so they're eating everything else.

1292
01:49:35,558 --> 01:49:37,518
Which I did not see coming.
We have a solution.

1293
01:49:37,601 --> 01:49:39,841
- Independent farmers suffered at first.
- Henry's on it.

1294
01:49:39,895 --> 01:49:42,732
Nobody cared much. Now the world's
food supply is verging on collapse.

1295
01:49:42,815 --> 01:49:44,400
Find the girl, change the locusts' DNA.

1296
01:49:44,483 --> 01:49:46,944
- The trail's gonna lead back to you.
- We solve the problem.

1297
01:49:47,028 --> 01:49:48,446
Ramsay, thank you.

1298
01:49:51,365 --> 01:49:54,827
Disappears in the next news cycle,
just like everything else. This is not it.

1299
01:49:55,494 --> 01:49:56,495
81c1.

1300
01:49:56,579 --> 01:49:59,290
Or you could accept responsibility.

1301
01:50:00,708 --> 01:50:02,209
Share your research with the world.

1302
01:50:02,293 --> 01:50:03,294
Yep.

1303
01:50:04,754 --> 01:50:06,380
You know, I was 28 once. I get it.

1304
01:50:07,757 --> 01:50:08,966
You look around, you...

1305
01:50:09,633 --> 01:50:13,220
Realize you're surrounded by injustice
and cruelty and you wanna change it.

1306
01:50:13,304 --> 01:50:14,305
Yep.

1307
01:50:15,139 --> 01:50:16,974
And then you grow up,

1308
01:50:17,058 --> 01:50:19,268
somebody puts you in charge,

1309
01:50:20,353 --> 01:50:22,605
and you see that there is no changing it.

1310
01:50:25,649 --> 01:50:26,984
It's chomp or be chomped.

1311
01:50:28,611 --> 01:50:30,654
- Where are you going with that?
- Oh.

1312
01:50:31,530 --> 01:50:34,450
We don't apologize for our mistakes.
We erase them.

1313
01:50:35,785 --> 01:50:37,453
Stay on your phone. I may need you.

1314
01:50:45,669 --> 01:50:46,879
Watch yourself.

1315
01:51:06,148 --> 01:51:07,608
- Ellie?
- Yeah.

1316
01:51:12,822 --> 01:51:13,823
What was that?

1317
01:51:20,996 --> 01:51:22,123
Be careful.

1318
01:51:36,429 --> 01:51:38,347
Oh, my god. Are you okay?

1319
01:51:56,824 --> 01:51:57,950
Forget the hat!

1320
01:51:59,410 --> 01:52:01,078
Come on!

1321
01:52:08,836 --> 01:52:09,837
Go, go, go!

1322
01:52:10,838 --> 01:52:12,381
Go, go, go, go, go!

1323
01:52:15,176 --> 01:52:16,469
There's no button.

1324
01:52:17,261 --> 01:52:18,262
It's a car.

1325
01:52:20,264 --> 01:52:22,266
- Oh, my god. Ian!
- Ian, over here!

1326
01:52:23,893 --> 01:52:25,036
- Help!
- Please!

1327
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:26,896
- Open the gate!
- Please help us!

1328
01:52:27,855 --> 01:52:30,455
- Do you know the code?
- I didn't know there was gonna be a code.

1329
01:52:31,817 --> 01:52:34,278
I didn't know there was gonna be a code.

1330
01:52:34,361 --> 01:52:35,905
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

1331
01:52:37,865 --> 01:52:39,200
The brake! Pull the brake!

1332
01:52:39,283 --> 01:52:41,035
There are 10,000 possibilities.

1333
01:52:41,118 --> 01:52:42,286
Push your legs against it!

1334
01:52:43,579 --> 01:52:46,207
- 1984.
- Come on, Ian!

1335
01:52:46,290 --> 01:52:48,584
- Kick up against it!
- Hurry!

1336
01:52:49,084 --> 01:52:52,463
Miles Davis's birthday, 0526.

1337
01:52:57,259 --> 01:52:58,511
- Ian!
- Please. Please.

1338
01:52:58,594 --> 01:53:01,263
- Do something!
- We're not gonna make it.

1339
01:53:01,347 --> 01:53:03,349
Let's... let's all try to stay positive.

1340
01:53:19,657 --> 01:53:22,660
- Please!
- I know. I know. I know!

1341
01:53:28,916 --> 01:53:30,376
Oh, my god!

1342
01:53:32,002 --> 01:53:33,796
What do you know?
It actually worked.

1343
01:53:40,094 --> 01:53:42,429
- Ian, this is maisie.
- Hi, maisie.

1344
01:53:42,513 --> 01:53:44,098
We got the DNA.

1345
01:53:45,724 --> 01:53:47,643
- We need to get out of this valley.
- Yeah.

1346
01:53:47,726 --> 01:53:49,478
- Come on. Come on.
- Let's go. Let's go.

1347
01:54:20,801 --> 01:54:22,469
Come on. Come on.

1348
01:55:32,289 --> 01:55:33,749
Go on. Get!

1349
01:55:34,917 --> 01:55:35,918
Yuck.

1350
01:55:36,001 --> 01:55:37,878
Hey.

1351
01:55:37,961 --> 01:55:39,254
Oh, my god.

1352
01:55:40,255 --> 01:55:41,965
I thought you were dead.

1353
01:55:42,049 --> 01:55:43,300
What do they even eat?

1354
01:55:48,472 --> 01:55:49,681
We better get inside.

1355
01:56:10,160 --> 01:56:11,286
Go ahead.

1356
01:56:50,701 --> 01:56:53,036
Containment chamber compromised.

1357
01:57:08,927 --> 01:57:10,053
Itslocked.

1358
01:57:10,137 --> 01:57:12,431
Gonna need something heavy,
something sharp, or both.

1359
01:57:24,234 --> 01:57:26,695
That can't be right.

1360
01:57:38,457 --> 01:57:40,000
- Is that...
- Oh, no.

1361
01:57:40,792 --> 01:57:42,294
Oh, my god.

1362
01:57:44,630 --> 01:57:46,256
He's burning the evidence.

1363
01:57:47,216 --> 01:57:50,469
- "Oh, my god. Oh, my god! Oh, my"
- that's bananas.

1364
01:58:06,652 --> 01:58:09,404
Oh, my god.

1365
01:58:09,488 --> 01:58:14,409
I... I know that
this may seem precarious, but...

1366
01:58:15,577 --> 01:58:16,703
No, we're teetering.

1367
01:58:19,540 --> 01:58:21,625
Shouldn't we all lean
to the left or something?

1368
01:58:21,708 --> 01:58:23,877
That's a very constructive...
Thank you, maisie.

1369
01:58:23,961 --> 01:58:25,379
Yeah.

1370
01:58:25,462 --> 01:58:27,297
Slow. Slow.

1371
01:58:29,633 --> 01:58:30,634
Slow.

1372
01:58:33,011 --> 01:58:34,763
Yay.

1373
01:58:34,846 --> 01:58:37,432
- We're fine. See this?
- Mm-hmm.

1374
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:39,601
- This is fine.
- Mm-hmm.

1375
01:58:53,699 --> 01:58:54,992
Alan?

1376
01:58:55,075 --> 01:58:57,369
Alan!

1377
01:58:57,452 --> 01:58:58,453
How is everybody?

1378
01:59:08,255 --> 01:59:10,382
It's my parents.

1379
01:59:11,633 --> 01:59:13,010
Help!

1380
01:59:13,594 --> 01:59:15,220
- Help!
- Listen.

1381
01:59:15,846 --> 01:59:17,097
Help!

1382
01:59:19,057 --> 01:59:20,058
Oh, god.

1383
01:59:23,604 --> 01:59:24,605
Oh, my god.

1384
01:59:25,397 --> 01:59:26,648
You're okay.

1385
01:59:27,774 --> 01:59:29,151
You're okay.

1386
01:59:29,234 --> 01:59:31,987
You came to get me. You actually...
You came to get me.

1387
01:59:32,070 --> 01:59:34,323
Of course we did, sweetheart.

1388
01:59:34,406 --> 01:59:35,907
- Hey.
- Of course.

1389
01:59:38,327 --> 01:59:39,411
I remember you.

1390
01:59:41,413 --> 01:59:43,081
Remember you too.

1391
01:59:53,175 --> 01:59:54,760
They helped me escape.

1392
01:59:55,510 --> 01:59:56,511
Yeah?

1393
02:00:00,223 --> 02:00:01,224
You okay?

1394
02:00:04,519 --> 02:00:05,979
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1395
02:00:08,607 --> 02:00:09,900
We gotta go.

1396
02:00:10,651 --> 02:00:12,986
Gonna have to break a window
to get inside that thing.

1397
02:00:14,154 --> 02:00:15,781
Hope nobody is afraid of heights.

1398
02:00:28,835 --> 02:00:30,420
- Don't move.
- Don't move.

1399
02:00:49,064 --> 02:00:50,232
What is that?

1400
02:00:51,024 --> 02:00:52,317
Giganotosaurus.

1401
02:00:54,653 --> 02:00:56,822
Biggest carnivore the world has ever seen.

1402
02:01:16,091 --> 02:01:18,009
Maisie, maisie.
Look at me. Look at me.

1403
02:01:41,658 --> 02:01:42,659
Go.

1404
02:01:58,258 --> 02:01:59,968
- Go, go, go.
- Come on!

1405
02:02:06,099 --> 02:02:07,100
No! No, no, no.

1406
02:02:11,563 --> 02:02:13,607
- Hustle!
- I'm gonna die!

1407
02:02:13,690 --> 02:02:15,025
- Climb! Climb, kid!
- No!

1408
02:02:15,108 --> 02:02:17,152
You're not. No, you're not.
You're okay.

1409
02:02:26,203 --> 02:02:27,204
Go, go, go.

1410
02:02:45,096 --> 02:02:46,348
Come on.

1411
02:02:55,690 --> 02:02:57,359
Oh, yeah. Come here.

1412
02:03:14,167 --> 02:03:15,335
Help me open it.

1413
02:03:21,591 --> 02:03:22,759
I got ya.

1414
02:03:23,635 --> 02:03:25,387
Go, go, go.

1415
02:03:25,470 --> 02:03:26,471
Go, go, go!

1416
02:03:29,599 --> 02:03:30,600
Run!

1417
02:03:47,450 --> 02:03:49,119
See? Not so bad.

1418
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:56,750
Come on.

1419
02:03:57,836 --> 02:03:59,504
- Owen!
- Claire!

1420
02:04:43,089 --> 02:04:46,134
Call an evacuation.
We need to bring the animals inside.

1421
02:04:46,217 --> 02:04:48,845
The regulations are clear
that in the event of a level two...

1422
02:04:48,929 --> 02:04:50,347
Shh!

1423
02:04:52,057 --> 02:04:53,058
Jeffrey.

1424
02:04:58,772 --> 02:04:59,773
God...

1425
02:05:00,523 --> 02:05:01,524
Damn it!

1426
02:05:04,110 --> 02:05:05,111
Just...

1427
02:05:06,529 --> 02:05:08,406
Just call it.

1428
02:05:08,490 --> 02:05:12,077
Attention, attention.
This is an immediate evacuation order.

1429
02:05:12,160 --> 02:05:14,287
Remote herding system
is now active.

1430
02:05:14,371 --> 02:05:17,624
All living assets en route
to emergency containment.

1431
02:05:40,522 --> 02:05:44,442
I can't get hold of anybody
since everything is on fire.

1432
02:05:45,110 --> 02:05:47,529
- Dr. Sattler, get some water.
- Oh, thanks.

1433
02:05:47,612 --> 02:05:49,739
Dr. Grant? Here you are.

1434
02:05:49,823 --> 02:05:52,742
I'm Owen Grady.
Big fan. I read your book.

1435
02:05:53,368 --> 02:05:54,786
Well, book on tape.

1436
02:05:54,869 --> 02:05:58,581
Owen Grady. Owen Grady.
Yeah, I know who you are.

1437
02:05:59,499 --> 02:06:01,334
You trained raptors.

1438
02:06:01,418 --> 02:06:04,421
I tried. Yeah.

1439
02:06:04,504 --> 02:06:06,589
- How you doing?
- The one here.

1440
02:06:07,674 --> 02:06:09,509
You were at Jurassic world.

1441
02:06:10,093 --> 02:06:13,805
Jurassic world? Not a fan.
Mm-mmm.

1442
02:06:14,639 --> 02:06:17,726
Okay.
So, we good to find a way out of here?

1443
02:06:17,809 --> 02:06:20,103
- Yep.
- Let's get it.

1444
02:06:20,186 --> 02:06:23,440
There's a helicopter
out in the main complex.

1445
02:06:23,523 --> 02:06:26,192
We turn the ads back on, we go home.

1446
02:06:26,276 --> 02:06:28,737
- Wait. What's an ads?
- Aerial deterrent system.

1447
02:06:30,363 --> 02:06:32,782
You know?
For the pterodactyls and shit.

1448
02:06:32,866 --> 02:06:34,659
Keeps them away from the helicopters.

1449
02:06:34,743 --> 02:06:36,411
Well, how do we turn it back on?

1450
02:06:36,494 --> 02:06:39,581
It looks like all the systems
run through to the control room,

1451
02:06:39,664 --> 02:06:40,915
which is on the third floor.

1452
02:06:42,333 --> 02:06:44,544
These outposts
are all connected underground.

1453
02:06:50,216 --> 02:06:51,885
All right. Easy, Rambo.

1454
02:07:02,103 --> 02:07:03,980
So you worked
in the raptor pen, huh?

1455
02:07:04,898 --> 02:07:06,441
Yeah.

1456
02:07:06,524 --> 02:07:07,609
Wow. And what happens?

1457
02:07:07,692 --> 02:07:10,945
Do you just tell them what to do
and they comply? Or...

1458
02:07:12,155 --> 02:07:15,867
Well, it's a human-animal bond
based on mutual respect.

1459
02:07:15,950 --> 02:07:17,410
Mm-hmm.

1460
02:07:18,495 --> 02:07:20,622
I had a dog once.

1461
02:07:20,705 --> 02:07:25,376
Humped my leg so much
I got a callus on my shinbone.

1462
02:07:25,460 --> 02:07:26,711
That's a true story.

1463
02:07:42,477 --> 02:07:44,854
Oh, god. Hey. Good.

1464
02:07:47,107 --> 02:07:49,818
Here's what I'm thinking.
We get started again.

1465
02:07:49,901 --> 02:07:51,903
You and me. I can get money.

1466
02:07:53,488 --> 02:07:55,865
Yeah. Money's cheap these days.

1467
02:07:55,949 --> 02:07:58,993
Wh-what's the matter?
Don't look so worried. There's...

1468
02:07:59,077 --> 02:08:03,289
There's opportunity in everything.
E-Even this. You'll learn that.

1469
02:08:04,040 --> 02:08:07,877
I've been thinking,
maybe you take more of a lead now. Okay?

1470
02:08:08,753 --> 02:08:09,838
You're ready, I think.

1471
02:08:10,380 --> 02:08:11,381
Here, take...

1472
02:08:12,006 --> 02:08:13,675
What the hell
is the matter with you?

1473
02:08:23,309 --> 02:08:24,310
It was you.

1474
02:08:25,103 --> 02:08:27,647
You told Malcolm
about the program. Y-You...

1475
02:08:28,648 --> 02:08:31,401
You set this whole thing up.
You set me up.

1476
02:08:32,318 --> 02:08:34,696
I gave you every opportunity
I did not have. I...

1477
02:08:36,155 --> 02:08:40,785
We have an understanding, ramsay.
And you do not break that.

1478
02:08:43,580 --> 02:08:45,206
I would not break this.

1479
02:08:48,543 --> 02:08:49,878
I'm not you.

1480
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:04,017
Uh-oh.

1481
02:09:05,059 --> 02:09:06,686
This is very bad.

1482
02:09:08,521 --> 02:09:10,523
This is the same system
we used at the park.

1483
02:09:10,607 --> 02:09:15,403
Great. So we can turn on the thing
and then we all get out of here?

1484
02:09:15,486 --> 02:09:17,280
Let's see. Ads...

1485
02:09:18,448 --> 02:09:20,408
What's this? What's "error 99"?

1486
02:09:20,491 --> 02:09:22,410
Not enough power.

1487
02:09:22,493 --> 02:09:24,287
In a breakdown,
all available power is seized

1488
02:09:24,370 --> 02:09:26,539
by the primary system to keep running.

1489
02:09:26,623 --> 02:09:28,791
We need all that power
to reactivate the ads.

1490
02:09:28,875 --> 02:09:30,919
The system's safety feature
is what's gonna kill us?

1491
02:09:31,002 --> 02:09:32,295
Of course.

1492
02:09:32,378 --> 02:09:34,213
- How do we get more power?
- We can't.

1493
02:09:34,297 --> 02:09:36,132
But we can redistribute what we have.

1494
02:09:36,215 --> 02:09:38,135
- Just need to...
- Shut down the primary system.

1495
02:09:38,217 --> 02:09:39,427
- Yes. Exactly.
- Where is it?

1496
02:09:39,510 --> 02:09:41,638
- Uh, next floor up.
- I'm coming with you.

1497
02:09:41,721 --> 02:09:43,139
We escaped down here.

1498
02:09:44,307 --> 02:09:47,977
- Where is that? Water treatment center?
- Hydroelectric system. Sub eight.

1499
02:09:48,061 --> 02:09:49,687
Give me eight minutes.
I could find her.

1500
02:09:49,771 --> 02:09:50,855
Wait. Who's this now?

1501
02:09:50,939 --> 02:09:52,941
Beta. Blue's baby.

1502
02:09:53,024 --> 02:09:54,525
Velociraptor.

1503
02:09:54,609 --> 02:09:56,194
- What?
- A baby raptor?

1504
02:09:56,277 --> 02:09:57,987
You gave her a name.
How about that?

1505
02:09:58,071 --> 02:09:59,864
I made a promise
we would bring her home.

1506
02:09:59,948 --> 02:10:02,825
You made a promise
to a dinosaur.

1507
02:10:02,909 --> 02:10:04,535
You're coming with us, right?

1508
02:10:04,619 --> 02:10:06,204
Maisie, I...

1509
02:10:06,287 --> 02:10:07,330
Please.

1510
02:10:10,750 --> 02:10:12,585
- I'll be on channel five.
- Okay.

1511
02:10:12,669 --> 02:10:14,671
We're on three.

1512
02:10:15,296 --> 02:10:16,297
Come back.

1513
02:10:17,215 --> 02:10:18,549
I always come back.

1514
02:10:19,676 --> 02:10:22,470
I'll have that chopper hot in ten.
Wait for my signal.

1515
02:10:24,597 --> 02:10:26,933
Evacuation phase four complete.

1516
02:10:27,016 --> 02:10:29,018
All living assets now in containment.

1517
02:10:38,027 --> 02:10:39,028
Come on.

1518
02:10:51,582 --> 02:10:53,042
Still get nightmares?

1519
02:10:53,626 --> 02:10:54,627
All the time.

1520
02:10:55,670 --> 02:10:56,671
You?

1521
02:10:58,047 --> 02:10:59,966
I have a lot of regrets.

1522
02:11:00,049 --> 02:11:01,050
Oh, yeah?

1523
02:11:02,552 --> 02:11:03,553
Well,

1524
02:11:04,470 --> 02:11:07,598
we hold on to regret,
we stay in the past.

1525
02:11:11,227 --> 02:11:12,854
What matters, I guess, is...

1526
02:11:14,564 --> 02:11:16,024
Is what we do now.

1527
02:11:16,649 --> 02:11:18,484
- Right?
- Yeah.

1528
02:11:24,615 --> 02:11:27,493
Ah.

1529
02:11:31,289 --> 02:11:32,582
Okay.

1530
02:11:35,918 --> 02:11:37,879
Nobody said there'd be bugs.

1531
02:11:40,131 --> 02:11:42,091
B4. She's in here.

1532
02:11:42,967 --> 02:11:46,637
Watch the sides.
They always come from the sides.

1533
02:11:48,806 --> 02:11:54,604
You know, at first we thought
they disembowel their prey, but no.

1534
02:11:55,813 --> 02:11:58,232
They're smart enough
to go straight for the throat.

1535
02:11:59,317 --> 02:12:00,777
The veins, the arteries.

1536
02:12:02,070 --> 02:12:04,197
Sometimes both at the same time.

1537
02:12:04,280 --> 02:12:05,406
Okay.

1538
02:12:07,158 --> 02:12:08,409
Okay.

1539
02:12:08,493 --> 02:12:10,411
We've got you.
It's right down that aisle.

1540
02:12:10,495 --> 02:12:13,295
It's right down that aisle where you are.

1541
02:12:13,331 --> 02:12:14,665
Why are they skulking in...

1542
02:12:14,749 --> 02:12:15,917
You can sprint right for it.

1543
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,419
Okay. Here it is.

1544
02:12:18,503 --> 02:12:20,588
Okay, it'll be a yellow button
on a grid of six.

1545
02:12:20,671 --> 02:12:23,466
There's a green button.
Do you see a green button?

1546
02:12:23,549 --> 02:12:25,301
It's not that green button.

1547
02:12:25,384 --> 02:12:27,428
It's four from the bottom.
Above this...

1548
02:12:27,512 --> 02:12:28,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Fourth one up?

1549
02:12:29,013 --> 02:12:30,733
Third one down or fourth one up.
Same thing.

1550
02:12:30,807 --> 02:12:32,058
Ian, be specific.

1551
02:12:37,313 --> 02:12:38,564
She was here.

1552
02:12:39,148 --> 02:12:40,316
Lights off.

1553
02:12:46,864 --> 02:12:48,950
I don't know how I could possibly
be more specific

1554
02:12:49,033 --> 02:12:51,786
other than to say
that the one you want is marked

1555
02:12:51,869 --> 02:12:53,538
- with "e1." E1.
- E1.

1556
02:12:57,416 --> 02:12:59,001
Yeah.

1557
02:13:03,548 --> 02:13:05,716
No. No, no, no, no.

1558
02:13:12,348 --> 02:13:14,308
Damn it. She's fast.

1559
02:13:19,063 --> 02:13:20,481
Eyes on me.

1560
02:13:24,986 --> 02:13:27,280
I've got to hit her
on the side of her neck.

1561
02:13:27,363 --> 02:13:28,990
Maisie,
you're gonna hold her focus.

1562
02:13:29,615 --> 02:13:30,616
Grant,

1563
02:13:31,284 --> 02:13:32,410
we're triangulating.

1564
02:14:08,779 --> 02:14:09,780
Sorry, girl.

1565
02:14:10,907 --> 02:14:12,867
I promised your mom
I'd get you home.

1566
02:14:14,202 --> 02:14:16,204
Primary system rebooting.

1567
02:14:16,287 --> 02:14:18,372
Wait. Oh, no, no, no.

1568
02:14:18,456 --> 02:14:19,790
- No, no, no.
- It's rebooting.

1569
02:14:19,874 --> 02:14:21,000
It shouldn't be doing that.

1570
02:14:32,887 --> 02:14:33,888
Here, take this.

1571
02:14:50,446 --> 02:14:51,924
- Gonna stay on it.
- Shut it down!

1572
02:14:51,948 --> 02:14:54,259
We're gonna make it work.
We're gonna figure this out. It's complex.

1573
02:14:54,283 --> 02:14:56,244
We don't have time for complex!

1574
02:15:01,540 --> 02:15:03,417
Primary system compromised.

1575
02:15:05,753 --> 02:15:07,171
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1576
02:15:07,255 --> 02:15:09,149
Aerial deterrent system active.

1577
02:15:09,173 --> 02:15:10,258
Victory. Victory.

1578
02:15:14,136 --> 02:15:15,596
Damn, that felt good.

1579
02:15:44,083 --> 02:15:45,584
Oh! Come on!

1580
02:16:38,346 --> 02:16:39,555
What's your story?

1581
02:16:43,100 --> 02:16:44,101
Wait!

1582
02:16:55,071 --> 02:16:57,531
At BIOS yn, we 're dedicated to the idea

1583
02:16:57,615 --> 02:17:01,577
that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves.

1584
02:17:06,290 --> 02:17:08,584
All right, Kayla. We 're good to go.

1585
02:17:19,136 --> 02:17:20,262
Okay, cutie.

1586
02:17:27,061 --> 02:17:28,062
Come here.

1587
02:17:29,522 --> 02:17:30,522
You all right?

1588
02:17:31,649 --> 02:17:32,817
Hey.

1589
02:17:40,866 --> 02:17:42,076
I remember you.

1590
02:17:42,701 --> 02:17:44,286
Please. You have to listen to me.

1591
02:17:44,370 --> 02:17:46,247
You created an ecological disaster.

1592
02:17:46,330 --> 02:17:47,748
And I can fix it.

1593
02:17:48,457 --> 02:17:51,669
Charlotte lockwood changed every cell
in maisie's body.

1594
02:17:52,753 --> 02:17:54,255
It saved her life.

1595
02:17:54,338 --> 02:17:57,800
If I can understand
how Charlotte rewrote maisie's DNA,

1596
02:17:57,883 --> 02:18:01,053
I can spread change from one locust
to the entire swarm.

1597
02:18:01,137 --> 02:18:02,972
Before it's too late.

1598
02:18:04,974 --> 02:18:05,975
It's okay.

1599
02:18:06,767 --> 02:18:07,768
It's okay.

1600
02:18:11,188 --> 02:18:13,023
It's what she would've wanted.

1601
02:18:16,026 --> 02:18:17,027
Thank you.

1602
02:18:17,111 --> 02:18:18,112
No, no, no.

1603
02:18:19,196 --> 02:18:20,990
No, no, no, no, no.

1604
02:18:21,866 --> 02:18:22,867
Him?

1605
02:18:23,367 --> 02:18:25,870
Not him. Not him.
It's always him.

1606
02:18:25,953 --> 02:18:26,954
Every si...

1607
02:18:28,539 --> 02:18:30,291
Is that a dinosaur
on your shoulder?

1608
02:18:31,292 --> 02:18:32,460
Yeah. Why?

1609
02:18:34,170 --> 02:18:36,213
Lhave air. Meet me at the center.

1610
02:18:36,297 --> 02:18:39,925
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, hey. Do not land in here.

1611
02:18:40,009 --> 02:18:42,052
I don't have a choice, dude.
The valley isn't safe.

1612
02:18:42,136 --> 02:18:43,721
No, they're not in the valley anymore!

1613
02:18:43,804 --> 02:18:45,890
Oh!

1614
02:20:16,146 --> 02:20:17,231
This isn't about us.

1615
02:20:22,236 --> 02:20:23,237
Go! Go!

1616
02:20:43,882 --> 02:20:44,883
Come on!

1617
02:20:48,679 --> 02:20:51,307
Oh, my god! Get him up!
Come on, come on!

1618
02:20:51,390 --> 02:20:53,392
Come on.

1619
02:20:55,561 --> 02:20:56,979
Come on, come on, come ol'i!

1620
02:21:01,567 --> 02:21:02,568
Come on!

1621
02:21:17,082 --> 02:21:18,082
Ellie, no!

1622
02:21:47,571 --> 02:21:48,989
Come on, maisie! Go!

1623
02:21:51,075 --> 02:21:52,368
Ramsay, get in.

1624
02:21:52,451 --> 02:21:54,203
Come on, come on, come on.

1625
02:21:58,707 --> 02:22:00,626
Everybody hold on to somebody.

1626
02:23:25,085 --> 02:23:26,754
No, at every level.

1627
02:23:26,837 --> 02:23:29,423
Complete systemic corruption
in the executive ranks.

1628
02:23:29,506 --> 02:23:32,509
"Systemic corruption." You get that?
Write that down.

1629
02:23:32,593 --> 02:23:34,887
Yeah, it's crazy.

1630
02:23:34,970 --> 02:23:38,223
And then... and then we crashed
into this ice lake, right?

1631
02:23:38,307 --> 02:23:40,309
I mean,
they literally owe me a plane.

1632
02:23:40,392 --> 02:23:43,187
I need to get this sample vetted
at the lab

1633
02:23:43,270 --> 02:23:45,397
before I take it to my contact
at the times.

1634
02:23:47,733 --> 02:23:49,943
You could, uh, come with me.

1635
02:23:51,612 --> 02:23:54,031
Unless you need
to get back to your dig.

1636
02:23:57,034 --> 02:23:58,535
- Ellie?
- Yeah?

1637
02:24:01,205 --> 02:24:02,915
I am coming with you.

1638
02:24:14,051 --> 02:24:17,429
I know. One more minute,
then we'll send you home with your folks.

1639
02:24:57,094 --> 02:24:59,179
Ueponefl
today marks the first day of testimony

1640
02:24:59,263 --> 02:25:01,515
from BIOS yn whistleblower ramsay Cole.

1641
02:25:01,598 --> 02:25:05,477
The senate will also hear from
doctors Grant, sattler and Malcolm,

1642
02:25:05,561 --> 02:25:09,231
who have been vocal in this debate
since the incident at Jurassic park.

1643
02:25:11,859 --> 02:25:13,068
You look...

1644
02:25:13,610 --> 02:25:15,153
- Uncomfortable.
- Trustworthy.

1645
02:25:20,450 --> 02:25:22,661
Yeah, not getting used to it.

1646
02:25:25,122 --> 02:25:26,123
Let's finish this.

1647
02:25:27,082 --> 02:25:28,083
Yeah.

1648
02:25:32,296 --> 02:25:35,048
Dr. Henry wu
has found an emergency solution

1649
02:25:35,132 --> 02:25:37,092
to the ecological crisis.

1650
02:25:37,175 --> 02:25:40,345
His use of a pathogen
to alter the locusts ' DNA

1651
02:25:40,429 --> 02:25:42,723
has revolutionized modern genetics.

1652
02:25:43,348 --> 02:25:47,352
He attr/buted the disco very
to another scientist, Charlotte lockwood,

1653
02:25:47,436 --> 02:25:49,938
who dr'ed nearly 73 years ago.

1654
02:26:17,424 --> 02:26:22,638
By UN decree, BIOS yn valley
has been designated a global sanctuary.

1655
02:26:22,721 --> 02:26:26,475
The animals will live there free,
safe from the outside world

1656
02:26:31,146 --> 02:26:32,940
- money?
- Money.

1657
02:26:33,023 --> 02:26:34,024
Thank you.

1658
02:28:37,773 --> 02:28:41,610
Life on earth has existed
for hundreds of millions of years.

1659
02:28:42,694 --> 02:28:45,405
And dinosaurs were only a part of that.

1660
02:28:45,489 --> 02:28:47,449
And we're an even smaller part of that.

1661
02:28:48,158 --> 02:28:50,327
They really put us in perspective.

1662
02:28:52,454 --> 02:28:55,832
The idea that life on earth
existed 65 m/llion years ago...

1663
02:28:57,501 --> 02:28:58,502
It's humbling.

1664
02:29:00,128 --> 02:29:02,547
We act like we're alone here,
but we're not.

1665
02:29:03,423 --> 02:29:06,343
We 're part of a fragile system
made up of all living things.

1666
02:29:07,636 --> 02:29:10,430
If we 're going to survive,
we '/I have to trust each other.

1667
02:29:11,556 --> 02:29:12,849
Depend on each other.

1668
02:29:13,809 --> 02:29:15,560
Coexist.
