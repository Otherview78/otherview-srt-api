1
00:02:38,548 --> 00:02:43,259
I'm gonna turn over the next card. I want you to concentrate.

2
00:02:43,427 --> 00:02:46,263
I want you to tell me what you think it is.

3
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,145
Square.

4
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,521
Good guess. But wrong.

5
00:03:05,074 --> 00:03:06,824
Clear your head.

6
00:03:08,912 --> 00:03:12,205
All right. Tell me what you think it is.

7
00:03:13,582 --> 00:03:15,167
Is it a star?

8
00:03:16,252 --> 00:03:20,004
It is a star. Very good. That's great.

9
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:22,925
Okay. All right.

10
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:27,094
Think hard. What is it?

11
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:29,764
Circle.

12
00:03:29,932 --> 00:03:33,852
Close. But definitely wrong.

13
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:37,647
Okay.

14
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,567
- All right. Ready? - Yeah.

15
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:43,110
All right.

16
00:03:44,781 --> 00:03:46,448
What is it?

17
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:50,159
Come on.

18
00:03:51,454 --> 00:03:53,288
Figure eight.

19
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,545
Incredible. That's 5 for 5. You can't see these, can you?

20
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:03,674
- You're not cheating me, are you? - No, I swear they're just coming to me.

21
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:05,967
Okay.

22
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:11,598
- Nervous? - Yes. I don't like this.

23
00:04:11,765 --> 00:04:17,019
You only have 75 more to go, okay? What's this one?

24
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:22,526
It's a couple of wavy lines.

25
00:04:22,694 --> 00:04:26,487
- Sorry. This isn't your lucky day. - I know.

26
00:04:29,242 --> 00:04:31,076
Wait...

27
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:36,540
I'm getting a little tired of this!

28
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:39,209
You volunteered, didn't you? We're paying, aren't we?

29
00:04:39,377 --> 00:04:42,629
Yeah, but I didn't know you were gonna give me electric shocks!

30
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:44,840
What are you trying to prove here, anyway?

31
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:48,968
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.

32
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:52,598
The effect? I'll tell you what the effect is. It's pissing me off!

33
00:04:52,764 --> 00:04:54,600
Well, then maybe my theory is correct!

34
00:04:54,766 --> 00:04:58,562
- You can keep the 5 bucks. I've had it. - I will, mister!

35
00:05:02,524 --> 00:05:05,235
You may as well get used to that.

36
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:10,156
It's the kind of resentment that your ability will provoke in some people.

37
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,576
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?

38
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:17,372
You're no fluke, Jennifer.

39
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,000
This is it. This is definitely it!

40
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:22,543
Did those UV lenses come in for the video camera?

41
00:05:22,711 --> 00:05:26,255
And that blank tape, I need it, the one you erased yesterday.

42
00:05:26,423 --> 00:05:29,550
- Will you excuse me for a second? - Sure.

43
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:34,221
I'm right in the middle of something, Ray.

44
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:36,057
I need more time with this subject.

45
00:05:36,225 --> 00:05:38,726
Could you come back in an hour, hour and a half?

46
00:05:38,894 --> 00:05:40,896
Peter, at 1:40 p. M...

47
00:05:41,064 --> 00:05:44,483
...at the main branch of The New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue...

48
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:49,362
...10 people witnessed a free-floating, full-torso, vaporous apparition.

49
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,697
It blew books off shelves from 20 feet away...

50
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:54,242
...and scared the socks off some poor librarian.

51
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:56,620
I'm very excited. I'm very pleased.

52
00:05:56,788 --> 00:06:00,706
I want you to get right down there, check it out, and get back to me.

53
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,709
You're coming with us on this one. Spengler went down there.

54
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:06,922
He took PKE valences, went right off the top of the scale.

55
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:11,425
Buried the needle. We're close on this one. I can feel it.

56
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,016
I can feel it. We're very, very close.

57
00:06:19,976 --> 00:06:23,230
I have to go now, Jennifer, but I'd like to work with you some more.

58
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:25,564
Perhaps you could come back this evening at...?

59
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,108
Eight o'clock?

60
00:06:27,276 --> 00:06:32,154
I was just going to say, "8:00?" You are a legitimate phenomenon.

61
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:36,534
As a friend, I must say...

62
00:06:36,702 --> 00:06:39,663
...you've finally gone around the bend on this ghost business.

63
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:42,832
You guys have been meeting every schizo in the five boroughs...

64
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,002
...who says he has a paranormal experience. What have you seen?

65
00:06:46,545 --> 00:06:51,507
You forget, I was there at an undersea, unexplained mass sponge migration.

66
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:56,555
Oh, Ray, the sponges migrated about a foot and a half.

67
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,478
- You're here. - Yeah, what have you got?

68
00:07:04,646 --> 00:07:07,858
This is big, this is very big. There's definitely something here.

69
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:11,778
Egon, this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole through your head.

70
00:07:11,946 --> 00:07:13,988
- Remember that? - That would've worked if...

71
00:07:14,156 --> 00:07:17,074
I'm Roger Delacorte. Are you the men from the university?

72
00:07:17,242 --> 00:07:20,829
Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman. Dr. Stantz. Egon.

73
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:25,000
Thank you for coming. I hope we can clear this up quickly and quietly.

74
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:29,504
Let's not rush things. We don't even know what you have yet.

75
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:32,007
I don't remember seeing any legs...

76
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:35,343
...but it definitely had arms, because it reached out for me.

77
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:37,637
Arms? I can't wait to get a look at this.

78
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:40,598
Alice, I'll ask you a couple of standard questions, okay?

79
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,100
Have you or any member of your family...

80
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:47,355
...ever been diagnosed schizophrenic, mentally incompetent?

81
00:07:48,191 --> 00:07:51,276
My uncle thought he was St. Jerome.

82
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:55,237
I'd call that a big yes.

83
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:59,701
Are you habitually using drugs, stimulants, alcohol?

84
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:03,163
- No. - No, no. Just asking.

85
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:06,833
Are you, Alice, menstruating right now?

86
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,172
- What has that got to do with it? - Back off, man. I'm a scientist.

87
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:15,466
Ray, it's moving. Come on.

88
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:41,951
Look!

89
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:51,418
- This is hot, Ray. - Symmetrical book-stacking.

90
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:55,506
Just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947.

91
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:59,927
You're right. No human being would stack books like this.

92
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:04,014
Listen! Do you smell something?

93
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:15,610
Talk about telekinetic activity. Look at this mess.

94
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:18,822
Raymond, look at this.

95
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:21,533
Ectoplasmic residue.

96
00:09:21,701 --> 00:09:25,787
- Venkman, get a sample of this. - It's the real thing.

97
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:28,289
Somebody blows their nose, and you wanna keep it?

98
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:30,125
I'd like to analyze it.

99
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:34,254
- There's more over here. - I'm getting stronger readings here.

100
00:09:40,302 --> 00:09:42,095
This way.

101
00:09:43,972 --> 00:09:45,599
Come on.

102
00:09:55,484 --> 00:09:57,818
Egon, your mucus.

103
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:07,162
This happen to you before?

104
00:10:09,081 --> 00:10:10,664
First time?

105
00:10:36,024 --> 00:10:37,775
It's here.

106
00:10:38,693 --> 00:10:42,905
A full torso apparition. And it's real.

107
00:10:47,662 --> 00:10:49,578
So, what do we do?

108
00:10:54,376 --> 00:10:57,504
Could you come over here and talk to me for a second, please?

109
00:10:57,672 --> 00:10:59,838
Could you just come here for a second, please?

110
00:11:00,006 --> 00:11:03,467
Right over here. Come here, Francine. Come here.

111
00:11:04,052 --> 00:11:07,138
- What do we do? - I don't know. What do you think?

112
00:11:07,306 --> 00:11:09,099
Stop that!

113
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:12,559
We've gotta make contact. One of us should try to speak to it.

114
00:11:12,727 --> 00:11:14,187
Good idea.

115
00:11:22,904 --> 00:11:24,405
Hello.

116
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:26,615
I'm Peter.

117
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:30,745
Where are you from? Originally.

118
00:11:35,418 --> 00:11:38,628
All right. Okay. The usual stuff isn't working.

119
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:43,133
Okay, I have a plan. I know exactly what to do.

120
00:11:45,094 --> 00:11:47,220
Now, stay close.

121
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:49,596
Stay close.

122
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:52,767
I know. Do exactly as I say.

123
00:11:52,934 --> 00:11:55,186
Get ready. Ready?

124
00:11:55,354 --> 00:11:56,855
Get her!

125
00:12:05,364 --> 00:12:08,450
- Did you see it? What was it? - We'll get back to you.

126
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:09,951
Wait!

127
00:12:18,878 --> 00:12:23,338
"Get her." That was your whole plan. Get her.

128
00:12:24,383 --> 00:12:28,302
- It was scientific. - I just got overexcited.

129
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:32,474
But wasn't it incredible, Pete? We actually touched the etheric plane.

130
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,725
You know what this could mean to the school?

131
00:12:34,894 --> 00:12:37,227
Yeah, it's gonna be bigger than the microchip.

132
00:12:37,395 --> 00:12:39,105
The experience wasn't wasted.

133
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:42,107
According to these readings, we have an excellent chance...

134
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:43,942
...of catching and holding a ghost.

135
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,114
This is great. If the ionization rate is constant for all ectoplasmic entities...

136
00:12:48,282 --> 00:12:51,493
...we could really bust some heads. In a spiritual sense, of course.

137
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:54,662
Spengs, you serious about this catching a ghost?

138
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,748
I'm always serious.

139
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:00,960
Egon, I'm gonna take back some of the things I've said about you.

140
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:05,590
You've earned it.

141
00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:11,804
The possibilities are limitless. Hey, Dean Yeager.

142
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,936
I trust you're moving us to better quarters on campus.

143
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:20,187
No, you're being moved off campus.

144
00:13:20,355 --> 00:13:23,024
The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.

145
00:13:23,192 --> 00:13:26,027
You are to vacate these premises immediately.

146
00:13:26,195 --> 00:13:29,197
This is preposterous. I demand an explanation.

147
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:32,366
Fine. This university will no longer continue...

148
00:13:32,534 --> 00:13:35,870
...any funding of any kind for your group's activities.

149
00:13:36,038 --> 00:13:37,705
But the kids love us.

150
00:13:37,873 --> 00:13:44,003
Dr. Venkman, we believe the purpose of science is to serve mankind.

151
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:48,716
You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of dodge or hustle.

152
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:51,302
Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe.

153
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,806
Your methods are sloppy, and your conclusions are highly questionable.

154
00:13:54,974 --> 00:13:58,433
You are a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman.

155
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,062
I see.

156
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:06,067
And you have no place in this department or in this university.

157
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:09,486
This is a major disgrace. Forget MIT or Stanford now.

158
00:14:09,654 --> 00:14:12,072
They wouldn't touch us with a 10-meter cattle prod.

159
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,576
You're always so concerned about your reputation.

160
00:14:14,743 --> 00:14:17,578
Einstein did his best stuff when he was a patent clerk.

161
00:14:17,745 --> 00:14:19,581
You know how much a patent clerk earns?

162
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:23,418
The university gave us money. We didn't have to produce anything.

163
00:14:23,586 --> 00:14:26,671
You've never been out of college. You don't know what it's like.

164
00:14:26,838 --> 00:14:30,258
I've worked in the private sector. They expect results.

165
00:14:30,426 --> 00:14:32,259
For whatever reasons, Ray...

166
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:37,514
...call it fate, call it luck, call it karma...

167
00:14:37,682 --> 00:14:40,518
...I believe that everything happens for a reason.

168
00:14:40,686 --> 00:14:44,772
I believe that we were destined to get thrown out of this dump.

169
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:49,943
- For what purpose? - To go into business for ourselves.

170
00:14:53,908 --> 00:14:56,743
This ecto-containment system Spengler and I have in mind...

171
00:14:56,911 --> 00:15:00,455
...will require a load of capital. Where will we get the money?

172
00:15:02,124 --> 00:15:05,793
I don't know. I don't know.

173
00:15:07,796 --> 00:15:10,048
You're never gonna regret this, Ray.

174
00:15:10,216 --> 00:15:12,799
My parents left me that house. I was born there.

175
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:16,221
You won't lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages nowadays.

176
00:15:16,388 --> 00:15:19,057
But at 19 percent? You didn't even bargain with the guy.

177
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:21,725
Ray, for your information, the interest rate alone...

178
00:15:21,894 --> 00:15:24,645
...for the first five years comes to 95,000 dollars.

179
00:15:24,812 --> 00:15:27,815
Will you guys relax? We are on the threshold of establishing...

180
00:15:28,024 --> 00:15:31,068
...the indispensable defense science of the next decade:

181
00:15:31,236 --> 00:15:34,822
Professional paranormal investigations and eliminations.

182
00:15:35,032 --> 00:15:39,661
The franchise rights alone will make us rich beyond our wildest dreams.

183
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:42,996
There's office space, sleeping quarters and showers...

184
00:15:43,164 --> 00:15:44,749
...and there's a full kitchen.

185
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:49,836
It just seems a little pricey for a unique fixer-upper opportunity, that's all.

186
00:15:50,047 --> 00:15:51,838
What do you think, Egon?

187
00:15:52,048 --> 00:15:54,259
I think this building should be condemned.

188
00:15:54,426 --> 00:15:56,970
There's metal fatigue in all the load-bearing members.

189
00:15:57,136 --> 00:16:00,764
The wiring is substandard. It's inadequate for our power needs.

190
00:16:00,932 --> 00:16:03,850
And the neighborhood is like a demilitarized zone.

191
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,937
Hey, does this pole still work?

192
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:14,028
Wow, this place is great. When can we move in?

193
00:16:14,196 --> 00:16:18,198
You gotta try this pole. I'm gonna get my stuff.

194
00:16:21,577 --> 00:16:26,581
Hey, we should stay here tonight, sleep here. You know, to try it out.

195
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:38,552
- I think we'll take it. - Good.

196
00:17:13,338 --> 00:17:14,672
Hi.

197
00:17:20,261 --> 00:17:22,680
- Dana, it's you. - Hi. Yes, Louis, it's me.

198
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:25,223
- I thought it was the drugstore. - Are you sick?

199
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:27,101
No, I'm fine. I feel great.

200
00:17:27,269 --> 00:17:30,438
Just ordered some more vitamins and stuff. I was just exercising.

201
00:17:30,605 --> 00:17:33,273
I taped 20-Minute Workout and played it at high speed...

202
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:35,609
...so it took 10 minutes. Got a great workout.

203
00:17:35,778 --> 00:17:37,528
Want to come in for a mineral water?

204
00:17:37,695 --> 00:17:40,948
I'd really like to, Louis, but I have a rehearsal. Excuse me.

205
00:17:41,157 --> 00:17:43,284
No sweat. I'll take a rain check on that.

206
00:17:43,451 --> 00:17:46,913
I have plenty of low-sodium mineral water and other nutritious foods.

207
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,955
- But you already know that. - I know that.

208
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:52,210
That reminds me, I'm having a big party for all my clients.

209
00:17:52,377 --> 00:17:54,211
My fourth anniversary as an accountant.

210
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,297
Even though you do your own tax return...

211
00:17:56,464 --> 00:17:58,257
...stop by, since you're my neighbor.

212
00:17:58,424 --> 00:18:00,550
Thank you, Louis. I'll really try to stop by.

213
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:03,887
You shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.

214
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:06,057
The creep down the hall phoned the manager.

215
00:18:06,224 --> 00:18:08,393
That's strange. I didn't realize I left it on.

216
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,395
I climbed on the ledge and tried to disconnect the cable...

217
00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:14,981
...but I couldn't get in, so I turned up my TV real loud too...

218
00:18:15,192 --> 00:18:18,486
...so everyone would think both our TVs had something wrong with them.

219
00:18:18,694 --> 00:18:22,240
Okay, so I'll see you later, huh? I'll give you a call.

220
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,492
I gotta have a shower.

221
00:18:29,498 --> 00:18:32,666
Are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night?

222
00:18:32,835 --> 00:18:36,002
Do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic?

223
00:18:36,171 --> 00:18:39,423
Have you or any of your family ever seen a spook, specter or ghost?

224
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:43,176
If the answer is yes, pick up your phone and call the professionals.

225
00:18:43,345 --> 00:18:44,846
Ghostbusters.

226
00:18:45,012 --> 00:18:47,347
Our courteous staff is on call 24 hours a day...

227
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:49,808
...to serve your supernatural-elimination needs.

228
00:18:49,977 --> 00:18:53,145
We're ready to believe you.

229
00:20:04,675 --> 00:20:06,426
Zuul.

230
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:12,432
You don't think it's too subtle?

231
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:16,229
You don't think people are gonna drive down and not see the sign?

232
00:20:24,238 --> 00:20:26,696
You can't park that here!

233
00:20:30,786 --> 00:20:32,953
Everybody can relax, I found the car.

234
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:35,580
Needs some suspension work and shocks...

235
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:39,794
...and brakes, brake pads, linings, steering box, transmission, rear end.

236
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:41,461
- How much? - Only 4800.

237
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,298
Maybe new rings, also mufflers, a little wiring.

238
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:50,971
- Janine, any calls? - No.

239
00:20:51,138 --> 00:20:53,641
- Any messages? - No.

240
00:20:54,643 --> 00:20:57,979
- Any customers? - No, Dr. Venkman.

241
00:20:59,439 --> 00:21:01,398
It's a good job, isn't it?

242
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:04,986
Type something, will you? We're paying for this stuff.

243
00:21:05,153 --> 00:21:08,489
Don't stare at me. You've got the bug eyes.

244
00:21:09,156 --> 00:21:10,825
Janine?

245
00:21:10,992 --> 00:21:14,119
Sorry about the "bug eyes" thing. I'll be in my office.

246
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,125
You're very handy. I can tell.

247
00:21:21,711 --> 00:21:26,007
- I bet you like to read a lot too. - Print is dead.

248
00:21:26,424 --> 00:21:30,010
Oh, that's very fascinating to me. I read a lot myself.

249
00:21:30,178 --> 00:21:34,848
Some people think I'm too intellectual, but it's a fabulous way to spend time.

250
00:21:35,017 --> 00:21:39,144
I also play racquetball. Do you have any hobbies?

251
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,231
I collect spores, molds and fungus.

252
00:21:48,195 --> 00:21:49,529
Hello?

253
00:22:07,548 --> 00:22:10,759
Excuse me. Is this...? This is the Ghostbusters' office.

254
00:22:10,969 --> 00:22:13,887
Yes, it is. Can I help you?

255
00:22:14,056 --> 00:22:17,974
I don't have an appointment. I'd like to talk to someone, please.

256
00:22:19,603 --> 00:22:23,271
I'm Peter Venkman. May I help you?

257
00:22:23,481 --> 00:22:28,778
Well, I don't know. What I have to say may sound a little unusual.

258
00:22:28,987 --> 00:22:31,780
That's all we get, day in, day out, around this place.

259
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,451
- Come into my office, Miss... - Barrett. Dana Barrett.

260
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:39,913
And this voice said, "Zuul," and then I slammed the refrigerator door and left.

261
00:22:40,082 --> 00:22:43,125
That was two days ago, and I haven't been back to my apartment.

262
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:46,461
Generally, you don't see that behavior in a major appliance.

263
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,962
What do you think it was?

264
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:50,590
Well, if I knew what it was, I wouldn't be here.

265
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,300
Egon, what do you think?

266
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,596
She's telling the truth. At least she thinks she is.

267
00:22:55,931 --> 00:23:00,267
Well, of course I'm telling the truth. Who would make up a story like that?

268
00:23:00,434 --> 00:23:02,310
Some are people who just want attention.

269
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,605
Others are nutballs who come off the street.

270
00:23:04,772 --> 00:23:09,151
You know what it could be? Past life experience intruding on present time.

271
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:11,945
Could be a memory stored in the collective unconscious.

272
00:23:12,114 --> 00:23:15,156
I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.

273
00:23:15,325 --> 00:23:17,910
I'm sorry, I don't believe in any of those things.

274
00:23:18,077 --> 00:23:22,288
Well, that's all right. I don't either. But there are some things we do...

275
00:23:22,457 --> 00:23:26,000
...standard procedures in a case like this, which often bring us results.

276
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:29,255
I could check out the structural details in the building.

277
00:23:29,423 --> 00:23:32,007
Maybe the building has a history of psychic turbulence.

278
00:23:32,174 --> 00:23:33,509
Right. Good idea.

279
00:23:33,676 --> 00:23:35,845
I could search "Zuul" in the usual literature.

280
00:23:36,054 --> 00:23:38,513
- Spates Catalog. - Tobin's Spirit Guide.

281
00:23:38,682 --> 00:23:42,643
I'll take Miss Barrett back to her apartment and check her out.

282
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:46,814
I'll go check out Miss Barrett's apartment. Okay?

283
00:23:47,356 --> 00:23:49,191
Okay.

284
00:23:49,984 --> 00:23:52,819
- Thank you. - It's okay.

285
00:24:00,578 --> 00:24:01,996
Please, let me.

286
00:24:02,163 --> 00:24:06,375
If something's gonna happen here, I want it to happen to me first.

287
00:24:10,672 --> 00:24:12,714
That's the closet.

288
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:21,515
They hate this.

289
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:24,018
I like to torture them.

290
00:24:24,185 --> 00:24:28,021
That's right, boys. It's Dr. Venkman!

291
00:24:33,653 --> 00:24:35,695
It's a lot of space.

292
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,741
- Just you? - Yes.

293
00:24:40,326 --> 00:24:41,701
Good.

294
00:24:45,874 --> 00:24:48,250
What is that thing you're doing?

295
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:52,212
It's technical. It's one of our little toys.

296
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,923
I see.

297
00:24:56,134 --> 00:25:00,054
That's the bedroom. But nothing ever happened in there.

298
00:25:03,016 --> 00:25:05,142
What a crime.

299
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:10,064
You know, you don't act like a scientist.

300
00:25:10,231 --> 00:25:15,068
- They're usually pretty stiff. - You're more like a game-show host.

301
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,661
That's the kitchen, huh?

302
00:25:35,965 --> 00:25:38,049
- Dana, are these the eggs? - Yes.

303
00:25:38,218 --> 00:25:41,386
I was over there, and these eggs jumped out of their shells...

304
00:25:41,555 --> 00:25:44,138
...and started to cook on the counter. - That is weird.

305
00:25:44,307 --> 00:25:48,434
That's when I started to hear that awful noise coming from the refrigerator.

306
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:53,941
You've come all this way. Would you like to check the refrigerator?

307
00:25:55,402 --> 00:25:58,778
Better check the fridge. Good call.

308
00:26:03,826 --> 00:26:06,202
Oh, my God.

309
00:26:06,704 --> 00:26:09,248
Look at all the junk food.

310
00:26:09,415 --> 00:26:12,292
- No. Goddamn it! This wasn't... - You actually eat this stuff?

311
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,336
This wasn't here. There was nothing here.

312
00:26:14,503 --> 00:26:18,132
There was a space and a building with flames coming out of it.

313
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:22,010
There were creatures writhing around, and they were growling and snarling.

314
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,971
And there were flames, and I heard a voice say, "Zuul."

315
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,472
It was right here.

316
00:26:26,641 --> 00:26:28,474
I'm sorry, I'm not getting any reading.

317
00:26:28,643 --> 00:26:31,686
Well, are you sure you're using that thing correctly?

318
00:26:31,855 --> 00:26:35,857
I think so. But I'm sure there are no animals in there.

319
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:37,358
Well, that's great.

320
00:26:37,527 --> 00:26:41,113
Either I have a monster in my kitchen, or I'm completely crazy.

321
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,615
I don't think you're crazy.

322
00:26:44,116 --> 00:26:49,329
Oh, good. That makes me feel so much better.

323
00:26:49,497 --> 00:26:51,164
Let me tell you something about me.

324
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:54,460
I come home from work to my place, and all I have is my work.

325
00:26:54,627 --> 00:26:56,170
There's nothing else in my life.

326
00:26:56,337 --> 00:27:00,633
I meet you and say, "There's someone with the same problem I have."

327
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,635
Yes, we both have the same problem. You.

328
00:27:07,348 --> 00:27:09,516
I'm gonna go for broke.

329
00:27:12,186 --> 00:27:15,064
- I am madly in love with you. - I don't believe this.

330
00:27:15,272 --> 00:27:17,816
Will you please leave?

331
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:21,362
And then she threw me out of her life. She thought I was a creep.

332
00:27:21,528 --> 00:27:24,530
She thought I was a geek, and she probably wasn't the first.

333
00:27:24,699 --> 00:27:26,991
You are so odd.

334
00:27:30,913 --> 00:27:33,374
- No. - I've got it!

335
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,335
- No. - I'll prove myself to you.

336
00:27:36,502 --> 00:27:38,252
That's not necessary.

337
00:27:38,421 --> 00:27:41,214
- Yeah, I'll solve your little problem. - Okay.

338
00:27:41,383 --> 00:27:45,051
And then you'll say, "Pete Venkman's a guy who can get things done.

339
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,221
- I wonder what makes him tick." - I wonder.

340
00:27:47,388 --> 00:27:50,391
"I wonder if he'd be interested in knowing what makes me tick."

341
00:27:50,557 --> 00:27:53,352
I'll bet you're gonna be thinking about me after I'm gone.

342
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,936
I bet I am.

343
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:58,106
No kiss?

344
00:28:08,117 --> 00:28:10,076
To our first customer.

345
00:28:10,244 --> 00:28:13,372
To our first and only customer.

346
00:28:14,624 --> 00:28:16,290
I'll need to draw some petty cash.

347
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:19,294
I should take her out to dinner. We don't want to lose her.

348
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:24,590
This magnificent feast here represents the last of the petty cash.

349
00:28:26,301 --> 00:28:28,929
Hey, slow down. Chew your food.

350
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:32,516
Hello, Ghostbusters.

351
00:28:33,101 --> 00:28:35,978
Yes, of course they're serious.

352
00:28:37,939 --> 00:28:39,480
You do?

353
00:28:40,107 --> 00:28:42,026
You have?

354
00:28:42,192 --> 00:28:43,943
No kidding.

355
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:47,990
Well, just give me the address.

356
00:28:48,615 --> 00:28:52,911
Yes, of course. Oh, they'll be totally discreet.

357
00:28:53,788 --> 00:28:55,705
Thank you.

358
00:28:56,124 --> 00:28:58,125
We got one!

359
00:29:03,006 --> 00:29:04,714
It's a call!

360
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,848
Come on!

361
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:50,760
Hey, anybody see a ghost?

362
00:29:55,682 --> 00:29:58,059
- Thank you for coming so quickly. - Jesus!

363
00:29:58,228 --> 00:30:01,270
The guests are asking questions, and I'm running out of excuses.

364
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,772
Has it happened before?

365
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:05,526
Most of the original staff knows about the 12th floor.

366
00:30:05,692 --> 00:30:07,193
- The disturbances, I mean. - Yeah.

367
00:30:07,362 --> 00:30:10,279
But it's been quiet for years up until two weeks ago.

368
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,240
It was never, ever this bad, though.

369
00:30:12,407 --> 00:30:16,452
- Did you ever report it to anyone? - No. Heavens, no.

370
00:30:16,621 --> 00:30:19,248
The owners don't like us to even talk about it.

371
00:30:19,414 --> 00:30:21,415
I hope we could take care of this quietly.

372
00:30:21,584 --> 00:30:22,917
- It's done. - Tonight.

373
00:30:23,086 --> 00:30:24,627
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

374
00:30:24,796 --> 00:30:27,381
We handle this kind of thing all the time.

375
00:30:35,557 --> 00:30:38,892
What are you supposed to be, some kind of a cosmonaut?

376
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:42,938
No, we're exterminators. Somebody saw a cockroach up on 12th.

377
00:30:43,105 --> 00:30:47,526
- That's gotta be some cockroach. - Bite your head off, man.

378
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:54,825
- Going up? - I'll take the next one.

379
00:30:57,412 --> 00:31:01,289
It just occurred to me we haven't had a successful test of this equipment.

380
00:31:01,457 --> 00:31:03,666
- I blame myself. - So do I.

381
00:31:03,835 --> 00:31:06,836
- Well, no sense worrying about it now. - Why worry?

382
00:31:07,046 --> 00:31:11,592
Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back.

383
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,180
Yep. Well, let's get ready. Switch me on.

384
00:31:52,217 --> 00:31:54,884
What the hell are you doing?

385
00:31:56,346 --> 00:31:58,555
- Sorry. - I'm sorry.

386
00:31:58,722 --> 00:32:00,807
We thought you were someone else.

387
00:32:03,144 --> 00:32:05,103
Successful test.

388
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,230
I guess so.

389
00:32:07,731 --> 00:32:09,857
- I think we'd better split up. - Good idea.

390
00:32:10,026 --> 00:32:11,984
Yeah, we can do more damage that way.

391
00:32:40,265 --> 00:32:42,766
Venkman? Venkman!

392
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:52,858
Disgusting blob.

393
00:32:53,653 --> 00:32:55,945
I'm gonna have to hold him myself.

394
00:33:37,488 --> 00:33:39,280
Come in, Ray.

395
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,826
Venkman! I saw it! I saw it!

396
00:33:44,202 --> 00:33:45,996
It's right here, Ray.

397
00:33:46,204 --> 00:33:47,748
It's looking at me.

398
00:33:47,914 --> 00:33:49,833
He's an ugly little spud, isn't he?

399
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,500
I think he can hear you, Ray.

400
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:53,586
Don't move. It won't hurt you.

401
00:34:01,304 --> 00:34:03,137
Venkman!

402
00:34:04,973 --> 00:34:07,601
Venkman! Pete!

403
00:34:10,228 --> 00:34:12,271
Venkman, what happened? Are you okay?

404
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,856
He slimed me.

405
00:34:14,025 --> 00:34:17,443
That's great! Actual physical contact!

406
00:34:17,612 --> 00:34:19,780
- Can you move? - Ray. Ray! Come in, please!

407
00:34:19,947 --> 00:34:21,280
I feel so funky.

408
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:23,949
Spengler! I'm with Venkman.

409
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,619
He got slimed!

410
00:34:25,786 --> 00:34:27,704
That's great, Ray. Save some for me.

411
00:34:27,871 --> 00:34:30,539
Get down here, right away! It just went into a ballroom.

412
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,041
Okay, we'll be right there.

413
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:37,630
If you and your staff could please wait out here...

414
00:34:37,798 --> 00:34:40,132
...we'll take care of everything.

415
00:34:58,568 --> 00:35:01,070
There it is. On the ceiling.

416
00:35:03,407 --> 00:35:05,826
That's the one that got me.

417
00:35:13,418 --> 00:35:14,751
All right, boys.

418
00:35:14,918 --> 00:35:16,670
Ready?

419
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:18,170
Throw it!

420
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:29,181
I did that. I did that.

421
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:32,018
- That's my fault. - It's okay. The table broke the fall.

422
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:35,021
There's something very important I forgot to tell you.

423
00:35:35,188 --> 00:35:37,523
- What? - Don't cross the streams.

424
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,318
- Why? - It would be bad.

425
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:44,072
I'm fuzzy on the whole good/bad thing. What do you mean, "bad"?

426
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,034
Lmagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule...

427
00:35:48,202 --> 00:35:50,454
...in your body exploding at the speed of light.

428
00:35:51,204 --> 00:35:52,873
Total protonic reversal.

429
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:56,960
Right, that's bad. Okay, important safety tip. Thanks, Egon.

430
00:35:57,128 --> 00:36:01,547
All right, Ray, take the left. Egon, take the right.

431
00:36:08,097 --> 00:36:10,724
Okay, Ray, just give me one high and outside.

432
00:36:10,891 --> 00:36:12,641
Ray!

433
00:36:15,353 --> 00:36:16,771
Egon!

434
00:36:24,572 --> 00:36:26,572
Okay, all right. Hold it, hold it, hold it!

435
00:36:30,077 --> 00:36:31,619
Nice shooting, Tex!

436
00:36:31,786 --> 00:36:34,079
I assure you, there is no problem with the room.

437
00:36:34,248 --> 00:36:36,583
It'll be ready as soon as your guests are here.

438
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:38,835
It took something out of him, but he'll move.

439
00:36:39,003 --> 00:36:41,922
I need some room to put the trap down. Give me some room.

440
00:36:42,757 --> 00:36:45,007
You'll excuse me, please.

441
00:36:51,474 --> 00:36:54,476
- Gotta get this in the clear. - Wait, wait, wait!

442
00:36:54,643 --> 00:36:57,269
I've always wanted to do this.

443
00:36:57,438 --> 00:36:58,980
And...

444
00:36:59,148 --> 00:37:02,025
- The flowers are still standing! - Okay, on my go-signal.

445
00:37:02,193 --> 00:37:05,445
Spengler, I want a confinement stream from you, okay? Go!

446
00:37:05,612 --> 00:37:08,364
Okay, hold him up there. He's gonna move. Hold him up!

447
00:37:08,532 --> 00:37:09,949
Go!

448
00:37:11,786 --> 00:37:13,619
- It's working. - Start bringing him down.

449
00:37:13,788 --> 00:37:15,539
You got him. Don't cross the stream.

450
00:37:15,706 --> 00:37:19,876
Maybe now you'll never slime a guy with a positron collider, huh?

451
00:37:20,043 --> 00:37:23,420
Venkman, shorten your stream. I don't want my face burned off.

452
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,632
I'm opening the trap now. Don't look directly into the trap.

453
00:37:27,717 --> 00:37:29,385
I looked at the trap, Ray.

454
00:37:29,554 --> 00:37:33,974
Turn your streams off when I close the trap. Get ready. I'm closing it.

455
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:36,059
Now!

456
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:55,954
It's in there.

457
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:01,458
Well, that wasn't such a chore, now, was it?

458
00:38:04,213 --> 00:38:06,505
Mr. Smith, quickly. I want that door open now!

459
00:38:06,673 --> 00:38:08,465
Donald, stand over there.

460
00:38:09,092 --> 00:38:11,844
We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!

461
00:38:12,012 --> 00:38:13,429
Did you see it? What is it?

462
00:38:13,597 --> 00:38:14,931
We got it.

463
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:17,099
What is it? Will there be any more of them?

464
00:38:17,268 --> 00:38:20,186
What you had there was what we refer to as a focused...

465
00:38:20,353 --> 00:38:24,106
...non-terminal repeating phantasm, or a class-five full-roaming vapor.

466
00:38:24,275 --> 00:38:25,983
Real nasty one too.

467
00:38:26,152 --> 00:38:27,985
And now...

468
00:38:28,153 --> 00:38:29,487
...let's talk seriously.

469
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:34,034
For the entrapment, we're gonna have to ask you for four big ones, $4000.

470
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:37,369
But we are having a special this week on proton charging...

471
00:38:37,538 --> 00:38:38,871
...and storage of the beast.

472
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:41,541
That's only gonna come to 1000 dollars, fortunately.

473
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:45,295
Five thousand dollars? I had no idea it'd be so much. I won't pay it.

474
00:38:45,463 --> 00:38:47,630
That's all right. We can just put it back.

475
00:38:47,797 --> 00:38:49,673
We certainly can, Dr. Venkman.

476
00:38:49,842 --> 00:38:53,385
No! All right! Anything.

477
00:38:53,554 --> 00:38:54,887
Thanks so much.

478
00:38:55,056 --> 00:38:56,847
Thank you. Hope we can help you again.

479
00:38:57,057 --> 00:38:59,851
Coming through! One class-five free-roaming vapor.

480
00:39:00,061 --> 00:39:03,146
Morning, I'm Roger Grimsby. Today, the entire Eastern seaboard...

481
00:39:03,313 --> 00:39:06,358
...is alive with talk of incidents of paranormal activity.

482
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:09,443
Alleged ghost-sightings and supernatural occurrences...

483
00:39:09,612 --> 00:39:12,237
...have been reported across the entire tri-state area.

484
00:39:12,405 --> 00:39:14,949
Everybody has heard ghost stories around the campfire.

485
00:39:15,117 --> 00:39:18,286
My grandma used to spin yarns about a spectral locomotive...

486
00:39:18,454 --> 00:39:20,954
...that would rocket past the farm where she grew up.

487
00:39:21,123 --> 00:39:23,208
But now, as if some unforeseen authority...

488
00:39:43,603 --> 00:39:44,938
Stand aside, please!

489
00:39:45,106 --> 00:39:48,358
Hi, this is Larry King. The phone-in topic, ghosts and ghostbusting.

490
00:39:48,525 --> 00:39:51,068
The controversy builds, more sightings are reported.

491
00:39:51,237 --> 00:39:52,737
Some maintain that these...

492
00:39:52,905 --> 00:39:56,615
...professional paranormal eliminators in New York are the cause of it all.

493
00:40:02,123 --> 00:40:03,414
I got it! I got it!

494
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:06,418
Pete! Ray!

495
00:40:15,344 --> 00:40:17,637
Still making headlines all across the country...

496
00:40:17,804 --> 00:40:21,432
...the Ghostbusters are at it again, this time at the dance club...

497
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:25,394
...The Rose. The boys in gray slugged it out with a pesky poltergeist...

498
00:40:25,563 --> 00:40:29,440
...then stayed to dance with the ladies who witnessed the disturbance.

499
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,652
This is Casey Kasem. Now on with the countdown.

500
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,945
Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.

501
00:40:35,155 --> 00:40:37,824
No job is too big. No fee is too big.

502
00:40:39,284 --> 00:40:41,786
Is it just a mist, or does it have arms and legs?

503
00:40:41,954 --> 00:40:44,581
As they say in TV, I'm sure there's one big question...

504
00:40:44,748 --> 00:40:47,958
...on everybody's mind and I imagine you are the man to answer that.

505
00:40:48,168 --> 00:40:51,295
How is Elvis, and have you seen him lately?

506
00:41:35,632 --> 00:41:37,842
Do you believe in UFOs, astral projections...

507
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:40,469
...mental telepathy, ESP, clairvoyance...

508
00:41:40,637 --> 00:41:43,681
...spirit photography, telekinetic movement...

509
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:48,728
...full-trance mediums, the Loch Ness monster and the theory of Atlantis?

510
00:41:48,896 --> 00:41:53,023
If there's a steady paycheck in it, I'll believe anything you say.

511
00:41:54,235 --> 00:41:57,195
I gotta get some sleep. I'm dying.

512
00:41:57,362 --> 00:41:58,780
You don't look good.

513
00:41:58,947 --> 00:42:00,864
- I don't? - Well, you've looked better.

514
00:42:01,032 --> 00:42:02,699
You didn't used to look like this.

515
00:42:02,867 --> 00:42:04,786
Can you hold, please?

516
00:42:04,954 --> 00:42:07,539
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn. She paid with Visa.

517
00:42:07,748 --> 00:42:09,833
Here's tonight's worksheet.

518
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,668
Oh, great. Two more free repeaters.

519
00:42:11,835 --> 00:42:14,838
This is Winston Zeddmore. He's here about the job.

520
00:42:15,005 --> 00:42:17,882
Beautiful. You're hired. Ray Stantz, Pete Venkman.

521
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:21,344
- Congratulations. - Can you help me, please?

522
00:42:24,764 --> 00:42:26,266
Welcome aboard.

523
00:42:27,476 --> 00:42:29,893
I don't know where they get these guest conductors.

524
00:42:30,061 --> 00:42:32,813
It's not gonna do him much good to scream at us in German.

525
00:42:32,981 --> 00:42:36,358
Well, I don't think that the man is competent to conduct...

526
00:42:36,527 --> 00:42:37,985
...a major symphony orchestra.

527
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,324
- Could you wait here a minute? - Sure.

528
00:42:49,706 --> 00:42:51,875
Dr. Venkman. This is a surprise.

529
00:42:52,041 --> 00:42:54,376
- That was a wonderful rehearsal. - You heard that?

530
00:42:54,545 --> 00:42:56,461
Yes. You're the best one in your row.

531
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,088
Oh, thank you.

532
00:42:58,298 --> 00:43:01,800
You're good. Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.

533
00:43:01,969 --> 00:43:03,594
I don't have to take this abuse.

534
00:43:03,804 --> 00:43:06,054
I got hundreds of people dying to abuse me.

535
00:43:06,222 --> 00:43:08,266
I know. You're a big celebrity now.

536
00:43:08,434 --> 00:43:11,643
Do you have some information for me on my case?

537
00:43:16,025 --> 00:43:17,650
Who's the stiff?

538
00:43:18,152 --> 00:43:21,362
The stiff happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world.

539
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,364
Do you have information for me, please?

540
00:43:23,532 --> 00:43:26,074
Well, sure, but I prefer to give it to you in private.

541
00:43:26,242 --> 00:43:29,579
- Why don't you tell me now? - Okay. I found the name Zuul for you.

542
00:43:29,746 --> 00:43:35,251
The name Zuul refers to a demigod worshiped around 6000 B.C. By the...

543
00:43:35,628 --> 00:43:37,628
What's that word?

544
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:39,380
- "Hittites." - Hittites...

545
00:43:39,547 --> 00:43:42,634
...the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.

546
00:43:43,552 --> 00:43:46,012
"Zuul was the minion of Gozer."

547
00:43:46,179 --> 00:43:48,389
What's Gozer?

548
00:43:48,556 --> 00:43:52,768
- Gozer was very big in Sumeria. - Well, what's he doing in my icebox?

549
00:43:52,936 --> 00:43:55,938
I'm working on that. If we could get together Thursday night...

550
00:43:56,106 --> 00:43:59,442
...I'm thinking 9-ish, you know, we could exchange information.

551
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:02,903
I can't see you Thursday. I'm busy.

552
00:44:03,072 --> 00:44:06,490
Miss Barrett, you think there is something wrong up here that says:

553
00:44:06,659 --> 00:44:10,827
"He enjoys taking his evenings off and spending it with his clients."

554
00:44:10,996 --> 00:44:13,914
No. I'm making a special exception in your case...

555
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:15,666
...because...

556
00:44:16,001 --> 00:44:17,335
...I respect you.

557
00:44:17,503 --> 00:44:19,628
It's corny, but I respect you as an artist.

558
00:44:19,797 --> 00:44:23,675
As a dresser too. This is a magnificent coordination you have going today.

559
00:44:23,884 --> 00:44:26,344
- See you Thursday. - I'll bring the Roylance Guide...

560
00:44:26,512 --> 00:44:28,721
...and we'll eat and read.

561
00:44:35,396 --> 00:44:37,605
- So who the hell is that? - He's just a friend.

562
00:44:37,773 --> 00:44:39,190
- A friend? - An old friend.

563
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,025
Bye! Well, I'll see you Thursday!

564
00:44:41,193 --> 00:44:44,903
I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you, sir. I'm glad you're feeling much better.

565
00:44:45,072 --> 00:44:47,949
You're still very pale, though. A little sun.

566
00:44:48,117 --> 00:44:50,784
- Well, what does he do? - He's a scientist.

567
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:06,300
This is where we store all the vapors and entities and slimers that we trap.

568
00:45:06,467 --> 00:45:11,847
Very simple, really. A loaded trap here. Open, unlock the system.

569
00:45:12,016 --> 00:45:13,349
Insert the trap.

570
00:45:15,226 --> 00:45:17,186
Release.

571
00:45:18,105 --> 00:45:21,733
Close, lock the system. Set your entry grid.

572
00:45:21,942 --> 00:45:23,358
Neutronize your field.

573
00:45:23,693 --> 00:45:25,485
And...

574
00:45:25,653 --> 00:45:28,280
...when the light is green, the trap is clean.

575
00:45:28,449 --> 00:45:31,409
The ghost is incarcerated here in our custom storage facility.

576
00:45:31,577 --> 00:45:35,163
There's a man from the EPA here to see you. He's waiting in your office.

577
00:45:35,329 --> 00:45:37,956
- EPA? What's he want? - I don't know.

578
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:41,126
All I do know is I've been working two weeks without a break...

579
00:45:41,295 --> 00:45:44,005
...and you promised me you'd hire more help.

580
00:45:44,172 --> 00:45:46,507
Janine, someone with your qualifications...

581
00:45:46,675 --> 00:45:50,552
...would have no trouble finding a topflight job in either...

582
00:45:50,721 --> 00:45:53,556
...the food service or housekeeping industries.

583
00:45:54,307 --> 00:45:58,393
- Are you gonna answer that? - I've quit better jobs than this.

584
00:45:59,103 --> 00:46:01,021
Ghostbusters! What do you want?

585
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:03,775
- Can I help you? - I'm Walter Peck.

586
00:46:03,983 --> 00:46:07,612
I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, the third district.

587
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:10,280
Great. How's it going down there?

588
00:46:12,534 --> 00:46:14,494
Are you Peter Venkman?

589
00:46:15,496 --> 00:46:17,079
Yes, I'm...

590
00:46:17,246 --> 00:46:18,581
...Dr. Venkman.

591
00:46:18,748 --> 00:46:21,541
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?

592
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:25,128
Well, I have Ph.D.'s in parapsychology and psychology.

593
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,715
I see.

594
00:46:27,882 --> 00:46:30,760
And now you catch ghosts.

595
00:46:30,927 --> 00:46:32,929
Yeah. You could say that.

596
00:46:33,387 --> 00:46:35,931
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?

597
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:38,768
- I'm not at liberty to say. - And where do you put...

598
00:46:38,936 --> 00:46:41,813
...these ghosts once you catch them?

599
00:46:42,021 --> 00:46:44,440
Into a storage facility.

600
00:46:44,817 --> 00:46:47,943
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?

601
00:46:48,112 --> 00:46:52,782
- Yes. - And may I see this storage facility?

602
00:46:52,949 --> 00:46:56,327
- No. - And why not, Mr. Venkman?

603
00:46:57,871 --> 00:47:01,123
Because you did not use the magic word.

604
00:47:03,376 --> 00:47:07,045
What is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?

605
00:47:08,382 --> 00:47:09,715
"Please."

606
00:47:11,092 --> 00:47:14,846
May I please see the storage facility, Mr. Venkman?

607
00:47:15,054 --> 00:47:16,514
Why do you want to see it?

608
00:47:16,681 --> 00:47:18,974
Well, because I'm curious.

609
00:47:19,268 --> 00:47:21,561
I want to know more about what you do here.

610
00:47:22,146 --> 00:47:24,563
There've been a lot of wild stories in the media...

611
00:47:24,731 --> 00:47:27,650
...and we want to assess any possible environmental impact...

612
00:47:27,818 --> 00:47:29,152
...from your operation.

613
00:47:29,318 --> 00:47:31,362
For instance, the presence of noxious...

614
00:47:31,572 --> 00:47:34,824
...possibly hazardous waste chemicals in your basement.

615
00:47:34,992 --> 00:47:39,202
Now, you show me what is down there, or I come back with a court order.

616
00:47:40,204 --> 00:47:44,291
You go get a court order, and I'll sue your ass for wrongful prosecution!

617
00:47:45,085 --> 00:47:47,836
You can have it your way, Mr. Venkman.

618
00:47:48,422 --> 00:47:50,922
I'm worried. It's crowded in there, and my data...

619
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:53,885
...points to something big on the horizon.

620
00:47:54,094 --> 00:47:56,012
What do you mean, "big"?

621
00:47:56,597 --> 00:48:01,016
Well, let's say this Twinkie represents the normal amount...

622
00:48:01,184 --> 00:48:03,728
...of psychokinetic energy in the New York area.

623
00:48:03,896 --> 00:48:07,648
According to this morning's sample, it would be a Twinkie...

624
00:48:07,815 --> 00:48:11,360
...35 feet long, weighing approximately 600 pounds.

625
00:48:12,778 --> 00:48:14,447
That's a big Twinkie.

626
00:48:14,614 --> 00:48:17,032
We could be on the verge of a fourfold cross-rip...

627
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:20,536
...a PKE surge of incredible, even dangerous, proportions.

628
00:48:21,121 --> 00:48:24,581
We just had a visit from the Environmental Protection Agency.

629
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:26,918
- How's the grid holding up? - Not good.

630
00:48:27,126 --> 00:48:28,960
Tell him about the Twinkie.

631
00:48:29,922 --> 00:48:31,463
What about the Twinkie?

632
00:49:26,728 --> 00:49:28,980
- Oh, Dana, it's you. - Hello, Louis.

633
00:49:29,188 --> 00:49:31,983
You gotta come in here. You're missing a classic party.

634
00:49:32,192 --> 00:49:36,320
Yes, well, I would, Louis, but I have a date coming over.

635
00:49:39,532 --> 00:49:41,157
You made a date...

636
00:49:41,326 --> 00:49:47,581
...tonight? - Well, I'm sorry, Louis. I forgot.

637
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:52,378
Oh, that's okay. You can bring him along.

638
00:49:52,838 --> 00:49:56,007
All right. Maybe we'll stop by, okay?

639
00:49:56,215 --> 00:49:57,967
That's great. I'll tell everybody.

640
00:49:58,135 --> 00:50:01,094
We're gonna play Twister, we're gonna do some breakdancing...

641
00:50:01,262 --> 00:50:03,054
Hey...

642
00:50:03,889 --> 00:50:07,684
Hey, let me in! It's Louis! Somebody, let me in!

643
00:50:32,793 --> 00:50:34,336
Hello?

644
00:50:34,503 --> 00:50:36,588
Hi, Mom.

645
00:50:36,757 --> 00:50:38,423
I've been busy.

646
00:50:38,592 --> 00:50:41,092
Well... No, everything is fine.

647
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:44,472
Yeah. No, just that one time.

648
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:46,724
Oh, I am.

649
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:49,351
I will.

650
00:50:50,603 --> 00:50:55,273
I won't. Mom, I have to go. I have a date.

651
00:50:55,525 --> 00:50:59,652
Yes. No, no one you know. It's...

652
00:51:00,614 --> 00:51:03,407
Well, he's a Ghostbuster.

653
00:51:03,992 --> 00:51:06,159
Those guys on TV.

654
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:08,913
Yes, well, I'll have to let you know.

655
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:11,539
Okay. Love to Dad.

656
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:15,293
Right. Bye. Bye.

657
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:37,733
Oh, shit.

658
00:52:09,224 --> 00:52:12,476
Do you have any Excedrin or Extra Strength Tylenol?

659
00:52:12,643 --> 00:52:15,855
Gee, I think all I got is acetylsalicylic acid. Generic.

660
00:52:16,021 --> 00:52:19,858
I can get 600 tablets of that for the same price as 300 of the name brand.

661
00:52:20,025 --> 00:52:22,277
Makes good financial sense. Good advice.

662
00:52:22,445 --> 00:52:25,114
This is real smoked salmon from Nova Scotia, Canada...

663
00:52:25,282 --> 00:52:26,614
...24.95 a pound.

664
00:52:26,782 --> 00:52:28,867
It only cost me 14. 12 after tax, though.

665
00:52:29,034 --> 00:52:30,952
I'm giving this as a promotional expense.

666
00:52:31,121 --> 00:52:35,039
That's why I invited clients instead of friends. Having a good time, Marv?

667
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:37,876
How you doing? Have some Brie. It's at room temperature.

668
00:52:38,043 --> 00:52:39,711
You think it's too warm for Brie?

669
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,047
Louis, I'm going home.

670
00:52:42,215 --> 00:52:44,884
Don't leave yet. Listen, maybe if we start dancing...

671
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:47,052
...other people will join in.

672
00:52:47,219 --> 00:52:49,054
Okay.

673
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:54,726
Oh, don't move. I just gotta get the door.

674
00:52:56,146 --> 00:52:57,855
- Ted! Annette! - Hi.

675
00:52:58,023 --> 00:53:00,398
I'm glad you could come. Give me your coats.

676
00:53:00,567 --> 00:53:03,027
Everybody, this is Ted and Annette Fleming.

677
00:53:03,195 --> 00:53:04,527
How are you?

678
00:53:04,695 --> 00:53:07,530
Ted has a small carpet-cleaning business in receivership.

679
00:53:07,699 --> 00:53:10,951
Annette's drawing a salary from a deferred bonus from two years ago.

680
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:15,164
They got 15,000 left on the house at 8 percent.

681
00:53:15,331 --> 00:53:17,708
So they're okay!

682
00:53:17,876 --> 00:53:20,126
Does anybody want to play Parcheesi?

683
00:53:23,255 --> 00:53:25,048
Okay, who brought the dog?

684
00:53:46,947 --> 00:53:51,992
Help! There's a bear loose in my apartment! Help! Help!

685
00:53:54,371 --> 00:53:55,746
Help!

686
00:53:55,914 --> 00:53:58,958
- What? - A bear in his apartment.

687
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,672
I'm gonna bring this up at the tenants' meeting.

688
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,050
There's not supposed to be any pets in the building.

689
00:54:24,108 --> 00:54:28,820
Let me in. There's gotta be a way in here. I gotta get...

690
00:54:32,032 --> 00:54:34,909
Somebody, let me in!

691
00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:42,543
Nice doggy.

692
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:44,670
Cute little pooch.

693
00:54:44,838 --> 00:54:47,715
Maybe I got a Milk-Bone.

694
00:55:07,193 --> 00:55:09,110
- What happened? - Some moron brought...

695
00:55:09,278 --> 00:55:12,364
...a cougar to a party, and it went berserk.

696
00:55:14,199 --> 00:55:17,577
Hi, I'm going up to Dana Barrett's. Okay.

697
00:55:36,764 --> 00:55:38,806
Hello?

698
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,853
That's a different look for you, isn't it?

699
00:55:44,021 --> 00:55:46,065
Are you the Keymaster?

700
00:55:47,858 --> 00:55:49,943
Not that I know of.

701
00:56:01,914 --> 00:56:03,916
Are you the Keymaster?

702
00:56:04,083 --> 00:56:05,416
Yes.

703
00:56:05,793 --> 00:56:08,753
I'm a friend of his. He told me to meet him here.

704
00:56:09,422 --> 00:56:11,965
- I didn't get your name. - I am Zuul.

705
00:56:12,132 --> 00:56:14,300
I am the Gatekeeper.

706
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:24,936
- What are we doing today, Zuul? - Prepare for the coming of Gozer.

707
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:27,271
Gozer, huh?

708
00:56:28,358 --> 00:56:30,108
The Destructor.

709
00:56:38,326 --> 00:56:39,659
Are we still going out?

710
00:56:42,789 --> 00:56:46,375
You know, you could pick up the place if you're expecting someone.

711
00:56:47,043 --> 00:56:49,961
Do you want this body?

712
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:52,088
Is this a trick question?

713
00:56:55,635 --> 00:56:57,969
I guess the roses worked, huh?

714
00:56:58,137 --> 00:57:00,179
Take me now...

715
00:57:00,347 --> 00:57:01,974
...sub-creature.

716
00:57:02,141 --> 00:57:03,976
We never talk anymore.

717
00:57:04,728 --> 00:57:10,106
Easy. I make it a rule never to get involved with possessed people.

718
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:14,152
It's more of a guideline than a rule.

719
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,737
You know, I can...

720
00:57:15,905 --> 00:57:18,322
I want you inside me.

721
00:57:19,617 --> 00:57:21,242
Go ahead. No, I can't.

722
00:57:21,411 --> 00:57:24,121
Sounds like you got at least two people in there already.

723
00:57:24,289 --> 00:57:26,123
Might be a little crowded.

724
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:28,541
Come on, why don't you just quit trying...

725
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:31,836
...to upset and disturb Dr. Venkman and just relax.

726
00:57:32,005 --> 00:57:35,548
Lie down there. Relax. Put your hands on your chest.

727
00:57:35,717 --> 00:57:38,552
What I'd really like to do is talk to Dana.

728
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:40,596
I want to talk to Dana.

729
00:57:40,764 --> 00:57:42,181
Dana, it's Peter.

730
00:57:42,347 --> 00:57:46,059
There is no Dana. There is only Zuul.

731
00:57:46,268 --> 00:57:48,186
Oh, Zuulie, you nut. Come on.

732
00:57:48,771 --> 00:57:51,106
Come on, I want to talk to Dana. Dana.

733
00:57:51,273 --> 00:57:53,650
Just relax. Come on. Dana.

734
00:57:53,818 --> 00:57:55,693
Dana. Can I talk to Dana?

735
00:57:55,862 --> 00:57:59,614
There is no Dana, only Zuul.

736
00:57:59,782 --> 00:58:02,367
What a lovely singing voice you must have.

737
00:58:02,534 --> 00:58:04,536
Now, I'm gonna count to three, Zuulie.

738
00:58:04,704 --> 00:58:06,288
And if I don't talk to Dana...

739
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:10,166
...there's gonna be some real trouble in this apartment, I think.

740
00:58:10,335 --> 00:58:11,751
One.

741
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:15,797
Two.

742
00:58:17,382 --> 00:58:19,050
Two and a half.

743
00:59:02,762 --> 00:59:04,471
Please come down.

744
00:59:06,474 --> 00:59:11,936
I am the Keymaster. The Destructor is coming.

745
00:59:12,105 --> 00:59:15,190
The Traveler. The Destroyer.

746
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:22,739
Gatekeeper.

747
00:59:28,454 --> 00:59:29,788
I am Vinz.

748
00:59:29,956 --> 00:59:32,373
Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

749
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:36,128
Volguus Zildrohar, Lord of the Sebouillia. Are you the Gatekeeper?

750
00:59:36,295 --> 00:59:39,255
He pulls the wagon, I make the deals. You want a ride?

751
00:59:48,474 --> 00:59:52,143
Wait for the sign. Then all prisoners will be released.

752
00:59:52,311 --> 00:59:55,898
You will perish in flame, you and all your kind! Gatekeeper!

753
00:59:56,273 --> 00:59:57,608
What an asshole.

754
01:00:04,032 --> 01:00:06,824
- Dropping off or picking up? - Dropping off.

755
01:00:06,992 --> 01:00:08,994
Just a moment.

756
01:00:12,498 --> 01:00:14,206
- You a Ghostbuster? - Yes.

757
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:16,668
We picked up this guy. We don't know what to do.

758
01:00:16,835 --> 01:00:19,338
Bellevue doesn't want him. I'm afraid to lock him up.

759
01:00:19,505 --> 01:00:22,423
I know you guys are into this stuff, so I figured we'd check.

760
01:00:22,592 --> 01:00:24,175
All right.

761
01:00:27,221 --> 01:00:29,347
Are you the Gatekeeper?

762
01:00:32,351 --> 01:00:34,686
You better bring him inside.

763
01:00:35,813 --> 01:00:38,315
You are so kind to take care of that man.

764
01:00:38,483 --> 01:00:40,358
You know, you are a real humanitarian.

765
01:00:40,525 --> 01:00:42,985
I don't think he's human.

766
01:00:50,954 --> 01:00:52,496
What did you say your name was?

767
01:00:53,539 --> 01:00:55,706
Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer.

768
01:00:55,875 --> 01:00:58,043
According to this, his name's Louis Tully.

769
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:00,628
Lives on Central Park West.

770
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:04,800
Do you want some coffee, Mr. Tully?

771
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:07,010
- Do I? - Yes, have some.

772
01:01:07,219 --> 01:01:09,512
Yes, have some.

773
01:01:10,847 --> 01:01:13,891
Vinz, you said before you were waiting for a sign.

774
01:01:14,059 --> 01:01:16,811
- What sign are you waiting for? - Gozer the Traveler.

775
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,231
He will come in one of the pre-chosen forms.

776
01:01:19,398 --> 01:01:23,652
During rectification of the Vuldronaii, the Traveler came as a large Torb.

777
01:01:24,237 --> 01:01:27,572
Then, during the third reconciliation of the Meketrex supplicants...

778
01:01:27,739 --> 01:01:31,076
...they chose a new form for him, that of a giant Sloar!

779
01:01:31,244 --> 01:01:33,744
Many Shubs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted...

780
01:01:33,954 --> 01:01:36,581
...in the depths of the Sloar that day, I can tell you.

781
01:01:36,748 --> 01:01:40,085
- Egon. - Excuse me.

782
01:01:42,088 --> 01:01:45,257
There's something very strange about that man.

783
01:01:47,467 --> 01:01:50,219
I'm usually very psychic, and I have a terrible feeling...

784
01:01:50,387 --> 01:01:53,472
...that something awful is gonna happen to you.

785
01:01:54,349 --> 01:01:56,976
I'm afraid you're gonna die.

786
01:01:58,938 --> 01:02:00,563
I'll get it.

787
01:02:03,275 --> 01:02:05,527
- Hello? - Egon, it's Peter.

788
01:02:05,695 --> 01:02:08,947
- Thanks, I've got it. - I have news from the world of Gozer.

789
01:02:09,114 --> 01:02:12,284
- What is it, Peter? - I'm here with Dana Barrett.

790
01:02:12,452 --> 01:02:15,077
It seems the Goz has been putting some moves...

791
01:02:15,246 --> 01:02:18,289
...on my would-be girlfriend. - How is she?

792
01:02:18,458 --> 01:02:21,960
I think we can get her a guest shot on Wild Kingdom.

793
01:02:22,128 --> 01:02:25,088
I just whacked her up with about 300 cc's of Thorazine.

794
01:02:25,255 --> 01:02:29,384
She's gonna take a little nap now, but she says she's the Gatekeeper.

795
01:02:29,552 --> 01:02:31,969
- Does that make any sense to you? - Some.

796
01:02:32,137 --> 01:02:34,722
I just met the Keymaster. He's here with me now.

797
01:02:34,891 --> 01:02:37,641
Oh, wonderful. We have to get these two together.

798
01:02:40,146 --> 01:02:42,563
I think that would be extraordinarily dangerous.

799
01:02:42,731 --> 01:02:46,068
Okay, well, hold onto him. I'll be there in a little while.

800
01:02:46,235 --> 01:02:48,445
Good.

801
01:02:48,612 --> 01:02:53,532
Thank you, Vinz. We have to find Ray. I need him here immediately.

802
01:02:58,081 --> 01:03:01,500
Bad news, honey, I gotta go to work.

803
01:03:01,666 --> 01:03:04,543
Hey, will you stay here in bed until I get back?

804
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:18,516
- Hey, Ray, do you believe in God? - Never met him.

805
01:03:18,684 --> 01:03:23,188
Yeah, well, I do. And I love Jesus' style, you know?

806
01:03:23,356 --> 01:03:27,317
This roof cap is made of a magnesium-tungsten alloy.

807
01:03:27,485 --> 01:03:29,820
What are you so involved with there?

808
01:03:29,987 --> 01:03:33,322
These are blueprints for the ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment...

809
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:36,284
...and they're very, very strange.

810
01:03:36,452 --> 01:03:39,996
Hey, Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about...

811
01:03:40,164 --> 01:03:44,166
...the last days, when the dead would rise from the grave?

812
01:03:44,585 --> 01:03:47,378
I remember Revelations 7: 12.

813
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,005
And I looked as he opened the sixth seal.

814
01:03:50,173 --> 01:03:52,134
And behold, there was a great earthquake.

815
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:54,719
And the sun became as black as sackcloth.

816
01:03:55,096 --> 01:03:56,637
And the moon became as blood.

817
01:03:56,806 --> 01:03:59,724
And the seas boiled. And the skies fell.

818
01:04:01,518 --> 01:04:04,396
- Judgment day. - Judgment day.

819
01:04:04,563 --> 01:04:07,565
Every ancient religion has its myth about the end of the world.

820
01:04:07,733 --> 01:04:11,402
Myth? Ray, has it ever occurred to you...

821
01:04:11,612 --> 01:04:13,737
...maybe the reason we've been so busy...

822
01:04:13,905 --> 01:04:17,032
...is because the dead have been rising from the grave?

823
01:04:22,123 --> 01:04:26,626
- How about a little music? - Yeah.

824
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:07,083
This way.

825
01:05:15,635 --> 01:05:20,096
Excuse me. Excuse me. Just where do you think you're going?

826
01:05:20,264 --> 01:05:23,432
Step aside, or you'll be arrested for interfering with the police.

827
01:05:23,601 --> 01:05:26,143
No. Hold on. I've seen TV. You can't come in here...

828
01:05:26,311 --> 01:05:27,811
...without a warrant or a writ.

829
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:31,106
Cease and Desist All Commerce order. Seizure of Premises.

830
01:05:31,275 --> 01:05:34,068
Ban of Public Utilities for Non-Licensed Waste Handlers...

831
01:05:34,237 --> 01:05:36,987
...and a federal Entry and Inspection order.

832
01:05:37,907 --> 01:05:40,242
Vinz, there's one more test I'd like to perform.

833
01:05:40,409 --> 01:05:44,663
Egon. I tried to stop them. He says they have a warrant.

834
01:05:44,829 --> 01:05:48,500
- Excuse me, this is private property. - Shut this off. Shut these all off.

835
01:05:48,708 --> 01:05:51,418
I'm warning you. Turning off these machines is hazardous.

836
01:05:51,586 --> 01:05:54,088
I'll tell you hazardous. You're facing prosecution...

837
01:05:54,257 --> 01:05:56,465
...for a half-a-dozen environmental violations.

838
01:05:56,634 --> 01:05:59,177
You shut off these beams, or we shut them off for you.

839
01:06:03,932 --> 01:06:06,768
Understand, this is a high-voltage laser containment system.

840
01:06:06,936 --> 01:06:09,688
Turning it off would be like dropping a bomb in the city.

841
01:06:09,855 --> 01:06:13,190
Don't patronize me. I'm not stupid, like the people you bilk.

842
01:06:13,358 --> 01:06:16,777
At ease, officer. I'm Peter Venkman. There's been a misunderstanding...

843
01:06:16,945 --> 01:06:19,030
...and I want to cooperate in any way I can.

844
01:06:19,197 --> 01:06:21,615
Forget it. You had your chance to cooperate...

845
01:06:21,784 --> 01:06:25,536
...but you thought it'd be more fun to insult me. Now it is my turn, wise-ass.

846
01:06:25,704 --> 01:06:27,706
He wants to shut down the protection grid.

847
01:06:27,873 --> 01:06:30,541
You shut that thing down, we won't be held responsible...

848
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:34,461
- You'll be responsible. Shut it off. - No, we won't be held responsible.

849
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:37,632
Don't shut it off. I'm warning you.

850
01:06:38,759 --> 01:06:41,385
I've never seen anything like this. I don't know...

851
01:06:41,554 --> 01:06:45,056
Yeah, I'm not interested in your opinion. Just shut it off.

852
01:06:46,391 --> 01:06:48,393
My friend, don't be a jerk.

853
01:06:48,561 --> 01:06:51,186
- Step aside. - Lf he does that again, you shoot him.

854
01:06:51,355 --> 01:06:53,523
You do your job. Don't tell me how to do mine.

855
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:56,400
- Thank you, officer. - Shut it off!

856
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:20,550
Oh, shit.

857
01:07:35,608 --> 01:07:38,275
Clear the building!

858
01:08:07,556 --> 01:08:10,307
This is it. This is the sign.

859
01:08:10,476 --> 01:08:14,396
Yeah, it's a sign, all right. We're going out of business.

860
01:08:24,364 --> 01:08:26,408
Hey, aim up there.

861
01:08:26,867 --> 01:08:28,784
- What happened? - Storage facility blew.

862
01:08:28,953 --> 01:08:31,496
- He shut off the protection grid. - Oh, great.

863
01:08:31,663 --> 01:08:33,456
- That's bad, isn't it? - Yeah.

864
01:08:33,623 --> 01:08:36,167
- Where's the Keymaster? - Shit.

865
01:08:36,377 --> 01:08:38,670
- Who's the Keymaster? - Oh, come on.

866
01:08:39,003 --> 01:08:41,797
Hold it. I want this man arrested.

867
01:08:41,966 --> 01:08:45,426
These men are in criminal violation of the Environmental Protection Act.

868
01:08:45,594 --> 01:08:48,179
- This explosion is a direct result of it. - Your mother!

869
01:08:48,389 --> 01:08:50,681
Come on, hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

870
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:41,064
Columbia Building, 57th Street. I'm in a hurry, so let's not dawdle.

871
01:10:35,287 --> 01:10:37,454
Hey, guard!

872
01:10:37,622 --> 01:10:39,957
Look, I want to make a phone call.

873
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:42,627
I just work with these guys. I wasn't even there.

874
01:10:42,795 --> 01:10:45,963
The structure of this roof cap is like the telemetry tracker...

875
01:10:46,131 --> 01:10:50,134
...that NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in deep space.

876
01:10:50,301 --> 01:10:56,306
Cold-riveted girders with cores of pure selenium.

877
01:10:56,516 --> 01:10:58,643
Everybody getting this so far?

878
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:02,104
So what? I guess they just don't make them like they used to.

879
01:11:02,273 --> 01:11:04,606
No. Nobody ever made them like this.

880
01:11:04,774 --> 01:11:09,487
The architect was either a certified genius or an authentic wacko.

881
01:11:09,654 --> 01:11:12,739
Ray, for a moment...

882
01:11:12,908 --> 01:11:15,993
...pretend that I don't know anything about metallurgy...

883
01:11:16,161 --> 01:11:21,457
...engineering or physics and just tell me what the hell is going on.

884
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,667
You never studied.

885
01:11:24,252 --> 01:11:28,088
The whole building is a huge superconductive antenna...

886
01:11:28,256 --> 01:11:30,675
...that was designed and built for the purpose...

887
01:11:30,842 --> 01:11:34,011
...of pulling in and concentrating spiritual turbulence.

888
01:11:34,179 --> 01:11:39,850
Your girlfriend lives in the corner penthouse of spook central.

889
01:11:41,353 --> 01:11:43,854
She's not my girlfriend.

890
01:11:44,023 --> 01:11:47,524
I find her interesting because she's a client and sleeps above her covers.

891
01:11:47,693 --> 01:11:51,695
Four feet above her covers. She barks. She drools. She claws.

892
01:11:51,863 --> 01:11:54,323
It's not the girl, Peter, it's the building.

893
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:58,536
Something terrible is about to enter our world. This building is the door.

894
01:11:58,703 --> 01:12:00,662
The architect's name was lvo Shandor.

895
01:12:00,831 --> 01:12:04,458
I found it in Tobin's Spirit Guide. He was also a doctor.

896
01:12:04,627 --> 01:12:07,127
He performed a lot of unnecessary surgery.

897
01:12:07,296 --> 01:12:10,172
And then, in 1920, he started a secret society.

898
01:12:10,341 --> 01:12:14,135
- Let me guess. Gozer worshipers. - Right.

899
01:12:15,011 --> 01:12:16,511
No studying.

900
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:22,225
After World War I, Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.

901
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:28,899
He wasn't alone. He had close to a thousand followers when he died.

902
01:12:29,109 --> 01:12:31,027
They conducted rituals up on the roof...

903
01:12:31,194 --> 01:12:34,738
...bizarre rituals intended to bring about the end of the world.

904
01:12:34,907 --> 01:12:37,908
And now it looks like it may actually happen.

905
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:47,417
We have to get out of here and find a judge or something.

906
01:12:47,627 --> 01:12:51,088
Hey, wait a minute. Hey, hey, hey. Hold it.

907
01:12:51,422 --> 01:12:53,423
Are we going to go before a judge to say...

908
01:12:53,591 --> 01:12:56,844
...that a Babylonian god is gonna drop in on Central Park West...

909
01:12:57,011 --> 01:13:00,097
...and start tearing up the city? - Sumerian, not Babylonian.

910
01:13:00,265 --> 01:13:02,934
- Yeah, big difference. - No offense...

911
01:13:03,143 --> 01:13:04,769
...but I gotta get my own lawyer.

912
01:13:04,936 --> 01:13:07,563
Okay, Ghostbusters. The mayor wants to see you guys.

913
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:09,649
The whole island's going crazy. Let's go.

914
01:13:09,942 --> 01:13:12,944
I gotta split. The mayor wants to rap with me about some things.

915
01:13:36,969 --> 01:13:40,637
- I am the Keymaster. - I am the Gatekeeper.

916
01:14:22,972 --> 01:14:27,518
- Back. Back. Stay back. - Stay back. Stay back.

917
01:14:34,943 --> 01:14:38,029
I've got a city blowing up, and you aren't giving me answers.

918
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:41,198
We're blocking the bridges, the roads...

919
01:14:41,365 --> 01:14:42,867
The Ghostbusters are here.

920
01:14:43,034 --> 01:14:45,787
The Ghostbusters. Okay, the Ghostbusters.

921
01:14:45,953 --> 01:14:47,537
Hey, and where's this Peck?

922
01:14:47,706 --> 01:14:51,792
Peck. I am Walter Peck, sir, and I am prepared to make a full report.

923
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,337
These men are consummate snowball artists.

924
01:14:54,505 --> 01:14:57,297
They use sense and nerve gases to induce hallucinations.

925
01:14:57,466 --> 01:15:00,801
People think they're seeing ghosts, and they call these bozos...

926
01:15:00,969 --> 01:15:03,386
...who show up to deal with the problem...

927
01:15:03,555 --> 01:15:05,389
...with a fake electronic light show.

928
01:15:05,556 --> 01:15:08,391
Everything was fine with our system until the power grid...

929
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:12,188
...was shut off by dickless here. - They caused an explosion.

930
01:15:12,355 --> 01:15:17,484
- Is this true? - Yes, it's true. This man has no dick.

931
01:15:19,070 --> 01:15:23,032
Hey, come on. Knock it off. Hey, break it up!

932
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:25,033
- All right. - Well, that's what I heard.

933
01:15:25,202 --> 01:15:26,661
This is City Hall.

934
01:15:26,828 --> 01:15:29,872
Now, what am I gonna do here, John? What is this?

935
01:15:30,039 --> 01:15:32,750
All I know is that was no light show we saw this morning.

936
01:15:32,917 --> 01:15:36,837
I've seen every form of combustion known to man...

937
01:15:37,005 --> 01:15:38,881
...but this beats the hell out of me.

938
01:15:39,048 --> 01:15:41,509
The walls in the 53rd Precinct were bleeding.

939
01:15:41,676 --> 01:15:44,177
- How do you explain that? - Good afternoon, gentlemen.

940
01:15:44,345 --> 01:15:45,930
Oh, Your Eminence.

941
01:15:51,895 --> 01:15:54,521
- How are you, Lenny? - You're looking good, Mike.

942
01:15:54,689 --> 01:15:58,275
We're in a real fix here. What do you think I should do?

943
01:15:58,443 --> 01:16:01,362
Officially, the church will not take any position...

944
01:16:01,529 --> 01:16:04,907
...on the religious implications of these phenomena.

945
01:16:05,074 --> 01:16:06,576
Personally, Lenny...

946
01:16:07,034 --> 01:16:10,954
...I think it's a sign from God. But don't quote me on that.

947
01:16:11,331 --> 01:16:12,789
That's a smart move, Mike.

948
01:16:12,957 --> 01:16:14,625
I won't call a press conference...

949
01:16:14,835 --> 01:16:17,627
...and tell everyone to start praying.

950
01:16:19,631 --> 01:16:22,425
I'm Winston Zeddmore, Your Honor.

951
01:16:22,592 --> 01:16:24,969
I've only been with the company for a couple weeks.

952
01:16:25,136 --> 01:16:27,805
But I gotta tell you, these things are real.

953
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:31,975
Since I joined these men, I have seen shit that'll turn you white.

954
01:16:32,853 --> 01:16:34,478
Well, you can believe Mr. Pecker.

955
01:16:34,645 --> 01:16:37,148
- My name is Peck. - Or you could accept the fact...

956
01:16:37,356 --> 01:16:40,734
...that this city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportions.

957
01:16:40,903 --> 01:16:44,613
- Well, what do you mean, "biblical"? - What he means is Old Testament.

958
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:46,908
- Real wrath-of-God-type stuff. - Exactly.

959
01:16:47,074 --> 01:16:50,493
Fire and brimstone down from the skies. Rivers and seas boiling.

960
01:16:50,662 --> 01:16:53,122
Forty years of darkness. Earthquakes. Volcanoes.

961
01:16:53,289 --> 01:16:55,457
- Dead rising from the grave. - Human sacrifice.

962
01:16:55,626 --> 01:16:58,836
Dogs and cats living together. Mass hysteria.

963
01:16:59,003 --> 01:17:01,171
Enough! I get the point.

964
01:17:03,007 --> 01:17:04,341
But what if you're wrong?

965
01:17:04,509 --> 01:17:07,845
If I'm wrong, nothing happens. We go to jail, peacefully, quietly.

966
01:17:08,012 --> 01:17:11,515
We'll enjoy it. But if I'm right...

967
01:17:11,682 --> 01:17:14,851
...and we can stop this thing...

968
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:20,440
Lenny, you will have saved the lives...

969
01:17:20,609 --> 01:17:24,862
...of millions of registered voters.

970
01:17:30,327 --> 01:17:34,204
I don't believe you're seriously considering listening to these men.

971
01:17:41,546 --> 01:17:44,047
Get him out of here.

972
01:17:44,216 --> 01:17:46,841
- Bye. - I'll fix you. I'm gonna fix you.

973
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:49,845
I'll get you a nice fruit basket. I'm going to miss him.

974
01:17:50,012 --> 01:17:51,430
All right. All right.

975
01:17:51,974 --> 01:17:55,350
We got work to do. Now, what do you need from me?

976
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,242
Come on, let's run some red lights!

977
01:19:14,139 --> 01:19:16,056
Hello, New York.

978
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:24,981
Hello, everybody!

979
01:19:25,149 --> 01:19:28,485
Dr. Ray Stantz, would you please? The heart of the Ghostbusters.

980
01:19:28,653 --> 01:19:31,822
Thank you. They love you. They love you here.

981
01:19:32,407 --> 01:19:36,952
- I like that shirt, friend. - Ghostbusters! All right!

982
01:19:39,622 --> 01:19:42,750
Gotta run. Got a date with a ghost.

983
01:19:42,917 --> 01:19:45,668
Okay, whatever happens, let's be professional.

984
01:20:17,368 --> 01:20:20,371
We might have to put a little overtime in on this one.

985
01:21:15,342 --> 01:21:18,429
There they are. There they are.

986
01:21:25,186 --> 01:21:27,896
I was in no way prepared for that.

987
01:21:28,773 --> 01:21:31,774
It's all right. Don't worry. We're fine. We can handle it.

988
01:21:31,943 --> 01:21:34,278
We can take it. They want to play rough.

989
01:21:34,445 --> 01:21:38,948
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

990
01:21:40,659 --> 01:21:42,243
- Wanna play rough? - Yeah.

991
01:21:42,412 --> 01:21:44,162
Let's do it.

992
01:22:09,189 --> 01:22:11,231
Where are we?

993
01:22:11,399 --> 01:22:15,485
It looks like we're in the teens somewhere.

994
01:22:15,694 --> 01:22:19,948
Well, when we get to 20, tell me. I'm gonna throw up.

995
01:22:51,523 --> 01:22:56,150
- Twenty-two. Is this it? - Yep.

996
01:23:05,036 --> 01:23:07,704
Art deco. Very nice.

997
01:23:07,872 --> 01:23:10,748
- Where is it? - It's at the end of the hall.

998
01:23:51,207 --> 01:23:53,833
Hey, where do these stairs go?

999
01:23:56,378 --> 01:23:58,046
They go up.

1000
01:24:02,761 --> 01:24:05,345
Okay, go ahead. Come on. Go ahead.

1001
01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:08,431
Watch it. Go ahead.

1002
01:24:47,721 --> 01:24:49,097
Dana.

1003
01:25:03,445 --> 01:25:07,448
Okay, so she's a dog.

1004
01:25:46,905 --> 01:25:48,614
It's a girl.

1005
01:25:53,997 --> 01:25:56,372
- It's Gozer. - I thought Gozer was a man.

1006
01:25:56,541 --> 01:26:00,377
- It's whatever it wants to be. - Whatever it is, it's gotta get by us.

1007
01:26:00,545 --> 01:26:02,045
Right.

1008
01:26:02,713 --> 01:26:04,715
Go get her, Ray!

1009
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:19,229
Gozer the Gozerian?

1010
01:26:21,565 --> 01:26:26,653
Good evening. As a duly designated representative of the city...

1011
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:28,529
...county and state of New York...

1012
01:26:28,698 --> 01:26:31,199
...I order you to cease all supernatural activity...

1013
01:26:31,367 --> 01:26:33,243
...and return to your place of origin...

1014
01:26:33,453 --> 01:26:36,246
...or to the nearest convenient parallel dimension.

1015
01:26:36,456 --> 01:26:39,082
That ought to do it. Thanks very much, Ray.

1016
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:41,835
Are you a god?

1017
01:26:48,342 --> 01:26:53,764
- No. - Then die!

1018
01:27:17,622 --> 01:27:23,752
Ray, when someone asks you if you're a god, you say, "Yes."

1019
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:29,131
All right. This chick is toast.

1020
01:27:41,436 --> 01:27:43,939
- Got your stick? - Holding it.

1021
01:27:45,984 --> 01:27:47,442
Heat them up!

1022
01:27:47,902 --> 01:27:49,319
Smoking!

1023
01:27:49,988 --> 01:27:52,823
- Make them hard. - Ready!

1024
01:27:52,990 --> 01:27:56,243
Let's show this prehistoric bitch how we do things downtown.

1025
01:27:58,829 --> 01:28:00,288
Throw it!

1026
01:28:09,172 --> 01:28:13,010
- Nimble little minx, isn't she? - We better go full stream.

1027
01:28:13,176 --> 01:28:15,470
Aim for the flattop.

1028
01:28:25,273 --> 01:28:27,024
Wasn't so hard.

1029
01:28:33,363 --> 01:28:34,864
We neutronized it.

1030
01:28:35,033 --> 01:28:37,658
You know what that means? A complete particle reversal.

1031
01:28:37,827 --> 01:28:40,662
And we had the tools. We had the talent.

1032
01:28:40,829 --> 01:28:43,122
It's Miller time.

1033
01:28:43,291 --> 01:28:47,961
- Ray, this looks extraordinarily bad. - Oh, no.

1034
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:49,630
What?

1035
01:28:59,181 --> 01:29:00,890
Look out!

1036
01:29:23,622 --> 01:29:29,586
Sub-creatures. Gozer the Gozerian, Gozer the Destructor...

1037
01:29:29,753 --> 01:29:34,382
...Volguus Zildrohar the Traveler has come.

1038
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:37,426
Choose and perish.

1039
01:29:37,636 --> 01:29:41,097
What do you mean, "choose"? We don't understand.

1040
01:29:41,265 --> 01:29:46,936
Choose. Choose the form of the Destructor.

1041
01:29:47,145 --> 01:29:51,733
Oh, I get it. I get it. Oh, very cute.

1042
01:29:52,275 --> 01:29:55,112
Whatever we think of. If we think of J. Edgar Hoover...

1043
01:29:55,279 --> 01:29:58,573
...J. Edgar Hoover will appear and destroy us, so empty your heads.

1044
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:01,618
Don't think of anything. We've only got one shot at this.

1045
01:30:01,786 --> 01:30:05,622
The choice is made.

1046
01:30:05,789 --> 01:30:08,041
The Traveler has come.

1047
01:30:08,208 --> 01:30:10,292
Nobody choosed anything.

1048
01:30:10,461 --> 01:30:11,920
- Did you choose anything? - No.

1049
01:30:12,087 --> 01:30:13,421
- Did you? - My mind is blank.

1050
01:30:13,588 --> 01:30:15,966
I didn't choose anything!

1051
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,476
I couldn't help it.

1052
01:30:28,479 --> 01:30:30,646
It just popped in there.

1053
01:30:31,314 --> 01:30:34,900
What? What just popped in there?

1054
01:30:35,069 --> 01:30:37,945
- I tried to think... - Look!

1055
01:30:38,905 --> 01:30:41,449
- No! It can't be. - What is it?

1056
01:30:41,617 --> 01:30:43,326
- It can't be. - What did you do, Ray?

1057
01:30:43,493 --> 01:30:45,619
Oh, shit.

1058
01:30:56,506 --> 01:30:58,591
It's the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

1059
01:31:30,207 --> 01:31:32,208
There's something you don't see every day.

1060
01:31:32,376 --> 01:31:34,211
I tried to think of a harmless thing.

1061
01:31:34,377 --> 01:31:36,378
Something I loved from my childhood.

1062
01:31:36,546 --> 01:31:41,384
Something that could never, ever possibly destroy us. Mr. Stay Puft.

1063
01:31:41,551 --> 01:31:43,552
Nice thinking, Ray.

1064
01:31:44,555 --> 01:31:46,555
We used to roast Stay Puft marshmallows...

1065
01:31:46,724 --> 01:31:48,557
...by the fire at Camp Waconda.

1066
01:31:50,353 --> 01:31:54,564
Ray, has gone bye-bye, Egon. What have you got left?

1067
01:31:54,899 --> 01:32:00,069
Sorry, Venkman. I'm terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought.

1068
01:32:10,081 --> 01:32:13,082
- Oh, no. - Mother pus bucket.

1069
01:32:17,838 --> 01:32:20,381
Nobody steps on a church in my town.

1070
01:32:20,550 --> 01:32:23,510
One, two, three, roast him.

1071
01:32:43,322 --> 01:32:44,948
Funny, us going out like this.

1072
01:32:45,115 --> 01:32:47,449
Killed by a 100-foot marshmallow man.

1073
01:32:47,618 --> 01:32:50,787
We've been going about this wrong. This Mr. Stay Puft is a sailor.

1074
01:32:50,954 --> 01:32:54,791
He's in New York. We get this guy laid, we won't have any trouble.

1075
01:32:58,712 --> 01:33:01,756
I have a radical idea. The door swings both ways.

1076
01:33:01,923 --> 01:33:04,426
We could reverse the particle flow through the gate.

1077
01:33:04,594 --> 01:33:06,427
How?

1078
01:33:06,595 --> 01:33:08,805
- We'll cross the streams. - Excuse me, Egon.

1079
01:33:08,972 --> 01:33:10,765
You said crossing the streams was bad.

1080
01:33:10,932 --> 01:33:14,060
- Cross the streams. - You're gonna endanger us.

1081
01:33:14,228 --> 01:33:15,979
You're gonna endanger our client...

1082
01:33:16,146 --> 01:33:19,149
...the nice lady who paid us in advance before she became a dog.

1083
01:33:19,358 --> 01:33:23,444
Not necessarily. There's definitely a very slim chance we'll survive.

1084
01:33:29,159 --> 01:33:32,912
I love this plan. I'm excited to be a part of it. Let's do it.

1085
01:33:33,079 --> 01:33:36,791
This job is definitely not worth 11,500 a year.

1086
01:33:40,421 --> 01:33:41,921
Hurry.

1087
01:33:43,882 --> 01:33:46,259
See you on the other side, Ray.

1088
01:33:48,511 --> 01:33:51,180
Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman.

1089
01:33:59,523 --> 01:34:01,190
Let's turn them on, Spengler!

1090
01:34:04,444 --> 01:34:06,695
Now, Spengler!

1091
01:34:11,993 --> 01:34:13,869
Get out of here!

1092
01:35:07,048 --> 01:35:08,550
Winston.

1093
01:35:09,510 --> 01:35:11,261
Are you all right?

1094
01:35:16,475 --> 01:35:17,934
Venkman?

1095
01:35:18,101 --> 01:35:19,435
Spengler!

1096
01:35:20,438 --> 01:35:21,938
Venkman!

1097
01:35:25,275 --> 01:35:26,775
Spengler.

1098
01:35:28,194 --> 01:35:31,030
Oh, Spengler. Oh, are you okay?

1099
01:35:31,198 --> 01:35:33,283
I feel like the floor of a taxicab.

1100
01:35:33,492 --> 01:35:35,618
- Venky! - Yeah, where are you?

1101
01:35:35,786 --> 01:35:38,121
Oh, thank God.

1102
01:35:39,247 --> 01:35:40,957
- You okay? - I'm all right.

1103
01:35:41,125 --> 01:35:42,583
- You all right? - I'm all right.

1104
01:35:42,752 --> 01:35:45,045
- You all right? - Yeah. You okay?

1105
01:35:45,212 --> 01:35:46,712
Fine.

1106
01:35:55,014 --> 01:35:57,974
It smells like barbecued dog hair.

1107
01:35:58,475 --> 01:36:00,435
Oh, Venkman.

1108
01:36:00,603 --> 01:36:02,811
Oh, Venkman, I'm sorry.

1109
01:36:03,521 --> 01:36:06,440
I'm sorry. I just... I just forgot.

1110
01:36:20,831 --> 01:36:22,414
Look!

1111
01:36:49,568 --> 01:36:52,362
Somebody turn on the lights!

1112
01:36:52,529 --> 01:36:55,657
- Help! Somebody! - Go check on that little guy.

1113
01:37:01,162 --> 01:37:03,081
What happened?

1114
01:37:12,298 --> 01:37:14,050
Where am I?

1115
01:37:15,886 --> 01:37:19,012
Oh, hi.

1116
01:37:19,390 --> 01:37:21,224
You'll be all right.

1117
01:37:21,725 --> 01:37:25,228
Boy, the superintendent's gonna be pissed.

1118
01:37:26,729 --> 01:37:28,648
Are you okay?

1119
01:37:29,315 --> 01:37:31,192
Who are you guys?

1120
01:37:31,359 --> 01:37:33,403
We're the Ghostbusters.

1121
01:37:36,239 --> 01:37:37,657
Who does your taxes?

1122
01:37:38,408 --> 01:37:41,536
You know, Mr. Tully, you are a most fortunate individual.

1123
01:37:41,703 --> 01:37:43,997
- I know. - You have been a participant in...

1124
01:37:44,164 --> 01:37:47,750
...the biggest interdimensional cross rip since the Tunguska blast of 1909.

1125
01:37:47,917 --> 01:37:50,086
- Felt great. - We'd like to get a sample...

1126
01:37:50,253 --> 01:37:53,131
...of your brain tissue. - Okay.

1127
01:37:56,176 --> 01:37:58,886
I love this town!

1128
01:38:42,722 --> 01:38:44,724
Egon!

1129
01:38:51,689 --> 01:38:53,608
What's going on?

1130
01:38:54,652 --> 01:38:56,985
Does anybody want to interview me?

1131
01:38:57,195 --> 01:39:00,573
I'm an eyewitness. I was up there.

1132
01:39:01,115 --> 01:39:03,283
I want to go with them in the car.
