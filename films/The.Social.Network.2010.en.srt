1
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:19,020
<i>Did you know there are more people
with genius IQs living in China</i>

2
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:21,147
<i>than there are people of any kind
living in the United States?</i>

3
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,024
<i>-That can't possibly be true.
- It is.</i>

4
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:24,150
<i>What would account forth at?</i>

5
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:27,236
Well, first, an awful lot of people
live in China, but here's my question.

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,447
How do you distinguish yourself
in a population of people

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,365
who all got 1600 on their SATs?

8
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:33,242
- I didn't know they take SATs in China.
- They don't.

9
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:35,453
I wasn't talking about China any more,
I was talking about me.

10
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,996
You got a 1600?

11
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,915
Yes. I could sing in an a cappella group,
but I can't sing.

12
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:40,208
Does that mean you actually
got nothing wrong?

13
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,585
I could row crew or invent a $25 PC.

14
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:43,920
Or you could get into a final club.

15
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:45,338
Or I get into a final club.

16
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,839
You know, from a woman's perspective,

17
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:48,799
sometimes not singing in
an a cappella group is a good thing.

18
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:49,926
This is serious.

19
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,469
On the other hand,
I do like guys who row crew.

20
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,429
Well, I can't do that.

21
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,097
I was kidding.

22
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,349
And, yes, I got nothing wrong on the test.

23
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:58,226
- Have you ever tried?
- I'm trying right now.

24
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:00,144
- To row crew?
- To get into a final club.

25
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:02,480
To row crew? No.
Are you, like, whatever, delusional?

26
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,523
Maybe it's just sometimes
you say two things at once.

27
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:06,150
I'm not sure which one
I'm supposed to be aiming at.

28
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:08,152
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

29
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:09,278
No.

30
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:11,447
Okay, well, they're bigger than me.
They're world-class athletes.

31
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,990
And a second ago,
you said you like guys who row crew

32
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:14,116
so I assumed you had met one.

33
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,204
I guess I just meant I like the idea of it.
You know, the way a girl likes cowboys.

34
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:19,789
Okay.

35
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:21,332
Should we get something to eat?

36
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,209
Would you like to talk
about something else?

37
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:26,712
No. It's just since the beginning of
the conversation about finals club,

38
00:01:26,796 --> 00:01:28,673
I think I may have missed a birthday.

39
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:32,635
There are really more people in China with
genius IQs than the entire population...

40
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:36,055
The Phoenix is the most diverse.
The Fly Club... Roosevelt punched the Porc.

41
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,223
Which one?

42
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:38,808
The Porcellian, the Porc.
It's the best of the best.

43
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:40,643
- Which Roosevelt?
- Theodore.

44
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:44,063
Is it true that they send a bus around
to pick up girls

45
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,606
who want to party with
the next Fed chairman?

46
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,401
So you can see why
it's so important to get in.

47
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:50,027
Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into?

48
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,408
- Why would you ask me that?
- I was just asking.

49
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,660
None of them. That's the point.

50
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,663
My friend Eduardo made $300,000
betting oil futures one summer

51
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,081
and Eduardo won't come close to getting in.

52
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:04,125
The ability to make money doesn't
impress anybody around here.

53
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,461
Must be nice.
He made $300,000 in a summer?

54
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:09,880
- He likes meteorology.
- You said it was oil futures.

55
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:12,174
You can read the weather,
you can predict the price of heating oil.

56
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:13,342
I think you asked me that

57
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:15,219
because you think
the final club that's easiest to get into

58
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:16,554
is the one where I'll have the best chance.

59
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,973
I... What?

60
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,599
You asked me which one was
the easiest to get into

61
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:23,185
because you think that that's the one
where I'll have the best chance.

62
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:25,771
The one that's the easiest to get into
would be the one

63
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:27,023
where anybody has the best chance.

64
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,691
You didn't ask me which one
was the best one,

65
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,234
you asked me which one
was the easiest one.

66
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,904
I was honestly just asking, okay?
I was just asking to ask.

67
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,365
- Mark, I'm not speaking in code.
- Erica.

68
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,784
You're obsessed with finals clubs.

69
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:41,245
You have finals clubs OCD
and you need to see someone about it

70
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,997
who will prescribe you
some sort of medication.

71
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,583
You don't care if the side effects
may include blindness.

72
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:48,377
Final clubs. Not "finals clubs."

73
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,173
And there's a difference between
being obsessed and being motivated.

74
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:55,092
Yes. There is.

75
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:56,844
Well, you do.
That was cryptic, so you do speak in code.

76
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,179
I didn't mean to be cryptic.

77
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,014
I'm just saying I need to do
something substantial

78
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,932
in order to get the attention of the clubs.

79
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,768
- Why?
- Because they're exclusive.

80
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,270
And fun, and they lead to a better life.

81
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:07,938
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president

82
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,940
because he was a member
of the Phoenix Club.

83
00:03:10,066 --> 00:03:12,276
He was a member of the Porcellian,
and yes, he did.

84
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,738
Well, why don't you just concentrate
on being the best you you can be?

85
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:17,365
Did you really just say that?

86
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:18,949
I was kidding.

87
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,701
Just because something's trite
doesn't make it less true.

88
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:21,869
I wanna try to be straightforward with you

89
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,205
and tell you I think you might
want to be a little more supportive.

90
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,875
If I get in, I will be taking you
to the events and the gatherings,

91
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,128
and you'll be meeting a lot of people
you wouldn't normally get to meet.

92
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:33,714
You would do that for me?

93
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:35,758
We're dating.

94
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,218
Okay.

95
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:40,471
Well, I wanna try and be
straightforward with you

96
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,390
and let you know that we're not any more.

97
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,975
- What do you mean?
- We're not dating any more. I'm sorry.

98
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,144
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not.

99
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:48,229
You're breaking up with me?

100
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,563
You're gonna introduce me to people

101
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,315
I wouldn't normally
have the chance to meet?

102
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,234
What the... What is that supposed to mean?

103
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,568
- Wait, settle down.
- What is it supposed to mean?

104
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:56,487
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here
and drink right now

105
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,322
is 'cause you used to sleep
with the door guy.

106
00:03:59,407 --> 00:04:03,077
"The door guy"? His name is Bobby.
I have not slept with the door guy.

107
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,581
The door guy is a friend of mine,
and he's a perfectly good class of people.

108
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:10,167
And what part of Long Island
are you from, Wimbledon?

109
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,503
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- I'm going back to my dorm.

110
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,921
- Is this real?
- Yes.

111
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,006
- Then wait, I apologise, okay?
- I have to go study.

112
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:17,425
- Erica?
- Yes?

113
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,760
- I'm sorry, I mean it.
- I appreciate that, but I have to go study.

114
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:22,096
Come on, you don't have to study.
Let's just talk.

115
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,431
- I can't.
- Why?

116
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:26,434
Because it is exhausting.
Dating you is like dating a StairMaster.

117
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:28,686
All I meant is that you're not likely to...
Currently...

118
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:29,937
I wasn't making a comment
on your appearance.

119
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,189
I was saying that you go to BU.
I was stating a fact, that's all,

120
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,357
and if it seemed rude, then I apologise.

121
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:34,775
- I have to go study.
- You don't have to study.

122
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:36,193
Why do you keep saying
I don't have to study?

123
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,112
'Cause you go to BU.

124
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,657
Do you want to get some food?

125
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:45,202
I am sorry you are not sufficiently
impressed with my education.

126
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,204
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat,
so we're even.

127
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:50,040
- I think we should just be friends.
- I don't want friends.

128
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,208
I was just being polite.

129
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:52,460
I have no intention
of being friends with you.

130
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:54,628
I'm under some pressure right now
from my OS class

131
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:57,298
and if we could just order some food,
I think we should...

132
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:02,052
Okay, you are probably going to be
a very successful computer person.

133
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,139
But you're gonna go through life
thinking that girls don't like you

134
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,891
because you're a nerd.

135
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,561
And I want you to know from the bottom
of my heart that that won't be true.

136
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,690
It'll be because you're an asshole.

140

00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:40,789
<i>from the individual houses
that people are in.</i>

165
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,625
<i>Let the hacking begin.</i>

166
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:00,684
<i>First up is Kirkland.</i>

167
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,771
<i>They keep everything open and allow
indexes in their Apache configuration.</i>

168
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:08,400
<i>So a little Wget magic is all that's necessary
to download the entire Kirkland Facebook.</i>

169
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,526
<i>Kids' stuff</i>

170
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,045
<i>Next is Eliot.</i>

171
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,255
<i>They're also open,
but with no indexes on Apache.</i>

172
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,381
<i>I can run an empty search</i>

173
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,842
<i>and it returns all of the images
in the database in a single page.</i>

174
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:37,221
<i>And I can save the page and Mozilla
will save all the images for me.</i>

175
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,931
<i>Excellent. Moving right along.</i>

176
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,475
Excuse me! Everybody!

177
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,978
You are at one of the oldest,
one of the most exclusive clubs,

178
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,856
not just at Harvard, but in the world.

179
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:49,233
And I want to welcome you all

180
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:52,736
to Phoenix Club's first party
of the fall semester!

181
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,538
<i>Lowell has some security.
They require a user name/password combo,</i>

182
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,791
<i>and I'm gonna go ahead and say they don't
have access to the main FAS user database,</i>

183
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,084
<i>so they have no way
of detecting an intrusion.</i>

184
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:12,005
<i>Adams has no security, but limits
the number of results to 20 a page.</i>

185
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,175
<i>All I need to do is break out the same script
I used on Lowell and we're set.</i>

186
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,762
<i>Quincy has no online Facebook.
What a sham.</i>

187
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,138
<i>Nothing I can do about that.</i>

188
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:22,641
<i>Dunster is intense.</i>

189
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,435
<i>Not only is there no public directory,
but there's no directory at all.</i>

190
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,562
<i>You have to do searches,</i>

191
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:29,231
<i>and if your search returns more
than 20 matches, nothing gets returned.</i>

192
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,567
<i>And once you do get results,
they don't link directly to the images.</i>

193
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,236
<i>They link to a PHP that redirects
or something. Weird.</i>

194
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,779
<i>This may be difficult. I'll come back later.</i>

195
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,656
- Hey, <i>Shark Week's</i> on.
- What?

196
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:40,409
- Great white, beautiful fish.
- Nice.

197
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:42,160
<i>Leverett is a little better.
They still make you search,</i>

198
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:45,372
<i>but you can do an empty search and get
links to pages with every student's picture.</i>

199
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,125
<i>It's slightly obnoxious that they
only let you view one picture at a time,</i>

200
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,086
<i>and there's no way I'm going to go
to 500 pages to download pics one at a time.</i>

201
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,548
<i>So it's definitely necessary to break out
Emacs and modify that Perl script.</i>

202
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,685
Here you go.

203
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:12,983
<i>Done.</i>

204
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,152
Hey, what's going on?

205
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,906
<i>Perfect timing. Eduardo's here
and he's going to have the key ingredient.</i>

206
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,616
- Hey, Mark.
- Wardo.

207
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,701
You and Erica split up.

208
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:23,869
How did you know that?

209
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,495
It's on your blog.

210
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,123
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

211
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,542
- I need you.
- I'm here for you.

212
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,669
No, I need the algorithm you use
to rank chess players.

213
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,005
- Are you okay?
- We're ranking girls.

214
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,384
- You mean other students.
- Yeah.

215
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,178
You think this is such a good idea?

216
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,763
- I need the algorithm.
- Mark...

217
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,681
I need the algorithm.

218
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,352
Give each girl a base rating of 1400.

219
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:52,898
At any given time Girl A has a rating R-a
and Girl B has a rating R-b.

220
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,734
When any two girls are matched up,
there's an expectation of which will win

221
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:56,944
based on their current rating, right?

222
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:00,530
Yeah. And those expectations
are expressed this way.

223
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,032
Let's write it.

224
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,632
One on the left.

225
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:20,425
The right.

226
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,927
Yeah, still the right.

227
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,845
- It works.
- Who should we send it to first?

228
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:24,972
- Dwyer.
- Neal.

229
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:28,141
- Who are you gonna send it to?
- Just a couple of people.

230
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,393
The question is,

231
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,062
who are they gonna send it to?

232
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,467
Hey, guys, check this out.

233
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,638
Someone go to the left. Dude, do left.

234
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,266
Look at these girls. Right or left?

235
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,601
- Left is hot.
- Left? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

236
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,396
Right or left?

237
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,273
That's my roommate.

238
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,275
- Oh, my God.
- The girl on the left.

239
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,361
This is pathetic.

240
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:22,487
Right.

241
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:23,780
Left.

242
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,449
- Left.
- Left?

243
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,868
Oh, shit.

244
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,037
Albright.

245
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,497
He blogged about you.

246
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:34,875
You don't wanna read it.

247
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,005
Left.

248
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,590
Latina.

249
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:42,883
Erica.

250
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,218
Is this yours?

251
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,762
I stole it from a tranny.

252
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,889
Get the hell out of here!

253
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,558
- Left.
- One on the right.

254
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,143
Left.

255
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,319
Man, that's an awful lot of traffic.

256
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,740
You think maybe we shouldn't shut it down
before we get into trouble?

257
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,792
Hello?

258
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,921
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What?

259
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:22,881
At 4:00 in the morning?

260
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:26,093
Well, there's a very unusual amount
of traffic to the switch at Kirkland.

261
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,637
You're saying it's unusual
for 4:00 in the morning?

262
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,807
No, this'd be unusual
for halftime at the Super Bowl.

263
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,850
All right.

264
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,146
I gotta go in.

265
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,273
What's going on?

266
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,984
Harvard's network is about to crash.

267
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,283
You don't think...

268
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,578
I do.

269
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,498
Go see if it's everybody's.

270
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,421
I can't connect.

271
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,383
The network's down.

272
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,136
Unless it's a coincidence, I think this is us.

273
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,679
It's not a coincidence.

274
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,639
Holy shit.

275
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,478
So you were called in front of the Ad Board.

276
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,230
That's not what happened.

277
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,940
You weren't called in front
of the Administrative Board?

278
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:25,777
No, back. I mean back at the bar
with Erica Albright. She said all that?

279
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:27,487
- Mark...
- That I said that stuff to her?

280
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:29,239
I was reading from the transcript
of her deposition.

281
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,991
Yeah, why would you even need
to depose her?

282
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,742
That's really for us to decide.

283
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:36,371
You think if I know she can make me
look like a jerk, I'll be more likely to settle.

284
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:37,873
Why don't we stretch our legs for a minute?

285
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,708
Can we do that?
It's been almost three hours.

286
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:43,461
And frankly, you did spend an awful lot
of time embarrassing Mr Zuckerberg

287
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:45,380
with the girl's testimony from the bar.

288
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,090
I'm not embarrassed,
she just made a lot of that up.

289
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:48,258
She was under oath.

290
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,719
Then I guess that would be the first time
somebody's lied under oath.

291
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:04,524
The site got 2,200 hits within two hours?

292
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:05,984
Thousand.

293
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,235
What?

294
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,197
Twenty-two thousand.

295
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,617
Wow.

296
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,886
These guys are just freakin' fast.

297
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:41,019
Is there any way to make this a fair fight?

298
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,854
Jump out and swim.

299
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,482
I think we'd have to jump out and drown.

300
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,610
Well, you could row forward
and I could row backward.

301
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,947
We're genetically identical.
Science says we'd stay in one place.

302
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,114
Just row the damn boat.

303
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:02,958
- You guys hear about this?
- What?

304
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:06,670
Two nights ago, a sophomore choked
the network from a laptop at Kirkland.

305
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,255
- Really?
- At 4:00 a.m.

306
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:09,839
How?

307
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,968
He set up a website where you vote
on the hotness of female undergrads.

308
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,886
What were we doing
that none of us heard about this?

309
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,012
I don't know.

310
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,640
A three-hour low-rate
technical row before breakfast.

311
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,183
Full course load. Studying.

312
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,560
Another three hours in the tank
and then studying.

313
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:23,853
I'm not sure how we missed it.

314
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,563
How much activity was there on this thing?

315
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,440
Twenty-two thousand page requests.

316
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,359
Twenty-two thousand?

317
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,903
Cam, this guy hacked
the Facebook of seven houses.

318
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:34,656
He set up the whole website in one night,
and he did it while he was drunk.

319
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:35,907
Twenty-two thousand?

320
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:39,411
- Well, how do you know he was drunk?
- He was blogging simultaneously.

321
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:43,164
- You know what I think?
- Way ahead of you.

322
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:44,916
This is our guy.

323
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,918
Cameron Winklevoss.

324
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:50,213
W-I-N-K-L-E-V-O-S-S.

325
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,589
"Cameron" spelled the usual way.

326
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,258
Tyler Winklevoss.

327
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,678
Tyler spelled the usual way, and my
last name is the same as my brother's.

328
00:18:56,845 --> 00:19:00,473
Mr Zuckerberg, this is
an Administrative Board hearing.

329
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,768
You're being accused
of intentionally breaching security,

330
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,270
violating copyrights,

331
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:10,650
violating individual privacy
by creating the website www.facemash.com.

332
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,528
You're also charged with
being in violation of university policy,

333
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,822
on distribution of digitised images.

334
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,950
Before we begin with our questioning,
you're allowed to make a statement.

335
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:20,243
Would you like to do so?

336
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,287
I...

337
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:28,001
You know, I've already apologised
in <i>The Crimson</i> to the ABHW,

338
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,669
to Fuerza Latina,

339
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:32,088
and to any women at Harvard
who may have been insulted,

340
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:34,424
as I take it that they were.

341
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,385
As for any charges stemming
from the breach of security,

342
00:19:37,469 --> 00:19:40,347
I believe I deserve
some recognition from this board.

343
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,476
- I'm sorry?
- Yes.

344
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:46,561
I don't understand.

345
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,687
Which part?

346
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,856
You deserve recognition?

347
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,068
I believe I've pointed out
some pretty gaping holes in your system.

348
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:55,153
- Excuse me, may I?
- Yes.

349
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,655
Mr Zuckerberg,

350
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,950
I'm in charge of security
for all computers on the Harvard network,

351
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,453
and I can assure you of its sophistication.

352
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:07,123
In fact, it was that level of sophistication
that led us to you in less than four hours.

353
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,833
- Four hours?
- Yes, sir.

354
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:09,959
That would be impressive,

355
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,378
except if you had known
what you were looking for,

356
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,254
you would have seen it
written on my dorm room window.

357
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,011
So?

358
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,430
Six months academic probation.

359
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,766
Wow. Well, they had to make
an example out of you.

360
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,434
They had my blog.

361
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,311
I shouldn't have written
that thing about the farm animals.

362
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:29,687
That was stupid.

363
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,857
But I was kidding, for God's sakes.
Doesn't anybody have a sense of humour?

364
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:35,360
- I tried to stop you.
- I know.

365
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,988
How do you do this thing where
you manage to get all girls to hate us?

366
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,990
- And why do I let you?
- I know.

367
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,576
- You can't do that.
- Wardo, I said I know.

368
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,745
Okay, let's look at a sample problem.

369
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:49,207
Suppose we're given a computer
with a 16-bit virtual address

370
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,584
and a page size of 256 bytes.

371
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:56,881
The system uses one-level page tables
that start at address hex 400.

372
00:20:57,424 --> 00:21:00,593
Maybe you want DMA on your 16-bit system.
Who knows?

373
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:04,097
The first few pages are reserved
for hardware flags, etc.

374
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:07,308
Assume page-table entries have
eight status bits.

375
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,228
The eight status bits would then be...

376
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,604
Anybody?

377
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:15,316
And I see we have our first surrender.

378
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,693
Don't worry, Mr Zuckerberg.

379
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,987
Brighter men than you
have tried and failed this class.

380
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:23,867
One valid bit, one modified bit,
one reference bit and five permission bits.

381
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:27,203
That is correct.

382
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,165
Does everybody see how he got there?

383
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,005
Mark?

384
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:40,049
- You Mark Zuckerberg?
- Yeah.

385
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,343
- Cameron Winklevoss.
- Hi.

386
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:43,470
Tyler Winklevoss.

387
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:44,929
Are you guys related?

388
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,514
- That's good.
- Funny.

389
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,057
We never heard that before.

390
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,435
So, what can I do for you?
Did I insult your girlfriends?

391
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,604
No. You didn't. Actually, I don't know.

392
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,397
- Yeah, we never asked.
- We should do that.

393
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:55,523
No.

394
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:57,567
We have an idea
we want to talk to you about.

395
00:21:58,902 --> 00:21:59,944
You got a minute?

396
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:03,072
You guys look like
you spend some time at the gym.

397
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,699
- We have to.
- Why?

398
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,201
We row crew.

399
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:09,120
- Yeah, I've got a minute.
- Great.

400
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,127
- So, you ever been inside the Porcellian?
- No.

401
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:17,837
You understand we can't take you
past the bike room,

402
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:19,005
because you're not a member.

403
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,507
I've heard.

404
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,262
- You want a sandwich or something?
- Okay.

405
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,014
- Mark, right?
- Yeah.

406
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,099
- Mark, this is Div ya Narendra, our partner.
- Hi.

407
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,018
We were really impressed with Facemash.

408
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,687
When we checked you out,
you also built CourseMatch.

409
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:35,813
I don't know CourseMatch.

410
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:38,316
You go online and see
what courses your friends are taking.

411
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,026
It's really smart, man.

412
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,279
- Mark.
- Yeah.

413
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,156
We were talking about CourseMatch.

414
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,201
It was kind of a no-brainer.

415
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,245
But you invented something
in high school, too, right?

416
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:53,748
An app for an MP3 player
that recognises your taste in music.

417
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:55,792
Anybody try to buy it?

418
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:57,460
Microsoft.

419
00:22:57,544 --> 00:22:59,629
Wow. How much?

420
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,798
Didn't sell it. Uploaded it for free.

421
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,550
- For free?
- Yeah.

422
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:04,842
Why?

423
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,264
Okay, well, we have something
that we've been working on for a while

424
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:10,431
and we think it's great.

425
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:11,766
It's called the Harvard Connection.

426
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:15,270
You create your own page.
Interests, bio, friends, pics.

427
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:17,647
And then people can go online,
see your bio, request to be your...

428
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,149
Yeah, how is that different
from MySpace or Friendster?

429
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,154
Harvard.ed...

430
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,657
Harvard.edu is the most prestigious
e-mail address in the country, man.

431
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,076
I mean, the whole site's kind of
based on the idea that girls...

432
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,078
Not to put anything indelicately, but...

433
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,913
Girls wanna go with guys
who go to Harvard.

434
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:36,291
Div ya and my brother don't have trouble
putting things indelicately.

435
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:39,877
The main difference between what we're
talking about and MySpace or Friendster,

436
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,379
or any of those other
social networking sites is...

437
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:44,215
Is exclusivity. Right?

438
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,092
- Right.
- Yeah.

439
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,635
We'd love for you to work with us, Mark.

440
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:49,429
I mean, we need a gifted programmer
who's creative.

441
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,139
And we know that
you've been taking it in the shins.

442
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:54,142
Women's groups are ready
to declare a fatwa.

443
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:56,686
But, you know, this could help
rehabilitate your image.

444
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:59,689
Wow. You would do that for me?

445
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,359
We'd like to work with you.

446
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:06,529
Our first programmer graduated
and went to work for Google.

447
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:09,198
Our second programmer
just got overwhelmed with schoolwork.

448
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:12,493
We would need you to build the site and
write the code, and we'll provide all the...

449
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:13,870
I'm in.

450
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,539
What?

451
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,541
I'm in.

452
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,043
Awesome.

453
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:21,711
That's what you said?

454
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:25,089
It was three or four years ago.
I don't know what I said.

455
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,507
When did you come to Eduardo?

456
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:28,593
I don't understand that question.

457
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:30,345
Do you remember answering
in the affirmative?

458
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,180
The affirmative?

459
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,223
When did you come to Eduardo
with the idea for Facebook?

460
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:35,933
It was called The Facebook then.

461
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,561
This doesn't need to be that difficult.

462
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,147
I'm currently in the middle
of two different lawsuits.

463
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,607
Did you answer affirmatively

464
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:45,151
when Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss
and Div ya Narendra

465
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,819
asked you to build Harvard Connection?

466
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:48,571
Did you say yes?

467
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,449
I said I'd help.

468
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:54,535
When did you approach Mr Saverin
with the idea for The Facebook?

469
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:56,120
I wouldn't say I approached him.

470
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,373
- Sy.
- You can answer the question.

471
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:00,875
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi.

472
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,335
What's that?

473
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,379
The Jewish fraternity.

474
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,048
It was Caribbean Night.

475
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,151
It's not that guys like me
are generally attracted to Asian girls.

476
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:30,154
It's that Asian girls are
generally attracted to guys like me.

477
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,281
I'm developing an algorithm
to define the connection

478
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:34,283
between Jewish guys and Asian girls.

479
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:37,370
I don't think it's that complicated.
They're hot, they're smart,

480
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:40,415
they're not Jewish, and they can't dance.

481
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:41,958
Hey, Mark's here.

482
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,251
Mark!

483
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,964
Be right back.

484
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:56,556
I think I've come up with something.

485
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,850
Hang on. I gotta tell you something
that you're not gonna believe.

486
00:25:58,975 --> 00:25:59,976
What?

487
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:02,353
I got punched by the Phoenix.

488
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:04,647
- Are you kidding?
- No.

489
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,066
I mean, it's just the first
of a four-step process,

490
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,944
but they slid the invitation
under my door tonight.

491
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,904
I go to my first punch party tomorrow.

492
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,156
So...

493
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,658
You got punched by the Phoenix.

494
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:18,453
Yeah, but, you know,
it was probably just a diversity thing.

495
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:21,038
It was just a diversity thing.
Just ride that horse until...

496
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:22,832
What did you wanna talk to me about?

497
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:24,375
- Mark?
- Yeah.

498
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,501
You said you'd come up with something.

499
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:28,212
Yeah, I think I've come up with something.
Come outside and let's talk.

500
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,589
It's 20 degrees outside.

501
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:31,841
I can't stare at that loop of Niagara Falls,

502
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:34,010
which has absolutely
nothing to do with the Caribbean.

503
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:47,148
People came to Facemash
in a stampede, right?

504
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:48,316
Yeah.

505
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:49,984
But it wasn't because
they saw pictures of hot girls.

506
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,278
You can go anywhere on the Internet
and see pictures of hot girls.

507
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,404
Yeah.

508
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:56,157
It was because they saw pictures
of girls that they knew.

509
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:58,576
People want to go on the Internet
and check out their friends,

510
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,119
so why not build a website that offers that?

511
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:03,331
Friends, pictures, profiles,
whatever you can visit.

512
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:05,208
Browse around.
Maybe it's someone you just met at a party.

513
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,418
But I'm not talking about a dating site.

514
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:12,924
I'm talking about taking the entire social
experience of college and putting it online.

515
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:15,593
- I can't feel my legs.
- I know.

516
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,220
I'm totally psyched about this, too.
But, Wardo?

517
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:18,387
Yeah?

518
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,556
"It would be exclusive."

519
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:23,643
You would have to know the people
on the site to get past your own page.

520
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:25,603
Like getting punched.

521
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:27,605
Now, that's good.

522
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,857
Wardo, it's like a final club,
except we're the president.

523
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,110
I told him I thought it sounded great.

524
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:35,238
It was a great idea.

525
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:36,364
There was nothing to hack.

526
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:39,492
People were gonna provide
their own pictures, their own information.

527
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:44,372
And people had the ability to invite,
or not invite, their friends to join.

528
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,501
See, in a world where
social structure was everything,

529
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,419
that was the thing.

530
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:52,296
It was a big project,

531
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,550
and he was going to have to write
tens of thousands of lines of code,

532
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:58,261
so I wondered why he was
coming to me and not his roommates,

533
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:01,013
Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.
They were programmers.

534
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:04,475
We're gonna need a little start-up cash
to rent the servers and get it online.

535
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:06,686
So that was why.

536
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,396
- Did he offer terms?
- Yes.

537
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,439
We'll split it, 70/30.

538
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,067
70 for me, 30 for you
for putting up the $1,000

539
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,403
and for handling everything
on the business end. You're CFO.

540
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:16,529
<i>And you said?</i>

541
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:18,239
I said, "Let's do it."

542
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,199
Okay. Did he add anything else?

543
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:21,659
Yes.

544
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,957
It probably was a diversity thing.

545
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,334
But so what?

546
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:31,794
Why do you think he said that?

547
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:34,088
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting,
but whose discovery is this?

548
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,923
Sy, if you'll let me continue
with my line of questioning.

549
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:37,091
What are you suggesting?

550
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,343
That I was jealous of Eduardo
for getting punched by the Phoenix

551
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,012
and began a plan
to screw him out of a company

552
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,805
- I hadn't even invented yet.
- Were you?

553
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:44,140
- Gretchen.
- Jealous of Eduardo?

554
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,474
Stop typing. We're off the record.

555
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:46,601
Ma'am, I know you've done your homework,

556
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,269
and so you know that money
isn't a big part of my life.

557
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,354
But at the moment,
I could buy Mount Auburn Street,

558
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:53,649
take the Phoenix Club
and turn it into my ping-pong room.

559
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:59,864
I'll let you know how the party is.

560
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:08,998
<i>We recognise that you're a plaintiff
in one suit involving Facebook,</i>

561
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:10,499
and a witness in another.

562
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,667
Yes, sir.

563
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:14,754
At any time in the weeks
prior to Mark's telling you his idea,

564
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:17,340
did he mention Tyler Winklevoss,
Cameron Winklevoss,

565
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,717
Div ya Narendra or Harvard Connection?

566
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:22,470
Yes. He said they'd asked him
to work on their site,

567
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:26,474
but that he looked at what they had
and decided it wasn't worth his time.

568
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:28,142
He said even his most pathetic friends

569
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:32,104
knew more about getting people
interested in a website than these guys.

570
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:34,106
"These guys," meaning my clients.

571
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:38,152
Yes. He resented...
Mark resented that your clients thought

572
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,655
that he needed to rehabilitate
his image after Facemash.

573
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:42,823
But Mark didn't want
to rehabilitate anything.

574
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:45,701
With Facemash, he'd hacked into
the Harvard computers,

575
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:48,412
he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad Board,
he'd gotten a lot of notoriety.

576
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:51,123
Facemash did exactly
what he wanted it to do.

577
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:53,668
Were you aware that while Mr Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

578
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,544
he was also communicating
with the plaintiffs?

579
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,797
Not at the time, I wasn't. But...

580
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,510
It really didn't have much to do
with the Winklevosses' dating site.

581
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:03,636
How would you know?
You weren't even there.

582
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,804
Ty.

583
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,224
Were you aware that while Mr Zuckerberg
was building The Facebook,

584
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,769
he was leading the plaintiffs to believe
he was building Harvard Connection?

585
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:13,312
You're offering a conclusion
not found in evidence.

586
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:16,065
We are about to find it in evidence.

587
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,734
<i>From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler Winklevoss.</i>

588
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:20,653

590
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:26,492
<i>"And it seems like it shouldn't
take too long to implement.</i>

591
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:31,288
"So we can talk about it after I get all
the basic functionality up tomorrow night."

592
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:35,793
From Mark Zuckerberg
to Cameron Winklevoss. December 1st, 2003.

593
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:39,380
<i>"Sorry I was unreachable tonight.
I just got about three of your missed calls.</i>

594
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,299
<i>"I was working on a problem set

<i>December 10, 2003.</i>

597
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,182
<i>"This week has been pretty busy
thus far with classes and work,</i>

598
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:53,394
<i>"so I think it's probably best
to postpone the meeting."</i>

599
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,604
"I'm also really busy tomorrow."

600
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:59,066
Okay, anybody else feel like
there's something up with this guy?

601
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,192
Tell him okay,

602
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:03,029
but we do have to make sure that
we meet up before we all go off for break.

603
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,365
I know, I know. Yeah, watch out.

604
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:38,522
Hey, Mark.

605
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:41,525
I need a dedicated Linux box
running Apache with a MySQL back end.

606
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,110
It's gonna cost a little more money.

607
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:45,571
- How much more?
- About 200 more.

608
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:48,157
- Do we need it?
- Gotta handle the traffic.

609
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:53,370
- Do it.
- I already did.

610
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:58,834
Hey, guess what?

611
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,171
I made the second cut.

612
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,923
That's good.

613
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:07,676
You should be proud of that right there.
Don't worry if you don't make it any further.

614
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:13,974
I'll get out of here.

615
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:16,393
<i>From Mark Zuckerberg
to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss</i>

616
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:17,520
and Div ya Narendra.

617
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,772
December 15th, 2003.

618
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,233
"I have a CS problem set
that I'm just getting started with

619
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:25,986
"and it should be about 15 hours of coding,
so I'll be busy tomorrow night."

620
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,406
"I won't really be free to meet
until next Wednesday afternoon."

621
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,617
"I have to cancel Wednesday afternoon.

622
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,870
"I've basically been in the lab
this whole time, and also I..."

623
00:32:34,995 --> 00:32:39,583
"...won't be able to do Saturday,
as I have to meet up with my parents."

624
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:48,134
As the plaque reads, this is John Harvard,
founder of Harvard University in 1638.

625
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:50,553
It's also called the Statue of Three Lies.

626
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:53,472
What are the three lies?

627
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:55,432
Mr Dowd.

628
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:57,643
The three lies. First...

629
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,853
Shit!

630
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:00,771
- Take your pants off.
- I know.

631
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:03,190
Mr Saverin.

632
00:33:03,274 --> 00:33:06,819
One, Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638.

633
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,238
Two, Harvard was not founded
by John Harvard.

634
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,865
And three, that is not John Harvard.

635
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,283
Who is it?

636
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:16,495
It's a friend of the sculptor, Daniel Chester.

637
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:18,539
Keep your jacket on.

638
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,963
Thirty-nine days after Mr Zuckerberg's
initial meeting with my clients,

639
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:29,425
and he still hadn't completed work
on Harvard Connection.

640
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:32,303
<i>But on January 11th, 2004,</i>

641
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:36,265
<i>Mr Zuckerberg registered
the domain name The Facebook</i>

642
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,143
<i>via Network Solutions.</i>

643
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:44,273
To the best of your knowledge, had he even
begun work on Harvard Connection?

644
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:47,484
Not to my knowledge. No.

645
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,908
What in the world is this?

646
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:59,121
"Hey, Cameron, I'm still a little sceptical
that we have enough functionality in the site

647
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:01,790
"to really draw the attention
and gain the critical mass necessary

648
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:04,501
"to get a site like this to run"?

649
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:06,420
"We'll speak soon"?

650
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:11,342
This is the first time
he mentioned any problem?

651
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:12,509
Yes, it was.

652
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:17,097
You sent 36 e-mails to Mr Zuckerberg
and received 16 e-mails in return,

653
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:19,767
and this was the first time
he indicated he was not happy.

654
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:20,893
That's correct.

655
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,646
He had 42 days to study our system
and get out ahead.

656
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,814
- Do you see any of your code on Facebook?
- Sy, could you...

657
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:27,441
Did I use any of your code?

658
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,360
You stole our whole goddamn idea.

659
00:34:29,443 --> 00:34:31,654
- Fellas.
- What? Match.com for Harvard guys?

660
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:32,863
Can I continue with my deposition?

661
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:36,075
You know, you really don't need
a forensics team to get to the bottom of this.

662
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:37,785
If you guys were the inventors of Facebook,

663
00:34:39,161 --> 00:34:41,163
you'd have invented Facebook.

664
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:44,541
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder
and watch you write us a cheque.

665
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:45,918
No shit.

666
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,004
Let's continue.

667
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:53,133
February 4, 2004.

668
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,888
Mark.

669
00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,807
Mark.

670
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,769
There is a girl in your art history class.
Her name is Stephanie Attis.

671
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,729
Do you happen to know
if she has a boyfriend?

672
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,400
Have you ever seen her with anyone?

673
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:14,697
And, if not, do you happen to know
if she's looking to go out with anyone?

674
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:16,073
Dustin.

675
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:21,287
People don't walk around with
a sign on them that says...

676
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:26,583
Mark?

677
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:55,446
We were supposed to meet at 9:00.

678
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:58,282
- Have you slept yet?
- I have to add something.

679
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,533
What?

680
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:12,671
Shit, that looks good.
That looks really good.

681
00:36:12,755 --> 00:36:14,214
It's clean and simple.

682
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:17,009
No Disneyland, no "live nude girls."
But watch.

683
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:20,137
What'd you write?

684
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:23,182
"Relationship Status." "interested In."

685
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:26,185
This is what drives life at college.
"Are you having sex or aren't you?"

686
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:29,563
It's why people take certain classes
and sit where they sit and do what they do.

687
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:33,525
And at its centre, you know, that's
what The Facebook is gonna be about.

688
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:35,819
People are gonna log on because
after all the cake and watermelon,

689
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:36,945
there's a chance they're actually gonna...

690
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:39,239
- Gonna get laid.
- ...meet a girl. Yes.

691
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:40,866
That is really good.

692
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:41,992
And that was it.

693
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:43,744
- What do you mean?
- It's ready.

694
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,954
- It's ready? Right now?
- Yeah. That was it.

695
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,040
And here's the masthead.

696
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:49,583
- You made a masthead.
- Yeah.

697
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:53,045
- "Eduardo Saverin, co-founder and CFO."
- Yeah.

698
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,172
You have no idea what
that's gonna mean to my father.

699
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,590
Sure I do.

700
00:36:59,093 --> 00:37:01,136
So when's it going live?

701
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,139
Right now. Get your laptop out.

702
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:06,892
What? Why do we need my laptop?

703
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:10,479
Because you got e-mails
for everybody at the Phoenix.

704
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:18,070
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool
with them that I spam their e-mails.

705
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,864
- This is not spam.
- No, I know it's not spam.

706
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:23,283
If we send it to our friends,
it's just gonna bounce around Dworkin.

707
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:24,701
I haven't gotten in yet.

708
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:27,830
These guys know people.
And I need their e-mails.

709
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:30,874
- Sure.
- Good.

710
00:37:32,126 --> 00:37:33,168
Give me the mailing list.

711
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:35,587
Jabberwock12.listserv@harvard.edu...

712
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:36,839
These guys.

713
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:37,965
Yeah, they're literary geniuses

714
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,175
because the world's most obvious
Lewis Carroll reference is in...

715
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,802
- They're not so bad.
- I'm just saying.

716
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,679
Yeah, you're right.

717
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:52,104
The site's live.

718
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:55,232
You know, let's go get a drink and celebrate.

719
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,152
I'm buying.

720
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,737
Mark.

721
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:04,908
Mark, are you praying?

722
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,883
Whatever happened to Cole Porter
and Irving Berlin?

723
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,051
It's a Valentine's Day theme.
They're playing love songs.

724
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:24,178
Good point.

725
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:27,181
'Cause Cole Porter and Irving Berlin
never wrote any love songs.

726
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,353
Honey, you should put your laptop away.

727
00:38:33,437 --> 00:38:35,397
Seven different people
spammed me the same link.

728
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:37,065
- KC.
- What is it?

729
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:38,192
I don't know.

730
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:40,027
But I'm really hoping
it's Cats That Look Like Hitler,

731
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,820
'cause I can never get enough of that.

732
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,491
No, it's not.

733
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:50,204
Div!

734
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:52,956
What?

735
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,713
This isn't mine.

736
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:01,548
Okay, what is wrong?

737
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,970
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

738
00:39:21,193 --> 00:39:22,319
Hey!

739
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,655
Hey!

740
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:25,906
Not now!

741
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,074
We need 20 minutes!

742
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:28,534
Okay.

743
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,871
I just wanted to let you know
that Zuckerberg stole our website.

744
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,124
Mark Zuckerberg?

745
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,418
He stole our website.

746
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:40,879
It's been live for more than 36 hours.

747
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:48,595
Mr Hotchkiss?
Ty, lawyer's on the phone with Dad.

748
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:51,223
Yes, sir, I'm here with my brother Tyler
and our business partner Div ya.

749
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,349
"Welcome to The Facebook.

750
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,351
"The Facebook is an online directory
that connects people

751
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:55,894
"through different social networks.

752
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:59,147
"You must have a Harvard.edu address
to register."

753
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:01,692
Yeah, I called earlier.
I'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg.

754
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,110
Yes, sir.
He's actually quoted a couple times.

755
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:04,236
I can read it to you.

756
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:07,531
"'Everyone's been talking a lot about a
universal Facebook within Harvard,' he says."

757
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:08,657
"He" meaning Mark.

758
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,701
"'I think it's kind of silly
that it would take the university

759
00:40:10,784 --> 00:40:11,910
"'a couple of years to get around to it.

760
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:14,538
"'I can do a classier job than they can
and I did it in a week."'

761
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:15,831
Tell him Div ya Narendra called.

762
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,000
- I know, that's how he talks.
- Appreciate it.

763
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,168
"As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said,

764
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:24,006
"over 650 students had registered
to use the face book.com.

765
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:27,676
"He said he anticipated that 900 students
would have joined the site by this morning."

766
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:31,013
Yeah, Div ya was just reading that 650
students signed up for it on the first day.

767
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:35,350
God, if I was a drug dealer I couldn't
give free drugs to 650 people in one day.

768
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:38,937
And this guy doesn't have three friends
to rub together to make a fourth.

769
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:40,522
All right.
Yes, that's what we'll do, Mr Hotchkiss.

770
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:42,524
We'll put all this together
and we'll e-mail it to you.

771
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,359
Well, you won't be able
to go on the website yourself.

772
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,529
Because you don't have a Harvard...

773
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:49,948
You know what, it would just be easier
for us to e-mail it to you.

774
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:51,033
I'm sure you're right.

775
00:40:51,158 --> 00:40:54,036
He's a good guy and he's very bright
and I'm sure he didn't mean to do...

776
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,203
Wow.

777
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:56,705
...what he did.

778
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,041
All right, thank you very much. And, Dad...

779
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,709
All right, love you, too.

780
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,545
- This is a good guy?
- We don't know that he's not a good guy.

781
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:04,630
We know he stole our idea.

782
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:06,131
We know he lied to our faces
for a month and a half.

783
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,383
- No, he never lied to our faces.
- Okay, he never saw our faces.

784
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:11,887
Fine, he lied to our e-mail accounts
and he gave himself a 42-day head start,

785
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,972
because he knows
what apparently you don't,

786
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:15,807
which is that getting there first
is everything.

787
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:16,892
I'm a competitive racer, Div.

788
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:20,395
I don't think you need to school me in the
importance of getting there first. Thank you.

789
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:22,814
- That was your father's lawyer?
- It was his in-house counsel.

790
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:24,816
He's gonna look at all this
and if he thinks it's appropriate

791
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,901
he'll send a cease-and-desist letter.

792
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:27,069
What's that gonna do?

793
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:28,487
What, do you wanna hire an IP lawyer
and sue him?

794
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,740
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat
the shit out of him with a hammer.

795
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:32,908
- We don't even have to do that.
- That's right.

796
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:36,328
We could do that ourselves.
I'm 6'5", 220, and there's two of me.

797
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:37,412
- I'm with this guy.
- Well, whatever.

798
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,915
I'm saying, let's calm down
until we know what we're talking about.

799
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:42,084
How much more information
are you waiting for?

800
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:45,003
We met with Mark three times,
we exchanged 52 e-mails,

801
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:46,672
we can prove that he looked at the code.

802
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:49,841
- What is that on the bottom of the page?
- It says "A Mark Zuckerberg production."

803
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:52,177
- On the home page?
- On every page.

804
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,930
Shit, I need a second to let
the classiness waft over me.

805
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:56,098
Okay, look, we don't know...

806
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,100
Cam, they wrote, "Zuckerberg said
he hoped the privacy options

807
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:00,102
"would help restore his reputation

808
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:03,188
"following student outrage
over facemash.com."

809
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:06,608
That's exactly what we said to him.
He's giving us the finger in <i>The Crimson.</i>

810
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,361
While we're waiting for Dad's lawyer
to look this stuff over,

811
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,863
we can at least get something
going in the paper so people know...

812
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:13,448
- What?
- ...that this is in dispute.

813
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,617
We're not starting a knife fight
in <i>The Crimson.</i>

814
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:17,119
And we're not suing anybody.

815
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:18,537
Why not?

816
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:22,457
I don't understand, I don't understand.
Why not?

817
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,460
He's gonna say it's stupid.

818
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:26,545
What, who, me?

819
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,130
Say it. Why not?

820
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:31,717
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.

821
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:36,138
This is Harvard, where you don't
plant stories and you don't sue people.

822
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:39,725
You thought he was gonna be
the only one who thought that was stupid?

823
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:42,477
During the time when you say
you had this idea,

824
00:42:43,145 --> 00:42:46,648
did you know Tyler and Cameron
came from a family of means?

825
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:48,817
"A family of means"?

826
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,444
Did you know their father was wealthy?

827
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:52,988
I'm not sure why you're asking me that.

828
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,323
It's not important you be sure
why I'm asking.

829
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:57,409
- It's not important to you.
- Sy.

830
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,328
Did you know that they came from money?

831
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:02,330
I had no idea whether
they came from money or not.

832
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:04,416
In one of your e-mails to Mr Narendra,

833
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:07,836
you referenced Howard Winklevoss'
consulting firm.

834
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:09,171
If you say so.

835
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:13,008
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose
assets are in the hundreds of millions.

836
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:15,343
You also knew Tyler and Cameron
were members

837
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:17,763
of a Harvard final club called the Porcellian.

838
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:19,097
They pointed that out.

839
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:21,183
- Excuse us for inviting you in.
- To the bike room.

840
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:25,270
Please. So it's safe to say you were aware
that my clients had money.

841
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:27,939
Yes.

842
00:43:28,023 --> 00:43:29,441
Let me tell you why I'm asking.

843
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:32,944
I'm wondering why, if you needed $1,000
for an Internet venture,

844
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:34,613
you didn't ask my clients for it.

845
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:37,199
They had demonstrated an interest to you
in that kind of thing.

846
00:43:37,324 --> 00:43:40,368
I went to my friend for the money because
that's who I wanted to be partners with.

847
00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:42,954
Eduardo was the president of
the Harvard Investors Association,

848
00:43:43,038 --> 00:43:44,998
and he was also my best friend.

849
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:49,461
Your best friend is suing you
for $600 million.

850
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:52,380
I didn't know that. Tell me more.

851
00:43:52,506 --> 00:43:54,716
Eduardo, what happened
after the initial launch?

852
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:57,052
I'm sorry, Sy, would you mind
addressing him as Mr Saverin?

853
00:43:57,177 --> 00:43:58,804
- Gretchen, they're best friends.
- Not any more.

854
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:00,889
Well, we already went through this on the...
Never mind.

855
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:03,642
Mr Saverin, what happened
after the initial launch?

856
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:05,143
It exploded.

857
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:07,062
Everybody on campus was using it.

858
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:10,732
"Facebook me" was a common expression
after two weeks.

859
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:12,234
And Mark?

860
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:16,154
And Mark was the biggest thing on
a campus that included 19 Nobel laureates,

861
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:20,742
15 Pulitzer Prize winners,
two future Olympians, and a movie star.

862
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:22,494
Who was the movie star?

863
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,162
Does it matter?

864
00:44:24,538 --> 00:44:25,580
No.

865
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:31,628
...at Out of Town News and picked up
that copy of <i>Popular Electronics</i> magazine

866
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:33,922
with the MITS Altair kit on the cover.

867
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:36,550
It was a beautiful day
and I was in my Radcliffe dorm room.

868
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:38,677
He brought that magazine up
and he showed it to me and he said,

869
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,639
"Look, it's gonna happen without us.
We've gotta start now."

870
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:45,892
And I said, "Okay.
Let's get BASIC out there."

871
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:49,354
Now, most of you think you know
the rest of the story, but you may not.

872
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:51,731
The beginnings of this industry
were very humble.

873
00:44:51,815 --> 00:44:56,069
That kit computer on the cover of
that magazine had an 8080 processor in it.

874
00:44:56,152 --> 00:45:00,282
Unless you paid extra for
a 1K memory board, you got 256 bytes.

875
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:04,786
So the challenge when I wrote BASIC
wasn't just to run at 4 k-bytes,

876
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:09,791
but I also had to leave room for the users
to run their programs in 4 k-bytes.

877
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:12,961
Your friend. Is that Mark Zuckerberg?

878
00:45:13,295 --> 00:45:14,337
Yeah.

879
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:16,631
- He made The Facebook.
- Yeah.

880
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:19,301
I mean, it's both of ours. We're...

881
00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:21,261
Yeah, we... Yes.

882
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:22,512
Cool.

883
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:24,264
I'm Christy Ling. This is Alice.

884
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:25,390
Hi.

885
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,684
Well, very nice to meet you.

886
00:45:28,018 --> 00:45:29,519
Facebook me when you get home.

887
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:31,146
You know, maybe we can all go out
and grab a drink.

888
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,981
Certainly.

889
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:34,983
Absolutely do that.

890
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:44,951
She said, "Facebook me
and we can all go for a drink later,"

891
00:45:45,035 --> 00:45:46,578
which is stunningly great for two reasons.

892
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:49,372
One, she said "Facebook me," right?
And then the other is, well, you know...

893
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:50,498
They wanna have drinks later.

894
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:52,208
Yes, have you ever heard
so many different good things

895
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:53,835
packed into one regular-sized sentence?

896
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,629
Excuse me, Mark?

897
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:57,255
Yeah?

898
00:45:57,339 --> 00:45:59,174
I'm Stuart Singer. I'm in your OS lab.

899
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:00,884
Sure.

900
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:03,219
- Awesome job with The Facebook.
- Awesome job.

901
00:46:03,345 --> 00:46:04,346
Thanks.

902
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:06,264
- I'm Bob.
- How you doing?

903
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:07,766
You know, I could swear
he was looking at you

904
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:11,061
when he said the next Bill Gates
could be right in this room.

905
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:12,646
I doubt it.

906
00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:15,273
And I showed up late.
I don't even know who the speaker was.

907
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:18,193
It was Bill Gates.

908
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,446
Shit, that makes sense.

909
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,366
All right. Thanks, guys.

910
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:28,578
- Are you a moron?
- Are you medically stupid?

911
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,372
You can't tell Bill Gates
is in front of you for an hour?

912
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,290
I wasn't wearing my contacts.

913
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:34,751
Can I get a Glock and kill you?

914
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:37,963
It's time to monetise the thing.

915
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:39,339
What were their names?

916
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:41,216
- Hear what I just said?
- When?

917
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,385
I said it's time to monetise the site.

918
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:45,387
What does that mean?

919
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:48,306
It means it's time for the website
to start generating revenue.

920
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:50,725
No, I know what the word means.
I'm asking how you wanna do it.

921
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,728
- Advertising.
- No.

922
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,272
Well, we got 4,000 members.

923
00:46:56,398 --> 00:46:57,524
'Cause The Facebook is cool,

924
00:46:57,607 --> 00:47:00,819
and if we start installing pop-ups
for Mountain Dew, it's not gonna be cool.

925
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:02,529
Well, I wasn't thinking Mountain Dew,
but at some point,

926
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:05,073
and I'm talking as the business end
of the company, the site...

927
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:08,368
We don't even know what it is yet.
We don't know what it is.

928
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:10,912
We don't know what it can be.
We don't know what it will be.

929
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:12,330
We know that it is cool.

930
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:14,624
That is a priceless asset I'm not giving up.

931
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,918
- So when will it be finished?
- It won't be finished.

932
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:18,712
That's the point.
The way fashion's never finished.

933
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:21,089
- What?
- Fashion. Fashion is never finished.

934
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:22,632
You're talking about fashion? Really, you?

935
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:25,301
I'm talking about the idea of it
and I'm saying that it's never finished.

936
00:47:25,427 --> 00:47:28,763
Okay. But they manage
to make money selling pants.

937
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:31,516
Mark, what is this?

938
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,059
- What?
- This.

939
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:35,437
It's called a cease-and-desist letter.
What were their names?

940
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,563
- Who?
- The girls.

941
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:37,814
When did you get this?

942
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:40,025
About 10 days ago.
Right after we launched the site.

943
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:41,943
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey, the girls. What were their names?

944
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:45,155
The Winklevoss twins are saying
that you stole their idea.

945
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,615
I find that to be a little more
than mildly annoying.

946
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:50,952
Oh, well, they find it to be
intellectual property theft.

947
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:52,245
- Look...
- Why didn't you show this to me?

948
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:53,830
It was addressed to me.

949
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:57,042
They're saying that we stole The Facebook
from Div ya Narendra and the Winklevosses.

950
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:59,169
- I know what it says.
- Did we?

951
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:00,295
Did we what?

952
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:01,963
Don't screw around with me now.
Look at me.

953
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,299
The letter says we could face legal action.

954
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,051
No, it says I could face legal action.

955
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:08,386
This is from a lawyer, Mark.
They must feel they have some grounds.

956
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:11,598
- The lawyer is their father's house counsel.
- Do they have grounds?

957
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:13,099
The grounds are
our thing is cool and popular,

958
00:48:13,183 --> 00:48:14,601
and Harvard Connection is lame.

959
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:16,936
Wardo, I didn't use any of their code,
I promise.

960
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,063
I didn't use anything.

961
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:19,981
Look, a guy who builds a nice chair
doesn't owe money

962
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:21,691
to everyone who ever
has built a chair, okay?

963
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,610
They came to me with an idea,
I had a better one.

964
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:26,404
- Why didn't you show me this letter?
- I didn't think it was a big deal.

965
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:29,908
Okay.

966
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:36,831
So if there's something wrong, if there's
ever anything wrong, you can tell me.

967
00:48:37,082 --> 00:48:39,542
I'm the guy that wants to help.
This is our thing.

968
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:43,088
Now, is there anything
that you need to tell me?

969
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:44,631
No.

970
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:49,469
What are we doing about this?

971
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:52,972
I went to a 3L at Student Legal Services
and he told me to write them back.

972
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:54,224
And what did you say?

973
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:57,435
"When we met in January,
I expressed my doubts about the site.

974
00:48:57,519 --> 00:48:59,896
"Where it stood with graphics,
how much programming was left

975
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:01,397
"that I had not anticipated."

976
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:03,733
"The lack of hardware
we had to deal with site use,

977
00:49:03,817 --> 00:49:07,070
"the lack of promotion that would go on
to successfully launch the website."

978
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:10,740
This was the first time you raised
any of those concerns, right?

979
00:49:10,824 --> 00:49:12,450
I'd raised concerns before.

980
00:49:12,534 --> 00:49:13,785
- Bullshit.
- Not to us.

981
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:17,914
Gentlemen, I'm talking about at the meeting
in January to which this letter is referring.

982
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,040
Yeah.

983
00:49:19,124 --> 00:49:21,000
Let me rephrase this.

984
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:25,755
You sent my client 16 e-mails.
In the first 15 you didn't raise any concerns.

985
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:26,923
Is that a question?

986
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:30,552
In the 16th e-mail you raised concerns
about the site's functionality.

987
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:33,388
- Were you leading them on for six weeks?
- No.

988
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:36,558
Then why didn't you raise
any of these concerns before?

989
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:38,518
- It's raining.
- I'm sorry?

990
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:39,853
It just started raining.

991
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:43,022
Mr Zuckerberg,
do I have your full attention?

992
00:49:43,857 --> 00:49:44,941
No.

993
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:47,402
Do you think I deserve it?

994
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:48,736
What?

995
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,781
Do you think I deserve your full attention?

996
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,367
I had to swear an oath
before we began this deposition

997
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,579
and I don't wanna perjure myself,
so I have a legal obligation to say no.

998
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:01,457
Okay. No.
You don't think I deserve your attention?

999
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:04,586
I think if your clients wanna sit on
my shoulders and call themselves tall,

1000
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:05,795
they have a right to give it a try,

1001
00:50:05,879 --> 00:50:09,215
but there's no requirement that I enjoy
sitting here listening to people lie.

1002
00:50:10,383 --> 00:50:12,719
You have part of my attention.
You have the minimum amount.

1003
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:16,014
The rest of my attention is
back at the offices of Facebook,

1004
00:50:16,097 --> 00:50:18,391
where my colleagues and I are doing things
that no one in this room,

1005
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:20,059
including and especially your clients,

1006
00:50:20,143 --> 00:50:23,479
are intellectually or creatively
capable of doing.

1007
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:27,275
Did I adequately answer
your condescending question?

1008
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:37,952
Well, I have 12:45.
Why don't we say that's lunch?

1009
00:50:39,746 --> 00:50:41,247
Back at 2:30.

1010
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:44,209
So what were their names?

1011
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:48,004
Their names were Christy and Alice,

1012
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:53,092
and they wanna have drinks tonight.

1013
00:50:55,303 --> 00:50:58,598
You're not supposed to be in here.
This is a men's room.

1014
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:03,811
Wow.

1015
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:19,244
Oh, my God.

1016
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:21,663
I don't care.

1017
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:44,852
Hey, man, sorry.

1018
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:47,855
A couple girls are freshening up in there.

1019
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,275
Sweet.

1020
00:51:54,696 --> 00:51:56,406
We have groupies.

1021
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:06,207
I'll be right back.

1022
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:08,084
Mark, where you going? Mark.

1023
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:14,382
Erica?

1024
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:17,343
Hi.

1025
00:52:17,427 --> 00:52:20,054
I saw you from over there.
I didn't know you came to this club a lot.

1026
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:21,848
- First time.
- Mine, too.

1027
00:52:22,515 --> 00:52:23,808
Could I talk to you alone for a second?

1028
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,269
I think I'm good right here.

1029
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:30,398
I just... I'd love to talk to you alone
if we could just go someplace.

1030
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:31,733
Right here is fine.

1031
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,527
I don't know if you heard about
this new website I launched.

1032
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:35,695
No.

1033
00:52:36,529 --> 00:52:39,282
- The Facebook?
- You called me a bitch on the Internet, Mark.

1034
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,200
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

1035
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:43,286
- On the Internet.
- That's why I came over.

1036
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:44,996
Comparing women to farm animals.

1037
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:46,956
I didn't end up doing that.

1038
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,708
It didn't stop you from writing it.

1039
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,377
As if every thought that tumbles
through your head was so clever

1040
00:52:51,461 --> 00:52:53,755
it would be a crime for it not to be shared.

1041
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,884
The Internet's not written in pencil, Mark,
it's written in ink,

1042
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:00,887
and you published that Erica Albright
was a bitch,

1043
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:05,350
right before you made some ignorant crack
about my family's name, my bra size,

1044
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:07,268
and then rated women
based on their hotness.

1045
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:10,480
- Erica, is there a problem?
- No, there's no problem.

1046
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:13,691
You write your snide bullshit
from a dark room

1047
00:53:13,775 --> 00:53:16,569
because that's what the angry do nowadays.

1048
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,614
I was nice to you. Don't torture me for it.

1049
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:21,657
If we could just go somewhere for a minute...

1050
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:23,951
I don't wanna be rude to my friends.

1051
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:25,203
Okay.

1052
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:26,454
Okay.

1053
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:30,625
Good luck with your video game.

1054
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:32,627
Hey, that was great.
That was the right thing to do.

1055
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,629
You apologised, right?

1056
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:38,633
We have to expand.

1057
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,134
Sure. Mark?

1058
00:53:42,595 --> 00:53:44,055
Is he mad about something?

1059
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:47,308
Okay, we are expanding
to Yale and Columbia.

1060
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:49,102
Dustin, I want you to share
the coding work with me.

1061
00:53:49,185 --> 00:53:50,978
Chris, you're gonna be in charge
of publicity and outreach,

1062
00:53:51,062 --> 00:53:53,272
and you could start by getting a story
in the BU student newspaper.

1063
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:54,399
It's <i>The Bridge.</i>

1064
00:53:54,482 --> 00:53:55,733
They hate doing stories about Harvard.

1065
00:53:55,817 --> 00:53:57,735
Somebody at the newspaper
will be a computer science major.

1066
00:53:57,819 --> 00:54:00,238
Tell them that Mark Zuckerberg
will do 10 hours of free programming.

1067
00:54:00,321 --> 00:54:02,031
Why do you want a story
in the BU newspaper?

1068
00:54:02,115 --> 00:54:03,324
Because I do. Now here's the arrangement.

1069
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:05,410
Eduardo is CFO
and owns 30% of the company.

1070
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:07,036
Dustin is vice president
and head of programming,

1071
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,705
and his 5% of the company
will come from my end.

1072
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:11,082
Chris is director of publicity,

1073
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:13,543
and his compensation will depend on
how much work he ends up doing.

1074
00:54:13,626 --> 00:54:14,669
Any questions?

1075
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:18,339
- Who are the girls?
- Sorry. They're Christy and Alice.

1076
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:19,715
- Hi.
- Hi.

1077
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:21,217
- Hello.
- Hi.

1078
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:23,136
Is there anything we can do?

1079
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:24,303
No, that's it.

1080
00:54:24,387 --> 00:54:26,722
- Yale and Columbia, let's go.
- And Stanford.

1081
00:54:27,432 --> 00:54:29,434
- What?
- Stanford.

1082
00:54:29,517 --> 00:54:31,727
It's time for them to see this in Palo Alto.

1083
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:38,943
You don't want any lunch?

1084
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,111
No.

1085
00:54:40,528 --> 00:54:42,196
You're welcome to some salad.

1086
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,823
No, thank you.

1087
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:51,164
This must be hard.

1088
00:54:52,707 --> 00:54:53,749
Who are you?

1089
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:56,836
I'm Marylin Delpy.
I introduced myself when we first...

1090
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:58,296
I mean, what do you do?

1091
00:54:58,379 --> 00:55:00,506
I'm a second-year associate at the firm.

1092
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:03,176
My boss wanted me to sit in
on the deposition phase.

1093
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:05,970
What are you doing?

1094
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:09,056
Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia.

1095
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,391
Bosnia.

1096
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,686
They don't have roads,
but they have Facebook.

1097
00:55:18,608 --> 00:55:21,360
You must really hate the Winklevosses.

1098
00:55:22,195 --> 00:55:23,446
I don't hate anybody.

1099
00:55:24,697 --> 00:55:27,950
The Winklevi aren't suing me
for intellectual property theft.

1100
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:30,578
They are suing me because
for the first time in their lives,

1101
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:33,080
things didn't work out the way
they were supposed to for them.

1102
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:42,215
He's expanding.

1103
00:55:42,381 --> 00:55:43,466
What?

1104
00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:44,967
He's expanding
to Yale, Columbia and Stanford.

1105
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:46,219
It's gonna be in <i>The Crimson</i> tomorrow.

1106
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:47,345
- Really?
- Yep.

1107
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:50,681
Well, looks like that cease-and-desist letter
really scared the shit out of him, huh?

1108
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:54,060
I wanna hire a lawyer to file for injunctive
relief and get the site taken down now.

1109
00:55:54,143 --> 00:55:57,104
Every minute the site is up,
Harvard Connection becomes less valuable.

1110
00:55:57,188 --> 00:55:59,982
I want an injunction. I want damages.
I want punitive relief.

1111
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:01,108
And I want him dead.

1112
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:02,276
Yeah, I want those things, too.

1113
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,653
Then why aren't we doing anything about it?

1114
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:05,029
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?

1115
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:06,822
No, it's because you're not thinking
how it's gonna look.

1116
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:07,949
How's it gonna look?

1117
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:09,242
Like my brother and I
are in skeleton costumes

1118
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:11,577
chasing the Karate Kid
around a high school gym.

1119
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:15,289
Cam, he's violated Massachusetts state law.

1120
00:56:15,373 --> 00:56:17,208
When he goes to Connecticut,
New York and California,

1121
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,626
he'll have violated federal law.

1122
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:20,503
And, by the way,
he's in violation of Harvard law.

1123
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:22,505
There's no such thing as Harvard law.

1124
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:25,091
Wait. Yeah, there is.

1125
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,514
Harvard Student Handbook.

1126
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:34,392
Every freshman is issued one of these,
and somewhere in this book it says...

1127
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:35,893
You can't steal from another student.

1128
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:39,605
This is what we needed.
We're going to Summers.

1129
00:56:39,689 --> 00:56:41,566
Well, you can't get a meeting
with Larry Summers.

1130
00:56:41,941 --> 00:56:43,484
My brother and I,
we pay tuition at this school.

1131
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:46,779
We carry a 3.9 GPA at this school.
We've won trophies for this school.

1132
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:49,323
And we'll be rowing in the Olympics
for this school.

1133
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:52,868
I want a meeting with
the goddamn president of this school.

1134
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:54,453
Why Stanford?

1135
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:56,330
Why do you think?

1136
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:01,961
I'm sorry.

1137
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:03,629
I'm late for biochem.

1138
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:06,173
Okay.

1139
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:10,428
You don't know my name, do you?

1140
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:12,263
Is it Stanford?

1141
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:14,932
I should just kick your ass.

1142
00:57:15,016 --> 00:57:17,184
How do you go to a party
and you meet someone...

1143
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:20,521
Amelia Ritter, but you prefer Amy.
You're from Orinda.

1144
00:57:20,605 --> 00:57:23,774
Your father's in commercial real estate
and your mother's 10 years sober.

1145
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:25,443
What's my major?

1146
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:27,528
- Trombone.
- Really?

1147
00:57:28,154 --> 00:57:30,031
I remember something about a trombone.

1148
00:57:33,826 --> 00:57:35,119
French.

1149
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:36,287
Your major's French.

1150
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,039
- And yours?
- Mine?

1151
00:57:38,164 --> 00:57:40,333
- I don't have one.
- You haven't declared?

1152
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:42,793
I don't go to school.

1153
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:44,712
- You're kidding.
- No.

1154
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:47,048
Well, where did you go to school?

1155
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:49,467
William Taft Elementary, for a little while.

1156
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:50,635
Seriously?

1157
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:53,638
You're not like 15 years old or anything,
are you?

1158
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:55,389
No.

1159
00:57:56,057 --> 00:57:57,141
Wait, you're not like 15, are you?

1160
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:58,351
No.

1161
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:01,562
So, what do you do?

1162
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:04,315
I'm an entrepreneur.

1163
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,901
- You're unemployed.
- I wouldn't say that.

1164
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,069
What would you say?

1165
00:58:08,194 --> 00:58:09,320
That I'm an entrepreneur.

1166
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:11,072
Well, then, what was your latest preneur?

1167
00:58:11,197 --> 00:58:15,826
Well, I founded an Internet company that
let folks download and share music for free.

1168
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,244
Kind of like Napster?

1169
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:18,746
Exactly like Napster.

1170
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:20,498
What do you mean?

1171
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:21,916
I founded Napster.

1172
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:24,001
Sean Parker founded Napster.

1173
00:58:24,085 --> 00:58:25,419
Nice to meet you.

1174
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:27,338
You're Sean Parker?

1175
00:58:27,505 --> 00:58:29,256
You see, the shoe's on the other...

1176
00:58:29,382 --> 00:58:31,425
- Foot?
- Table, which has turned.

1177
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:34,261
I just slept with Sean Parker?

1178
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:36,055
You just slept on Sean Parker.

1179
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,683
- You're a zillionaire.
- Not technically.

1180
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:40,267
What are you?

1181
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:42,603
Broke. There's not
a lot of money in free music,

1182
00:58:42,687 --> 00:58:46,023
even less when you're being sued by
everyone who's ever been to the Grammys.

1183
00:58:46,107 --> 00:58:47,608
This is blowing my mind.

1184
00:58:47,692 --> 00:58:48,693
I appreciate that.

1185
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:50,611
I gotta hop in the shower
and get ready for class.

1186
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:54,115
Biochem, even though you're
a French major whose name is Amy.

1187
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:55,866
You passed.

1188
00:58:56,242 --> 00:58:57,284
I'm a hard worker.

1189
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:02,623
There's juice or anything else you can find.
Help yourself.

1190
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:03,749
You mind if I check my e-mail?

1191
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:05,960
Yeah, go ahead.

1192
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:17,138
Amy!

1193
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:20,474
Jesus.

1194
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,893
- Amy! Can you come out here?
- Yeah?

1195
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,271
Just a second.

1196
00:59:28,274 --> 00:59:29,734
There's a snake in here, Amy.

1197
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:30,901
What?

1198
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,405
Where?

1199
00:59:34,488 --> 00:59:35,906
There isn't a snake,
but I need to ask you something.

1200
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:37,992
Are you kidding me? I could've been killed.

1201
00:59:38,117 --> 00:59:39,243
How?

1202
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:43,080
By running too fast
and getting twisted in the curtain.

1203
00:59:43,289 --> 00:59:44,832
What do you need to ask me?

1204
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:47,752
Yeah, I went to check my e-mail and
there's a website open on your computer.

1205
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:52,089
Yeah, after you passed out last night
I went on The Facebook for a little bit.

1206
00:59:52,173 --> 00:59:54,341
- What's that?
- The Facebook?

1207
00:59:54,467 --> 00:59:57,428
Stanford's had it for, like, two weeks now.

1208
00:59:57,636 --> 01:00:00,765
It's really awesome,
except it's freakishly addictive.

1209
01:00:00,848 --> 01:00:03,184
Seriously, I'm on the thing
like five times a day.

1210
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:04,769
Mind if I send myself an e-mail?

1211
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:06,353
Yeah, is everything okay?

1212
01:00:06,479 --> 01:00:08,272
Everything's great.

1213
01:00:09,023 --> 01:00:13,277
I just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg.

1214
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:18,783
I've never been in this building before.

1215
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:23,204
This building's 100 years older
than the country it's in, so do be careful.

1216
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,207
We're sitting in chairs.

1217
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:28,167
Yes.

1218
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:31,378
Very good. You can go in now.

1219
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:38,636
That's their own stupidity.
I should've been there.

1220
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:40,304
Well, darkness is the absence of light,

1221
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:43,224
and the stupidity in that instance
was the absence of me.

1222
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:45,226
Catherine, I've got students
in my office now.

1223
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:47,228
Students. Undergrads.

1224
01:00:47,812 --> 01:00:48,813
I don't know.

1225
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:51,649
From the looks of it, they want
to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise.

1226
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:52,983
All right, bye-bye.

1227
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:54,902
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

1228
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,904
I'm Cameron Winklevoss
and this is my brother, Tyler.

1229
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:59,073
And you're here because...

1230
01:01:00,533 --> 01:01:01,575
Either of you can answer.

1231
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:03,160
I'm sorry, sir,
I thought you were reading the letter.

1232
01:01:03,244 --> 01:01:04,328
I've read the letter.

1233
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:07,665
Well, we came up with an idea for
a website called Harvard Connection...

1234
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:10,918
We've since changed the name to ConnectU.
And Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea...

1235
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:12,419
I understand.

1236
01:01:12,545 --> 01:01:15,005
And I'm asking what you want me
to do about it.

1237
01:01:15,089 --> 01:01:19,009
Well, sir, in the Harvard Student Handbook,
which is distributed to each freshman,

1238
01:01:19,093 --> 01:01:21,428
under the heading "Standards of Conduct
in the Harvard Community,"

1239
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:25,182
it says the college expects all students
to be honest and forthcoming

1240
01:01:25,266 --> 01:01:27,685
in their dealings with members
in this community.

1241
01:01:27,768 --> 01:01:30,271
Students are required to respect
public and private ownership,

1242
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:32,773
and instances of theft, misappropriation or...

1243
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:34,358
- Anne?
- Yes, sir?

1244
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,277
Punch me in the face. Go ahead.

1245
01:01:39,238 --> 01:01:43,200
...or unauthorised use
will result in disciplinary action,

1246
01:01:43,284 --> 01:01:45,286
including the requirement
to withdraw from the college.

1247
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:47,454
And you memorised that
instead of doing what?

1248
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:50,958
What my brother and I came here today
to ask of you, respectfully, of course...

1249
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:54,211
Sir, it's against university rules to steal
from another student, plain and simple.

1250
01:01:54,295 --> 01:01:55,546
And you've spoken to your House Master?

1251
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,965
Yes, sir. And the House Master made
a recommendation to the Ad Board,

1252
01:01:58,090 --> 01:01:59,633
but the Ad Board won't see us.

1253
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:01,552
Have you tried dealing with
the other student directly?

1254
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:04,471
Mr Zuckerberg hasn't been responding
to any of our e-mails or phone calls

1255
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:05,639
for the last two weeks.

1256
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:07,558
He doesn't answer when
we knock on his door at Kirkland,

1257
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,476
and the closest I've come
to dealing with him face-to-face

1258
01:02:09,602 --> 01:02:11,896
is when I saw him on the quad
and chased him through Harvard Square.

1259
01:02:11,979 --> 01:02:13,063
You chased him?

1260
01:02:13,147 --> 01:02:15,733
I saw him and I know he saw me.
I went after him and then he disappeared.

1261
01:02:16,609 --> 01:02:19,904
- I don't see this as a university issue.
- Of course this is a university issue.

1262
01:02:19,987 --> 01:02:22,406
There's a code of ethics and an honour code
and he violated them both.

1263
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:25,951
You enter into a code of ethics with
the university, not with each other.

1264
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:29,997
I'm sorry, President Summers, but what
you just said makes no sense to me at all.

1265
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,248
I'm devastated by that.

1266
01:02:31,332 --> 01:02:34,001
What my brother means is, if
Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room

1267
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:36,253
and stole our computer,
that would be a university issue.

1268
01:02:36,337 --> 01:02:38,672
I really don't know.
This office doesn't handle petty larceny.

1269
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:40,090
This isn't petty larceny.

1270
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:42,343
This idea is potentially worth
millions of dollars.

1271
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:43,594
- Millions?
- Yes.

1272
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:46,263
You might just be letting
your imaginations run away with you.

1273
01:02:46,347 --> 01:02:49,183
Sir, I honestly don't think you're
in any position to make that call.

1274
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:53,520
I was the US Treasury Secretary.
I'm in some position to make that call.

1275
01:02:53,646 --> 01:02:54,939
Letting our imaginations run away with us

1276
01:02:55,022 --> 01:02:56,941
is exactly what we were told to do
in your freshman address.

1277
01:02:57,024 --> 01:03:00,027
Well, then I would suggest
that you let your imaginations

1278
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,445
run away with you on a new project.

1279
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:02,696
You would?

1280
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,198
Yes. Everyone at Harvard's
inventing something.

1281
01:03:04,323 --> 01:03:08,953
Harvard undergraduates believe that
inventing a job is better than finding a job.

1282
01:03:09,328 --> 01:03:12,790
So I'll suggest again that the two of you
come up with a new new project.

1283
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:15,960
- I'm sorry, sir, but that's not the point.
- Please, arrive at the point.

1284
01:03:16,043 --> 01:03:17,795
You don't have to be
an intellectual property expert

1285
01:03:17,878 --> 01:03:19,380
to understand the difference
between right and wrong.

1286
01:03:19,505 --> 01:03:21,298
And you're saying that I don't?

1287
01:03:21,382 --> 01:03:23,384
- Of course I'm not saying that, sir.
- I'm saying that.

1288
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:25,177
- Really?
- Sir.

1289
01:03:25,386 --> 01:03:27,304
Anne, how did they get this appointment?

1290
01:03:27,388 --> 01:03:29,306
Colleagues of their father.

1291
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:33,143
Let me tell you something,
Mr Winklevoss, Mr. Winklevoss,

1292
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:35,646
since you're on the subject
of right and wrong.

1293
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:39,984
This action, this meeting,
the two of you being here is wrong.

1294
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:43,570
It's not worthy of Harvard.
It's not what Harvard saw in you.

1295
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:46,073
You don't get special treatment.

1296
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,659
- We never asked...
- Just start another project?

1297
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:50,577
Like we're making a diorama
for a science fair?

1298
01:03:50,703 --> 01:03:52,162
If you have a problem
with that, Mr Winklevoss...

1299
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:53,330
We never asked for special treatment.

1300
01:03:53,414 --> 01:03:57,084
...the courts are always at your disposal.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

1301
01:03:57,209 --> 01:03:58,836
You can take the Harvard
Student Handbook and shove it...

1302
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:00,004
Ty.

1303
01:04:00,671 --> 01:04:02,881
Thank you very much for your time, sir.

1304
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:09,388
Whoops.

1305
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:12,099
Broke your 335-year-old doorknob.

1306
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:16,854
Eduardo, spring break, you
and Mr Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.

1307
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:19,523
- Yes.
- What was the purpose of the trip?

1308
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:23,277
Well, as CFO, I had set up some meetings
with potential advertisers.

1309
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:25,112
Who paid for the trip?

1310
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:28,282
It was paid for out of the $1,000 account
I had set up a few months earlier.

1311
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:32,202
At this point, your $1,000 was the only
money that had been put into the company?

1312
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:34,288
- Yes.
- How did you feel the meetings went?

1313
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,875
- They went terribly.
- Why?

1314
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:39,209
Mark was asleep.

1315
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:40,711
I was not asleep.

1316
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:42,129
Can I rephrase my answer?

1317
01:04:42,296 --> 01:04:44,298
I wish he'd been asleep.

1318
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:50,596
So we're in 29 schools now,
with over 75,000 members.

1319
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:52,556
People who go on The Facebook

1320
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:55,059
tend to stay on longer
than almost any other website.

1321
01:04:55,142 --> 01:04:56,894
Now, here's the most impressive statistic.

1322
01:04:56,977 --> 01:04:59,980
91% of people who try it once
will come back.

1323
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:01,940
- Now, if you'll allow me...
- Excuse me one second.

1324
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:04,401
What sound is he making? Is that like a tsk?

1325
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,073
It wasn't a tsk.

1326
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:10,574
It was...

1327
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:13,327
Like a glottal stop.

1328
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,662
Almost a gag reflex.

1329
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:18,999
Guys, what is this?

1330
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:21,752
There was one more meeting scheduled
for the New York trip.

1331
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:23,170
Yes, it was a dinner.

1332
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,671
It was set up through
my girlfriend at the time.

1333
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:27,841
Would you say that Mark was
excited about this meeting?

1334
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:30,177
Yes. Very.

1335
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,262
- Look, they're not gonna card us.
- They might.

1336
01:05:32,346 --> 01:05:34,181
- I mean, look around.
- It'll be embarrassing.

1337
01:05:34,306 --> 01:05:37,101
- Tell him they're not gonna card us.
- They're not gonna card us.

1338
01:05:37,184 --> 01:05:39,103
- Mark...
- Are you gonna talk about ads again?

1339
01:05:39,186 --> 01:05:40,938
Unless you're the ballet theatre of Hartford,

1340
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:43,023
the purpose of a business
is to make a profit.

1341
01:05:43,107 --> 01:05:44,274
It isn't a business yet.

1342
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:48,153
That's tough for me, 'cause my...
Never mind.

1343
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:52,533
He's 25 minutes late.

1344
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:55,369
He founded Napster when he was 19.
He can be late.

1345
01:05:55,494 --> 01:05:57,121
- He's not a god.
- Then what is he?

1346
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:58,705
He's 25 minutes late.

1347
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:00,040
I think Wardo's jealous.

1348
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:03,335
I honestly wasn't jealous. I was nervous.

1349
01:06:03,544 --> 01:06:04,545
Why?

1350
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:08,132
Well, I didn't know him at all, but I had
done a search and I'd asked around.

1351
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:11,510
And he struck me as kind of a...

1352
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:14,847
A wild card.

1353
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:16,056
Why?

1354
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:19,476
He crashed out of two pretty big
Internet companies in spectacular fashion,

1355
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,978
he's had a reputation with drugs...

1356
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:22,312
He also founded the companies.

1357
01:06:22,396 --> 01:06:23,730
We don't need him.

1358
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:25,399
He's here.

1359
01:06:28,569 --> 01:06:30,154
No, no, take your time.

1360
01:06:30,237 --> 01:06:32,990
- And he does own a watch.
- Stop it.

1361
01:06:34,867 --> 01:06:36,076
- I'm Sean Parker.
- How do you do?

1362
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,079
You must be Eduardo. And Christy.
And Mark.

1363
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:41,165
- Great to meet you.
- Great to meet you.

1364
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:42,749
You guys don't have anything
in front of you.

1365
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:43,917
- No.
- Tori.

1366
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:45,002
We were waiting.

1367
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:47,254
- Hey, baby boy.
- Can you bring out some things?

1368
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:50,174
The lacquered pork with that ginger con fit.
Tuna tartare?

1369
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:52,092
And the lobster claws, that'll get us started.

1370
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:54,094
Christy, what do you like to drink?

1371
01:06:55,721 --> 01:06:56,930
An appletini.

1372
01:06:57,014 --> 01:06:59,057
Great. Four of those.

1373
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:02,436
From that point on, it was a Seanathon.

1374
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:13,947
The question was,
"What did you talk about?"

1375
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:27,711
He took us through his episode
with Napster.

1376
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:30,797
I didn't wanna spend my 20s
as a professional defendant.

1377
01:07:30,923 --> 01:07:33,967
Who knew? The music industry
doesn't have a sense of humour.

1378
01:07:34,092 --> 01:07:37,304
We tried to sell the company to pay the
35 million they said we owed in royalties,

1379
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:41,892
but I guess to them that was a little like
selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas.

1380
01:07:42,601 --> 01:07:45,062
So we said screw it, declared bankruptcy.

1381
01:07:45,145 --> 01:07:47,814
- But you made a name for yourself.
- And you are dry.

1382
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:49,650
- Tori!
- No, no, I'm good.

1383
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:51,944
And then he went on to
his second business venture,

1384
01:07:52,486 --> 01:07:55,656
which was an online Rolodex that
he got thrown out of by Case Equity.

1385
01:07:55,989 --> 01:07:57,741
And I wanted to do it nice this time.

1386
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:01,745
I put on a tie and I shined my shoes,
but nobody wants to take orders from a kid.

1387
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:04,748
So let me tell you what happens to
a 20-year-old at the top of a hot dot-com.

1388
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:08,001
- I'm not a psychiatrist, but...
- I'm glad we've got that on the record.

1389
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:10,337
You're not a psychiatrist, but what?

1390
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:13,298
A psychiatrist would say
that he was paranoid.

1391
01:08:13,507 --> 01:08:15,926
They'll hire private detectives
who'll follow you day and night.

1392
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:18,095
You're a target for high-priced escorts.

1393
01:08:18,178 --> 01:08:20,514
I can't prove it,
but I know they tap my phones.

1394
01:08:20,639 --> 01:08:23,183
Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up,
you've done already.

1395
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:25,852
Private behaviour is a relic
of a time gone by.

1396
01:08:25,936 --> 01:08:28,772
And if somehow, someway, you've managed
to live your life like the Dalai Lama,

1397
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:30,023
they'll make shit up.

1398
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:32,693
Because they don't want you,
they want your idea.

1399
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:34,528
And they want you
to say "thank you" while you...

1400
01:08:34,987 --> 01:08:36,029
Excuse me.

1401
01:08:36,113 --> 01:08:37,531
...wipe your chin and walk away.

1402
01:08:37,656 --> 01:08:38,699
That's what happened to you?

1403
01:08:38,824 --> 01:08:40,367
And delusional.

1404
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:44,121
Yes. But there'll be payback at Case.

1405
01:08:44,204 --> 01:08:45,789
I brought down the record companies
with Napster

1406
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:47,207
and Case'll suffer for their sins, too.

1407
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:49,793
Sorry, you didn't bring down
the record companies.

1408
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:51,211
They won.

1409
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:53,046
- In court.
- Yeah.

1410
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:55,966
You wanna buy a Tower Records, Eduardo?

1411
01:08:58,385 --> 01:09:01,805
And he told story after story
about life in Silicon Valley,

1412
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:05,892
and parties at Stanford and down in LA,
and friends who'd become millionaires...

1413
01:09:06,018 --> 01:09:10,897
But mostly how Mark had to...
He had to come to California.

1414
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:14,151
And then he got around to The Facebook.

1415
01:09:14,234 --> 01:09:16,737
So, tell me about your progress.

1416
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:20,407
Well, we're in 29 schools now.
We got over 75,000 members.

1417
01:09:20,574 --> 01:09:22,242
- Tell me about the strategy you're using.
- Okay.

1418
01:09:22,409 --> 01:09:24,328
For instance, we wanted Baylor, in Texas,

1419
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:26,246
but Baylor already had
a social network on campus.

1420
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:27,914
So instead of going right after them,

1421
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,083
we made a list of every school
within 100 miles...

1422
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,251
You put The Facebook
on those campuses first.

1423
01:09:31,335 --> 01:09:34,171
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids saw
their friends on our site and we were in.

1424
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:35,589
It's called the Little Bighorn.
That's smart, Mark.

1425
01:09:35,714 --> 01:09:37,090
- Thanks, that was mine.
- Easy.

1426
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:38,925
Hey, you know what?
Settle an argument for us.

1427
01:09:39,051 --> 01:09:40,927
I say it's time to start making money
from The Facebook,

1428
01:09:41,053 --> 01:09:42,929
but Mark doesn't want advertising.
Who's right?

1429
01:09:43,013 --> 01:09:44,264
Well...

1430
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,183
Neither of you yet.

1431
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:48,602
The Facebook is cool,
that's what it's got going for it.

1432
01:09:48,727 --> 01:09:49,770
Yeah.

1433
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:51,521
You don't wanna ruin it with ads
because ads aren't cool.

1434
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:52,689
Exactly.

1435
01:09:52,773 --> 01:09:54,274
It's like you're throwing
the greatest party on campus

1436
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:55,609
and someone's saying
it's gotta be over by 11 :00.

1437
01:09:55,734 --> 01:09:56,777
That's exactly right.

1438
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,029
- You don't even know what the thing is yet.
- Exactly.

1439
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:02,824
How big it can get, how far it can go.
This is no time to take your chips down.

1440
01:10:02,908 --> 01:10:04,826
A million dollars isn't cool.
You know what's cool?

1441
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:05,952
You?

1442
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:10,082
"A billion dollars."

1443
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,295
And that shut everybody up.

1444
01:10:15,379 --> 01:10:18,465
And that's where you're headed.
A billion-dollar valuation.

1445
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:21,885
Unless you take bad advice, in which case
you may as well have come up with

1446
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:23,804
a chain of very successful yogurt shops.

1447
01:10:24,346 --> 01:10:28,016
When you go fishing, you can catch
a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish.

1448
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:31,395
You ever walk into a guy's den and see
a picture of him standing next to 14 trout?

1449
01:10:31,478 --> 01:10:33,313
- No, he's holding a 3,000-pound marlin.
- Yep.

1450
01:10:33,397 --> 01:10:34,481
- That's a good analogy.
- Okay.

1451
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,942
But we all know marlins don't really
weigh 3,000 pounds, right?

1452
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:38,068
Have you seen the big ones up close?

1453
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:41,113
No, but I don't think the guy's holding
a marlin the size of a Range Rover.

1454
01:10:41,196 --> 01:10:43,824
That would be a really big fish
and a very strong guy.

1455
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:45,450
You think we might be getting away
from the point?

1456
01:10:45,534 --> 01:10:49,830
I don't have a dog in this fight.
I'm just a fan who came to say hi.

1457
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:51,748
He owned Mark after that dinner.

1458
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:55,043
He picked up the cheque,
he told Mark they'd talk again soon,

1459
01:10:55,127 --> 01:10:56,211
and he was gone.

1460
01:10:56,294 --> 01:11:00,173
But not before he made his biggest
contribution to the company.

1461
01:11:02,551 --> 01:11:05,011
Drop the "The." Just "Facebook."

1462
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,139
It's cleaner.

1463
01:11:10,058 --> 01:11:11,101
Shit.

1464
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:14,855
Goodbye, sweetie.

1465
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:17,107
Yeah.

1466
01:11:20,986 --> 01:11:23,905
That's gotta be some kind of
land speed record for talking.

1467
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:26,158
You wanna end the party at 11 :00.

1468
01:11:27,117 --> 01:11:30,370
- I'm trying to pay for the party.
- There won't be a party unless it's cool.

1469
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,664
So, what do you think?

1470
01:11:32,747 --> 01:11:34,708
Yeah, sure, let's drop the "The."

1471
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,919
I meant to catching the marlin
instead of the 14 trout.

1472
01:11:38,003 --> 01:11:39,296
Doesn't that sound good?

1473
01:11:39,379 --> 01:11:41,131
If you're a trout.

1474
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:42,716
I'm going to enter this into the record.

1475
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:46,720
Incorporation papers for Facebook,
an LLC registered in Florida.

1476
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:48,889
- Why Florida?
- It's where my family lives.

1477
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:51,558
And ask the respondent to stipulate
that the articles of incorporation

1478
01:11:51,725 --> 01:11:55,395
state the ownership as follows:
65% for Mark Zuckerberg,

1479
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:58,607
30% for Eduardo Saverin
and 5% for Dustin Moskovitz.

1480
01:11:58,690 --> 01:11:59,774
Yeah, we stipulate.

1481
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:02,736
- And that was April 13th, 2004.
- You can mark it.

1482
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,446
You have anything here?

1483
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:05,822
Yes. Thank you.

1484
01:12:05,906 --> 01:12:08,617
Mr Saverin, have you ever done anything

1485
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:11,286
that might be considered
legitimate grounds for termination?

1486
01:12:13,121 --> 01:12:14,164
No.

1487
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:18,793
You never did anything to embarrass the
company or even seriously jeopardise it?

1488
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:20,795
- No.
- No?

1489
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:25,425
No.

1490
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:27,677
You were accused of animal cruelty.

1491
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:31,723
- Wait.
- You weren't?

1492
01:12:31,806 --> 01:12:34,059
This is not happening.

1493
01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:36,478
I have here an article from <i>The Crimson...</i>

1494
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:37,646
Jesus Christ.

1495
01:12:37,729 --> 01:12:38,772
I can't have this, Wardo.

1496
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:42,317
Come on, man. This is bullshit.
This is another club playing a prank.

1497
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,112
I'd gotten into the Phoenix.

1498
01:12:46,196 --> 01:12:48,823
I'd been accepted,
and as part of my initiation I had to,

1499
01:12:48,907 --> 01:12:52,911
for one week, carry with me at all times
and take care of a chicken.

1500
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:55,622
They identify you
as one of the founders of Facebook.

1501
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:57,082
"Junior Eduardo Saverin..."

1502
01:12:57,165 --> 01:12:59,125
I'm not the expert, but being connected
to torturing animals

1503
01:12:59,209 --> 01:13:00,544
is probably bad for business.

1504
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:05,465
I did not torture the chicken.
I don't torture chickens. Are you crazy?

1505
01:13:05,549 --> 01:13:09,386
No, and settle down, please.
I have here an article from <i>The Crimson...</i>

1506
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:11,263
- This is scathing.
- 956.

1507
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:14,182
I was having dinner in
the Kirkland dining hall with Mark,

1508
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:15,976
and I had the chicken with me,

1509
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:18,061
because I had to have the chicken
with me at all times.

1510
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:19,229
This was college.

1511
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,398
- Somebody's gonna have to answer for this.
- 969.

1512
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:24,025
And the dining hall
was serving chicken for dinner,

1513
01:13:24,109 --> 01:13:26,528
and I had to feed my chicken, so I...

1514
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:29,823
Well, I took little pieces of chicken
and I gave it to the chicken.

1515
01:13:30,407 --> 01:13:32,075
Someone must have seen me,
because the next thing I knew

1516
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:33,868
I was being accused of forced cannibalism.

1517
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:37,330
I didn't know you couldn't do that.

1518
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,749
I dealt with the various animal rights groups,

1519
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:42,043
I dealt with the associate dean
of the college.

1520
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,004
This was all resolved.

1521
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:45,130
988.

1522
01:13:45,213 --> 01:13:47,257
Someone from the Porc or the Fly
must have reported it.

1523
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,175
For all I know, it was the Winklevosses.

1524
01:13:49,259 --> 01:13:50,969
All right, let's just forget about it.

1525
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:54,014
This is absurd.
I'm being accused of animal cruelty.

1526
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:55,557
It's better to be accused of necrophilia.

1527
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,267
It is better to be accused of necrophilia.

1528
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:00,729
Now I have to explain this to my father.
I'm gonna have to explain this to everybody.

1529
01:14:00,812 --> 01:14:02,230
What is happening on that?

1530
01:14:02,314 --> 01:14:04,399
I have my final coming up
for Postwar and Contemporary Art

1531
01:14:04,482 --> 01:14:05,734
and I haven't been to class.

1532
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:07,068
I'm supposed to write about
these four paintings.

1533
01:14:07,444 --> 01:14:08,778
That's a Facebook page?

1534
01:14:08,862 --> 01:14:09,904
Yeah. I opened it under an alias.

1535
01:14:09,988 --> 01:14:11,406
I posted the paintings
and asked people to comment.

1536
01:14:11,489 --> 01:14:14,492
Every once in a while, I hop on
and stir the pot to get a good debate going.

1537
01:14:14,576 --> 01:14:16,995
Mr Zuckerberg was cheating
on his final exam?

1538
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:19,873
- I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen.
- And why not?

1539
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:22,709
Because I'm not suing him
for cheating on his final exam.

1540
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:25,962
- That's not what friends do.
- Well, you just told us he was cheating.

1541
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:27,922
Oops.

1542
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:32,218
You told your lawyers
I was torturing animals?

1543
01:14:32,302 --> 01:14:33,928
No, he didn't tell us about it at all.

1544
01:14:34,012 --> 01:14:36,765
Our litigators are capable
of finding a <i>Crimson</i> article.

1545
01:14:36,848 --> 01:14:39,559
In fact, when we raised the subject with him,
he defended you.

1546
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:43,063
Oops.

1547
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,523
993. We are so close.

1548
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:49,319
Yeah, that reminds me,
we're gonna need more money, Wardo.

1549
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:51,446
Yeah, no, I agree. More servers, more help.

1550
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:53,281
I'm interviewing two interns
to come to Palo Alto

1551
01:14:53,365 --> 01:14:54,449
and we're gonna have
to pay them something.

1552
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:56,493
- Sorry, what?
- I already found a house for rent

1553
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:58,328
on a street
two blocks from the Stanford campus.

1554
01:14:58,411 --> 01:14:59,746
It is perfect and it's got a pool.

1555
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,831
When did you decide to go to California
for the summer?

1556
01:15:01,915 --> 01:15:03,166
You mean when did I actually decide?

1557
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:06,419
Was it somewhere in the middle
of the Sean Parker Variety Hour?

1558
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:09,047
He was right,
California's the place we've gotta be.

1559
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:10,548
What, you're Jed Clampett?

1560
01:15:10,632 --> 01:15:12,676
I didn't know you guys
got <i>The Beverly Hillbillies</i> in Brazil.

1561
01:15:12,759 --> 01:15:14,427
Yeah, got the show in Brazil, it was genius.

1562
01:15:14,886 --> 01:15:17,847
- What is your problem with Sean?
- He doesn't bring anything to the table.

1563
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:19,974
He doesn't have money.
Dustin's a better programmer.

1564
01:15:20,058 --> 01:15:23,645
- He's got connections to VCs.
- We don't need VCs, we need advertisers.

1565
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:25,647
- And I have connections to VCs.
- No real players.

1566
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:28,316
And as somebody who's just really
embarrassed the company in a bad way...

1567
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,610
- It was the Winklevosses, Mark.
- Hang on.

1568
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:32,153
Hit "Refresh."

1569
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:35,990
150,004.

1570
01:15:36,074 --> 01:15:38,451
150,000 members, Wardo.

1571
01:15:38,827 --> 01:15:40,161
- Congratulations, dude.
- Congratulations.

1572
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:44,708
You don't think it was strange that
he was followed by private detectives?

1573
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:46,459
Who came up with nothing.

1574
01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:48,503
Enough to get him out of the company.
The drugs, the girls.

1575
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:50,714
- We don't know that any of that's true.
- You can read about it.

1576
01:15:50,797 --> 01:15:52,340
I can read about you torturing birds.
Since when...

1577
01:15:52,424 --> 01:15:56,094
Okay, don't fish eat other fish?
The marlins and the trout?

1578
01:15:58,596 --> 01:15:59,639
What's he talking about?

1579
01:15:59,723 --> 01:16:02,392
I'm interviewing interns at 10:00
tomorrow night in the CS lab.

1580
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:03,643
Get on board with this, man.

1581
01:16:03,727 --> 01:16:06,271
You know, I don't really know
what else to say.

1582
01:16:29,627 --> 01:16:32,005
You can do one more! One more!

1583
01:16:36,718 --> 01:16:37,761
Wardo!

1584
01:16:37,844 --> 01:16:39,137
Yo! Mark!

1585
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,098
What's going on?

1586
01:16:42,182 --> 01:16:44,559
They have 10 minutes to get root access
to a Python web server,

1587
01:16:44,642 --> 01:16:45,935
expose its SSL encryption,

1588
01:16:46,019 --> 01:16:47,645
and then intercept all traffic
over its secure port.

1589
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:48,813
They're hacking.

1590
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:50,940
Yes, all behind a Pix Firewall Emulator.
But here's the beauty.

1591
01:16:51,024 --> 01:16:52,859
You know I didn't understand
anything you just said, right?

1592
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:54,068
- I do know that.
- So what's the beauty?

1593
01:16:54,152 --> 01:16:56,070
Every tenth line of code written,
they have to drink a shot.

1594
01:16:56,154 --> 01:16:59,157
Hacking's supposed to be stealth,
so every time the server detects an intrusion,

1595
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,075
the candidate responsible
has to drink a shot.

1596
01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:02,869
I also have a program running
that has a pop-up window

1597
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:04,788
appear simultaneously on all five computers.

1598
01:17:04,871 --> 01:17:06,873
The last candidate to hit the window
has to drink a shot.

1599
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:09,083
Plus, every three minutes
they all have to drink a shot.

1600
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:11,628
- Three minutes!
- Drink one now!

1601
01:17:11,711 --> 01:17:15,340
Hey, can I ask, what part of the intern's job
will they need to be able to do drunk?

1602
01:17:15,423 --> 01:17:16,466
You're right.

1603
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:19,844
A more relevant test might be seeing
if they can keep a chicken alive for a week.

1604
01:17:21,638 --> 01:17:23,556
- That was mean.
- Here.

1605
01:17:23,723 --> 01:17:24,766
What is this?

1606
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:27,936
I opened a new account
and put $18,000 in it.

1607
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:31,272
Will that get you through the summer?

1608
01:17:31,356 --> 01:17:32,398
- Here!
- Mark?

1609
01:17:32,482 --> 01:17:33,900
Right here!

1610
01:17:39,072 --> 01:17:40,907
Welcome to Facebook.

1611
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:52,001
- $18,000?
- Yes.

1612
01:17:52,085 --> 01:17:54,420
In addition to the $1,000
you'd already put up.

1613
01:17:54,504 --> 01:17:57,090
- Yes.
- A total of $19,000 now.

1614
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,424
- Yes.
- Hang on.

1615
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:02,053
I'm just checking your math on that.

1616
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:04,472
Yes, I got the same thing.

1617
01:18:05,056 --> 01:18:06,140
May I continue?

1618
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:09,644
After expressing misgivings
about Mr Zuckerberg taking the company

1619
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:11,771
and moving it to California for the summer,

1620
01:18:11,855 --> 01:18:14,858
why did you put $18,000
in an account for his use?

1621
01:18:14,941 --> 01:18:18,695
I figured we were partners.
I wanted to be a team player.

1622
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:21,865
I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns
could work on the site

1623
01:18:21,948 --> 01:18:24,409
while I was generating
advertiser interest in New York.

1624
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:29,038
But mostly I figured, how much could
possibly go wrong in three months?

1625
01:18:30,832 --> 01:18:32,625
Go, go, go, go, go.

1626
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:38,840
- I didn't die.
- I know.

1627
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:40,758
- I made it.
- You did.

1628
01:18:42,176 --> 01:18:43,511
Okay, ready?

1629
01:18:43,595 --> 01:18:45,847
- That was like an 8.
- That was like a 2.

1630
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:48,308
- It was better than that.
- Yeah.

1631
01:18:56,983 --> 01:18:58,026
I'm okay.

1632
01:18:58,109 --> 01:18:59,360
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1633
01:18:59,986 --> 01:19:01,070
Yikes.

1634
01:19:02,447 --> 01:19:03,823
That's the doorbell.

1635
01:19:03,907 --> 01:19:05,116
I didn't know we had a doorbell.

1636
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:07,911
- Andrew, get the door!
- No, he's wired in.

1637
01:19:07,994 --> 01:19:09,996
That's gonna cut into your security deposit.

1638
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:13,166
- Andrew.
- Not now.

1639
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:14,584
Good boy.

1640
01:19:18,713 --> 01:19:20,048
- Sean?
- Mark?

1641
01:19:20,131 --> 01:19:22,091
- Do you live here?
- Yeah.

1642
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:23,426
Do you?

1643
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:25,053
We were right across the street.
We saw the chimney...

1644
01:19:25,136 --> 01:19:27,722
- Is anybody hurt?
- No. You live across the street?

1645
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:30,308
I'm Sharon.

1646
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:32,727
This is my... Sharon.
She lives across the street.

1647
01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:34,145
I was helping her move out,
we saw the chimney...

1648
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:36,189
We had a zip line to the pool.

1649
01:19:37,065 --> 01:19:39,525
You came to California.

1650
01:19:40,026 --> 01:19:41,027
Yeah.

1651
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,237
You made the right choice.

1652
01:19:49,202 --> 01:19:50,203
Here you go.

1653
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:55,917
Sharon?

1654
01:19:58,378 --> 01:19:59,379
I'm so sorry.

1655
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:00,505
- No problem.
- I didn't know you were gonna...

1656
01:20:00,588 --> 01:20:02,632
- Here you go.
- No, no, no. Wait!

1657
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:08,096
This house and this team are great.
It's exactly what it should be.

1658
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:10,223
I'm Sean Parker.

1659
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:11,432
Oh, he's wired in.

1660
01:20:11,975 --> 01:20:13,643
That's what I'm talking about.

1661
01:20:15,228 --> 01:20:16,354
Where's Eduardo?

1662
01:20:16,437 --> 01:20:18,940
He got an internship in New York.

1663
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:20,984
Eduardo didn't come out?

1664
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:44,298
I was crashing there for a little bit
while I'm taking care of some things,

1665
01:20:44,424 --> 01:20:47,844
but she's done for the summer
so she's back at her parents' place.

1666
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:51,389
- The homeless rock star of Palo Alto.
- All right.

1667
01:20:51,472 --> 01:20:53,933
What's your plan for the summer?

1668
01:20:55,101 --> 01:20:56,310
Mark?

1669
01:20:56,936 --> 01:20:59,105
I'm sorry. I was looking at the architecture.

1670
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:01,774
I asked what your plan for the...

1671
01:21:01,858 --> 01:21:03,359
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer.

1672
01:21:03,443 --> 01:21:05,194
- We're gonna go to the restroom.
- Okay.

1673
01:21:05,319 --> 01:21:07,321
Yeah, I'll go with you.

1674
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:12,452
Your date looks so familiar to me.

1675
01:21:12,535 --> 01:21:14,120
She looks familiar to a lot of people.

1676
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:15,455
What do you mean?

1677
01:21:17,457 --> 01:21:20,835
A Stanford MBA named Roy Raymond
wants to buy his wife some lingerie,

1678
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,755
but he's too embarrassed
to shop for it in a department store.

1679
01:21:23,838 --> 01:21:25,673
He comes up with an idea
for a high-end place

1680
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:28,092
that doesn't make you feel like a pervert.

1681
01:21:28,176 --> 01:21:32,180
He gets a $40,000 bank loan,
borrows another 40,000 from his in-laws,

1682
01:21:32,305 --> 01:21:35,266
opens a store and calls it Victoria's Secret.

1683
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:38,061
Makes a half million dollars his first year.

1684
01:21:38,144 --> 01:21:41,981
Starts a catalogue, opens three more stores,
and after five years, he sells the company

1685
01:21:42,065 --> 01:21:45,318
to Leslie Wexner and The Limited
for $4 million.

1686
01:21:45,485 --> 01:21:46,652
Happy ending, right?

1687
01:21:47,195 --> 01:21:51,449
Except two years later,
the company's worth $500 million,

1688
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:54,827
and Roy Raymond jumps off
the Golden Gate Bridge.

1689
01:21:57,038 --> 01:22:00,833
Poor guy just wanted to buy his wife
a pair of thigh-highs, you know?

1690
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:03,419
Was that a parable?

1691
01:22:04,212 --> 01:22:08,424
My date's a Victoria's Secret model.
That's why she looks familiar to you.

1692
01:22:08,508 --> 01:22:09,967
- God.
- Don't be impressed by all this.

1693
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:11,302
I read your blog.

1694
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:13,429
You know, no, that was for web cretins.

1695
01:22:13,513 --> 01:22:15,181
You know why I started Napster?

1696
01:22:16,349 --> 01:22:21,145
The girl I loved in high school was with
the co-captain of the varsity lacrosse team,

1697
01:22:21,229 --> 01:22:23,272
and I wanted to take her from him.

1698
01:22:23,356 --> 01:22:25,274
So I decided to come up with
the next big thing.

1699
01:22:25,691 --> 01:22:28,236
- I didn't know that.
- Napster wasn't a failure.

1700
01:22:28,361 --> 01:22:31,781
I changed the music industry
for better and for always.

1701
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:36,119
It may not have been good business,
but it pissed a lot of people off.

1702
01:22:36,202 --> 01:22:38,663
And isn't that what your Facemash
was about?

1703
01:22:38,746 --> 01:22:41,415
They're scared of me, pal,
and they're gonna be scared of you.

1704
01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:43,292
What the VCs want is to say,

1705
01:22:43,376 --> 01:22:46,212
"Good idea, kid,
the grown-ups will take it from here."

1706
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:48,923
But not this time. This is our time.

1707
01:22:49,382 --> 01:22:52,844
This time, you're gonna hand them
a business card that says,

1708
01:22:52,927 --> 01:22:54,637
"I'm CEO, bitch."

1709
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:57,723
That's what I want for you.

1710
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:00,059
So where the hell is Eduardo?

1711
01:23:01,227 --> 01:23:03,688
- He's in New York.
- Sucking up to ad execs.

1712
01:23:03,771 --> 01:23:05,731
- He's got an...
- An internship.

1713
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:10,403
The company's here.
A billion-dollar company's here.

1714
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:13,364
- Do you live and breathe Facebook?
- Yes.

1715
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:14,574
I know you do.

1716
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:17,743
Wardo wants to be a businessman
and for all I know he's gonna be a good one,

1717
01:23:17,827 --> 01:23:20,580
but he shouldn't be in New York
kissing Madison Avenue's ass.

1718
01:23:22,582 --> 01:23:25,751
This is a once-in-a-generation,
"holy shit" idea.

1719
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:29,755
And the water under
the Golden Gate is freezing cold.

1720
01:23:31,465 --> 01:23:35,595
Look at my face and tell me
I don't know what I'm talking about.

1721
01:23:37,305 --> 01:23:38,848
Do you ever think about that girl?

1722
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:39,974
What girl?

1723
01:23:40,099 --> 01:23:43,436
The girl from high school
with the lacrosse thing.

1724
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:45,771
No.

1725
01:23:45,855 --> 01:23:49,400
If you guys are gonna talk about bandwidth,
we need shots.

1726
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:50,985
A hundred schools
by the end of the summer?

1727
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,111
Yeah.

1728
01:23:52,195 --> 01:23:53,571
Tell you what. Gesture of good faith.

1729
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:58,117
While you're getting into 100 schools,
I'll put you on two continents.

1730
01:23:59,285 --> 01:24:00,369
Two...

1731
01:24:04,832 --> 01:24:06,292
If you don't have a place to crash,

1732
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:08,669
I think you should definitely
come and live with us.

1733
01:24:09,629 --> 01:24:11,547
Let's line up some shots.

1734
01:24:11,631 --> 01:24:13,758
- Excuse me!
- Yes, sir.

1735
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:16,969
You can take this away
and bring back the 1942.

1736
01:24:17,053 --> 01:24:18,971
Absolutely, Mr Parker.

1737
01:24:35,154 --> 01:24:38,157
Attention... Go!

1738
01:24:55,007 --> 01:24:59,512
<i>At the barrier, Hollandia is
leading Harvard University by one length.</i>

1739
01:25:09,355 --> 01:25:10,523
<i>Approaching the grandstands,</i>

1740
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:13,734
<i>Hollandia maintains a lead
of three-quarters of a length.</i>

1741
01:25:26,956 --> 01:25:28,207
Come on!

1742
01:26:06,871 --> 01:26:08,205
Whatever.

1743
01:26:13,878 --> 01:26:14,920
- Mr Winklevoss.
- Tyler.

1744
01:26:15,046 --> 01:26:16,881
- Tremendous race.
- Thank you.

1745
01:26:16,964 --> 01:26:19,216
- And this is my brother, Cameron.
- Excellent.

1746
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:20,343
Sir?

1747
01:26:20,426 --> 01:26:22,136
His Royal Highness Prince Albert.

1748
01:26:22,261 --> 01:26:24,013
Your Highness, this is
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

1749
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:27,433
Of course. Brilliant race.
I've never seen a race that close.

1750
01:26:27,558 --> 01:26:28,559
Yes, Your Highness.

1751
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:31,687
My grandfather, Jack Kelly,
was one of the premier rowers of his day.

1752
01:26:31,771 --> 01:26:35,232
I've been coming to Henley for 30 years
and I'd never seen a race that close.

1753
01:26:35,608 --> 01:26:37,234
Have you? Have you seen a race that close?

1754
01:26:37,318 --> 01:26:38,402
No, Your Highness.

1755
01:26:38,486 --> 01:26:40,863
Mile-and-a-half races are more
commonly won by a boat length or two.

1756
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:43,741
Yes, that's absolutely right. Brutally close.

1757
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:44,992
May I introduce my teammates?

1758
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:47,036
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse us.

1759
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:48,788
On to the Dutch.

1760
01:26:52,291 --> 01:26:53,667
Sorry you flew all the way out here
to see that.

1761
01:26:53,793 --> 01:26:55,920
Wouldn't have missed it, brother.
How was the royalty?

1762
01:26:56,003 --> 01:26:58,631
I just wanted him to tell me
a couple more times how close the race was.

1763
01:26:58,756 --> 01:27:02,259
Just brutal, brutally close.
Brutally excruciating. Jesus.

1764
01:27:02,343 --> 01:27:04,011
The guy is the prince of a country
the size of Nantucket.

1765
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:05,137
Relax, it's fine.

1766
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:06,430
- Boys. Div ya.
- Dad.

1767
01:27:06,514 --> 01:27:08,557
- Mr Winklevoss.
- That was a tough beat.

1768
01:27:08,641 --> 01:27:10,726
I'm sorry that you and Mom
had to fly out here to see that.

1769
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:12,645
No, don't ever apologise to me
for losing a race like that.

1770
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:15,648
Don't ever apologise to anyone
for losing a race like that.

1771
01:27:15,773 --> 01:27:17,608
- Boys.
- Mr Kenwright.

1772
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:20,945
Dad, this is Mr Kenwright,
head of the host family for this week.

1773
01:27:21,028 --> 01:27:22,780
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

1774
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:24,281
I've just had a phone chat with my daughter.

1775
01:27:24,365 --> 01:27:27,326
She told me that she and her friends
are already talking about the race,

1776
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:29,703
which they've just seen via their computers.

1777
01:27:29,829 --> 01:27:33,666
A new website called Facebook.
Do you have this in America?

1778
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,169
I'm gonna find your mother.

1779
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:39,755
Have I said something wrong?

1780
01:27:39,839 --> 01:27:41,715
Your daughter doesn't go
to school in the States?

1781
01:27:41,841 --> 01:27:43,134
No, no. Cambridge.

1782
01:27:43,217 --> 01:27:45,970
Majoring in French literature, though
I wasn't aware there was such a thing.

1783
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:47,138
And they have Facebook at Cambridge?

1784
01:27:47,221 --> 01:27:49,306
And apparently Oxford and
the London School of Economics.

1785
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:50,474
That's where her friends are.

1786
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:52,560
That's awesome.

1787
01:27:53,018 --> 01:27:56,522
Good race, boys.
Take the bitter with the better, eh?

1788
01:27:58,858 --> 01:28:00,234
I'm gonna go watch the race film.

1789
01:28:03,571 --> 01:28:05,865
If this is online, I wanna see it.

1790
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:07,324
Stop it.

1791
01:28:07,867 --> 01:28:09,368
Stop it, Cam.

1792
01:28:09,743 --> 01:28:11,245
Knock it off.

1793
01:28:11,829 --> 01:28:14,373
I don't mind that we lost
to the Dutch today by less than a second.

1794
01:28:14,498 --> 01:28:16,667
That was a good race,
and that was a fair race.

1795
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,210
And they'll see us again.

1796
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:20,463
What I mind, and what you should mind,

1797
01:28:20,546 --> 01:28:23,716
is showing up on Monday
for a race that was run on Sunday.

1798
01:28:24,258 --> 01:28:26,177
We tried talking to him ourselves,
we tried writing a letter,

1799
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:29,847
we tried the Ad Board, and we tried
talking to the president of the university.

1800
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:32,433
Now, I am asking you for the last time,

1801
01:28:32,558 --> 01:28:37,730
let's take the considerable resources
at our disposal and sue him in federal court.

1802
01:28:38,189 --> 01:28:39,440
Come on.

1803
01:28:40,858 --> 01:28:42,693
I need a real drink.

1804
01:28:49,575 --> 01:28:50,576
Screw it.

1805
01:28:52,036 --> 01:28:54,246
Let's gut the friggin' nerd.

1806
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:58,417
That's what I'm talking about!

1807
01:28:58,584 --> 01:29:00,419
No, no, no, no, no.

1808
01:29:00,586 --> 01:29:02,838
But check it out, I saw him today.

1809
01:29:02,922 --> 01:29:05,341
Manningham, Mitchell Manningham,
my Case Equity guy.

1810
01:29:05,424 --> 01:29:06,509
Hang on.

1811
01:29:06,592 --> 01:29:08,260
Are you guys using Spikes
or Ghost Missiles?

1812
01:29:08,344 --> 01:29:10,012
We don't know,
we're just shooting at each other.

1813
01:29:10,095 --> 01:29:11,514
Use Sweet Kamikazes.

1814
01:29:11,597 --> 01:29:13,724
Like we know what that is.

1815
01:29:14,225 --> 01:29:18,020
I saw him getting into his Turbo Carrera
and he saw me, too.

1816
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:19,688
I know he did.

1817
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:25,069
Don't. Don't sweat it. I'm on a landline.

1818
01:29:25,236 --> 01:29:26,570
Bong hit.

1819
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:28,781
Does anybody hear that banging?

1820
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:31,283
You don't hear anything.
You're writing code.

1821
01:29:31,367 --> 01:29:33,369
Dude, somebody's at the door.

1822
01:29:33,452 --> 01:29:38,040
It's not a dish best served cold.
It's best served immediately and relentlessly.

1823
01:29:41,752 --> 01:29:43,587
I'm gonna call you back.

1824
01:29:45,589 --> 01:29:46,632
What's up?

1825
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:48,092
What's up?

1826
01:29:49,802 --> 01:29:51,554
Mark was supposed to pick me up
at the airport an hour ago.

1827
01:29:51,637 --> 01:29:53,222
I've been calling his cell.

1828
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:57,810
He was on a 36-hour coding tear,
so he took a nap for a couple of hours.

1829
01:30:04,066 --> 01:30:05,150
What happened here?

1830
01:30:05,276 --> 01:30:08,737
Not happened. Happening.
The next big thing.

1831
01:30:08,821 --> 01:30:09,989
Wardo.

1832
01:30:10,072 --> 01:30:11,073
Hey, man.

1833
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:13,158
- Back to work.
- Okay.

1834
01:30:13,242 --> 01:30:16,161
The more bad I get at this,
the more wasted I get.

1835
01:30:16,287 --> 01:30:17,788
I mean the more wasted that I get...

1836
01:30:18,163 --> 01:30:19,582
We understand.

1837
01:30:21,959 --> 01:30:23,085
How old are they, Sean?

1838
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:25,004
It's not polite to ask.

1839
01:30:25,087 --> 01:30:26,255
Sean, how old are they?

1840
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:28,841
You think you know me, right?

1841
01:30:28,966 --> 01:30:30,175
I've read enough.

1842
01:30:30,301 --> 01:30:32,636
You know how much I've read about you?

1843
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:34,513
Nothing.

1844
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:40,102
- Wardo.
- Hey, man.

1845
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:43,105
- I waited an hour for you at the airport.
- What time is it?

1846
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:46,525
It's midnight. Or 3:00 a.m. in New York,
where I just came from.

1847
01:30:46,609 --> 01:30:50,279
You gotta see some of the new stuff we got.
Hey, Dustin. Show him the Wall.

1848
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:51,447
I'm just calling it the Wall.

1849
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:54,116
Forget the Wall, tell him about
the meeting I've got set up.

1850
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:55,784
You know Peter Thiel?

1851
01:30:55,868 --> 01:30:57,202
- Nope.
- No reason you should.

1852
01:30:57,286 --> 01:31:00,539
He just runs a $2-billion hedge fund
called Clarium Capital.

1853
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:03,626
Why's he setting up meetings?

1854
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:04,793
Thiel might wanna make
an angel investment.

1855
01:31:04,877 --> 01:31:07,963
I don't care if he's an actual angel.
Why is he setting up business meetings?

1856
01:31:08,047 --> 01:31:10,716
- You've had a long flight.
- No, I had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK,

1857
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:13,052
then a long wait at the passenger
loading and unloading zone at SFO,

1858
01:31:13,177 --> 01:31:15,054
and in between there was a long flight.

1859
01:31:15,179 --> 01:31:16,889
I'm the business end of this company.

1860
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:20,059
And he is a house guest living here rent free

1861
01:31:20,184 --> 01:31:23,062
on a very generous grant
from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.

1862
01:31:23,187 --> 01:31:26,482
I heard about your big-ticket ad buys.
Gary's Tuxedos.

1863
01:31:26,565 --> 01:31:28,233
- Hey, man...
- Harvard Bartending Course.

1864
01:31:28,317 --> 01:31:31,528
You're just a small step away
from bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it.

1865
01:31:40,704 --> 01:31:42,998
- You wanna talk to me alone for a minute?
- Sure.

1866
01:31:47,336 --> 01:31:48,671
Bong hit.

1867
01:31:48,754 --> 01:31:51,048
- I'm so high.
- No, you're not.

1868
01:31:51,590 --> 01:31:53,342
So how's it going?

1869
01:31:53,676 --> 01:31:56,345
How's the internship? How's Christy?

1870
01:31:57,346 --> 01:31:59,682
- How's the internship?
- Yeah.

1871
01:32:01,225 --> 01:32:03,185
Mark, Jesus, I quit the internship.

1872
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:05,771
We talked about this on the phone.
I quit on my first day.

1873
01:32:07,398 --> 01:32:09,775
I do remember you saying that.

1874
01:32:09,942 --> 01:32:11,735
So how is Christy?

1875
01:32:12,111 --> 01:32:13,779
Christy's crazy.

1876
01:32:14,071 --> 01:32:15,781
- Is that fun?
- No.

1877
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:16,865
I mean, she's actually psychotic.

1878
01:32:16,949 --> 01:32:22,121
She's insanely jealous, she's irrational,
and I'm frightened of her.

1879
01:32:22,788 --> 01:32:24,081
Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend.

1880
01:32:27,626 --> 01:32:31,714
I do not want that guy representing
himself as part of this company.

1881
01:32:31,797 --> 01:32:33,966
You gotta move out here, Wardo,
this is where it's all happening.

1882
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:36,051
- Did you hear what I just said?
- The connections, the energy...

1883
01:32:36,135 --> 01:32:37,136
Mark, you got...

1884
01:32:37,261 --> 01:32:39,805
I'm afraid if you don't come out here,
you're gonna get left behind.

1885
01:32:39,888 --> 01:32:42,224
I want... I need you out here.

1886
01:32:42,307 --> 01:32:44,226
- Please don't tell him I said that.
- What did you just say?

1887
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:46,395
It's moving faster than any of us
ever imagined it would.

1888
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:48,230
- It's moving fast.
- What did you mean?

1889
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:50,232
- And Sean thinks we have...
- Sean is not part of this company.

1890
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:51,400
We have over 300,000 members, Wardo,

1891
01:32:51,483 --> 01:32:53,652
and we're in 160 schools,
including five in Europe.

1892
01:32:53,736 --> 01:32:55,237
I'm aware of that! Mark, I am the CFO!

1893
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,739
We need more servers
than I ever expected we'd need.

1894
01:32:56,822 --> 01:32:58,407
We need more programmers
and we need more money,

1895
01:32:58,490 --> 01:33:00,993
and he set up the Thiel meeting.
He set up meetings all over town.

1896
01:33:01,118 --> 01:33:02,327
- He set up other meetings?
- Yes.

1897
01:33:02,411 --> 01:33:04,163
- Without me knowing anything about it.
- You're in New York.

1898
01:33:04,288 --> 01:33:08,167
I'm in New York riding subways
14 hours a day, trying to find advertisers!

1899
01:33:08,292 --> 01:33:09,960
And how's it going so far?

1900
01:33:14,423 --> 01:33:17,009
What did you mean, "get left behind"?

1901
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:23,015
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

1902
01:33:23,098 --> 01:33:24,600
I'd like to freeze this bank account

1903
01:33:24,683 --> 01:33:28,145
and cancel all existing cheques
and lines of credit.

1904
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:32,649
- May I see some ID, please?
- Yeah, sure, sorry.

1905
01:33:39,448 --> 01:33:40,699
Sean, he'll be right with you.

1906
01:33:40,783 --> 01:33:42,201
No problem.

1907
01:33:44,036 --> 01:33:46,288
You know this is where
they filmed <i>Towering Inferno?</i>

1908
01:33:46,371 --> 01:33:48,123
That's comforting.

1909
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:51,293
Hey, guys. Come on back.

1910
01:33:52,795 --> 01:33:55,047
- She offer you some waters?
- Oh, yeah. We're cool.

1911
01:33:56,632 --> 01:33:57,883
Sean, how are you? Come on in.

1912
01:33:57,966 --> 01:33:59,885
- You must be Mark.
- Hi.

1913
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:05,015
We took a look at everything,
and congratulations.

1914
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:08,644
We're gonna start you off
with a $500,000 investment.

1915
01:34:09,061 --> 01:34:12,731
Maurice is gonna talk to you
about some corporate restructuring.

1916
01:34:12,856 --> 01:34:14,900
We'll file as a corporation in Delaware

1917
01:34:14,983 --> 01:34:17,903
and come up with a stock structure
that allows for new investors.

1918
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:20,322
Now, let me ask you something.

1919
01:34:20,489 --> 01:34:22,407
Who's Eduardo Saverin?

1920
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:44,012
Jesus Christ.

1921
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:48,684
When did you get back?

1922
01:34:48,767 --> 01:34:50,185
You scared me. I need you to knock.

1923
01:34:50,269 --> 01:34:52,187
When did you get back?

1924
01:34:53,272 --> 01:34:54,940
I got back this afternoon.

1925
01:34:55,065 --> 01:34:56,525
And when were you gonna call me?

1926
01:34:56,608 --> 01:34:59,278
Chris, it was kind of a rough trip
and I was tired...

1927
01:34:59,361 --> 01:35:03,282
Yeah, or answer one of my 47 texts.
Did you know I sent 47 texts?

1928
01:35:03,365 --> 01:35:07,244
I did, and I thought that was
incredibly normal behaviour.

1929
01:35:07,369 --> 01:35:08,871
Are you mocking me?

1930
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:10,289
I brought you a present.

1931
01:35:12,124 --> 01:35:14,960
Why does your Status say "single"
on your Facebook page?

1932
01:35:15,085 --> 01:35:16,128
What?

1933
01:35:16,211 --> 01:35:20,132
Why does your Relationship Status
say "single" on your Facebook page?

1934
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:21,884
Well, I was single when I set up the page.

1935
01:35:21,967 --> 01:35:24,052
And you just never bothered to change it?

1936
01:35:24,136 --> 01:35:25,220
What?

1937
01:35:25,429 --> 01:35:26,889
I don't know how.

1938
01:35:26,972 --> 01:35:28,807
Do I look stupid to you?

1939
01:35:28,932 --> 01:35:30,225
No, calm down.

1940
01:35:30,309 --> 01:35:32,561
You're asking me to believe
that the CFO of Facebook

1941
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:34,897
doesn't know how to change
his Relationship Status on Facebook?

1942
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:38,317
It's embarrassing, so you should take it
as a sign of trust that I would tell you that.

1943
01:35:38,442 --> 01:35:39,651
- Go to hell.
- Take it easy.

1944
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:42,821
No, you didn't change it so you could
screw those Silicon Valley sluts

1945
01:35:42,905 --> 01:35:44,072
every time you go out to see Mark.

1946
01:35:44,156 --> 01:35:47,159
Not even remotely true, and I can
promise you that the Silicon Valley sluts

1947
01:35:47,284 --> 01:35:50,162
don't care what anyone's
Relationship Status is on Facebook.

1948
01:35:50,287 --> 01:35:51,663
Please, open your present.

1949
01:35:51,788 --> 01:35:53,665
Your phone does work.

1950
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:55,751
It's Mark.

1951
01:35:55,834 --> 01:35:58,003
Okay, this is gonna be tricky.

1952
01:35:58,086 --> 01:36:00,589
Open your present. It's a silk scarf.

1953
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:02,341
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

1954
01:36:02,758 --> 01:36:04,593
This'll be your first.

1955
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:05,761
Yeah.

1956
01:36:05,844 --> 01:36:07,095
- <i>You froze our account?</i>
- I did.

1957
01:36:07,179 --> 01:36:09,431
- You froze the account.
- I had to get your attention, Mark.

1958
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:11,266
Do you realise that you jeopardised
the entire company?

1959
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:12,935
Do you realise that your actions
could have destroyed

1960
01:36:13,018 --> 01:36:14,019
everything I've been working on?

1961
01:36:14,144 --> 01:36:15,187
We have been working on.

1962
01:36:15,270 --> 01:36:16,772
Without money, the site can't function.

1963
01:36:16,855 --> 01:36:19,107
Let me tell you the difference
between Facebook and everybody else.

1964
01:36:19,191 --> 01:36:20,275
We don't crash ever!

1965
01:36:20,359 --> 01:36:24,029
If the servers are down for even a day, our
entire reputation is irreversibly destroyed.

1966
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:26,114
- Look...
- <i>Users are fickle. Friendster has proved that.</i>

1967
01:36:26,198 --> 01:36:28,951
<i>Even a few people leaving would reverberate
through the entire user base.</i>

1968
01:36:29,034 --> 01:36:31,370
The users are interconnected.
That is the whole point.

1969
01:36:31,453 --> 01:36:33,205
College kids are online
because their friends are online

1970
01:36:33,288 --> 01:36:35,457
and if one domino goes,
the other dominos go.

1971
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:36,625
Don't you get that?

1972
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:38,335
I am not going back to
the Caribbean Night at A-E-Pi!

1973
01:36:40,337 --> 01:36:41,713
Holy shit.

1974
01:36:44,549 --> 01:36:45,884
What is wrong with you?

1975
01:36:46,009 --> 01:36:47,469
Did you like being nobody?

1976
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:49,304
Did you like being a joke?
Do you wanna go back to that?

1977
01:36:49,388 --> 01:36:50,806
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

1978
01:36:50,889 --> 01:36:52,224
<i>That was the act of a child,
not a businessman,</i>

1979
01:36:52,307 --> 01:36:53,725
<i>and it certainly was not the act of a friend.</i>

1980
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:56,395
You know how embarrassing it was for me
to try to cash a cheque today?

1981
01:36:56,478 --> 01:36:57,729
I am not going back to that life.

1982
01:36:57,854 --> 01:37:00,232
- <i>Maybe you were frustrated.</i>
- Yeah!

1983
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:02,693
- Maybe you were angry.
- I was!

1984
01:37:02,901 --> 01:37:05,237
But I am willing to let bygones be bygones,

1985
01:37:05,362 --> 01:37:07,656
<i>because, Wardo, I've got some good news.</i>

1986
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:08,907
I'm sorry.

1987
01:37:08,991 --> 01:37:13,745
I was angry, and maybe it was childish,
but I had to get your attention.

1988
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:16,665
Wardo, I said I've got some good news.

1989
01:37:17,082 --> 01:37:18,083
What is it?

1990
01:37:18,208 --> 01:37:20,752
Peter Thiel just made an angel investment
of half a million dollars.

1991
01:37:20,836 --> 01:37:22,004
What?

1992
01:37:22,212 --> 01:37:26,174
<i>Haifa million dollars.
And he's setting us up in an office.</i>

1993
01:37:26,925 --> 01:37:29,428
They wanna reincorporate the company.
They wanna meet you.

1994
01:37:29,553 --> 01:37:31,013
They need your signature
on some documents,

1995
01:37:31,096 --> 01:37:33,515
so you gotta get your ass
on the first flight back to San Francisco.

1996
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:35,183
<i>I need my CFO.</i>

1997
01:37:40,105 --> 01:37:41,189
I'm on my way.

1998
01:37:41,273 --> 01:37:42,774
- <i>Wardo?</i>
- Yeah?

1999
01:37:42,941 --> 01:37:44,401
We did it.

2000
01:37:47,738 --> 01:37:48,947
Wardo?

2001
01:37:49,531 --> 01:37:51,450
You're going back there already?

2002
01:37:51,575 --> 01:37:52,701
Yes.

2003
01:37:54,453 --> 01:37:56,621
And also, I'm breaking up with you.

2004
01:38:00,459 --> 01:38:02,252
Somebody stop her!

2005
01:38:04,755 --> 01:38:05,797
Four documents.

2006
01:38:05,922 --> 01:38:07,799
The first two are common stock
purchase agreements,

2007
01:38:07,924 --> 01:38:10,969
allowing you to buy stock
in the newly reincorporated Facebook,

2008
01:38:11,053 --> 01:38:14,473
as opposed to the old shares,
which are now worthless.

2009
01:38:14,556 --> 01:38:15,724
The third is an exchange agreement

2010
01:38:15,807 --> 01:38:18,560
allowing you to exchange
the old shares for new shares,

2011
01:38:18,643 --> 01:38:20,896
and then finally a voter holding agreement.

2012
01:38:20,979 --> 01:38:22,731
How many shares of stock will I own?

2013
01:38:22,814 --> 01:38:25,984
1,328,334.

2014
01:38:26,068 --> 01:38:27,444
Jesus Christ.

2015
01:38:27,527 --> 01:38:30,447
That represents a 34.4% ownership share.

2016
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:33,283
Why the increase from the original 30%?

2017
01:38:33,366 --> 01:38:36,119
'Cause you may need to dilute it
to award shares to new investors.

2018
01:38:36,828 --> 01:38:39,081
- I love working with business majors.
- I'm telling you.

2019
01:38:39,164 --> 01:38:40,207
- Economics.
- Right.

2020
01:38:40,290 --> 01:38:45,212
You should know that Mark has already
taken his percentage from 60 down to 51.

2021
01:38:46,505 --> 01:38:49,758
Well, Mark doesn't care about money
and he needs to be protected.

2022
01:38:51,802 --> 01:38:54,137
Dustin Moskovitz owns 6.81%.

2023
01:38:54,221 --> 01:38:57,057
Sean Parker, 6.47%.

2024
01:38:59,309 --> 01:39:00,352
I can live with that.

2025
01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:02,270
And Peter Thiel, 7%.

2026
01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:08,944
Would you like to use my pen?

2027
01:39:09,194 --> 01:39:12,155
Eduardo? Eduardo?

2028
01:39:13,907 --> 01:39:15,033
Can you please repeat the question?

2029
01:39:15,117 --> 01:39:17,327
No, it was an outrageously leading question
the first time around,

2030
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:18,537
and now you want us to hear it twice?

2031
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:20,497
Yes. Would you read it back, please?

2032
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:21,623
Well, go ahead.

2033
01:39:21,706 --> 01:39:23,416
"Counsel: 'And when you signed
these documents,

2034
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:26,253
"'were you aware that you were signing
your own death certificate?"'

2035
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,420
No.

2036
01:39:31,842 --> 01:39:35,971
It was insanely stupid of me not to have
my own lawyers look over all the...

2037
01:39:36,054 --> 01:39:39,224
In all honesty,
I thought they were my lawyers.

2038
01:39:42,477 --> 01:39:44,062
I was your only friend.

2039
01:39:45,981 --> 01:39:47,315
You had one friend.

2040
01:39:52,154 --> 01:39:53,196
My father won't even look at me.

2041
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:58,368
Okay, Eduardo, did Mr Zuckerberg say
anything to you after you signed the papers?

2042
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:01,496
There was a lot of handshaking,
a lot of congratulations.

2043
01:40:02,664 --> 01:40:04,040
He'd already told me that he wouldn't be

2044
01:40:04,124 --> 01:40:07,252
coming back to school
for at least a semester,

2045
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:10,088
so we were saying goodbye for a while.

2046
01:40:10,881 --> 01:40:12,132
And then before I left he said...

2047
01:40:12,215 --> 01:40:13,300
But you gotta come back.

2048
01:40:13,383 --> 01:40:15,886
Somewhere around the end of November
or early December.

2049
01:40:15,969 --> 01:40:18,430
Peter wants to throw us an amazing party
when we hit a million members.

2050
01:40:18,513 --> 01:40:20,265
It's gonna be out of control.
You gotta come back for it.

2051
01:40:20,348 --> 01:40:21,641
A million members?

2052
01:40:21,725 --> 01:40:22,893
Yeah.

2053
01:40:23,393 --> 01:40:26,688
Remember the algorithm
on the window at Kirkland?

2054
01:40:27,606 --> 01:40:28,815
Yeah.

2055
01:40:32,235 --> 01:40:33,486
Yeah, I'll be here.

2056
01:40:38,658 --> 01:40:39,826
You sure about this?

2057
01:40:39,910 --> 01:40:41,077
You're 20 minutes late.

2058
01:40:41,161 --> 01:40:42,621
You're gonna walk in there
and say you overslept

2059
01:40:42,704 --> 01:40:43,830
and didn't have time to get dressed.

2060
01:40:43,914 --> 01:40:46,082
They're gonna pitch you.
Case Equity is going to pitch you.

2061
01:40:46,166 --> 01:40:47,751
They're gonna beg you to take their money.

2062
01:40:47,834 --> 01:40:49,502
You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod,
you're gonna nod,

2063
01:40:49,586 --> 01:40:52,631
and then you're gonna say,
"Which one of you is Roth?"

2064
01:40:52,714 --> 01:40:54,132
No, not Roth. Manningham.

2065
01:40:54,216 --> 01:40:56,343
"Which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?"
And he'll say, "I am."

2066
01:40:56,426 --> 01:40:59,888
And then you say,
"Sean Parker says, 'Fuck you."'

2067
01:41:00,430 --> 01:41:01,765
Walk out.

2068
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:03,058
Okay.

2069
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:18,031
In late November, I got the e-mail from Mark

2070
01:41:18,114 --> 01:41:20,158
telling me to come out
for the millionth-member party.

2071
01:41:20,242 --> 01:41:21,284
What else did the e-mail say?

2072
01:41:21,868 --> 01:41:24,037
It said that we had to have
a business meeting.

2073
01:41:24,913 --> 01:41:28,166
That Mark and Sean had played
some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity,

2074
01:41:28,833 --> 01:41:30,460
<i>and that Manningham was so impressed</i>

2075
01:41:30,543 --> 01:41:34,464
<i>that he was now making an investment offer
that was hard to turn down.</i>

2076
01:41:34,547 --> 01:41:38,718
<i>So I went to California,
and I went straight to the new offices.</i>

2077
01:41:38,802 --> 01:41:42,514
<i>I didn't know whether to dress for the party
or for the business meeting,</i>

2078
01:41:42,597 --> 01:41:44,975
<i>so I kind of dressed for both.</i>

2079
01:41:45,684 --> 01:41:47,644
<i>-But it didn't matter.
- Why not?</i>

2080
01:41:47,727 --> 01:41:49,938
<i>Because I wasn't called out there
for either one.</i>

2081
01:41:50,021 --> 01:41:51,606
What were you called out there for?

2082
01:41:55,443 --> 01:41:56,820
An ambush.

2083
01:41:57,237 --> 01:41:59,072
Mr Saverin. Hey. Right over here.

2084
01:42:06,204 --> 01:42:07,247
Hey, man.

2085
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:08,373
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

2086
01:42:08,456 --> 01:42:11,167
- Good, good, good, good, good.
- Good to see you.

2087
01:42:11,251 --> 01:42:14,713
At first I thought he was joking.
Giving me more contracts to sign.

2088
01:42:19,092 --> 01:42:20,885
But then I started reading.

2089
01:42:24,264 --> 01:42:26,057
Wait, what is this?

2090
01:42:26,391 --> 01:42:29,644
Well, as you know, we had some
new investors that have come in.

2091
01:42:29,769 --> 01:42:30,812
What is this?

2092
01:42:43,116 --> 01:42:44,576
Mr Saverin.

2093
01:42:47,203 --> 01:42:48,371
Mark!

2094
01:42:49,664 --> 01:42:51,124
- Mark?
- He's wired in.

2095
01:42:51,207 --> 01:42:52,250
- Sorry?
- He's wired in.

2096
01:42:52,334 --> 01:42:53,793
- Is he?
- Yes.

2097
01:42:55,378 --> 01:42:58,131
- How about now? Are you still wired in?
- Call security.

2098
01:42:58,214 --> 01:43:00,050
You issued 24 million new shares of stock!

2099
01:43:01,259 --> 01:43:02,886
You were told that if new investors
came along...

2100
01:43:02,969 --> 01:43:06,097
How much were your shares diluted?
How much were his?

2101
01:43:06,181 --> 01:43:09,934
What was Mr Zuckerberg's
ownership share diluted down to?

2102
01:43:10,268 --> 01:43:11,311
It wasn't.

2103
01:43:11,394 --> 01:43:15,023
What was Mr Moskovitz's ownership share
diluted down to?

2104
01:43:15,106 --> 01:43:16,441
It wasn't.

2105
01:43:16,524 --> 01:43:19,444
What was Sean Parker's ownership share
diluted down to?

2106
01:43:19,527 --> 01:43:20,570
It wasn't.

2107
01:43:20,653 --> 01:43:23,323
What was Peter Thiel's ownership share
diluted down to?

2108
01:43:23,406 --> 01:43:24,491
It wasn't.

2109
01:43:24,574 --> 01:43:27,577
And what was your ownership share
diluted down to?

2110
01:43:28,578 --> 01:43:31,247
.03%

2111
01:43:39,089 --> 01:43:41,383
- You signed the papers.
- You set me up.

2112
01:43:41,466 --> 01:43:44,010
You're gonna blame me because you were
the business head of the company,

2113
01:43:44,094 --> 01:43:45,970
and you made a bad business deal
with your own company?

2114
01:43:46,054 --> 01:43:47,680
It's gonna be like I'm not a part of Facebook.

2115
01:43:47,764 --> 01:43:49,099
It won't be like
you're not a part of Facebook.

2116
01:43:49,182 --> 01:43:50,225
You're not a part of Facebook.

2117
01:43:50,308 --> 01:43:52,685
- My name's on the masthead.
- You might wanna check again.

2118
01:43:52,769 --> 01:43:54,104
This because I froze the account?

2119
01:43:54,187 --> 01:43:56,356
You think we'd let you
parade around in your ridiculous suits,

2120
01:43:56,439 --> 01:43:57,482
pretending you were running this company?

2121
01:43:57,565 --> 01:43:59,901
Sorry, my Prada's at the cleaner's!

2122
01:43:59,984 --> 01:44:04,364
Along with my hoodie and my fuck-you
flip-flops, you pretentious douche bag!

2123
01:44:04,447 --> 01:44:06,116
Security's here. You'll be leaving now.

2124
01:44:06,199 --> 01:44:09,119
- I'm not signing those papers.
- We will get the signature.

2125
01:44:09,202 --> 01:44:11,329
Tell me this isn't about me
getting into the Phoenix.

2126
01:44:13,998 --> 01:44:18,211
You... You did it. I knew you did it.
You planted that story about the chicken!

2127
01:44:18,294 --> 01:44:20,422
- I didn't plant that story.
- What's he talking about?

2128
01:44:20,505 --> 01:44:23,466
- You had me accused of animal cruelty.
- Seriously. What the hell's the chicken?

2129
01:44:23,550 --> 01:44:25,260
And I'll bet what you hated the most

2130
01:44:25,343 --> 01:44:28,763
is that they identified me
as a co-founder of Facebook.

2131
01:44:29,222 --> 01:44:32,058
Which I am. You better lawyer up, asshole.

2132
01:44:32,142 --> 01:44:36,688
'Cause I'm not coming back for 30%.
I'm coming back for everything.

2133
01:44:43,153 --> 01:44:46,114
- Get him out of here.
- It's okay, I'm going.

2134
01:44:48,074 --> 01:44:49,367
Hang on.

2135
01:44:51,578 --> 01:44:53,163
Almost forgot.

2136
01:44:54,205 --> 01:44:56,499
Here's your $19,000.
I wouldn't cash it, though.

2137
01:44:56,583 --> 01:44:58,126
I drew it on the account you froze.

2138
01:45:03,423 --> 01:45:05,967
I like standing next to you, Sean.

2139
01:45:07,218 --> 01:45:09,345
It makes me look so tough.

2140
01:45:22,484 --> 01:45:23,776
Well...

2141
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:27,155
That's it, that's our show for tonight, people.

2142
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:29,532
And look, I wanna see everyone here
geared up for a party.

2143
01:45:29,616 --> 01:45:31,701
We're gonna walk into that club
like it's the Macy's Parade.

2144
01:45:31,784 --> 01:45:34,913
Mackey, put it up on the big screen.
We've gotta almost be there.

2145
01:45:38,166 --> 01:45:40,043
- You all right?
- Yeah.

2146
01:45:41,294 --> 01:45:42,754
You were kind of rough on him.

2147
01:45:42,837 --> 01:45:44,839
That's life in the NFL.

2148
01:45:45,048 --> 01:45:46,674
You know you didn't have to be
that rough on him.

2149
01:45:46,758 --> 01:45:48,927
- Listen, I put him...
- Sean!

2150
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:52,305
You didn't have to be that rough on him.

2151
01:45:52,388 --> 01:45:53,598
He almost killed it.

2152
01:45:56,351 --> 01:45:57,560
I'll send flowers.

2153
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:03,983
Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together
a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma.

2154
01:46:04,067 --> 01:46:05,318
Ashleigh's a sister.

2155
01:46:05,401 --> 01:46:06,945
- Ashleigh?
- The intern.

2156
01:46:07,028 --> 01:46:10,198
Yeah. I know who she is. Are you guys...

2157
01:46:10,823 --> 01:46:12,492
Ashleigh? Me? No.

2158
01:46:12,575 --> 01:46:14,035
Well, a little bit.

2159
01:46:14,911 --> 01:46:15,954
Why?

2160
01:46:16,037 --> 01:46:17,872
- No. Nothing, I just...
- Excuse me. Mark?

2161
01:46:17,956 --> 01:46:21,209
- We were just talking about you.
- Just that you're doing a really good job.

2162
01:46:21,876 --> 01:46:24,045
Thanks. I appreciate that.

2163
01:46:25,046 --> 01:46:26,130
These came in for you.

2164
01:46:26,214 --> 01:46:28,007
Put them on my desk.

2165
01:46:34,973 --> 01:46:36,391
What's the package?

2166
01:46:37,267 --> 01:46:38,309
Nothing.

2167
01:46:40,728 --> 01:46:42,230
- Mackey.
- Yes, sir.

2168
01:46:42,313 --> 01:46:43,606
Refresh.

2169
01:46:44,107 --> 01:46:45,316
Sweet!

2170
01:46:51,322 --> 01:46:53,366
And you're not a hugger.

2171
01:46:53,658 --> 01:46:54,951
I know.

2172
01:46:57,579 --> 01:46:59,038
One million!

2173
01:47:00,623 --> 01:47:03,376
Who's got champagne? Huh?

2174
01:47:04,711 --> 01:47:06,504
I've got champagne.

2175
01:47:26,357 --> 01:47:29,944
The next transformative development,
a picture-sharing application.

2176
01:47:30,028 --> 01:47:33,114
A place where you view pictures
that coincide with your social life.

2177
01:47:33,197 --> 01:47:36,200
It is the true digitalisation of real life.

2178
01:47:36,284 --> 01:47:38,745
- You can use a CD.
- You can do it off of me.

2179
01:47:38,828 --> 01:47:40,538
You don't just go to a party any more.

2180
01:47:40,622 --> 01:47:44,375
You go to a party with a digital camera,
and then your friends relive the party online.

2181
01:47:44,459 --> 01:47:45,835
And tagging. The idea...

2182
01:47:45,918 --> 01:47:49,130
- Would this be easier without the bra?
- It's worth finding out.

2183
01:47:56,888 --> 01:47:59,265
All right, shut the music down!

2184
01:47:59,641 --> 01:48:01,267
The party's over!

2185
01:48:01,351 --> 01:48:03,144
Everybody, go home!

2186
01:48:03,645 --> 01:48:06,105
I've spent hours watching
what people do when they log on.

2187
01:48:06,189 --> 01:48:07,565
How they check their friends' status updates.

2188
01:48:07,649 --> 01:48:09,150
Wait. That's weird. Why did the music stop?

2189
01:48:09,233 --> 01:48:10,401
Check to see which one of their friends

2190
01:48:10,485 --> 01:48:12,403
changed their profiles,
changed their photos...

2191
01:48:12,487 --> 01:48:14,072
Seriously, what happened to the music?

2192
01:48:14,155 --> 01:48:16,115
We lived on farms
and then we lived in cities,

2193
01:48:16,199 --> 01:48:18,159
and now we're going to live on the Internet!

2194
01:48:18,242 --> 01:48:21,913
Sean, stop.
I think something's going on downstairs.

2195
01:48:30,963 --> 01:48:33,758
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention, please?

2196
01:48:33,841 --> 01:48:37,095
It's time for you to go home.
The party is over.

2197
01:48:37,428 --> 01:48:39,263
Then it's all good.

2198
01:48:41,015 --> 01:48:42,100
- It's the cops.
- What?

2199
01:48:42,183 --> 01:48:43,226
Shit! Shit.

2200
01:48:43,309 --> 01:48:47,063
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- Okay, it's okay. Be cool.

2201
01:48:47,605 --> 01:48:49,774
Good to see you, Officer.
What can I do for you?

2202
01:48:50,983 --> 01:48:52,026
What's going on?

2203
01:48:52,110 --> 01:48:54,696
Was the music too loud?
We were having a celebration.

2204
01:48:54,779 --> 01:48:56,322
Miss, I need you to button your blouse.

2205
01:48:56,406 --> 01:48:59,200
I can tell them to turn the music down.

2206
01:49:03,121 --> 01:49:04,163
That's not mine.

2207
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:07,583
Okay, we're gonna need identification.
Keep your hands where we can see them.

2208
01:49:07,667 --> 01:49:09,085
Oh, my God.

2209
01:49:09,168 --> 01:49:10,878
You got anything else in your pockets
I should know about?

2210
01:49:10,962 --> 01:49:12,004
No, sir. No.

2211
01:49:12,088 --> 01:49:14,340
- Don't be stupid, now.
- I don't, I don't.

2212
01:49:19,429 --> 01:49:20,930
What's this?

2213
01:49:21,139 --> 01:49:22,849
That's an EpiPen.

2214
01:49:23,933 --> 01:49:26,269
- And this?
- That's my inhaler.

2215
01:49:27,103 --> 01:49:28,771
How old are you?

2216
01:49:29,355 --> 01:49:30,773
Twenty-one.

2217
01:49:31,232 --> 01:49:32,275
Twenty-one.

2218
01:49:32,358 --> 01:49:33,776
- Twenty-one.
- I'm 21.

2219
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:35,528
Lying only makes it worse.

2220
01:49:36,904 --> 01:49:39,407
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

2221
01:49:50,418 --> 01:49:51,461
Hello.

2222
01:49:51,544 --> 01:49:54,046
Listen, something's happened.

2223
01:50:01,345 --> 01:50:02,388
Shit.

2224
01:50:02,472 --> 01:50:04,390
No, it's all right. It's gonna be all right.

2225
01:50:04,474 --> 01:50:08,478
I posted bond, and I wasn't doing anything.
I mean, I've got allergies.

2226
01:50:13,274 --> 01:50:14,317
Interns.

2227
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:16,235
It was just a party.

2228
01:50:19,030 --> 01:50:22,408
This is gonna be news, Sean.
It's gonna be online any second.

2229
01:50:23,618 --> 01:50:24,660
I know.

2230
01:50:24,744 --> 01:50:26,412
You know with an intern...

2231
01:50:26,496 --> 01:50:28,664
No, it's cool. I have it under control.

2232
01:50:28,748 --> 01:50:30,333
I will get it under control.

2233
01:50:30,458 --> 01:50:32,794
I will call someone
and see what the next move is.

2234
01:50:32,877 --> 01:50:34,420
But this is gonna be news now.

2235
01:50:35,171 --> 01:50:37,673
You don't think Wardo
was involved, do you?

2236
01:50:37,757 --> 01:50:38,800
I mean, do you think...

2237
01:50:38,883 --> 01:50:39,967
No.

2238
01:50:40,176 --> 01:50:42,053
Or Manningham. One of them.

2239
01:50:42,136 --> 01:50:45,389
Somebody. Somebody sent the coke
in there, because it got in there.

2240
01:50:45,473 --> 01:50:47,308
You believe me. God, this is gonna be fine.

2241
01:50:52,146 --> 01:50:53,356
Right?

2242
01:50:56,108 --> 01:50:57,693
Go home, Sean.

2243
01:51:12,917 --> 01:51:14,126
<i>Mark?</i>

2244
01:51:16,003 --> 01:51:17,088
<i>Mark.</i>

2245
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:21,259
We're done for the day.

2246
01:51:21,342 --> 01:51:23,928
Yeah. Yeah, I was just sitting here.

2247
01:51:27,598 --> 01:51:29,517
What happened to Sean?

2248
01:51:29,851 --> 01:51:32,270
He still owns 7% of the company.

2249
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:40,695
All you had all day was that salad.
Do you wanna get something to eat?

2250
01:51:40,778 --> 01:51:42,113
I can't.

2251
01:51:49,787 --> 01:51:51,038
I'm not a bad guy.

2252
01:51:51,122 --> 01:51:52,623
I know that.

2253
01:51:52,999 --> 01:51:56,502
When there's emotional testimony,
I assume 85% of it is exaggeration.

2254
01:51:56,627 --> 01:51:58,087
And the other 15?

2255
01:51:58,170 --> 01:52:01,299
Perjury. Creation myths need a devil.

2256
01:52:04,969 --> 01:52:06,304
What happens now?

2257
01:52:07,471 --> 01:52:11,684
Sy and the others are having a steak
on University Avenue.

2258
01:52:12,184 --> 01:52:13,644
Then they'll come back up to the office,

2259
01:52:13,728 --> 01:52:17,023
and start working on a settlement
agreement to present to you.

2260
01:52:17,148 --> 01:52:19,025
- They're gonna settle?
- Oh, yeah.

2261
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:22,486
- And you're gonna have to pay a little extra.
- Why?

2262
01:52:22,570 --> 01:52:24,739
So that these guys sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

2263
01:52:24,822 --> 01:52:27,825
They say one unflattering word about you
in public, you own their wife and kids.

2264
01:52:27,909 --> 01:52:29,118
I invented Facebook.

2265
01:52:29,201 --> 01:52:31,329
I'm talking about a jury.

2266
01:52:31,579 --> 01:52:34,165
I specialise in voir dire, jury selection.

2267
01:52:34,248 --> 01:52:36,626
What a jury sees
when they look at a defendant.

2268
01:52:36,709 --> 01:52:39,086
Clothes, hair, speaking style, likeability...

2269
01:52:39,170 --> 01:52:40,379
Likeability.

2270
01:52:40,504 --> 01:52:43,341
I've been licensed to practise law
for all of 20 months,

2271
01:52:43,424 --> 01:52:44,800
and I could get a jury to believe

2272
01:52:44,884 --> 01:52:47,595
that you planted the story
about Eduardo and the chicken.

2273
01:52:47,678 --> 01:52:48,763
Watch what else.

2274
01:52:49,263 --> 01:52:51,349
Why weren't you at Sean's sorority party
that night?

2275
01:52:52,099 --> 01:52:54,310
- You think I'm the one that called the police?
- Doesn't matter.

2276
01:52:54,393 --> 01:52:56,479
I asked the question,
now everybody's thinking about it.

2277
01:52:56,562 --> 01:52:58,689
You've lost your jury in the first 10 minutes.

2278
01:53:00,358 --> 01:53:01,484
Farm animals.

2279
01:53:01,567 --> 01:53:02,735
Yeah.

2280
01:53:03,736 --> 01:53:06,280
I was drunk and angry and stupid.

2281
01:53:06,364 --> 01:53:08,616
- And blogging.
- And blogging.

2282
01:53:09,742 --> 01:53:11,077
Pay them.

2283
01:53:11,369 --> 01:53:12,578
In the scheme of things,

2284
01:53:13,037 --> 01:53:14,372
it's a speeding ticket.

2285
01:53:16,374 --> 01:53:18,751
That's what Sy will tell you tomorrow.

2286
01:53:18,876 --> 01:53:21,754
Do you think anybody would mind if I stayed
and used the computer for a minute?

2287
01:53:21,879 --> 01:53:23,381
I can't imagine it would be a problem.

2288
01:53:23,464 --> 01:53:24,715
Thanks.

2289
01:53:25,549 --> 01:53:27,885
I appreciate your help today.

2290
01:53:31,722 --> 01:53:33,975
You're not an asshole, Mark.

2291
01:53:35,226 --> 01:53:37,728
You're just trying so hard to be.
