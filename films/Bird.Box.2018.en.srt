1
00:00:14,116 --> 00:00:17,122
<i>We have a place, a compound.</i>

2
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:18,959
<i>We have a community.</i>

3
00:00:20,264 --> 00:00:22,155
<i>It's safe here.</i>

4
00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:25,241
<i>How many of you are there?</i>

5
00:00:26,495 --> 00:00:28,920
<i>Are any of them children?</i>

6
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,715
<i>Because the fastest way
to get here is by the river,</i>

7
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,764
<i>and I don't think
you could make it... with kids.</i>

8
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,123
<font color=#FF00FF>*BIRD BOX*</font>

9
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:49,044
Listen to me.
I'm only gonna say this once.

10
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:52,149
We are going on the trip now.
It's going to be rough.

11
00:00:52,214 --> 00:00:55,006
It's gonna feel like
it's going on for a long time,

12
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:56,904
so it's gonna be hard to stay alert.

13
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,974
It's gonna be even harder to be quiet,
but you have to do both.

14
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,891
You have to do every single thing I say
or we will not make it.

15
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:07,272
Understand?

16
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,927
Under no circumstance

17
00:01:10,992 --> 00:01:13,548
are you allowed
to take off your blindfold.

18
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:16,216
If I find that you have,
I will hurt you.

19
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:18,100
Do you understand?

20
00:01:19,735 --> 00:01:22,090
It's cold.
We have blankets.

21
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:24,560
Boy, you have your dog.
Girl, you have your kitty.

22
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,052
This is just a place.

23
00:01:26,117 --> 00:01:28,478
There's nothing more
that we need from it.

24
00:01:28,543 --> 00:01:30,561
Do you understand?

25
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:36,091
And no talking
on the river.

26
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:39,615
You must listen
as closely as you can.

27
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:42,465
If you hear something in the woods,
you tell me.

28
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,927
If you hear something in the water,
you tell me.

29
00:01:44,992 --> 00:01:48,709
But you never, ever
take off your blindfold.

30
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:50,990
If you look, you will die.

31
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:52,787
Do you understand?

32
00:01:56,305 --> 00:01:59,545
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

33
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,716
- Kitty.
- It's okay. It's okay.

34
00:02:13,928 --> 00:02:15,287
Let's go.

35
00:02:29,842 --> 00:02:31,313
Okay. Okay.

36
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:35,730
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

37
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,186
Hm.
Ah.

38
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:52,293
Twenty-eight, 29, 30.
Okay, this way. It's fine.

39
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,160
Thirty-one, 32, 33.

40
00:02:54,268 --> 00:02:56,065
Where is it? Where is it?

- Uh... asshole, I was listening to that.
- Yeah, so were the people down the street.

48
00:04:11,746 --> 00:04:14,465
The store was packed.
This thing seems serious.

49
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,485
Wow, you literally
have no food.

50
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,720
- What... What thing?
- Are you serious?

51
00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:20,704
- I'm serious.
- Turn on the news, dumb-dumb.

52
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:21,977
Dumb-dumb.

53
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:24,571
- What channel, dumb-dumb?
- Any one of them.

54
00:04:24,686 --> 00:04:27,376
<i>Airports and train stations
have shut down.</i>

55
00:04:27,446 --> 00:04:31,465
<i>Streets are crowded with people
escaping cities by car and on foot</i>

56
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,048
<i>as witnesses report
unexplained mass suicides.</i>

57
00:04:35,113 --> 00:04:36,813
<i>First recorded in Romania,</i>

58
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:40,564
<i>there's now an alarming spread
of incidents into Europe and Siberia.</i>

59
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:43,673
<i>Estimated death toll

60
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:47,446
<i>..don't yet know what is causing
the mass suicides in Europe and Russia.</i>

61
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:51,446
<i>The eyewitness reports tell of people
exhibiting psychotic behavior.</i>

62
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,928
<i>Our sources are telling us</i>

63
00:04:52,996 --> 00:04:55,649

66
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:02,886
Well, it's in Russia,
so...

67
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:06,863
Well, try telling that to the soccer moms
fighting over bottled water.

68
00:05:06,928 --> 00:05:10,152
Speaking of which,
I just got off the phone with Mom.

69
00:05:10,217 --> 00:05:12,378
How come I have to update her
about you all the time?

70
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:15,750
- Why do you have to talk about me?
- I'm not telling her about my life.

71
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:18,323
At three o'clock,
I'm gonna go check out

72
00:05:18,388 --> 00:05:20,144
an Arabian stud
in Sausalito.

73
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:22,215
See, now that is a sentence
you don't hear every day.

74
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,667
- You wanna come?
- I can't.

75
00:05:23,732 --> 00:05:26,050
I've got my OB
with Dr. Lapham.

76
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:27,824
- Lapham, when?
- Oh, my God.

77
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:29,879
Why does your voice get high
when it gets excited?

78
00:05:29,944 --> 00:05:31,504
- How about I drive you?
- No, I'm fine.

79
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:33,551
I can go in.
We can maybe see the baby.

80
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:36,144
Or I can cancel the appointment
and we can go and see a horse.

81
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:37,954
No.
Fuck the horse.

82
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:40,477
Wow.
Such venom.

83
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,465
What do you think?

84
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,941
I think I see
a whole bunch of people sitting together,

85
00:05:49,006 --> 00:05:50,853
but they all feel incredibly lonely.

86
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:53,004
The loneliness is just incidental.

87
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:56,039
It's really about
people's inability to connect.

88
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:00,506
Inability to connect to what?

89
00:06:00,571 --> 00:06:01,940
- Can you move?
- Malorie.

90
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:03,745
- I need you to move.
- We've been through this.

91
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,847
- Mm-hmm.
- That's not how it's gonna be for you.

92
00:06:06,787 --> 00:06:09,730
It's different with a baby.
It's an immediate love affair.

93
00:06:09,795 --> 00:06:11,839
- It's not gonna be that way for me.
- Yes, it will.

94
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,748
- No, ma'am.
- You should be afraid of being alone,

95
00:06:13,826 --> 00:06:15,053
not of this.

96
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:19,644
And what we need to do is get you...

97
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:22,448
out into the real world
with other people,

98
00:06:22,545 --> 00:06:24,745
not stuck in this house all day.
You never leave.

99
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,798
Why should I leave?
I have you to get me groceries.

100
00:06:26,863 --> 00:06:28,253
- You have to move.
- No, not moving.

101
00:06:28,318 --> 00:06:29,597
- Yes, you do.
- Not moving.

102
00:06:29,662 --> 00:06:31,222
- Why?
- Not moving. I love my house!

103
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:33,715
I know it took you a long time
to find a studio you loved,

104
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,237
and ever since Ryan left,
you've gotten a lot more work done.

105
00:06:36,302 --> 00:06:38,636
But, so fine, so no more roommates.

106
00:06:38,808 --> 00:06:40,026
Ryan was not a roommate.

107
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:42,250
Uh, it turns out
he kind of was.

108
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:48,870
Anyway, can't raise a kid here.
Where would you even put her?

109
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:51,086
How do you know it's a she?

110
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:53,878
Wishful thinking, I guess.

111
00:06:59,175 --> 00:07:01,550
Sorry, it's work.
I'll be there in a second.

112
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:03,186
Hi.

113
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:06,580
Yeah, they just had
to push the surgery back an hour.

114
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:07,852
Yes?

115
00:07:10,735 --> 00:07:11,770
Yeah.

116
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:13,135
I'll call right back.

117
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,336
What?

118
00:07:15,584 --> 00:07:17,448
You still don't wanna know
the gender?

119
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:20,219
- And ruin the surprise, Dr. Lapham?
- No.

120
00:07:21,146 --> 00:07:24,464
How have you been feeling?
Have you been sleeping any better?

121
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,693
Rough.

122
00:07:25,787 --> 00:07:28,675
I never slept well
before I had this condition.

123
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,956
It's called pregnancy.
It's okay to say it out loud.

124
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:33,862
Oh, don't you know, Doctor,
if you don't acknowledge a thing,

125
00:07:33,927 --> 00:07:35,362
- it simply goes away?
- Oh, really?

126
00:07:35,427 --> 00:07:36,949
All this time,
I had no idea.

127
00:07:37,014 --> 00:07:38,730
- When a horse gets pregnant...
- God, the horse.

128
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:39,987
You know about horses?

129
00:07:40,052 --> 00:07:42,878
When a horse gets pregnant,
it knows right away.

130
00:07:42,943 --> 00:07:44,940
- Does it?
- It changes the way it eats.

131
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:46,151
It changes its gait.

132
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,222
It bites all the other horses
who come too close.

133
00:07:49,287 --> 00:07:50,318
It's too bad
we're not horses.

134
00:07:50,396 --> 00:07:52,089
It is too bad.
Great to be a horse.

135
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:53,651
Then we would have, like,
a mother

136
00:07:53,748 --> 00:07:55,253
who would have
actually raised us

137
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,276
and a father
off on some faraway stud farm.

138
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:00,940
Hold on.
Our father was off on a faraway stud farm.

139
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:03,391
- That is correct.
- That is correct.

140
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:05,449
Poor us.

141
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:09,097
We should go feel sorry for ourselves
with lunch and a bottle of wine.

142
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,464
Oh, finally,
now you're making some sense.

143
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:13,354
- Good.
- Really, in front of me?

144
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:14,143
- We didn't mean it...
- No,

145
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,269
- like a little tiny glass of rosé
- like a little tiny glass of rosé

146
00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:17,675
is not gonna hurt
the little bean.

147
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,495
I'm pretty sure
I heard the word "bottle."

148
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,854
You might want to think of a name
besides "little bean"

149
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,440
seeing as your child
is now the size of a small melon.

150
00:08:24,693 --> 00:08:25,972
- Small melon!
- Small melon!

151
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:29,097
I know it's hard to love someone
you haven't met yet.

152
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:31,141
Oh, that's beautiful.

153
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:34,253
Thought about stitching that on,
like, a little

154
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:35,667
lavender sachet?

155
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:37,913
- Could sell them in the gift shop.
- In the gift shop.

156
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:39,683
You're having a baby,
Malorie.

157
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,401
Pretty soon
you and I, Jessica,

158
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:44,472
and some hard-ass labor
and delivery nurse

159
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:46,634
will be on the third floor
making the same wise cracks.

160
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:49,664
Only this time,
you won't be going home by yourself.

161
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:52,604
I know.
I know.

162
00:08:54,004 --> 00:08:56,314
But if that's not
what you want,

163
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:59,581
there are plenty of couples
who are desperate to adopt a child.

164
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:02,769
There are no judgments here.
You can make whatever choice you want.

165
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,143
But
what you can't do is ignore it

166
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:06,906
and hope it just goes away.

167
00:09:20,103 --> 00:09:21,597
You okay in there?

168
00:09:21,857 --> 00:09:23,203
I'm great.

169
00:09:23,985 --> 00:09:25,414
Are you puking?

170
00:09:26,763 --> 00:09:27,776
Just go to the car.

171
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:28,955
Is it chunky?

172
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:31,636
No, it was actually the
really smooth kind

173
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:33,597
that just shoots out
real clean.

174
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:35,344
<i>I'll meet you at the car,
okay?</i>

175
00:09:36,193 --> 00:09:39,003
- In the corridor.
- Let's get it clear.

176
00:09:56,058 --> 00:09:58,485
Hey!
Hey! Hey, security!

177
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,657
Watch out. Help. I need help!

178
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:03,212
No, get back!

179
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:06,144
- <i>Calm down. Please calm down.</i>
- Code gray. Level one.

180
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:08,727
Calm down.
Security!

181
00:10:18,237 --> 00:10:20,578
- You feel better?
- It's happening now.

182
00:10:20,878 --> 00:10:22,570
- You get any on you?
- Whatever it's in Russia, the thing

183
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:24,564
that's making everybody crazy,
it's here, it's here now.

184
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:26,508
- What?
- Can you just, please...

185
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:30,151
<i>- Madam, hold on.
- Inside the hospital.</i>

186
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:31,766
Go, go, go, go!

187
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:39,790
Go, go, go, go, go!

188
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,368
- We're going straight to Santa Rosa.
- <i>I don't want</i>

189
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,462
- You can stay at my place until
- to go...

190
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:49,813
whatever the fuck
this is isn't.

191
00:10:49,878 --> 00:10:52,243
- I don't have any clothes.
- You can wear something of mine.

192
00:10:52,308 --> 00:10:54,102
I'm not much of
a chaps-and-boots gal.

193
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:56,290
Yeah, you're worried about
what to wear right now?

194
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,821
Well, I find it comforting
to focus on the wrong things.

195
00:10:59,082 --> 00:11:00,883
- Shit.
- What?

196
00:11:00,948 --> 00:11:02,227
There's a car stopped in

197
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:03,876
- the middle of the fucking road.
- Stop. Stop. Just go round.

198
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,157
Move. Move.
Let me go.

199
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:07,720
If this thing gets any worse,
you'll wanna be off the roads

200
00:11:07,785 --> 00:11:09,955
and on a damn horse,
trust me.

201
00:11:13,742 --> 00:11:16,071
- Oh, my God!
- Shit. Shit, shit, shit!

202
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,767
People have to stop
being so stupid.

203
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:22,139
- Oh, my God.
- Jess. Just go. Go, go. Go, go.

204
00:11:22,204 --> 00:11:23,108
I'm not running the light

205
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:24,327
- with a pregnant lady in the car.
- Nobody is there. Nobody is there.

206
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,634
- I don't drive... car. No.
- Just drive the car!

207
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:27,788
You gotta let me just drive.
You're freaking me out.

208
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,821
- You know what?
- Just let me do it.

209
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:37,038
- This isn't me.
- My phone is in the back seat.

210
00:11:37,103 --> 00:11:39,748
- It's the foreman wondering where I am.
- Right, just hold your horses.

211
00:11:39,813 --> 00:11:41,748
- Yeah, ha ha.
- What did you do with it?

212
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:45,422
Oh, my God.
What the fuck is that?

213
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:47,305
What the fuck is what?

214
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,813
What the fuck is what?

215
00:11:50,645 --> 00:11:52,649
What the fuck is what?
What are you looking at?

216
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:54,743
What did you see? Talk to me.
What the fuck is what?

217
00:11:54,808 --> 00:11:57,502
What are you doing? Oh, my God, Jess.
Jess, don't do that.

218
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,293
Just what are you...
What is wrong with you?

219
00:11:59,371 --> 00:12:01,541
No, no, no, no.
Stop it! Stop it!

220
00:12:01,606 --> 00:12:03,112
No, no, no, no!
Please.

221
00:12:03,177 --> 00:12:04,245
Stop it! Stop it!

222
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,752
Jess, what the fuck is wrong with you?
Jess, please. Stop it, Jess.

223
00:12:07,817 --> 00:12:10,422
God damn it! Stop it!
Please stop it!

224
00:13:27,603 --> 00:13:29,654
- Lydia, what are you doing?
- She's pregnant.

225
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:31,897
Lydia, not now.
Let's go in.

226
00:13:31,962 --> 00:13:33,136
She's pregnant.

227
00:13:33,201 --> 00:13:34,670
You can't help!

228
00:13:36,228 --> 00:13:38,292
Hurry, come inside!

229
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:39,516
Okay.

230
00:13:42,735 --> 00:13:44,806
Sweetheart, get up.
Right now.

231
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:46,038
<i>Idea!</i>

232
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:47,207
Mom.

233
00:13:47,897 --> 00:13:49,508
Please don't go.

234
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:52,508
Please don't go.

235
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:04,148
Hey. Hey. Hey.

236
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:07,242
Keep your eyes down.
Keep your eyes down.

237
00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:31,346
Open the door.
This woman is pregnant.

238
00:14:31,411 --> 00:14:33,375
- <i>Open the door!</i>
- No.

239
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:37,844
- Hey! Open the door. Police.
- Don't open it.

240
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:40,620
- <i>Police! Open the fucking door!</i>
- I'm sorry. It's my house.

241
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:42,635
Get in. Hurry!

242
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,127
Come on.
You good?

243
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:47,844
Are you okay?

244
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,484
She went to help you.

245
00:14:58,436 --> 00:15:00,070
Now she's gone.

246
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:04,487
<i>Come on. Now everybody's
obviously just a little freaked out.</i>

247
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:07,666
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- <i>Come in. Come inside the house.</i>

248
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,698
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

249
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,413
<i>Is everybody all right?</i>

250
00:15:15,478 --> 00:15:18,337
<i>Is anyone getting service in here?
You don't have any Wi-Fi?</i>

251
00:15:18,402 --> 00:15:19,744
<i>I have not gotten any.</i>

252
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:21,027
Come on.

253
00:15:21,472 --> 00:15:23,371
<i>- It's not working.
- I gotta get a hold of my kids.</i>

254
00:15:23,436 --> 00:15:25,213
No, nothing.

255
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:27,831
- Honey?
- Nothing. I have nothing.

256
00:15:28,211 --> 00:15:29,883
<i>- They're at home?
- Excuse me.</i>

257
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:36,746
Mom? Mom, call me.
Call me right now.

258
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,430
Something...
Hello? Hello?

259
00:15:42,537 --> 00:15:45,996
That thing fucks with your nervous system.
I've seen it in my clients for weeks.

260
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:48,328
Hey, did I mention
I'm a fucking cop?

261
00:15:49,763 --> 00:15:51,683
You're in the Academy.
Doesn't make you a cop.

262
00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:55,269
Whatever it is,
I'm sure they'll send someone soon.

263
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:57,542
No, the only thing
that will happen soon

264
00:15:57,607 --> 00:15:59,742
is we're all gonna die
soon.

265
00:16:00,003 --> 00:16:03,563
This has a classic
bio-warfare signature.

266
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:05,550
North Korea or Iran.

267
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:08,438
<i>Douglas, that's it.
They don't know what it is yet, okay?</i>

268
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:10,455
<i>We just all gotta try to stay calm.</i>

269
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,871
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

270
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:13,602
<i>Please.</i>

271
00:16:15,552 --> 00:16:17,141
We are so fucking fucked.

272
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:19,202
I think I heard one.

273
00:16:19,267 --> 00:16:20,773
We were running up the street,

274
00:16:20,838 --> 00:16:24,516
and I swear to God,
I-I-I-I felt something.

275
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:26,055
- I heard something.
- Did you see it? What was it?

276
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,246
I-I-I-I don't know.
It was just there.

277
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:31,219
- The presence?
- Yeah.

278
00:16:31,561 --> 00:16:33,250
So fucking fucked.

279
00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:42,455
Gotta be an image out there.
They must have released some video.

280
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,930
- I haven't seen anything.
- My crew saw one.

281
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:46,242
- What?
- What?

282
00:16:46,307 --> 00:16:49,227
One minute,
we were digging a foundation...

283
00:16:49,436 --> 00:16:52,649
and then my contractor just lies down
in front of the bulldozer.

284
00:16:52,714 --> 00:16:56,477
And then my operator tips the rig
into the ditch and snaps his own neck.

285
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:59,695
- Oh.
- It seems like if you look at it,

286
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,578
it makes you crazy
or it makes you wanna hurt yourself.

287
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:06,214
No, it makes you kill yourself.

288
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:09,719
And you just...
you just look at it.

289
00:17:09,784 --> 00:17:12,125
- And you commit suicide.
- How can that be?

290
00:17:12,395 --> 00:17:15,703
Close the windows. Get the windows!
Close all the windows.

291
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,399
Everybody, get the windows.

292
00:17:28,957 --> 00:17:30,303
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

293
00:17:30,368 --> 00:17:31,881
Andy, Bailey, can you hear me?

294
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:34,279
Dad? What's that thing outside?

295
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,191
- Bailey! Bailey?
- Bailey.

296
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:39,475
Bailey! Bailey!

297
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:42,404
- If you go outside, you'll die.
- My children are out there!

298
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:44,492
- Move!
- You won't make it to your children!

299
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:47,750
- It's back on. Turn it up.
- <i>The President has declared</i>

300
00:17:47,828 --> 00:17:50,600
a state of emergency
and has closed all borders.

301
00:17:50,844 --> 00:17:53,437
<i>Do not, do not go outside.</i>

302
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:55,953
<i>Avoid social media. Use radi...</i>

303
00:17:57,936 --> 00:18:00,482
What?
What in the shit is happening?

304
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:03,496
- It's an end game, man.
- I'm sorry, what?

305
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:07,538
The end game. Humanity has been judged,
and we've been found wanting.

306
00:18:07,603 --> 00:18:10,592
- Judged? By who?
- They go by different names. Right.

307
00:18:10,821 --> 00:18:14,330
You got world religion and mythology
that's full of mentions of demons

308
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:17,038
or spirit creatures.
People who've seen these creatures

309
00:18:17,103 --> 00:18:19,663
almost always describe
their encounter as this...

310
00:18:19,728 --> 00:18:23,516
as with an entity that takes on
a form of your worst fears or...

311
00:18:23,774 --> 00:18:25,621
your deepest sadness
or your greatest loss.

312
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:27,725
Sounds like bullshit to me.
Religious talk.

313
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:31,201
It's not bullshit, okay?
It's real talk. It's facts.

314
00:18:31,313 --> 00:18:32,756
They come in all different forms.

315
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:37,663
You got the Aka Manah, the Varios Daevas
from ancient Zoroastrian legend.

316
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:40,871
You've got the Surgat
from ancient Christian occult beliefs

317
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:45,311
that made pregnant women encounter
their unborn children as other creatures

318
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:46,857
such as lobsters or spiders.

319
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:51,186
You've got the Huli-jing from China.
You've got the Puca from Celtic mythology.

320
00:18:51,251 --> 00:18:54,371
All different names,
but the same thing.

321
00:18:54,436 --> 00:18:55,789
And what's that?

322
00:18:57,441 --> 00:18:58,859
The end of us.

323
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:02,773
Charlie, did you learn all of that
working at the supermarket?

324
00:19:03,561 --> 00:19:06,705
- No, I've been studying it for years.
- In college?

325
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,163
Not college per se, but...

326
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:11,951
I mean the Internet. That's where you get
all your information from.

327
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:14,951
- I'm working on a novel, guys.
- Fuck's sake.

328
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:17,868
<i>So we can't do anything
but wait here until we go crazy like him?</i>

329
00:19:17,936 --> 00:19:21,467
<i>The army is bound
to get this under control.</i>

330
00:19:21,532 --> 00:19:23,068
<i>We just have to wait.</i>

331
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:27,038
Hey. Hey.
Why don't we sit back down?

332
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,871
No, no, no. I'm fine.
I'm... I'm just trying to make a call.

333
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,455
- Understood. Understood.
- <i>I'm okay.</i>

334
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,654
Understood. Understood.
Um...

335
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:35,709
I don't think, the phones aren't working
right now.

336
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,225
- Okay. Okay.
- But...

337
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:40,537
Listen, are you in any pain?

338
00:19:41,707 --> 00:19:42,803
What? No. No.

339
00:19:42,868 --> 00:19:45,865
- I feel like you may have a concussion.
- I am fine. I'm fine.

340
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,522
- Okay. Okay.
- I am fine.

341
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:48,712
Okay.

342
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,459
We were just driving.

343
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:00,998
And then she saw something.

344
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:05,984
I didn't see what it was,
but then she got this look on her face.

345
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:18,117
It's like she got...

346
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:28,654
She got so sad,
and Jess does not get sad.

347
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,156
No.

348
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,475
She stepped out of the car
and ran into the street...

349
00:20:34,603 --> 00:20:36,490
and she's not suicidal.

350
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,734
She would never do that.

351
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:40,943
But it was...

352
00:20:41,061 --> 00:20:44,475
And then that woman...
that woman, she saw me,

353
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,256
and then she started talking
to her mom and I...

354
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:51,742
That woman
was my wife.

355
00:20:52,063 --> 00:20:54,397
- Her name was Lydia.
- Okay.

356
00:20:54,478 --> 00:20:58,797
And she wasn't talking to her mother.
Her mother's been dead ten years.

357
00:22:18,732 --> 00:22:20,086
Hello?

358
00:22:20,686 --> 00:22:22,769
Hello, can anybody hear me? Hello?

359
00:22:27,603 --> 00:22:30,172
Hello? Can anybody hear me? Hello.

360
00:22:31,228 --> 00:22:33,730
Is anybody out there?
Hello, my name is Malorie.

361
00:22:33,795 --> 00:22:36,128
I'm on the river.
Is anybody out there?

362
00:22:36,478 --> 00:22:39,281
Hello? Hello?
Is anybody out there?

363
00:22:40,311 --> 00:22:42,883
Can anybody hear me? Hello?

364
00:22:51,895 --> 00:22:55,292
<i>Malorie. Malorie.</i>

365
00:23:00,313 --> 00:23:01,956
<i>Malorie.</i>

366
00:23:09,478 --> 00:23:13,996
<i>It's been three days
since these, um, events unfolded.</i>

367
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,670
<i>Station's lines are down.</i>

368
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:17,705
<i>I can't get in touch with anyone.</i>

369
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,455
<i>We haven't heard anything
from any authorities...</i>

370
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,788
<i>but if you are listening,</i>

371
00:23:21,853 --> 00:23:24,788
<i>from what I can gather,
as long as you stay indoors,</i>

372
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:28,381
<i>as long as you don't look
at those things...</i>

373
00:23:28,853 --> 00:23:30,330
<i>you should be fine.</i>

374
00:23:30,524 --> 00:23:32,145
<i>Do not go outside.</i>

375
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,502
<i>The moment I receive any more news,
I will be sure to update you.</i>

376
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,621
My husband works in trusts and estates.
What kind of law do you practice?

377
00:23:40,686 --> 00:23:43,975
- Bankruptcy.
- When he's not suing his neighbors.

378
00:23:44,061 --> 00:23:45,876
Hey, how long's
our food gonna last?

379
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:47,418
Not much longer.

380
00:23:47,547 --> 00:23:51,193
Because some of us
don't understand the concept of rationing.

381
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:53,334
Douglas, your house is behind this one.

382
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:55,170
When we finish this,
let's go for a food run.

383
00:23:55,235 --> 00:23:58,014
We'd never make it back.
What you don't understand is...

384
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:07,107
- Hey, Tom...
- We can't let anyone in.

385
00:24:07,172 --> 00:24:09,367
Okay, just calm down.

386
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:13,788
- Hello?
- Yes, hello.

387
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:15,538
- You're making a big mistake.
- Douglas.

388
00:24:15,603 --> 00:24:17,547
- Yes, hello.
- <i>Hello?</i>

389
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:21,288
<i>My name is Olympia.
I need help. Please.</i>

390
00:24:21,353 --> 00:24:23,678
- Don't open the goddamn...
- I'm gonna open the door.

391
00:24:23,743 --> 00:24:24,742
Fuck!

392
00:24:25,061 --> 00:24:26,531
Okay, one second.

393
00:24:27,478 --> 00:24:29,406
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey.

394
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,158
Move.

395
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,158
Go ahead.

396
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:39,346
Go ahead.

397
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,726
Go get a...
Go get a blanket. Go get a blanket.

398
00:24:43,478 --> 00:24:45,538
There should be two lamps
on either side of the door.

399
00:24:45,603 --> 00:24:48,823
I'm gonna hand you a blanket and I want
you to drape it across the both of them.

400
00:24:49,005 --> 00:24:50,109
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Okay?

401
00:24:50,174 --> 00:24:51,710
I need you to block the view for me.

402
00:24:51,853 --> 00:24:53,858
- Cover your eyes.
- So stupid.

403
00:24:53,936 --> 00:24:55,580
Malorie, cover your eyes.

404
00:25:00,478 --> 00:25:02,195
Here. Here. Okay.

405
00:25:02,395 --> 00:25:03,436
Okay.

406
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,163
Let me know when you have it.

407
00:25:10,645 --> 00:25:11,679
Tom, is this safe?

408
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:13,621
- Shut up.
- Hold on, please!

409
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:16,621
- Okay, it's all covered.
- Okay.

410
00:25:16,686 --> 00:25:18,202
I got you. Come on.

411
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,931
Hold on. Hold on.

412
00:25:21,618 --> 00:25:23,235
We're good.

413
00:25:24,728 --> 00:25:26,413
- Malorie.
- Yeah.

414
00:25:26,478 --> 00:25:27,882
- The gun, please.
- Yeah.

415
00:25:27,954 --> 00:25:32,392
Yeah, before you kill someone with it
since you have no idea how it works.

416
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,243
It's okay.

417
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:44,462
How...

418
00:25:44,895 --> 00:25:46,501
There are so many of you.

419
00:25:46,657 --> 00:25:48,329
So are you, um...

420
00:25:49,228 --> 00:25:51,288
Are... Are you pregnant?

421
00:25:51,728 --> 00:25:54,587
Yeah. October 1st.

422
00:25:55,769 --> 00:25:57,235
What about you?

423
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,371
Uh, end of, uh, September.

424
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:04,665
Wait. Hold on. Is shit
still going crazy out there or what?

425
00:26:04,853 --> 00:26:06,580
Are you on your own?

426
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:08,121
Yeah, I am.

427
00:26:08,186 --> 00:26:11,621
My husband was deployed last month
'cause he's in the Air Force.

428
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:14,554
I tried to make stuff last
as long as I could, um...

429
00:26:14,755 --> 00:26:18,246
but I was so hungry
and I was afraid I would starve my baby,

430
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:19,663
so I didn't know
what to do.

431
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:21,205
- Have some water.
- Thank you.

432
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,999
So you left and started knocking
on random doors?

433
00:26:24,064 --> 00:26:25,496
I only live a block away.

434
00:26:25,561 --> 00:26:29,470
Great, now we can all starve
here in the maternity ward.

435
00:26:30,103 --> 00:26:32,288
It just means we need
to get more supplies.

436
00:26:32,353 --> 00:26:34,746
Of course, but we can't get anything
if we can't see.

437
00:26:34,811 --> 00:26:36,804
Oh, we're so fucking trapped.

438
00:26:36,982 --> 00:26:38,306
Maybe not.

439
00:26:39,713 --> 00:26:41,796
Maybe we can see better
than we thought.

440
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,246
- What do you mean?
- Come here.

441
00:26:47,978 --> 00:26:51,071
We have cameras around the house
transmitting a live feed.

442
00:26:51,441 --> 00:26:53,946
Come upstairs. Come on.

443
00:26:58,266 --> 00:26:59,890
It's a digitized signal.

444
00:26:59,963 --> 00:27:03,374
It just shows the color temperatures
of the objects. It's neutered information.

445
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:06,195
- Colors on a flat screen.
- But an image can still have power.

446
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,366
We have no idea
how these things can operate.

447
00:27:08,431 --> 00:27:10,423
These images are not direct.

448
00:27:10,686 --> 00:27:12,960
We can't look at whatever it is
with the naked eye,

449
00:27:13,025 --> 00:27:15,509
but maybe we can
with a translator.

450
00:27:16,061 --> 00:27:17,163
Pixels and heat.

451
00:27:17,228 --> 00:27:18,273
Maybe it won't even show up.

452
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:22,782
Well, we're not gonna find out until
one of us takes a look.

453
00:27:23,353 --> 00:27:25,156
I think it's a huge mistake.

454
00:27:25,221 --> 00:27:28,304
You would, Douglas.
You think everything is a huge mistake.

455
00:27:28,436 --> 00:27:30,455
Sooner or later
we're gonna have to do something.

456
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,968
We don't know how long
we're gonna have electricity.

457
00:27:33,033 --> 00:27:35,538
You gotta trust me on this.
I really think this is gonna work.

458
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,945
Okay. Okay.

459
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,955
Maybe if it does, we could use
the technology for supply runs or...

460
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,041
Exactly.

461
00:27:42,158 --> 00:27:43,526
Just not too tight. Uh!

462
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:45,538
I hope you know
what you're doing.

463
00:27:45,603 --> 00:27:51,327
Listen... you and your husband,
you're good people.

464
00:27:51,392 --> 00:27:55,235
You know, it wasn't... It wasn't that.

465
00:27:55,561 --> 00:27:58,149
- Thank you, Douglas.
- Um.

466
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:01,226
You don't have to do this.

467
00:28:01,543 --> 00:28:04,163
I know. Don't worry.

468
00:28:05,728 --> 00:28:08,462
- Tom, I need the remote.
- Yeah.

469
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,187
There you go, bud.

470
00:28:40,024 --> 00:28:41,470
So why are you suing him?

471
00:28:41,548 --> 00:28:43,522
'Cause they want to tear down
this part of their house

472
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,733
and build some glass monstrosity.

473
00:28:45,853 --> 00:28:47,835
His husband's an architect.

474
00:28:47,923 --> 00:28:51,616
It's his property.
Why do you care what he builds?

475
00:28:52,395 --> 00:28:54,485
Because I have to look at it.

476
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,438
Not a chance.

477
00:29:26,964 --> 00:29:30,728
Well, the world's ending, baby,
so you never know.

478
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,688
- Uhh!
- Hmm.

479
00:29:38,267 --> 00:29:40,563
Where are you, motherfucker?

480
00:30:16,895 --> 00:30:18,274
<i>Come on, Greg.</i>

481
00:30:20,228 --> 00:30:21,392
<i>Focus.</i>

482
00:30:34,186 --> 00:30:37,509
It's, uh...
It's about the end of the world.

483
00:30:38,061 --> 00:30:39,345
My novel.

484
00:30:40,107 --> 00:30:43,371
But it's not one of those kids' stories
where they all got crossbows

485
00:30:43,436 --> 00:30:46,746
and they're killing each other to survive
or running around some giant maze.

486
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,782
- Mm-hmm.
- No, this story is, um...

487
00:30:50,311 --> 00:30:51,948
This story's gonna be real.

488
00:30:52,103 --> 00:30:55,251
Did you ever think
it was gonna be anything like this?

489
00:31:23,688 --> 00:31:25,269
Greg! Greg, can we come in?

490
00:31:25,334 --> 00:31:26,663
- What's going on?
- Greg!

491
00:31:26,728 --> 00:31:28,455
Greg, can we come in?

492
00:31:29,853 --> 00:31:31,186
Look away!

493
00:31:32,186 --> 00:31:34,496
Cover your eyes!
Cover your eyes. Find the monitor.

494
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,080
- Greg.
- Greg.

495
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,681
- Come on, Greg.
- Greg?

496
00:31:38,603 --> 00:31:40,871
- Shit.
- I've got it here.

497
00:31:42,853 --> 00:31:46,665
Okay! Okay! Okay!
You can open your eyes. You can see.

498
00:31:56,186 --> 00:31:58,766
I fucking told him that
it was a mistake.

499
00:31:58,891 --> 00:32:02,121
Come on.
We got to move. We got to move.

500
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:06,931
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Come on. We gotta go.

501
00:32:07,395 --> 00:32:09,415
We're never getting out of here.

502
00:32:09,686 --> 00:32:11,563
No one's coming for us.

503
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,907
No one's coming for...

504
00:32:14,589 --> 00:32:16,056
We need to go.

505
00:32:50,395 --> 00:32:51,479
Hi.

506
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:52,770
Hi.

507
00:32:52,853 --> 00:32:54,061
Yeah.

508
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:57,770
I thought it might be good for us
to be close considering...

509
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,120
Sure.

510
00:33:02,831 --> 00:33:04,996
You know,
this way, we won't be lonely.

511
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:07,913
I read this blog post once
about how pregnant women

512
00:33:07,978 --> 00:33:09,680
should always sleep
next to someone

513
00:33:09,745 --> 00:33:12,805
because the baby can sense
when the mother is lonely.

514
00:33:13,145 --> 00:33:14,721
Perfect.

515
00:33:15,811 --> 00:33:19,659
So, um...
have you thought about names yet?

516
00:33:20,311 --> 00:33:22,260
No, not yet.

517
00:33:23,061 --> 00:33:24,383
How about you?

518
00:33:25,228 --> 00:33:29,789
Well, if it's a girl we wanted
to name her, like, Ariel or Jasmine.

519
00:33:29,895 --> 00:33:34,565
I mean, I would love to name her
Cinderella and just call her Ella.

520
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:39,524
And
what did your husband like?

521
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:41,424
He loves everything I love.

522
00:33:43,728 --> 00:33:46,517
What about you?
Does your husband have a favorite?

523
00:33:47,103 --> 00:33:48,579
Oh, it's just me.

524
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:52,251
- Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine. It's fine.

525
00:33:52,645 --> 00:33:55,133
Well, what about your family?
They must be excited...

526
00:33:55,198 --> 00:33:58,396
Do you know what?
Could you just excuse me for one second?

527
00:33:58,461 --> 00:33:59,813
I'll be right back.

528
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:55,470
Sorry.

529
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:01,017
That's something
you can't unsee.

530
00:35:01,561 --> 00:35:04,376
Ah, no. No, you cannot.

531
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:06,243
Yeah.

532
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,103
Sorry.

533
00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:10,259
Shh.

534
00:35:10,724 --> 00:35:13,610
- Shh, shh.
- Hmm.

535
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,547
Are you okay?

536
00:35:21,811 --> 00:35:22,936
Yeah.

537
00:35:24,228 --> 00:35:26,659
I'll wait to do my laundry in the morning.

538
00:35:27,286 --> 00:35:29,371
- That's probably a good idea.
- Yeah, I think so.

539
00:35:29,436 --> 00:35:30,876
Good night.

540
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:05,649
<i>Hello!</i>

541
00:36:06,657 --> 00:36:08,462
<i>You guys need some help?</i>

542
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:14,759
- <i>It's okay to take your blindfolds off.</i>
- Do not take your blindfolds off. Do not!

543
00:36:15,233 --> 00:36:18,496
<i>I got some food.
Those kids look hungry.</i>

544
00:36:18,561 --> 00:36:21,259
Get down! Get down! Get down!
Down. Down. Down.

545
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:32,485
<i>Hey, little buddies.</i>

546
00:36:32,853 --> 00:36:35,282
<i>Have you ever seen a baby deer?</i>

547
00:36:35,901 --> 00:36:37,873
<i>I'll tell you a secret.</i>

548
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,280
<i>I found one in the woods.</i>

549
00:36:47,436 --> 00:36:51,420
<i>Okay. I know you're scared.
Well, listen, there's no need.</i>

550
00:36:56,043 --> 00:36:58,459
<i>I'm not here to hurt you.
I can pull you to shore.</i>

551
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:10,705
Take your goddamn blindfold off!

552
00:37:12,811 --> 00:37:14,068
Ah!

553
00:37:23,728 --> 00:37:27,086
I've seen one. I've seen the truth.

554
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:30,228
Take your blindfold off.

555
00:37:31,076 --> 00:37:35,563
It's beautiful. It's beautiful.
Take your blindfold off.

556
00:37:39,353 --> 00:37:41,657
Take your blindfold off!

557
00:37:53,978 --> 00:37:57,121
<i>It shall cleanse the world!</i>

558
00:37:57,186 --> 00:37:59,064
<i>Everyone must look.</i>

559
00:37:59,145 --> 00:38:01,458
Everyone must look.

560
00:38:11,704 --> 00:38:13,422
<i>Got some bad news.</i>

561
00:38:14,394 --> 00:38:17,288
All right. We're running out of food
and there's no help coming.

562
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:19,256
We've got to get outside.

563
00:38:22,103 --> 00:38:24,978
Look, I-I-I might know
where we can get more.

564
00:38:25,228 --> 00:38:27,603
- Where, Charlie?
- The Fields market.

565
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:30,806
I locked the place up
when everything started going crazy.

566
00:38:30,871 --> 00:38:34,509
- You're just telling us this?
- At least we know now. Thank you.

567
00:38:34,574 --> 00:38:37,157
Okay, so we'll need
a group of us to go.

568
00:38:37,222 --> 00:38:39,314
Whoa. We'll be dead
before we get there.

569
00:38:39,379 --> 00:38:41,040
- Are you kidding me?
- I'll go.

570
00:38:41,105 --> 00:38:43,150
- Well, if he's going, I'm going.
- You're pregnant!

571
00:38:43,215 --> 00:38:46,618
Well, if all you guys are going,
then I can come too.

572
00:38:46,683 --> 00:38:51,038
Why don't I go on the first run
and then you can go on the second run?

573
00:38:51,103 --> 00:38:52,571
- I'll come.
- What?

574
00:38:52,636 --> 00:38:54,845
- It's a death wish.
- I have the training. It'll be fine.

575
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:57,931
I don't like this.
I don't think anyone should go.

576
00:38:57,996 --> 00:39:00,400
- So. there are four of us.
- Five. Charlie's going.

577
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:02,634
Charlie's going?
Charlie ain't going nowhere.

578
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:05,048
- You know the security system.
- No chance I'm going.

579
00:39:05,113 --> 00:39:07,118
Okay. I gave you the information.
That's all you needed from me.

580
00:39:07,183 --> 00:39:09,696
You don't need me to tell you
where to go. It is a supermarket.

581
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:12,017
They got signs.
You've been shopping before.

582
00:39:12,082 --> 00:39:13,868
You wanna get cereal,
the sign will say cereals.

583
00:39:13,933 --> 00:39:16,316
If you can't read, I get it,
but you can read. It's a....

584
00:39:16,394 --> 00:39:17,394
- No,no. No.

585
00:39:17,472 --> 00:39:19,354
- You don't need me to go with you...
- Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,

586
00:39:19,432 --> 00:39:20,900
It'll be research for the book.

587
00:39:20,979 --> 00:39:23,040
Okay? Be awesome.

588
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:30,056
All right, so the idea is
if we can black out all the windows,

589
00:39:30,129 --> 00:39:31,963
it's efficient and it's safe.

590
00:39:32,032 --> 00:39:33,892
Is anybody else hearing this?

591
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,871
How is driving blind safer?

592
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,996
We're not.

593
00:39:37,161 --> 00:39:39,032
We've got the GPS.

594
00:40:04,311 --> 00:40:06,001
<i>Calculating route.</i>

595
00:40:29,384 --> 00:40:31,696
<i>Continue straight.</i>

596
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:39,134
<i>In half a mile,
turn right onto Bay Street.</i>

597
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,330
- What is that?
- It's a curb.

598
00:40:41,508 --> 00:40:42,992
It's just a curb.

599
00:40:47,895 --> 00:40:50,574
It's a proximity sensor.

600
00:41:02,603 --> 00:41:05,368
Just a speed bump.
It's just a speed bump.

601
00:41:08,187 --> 00:41:09,919
<i>Turn right here.</i>

602
00:41:28,388 --> 00:41:30,622
- Are we off the road?
- No, there's something.

603
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:33,996
- I think it must be just a truck.
- Just go around.

604
00:41:34,061 --> 00:41:36,466
- Keep going around it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

605
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,089
What was that?

606
00:41:50,145 --> 00:41:52,096
Is somebody else driving out there?

607
00:42:03,478 --> 00:42:05,996
- Charlie, breathe.
- Shit! Fuck this shit.

608
00:42:06,061 --> 00:42:07,996
- Get the fuck out!
- Charlie! Calm down.

609
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:10,087
Guys, stop touching him.
Stop touching him.

610
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:12,191
- Look at me. Look at me...
- Shut him up. - ..down.

611
00:42:12,269 --> 00:42:13,489
You have to be quiet.

612
00:42:23,436 --> 00:42:25,228
Ah. Ah!

613
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:27,466
Fuck! We're not gonna make it.

614
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,565
Calm down. Calm down.

615
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,411
- Oh, shit!
- Everybody, hold on.

616
00:42:34,497 --> 00:42:36,575
Hold on to something. Gonna move!

617
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:38,530
Ah!

618
00:42:38,692 --> 00:42:39,802
Hold on!

619
00:42:39,981 --> 00:42:41,622
That's not a fucking speed bump!

620
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,798
- Fuck, it's stuck.
- Hold on.

621
00:42:44,489 --> 00:42:47,528
- <i>Turn left here.</i>
- Slow down! Slow down!

622
00:42:53,978 --> 00:42:55,647
You have arrived.

623
00:42:57,603 --> 00:42:59,038
What the fuck?

624
00:42:59,103 --> 00:43:01,919
And after all this,
we're supposed to get out now?

625
00:43:02,251 --> 00:43:03,661
Lucky us.

626
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,705
- On three. One...
- I'm ready now.

627
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:12,154
two, three.

628
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,816
What was that? Wh-What...
What did I just hit?

629
00:43:14,881 --> 00:43:17,200
- What did I just hit?
- Th-Th-That's just a pillar.

630
00:43:19,352 --> 00:43:21,035
Okay. Where's the...
door?

631
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,863
The door should be right.
Just a couple of paces up, man.

632
00:43:24,022 --> 00:43:25,455
- I'm lost.
- Towards your left.

633
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,080
Left. Left. I'm lost.

634
00:43:28,145 --> 00:43:30,330
- Come on, you guys.
- I'm lost.

635
00:43:30,395 --> 00:43:32,788
- Oh, here. Here.
- Okay. Okay.

636
00:43:32,853 --> 00:43:34,038
- You're in?
- No.

637
00:43:34,103 --> 00:43:35,856
Okay. Wait. Almost got it.

638
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,341
Okay, I got it.

639
00:43:38,978 --> 00:43:40,114
Go on.

640
00:43:47,145 --> 00:43:48,763
All right. We're in.

641
00:43:50,436 --> 00:43:52,552
- Hello!
- Shh! Shh!

642
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,770
I'll check the windows.

643
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,958
Here we go. Here we go.

644
00:44:07,817 --> 00:44:11,047
All right, I think we're clear.
You can take 'em off.

645
00:44:15,262 --> 00:44:16,822
Oh, my God.

646
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:19,877
- Jack-fucking-pot.
- Yeah.

647
00:44:20,811 --> 00:44:22,538
- Where are the canned goods?
- Aisle two.

648
00:44:22,603 --> 00:44:24,127
- Toilet paper?
- Five.

649
00:44:24,192 --> 00:44:26,565
- Fuck that. Where's the booze?
- It's in seven.

650
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:30,619
Let's not forget. We have limited space.
Stick to non-perishables, the necessities.

651
00:44:30,684 --> 00:44:32,611
- Where are the electronics?
- Go to six.

652
00:44:32,676 --> 00:44:34,553
- Six. Thank you.
- All right. Cool.

653
00:44:34,828 --> 00:44:36,778
I'm not cleaning this shit up.

654
00:44:39,064 --> 00:44:40,427
Sweet.

655
00:44:47,145 --> 00:44:49,342
Boy, I'm glad I tagged along.

656
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:53,115
This is truly
the happiest place on Earth.

657
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:55,700
I know. You're not kidding!

658
00:45:00,569 --> 00:45:04,529
It's, uh... my baby shower gift to you.

659
00:45:06,321 --> 00:45:07,496
Why, thank you.

660
00:45:07,561 --> 00:45:08,770
Yeah.

661
00:45:08,853 --> 00:45:12,334
So, my sister is
expecting her fourth, so...

662
00:45:12,493 --> 00:45:15,080
Oh, my God. She's a saint.

663
00:45:15,165 --> 00:45:16,647
Yeah, she is.

664
00:45:17,392 --> 00:45:19,928
And I'm always touching her belly.

665
00:45:20,728 --> 00:45:22,022
It's calming.

666
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:25,217
Yeah, it's nature's dirty little trick.

667
00:45:28,728 --> 00:45:31,006
Is your sister in Sacramento?

668
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,413
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

669
00:45:33,478 --> 00:45:34,615
Yeah.

670
00:45:39,584 --> 00:45:42,740
What about you? Where did you...
Where did you grow up?

671
00:45:42,805 --> 00:45:44,326
Oh, just outside of Stockton.

672
00:45:44,391 --> 00:45:45,705
- Stockton.
- Yeah.

673
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:48,193
- We raised horses.
- On a real ranch?

674
00:45:48,399 --> 00:45:52,506
- Well, my daddy was a real cowboy.
- That's... That's how you learned your...

675
00:45:52,571 --> 00:45:53,897
- What?
- little shotgun trick.

676
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:56,163
Yeah.
I had an interesting childhood.

677
00:45:56,228 --> 00:45:57,391
Hmm.

678
00:45:57,899 --> 00:46:01,419
Ah, but Stockton wasn't
all that far from Sacramento.

679
00:46:01,484 --> 00:46:03,538
No. Just down 99.

680
00:46:03,603 --> 00:46:06,536
- Just down Highway 99.
- Worlds apart, right?

681
00:46:07,436 --> 00:46:10,372
Still we could've met
some other way.

682
00:46:11,152 --> 00:46:12,414
Sure.

683
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,490
Could have been your babysitter.

684
00:46:17,186 --> 00:46:19,021
My hot babysitter.

685
00:46:22,126 --> 00:46:26,403
You're... You're only saying that
'cause we're all gonna die.

686
00:46:27,561 --> 00:46:28,890
Possibly.

687
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,138
How did you guys get so lucky?

688
00:47:09,235 --> 00:47:10,500
Huh?

689
00:47:11,811 --> 00:47:13,171
Hi.

690
00:47:14,978 --> 00:47:16,562
Hi, there.

691
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,257
So sleepy.

692
00:47:22,895 --> 00:47:27,435
Attention, all shoppers,
come to aisle seven, please.

693
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,411
I have a big, big, big, big, big
announcement to make.

694
00:47:31,523 --> 00:47:34,669
- Ladies and gentlemen, please...
- Yes, Douglas.

695
00:47:34,863 --> 00:47:40,958
I would like to take this opportunity
to make a toast to all of us...

696
00:47:41,382 --> 00:47:48,591
because all of us, collectively,
are making the end of the world...

697
00:47:51,523 --> 00:47:55,335
great again! Yeah!

698
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:00,983
Birdies.

699
00:48:02,398 --> 00:48:06,028
I mean, don't you doofuses get it?

700
00:48:06,353 --> 00:48:08,905
Uh, we could just stay here.

701
00:48:09,007 --> 00:48:14,286
We have a year's supply
of food and drink right here.

702
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:17,622
We don't ever have to pay
and we shouldn't ever leave.

703
00:48:17,687 --> 00:48:20,038
And what are they gonna
do at Greg's? Starve?

704
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,648
Better them than us.

705
00:48:24,186 --> 00:48:27,583
We have everything we need to live here.
Everything.

706
00:48:27,648 --> 00:48:33,871
There is no statistical, logical, or legal
argument for trying to get back there.

707
00:48:33,936 --> 00:48:37,210
Here's an argument:
we're not assholes.

708
00:48:39,311 --> 00:48:40,944
And we're not staying.

709
00:48:49,853 --> 00:48:50,974
What is it?

710
00:48:55,728 --> 00:48:58,955
- Somebody let me out of here.
- Charlie, what's behind there?

711
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,450
It's a loading dock.

712
00:49:00,811 --> 00:49:02,077
Hello?

713
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:05,349
Please let me in.

714
00:49:06,186 --> 00:49:07,705
Speak up, I can't hear you.

715
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:10,796
Please let me in.

716
00:49:11,566 --> 00:49:12,587
Cover your eyes.

717
00:49:12,652 --> 00:49:14,251
- What?
- I'm gonna open the door.

718
00:49:14,316 --> 00:49:16,439
- No.
- There's a person out there.

719
00:49:16,504 --> 00:49:18,189
I have to open the door.

720
00:49:20,436 --> 00:49:22,853
Okay.

721
00:49:22,936 --> 00:49:24,121
Okay. Uh...

722
00:49:24,571 --> 00:49:25,797
Okay.

723
00:49:29,103 --> 00:49:30,866
- Hello?
- Hello.

724
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:33,675
Please let me in. I'm trapped.

725
00:49:33,827 --> 00:49:36,753
Wait, wait, wait. Is that...
Fish Fingers, is that you?

726
00:49:36,905 --> 00:49:39,746
- Charlie, Charlie, yeah, it's me.
- Who's Fish Fingers, Charlie?

727
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:43,089
He works here at the supermarket with me.
He works in the seafood department.

728
00:49:43,154 --> 00:49:46,324
He's been to prison and he's a bit crazy,
but he's always nice to me.

729
00:49:46,476 --> 00:49:48,769
- How did you get there, man?
- I got... I got...

730
00:49:48,905 --> 00:49:50,483
Th-Th-They tricked me!

731
00:49:50,624 --> 00:49:51,777
Who's they?

732
00:49:51,842 --> 00:49:53,496
Who you talking about?
Are you there alone?

733
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:55,574
They tricked me
and they left me to rot here.

734
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:57,705
Who left you to rot?
What are you talking about?

735
00:49:57,873 --> 00:49:59,788
You guys,
there's something wrong.

736
00:49:59,853 --> 00:50:01,582
There's something wrong!

737
00:50:01,647 --> 00:50:03,925
- Please let me in. I'm trapped.
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

738
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:06,733
What are you doin', Fish Fingers?
What are you doing, man?

739
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,210
Look at it!
It wants you to see it! Let me in!

740
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:16,748
He's too strong. I can't hold him.

741
00:50:16,944 --> 00:50:18,820
- I can't hold him.
- Let me in!

742
00:50:18,898 --> 00:50:20,023
Shit!

743
00:50:21,728 --> 00:50:23,413
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

744
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:24,770
Fuck! Ah!

745
00:50:24,853 --> 00:50:26,466
Charlie, wait!

746
00:50:29,395 --> 00:50:31,871
Look at it, Charlie. It's beautiful.

747
00:50:31,936 --> 00:50:34,411
- Charlie?
- Charlie!

748
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:37,580
- Charlie!
- Charlie!

749
00:50:37,645 --> 00:50:39,902
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, fuck.

750
00:50:39,967 --> 00:50:42,153
Ohhhh! Ohhhh!

751
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:43,812
Fuck!

752
00:50:46,779 --> 00:50:48,138
We gotta go.

753
00:50:49,603 --> 00:50:51,455
We gotta move. Come on. Let's go.

754
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,989
Let's get out of here.

755
00:50:56,728 --> 00:50:59,746
Please. Please let me in.

756
00:50:59,811 --> 00:51:01,871
How is that guy alive in there?

757
00:51:02,277 --> 00:51:04,489
Please let me in.

758
00:51:27,728 --> 00:51:29,481
Hi, Felix!

759
00:51:30,308 --> 00:51:33,424
Oh, my God. Look at all this stuff.

760
00:51:33,728 --> 00:51:35,871
- Birdies?
- Yeah, they, uh...

761
00:51:35,936 --> 00:51:38,955
They seem to sense
when the creatures are around.

762
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,724
Where's Charlie?

763
00:51:42,353 --> 00:51:45,080
Another novel I won't have to read.

764
00:51:45,158 --> 00:51:48,427
He saved us, you fucking asshole.

765
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:11,886
I know what you think of me,
what everybody thinks of me.

766
00:52:11,951 --> 00:52:14,270
You know, in the divorce petition...

767
00:52:14,936 --> 00:52:21,161
my first wife said that to call me a creep
would be an affront to creeps everywhere.

768
00:52:22,061 --> 00:52:25,243
My second wife said
she no longer feared going to hell,

769
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,619
'cause it couldn't possibly be worse
than being married to me.

770
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,413
Think I would have loved them.

771
00:52:30,513 --> 00:52:31,801
Maybe.

772
00:52:31,879 --> 00:52:33,307
And then Lydia.

773
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:37,231
Third time really
was the charm for me.

774
00:52:38,395 --> 00:52:41,005
She was the kindest person
I ever met.

775
00:52:41,561 --> 00:52:44,455
But I'm here and she's gone.
You know why that is?

776
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:47,111
Because, in the end,
there are only two types of people.

777
00:52:47,176 --> 00:52:48,913
The assholes and the dead.

778
00:52:48,978 --> 00:52:51,650
God, you sound like my father.

779
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:53,251
Like your father? Why?

780
00:52:53,316 --> 00:52:58,573
Was he a towering intellect given
to dispensing wisdom to undeserving fools?

781
00:52:58,638 --> 00:53:00,903
Yes, he was fluent in asshole
as well.

782
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:06,619
And just like you, he blamed
everything he did on some deeper meaning,

783
00:53:06,811 --> 00:53:09,388
convoluted conspiracy theories and...

784
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,923
how it was everybody else's fault
when he was clearly in the wrong.

785
00:53:12,988 --> 00:53:16,564
But, you know, once my sister and I
realized it was just an excuse

786
00:53:16,629 --> 00:53:20,181
to treat his family like shit,
it made life a little easier.

787
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:23,310
You know what though?
I see one difference between us.

788
00:53:24,184 --> 00:53:25,184
Hmm?

789
00:53:25,311 --> 00:53:26,611
I'm never wrong.

790
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:28,035
You are...

791
00:53:28,268 --> 00:53:29,962
You're two pricks in a pod.

792
00:53:30,576 --> 00:53:32,697
Do I look like him
as well?

793
00:53:32,936 --> 00:53:34,122
Mm...

794
00:53:34,826 --> 00:53:36,423
Not really.

795
00:53:36,927 --> 00:53:40,970
- He wasn't exquisitely handsome?
- It's not that, it's just...

796
00:53:42,145 --> 00:53:44,126
the hair... the hair is different.

797
00:53:44,311 --> 00:53:45,942
- The hair?
- Yeah.

798
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:48,189
He had some.

799
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:49,606
Oh.

800
00:53:57,956 --> 00:54:00,059
Oh, I can't.

801
00:54:00,124 --> 00:54:02,572
Oh, come on,
the world is ending.

802
00:54:02,728 --> 00:54:07,129
I really don't think a quarter-ounce
of whiskey's gonna tip the scales, do you?

803
00:54:10,145 --> 00:54:11,374
Well...

804
00:54:12,232 --> 00:54:13,840
I hope you're wrong.

805
00:54:14,802 --> 00:54:16,856
About the assholes and the dead.

806
00:54:18,832 --> 00:54:20,528
I hope there is more.

807
00:54:21,895 --> 00:54:24,622
Here's to hoping
there is more.

808
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,185
- Close the garage.
- I've got it.

809
00:54:50,436 --> 00:54:51,871
Wait. Wait. Wait.

810
00:54:51,981 --> 00:54:53,520
- Cover your eyes.
- Yeah.

811
00:54:53,645 --> 00:54:56,661
Okay, okay, okay.
It's closed. It's closed.

812
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,489
Sons of bitches.

813
00:55:00,228 --> 00:55:02,038
Where's the goddamn car?

814
00:55:02,103 --> 00:55:04,458
You guys.
You guys, where are Lucy and Felix?

815
00:55:13,103 --> 00:55:14,452
Fuck.

816
00:55:43,186 --> 00:55:44,879
You stopped rowing.

817
00:55:45,228 --> 00:55:47,043
I'm just taking a break.

818
00:55:47,853 --> 00:55:49,413
How much longer?

819
00:55:49,623 --> 00:55:51,356
A few hours.

820
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,360
Ah!

821
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:16,645
Malorie!

822
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,209
Malorie! Malorie!

823
00:56:20,287 --> 00:56:21,615
Help!

824
00:56:22,584 --> 00:56:23,957
Malorie!

825
00:56:29,606 --> 00:56:31,580
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- Yes.

826
00:56:31,645 --> 00:56:34,988
- I'm cold.
- I know. I know you're cold. Hold on.

827
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:42,121
No, no, no, no, no, no.
All the food and blankets. God damn it!

828
00:56:43,061 --> 00:56:44,913
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, it's...

829
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:46,410
Hold on.

830
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,707
Okay. All right.

831
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:51,730
- Okay.
- I'm so cold.

832
00:56:51,902 --> 00:56:55,504
We're gonna get you warmed up, okay?
We're gonna get you warmed up.

833
00:56:56,603 --> 00:56:58,715
Put this around you.

834
00:56:58,853 --> 00:57:01,355
Keep your blindfolds on. Stay tight.

835
00:57:04,853 --> 00:57:06,413
Did you hear that?

836
00:57:06,685 --> 00:57:08,043
Did you hear that?

837
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:20,830
Lay down on the bottom of the boat.
Lay down, really flat.

838
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,330
I need you to be quiet.
I'm gonna leave the birds with you.

839
00:57:23,395 --> 00:57:26,330
I'm gonna cover you up, but do not
make a sound and do not leave this boat.

840
00:57:26,395 --> 00:57:28,520
Understand? Do not leave this boat!

841
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,598
Shit.

842
01:00:49,478 --> 01:00:51,186
<i>Malorie.</i>

843
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:53,020
<i>Malorie.</i>

844
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,436
<i>Malorie.</i>

845
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:09,621
Something is wrong with Malorie.

846
01:01:09,686 --> 01:01:11,936
<i>Malorie.</i>

847
01:01:12,441 --> 01:01:14,038
Ah! Ah!

848
01:01:46,561 --> 01:01:47,904
Malorie?

849
01:01:53,311 --> 01:01:54,563
Malorie?

850
01:01:58,826 --> 01:02:00,576
Malorie?

851
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:09,705
I told you to stay on the boat.

852
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:10,824
You don't think.

853
01:02:10,889 --> 01:02:13,704
You do exactly what I say or you die,
do you understand me?

854
01:02:13,769 --> 01:02:16,329
If something happens to me,
do not try and help me.

855
01:02:16,394 --> 01:02:18,079
Forget about me and
try to save yourself.

856
01:02:18,144 --> 01:02:19,455
Do you understand?

857
01:02:19,605 --> 01:02:22,621
Say it! If something happens to me,
what do you do?

858
01:02:22,686 --> 01:02:25,415
You save yourself. Say it!

859
01:02:25,686 --> 01:02:28,276
- I save myself.
- You save yourself.

860
01:02:29,308 --> 01:02:31,331
I can't trust you.

861
01:02:49,353 --> 01:02:53,462
The end of the world
makes us do things.

862
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:56,663
- It's not the end of the world.
- Really?

863
01:02:57,311 --> 01:02:59,165
It sure feels like it.

864
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:08,775
At the end of my deployment in Iraq,
we were stationed at this village...

865
01:03:10,311 --> 01:03:14,110
ordered to patrol the streets,
make sure everybody was safe.

866
01:03:15,908 --> 01:03:17,501
One morning, we saw...

867
01:03:18,186 --> 01:03:20,830
this father walking with his four kids.

868
01:03:20,949 --> 01:03:23,642
So I pulled over to make sure
everything was okay

869
01:03:23,707 --> 01:03:26,173
and to make sure he got
wherever he was going safely.

870
01:03:28,936 --> 01:03:31,735
Come to find out,
he was walking his kids to school.

871
01:03:33,353 --> 01:03:36,407
In the middle of all that shit,

872
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:39,243
all that chaos,
he was walking his kids to school.

873
01:03:46,103 --> 01:03:47,402
So...

874
01:03:50,561 --> 01:03:52,321
So we just followed him.

875
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,009
Day after day.

876
01:03:55,228 --> 01:03:56,626
We escorted him.

877
01:03:59,728 --> 01:04:01,642
That just became our routine.

878
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:06,439
And then, at the end of our time,

879
01:04:06,504 --> 01:04:10,439
he gave me this
when it was time to come back home.

880
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:17,769
Mm.

881
01:04:23,603 --> 01:04:26,892
I like to think he's still
walking his kids to school.

882
01:05:07,154 --> 01:05:09,246
Hello, can anybody hear me? Hello?

883
01:05:09,311 --> 01:05:12,329
This is Malorie.
Anybody, can you hear me? Hello?

884
01:05:15,028 --> 01:05:18,720
Can anybody hear me? Hello?
Hello? Can anybody hear me?

885
01:05:20,728 --> 01:05:22,988
Hello? Testing, hello?

886
01:05:24,978 --> 01:05:27,204
Hello, is anyone out there? Hello?

887
01:05:27,811 --> 01:05:29,918
Can you hear me, please?

888
01:05:29,983 --> 01:05:32,246
- Hello? Hello? Testing.
- Are you a...

889
01:05:32,311 --> 01:05:33,964
Do you have a blindfold on?

890
01:05:34,145 --> 01:05:37,413
You do.
Is... Is the blanket behind you still up?

891
01:05:37,478 --> 01:05:39,561
Ah...

892
01:05:39,645 --> 01:05:42,038
Okay, just come in really, really quickly.

893
01:05:42,103 --> 01:05:45,996
Thank you. Here's my blindfold.
Thank you so much. - Ok, Ok.

894
01:05:46,061 --> 01:05:49,163
It's okay. Just wait. Wait here. Malorie!

895
01:05:49,228 --> 01:05:50,996
- I gotta pee.
- Olympia, what are you doing?

896
01:05:51,061 --> 01:05:52,330
- Malorie!
- What are you doing?

897
01:05:52,395 --> 01:05:56,205
- What are you thinking? Get down!
- Okay, he's just scared.

898
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:58,246
- He's just scared.
- Tom. Check the bag.

899
01:05:58,311 --> 01:06:00,830
Get over here, Olympia. Get over here.

900
01:06:00,895 --> 01:06:02,538
- Who are you?
- Who is this guy?

901
01:06:02,603 --> 01:06:05,228
Tom, I've got him. Check the bag.
Check the bag.

902
01:06:05,436 --> 01:06:06,830
- Who is this?
- He's just scared.

903
01:06:06,895 --> 01:06:08,560
- Who are you?
- How did he get in here?

904
01:06:08,625 --> 01:06:12,076
- Shut up, Olympia. Who are you?
- He was scared, okay? I just let him in.

905
01:06:12,141 --> 01:06:14,455
- You let a stranger in the house!
- I'm sorry.

906
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,615
- He was terrified!
- Are you a simpleton?

907
01:06:16,728 --> 01:06:18,935
Oh, God. Okay. Please.

908
01:06:19,005 --> 01:06:20,446
My name is Gary.

909
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:22,521
I live in the city.

910
01:06:22,686 --> 01:06:25,712
When these things came, I got
the first train out with some colleagues

911
01:06:25,777 --> 01:06:27,665
because we thought it would be safe.

912
01:06:29,603 --> 01:06:34,279
Please, please just let me stay here.
They're after me.

913
01:06:34,395 --> 01:06:35,712
Who's after you?

914
01:06:36,275 --> 01:06:38,506
- I don't believe it. He's lying.
- Who's after you?

915
01:06:38,571 --> 01:06:40,123
It's obvious he's lying.

916
01:06:40,188 --> 01:06:41,310
- I swear.
- Why are you here?

917
01:06:41,375 --> 01:06:45,205
We went
to my colleague Carl's house to lay low.

918
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:49,478
Everything was fine
until they broke in.

919
01:06:50,311 --> 01:06:52,013
Creatures don't break into people's homes.

920
01:06:52,078 --> 01:06:54,618
No, not the creatures,
these psychos.

921
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:58,298
These psychos from Northwood.

922
01:06:58,592 --> 01:07:00,824
Northwood?
I don't... Where is that?

923
01:07:00,889 --> 01:07:03,675
It's a mental institution
for the criminally insane.

924
01:07:03,803 --> 01:07:06,964
Well, it's nice to know
they have hall passes now.

925
01:07:07,478 --> 01:07:08,542
And then what?

926
01:07:08,607 --> 01:07:12,830
They took us outside
and they forced our eyes open

927
01:07:12,912 --> 01:07:15,660
so that we would have
to look at the creatures.

928
01:07:16,811 --> 01:07:17,936
What?

929
01:07:18,865 --> 01:07:20,830
- Did you look?
- No.

930
01:07:20,895 --> 01:07:26,743
Somehow, my friend Carl managed to tackle
one of these people to the ground

931
01:07:26,808 --> 01:07:29,355
and the rest of us
made a run for it.

932
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:32,941
I just kept on running
and running and running till I got here.

933
01:07:33,561 --> 01:07:37,205
I've been knocking on
all the doors and nobody answered.

934
01:07:38,728 --> 01:07:40,831
Until you did, so...

935
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:43,951
Thank you.

936
01:07:54,228 --> 01:07:55,495
Birds.

937
01:07:56,451 --> 01:08:01,878
The scariest thing was, uh...
when these people broke in, they...

938
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:05,917
they weren't wearing blindfolds.

939
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:09,050
It's like they didn't need them.

940
01:08:09,115 --> 01:08:11,331
But they'd been outside.
You have to wear blindfolds.

941
01:08:11,396 --> 01:08:13,050
Not these people.

942
01:08:13,686 --> 01:08:16,753
These crazy guys
weren't affected like everyone else.

943
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,628
They wanted to see.

944
01:08:19,029 --> 01:08:20,410
They were happy.

945
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:23,636
They were so glad.

946
01:08:24,978 --> 01:08:28,823
And they said
everyone needed to see.

947
01:08:32,693 --> 01:08:34,024
Wait.

948
01:08:34,102 --> 01:08:37,113
Get up and get out.
It's not an orphanage.

949
01:08:37,186 --> 01:08:41,964
New guy, you had a great visit.
We really loved meeting you. Now fuck off.

950
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:46,302
And anybody who doesn't agree,
you go with him.

951
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:48,371
- Out now!
- Douglas, that is murder.

952
01:08:48,436 --> 01:08:49,948
No. This is murder.

953
01:08:50,013 --> 01:08:53,221
- Please.
- Letting strangers into this house.

954
01:08:53,286 --> 01:08:58,511
Every contact we have had
with the outside has brought us death.

955
01:08:58,589 --> 01:09:00,573
Lydia, Greg, Charlie.

956
01:09:00,638 --> 01:09:02,596
If you wanna save people out there,

957
01:09:02,661 --> 01:09:05,377
then you go right through that door
and you go do it.

958
01:09:05,442 --> 01:09:08,432
We're not bringing
any more strangers in here.

959
01:09:08,517 --> 01:09:09,869
Not while I'm alive.

960
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:13,268
I won't tell you again,
get up and get...

961
01:09:21,512 --> 01:09:22,846
Thank you.

962
01:09:23,645 --> 01:09:25,413
You'll sleep in the garage.

963
01:09:35,192 --> 01:09:37,463
The only reason I opened that door

964
01:09:37,528 --> 01:09:40,237
is 'cause I remember
what it felt like to be outside of it.

965
01:09:40,853 --> 01:09:43,229
If you guys hadn't let me in, I...

966
01:09:43,853 --> 01:09:45,955
I feel like such a burden.

967
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:48,752
You are no more a burden
than I am, okay?

968
01:09:48,817 --> 01:09:50,394
- That's not true.
- It is. It is.

969
01:09:50,472 --> 01:09:52,393
You're not soft like me.

970
01:09:52,811 --> 01:09:55,776
I'm so spoiled.

971
01:09:56,142 --> 01:10:00,565
My parents have always done
everything for me and then my husband,

972
01:10:00,643 --> 01:10:04,292
and I just...
I got soft from all that love.

973
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:08,987
Well, I was raised by wolves,
so consider yourself lucky.

974
01:10:11,978 --> 01:10:17,677
If something happens to me,
I want you to take care of my baby.

975
01:10:17,895 --> 01:10:19,039
Okay?

976
01:10:19,311 --> 01:10:20,580
- No. No.
- Please.

977
01:10:20,645 --> 01:10:21,955
- It's your baby.
- Malorie.

978
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:23,351
No.

979
01:10:23,429 --> 01:10:25,366
- Promise me.
- Nothing is gonna happen to you.

980
01:10:25,431 --> 01:10:26,475
It's your baby.

981
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:27,577
- Promise me.
- Nothing...

982
01:10:27,642 --> 01:10:29,450
Please promise me.

983
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:34,800
Yeah, okay. Yeah, of course.

984
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,104
What is this?

985
01:10:43,853 --> 01:10:45,866
Well, if I was just gonna tell you,

986
01:10:45,931 --> 01:10:50,452
I wouldn't have bothered
putting it in this fancy... this fancy bag.

987
01:10:54,777 --> 01:10:56,807
I got it on the supply run.

988
01:11:00,645 --> 01:11:03,104
- It's so cute.
- Mm-hmm.

989
01:11:04,186 --> 01:11:06,323
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

990
01:11:10,608 --> 01:11:13,121
I know it's not the baby shower
you've always dreamt of.

991
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:16,092
No, it's... It's perfect.

992
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:20,932
And you can give it to your little one
when she's old enough, okay?

993
01:11:23,858 --> 01:11:25,307
Thank you.

994
01:11:41,811 --> 01:11:44,940
You guys, the river's speeding up.
It's time for a meeting.

995
01:11:59,478 --> 01:12:01,831
I need to talk to you about the rapids.

996
01:12:02,316 --> 01:12:04,863
The rapids are
where the water gets very bumpy.

997
01:12:04,936 --> 01:12:07,955
It's very loud. It's very dangerous,

998
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:11,308
and it's gonna be
the hardest thing we have ever done.

999
01:12:12,145 --> 01:12:17,652
And when we reach them, one of you
is gonna have a very important job.

1000
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:21,862
One of you is gonna have to look.

1001
01:12:24,145 --> 01:12:27,503
And the person who looks,

1002
01:12:28,228 --> 01:12:31,121
they have to tell me
which direction to steer into

1003
01:12:31,186 --> 01:12:33,706
so that I go the right way.

1004
01:12:34,436 --> 01:12:37,612
Because if I look, we won't make it.

1005
01:12:40,903 --> 01:12:43,136
What if we see something?

1006
01:12:43,561 --> 01:12:45,417
- I'll do it.
- No, no, no, no.

1007
01:12:45,482 --> 01:12:48,854
I'm... I'm the one
who will say who looks, okay? I say it.

1008
01:12:49,186 --> 01:12:51,807
I'll say who goes. I'll say who looks.

1009
01:12:52,228 --> 01:12:53,620
I say who looks.

- I've never actually heard it before.
- Hmm.

1020
01:13:40,787 --> 01:13:43,121
♪ Together forever
That's how must be ♪

1021
01:13:43,186 --> 01:13:47,167
♪ To live without you
Would only be heartbreak for me... ♪

1022
01:13:54,353 --> 01:13:57,080
- It could be a false alarm, right?
- All right.

1023
01:13:57,145 --> 01:13:58,663
We're going upstairs to the bedroom.

1024
01:13:58,728 --> 01:14:02,996
We need towels, sponges,
um... scissors, and lots of water.

1025
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:06,871
Buckets of water. It's okay. It's okay.

1026
01:14:07,061 --> 01:14:08,770
It's okay.

1027
01:14:08,853 --> 01:14:10,436
It's okay.

1028
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,491
Take it easy. I've got you.

1029
01:14:12,556 --> 01:14:15,262
It's okay. It's okay.

1030
01:14:44,978 --> 01:14:50,902
Ah, the scissors are in the, um, drawer
by the side of your left hand. Yeah.

1031
01:15:01,728 --> 01:15:05,379
- Okay, so the baby's coming.
- No, not happening.

1032
01:15:05,444 --> 01:15:07,488
- Not happening.
- It's definitely coming.

1033
01:15:07,561 --> 01:15:10,457
- Come with me. Come with me.
- This is not happening.

1034
01:15:10,522 --> 01:15:12,879
It's happening. Let's go. Come on. Hey.

1035
01:15:12,944 --> 01:15:15,776
- I have to do the water.
- We'll do the water.

1036
01:15:21,845 --> 01:15:23,839
Okay, here we go.

1037
01:15:29,311 --> 01:15:31,761
- You two are doing great.
- Oh, shut up.

1038
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:03,200
One more time.

1039
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,474
Come on. Come on.

1040
01:16:43,316 --> 01:16:45,464
It's okay. It's okay.

1041
01:16:47,594 --> 01:16:49,134
It's a boy.

1042
01:16:50,219 --> 01:16:51,652
Oh.

1043
01:16:53,826 --> 01:16:55,296
No.

1044
01:16:56,353 --> 01:16:59,249
And your auntie thought you'd be a girl.

1045
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:27,351
Hey, new guy. New guy, let me in.

1046
01:17:27,441 --> 01:17:30,451
Just come and unlock the door. Come on.

1047
01:17:30,516 --> 01:17:32,616
Let me out. What are you doing?

1048
01:17:34,204 --> 01:17:35,577
What?

1049
01:17:41,685 --> 01:17:43,218
What are you doing?

1050
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:00,491
Gary?

1051
01:18:02,732 --> 01:18:03,929
Gary!

1052
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:05,555
Hey.

1053
01:18:06,103 --> 01:18:09,444
Tom! He put the birds in the freezer.

1054
01:18:09,509 --> 01:18:12,467
Tom, I told you he's fucking crazy.

1055
01:18:22,353 --> 01:18:23,665
Ga...

1056
01:18:26,936 --> 01:18:29,663
Tom. Get the shotgun.

1057
01:18:29,912 --> 01:18:31,347
He's crazy.

1058
01:18:37,895 --> 01:18:42,669
What the fuck are you doing?
We let you into this house. We let...

1059
01:18:48,728 --> 01:18:51,095
No! No! Fuck.

1060
01:18:51,603 --> 01:18:55,533
Fucking asshole.
I knew you were a fucking lunatic.

1061
01:18:55,598 --> 01:18:59,002
You fucking piece of shit. We saved you.

1062
01:18:59,603 --> 01:19:00,843
Fuck!

1063
01:19:06,853 --> 01:19:09,996
- Almost there.
- That's right. That's right.

1064
01:19:10,061 --> 01:19:12,264
Yes! Yes!

1065
01:19:12,826 --> 01:19:13,922
Yes.

1066
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,006
Oh.

1067
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:17,279
You did it, Mama. You did it.

1068
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:22,238
Oh.

1069
01:19:22,478 --> 01:19:23,706
Hello.

1070
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:26,246
You look so beautiful.

1071
01:19:26,348 --> 01:19:28,313
What's going on down there?

1072
01:19:30,895 --> 01:19:32,191
Can I see?

1073
01:19:41,936 --> 01:19:43,538
So beautiful.

1074
01:19:43,603 --> 01:19:45,019
Thank you.

1075
01:19:47,228 --> 01:19:49,040
Can I see yours?

1076
01:19:56,395 --> 01:19:57,871
Wow.

1077
01:19:59,891 --> 01:20:00,988
Hum.

1078
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:02,806
Thank you.

1079
01:20:05,045 --> 01:20:06,272
Look at this.

1080
01:20:07,076 --> 01:20:08,353
Look at this.

1081
01:20:10,395 --> 01:20:12,496
- Olympia, cover your eyes.
- Isn't it beautiful?

1082
01:20:12,561 --> 01:20:15,923
No. Why are you doing this?
Gary, please don't do this.

1083
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:18,621
- Look.
- Gary, please don't do this.

1084
01:20:18,686 --> 01:20:21,163
- Show the baby.
- No, no, no, Olympia.

1085
01:20:21,228 --> 01:20:22,913
Olympia, cover the baby's eyes.

1086
01:20:22,978 --> 01:20:24,472
Olympia.

1087
01:20:24,770 --> 01:20:26,213
See?

1088
01:20:27,103 --> 01:20:29,788
- Show your baby.
- Olympia, let me see your baby.

1089
01:20:30,478 --> 01:20:33,181
- You're not so bad.
- Olympia, let me see your baby.

1090
01:20:34,145 --> 01:20:37,455
Keep the baby's eyes covered.
Let me see your baby, just for one minute.

1091
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:41,038
Olympia, let me hold your baby
just for one minute!

1092
01:20:41,103 --> 01:20:42,415
Just one minute.

1093
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,371
Let me hold her for one minute, okay?

1094
01:20:44,436 --> 01:20:46,038
- One minute.
- See.

1095
01:20:46,103 --> 01:20:48,934
- Okay?
- See.

1096
01:20:50,607 --> 01:20:52,269
See!

1097
01:20:56,311 --> 01:21:00,663
No. Oh, no. Oh, please, no. Oh!

1098
01:21:00,728 --> 01:21:05,889
- See it. See it.
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

1099
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:39,004
Hey, Malorie.

1100
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:41,488
Give me the children.

1101
01:21:43,728 --> 01:21:45,361
Give me the kids.

1102
01:21:46,436 --> 01:21:48,455
Give me the children or I'll take them!

1103
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,556
Hey, asshole.

1104
01:21:50,832 --> 01:21:51,931
Hey.

1105
01:21:53,936 --> 01:21:55,603
What are you doing here?

1106
01:21:59,061 --> 01:22:00,971
Have you come to see?

1107
01:22:02,365 --> 01:22:04,072
Open your eyes.

1108
01:22:07,498 --> 01:22:09,225
Don't be frightened.

1109
01:22:10,686 --> 01:22:12,205
Look at me. Look at me.

1110
01:22:12,285 --> 01:22:15,213
Look at me. Look at me!

1111
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,197
Ow.

1112
01:22:48,311 --> 01:22:49,976
I'm sorry.

1113
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:56,418
I'm sorry that you didn't get to see.

1114
01:22:56,770 --> 01:22:58,621
It is beautiful.

1115
01:22:59,311 --> 01:23:01,152
So beautiful.

1116
01:23:03,853 --> 01:23:05,624
I'm sorry.

1117
01:23:09,686 --> 01:23:12,043
It shall cleanse the world.

1118
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:59,705
Please don't. Please don't hurt us.
Please stay away from us.

1119
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:02,246
Please. Please. Please. Please.

1120
01:24:02,311 --> 01:24:06,235
Please don't do this. Don't do this.
Please don't do this.

1121
01:24:09,061 --> 01:24:11,580
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1122
01:24:37,845 --> 01:24:39,488
Listen to the clicks.

1123
01:24:40,145 --> 01:24:43,721
Listen to the sounds,
if they're softer or louder.

1124
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,978
Listen to this.

1125
01:24:46,478 --> 01:24:47,971
Listen.

1126
01:24:48,853 --> 01:24:51,826
If they're louder,
you're in an open space. Do you hear that?

1127
01:24:51,899 --> 01:24:55,334
But if they're softer,
something is very close.

1128
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:57,709
Please. Anyone. Hello? Hello?

1129
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:59,647
Hello, hel...

1130
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:04,299
Hello?

1131
01:25:53,603 --> 01:25:55,344
Check it out. Yeah.

1132
01:25:57,103 --> 01:25:59,121
There is nothing here.

1133
01:25:59,645 --> 01:26:02,431
- Let's go to another spot.
- Fucking time.

1134
01:26:26,686 --> 01:26:28,547
- Hey.
- Hey.

1135
01:26:52,523 --> 01:26:53,901
What's wrong?

1136
01:26:55,353 --> 01:26:57,377
I heard some of them again.

1137
01:26:58,270 --> 01:26:59,486
What?

1138
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,103
A few of 'em...

1139
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:04,151
driving around.

1140
01:27:05,230 --> 01:27:07,792
Driving around like
they're not blindfolded.

1141
01:27:09,645 --> 01:27:10,888
Okay.

1142
01:27:12,353 --> 01:27:13,886
No more runs alone.

1143
01:27:15,353 --> 01:27:16,529
Okay.

1144
01:27:22,184 --> 01:27:23,503
What's this?

1145
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:26,496
I was thinking like
a warning system for the kids.

1146
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:28,605
You know, if they're in
trouble, ring the bell.

1147
01:27:29,367 --> 01:27:31,668
Right. That's nice.

1148
01:27:36,811 --> 01:27:38,222
How about this?

1149
01:27:38,895 --> 01:27:40,229
Oh, it's...

1150
01:27:40,592 --> 01:27:41,938
It's purely survival.

1151
01:27:42,003 --> 01:27:43,951
- Purely survival?
- Yeah.

1152
01:28:21,035 --> 01:28:22,972
Hello?

1153
01:28:23,728 --> 01:28:24,855
Hello?

1154
01:28:25,692 --> 01:28:27,907
Is anyone there? Hello?

1155
01:28:29,301 --> 01:28:30,663
Testing. Testing.

1156
01:28:30,728 --> 01:28:33,705
If there is anyone there, please respond.

1157
01:28:33,770 --> 01:28:35,413
- Hello?
- Hello.

1158
01:28:35,478 --> 01:28:36,853
Who is this?

1159
01:28:37,285 --> 01:28:39,178
My name is Rick.

1160
01:28:39,478 --> 01:28:40,775
Who is this?

1161
01:28:42,941 --> 01:28:44,163
Rick, this is Tom.

1162
01:28:44,228 --> 01:28:45,580
We have a place.

1163
01:28:45,645 --> 01:28:48,884
A compound with enough supplies...

1164
01:28:49,686 --> 01:28:51,345
We have a community.

1165
01:28:51,842 --> 01:28:53,628
It's safe here.

1166
01:28:54,186 --> 01:28:56,439
We're down by the river's end.

1167
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:58,871
- Where are you?
- Don't answer that.

1168
01:28:59,895 --> 01:29:01,712
Near Pike's Quarry.

1169
01:29:01,895 --> 01:29:05,917
Jesus. You're a ways away.
How many of you are there?

1170
01:29:06,353 --> 01:29:08,121
- Four of us.
- Hmm-mm.

1171
01:29:08,186 --> 01:29:10,251
Are any of them children?

1172
01:29:10,434 --> 01:29:12,806
- Don't, do not say anything.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1173
01:29:13,512 --> 01:29:16,253
No. Why?

1174
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:19,413
Because the fastest way
to get here is by the river,

1175
01:29:19,478 --> 01:29:22,574
and I don't think
you could make it with kids.

1176
01:29:22,895 --> 01:29:24,652
Wait, the river?

1177
01:29:25,061 --> 01:29:26,964
Float downstream as far as you can.

1178
01:29:27,128 --> 01:29:29,830
Stay on the water
until you hit the rapids.

1179
01:29:29,985 --> 01:29:32,420
The water is fast there. It's dangerous.

1180
01:29:32,895 --> 01:29:34,501
We've lost some people.

1181
01:29:35,061 --> 01:29:37,634
You need to see clearly.

1182
01:29:37,878 --> 01:29:40,134
- What does that mean?
- What do you mean, see clearly?

1183
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:43,330
You will have to look.

1184
01:29:44,353 --> 01:29:46,621
- I'm telling you.
- Rick, we'll have blindfolds on.

1185
01:29:46,686 --> 01:29:47,931
We can't look.

1186
01:29:47,996 --> 01:29:49,878
I'm glad you said that.

1187
01:29:49,973 --> 01:29:52,135
Someone will have to take a...

1188
01:29:53,186 --> 01:29:57,288
Prepare for two days' journey
at the pace of the river's current.

1189
01:29:57,353 --> 01:29:59,073
Bring supplies for longer.

1190
01:29:59,356 --> 01:30:01,541
How do I find you after the rapids, Rick?

1191
01:30:01,728 --> 01:30:03,237
You'll hear the birds.

1192
01:30:03,645 --> 01:30:06,830
We've got a lot of them.
Just follow the sound to us.

1193
01:30:06,895 --> 01:30:10,288
Down a small embankment,
you'll find a wall with a gate.

1194
01:30:10,353 --> 01:30:11,728
That's our...

1195
01:30:13,996 --> 01:30:15,721
- That's their what?
- That's our what?

1196
01:30:16,116 --> 01:30:17,598
Rick?

1197
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:19,410
Rick?

1198
01:30:30,443 --> 01:30:31,538
It could be real.

1199
01:30:31,603 --> 01:30:32,777
- No.
- Could be the truth.

1200
01:30:32,842 --> 01:30:34,913
- Could be is not good enough.
- What if Rick could help us?

1201
01:30:34,978 --> 01:30:36,663
And what if Rick is one of them?

1202
01:30:37,186 --> 01:30:38,338
Huh?

1203
01:30:38,782 --> 01:30:40,425
Wait, he knew about the birds.

1204
01:30:40,728 --> 01:30:43,675
Oh, my God. Gary knew about the birds
and he put them in the freezer.

1205
01:30:43,740 --> 01:30:46,144
I cannot believe
you're actually thinking about this.

1206
01:30:46,209 --> 01:30:47,746
Every house has run out of food.
We have to move.

1207
01:30:47,811 --> 01:30:51,424
You really don't think I know that?
You don't think I know that?

1208
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:59,066
When I was little,
we had a boat just like this.

1209
01:30:59,478 --> 01:31:01,746
And every single summer,
we would take it to the lake.

1210
01:31:01,811 --> 01:31:03,136
Every summer.

1211
01:31:03,353 --> 01:31:07,222
You guys would have loved it up there.
They had trees. They had flowers.

1212
01:31:07,353 --> 01:31:10,613
The water was warm,
the clouds were in the sky.

1213
01:31:11,061 --> 01:31:14,152
We'd all play in the water.
All the kids, all the children.

1214
01:31:14,217 --> 01:31:15,996
We would all just run
up and down the shore.

1215
01:31:16,061 --> 01:31:18,324
There were other children in the world?

1216
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:21,288
Yeah, just like you. Just like you.

1217
01:31:21,353 --> 01:31:23,389
Like you.

1218
01:31:23,587 --> 01:31:26,511
One day, we saw
this really, really big oak tree.

1219
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:28,181
It was bigger than this house.

1220
01:31:28,246 --> 01:31:30,761
It was so big and old,
I couldn't see the top of it.

1221
01:31:30,826 --> 01:31:32,605
- Guess what we did?
- Climbed it.

1222
01:31:32,693 --> 01:31:34,080
We climbed it.
Yes, we climbed it.

1223
01:31:34,145 --> 01:31:36,580
We climbed it and climbed it
until we got to the top.

1224
01:31:37,484 --> 01:31:39,080
Guess what we saw
when we got to the top?

1225
01:31:39,145 --> 01:31:40,663
Boy! Girl! Time for bed.

1226
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:42,288
But Tom's telling a story.

1227
01:31:42,353 --> 01:31:45,788
- Mal, let me just... We're almost done.
- I'm not gonna say it again. Come on.

1228
01:31:48,353 --> 01:31:49,660
Girl, come on.

1229
01:31:50,728 --> 01:31:52,076
Right now.

1230
01:31:52,162 --> 01:31:53,237
Come on.

1231
01:31:53,907 --> 01:31:55,732
Right now.

1232
01:31:56,145 --> 01:31:57,287
Bed!

1233
01:32:00,603 --> 01:32:02,667
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1234
01:32:02,732 --> 01:32:05,964
Now they think they're gonna go outside
and climb trees with all these new kids

1235
01:32:06,029 --> 01:32:07,830
- and see butterflies and flowers!
- It's a story.

1236
01:32:07,895 --> 01:32:09,792
It's not a story. It's a lie.

1237
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:12,941
Because they'll never climb trees,
they are never gonna make new friends.

1238
01:32:13,006 --> 01:32:15,831
- Why make them believe that?
- They have to believe in something.

1239
01:32:15,896 --> 01:32:17,824
What is this for if they don't have
anything to believe in, uh?

1240
01:32:17,889 --> 01:32:20,253
- So that they survive!
- Surviving is not living.

1241
01:32:20,318 --> 01:32:23,346
They're gonna die
if they listen to you!

1242
01:32:25,107 --> 01:32:28,205
Life is more than just what is. It's
what could be. What you could make it.

1243
01:32:28,270 --> 01:32:31,027
You need to promise them dreams
that may never come true.

1244
01:32:31,228 --> 01:32:34,269
You need to love them knowing
that you may lose them at any second.

1245
01:32:34,357 --> 01:32:36,510
Okay. They deserve dreams.
They deserve love.

1246
01:32:36,575 --> 01:32:38,777
They deserve hope.
They deserve a mother.

1247
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:41,402
They deserve a mother.

1248
01:32:41,645 --> 01:32:44,501
You haven't given them names, Mal.
Their names are Boy and Girl!

1249
01:32:44,566 --> 01:32:45,580
Think about that.

1250
01:32:45,645 --> 01:32:48,253
Every single decision I have made
has been for them.

1251
01:32:48,318 --> 01:32:50,729
Every single one.

1252
01:33:10,395 --> 01:33:12,104
You know what I saw?

1253
01:33:14,061 --> 01:33:15,861
At the top of the tree?

1254
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:18,871
I saw a nest.

1255
01:33:21,519 --> 01:33:22,912
With five birds.

1256
01:33:23,728 --> 01:33:25,931
Sitting on the top branch.

1257
01:33:30,603 --> 01:33:32,361
And then they just flew away.

1258
01:33:57,895 --> 01:34:00,845
Got it. Got it. Sit. Sit!

1259
01:34:29,561 --> 01:34:31,525
It's safe. Come in.

1260
01:35:04,811 --> 01:35:05,770
Wow.

1261
01:35:05,853 --> 01:35:07,720
No, you did not.

1262
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:11,525
- They're probably stale.
- Yeah.

1263
01:35:12,103 --> 01:35:13,361
Come here.

1264
01:35:14,436 --> 01:35:15,954
Just how I like 'em.

1265
01:35:16,904 --> 01:35:18,150
I'm sorry.

1266
01:35:20,186 --> 01:35:22,462
- Sorry.
- Me too.

1267
01:35:24,811 --> 01:35:26,345
Come here.

1268
01:35:42,145 --> 01:35:43,548
Kids.

1269
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,288
This is strawberry.

1270
01:35:49,353 --> 01:35:51,735
This is what strawberry tastes like.

1271
01:36:07,353 --> 01:36:09,634
- What's that?
- Quiet.

1272
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:15,626
Shh.

1273
01:36:17,545 --> 01:36:19,454
Anybody home?

1274
01:36:20,936 --> 01:36:23,158
Take the kids out the back.
I'll distract them.

1275
01:36:23,236 --> 01:36:26,408
If I'm not home in 15 minutes,
you take the kids to the boat and you go.

1276
01:36:26,552 --> 01:36:27,900
- I'm not leaving you!
- Mal.

1277
01:36:27,978 --> 01:36:30,500
- No, I'm not leaving you.
- Listen to me.  Listen to me.

1278
01:36:31,165 --> 01:36:32,846
I love you so much.

1279
01:36:34,395 --> 01:36:36,080
I love you. Go.

1280
01:36:36,145 --> 01:36:38,080
- No!
- Go. Please go.

1281
01:36:38,728 --> 01:36:40,117
Be good. Go.

1282
01:36:40,395 --> 01:36:41,479
Go!

1283
01:36:41,569 --> 01:36:42,917
I'm coming out!

1284
01:36:44,561 --> 01:36:47,354
- Hey there, friend.
- Can I help you?

1285
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:50,460
I don't think so, friend.

1286
01:36:50,561 --> 01:36:52,079
We can help you though.

1287
01:36:52,157 --> 01:36:53,615
No. Go!

1288
01:36:54,061 --> 01:36:56,322
- Take off your blindfold.
- Stand back.

1289
01:36:56,402 --> 01:36:58,501
- Stand back!
- She's not moving.

1290
01:37:03,478 --> 01:37:05,837
Hey. Got a woman and two kids 
over here.

1291
01:37:19,478 --> 01:37:20,751
They're coming.

1292
01:37:21,770 --> 01:37:23,038
They won't hurt you.

1293
01:37:23,103 --> 01:37:24,871
Fuck it. Fuck it.

1294
01:37:25,978 --> 01:37:27,501
On the contrary...

1295
01:37:28,818 --> 01:37:30,878
it's a beautiful thing, friend.

1296
01:39:53,186 --> 01:39:56,663
Listen to me.
I'm only gonna say this once.

1297
01:39:56,853 --> 01:39:59,683
We are going on the trip now.
It's going to be rough.

1298
01:39:59,798 --> 01:40:04,246
You have to do every single thing I say
or we will not make it.

1299
01:40:04,368 --> 01:40:05,753
Understand?

1300
01:40:06,818 --> 01:40:08,128
Where's Tom?

1301
01:40:09,038 --> 01:40:10,548
He's not coming.

1302
01:40:27,853 --> 01:40:31,157
It's time. It's time. It's time.

1303
01:40:44,282 --> 01:40:45,947
You remember the rapids?

1304
01:40:46,478 --> 01:40:48,712
Remember I told you about the rapids?

1305
01:40:50,043 --> 01:40:51,292
Well, they're close.

1306
01:40:51,357 --> 01:40:57,027
It is... <i>very</i> dangerous and there's only
one way for me to navigate through them.

1307
01:40:57,361 --> 01:40:58,871
Somebody has to look.

1308
01:40:58,978 --> 01:41:01,371
- I'll look.
- No. I will decide! Okay? I will decide.

1309
01:41:01,436 --> 01:41:03,759
Just give me... Just give me a second.

1310
01:41:11,207 --> 01:41:12,605
I'll do it.

1311
01:41:41,686 --> 01:41:43,652
I love you so much.

1312
01:41:53,270 --> 01:41:54,910
Nobody's looking.

1313
01:41:55,847 --> 01:41:57,557
Okay, nobody's looking.

1314
01:41:58,020 --> 01:41:59,342
Okay?

1315
01:42:09,561 --> 01:42:11,667
Do your eyes. Let's do eyes.

1316
01:42:17,561 --> 01:42:20,705
Come on. Get on your knees.
Stay down low. Hold on tight.

1317
01:42:20,811 --> 01:42:23,014
Don't move. Hold tight.

1318
01:42:38,178 --> 01:42:42,178
Hold tight. Don't let go.
We're gonna be okay.

1319
01:42:42,832 --> 01:42:44,165
Hold on!

1320
01:42:49,395 --> 01:42:51,459
Please hold on. Hold on!

1321
01:42:59,686 --> 01:43:00,919
Ah!

1322
01:43:05,887 --> 01:43:07,115
Ah!

1323
01:43:32,811 --> 01:43:34,420
Girl! Boy!

1324
01:43:44,311 --> 01:43:45,951
Girl! Boy!

1325
01:43:49,686 --> 01:43:51,660
Girl! Boy! Boy?

1326
01:43:52,634 --> 01:43:53,920
Girl!

1327
01:43:57,061 --> 01:43:58,420
Malorie.

1328
01:43:58,868 --> 01:44:00,006
Boy!

1329
01:44:00,197 --> 01:44:02,889
- Keep calling me! Keep calling me!
- Help!

1330
01:44:02,954 --> 01:44:05,609
- Malorie. Malorie!
- Keep calling me.

1331
01:44:05,686 --> 01:44:07,621
- I'm right here.
- Malorie!

1332
01:44:07,686 --> 01:44:09,580
- I'm coming. Where are you?
- Malorie.

1333
01:44:09,645 --> 01:44:12,423
Where's Girl? Girl? Girl?

1334
01:44:13,027 --> 01:44:15,920
Keep ringing. I hear you.
Keep ringing.

1335
01:44:30,185 --> 01:44:31,936
Keep ringing, Girl.

1336
01:44:32,452 --> 01:44:35,264
Keep ringing. Keep ringing.

1337
01:44:36,561 --> 01:44:38,022
Good girl.

1338
01:44:39,478 --> 01:44:42,983
Okay. Good job. Get up. Stand up.

1339
01:44:45,418 --> 01:44:48,371
Oh, good. Good, good, good.

1340
01:44:48,436 --> 01:44:51,337
Good girl. Okay.
Do you guys hear those birds?

1341
01:44:51,551 --> 01:44:54,189
That's where we're headed. Okay.
We just follow that sound.

1342
01:44:54,531 --> 01:44:56,369
Stay behind me.

1343
01:45:27,725 --> 01:45:28,807
Psst.

1344
01:45:28,903 --> 01:45:31,826
<i>Dumb-dumb.
Hey, dumb-dumb.</i>

1345
01:45:32,061 --> 01:45:35,830
<i>Open your eyes, Malorie.
Dummy. I'm right here.</i>

1346
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:37,876
No, no, no, no, no.

1347
01:45:37,941 --> 01:45:39,163
No, you're not.

1348
01:45:39,228 --> 01:45:41,163
No, no, no. No, no, no.

1349
01:45:41,228 --> 01:45:43,676
<i>Malorie, look at me.</i>

1350
01:45:46,786 --> 01:45:49,829
<i>Look at me.
Malorie, look at me.</i>

1351
01:45:49,936 --> 01:45:52,830
- <i>Malorie, look at me.</i>
- It's not real. It's not real.

1352
01:45:52,895 --> 01:45:55,999
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real. it's not real.

1353
01:46:02,770 --> 01:46:05,112
- Malorie?
- Malorie?

1354
01:46:09,162 --> 01:46:10,537
Malorie?

1355
01:46:17,707 --> 01:46:19,341
Malorie?

1356
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:33,808
<i>Malorie. Malorie.</i>

1357
01:46:34,145 --> 01:46:35,654
<i>Look at me, Malorie.</i>

1358
01:46:35,719 --> 01:46:37,837
- Boy. Girl.
- <i>Malorie.</i>

1359
01:46:37,902 --> 01:46:39,430
Don't move.
Stay right where you are!

1360
01:46:39,495 --> 01:46:40,618
Don't move.

1361
01:46:40,683 --> 01:46:41,900
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

1362
01:46:41,978 --> 01:46:44,371
<i>Open your eyes.
Open your eyes.</i>

1363
01:46:44,436 --> 01:46:46,874
<i>Malorie, open your eyes.</i>

1364
01:46:55,857 --> 01:46:58,942
Boy. Girl. Where are you?

1365
01:47:05,696 --> 01:47:07,851
<i>Come with me. Look at me.</i>

1366
01:47:08,401 --> 01:47:10,705
<i>I need you. Just look at me.</i>

1367
01:47:10,770 --> 01:47:13,020
Can I really take off
my blindfold?

1368
01:47:13,085 --> 01:47:14,883
- Boy!
- It's safe?

1369
01:47:14,948 --> 01:47:16,687
No, that's not me.

1370
01:47:17,683 --> 01:47:20,617
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Keep your blindfold on.

1371
01:47:20,682 --> 01:47:21,872
Boy, that's not real.

1372
01:47:21,937 --> 01:47:24,246
Keep your blindfold on. Listen to me.

1373
01:47:24,311 --> 01:47:26,921
Listen to my voice!
This is my voice!

1374
01:47:38,853 --> 01:47:40,819
<i>Girl, come with me. Look at me.</i>

1375
01:47:41,457 --> 01:47:43,663
<i>Take the blindfold off.
You can look at me.</i>

1376
01:47:43,728 --> 01:47:45,960
Isn't it dangerous if I look?

1377
01:47:46,214 --> 01:47:49,899
No. No, I'm right here. I'm right here!
Do not take off your blindfold!

1378
01:47:50,157 --> 01:47:51,952
Please listen to me!

1379
01:47:52,093 --> 01:47:53,397
- <i>Malorie.</i>
- What? No.

1380
01:47:53,462 --> 01:47:55,371
- Please open your eyes.
- No. Girl, call out to me.

1381
01:47:55,436 --> 01:47:57,417
- It's just beautiful.
- Call out to me, please.

1382
01:47:57,482 --> 01:47:59,472
Just call out to me,
where are you?

1383
01:47:59,561 --> 01:48:02,496
Boy. Girl. Where are you?
Don't take my children.

1384
01:48:02,561 --> 01:48:04,878
Do not take my children!

1385
01:48:07,446 --> 01:48:09,381
Oh, baby, keep ringing. Keep ringing.

1386
01:48:09,821 --> 01:48:11,978
Keep ringing, baby.
I'm coming. Keep ringing.

1387
01:48:12,043 --> 01:48:14,746
Keep ringing.
Come on, keep ringing. Keep ringing.

1388
01:48:14,811 --> 01:48:16,861
Oh, my God.
I've got you.

1389
01:48:17,079 --> 01:48:21,189
I've got you. We're good. Where's Girl?
Where's Girl? Where's Girl?

1390
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:23,765
Girl. Girl! Girl!

1391
01:48:23,972 --> 01:48:25,556
Where's Girl?

1392
01:48:25,621 --> 01:48:27,038
She's scared of you.

1393
01:48:27,103 --> 01:48:28,270
What?

1394
01:48:28,353 --> 01:48:30,064
She's scared of you.

1395
01:48:32,035 --> 01:48:33,192
It's okay.

1396
01:48:33,301 --> 01:48:34,301
Uh...

1397
01:48:35,301 --> 01:48:37,578
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1398
01:48:38,168 --> 01:48:40,796
I'm so sorry, sweet girl.
I'm so sorry.

1399
01:48:41,436 --> 01:48:44,187
I was wrong.
I shouldn't have been so harsh.

1400
01:48:44,936 --> 01:48:47,312
I shouldn't have stopped you from playing.

1401
01:48:47,603 --> 01:48:54,105
I shouldn't have ended Tom's story
because it wasn't finished.

1402
01:48:54,201 --> 01:48:58,323
When he climbed to the very top
of that giant oak tree,

1403
01:48:58,436 --> 01:49:01,066
he saw the most beautiful things.

1404
01:49:01,278 --> 01:49:04,909
He saw hundreds of children
playing games.

1405
01:49:05,072 --> 01:49:06,396
Hundreds.

1406
01:49:06,561 --> 01:49:08,753
And he saw birds...

1407
01:49:09,228 --> 01:49:10,830
all different colored birds,

1408
01:49:10,982 --> 01:49:14,120
and... and he saw us.

1409
01:49:14,395 --> 01:49:16,788
He saw us from the very top.

1410
01:49:16,935 --> 01:49:20,042
He saw us together,
and we have to be together.

1411
01:49:20,150 --> 01:49:22,210
And it's not just a story.

1412
01:49:22,381 --> 01:49:26,746
It's not, because I have
so much I want to show you.

1413
01:49:26,811 --> 01:49:30,496
I have so much
I want you to see. Okay?

1414
01:49:30,561 --> 01:49:32,746
But we have to do it together, okay?

1415
01:49:32,811 --> 01:49:36,831
So I just need you
to come to me right now, okay? Please?

1416
01:49:37,070 --> 01:49:38,511
Just come to me.

1417
01:49:38,576 --> 01:49:40,170
Baby, come to me, okay?

1418
01:49:40,235 --> 01:49:42,168
Oh! Ah.

1419
01:49:52,186 --> 01:49:55,160
I love you so much.
I love you so much. I love you so much.

1420
01:49:55,478 --> 01:49:57,205
I love you so much.

1421
01:49:57,270 --> 01:50:00,746
We need to find the birds, okay?
Find the birds.

1422
01:50:01,895 --> 01:50:04,402
I want you to listen
for the birds, okay?

1423
01:50:07,353 --> 01:50:09,003
Listen for the birds.

1424
01:50:09,395 --> 01:50:11,175
Okay, listen for the birds.

1425
01:50:20,061 --> 01:50:22,496
Listen for the birds.
Just listen for the birds.

1426
01:50:22,561 --> 01:50:24,085
<i>Malorie.</i>

1427
01:50:30,683 --> 01:50:32,351
<i>Malorie.</i>

1428
01:50:35,603 --> 01:50:38,292
Be quiet. Quiet.
Quiet. Quiet.

1429
01:50:38,357 --> 01:50:40,902
<i>Malorie,
I know you're scared, but it's me.</i>

1430
01:50:42,853 --> 01:50:45,238
<i>Please. Where are you, Mal?
I need help!</i>

1431
01:50:46,270 --> 01:50:48,425
<i>Just take a peek and find me.</i>

1432
01:50:50,186 --> 01:50:51,436
Come on.

1433
01:50:52,395 --> 01:50:53,562
Come on.

1434
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:58,413
Go to the birds.
Where are the birds?

1435
01:51:03,353 --> 01:51:06,220
Where are the birds?
The birds. Where are the birds?

1436
01:51:06,285 --> 01:51:07,855
That way.
That way.

1437
01:51:10,145 --> 01:51:12,413
I can't hear the birds!
I can't hear the birds!

1438
01:51:12,478 --> 01:51:14,330
It's too loud. It's too noisy!

1439
01:51:14,395 --> 01:51:17,462
Malorie! It's too loud!

1440
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:30,775
This way!

1441
01:52:06,673 --> 01:52:08,702
Step. Step.

1442
01:52:08,853 --> 01:52:11,538
Hello! Hello! Hello!

1443
01:52:11,603 --> 01:52:14,256
Open the door. Please open the door!

1444
01:52:14,431 --> 01:52:17,163
My name is Malorie.
I'm Malorie. I have children.

1445
01:52:17,228 --> 01:52:20,251
Please find Rick and tell Rick we followed
the river and we followed the birds.

1446
01:52:20,316 --> 01:52:21,513
<i>Malorie!</i>

1447
01:52:21,649 --> 01:52:22,933
- Help!
- <i>Look at me, Malorie!</i>

1448
01:52:22,998 --> 01:52:25,319
- Please!
- <i>Look at me, look at me, Malorie!</i>

1449
01:52:25,384 --> 01:52:26,717
Malorie.

1450
01:52:26,895 --> 01:52:30,345
Okay. Just take the children.
Just take the children.

1451
01:52:30,410 --> 01:52:33,384
Take the children. They're just children.
Please let my children in!

1452
01:52:33,449 --> 01:52:35,830
- Please! Open the door!
- <i>Look at me!</i>

1453
01:52:38,728 --> 01:52:41,288
Let me see your eyes!
Let me see your eyes!

1454
01:52:41,353 --> 01:52:42,465
Okay.

1455
01:52:48,645 --> 01:52:50,036
She's okay.

1456
01:52:51,186 --> 01:52:53,176
She's okay. They're all okay.

1457
01:52:53,395 --> 01:52:54,609
Get Rick.

1458
01:52:55,076 --> 01:52:56,609
It's okay.

1459
01:52:58,015 --> 01:52:59,330
<i>Malorie?</i>

1460
01:52:59,395 --> 01:53:00,577
Yes.

1461
01:53:01,228 --> 01:53:04,403
<i>I'm Rick. Come with me.</i>

1462
01:53:05,561 --> 01:53:06,834
Okay.

1463
01:53:06,912 --> 01:53:08,559
Right this way.

1464
01:53:12,311 --> 01:53:14,637
You're inside and you're safe.

1465
01:53:16,191 --> 01:53:18,403
You can take your blindfolds off.

1466
01:53:45,477 --> 01:53:46,827
Come with me.

1467
01:54:14,345 --> 01:54:15,431
The birds.

1468
01:54:15,561 --> 01:54:18,788
They warn the sighted people
whenever those things are around.

1469
01:54:18,910 --> 01:54:21,709
It's not much, but
it's something.

1470
01:54:33,561 --> 01:54:36,038
I'm going to get you
some dry clothes.

1471
01:54:45,770 --> 01:54:47,020
Hey.

1472
01:54:47,811 --> 01:54:53,027
What do you guys say we let the birds go
and be with their friends?

1473
01:54:53,477 --> 01:54:54,870
Shall we do that?

1474
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:58,045
Okay.

1475
01:55:11,824 --> 01:55:13,506
Malorie?

1476
01:55:15,078 --> 01:55:16,604
Malorie Hayes?

1477
01:55:16,978 --> 01:55:18,449
Dr. Lapham.

1478
01:55:23,395 --> 01:55:25,003
And what are your names?

1479
01:55:25,342 --> 01:55:26,600
Girl.

1480
01:55:28,176 --> 01:55:29,584
Boy.

1481
01:55:32,610 --> 01:55:34,113
Actually...

1482
01:55:35,566 --> 01:55:37,683
your name is Olympia.

1483
01:55:38,888 --> 01:55:40,286
Yeah.

1484
01:55:40,704 --> 01:55:43,722
Named after the sweetest girl I ever met.

1485
01:55:45,548 --> 01:55:47,114
And your name...

1486
01:55:49,228 --> 01:55:51,028
Your name is Tom.

1487
01:55:52,626 --> 01:55:53,968
Tom.

1488
01:55:59,740 --> 01:56:01,770
And I am their mother.

1489
01:56:07,592 --> 01:56:09,364
Would you like to
play with the other kids?

1490
01:56:09,429 --> 01:56:10,950
You want to go play?

1491
01:56:11,637 --> 01:56:13,052
You want to go play?

1492
01:56:28,087 --> 01:56:30,778
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
