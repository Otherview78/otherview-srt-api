1
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,720
Let's go eat.

2
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,230
Sorry, I gotta go.

3
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,340
Oh, okay. Never mind.

4
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,750
What?

5
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,400
I wanted to try that new ramen shop.

6
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,280
Oh, it wasn't so good.

7
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,430
I'll go home, then.

8
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,350
Seeing your big bro?

9
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,100
Yup.

10
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,540
Gotta borrow money.

11
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,390
So it's the end of the month already.

12
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,660
I felt as if summer would last forever.

13
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,560
The next season seemed like it'd never come even after September.

14
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,600
And your bird can sing

15
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,910
- I'm off. - See ya.

16
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,370
Drinks later?

17
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,060
I have other plans.

18
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,500
Next time, then.

19
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,450
Thanks for filling in.

20
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,290
Oh, no problem at all.

21
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,830
But it's about time he got fired.

22
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,750
He's irresponsible not showing up.

23
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,760
You may be right.

24
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,050
I saw your watch in a magazine.

25
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,150
It's cool.

26
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,620
See ya.

27
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,540
Mizuki, drinks tonight?

28
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,990
Sorry I have a date.

29
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,260
- Next time, then. - Sorry.

30
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,260
See you, Boss.

31
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,220
Thanks, guys.

32
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:57,850
Hey.

33
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,950
Good evening.

34
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,000
What are you doing?

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,560
Huh?

36
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,420
Why'd you skip work?

37
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,430
Well...

38
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,210
Early shift tomorrow?

39
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,250
Yes.

40
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,950
You better come.

41
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,510
Good night.

42
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:11,080
One, two, three, four, five...

43
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:18,080
11, 12, 13, 14, 15...

44
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,570
I'd never waited for a girl who I didn't know well.

45
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,390
21, 22,

46
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,580
I could've gotten the wrong idea,

47
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,570
so I decided to leave on the count of 120.

48
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,380
29, 30

49
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,450
I just had to take a chance.

50
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:40,860
33, 34, 3, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,

51
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:50,750
41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49,

52
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,840
113, 114, 115, 116, 117...

53
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,040
It worked.

54
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,140
You read my mind.

55
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,870
What were you doing?

56
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,400
I just got out of the movie theater.

57
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,890
Take me next time.

58
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,460
Sure.

59
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,510
Where's the boss?

60
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,320
Don't worry about him.

61
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,800
It doesn't matter.

62
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,100
Got a light?

63
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,300
You smoke, right?

64
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,170
Here.

65
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,650
Why don't we go for a drink?

66
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,230
Where's your spot?

67
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,030
Well, do you know Suginoko?

68
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,990
Kind of.

69
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,930
I gotta go home first, so meet me there.

70
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,170
- What time? - Let's see.

71
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:13,530
Maybe around 10. I'll text you.

72
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,670
- You have my number? - No.

73
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,510
Give it.

74
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,590
- What? - Nothing.

75
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,150
Here.

76
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,640
I'll text you.

77
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,480
- Promise? - Yup.

78
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,200
I'm home.

79
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,200
You got some?

80
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,740
- Money? - Yeah.

81
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,610
Don't you get that thing?

82
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,630
- What? - The thing! You know.

83
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,330
- Unemployment benefits? - That's it.

84
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,810
It got cut off.

85
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,780
Oh, that's terrible.

86
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,150
I wanted to borrow a little.

87
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,630
Ask your other son for money.

88
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,400
Anyway.

89
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,700
When I go senile,

90
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,250
I don't want you to get me treatment.

91
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,740
Want me to kill you?

92
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,010
Right. Kill me.

93
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,480
Gotcha.

94
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,830
Wow. Just like that, huh?

95
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,880
I don't think you can, though.

96
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,480
What do you mean?

97
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,960
Stop shaking your leg.

98
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,760
Stop nagging me.

99
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,460
What?

100
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,770
You drink too much.

101
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,960
You might really become senile.

102
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,360
Don't worry about me.

103
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,340
You're so sweet, Shizuo.

104
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,700
I love you.

105
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,150
Morning.

106
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,490
Oh, well.

107
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,550
I lied earlier.

108
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,290
I didn't see my brother,

109
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,010
I ran into my mom at a pub.

110
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,940
Oh. But wasn't she in the hospital?

111
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,760
She's out and staying at my brothers.

112
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,780
That's good.

113
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,790
I'm not sure..

114
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,940
It's not easy.

115
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,280
Give me that.

116
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,130
What?

117
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,340
Come closer.

118
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,420
Come here.

119
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,750
Stand there.

120
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,560
What are you doing?

121
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,300
Smell them.

122
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,400
They're real.

123
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,850
They do smell nice.

124
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,830
These don't.

125
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,690
What are they doing here?

126
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,490
You wanna carry that?

127
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,510
Let me help.

128
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,540
You dropped a leaf.

129
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,720
Hold on, wait.

130
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,590
You're gonna fall over.

131
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:21,040
Just lift this up straight...

132
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,570
See? I got this.

133
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:30,710
Hey, that's scary!

134
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,540
Looks like it's walking, huh?

135
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,230
It's getting heavy.

136
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,160
Good.

137
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,440
Here's your change and receipt.

138
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,100
Thank you.

139
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,630
Next, please.

140
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,950
Hey.

141
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,680
You smell like booze.

142
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,780
Is this the hipster style that's in fashion now?

143
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,760
No, not really.

144
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,330
At least get a pair of leather shoes.

145
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:38,920
Hey.

146
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,640
Don't you have something to say?

147
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,670
What?

148
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,270
Your ditching causes others trouble.

149
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,650
I didn't feel well, so I was sleeping all day.

150
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,930
You're such a liar.

151
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,030
Thanks for the lighter.

152
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:25,860
Oh, keep it.

153
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,250
Did you go to the pub yesterday?

154
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,190
Yeah, of course.

155
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,030
Did you talk to Motoko?

156
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,500
It's a good pub.

157
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,730
I like her, the owner.

158
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,430
We were talking trash about you.

159
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,700
What's wrong with me?

160
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,590
You broke your promise.

161
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,010
I fell asleep.

162
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,010
And?

163
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,950
I got up and drank till dawn.

164
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,180
Are you upset?

165
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:25,940
No.

166
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,610
Just surprised.

167
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,720
Sorry.

168
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,950
You really are insincere.

169
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,110
Insincere?

170
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,690
Insincere huh...

171
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,490
Did you drink alone?

172
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,960
No, with someone I live with.

173
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,140
So you got a girlfriend?

174
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,060
Guy friend.

175
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,310
It's cheaper to split the rent.

176
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,530
What's your life like?

177
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,360
You know.

178
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,180
I'm just a part-timer at a bookstore.

179
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,100
Hey.

180
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,880
On your face.

181
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,040
Gross.

182
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,070
Here, use this.

183
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,210
Thank you.

184
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,740
Do you want this?

185
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,140
Can I?

186
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,080
Thanks.

187
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,290
Okay, thank you.

188
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,190
I can't keep this.

189
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,510
It's okay.

190
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,210
You don't need it?

191
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:49,890
No.

192
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:50,500
Really?

193
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,730
I'll keep it then.

194
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,690
Thanks for this.

195
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,120
It's good.

196
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,990
"Thanks for the sandwich"

197
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,380
Welcome.

198
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,480
Over there.

199
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,630
I don't want any drama.

200
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,280
Don't worry.

201
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,650
No drama.

202
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,270
Just a second, it's hot.

203
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,080
It's cramped here.

204
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,470
Floor?

205
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:25,690
It's okay.

206
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,580
You sure?

207
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,100
Oh wait, there's a bug.

208
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,400
Don't move.

209
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,810
You're not gonna kill it?

210
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,760
My friend hates it when I do.

211
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:58,900
Keep it open.

212
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,480
- Oh, hey. - Huh?

213
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,290
You got a rubber?

214
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,980
What are you doing?

215
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,500
Get down first.

216
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,170
It hurts.

217
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,790
Here.

218
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,620
Thanks.

219
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,150
Hurry.

220
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,820
What?

221
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,220
Got it.

222
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,000
Was that your friend just now?

223
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,150
Yeah, probably.

224
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,280
You heard?

225
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,010
Yeah. I feel bad.

226
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,240
He's fine.

227
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
I hope so.

228
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,200
Oh hey, you're back.

229
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,210
He's the one I told you about.

230
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,120
I'm Shizuo.

231
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,120
I'm Sachiko. Nice to meet you.

232
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,460
Nice to meet you.

233
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,400
Want a tomato?

234
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,200
No, I'm fine. I'll just have a drink.

235
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,100
It's quiet next door.

236
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,680
Yeah, haven't heard any noise today.

237
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,400
That's good.

238
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,500
What's that about?

239
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,300
It's not that interesting.

240
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:18,000
- Oh, shall we? - Oh, yeah.

241
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,600
Cheers.

242
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,400
How did you guys meet?

243
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,120
We work at the same bookstore.

244
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,780
And you guys?

245
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:49,130
We worked in the same factory.

246
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,050
Oh, what kind?

247
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,120
Ice cream.

248
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,400
Sounds like fun.

249
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,100
It was pretty rough.

250
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,900
We were working in a giant freezer,

251
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,540
so we had to be dressed like Eskimos.

252
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,580
Good evening.

253
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,880
- I'll take that. - Thank you.

254
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,600
Oh, we're out of soda.

255
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,700
Okay.

256
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,540
- How much? - It's already 1,500 yen.

257
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,750
Now it's 2,000 yen,

258
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,820
Damn it.

259
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,800
I put toilet paper in.

260
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,400
It's for our place.

261
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,390
I don't have enough.

262
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,400
What?

263
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,090
Just kidding.

264
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,300
She'll regret offering to pay.

265
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,090
The total is 3,219 yen.

266
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,150
We bought a lot.

267
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,480
I only have a big bill.

268
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,880
Thank you.

269
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,810
Oh, you're getting there.

270
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,280
Watch out for your tongue.

271
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,700
Mouth harps?

272
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,320
Look.

273
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,510
Did you really need to stop him for that?

274
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,400
Does that really count?

275
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:40,890
She does it better than I do.

276
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,480
I'm not so sure about that.

277
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,150
- Here. - Thanks.

278
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:45,840
Have some ice.

279
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,920
It's cold.

280
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,700
Doesn't it feel nice?

281
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,480
Let me try.

282
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,600
Can you do it?

283
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,200
I can do it.

284
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,010
Not.

285
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,300
Give me a second.

286
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,980
You suck.

287
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,710
Are the trains still running?

288
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:28,180
Yeah.

289
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,600
It's okay, I'll clean up later.

290
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,460
Stay over tonight.

291
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,490
I'm going home.

292
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,810
Leaving already?

293
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:05,810
Yeah, I'm leaving.

294
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:07,970
Hey, Sachiko.

295
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,750
What?

296
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,900
Let's go see a movie together, soon.

297
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,650
Okay.

298
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,460
Now go back to sleep.

299
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:27,300
Please say good night, then.

300
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,490
Sure. Good night.

301
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,190
Night.

302
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,300
I'll return your shirt later.

303
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:11,750
It's Shizuo's shirt.

304
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,560
You'll catch a cold.

305
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,130
What?

306
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:16,860
You'll catch a cold.

307
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,000
It feels nice.

308
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,150
Is it really okay?

309
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,490
Yup, it's fine.

310
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,990
Does Shizuo always get this wasted?

311
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,270
Oh, wait.

312
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,650
One, two, three...

313
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,500
- Here. - What?

314
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,300
Didn't you need it?

315
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,180
You just paid for us.

316
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,300
Forget that. Take it.

317
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,240
Thanks. I'll pay it back.

318
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,380
Shizuo asked me out.

319
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,180
Go for it.

320
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,520
Are you sure?

321
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,830
I'll miss the train.

322
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:41,780
Okay.

323
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,100
Good night.

324
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:49,890
Bye.

325
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:50,650
Good night.

326
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,660
Here, take this.

327
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,800
You got paid?

328
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,330
I'll sell my books to pay you back.

329
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,620
Don't worry about it.

330
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:17,300
I drank too much.

331
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,400
Was Sachiko disgusted?

332
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,000
She wants to see a movie with you.

333
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,250
A movie?

334
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,080
You asked her.

335
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,300
You should go.

336
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,540
Why?

337
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,210
What why?

338
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:39,130
Why'd you say that?

339
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,280
She's free to do what she wants.

340
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,490
That's not what I asked.

341
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,780
I mean...

342
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,600
What?

343
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,100
I don't know.

344
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,000
My head hurts.

345
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,930
Good night.

346
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,130
Turn off the lights.

347
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,110
My bad.

348
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,400
It's okay.

349
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,000
He's aiming here.

350
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,230
That's his strategy.

351
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,940
Get out of the way, you two.

352
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,800
So, for this...

353
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,540
Do I hit the side?

354
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,070
Right, either hit the side,

355
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:28,600
or make this ball come back to hit it.

356
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,440
Lean your body a little this way.

357
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,170
Hold it up a little.

358
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,500
And move over a little.

359
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,190
Then, do you see the line?

360
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,650
Hold it straight.

361
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,350
Like this?

362
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,690
Right in the center.

363
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:58,600
Hit it.

364
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,940
Here's your drink.

365
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,120
- Getting hot? - Yeah.

366
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,000
My bad!

367
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,500
Damn.

368
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,190
Here is your change.

369
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,280
Please wait.

370
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,720
So, how was the bunk bed?

371
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,200
It felt cramped.

372
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,010
The ceiling was this high.

373
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,300
I mean the sex, not the bed.

374
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,910
- Oh, that? - Yes.

375
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,070
How was it like...?

376
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,900
It was just right.

377
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,080
Just right?

378
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,810
Wow, that sounds so mature.

379
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,040
What's "just right"?

380
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,230
Let's drop it.

381
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:41,560
The tonkatsu and prawn lunch box is ready.

382
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:47,140
If you don't mind me asking... Was it our boss?

383
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,420
The manager is married.

384
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,910
But that doesn't really matter.

385
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,100
He wouldn't have a bunk bed...

386
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,470
Fried chicken noodles are ready.

387
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,900
Why did you think so?

388
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:06,100
No particular reason. Just a hunch.

389
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,450
What is love anyway?

390
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,430
Why is everyone a liar?

391
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,290
You shouldn't dwell on it.

392
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,810
But when I look at the freshmen at school,

393
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:26,190
I feel super old.

394
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,980
It kind of freaks me out.

395
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:37,410
Will youth really fade away as we grow older?

396
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:39,960
We'll have to see about that.

397
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,600
But sometimes there are cute old ladies.

398
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,250
Your order is here.

399
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:46,490
Coming.

400
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,100
Two special lunch boxes for you.

401
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:49,850
Ok.

402
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,010
Cheers.

403
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:19,410
It might be hard to make out what I'm saying when I rap,

404
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,940
but get into the rhythm and move if you feel me.

405
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,940
That would be dope if ya'll do.

406
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,140
So let's have fun.

407
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,400
You ready?

408
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,100
Yeah, I like that.

409
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:44,070
It all depends on how you look at things.

410
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,010
Let's get it!

411
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,130
Think good.

412
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,370
I must be a wimp,

413
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:03,020
just trippin' over nothin'

414
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,580
Insidious beef out of diffidence,

415
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,230
time to confess, get serious

416
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:10,860
Feelin' like runnin' away,

417
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,700
bein' paranoid of virtual shamin'

418
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:16,330
Annoyed, reality is far from ideal,

419
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:19,260
all results of gutless stunts

420
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,390
Engage honestly with others,

421
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,030
don't behave or talk like suckers

422
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,940
Recognize true kindness,

423
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,840
believe in yourself till the limits

424
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,580
Left my mark on the top, bet I won't ever stop

425
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:36,760
Till everybody thinks I'm nuts I'm gonna keep hustlin'

426
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,830
Look forward.

427
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:42,330
Do it, do it, do it.

428
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:45,630
I'm OMSB and I'm having a blast.

429
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:47,140
Think good.

430
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,900
Let's drink another one.

431
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:17,880
Oh.

432
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,550
Hey, you!

433
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:19,920
That was amazing.

434
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,170
Have a drink.

435
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,040
It's on us.

436
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:30,400
Cheers.

437
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,000
Delicious.

438
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,710
Another glass.

439
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,330
Watch your feet.

440
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:42,040
You're so sweaty.

441
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,020
Look at you.

442
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,010
I'm soaked.

443
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,300
You are.

444
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:25,260
Watch out for cars.

445
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:24,900
Oops, my bra.

446
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:50,680
Here.

447
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,090
You're heavy.

448
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:29,840
He's been out a while.

449
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,800
He doesn't wanna bother us.

450
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:36,670
Isn't he being too nice?

451
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,310
We just mind our own business.

452
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,640
We live and let live.

453
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:47,500
Why?

454
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:50,170
Because we're friends.

455
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,330
You're lucky to have Shizuo in your life.

456
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:00,680
Yeah, I agree.

457
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,730
Are we friends?

458
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:41,100
I'm out. Call me if anything comes up.

459
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,510
Will do.

460
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:45,940
See you guys.

461
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:46,250
Okay.

462
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,760
I guess we don't carry that book...

463
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,680
In that category, this one has been popular.

464
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:00,040
All right. Then I'll buy this, thanks.

465
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,280
Thank you.

466
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:20,310
Hey, we've got a shoplifter.

467
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:21,800
Come.

468
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,490
Why'd you ignore me?

469
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:49,360
Did you catch him?

470
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,540
No, he escaped.

471
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,560
Why did you let him go?

472
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,510
You need to relax.

473
00:53:56,510 --> 00:53:57,760
I'm relaxed.

474
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,790
Your lips are twitching.

475
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:03,450
Don't mess with me.

476
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,060
You're so useless.

477
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,660
Mr. Moriguchi, you have a funny face.

478
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,470
Are you okay?

479
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:24,270
I'm fine.

480
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,790
Excuse us. Our apologies.

481
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:28,640
Sorry for the disturbance.

482
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,070
He was bleeding.

483
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:39,250
He did it himself.

484
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:41,850
I was ready to beat him up.

485
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,560
- Were you really? - Yup.

486
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,050
Stop picking fights.

487
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:53,130
He's not answering.

488
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:06,450
Did you tell Shizuo about me and our boss?

489
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:09,870
Hell no. It doesn't matter.

490
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:11,780
Right.

491
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:14,340
Why?

492
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:18,420
I was just... curious.

493
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,990
I'm gonna talk to him tonight.

494
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,290
Oh, you're still seeing him.

495
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,980
It's a pain,

496
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:45,340
but I need to do the right thing.

497
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:47,800
Call me when you finish.

498
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:53,050
It's not that easy to break up with someone.

499
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,570
Is it such a big deal?

500
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:57,800
Wasn't it like a fling?

501
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,520
Don't say it like that.

502
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,490
How dare you.

503
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:10,580
You're judging me for dating the boss.

504
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,570
I'm not judging.

505
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,830
Say something better, then.

506
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,840
What will be, will be.

507
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,360
It'll fade if you stay away from him.

508
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,520
You don't get it.

509
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,730
Whatever.

510
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,620
Don't worry about it.

511
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,610
When is your friend coming?

512
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:54,940
Soon, I think.

513
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,770
Where to after?

514
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:58,770
We haven't decided.

515
00:56:58,770 --> 00:56:59,500
I see.

516
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:02,860
Stay out of trouble.

517
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,400
Sure. Thank you.

518
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,230
You can go.

519
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:05,860
Okay.

520
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,160
What happened?

521
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:11,240
Are you his friend?

522
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:11,750
Yes.

523
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,650
What did they want?

524
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,810
Good night.

525
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:42,470
Bye.

526
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:43,370
Leaving already?

527
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,700
Just one more drink.

528
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,460
No more. Let's go home.

529
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:48,830
- Bye - See ya.

530
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:41,800
You won't go camping?

531
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,710
It's not for me.

532
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:48,650
We can just relax for days,

533
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:50,710
and do nothing.

534
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:52,020
I know.

535
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,390
We'll build a fire after dark...

536
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,580
and look at the stars.

537
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,640
Wake up, make some coffee...

538
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:05,970
stare at the lake,

539
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,390
take a nap...

540
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,440
Can't you imagine that?

541
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:19,270
I'm just not interested.

542
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:19,780
Here.

543
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:27,010
Just me and Sachiko, then.

544
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:04,520
It's held until November 30th.

545
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:10,570
It takes place at the vocational school on this map.

546
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,110
That's it for now. Any questions?

547
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,120
No, I'm fine.

548
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:16,990
Good luck.

549
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,410
"Off today? Ditching?" "Not coming anymore"

550
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:13,330
"I'll tell you next time" "You okay?"

551
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,050
"Want me to talk with the boss?"

552
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,830
May we have a word?

553
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,140
Sure.

554
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:53,800
Do you know the profits a book makes?

555
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:58,680
I have no idea.

556
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,900
If one book is stolen,

557
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:06,220
we have to sell ten books to break even.

558
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:08,780
It affects the business.

559
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,800
You can fire me.

560
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:14,010
Don't be like that.

561
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:18,360
You gotta be more responsible.

562
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,220
I'll catch the next thief for sure.

563
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,520
Fine. Do that.

564
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:55,760
Going home, sir?

565
01:02:56,590 --> 01:02:57,220
Yeah.

566
01:02:58,450 --> 01:02:59,660
I didn't get enough sleep.

567
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,590
I don't feel well.

568
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,540
Your wife will be shocked to see you home early.

569
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:10,520
Didn't I tell you?

570
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:12,340
I...

571
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:14,940
got divorced the year before last.

572
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,050
Being single is much easier.

573
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:49,850
Just come to work on time. That's all I ask.

574
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,110
In regard to Sachiko,

575
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:54,810
take care of her.

576
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:03,370
Did you wait long?

577
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:05,450
Not at all. Thanks for coming.

578
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:08,470
What do we do?

579
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:23,530
Hey.

580
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:26,580
Why'd you decide to live together?

581
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,100
Besides saving money.

582
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:34,090
Well...

583
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:36,550
Because it's fun.

584
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:40,180
That's it?

585
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:42,270
You know,

586
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:44,230
he's oddly cheerful.

587
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:47,200
And he's candid.

588
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,730
Sometimes I don't know what he's thinking.

589
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:56,710
That's probably because

590
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,020
he's really not thinking anything.

591
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,140
Is everything okay?

592
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:16,640
Things led to things.

593
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:20,520
How can I explain this?

594
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:27,190
Just a bunch of stuff

595
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,690
I can't figure out.

596
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:32,490
Look.

597
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:35,540
I burned a hole with a cigarette by accident.

598
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:37,840
Nice shirt.

599
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:39,250
Really?

600
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:40,090
I like it a lot.

601
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:41,610
Thank you.

602
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,840
It was all my fault. I apologize.

603
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:55,880
What are you talking about?

604
01:07:57,110 --> 01:08:00,880
I told him about the th... th... thief.

605
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:04,000
That you let him run away.

606
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:09,240
I know you just got chewed out.

607
01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:13,400
I want us to be cool.

608
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:19,380
Let's make peace.

609
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,280
I don't care.

610
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,670
Okay. We're good, then.

611
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,230
We gotta fill in Sachiko's spot.

612
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:59,770
I saw Sachiko and the boss together last night.

613
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:02,280
They must be dating.

614
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,810
Those scums are having fun

615
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:07,580
while we're working hard.

616
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:08,050
What?

617
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:09,730
I said,

618
01:09:10,050 --> 01:09:12,300
we're the only ones working hard.

619
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:14,390
People like them are scum.

620
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:19,710
Am I right?

621
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:31,480
Don't tell me you liked Sachiko, too?

622
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:40,000
You just don't get it.

623
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,060
It hurts.

624
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:55,920
I'm sorry. Sorry.

625
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:12,460
Your mom is calling.

626
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:12,990
Oh.

627
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,240
Why don't you ever pick up?

628
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:38,600
Hey, Sachiko.

629
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:42,270
Am I getting in between you two?

630
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,230
Stop talking nonsense.

631
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:58,410
I listen to my favorite song Alone, just like I used to

632
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:12,680
Olivia has always given my lonely heart Comfort and consolation

633
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:24,050
With a cup of jasmine tea I think I can sleep well tonight.

634
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:38,850
All I want is to end the night The way I want it to

635
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:50,160
I'd never expected a day like this Would ever come when we first met.

636
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:54,830
Making good things better

637
01:11:54,830 --> 01:12:04,150
No, those days are gone Time has passed, we have changed.

638
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:18,350
The love we had wore us down Because you only loved my illusion

639
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,030
We're back.

640
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:34,920
So stuffy.

641
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:49,700
Be quiet.

642
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:54,220
When did you get back?

643
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:56,680
I don't remember.

644
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,400
What time was it?

645
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:03,690
Did we wake you up?

646
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:04,900
No.

647
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:09,250
Shizuo was pretty loud.

648
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:12,390
I was dead asleep.

649
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:16,460
That's good.

650
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:20,320
You should've come.

651
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:26,320
I just can't get into karaoke.

652
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:45,330
You just lied.

653
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:46,830
What?

654
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:51,130
When we came back last night,

655
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:52,250
were you actually awake?

656
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:57,220
As if I was jealous?

657
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:58,510
What?

658
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:00,180
You got it. I was.

659
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,600
Stop it.

660
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,740
You're the one who asked.

661
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:06,940
Excuse me.

662
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,580
I'm going to work.

663
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:20,640
Hey.

664
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,540
Did the boss say anything about me?

665
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:26,330
Yeah.

666
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:28,770
What?

667
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:34,800
He told me to take care of you.

668
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:37,430
What did you say?

669
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:40,440
Oh, nothing.

670
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:46,260
Why is that?

671
01:14:49,870 --> 01:14:50,610
What?

672
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:53,310
What's that look for?

673
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:01,670
Then I'm going out.

674
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:03,440
Have fun camping.

675
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:19,820
He left already?

676
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:20,940
Yeah.

677
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:22,330
Okay.

678
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,550
Did he take his umbrella?

679
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:26,620
No.

680
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,410
I don't think it'll rain today.

681
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:30,990
The weather's unpredictable around this time.

682
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:32,670
True.

683
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:43,640
Want some coffee?

684
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,120
Yeah, I'll have some.

685
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:29,610
Hey.

686
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:37,140
Not budging.

687
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:56,480
Let me do it.

688
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:02,260
You tie this one like this...

689
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,100
Done.

690
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:14,480
I'm Hasegawa. Nice to meet you.

691
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,540
Likewise

692
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:17,430
I forgot to wear pants.

693
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,950
Oh, it's fine.

694
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:23,030
Come with me.

695
01:17:26,910 --> 01:17:27,590
This way.

696
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:41,230
I couldn't reach Moriguchi all day.

697
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:42,470
Maybe he quit.

698
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,480
I don't think so.

699
01:17:45,610 --> 01:17:48,170
It's unlikely for someone his age.

700
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:50,090
I couldn't care less.

701
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:58,270
You didn't do anything to him, did you?

702
01:17:59,110 --> 01:17:59,940
No way.

703
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:07,130
Remember to lock the door.

704
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:08,610
Okay. See you.

705
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:13,650
I'm home.

706
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:24,220
"Sorry, we're closed today. Suginoko"

707
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,040
Sit down!

708
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:05,640
Sit down!

709
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,890
What?

710
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:12,500
What do you want?

711
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:13,700
I hate you!

712
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:18,970
Ow!

713
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:23,470
It hurts.

714
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:27,420
Ow.

715
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:41,290
No way.

716
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:45,620
Wake up.

717
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:52,890
Ouch.

718
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:02,560
What's the hell?

719
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:03,710
Ouch.

720
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:09,970
It hurts.

721
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,100
What the hell was that?

722
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:46,470
It's cold.

723
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:48,780
Damn it.

724
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:20,900
Shizuo?

725
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:29,990
Are you Shizuo's mother?

726
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:32,480
Yes.

727
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:35,210
Is there a problem?

728
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:41,420
He never picks up his phone

729
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:44,190
and doesn't return my texts.

730
01:22:44,670 --> 01:22:46,200
I'll let him call when he's back.

731
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:48,380
He's been away?

732
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,580
He went camping.

733
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:57,530
Without working. What in the world is he doing?

734
01:23:02,430 --> 01:23:03,700
Those cuts...

735
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:05,680
Did my son do that?

736
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:06,640
Oh, no.

737
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:09,740
Did you clean them?

738
01:23:10,530 --> 01:23:12,560
- Let me help. - No, I'm fine.

739
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:13,630
It'll heal soon.

740
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:15,550
You're right.

741
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:16,280
Ok.

742
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,000
Bye.

743
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:26,170
Can you not tell Shizuo

744
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:29,300
that I came here?

745
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,240
Of course.

746
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:32,810
Bye.

747
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:36,760
Wait a second!

748
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:57,800
Please accept this.

749
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:11,590
You're a good kid.

750
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:16,310
Don't worry about him too much.

751
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:19,500
He knows what he's doing.

752
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:23,710
You think so?

753
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:29,400
Goodbye.

754
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:01,750
You have work hard.

755
01:25:03,770 --> 01:25:05,110
We're leaving.

756
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:06,390
See you.

757
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:08,440
Would you like to have a drink with us?

758
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:12,780
I'll come if I can.

759
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:14,880
See you later.

760
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,110
See you.

761
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:23,580
Oh really?

762
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:36,670
Okay.

763
01:25:49,290 --> 01:25:51,440
No, I won't.

764
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:55,840
I'm home.

765
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:57,100
Welcome home.

766
01:25:58,580 --> 01:25:59,420
Welcome home.

767
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:01,740
How was camping?

768
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:04,700
Exhausting.

769
01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:08,730
Was Shizuo there?

770
01:26:09,010 --> 01:26:10,190
Yeah, on the phone.

771
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:12,970
Looks like his brother is calling.

772
01:26:12,970 --> 01:26:14,020
Really?

773
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:26,040
What was it about?

774
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:28,060
My mom collapsed.

775
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:33,160
Really?

776
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:35,360
Yeah. She had a seizure.

777
01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:44,620
Is she okay?

778
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,250
I don't know.

779
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:48,450
But she won't die.

780
01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:53,000
You're lying.

781
01:26:54,050 --> 01:26:55,610
Why would I lie?

782
01:26:55,610 --> 01:27:00,250
Because I saw her. Two days ago.

783
01:27:00,910 --> 01:27:01,720
My mother?

784
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:03,930
She came to see you.

785
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:08,340
Was she fine then?

786
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:13,120
Well, she didn't look sick.

787
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:18,200
But she was real worried about you, Shizuo.

788
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:24,390
You going there?

789
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:26,430
There are no trains now.

790
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:27,750
I'll see her tomorrow morning.

791
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:37,500
Good idea.

792
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,810
It'd be best for her to die instantly.

793
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:53,440
What?

794
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:56,730
It's too much hassle.

795
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,320
I guess karma got me.

796
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:03,350
What karma?

797
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:08,000
For hanging out and drinking every day like this.

798
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:12,830
Don't think about it.

799
01:28:16,850 --> 01:28:19,040
What's wrong with hanging out?

800
01:28:19,810 --> 01:28:21,610
Don't be so childish.

801
01:28:23,010 --> 01:28:24,080
Am I wrong?

802
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:27,660
You just don't get it.

803
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:29,490
Sachiko's next.

804
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:42,070
Wanna leave?

805
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:43,980
Who wanted to drink?

806
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:44,860
You did.

807
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:45,830
No, you.

808
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,070
Go ahead, Sachiko.

809
01:28:53,110 --> 01:28:54,090
Let's go home.

810
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:58,320
Let's get some rest

811
01:28:59,050 --> 01:29:01,540
and go see his mom together.

812
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:02,390
You're coming?

813
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:03,720
I can't?

814
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:04,720
I don't mind.

815
01:29:06,790 --> 01:29:09,550
But she probably won't be able to recognize anybody.

816
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:13,140
I'll just go alone.

817
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:20,430
When you come back, let's all drink together again.

818
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,110
Get some sleep.

819
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,230
Can't we drink now?

820
01:29:27,230 --> 01:29:29,600
You just said it's not a problem.

821
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:45,410
That was close.

822
01:29:45,410 --> 01:29:48,240
It almost hit the center.

823
01:29:48,610 --> 01:29:50,830
I almost got the center.

824
01:29:50,830 --> 01:29:52,160
One eye closed works really well.

825
01:29:59,780 --> 01:30:00,930
I'll just keep going.

826
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:06,640
You crack me up.

827
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:08,730
Sorry.

828
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:13,760
What are you doing?

829
01:31:23,670 --> 01:31:24,470
Let's go home.

830
01:31:25,850 --> 01:31:26,580
Let's go

831
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:29,460
This way.

832
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:31,660
Why?

833
01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:33,680
I'm not going home.

834
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:35,870
Just a little more.

835
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,260
Are you okay?

836
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:58,390
Hey, get up. Let's go home.

837
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:09,120
Hey, boss.

838
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:09,710
Yes?

839
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:10,970
You're the best.

840
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:14,110
I love you.

841
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:21,680
It's time.

842
01:34:37,070 --> 01:34:37,620
Bye.

843
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:39,780
The doctor says Mom is in critical condition.

844
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:43,410
and most likely permanently disabled.

845
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:47,390
I don't know yet how long

846
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:49,450
I have to stay here.

847
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:53,750
The hospital smell is unbearable.

848
01:35:55,060 --> 01:35:57,180
I tried to remember the smells of

849
01:35:57,700 --> 01:35:59,680
places where us three would hang out.

850
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:01,470
But

851
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:05,400
I can't remember any of it at all.

852
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:33,000
Let's get going.

853
01:36:39,790 --> 01:36:41,410
I got something to tell you.

854
01:36:50,950 --> 01:36:51,710
Okay.

855
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:03,990
The thing is...

856
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:08,080
I've decided to date Shizuo.

857
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:27,240
I wanted to tell you properly.

858
01:37:30,490 --> 01:37:32,530
I could tell just by looking at you two.

859
01:37:43,450 --> 01:37:44,460
What's wrong?

860
01:37:46,210 --> 01:37:46,850
Nothing.

861
01:37:49,770 --> 01:37:51,260
I was just nervous.

862
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:56,400
I see.

863
01:37:59,110 --> 01:38:00,010
You know.

864
01:38:06,370 --> 01:38:08,710
I was hoping you'd become a couple.

865
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:14,700
Once Shizuo comes back from the hospital,

866
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:17,760
perhaps I can feel a different side

867
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:21,470
of Sachiko through Shizuo.

868
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:29,360
I felt like I could be transparent, just like the air around them.

869
01:38:58,280 --> 01:38:59,070
Hey.

870
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:05,540
I've been thinking a lot.

871
01:39:07,730 --> 01:39:09,510
I'm happy you met Shizuo.

872
01:39:24,690 --> 01:39:25,590
Take care.

873
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:30,640
Ow! What?

874
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:32,660
Goodbye.

875
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:10,920
One, two, three, four, five,

876
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:21,250
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

877
01:40:22,650 --> 01:40:27,240
11, 12, 13...

878
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:35,880
Sachiko!

879
01:40:40,830 --> 01:40:41,670
What?

880
01:40:44,910 --> 01:40:46,220
I just lied.

881
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:48,080
About everything.

882
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:54,110
Are you sure about Shizuo?

883
01:41:00,270 --> 01:41:01,100
Stop it.

884
01:41:03,650 --> 01:41:05,200
I love you.
