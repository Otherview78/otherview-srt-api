1
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,670
Got another one coming down, Mike.

2
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,010
Hang on a sec.

3
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,580
Hey! Argh!

4
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,150
{\an8}I got those concert tickets

5
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,150
{\an8}you wanted.

6
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,700
Oh, you're kidding.

7
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,450
For Friday night?
Stanley, this is great.

8
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,160
So, what time should I pick you up?

9
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,290
Well, see, here's the thing.

10
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,960
{\an8}My very best girlfriend just came into town,

11
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,960
{\an8}and I know she would die to go to this.

12
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,260
So, could we maybe get an extra ticket for her?

13
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,340
Ooh...

14
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,180
They're out. They're sold out.
That means there's no more.

15
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,470
{\an8}Oh... Well, I just can't let her

16
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,470
{\an8}sit home all alone.

17
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,020
{\an8}Look, I'll tell you what.

18
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,020
{\an8}Why don't you just go with your friend?

19
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,610
Stanley, I couldn't do that.

20
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,070
No, come on.

21
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,700
Stanley, you are the nicest guy.

22
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,450
- Ahh...
- Really, you are.

23
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,660
- Yeah?
- Charlie, isn't Stanley the nicest guy?

24
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,950
The best.

25
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,670
{\an8}That was the most sickening display

26
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,670
{\an8}I've ever seen.

27
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,800
{\an8}I disagree.

28
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,800
{\an8}I think I'm wearing her down.

29
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,260
{\an8}Buddy, you know what you need?

30
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,260
{\an8}You need a little change of pace.

31
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,180
{\an8}Tonight, I'm gonna take you

32
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,180
{\an8}on a love safari,

33
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,770
{\an8}deep into the darkest heart

34
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,770
{\an8}of the urban jungle.

35
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,810
{\an8}Tell me more, bwana.

36
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,730
{\an8}The Coco Bongo Club.

37
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,730
{\an8}Hottest new joint in town.

38
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,730
{\an8}Only the <i>crème de la crème</i>

39
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,730
{\an8}need apply.

40
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,690
{\an8}- So, how do we get in?

41
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,690
{\an8}- Are you kidding?

42
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,110
{\an8}- Leave it to me. Trust me, buddy.

43
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,110
{\an8}- Yeah.

44
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,740
{\an8}This is going to be

45
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,740
{\an8}the perfect night on the town.

46
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,250
{\an8}I don't have my umbrella.

47
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,250
{\an8}Hurry.

48
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,590
{\an8}Hold the phone. Killer at 3 o'clock.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,710
{\an8}Stand back and observe.

50
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,420
Excuse me, where can I open a new account?

51
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,220
{\an8}New accounts, right here.

52
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,800
{\an8}You know, you're lucky you caught me,

53
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,800
{\an8}I was on my way out to...

54
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,350
Could you hold this for me, please?

55
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,640
I will hold anything you want.

56
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,390
Thank you.

57
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,520
{\an8}Can you help me?

58
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,920
So...

59
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,170
What kind of account do you have in mind?

60
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,550
I'm not sure exactly.

61
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,510
You see, I'm just terrible with things like that.

62
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,930
That's an interesting tie, Mr...?

63
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,390
Ipkiss, Stanley Ipkiss.

64
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,480
{\an8}- Tina Carlyle. Pleased to meet you.

65
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,480
{\an8}- The pleasure's all mine.

66
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,860
May I?

67
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,190
- May you what?
- I'm such a mess.

68
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,320
{\an8}- Oh, of course.

69
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,320
{\an8}- Thanks.

70
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,660
{\an8}- That's what they're there for.

71
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,000
As I was saying about that tie, it kind of reminds me of one of those...

72
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,620
What do you call it? Um, inkblot tests.

73
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,590
- A Rorschach test.
- Right.

74
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,050
You know, it sort of looks like, um...

75
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,800
...a young woman riding bareback.

76
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,430
Sort of a Lady Godiva or something.

77
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,470
Of course.

78
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,890
What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?

79
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,060
Um...

80
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,110
I... I don't know.

81
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,780
Oh, oh.

82
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,990
Uh... It... Bright colors.

83
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,580
It's... It's a power tie.
It's supposed to make you feel powerful.

84
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,040
Does it work?

85
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,430
Now, how about that account, huh?

86
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,550
Uh, we have several different plans.

87
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,140
Savings.

88
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,440
Checking.
Savings and checking.

89
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,230
CDs, savings and CDs, checking and CDs,

90
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,150
savings, checking and CDs, T-bills.

91
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,030
Or we could just take all your money and throw it in a big mattress back there.

92
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,210
Now, I have some forms you'll have to fill out.

93
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,880
That's it, sweetheart.

94
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,050
Now, just a little bit to the right.
Beautiful.

95
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,140
Hey, will you guys keep it down back there?

96
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,810
No problem.

97
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,520
- So, what do you think?
- Layout's not bad.

98
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,980
But them motion detectors are a pain in the ass.

99
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,360
- But you can pull this off, right?
- Hey, you talking to the doctor.

100
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,360
I do have one question.

101
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,320
Which is?

102
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
What does Niko have to say about all this?

103
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,290
Nothing.

104
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,870
This ain't his grift, man.

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,370
Get real, man.
Everything is his grift.

106
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,630
He owns you, he owns this club, he owns this whole stinking town.

107
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,550
Things change.

108
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,840
You mess with Niko, you end up taking a dirt nap.

109
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,140
He's the only one who's napping.

110
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,600
And I'm about to give him a serious wake-up call.

111
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,900
But we need some cash.

112
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,730
So, first we take the bank, then we take Niko,

113
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,280
and then, my friend, school is out.

114
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,820
And this whole city is our playground.

115
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,250
Hey, bub, watch where you're going.

116
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,680
Hello?

117
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,970
- Hello?
- Hang on, hang on.

118
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,350
Don't get your panties in a twist, would you?

119
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,600
Hey, Burt, what the hell is this?

120
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,810
Oh, I don't know. Uh...

121
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,480
About 700 bucks, Irv.

122
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,950
Now, what can I do for you, bub?

123
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,990
I'm here for the Civic.

124
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,870
The brake drums are shot, and you need a new transmission.

125
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,660
What?

126
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,750
All I wanted was an oil change.

127
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,000
You're lucky you caught these problems now before they cause you some serious trouble.

128
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,800
Sign right here and press down hard.

129
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,680
- There's no price.
- There will be.

130
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,180
I don't have a car.
I have to have a car tonight.

131
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,520
- Ey!
- Yo?

132
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,730
Bring around the loaner.

133
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,640
The loaner?

134
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,690
The loaner?

135
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,430
Eugh!

136
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,760
It's a classic.

137
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,690
Hi. Charlie...

138
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,150
Stanley.

139
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,900
Gals, I want you to meet my buddy
Stanley Ipkiss.

140
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,200
- Humongo in the banking business.
- Not really.

141
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,910
Hey, what do you say we get in this joint, huh?

142
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,500
Yo, Bobby. How you doing, buddy?
It's Charlie.

143
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,540
- Charlie, how you doing?
- How are you?

144
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,420
- How you doing, my friend?
- Long time no see. Come on in.

145
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,750
Hey, good to see you. OK, then.

146
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,670
Come on, gals, let's get going.

147
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,760
See you on the inside. Oh!

148
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,340
Bobby? Charlie. Charlie!

149
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,600
Charlie!

150
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,770
- It's a mistake.
- You can't do that.

151
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,850
- Hey, hey.
- Whoa!

152
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,900
You crossed the rope.
Never cross the rope.

153
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,610
No, but my friends are on the inside...

154
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,280
- Lose him.
- Come on now, guys.

155
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Now, this isn't fair.
Hey, watch it, I'm a bleeder.

156
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,740
You put me down right now, or I am never coming back here.

157
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,160
Thanks.

158
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,920
Aw, jeez.

159
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,020
Mr. Ipkiss, hi.

160
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,230
Hi.

161
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,730
Are you OK?

162
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,360
Me?

163
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,740
I'm great. Really good.

164
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,030
I just...
I never felt better, really.

165
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,530
I'm just catching some air out here.

166
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,490
Your car, sir.

167
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,500
- That's not my car.
- But it matches the ticket.

168
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,000
Alright.

169
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,920
I'll take it.

170
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,840
But I am very angry.

171
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,180
You believe this?

172
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,730
You drive in in a Porsche...

173
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,300
Oh!

174
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,930
Jeez!

175
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,300
Oh!

176
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,070
Ugh! God.

177
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,120
Ugh!

178
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,910
Hey!

179
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,460
Hey, mister!

180
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,290
Hold on!

181
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,000
I know CPR.

182
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,210
Hey, you.

183
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,800
What are you doing down there?

184
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,090
Uh... I'm just looking for...

185
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,680
...my mask.

186
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,100
I got it.

187
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,650
Ipkiss! Do you have any idea what time it is?

188
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,450
Actually, no.

189
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,700
My new carpet.

190
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,790
Well, this is coming right out of your security deposit, Ipkiss.

191
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,920
- You know, Mrs. Peenman...
- What?

192
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,880
Nothing.

193
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,550
Well, that's what you are, Ipkiss, a big nothing.

194
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,520
Aren't you due back at the laboratory to get your bolts tightened?

195
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,060
I should've said that.

196
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,950
Hey, you. Milo.

197
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,200
You know, you're not supposed to jump up.
It's against doggy ordinance.

198
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,090
OK.

199
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,560
What do you want?
You want me to throw that?

200
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,150
I'm very tired.

201
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,110
OK, I'll throw it one time.

202
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,570
I ain't gonna throw it with you attached to it.

203
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,280
Ow!

204
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,740
You ready? Get it.

205
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,710
Ipkiss! Turn down those cartoons!

206
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,080
Alright, Mrs. Peenman.

207
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,970
'So, Dr. Neuman, you're saying that everybody wears a mask?'

208
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,890
'That's correct, Wendy.

209
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,890
'We all wear masks, metaphorically speaking.

210
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,930
'We suppress the id, our darkest desires,

211
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,940
'and adopt a more socially acceptable image.'

212
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,940
'Well, the book is, of course,

213
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,320
"'The Masks We Wear", by Dr. Arthur Neuman.

214
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,150
'Thank you so much for being with us today.'

215
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,490
What's the matter with you?

216
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,910
What is it?

217
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,160
What are you looking for, huh?

218
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,790
You like this thing? You like it?

219
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,290
"The Masks We Wear".

220
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,420
"That's correct, Wendy.

221
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,800
"We all wear masks, metaphorically speaking."

222
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,440
Yeah, right.

223
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,560
Smoking!

224
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,610
It's party time.

225
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,280
P-A-R-T...
Why? Because I gotta!

226
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,840
Shh.

227
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,930
Huh?

228
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,430
Agh!

229
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,570
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

230
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,950
Snooze.

231
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,810
Look, Ma, I'm roadkill.
Ha-ha-ha!

232
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,700
- Hey, get out of the road.
- I think he wants to communicate.

233
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,510
Hey, mister. You got the time?

234
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,180
As a matter of fact, I do, cubby.

235
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,020
- You wanna take him?
- I got him.

236
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,860
Look at that. It's exactly two seconds before I honk your nose

237
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,780
and pull your underwear over your head.

238
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,330
Whoa!

239
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,990
Come on.

240
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,620
- He's dead.
- Kill him! Take him!

241
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,090
Step right up here, don't be shy.

242
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:02,630
Nobody likes a bashful leatherhead.

243
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,880
Move it!

244
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:09,640
For my first trick,
I'd like to do something for you, son.

245
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,890
We have a giraffe.

246
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,190
There you go, son.
Now get out of here, you bother me.

247
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,320
- Thanks.
- Wow.

248
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,320
Now...

249
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,650
Sorry, wrong pocket.

250
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,530
For you, son...

251
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,700
...a little body English.

252
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,960
A French poodle.

253
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,210
Sorry, son, the dog was rabid.
Had to put it down.

254
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,460
And last but not least, my favorite.

255
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,100
A Tommy gun.

256
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,150
Run!

257
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,370
This is incredible.

258
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,370
With these powers, I could be...

259
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,000
...a superhero.

260
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:24,880
I could fight crime, protect the innocent, work for world peace.

261
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,840
But first...

262
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,730
Hold on to your lug nuts -

263
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,480
it's time for an overhaul.

264
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,670
Oh.

265
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,860
It was a dream.

266
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
It was a dream.

267
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,990
I gotta lay off the cartoons.

268
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,260
- Ipkiss? Stanley Ipkiss?
- Yes.

269
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,340
Lieutenant Kellaway, City Precinct.

270
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,430
Do you know anything about the disturbance last night?

271
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,140
Disturbance?

272
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,430
Yeah, some kind of prowler broke in and attacked Mrs. Peenman.

273
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:00,980
Attacked?

274
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,690
You didn't hear anything?

275
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:07,070
She unloaded a couple of rounds of 20-ought buckshot five feet from your door.

276
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,280
Look at the floor. See that?

277
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,110
He put that right in my floor, then he jumped out the window, officer!

278
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,450
- Jumped out the window?
- Are you writing notes?

279
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,490
This is... impossible.

280
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,370
Those pajamas are impossible.
This actually happened.

281
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:26,340
See, I have an inner-ear problem.

282
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,590
- Sometimes I can't hear anything.
- That a fact?

283
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,090
Eh?

284
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,850
Here's my card.

285
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,390
If you remember anything unusual about last night,

286
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,930
anything at all, call me.

287
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,690
You betcha. Thank you.

288
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,770
And good luck, uh...

289
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,150
...cracking the case.

290
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,870
Oh, my God, I'm late.

291
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,250
Keys, keys.

292
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,590
Where's the keys?

293
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,920
Damn.

294
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,260
Milo. Get the keys.

295
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,550
Get them. Find them.

296
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,220
Get the keys.

297
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,360
Ow! Jeez!

298
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,440
I am so late.

299
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,660
Good boy. Good boy.
Attaboy. Come on, boy.

300
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,740
Give them to me. Drop it.

301
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,020
Easy!
Watch that bump.

302
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,320
- I want a proctologist standing by.
- 'What?'

303
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
You heard me.
The best one you can find.

304
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,450
I'm with "The Evening Star".
Can you tell me what happened here?

305
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,870
No, and you can quote me.

306
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,240
Well, it looks like some sort of mob tactic.

307
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,120
There it is, boys.
She broke the case.

308
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,250
Come on, get these rubbernecks out of here.

309
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,250
- Let's go.
- Wait, there's no...

310
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:32,210
- Officer, please...
- Can you tell us, sir, please?

311
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,760
Hey, Stan. Stan, Stan.
Where were you last night?

312
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,260
The girls and I were looking all over for you.

313
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:42,260
Did you happen to look outside in the gutter?

314
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,890
Hey, did you check the morning paper?

315
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,810
Your girlfriend got a great review.

316
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,810
Ipkiss, you're 40 minutes late.
Now, that's the same as stealing.

317
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,360
I'm sorry, Mr. Dickey.
It'll never happen again.

318
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,610
I've been a jerk.

319
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,490
Well, if you weren't busy ogling girlie pictures,

320
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,870
you might actually get some work done around here.

321
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,700
Uh... sir, she's a prospective client of Stanley's.

322
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,540
Oh, really?

323
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,000
Well...

324
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,500
The next time she comes in, you be sure to send her to my office.

325
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,840
You betcha.

326
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,970
Gee, I wish my daddy owned a bank.

327
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,390
Then I could be a rich little creep, too.

328
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,350
You think she'll ever come back, Charlie?

329
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,400
Oh, man, forget her.

330
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,980
Stanley, listen to me.

331
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,690
A girl like that is always looking for the BBD, the "Bigger, Better Deal".

332
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,110
You don't know that, Charlie.

333
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,280
She's an artist. She's...

334
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,450
- She's sensitive.
- Stanley, forget her.

335
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,660
That girl will tear out your heart, put it in a blender and hit "frappé".

336
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:53,580
You don't need her, man. You need somebody a little more down-to-earth,

337
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,710
somebody with some integrity, somebody with...

338
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,050
...red hair and full pouting lips,

339
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,720
a white blouse, a green jacket and a name tag.

340
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,100
Boy, you really narrowed it down.

341
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,350
Too bad she's already taken.

342
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,900
Hello there.
May I be of some assistance?

343
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,070
Stanley Ipkiss?

344
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,740
Oh, hi.

345
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,740
I'm Peggy Brandt from "The Tribune".

346
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,610
Oh, hi.

347
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,540
Look, I canceled my subscription because they kept stealing my paper from...

348
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,410
Oh, no, no. Actually,
I just wanna ask you a few questions.

349
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,210
Really? About what?

350
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,710
Ripley Auto Finishing.
You're a customer of theirs, aren't you?

351
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,010
Me? No.

352
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,300
I don't even have a car.

353
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,930
You know, because they pollute.

354
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,560
You don't own an '89 Civic?

355
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,980
Oh, that car, yeah. Mm-hm. Uh...

356
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,730
Yeah.

357
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,360
It's all coming back to me.

358
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,860
Miss... What'd you say your name was?

359
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,320
Peggy Brandt.

360
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,160
Wait a minute. Peggy Brandt?

361
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:10,790
- Of "Ask Peggy"?
- Yeah, that's right.

362
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,750
You printed one of my letters last year.

363
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:16,290
Remember? "Nice guys finish last."

364
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,090
- You're Mr. Nice Guy?
- Yes.

365
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,760
Oh, Stanley.

366
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,510
Do you realize how much mail we got about that letter?

367
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:29,470
There are literally hundreds of women out there looking for a guy just like you.

368
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,270
- Really?
- Yeah.

369
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:36,440
Do you know how hard it is to find a decent man in this town?

370
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,270
Most of them think monogamy is some kind of wood.

371
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,030
So why are you covering this story?

372
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,830
Because "Dear Peggy" pays dick.
I'm starving to death.

373
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:53,080
I'm looking to become a real reporter.

374
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,500
Look, Stanley, when you were at Ripley Auto,

375
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,460
did you see anything suspicious?
Anything at all?

376
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,050
I won't make trouble for you.
I just want the truth.

377
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:07,720
God, I wish I knew the truth, you know?
I really do.

378
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,140
No.

379
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,810
Well, if you think of anything, this is my number.

380
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,560
This is my, you know, personal number.

381
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,280
You really think hundreds of women are looking for a guy like me?

382
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,700
Sure.

383
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,820
I'm one of them.

384
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:32,080
I mean... Uh... Bye.

385
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,000
'One hundred twenty yards.'

386
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,840
Hello, Dorian.

387
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,600
Thanks for dropping by.

388
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,560
Yeah, well, next time why don't you call, alright?

389
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,140
Leave the delivery boys at home.

390
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:22,670
The cops tried to shut the club down this morning.

391
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:28,340
They say you've been using the place to run your own small-time scams.

392
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:34,510
I hear things like that,
I start losing my concentration.

393
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,220
And my game...

394
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,190
...it goes straight to hell.

395
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,650
You could, too.

396
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,690
Argh!

397
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,820
'Two hundred and five yards.'

398
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,070
I'm fed up with you, Dorian.

399
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,080
But I'm going to cut you a break.

400
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,710
One week to get out of town.

401
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,870
After that...

402
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,590
I'll use your empty little skull to break in my new nine-iron.

403
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,370
Mr. Ipkiss. Hi.

404
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,840
Hi.

405
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,550
You OK?

406
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,920
Your car, sir.

407
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
I am now.

408
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:17,160
Tina, come on.

409
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,700
We can't.

410
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,830
We can't.

411
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,120
Ugh! Milo!

412
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,250
Oh! Go on.

413
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,790
Ugh!

414
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,300
I don't believe it.

415
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,150
Stupid.

416
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,280
She would never...

417
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,430
No way.

418
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:58,010
Hold on, sugar.
Daddy's got a sweet tooth tonight.

419
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,760
Ha-ha-ha!

420
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,980
Ooh!

421
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,280
Somebody stop me.

422
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,780
Uh-oh.

423
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,290
Can't make the scene if you don't have the green.

424
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:28,040
I better make a little stop.

425
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,140
- 'How's it going, Freeze?'
- It's looking good here, my man.

426
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,350
OK, you boys are on your own now.

427
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,470
I gotta get downstairs and make sure I'm seen.

428
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,140
Do it.
The doctor is about to operate.

429
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,170
Sorry, fellas. Waste not, want not.

430
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,270
Cops!

431
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,320
I have a reservation.
Come on, dude.

432
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,320
You're not on the list, you're not in the club, alright?

433
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:01,170
- Oh...
- How do?

434
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,220
Uh...

435
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,640
Are you on the list?

436
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,810
No, but I believe my friends are.

437
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,890
Perhaps you know them.

438
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,940
Franklin, Grant and Jackson.

439
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,860
OK, that's it, nobody's getting in!

440
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:33,330
And now we present to you the most beautiful flower of the Coco Bongo,

441
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,920
Miss Tina Carlyle.

442
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,560
Beautiful.

443
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,550
What the hell are you doing here?

444
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:07,720
We got trouble.
You'd better come upstairs.

445
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,090
Come on, let's go.

446
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,220
Let's rock this joint.

447
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,870
Smoking.

448
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,290
Oh, man... what happened?

449
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,720
Somebody hit the joint before we could.

450
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:16,300
Here, Doc.

451
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,810
Here you go, buddy.
Suck on that.

452
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,850
Son of a bitch!

453
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:31,070
Eddy, who did this, man?

454
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,030
Who?

455
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,030
Him.

456
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,620
Him. That's... That's the guy.

457
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,990
That guy dancing with Tina?

458
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:43,080
He's dead meat. Come on.

459
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,350
Ah!

460
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,540
I want this place cleared right now.

461
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:45,230
- Hello.
- Club's closed. Move it.

462
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,770
You think I'm joking?
Come on. Move it.

463
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:50,480
Party's over. Everyone, let's go.

464
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,900
Tina, get out of here.

465
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,480
- Come on. Get out! Party's over. Go!
- Get lost.

466
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,650
OK, twinkle toes.

467
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,160
I wanna know where my money is, and I wanna know right now.

468
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,330
OK.

469
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,790
You've got 17.5 percent in T-bills amortized over the fiscal year.

470
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,460
Eight percent in stocks and bonds.

471
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,710
Carry the nine, divide by the gross national product.

472
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,090
Fortunately, funeral bouquets are deductible.

473
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,970
Ice this deadbeat.

474
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,890
Whoa!

475
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,850
Shoot him.

476
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:32,110
Hi-hi-hi-hi.

477
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,360
Thank you very much.

478
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,280
Hoo! Huh!

479
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:38,820
Ah.

480
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,160
Oh.

481
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,830
You got me, partner.

482
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,050
Hold me close, Red.

483
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:00,680
It's getting dark.

484
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:08,980
Tell Auntie Em to let Old Yeller out.

485
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,820
Tell Tiny Tim I won't be coming home this Christmas.

486
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,610
Tell Scarlett I do give a damn.

487
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,660
Pardon me.

488
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,710
Thank you.

489
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:44,090
You love me. You really love me.

490
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,520
You're not going anywhere.

491
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,690
Drop it, Tyrell!

492
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,530
Hey, Kellaway.

493
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,030
Drop it.

494
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,910
Alright.

495
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:13,210
So, you got a warrant this time, or you just stop by for a nightcap?

496
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:17,210
What I got is probable cause.

497
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,710
Couple of your boys were spotted knocking over City Bank.

498
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,550
Easy, you're giving me a woody here.

499
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:24,260
And one of them was wearing a big green mask.

500
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,930
You know, for once, Kellaway, you're right.

501
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:29,390
Except it wasn't one of my boys.

502
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:33,100
Maybe if you tried a little actual police work...

503
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,560
- Cuff him.
- Hey, Lieutenant.

504
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,190
We got a stiff upstairs.
It's one of the guys from the heist.

505
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:41,150
Better call that high-priced lawyer of yours, Tyrell.

506
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,490
You and I are going downtown for a little chat.

507
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,530
Get him out of here.

508
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,840
Ipkiss.

509
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:07,720
Ipkiss, I know you're in there.

510
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:13,310
Police.

511
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:16,390
- Oh, my...
- Open up.

512
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,730
Oh, my God.

513
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,570
Ipkiss, I know you're in there.

514
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:35,370
Open up. Come on,
I'm getting blisters on my fingers.

515
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,620
Hey, Milo, no, no.

516
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,710
No, no, no. Stop it.

517
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:47,300
I'm coming. OK, I'm coming.
I'll be right there.

518
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:54,430
- Let's go, Ipkiss. Move it.
- Alright.

519
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,110
Hi, Lieutenant.

520
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:06,740
Listen, this isn't the best time right now. I just...

521
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,200
Won't you come in?

522
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,030
Where were you last night, Ipkiss?

523
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,750
Here mostly.
Is something wrong?

524
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,830
What do you know about this Mask character?

525
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,750
- Mask?
- Don't insult my intelligence, Ipkiss.

526
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,630
He robs the bank you work in, and then I find this in the Coco Bongo.

527
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,340
There can't be two idiots with pajamas like these.

528
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,640
Milo, no!

529
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,930
May I see those pajamas, Mr. Ipkiss?

530
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,890
Those pajamas?

531
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,900
Those pajamas were...

532
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,230
...stolen.

533
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:45,940
Somebody stole your pajamas?

534
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,700
Yeah.

535
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,490
I mean, what is...?
What is this city coming to

536
00:47:55,620 --> 00:48:01,330
when, uh... when a man's pajama drawer is no longer safe?

537
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:09,380
Wow, look at that guy.
Nobody's that fast at my bank.

538
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:11,470
I'll say.

539
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,140
I don't know, boss, that's one hell of a rubber mask.

540
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,520
What do the lab reports say?

541
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,640
We got some fingerprints on some of the currency,

542
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,980
but nothing matches Tyrell's men.

543
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,770
Looks like this guy beat them to the punch.

544
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:27,030
Get the bank employee files and run the prints on a guy named Ipkiss.

545
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,650
Stanley Ipkiss.

546
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,240
- Ah. You figure it was an inside job?
- That's right,

547
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,910
and all I need is a couple of prints to lock this whack job up till doomsday.

548
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:39,410
Fifty grand.

549
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,710
Fifty grand to the man who finds that green-faced son of a bitch

550
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:44,130
before the cops do.

551
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:47,460
I want you to get the word out to every street hustler,

552
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:49,420
to every lowlife in this town.

553
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:53,680
You understand?
I want him here tomorrow, alive.

554
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,800
You're still here?

555
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:59,020
Come on, let's go!

556
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:06,730
- What are you looking at?
- You.

557
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,440
You're losing it, Dorian.

558
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:12,070
Oh, no.
I'm not losing anything.

559
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,200
Except maybe some extra baggage around here.

560
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:15,990
What is that supposed to mean?

561
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,330
You know, you weren't putting up much of a fight

562
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,540
with that freak show last night when he tried to kiss you.

563
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,000
Did it look like I had much of a choice?

564
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,920
Maybe you did...

565
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:33,050
...maybe you didn't.
Who knows, right?

566
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:35,720
I'll tell you one thing.

567
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:40,140
It's gonna be payback for anybody who crosses me.

568
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,730
Ipkiss.

569
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:54,320
We have a crisis on our hands here, and you stroll in over an hour late?

570
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,410
If I have to put up with your slovenly behavior...

571
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,410
Back off, monkey boy...

572
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,490
...before I tell your daddy

573
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,040
you're running this place like it's your own personal piggy bank.

574
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,040
Or maybe we should call the IRS

575
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,290
and see if we can arrange a little vacation for you at Club Fed!

576
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:13,760
That'll be all, Ipkiss.

577
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:22,140
Genius. That was genius.
Buddy, I have chills.

578
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:26,100
God. What side of whose bed did you wake up on, man?

579
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:27,900
I'm not sure.

580
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,110
I haven't exactly been myself lately.

581
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:33,150
Well, you don't look real fabulous, Stan.

582
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,610
Really? Do I look bad?

583
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:40,030
Ah. Not to worry. This will put the color back in your cheeks, my friend.

584
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,410
Two tickets to the charity ball at the Coco Bongo Club this Saturday night.

585
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:47,000
Anybody who's anybody will be there.

586
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,750
Wanna be my date?

587
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,250
I don't know, Charlie, I...

588
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,880
Wait just a minute.

589
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:01,850
- Tina, what are you doing here?
- I just wanted to thank you, but um...

590
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,390
...I'm not sure if I'm gonna have much to open an account with anymore.

591
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,770
Well, what about the club?
I thought you were doing great.

592
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,270
Look, it's not your problem.
I'll be OK.

593
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,860
Tina, come here.

594
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,070
You didn't stop by just to see me, did you?

595
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,540
It's OK, tell me.

596
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:30,920
The guy they say robbed this place...

597
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,840
- The Mask?
- I think he was at the club last night.

598
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,970
Really? They say he's pretty...

599
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,260
...weird-looking.

600
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:47,310
Yeah, but you ought to see him dance.

601
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:52,440
So, did anyone find out who he is?

602
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,730
Why, are you interested?

603
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:59,030
Just curious, I guess.

604
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,280
Well, I better be going.

605
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:06,540
Thanks for everything, Stanley.

606
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:09,620
You'd like to see him again, wouldn't you?

607
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:17,170
I, um... wouldn't mind.

608
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:19,880
I know him, you know.

609
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:21,680
You do?

610
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,890
We're old college buddies, him and me.

611
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:29,600
It's funny you should mention the way he dances because...

612
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:36,770
...I taught him a couple of dance moves myself.

613
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,990
Do you think you could have him meet me tonight?

614
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:42,200
I might be able to work something out.

615
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,200
- How about at Landfill Park?
- OK. Sunset?

616
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,330
- Perfect.
- Super.

617
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,750
Thanks, Stanley.
You really are a nice guy.

618
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,050
This is an interesting piece, Mr. Ipkiss.

619
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:04,340
Looks like fourth- or fifth-century
Scandinavian.

620
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:08,810
Possibly a representation of one of the Norse night gods, maybe Loki.

621
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,480
Loki?

622
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,060
Who's Loki?

623
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:17,570
The Norse God of Mischief.

624
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:22,570
Supposedly, he caused so much trouble that Odin banished him from Valhalla forever.

625
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,410
Then he could've banished him into that mask.

626
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:32,540
I'm talking about mythology, Mr. Ipkiss.
This is a piece of wood.

627
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,080
But your book.

628
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:38,710
My book is about masks as a metaphor,
Mr. Ipkiss.

629
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,880
A metaphor.
Not to be taken literally.

630
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,760
You're suffering from mild delusion.

631
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:46,840
Oh.

632
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,640
Alright.

633
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:54,140
I'm gonna prove it to you.

634
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:58,270
But I am not responsible for the consequences.

635
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,240
Just sit back and enjoy the ride,
Mr. Expert.

636
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,610
You don't scare me, Mr. Ipkiss.
Go right ahead.

637
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,620
See you.

638
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:35,230
OK!

639
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:38,270
You said Loki was a night God.
Maybe it only works at night.

640
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,400
Mr. Ipkiss,
I feel I should warn you

641
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,730
that I don't work personally with really sick people.

642
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:46,740
There are private institutions for things like that.

643
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:50,660
However, if you would like me to arrange for a safe environment for you tonight,

644
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:53,290
- I can do that.
- No.

645
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,500
I've gotta see Tina.

646
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:04,710
But what do I do?
I mean, do I go as myself or the Mask?

647
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:10,300
If I tell you, you promise to leave my office right now?

648
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,600
Mm-hm.

649
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,310
Alright.

650
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:21,110
Mr. Ipkiss, go as yourself and as the Mask

651
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:25,530
because they are both one and the same beautiful person.

652
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:28,900
'Got the cross-check on the fingerprints for you.

653
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:30,610
'It's Ipkiss, alright.'

654
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:34,370
I'm looking at him.
Just keep the SWAT team standing by.

655
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:36,500
If this guy's half as bad as he's supposed to be,

656
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,710
we're gonna have a full dance card.

657
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:41,170
- Do you have the pickle relish?
- Doyle, get in the car.

658
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:43,840
- But I ordered onion rings.
- Doyle.

659
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,360
No, no.

660
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:12,740
Stanley, what are you doing here?

661
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,450
Tina, hi. Uh...

662
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:19,410
I just wanted to come by and make sure that you two got together alright.

663
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,370
That's nice.

664
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:24,670
You know,
I hardly ever stop by here.

665
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:28,170
It's kind of hard to believe it was just a garbage heap.

666
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,420
Yeah, it's, uh...

667
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:35,510
It's, uh... It's really beautiful right around sunset.

668
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,350
The methane emissions really pick up the colors.

669
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:39,640
Wow!

670
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:44,110
All those pinks and greens.

671
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,900
Uh...

672
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:53,160
My friend will be along here any minute.
I better go.

673
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:56,870
Stanley, wait.

674
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:59,200
Stanley. Stanley.

675
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,920
Hello, <i>chérie.</i>

676
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,000
We meet again.

677
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:09,670
Is it fate? Is it meant to be?

678
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,880
Is it written in the stars that we are destined to fraternize?

679
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:18,470
I'd like to think so. Ha-ha-ha.

680
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:25,600
Kiss me, my dear, and I will reveal my croissant.

681
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:30,900
I will spread your <i>pâté.</i>
I will dip my ladle in your <i>vichyssoise.</i>

682
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,070
- Ugh!
- Whoa!

683
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:37,120
She is so coy.

684
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,540
I love it.

685
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:48,670
Our love is like a red, red rose,

686
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:51,260
and I am a little thorny.

687
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:52,630
<i>Je t'adore!</i>

688
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:56,090
<i>Je t'adore.</i>
Shut the window, I don't care.

689
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:00,760
This is Kellaway.
I need backup, and I need it now.

690
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:05,270
Cigarette? No?

691
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:21,120
Now, like Napoleon,
I will divide and conquer.

692
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,710
Ipkiss, police.

693
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,080
<i>- Merde!</i>
- Freeze!

694
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,090
Put your hands up.

695
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:36,470
But you told me to freeze.

696
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:40,430
Alright, alright, unfreeze.

697
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:42,850
You're under arrest.

698
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:48,230
No, it wasn't me.
It was the one-armed man.

699
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,810
Alright, I confess.

700
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,360
I did it, you hear?
And I'm glad. Glad, I tell you.

701
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:57,780
What are they gonna do to me, Sarge?

702
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,030
What are they gonna do?

703
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,370
Sorry, son, that's not my department.

704
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:05,200
Search him.

705
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,920
Ow!

706
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,580
Where's a camcorder when you need one?

707
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,590
Well, looks like it's gonna be a long night.

708
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,760
- My wife's gonna kill me.
- What is it, Murray?

709
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:22,510
Cops got your pal Ipkiss staked out at Landfill Park.

710
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,810
Let me cover it, Murray.
I really need this story.

711
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:26,350
And then you can go home to Claire.

712
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,810
- Oh, I don't know, Peggy. Ramsey said...
- Woah! I will take care of Ramsey.

713
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:33,020
Thanks a million. I owe you one.

714
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,280
Really big sunglasses.

715
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,400
Bike horn.

716
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:40,240
- Small-mouth bass.
- Wow!

717
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,660
Bowling pin.

718
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:44,410
Ah-ah-ah. Argh!

719
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,040
- Mousetrap.
- Rubber chicken.

720
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,540
Little to the left. That's it.

721
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:52,290
- I don't know.
- Funny eyeball glasses.

722
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:54,590
I've never seen those before in my life.

723
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:56,920
- Bazooka.
- have a permit for that.

724
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,260
Picture of Kellaway's wife.

725
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,630
- What?
- Uh-oh.

726
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,310
Margaret! You son of a bitch.

727
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:09,890
Jeez, I figured you had a sense of humor.
After all, you married her.

728
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,570
That's gotta hurt.

729
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:16,690
Get him.

730
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,320
Doyle.

731
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,380
'It's all over, Ipkiss.

732
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:44,390
'Put your hands over your head, or we'll open fire.'

733
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,680
Hit it.

734
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,030
- Not bad.
- Shut up and help me down.

735
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:24,190
Alright.

736
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,720
Wow!

737
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:51,970
You start dancing,
I'll blow your brains out.

738
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,190
Give me that thing!

739
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:00,360
See you.

740
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,150
There he is.
Let's get him. Snap out of it.

741
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:07,360
Come on, this dance is over.
Let's go. Follow me, Officer.

742
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:17,080
He's down the alley. Follow me.
Come on, grab your gun.

743
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:38,100
Stanley!

744
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:39,810
Stanley, get in.

745
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:42,270
There he is.

746
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,400
Halt or I'll shoot.

747
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:50,450
Shoot! Shoot!

748
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,200
Seat belts.

749
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:59,040
I missed him.

750
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:02,670
Come on.
We all missed him.

751
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:10,300
I saw it.

752
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:13,010
I saw everything.

753
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:16,270
What's happening to you, Stanley?

754
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:20,560
It's crazy.

755
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:27,150
I'm losing control.

756
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:32,200
When I put that mask on,
I can do anything.

757
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:35,700
Be anything.

758
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,410
But it's wrecking my life.

759
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:42,750
My life is wrecked. Wrecked.

760
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:45,880
Wrecked.

761
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,130
Look, I don't know what's happening to you, Stanley.

762
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:52,840
But I do know this.

763
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,430
That letter that you sent my column.

764
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,390
That was from a guy with more guts...

765
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,270
...and more heart

766
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,900
than any of the creeps that I've met in this city.

767
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:09,070
Whatever that mask is...

768
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,320
...you don't need it.

769
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:16,780
You, Stanley Ipkiss,

770
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:21,000
are already all you'll ever need to be.

771
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,460
Gosh, Peg.

772
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,050
Do you really mean that?

773
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:34,930
Actually, no.

774
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:36,600
What?

775
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:41,520
What took you guys so long?
I've been vamping here for 20 minutes.

776
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:45,600
- Is this him?
- You got the 50 thou?

777
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:48,900
Give her the money.

778
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,200
Right.

779
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,990
When he puts on the mask, he turns into that green thing.

780
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:58,330
Peggy.

781
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:00,870
What are you doing?

782
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:06,080
Sorry, Stanley. You really are a great guy,
I just can't lose my condo.

783
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:09,250
You know how hard it is to find an apartment in this city.

784
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,010
Huh.

785
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,840
You said you wouldn't hurt him.

786
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:20,260
I lied.

787
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:29,650
Stanley!

788
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:34,320
What...? Hey. Hey!

789
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:42,580
Tell me, how does this mask work?

790
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:45,870
I don't know. You just...

791
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,870
...put it on.

792
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:02,470
Boss...

793
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,310
You'd better be careful, huh?

794
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,370
What a rush.

795
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,750
Huh...

796
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:29,920
Wow, boss.

797
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:31,670
You OK?

798
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:34,590
Better than ever, you idiot.

799
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:39,090
What do we do with Ipkiss?

800
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,180
The police are looking for The Mask.

801
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:46,270
So, we'll give them The Mask.

802
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,780
Money better be here, Ipkiss.

803
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:01,450
Or you can Ipkiss your ass goodbye.

804
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:10,210
Hey, Orlando.

805
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:50,460
Get over.

806
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,140
I still can't believe it.

807
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:04,970
Hardened cops dancing in the street

808
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,470
and broadcast all over the eleven o'clock news.

809
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,520
The SWAT team got an offer to open in Vegas.

810
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:12,690
I'm history. The captain's gonna have my badge for breakfast,

811
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:14,480
with a little pension on top.

812
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,480
Oh, come on, Lieutenant, it's not all your fault.

813
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:18,900
Something will turn up.

814
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,860
Sure, Stanley Ipkiss is gonna fall right into my lap.

815
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:31,500
- Get up. Get him off.
- Come on.

816
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:33,830
Argh!

817
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,540
Ipkiss.

818
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:38,630
Wait!
I can explain everything.

819
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:41,170
Oh, yeah?
You can explain everything?

820
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:43,720
- Explain this.
- Um...

821
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:47,180
Get him up. Come on, let's go.
I got a cell for you, pal.

822
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:07,070
Milo.

823
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:12,290
You better forget about me, buddy.

824
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:14,580
Find yourself a new place to live.

825
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,460
Looks like I'm gonna be in here for a long, long time.

826
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,770
Hey, you, with the face.

827
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,690
You got a visitor.

828
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:42,690
Tina...

829
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:44,780
Hello, Stanley.

830
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,910
- What are you doing here?
- Is it true?

831
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,290
You're The Mask.

832
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:54,120
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.

833
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:57,420
If I, uh... get a good lawyer and strike up a deal,

834
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:00,880
I can be out of here in about 10,000 years.

835
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:05,840
You're taking a chance coming here.
Your boyfriend might be a little upset.

836
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:11,550
He's going to the charity ball tonight.
He's gonna do something terrible.

837
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,930
Like what? The lambada?

838
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:18,190
Stanley, this is serious.
There's gotta be a way to stop him.

839
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:21,060
How does it work?

840
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:23,280
I don't know.

841
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,360
It's like, uh...

842
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:29,450
It's like it brings your innermost desires to life.

843
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:32,120
If deep down inside, you're...

844
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:36,200
...a little repressed and a hopeless romantic...

845
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,210
...you become some sort of a love-crazy wild man.

846
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:43,300
And if you're somebody like Dorian?

847
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:46,130
Then we're all in big trouble.

848
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:49,180
And if I were you,
I'd get out of town. Fast.

849
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,350
Thanks.

850
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:57,810
- For what?
- Lots of things.

851
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:04,020
For sharing a sunset with me.

852
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:07,990
For being the only guy who treated me like a person

853
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:10,530
and not some sort of party favor.

854
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:16,700
For being any kind of romantic.

855
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:18,540
Even a hopeless one.

856
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,130
You're welcome.

857
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:28,170
You know that night at the club?

858
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,930
I knew I'd found someone special.

859
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:37,310
- The Mask.
- No.

860
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:40,140
It was the guy inside the mask.

861
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:42,980
It was you all along.

862
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,650
You.

863
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:49,190
Stanley Ipkiss.

864
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,950
OK, lady, time's up.

865
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:55,830
Could I have just one more minute?

866
01:12:57,910 --> 01:13:00,210
I've gotta disappear for a while now,
Stanley.

867
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:03,920
I don't know where I'm gonna go, but I'll let you know as soon as I can.

868
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:40,790
Argh!

869
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:50,630
Somebody help me!

870
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:54,340
Oh, no. No!

871
01:13:55,470 --> 01:13:57,140
Guard. Guard.

872
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:00,470
Guard! There's a woman being chased through the alleyway there.

873
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,480
Come on, she needs help.

874
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,270
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Keep it down, Ipkiss.

875
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:08,020
Come on.
Serve and protect, man.

876
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:20,660
Milo.

877
01:14:23,870 --> 01:14:25,420
Milo?

878
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:30,960
Milo, good boy.
Come on, come on.

879
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:35,260
Jump up. Come on.
Can you jump up?

880
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:39,970
Remember how I taught you not to jump up on people? Forget all that.

881
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,020
OK, come on. Come on.

882
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:46,100
Get up here. Get up here.

883
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:48,900
Get up. Get up here.

884
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:51,070
That's it. You can do it.
Come on.

885
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:54,530
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

886
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:57,320
Milo, put some effort into it.

887
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,800
Baby, there you are.

888
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:18,720
I was beginning to get all worried about you.

889
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:22,890
- You have a nice talk with the cops?
- I went to see what Ipkiss told them.

890
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:27,140
Oh, that's right, you and Stanley, right?
You two are getting awfully close.

891
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:30,270
Maybe it was you who helped him out with the bank job, huh?

892
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,020
- That's ridiculous.
- Oh, is it?

893
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,900
Look what I found in her car.

894
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:38,610
Huh!

895
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:40,030
You planning a trip without me, baby?

896
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:41,820
- No, Dorian.
- No?

897
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:48,710
Boys, I want you to... pick her out something pretty to wear, OK?

898
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:53,840
Because we're gonna go to a party tonight.

899
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,630
We're gonna have one hell of a time, aren't we?

900
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,420
- Yes.
- Yes.

901
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:00,130
Get out of my sight.

902
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,810
Jump up. Get up. Come on.

903
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:08,520
Come on, Milo, jump, please.

904
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,020
Do it for Daddy.

905
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,650
That's it. Oh.

906
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:21,450
Come here. I can't believe it.
I can't believe you did that.

907
01:16:21,570 --> 01:16:24,740
Oh, good boy. Good boy.

908
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:27,620
Good boy. OK.

909
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,540
See that man over there?

910
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:31,290
He's got keys.

911
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:36,000
Yeah. Go get those keys.
Go get them.

912
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:38,760
Go get the keys.
Go get them.

913
01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:43,340
That's it. Yeah. OK, get the ke...

914
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:51,480
Oh. No, not the cheese, the keys.

915
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:54,980
Put the cheese down...

916
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:58,570
...and get the keys. Go on.

917
01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:01,070
Over there. Over there.

918
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,950
Shh.

919
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,300
Yeah.

920
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:21,720
Come on. Come here.
Good boy.

921
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,930
That's a good boy. Good boy, yes.

922
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:28,970
Oh, give it, give it. Give me the keys.
Give me the keys. Come on. Come on.

923
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:30,850
Drop it. Drop it. Drop it!

924
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:35,150
It's sundown. It's almost time.

925
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:38,780
Oh!
I wouldn't do that, darling.

926
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,610
Wouldn't want to start the celebration early, would you?

927
01:18:26,490 --> 01:18:27,570
Milo.

928
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:30,450
- Argh!
- Hold it!

929
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:34,660
I'm warning you,
I'm seriously stressed out here.

930
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:37,750
- Easy, Ipkiss.
- Come on.

931
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:41,170
Now, don't be an idiot.
You're in the middle of a police station.

932
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:44,510
There is no way you're walking out of here like this.

933
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:47,340
You know, you're right.

934
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,930
- You're absolutely right.
- What the hell are you doing?

935
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:57,440
You're gonna take me out as your prisoner.

936
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:00,440
Put it on. Put it on!

937
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:02,900
Ow. Come on.

938
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:05,240
- I'm really very sorry about this.
- I'm sure.

939
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,570
Milo.

940
01:19:08,950 --> 01:19:13,870
Got the wrong guy, I tell you.
It's a bum rap. I got my rights.

941
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,040
Hey, Lieutenant.
Where are you taking Ipkiss?

942
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,170
Ix-nay. E-hay's ot-gay an un-gay.
Ow!

943
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:21,750
Oh, I get it. Pig Latin, right?

944
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:25,510
Ee-say ou-yay ater-lay.

945
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:27,470
Come on.

946
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:38,060
Why don't you just sit back and relax, OK?

947
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:42,520
I've gotta change for the party.

948
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:10,010
No more bets, please.

949
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:16,350
- I need a pack of cigarettes.
- Which brand, sir?

950
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:17,890
It doesn't matter. I don't smoke.

951
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:21,020
But for you,
I would shoot the Surgeon General.

952
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:24,020
Mayor Tilton, may we have a word with you?

953
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:27,570
Well, I always have time for the press and my loyal constituents.

954
01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:07,280
Let me out of these cuffs, Ipkiss.
You're driving like a maniac.

955
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,360
I'm sorry, we're already late for the ball.

956
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:12,490
Right, Alice and the White Rabbit are gonna be really disappointed.

957
01:21:12,610 --> 01:21:14,280
Now you're being cynical.

958
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:18,240
Who the hell are you?

959
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:23,960
I'm just an ex-employee who's come for his back pay.

960
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,420
Or should I say payback?

961
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:28,590
Dorian?

962
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:31,840
Kill him.

963
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:52,150
Come on.

964
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:15,550
Ladies and gentlemen...

965
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:19,810
...I will be your host for the remainder of the evening.

966
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:33,490
Ipkiss, get your dog away from me.

967
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,200
I'm sorry, he seems to be attracted to you.

968
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:39,330
Wait a minute, where is everybody?
Something's not kosher here.

969
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:40,830
- Exactly.
- Watch it.

970
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:43,620
I'm sorry.
OK, I'm gonna have to lock you in.

971
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:47,380
- Use the radio.
- What?

972
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,540
You know, call for backup or something.

973
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:52,920
Milo.

974
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:56,930
This could be dangerous.
You stay here and be a good boy.

975
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,550
Daddy's gonna to have to go kick some ass.

976
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:06,730
He's a dead man.

977
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:08,100
- Down. Get down.
- Go.

978
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:10,230
- Come on, I ain't got all day.
- Move it.

979
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,480
- Hey, line up over here.
- Take it easy. I got the point.

980
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:16,360
- Come on.
- Move.

981
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,080
Blow it.

982
01:23:34,170 --> 01:23:36,050
Bastard. Argh!

983
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:37,800
What's the matter, darling?

984
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:40,050
This is your big production number.

985
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:45,270
And you know, it's important to go out with a big bang.

986
01:23:51,230 --> 01:23:53,020
Charlie.

987
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:55,650
What are you doing here?

988
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:59,280
Look, take this gun.
Start sneaking people out the back.

989
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:00,910
Right.

990
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:06,200
- You, step back.
- You don't you know who you're talking to.

991
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:08,660
I'm talking to a dead man if you don't step back like I said.

992
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:12,130
Don't you have respect for law and order? What kind of thug are you, huh?

993
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:14,250
It's all set, Dorian.

994
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,960
Excellent.

995
01:24:18,050 --> 01:24:22,010
This party's over... in ten minutes.

996
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:25,970
This is the moment of truth.

997
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:28,020
When a man shows what he's really made of.

998
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:32,940
- Crap.
- Drop it, Ipkiss.

999
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,480
Ugh.

1000
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,660
Smart dog.

1001
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,550
Hey, boss, look who decided to crash the party.

1002
01:24:56,670 --> 01:24:58,960
Hi, Dorian. How's it going?

1003
01:24:59,510 --> 01:25:00,880
Bring him up here.

1004
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:04,350
Dorian. Dorian, wait, no.

1005
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:07,350
There's no time for last requests.

1006
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:10,600
But all I wanted was a kiss.

1007
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:13,020
A kiss?

1008
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:17,150
Just one last kiss.

1009
01:25:17,270 --> 01:25:19,110
Dorian, I can't shut this thing off.

1010
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,990
There's always time...

1011
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:26,870
...for one last kiss.

1012
01:25:29,410 --> 01:25:30,960
No!

1013
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:34,420
From the real Dorian.

1014
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:37,460
The one I used to love.

1015
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,130
Nobody ever kissed me like Dorian Tyrell.

1016
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:45,340
Romeo, this whole place is gonna blow in a couple of minutes.

1017
01:25:45,470 --> 01:25:48,600
Just wait!

1018
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:54,600
I've decided...

1019
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,950
...to give her one last thrill.

1020
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,170
Get it.

1021
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:35,810
Run, Milo!

1022
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:37,770
I got him... Argh!

1023
01:26:39,230 --> 01:26:41,820
Stanley, hurry!

1024
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:45,530
Don't worry, Tina. It's all over now.

1025
01:26:48,990 --> 01:26:50,740
Stanley.

1026
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:57,540
Got you.

1027
01:27:03,090 --> 01:27:05,050
Argh!

1028
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:11,760
I'm gonna take you apart.

1029
01:27:12,510 --> 01:27:16,020
Well, I hope you can enjoy the victory with one frigging eye.

1030
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:35,370
Good doggy. Shh.

1031
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,580
Good doggy.

1032
01:27:54,390 --> 01:27:56,850
I'm winning.

1033
01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:02,940
Stanley.

1034
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:12,120
- Stanley!
- Come on!

1035
01:28:22,670 --> 01:28:23,920
Yes.

1036
01:28:28,470 --> 01:28:30,630
Get off me. Argh!

1037
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:33,470
Milo.

1038
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:39,270
Oh, my God.
This has gotta to be a new breed.

1039
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:41,850
Oh, easy, boy.

1040
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,610
Good boy.

1041
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:19,270
Did you miss me?

1042
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:28,150
I guess not.

1043
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:38,490
Now, you have to ask yourself one question:

1044
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:41,000
"Do I feel lucky?"

1045
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,330
Well?

1046
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,550
Do you, punks?

1047
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:01,310
Stanley!

1048
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:10,650
Ah...

1049
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:14,740
Ah!

1050
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:25,920
That's a spicy meatball.

1051
01:30:33,670 --> 01:30:35,220
How do?

1052
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:44,180
This guy's incorrigible.

1053
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:14,300
You were good, kid, real good.

1054
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:18,220
But as long as I'm around, you'll always be second best, see?

1055
01:31:38,700 --> 01:31:39,950
Police! Hands up!

1056
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:42,240
- Hold it right there.
- Get them up!

1057
01:31:42,370 --> 01:31:45,450
- Officers, arrest those men.
- Drop it. Get down on the ground.

1058
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:47,960
I've always wanted to say that.

1059
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:51,630
Come on.

1060
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:54,340
- Drop it.
- Give me that gun.

1061
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:03,100
They stole my jewelry. You take me down to headquarters, and I'll...

1062
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:05,020
Stop that man!

1063
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:07,060
Ipkiss!

1064
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:11,560
I've got you now, Ipkiss.
Watch it, chunky.

1065
01:32:11,690 --> 01:32:13,070
Mayor Tilton, I'm so...

1066
01:32:13,190 --> 01:32:16,570
- What the hell's wrong with you, Kellaway?
- That man is The Mask.

1067
01:32:16,690 --> 01:32:20,700
No, Dorian Tyrell was the Mask.
I saw it with my own eyes.

1068
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:24,330
- This young man here just saved our lives.
- With a little help from his friends.

1069
01:32:24,450 --> 01:32:26,790
- Oh, you're a real hero.
- Doyle.

1070
01:32:26,910 --> 01:32:28,750
Well, it's nothing...

1071
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:34,000
any American with balls of steel wouldn't do for his community.

1072
01:32:34,130 --> 01:32:36,380
Milo, come on.

1073
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:39,840
Hey, wait! That dog...

1074
01:32:39,970 --> 01:32:43,720
- Mayor Tilton, did you see that dog?
- Leave the dog alone.

1075
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:46,350
I wanna see you in my office first thing tomorrow morning.

1076
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:49,690
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Boy, that doesn't sound good at all.

1077
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:53,360
No, it doesn't sound good.
What would sound good to you?

1078
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:56,110
- Breakfast.
- Shut up.

1079
01:33:15,210 --> 01:33:17,420
You sure you know what you're doing, buddy?

1080
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:21,430
I'm sure.

1081
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:23,720
Then do what you gotta do.

1082
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:38,940
Sure you're not gonna miss this guy?

1083
01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:41,530
When he's gone, all that's left is me.

1084
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:21,400
Milo.

1085
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:29,490
Smoking.
