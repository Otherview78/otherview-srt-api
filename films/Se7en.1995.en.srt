1
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:03,146
Neighbors heard them screaming
at each other, like, for two hours.

2
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,482
Nothing new.
Then they heard the gun go off.

3
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:06,817
Both barrels.

4
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,237
A crime of passion.

5
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,072
Yeah.

6
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,825
Just look at all the passion on that wall.

7
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,911
Yeah, well, this is a done deal.
All but the paperwork.

8
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,542
The kid see it?

9
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,127
What?

10
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:26,962
The kid.

11
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,839
What kind of fucking question is that?

12
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:34,469
We are all gonna be real glad when we
get rid of you, Somerset, you know that?

13
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,681
There's always these questions with you.
Did the kid see it?

14
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,392
Who gives a fuck? He's dead.
His wife killed him.

15
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,353
Anything else has nothing to do with us.

16
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,864
Detective Somerset?

17
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,992
I'm Detective Mills.

18
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,578
Lieutenant, I apologize
for interrupting like this...

19
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,372
...just get in town 20 minutes ago,
they dump me here.

20
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,957
Look, um...

21
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,500
Mills?

22
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,378
I thought we might
find a bar someplace. Sit, talk--

23
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,422
I'd like to get to the precinct.

24
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:13,675
You know,
not much time for this transition thing.

25
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,596
I meant to ask you something,
when we spoke on the phone before.

26
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:18,972
Yeah.

27
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,725
Why here?

28
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,560
I don't follow.

29
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,772
Well, all this effort to get transferred.

30
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,692
It's the first question
that popped into my head.

31
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,736
I guess for the same reasons as you.

32
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:36,114
Or the same reasons you had
before you decided to quit, yeah?

33
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,202
You just met me.

34
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,413
Maybe I'm not understanding
the question.

35
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,208
It's very simple.

36
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,754
You actually fought
to get reassigned here.

37
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,298
I've just never seen it done
that way before.

38
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,884
I thought I could do some good.
It would be great...

39
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,762
...if we didn't start out
kicking each other in the balls.

40
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,934
- If you're calling the shots, lieutenant--
- Yes.

41
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,313
I want you to look
and I want you to listen, okay?

42
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,941
Now, I wasn't standing around
guarding the Taco Bell.

43
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,193
- I've worked Homicide five years.
- Not here.

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,403
I understand that.

45
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:19,116
Well, over the next seven days, detective,
you'll do me the favor of remembering that.

46
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,630
Hey, hey. I almost died.

47
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,239
Shut the fuck up down there!

48
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,383
Hello? Yeah.

49
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,968
Okay.

50
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,387
Say it again.

51
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,685
I thought we moved here
to get away from tractor pulls.

52
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,318
Serpico's gotta go.

53
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:27,364
Yeah, well, you might wanna get rid
of this little crusty.

54
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,157
This eye, Serpico.

55
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,784
- Did you get it?
- Got it.

56
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,285
Good.

57
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,011
Coffee? No?

58
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,560
Nothing's been touched.
Everything's like I found it.

59
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,396
What time was death established?

60
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,064
Like I said...

61
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,565
...I didn't touch anything.

62
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,736
But he's had his face in a plate of spaghetti
for about 45 minutes now.

63
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,656
Wait a minute.
No one bothers with vital signs?

64
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:10,991
Did I stutter?

65
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,536
This guy ain't breathing
unless he started breathing spaghetti sauce.

66
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,914
- So that's how it's done around here?
- I beg your pardon, detective.

67
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,084
But this guy's been sitting
in a pile of his own piss and shit.

68
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:23,420
If he wasn't dead,
he would've stood up by now.

69
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,755
- All right, thank you, officer.
- Okay.

70
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,757
Thank you.

71
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,852
I wonder.

72
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:45,066
What exactly was the point of the
conversation you were about to get into?

73
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,276
Don't know.

74
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:50,363
How many times has Barney Fife
found dead bodies that weren't dead?

75
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,408
Drop it.

76
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,642
Oof.

77
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:27,358
Somebody phone Guinness.
I think we've got a record here.

78
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,127
<i>Better Homes and Gardens.</i>

79
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,671
Oof.

80
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,181
Who said this was murder?

81
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,225
No one.

82
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,522
Guy's heart's gotta be the size
of a canned ham.

83
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:13,988
If this isn't a coronary,
well, ha, ha, I don't know.

84
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,841
Whoops.

85
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,349
How about that?

86
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,986
We had this case once.

87
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:56,030
Guy dead on the ground.

88
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,365
Knife in his back.

89
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,576
Gotta be murder, right?

90
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,412
Fuck.

91
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,790
Anyway,
big insurance policy involved, yeah?

92
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:10,670
So the guy took the tip of the blade,
stuck it in his own shoulder blades.

93
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:14,507
And he must've screwed up a few times
because there was multiples back there.

94
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,593
Could you please be quiet?

95
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,145
Wait a minute.

96
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,688
What?

97
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,234
Got a bucket here.

98
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:34,944
What's in it?

99
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,824
Agh!

100
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,910
Oh, God.

101
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,703
Fucking vomit.

102
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,290
Any blood in it?

103
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,501
I didn't see any. Help yourself.

104
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,634
Are you thinking it's poison?

105
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,179
Oh, wonderful. Very moody.

106
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,972
Thinking it's poison, Somerset?

107
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,601
You girls have got Forensics
waiting outside.

108
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:10,688
- Don't know if we'll all fit, though.
- There's room, light's the problem.

109
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,649
- Hi, how are you?
- Hey.

110
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:17,111
Detective Mills, would you go help
the officers question the neighbors?

111
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,325
- What?
- Send in Forensics on your way out, please.

112
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,968
He's dead.

113
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,012
Thank you, doctor.

114
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:52,188
You've seen my files, right?
You seen the things I've done.

115
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,815
Nope.

116
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,653
I did my time on door-to-doors
and walking the beat.

117
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,155
I did that shit for a long time.

118
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,032
And?

119
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,536
Badge on my belt says "detective."
That's the same as yours.

120
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,415
Look, I made a decision.

121
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,418
I had to consider
the integrity of the scene.

122
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,297
Couldn't worry whether you thought you
were getting enough on the playing field.

123
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,840
Hey, man...

124
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,594
...just don't be jerking me off,
that's all I ask. Don't jerk me off.

125
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,936
He's been dead a long time.

126
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,147
And I can tell you,
it was not from poison.

127
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,481
Oh, man.

128
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,817
How does someone
let themselves go like that?

129
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,571
It took four orderlies
just to get him on the table.

130
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,784
How'd the fat fuck
ever fit out his front door?

131
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,953
Please. It's obvious he was a shut-in.

132
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,538
Now, look at this.

133
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,248
See how big this stomach is?

134
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,251
And the strange thing is, it stretches.

135
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,629
Here. Look at the size of the cardiac orifice,
where the food--

136
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,883
Wait, I see what you're pointing out,
but that means nothing to me.

137
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,511
Okay. He's got lines of distention
across the duodenum.

138
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,598
And the interior wall is ripped open.

139
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,267
This man ate till he burst?

140
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,936
He didn't really burst. Not all the way.

141
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,564
He was hemorrhaging internally.

142
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:20,943
And there was a hematoma in the rectus
and transverse abdominis muscles.

143
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,445
So he did die by eating.

144
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,155
Yes and no.

145
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,867
What about these bruises up here?

146
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,537
Well, I haven't figured that out yet.

147
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,581
Gun pressed against his head?

148
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,083
Pressed hard enough, sure.

149
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,709
Fuck, yeah.

150
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,796
Marks from the front side,
flush with the muzzle.

151
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:45,385
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have ourselves a homicide.

152
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,807
Killer put a bucket beneath him,
kept on serving.

153
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,350
Took his time, too.

154
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,269
Coroner said this could've gone on
more than 12 hours.

155
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,731
Victim's throat was swollen,
probably from the effort.

156
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,776
And there was definitely a point
when he passed out.

157
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,487
That's when the killer kicked him
and he burst.

158
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,614
Oof. Sadistic fucker, huh?

159
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,200
When you want somebody
dead, you drive by and shoot.

160
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:12,412
You don't risk the time it takes
to do this.

161
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,373
- Unless the act itself has meaning.
- Come on.

162
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,335
Somebody had a problem with the fat boy
and decided to torture him.

163
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,503
Simple as that.

164
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,672
In the grocery bags,
we found two receipts.

165
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,174
That means the killer stopped
in the middle...

166
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,468
...and made a second trip
to the supermarket.

167
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,011
So?

168
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:33,349
Hey, man, it's his thing.
I've been out in the rain all day.

169
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:34,892
This is beginning.

170
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,353
We've got one dead guy, not three.

171
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,564
No motive.

172
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,526
Don't even start that big brain of yours
cooking on this, all right?

173
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:46,529
Please, I'd like to be reassigned.

174
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:47,738
- What?
- What?

175
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,867
- What, whoa?
- What in the hell are you talking about?

176
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,411
This can't be my last duty.

177
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,538
It's just gonna go on and on and on.

178
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,747
You're retiring.

179
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,083
Six more days
and you're all the way gone.

180
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,461
Won't be the first time
you've left unfinished--

181
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,173
Those other cases were taken
as close to conclusion as humanly possible.

182
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,716
And if I may speak freely?

183
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,217
We're all friends here.

184
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,888
- This should not be his first assignment.
- Oh, come on, I knew it.

185
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,182
This is not my first assignment, you dick.

186
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,433
It's too soon for him.

187
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,394
Hey, man, I'm right here.
You can say that shit to my face.

188
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,229
- Captain--
- It's too soon for you.

189
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,733
Captain, if we can just talk in private?

190
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,943
This isn't working. It's a personal thing.

191
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,653
- Maybe--
- Just shut up, Mills.

192
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,741
Look, I don't have anyone else
to put on this and you know it.

193
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,702
This is Metro. You don't just get to swap.

194
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,496
Give it to me.

195
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,956
- Say what?
- Yeah, he doesn't want it, fuck him.

196
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,250
Sorry, but see you later. Have a nice time.

197
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,086
- Give it to me.
- No, I'm putting you on something else.

198
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,132
Go on, Mills.

199
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,884
Just go on.

200
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,849
I'm sorry, old buddy.

201
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,520
But it looks like you're stuck
cleaning up the fat man.

202
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,497
All right, here we go. Quiet down.

203
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,417
All right, calm down. Calm down.

204
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,294
Quiet down.

205
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,838
Calm down. Quiet down.

206
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,841
Now, here's how it's gonna work.

207
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,929
I'll answer questions for 10 minutes
and 10 minutes only.

208
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:38,432
If those questions do not come in a calm,
sane and orderly fashion...

209
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,809
...I'm on my way out here.

210
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,811
Detective? Detective?

211
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,355
- Can I have a moment of your time?
- No.

212
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,196
I will not discuss the details
of this ongoing investigation...

213
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,948
...so don't even bother asking.

214
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,868
<i>I've got shopping tools...</i>

215
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,246
<i>That's 25 Berlin.</i>

216
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,086
That looks like him.

217
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,257
<i>Three items for your case number.</i>

218
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,262
- What you guys got for me?
- Nothing yet, boss.

219
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,394
Why don't you guys, uh,
go get a coffee, huh?

220
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,355
<i>We have this breaking story for you.</i>

221
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,399
<i>We're going to go live downtown...</i>

222
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,861
<i>...where defense attorney Eli Gould
was found murdered this morning.</i>

223
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:35,698
<i>District Attorney Martin Talbot
is taking questions from reporters.</i>

224
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,744
<i>There could be a conflict of interest--</i>

225
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,040
<i>That is ridiculous to the point of being
offensive. There is no conflict whatsoever.</i>

226
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,875
<i>And any claim that there could be...</i>

227
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,294
- <i>...is irresponsible.</i>
<i>- Mr. Talbot, Mr. Talbot.</i>

228
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,296
- <i>Hold on.</i>
<i>- It's rumored you're far...</i>

229
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,132
- <i>...from apprehending a suspect.</i>
<i>- I've come from a meeting...</i>

230
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,926
<i>...of law enforcement officials
and they've assured me...</i>

231
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,805
<i>...they have their very best men on this.</i>

232
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:05,144
<i>This will be the very definition
of swift justice.</i>

233
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,753
Pardon me, George.

234
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,718
- Somerset.
- Come in.

235
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:41,430
- Have you heard the news?
- Nope, haven't heard.

236
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,392
Eli Gould was found murdered
this morning.

237
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,312
Someone broke into his law firm
and bled him to death.

238
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,440
Wrote the word "greed" on the floor.

239
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,532
- Greed?
- Yeah, in blood.

240
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,076
Mills is heading up the investigation.

241
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,537
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me?

242
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,623
Could you not do that, please?

243
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,166
Oh, okay.

244
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,128
Well, good for him.

245
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,631
What in the hell are you gonna do
with yourself out there, Somerset?

246
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,758
Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm.

247
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,135
Fix my house.

248
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,970
Don't you feel it?

249
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,305
Don't you feel that feeling?

250
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,434
You're not gonna be a cop anymore.

251
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,644
That's the whole idea.

252
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,939
I don't think you're leaving.

253
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,650
Hell, you can't leave all this.

254
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,571
Guy's out walking his dog.

255
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,448
Gets attacked.

256
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,325
His watch is taken, his wallet.

257
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,912
While he's lying there
on the sidewalk, helpless...

258
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,374
...his attacker stabs him in both eyes.

259
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,295
This happened just last night
about four blocks from here.

260
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,339
Yeah, I read about it.

261
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:01,135
- I don't understand this place any longer.
- It's the way it's always been.

262
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,511
Maybe you're right.

263
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,013
You do this work.

264
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,850
You were made for it
and I don't think you can deny that.

265
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,561
Maybe I'm wrong.

266
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:15,149
Oh, uh, the coroner
sent this down for you.

267
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:19,361
Found them in fat boy's stomach,
mixed in with food.

268
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:23,449
- Looks like plastic, little pieces of plastic.
- Set them on the desk, please.

269
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,246
They were, uh...

270
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,456
They were fed to him.

271
00:21:30,456 --> 00:22:00,456

272
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,765
Oh, Lord.

273
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,984
This was found on the wall
behind the refrigerator...

274
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,320
...in the obesity murder scene.

275
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:30,117
"Long is the way and hard
that out of hell leads up to light."

276
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,119
It's from Milton.

277
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,204
<i>Paradise Lost.</i>

278
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,415
All right, I'm confused.

279
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:39,418
It means that this is beginning.

280
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,588
This was found
behind the same refrigerator.

281
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,882
Written in grease.

282
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,760
There are seven deadly sins, captain.

283
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,595
Gluttony.

284
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,515
Greed.

285
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,979
Sloth, wrath, pride, lust...

286
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:01,857
...and envy.

287
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,234
- Seven.
- Hold on.

288
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,612
This is not even my desk.

289
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,782
You can expect five more of these.

290
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,618
Now, wait a minute.

291
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,789
I can't get involved in this.

292
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,084
Somerset.

293
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,961
He wanted it.

294
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,256
- Damn.
- I'm all over it.

295
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,885
What's wrong with you?

296
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,667
Where you headed?

297
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,588
Far away from here.

298
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,392
- Thanks, George.
- How you doing?

299
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,185
Just a few things to look up.

300
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,271
Okay. Sit where you'd like.

301
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,815
How's everybody?

302
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,110
Hi, Smiley.

303
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,779
Come on, George,
the cards are getting cold.

304
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,281
Duty calls.

305
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,466
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

306
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,009
I'll never understand.

307
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,137
All these books...

308
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,639
...a world of knowledge
at your fingertips.

309
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,391
What do you do?

310
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,310
You play poker all night.

311
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,645
Hey, we got culture.

312
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,814
Yeah, we got culture
coming out of our asses.

313
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,818
All right.

314
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,029
How's this for culture?

315
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,480
You know, Smiley...

316
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,149
...you're really gonna miss us.

317
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,402
I just might.

318
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,878
Fucking Dante.

319
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:01,425
Goddamn poetry-writing faggot
piece of shit.

320
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,176
Fucker.

321
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,394
Yeah?

322
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,939
Good work, officer.

323
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,906
Thank you, Lord.

324
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,333
Oh, I'm sorry.

325
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,586
Be out of your way in a second.

326
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,850
- You want your chair?
- No. You go ahead.

327
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,435
Yeah?

328
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,475
Phone.

329
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,102
It's a package deal.

330
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,311
Comes with the office.

331
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:42,984
- Mills.
<i>- Honey.</i>

332
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,738
- Are you okay, something wrong?
- <i>No.</i>

333
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:51,201
You dingleberry, I, uh, told you
not to call me here when I'm working.

334
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,162
Yeah. Why?

335
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,914
Why?

336
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,376
- Why?
- <i>Come on.</i>

337
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,339
Okay.

338
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,010
It's my wife.

339
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,554
Sorry?

340
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,473
She'd like to speak to you.

341
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,277
Uh, this is Detective Somerset.

342
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,362
<i>Oh, it's nice to speak with you.</i>

343
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:30,198
Well, it's nice to talk to you too.

344
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,202
I appreciate the offer, but--

345
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:40,000
- Well, in that case I'd be delighted.
- <i>Great.</i>

346
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:43,170
- Yes, thank you very much.
- <i>Thank you. See you later.</i>

347
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,671
Bye.

348
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,175
Hon, what--?

349
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:57,851
Well?

350
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,395
- Sorry? Oh, uh.
- What?

351
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:03,106
I've been invited to a late supper
at your apartment.

352
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,691
I accepted.

353
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,235
At my-- How's that?

354
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,987
Tonight.

355
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,491
<i>Twenty-one-fifty-seven.</i>

356
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,537
Hello, men.

357
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,873
- Hi, loser.
- Hi, idiot.

358
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,876
This is Tracy.

359
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,129
- Somerset.
- Hello.

360
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:29,799
I'm very happy to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

361
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,927
Except, of course, your first name.

362
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,554
It's William.

363
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:39,017
Hmm, well, it's a good name, William.

364
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,436
William, I'd like you to meet David.

365
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:44,147
- David, this is William.
- Okay, all right, I'm gonna--

366
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:45,440
I'll be right back.

367
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,734
- How are the kids?
- Good, they're in the room.

368
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:49,361
Come on in.

369
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,322
Oh, good dogs.

370
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:55,367
How are you, good dogs?
How are you, pretty?

371
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,120
How are you?

372
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,457
How are you?

373
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,709
You are?

374
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,296
- Smells good.
- What?

375
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,881
- Uh.
- Oh.

376
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,675
Yeah. I mean, thank you.

377
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,721
Um, please have a seat, if you like.
Would you like something to drink?

378
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,348
Uh, no. No, thanks.

379
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:21,017
- I'll wait.
- Okay, you can just throw that anywhere.

380
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:25,522
You'll have to excuse all this mess.
You know, we're still unpacking.

381
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,985
I understand you two
were high school sweethearts.

382
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,319
Mm-hm.

383
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,739
Pretty hokey, huh?

384
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,325
You know something?

385
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:40,704
I knew on our first date
that this was the guy I was gonna marry.

386
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,414
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

387
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,917
He was the funniest guy I'd ever met.

388
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,298
Really?

389
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,928
Well, it's kind of rare nowadays,
you know.

390
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,849
I mean, that level of commitment.

391
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,147
Oh, don't worry.

392
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:10,191
- I won't wear it to the dinner table.
- No, ha, ha.

393
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,862
I, uh-- You know, no matter how
often I see guns, I just--

394
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,990
I can't get used to them.

395
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:18,908
Same here.

396
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,879
Why aren't you married, William?

397
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,214
Oh, Trace, what the hell?

398
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,508
I was close once.

399
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:37,302
It just didn't happen.

400
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,763
It surprises me.

401
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,931
It really does.

402
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,392
Well...

403
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:49,856
Anyone who spends a significant amount
of time with me finds me disagreeable.

404
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,816
Just ask your husband.

405
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,318
Very true.

406
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,737
Very, very true.

407
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,531
So how long have you lived here?

408
00:35:58,948 --> 00:35:59,991
Too long.

409
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,288
How are you liking it?

410
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:11,586
You know, takes time, settle in.

411
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,963
It'll be good.

412
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,257
Well, you get numb after awhile.

413
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,094
There are things to any city.

414
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,935
Subway.

415
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:30,063
- It will go away in a minute.
- It's nothing.

416
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,901
Real estate guy.

417
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:36,403
Fucking piece of...

418
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,363
Sorry, honey. He's...

419
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,865
He shows us the place a few times.

420
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,909
I think he's good. He's efficient.

421
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:44,953
Tracy really likes him.

422
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,457
Then I start wondering why will he only
bring us here five minutes at a time, yeah?

423
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,334
We found out the first night.

424
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:56,756
The soothing, relaxing,
vibrating home, huh?

425
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,808
I'm sorry.

426
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:15,442
Yeah, all right, laugh it up.

427
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,530
I don't know why you're laughing.

428
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,536
All right, already.

429
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,791
The guy would've had to get in...

430
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,502
...before the office was closed
and security tightened.

431
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,504
Now, Gould would've been working late.

432
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,716
I'm certain. He was the biggest
defense lawyer in town.

433
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:40,925
Infamous, really.

434
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,303
Now listen,
body was found on Tuesday morning.

435
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:47,640
The office was closed on Monday, which
means the guy could've gotten in Friday...

436
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:52,061
...laid low till the cleaning crew left then
had his way with Gould all day Saturday...

437
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,773
...Sunday, maybe even Monday.

438
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,691
Hey, look at this.

439
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:59,110
Gould was bound, right arm almost free.

440
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,779
He was handed a butcher's knife.

441
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,574
Check out the scale.

442
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:05,992
A pound of flesh?

443
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,119
Yeah.

444
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,716
- <i>Merchant of Venice.</i>
- Didn't see it.

445
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:25,053
"This task done and he would go free."

446
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,389
I'm telling you that chair
was soaked through with sweat.

447
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,308
Of course.

448
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,770
The killer would've wanted Gould
to take his time...

449
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:37,440
...to sit and decide
which cut to make first.

450
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,108
Imagine it.

451
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,569
There's a gun in your face.

452
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,656
Which part of your body is expendable?

453
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,658
What about the love handle?

454
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,577
Cut along the side of his own stomach.

455
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,747
All right, let's take a fresh look at these.

456
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:55,208
Even though the corpse is there,
look through it.

457
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,085
Edit out the initial shock.

458
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:02,674
Trick is to find one item,
one detail and focus on it...

459
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,385
...until it's an exhausted possibility.

460
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,345
Just gonna get another beer. Beer?

461
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,722
Uh, wine, please.

462
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,774
He's preaching.

463
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,734
He's punishing.

464
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:26,865
The sins were used in medieval sermons.

465
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,993
There were seven cardinal virtues
and seven deadly sins...

466
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,452
...used as teaching tools.

467
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,122
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
like in, uh, <i>The Parson's Tale</i> and--

468
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,790
What's this? Uh, Dante.

469
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:38,167
- You read them?
- Yeah.

470
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,421
Well, parts.
Hey, remember in, uh, <i>Purgatory?</i>

471
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,965
Dante and his buddy,
they're climbing up the hill...

472
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,301
...they're checking out
all the sinners, yeah?

473
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,762
- Yeah, the seven terraces of purgation.
- Yeah, yeah, right.

474
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:53,182
But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.

475
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:57,353
Yeah, well, for now, let's just consider
that the books were the killer's inspiration.

476
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,982
The sermons
were about atonement for sin.

477
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,276
These murders are like forced attrition.

478
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,029
- Forced what?
- Attrition.

479
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,990
It's when you regret your sins,
but not because you love God.

480
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:12,201
Oh, like because someone's sticking
a fucking gun in your face.

481
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,828
Mm-hm.

482
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,583
- No fingerprints.
- Nope.

483
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,003
- Totally unrelated victims.
- Yup.

484
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,631
And no witnesses of any kind.

485
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,466
Which I don't get.

486
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,886
Because the fucker had to get back out.

487
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:34,974
Well, in any major city,
minding your own business is a science.

488
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:39,020
The first thing they teach women
in rape prevention is never cry for help.

489
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,356
Always yell "Fire."

490
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,815
Nobody answers to "Help."

491
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,901
You holler "fire," they come running.

492
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:46,736
That's fucked up.

493
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:50,198
He must've left another puzzle piece.

494
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,909
You know what?

495
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:56,371
Thank you for talking this out,
but I gotta sleep.

496
00:40:56,746 --> 00:41:00,166
- Walk the dogs.
- This is just strictly to satisfy my curiosity.

497
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:03,044
- I'm still leaving at the end of the week.
- Oh, shit.

498
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,837
No, wait, wait.

499
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,841
Gould's wife.
She was out of town at the time.

500
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,220
- So this means she saw something.
- What if it's a threat?

501
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,056
Well, I put her in a safe house.
She wasn't too happy about it.

502
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,859
What if it isn't something she has seen?

503
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:31,114
But something she's supposed to see,
but hasn't been given a chance?

504
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,991
Yeah, okay. What?

505
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,118
I don't know.

506
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,997
But that's the one thing.

507
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:25,668
Sign us in.

508
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,920
Gotta see Mrs. Gould.

509
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,423
treat me like a prisoner.

510
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:33,760
Why do you have a phone
if I can't make long distance phone calls?

511
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,011
Mrs. Gould?

512
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:36,596
Don't treat people like this.

513
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,103
Mrs. Gould, I am sorry. I truly am.

514
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,606
I don't understand.

515
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:51,861
Okay, I need you
to look at each photo very carefully.

516
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:56,991
Look and see if there's anything strange
or out of place.

517
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,159
Um, anything at all.

518
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,245
- I don't see anything.
- You're sure?

519
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,915
Please, I just-- I can't do this right now.

520
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,708
Okay.

521
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:07,752
It's got to be now.

522
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,213
There may be something
we haven't seen.

523
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:20,473
Wait.

524
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,892
- What?
- Here.

525
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,857
This painting, it's upside down.

526
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:39,242
- You sure your men didn't move this?
- No, no.

527
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:42,120
Those shots were taken before forensics.

528
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:46,666
Nothing.

529
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,211
There's gotta be something.

530
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:03,391
- Moved the screws to rehang it.
- Yep.

531
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,438
What the fuck is that?

532
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:12,275
Switchblade.

533
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,118
Goddamn it.

534
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:28,082
There must be something.

535
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:35,381
He didn't paint the fucking thing.

536
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:46,058
No, he's fucking with us,
that's what he's doing.

537
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,145
See this? This is us.

538
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,813
Yeah.

539
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,607
Just wait a minute.

540
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,153
Now Somerset's climbing
on the furniture.

541
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,280
Just wait a minute.

542
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,995
You're kidding me.

543
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,623
Call the Print Lab.

544
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,463
Oh, man.

545
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:22,970
Honestly, have you ever
seen anything like this?

546
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,098
No.

547
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,978
I can tell you, guys,
just by looking at the swirl pattern...

548
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,773
...they're not the victim's fingerprints.

549
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:48,496
I don't know, man.
I say he's whacked enough.

550
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:50,915
It doesn't fit.

551
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,460
- He doesn't wants us to help him stop.
- Who knows?

552
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:58,631
So many freaks out there doing
their little evil deeds they don't wanna do.

553
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:01,884
"The voices made me do it.
My dog made me do it.

554
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:03,844
Jodie Foster told me to do it."

555
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,598
You know, um, I've seen this baby take
as long as three days to make a match...

556
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:11,269
...so maybe you guys
wanna cross your fingers somewhere else.

557
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:17,358
You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould,
didn't you?

558
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:20,736
- About catching this guy.
- Yeah.

559
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,029
Hmm.

560
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,783
Wish I still thought the way you do.

561
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:30,705
Why don't you tell me what the hell it is
you think we're doing then.

562
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,332
Picking up the pieces.

563
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:39,338
We're collecting all the evidence,
taking all the pictures and samples.

564
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,465
Writing everything down.

565
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,302
Noting the time things happened.

566
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:48,556
- That's all?
- That's all.

567
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:52,768
Putting everything into neat little piles
and filing it away.

568
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,897
On the off chance
it will ever be needed in the courtroom.

569
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,361
Picking up diamonds
on a deserted island.

570
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:06,073
Saving them in case we get rescued.

571
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,578
Bullshit.

572
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:16,751
Even the most promising clues
usually only lead to others.

573
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:22,006
So many corpses roll away unrevenged.

574
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:28,179
Don't try to tell me
you didn't get that rush tonight.

575
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,598
I saw you.

576
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,267
We're getting somewhere.

577
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,159
Wake up, Glimmer Twins.

578
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,620
You've got a winner.

579
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:02,088
This guy goes by the name of Victor.
His real name is Theodore Allen.

580
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,924
His prints were found
at the scene by Homicide.

581
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:08,552
He's got a long history
of serious mental illness.

582
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,889
His parents gave him
a very strict Southern Baptist upbringing.

583
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:14,725
But somewhere along the line,
they fell short.

584
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,770
Now, Victor dabbled in drugs,
armed robbery and assault.

585
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:21,607
Spent time in prison here a while back
for the attempted rape of a minor.

586
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:24,235
But his lawyer saw to it
that didn't last long.

587
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,987
His lawyer, by the way,
is the recently deceased Eli Gould.

588
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,739
- Greed murder victim.
- Yes, sir.

589
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,659
We're gonna finish this thing up today,
ladies and germs.

590
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:35,830
Victor's been out of circulation a while,
but there's still a residence in his name.

591
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,706
You're not buying all this, are you?

592
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:41,836
- Doesn't seem like our guy, does it?
- You tell me.

593
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,505
Our killer seems to have more purpose.

594
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:14,827
You ever take a bullet?

595
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,664
Never in my 34 years, knock wood.

596
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:24,170
I've only taken my gun out three times
with the intention of using it.

597
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,671
Never pulled the trigger.

598
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,798
Not once.

599
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,049
You?

600
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:35,389
Yeah, but, no, I never took a bullet,
but I pulled my gun once, shot it once.

601
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:37,600
- Really?
- It was my first one of these.

602
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,977
We were a secondary unit.

603
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:43,230
I was pretty shaky going in.
I was a rookie then.

604
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,692
Anyway, we bust open the door
looking for this junkie and, uh...

605
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:49,236
...the fucker just opened fire on us.

606
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:51,197
One cop got hit in the arm.

607
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,451
Christ, what was his name?

608
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,787
Spun him like a top.

609
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,040
You know,
I mean, more like slow motion.

610
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,585
I remember...

611
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,087
...riding in that ambulance.

612
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,216
Well, he died right there.

613
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,426
Right there.

614
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,929
Christ, what was his fucking name?

615
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:30,986
- All rise.
- Let's do it. Let's do it.

616
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,406
Go, go, go. Move.

617
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,619
Okay.

618
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:59,306
Get up there.

619
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,093
SWAT goes before dicks.

620
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,720
Hey.

621
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,098
They love this.

622
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,434
Police.

623
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,811
Clear.

624
00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,523
- Clear.
- Clear.

625
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:50,899
Clear.

626
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,706
Clear.

627
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:15,466
Morning, sweetheart.

628
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,885
Get up now, motherfucker.

629
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:19,345
Now!

630
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,439
Get up, you sack of shit.

631
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,739
Oh, fuck me.

632
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:43,077
Dicks, you'll wanna
come take a look at this.

633
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,498
Dicks!

634
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,213
Oof.

635
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,422
Jesus.

636
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:57,633
- Victor?
- What the hell?

637
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,051
Yeah, it's just Victor.

638
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:01,178
- Call an ambulance.
- What is this?

639
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,597
- Hearse more like it.
- Also Forensics.

640
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,974
- California, get your people out.
- Go on now.

641
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,601
No one touches anything.

642
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,937
It's some frigging wax sculpture
or something.

643
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:15,275
"Sloth."

644
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,078
Oh, man.

645
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:28,038
Goddamn.

646
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,916
Those pictures were dated three days ago.

647
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,093
This must be the first one. Look.

648
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:44,430
It's dated exactly one year ago today.

649
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:52,479
I got a hair sample, I got a stool sample,
I got piss, I got fingernails.

650
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:58,569
- He's laughing at us.
- You got what you deserved.

651
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:03,073
He's alive, he's alive!

652
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,033
- That cocksucker's alive!
- Guns down.

653
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,162
- Still breathing!
- Guns down! Emergency on that ambulance!

654
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:17,087
Coming through.

655
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:28,432
- He's playing games.
- No shit.

656
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:32,144
Look, we have to divorce ourselves
from emotion here.

657
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:33,353
Oh.

658
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,522
No matter how hard it is,
we have to remain focused.

659
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,858
Hey, man, I feed off my emotions.
How's that?

660
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,819
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes, I can hear you.

661
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,613
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing?

662
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,365
- Closed crime scene, get out.
- I got a right to be here.

663
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,909
- UPl photographer.
- Get out.

664
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,828
- Hey, I got a fucking right to be here.
- Get out of here.

665
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,914
- Get out. Jesus.
- Fucking jerk. Fuck you.

666
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,707
- I got your picture, man.
- Oh, yeah?

667
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:55,334
- I got your picture.
- Yeah?

668
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:58,545
Detective Mills, M-l-L-L-S, fuck off.

669
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:01,006
- I'm surprised you can spell.
- Fuck you.

670
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:04,092
How do they get here so fucking quick?

671
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,637
They pay police for the information.

672
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:07,846
And they pay well.

673
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,682
Hey, man, I'm sorry, I...

674
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:12,518
Those, ugh...

675
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:15,395
- You know, they piss me off.
- It's okay.

676
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,065
It's impressive to see a man
feeding off his emotions.

677
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,074
A year of immobility seems about right...

678
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:30,160
...judging by the deterioration
of the muscles and the spine.

679
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,831
Blood tests show a whole smorgasbord
of drugs in his system.

680
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,249
Even an antibiotic...

681
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:39,628
...which must've been administered
to keep the bed sores from infecting.

682
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:43,757
Now, has he tried to speak
or communicate in any way?

683
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:46,593
Even if his brain were not mush,
which it is...

684
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,638
...he chewed <i>off</i>
his own tongue long ago.

685
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,225
Uh, Doc.

686
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,271
Is there absolutely no chance
that he might survive?

687
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:03,068
Detective, he'd die of shock right now
if you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes.

688
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:06,780
He's experienced about as much pain
and suffering as anyone I've encountered.

689
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,782
Give or take.

690
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:12,244
And he still has hell to look forward to.

691
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,537
Good night.

692
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:17,541
<i>Tonight we bring you
the Charlie Parker Quintet.</i>

693
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:20,711
<i>Featuring Sir Charles Thompson on piano,
Herb Pomeroy's trumpet...</i>

694
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:25,424
<i>...Jimmy Woode, bass, Kenny Clarke, drums,
and the alto saxophone of Charlie Parker.</i>

695
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:28,135
- Yeah?
<i>- Hello, William?</i>

696
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:32,014
- <i>It's Tracy.</i>
- Tracy?

697
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:36,518
- Is everything all right?
<i>- Yeah, yes, everything's fine.</i>

698
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:38,353
- Where's David?
<i>- He's just, uh</i>--

699
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,898
<i>He's in the other room.
He's in the shower.</i>

700
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,984
<i>Um, I'm sorry to call you like this.</i>

701
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:46,028
Oh, it's all right. Um...

702
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:48,030
What can I do for you, Tracy?

703
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:51,158
I, uh...

704
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,660
Um, heh.

705
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,704
I need someone to talk to.

706
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:59,333
Do you think
you could meet me somewhere...

707
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,001
...maybe tomorrow morning?

708
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:04,338
I don't understand.

709
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:08,050
<i>I feel stupid calling, but, uh...</i>

710
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:12,512
...you're the only person
that I know here.

711
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,014
There's no one else.

712
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:18,644
<i>If you can, just, uh, give me a call, okay?</i>

713
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,812
<i>I have to go now.</i>

714
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,690
- <i>Well, good night.</i>
- Good night.

715
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:36,828
I mean, you know this city so well.

716
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:40,958
You've been here so long.

717
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,211
It can be a hard place.

718
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:47,047
I don't know why I asked you to come.

719
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,176
Why don't you talk to him about it?

720
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:53,011
Tell him how you feel.

721
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:57,057
I can't. You know, I can't be a burden.

722
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,309
Especially now.

723
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:03,063
I'll get used to things.

724
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,190
You know? I think I just...

725
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:09,653
I wanted to talk to someone
who's lived here for a long time and...

726
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:16,201
I mean, upstate, you know,
it's a completely different environment.

727
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,373
Did David tell you
that I teach fifth grade?

728
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,208
Well, I did.

729
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,004
Uh, he mentioned it.

730
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:33,593
I've been going around,
you know, looking at schools.

731
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:39,766
But the conditions here are horrible.

732
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,102
What about private schools?

733
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:47,232
I don't know.

734
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:51,445
Why don't you tell me
what's really bothering you, Tracy.

735
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,241
David and I are gonna have a baby.

736
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,706
Oh, Tracy, I...

737
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,709
I don't think I'm the, heh...

738
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:08,170
I'm the one to talk to about this.

739
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:10,589
I hate this city.

740
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,928
I had a relationship once.

741
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:19,306
It was very much like a marriage.

742
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,311
We got pregnant.

743
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,105
This was a long time ago.

744
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:36,323
I remember getting up one morning
and going to work.

745
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:42,871
Just another day like any other, except
it was the first day after I knew about...

746
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:45,082
...the pregnancy.

747
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:51,338
And I felt this fear for the first time ever.

748
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:57,761
I remember thinking how can I bring a child
into a world like this?

749
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:02,182
How can--? How can a person grow up
with all this around them?

750
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,109
I told her I didn't want to have it.

751
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:15,904
And over the next few weeks...

752
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,324
...I wore her down.

753
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,954
I wanna have children.

754
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,710
I can tell you now that...

755
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:33,380
I'm-- I know, I mean...

756
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:39,511
I'm positive
that I made the right decision.

757
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:41,972
But there's not a day that passes...

758
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:46,601
...that I don't wish
that I had made a different choice.

759
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,315
If you don't keep...

760
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:57,237
The baby, I mean,
if that's your decision...

761
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,491
...don't ever tell him
that you were pregnant.

762
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:06,621
But if you choose to have this baby...

763
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:10,667
...you spoil that kid
every chance you get.

764
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:22,137
That's about all the advice
I can give you, Tracy.

765
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:30,770
I got to go.

766
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,606
William.

767
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,530
Thank you.

768
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:58,381
Victor's landlord said there was
an envelope of cash in the office mailbox...

769
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,634
...the first of every month.

770
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,556
Quote:

771
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:10,185
"I never heard a single complaint
from the tenant in Apartment 306.

772
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:12,979
- And nobody ever complained about him.
- Heh.

773
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,732
He's the best tenant I've ever had,"
end quote.

774
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,817
Yeah, a landlord's dream.

775
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,653
A paralyzed tenant with no tongue.

776
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,446
Who pays the rent on time.

777
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:25,492
- I'm sick of all this waiting.
- This is the job.

778
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:28,286
Why aren't we out there, huh?

779
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:33,667
Why do we gotta sit here rotting,
waiting till the lunatic does it again?

780
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:36,711
It's dismissive to call him a lunatic.
Don't make that mistake.

781
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:39,506
Come on, he's insane. Look.

782
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:43,635
Right now he's probably dancing around
in his grandma's panties.

783
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:46,763
Yeah, rubbing himself in peanut butter.
Ooh.

784
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:50,058
- How's that?
- I don't think so.

785
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:53,561
His luck will run out.

786
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:56,398
Not depending on luck.

787
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:03,113
We walked into that apartment exactly
one year after he tied Victor to the bed.

788
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,198
One year to the day.

789
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:07,659
- He wanted us to.
- Don't know that for sure.

790
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:09,577
Oh, yes, we do.

791
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,289
This note he left.

792
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,165
His first words to us.

793
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,007
Fuck him. So what?

794
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:24,050
He's right, so far.

795
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:28,722
Imagine the will it takes
to keep a man bound for a full year.

796
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:32,726
To sever his hand
and use it to plant fingerprints.

797
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:35,687
To insert tubes into his genitals.

798
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:40,900
This guy is methodical, exacting,
and worst of all, patient.

799
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:43,028
He's a nut bag.

800
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:47,449
And just because the fucker's got
a library card doesn't make him Yoda.

801
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:55,123
- How much money you got?
- I got like 50. 50 bucks.

802
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:58,251
I propose a field trip. Come on.

803
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:02,589
We'll make a list.

804
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:05,592
At the top we'll put <i>Purgatory,
Canterbury Tales.</i>

805
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:08,386
Anything relating
to the seven deadly sins.

806
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:10,013
- Ask yourself--
- Hey, wait, wait.

807
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,932
- -What would he study
to do the things he's done?

808
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,143
What are his interests now?

809
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,437
Jack the Ripper, for instance.

810
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:19,314
- Where are we going?
- Library.

811
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,497
Coupons, coupons, free coupons.

812
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:38,083
Discount-- Discount coupons.

813
01:04:39,376 --> 01:04:43,630
They must've had about 50
health violations during the last inspection.

814
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:48,468
Could you at least sit across from me?
I don't want people thinking we're dating.

815
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,637
Give me your money.

816
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:55,934
I'm giving you this, but for some reason,
I don't think I know what we're doing.

817
01:04:58,478 --> 01:04:59,979
Fuck.

818
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,024
- Hey, Somerset, how you doing?
- Okay.

819
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:06,653
- Didn't figure this was a ménage á trots.
- It's not a problem.

820
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,488
Sit down.

821
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:16,329
Only for you do I do this,
so it's a big risk.

822
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:18,998
So I figure we're just fair and square.

823
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:21,376
- It's a deal.
- All right.

824
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,090
About an hour.

825
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:31,136
Yeah, help yourself.

826
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:35,432
Well, that was money well spent.

827
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:37,684
Yeah.

828
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,651
All right.

829
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:50,029
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more
than I trust most people.

830
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:52,991
Well, good,
because I'm ready to punch you.

831
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:58,913
It's probably nothing,
but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.

832
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:04,502
The guy in the pizza parlor
is a friend from the Bureau.

833
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:07,630
Who, stinky man?

834
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:12,594
See, for years the FBi's been hooked
into the library system, keeping records.

835
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:17,098
- Mm-hm. Assessing fines?
- No, monitoring reading habits.

836
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:18,600
- Look.
- What?

837
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:20,643
Certain books are flagged.

838
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:25,398
Books on, say, nuclear weapons
and, well, <i>Mein Kampf.</i>

839
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:27,442
Anyone who checks out a flagged book...

840
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:30,570
...has his library records fed
into the FBi's computers then on.

841
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:32,739
Wait, wait, wait, how is this legal?

842
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:35,742
Oh, legal, illegal.
These terms don't apply.

843
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:37,076
- Oh.
- You--

844
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:41,414
You can't use the information directly.
It's just a useful guide.

845
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:44,250
It might sound silly,
but you can't get a library card...

846
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:46,419
...without, uh, an ID
and a current phone bill, see?

847
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,926
- So they run a list.
- Precisely.

848
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:56,471
If you wanna know who's reading
<i>Purgatory</i> and <i>Paradise Lost...</i>

849
01:06:56,638 --> 01:07:01,643
...and <i>Helter Skelter,</i>
the FBi's computers will tell us.

850
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,770
- It could give us a name.
- It could.

851
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:07,774
Could get a name of some college kid
writing a term paper on 20th-century crime.

852
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,777
At least you're out of the office.

853
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:12,654
Get a haircut.

854
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:15,532
- How do you know all this?
- I don't.

855
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:18,826
- Neither do you.
- Exactly.

856
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:30,880
<i>"The Divine Comedy.
History of Catholicism."</i>

857
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:33,216
There's a book called
<i>Murderers and Madmen.</i>

858
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:37,178
<i>"Modern Homicide Investigation,
In Cold Blood.</i>

859
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,347
<i>Of Human Bondage."</i> Bondage?

860
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:41,808
- Not what you think.
- Okay.

861
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:44,143
<i>"The Marquis de Sade."</i>

862
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,145
- It's the Marquis de Sade.
- Whatever.

863
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,690
<i>"The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqua--"</i>
Something.

864
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:51,109
Saint Thomas Aquinas. There it is.

865
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:54,112
He wrote about the seven deadly sins.

866
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:56,864
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

867
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:00,326
- Let's try it.
- Jonathan Doe?

868
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:01,578
Whatever.

869
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,329
We're sure about that name?

870
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,497
Yeah.

871
01:08:04,664 --> 01:08:07,208
You saw it, John Doe.

872
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,794
You wanna go back, I'll go back.

873
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:12,213
Let's take a look at him. Talk to him.

874
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:14,507
This is crazy.

875
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:17,468
- Ah, we'll just talk to him.
- Uh-huh.

876
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:21,055
"Excuse me, sir.
Are you by any chance a serial killer?"

877
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:24,058
Okay.

878
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,102
You do the talking.

879
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:29,063
- Put that silver tongue of yours to work.
- No.

880
01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,482
You been talking to my wife?

881
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:36,654
This is retarded.

882
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:38,615
<i>Charlie's Fucking Angels.</i>

883
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,784
A name off a computer.

884
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,706
Mills.

885
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,632
Fuck.

886
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:59,552
- You hit?
- No.

887
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,641
He's going down, he's going down!

888
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,158
Fifth floor.

889
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:23,785
Mills.

890
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:27,413
Mommy?

891
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:29,415
Mommy?

892
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:44,722
Police. Is there a back way out?

893
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:46,265
Lock your door.

894
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:51,979
- What the hell is going on, man?
- Get out of the fucking hall, please.

895
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,881
- Get down.
- Aah!

896
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,133
Hey.

897
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:22,009
Get the fuck down.

898
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,206
Aah!

899
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:57,253
Shit.

900
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:01,174
Get the fuck out of there.

901
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:16,689
Hey! Shut the fuck up!

902
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:00,316
Goddamn it.

903
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:12,203
Fuck.

904
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:05,673
Get out of the fucking way! Move!

905
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:08,027
Mills?

906
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:10,696
No.

907
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,426
Mills.

908
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,890
- Mills, you okay?
- I'm all right.

909
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:41,727
I'm all right.

910
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:47,441
- Where are you going?
- I'm going in.

911
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:50,027
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

912
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:52,029
- Wait.
- What are you talking about?

913
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:53,572
- He shot at us.
- You can't.

914
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,533
- The hell we can't.
- We need a warrant.

915
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:57,410
We got probable cause. Come on.

916
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:58,744
Think about it, think.

917
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:00,413
- How did we get here?
- Huh?

918
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:03,791
- I can't tell anyone this, I can't tell anyone.
- Oh, come on, out of the way.

919
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:05,835
We have no reason to be here.

920
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,461
- Will you listen to me?
- Get off.

921
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:09,797
- Listen to me, listen.
- Get the fuck off me.

922
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:11,590
All right, all right, I'm sorry.

923
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:14,260
But would you
just pay attention a minute?

924
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:17,722
If we leave a hole like this,
we won't be able to prosecute.

925
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:20,558
The fucking guy will walk.
Now, is that what you want?

926
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:23,519
By the time we clear a warrant,
someone else-- No, fuck that.

927
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:28,024
- We need a reason to knock on this door.
- No, no.

928
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,317
Think about it.

929
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:33,154
Okay?

930
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:37,283
Okay, man. Okay.

931
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:39,994
You're right. I'm all fucked up.

932
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:42,121
When you're right, you're right.

933
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:54,216
Well, no point in arguing anymore.

934
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,802
Unless you can fix that.

935
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:01,849
You stupid son of a...

936
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:11,734
How much money we got left?

937
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:16,238
So, yeah,
like, I noticed this guy going out a lot.

938
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:19,325
When the murders was happening,
so I, um...

939
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,827
- So--
- So you called Detective Somerset, right?

940
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:26,123
Yeah, right, right, so I called the detective,
because this guy was creepy and shit.

941
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:29,001
And one of the murders,
it happened right over there.

942
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:31,796
- Okay. I told you the rest. You got it?
- Called the cops.

943
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:33,005
- Good?
- Got your story.

944
01:16:33,172 --> 01:16:34,882
- Have her sign. You gotta sign.
- Okay.

945
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:37,301
Okay? Good, good, good.

946
01:16:37,468 --> 01:16:40,179
- All right.
- You did good.

947
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:42,640
- I did what you said.
- Here you go.

948
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:45,351
You get something to eat, all right?
You eat.

949
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,564
Everybody, stay outside.

950
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:53,460
Victor.

951
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:08,721
Somerset!

952
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:13,225
- Somerset!
- Yeah?

953
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:19,315
- What?
- We had him.

954
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:21,275
What are you talking about?

955
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:24,903
The fucking photographer
in the fucking stairs.

956
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:31,869
We had him and we let him go.

957
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,793
You're sure this is him?

958
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,253
Yup, good, good. Yup.

959
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,088
- Yeah, good, get it out.
- All right.

960
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:46,425
Uh, we've got nothing, no pay stubs,
no appointment books, no addresses.

961
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,427
- This is the best, this receipt.
- Keep looking.

962
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:50,554
Let me show you something.
This was under the bed.

963
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:52,681
Uh, his only source of funds.

964
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:55,184
No kidding, we got his money.
Fucking A, I like it.

965
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:56,435
- One thing.
- Yes?

966
01:20:56,602 --> 01:20:59,563
You're probably not gonna believe this.
We haven't found a fingerprint yet.

967
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:03,734
- Um, not a single one.
- You're right, I don't. Keep looking.

968
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:09,990
We could use some more men here.

969
01:21:10,157 --> 01:21:13,577
Hey, man, I'm doing the best I can.
What are you getting with all this?

970
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:15,746
There are 2000 notebooks
on these shelves.

971
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:18,791
And each notebook contains
about 250 pages.

972
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:21,585
Forget it. Anything about the killings?

973
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:26,215
"What sick ridiculous puppets we are,
and what a gross stage we dance on.

974
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:30,302
What fun we have dancing and fucking.
Not a care in the world.

975
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:32,137
Not knowing that we are nothing.

976
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:34,556
We are not what was intended."

977
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:37,142
No, wait, there's a lot more.

978
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:41,480
"On the subway today, a man came up
to me to start a conversation.

979
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:46,151
He made small talk, a lonely man,
talking about the weather and things.

980
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:48,445
I tried to be pleasant and accommodating.

981
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:51,407
But my head began to hurt
from his banality.

982
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:56,537
I almost didn't notice it had happened,
but I suddenly threw up all over him.

983
01:21:56,829 --> 01:22:01,625
He was not pleased.
And I couldn't stop laughing."

984
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:03,961
No dates.

985
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:07,464
Placed on the shelves
in no discernible order.

986
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:11,468
Just his mind poured out on paper.

987
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:13,011
Looks like a life's work.

988
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:16,557
If we had 50 men reading in 24-hour shifts,
it'd still take two months.

989
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:18,475
I know, I know, I know.

990
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:23,814
Where's that phone?

991
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:28,777
Phone? Phone?

992
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,028
Phone?

993
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:34,950
People, quiet.

994
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:52,718
- Hello?
<i>- I admire you.</i>

995
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:57,139
<i>I don't know how you found me,
but imagine my surprise.</i>

996
01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:01,018
<i>I respect you law enforcement agents
more every day.</i>

997
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:04,229
Well, I appreciate that, John.

998
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:06,106
- I tell you--
- No, <i>listen, all right?</i>

999
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:10,360
<i>I'll be re-adjusting my schedule
in light of today's little setback.</i>

1000
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:12,946
<i>I just had to call
and express my admiration.</i>

1001
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:15,949
<i>Sorry I had to hurt one of you...</i>

1002
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:18,744
- <i>...but I didn't really have a choice, did I?</i>
- Hmm.

1003
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:20,621
<i>You will accept my apology, won't you?</i>

1004
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:23,207
<i>I feel like saying more,
but I don't wanna ruin the surprise.</i>

1005
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:31,006
<i>adjusting my
schedule after today's little setback.</i>

1006
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:32,508
Got it.

1007
01:23:36,929 --> 01:23:38,764
All right, everybody, back to work.

1008
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:42,184
- You were right.
- Hmm?

1009
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:45,938
- Ugh, he's preaching.
- Yeah.

1010
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:48,565
These murders are his sermons to us.

1011
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:52,277
Look, we know him,
we know him, we know him.

1012
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:56,823
Who's the blonde?

1013
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:02,454
Looks like a pro.

1014
01:24:02,621 --> 01:24:04,039
Maybe.

1015
01:24:04,206 --> 01:24:06,542
She caught John Doe's eye.

1016
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:14,341
Yeah, he came and collected it last night.

1017
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:16,009
- Last night?
- Yeah.

1018
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:17,636
- This man?
- Yeah, John Doe.

1019
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:20,013
It's an easy name to remember.
He had a limp.

1020
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,809
- What was this job you did for him?
- I've got a picture of it. Hang on.

1021
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:26,144
One sweet piece, actually.

1022
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,648
I thought he was one of them
performance artists, that's what I thought.

1023
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:35,571
You know, the sort of guy that pisses
in a cup on stage and, uh, then drinks it.

1024
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:38,115
- Performance art.
- Hmm.

1025
01:24:41,034 --> 01:24:43,203
I think I undercharged him, actually.

1026
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:44,621
You made this for him?

1027
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:47,499
Yeah, I've made weirder shit
than that. So what?

1028
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:55,215
They found the blonde.

1029
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,511
The picture.

1030
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:00,887
The picture.

1031
01:25:02,514 --> 01:25:03,932
Fucking pigs.

1032
01:25:06,059 --> 01:25:08,854
- We need you to move, pal.
- I'll come out, but you guys--

1033
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:12,357
- Get the fuck out of the booth.
- I've been in this cage the whole time.

1034
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,735
- Okay?
- I'm not fucking with you.

1035
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:16,653
Come on, this way.

1036
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,162
Can you do something
about this music?

1037
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:27,956
Yeah, we're working on it.
We're looking for the guy.

1038
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:42,387
You from Homicide? You--

1039
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:44,514
- You better see this.
- Yeah. All right.

1040
01:25:46,266 --> 01:25:48,769
Hey, easy. Got him?

1041
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:53,231
Get this thing off of me.

1042
01:25:53,607 --> 01:25:55,442
Oh, God, get this thing off of me!

1043
01:25:56,068 --> 01:25:57,653
Get this thing off of me!

1044
01:25:57,819 --> 01:25:59,821
- Get this off!
- Get him out of here, now.

1045
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,448
Get him out of here, now!

1046
01:26:02,866 --> 01:26:04,993
Come on, I wanna hear it again.

1047
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,413
- Tell me again.
- Just-- I don't know.

1048
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:11,917
You heard nothing strange,
you saw nothing strange.

1049
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:14,086
- No.
- No.

1050
01:26:15,796 --> 01:26:17,464
He asked me if I was married.

1051
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:20,676
- And I could see he had a gun in his hand.
- Where was the girl?

1052
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:23,136
The what? What?

1053
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:25,764
The girl, the prostitute. Where was she?

1054
01:26:25,972 --> 01:26:28,433
Someone comes to your establishment.

1055
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,436
They want to go downstairs
and wanna get a little ooh la la.

1056
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,105
Whatever.

1057
01:26:33,271 --> 01:26:36,650
- They got to come to you, yeah?
- Yeah.

1058
01:26:36,817 --> 01:26:38,193
You didn't see anyone?

1059
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:42,572
With a package? A knapsack?
Something under their arm?

1060
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:46,993
Hey, everybody that comes in there's
got a package under their arms.

1061
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:50,539
Some guys are carrying suitcases
full of stuff.

1062
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,333
She was just sitting on the bed.

1063
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:02,134
Who tied her down? You or him?

1064
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:04,928
Do you like what you do for a living?

1065
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:08,014
- These things you see?
- No.

1066
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:10,809
No, I don't.

1067
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:14,980
But that's life, isn't it?

1068
01:27:18,608 --> 01:27:24,322
He had a gun and he made it happen.

1069
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:27,868
He made me do it.

1070
01:27:28,034 --> 01:27:31,538
He put that thing on me.

1071
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:34,332
And he made me wear it.

1072
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:38,503
Then he told me to fuck her.

1073
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:42,174
And I did. I fucked her.

1074
01:27:42,966 --> 01:27:44,426
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1075
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:46,595
Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth.

1076
01:27:46,762 --> 01:27:50,390
The fucking gun was in my throat.

1077
01:27:50,974 --> 01:27:52,017
<i>Fuck.</i>

1078
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,605
<i>Oh, God, God.</i>

1079
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:59,649
<i>God, help me. Please, please, help me.</i>

1080
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:01,526
<i>Please, please, help me.</i>

1081
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:21,588
You know,
this isn't gonna have a happy ending.

1082
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:25,175
- It's not possible.
- Hey, if we catch him, I'll be happy enough.

1083
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:30,096
If we catch John Doe
and he turns out to be the devil--

1084
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:34,059
I mean, if he's Satan himself,
that might live up to our expectations...

1085
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:37,103
...but he's not the devil.

1086
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,232
He's just a man.

1087
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:42,734
You know...

1088
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:45,737
...see, you bitch and you complain
and you tell me these things. These:

1089
01:28:47,531 --> 01:28:51,493
If you think you're preparing me
for hard times, thank you, but...

1090
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,830
But you gotta be a hero.

1091
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:58,917
You wanna be a champion. Let me
tell you, people don't want a champion.

1092
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:01,586
They wanna eat cheeseburgers,
play lotto and watch TV.

1093
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:03,505
How did you get like this?

1094
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:06,883
- I wanna know.
- Ah.

1095
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:12,430
It wasn't one thing, I can tell you that.

1096
01:29:13,974 --> 01:29:15,267
Go on.

1097
01:29:18,478 --> 01:29:22,941
I just don't think I can continue to live in a
place that embraces and nurtures apathy...

1098
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:25,360
...as if it was a virtue.

1099
01:29:25,944 --> 01:29:27,445
You're no different, no better.

1100
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:30,407
I didn't say I was different or better.
I'm not.

1101
01:29:30,574 --> 01:29:33,618
Hell, I sympathize.
I sympathize completely.

1102
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:36,121
Apathy is a solution.

1103
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:40,917
I mean, it's easier to lose yourself in drugs
than it is to cope with life.

1104
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:43,128
- Yeah.
- It's easier to steal what you want...

1105
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:44,796
- ...than it is to earn it.
- Yeah.

1106
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:47,299
It's easier to beat a child
than it is to raise it.

1107
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:50,260
Hell, love costs. It takes effort and work.

1108
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:52,971
We are talking
about people who are mentally ill.

1109
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:55,849
We are talking
about people, fucking crazies.

1110
01:29:56,016 --> 01:29:57,475
- No. No, we're not.
- Yes, today.

1111
01:29:57,642 --> 01:30:00,896
We're talking about everyday life here.

1112
01:30:02,272 --> 01:30:04,649
You can't afford to be this naive.

1113
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:06,401
Fuck off.

1114
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:10,822
See, you should listen to yourself. Yeah.

1115
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:14,659
You say that the problem
with people is that they don't care.

1116
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:17,495
So I don't care about people.

1117
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:19,372
It makes no sense. You know why?

1118
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,833
- Uh, you care?
- You wanna know--?

1119
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,502
- Damn right.
- And you're gonna make a difference?

1120
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:28,965
Whatever, the point is,
is that I don't think you're quitting...

1121
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:32,344
...because you believe these things
you say. I don't.

1122
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:36,014
I think you wanna believe them
because you're quitting.

1123
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:41,102
You want me to agree and say,
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.

1124
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:43,229
It's all fucked up. It's a fucking mess.

1125
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:46,816
We should all go live
in a fucking log cabin."

1126
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:49,194
But I won't.

1127
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:51,488
I won't say that.

1128
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:55,742
I don't agree with you. I do not.

1129
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:00,914
I can't.

1130
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:12,175
I'm gonna go home.

1131
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:21,559
Thank you, though.

1132
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:53,591
I love you, honey.

1133
01:31:54,092 --> 01:31:56,219
So much.

1134
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:59,431
So much.

1135
01:32:03,727 --> 01:32:05,478
I know.

1136
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:10,001
911, what's your emergency?

1137
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:11,878
Could you repeat that?

1138
01:33:12,045 --> 01:33:15,507
<i>I've gone and done it again.</i>

1139
01:33:25,558 --> 01:33:26,768
What have we got?

1140
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:29,354
Uh, sleeping pills.

1141
01:33:30,105 --> 01:33:31,689
Glued to one hand.

1142
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:33,399
Telephone glued to the other.

1143
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:36,361
You see what he did?

1144
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:38,863
He sliced her up.

1145
01:33:39,489 --> 01:33:40,949
Then he bandaged her.

1146
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:43,535
Call for help and you'll live.

1147
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:45,995
But you'll be disfigured.

1148
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:49,916
Or you can put yourself
out of your own misery.

1149
01:33:50,959 --> 01:33:52,043
Come on.

1150
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:53,545
Cut off her nose.

1151
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:55,380
To spite her face.

1152
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:58,216
And he did it very recently.

1153
01:34:05,265 --> 01:34:06,724
Listen.

1154
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:12,397
I've decided to stay on till this is done.
I figure one of two things will happen.

1155
01:34:12,564 --> 01:34:17,193
We'll get John Doe or he'll finish his series
of seven and this case will go on for years.

1156
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:20,572
Hey man, you don't have to do me
any favors. Thank you, but I got it.

1157
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:24,075
I'm requesting that you keep
me on as your partner for a few more days.

1158
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:26,161
You'd be doing me a favor.

1159
01:34:36,838 --> 01:34:38,381
You knew I'd say yes.

1160
01:34:38,548 --> 01:34:40,008
- Hey, we're here.
- Wonderful.

1161
01:34:40,175 --> 01:34:43,636
Your wife called.
Get yourself an answering machine.

1162
01:34:45,805 --> 01:34:47,473
Detective?

1163
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:50,935
After this, I'm gone.

1164
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:53,938
- No big surprise.
- Detective!

1165
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:58,318
You're looking for me.

1166
01:34:58,776 --> 01:34:59,777
Hey!

1167
01:35:01,154 --> 01:35:03,615
Don't you fucking move.
On the fucking floor.

1168
01:35:03,781 --> 01:35:05,074
Keep away from him!

1169
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:06,951
- On the fucking floor.
- I know you.

1170
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:08,494
Now. Get down.

1171
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:11,915
Get down on your stomach,
you piece of shit.

1172
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:13,958
Now. All the way!

1173
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:16,294
All the way, fucker! Down!

1174
01:35:16,461 --> 01:35:19,005
Faster. Faster. Faster, fucker.

1175
01:35:19,172 --> 01:35:22,425
Now. Nose on the ground.

1176
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:28,056
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is this?

1177
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:31,392
I'd like to speak to my lawyer, please.

1178
01:35:33,144 --> 01:35:35,021
Goddamn it.

1179
01:35:36,814 --> 01:35:38,983
He cuts the skin off the tips
of his fingers.

1180
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:43,404
That's why we couldn't find one single
usable print in his apartment.

1181
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,907
Looks like he's been doing it
for a quite sometime.

1182
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:48,493
What about the bank accounts? The guns?

1183
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:50,495
So far everything's a dead end.

1184
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:53,414
No credit history. No employment records.

1185
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:57,335
His bank account's only 5 years old
and it was started with cash.

1186
01:35:57,502 --> 01:35:59,379
We're even trying to trace his furniture.

1187
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:01,965
About only thing we know about that guy
right now...

1188
01:36:02,131 --> 01:36:06,970
...is that he's independently wealthy,
well-educated and totally insane.

1189
01:36:07,136 --> 01:36:09,138
Because he's John Doe by choice.

1190
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:11,849
- Okay, so when do we get to question him?
- You don't.

1191
01:36:12,016 --> 01:36:13,851
- He going to court now.
- What?

1192
01:36:14,018 --> 01:36:16,479
I'm telling you,
there's no way he'd turn himself in.

1193
01:36:16,646 --> 01:36:18,273
It doesn't make any sense.

1194
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:22,026
Well, there he sits.
It's not supposed to make any sense.

1195
01:36:22,193 --> 01:36:24,862
- He's not finished.
- No, he's pissing in our faces.

1196
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:29,284
We're just taking it like idiots.
You know what I'm talking about.

1197
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:33,371
For the first time ever,
you and I are in total agreement.

1198
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:37,041
- He wouldn't just stop.
- Ugh, so, what the fuck, man?

1199
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:40,420
He's two murders away
from completing his masterpiece.

1200
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:43,923
We'll wait for his plea.

1201
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:51,639
My client says there are two more bodies.
Two more victims hidden away.

1202
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:54,600
He will take Detectives Mills
and Somerset to these bodies...

1203
01:36:54,767 --> 01:36:58,938
...but only Detective Mills and Somerset,
only at 6:00 today.

1204
01:36:59,105 --> 01:37:00,690
Why us?

1205
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:02,317
He says he admires you.

1206
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:05,403
It's part of the game.

1207
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:08,323
The client claims
if the detectives do not accept this...

1208
01:37:08,489 --> 01:37:12,410
- ...these bodies will never be found.
- Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot.

1209
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:13,828
Hey.

1210
01:37:13,995 --> 01:37:15,246
We've got him.

1211
01:37:15,413 --> 01:37:17,623
Downstairs, locked up. Done deal.

1212
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:20,835
He's gonna get his free room and board,
get his free cable TV.

1213
01:37:21,002 --> 01:37:24,464
Hell, my wife doesn't even have cable.
Why are we having this conversation?

1214
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:27,091
- Mills.
- No. Hey, something stinks.

1215
01:37:27,258 --> 01:37:28,426
And this one here--

1216
01:37:28,593 --> 01:37:32,263
Yeah, you, in your $3000 suit
and that smug smile on your face...

1217
01:37:32,430 --> 01:37:35,016
- ...dealing for that shit, I don't like it--
- Mills.

1218
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:37,435
I am required by law to serve my clients...

1219
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:39,354
- ...to the best of my ability.
- Aw, Jesus.

1220
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:42,982
- To serve their best interest.
- We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.

1221
01:37:43,149 --> 01:37:45,568
My client wishes inform you
if you do not accept...

1222
01:37:45,735 --> 01:37:48,363
...he will plead insanity across the board.

1223
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:50,198
Let him try it.

1224
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:51,491
I'd like to see him try.

1225
01:37:51,657 --> 01:37:54,660
Come on, now, we all know
the extreme nature of these crimes...

1226
01:37:54,827 --> 01:37:57,246
...I could get him <i>off</i> with such a plea.

1227
01:37:57,413 --> 01:38:00,124
I'm not letting this conviction slide.
I can tell you that.

1228
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:03,920
He says that if you do accept
under his specific conditions...

1229
01:38:04,087 --> 01:38:06,714
...he'll sign a full confession,
plead guilty right now.

1230
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:09,300
It's your case. Make a decision.

1231
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:12,720
Full confession.

1232
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:15,681
- I'm in.
- It has to be the both of you.

1233
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:22,605
If he were to claim insanity,
this conversation is admissible.

1234
01:38:22,772 --> 01:38:25,024
The fact that he's blackmailing us
with his plea.

1235
01:38:25,191 --> 01:38:27,819
And my client would like to remind you
two more are dead.

1236
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:29,487
Press would have a field day...

1237
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:32,615
...if they find out the police didn't seem
concerned about them.

1238
01:38:32,782 --> 01:38:35,993
- Giving them a proper burial.
- If in fact there are two more dead.

1239
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:40,331
Lab report came up from downtown. They
did a quickie on Doe's clothing and nails.

1240
01:38:40,498 --> 01:38:44,001
They found blood from Doe.
From him slicing his fingers.

1241
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:46,796
Blood from the woman
who's face he cut off.

1242
01:38:46,963 --> 01:38:51,676
And blood from a third party,
as yet unidentified.

1243
01:38:54,887 --> 01:38:56,973
You'd be escorting an unarmed man.

1244
01:39:00,017 --> 01:39:01,477
Let's finish it.

1245
01:39:05,106 --> 01:39:08,109
If John Doe's head splits open
and a UFO should fly out...

1246
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:11,028
...I want you to have expected it.

1247
01:39:12,697 --> 01:39:14,365
I will.

1248
01:39:16,659 --> 01:39:18,911
Hey, man, if I was
to accidentally shave off a nipple...

1249
01:39:19,078 --> 01:39:20,705
...would it be covered
by workman's comp?

1250
01:39:20,872 --> 01:39:21,873
Hmm.

1251
01:39:26,085 --> 01:39:28,171
I suppose so.

1252
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,381
- Yeah.
- If you were man enough...

1253
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:34,760
...to actually file a claim,
I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.

1254
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,973
If I keep coming home late,
my wife's gonna think something's up.

1255
01:39:48,065 --> 01:39:49,567
You know...

1256
01:39:50,735 --> 01:39:52,028
Yeah.

1257
01:39:57,867 --> 01:39:59,160
What?

1258
01:41:10,773 --> 01:41:11,983
Let's go.

1259
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:44,849
<i>C-Victor-5-5 take. Clear the TC.</i>

1260
01:41:45,016 --> 01:41:46,267
Pull around.

1261
01:41:47,685 --> 01:41:50,771
<i>There it is.
Late-model black sedan at your 10 o'clock.</i>

1262
01:42:00,031 --> 01:42:01,198
Who are you, John?

1263
01:42:02,283 --> 01:42:04,076
Who are you really?

1264
01:42:04,368 --> 01:42:05,453
What do you mean?

1265
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:09,373
At this stage, what harm can it do
to tell us a bit about yourself?

1266
01:42:09,874 --> 01:42:13,044
It doesn't matter who I am.
Who I am means absolutely nothing.

1267
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:15,129
You need to stay on your left up here.

1268
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:21,093
So where are we heading?

1269
01:42:21,761 --> 01:42:22,803
You'll see.

1270
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:27,058
We're not just going to pick up
two more dead bodies, are we, John?

1271
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:29,435
That wouldn't be shocking enough.

1272
01:42:29,602 --> 01:42:32,730
We've got newspapers
to think about, yeah?

1273
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:36,025
Wanting people to listen...

1274
01:42:36,192 --> 01:42:39,737
...you can't just tap them
on the shoulder anymore.

1275
01:42:39,904 --> 01:42:42,281
You have to hit them
with a sledgehammer.

1276
01:42:42,448 --> 01:42:45,409
And then you'll notice
you've got their strict attention.

1277
01:42:45,576 --> 01:42:47,453
But the question is:

1278
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:50,289
What makes you so special
that people should listen?

1279
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:51,957
I'm not special.

1280
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:55,586
<i>I've never been exceptional.</i>

1281
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:59,590
<i>This is, though, what I'm doing.
My work.</i>

1282
01:43:00,049 --> 01:43:01,342
Your work, John?

1283
01:43:01,926 --> 01:43:03,052
Yes.

1284
01:43:03,219 --> 01:43:06,180
See, I don't--
I don't see anything special about it, John.

1285
01:43:07,598 --> 01:43:08,641
That's not true.

1286
01:43:08,808 --> 01:43:09,892
No, it is true.

1287
01:43:10,059 --> 01:43:13,229
And the funny thing is, all this work...

1288
01:43:13,396 --> 01:43:15,398
...two months from now,
no one's gonna care.

1289
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:17,900
No one's gonna give a shit,
no one's gonna remember.

1290
01:43:18,067 --> 01:43:21,112
You can't see the whole complete
act yet.

1291
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:23,447
But when this is done...

1292
01:43:24,782 --> 01:43:26,117
...when it's finished...

1293
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:29,453
...it's going to be...

1294
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:35,793
People will barely be able
to comprehend.

1295
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:38,003
But they won't be able to deny.

1296
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:41,090
Could the freak be more vague?

1297
01:43:42,258 --> 01:43:44,510
I mean, as far as master plans go, John--

1298
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:48,514
I can't wait for you to see. I really can't.
It's really going to be something.

1299
01:43:49,598 --> 01:43:52,309
Well, you know what?
I'm gonna be standing next to you.

1300
01:43:52,476 --> 01:43:55,730
So when this big thing happens,
you be sure and let me know.

1301
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:59,400
- Because I wouldn't wanna miss it.
- Oh, don't worry.

1302
01:43:59,567 --> 01:44:00,609
You won't.

1303
01:44:02,611 --> 01:44:04,739
You won't miss a thing.

1304
01:44:11,328 --> 01:44:14,623
<i>With the tour bus itself,
give two miles separation.</i>

1305
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:32,725
What's so exciting?

1306
01:44:33,934 --> 01:44:35,853
It's not too far now.

1307
01:44:39,565 --> 01:44:41,317
<i>High-tension lines ahead.</i>

1308
01:44:41,484 --> 01:44:42,651
<i>Prepare for frequency change.</i>

1309
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:45,571
I've been trying to figure something
in my head.

1310
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:48,115
And maybe you can help me out, yeah?

1311
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:53,704
When a person is insane,
as you clearly are...

1312
01:44:53,871 --> 01:44:56,207
...do you know that you're insane?

1313
01:44:56,373 --> 01:44:58,793
Maybe you're sitting around,
reading <i>Guns and Ammo...</i>

1314
01:44:58,959 --> 01:45:02,213
...masturbating in your own feces,
do you just stop and go:

1315
01:45:02,379 --> 01:45:05,883
"Wow, it is amazing how fucking crazy
I really am"?

1316
01:45:06,217 --> 01:45:08,552
Yeah? Do you guys do that?

1317
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:12,056
It's more comfortable
for you to label me insane.

1318
01:45:12,223 --> 01:45:13,432
It's very comfortable.

1319
01:45:14,225 --> 01:45:17,561
It's not something I would expect
you to accept.

1320
01:45:17,937 --> 01:45:20,731
But I did not choose. I was chosen.

1321
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:24,777
- Well, whatever.
- I don't doubt that you believe that, John.

1322
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:29,406
But seems to me that you're overlooking
a glaring contradiction.

1323
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:30,825
Meaning what?

1324
01:45:32,034 --> 01:45:33,953
Glad you asked.

1325
01:45:35,287 --> 01:45:36,914
If you were chosen...

1326
01:45:37,081 --> 01:45:40,918
...that is, by a higher power...

1327
01:45:41,669 --> 01:45:43,504
...and if your hand was forced...

1328
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:47,174
...it seems strange to me
that you'd get such enjoyment out of it.

1329
01:45:47,842 --> 01:45:50,719
You enjoyed torturing those people.

1330
01:45:51,428 --> 01:45:54,932
This doesn't seem in keeping
with martyrdom, does it?

1331
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:57,309
John?

1332
01:46:02,147 --> 01:46:05,025
I doubt I enjoyed it
any more than Detective Mills...

1333
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:08,904
...would enjoy time alone with me
in a room without windows.

1334
01:46:09,488 --> 01:46:11,282
Isn't that true?

1335
01:46:11,615 --> 01:46:14,535
How happy would it make you
to hurt me with impunity.

1336
01:46:14,702 --> 01:46:15,786
That hurts my feelings.

1337
01:46:17,371 --> 01:46:20,541
- I would never--
- You wouldn't because there's consequences.

1338
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:24,670
It's in those eyes of yours, though.

1339
01:46:24,837 --> 01:46:27,506
Nothing wrong with a man
taking pleasure in his work.

1340
01:46:28,257 --> 01:46:33,178
I won't deny my own personal desire
to turn each sin against the sinner.

1341
01:46:34,179 --> 01:46:37,433
Wait a minute, I thought all you did
was kill innocent people.

1342
01:46:39,435 --> 01:46:42,021
Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny?

1343
01:46:42,897 --> 01:46:44,356
An obese man.

1344
01:46:44,523 --> 01:46:47,026
A disgusting man
who could barely stand up.

1345
01:46:47,192 --> 01:46:51,488
If you saw him, you'd point him out to your
friends so they'd join you in mocking him.

1346
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:53,949
A man, who if you saw him
while you were eating...

1347
01:46:54,116 --> 01:46:56,660
...you wouldn't be able
to finish your meal.

1348
01:46:56,952 --> 01:47:00,497
And after him, lawyer. You must've
secretly been thanking me for that one.

1349
01:47:00,998 --> 01:47:03,918
This is a man who dedicated his life...

1350
01:47:04,084 --> 01:47:08,714
...to making money by lying
with every breath that he could muster...

1351
01:47:08,881 --> 01:47:11,759
...to keeping murderers and rapists
on the streets.

1352
01:47:11,926 --> 01:47:13,344
- Murderers?
- A woman.

1353
01:47:13,510 --> 01:47:15,596
- Murderers, John, like yourself?
- A woman...

1354
01:47:15,763 --> 01:47:18,474
...so ugly inside that she
couldn't bear to go on living...

1355
01:47:18,641 --> 01:47:20,935
...if she couldn't be beautiful
on the outside?

1356
01:47:21,101 --> 01:47:25,522
A drug dealer.
A drug dealing pederast, actually.

1357
01:47:25,689 --> 01:47:28,359
And let's not forget
the disease-spreading whore.

1358
01:47:30,611 --> 01:47:33,030
Only in a world this shitty...

1359
01:47:33,197 --> 01:47:36,909
...could you try to say these were
innocent people and keep a straight face.

1360
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:41,997
But that's the point.

1361
01:47:43,165 --> 01:47:46,210
We see a deadly sin
on every street corner...

1362
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:49,254
...in every home and we tolerate it.

1363
01:47:49,922 --> 01:47:52,675
We tolerate it
because it's common, it's...

1364
01:47:52,841 --> 01:47:54,510
It's trivial.

1365
01:47:54,677 --> 01:47:57,638
We tolerate it morning, noon and night.

1366
01:48:00,724 --> 01:48:02,893
Well, not anymore.

1367
01:48:04,895 --> 01:48:07,272
I'm setting the example.

1368
01:48:08,273 --> 01:48:09,984
And what I've done is gonna be...

1369
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:11,902
...puzzled over...

1370
01:48:12,069 --> 01:48:13,904
...and studied...

1371
01:48:14,697 --> 01:48:16,407
...and followed...

1372
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:18,951
...forever.

1373
01:48:19,743 --> 01:48:21,537
Yeah.

1374
01:48:22,413 --> 01:48:24,748
Delusions of grandeur.

1375
01:48:25,624 --> 01:48:27,418
You should be thanking me.

1376
01:48:27,918 --> 01:48:29,128
Why's that, John?

1377
01:48:29,294 --> 01:48:32,423
Because you're going
to be remembered after this.

1378
01:48:32,589 --> 01:48:36,427
Realize, detective, the only reason
that I'm here right now...

1379
01:48:36,593 --> 01:48:38,637
...is that I wanted to be.

1380
01:48:38,804 --> 01:48:41,306
No. No, we would've got you eventually.

1381
01:48:41,473 --> 01:48:42,766
Oh, really?

1382
01:48:42,933 --> 01:48:47,187
So, what were you doing, biding your time?
Toying with me?

1383
01:48:47,771 --> 01:48:53,193
Allowing five innocent people to die
until you felt like springing your trap?

1384
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:57,448
Tell me, what was the indisputable evidence
you were going to use on me...

1385
01:48:57,614 --> 01:49:02,077
...right before I walked up to you
and put my hands in the air?

1386
01:49:02,244 --> 01:49:04,455
John, calm down.

1387
01:49:04,621 --> 01:49:06,999
I seem to remember us
knocking on your door.

1388
01:49:07,332 --> 01:49:09,168
Oh, that's right.

1389
01:49:09,334 --> 01:49:12,671
And I seem to remember
breaking your face.

1390
01:49:17,426 --> 01:49:20,262
You're only alive because I didn't kill you.

1391
01:49:20,429 --> 01:49:22,389
- Okay, sit back.
- I spared you.

1392
01:49:22,556 --> 01:49:23,599
Sit back.

1393
01:49:23,766 --> 01:49:26,060
Remember that every time
you look in the mirror...

1394
01:49:26,226 --> 01:49:28,937
...at that face of yours
for the rest of your life...

1395
01:49:29,104 --> 01:49:30,773
...or should I say for the rest...

1396
01:49:30,939 --> 01:49:33,317
- ...of what life I allow you to have.
- Sit back.

1397
01:49:33,484 --> 01:49:37,071
Sit back, you fucking freak.
Shut your fucking mouth.

1398
01:49:38,697 --> 01:49:41,450
You're no messiah.
You're a movie of the week.

1399
01:49:41,617 --> 01:49:45,204
You're a fucking T-shirt at best.

1400
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:00,552
Don't ask me to pity those people.

1401
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:02,137
I don't mourn them any more...

1402
01:50:02,304 --> 01:50:04,848
...than the thousands that died
at Sodom and Gomorrah.

1403
01:50:05,182 --> 01:50:09,645
Is that to say, John, that what you
were doing was God's good work?

1404
01:50:12,898 --> 01:50:16,193
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

1405
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:20,239
Do you see those high-tension towers?

1406
01:50:20,697 --> 01:50:23,033
<i>- That's where we're headed.</i>
<i>- I see where.</i>

1407
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:25,536
<i>Right to your 9 o'clock
and follow that access road.</i>

1408
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:34,044
<i>Your signal's breaking up, Viking.</i>

1409
01:50:34,211 --> 01:50:37,673
<i>Un-fucking-avoidable, Center.
We're in power-line city, deal with it.</i>

1410
01:50:39,174 --> 01:50:42,010
This sure as shit is no ambush out here.

1411
01:50:42,177 --> 01:50:44,930
- No fucking nothing out here.
- Can't land anywhere near.

1412
01:50:45,097 --> 01:50:47,933
They're gonna be coming up
behind us in about two minutes.

1413
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:50,352
I want you to go up, way up.

1414
01:50:50,519 --> 01:50:53,647
Thirty seconds, bank east on my mark.
Thirty seconds.

1415
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:57,461
I'm getting him out.

1416
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:01,632
<i>Target is now fully into standby.</i>

1417
01:52:02,466 --> 01:52:03,467
<i>Got you in sight.</i>

1418
01:52:03,634 --> 01:52:05,052
<i>Get out.</i>

1419
01:52:05,594 --> 01:52:07,429
Slowly.

1420
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:09,223
Stop.

1421
01:52:09,765 --> 01:52:11,308
Stay.

1422
01:52:14,061 --> 01:52:15,771
What do you got?

1423
01:52:16,897 --> 01:52:18,649
Dead dog.

1424
01:52:19,942 --> 01:52:21,485
I didn't do that.

1425
01:52:25,155 --> 01:52:27,324
<i>We're holding on standby, copy?</i>

1426
01:52:28,325 --> 01:52:29,409
What time is it?

1427
01:52:30,327 --> 01:52:32,913
- Why?
- I'd like to know.

1428
01:52:36,291 --> 01:52:37,376
Seven-oh-one.

1429
01:52:40,671 --> 01:52:41,755
It's close.

1430
01:52:42,839 --> 01:52:44,007
Let's go take a look.

1431
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:48,804
It's this way.

1432
01:52:51,848 --> 01:52:53,892
<i>Bird 2, close your distance.</i>

1433
01:52:54,059 --> 01:52:56,603
<i>This is Bird 2. They're away from the car.</i>

1434
01:52:56,770 --> 01:52:58,939
<i>Coming in closer.</i>

1435
01:53:00,816 --> 01:53:04,194
<i>We got them. We got them. Closing in.</i>

1436
01:53:04,361 --> 01:53:05,988
<i>Negative. Negative. Hold your go.</i>

1437
01:53:31,972 --> 01:53:33,056
Mills?

1438
01:53:37,311 --> 01:53:40,355
Down, down, down.

1439
01:53:41,356 --> 01:53:42,858
Watch him.

1440
01:53:44,109 --> 01:53:45,944
There he goes.

1441
01:53:46,153 --> 01:53:48,322
<i>It's good we have some time to talk.</i>

1442
01:53:52,409 --> 01:53:53,827
<i>Van approaching.</i>

1443
01:53:53,994 --> 01:53:57,414
Stay on the guy in red. Do not take
the crosshairs off the guy in red.

1444
01:54:02,044 --> 01:54:04,671
<i>He's going out
to meet the van. Just stay down.</i>

1445
01:54:05,130 --> 01:54:08,300
There's a van coming down the road.
From the north.

1446
01:54:17,476 --> 01:54:20,062
Be ready for anything, now.
Wait for my signal.

1447
01:54:20,228 --> 01:54:21,855
Wait for me.

1448
01:54:27,277 --> 01:54:29,321
Get out of the van!

1449
01:54:30,739 --> 01:54:31,782
<i>Out!</i>

1450
01:54:31,948 --> 01:54:34,117
Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot me.

1451
01:54:34,284 --> 01:54:35,952
Step away.

1452
01:54:36,411 --> 01:54:38,622
Turn around.
Put your hands on your head.

1453
01:54:38,789 --> 01:54:40,957
What the hell is going on?

1454
01:54:41,124 --> 01:54:43,919
<i>- What are you doing here?</i>
- I'm delivering a package.

1455
01:54:44,086 --> 01:54:45,796
I got this package for this guy, David.

1456
01:54:45,962 --> 01:54:49,257
Uh, Detective David Mills.

1457
01:54:56,223 --> 01:54:58,558
Get it. Slowly.

1458
01:54:59,434 --> 01:55:01,978
<i>Stay alert. He's opening the back of the van.</i>

1459
01:55:02,145 --> 01:55:03,814
<i>We've got him in sight.</i>

1460
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:13,323
This guy paid me 500 bucks
to bring it out here, man.

1461
01:55:13,490 --> 01:55:15,575
He said he wanted it here at exactly 7:00.

1462
01:55:16,326 --> 01:55:17,828
Put it down.

1463
01:55:18,453 --> 01:55:19,788
<i>We got a box.</i>

1464
01:55:19,955 --> 01:55:24,251
We got a box. Call the bomb squad.
I need a bomb squad. We got a box.

1465
01:55:24,709 --> 01:55:26,420
Face the van.

1466
01:55:26,795 --> 01:55:28,255
Hands up.

1467
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:37,305
Turn around.

1468
01:55:38,181 --> 01:55:40,100
Okay. Go. Off you go. Go.

1469
01:55:40,267 --> 01:55:42,394
<i>Do you want us to pick this guy up?</i>

1470
01:55:43,311 --> 01:55:45,313
I'm sending the driver out on foot.

1471
01:55:48,191 --> 01:55:52,154
<i>- Got the driver in sight.</i>
- He's headed north. Have him picked up.

1472
01:56:01,413 --> 01:56:03,331
Oh, I don't know.

1473
01:56:09,546 --> 01:56:11,047
I'm gonna open it.

1474
01:56:11,214 --> 01:56:15,093
When I said I admired you,
I meant what I said.

1475
01:56:33,737 --> 01:56:34,821
It's blood.

1476
01:56:34,988 --> 01:56:36,740
You've made quite a life for yourself.

1477
01:56:36,907 --> 01:56:37,949
Hmm.

1478
01:56:38,116 --> 01:56:41,244
- You should be very proud.
- Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.

1479
01:56:54,925 --> 01:56:56,343
<i>Someone lost contact, copy.</i>

1480
01:57:08,939 --> 01:57:10,398
California, stay away from here.

1481
01:57:10,565 --> 01:57:13,026
Stay away from here, now.
Don't come in here.

1482
01:57:13,485 --> 01:57:15,195
<i>Whatever you hear, stay away.</i>

1483
01:57:16,404 --> 01:57:19,491
John Doe has the upper hand. Mills!

1484
01:57:19,908 --> 01:57:21,034
Here he comes.

1485
01:57:21,201 --> 01:57:23,078
- Throw your gun down!
- What?

1486
01:57:23,245 --> 01:57:25,455
- I wish I could've lived like you.
- Shut up.

1487
01:57:25,622 --> 01:57:28,416
- What the fuck you talking about?
- Go away!

1488
01:57:28,583 --> 01:57:29,876
Do you hear me, detective?

1489
01:57:30,043 --> 01:57:34,381
I'm trying to tell you how much
I admire you and your pretty wife.

1490
01:57:35,465 --> 01:57:37,300
- What?
- Tracy.

1491
01:57:37,467 --> 01:57:38,677
Mills!

1492
01:57:38,843 --> 01:57:39,928
What'd you fucking say?

1493
01:57:40,095 --> 01:57:44,182
It's disturbing how easily a member
of the press can purchase information...

1494
01:57:44,349 --> 01:57:46,059
...from the men in your precinct.

1495
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:48,061
What the fuck?

1496
01:57:48,478 --> 01:57:50,355
<i>Throw your gun down!</i>

1497
01:57:50,522 --> 01:57:52,566
I visited your home this morning...

1498
01:57:53,567 --> 01:57:55,360
After you'd left.

1499
01:57:55,527 --> 01:57:57,654
- Mills!
- I tried to play husband.

1500
01:57:58,321 --> 01:58:01,575
I tried to taste the life of a simple man.

1501
01:58:01,783 --> 01:58:03,034
Throw it away!

1502
01:58:03,201 --> 01:58:05,495
Tsk, it didn't work out.

1503
01:58:05,662 --> 01:58:07,330
So...

1504
01:58:07,497 --> 01:58:09,416
I took a souvenir.

1505
01:58:11,042 --> 01:58:12,752
Her pretty head.

1506
01:58:12,919 --> 01:58:14,504
Mills.

1507
01:58:15,046 --> 01:58:16,673
Mills.

1508
01:58:17,674 --> 01:58:18,842
What's he talking about?

1509
01:58:19,009 --> 01:58:21,386
- Give me your gun.
- What's going on over there?

1510
01:58:21,553 --> 01:58:22,846
Put the, ugh-- Put the gun down.

1511
01:58:23,013 --> 01:58:25,015
I saw you with a box.
What was in the box?

1512
01:58:25,181 --> 01:58:28,101
- Because I envy your normal life.
- Put the gun down, David.

1513
01:58:28,268 --> 01:58:31,229
- It seems that envy is my sin.
- Oh, what's in the box?

1514
01:58:31,396 --> 01:58:33,732
- Not until you give me the gun.
- What's in the box?

1515
01:58:33,898 --> 01:58:35,650
- Give me the gun.
- He just told you.

1516
01:58:35,817 --> 01:58:39,446
- You lie. You're a fucking liar, shut up.
- David.

1517
01:58:39,613 --> 01:58:42,365
That's what he wants.
He wants you to shoot him.

1518
01:58:42,532 --> 01:58:45,660
No! No.

1519
01:58:46,036 --> 01:58:47,829
You tell me that's not true.

1520
01:58:47,996 --> 01:58:50,123
- That's not true.
- Become vengeance, David.

1521
01:58:50,290 --> 01:58:53,168
- Oh, she's all right. You tell me.
- Become...

1522
01:58:53,335 --> 01:58:55,837
- ...wrath.
- Tell me she's all right!

1523
01:58:56,004 --> 01:58:58,131
- If you murder a suspect, David--
- No.

1524
01:58:58,298 --> 01:59:00,050
You throw it all away, he knows it.

1525
01:59:00,216 --> 01:59:01,217
No!

1526
01:59:01,384 --> 01:59:03,386
- She begged for her life.
- Shut up.

1527
01:59:03,553 --> 01:59:07,223
She begged for her life
and for the life of the baby inside of her.

1528
01:59:23,281 --> 01:59:24,658
Oh.

1529
01:59:26,576 --> 01:59:27,786
He didn't know.

1530
01:59:41,758 --> 01:59:43,718
Give me the gun, David.

1531
01:59:48,682 --> 01:59:50,183
David.

1532
01:59:51,476 --> 01:59:52,894
If you kill him...

1533
01:59:54,396 --> 01:59:56,147
...he will win.

1534
01:59:59,859 --> 02:00:01,695
Oh, God.

1535
02:00:01,861 --> 02:00:04,072
Oh, God.

1536
02:00:04,781 --> 02:00:05,949
Oh!

1537
02:00:19,379 --> 02:00:21,131
Oh, fuck, he shot him.

1538
02:00:43,236 --> 02:00:45,822
<i>Set it down somewhere.</i>

1539
02:00:47,031 --> 02:00:49,325
<i>Come on, set us down.</i>

1540
02:00:51,745 --> 02:00:55,540
<i>Holy Christ. Somebody call somebody.</i>

1541
02:00:55,707 --> 02:00:57,542
<i>Call somebody.</i>

1542
02:01:12,015 --> 02:01:15,059
Well, we'll take care of him.

1543
02:01:23,735 --> 02:01:25,779
Whatever he needs.

1544
02:01:26,696 --> 02:01:28,198
Where are you gonna be?

1545
02:01:30,909 --> 02:01:32,285
Around.

1546
02:01:36,623 --> 02:01:38,541
I'll be around.

1547
02:01:42,420 --> 02:01:44,672
<i>Ernest Hemingway once wrote:</i>

1548
02:01:44,839 --> 02:01:49,260
<i>"The world is a fine place
and worth fighting for."</i>

1549
02:01:50,094 --> 02:01:52,680
<i>I agree with the second part.</i>
