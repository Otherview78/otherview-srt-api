1
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,390
Broke in right on the two of them.

2
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,680
No matter what they say, it's all about money.

3
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,100
So let's imagine, ladies, that you're a Savings and Loan officer. Watch.

4
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,070
One, two, three. See?

5
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,280
You've got it all, and we've got nothin'.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,320
- And you have all four. Take a look. - Oh!

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,320
But I wouldn't trust you with real gold.

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,950
- That's why this one's only worth about a penny. - Hmm.

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,660
And if you wonder where the other one went, watch.

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,040
A penny from the ear. How much for the rest?

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,540
- Have you seen Edward? - No, I haven't. Great party, Philip.

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,130
My wife went to a lot of trouble; she called a caterer.

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,340
- Excuse me, Ann. Howard, how are you? - Philip, good.

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,420
Hey, I understand Edward's taking over Morse Industries.

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,670
- Yeah, well, he's not here to get a suntan. - Can I get in on it?

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,680
- Yeah. Call me. - When?

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,680
Just call me.

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,600
- Uh, hi. I'm Philip Stuckey, Edward Lewis's lawyer. - Where's the guest of honor?

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,310
He's probably off in a corner somewhere charming a very pretty lady.

20
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,190
How are you?

21
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:08,810
I told my secretary to make the arrangements. Didn't she call you?

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,820
Yes, she did. I speak to your secretary more than I speak to you.

23
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,700
- I see. - I have my own life too, you know, Edward.

24
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,700
This is a very important week for me. I need you here.

25
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,040
But you never give me any notice. You just think I'm at your beck and call.

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,170
I do not believe that you are at my beck and call.

27
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,210
Well, that's the way you always make me feel.

28
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,960
- Maybe I should just move out. - If that's what you want, yes.

29
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,010
All right, when you get back to New York, we'll discuss it.

30
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,590
- Now is as good a time as any. - That's fine with me, Edward. Good-bye.

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,590
Good-bye, Jessica.

32
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,140
- Phil suggested that maybe I should take a-- - Phil is just my lawyer, okay?

33
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,110
- Yes, sir. - How did the Morse stock open at the Nikkei?

34
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,570
- I don't know. - You don't know? Tokyo opened maybe 90 minutes ago.

35
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,570
- You have to keep on top of these things, all right? - Done.

36
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,610
- Hello, Mr. Lewis. - Hi. How you doin'? I want this whole thing...

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,070
wrapped up as soon as possible; I gotta get to New York by Sunday.

38
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,030
- I got tickets to the Met. - Yes, sir.

39
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,410
- Your coat, Mr. Lewis. - Thank you.

40
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,080
- Edward! - Susan!

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,080
- Hi. - Hi.

42
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,000
- I was sorry to hear about Carter. - Oh, yeah. Thanks.

43
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,420
- Heard you got married. - Well... yeah. I couldn't wait for you!

44
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,180
Mmm. Susan, tell me something.

45
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,720
- Yes? - When you and I were dating,

46
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,930
did you speak to my secretary more than you spoke to me?

47
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,600
She was one of my bridesmaids.

48
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,070
Hmm. Your husband's a very lucky guy.

49
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,480
- Bye. - Thanks, bye.

50
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,490
- Do you? - Absolutely.

51
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,780
- Wonderful. - He's leaving. Edward's leaving.

52
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,830
- Excuse me. - Sure.

53
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,000
Is this Mr. Stuckey's car?

54
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,040
Edward, where you goin'?

55
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,170
- You got the keys to your car? - Why, what's wrong with the limo?

56
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,920
Look, the limo is buried back there. Darryl can't get it out.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,960
- Mmm. - Please give me the keys. - All right, look.

58
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,420
I don't think you should drive. You're a little excited. Don't drive my car.

59
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,090
Let me work something out here. Fellas, what kind of a system is this?

60
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,260
Can you move these cars out of here? Look, Edward.

61
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,310
- Edward. Uh, are you familiar with a stick shift? - Uh, yeah.

62
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,310
- Have you driven a shift? Listen, all right. - Yeah. Yeah.

63
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,640
Just be ginger with it. It's a new car.

64
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,650
- Don't, uh- Just don't- - Okay. I can do it.

65
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,650
Edward! Give me a break, please!

66
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,610
- I love this car. - I love it too. Look, you don't even know where you're going.

67
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,780
You're gonna get lost in the dark!

104
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,810
Everybody comes to Hollywood got a dream.

105
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,110
What's your dream? What's your dream?

106
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,490
Hey, mister? Hey, what's your dream?

107
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,490
Have a good one.

108
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,750
- What happened? - Some chick. She bought it over there.

109
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,660
Detective Albertson. What do you know about that girl?

110
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,920
I tell you, man. I don't know who she hang with.

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,090
C'mon, guy. We just pulled her out of a Dumpster in the back. Who was her pimp?

112
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,340
Cocaine her pimp. She a strawberry.

113
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,180
She be out on these streets day in, day out, tradin' her sorry self for some crack.

114
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,680
- And what do you do? - I cool.

115
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,850
Oh, I'll bet. Hey, hey, hey! Excuse me! Excuse me!

116
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,600
- What are you, from the press? - No, no. We're from Orlando.

117
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,810
Oh, I don't believe this. Do you- I got tourists photographing the body, Al.

118
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,610
What happened?

119
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,620
In a world that can be so insane

120
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,290
I don't think it's very strange for me to be in love with you

121
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,760
I wanna know more than your brain

122
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,760
Hey, Pops, has Kit been in here?

123
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,890
Upstairs in the poolroom.

124
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:58,140
Now I smile for your affection We have made a soul connection

125
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,180
Just for whom does your bell toll

126
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,150
Don't be cruel Show me your soul

127
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,150
Yo, Viv!

128
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,230
- Is it all gone? - Carlos, you know my roommate, Vivian.

129
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,860
- This is Angel. That's the Dude. - I know everybody! Is it all gone, Kit?

130
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,240
Carlos sold me some great shit. We just had this party. I was the hostess.

131
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,700
I can't believe you bought drugs with our rent. What is goin' on with you, Kit?

132
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,250
I needed a little pick-me-up.

133
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,330
- Well, we need rent money! - Oh, calm down, chica.

134
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,380
- She only owes me 200 more. - Carlos!

135
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,750
- Another $200? - That was from way before.

136
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,340
That's right, 200, Vivian. But if you wanna work off her money with me,

137
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,510
- we can work something out. - That's a very sweet offer, Carlos, but not now.

138
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,560
- Come on, Viv. Come downstairs. - Work out- Work out what?

139
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,020
- What are we gonna work out? - You really like her, Carlos?

140
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,060
You took it while I was sleeping?

141
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,480
- You were unavailable for consultation. - Hey, let's go.

142
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,610
Snack! Snack!

143
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,280
- Besides, it's my apartment. - Yeah, well, I have to live there too, Kit.

144
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Look, you came here; I gave you some money; I gave you a place to stay...

145
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,700
and some valuable vocational advice.

146
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,700
He was on my case. I had to give him something.

147
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,870
So don't irritate me.

148
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,210
- This ain't a buffet, Kit. - Irritate you?

149
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,210
Irritate you? I just saw a girl pulled out of a Dumpster.

150
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,550
I know. Skinny Marie. But... she was a- a flake.

151
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,720
She was a crack head. Dominic was trying to straighten her out for months.

152
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,390
Leave her alone!

153
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,430
Don't you want to get outta here?

154
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,560
Get outta where? Where the fuck you wanna go?

155
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,070
Aah, nothin' but garbage.

156
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,820
- Uh, excuse me. - Huh?

157
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,820
- Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills? - You're here!

158
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,070
That's Sylvester Stallone's house right there.

159
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,990
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

160
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,080
- Hey, yo, Rachel. - What?

161
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,630
- Yeah. You see the stars on the sidewalk, babe? - Yeah.

162
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:52,050
Well, Vivian and me, we work Bob Hope, we work the Ritz Brothers,

163
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,470
we work Fred Astaire, we work all the way down to Ella Fitzgerald.

164
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,970
This is our turf. We got seniority. You better get off our corner.

165
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,310
Forgive me. I was just takin' a rest here. Besides, she's new.

166
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,640
Yeah. Well, I'm old, so go rest up by Monty Hall or Esther Wilson.

167
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,850
- Williams. - Esther Williams! Where you belong!

168
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,530
Back off, Kit. You know, you're really becoming a grouch.

169
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,820
- Am I really a grouch? - Yes.

170
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,820
Sometimes.

171
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,160
Well, just 'cause I'm hungry. I'm gonna go get something to eat.

172
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,540
- Hey, girls. - Hey, yo, baby!

173
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,620
How about a freebie? It's my birthday.

174
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,670
Dream on!

175
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,960
It's lookin' really slow tonight.

176
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:38,720
Yeah, well... maybe we should get a pimp, you know. Carlos really digs you.

177
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,850
And then he'll run our lives and take our money. No.

178
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,470
You're right. We say who, we say when, we say how much.

179
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,860
- Do you think I look like Carol Channing? - No! I love this look.

180
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,650
It's very glamorous. Glamour choice.

181
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,650
Oh, yo, oh, yo. Catch this!

182
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,410
Wait a minute. That's a Lotus Esprit.

183
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,330
No, that's rent. You should go for him. You look hot tonight.

184
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,040
Don't take less than a hundred. Call me when you're through. Take care of you.

185
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,170
Take care of you.

186
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,680
Work it. Work it, baby. Work it!

187
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,350
Work it. Own it.

188
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,510
Yes, you can handle this.

189
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,680
First is here somewhere.

190
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,520
Hey, sugar, you lookin' for a date?

191
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,190
No, I wanna find Beverly Hills. Can you give me directions?

192
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,860
Sure. For five bucks.

193
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,530
- Ridiculous. - Price just went up to ten.

194
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,570
You can't charge me for directions.

195
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,290
I can do anything I want to, baby. I ain't lost.

196
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,250
All right, okay?

197
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,590
All right. You win, I lose. Got change for a 20?

198
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,380
For 20, I'll show you personal. Even show you where the stars live.

199
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,890
- Oh, that's all right. I already been to Stallone's. - Right. Uh, down the street.

200
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,440
Lights! Lights would be good here.

201
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,590
It's a little, a little temperamental.

202
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,980
Yours? No,it isn't

203
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,730
Stolen?

204
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,940
Not Exactly

205
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,860
What's your name?

206
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,160
What do you want it to be?

207
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,710
- Vivian. My name is Vivian. - Vivian.

208
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,670
- So, what hotel you stayin' at? - The, uh, Regent Beverly Wilshire.

209
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,300
Down the block, right at the corner.

210
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,350
Man, this baby must corner like it's on rails!

211
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,350
I beg your pardon?

212
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,350
Well, doesn't it blow your mind? This is only four cylinders.

213
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,770
- You know about cars. Where did that come from?

214
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,480
Road and Track. The boys back home I grew up with,

215
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,490
they were really into American heavy metal: Mustangs, Corvettes.

216
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,320
- Ah. - They bought 'em cheap and fixed 'em up. I paid attention.

217
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,990
So how is it you know so little about cars?

218
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,160
My first car was a limousine.

219
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,620
- Oh. - So where is this...

220
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,670
heavy metal... home?

221
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,500
Millage Ville, Georgia.

222
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,670
You know, I think you left your transmission back there.

223
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,340
- You're not shifting right. This is a standard "H."

224
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,850
Standard "H." Like I know what that means.

225
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,180
Have you ever driven a Lotus?

226
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,850
- No. - You're gonna start right now.

227
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:41,150
- You're joking. - No. It's the only way I can get you off my coat.

228
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,530
Fasten your seat belts. I am taking you for the ride of your life.

229
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,700
- I'm gonna show you what this car can really do. Are you ready? - I am ready.

230
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,370
- Hang on. - Okay. - Here we go.

231
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,420
This has pedals like a race car. They're really close together.

232
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,380
So it's probably easier for a woman to drive, 'cause they have little feet.

233
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,390
Except me. I wear a size nine.

234
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,060
You know your foot's as big as your arm from your elbow to your wrist?

235
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,060
Did you know that?

236
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,730
- No, I didn't know that. - It's a little bit of trivia.

237
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:26,700
Tell me, what kind of- what kind of money you girls make these days?

238
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,700
Ballpark.

239
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,530
Can't take less than $100.

240
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,040
- A hundred dollars a night. - For an hour.

241
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,080
An hour?

242
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,750
You make $100 an hour and you got a safety pin holding your boot up?

243
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,750
You gotta be joking.

244
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,880
- I never joke about money. - Neither do I.

245
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,880
Hundred dollars an hour.

246
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,800
Pretty stiff.

247
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:59,190
Well, no. But it's got potential.

248
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Good evening, Mr. Lewis.

249
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,370
Will you be needing the car anymore tonight?

250
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,920
I- I hope not!

251
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,920
Ah. We're here.

252
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,840
Yeah.

253
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,310
So you'll be all right?

254
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,060
Yeah, I'm gonna grab a cab with my twenty bucks.

255
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:44,480
- Go back to your office. - Yeah.

256
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,030
My office. Yeah.

257
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:51,030
Well, thanks for the ride.

258
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,950
- See you. - Good-bye.

259
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,170
No taxis?

260
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,890
No, I like the bus.

261
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:20,020
I was thinking- Did you really say $100 an hour?

262
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,940
- Yeah. - Yeah.

263
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,440
Well, if you don't have any prior engagements,

264
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,070
I'd be very pleased if you would accompany me into the hotel.

265
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,030
You got it.

266
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,490
What is your name?

267
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,160
- Edward. - Edward. That's my favorite name in the whole world!

268
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,120
- No! - I tell you what, this is fate, Edward.

269
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,710
That's what this is.

270
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:51,590
- Why don't you put this on? - Why?

271
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:56,590
Well, this hotel is not the kind of establishment that rents rooms by the hour.

272
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,560
Ah.

273
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:08,060
- Wow! - It's all right.

274
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,490
- Holy shit. - You're gonna be fine.

275
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,030
Come with me. And stop fidgeting.

276
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,990
- Good evening, Mr. Lewis. - Hello. You have messages?

277
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,210
- Yes, we have several. - Thank you.

278
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,880
- Could you send up some champagne and strawberries, please? - Of course.

279
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,220
Room service for Mr. Lewis, please.

280
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,600
Oh, honey.

281
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:52,480
You know what's happened? I've got a runner in my pantyhose.

282
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,320
I'm not wearing pantyhose.

283
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,040
Well, color me happy! There's a sofa in here for two.

284
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,040
- First time in an elevator. - Ah.

285
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,500
Close your mouth, dear.

286
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,970
Sorry, I couldn't help it.

287
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,890
Try.

288
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,770
- Penthouse. - The penthouse.

289
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,310
- Yes. - Mmm.

290
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,270
- To the left. - Oh.

291
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,840
Oh, I miss keys.

292
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,850
Impressed?

293
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,350
You kidding me? I come here all the time.

294
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,780
- As a matter of fact, they do rent this room by the hour. - Sure they do.

295
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,610
Wow, great view!

296
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:23,830
- I bet you can see all the way to the ocean from out here. - I'll take your word for it.

297
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,160
- I don't go out there. - Why don't you go out there?

298
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,670
- I'm afraid of heights. - You are?

299
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,920
So how come you rented the penthouse?

300
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,880
It's the best. I looked all around for penthouses on the first floor,

301
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,840
but I can't find one.

302
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,560
Well, now that you have me here, what are you going to do with me?

303
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,230
- Want to know something? I don't have a clue. - No?

304
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,560
I hadn't exactly planned this.

305
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,360
Well, do you plan everything?

306
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,230
- Always. - Yeah. Me too.

307
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,700
I'm actually- No, I'm not a planner. I wouldn't say I was a planner.

308
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,740
I would say I was, um, a kind of "fly by the seat of my pants" gal.

309
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,870
You know, moment to moment. That's me. That's- Yeah.

310
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,500
Mm-hmm. You know, you could pay me.

311
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,590
That's one way to maybe break the ice.

312
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:22,340
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Uh, I assume cash is acceptable.

313
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,600
Cash works for me, yeah.

314
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,520
You're on my fax.

315
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:40,070
Well, that's one I haven't been on before.

316
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,450
Cute. She's very cute. Thank you.

317
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,950
All right. Here we go.

318
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,740
Pick one. I got red, I got green, I got yellow.

319
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,960
I'm out of purple, but I do have one gold circle coin left.

320
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,130
The condom of champions. The one and only. Nothing is gettin' through this sucker.

321
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,960
- What d'you say? Hmm? - A buffet of safety.

322
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,380
I'm a safety girl.

323
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,600
- All right, let's get one of these on you.

324
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,470
No. I-

325
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,980
Why don't we just talk for a little bit, okay?

326
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:20,570
Talk. Yeah... uh... okay.

327
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,740
Edward, are you in town on, uh, business or pleasure?

328
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,950
- Business, I think. - Business, you think.

329
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:33,750
Well... let me guess.

330
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,000
That would make you... a lawyer.

331
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,960
- A lawyer. - Mm-hmm.

332
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,590
- What makes you think I'm a lawyer? - You've got that, um...

333
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,260
sharp, useless look about you.

334
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,850
I bet you've known a lot of lawyers.

335
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,520
I've known a lot of everybody.

336
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,440
What is that?

337
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,780
- Champagne. - Oh! Well.

338
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,280
Might as well make myself useful.

339
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,990
Take a load off.

340
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:17,920
- Good evening. - Hi.

341
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,460
- Uh, where would you like it? - Where would we like it?

342
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,510
Uh, over by the bar.

343
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,060
Excuse me!

344
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,060
It'll be on your bill, Mr. Lewis.

345
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,980
Thank you.

346
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,730
What are you lookin' at?

347
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:48,110
- What is he lookin' at? - Ah, yes. Here you go. Thank you very much.

348
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,120
Thank you very much, sir. Have a nice night.

349
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,120
A tip. Wow. I missed that one. Oh.

350
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,160
- Stupid. - Don't worry about it.

351
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,290
- You mind if I take my boots off? - Not at all.

352
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:03,590
- So, do you have a wife? Girlfriend? - I have both.

353
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,470
Where are they? Shopping together?

354
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:13,220
My ex-wife... is now in Long Island... in my ex-home...

355
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,850
with my ex-dog.

356
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:23,520
There you go. My ex-girlfriend, Jessica, is in New York...

357
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,400
moving out of my apartment even as we speak.

358
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,290
Why don't you try a strawberry?

359
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:40,620
- Why? - It brings out the flavor in the champagne.

360
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,540
Oh, groovy.

361
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,220
Pretty good.

362
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:58,730
- Don't you drink? - No.

363
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:05,110
Listen, I- I appreciate this whole seduction scene you've got goin',

364
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,860
but let me give you a tip: I'm a sure thing, okay?

365
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,860
So, I'm on an hourly rate. Could we just move it along?

366
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,070
Somehow I'm sensing that this time problem is a major issue with you.

367
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,080
Why don't we just get through that right now?

368
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,700
- Great, let's get started. - How much for the entire night?

369
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,880
Stay here?

370
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,290
You couldn't afford it.

371
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,260
- Try me. - $300.

372
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:35,350
Done. Thank you. Now we can relax.

373
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,070
I'll be out in just a minute. That champagne kind of got to me.

374
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,070
- I didn't hear you. What did you say? - Uh...

375
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,950
I said I'd be out in just a minute.

376
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,240
What is- What do you have in, uh, your hand there?

377
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,580
- What are you hiding? - Nothing.

378
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:03,250
All right, look. I do not want any drugs here.

379
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,130
I don't want any of this. Get your things and your money and please leave.

380
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,340
I don't do drugs, all right? I- I stopped doing drugs when I was 14.

381
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,510
What is this? What is this?

382
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:17,100
- This is dental floss. - Yeah? So?

383
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:23,140
I had all those strawberry seeds. And you shouldn't neglect your gums.

384
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,350
I'm sorry. Please continue.

385
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,270
Thank you.

386
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,240
- Are you gonna watch? - No, I'm going.

387
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:44,500
Thank you.

388
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,420
It's just that, uh, very few people surprise me.

389
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:53,090
Yeah, well, you're lucky. Most of 'em shock the hell outta me.

390
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:00,430
- You're watching. - I'm going.

391
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,820
Yes, that may be true, Vance.

392
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:21,080
Yes, I know, but I still need the numbers on Morse Industries.

393
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,750
Uh-huh. I've got 'em from London;

394
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,910
I need 'em now from Tokyo.

395
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,580
I'll call down and get them when I want them. Thank you very much.

396
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:35,170
I have a little carpet picnic here. Are you sure you don't want a drink?

397
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:39,010
I'm high on life. Can't you tell?

398
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,650
You know, I never saw this episode.

399
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,540
What do you want?

400
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,670
What do you do?

401
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,340
Everything.

402
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,390
But I don't kiss on the mouth.

403
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,010
Neither do I.

404
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,160
- Hey, how you doing there? - All right.

405
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,540
- Good morning, gentlemen. - Good morning, Mr. Thompson.

406
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,080
- Good morning, good morning. - Good morning, sir.

407
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,080
- Good morning, Mr. Thompson. - Good morning, Marjorie.

408
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,540
Of course Morse is going to fight. It's to be expected.

409
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,630
He's run his company for a very long time now.

410
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,470
I don't think he's ready to have his name taken off the stationery.

411
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,800
He wants to meet you face to face.

412
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,600
- I wouldn't do it. - Sure, you wouldn't. But do it anyhow.

413
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,600
Tonight. Dinner. Set it up.

414
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,520
Oh, Edward, Edward. I- Look, it's really not a good idea that you see him.

415
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,810
Definitely not alone. You know? He's a feisty old guy.

416
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:19,520
You know, we say the wrong thing, we could wind up in court.

417
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,980
Well, you know, there's always a possibility things are gonna go wrong.

418
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:27,200
That's why I enjoy this so much. Oh, by the way, Phil, about your car.

419
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,950
- Oh, God. What? - It corners like it's on rails.

420
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:35,620
What? What does that mean? Edward? Edward!

421
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,670
Hi.

422
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,170
Well, good morning.

423
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,170
Red.

424
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:46,050
Better.

425
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,300
Y- You didn't wake me. I can see you're really busy.

426
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,720
- I'm gonna be outta here in just a minute. - No, there's no hurry.

427
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,730
Are you hungry? You must be.

428
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:59,810
Why don't you sit and have something to eat?

429
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,400
I, uh, took the liberty of ordering everything on the menu.

430
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,900
I didn't know what you'd like.

431
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,160
- Thanks. - All right? Good.

432
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,830
- Did you sleep well? - Yeah, too good.

433
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:20,330
- I forgot where I was. - Occupational hazard?

434
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,420
Yeah. Did you sleep?

435
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:28,800
Uh, yes, a little, on the couch.

436
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,840
I was, uh, working last night.

437
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,300
You don't sleep, you don't do drugs,

438
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:36,850
you don't drink, you hardly eat.

439
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,730
What do you do, Edward? 'Cause I know you're not a lawyer.

440
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,310
That's right.

441
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,530
There are four other chairs here.

442
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,530
Oh.

443
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,700
- So what do you do? - I buy companies.

444
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,040
What kind of companies?

445
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,880
Uh, I buy companies that are in financial difficulty.

446
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,380
If they have problems, you must get 'em for a bargain, huh?

447
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,210
Well, the company I'm buying this week,

448
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,970
I'm getting for the bargain price of about one billion.

449
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,970
- A billion dollars? - Yes.

450
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,640
Wow. You must be really smart, huh?

451
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,230
I only got through the eleventh grade.

452
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:27,070
How far did you go in school?

453
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,700
I went all the way.

454
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:36,530
Your folks must be really proud, huh?

455
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:47,090
So you don't actually have a billion dollars, huh?

456
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,840
No, I get some of it from banks, investors.

457
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,340
It's not an easy thing to do.

458
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,140
- And you don't make anything and you don't build anything. - No. No.

459
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,020
- So what do you do with the companies once you buy them? - I sell them.

460
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,060
Here, let me do that. You sell them.

461
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,650
Well, I... don't sell the whole company; I break it up into pieces...

462
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,150
and then I sell that off; it's worth more than the whole.

463
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:14,610
So it's sort of like, um, stealing cars and selling 'em for the parts, right?

464
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,450
- Yeah, sort of. But legal. - Mm-hmm.

465
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:20,790
There. See, now it's perfect.

466
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,750
Not bad. Not bad at all. Where'd you learn to do that?

467
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:28,960
Well, I screwed the debate team in high school.

468
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,300
I had a grandpa! He was nice to me. He liked ties on Sundays.

469
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,140
Mind if I, um, take a swim in your tub before I go?

470
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,560
Not at all. Just stay in the shallow end.

471
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:45,560
- Hello? - Edward, it's Phil. Listen, I'm running out the door.

472
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,810
I just wanted to let you know, Morse is all set for tonight.

473
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,820
- Oh, that's good. - He's bringing his grandson.

474
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,070
He's grooming him to take over. I don't know.

475
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,870
Ah, yes. Very intense young man named David. He plays polo.

476
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,290
Look, I gotta say this again. I don't like you goin' alone.

477
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:03,370
I just want your extra time and your

478
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:07,040
Look, I just think it'd be better if you- if you went with a date.

479
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,380
You know? Keep it social.

480
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,880
- Edward? Did you hear me? - Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm here.

481
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,470
- If you want to impress me - What is that?

482
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,470
- Oh - Housekeeping is singing.

483
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,600
Got to be too flirty, Mama

484
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,850
- I know how to undress me - Yeah... listen.

485
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:28,360
- Edward, I know a lot of nice girls. - No, you don't.

486
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,320
I just want your extra time and your

487
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,940
Kiss

488
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:39,700
- Besides, I already have one. - If you want to impress me

489
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:44,250
You just concentrate on finding out what Morse is up to. I'm on my way.

490
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:49,210
I know how to undress me Mm-hmm, yeah, baby

491
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:53,300
I want to be your fantasy

492
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,420
Well, maybe you could be mine

493
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:59,140
Mm-hmm You just leave it

494
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,720
All up to me

495
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,230
Don't you just love Prince?

496
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,480
- More than life itself. - Don't you knock?

497
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,900
Vivian, I have a business proposition for you.

498
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,740
- What do you want? - I'm gonna be in town until Sunday.

499
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:18,820
I'd like you to spend the week with me.

500
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,580
- Really? - Yes.

501
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,080
Yes, I'd like to hire you as an employee.

502
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,920
- Would you consider spending the week with me?

503
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,840
I will pay you to be at my beck and call.

504
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,300
Look, I'd love to be your "beck and call girl,"

505
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,130
but you're a rich, good-lookin' guy.

506
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,550
You could get a million girls free.

507
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,930
I want a professional.

508
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:48,350
I don't need any romantic hassles this week.

509
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,860
If you're talkin' 24 hours a day, it's gonna cost you.

510
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,030
Oh, yes, of course!

511
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,570
All right, here we go.

512
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,780
Give me a ballpark figure. How much?

513
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:04,490
Six full nights, days too.

514
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:08,960
- Four thousand. - Six nights at 300 is 1,800.

515
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,460
- You want days too. - Two thousand.

516
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,630
- Three thousand. - Done.

517
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:19,420
Holy shit!

518
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,930
Vivian.

519
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,220
Vivian, is that a yes?

520
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:31,350
Yes. Yes!

521
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:34,770
I'll be gone most of the day. I want you to buy some clothes.

522
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:37,860
- You really should think about traveler's checks. - We may be going out evenings.

523
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,700
- You'll need something to wear. - Like what?

524
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,030
Uh, nothing too flashy. Not too sexy.

525
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:47,490
- Conservative. You understand? - Boring.

526
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,330
Elegant. Any questions?

527
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:53,500
- Can I call you Eddie? - Not if you expect me to answer.

528
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,840
I would've stayed for 2,000.

529
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,590
I would've paid four.

530
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,680
- I'll see you tonight. - Baby, I'm gonna treat you so nice,

531
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,510
you're never gonna wanna let me go.

532
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:11,980
Three thousand for six days. And, Vivian, I will let you go.

533
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:18,690
But I'm here now.

534
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:33,920
Three thousand dollars!

535
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,550
Ooh.

536
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,590
Hello?

537
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,140
I called and called. Where were you last night?

538
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,220
- Ma? - It's Viv.

539
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,890
Oh. Hi. I had to party. Where are you?

540
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,480
Oh, man. Are you ready for this? The guy?

541
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,070
The Lotus? I am in his hotel room in Beverly Hills.

542
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,570
The penthouse. His bathroom is bigger than the Blue Banana!

543
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,780
Do I have to hear this?

544
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,990
Kit, he wants me to stay the whole week. And you know what he's gonna give me?

545
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,040
Guess. You'll never guess.

546
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,910
- Three thousand dollars. - Bullshit!

547
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,500
I swear to God. And extra money to buy clothes.

548
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,210
Oh, man! I am bummed. I gave that guy to you!

549
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,800
Three thousand. Really? Is he twisted?

550
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,510
- No. - Ugly? - He's good-looking!

551
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,680
- Well, what's wrong with him? - Nothing.

552
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,350
- Did he give you the money yet? - At the end of the week. - That's what's wrong with him.

553
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,220
Well, he gave me 300 for last night. And, Kit?

554
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:36,190
I'm gonna leave some at the front desk for you. I want you to pick it up.

555
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:40,230
I'm at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. Write it down.

556
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,490
Are you writing it down? You'll forget it. Write it down.

557
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:47,320
Reg... Bev... Wil.

558
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,030
Now, one more thing. Where do I go for the clothes? Good stuff, on him.

559
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,040
- In Beverly Hills? - Yeah.

560
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,460
Rodeo Drive, baby.

561
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,050
- Hi. - Yes, ma'am. May I help you?

562
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,920
Yeah, I'm leaving this here for Kit De Luca. She's gonna pick it up.

563
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,010
- Don't open that. - No, ma'am.

564
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,640
- Grazie. - Arrivederci.

565
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,400
Miss Wilson, do you know that lady?

566
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,560
No, sir.

583
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,970
Are you looking for something in particular?

584
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,690
No. Well, yeah. Something... conservative.

585
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,650
Yes.

586
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,490
- You got nice stuff. - Thank you.

587
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:52,820
- How much is this? - I don't think this would fit you.

588
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:57,080
Well, I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.

589
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,080
How much is this, Marie?

590
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,460
It's very expensive.

591
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,790
- It's very expensive. - Look, I got money to spend in here.

592
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,670
I don't think we have anything for you.

593
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,670
You're obviously in the wrong place.

594
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,970
Please leave.

595
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,950
Doctor's office? Two blocks down and to your left.

596
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,870
Thank you.

597
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,580
Tiffany is taking the corner space; they like the project.

598
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,920
We're very excited about the whole thing.

599
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,300
Did you realize that Via Rodeo is the first new street...

600
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,010
in Beverly Hills in 75 years?

601
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:56,510
- Excuse me, miss, may I help you? - I'm going to my room.

602
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:00,100
- Uh, do you have a key? - Oh. I forgot that cardboard thing.

603
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,770
- I'm on the top floor. - You're a guest here?

604
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,900
- I'm with a friend. - And who would that be?

605
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,230
- Edward. - Edward?

606
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,820
Edward... Edward, uh-

607
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,070
- He knows me. - Dennis.

608
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:19,030
Dennis, did you just come off the night shift? Hmm?

609
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,620
- Yes, sir. - Do you know this young lady?

610
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,250
- She's with Mr. Lewis. - Mr. Lewis.

611
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,130
That's it. Edward Lewis! Thanks, Dennis.

612
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:30,880
- Evidently she joined him last night. - Thank you.

613
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,510
Oh, God! What now? What? What?

614
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,840
- What is with everybody today? - No, no. It's all right. Just come with me.

615
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,100
- We'll have a little chat. Thank you. Dennis, thank you. - I'm coming.

616
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,390
- Uh, what is your name, miss? - What do you want it to be?

617
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:45,640
- Don't play with me, young lady. - Vivian.

618
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,940
Thank you. Vivian.

619
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,110
Well, Miss Vivian.

620
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:55,610
Things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.

621
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:58,490
Now, Mr. Lewis, however, is a very special customer,

622
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:01,620
and we like to think of our special customers as friends.

623
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:06,460
Now, as a customer, we would expect Mr. Lewis to sign in any additional guests,

624
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,790
but as a friend, we're willing to overlook it.

625
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:12,880
Now, I'm assuming that you're a-

626
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,970
- Relative? - Yes.

627
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:20,800
I thought so. Then you must be his-

628
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:23,310
Niece?

629
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:29,850
Of course. Naturally, when Mr. Lewis leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.

630
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:33,980
I assume you have no other uncles here.

631
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,450
Good! Then we understand each other. I would also encourage you...

632
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:40,410
to dress a little more appropriately; that'll be all.

633
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,160
No, that's not all. That's what I was trying to do. I tried to go...

634
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,120
get a dress on Rodeo Drive today, and the women wouldn't help me.

635
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,290
And I have all this money now and no dress!

636
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:51,080
Not that I expect you to help me, but I have all of this, okay?

637
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:53,460
I have to buy a dress for dinner tonight.

638
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,130
And nobody will help me.

639
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,600
Oh, man, if you're callin' the cops.

640
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,440
Yeah, call the cops. That's great. Tell 'em I said hi.

641
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,690
Women's clothing.

642
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:19,780
Bridget, please.

643
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:33,500
Yes, Bridget. Hello. This is Barnard Thompson here at the Regent Beverly Wil-

644
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:38,300
Thank you, yes, but I'd like you to do a favor for me, please.

645
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,720
I'm sending someone over. Her name is Vivian.

646
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,890
She's a special guest.

647
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:47,680
She's the niece of a very special guest.

648
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,600
Now, this is the jewel in Morse's crown:

649
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,610
prime industrial property straddling the port of Long Beach and Los Angeles.

650
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:57,440
The real estate possibilities are endless, but most of the yard we'll just level.

651
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,280
We just got the information, Mr. Stuckey.

652
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,200
Edward, we just got the Morse update. Don, can you hold the projection, please?

653
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,990
Yeah, what? Speak.

654
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:12,250
Old Man Morse just got the inside track on a $350 million contract...

655
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,330
to build destroyers for the Navy.

656
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,340
Navy contract. I can't believe this.

657
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,340
- You said they had nothing in the hopper on this one! - I thought they didn't.

658
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,340
Hey, you know, if that's true it could cost a lot more.

659
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,340
Those stocks could go through the roof.

660
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:28,640
- Yeah, no shit, Sherlock. - Maybe we're lucky to get this information now, sir.

661
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,270
- See, we can still walk away from it. - Walk away?

662
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,310
Hey, forget it, pal. We got a thousand man-hours in on this!

663
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,810
- Nobody's walkin' away from anything! - Philip, I think he's right.

664
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,270
Gentlemen, relax!

665
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,610
Relax! Who do we know on the Senate Appropriations Committee?

666
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,780
Senator Adams.

667
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,830
All right, Senator Adams. Let's find out where he is.

668
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:51,710
The Navy's not gonna spend $350 million on anything without going to Appropriations first.

669
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:54,000
- I don't understand what's goin' on here today, gentlemen. - Hello?

670
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,790
That's why I hired you, Phil, to do my worrying for me.

671
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,880
I'll be in your office. Bob, if you want to send over the geologicals?

672
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,880
- No problem. - Thank you. - Edward.

673
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,640
- Listen, everything all set for the meeting tonight? - Mm-hmm.

674
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,930
Who- Who is this girl you're going with?

675
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:10,930
Nobody you know.

676
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:13,810
Yes, Edward Lewis Enterprises. Phil Stuckey.

677
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:15,810
Yes, I have him right here.

678
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:19,440
- Don't worry, Mrs. Rainey, I'll call you the minute it comes in. - Thank you.

679
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,780
- Have a nice day. - Thank you.

680
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,780
Hello. You must be Vivian. My name's Bridget.

681
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,580
Yeah, hi. Barney said you'd be nice to me.

682
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:37,000
He's very sweet. What are your plans while you're in town?

683
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,130
- We're gonna have dinner. - Oh, don't sit on there, dear!

684
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,920
- You're gonna go out? Dinner? - Mm-hmm.

685
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,010
Well, you'll need a cocktail dress then. Come with me.

686
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,180
Now, I'm sure we're gonna find something here that your uncle will love.

687
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,810
- You're a size six, right? - Yeah. How'd you know that?

688
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:55,230
- Oh, that's my job. - Bridg, he's not really my uncle.

689
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:57,600
They never are, dear.

690
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,900
Barney! Sorry, mister.

691
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:05,150
I got a dress!

692
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:07,160
Well, I'd rather hoped you'd be wearing it.

693
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,490
Oh, no, I didn't want to get it messed up! Listen, I got shoes too. You wanna see?

694
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:12,200
No, that won't be necessary. I'm sure they're quite lovely. Thank you.

695
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,410
Okay, well, listen. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but Bridget was really great...

696
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:16,410
and I just wanted to say thanks.

697
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,130
- You're cool. - You're welcome, Miss Vivian.

698
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,260
Hello?

699
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,470
Never, ever pick up the phone.

700
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:32,810
- Then why are you calling me? - Did you buy clothes today?

701
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:35,350
- I got a dress. A cocktail one. - That's good.

702
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,600
I'll be in the hotel lobby, 7:45 sharp.

703
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,600
What? You're not comin' up to the door?

704
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,610
This isn't a date. It's business.

705
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:43,730
Where are you takin' me, anyway?

706
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:45,900
I'm taking you to a restaurant called the Voltaire.

707
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,360
- Very elegant. - All right.

708
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,490
I'll meet you in the lobby, but only 'cause you're payin' me to.

709
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:54,790
Well, thank you very much.

710
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,000
Get her back for me, please.

711
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,920
- Mr. Stuckey wanted to see you. - Yes, tell him I'm in the middle of a very important phone call.

712
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,340
Hello?

713
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:11,050
- I told you not to pick up the phone. - Then stop callin' me.

714
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:16,640
Sick.

715
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:20,900
- Barney! - It didn't fit.

716
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:24,900
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Uh- I've got a little problem.

717
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,900
All right, Miss Vivian, one more time.

718
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:31,200
- Dinner napkin. - Dinner napkin, laid gently in the lap.

719
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,660
Good. Elbows off the table. Don't slouch.

720
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:38,040
Shrimp fork,

721
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,000
salad fork, dinner fork.

722
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I definitely have the salad fork.

723
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,840
The rest of the silverware is a little confusing.

724
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,340
All right, if you get nervous, just count the tines.

725
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,680
Four tines: dinner fork.

726
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:56,850
And sometimes there are three tines in the salad fork. And sometimes-

727
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,360
Pardon me, Mr. Lewis. I'm Mr. Thompson. I'm the manager of the hotel.

728
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:14,700
- Uh-huh. Excuse me, I just want to make one call. - Yes, um, sir.

729
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,330
- I have a message for you, sir. - From who?

730
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:20,540
- From your niece, sir. - My what?

731
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:23,120
The young lady who's staying with you in your room, sir.

732
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:26,880
Oh. Hmm.

733
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,050
- I think we both know that she's not my niece. - Of course.

734
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,590
The reason I know that is that I am an only child.

735
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:35,720
- Yes, sir. - What's the message?

736
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,720
She's waiting for you in the lounge.

737
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:42,190
Intriguing young lady, Miss Vivian.

738
00:49:42,190 --> 00:49:46,110
- Intriguing. - Have a good evening, sir.

739
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:51,950
- Thank you, Mr. -? - Thompson. I'm the manager- manager of the hotel, sir.

740
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,360
You're late.

741
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,440
You're stunning.

742
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:35,780
You're forgiven.

743
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:39,870
Shall we go to dinner?

744
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:56,010
- This way, Mr. Lewis. Your party is waiting. - Stop fidgeting.

745
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:02,100
- Mr. Morse. - Yes, Mr. Lewis. I'm Jim Morse.

746
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:06,730
This fireball is my grandson, David.

747
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,270
Well, I don't know about the fireball part, but grandson is true enough.

748
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:12,230
I'm pleased to meet you both. This is a friend of mine, Vivian Ward.

749
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:16,320
- Hi. I'm really glad to meet you. - Mr. Morse. David.

750
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,240
Please, sit.

751
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,410
Excuse me.

752
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:31,920
- Where are you going? - I'm going to the ladies' room.

753
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:36,970
- Upstairs, to the right. - Okay. Excuse me.

754
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:41,180
- Shall I order for you? - Yeah.

755
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,180
Please do so. Thank you.

756
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:46,140
I'll do that.

757
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,030
Mr. Lewis, my grandfather believes the men who create a company...

758
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:58,820
- should control its destiny. - Where's the salad?

759
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,410
Uh, the salad comes at the end of the meal.

760
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,870
That's the fork I knew.

761
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,710
Let me, uh, put it another way.

762
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:12,090
Between your public statements and the rumors flying around on this thing,

763
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:14,960
we find it very hard to figure out what your real intentions are.

764
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,880
I don't know about you, but I've never been able to figure which goes with what!

765
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,990
You know, there was a time when we built ships the size of cities.

766
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:41,280
- Men like my grandfather made this country. - Who ordered this?

767
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,530
The gentleman did, ma'am. Bon appetite.

768
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:47,330
These are escargot. It's French for snails. It's a delicacy.

769
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,330
Try it. David?

770
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:54,710
Mr. Lewis, if you were to get control- and I don't think you will- but if you did,

771
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:57,670
what do you plan to do with the company?

772
00:52:57,670 --> 00:52:59,800
Break it up and sell off the pieces.

773
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,840
I'm sure you'll understand I'm not thrilled at the idea...

774
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:07,520
of your turning 40 years of my work into your garage sale.

775
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,730
At the price I'm paying for this stock, Mr. Morse, you are going to be a very rich man.

776
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:16,070
I'm rich enough. I just want to head my shipyard.

777
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:21,490
Slippery little suckers.

778
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:26,330
It happens all the time.

779
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,910
I met your father. What's his name?

780
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:34,710
- Carter. - Yeah. Carter. Carter Lewis.

781
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:37,300
He's not quite the bastard everybody says he is.

782
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:40,720
- No, I have the franchise on that. - Does that make him proud?

783
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,550
I doubt it. It doesn't really matter now. He passed away.

784
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:48,220
Oh, I hadn't heard. I'm sorry.

785
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:50,230
I'm sorry too.

786
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:54,060
Mr. Morse, you asked for this meeting. What can I do for you?

787
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:59,070
- Leave my company alone. - I can't do that. I own ten million shares.

788
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:02,070
- I'll buy your stock back. - You don't have the money.

789
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:04,740
We will; we're getting a contract to build ten destroyers.

790
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:08,200
There will be no contract. The contract is now buried in Appropriations Committee.

791
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,750
- And it will remain there. - And how the hell did you pull something like that?

792
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,790
You got dirty politicians in your pockets now or something?

793
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:16,290
Easy, easy, calm down. Calm down, David.

794
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:20,510
- Mr. Lewis plays hardball. - Yes, yes, I do.

795
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:24,130
I've heard enough of this. Vivian, it was a great pleasure to meet you.

796
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:28,720
I'm sorry, Grandfather. I've gotta get some air. Mr. Lewis.

797
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,770
I'd better join my grandson. You two enjoy your dinner.

798
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:36,060
I'm sure it'll be delicious. Good luck, miss.

799
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:40,400
Watch out, Lewis. I'm gonna tear you apart.

800
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,860
I look forward to it, sir.

801
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:54,920
Edward?

802
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:59,810
Edward, you said you never come out here.

803
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:03,560
Well, I'm only halfway out.

804
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:07,400
Didn't say much in the car on the way home.

805
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,030
You thinkin' about dinner? I was a maniac.

806
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:14,650
I mean, the business was good, I think. You know?

807
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:18,240
He's in trouble. You want his company.

808
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:20,240
He doesn't want to let it go.

809
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:22,540
Thanks for the recap.

810
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:26,420
The problem is, I think you liked Mr. Morse.

811
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,710
I'd like for you to get down from there; you're making me very nervous.

812
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:33,170
It's making you nervous? What if I just leaned back a little bit like this?

813
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,220
Would you- Would you rescue me if I fell?

814
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,260
Vivian, I'm serious. Come- I'm not looking.

815
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:41,260
It's really high. Look, no hands, no hands! Okay, all right. I'm sorry.

816
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:49,150
The truth is, it really is totally irrelevant whether I like this man or not.

817
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:52,610
I will not let myself become emotionally involved in business.

818
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:57,410
I know. Kit's always saying to me,

819
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:59,570
"Don't get emotional when you turn tricks."

820
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:02,490
That's why no kissing. It's too personal.

821
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:05,500
It's like what you're saying: You stay numb, you don't get involved.

822
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,830
When I'm with a guy, I'm like a robot. I just do it.

823
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:17,260
I mean... except with you.

824
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,840
Oh, of course, not with me.

825
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:25,140
You and I are such similar creatures, Vivian.

826
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:27,480
We both screw people for money.

827
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,650
I was sorry to hear about your dad.

828
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:39,320
- When did he die? - Last month.

829
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,120
Do you miss him?

830
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:48,460
I hadn't spoken to him in fourteen and a half years.

831
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:53,340
I wasn't there when he died.

832
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:56,210
- Do you want to talk about this? - No.

833
00:56:56,300 --> 00:57:00,680
Well, I tell you what, 'cause I got an idea.

834
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:06,020
Let's watch old movies all night. We'll just veg out in front of the TV.

835
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:10,900
- "Veg out"? - Yeah. Be still like vegetables. Lay like broccoli.

836
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:18,490
Look, I'll tell you what. I'll be back. We'll do broccoli tomorrow.

837
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:23,870
- Where are you going? - I'm going downstairs for a while.

838
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:28,080
Did you say marriage license?

839
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,670
Now, don't change the subject, just give me the stamp.

840
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:35,710
Oh, I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter, Brian, whatever your name is.

841
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:37,710
Oh, I love you.

842
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:53,980
Hi, uh, I'm in the penthouse. The guy that was here,

843
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:57,690
Mr. Lewis, have you seen him down there anywhere?

844
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:39,280
Thank you. Thank you very much.

845
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,360
I didn't know you played.

846
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:44,360
I only play for strangers.

847
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:48,200
I was gettin' lonely upstairs all by myself.

848
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:57,590
Gentlemen, would you mind leaving us, please?

849
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:02,470
Thank you.

850
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:07,550
People always do what you tell them to do?

851
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:41,000
I guess so.

852
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:41,980
Wake up. Time to shop.

853
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:48,530
Now, if you have any trouble using this card, have them call the hotel.

854
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:51,240
All right?

855
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,370
More shopping.

856
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:55,580
Mm-hmm.

857
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:59,830
I'm surprised you didn't buy more than one dress yesterday.

858
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,630
- Wasn't as much fun as I thought it was gonna be. - Why not?

859
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:06,300
They were mean to me.

860
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:08,760
Mean to you?

861
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:13,010
People are looking at me.

862
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,720
They're not looking at you; they're looking at me.

863
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:18,230
The stores are not nice to people. I don't like it.

864
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:23,060
Stores are never nice to people; they're nice to credit cards.

865
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:27,030
Okay, stop fidgeting. Get rid of your gum.

866
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:31,700
I don't believe you did that.

867
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:37,620
- Yes. - I am Mr. Hollister, the manager. May I help you?

868
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,040
- Edward Lewis. - Ah, yes, sir.

869
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:43,670
- You see this young lady over here. - Yes.

870
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:48,170
- Do you have anything in this shop as beautiful as she is? - Oh, yes.

871
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:53,800
Oh, no! No, no, no, I'm saying we have many things as beautiful as she would want them to be.

872
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:56,680
That's the point I was getting at, and I think we can all agree with that.

873
01:01:56,770 --> 01:02:01,190
- That's why when you came in- - Excuse me. We're gonna need a few more people helping us.

874
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:05,690
I'll tell you why. We're going to be spending an obscene amount of money in here.

875
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:08,650
So we're going to need a lot more help sucking up to us.

876
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:11,150
That's what we really like. You understand that.

877
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,240
Sir, you're in the right store and the right city for that matter.

878
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,450
Anything you see here, we can do, by the way. Get ready to have some fun.

879
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:20,160
Mary Pat, Mary Kate, Mary Francis, Tovah, let's see it!

880
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,620
- Come on. Bring it out, girls. - Oh, this is absolutely divine.

881
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:24,540
- Excuse me, sir, uh, - Yeah?

882
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:28,510
exactly how obscene an amount of money were you talking about?

883
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:30,840
Just profane or really offensive?

884
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:35,140
- Really offensive. - I like him so much!

885
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:53,820
Mr. Lewis, sir. Mr. Lewis, how's it going so far? Pretty well, I think.

886
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:57,240
I think we need some major sucking up.

887
01:02:57,330 --> 01:03:01,200
Very well, sir. You're not only handsome, but a powerful man.

888
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:04,040
I could see the second you walked in here, you were someone to reckon with-

889
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,040
- Hollister. - Yes, sir.

890
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:08,130
Not me. Her.

891
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:10,260
I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.

892
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,260
How we doing, ladies?

893
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:14,260
Oh, Edward, Edward. Where the hell are you?

894
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:17,050
The word's all over the street. Morse is gonna raise your offer, pal.

895
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:20,600
He's countering? God, he is a tough old bird.

896
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,440
He knows the navy contracts are stalled. Where's he gonna get the money?

897
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,810
I don't know. He, uh- I think he's throwin' in with the employees.

898
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:28,230
He still needs someone to underwrite the paper.

899
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:31,190
- Find out who it is. - Yeah, okay. You got it.

900
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,320
You're on your own. I have to go back to work. You look great!

901
01:03:35,410 --> 01:03:38,240
- She has my card. - And we'll help her use it, sir.

- Hello. - Do you remember me?

919
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:46,890
- No, I'm sorry. - I was in here yesterday. You wouldn't wait on me.

920
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,650
- Oh. - You work on commission, right?

921
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:51,650
Uh, yes.

922
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:54,400
Big mistake. Big. Huge!

923
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,820
I have to go shopping now.

924
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:01,320

925

♪ Oh, oh, pretty woman ♪♪

930
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:25,100
- Mister Lewis. - Gentlemen.

931
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:27,310
Fellas, let's finish this up this afternoon, huh?

932
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:31,480
Jake, set something up with Blair. Around 2:00, 2:30 would be good.

933
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:35,980
You were right about Morse. He mortgaged everything he owns, right down to his underwear,

934
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:38,150
to secure a loan from the bank.

935
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,990
And it's not just any bank. Plymouth Trust, huh?

936
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:43,530
- Hmm. - So, it goes without saying...

937
01:05:43,620 --> 01:05:45,910
that your business means a lot more to them than our friend, Mr. Morse.

938
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:48,410
All you gotta do is call the bank.

939
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,840
Yeah.

940
01:05:57,710 --> 01:06:02,180
Edward, excuse me for saying this, but what the hell is wrong with you this week?

941
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:06,220
Are you givin' Morse a chance to get away?

942
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:10,770
You know what I used to love when I was a kid, Phil?

943
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:13,610
What?

944
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:15,610
Blocks.

945
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:19,400
Building blocks. Erector sets.

946
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,910
So, I liked Monopoly. Boardwalk, Park Place. Wh-What's the point?

947
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:28,160
We don't build anything, Phil. We don't make anything.

948
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,410
We make money, Edward.

949
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:33,920
We worked for a year on this deal. It's what you said you wanted.

950
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,040
I'm handing it to you.

951
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:40,090
Morse's jugular is exposed. It's time for the kill.

952
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:42,260
Let's finish this.

953
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:44,260
Call the bank!

954
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:07,410
How was your day, dear?

955
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,210
Nice tie.

956
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:15,250
I got it for you.

957
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:20,300
Well, my mother was a music teacher...

958
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:25,010
and married my father, whose family was extremely wealthy.

959
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:29,180
Then he divorced my mother to be with another woman.

960
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,600
And he took his money with him.

961
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,100
And then she died.

962
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:37,190
I was very angry with him.

963
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:40,230
It cost me $10,000 in therapy to say that sentence.

964
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,240
I was very angry with him.

965
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,820
I do it very well, don't I? I'll say it again. I was very angry with him.

966
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:48,530
Hello, my name is Mr. Lewis. I'm very angry with my father.

967
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:52,540
I would've been angry at the $10,000.

968
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:58,420
My father was president of the third company I ever took over.

969
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:03,670
I bought it. I sold it off piece by piece.

970
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:07,550
- What'd the shrink say? - He said I was cured.

971
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:11,060
Well, so you got even. That must've made you happy.

972
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:20,860
Did I mention my leg is 44 inches from hip to toe,

973
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:26,450
so, basically, we're talkin' about 88 inches of therapy...

974
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:29,950
wrapped around you for the bargain price of...

975
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:32,740
$3,000.

976
01:08:32,830 --> 01:08:35,410
Yeah.

977
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:40,130
Ebersol of the Falcons passes to Kennan.

978
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:42,710
This is Bill Fricker with Gwen Olsen giving you play-by-play...

979
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,010
- of this marvelous charity event. - Watch where you're walking.

980
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:48,430
If you step in something, we're not going back in the car.

981
01:08:48,510 --> 01:08:53,180
Not too near the tree. I don't like the ants. Hello. Have you seen Edward anywhere?

982
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:57,690
- What if someone recognizes me? - Not likely. They don't spend too much time on Hollywood Blvd.

983
01:08:57,730 --> 01:09:01,060
- You did. - Come on. Let go. Let go.

984
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:03,820
All right. You look great. You look like a lady.

985
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,860
You're gonna have a wonderful time.

986
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:11,120
Okay. Don't fidget and smile.

987
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,740
Humboldt's coming around to this side.

988
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:16,120
Toquenee is on Kennan. Penalty on that play.

989
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,460
This is Gwen and Gretchen, the infamous Olsen sisters,

990
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:22,090
who have made marrying well an art form.

991
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:24,340
- Edward. - Be back in just a second. Hold on.

992
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:27,170
So, you're the flavor of the month. Hmm.

993
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:31,390
Uh, she's just being testy. Edward's our most eligible bachelor.

994
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:33,390
Everybody is trying to land him.

995
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:38,390
Well, I'm not trying to land him. I'm just using him for sex.

996
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:41,400
Oh, yes.

997
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:45,030
- Well done. - Well done. Whoo, whoo, whoo!

998
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:49,700
Tell me again why we're here.

999
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:52,120
- Business. - Business mingling?

1000
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,530
Yeah.

1001
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:56,700
That's the chukker, ladies and gentlemen.

1002
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,710
Falcons, seven. Gems, four.

1003
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:02,960
- Excuse me. Edward! Edward. Over here. - Phil.

1004
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,960
- Ah, good to see you. - You too.

1005
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:06,960
I want you to meet a new friend of mine, Vivian Ward.

1006
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:09,970
Well, hi. Philip Stuckey, Vivian. This is my wife, Elizabeth.

1007
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:13,090
It's always a pleasure meeting one of Edward's girls.

1008
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:15,510
Oh, my God! It's Tate Whitley Wallington.

1009
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,770
Tate! It's me, Elizabeth, from Workout World.

1010
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:24,110
Sort of an aerobics queen. Feel the burns.

1011
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:27,230
Well, let me get you something to drink. Vivian, why don't you start with that. Okay?

1012
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,900
I'll be right back. Did you notice Senator Adams is here?

1013
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:31,950
Mm-hmm. I asked him.

1014
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:36,580
That is why I have pledged my eternal love to you. Mmm!

1015
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:40,210
Real genuine guy. Who is he?

1016
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:42,290
He's my lawyer. He's all right.

1017
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:44,290
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.

1018
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:46,290
Maybe we'll try that later.

1019
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:49,920
- Are these people your friends? - I spend time with them, yeah.

1020
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:53,720
- Well, no wonder. - No wonder what?

1021
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,760
No wonder why you came looking for me.

1022
01:10:56,810 --> 01:11:00,020
And I do need some help from you ladies and gentlemen in the audience.

1023
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:03,940
We need you to help replace some of the divots out here on the grass.

1024
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:06,820
- So come on out now. Come on! Come on, folks.

1025
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:09,280
You heard her. The stomping of the divots.

1026
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,990
This is a time-honored tradition, ladies and gentlemen.

1027
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:17,030
As old as the game of polo itself. Kings and queens used to do this.

1028
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:20,950
She's sweet, Edward.

1029
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,250
Wherever did you find her?

1030
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:26,040
976-BABE.

1031
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:33,590
Only one word of advice: Avoid the steaming divot!

1032
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:42,770
No, it's all part of the game of polo.

1033
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:45,230
You get to have your shoes polished by a member of the club.

1034
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:47,230
I think I got something in the car that will buff that up.

1035
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:49,230
Thank you.

1036
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:54,030
- Vivian, hi. David Morse. - Excuse me.

1037
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:56,030
- David. - How are ya?

1038
01:11:56,110 --> 01:11:58,660
- I'm okay. - I thought that was you. I like this hat.

1039
01:11:58,740 --> 01:12:01,720
- It's new. Yeah? - Yeah. Thanks.

1040
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:05,060
- Come meet my horse, Vivian. - Well, Edward's waiting for me.

1041
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:08,020
- He's right here. - Okay, I'll- Just for a second, though.

1042
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:09,980
I didn't know you were playing today.

1043
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:13,480
Uh, I was asking for directions. There she was.

1044
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,270
Oh, so you just ran into her? That's great. Jesus.

1045
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:20,610
So anyway, what does she do? Does she work?

1046
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,820
- She's in sales. - Sales? That's terrific. That's good.

1047
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:25,830
What does she sell?

1048
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:29,250
Why do you want to know?

1049
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:33,830
Just hear me out on this. I've known you a long time.

1050
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,670
I see some differences in you this week, like the tie, and, uh-

1051
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,090
I'm wondering if maybe this girl isn't the difference,

1052
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:44,430
especially when I see her talking to David Morse.

1053
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:50,810
- I introduced them at dinner the other night. - So what?

1054
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:53,810
Now they're best friends? This girl appears out of nowhere.

1055
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:57,230
Now she's talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy. Convenient, don't you think?

1056
01:12:57,270 --> 01:13:00,190
- Don't be ridiculous. - How do you know that this girl...

1057
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:03,200
hasn't attached herself to you because she's bringing information back to Morse?

1058
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,570
- This happens! Industrial espionage- - Phil, Phil, Phil!

1059
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:07,780
- Phil, listen to me. - What?

1060
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:11,870
- She's not a spy. She is a hooker. - Oh!

1061
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,870
She is a hooker.

1062
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:18,000
I picked her up on Hollywood Boulevard.

1063
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:20,010
In your car.

1064
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:26,590
- Oh, you are- - Yes, yes.

1065
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,810
Oh, man!

1066
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:31,980
You're the only millionaire I ever heard of...

1067
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:35,770
who goes looking for a bargain basement streetwalker, you know?

1068
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:38,320
- Edward! - I'm sorry I told you.

1069
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:42,070
Senator. Senator Adams, I'm pleased you could make it.

1070
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:44,570
Thank you. I hope the information I gave you was helpful.

1071
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:47,030
Oh, absolutely, yes, and thank you for it. There's no change, is there?

1072
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,160
No, it's still bogged down.

1073
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,790
- Having a nice time, Vivian? - Yeah, I'm having a great time.

1074
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:58,790
Must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard, hmm?

1075
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,460
What?

1076
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:04,510
Yeah, Edward told me.

1077
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:08,510
But don't worry; you're secret is safe with me.

1078
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:12,890
Listen, maybe, uh, you and I could get together sometime...

1079
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:14,890
after Edward leaves.

1080
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:18,860
Yeah, sure. Why not?

1081
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:22,360
We'll just have to do that, hmm?

1082
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,360
Philip.

1083
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,370
Hi, tailgaters.

1084
01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:30,700
I'd like to mention a couple of our silver sponsors:

1085
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:33,330
Jacobs Distributors, Norrell Saddlery,

1086
01:14:33,370 --> 01:14:37,170
and we'd like to give a great big thanks to our platinum sponsor,

1087
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:41,040
Edward Lewis Enterprises.

1088
01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:43,920
The ball is in for chukker number four.

1089
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:55,310
- You all right? - I'm fine.

1090
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:59,650
Fine. That's good. Seven "fines" since we left the match.

1091
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:01,650
Could I have another word, please?

1092
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:03,650
Asshole! There's a word.

1093
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:07,030
I think I liked "fine" better.

1094
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:11,410
You know what? Just tell me one thing: Why did you make me get all dressed up?

1095
01:15:11,490 --> 01:15:13,910
Well, for one thing, the clothing was appropriate.

1096
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:17,750
No, what I mean is, if you were gonna tell everybody I'm a hooker,

1097
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:20,420
- why didn't you just let me wear my own clothes, okay? - I did not- I did not-

1098
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:23,460
I mean, in my own clothes, when someone like that guy Stuckey comes up to me,

1099
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:26,300
I can handle it; I'm prepared.

1100
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:31,260
I'm very sorry. I'm not happy with Stuckey at all for saying or doing that.

1101
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:34,430
But he is my attorney. I've known him for ten years.

1102
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:38,060
He thought you were some kind of industrial spy. The guy's paranoid.

1103
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:41,190
Are you my pimp now? You think you can pass me around to your friends?

1104
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:45,230
- I'm not some little toy! - Look, I know you're not my toy. Vivian!

1105
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:48,150
Vivian, I'm speaking to you. Come back here!

1106
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,860
I hate to point out the obvious, but you are, in fact, a hooker!

1107
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:53,700
- And you are my employee! - Look, you don't own me. I decide, okay?

1108
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:56,700
I say who; I say when; I- I say who-

1109
01:15:56,750 --> 01:16:00,370
I refuse to spend the next three days fighting with you. I said I was sorry. I meant it.

1110
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:03,130
That's the end of it!

1111
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:05,130
I'm sorry I ever met you.

1112
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:08,880
I'm sorry I ever got into your stupid car!

1113
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:12,050
As if you had so many more appealing options.

1114
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:18,600
I've never had anyone make me feel as cheap as you did today.

1115
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,690
Somehow, I find that very hard to believe.

1116
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:31,070
Where are you going?

1117
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:34,570
I want my money. I want to get out of here.

1118
01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:22,540
Come on!

1119
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,720
I'm sorry.

1120
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:42,390
I wasn't prepared to answer questions about us.

1121
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:47,940
It was stupid and cruel.

1122
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:49,940
I didn't mean it.

1123
01:17:50,030 --> 01:17:53,320
I don't want you to go.

1124
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:57,280
- Will you stay the week? - Why?

1125
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:04,290
I saw you talking to David Morse; I didn't like it.

1126
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:06,710
We were just talking.

1127
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,260
I didn't like it.

1128
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:17,590
Down?

1129
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,480
You hurt me.

1130
01:18:32,730 --> 01:18:34,690
Yes.

1131
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,530
Don't do it again.

1132
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:04,930
First guy I ever loved was a total nothing.

1133
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:06,940
Second was worse.

1134
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:08,940
My mom called me a bum magnet.

1135
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:13,690
If there was a bum within a 50-mile radius, I was completely attracted to him.

1136
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:17,030
That's how I ended up here. I followed bum number three.

1137
01:19:17,110 --> 01:19:19,030
Oh.

1138
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:22,870
So here I was: no money, no friends, no bum.

1139
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,790
And you chose this as your profession?

1140
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:33,590
I worked at a couple fast food places,

1141
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:36,760
parked cars at wrestling.

1142
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,720
And I couldn't make the rent. I was too ashamed to go home.

1143
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,930
That's when I met Kit.

1144
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:45,930
She was a hooker and made it sound so great.

1145
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:48,940
So one day I did it.

1146
01:19:50,770 --> 01:19:52,940
I cried the whole time.

1147
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:58,280
But then I got some regulars and, you know-

1148
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:02,780
It's not like anybody plans this; it's not your childhood dream.

1149
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:09,000
You could be so much more.

1150
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:15,630
People put you down enough, you start to believe it.

1151
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:23,010
I think you are a very bright, very special woman.

1152
01:20:24,430 --> 01:20:28,140
The bad stuff is easier to believe.

1153
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:30,690
You ever notice that?

1154
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:42,740
- Tell him I'll call him on Monday. - Yes, sir.

1155
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:45,740
- Where you going? Did he sign these? - No, he said he had to leave.

1156
01:20:45,830 --> 01:20:48,870
- Edward, you can't disappear now. We're in this too deep. - Don't panic, Philip.

1157
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:51,410
Morse isn't going anywhere. I'll be back here in the morning.

1158
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,580
- Did you send the tickets to the hotel? Thank you. - Yes, sir.

1159
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:55,590
- Where are you going? - I have a date.

1160
01:20:55,670 --> 01:20:57,590
With the hooker?

1161
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:03,390
Be careful, Philip.

1162
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,700
- Do I look okay? - Mmm.

1163
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:29,370
- Mmm? - Something's missing.

1164
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:33,460
Well, nothin' else is gonna fit into this dress. I'll tell ya that.

1165
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,460
Well, maybe something in this box.

1166
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:39,500
I don't want you to get too excited. This is only on loan.

1167
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:47,510
Oh!

1168
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:51,020
They really let you borrow this from the jewelry store?

1169
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:53,730
I'm a very good customer.

1170
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:56,060
If you were gonna buy this, how much would it cost?

1171
01:21:56,150 --> 01:21:58,860
Quarter of a million.

1172
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:00,900
A quarter of a million dollars?

1173
01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:08,910
So, where we goin'?

1174
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:10,910
It's a surprise.

1175
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:17,750
If I forget to tell you later, I had a really good time tonight.

1176
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:19,540
Thank you.

1177
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:41,980
When you're not fidgeting, you look very beautiful...

1178
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:43,940
and very tall.

Well, it should be a pretty smooth flight, Mr. Lewis.

1191
01:23:29,450 --> 01:23:31,450
The weather is clear all the way up to San Francisco.

1192
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:34,490
We should be there in about 50 minutes.

1193
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:48,800
- We're late. - No, it's all right.

1194
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:53,010
- Opening night never starts on time. - Okay.

1195
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,020
- Program, sir. - Thank you.

1196
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:00,560
How nice to meet you.

1197
01:24:04,190 --> 01:24:06,610
Right this way, Mr. Lewis, sir.

1198
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:13,950
- Doris, how nice to see you. - How are you?

1199
01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:16,370
- Sir. Wonderful news. Congratulations. - Good evening, Edward.

1200
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:18,710
- Hey, come here. You gotta look at this. - It's all right.

1201
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:23,500
- I've already seen it. - If you're afraid of heights, why do you get seats up here?

1202
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:25,920
Because they're the best.

1203
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,170
- Is there anything else, sir? - No, thank you.

1204
01:24:28,210 --> 01:24:32,050
- The glasses are there. Enjoy the opera. - Oh!

1205
01:24:32,090 --> 01:24:35,560
- So, you said this is in Italian. - Uh-huh.

1206
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:38,770
So how am I gonna know what they're singin'? These are broken.

1207
01:24:38,850 --> 01:24:42,350
- Mine are broken. - No, no. That's okay It's all right.

1208
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,360
- Oh. - You'll know. Believe me, you'll understand.

1209
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,360
The music's very powerful.

1210
01:24:50,450 --> 01:24:52,570
There's a band!

1211
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:58,830
People's reactions to opera the first time they see it is very dramatic.

1212
01:24:58,910 --> 01:25:01,750
They either love it or they hate it.

1213
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:04,750
If they love it, they will always love it.

1214
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:07,750
If they don't, they may learn to appreciate it,

1215
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:11,930
but it will never become part of their soul.

1216
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:14,930
Mmm.

1217
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:12,670
- Did you enjoy the opera, dear? - Oh, it was so good, I almost peed in my pants.

1218
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:14,760
What?

1219
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:18,760
She said she liked it better than Pirates of Penzance.

1220
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,760
- Oh! - Yes.

1221
01:27:20,850 --> 01:27:22,760
Good-bye now.

1222
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,690
- No, don't touch- - I moved the queen. I like the queen.

1223
01:27:30,730 --> 01:27:32,900
You can't move the queen.

1224
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:34,820
Did you really do that?

1225
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:41,740
Why don't we finish this tomorrow? It's really late, and I have to work.

1226
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:46,160
Why don't you not go to work tomorrow. Take the day off.

1227
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:49,080
- Me, not work? - Yeah.

1228
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,500
I do own the company.

1229
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:10,190
Here are the storage reports you wanted, and Mr. Lewis called.

1230
01:28:10,230 --> 01:28:14,360
- What'd he say? - He said he's taking the day off.

1231
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,240
- He's taking the day off? - That's what he said.

1232
01:28:20,030 --> 01:28:24,620
I'm starving. There's a snap dog vendor over there. Do you have any money?

1233
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:27,040
I have money. I don't know what a snap dog is, but I have money.

1234
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:30,790
Well, I'm gonna give, um - you'll buy a snap dog; we'll cop a squat under a tree somewhere.

1235
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:32,790
- Cop a what? - Cop a squat.

1236
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,800
All right, read the first two pages.

1237
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,670
Okay.

1238
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,680
Mmm.

1239
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:45,350
I was talking to someone.

1240
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,230
He sleeps.

1241
01:31:56,670 --> 01:31:58,630
I love you.

1242
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:12,640
What are you thinkin' about sittin' here all by yourself?

1243
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:17,730
The fact that this will be our last night together, and you'll finally be rid of me.

1244
01:32:17,810 --> 01:32:21,360
Well, you've been pretty tough to take.

1245
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:24,860
My business is almost over, so I'll be going back to New York.

1246
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:31,620
I'd really like to see you again.

1247
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:34,040
- You would? - Yes.

1248
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:38,790
Yes, I would, so I've arranged for you to have an apartment, to have a car,

1249
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:43,340
a wide variety of stores guaranteed to suck up to you anytime you want to go shopping.

1250
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:47,840
- Everything's done. - What else?

1251
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:50,800
You gonna leave some money by the bed when you pass through town?

1252
01:32:51,890 --> 01:32:54,220
Vivian, it really wouldn't be like that.

1253
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:56,600
How would it be?

1254
01:32:56,690 --> 01:33:02,020
- Well, for one thing, it would get you off the streets. - That's just geography.

1255
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:15,620
Vivian, what is it you want?

1256
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:20,540
What do you see happening between us?

1257
01:33:20,580 --> 01:33:22,880
I don't know.

1258
01:33:26,510 --> 01:33:29,510
When I was a little girl,

1259
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:34,890
my mama used to lock me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often.

1260
01:33:34,930 --> 01:33:39,100
And I would- I would pretend I was a princess...

1261
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:41,810
trapped in a tower by a wicked queen.

1262
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:46,320
And then suddenly this knight...

1263
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:53,070
on a white horse with these colors flying would come charging up and draw his sword.

1264
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:54,870
And I would wave.

1265
01:33:54,910 --> 01:33:58,540
And he would climb up the tower and rescue me.

1266
01:34:02,290 --> 01:34:04,290
But never in all the time...

1267
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:09,260
that I had this dream did the knight say to me,

1268
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:12,720
"Come on, baby, I'll put you up in a great condo. "

1269
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,310
- Yes. - I had to call.

1270
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,820
I just got off the phone with James Morse. Get this.

1271
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:28,320
- He wants to meet with you today. - What about?

1272
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:31,990
He wouldn't say. Edward, I think we got him. His nuts are on the block.

1273
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:33,990
We got him!

1274
01:34:34,070 --> 01:34:37,790
Look, if he's really caving in, I want to get him to commit his stocks to us this afternoon.

1275
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:41,000
No, it's no good. If he's really caving in, I don't want to wait 'til this afternoon.

1276
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:44,000
Have Morse meet me downtown this morning. Good-bye.

1277
01:34:51,970 --> 01:34:54,800
I have to go now,

1278
01:34:54,890 --> 01:34:58,680
but I want you to understand...

1279
01:34:58,770 --> 01:35:00,680
I heard everything you said.

1280
01:35:02,140 --> 01:35:05,310
This is all I'm capable of right now.

1281
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:07,320
It's a very big step for me.

1282
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:13,490
I know. It's a really good offer for a girl like me.

1283
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:18,160
I've never treated you like a prostitute.

1284
01:35:24,830 --> 01:35:26,750
You just did.

1285
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:32,300
It's Barnard Thompson here, Miss Vivian.

1286
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:36,220
Could you come down to the front desk? There's someone here who wants to speak to you.

1287
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:38,810
- She says her name is Miss De Luca- - Let me talk to her.

1288
01:35:38,890 --> 01:35:42,180
Let me- Let me just talk to her.

1289
01:35:42,270 --> 01:35:47,190
Yo, Viv, babe. Would you come down here? The sphincter police won't let me through.

1290
01:35:47,230 --> 01:35:49,820
- Okay. She's on her way. - Fine.

1291
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,860
- Mr. Thompson. - Yes.

1292
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:54,700
The window washer is refusing to come down.

1293
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:56,870
It's a Saturday. Wait here, please.

1294
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:59,370
- Watch her. - Yes, sir.

1295
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:15,970
Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For 75, the wife can watch.

1296
01:36:19,810 --> 01:36:21,640
Listen, I've been calling you.

1297
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:24,060
Yeah, I know. They told me at the Banana you were lookin' for me.

1298
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:26,100
You were supposed to come by Tuesday. I left the money at the desk.

1299
01:36:26,190 --> 01:36:28,400
- I was hidin' from Carlos. - Well, if you picked up the money,

1300
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:32,070
- you wouldn't have to hide. - I was busy. I had a life. Nino got beat up.

1301
01:36:32,150 --> 01:36:35,700
We had to visit him in the hospital, Rachel got arrested. It was a mess.

1302
01:36:35,740 --> 01:36:40,030
Anyway, I got the money. Thank you very much for saving my ass. Now Carlos can get off of it.

1303
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:42,580
You know, he was talkin' about you last night.

1304
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:44,580
He would bust somethin' if he saw you in this outfit.

1305
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:48,880
I was afraid to hug you up there. I might wrinkle you!

1306
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:53,510
- You look really good. No, something with shade.

1307
01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:56,220
You clean up real nice.

1308
01:36:56,260 --> 01:36:59,640
You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard lookin' like you do, not that you ever did.

1309
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:03,220
Well, thanks, but it's easy to clean up when you got money.

1310
01:37:03,270 --> 01:37:06,190
Yeah.

1311
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:09,900
- So, when does he leave? - Tomorrow.

1312
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:13,570
- You get to keep the clothes? - Yeah.

1313
01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:19,110
Edward asked me if I wanted to see him again.

1314
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:23,740
But I think, I think definitely no. It's just another week, right?

1315
01:37:23,790 --> 01:37:26,830
- "Definitely no. " - Yeah.

1316
01:37:26,910 --> 01:37:29,120
Oh, no.

1317
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:31,130
What?

1318
01:37:31,210 --> 01:37:34,250
- I know this weepy look on your face. - Oh, no, you don't!

1319
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:36,840
- You fell in love with him. - No. Kit, please. Stop it.

1320
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,840
- You've fallen in love with him? - Kit!

1321
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:42,010
- Did you kiss him? On the mouth? - Uh, yeah, I did.

1322
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:44,010
- You kissed him on the mouth? - I did. It was nice.

1323
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:47,100
You fall in love with him, and you kiss him on the mouth. Did I not teach you anything?

1324
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:51,520
Look, I'm not stupid, okay? I'm- I'm not in love with him.

1325
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:54,070
I just- I like him.

1326
01:37:54,150 --> 01:37:56,110
You like him?

1327
01:37:56,150 --> 01:37:59,450
- Yeah. - You definitely like him.

1328
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:03,490
Well, he's not a bum. He's a rich, classy guy.

1329
01:38:03,530 --> 01:38:06,620
- Who's gonna break my heart, right? - Oh, no. Come on.

1330
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:09,000
You don't know that. Hey, he asked you, right?

1331
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:12,330
Maybe you guys could, like, um, you know, get a house together.

1332
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:14,460
Like, buy some diamonds and a horse. I don't know.

1333
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:17,550
Anyway, it could work. It happens.

1334
01:38:19,510 --> 01:38:21,640
When does it happen, Kit?

1335
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:23,640
When does it really happen? Who does it really work out for?

1336
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:25,930
Did it work out for Skinny Marie or Rachel? No!

1337
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:28,350
Those were very specific cases of crackheads.

1338
01:38:28,430 --> 01:38:30,690
I just wanna know who it works out for.

1339
01:38:30,730 --> 01:38:33,690
You give me one example of somebody that we know that it happened for.

1340
01:38:33,730 --> 01:38:35,690
- Name someone? - Yeah, one person that it worked out for.

1341
01:38:35,730 --> 01:38:38,690
- You want me to give you a name or something. - Yeah.

1342
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:41,200
Oh, God, the pressure of a name.

1343
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:46,200
Cinder-fuckin'- rella.

1344
01:38:52,490 --> 01:38:55,610
Mr. Morse, you said this morning you wished to speak to Mr. Lewis.

1345
01:38:55,700 --> 01:38:57,990
Mr. Lewis is now listening.

1346
01:38:58,070 --> 01:39:03,450
I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer...

1347
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:05,460
on one condition.

1348
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:10,540
I'm not so concerned about me, but the people who are working for me.

1349
01:39:10,630 --> 01:39:12,590
It's not a problem. They'll be taken care of.

1350
01:39:12,630 --> 01:39:15,800
Well, then, gentlemen. If we could address ourselves to the contracts in front of you.

1351
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:19,140
- If you look at- - Excuse me, Phil.

1352
01:39:19,220 --> 01:39:24,100
Gentlemen, I'd like to speak to Mr. Morse alone.

1353
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,560
Thank you.

1354
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:30,270
All right, gentlemen, you heard the man. Please wait outside.

1355
01:39:32,150 --> 01:39:34,400
You too, Phil.

1356
01:39:34,490 --> 01:39:37,320
What do you mean?

1357
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:39,910
I mean I would like to speak to Mr. Morse alone.

1358
01:39:41,830 --> 01:39:46,460
- Why does he get to stay? - Please, please.

1359
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:53,420
- I'll be right outside. - Good.

1360
01:40:10,150 --> 01:40:12,190
- Is that better? - It's all right.

1361
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:16,030
- Would you like a cup of coffee? - Black.

1362
01:40:18,150 --> 01:40:21,490
Mr. Morse,

1363
01:40:21,570 --> 01:40:24,120
my interests in your company have changed.

1364
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:29,000
What is it you're after now, Mr. Lewis?

1365
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:32,210
Well, I no longer wish to buy your company and take it apart.

1366
01:40:32,290 --> 01:40:35,130
But I don't want anyone else to, either.

1367
01:40:35,170 --> 01:40:39,430
And it is still extremely vulnerable.

1368
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:44,760
So I find myself... in unfamiliar territory.

1369
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:46,770
I wanna help you.

1370
01:40:46,850 --> 01:40:49,690
Why?

1371
01:40:58,070 --> 01:41:02,160
Mr. Morse, I think we can do something very special with your company.

1372
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:04,910
What about our Navy contracts?

1373
01:41:04,990 --> 01:41:09,870
Ah, they weren't dead. Just delayed. I... bluffed a little bit.

1374
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:12,000
- You're very good at it. - Thank you very much.

1375
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:15,670
It's my job.

1376
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:18,420
I think we can leave the details up to the others.

1377
01:41:18,510 --> 01:41:22,260
I find this hard to say without sounding condescending, but...

1378
01:41:22,340 --> 01:41:26,060
I'm proud of you.

1379
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:29,270
Thank you.

1380
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:34,480
I think we can let in the other suits now.

1381
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:40,190
Let's continue the meeting.

1382
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:42,530
Come in, gentlemen. Sit down.

1383
01:41:42,610 --> 01:41:45,780
Edward, please, what was this all about?

1384
01:41:45,870 --> 01:41:49,000
It's all yours, Phil. Finish it up.

1385
01:41:51,870 --> 01:41:54,460
Hold it. Hold it. These aren't signed!

1386
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:58,210
These aren't signed! Could someone please tell me what the fuck is going on here?

1387
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:01,800
Mr. Lewis and I are going to build ships together.

1388
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:04,550
Great big ships.

1389
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,770
You know, I think I'm gonna go for a walk.

1390
01:42:08,810 --> 01:42:11,890
- Just stay here for a while. I'll be back. - Yes, sir, Mr. Lewis.

1391
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:38,840
Well, well. Hello again. I'm looking for Edward.

1392
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:41,630
Edward's not here. I thought he was with you.

1393
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:46,510
No. Uh, Edward is definitely not with me.

1394
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:52,480
No, if Edward were with me-

1395
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:57,270
When- actually, when Edward was with me,

1396
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:00,820
he didn't blow off billion dollar deals!

1397
01:43:00,860 --> 01:43:05,570
I think that, uh, Edward's with you. That's what I think.

1398
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:08,780
- Mind if I have a drink? - No.

1399
01:43:08,830 --> 01:43:10,790
No, thank you.

1400
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:15,120
Well, I'll just wait.

1401
01:43:15,210 --> 01:43:19,290
Uh, Edward will be back soon. Any minute, he'll be home.

1402
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:25,010
You know,

1403
01:43:25,090 --> 01:43:27,430
this is not home.

1404
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:30,310
This is, uh, a hotel room.

1405
01:43:30,350 --> 01:43:33,220
And, uh, you are not...

1406
01:43:33,310 --> 01:43:36,770
the little woman.

1407
01:43:36,850 --> 01:43:39,810
You're a hooker.

1408
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:42,860
Maybe you're a very good hooker, you know?

1409
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:46,740
Maybe if I do you, then I wouldn't care about losing millions of dollars.

1410
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:49,410
Because I have to be very honest with you.

1411
01:43:49,490 --> 01:43:52,370
Right now, Vivian, right now I really do care. I really do.

1412
01:43:52,410 --> 01:43:56,500
And right now I am really pissed, you know?

1413
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:59,540
Right now I am just freaking out.

1414
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,210
So maybe if I screw you, huh,

1415
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:05,880
and take you to the opera, then I could be a happy guy, just like Edward.

1416
01:44:05,970 --> 01:44:09,590
- Hey, get off me! - Hey, hey! Goddamn it!

1417
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:12,310
- Ow! - Ow!

1418
01:44:12,390 --> 01:44:15,220
- Come on! Come on! I'll pay for it. - Get off me!

1419
01:44:15,310 --> 01:44:17,310
- How much is it? Twenty bucks, thirty bucks? - Get off me! Get off me!

1420
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:20,190
- Fifty? You a $50 whore, Vivian? - What are you doing?

1421
01:44:20,230 --> 01:44:23,520
- Get off! - Stop. I don't want to hurt you! Stop it!

1422
01:44:23,570 --> 01:44:25,610
You already did, Edward!

1423
01:44:25,690 --> 01:44:28,150
- Out. Out of here. - All right, all right.

1424
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:32,120
Look, she's a whore, man. She's a goddamn- Aah!

1425
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:37,910
- Aah! Damn. - Shit. Goddamn!

1426
01:44:39,370 --> 01:44:41,540
- I think you broke my nose. - Get outta here.

1427
01:44:41,580 --> 01:44:44,880
What is wrong with you? Come on, Edward! I gave you ten years!

1428
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:49,050
- I devoted my whole life to you! - That's bullshit.

1429
01:44:49,090 --> 01:44:52,300
This is such bullshit! It's the kill you love, not me!

1430
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:55,560
I made you a very rich man doing exactly what you loved.

1431
01:44:55,640 --> 01:44:57,600
Now get outta here!

1432
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:00,940
Get out!

1433
01:45:10,610 --> 01:45:13,620
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman right across the cheek?

1434
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:17,410
Wham! And it feels like your eye is gonna explode.

1435
01:45:17,450 --> 01:45:21,120
What do they do? Do they pull you aside in high school and show you how to do this?

1436
01:45:21,210 --> 01:45:23,130
Is that- Ow.

1437
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:28,800
Not all guys hit.

1438
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:34,640
I heard about what you did with Morse.

1439
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:39,640
- That was a business decision. - It was good.

1440
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:43,440
It felt good.

1441
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:49,190
I think this is okay.

1442
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:51,150
I gotta get going.

1443
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:53,870
Yes, I noticed you're packed.

1444
01:45:53,950 --> 01:45:56,200
Why are you leaving now?

1445
01:45:58,540 --> 01:46:02,330
Edward, there'll always be some guy, even some friend of yours,

1446
01:46:02,420 --> 01:46:04,580
thinkin' he can treat me like Stuckey,

1447
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:07,210
thinking that it's allowed.

1448
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:11,470
What are you gonna do? You gonna beat up everybody?

1449
01:46:11,510 --> 01:46:14,550
That's not why you're leaving.

1450
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:19,810
Look, you made me a really nice offer.

1451
01:46:19,890 --> 01:46:23,230
And a few months ago, no problem.

1452
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:25,980
But now everything is different, and you've changed that.

1453
01:46:26,060 --> 01:46:29,860
And you can't change back.

1454
01:46:29,940 --> 01:46:31,860
I want more.

1455
01:46:33,570 --> 01:46:36,030
I know about wanting more.

1456
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:38,870
I invented the concept.

1457
01:46:38,950 --> 01:46:42,500
The question is how much more.

1458
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:46,040
I want the fairy tale.

1459
01:46:48,130 --> 01:46:50,050
Impossible relationships.

1460
01:46:52,220 --> 01:46:57,140
My special gift is impossible relationships.

1461
01:47:09,610 --> 01:47:13,700
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

1462
01:47:15,450 --> 01:47:20,990
If you ever need anything- dental floss, whatever- you give me a call.

1463
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:27,210
I had a good time.

1464
01:47:27,290 --> 01:47:29,210
Me too.

1465
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:41,760
Do you want me to get you a bellboy?

1466
01:47:41,850 --> 01:47:44,890
- No, I got it. - I'll carry this.

1467
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:46,940
Thanks.

1468
01:47:53,610 --> 01:47:57,280
Stay. Stay the night with me.

1469
01:47:57,360 --> 01:48:00,490
And not because I'm paying you, but because you want to.

1470
01:48:05,870 --> 01:48:08,330
I can't.

1471
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,720
Good-bye.

1472
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:27,560
I think you have a lot of special gifts.

1473
01:48:28,650 --> 01:48:30,560
Mmm.

1474
01:48:39,990 --> 01:48:42,950
- I didn't do it, sir. - No, no. I didn't say that.

1475
01:48:42,990 --> 01:48:46,370
I want you to call maintenance and have them deal with this. You must delegate authority.

1476
01:48:46,450 --> 01:48:48,460
- Yes, sir. - Hi, Barney.

1477
01:48:49,750 --> 01:48:53,000
Miss Vivian. Thank you.

1478
01:48:54,050 --> 01:48:56,010
I wanted to say good-bye.

1479
01:48:56,050 --> 01:48:59,010
Well, then, I gather you're not accompanying Mr. Lewis to New York.

1480
01:48:59,090 --> 01:49:03,930
Come on, Barney. You and me live in the real world... most of the time.

1481
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:07,180
Have you arranged for transportation?

1482
01:49:07,270 --> 01:49:09,190
- I'm gonna call a cab. - Allow me.

1483
01:49:09,270 --> 01:49:11,690
- Darryl. - Yes, sir.

1484
01:49:11,730 --> 01:49:14,820
Please take Miss Vivian anywhere she wishes to go.

1485
01:49:14,860 --> 01:49:16,820
Yes, sir.

1486
01:49:23,240 --> 01:49:25,200
It's been a pleasure knowing you.

1487
01:49:25,240 --> 01:49:28,080
Come and visit us again sometime.

1488
01:49:29,830 --> 01:49:31,750

Yes. Yes, that's everything.

1510
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:07,470
- I'll meet you downstairs, sir. - Thank you.

1511
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:12,890
We look so dopey.

1512
01:51:14,100 --> 01:51:17,310
San Francisco's not that great, you know.

1513
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:21,400
It's bad climate. It's foggy. It's unpredictable.

1514
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:23,530
I'll wear a sweater.

1515
01:51:23,610 --> 01:51:25,740
What are you gonna do there?

1516
01:51:25,820 --> 01:51:28,370
Get a job. Finish high school.

1517
01:51:28,450 --> 01:51:32,040
I got things I can do. I used to make pretty good grades in high school.

1518
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:35,080
Yeah, I could see that about you. I could see that.

1519
01:51:39,210 --> 01:51:41,750
Sure you won't come with me?

1520
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:44,510
And leave all this? Not in a million.

1521
01:51:45,930 --> 01:51:48,050
Come here.

1522
01:51:52,470 --> 01:51:55,350
Whoa. Whoa. What is this?

1523
01:51:56,810 --> 01:52:00,020
It's part of the Edward Lewis scholarship fund.

1524
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:02,730
We think you got a lot of potential, Kit De Luca.

1525
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:07,530
You do? You think I got potential?

1526
01:52:07,570 --> 01:52:11,740
Oh, yeah. Don't let anybody tell you different, okay?

1527
01:52:11,830 --> 01:52:14,290
Okay.

1528
01:52:14,370 --> 01:52:16,330
Take care of you.

1529
01:52:16,410 --> 01:52:18,960
No, I can't, I can't. It's your favorite.

1530
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,550
What time's your bus?

1531
01:52:23,630 --> 01:52:25,630
An hour.

1532
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:28,470
Yeah, well, I gotta split, 'cause good-byes make me crazy.

1533
01:52:28,550 --> 01:52:32,720
- So, take care of you. - Whoa.

1534
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:38,440
Mr. Lewis.

1535
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:41,230
You don't have any messages for me, do you?

1536
01:52:41,310 --> 01:52:43,780
No, I'm afraid not, sir.

1537
01:52:46,240 --> 01:52:48,320
I'll need a car to the airport also.

1538
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:50,990
Of course. Darryl will take you wherever you need to go.

1539
01:52:51,070 --> 01:52:53,280
- Darryl, the limousine out front, please? - Yes, sir.

1540
01:52:53,370 --> 01:52:56,080
Thank you, Darryl.

1541
01:52:57,660 --> 01:52:59,580
- One last thing. If you could possibly... - Yes.

1542
01:52:59,670 --> 01:53:02,750
- return this to Fred's for me, please. - Yes, of course.

1543
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:05,000
May I, sir?

1544
01:53:05,090 --> 01:53:07,590
Of course, please.

1545
01:53:14,890 --> 01:53:17,890
It must be difficult to let go of something so beautiful.

1546
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:24,570
You know, Darryl also drove Miss Vivian home yesterday.

1547
01:53:28,570 --> 01:53:30,490
I'll take care of it.

1548
01:53:31,990 --> 01:53:34,120
Thank you, Mr. Thompson.

1549
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,670
Your plane is leaving as scheduled, sir,

1550
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:51,470
and you should be back in New York on time.

1551
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:05,320
I'm gonna have to charge you a little more rent than Vivian...

1552
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:07,320
because I've got this beauty course I'm looking into.

1553
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:09,320
I'm not gonna be there that much, you know?

1554
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:11,820
'Cause you can't- You just can't turn tricks forever.

1555
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:14,240
You gotta have a goal. Do you have a goal?

1556
01:54:14,370 --> 01:54:16,450
Well, I always wanted to be in the Ice Capades.

1557
01:54:16,530 --> 01:54:20,500
- Help you, love? - There you go. Thank you very much.

1558
01:54:20,580 --> 01:54:22,830
So, you got a lot of stuff you gotta move in?

1559
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:25,880
No, Carlos burned most of my stuff when I said I was movin' out.

1560
01:54:52,860 --> 01:54:54,780
Vivian!

1561
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:56,910
Vivian.

1562
01:55:01,450 --> 01:55:05,290
Princess Vivian! Come down!

1563
01:55:09,630 --> 01:55:12,130
- Had to be the top floor, right? - It's the best.

1564
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:14,970
All right. I'm coming up.

1565
01:55:49,630 --> 01:55:54,760
So what happened after he climbed up the tower and rescued her?

1566
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:57,550
She rescues him right back.

1567
01:56:08,350 --> 01:56:11,570
Welcome to Hollywood. What's your dream?

1568
01:56:11,650 --> 01:56:16,490
Everybody comes here. This is Hollywood, the land of dreams.

1569
01:56:16,530 --> 01:56:20,830
Some dreams come true, some don't. But keep on dreamin'.

1570
01:56:20,870 --> 01:56:26,330
This is Hollywood. Always time to dream, so keep on dreamin'.
