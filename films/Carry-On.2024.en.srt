1
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:26,828
Our guardian star lost all his glow

2
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:30,899
The day that I lost you

3
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:36,036
He lost all his glitter the day you said no

4
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:39,674
And his silver turned to blue

5
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:44,278
Like him, I am doubtful

6
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:48,850
That your love is true

7
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:54,054
But if you decide to call on me

8
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:58,091
Ask for Mr. Blue

9
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:03,063
I'm Mr. Blue

10
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,899
Whoa, whoa, ooh

11
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:07,769
When you say you love me

12
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:10,203
I'm Mr. Blue

13
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:13,608
Then prove it by going out

14
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:14,842
On the sly

15
00:01:14,976 --> 00:01:18,211
Proving your love isn't true

16
00:01:20,048 --> 00:01:23,885
Call me Mr. Blue

17
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:27,722
I'm Mr. Blue

18
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:29,824
Whoa, whoa, ooh

19
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:32,426
When you say you're sorry

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,029
I'm Mr. Blue

21
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:38,265
Then turn around, heading for

22
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,767
The lights of town

23
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:43,738
Hurting me through and through

24
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:49,309
Call me Mr. Blue

25
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:54,082
-I stay at home at night -I stay at home

26
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:57,652
Right by the phone at night

27
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:01,856
-Right by the phone -But you won't call

28
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,927
And I won't hurt my pride

29
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,930
Call me Mister

30
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:12,634
I won't tell you

31
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:14,669
Whoa, whoa, ooh

32
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:19,406
-While you paint the town -I'm Mr. Blue

33
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,545
A bright red to leave it upside down

34
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:29,316
I'm painting it, too

35
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,653
But I'm painting it blue

36
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,491
Call me Mr. Blue

37
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,292
Whoa, whoa, ooh

38
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:41,428
Call me Mr. Blue

39
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:44,297
Whoa, whoa, ooh

40
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,101
Call me Mr. Blue.

41
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:56,176
Thank you.

42
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,266
Say yes.

43
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,601
Lee.

44
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:22,070
Marry me, Muriel.

45
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:25,439
You promised me an answer by Christmas.

46
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:27,274
And it's Christmas Eve.

47
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,177
And I'll give you one.

48
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,878
Right now I need a shower.

49
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:03,978
You must be her.

50
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,118
Must be.

51
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,122
Toss one of those down to me.

52
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:38,478
It's got to be freezing.

53
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:42,817
I'm Julius.

54
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:46,587
I know.

55
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,952
-Hi. -Hello.

56
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:32,300
I heard your mom left you the place.

57
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:34,769
That's right.

58
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,539
Lucky you.

59
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:40,741
I like the country.

60
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:44,477
Hmm.

61
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,486
Solitaire.

62
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:54,922
Passes the time.

63
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,160
Can play a real game, you want.

64
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:00,528
Real game like what?

65
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:02,864
Poker.

66
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,299
You'll have to teach me.

67
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:07,668
Liar.

68
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,139
Only played a few times.

69
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:14,075
You know, you don't need to keep secrets.

70
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,877
My brother's seen cards before.

71
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,345
It's no secret.

72
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,714
Lee never seemed interested in card games is all.

73
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:21,349
Yeah, that's 'cause he's not.

74
00:06:22,984 --> 00:06:24,417
Not that it matters.

75
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:43,137
See, the thing about poker is, uh, cards aren't just cards.

76
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,842
This right here is pieces of time.

77
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,043
Okay?

78
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,679
There's what's on the table

79
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:54,248
and then what's coming down the line. Follow me?

80
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:57,551
So, there's only a certain amount of cards in each deck,

81
00:06:57,685 --> 00:06:59,520
so you got some idea what's already been dealt,

82
00:06:59,654 --> 00:07:01,622
you got some idea what's gonna happen next.

83
00:07:06,294 --> 00:07:08,262
But you can't know what's already been dealt.

84
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:10,398
Well, it most certainly is frowned upon,

85
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:11,899
but that doesn't mean you can't know.

86
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:15,870
And if, uh, memory fails.

87
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:20,675
Clever.

88
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:27,648
Truth is, a real gambler's only got one solemn obligation.

89
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:28,816
What's that?

90
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,154
Staying well-informed.

91
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,222
Watch out now, Muriel. He's coming for you.

92
00:07:35,356 --> 00:07:36,691
Hey.

93
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,794
Come here, you little shit.

94
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,329
See you met this one already, huh?

95
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,031
Yeah, she's been spilling her secrets all afternoon.

96
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,134
Oh, don't worry, Muriel.

97
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:48,536
That's just the way my little brother is.

98
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:49,770
I don't mind.

99
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:51,706
Let me show you around.

100
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:55,176
We called it Hell Fire Valley

101
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,944
'cause that's exactly what it was.

102
00:07:57,078 --> 00:07:58,813
And we're running out of ammo,

103
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,681
but we all know there's more on the truck, right?

104
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:02,249
Lee, this story's been told and told again.

105
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:03,384
We all know there's more ammo

106
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:04,885
-on the truck. -Come on, now.

107
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:06,854
Chinese bullets are flying everywhere,

108
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:08,823
but no one's crazy enough to risk it.

109
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:12,126
So we figure, "That's it."

110
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,963
When all of a sudden I see this guy.

111
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:19,367
He's up there on this burning truck,

112
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,268
throwing ammo down to us

113
00:08:21,402 --> 00:08:23,371
and pushing wounded soldiers off.

114
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:27,041
It's this crazy-ass redneck right here.

115
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:32,380
I guaran-goddamn-tee you,

116
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:33,781
if it wasn't for him,

117
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:36,484
you and I would've never even met.

118
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:39,120
Wow. A hero, this brother of yours.

119
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,122
Oh, you bet.

120
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,990
Nothing but a shoulder wound.

121
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:45,359
That's how they tell it.

122
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:48,829
I guess that's why they, uh, they let me out.

123
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:51,298
Let you what?

124
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:55,870
I was discharged, um... last week.

125
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,538
Well, I got six months left.

126
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:58,706
That means you got six months left.

127
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,208
Well, not anymore.

128
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:03,411
You can still fire a gun, can't you?

129
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,246
You can still walk. We're still at war, aren't we?

130
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,447
Lee.

131
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,449
Your separation payout? Pension?

132
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,084
Nope.

133
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,055
We had a plan, didn't we, Julius?

134
00:09:14,188 --> 00:09:15,456
Pool our discharge pay

135
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:16,924
and get us a place out in California.

136
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:18,893
-That was the plan, wasn't it? -I-I got an idea.

137
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,529
-This is what he does, Muriel. -No-no, my-my idea...

138
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:21,929
-He is always holding... -No, she's got an idea.

139
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:23,030
...something back. Always.

140
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:24,298
My idea is that I-I want to dance.

141
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:33,107
I need a smoke.

142
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:56,464
You whispered...

143
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,632
-Well? -Oh.

144
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,969
Oh, I-I was just trying to smooth things over.

145
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,105
So let's smooth them over.

146
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,642
Only to learn

147
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:09,777
Mm.

148
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,782
This love is a love

149
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,784
Of no return...

150
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:26,293
He, um... he thinks so highly of you is all.

151
00:10:26,427 --> 00:10:28,395
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm all he's got.

152
00:10:30,565 --> 00:10:31,600
Besides you.

153
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:40,174
You ever been in love before?

154
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:44,845
No.

155
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:48,550
Uh, not before now, I mean.

156
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:51,752
Have you?

157
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,189
You know what I think?

158
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,595
I think you see right through all of it.

159
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,497
All of what?

160
00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:05,065
All the supposed tos.

161
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,402
All the stuff they tell you matters.

162
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:11,372
All the stuff the guys next to me in Korea

163
00:11:11,506 --> 00:11:13,841
cared so much about right up until

164
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:16,010
their brains got blown out the back of their heads.

165
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:22,349
You got room for a dumbass hick in the middle?

166
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:23,484
Mm.

167
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:25,620
Let me on in here now.

168
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:29,658
You know what?

169
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:34,862
I got the two people that I love most in the world

170
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:37,064
right here in front of me.

171
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,701
Here it comes.

172
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:44,905
Muriel Jane Edwards...

173
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,309
I've asked before.

174
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,579
Lord knows I've asked.

175
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:54,348
And I'm asking you again.

176
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,656
I'm back to Korea in 72 hours.

177
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:03,991
It's Christmas Eve.

178
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,860
Go on, now, Lee, get up.

179
00:12:06,994 --> 00:12:08,597
I know you're worried about me,

180
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,700
but nothing's gonna happen.

181
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:12,800
And besides, if it does,

182
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,068
Julius here will take care of you.

183
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:15,202
Don't say that to him.

184
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:16,638
Won't you, Julius?

185
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:18,540
Of course I will.

186
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:22,409
I can make you happy, Muriel.

187
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,448
Well?

188
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,621
-You mean it? -Yes.

189
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,855
-Pardon me, now? -Yes!

190
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:39,760
Woo-hoo!

191
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,269
We can still do it, you know?

192
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:49,870
What's that?

193
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:54,775
San Diego, California.

194
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,746
I-I got money saved.

195
00:12:58,946 --> 00:12:59,980
You serious?

196
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:02,816
I mean, that was the plan, wasn't it?

197
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,984
Sure.

198
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:08,422
But don't do it for us if it's not what you want.

199
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,092
Well, hell, I like sunshine as much as the next guy.

200
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:17,766
All three of us out in California.

201
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,167
What do you think, Muriel?

202
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,870
Well, a plan's a plan.

203
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:26,508
Yeah, but you got to promise, Julius.

204
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:28,342
Promise.

205
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:31,680
I... I promise.

206
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,156
Oh, here we go.

207
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:46,126
She's a gamblin' woman

208
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,797
I've got to let her go

209
00:13:49,798 --> 00:13:50,864
Come on, now.

210
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,466
She's a gamblin' woman

211
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,468
I've got to let her go

212
00:13:56,705 --> 00:14:00,374
She goes, plays dice She loses all my dough

213
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,210
She goes, plays dice

214
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:06,013
She loses all my dough

215
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:09,883
Dear Julius...

216
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:13,287
Maybe it won't last forever, but even Lee says

217
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,357
there's something in the air here... a feeling.

218
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:21,328
It's really true what they say about California.

219
00:14:21,462 --> 00:14:23,364
Yeah, we both got jobs just like that.

220
00:14:23,497 --> 00:14:24,566
You believe it?

221
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,201
It's like that here.

222
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:29,571
You never know what's just around the bend.

223
00:14:30,505 --> 00:14:32,139
Like anything is possible.

224
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:35,376
As if the odds are stacked in your favor.

225
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:40,180
I heard about a card game for you down by the docks.

226
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:43,685
So get out here and make us all rich.

227
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,754
We sure could use it.

228
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:50,224
I hope that new job in Stockton's working out.

229
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:55,329
With love and high hopes to see you soon.

230
00:14:55,864 --> 00:14:57,931
Muriel and Lee.

231
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,033
She's a gamblin' woman

232
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,703
Well, I've got to let her go

233
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:05,607
She goes, plays dice

234
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,009
She loses all my dough

235
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:11,111
Gives me trouble

236
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,950
Hey, so, Rosie, uh, what's your feminine intuition

237
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,219
tell you about, uh, Lone Sailor?

238
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:22,757
Track's running cuppy, and he's all rode out.

239
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:25,426
Smart money's on Pastoral in the sixth.

240
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,796
No shit? Ten to one?

241
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,063
Money like that'd solve anybody's problems.

242
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:31,131
Ain't that right, Rosie?

243
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,634
Anybody who's got the stomach.

244
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:34,268
What do you got in-in the third?

245
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,336
-Got Magic Hour. -Magic Hour?

246
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,010
Oh.

247
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:44,813
-Here you go. -Thank you, baby.

248
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,594
Those new houses going up in the Valley.

249
00:16:00,562 --> 00:16:02,664
Just... something to think about.

250
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:11,739
We talked this through, Lee.

251
00:16:11,873 --> 00:16:13,407
We can't afford this right now.

252
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,109
Sell your ma's place back in Kansas.

253
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,112
My mother worked her whole life for that house.

254
00:16:19,914 --> 00:16:21,816
Right, but that was her dream, Muriel.

255
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,150
This is ours.

256
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:25,018
So I don't have a choice?

257
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:30,324
That's the house I grew up in.

258
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:34,361
I shouldn't have said anything.

259
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:22,042
Uh...

260
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,378
$20 on Pastoral in the sixth to win.

261
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,878
And here they come.

262
00:17:57,011 --> 00:17:59,112
Othello's fading back now as Pastoral heads up the outside

263
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,648
coming into the final stretch.

264
00:18:00,782 --> 00:18:02,951
It's Pastoral and Lone Sailor, Mother's Helper in third.

265
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,118
Now it's Pastoral and Mother's Helper one and two.

266
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,554
Pastoral and Mother's Helper.

267
00:18:06,688 --> 00:18:07,689
It's Pastoral and Mother's Helper.

268
00:18:07,822 --> 00:18:09,624
And here we go, into the finish.

269
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:11,391
Mother's Helper, Pastoral.

270
00:18:11,526 --> 00:18:12,594
It's Pastoral and Mother's Helper.

271
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:14,161
It's Pastoral!

272
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,463
Pastoral takes the win!

273
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:21,035
I'd like an envelope, please.

274
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:43,591
You ought to take a game like yours out to the desert.

275
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:45,760
Yeah? Why's that?

276
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:49,530
Open all night, no cops, $20 buy-ins.

277
00:18:49,664 --> 00:18:50,932
Just like Korea.

278
00:18:52,066 --> 00:18:53,300
The good parts, anyway.

279
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:54,769
This round's on me.

280
00:18:54,902 --> 00:18:56,403
-You fucking kidding me? -Sit back down.

281
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:58,773
-Classic hit-and-run. -Oh, come on.

282
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:18,026
You play a real tight game, don't you?

283
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,929
Feel like a nightcap?

284
00:19:22,063 --> 00:19:23,831
Probably not tonight, friend.

285
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,834
Probably not?

286
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:30,237
Hey, somebody's a little ginned up, huh?

287
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,574
You looking for company?

288
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,945
Twenty bucks, I could be, yeah.

289
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,212
Okay.

290
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,418
-What the hell is this, man? -Hey.

291
00:19:44,552 --> 00:19:47,421
Easy. Relax.

292
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:49,322
Get your fucking hands off me.

293
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:53,360
Oh.

294
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,228
Now I'm impressed.

295
00:20:03,171 --> 00:20:04,204
Jackpot.

296
00:20:59,527 --> 00:21:00,595
Hello?

297
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:02,096
That you, Kansas?

298
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,231
Julius?

299
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:05,432
Are you waiting on somebody else?

300
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:09,604
Where are you?

301
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:12,106
Now, how is that card game shaping up?

302
00:21:13,174 --> 00:21:15,576
I-I've been playing the horses.

303
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,310
-You have not. -Yeah.

304
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,247
I'm waiting tables at this little place,

305
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,582
and it's all horsemen, so I've been taking notes.

306
00:21:21,716 --> 00:21:23,584
No shit? You remembered.

307
00:21:23,718 --> 00:21:25,620
Yeah, a real gambler's only solemn obligation

308
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:27,088
is staying well-informed.

309
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:29,322
That's a nice racket for a gal.

310
00:21:30,124 --> 00:21:32,126
Oh, I bet nobody sees you coming.

311
00:21:32,894 --> 00:21:34,996
-Just for fun, really. -Well, be careful now.

312
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,533
Might be one of those things you can't ever get enough of.

313
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:43,303
We sure hoped you'd be here by now.

314
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:46,841
Lee sure does miss you.

315
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:49,677
Lee just wants that happy little home that we never had.

316
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:51,846
Well, what's wrong with that?

317
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:54,347
Say, how about you?

318
00:21:55,683 --> 00:21:57,118
Is that what you want?

319
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:00,453
I...

320
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,858
I thought we had a plan.

321
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:05,392
I, uh, I lost my share.

322
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:07,962
I-I got a way to make it back, I just got to...

323
00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:09,797
I got to go on my own steam.

324
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:12,399
I think you understand that.

325
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,203
I don't think I do, but...

326
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:18,272
give me your address and I'll send you some money

327
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:19,540
for a bus ticket.

328
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:26,314
Uh, you can send it, uh, care of me,

329
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:28,649
Western Union, Stockton.

330
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:34,188
Oh, and, uh, don't tell Lee, uh...

331
00:22:35,156 --> 00:22:36,724
I want to surprise him.

332
00:22:36,858 --> 00:22:38,893
Okay. Okay, thank you.

333
00:22:39,794 --> 00:22:40,862
Bye, now, Nathaniel.

334
00:22:41,996 --> 00:22:45,365
Uh, just the neighbor boy checking on Ma's house for us.

335
00:22:56,744 --> 00:22:58,679
To Mrs. Lee Walker,

336
00:22:58,813 --> 00:23:00,848
Western Union, San Diego.

337
00:23:01,716 --> 00:23:03,184
Muriel, sorry.

338
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:05,385
Change of plans.

339
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,022
Unexpected opportunities have come up.

340
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:09,257
Back as soon as I can.

341
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:12,693
Wish me luck in Sin City. Julius.

342
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:14,662
Lucky number seven...

343
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:17,531
See the moon above the mountain

344
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:18,900
Winner, 11. Front line winner.

345
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,637
Go. No more bet. No more bets.

346
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,208
Watch the stars Light up the sky

347
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:29,543
Yes!

348
00:23:30,878 --> 00:23:33,413
Oh, wherever

349
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:37,718
You are, darlin'

350
00:23:37,852 --> 00:23:39,787
Do you feel

351
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:42,323
The same

352
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:44,625
As I?

353
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:50,264
Do you ever

354
00:23:50,398 --> 00:23:53,466
Long to see me?

355
00:23:56,704 --> 00:23:59,340
Do you ever

356
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:03,210
Feel this blue?

357
00:24:03,511 --> 00:24:04,812
Hey, darling.

358
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,716
Oh, wherever

359
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:11,819
You are, darlin'

360
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,523
Do you know

361
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:18,326
I'm missing you?

362
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,561
Just think... Twenty-five bucks a month,

363
00:24:20,695 --> 00:24:23,397
by the time we're 50, this could all be ours.

364
00:24:23,531 --> 00:24:26,267
If I could feel your arms...

365
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:35,009
Come on.

366
00:24:35,977 --> 00:24:38,112
We'll be the first ones in here.

367
00:24:38,245 --> 00:24:39,613
Developer says he can sell us

368
00:24:39,747 --> 00:24:41,682
this model here for 10% off.

369
00:24:41,816 --> 00:24:44,151
And this tract's the best of them.

370
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:46,287
It's $2,000 for the land,

371
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,323
build-out's another four, maybe six.

372
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:51,959
That's hardly anything, considering.

373
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:54,161
Considering what?

374
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:55,529
How fast this will go.

375
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:59,033
We'll get at least a few grand for your mother's place, right?

376
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:07,141
But you promised your brother we'd all do this together.

377
00:25:08,275 --> 00:25:10,011
What is it with you and waiting on him?

378
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:13,047
See my brother around here anywhere?

379
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:16,817
You know what Julius said?

380
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:19,820
He said it was good that I was marrying you.

381
00:25:19,954 --> 00:25:21,389
He said, "That sad girl, she needs someone

382
00:25:21,522 --> 00:25:22,790
to tell her what to do."

383
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:29,263
Muriel.

384
00:25:29,797 --> 00:25:30,831
Muriel.

385
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,042
Stop. Stop there.

386
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:42,476
Stop there? Why?

387
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,878
I want to buy some olives.

388
00:25:44,678 --> 00:25:46,047
You want to buy some olives?

389
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:48,382
Yes.

390
00:25:48,517 --> 00:25:49,550
Sure.

391
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:09,504
Come in!

392
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:21,282
Out back.

393
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:32,259
Lost?

394
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:35,796
Uh, no, your sign? Olives?

395
00:26:36,764 --> 00:26:38,032
That was the Garcias',

396
00:26:38,165 --> 00:26:40,134
next door, before they tore the place down.

397
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:42,537
Oh.

398
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:46,006
You really want some, I got some.

399
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,677
Looking at land, huh?

400
00:26:50,811 --> 00:26:52,346
-We are. -Hmm.

401
00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:54,415
Now's the time, I hear.

402
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:06,961
Uh, that was real nice,

403
00:27:07,094 --> 00:27:08,530
what you were playing on the guitar.

404
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,898
-It's not a guitar. -Oh.

405
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:14,635
-Give it here. -Sorry.

406
00:27:16,103 --> 00:27:17,606
Never had an olive.

407
00:27:20,141 --> 00:27:21,175
There's a pit.

408
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:22,710
Oh.

409
00:27:24,011 --> 00:27:25,346
What do I do with it?

410
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:39,493
You on your own here, then?

411
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:44,365
Could use some eggs, if you're gonna shop.

412
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:47,334
Got some laid fresh this morning.

413
00:27:53,974 --> 00:27:55,309
How much do we owe you for it?

414
00:27:56,545 --> 00:27:58,779
Doesn't feel right selling you the olives.

415
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:00,314
It wasn't me you really wanted.

416
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:03,817
Oh, then we'll have to overpay you for the eggs.

417
00:28:03,951 --> 00:28:05,352
I've got money, Lee.

418
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:08,889
Thanks.

419
00:28:23,505 --> 00:28:24,539
You've got it.

420
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:28,876
Mind if I drive?

421
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,145
No.

422
00:28:42,957 --> 00:28:44,058
You're right.

423
00:28:45,527 --> 00:28:46,595
Let's do it.

424
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:48,697
Let's get the house.

425
00:28:50,431 --> 00:28:51,498
What?

426
00:28:52,199 --> 00:28:54,603
Really? You mean that?

427
00:29:03,244 --> 00:29:07,214
Well, there's a time and a place for everything

428
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,553
Whoa, there's a time to be nice

429
00:29:11,686 --> 00:29:14,088
And a time for play

430
00:29:15,523 --> 00:29:17,925
Oh, baby, there's a time to be true

431
00:29:18,058 --> 00:29:20,194
And a time to be cheatin'

432
00:29:22,396 --> 00:29:24,566
Oh, there's a time to be bitter

433
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:28,135
And a time to be sweet...

434
00:29:31,706 --> 00:29:33,073
Say, I got a question.

435
00:29:35,776 --> 00:29:38,779
The, uh, the work you fellas do here,

436
00:29:40,281 --> 00:29:41,583
you got any openings?

437
00:29:41,982 --> 00:29:43,484
Entry level, of course.

438
00:29:45,286 --> 00:29:46,887
What skills do you have to offer?

439
00:29:48,556 --> 00:29:51,292
Well, I know how people steal and I know why they do.

440
00:29:52,761 --> 00:29:54,495
You yourself do not steal.

441
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,165
And partly, I know how people steal

442
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:00,635
'cause I've stolen in the past, I'll be honest with you.

443
00:30:01,703 --> 00:30:03,505
Well, this doesn't really seem like the kind of place

444
00:30:03,638 --> 00:30:04,739
to steal from,

445
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:07,575
and I'd like to stay on the right side of that.

446
00:30:09,943 --> 00:30:11,613
We've seen you around, you play aboveboard.

447
00:30:11,746 --> 00:30:12,846
We like that.

448
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:15,784
Blackjack's the only casino game

449
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:18,018
where the gambler can get an edge over the house.

450
00:30:18,152 --> 00:30:20,087
For that reason it attracts cheaters of all kinds.

451
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,989
-Do you agree? -I sure do.

452
00:30:23,057 --> 00:30:24,224
Pit surveillance?

453
00:30:27,696 --> 00:30:29,496
Simple, you see something, you say something.

454
00:30:29,631 --> 00:30:30,831
We take it from there.

455
00:30:30,964 --> 00:30:33,267
Two-way mirrors looking down on the floor.

456
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,537
You can see them, but they can't see you.

457
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,471
Call box up top.

458
00:30:37,605 --> 00:30:39,206
Spot a sharper, you phone it in.

459
00:31:15,142 --> 00:31:17,512
That's my girl. Woo-hoo!

460
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:19,346
Clever.

461
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:46,373
You're new.

462
00:31:47,374 --> 00:31:49,109
-Yeah? -Yeah.

463
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:52,112
Henry.

464
00:31:52,747 --> 00:31:53,882
Julius.

465
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:58,485
First time?

466
00:31:59,554 --> 00:32:01,021
It is, yeah.

467
00:32:01,155 --> 00:32:02,990
What do you think so far?

468
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:06,761
It's instructive.

469
00:32:06,895 --> 00:32:08,696
Only maybe there's such a thing

470
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,063
as knowing too much.

471
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:12,966
Yeah, maybe there is.

472
00:32:14,736 --> 00:32:15,770
Okey dokey.

473
00:32:15,904 --> 00:32:17,137
I'll see you around.

474
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:22,911
I'll wait for positions tomorrow.

475
00:32:23,043 --> 00:32:24,612
Then I'll take that Roustabout cash,

476
00:32:24,746 --> 00:32:26,815
put it all on Flood in the seventh.

477
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:28,982
What? Flood's too young.

478
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:30,384
Jumpy as a virgin.

479
00:32:30,518 --> 00:32:32,119
You boys do what you want, but at six to one,

480
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:34,656
that horse is a monster in sheep's clothing.

481
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:35,956
Sounds like some people we know.

482
00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:54,975
You're looking at my scar.

483
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:56,176
Sorry.

484
00:32:56,878 --> 00:32:58,145
Why?

485
00:32:58,278 --> 00:32:59,346
You didn't do it.

486
00:33:07,287 --> 00:33:09,189
115 degrees today.

487
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:11,593
Tomorrow, too.

488
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,796
Well, the heat's just fine with me.

489
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,333
You okay?

490
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:59,072
Oh, whoa, whoa. Hey, come on, come on.

491
00:33:59,874 --> 00:34:01,843
Hey, hey, come on.

492
00:34:02,911 --> 00:34:04,211
Come on, now.

493
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:05,379
Okay.

494
00:34:24,832 --> 00:34:25,867
Hey.

495
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:28,135
Ain't going home, are you?

496
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:29,369
Was planning on it.

497
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,238
I owe you a drink for before.

498
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,908
What is this? What is this, some kind of hustle?

499
00:34:34,042 --> 00:34:35,442
Ain't no hustle. I got something

500
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:37,444
-to show you, that's all. -Oh, yeah? What's that?

501
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:39,413
America.

502
00:34:48,121 --> 00:34:49,289
Thanks, man.

503
00:34:52,026 --> 00:34:53,061
Hey.

504
00:34:54,294 --> 00:34:55,663
Mira.

505
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:57,899
Call this an atomic cocktail.

506
00:34:58,265 --> 00:34:59,333
Salud.

507
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:01,836
Oh, I don't think this is such a good idea.

508
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,103
Why's that?

509
00:35:03,738 --> 00:35:05,405
When boss men see us palling around,

510
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,240
they're liable to think we got an angle.

511
00:35:08,408 --> 00:35:10,612
This is Vegas.

512
00:35:10,745 --> 00:35:11,813
So?

513
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,649
So they know we got an angle.

514
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:16,416
-Five! -There's no other reason

515
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:19,319
-to be here. -Four, three,

516
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:21,823
two, one!

517
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:27,528
They test the fuckers once a month out at the base.

518
00:35:27,662 --> 00:35:29,129
We got a front-row seat.

519
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:33,433
See? I told you.

520
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:35,402
America.

521
00:35:40,908 --> 00:35:41,976
Hey.

522
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,645
Hey.

523
00:35:44,545 --> 00:35:45,647
What's all this?

524
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,848
I'm just calling it.

525
00:35:47,649 --> 00:35:49,617
-You are, huh? -Yep.

526
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:51,451
Give me a smoke.

527
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:03,196
Give me a light.

528
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:10,437
Mm.

529
00:36:10,571 --> 00:36:11,806
Know any good jokes?

530
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:14,509
I bet you do.

531
00:36:16,511 --> 00:36:17,645
Get out of here.

532
00:36:19,013 --> 00:36:20,480
Sir, yes, sir.

533
00:36:41,169 --> 00:36:44,237
There's a life

534
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:47,909
I've always wanted

535
00:36:51,145 --> 00:36:54,347
I can't say

536
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:57,919
That I'm living it now

537
00:37:00,088 --> 00:37:02,389
But someday

538
00:37:03,658 --> 00:37:05,526
Someday

539
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,862
I could

540
00:37:07,995 --> 00:37:10,031
Know how

541
00:37:38,726 --> 00:37:40,094
The fuck is this?

542
00:37:44,766 --> 00:37:47,135
-What are you doing? -Hey. Hey.

543
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:48,770
Tranquilo.

544
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:51,606
No, I don't...

545
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:53,741
Hi, friend

546
00:37:55,576 --> 00:37:58,345
Can I meet you again?

547
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:02,315
Time lost

548
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:04,652
And won and lost

549
00:38:04,786 --> 00:38:06,954
And won and then

550
00:38:10,558 --> 00:38:13,094
I burned the bridge of my life

551
00:38:13,227 --> 00:38:16,564
To get to you

552
00:38:18,533 --> 00:38:21,002
I'm a runner, I'm a runner

553
00:38:21,135 --> 00:38:25,305
You're the lover I'm running to

554
00:39:13,955 --> 00:39:16,824
-$200 on Roustabout to win. -Yes, ma'am.

555
00:39:22,597 --> 00:39:24,799
And it's Sayonara breaking on the outside,

556
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:26,234
Roustabout on the inside.

557
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:28,703
Roustabout and Sayonara. Roustabout and Sayonara.

558
00:39:28,836 --> 00:39:31,606
It's Roustabout! Roustabout takes it.

559
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:39,914
Uh, ma'am?

560
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:44,417
Put it all on Flood in the seventh.

561
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:46,486
All of it, ma'am?

562
00:39:46,621 --> 00:39:47,655
Yes.

563
00:39:54,629 --> 00:39:56,496
Excuse me, is this table open?

564
00:39:57,331 --> 00:39:58,866
Oh, uh, it is.

565
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:12,780
Crowds always make me sweat.

566
00:40:23,057 --> 00:40:24,091
Who's yours?

567
00:40:24,592 --> 00:40:26,426
Oh, uh, Flood.

568
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,729
No. Me, too.

569
00:40:29,997 --> 00:40:31,498
Aren't we both brave?

570
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:34,434
-Six to one. -I like

571
00:40:34,568 --> 00:40:36,237
the look of him, though, don't you?

572
00:40:37,538 --> 00:40:38,572
I do.

573
00:40:39,206 --> 00:40:40,241
Very much.

574
00:40:44,045 --> 00:40:45,680
And they're off.

575
00:40:46,714 --> 00:40:48,149
It's Flood and Lost at Sea.

576
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:49,550
Lost at Sea holding his lead.

577
00:40:49,684 --> 00:40:51,819
Flood coming up fast, Lost at Sea and Flood.

578
00:40:51,953 --> 00:40:53,154
Lost at Sea and Flood.

579
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:54,255
Here they come.

580
00:40:54,388 --> 00:40:55,690
Flood and Lost at Sea.

581
00:40:55,823 --> 00:40:57,457
It's Flood making one last break down the rail.

582
00:40:57,591 --> 00:40:59,126
It's Flood!

583
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,728
Flood takes it!

584
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:06,200
There you are.

585
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:08,135
How did we come out?

586
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:10,338
Oh, darling.

587
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,139
-We won. -Excellent.

588
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:19,313
Goodbye.

589
00:41:20,114 --> 00:41:21,148
Bye.

590
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:31,325
$12,000.

591
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:33,027
Do be careful, ma'am.

592
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,195
Yeah.

593
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,368
Don't flatter yourself.

594
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,903
You know I would never bet on a loser.

595
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,541
Someday I'm gonna kill him in his sleep.

596
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:55,950
So...

597
00:41:59,787 --> 00:42:01,355
where are you supposed to be?

598
00:42:02,456 --> 00:42:03,491
San Diego.

599
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:05,860
With my brother.

600
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:09,897
We, uh, we planned that when we were overseas.

601
00:42:10,965 --> 00:42:14,001
I think mostly he just wants to keep an eye on me, though.

602
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:17,204
And how come you're not there?

603
00:42:23,177 --> 00:42:26,647
We never had much in the way of a family growing up.

604
00:42:26,781 --> 00:42:28,416
My mom died when I was small,

605
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:31,685
and my dad pretty much lost his marbles.

606
00:42:31,819 --> 00:42:34,655
Then we just moved around, place to place.

607
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:36,624
You know, aunts and uncles and...

608
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:39,560
My brother, he needs all that, I guess.

609
00:42:39,693 --> 00:42:42,531
You know, walls, windows, happy little home,

610
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:44,398
woman waiting at the door for him.

611
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:46,467
And what about you?

612
00:42:55,676 --> 00:42:56,877
Hey.

613
00:42:59,914 --> 00:43:02,083
I thought this was not a good idea.

614
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,385
Everybody makes mistakes.

615
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:44,024
Where the hell have you been?

616
00:43:44,158 --> 00:43:46,694
-Lee. Something happened, Lee. -What? What is it?

617
00:43:46,827 --> 00:43:47,828
I called the HeyDay.

618
00:43:47,962 --> 00:43:49,029
-They said you left hours ago. -Lee.

619
00:43:49,163 --> 00:43:50,664
This isn't farm country, Muriel.

620
00:43:50,798 --> 00:43:52,099
You can't just go out wandering.

621
00:43:52,233 --> 00:43:54,001
Anything could happen to you, okay?

622
00:43:54,135 --> 00:43:56,003
Do you understand that? What is this?

623
00:43:57,738 --> 00:44:00,141
-We did it, Lee. -You sold your mother's house?

624
00:44:01,275 --> 00:44:03,644
$3,000?

625
00:44:03,777 --> 00:44:05,279
$3,000?

626
00:44:07,414 --> 00:44:08,816
Oh, my gosh!

627
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:13,654
I've never even seen money like this.

628
00:44:16,824 --> 00:44:18,125
Muriel...

629
00:44:30,738 --> 00:44:31,772
I know.

630
00:44:33,941 --> 00:44:36,210
I know. That house is the last piece of your ma you had left.

631
00:44:36,343 --> 00:44:37,678
I understand.

632
00:44:48,122 --> 00:44:50,891
General delivery, Las Vegas, Nevada.

633
00:44:51,025 --> 00:44:53,060
To Julius Walker.

634
00:44:55,564 --> 00:44:56,697
Dear Julius,

635
00:44:57,532 --> 00:44:59,300
been a while since I've heard back from you.

636
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,070
Suppose you must have hit it big and forgot all about us.

637
00:45:04,004 --> 00:45:06,807
As you can see, we went and bought ourselves a house.

638
00:45:08,008 --> 00:45:10,512
Included in this letter is our new address.

639
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:13,080
Come on.

640
00:45:13,214 --> 00:45:15,684
Come see us when your luck runs out.

641
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:17,117
Muriel.

642
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,914
Hello?

643
00:46:21,482 --> 00:46:24,151
Goddamn it, Julius.

644
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:27,921
Muriel. It's my brother.

645
00:46:30,257 --> 00:46:32,159
Thought she might like to know you're not dead.

646
00:46:32,727 --> 00:46:34,328
So tell me all the news, then.

647
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:36,330
Well, we finally sold the house in Kansas.

648
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,066
Got us a little place here in the Valley.

649
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:40,134
That ain't no news.

650
00:46:40,267 --> 00:46:41,502
Muriel already wrote me about it.

651
00:46:43,304 --> 00:46:44,338
She did?

652
00:46:46,675 --> 00:46:47,676
You know, I can't believe

653
00:46:47,808 --> 00:46:49,511
she let her ma's place go like that.

654
00:46:50,578 --> 00:46:52,946
You know, truth be told, I didn't know a thing about it.

655
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:57,519
She got it all done on her own as a surprise to me.

656
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,523
Hold on. I'll put Muriel on for a minute.

657
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:06,695
Hold on.

658
00:47:10,765 --> 00:47:13,367
Muriel, is that you?

659
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:17,237
Uh, it's that sad girl that needs someone

660
00:47:17,371 --> 00:47:18,673
to tell her what to do.

661
00:47:20,608 --> 00:47:23,844
Oh, come on now. You know I didn't mean nothing by that.

662
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:26,013
So why'd you say it?

663
00:47:26,815 --> 00:47:28,182
You know why.

664
00:47:29,316 --> 00:47:31,085
Don't tell me what I know.

665
00:47:31,218 --> 00:47:33,354
Say, piece of advice.

666
00:47:34,522 --> 00:47:36,890
Don't spend all that horse money in one place.

667
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:38,459
Like on a bus ticket?

668
00:47:39,661 --> 00:47:41,462
Well, I'd, uh, I'd say I miss you,

669
00:47:41,596 --> 00:47:43,964
but you probably don't believe a word I say, do you?

670
00:47:58,713 --> 00:48:00,013
Said you wrote him.

671
00:48:00,147 --> 00:48:01,415
Think he'll come?

672
00:48:06,487 --> 00:48:08,690
I don't think he ever planned to.

673
00:48:10,558 --> 00:48:12,025
My brother is, uh...

674
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,699
My brother's not what you think.

675
00:48:18,533 --> 00:48:19,900
What does that mean?

676
00:48:22,403 --> 00:48:24,304
The world Julius lives in,

677
00:48:24,438 --> 00:48:26,440
it's a different world, that's all.

678
00:48:26,574 --> 00:48:27,742
It's not like ours.

679
00:48:29,711 --> 00:48:31,078
Um...

680
00:48:32,714 --> 00:48:35,784
I-I love my brother, you know, I always will, but...

681
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:40,855
He has passions of his own.

682
00:48:42,557 --> 00:48:44,024
Do you know what I mean?

683
00:48:48,863 --> 00:48:50,665
He's just not like us.

684
00:49:40,414 --> 00:49:41,448
Partners.

685
00:49:42,249 --> 00:49:44,017
-That's a new one. -I guess it is.

686
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:45,486
Instructive.

687
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:52,894
-What's going on? -At table ten.

688
00:50:04,939 --> 00:50:06,641
Risk reward, eh?

689
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:12,947
For your diligence.

690
00:50:16,518 --> 00:50:17,719
Did you ever think of

691
00:50:17,852 --> 00:50:18,820
tipping them off,

692
00:50:18,953 --> 00:50:20,855
those blackjack players?

693
00:50:27,695 --> 00:50:28,830
I always do.

694
00:50:31,465 --> 00:50:32,734
Think of it.

695
00:50:32,867 --> 00:50:35,837
We could make even more money if we work with them.

696
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:38,907
Yeah, don't shit where you eat's what I think.

697
00:50:41,609 --> 00:50:44,378
But maybe a place where you can take another man's money

698
00:50:44,512 --> 00:50:46,380
and get rich doing it,

699
00:50:46,514 --> 00:50:51,051
catch cheats, and watch a bomb go off all in the same day

700
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:54,756
is exactly the kind of place where the lines get blurred.

701
00:50:54,889 --> 00:50:57,592
If you're saying there ain't no difference between cheating

702
00:50:57,725 --> 00:50:59,561
and not, I'd say you're crazy.

703
00:51:03,163 --> 00:51:04,532
You have people, though.

704
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:07,802
-Just my brother and his wife. -That's enough.

705
00:51:07,936 --> 00:51:11,338
They probably love you and wonder where you are.

706
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,708
I don't see your point, friend.

707
00:51:14,308 --> 00:51:15,743
All I'm saying is, they know you.

708
00:51:15,877 --> 00:51:17,277
They don't know a thing about me.

709
00:51:17,411 --> 00:51:19,914
They know more about you than anyone knows about me.

710
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:22,951
I've been dead a hundred years, my friend.

711
00:51:24,052 --> 00:51:25,053
You can ask my father.

712
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:27,220
Well, ain't that just too bad for you?

713
00:51:27,354 --> 00:51:29,657
-It is. It is too bad for me. -Henry.

714
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:32,961
You saw what they did to those boys back there.

715
00:51:33,928 --> 00:51:36,430
I mean, we got a good thing going here. Why fuck it up?

716
00:51:36,564 --> 00:51:37,932
You ain't never seen good.

717
00:51:38,866 --> 00:51:40,434
You think this is it?

718
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,776
So you're just leaving now?

719
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:50,578
We had a great time, right?

720
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,882
Yeah.

721
00:51:55,016 --> 00:51:56,618
Yeah. Yeah. We always do.

722
00:51:57,518 --> 00:52:00,755
All you can ask for, I guess.

723
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:02,924
Right?

724
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:10,965
See you at work.

725
00:52:16,303 --> 00:52:19,073
Some asshole will always say, "Well, at least

726
00:52:19,206 --> 00:52:20,440
he took pills so he didn't suffer."

727
00:52:20,575 --> 00:52:23,276
And I'd say, "Then you didn't know Gerald."

728
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:25,813
Because if ever there was a sufferer, it was him.

729
00:52:27,214 --> 00:52:30,051
Cops putting his picture in the paper like that.

730
00:52:30,952 --> 00:52:33,487
Jesus, no wonder he offed himself.

731
00:52:33,621 --> 00:52:35,489
"Lewd behavior"?

732
00:52:35,623 --> 00:52:37,659
Why did the cops actually pick him up?

733
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:39,326
Caught him in the bathroom at the Chester

734
00:52:39,459 --> 00:52:41,562
-with another guy. -The Chester?

735
00:52:41,696 --> 00:52:44,364
Yeah, the queer bar down by the docks.

736
00:52:44,832 --> 00:52:46,500
I wonder what'll happen to that place,

737
00:52:46,634 --> 00:52:47,735
you think?

738
00:52:47,869 --> 00:52:49,637
Ain't the first time it's been raided.

739
00:52:49,771 --> 00:52:50,972
Won't be the last.

740
00:52:52,507 --> 00:52:54,542
Think all those pretty boys ran out into the sea?

741
00:52:57,779 --> 00:52:58,946
You see that?

742
00:53:47,294 --> 00:53:50,397
-Where's the other guy? -You got me, bud.

743
00:53:55,002 --> 00:53:56,236
Dear Muriel,

744
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:58,271
I saw a girl on the floor the other day

745
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:00,041
who looked just like you.

746
00:54:00,474 --> 00:54:03,410
But then she smiled back at me and I knew it couldn't be you.

747
00:54:04,912 --> 00:54:07,414
Most days I think I made the right choice coming here,

748
00:54:07,548 --> 00:54:10,752
and some days I just don't know anything at all.

749
00:54:14,956 --> 00:54:18,559
It's like they say, everybody's got an angle in this town.

750
00:54:18,693 --> 00:54:20,128
Here you go.

751
00:54:23,831 --> 00:54:26,534
I guess you just got to play the cards as they come.

752
00:54:27,535 --> 00:54:29,604
But you and Lee really have it all.

753
00:54:29,737 --> 00:54:31,304
Just like you planned.

754
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:35,009
Sure hope some of your luck rubs off on me.

755
00:54:36,944 --> 00:54:38,846
Forgive me someday if you can.

756
00:54:39,547 --> 00:54:40,581
Julius.

757
00:54:41,381 --> 00:54:43,450
...what you want to hear, but I don't think other folks

758
00:54:43,584 --> 00:54:44,952
are going to feel any different.

759
00:54:45,086 --> 00:54:47,655
-Oh, hi. -Hi.

760
00:54:47,789 --> 00:54:50,224
I was just telling your husband I'm collecting signatures.

761
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:51,559
-Signatures? -Yeah.

762
00:54:51,692 --> 00:54:53,094
County's enforcing eminent domain, and they want

763
00:54:53,227 --> 00:54:55,596
to build a highway extension right through my family's land.

764
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:56,931
Highway coming this way

765
00:54:57,064 --> 00:54:58,733
seems like a good thing for everyone, don't it?

766
00:54:59,267 --> 00:55:01,235
That house has been in my family for 60 years.

767
00:55:01,368 --> 00:55:03,805
Right, but they'll give you a fair price for it.

768
00:55:03,938 --> 00:55:06,040
It's her family's home, Lee.

769
00:55:06,439 --> 00:55:09,043
Well, you sold off your mom's old homestead, didn't you?

770
00:55:09,177 --> 00:55:10,511
Well, yeah, but that's different.

771
00:55:10,645 --> 00:55:11,979
Because you were looking toward the future.

772
00:55:12,113 --> 00:55:13,446
It's the same thing here.

773
00:55:14,447 --> 00:55:16,017
I'll leave you to your breakfast.

774
00:55:25,293 --> 00:55:26,326
Hey.

775
00:55:27,595 --> 00:55:28,996
Hey, Sandra.

776
00:55:30,765 --> 00:55:33,801
I'll sign. I mean, I-I want to.

777
00:55:34,602 --> 00:55:35,903
Are you the property owner?

778
00:55:36,037 --> 00:55:37,672
Well, yes, partly.

779
00:55:37,805 --> 00:55:39,040
So the house is under your name?

780
00:55:39,807 --> 00:55:41,242
My husband's name, but, um...

781
00:55:41,374 --> 00:55:42,677
You're not the primary property owner.

782
00:55:43,211 --> 00:55:44,679
That's all they'll accept.

783
00:55:47,515 --> 00:55:49,750
Hey. Um...

784
00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:54,555
What was it? What you were playing the other day

785
00:55:54,689 --> 00:55:56,190
if it's not a guitar?

786
00:55:58,926 --> 00:56:00,294
A bandurria.

787
00:56:00,427 --> 00:56:03,798
Oh, bandurria? Is that Spanish?

788
00:56:04,999 --> 00:56:07,168
-Mm-hmm. -Oh.

789
00:56:08,803 --> 00:56:10,338
Well, I like it.

790
00:56:14,542 --> 00:56:16,577
I got eggs back if you need 'em.

791
00:56:36,197 --> 00:56:37,331
Where you been?

792
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:39,367
Call in sick.

793
00:56:39,499 --> 00:56:41,235
Got myself on a lucky streak.

794
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:45,740
Worried about me, huh?

795
00:56:46,406 --> 00:56:48,576
No, it's just a lot of cash to carry.

796
00:56:52,412 --> 00:56:54,414
I can take care of myself.

797
00:56:54,548 --> 00:56:55,616
Hmm?

798
00:57:01,722 --> 00:57:03,791
Did you get that in a cereal box?

799
00:57:03,925 --> 00:57:07,528
Hey, I won it in a game of pitch in Tijuana.

800
00:57:07,662 --> 00:57:09,397
Never go anywhere without it.

801
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,635
Why are you pulling this shit, man?

802
00:57:15,703 --> 00:57:17,772
Now, you ain't got to play partners with nobody.

803
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,473
You got me right here. You know that.

804
00:57:20,608 --> 00:57:24,078
I got you here in this room but nowhere else.

805
00:57:27,248 --> 00:57:28,950
So, what, I go out and cheat with you,

806
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:31,986
or that's it, we just... we're done?

807
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:33,754
You don't get it.

808
00:57:33,888 --> 00:57:36,390
Me and you, this is the one thing we can do

809
00:57:36,524 --> 00:57:38,659
out there in the world together.

810
00:57:39,459 --> 00:57:40,828
Right in front of them.

811
00:57:41,896 --> 00:57:43,764
No, we can do something else. We can change.

812
00:57:43,898 --> 00:57:45,833
No, you can change.

813
00:57:46,634 --> 00:57:48,202
You think we're the same?

814
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:51,105
Look at you.

815
00:57:51,238 --> 00:57:52,273
Look at me.

816
00:57:53,107 --> 00:57:56,744
People like me, we want something, we got to take it.

817
00:57:56,877 --> 00:57:58,145
There's no other way.

818
00:58:09,724 --> 00:58:11,525
If we do this, we do it smart.

819
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:13,928
Okay, we play outside town.

820
00:58:14,662 --> 00:58:16,063
Play it quiet, small rooms,

821
00:58:16,197 --> 00:58:18,032
nobody knows us, private games. That's it.

822
00:58:21,302 --> 00:58:23,137
You don't have to do nothing...

823
00:58:24,705 --> 00:58:25,973
But win.

824
00:58:27,141 --> 00:58:28,676
Hmm?

825
00:58:28,809 --> 00:58:29,777
-Stop. -Nada.

826
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:30,845
Go.

827
00:58:30,978 --> 00:58:32,380
Nada.

828
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:25,032
Bang-bang-bang.

829
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:03,304
This all feels like a dream.

830
01:00:04,004 --> 01:00:05,139
Hmm?

831
01:00:07,041 --> 01:00:08,375
It could be it is.

832
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:14,748
Dear Julius,

833
01:00:14,882 --> 01:00:17,351
the houses around us are going up fast.

834
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:20,287
Soon we'll be completely surrounded.

835
01:00:20,421 --> 01:00:23,190
I'm gonna take 50 cents out of the can for lunch.

836
01:00:24,658 --> 01:00:26,293
Big day off, huh?

837
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,795
What you gonna do?

838
01:00:28,429 --> 01:00:30,831
To be honest, I can't see you here.

839
01:00:31,866 --> 01:00:33,434
You wouldn't be able to breathe.

840
01:00:34,536 --> 01:00:37,138
Lee says you have wanderlust and you'll come back.

841
01:00:37,271 --> 01:00:38,607
See you.

842
01:00:38,739 --> 01:00:40,774
But I'm letting go of the plans we made.

843
01:00:40,908 --> 01:00:42,076
Bye.

844
01:00:44,812 --> 01:00:47,516
I hope you're happy, wherever you are.

845
01:00:49,183 --> 01:00:50,217
Muriel.

846
01:02:01,255 --> 01:02:02,423
A stinger, please.

847
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:13,867
Such a funny story.

848
01:02:16,337 --> 01:02:17,672
I'll be back.

849
01:02:22,109 --> 01:02:23,545
I bet you don't remember me.

850
01:02:26,581 --> 01:02:27,616
How much?

851
01:02:28,717 --> 01:02:30,150
So how's your luck these days?

852
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,753
Gave all that up.

853
01:02:33,454 --> 01:02:34,955
Just like that?

854
01:02:35,724 --> 01:02:37,258
Made a promise to myself.

855
01:02:38,392 --> 01:02:40,695
What sort of promise?

856
01:02:41,862 --> 01:02:43,130
If you think too much about luck,

857
01:02:43,264 --> 01:02:45,734
it starts to own you, doesn't it?

858
01:02:47,201 --> 01:02:48,936
We're all owned by something.

859
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:51,105
Or someone.

860
01:02:54,743 --> 01:02:55,677
I'm Gail.

861
01:02:55,809 --> 01:02:57,344
Oh, uh...

862
01:02:57,478 --> 01:02:58,912
I'm Linda.

863
01:03:00,047 --> 01:03:02,149
Nice to meet you, Linda.

864
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:09,758
You hear the news?

865
01:03:10,291 --> 01:03:12,192
That poor Russian dog died.

866
01:03:12,326 --> 01:03:14,094
The one they shot into space.

867
01:03:14,228 --> 01:03:15,563
Sad.

868
01:03:15,697 --> 01:03:17,431
You know they ran odds on it?

869
01:03:17,565 --> 01:03:19,933
Twenty to one he'd make it into orbit.

870
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:22,403
Hundred to one he'd come back down.

871
01:03:23,437 --> 01:03:24,773
What about dying?

872
01:03:24,905 --> 01:03:26,874
Nobody wanted to pay out that bet.

873
01:03:28,075 --> 01:03:30,679
These days, people will bet on just about anything.

874
01:03:33,314 --> 01:03:34,948
Endless possibilities.

875
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,954
Endless.

876
01:03:43,223 --> 01:03:44,425
Funny.

877
01:03:47,328 --> 01:03:48,630
I never meet anyone.

878
01:03:51,899 --> 01:03:53,300
Everybody quiet.

879
01:03:54,669 --> 01:03:56,036
The cops are outside.

880
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,404
Open up, open up!

881
01:03:57,539 --> 01:03:58,707
Come in.

882
01:03:58,839 --> 01:04:00,575
Uh, what can I do for you, Officer?

883
01:04:00,709 --> 01:04:01,676
What's going on upstairs?

884
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:02,811
Uh, nothing, nothing.

885
01:04:02,943 --> 01:04:04,912
Uh, I do have this envelope here for...

886
01:04:07,682 --> 01:04:08,683
Thank you, Officer.

887
01:04:10,918 --> 01:04:13,020
Coast is clear.

888
01:04:16,423 --> 01:04:18,459
I can't stay out any later tonight.

889
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,228
Uh, me neither.

890
01:04:23,097 --> 01:04:24,666
You're new at this, aren't you?

891
01:04:25,299 --> 01:04:27,301
It's all luck, really.

892
01:04:27,702 --> 01:04:29,036
You'll see.

893
01:04:29,169 --> 01:04:32,373
We're all just a hair's breadth from losing everything.

894
01:04:33,974 --> 01:04:35,275
All the time.

895
01:05:16,417 --> 01:05:17,685
Oh.

896
01:05:18,686 --> 01:05:19,920
Oh, yes.

897
01:05:20,421 --> 01:05:21,388
I...

898
01:05:21,523 --> 01:05:23,924
I'm looking for Sandra.

899
01:05:24,057 --> 01:05:25,627
Are you here for a book club?

900
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,662
Password is your favorite author.

901
01:05:27,796 --> 01:05:30,464
I'm sensing Willa Cather maybe.

902
01:05:30,598 --> 01:05:32,132
Oh.

903
01:05:32,266 --> 01:05:33,601
Oh, we're really big readers here.

904
01:05:33,735 --> 01:05:35,469
Jesus.

905
01:05:35,603 --> 01:05:36,571
-Move. -What?

906
01:05:36,704 --> 01:05:37,772
Come on.

907
01:05:44,244 --> 01:05:45,613
You're not wearing any shoes.

908
01:06:00,829 --> 01:06:02,429
Over here, Mrs. Walker.

909
01:06:10,905 --> 01:06:12,841
I wanted it to be quiet.

910
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:14,074
What?

911
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:17,779
I want it to be quiet.

912
01:06:23,952 --> 01:06:25,620
Like that?

913
01:06:30,658 --> 01:06:32,359
Something cool...

914
01:06:32,493 --> 01:06:33,994
This is what it's like?

915
01:06:35,462 --> 01:06:36,531
What?

916
01:06:38,131 --> 01:06:39,166
Your life.

917
01:06:41,201 --> 01:06:43,070
You're a little drunk, I think.

918
01:06:45,105 --> 01:06:47,040
Stop making fun of me.

919
01:06:47,174 --> 01:06:49,443
Tell me why you want it quiet.

920
01:06:50,477 --> 01:06:51,679
I don't think so.

921
01:06:54,983 --> 01:06:58,620
My, it's nice

922
01:07:00,487 --> 01:07:05,225
To simply sit and rest a while

923
01:07:09,129 --> 01:07:12,232
Now, I know it's a shame

924
01:07:12,366 --> 01:07:16,004
I can't think of your name

925
01:07:16,136 --> 01:07:20,808
I remember your smile

926
01:07:21,809 --> 01:07:25,513
I don't ordinarily drink

927
01:07:25,647 --> 01:07:27,015
With strangers

928
01:07:29,617 --> 01:07:34,254
I most usually drink alone...

929
01:07:45,265 --> 01:07:47,134
I wasn't sure about you.

930
01:07:49,003 --> 01:07:50,838
Are you sure about me now?

931
01:07:50,972 --> 01:07:53,007
I'm not.

932
01:07:54,742 --> 01:07:58,012
You're really not afraid of being alone, are you?

933
01:07:59,047 --> 01:08:00,347
Neither are you.

934
01:08:02,316 --> 01:08:03,751
What makes you say that?

935
01:08:05,118 --> 01:08:06,921
Because you're here.

936
01:08:07,055 --> 01:08:10,925
It's just right for the heat

937
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:13,995
Save my furs for the cold...

938
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,401
Come. Come with me.

939
01:08:21,536 --> 01:08:25,039
Well, I don't smoke them

940
01:08:25,172 --> 01:08:27,542
As a rule...

941
01:08:29,409 --> 01:08:34,048
Who would beg and beg to take me to the ball

942
01:08:34,181 --> 01:08:36,651
And I'll bet you couldn't picture me

943
01:08:40,555 --> 01:08:42,523
The time I went to Paris

944
01:08:42,657 --> 01:08:44,157
In the fall

945
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:49,363
And who would think

946
01:08:49,496 --> 01:08:52,800
The man I loved

947
01:08:52,934 --> 01:08:57,137
Was quite so handsome

948
01:08:57,270 --> 01:09:01,709
Quite so charmed?

949
01:09:01,843 --> 01:09:03,544
I hope you come back.

950
01:09:04,579 --> 01:09:09,083
Well, it's through

951
01:09:10,384 --> 01:09:13,453
It's just a memory I had

952
01:09:13,588 --> 01:09:14,856
Okay, well...

953
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:18,026
G-Good night.

954
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:22,764
One I almost forgot

955
01:09:22,897 --> 01:09:24,364
'Cause the weather...

956
01:09:26,134 --> 01:09:27,234
The Rifleman.

957
01:09:27,367 --> 01:09:30,872
If we ever hit it big, where would you go?

958
01:09:31,304 --> 01:09:33,206
Man, I've never really thought about it.

959
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:35,375
Always got to have yourself an exit plan.

960
01:09:36,577 --> 01:09:38,211
Probably San Diego for you.

961
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:39,881
Got your brother there and all, right?

962
01:09:40,882 --> 01:09:42,717
Easier time down in Mexico.

963
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:45,218
Big money with the sailors and the husbands

964
01:09:45,352 --> 01:09:46,621
down from California.

965
01:09:47,354 --> 01:09:48,756
They're always married.

966
01:09:52,894 --> 01:09:54,095
Anyway,

967
01:09:54,227 --> 01:09:57,431
why buy yourself a plain old house in San Diego

968
01:09:57,565 --> 01:09:59,701
when you can build a palace in Tijuana?

969
01:09:59,834 --> 01:10:02,070
Yeah, well, if you ever hit it big...

970
01:10:02,837 --> 01:10:05,439
If we ever hit it big.

971
01:10:06,641 --> 01:10:09,409
-"We." -So?

972
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:12,013
I mean, I'm wide open to ideas, partner.

973
01:10:12,146 --> 01:10:13,681
-Yeah, like what? -Mm-hmm.

974
01:10:14,214 --> 01:10:17,350
Taking five bucks a day from housewives from El Paso?

975
01:10:18,485 --> 01:10:20,253
Yeah, what's your idea, then?

976
01:10:22,322 --> 01:10:23,356
Easy.

977
01:10:24,224 --> 01:10:28,029
I mean, there's no rules against us gambling there.

978
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:31,733
And our casino has the best odds in town.

979
01:10:31,866 --> 01:10:34,168
We can make a grand in ten quick deals.

980
01:10:37,705 --> 01:10:38,906
Are you insane?

981
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:42,910
You know they pay us to catch guys like us.

982
01:10:43,745 --> 01:10:45,312
I mean, the minute you sit down at that table,

983
01:10:45,445 --> 01:10:46,480
you're pinned.

984
01:10:47,515 --> 01:10:48,549
No.

985
01:10:50,118 --> 01:10:51,619
Not with you upstairs.

986
01:10:53,453 --> 01:10:54,956
Not if you don't pin me.

987
01:10:55,723 --> 01:10:57,290
When are you gonna see it?

988
01:10:59,392 --> 01:11:01,129
You know, we got it good here.

989
01:11:01,763 --> 01:11:03,097
I mean, real good.

990
01:11:05,032 --> 01:11:09,269
I've been in Kansas and L.A., and I've been in Korea.

991
01:11:11,506 --> 01:11:13,641
And in all those places, I've been a thief,

992
01:11:14,542 --> 01:11:16,144
a faggot and alone.

993
01:11:19,881 --> 01:11:21,314
And, you know, for the first time in my life,

994
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:23,416
I can finally see around the next goddamn corner.

995
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:25,086
You know why?

996
01:11:25,887 --> 01:11:27,255
Why?

997
01:11:29,524 --> 01:11:30,825
Because I'm with you.

998
01:11:36,063 --> 01:11:38,398
I mean, things are different now, aren't they?

999
01:11:39,299 --> 01:11:40,768
Well, aren't they?

1000
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:44,205
You really are something.

1001
01:11:44,337 --> 01:11:46,339
-Aren't they? -You know that, right?

1002
01:11:46,473 --> 01:11:47,542
Aren't they?

1003
01:11:52,246 --> 01:11:55,382
-Aren't they? -You know they are.

1004
01:11:55,516 --> 01:11:56,851
No?

1005
01:11:58,451 --> 01:12:00,387
I'm just gonna wear you down.

1006
01:12:01,956 --> 01:12:03,691
But you know that, right?

1007
01:12:06,661 --> 01:12:08,696
One day you'll say yes.

1008
01:12:11,498 --> 01:12:12,667
Yeah.

1009
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:15,303
Yeah, maybe I will.

1010
01:12:19,974 --> 01:12:21,175
You're crazy.

1011
01:13:05,653 --> 01:13:06,754
You okay?

1012
01:13:06,888 --> 01:13:08,089
Uh-huh.

1013
01:13:09,156 --> 01:13:10,925
-Like this? -Uh-huh.

1014
01:13:12,693 --> 01:13:13,895
Open your eyes.

1015
01:13:19,066 --> 01:13:20,500
Let me see your eyes.

1016
01:13:24,338 --> 01:13:27,108
Baby

1017
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:29,110
Hush-a-bye, my baby

1018
01:13:29,243 --> 01:13:31,612
Go to sleep on Mammy's knee

1019
01:13:32,914 --> 01:13:35,283
Rest your head upon my breast

1020
01:13:35,415 --> 01:13:38,451
In dreams again with me

1021
01:13:38,586 --> 01:13:41,088
Sandman is calling

1022
01:13:41,656 --> 01:13:43,891
Shadows are falling...

1023
01:13:47,261 --> 01:13:48,896
This is becoming a habit.

1024
01:13:50,564 --> 01:13:52,300
Yes, it is.

1025
01:13:54,268 --> 01:13:56,671
What is this music?

1026
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,608
My mother liked this kind of music.

1027
01:14:00,741 --> 01:14:01,976
-Yeah? -Mm-hmm.

1028
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:04,145
Well, not this, but like this.

1029
01:14:04,278 --> 01:14:07,281
-Anything you could dance to. -Mm, a real honky-tonker, huh?

1030
01:14:08,916 --> 01:14:11,352
Oh, yeah. She drove all those proper ladies in town crazy.

1031
01:14:11,484 --> 01:14:12,520
Do tell.

1032
01:14:13,554 --> 01:14:16,123
My, uh, my mother was the, uh,

1033
01:14:16,257 --> 01:14:19,060
first woman to own a car in Marshall County.

1034
01:14:19,193 --> 01:14:20,428
-Mm-hmm? -Mm-hmm.

1035
01:14:20,561 --> 01:14:23,264
She was the first woman to get a college degree

1036
01:14:23,931 --> 01:14:26,100
and the first woman to get a divorce.

1037
01:14:26,634 --> 01:14:29,937
All unrelated, I'm sure.

1038
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:35,242
I wish I could have met this mother of yours.

1039
01:14:46,387 --> 01:14:48,122
You ever been in love before?

1040
01:14:52,026 --> 01:14:54,362
Yes, once, up in L.A.,

1041
01:14:54,494 --> 01:14:56,831
before I moved back here to take care of my dad.

1042
01:14:58,265 --> 01:15:01,535
I think she figured I'd give up on this place once he passed,

1043
01:15:01,669 --> 01:15:05,473
but... I'm still here and she's not, so...

1044
01:15:08,009 --> 01:15:10,077
What about you? Lee?

1045
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:14,248
Yes. I-I love Lee.

1046
01:15:16,851 --> 01:15:18,753
But you're talking about someone else?

1047
01:15:21,455 --> 01:15:23,124
I don't know. It's, um...

1048
01:15:26,727 --> 01:15:28,029
It's like I...

1049
01:15:28,162 --> 01:15:31,165
saw something no one ever told me was there before.

1050
01:15:34,201 --> 01:15:36,370
Never made any sense.

1051
01:15:37,438 --> 01:15:38,739
Still doesn't.

1052
01:15:40,441 --> 01:15:42,511
Measure it all out, we spent maybe 24 hours

1053
01:15:42,643 --> 01:15:44,578
in front of each other and that's it.

1054
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:48,149
Could be that's all it takes.

1055
01:15:49,383 --> 01:15:50,584
It's strange.

1056
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,021
Like the minute he walked in the door,

1057
01:15:54,155 --> 01:15:56,223
I could breathe again.

1058
01:15:58,059 --> 01:15:59,093
He?

1059
01:16:01,929 --> 01:16:04,031
You're kind of a lot, Mrs. Walker.

1060
01:16:22,416 --> 01:16:23,884
Fuck.

1061
01:16:35,896 --> 01:16:37,264
Fuck.

1062
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:48,309
Henry.

1063
01:17:07,094 --> 01:17:08,095
No.

1064
01:17:09,797 --> 01:17:10,831
No, no, no.

1065
01:17:11,932 --> 01:17:13,300
Thirteen... black, odd.

1066
01:17:17,171 --> 01:17:18,839
Oh, no, Henry.

1067
01:17:22,443 --> 01:17:24,044
This feels like a seven.

1068
01:17:27,648 --> 01:17:30,084
Henry. Henry.

1069
01:17:31,719 --> 01:17:33,020
No, no, no, no, no.

1070
01:17:34,054 --> 01:17:35,524
No, no, no, no, no.

1071
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:41,128
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck!

1072
01:17:43,397 --> 01:17:44,633
You didn't

1073
01:17:44,765 --> 01:17:46,800
finger this greaser. Why?

1074
01:17:46,934 --> 01:17:49,604
You were working tables all around town together is why.

1075
01:17:51,071 --> 01:17:53,140
You were part of it. Ain't that right, greaser?

1076
01:18:01,315 --> 01:18:02,584
No.

1077
01:18:03,184 --> 01:18:05,386
I don't work with no dickless pansy boys.

1078
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:09,256
Look at him, fucking shaking.

1079
01:18:10,191 --> 01:18:12,594
Go. Go, cabrón.

1080
01:18:15,496 --> 01:18:17,831
Is that right, Mary?

1081
01:18:17,965 --> 01:18:19,900
-Get the fuck out of here. -What are you gonna do to him?

1082
01:18:20,034 --> 01:18:22,036
-Get out of here. -Henry!

1083
01:19:56,063 --> 01:19:59,133
Well, I'll be damned.

1084
01:20:02,002 --> 01:20:04,838
Hey!

1085
01:20:08,175 --> 01:20:10,210
Well, I'll be damned, Julius.

1086
01:20:11,245 --> 01:20:13,682
Would you look at that?

1087
01:20:13,814 --> 01:20:15,617
You really did it, didn't you?

1088
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:18,687
That garden's coming in nice.

1089
01:20:18,819 --> 01:20:20,321
Jesus Christ.

1090
01:20:22,323 --> 01:20:25,192
Not even a postcard? Tell us you're coming?

1091
01:20:25,326 --> 01:20:26,293
Yeah, well, you can always

1092
01:20:26,427 --> 01:20:27,696
count on me for a surprise.

1093
01:20:27,828 --> 01:20:29,296
That a horse trailer?

1094
01:20:30,364 --> 01:20:32,701
You, uh, win a bet or lose a bet?

1095
01:20:32,833 --> 01:20:34,301
Since when are you the kind of people

1096
01:20:34,435 --> 01:20:36,103
who couldn't make use of a horse?

1097
01:20:38,005 --> 01:20:39,373
Hello.

1098
01:20:48,683 --> 01:20:50,484
Mm-hmm.

1099
01:20:52,252 --> 01:20:54,121
I thought y'all said you had a ranch.

1100
01:20:54,254 --> 01:20:56,123
It's a goddamn ranch house, Julius.

1101
01:20:57,692 --> 01:20:59,561
Well, I guess we're real Westerners now.

1102
01:21:00,695 --> 01:21:02,831
Come on, get in here.

1103
01:21:05,466 --> 01:21:07,602
Where the hell did you get that animal from?

1104
01:21:07,736 --> 01:21:09,436
Lee, a fella wants to bet his horse,

1105
01:21:09,571 --> 01:21:10,871
I'll take his horse.

1106
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:15,275
Hey.

1107
01:21:23,884 --> 01:21:25,219
Got two bedrooms.

1108
01:21:26,353 --> 01:21:27,622
That one's all yours.

1109
01:21:28,489 --> 01:21:30,023
Figure this is a nursery.

1110
01:21:30,558 --> 01:21:32,092
We're still getting settled.

1111
01:21:32,226 --> 01:21:35,129
Muriel's been working doubles at the café.

1112
01:21:35,262 --> 01:21:37,866
I've been picking up extra shifts whenever I can get 'em.

1113
01:21:39,233 --> 01:21:42,069
And, uh, this is ours.

1114
01:21:42,903 --> 01:21:45,072
-It's cozy. -Mm-hmm.

1115
01:21:57,552 --> 01:22:00,053
Everything's looking real prosperous around here.

1116
01:22:02,256 --> 01:22:04,526
Come on, I'll show you out back.

1117
01:22:18,071 --> 01:22:20,073
Builders here took just eight weeks.

1118
01:22:21,576 --> 01:22:23,243
-You believe that? -Mm.

1119
01:22:26,313 --> 01:22:27,948
Remember how long we took trying to fix up

1120
01:22:28,081 --> 01:22:29,416
Uncle Jack's old place?

1121
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:31,920
Burning the furniture for heat?

1122
01:22:36,658 --> 01:22:38,726
Imagine growing up in a house like this.

1123
01:22:39,527 --> 01:22:40,762
Stand out back here some nights,

1124
01:22:40,895 --> 01:22:42,463
look at this house, and I think...

1125
01:22:43,765 --> 01:22:45,934
"There's a place that makes sense to a kid."

1126
01:22:46,066 --> 01:22:48,302
Yeah, well, we ain't kids no more.

1127
01:22:50,638 --> 01:22:52,105
I just wanted you to be here.

1128
01:22:53,541 --> 01:22:55,108
See it was possible.

1129
01:22:56,611 --> 01:22:58,613
Even for nobodies like us.

1130
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:02,115
Only I ain't like you.

1131
01:23:05,152 --> 01:23:06,487
No, we ain't the same, Lee.

1132
01:23:08,923 --> 01:23:10,457
You think I don't know that?

1133
01:23:12,594 --> 01:23:14,562
You think I don't know exactly who you are?

1134
01:23:17,998 --> 01:23:20,133
I ain't asking you to change, Julius.

1135
01:23:21,368 --> 01:23:23,036
I just want you to be safe.

1136
01:23:24,304 --> 01:23:25,573
I want to see you.

1137
01:23:27,542 --> 01:23:30,512
I want to hear your goddamn voice around this place is all.

1138
01:23:33,882 --> 01:23:35,048
Well, I'm here now.

1139
01:23:40,922 --> 01:23:44,191
I'm just a hot mama

1140
01:23:44,324 --> 01:23:46,193
I'm known by that name

1141
01:23:46,326 --> 01:23:49,463
Hot mama, hot mama

1142
01:23:49,597 --> 01:23:51,365
Hands off that heat

1143
01:23:51,498 --> 01:23:53,367
If you can't cool the flame

1144
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,703
Hot mama, hot mama

1145
01:23:55,837 --> 01:23:57,739
I'm warning all you chicks

1146
01:23:57,872 --> 01:23:59,641
Telling you what's right

1147
01:23:59,774 --> 01:24:01,509
Hot mama, hot mama

1148
01:24:01,643 --> 01:24:05,212
Yeah, I'm warning all you chicks

1149
01:24:05,345 --> 01:24:07,180
Telling you what's right

1150
01:24:07,314 --> 01:24:09,416
Hot mama, hot mama

1151
01:24:09,551 --> 01:24:11,953
If you wanna keep your man...

1152
01:24:12,085 --> 01:24:13,253
Muriel.

1153
01:24:14,756 --> 01:24:16,524
-Muriel. -We're going out,

1154
01:24:16,658 --> 01:24:17,592
-Muriel. -Grab a jacket.

1155
01:24:17,725 --> 01:24:19,059
Come on. Come on.

1156
01:24:21,461 --> 01:24:22,597
Horse?

1157
01:24:24,197 --> 01:24:25,432
Horse!

1158
01:24:25,567 --> 01:24:27,434
Suppose you'll have to catch him first.

1159
01:24:27,569 --> 01:24:29,202
See, Lee, even your wife thinks that horse

1160
01:24:29,336 --> 01:24:30,572
has got too much blood.

1161
01:24:30,705 --> 01:24:32,040
Yeah, yeah.

1162
01:24:35,075 --> 01:24:37,645
Oh! He's making a run for it.

1163
01:24:37,779 --> 01:24:39,413
Come on now. Get out the posse!

1164
01:24:39,547 --> 01:24:40,682
Yeehaw!

1165
01:24:40,815 --> 01:24:43,017
Whoo!

1166
01:24:50,925 --> 01:24:51,960
So this is, uh,

1167
01:24:52,994 --> 01:24:54,596
this is paradise, huh?

1168
01:24:55,663 --> 01:24:57,599
Something like that.

1169
01:25:03,705 --> 01:25:06,040
It must have been hard letting your mom's place go.

1170
01:25:07,407 --> 01:25:08,475
It was.

1171
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:18,019
You swore you were coming.

1172
01:25:19,787 --> 01:25:21,022
Forgive me?

1173
01:25:26,928 --> 01:25:28,830
-I wish... -Yeah?

1174
01:25:31,298 --> 01:25:33,034
I wish you came before.

1175
01:25:34,669 --> 01:25:36,004
Earlier.

1176
01:25:37,137 --> 01:25:40,508
Yeah, I wish all kinds of different things all day long.

1177
01:25:41,576 --> 01:25:42,710
Like what?

1178
01:25:45,079 --> 01:25:46,614
Can I show you something?

1179
01:25:50,484 --> 01:25:51,619
That real?

1180
01:25:52,219 --> 01:25:54,488
This gun belongs to a man named Henry.

1181
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:56,824
And, uh...

1182
01:25:57,992 --> 01:25:59,192
Henry would say it doesn't matter

1183
01:25:59,326 --> 01:26:01,129
whether the thing's real or not.

1184
01:26:02,462 --> 01:26:04,866
What matters is that people think it's real.

1185
01:26:05,933 --> 01:26:08,603
It-it belongs to a man named Henry?

1186
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:13,007
You remember once I asked you about love?

1187
01:26:13,141 --> 01:26:16,010
I didn't know anything about anything.

1188
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:20,247
I'm not sure I know too much more now, but...

1189
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:27,588
I am sure that this is Henry's gun.

1190
01:26:31,993 --> 01:26:33,027
And, um...

1191
01:26:34,062 --> 01:26:35,530
I'm gonna get it back to him.

1192
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:41,569
I'm gonna find him.

1193
01:26:43,503 --> 01:26:45,305
Uh, I don't understand.

1194
01:26:47,008 --> 01:26:48,876
I think you probably do.

1195
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:54,148
Probably.

1196
01:26:57,384 --> 01:26:58,586
I don't.

1197
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:10,531
Sometimes...

1198
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:16,336
someone comes into your life, and, um...

1199
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:20,208
Nothing's ever the same again.

1200
01:27:26,714 --> 01:27:28,415
I need to borrow some money.

1201
01:27:30,184 --> 01:27:31,485
What?

1202
01:27:32,252 --> 01:27:34,122
I need money to find him.

1203
01:27:37,225 --> 01:27:38,258
That's why you're here.

1204
01:27:41,829 --> 01:27:43,330
That's why you came.

1205
01:27:44,899 --> 01:27:46,299
To borrow money.

1206
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:55,977
Stop. Stop touching me.

1207
01:27:59,947 --> 01:28:01,716
You were never gonna stay.

1208
01:28:05,052 --> 01:28:06,319
Lee was right about you.

1209
01:28:07,688 --> 01:28:09,056
What's that supposed to mean?

1210
01:28:10,124 --> 01:28:11,391
You're a coward.

1211
01:28:12,727 --> 01:28:13,928
And you're a liar.

1212
01:28:16,396 --> 01:28:19,934
Take your damn pit pony and go.

1213
01:28:25,173 --> 01:28:26,707
Hey, Kansas.

1214
01:28:28,509 --> 01:28:31,145
You got your secrets and I got mine!

1215
01:29:11,752 --> 01:29:13,054
Julius.

1216
01:29:40,248 --> 01:29:41,716
It's just a dream.

1217
01:29:44,484 --> 01:29:45,887
Go back to sleep.

1218
01:30:30,197 --> 01:30:31,666
He couldn't go far.

1219
01:30:31,799 --> 01:30:33,067
Truck of his is about ready for the...

1220
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,002
We aren't gonna find Julius, Muriel.

1221
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:36,570
Not until the money's all gone.

1222
01:30:36,704 --> 01:30:38,239
We'll find a way, Lee.

1223
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:34,588
Oh. P-Para. Para.

1224
01:32:34,722 --> 01:32:36,290
Stop. Stop.

1225
01:32:43,197 --> 01:32:45,433
Henry!

1226
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:47,134
Henry.

1227
01:32:51,038 --> 01:32:52,306
I'm sorry.

1228
01:32:53,508 --> 01:32:54,543
Sorry.

1229
01:33:25,574 --> 01:33:27,741
You're a real suave dancer, Mrs. Walker.

1230
01:33:30,111 --> 01:33:31,779
Hey, when's your husband due home?

1231
01:33:31,912 --> 01:33:33,080
He's working late.

1232
01:33:33,614 --> 01:33:35,316
We've got hours and hours and hours.

1233
01:33:35,449 --> 01:33:36,784
-Oh, yeah? -Mm-hmm.

1234
01:33:36,917 --> 01:33:39,787
Besides, he knows I would never do something like this.

1235
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,789
Well, I love you, baby...

1236
01:33:41,922 --> 01:33:43,491
Like this?

1237
01:33:44,559 --> 01:33:45,793
You know what I mean.

1238
01:33:45,926 --> 01:33:47,428
Love me, baby, hold me tight...

1239
01:33:47,562 --> 01:33:48,796
Like me?

1240
01:33:48,929 --> 01:33:50,030
With all your might

1241
01:33:50,164 --> 01:33:51,298
Bam-a-lam

1242
01:33:52,433 --> 01:33:53,868
Bam-a-lam

1243
01:33:55,236 --> 01:33:57,371
Well...

1244
01:33:57,505 --> 01:33:59,173
Oh, come on. I love that song.

1245
01:34:04,111 --> 01:34:05,346
What are you doing?

1246
01:34:06,247 --> 01:34:07,314
What?

1247
01:34:07,448 --> 01:34:08,449
I'm real.

1248
01:34:08,583 --> 01:34:09,850
This is real.

1249
01:34:10,885 --> 01:34:13,087
God, Lee is real.

1250
01:34:14,255 --> 01:34:15,689
You get that, right?

1251
01:34:18,092 --> 01:34:19,693
I know that.

1252
01:34:22,663 --> 01:34:24,165
-Do you? -Stop.

1253
01:34:24,298 --> 01:34:27,201
Sandra, come on. We're ju... we're just having fun.

1254
01:34:27,334 --> 01:34:28,936
Oh, I get it. You're just having fun.

1255
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:32,173
-You're on vacation. -What are you talking about?

1256
01:34:34,175 --> 01:34:36,343
You go home every night where it's warm and safe,

1257
01:34:36,477 --> 01:34:38,379
and you go fuck your husband to feel normal.

1258
01:34:38,513 --> 01:34:40,214
And then you come over here and you fuck me

1259
01:34:40,347 --> 01:34:42,082
to feel alive, and then you do it all over again.

1260
01:34:42,683 --> 01:34:46,153
You knew exactly who I was when you let me in here, okay?

1261
01:34:46,287 --> 01:34:47,688
You knew my situation.

1262
01:34:50,991 --> 01:34:52,193
You're too good at this.

1263
01:34:54,161 --> 01:34:55,930
-What did you expect? -If that's all this is,

1264
01:34:56,063 --> 01:34:57,364
there's a bar in town

1265
01:34:57,498 --> 01:34:58,766
-with a dozen other women... -Stop.

1266
01:34:58,899 --> 01:35:00,100
...that would cause me a lot less pain.

1267
01:35:00,234 --> 01:35:01,536
-Sandra. -Please, just go.

1268
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:05,640
Cling to me

1269
01:35:05,773 --> 01:35:09,310
Like a fish in a deep, blue sea

1270
01:35:09,443 --> 01:35:12,713
Make my heart feel toodle-oo...

1271
01:35:15,149 --> 01:35:16,183
Come on, please.

1272
01:35:17,318 --> 01:35:18,687
-Just stop. -Please don't.

1273
01:35:20,854 --> 01:35:22,022
I want you to leave.

1274
01:35:22,156 --> 01:35:23,090
I didn't,

1275
01:35:23,224 --> 01:35:25,226
I didn't mean it like that.

1276
01:35:34,368 --> 01:35:35,436
Hey.

1277
01:35:42,711 --> 01:35:43,744
Hey.

1278
01:36:36,263 --> 01:36:38,265
I thought they had you on a double today.

1279
01:36:39,266 --> 01:36:41,335
I'm too slow.

1280
01:36:41,468 --> 01:36:42,637
Couldn't use me.

1281
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:49,476
She was out of eggs, then, your friend?

1282
01:36:50,745 --> 01:36:52,446
Oh, yeah, yeah, she was out.

1283
01:36:56,350 --> 01:36:58,218
I'm not sure I realized before,

1284
01:36:59,086 --> 01:37:00,988
not for certain, I mean, but...

1285
01:37:04,659 --> 01:37:06,160
you remind me of him.

1286
01:37:08,495 --> 01:37:09,798
Julius.

1287
01:37:11,999 --> 01:37:14,935
I envy him sometimes, you know?

1288
01:37:17,004 --> 01:37:18,172
You do?

1289
01:37:18,305 --> 01:37:19,340
Yeah.

1290
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:22,176
He gets to live like there's no tomorrow.

1291
01:37:24,945 --> 01:37:26,213
You think I'm like that?

1292
01:38:07,555 --> 01:38:08,790
Lee?

1293
01:38:19,868 --> 01:38:20,934
Hey.

1294
01:38:25,005 --> 01:38:27,408
Don't... no, don't say anything.

1295
01:38:39,721 --> 01:38:41,756
I remember this girl from town.

1296
01:38:43,858 --> 01:38:45,125
She had two men.

1297
01:38:47,529 --> 01:38:49,731
One of them was a kid Julius used to run with.

1298
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:53,133
Pool hall kid.

1299
01:38:55,904 --> 01:38:58,573
The other guy was a college type none of us really knew.

1300
01:39:01,241 --> 01:39:03,578
Ran the sand mill across the river with his pop.

1301
01:39:05,647 --> 01:39:08,650
The girl... Sally, I want to say her name was...

1302
01:39:11,285 --> 01:39:14,321
Spent her afternoons with Julius and Pool Hall Kid.

1303
01:39:16,891 --> 01:39:18,158
Went to dinner in a better dress,

1304
01:39:18,292 --> 01:39:20,762
half-tilted on Hamm's with Mr. Sand Mill.

1305
01:39:21,930 --> 01:39:23,297
Pool Hall knew all about it.

1306
01:39:26,568 --> 01:39:28,001
Never bothered him, 'cause she always used to

1307
01:39:28,135 --> 01:39:29,938
come home to him at the end of the night.

1308
01:39:31,539 --> 01:39:33,575
Baffled me when Julius told me about it.

1309
01:39:38,378 --> 01:39:39,781
Six months later...

1310
01:39:41,883 --> 01:39:43,484
Sally sits down Pool Hall,

1311
01:39:44,985 --> 01:39:46,220
tells him it's over.

1312
01:39:46,987 --> 01:39:48,690
And a month after that...

1313
01:39:50,658 --> 01:39:52,993
there was her name in the engagement section.

1314
01:39:56,296 --> 01:39:58,065
And Julius was just outraged.

1315
01:40:03,437 --> 01:40:05,640
I think Julius hated the fact that...

1316
01:40:07,675 --> 01:40:11,178
she picked what wasn't real... honestly.

1317
01:40:14,381 --> 01:40:16,283
Bothered him to no end that...

1318
01:40:19,587 --> 01:40:22,322
She hadn't chosen what he'd thought of as love.

1319
01:40:25,994 --> 01:40:27,529
I didn't really know her, so...

1320
01:40:30,497 --> 01:40:31,699
Who am I to say?

1321
01:40:33,968 --> 01:40:35,402
But I bet Julius thinks I'm on the other side

1322
01:40:35,537 --> 01:40:36,871
of that story now.

1323
01:40:54,421 --> 01:40:55,757
I'm looking for my buddy.

1324
01:40:55,890 --> 01:40:57,424
Tall, skinny.

1325
01:40:57,559 --> 01:40:58,960
Scarred to hell on one arm.

1326
01:40:59,092 --> 01:41:01,061
Yeah, I think I seen him around.

1327
01:41:01,596 --> 01:41:03,031
Not that I knew his name.

1328
01:41:03,196 --> 01:41:04,532
Do you know where I can find him?

1329
01:41:06,668 --> 01:41:08,536
I got a pretty good idea.

1330
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:10,605
You think you can take me to him?

1331
01:41:44,371 --> 01:41:46,406
Did you ever want this?

1332
01:41:47,875 --> 01:41:49,744
Any of it, I mean?

1333
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:01,421
I'm sorry, Lee.

1334
01:42:02,155 --> 01:42:03,524
It doesn't matter.

1335
01:42:08,096 --> 01:42:09,631
You being sorry doesn't matter.

1336
01:42:13,568 --> 01:42:15,202
Not even a little bit.

1337
01:42:24,912 --> 01:42:26,814
Say, where is this place, friend?

1338
01:42:26,948 --> 01:42:28,783
TJ's a pretty small town.

1339
01:42:31,586 --> 01:42:33,021
Think I've seen him right around here.

1340
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:43,931
Muriel?

1341
01:42:59,346 --> 01:43:00,380
Lee,

1342
01:43:01,348 --> 01:43:03,316
you once told me that until we met,

1343
01:43:03,785 --> 01:43:05,218
you weren't sure there was anything good

1344
01:43:05,352 --> 01:43:06,386
left in the world.

1345
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:11,059
You're a good man.

1346
01:43:12,192 --> 01:43:13,861
Your dream is a good dream.

1347
01:43:15,129 --> 01:43:16,931
I know I've let you down,

1348
01:43:17,065 --> 01:43:18,700
and nothing can ever change that.

1349
01:43:22,469 --> 01:43:24,304
But I hope this helps you find what you want.

1350
01:43:25,338 --> 01:43:26,641
Please don't give up.

1351
01:43:27,875 --> 01:43:28,976
Muriel.

1352
01:44:01,109 --> 01:44:02,442
Okay, gringo.

1353
01:44:02,577 --> 01:44:04,311
These boys will take your money now.

1354
01:44:18,092 --> 01:44:19,326
Waiting for someone?

1355
01:44:19,927 --> 01:44:21,095
I am.

1356
01:44:22,730 --> 01:44:24,098
Someone who owes me money.

1357
01:44:34,675 --> 01:44:36,577
-You faggot! -Come on!

1358
01:44:56,531 --> 01:44:59,634
Don't smile...

1359
01:45:00,101 --> 01:45:01,434
I'm waiting for someone, too.

1360
01:45:03,470 --> 01:45:04,471
Been a while?

1361
01:45:04,605 --> 01:45:05,873
It has.

1362
01:45:06,741 --> 01:45:07,942
Same here.

1363
01:45:11,679 --> 01:45:12,780
Well?

1364
01:45:13,681 --> 01:45:15,049
What do you say?

1365
01:45:15,183 --> 01:45:16,884
Beside

1366
01:45:19,352 --> 01:45:23,390
Your lovely smile

1367
01:45:28,262 --> 01:45:30,531
Don't laugh...

1368
01:45:30,665 --> 01:45:32,033
First time getting stood up?

1369
01:45:33,568 --> 01:45:36,037
-Big part of this game. -Is it?

1370
01:45:38,338 --> 01:45:40,541
Guess it's never been easy for people like us

1371
01:45:41,642 --> 01:45:42,844
to find each other.

1372
01:45:43,778 --> 01:45:45,112
No, I guess not.

1373
01:45:48,783 --> 01:45:50,184
You think it's all your fault?

1374
01:45:52,086 --> 01:45:53,120
Maybe it is.

1375
01:45:54,689 --> 01:45:56,858
I guess when you are standing here

1376
01:45:57,291 --> 01:45:58,425
all on your own...

1377
01:46:00,127 --> 01:46:01,929
doesn't really matter who did what

1378
01:46:03,331 --> 01:46:04,364
or who hurt who.

1379
01:46:06,499 --> 01:46:07,535
Does it?

1380
01:46:10,171 --> 01:46:12,206
It's just the world getting in the way.

1381
01:46:16,210 --> 01:46:18,012
-Just the world. -Hmm.

1382
01:46:19,814 --> 01:46:20,848
Well...

1383
01:46:21,249 --> 01:46:24,919
whoever they are, they sure are missing out.

1384
01:46:26,888 --> 01:46:29,724
Tell him that for me if you see him.

1385
01:46:33,995 --> 01:46:35,363
That's a promise.

1386
01:46:36,931 --> 01:46:39,700
Nature on her knees

1387
01:46:41,135 --> 01:46:43,371
Would fall

1388
01:47:32,119 --> 01:47:33,421
Goodbye.

1389
01:48:58,039 --> 01:48:59,473
Dear Muriel,

1390
01:48:59,607 --> 01:49:00,841
I don't know where you are

1391
01:49:00,975 --> 01:49:03,411
and I don't know if I'll ever send this letter,

1392
01:49:03,778 --> 01:49:06,447
but there are so many things I want to say to you.

1393
01:49:07,815 --> 01:49:09,183
Last time we saw each other,

1394
01:49:09,316 --> 01:49:11,118
I was trying to say something about the two of us

1395
01:49:11,252 --> 01:49:12,820
I thought we already knew,

1396
01:49:13,721 --> 01:49:15,589
even if we never said it out loud.

1397
01:49:16,490 --> 01:49:18,426
Well, hell, it's Christmas Eve, ain't it?

1398
01:49:21,562 --> 01:49:23,464
I'm sorry I got it so wrong.

1399
01:49:24,065 --> 01:49:26,767
And I'm sorry for stealing from you and all the rest of it.

1400
01:49:30,604 --> 01:49:32,973
Everything turned out all right for me in the end,

1401
01:49:33,107 --> 01:49:35,076
so I don't want you worrying about me.

1402
01:49:36,410 --> 01:49:39,080
It's Christmas, and somehow I just bet you're okay.

1403
01:49:41,415 --> 01:49:43,951
Everybody deserves a chance to be happy.

1404
01:49:44,085 --> 01:49:45,853
I can just picture you saying that.

1405
01:49:47,556 --> 01:49:49,123
Everybody deserves a shot.

1406
01:49:50,825 --> 01:49:53,461
Even card sharps and liars and petty thieves.

1407
01:49:54,695 --> 01:49:56,097
Merry Christmas, Muriel.

1408
01:49:57,566 --> 01:49:58,866
Julius.

1409
01:51:29,356 --> 01:51:31,926
There's a life

1410
01:51:33,894 --> 01:51:36,931
I'm slowly recognizing

1411
01:51:38,399 --> 01:51:41,636
Just outside of trying

1412
01:51:43,037 --> 01:51:45,039
It's hard to give up trying

1413
01:51:45,172 --> 01:51:47,374
Okay. Okay.

1414
01:51:47,509 --> 01:51:50,477
Oh, but when I get there

1415
01:51:50,612 --> 01:51:51,546
If I get there

1416
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:53,047
Come on, let's go.

1417
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:57,384
-I get closer and closer -Hyah!

1418
01:51:57,519 --> 01:52:01,523
Lady Luck has done her best for me

1419
01:52:01,656 --> 01:52:06,093
Can I find whatever's left of me?

1420
01:52:08,630 --> 01:52:11,732
Hi, friend

1421
01:52:12,833 --> 01:52:15,570
Can I meet you again?

1422
01:52:17,672 --> 01:52:19,708
Time lost

1423
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:21,710
And won and lost

1424
01:52:21,842 --> 01:52:24,579
And won and then

1425
01:52:26,780 --> 01:52:31,051
I burned down the bridge of my life

1426
01:52:31,185 --> 01:52:34,154
To get to you

1427
01:52:35,923 --> 01:52:37,491
I'm a runner

1428
01:52:37,626 --> 01:52:39,393
I'm a runner, you're the lover

1429
01:52:39,527 --> 01:52:43,632
I'm running to

1430
01:52:43,797 --> 01:52:46,467
I'm a runner

1431
01:52:46,601 --> 01:52:48,703
I'm a runner, you're the lover

1432
01:52:48,836 --> 01:52:52,940
I'm running to

1433
01:52:58,513 --> 01:53:02,916
Go on and break what you've got to remake

1434
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:05,486
Don't be afraid

1435
01:53:07,454 --> 01:53:12,326
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

1436
01:53:12,459 --> 01:53:14,663
I'm not afraid

1437
01:53:16,631 --> 01:53:21,435
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid

1438
01:53:21,569 --> 01:53:25,873
I'm not afraid
