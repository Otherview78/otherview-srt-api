1
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,340
l should've known that you would
be here Professor McGonagall.

3
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,220
Are the rumors true Albus?

4
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,700
l'm afraid so professor.
The good and the bad.

5
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,180
-And the boy?
-Hagrid is bringing him.

6
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,820
Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid
with something as important as this?

7
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,740
Ah Professor l would trust Hagrid
with my life.

8
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,740
Professor Dumbledore sir.
Professor McGonagall.

9
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,820
-No problems l trust Hagrid?
-No sir.

10
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,500
Little tyke fell asleep just
as we were flying over Bristol.

11
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,780
Try not to wake him.

12
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,660
There you go.

13
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,620
Albus.Do you really think it's safe
leaving him with these people?

14
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,100
l've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.Imaginable.

15
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,300
-They really are--
-The only family he has.

16
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,900
This boy will be famous. There won't be a child
in our world who doesn't know his name.

17
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,460
Exactly.

18
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,940
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

19
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,180
Until he's ready.

20
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,660
There there Hagrid.
lt's not really goodbye after all.

21
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,020
Good luck...

22
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,180
...Harry Potter.

23
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,740
Up. Get up!

24
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,900
Now!

25
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,940
Wake up cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

26
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,420
-Here he comes the birthday boy.
-Happy birthday son.

27
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,420
Why don't you just cook the breakfast
and try not to burn anything.

28
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,580
-Yes Aunt Petunia.
-l want everything to be perfect...

29
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,740
...for my Dudley's special day!

30
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,940
-Hurry up! Bring my coffee boy.
-Yes Uncle Vernon.

31
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,260
Aren't they wonderful darling?

32
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,940
-How many are there?
-36. Counted them myself.

33
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,380
36?! But last year...last year l had 37!

34
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,600
-But some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year's.
-l don't care how big they are!

35
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,180
Oh now now now. This is what we're going to do...

36
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,740
... is that when we go out we're going to buy you two
new presents. How's that pumpkin?

37
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:43,340
lt should be a lovely day at the zoo.
l'm really looking forward to it.

38
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,460
l'm warning you now boy.

39
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,180
Any funny business any at all...

40
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,460
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

41
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,940
Get in.

42
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,540
Make it move.

43
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,900
Move!

44
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,620
-Move!
-He's asleep!

45
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,380
He's boring.

46
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,260
Sorry about him.

47
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,180
He doesn't understand
what it's like lying there day after day...

48
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,540
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

49
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,980
Can you hear me?

50
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,540
lt's just l've never talked
to a snake before.

51
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,420
Do you...?

52
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,740
I meanDo you talk to people often?

53
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,180
You're from Burma aren't you?
Was it nice there?

54
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,660
Do you miss your family?

55
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:02,260
l see. That's me as well.
l never knew my parents either.

56
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,460
Mummy Dad come here! you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

57
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,580
Thanks.

58
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,220
Anytime.

59
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,460
Snake!

60
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,260
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

61
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,660
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

62
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:07,220
Who did this? How did you get
in there? ls there a snake?

63
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:17,420
lt's all right sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

64
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,100
-What happened?
-l swear l don't know!

65
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,180
One minute the glass was there and
then it was gone it was like magic.

66
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,380
There's no such thing as magic.

67
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,530
And smile!

68
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,930
Vernon just look at him!
l can't believe it!

69
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,610
ln just a week he'll be off to Smeltings.

70
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,610
Caveat Smeltonia.
Proudest moment of my life.

71
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,930
Will l have to wear that too?

72
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,290
What? You? Go to Smeltings?

73
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,290
Don't be so stupid!
You're going to go to the state school.Where you belong.

74
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,050
This is what you'll going to be wearing
when l finish dyeing it.

75
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,610
That's Dudley's old uniform.
lt'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.

76
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,050
It'll fit you well enough.

77
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,010
Go get the post. Go!

78
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,610
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

79
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,010
-Dad look! Harry's got a letter!
-Hey give it back! lt's mine!

80
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,970
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

81
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,810
No more mail through this letterbox.

82
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,310
Have a lovely day at the office dear.

83
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,870
Shoo! Go on.

84
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,590
Fine day Sunday.

85
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,910
ln my opinion best day of the week.
Why is that Dudley?

86
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,550
-Because there's no post on Sundays?
-Right you are Harry!

87
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,510
No post on Sunday.

88
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,830
No blasted letters today! No sir.

89
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:31,390
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

90
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,670
No sir not one blasted miserable--

91
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,390
Make it stop please!

92
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,110
Stop it!

93
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,190
Mummy what's happening?

94
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,950
Give me that! Give me that letter!

95
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,350
Get off!

96
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,270
They're my letters! Let go of me!

97
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,110
That's it! We're going away!

98
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,430
Far away where they can't find us!

99
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,910
Daddy's gone mad hasn't he?

100
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,110
Make a wish Harry.

101
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,270
Who's there?

102
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,870
Sorry about that.

103
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,310
l demand that you leave at once Sir!
You are breaking and entering!

104
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,030
Dry up Dursley you great prune.

105
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,750
Mind l haven't seen you
since you was a baby Harry.

106
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,510
But you're a bit more along than l would have expected.
Particularly 'round the middle.

107
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,550
l'm not Harry.

108
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:29,110
-l am.
-Well of course you are.

109
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,470
Got something for you.

110
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:37,270
Afraid l might have sat on it at somepoint but l imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.

111
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,190
Baked it myself words and all.

112
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,790
Thank you.

113
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:54,150
lt's not every day that your young man
turns 11  now is it?

114
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,470
Excuse me who are you?

115
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:18,590
Rubeus Hagrid Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

116
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,550
-Of course you know all about Hogwarts.
-Sorry no.

117
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:28,070
No? Blimey Harry Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

118
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,710
Learnt what?

119
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,470
You're a wizard Harry.

120
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,710
-l'm a what?
-A wizard.

121
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,950
And a thumping good one l'd wager
once you're trained up little.

122
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,070
No you've made a mistake.
l mean...

123
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,310
...l can't be a wizard.

124
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,710
l mean l'm just Harry. Just Harry.

125
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,790
Well Just Harry did you ever
make anything happen?

126
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:00,670
Anything you couldn't explain
when you were angry or scared?

127
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,190
''Dear Mr. Potter
We are pleased to inform you...

128
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,670
...that you have been accepted at
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.''

129
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,830
He will not be going there! We swore when we took him in
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

130
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,270
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

131
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,550
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

132
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,470
My perfect sister being who she was.

133
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:46,670
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

134
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:51,030
''We have a witch in the family.
lsn't it wonderful?''

135
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,910
l was the only one to see her
for what she was.

136
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,870
A freak!

137
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,030
Then she met that Potter
and then she had you...

138
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:05,950
...and l knew you would be the same.
Just as strange just as abnormal.

139
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:11,190
And then if you please she went and got herself blown up!
And we got landed with you.

140
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,390
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

141
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,950
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

142
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,070
-We had to say something.
-lt's an outrage! It's a scandal!

143
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,750
He'll not be going.

144
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,270
Oh and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's
going to stop him are you?

145
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,470
Muggle?

146
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,830
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down ever since he were born.

147
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,910
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry in the world and...

148
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:46,030
..He'll be under the finest headmaster that
Hogwarts has ever seen Albus Dumbledore.

149
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:51,070
l will not pay to have some crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

150
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,790
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

151
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,070
...in front of me.

152
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:21,190
Oh um l'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

153
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,550
-Strickly speaking l'm not allowed to do magic.
-Okay.

154
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,830
Ooh We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

155
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,230
Unless you'd rather stay of course.

156
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,140
''First year's students will require
three sets of plain work robes...

157
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,180
...one wand.''

158
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,420
Essential bit of equipment Harry.

159
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,540
''One pair of dragon hide gloves.''
Hagrid Do they mean from a real dragon?

160
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,940
They don't mean a penguin do they?

161
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:16,180
-Crikey. l'd love a dragon.
-You'd like a dragon?

162
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:22,220
Vastly misunderstood beasts Harry.
Vastly misunderstood.

163
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,580
''All students must be equipped with...

164
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,700
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

165
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:40,700
...and may bring if they desire
either an owl a cat or a toad.''

166
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,540
Can we find all this in London?

167
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,140
lf you know where to go.

168
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,860
Ah Hagrid! The usual l presume?

169
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,940
No thanks Tom.

170
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,260
Just helping young Harry here

171
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,060
Bless my soul.

172
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,780
Welcome back Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

173
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,340
Doris Crockford Mr Potter.
l can't believe l'm meeting you at last.

174
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:41,060
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased l am to meet you.

175
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,820
Hello professor. l didn't see you there.

176
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:49,020
Harry This is Professor Quirrell.He will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.

177
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,660
Oh nice to meet you.

178
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,980
Fearfully fascinating subject.

179
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:59,820
Not that you need it eh Potter?

180
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,900
Yes well must be going now.
Lots to buy.

181
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,860
Goodbye.

182
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,180
-See Harry? You're famous.
-But why am l famous Hagrid?

183
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,860
All those people back there
how is it they know who l am?

184
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,860
l'm not sure l'm exactly the right person
to tell you that Harry.

185
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,620
Welcome Harry to Diagon Alley.

186
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,460
Here's where you'll get your quills and your ink.

187
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:04,660
And over there all your bits and bobs
for doing your wizardry.

188
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,740
lt's a world-class racing broom.

189
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,860
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

190
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,380
lt's the fastest model yet.

191
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,700
But Hagrid how am l to pay for all this?
l haven't any money.

192
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,260
Well there's your money Harry.
Gringotts the wizard bank.

193
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,980
Ain't no safer place not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

194
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,620
Hagrid what exactly
are these things?

195
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:19,100
They're goblins Harry. Clever as they come goblins
but not the most friendly of beasts.

196
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,260
Best stay close.

197
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,980
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

198
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,380
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

199
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,540
Oh Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

200
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,220
Ha! Here's the little devil.

201
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,300
Oh and there's something else as well.

202
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,860
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

203
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,020
lt's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

204
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,260
Very well.

205
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,300
Vault 687.

206
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,540
Lamp please.

207
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,380
Key please.

208
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,580
Didn't think your mum and dad
will leave you with nothing now did ya?

209
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,580
-Vault 713.
-What's in there Hagrid?

210
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:04,940
Can't tell you Harry.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

211
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,740
Stand back.

212
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,820
Best not to mention this to anyone Harry.

213
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,180
l still need...a wand.

214
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,780
A wand? Well you'll want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

215
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:59,620
Why don't you run along there and wait.
l just got one more thing I gotta do. Won't be long.

216
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,420
Hello?

217
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,220
Hello?

218
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,020
l wondered when
l'd be seeing you Mr. Potter.

219
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,060
lt seems only yesterday...

220
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:48,140
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

221
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,100
Here we are.

222
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,220
Give it a wave.

223
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,260
Apparently not.

224
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,900
Perhaps...

225
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,700
...this.

226
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:42,380
No no definitely not.
No matter.

227
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,260
l wonder....

228
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,740
Curious.

229
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,860
Very curious.

230
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,180
Sorry but what's curious?

231
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,220
l remember every wand
l've ever sold Mr. Potter.

232
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,180
lt so happens that the phoenix...

233
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:42,100
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand gave another feather.

234
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,580
Just one other.

235
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:50,140
lt is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

236
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:56,060
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

237
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,100
And who owned that wand?

238
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,340
We do not speak his name.

239
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,300
The wand chooses
the wizard Mr. Potter.

240
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,540
lt's not always clear why.

241
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,420
But l think it is clear...

242
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,540
...that we can expect
great things from you.

243
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,980
After all He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

244
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,900
...did great things.

245
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,140
Terrible...

246
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,860
...yes but great.

247
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,500
Harry! Harry!

248
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,260
Happy birthday.

249
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,900
You all right Harry?
You seem very quiet.

250
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:59,860
He killed my parents didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

251
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,700
You know Hagrid. l know you do.

252
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:12,140
First and understand this Harry
because it's very important:

253
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,900
Not all wizards are good.

254
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,580
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

255
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,820
...there was a one wizard who went as bad
as he can go. His name was V--

256
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,660
-His name was V--
-Maybe if you wrote it down?

257
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,740
No l can't spell it.

258
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:33,180
-All right Voldemort.
-Voldemort?

259
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,420
lt was dark times Harry. Dark times.

260
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,820
Voldemort started
to gather some followers.

261
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,420
Brought them over to the Dark Side.

262
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,940
Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.

263
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,100
Your parents fought against him.

264
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:01,100
But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.

265
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,060
Nobody not one.

266
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,660
Except you.

267
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:16,780
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

268
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,420
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead Harry.

269
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:27,460
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse and an evil curse at that.

270
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,300
What happened to V--?
To You-Know-Who?

271
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,780
Well some say he died.

272
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,420
Codswallop in my opinion.

273
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,900
Nope l reckon he's out there still...

274
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,060
...too tired to carry on.

275
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:50,700
But one thing's absolutely certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

276
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,180
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

277
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:59,340
You're the boy who lived.

278
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,380
What are you looking at?

279
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,140
Blimey is that the time?

280
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,340
Sorry Harry l'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his--

281
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:24,420
Well he'll be wanting to see me.
Now uh your train leaves in 10 minutes.

282
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:29,980
Here's your ticket. Stick to it Harry
that's very important. Stick to your ticket.

283
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,100
''Platform 9¾''?

284
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:40,100
But Hagrid there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9¾.

285
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,660
There's no such thing is there?

286
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,780
Sorry.

287
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:08,020
Excuse me. Excuse me.

288
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,780
Right on your left Madam.

289
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,820
Excuse me Sir Can you tell me where
l might find platform 9¾?

290
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,580
9¾? Think you're being funny do ya?

291
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,100
lt's the same every year
packed with Muggles Of course. Come on!

292
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,940
-Muggles?
-Platform 9¾ this way.

293
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,780
All right Percy you first.

294
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,980
Fred you next.

295
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,900
-He's not Fred l am.
-Honestly woman You call yourself our mother?

296
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,060
Oh l'm sorry George.

297
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,620
l'm only joking. l am Fred.

298
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,980
Excuse me.

299
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,860
Could you tell me how to...?

300
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,620
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry dear.

301
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,300
lt's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

302
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:21,420
All you've got do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

303
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,100
-Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
-Good luck.

304
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,940
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

305
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,380
Not at all.

306
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,860
l'm Ron by the way.
Ron Weasley.

307
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,740
l'm Harry. Harry Potter.

308
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,180
So it's true!

309
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,180
l mean do you really have the...?

310
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,620
-The what?
-The scar?

311
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,020
Wicked!

312
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:00,660
-Anything off the trolley dears?
-No thanks. l'm all set.

313
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,980
We'll take the lot.

314
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,500
-Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
-They mean every flavor.

315
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,300
There's chocolate
and peppermint and there's also...

316
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,340
...spinach liver and tripe.

317
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:34,740
George sweared he got
a bogey-flavoured one once!

318
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:44,740
-These aren't real frogs are they?
-lt's just a spell. Besides It's the cards you want.

319
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:50,420
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. l've got about 500 meself.

320
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,220
Watch it!

321
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,100
Oh that's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them to begin with.

322
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,780
-l've got Dumbledore!
-l got about six of him.

323
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,100
Hey he's gone!

324
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,780
Well you can't expect him to
hang around all day can you?

325
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:17,500
This is Scabbers by the way.
Pathetic isn't he?

326
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,900
Just a little bit.

327
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,420
Fred gave me a spell as
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

328
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,700
Yeah.

329
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,060
Has anyone seen a toad?

330
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,100
-A boy named Neville's lost one.
-No.

331
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:41,020
Oh are you doing magic?
Let's see then.

332
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,420
Sunshine daisies butter mellow

333
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,740
Turn this stupid fat rat yellow

334
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:58,140
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well it's not very good is it?

335
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,620
Of course l've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

336
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,420
...but they've all worked for me.

337
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,100
For example:

338
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,260
Oculus Reparo.

339
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,980
That's better isn't it?

340
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:23,060
Holy cricket you're Harry Potter!

341
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,860
l'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

342
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,780
-l'm Ron Weasley.
-Pleasure.

343
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:36,100
You two better change into robes.
l expect we'll be arriving soon.

344
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:43,700
You've got dirt on your nose by the way.
Did you know?

345
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,860
Just there.

346
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,980
Right then.
First years this way please!

347
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:07,420
Come on now first years don't be shy.
Come on now hurry up.

348
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:17,380
-Hello Harry.
-Hey Hagrid.

349
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:22,820
Right then. This way to the boats.
Come on now follow me.

350
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,300
Wicked.

351
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,700
Welcome to Hogwarts.

352
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,940
Now in a few moments you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

353
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:50,180
But before you can take your seats
you must be sorted into your houses.

354
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,540
They are Gryffindor Hufflepuff...

355
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:58,180
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

356
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:03,660
Now while you're here your house
will be like your family.

357
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,780
Your triumphs will earn you points.

358
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:12,140
Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.

359
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:17,620
At the end of the year the house
with the most points is awarded the house cup.

360
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,180
Trevor!

361
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,740
Sorry.

362
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,900
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

363
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:38,580
lt's true then
what they're saying on the train.

364
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,620
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

365
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,220
Harry Potter?

366
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:46,540
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

367
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,020
And l'm Malfoy.

368
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,700
Draco Malfoy.

369
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:57,260
Think my name's funny do you?
l've no need to ask yours.

370
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:03,260
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

371
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:08,220
We'll soon find out that some wizarding families
are better than others Potter.

372
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,220
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

373
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,620
l can help you there.

374
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:20,660
l think l can tell the wrong sort
for myself thanks.

375
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,500
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

376
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:51,580
It's not real the ceiling. lt's just bewitched
to look like the night sky.

377
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,820
l read about it
in Hogwarts: A History.

378
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,900
All right will you wait along here please?

379
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:15,140
Now before we begin...

380
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:18,580
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

381
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:23,580
l have a few start-of-term notices
l wish to announce.

382
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,100
The first years please note...

383
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:32,380
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

384
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:38,140
Also our caretaker Mr. Filch
has asked me to remind you...

385
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:42,980
...that the third-floor corridor on the right hand side
is out of bounds...

386
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:47,500
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

387
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,820
Thank you.

388
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:56,660
When l call your name
you will come forth.

389
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,500
l shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

390
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,940
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

391
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,740
Hermione Granger.

392
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,620
Oh no. Okay relax.

393
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:15,380
Mental that one l'm telling you.

394
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:24,740
Ah right then...hmm...right.

395
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,540
Okay. Gryffindor!

396
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:40,140
Draco Malfoy.

397
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:46,900
Slytherin!

398
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,780
There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad
who wasn't in Slytherin.

399
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,500
Susan Bones.

400
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,180
Harry what is it?

401
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,140
Nothing. Nothing l'm fine.

402
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,820
Let's see....

403
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:13,420
l know! Hufflepuff!

404
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:17,580
Ronald Weasley.

405
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:36,420
Another Weasley!
l know just what to do with you.

406
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,420
Gryffindor!

407
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:48,140
Harry Potter.

408
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:09,220
Hmm...difficult very difficult.

409
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,380
Plenty of courage l see.
Not a bad mind either.

410
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,900
There's talent oh yes.

411
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:19,940
And a thirst to prove yourself.

412
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,300
But where to put you?

413
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,380
Not Slytherin not Slytherin!

414
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:29,260
Not Slytherin eh? Are you sure?

415
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:34,380
You could be great you know.
lt's all here in your head.

416
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:39,900
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatnesses no doubt about that.

417
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,860
No? Well if you're sure.

418
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,820
Better be...

419
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,020
...Gryffindor!

420
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:17,340
Your attention please.

421
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:22,060
Let the feast begin.

422
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,540
l'm half and half.

423
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:44,020
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

424
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:47,740
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

425
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,540
Say Percy who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

426
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,980
Oh thats Professor Snape
head of Slytherin house.

427
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:58,100
-What's he teach?
-Potions.

428
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:03,900
But everyone knows its the Dark Arts he fancies.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

429
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,740
Hello! How are you?

430
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:14,380
Welcome to Gryffindor.

431
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,980
Look lt's the Bloody Baron!

432
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:34,380
Hello Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

433
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:40,020
Dismal. Once again my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

434
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,980
l know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

435
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,940
l prefer Sir Nicholas
if you don't mind.

436
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,660
''Nearly'' headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

437
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,980
Like this.

438
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:08,820
Gryffindors follow me please.
Keep up. Thank you.

439
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:13,340
Ravenclaw follow me. This way.

440
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:16,940
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

441
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:21,340
Oh and keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

442
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:36,260
Keep up please and follow me.
Quickly now come on. Come on.

443
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,140
That picture's moving.

444
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:42,860
-Look at that one.
-l think she fancies you.

445
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,940
-Oh look! Look!
-Who's that girl?

446
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,700
Welcome to Hogwarts.

447
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,300
Password?

448
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:10,540
Caput Draconis.

449
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:22,180
Follow me everyone. Keep up.
Quickly come on.

450
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,300
Gather around here.

451
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:32,300
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

452
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:36,940
Boys' dormitory is upstairs and down to your left.
Girls the same on your right.

453
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:40,260
You'll find that your belongings have
already been brought up.

454
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,100
Made it!

455
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:54,740
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

456
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:02,940
-That was bloody brilliant!
-Thank you for that assessment Mr Weasley.

457
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:07,460
Perhaps lt'd be more useful if l were to transfigured
Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocket-watch.

458
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:10,860
-That way one of you might be on time.
-We got lost.

459
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:16,820
Then perhaps a map? l trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

460
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:30,660
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

461
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,500
As such l don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

462
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:38,460
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

463
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,780
However for those select few...

464
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,020
...who possess the predisposition...

465
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,980
...l can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

466
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:56,140
...and ensnare the senses.

467
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,860
l can tell you how to bottle fame...

468
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:05,020
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

469
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:13,940
Then again maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts in ...

470
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:20,100
...possession of abilities so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

471
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:23,260
...to not pay attention.

472
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,820
Mr. Potter.

473
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,860
Our new celebrity.

474
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:44,820
Tell me what would l get if l added powdered root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

475
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,500
You don't know? Well let's try again.

476
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:55,340
Where Mr Potter would you look
if l asked you to find me a bezoar?

477
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,020
l don't know Sir.

478
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:02,140
And what is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

479
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,940
l don't know Sir.

480
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,300
Pity.

481
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:15,260
Clearly fame isn't everything...

482
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,980
...is it Mr. Potter?

483
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:23,000
Clearly Hermione knows.
Seems a pity not to ask her.

484
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,320
Silence.

485
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,480
Put your hand down
you silly girl!

486
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,360
For your information Potter...

487
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:51,040
...asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful
it is known as the Draught of the Living Dead.

488
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:56,600
A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat
and it will save you from most poisons

489
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:03,440
As for monkshood and wolfsbane they are the same
plant which also goes by the name of aconite.

490
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,200
Well...

491
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:12,640
...why aren't you all
copying this down?

492
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,000
And Gryffindors...

493
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:27,520
...note that five points will
be taken from your house...

494
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,040
...for your classmate's cheek.

495
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:53,120
Eye of rabbit harp string hum
Turn this water into rum

496
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:55,880
Eye of rabbit....

497
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,880
What's Seamus trying to do
to that glass of water?

498
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:03,840
Turn it into rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday before--

499
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,480
Mail's here.

500
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:47,720
Can l borrow this? Thanks.

501
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,840
Hey look! Neville's got a Remembrall.

502
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:59,560
l've read about those. When the smoke turns
red it means you've forgotten something.

503
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:03,280
The only problem is l can't remember
what l've forgotten.

504
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:07,000
Hey Ron! Somebody broke into Gringotts.
Listen.

505
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,880
''Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches unknown...

506
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:16,840
...Gringotts goblins while acknowledging
the breach insist nothing was taken.

507
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:22,760
The vault in question number 713
had in fact been emptied earlier that very same day.''

508
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,240
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and l went to.

509
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,880
-Good afternoon class.
-Good afternoon Madam Hooch.

510
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,920
Good afternoon Amanda.
Good afternoon.

511
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,640
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

512
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,800
Well what are you waiting for?
Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick.

513
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:56,600
Come on now hurry up. Stick your right hand
over the broom and say ''Up.''

514
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,760
Up!

515
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,960
Up.

516
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,280
Up.

517
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,600
Up. Up!

518
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,800
With feeling.

519
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,600
Shut up Harry.

520
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:24,480
Now once you've got hold of
your broom l want you to mount it.

521
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:28,680
And grip it tight you don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

522
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:34,040
When l blow my whistle l want each of you
to kick off from the ground hard.

523
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:38,080
Keep your broom steady
hover for a moment...

524
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:42,600
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

525
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,960
On my whistle. Three two....

526
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,760
Mr. Longbottom.

527
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,280
-Mr. Longbottom!
-Down down!

528
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,720
Neville!

529
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,120
Come back down this instant!

530
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,480
Everyone out of the way!

531
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,200
ls he all right?

532
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:50,240
Oh dear it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now up you get.

533
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:56,200
Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground
while l take Mr Longbottom to the hospital wing.

534
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,080
Understand? lf l see
a single broom in the air...

535
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:05,560
...the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts
before they can say Quidditch.

536
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,680
Did you see his face?

537
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:11,720
Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze he'd have
remembered to fall on his fat arse.

538
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,440
Give it here Malfoy.

539
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,960
No. I think l'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

540
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:25,600
How about on the roof?

541
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,600
What's the matter Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

542
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,960
Harry no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

543
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:40,080
Besides you don't even know how to fly.

544
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,280
What an idiot.

545
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:49,160
Give it here or l'll
knock you off your broom!

546
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,520
ls that so?

547
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:56,920
Have it your way then.

548
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:33,280
-Nice going Harry.
-That was wicked Harry!

549
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,560
Harry Potter!

550
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,520
Follow me.

551
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,440
You wait here.

552
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:59,480
Professor Quirrell excuse me.
Could l borrow Wood for a moment please?

553
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,520
Oh yes of course.

554
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:12,960
Potter this is Oliver Wood.
Wood l have found you a Seeker.

555
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:18,560
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

556
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,000
l always knew he'd do well.

557
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:25,520
Seeker? But first years
never make their house teams.

558
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:30,240
-You must be the youngest Quidditch player in--
-A century according to McGonagall.

559
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:33,080
Hey well done Harry.
Wood's just told us.

560
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,760
Fred and George are on the team too.
Beaters.

561
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,680
Our job is to make sure that you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

562
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,560
Can't make any promises of course.
Rough game Quidditch.

563
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,760
Brutal But no one's died in years.
Someone will vanishes occasionally.

564
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,720
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

565
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:55,600
Oh go on Harry. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is and you'll be great too.

566
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,000
But l've never even played Quidditch.
What if l make a fool of myself?

567
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:04,240
You won't make a fool of yourself.
lt's in your blood.

568
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,600
Harry you never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

569
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,640
l didn't know.

570
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,760
l'm telling you it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

571
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,240
Who doesn't?

572
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,280
What's happening?

573
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:38,720
The staircases change remember?

574
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:48,640
-Let's go this way.
-Before the staircase moves again.

575
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:59,680
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

576
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:02,080
We're not supposed to be here.

577
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:06,200
This is the third floor.
lt's forbidden.

578
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,960
Let's go.

579
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:14,040
-lt's Filch's cat!
-Run!

580
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:21,160
Quick let's hide through that door!

581
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,360
-lt's locked!
-Thats it We're done for!

582
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,720
Oh move over!

583
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,800
Alohomora.

584
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,600
Get in.

585
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:38,960
Alohomora?

586
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,680
Standard Book of Spells
chapter seven.

587
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,280
Anyone here my sweet?

588
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,520
Come on.

589
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,880
-Filch is gone.
-Probably thinks this door's locked.

590
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:59,760
-lt was locked.
-And for good reason.

591
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:30,920
What do they think they're doing? Keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school.

592
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:34,800
You don't use your eyes do you? Didn't you see
what it was standing on?

593
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,160
l wasn't looking at its feet!
l was a bit preoccupied with its heads.

594
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,240
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

595
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,120
lt was standing on a trap door.
Which means it wasn't there by accident.

596
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:49,880
-lt's guarding something.
-Guarding something?

597
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:54,040
That's right. Now if you two don't mind
l'm going to bed...

598
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:57,880
...before either of you come up with another clever
idea to get us killed.

599
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:01,240
Or worse expelled.

600
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:08,760
She needs to sort out her priorities.

601
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:17,600
Quidditch is easy enough to understand.
Each team has seven players.

602
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:23,520
Three Chasers two Beaters
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

603
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:32,720
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

604
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:38,880
Now the Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those three hoops.

605
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:43,480
The Keeper that's me
defends the hoops. With me so far?

606
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:48,160
l think so. What are those?

607
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,600
You better take this.

608
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:05,480
Careful now it's coming back.

609
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:15,680
Not bad Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

610
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:34,600
What was that?

611
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:39,120
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

612
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:42,840
But you are a Seeker.

613
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:51,000
The only thing l want you
to worry about is this.

614
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,760
The Golden Snitch.

615
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,960
-l like this ball.
-You like it now.

616
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:01,200
Just wait. lt's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

617
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,360
What do l do with it?

618
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,800
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

619
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,520
You catch this the game's over.

620
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:13,680
You catch this Potter
and we win.

621
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:28,080
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

622
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:32,280
...or the ability to make objects fly.

623
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,880
Do you have your feathers? Good.

624
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:40,280
Now don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

625
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,800
The swish and flick. Everyone.

626
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:50,000
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh and enunciate.

627
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:55,000
Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go then.

628
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,520
Wingardium Leviosa.

629
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,120
Wingardium Leviosa.

630
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,200
No stop stop stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

631
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:15,440
Besides you're saying it wrong.
lt's Leviosa not Leviosar.

632
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,240
You do it then if you're so clever.
Go on go on.

633
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:24,560
Wingardium Leviosa.

634
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:37,720
Oh well done! See here everyone
Miss Granger's done it!

635
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,560
Splendid!

636
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,360
Well done dear.

637
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,680
l think we're going to need
another feather over here Professor.

638
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:02,440
''lt's Leviosa not Leviosar.''

639
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:08,040
She's a nightmare honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

640
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:11,240
l think she heard you.

641
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,960
Where's Hermione?

642
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:45,320
Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't
come out of the girl's bathroom.

643
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:49,600
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon crying.

644
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:57,680
Troll! In the dungeon!

645
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:01,280
Troll in the dungeon!

646
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,400
Thought you ought to know.

647
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:16,120
Silence!

648
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:21,760
Everyone will please not panic!

649
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,000
Now...

650
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:28,760
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

651
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:34,280
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

652
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:48,480
Gryffindors keep up please
and stay alert.

653
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,440
How could a troll get in?

654
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:55,840
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

655
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:00,040
-What?
-Hermione! She doesn't know.

656
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:15,400
l think the troll's left the dungeon.

657
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,440
lt's going into the girl's bathroom.

658
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:54,840
Hermione move!

659
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:02,360
Help! Help!

660
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,440
Hey pea brain!

661
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,760
Help!

662
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,280
Do something!

663
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:49,680
-What?
-Anything!

664
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:52,720
-Hurry up!
-Swish and flick.

665
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,240
Wingardium Leviosa.

666
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,160
Cool.

667
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,400
ls it dead?

668
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:39,560
l don't think so. Just knocked out.

669
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:48,120
Troll bogies.

670
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,200
Oh my goodness!
Explain yourselves both of you!

671
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:59,040
-Well what it is--
-lt's my fault Professor McGonagall.

672
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,400
Miss Granger?

673
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:08,360
l went looking for the troll.
l'd read about them and thought l could handle it.

674
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,440
But l was wrong.

675
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:15,720
lf Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me l'd probably be dead.

676
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:21,120
Be that as it may it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

677
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:27,000
l would've expected more rational behavior
on your part and am very disappointed in you Ms. Granger.

678
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,200
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

679
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:34,000
...for your serious lack of judgment.

680
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,480
As for you two gentlemen...

681
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:40,120
...l just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

682
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,720
Not many first-year students
could take on a full grown mountain troll...

683
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,560
...and live to tell the tale.

684
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,240
Five points...

685
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,760
...will be awarded to each of you...

686
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:58,400
...for sheer dumb luck.

687
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,760
Perhaps you ought to go.
lt might wake up.

688
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:21,470
-Good of you to get us out of trouble like that.
-Mind you we did save her life.

689
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:26,310
Mind you she might not have needed saving
if you hadn't insulted her.

690
01:17:26,590 --> 01:17:29,830
What are friends for?

691
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:34,700
Take a bit of toast mate. Go on.

692
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:38,100
Ron's right Harry.
You're gonna need your strength today.

693
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:40,540
l'm not hungry.

694
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:46,740
Good luck today Potter.
Then again now that you've proven yourself against a troll.

695
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:50,140
A little game of Quidditch
should be easy work for you.

696
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:53,460
Even if it is against Slytherin.

697
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:04,540
-That explains the blood.
-Blood?

698
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:09,100
Listen last night l'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

699
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:11,980
...so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog.

700
01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:14,940
But he got himself bitten
that's why he's limping.

701
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:17,420
But why would anyone go near that dog?

702
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:21,340
The day l was at Gringotts Hagrid took
something out of one of the vaults.

703
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:24,780
He said it was Hogwarts business
very secret.

704
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:26,100
So you're saying--

705
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:30,820
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

706
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:47,940
-Bit early for mail isn't it?
-But l never get mail.

707
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:50,020
Let's open it.

708
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:01,460
lt's a broomstick.

709
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:06,380
That's not just a broomstick Harry
it's a Nimbus 2000!

710
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:09,860
But who--?

711
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,020
-Scared Harry?
-A little.

712
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:37,900
That's all right. l felt the same way
before my first game.

713
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:41,620
-What happened?
-Er l don't really remember.

714
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:44,580
l took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

715
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,620
Woke up in the hospital a week later.

716
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:13,180
Hello! Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

717
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:18,100
Today's game
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

718
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:50,860
The players take their positions
as madam Hooch...

719
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:54,860
...steps out onto
the field to begin the game!

720
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:58,380
Now l want a nice clean game...

721
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,460
...from all of you!

722
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:09,500
The Bludgers are up
followed by the Golden Snitch.

723
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:12,420
Remember the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

724
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:16,420
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

725
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:26,660
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

726
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:50,140
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

727
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:56,620
Well done!

728
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:06,700
Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

729
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:41,540
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

730
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:57,220
Give me that!

731
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:31,300
Take that side!

732
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:24,020
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

733
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:35,140
lt's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

734
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:39,740
-Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
-Leave it to me.

735
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,060
Come on Hermione!

736
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:20,900
Lacarnum lnflamarae.

737
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:31,060
Fire! You're on fire!

738
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:51,060
Go go go go!

739
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:45,420
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

740
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:47,940
He's got the Snitch!

741
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:52,260
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

742
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:54,140
Gryffindor wins!

743
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:41,980
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

744
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:46,100
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?

745
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:48,740
-Who told you about Fluffy?
-Fluffy?

746
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:52,620
-That thing has a name?
-Of course he h's got a name. He's mine.

747
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:58,100
l bought him off an lrish feller l met down at the pub last year.
Then l lent him to Dumbledore to guard the--

748
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:02,900
Shouldn't have said that. No more questions!
Don't ask any more questions. That's top-secret that is.

749
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:07,500
But Hagrid whatever Fluffy's guarding
Snape's trying to steal it.

750
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:11,180
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

751
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:16,740
Hogwarts teacher or not l know a spell when
l see one. l've read all about them.

752
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:20,540
You've got to keep eye contact
and Snape wasn't blinking.

753
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:23,020
Exactly.

754
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:26,420
Now you listen to me
all three of you.

755
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:31,300
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. lt's dangerous.

756
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:36,620
What that dog is guarding is strictly
between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

757
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:38,220
Nicholas Flamel?

758
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:43,940
l shouldn't have said that.
l should not have said that.

759
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:48,260
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

760
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:50,460
l don't know.

761
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:12,140
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

762
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:15,180
Ring the Hogwart bell

763
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:18,180
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

764
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:21,300
Cast a Christmas spell

765
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:38,260
Knight to e5.

766
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:48,100
Queen to e5.

767
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:55,140
That's totally barbaric!

768
01:29:55,780 --> 01:29:59,300
That's wizard's chess.
l see you've packed.

769
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:00,980
l see you haven't.

770
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:06,500
Change of plans. My parents decided to go
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

771
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:10,540
-He's studying dragons there.
-Good. You can help Harry then.

772
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:14,100
He's going to go and look in the library
for information on Nicholas Flamel.

773
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:17,820
We've looked a hundred times!

774
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:23,700
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

775
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:28,860
l think we've had
a bad influence on her.

776
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:35,740
Harry wake up!
Come on Harry wake up!

777
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:48,900
-Happy Christmas Harry.
-Happy Christmas Ron.

778
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:51,340
What are you wearing?

779
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:55,620
Oh my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

780
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:59,180
-l've got presents?
-Yeah.

781
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:08,660
There they are.

782
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:23,180
''Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

783
01:31:23,420 --> 01:31:27,580
lt is time it was returned to you.
Use it well.''

784
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:48,100
-What is it?
-Some kind of cloak.

785
01:31:48,380 --> 01:31:51,300
Well let's see then. Put it on.

786
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:58,020
My body's gone!

787
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:01,820
l know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

788
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:04,260
l'm invisible?

789
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:09,140
They're really rare.
l wonder who gave it to you.

790
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:14,420
There was no name.
lt just said ''Use it well.''

791
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:48,340
Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.

792
01:32:48,580 --> 01:32:54,420
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

793
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:15,140
Who's there?

794
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:26,900
l know you're in there.
You can't hide.

795
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:38,020
Who is it? Show yourself.

796
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:26,580
Severus l....

797
01:34:27,260 --> 01:34:31,140
You don't want me
as your enemy Quirrell.

798
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:36,060
-l don't know what you mean.
-You know perfectly well what l mean.

799
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:56,500
We'll have another little chat soon.

800
01:34:56,700 --> 01:35:02,140
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

801
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:06,820
Professors. l found this
in the restricted section.

802
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:12,420
lt's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

803
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:46,340
Mum?

804
01:36:49,580 --> 01:36:51,580
Dad?

805
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:31,300
Ron you've really gotta see this!
Ron you've gotta see this!

806
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:36,020
Ron Ron come on get out of bed!

807
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:39,820
-Why?
-There's something you've got to see. Now come on!

808
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:50,820
Come on! Come!
Come look it's my parents!

809
01:37:52,300 --> 01:37:54,260
l only see us.

810
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:57,820
Look in properly.
Go on stand there.

811
01:37:58,060 --> 01:38:03,980
-There. You see them don't you?
-That's me! Only l'm head boy.

812
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:06,820
And l'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

813
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:11,220
And bloody hell!
l'm Quidditch captain too!

814
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:14,820
l look good.

815
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:19,260
Harry do you think this mirror
shows the future?

816
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:24,460
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

817
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:40,320
Do you like yours Ron?

818
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:48,240
-Ron?
-l'll be right back.

819
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:01,400
-Wanna play chess?
-No.

820
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:06,160
-Wanna go and visit Hagrid?
-No.

821
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:09,920
Harry l know what you're thinking
but don't.

822
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:14,080
There's something not right
about that mirror.

823
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:42,740
Back again Harry?

824
01:39:45,860 --> 01:39:48,340
l see that you
like so many before you...

825
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:52,740
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

826
01:39:53,060 --> 01:39:57,220
l trust by now
you realize what it does.

827
01:39:58,540 --> 01:40:01,060
Let me give you a clue.

828
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:03,740
The happiest man on earth...

829
01:40:03,940 --> 01:40:07,340
...would look into the mirror
and see only himself...

830
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:09,860
...exactly as he is.

831
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:15,140
So then it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

832
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:18,100
Yes. And no.

833
01:40:19,140 --> 01:40:21,580
lt shows us nothing more or less...

834
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:27,780
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

835
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:32,700
Now you Harry who have
never known your family...

836
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:36,780
...you see them standing beside you.

837
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:39,380
But remember this Harry.

838
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:45,540
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

839
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:47,860
...or truth.

840
01:40:48,820 --> 01:40:54,860
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

841
01:40:55,900 --> 01:41:00,060
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.

842
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:02,180
And l must ask you...

843
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:07,020
...not to go looking for it again.

844
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:10,900
lt does not do to dwell on dreams Harry...

845
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:14,340
...and forget to live.

846
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:12,680
Hi Hedwig.

847
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:18,320
Look at you playing with your cards.
Pathetic!

848
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,600
We've got final exams coming up soon.

849
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:23,360
l'm ready. Ask me any question.

850
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:27,920
Alright what are the 3 most crucial ingredients
in a Forgetfulness Potion?

851
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:29,360
l forgot.

852
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:32,600
And what may l ask do you plan to do
if this comes up in the final exam?

853
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,880
-Copy off you.
-No you won't.

854
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:41,000
Besides according to Professor McGonagall we're to be given special
quills bewitched with an Anti-Cheating Spell.

855
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:47,560
That's insulting! lt's as if they
don't trust us! Dumbledore again!

856
01:42:51,200 --> 01:42:55,240
-Leg-Locker Curse?
-Malfoy.

857
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:03,480
You have got to start
standing up to people Neville.

858
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:07,200
How? l can barely stand at all!

859
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:09,480
l'll do the countercurse!

860
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:14,080
No that's all l need!
You to set my bloody kneecups on fire!

861
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:17,560
l don't appreciate
the insinuation Longbottom.

862
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:20,920
Besides if anyone cared to notice...

863
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:25,520
...my eyebrows have
completely grown back!

864
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,120
l found him!

865
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:36,360
''Dumbledore is particularly famous for his
defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945.''

866
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:39,800
-Go on!
-''For the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon blood...

867
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,080
...and his work on alchemy with his
partner Nicholas Flamel'' !

868
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:46,640
l knew the name sound familiar.
l read it on the train that day.

869
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:49,280
Follow me!

870
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:56,760
Hey! Wait! Where are you going?

871
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:01,840
What about the countercurse?

872
01:44:03,310 --> 01:44:08,990
l had you looking in the wrong section.
How could l be so stupid?

873
01:44:09,230 --> 01:44:12,350
l checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

874
01:44:12,550 --> 01:44:14,550
This is light?

875
01:44:19,110 --> 01:44:21,550
Of course! Here it is!

876
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:25,750
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Sorcerer's Stone.

877
01:44:26,030 --> 01:44:27,190
The what?

878
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:30,870
Honestly don't you two read?

879
01:44:31,070 --> 01:44:35,550
''The Sorcerer's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

880
01:44:35,790 --> 01:44:38,390
lt'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

881
01:44:38,590 --> 01:44:42,630
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal.''

882
01:44:42,830 --> 01:44:44,990
-lmmortal?
-lt means you'll never die.

883
01:44:45,190 --> 01:44:47,270
l know what it means!

884
01:44:48,150 --> 01:44:52,870
''The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

885
01:44:53,070 --> 01:44:58,270
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday.''

886
01:44:59,950 --> 01:45:02,150
That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor.

887
01:45:02,350 --> 01:45:07,070
That's what's under the trap door.
The Sorcerer's Stone.

888
01:45:23,830 --> 01:45:27,630
Oh hello sorry don't wish to be rude
but l'm in no fit state to entertain today.

889
01:45:27,830 --> 01:45:30,550
We know about the Sorcerer's Stone.

890
01:45:35,230 --> 01:45:40,390
-We think Snape's trying to steal it.
-Snape? Blimey you're not still on about him are you?

891
01:45:40,590 --> 01:45:43,390
Hagrid we know he's after the Stone.
We just don't know why.

892
01:45:43,750 --> 01:45:48,190
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He's not about to steal it.

893
01:45:48,190 --> 01:45:49,270
What?

894
01:45:49,430 --> 01:45:53,050
You heard. Right. Come on now
l'm a bit preoccupied today.

895
01:45:53,070 --> 01:45:55,710
Wait a minute.
''One of the teachers''?

896
01:45:55,950 --> 01:45:59,830
Of course! There are other things
defending the Stone aren't there?

897
01:46:00,030 --> 01:46:02,630
-Spells enchantments.
-That's right.

898
01:46:02,910 --> 01:46:05,950
Waste of bloody time if you ask me.

899
01:46:06,150 --> 01:46:08,230
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

900
01:46:08,430 --> 01:46:12,110
Ain't a soul knows how
except for me and Dumbledore.

901
01:46:12,350 --> 01:46:15,950
l shouldn't have told you that.
l should not have told you that.

902
01:46:29,790 --> 01:46:34,870
-Hagrid what exactly is that?
-That? lt's....

903
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:37,150
l know what that is!

904
01:46:37,350 --> 01:46:39,990
But Hagrid how did you get one?

905
01:46:40,350 --> 01:46:43,590
l won it. Off a stranger
l met down at the pub.

906
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:47,910
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it
as a matter of fact.

907
01:47:10,150 --> 01:47:12,350
ls that...

908
01:47:13,150 --> 01:47:14,310
...a dragon?

909
01:47:14,510 --> 01:47:18,950
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

910
01:47:19,150 --> 01:47:22,030
My brother Charlie works
with these in Romania.

911
01:47:22,230 --> 01:47:27,110
lsn't he beautiful? Oh bless him.
Look he knows his mummy.

912
01:47:27,790 --> 01:47:29,510
Hello Norbert.

913
01:47:29,870 --> 01:47:34,150
-Norbert?
-Yeah well He's gotta have a name don't he?

914
01:47:34,910 --> 01:47:37,350
Don't you Norbert?

915
01:47:44,350 --> 01:47:47,470
He'll have to be trained up a bit
of course.

916
01:47:51,350 --> 01:47:53,430
Who's that?

917
01:47:55,150 --> 01:47:57,230
Malfoy.

918
01:47:57,990 --> 01:47:59,390
Oh dear.

919
01:48:01,110 --> 01:48:05,910
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
He told me so the first time l met him.

920
01:48:06,110 --> 01:48:10,150
lt's crazy.
And worse Malfoy knows.

921
01:48:10,350 --> 01:48:14,430
-l don't understand. ls that bad?
-lt's bad.

922
01:48:14,750 --> 01:48:16,910
Good evening.

923
01:48:20,550 --> 01:48:23,470
Nothing l repeat nothing...

924
01:48:23,710 --> 01:48:27,230
...gives a student the right
to walk about the school at night.

925
01:48:27,430 --> 01:48:32,310
Therefore as punishment for your actions
50 points will be taken.

926
01:48:32,510 --> 01:48:34,830
-50?!
-Each.

927
01:48:35,870 --> 01:48:38,270
And to ensure it doesn't happen again...

928
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:41,790
...all four of you
will receive detention.

929
01:48:42,710 --> 01:48:45,670
Excuse me professor
perhaps l heard you wrong.

930
01:48:45,910 --> 01:48:48,230
l thought you said the four of us.

931
01:48:48,430 --> 01:48:50,950
No you heard me correctly Mr. Malfoy.

932
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:56,150
You see honorable as your intentions were
you too were out of bed after hours.

933
01:48:56,630 --> 01:48:59,590
You will join your classmates
in detention.

934
01:49:10,790 --> 01:49:14,790
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

935
01:49:14,990 --> 01:49:19,710
There was a time detention would find you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

936
01:49:19,910 --> 01:49:22,750
God l miss the screaming.

937
01:49:25,310 --> 01:49:28,590
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

938
01:49:28,830 --> 01:49:34,150
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

939
01:49:36,230 --> 01:49:39,190
A sorry lot this Hagrid.

940
01:49:40,670 --> 01:49:45,670
Oh good God man you're not still on
about that bloody dragon are you?

941
01:49:47,910 --> 01:49:49,990
Norbert's gone.

942
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:54,070
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

943
01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:57,630
Well that's good isn't it?
He'll be with his own kind.

944
01:49:57,790 --> 01:50:00,150
Yeah but what if he don't like Romania?

945
01:50:00,350 --> 01:50:04,590
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby after all.

946
01:50:05,230 --> 01:50:10,470
Oh for God's sake pull yourself together man.
You're going into the Forest after all.

947
01:50:10,710 --> 01:50:13,070
Got to have your wits about you.

948
01:50:13,270 --> 01:50:18,950
The Forest? l thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

949
01:50:19,390 --> 01:50:23,230
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

950
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:26,030
...werewolves.

951
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:29,750
There's more than werewolves
in those trees lad.

952
01:50:29,950 --> 01:50:32,630
You can be sure of that.

953
01:50:34,590 --> 01:50:35,990
Nighty-night.

954
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:41,430
Right. Let's go.

955
01:51:19,630 --> 01:51:22,070
Hagrid what is that?

956
01:51:22,270 --> 01:51:25,630
What we're here for.
See that?

957
01:51:26,150 --> 01:51:31,510
That's unicorn blood that is.
l found one dead a few weeks ago.

958
01:51:32,070 --> 01:51:36,670
Now this one's been hurt bad
by something.

959
01:51:44,150 --> 01:51:49,910
So it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

960
01:51:50,110 --> 01:51:53,270
Ron Hermione you'll come with me.

961
01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:56,990
And Harry you'll go with Malfoy.

962
01:51:58,270 --> 01:52:00,550
Okay. Then l get Fang.

963
01:52:00,710 --> 01:52:06,470
Fine. Just so you know
he's a bloody coward.

964
01:52:10,150 --> 01:52:15,150
You wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

965
01:52:15,350 --> 01:52:19,270
lf l didn't know better Draco
l'd say you were scared.

966
01:52:19,470 --> 01:52:22,070
l'm not scared Potter.

967
01:52:23,190 --> 01:52:25,150
Did you hear that?

968
01:52:27,710 --> 01:52:29,110
Come on Fang.

969
01:52:29,310 --> 01:52:30,830
Scared!

970
01:52:55,830 --> 01:52:57,990
What is it Fang?

971
01:54:08,350 --> 01:54:13,830
Harry Potter you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

972
01:54:14,070 --> 01:54:18,070
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

973
01:54:18,270 --> 01:54:21,030
What was that thing you saved me from?

974
01:54:21,230 --> 01:54:26,550
A monstrous creature.
lt is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

975
01:54:26,790 --> 01:54:32,310
Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep
you alive even if you are an inch from death.

976
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:37,630
But at a terrible price. You
have slain something so pure...

977
01:54:37,830 --> 01:54:42,670
...that from the moment the blood touches
your lips you will have a half-life.

978
01:54:42,870 --> 01:54:44,670
A cursed life.

979
01:54:44,870 --> 01:54:48,830
-But who would choose such a life?
-Can you think of no one?

980
01:54:49,070 --> 01:54:54,030
Do you mean to say that
thing that killed the unicorn...

981
01:54:54,350 --> 01:54:58,270
...that was drinking its blood
that was Voldemort?

982
01:54:58,470 --> 01:55:03,630
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment Mr. Potter?

983
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:06,030
The Sorcerer's Stone.

984
01:55:07,350 --> 01:55:09,350
Harry!

985
01:55:09,950 --> 01:55:14,470
Hello there Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

986
01:55:14,670 --> 01:55:16,830
You all right there Harry?

987
01:55:17,950 --> 01:55:22,270
Harry Potter
this is where l leave you.

988
01:55:23,110 --> 01:55:26,950
You're safe now. Good luck.

989
01:55:34,590 --> 01:55:38,710
You mean You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

990
01:55:38,950 --> 01:55:41,710
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

991
01:55:41,950 --> 01:55:44,870
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

992
01:55:45,070 --> 01:55:49,430
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants the stone for Voldemort.

993
01:55:49,670 --> 01:55:54,190
With the Elixir of Life
Voldemort will be strong again.

994
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:55,990
He'll come back.

995
01:55:56,190 --> 01:55:57,950
But if he comes back...

996
01:55:58,190 --> 01:56:02,150
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you do you?

997
01:56:03,150 --> 01:56:06,710
l think if he'd had the chance
he might have tried to kill me tonight.

998
01:56:06,910 --> 01:56:10,510
And to think l've been worrying
about my Potions final.

999
01:56:10,710 --> 01:56:14,310
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

1000
01:56:14,670 --> 01:56:19,550
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

1001
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:25,430
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around Harry you're safe.

1002
01:56:25,630 --> 01:56:29,710
As long as Dumbledore is around
you can't be touched.

1003
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:40,870
l'd always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were
frightful but l found that rather enjoyable.

1004
01:56:41,070 --> 01:56:44,750
Speak for yourself.
All right there Harry?

1005
01:56:44,950 --> 01:56:50,150
-My scar. lt keeps burning.
-lt's happened before.

1006
01:56:50,350 --> 01:56:52,990
-Not like this.
-Perhaps you should see the nurse.

1007
01:56:53,230 --> 01:56:56,710
l think it's a warning.
lt means danger's coming.

1008
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:06,830
-Of course!
-What is it?

1009
01:57:07,030 --> 01:57:10,790
Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...

1010
01:57:10,990 --> 01:57:14,070
...and a stranger turns up who
just happens to have one?

1011
01:57:14,270 --> 01:57:16,950
I mean how many people wander around
with dragon eggs in their pockets?

1012
01:57:17,150 --> 01:57:19,430
Why didn't l see it before?

1013
01:57:24,990 --> 01:57:28,610
Hagrid who gave you the dragon egg?
What did he look like?

1014
01:57:28,710 --> 01:57:31,570
I don't know l never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

1015
01:57:31,670 --> 01:57:34,270
The stranger though You and he
must have talked.

1016
01:57:34,830 --> 01:57:38,390
Well he wanted to know what sort
of creatures l looked after.

1017
01:57:38,590 --> 01:57:42,590
l told him. l said ''After Fluffy
a dragon's gonna be no problem.''

1018
01:57:42,790 --> 01:57:47,270
-And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
-Well of course he was interested in Fluffy.

1019
01:57:47,670 --> 01:57:51,870
How often do you come across a
three-headed dog even if you're in the trade?

1020
01:57:52,070 --> 01:57:57,710
But l told him. I said ''The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him.''

1021
01:57:57,910 --> 01:58:03,390
Take Fluffy for example. Just play him a bit of
music and he falls straight to sleep.

1022
01:58:04,990 --> 01:58:07,710
l shouldn't have told you that.

1023
01:58:07,950 --> 01:58:10,150
Where are you going? Wait!

1024
01:58:17,190 --> 01:58:19,910
We have to see Professor Dumbledore.
lmmediately!

1025
01:58:20,390 --> 01:58:23,030
l'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here.

1026
01:58:23,230 --> 01:58:27,910
He received an urgent owl from the
Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.

1027
01:58:27,950 --> 01:58:30,670
He's gone? Now?
But this is important!

1028
01:58:30,750 --> 01:58:32,950
This is about the Sorcerer's Stone!

1029
01:58:34,870 --> 01:58:38,590
-How do you know--?
-Someone's going to try and steal it.

1030
01:58:39,190 --> 01:58:44,430
l don't know how you three found out about the stone
but l assure you it is perfectly well protected.

1031
01:58:44,630 --> 01:58:48,910
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

1032
01:58:57,230 --> 01:59:00,030
That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village.
lt was Snape.

1033
01:59:00,230 --> 01:59:02,870
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

1034
01:59:03,110 --> 01:59:06,990
-And with Dumbledore gone--
-Good afternoon.

1035
01:59:09,030 --> 01:59:12,200
Now what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves...

1036
01:59:12,350 --> 01:59:16,670
...be doing inside on a day like this?

1037
01:59:21,390 --> 01:59:24,950
-We were just--
-You ought to be careful.

1038
01:59:25,510 --> 01:59:27,470
People will think you're...

1039
01:59:31,750 --> 01:59:34,470
...up to something.

1040
01:59:44,750 --> 01:59:46,750
Now what do we do?

1041
01:59:46,990 --> 01:59:50,710
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

1042
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:05,950
Trevor.

1043
02:00:06,270 --> 02:00:09,710
Trevor shh! go! You shouldn't be here!

1044
02:00:09,950 --> 02:00:15,390
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again aren't you?

1045
02:00:15,590 --> 02:00:19,550
-Now Neville listen. We were--
-No l won't let you!

1046
02:00:19,790 --> 02:00:24,390
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
l'll fight you.

1047
02:00:24,590 --> 02:00:28,910
Neville l'm really really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

1048
02:00:36,870 --> 02:00:40,670
You're a little scary sometimes
you know that?

1049
02:00:40,910 --> 02:00:44,550
Brilliant but scary.

1050
02:00:45,190 --> 02:00:47,230
Let's go.

1051
02:00:47,470 --> 02:00:51,710
-Sorry.
-lt's for your own good you know.

1052
02:00:57,110 --> 02:01:01,110
-Ow! You stood on my foot!
-Sorry.

1053
02:01:04,950 --> 02:01:07,030
Alohomora.

1054
02:01:19,030 --> 02:01:21,590
Wait a minute. He's...

1055
02:01:22,830 --> 02:01:24,990
...snoring.

1056
02:01:27,510 --> 02:01:33,030
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

1057
02:01:34,630 --> 02:01:37,630
lt's got horrible breath.

1058
02:01:40,230 --> 02:01:42,310
-We have to move its paw.
-What?

1059
02:01:42,510 --> 02:01:43,910
Come on!

1060
02:01:47,990 --> 02:01:50,070
Okay. Push.

1061
02:02:13,190 --> 02:02:16,830
l'll go first. Don't follow
until l give you a sign.

1062
02:02:17,030 --> 02:02:22,030
lf something bad happens
get yourselves out.

1063
02:02:22,830 --> 02:02:26,310
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

1064
02:02:26,990 --> 02:02:28,830
The harp.

1065
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:32,230
lt's stopped playing.

1066
02:02:42,270 --> 02:02:43,390
Jump!

1067
02:02:57,590 --> 02:03:01,190
Lucky this plant thing's here really.

1068
02:03:15,630 --> 02:03:18,710
Stop moving both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1069
02:03:18,950 --> 02:03:22,630
You have to relax. lf you don't
it will only kill you faster.

1070
02:03:22,870 --> 02:03:27,870
Kill us faster?
Oh now l can relax!

1071
02:03:30,110 --> 02:03:31,430
Hermione!

1072
02:03:32,030 --> 02:03:35,830
-Now what are we gonna do?
-Just relax!

1073
02:03:36,030 --> 02:03:40,550
-Hermione where are you?
-Do what l say! Trust me.

1074
02:03:47,630 --> 02:03:50,950
-Are you okay?
-Yeah l'm fine.

1075
02:03:51,190 --> 02:03:54,230
-He's not relaxing is he?
-Apparently not.

1076
02:03:54,430 --> 02:03:56,990
-We've gotta do something.
-What?

1077
02:03:57,190 --> 02:04:00,110
l remember reading something
in Herbology.

1078
02:04:00,990 --> 02:04:04,830
Devil's Snare Devil's Snare.
lt's deadly fun...

1079
02:04:05,030 --> 02:04:09,390
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! Devil Snare hates sunlight.

1080
02:04:09,670 --> 02:04:11,710
Lumus Solem.

1081
02:04:19,790 --> 02:04:22,390
-Ron you okay?
-Yeah.

1082
02:04:25,070 --> 02:04:27,550
Lucky we didn't panic.

1083
02:04:28,310 --> 02:04:31,790
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1084
02:04:33,430 --> 02:04:34,910
What is that?

1085
02:04:35,150 --> 02:04:38,830
l don't know. Sounds like wings.

1086
02:04:51,990 --> 02:04:55,430
Curious. l've never seen
birds like these.

1087
02:04:55,670 --> 02:04:59,270
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1088
02:04:59,510 --> 02:05:02,950
And l'll bet one of them
fits that door.

1089
02:05:06,430 --> 02:05:11,030
-What's this all about?
-l don't know.

1090
02:05:16,910 --> 02:05:18,990
Strange.

1091
02:05:19,390 --> 02:05:21,670
Alohomora!

1092
02:05:24,630 --> 02:05:26,910
Well it was worth a try.

1093
02:05:27,110 --> 02:05:30,350
What're we going to do?
There must be a thousand keys up there.

1094
02:05:30,550 --> 02:05:34,470
We're looking for a big old fashioned one.
Probably rusty like the handle.

1095
02:05:34,710 --> 02:05:38,110
There! l see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1096
02:05:41,710 --> 02:05:44,030
What's wrong Harry?

1097
02:05:44,910 --> 02:05:46,430
lt's too simple.

1098
02:05:46,630 --> 02:05:51,390
Oh go on Harry! lf Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick you can.

1099
02:05:51,590 --> 02:05:55,150
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1100
02:06:11,990 --> 02:06:14,990
This complicates things a bit.

1101
02:06:36,270 --> 02:06:38,190
Catch the key!

1102
02:06:42,590 --> 02:06:44,510
Hurry up!

1103
02:07:16,990 --> 02:07:21,670
l don't like this.
l don't like this at all.

1104
02:07:21,870 --> 02:07:25,070
Where are we? A graveyard.

1105
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:28,070
This is no graveyard.

1106
02:07:35,550 --> 02:07:38,470
lt's a chessboard.

1107
02:07:50,470 --> 02:07:52,390
There's the door.

1108
02:08:04,430 --> 02:08:05,950
Now what do we do?

1109
02:08:06,310 --> 02:08:10,430
lt's obvious isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1110
02:08:11,030 --> 02:08:14,790
Alright. Harry you take
the empty bishop's square.

1111
02:08:15,110 --> 02:08:19,310
Hermione you'll be
the queen-side castle.

1112
02:08:19,590 --> 02:08:23,630
As for me l'll be a knight.

1113
02:08:30,790 --> 02:08:32,510
What happens now?

1114
02:08:33,310 --> 02:08:36,310
Well white moves first.

1115
02:08:36,510 --> 02:08:38,390
And then...

1116
02:08:40,150 --> 02:08:41,390
...we play.

1117
02:08:51,990 --> 02:08:57,030
Ron you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1118
02:08:57,270 --> 02:09:00,830
...real wizard's chess do you?

1119
02:09:01,190 --> 02:09:04,150
You there d5.

1120
02:09:18,750 --> 02:09:20,350
Yes Hermione.

1121
02:09:20,550 --> 02:09:25,630
l think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

1122
02:09:31,550 --> 02:09:34,070
Castle to e4!

1123
02:09:37,670 --> 02:09:39,990
Pawn to c3!

1124
02:10:24,630 --> 02:10:28,630
-Wait a minute.
-You understand right Harry.

1125
02:10:28,870 --> 02:10:33,590
Once l make my move
the queen will take me.

1126
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:36,550
Then you're free to check the king.

1127
02:10:36,750 --> 02:10:39,470
-No. Ron no!
-What is it?

1128
02:10:40,070 --> 02:10:44,750
-He's going to sacrifice himself.
-No you can't! there must be another way!

1129
02:10:44,950 --> 02:10:48,710
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1130
02:10:48,910 --> 02:10:52,510
Harry it's you that has to go on.
l know it.

1131
02:10:53,030 --> 02:10:55,750
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1132
02:11:06,030 --> 02:11:08,950
Knight to h3.

1133
02:11:29,870 --> 02:11:31,870
Check.

1134
02:12:01,030 --> 02:12:02,830
Ron!

1135
02:12:03,030 --> 02:12:08,830
No don't move!
Don't forget we're still playing.

1136
02:12:23,910 --> 02:12:25,190
Checkmate.

1137
02:12:45,110 --> 02:12:47,630
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1138
02:12:47,830 --> 02:12:51,710
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1139
02:12:51,910 --> 02:12:53,790
l have to go on.

1140
02:12:54,310 --> 02:13:00,230
You'll be okay Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1141
02:13:00,430 --> 02:13:02,950
Not as good as you.

1142
02:13:03,790 --> 02:13:08,590
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1143
02:13:09,830 --> 02:13:15,430
Friendship and bravery.
And Harry just be careful.

1144
02:13:53,510 --> 02:13:55,190
You?

1145
02:13:55,990 --> 02:13:59,830
No it can't be.
Snape he was the--

1146
02:14:00,030 --> 02:14:03,070
Yes he does seem the type
doesn't he?

1147
02:14:03,270 --> 02:14:06,430
Next to him who would suspect...

1148
02:14:06,630 --> 02:14:10,550
...poor stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

1149
02:14:10,750 --> 02:14:16,150
But that day during the Quidditch match
Snape tried to kill me.

1150
02:14:16,350 --> 02:14:19,150
No dear boy. l tried to kill you!

1151
02:14:19,630 --> 02:14:23,790
And trust me if Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1152
02:14:24,030 --> 02:14:26,230
...l would have succeeded.

1153
02:14:26,430 --> 02:14:29,430
Even with Snape muttering
his little countercurse.

1154
02:14:29,630 --> 02:14:31,870
Snape was trying to save me?

1155
02:14:32,070 --> 02:14:37,390
l knew you were a danger to me right from the off.
Especially after Halloween.

1156
02:14:37,630 --> 02:14:41,870
-Then you let the troll in!
-Very good Potter yes.

1157
02:14:42,070 --> 02:14:45,070
Snape unfortunately wasn't fooled.

1158
02:14:45,670 --> 02:14:50,630
While everyone else was running about dungeon
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1159
02:14:51,550 --> 02:14:55,030
He of course never trusted me again.

1160
02:14:56,070 --> 02:15:01,310
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1161
02:15:01,510 --> 02:15:05,550
l'm never alone. Never.

1162
02:15:05,750 --> 02:15:09,870
Now what does this mirror do?

1163
02:15:11,430 --> 02:15:13,550
l see what l desire.

1164
02:15:14,110 --> 02:15:18,550
l see myself holding the Stone.
But how do l get it?

1165
02:15:18,750 --> 02:15:20,910
Use the boy.

1166
02:15:21,710 --> 02:15:25,630
Come here Potter! Now!

1167
02:15:37,710 --> 02:15:41,710
Tell me what do you see?

1168
02:16:06,870 --> 02:16:09,270
What is it? What do you see?

1169
02:16:09,510 --> 02:16:14,670
l'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
l've won the house cup.

1170
02:16:14,870 --> 02:16:16,430
He lies.

1171
02:16:16,910 --> 02:16:20,630
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1172
02:16:20,830 --> 02:16:25,230
-Let me speak to him.
-Master you are not strong enough.

1173
02:16:25,470 --> 02:16:29,470
l have strength enough for this.

1174
02:16:47,670 --> 02:16:50,550
Harry Potter...

1175
02:16:50,750 --> 02:16:53,070
...we meet again.

1176
02:16:53,310 --> 02:16:54,710
Voldemort.

1177
02:16:54,910 --> 02:16:58,870
Yes. You see what l've become?

1178
02:16:59,150 --> 02:17:02,710
See what l must do to survive?

1179
02:17:02,910 --> 02:17:07,070
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1180
02:17:07,710 --> 02:17:11,070
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1181
02:17:11,270 --> 02:17:14,950
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1182
02:17:15,150 --> 02:17:18,710
But there is something that can.

1183
02:17:18,910 --> 02:17:24,590
Something that conveniently enough
lies in your pocket.

1184
02:17:24,950 --> 02:17:26,510
Stop him!

1185
02:17:31,550 --> 02:17:34,310
Don't be a fool.

1186
02:17:34,790 --> 02:17:37,910
Why suffer an horrific death...

1187
02:17:38,110 --> 02:17:41,750
...when you can join me and live?

1188
02:17:41,950 --> 02:17:43,030
Never!

1189
02:17:45,070 --> 02:17:49,830
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1190
02:17:50,590 --> 02:17:53,910
Tell me Harry...

1191
02:17:54,150 --> 02:17:58,030
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1192
02:17:58,270 --> 02:18:00,350
Together...

1193
02:18:00,550 --> 02:18:03,110
...we can bring them back.

1194
02:18:03,510 --> 02:18:08,230
All l ask is for something in return.

1195
02:18:14,950 --> 02:18:18,070
That's it Harry.

1196
02:18:18,950 --> 02:18:22,830
There is no good and evil.

1197
02:18:23,030 --> 02:18:26,070
There is only power...

1198
02:18:26,270 --> 02:18:30,390
...and those too weak to seek it.

1199
02:18:31,070 --> 02:18:36,110
Together we'll do
extraordinary things.

1200
02:18:36,510 --> 02:18:38,790
Just give me the Stone!

1201
02:18:41,390 --> 02:18:42,550
You liar!

1202
02:18:42,790 --> 02:18:44,910
Kill him!

1203
02:19:08,430 --> 02:19:13,750
-What is this magic?
-Fool get the Stone!

1204
02:20:59,030 --> 02:21:01,550
Good afternoon Harry.

1205
02:21:03,670 --> 02:21:08,190
-Tokens from your admirers?
-Admirers?

1206
02:21:08,390 --> 02:21:14,390
What happened down in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret.

1207
02:21:14,590 --> 02:21:19,390
So naturally the whole school knows.

1208
02:21:21,710 --> 02:21:25,350
l see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1209
02:21:25,550 --> 02:21:28,390
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1210
02:21:28,590 --> 02:21:31,630
Ron was here? ls he all right?
What about Hermione?

1211
02:21:31,830 --> 02:21:36,710
Fine. They're both just fine.

1212
02:21:37,270 --> 02:21:40,070
-What happened to the Stone?
-Relax dear boy.

1213
02:21:40,430 --> 02:21:43,230
The Stone has been destroyed.

1214
02:21:43,510 --> 02:21:47,410
My friend Nicholas and l
have had a little chat...

1215
02:21:47,510 --> 02:21:51,870
...and agreed it was best all around.

1216
02:21:52,110 --> 02:21:55,910
But then Flamel
he'll die won't he?

1217
02:21:57,990 --> 02:22:03,470
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1218
02:22:03,670 --> 02:22:06,910
But yes he will die.

1219
02:22:07,110 --> 02:22:09,550
How is it l got the Stone sir?

1220
02:22:09,790 --> 02:22:12,310
One minute l was staring
in the mirror and the next--

1221
02:22:12,510 --> 02:22:16,630
You see only a person...

1222
02:22:16,910 --> 02:22:20,830
...who wanted to find the Stone
find it...

1223
02:22:21,070 --> 02:22:25,630
...but not use it
would be able to get it.

1224
02:22:26,590 --> 02:22:30,070
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1225
02:22:30,310 --> 02:22:35,350
And between you and me
that is saying something.

1226
02:22:36,790 --> 02:22:42,030
Does that mean with the Stone gone that is
that Voldemort can never come back?

1227
02:22:42,230 --> 02:22:44,550
l'm afraid...

1228
02:22:45,990 --> 02:22:50,030
...there are ways
in which he can return.

1229
02:22:50,750 --> 02:22:53,310
Harry do you know why...

1230
02:22:53,510 --> 02:22:57,550
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1231
02:22:57,750 --> 02:23:02,390
lt was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1232
02:23:02,910 --> 02:23:06,110
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1233
02:23:06,350 --> 02:23:10,110
No this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1234
02:23:10,350 --> 02:23:15,270
-lt lives in your very skin.
-What is it?

1235
02:23:16,110 --> 02:23:19,830
Love Harry. Love.

1236
02:23:27,910 --> 02:23:32,030
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1237
02:23:32,230 --> 02:23:36,910
l was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1238
02:23:37,150 --> 02:23:40,430
And since then l'm afraid
l've lost my liking for them.

1239
02:23:40,670 --> 02:23:44,030
But l think l could be safe...

1240
02:23:44,230 --> 02:23:46,630
...with a nice toffee.

1241
02:23:50,710 --> 02:23:52,270
Alas!

1242
02:23:52,950 --> 02:23:55,070
Earwax.

1243
02:24:10,310 --> 02:24:13,470
-All right there Ron?
-All right. You?

1244
02:24:14,590 --> 02:24:17,310
All right. Hermione?

1245
02:24:17,990 --> 02:24:19,830
Never better.

1246
02:24:35,630 --> 02:24:38,070
Another year gone.

1247
02:24:38,830 --> 02:24:43,390
And now as l understand it
the house cup needs awarding.

1248
02:24:43,590 --> 02:24:46,230
And the points stand thus:

1249
02:24:46,430 --> 02:24:52,230
ln fourth place
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1250
02:24:54,190 --> 02:24:59,870
Third place
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1251
02:25:05,150 --> 02:25:06,950
ln second place...

1252
02:25:07,150 --> 02:25:11,950
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1253
02:25:17,630 --> 02:25:19,350
And in first place...

1254
02:25:19,670 --> 02:25:25,110
...with 472 points Slytherin house.

1255
02:25:30,670 --> 02:25:32,910
Nice one mate.

1256
02:25:36,750 --> 02:25:40,800
Yes yes well done Slytherin.
Well done Slytherin.

1257
02:25:40,850 --> 02:25:45,350
However recent events must
be taken into account.

1258
02:25:45,590 --> 02:25:50,550
And l have a few last-minute points
to award.

1259
02:25:51,150 --> 02:25:56,670
To Miss Hermione Granger
for the cool use of intellect...

1260
02:25:56,870 --> 02:25:59,670
...while others were in grave peril...

1261
02:26:00,390 --> 02:26:02,630
...50 points.

1262
02:26:03,550 --> 02:26:04,830
Good job.

1263
02:26:12,550 --> 02:26:18,590
Second to Mr. Ronald Weasley
for the best-played game of chess...

1264
02:26:19,110 --> 02:26:24,350
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years 50 points.

1265
02:26:28,990 --> 02:26:31,030
And third...

1266
02:26:31,590 --> 02:26:34,470
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1267
02:26:34,670 --> 02:26:38,950
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1268
02:26:39,550 --> 02:26:44,430
...l award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1269
02:26:52,710 --> 02:26:54,630
We're tied with Slytherin!

1270
02:26:54,870 --> 02:27:00,870
Finally it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1271
02:27:01,070 --> 02:27:04,950
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1272
02:27:05,150 --> 02:27:08,110
l award 10 points...

1273
02:27:08,310 --> 02:27:11,550
...to Neville Longbottom.

1274
02:27:24,870 --> 02:27:28,310
Assuming that my calculations
are correct l believe...

1275
02:27:28,510 --> 02:27:33,070
...that a change
of decoration is in order.

1276
02:27:38,110 --> 02:27:41,470
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1277
02:28:19,510 --> 02:28:22,870
Come on now.
Hurry up you'll be late.

1278
02:28:23,070 --> 02:28:27,350
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on hurry up.

1279
02:28:32,790 --> 02:28:36,070
-Come on Harry.
-One minute.

1280
02:28:42,350 --> 02:28:46,070
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye did you?

1281
02:28:49,310 --> 02:28:51,150
This is for you.

1282
02:29:07,910 --> 02:29:10,030
Thanks Hagrid.

1283
02:29:15,870 --> 02:29:20,270
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh listen Harry.

1284
02:29:20,710 --> 02:29:25,150
lf that dolt of a cousin of yours
Dudley gives you any grief...

1285
02:29:25,430 --> 02:29:28,070
...you could always threaten him...

1286
02:29:28,310 --> 02:29:31,190
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with that tail of his.

1287
02:29:31,390 --> 02:29:36,470
But Hagrid we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1288
02:29:36,950 --> 02:29:41,270
l do. But your cousin don't do he?

1289
02:29:46,790 --> 02:29:49,910
Feels strange to be going home
doesn't it?

1290
02:29:50,110 --> 02:29:52,190
l'm not going home.

1291
02:29:52,390 --> 02:29:54,310
Not really.
