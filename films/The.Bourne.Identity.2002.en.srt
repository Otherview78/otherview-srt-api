00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:48,503
MEDITERRANEAN SEA
60 MILES SOUTH OF MARSEILLE

2
00:01:55,965 --> 00:01:57,365
What a mess.

3
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,090
You've never seen a dead man before?

4
00:02:08,237 --> 00:02:09,937
Put a blanket on him. Cover him.

5
00:02:10,105 --> 00:02:11,470
I'm coming.

6
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:13,408
Be careful.

7
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,333
One minute. I'll be right there. Cover him.

8
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,977
What the hell
are you doing to me?

9
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,745
What are you doing?

10
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:04,218
Goddamn it! Where am I?
A boat.

11
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:06,755
A fishing boat.
You were in the water.

12
00:05:06,824 --> 00:05:09,793
We pull you out.
What water?

13
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,124
You were shot.
See? There are the bullets.

14
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:16,428
Ohh. Look. There is
a number for a bank.

15
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:18,992
Why was it in your hip?

16
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:20,629
My hip?
Why was it in your hip?

17
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:24,664
Yeah. In your hip
under the skin.
Uh. Oh, God!

18
00:05:24,744 --> 00:05:28,942
You need to rest.
Wait. Please. Slow down.

19
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:33,645
I'm a friend.
I'm your friend. Huh?

20
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,315
My name is Giancarlo.
Who are you?

21
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:42,193
What's your name?
What's your name?

22
00:05:42,263 --> 00:05:44,322
Uh, I don't know.

23
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:49,059
<i>Oh, God.</i>

24
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,860
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
LANGLEY, VIRGINIA

25
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,534
It's been confirmed, sir.
Mission failed.

26
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:04,951
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>

27
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:09,569
<i>I do not know who I am.</i>

28
00:07:15,577 --> 00:07:16,977
Tell me who I am.

29
00:07:19,014 --> 00:07:20,641
If you know who I am...

30
00:07:21,683 --> 00:07:24,083
Please stop messing around...

31
00:07:24,786 --> 00:07:26,346
...and tell me.

32
00:07:38,393 --> 00:07:40,327
If you want to eat,
you better get in there.

33
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:44,058
<i>Based on these charts, I think
I may have been closer to the coast.</i>

34
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:46,828
What's this?
You tied these knots?

35
00:07:46,903 --> 00:07:48,871
So it start
to come back, huh?

36
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:51,429
No, it doesn't start to come back.
The knot's like everything else.

37
00:07:51,507 --> 00:07:53,873
I just found the rope
and I did it.

38
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:56,742
The same way I can...
I can read, I can write.

39
00:07:56,814 --> 00:07:59,248
<i>I can add, subtract.
I can make coffee. I can shuffle cards.</i>

40
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:02,012
<i>I can set up a chessboard.
Yes, yes. It will come back.</i>

41
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:04,419
No, it's not coming back,
goddamn it! That's the point!

42
00:08:06,124 --> 00:08:10,083
I'm down here
looking through all this shit.
For two weeks I'm down here.

43
00:08:10,162 --> 00:08:12,892
It's not working. I don't
even know what to look for.

44
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:19,264
You need to rest.

45
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:22,604
<i>It will come back.
What if it doesn't come back?</i>

46
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:28,612
We get in there tomorrow,
I-I don't even have a name.

47
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:03,450
It's not much,
but it should get you
to Switzerland.

48
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:09,083
Thank you.

49
00:10:46,236 --> 00:10:48,227
<i>Hey.</i>

50
00:10:48,657 --> 00:10:50,557
<i>Can't you read the signs?</i>

51
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,615
<i>On your feet...let's go...right now.</i>

52
00:10:53,628 --> 00:10:55,628
<i>The park is closed.
There's no sleeping in the park.</i>

53
00:10:55,814 --> 00:10:57,475
All right.

54
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,133
<i>Let's see some identification.</i>

55
00:11:00,353 --> 00:11:02,278
No. I-I don't...

56
00:11:02,503 --> 00:11:03,054
<i>Come on...your papers.</i>

57
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:05,714
I don't have any papers.
I lost...

58
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:07,439
<i>I've lost them...my papers...they are lost.</i>

59
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,879
<i>Ok...let's go...put your hands up.</i>

60
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:15,916
<i>...I just need to sleep...</i>

61
00:11:38,762 --> 00:11:41,925
These people have threatened
my family, my babies.

62
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:44,763
<i>So I'm telling you,
when the evidence is clear...</i>

63
00:11:44,835 --> 00:11:47,065
<i>I will have a nice story
for you to read about.</i>

64
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:50,403
And all my friends out there,
you will read about yourselves.

65
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:52,500
<i>'Cause if you want
to play this game...</i>

66
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:55,569
after I've been reasonable,
I will show you.

67
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:59,880
That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking
in Paris the day before yesterday.

68
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:02,216
He was an irritation
before he took power...

69
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:06,088
<i>he was a problem when
he was in power and he's been
a disaster for us in exile.</i>

70
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,255
He's writing a book about
the agency's history in Africa.
He's going to name names.

71
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,265
<i>It's basically a shakedown.
He's demanding the agency's help.</i>

72
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:17,464
He wants us to put him back
in power in six months or else.

73
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:21,305
This interview, and I'll
make the tape available
to anyone who wants it...

74
00:12:21,377 --> 00:12:24,574
he goes on to claim
that he's just survived
an assassination attempt.

75
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:28,442
<i>He says it's us.
He says he's got proof.</i>

76
00:12:30,153 --> 00:12:34,613
The director wants to know
if there's any possible shred of truth
in this accusation.

77
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:38,889
<i>I've already assured him
there's nobody that reckless
on my senior staff.</i>

78
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,239
I was recalling a conversation
we had some time ago,
talking about Treadstone.

79
00:12:50,309 --> 00:12:53,938
I seem to remember
Nykwana Wombosi's name
might have come up.

80
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:57,582
I'm not sure
what we're talking about.

81
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:02,519
Someone tried to take him out.
Tried and failed.

82
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:06,015
Was this Treadstone?

83
00:13:06,093 --> 00:13:08,994
You're asking me
a direct question?

84
00:13:09,063 --> 00:13:12,430
Yes.
I thought you were
never gonna do that.

85
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,128
What happened?

86
00:13:15,203 --> 00:13:21,005
Well, we, uh, lost
communication with our man.

87
00:13:21,077 --> 00:13:23,068
This was almost
two weeks ago.

88
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:25,705
<i>We've been working
around the clock, the whole unit.</i>

89
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:28,750
We've been sleeping down there.
Believe me, we're doing
everything we can.

90
00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:32,721
<i>And you don't
let me know this?
You never wanted to before.</i>

91
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:35,656
You never made
a mistake before.

92
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:47,238
GEMEINSCHAFT BANK

93
00:14:06,855 --> 00:14:08,584
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

94
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:13,557
Uh, yes. I'm here about
a numbered account.

95
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:17,230
If you just enter your account
number here, I'll direct you
to an appropriate officer.

96
00:16:18,408 --> 00:16:20,638
My name is Jason Bourne.

97
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:29,378
<i>I live in Paris.</i>

98
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,948
I'm trying to think...

99
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:07,419
How long's it been since I was here last?

100
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:08,925
I'm not sure.

101
00:18:09,264 --> 00:18:11,364
It must be three weeks.

102
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:29,910
<i>Yes. In Paris. Do you have
the number for a Jason Bourne?</i>

103
00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:33,949
Yes, sir. Would you
like me to connect you?

104
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:36,494
Yes. Please.

105
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:43,635
This is 4-6-9-9-0-3-8-4.

106
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,639
<i>Leave a message at the beep.</i>

107
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:53,005
I'm an American.
Okay.

108
00:19:54,116 --> 00:19:56,277
Hold it. Wait.

109
00:19:56,352 --> 00:19:58,650
You have no jurisdiction here.

110
00:20:04,227 --> 00:20:07,594
<i>No. Excuse me. No. This is
not my current address, okay?</i>

111
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,599
This was my current address
until two days ago...

112
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,897
when I started standing
in line outside.

113
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:17,066
Now, I lose my apartment,
okay? That means no address,
no phone, no money, no time.

114
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:20,908
<i>- I still have no visa.
- Miss Kreutz, I'm gonna have to
ask you to keep your voice down.</i>

115
00:20:20,979 --> 00:20:24,972
<i>Excuse me. But where's the guy
that I talked to last week?</i>

116
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:27,485
Every week it's a new person.
How am I supposed to...

117
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:30,546
I don't know
who you saw last week.
Well, let me help you.

118
00:20:30,623 --> 00:20:34,354
<i>- I'm sure I have it. Hold on.
- Could I have your attention
for a moment, please?</i>

119
00:20:34,428 --> 00:20:36,623
<i>It's right here. Look at it.</i>

120
00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:44,204
This is a student visa now.
It's not about a green card anymore.

121
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:47,969
<i>- It's completely different.
- It's not a menu, Miss Kreutz.</i>

122
00:20:48,043 --> 00:20:50,034
<i>You dont just
pick what you want.</i>

123
00:20:58,922 --> 00:21:02,449
You! Red bag! The red bag!
Stop right there!

124
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:04,460
<i>Put your hands up!</i>

125
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,938
I'm on the east... Ohh!

126
00:21:49,412 --> 00:21:52,176
<i>Move it! Now! Now!</i>

127
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:12,796
Check. Clear!

128
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:16,239
<i>Bravo Unit moving up staircase.
Proceeding to second floor.</i>

129
00:22:40,703 --> 00:22:43,831
<i>On the floor! Down!</i>

130
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:45,567
<i>Clear!</i>

131
00:24:11,137 --> 00:24:12,866
<i>Go! Go! Come on!</i>

132
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:22,673
He's in Zurich now?
Right now?
Yes. It just came in.

133
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,980
But they're sure?
Sure it's him?
Yes. He went to the bank.

134
00:25:25,053 --> 00:25:26,987
Our source at the bank,
that's who called.

135
00:25:27,055 --> 00:25:30,081
- Come on.
- He's got to assume we're
watching the bank, right?

136
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,923
I don't know. Come on.

137
00:25:32,996 --> 00:25:36,193
I mean, he cleaned out
the box. He left the gun.
What does that mean?

138
00:25:36,266 --> 00:25:38,200
I said I don't know.

139
00:25:38,268 --> 00:25:40,793
I liked it better
when I thought he was dead.

140
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,040
<i>Oh, Scheiße.</i>

141
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,158
What are you looking at?

142
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,819
I heard you inside.
What?

143
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:05,523
The consulate. I heard
you talking. I thought maybe
we could help each other.

144
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,501
<i>How's that?
You need money.
I need a ride out of here.</i>

145
00:26:10,838 --> 00:26:12,772
I'm not running a car service
just now. Thank you.

146
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,468
I'll give you $10,000
for driving me to Paris.

147
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:18,981
<i>What, do you think I'm a fool?</i>

148
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,145
<i>You'd be a fool not to take it.</i>

149
00:26:23,752 --> 00:26:25,982
What is this, a joke?
Some kind of scam?

150
00:26:26,055 --> 00:26:28,455
<i>No, it's no scam.</i>

151
00:26:28,524 --> 00:26:30,583
<i>And I'll give you another ten
when we get there.</i>

152
00:26:31,628 --> 00:26:33,960
Jesus.

153
00:26:39,237 --> 00:26:42,604
<i>- Is that for you?
- Look. You drive, I pay.
It's that simple.</i>

154
00:26:45,643 --> 00:26:48,635
<i>Scheiße.
I got enough trouble, okay?</i>

155
00:26:49,715 --> 00:26:52,047
<i>Okay. Can I have
my money back?</i>

156
00:27:08,068 --> 00:27:12,698
<i>All right, go.
Keep going. Go.</i>

157
00:27:12,774 --> 00:27:15,436
<i>There. Wait.
No. It's
got to be near the end.</i>

158
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,035
Oh, come on, folks.
We caught a break here. Let's go.

159
00:27:18,113 --> 00:27:22,743
Okay, I'm up.
We're getting grids.
Airline, train, hotels...

160
00:27:22,818 --> 00:27:25,048
Did you get the address?
The street?
Gemeinschaft.

161
00:27:25,121 --> 00:27:27,555
<i>- Here we go.
- I got it. I think I got it.</i>

162
00:27:27,623 --> 00:27:30,649
<i>Is it him?
Unreal.</i>

163
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:32,820
This is 38 minutes ago.

164
00:27:32,896 --> 00:27:35,922
<i>Hey, Zurich police are looking
for an American man carrying
a red bank bag.</i>

165
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:39,127
<i>He just tore up the embassy,
and he put two cops
in the hospital last night.</i>

166
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:45,103
Get everybody up. Do it now.
I want them all activated.

167
00:27:45,176 --> 00:27:47,110
All of them?
At the same time?

168
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:51,809
You heard me. I want Bourne
in a body bag by sundown.

169
00:27:51,884 --> 00:27:56,184
Let's get a map up here.
Come on, folks. Work it.

170
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:00,916
Take a look.
The grids are good info.

171
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:20,642
<i>Which was fine for me,
because I was ready.</i>

172
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,242
<i>You know, because, I mean,
after six months in Amsterdam...</i>

173
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:26,516
<i>you're not sure if you've been
there 20 minutes or 20 years,
if you know what I mean.</i>

174
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,751
So I went and I took
all the money I had...

175
00:29:28,826 --> 00:29:32,785
and I went in with friends
and we took over this really
cool surf shop outside Biarritz...

176
00:29:32,863 --> 00:29:36,230
um, which was
right by the water;
it was amazing.

177
00:29:36,301 --> 00:29:38,826
It was just amazing
for about three months...

178
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:42,863
until it turned out
that this, uh, jerk who
had found us the lease...

179
00:29:42,942 --> 00:29:47,936
was actually shining
everyone on and...

180
00:29:52,152 --> 00:29:54,143
And what?

181
00:29:55,255 --> 00:29:57,189
What do you mean what?
Listen to me.

182
00:29:57,257 --> 00:29:59,817
I've been speed-talking
for about 60 kilometers now.

183
00:29:59,894 --> 00:30:03,091
I talk when I'm nervous.
I mean, I talk like this
when I'm nervous.

184
00:30:03,164 --> 00:30:05,655
I'm gonna shut up now.
No. Don't do that.

185
00:30:07,336 --> 00:30:09,804
I haven't talked
to anybody in a while.

186
00:30:11,006 --> 00:30:13,531
Yeah, but we're not talking.
I'm talking.

187
00:30:13,609 --> 00:30:15,839
You've said, like, ten words
since we left Zurich.

188
00:30:15,912 --> 00:30:18,972
Well, listening to you,
um, it's relaxing.

189
00:30:21,785 --> 00:30:23,980
I haven't slept
in a while and...

190
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:27,149
and I've had this headache.

191
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,159
It's like a constant thing
inside my head.

192
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:31,627
And it's just starting
to move to the background, so...

193
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,626
keep going.

194
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,760
Really. If you want,
please keep talking.

195
00:30:40,607 --> 00:30:42,598
Okay.

196
00:30:43,643 --> 00:30:45,611
What kind of music
do you like?

197
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,607
Huh? What do you like?
Come on.
Um...

198
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:54,518
You know what, never mind.
No. It's fine. Tell me.

199
00:30:54,588 --> 00:30:57,056
<i>What do you want
to listen to?</i>

200
00:30:57,125 --> 00:31:00,561
I don't know.
Come on.
It's not that hard.

201
00:31:00,629 --> 00:31:02,756
What do you like?
Tell me.

202
00:31:02,831 --> 00:31:04,822
<i>I don't know.</i>

203
00:31:14,711 --> 00:31:17,305
Who pays $20,000
for a ride to Paris?

204
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:33,063
Fuck it. I can't remember anything
that happened before two weeks ago.

205
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:36,558
Lucky you.
No. I'm serious.

206
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:41,538
I don't know who I am.
I don't know where I'm going.
None of it.

207
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:45,169
What, like, amnesia?
Yes.

208
00:31:47,315 --> 00:31:49,408
Amnesia?
Yes.

209
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:55,312
Great.

210
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:05,526
- That's the best angle of the courtyard?
- That's the only angle.

211
00:32:05,602 --> 00:32:08,469
<i>Well, what do they have
of the streets or the area?</i>

212
00:32:08,538 --> 00:32:10,631
They must
have something.
Hang on.

213
00:32:12,977 --> 00:32:15,104
Oh, what is he doing?

214
00:32:16,513 --> 00:32:19,505
Is it a game?
Is he warning us? Is it a threat?

215
00:32:20,785 --> 00:32:22,776
Sir, look at this.

216
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:27,252
What's that?
It's an angle of the street.
It's some sort of alley.

217
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:31,557
<i>Just enhance it.</i>

218
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:37,231
Who the hell is that?

219
00:32:37,304 --> 00:32:40,034
<i>Marie Helena Kreutz.</i>

220
00:32:40,107 --> 00:32:42,234
She's 26.
Born outside of Hannover.

221
00:32:42,309 --> 00:32:44,743
Father was a welder.
He died in '87.

222
00:32:44,811 --> 00:32:46,608
<i>Still don't have the mother.</i>

223
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:48,740
The grandmother,
she's still there in Hannover...

224
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:52,081
and looks like
she's the anchor for this
little domestic disaster.

225
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:56,112
<i>And there's a stepbrother.
It's tough. The girl's a gypsy.</i>

226
00:32:56,191 --> 00:33:00,457
She pops up on the grid
here and there,
but it's chaotic at best.

227
00:33:00,529 --> 00:33:03,054
<i>She paid some electric bills
in Spain, '95...</i>

228
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:07,126
<i>had a phone in her name for
three months in Belgium, '96.</i>

229
00:33:07,203 --> 00:33:09,330
<i>No taxes, no credit.</i>

230
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:12,898
I don't like her.
I want to go deep.

231
00:33:12,977 --> 00:33:15,810
Get a phone log for granny
and the half brother...

232
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,178
anybody we can cross-file.

233
00:33:18,249 --> 00:33:21,616
<i>I want to know every place
she's slept in the past six years.</i>

234
00:33:21,687 --> 00:33:24,588
Have Paris get these
out in the field.

235
00:33:27,247 --> 00:33:29,517
TREADSTONE SAFE HOUSE
PARIS, FRANCE

236
00:33:53,189 --> 00:33:55,419
<i>I'm not making this up.</i>

237
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,823
These are real.

238
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:08,331
Okay.
Who has a safety
deposit box full of...

239
00:34:11,242 --> 00:34:13,437
money and six passports
and a gun?

240
00:34:16,147 --> 00:34:19,207
Who has a bank account number
in their hip?

241
00:34:20,352 --> 00:34:22,320
I come in here...

242
00:34:22,388 --> 00:34:26,154
and the first thing I'm doing
is I'm catching the sight lines
and looking for an exit.

243
00:34:26,226 --> 00:34:28,319
I see the exit sign too.
I'm not worried.

244
00:34:28,395 --> 00:34:30,727
I mean, you were shot.

245
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:35,234
People do all kinds
of weird and amazing stuff
when they're scared.

246
00:34:40,941 --> 00:34:44,274
I can tell you
the license plate numbers
of all six cars outside.

247
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,414
I can tell that
our waitress is left-handed...

248
00:34:47,482 --> 00:34:51,851
and the guy sitting up at
the counter weighs 215 pounds
and knows how to handle himself.

249
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:55,516
<i>I know the best place
to look for a gun is the cab
of the gray truck outside.</i>

250
00:34:55,591 --> 00:35:00,392
And at this altitude, I can
run flat-out for a half mile
before my hands start shaking.

251
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,360
Now why would I know that?

252
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:11,365
How can I know that
and not know who I am?

253
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:55,257
Hey.

254
00:35:56,526 --> 00:35:58,517
Ah, I slept.

255
00:35:59,997 --> 00:36:02,488
I can't believe it.
Yeah. Well, you were tired.

256
00:36:02,566 --> 00:36:07,333
I haven't slept.
Oh. Here. For 20,000,
I like to throw in breakfast.

257
00:36:09,474 --> 00:36:11,408
Did you stop for gas?

258
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,241
You were
pretty out of it.

259
00:36:16,315 --> 00:36:18,783
Yeah.
Ohh.

260
00:36:20,953 --> 00:36:25,117
So, do you think there's,
like, a family waiting for you?

261
00:36:26,793 --> 00:36:28,784
I don't know.

262
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,526
I haven't thought about it.

263
00:36:40,009 --> 00:36:41,943
<i>Is that it?</i>

264
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:44,741
104. Yeah, that's it.
That's the address.

265
00:36:44,813 --> 00:36:47,475
No, no. Keep going.
Keep going.
Okay.

266
00:36:47,551 --> 00:36:50,281
Where?
Just, uh, just take a left.
Go on over here.

267
00:37:05,571 --> 00:37:08,904
So this is it, right?
Yeah. I guess.

268
00:37:10,943 --> 00:37:13,810
Yeah, but I don't
recognize any of this.

269
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,871
Okay. You should go.

270
00:37:20,053 --> 00:37:22,578
Jason.

271
00:37:23,657 --> 00:37:26,182
Oh, God. Money. Right.

272
00:37:27,194 --> 00:37:30,322
Yeah.
Here.

273
00:37:30,398 --> 00:37:32,764
<i>Danke, okay?</i>

274
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,268
Thanks for the ride.

275
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:37,328
Anytime.

276
00:37:43,145 --> 00:37:45,943
Well, you could come up
and you can...
Or you could wait here.

277
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:50,453
I can go check it out,
but you could wait...
Uh, no, no. No, no.

278
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,924
Um, with you, you would
probably just forget
about me if I stayed here.

279
00:37:57,996 --> 00:38:01,022
How could I forget about you?

280
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:03,033
You're the only person I know.

281
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:10,433
Yeah. That's true.

282
00:38:24,759 --> 00:38:26,750
I guess you're not home.

283
00:38:34,692 --> 00:38:36,972
<i>Monsieur Bourne, there you are.</i>

284
00:38:38,558 --> 00:38:42,658
<i>Monsieur Bourne, I was wondering--
I haven't seen you.</i>

285
00:38:43,162 --> 00:38:44,282
<i>Uh, here I am.</i>

286
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,099
<i>I think I forgot my key.</i>

287
00:39:03,135 --> 00:39:05,126
Hello?

288
00:39:23,858 --> 00:39:26,827
You sure this is all yours?

289
00:39:26,895 --> 00:39:30,797
<i>I guess.</i>

290
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:52,647
This is my kitchen.

291
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:14,276
<i>- Any clues?
- I think I'm in the shipping business.</i>

292
00:40:14,348 --> 00:40:16,339
So it's all coming back, huh?

293
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:25,118
Do you mind
if I use the bathroom?

294
00:40:26,595 --> 00:40:29,758
- Uh, sure.
- Okay.

295
00:40:53,725 --> 00:40:56,455
Uh, yeah. Hello? Hello?

296
00:40:56,528 --> 00:41:00,225
Yes, sir.
Hotel Regina, Paris.
How may I direct your call?

297
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,928
<i>Yeah. You're in Paris?
Yes, sir.</i>

298
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,062
I'm looking for
a, uh, guest there.

299
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,405
Uh, Jason Bourne.
One moment, please.

300
00:41:09,477 --> 00:41:11,468
Thank you.

301
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:18,519
I'm afraid I have no one
by that name registered, sir.

302
00:41:20,322 --> 00:41:22,756
Uh, okay. Uh, thank you.

303
00:41:22,825 --> 00:41:26,158
Uh, wait. No, no, no.
Uh, are you there? Hello?
Sir?

304
00:41:26,229 --> 00:41:29,164
Uh, can you check another,
uh, name for me, please?

305
00:41:29,232 --> 00:41:31,097
Uh, bear with me one second.

306
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:34,837
Um...

307
00:41:34,905 --> 00:41:37,601
uh, John Michael Kane.
Kane with a "K."

308
00:41:37,674 --> 00:41:39,835
One moment, sir.
Thank you.

309
00:41:48,687 --> 00:41:52,054
You call about Monsieur Kane?
John Michael Kane?

310
00:41:52,124 --> 00:41:55,560
Uh, yeah. That's right.
You are a friend of his?

311
00:41:55,629 --> 00:41:58,462
Uh, uh-huh. Yep.

312
00:41:58,532 --> 00:42:00,762
I have some very
bad news for you, sir.

313
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:02,802
I'm terribly sorry
to tell you this...

314
00:42:02,869 --> 00:42:06,600
but Monsieur Kane
has passed away
almost two weeks ago.

315
00:42:06,674 --> 00:42:09,541
There was an accident
on the motorway.

316
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,170
Apparently,
he was killed instantly.

317
00:42:12,247 --> 00:42:14,977
Really. I'm terribly sorry
to be the one to tell you this.

318
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,849
When they came for his things,
people made note for us, you see?

319
00:42:20,924 --> 00:42:24,052
- Who-Who came?
- His brother.

320
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:28,029
Did his, uh, brother leave
a number or a way to get
in touch with him?

321
00:42:28,097 --> 00:42:30,497
I think not.

322
00:42:30,568 --> 00:42:33,036
So I'm sorry...

323
00:42:53,726 --> 00:42:56,422
<i>Uh, Jason?</i>

324
00:42:56,496 --> 00:42:59,465
<i>There's no hot water.
It's freezing.</i>

325
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:02,661
Uh, I'll go, uh, try
the water in the kitchen.

326
00:43:02,737 --> 00:43:06,764
Why don't you just stay
in the bathroom? I'll-I'll
see if I can... get it hot.

327
00:43:10,846 --> 00:43:13,076
Yeah, it's really
cold in here too.

328
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,124
<i>The water is still cold.</i>

329
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:30,056
Yeah, it's cold
in the, uh, kitchen too.

330
00:43:30,134 --> 00:43:32,500
I got it running though.

331
00:43:34,538 --> 00:43:36,529
So...

332
00:43:42,781 --> 00:43:44,772
What?

333
00:43:46,653 --> 00:43:49,645
Nothing.

334
00:43:49,722 --> 00:43:53,351
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

335
00:44:07,142 --> 00:44:11,044
<i>What is it?
Something wrong?</i>

336
00:44:48,321 --> 00:44:49,549
Jason!

337
00:45:51,659 --> 00:45:54,992
<i>Open that! Open that!
Tell me what's inside. Who are you?</i>

338
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:58,789
Who are you?

339
00:46:00,335 --> 00:46:03,498
Who are you?

340
00:46:04,573 --> 00:46:06,973
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

341
00:46:07,043 --> 00:46:11,173
<i>Ohh.</i>

342
00:46:11,247 --> 00:46:13,613
<i>Answer me! Who are you?</i>

343
00:46:13,683 --> 00:46:15,480
- He's got my picture.
- All right. Just... stop.

344
00:46:15,553 --> 00:46:17,418
<i>No, no, no!</i>

345
00:46:17,488 --> 00:46:20,389
<i>I don't... How...
Where did you get this?
Stay there! Stay there!</i>

346
00:46:20,457 --> 00:46:22,584
How did you get my picture?
Marie, stay there. Come on.

347
00:46:22,661 --> 00:46:25,926
Where did you get this from?
How did you get...

348
00:46:25,997 --> 00:46:29,763
Don't do this. I'll do this.
You stay there. Stay there.

349
00:46:29,835 --> 00:46:31,496
But he...

350
00:46:45,953 --> 00:46:47,887
Where are your shoes?
Get your shoes.

351
00:46:47,956 --> 00:46:50,356
Sure. Yeah. Sure.

352
00:46:50,425 --> 00:46:53,690
Uh, he went out the window.
Why would someone do that?

353
00:46:53,761 --> 00:46:56,662
We can't stay here.
It's not safe.

354
00:46:56,732 --> 00:46:59,565
<i>Look, I can get us out of here,
but we got to go.
We got to go right now.</i>

355
00:47:02,771 --> 00:47:05,501
Okay. Look, uh, you could wait.

356
00:47:05,575 --> 00:47:08,135
You could wait
for the cops. It's okay.

357
00:47:08,211 --> 00:47:11,237
You just wait for them
to get here, but I can't.
I got to go.

358
00:47:11,314 --> 00:47:14,977
<i>Marie?</i>

359
00:47:17,688 --> 00:47:19,679
Marie?

360
00:47:26,131 --> 00:47:27,723
<i>Ohh! Ohh!
Quiet. Quiet.</i>

361
00:47:39,947 --> 00:47:42,916
<i>Don't look.</i>

362
00:47:55,097 --> 00:47:57,964
Code in.
Alpha 37509.

363
00:47:59,769 --> 00:48:01,999
Yeah?

364
00:48:08,245 --> 00:48:11,043
Hang on.
Bourne, he went to Paris.
He went to the apartment.

365
00:48:11,115 --> 00:48:14,744
We got him? Tell me.
He killed our man.

366
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:16,753
What? In the apartment?
Yeah.

367
00:48:16,821 --> 00:48:20,348
Well, you got to clean that up.
No, I can't clean it up.

368
00:48:20,426 --> 00:48:23,122
There's a body
in the streets.
So?

369
00:48:23,195 --> 00:48:25,129
There's police.
This is Paris.

370
00:48:25,197 --> 00:48:27,631
Put up the scanners.
Get as much radio
information as you can.

371
00:48:30,236 --> 00:48:35,071
Okay. You stay here. I'll go
find a place for this money.
I'll be back in ten minutes.

372
00:50:00,638 --> 00:50:02,868
Hey. I told you
to stay in the car.

373
00:50:07,846 --> 00:50:10,940
Jesus Christ.
I told you to stay in the car.

374
00:50:12,584 --> 00:50:15,178
I needed a drink.
I didn't think you would
come back anyway.

375
00:50:15,253 --> 00:50:17,721
You got to go to the cops.
Right now.

376
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:20,657
You got to go before
this gets any worse.
By myself?

377
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:24,321
It's gonna be okay.
Take my passport, okay?
You show this to them.

378
00:50:24,398 --> 00:50:26,389
You have that picture.
You have the 20,000.

379
00:50:26,467 --> 00:50:29,197
You tell them everything
that happened. Everything.
They're gonna believe you.

380
00:50:29,269 --> 00:50:31,294
<i>They have to believe you.</i>

381
00:50:34,676 --> 00:50:38,510
Marie, you can't just sit here.
It's not safe here.

382
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,208
<i>Safe? This is from
inside the embassy.</i>

383
00:50:41,283 --> 00:50:43,376
Who can do this?
This is from yesterday.
I-I don't know.

384
00:50:43,452 --> 00:50:45,386
<i>How can they even know
that we're together?</i>

385
00:50:45,454 --> 00:50:48,184
Look, I'm trying to do
the right thing for you, okay? Just...

386
00:50:48,257 --> 00:50:50,487
Try... How are you gonna
make this right...

387
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,586
by sending me there alone?
Do you think I want you
to go to the cops?

388
00:50:53,663 --> 00:50:55,631
You think that's good for me?
You want to go, fine.

389
00:50:55,699 --> 00:50:57,929
You go to the cops, I gotta run.
You tell them what happened.

390
00:50:58,002 --> 00:51:00,596
I don't know what happened!
I don't know who this guy was!

391
00:51:00,671 --> 00:51:03,435
I don't know about that picture!
I don't know who I am!

392
00:51:10,716 --> 00:51:13,412
Look, I'm... You're acting like
I'm trying to burn you here.

393
00:51:13,485 --> 00:51:17,046
- I'm just trying to do the right thing.
- Nobody does the right thing.

394
00:51:25,533 --> 00:51:28,764
Look, I can't
run with you. I can't...

395
00:51:30,638 --> 00:51:33,004
We run... I gotta live
like this. I gotta...

396
00:51:33,074 --> 00:51:35,167
I don't even know
who I'm hiding from.

397
00:51:35,243 --> 00:51:38,303
These people know who I am.
Now I gotta...

398
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,678
I gotta stay here.
I gotta figure this out.

399
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:42,775
So figure it out.

400
00:52:00,038 --> 00:52:02,632
You take care of this car?

401
00:52:02,707 --> 00:52:05,904
What do you mean?
Tires felt a little splashy
on the way over here.

402
00:52:06,979 --> 00:52:09,072
It pulls a little to the right.

403
00:52:30,672 --> 00:52:32,663
Last chance, Marie.

404
00:53:56,201 --> 00:53:58,260
So...
What?

405
00:53:58,337 --> 00:54:00,805
<i>Uh, we got a bump
coming up.</i>

406
00:54:33,976 --> 00:54:36,308
Turn your head away.
Turn your head away.

407
00:55:53,799 --> 00:55:57,235
Ohh!

408
00:56:47,693 --> 00:56:50,059
You can never
come back to this car.

409
00:56:50,129 --> 00:56:52,063
You understand?
Mm-hmm.

410
00:56:52,131 --> 00:56:56,067
Okay. We're gonna clean it out,
and I'll wipe it down
and we walk away.

411
00:56:56,136 --> 00:56:58,070
That's it. Okay.
Okay.

412
00:56:58,138 --> 00:57:01,835
And I'll find a place
for us to rest,
and I gotta think.

413
00:57:01,909 --> 00:57:04,400
Do you have a hat
or a scarf or something?
For my hair?

414
00:57:04,479 --> 00:57:06,572
Yeah. Just until
we can change it.

415
00:57:06,648 --> 00:57:09,082
Yeah. Sure. Okay.
Okay.

416
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:13,940
HOFFENMElN MORGUE - PARlS, FRANCE

417
00:57:16,258 --> 00:57:20,194
<i>Shh! Shush! Shh!
Hush up.</i>

418
00:57:20,262 --> 00:57:22,287
<i>Shh! Shh!</i>

419
00:57:26,503 --> 00:57:29,028
Monsieur Kane.
Monsieur Kane.

420
00:57:29,105 --> 00:57:31,300
Ah, Monsieur Kane.

421
00:57:47,794 --> 00:57:49,785
It's not him.

422
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:53,070
This man was not shot.

423
00:58:10,552 --> 00:58:14,989
<i>What do you have?</i>

424
00:58:15,057 --> 00:58:17,150
<i>Wombosi went to the morgue.</i>

425
00:58:17,226 --> 00:58:19,888
<i>He saw the body.
He didn't buy it.</i>

426
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,932
Where is he now?

427
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,628
<i>I told you I'm not staffed for this.</i>

428
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:27,897
<i>Where is he now?
Right now, where's Wombosi?</i>

429
00:58:27,972 --> 00:58:30,270
<i>They were leaving the morgue.
They just left.</i>

430
00:58:37,616 --> 00:58:39,607
Sir, what do you
want to do?

431
01:00:38,084 --> 01:00:40,609
I need to get that pile.

432
01:02:10,988 --> 01:02:12,979
<i>Hey.</i>

433
01:02:23,235 --> 01:02:25,897
You've already
cleaned the room?

434
01:02:25,971 --> 01:02:30,169
I wiped the whole place down
for fingerprints.

435
01:02:32,545 --> 01:02:36,447
Can I walk around,
or is that gonna leave
any footprints?

436
01:02:42,657 --> 01:02:45,353
You can... walk around.
It's no problem.

437
01:02:46,695 --> 01:02:49,630
<i>But we'll just keep track
of everything we touch.</i>

438
01:02:49,698 --> 01:02:53,099
I just think it's better
if we leave a room that we're
not gonna leave a trail.

439
01:02:53,168 --> 01:02:57,764
<i>Why? Where are we going?
I need to go to the hotel
where John Michael Kane stayed...</i>

440
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,774
the Hotel Regina.

441
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:02,310
Um, if I was him...

442
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:04,369
<i>then they're gonna have
some records.</i>

443
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:07,281
<i>We need that hotel bill.
Okay.</i>

444
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:09,649
It gets slightly
complicated though.

445
01:03:11,323 --> 01:03:13,314
Because you're dead.

446
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,827
<i>Right.</i>

447
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,927
<i>Sir, please.
They want war?</i>

448
01:03:23,002 --> 01:03:27,598
Then we will give them war.
If they want to kill me, they
better kill me the first time.

449
01:03:27,674 --> 01:03:29,608
They better kill me dead.

450
01:03:29,676 --> 01:03:32,611
<i>- They better kill me in my sleep.
- Nykwana, listen to me.</i>

451
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:36,240
We need these people.
It's hard enough getting
people we know to help us.

452
01:03:36,317 --> 01:03:39,684
We need
to be careful.
We?

453
01:03:39,754 --> 01:03:43,451
No, you.
You need to bring me back
that bastard Kane's head...

454
01:03:43,524 --> 01:03:47,858
put it in front of this house
and show them what kind of war
we are fighting.

455
01:04:07,618 --> 01:04:10,143
I want a reference check
before we go.

456
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:13,881
Okay.

457
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,394
What's the pay phone number?

458
01:04:17,462 --> 01:04:20,488
616-2468.

459
01:04:20,566 --> 01:04:23,296
Exits?
There's three.

460
01:04:23,369 --> 01:04:27,703
Service at the back,
um, side goes to the street
past the shops.

461
01:04:27,775 --> 01:04:29,709
Front is the best.

462
01:04:29,777 --> 01:04:33,577
If I think I'm being followed,
I walk out with the bag
over my right shoulder.

463
01:04:33,647 --> 01:04:36,548
And if there's no taxi?
I keep on walking...

464
01:04:36,618 --> 01:04:38,848
don't look back
until you make contact.

465
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:44,024
What?

466
01:04:47,063 --> 01:04:48,997
We need this, right?

467
01:04:50,934 --> 01:04:53,095
Okay.

468
01:05:04,015 --> 01:05:07,143
<i>I need distances.</i>

469
01:05:07,218 --> 01:05:10,051
<i>You walk in, you pick a spot...
some midpoint in the lobby.</i>

470
01:05:10,122 --> 01:05:12,989
<i>I want you to count
your steps to that spot
and then remember that number.</i>

471
01:05:13,025 --> 01:05:17,121
<i>Because after I call you,
I can get you moving.
You understand?</i>

472
01:05:17,197 --> 01:05:21,793
<i>I also need a head count
from the time you walk in
until you get to the desk.</i>

473
01:05:21,868 --> 01:05:24,769
<i>How many hotel employees are there?
And obviously security.</i>

474
01:05:24,839 --> 01:05:27,774
<i>And it might not be that
easy to see who they are.</i>

475
01:05:27,842 --> 01:05:31,141
<i>I'll call you.
You give me the layout.
We'll take it from there.</i>

476
01:05:36,972 --> 01:05:38,917
Yes, the house phone in the lobby.

477
01:05:57,742 --> 01:06:00,802
What happened?
Did something go wrong?

478
01:06:00,879 --> 01:06:03,973
I've got the records.

479
01:06:04,048 --> 01:06:06,608
This guy at the front desk
was smiling at me.

480
01:06:06,685 --> 01:06:09,916
I thought... all this trouble...
maybe it's easier to just ask for them.

481
01:06:09,989 --> 01:06:11,923
Do you have the bill?

482
01:06:11,991 --> 01:06:15,154
He made me a photocopy.

483
01:06:15,228 --> 01:06:18,061
You just asked for it?

484
01:06:18,131 --> 01:06:23,000
I said I was Mr. Kane's
personal assistant.

485
01:06:23,070 --> 01:06:25,004
Oh.

486
01:06:25,072 --> 01:06:29,031
Okay. Good thinking.

487
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:40,520
Reschedule a meeting...
Sir, can I...

488
01:06:43,493 --> 01:06:47,520
Wombosi was assassinated
in his house in the middle of Paris.

489
01:06:47,597 --> 01:06:49,531
Yeah, we just heard.

490
01:06:50,935 --> 01:06:53,529
<i>It's him. It's Bourne.
We're almost positive.</i>

491
01:06:53,604 --> 01:06:56,198
He had an assignment.
He failed.

492
01:06:56,274 --> 01:06:58,538
He obviously felt compelled
to finish the task.

493
01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:02,046
<i>Shit. Jesus.
We think he'll
come back in now.</i>

494
01:07:02,113 --> 01:07:06,675
I mean, it's routine.
It's like behavioral software.

495
01:07:08,221 --> 01:07:10,587
He's following a protocol.

496
01:07:10,656 --> 01:07:14,353
Now that he's completed the mission,
we think he'll come back in.

497
01:07:15,429 --> 01:07:18,227
<i>They always do.
When?</i>

498
01:07:19,466 --> 01:07:22,264
How long
till he checks in?

499
01:07:22,337 --> 01:07:24,271
Twenty-four hours.
Twenty-four hours?

500
01:07:24,339 --> 01:07:26,830
Yeah. It's usually
something like that.

501
01:07:27,909 --> 01:07:30,776
Then what?

502
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:33,041
I told you we'd clean this up.

503
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:35,276
It will be clean.

504
01:07:38,288 --> 01:07:42,748
<i>I understand you're a dive shop,
but where are you located?</i>

505
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:44,760
Marseille?

506
01:08:09,289 --> 01:08:13,453
What specifically
does your company supply?
I am sorry.

507
01:08:13,527 --> 01:08:15,620
<i>What did you say
your name was, monsieur?</i>

508
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:23,354
COP:

509
01:08:23,424 --> 01:08:26,924
You've been here for three hours
and you still can't find a print?

510
01:08:35,851 --> 01:08:37,842
What?
The Paris police
found the vehicle.

511
01:08:50,868 --> 01:08:53,530
<i>You've reached the office
of Simon Rawlins...</i>

512
01:08:53,605 --> 01:08:56,096
at Alliance Securite,
Maritime Division.

513
01:08:56,175 --> 01:08:59,770
The Paris office hours
are from 8:00 a.m. To 5:00 p.m.

514
01:08:59,845 --> 01:09:02,746
<i>I got a lead in Paris.</i>

515
01:09:02,816 --> 01:09:06,252
The rest were
Marseille and...
In Paris it's what?

516
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:09,117
Uh, Alliance Securite.
Simon Rawlins. I got a machine.

517
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,214
Monsieur.

518
01:09:33,282 --> 01:09:35,842
<i>Mr. Kane?</i>

519
01:09:35,919 --> 01:09:39,320
<i>Mr. Kane.</i>

520
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:42,757
How are you?
I'm good. I'm good.
How are you?

521
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:49,264
Oh, Mr. Kane.
Come right in.

522
01:09:49,334 --> 01:09:52,235
Please, have a seat.
Thank you.

523
01:09:52,304 --> 01:09:55,569
So, this is
the Palmer Johnson tri-deck.

524
01:09:55,641 --> 01:09:59,372
I'm assuming you're still in the market.
It's still the same vessel.

525
01:09:59,446 --> 01:10:01,710
Yes.

526
01:10:24,941 --> 01:10:26,875
So I'm Kane.

527
01:10:26,943 --> 01:10:28,934
Hey.
I just had
a meeting as Kane.

528
01:10:29,012 --> 01:10:32,311
They said...
No. I'm definitely Kane.
I just had a meeting as Kane.

529
01:10:32,382 --> 01:10:36,648
And he knew me as Kane.
So I'm definitely Bourne.
I'm also definitely Kane.

530
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:39,848
This is all just boats.
I got blueprints and cameras.

531
01:10:39,924 --> 01:10:43,325
I just found
John Michael Kane's body.

532
01:10:43,395 --> 01:10:45,625
In a morgue here in Paris.

533
01:10:45,697 --> 01:10:50,725
But if you are John Michael Kane,
whose body do they have?

534
01:10:58,045 --> 01:11:00,980
<i>What was name again?
Kane.</i>

535
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:03,209
Kane.
John Michael Kane.

536
01:11:03,283 --> 01:11:05,376
John Michael Kane.

537
01:11:10,225 --> 01:11:13,683
Kane.
It's number 121.

538
01:11:13,761 --> 01:11:16,594
- I want to see the body.
- Our boss could come back.

539
01:11:16,665 --> 01:11:19,691
I'm not supposed to do that.

540
01:11:19,768 --> 01:11:21,963
Come on.

541
01:11:36,254 --> 01:11:39,451
Is this it?
Wh-Where is he?

542
01:11:39,525 --> 01:11:41,891
I... I don't know where.

543
01:11:42,521 --> 01:11:43,221
What's going on?

544
01:11:43,519 --> 01:11:46,089
This guy has come to see the American.
But the body has disappeared.

545
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:47,924
They came yesterday evening...his brother.

546
01:11:48,062 --> 01:11:49,522
He's not in the register.

547
01:11:50,303 --> 01:11:53,067
Who are you?
What's going on here?
Where's the body?

548
01:11:53,139 --> 01:11:56,302
I said someone came last night.
I know.
Where'd they take the body?

549
01:11:56,377 --> 01:11:58,402
Look, this is not
a carnival, okay?

550
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:01,209
<i>People call,
they make an appointment
and they follow the rules.</i>

551
01:12:01,282 --> 01:12:04,513
Everyone signs in and out.
This is a serious place...
serious work.

552
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:08,682
It's not just to come in
whenever you like!
You're right. We didn't sign in.

553
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:10,691
<i>Get the hell out of here.</i>

554
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:14,058
Fine, fine.
I'm just gonna go sign in.
Go.

555
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,998
Is this it?
This is it, right?

556
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:22,299
You can't take the book.
It's okay.
There's a pencil in here.

557
01:12:22,372 --> 01:12:24,533
Honey, why don't you
go wait outside?

558
01:12:24,608 --> 01:12:27,805
Oh, here it is.
We cannot have...
Excuse me.

559
01:12:28,812 --> 01:12:31,372
Jason, what just
happened in there?

560
01:12:31,449 --> 01:12:33,940
What are you looking for?
Nykwana Wombosi.

561
01:12:34,018 --> 01:12:38,614
Wombosi went to the morgue
to visit Kane.

562
01:12:38,691 --> 01:12:40,625
See?
So?

563
01:12:40,693 --> 01:12:44,629
So, look. He's in
the Alliance Securite
brochure. Same guy.

564
01:12:44,697 --> 01:12:46,858
This guy knows.

565
01:13:18,301 --> 01:13:20,292
My French sucks. I can't...

566
01:13:20,371 --> 01:13:24,831
<i>It says something
about a boat or...</i>

567
01:13:24,908 --> 01:13:28,036
I don't understand.
What does it say? You read it.

568
01:13:28,113 --> 01:13:30,980
Huh? Tell me. Wha...

569
01:13:31,049 --> 01:13:33,449
It says that three weeks
before he was killed...

570
01:13:33,518 --> 01:13:37,420
Mr. Wombosi told police that
a man came on to his yacht...

571
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:40,823
five miles off the coast of Marseille
and tried to kill him.

572
01:13:40,893 --> 01:13:45,262
It says that he chased
the man off the boat
and shot him twice in the back.

573
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:49,125
It says I'm an assassin.

574
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:30,880
<i>Stop the car.</i>

575
01:14:31,492 --> 01:14:33,792
<i>But no...you said Rue de l...
we're almost there.</i>

576
01:14:33,861 --> 01:14:35,591
<i>Just right here, this is good.</i>

577
01:14:35,663 --> 01:14:36,823
<i>l said stop.</i>

578
01:14:37,665 --> 01:14:38,963
What's going on?

579
01:14:40,034 --> 01:14:41,179
Well...what's going on?

580
01:14:41,202 --> 01:14:42,771
<i>What are you doing?</i>

581
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:44,590
<i>Go. Go.</i>

582
01:14:44,615 --> 01:14:45,465
<i>You gave me too much.</i>

583
01:14:45,466 --> 01:14:48,594
We're blown.
Come on.
Blown? What is "blown"?

584
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:51,310
Monsieur...your change, your change.

585
01:14:51,344 --> 01:14:54,444
Sir, please...You can't stay here...
You have to leave.

586
01:14:55,477 --> 01:14:58,105
Ow.
Keep walking.
Keep walking.

587
01:14:58,179 --> 01:15:01,148
What do you think
they're doing there?
They're onto the hotel.

588
01:15:01,217 --> 01:15:04,277
No, you don't know that.
Trust me.
Just keep walking.

589
01:15:25,344 --> 01:15:27,812
Are you crazy?
What are you doing now?

590
01:15:29,782 --> 01:15:31,716
Jason!

591
01:15:31,784 --> 01:15:33,775
This. This is "blown."

592
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:43,096
Marie.
Get away.

593
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:45,394
Marie, stop.
Get away from me.

594
01:15:45,466 --> 01:15:47,491
Stop.
What are you gonna do,
kill me?

595
01:15:47,568 --> 01:15:49,798
Is that what's next?
Listen... Stay calm.
Stay calm.

596
01:15:49,871 --> 01:15:54,501
Whatever we do,
we have to do it together.
We?

597
01:15:54,576 --> 01:15:58,239
The only thing we had
in common was that neither
of us knew who you were.

598
01:15:58,314 --> 01:16:00,248
We're past that now.
Marie, listen to me!

599
01:16:00,316 --> 01:16:03,615
The police will find us,
and the people who took
that picture in the embassy...

600
01:16:03,686 --> 01:16:06,177
the people who killed Wombosi...
they are gonna kill us.

601
01:16:06,256 --> 01:16:08,315
The people who you work for.

602
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:11,960
I will take you
wherever you need to go.

603
01:16:12,029 --> 01:16:14,020
I will take you there.
I will leave you there.

604
01:16:14,097 --> 01:16:16,292
You can do whatever you want.
You never have to see me again.

605
01:16:16,367 --> 01:16:21,304
But not here.
If we stay here, we die.

606
01:16:26,779 --> 01:16:31,307
<i>Great police work.
Really brilliant.</i>

607
01:16:31,384 --> 01:16:35,946
Why don't they just
hang out a banner that says
"Don't come back"?

608
01:16:36,022 --> 01:16:40,550
Jesus Christ.
What is the French word
for stakeout, huh?

609
01:16:44,432 --> 01:16:47,196
Hmm.

610
01:16:47,268 --> 01:16:50,328
Okay. This was 16 minutes ago.

611
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:52,339
This is our starting point.

612
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:55,843
<i>They can't fly.
Trains are risky. Nicky?
Yes.</i>

613
01:16:55,911 --> 01:17:01,076
<i>I need to know everything
Paris's finest is doing on this.
I'm on it.</i>

614
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:05,086
<i>You said 24 hours,
and he's not back.</i>

615
01:17:06,657 --> 01:17:09,854
<i>No. We've got a good idea
where he is.</i>

616
01:17:09,927 --> 01:17:13,158
<i>You've got a black ops agent
who's off the reservation.</i>

617
01:17:13,231 --> 01:17:17,065
<i>He's trashed an American consulate.
He's on the run in Europe.
You don't know why.</i>

618
01:17:17,135 --> 01:17:20,662
I've gotta stand before an
oversight committee. What am I
gonna tell 'em about Treadstone?

619
01:17:20,739 --> 01:17:23,264
You're worried about
a budget meeting?

620
01:17:23,342 --> 01:17:27,244
We don't take care of this,
we don't make it to the men's room.

621
01:17:27,313 --> 01:17:29,247
Is that clear enough for you?

622
01:17:29,315 --> 01:17:32,716
<i>We will burn for this.</i>

623
01:17:32,786 --> 01:17:34,777
We will both of us burn.

624
01:17:36,356 --> 01:17:39,951
I want two teams.
Daryl, Ray, stay on the grids.

625
01:17:40,028 --> 01:17:42,292
<i>Brian, Harris, Steve...</i>

626
01:17:42,363 --> 01:17:46,197
I want to work on this girl.
Where do we stand with
this residency pattern?

627
01:17:46,268 --> 01:17:48,793
- Uh, we started it.
- Get it out.

628
01:17:53,042 --> 01:17:56,478
<i>We cross-referenced
numbers from the grandmother
and the stepbrother.</i>

629
01:17:56,546 --> 01:18:00,482
<i>Whenever we found convergence,
we back-checked those numbers
and ran a search merge...</i>

630
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:03,542
with any other data we had on her,
which wasn't much, but...

631
01:18:03,621 --> 01:18:07,887
These pins. These are
all the places we think she's
lived in the last six years.

632
01:18:07,959 --> 01:18:12,623
One, two, three, four, five.
That's our pool.

633
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:22,163
No answer.
How many times did you
let it ring?

634
01:18:22,241 --> 01:18:24,607
Look, if you don't
wanna go, I'll hitch.

635
01:18:24,677 --> 01:18:27,441
I said I'd take you.

636
01:18:27,513 --> 01:18:29,947
<i>Those are the targets.</i>

637
01:18:30,017 --> 01:18:33,316
Beg, borrow, hack, tap, bypass...

638
01:18:33,387 --> 01:18:35,981
I don't care what you do.

639
01:18:36,056 --> 01:18:40,254
I want to know everything
you can tell me about what's
going on at those locations.

640
01:18:58,115 --> 01:19:00,447
How do you know
he still owns this?

641
01:19:01,953 --> 01:19:05,480
<i>Eamon always had money.
He would never sell this.</i>

642
01:19:23,143 --> 01:19:25,134
<i>Scheiße.</i>

643
01:19:35,023 --> 01:19:37,617
<i>Marie.
What?</i>

644
01:19:39,361 --> 01:19:41,420
We gotta go.

645
01:19:41,496 --> 01:19:44,624
What?
We gotta go.

646
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:47,191
<i>Oh, Scheiße.</i>

647
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:50,137
I thought...

648
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:56,104
<i>Oh, shit. That's Eamon.</i>

649
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:58,114
I'll talk to him.
We're leaving.

650
01:20:01,553 --> 01:20:03,680
Eamon. Hey.

651
01:20:03,755 --> 01:20:05,689
Surprise. It's me... Marie.

652
01:20:05,757 --> 01:20:07,691
Wow, uh, God...

653
01:20:07,759 --> 01:20:10,853
There's a really good
reason for this.

654
01:20:10,930 --> 01:20:12,864
There bloody well better be.

655
01:20:12,932 --> 01:20:15,298
Daddy!
Hang on. Just hang on.

656
01:20:16,636 --> 01:20:18,934
I had no idea
you would be here.

657
01:20:19,005 --> 01:20:23,840
Well, why would I be here?
It's only my bloody house, right?

658
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:27,744
Yeah.
Did she get you into this?

659
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:31,711
It was just
gonna be for a day.

660
01:20:31,786 --> 01:20:34,812
Daddy, Alan
has to go to pee.

661
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:38,018
All right. Come on.
Get out of the car.

662
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:43,963
Come on, Alan.

663
01:20:44,033 --> 01:20:46,297
<i>I'm sorry. I thought it was...
would be okay.</i>

664
01:20:46,369 --> 01:20:48,303
But I guess I was wrong.

665
01:20:48,371 --> 01:20:51,807
Let's find Mummy.
Mummy is away
for two days, thank God.

666
01:20:57,548 --> 01:21:00,949
You've got yourself
all tied up. Okay.

667
01:21:03,688 --> 01:21:07,055
<i>What's he do for a living?</i>

668
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:11,461
He used to be in shipping.
Uh-huh.

669
01:21:12,465 --> 01:21:16,265
Is he good for you?
Are you happy?

670
01:21:16,336 --> 01:21:18,463
You know me.
I try too hard.

671
01:21:40,842 --> 01:21:43,970
Here you go.

672
01:21:44,046 --> 01:21:46,844
<i>Sleep well.
Good night.</i>

673
01:21:48,484 --> 01:21:50,475
I'll sleep on the floor.

674
01:21:56,693 --> 01:21:59,184
This was when?
11:45 a.m.

675
01:21:59,263 --> 01:22:02,892
Which is definitely within
the driving range of Paris.

676
01:22:02,967 --> 01:22:07,131
<i>- The call came from a highway
rest stop, southbound side.
- What's this yellow pin?</i>

677
01:22:07,206 --> 01:22:09,572
She spent a couple of months
there in 1997.

678
01:22:09,641 --> 01:22:11,666
Closest town is Riome.

679
01:22:13,412 --> 01:22:16,848
We took her family's
phone records and collated
the international calls.

680
01:22:16,916 --> 01:22:19,043
<i>They were in Paris
at 2:00 a.m.</i>

681
01:22:19,118 --> 01:22:21,985
<i>They can't fly.
Train's too dangerous.</i>

682
01:22:22,055 --> 01:22:26,549
He knows better than to go
anywhere we might track him.
So this is our best guess.

683
01:23:24,358 --> 01:23:28,055
What are you doing here?
The kids...

684
01:23:28,129 --> 01:23:30,461
<i>I was worried.
You're gonna wake them up.</i>

685
01:23:30,532 --> 01:23:34,059
We gotta...
I don't wanna know
who I am anymore.

686
01:23:34,136 --> 01:23:37,401
Shh.
I don't care.
I don't wanna know.

687
01:23:39,142 --> 01:23:42,737
Come on. We'll...
Everything I found out,
I wanna forget.

688
01:23:42,812 --> 01:23:44,746
It's okay.

689
01:23:44,814 --> 01:23:47,874
I don't care who I am
or what I did.

690
01:23:49,253 --> 01:23:52,416
It's okay.
We have this money.

691
01:23:52,489 --> 01:23:54,480
We can hide.

692
01:23:56,594 --> 01:24:00,030
Could we do that?
Is there any chance
you can do that?

693
01:24:06,872 --> 01:24:10,137
I don't know.

694
01:24:14,081 --> 01:24:16,072
Come on.

695
01:24:23,124 --> 01:24:25,058
<i>Guy. Guy.</i>

696
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:27,458
<i>Here, boy.</i>

697
01:24:27,528 --> 01:24:30,156
<i>Here, boy. Here, boy.
Morning.</i>

698
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:34,396
<i>Christ, you're up early.
Bless you for making coffee.</i>

699
01:24:42,545 --> 01:24:44,877
One night.
You weren't kidding.

700
01:24:44,948 --> 01:24:46,848
<i>For a change.</i>

701
01:24:46,917 --> 01:24:50,580
<i>He's not there either.</i>

702
01:24:50,654 --> 01:24:52,918
<i>You looked by the car?
He's not anywhere.</i>

703
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:56,016
All right.
Let me get dressed.

704
01:24:56,094 --> 01:24:58,824
<i>Who?
Bloody dog's gone missing.</i>

705
01:24:58,897 --> 01:25:00,831
Does that happen a lot?

706
01:25:00,899 --> 01:25:03,265
That mutt miss his breakfast?
Not a chance.

707
01:25:03,336 --> 01:25:05,668
It's always something, right?

708
01:25:06,939 --> 01:25:08,873
Get in the basement.

709
01:25:08,941 --> 01:25:11,603
What?

710
01:25:11,678 --> 01:25:15,045
- Get everyone in the basement.
- What the hell are you talking about?

711
01:25:15,115 --> 01:25:18,209
We're in danger.
Your family's in danger.
I don't have time to explain.

712
01:25:18,285 --> 01:25:21,118
- What the...
- Eamon, you should go.

713
01:25:21,189 --> 01:25:24,090
<i>What the hell have you done?
It's not her. It's me.</i>

714
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:28,220
You need to get out of sight
and in the basement
as quick as you can.

715
01:25:28,297 --> 01:25:30,891
Daddy.

716
01:25:33,669 --> 01:25:35,569
I'm sorry.

717
01:25:35,639 --> 01:25:37,630
Let's go.

718
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,960
The phone is dead.

719
01:25:57,029 --> 01:25:59,122
Yeah.

720
01:25:59,198 --> 01:26:01,257
Jason, who's out there?

721
01:26:01,334 --> 01:26:03,427
<i>Who is it?</i>

722
01:26:09,643 --> 01:26:11,941
Scheiße. Scheiße.

723
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:21,488
<i>What are you doing?</i>

724
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:30,024
We should never have
come here. I... These children...

725
01:26:30,099 --> 01:26:32,465
That's not gonna happen.

726
01:28:58,165 --> 01:29:01,066
Where is it?

727
01:29:01,135 --> 01:29:04,104
Where's the weapon?

728
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:07,474
Who else is out here?

729
01:29:07,542 --> 01:29:10,443
How many you got with you?
I'm not gonna ask you again.

730
01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:13,970
I work alone, like you.

731
01:29:15,718 --> 01:29:17,652
We always work alone.

732
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:20,382
<i>What do you mean?
Who are you? Bonn?</i>

733
01:29:20,457 --> 01:29:22,925
Paris?

734
01:29:24,428 --> 01:29:26,453
Treadstone... both of us.

735
01:29:26,530 --> 01:29:28,464
<i>Treadstone?
Which one?</i>

736
01:29:28,532 --> 01:29:31,365
<i>Paris. I live in Paris.
Do you still get the headaches?</i>

737
01:29:31,436 --> 01:29:33,370
Yeah.

738
01:29:33,438 --> 01:29:36,236
I get such bad headaches.

739
01:29:36,307 --> 01:29:38,571
You know at night
when you're driving a car?

740
01:29:38,644 --> 01:29:41,374
<i>Maybe it's something to do
with the headlights.
What is Treadstone?</i>

741
01:29:42,448 --> 01:29:46,145
Treadstone...
said, "Pioze..."

742
01:29:47,153 --> 01:29:49,553
They said, "Go to Paris."

743
01:29:49,622 --> 01:29:52,090
<i>Is Treadstone in Paris?</i>

744
01:29:53,626 --> 01:29:55,617
Look at this.

745
01:29:56,931 --> 01:29:58,922
Look at what
they make you give.

746
01:30:23,594 --> 01:30:26,324
All right. All right.
All right. All right.

747
01:30:26,396 --> 01:30:29,160
Right, get in the front,
put your belt on.

748
01:30:29,234 --> 01:30:31,464
We're just gonna
put you in the back.

749
01:30:31,536 --> 01:30:33,527
<i>Get in the front, Polly.</i>

750
01:30:39,044 --> 01:30:42,036
I'm not waiting, Marie.
One minute, Eamon.

751
01:30:42,114 --> 01:30:44,105
I'm not waiting!
Please!

752
01:30:44,184 --> 01:30:46,482
<i>Take it.</i>

753
01:30:46,553 --> 01:30:49,989
I took out 30 grand.
The rest is yours.

754
01:30:50,056 --> 01:30:53,287
- That's it?
- That's all I got.

755
01:30:53,361 --> 01:30:56,296
No, that's not what I meant.

756
01:30:56,364 --> 01:30:58,958
This is not gonna stop, Marie.

757
01:30:59,033 --> 01:31:01,729
You gotta get out now,
away from me.

758
01:31:03,038 --> 01:31:05,165
You gotta get out.
You gotta start running.

759
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,174
You get low. You stay low.

760
01:31:07,242 --> 01:31:10,973
No more friends. Nothing familiar.

761
01:31:11,047 --> 01:31:14,346
<i>There's enough in there
for you to make a life.</i>

762
01:31:14,417 --> 01:31:16,942
<i>Any life.
I'm out of here, Marie.</i>

763
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:19,011
Hey.

764
01:31:20,658 --> 01:31:22,649
Get in the car.
You gotta go.

765
01:31:28,066 --> 01:31:30,796
What are you gonna do?

766
01:31:31,870 --> 01:31:34,805
I'll end it. Go ahead.

767
01:31:36,742 --> 01:31:38,733
Please.

768
01:32:56,264 --> 01:32:58,926
Code in, please.

769
01:32:59,001 --> 01:33:01,128
<i>Code in.</i>

770
01:33:04,607 --> 01:33:07,075
<i>Code in.</i>

771
01:33:09,479 --> 01:33:11,413
Who is this?

772
01:33:17,355 --> 01:33:20,051
Who the hell are you?

773
01:33:22,795 --> 01:33:24,729
<i>The man you sent is dead.</i>

774
01:33:24,797 --> 01:33:27,425
<i>So whoever this is,
you better start talking.</i>

775
01:33:28,968 --> 01:33:31,061
Hello, Jason.

776
01:33:31,137 --> 01:33:33,367
So what are we into now?

777
01:33:37,143 --> 01:33:40,044
Come on. It only
goes two ways, Jason.

778
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:44,278
Come in and let us make this right,
or we're gonna keep going
until we're satisfied.

779
01:33:44,352 --> 01:33:46,183
You mean until you kill me.

780
01:33:47,889 --> 01:33:50,517
I can't fix this if I don't know
what the problem is.

781
01:33:50,592 --> 01:33:54,084
<i>So tell me what we're into,
and I'll do the best I can.</i>

782
01:34:01,704 --> 01:34:05,731
Why don't you talk
to Marie, Jason?

783
01:34:05,809 --> 01:34:09,643
<i>Let's ask Marie
what she wants to do.
I don't think she gives a shit.</i>

784
01:34:09,713 --> 01:34:11,772
She's dead.

785
01:34:20,392 --> 01:34:23,054
I'm sorry to hear that.
How did that happen?

786
01:34:23,129 --> 01:34:25,825
<i>She was slowing me down.</i>

787
01:34:25,898 --> 01:34:28,662
Jason, listen.
All we've been doing right from...

788
01:34:28,734 --> 01:34:31,168
Enough. Enough.

789
01:34:31,238 --> 01:34:35,572
<i>5:30 p.m. Paris.
Today. Pont Neuf.</i>

790
01:34:35,642 --> 01:34:38,167
You come alone.
You walk to the middle
of that bridge.

791
01:34:38,246 --> 01:34:40,237
<i>You take off your jacket.
Face east.</i>

792
01:34:40,314 --> 01:34:42,475
<i>I'll redial this number.
Jason, wait.</i>

793
01:34:52,694 --> 01:34:57,654
First flight out.
Tell Nicky I'll call from the car.
Tell her to find Picot now. Go.

794
01:35:00,270 --> 01:35:02,864
So... what are we gonna do?

795
01:35:02,940 --> 01:35:05,909
I told you I'd clean this up.
That's what I'm doing.

796
01:35:05,976 --> 01:35:08,069
Can you really bring him in?

797
01:35:08,145 --> 01:35:11,444
I think we're past that, don't you?

798
01:35:11,516 --> 01:35:15,418
Do you have a better idea?
You've given me nothing but
a trail of collateral damage.

799
01:35:15,487 --> 01:35:17,887
I don't think
I could do much worse.

800
01:35:17,956 --> 01:35:20,982
Why don't you go upstairs
and book a conference room?

801
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:23,494
Maybe you can
talk him to death.

802
01:36:40,549 --> 01:36:43,211
The bus. The tour bus.

803
01:36:43,286 --> 01:36:46,016
<i>Negative.</i>

804
01:36:47,823 --> 01:36:51,281
Position one.
Negative.

805
01:36:51,361 --> 01:36:53,386
Position two.
Negative.

806
01:37:09,114 --> 01:37:12,208
Position three... motorcycle.

807
01:37:12,284 --> 01:37:15,412
Negative.

808
01:37:34,977 --> 01:37:36,740
<i>En position.</i>

809
01:37:39,248 --> 01:37:42,115
- Jason?
- I told you to come alone.

810
01:37:42,185 --> 01:37:44,244
I guess that was
too complicated.

811
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,686
So try this... I'm gone.

812
01:37:58,637 --> 01:38:00,571
<i>Get Nicky on the phone.</i>

813
01:38:15,289 --> 01:38:17,223
<i>Yeah.</i>

814
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:20,624
How long
does it take to wipe the room
down and get it moved?

815
01:38:20,694 --> 01:38:22,628
<i>- Get rid of everything?
- Yeah.</i>

816
01:38:22,697 --> 01:38:25,325
<i>Two to three hours.
All right. Get started.</i>

817
01:38:32,541 --> 01:38:36,307
Listen, no breaks.
Two men outside, one in the lobby
and keep your eyes open.

818
01:38:39,716 --> 01:38:43,174
<i>Keep the truck?
- Keep the truck. I'm gonna
close this unit down.</i>

819
01:38:43,253 --> 01:38:45,244
We'll move the gear
in the truck.

820
01:39:02,441 --> 01:39:06,537
They were covering Spain,
Malta, Morocco. Yes, all
local police radio traffic.

821
01:39:06,612 --> 01:39:10,673
<i>No. For northern Europe
we need an authorized directive.</i>

822
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:15,813
Yeah. Okay. They're on it.
We'll have a satellite download
in 30 minutes.

823
01:40:23,698 --> 01:40:26,132
<i>Where's your field box?</i>

824
01:40:30,506 --> 01:40:33,703
- Where's your field box?
- It's right there.

825
01:40:33,776 --> 01:40:37,576
<i>The system's gone haywire.</i>

826
01:40:37,648 --> 01:40:39,912
That's this window right here.

827
01:40:39,983 --> 01:40:42,247
<i>Dining room window?</i>

828
01:40:42,319 --> 01:40:44,753
<i>I don't get...</i>

829
01:40:47,158 --> 01:40:50,252
Dead.
The phones are dead.

830
01:40:50,328 --> 01:40:54,321
<i>It's Bourne, isn't it?</i>

831
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,391
Just quiet.

832
01:41:43,054 --> 01:41:45,352
You move, you die.

833
01:41:45,423 --> 01:41:47,618
- Bourne.
- Gun down.

834
01:41:53,132 --> 01:41:56,033
In there.

835
01:41:57,370 --> 01:42:00,339
Okay, so what do you want?
Treadstone.

836
01:42:00,407 --> 01:42:02,398
You better take a look around.

837
01:42:02,476 --> 01:42:04,535
There's not much left.
Are you Treadstone?

838
01:42:04,611 --> 01:42:07,739
Am I Treadstone? Me?
What the hell
are you talking about?

839
01:42:07,815 --> 01:42:09,749
<i>He's lost it.</i>

840
01:42:09,817 --> 01:42:13,514
You better start filling in
the blanks, 'cause I thought
we were on the same side.

841
01:42:13,588 --> 01:42:17,251
<i>Whose side is that?
You don't know what you're
doing, do you, Jason?</i>

842
01:42:17,326 --> 01:42:21,387
- You don't have a goddamn clue.
- Who am I?

843
01:42:21,463 --> 01:42:23,397
You're U.S. Government property.

844
01:42:23,465 --> 01:42:26,696
You're a malfunctioning,
$30 million weapon.

845
01:42:26,770 --> 01:42:28,761
You're a total
goddamn catastrophe.

846
01:42:28,838 --> 01:42:32,899
By God, you're gonna
tell me how this happened.
Why are you trying to kill me?

847
01:42:32,977 --> 01:42:35,741
- What happened in Marseille?
- Why are you try...

848
01:42:35,813 --> 01:42:39,044
You sent me to kill Wombosi.
Kill Wombosi?

849
01:42:39,116 --> 01:42:44,076
We can do that anytime we want.
I can send Nicky to do that,
for Christ's sake.

850
01:42:44,156 --> 01:42:46,886
<i>Mr. Wombosi was supposed to
be dead three weeks ago.</i>

851
01:42:46,959 --> 01:42:50,622
He was supposed to have
died in a way where the only
possible explanation was...

852
01:42:50,697 --> 01:42:53,791
that he'd been murdered
by a member of his own
entourage.

853
01:42:53,866 --> 01:42:57,427
I don't send you to kill.
I send you to be invisible.

854
01:42:57,504 --> 01:42:59,563
I send you
because you don't exist.

855
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:02,074
I want to know what
happened in Marseille.

856
01:43:02,142 --> 01:43:04,940
I don't remember
what happened in Marseille.

857
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:09,608
Bullshit! This is
unacceptable, Soldier.
You hear me? You failed.

858
01:43:09,684 --> 01:43:12,619
Unacceptable?
You failed! You failed,
and you're gonna tell me why.

859
01:43:12,687 --> 01:43:15,952
I can't tell you. I don't re...
You brought
John Michael Kane to life.

860
01:43:16,025 --> 01:43:19,552
You put together
a meeting with Wombosi.
You found the security company.

861
01:43:19,629 --> 01:43:24,293
<i>You broke into the office.
You're the one who picked
the yacht as the strike point.</i>

862
01:43:32,810 --> 01:43:35,802
<i>You picked the boat.
You picked the day.</i>

863
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:38,440
<i>You tracked the crew,
the food, the fuel.</i>

864
01:43:38,516 --> 01:43:40,950
<i>You told us where.
You told us when.</i>

865
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:44,786
<i>You hid out
on that boat five days.</i>

866
01:43:44,857 --> 01:43:49,294
<i>You were in, Jason.
You were in. It was over.</i>

867
01:44:48,929 --> 01:44:52,057
<i>No, you do remember.</i>

868
01:44:54,602 --> 01:44:56,593
Don't you?

869
01:45:02,243 --> 01:45:04,234
I don't wanna do this anymore.

870
01:45:04,313 --> 01:45:07,771
I don't think that's
a decision you can make.

871
01:45:12,188 --> 01:45:15,680
Jason Bourne is dead.
Do you hear me?

872
01:45:15,759 --> 01:45:17,727
He drowned two weeks ago.

873
01:45:17,794 --> 01:45:20,126
You're gonna go tell 'em
that Jason Bourne is dead.

874
01:45:20,197 --> 01:45:22,256
Do you understand?
Where are you gonna go?

875
01:45:22,333 --> 01:45:25,530
I swear to God, if I even
feel somebody behind me...

876
01:45:25,603 --> 01:45:30,302
there is no measure to how fast
and how hard I will bring this
fight to your doorstep.

877
01:45:30,375 --> 01:45:32,605
I'm on my own side now.

878
01:49:07,218 --> 01:49:09,152
It's done.

879
01:49:09,220 --> 01:49:12,314
<i>Shut it down.</i>

880
01:49:48,831 --> 01:49:51,823
<i>The Treadstone Project
has already been terminated.</i>

881
01:49:51,901 --> 01:49:55,064
It was designed primarily as
a sort of advanced game program.

882
01:49:55,138 --> 01:49:57,698
We'd hoped it might build
into a good training platform...

883
01:49:57,774 --> 01:50:01,073
but, quite honestly,
for a strictly theoretical exercise...

884
01:50:01,144 --> 01:50:04,170
the cost-benefit ratio
was just too high.

885
01:50:04,248 --> 01:50:06,239
It's all but decommissioned
at this point.

886
01:50:06,317 --> 01:50:08,615
All right.
What's next?
Okay.

887
01:50:08,686 --> 01:50:12,782
This is... Black Briar.

888
01:50:12,858 --> 01:50:15,827
<i>Black Briar is a joint D.O.D.
Communications program...</i>

889
01:50:15,894 --> 01:50:17,919
<i>that we really feel
has good traction.</i>

890
01:50:17,996 --> 01:50:20,487
<i>It's got legs.
It'll run and run.</i>

891
01:50:20,567 --> 01:50:24,162
<i>It combines elements of...</i>

892
01:51:08,319 --> 01:51:11,152
<i>This your store?
Yeah.</i>

893
01:51:12,158 --> 01:51:14,752
It's nice.

894
01:51:14,827 --> 01:51:16,954
It's a little hard to find, but...

895
01:51:20,700 --> 01:51:23,601
Think I could rent a scooter?

896
01:51:26,274 --> 01:51:28,208
You have I. D?

897
01:51:29,877 --> 01:51:31,868
Not really.
