What?

4
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:05,516
I said...

5
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:09,104
I want to tell you my story.

6
00:01:09,794 --> 00:01:11,139
What the hell?

7
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:13,809
Why are you talking like that?

8
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:18,087
Who the fuck are you?

9
00:01:26,614 --> 00:01:27,663
My...

10
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:30,874
name is...

11
00:01:33,632 --> 00:01:34,681
Oh...

12
00:01:36,732 --> 00:01:37,771
...Dae-su.

13
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,827
Stop flirting with his girlfriend.

14
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:42,710
Hold on.

15
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:46,869
- Mr. Oh Dae-su!
- Was I flirting with her? Was I?

16
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:50,997
OK! OK!

17
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:57,155
Sit down, Oh Dae-su.
You've had too much to drink.

18
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:05,529
I need to piss first.

19
00:02:05,928 --> 00:02:09,344
I wasn't even flirting!
Motherfucker!

20
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:11,924
Asshole!

21
00:02:11,926 --> 00:02:13,634
Sit down!

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,749
I'm so sorry.

23
00:02:17,363 --> 00:02:20,320
Fuck, I really need to piss.

24
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:23,399
- Isn't she cute?
- Very. Now sit down.

25
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:26,359
It's my daughter's birthday today.

26
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:29,486
I got her a birthday present.

27
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,938
A little cloud
floating in the sky

28
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:37,665
A pleasure boat
sailing on the river

29
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:40,244
My name, Oh Dae-su, means...

30
00:02:42,323 --> 00:02:45,860
..."getting through
one day at a time."

31
00:02:45,862 --> 00:02:48,069
That's what "Oh Dae-su" means.

32
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:50,655
But...God...

33
00:02:51,654 --> 00:02:55,028
why can't I get through today?

34
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,449
Let me go!

35
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:02,283
- Shut the fuck up!
- Let me go!

36
00:03:20,715 --> 00:03:22,383
Let go!
Get away from me!

37
00:03:23,032 --> 00:03:25,150
Grab him!

38
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,138
He should be locked up.

39
00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:38,445
I'll make sure he doesn't get
drunk and cause trouble again.

40
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:40,235
Have a nice day, Officer.

41
00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:43,150
He's usually a nice guy.

42
00:03:43,152 --> 00:03:44,399
Let's go.

43
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:46,857
I'll come back and see you soon.

44
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,484
Do us a favour and
don't come back again.

45
00:03:49,486 --> 00:03:53,572
- That's up to me, assholes.
- Hey!

46
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,157
Yeun-hee, it's Daddy...

47
00:03:58,317 --> 00:04:00,195
Yeun-hee, it's Daddy...

48
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:03,095
Daddy's got a present
for my little Yeun-hee.

49
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:06,987
I'll be home soon with your present,
just wait a bit longer...

50
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:08,070
Let me talk to her.

51
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:10,860
- Good girl.
- Give me the phone.

52
00:04:11,444 --> 00:04:13,992
Yeun-hee,
Joo-hwan wants a word with you.

53
00:04:13,994 --> 00:04:17,080
You remember Joo-hwan, don't you?
Hold on.

54
00:04:18,987 --> 00:04:20,405
Hello, Yeun-hee.

55
00:04:20,575 --> 00:04:23,232
It's me, Joo-hwan.

56
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:27,278
So it's your birthday today?

57
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:29,316
Happy birthday!

58
00:04:29,526 --> 00:04:32,233
I'll buy you a nice treat tomorrow.

59
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:35,188
Hello? Oh, hello, Ja-hyun.

60
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:39,011
I'm sorry. I know it's very late.

61
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:42,970
Dae-su is on his way home.
I'm sorry. Yes?

62
00:04:43,162 --> 00:04:45,490
Hold on.
Dae-su, it's your wife.

63
00:04:47,608 --> 00:04:48,697
Dae-su!

64
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:52,613
Dae-su!

65
00:05:09,906 --> 00:05:12,653
Your wife says you should hurry home!

66
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:16,219
Dae-su, let's get going!
Stop messing around!

67
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:20,985
Sir, sir!

68
00:06:20,987 --> 00:06:23,774
Wait, come here!
Come and talk to me!

69
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:27,986
I won't ask you to let me go again!

70
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:32,361
Just tell me why I'm here, please!

71
00:06:32,363 --> 00:06:34,611
I have a right to know why!

72
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:38,015
God, I've already been locked
in here for two months!

73
00:06:38,017 --> 00:06:39,936
Sir, wait, come here!

74
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:45,019
Sir, wait. What is this place?

75
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:49,548
Please sir, just tell me how
long I have to stay here!

76
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,389
Sir!

77
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:53,152
Fuck you!

78
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,919
Come here, you asshole!

79
00:06:58,294 --> 00:06:59,963
Son of a bitch!

80
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:04,297
I saw your face, asshole!
You're dead if I get out!

81
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,980
I'm sorry!
I won't swear at you again!

82
00:07:06,982 --> 00:07:11,007
Just tell me how much longer.
One month? Two? Three?

83
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:15,278
Don't go! I'm sorry!

84
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,037
Just tell me how long,
you son of a bitch!

85
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:22,870
I said tell me how long,
you asshole!

86
00:07:22,872 --> 00:07:26,168
Son of a bitch!

87
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:29,494
You fucking assholes!

88
00:07:31,824 --> 00:07:35,530
<i>If they had told me then
that it would be 15 years...</i>

89
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:38,987
<i>...would it have been
easier to endure?</i>

90
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,537
<i>Or harder?</i>

91
00:07:43,487 --> 00:07:45,600
"LAUGH, AND THE WORLD
LAUGHS WITH YOU."

92
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:47,713
 "WEEP, AND YOU WEEP ALONE."

93
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:57,004
<i>When the music begins,
gas is released.</i>

94
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,832
<i>When the gas is released,
I fall asleep.</i>

95
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,909
<i>Later on, I found out...</i>

96
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:23,892
<i>that it was the same valium gas that
Russian soldiers used on Chechen terrorists.</i>

97
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:33,992
<i>When I wake up,
my hair has been cut.</i>

98
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:36,779
<i>I don't really like the style.</i>

99
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:43,832
<i>But they change my clothes
and clean the room.</i>

100
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:46,169
<i>Generous bastards.</i>

101
00:08:49,316 --> 00:08:50,485
One!

102
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:52,863
Two!

103
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,859
Three!

104
00:08:58,027 --> 00:09:00,735
It's too spicy.

105
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:03,942
I don't want spinach. You eat it.
I won't eat spinach.

106
00:09:07,968 --> 00:09:11,634
Mrs. Kim Ja-hyun's body was found
with stab wounds to the neck.

107
00:09:11,804 --> 00:09:14,431
This was a cold-blooded murder.

108
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:17,388
As nothing of value was taken,

109
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,057
police suspect a personal motive.

110
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:24,699
The victim's husband, Oh Dae-su,
disappeared a year ago and is still at large.

111
00:09:24,701 --> 00:09:28,187
Witnesses say Oh Dae-su
was a heavy drinker,

112
00:09:28,189 --> 00:09:30,617
who fought constantly with his wife.

113
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:33,536
Neighbours also frequently
argued with Oh Dae-su.

114
00:09:34,685 --> 00:09:39,194
Blood samples found at the scene
match those of Oh Dae-su.

115
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:43,496
Oh Dae-su's fingerprints have been
matched to those found on a cup.

116
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:49,156
Sources claim that Oh Dae-su
definitely visited his wife recently.

117
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:55,450
The only missing item was a family album,
which backs the police theories.

118
00:10:28,107 --> 00:10:33,612
<i>After three years,
many wrinkles form on a man's face.</i>

119
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,775
<i>If you stand outside a
phone box on a rainy day...</i>

120
00:10:51,636 --> 00:10:54,923
<i>...and meet a man whose face
is hidden by a violet umbrella,</i>

121
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,155
<i>my advice is that you
make friends with television.</i>

122
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:03,942
<i>The television is both
clock and calendar.</i>

123
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:08,208
<i>It is your school, home, church,</i>

124
00:11:08,947 --> 00:11:10,025
<i>friend...</i>

125
00:11:11,274 --> 00:11:12,403
<i>...and lover.</i>

126
00:11:13,532 --> 00:11:14,571
<i>But...</i>

127
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:37,708
<i>But...</i>

128
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:40,462
<i>...my lover's song...</i>

129
00:11:42,696 --> 00:11:44,173
<i>...is too short.</i>

130
00:11:52,014 --> 00:11:55,541
Today at 7:50 AM,
the middle of Seoul's Sangsu Bridge,

131
00:11:55,543 --> 00:11:58,660
50 metres in length,
suddenly collapsed...

132
00:11:58,947 --> 00:12:01,095
<i>I wrote a list...</i>

133
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:04,764
<i>of all the people I had offended,
quarrelled with and hurt.</i>

134
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,087
<i>This was both my prison journal</i>

135
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,191
<i>and the autobiography
of my evil deeds.</i>

136
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,566
<i>I thought I had lived
a normal life...</i>

137
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,450
<i>...but there was too
much wrong-doing.</i>

138
00:12:32,193 --> 00:12:35,530
<i>All I could think at that moment...</i>

139
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:41,154
<i>was that the man in the next room
probably only had one chopstick.</i>

140
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:44,441
<i>But...</i>

141
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:47,568
<i>But...</i>

142
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,985
<i>Who had imprisoned me?</i>

143
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:01,074
<i>Was it Yoo Heung-sam?</i>

144
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:03,862
<i>Lee So-young or Kang Chang-suk?</i>

145
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:06,772
<i>Whoever it was, wait.</i>

146
00:13:07,974 --> 00:13:09,682
<i>Just you wait.</i>

147
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:17,318
<i>I'll rip your body limb from limb,
and your remains will never be found.</i>

148
00:13:18,002 --> 00:13:20,879
<i>Because I will swallow every last bit.</i>

149
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:45,801
<i>One line for each year.</i>

150
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:51,154
<i>When I start doing this,
I am already six lines behind.</i>

151
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:54,651
<i>So next year will be easier.</i>

152
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,833
<i>The more tattoos I have,
the shorter the chopstick becomes.</i>

153
00:14:03,152 --> 00:14:05,472
<i>The shorter the chopstick becomes,</i>

154
00:14:05,474 --> 00:14:07,592
<i>the bigger the hole
in the wall becomes.</i>

155
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:10,445
<i>Anyway...</i>

156
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:13,716

177
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,318
<i>Should I steal or rob?</i>

178
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:21,508
<i>What shall I eat first?
Kimchee soup? Barbecued eel?</i>

179
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:23,978
<i>Anything but fried dumplings.</i>

180
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:26,677
<i>But where am I?</i>

181
00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:29,276
<i>With all the car horns,
it must be the city.</i>

182
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,887
<i>The most important thing
is what floor I'm on.</i>

183
00:16:33,532 --> 00:16:36,659
<i>What if I break through the wall
and I'm on the 52nd floor?</i>

184
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:40,713
<i>Even if I plunge to my death,
I'll still be getting out.</i>

185
00:16:41,328 --> 00:16:45,914
<i>I'm getting out.
In one month, I'm getting out.</i>

186
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,079
Picture yourself...

187
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:18,702
lying in a field.

188
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:22,682
When you hear the bell...

189
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:26,114
...you will turn your head...

190
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:29,143
...and look down.

191
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:34,063
You will see...

192
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:37,114
...an endless field of green grass.

193
00:17:39,745 --> 00:17:41,623
The sun is shining brightly...

194
00:17:43,152 --> 00:17:44,861
...there's a cool breeze.

195
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,717
It's a human being.

196
00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:48,697
Don't stop me!

197
00:19:30,615 --> 00:19:31,444
Mister!

198
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,179
Even though...

199
00:19:35,303 --> 00:19:38,720
...I'm no better than a beast...

200
00:19:41,936 --> 00:19:45,352
...don't I have the right to live?

201
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:52,272
Mister.

202
00:19:53,152 --> 00:19:54,611
Even though...

203
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,989
...I'm no better...

204
00:19:58,157 --> 00:19:59,576
...than a beast...

205
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:07,091
...don't I have the right...

206
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,389
...to live?

207
00:20:12,662 --> 00:20:13,711
Yes.

208
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:16,588
Yes.

209
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:39,843
The alley with the
phone box was just here.

210
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:41,639
Now there's a block of flats.

211
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:47,108
So he releases me onto the roof.
What a fool.

212
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:50,877
I want to tell you my story.

213
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,863
Die later.

214
00:20:53,342 --> 00:20:54,551
What?

215
00:21:02,821 --> 00:21:04,449
What the hell?

216
00:21:10,126 --> 00:21:11,335
I see.

217
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:15,952
Now I'll tell you my story.

218
00:21:19,073 --> 00:21:20,202
The reason...

219
00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:23,742
...I want to die is...

220
00:21:27,627 --> 00:21:28,786
Hey!

221
00:21:33,572 --> 00:21:35,280
That's a female human being.

222
00:22:04,431 --> 00:22:05,878
<i>Laugh,</i>

223
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,587
<i>and the world laughs with you.</i>

224
00:22:09,313 --> 00:22:10,392
<i>Weep,</i>

225
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:13,088
<i>and you weep alone.</i>

226
00:22:17,979 --> 00:22:19,597
<i>My home is gone.</i>

227
00:22:20,445 --> 00:22:23,112
<i>I cannot call
my friends or relatives.</i>

228
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:27,030
<i>Because they say
I murdered my wife.</i>

229
00:22:30,206 --> 00:22:31,755
<i>I am a fugitive.</i>

230
00:22:57,381 --> 00:22:59,485
You dickshit!

231
00:23:11,137 --> 00:23:12,306
<i>Dickshit...</i>

232
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,118
<i>A new word.</i>

233
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:19,946
<i>Television doesn't teach
you swear words.</i>

234
00:23:28,048 --> 00:23:33,723
<i>Can 15 years' worth of
imaginary training be put to use?</i>

235
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,398
<i>Apparently, it can.</i>

236
00:23:48,786 --> 00:23:50,244
<i>Rock Bream.</i>

237
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:53,322
<i>Oplegnathus fasciatus.</i>

238
00:23:54,134 --> 00:23:56,762
<i>Lives in the warm waters
of coastal reefs.</i>

239
00:23:57,657 --> 00:23:59,739
<i>This fish has weak reflexes,</i>

240
00:23:59,741 --> 00:24:03,237
<i>but can resist powerfully
when caught in a hook.</i>

241
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:06,779
<i>In the Kyungsang Province,
its offspring...</i>

242
00:24:07,258 --> 00:24:09,296
<i>What is that smell?</i>

243
00:24:21,829 --> 00:24:24,996
Don't bother asking me any questions.

244
00:24:25,816 --> 00:24:27,524
I don't know anything.

245
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,979
Yes?

246
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:53,367
I said... I want to eat...
a living thing.

247
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:59,906
Oh... right.

248
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:01,484
Long time no see.

249
00:25:01,811 --> 00:25:03,899
<i>This is my first time here.</i>

250
00:25:04,607 --> 00:25:05,816
Maybe I'm wrong.

251
00:25:06,031 --> 00:25:07,950
<i>But she looks familiar.</i>

252
00:25:09,522 --> 00:25:13,938
You look very familiar.
Have we met before?

253
00:25:14,632 --> 00:25:17,339
"Search for the Best Chef."

254
00:25:18,027 --> 00:25:20,850
"Thursdays at 6:30 on MBC."

255
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,129
"The youngest female chef
of Japanese cuisine."

256
00:25:23,341 --> 00:25:24,390
Oh, that?

257
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:28,848
They said the ratings are low,
but someone must watch it.

258
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,569
Women's hands are usually warm,
so they cannot make sushi.

259
00:25:32,571 --> 00:25:35,118
Well, you certainly know your stuff.

260
00:25:48,487 --> 00:25:49,656
Who are you?

261
00:25:53,364 --> 00:25:55,131
Do you...

262
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:56,392
like your clothes?

263
00:26:03,032 --> 00:26:04,401
Why?

264
00:26:06,819 --> 00:26:09,776
- Why did you imprison me?
- Who do you think I am?

265
00:26:12,161 --> 00:26:14,039
- Yoo Heung-sam?
- Wrong.

266
00:26:14,752 --> 00:26:17,919
- Did Lee So-young pay you?
- Wrong again.

267
00:26:18,637 --> 00:26:19,676
Lee Jong-yong?

268
00:26:20,735 --> 00:26:21,774
Kang Chang-suk?

269
00:26:22,812 --> 00:26:24,980
Hwang Joo-yeun? Kim Na-sung?

270
00:26:25,596 --> 00:26:29,274
Park Jin-woo? Im Duk-yoon?
Lee Jae-pyung? Kuk Su-ran?

271
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:31,984
- Who the hell are you?
- Me?

272
00:26:32,522 --> 00:26:34,100
I'm a sort of scholar.

273
00:26:35,103 --> 00:26:36,772
And my field of study is you.

274
00:26:37,756 --> 00:26:39,603
A scholar studying Oh Dae-su.

275
00:26:40,235 --> 00:26:42,493
An expert on Oh Dae-su.

276
00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:46,415
Who I am isn't important.
What's important is "why".

277
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:47,916
Think hard.

278
00:26:48,117 --> 00:26:50,075
Study your whole lifetime.

279
00:26:51,168 --> 00:26:54,635
School has finished,
now it's time for your homework.

280
00:26:56,802 --> 00:26:58,060
Keep this in mind:

281
00:26:59,156 --> 00:27:01,654
"Whether it be a grain
of sand or a rock,

282
00:27:02,198 --> 00:27:04,196
in water they both sink alike."

283
00:27:05,594 --> 00:27:06,973
Let me ask you one thing.

284
00:27:08,064 --> 00:27:11,891
You hypnotized me in there,
didn't you?

285
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:14,678
What did you do to me?

286
00:27:15,915 --> 00:27:17,413
I miss you.

287
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:19,435
Come quickly.

288
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:33,028
Here you are.

289
00:27:36,636 --> 00:27:37,755
It's alive, OK?

290
00:27:39,543 --> 00:27:41,751
I'll go and slice it up for you.

291
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:21,584
I must be a different breed of woman.
My hands are very cold.

292
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:24,888
<i>What is she doing?</i>

293
00:28:30,462 --> 00:28:31,301
Sir.

294
00:28:32,748 --> 00:28:34,376
Sir, wake up.

295
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,999
<i>Keep this in mind.</i>

296
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:42,748
<i>"Whether it be a grain
of sand or a rock...</i>

297
00:28:43,794 --> 00:28:47,380
<i>...in water they both sink alike. "</i>

298
00:28:53,936 --> 00:28:55,434
Are you awake?

299
00:29:05,852 --> 00:29:07,310
Is all this true?

300
00:29:28,822 --> 00:29:30,610
That fever remedy works well.

301
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:36,077
Why did you faint if you've done
so much physical training?

302
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:43,714
A lack of vital sunlight leaves one
depleted of vitamins A and E.

303
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:48,761
Thus, one's immunity to
influenza is weakened.

304
00:29:51,138 --> 00:29:53,016
Do you always talk like that?

305
00:30:06,201 --> 00:30:08,632
The lock on the
bathroom door is broken.

306
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:10,641
Don't get any bright ideas

307
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,858
or I'll gut you like a fish.

308
00:30:14,957 --> 00:30:15,996
What's this?

309
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:21,375
Suppositories. You fainted, so
how else could I give you medicine?

310
00:30:36,482 --> 00:30:40,898
<i>Can 15 years' worth of
imaginary training be put to use?</i>

311
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,108
<i>Apparently not.</i>

312
00:31:06,263 --> 00:31:08,181
That was an unforgivable sin.

313
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:16,679
I brought you back here
and then turned you down.

314
00:31:17,483 --> 00:31:19,071
I can see why you're angry.

315
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:21,524
I really can.

316
00:31:25,105 --> 00:31:29,111
You know, I brought you
here because I like you.

317
00:31:30,012 --> 00:31:31,171
But...

318
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:36,069
You don't even know my name yet.

319
00:31:37,077 --> 00:31:38,236
It's Mido.

320
00:31:39,866 --> 00:31:41,074
You see...

321
00:31:42,615 --> 00:31:43,824
...later on...

322
00:31:45,566 --> 00:31:47,274
...when I'm really ready...

323
00:31:48,596 --> 00:31:51,303
...I swear on my life
that I'll go through with it.

324
00:31:52,988 --> 00:31:56,614
That song in your diary, "The Face
I Want to See", that will be the sign.

325
00:31:57,383 --> 00:32:02,258
When I sing it, get ready.

326
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:10,809
I may try to resist you again
in the heat of the moment.

327
00:32:11,843 --> 00:32:14,260
But no matter what, don't stop.

328
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:17,243
Just give it to me!

329
00:32:19,883 --> 00:32:21,051
<i>Give it...</i>

330
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:24,419
<i>...to me.</i>

331
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:31,798
The ants...

332
00:32:32,961 --> 00:32:34,329
Do you still see them?

333
00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:37,117
Do you still feel that way?

334
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:42,203
Yeah, if you're alone, you see ants.

335
00:32:43,412 --> 00:32:48,579
People I have met who are very lonely
have all hallucinated about ants.

336
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:52,227
I tried once to work out why.

337
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,761
Ants move around in groups,
you know.

338
00:32:56,321 --> 00:33:00,327
So I suppose very lonely people
keep thinking of ants.

339
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:04,249
Although I have never done that.

340
00:34:07,071 --> 00:34:12,117
She called from overseas five or six
years ago, asking if her dad had come back.

341
00:34:12,856 --> 00:34:16,772
She doesn't even know
that he killed her mother.

342
00:34:17,254 --> 00:34:20,753
She has hardly any relatives,
so she calls us.

343
00:34:22,142 --> 00:34:24,560
Her Korean has got worse.

344
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:29,366
I think her Swedish foster
parents are both doctors.

345
00:34:32,486 --> 00:34:34,194
You journalists must know...

346
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,917
Dae-su...

347
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:41,416
Is he really still on the run?

348
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,949
Your daughter's address
is on the front

349
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:51,538
and on the back is a map
of your wife's grave.

350
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:56,609
<i>Eva...</i>

351
00:34:57,484 --> 00:34:58,827
<i>Stockholm...</i>

352
00:34:59,616 --> 00:35:00,535
<i>Eva...</i>

353
00:35:02,071 --> 00:35:03,572
Do you want to call her?

354
00:35:10,863 --> 00:35:12,363
Shall I call her?

355
00:35:18,346 --> 00:35:20,445
Shall we visit the grave tomorrow?

356
00:35:26,987 --> 00:35:27,999
<i>No,</i>

357
00:35:28,804 --> 00:35:31,034
<i>first I have to
kill that bastard.</i>

358
00:35:57,744 --> 00:35:59,656
"BLUE DRAGON"

359
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,262
Well?

360
00:36:03,472 --> 00:36:05,214
<i>I haven't tasted it yet.</i>

361
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:08,947
"BLUE DRAGON"

362
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,943
So?

363
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,239
Did it taste the same?

364
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:32,243
<i>I could taste food from
100 restaurants...</i>

365
00:36:34,779 --> 00:36:37,818
<i>...but I will never forget the
food I tasted for 15 years.</i>

366
00:36:44,951 --> 00:36:46,449
"BLUE DRAGON"

367
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,657
Shall I create an ID for you,
so you can log in?

368
00:37:09,406 --> 00:37:11,864
Do you have a favourite
film or song?

369
00:37:13,612 --> 00:37:17,658
I've already been talking...

370
00:37:18,307 --> 00:37:19,886
...to him...

371
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:29,196
"The Count of Monte Cristo"?

372
00:37:31,404 --> 00:37:36,699
There's no one by that name here.

373
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:48,737
"HOW'S LIFE IN A BIGGER PRISON,
OH DAE-SU?"

374
00:37:48,985 --> 00:37:50,115
Who are you?

375
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:56,065
Who are you?

376
00:37:57,405 --> 00:37:59,456
"THE LONELY PRINCE IN THE HIGH TOWER."

377
00:37:59,526 --> 00:38:00,565
Who is he?

378
00:38:06,529 --> 00:38:09,526
I don't know who he is.
I just chat to him sometimes.

379
00:38:10,147 --> 00:38:11,776
We talk about sushi.

380
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,340
Where are you going?

381
00:38:31,402 --> 00:38:32,533
Where are you going?

382
00:38:32,901 --> 00:38:34,401
You are not to be trusted.

383
00:38:51,114 --> 00:38:52,913
- VIOL...
- BLUE DRAGON

384
00:38:52,923 --> 00:38:58,197
Violet Blue Dragon...
What does that mean?

385
00:39:10,865 --> 00:39:13,362
<i>Why did they order
from a place so far away?</i>

386
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:17,488
<i>I've already passed
five Chinese restaurants.</i>

387
00:39:20,193 --> 00:39:22,863
<i>I think my lungs are on
the verge of exploding.</i>

388
00:39:29,736 --> 00:39:34,281
You there, tell your cooks to put
less scallions in the dumplings.

389
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:36,729
OK.

390
00:39:47,988 --> 00:39:49,776
- Leave it there and go.
- Yes, sir.

391
00:40:27,549 --> 00:40:31,364
We don't take on anyone
who uses bodyguards.

392
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:33,652
Some companies specialize in that.

393
00:40:34,571 --> 00:40:36,069
You should go to them.

394
00:40:36,989 --> 00:40:39,776
We just take the small fry.

395
00:40:41,055 --> 00:40:44,781
If the stay is over six months,
transportation is free.

396
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,528
Yes, of course.

397
00:40:54,031 --> 00:40:55,820
Why did you imprison me, you...

398
00:40:58,443 --> 00:41:00,235
...dickshit.

399
00:41:01,944 --> 00:41:07,858
In our business on floor 7½,
client confidentiality is our livelihood.

400
00:41:27,028 --> 00:41:29,736
I am going to avenge
myself for all 15 years.

401
00:41:30,964 --> 00:41:34,151
Each tooth I extract
will age you by one year.

402
00:41:50,164 --> 00:41:51,234
Keep still.

403
00:41:59,326 --> 00:42:00,615
Do you want to talk?

404
00:42:22,443 --> 00:42:24,569
I don't know...

405
00:42:24,571 --> 00:42:27,430
I don't know... I didn't see his face...

406
00:42:27,432 --> 00:42:30,279
I don't know... I didn't see his face... I made recordings...

407
00:42:44,011 --> 00:42:45,510
"OH DAE-SU"

408
00:42:51,574 --> 00:42:54,281
All those who are blood-type AB,
raise your hand.

409
00:43:07,389 --> 00:43:09,906
Go. Shoo!
He has lost a lot of blood.

410
00:44:02,993 --> 00:44:04,151
Piece of shit.

411
00:44:09,387 --> 00:44:10,865
Is he dead?

412
00:46:40,195 --> 00:46:41,864
I can't seem to...

413
00:46:42,493 --> 00:46:44,861
get through today either.

414
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:50,285
Now I have become a monster.

415
00:46:51,864 --> 00:46:53,782
When my vengeance is over...

416
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:56,909
...can I return to Oh Dae-su?

417
00:47:02,693 --> 00:47:05,900
Mister, are you alright?

418
00:47:05,902 --> 00:47:08,737
Look at all this blood.

419
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:12,029
What happened to you?

420
00:47:17,469 --> 00:47:20,695
Saewoon Apartments, Eung-am,
building 8. Take care of him.

421
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,521
Thank you.

422
00:47:24,031 --> 00:47:25,360
Not at all.

423
00:47:26,279 --> 00:47:28,277
Well, then...

424
00:47:29,616 --> 00:47:30,865
Farewell, Oh Dae-su.

425
00:47:34,861 --> 00:47:35,910
<i>Farewell...</i>

426
00:47:37,298 --> 00:47:38,877
<i>...Oh Dae-su.</i>

427
00:47:40,405 --> 00:47:41,444
<i>Farewell.</i>

428
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,611
<i>Farewell.</i>

429
00:48:41,334 --> 00:48:43,502
The bastard you hate,
but don't dare kill.

430
00:48:43,736 --> 00:48:46,741
The bitch you detest, who
deserves a fate worse than death.

431
00:48:46,743 --> 00:48:48,321
We are at your service.

432
00:48:50,035 --> 00:48:53,032
Won't he go crazy if he's
locked up for a long time?

433
00:48:53,034 --> 00:48:58,069
Well, if you don't want that,
we can drug his drinks.

434
00:48:58,475 --> 00:49:01,129
There's a thing called
'Risterdal solution'.

435
00:49:01,131 --> 00:49:04,628
It's a reliable drug used
to treat schizophrenia.

436
00:49:05,934 --> 00:49:09,140
But it depends on the
length of the treatment,

437
00:49:09,482 --> 00:49:11,918
so how long will he...

438
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,969
15 years.

439
00:49:15,338 --> 00:49:16,850
Is that possible?

440
00:49:16,852 --> 00:49:18,770
What did he do?

441
00:49:19,536 --> 00:49:21,114
Oh Dae-su, you see...

442
00:49:22,443 --> 00:49:24,491
...talks too much.

443
00:49:26,953 --> 00:49:27,908
Go to sleep.

444
00:49:29,137 --> 00:49:32,323
Tomorrow, you will visit
Joo-hwan's internet cafe.

445
00:49:42,695 --> 00:49:44,661
Sit wherever you like.

446
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:48,027
Joo-hwan.

447
00:49:59,906 --> 00:50:01,364
Oh Dae-su, you see...

448
00:50:02,273 --> 00:50:03,902
...talks too much.

449
00:50:08,407 --> 00:50:10,485
Have you heard this voice before?

450
00:50:11,555 --> 00:50:13,702
Who loathes me this much?

451
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:23,668
Those 260 women you've had...

452
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:27,859
I don't know the names
of their husbands...

453
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:31,224
"LOGON: MONSTER"

454
00:50:37,072 --> 00:50:38,827
"MIDO."

455
00:50:41,404 --> 00:50:43,173
Who's Mido?

456
00:50:43,175 --> 00:50:45,043
A little girl who cries a lot.

457
00:50:49,486 --> 00:50:50,535
Joo-hwan...

458
00:50:53,492 --> 00:50:54,531
Did I...

459
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,368
...really talk too much?

460
00:51:01,175 --> 00:51:02,243
My friend...

461
00:51:02,296 --> 00:51:04,634
Maybe you should...

462
00:51:06,008 --> 00:51:10,285
...look for the criminal
among people you're close to.

463
00:51:12,777 --> 00:51:15,700
"SEARCH: EVERGREEN"

464
00:51:21,357 --> 00:51:22,493
"CHAT TO EVERGREEN?"

465
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:30,675
"CONGRATULATIONS, YOUR CASE WAS
AUTOMATICALLY DISMISSED YESTERDAY."

466
00:51:30,677 --> 00:51:32,435
But please remember this...

467
00:51:33,612 --> 00:51:34,821
Open quote.

468
00:51:36,739 --> 00:51:39,786
Like a gazelle from the
hand of the hunter...

469
00:51:39,946 --> 00:51:43,032
Like a bird from the
snare of the fowler...

470
00:51:44,262 --> 00:51:45,700
Free yourself.

471
00:51:49,616 --> 00:51:51,034
Close quote.

472
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:54,531
Who are you? You bastard!

473
00:51:55,929 --> 00:51:58,077
I decided when I was a prisoner...

474
00:51:58,453 --> 00:52:00,875
that if I got out,
I would trust no one.

475
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:03,612
If I met anyone suspicious,

476
00:52:03,824 --> 00:52:06,489
I would invent a secret,
only known to the two of us.

477
00:52:08,027 --> 00:52:11,154
That ID, Monster, is a trap
I designed to catch him.

478
00:52:12,241 --> 00:52:14,821
You let a stranger into your home.
Who are you?

479
00:52:25,366 --> 00:52:26,659
Who's Evergreen?

480
00:52:34,682 --> 00:52:38,867
I tracked down that Evergreen ID
and found the owner's details.

481
00:52:38,869 --> 00:52:41,194
- Are you ready to jot it down?
- Go ahead.

482
00:52:41,404 --> 00:52:44,679
It's Su Dae-oh.
Does the surname 'Su' even exist?

483
00:52:44,681 --> 00:52:48,207
- Address?
- Saewoon Apartments in Eung-am.

484
00:52:48,209 --> 00:52:49,708
Building 7, flat 407.

485
00:52:55,181 --> 00:52:57,276
<i>Actually, life in a bigger prison</i>

486
00:52:57,278 --> 00:52:59,576
<i>does not suit me very well.</i>

487
00:53:18,277 --> 00:53:19,576
Evergreen.

488
00:53:21,444 --> 00:53:22,653
Who are you?

489
00:53:27,408 --> 00:53:29,076
Is that what you wanted to ask?

490
00:53:30,695 --> 00:53:33,662
No. You must find that
out for yourself.

491
00:53:33,664 --> 00:53:35,001
Come on, it's a game.

492
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:39,156
First " who?".
Then "why?".

493
00:53:40,235 --> 00:53:42,453
When you know the answer,
come and see me.

494
00:53:42,865 --> 00:53:44,651
I'll mark your work.

495
00:53:44,653 --> 00:53:46,529
You have until July 5th.

496
00:53:48,617 --> 00:53:50,995
Oh no, only five days left.

497
00:53:53,742 --> 00:53:54,781
Too short?

498
00:53:56,029 --> 00:53:57,086
Chin up.

499
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:00,825
If you succeed,
I'll kill myself instead of Mido.

500
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,700
That's right.

501
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:10,825
I'm going to kill every woman
you love until you die.

502
00:54:12,903 --> 00:54:16,569
Well, you're notorious for not
protecting your women anyway.

503
00:54:23,572 --> 00:54:26,869
Wow, you're strong, Mr. Monster.

504
00:54:27,988 --> 00:54:30,235
Yes, you are the monster
that I created.

505
00:54:32,863 --> 00:54:37,158
But you will never find out why
if you go through with this.

506
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:40,075
You have been curious for 15 years...

507
00:54:40,846 --> 00:54:42,533
Are you still going to kill me?

508
00:54:52,193 --> 00:54:53,322
Sit down there.

509
00:55:00,695 --> 00:55:02,953
Ah, the tooth torture!

510
00:55:04,821 --> 00:55:06,569
You won't have enough time.

511
00:55:07,658 --> 00:55:10,535
I have a pacemaker
for my weak heart.

512
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:12,863
When it was put in...

513
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:17,118
...do you know what I
said to the doctor?

514
00:55:20,405 --> 00:55:21,824
"Dr. Hopkins,

515
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:23,782
give me...

516
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:27,328
...a remote control
to turn my motor off."

517
00:55:27,738 --> 00:55:30,115
"Pardon? Why?"

518
00:55:32,932 --> 00:55:36,869
"So that I can kill myself.
Easily. At any time."

519
00:55:38,136 --> 00:55:40,695
"I'll pay you an extra
$100,000 for this."

520
00:55:55,804 --> 00:55:57,428
What a dilemma.

521
00:55:57,698 --> 00:56:00,615
You want to kill me right now,

522
00:56:00,617 --> 00:56:03,234
but then you won't know
why you were imprisoned.

523
00:56:04,491 --> 00:56:08,077
You want to torture me,
but I say I'll kill myself first.

524
00:56:08,663 --> 00:56:09,720
So?

525
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:13,662
Revenge? Or the truth?

526
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:18,827
What a problem for you.

527
00:56:19,397 --> 00:56:22,274
I've been watching
over you for 15 years.

528
00:56:24,701 --> 00:56:26,619
I've faired well thanks to you.

529
00:56:27,028 --> 00:56:30,405
I wasn't bored or lonely.

530
00:56:33,282 --> 00:56:36,306
Seeking revenge is the best cure
for someone who has been hurt.

531
00:56:37,448 --> 00:56:38,567
Try it.

532
00:56:40,405 --> 00:56:42,653
The loss of 15 years,

533
00:56:43,354 --> 00:56:45,942
the pain of losing
your wife and child,

534
00:56:46,294 --> 00:56:48,592
all this can be forgotten.

535
00:56:49,196 --> 00:56:52,953
Once again,
revenge is good for your health.

536
00:56:53,572 --> 00:56:54,451
But...

537
00:56:56,069 --> 00:56:58,617
What happens after
you've had your revenge?

538
00:56:59,866 --> 00:57:03,322
I bet that hidden pain
probably emerges again.

539
00:57:06,776 --> 00:57:08,364
Are you there, Oh Dae-su?

540
00:57:10,643 --> 00:57:11,812
Oh Dae-su.

541
00:57:12,807 --> 00:57:14,095
Long time no see.

542
00:57:23,322 --> 00:57:26,819
Hasn't she been tied up too long?
You left her door open.

543
00:57:40,766 --> 00:57:42,203
Save me, Dae-su!

544
00:57:44,607 --> 00:57:46,145
<i>I can't. I'm going to die.</i>

545
00:57:56,369 --> 00:57:58,077
This dentist is very good.

546
00:58:06,949 --> 00:58:08,077
Keep still.

547
00:58:08,294 --> 00:58:10,462
Keep still.

548
00:58:11,798 --> 00:58:12,927
What's his problem?

549
00:58:41,925 --> 00:58:43,423
You see...

550
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:46,878
...they say that people

551
00:58:47,554 --> 00:58:50,301
shrivel up because
of their imagination.

552
00:58:51,404 --> 00:58:54,611
So do not imagine anything.

553
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:57,988
You'll become brave as hell.

554
00:58:58,657 --> 00:59:00,285
Now here comes the real thing.

555
00:59:32,714 --> 00:59:36,920
Sir, I'm glad you told
me about this place...

556
00:59:38,527 --> 00:59:40,945
...but I haven't even started yet!

557
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:57,939
Let's go.

558
01:00:14,919 --> 01:00:15,968
Let's go now.

559
01:00:16,949 --> 01:00:18,237
Let's fight.

560
01:00:21,636 --> 01:00:22,765
Let's fight.

561
01:00:28,787 --> 01:00:31,034
- What a tough guy!
- Your hand.

562
01:00:32,323 --> 01:00:33,992
I'll chop off your hand.

563
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:39,236
You touched Mido's breasts.

564
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,930
Let's get out of this dump.

565
01:01:02,054 --> 01:01:04,571
So do you trust me now, you bastard?

566
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:10,843
It looks hard to accomplish.

567
01:01:10,845 --> 01:01:12,525
I looked into it.

568
01:01:12,527 --> 01:01:15,629
The reason the bank
refused to pay $270 million

569
01:01:15,631 --> 01:01:18,168
was not due to any
building irregularities.

570
01:01:18,566 --> 01:01:20,274
They have internal problems.

571
01:01:24,323 --> 01:01:27,700
So I don't think
we'll have any trouble.

572
01:01:28,207 --> 01:01:33,342
Chairman Choi's 23 clients'
shares are at 25% ...

573
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:42,033
Dae-su.

574
01:01:43,402 --> 01:01:44,571
Yeah?

575
01:01:47,698 --> 01:01:50,615
Did he really say that he'd kill me?

576
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:53,572
Yeah.

577
01:01:54,701 --> 01:01:57,158
Because I'm the woman you love?

578
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:04,481
Dae-su.

579
01:02:06,529 --> 01:02:07,698
What?

580
01:02:08,783 --> 01:02:11,744
Where is my love?

581
01:02:13,532 --> 01:02:16,319
I'm getting lonelier in the nights...

582
01:02:20,035 --> 01:02:24,231
The words you send with your eyes...

583
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:28,117
I can feel with my hand...

584
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:32,993
So many nights have passed...

585
01:02:34,361 --> 01:02:37,658
My heart is going to you...

586
01:02:38,957 --> 01:02:42,793
As I shed my sad tears...

587
01:02:43,702 --> 01:02:47,738
You're the face I miss...

588
01:02:52,746 --> 01:02:56,612
They packed up their stuff
and left in a rental car.

589
01:02:58,666 --> 01:03:03,002
Also, Mido called the
restaurant and left her job.

590
01:03:06,767 --> 01:03:09,014
Let's go after this is done.

591
01:03:11,235 --> 01:03:13,283
You should get some rest today, sir.

592
01:03:15,545 --> 01:03:17,333
I can't even sleep.

593
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,084
Because I am lonely.

594
01:03:21,121 --> 01:03:22,370
Mr. Han.

595
01:03:23,702 --> 01:03:25,620
Do you really think...

596
01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:29,567
...that Mido has fallen
in love with Oh Dae-su?

597
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,078
Already?

598
01:03:53,511 --> 01:03:54,760
Dae-su!

599
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,290
It hurts so much.

600
01:03:58,329 --> 01:04:00,537
But I'll endure it.

601
01:04:02,264 --> 01:04:03,773
You must understand.

602
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:21,577
How did you hold out for 15 years?

603
01:04:22,153 --> 01:04:23,662
There's always a way.

604
01:04:25,178 --> 01:04:27,006
Do you like it?

605
01:04:28,654 --> 01:04:30,232
You do like it, don't you?

606
01:04:30,995 --> 01:04:33,112
I want to make you feel good, Dae-su.

607
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:03,992
<i>You need not worry about the future.</i>

608
01:05:05,802 --> 01:05:07,220
<i>Imagine nothing.</i>

609
01:05:18,697 --> 01:05:21,864
<i>I am grateful for all those
years spent in that prison.</i>

610
01:05:24,451 --> 01:05:28,657
<i>If I was the old Oh Dae-su,
would Mido still have liked me?</i>

611
01:07:05,184 --> 01:07:09,890
<i>He could only have known that I said
I would chop off Mr. Park's hand...</i>

612
01:07:10,517 --> 01:07:12,555
<i>by putting a bug on us.</i>

613
01:07:13,325 --> 01:07:15,493
<i>And he knew where
we were by tailing us.</i>

614
01:07:16,114 --> 01:07:17,998
"I'VE BEEN BUGGED. PLEASE FIND IT."

615
01:07:18,282 --> 01:07:19,651
You know,

616
01:07:20,292 --> 01:07:22,370
maybe he freed you...

617
01:07:22,973 --> 01:07:26,559
because he has fun watching you
run wild seeking revenge.

618
01:07:28,533 --> 01:07:32,539
And he'll never tell you why,
so he can toy with you forever.

619
01:07:34,753 --> 01:07:35,922
Is that why?

620
01:07:37,931 --> 01:07:40,653
Evergreen Press,
online printing system.

621
01:07:40,655 --> 01:07:42,401
Evergreen Pasta and Pizza.

622
01:07:42,403 --> 01:07:45,848
Evergreen Services,
for security, parking, cleaning.

623
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:48,767
Evergreen Tree Garden.
Evergreen Old Boys.

624
01:07:49,366 --> 01:07:51,915
Sangnok High School
alumni homepage.

625
01:07:51,917 --> 01:07:55,873
Evergreen Secret Diary,
Jung Sang-rok's personal site.

626
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:57,623
Norwegian Wood, Evergreen...

627
01:08:03,530 --> 01:08:05,200
"WELCOME TO EVERGREEN OLD BOYS"

628
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:08,487
"THE SANGNOK HIGH SCHOOL
ALUMNI HOMEPAGE."

629
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:27,656
I should be locking up now.

630
01:08:27,658 --> 01:08:31,114
Can I just look at the
records for the class of '79?

631
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,487
It's dark. Put the lights on.

632
01:08:42,846 --> 01:08:44,224
Take your time.

633
01:08:44,501 --> 01:08:46,979
"LEE WOO-JIN"

634
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:49,448
Joo-hwan?

635
01:08:49,611 --> 01:08:51,069
Let me ask you something.

636
01:08:52,283 --> 01:08:54,491
Do you remember
Lee Woo-jin from school?

637
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,198
I think he went to study in America.

638
01:08:58,157 --> 01:08:59,196
Lee Woo-jin?

639
01:09:00,732 --> 01:09:03,529
I don't know him.
So is that the bastard's name?

640
01:09:04,478 --> 01:09:05,727
How did you find out?

641
01:09:06,493 --> 01:09:09,076
I looked through all
the school yearbooks.

642
01:09:09,514 --> 01:09:12,630
I need more than just a name.

643
01:09:12,632 --> 01:09:14,090
Got anything else?

644
01:09:14,304 --> 01:09:17,318
Look at the student records.

645
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,317
Do you know Lee Soo-ah?
She was in our year.

646
01:09:20,535 --> 01:09:21,574
Lee Soo-ah?

647
01:09:22,363 --> 01:09:23,662
She died.

648
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,184
- What classroom was she in?
- Room two, I think.

649
01:09:27,186 --> 01:09:28,850
She was in my room.

650
01:09:28,852 --> 01:09:31,909
Next to yours.
So what about her?

651
01:09:33,904 --> 01:09:35,030
Why is there no photo?

652
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:40,155
She died. That must be why.

653
01:09:40,768 --> 01:09:42,056
How did Lee Soo-ah die?

654
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:47,328
Yeah, you wouldn't know.
She died after you moved schools.

655
01:09:48,827 --> 01:09:55,948
She went to the Habchun Dam alone
and fell into the water. She bit the dust.

656
01:09:59,198 --> 01:10:03,702
One week later, they found
her bloated body in the water.

657
01:10:04,592 --> 01:10:06,989
- What was she like?
- Her?

658
01:10:07,219 --> 01:10:09,444
She was a total slut.

659
01:10:09,446 --> 01:10:13,202
On the outside,
she acted like a lady,

660
01:10:13,204 --> 01:10:16,751
but inside she was
just a filthy whore.

661
01:10:16,753 --> 01:10:21,248
The rumour going around school
was that she'd fuck anyone.

662
01:10:23,106 --> 01:10:25,354
I should have got in there.

663
01:10:27,298 --> 01:10:31,754
I also heard that her
family was filthy rich.

664
01:10:32,563 --> 01:10:34,481
Her grades were good, too.

665
01:10:34,666 --> 01:10:38,702
But the worst thing was
that she was a total slut.

666
01:10:39,312 --> 01:10:42,059
God, this is such an old story.

667
01:10:42,266 --> 01:10:45,763
Dae-su, I can't remember
because it was so long ago,

668
01:10:46,064 --> 01:10:48,152
but that Soo-ah, well...

669
01:11:03,322 --> 01:11:05,320
Joo-hwan, what is it?

670
01:11:06,203 --> 01:11:10,865
Joo-hwan, is something wrong?

671
01:11:16,023 --> 01:11:19,102
Oh Dae-su.

672
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:22,078
My sister...

673
01:11:23,353 --> 01:11:25,061
...was no slut.

674
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:28,728
You must believe that.

675
01:11:31,882 --> 01:11:35,838
You got rid of your bug so
I had to come all the way here.

676
01:11:36,739 --> 01:11:38,947
To eavesdrop.

677
01:11:39,442 --> 01:11:41,310
That's why Joo-hwan is dead...

678
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:44,789
...because of you.

679
01:11:46,178 --> 01:11:47,257
OK?

680
01:11:59,456 --> 01:12:01,504
You bastard, I'm coming for you!

681
01:12:02,446 --> 01:12:06,822
I'm going to kill you!

682
01:12:27,238 --> 01:12:28,678
You son of a bitch!

683
01:12:49,636 --> 01:12:53,092
We're not open yet.
Come back in an hour, please.

684
01:12:53,846 --> 01:12:57,302
This place was recommended
by someone with six gold teeth.

685
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:07,088
Mr. Park?

686
01:13:08,525 --> 01:13:10,323
I had to move because of you.

687
01:13:11,497 --> 01:13:13,335
To celebrate the occasion...

688
01:13:14,606 --> 01:13:16,644
...I installed a new TV.

689
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:18,618
Do you like it?

690
01:13:19,946 --> 01:13:23,162
It's got so many channels.
Great, isn't it?

691
01:13:23,487 --> 01:13:26,066
Some prisoners don't
want to leave at all.

692
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:29,355
You lived in a place like this
for 15 years, Dae-su?

693
01:13:29,996 --> 01:13:32,283
After 11 years, it felt like home.

694
01:13:33,403 --> 01:13:37,319
Come on, I don't need your money.

695
01:13:38,075 --> 01:13:40,453
My enemy's enemy is my friend.

696
01:13:45,973 --> 01:13:48,442
We threw away the hand
because it rotted.

697
01:13:48,444 --> 01:13:49,693
I've missed you.

698
01:13:51,107 --> 01:13:54,154
Bastard. You'll pay for this.

699
01:13:57,724 --> 01:14:00,261
So why did you bring me here?

700
01:14:06,755 --> 01:14:10,171
If I don't return after July 5th,
let her go.

701
01:14:14,745 --> 01:14:18,621
While I was locked up here,
I remember someone visiting me.

702
01:14:19,814 --> 01:14:21,903
What did that person do?

703
01:14:21,905 --> 01:14:23,608
Was it three times?

704
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:28,367
I put a hypnosis-inducing
drug in your water.

705
01:14:28,369 --> 01:14:29,918
Sodium barbiturate?

706
01:14:31,204 --> 01:14:32,243
He's a genius!

707
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:46,678
"WATERWHEEL HAIR SALON"

708
01:14:54,367 --> 01:14:55,740
That's rubbish.

709
01:14:56,344 --> 01:14:58,493
Even though it was a Catholic school,

710
01:14:58,909 --> 01:15:01,494
those rumours wouldn't
have killed her.

711
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:04,111
There was probably something else.

712
01:15:05,344 --> 01:15:08,887
Could she have been pregnant, maybe?

713
01:15:10,571 --> 01:15:14,723
I really don't think
Soo-ah was like that.

714
01:15:15,001 --> 01:15:19,746
She was such a pure girl.
I know she never went with anyone.

715
01:15:21,223 --> 01:15:25,719
But she did go out
with someone back then.

716
01:15:28,387 --> 01:15:29,966
Do you want to know who he was?

717
01:15:31,534 --> 01:15:33,362
I haven't got a clue!

718
01:15:46,907 --> 01:15:47,946
Choon-shim.

719
01:15:49,308 --> 01:15:52,725
You knew Lee Soo-ah, didn't you?
Who was her boyfriend?

720
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:55,383
You don't know?

721
01:15:56,157 --> 01:15:58,144
You silly cow.

722
01:15:58,146 --> 01:16:02,363
You don't know because
friendship means nothing to you.

723
01:16:02,365 --> 01:16:03,414
Shut up.

724
01:16:03,749 --> 01:16:05,417
Who would know?

725
01:16:06,626 --> 01:16:07,745
Who?

726
01:16:07,968 --> 01:16:09,136
Joo-hwan?

727
01:16:12,871 --> 01:16:14,449
What?

728
01:16:16,317 --> 01:16:18,275
Yeah, I know him.

729
01:16:19,816 --> 01:16:21,314
But why would he know?

730
01:16:22,741 --> 01:16:23,620
Yeah?

731
01:16:24,566 --> 01:16:25,645
Really?

732
01:16:26,529 --> 01:16:28,787
OK. I'll call you back in a bit.

733
01:16:35,413 --> 01:16:36,672
Well...

734
01:16:38,043 --> 01:16:40,791
She said it was Joo-hwan
who told her the rumours

735
01:16:41,591 --> 01:16:44,168
and that you should know
more than anyone.

736
01:16:58,869 --> 01:17:00,785
<i>Ring, ring.</i>

737
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:02,876
<i>Move aside.</i>

738
01:17:06,366 --> 01:17:07,995
<i>You'll get hurt...</i>

739
01:17:11,348 --> 01:17:12,767
<i>...if you get in the way.</i>

740
01:17:24,031 --> 01:17:26,409
"OH DAE-SU"

741
01:17:42,345 --> 01:17:43,793
Good Lord!

742
01:17:43,795 --> 01:17:46,672
You rascal. Put it out!

743
01:17:46,994 --> 01:17:51,029
I'm leaving today. For Seoul.

744
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:54,539
So just you leave me alone, missy.

745
01:17:55,441 --> 01:17:56,810
You good-for-nothing!

746
01:18:53,933 --> 01:18:55,691
You're Oh Dae-su, aren't you?

747
01:18:57,656 --> 01:18:59,922
And you are...

748
01:18:59,924 --> 01:19:02,171
I heard you're popular with the girls.

749
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:06,593
You know what rumours are like.

750
01:19:06,595 --> 01:19:09,722
I heard you're really funny.
Say something.

751
01:19:11,554 --> 01:19:16,219
It's not good to be
stuck with one image.

752
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:28,547
OK, there's this father and son.

753
01:19:28,549 --> 01:19:31,296
They went to the swimming pool and...

754
01:19:31,646 --> 01:19:32,775
See you later.

755
01:19:56,019 --> 01:20:02,353
"TAKE CARE FUCKHEADS OF
YEAR 3, CLASS 3."

756
01:20:58,737 --> 01:21:00,955
- Come on.
- Wait.

757
01:21:03,515 --> 01:21:05,683
- Come here.
- No.

758
01:21:08,427 --> 01:21:09,683
Come here.

759
01:21:09,685 --> 01:21:11,273
OK, OK.

760
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,239
Satisfied?

761
01:21:22,178 --> 01:21:24,390
- Lift this up.
- No way.

762
01:21:24,392 --> 01:21:26,050
- Lift it up.
- No.

763
01:21:41,102 --> 01:21:42,141
What?

764
01:21:50,695 --> 01:21:52,453
That tickles.

765
01:22:21,625 --> 01:22:22,994
Give me those.

766
01:22:28,352 --> 01:22:29,761
What are you doing?

767
01:22:29,941 --> 01:22:31,109
Let me see.

768
01:22:31,111 --> 01:22:32,400
What are you doing?

769
01:22:33,502 --> 01:22:35,260
- Let me see.
- Stop it!

770
01:22:46,384 --> 01:22:47,683
Go away.

771
01:24:29,612 --> 01:24:31,940
Was it really Soo-ah? Are you sure?

772
01:24:32,783 --> 01:24:34,321
I don't know her name.

773
01:24:35,123 --> 01:24:39,129
I just know that she's in your
class and she rides a red bike.

774
01:24:47,072 --> 01:24:49,740
Have a good trip.
See you in Seoul.

775
01:24:49,926 --> 01:24:51,384
Where are you going?

776
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:53,424
I've got a date with Choon-shim.

777
01:24:54,606 --> 01:24:56,564
I'll kill you if you blab to anyone.

778
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:02,829
No way.

779
01:25:04,844 --> 01:25:08,260
You got locked up for 15 years
just for saying that?

780
01:25:10,965 --> 01:25:12,673
Is that such a crime?

781
01:25:15,586 --> 01:25:18,365
"Whether it be a grain
of sand or a rock,

782
01:25:18,367 --> 01:25:20,405
in water they both sink alike."

783
01:25:23,891 --> 01:25:25,969
That's Lee Woo-jin's attitude.

784
01:25:28,071 --> 01:25:29,490
So,

785
01:25:30,129 --> 01:25:32,087
what's the significance of July 5th?

786
01:25:33,588 --> 01:25:35,126
That's the day...

787
01:25:38,102 --> 01:25:39,771
...Lee Soo-ah died.

788
01:25:45,291 --> 01:25:47,049
It's over now.

789
01:25:47,591 --> 01:25:49,700
You were fighting for the truth,

790
01:25:49,702 --> 01:25:51,818
not for revenge, weren't you?

791
01:25:54,471 --> 01:25:58,387
Now, we'll run away where
Woo-jin can never follow us.

792
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:03,689
<i>I can't end it like this.</i>

793
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:07,097
Vengeance has become a part of me.

794
01:26:12,744 --> 01:26:15,451
But you don't even
know where he lives.

795
01:26:16,942 --> 01:26:20,318
<i>"Like a gazelle from the
hand of the hunter...</i>

796
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:23,527
<i>"Like a bird from the
snare of the fowler...</i>

797
01:26:23,872 --> 01:26:24,951
<i>"Free yourself. "</i>

798
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:30,720
<i>It is taken from the Book of Proverbs,
chapter six, verse four.</i>

799
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:32,315
<i>And Evergreen...</i>

800
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,198
<i>...said he lives in a high tower.</i>

801
01:26:36,409 --> 01:26:38,737
<i>So six and four...</i>

802
01:26:39,901 --> 01:26:41,189
<i>...must be floors.</i>

803
01:26:42,648 --> 01:26:43,687
<i>Fourth floor.</i>

804
01:26:45,037 --> 01:26:46,416
<i>Sixth floor.</i>

805
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,739
<i>Or the 64th floor?</i>

806
01:26:51,791 --> 01:26:52,840
<i>P?</i>

807
01:26:53,464 --> 01:26:54,753
<i>Penthouse!</i>

808
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:00,248
Please insert the code.

809
01:27:06,839 --> 01:27:09,486
What would you like me to pray for?

810
01:27:12,275 --> 01:27:13,524
Wrong entry.

811
01:27:14,223 --> 01:27:16,261
Please re-enter.

812
01:27:21,374 --> 01:27:24,971
Wrong entry. Please re-enter.

813
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:26,419
"Dear Lord...

814
01:27:28,655 --> 01:27:30,073
...please let me...

815
01:27:31,485 --> 01:27:33,903
...meet a younger man next time."

816
01:28:24,199 --> 01:28:25,958
Please make Woo-jin...

817
01:28:27,146 --> 01:28:28,855
...kneel before Dae-su...

818
01:28:30,548 --> 01:28:33,375
...and beg for forgiveness.

819
01:28:47,110 --> 01:28:48,739
You slept with your sister.

820
01:29:00,181 --> 01:29:01,850
Let's go upstairs and talk.

821
01:29:25,142 --> 01:29:26,231
Get him!

822
01:29:49,113 --> 01:29:51,281
Just talk.

823
01:30:22,117 --> 01:30:23,656
That's better.

824
01:30:25,812 --> 01:30:27,480
You slept with your sister.

825
01:30:27,638 --> 01:30:28,887
So refreshing.

826
01:30:35,627 --> 01:30:38,044
And I started the rumours.

827
01:30:39,025 --> 01:30:40,734
That's why your sister died.

828
01:30:48,281 --> 01:30:51,118
Looking in the mirror
reminds me of that day.

829
01:30:52,142 --> 01:30:53,214
How about you?

830
01:30:53,216 --> 01:30:57,432
Erasing my memory and telling
me to find the truth was cowardly.

831
01:30:59,111 --> 01:31:00,400
I won...

832
01:31:02,809 --> 01:31:04,727
...so die like you promised.

833
01:31:04,883 --> 01:31:08,349
Did you think you'd forgotten that
day because you were hypnotized?

834
01:31:10,013 --> 01:31:10,893
Really?

835
01:31:12,586 --> 01:31:15,503
Do you know the real reason
why you can't remember?

836
01:31:18,842 --> 01:31:19,961
It's because...

837
01:31:24,412 --> 01:31:25,871
...you just forgot.

838
01:31:26,775 --> 01:31:28,787
Is that not exciting enough for you?

839
01:31:29,490 --> 01:31:32,537
Well, it's true, you just forgot.

840
01:31:32,944 --> 01:31:35,531
Why? Because it wasn't
important to you.

841
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:38,769
Your rumour got so out of hand,

842
01:31:38,771 --> 01:31:42,057
that the next rumour was
that Soo-ah was pregnant.

843
01:31:42,343 --> 01:31:46,799
My sister got sucked into that
rumour and began believing it.

844
01:31:47,287 --> 01:31:50,954
So her periods stopped
and her belly began to swell.

845
01:31:52,093 --> 01:31:53,632
Fascinating, isn't it?

846
01:31:53,870 --> 01:31:57,616
Imagine how a girl would feel to
carry both her child and her nephew.

847
01:31:57,988 --> 01:31:59,526
Do you understand now?

848
01:32:00,705 --> 01:32:04,531
Your tongue got my sister pregnant.

849
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:08,847
It wasn't Lee Woo-jin's dick.

850
01:32:10,585 --> 01:32:11,954
It was Oh Dae-su's tongue.

851
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:19,700
Is that why you killed your sister?

852
01:32:20,175 --> 01:32:24,131
Imagine how a boy would feel,
fathering both his child and his nephew?

853
01:32:28,531 --> 01:32:29,990
You were probably afraid.

854
01:32:30,598 --> 01:32:33,635
Afraid that everyone would know
once the baby was born.

855
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:38,708
After you killed her, you realised
it was a phantom pregnancy...

856
01:32:40,002 --> 01:32:41,630
...so your hating me...

857
01:32:43,763 --> 01:32:44,826
...is understandable.

858
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:52,672
They said Soo-ah
died alone at the dam,

859
01:32:53,545 --> 01:32:54,924
so who took this photo?

860
01:32:56,755 --> 01:32:58,633
And what about the date, July 5th?

861
01:33:06,279 --> 01:33:08,617
This is no fun.

862
01:33:09,552 --> 01:33:11,880
I'll just finish what I was saying.

863
01:33:12,487 --> 01:33:15,194
Listen carefully.
My story is really exciting.

864
01:33:15,704 --> 01:33:18,168
Ever heard of
post-hypnotic suggestion?

865
01:33:18,170 --> 01:33:20,564
You suggest something
during hypnosis,

866
01:33:20,566 --> 01:33:22,814
then it's performed
in your wakened state.

867
01:33:24,718 --> 01:33:26,426
Still haven't worked it out?

868
01:33:32,982 --> 01:33:36,169
You let a stranger into your home.
Who are you?

869
01:33:36,348 --> 01:33:38,941
<i>What about you, you bastard?</i>

870
01:33:44,282 --> 01:33:46,820
We hypnotized both of you.

871
01:33:48,442 --> 01:33:54,368
One fortunate thing was that, compared to others,
both of you were receptive to hypnosis.

872
01:33:56,258 --> 01:33:57,547
Isn't this fun?

873
01:33:57,690 --> 01:34:01,816
One word gets you pregnant.
Another makes you fall in love.

874
01:34:04,895 --> 01:34:09,319
But no matter how receptive
you two were to hypnosis,

875
01:34:09,321 --> 01:34:12,651
and no matter how good
a hypnotist Miss Yoo is,

876
01:34:12,653 --> 01:34:15,900
getting people to
fall in love isn't easy.

877
01:34:18,093 --> 01:34:19,512
Do you know how we did it?

878
01:34:23,031 --> 01:34:25,535
Your first suggestion, of course,

879
01:34:25,537 --> 01:34:27,535
was to go to that restaurant

880
01:34:27,537 --> 01:34:30,124
straight after your release.

881
01:34:31,448 --> 01:34:34,535
Next, to react to the
mobile phone's ringtone.

882
01:34:35,793 --> 01:34:39,839
When you heard this,
you were programmed to say something.

883
01:34:41,263 --> 01:34:42,302
Who are you?

884
01:34:44,270 --> 01:34:47,517
Do you... like your clothes?

885
01:34:48,625 --> 01:34:53,540
And Mido was programmed to react
to the man who would say this.

886
01:34:53,894 --> 01:34:57,440
When she touched your hand,
your reaction would be...

887
01:35:01,514 --> 01:35:04,601
Your gravest mistake wasn't
failing to find the answer.

888
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:11,372
If you keep asking the wrong questions,
you'll never find the right answer.

889
01:35:11,374 --> 01:35:15,960
It's not,
"Why did Woo-jin imprison me?"

890
01:35:16,466 --> 01:35:19,113
It's "Why did he release me?"

891
01:35:19,367 --> 01:35:21,235
Once again...

892
01:35:22,241 --> 01:35:26,317
...why did Woo-jin
release Dae-su after...

893
01:35:28,307 --> 01:35:29,506
...15 years?

894
01:37:31,324 --> 01:37:34,721
"LAUGH, AND THE WORLD LAUGHS WITH YOU.
WEEP, AND YOU WEEP ALONE."

895
01:39:15,725 --> 01:39:17,013
Mr. Han.

896
01:39:25,797 --> 01:39:27,295
Mr. Han!

897
01:40:08,034 --> 01:40:09,283
Mido...

898
01:40:16,185 --> 01:40:17,554
Mido doesn't know?

899
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,928
Why did you hide her there?

900
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:30,096
Did you think he'd hate me
just because I cut off his hand?

901
01:40:30,492 --> 01:40:32,650
Didn't you work out
that it was a trap?

902
01:40:35,058 --> 01:40:38,265
How can you protect your
woman with that brain?

903
01:40:39,806 --> 01:40:43,632
I've secretly been raising
Mido since she was three.

904
01:40:44,978 --> 01:40:46,976
What's wrong with you?

905
01:40:48,161 --> 01:40:49,790
Mr. Park's hand?

906
01:40:51,294 --> 01:40:52,983
You moron.

907
01:40:53,998 --> 01:40:58,445
Did you see his new prison?
I gave him that building for his hand!

908
01:40:58,447 --> 01:40:59,656
ME!

909
01:41:24,460 --> 01:41:25,669
Dae-su!

910
01:41:27,755 --> 01:41:31,952
In front of me there's
some kind of box.

911
01:41:31,954 --> 01:41:33,782
He's telling me to open it.

912
01:41:34,492 --> 01:41:36,167
It's the same violet box...

913
01:41:36,169 --> 01:41:37,128
NO!

914
01:41:38,304 --> 01:41:43,346
No, Mido, don't.
Don't open it, no matter what.

915
01:41:43,348 --> 01:41:45,807
Or something terrible will happen.

916
01:41:45,809 --> 01:41:47,158
What's in it?

917
01:41:48,071 --> 01:41:49,476
You know, don't you?

918
01:41:49,478 --> 01:41:52,560
Mido, just wait a little longer.

919
01:41:52,562 --> 01:41:57,487
Dae-su will be there soon.
I'll be there very soon.

920
01:41:59,526 --> 01:42:01,734
Can't you come now?

921
01:42:04,201 --> 01:42:05,410
I'm scared.

922
01:42:05,732 --> 01:42:07,920
Little Mido, you can wait, can't you?

923
01:42:07,922 --> 01:42:09,040
Yes.

924
01:42:09,741 --> 01:42:12,028
Very good. Good girl.

925
01:42:13,301 --> 01:42:16,928
I'll call you back very soon, OK?

926
01:42:32,133 --> 01:42:33,182
Please.

927
01:42:36,604 --> 01:42:38,312
Don't tell Mido.

928
01:42:43,010 --> 01:42:44,679
What has she done wrong?

929
01:42:47,198 --> 01:42:48,747
You know it was all my fault.

930
01:42:52,876 --> 01:42:54,244
I have...

931
01:42:55,892 --> 01:42:58,059
...committed an unforgivable sin...

932
01:42:59,011 --> 01:43:00,800
...against your sister!

933
01:43:02,684 --> 01:43:04,762
And I also...

934
01:43:06,155 --> 01:43:07,524
...did you wrong.

935
01:43:09,283 --> 01:43:10,332
But...

936
01:43:12,206 --> 01:43:14,503
...please leave Mido alone.

937
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:21,179
If by any chance...

938
01:43:22,678 --> 01:43:24,676
...Mido finds out the truth,

939
01:43:25,728 --> 01:43:27,726
you son of a bitch,

940
01:43:28,287 --> 01:43:31,914
I'll tear you limb from limb!

941
01:43:32,801 --> 01:43:37,181
And your remains will never be found.

942
01:43:37,492 --> 01:43:38,771
Why?

943
01:43:38,959 --> 01:43:41,626
Because I'm going to
swallow every last bit.

944
01:43:44,277 --> 01:43:45,396
Woo-jin!

945
01:43:46,358 --> 01:43:48,816
Please, sir, I made a mistake.

946
01:43:48,818 --> 01:43:51,905
Please forget what I said.

947
01:43:52,115 --> 01:43:54,443
Sir! Woo-jin!

948
01:43:54,445 --> 01:43:59,368
We're Evergreen Old Boys, remember?

949
01:44:00,968 --> 01:44:07,011
With the energy
of a green pine tree

950
01:44:10,034 --> 01:44:14,500
The Great Sangnok High...

951
01:44:17,198 --> 01:44:20,260
I'll do whatever you want.

952
01:44:20,575 --> 01:44:22,703
I'll do anything. I beg you.

953
01:44:23,506 --> 01:44:28,823
Woo-jin, if you want me
to be your dog, I will!

954
01:44:28,825 --> 01:44:32,571
From this moment on,
I am Woo-jin's dog!

955
01:44:32,573 --> 01:44:34,111
I'm your bitch.

956
01:44:40,521 --> 01:44:42,679
Look, I'm wagging my tail.

957
01:44:43,326 --> 01:44:46,327
I'm a dog. I'll guard your house.

958
01:44:46,329 --> 01:44:48,947
I'll be your slave.

959
01:46:56,613 --> 01:46:58,071
The box...

960
01:47:03,702 --> 01:47:05,120
...just leave it closed.

961
01:47:16,092 --> 01:47:17,141
Now...

962
01:47:20,226 --> 01:47:22,524
...what will I live for?

963
01:48:25,250 --> 01:48:26,419
Dae-su.

964
01:48:26,829 --> 01:48:28,497
It hurts so much.

965
01:48:29,383 --> 01:48:31,211
But I'll endure it.

966
01:48:32,306 --> 01:48:33,675
You must understand.

967
01:48:57,898 --> 01:49:01,184
My sister and I loved each other,
despite everything.

968
01:49:05,673 --> 01:49:07,341
Can you two do the same?

969
01:49:51,054 --> 01:49:52,093
Soo-ah.

970
01:50:07,523 --> 01:50:08,722
Woo-jin.

971
01:50:10,624 --> 01:50:12,622
I know you've always been afraid.

972
01:50:15,459 --> 01:50:18,206
So just let go of me.

973
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:38,077
Please remember me.

974
01:50:46,597 --> 01:50:49,304
I have no regrets. Do you?

975
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:37,829
<i>This is the whole adventure
of my life until now.</i>

976
01:51:38,762 --> 01:51:42,298
<i>Thank you for listening to
this terrible story to the end.</i>

977
01:51:43,153 --> 01:51:47,569
<i>I trust that you will
understand my sending a letter</i>

978
01:51:47,571 --> 01:51:50,682
<i>instead of talking to you in person.</i>

979
01:51:51,336 --> 01:51:53,340
<i>This is because
I have no tongue.</i>

980
01:51:53,342 --> 01:51:56,350
To be honest,
there's no reason I should help you.

981
01:52:02,051 --> 01:52:03,430
But there was one thing.

982
01:52:04,704 --> 01:52:06,992
I was touched by this last sentence.

983
01:52:08,896 --> 01:52:14,215
"EVEN THOUGH I'M NO BETTER THAN A BEAST,

984
01:52:14,216 --> 01:52:18,402
DON'T I HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE?"

985
01:52:21,282 --> 01:52:24,279
The hypnosis may go wrong
and distort your memories.

986
01:52:26,175 --> 01:52:27,464
Do you want to proceed?

987
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:50,508
If you're ready...

988
01:52:52,355 --> 01:52:54,353
...look at that tree.

989
01:53:11,288 --> 01:53:12,537
The tree...

990
01:53:13,582 --> 01:53:16,629
...is slowly changing
into a concrete pillar.

991
01:53:25,269 --> 01:53:29,185
You're now inside
Lee Woo-jin's penthouse.

992
01:53:30,326 --> 01:53:31,985
It's a dreary night.

993
01:53:35,276 --> 01:53:40,071
The sound of your footsteps crossing
to the window fills the room.

994
01:53:54,202 --> 01:53:57,739
When I ring my bell...

995
01:53:59,167 --> 01:54:02,044
...you'll split into two people.

996
01:54:06,178 --> 01:54:09,555
One person doesn't know
your secret: Oh Dae-su.

997
01:54:10,811 --> 01:54:13,638
The one who knows your
secret is the monster.

998
01:54:15,090 --> 01:54:20,131
When I ring the bell again, the monster
will turn around and start walking.

999
01:54:25,448 --> 01:54:31,242
With each step,
he will age by one year.

1000
01:54:31,592 --> 01:54:34,432
When he reaches 70,
the monster will die.

1001
01:54:34,996 --> 01:54:36,494
There's no need to worry.

1002
01:54:37,350 --> 01:54:40,057
It will be a very peaceful death.

1003
01:54:47,797 --> 01:54:49,305
Now, good luck to you.

1004
01:55:32,023 --> 01:55:34,071
What's going on?

1005
01:55:35,011 --> 01:55:37,049
Look at you.

1006
01:56:06,148 --> 01:56:07,777
Who were you with?

1007
01:57:03,635 --> 01:57:05,133
I love you...

1008
01:57:06,265 --> 01:57:07,514
...Dae-su...
