00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,389
Jangshemash.

2
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:56,932
My name a Borat.

3
00:00:57,016 --> 00:01:00,478
My life is nice. Not.

4
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,980
But how I end up like this?

5
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,483
<i>14 year ago,</i>

6
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:09,612
<i>I release a moviefilm which was
great success in US&A.</i>

7
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:14,325
<i>But Kazakhstan become a
laughingstocks around the world.</i>

8
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:18,496
<i>Our exports of potassium
and pubis plummet.</i>

9
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:22,208
<i>Many brokers leapt
from our tallest skyscrapers.</i>

10
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,546
<i>Since Running of Jew
had been canceled,</i>

11
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,884
<i>all Kazakhstan had left was
Holocaust Remembrance Day,</i>

12
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:35,012
<i>where we commemorate
our heroic soldiers</i>

13
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,515
<i>who ran the camps.</i>

14
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,559
<i>I was blamed
for Kazakhstan's failure</i>

15
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:43,354
<i>and banned from
ever make reportings again.</i>

16
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,816
<i>I was publicly humiliate.</i>

17
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,568
Ow! Wawaweewa!

18
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:53,405
<i>I was sentence for life
to hard labor in gulag.</i>

19
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:57,117
<i>But 14 year later,
men from government</i>

20
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,995
<i>bring me to presidential palace.</i>

21
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:07,878
<i>Premier Nazarbayev!</i>

22
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,130
<i>Listen carefully, asshole.</i>

23
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,967
<i>I have a mission for you.</i>

24
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,177
<i>He explain that,
while I was in gulag,</i>

25
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:18,097
<i>US&A was ruin by an evil man</i>

26
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,267
<i>who stood against
all American values.</i>

27
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,685
His name?

28
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,728
<i>Barack Obama.</i>

29
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:29,233
<i>This led to other Africans
becoming political leaders.</i>

30
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:33,112
<i>But then a miracle occurred.</i>

31
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:37,992
<i>A magnificent new premier name
McDonald Trump rose to power</i>

32
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,327
<i>and made America great again.</i>

33
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:42,288
<i>He also became buddies</i>

34
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,206
<i>with tough-guy leaders
across the world:</i>

35
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,499
<i>Putin,</i>

36
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,834
<i>Kim Jong-un,</i>

37
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,335
<i>Bolsonaro</i>

38
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,837
<i>and Kenneth West.</i>

39
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,339
<i>Everyone apart from me.</i>

40
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:53,924
<i>You, Sagdiyev...</i>

41
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,969
<i>will return to US&A
to deliver a gift</i>

42
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:00,514
<i>so that Kazakhstan will earn
the respect of Trump.</i>

43
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:03,183
<i>I was instruct
not to give the gift to Trump,</i>

44
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,852
<i>since, on previous mission,</i>

45
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,939
<i>I had accidentally made shit
in front his house.</i>

46
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,692
So, it must go to
someone in his inner circle.

47
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,695
<i>America's most famous
ladies man -</i>

48
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,781
<i>Michael Pence.</i>
- <i>The vice premier</i>

49
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,617
<i>was known to be
such a pussy hound</i>

50
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,829
<i>that he could not be left alone
in a room with a womans.</i>

51
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:25,998
What is the gift?

52
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,917
Johnny the Monkey.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,919
<i>Johnny the Monkey,</i>

54
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,629
<i>Kazakhstan's Minister of Culture</i>

55
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,214
<i>and number one porno star.</i>

56
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:38,302
<i>A cameraman will follow you to
document your mission.</i>

57
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,722
<i>I will need my producer,
Azamat Bagatov.</i>

58
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,307
Impossible.

59
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,308
Why?

60
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,601
You are sitting on him.

61
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,690
Also, get me a chocolate cake.

62
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:54,151
Now, get him ready!

63
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:03,118
These gypsy tears will
keep you safe.

64
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:18,342
<i>Before I make
commencings my mission,</i>

65
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:21,637
<i>I returned to my village
in order to give kiss</i>

66
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,807
<i>to my sons and make sexy time
with my wife.</i>

67
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,434
<i>I'm back, everybody!
I'm back!</i>

68
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:31,522
<i>But I discovered that my
neighbor, Nursultan Tulyakbay,</i>

69
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,024
<i>had taken everything from me:</i>

70
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:37,778
<i>My Mikhael the Mouse pajamas
and my sons,</i>

71
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,614
<i>Bilak, Biram and Hueylewis.</i>

72
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:42,116
That not my name anymore.

73
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,325
I'm so ashamed of you,

74
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:44,451
<i>I change it to...</i>

75
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,119
<i>Jeffrey</i>

76
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,453
<i>Epstein.</i>

77
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,962
<i>All I had left
was my livestocks:</i>

78
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,589
<i>Two pigs, one cow</i>

79
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:58,966
<i>and a daughter.</i>

80
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,761
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

81
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,681
<i>there was a lowly peasant girl
called Melania</i>

82
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,766
<i>from shithole country Slovenia</i>

83
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,145
<i>who dreamed of marrying
a rich old man.</i>

84
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,315
I have a non-male son?

85
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,443
Daddy?

86
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:20,029
Why are you living like this?

87
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:24,033
Because I have no husband to
put me in a beautiful wife cage.

88
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:26,368
Unlike that bitch,
Lilyat Sakanov!

89
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:28,328
Mm.

90
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,412
How old are you?

91
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:30,914
Fifteen.

92
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,374
Fifteen?!?

93
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,878
<i>You're the oldest unmarried
woman in all Kazakhstan!</i>

94
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:39,465
I'm so happy that you're back.

95
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:42,384
<i>I'm not.
I'm off to US&A.</i>

96
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:43,844
Please take me with you!

97
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,596
Not possible.

98
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,685
Please Daddy.

99
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,230
<i>Here...</i>

100
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:59,068
<i>have a piece of onion instead.</i>
- Sagdiyev.

101
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,819
Johnny's in the crate.

102
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,071
You must leave now.

103
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:05,783
Uh... nice to meet you.

104
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,370
I go to America!

105
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,832
Go to hell, Sagdiyev!

106
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,375
Don't bother coming back
this time!

107
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,175
<i>Get lost!
May all your shits have antlers!</i>

108
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:26,345
<i>It was time for me
to return to Yankeeland</i>

109
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:29,556
<i>to save my peoples.</i>

110
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:39,108
<i>While Johnny traveled
by luxury cruise ship,</i>

111
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:44,238
<i>I was placed on cargo boat
and arrived 22 days later.</i>

112
00:06:56,416 --> 00:07:01,004
<i>That afternoon, I procure
a sleeping apartment for Johnny</i>

113
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,881
<i>and transform it
into accommodation</i>

114
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:06,426
<i>- suitable for an ape of his stature.
- Welcome to US&A!</i>

115
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:14,351
<i>While waiting for Johnny,</i>

116
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,397
<i>I decide to make inspection
of nearest village.</i>

117
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,053
<i>My name a Borat.
What do you say?</i>

118
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,608
- Borat.
- No, it's not me.

119
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:24,820
<i>High five.
No, that's...</i>

120
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,029
I must go.

121
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,364
There was problem.

122
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,950
People make recognize my face.

123
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,203
Not me.

124
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,568
<i>I'll pay you a dollar
for an autograph.</i>

125
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,236
- You make mistake.
- Can I get an autograph?

126
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,250
<i>It not me.
Yeah, it somebody else.</i>

127
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,421
Or maybe it was gray suit.

128
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,922
Borat!

129
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,412
- I'm not Borat.
- Borat! -Yeah, you are.

130
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:46,872
- Yeah, you are. Can't deny it.
- I'm not Borat.

131
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:49,386
<i>How would I do</i>

132
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,431
<i>my secretive mission
if I was famous?</i>

133
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:56,101
I would need disguises.

134
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:57,477
- Ah.
- What is this?

135
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,354
- That almost looks like you.
- What is that?

136
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,523
"Stupid foreigner reporter"?

137
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,483
Yeah. Kind of looks like you.

138
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,152
You got the dark hair
and the mustache.

139
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,321
No, but this is not like me.

140
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,531
I mean, it does look like you.

141
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:10,782
No?

142
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,955
Take care.

143
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,541
<i>You're welcome.
Have a good day.</i>

144
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,169
<i>Much had changed
since I was last in US&A.</i>

145
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:26,548
<i>America had become
calculator crazy.</i>

146
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:32,471
<i>I needed to make purchasings
of an electrical abacus.</i>

147
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,848
<i>I think we could get rid
of this one for $30.</i>

148
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,391
Ah. Mm-hmm.

149
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:39,019
- What this?
<i>- FaceTime.</i>

150
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,312
Yes?

151
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,189
- And now...
- Hello?

152
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,774
- Hello.
- Who this?

153
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,359
This is Brian.

154
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,611
<i>Hello. I talk to him.
Please be quiet.</i>

155
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:51,531
<i>Hello? Ghost with blue shirt,
answer me.</i>

156
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,492
You are demon?

157
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,255
<i>This guy that you're seeing
in the phone...</i>

158
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,745
- Please be quiet.
<i>- ...is me.</i>

159
00:08:56,828 --> 00:09:00,082
- What?
- If I say something, he says something.

160
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,877
Brian Brother, please,
you must be quiet.

161
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,338
Speakings not polite.

162
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,758
<i>So I'm gonna show you
how you can ask Google questions</i>

163
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,176
<i>and it'll give you answers.</i>

164
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,845
- I can make it typings?
- Yes.

165
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,349
- "Restaurants near me."
- Mm-hmm.

166
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:21,311
Maybe I look for food
that I like to eat.

167
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,563
<i>And for dessert, um...</i>

168
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:29,987
- What this?
- Ah...

169
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,156
That's not what
you're talking about, I bet.

170
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,242
This is for dessert?

171
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,577
No, this is probably
what you're looking for.

172
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:41,331
It have a pictures of a woman
with no clothes?

173
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:44,835
- Most likely.
- Wawaweewa.

174
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,795
Can I make borrowings this,
for one moment?

175
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,047
- Sure.
- I need go, uh, toilet.

176
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,551
Uh, you stay here.

Ooh.

325
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,444
Hi, I'm Macy.

326
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,446
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice meet you.

327
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,865
Come sit with me.

328
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,284
- You are sugar baby.
- I am.

329
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,035
What is sugar baby?

330
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,999
So, pretty much, a sugar baby is
a younger girl like you and I,

331
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,459
and we're dating someone
who's older.

332
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,837
- Yes.
- And how old do you like them?

333
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,297
That's the question.

334
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,049
- Nearly dead.
- Okay, then, you should

335
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,843
get someone
who just had a heart attack.

336
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,720
- Yes.
- Okay, high five.

337
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,668
- High five.
- I love that. That's what you want.

338
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,143
As a woman, you never want to be
a person who is aggressive.

339
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,897
- You want to be more submissive.
- Oh.

340
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,276
We have to be kind of weak.

341
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,652
But I'm strong.

342
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:57,322
I can open a beer
with my small hole.

343
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,866
I can't... I... Look,

344
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,702
we got to be appropriate
and ladylike.

345
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,913
Okay.

346
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,373
This is what you're not
supposed to do.

347
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,753
Okay, you did do it.

348
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:15,840
Okay, so we're not gonna do what
you just did ever on a date.

349
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:17,800
'Cause if you do that,
they won't like you.

350
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,928
You want them to like you.

351
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,055
And so that way,
you can get money from them.

352
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,515
What can I do
to make a man like me?

353
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,560
<i>You need a total makeover.
Okay?</i>

354
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:31,439
<i>From face to hair
to clothes to personality</i>

355
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,691
<i>to gestures
and to what you're doing.</i>

356
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,401
- Yes.
- Are you ready for a makeover?

357
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,111
- Yes.
- Okay.

358
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:38,780
<i>♪ I'm coming... ♪</i>

359
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:42,992
Can you come with me
to the hairdresser?

360
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:46,871
No, what if they recognize me?

361
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,665
Just disguise yourself
as an American.

362
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,208
<i>♪ Out... ♪</i>

363
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,668
I'm Melinda.

364
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,836
My name John Chevrolet.

365
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,546
Nice to meet you.

366
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,800
I want you to make a hotsie
out of this notsie.

367
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,427
- We can do it.
- You want to see the hair?

368
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:03,388
I would like
to see her hair, yes.

369
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,140
- Okay.
- No, ma'am. Not that hair.

370
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:09,727
I have a, um, idea of a hair.

371
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:10,687
Okay.

372
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,063
This one. Nice one.

373
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,190
This is actually a gentleman.

374
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,900
- This is a man?
- Yes, sir.

375
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,611

<i>♪ I want the world to know... ♪</i>

377
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,616
Okay, so we're gonna do
a spray tan today.

378
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,451
How dark is she wanting to go?

379
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,829
What color is best
for racist family?

380
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,539
I would say right here.

381
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,708
I wouldn't go any darker
than a six or a seven.

382
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:33,126
Tatti.

383
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,004
Tatti. Monkey's cock.

384
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,172
Don't.

385
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:40,383
- Delicious. That is not to eat.
- No, no, no.

386
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,026
<i>And what, uh, flavor this one?
Can I...?</i>

387
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:46,347
It's not a flavor... Awesome.

388
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:49,183
- It's not so nice.
- It's not food. I told you that.

389
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:52,520
Wawaweewa.

390
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,690
<i>♪ I want the world to know... ♪</i>

391
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:58,192
I need dress
with real sexy peels.

392
00:21:58,276 --> 00:21:59,360
Okay.

393
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:02,739
Where is the "no means yes"
section?

394
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,369
Yes?

395
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,831
Okay, we need to try this on.

396
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,298
- This is not a dress.
- What this?

397
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,966
Uh, this is a bag...

398
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,093
- Mm.
- ...That just goes over the dress.

399
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,595
Very nice.

400
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,264
- Tutar, you like the dress?
- Yes, I love it.

401
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:32,185
- The man who own this, his name Michelle?
- No.

402
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,728
This is my store.

403
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,938
My name's Michelle,
and I own this store.

404
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,608
- What?
- Yes.

405
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:43,404
Daddy, a woman can
own a business?

406
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,031
Uh...

407
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:48,576
<i>No, when a woman owns
a business her brain breaks</i>

408
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,119
<i>and her head falls off.</i>

409
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,683
Just like the previous
owners, look...

410
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,957
So young... tragic.

411
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,921
Could a woman ever
be a journalist?

412
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,131
No, it's dangerous.

413
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:04,425
Look at the manual.

414
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:08,304
This happened when a
woman tried to be a journalist.

415
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,226
What about driving a car?

416
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,852
Driving a car!?

417
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:17,688
This is what happened
when a woman drove a car.

418
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,443
Can a woman ask questions?

419
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:23,986
Questions?

420
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,281
I think it's dangerous.

421
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:28,950
Ah.

422
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,453
Time for bed.

423
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:36,290
Tomorrow you'll observe how
American girls behave in public.

424
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:40,920
<i>Howdy, folks. Welcome.</i>

425
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:45,925
Look, Daddy!

426
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,636
The fathers hold
their daughter's hands here!

427
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,930
He probably forgot
to bring a leash.

428
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,348
<i>Daddy, hold my hand</i>

429
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,892
<i>or they will know you are fake</i>

430
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,047
<i>Could a daddy
ever love a daughter</i>

431
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,716
<i>as much as he love his sons?</i>

432
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:32,096
No, any father who did that
would be sentenced to death.

433
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,181
Uh-huh.

434
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:36,642
- Howdy doody.
- Hey, how are ya?

435
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:38,853
I would like purchase a cake.

436
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:41,814
- Mm-hmm.
- Prodigious size,

437
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:44,025
made of chocolate
for my glorious leader, please.

438
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,108
Okay.

439
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,195
Can you put, um...

440
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,018
- message on it, please?
- By the... Yes, sir.

441
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,865
What would you like on this?

442
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,033
Um...

443
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,368
"Jews...

444
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:57,413
will not replace us."

445
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,665
Okay.

446
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:06,214
And maybe smiley face
underneath.

447
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,299
- Okay.
- To put him in a good mood.

448
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,470
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

449
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,550
If we could pack that
up, please. Thank you.

450
00:25:14,562 --> 00:25:15,223
Yes.

451
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:17,141
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

452
00:25:17,225 --> 00:25:18,964
- This is enough. Thank you very much.
- You sure?

453
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:20,376
- Yes, that's it.
- Okay, thank you.

454
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,813
I want to have a cake too.

455
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:24,607
<i>No. Daughters are not
allowed to have cake.</i>

456
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,817
Please! Please! Please!

457
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,778
It is illegal to give you treat.

458
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,529
<i>Teenagers.</i>

459
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:33,157
<i>Please, give it to me, Daddy!
Give it to me!</i>

460
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:34,867
<i>Give it to me!
Give it to me!</i>

461
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:37,328
Okay, choose cake, choose cake.
- <i>A new one? Okay.</i>

462
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,291
You want to pick it out?

463
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,252
<i>I will regret this.</i>

464
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,921
I want this one with the baby on it.
- Okay.

465
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:48,464
It have a lot of cream.

466
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:54,011
This is our little secret.

467
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,388
No, no, no.

468
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,557
I do not want
the authorities to see.

469
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:01,185
Ooo! I can't wait to eat this!

470
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,561
Hide back here.

471
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,022
Ready.

472
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:06,482
Okay, slow down!

473
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,858
But it's so good!

474
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:10,278
I know, but go slower, slower!

475
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:12,154
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

476
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,325
Are you ok?

477
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,577
I swallowed the baby.

478
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,621
Are you serious?

479
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:21,831
I swallowed the baby.

480
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,958
You're not supposed
to eat the baby!

481
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,713
Hurry, come with me!

482
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,673
We must get you to a doctor!

483
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,886
I have a baby inside me.
- Mm-hmm.

484
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,306
And I want to take it out of me.

485
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:39,557
Mm-hmm.

486
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:42,643
Right.

487
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:44,312
She want it out now, please.

488
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:45,896
- Right, I...
- Can you take it out?

489
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,231
No, we cannot.

490
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:49,317
- That's not what we do here.
- And why not?

491
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,569
- What you say, "take it out..."
- Yes.

492
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:52,903
You end that life.

493
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:54,864
That-that life will die.

494
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,387
<i>Well, it already dead.
It not living.</i>

495
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,242
No, it is living right now.
<i>It has a heart...</i>

496
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:00,870
- No, it this big.
- It has a heartbeat right now.

497
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,038
I don't think so.

498
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,539
It is a living,

499
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,000
breathing life
that God has created.

500
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:07,585
I don't think he's breathing.

501
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:10,504
We can show you
that it's breathing.

502
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:12,673
- It hurt my stomach.
- Mm-hmm.

503
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:15,259
And it will hurt my asshole.

504
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:17,386
Mm-hmm.
- If it come out,

505
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,056
yes, because the-the arm,

506
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,516
the arm like this.

507
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,102
- It can tear it.
- Right.

508
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:30,316
I feel bad because I was
the one who put the baby in her.

509
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,901
You don't need to feel bad.

510
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,653
I was just trying to give
my daughter pleasure,

511
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:37,156
and next thing I know,
there is a baby inside her.

512
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,491
Mm-hmm.

513
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:41,285
- You keep calling her your daughter.
- Yes.

514
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:42,787
Okay.

515
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,498
- Is he your father?
- Yes.

516
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:46,695
This is your daughter?
- Yes.

517
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,876
- Yes.
- Okay.

518
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:52,671
<i>I wanted to give
my daughter a treat...</i>

519
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,453
<i>I understand. I...
I don't need to hear any...</i>

520
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,705
<i>- And she was...</i>
- I don't need to hear any more of that.

521
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,761
<i>- I understand...
- She just had to...</i>

522
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,304
<i>...that-that she is...</i>

523
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:01,972
- But look at that face.
- I understand.

524
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:03,921
- How could I not give it to her?
- I understand.

525
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,672
- Would you have not give it to her?
- I understand.

526
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,353
Listen, uh, it really...

527
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:10,606
That is not important right now.

528
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,191
We're at this moment.

529
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:15,111
It really doesn't matter
how we got to this moment.

530
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:18,489
When he treat me, he said, "This
will be our little secret."

531
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:21,659
Yes, this is why I do it
here behind a dumpster,

532
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:24,495
so no... no one can see.

533
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:27,331
Now that you know
that I am her father,

534
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:29,375
can we take it out now, please?

535
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:31,836
God is the one who creates life.

536
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,422
And God doesn't make accidents.

537
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:40,261
Push!
Oh, it hurt!

538
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,471
Hurt!
- Push out the baby!

539
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:47,643
- Push it out.
- Ooh, it hurt!

540
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,978
Push...

541
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,509
The baby, it out.

542
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:51,814
Okay, flush it down.

543
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,483
But the Jesus people said
we have to keep it.

544
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,444
<i>It disgusting.
It smell retched.</i>

545
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:58,112
Flush the baby away!

546
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,280
I'm keeping it.

547
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,157
Okay, okay.

548
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:05,703
- Ah, she want to keep the baby.
- Mm.

549
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:07,663
You know what it's like.

550
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,876
<i>Tutar...</i>

551
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:15,838
<i>Your makeover is complete...</i>
I think you are ready for Pence.

552
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,007
Really?
- Mm.

553
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,093
But to be sure, let's have
a practice run tonight.

554
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:22,887
<i>Cinderella...</i>

555
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,847
<i>it's time...</i>

556
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,682
<i>to go to a ball.</i>

557
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,401
<i>Before the ball,</i>

558
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:40,488
<i>I would meet with fancy lady
who would help me</i>

559
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:43,407
<i>introduce my daughter
to high societies.</i>

560
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:45,534
<i>Hi.
How are you today?</i>

561
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:47,620
Good. Uh, Cliff.
Cliff Safari.

562
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,914
And my name is Dr. Jeanie.

563
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:52,124
So nice to meet you today.

564
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:54,835
<i>My daughter, Miss Ellie,
I need to get her</i>

565
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:57,713
<i>ready for ball.</i>

566
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,798
<i>So the thing about it is</i>

567
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:03,052
<i>we want to get
your daughter all prepared</i>

568
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:06,722
<i>by showing her
the right kinds of things to do.</i>

569
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:07,932
Hell yeah!

570
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:26,116
<i>Now let us present
the debutantes.</i>

571
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,495
<i>Miss Mamie Henderson,
daughter of Mr. Bill Henderson</i>

572
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:31,163
<i>and Laura Schofield.</i>

573
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,791
She is presented by her father.

574
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:35,834
Daddy, you need to hold my arm,

575
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:38,712
so they think we're American.

576
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:41,215
Okay... just this once.

577
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:44,510
<i>Sandra Jessica Parker Drummond</i>

578
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:49,640
<i>and her father,
Professor Phillip Drummond III.</i>

579
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:52,643
<i>Miss Drummond is attending
Grand Canyon University</i>

580
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:55,145
<i>where she is double majoring

<i>and electronics
with a focus on VCR repair.</i>

582
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:03,571
When I at the ball,
is it sufficient

583
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:07,449
to make little braggings
about little missy?

584
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,243
Maybe, yes.

585
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:10,536
And you know what?

586
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:15,082
<i>You have to do it
very, let's say...</i>

587
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,584
<i>graciously.</i>

588
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,711
- That's your daughter?
- Yeah.

589
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:22,214
- That's what we love in the South.
- Yeah.

590
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,216
- Pretty girls.
- Yeah.

591
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,720
<i>Okay. It's-it's...
They're fun.</i>

592
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:31,890
How much you think
my daughter is worth?

593
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:33,976
Five hundred dollars.

594
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,519
Ooh, thank you.

595
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:38,981
<i>You my best friend, buddy.</i>

596
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:44,069
- It's all a...
- That's fucking gross.

597
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:47,364
My daughter have
her moon blood arrive.

598
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:50,242
Can she still go to a ball?

599
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:51,744
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- Ah, good, so she...</i>

600
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,622
<i>We're able to do
a lot of things even though</i>

601
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:58,917
<i>we have womanly things
that we go through every...</i>

602
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:01,211
<i>moon time you're talking about.</i>

603
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:15,517
<i>We'd now like to invite
Sandra Jessica Parker Drummond</i>

604
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:20,564
<i>and her father,

605
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:22,441
<i>for our traditional
father/daughter dance.</i>

606
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,277
It's my moon blood.

607
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:26,820
It started?

608
00:32:26,904 --> 00:32:29,156
Yes.

609
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,241
Fantastic!

610
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:33,202
<i>Now we can wow them...</i>

611
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:36,622
<i>with our traditional
fertility dance!</i>

612
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:43,754
Um, <i>can you play...</i>

613
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:53,907
<i>♪ Hey! Hey! Hey! ♪</i>

614
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:55,909
<i>♪ Hey! ♪</i>

615
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:07,337
I will never get to live in a
golden cage like Melania!

616
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:13,218
Why do American men hate me?

617
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:40,996
Come in.

618
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:44,208
Really?

619
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:45,834
Do you mean it, Daddy?

620
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:54,468
<i>Thank you so much, Daddy.
Okay.</i>

621
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:31,755
Tutar!

622
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:35,050
I've got great news!

623
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:38,136
Pence is speaking nearby.

624
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,888
We'll gift you today.

625
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:42,975
- But I am not ready yet.
- Of course you're ready!

626
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,018
You are ready
for the golden cage!

627
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,187
Okay, Daddy!

628
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:57,281
<i>Finally the time had come
to deliver my daughter</i>

629
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:59,324
<i>to the vice pussy-grabber.</i>

630
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:01,118
<i>But how would I slip in</i>

631
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:04,705
<i>to this conference
of Republicans unnoticed?</i>

632
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,374
Suddenly, I had an idea.

633
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,589
<i>I'm Stephen Miller.
Sorry I'm late.</i>

634
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:29,021
I needed to get Tutar to Pence,

635
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,857
the only man
that Trump would trust.

636
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:35,360
But who does Pence trust?

637
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:38,363
I knew the disguise
I had to use.

638
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,332
Tutar, it's me.

639
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,667
- Huh? Oh.
- Hop on! We are running late.

640
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:55,589
<i>I know you're ready
to demonstrate how much</i>

641
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:59,051
<i>you appreciate everything
he does for our country.</i>

642
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,720
<i>And it's my honor
to introduce to you</i>

643
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,209
<i>the vice president
of the United States,</i>

644
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,641
<i>Michael R. Pence.</i>

645
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,703
<i>As of today,</i>

646
00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:28,372
<i>we have 15 cases of coronavirus</i>

647
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,707
<i>that have been detected
in the United States</i>

648
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:34,711
<i>with only one new case detected
in the last two weeks.</i>

649
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:38,715
<i>And while the risk
to the American public</i>

650
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:43,512
<i>remains low, as the president
said yesterday,</i>

651
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:46,723
"We're ready.
We're ready for anything."

652
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,147
<i>It's actually on the verge...</i>
- Michael Pen-is!

653
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:56,566
Michael Pen-is!
I brought a girl for you!

654
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,403
Don't worry,
I won't get jealous!

655
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:00,821
She not Ivanka.

656
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,197
Get out!

657
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,242
Pussy Hound Pen-is!

658
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,077
<i>You just hit me, man.
You just hit me.</i>

659
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,912
Don't punch me.

660
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:10,497
Mike, help me!

661
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,959
Mike, you're fired!

662
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,460
<i>Four more years!</i>

663
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:18,171
<i>Four more years!
Four more years!</i>

664
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:19,548
<i>Four more years!</i>

665
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,341
<i>Four more years!</i>

666
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:23,427
<i>A hundred more years!</i>
- <i>Four more years!</i>

667
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,637
If you release me,
I'll give you my Klan robes.

668
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:27,597
- Don't stop. Keep moving.
- How about my wig?

669
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:29,307
<i>Don't stop.
Keep moving.</i>

670
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:34,062
<i>The United States Senate
cleared our president on all...</i>

671
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:42,279
Please make faxy-meal of this.

672
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:46,324
"Premier Nazarbayev,
I have unfortunate news.

673

Yours, Borat."

675
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:56,543
- And then put sad face.
- "Sad face."

676
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:59,087
Okay.

677
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:05,761
"Return immediately

682
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,996
What's the matter, Daddy?

683
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,706
Nothing.

684
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,667
Will they hurt you?

685
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,463
Of course not.

686
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:46,301
Could I be a gift
to this friend of Trump instead?

687
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,720
No, he's in jail.

688
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:49,679
What about this one?

689
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:51,765
In jail too.

690
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:52,848
Him?

691
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:54,434
Arrested.

Him?

House arrest.

694
00:39:57,312 --> 00:40:01,358
What about Rudolph Giuliani?

695
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:16,790
What he say?

696
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:19,126
"If you can deliver her to Rudy,

00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:45,193
<i>from the top to the bottom,
from the middle to the side!</i>

703
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:48,697
<i>Rudolph was McDonald's
best buddy in whole world,</i>

704
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,743
<i>and also very dignified
statesman of the highest order.</i>

705
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:55,483
You don't know what
you're talking about, idiot.

706
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,914
- Shut up, moron. Shut up.
- Rudy. Rudy. Okay.

707
00:40:57,998 --> 00:40:59,958
<i>This would not be easy.</i>

708
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:03,211
<i>Luckily, I discover
his preference for womens</i>

709
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:06,882
<i>with ample
cheese-producing capacity.</i>

710
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:10,093
I take my daughter
to man who can help.

711
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:14,389
After me.

712
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:17,559
<i>I want very much</i>

713
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:21,855
<i>her to be attract to...
top-level guy.</i>

714
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:25,859
Well, what I would suggest is
that we do some simple things.

715
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:29,613
Like a little r-refinement
of the nose.

716
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:31,990
What's wrong with my nose?

717
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,950
Do I look like a Jew?

718
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:35,827
No, ma'am.
Not at all.

719
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:39,956
- Oh, that...
<i>- Because a Jew...</i>

720
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,958
- Yeah, she was, uh, very sad.
<i>- A Jew...</i>

721
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,668
A Jew would be like this.

722
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:45,879
Jew nose more out,

723
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:49,633
out a bit more, down here,

724
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,551
then down a bit here,

725
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:53,553
bump, bump, in.

726
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:55,513
It can be that bad, yes.

727
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:57,057
- Mm.
<i>- Then, if you like,</i>

728
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,184
<i>what I would suggest</i>

729
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,436
<i>is that maybe we put
some breast implants.</i>

730
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,599
And what it mean, "breast"?

731
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:04,522
- The-the breast. Titty.
- Mm.

732
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:05,523
Titty?

733
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:06,942
- Titty.
- Titty?

734
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:07,943
Titty.

735
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,110
- Titty?
- Titty.

736
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:11,613
- Titty.
- Or breast.

737
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:14,991
I want a man who wants
to make a sex attack on me.

738
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:17,202
Mm-hmm.

739
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:19,496
I think that would be most men.

740
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,831
Would you make a sex attack
with me?

741
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,126
Uh...

742
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,045
if your father was not here.

743
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:30,757
Ooh.
Ah!

744
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:34,469
Hello.
Hello.

745
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:39,015
So, altogether,
the total is $21,751.

746
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:41,309
How much?

747
00:42:41,393 --> 00:42:44,229
$21,751.

748
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:47,107
- Tenge or dollar?
- Dollars.

749
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:49,734
Okay.

750
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:53,321
- With the, uh, saline implant...
- Yes?

751
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:57,575
Um, could you take off
some money if instead, uh,

752
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:59,703
you use potatoes?

753
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,997
- Uh, we cannot use potatoes.
- Why not?

754
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,374
Because potatoes aren't sterile.

755
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,917
This a very good potato.

756
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,877
<i>But you cannot take a potato</i>

757
00:43:07,961 --> 00:43:10,088
<i>- and put it in the body.</i>
- Expensive one.

758
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:13,550
What if we allow, uh, perverts
in to watch the surgery?

759
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,051
Can we have reduction?

760
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:17,512
You can keep the money
that they pay you.

761
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,097
Uh, absolutely not.

762
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,808
The more people you bring in,
the more germs come in.

763
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:23,476
You cannot do that.

764
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,688
The perverts have to be
medical personnel.

765
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,441
They have to be
either a doctor or a nurse.

766
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,484
<i>I want to make sure that, uh,</i>

767
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:33,987
<i>the man I give her to
is very happy</i>

768
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,032
<i>- and will not return her.</i>
- Okay.

769
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,451
So the quality
must be tip-top. Will it be?

770
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:40,660
It will be tip-top.

771
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:42,454
It'll be more than tip-top.

772
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:45,457
- Are you able to pay this amount? Yes?
- Yes, I have.

773
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,126
Okay. Thank you.

774
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,128
<i>One, two,</i>

775
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,756
<i>three, four, five, six, seven...</i>

776
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,132
Ooh.

777
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,676
That's a lot of money,
but worth it.

778
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,929
<i>So after you give me
as a gift...</i>

779
00:44:00,013 --> 00:44:02,557
<i>...you will leave me?</i>

780
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,892
Of course.

781
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:07,645
I will go home and you
will have new owner.

782
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:11,608
So I will never see you again?

783
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:16,613
You expected me to come
live with you both?

784
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:20,700
No... of course not.

785
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:23,453
Hmm.

786
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:26,748
The manual would forbid it.

787
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,471
You have,
uh, sufficient?

788
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:44,432
Uh, no, I'm short $72.

789
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:46,226
And if we do not get to this,

790
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:49,479
- you cannot make the surgery anyway?
- Right.

791
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,981
And the surgery
will start at 6:00 p.m.

792
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:55,860
I only have 24 hours
to get you $72?

793
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:57,612
Well, yes.

794
00:44:58,655 --> 00:45:00,657
We better get to work.

795
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,993
To pay for new chests,
I would need employment.

796
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:05,787
So, next day,

797
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,289
<i>I leave my daughter with babysitter.</i>

798
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:09,833
Hello.

799
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,293
Uh, what your name?

800
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:14,504
- Jeanise.
- Jeanise. Nice meet you.

801
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,423
Nice meeting you.

802
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,266
So what is that, like, a treat?

803
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,560
Treat, uh, yeah.

804
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:32,730
Uh, when she perform
a command correctly,

805
00:45:32,814 --> 00:45:34,983
click, you give her a treat.

806
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:38,653
Um... Oh. Okay.

807
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,572
This is her ball.

808
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:43,283
Um, it make her feel safe.

809
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:48,246
Uh, for water, uh,
please use this.

810
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:51,207
Uh, we drink water
out of a glass.

811
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:52,750
<i>Uh, the strings in her brain</i>

812
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:55,211
<i>might break
if you try to teach her,</i>

813
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:56,921
<i>so be careful, please.</i>

814
00:45:57,005 --> 00:45:59,382
You said it's her strings
in her brain might break?

815
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:01,718
They can be strain
and sometimes pop.

816
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,845
<i>One of them already...</i>

817
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:06,890
<i>she saw something and, uh,
it was complicate for her,</i>

818
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:09,726
<i>and I hear the noise.</i>
"Ding."

819
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:12,395
Oh, my God. Really.

820
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,605
See you later.

821
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,482
Don't leave me here.

822
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:17,650
See you later
at the titty doctor.

823
00:46:19,152 --> 00:46:20,904
All right.

824
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:23,823
<i>The mutilations
would commence in five hours.</i>

825
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:27,535
Luckily, I get hired for job.

826
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:29,370
<i>What would you like?</i>
I can, um...

827
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:30,663
take it all off?

828
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:32,499
Keep it where it's, you know...

829
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:34,125
Above the ears is fine.

830
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:40,256
- Want me shave your arms?
- No.

831
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,022
No?

832
00:46:41,034 --> 00:46:43,092
<i>No. You're not gonna
shave my hair off, are you?</i>

833
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:44,969
- No, no, no.
- Okay.

834
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:48,640
<i>Uh, I am good, though.
I have done, um...</i>

835
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:52,852
But you do
mostly animals, though, right?

836
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:54,521
Uh, no.

837
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:58,358
Uh, this, uh, Billy Sexcrime
before they remove his chram.

838
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:00,485
<i>I remove his pubis.
I was given honor.</i>

839
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:02,195
Oh, that's great.

840
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:07,367
To your satisfaction, sir?

841
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:12,163
That's fine.

842
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:16,668
That's fine.

843
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,300
That's fine.

844
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:27,178
What's in the book?

845
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:29,138
This is our book.

846
00:47:29,222 --> 00:47:30,974
Can I read you a story?

847
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:33,518
- You can't read.
- I can read.

848
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:35,728
- Are you a man?
- No, I'm not a man.

849
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:37,355
Show me your putka.

850
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:40,984
<i>I'm not showing you anything.
But I'm a woman.</i>

851
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:47,699
This... is my favorite.

852
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,243
"The true story of Nada..."

853
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:52,870
- Nadia Akatov.
- Okay.

854
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:55,373
"...who once caught
a terrible disease"

855
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:57,417
"called curiosity."

856
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:03,339
"It cause her one night to

857
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:06,718
touch her... vagine?"

858
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,596
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

859
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:13,099
"Her vagine became very angry...

860
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:16,603
...and bit her hand."

861
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:18,730
- You okay?
- Yes.

862
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:20,231
- It's just a story?
- Yes.

863
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:22,275
- You want me to...
- But it's a true story.

864
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:24,527
- It's a true story?
- Yes.

865
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:28,740
"Then suck all of her insides..."

866
00:48:30,283 --> 00:48:33,202
"...where she remains
to this day."

867
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:34,579
Yes.

868
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:36,831
This is not a true story.

869
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,250
- Okay?
- It is a true story.

870
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:40,918
No, no, it's not a true story.

871
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:43,630
Your vagine cannot bite.

872
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:46,883
It cannot suck your arms
to a ball.

873
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,343
It can't do that.

874
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:50,136
But my tatti told me that.

875
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,180
- Okay.
- He tell me the truth.

876
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:54,474
I mean, I understand
what you're saying,

877
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:57,226
- that your daddy told you that.
- Yes.

878
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,853
But that's not the real world.

879
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,606
- Are you touch your vagine?
- Who, me?

880
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,691
- Yes.
- Have I ever touched it?

881
00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:05,151
- Yes.
- Yes.

882
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:07,153
- No.
- Yes.

883
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,697
- You can't touch your...
- And I... Yes, and I'm here.

884
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:12,700
Didn't n-nothing ate me up.

885
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:14,285
See, I'm here.

886
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:15,870
You ready?

887
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:18,539
What are you doing?

888
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,041
We're driving.

889
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,292
Women can drive.

890
00:49:21,376 --> 00:49:23,127
Don't cry.

891
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:25,129
Don't cry.
Don't cry.

892
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:26,631
- It's okay.
- You can't drive!

893
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:27,965
You can't drive!

894
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:29,288
- I can drive. I can.
- You can't drive!

895
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,831
- It's impossible woman to drive!
- No, no.

896
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:32,220
<i>- This is...</i>
- No, no, no!

897
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:34,555
- You are a man dressed like a woman.
- No. No.

898
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,140
Help me!

899
00:49:36,224 --> 00:49:38,476
It's a woman driving the car!

900
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:42,313
May I?

901
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:47,527
Thank you.

902
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:53,032
<i>Great success!
I had the money.</i>

903
00:49:53,116 --> 00:49:58,329
<i>It was time for the surgeon
to insert Tutar's potatoes.</i>

904
00:50:01,124 --> 00:50:03,167
Did you have a good time?

905
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:06,129
- Yes.
- I'm glad.

906
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:08,214
What you finna do?

907
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,091
<i>I will get the surgery
so my daddy</i>

908
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:14,846
<i>can give me as a present
for this American man.</i>

909
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:16,723
What kind of surgery?

910
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:21,060
I will have the biggest titties
in the whole world.

911
00:50:21,144 --> 00:50:24,689
Okay, so you're getting
plastic surgery at 15.

912
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:26,274
Yes.

913
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:28,651
- When you getting that done?
- Now.

914
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,778
- Now?
- Yes.

915
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:33,865
Well, do you want that?

916
00:50:35,158 --> 00:50:36,743
Seriously.

917
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:40,747
No, you don't,
'cause you would've said yes.

918
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:41,998
I excite.

919
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:44,417
You excite, but that's not
what you want.

920
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,170
Okay, I don't think
you need to do that.

921
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:50,089
'Cause you're pretty
and you're young.

922
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:55,011
And any man should
like you as you are.

923
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:59,015
You shouldn't want to be
anybody else but yourself.

924
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:01,601
But if I have enormous titties,

925
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:04,312
I don't have to learn
how to swim.

926
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:07,148
Your-your titties will not
keep you from drowning.

927
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,776
You will still have to
learn how to swim.

928
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:11,694
They will protect me.

929
00:51:11,778 --> 00:51:15,114
<i>How will they protect you?
They titties.</i>

930
00:51:15,198 --> 00:51:18,242
Titties are not gonna
keep you out the water.

931
00:51:18,326 --> 00:51:22,038
<i>You are pretty.
You're a pretty...</i>

932
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:23,581
Girl, look at yourself.

933
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:25,625
Look. Look.

934
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:28,711
You see yourself?

935
00:51:28,795 --> 00:51:30,546
Huh?

936
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:34,300
Yes, you are beautiful.

937
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:37,512
<i>So I don't see anything
on your body or on your face</i>

938
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:38,971
<i>that need to change.</i>

939
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:40,973
I want you to be happy.

940
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:42,934
<i>But I wish you would
just think about</i>

941
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,560
<i>some of the stuff I said.</i>

942
00:51:44,644 --> 00:51:46,521
Think about going to school.

943
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:50,358
Use your brain, 'cause
your daddy is a liar, okay?

944
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:54,070
My daddy's the smartest person
in the whole flat world.

945
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:59,450
Mm, I can't, I can't say
nothing about that,

946
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:03,704
but you got a big brain
up there, so use it.

947
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:04,914
Just think.

948
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:07,250
'Cause I don't think
you need to change.

949
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,418
I will think about it.

950
00:52:09,502 --> 00:52:11,142
<i>Hey, that's all I want.
That's all I want.</i>

951
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,630
I want you to think about it.

952
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:15,341
That's all I want for you,
just to think about it.

953
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:40,700
Another woman.

954
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:59,665
- Adam Schiff.
- Oh, my God. He's so...

955
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,012
What a loser.

956
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:06,934
So what's your name?

957
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:08,060
I'm Tutar.

958
00:53:08,144 --> 00:53:09,020
- Really?
- Nice to meet you, Tutar.

959
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:10,479
Nice meet you.

960
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:11,856
Do you drive a car?

961
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:12,940
- Yes.
- Oh, absolutely.

962
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:14,442
- Sure.
- More than one.

963
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,015
- More than one.
- Well, not at the same time.

964
00:53:16,027 --> 00:53:18,821
- What?!
- We drive a car. We own cars.

965
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:22,825
So the mans sometimes tell lies?

966
00:53:22,909 --> 00:53:25,536
Yes. A-A lot.

967
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:27,246
Hmm.

968
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:15,461
<i>We-We've seen a dramatic drop</i>

969
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:18,047
<i>in having children
produced within wedlock.</i>

970
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:21,550
It's a huge problem
in our society.

971
00:54:21,634 --> 00:54:24,095
<i>And I think part of that is
the decline of Christianity</i>

972
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:25,888
<i>in-in the United States.</i>

973
00:54:25,972 --> 00:54:27,431
- Can I say something?
- Uh...

974
00:54:27,515 --> 00:54:28,641
- Yes.
- I want... Yes.

975
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:30,601
<i>I want you to speak now.</i>

976
00:54:30,685 --> 00:54:33,354
I'd love for you to speak now.

977
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,439
- This important.
- Yes.

978
00:54:35,523 --> 00:54:37,650
Yeah, great.
Yes.

979
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:39,986
Something really strange,
something wonderful

980
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:41,737
just happened to me.

981
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:44,281
<i>And...</i>

982
00:54:45,574 --> 00:54:50,746
<i>I go to the toilet,
and I put my index finger...</i>

983
00:54:52,123 --> 00:54:55,501
<i>...and my-my middle finger
on my cunt.</i>

984
00:54:55,584 --> 00:55:00,381
<i>And I found out
that I wasn't sucked in</i>

985
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:03,259
<i>and I wasn't eaten.</i>

986
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:06,053
Womans, this place is amazing.

987
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:08,389
No teeth at all.
- It has no what?

988
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:09,473
No teeth.

989
00:55:09,557 --> 00:55:10,725
- Oh.
- No teeth.

990
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:12,893
It's so nice,
so warm.

991
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:14,603
I will show you.

992
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,481
You move this way,
circle four time.

993
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:20,943
Then you move up and down,
and if it's not working,

994
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:23,654
you can use
this part of your hand.

995
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:28,242
And then you will feel
something like an explosion,

996
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,577
and then you will finish.

997
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,370
Come on.

998
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:33,748
Take your panties off,
everyone, please.

999
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,916
Do you touch your vagine?

1000
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,463
Uh, it's something
we don't talk about in p-public.

1001
00:55:40,546 --> 00:55:42,214
Because of
the Nadia Akatov story?

1002
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:45,009
No, no, no, no.

1003
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:48,637
If that is a lie, what other
lies my daddy tell me?

1004
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:51,265
So come with me.

1005
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:54,185
<i>Come with me.
Let's run away from our daddies.</i>

1006
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,812
<i>Let's go and put
our hands together</i>

1007
00:55:56,896 --> 00:55:58,814
<i>and touch our vagines.</i>

1008
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:02,443
<i>And we're so glad you're here.
Thank you.</i>

1009
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,282
Someone call her an Uber.

1010
00:56:29,929 --> 00:56:31,430
Tutar!

1011
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:36,143
Tutar. Tutar.

1012
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:39,980
You went to the wrong address!

1013
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:41,899
It's over there.

1014
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:43,359
- I did not.
- Come on.

1015
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:44,902
It's titty time.

1016
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:47,029
- No, I'm not doing it.
- Why not?

1017
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:49,657
<i>Because I'm beautiful as I am,</i>

1018
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,784
<i>and I don't need to be given
as a gift to a man</i>

1019
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:52,952
<i>to be worth something.</i>

1020
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:54,787
<i>Yes, you do.
It says so in the book.</i>

1021
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,331
The Nadia Akatov story is a lie.

1022
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,083
- Not a lie. It true.
- It is a lie.

1023
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:01,585
- I did it.
- What?

1024
00:57:01,669 --> 00:57:04,296
<i>How did you escape?
Out of your asshole?</i>

1025
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:07,675
<i>No. And the rest of the book
is also a lie.</i>

1026
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:10,886
<i>Look there.
It's a woman driving a car.</i>

1027
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:13,722
<i>That is not a woman.
That is Dog the Bounty Hunter.</i>

1028
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:18,310
This manual is full of lies.

1029
00:57:18,394 --> 00:57:21,480
I found a new book
which only tells the truth.

1030
00:57:21,564 --> 00:57:24,316
It's called Facebook.

1031
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,735
I learn so many facts there.

1032
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:29,446
Like our nation's
proudest moment,

1033
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,991
the Holocaust, never happened.

1034
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:34,118
- How dare you say that?
- Look.

1035
00:57:37,288 --> 00:57:38,747
: No.

1036
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:41,167
See?

1037
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,753
- I'm leaving.
- No, you don't.

1038
00:57:44,837 --> 00:57:46,839
Wh-Who will lock
your cage at night?

1039
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:48,591
I can do anything a man can do.

1040
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:50,968
- No, you cannot.
- I can even become a journalist,

1041
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:52,928
and probably
a better one than you,

1042
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:54,305
Borat Margaret Sagdiyev!

1043
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:56,098
Who told you
my middle name was Margaret?!

1044
00:57:56,182 --> 00:57:57,474
Everyone you know!

1045
00:57:57,558 --> 00:57:59,685
You will never understand
anything!

1046
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:01,061
I understand everything!

1047
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:02,855
You want this book?

1048
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:05,524
- Hey!
- Take it. I hate it.

1049
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:06,609
And I hate you.

1050
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:08,652
And I will never see you again.

1051
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:11,447
Oh, and by the way,
I ate the monkey.

1052
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,656
He didn't eat himself.

1053
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,200
You murderer!

1054
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:15,951
He was a genius!

1055
00:58:16,035 --> 00:58:17,203
Go.

1056
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:21,707
<i>Come out now.
One, two... No, you don't.</i>

1057
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,584
No!

1058
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:32,343
Tutar!

1059
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:43,729
<i>My mission had fail, and I had
learned that the Holocaust</i>

1060
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:45,856
<i>was nothing but a fairy tale.</i>

1061
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:49,777
Rather than return
to Kazakhstan to be execute,

1062
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,779
I decide to take my own life.

1063
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:55,157
<i>Since I did not have money
to buy a gun,</i>

1064
00:58:55,241 --> 00:58:57,910
<i>I went to the nearest synagogue</i>

1065
00:58:57,993 --> 00:59:00,579
<i>to wait for
the next mass shooting,</i>

1066
00:59:00,663 --> 00:59:03,249
<i>disguised as a typical Jew.</i>

1067
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:17,554
Hello.
- Uh, Jang-shalom.

1068
00:59:17,638 --> 00:59:19,473
Are you Jew?

1069
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,225
Yeah, I'm Jewish, yeah.

1070
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:24,687
Very nice weather, uh,
we have been controlling.

1071
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,105
You are Jewish?

1072
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:29,233
Um... y-yes.

1073
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,235
No, you are not Jewish.

1074
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,322
Listen, don't-don't be
afraid of me.

1075
00:59:35,406 --> 00:59:37,574
But please don't eat me alive.

1076
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:40,077
Uh, do I look like I eat people?

1077
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,830
- Uh...
- I'm a old, good woman.

1078
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:44,206
Yes.

1079
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:46,292
- Look at me. I'm Jewish.
- Yeah.

1080
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:47,960
Do I have a long nose?

1081
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:50,254
- Look at me.
- No.

1082
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:51,964
You can touch my nose.

1083
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:54,091
- What?
- Look at me.

1084
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:56,677
You see? Is it long?

1085
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,721
- No, it's a small one.
- Exactly like yours.

1086
00:59:58,804 --> 00:59:59,888
Look at Doris.

1087
00:59:59,972 --> 01:00:01,807
Does she have a long nose?

1088
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:05,185
A little bit bigger
than yours.

1089
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:07,688
So we are normal,
exactly like you.

1090
01:00:07,771 --> 01:00:10,691
Okay, then, use your venom
on me and finish me.

1091
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:13,444
I have... I am very depress.

1092
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,279
Can I give you a hug?

1093
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,073
- Don't-don't.
- Don't kill me.

1094
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:19,867
I will not kill you.

1095
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,869
Let me give you a kiss.

1096
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:27,249
<i>You see? I give you a kiss,
and you are still alive.</i>

1097
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:30,210
For now I am, but maybe
the venom take longer.

1098
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:33,005
<i>Oh, come on.
You will be okay.</i>

1099
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:35,007
I'm hungry.

1100
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:36,842
- You are hungry?
- Yes.

1101
01:00:38,052 --> 01:00:39,845
- Good, huh?
- Very good.

1102
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:42,431
- Very good, huh?
- Mmm.

1103
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,851
I want to hear your story,
my dear.

1104
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:47,895
<i>This is the worst story</i>

1105
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:51,315
<i>that ever happened
to any human being...</i>

1106
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:53,150
<i>or Jew.</i>

1107
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:58,489
<i>I came here on a simple mission
to save my country by delivering</i>

1108
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:01,450
<i>our number one televiski star
Johnny the Monkey</i>

1109
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:04,161
<i>as a gift to Michael Pence.</i>

1110
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:06,622
And I'm sure you've figured out
what happen next.

1111
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:11,377
My daughter had smuggled herself
into the crate,

1112
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:15,464
and yes, you got it,
she'd eaten the monkey.

1113
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:18,384
Although I believe
he probably eat himself.

1114
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:20,594
There are bad stories out there.

1115
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,763
Listen, you want
to hear my story,

1116
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,753
- when I was a little child?
- Yes, what is your story?

1117
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:27,184
<i>I was in the Holocaust.
You see me?</i>

1118
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:28,936
I was in the Holocaust.

1119
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,634
- The Holocaust? You were in the...
- Yeah.

1120
01:01:30,646 --> 01:01:31,360
I was...

1121
01:01:31,372 --> 01:01:33,524
<i>But the Hol... The
Holocaust never happen.</i>

1122
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:36,193
But I saw it with my own eyes.

1123
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:39,071
So the Holocaust...

1124
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:40,697
- Happened.
- ...happen?

1125
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:42,699
- Yes.
- Really?

1126
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,077
- Really.
- It was not a fake?

1127
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,578
No. No, my dear.

1128
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:48,747
It wa... it really happened.

1129
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:51,333
<i>Thank you, Judith.
You made me so happy.</i>

1130
01:01:51,417 --> 01:01:53,043
Thank you.

1131
01:01:53,127 --> 01:01:55,295
<i>Thank you for giving me...</i>

1132
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:57,339
- Hope.
<i>- ...faith and hope again.</i>

1133
01:01:57,423 --> 01:02:00,467
Let's make I-love
instead of war.

1134
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:03,387
<i>Hold on.
One step at a time, Judith.</i>

1135
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:06,056
The Holocaust happen!

1136
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:08,350
My culture was right!

1137
01:02:08,434 --> 01:02:10,894
<i>I had to find
my daughter immediate</i>

1138
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:13,564
<i>and deliver her to Giuliani.</i>

1139
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:16,233
I search in nearby village.

1140
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:17,484
Tutar!

1141
01:02:17,568 --> 01:02:19,736
But for some reason,

1142
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:23,031
- the streets were completely empty.
- Tutar!

1143
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:24,575
Tutar!

1144
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:27,077
Stop hiding!

1145
01:02:31,457 --> 01:02:33,876
Uh, hello. Jangshemash.

1146
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:35,794
Where is everybody?

1147
01:02:35,878 --> 01:02:38,172
I do not see anybody
on the street.

1148
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,923
That's... Everybody's at home.

1149
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:41,383
<i>They're telling them
to stay inside</i>

1150
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:43,177
<i>so they don't spread this virus.</i>

1151
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,179
- Wh... There is a virus?
- Yes.

1152
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:48,182
They're wanting everybody
to quarantine.

1153
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:50,392
I do not have, uh,
nowhere else to go.

1154
01:02:50,476 --> 01:02:52,686
Could I stay your home?

1155
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,324
This is it.

1156
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:07,534
Come on in.

1157
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:12,456
- You go ahead and come on in.
- Oh. Oh.

1158
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:15,375
<i>Very nice. Yes?
Well, hello.</i>

1159
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:17,252
- Yes.
- Yes.

1160
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:19,046
Nice to meet you.

1161
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:21,798
- Okay.
- Yes.

1162
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:24,301
How long must we be stuck
in here?

1163
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:26,053
Well, don't know for sure.

1164
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:29,181
Till this COVID-19 thing passes.

1165
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:34,228
What is more dangerous, this,
uh, virus or the Democrat?

1166
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:37,064
<i>Democrats.</i>
Uh-huh.

1167
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:38,774
<i>I think, with the Democrats,</i>

1168
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:43,111
<i>with Obama... and I think
it goes back to the Clintons...</i>

1169
01:03:43,195 --> 01:03:45,364
When they were also in office.

1170
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:48,283
This, uh, Clinton,
they make this plague?

1171
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:50,911
Yes. Yes.
Mm. Not nice!

1172
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:53,247
- Clintons are very evil.
- Extremely evil.

1173
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:55,874
Supposedly,
they torture these kids.

1174
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:58,267
It gets their adrenaline
flowing in their body.

1175
01:03:58,279 --> 01:03:59,044
Mm-hmm.

1176
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:01,171
<i>Then they take that
out of their adren...</i>

1177
01:04:01,255 --> 01:04:02,464
<i>- Adrenal glands...</i>
- Yeah.

1178
01:04:02,548 --> 01:04:03,868
<i>...and then they drink
their blood</i>

1179
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:05,300
<i>or that-that out of their...</i>

1180
01:04:05,384 --> 01:04:07,384
<i>I've heard about things like that.</i>
Yeah.

1181
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:09,846
Hillary Clinton drink
the, uh, blood of children?

1182
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,515
- That's what we've heard.
- Yeah.

1183
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:14,017
- I've heard.
- It's-it's been said.

1184

Yeah.

01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:43,273
<i>Jim and Jerry found ways
to cheer me up.</i>

1218
01:05:43,357 --> 01:05:44,512
<i>I wrote a song
for you last night</i>

1219
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:46,234
<i>so you can play for us.</i>

1220
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:49,029
It's called
"The Chinese Virus Song."

1221
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:52,240
<i>♪ Obama was a traitor... ♪</i>

1222
01:05:52,324 --> 01:05:54,493
"America, he did hate her."
- Yeah.

1223
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:57,120
<i>♪ America, he hate her ♪</i>

1224
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:58,485
- There you go.
- Yeah, that's good.

1225
01:05:58,497 --> 01:05:59,665
<i>That's good.
I like that.</i>

1226
01:05:59,748 --> 01:06:01,875
- That's good.
- Say, "You can put him in jail."

1227
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,378
<i>♪ You must put him in jail. ♪</i>

1228
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:06,672
Yep.
Is he in jail?

1229
01:06:06,755 --> 01:06:08,799
No, but I hope so soon.

1230
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:11,760
But I still
had not found Tutar.

1231
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:14,721
And although my buddies
were highly knowledgeables,

1232
01:06:14,805 --> 01:06:18,308
they didn't know anything
about womens.

1233
01:06:18,392 --> 01:06:19,643
The women here have rights.

1234
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,269
They can do whatever they want.

1235
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:26,066
They have a brain
like we have a brain.

1236
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:29,861
They can think and say the
same things we think and say.

1237
01:06:29,945 --> 01:06:31,780
<i>When girl born,
you are given</i>

1238
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:33,782

1239
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:36,785

01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:39,663
The male baby come out walking.

1241
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:42,791
<i>Not the female.
The male baby come out...</i>

1242
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:44,918
- Look, you see.
- Uh, they don't.

1243
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,712
This is supposed to be
the doctors,

1244
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:48,338
with delivery of the baby?

1245
01:06:48,422 --> 01:06:49,715
Yes.

1246
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:52,676
The doctor wait
for the baby to fall out,

1247
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:55,220
and you have
two other doctor do this.

1248
01:06:55,303 --> 01:06:58,056
- Well, you don't need that. No.
- One in anoos, one in mouth.

1249
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:01,435
What you have shown us
and explained to us,

1250
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:04,646
- we're sitting here like, "What?"
- Yeah.

1251
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:08,191
You were looking at this
and thinking, "What?"

1252
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:10,110
- Yeah.
- It's a lie.

1253
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:13,071
<i>That's...
It's a conspiracy theory.</i>

1254
01:07:13,155 --> 01:07:16,867
I was scared
that I would never find Tutar.

1255
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,536
<i>But then something amazings
happened while I was looking</i>

1256
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:22,497
<i>for QAnon stories

1257
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:25,167
- Does this...
- Hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1258
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,668
- Mm-hmm?
- Wait, wait, wait.

1259
01:07:26,752 --> 01:07:28,670
This look like Tutar.

1260
01:07:28,754 --> 01:07:32,215
Her hair different,
but this her, this Tutar.

1261
01:07:32,299 --> 01:07:34,301
Where are your pictures?

1262
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:38,013
Can I see your pictures
of her, please?

1263
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:40,807
<i>Okay, just a minute.
You know what?</i>

1264
01:07:40,891 --> 01:07:42,601
I'll be goddamned
if it isn't her.

1265
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:43,852
It does look like it.

1266
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:46,813
Screw me in the anoos, this her.

1267
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:48,440
Join me again on Saturday.

1268
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:50,942
<i>I will be reporting live

<i>biggest anti-lockdown protest.</i>

1270
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:55,113
I got to get a pen
that fucking works here.

1271
01:07:55,197 --> 01:07:58,241
"March..."
- "For Our Rights."

1272
01:07:58,325 --> 01:08:00,577
"...For Our Rights Rally."

1273
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,705
- Saturday, June 27.
- That's tomorrow.

1274
01:08:03,789 --> 01:08:05,069
- What? It's tomorrow?
- It's tomorrow.

1275
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,374
Please, please, can we go?

1276
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:07,489
- Buddy, buddy, can we go?
- Listen, listen, listen.

01:08:07,501 --> 01:08:08,794
<i>Buddy, buddy, buddy.
Please.</i>

1278
01:08:08,877 --> 01:08:11,546
Can we go out of lockdown
and find her?

1279
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:12,881
I would think so.

1280
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:14,996
- But if she see me...
- I know, that's what I just said.

1281
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:17,844
<i>...then she will run
the moment she see my face.</i>

1282
01:08:17,928 --> 01:08:20,055
<i>Okay, you have to change
your appearance.</i>

1283
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:21,669
<i>Do something different
with your hair...</i>

1284
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,433
- Yes.
<i>- ...wear different clothes.</i>

1285
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:27,354
<i>If I am disguise,
what is the one thing</i>

1286
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:31,399
<i>that is irresistible

1287
01:08:31,483 --> 01:08:33,276
Rock stars.

1288
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,237
What is it?
- What?

1289
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,988
Onions.

1290
01:08:37,072 --> 01:08:39,491
- Onions?
- Onions.

1291
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:40,826
We have onions.

1292
01:08:40,909 --> 01:08:42,577
- We have onions?!
- Yes.

1293
01:08:42,661 --> 01:08:45,080
- You have onions in this house?!
- Yes.

1294
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:46,748
- I believe we do.
- Yes!

1295
01:08:46,832 --> 01:08:50,085
<i>Thank you, buddy! I love you!
You are my best friend!</i>

1296
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:52,128
- Okay.
- Fuck the social distance.

1297
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,287
<i>We got to get up and fight

very many masks out there.

01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:03,837

instant criminals right now.

1301
01:09:03,849 --> 01:09:05,350
<i>They want to throw you in jail</i>

1302

<i>for what you're doing

1303
01:09:07,269 --> 01:09:08,270
Do you understand that?

1304
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:12,150
<i>They're relying that you guys
continue to shut up</i>

1305
01:09:12,232 --> 01:09:14,526
<i>and sit in your house

1306
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:17,737
<i>We will not comply.</i>

1307
01:09:17,821 --> 01:09:20,031
- Will not comply!
- <i>Now you're talking!</i>

1308
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:24,536
<i>I going to head up to the stage

<i>All right, we got
some great music coming up.</i>

1312
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:37,465
Y'all ready?

1313
01:09:37,549 --> 01:09:40,302

- There he is.
- Oh, my gosh. Look at him.

1319
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:00,655
He's doing it.

1320
01:10:00,739 --> 01:10:02,324
I can't believe he's doing it.

1321

Tutar was going to give herself

1377
01:13:06,216 --> 01:13:09,803
I had restored greatness

Yet something was missings.

1383
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:39,332
Something precious
that I could never replace.

1384
01:13:45,672 --> 01:13:46,923
Hello.

1385
01:13:47,006 --> 01:13:50,385
I, uh, want my daughter
ball and chain, please.

1386
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:52,387
Okay, well, can you step back?

1387
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,472
'Cause you're too close to me.

1388
01:13:54,556 --> 01:13:55,765
Did you take the test?

1389
01:13:55,849 --> 01:13:58,810
To see if I, uh,
had the syphilis?

1390
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:01,271
- Not syphilis.
- Ah, yes.

1391
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:03,481
I had it 15 times.

1392
01:14:03,565 --> 01:14:05,191
Not... That's not good.

1393
01:14:05,275 --> 01:14:07,235
Okay, just stop right there.

1394
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:09,237
- What?
- You have to stop right there.

1395
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,740
- Stop here? Why?
- 'Cause we can talk better that way.

1396
01:14:12,824 --> 01:14:14,993
Can I have
my ball and chain, please?

1397
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:18,329
- Are you finna put it back on her?
- No, of course not.

1398
01:14:18,413 --> 01:14:20,957
She, uh, luckily came
to her senses,

1399
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:26,504
and she is, uh, about
to gift herself to a new owner.

1400
01:14:26,588 --> 01:14:29,090
She will be the happiest woman
in the world, uh,

1401
01:14:29,174 --> 01:14:31,426
just like, uh, Melania.

1402
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:32,886
<i>Can I have my...</i>

1403
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:35,054
<i>Yes, I'm finna get
your ball and chain</i>

1404
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:36,973
<i>- for you.</i>
- Thank you.

1405
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:38,349
You're welcome.

1406
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:44,981
Yes, that's my girl's.

1407
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:46,232
Here you go.

1408
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,652
- What is it?
- That's hers.

1409
01:14:49,736 --> 01:14:52,447
One more thing that she left.

1410
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:01,039
I have a pain
in my, uh, titties.

1411
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:05,251
Maybe because you're giving away
your baby.

1412
01:15:05,335 --> 01:15:06,961
Why would that make
my chest hurt?

1413
01:15:07,045 --> 01:15:08,963
- It should.
- Why?

1414
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:14,302
You're giving a little girl
to a old man.

1415
01:15:17,222 --> 01:15:19,891
That should make
your chest hurt.

1416
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:22,101
It should make your heart hurt.

1417
01:15:38,243 --> 01:15:40,245
Don't you love her?

1418
01:15:40,328 --> 01:15:42,580
You care for her?

1419
01:15:44,374 --> 01:15:46,626
- You care?
- Yes.

1420
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:48,419
Okay.

1421
01:15:48,503 --> 01:15:51,214
<i>So, shouldn't she make
the decision</i>

1422
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:54,175
<i>on who she marries?</i>

1423
01:15:54,259 --> 01:15:56,052
<i>But there is only, uh,
two hours left</i>

1424
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:58,221
<i>before she will meet
with this man.</i>

1425
01:15:58,304 --> 01:15:59,681
That's two hours.

1426
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:02,642
- You got two hours to stop it.
- Yes.

1427
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:07,438
Find your baby and tell her
she don't have to do that.

1428
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:09,983
Thank you so much.

1429
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:11,442
- Okay, I will go.
- Okay.

1430
01:16:11,526 --> 01:16:12,652
Oh, one last thing.

1431
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:15,697
Will you be my new Black wife?

1432
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:18,199
No, sir, I cannot be
your new Black wife.

1433
01:16:18,283 --> 01:16:19,826
Okay.

1434
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,400
<i>As a woman,
you have to be</i>

1435
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:54,235
<i>kind of weak.</i>

1436
01:16:56,321 --> 01:17:00,116
<i>No more strong.
We can't be strong anymore.</i>

1437
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:24,098
- Nice to meet you, my dear.
- Nice to meet you.

1438
01:17:24,182 --> 01:17:27,101
- You're one of my greatest heroes.
- Oh, that's so nice.

1439
01:17:27,185 --> 01:17:29,020
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yes.

1440
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:30,563
<i>I will try my best,</i>

1441
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,565
<i>but because I am
super excited and nervous...</i>

1442
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,108
<i>Well, you relax.
I'll relax.</i>

1443
01:17:34,192 --> 01:17:35,860
You want me
to ask you questions?

1444
01:17:36,903 --> 01:17:39,322
- I'll relax you, okay?
- Yes.

1445
01:17:39,405 --> 01:17:42,784
<i>Thank you. I feel like
I'm living in a fairy tale.</i>

1446
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:44,494
Come here.

1447
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:46,204
You're gonna do great, okay?

1448
01:18:05,139 --> 01:18:06,849
Where are you going?
- <i>Upstairs.</i>

1449
01:18:06,933 --> 01:18:08,476
No, you are not going up there.

1450
01:18:08,559 --> 01:18:10,674
But I must defend my daughter's
vagine from America's mayor.

1451
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:12,063
Let me see your I.D.!

1452
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:14,649
So, please take this.

1453
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:18,569
It used to belong to my father,
but I think you should keep it.

1454
01:18:18,653 --> 01:18:19,946
It... Whoa. My God.

1455
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:21,823
That's wonderful
that you gave this to me.

1456
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:23,991
So, uh...

1457
01:18:26,494 --> 01:18:27,703
Well, thank you, my dear.

1458
01:18:27,787 --> 01:18:30,373
Get out or I'm calling
the police!

1459
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:31,833
Time running out.

1460
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:34,836
<i>Please. His old chram
will soon be turgid.</i>

1461
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,257
A little bit about China.

1462
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,217
<i>As an expert
of national security,</i>

1463
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,553
<i>what do you think
we can do going forward</i>

1464
01:18:43,636 --> 01:18:45,304
<i>to prevent this
for happening again?</i>

1465
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:51,102
W-Well, China manufactured
the virus and let it out.

1466
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:54,355
And they deliberately spread it
all around the world.

1467
01:18:54,439 --> 01:18:56,941
- I don't think anybody was eating bats.
- Yeah.

1468
01:18:57,024 --> 01:18:59,193
- Did you ever have a bat?
- Oh, no.

1469
01:18:59,277 --> 01:19:01,446
<i>I don't think
I will ever...</i>

1470
01:19:01,529 --> 01:19:02,780
Eat a bat.

1471
01:19:02,864 --> 01:19:04,198
If you eat a bat with me.

1472
01:19:04,282 --> 01:19:06,105
- Okay, I will. I'll eat a bat with you.
- Can we try?

1473
01:19:07,452 --> 01:19:10,037
<i>You're so funny.</i>

1474
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:26,262
Uh, in the panty-house.
Uh, ooh.

1475
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:28,222
So, probably
in a rough estimate,

1476
01:19:28,306 --> 01:19:30,683
how many lives
President Trump saved?

1477
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,602
I'd say he's saved
a million lives.

1478
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:34,550
<i>There would've been a million
more had he, had he waited</i>

1479
01:19:34,562 --> 01:19:36,871
<i>that month, the way the
Democrats would've done.</i>

1480
01:19:36,883 --> 01:19:37,648
Yeah.

1481
01:19:37,732 --> 01:19:39,859
<i>Uh, but he acted swiftly,</i>

1482
01:19:39,942 --> 01:19:41,944
<i>he acted before anybod...
In fact,</i>

1483
01:19:42,028 --> 01:19:45,740
<i>even his own,
even his own advisors...</i>

1484
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:48,284
<i>- some of them advised him not to do it.</i>
- Really?

1485
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:50,995
Yeah.

1486
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:53,372
<i>I'm good. Oh, here,
a little bit does some good?</i>

1487
01:19:53,456 --> 01:19:55,625
Here you go.
Yeah. It's always good.

1488
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:57,043
Never been in front
of the camera.

1489
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:58,574
<i>I've always been
behind of the camera,</i>

1490
01:19:58,586 --> 01:19:59,921
<i>but today,
something with this...</i>

1491
01:20:00,004 --> 01:20:01,494
Uh, I think you're gonna
look pretty good.

1492
01:20:01,506 --> 01:20:03,090
: We will see.

1493
01:20:03,174 --> 01:20:04,717
Yeah, you're gonna look
pretty good.

1494
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,636
- But it's because of you.
- Well, thank you.

1495
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:09,680
I really feel like Melania
right now.

1496
01:20:09,764 --> 01:20:11,599
Well, you're doing very well.

1497
01:20:11,682 --> 01:20:13,162
So I think you're gonna
look pretty...

1498
01:20:13,184 --> 01:20:14,227
Sorry to interrupt, Mayor.

1499
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,230
Um, sound problem.

1500
01:20:17,313 --> 01:20:18,773
I think we cancel interview.

1501
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:20,399
Mm-hmm?

1502
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:22,041
Uh, I don't think we
need, uh... because...

1503
01:20:22,053 --> 01:20:22,568
Yeah.

1504
01:20:22,652 --> 01:20:24,475
- I-I already checked...
- I'll just check your mic.

1505
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:26,155
Okay.

1506
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:27,879
- Is that better?
- Yeah, that's b-better.

1507
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:30,618
Let me just listen in
for a minute.

1508
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:32,036
Yeah.

1509
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:34,121
Is she asking
too many questions?

1510
01:20:34,205 --> 01:20:36,499
No, she's doing great.

1511
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,793
She'd make a very nagging wife.

1512
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:41,170
No!

1513
01:20:41,254 --> 01:20:43,839
If I were you, I would stick
to marrying your cousins.

1514
01:20:43,923 --> 01:20:45,716
Let me check the sound.

1515
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:46,801
Can I check the sound?

1516
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:49,637
Sure.

1517
01:20:50,471 --> 01:20:52,306
<i>Mr. Mayor,
c-can you say something?</i>

1518
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:53,724
Can you say something?

1519
01:20:53,808 --> 01:20:56,102
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Yeah, the sound is perfect.

1520
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:58,342
- It's probably better if I stay and...
- Please, please I-leave.

1521
01:20:58,354 --> 01:21:00,194
<i>No, no, please.
If I need you, I will call you.</i>

1522
01:21:00,273 --> 01:21:02,900
- You sure?
- You will be in the lobby, right?

1523
01:21:02,984 --> 01:21:04,735
Don't do it.

1524
01:21:04,819 --> 01:21:06,696
What? That's what you want.

1525
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:08,364
But it's not what you want.

1526
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:11,242
But I also don't want you
to die.

1527
01:21:11,325 --> 01:21:12,910
Now go! Go.

1528
01:21:12,994 --> 01:21:15,177
What if I take your place and
he makes sexy time with me?

1529
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:15,913
No.

1530
01:21:15,997 --> 01:21:17,248
Leave.

1531
01:21:21,752 --> 01:21:23,701
- I'm so sorry. That's horrible.
- Just relax. Sit down.

1532
01:21:23,713 --> 01:21:25,756
Sit, sit, sit, sit. Okay.

1533
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,216
I'm so sorry for that.

1534
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:28,634
Really, I apologize.

1535
01:21:28,718 --> 01:21:30,845
<i>Apology accepted.</i>
No problem.

1536
01:21:30,928 --> 01:21:32,221
: Okay.
Okay?

1537
01:21:32,305 --> 01:21:35,891
<i>Yeah. Uh, thank you again
for giving me this time.</i>

1538
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:37,810
Shall we have a drink
in the bedroom?

1539
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:41,897
Come here. Come here.
- What?

1540
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:43,441
Hold up.

1541
01:21:43,524 --> 01:21:46,152
- There you go, my dear.
- Okay.

1542
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:48,446
Yeah, you're-you're good.

1543
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:51,657
You can give me your
phone number and your address.

1544
01:21:55,536 --> 01:21:58,372
- Should we slip your jacket?
- Okay.

1545
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,547
Put down your chram!

1546
01:22:06,631 --> 01:22:07,631
Oh!

1547
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:10,259
She 15. She too old for you.

1548
01:22:10,343 --> 01:22:11,373
Why are you dressed like this?

1549
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:13,137
<i>She my daughter.
Please, take me instead.</i>

1550
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,169
- Take my anoos. Don't take him.
- I don't want you.

1551
01:22:15,181 --> 01:22:16,701
No, no, take my anoos.
Do not have her.

1552
01:22:16,766 --> 01:22:18,059
I'm better than him.

1553
01:22:18,142 --> 01:22:19,673
<i>No, I better.
My back pussy very tight.</i>

1554
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:21,479
No, please, my front anoos.

1555
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:23,177
Please, I will let you

1556
01:22:23,189 --> 01:22:24,815
No, I better!

1557
01:22:24,899 --> 01:22:26,388
<i>I can...
I would love to marry you.</i>

1558
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,735
I was in prison many years,

1559
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:29,362
so I have techniques
with my mouth.

1560
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:31,280
<i>Hello? What's going on here?
Look at this guy.</i>

1561
01:22:31,364 --> 01:22:32,657
I forbid this union.

1562
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:34,909
Rudy, Trump will be disappoint.

1563
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:37,870
You are leaving hotel
without golden shower.

1564
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:02,395
That one was close.

1565
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:04,980
You know what I think?

1566
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:09,485
<i>I think you did this because</i>

1567
01:23:09,568 --> 01:23:12,363
<i>you love me
as much as your sons.</i>

1568
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:15,491
No.

1569
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,160
More.

1570
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:25,126
So much more.

1571
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:31,716
What shall we do?

1572
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:34,176
You stay here.

1573
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,889
I will go home.

1574
01:23:39,557 --> 01:23:40,808
To be executed.

1575
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:45,312
- I'm coming with you.
- No, no.

1576
01:23:45,396 --> 01:23:47,565
You want to live in a cage?

1577
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,650
I forbid it.

1578
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:53,320
I get to choose.

1579
01:23:55,156 --> 01:23:57,074
Okay.

1580
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:10,337
This is my final
Will and Testament.

1581
01:24:10,421 --> 01:24:14,717
<i>To my daughter,
I leave everything...</i>

1582
01:24:15,593 --> 01:24:17,595
<i>One anti-semitic chocolate cake,</i>

1583
01:24:18,345 --> 01:24:20,347
<i>also three...</i>

1584
01:24:20,431 --> 01:24:21,849
<i>...Fleshlights.</i>

1585
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:23,017
Stop.

1586
01:24:27,855 --> 01:24:30,399
We're not going to kill you.

1587
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:34,153
But I failed my mission.

1588
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:36,739
<i>It's okay.
People make mistakes.</i>

1589
01:24:50,753 --> 01:24:52,087
Tatti?

1590
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:02,181
<i>I a total failures.</i>

1591

My whole world fall to pieces.

1592
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:09,688
They make this plague?
- <i>Yes.</i>

1593
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:11,649
<i>And they deliberately spread it</i>

1594
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:13,108
<i>all around the world.</i>

1595
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:16,779
<i>Two Sagdiyev.</i>

1596
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:19,323
I believe it comes
out of that laboratory.

1597
01:25:19,406 --> 01:25:21,367
I don't think anybody
was eating bats.

1598
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,565
Did you ever eat a bat?
- Oh, no.

1599
01:25:23,577 --> 01:25:25,996
Our Premier Nazarbayev,
he grab a lot.

1600
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,123
He can do whatever
he wants, right?

1601
01:25:28,207 --> 01:25:30,459
He sent you
a bunch of angry faces.

1602
01:25:33,087 --> 01:25:36,215
<i>I go to America!</i>

1603
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:38,539
So, what if they
spread it all around the world?

1604
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:41,470
<i>The Wuhan flu.</i>

1605
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:46,267
Wawaweewa!

1606
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:48,185
You the Forrest the Gumps!

1607
01:25:48,269 --> 01:25:50,145
- Hi.
- Please, uh, make autograph?

1608
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:51,230
Sure.

1609
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:54,859
- How do you spell your name?
- Uh, B...

1610
01:25:54,942 --> 01:25:57,444
We have 15 cases of coronavirus.

1611
01:25:57,528 --> 01:25:59,446
<i>We're ready.
We're ready for anything.</i>

1612
01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:00,781
Why, uh, you wear mask?

1613
01:26:00,865 --> 01:26:01,865
'Cause of

1614
01:26:01,907 --> 01:26:04,201
the virus that's going around.

1615
01:26:04,285 --> 01:26:06,233
<i>It's gone worldwide.
It's all around the world.</i>

1616
01:26:07,454 --> 01:26:08,998
<i>It's in the air.
It's everywhere.</i>

1617
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:10,561
And then you get sick.

1618
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:13,168
I'm good.

1619
01:26:13,252 --> 01:26:15,296
"Stupid foreign reporter."

1620
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:17,172
You will die.

1621
01:26:18,132 --> 01:26:19,633
Wawaweewa.

1622
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:30,853
STOP!

1623
01:26:32,897 --> 01:26:37,526
You used me to spread the virus
around the world.

1624
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:39,445
Yes I did.

1625
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:41,155
And our plan worked brilliantly.

1626
01:26:41,238 --> 01:26:44,158
We got our revenge on the world
for them laughing on us.

1627
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:45,659
Did you hear that, Brian?

1628
01:26:45,743 --> 01:26:48,746
- Yes, sir.
- If anything happens to me,

boyfriends, Jim and Jerry.

1630

What is that magical calculator?

1631
01:26:54,752 --> 01:26:56,921
It's called a phone.

1632
01:26:57,504 --> 01:26:58,756
Who is that?

1633
01:26:58,839 --> 01:27:01,300
America's Minister
of Technology.
