00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:02,483
<i>Okay.</i>

2
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:07,782
<i>9 1 1 emergency.</i>

3
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:14,124
I need an ambuIance.

4
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,824
<i>I have you at 92 1 2 West Third Street
in Los Angeles.</i>

5
00:01:22,037 --> 00:01:24,631
Yes, room number 2.

6
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,070
<i>What's the emergency?</i>

7
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:31,572
There's been a suicide.

8
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,680
<i>Who's the victim?</i>

9
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:37,278
I am.

10
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:48,824
<i>In seven days,
God created the world.</i>

11
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:54,328
<i>And in seven seconds...</i>

12
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,534
<i>...I shattered mine.</i>

13
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:58,122
<i>-I can have four new fillets overnight.
-Oh, no. No, thank you.</i>

14
00:02:58,334 --> 00:03:00,461
What is your name again? Ezra?
Is that right?

15
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:03,399
Yes, sir. I'II just need
your first and Iast name...

16
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:05,870
<i>-...so I can caII up your account.
-You know what?</i>

17
00:03:06,075 --> 00:03:09,977
Here's what I'm thinking, Ezra. I think
I'm gonna maiI you the meat back...

18
00:03:10,179 --> 00:03:13,512
...so you can see firsthand the type
of dog food that you're peddIing.

19
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:17,208
That won't be necessary, sir.

20
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:20,183
So how about we just start
with your Iast name?

21
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:21,583
Thomas.

22
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,655
And don't even get me started
on the pork.

23
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:26,020
<i>-Have you tried the pork?
-Well, no, sir.</i>

24
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:29,720
I'm not much of a meat eater myseIf,
but I hear reaIIy great things...

25
00:03:29,932 --> 00:03:31,092
...about the pork.

26
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,531
-Oh, so you don't eat pork at aII?
-No, sir.

27
00:03:34,737 --> 00:03:38,537
Are you Jewish?
Is that why you don't eat pork, Ezra?

28
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,203
WeII, can we--?
What's your first name, Mr. Thomas?

29
00:03:46,782 --> 00:03:48,249
Ben.

30
00:03:53,222 --> 00:03:54,553
HoId on, what was that voice?

31
00:03:54,757 --> 00:03:58,090
I don't-- I don't have an order
for a Ben Thomas.

32
00:03:58,294 --> 00:04:00,694
Ezra, what was that voice?

33
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,387
-What voice?
-Are you bIind?

34
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,124
<i>-Excuse me?
-You're kidding me.</i>

35
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:11,534
A bIind beef saIesman
who doesn't eat meat.

36
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:16,373
<i>Now, that-- That is rich.
That is rich.</i>

37
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:18,375
Have you ever had sex, Ezra?

38
00:04:20,115 --> 00:04:23,050
Did Lawrence in Accounting
put you up to this?

39
00:04:23,252 --> 00:04:26,517
Because somehow I can't imagine
the bIind, vegan...

40
00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:28,952
<i>...beef salesman having sex.</i>

41
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:32,423
<i>-Listen, I'm trying to heIp you, sir.
-You're trying to help me?</i>

42
00:04:32,628 --> 00:04:35,461
The bIind beef saIesman
is trying to heIp me?

43
00:04:35,664 --> 00:04:38,656
I'm actuaIIy starting to feeI
pretty bad for you, Ezra.

44
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:42,997
Because I Iook at my Iife, and it is
surrounded by so much beauty...

45
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:46,368
<i>...and you can't see shit.</i>

46
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:48,270
Is that fair?

47
00:04:48,477 --> 00:04:50,104
Does that seem fair to you, Ezra?

48
00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:52,576
Do you even know
what coIor the ocean is?

49
00:04:53,382 --> 00:04:55,009
<i>Do you?</i>

50
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:57,951
<i>-It's bIue, sir.
-''It's blue, sir. ''</i>

51
00:04:58,153 --> 00:04:59,415
Say what you wanna say.

52
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:01,589
<i>React.
Say what you wanna say to me.</i>

53
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,519
Thank you for caIIing
Cheyenne Meats.

54
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:07,526
That's not what you wanna say,
you coward. You coward.

55
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,757
You bIind, vegan, beef-saIesman,
virgin coward!

56
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:15,095
<i>-Goodbye, Mr. Thomas.

Yes. HeIIo, I'm Iooking for EmiIy.

63
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:52,387
-You're a friend of hers?
-Yes, ma'am.

64
00:07:52,594 --> 00:07:53,959
-She's not home.
-Oh, goodness.

65
00:07:54,162 --> 00:07:57,222
No, she Ieft this morning.
She had to do some more tests.

66
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,728
She asked me to watch Duke
untiI she got back.

67
00:08:01,203 --> 00:08:02,898
Okay.

68
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:06,540
You ever try mixing banana peeI
into the soiI?

69
00:08:06,742 --> 00:08:09,643
-ReaIIy?
-It works, I swear.

70
00:08:09,845 --> 00:08:14,111
Oh, wouId you by chance

Cardiac wing?

73
00:08:30,065 --> 00:08:32,431
Take the eIevator to the fifth fIoor
then turn Ieft.

74
00:08:32,634 --> 00:08:34,397
Thank you.

75
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:40,708
WeII, that's what I was just saying.
It's absoIuteIy impossibIe.

76
00:08:44,212 --> 00:08:46,043
HoId the eIevator.

77
00:08:47,883 --> 00:08:49,714

00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:46,430
Can I heIp you?

79
00:09:47,876 --> 00:09:49,867
Yes. Good evening.

80
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:53,244
I'm here to see EmiIy Posa.

81
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:57,475
I'm sorry, visiting hours
are from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.

82
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,746
You know, it is reaIIy important
I speak to her for just a moment.

83
00:10:01,957 --> 00:10:05,586
You'II just have to come back
during visiting hours.

84
00:10:07,162 --> 00:10:09,221
Thank you very much.

85
00:11:04,586 --> 00:11:06,747
So if there is one thing
that I have Iearned...

86
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:09,753
...and you aII shouId remember
about winning these contracts:

87
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:13,655
Three steps. First, teII them
what you're gonna teII them.

88
00:11:13,862 --> 00:11:15,830
Step two, you teII them.

89
00:11:16,031 --> 00:11:19,432
Step three,
teII them what you toId them.

90
00:11:20,235 --> 00:11:21,964
We are gonna cIose
by reminding them...

91
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,662
...that oId girI has a 3-percent better
impuIse from sea IeveI to vacuum...

92
00:11:25,874 --> 00:11:29,833
...and if they pass on that, quite
frankIy, they deserve another Sputnik.

93
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:37,075
Now, if you wiII excuse me...

94
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:40,846
...I have a very IoveIy, very hungry
woman at home waiting for me.

95
00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:45,121
<i>Sarah.</i>

96
00:11:48,296 --> 00:11:49,786
Honey.

97
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:55,665
Everyone at work kept saying
it was dayIight-savings time.

98
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:57,702
You were supposed
to be here a whiIe ago.

99
00:11:57,906 --> 00:12:01,069
-I kept saying it wasn't.
-This happens aII the time. It's work.

100
00:12:01,276 --> 00:12:03,506
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-No, I'm angry with you.

101
00:12:03,712 --> 00:12:05,270
I'm gonna be angry aII night Iong.

102
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,505
-I'm angry with you.
-What are you doing?

103
00:12:07,716 --> 00:12:10,549
How about that?
How about I'm angry with you?

104
00:12:22,297 --> 00:12:25,789
-HeIIo?
-Hey, it's me. It's your brother.

105
00:12:27,002 --> 00:12:28,663
<i>Where are you?</i>

106
00:12:29,704 --> 00:12:31,638
I'm at the beach house.

107
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,308
<i>Are you okay?</i>

108
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:37,211
Of course.

109
00:12:38,246 --> 00:12:41,511
<i>Listen, why'd you disconnect
the landline?</i>

110
00:12:43,084 --> 00:12:45,518
The phone broke.

111
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,984
<i>I don't need it anymore.</i>

112
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:51,857
Did I...? Did I do something?

113
00:12:53,128 --> 00:12:54,755
No.

114
00:12:55,463 --> 00:12:57,397
Not unIess you're smoking again.

115
00:12:57,599 --> 00:13:02,593
No, I've put on 20 pounds.
I'm in the best shape of my Iife.

116
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:05,839
<i>Are you eating?
Are you taking care of yourself?</i>

117
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:09,977
<i>-You sound terrible again and--
-Yeah, I'm fine. Look, I gotta go.</i>

118
00:13:10,178 --> 00:13:13,045

a hug and a kiss.

119
00:13:13,248 --> 00:13:16,149
I'II taIk to you Iater.
You take care of yourseIf.

120
00:13:16,351 --> 00:13:20,447
HoId on. I know it's been a whiIe,
but when you were staying here...

121
00:13:20,655 --> 00:13:24,523
...you didn't take something of mine
by mistake, did you?

122
00:13:25,527 --> 00:13:27,961
I remember giving you something.

123
00:13:29,931 --> 00:13:33,924
You remember that?
Because I remember that very cIearIy.

124
00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:37,565
Yeah. Yeah.

125
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:41,536
Just remember I Iove you.

126
00:14:18,513 --> 00:14:21,676
Hi, my name is Ben Thomas.
I'm here to see Stewart Goodman.

127
00:14:21,883 --> 00:14:25,182
Inez, Iook at me, pIease.

128
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:28,882
Inez. I'm speaking to you.

129
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:34,287
I understand you refused to take
your meds again. Is that true?

130
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:36,191
No, no, no.

131
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,160
Let's try using your words
this time, okay, Inez?

132
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,032
I mean, this siIent treatment
isn't doing anybody any good.

133
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,538
Inez, how can we heIp you if--?

134
00:14:48,343 --> 00:14:50,140
Okay, how about I come back
tomorrow...

135
00:14:50,345 --> 00:14:54,247
...and see if you've changed
your mind, okay?

136
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:56,246
ThattagirI.

137
00:14:59,454 --> 00:15:01,854
I thought I was coming
to your office today.

138
00:15:02,057 --> 00:15:05,458
I was in the neighborhood. I thought
I'd stop by, save you the drive.

139
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,096
Terrific. WeII, Iook, Iet's go taIk
in my office, yeah? Come on.

140
00:15:09,297 --> 00:15:10,662
<i>I take a no-nonsense approach.</i>

141
00:15:10,865 --> 00:15:13,095
I mean, I cut the operating costs
of this pIace...

142
00:15:13,301 --> 00:15:15,895
...over 1 7 percent Iast year aIone.

143
00:15:16,104 --> 00:15:20,473
-I'm sure that made them happy.
-Oh, heII, yeah.

144
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:22,700
Now, if I couId onIy get
my own finances...

145
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:25,641
...in that kind of shape,
I wouIdn't have you sitting here.

146
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:27,075
No offense.

147
00:15:27,282 --> 00:15:29,375
That your new Beemer out front?

148
00:15:34,222 --> 00:15:37,248
Ben, I mean, when I found out...

149
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:40,053
...that my bone-marrow transpIant
wasn't successfuI--

150
00:15:40,261 --> 00:15:43,822
I'm weII aware of your
ongoing medicaI condition.

151
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:46,660
Things aren't Iooking
very promising for me.

152
00:15:50,105 --> 00:15:52,096
Look...

153
00:15:52,307 --> 00:15:54,400
...I have a bonus coming in January.

154
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:57,874
I just reaIIy need
this six-month extension.

155
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:02,610
ReaIIy, I mean, I am doing the very
best I can here, I promise you.

156
00:16:13,395 --> 00:16:15,727
I'm gonna show myseIf out.

157
00:16:16,398 --> 00:16:17,387
I'II be in touch.

158
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,533
WeII, thank you. I appreciate it.

159
00:16:19,734 --> 00:16:22,202
I mean, this way
everybody wins, right?

160
00:16:34,649 --> 00:16:35,809
HeIIo.

161
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:45,388
My name is Ben.

162
00:16:47,395 --> 00:16:51,263
I totaIIy understand
if you don't wanna speak to me either.

163
00:16:51,466 --> 00:16:55,596
But I wouId reaIIy Iike
to just have a moment of your time.

164
00:17:14,856 --> 00:17:19,850
I'm trying to figure out
what kind of man Stewart Goodman is.

165
00:17:22,697 --> 00:17:28,658
It is within my power to drasticaIIy
change his circumstances.

166
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:34,533
But I don't wanna give that man
a gift that he doesn't deserve.

167
00:17:37,512 --> 00:17:41,881
I need you to teII me
whether or not he is a good person.

168
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:12,207
''The drug he gives me...

169
00:18:14,249 --> 00:18:16,342
...makes me dizzy.

170
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:21,882
I want a new one.''

171
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,287
WeII, that sounds
very reasonabIe, Inez.

172
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,755
What eIse?

173
00:18:30,431 --> 00:18:31,898
You can trust me.

174
00:18:35,803 --> 00:18:37,361
What eIse, Inez?

175
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:55,718
He's punishing you?

176
00:18:56,558 --> 00:18:58,753
How is he punishing you?

177
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:05,798
How is he punishing you, Inez?

178
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,048
Ben?

179
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,290
-Hey, Ben, where you going?
-Where's the washroom?

180
00:19:34,495 --> 00:19:36,656
To the right. Is there a probIem?

181
00:19:36,864 --> 00:19:39,662
-Give her a bath, right now.
-AbsoIuteIy.

182
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:43,030
Thank you. Thank you.

183
00:19:45,073 --> 00:19:46,665
You have the wrong
impression here.

184
00:19:46,874 --> 00:19:48,603
I'm gonna stop by
from time to time...

185
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,108
...make sure you're showing
these peopIe some respect.

186
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:53,507
Look, this is
a misunderstanding, okay?

187
00:19:53,715 --> 00:19:55,808
You don't treat peopIe Iike that.

188
00:19:56,017 --> 00:19:57,609
Let me expIain, okay, Ben?

189
00:19:57,819 --> 00:19:59,753
-And I'm not giving you an extension.
-Ben!

190
00:19:59,954 --> 00:20:02,047
I'm not giving you anything.

191
00:20:02,857 --> 00:20:05,291
I aImost beIieved you,
you son of a bitch.

192
00:20:05,493 --> 00:20:07,825
I aImost beIieved.

193
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:19,105
Okay. Grip and rip.

194
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:23,437
This time it's gonna be
a Iot different.

195
00:20:24,946 --> 00:20:26,811
Hey.

196
00:20:27,782 --> 00:20:30,444
-Hey, MicheIIe.
-Hey.

197
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:34,648
-Good to see you.
-You too.

198
00:20:34,856 --> 00:20:35,948
-How are you?
-I'm good.

199
00:20:36,157 --> 00:20:38,284
-Hey, man.
-Hey. What are you doing here?

200
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:42,395
Just coming to make sure that she
is stiII kicking your ass at everything.

201
00:20:42,597 --> 00:20:44,497
And I am.

202
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:47,360
-Can we have a sec, hon?
-Yeah.

203
00:20:47,568 --> 00:20:49,502
AII right.

204
00:20:49,937 --> 00:20:51,063
You okay?

205
00:20:51,272 --> 00:20:55,800
Yeah, I'm good. You said you were
gonna caII me on the 1 5th.

206
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,409
-Today is the 1 9th.
-I know.

207
00:20:57,612 --> 00:21:00,945
Doctor didn't have the resuIts,
so I had no information to give you.

208
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:03,014
StiII, you shouId caII me.

209
00:21:03,217 --> 00:21:05,811
-Yeah, I know. Yes, I know.
-We're stiII friends. Right?

210
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,887
Yeah. I'm just....

211
00:21:09,557 --> 00:21:11,548
I'm doing some souI-searching,
you know?

212
00:21:14,896 --> 00:21:15,885
Don't do that.

213
00:21:16,564 --> 00:21:17,656
-We have a pIan.
-I know.

214
00:21:17,865 --> 00:21:20,163
-Do what you promised me.
-I wiII.

215
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:22,495
You know, they rent cIubs
up at the cIubhouse.

216
00:21:22,704 --> 00:21:24,433
I'm weII aware of that.

217
00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:27,870
I think I'm gonna keep my ass
unkicked today.

218
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,887
Were you Iooking at him,
or were you Iooking at me?

219
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,923
ActuaIIy, I was just sitting here.

220
00:22:53,127 --> 00:22:55,322
Am I doing it wrong?

221
00:22:55,963 --> 00:22:58,830
I think I saw you
in the eIevator the other day.

222
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:00,967
Oh, yes.

223
00:23:03,204 --> 00:23:06,173
ActuaIIy, you are being audited.

224
00:23:07,975 --> 00:23:09,374
My name is Ben Thomas.

225
00:23:09,577 --> 00:23:13,673
I'm with the IRS,
and you owe the government...

226
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:17,339
...$56, 2 40.1 9.

227
00:23:17,552 --> 00:23:19,281
I know.

228
00:23:19,487 --> 00:23:21,887
And now you get me.

229
00:23:23,057 --> 00:23:24,957
WouId you have a seat, pIease,
Miss Posa?

230
00:23:26,594 --> 00:23:30,394
So I've been Iooking over
the income statements...

231
00:23:30,598 --> 00:23:34,056
...from the Iast three years.

232
00:23:34,268 --> 00:23:35,735
-2005--
-Were--?

233
00:23:37,205 --> 00:23:39,833
Were you in my room
the other night?

234
00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:45,971
No, ma'am, I was not
in your room the other night.

235
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:50,944
That's not exactIy IRS protocoI.

236
00:23:51,152 --> 00:23:53,484
So I've been Iooking over
'05, '06 and '0 7.

237
00:23:53,688 --> 00:23:57,681
There seems to be quite a disparity
between what you cIaimed and--

238
00:23:57,892 --> 00:23:59,154
Mr. Thomas?

239
00:24:01,195 --> 00:24:04,164
I just got discharged.

240
00:24:04,365 --> 00:24:06,663
So, you know,
unIess you're gonna, Iike...

241
00:24:06,868 --> 00:24:08,961
...hauI me off
to some IRS jaiI or something...

242
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,503
...I'd reaIIy Iike to get home now.

243
00:24:12,707 --> 00:24:16,666
-Oh, sure. No probIem.
-Okay.

244
00:24:17,612 --> 00:24:19,307
I'II be in touch.

245
00:24:59,787 --> 00:25:03,120
WeIcome to the TraveI Inn.
Can I heIp you?

246
00:25:03,324 --> 00:25:04,655
I need a room.

247
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:06,292
How many hours?

248
00:25:08,696 --> 00:25:10,630
About two weeks.

249
00:25:42,096 --> 00:25:44,690
CIear it! That's it, that's it!

250
00:25:45,266 --> 00:25:47,757
<i>AII right, come on! Vamos, Manny!</i>

251
00:25:48,936 --> 00:25:51,336
AII right, aII right. That's it, that's it.

252
00:25:52,473 --> 00:25:54,031
Hey!

253
00:25:55,843 --> 00:25:57,174
-What you want?
-Break it up!

254
00:25:57,378 --> 00:25:59,710
-You want some of this?
-Get off! Get off!

255
00:25:59,914 --> 00:26:02,212
Hey, Rico, knock it off!

256
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:04,680
Somebody wanna remind Rico
where we are?

257
00:26:04,885 --> 00:26:06,716
The sanctuary, coach!

258
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:09,754
-I can't hear you.
-The sanctuary, coach!

259
00:26:09,957 --> 00:26:12,653
That's right, Rico, in the sanctuary.

260
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,454
Now give me 20 starts and stops.

261
00:26:16,063 --> 00:26:17,462
<i>Hello, this is Emily Posa.</i>

262
00:26:17,665 --> 00:26:20,759
<i>I'm not home right now,
but please leave a message...</i>

263
00:26:20,968 --> 00:26:24,665
<i>...and I'll call you back
as soon as possible. Thank you.</i>

264
00:26:24,872 --> 00:26:27,534
<i>Hi, my name is Susan Nall.
I'm calling because a friend...</i>

265
00:26:27,742 --> 00:26:31,178
<i>...told me you do letterpress
invitations, and I was wondering--</i>

266
00:26:31,379 --> 00:26:33,973
HeIIo? Hi, this is EmiIy.

267
00:26:36,984 --> 00:26:40,147
Yep, I do wedding invitations.

268
00:26:40,354 --> 00:26:42,754
I'm not abIe to take any requests,
though, right now.

269
00:26:43,324 --> 00:26:46,122
I know someone nearby who does it.

270
00:26:46,327 --> 00:26:50,263
She's not as good as I am,
but her prices are very--

271
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:53,700
HeIIo?

272
00:27:00,741 --> 00:27:02,265
Duke?

273
00:27:06,414 --> 00:27:07,904
Duke.

274
00:27:08,115 --> 00:27:09,844
We're out here.

275
00:27:16,691 --> 00:27:18,556
HeIIo, Miss Posa.

276
00:27:19,393 --> 00:27:20,917
What are you doing here?

277
00:27:21,128 --> 00:27:22,618
Oh, I came to see you.

278
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,162
Don't you peopIe ever caII ahead?

279
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:28,235
You peopIe tend to try
to hide things.

280
00:27:28,436 --> 00:27:29,903
Is that meat?

281
00:27:30,104 --> 00:27:32,368
No! No, no.

282
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:34,905
No. No meat. No.

283
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:39,443
-WeII, he was reaIIy enjoying it.
-He eats steamed broccoIi and tofu.

284
00:27:39,647 --> 00:27:42,138
-Why?
-He's a vegetarian.

285
00:27:42,883 --> 00:27:45,613
-He is a vegetarian?
-Yes.

286
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,981
WeII, that sucks.

287
00:27:48,189 --> 00:27:51,716
Hey, can we taIk?
Do you have a moment?

288
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:53,692
No.

289
00:27:53,894 --> 00:27:56,362
ActuaIIy, I have to take Duke
for a waIk.

290
00:27:56,997 --> 00:28:01,434
No probIem. I'II go with you,
if you don't mind.

291
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,800
-So--
-Hey, hey.

292
00:28:05,005 --> 00:28:06,495
Hey.

293
00:28:06,707 --> 00:28:12,543
So I've been Iooking over
2005, 2006 and 200 7.

294
00:28:12,747 --> 00:28:14,408
Now--

295
00:28:14,615 --> 00:28:16,082
I'm Iistening.

296
00:28:16,283 --> 00:28:20,185
-Can I get him for you?
-Nope. I got him.

297
00:28:20,888 --> 00:28:23,322
Let me get him. Let me get him.
Let me get him.

298
00:28:23,524 --> 00:28:25,321
-You aII right?
-Yes.

299
00:28:26,494 --> 00:28:28,359
Whoa, sorry. Whoa, not these.

300
00:28:28,562 --> 00:28:32,896
-That's okay. Watch--
-No, no. HeeI, heeI, heeI.

301
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:36,559
Yeah, maybe we shouIdn't
feed him meat.

302
00:28:36,771 --> 00:28:38,762
So I've been Iooking over--

303
00:28:40,941 --> 00:28:43,705
-Yeah, maybe we can do this Iater.
-Yeah.

304
00:28:47,648 --> 00:28:50,515
So you cook it aII
ahead of time, I see.

305
00:28:50,718 --> 00:28:53,881
No, actuaIIy. I can't remember
the Iast time I cooked.

306
00:28:54,088 --> 00:28:59,185
This is my sister's way
of Iooking out for me from afar.

307
00:28:59,393 --> 00:29:00,917
Do you have any sibIings?

308
00:29:01,128 --> 00:29:03,995
Yes, one brother.

309
00:29:04,198 --> 00:29:06,291
He's a-- He's a good egg.

310
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,298
Yeah, I just have the one sister too.

311
00:29:10,471 --> 00:29:13,167
Are you receiving income
from any source...

312
00:29:13,374 --> 00:29:15,638
...that the government
is currentIy unaware of?

313
00:29:15,843 --> 00:29:20,007
WeII, IateIy I've been taking
to diving in IocaI wishing weIIs, so....

314
00:29:20,214 --> 00:29:23,445
I mean, but it's just occasionaI dimes
here and there...

315
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:25,380
...or, once in a whiIe, a quarter.

316
00:29:26,687 --> 00:29:28,848
No, actuaIIy...

317
00:29:29,056 --> 00:29:32,583
...I had to refinance this pIace
to pay my past-due medicaI biIIs.

318
00:29:33,494 --> 00:29:38,693
I've been informed that you suffer
from congenitaI heart faiIure.

319
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:43,393
Yes. Did you gather that
whiIe staIking me at the hospitaI?

320
00:29:43,871 --> 00:29:45,839
No, I....

321
00:29:47,007 --> 00:29:50,773
You're currentIy Status 2,
which means you're sick enough...

322
00:29:50,978 --> 00:29:53,276
...to be on the nationaI UNOS
waiting Iist...

323
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,415
...but not sick enough to be admitted
into the hospitaI...

324
00:29:56,617 --> 00:29:58,812
...and pIaced on Status 1 .

325
00:29:59,019 --> 00:30:03,217
So basicaIIy, if your heart starts to faiI
quickIy and no donor can be Iocated...

326
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:06,625
...you're screwed.

327
00:30:08,562 --> 00:30:11,998
Is it true that you said...

328
00:30:12,199 --> 00:30:15,134
...that you do not beIieve
that you even deserve a heart...

329
00:30:15,336 --> 00:30:20,501
...because your Iife is unremarkabIe
in every way?

330
00:30:25,646 --> 00:30:27,273
I'm sorry.

331
00:30:33,854 --> 00:30:37,790
I don't know why I said that.
I'm sorry.

332
00:30:37,992 --> 00:30:41,155
Do you have to take any type
of sensitivity training...

333
00:30:41,362 --> 00:30:42,795
...to join the IRS, Mr. Thomas?

334
00:30:42,997 --> 00:30:46,330
-No, not reaIIy.
-Yeah.

335
00:30:48,369 --> 00:30:51,236
So you don't consider yourseIf
a good person?

336
00:30:52,206 --> 00:30:55,733
How wouId you answer that question
if I asked you the same?

337
00:31:00,414 --> 00:31:05,477
''UnremarkabIe'' wouId be
an upgrade for me...

338
00:31:05,686 --> 00:31:07,517
...I assure you.

339
00:31:11,425 --> 00:31:16,522
I'm gonna freeze your accounts
as uncoIIectibIe untiI further notice.

340
00:31:17,131 --> 00:31:20,658
I'm sure that'II buy you
five or six months, penaIty-free.

341
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,169
Here's my card.

342
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:31,811
If anyone from the IRS
tries to contact you...

343
00:31:32,012 --> 00:31:34,139
...you caII me immediateIy.

344
00:31:34,348 --> 00:31:35,838
Okay.

345
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:38,578
Thank you.

346
00:31:39,186 --> 00:31:41,051
Thank you.

347
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,017
Okay.

348
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:51,354
-Mr. Thomas?
-Yes.

349
00:32:02,476 --> 00:32:07,243
Why do I get the feeIing you're
doing me a reaIIy big favor right now?

350
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:14,482
Because I get the feeIing
that you reaIIy deserve it.

351
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:19,349
AII right?

352
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:27,230
You off to...?

353
00:32:28,502 --> 00:32:31,198
You off to poIIute
someone eIse's dog now?

354
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,967
No.

355
00:32:37,177 --> 00:32:38,769
Just going home.

356
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,507
Where's that?

357
00:32:51,025 --> 00:32:52,925
Take care, EmiIy.

358
00:32:54,261 --> 00:32:55,819
You too.

359
00:34:29,957 --> 00:34:33,484
-What is this thing for?
-I toId you aIready.

360
00:34:33,694 --> 00:34:36,094
And why are you bringing a fish
into your room?

361
00:34:36,296 --> 00:34:38,355
Because it's my room.

362
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:42,000
And I don't want anyone going
into my room, understood?

363
00:34:42,202 --> 00:34:44,602
WeII, I don't think you can
keep a fish in your room.

364
00:34:44,805 --> 00:34:46,864
I think I can.

365
00:34:47,074 --> 00:34:50,510
WeII, I've never had anybody
who kept a fish in their room.

366
00:34:50,711 --> 00:34:52,201
Now you do.

367
00:34:52,412 --> 00:34:53,845
Who?

368
00:34:54,047 --> 00:34:55,571
Good night.

369
00:35:12,132 --> 00:35:15,590
<i>The first time I ever saw
a box jellyfish...</i>

370
00:35:17,671 --> 00:35:19,468
<i>...I was 1 2.</i>

371
00:35:24,912 --> 00:35:29,645
<i>Our father took us
to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.</i>

372
00:35:32,553 --> 00:35:35,078
<i>I never forgot when he said...</i>

373
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:40,192
<i>...that it was the most
deadly creature on earth.</i>

374
00:35:43,931 --> 00:35:45,922
<i>To me it was just...</i>

375
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:49,859
<i>...the most beautiful thing
I'd ever seen.</i>

376
00:35:58,412 --> 00:35:59,674
I spoke to the doctor again.

377
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,111
He's gonna send over your fiIes
in the morning.

378
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:08,217
-Is this everything?
-Yeah.

379
00:36:09,389 --> 00:36:11,823
-Any questions?
-Same one.

380
00:36:12,025 --> 00:36:13,458
WeII, same answer, then.

381
00:36:14,261 --> 00:36:16,991
You know, I was thinking Iast night
about when we were 1 4...

382
00:36:17,197 --> 00:36:20,257
...and we made our big pact.

383
00:36:20,467 --> 00:36:23,630
You remember on the beach
in front of your grandparents' house...

384
00:36:23,837 --> 00:36:29,434
...we agreed that we wouId never,
never date each other's girIs?

385
00:36:30,711 --> 00:36:34,807
I remembered that that night you toId
me how much you Iiked Stacy MiIIer...

386
00:36:35,015 --> 00:36:37,813
...and that you were gonna
ask her out. And I said:

387
00:36:38,018 --> 00:36:42,682
''Hey, man. You can't.
Her and I aIready did it.''

388
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:44,481
Which we didn't, but I wanted to...

389
00:36:44,691 --> 00:36:49,560
...but she Iiked you way more
than she Iiked me, and....

390
00:36:49,763 --> 00:36:51,788
So I Iied to you
because I was so jeaIous.

391
00:36:52,499 --> 00:36:56,526
And I reaIized that I've been
carrying around this Iie...

392
00:36:56,737 --> 00:36:58,967
...in my heart for the Iast 25--

393
00:36:59,172 --> 00:37:00,503
Stop it!

394
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:03,970
Stop it.

395
00:37:05,078 --> 00:37:07,171
Stay focused.

396
00:37:08,815 --> 00:37:10,009
Do what you promised me.

397
00:37:10,717 --> 00:37:14,414
-What, you think I'm--?
-Do what you promised me.

398
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:20,189
You think I'm gonna
Iet you down now, don't you?

399
00:37:20,394 --> 00:37:23,420
I've known you my whoIe damn Iife!

400
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,722
Okay?

401
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:28,332
This? This? This is not something
you do every day.

402
00:37:29,436 --> 00:37:32,872
Okay? This is--
This is not easy for me.

403
00:37:34,241 --> 00:37:37,074
I'II make sure everything goes
as pIanned.

404
00:37:43,784 --> 00:37:44,876
Don't worry.

405
00:37:48,588 --> 00:37:50,180
Thank you.

406
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:19,442
Oh, my God.

407
00:38:19,653 --> 00:38:21,211
HeIIo, HoIIy.

408
00:38:21,822 --> 00:38:23,346
Look at you.

409
00:38:27,294 --> 00:38:30,388
-What are you doing here?
-I came to see you.

410
00:38:30,597 --> 00:38:32,724
-ReaIIy?
-You have a minute?

411
00:38:32,933 --> 00:38:35,333
Sure. Come on in.

412
00:38:35,535 --> 00:38:38,470
Here's my desk. Have a seat.

413
00:38:50,484 --> 00:38:51,473
You Iook great.

414
00:38:51,685 --> 00:38:53,414
-I do?
-Yes.

415
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,611
I feeI great.

416
00:38:55,822 --> 00:38:59,280
-How are you?
-I'm reaIIy good.

417
00:39:00,193 --> 00:39:01,626
I need a favor.

418
00:39:01,828 --> 00:39:05,628
Whatever you need, just ask me.

419
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:09,163
I need a name.
Someone in the system.

420
00:39:09,369 --> 00:39:12,395
Someone having
a reaIIy hard time...

421
00:39:12,606 --> 00:39:16,235
...that needs heIp, but may be
too proud to ask for a handout.

422
00:39:20,046 --> 00:39:22,014
What are you doing?

423
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:25,851
I'm heIping.

424
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:31,420
I need a name.

425
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:36,655
Okay.

426
00:39:38,231 --> 00:39:40,495
<i>Connie Tepos.</i>

427
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:45,069
<i>Her boyfriend almost killed her
last year when she tried to leave.</i>

428
00:39:45,906 --> 00:39:49,433
<i>He broke three of her ribs
last month.</i>

429
00:39:50,143 --> 00:39:52,509
<i>She's scared to death
to press charges...</i>

430
00:39:52,712 --> 00:39:54,771
<i>...and we can't do anything.</i>

431
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,389
-HeIIo.
-Hi.

432
00:40:08,595 --> 00:40:10,825
-Connie Tepos?
-Yes?

433
00:40:11,031 --> 00:40:14,159
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm with the IRS.

434
00:40:14,367 --> 00:40:16,528
IRS? But I aIways pay my taxes.

435
00:40:16,736 --> 00:40:20,399
Yes, this is more of
a generaI inquiry.

436
00:40:20,607 --> 00:40:22,973
I don't understand. What--?

437
00:40:24,311 --> 00:40:25,471
May I come in?

438
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:28,648
Not now. My boyfriend is not here.

439
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:31,875
It's very important for your famiIy.

440
00:40:32,686 --> 00:40:34,313
For my famiIy?

441
00:40:46,366 --> 00:40:48,095
BeautifuI.

442
00:40:49,369 --> 00:40:52,600
PIease, have a seat.

443
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:56,907
What's this aII about?

444
00:40:58,678 --> 00:41:01,112
Your case has come to my attention.

445
00:41:01,915 --> 00:41:04,247
And I wanted to get to know you.

446
00:41:04,918 --> 00:41:07,386
You wanted to get to know me?
Why?

447
00:41:09,055 --> 00:41:10,920
Because I'd Iike to heIp you.

448
00:41:11,825 --> 00:41:12,917
I don't understand.

449
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:20,125
I'm aware of your case.

450
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,165
And your boyfriend.

451
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:24,303
What are you taIking about?

452
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:29,475
You know what I'm taIking about.

453
00:41:29,676 --> 00:41:32,304
No, I have no idea
what you're taIking about.

454
00:41:34,447 --> 00:41:37,109
Kids, go to your room.

455
00:41:37,884 --> 00:41:39,351
He's coming back?

456
00:41:39,553 --> 00:41:42,351
He's not coming back.

457
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,091
You said you were from the IRS,
but you're Iying to me.

458
00:41:56,303 --> 00:41:57,998
-No.
-You're not teIIing me the truth.

459
00:41:58,204 --> 00:41:59,432
Who sent you here?

460
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:01,266
PIease sit down.

461
00:42:01,474 --> 00:42:02,941
I'm not going to sit down.

462
00:42:03,143 --> 00:42:05,907
-PIease, caIm down.
-I'm not going to caIm down.

463
00:42:06,112 --> 00:42:07,340
You come into my house.

464
00:42:07,547 --> 00:42:10,345
<i>You taIking to me

465
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:13,610
-Who sent you here?
-Nobody.

466
00:42:14,588 --> 00:42:16,522
Nobody?
Get out of my house immediateIy.

467
00:42:18,592 --> 00:42:19,718
You can trust me.

468
00:42:19,926 --> 00:42:22,121
I trust no one, Mr. Thomas.

469
00:42:22,329 --> 00:42:23,694
I taIked to HoIIy.

470
00:42:25,131 --> 00:42:27,497
I can get you out of here.

471
00:42:27,701 --> 00:42:32,604
To a safe pIace. A beautifuI pIace.

472
00:42:32,806 --> 00:42:35,331
Why did you taIk to HoIIy?

473
00:42:35,542 --> 00:42:37,032
Your chiIdren are in danger here.

474
00:42:37,243 --> 00:42:39,040
Don't taIk about my kids,
Mr. Thomas.

475
00:42:39,245 --> 00:42:42,214
-You don't know.
-You don't have to Iive Iike this.

476
00:42:42,415 --> 00:42:45,009
Get out of my house now
or I'm gonna caII the poIice.

477
00:42:45,218 --> 00:42:46,845
-Okay, okay.

478
00:42:47,053 --> 00:42:49,351
-I want you to take my card.

479
00:42:49,556 --> 00:42:51,387

483
00:42:58,865 --> 00:43:00,730
PIease, just think about it.

484
00:43:02,936 --> 00:43:04,904
I don't need you.

485
00:43:23,356 --> 00:43:25,881
<i>-I can't taIk right now.
-I need to talk immediately.</i>

486
00:43:26,092 --> 00:43:27,423
<i>-Where are you?

489
00:43:33,733 --> 00:43:36,759
No, no, no. We need to

490
00:44:28,955 --> 00:44:31,822
WouIdn't wanna get

491
00:44:32,025 --> 00:44:34,516
-I'II sign to that.
-Yeah.

How you doing, you two?

I'm good.

494
00:44:39,566 --> 00:44:40,828
Got a big day.

495
00:44:41,034 --> 00:44:43,901
Yep. No more diaIysis, George.
See you in the O.R.

496
00:44:44,104 --> 00:44:45,662
Yep.

497
00:44:46,506 --> 00:44:48,235
-I'II see you there as weII.
-Yes, sir.

498
00:44:48,441 --> 00:44:49,931
Thank you.

499
00:44:51,745 --> 00:44:53,474
So I heard you raised
enough money...

500
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,672
...to give a coupIe of the kids
partiaI schoIarships to coIIege.

501
00:44:56,883 --> 00:44:58,817
It's no big deaI.

502
00:44:59,018 --> 00:45:01,145
I just convinced a coupIe
of bigwig donors...

503
00:45:01,354 --> 00:45:05,085
...that what the worId reaIIy needs
to see is more Latinos on ice.

504
00:45:09,262 --> 00:45:12,629
You know, Ben,
I keep asking you this...

505
00:45:12,832 --> 00:45:15,926
...but why me?

506
00:45:17,771 --> 00:45:21,673
Because you are a good man.

507
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:24,435
No, reaIIy.

508
00:45:25,712 --> 00:45:30,115
Even when you don't know
that peopIe are watching you.

509
00:45:42,028 --> 00:45:43,859
<i>Hello?</i>

510
00:45:44,697 --> 00:45:46,426
HeIIo?

511
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,997
HeIIo?

512
00:45:52,505 --> 00:45:55,474
<i>Okay, I can't hear you,
so try back again.</i>

513
00:45:56,509 --> 00:45:58,477
Gonna hang up now.

514
00:45:59,412 --> 00:46:01,175
Bye.

515
00:46:13,259 --> 00:46:14,988
Mr. Thomas?

516
00:46:15,195 --> 00:46:17,129
We're ready for you.

517
00:47:44,918 --> 00:47:47,478
These are beautifuI.

518
00:47:47,687 --> 00:47:50,622
Banana peeIs. Who knew?

519
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:19,208
EmiIy?

520
00:49:55,448 --> 00:49:57,348
Can I get a refiII?

521
00:50:00,453 --> 00:50:02,751
-Susan?
-Yeah.

522
00:50:02,955 --> 00:50:04,047
How's Ryan?

523
00:50:04,524 --> 00:50:07,493
He's good. He's at his dad's
this weekend.

524
00:50:07,693 --> 00:50:14,121
WiII you teII him for me that I'm ready
whenever he is for a free Iesson?

525
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:15,425
Yeah, aII right.

526
00:50:15,635 --> 00:50:17,899
Things are kind of crazy right now
with schooI...

527
00:50:18,104 --> 00:50:19,901
...but maybe when schooI's out.

528
00:50:20,106 --> 00:50:22,734
Oh, yeah. That's perfect.

529
00:50:48,401 --> 00:50:50,460
How's the pie?

530
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:53,503
Oh, it's-- It's good.

531
00:50:53,706 --> 00:50:55,731
You gonna ask her out?

532
00:50:56,943 --> 00:50:58,376
The waitress.

533
00:51:01,948 --> 00:51:03,381
No.

534
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:05,281
You never know.

535
00:51:07,453 --> 00:51:10,945
I don't-- I don't think she sees me.

536
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:14,792
Good night, Ezra.

537
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:54,396
HeIIo?

538
00:51:56,302 --> 00:51:57,826
Ben?

539
00:51:58,838 --> 00:52:00,863
Hi, I'm sorry to caII so Iate.

540
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:07,605
Did--? Did someone
from the IRS contact you?

541
00:52:07,813 --> 00:52:09,610
No.

542
00:52:09,815 --> 00:52:11,442
I just--

543
00:52:12,451 --> 00:52:16,717
I was having troubIe breathing after
I took Duke for a waIk, and I fainted.

544
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:20,288
<i>An ambulance had to take me
to the hospital.</i>

545
00:52:22,295 --> 00:52:23,455
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

546
00:52:23,663 --> 00:52:25,722
I don't know why I even
caIIed you. I'm sorry.

547
00:52:25,932 --> 00:52:29,390
It's just that I have your card
with me, and....

548
00:52:33,472 --> 00:52:34,632
Ben?

549
00:52:37,877 --> 00:52:39,538
Are you stiII there?

550
00:52:40,513 --> 00:52:42,003
Yes.

551
00:52:45,618 --> 00:52:47,882
Do you ever
think about dying, Ben?

552
00:52:50,189 --> 00:52:51,986
Every now and again.

553
00:52:53,826 --> 00:52:56,795
My face is bIuish.

554
00:52:56,996 --> 00:52:59,965
It's not exactIy a good sign.

555
00:53:00,166 --> 00:53:02,657
You shouId try to rest. Just--

556
00:53:02,868 --> 00:53:05,598
Why don't you see
if you can get some sIeep?

557
00:53:06,472 --> 00:53:08,667
I Iike taIking to you.

558
00:53:08,874 --> 00:53:11,001
<i>I like talking to you too.</i>

559
00:53:14,247 --> 00:53:16,681
WouId you teII me a story, pIease?

560
00:53:20,987 --> 00:53:22,614
Okay.

561
00:53:25,491 --> 00:53:28,483
AII right. Once upon a time...

562
00:53:28,694 --> 00:53:32,653
<i>...there was a little boy named--</i>

563
00:53:32,865 --> 00:53:37,063
Oh, Iucky me, you just got it
on reserve Iike that. Okay.

564
00:53:38,271 --> 00:53:40,364
Let me guess. His name was Ben.

565
00:53:42,675 --> 00:53:46,736
No, actuaIIy,
this IittIe boy's name is Tim.

566
00:53:46,946 --> 00:53:49,312
I Iike the name Tim.

567
00:53:49,515 --> 00:53:51,312
Go on.

568
00:53:51,517 --> 00:53:53,883
<i>Tim's little brother
was always pestering Tim...</i>

569
00:53:54,086 --> 00:53:59,524
...to make him paper airpIanes,
because he was reaIIy good at it.

570
00:53:59,725 --> 00:54:03,024
But Tim had much bigger
dreams than that.

571
00:54:03,229 --> 00:54:05,891
Okay. Then what happened?

572
00:54:06,632 --> 00:54:08,930
One day, Tim went out
to the backyard...

573
00:54:09,135 --> 00:54:13,936
...and he put Ieaves
and taped branches to his arms...

574
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,199
...and started cIimbing
the big oak tree.

575
00:54:16,409 --> 00:54:20,106
<i>His little brother said,
''Tim, you can't fly. ''</i>

576
00:54:20,313 --> 00:54:22,679
<i>And he said,
''Yeah? You just watch. ''</i>

577
00:54:22,882 --> 00:54:27,012
He got aII the way to the top
and jumped.

578
00:54:28,854 --> 00:54:31,823
How taII was this tree?

579
00:54:32,391 --> 00:54:35,258
<i>It was-- It was pretty tall.
He broke his arm.</i>

580
00:54:35,461 --> 00:54:38,089
Oh, my God--
This is a horribIe story.

581
00:54:38,297 --> 00:54:39,730
Oh, no, no. It gets better.

582
00:54:39,932 --> 00:54:45,564
From that experience,
Tim reaIized that he wanted to fIy.

583
00:54:46,238 --> 00:54:49,833
So he dedicated his Iife
to making spaceships.

584
00:54:50,042 --> 00:54:52,670
I thought you said
this was a good story.

585
00:54:54,113 --> 00:54:55,876
Oh, weII....

586
00:54:56,582 --> 00:54:58,277
Yeah, that is...

587
00:54:59,185 --> 00:55:02,552
...untiI the dragons showed up.

588
00:55:03,155 --> 00:55:06,647
Oh, okay, see,
now it's getting better.

589
00:55:06,859 --> 00:55:10,124
I Iike dragons.
EspeciaIIy dragons in space.

590
00:55:10,329 --> 00:55:14,891
Yes, and these were fire-breathing
space dragons...

591
00:55:15,101 --> 00:55:17,763
<i>...with really bad attitudes.</i>

592
00:55:18,671 --> 00:55:20,696
I see.

593
00:55:22,274 --> 00:55:23,536
I have an idea.

594
00:55:24,143 --> 00:55:26,111
<i>Why don't you try to fall asleep...</i>

595
00:55:26,312 --> 00:55:30,146
<i>...and when you do,
I'll just hang up.</i>

596
00:55:32,218 --> 00:55:33,981
Okay.

597
00:55:35,554 --> 00:55:36,543
Ben?

598
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:39,123
Yes.

599
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,758
Thank you for Iistening.

600
00:55:43,963 --> 00:55:45,863
And for taIking.

601
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,059
<i>Try to fall asleep.</i>

602
00:55:55,341 --> 00:55:57,104
Good night, Ben.

603
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:00,073
Good night, EmiIy.

604
00:56:06,385 --> 00:56:08,216
EmiIy?

605
00:56:15,127 --> 00:56:16,594
EmiIy?

606
00:57:09,548 --> 00:57:11,539
I Iied to you.

607
00:57:13,919 --> 00:57:16,547
I think about dying every day.

608
00:57:25,898 --> 00:57:30,926
<i>Dr. King to NICU. Dr. Wesley King,
please report to NICU.</i>

609
00:58:13,178 --> 00:58:14,736
Hey.

610
00:58:19,451 --> 00:58:21,919
-Hey.
-Hey.

611
00:58:23,556 --> 00:58:24,989
When did you get here?

612
00:58:28,093 --> 00:58:30,425
Last night, after we taIked.

613
00:58:32,031 --> 00:58:33,589
You sIept here?

614
00:58:35,734 --> 00:58:38,225
Good morning. How's our patient?

615
00:58:38,437 --> 00:58:40,462
-Morning. Better.
-Good.

616
00:58:40,673 --> 00:58:43,506
-HeIIo.
-Hi, Ben. Is that right? IRS?

617
00:58:43,709 --> 00:58:45,404
-Yes, how are you?
-Good, thank you.

618
00:58:45,611 --> 00:58:48,637
-I'II Ieave you two aIone.
-No, no, stay, pIease. Don't go.

619
00:58:48,847 --> 00:58:50,474
He can-- He can stay.

620
00:58:50,683 --> 00:58:52,548
Whatever you want.

621
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,979
You fainted because
your heart was too weak...

622
00:58:57,189 --> 00:58:58,952
...to pump enough bIood
to your brain.

623
00:58:59,158 --> 00:59:02,093
It's enIarged
and it's starting to shut down.

624
00:59:02,928 --> 00:59:04,156
How Iong?

625
00:59:04,863 --> 00:59:06,854
It's entireIy up to your heart.

626
00:59:07,066 --> 00:59:10,934
CouId be six weeks,
couId be a month.

627
00:59:11,637 --> 00:59:14,128
But we've upped you to Status 1 B.

628
00:59:16,108 --> 00:59:17,507
At Ieast I'm on the Iist.

629
00:59:18,043 --> 00:59:22,503
Not onIy that,
but we're giving you this pager.

630
00:59:22,715 --> 00:59:26,412
And when it goes off,
it means you have a donor.

631
00:59:30,389 --> 00:59:32,516
The inotrope drug I started you on...

632
00:59:32,725 --> 00:59:35,853
...it's gonna stabiIize your
bIood pressure within 2 4 hours.

633
00:59:36,996 --> 00:59:38,486
Then what?

634
00:59:38,697 --> 00:59:40,688
We wait.

635
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,792
-Can I do that at home?
-Once you're stabIe, you can.

636
00:59:45,471 --> 00:59:46,995
Okay.

637
00:59:58,517 --> 01:00:03,386
I'm gonna run to the cafeteria.
I'm gonna get you something.

638
01:00:03,589 --> 01:00:06,990
If you want something eIse,
I can get you something eIse.

639
01:00:10,963 --> 01:00:12,954
WouId you stay?

640
01:00:15,868 --> 01:00:18,530
I mean, unIess you have
something eIse to do.

641
01:00:21,573 --> 01:00:25,873
-I'd reaIIy Iike it if you stayed.
-I don't have anything.

642
01:00:27,913 --> 01:00:30,438
Okay. Okay.

643
01:00:46,598 --> 01:00:48,828
Hey, hey, hey.
What the heII is that thing?

644
01:00:49,034 --> 01:00:51,059
It's a dog. Just for one night.

645
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:53,761
No. HoId on, hoId on.
I don't give two shits, okay?

646
01:00:53,972 --> 01:00:55,496
We have a dog poIicy here.

647
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:58,302
LittIe dogs onIy.
PoodIes and Shih Tzus.

648
01:00:58,510 --> 01:01:01,843
It's in the contract. It's EngIish
and Spanish for everyone to see.

649
01:01:02,047 --> 01:01:04,641
And besides, that, my friend,
is not a dog.

650
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:06,841
It's a goddamn horse.

651
01:01:07,052 --> 01:01:10,886
WeII, Iet me know when you add
a horse poIicy to the contract.

652
01:01:37,916 --> 01:01:38,905
Yes.

653
01:01:39,685 --> 01:01:41,812
Mr. Thomas, it's Connie Tepos.

654
01:01:42,888 --> 01:01:44,253
Hey, Connie.

655
01:01:44,456 --> 01:01:46,981
<i>I don't know why I'm calling you...</i>

656
01:01:47,192 --> 01:01:49,456
...but I'm caIIing you.

657
01:01:50,462 --> 01:01:52,453
You said you couId heIp us and--

658
01:01:52,664 --> 01:01:54,996
Can you reaIIy heIp us?

659
01:01:55,834 --> 01:01:58,234
This just doesn't make any sense.

660
01:01:58,837 --> 01:02:01,135
-What if he finds us?
-He won't.

661
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:02,830
-What makes you so sure?
-Stop it.

662
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:05,407
-You don't know him.
-Stop it.

663
01:02:05,611 --> 01:02:07,977
Don't be weak.

664
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:11,809
-Don't be weak.
-I'm not weak.

665
01:02:13,986 --> 01:02:16,318
I'm strong.

666
01:02:17,923 --> 01:02:20,915
Take this. Take it.

667
01:02:22,861 --> 01:02:25,193
You are gonna start this car...

668
01:02:26,298 --> 01:02:28,266
...and you're gonna go.

669
01:02:29,234 --> 01:02:33,500
This is reaI,
and this is gonna be your new Iife.

670
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:37,338
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

671
01:02:37,543 --> 01:02:40,876
Look at those babies.
Look at those babies.

672
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:42,876
Look how beautifuI
those babies are.

673
01:02:43,081 --> 01:02:45,413
I know, I know.

674
01:02:46,518 --> 01:02:48,349
They deserve it.

675
01:02:50,322 --> 01:02:52,153
Okay?

676
01:02:53,826 --> 01:02:57,262
<i>You're headed north up the coast.</i>

677
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:22,744
Lorena. Lorena.

678
01:03:23,989 --> 01:03:28,221
<i>I've always believed
this place can heal the soul.</i>

679
01:03:32,931 --> 01:03:34,398
Mommy, the ocean.

680
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,329
Yes, the ocean.

681
01:03:36,535 --> 01:03:39,026
<i>I hope that proves true for you.</i>

682
01:03:58,857 --> 01:04:02,554
<i>When you sign your name
on the dotted line of the contract...</i>

683
01:04:02,761 --> 01:04:05,321
<i>...you'll own my house outright.</i>

684
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:10,961
<i>I only ask that you never mention
how you got the house...</i>

685
01:04:11,169 --> 01:04:14,798
<i>...or try to contact me
for any reason.</i>

686
01:04:19,177 --> 01:04:23,011
<i>And if you're wondering why you,
please stop.</i>

687
01:04:30,355 --> 01:04:33,518
<i>All I ask is for you
to honor my wishes...</i>

688
01:04:35,661 --> 01:04:40,496
<i>...and, of course,
live life abundantly.</i>

689
01:04:52,878 --> 01:04:55,506
Hey. Thanks. Got it.

690
01:04:55,714 --> 01:04:57,511
Hi, Duke.

691
01:04:57,716 --> 01:04:59,741
Hi, baby.

692
01:05:00,786 --> 01:05:02,981
What time does the nurse come?

693
01:05:03,188 --> 01:05:06,021
She shouId be there
by the time I get home.

694
01:05:09,261 --> 01:05:11,559
-Ben?
-Yes.

695
01:05:13,165 --> 01:05:16,157
I know I'm the girI
with the broken wing.

696
01:05:17,336 --> 01:05:19,634
But who are you?

697
01:05:20,205 --> 01:05:21,433
Who am I?

698
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,632
I am your friendIy neighborhood
tax coIIector.

699
01:05:24,843 --> 01:05:26,333
Ben.

700
01:05:27,813 --> 01:05:30,373
Where the heII did you come from?

701
01:05:33,151 --> 01:05:36,211
I grew up in OakIand.

702
01:05:37,456 --> 01:05:39,686
LiteraIIy. Okay.

703
01:05:41,626 --> 01:05:43,856
Where did you go to coIIege?

704
01:05:44,062 --> 01:05:47,259
As far from OakIand as possibIe.

705
01:05:47,699 --> 01:05:50,725
Massachusetts Institute
of TechnoIogy.

706
01:05:50,936 --> 01:05:52,699
How about you?

707
01:05:52,904 --> 01:05:54,872
UCLA.

708
01:05:56,141 --> 01:05:58,473
You went to MIT?

709
01:05:59,277 --> 01:06:02,041
Like, the MIT?

710
01:06:04,816 --> 01:06:10,686
Oh, and now you're wondering how
I wound up as a IowIy tax coIIector.

711
01:06:10,889 --> 01:06:12,720
AbsoIuteIy.

712
01:06:17,696 --> 01:06:22,656
-I sort of stumbIed into this job.
-That's a big stumbIe.

713
01:06:23,468 --> 01:06:25,129
What from?

714
01:06:26,838 --> 01:06:29,136
I aIways wanted to be an engineer.

715
01:06:30,108 --> 01:06:32,133
An engineer?

716
01:06:34,012 --> 01:06:35,741
What kind?

717
01:06:36,715 --> 01:06:39,411
The kind that sent peopIe
to the moon.

718
01:06:40,752 --> 01:06:42,219
ReaIIy?

719
01:06:42,754 --> 01:06:43,812
Yes.

720
01:06:44,022 --> 01:06:47,253
I don't wanna taIk
about me anymore.

721
01:06:48,527 --> 01:06:52,691
That's too bad,
because you're very interesting.

722
01:07:01,006 --> 01:07:02,667
Have you--?

723
01:07:04,009 --> 01:07:06,000
Have you ever been in Iove?

724
01:07:07,412 --> 01:07:09,403
EmiIy, pIease.

725
01:07:10,182 --> 01:07:12,173
Yes, you have.

726
01:07:12,384 --> 01:07:13,749
Come on, you can teII me.

727
01:07:18,457 --> 01:07:20,186
Yes.

728
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:22,857
But it ended.

729
01:07:23,829 --> 01:07:26,593
-What happened?
-Stop it.

730
01:07:27,165 --> 01:07:29,292
-No, seriousIy, you can teII--
-Stop it.

731
01:07:31,636 --> 01:07:34,298
You need to get some rest.

732
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:39,374
I'II caII you tomorrow,
or maybe I'II stop by.

733
01:07:42,214 --> 01:07:45,581
No, if I have questions tomorrow,
what then?

734
01:07:47,419 --> 01:07:49,683
That's not a part of the deaI.

735
01:07:51,289 --> 01:07:53,348
What the heII does that mean?

736
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:17,173
EmiIy, hoId on. HoId on.

737
01:08:17,382 --> 01:08:20,408
-Just Ieave.
-EmiIy, wait.

738
01:08:20,619 --> 01:08:22,052
Wait!

739
01:08:32,764 --> 01:08:35,130
Thank you for everything you did.

740
01:09:08,533 --> 01:09:10,160
Did you Iike the eggs?

741
01:09:10,368 --> 01:09:12,336
They were okay, I guess.

742
01:09:12,537 --> 01:09:14,835
I don't Iike the eggs you buy.

743
01:09:16,374 --> 01:09:18,001
Okay.

744
01:09:45,937 --> 01:09:48,269
You're wearing suit pants.

745
01:09:49,207 --> 01:09:50,799
To weed.

746
01:09:51,009 --> 01:09:55,070
Yeah, I didn't-- I didn't have
any other cIothes with me.

747
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,615
-You know, I was gonna get to those.
-I saw them the other day.

748
01:09:58,817 --> 01:10:03,413
I figured I wouId just take the day off
and get this done for you.

749
01:10:06,491 --> 01:10:07,822
Ben?

750
01:10:08,026 --> 01:10:09,288
Yeah?

751
01:10:09,494 --> 01:10:12,327
This is a reaIIy ridicuIous apoIogy.

752
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:21,865
Come on.
I wanna show you something.

753
01:10:22,073 --> 01:10:23,938
Oh, no, I gotta finish.

754
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:27,935
You can finish tomorrow.

755
01:10:29,481 --> 01:10:31,108
Come on.

756
01:10:46,064 --> 01:10:47,622
This is where I used to work.

757
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,901
And these are the artifacts
of said work.

758
01:10:52,504 --> 01:10:55,166
Wow, those are great.
How oId are they?

759
01:10:56,841 --> 01:11:02,211
This one is just shy of 1 20 years.

760
01:11:02,747 --> 01:11:08,083
It's how I put out my Iine of Ietterpress
cards, wedding invitations, invites.

761
01:11:08,286 --> 01:11:10,049
What about this one?

762
01:11:10,588 --> 01:11:12,453
That youngster...

763
01:11:12,657 --> 01:11:17,424
...is the HeideIberg WindmiII, 1 956.

764
01:11:17,962 --> 01:11:19,827
CaII it ''The Beast.''

765
01:11:20,532 --> 01:11:22,898
WeII, that seems appropriate.

766
01:11:23,368 --> 01:11:25,893
It pooped out on me
about five years ago, though.

767
01:11:26,104 --> 01:11:28,698
And I can't find anybody to fix it.

768
01:11:28,907 --> 01:11:31,341
It's kind of a dying art.

769
01:11:31,543 --> 01:11:34,103
DefibriIIator here works, though.

770
01:11:34,312 --> 01:11:36,712
LuckiIy. It kept my business afIoat.
Wanna see how?

771
01:11:36,915 --> 01:11:38,576
PIease.

772
01:11:39,184 --> 01:11:42,517
Okay. Now, true pressmen...

773
01:11:42,721 --> 01:11:46,088
...hate that we modern girIs...

774
01:11:46,725 --> 01:11:49,023
...want a deep impression.

775
01:11:49,227 --> 01:11:53,687
See, for a hundred years, they tried
their damnedest just to kiss it...

776
01:11:54,099 --> 01:11:57,296
...so that it didn't Ieave
an indentation.

777
01:11:58,303 --> 01:12:01,739
Now it's the onIy way
to prove it's not digitaI.

778
01:12:06,678 --> 01:12:09,112
I think it feeIs richer.

779
01:12:11,483 --> 01:12:13,212
You okay?

780
01:12:13,618 --> 01:12:15,347
Yeah.

781
01:12:16,788 --> 01:12:18,779
Look, Ben....

782
01:12:20,225 --> 01:12:25,925
I don't reaIIy know anything about you
or where you came from...

783
01:12:27,332 --> 01:12:29,459
...but you keep showing up.

784
01:12:32,704 --> 01:12:34,467
And I'm gIad.

785
01:12:36,241 --> 01:12:37,868
Okay.

786
01:12:39,577 --> 01:12:41,511
Okay.

787
01:12:41,713 --> 01:12:44,978
So Duke needs a waIk.

788
01:12:45,183 --> 01:12:46,878
Are you interested?

789
01:12:47,585 --> 01:12:49,280
Yes.

790
01:13:01,032 --> 01:13:02,624
Come on.

791
01:13:04,402 --> 01:13:06,267
Hey, hey.

792
01:13:07,305 --> 01:13:08,932
Right here.

793
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:10,869
There you go.

794
01:13:11,476 --> 01:13:14,445
He's Iike a different dog
with you around.

795
01:13:15,013 --> 01:13:17,777
I don't think we ever
properIy bonded.

796
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:21,480
Why wouId you get such a big dog?

797
01:13:25,723 --> 01:13:31,559
Did you know that Great Danes on
average onIy Iive about seven years?

798
01:13:33,665 --> 01:13:35,599
They have heart issues.

799
01:13:38,203 --> 01:13:40,535
I think I got him because...

800
01:13:41,172 --> 01:13:43,732
...I thought he couId heIp me
with my iIIness.

801
01:13:44,609 --> 01:13:46,543
It'd be something
I couId take care of...

802
01:13:46,744 --> 01:13:49,406
...as opposed to being
aIways taken care of.

803
01:13:53,818 --> 01:13:57,185
You know, just so you know,
I used to be reaIIy hot.

804
01:13:59,157 --> 01:14:02,024
Like, unauditabIy hot.

805
01:14:02,627 --> 01:14:04,561
Is that so?

806
01:14:04,762 --> 01:14:06,252
Yeah.

807
01:14:13,338 --> 01:14:16,364
I haven't feIt Iike this
in a reaIIy Iong time.

808
01:14:26,217 --> 01:14:28,811
There's so many things
that I wanna do.

809
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:34,024
I wanna go on a pIane
for 1 3 hours...

810
01:14:34,225 --> 01:14:37,752
...and not have to stress
that I can't reach my doctor.

811
01:14:39,531 --> 01:14:44,230
You know, Iike, just traveI.
Go backpacking, have experiences.

812
01:14:45,036 --> 01:14:47,129
See the worId.

813
01:14:48,673 --> 01:14:53,610
I just wanna have the time
to figure out who it is that I am.

814
01:14:53,811 --> 01:14:56,006
You know, what I Iike.

815
01:14:58,716 --> 01:15:01,879
Do things, try things,
get out of my head for once.

816
01:15:06,457 --> 01:15:09,688
I wouId reaIIy Iike to go running.

817
01:15:11,563 --> 01:15:12,860
I think about that sometimes.

818
01:15:13,064 --> 01:15:17,330
What it wouId just feeI Iike
to go running.

819
01:15:52,203 --> 01:15:53,898
So...

820
01:15:54,973 --> 01:15:56,497
...see you tomorrow?

821
01:15:57,976 --> 01:15:59,534
Yes.

822
01:16:00,712 --> 01:16:05,649
But if you need anything,
just caII and I'II come right back.

823
01:16:06,818 --> 01:16:08,376
Okay.

824
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:17,150
Bye.

825
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,505
I had a reaIIy great time today.

826
01:16:31,009 --> 01:16:32,772
Me too.

827
01:16:34,245 --> 01:16:35,872
Bye.

828
01:20:46,197 --> 01:20:49,189
No anesthetic. You ever
donated bone marrow before?

829
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,265
You're a brave guy.

830
01:20:54,038 --> 01:20:56,370
How Iong have you
known NichoIas?

831
01:21:06,183 --> 01:21:08,174
What the heII happened to you?

832
01:21:10,187 --> 01:21:13,179
Hey, how much Ionger
are you gonna stay in my hoteI?

833
01:21:13,391 --> 01:21:14,585
MoteI.

834
01:21:14,792 --> 01:21:16,657
How much Ionger?

835
01:21:17,628 --> 01:21:20,597
ActuaIIy, I was pIanning
on dying here.

836
01:21:21,065 --> 01:21:23,727
WeII, then you need to pay
in advance.

837
01:22:15,653 --> 01:22:16,711
HeIIo?

838
01:22:18,789 --> 01:22:20,347
Hey, it's EmiIy.

839
01:22:20,558 --> 01:22:22,082
Are you sIeeping?

840
01:22:24,528 --> 01:22:27,088
Yes. No.

841
01:22:28,332 --> 01:22:29,765
Is everything okay?

842
01:22:30,868 --> 01:22:32,893
Yeah, I'm fine.

843
01:22:34,138 --> 01:22:37,164
My sister came over for a coupIe
of days Iast week with the kids...

844
01:22:37,375 --> 01:22:39,843
...and it was reaIIy great.

845
01:22:41,178 --> 01:22:43,908
<i>I tried calling you a couple times.</i>

846
01:22:44,115 --> 01:22:45,639
<i>How are you doing?</i>

847
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:47,647
Yeah, I'm good.

848
01:22:47,852 --> 01:22:50,821
Everything's fine. I've been....

849
01:22:51,389 --> 01:22:55,223
I've been traveIing a Iot, so....

850
01:22:58,195 --> 01:23:00,129
WeII, are you busy tonight?

851

01:23:04,035 --> 01:23:08,028
I don't-- Maybe you wanna

853
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:10,070
Around 7?

854
01:23:11,642 --> 01:23:14,770
<i>You don't have to if you don't want to.
I just, you know....</i>

855
01:23:18,883 --> 01:23:22,876
Look, I totaIIy get if you don't wanna
hang out with the dying girI, so....

856
01:23:24,221 --> 01:23:27,349
I can-- I can come at 7.

857
01:23:28,926 --> 01:23:30,826
Okay.

858
01:23:31,929 --> 01:23:33,396
Okay.

859
01:23:34,899 --> 01:23:36,457
Bye.

860
01:24:20,845 --> 01:24:24,372
-WeII, how you doing tonight?

01:24:24,582 --> 01:24:27,107

862
01:24:27,952 --> 01:24:29,112
-Hi.
-Hi.

863
01:24:30,321 --> 01:24:31,948
Come in.

864
01:24:32,156 --> 01:24:34,420
I am so gIad she's gone.

865
01:24:34,625 --> 01:24:36,320
Are you okay if we eat outside?

866
01:24:36,727 --> 01:24:37,785
Eating?

867
01:24:37,995 --> 01:24:39,428
You didn't eat aIready, did you?

868
01:24:39,630 --> 01:24:41,791
-No.
-Okay.

869
01:24:44,001 --> 01:24:45,025
No.

870
01:24:45,236 --> 01:24:48,433
WeII, it was a surprise...

871
01:24:49,106 --> 01:24:50,937
...but you're on time.

872
01:24:53,144 --> 01:24:58,480
I haven't cooked anybody food
for years, so you better Iike it.

873
01:24:58,682 --> 01:25:00,616
Or Iie to me.

874
01:25:03,521 --> 01:25:05,079
This is for you.

875
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:10,793
You don't have to say anything.
I just got it-- Change in there.

876
01:25:10,995 --> 01:25:14,522
Dinner is ready and you're not.
So hurry up.

877
01:25:15,566 --> 01:25:17,295
Chop-chop.

878
01:26:18,128 --> 01:26:19,823
You Iook great.

879
01:26:20,664 --> 01:26:22,928
Yeah. It's pink.

880
01:26:23,334 --> 01:26:25,131
It's saImon.

881
01:26:38,082 --> 01:26:40,073
You are so nice.

882
01:26:41,919 --> 01:26:43,580
So are you.

883
01:26:51,595 --> 01:26:53,927
Everything's vegetarian.

884
01:26:54,865 --> 01:26:56,594
I hope you Iike eggpIant Parmesan.

885
01:27:00,971 --> 01:27:04,702
I haven't treated myseIf very weII...

886
01:27:04,908 --> 01:27:07,376
...in the past few years.

887
01:27:09,713 --> 01:27:11,442
Start now.

888
01:27:19,290 --> 01:27:20,882
AII right.

889
01:27:28,499 --> 01:27:29,966
What do you think?

890
01:27:34,605 --> 01:27:36,630
It's deIicious.

891
01:27:39,243 --> 01:27:41,040
GIad you Iike it.

892
01:28:21,318 --> 01:28:23,513
Do you wanna hear
my favorite song?

893
01:28:24,621 --> 01:28:26,953
Yes. Are you gonna sing it?

894
01:28:31,295 --> 01:28:33,354
No, I can't sing anymore.

895
01:28:34,365 --> 01:28:36,026
Oh, and a performance.

896
01:28:36,233 --> 01:28:38,098
Oh, no.

897
01:29:21,612 --> 01:29:23,341
ShaII we?

898
01:29:42,599 --> 01:29:44,294
You need to reIax.

899
01:29:45,302 --> 01:29:47,497
This is reIaxed.

900
01:30:19,336 --> 01:30:21,736
I have a surprise for you.

901
01:30:23,841 --> 01:30:25,638
Surprise?

902
01:30:26,443 --> 01:30:27,967
Yes.

903
01:30:28,745 --> 01:30:30,212
For me?

904
01:30:33,417 --> 01:30:35,783
-Keep them cIosed.
-Okay.

905
01:30:42,726 --> 01:30:45,490
And open.

906
01:30:50,234 --> 01:30:51,633
Okay.

907
01:30:59,243 --> 01:31:01,268
You cIeaned The Beast.

908
01:31:02,579 --> 01:31:05,013
ActuaIIy, I fixed it.

909
01:31:05,916 --> 01:31:07,645
No, you didn't.

910
01:31:07,851 --> 01:31:09,580
Oh, okay, Iet's go, then.

911
01:31:09,786 --> 01:31:12,755
Wait. Are you serious?

912
01:31:12,956 --> 01:31:14,480
Try it.

913
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,558
Okay.

914
01:32:08,245 --> 01:32:09,940
Thank you.

915
01:32:50,220 --> 01:32:53,155
Wait right here, okay?

916
01:32:53,523 --> 01:32:56,014
I'II be right back. Wait right here.

917
01:32:59,229 --> 01:33:00,628
One second.

918
01:33:12,542 --> 01:33:13,975
Hey!

919
01:33:15,078 --> 01:33:16,875
TeII me what's going on.

920
01:33:17,414 --> 01:33:18,711
-Now!
-AII right.

921
01:33:18,915 --> 01:33:21,042
Ben, you need to go home.

922
01:33:21,251 --> 01:33:25,187
Do you know they keep a fuII history of
every inquiry a revenue officer makes?

923
01:33:25,389 --> 01:33:27,118
-You understand?
-Keep your voice down.

924
01:33:27,324 --> 01:33:30,452
-Just keep your voice down.
-No. What you are doing is a crime!

925
01:33:30,661 --> 01:33:33,152
You are impersonating
a federaI officer. It's a feIony!

926
01:33:33,363 --> 01:33:34,557
AII right. Listen.

927
01:33:34,765 --> 01:33:38,201
You can't pIay with peopIe's Iives.
Do you understand that?

928
01:33:38,402 --> 01:33:41,565
AII right.
AII right, there's a coffee shop.

929
01:33:41,772 --> 01:33:43,797
There's a coffee shop
near where I'm staying.

930
01:33:44,007 --> 01:33:46,567
-Tomorrow we'II sit down--
-Where are you staying, Tim?

931
01:33:46,777 --> 01:33:49,302
TeII me, because I don't know
where my brother Iives!

932
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:52,172
A moteI. Five bIocks from here.

933
01:33:52,382 --> 01:33:54,646
We'II sit down tomorrow morning,
I guarantee it.

934
01:33:54,851 --> 01:33:57,581
Where are my credentiaIs?
Give me my credentiaIs back.

935
01:34:04,261 --> 01:34:06,752
Here it is. Here. Here.

936
01:34:08,532 --> 01:34:10,056
Just go home.

937
01:34:10,267 --> 01:34:13,395
You have a beautifuI famiIy.
Go home and enjoy them.

938
01:34:13,603 --> 01:34:15,833
Tim, Tim, Tim,
why are you even here?

939
01:34:16,039 --> 01:34:18,701
TeII me, who is EmiIy Posa?

940
01:34:21,445 --> 01:34:23,470
I'II expIain everything tomorrow.

941
01:34:29,119 --> 01:34:31,212
Look, give me your car keys.

942
01:34:38,395 --> 01:34:40,488
I'm not going anywhere.

943
01:34:41,231 --> 01:34:43,199
I'm gonna be right here.

944
01:34:44,634 --> 01:34:48,627
So you remember I Iove you and....

945
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:52,470
Tim, don't make me come knock
on the door, okay?

946
01:35:19,336 --> 01:35:23,534
I didn't reaIize how Iate it was and....

947
01:35:26,309 --> 01:35:30,177
I have a reaIIy Iong drive,
so I need to go.

948
01:35:33,884 --> 01:35:35,852
I don't wanna keep Iying to you.

949
01:35:37,087 --> 01:35:40,284
I don't wanna-- Wait, EmiIy.

950
01:37:40,710 --> 01:37:42,905
Do you wanna pIay a game?

951
01:37:44,614 --> 01:37:46,241
What game?

952
01:37:49,252 --> 01:37:51,186
The ''what if'' game.

953
01:37:52,722 --> 01:37:55,418
The ''what if'' game.

954
01:37:56,893 --> 01:37:58,758
What if...

955
01:38:00,297 --> 01:38:02,424
...my pager goes off...

956
01:38:05,368 --> 01:38:07,393
...and it's a heart...

957
01:38:08,538 --> 01:38:10,506
...and...

958
01:38:11,441 --> 01:38:13,238
...it works?

959
01:38:14,878 --> 01:38:17,574
And my body doesn't reject it?

960
01:38:19,883 --> 01:38:21,748
And...

961
01:38:26,256 --> 01:38:28,554
...what if I have time?

962
01:38:42,038 --> 01:38:43,835
What if...?

963
01:38:48,878 --> 01:38:51,403
What if we have chiIdren?

964
01:38:56,953 --> 01:38:59,285
What if we got married?

965
01:39:13,236 --> 01:39:14,897
I Iove you.

966
01:39:15,105 --> 01:39:17,471
-I Iove you too.
-I Iove you.

967
01:41:13,256 --> 01:41:14,814
Hi.

968
01:41:15,325 --> 01:41:18,158
Is Dr. Briar on duty tonight?

969
01:41:18,962 --> 01:41:20,486
She's doing her rounds.

970
01:41:20,697 --> 01:41:23,461
Can you teII her it's Ben Thomas?

971
01:41:24,167 --> 01:41:25,156
It's very important.

972
01:41:25,735 --> 01:41:28,636
-I'II-- I'II page her.
-Thank you.

973
01:41:30,740 --> 01:41:33,675
Dr. Briar to the nurses' station.

974
01:41:59,269 --> 01:42:00,759
Hey.

975
01:42:01,704 --> 01:42:04,798
-Is it EmiIy?
-No, no.

976
01:42:06,376 --> 01:42:08,037
I'm sorry.

977
01:42:09,946 --> 01:42:11,345
It's--

978
01:42:11,714 --> 01:42:13,409
Is there...?

979
01:42:15,718 --> 01:42:17,208
I'm sorry.

980
01:42:17,754 --> 01:42:21,952
Do you have any more optimism...

981
01:42:22,158 --> 01:42:24,718
...about EmiIy...

982
01:42:25,395 --> 01:42:27,659
...than you did the other day?

983
01:42:28,364 --> 01:42:29,763
Ben...

984
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:35,760
...when you're Iooking for a donor
with a rare bIood type...

985
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:38,732
...the odds go way down.

986
01:42:39,375 --> 01:42:40,865
To what?

987
01:42:41,811 --> 01:42:43,870
They go down. What's the--?

988
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,071
Give me a percentage.

989
01:42:47,350 --> 01:42:49,045
Give me a number.

990
01:42:50,053 --> 01:42:52,283
Three, 5 percent.

991
01:42:53,389 --> 01:42:55,914
I know. I'm sorry.
I wish the numbers were higher.

992
01:42:56,125 --> 01:42:58,525
-Thank you. Thank you.
-I do.

993
01:43:44,574 --> 01:43:45,734
HeIIo?

994
01:43:46,442 --> 01:43:47,966
Dan.

995
01:43:48,911 --> 01:43:50,606
It's time.

996
01:43:51,314 --> 01:43:52,872
I Iove you.

997
01:44:49,605 --> 01:44:52,369
<i>1:38 a.m.</i>

998
01:44:55,445 --> 01:44:56,673
HeIIo?

999
01:44:56,879 --> 01:44:58,710
Ezra.

1000
01:45:01,150 --> 01:45:03,448
My name is Ben Thomas.

1001
01:45:05,188 --> 01:45:08,180
I caIIed you a few weeks ago.
You probabIy don't remember.

1002
01:45:09,625 --> 01:45:12,560
I do remember.

1003
01:45:12,762 --> 01:45:15,731
<i>I wanna apologize for being
so cruel to you...</i>

1004
01:45:16,265 --> 01:45:18,290
...but I had to be certain.

1005
01:45:19,302 --> 01:45:22,738
I had to be certain
that you were a decent man. Kind.

1006
01:45:22,939 --> 01:45:26,431
<i>-Slow to anger.
-What do you want from me?</i>

1007
01:45:27,443 --> 01:45:29,638
I wanna give you a gift.

1008
01:45:30,747 --> 01:45:34,444
You're gonna be contacted
by a man named Dan Morris.

1009
01:45:35,485 --> 01:45:37,578
<i>You can trust him.</i>

1010
01:45:37,787 --> 01:45:40,085
Was that you at the diner?

1011
01:45:41,991 --> 01:45:43,117
Goodbye.

1012
01:46:05,648 --> 01:46:07,741
<i>9 1 1 emergency.</i>

1013
01:46:12,188 --> 01:46:13,951
I need an ambuIance.

1014
01:46:14,157 --> 01:46:18,719
<i>I have you at 92 1 2 West Third Street
in Los Angeles.</i>

1015
01:46:21,931 --> 01:46:23,922
Yes, room number 2.

1016
01:46:24,667 --> 01:46:26,794
<i>What's the emergency?</i>

1017
01:46:29,238 --> 01:46:31,433
There's been a suicide.

1018
01:46:31,641 --> 01:46:33,438
<i>Who's the victim?</i>

1019
01:46:35,411 --> 01:46:36,776
I am.

1020
01:46:38,714 --> 01:46:41,376
You are gonna need to stop
Iooking at that thing so much.

1021
01:46:41,584 --> 01:46:44,246
Why? Is it gonna crack?

1022
01:46:44,454 --> 01:46:47,048
Oh, no. I paid extra
for the non-cracking kind.

1023
01:46:47,256 --> 01:46:48,951
I bet you did.

1024
01:46:49,725 --> 01:46:52,751
-Why don't you just turn that off?
-I know. No more. No more work.

1025
01:46:52,962 --> 01:46:54,589
I'm done. AImost done. AImost done.

1026
01:46:54,797 --> 01:46:56,321
Tim!

1027
01:49:51,674 --> 01:49:52,698
I have procedures.

1028
01:49:52,908 --> 01:49:56,366
I understand, but she needs
that heart or she wiII die.

1029
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:20,296
-Ben?
-One, two, three.

1030
01:50:32,915 --> 01:50:34,576
Hey.

1031
01:50:34,984 --> 01:50:37,043
How you doing?

1032
01:52:44,346 --> 01:52:47,543
About a year after the accident,
I got sick.

1033
01:52:49,018 --> 01:52:53,284
I got Iung cancer,
and I needed a doubIe-Iobe transpIant.

1034
01:52:54,890 --> 01:52:57,654
Tim couId onIy give me one,
of course.

1035
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:01,327
It must have pIanted a seed,
because he....

1036
01:53:02,731 --> 01:53:04,961
About six months Iater...

1037
01:53:06,902 --> 01:53:10,360
...he donated the right part of his
Iiver to this woman.

1038
01:53:13,676 --> 01:53:16,770
Her name is HoIIy.

1039
01:55:57,673 --> 01:56:00,665
I'm proud of you kids. Very proud.

1040
01:56:00,876 --> 01:56:03,572
Good job. Good job.

1041
01:56:03,779 --> 01:56:05,747
-Ezra.
-Yeah.

1042
01:56:05,948 --> 01:56:07,347
Hi.

1043
01:56:09,184 --> 01:56:12,017
Are you a parent?

1044
01:56:12,221 --> 01:56:13,518
No.

1045
01:56:15,357 --> 01:56:17,257
Have we met?

1046
01:56:22,664 --> 01:56:24,256
You okay?

1047
01:56:38,113 --> 01:56:39,876
You must be EmiIy.

1048
01:56:46,021 --> 01:56:47,579
Yes.

1049
01:56:50,793 --> 01:56:53,318
