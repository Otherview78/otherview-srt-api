1
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,950
Stay down!

2
00:00:43,194 --> 00:00:44,397
Don't move!

3
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:50,628
Yeah!

4
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,276
Mayday! Mayday! This is the Sawyer-Two.

5
00:00:59,412 --> 00:01:01,146
We're under attack by pirates.

6
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:02,877
Requesting an immediate aid.

7
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:09,681
They say everybody's good at something.

8
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:11,853
Me? I talk to fish.

9
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,452
That's how I met my friend, Storm.

10
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:19,194
He's always there when I need a lift.

11
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:32,940
Some people think that makes me a joke.

12
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:34,745
But I don't care. You know why?

13
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,443
'Cause I'm also good at something else.

14
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,486
And that's breaking heads.

15
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:51,326
Pow! Papa took on all the pirates.

16
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:54,244
I was like, "Well, the pirates think that.."

17
00:01:54,268 --> 00:01:55,924
Hi-ya!

18
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,131
Papa kicked their butts.

19
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:04,153
Those chum lickers didn't stand a chance.

20
00:02:04,177 --> 00:02:06,106
Ooh!

21
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:08,312
Papa kicked their asses and took their names.

22
00:02:08,448 --> 00:02:10,582
Yeah! Come on!

23
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,140
Watch out.

24
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:21,650
Sorry, Pops. My bad.

25
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:24,861
Oh, yeah, this is my son, Arthur Jr.

26
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:27,427
See, four years ago, everything changed.

27
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:30,999
I met a woman, fell in love, and the next thing I know,

28
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:32,610
we're getting married and having a kid.

29
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,905
This little guy's the best thing that ever happened to me.

30
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:43,549
But this kid, he doesn't sleep.

31
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:46,684
What you got in there, huh?

32
00:02:48,011 --> 00:02:49,350
Okay..

33
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,929
And he never misses.

34
00:02:51,953 --> 00:02:53,318
What the...

35
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:55,257
And then, I'm up at the crack of dawn

36
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:57,201
because on top of getting married and having a kid...

37
00:02:57,225 --> 00:03:00,494
...I finally got a job.

38
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:03,730
That's right. I'm the king of freaking Atlantis.

39
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:08,903
How did I score that, you asked?

40
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:10,740
Well, I stopped my brother, Orm,

41
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,305
from attacking the surface world.

42
00:03:13,441 --> 00:03:16,241
And in doing so, I claimed the throne from him.

43
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,647
At first I was all like...

44
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,116
Yeah!

45
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:23,261
The territorial waters are long held...

46
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:24,954
But then, as it turned out,

47
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,631
being king wasn't all it was cracked up to be.

48
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,922
It's just meetings all day and politics.

49
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:33,337
I'm so bored, I don't even know which end of the Brine King

50
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:35,097
I'm supposed to be looking at half the time.

51
00:03:37,103 --> 00:03:38,202
Whoo!

52
00:03:38,338 --> 00:03:39,671
Yeah! That was awesome!

53
00:03:39,806 --> 00:03:41,326
And if that's not bad enough,

54
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:43,638
turns out there's this whole Council of Houses thing

55
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:45,473
that nobody told me about.

56
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:48,373
Which basically gets to shoot down everything I want to do.

57
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:50,188
The only thing that makes all the hard work

58
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:53,285
and sleepless nights worthwhile is hanging with my little man.

59
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,251
Hey! You missed me!

60
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:02,237
But of course, there are fun parts of the job.

61
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,231
Whoa!

62
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:07,939
I get to keep the sea safe the best way I know how.

63
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:15,069
Especially when I get to take down an illegal cage fight or two.

64
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:22,842
But for everything I get right,

65
00:04:22,977 --> 00:04:24,776
something else gets screwed up.

66
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:35,921
Ah, fu..

67
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:46,705
♪ Born to be wild ♪

68
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:04,085
- Oh, yeah. - Here you go.

69
00:05:09,328 --> 00:05:10,795
Slainte.

70
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:18,201
So...

71
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:21,238
he's gonna need a little brother or sister to play with.

72
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,377
He's got a dog.

73
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:30,045
Hey, I'm serious.

74
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,382
I saw how lonely it was for you growing up.

75
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:34,984
An only child.

76
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:39,384
I always regretted I couldn't give you that.

77
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,818
Yeah, well, don't be too hard on yourself.

78
00:05:42,953 --> 00:05:45,458
Turns out I have a brother and he's a total dick bag.

79
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:46,931
Come on.

80
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:51,097
Your relationship with Orm isn't how it usually is.

81
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:54,805
Sure, siblings bicker and fight...

82
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:58,238
but at the end of the day, they're family.

83
00:05:58,374 --> 00:06:02,112
You should be able to count on them for help.

84
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:05,711
Yeah, well, I'll still take the dog over him any day.

85
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:13,825
Hey, look at that.

86
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:25,738
Holy crap.

87
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,506
Hi, baby boy. Are you talking to the fishies?

88
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:42,682
Oh, man. Pops, this is blowing my mind.

89
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:46,021
My whole life I've wanted to share this gift with someone.

90
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:49,289
Yeah, but you and me, son, we're different.

91
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,059
We're special.

92
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:54,157
We're connected to the land and the sea.

93
00:06:54,293 --> 00:06:59,100
I can't wait to introduce you to all the majestic creatures on our planet.

94
00:06:59,236 --> 00:07:02,472
And show you how awesome this world can be.

95
00:07:02,607 --> 00:07:03,941
Yeah, you and me.

96
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:02,199
I cross-referenced the coordinates from Dr. Shin.

97
00:08:02,335 --> 00:08:03,662
Nothing.

98
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:06,103
Still no sign of Atlantean remnants under the ice.

99
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:08,841
Looks like he's led us on another wild goose chase.

100
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:28,255
Every day I don't fix my power suit

101
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,391
is another day Aquaman gets to live.

102
00:08:35,468 --> 00:08:37,264
Check again.

103
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:40,136
We're close this time. I can feel it.

104
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:51,745
Expedition log day 463, Dr. Stephen Shin recording.

105
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:55,446
My quest for Atlantis has brought me to the ends of the earth.

106
00:08:55,581 --> 00:08:58,423
David Kane is losing his patience.

107
00:08:58,558 --> 00:09:02,090
If I don't turn up the Atlantean technology he's looking for soon,

108
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:05,656
they're probably going to... um...

109
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,439
You know what, let's not even go there.

110
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:10,964
I'm sure everything will be fine.

111
00:09:22,915 --> 00:09:25,278
Dr. Shin, take a look at this.

112
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:27,850
Please tell me you found something.

113
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:29,752
Seismic array is going crazy.

114
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:31,286
Where's the epicenter?

115
00:09:32,054 --> 00:09:33,255
We're standing on it.

116
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:58,115
Run!

117
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:48,431
What just happened? An earthquake?

118
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:52,004
No. I think it was a piece of ice sheet breaking off.

119
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:31,208
Come on. Get up.

120
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,180
- I think I broke my ankle! - Come on. Let's go!

121
00:11:35,315 --> 00:11:37,676
Come on, get up. Go, we gotta go! We gotta go!

122
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:41,812
Come on, we gotta move! Come on!

123
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,704
Please, please. No, no! Help, please! Don't let go!

124
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:38,440
What the hell happened to you?

125
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,872
There's something back there.

126
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:58,458
Astounding.

127
00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:00,595
My readings show something's down here.

128
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:03,395
And it's definitely big enough to be an Atlantean ship.

129
00:13:03,531 --> 00:13:07,732
If it is, we might be able to scavenge the tech you need to fix your suit.

130
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:10,768
How is this place even possible?

131
00:13:10,904 --> 00:13:12,386
This was all probably solid ice

132
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,511
until we started heating the planet.

133
00:13:15,646 --> 00:13:18,714
Well, thank God for global warming, am I right?

134
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,253
Uh, yeah, that's not exactly a good thing.

135
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:41,668
The tracks lead down there.

136
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,870
Suit up.

137
00:13:45,005 --> 00:13:49,011
Wait. The tracks lead down there, which means...

138
00:13:49,147 --> 00:13:51,183
the monster's down there.

139
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,784
Okay. I guess we're going down there.

140
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:25,646
I don't believe this.

141
00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:30,088
It's a structure of some kind.

142
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:32,720
And there's more buried in the ice.

143
00:14:32,855 --> 00:14:35,924
Here I thought we were just going to find a ship.

144
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:39,594
- Everyone, fan out and search. - Yes, Sir.

145
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:42,795
We've stumbled upon something big here, doc.

146
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,739
This has to be a few thousand years old.

147
00:14:48,874 --> 00:14:50,473
Astounding.

148
00:14:56,848 --> 00:14:58,316
Whoa.

149
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:00,351
Uh...

150
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:41,925
Ow...

151
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:00,442
What is this place?

152
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:07,748
At last, you are here.

153
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:39,316
Free me from my prison

154
00:16:39,452 --> 00:16:42,454
and I will grant you the strength

155
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:46,288
to kill the man who murdered your father.

156
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:48,091
You can't leave him like this!

157
00:16:48,227 --> 00:16:50,018
You ask the sea for mercy.

158
00:16:50,153 --> 00:16:51,823
Get out of here! You need to live

159
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,293
so you can kill that son of a bitch!

160
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:58,801
You will take from him what he stole from you.

161
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:03,674
His home will burn

162
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:08,974
and his kingdom will fall before my legions.

163
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:16,481
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

164
00:17:16,616 --> 00:17:18,021
David. No, David.

165
00:17:18,157 --> 00:17:19,517
David! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

166
00:17:19,653 --> 00:17:22,025
David. David, it's okay.

167
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,527
You're all right.

168
00:17:25,154 --> 00:17:26,596
What the hell is that thing?

169
00:17:41,274 --> 00:17:42,889
...Just unbelievable footage

170
00:17:42,913 --> 00:17:44,708
coming in from all around the world.

171
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:46,944
Good evening, folks.

172
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,595
In the past five months, we've seen an extraordinary rise in temperatures

173
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:51,518
reported around the world.

174
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:55,219
And that has resulted in some of the wildest weather we've ever seen.

175
00:17:55,355 --> 00:17:58,894
Yes, this is thundersnow in Dallas, Texas.

176
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:00,841
Visibility is near zero...

177
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:02,765
...and there's more snow expected tonight

178
00:18:02,901 --> 00:18:06,000
than Dallas usually sees in an entire year.

179
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:08,935
It's only one part of a worldwide weather phenomenon

180
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,572
unlike anything we've ever seen before.

181
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:18,773
Arthur.

182
00:18:21,952 --> 00:18:24,652
The Council's called for an emergency gathering.

183
00:18:24,788 --> 00:18:28,055
There's been another plague outbreak.

184
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:31,459
...scientists are at a loss to explain.

185
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:33,494
But the real question is,

186
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,995
how long will it continue?

187
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,766
And how much hotter is it going to get?

188
00:18:40,464 --> 00:18:42,771
Where did it hit this time?

189
00:18:42,906 --> 00:18:44,904
The Ninth Tride of Atlantis,

190
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,739
and there are now reports of outbreaks

191
00:18:46,874 --> 00:18:49,009
in the Fishermen Kingdom as well.

192
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:52,046
There haven't been outbreaks like this in centuries.

193
00:18:52,182 --> 00:18:53,875
Why now?

194
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,317
Increased ocean acidity, decreased oxygen levels, toxic algal blooms.

195
00:18:57,452 --> 00:18:59,155
Take your pick.

196
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:04,685
The surface has been poisoning our atmosphere for over a century.

197
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:06,805
You can't expect them to care about what happens to us

198
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:09,424
if they don't even know we exist.

199
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,074
If you want to be a part of the conversation,

200
00:19:11,098 --> 00:19:13,703
we have to take our seat at the table.

201
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:21,608
It's time for Atlantis to reveal itself to the surface.

202
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:28,784
Your majesty is well aware of the Council's position on this.

203
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,882
Listen, we can talk to their scientists

204
00:19:31,017 --> 00:19:35,053
and combine our technologies to reverse the damage that they've already done.

205
00:19:35,189 --> 00:19:37,855
And I know this is against our traditions,

206
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,389
but the world is shrinking,

207
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:41,962
and the old ways aren't gonna protect us anymore.

208
00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:44,635
Times have changed.

209
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,933
Atlantis wants this.

210
00:19:47,068 --> 00:19:48,468
There's a whole generation out there

211
00:19:48,508 --> 00:19:49,903
that don't want to hide anymore.

212
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:53,377
Have you already forgotten that this plague

213
00:19:53,512 --> 00:19:56,371
killed your own beloved mentor,

214
00:19:56,506 --> 00:19:59,612
and you want to negotiate with them?

215
00:19:59,748 --> 00:20:04,681
We gave your brother war powers and made him Ocean Master for a reason.

216
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:08,990
If we ever decide to make ourselves known to the surface-dwellers,

217
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:13,257
it will be to eradicate them, not to co-exist.

218
00:20:41,723 --> 00:20:43,760
Hey, not bad.

219
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:48,094
Used to take me twice as long to get you to go to sleep.

220
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,964
I don't know how you did it, Pops.

221
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:52,100
Mera and I have the whole kingdom helping us,

222
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:54,599
but that little baby boy is still kicking our asses.

223
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:57,037
And you...

224
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:00,678
taking care of me, raising me on your own...

225
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:06,981
You're the real superhero.

226
00:21:09,753 --> 00:21:12,118
- To single parents. - Mmm.

227
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:17,222
Well, my job was a little less stressful than yours.

228
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:20,832
Yeah, well, I just plain suck at my job.

229
00:21:20,967 --> 00:21:24,332
Vulko told me to bring the land and the sea together.

230
00:21:24,468 --> 00:21:28,938
The problem is half of Atlantis still wants to destroy the surface.

231
00:21:29,073 --> 00:21:31,441
They won't listen. I can't bring shit together.

232
00:21:31,576 --> 00:21:34,538
Vulko believed in you. Aye.

233
00:21:34,674 --> 00:21:36,109
I know.

234
00:21:38,349 --> 00:21:39,750
I miss him.

235
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:43,919
Hey.

236
00:21:45,723 --> 00:21:48,420
You can't save them all, son.

237
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:52,697
You really want to know how I raised you here by myself?

238
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:56,701
I just kept going.

239
00:21:56,836 --> 00:21:59,969
You celebrate the wins, you mourn the losses.

240
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:02,635
And you wake up the next day and you do it again.

241
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:04,740
Sometimes not giving up

242
00:22:04,876 --> 00:22:07,404
is the most heroic thing you can do.

243
00:23:06,235 --> 00:23:08,971
Humans were not made to live at these depths.

244
00:23:09,873 --> 00:23:11,973
Yeah, don't worry about that.

245
00:23:12,109 --> 00:23:14,846
You just remember who built this ship.

246
00:23:14,981 --> 00:23:17,445
I'm more worried about how long ago they built it.

247
00:23:18,984 --> 00:23:22,281
We're coming up on it. Engage stealth mode.

248
00:23:38,932 --> 00:23:41,366
Hey, doc.

249
00:23:41,501 --> 00:23:44,171
You stand ready with that big gun of yours.

250
00:23:54,487 --> 00:23:57,480
Expedition log, day 613.

251
00:23:57,616 --> 00:24:00,188
Kane is off on our most dangerous mission yet.

252
00:24:00,323 --> 00:24:03,322
A three man octobot infiltration team.

253
00:24:06,094 --> 00:24:07,766
It's incredible that these ancient machines we found

254
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,923
still function after all these years.

255
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:11,963
All I did was retrofit them to our needs.

256
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:16,507
But they require a very specialized fuel to keep them running.

257
00:24:16,643 --> 00:24:18,535
Kane calls it orichalcum.

258
00:24:18,671 --> 00:24:20,407
I don't know how he knows about this,

259
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,181
but it all started the day he found that trident.

260
00:24:23,316 --> 00:24:26,182
Suddenly, he knows secrets that he couldn't possibly know,

261
00:24:26,317 --> 00:24:28,912
including the only way to obtain this orichalcum

262
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:32,190
is to steal it from highly-protected storage vaults.

263
00:24:32,325 --> 00:24:35,288
And we're about to hit the most dangerous one of them all.

264
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:23,941
Okay, you have 15 minutes to get in and out.

265
00:25:25,007 --> 00:25:26,977
No margin for error.

266
00:25:40,687 --> 00:25:43,257
Yeah, this should take you through.

267
00:25:56,976 --> 00:25:58,471
We don't want any confrontation.

268
00:25:58,606 --> 00:26:01,407
David, we can't fight their entire army.

269
00:26:18,027 --> 00:26:19,861
Stay vigilant.

270
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:22,676
We have no idea what kind of security measures they have down there.

271
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:50,689
Commencing extraction.

272
00:26:50,824 --> 00:26:53,558
Be careful. It's highly volatile.

273
00:27:01,301 --> 00:27:03,040
Loading barge now.

274
00:27:20,826 --> 00:27:23,825
Stingray, change of plans.

275
00:27:23,961 --> 00:27:25,425
I need an extraction now!

276
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,159
All hands to battle stations.

277
00:28:02,658 --> 00:28:04,134
Astounding.

278
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,600
Attention, unidentified vessel.

279
00:28:10,736 --> 00:28:12,206
You are out of the transit zone.

280
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:14,644
Doctor, power up the sonic battery.

281
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:17,976
Illegal border crossing will be met with deadly force.

282
00:28:18,111 --> 00:28:18,912
Now!

283
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:23,087
Commencing charge.

284
00:28:29,262 --> 00:28:31,961
Border Control, intruder approaching.

285
00:28:32,096 --> 00:28:34,026
Arm hydro cannon and lock target.

286
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:36,627
Hydro cannon at front border gate locking in on target.

287
00:28:36,763 --> 00:28:38,498
Chargers set to maximum power.

288
00:28:41,906 --> 00:28:42,906
Intruder in sight.

289
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,471
Take them out!

290
00:28:48,675 --> 00:28:52,149
What are you waiting for? Fire!

291
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:25,746
Sir, Atlantean hostiles are approaching.

292
00:29:25,882 --> 00:29:28,082
Split up. Make your way to the extraction point.

293
00:29:28,148 --> 00:29:29,384
Roger.

294
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:31,079
They've raided the storage vault.

295
00:29:31,154 --> 00:29:32,286
We can't let them get away.

296
00:29:32,422 --> 00:29:35,456
Don't worry, they won't. I'm on this one.

297
00:29:49,741 --> 00:29:50,767
Hold your fire!

298
00:29:50,903 --> 00:29:52,733
They're cutting through the Night Market.

299
00:29:52,868 --> 00:29:54,805
Watch out for the civilians.

300
00:30:49,092 --> 00:30:50,957
Warning. Warning.

301
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:52,762
Illegal entrance into hypertube.

302
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:55,729
Exceeding maximum speed of 600 knots.

303
00:30:55,865 --> 00:30:57,708
Reduce speed immediately.

304
00:31:43,922 --> 00:31:44,922
Oh, shit.

305
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,677
David, we're here at the extraction point.

306
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:06,106
The orichalcum is onboard and secure. Come on, let's go!

307
00:32:06,242 --> 00:32:07,342
Not yet!

308
00:32:07,477 --> 00:32:10,314
I'm gonna kill me a dead mermaid.

309
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,723
Get away from my wife!

310
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,625
Your wife?

311
00:32:26,761 --> 00:32:29,097
First you steal your brother's throne,

312
00:32:29,233 --> 00:32:31,033
then you steal his woman?

313
00:32:31,168 --> 00:32:34,494
Aquaman, shame on you.

314
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,710
Uh, David, we gotta go.

315
00:32:42,845 --> 00:32:44,874
The entire Atlantean army is headed this way.

316
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:47,351
If we don't leave now, we're dead.

317
00:33:34,827 --> 00:33:36,796
Twenty degrees port!

318
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:54,682
Fire the sonic cannon!

319
00:33:55,251 --> 00:33:56,552
Come on, Shin!

320
00:34:10,062 --> 00:34:11,634
Lady Karshon has called

321
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:13,797
an emergency session of the High Council

322
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:17,333
to discuss a motion that would strip the throne of its executive power.

323
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:22,069
The throne is the heart of Atlantis.

324
00:34:22,204 --> 00:34:24,571
Too often now it stands empty,

325
00:34:24,706 --> 00:34:28,117
while our king spends half his time on land.

326
00:34:28,252 --> 00:34:32,817
And now his surface world enemies have followed him home.

327
00:34:32,953 --> 00:34:35,624
This tragedy is merely a taste

328
00:34:35,759 --> 00:34:37,924
of the havoc that will be wrought,

329
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,731
if Atlantis ever becomes known to the surface.

330
00:34:41,866 --> 00:34:45,402
Because if he cannot protect his own family,

331
00:34:45,537 --> 00:34:48,835
how is he supposed to protect us?

332
00:34:55,714 --> 00:34:59,109
He's different now. He's stronger than before.

333
00:34:59,244 --> 00:35:01,145
And he can fight me without the power suit.

334
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,615
And where the hell did he get all the new toys from?

335
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:05,015
The technology seems ancient,

336
00:35:05,151 --> 00:35:07,284
but we've never seen anything like it.

337
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,493
That weapon he used fires some kind of ultrasonic energy

338
00:35:11,629 --> 00:35:13,328
that disrupts the nervous system.

339
00:35:13,463 --> 00:35:14,762
Do we know what was stolen?

340
00:35:14,898 --> 00:35:19,162
He escaped with a large stockpile of orichalcum.

341
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,266
Am I supposed to know what that is?

342
00:35:22,402 --> 00:35:25,741
Orichalcum is a power source that was used in ancient times.

343
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:28,478
It emits tremendous amounts of greenhouse gases

344
00:35:28,614 --> 00:35:30,252
that are highly destructive to our planet.

345
00:35:30,276 --> 00:35:33,043
In fact, we almost destroyed the oceans ourselves

346
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:35,818
before we realized what we were doing.

347
00:35:35,954 --> 00:35:39,317
It can't be disposed of safely, so the remaining stockpile

348
00:35:39,452 --> 00:35:43,023
has been buried in 12 storage vaults deep underground.

349
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:45,034
We should warn the other places that are storing the stuff.

350
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:47,729
He's already been there. It's all gone.

351
00:35:47,864 --> 00:35:49,693
We think he's been launching secret raids

352
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:51,599
for at least five months.

353
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:53,135
This is just the time he got caught.

354
00:35:53,198 --> 00:35:54,734
Well, this spike in global temperatures

355
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,566
that's causing disasters on the surface

356
00:35:56,702 --> 00:36:01,438
and making the sea dwellers sick happened five months ago.

357
00:36:01,574 --> 00:36:05,076
He's using the stolen orichalcum to heat the planet.

358
00:36:06,746 --> 00:36:08,651
Why would he do that?

359
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:10,649
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

360
00:36:10,785 --> 00:36:14,084
If he is using the orichalcum to heat the planet, we don't have much time.

361
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,190
He is pushing this past the tipping point.

362
00:36:16,326 --> 00:36:20,725
He must be stopped or a global climate meltdown is imminent.

363
00:36:20,861 --> 00:36:22,159
We need to find him,

364
00:36:22,294 --> 00:36:23,974
but he's completely vanished off the radar.

365
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:26,603
I think I know someone who might be able to help us.

366
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,166
But you're not gonna like it.

367
00:36:30,703 --> 00:36:32,405
Your brother?

368
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,821
Believe me, he's the last person I wanna go begging for help,

369
00:36:34,845 --> 00:36:36,572
but he's dealt with Manta in the past,

370
00:36:36,707 --> 00:36:38,991
and he's the only one who might know how to find him in time.

371
00:36:39,015 --> 00:36:42,680
The Fishermen will never allow you to speak to Orm.

372
00:36:42,815 --> 00:36:44,819
He killed their king.

373
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:47,186
I wasn't exactly gonna ask for permission.

374
00:36:47,322 --> 00:36:51,755
Arthur, Atlantis cannot extract Orm from an allied nation.

375
00:36:51,891 --> 00:36:54,257
It would be an act of war.

376
00:36:55,565 --> 00:36:57,293
Atlantis isn't gonna do it.

377
00:36:58,437 --> 00:37:00,168
I'm gonna break him out myself.

378
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:03,863
Arthur, Karshon is looking for a reason to seize war powers.

379
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:06,676
You will be nothing more than a figurehead if she does that.

380
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:08,183
My place is out there where I belong,

381
00:37:08,207 --> 00:37:09,647
where I'm actually good at what I do.

382
00:37:09,748 --> 00:37:12,011
I'm tired of nothing ever getting done.

383
00:37:12,746 --> 00:37:14,211
I've got to do this.

384
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:19,082
If anyone finds out, if you're caught...

385
00:37:19,218 --> 00:37:21,658
it will tear the kingdoms apart.

386
00:37:23,021 --> 00:37:25,861
Then help me not get caught.

387
00:37:30,068 --> 00:37:32,101
Xebelian intelligence has recently learned

388
00:37:32,236 --> 00:37:34,101
that your brother is being held on the surface

389
00:37:34,237 --> 00:37:36,704
in a secret one-of-a-kind underground facility.

390
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,707
They're assuming no sea dweller

391
00:37:38,843 --> 00:37:40,907
would ever dare cross the desert.

392
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:43,372
And here's a special outfit for you.

393
00:37:45,145 --> 00:37:46,612
What is that, boy's extra medium?

394
00:37:46,748 --> 00:37:47,913
It's supposed to be tight.

395
00:37:48,048 --> 00:37:49,379
The chromatophores change color

396
00:37:49,514 --> 00:37:51,017
and camouflage you for up to a minute,

397
00:37:51,153 --> 00:37:53,753
making you undetectable to most sensors.

398
00:37:53,888 --> 00:37:55,989
They'll never see you coming.

399
00:37:58,225 --> 00:37:59,572
What are we doing for comms?

400
00:37:59,596 --> 00:38:01,295
Open comms are too risky.

401
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:04,899
I'll be sending a cephalopod with you to act as a messenger.

402
00:38:06,469 --> 00:38:07,869
That's an octopus.

403
00:38:08,004 --> 00:38:11,173
Tactical Operations and Pursuit Operative.

404
00:38:11,308 --> 00:38:12,971
Topo, for short.

405
00:38:13,107 --> 00:38:15,005
Genetically engineered intelligence

406
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,472
for infiltration and espionage.

407
00:38:17,607 --> 00:38:20,849
He also plays a variety of musical instruments.

408
00:38:26,452 --> 00:38:28,692
Just try and lay low when we get in there, okay?

409
00:38:28,827 --> 00:38:30,587
You might be invisible, but your hectocotylus

410
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:32,726
is starting to smell like warm chum butter.

411
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:36,594
Aw, Topo, you dumb squid!

412
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,295
God, come on!

413
00:38:40,271 --> 00:38:41,798
Is ink piss?

414
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:44,605
The prison is guarded by fearsome Deserter remnants.

415
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:46,039
Death-worshipping ascetics

416
00:38:46,175 --> 00:38:48,305
who survived when the Sahara went dry

417
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,176
by turning to blood for sustenance.

418
00:38:51,312 --> 00:38:53,512
If they catch you, they'll bleed you dry.

419
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:56,984
When you find Orm, he'll be weak.

420
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,986
They're limiting his water supply...

421
00:39:00,122 --> 00:39:02,726
just enough to keep him alive.

422
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:08,024
And if you do see Orm,

423
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,832
you tell him that I love him.

424
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:14,397
You tell him that I think of him every day.

425
00:39:14,865 --> 00:39:16,001
I will.

426
00:39:16,136 --> 00:39:17,533
Look, I know he's family,

427
00:39:17,669 --> 00:39:20,069
but you can't forget who you're dealing with here.

428
00:39:20,204 --> 00:39:21,878
Once you've broken Orm out,

429
00:39:22,014 --> 00:39:23,518
you're not gonna be able to turn your back on him.

430
00:39:23,542 --> 00:39:26,717
You need him, but you can never trust him.

431
00:40:27,776 --> 00:40:30,880
Whoo... You look rough.

432
00:40:31,015 --> 00:40:33,878
What the hell are you doing here?

433
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,313
I'm here to break you out.

434
00:40:36,081 --> 00:40:37,281
Have you lost your mind?

435
00:40:37,417 --> 00:40:39,854
You're the one who put me here.

436
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:41,385
Eh, why you bringing up old shit?

437
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,326
We'll talk about it later.

438
00:40:43,462 --> 00:40:45,224
You cannot break me out.

439
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,558
There's a treaty with the Fishermen Kingdom.

440
00:40:47,694 --> 00:40:50,228
Look, I gotta stop David Kane from destroying the world.

441
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,809
And you're the only one that can help me.

442
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:52,999
So you do the math.

443
00:40:53,135 --> 00:40:56,433
Oh, shit.

444
00:40:56,568 --> 00:40:58,873
Come on, Cast Away. Grab Wilson. Let's roll.

445
00:40:59,008 --> 00:41:00,943
Come on. Let's go.

446
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,992
This changes nothing.

447
00:41:17,127 --> 00:41:19,126
Wouldn't have it any other way, little brother.

448
00:41:20,555 --> 00:41:22,294
Do not call me "brother."

449
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:25,869
Hermanito? Come on.

450
00:41:30,075 --> 00:41:33,102
Come on, Topo, you stupid squid!

451
00:41:33,238 --> 00:41:34,570
Wake up and open the door.

452
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,512
Topo?

453
00:41:39,043 --> 00:41:40,550
The cephalopod?

454
00:41:40,685 --> 00:41:42,545
Trust me, it wasn't my idea.

455
00:41:44,289 --> 00:41:45,420
Topo!

456
00:41:57,096 --> 00:41:59,001
All right, come on.

457
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:08,109
Wait.

458
00:42:10,345 --> 00:42:12,743
Did you... bring water?

459
00:42:12,878 --> 00:42:13,878
Yeah.

460
00:42:13,914 --> 00:42:15,718
Uh, no, sorry.

461
00:42:15,853 --> 00:42:17,514
I drank it all on the way here.

462
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:20,891
- What? - Bro, it's hot up there.

463
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,844
Whoa! Easy.

464
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,149
Whoa!

465
00:42:52,188 --> 00:42:53,587
You know how to ride one of these?

466
00:42:53,722 --> 00:42:54,847
Are you kidding?

467
00:42:54,983 --> 00:42:56,295
I don't even know what the hell it is.

468
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:57,455
- Hyaah! - What?

469
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:04,429
Yeah!

470
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:15,572
Yeah!

471
00:43:17,877 --> 00:43:19,048
Whoa.

472
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:38,001
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no!

473
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,232
All right, the water's right there.

474
00:44:17,368 --> 00:44:18,701
Let's go, skinny jeans.

475
00:46:09,085 --> 00:46:11,417
Yeah. All right.

476
00:46:11,552 --> 00:46:13,345
Good job, little brother. High-five.

477
00:46:13,481 --> 00:46:14,848
No.

478
00:46:14,983 --> 00:46:17,193
All right. Good job.

479
00:46:25,098 --> 00:46:28,461
You know, I got a bunch of king shit to do back in Atlantis

480
00:46:28,596 --> 00:46:30,206
so we should go.

481
00:46:31,106 --> 00:46:33,143
Ahh! Come on, Topo!

482
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,960
This is worse than I could have possibly imagined.

483
00:46:58,096 --> 00:47:01,669
The safety and security of Atlantis is a sacred trust.

484
00:47:01,804 --> 00:47:04,405
No king has allowed the great city wall to be breached

485
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:06,909
in a hundred generations.

486
00:47:07,045 --> 00:47:08,673
A hundred generations? Really?

487
00:47:08,808 --> 00:47:10,707
How many years is that? I'm bad with geology.

488
00:47:10,842 --> 00:47:13,315
What is that, like, a million years?

489
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:16,252
Oh? You're calling me one in a million?

490
00:47:16,387 --> 00:47:19,287
How can you make jokes at a time like this?

491
00:47:19,422 --> 00:47:21,389
It's undignified for a king to jest.

492
00:47:21,524 --> 00:47:23,655
Oh, excuse me, Your Highness, if I use comedy

493
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:26,261
to mask my feelings and deal with stress.

494
00:47:26,397 --> 00:47:27,831
Otherwise, I'd end up looking like you.

495
00:47:27,855 --> 00:47:29,892
A very tight butthole.

496
00:47:30,768 --> 00:47:33,559
Super tight.

497
00:47:33,695 --> 00:47:37,168
You know, if the pressures of leadership are too stressful,

498
00:47:37,304 --> 00:47:38,870
perhaps you should leave

499
00:47:39,005 --> 00:47:41,673
and let someone who knows what they're doing be king.

500
00:47:43,441 --> 00:47:45,274
You know what?

501
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:48,129
I cannot wait to throw your ass back in prison when this is all over.

502
00:47:48,446 --> 00:47:50,148
You won't have to.

503
00:47:50,283 --> 00:47:52,363
Once I stop David Kane, I'll surrender myself to the Fishermen.

504
00:47:52,387 --> 00:47:54,686
That is my honor to Atlantis.

505
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:57,116
You're so dramatic.

506
00:47:57,252 --> 00:47:59,428
Whatever. Just help me find this asshole.

507
00:47:59,564 --> 00:48:02,298
Well, my contact will at least know where to look.

508
00:48:04,232 --> 00:48:05,829
What happened to him?

509
00:48:08,163 --> 00:48:09,806
David Kane that I knew was ruthless,

510
00:48:09,941 --> 00:48:11,831
but he wasn't insane.

511
00:48:11,966 --> 00:48:15,311
This guy just put a gun to the world's head and pulled the trigger.

512
00:48:15,446 --> 00:48:17,610
Without even making any demands.

513
00:49:21,475 --> 00:49:23,008
Congratulations, Dr. Shin.

514
00:49:23,143 --> 00:49:25,513
That cannon of yours worked exactly how you said it would.

515
00:49:26,941 --> 00:49:27,941
Well, you found it.

516
00:49:28,045 --> 00:49:31,181
All I did was figure out how it worked.

517
00:49:31,316 --> 00:49:34,683
I didn't think we'd ever actually have to use it on anyone.

518
00:49:34,818 --> 00:49:37,292
Yeah, well, what can I say?

519
00:49:37,427 --> 00:49:39,226
Things don't always go as planned.

520
00:49:39,362 --> 00:49:40,825
But that's what I'm afraid of.

521
00:49:42,261 --> 00:49:47,370
David, this stuff could reshape the entire planet.

522
00:49:50,138 --> 00:49:51,341
Hey, doc.

523
00:49:53,902 --> 00:50:00,978
We are this close to unlocking the greatest power in human history.

524
00:50:01,113 --> 00:50:04,519
Are you really telling me you want to walk away now?

525
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:10,393
If I said yes, would you let me?

526
00:50:12,489 --> 00:50:13,759
Sure.

527
00:50:16,063 --> 00:50:17,983
You want to see how long you last in that jungle?

528
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:21,136
Be my guest.

529
00:50:34,481 --> 00:50:35,913
Yeah, I'll stick around.

530
00:50:38,955 --> 00:50:40,148
Yeah.

531
00:50:54,704 --> 00:50:57,337
Welcome to the last frontier.

532
00:50:57,473 --> 00:51:01,510
They scavenged ships from around the world to build this place.

533
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:03,941
The Sunken Citadel.

534
00:51:04,076 --> 00:51:05,647
It is the one place in the world

535
00:51:05,783 --> 00:51:08,418
where the scum of the land and sea mingle.

536
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,580
It is where people come to disappear.

537
00:51:11,715 --> 00:51:12,884
Wow.

538
00:51:13,851 --> 00:51:16,690
It's an impressive shithole.

539
00:51:16,826 --> 00:51:18,822
How have I never heard of this place before?

540
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:21,524
It is not meant to be common knowledge.

541
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:22,861
It's a pirate haven.

542
00:51:23,934 --> 00:51:24,934
Pirates?

543
00:51:26,671 --> 00:51:27,976
Listen, I don't know if you know this about me,

544
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,302
but I'm not too popular with pirates.

545
00:51:40,041 --> 00:51:41,484
Oh, I'm well aware.

546
00:51:47,659 --> 00:51:50,959
Relax. It was the only way to get us both in.

547
00:51:54,192 --> 00:51:55,832
You could've at least given me a heads up.

548
00:51:55,961 --> 00:51:57,300
Would you have gone along with it?

549
00:51:57,435 --> 00:51:59,430
- Hell, no. - Then put a hook in it.

550
00:52:32,269 --> 00:52:33,802
There. That's Kingfish.

551
00:52:33,937 --> 00:52:35,842
He is the one who put me in contact with David Kane.

552
00:52:35,866 --> 00:52:39,765
He brokers deals with pirates, mercenaries, slavers, you name it.

553
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,473
Cool.

554
00:52:41,609 --> 00:52:42,649
I'm gonna go pick a fight.

555
00:52:42,774 --> 00:52:45,381
Just let me handle this.

556
00:52:45,517 --> 00:52:47,047
He's our best shot at finding Manta,

557
00:52:47,182 --> 00:52:49,515
and he's not going to tell us anything if you go in there

558
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:51,587
flexing your muscles at him.

559
00:52:53,551 --> 00:52:56,625
You're so lucky we didn't grow up together, little brother.

560
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:00,425
Do not call me "brother."

561
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,761
Well...

562
00:53:01,897 --> 00:53:06,032
This is a bit of a surprise, isn't it?

563
00:53:06,168 --> 00:53:09,436
I didn't realize you'd been released from prison.

564
00:53:09,571 --> 00:53:12,503
It is a recent development.

565
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:16,645
Outlaws, aren't we all?

566
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:19,775
We need to find David Kane.

567
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:22,748
Bad news, I'm afraid.

568
00:53:22,883 --> 00:53:26,452
David Kane is no longer on the market.

569
00:53:26,588 --> 00:53:29,285
Not for sale at any price.

570
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:34,152
He's solely running as an independent operator.

571
00:53:34,288 --> 00:53:36,291
Where is he holed up now?

572
00:53:39,734 --> 00:53:42,264
In exchange, I offer a favor...

573
00:53:43,341 --> 00:53:46,840
from the King of Atlantis.

574
00:53:48,604 --> 00:53:50,710
You seriously expect me to play footsie with someone

575
00:53:50,846 --> 00:53:52,675
with that kind of blood on their hands?

576
00:53:52,811 --> 00:53:55,279
I don't have hands!

577
00:53:55,415 --> 00:53:56,679
Or feet!

578
00:54:01,586 --> 00:54:02,789
Um...

579
00:54:02,925 --> 00:54:06,290
Listen, if the information checks out good,

580
00:54:06,425 --> 00:54:09,627
I promise you that I won't immediately come back here

581
00:54:09,763 --> 00:54:11,293
and tear this place apart.

582
00:54:13,236 --> 00:54:15,834
That's too bad.

583
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:18,002
Traditionally, the kings of Atlantis

584
00:54:18,138 --> 00:54:22,675
have turned a blind eye to the Sunken Citadel.

585
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:26,814
Now, we have to blind it for you.

586
00:54:35,249 --> 00:54:37,257
Fine. Flex your muscles.

587
00:54:49,473 --> 00:54:51,267
Smash his stupid head in!

588
00:54:52,307 --> 00:54:53,643
Boom!

589
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:10,726
Gotcha, fatback!

590
00:55:13,864 --> 00:55:17,065
Okay! Okay! We can work this out. We can.

591
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,494
Talk.

592
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:21,066
I don't know where he is, but there have been rumors.

593
00:55:21,201 --> 00:55:23,701
A dormant volcano in the South Pacific,

594
00:55:23,836 --> 00:55:25,675
called "Devil's Deep."

595
00:55:26,276 --> 00:55:27,409
Talk faster.

596
00:55:27,544 --> 00:55:28,877
It's been barren for years.

597
00:55:29,012 --> 00:55:31,037
But travelers say there's a jungle there now.

598
00:55:31,172 --> 00:55:33,849
Navigation gets scrambled as soon as you start to get close.

599
00:55:33,984 --> 00:55:36,851
And if you get too close, you don't come back!

600
00:55:36,986 --> 00:55:39,886
If I was a betting man, and believe me, I am,

601
00:55:40,021 --> 00:55:42,289
I'd say that's where Kane is hiding out.

602
00:55:45,926 --> 00:55:47,697
We got all we needed. Let's go!

603
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:03,042
♪ Rise up, come Rise up through the fire ♪

604
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:11,452
Soon you'll be more powerful than he is.

605
00:56:11,588 --> 00:56:13,578
But you're not ready yet,

606
00:56:13,714 --> 00:56:16,458
and you involved him far too soon.

607
00:56:16,594 --> 00:56:19,087
I sense them closing in on us.

608
00:56:19,222 --> 00:56:20,895
Do I seem concerned?

609
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:22,697
Hmm?

610
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:25,725
If anything, it's even easier now.

611
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:28,232
We couldn't have planned it any better than..

612
00:56:33,707 --> 00:56:36,312
Oh. Oh.

613
00:56:36,447 --> 00:56:38,180
Hey.

614
00:56:38,316 --> 00:56:41,142
Uh, I... I just wanted to tell you that the orichalcum furnace

615
00:56:41,278 --> 00:56:43,247
is now running at peak output.

616
00:57:35,932 --> 00:57:37,136
I win.

617
00:57:41,344 --> 00:57:44,979
Topo, go back to Atlantis and give them our coordinates.

618
00:57:52,683 --> 00:57:54,523
You know what'd be amazing right now?

619
00:57:54,591 --> 00:57:56,090
Reinforcements?

620
00:57:56,225 --> 00:57:58,426
Great, big, greasy cheeseburger and a pint of Guinness.

621
00:58:00,053 --> 00:58:02,093
You gotta admit, the food is so much better up here.

622
00:58:02,226 --> 00:58:03,659
I find that hard to believe.

623
00:58:03,795 --> 00:58:05,496
Hold up.

624
00:58:05,632 --> 00:58:07,210
You telling me you never went topside to have a cheeseburger?

625
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:10,596
- What? - Or a slice of 'za? Pepperoni?

626
00:58:10,731 --> 00:58:13,072
Or a thick, juicy, medium raw steak

627
00:58:13,207 --> 00:58:14,769
with fries and a shake, and you dip it..

628
00:58:14,904 --> 00:58:17,676
Even the words that surface-dwellers give their food

629
00:58:17,811 --> 00:58:20,613
sound disgusting.

630
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:23,975
You've let your prejudices stop you from enjoying half the world.

631
00:58:24,111 --> 00:58:27,483
You should think about that. It's your loss, dude.

632
00:58:35,993 --> 00:58:37,292
Aw, yeah!

633
00:58:37,427 --> 00:58:39,658
Bet you never had one of these.

634
00:58:39,793 --> 00:58:42,465
- What is it? - It's a cockroach.

635
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,567
- You eat it? - Oh, yeah. Shrimp of the land.

636
00:59:01,889 --> 00:59:03,119
- Mmm. Mmm. - Eh?

637
00:59:03,255 --> 00:59:05,158
That's good. Here, drink this.

638
00:59:09,356 --> 00:59:10,493
Okay, you first.

639
00:59:43,865 --> 00:59:45,363
Are you seeing this?

640
00:59:48,232 --> 00:59:49,532
That's not normal?

641
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,605
Definitely not normal. Ugh.

642
00:59:59,211 --> 01:00:00,510
Let's get out of here.

643
01:00:00,646 --> 01:00:02,582
You see how dangerous the orichalcum can be?

644
01:00:02,718 --> 01:00:06,016
I bet it mutated the flora and fauna in a short amount of time,

645
01:00:06,152 --> 01:00:08,587
turning them... monstrous.

646
01:00:08,722 --> 01:00:09,589
Whoa.

647
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:20,266
Oh, shit...

648
01:00:32,306 --> 01:00:33,481
Run!

649
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:37,310
Come on.

650
01:00:39,755 --> 01:00:40,990
Faster!

651
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:49,194
What the hell are you doing?

652
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:50,862
I don't know. I'm not used to running.

653
01:00:50,997 --> 01:00:52,298
Just do what I do.

654
01:00:52,434 --> 01:00:54,114
Use your arms, use your legs. Lift them up.

655
01:00:54,637 --> 01:00:55,637
Like this?

656
01:00:57,334 --> 01:00:58,837
- Holy shit. - Yeah!

657
01:00:58,973 --> 01:01:00,438
- Wait up. - Yeah!

658
01:01:26,232 --> 01:01:28,536
Whoa!

659
01:01:32,638 --> 01:01:34,438
We have to jump. We'll survive the fall.

660
01:01:34,472 --> 01:01:36,070
Are you crazy? It's gonna hurt.

661
01:01:36,205 --> 01:01:39,246
What do you wanna do, stay here and fight the hopping demons?

662
01:01:39,381 --> 01:01:42,051
What is that? What does that say?

663
01:01:42,186 --> 01:01:43,708
The writing is ancient Atlantean.

664
01:01:43,844 --> 01:01:47,056
"A true king builds bridges."

665
01:01:51,326 --> 01:01:52,857
What are you doing?

666
01:01:57,662 --> 01:01:59,661
Got any more krill-brained ideas?

667
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:29,859
See? A true king builds bridges.

668
01:02:33,066 --> 01:02:34,662
That's a metaphor!

669
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:37,001
Hey! I forgot to tell you.

670
01:02:37,137 --> 01:02:38,336
Mom says she loves you.

671
01:02:38,472 --> 01:02:40,473
She thinks about you all the time.

672
01:02:40,608 --> 01:02:42,634
Why the hell are you telling me this now?

673
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:45,356
I don't know. I'm just tired of waiting for the right moment.

674
01:02:52,446 --> 01:02:53,452
Come on.

675
01:03:21,351 --> 01:03:23,680
Looks like my metaphor just saved your ass.

676
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,053
Uh, David? I just ran more tests,

677
01:03:35,188 --> 01:03:36,626
and this data is really disturbing.

678
01:03:36,762 --> 01:03:40,169
We have to stop burning the... orichalcum.

679
01:03:42,265 --> 01:03:43,469
David?

680
01:03:48,811 --> 01:03:50,344
Oh.

681
01:04:52,134 --> 01:04:57,675
Okay, doc, you want to know my plan so bad.

682
01:04:58,848 --> 01:05:00,682
Here it is.

683
01:05:00,818 --> 01:05:05,619
I'm gonna kill Aquaman and destroy everything he holds dear.

684
01:05:05,755 --> 01:05:11,260
I'm gonna murder his family and burn his kingdom to ash.

685
01:05:12,193 --> 01:05:16,454
I will avenge my father.

686
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:19,796
Even if I have to make a deal with the devil to do it.

687
01:05:21,228 --> 01:05:23,701
David, you can't trust the trident.

688
01:05:28,612 --> 01:05:34,144
I never draw this blade unless it's gonna taste blood.

689
01:05:36,947 --> 01:05:39,783
Pray I never show it to you again.

690
01:06:03,909 --> 01:06:06,604
We must be getting close to the radiation source.

691
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:09,021
We should wait for Atlantis to receive your message.

692
01:06:09,047 --> 01:06:10,984
We can conduct reconnaissance in the meantime.

693
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:13,759
Yeah. Look, Loki, I'm not asking for your advice on this.

694
01:06:13,788 --> 01:06:15,668
You've already lived up to your end of the deal.

695
01:06:15,757 --> 01:06:18,125
So you can go on back to Azkaban for all I care.

696
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:19,860
So, what's your plan?

697
01:06:19,996 --> 01:06:21,874
I don't have one, yet. But he came after my wife,

698
01:06:21,898 --> 01:06:24,260
which means I'm gonna pull his tongue out of his butt.

699
01:06:24,395 --> 01:06:27,033
Arthur, you are the king. You cannot let this get personal.

700
01:06:27,168 --> 01:06:29,994
This coming from the guy who turned the entire nation of Atlantis

701
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:31,738
into his own private ego trip?

702
01:06:31,874 --> 01:06:33,000
My ego?

703
01:06:33,136 --> 01:06:34,684
You're the one who swam through the front gate

704
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:36,228
and challenged my claim for the throne.

705
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:38,184
Only because you're trying to destroy the surface world.

706
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:41,277
If you weren't such an asshole, you'd still be king.

707
01:06:41,413 --> 01:06:42,884
Unbelievable.

708
01:06:43,019 --> 01:06:44,178
Wait, wait! Wait!

709
01:06:44,313 --> 01:06:46,321
You took my throne and you don't even want it?

710
01:06:46,456 --> 01:06:48,880
Are you kidding me? I hate this job.

711
01:06:49,016 --> 01:06:51,896
Only reason I'm doing it is to keep Atlantis from destroying the surface.

712
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:53,624
And I might even be screwing that up.

713
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:55,079
You really had no ambition for it?

714
01:06:55,195 --> 01:06:56,631
Absolutely not.

715
01:06:56,766 --> 01:06:58,698
From the day my father found out you existed,

716
01:06:58,834 --> 01:07:00,610
he prepared me for the moment that you would come

717
01:07:00,634 --> 01:07:01,936
and challenge me for the throne.

718
01:07:02,072 --> 01:07:03,462
Wow, that's really sad.

719
01:07:03,598 --> 01:07:04,946
Especially when you think how easily I kicked your ass

720
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:07,371
with basically no prep time whatsoever.

721
01:07:07,506 --> 01:07:09,539
Roasted.

722
01:07:09,674 --> 01:07:11,107
That is not how it happened.

723
01:07:11,243 --> 01:07:13,054
- That's exactly how it happened. - Mera saved you.

724
01:07:13,078 --> 01:07:14,916
No, she didn't. I kicked your ass.

725
01:07:15,051 --> 01:07:16,991
Nope. She made the little water tornado. I fell in it.

726
01:07:17,015 --> 01:07:18,735
Okay, shut up. I think we're here.

727
01:07:27,162 --> 01:07:28,690
Sleep, aloha.

728
01:07:28,826 --> 01:07:30,188
Come on, let's do this.

729
01:07:30,323 --> 01:07:31,603
Once this is over with,

730
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:33,073
we should go get some burgers and beers.

731
01:07:33,097 --> 01:07:34,777
- Don't push it. - Tacos and tequila.

732
01:07:34,867 --> 01:07:36,735
I don't even know those words.

733
01:07:48,184 --> 01:07:49,247
- Huh? - Shh!

734
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:04,628
Hey!

735
01:08:39,036 --> 01:08:40,469
Whoa, brother.

736
01:08:43,402 --> 01:08:44,671
Sasa!

737
01:08:50,775 --> 01:08:52,613
It's an orichalcum furnace.

738
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:55,216
All that stolen orichalcum.

739
01:08:55,351 --> 01:08:56,816
They're just burning it up.

740
01:08:56,951 --> 01:08:59,253
He's heating the atmosphere on purpose.

741
01:08:59,388 --> 01:09:00,854
This is catastrophic.

742
01:09:00,989 --> 01:09:03,381
This whole place must be heat-shielded to protect it

743
01:09:03,517 --> 01:09:05,690
from the surface's thermal satellites.

744
01:09:05,826 --> 01:09:07,326
Question is, how do we stop 'em?

745
01:09:07,462 --> 01:09:08,727
To take out this reactor,

746
01:09:08,863 --> 01:09:10,503
we would have to crater the entire island.

747
01:09:10,597 --> 01:09:14,134
Get away from there! Now!

748
01:09:14,269 --> 01:09:18,837
This blaster may be ancient, but it was built for killing Atlanteans.

749
01:09:24,978 --> 01:09:27,048
Okay, I am so sorry. I did not mean that.

750
01:09:27,184 --> 01:09:30,013
I just didn't want you to break me in half before I could surrender.

751
01:09:31,518 --> 01:09:32,884
Please take me with you.

752
01:09:34,219 --> 01:09:36,784
Knock him out and then help me hide these bodies.

753
01:09:36,919 --> 01:09:39,083
No, no. Wait, please.

754
01:09:39,219 --> 01:09:40,686
I didn't want any of this.

755
01:09:40,821 --> 01:09:43,797
All I wanted was to see Atlantis with my own eyes.

756
01:09:43,932 --> 01:09:45,933
I thought I could share its wonders with the world.

757
01:09:46,069 --> 01:09:50,064
I'm a scientist, and I just wanted to be taken seriously.

758
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:51,635
David Kane said he could help me,

759
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:53,303
but now he won't let me leave.

760
01:09:53,438 --> 01:09:56,776
You expect us to believe you have nothing to do with this?

761
01:09:57,607 --> 01:09:58,974
I know.

762
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:01,109
I've done things I'm not proud of.

763
01:10:01,245 --> 01:10:03,744
But he would've killed me if I hadn't.

764
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,115
Knock him out.

765
01:10:07,386 --> 01:10:08,555
No.

766
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:10,691
- Then I'll knock him out. - No!

767
01:10:11,656 --> 01:10:13,291
- What? - No.

768
01:10:13,426 --> 01:10:15,993
Fine!

769
01:10:16,794 --> 01:10:18,098
You can come with us.

770
01:10:18,233 --> 01:10:19,860
Oh... thank you.

771
01:10:19,995 --> 01:10:23,004
But you better start talking. Or I'm gonna give you one sasa!

772
01:10:23,139 --> 01:10:24,303
Okay, okay.

773
01:10:24,439 --> 01:10:25,673
It's the black trident.

774
01:10:25,808 --> 01:10:27,839
It's a direct link to some ancient evil.

775
01:10:27,975 --> 01:10:29,615
It gives Kane great powers and in return..

776
01:10:47,397 --> 01:10:49,459
I hate when that happens.

777
01:11:02,475 --> 01:11:03,706
Stop them!

778
01:13:05,731 --> 01:13:08,398
Whoa!

779
01:13:08,534 --> 01:13:10,004
Ow!

780
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:11,773
Ow!

781
01:13:17,045 --> 01:13:19,677
No, no, no, no, no! Not the orichalcum!

782
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:20,878
You wanna blow us up?

783
01:13:21,014 --> 01:13:22,711
- This stuff blows up? - Yes!

784
01:13:22,846 --> 01:13:25,413
My bad!

785
01:13:27,523 --> 01:13:29,614
Then stop using it!

786
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:31,760
Just shut up and let me save your ass.

787
01:13:32,327 --> 01:13:33,327
Again.

788
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:58,975
He's going to fight us without the power suit?

789
01:14:59,111 --> 01:15:00,409
I told you he's stronger now.

790
01:15:00,544 --> 01:15:04,116
He's still just a surface-dweller.

791
01:15:12,727 --> 01:15:14,423
- Bro! - Bah!

792
01:15:18,766 --> 01:15:22,697
I never expected to see you two fighting side by side.

793
01:15:22,833 --> 01:15:25,467
We're making a special exception just for you.

794
01:15:30,813 --> 01:15:32,974
No one hits my brother but me.

795
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:37,781
I was gonna kill you last, but thanks for dropping by.

796
01:15:37,917 --> 01:15:39,514
You're making this easy.

797
01:15:53,097 --> 01:15:54,263
Yeah!

798
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:56,971
Come at me, the killer of kings.

799
01:16:57,194 --> 01:16:59,099
Take that island down!

800
01:17:22,086 --> 01:17:23,552
Fire at will!

801
01:17:35,201 --> 01:17:37,005
We've got to get out of here.

802
01:17:47,283 --> 01:17:48,963
Malfunction. Malfunction.

803
01:17:49,014 --> 01:17:50,480
Warning. Warning.

804
01:18:16,308 --> 01:18:18,145
Shin, let's go!

805
01:18:23,149 --> 01:18:24,651
What are you waiting for?

806
01:18:24,787 --> 01:18:26,615
Fire the Goddamn cannon!

807
01:19:30,353 --> 01:19:31,992
I'm sorry to drag you all into this.

808
01:19:32,016 --> 01:19:34,256
But the Fishermen can't think that Atlantis was involved.

809
01:19:34,284 --> 01:19:37,618
Atlantis does not command the armies of Xebel. I do.

810
01:19:37,754 --> 01:19:39,125
And the Brine Kingdom

811
01:19:39,261 --> 01:19:41,224
has not forgotten its debt to you.

812
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:43,687
You may count on us always.

813
01:19:43,823 --> 01:19:45,626
Something happened to me.

814
01:19:45,761 --> 01:19:48,592
When I touched that black trident.

815
01:19:48,728 --> 01:19:50,599
Why is he even here?

816
01:19:50,735 --> 01:19:52,402
He should be on his way back to prison.

817
01:19:52,537 --> 01:19:54,203
We should hear what he has to say.

818
01:19:54,339 --> 01:19:56,110
I made that mistake once.

819
01:19:56,246 --> 01:19:58,338
That's why I know he can't be trusted.

820
01:19:58,474 --> 01:20:01,611
And he cut off my claw.

821
01:20:01,746 --> 01:20:04,284
This thing took a whole year to grow back.

822
01:20:04,419 --> 01:20:06,885
Look, he wants to stop Manta same as we do.

823
01:20:07,021 --> 01:20:08,488
And just for the record,

824
01:20:08,624 --> 01:20:10,917
the only reason we made it this far is because of him.

825
01:20:13,159 --> 01:20:14,657
I saw the Lost Kingdom.

826
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:21,032
Mom, I don't know enough about this.

827
01:20:21,167 --> 01:20:22,868
Is that even possible?

828
01:20:23,003 --> 01:20:26,031
All anyone knows for sure is there once was a seventh kingdom

829
01:20:26,166 --> 01:20:28,905
and then one day, just before the fall,

830
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:32,005
every record of it was stricken from the chronicles.

831
01:20:32,141 --> 01:20:34,777
How do you know what you saw was the Lost Kingdom?

832
01:20:34,912 --> 01:20:38,015
No one even knows what it was called anymore.

833
01:20:38,151 --> 01:20:39,715
It's called Necrus.

834
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:42,421
And I didn't just see it.

835
01:20:43,726 --> 01:20:44,726
I knew it.

836
01:20:45,955 --> 01:20:49,659
It's almost like I was... remembering it.

837
01:20:50,893 --> 01:20:54,532
Flashes of someone else's memories.

838
01:20:55,301 --> 01:20:56,833
During King Atlan's time,

839
01:20:56,968 --> 01:21:01,308
there were seven united kingdoms of Atlantis.

840
01:21:01,444 --> 01:21:05,510
And the Black City was a curse upon them all.

841
01:21:12,187 --> 01:21:13,784
By exploiting orichalcum,

842
01:21:13,919 --> 01:21:17,223
Necrus rapidly became a superpower unlike any other.

843
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:19,125
But it came at a terrible price.

844
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:22,155
Poisoning the land, the sea,

845
01:21:22,291 --> 01:21:25,530
even the mind of the tyrant who ruled Necrus.

846
01:21:28,598 --> 01:21:30,935
Atlan's own brother, Kordax.

847
01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:32,945
Atlan pleaded with him

848
01:21:32,969 --> 01:21:35,166
to stop using it before the world

849
01:21:35,301 --> 01:21:36,836
was irrevocably damaged.

850
01:21:36,972 --> 01:21:39,580
However, Kordax resented Atlan,

851
01:21:39,715 --> 01:21:42,279
thinking his own brother was trying to steal his power.

852
01:21:42,414 --> 01:21:47,987
So, he resorted to dark magic and crafted an instrument of evil.

853
01:21:48,123 --> 01:21:49,547
That black trident.

854
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:02,297
He transformed his people and himself into monsters...

855
01:22:06,471 --> 01:22:08,439
...to fight Atlantis.

856
01:22:08,575 --> 01:22:10,476
So, the two brothers went to war.

857
01:22:19,553 --> 01:22:21,388
But Atlan defeated Kordax

858
01:22:21,524 --> 01:22:24,425
and imprisoned him and all of Necrus

859
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,387
with a spell cast with his own blood...

860
01:22:30,561 --> 01:22:35,727
...to ensure that Kordax's dark power would never be found.

861
01:22:35,862 --> 01:22:38,768
And that is why Necrus is stricken from the chronicles.

862
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:53,354
This evil was supposed to remain frozen for eternity.

863
01:22:55,652 --> 01:22:57,457
But David Kane has found it.

864
01:22:59,051 --> 01:23:01,724
And it's slowly possessing him.

865
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:03,558
But even with the ice cap melting,

866
01:23:03,693 --> 01:23:05,631
Kordax still can't be freed.

867
01:23:05,766 --> 01:23:08,335
Atlan used blood magic to seal Kordax in his prison.

868
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:10,303
Only Atlan himself could release him.

869
01:23:10,439 --> 01:23:12,005
Manta doesn't need Atlan himself.

870
01:23:12,141 --> 01:23:15,309
Manta needs Atlan's blood.

871
01:23:15,445 --> 01:23:17,171
Blood magic isn't really magic, it's DNA.

872
01:23:17,307 --> 01:23:22,572
The key to Kordax's prison is the royal bloodline itself.

873
01:23:22,708 --> 01:23:26,387
That means he needs blood from either you, me or Arthur.

874
01:23:28,554 --> 01:23:29,885
We're the end of the bloodline.

875
01:23:34,128 --> 01:23:36,263
No, we're not.

876
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:39,039
...Wildfires would have made headlines across the world,

877
01:23:39,063 --> 01:23:41,266
but now, they're almost a weekly occurrence.

878
01:23:41,402 --> 01:23:44,569
We're witnessing unprecedented weather events across the globe,

879
01:23:44,704 --> 01:23:46,067
and meteorologists are at a loss

880
01:23:46,202 --> 01:23:47,969
to explain this rapid change in climate.

881
01:23:48,104 --> 01:23:49,840
From sweltering heatwaves and droughts,

882
01:23:49,975 --> 01:23:51,874
which are shattering temperature records,

883
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:53,580
to torrential rains and floodings...

884
01:23:53,715 --> 01:23:55,555
- What is going on? - ...hurricane bearing down

885
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:58,551
on the East Coast, leaving one million homes without power..

886
01:24:00,684 --> 01:24:03,455
Make that a million and one.

887
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:05,585
I gotta get the flashlight, bubba.

888
01:24:23,209 --> 01:24:26,845
I'm gonna leave you alive, so he can watch you die.

889
01:24:35,418 --> 01:24:36,551
Dad!

890
01:24:36,687 --> 01:24:38,558
- Tom! - Dad!

891
01:24:39,588 --> 01:24:40,791
Tom!

892
01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:43,360
No! Dad!

893
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:44,795
Where's Junior?

894
01:24:48,093 --> 01:24:49,870
No!

895
01:24:50,005 --> 01:24:51,399
I'm sorry, son.

896
01:24:51,534 --> 01:24:53,304
Where's Junior?

897
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:56,944
Manta... took Junior.

898
01:24:57,079 --> 01:24:58,908
- No! - No!

899
01:24:59,882 --> 01:25:01,482
No!

900
01:25:56,904 --> 01:25:59,071
The medics have stabilized his condition.

901
01:25:59,206 --> 01:26:00,606
He will be okay.

902
01:26:00,741 --> 01:26:02,305
We just picked up a signal.

903
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,043
It's faint,

904
01:26:04,179 --> 01:26:06,740
but it's broadcasting on an old Atlantean sonar frequency.

905
01:26:06,875 --> 01:26:08,813
Headed to Antarctica.

906
01:26:09,882 --> 01:26:12,278
- Bring our little one back. - I will.

907
01:26:14,223 --> 01:26:16,151
I've dreamed of this.

908
01:26:16,286 --> 01:26:19,087
The two of you standing together as brothers.

909
01:26:22,863 --> 01:26:25,093
Promise me you will protect each other.

910
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:30,263
Promise me, Orm.

911
01:26:44,217 --> 01:26:45,245
Go.

912
01:27:11,537 --> 01:27:13,979
Great waves, Nereus.

913
01:27:14,115 --> 01:27:18,381
Your warship is powerful, but it's slower than a sea cow.

914
01:27:18,516 --> 01:27:23,286
I say we ditch all this dead weight and travel light. Hmm?

915
01:27:23,422 --> 01:27:25,886
And what are you gonna do when he turns on that sonic cannon?

916
01:27:26,022 --> 01:27:27,828
Our only chance is to hit him

917
01:27:27,963 --> 01:27:30,563
with total overwhelming force from every direction.

918
01:27:30,698 --> 01:27:32,561
Not with Junior in the crossfire.

919
01:27:32,697 --> 01:27:33,897
What choice do we have?

920
01:27:34,033 --> 01:27:35,696
We have no defense against that cannon.

921
01:27:35,832 --> 01:27:37,064
Well, wait a minute.

922
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:38,869
So this cannon sends out soundwaves

923
01:27:39,005 --> 01:27:40,969
that messes with our nervous system, right?

924
01:27:41,105 --> 01:27:43,972
That's right. Ultrasonic echoes.

925
01:27:44,108 --> 01:27:45,635
Well, what if we disrupt those echoes

926
01:27:45,771 --> 01:27:47,545
with another soundwave on the same frequency,

927
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,682
but just much, much louder?

928
01:27:49,817 --> 01:27:52,178
You wanna disrupt their disruption?

929
01:27:52,314 --> 01:27:54,017
Well, that's gonna be the easy part.

930
01:27:54,949 --> 01:27:57,119
Take your weapons.

931
01:27:58,525 --> 01:28:00,023
And ready your steeds.

932
01:28:09,161 --> 01:28:10,334
Hmm.

933
01:28:20,516 --> 01:28:22,443
Really doesn't like you, does he?

934
01:28:53,947 --> 01:28:55,982
We made a lot of progress, doc.

935
01:28:56,118 --> 01:28:58,416
They destroyed the furnace before we could finish the job,

936
01:28:58,552 --> 01:28:59,918
but we were damn close.

937
01:29:00,053 --> 01:29:02,723
One well-placed missile should do the trick.

938
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:07,695
My God, what did we do?

939
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:10,259
Nothing the world wasn't already doing.

940
01:29:10,395 --> 01:29:13,062
All we did was fast forward things a few years.

941
01:29:13,198 --> 01:29:14,812
The ice hasn't fully melted yet,

942
01:29:14,836 --> 01:29:16,968
but our scanning reveals a weak spot.

943
01:29:17,667 --> 01:29:18,870
Here.

944
01:29:19,006 --> 01:29:21,368
This will lead you straight to Kordax.

945
01:29:23,072 --> 01:29:24,943
Power up the sonic cannon.

946
01:29:26,482 --> 01:29:27,946
Bag the child and suit up.

947
01:29:54,609 --> 01:29:57,505
Yah!

948
01:29:57,641 --> 01:30:00,143
Captain, we have multiple incoming hostiles.

949
01:30:01,846 --> 01:30:03,179
You're too late.

950
01:30:12,854 --> 01:30:14,025
No.

951
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:41,486
Commence charge.

952
01:31:31,937 --> 01:31:35,071
You've got to be kidding me.

953
01:32:11,105 --> 01:32:12,572
Astounding.

954
01:32:55,488 --> 01:32:57,718
This place is immense. It could be anywhere.

955
01:32:57,854 --> 01:33:00,288
The throne of Necrus is in the heart of the city.

956
01:33:00,424 --> 01:33:01,904
I sense something in the water.

957
01:33:01,929 --> 01:33:03,169
Everyone, light it up.

958
01:33:07,769 --> 01:33:12,768
Didn't you say that Kordax turned his people into an army of monsters?

959
01:33:12,903 --> 01:33:14,641
Yes. I did.

960
01:33:14,777 --> 01:33:16,537
Keep your eyes open.

961
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:19,574
Well, that'll be easy. Mine don't close.

962
01:33:19,710 --> 01:33:22,675
Everyone stand ready. Something's coming.

963
01:33:27,721 --> 01:33:29,950
Fire at will!

964
01:33:46,307 --> 01:33:47,580
I think this goes all the way through.

965
01:33:47,604 --> 01:33:50,710
My men and I can deal with these worms.

966
01:33:50,845 --> 01:33:53,646
Go now and save the prince.

967
01:33:53,782 --> 01:33:55,279
Thank you, Your Highness.

968
01:33:57,380 --> 01:34:00,013
Come on, you spineless worms!

969
01:34:00,148 --> 01:34:01,582
Bring it on!

970
01:35:10,492 --> 01:35:11,586
Help me!

971
01:36:14,448 --> 01:36:16,552
Give me the child.

972
01:37:10,635 --> 01:37:14,042
You picked the wrong day to grow a spine, doc.

973
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:20,020
Get behind the portcullis!

974
01:37:20,155 --> 01:37:23,155
We need to close the gate!

975
01:38:00,225 --> 01:38:03,152
Get away from my son!

976
01:38:03,288 --> 01:38:06,464
Your blood will do just fine.

977
01:38:08,201 --> 01:38:11,297
You want blood? Come get it!

978
01:38:25,247 --> 01:38:26,783
Aquaman!

979
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:01,915
Oh!

980
01:39:15,068 --> 01:39:18,732
You wear my brother's armor, and wield his trident,

981
01:39:18,868 --> 01:39:21,566
but you're only half the man he was.

982
01:39:21,702 --> 01:39:24,438
How pathetic.

983
01:39:39,091 --> 01:39:40,156
Mera!

984
01:39:55,570 --> 01:39:56,838
Go!

985
01:40:11,325 --> 01:40:13,118
Mera...

986
01:40:14,290 --> 01:40:15,494
Run!

987
01:40:19,130 --> 01:40:21,195
Free me from my prison,

988
01:40:21,330 --> 01:40:27,103
and all my power will be yours to wield as you desire.

989
01:41:02,703 --> 01:41:07,678
Kill him, and you will be Ocean Master again!

990
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:17,914
Well, now this is certainly an improvement.

991
01:41:18,050 --> 01:41:20,593
Powerful, Atlantean body.

992
01:41:20,728 --> 01:41:23,923
And this one hates you more than the other one did.

993
01:41:24,059 --> 01:41:25,541
It's not true. Come on, little brother.

994
01:41:25,565 --> 01:41:26,805
I know you're in there.

995
01:41:26,929 --> 01:41:29,359
Don't you see? You can't win.

996
01:41:29,494 --> 01:41:32,870
Either you kill your brother or you die.

997
01:41:48,018 --> 01:41:52,452
By an Atlan's blood, this magic is broken.

998
01:42:05,771 --> 01:42:09,476
My eternal night is ending.

999
01:42:16,243 --> 01:42:19,079
I'm done fighting your puppets, Kordax.

1000
01:42:20,254 --> 01:42:22,522
I'm coming for you.

1001
01:42:25,393 --> 01:42:26,399
- Give it to me! - No!

1002
01:42:26,423 --> 01:42:27,891
I can end this.

1003
01:42:28,026 --> 01:42:31,729
Don't let him take it! Hasn't he taken enough already?

1004
01:42:33,266 --> 01:42:34,433
Yield the throne.

1005
01:42:34,569 --> 01:42:37,868
It's time for me to reclaim my destiny.

1006
01:42:38,004 --> 01:42:40,997
It would be foolish to think he could ever change.

1007
01:42:41,133 --> 01:42:42,735
I knew you would do this.

1008
01:42:42,871 --> 01:42:44,641
You are the one true king.

1009
01:42:44,777 --> 01:42:48,244
Atlantis deserves its one true king.

1010
01:42:50,614 --> 01:42:54,481
I am the one true king!

1011
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:03,360
You know, there was a time

1012
01:43:03,423 --> 01:43:05,959
when I wanted to meet you more than anything.

1013
01:43:06,095 --> 01:43:08,157
Let you know that you weren't alone,

1014
01:43:08,292 --> 01:43:09,901
that we were in it together.

1015
01:43:10,037 --> 01:43:12,132
Promise me you'll protect each other.

1016
01:43:17,075 --> 01:43:20,745
Come on, little brother, let's end this bastard.

1017
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:24,043
I meant what I said when I first met you.

1018
01:43:24,178 --> 01:43:26,811
No matter what, you are not alone.

1019
01:43:26,947 --> 01:43:28,285
We're in this together.

1020
01:43:31,820 --> 01:43:33,285
You are my brother.

1021
01:43:38,967 --> 01:43:39,967
Orm.

1022
01:43:42,971 --> 01:43:43,971
Let go.

1023
01:43:58,647 --> 01:44:00,081
Orm, let it go.

1024
01:44:19,570 --> 01:44:22,534
I live again!

1025
01:44:22,670 --> 01:44:26,705
I have waited countless centuries in the dark

1026
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:28,747
for this moment.

1027
01:44:34,715 --> 01:44:36,084
Shit.

1028
01:44:43,625 --> 01:44:45,027
Arthur!

1029
01:46:11,317 --> 01:46:12,785
Never.

1030
01:46:20,721 --> 01:46:23,829
Arthur, we've gotta go. The magic is broken.

1031
01:46:38,809 --> 01:46:40,076
Let's get outta here!

1032
01:46:52,457 --> 01:46:54,183
Hurry!

1033
01:46:58,127 --> 01:46:59,925
That's right!

1034
01:47:00,061 --> 01:47:01,867
Come on, baby! Yeah!

1035
01:47:17,783 --> 01:47:21,348
Yeah!

1036
01:47:39,273 --> 01:47:40,273
My love.

1037
01:47:42,008 --> 01:47:44,338
Hi, baby boy.

1038
01:47:53,848 --> 01:47:54,953
Shin.

1039
01:47:55,554 --> 01:47:56,889
Thank you.

1040
01:48:03,364 --> 01:48:04,626
Astounding.

1041
01:48:09,467 --> 01:48:12,898
All here looking intact. That's good. That's good.

1042
01:48:13,034 --> 01:48:14,034
Well, I'm not.

1043
01:48:14,168 --> 01:48:16,340
My claw got cut off.

1044
01:48:16,475 --> 01:48:17,536
Again!

1045
01:48:19,445 --> 01:48:20,656
You're one tough crustacean, Your Highness.

1046
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:21,880
Bah!

1047
01:48:22,016 --> 01:48:24,444
As far as I'm concerned, your debt is paid.

1048
01:48:25,580 --> 01:48:27,854
Not everybody's gonna see it that way though.

1049
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:35,125
It's too bad you went and had yourself killed back there.

1050
01:48:36,958 --> 01:48:37,958
Yes.

1051
01:48:38,059 --> 01:48:39,426
All this ice.

1052
01:48:40,902 --> 01:48:43,199
It'd be impossible to find the body.

1053
01:48:44,829 --> 01:48:46,077
Just lay low for a while.

1054
01:48:46,101 --> 01:48:48,303
But don't go too far.

1055
01:48:48,438 --> 01:48:50,240
I may need to call you up for some advice.

1056
01:48:50,375 --> 01:48:53,473
You know, with the whole running the kingdom thing.

1057
01:48:59,519 --> 01:49:00,612
Thank you...

1058
01:49:02,283 --> 01:49:04,154
brother.

1059
01:49:19,073 --> 01:49:21,336
You're not as bad at this as you think.

1060
01:49:22,803 --> 01:49:26,011
The people of Atlantis are lucky to have you.

1061
01:49:27,045 --> 01:49:28,810
You are everything I was not.

1062
01:49:28,946 --> 01:49:32,116
You do the right thing when doing the wrong thing is much easier.

1063
01:49:33,217 --> 01:49:35,020
And you're willing to ask for help

1064
01:49:35,954 --> 01:49:37,484
even from your worst enemy.

1065
01:49:39,353 --> 01:49:40,652
I know it may not feel like

1066
01:49:40,787 --> 01:49:42,628
you know what you're doing sometimes, but...

1067
01:49:42,764 --> 01:49:45,061
keep trusting your instincts.

1068
01:49:45,197 --> 01:49:48,264
If you lead, Atlantis will follow.

1069
01:49:51,403 --> 01:49:55,040
After all, a true king builds bridges, right?

1070
01:49:56,109 --> 01:49:57,537
I thought that was just a metaphor.

1071
01:50:00,372 --> 01:50:05,413
Well, your metaphor might have just saved the world's ass.

1072
01:50:29,242 --> 01:50:30,742
We've got breaking news.

1073
01:50:30,878 --> 01:50:32,310
We are witnessing history.

1074
01:50:32,445 --> 01:50:34,613
A moment the ramifications of which simply...

1075
01:50:34,749 --> 01:50:35,613
cannot be overstated.

1076
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:40,075
A first contact...

1077
01:50:40,210 --> 01:50:41,770
...with the undersea nation of Atlantis.

1078
01:50:41,851 --> 01:50:43,891
An entire civilization hidden for thousands of years

1079
01:50:43,956 --> 01:50:45,556
about to be revealed.

1080
01:50:52,023 --> 01:50:53,341
I think it's safe to say

1081
01:50:53,365 --> 01:50:54,645
the world will never be the same.

1082
01:50:54,695 --> 01:50:56,167
The King of Atlantis

1083
01:50:56,302 --> 01:50:57,742
has reached out to the United Nations

1084
01:50:57,766 --> 01:50:59,570
and will be officially seeking membership.

1085
01:50:59,705 --> 01:51:00,950
And is expected to propose a joint effort

1086
01:51:00,974 --> 01:51:02,472
to reverse the climate issues.

1087
01:51:02,608 --> 01:51:04,411
We are told that this was the result

1088
01:51:04,435 --> 01:51:06,705
of weeks of secret negotiations with the United Nations.

1089
01:51:06,841 --> 01:51:08,561
We now go live to Ellis Island,

1090
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:10,590
where the first official ambassador from Atlantis

1091
01:51:10,614 --> 01:51:13,118
is about to address the United Nations.

1092
01:51:21,724 --> 01:51:25,224
I come here today as a representative of two worlds.

1093
01:51:25,359 --> 01:51:27,797
The land and the sea.

1094
01:51:31,363 --> 01:51:35,497
And I stand here as proof that change is coming to both.

1095
01:51:35,633 --> 01:51:41,311
And I'm calling for global unity for a global crisis.

1096
01:51:41,446 --> 01:51:43,412
To finally bring harmony between us

1097
01:51:43,547 --> 01:51:46,515
and the natural balance of our world.

1098
01:51:46,650 --> 01:51:48,381
Atlantis stands ready to help contribute

1099
01:51:48,516 --> 01:51:50,716
its science and technology.

1100
01:51:50,852 --> 01:51:52,748
And with your knowledge of the air,

1101
01:51:52,883 --> 01:51:54,557
and our knowledge of the seas,

1102
01:51:54,692 --> 01:51:57,762
together we can write the next chapter in our story,

1103
01:51:57,898 --> 01:51:59,765
rather than its ending.

1104
01:51:59,901 --> 01:52:03,533
Sometimes it's gonna seem like our differences are too extreme,

1105
01:52:03,669 --> 01:52:07,129
but all we have to do is look beneath the surface,

1106
01:52:07,264 --> 01:52:08,747
to see that we're all here on this planet

1107
01:52:08,771 --> 01:52:11,308
with the same goals and aspirations.

1108
01:52:11,444 --> 01:52:12,816
- Even when our customs... - Here you go.

1109
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:13,988
...might seem strange and unfamiliar.

1110
01:52:14,012 --> 01:52:15,442
Beer and a cheeseburger.

1111
01:52:15,578 --> 01:52:17,776
Extra greasy like you asked for.

1112
01:52:19,420 --> 01:52:21,685
And by overcoming our prejudices,

1113
01:52:21,820 --> 01:52:25,087
we'll become stronger and learn more about ourselves.

1114
01:52:25,223 --> 01:52:28,754
We can seize this moment to create a better more hopeful future,

1115
01:52:28,890 --> 01:52:32,593
for our children, and our families.

1116
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,833
My name is Arthur Curry.

1117
01:52:35,969 --> 01:52:39,805
I'm the rightful sovereign of the undersea nation of Atlantis.

1118
01:52:39,940 --> 01:52:41,838
I'm a father, a brother,

1119
01:52:41,974 --> 01:52:44,605
a warrior and a friend.

1120
01:52:45,737 --> 01:52:47,339
I'm the King of Atlantis.

1121
01:52:49,112 --> 01:52:50,478
I am Aquaman.
