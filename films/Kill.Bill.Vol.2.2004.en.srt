1
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,530
<i>Do you find me sadistic?</i>

2
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,320
<i>You know, Kiddo...</i>

3
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,870
<i>...I'd like to believe...</i>

4
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,580
<i>...you're aware enough, even now...</i>

5
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,290
<i>...to know that there's nothing sadistic...</i>

6
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,250
<i>...in my actions.</i>

7
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,130
<i>At this moment...</i>

8
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,130
<i>At this moment...</i>

9
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,220
<i>...this is me...</i>

10
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,930
<i>...at my most masochistic.</i>

11
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,350
<i>Bill.</i>

12
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,980
<i>It's your ba...</i>

13
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,940
<i>Looked dead, didn't I?</i>

14
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,610
Well, I wasn't.

15
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,280
But it wasn't from lack of trying,
I can tell you that.

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,490
Actually, Bill's last bullet
put me in a coma -

17
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,870
a coma I was to lie in for four years.

18
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,960
When I woke up, I went on what
the movie advertisements refer to as

19
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,590
"a roaring rampage of revenge."

20
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,720
I roared, and I rampaged,

21
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,470
and I got bloody satisfaction.

22
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,350
I've killed a hell of a lot of people
to get to this point,

23
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,640
but I've only one more.

24
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,730
The last one.

25
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,400
The one I'm driving to right now.

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,190
The only one left.

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,910
And when I arrive at my destination,

28
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,370
I am gonna kill Bill.

29
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,980
<i>The incident that happened
at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel</i>

30
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,230
<i>that put this whole gory story into motion</i>

31
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,820
<i>has since become legend.</i>

32
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,820
<i>"Massacre at Two Pines."</i>

33
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,700
<i>That's what the newspapers called it.</i>

34
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,450
<i>The local TV news called it,</i>

35
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,790
<i>"The El Paso, Texas
Wedding Chapel Massacre."</i>

36
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,580
<i>How it happened, who was there,</i>

37
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,460
<i>how many got killed
and who killed them -</i>

38
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,260
<i>changes depending on
who's telling the story.</i>

39
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,800
<i>In actual fact, the massacre didn't
happen during a wedding at all.</i>

40
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,050
<i>It was a wedding rehearsal.</i>

41
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,930
Now, when we come
to the part where I say,

42
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,560
"You may kiss the bride,"
you may kiss the bride.

43
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,610
But don't stick your tongue in her mouth.

44
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,820
This might be funny to your friends,

45
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,200
but it would be embarrassing
to your parents.

46
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,910
We'll try to restrain ourselves, Reverend.

47
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Y'all got a song?

48
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,750
How about "Love Me Tender"?
I can play that.

49
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,880
- Sure.
- Yeah.

50
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,300
"Love Me Tender" would be great.

51
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,510
Rufus - he's the man.

52
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,640
Rufus, who was that
that you used to play for?

53
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,560
Rufus Thomas.

54
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,560
Rufus Thomas.
Rufus Thomas.

55
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,060
I was a Drell. I was a Drifter.
I was a Coaster.

56
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,690
I was part of the Gang.
I was a Barkay.

57
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,110
If they come through Texas,
I done played with 'em.

58
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,950
Rufus - he's the man.

59
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,710
- Have I forgotten anything?
- Um...

60
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,380
Oh yes, you forgot, uh,
the seating arrangements.

61
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,130
- Thank you, Mother.
- Yes.

62
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,380
Now, the way we normally do this -

63
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,550
we have the bride's side,
and then we have the groom's side.

64
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,850
But since the bride
ain't got nobody comin',

65
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,980
and the groom's got
far too many people comin'...

66
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,440
Well, yeah, they're comin'
all the way from Oklahoma.

67
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,150
Right...

68
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,280
Well, I don't see no problem with...

69
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,660
...the groom's side
sharing the bride's side.

70
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,580
- Do you, Mother?
- I don't have a problem with that.

71
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,660
But, uh...

72
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,080
Honey, you know, it would be good
if you had somebody come.

73
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,250
You know, as a sign of good faith?

74
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,960
Well, I don't have anybody...

75
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,130
...except for Tommy and my friends.

76
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,430
- You have no family?
- Well, I'm workin' on changing that.

77
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,810
Mrs. Harmony, we're all the family
this little angel's ever gonna need.

78
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,610
I'm not feeling very well,
and this bitch is starting to piss me off.

79
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,280
So while y'all blather on,
I'm gonna go outside and get some air.

80
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,450
OK. Um, uh, Reverend, sorry, uh...

81
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,950
- She's gonna go out and get some air.
- Yeah. Given her delicate condition...

82
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,870
She just needs a few minutes
to get it together. She'll be OK.

83
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,330
Right...

84
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,870
Hello, Kiddo.

85
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,710
- How did you find me?
- I'm the man.

86
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,590
What are you doin' here?

87
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,800
What am I doin'?

88
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,430
Well...

89
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,980
...moment ago I was playin' my flute.

90
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,980
At this moment...

91
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,570
...I'm lookin' at the most beautiful bride
these old eyes have ever seen.

92
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,000
- Why are you here?
- Last look.

93
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,670
- Are you gonna be nice?
- I've never been nice in my whole life.

94
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,670
But I'll do my best to be sweet.

95
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Hmm.

96
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,260
I always told you...

97
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,720
...your sweet side is you best side.

98
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,690
I guess that's why you're
the only one who's ever seen it.

99
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,990
- So you got a bun in the oven.
- Hmm.

100
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,740
- I'm knocked up.
- Jeez, Louise.

101
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:26,410
That young man of yours sure doesn't
believe in wasting time, does he?

102
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,040
Have you seen Tommy?

103
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,380
- Big guy in the tux?
- Yes.

104
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,510
Then I saw him.

105
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,930
I like his hair.

106
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,470
You promised you'd be nice.

107
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,100
No, I said I'd do my best.
That's hardly a promise.

108
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,440
But you're right.

109
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,980
What does your young man
do for a living?

110
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,320
He owns a used record store
here in El Paso.

111
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,950
- Ah. Music lover, eh?
- He's fond of music.

112
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,290
Aren't we all?

113
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,090
And what are you doing
for a J-O-B these days?

114
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,510
I work in the record store.

115
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,050
<i>Aso.</i>

116
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,180
It all suddenly seems so clear.

117
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,270
- Do you like it?
- Yeah. I like it a lot, smartass.

118
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,860
I get to listen to music all day...

119
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,570
...talk about music all day.
It's really cool.

120
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,450
It's gonna be a great environment
for my little girl to grow up in.

121
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,880
As opposed to jetting around the world,
killing human beings,

122
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,670
and being paid vast sums of money?

123
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,340
Precisely.

124
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,260
Well, my old friend...

125
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,720
...to each his own.

126
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,350
However, all cockblockery aside...

127
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:13,900
I am looking forward
to meeting your young man.

128
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,360
I happen to be, more or less,
particular whom my gal marries.

129
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,620
- You want to come to the wedding?
- Only if I can sit on the bride's side.

130
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,830
You'll find it a bit lonely on my side.

131
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,330
Your side always was a bit lonely.

132
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,250
But I wouldn't sit anywhere else.

133
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,880
You know...

134
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,430
...I had the loveliest dream about you...

135
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,890
Oh, here's Tommy!
Call me Arlene.

136
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,140
- You must be Tommy!
- Uh-huh.

137
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,430
Arlene's told me so much about you.

138
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,560
- Honey, you OK?
- Oh, I'm fine.

139
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,190
Tommy, I'd like you to meet my father.

140
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,440
Oh, my God!

141
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,650
Oh, my God, this is great!

142
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,320
I'm so glad to meet you, sir... uh, Dad.

143
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,660
The name's Bill.

144
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,580
Well, it's great to meet you... Bill.

145
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,290
- Arlene told me you couldn't make it.
- Surprise.

146
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,580
That's my pop for ya.
Always full of surprises.

147
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:19,090
Well, in the surprise department...

148
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,550
...the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

149
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,880
- When did you get in?
- Just now.

150
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,970
- Did you come straight from Australia?
- Of course.

151
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,510
Daddy, I told Tommy that you were
in Perth mining for silver, and...

152
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,980
...no one could reach you.

153
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,480
Lucky for us all, that's not the case.

154
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,520
So...

155
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,320
What's this all about?
I've heard of wedding rehearsals,

156
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,780
but I don't believe I've ever heard of
a wedding dress rehearsal before.

157
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,120
We thought,

158
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,450
"Why pay so much money for a dress
you're only going to wear once?"

159
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,460
Especially when Arlene looks
so goddamn beautiful in it.

160
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,080
So, I think we're going to try to get
all the mileage we can out of it.

161
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,880
Isn't it supposed to be bad luck
for the groom to see the bride

162
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,090
in her wedding dress
before the ceremony?

163
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,510
Well, I guess I just believe
in living dangerously.

164
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,480
I know just what you mean.

165
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,810
<i>Son.
Some of us have places to be.</i>

166
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,400
<i>Sure do.</i>

167
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,860
Look, we got to go through this one
more time. So, why don't you have a s...

168
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,860
Oh, my God. What am I thinking?
You should give her away!

169
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,740
Tommy, that's not exactly
Daddy's cup of tea.

170
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,250
I think Father would be
much more comfortable

171
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,290
- sitting with the rest of the guests.
- Hmm. Really?

172
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,500
That's asking a lot.

173
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,840
Oh. OK.
Well, forget it.

174
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,880
But how about we go out
to dinner tonight to celebrate?

175
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,550
Only on the condition that
I pay for everything.

176
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,970
Deal. We got to do this now.

177
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:57,100
- Can I watch?
- Absolutely. Have a seat.

178
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,480
- Which is the bride's side?
- Right over here.

179
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,980
Mother, here we go!

180
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,780
Now son, about them vows...

181
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,200
Bill...

182
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,920
- I just want...
- You don't owe me a damn thing.

183
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,590
If he's the man you want...

184
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,510
...then go stand by him.

185
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:57,240
- Do I look pretty?
- Oh, yes.

186
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,840
Thank you.

187
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,330
What the hell?

188
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,750
No! Bill!

189
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,130
You tellin' me she cut her way through
88 bodyguards before she got to O-Ren?

190
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,260
Nah, there wasn't really 88 of 'em.

191
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,100
They just call themselves
"The Crazy 88"

192
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,220
- How come?
- I don't know.

193
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,350
I guess they thought it sounded cool.

194
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,270
Anyhow, they all fell
under her Hanzo sword.

195
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,360
- She got a Hanzo sword?
- He made one for her.

196
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,860
Didn't he swear a blood oath
to never make another sword?

197
00:15:56,950 --> 00:16:00,530
It would appear he has broken it.

198
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,500
Them Japs sure know how
to hold a grudge, don't they?

199
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,590
Or maybe...

200
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,510
...you just tend
to bring that out in people.

201
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,760
I know this is a ridiculous question
before I ask it,

202
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,310
but you haven't, by any chance,
kept up with your... swordplay?

203
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,230
I, um...

204
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,690
I pawned that years ago.

205
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:35,110
You hocked a Hattori Hanzo sword?

206
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,240
Yep.

207
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,320
It was priceless.

208
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,250
Well, not in El Paso, it ain't.

209
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,380
In El Paso, I got me $250 for it.

210
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,920
I'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill.

211
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,930
If she wants to fight with me, all she's
got to do is come to the club

212
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,850
and start some shit,
and we'll be in a fight.

213
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,270
I know we haven't spoken in some time,

214
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:15,150
and the last time we spoke
wasn't the most pleasant,

215
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:19,650
but you've got to get over
being mad at me,

216
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,910
and start becoming afraid of --,

217
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,580
because she is coming,
and she's coming to kill you.

218
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:31,210
And unless you accept my assistance,
I have no doubt she will succeed.

219
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:45,050
I don't dodge guilt, and I don't Jew
out of paying my comeuppance.

220
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,730
Can't we just... forget the past?

221
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,480
That woman...

222
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,780
...deserves her revenge.

223
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,200
And...

224
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,870
...we deserve to die.

225
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:14,580
But then again...

226
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,670
...so does she.

227
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,800
So I guess...

228
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,890
...we'll just see.

229
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,310
Won't we?

230
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,590
Late again.

231
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,850
Budd, can't you tell time?

232
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,850
There ain't nobody in here, man.

233
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,140
- Is that Budd?
- Yeah.

234
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,150
Tell him to get
his fucking ass back here!

235
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,020
OK.

236
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,690
Budd, Larry'd like a word with ya.

237
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,450
Take a hit.
Be somebody, baby.

238
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,550
You looking for me?

239
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,260
I don't know what car wash
you worked before you came here

240
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,770
that let you stroll in 20 minutes late,
but it wasn't owned by me

241
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,480
- and I own a fuckin' car wash.
- Do you want me to leave?

242
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,900
No, I don't want you to leave.
I want you to sit and wait.

243
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,900
Larry...

244
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,990
...there ain't nobody out there, so...

245
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,070
<i>"There's nobody
out there, Larry."</i>

246
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,580
What's your point?

247
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,370
- That you're not needed here?
- My point is...

248
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:23,000
...I'm the bouncer, and there
ain't nobody out there to bounce.

249
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,380
You're saying that the reason...

250
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,470
...that you're not doing the job that I'm...

251
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:35,020
...paying you to do is that
you don't have a job to do?

252
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,400
- No...
- Is that what you're saying?

253
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,520
What are you trying
to convince me of, exactly?

254
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,570
That you're as useless
as an asshole right here?

255
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,950
Well, guess what, buddy.

256
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:51,660
I think... you just fucking convinced me.

257
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,490
Let's go to the calendar.

258
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,750
It's calendar time.

259
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,370
Calendar time for Buddy.

260
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,920
- OK. You working tomorrow?
- Yeah.

261
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,090
Mm. No, you're n... You don't even know
what fucking day you work.

262
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,180
Here. You're not working tomorrow.

263
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,430
You're working Wednesday.
Here you are. There you go.

264
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,600
- Workin' Thursday?
- Yeah.

265
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,850
I don't think so.
Friday.

266
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,190
I d... There's your name.

267
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:25,150
- If you say so.
- There used to be your name. OK?

268
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,940
- Saturday. There used to be your name.
- Oh.

269
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,400
Uh, Monday...

270
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,570
Here. How about that?

271
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,580
Fuckin' with your cash is the only thing
you kids seem to understand. OK?

272
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,210
Now, I want you to go home till I call you.

273
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,710
Till I call you.

274
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:46,880
Before you leave, talk to Rocket.
She's got a job for you to do.

275
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,170
And...

276
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,890
...the hat.

277
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,850
That fuckin' hat.

278
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,310
That fucking...

279
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,730
How many times have I told you,

280
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:06,900
don't wear that fucking hat here?
How many?

281
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,910
Customers wear hats.

282
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,570
Well, I'm not the boss of the customers.

283
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,950
I'm the boss of you.
And I'm telling you...

284
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,210
...that I want you to keep
that shit-kicker hat at home.

285
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,200
Yeah. Budd, honey, uh,
the toilet is at it again.

286
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,210
There's shitty water all over the floor.

287
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:09,130
OK... Rocket.

288
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,970
- I'll clean it up.
- Mm-hmm.

289
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,730
Now...

290
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,270
...that gentled you down some, didn't it?

291
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,620
Yep.

292
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:14,790
Ain't nobody a badass with a double
dose of rock salt dug deep in their tits.

293
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,420
Not havin'... tits...

294
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,260
...as fine...

295
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,850
...or as big as yours,

296
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,520
I can't even imagine
how bad that shit must sting.

297
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,900
Yet...

298
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,820
...I don't want to, neither.

299
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,260
I win.

300
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,690
Ugh! Ugh.

301
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,750
Bill.

302
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,380
Wrong brother, ya hateful bitch.

303
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,090
<i>- Budd.
- Bingo.</i>

304
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,350
And to what do I owe
this dubious pleasure?

305
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,310
I just caught me the cowgirl
ain't never been caught.

306
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,780
<i>- Did you kill her?
- Well, not yet, I ain't.</i>

307
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,780
<i>I shot her full of rock salt.</i>

308
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,660
<i>She's so gentle right now, I could
perform her coup de grâce with a rock.</i>

309
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,490
Anywho...

310
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,380
Guess what I'm holdin'
in my hand right now?

311
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,460
What?

312
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,670
<i>A brand spankin' new
Hattori Hanzo sword.</i>

313
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:13,390
And I'm here to tell ya, Elle,

314
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:18,100
- ...that's what I call sharp.
- How much?

315
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,770
Oh, that's hard to say,
bein' that it's... priceless and all.

316
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,360
What's the terms?

317
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,530
<i>You get your bony ass down here
first thing in the morning...</i>

318
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,530
...with a million dollars in folding cash...

319
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:39,370
...and I'll give you the greatest sword
ever made by a man.

320
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,330
<i>Now, how do you like the sound of that?</i>

321
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,040
Sounds like we got a deal.

322
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:50,130
- One condition.
- What?

323
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:53,840
She must suffer to her last breath.

324
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:55,220
<i>Well...</i>

325
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,810
That, Elle darlin'...

326
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,430
...I can pretty much
damn well guarantee.

327
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,230
Then I'll see you
in the mornin', millionaire.

328
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,770
All right.

329
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,750
Wakey, wakey.

330
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,010
Eggs and bakey.

331
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,880
I'm done!

332
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,340
Get me outta this hole!

333
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,760
<i>Good.</i>

334
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,640
<i>Whew.</i>

335
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,630
Whoa, look at those eyes.

336
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,750
This bitch is furious.

337
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,720
What did I tell ya?

338
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,010
Is she the cutest little
blond pussy you ever saw?

339
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:48,310
Or... is she the cutest little
blond pussy you ever saw?

340
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,560
I seen better.

341
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,490
You got anything to say?

342
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,370
White women call this
"the silent treatment."

343
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,780
And we let 'em think we don't like it.

344
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,710
You grab the feet, I'll get the head.

345
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:23,430
Hey. Hey. Hey!

346
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,560
Wiggle worm, you see this?

347
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,850
You see it, don't ya?

348
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,690
That's a can of Mace.

349
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:37,650
Mm-hmm. No.

350
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,820
You're goin' underneath
the ground tonight.

351
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:44,660
And... that's all there is to it.

352
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,410
I wanna bury ya.

353
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,880
I was gonna bury ya...

354
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,970
...with this.

355
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,810
But if you're gonna
act like a horse's ass...

356
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:17,730
...I'm gonna spray this whole goddamn
can right in your eyeballs!

357
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,360
I'll burn 'em right outta your fuckin' head.

358
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:24,820
Then you're gonna be blind...

359
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:27,320
...and burnin'...

360
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,240
...and buried alive.

361
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,880
Now, what's it gonna be, sister?

362
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,270
That's a wise decision.

363
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,320
This is for breakin' my brother's heart.

364
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,010
Once upon a time...

365
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,640
...in China...

366
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:06,390
...some believe around the year...

367
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,310
...one double aught-three,

368
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,820
head priest of the White Lotus Clan,
Pai Mei, was walking down a road...

369
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,990
...contemplating whatever it is

370
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:26,000
that a man of Pai Mei's
infinite powers would contemplate -

371
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,330
which is another way
of saying, "Who knows?" -

372
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,800
when a Shaolin monk
appeared on the road,

373
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,630
traveling in the opposite direction.

374
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,140
As the monk and the priest
crossed paths...

375
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,180
...Pai Mei...

376
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:48,600
...in a practically unfathomable
display of generosity,

377
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,900
gave the monk the slightest of nods.

378
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,940
The nod...

379
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,950
...was not returned.

380
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:06,700
Now, was it the intention
of the Shaolin monk to insult Pai Mei?

381
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:13,000
Or did he just fail to see
the generous social gesture?

382
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:17,970
The motives of the monk
remain unknown.

383
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:20,130
What is known...

384
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,140
...were the consequences.

385
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:39,990
The next morning, Pai Mei
appeared at the Shaolin temple...

386
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,370
...and demanded
of the temple's head abbot

387
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:49,960
that he offer Pai Mei his neck
to repay the insult.

388
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:55,630
The abbot, at first,
tried to console Pai Mei.

389
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,720
Only to find Pai Mei was...

390
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,430
...inconsolable.

391
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,610
So began...

392
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:20,950
...the Massacre of the Shaolin Temple,
and all sixty of the monks inside,

393
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,110
at the fists of the White Lotus.

394
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:28,240
And... so began the legend...

395
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:33,000
...of Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

396
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,290
And what, pray tell,
is the Five-Point-Palm

397
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,000
- Exploding-Heart Technique?
- Quite simply,

398
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:42,260
the deadliest blow in all of martial arts.

399
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,010
He hits you with his fingertips...

400
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:52,060
...at five different pressure
points on your body...

401
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:55,060
...and then lets you walk away.

402
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:59,190
But once you've taken five steps...

403
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,280
...your heart explodes inside your body...

404
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,530
...and you fall to the floor, dead.

405
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,740
- Did he teach you that?
- No.

406
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:16,040
He teaches no one the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

407
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:18,750
Now...

408
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,510
...one of the things
I've always liked about you...

409
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,090
...Kiddo...

410
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,680
...is you appear
wise beyond your years.

411
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,440
So, allow me to impart
a word to the wise:

412
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,900
Whatever...

413
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:43,490
...whatever Pai Mei says, obey.

414
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:49,620
If you flash him, even for an instant,
a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.

415
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:54,910
And if you throw any
American sass his way...

416
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,250
...he'll snap your back and your neck
like they were twigs.

417
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:04,510
And that will be the story of you.

418
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,280
He'll accept you as his student.

419
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,450
- What happened to you?
- Nothin'.

420
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:32,370
- Get in a fight?
- Friendly contest.

421
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:34,120
Why did he accept me?

422
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,500
Because he's a very, very, very old man.

423
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,790
And like all rotten bastards...

424
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:45,470
...when they become old,
they get lonely.

425
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:50,010
Which has no effect
on their dispositions,

426
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:53,680
but it does teach them
the value of company.

427
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,520
Whew. Oh.

428
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,900
Just seein' those
steps again makes me ache.

429
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,360
You're gonna have a lot of fun

430
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,950
carrying buckets of water
up and down that fucker.

431
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,870
When will I see you again?

432
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:18,370
That's the title of my favorite
soul song of the seventies.

433
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,460
- What?
- Nothin'.

434
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:23,840
When he tells me you're done.

435
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,710
When do you think that might be?

436
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,720
That, my dearest,
depends entirely on you.

437
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,300
Now remember,
no sarcasm, no backtalk.

438
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:34,720
At least not for the first year or so.

439
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:38,060
You're gonna have to let him
warm up to you.

440
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:41,730
He hates Caucasians,
despises Americans,

441
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:44,860
and has nothing
but contempt for women.

442
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,610
So, in your case...
it might take a little while.

443
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:54,280
<i>- Adiós.</i>

444
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:03,160
A little.

445
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,690
Yes, he is.

446
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,280
I am proficient in Tiger-Crane Style,

447
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:43,660
and I am more than proficient in the
exquisite art of the Samurai sword.

448
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:47,450
No, please don't!

449
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,070
Yes!

450
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,240
Come on, you bitch.

451
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:10,620
OK, Pai Mei.

452
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:14,580
Here I come.

453
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:26,750
May I have a glass of water, please?

454
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:09,290
- So that's a Texas funeral?
- Yep.

455
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,330
I have to give it to ya, Budd.

456
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:15,380
That's a pretty fucked up way to die.

457
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:18,090
What's the name on the grave
she's buried under?

458
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,220
Paula...

459
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:24,300
...Schultz.

460
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,140
Can I look at the sword?

461
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:34,690
That's my money right there
in that red bag, isn't it?

462
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:36,650
It sure is.

463
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,150
Well then, it's your sword now.

464
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,050
What's that you said?

465
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:03,760
So this is a Hattori Hanzo sword.

466
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,930
That's a Hanzo sword, all right.

467
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:08,930
Bill tells me you once had
one of these of your own.

468
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:12,480
Yeah, once.

469
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:15,150
Yeah? How does this one
compare to that?

470
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:27,990
If you're gonna compare
a Hanzo sword...

471
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:33,250
...you compare it
to every other sword ever made -

472
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:37,540
wasn't made - by Hattori Hanzo.

473
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:49,470
Here you go.
Wrap your lips around that.

474
01:07:58,610 --> 01:08:00,610
So...

475
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,400
...which "R" are you filled with?

476
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:06,070
What?

477
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,700
They say...

478
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:13,410
...the number one killer...

479
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:15,330
...of old people...

480
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:17,000
...is retirement.

481
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:25,050
People got a job to do, they tend to live
a little bit longer so they can do it.

482
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:29,010
I've always figured that...

483
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,970
...warriors and their enemies...

484
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:34,850
...share the same relationship.

485
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:37,690
So now that you're not gonna have
to face your enemy no more

486
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:40,520
on the battlefield...

487
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,940
...which "R" ya filled with?

488
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:47,950
Relief...

489
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:52,790
...or regret?

490
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:58,210
- A little bit of both.
- Horseshit.

491
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,920
I'm sure you do feel a little bit of both.

492
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,470
But I know damn well that you feel one...

493
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:09,300
...more than you feel the other.

494
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:14,770
And the question was:
Which one is it?

495
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:17,100
Regret.

496
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:21,230
You know,
you gotta hand it to the ol' girl.

497
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:25,030
I never saw anybody buffalo Bill
the way she buffaloed Bill.

498
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:28,240
Bill thought she was so damn smart.

499
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,160
And I tried to tell him...

500
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:33,120
...she was just smart for a blond.

501
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:55,180
Thanks a bunch.

502
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:08,440
All right.

503
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,480
Mmm.

504
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,020
I'm sorry, Budd.

505
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,730
That was rude of me, wasn't it?

506
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:48,940
Budd, I'd like to introduce my friend,
the black mamba.

507
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:52,070
Black mamba, this is Budd.

508
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:54,570
You know, before I picked
that little fella up,

509
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,780
I looked him up on the Internet.

510
01:10:56,870 --> 01:11:00,160
Fascinating creature, the black mamba.

511
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:01,540
Listen to this:

512
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,050
"In Africa, the saying goes,

513
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:13,340
"'In the bush, an elephant can kill you,
a leopard can kill you,

514
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:17,510
"'and a black mamba can kill you.
But only with the mamba,

515
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,060
"and this has been true in Africa
since the dawn of time, is death sure.'

516
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:28,900
Hence its handle, 'Death Incarnate."'
Pretty cool, huh?

517
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:34,030
"Its neurotoxic venom is one of
nature's most effective poisons,

518
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:37,410
"acting on the nervous system,
causing paralysis.

519
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:41,040
"The venom of a black mamba
can kill a human being in four hours

520
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,870
"if, say, bitten on the ankle or the thumb.

521
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:47,290
"However, a bite to the face or torso

522
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:51,090
can bring death from paralysis
within 20 minutes."

523
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:54,470
Now, you should listen to this,
'cause this concerns you.

524
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:59,310
"The amount of venom that can be
delivered from a single bite

525
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:01,060
can be gargantuan."

526
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,980
You know, I've always liked
that word, "gargantuan."

527
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:08,900
I so rarely have an opportunity
to use it in a sentence.

528
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:11,320
"If not treated quickly with antivenom,

529
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,240
"ten to 15 milligrams
can be fatal to human beings.

530
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,740
"However, the black mamba can deliver

531
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:21,740
as much as 100 to 400 milligrams
of venom from a single bite."

532
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,670
Now...

533
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,170
...in these last agonizing
minutes of life you have left,

534
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:35,550
let me answer that question
you asked earlier more thoroughly.

535
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:41,350
Right at this moment...

536
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:45,230
...the biggest "R" I feel is regret.

537
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:53,230
Regret that maybe
the greatest warrior I have ever met

538
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:59,370
met her end at the hands
of a bushwhackin', scrub,

539
01:12:59,450 --> 01:13:02,540
alkie, piece of shit like you.

540
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:07,670
That woman deserved better.

541
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:52,920
Bill...

542
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:56,590
...I have some tragic news.

543
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,840
Your brother's dead.

544
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,510
I am so sorry, baby.

545
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,970
She put a black mamba in his camper.

546
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:09,600
I got her, sweetie.
She's dead.

547
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,900
Let me put it this way:

548
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:18,320
You ever start feeling sentimental,
go to Barstow, California.

549
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,320
When you get here, walk into a florist
and buy a bunch of flowers.

550
01:14:22,410 --> 01:14:25,330
Take those flowers
to Huntington Cemetery

551
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:29,580
on Fuller and Guadalupe, look for
the headstone marked "Paula Schultz,"

552
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:31,790
and lay them on the grave.

553
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:37,880
'Cause you will be standing at the final
resting place of Beatrix Kiddo.

554
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:40,420
- Marty Kitrosser?
- Here.

555
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:42,090
- Melanie Harrhouse?
- Here.

556
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:44,890
- Beatrix Kiddo?
- Here.

557
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:48,270
Look... I can be there
in about four hours.

558
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:50,100
Do you want me to come over?

559
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:53,900
No, no, no.
You need me, baby, I'm there.

560
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:59,820
OK. I'm leaving now.

561
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:03,110
You go smoke some pot or somethin'.
I'll be there soon.

562
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:06,390
Ugh.

563
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:07,970
Gross.

564
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,920
Hi-ya!

565
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:35,930
"To my brother, Budd.
The only man I ever loved. Bill."

566
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:49,070
What's that?

567
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,780
Budd's Hanzo sword.

568
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:56,370
He said he pawned it.

569
01:17:56,450 --> 01:18:00,080
Guess that makes him
a liar now, don't it?

570
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:06,420
- Elle?
- Bea.

571
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:10,340
Somethin' I've always
been curious about.

572
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:12,890
Just between us girls...

573
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:18,680
...what did you say to Pai Mei
to make him snatch out your eye?

574
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:21,440
<i>Ow!</i>

575
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:25,690
I called him a miserable old fool.

576
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:30,820
Ooh. Bad idea.

577
01:18:30,910 --> 01:18:32,700
Know what I did?

578
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:36,950
I killed that miserable old fool.

579
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:41,670
How do you like the fish head,
you miserable old fool?

580
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:44,290
<i>I poisoned his fish heads.</i>

581
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,310
<i>And I told him,</i>

582
01:18:56,390 --> 01:19:00,310
"To me, the word
of an old fool like you

583
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:03,020
is worth less than nothing."

584
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:04,400
is worth less than nothing."

585
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,150
That's right.

586
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,320
I killed your master.

587
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:16,030
And now I'm gonna kill you, too.

588
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,660
With your own sword, no less.

589
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:24,420
Which, in the very immediate future,
will become my sword.

590
01:19:27,090 --> 01:19:28,590
Bitch...

591
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:31,800
...you don't have a future.

592
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:22,470
Fucking bitch!

593
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:27,020
Fucking bitch!

594
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:39,620
I'll kill you!
You're fuckin' dead!

595
01:20:40,490 --> 01:20:44,410
You bitch! You bitch!

596
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:51,250
I'll fucking kill you, you bitch!

597
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,180
Oh, I'll get you!

598
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,850
I'm gonna...

599
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:04,220
<i>Where are you?
Lemme fuckin' at you!</i>

600
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:09,940
Where are you?
I'm coming, you fucking bitch!

601
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:12,860
You're fucking dead!
You're dead!

602
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:18,740
Oh... shit!

603
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:48,500
<i>Like most men
who never knew their father,</i>

604
01:22:48,580 --> 01:22:50,870
<i>Bill collected father figures.</i>

605
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,000
<i>The first was Esteban Vihaio.</i>

606
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:58,050
<i>Esteban was a pimp
and a friend of Bill's mother.</i>

607
01:22:58,130 --> 01:23:02,180
<i>He ran a brothel in Acuna, Mexico,
for over 50 years.</i>

608
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:04,720
<i>His army, the Acuna Boys,</i>

609
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:09,100
<i>made up of the fatherless offspring
of his whores, ran Acuna.</i>

610
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:11,520
<i>He ran the Acuna Boys.</i>

611
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:18,280
<i>Now, at the age of 80, it would be
this retired gentleman of leisure</i>

612
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:21,700
<i>who could point me in Bill's direction.</i>

613
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:25,530
Señor Esteban Vihaio?

614
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:28,740
Yes.

615
01:23:28,830 --> 01:23:30,830
May I join you?

616
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:36,090
Only on the condition
that you call me Esteban.

617
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:40,760
- May I join you, Esteban?
- Please.

618
01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:46,350
<i>Americana?</i>

619
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:48,140
Yes.

620
01:23:48,220 --> 01:23:51,020
I speak a little Spanish, if you prefer.

621
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:54,600
No, no, no, no.
I prefer English.

622
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:57,270
I haven't spoken it in a while,

623
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:00,690
but I would relish
the opportunity to converse

624
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:03,650
with such a pretty
companion as yourself.

625
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:08,080
It's my pleasure to be in the company
of such a fine gentleman as yourself.

626
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:10,950
I must warn you, young lady...

627
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:14,250
...I am susceptible to flattery.

628
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:19,290
How may I be of service to you?

629
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:29,390
Where's Bill?

630
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:34,020
Ahh.

631
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:36,520
You must be Beatrix.

632
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,730
I can see the attraction.

633
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:48,660
I remember when Bill was only
five years old, I took him to the movies.

634
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:52,410
It was a movie starring Lana Turner.

635
01:24:52,490 --> 01:24:56,710
<i>The Postman Always Ring Twice,
with John Garfields.</i>

636
01:24:57,670 --> 01:25:00,840
And whenever she would
appear on the screen,

637
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:06,470
Bill would begin compulsively to
suck his thumb to an obscene amount.

638
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:12,260
And I knew from this very moment,
this boy was a fool for blonds.

639
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:19,770
Mmm.

640
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:21,520
You know...

641
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:25,530
...being a fool for a woman
such as yourself...

642
01:25:25,610 --> 01:25:28,700
...is always the right thing to do.

643
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:35,870
If we had met when I was
back in business...

644
01:25:35,950 --> 01:25:39,960
...you would have been
my number one lady.

645
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:47,300
- Well, I'm flattered.
- You goddamn well better be.

646
01:25:48,930 --> 01:25:52,970
This... I heard you were driving a truck.

647
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:55,720
My Pussy Wagon died on me.

648
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,770
The Pussy died. Hmm.

649
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:05,360
Bill shot you in the head, no?

650
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,070
- Yes.
- Hmm.

651
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:12,280
I would have been much nicer.

652
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:14,790
I would have just cut your face.

653
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:19,500
You must forgive me.

654
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:22,380
Please... you have a drink with me.

655
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:27,510
Clara!

656
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:32,510
Coming.

657
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:37,600
<i>Dos añejo.</i>

658
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:51,530
<i>Gracias.</i>

659
01:26:56,740 --> 01:26:59,870
What were we talking about?

660
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:07,960
Bill.

661
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:13,800
- Where's Bill?
- Where's Bill?

662
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:15,640
Yeah. Hmm.

663
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:20,890
Bill is at the Villa Quatro,
on the road to Salina.

664
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:24,560
I will draw you a map.

665
01:27:25,980 --> 01:27:28,360
Bill is like a son to me.

666
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:33,990
- Do you know why I help you?
- No.

667
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:35,990
Because he would want me to.

668
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:39,160
Now, that I don't believe.

669
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:42,210
Ahh.

670
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:46,080
How else is he ever
going to see you again?

671
01:28:54,990 --> 01:28:56,570
Freeze, Mommy.

672
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:59,410
Bang, bang! Oh!

673
01:28:59,530 --> 01:29:00,910
Oh! She got us, B.B.

674
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:03,950
Mommy got us.
Oh, I'm dying!

675
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,080
I'm dying.

676
01:29:08,670 --> 01:29:12,250
Fall down, sweetheart.
Mommy shot us.

677
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:20,350
But little did Quickdraw Kiddo know
that little B.B. was only playing possum,

678
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:25,270
due to the fact that
she was impervious to bullets.

679
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:27,560
I am pervious to bullets, Mommy.

680
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:31,270
Hey, get back down there.
You're playing possum.

681
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:37,110
So, as the smirking killer
advanced on what she thought

682
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:42,830
was a bullet-ridden corpse,
that's when little B.B. fired.

683
01:29:44,490 --> 01:29:45,870
Bang, bang!

684
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:58,010
You're dead, Mommy.
So die.

685
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:00,140
Oh!

686
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:04,720
B.B.

687
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:11,900
Oh! B.B....

688
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:17,110
I should've known.

689
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:20,910
You are... the best.

690
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:31,290
Oh, Mommy.
Don't die.

691
01:30:31,370 --> 01:30:33,500
I was just playing.

692
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,430
I know.

693
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,440
I told her you were asleep...

694
01:30:57,530 --> 01:31:02,320
...but that one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.

695
01:31:02,410 --> 01:31:06,660
And she asked me, "If Mommy's
been asleep since I was born,

696
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:09,450
then how will she know what I look like?"

697
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:16,250
To which I replied, "Because
Mommy's been dreaming of you."

698
01:31:17,130 --> 01:31:19,130
That's what I said.

699
01:31:20,130 --> 01:31:23,470
Did you dream of me?
I dreamed of you.

700
01:31:23,550 --> 01:31:28,060
Every single night, baby.
Every single night.

701
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:32,480
I waited a long time
for you to wake up, Mommy.

702
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:45,820
Now, let me look at you.

703
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,660
Oh.

704
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:56,500
My, my, my,
what a pretty little girl you are.

705
01:31:56,590 --> 01:31:58,500
You're pretty too, Mommy.

706
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:08,140
Tell Mommy what you said
when I showed you her picture.

707
01:32:08,350 --> 01:32:09,600
Mnh-mnh.

708
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:12,180
- Come on, shy girl.
- Mnh-mnh.

709
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:14,940
Come on. You know what you said.

710
01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:18,480
Come on. Tell Mommy.
It'll make her feel good. Come on.

711
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:22,110
- Mnh-mnh.
- Yeah. Come on.

712
01:32:22,190 --> 01:32:24,320
I said... I said,

713
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:30,540
"You're the most beautifulest woman
I ever saw in the whole wide world."

714
01:32:32,370 --> 01:32:36,170
That's the truth.
That's what she said.

715
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:43,010
B.B., don't you think Mommy has the
prettiest hair in the whole wide world?

716
01:32:43,090 --> 01:32:48,260
- Yes, I do.
- Matter of fact, it's better than pretty.

717
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:53,100
- What's better than pretty?
- Mmm... Gorgeous.

718
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:59,060
Very good. Gorgeous.
Mommy is gorgeous.

719
01:33:00,110 --> 01:33:05,860
Hmm. You know, sweetie,
Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy.

720
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:08,820
Why, Daddy?
Were you being a bad daddy?

721
01:33:08,910 --> 01:33:12,240
I'm afraid I was.
I was a real bad daddy.

722
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:19,170
Our little girl learned about
life and death the other day.

723
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:23,460
Wanna tell Mommy about
what happened to Emilio?

724
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:27,430
I killed him.

725
01:33:28,430 --> 01:33:32,890
- Emilio was her goldfish.
- Emilio was my goldfish.

726
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:38,190
She came running into my room,
holding the fish in her hand and crying,

727
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:41,440
"Daddy. Daddy.
Emilio's dead."

728
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:46,860
And I said, "Really? That's so sad.

729
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:49,200
How did he die?"

730
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:52,620
- And what did you say?
- I stepped on him.

731
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:57,870
Actually, young lady, the words
you so strategically used were,

732
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:00,710
"I accidentally stepped on him."

733
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,800
To which I queried,

734
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:09,430
"And just how did your foot accidentally
find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?"

735
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:13,850
And she said, "No, no, no. Emilio was
on the carpet when I stepped on him."

736
01:34:13,930 --> 01:34:17,140
Mmm. The plot thickens.

737
01:34:17,850 --> 01:34:22,730
"And just how did Emilio
get on the carpet?"

738
01:34:22,810 --> 01:34:26,070
And, Mommy, you would've been
so proud of her.

739
01:34:28,530 --> 01:34:30,660
She didn't lie.

740
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:34,910
She said she took Emilio
out of his bowl...

741
01:34:34,990 --> 01:34:37,410
...and put him on the carpet.

742
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:43,210
And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet?

743
01:34:44,210 --> 01:34:46,090
Flapping.

744
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:51,090
- And then you stomped on him.
- Uh-huh.

745
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:53,720
And when you lifted up your foot...

746
01:34:54,850 --> 01:34:58,810
- ...what was Emilio doing then?
- Nothing.

747
01:34:58,890 --> 01:35:01,850
He stopped flapping, didn't he?

748
01:35:04,190 --> 01:35:05,980
She told me later...

749
01:35:06,780 --> 01:35:09,150
...that the second she lifted up her foot

750
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:13,450
and saw Emilio not flapping,
she knew what she had done.

751
01:35:13,530 --> 01:35:18,580
Is that not the perfect
visual image of life and death?

752
01:35:18,660 --> 01:35:24,000
A fish flapping on the carpet,
and a fish notflapping on the carpet.

753
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:31,720
So powerful, even a four-year-old
with no concept of life or death...

754
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,590
...knew what it meant.

755
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:38,470
- You loved Emilio, didn't you?
- Uh-huh.

756
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:41,480
Well... I love Mommy too.

757
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:45,310
But I did to Mommy
what you did to Emilio.

758
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:49,230
- You stomped on Mommy?
- Worse.

759
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:51,360
I shot Mommy.

760
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:54,610
Not pretend shooting
like we were just doing.

761
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:56,490
I shot her for real.

762
01:35:56,570 --> 01:35:59,040
Why? Did you want to see
what would happen?

763
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:03,670
No, I knew what would happen
to Mommy if I shot her.

764
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:08,380
What I didn't know was, when I shot
Mommy, what would happen to me.

765
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:12,300
- What happened?
- I was very sad.

766
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:16,550
And that's when I learned...

767
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:21,930
...some things, once you do,
they can never be undone.

768
01:36:24,940 --> 01:36:30,110
- What happened to Mommy?
- Why don't you ask Mommy?

769
01:36:30,190 --> 01:36:33,320
You OK, Mommy?
Does it hurt?

770
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,320
No, sweetie.

771
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:39,200
Doesn't hurt anymore.

772
01:36:45,290 --> 01:36:47,540
Did it make you sick?

773
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:52,710
No. It made me sleep.

774
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,880
That's why I haven't been with you. B.B.
I've been asleep.

775
01:36:55,970 --> 01:36:58,800
But you're awake now, Mommy. Right?

776
01:36:59,470 --> 01:37:02,770
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.

777
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:08,100
B.B., would you like Mommy to watch
a video with you before sleepy time?

778
01:37:08,190 --> 01:37:09,560
Uh-huh.

779
01:37:09,650 --> 01:37:13,150
Mommy, do you want to watch
a video with me before sleepy time?

780
01:37:13,230 --> 01:37:16,240
Oh, yeah!
I would love to.

781
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:19,030
<i>- Which one do you wanna watch?
- Shogun Assassin.</i>

782
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:21,530
No, B.B.
Shogun Assassin is too long.

783
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:25,710
- Mnh-mnh.
- No, it's not.

784
01:37:25,790 --> 01:37:30,500
Well, then, I'll leave you ladies to it.

785
01:37:37,010 --> 01:37:42,470
<i>When I was little,
my father was famous.</i>

786
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:46,770
<i>He was the greatest samurai
in the empire.</i>

787
01:37:46,850 --> 01:37:50,150
<i>And he was the shogun's decapitator.</i>

788
01:37:50,230 --> 01:37:55,280
<i>He cut off the heads of 131 lords.</i>

789
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:59,950
<i>My father would come home to Mother
and when he would see her,</i>

790
01:38:00,030 --> 01:38:02,780
<i>he would forget about the killings.</i>

791
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:07,960
<i>He wasn't scared of the shogun,
but the shogun was scared of him.</i>

792
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:10,710
<i>Maybe that was the problem.</i>

793
01:38:10,790 --> 01:38:13,670
<i>One night, the shogun sent...</i>

794
01:40:35,390 --> 01:40:38,310
I was just admiring your sword.

795
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,320
Quite a piece of work.

796
01:40:42,650 --> 01:40:46,660
Speaking of which, how is Hanzo-san?

797
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:48,200
He's good.

798
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:52,200
Has his sushi gotten any better?

799
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:01,090
You know, I couldn't believe it.
You got him to make you a sword.

800
01:41:01,170 --> 01:41:05,510
It was easy.
I just dropped your name, Bill.

801
01:41:05,590 --> 01:41:07,680
That'd do it.

802
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:44,210
I suppose the idea is we cross
Hanzo swords. Am I right?

803
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:47,840
Well,

804
01:41:47,930 --> 01:41:53,010
it just so happens this hacienda
has its own private beach.

805
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:57,440
And that private beach just so happens
to look particularly beautiful

806
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,190
bathed in moonlight.

807
01:42:00,520 --> 01:42:03,440
And there just so happens to be
a full moon out tonight.

808
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:10,110
So, swordfighter, if you want
a swordfight, that's where I suggest.

809
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:14,370
But if you wanna be old school about it...

810
01:42:14,450 --> 01:42:18,120
...and you know
I'm all about old school...

811
01:42:18,210 --> 01:42:21,880
...then we could wait until dawn
and slice each other up at sunrise

812
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:24,130
like a couple of real-life honest...

813
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:31,590
Now, if you don't settle down, I'm gonna
have to put one in your kneecap.

814
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:34,930
And I hear tell that's
a very painful place to get shot in.

815
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:41,480
I'm just fuckin' with you.

816
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:43,940
Now...

817
01:42:44,690 --> 01:42:47,280
...when it comes to you...

818
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:49,030
...and us...

819
01:42:50,990 --> 01:42:54,160
...I have a few unanswered questions.

820
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:59,790
So, before this tale of bloody revenge
reaches its climax,

821
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:05,380
I'm gonna ask you some questions,
and I want you to tell me the truth.

822
01:43:06,130 --> 01:43:09,130
However, therein lies a dilemma.

823
01:43:10,380 --> 01:43:12,970
Because when it comes
to the subject of me,

824
01:43:13,050 --> 01:43:18,270
I believe you are truly and utterly
incapable of telling the truth.

825
01:43:18,350 --> 01:43:22,900
Especially to me.
And least of all, to yourself.

826
01:43:22,980 --> 01:43:26,320
And when it comes to the subject of me,

827
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:33,110
I am truly and utterly incapable
of believing anything you say.

828
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:35,410
How do you suppose
we solve this dilemma?

829
01:43:35,490 --> 01:43:37,030
Well,

830
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:39,330
it just so happens,

831
01:43:39,410 --> 01:43:41,460
I have a solution.

832
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:44,000
- Aah!
- Gotcha!

833
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,290
<i>Goddamn!</i>

834
01:43:48,750 --> 01:43:52,170
What the fuck
did you just shoot me with?

835
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:56,010
My greatest invention.
Or at least my favorite.

836
01:43:56,680 --> 01:44:00,640
Don't touch it, or I'll stick another one
right in your cheek.

837
01:44:04,350 --> 01:44:10,610
What lies within that dart, just begging
to course its way through your veins...

838
01:44:10,690 --> 01:44:15,160
...is an incredibly potent
and quite infallible truth serum.

839
01:44:15,240 --> 01:44:18,240
I call it "The Undisputed Truth."

840
01:44:18,330 --> 01:44:22,870
Twice as strong as sodium pentothal,
with no druggie aftereffects.

841
01:44:23,910 --> 01:44:29,800
Except for a slight wave of euphoria.
You feel it?

842
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:32,420
- Euphoria?
- Yeah.

843
01:44:32,510 --> 01:44:35,890
- No.
- Too bad.

844
01:44:37,010 --> 01:44:39,180
As you know...

845
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:42,890
...I'm quite keen on comic books.

846
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:46,480
Especially the ones about superheroes.

847
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:52,190
I find the whole mythology
surrounding superheroes fascinating.

848
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:55,910
Take my favorite superhero, Superman.

849
01:44:56,950 --> 01:45:00,030
Not a great comic book.
Not particularly well drawn.

850
01:45:01,620 --> 01:45:02,620
Mmm.

851
01:45:03,410 --> 01:45:05,790
But the mythology...

852
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:09,290
The mythology is not only great,
it's unique.

853
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:13,590
How long does this shit take
to go into effect?

854
01:45:13,670 --> 01:45:17,550
About two minutes. Just long enough
for me to finish my point.

855
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:22,850
Now, a staple of the superhero
mythology is,

856
01:45:22,930 --> 01:45:25,890
there's the superhero
and there's the alter ego.

857
01:45:25,980 --> 01:45:30,270
Batman is actually Bruce Wayne,
Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker.

858
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:35,280
When that character wakes up
in the morning, he's Peter Parker.

859
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:39,870
He has to put on a costume
to become Spider-Man.

860
01:45:40,530 --> 01:45:46,410
And it is in that characteristic
Superman stands alone.

861
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:49,290
Superman didn't become Superman.

862
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:51,960
Superman was born Superman.

863
01:45:52,040 --> 01:45:55,550
When Superman wakes up
in the morning, he's Superman.

864
01:45:56,550 --> 01:45:59,140
His alter ego is Clark Kent.

865
01:46:00,010 --> 01:46:03,140
His outfit with the big red "S" -

866
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:06,930
that's the blanket he was wrapped in
as a baby when the Kents found him.

867
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:09,440
<i>Those are his clothes.</i>

868
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:15,230
What Kent wears - the glasses,
the business suit - that's the costume.

869
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:19,820
That's the costume Superman wears
to blend in with us.

870
01:46:21,490 --> 01:46:24,990
Clark Kent is how Superman views us.

871
01:46:25,080 --> 01:46:28,250
And what are the characteristics
of Clark Kent?

872
01:46:28,330 --> 01:46:29,870
He's weak...

873
01:46:30,830 --> 01:46:33,630
...he's unsure of himself...

874
01:46:33,710 --> 01:46:35,500
...he's a coward.

875
01:46:36,510 --> 01:46:41,590
Clark Kent is Superman's critique
on the whole human race.

876
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:48,020
Sort of like Beatrix Kiddo
and Mrs. Tommy Plimpton.

877
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:51,270
<i>Aso.</i>

878
01:46:51,350 --> 01:46:53,690
The point emerges.

879
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:58,860
You would've worn the costume
of Arlene Plimpton.

880
01:46:58,940 --> 01:47:01,820
But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.

881
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:07,950
And every morning when you woke up,
you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.

882
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:10,040
Oh, you can... take the needle out.

883
01:47:17,300 --> 01:47:19,630
Are you calling me a superhero?

884
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:21,220
I'm calling you a killer.

885
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:24,800
A natural born killer.

886
01:47:24,890 --> 01:47:28,560
You always have been,
and you always will be.

887
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:30,770
Moving to El Paso...

888
01:47:30,850 --> 01:47:34,230
...working in a used record store...

889
01:47:34,310 --> 01:47:36,980
...goin' to the movies with Tommy...

890
01:47:37,070 --> 01:47:38,530
...clipping coupons.

891
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:40,440
That's you...

892
01:47:40,530 --> 01:47:43,950
...trying to disguise yourself
as a worker bee.

893
01:47:44,030 --> 01:47:47,080
That's you tryin' to blend in with the hive.

894
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,290
But you're not a worker bee.

895
01:47:50,540 --> 01:47:53,250
You're a renegade killer bee.

896
01:47:53,330 --> 01:47:56,460
And no matter how much beer you drank
or barbecue you ate

897
01:47:56,540 --> 01:47:59,590
or how fat your ass got,

898
01:47:59,670 --> 01:48:03,590
nothing in the world
would ever change that.

899
01:48:05,970 --> 01:48:07,760
First question:

900
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:14,810
Did you really think your life in El Paso
was gonna work?

901
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:22,950
No!

902
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:29,540
But I would've had B.B.!

903
01:48:29,620 --> 01:48:32,200
Don't get me wrong.

904
01:48:32,290 --> 01:48:36,210
I think you would have been
a wonderful mother.

905
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:38,380
But you are a killer.

906
01:48:42,970 --> 01:48:45,630
All those people you killed to get to me...

907
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:48,300
...felt damn good, didn't they?

908
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:52,060
Yes.

909
01:48:52,980 --> 01:48:55,390
Every single one of them?

910
01:49:05,490 --> 01:49:07,320
Yes.

911
01:49:10,660 --> 01:49:13,200
That was the warmup round.

912
01:49:13,290 --> 01:49:17,960
Now comes the $64,000 question.

913
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:29,010
Why did you run away
from me with my baby?

914
01:49:32,850 --> 01:49:36,270
Do you remember the last assignment
you sent me on?

915
01:49:36,350 --> 01:49:38,060
Of course.

916
01:49:38,810 --> 01:49:40,860
Lisa Wong.

917
01:49:42,110 --> 01:49:44,900
The morning I left, I was sick.

918
01:49:46,450 --> 01:49:49,530
On the plane, I threw up.

919
01:49:50,870 --> 01:49:53,370
So I started thinking:

920
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:57,000
Maybe I was pregnant.

921
01:49:57,080 --> 01:50:02,420
"Easy to use. Remove cap and urinate
on the absorbent end for five seconds.

922
01:50:03,710 --> 01:50:06,220
"Accurate results in only 90 seconds.

923
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:09,760
You can read the results as soon as
the line appears in the window."

924
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:47,010
Fuck.

925
01:50:47,090 --> 01:50:49,300
<i>What I didn't know...</i>

926
01:50:49,380 --> 01:50:53,510
<i>...was that somewhere on my journey
I had been spotted.</i>

927
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:59,770
<i>With me in L.A., it didn't take Lisa Wong
long to send an assassin of her own.</i>

928
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:02,440
Hello, can I help you?

929
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:05,980
Hello, I'm Karen Kim.
I'm the hospitality manager of the hotel.

930
01:51:06,070 --> 01:51:08,070
I have a welcome gift
from the management.

931
01:51:08,150 --> 01:51:09,400
Oh, that's nice. Um...

932
01:51:10,780 --> 01:51:12,450
Can you just leave it by the door?

933
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:28,840
- You pretty good with that shotgun?
- Not that I have to be at this range,

934
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:30,800
but I'm a fuckin' surgeon
with this shotgun.

935
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:33,930
Well, guess what, bitch?
I'm better than Annie Oakley.

936
01:51:34,010 --> 01:51:37,390
- And I got you right in my sight.
- I could blow your fuckin' head off.

937
01:51:37,470 --> 01:51:41,640
Not before I put one
right between your eyes, so let's talk.

938
01:51:43,350 --> 01:51:45,150
Karen...

939
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:49,780
...I just found out...

940
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:51,700
...right now...

941
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:56,030
...not a moment before
you blew a hole through the door...

942
01:51:57,830 --> 01:52:02,080
- ...that I'm pregnant.
- What is this?

943
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:04,540
On the floor by the door...

944
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:08,300
...is a strip that says I'm pregnant.

945
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:09,550
Bullshit.

946
01:52:10,670 --> 01:52:14,220
Any other time
you'd be 100 percent right.

947
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:16,140
This time...

948
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:19,520
...you're 100 percent wrong.

949
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:24,480
I'm the deadliest woman in the world.

950
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:27,610
But right now...

951
01:52:27,690 --> 01:52:30,360
...I'm just scared shitless for my baby.

952
01:52:31,150 --> 01:52:32,820
Please.

953
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:36,740
Just look at the strip.

954
01:52:38,740 --> 01:52:40,540
Please.

955
01:52:41,830 --> 01:52:46,540
Stay where you are and don't move.

956
01:53:03,730 --> 01:53:05,690
I don't know what this fuckin' shit means.

957
01:53:05,770 --> 01:53:07,730
The box with the directions -
it's right there.

958
01:53:20,240 --> 01:53:22,040
"Easy to use.

959
01:53:22,120 --> 01:53:26,670
Remove the cap and urinate
on the absorbent end."

960
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:28,380
Blue means pregnant.

961
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:31,210
I'll read it myself, thank you.

962
01:53:39,010 --> 01:53:40,720
Oh, OK.

963
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:42,680
Say I were to believe you.
What then?

964
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:44,810
Just go home.

965
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:49,270
I'll do the same.

966
01:54:08,790 --> 01:54:10,460
Congratulations.

967
01:54:14,050 --> 01:54:16,840
<i>Before that strip turned blue...</i>

968
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:19,380
...I was a woman, I was your woman.

969
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:23,640
I was a killer who killed for you.

970
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:27,180
Before that strip turned blue,
I would've jumped a motorcycle

971
01:54:27,270 --> 01:54:29,310
onto a speeding train.

972
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:32,060
For you.

973
01:54:33,650 --> 01:54:37,070
But once that strip turned blue...

974
01:54:37,150 --> 01:54:40,530
...I could no longer do
any of those things.

975
01:54:40,610 --> 01:54:43,080
Not anymore.

976
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:45,540
Because I was gonna be a mother.

977
01:54:48,750 --> 01:54:50,670
Can you understand that?

978
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:55,420
Yes.

979
01:54:56,420 --> 01:54:58,630
But why didn't you...

980
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:01,010
...tell me then, instead of now?

981
01:55:02,010 --> 01:55:04,300
Once you knew, you'd claim her.

982
01:55:04,390 --> 01:55:06,350
And I didn't want that.

983
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:09,310
Not your decision to make.

984
01:55:09,390 --> 01:55:11,440
Yes.

985
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:14,860
But it's the right decision,
and I made it for my daughter.

986
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:19,570
She deserved to be born
with a clean slate.

987
01:55:20,570 --> 01:55:22,570
But with you...

988
01:55:22,660 --> 01:55:26,540
...she would've been born
into a world she shouldn't have.

989
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:30,460
I had to choose.

990
01:55:31,670 --> 01:55:33,670
I chose her.

991
01:55:36,130 --> 01:55:38,920
You know, five years ago,

992
01:55:39,010 --> 01:55:43,840
if I had to make a list of impossible
things that could never happen,

993
01:55:43,930 --> 01:55:49,060
you performing a coup de grâce on me
by bustin' a cap in my crown...

994
01:55:52,060 --> 01:55:54,690
...would've been right
at the top of the list.

995
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:58,440
I'd have been wrong, wouldn't I?

996
01:55:59,690 --> 01:56:01,530
I-I'm sorry.

997
01:56:01,610 --> 01:56:03,700
Was that a question?

998
01:56:05,030 --> 01:56:07,530
Of impossible things
that could never happen -

999
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:11,080
yes, in this instance
you would've been wrong.

1000
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:13,000
Well?

1001
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:16,630
When you never came back,

1002
01:56:16,710 --> 01:56:22,800
I naturally assumed Lisa Wong,
or somebody else, had killed you.

1003
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:26,180
Oh! And for the record...

1004
01:56:26,260 --> 01:56:30,430
...letting somebody think somebody
they love is dead when they're not

1005
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:32,390
is quite cruel.

1006
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:39,860
I mourned you for three months.

1007
01:56:40,650 --> 01:56:43,950
And in the third month of mourning you...

1008
01:56:45,070 --> 01:56:47,370
...I tracked you down.

1009
01:56:47,450 --> 01:56:49,660
I wasn't tryin' to track you down.

1010
01:56:49,740 --> 01:56:54,080
I was tryin' to track down
the fucking assholes I thought killed you.

1011
01:56:55,210 --> 01:56:57,080
So I find you...

1012
01:56:58,750 --> 01:57:01,000
...and what do I find?

1013
01:57:01,090 --> 01:57:04,340
Not only are you not dead...

1014
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:08,640
...you're getting married
to some fucking jerk.

1015
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:13,180
And you're pregnant.

1016
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:19,110
I overreacted.

1017
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:31,540
You overreacted?
Is that your explanation?

1018
01:57:31,620 --> 01:57:34,120
I didn't say I was gonna explain myself.

1019
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:36,500
I said I was gonna tell you the truth.

1020
01:57:36,580 --> 01:57:41,380
But if that's too cryptic, let's get literal.

1021
01:57:43,380 --> 01:57:45,050
I'm a killer.

1022
01:57:46,050 --> 01:57:48,550
I'm a murdering bastard.
You know that.

1023
01:57:49,470 --> 01:57:52,390
And there are consequences...

1024
01:57:52,470 --> 01:57:55,850
...to breaking the heart
of a murdering bastard.

1025
01:57:56,850 --> 01:57:59,350
You experienced some of them.

1026
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:06,610
Was my reaction really that surprising?

1027
01:58:06,700 --> 01:58:10,740
Yes. It was.

1028
01:58:12,700 --> 01:58:16,450
Could you do what you did?

1029
01:58:16,540 --> 01:58:18,580
Of course you could.

1030
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:26,880
But I never thought you would,
or could, do that to me.

1031
01:58:26,970 --> 01:58:29,890
I'm really sorry, Kiddo...

1032
01:58:29,970 --> 01:58:32,220
...but you thought wrong.

1033
01:58:38,390 --> 01:58:42,610
You and I have unfinished business.

1034
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:46,780
Baby... you ain't kiddin'.

1035
01:59:19,770 --> 01:59:25,270
Pai Mei taught you the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique?

1036
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:30,610
'Course he did.

1037
01:59:32,360 --> 01:59:34,490
Why didn't you tell me?

1038
01:59:38,250 --> 01:59:40,460
I don't know.

1039
01:59:42,710 --> 01:59:44,540
Because I'm...

1040
01:59:45,630 --> 01:59:47,800
...a bad person.

1041
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:50,510
No.

1042
01:59:52,470 --> 01:59:55,550
You're not a bad person.

1043
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:58,560
You're a terrific person.

1044
01:59:58,640 --> 02:00:01,980
You're my favorite person.

1045
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:06,110
But every once in a while...

1046
02:00:07,110 --> 02:00:09,070
...you can be a real cunt.

1047
02:00:28,670 --> 02:00:30,630
How do I look?

1048
02:00:46,190 --> 02:00:48,770
You look ready.

1049
02:02:35,420 --> 02:02:39,630
<i>Well, well, well.
If it ain't the little flower.</i>

1050
02:02:44,470 --> 02:02:47,930
<i>Good evening, Mr. and Mrs.
America and all the ships at sea.</i>

1051
02:02:48,020 --> 02:02:50,060
<i>Let's go to press. Flash.</i>

1052
02:02:50,150 --> 02:02:52,860
<i>Do you have a magpie in your home?</i>

1053
02:02:52,940 --> 02:02:55,280
<i>If you do, you are most fortunate.</i>

1054
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:58,950
<i>The magpie is the most
charming bird in all the world.</i>

1055
02:02:59,030 --> 02:03:01,570
<i>He is the best friend a farmer ever had.</i>

1056
02:03:01,660 --> 02:03:04,700
<i>Treat him gently.
Treat him kindly.</i>

1057
02:03:04,780 --> 02:03:09,290
<i>And always remember,
the magpie deserves your respect.</i>

1058
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:46,580
Thank you.

1059
02:03:47,830 --> 02:03:50,660
Thank you.
Thank you.

1060
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:54,080
Oh, thank you.

1061
02:03:56,290 --> 02:03:58,340
<i>Now, I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do.</i>

1062
02:03:58,420 --> 02:04:00,970
<i>I ain't got no headache.</i>

1063
02:04:01,050 --> 02:04:04,050
<i>Oh yes, you have, brother.</i>

1064
02:17:08,340 --> 02:17:10,170
<i>And, action!</i>

1065
02:17:13,010 --> 02:17:14,470
<i>Cut.</i>

1066
02:17:15,090 --> 02:17:17,180
Oh, come on.
Let's do it again.
