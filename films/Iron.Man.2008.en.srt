1
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,631
I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.

2
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,716
This is crazy. What did I do?

3
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,260
I feel like you're going to pull over
and snuff me.

4
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:34,762
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forrest!

5
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,055
We can talk, sir.

6
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,934
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
- No, you intimidate them.

7
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:43,187
Good God, you're a woman.
I honestly... I couldn't have called that.

8
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:45,731
I mean, I'd apologise,
but isn't that what we're going for here?

9
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,609
- I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.

10
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:50,444
You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.

11
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:53,322
I'm kind of having a hard time
not looking at you now.

12
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:56,200
Is that weird? Come on, it's okay, laugh.

13
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,078
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.

14
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:02,873
Is it true you went 12 for 12
with last year's <i>Maxim</i> cover models?

15
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:05,084
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.

16
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:06,627
March and I had a scheduling conflict,

17
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:09,630
but fortunately,
the Christmas cover was twins.

18
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:12,591
Anything else? You're kidding me
with the hand up, right?

19
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:16,554
- Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
- Yes. It's very cool.

20
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:21,475
All right.

21
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,686
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

22
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,354
Please, no gang signs.

23
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:27,023
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

24
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:30,067
Yeah, peace. I love peace.
I'd be out of a job with peace.

25
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:34,238
Come on. Hurry up. Just click it.
Don't change any settings. Just click it.

26
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,912
- What's going on?
- Contact left!

27
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,664
What have we got?

28
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,001
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

29
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,127
- Stay down!
- Yeah.

30
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:56,010
Son of a bitch!

31
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:00,473
- Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
- Stay here!

32
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,087
Whoa!

33
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:21,846
<i>Tony Stark.</i>

34
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,766
<i>Visionary. Genius.</i>

35
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,519
<i>American patriot.</i>

36
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,728
<i>Even from an early age,</i>

37
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:32,273
<i>the son of legendary
weapons developer Howard Stark</i>

38
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:35,943
<i>quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.</i>

39
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:39,447
<i>At age four,
he built his first circuit board.</i>

40
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,699
<i>At age six, his first engine.</i>

41
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:46,203
<i>And at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from MIT.</i>

42
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:49,582
<i>Then, the passing of a titan.</i>

43
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:54,086
<i>Howard Stark's lifelong friend
and ally, Obadiah Stane,</i>

44
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,590
<i>steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,</i>

45
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:01,135
<i>until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns</i>

46
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:04,597
<i>and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.</i>

47
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,015
<i>With the keys to the kingdom,</i>

00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:08,893
<i>Tony ushers in a new era

00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:13,022
<i>creating smarter weapons,

50
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:16,984
<i>Today, Tony Stark has changed

51
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,862
<i>by ensuring freedom

00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,490

<i>Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honour</i>

57
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:48,432
<i>to present this year's Apogee Award
to Mr Tony Stark.</i>

58
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:56,941
<i>Tony?</i>

59
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:11,872
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thanks for the save.

60
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:15,626
<i>This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.</i>

61
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,127
<i>This is wonderful.</i>

62
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,048
<i>Well, I'm not Tony Stark.</i>

63
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:28,055
<i>But if I were Tony,
I would tell you how honoured I feel</i>

64
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:33,102
<i>and what a joy it is
to receive this very prestigious award.</i>

65
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:34,979
<i>Tony, you know...</i>

66
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,983
<i>The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.</i>

67
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,442
<i>He's always working.</i>

68
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,948
Work it! Come on!

69
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:53,080
- We should just stay till the morning.
- You are unbelievable.

70
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,417
- Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
- Nobody roped me into anything!

71
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,585
- I'm so sorry.
- But they told me that

72
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,421
if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honoured.

73
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,423
Of course I'd be deeply honoured.
And it's you, that's great.

74
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,258
- So when do we do it?
- It's right here.

75
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:06,510
- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

76
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:07,886
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

77
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:10,306
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

78
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,974
I don't have any of those
floating around.

79
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,184
We're gonna let it ride!

80
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,354
Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.

81
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:18,564
Okay, you, too.

82
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,524
- I don't blow on a man's dice.
- Come on, honey bear.

83
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,152
There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

84
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,486
Two craps. Line away.

85
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,363
- That's what happens.
- Worse things have happened.

86
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:27,865
I think we're gonna be fine.
Colour me up, will you?

87
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:29,450
- This is where I exit.
- All right.

88
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,576
Tomorrow, don't be late.

89
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:31,827
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious!

90
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,203
I know, I know.

91
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:36,874
Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's. There you go.

92
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,547
Mr Stark! Excuse me, Mr Stark!

93
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:46,091
Christine Everhart,
<i>Vanity Fair</i> magazine.

94
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,259
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

95
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,886
- She's cute.
- She's all right?

96
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,012
- Hi.
- Hi.

97
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,014
- Yeah. Okay, go.
- It's okay?

98
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,891
You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.

99
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,852
- What do you say to that?
- Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

100
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,520
And what do you say
to your other nickname?

101
00:07:58,604 --> 00:07:59,772
"The Merchant of Death"?

102
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,398
That's not bad.

103
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:05,277
- Let me guess. Berkeley?
- Brown, actually.

104
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:07,905
Well, Ms Brown,

105
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,449
it's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.

106
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:13,243
I guarantee you, the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

107
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,537
I'll start making bricks and beams
for baby hospitals.

108
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:16,664
Rehearse that much?

109
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,415
Every night in front of the mirror
before bedtime.

110
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,876
- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you first-hand.

111
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,212
All I want is a serious answer.

112
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,506
Okay, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,

113
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,008
"Peace means having a bigger stick
than the other guy."

114
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:30,386
That's a great line
coming from the guy selling the sticks.

115
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,263
My father helped defeat the Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.

116
00:08:33,347 --> 00:08:35,933
A lot of people,
including your professors at Brown,

117
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,184
would call that being a hero.

118
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,436
And a lot of people
would also call that war profiteering.

119
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,689
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

120
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,524
by advancing medical technology

121
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,943
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

122
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,279
All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

123
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,783
You ever lose an hour of sleep
your whole life?

124
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,785
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.

125
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,634
<i>Good morning. It's 7:</i><i>00 a.m.</i>

126
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:14,388
<i>The weather in Malibu
is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.</i>

127
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,891
<i>The surf conditions are fair
with waist-to-shoulder high lines.</i>

128
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,477
<i>High tide will be at 10:</i><i>52 a.m.</i>

129
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:38,746
Tony?

130
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:41,540
Hey, Tony?

131
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,564
<i>You are not authorised
to access this area.</i>

132
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:08,400
- Jesus.
- That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

133
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,570
I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

134
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,405
and there's a car waiting for you outside

135
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:15,741
that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

136
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:19,578
- You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
- Indeed I am.

137
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:25,083
After all these years, Tony still has you
picking up the dry-cleaning.

138
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,545
I do anything and everything
that Mr Stark requires,

139
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,423
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

140
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:32,591
Will that be all?

141
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,109
Give me an exploded view.

142
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:54,446
<i>The compression in cylinder three
appears to be low.</i>

143
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,114
Log that.

144
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,954
- I'm gonna try again, right now.
- Please don't turn down my music.

145
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,080
I'll keep you posted.

146
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,915
You are supposed to be
halfway around the world right now.

147
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,334
- How'd she take it?
- Like a champ.

148
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:08,961
Why are you trying to hustle me
out of here?

149
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,754
Your flight was scheduled to leave
an hour and a half ago.

150
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,965
That's funny, I thought with it being
my plane and all,

151
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,591
that it would just wait for me
to get there.

152
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,426
Tony, I need to speak to you
about a couple things

153
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,594
before I get you out of the door.

154
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,972
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

155
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,223
if it departs before you arrive?

156
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,643
Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

157
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,353
Do you want it? Yes or no.

158
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,522
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

159
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,817
No. The Springs was actually
the neighbourhood in East Hampton

160
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,151
where he lived and worked,

161
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,778
- not "spring" like the season.
- So?

162
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:39,199
I think it's a fair example.
I think it's incredibly overpriced.

163
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,661
I need it. Buy it. Store it.

164
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,998
Okay.
The MIT commencement speech...

165
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,917
Is in June. Please, don't harangue me
about stuff that's way, way, down...

166
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:51,253
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

167
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,963
Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

168
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,423
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

169
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,508
What are you trying to get rid of me for?
What, you got plans?

170
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:59,011
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.

171
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,179
I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

172
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,764
- It's your birthday?
- Yes.

173
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,308
I knew that. Already?

174
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,936
Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

175
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,440
- Get yourself something nice from me.
- I already did.

176
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,984
- And?
- It was very nice.

177
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:17,487
- Yeah.
- Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr Stark.

178
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,282
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

179
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:24,494
Okay.

180
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:46,433
You're good.
I thought I lost you back there.

181
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:51,021
You did, sir.
I had to cut across Mulholland.

182
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:52,648
I got you. I got you.

183
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,191
What's wrong with you?

184
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,776
- What?
- Three hours.

185
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,028
I got caught doing a piece
for <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

186
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,072
For three hours. For three hours
you got me standing here.

187
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,699
Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.

188
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,327
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

189
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:15,963
- What you reading, platypus?
- Nothing.

190
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,256
Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.

191
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,093
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

192
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,594
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr Stark.

193
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:23,845
You don't need to apologise to me.
I'm your man.

194
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,013
Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...

195
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:26,431
- I'm just indifferent right now.
- Hot towel?

196
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:27,724
You don't respect yourself,

197
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,142
- so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.

198
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,602
I'm just your babysitter.

199
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:33,188
So, when you need
your diaper changed... Thank you.

200
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,440
Let me know
and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

201
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,192
Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?

202
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:38,652
- Thanks for reminding me.
- No, I'm not talking...

203
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,487
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

204
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,990
- You can't have sashimi without sake.
- You are constitutionally

205
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,533
incapable of being responsible.

206
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,285
It would be irresponsible not to drink.
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

207
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:48,453
Hot sake?

208
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:51,832
- Yes, two, please.
- No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.

209
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,291
That's what I'm talking about.

210
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,420
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

211
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,255
you know what I recognise?

212
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:03,552
I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

213
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,346
Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

214
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,516
No, no. You don't have to be like me!
But you're more than what you are.

215
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,476
Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

216
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,604
No! You can't be distracted right now!
Listen to me!

217
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,330
General.

218
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,959
Welcome, Mr Stark. We look forward
to your weapons presentation.

219
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:37,085
Thanks.

220
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,840
Is it better to be feared or respected?

221
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:45,052
I say, is it too much to ask for both?

222
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,930
With that in mind,
I humbly present the crown jewel

223
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,807
of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.

224
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:51,933
It's the first missile system

225
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,853
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

226
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:58,899
They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

227
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,984
I respectfully disagree.

228
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:05,072
I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.

229
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,533
That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

230
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,453
And it's worked out pretty well so far.

231
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,871
Find an excuse

232
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:16,291
to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

233
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,878
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

234
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:42,150
For your consideration, the Jericho.

235
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:54,788
I'll be throwing one of these in

236
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,873
with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

237
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:57,999
To peace!

238
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,753
- <i>Tony.</i>
- Obie, what are you doing up?

239
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:04,339
<i>I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How'd it go?</i>

240
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,258
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be
an early Christmas.

241
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:10,220
<i>Hey! Way to go, my boy!
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?</i>

242
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,763
Why aren't you wearing those pyjamas
I got you?

243
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:13,431
<i>Good night, Tony.</i>

244
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,269
- Hey, Tony.
- I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."

245
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,312
The "hum-drum-vee" is back there.

246
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:22,107
- Nice job.
- See you back at base.

247
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:52,107
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

248
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,259
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

249
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,631
What the hell did you do to me?

250
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,008
What I did?

251
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,053
What I did is to save your life.

252
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,974
I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,

253
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,850
and it's headed into your atrial septum.

254
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,353
Here, want to see?

255
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,856
I have a souvenir. Take a look.

256
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,736
I've seen many wounds like that
in my village.

257
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,239
We call them the walking dead

258
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,534
because it takes about a week
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

259
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,412
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet,

260
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,290
hooked up to a car battery,

261
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:46,293
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.

262
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:56,636
That's right. Smile.

263
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:02,475
We met once, you know,
at a technical conference in Bern.

264
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,562
- I don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.

265
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,982
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,

266
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:12,277
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

267
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,653
Where are we?

268
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,490
Come on, stand up. Stand up!

269
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,493
Just do as I do.

270
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,288
Come on, put your hands up.

271
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,458
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

272
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,960
Do you understand me? Do as I do.

273
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:53,651
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer

274
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:55,528
"in the history of America."

275
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,492
He is honoured.

276
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,788
He wants you to build the missile.

277
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,500
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

278
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:13,254
This one.

279
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,386
I refuse.

280
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,147
<i>Tony!</i>

281
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:23,491
He wants to know what you think.

282
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,244
I think you got a lot of my weapons.

283
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:39,340
He says they have everything you need
to build the Jericho missile.

284
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,093
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

285
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,974
He says for you
to start working immediately,

286
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,311
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

287
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,358
- No, he won't.
- No, he won't.

288
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:13,541
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.

289
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,711
But they will never find you
in these mountains.

290
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:22,050
Look, what you just saw,

291
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,969
that is your legacy, Stark.

292
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:29,974
Your life's work,
in the hands of those murderers.

293
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:32,352
Is that how you want to go out?

294
00:22:32,894 --> 00:22:37,857
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

295
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,151
Or are you going to
do something about it?

296
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:45,365
Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me, you, either way.

297
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,701
And if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.

298
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,119
Well, then,

299
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:53,831
this is a very important week for you,
isn't it?

300
00:22:56,626 --> 00:23:00,129
If this is going to be my work station,
I want it well-lit. I want these up.

301
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,424
I need welding gear.
I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.

302
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:05,760
I need a soldering station. I need
helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

303
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,846
I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets of precision tools.

304
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:24,612
- How many languages do you speak?
- A lot.

305
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:27,448
But apparently,
not enough for this place.

306
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:29,576
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

307
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:33,037
Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

308
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:38,501
- Who are these people?
- They are your loyal customers, sir.

309
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,212
They call themselves the Ten Rings.

310
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,098
You know, we might be more productive

311
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,976
if you include me
in the planning process.

312
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,778
Okay, we don't need this.

313
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:09,157
What is that?

314
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:12,994
That's palladium, 0.15 grammes.

315
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:17,081
We need at least 1 .6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11 ?

316
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:21,669
What's he doing?

317
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,546
Working.

318
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,601
Careful.
Careful, we only get one shot at this.

319
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,354
Relax. I have steady hands.

320
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:42,857
Why do you think you're still alive?

321
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:52,533
- What do I call you?
- My name is Yinsen.

322
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:55,411
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

323
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,164
Nice to meet you, too.

324
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,498
That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.

325
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:44,043
That's because
it's a miniaturised arc reactor.

326
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:47,171
I got a big one
powering my factory at home.

327
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,258
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.

328
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,009
But what could it generate?

329
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:56,639
If my math is right, and it always is,
three gigajoules per second.

330
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:59,600
That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.

331
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:02,770
Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.

332
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:15,116
- This is our ticket out of here.
- What is it?

333
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,161
Flatten them out and look.

334
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:21,789
Oh, wow.

335
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,419
Impressive.

336
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,405
Good.

337
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:57,158
Good roll. Good roll.

338
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,827
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

339
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:02,705
I'm from a small town called Gulmira.

340
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:06,250
- It's actually a nice place.
- Got a family?

341
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:10,963
Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.

342
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:13,341
And you, Stark?

343
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,680
- No.
- No?

344
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:24,018
So you're a man who has everything

345
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:26,103
and nothing.

346
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:14,819
It doesn't look anything like the picture.

347
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,404
Maybe it's been modified.

348
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:17,613
The tail is wrong.

349
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:18,739
It's just backwards.

350
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:05,703
Relax.

351
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:17,006
The bow and arrow

352
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,967
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

353
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,931
It allowed the great Genghis Khan

354
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:28,726
to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.

355
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:33,022
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great

356
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,735
and four times
the size of the Roman Empire.

357
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:42,698
But today,

358
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:46,953
whoever holds the latest Stark weapons

359
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,872
rules these lands.

360
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:53,542
And soon,

361
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,255
it will be my turn.

362
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,937
Why have you failed me?

363
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:15,481
We're working.

364
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,149
Diligently.

365
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,151
I let you live.

366
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,364
This is how you repay me?

367
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,367
It's very complex.

368
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:29,078
He's trying very hard.

369
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:30,454
On his knees.

370
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,794
You think I'm a fool?

371
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,879
I'll get the truth.

372
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:40,923
We're both working.

373
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:49,557
Open your mouth.

374
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,933
What does he want?

375
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:53,269
You think I'm a fool?

376
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:58,649
What's going on?

377
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,652
Tell me the truth.

378
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:03,362
He's building your Jericho.

379
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:08,784
What do you want? A delivery date?

380
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,460
I need him.

381
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,130
Good assistant.

382
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:29,930
You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

383
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:37,081
Okay? Can you move?

384
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,416
Okay, say it again.

385
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,002
41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps,

386
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:45,548
that's from the door,
fork right, 33 steps, turn right.

387
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,515
Where is Stark?

388
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,767
He was here a moment ago.

389
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:57,977
Go look for him.

390
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:16,287
Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!

391
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,414
Say something.
Say something back to him.

392
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,875
- He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
- Then speak Hungarian.

393
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:23,419
- Okay. I know.
- What do you know?

394
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,861
- How'd that work?
- Oh, my goodness.

395
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:50,905
- It worked all right.
- That's what I do.

396
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:53,574
- Let me finish this.
- Initialise the power sequence.

397
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:54,992
Okay.

398
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:57,244
- Now!
- Tell me. Tell me.

399
00:33:57,328 --> 00:34:00,915
Function 11.
Tell me when you see a progress bar.

400
00:34:01,332 --> 00:34:02,583
- It should be up right now.
- Yes.

401
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:03,792
Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.

402
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,419
- I have it.
- Press Control "I".

403
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:07,922
- "I." Got it.
- "I." "Enter." "I" and "Enter."

404
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,757
Come over here and button me up.

405
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,969
Okay. All right.

406
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:15,387
Every other hex bolt.

407
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:17,598
- They're coming!
- Nothing pretty, just get it done.

408
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,058
- Just get it done.
- They're coming.

409
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:23,771
Make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, okay?

410
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:25,606
We need more time.

411
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:27,816
Hey,

412
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:31,904
- I'm gonna go buy you some time.
- Stick to the plan!

413
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:33,989
Stick to the plan!

414
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,159
Yinsen!

415
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:32,292
- Yinsen!
- Watch out!

416
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:48,559
Stark.

417
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:51,979
Come on. We got to go.

418
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:55,607
Move for me, come on. We got a plan.
We're gonna stick to it.

419
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:57,609
This was always the plan, Stark.

420
00:37:58,068 --> 00:38:00,195
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

421
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:03,657
My family is dead.

422
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,702
I'm going to see them now, Stark.

423
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:10,622
It's okay.

424
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,669
I want this. I want this.

425
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:23,635
Thank you for saving me.

426
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:29,099
Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.

427
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,181
My turn.

428
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:53,744
Not bad.

429
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,027
Hey!

430
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:51,551
How was the "fun-vee"?

431
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,223
Next time, you ride with me, okay?

432
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,089
Watch it, coming up here.

433
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:34,177
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

434
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:45,814
Your eyes are red.
A few tears for your long-lost boss?

435
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:50,485
- Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
- Yeah, vacation's over.

436
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:53,363
Where to, sir?

437
00:42:53,447 --> 00:42:55,073
- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
- No.

438
00:42:55,157 --> 00:42:56,241
No? Tony, you have to

439
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:57,409
- go to the hospital.
- No is a complete answer.

440
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,369
- The doctor has to look at you.
- I don't have to do anything.

441
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:00,912
I've been in captivity for three months.

442
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:04,750
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

443
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:05,876
- and the other...
- That's enough of that.

444
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:08,462
...is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

445
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:09,629
- Call for a press conference?
- Yeah.

446
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:12,257
- What on earth for?
- Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.

447
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:26,480
Look at this!

448
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:29,524
Tony.

449
00:43:31,902 --> 00:43:34,738
- We were going to meet at the hospital.
- No, I'm fine.

450
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,198
Look at you!

451
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,367
- You had to have a burger, yeah?
- Well, come on.

452
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:41,912
- You get me one of those?
- There's only one left. I need it.

453
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:47,709
Hey, look who's here! Yeah!

454
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:54,549
- Miss Potts?
- Yes.

455
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:55,884
Can I speak to you for a moment?

456
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:59,596
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.

457
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,014
I'm not a reporter.

458
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,516
I'm Agent Phil Coulson,

459
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:04,351
with the Strategic Homeland
intervention, Enforcement

460
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:06,061
and Logistics Division.

461
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,855
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.

462
00:44:08,939 --> 00:44:13,401
You know, we've been approached
already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

463
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:17,113
We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

464
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:20,909
We need to debrief Mr Stark
about the circumstances of his escape.

465
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:24,246
- I'll put something in the book, shall I?
- Thank you.

466
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:31,628
Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

467
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:35,131
Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can see me, and I can...

468
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,425
A little less formal and...

469
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:44,975
- What's up with the love-in?
- Don't look at me.

470
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:47,102
I don't know what he's up to.

471
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,604
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

472
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:52,107
I never got to say goodbye to Dad.

473
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:55,110
I never got to say goodbye to my father.

474
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:00,198
There's questions
that I would have asked him.

475
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:03,326
I would have asked him how he felt
about what this company did.

476
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:07,706
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

477
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:12,919
Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

478
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:19,384
I saw young Americans killed

479
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:24,306
by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

480
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:27,100
And I saw

481
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:33,148
that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

482
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,150
- Mr Stark!
- Hey, Ben.

483
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:37,903
What happened over there?

484
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:42,449
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realise that I have more

485
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:46,912
to offer this world
than just making things that blow up.

486
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:50,498
<i>And that is why, effective immediately,
I am shutting down</i>

487
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:54,210
<i>the weapons manufacturing division
of Stark International</i>

488
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:58,340
<i>until such a time as I can decide
what the future of the company will be.</i>

489
00:45:58,423 --> 00:45:59,966
<i>I think we're gonna be selling
a lot of newspapers.</i>

490
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,885
<i>What direction it should take,
one that I'm comfortable with</i>

491
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:06,014
<i>and is consistent with the highest good
forth is country, as well.</i>

492
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:12,062
<i>What we should take away from this
is that Tony's back!</i>

493
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,856
<i>And he's healthier than ever.</i>

494
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,360
<i>We're going to have
a little internal discussion</i>

495
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,820
<i>and we'll get back to you
with the follow-up.</i>

496
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:25,283
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

497
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:39,047
Well, that... That went well.

498
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,549
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

499
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:43,927
Your head? What about my head?

500
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,055
What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

501
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,225
- Optimistically, 40 points.
- At minimum.

502
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,643
Yep.

503
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:55,230
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.

504
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,941
Obie, I just don't want a body count
to be our only legacy.

505
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:00,652
That's what we do. We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

506
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:01,903
It's my name on the side of the building.

507
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:04,572
And what we do
keeps the world from falling into chaos.

508
00:47:04,656 --> 00:47:06,616
Not based on what I saw.

509
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:08,910
We're not doing a good enough job.

510
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:10,203
We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

511
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:13,164
Like what?
You want us to make baby bottles?

512
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:17,419
I think we should take another look
into arc reactor technology.

513
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:21,840
Come on.
The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

514
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:25,301
Tony, come on. We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

515
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:28,513
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

516
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:32,267
The arc was never cost effective.
We knew that before we built it.

517
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,520
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

518
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:36,771
Maybe.

519
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,774
Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?

520
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:42,402
- Thirty years.
- That's what they say.

521
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,282
Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

522
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:50,577
- Never mind who told me. Show me.
- It's Rhodey or Pepper.

523
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,954
- I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

524
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,881
- Okay.
- Okay?

525
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:07,427
It works.

526
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:15,643
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team.
Do you understand?

527
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:18,980
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

528
00:48:19,064 --> 00:48:20,482
like your father and I.

529
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:22,358
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

530
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:24,027
- But if I had...
- Tony.

531
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:27,155
Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

532
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:29,949
- You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.

533
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:32,702
You gotta let me handle this.

534
00:48:32,786 --> 00:48:35,205
We're gonna have to play
a whole different kind of ball now.

535
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:37,123
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

536
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:40,460
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

537
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,504
<i>Stark Industries!</i>

538
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:45,423
<i>I've got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?</i>

539
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:46,674
<i>Sell, sell, sell!</i>

540
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,843
<i>Abandon ship!</i>

541
00:48:48,927 --> 00:48:52,305
<i>Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?</i>

542
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:58,603
<i>Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!</i>

543
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:04,192
<i>Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!</i>

544
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:07,529
<i>Pepper. How big are your hands?</i>

545
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:10,281
- What?
- <i>How big are your hands?</i>

546
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:13,243
- I don't understand why...
- <i>Get down here. I need you.</i>

547
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:21,709
Hey.

548
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,256
Let's see them. Show me your hands.

549
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:27,382
Let's see them.

550
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,759
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

551
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:33,221
I just need your help for a sec.

552
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:36,224
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

553
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,852
It was. It is now an antique.

554
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:42,480
This is what will be keeping me alive
for the foreseeable future.

555
00:49:42,564 --> 00:49:47,193
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

556
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:50,196
- Speed bump, what does that mean?
- It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

557
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,658
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

558
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:56,870
And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.

559
00:49:56,953 --> 00:49:58,580
It's fine.

560
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:01,457
- What do you want me to do?
- Put that on the table over there.

561
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,293
- That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my God!

562
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:07,672
I want you to reach in, and you're just
gonna gently lift the wire out.

563
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:10,550
- Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.

564
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:12,260
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

565
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:13,720
the socket wall or it goes "beep."

566
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:16,264
- What do you mean, "Operation"?
- It's just a game, never mind.

567
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:20,393
- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.
- Okay.

568
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:24,731
You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.

569
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:28,860
No, you're fine.
You're the most capable, qualified,

570
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:32,447
trustworthy person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.

571
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,700
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

572
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:38,453
- Okay, okay.
- I really need your help here.

573
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:39,662
Okay.

574
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,585
Oh, there's pus!

575
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:50,298
It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

576
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,300
- not from my body.
- It smells!

577
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:53,927
Yeah, it does.

578
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,971
The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?

579
00:50:57,055 --> 00:50:58,181
- Okay, I got it! I got it!
- Okay, you got it?

580
00:50:58,264 --> 00:51:01,184
Now, don't let it touch the sides
when you're coming out!

581
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,310
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

582
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:03,686
That's what
I was trying to tell you before.

583
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,939
Okay, now make sure
that when you pull it out, you don't...

584
00:51:06,022 --> 00:51:08,942
There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it. You just pulled it out.

585
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,193
- Oh, God!
- Okay, I was not expecting...

586
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:12,445
- Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
- Okay, what do I do?

587
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:13,571
What's wrong?

588
00:51:13,655 --> 00:51:14,822
Nothing,
I'm just going into cardiac arrest

589
00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:16,157
'cause you yanked it out like a trout...

590
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:19,202
- What? You said it was safe!
- We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

591
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,287
- You gotta switch it out really quick.
- Okay. Okay.

592
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:23,414
- Tony? It's going to be okay.
- What?

593
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:24,540
- Is it?
- It's gonna be okay.

594
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:27,293
- I'm gonna make this okay.
- Let's hope.

595
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:31,839
Okay, you're gonna attach that
to the base plate. Make sure you...

596
00:51:35,927 --> 00:51:39,472
Was that so hard? That was fun, right?
Here, I got it. I got it. Here.

597
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,683
Nice.

598
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:44,018
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.

599
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:45,353
You okay?

600
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:49,691
Don't ever, ever, ever,

601
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:52,777
ever ask me to do
anything like that ever again.

602
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,988
I don't have anyone but you.

603
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:01,661
Anyway...

604
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,420
- What do you want me to do with this?
- That?

605
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:12,588
Destroy it.

606
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:14,632
Incinerate it.

607
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,926
You don't want to keep it?

608
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:21,180
Pepper, I've been called many things.
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

609
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:25,435
- Will that be all, Mr Stark?
- That will be all, Miss Potts.

610
00:52:26,102 --> 00:52:27,854
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

611
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:29,856
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

612
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:33,151
That's my phone,
that's a picture of me and my dad.

613
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:36,154
Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.

614
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:46,581
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?

615
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:49,042
I'll tell you, in my experience,

616
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:53,880
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

617
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:55,506
his insight,

618
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:58,593
that ability to look
into a situation beyond the obvious

619
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:02,305
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgement.

620
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:05,391
Colonel?
Why not a pilot without the plane?

621
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:07,477
Look who fell out of the sky.
Mr Tony Stark.

622
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,479
- Hello, sir.
- Speaking of manned or unmanned,

623
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:11,439
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong

624
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:14,108
at spring break.
Just remember that, spring break, 1987.

625
00:53:14,192 --> 00:53:15,485
- That lovely lady you woke up with.
- Don't do that!

626
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:16,944
- What was his name?
- Don't do that.

627
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:18,112
- Was it Ivan?
- Don't do that.

628
00:53:18,196 --> 00:53:19,447
They'll believe it. Don't do that.

629
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,698
- Okay.
- Don't do that.

630
00:53:20,782 --> 00:53:23,743
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Give us a couple minutes, you guys.

631
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:28,331
- I'm surprised.
- Why?

632
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:31,125
I swear, I didn't expect to see you
walking around so soon.

633
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:33,086
I'm doing a little better than walking.

634
00:53:33,169 --> 00:53:34,629
- Really?
- Yeah.

635
00:53:35,338 --> 00:53:37,965
Rhodey, I'm working on something big.

636
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:41,094
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

637
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:44,764
You're about to make a whole
lot of people around here real happy,

638
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:47,892
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

639
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,560
that was a doozy.

640
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:54,440
This is not for the military. I'm not...
It's different.

641
00:53:54,524 --> 00:53:57,193
What? You're a humanitarian now
or something?

642
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:58,694
- I need you to listen to me.
- No.

643
00:53:58,778 --> 00:54:02,657
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

644
00:54:04,534 --> 00:54:06,119
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

645
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,249
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

646
00:54:11,332 --> 00:54:12,500
Thanks.

647
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:24,137
- Jarvis, you up?
- <i>For you, sir, always.</i>

648
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:28,307
I'd like to open a new project file,
index as Mark ll.

649
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:33,187
<i>Shall I store this on
the Stark Industries Central Database?</i>

650
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:35,898
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

651
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:38,818
Till further notice, why don't we just
keep everything on my private server?

652
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:41,612
<i>Working on a secret project,
are we, sir?</i>

653
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:48,661
I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.

654
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:53,291
Maybe in mine,
it can actually do some good.

655
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:39,253
Next. Up.

656
00:55:39,879 --> 00:55:42,798
Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here.
You got me?

657
00:55:42,882 --> 00:55:44,967
Stay put. Nice.

658
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:50,598
You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

659
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:53,226
Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

660
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,317
Up.

661
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:03,986
Screw it. Don't even move.

662
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:07,114
You are a tragedy.

663
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:19,585
<i>Okay, let's do this right.</i>

664
00:56:20,253 --> 00:56:23,089
<i>Start mark, half a metre,
and back and centre.</i>

665
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:28,052
<i>Dummy, look alive.
You're on standby for fire safety.</i>

666
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:29,554
You, roll it.

667
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:35,434
<i>Okay. Activate hand controls.</i>

668
00:56:39,772 --> 00:56:40,940
<i>We're gonna start off nice and easy.</i>

669
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:44,193
<i>We're gonna see if
10% thrust capacity achieves lift.</i>

670
00:56:44,277 --> 00:56:45,611
<i>And three,</i>

671
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:47,488
<i>two,</i>

672
00:56:48,281 --> 00:56:49,448
<i>one.</i>

673
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:28,821
Up two. All right, set that.

674
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:31,324
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

675
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:33,242
Yeah, everything's... What?

676
00:57:33,326 --> 00:57:34,493
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great!

677
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:36,579
- What would you like me to tell him?
- Great. I'll be right up.

678
00:57:37,038 --> 00:57:38,289
Okay.

679
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,875
I thought you said
you were done making weapons.

680
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,001
It is.

681
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:46,005
This is a flight stabiliser.
It's completely harmless.

682
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:51,302
I didn't expect that.

683
00:57:56,599 --> 00:57:58,017
How'd it go?

684
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:01,937
It went that bad, huh?

685
00:58:02,021 --> 00:58:04,690
Just because I brought pizza
back from New York

686
00:58:04,774 --> 00:58:08,653
- doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

687
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:11,614
It would have gone better
if you were there.

688
00:58:11,864 --> 00:58:13,407
You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

689
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:18,037
- I lay low, and you take care of all...
- Hey, come on. In public. The press.

690
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:23,250
- This was a board of directors meeting.
- This was a board of directors meeting?

691
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:26,796
They board is claiming
you have post traumatic stress.

692
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:28,005
They're filing an injunction.

693
00:58:28,089 --> 00:58:30,132
- A what?
- They want to lock you out.

694
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:31,425
Why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?

695
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:32,551
We knew that was gonna happen.

696
00:58:32,635 --> 00:58:34,679
- Fifty-six and a half.
- It doesn't matter.

697
00:58:34,762 --> 00:58:36,972
We own the controlling interest
in the company.

698
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:39,809
Tony, the board has rights, too.

699
00:58:40,685 --> 00:58:44,563
They're making the case
that you and your new direction

700
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:46,899
- isn't in the company's best interest.
- I'm being responsible!

701
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:49,985
That's a new direction for me,
for the company.

702
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:54,782
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

703
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:55,908
This is great.

704
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:59,453
- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
- I'll be in the shop.

705
00:58:59,537 --> 00:59:01,747
Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.

706
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:05,167
I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.

707
00:59:05,251 --> 00:59:06,836
Something to pitch them.

708
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:10,423
Let me have the engineers analyse that.
You know, draw up some specs.

709
00:59:10,506 --> 00:59:12,633
- No. No, absolutely not.
- It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

710
00:59:12,717 --> 00:59:14,301
- in New York!
- This one stays with me.

711
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:17,221
- That's it, Obie. Forget it.
- All right, well, this stays with me, then.

712
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:19,140
Go on, here, you can have a piece.

713
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:20,725
- Take two.
- Thank you.

714
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:22,685
You mind if I come down there
and see what you're doing?

715
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:24,395
Good night, Obie.

716
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:29,859
Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,

717
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:32,611
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

718
00:59:32,695 --> 00:59:35,531
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.

719
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:37,450
<i>All right, nice and easy.</i>

720
00:59:37,533 --> 00:59:42,455
<i>Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.</i>

721
00:59:43,956 --> 00:59:46,083
<i>And three, two, one.</i>

722
00:59:57,887 --> 00:59:58,929
Okay.

723
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:01,849
Please don't follow me around
with it, either,

724
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:04,351
'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

725
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:06,145
Just stand down!
If something happens, then come in.

726
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:08,481
And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

727
01:00:08,564 --> 01:00:10,149
Three, two, one.

728
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:29,335
Okay, this is where I don't want to be!

729
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:30,753
Not the car, not the car!

730
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:33,130
Table!

731
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:48,312
Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine! Okay.

732
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:07,915
No!

733
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,669
Yeah, I can fly.

734
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:19,385
- Jarvis, are you there?
- <i>At your service, sir.</i>

735
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:21,720
- Engage Heads Up Display.
- <i>Check.</i>

736
01:01:21,804 --> 01:01:23,848
Import all preferences
from home interface.

737
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:25,391
<i>Will do, sir.</i>

738
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:33,357
All right, what do you say?

739
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:36,902
<i>I have indeed been uploaded, sir.
We're online and ready.</i>

740
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,654
Can we start the virtual walk-around?

741
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:41,740
<i>Importing preferences
and calibrating virtual environment.</i>

742
01:01:41,824 --> 01:01:43,117
Do a check on control surfaces.

743
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,743
<i>As you wish.</i>

744
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:09,184
<i>Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.</i>

745
01:02:09,268 --> 01:02:12,187
Yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

746
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:13,772
Start listening in on ground control.

747
01:02:13,856 --> 01:02:14,940
<i>Sir, there are still terabytes</i>

748
01:02:15,024 --> 01:02:17,610
<i>of calculations needed
before an actual flight is...</i>

749
01:02:17,693 --> 01:02:21,614
Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run
before you can walk.

750
01:02:21,697 --> 01:02:25,993
Ready? In three, two, one.

751
01:02:49,308 --> 01:02:51,101
Handles like a dream.

752
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:20,798
All right, let's see what
this thing can do.

753
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:22,299
What's SR-71's record?

754
01:03:22,383 --> 01:03:26,178
<i>The altitude record for fixed wing flight
is 85,000 feet, sir.</i>

755
01:03:26,595 --> 01:03:29,264
Records are made to be broken!
Come on!

756
01:03:32,434 --> 01:03:36,063
<i>Sir, there is a potentially fatal
buildup of ice occurring.</i>

757
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:37,231
Keep going!

758
01:03:39,525 --> 01:03:40,859
Higher!

759
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:58,794
We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!

760
01:04:01,547 --> 01:04:03,882
Come on, we got to break the ice!

761
01:04:39,126 --> 01:04:40,419
Kill power.

762
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:08,006
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish
at plus 40 altitude.

763
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:12,511
Hull pressurisation is problematic.
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.

764
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:14,847
<i>A very astute observation, sir.</i>

765
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:16,682
<i>Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,</i>

766
01:06:16,765 --> 01:06:18,225
<i>we should improve the exosystems.</i>

767
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:20,894
Connect to the sys. co.
Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

768
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:24,064
Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

769
01:06:24,148 --> 01:06:28,026
That should ensure a fuselage integrity
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.

770
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:29,361
- Got it?
- <i>Yes.</i>

771
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:31,780
<i>Shall I render
using proposed specifications?</i>

772
01:06:31,864 --> 01:06:33,198
Thrill me.

773
01:06:34,575 --> 01:06:39,163
<i>Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right
here at the Disney Concert Hall,</i>

774
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:43,500
<i>where Tony Stark's third annual benefit
for the Firefighter's Family Fund</i>

775
01:06:43,584 --> 01:06:45,169
<i>has become the place to be
for L.A.'s high society.</i>

776
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:46,503
Jarvis, we get an invite for that?

777
01:06:46,587 --> 01:06:49,089
<i>I have no record of an invitation, sir.</i>

778
01:06:49,173 --> 01:06:50,632
<i>...hasn't been seen in public</i>

779
01:06:50,716 --> 01:06:54,428
<i>since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.</i>

780
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:57,306
<i>Some claim he's suffering
from post traumatic stress</i>

781
01:06:57,389 --> 01:07:01,018
<i>and has been bedridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,</i>

782
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:04,229
<i>no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.</i>

783
01:07:04,313 --> 01:07:06,481
<i>The render is complete.</i>

784
01:07:06,565 --> 01:07:08,233
A little ostentatious, don't you think?

785
01:07:08,317 --> 01:07:11,403
<i>What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.</i>

786
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:15,657
Tell you what.
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

787
01:07:15,741 --> 01:07:18,619
<i>Yes, that should help you
keep a low profile.</i>

788
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:23,707
<i>The render is complete.</i>

789
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:26,084
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.

790
01:07:26,168 --> 01:07:27,753
<i>Commencing automated assembly.</i>

791
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:31,006
<i>Estimated completion time is five hours.</i>

792
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:32,174
Don't wait up for me, honey.

793
01:07:56,406 --> 01:08:00,160
Weapons manufacturing is only
one small part of what Stark Industries

794
01:08:00,244 --> 01:08:03,997
is all about, and our partnership
with the fire and rescue community...

795
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:09,169
- Hey, Tony, remember me?
- Sure don't.

796
01:08:10,671 --> 01:08:12,172
You look great, Hef.

797
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:15,342
We're going to have a great quarter.

798
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:19,179
What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?

799
01:08:19,263 --> 01:08:23,475
Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.

800
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:25,310
I'll see you inside.

801
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:29,147
Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right?

802
01:08:29,231 --> 01:08:30,983
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

803
01:08:31,066 --> 01:08:34,653
You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

804
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:42,703
- Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
- Mr Stark?

805
01:08:43,412 --> 01:08:45,163
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.

806
01:08:45,664 --> 01:08:47,874
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

807
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:51,295
Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

808
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:53,005
God, you need a new name for that.

809
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:55,048
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

810
01:08:55,841 --> 01:08:59,678
Listen, I know this must be a trying time
for you, but we need to debrief you.

811
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,722
There's still
a lot of unanswered questions,

812
01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:03,682
and time can be a factor
with these things.

813
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:05,809
Let's just put something on the books.

814
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:09,229
How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m.
at Stark Industries?

815
01:09:09,604 --> 01:09:12,858
Tell you what.
You got it. You're absolutely right.

816
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:17,321
Well, I'm going to go to my assistant,
and we'll make a date.

817
01:09:18,739 --> 01:09:20,824
You look fantastic!
I didn't recognise you.

818
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:23,201
- What are you doing here?
- Just avoiding government agents.

819
01:09:23,285 --> 01:09:25,078
- Are you by yourself?
- Yes. Where'd you get that dress?

820
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:26,997
- Oh, it was a birthday present.
- That's great.

821
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,207
- From you, actually.
- Well, I got great taste.

822
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:30,542
Yes.

823
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:32,502
- You want to dance?
- Oh, no.

824
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:35,130
- All right, come on.
- Thank you. No.

825
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,768
Am I making you uncomfortable?

826
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:53,440
No. No. I always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss

827
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:57,361
in front of everyone that I work with
in a dress with no back.

828
01:09:57,611 --> 01:10:00,197
- You look great and you smell great.
- Oh, God.

829
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,157
But I could fire you if that would
take the edge off.

830
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,869
I actually don't think that
you could tie your shoes without me.

831
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:07,412
- I'd make it a week. Sure.
- Really?

832
01:10:07,496 --> 01:10:09,998
What's your Social Security number?

833
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:15,212
- Five.
- Five?

834
01:10:16,046 --> 01:10:17,381
- Right.
- Right.

835
01:10:17,464 --> 01:10:19,800
You're missing just
a couple of digits there.

836
01:10:19,883 --> 01:10:23,053
The other eight?
So I got you for the other eight.

837
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:38,735
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.

838
01:10:40,654 --> 01:10:42,572
- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless.

839
01:10:42,656 --> 01:10:45,492
It was totally not harmless, by the way.

840
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,993
We're dancing. No one's even watching.

841
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:48,870
Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?

842
01:10:48,954 --> 01:10:52,082
I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just... People... We just danced.

843
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:55,585
No, it was not just a dance. You don't
understand because you're you.

844
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:58,463
And everybody knows
exactly who you are

845
01:10:58,547 --> 01:11:01,758
and how you are with girls
and all of that, which is completely fine.

846
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:04,261
But, you know, then me, you're my boss,

847
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:06,388
- and I'm dancing with you.
- I don't think it was taken that way.

848
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:09,266
Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...

849
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:11,351
- I just think you're overstating it.
- You know, and we're here,

850
01:11:11,435 --> 01:11:15,105
and then I'm wearing this ridiculous

851
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:17,941
dress, and then we were dancing
like that and...

852
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:34,791
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it, okay.

853
01:11:36,168 --> 01:11:39,129
- I would like a vodka martini, please.
- Okay.

854
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:43,884
Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.

855
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:47,804
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

856
01:11:47,888 --> 01:11:50,056
Make one of them dirty, will you?

857
01:11:54,686 --> 01:11:57,314
Wow. Tony Stark.

858
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:59,983
- Oh, hey.
- Fancy seeing you here.

859
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:05,030
- Carrie.
- Christine.

860
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:06,156
That's right.

861
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,867
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

862
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:10,327
Can I at least get a reaction from you?

863
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,871
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.

864
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:14,331
'Cause I was referring
to your company's

865
01:12:14,414 --> 01:12:15,749
involvement in this latest atrocity.

866
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:18,627
Yeah. They just put my name on the
invitation. I don't know what to tell you.

867
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:20,837
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

868
01:12:20,921 --> 01:12:23,298
I was out of town for a couple months,
in case you didn't hear.

869
01:12:23,381 --> 01:12:25,675
Is this what you call accountability?

870
01:12:25,759 --> 01:12:28,512
It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?

871
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:42,484
- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.

872
01:12:42,943 --> 01:12:44,986
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.

873
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:47,030
Well, I'm not my company.

874
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:51,368
- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?

875
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:52,827
- What's going on in Gulmira?
- Tony, Tony.

876
01:12:52,911 --> 01:12:56,206
- You can't afford to be this naive.
- You know what? I was naive before,

877
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,166
when they said,
"Here's the line. We don't cross it.

878
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,626
"This is how we do business."

879
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:02,879
If we're double-dealing under the table...
Are we?

880
01:13:03,338 --> 01:13:05,465
Tony, your picture, please!

881
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:11,221
Let's take a picture. Come on.
Picture time!

882
01:13:12,973 --> 01:13:16,101
Tony. Who do you think locked you out?

883
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:20,105
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

884
01:13:22,566 --> 01:13:25,277
It was the only way I could protect you.

885
01:13:27,654 --> 01:13:28,905
No. No.

886
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:41,251
<i>The 15-mile hike to the outskirts
of Gulmira can only be described</i>

887
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:45,005
<i>as a descent into hell,
into a modern day</i> Heart of Darkness.

888
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:48,091
<i>Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages</i>

889
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,926
<i>have been driven from their homes,</i>

890
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:54,264
<i>displaced from their lands by warlords
emboldened by a new-found power.</i>

891
01:13:54,556 --> 01:13:57,601
<i>Villagers have been forced to take
shelter in whatever crude dwellings</i>

892
01:13:57,684 --> 01:14:00,437
<i>they can find in the ruins
of other villages,</i>

893
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:04,399
<i>or here in the remnants
of an old Soviet smelting plant.</i>

894
01:14:09,154 --> 01:14:12,574
<i>Recent violence has been attributed
to a group of foreign fighters</i>

895
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:15,368
<i>referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.</i>

896
01:14:15,619 --> 01:14:18,955
<i>As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.</i>

897
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:23,168
<i>A mission that could prove fatal
to anyone who stands in their way.</i>

898
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:25,962
<i>With no political will
or international pressure,</i>

899
01:14:26,046 --> 01:14:28,465
<i>there's very little hope
for these refugees.</i>

900
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:31,843
<i>Around me, a woman begging for news
on her husband,</i>

901
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:33,720
<i>who was kidnapped by insurgents,</i>

902
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:36,348
<i>either forced to join their militia...</i>

903
01:14:37,349 --> 01:14:39,976
<i>Desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,</i>

904
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,646
<i>holding them up to anyone
who will stop.</i>

905
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:46,358
<i>A child's simple question,
"Where are my mother and father?"</i>

906
01:14:47,984 --> 01:14:50,403
<i>There's very little hope
for these refugees,</i>

907
01:14:50,487 --> 01:14:54,324
<i>refugees who can only wonder who,
if anyone, will help.</i>

908
01:16:27,292 --> 01:16:28,501
Hurry it up.

909
01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:29,794
Put the women in the trucks.

910
01:16:29,878 --> 01:16:30,920
Stack the weapons here.

911
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:32,046
Clear all the houses.

912
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:33,798
That one there.
Faster. Faster.

913
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:42,974
Grab that dog.

914
01:16:45,894 --> 01:16:47,979
Put him with the others.

915
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:00,200
What the hell is this?

916
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,713
Shoot this dog.

917
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,465
You're all incompetent.

918
01:17:18,802 --> 01:17:19,844
Turn your head.

919
01:18:26,578 --> 01:18:28,329
<i>He's all yours.</i>

920
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:29,098
What the hell was that?
Were we cleared to go in there?

921
01:19:29,182 --> 01:19:31,851
No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.

922
01:19:31,935 --> 01:19:33,686
Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.

923
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:34,854
Get those monitors up!

924
01:19:34,938 --> 01:19:36,272
We got a bogey!

925
01:19:36,356 --> 01:19:38,483
- Wasn't Air Force!
- We got the CIA on the line?

926
01:19:38,566 --> 01:19:40,526
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

927
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:42,278
No, it definitely is not us, sir!

928
01:19:42,362 --> 01:19:44,030
- It wasn't Navy.
- Wasn't Marines.

929
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:46,616
I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?

930
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:48,952
- Negative, negative.
- Cannot identify.

931
01:19:49,035 --> 01:19:51,663
Get me Colonel Rhodes from
Weapons Development down here now!

932
01:19:58,461 --> 01:20:00,254
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

933
01:20:00,338 --> 01:20:02,048
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

934
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:04,342
Any high altitude surveillance
in the region?

935
01:20:04,425 --> 01:20:06,135
We got an AWAC
and a Global Hawk in the area.

936
01:20:06,219 --> 01:20:07,887
So this thing just appeared
out of nowhere?

937
01:20:07,971 --> 01:20:09,305
How come it didn't show up
on the radar?

938
01:20:09,389 --> 01:20:11,391
Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.

939
01:20:11,474 --> 01:20:13,643
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir, it's tiny.

940
01:20:13,768 --> 01:20:16,104
We think it's an unmanned
aerial vehicle.

941
01:20:16,187 --> 01:20:17,981
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

942
01:20:20,525 --> 01:20:23,486
- Let me make a call.
- Sergeant, clear a hole.

943
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:28,866
- Hello?
- Tony?

944
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:30,660
- <i>Who's this?</i>
- It's Rhodes.

945
01:20:30,952 --> 01:20:32,996
- Sorry, hello?
- <i>I said it's Rhodes.</i>

946
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:35,999
- Speak up, please.
- What in the hell is that noise?

947
01:20:36,082 --> 01:20:39,502
- Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
- Yeah, well, I need your help right now.

948
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:41,004
<i>It's funny how that works, huh?</i>

949
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:44,465
Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up

950
01:20:44,549 --> 01:20:46,175
a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.

951
01:20:46,259 --> 01:20:47,927
<i>Well, that's a hot spot.</i>

952
01:20:48,011 --> 01:20:50,513
<i>Sounds like someone stepped in
and did your job for you, huh?</i>

953
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:51,681
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

954
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:52,974
<i>I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.</i>

955
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,851
- I thought you were driving.
- <i>Right, I was driving</i>

956
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:56,686
<i>to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.</i>

957
01:20:56,769 --> 01:20:59,147
You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

958
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:00,690
- <i>Nope!</i>
- Bogey spotted!

959
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:03,526
- Whiplash, come in hot.
- Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one

960
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:07,030
right now, and it's about to be blown
to kingdom come.

961
01:21:07,697 --> 01:21:09,449
That's my exit.

962
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:17,623
<i>Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sights.</i>

963
01:21:17,832 --> 01:21:19,292
Whiplash One, what is it?

964
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:20,710
<i>I've got no idea.</i>

965
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:23,129
- You have radio contact?
- <i>Non responsive, sir.</i>

966
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,255
Then you are clear to engage.

967
01:21:26,299 --> 01:21:27,341
<i>Hit it.</i>

968
01:21:32,138 --> 01:21:35,141
<i>That bogey just went supersonic.
I got a lock!</i>

969
01:21:39,145 --> 01:21:41,147
- <i>Inbound missile.</i>
- Flares!

970
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:46,778
<i>Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!</i>

971
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:02,293
Deploy flaps!

972
01:22:03,503 --> 01:22:04,754
Holy!

973
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:06,422
That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.

974
01:22:06,506 --> 01:22:08,049
The sat visual has been lost.

975
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:09,801
<i>No way that's a UAV.</i>

976
01:22:09,884 --> 01:22:11,010
What is it?

977
01:22:11,094 --> 01:22:12,678
I can't see anything.

978
01:22:12,762 --> 01:22:15,223
<i>Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.</i>

979
01:22:15,723 --> 01:22:18,309
<i>I think bogey's been handled, sir.</i>

980
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:29,403
- Hello?
- Hi, <i>Rhodey, it's me.</i>

981
01:22:29,487 --> 01:22:31,155
- It's who?
- I'm sorry, it is me.</i>

982
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:32,532
<i>You asked.
What you were asking about is me.</i>

983
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:34,117
No, see, this isn't a game.

984
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,495
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.

985
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:39,497
- You understand that?
- This is not a piece of equipment.

986
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:42,375
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

987
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,877
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

988
01:22:46,045 --> 01:22:49,465
<i>-Mark your position and return to base.
- Roger that, Ballroom.</i>

989
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:52,802
<i>On your belly!</i>

990
01:22:52,885 --> 01:22:54,804
<i>It looks like a man!</i>

991
01:22:54,971 --> 01:22:57,640
<i>Shake him off! Roll! Roll!</i>

992
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:06,858
<i>I'm hit! I'm hit!</i>

993
01:23:06,941 --> 01:23:09,235
It's confirmed. He has been hit.

994
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:15,366
<i>Punch out! Punch out!</i>

995
01:23:21,789 --> 01:23:23,541
<i>Whiplash One down.</i>

996
01:23:23,624 --> 01:23:25,168
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?

997
01:23:25,251 --> 01:23:27,503
<i>Negative! No chute, no chute!</i>

998
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:34,427
<i>My chute's jammed!</i>

999
01:23:40,433 --> 01:23:42,810
<i>Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.</i>

1000
01:23:42,894 --> 01:23:45,521
Whiplash Two, reengage.
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

1001
01:23:48,024 --> 01:23:49,859
Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

1002
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:52,028
- Call off the Raptors.
- That thing just took out an F-22

1003
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:53,487
inside a legal no fly zone!

1004
01:23:53,571 --> 01:23:55,865
Whiplash Two,
if you have a clear shot, take it!

1005
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:58,367
<i>You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive manoeuvre.</i>

1006
01:23:58,451 --> 01:23:59,785
Keep going!

1007
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:09,420
<i>Good chute! Good chute!</i>

1008
01:24:17,053 --> 01:24:19,889
- Tony, you still there?
- <i>Hey, thanks.</i>

1009
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:22,558
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.

1010
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:24,810
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

1011
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:29,065
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.

1012
01:24:29,148 --> 01:24:30,816
<i>Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?</i>

1013
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:33,736
No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

1014
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:35,404
Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?

1015
01:24:35,488 --> 01:24:37,990
<i>Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?</i>

1016
01:24:38,074 --> 01:24:39,700
<i>It's not that simple.</i>

1017
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:42,411
An unfortunate training exercise

1018
01:24:42,495 --> 01:24:45,414
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

1019
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:49,543
I am pleased to report
that the pilot was not injured.

1020
01:24:49,627 --> 01:24:53,547
<i>As for the unexpected turn of events
on the ground in Gulmira,</i>

1021
01:24:53,631 --> 01:24:57,134
<i>it is still unclear
who or what intervened,</i>

1022
01:24:57,218 --> 01:25:01,347
<i>but I can assure you that the United
States government was not involved.</i>

1023
01:25:03,391 --> 01:25:04,475
Hey!

1024
01:25:06,394 --> 01:25:08,271
<i>It is a tight fit, sir.</i>

1025
01:25:09,272 --> 01:25:12,149
<i>Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.</i>

1026
01:25:12,233 --> 01:25:14,151
Be gentle. This is my first time.

1027
01:25:15,069 --> 01:25:17,863
I designed this to come off, so... Hey.

1028
01:25:19,115 --> 01:25:22,868
- I really should be able to...
- <i>Please, try not to move, sir.</i>

1029
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:26,747
What's going on here?

1030
01:25:31,294 --> 01:25:35,339
Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

1031
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:37,800
Are those bullet holes?

1032
01:26:05,244 --> 01:26:06,495
Welcome.

1033
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:11,959
Compliments of Tony Stark.

1034
01:26:12,877 --> 01:26:16,547
If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

1035
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:18,716
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

1036
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:20,551
Show me the weapon.

1037
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:25,264
Come. Leave your guards outside.

1038
01:26:42,031 --> 01:26:44,575
His escape bore unexpected fruit.

1039
01:26:47,244 --> 01:26:49,205
So this is how he did it.

1040
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:52,041
This is only a first, crude effort.

1041
01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:54,543
Stark has perfected his design.

1042
01:26:55,002 --> 01:26:57,505
He has made a masterpiece of death.

1043
01:26:58,172 --> 01:27:01,342
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

1044
01:27:02,927 --> 01:27:05,262
And you dream of Stark's throne.

1045
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:09,308
We have a common enemy.

1046
01:27:13,604 --> 01:27:15,564
If we are still in business,

1047
01:27:18,109 --> 01:27:20,319
I will give you these designs

1048
01:27:21,821 --> 01:27:22,863
as a gift.

1049
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:25,908
And in turn,

1050
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:32,665
I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.

1051
01:27:43,634 --> 01:27:46,595
This is the only gift you shall receive.

1052
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:50,975
Technology.

1053
01:27:52,852 --> 01:27:56,397
It's always been your Achilles'' heel
in this part of the world.

1054
01:27:57,606 --> 01:28:00,776
Don't worry. It'll only last for 15 minutes.

1055
01:28:01,944 --> 01:28:04,405
That's the least of your problems.

1056
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:12,288
Crate up the arm our and the rest of it.

1057
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:15,958
All right, let's finish up here.

1058
01:28:19,879 --> 01:28:22,840
Set up Sector 16
underneath the arc reactor,

1059
01:28:22,923 --> 01:28:26,469
and I'm going to want this data masked.
Recruit our top engineers.

1060
01:28:26,552 --> 01:28:28,429
I want a prototype right away.

1061
01:28:36,604 --> 01:28:39,773
Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send you on an errand?

1062
01:28:39,857 --> 01:28:42,067
I need you to go to my office.

1063
01:28:42,568 --> 01:28:45,070
You're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve all

1064
01:28:45,154 --> 01:28:47,698
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

1065
01:28:47,781 --> 01:28:49,366
This'll get you in.

1066
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:51,035
It's probably under Executive Files.

1067
01:28:51,118 --> 01:28:53,496
If not, they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need

1068
01:28:53,579 --> 01:28:56,290
to look for the lowest numeric heading.

1069
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:59,084
And what do you plan to do with
this information if I bring it back here?

1070
01:28:59,168 --> 01:29:00,211
Same drill.

1071
01:29:00,294 --> 01:29:02,379
They've been dealing under the table,
and I'm going to stop them.

1072
01:29:02,463 --> 01:29:05,549
I'm going to find my weapons
and destroy them.

1073
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:07,468
Tony,

1074
01:29:09,762 --> 01:29:11,639
you know that
I would help you with anything,

1075
01:29:11,722 --> 01:29:15,726
but I cannot help you if
you're going to start all of this again.

1076
01:29:15,809 --> 01:29:19,396
There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

1077
01:29:19,647 --> 01:29:22,858
There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

1078
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:27,071
There is the next mission
and nothing else.

1079
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,657
Is that so?

1080
01:29:31,825 --> 01:29:33,327
Well, then, I quit.

1081
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:37,998
You stood by my side all these years

1082
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:40,918
while I reaped
the benefits of destruction.

1083
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:43,087
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

1084
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:45,005
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

1085
01:29:45,089 --> 01:29:49,510
You're going to kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not going to be a part of it.

1086
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:51,595
I shouldn't be alive,

1087
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:55,015
unless it was for a reason.

1088
01:29:55,849 --> 01:29:57,726
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1089
01:29:58,227 --> 01:30:01,397
I just finally know what I have to do.

1090
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:08,529
And I know in my heart that it's right.

1091
01:30:24,253 --> 01:30:26,714
You're all I have, too, you know.

1092
01:31:36,283 --> 01:31:41,080
Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1093
01:31:54,009 --> 01:31:58,347
<i>You did not tell us that the target you
paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.</i>

1094
01:31:58,430 --> 01:31:59,973
- <i>As you can see, Obadiah Stane...</i>
- Oh, my God.

1095
01:32:00,057 --> 01:32:02,768
<i>...your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.</i>

1096
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:05,562
<i>The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.</i>

1097
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:13,946
So, what are we going to do about this?

1098
01:32:25,958 --> 01:32:29,253
I know what you're going through,
Pepper.

1099
01:32:36,969 --> 01:32:40,639
Tony. He always gets the good stuff,
doesn't he?

1100
01:33:02,286 --> 01:33:06,665
I was so happy when he came home.

1101
01:33:06,749 --> 01:33:09,543
It was like we got him back
from the dead.

1102
01:33:12,588 --> 01:33:14,548
Now I realise,

1103
01:33:16,842 --> 01:33:20,137
well, Tony never really did
come home, did he?

1104
01:33:21,847 --> 01:33:24,558
He left a part of himself in that cave.

1105
01:33:27,311 --> 01:33:28,937
Breaks my heart.

1106
01:33:31,231 --> 01:33:35,194
Well, he's a complicated person.

1107
01:33:37,905 --> 01:33:41,325
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

1108
01:33:47,623 --> 01:33:50,375
You are a very rare woman.

1109
01:33:52,878 --> 01:33:55,047
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.

1110
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,802
Thank you. Thanks.

1111
01:34:01,804 --> 01:34:03,847
I'd better get back there.

1112
01:34:09,311 --> 01:34:11,355
Is that today's paper?

1113
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:14,024
Yes.

1114
01:34:14,817 --> 01:34:16,193
Do you mind?

1115
01:34:16,819 --> 01:34:18,654
- Not at all.
- Puzzle.

1116
01:34:18,737 --> 01:34:20,030
Of course.

1117
01:34:23,534 --> 01:34:24,868
Take care.

1118
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:51,895
Ms Potts? We had an appointment.
Did you forget about our appointment?

1119
01:34:51,979 --> 01:34:53,522
Nope, right now. Come with me.

1120
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:54,731
- Right now?
- We're going to have it right now.

1121
01:34:54,815 --> 01:34:56,567
- Yeah, walk with me.
- Okay.

1122
01:34:57,734 --> 01:34:59,862
I'm going to give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.

1123
01:35:01,488 --> 01:35:04,324
Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

1124
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:08,245
Absolutely, we're...
I'm going to have to call you back.

1125
01:35:08,412 --> 01:35:11,123
Mr Stane?
Sir, we've explored

1126
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:13,542
what you've asked us, and it seems
as though there's a little hiccup.

1127
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:15,252
- Actually...
- A hiccup?

1128
01:35:15,335 --> 01:35:19,131
Yes, to power the suit, sir,
the technology actually doesn't exist.

1129
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:22,509
- So it's...
- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?

1130
01:35:22,593 --> 01:35:28,557
William, here is the technology.
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.

1131
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:32,644
Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.

1132
01:35:32,728 --> 01:35:39,318
Tony Stark was able to build this
in a cave! With a box of scraps!

1133
01:35:41,528 --> 01:35:44,573
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.

1134
01:36:00,714 --> 01:36:01,798
<i>Tony?</i>

1135
01:36:04,426 --> 01:36:07,763
<i>Tony, are you there? Hello?</i>

1136
01:36:09,306 --> 01:36:10,557
Breathe.

1137
01:36:11,725 --> 01:36:14,436
Easy, easy.

1138
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:18,815
You remember this one, right?

1139
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:22,861
It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

1140
01:36:22,945 --> 01:36:27,074
There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.

1141
01:36:29,409 --> 01:36:30,661
Tony.

1142
01:36:32,955 --> 01:36:37,334
When I ordered the hit on you,

1143
01:36:39,962 --> 01:36:42,464
I worried that I was

1144
01:36:45,467 --> 01:36:47,552
killing the golden goose.

1145
01:36:48,887 --> 01:36:52,641
But, you see, it was just

1146
01:36:53,976 --> 01:36:56,228
fate that you survived that.

1147
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:05,153
You had one last golden egg to give.

1148
01:37:09,324 --> 01:37:14,663
Do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?

1149
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:23,672
Your father, he helped give us
the atomic bomb.

1150
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:28,010
Now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?

1151
01:37:38,020 --> 01:37:39,688
Oh, it's beautiful.

1152
01:37:42,274 --> 01:37:47,112
Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony.

1153
01:37:49,448 --> 01:37:51,867
What a masterpiece. Look at that.

1154
01:37:53,285 --> 01:37:55,037
This is your legacy.

1155
01:37:57,539 --> 01:38:02,794
A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.

1156
01:38:05,964 --> 01:38:09,718
Weapons that will help steer the world
back on course,

1157
01:38:09,801 --> 01:38:12,054
put the balance of power in our hands.

1158
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:15,223
The right hands.

1159
01:38:18,351 --> 01:38:22,898
I wish you could see my prototype.

1160
01:38:24,316 --> 01:38:25,817
It's not as...

1161
01:38:27,152 --> 01:38:30,155
Well, not as conservative as yours.

1162
01:38:32,199 --> 01:38:35,035
Too bad you had to involve Pepper
in this.

1163
01:38:35,494 --> 01:38:38,038
I would have preferred that she lived.

1164
01:38:51,051 --> 01:38:53,386
What do you mean,
he paid to have Tony killed?

1165
01:38:53,512 --> 01:38:56,056
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...

1166
01:38:57,349 --> 01:38:58,600
Okay, where's Tony now?

1167
01:38:58,683 --> 01:39:00,393
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

1168
01:39:00,519 --> 01:39:02,646
Please go over there
and make sure everything's okay.

1169
01:39:02,729 --> 01:39:05,357
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.

1170
01:40:11,631 --> 01:40:12,966
Good boy.

1171
01:40:52,797 --> 01:40:53,840
Tony?

1172
01:40:56,509 --> 01:40:57,636
Tony?

1173
01:40:59,346 --> 01:41:00,472
Tony?

1174
01:41:02,641 --> 01:41:03,767
Tony?

1175
01:41:06,436 --> 01:41:07,479
Tony!

1176
01:41:09,689 --> 01:41:11,983
Tony! You okay?

1177
01:41:12,317 --> 01:41:15,987
- Where's Pepper?
- She's fine. She's with five agents.

1178
01:41:16,112 --> 01:41:18,365
They're about to arrest Obadiah.

1179
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:20,659
That's not going to be enough.

1180
01:41:44,474 --> 01:41:50,480
Section 16. Section 16. There it is.

1181
01:41:59,489 --> 01:42:02,158
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

1182
01:42:02,242 --> 01:42:04,369
Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

1183
01:42:04,494 --> 01:42:05,870
It's, like, a thing that's going
to pick the lock?

1184
01:42:05,996 --> 01:42:08,707
You might want to take
a few steps back.

1185
01:42:27,309 --> 01:42:29,811
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

1186
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:32,731
Not bad, huh? Let's do it.

1187
01:42:39,404 --> 01:42:41,740
You need me to do anything else?

1188
01:42:42,365 --> 01:42:44,159
<i>Keep the skies clear.</i>

1189
01:42:49,247 --> 01:42:50,582
Damn!

1190
01:42:58,590 --> 01:43:00,258
Next time, baby.

1191
01:43:30,413 --> 01:43:33,792
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

1192
01:43:34,376 --> 01:43:36,378
I thought it'd be bigger.

1193
01:44:21,172 --> 01:44:22,340
Take him out!

1194
01:44:33,101 --> 01:44:35,103
How do you think the Mark I
chest piece is going to hold up?

1195
01:44:35,186 --> 01:44:37,522
<i>The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.</i>

1196
01:44:37,605 --> 01:44:40,275
<i>That chest piece
was never designed for sustained flight.</i>

1197
01:44:40,358 --> 01:44:41,860
Keep me posted.

1198
01:44:43,653 --> 01:44:44,696
<i>Pepper!</i>

1199
01:44:44,779 --> 01:44:47,699
- Tony! Tony, are you okay?
- <i>I'm fine. How are...</i>

1200
01:44:47,824 --> 01:44:49,701
- Obadiah, he's gone insane!
- <i>I know.</i>

1201
01:44:49,826 --> 01:44:51,619
- <i>Listen, you'd better get out of there.</i>
- He built a suit.

1202
01:44:51,703 --> 01:44:53,163
<i>Get out of there right now!</i>

1203
01:45:05,008 --> 01:45:07,343
<i>Where do you think you're going?</i>

1204
01:45:12,849 --> 01:45:15,852
<i>Your services are no longer required.</i>

1205
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:17,520
<i>Stane!</i>

1206
01:45:42,712 --> 01:45:44,422
<i>I love this suit!</i>

1207
01:45:44,506 --> 01:45:47,717
<i>-Put them down!
- Collateral damage, Tony.</i>

1208
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:51,304
Divert power to chest RT.

1209
01:46:00,021 --> 01:46:02,148
<i>Power reduced to 19%.</i>

1210
01:46:09,989 --> 01:46:11,115
<i>Lady!</i>

1211
01:46:12,992 --> 01:46:15,036
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

1212
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:40,061
<i>For 30 years, I've been holding you up!</i>

1213
01:46:44,524 --> 01:46:46,985
<i>I built this company from nothing!</i>

1214
01:46:49,237 --> 01:46:51,823
<i>Nothing is going to stand in my way.</i>

1215
01:46:58,037 --> 01:47:00,582
<i>Least of all you!</i>

1216
01:47:10,008 --> 01:47:13,303
<i>Impressive!
You've upgraded your arm our!</i>

1217
01:47:13,845 --> 01:47:16,598
<i>I've made some upgrades of my own!</i>

1218
01:47:24,939 --> 01:47:26,899
<i>Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.</i>

1219
01:47:26,983 --> 01:47:28,693
Duly noted.
Take me to maximum altitude.

1220
01:47:28,776 --> 01:47:31,029
<i>With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...</i>

1221
01:47:31,112 --> 01:47:33,281
I know the math! Do it!

1222
01:47:41,539 --> 01:47:43,875
Sir, you're not going to believe this.
That thing is back.

1223
01:47:43,958 --> 01:47:46,586
Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!

1224
01:47:49,297 --> 01:47:52,300
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

1225
01:47:52,383 --> 01:47:53,635
Yes, sir.

1226
01:48:01,559 --> 01:48:03,519
- <i>Thirteen percent power, sir.</i>
- Climb!

1227
01:48:07,523 --> 01:48:09,567
- <i>Eleven percent.</i>
- Keep going!

1228
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:18,409
- <i>Seven percent power.</i>
- Just leave it on the screen!

1229
01:48:18,493 --> 01:48:20,078
Stop telling me!

1230
01:48:29,754 --> 01:48:34,384
<i>You had a great idea, Tony, but my
suit is more advanced in every way!</i>

1231
01:48:34,926 --> 01:48:37,011
<i>How'd you solve the icing problem?</i>

1232
01:48:37,095 --> 01:48:38,596
Icing problem?

1233
01:48:40,765 --> 01:48:43,101
<i>Might want to look into it.</i>

1234
01:48:54,779 --> 01:48:56,114
<i>Two percent.</i>

1235
01:48:58,282 --> 01:49:01,119
<i>We are now running
on emergency backup power.</i>

1236
01:49:12,797 --> 01:49:16,217
- Potts!
- Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

1237
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:20,471
I'm almost out of power. I've got to get
out of this thing. I'll be right there.

1238
01:49:20,555 --> 01:49:21,973
<i>Nice try!</i>

1239
01:49:34,485 --> 01:49:38,614
- Weapons status?
- <i>Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.</i>

1240
01:49:42,910 --> 01:49:44,495
Flares!

1241
01:49:53,004 --> 01:49:55,006
<i>Very clever, Tony.</i>

1242
01:50:00,344 --> 01:50:02,847
- Potts?
- Tony!

1243
01:50:02,930 --> 01:50:03,931
This isn't working.

1244
01:50:04,015 --> 01:50:06,267
We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

1245
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:09,270
- Well, how are you going to do that?
- You're going to do it.

1246
01:50:09,353 --> 01:50:11,773
Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

1247
01:50:11,856 --> 01:50:13,274
When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.

1248
01:50:13,357 --> 01:50:15,943
You're going to hit
the master bypass button.

1249
01:50:16,027 --> 01:50:17,445
It's going to fry everything up here.

1250
01:50:19,614 --> 01:50:21,866
Okay. I'm going in now.

1251
01:50:21,991 --> 01:50:25,203
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof.
I'll buy you some time.

1252
01:50:34,712 --> 01:50:36,547
<i>This looks important!</i>

1253
01:50:57,401 --> 01:51:00,238
I never had a taste for this sort of thing,

1254
01:51:00,321 --> 01:51:04,408
but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

1255
01:51:12,708 --> 01:51:15,211
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

1256
01:51:17,547 --> 01:51:19,715
You'd have made your father proud!

1257
01:51:24,679 --> 01:51:27,181
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

1258
01:51:46,701 --> 01:51:48,035
Tony!

1259
01:51:49,245 --> 01:51:50,872
How ironic, Tony!

1260
01:51:52,623 --> 01:51:57,587
Trying to rid the world of weapons,
you gave it its best one ever!

1261
01:51:57,795 --> 01:52:03,718
- Pepper!
- And now I'm going to kill you with it!

1262
01:52:06,762 --> 01:52:10,558
- You ripped out my targeting system!
- Time to hit the button!

1263
01:52:10,641 --> 01:52:14,645
- You told me not to!
- Hold still, you little prick!

1264
01:52:16,731 --> 01:52:19,275
- Just do it!
- You'll die!

1265
01:52:22,403 --> 01:52:23,905
Push it!

1266
01:53:21,462 --> 01:53:23,214
Tony!

1267
01:53:31,722 --> 01:53:33,808
<i>You've all received the official
statement of what occurred</i>

1268
01:53:33,891 --> 01:53:36,185
<i>at Stark Industries last night.</i>

1269
01:53:36,519 --> 01:53:41,023
<i>There have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned</i>

1270
01:53:41,148 --> 01:53:43,734
<i>and caused damage to the arc reactor.</i>

1271
01:53:44,485 --> 01:53:46,737
<i>Fortunately, a member
of Tony Stark's personal security staff..</i>

1272
01:53:46,821 --> 01:53:48,739
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1273
01:53:48,864 --> 01:53:52,493
I mean, it's not technically accurate.
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

1274
01:53:52,576 --> 01:53:55,162
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

1275
01:53:55,246 --> 01:53:56,914
Here's your alibi.

1276
01:53:57,748 --> 01:53:58,833
Okay.

1277
01:53:58,916 --> 01:54:01,085
- You were on your yacht.
- Yeah.

1278
01:54:01,210 --> 01:54:03,337
We have port papers that put you
in Avalon all night,

1279
01:54:03,421 --> 01:54:05,089
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1280
01:54:05,214 --> 01:54:08,342
See, I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me

1281
01:54:08,426 --> 01:54:10,219
alone on the island.

1282
01:54:11,512 --> 01:54:12,763
- That's what happened.
- All right.

1283
01:54:12,888 --> 01:54:15,016
Just read it, word for word.

1284
01:54:16,892 --> 01:54:18,936
There's nothing about Stane here.

1285
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:21,772
That's being handled. He's on vacation.

1286
01:54:22,690 --> 01:54:25,109
Small aircraft have
such a poor safety record.

1287
01:54:25,234 --> 01:54:27,695
But what about the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?

1288
01:54:27,778 --> 01:54:30,698
He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

1289
01:54:30,781 --> 01:54:33,117
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr Stark.

1290
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:37,204
Just stick to the official statement,
and soon, this will all be behind you.

1291
01:54:37,288 --> 01:54:39,540
You've got 90 seconds.

1292
01:54:42,418 --> 01:54:44,086
Agent Coulson?

1293
01:54:44,754 --> 01:54:49,216
I just wanted to say thank you very much
for all of your help.

1294
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:52,261
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

1295
01:54:52,470 --> 01:54:55,890
- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1296
01:54:56,223 --> 01:54:57,391
Right.

1297
01:54:58,309 --> 01:55:02,229
- Let's get this show on the road.
- You know, it's actually not that bad.

1298
01:55:02,313 --> 01:55:04,607
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

1299
01:55:04,690 --> 01:55:06,233
- You're not Iron Man.
- Am so.

1300
01:55:06,317 --> 01:55:08,778
- You're not.
- All right, suit yourself.

1301
01:55:08,861 --> 01:55:12,865
You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have
this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

1302
01:55:12,990 --> 01:55:15,618
She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always
be worrying that I was going to die,

1303
01:55:15,701 --> 01:55:17,953
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

1304
01:55:18,037 --> 01:55:21,791
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

1305
01:55:23,501 --> 01:55:24,543
crazy about me.

1306
01:55:24,668 --> 01:55:26,295
Tell me you never think about that night.

1307
01:55:26,378 --> 01:55:28,297
- What night?
- You know.

1308
01:55:31,175 --> 01:55:36,972
Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,

1309
01:55:38,641 --> 01:55:44,188
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1310
01:55:44,313 --> 01:55:47,525
and you left me there, by myself?

1311
01:55:48,734 --> 01:55:51,320
Is that the night you're talking about?

1312
01:55:53,489 --> 01:55:54,532
Thought so.

1313
01:55:57,243 --> 01:56:00,996
- Will that be all, Mr Stark?
- Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1314
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:04,625
<i>And now, Mr Stark has
prepared a statement.</i>

1315
01:56:04,708 --> 01:56:07,753
<i>He will not be taking any questions.
Thank you.</i>

1316
01:56:11,924 --> 01:56:17,054
<i>Been a while since I was in front of you.
I figure I'll stick to the cards this time.</i>

1317
01:56:19,056 --> 01:56:22,059
<i>There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred</i>

1318
01:56:22,184 --> 01:56:23,435
<i>on the freeway and the rooftop...</i>

1319
01:56:23,561 --> 01:56:26,313
I'm sorry, Mr Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

1320
01:56:26,397 --> 01:56:30,151
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,

1321
01:56:30,234 --> 01:56:33,362
- despite the fact that you...
- <i>I know that it's confusing.</i>

1322
01:56:33,445 --> 01:56:37,032
<i>It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely</i>

1323
01:56:37,116 --> 01:56:40,369
<i>to make wild accusations,
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.</i>

1324
01:56:40,452 --> 01:56:42,079
I never said you were a superhero.

1325
01:56:42,204 --> 01:56:47,543
<i>Didn't? Well, good, because that would
be outlandish and fantastic.</i>

1326
01:56:49,545 --> 01:56:52,756
<i>I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.</i>

1327
01:56:53,299 --> 01:56:56,260
<i>With this laundry list
of character defects,</i>

1328
01:56:56,385 --> 01:56:57,803
<i>all the mistakes I've made,</i>

1329
01:56:57,928 --> 01:57:01,223
- <i>largely public.</i>
- Just stick to the cards, man.

1330
01:57:01,307 --> 01:57:02,975
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1331
01:57:05,102 --> 01:57:06,604
<i>The truth is</i>

1332
01:57:12,776 --> 01:57:14,278
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

1333
02:05:17,511 --> 02:05:18,762
Jarvis!

1334
02:05:18,845 --> 02:05:20,597
<i>Welcome home, sir.</i>

1335
02:05:24,017 --> 02:05:29,523
"I am Iron Man." You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

1336
02:05:29,856 --> 02:05:33,110
Mr Stark, you've become part
of a bigger universe.

1337
02:05:33,193 --> 02:05:34,986
You just don't know it yet.

1338
02:05:35,487 --> 02:05:37,280
Who the hell are you?

1339
02:05:37,489 --> 02:05:40,200
Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1340
02:05:42,285 --> 02:05:45,247
I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.
