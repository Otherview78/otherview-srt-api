00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,737
<i>1931.</i>

2
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:11,539
<i>England and the Empire</i>

3
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:14,441
<i>are in the grips</i>
<i>of the Great Depression,</i>

4
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:20,247
<i>But the British aristocracy</i>
<i>keeps calm and carries on.</i>

5
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,885
<i>None more so</i>
<i>than the Davenports,</i>

6
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:28,422
<i>lords of Fackham Hall</i>
<i>for over 400 years.</i>

7
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,525
<i>The sheer grandeur</i>
<i>of Fackham Hall</i>

8
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:33,193
<i>was a testament to splendor,</i>

9
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:36,263
<i>and an enduring family legacy.</i>

10
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:39,634
<i>Its hallowed rooms</i>
<i>have witnessed so much.</i>

11
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:43,370
<i>Life and death,</i>
<i>laughter and tragedy,</i>

12
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,340
<i>heartbreak and romance.</i>

13
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:51,579
<i>But England</i>
<i>was a nation divided by class.</i>

14
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,146
<i>The below-stair staff</i>

15
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,315
<i>obediently served</i>
<i>their masters,</i>

16
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,585
<i>and prepared sumptuous feasts.</i>

17
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:00,755
<i>Pheasant, caviar, venison.</i>

18
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:04,224
<i>Whatever a guest desired,</i>
<i>they would supply it.</i>

19
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:09,564
<i>And whilst this winter</i>
<i>would prove particularly bleak,</i>

20
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:12,934
<i>the tireless work</i>
<i>of those staff below stairs</i>

21
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:17,572
<i>ensured that Lord and Lady</i>
<i>Davenport wanted for nothing.</i>

22
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:22,476
<i>They led a decadent life</i>
<i>of unimaginable luxury,</i>

23
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,748
<i>and barely</i>
<i>had to lift a finger.</i>

24
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:30,250
So, finally,
one of our children is to be wed

25
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,919
and shall soon fly the nest.

26
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:33,955
I'm just delighted

27
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:36,791
that our beloved home
shall remain in the family.

28
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,761
I'm just delighted that
after so many years of courting,

29
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:41,896
she's finally
found the right cousin.

30
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:44,498
At least Poppy's got
our interests at heart,

31
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,868
-unlike Rose.
-Rose may yet marry.

32
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:50,437
Oh, come on, Humphrey.
Who'd want old Rose?

33
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,709
She's 23.
A dried-up husk of a woman.

34
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:56,611
Barren, desiccated.

35
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:59,747
A wizened old walnut
of a spinster.

36
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:01,916
Rose, darling,
would you pass the milk?

37
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,787
Mama, Archibald is ghastly.

38
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,789
It's unfair to force Poppy so.

39
00:03:07,822 --> 00:03:09,356
Why can't she simply
marry for love?

40
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:12,259
Oh, how can you be
so naive, child?

41
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:15,596
Do you think that I married
your father out of love?

42
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,331
Because I found him attractive?

43
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:22,436
Liked his personality?
His micro penis?

44
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:25,873
No, I married him out of duty.

45
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:27,675
And we couldn't be happier.

46
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,911
But Mama's right, my darling.

47
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:33,447
This is about
the future of Fackham Hall.

48
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,283
Of our family.

49
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,754
We thought,
having produced four sons,

50
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:43,290
that the Davenport line
of succession was assured.

51
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:48,228
What cursed luck to lose
all four of them.

52
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:52,299
And in four completely
separate incidents.

53
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:54,569
I console myself knowing

54
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:57,772
that at least they died
doing the thing they loved.

55
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,345
But does this
not make you realize

56
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,014
that such an archaic
system of succession,

57
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:10,785
that only recognizes male heirs
is, pardon my French...

58
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,857
Rose, we must be realistic.

59
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,959
Your father's not going
to live forever.

60
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:20,595
Come on. Father has
the constitution of an ox.

61
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:22,429
- And so long as we keep
a close eye on him,

62
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,432
-he'll remain that way.
-How can you be so blind

63
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,701
to the circumstances?

64
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:29,003
Unless your sister
marries Archibald,

65
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,938
we will be evicted.

66
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:33,608
Forced to live
in Central London.

67
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,610
Then I'll find
myself a profession.

68
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:39,680
A Davenport working for money?

69
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:42,650
Are you trying to send
your father to an early grave?

70
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:46,020
All I ever think of
is Father's well-being.

71
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:49,322
Well, you evidently care less
for this family

72
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,658
than your beautiful sister.

73
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:54,962
Humphrey! Shield
your mouth when coughing.

74
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,765
My sincerest apologies,
Prudence.

75
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,002
My lord, ladies.

76
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:02,737
The dressing bell has been rung.

77
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,006
Drinks will shortly be served
in the drawing room.

78
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,608
-Thank you, Cyril.
-I do so hope

79
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:10,812
it will be sunny
for the wedding. Hey, Cyri.

80
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:13,380
-Mm-hm.
-What's the weather tomorrow?

81
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,984
Expect partly cloudy skies
in Fackham tomorrow,

82
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:19,954
with a 40 percent
chance of snow.

83
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,760
Do you ever worry that Cyri

84
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:28,428
is always listening in
to our conversations?

85
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,865
Oh, now, come.
Not this again, darling.

86
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:33,768
We've already had
to get rid of poor old Alexa.

87
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:35,670
That's true.

88
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:48,649
<i>London,</i>
<i>birthplace of emphysema,</i>

89
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,117
<i>child exploitation,</i>

90
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:53,921
<i>and a charming young</i>
<i>pickpocket called Eric.</i>

91
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:56,691
National ink shortage!

92
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:01,361
Read all about it!
National ink shortage!

93
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:09,136
-You there. Here.
-National ink shortage!

94
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,605
Blast and botheration!

95
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:13,708
Excuse me, sir.
You dropped your wallet.

96
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:16,077
- Ah.
-  -<i>Eric couldn't be</i> <i>more different</i>

97
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,980
<i>from the Davenports</i>
<i>at Fackham Hall.</i>

98
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:22,583
<i>He doesn't have any land,</i>
<i>titles, underwear,</i>

99
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:24,018
<i>or vitamin D.</i>

100
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:28,421
<i>But what he lacks</i>
<i>in bone density,</i>

101
00:06:28,455 --> 00:06:31,025
<i>he more than makes up for</i>
<i>in guile...</i>

102
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,193
Here you go, darling.

103
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:34,128
<i>-...charm.</i>
-Thank you.

104
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:37,430
- She's got my watch!
<i>- ...and boyish good looks.</i>

105
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:38,833
-Come here
-I didn't steal it.

106
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:40,034
Honest to God, sir, I didn't.

107
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,036
<i>Eric was amongst the thousands</i>

108
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,205
<i>of young boys orphaned</i>
<i>after the war.</i>

109
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,707
- Morning.
<i>- With only his quick wits,</i>

110
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:48,441
<i>street smarts,</i>

111
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:51,478
<i>and the watchful eyes</i>
<i>of the Sisters of Mercy</i>

112
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,781
<i>keeping him from penury.</i>

113
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,784
Morning, Sister Jude.

114
00:06:57,885 --> 00:06:59,553
What can I be doing
for you today?

115
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:01,155
Nothing for me.
But this gentleman

116
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,924
wishes to speak with you.

117
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:06,627
And of course, our door
is always open to unknown men

118
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:08,663
with an interest
in specific children.

119
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:13,734
Yes. He seems like
just the lad for the job.

120
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:17,004
I need a letter delivered here.

121
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:19,240
To the manor house
owned by the Davenports.

122
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,709
An obscenely rich
family of aristocrats.

123
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:22,977
Fuck 'em all.

124
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,011
That's right.

125
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:25,546
Fackham Hall.

126
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:29,884
The most lavish manor house
in all of Shropceistershershire.

127
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,219
Well, I'm not doing it for
any less than five shillings.

128
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:33,754
I'll pay you a pound.

129
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:37,224
Pleasure doing
business with you, mister.

130
00:07:42,263 --> 00:07:44,031
Good luck.

131
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,540
Eric.

132
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:57,545
You're the smartest child we've
ever had at this orphanage.

133
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,782
If only you directed your
talents down the righteous path,

134
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:03,851
you could really
make something of yourself.

135
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:07,088
"I may do some good
before I am dead."

136
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,658
It's Thomas Hardy.

137
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:13,094
Here's another quote for you.

138
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:14,996
"Thou shalt not steal."

139
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:23,971
Ah.

140
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:24,905
Your watch, sir.

141
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,008
Oh.

142
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,110
And your trousers.

143
00:08:29,143 --> 00:08:31,145
But I'm wearing my trou--

144
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:37,184
<i>And so begins Eric's adventure,</i>

145
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:38,986
<i>as he sets off to deliver</i>

146
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,089
<i>that precious letter</i>
<i>to Lord Davenport.</i>

147
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:44,592
<i>A chance to change his future.</i>

148
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,728
<i>And nothing was</i>
<i>going to get in his way.</i>

149
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:49,764
Whoa.

150
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:00,875
<i>Shout out to Rachmaninoff.</i>
<i>Big up on themself.</i>

151
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:04,578
<i>New track from Carl Ravell</i>
<i>and his orchestra just dropped.</i>

152
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:07,581
<i>Straight-up banger. Check it.</i>

153
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:47,121
Oh.

154
00:09:47,822 --> 00:09:48,989
Are you all right?

155
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:50,958
I've never been better.

156
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,799
Sorry I scratched your car.

157
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,068
Don't worry about it.
It was like that before.

158
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:02,303
I'm sorry about your bike.

159
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:03,838
Don't worry.
It was like that before.

160
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,740
I don't know what happened.
I think I was...

161
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:08,375
...momentarily distracted.

162
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:11,846
Yes. I only took my eyes
off the road for a second.

163
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,782
I think I was captivated
by the sight...

164
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:16,250
...of an incredibly
beautiful woman

165
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,418
with the kind
of carefree essence

166
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,788
that makes a man
glad to be alive!

167
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,831
Well, it was nice to meet you.

168
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:31,832
Eric.

169
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,034
It's Rose, actually.

170
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:36,737
It was lovely
to make your acquaintance.

171
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,306
And from now on, I'll pay more
attention to where I'm going.

172
00:11:29,524 --> 00:11:32,459
Ms. Davenport! Ms. Davenport!

173
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:35,362
The lord and lady is wondering
where you is be, they do.

174
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:37,798
-What did you tell them?
-I spared your blushes, m'lady.

175
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,433
Said you were wrestling
with a tricky dump.

176
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,736
Oh, thank you, Patricia.
I just needed to clear my head

177
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,371
before watching
my darling sister, Poppy,

178
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:46,840
marry that odious Archie.

179
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,811
There. Good as new.

180
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,991
Wonderful to see you,
Viscount Wolsey.

181
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,761
So good of you
to join us, Lord Lucan.

182
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:09,496
Welcome to our home, Lady Gaga.

183
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,203
Where on earth have you been?

184
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:17,972
Please don't say
reading or thinking.

185
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,407
As you well know,
that's men's work.

186
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:22,243
-Humpty!
-Ah!

187
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:25,813
If it isn't J.R.R. Tolkien,
the writer.

188
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,916
Poppy, dear old friend of mine
from Oxford, John.

189
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:32,319
Please. Call me J.R.R. Tolkien,
the writer.

190
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:34,255
It's a pleasure to meet you.

191
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:35,422
Would I know
anything you've written?

192
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:36,457
I doubt it.

193
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,424
He's not had anything published.

194
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,993
Well, not yet.

195
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,961
But I have spent
the last 15 years

196
00:12:40,995 --> 00:12:42,796
coming up
with an alphabet for orcs.

197
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,207
What a delightful language.

198
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,880
Remember, Fifi, the Davenports
are one of the most

199
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:01,415
eminent families
in the whole of England.

200
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,884
So, please, try not
to be too American.

201
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,220
Oh, please, honey.
They'll barely notice.

202
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:10,391
- Lord Davenport.
- You remember Bert?

203
00:13:10,424 --> 00:13:13,360
-Archibald's best man.
-Good to see you.

204
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:15,462
Thank you for having me.

205
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:20,034
What a quaint little cottage.

206
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,136
Oh, my.

207
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,104
Richard, do hurry up.

208
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:26,373
Gladys, is that
really all you can carry?

209
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:29,943
<i>As the orphan lad approached,</i>

210
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:33,480
<i>he sensed</i>
<i>this must be Fackham Hall.</i>

211
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:39,019
<i>He could tell by its grandeur,</i>
<i>presence,</i>

212
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:42,356
<i>and its sign</i>
<i>saying "Fackham Hall."</i>

213
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,354
-Excuse me, mister.
-Oh.

214
00:14:13,387 --> 00:14:17,224
Ah, you're here for the position
of hall boy. Is that right?

215
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:21,128
-Actually, I just wanted to--
-There will be no negotiation.

216
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,531
The wage is four pounds a week.
Take it or leave it.

217
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:27,101
-I'll take it.
-Edna.

218
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:29,269
I have procured you
a new hall boy.

219
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:33,240
Heaven forfend I get a say
in who works for me.

220
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:35,309
Do let us hope he's up to it,
Cyril.

221
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:37,344
Hut. Follow me, laddie.

222
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:40,347
As hall boy, you are the
lowest-ranked member of staff.

223
00:14:40,381 --> 00:14:43,417
Every afternoon,
you must polish the silverware.

224
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,086
Silverware is any utensil
made of silver.

225
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,524
Then it is dinner. Dinner is
a meal partaken in the evening.

226
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:52,426
After which you must clear
the plates from the table.

227
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,994
The table is an item
of furniture

228
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:56,196
with a flat top and four legs.

229
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,365
Finally, you must mop the floor.

230
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,702
The floor is the
bottom surface of a room.

231
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:04,371
A room is any space
enclosed by a number of walls.

232
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:07,307
A wall

233
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:11,378
is like a floor that's sideways.
Do you understand?

234
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:14,381
Yes, miss. I won't
disappoint you. I promise.

235
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:15,683
Get out of my sight.

236
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:18,620
Excuse me, sir.

237
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:20,354
Who do I speak to
about the hall boy job?

238
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:23,490
I'm afraid that vacancy
has been filled.

239
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,342
Ms. Davenport.

240
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,344
Allow me to introduce myself.

241
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:49,049
I'm Darvesh Khaled, your
father's lawyer and old friend.

242
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:52,520
Oh, yes. From the trenches.
You fought with my father.

243
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:54,556
No, we were on the same side.

244
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:57,090
Oh. Oh, Mr. Khaled,

245
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,259
may I introduce you
to Great Aunt Bonaparte?

246
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:00,260
A pleasure, ma'am.

247
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:02,496
Bonaparte.

248
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,031
Are you related to Napoleon?

249
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,534
Yes. He's my nephew.

250
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:07,669
Oh.

251
00:16:08,803 --> 00:16:11,371
Mrs. McAllister, I've done
everything you asked me to.

252
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:14,107
-Really? Already?
-Yes, ma'am.

253
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:16,711
You've brought all the wine
up from the cellar?

254
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:18,011
Yes, ma'am.

255
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,114
-Taken it to the drawing room?
-Yes, ma'am.

256
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:24,084
And closed the cellar hatch?

257
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,320
I'll do that now, ma'am.

258
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:31,325
Where is Richard?

259
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:34,294
He's supposed to be serving
the champagne.

260
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:37,364
You'll have to do it,
and not looking like that.

261
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:38,633
Get a move on.

262
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,271
You've got the castle,
the cathedral,

263
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:45,807
the chocolate factory.

264
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,307
I simply don't understand

265
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,276
why anyone would want
a new York.

266
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,312
Here's £10 to stop talking.

267
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:56,049
Now, I have a business proposal,
Mr. Davenport.

268
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,586
I'm expanding my fashion empire,

269
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,822
and I need a small <i>pied-à-terre</i>
in England.

270
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:03,056
How much to buy Fackham Hall?

271
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:06,326
I'm not sure you could afford it
on the wage of a seamstress.

272
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,128
I'll pay double its value.

273
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,632
And I promise
to keep its integrity.

274
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:14,802
All I'd do is add a jazz bar,
a small casino, and 30 stories.

275
00:17:14,836 --> 00:17:16,504
I appreciate that this may
be the way

276
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:19,273
you conduct your business
in the Americas,

277
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:21,509
but Fackham Hall
simply isn't for sale.

278
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:24,278
Well, we'll see about that.

279
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:27,114
A word of warning,
Mr. Davenport.

280
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:28,716
I have a habit
of getting what I want.

281
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:32,520
About half the size of a human.

282
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:47,401
Oh.

283
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:56,511
-Champagne?
-Yes, please.

284
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:00,447
Ladies and gentlemen.

285
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,750
Please welcome
the bride and groom to be,

286
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:05,352
Mr. Archibald Davenport

287
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:08,088
and Ms. Poppy Davenport,
his fiancée.

288
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,390
And first cousin.

289
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:19,199
My word, Mary, a man.

290
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:20,735
Oh, Constance.
He's so good-looking

291
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:22,235
I can barely breathe.

292
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,806
I can't wait till I marry a man.

293
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:27,341
It is only then that
my life will be of any worth.

294
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:29,711
Ms. Valentine, have you met
the Bechdel Sisters?

295
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,746
Ladies and gentlemen,

296
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:33,413
it is very rare

297
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,315
you find someone so beautiful,

298
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:37,852
someone so intelligent,

299
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:40,588
someone that you would
move heaven and earth for.

300
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:45,192
But after years of searching,
Poppy found me.

301
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,828
I just feel so lucky.

302
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:49,564
I mean, after all,
we have so much in common.

303
00:18:49,597 --> 00:18:51,498
For example, our grandparents.

304
00:18:51,532 --> 00:18:52,767
-Yes.
-Yeah.

305
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,202
Please, enjoy the festivities.

306
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:05,680
I'm sorry. You may never host
a party like this for me.

307
00:19:06,748 --> 00:19:08,516
My dear.

308
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,685
There are many here

309
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:14,454
who believe that marriage
validates one's existence.

310
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,256
I'm not among them.

311
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:20,662
I'm just so very proud of
the intelligent,

312
00:19:20,695 --> 00:19:25,432
kind, and elegant young woman
you have become.

313
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:26,701
Deviled egg, ma'am?

314
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:39,814
Stop gawping and do your job.

315
00:19:57,732 --> 00:20:00,635
So, wrong side
of Mrs. McAllister on day one.

316
00:20:00,668 --> 00:20:02,469
That's a record.

317
00:20:02,503 --> 00:20:04,404
So, you know your music, sir.

318
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:07,575
Is that your name?

319
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:09,309
Eric Noone.

320
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,012
Pronounced "no one," sir.

321
00:20:11,045 --> 00:20:13,915
So, which bedroom's yours then?

322
00:20:13,948 --> 00:20:15,248
Oh, I never sleep.

323
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:16,684
It interferes with my duties.

324
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:17,852
Here we are.

325
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,923
Your quarters.

326
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:24,959
You'll be sharing with Tom,
Fred, Harry,

327
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:27,562
Richard, and Alexander.

328
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:31,498
Jammy bastard. They've put you
straight in the big room.

329
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,770
All's well
that ends better, Humpty.

330
00:20:39,607 --> 00:20:41,843
Are you bride or groom, sir?

331
00:20:41,876 --> 00:20:44,344
No, I'm a guest.

332
00:20:56,858 --> 00:20:58,025
Whew!

333
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,048
My darling Poppy.

334
00:21:21,082 --> 00:21:23,718
Now, before you embark
on this new life,

335
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:25,553
I want to give you something

336
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:29,891
that my mother gave Prudence
on our wedding day.

337
00:21:38,065 --> 00:21:40,500
It's a necklace box.

338
00:21:40,535 --> 00:21:43,336
Oh, wow.

339
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,907
Oh, Daddy, thank you.

340
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,879
Alexander.

341
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:56,851
Are you ready?

342
00:21:56,884 --> 00:21:57,852
Mm-hm.

343
00:22:36,624 --> 00:22:37,859
Oh.

344
00:22:37,892 --> 00:22:38,926
Daddy.

345
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,460
Oh.

346
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,518
Please be seated.

347
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:10,925
Welcome, friends and family, and
of course, Archibald and Poppy.

348
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:13,160
Let us pray you never marry.

349
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:18,733
Let us pray.
You never marry without love.

350
00:23:18,766 --> 00:23:23,004
You never love without God. God
is almighty. God is everywhere.

351
00:23:23,037 --> 00:23:25,640
God is touching you all
in your private places.

352
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:29,043
God is touching you all.

353
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:32,013
In your private places,
in your darkest times,

354
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:33,714
God is there shining a light.

355
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:36,884
And today he's shining a light
for these two arseholes.

356
00:23:37,852 --> 00:23:40,221
And today he's shining
a light for these two.

357
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:43,991
Our souls
are eternally in his debt. Amen.

358
00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:45,059
Amen.

359
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:57,939
Does anyone have a reason
why Archibald and Poppy

360
00:23:57,972 --> 00:24:00,608
should not be bound together
in holy matrimony?

361
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:03,177
Speak now
or forever hold your peace.

362
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:07,081
No one? Good.

363
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:08,716
Stop.

364
00:24:12,219 --> 00:24:15,022
I know a reason why
we shouldn't marry.

365
00:24:15,723 --> 00:24:17,024
I don't love him.

366
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,627
I love another.

367
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,965
I'm sorry, Archie, but I cannot

368
00:24:23,998 --> 00:24:26,033
spend the rest of my life
living a lie.

369
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,270
Lionel.

370
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:30,938
Get up.

371
00:24:30,972 --> 00:24:32,039
Pop... Poppy.

372
00:24:32,073 --> 00:24:33,507
Poppy.

373
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:37,845
Now this is a fucking wedding.

374
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:43,184
Lionel? Lionel.

375
00:25:00,634 --> 00:25:03,904
I love you. I want us
to be together forever.

376
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:06,040
Okay. Okay.

377
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:16,550
Goodbye!

378
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:30,598
Your attention, please.

379
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:34,602
Your attention, please.

380
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:37,705
Shh.

381
00:25:37,738 --> 00:25:39,106
Shh.

382
00:25:41,308 --> 00:25:44,645
Despite today's unpleasantness,

383
00:25:44,678 --> 00:25:47,715
you must all remain
at Fackham Hall.

384
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:50,818
To spare Archibald's blushes,

385
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:53,754
I would appreciate it
if from this moment on,

386
00:25:53,788 --> 00:25:57,024
nobody mentioned
this morning's... hiccup.

387
00:25:57,058 --> 00:25:59,260
Specifically,
the disastrous wedding,

388
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:01,695
Archibald being humiliated
at the altar,

389
00:26:01,729 --> 00:26:02,797
the enthusiasm

390
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,165
with which the bride fled

391
00:26:04,198 --> 00:26:06,067
from her jilted fiancé.

392
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,701
And please, no mention

393
00:26:07,735 --> 00:26:10,938
of Archibald's animalistic
wailing from the vestry,

394
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:14,041
which we all pretended
we couldn't hear.

395
00:26:15,743 --> 00:26:17,745
Thank you, Lord Davenport.

396
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:19,914
That's very thoughtful of you.

397
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:21,782
Please all have
a wonderful weekend.

398
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:28,355
I knew it about
Lionel and Poppy, I does, I did.

399
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:30,758
Oftens I saw her
sneaking back late at night.

400
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:33,127
Never not said nothing
to her ladyship. If she asked,

401
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,963
I said Poppy was in the woodshed
whittling a dildo.

402
00:26:35,996 --> 00:26:39,266
That's quite enough
tittle-tattle from you two.

403
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,802
Ms. Rose
will take tea in her room.

404
00:26:41,836 --> 00:26:44,071
Yes, Mrs. McAllister,
ma'am, m'lady.

405
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:22,776
You? What? Why didn't
you tell me you worked here?

406
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:25,146
Why didn't you
tell me you lived here?

407
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:27,748
This is a big house
for a chauffeur.

408
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:29,416
Yes.

409
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:32,853
I'd rather appreciate it
if you didn't tell anyone

410
00:27:32,887 --> 00:27:34,155
you saw me driving Father's car.

411
00:27:34,188 --> 00:27:35,356
Don't worry. You can trust me.

412
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:36,357
I'm good with secrets.

413
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,692
To this day, I never told a soul

414
00:27:38,726 --> 00:27:40,828
about Sister Mary stealing
from the collection plate,

415
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:43,130
or Sister Jude's sex holidays
in Amsterdam,

416
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:45,866
or the time Father Jessop
tricked four choir boys into--

417
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,369
It's good to know
I can trust you.

418
00:27:48,402 --> 00:27:50,037
You certainly can, Ms. Rose.

419
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,307
Excuse me for asking.

420
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,009
What is that you're reading?

421
00:27:56,277 --> 00:27:57,344
This?

422
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:02,449
It's a tale of forbidden love.

423
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:03,851
Ah.

424
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,288
I'd love to borrow that
when you're done with it.

425
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:08,822
You read?

426
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:10,391
I forget who coined the phrase,

427
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:13,460
but reading brings us
to unknown friends.

428
00:28:13,494 --> 00:28:15,930
-That's Balzac's.
-No, it's true.

429
00:28:15,963 --> 00:28:18,265
I think it was
a French novelist.

430
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,202
Where shall I put your tea?

431
00:28:21,936 --> 00:28:23,871
I'd best take that.
Having a gentleman

432
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:26,407
enter my private quarters
would be...

433
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:36,350
Forbidden?

434
00:28:40,955 --> 00:28:42,823
Hall boy.

435
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:55,803
Eric. You leave us no choice.

436
00:28:55,836 --> 00:28:57,871
Your employment is terminated.

437
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,875
-My lady.
-I just wanted to make sure

438
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:03,545
the new hall boy
doesn't get into any trouble

439
00:29:03,578 --> 00:29:05,846
as a result of my asking him
to bring me my tea.

440
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:08,115
-You asked him?
-Yes.

441
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:11,051
To give Patricia a break.

442
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:16,924
Well, I'll leave you
to your meeting.

443
00:29:20,127 --> 00:29:21,862
Oh.

444
00:29:21,895 --> 00:29:23,764
I meant to ask for some sugar.

445
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:43,050
And you don't have to stand up
every time I enter the room.

446
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:53,528
Well, it seems
my hand is forced, laddie.

447
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:55,229
You stay.

448
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:56,830
For now.

449
00:30:13,447 --> 00:30:15,349
I truly thought

450
00:30:15,382 --> 00:30:17,084
that this would be where
I would live out

451
00:30:17,117 --> 00:30:18,485
the remainder of my days.

452
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:22,256
But there's little we can do.

453
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:23,924
The law is clear.

454
00:30:23,957 --> 00:30:27,461
Archibald is the rightful heir
to Fackham Hall.

455
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,930
Why did it have to be him
of all people?

456
00:30:30,431 --> 00:30:32,534
If only George hadn't died.

457
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,068
Or John.

458
00:30:34,536 --> 00:30:36,003
Or Paul.

459
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:38,972
Or little Ringo.

460
00:30:39,473 --> 00:30:41,141
Or our eldest nephew.

461
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:43,611
Humphrey.

462
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:46,213
I never dare ask Phyllis.

463
00:30:46,246 --> 00:30:48,550
What actually happened
to Archibald's older brother?

464
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:50,585
-Ah, Nathaniel?
-Mm.

465
00:30:50,618 --> 00:30:53,020
He went to fight the war
at a young age.

466
00:30:54,088 --> 00:30:56,558
To defend the freedoms
of this great country.

467
00:30:57,358 --> 00:30:58,593
Hm.

468
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:00,227
He was just a child.

469
00:31:02,463 --> 00:31:07,201
Officer Davenport. Are you ready
to make the ultimate sacrifice?

470
00:31:07,234 --> 00:31:10,037
Give those Jerries hell.
For king and country!

471
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:16,477
I've often tried to discover

472
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:19,480
what happened to the poor boy,
but to no avail.

473
00:31:19,514 --> 00:31:21,616
And now her surviving son,

474
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:26,487
jilted at the altar by our feral
little egg-brained daughter.

475
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:28,956
Even if Poppy did recant,

476
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:32,292
it seems inconceivable
that Archibald's wounded pride

477
00:31:32,326 --> 00:31:34,461
would permit him
to marry her now.

478
00:31:34,495 --> 00:31:36,029
What about Rose?

479
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:37,931
It's illegal
for sisters to marry.

480
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:43,170
Pity. But what if Rose
were to marry Archibald?

481
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:46,974
An intriguing proposition.

482
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:49,009
Hmm.

483
00:32:01,523 --> 00:32:03,591
Archibald? I don't know if--

484
00:32:06,661 --> 00:32:09,229
Archibald? I don't know if--

485
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:20,708
Archibald,
I don't know if I mentioned,

486
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:23,444
but Rose is very well-read.

487
00:32:25,078 --> 00:32:27,214
That comes as no surprise.

488
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:29,082
I mean, what else
is a woman to do

489
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:30,718
when she is without a husband?

490
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:34,087
Shit just got real.

491
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:35,989
Now that your honeymoon
has been canceled,

492
00:32:36,023 --> 00:32:38,192
you shall have
more time to read.

493
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:41,028
Perhaps I could direct you
to a tome on manners.

494
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:43,430
Sick burn, bitch.

495
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:45,466
Maybe the next time
you find yourself in a library,

496
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:47,602
perhaps you could
seek out some texts

497
00:32:47,635 --> 00:32:50,538
to explain how
a lady should behave, hm?

498
00:32:50,572 --> 00:32:52,707
Maybe then you'll have a better
chance of finding a husband.

499
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,676
Yes. It is unfortunate

500
00:32:54,709 --> 00:32:56,711
to have not had a partner.

501
00:32:56,744 --> 00:32:58,646
But is it not more careless
to procure one,

502
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,583
only to then lose her?

503
00:33:01,616 --> 00:33:04,519
Wasteman just got merked.

504
00:33:04,552 --> 00:33:07,154
Rose, may I speak
with you outside?

505
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:22,637
Rose, darling,
do you not see our predicament?

506
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,172
Thanks to your
sister's selfish behavior,

507
00:33:25,205 --> 00:33:27,341
if we are
to remain in Fackham Hall,

508
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:30,545
another lady in our family
must wed Archibald.

509
00:33:30,578 --> 00:33:33,146
No. You can't.
You're married to Father.

510
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,449
Darling. I'm talking about you.

511
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:36,551
Oh.

512
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:40,387
No! You think I would choose

513
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,056
to spend the rest of my life
with that pig?

514
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,659
No, I shall not,
and I shwill not.

515
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:47,060
Enough. Mr. Tolkien.

516
00:33:47,094 --> 00:33:48,763
-The writer.
-Indeed.

517
00:33:48,796 --> 00:33:52,634
Being contrary is the main cause
of brain degeneration in women.

518
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:54,702
Ask any male scientist.

519
00:33:54,736 --> 00:33:56,270
From this moment onwards,

520
00:33:56,303 --> 00:33:59,172
you must make Archibald
fall for you.

521
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:00,340
For the good of the family.

522
00:34:02,844 --> 00:34:04,211
Rose.

523
00:34:04,244 --> 00:34:05,312
Rose!

524
00:34:06,581 --> 00:34:09,416
So sorry. It's her time of the
month, where she menstruates.

525
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:19,459
I'm so sorry.

526
00:34:23,731 --> 00:34:26,199
Rose? Are you all right?

527
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,402
It's nothing you need
to be burdened with.

528
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:31,639
Please. It's no burden at all.

529
00:34:31,673 --> 00:34:33,508
You can tell me anything.

530
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:36,511
It will stay
strictly between us.

531
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:39,413
Mother wants me to marry
Archibald,

532
00:34:39,446 --> 00:34:41,381
but I do not love him.

533
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,451
I see.

534
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:55,462
You prefer to wait
for your Heathcliff.

535
00:34:57,699 --> 00:34:59,701
You've read <i>Wuthering Heights?</i>

536
00:35:01,536 --> 00:35:03,303
Eric, you are a rare creature.

537
00:35:06,507 --> 00:35:09,877
Do you think it foolish of
a lady to listen to her heart?

538
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,681
I believe
that when the heart aches,

539
00:35:14,515 --> 00:35:16,316
that's when
we should listen the most.

540
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:22,222
How does anyone know
when they're in love?

541
00:35:22,255 --> 00:35:25,526
- Maybe there's just
something in the air.

542
00:35:31,866 --> 00:35:33,367
I should go.

543
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:56,751
And look, there it is. Such wit.

544
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:07,461
Your mother thought
it would be prudent

545
00:37:07,494 --> 00:37:09,731
if you were
to join us for the hunt.

546
00:37:09,764 --> 00:37:12,365
Perhaps Archibald
may get to know you better.

547
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:15,268
Right now, I'd gladly
swap places with the pheasant.

548
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:19,272
I've always felt that
women do not belong on hunts.

549
00:37:19,306 --> 00:37:20,975
Don't be so utterly ridiculous.

550
00:37:21,008 --> 00:37:22,977
Ridiculous? It's science.

551
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,046
Their petticoats get tangled
in the undergrowth.

552
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,281
Their perfumes
scare the pheasants,

553
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:29,817
and their feminine giggles,
they rust the bullets.

554
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:34,055
Mr. Khaled, are you okay?

555
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:35,623
Yes. It's just...

556
00:37:36,524 --> 00:37:39,627
the sound of guns
being primed for action.

557
00:37:40,027 --> 00:37:42,496
It takes me back
to my time in the trenches.

558
00:37:44,397 --> 00:37:47,367
If you don't mind my asking,
is that how you got your limp?

559
00:37:54,776 --> 00:37:57,477
The war is over!
The war is over!

560
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,447
The war is over!

561
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,384
War's over!

562
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:05,620
War's over!

563
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:13,728
I'd rather not talk about it,
Ms. Davenport.

564
00:38:13,761 --> 00:38:14,829
I understand.

565
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:17,765
Thank you for your service.

566
00:38:28,543 --> 00:38:29,442
Ha!

567
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:31,078
Bloody good shot.

568
00:38:31,112 --> 00:38:32,914
Bugger it.

569
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:37,952
Well done, Father.

570
00:38:39,654 --> 00:38:41,756
Fuck it.

571
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:43,490
Not having much luck today,
Archibald?

572
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:44,759
Just familiarizing myself

573
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:47,128
with this new weapon.

574
00:38:50,164 --> 00:38:52,432
Bloody good shot,
old bean.

575
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,735
Yeah.

576
00:38:58,906 --> 00:39:01,776
Sir, shall I take him back
to the house and call a doctor?

577
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:04,377
No, no. Just chop his legs off
and roast him for dinner.

578
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:05,847
What about Richard, sir?

579
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,649
Oh, yes. Tragic.
Without a beater,

580
00:39:08,683 --> 00:39:10,751
we must curtail the hunt.

581
00:39:10,785 --> 00:39:12,787
-Sad day for us all.
-Father, wait.

582
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,155
There's a fellow
back at the house

583
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:15,957
who might be able to step up.

584
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:25,099
Bugger it.

585
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:39,513
Father. No.

586
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,185
Rose.

587
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:47,722
You're the most wonderful
daughter

588
00:39:47,755 --> 00:39:49,523
a father could ever
wish to have.

589
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:51,759
Tell Poppy I forgive her.

590
00:39:51,792 --> 00:39:54,862
But more importantly,
tell your mother that

591
00:39:55,763 --> 00:39:57,999
I... I...

592
00:39:59,934 --> 00:40:03,137
shall not be
attending tea this evening.

593
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:07,808
I'll never forgive you for this.

594
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,078
Excuse me, Ms. Davenport.

595
00:40:12,146 --> 00:40:13,547
There's no blood.

596
00:40:22,189 --> 00:40:23,090
Oh.

597
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:25,960
Blow me.

598
00:40:25,993 --> 00:40:27,595
Looks like my old pocket watch

599
00:40:27,628 --> 00:40:29,664
must have saved my life.
I'm alive.

600
00:40:32,066 --> 00:40:33,634
- Ah!
- Well, I have learned

601
00:40:33,668 --> 00:40:34,969
a very valuable lesson.

602
00:40:35,002 --> 00:40:37,104
Be careful where you point.

603
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,514
I can see a light.

604
00:40:48,516 --> 00:40:49,617
I can see my sons.

605
00:40:50,751 --> 00:40:52,219
John,

606
00:40:52,253 --> 00:40:56,090
Paul, George, Ringo.

607
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:58,859
Let's come together.

608
00:40:58,893 --> 00:41:00,695
I wanna hold your hands.

609
00:41:00,728 --> 00:41:02,897
Oh, dear Prudence.

610
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:06,734
Dear, dear Prudence.

611
00:41:07,635 --> 00:41:09,203
I am the walrus.

612
00:41:09,236 --> 00:41:11,038
His mind's turned fevered.

613
00:41:16,243 --> 00:41:18,045
Daddy's coming, boys.

614
00:41:30,124 --> 00:41:31,892
Ah!

615
00:41:31,926 --> 00:41:33,127
My Bloody Mary.

616
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,962
Of course.

617
00:41:34,996 --> 00:41:35,930
Bloody Mary.

618
00:41:37,064 --> 00:41:38,933
Oh, bad luck, old chap.

619
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:41,235
Ah, I really thought
you'd bagged your first kill.

620
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:43,104
Bloody Mary.

621
00:41:49,043 --> 00:41:51,045
Thank you
for stepping in to save Father.

622
00:41:51,078 --> 00:41:53,981
Ah, well.
Anybody would've done the same.

623
00:41:54,015 --> 00:41:55,683
But they didn't.

624
00:41:55,716 --> 00:41:56,717
Rose.

625
00:41:57,251 --> 00:41:59,587
I wanted to just say

626
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:03,891
sorry for shooting your father
in the heart... twice.

627
00:42:03,924 --> 00:42:05,926
I'm usually
a much better marksman.

628
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,195
It's this faulty gun
they've given me.

629
00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:09,964
It's wonky barreled.
It doesn't shoot straight.

630
00:42:09,997 --> 00:42:12,066
Um... May I?

631
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:14,735
Be my guest.

632
00:42:21,609 --> 00:42:23,044
As I said.

633
00:42:40,928 --> 00:42:42,063
Beginner's luck.

634
00:42:54,408 --> 00:42:56,644
Young man, I've been reflecting

635
00:42:56,677 --> 00:42:59,680
on your swift thinking
during this morning's shoot.

636
00:42:59,713 --> 00:43:02,116
You're a good sort
to have close by, Eric.

637
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,351
How would you like
to be my new valet?

638
00:43:05,686 --> 00:43:06,854
It would be an honor, sir.

639
00:43:07,688 --> 00:43:10,825
Excellent.
This calls for a cigar.

640
00:43:10,858 --> 00:43:14,929
Here they are, in my secret
cigar and money drawer.

641
00:43:14,962 --> 00:43:15,896
Thank you, sir.

642
00:43:17,131 --> 00:43:21,735
Alexander, pen yourself a letter
with news of your demotion.

643
00:43:22,903 --> 00:43:25,106
It'd be my pleasure, sir.

644
00:43:42,356 --> 00:43:45,359
What do you keep writing
in that little book of yours?

645
00:43:45,392 --> 00:43:47,394
Ideas. For my novel.

646
00:43:47,428 --> 00:43:50,097
I'm always listening
out for inspiration.

647
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:54,869
Oh, darling,
have you seen my cigar cutter?

648
00:43:54,902 --> 00:43:57,138
In your trousers, my precious.

649
00:43:57,171 --> 00:43:59,840
Wait. Say that again.

650
00:44:00,908 --> 00:44:02,009
Uh...

651
00:44:02,042 --> 00:44:03,744
In your trousers, my precious?

652
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,349
In your trousers.

653
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:17,458
Rose, I just wanted you
to know

654
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:19,293
that I was
in the library earlier,

655
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:25,266
and I chanced upon a poem
that reminded me of you.

656
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:29,937
Would you mind if I read it now?

657
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:31,172
Very well.

658
00:44:41,048 --> 00:44:42,483
Such a beautiful poem.

659
00:44:42,517 --> 00:44:44,785
- Mm.
- It appears your Archie

660
00:44:44,818 --> 00:44:47,188
is rather smitten with Rose.

661
00:44:47,221 --> 00:44:50,357
It's nice to see him
temporarily distracted

662
00:44:50,391 --> 00:44:54,228
from the Grim Reaper's
inevitable grasp.

663
00:44:54,895 --> 00:44:56,030
Indeed.

664
00:44:57,164 --> 00:45:01,268
I'm a lot more fun than
you probably first thought, hm?

665
00:45:01,302 --> 00:45:02,870
I'm sure you are.

666
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,906
- Enjoy the rest of your evening.
- Uh--

667
00:45:07,808 --> 00:45:09,476
-Cyri?
-Mm-hm.

668
00:45:09,511 --> 00:45:10,978
Play dance music.

669
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:13,847
Playing dance music
on the gramophone.

670
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:19,153
Hm?

671
00:45:19,186 --> 00:45:21,088
-Dance with me, Rose.
-I'd rather not.

672
00:45:22,256 --> 00:45:25,326
Um...

673
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:26,961
Don't embarrass me.
People are watching.

674
00:45:26,994 --> 00:45:27,895
Let go of me.

675
00:45:27,928 --> 00:45:29,363
Just dance. It's fun.

676
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:30,831
Archibald, let go of me.

677
00:45:30,864 --> 00:45:32,733
Ms. Davenport
asked you to let go.

678
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:34,768
Oof.

679
00:45:35,936 --> 00:45:37,304
Mr. Davenport,

680
00:45:37,338 --> 00:45:39,240
I apologize that my face

681
00:45:39,273 --> 00:45:41,175
interrupted
the flight of your hand.

682
00:45:41,208 --> 00:45:43,244
-Yes.
-And I deeply regret

683
00:45:43,277 --> 00:45:45,079
the behavior
of my junior colleague.

684
00:45:45,112 --> 00:45:46,080
As you should.

685
00:45:47,214 --> 00:45:49,383
When I inherit this place,
I'll sack the lot of you.

686
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:51,218
You impertinent morons.

687
00:45:51,252 --> 00:45:52,853
-Very good, sir.
-Yes.

688
00:45:52,886 --> 00:45:53,787
Eric?

689
00:46:00,361 --> 00:46:03,197
You have put
all our jobs at risk.

690
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,133
You are here to serve,
and serve alone.

691
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:08,135
Us lowly downstairs folk

692
00:46:08,168 --> 00:46:10,237
must never become
romantically entangled

693
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:11,805
with those above stairs.

694
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,376
Mark my words,
it never ends well.

695
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:17,579
If we are to see out
our days at Fackham Hall,

696
00:46:17,612 --> 00:46:20,147
then Rose must marry Archibald.

697
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,584
And you are obstructing that.

698
00:46:22,617 --> 00:46:25,152
Now, for all our sakes,
first thing tomorrow,

699
00:46:25,185 --> 00:46:27,555
you must pack up
your bags and leave.

700
00:46:27,589 --> 00:46:28,989
To save any upset,

701
00:46:29,023 --> 00:46:30,424
I shall simply inform
his lordship

702
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:32,393
that you have contracted rabies,

703
00:46:32,426 --> 00:46:34,128
found employment elsewhere,
died,

704
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:35,563
fallen pregnant, and run away.

705
00:46:36,297 --> 00:46:37,197
Now, go.

706
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,294
Rose. What are you doing here?

707
00:47:40,327 --> 00:47:42,564
I came to find you.
What did they say?

708
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:46,333
They fired me. I leave tomorrow.

709
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:48,670
No. No, they cannot,
and they shall not.

710
00:47:48,703 --> 00:47:50,471
They shwill not
and they shwell not.

711
00:47:50,505 --> 00:47:52,005
I'll speak to Father.

712
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:54,975
Rose. No, it's fine.
It's done now.

713
00:47:55,008 --> 00:47:57,545
- Oh, no.
- This place isn't for me anyway.

714
00:47:57,579 --> 00:48:00,314
-Fackham Hall?
-Yeah, fuck 'em all.

715
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:02,483
Well...

716
00:48:03,484 --> 00:48:04,552
Well, if this is to be
our last night together,

717
00:48:04,586 --> 00:48:06,987
let's go somewhere.
Somewhere we can be ourselves.

718
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,155
Just like when we first met.

719
00:48:08,188 --> 00:48:10,357
I know. Let's go to a pub.

720
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:12,527
What about the Dog & Drake?
I've driven past it many a time,

721
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,528
but never dared go in.

722
00:48:14,596 --> 00:48:15,996
Yeah, why not.

723
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:19,266
But they're not really
the biggest fans

724
00:48:19,299 --> 00:48:21,335
of you Davenports in there.

725
00:48:21,368 --> 00:48:23,571
So, you can't really go in
dressed like that.

726
00:48:27,474 --> 00:48:29,476
Then I shall just
have to blend in.

727
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,014
-Evening.
-Evening.

728
00:48:38,485 --> 00:48:41,523
-And stay out.
-But I'm the landlord.

729
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:46,226
After you.

730
00:48:54,201 --> 00:48:55,402
Follow me.

731
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:01,141
I'll have two of my usual,
please, Karl.

732
00:49:06,246 --> 00:49:07,314
Who's this?

733
00:49:07,347 --> 00:49:08,516
Don't you remember me?

734
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:10,184
My name is, um...

735
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:12,587
Rose...

736
00:49:14,054 --> 00:49:15,022
Devon...

737
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:17,291
Port.

738
00:49:18,192 --> 00:49:19,259
Rose Devonport.

739
00:49:20,394 --> 00:49:23,163
Good. 'Cause for a moment,

740
00:49:23,197 --> 00:49:25,032
you looked like one of them
Fackham Hall lot.

741
00:49:25,633 --> 00:49:28,570
And we hate those
stuck-up bastards.

742
00:49:28,603 --> 00:49:34,107
Well, I can assure you,
I'm apples and pears not.

743
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:38,011
Spoken like a true Cockney.

744
00:49:38,713 --> 00:49:39,614
Thanks, Karl.

745
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:46,386
-Ow!
-Bulls-eye.

746
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:51,693
Come here.

747
00:49:53,227 --> 00:49:54,562
Are all pubs like this?

748
00:49:54,596 --> 00:49:57,097
Oh, no, no. This is a posh one.

749
00:49:58,298 --> 00:49:59,466
Follow me.

750
00:50:00,668 --> 00:50:03,538
Perfect. My lady.

751
00:50:06,073 --> 00:50:07,642
One...

752
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:13,681
-Rose for the lady?
-Thank you, but I have

753
00:50:13,715 --> 00:50:16,684
a beautiful rose
of my very own right here.

754
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:21,756
Suit yourself, love.

755
00:50:22,557 --> 00:50:24,826
It's so thrilling
being here with you.

756
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:27,695
No more pretending, no more
holding back my feelings.

757
00:50:27,729 --> 00:50:29,329
I can be myself.

758
00:50:30,565 --> 00:50:31,699
Tell me your dreams.

759
00:50:31,733 --> 00:50:33,735
Well, I have this dream

760
00:50:33,768 --> 00:50:35,803
where my penis falls off,
but I can't go to the doctor

761
00:50:35,837 --> 00:50:36,738
because I'm late for school.

762
00:50:36,771 --> 00:50:38,071
Same.

763
00:50:38,105 --> 00:50:39,439
Really?

764
00:50:40,708 --> 00:50:42,142
Do you have any other dreams?

765
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:45,847
I dream of one day escaping

766
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,082
to the most
romantic place on earth.

767
00:50:49,116 --> 00:50:50,484
The city of love.

768
00:50:50,518 --> 00:50:52,252
The city of art.

769
00:50:53,153 --> 00:50:55,289
The city of poets.

770
00:50:57,792 --> 00:50:59,192
Blackpool.

771
00:51:00,127 --> 00:51:01,261
Wow.

772
00:51:03,297 --> 00:51:06,801
Maybe we could go there
one day. Together.

773
00:51:07,702 --> 00:51:08,770
Yes.

774
00:51:11,204 --> 00:51:14,341
Oh, no. It's a Cockney knees-up.

775
00:51:14,374 --> 00:51:16,578
Join in. You'll definitely
all know the words

776
00:51:16,611 --> 00:51:19,346
'cause we're all genuine
Cockneys here, aren't we?

777
00:51:19,379 --> 00:51:20,748
Yeah!

778
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:23,383
Just follow along,
you'll be all right.

779
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:05,693
Oh, well, he made it to seven.

780
00:52:05,727 --> 00:52:08,863
To London's oldest
ever chimney sweep.

781
00:52:08,896 --> 00:52:11,398
Yeah!

782
00:52:48,636 --> 00:52:49,537
Uh...

783
00:52:51,906 --> 00:52:53,473
Capital city?

784
00:53:00,548 --> 00:53:02,950
For a minute there,
I thought she didn't know it.

785
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:05,753
Yeah!

786
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:10,758
You cold?

787
00:54:20,628 --> 00:54:23,598
<i>But unbeknownst</i>
<i>to our star-crossed lovers,</i>

788
00:54:24,065 --> 00:54:28,836
<i>life at Fackham Hall was about</i>
<i>to take a turn for the worse.</i>

789
00:54:29,971 --> 00:54:34,642
<i>Especially for Lord Davenport.</i>

790
00:54:38,646 --> 00:54:40,915
Humphrey, open a window.

791
00:54:40,948 --> 00:54:42,917
Something smells ghastly
in here.

792
00:54:46,888 --> 00:54:48,355
Humphrey.

793
00:55:20,154 --> 00:55:22,355
Inspector Robert Watt.

794
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:24,625
I'm here regarding the murder
of Lord Davenport.

795
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:27,728
I'm afraid you're too late.
Someone's already done it.

796
00:55:28,796 --> 00:55:30,798
But come in anyway.

797
00:55:45,847 --> 00:55:47,414
Follow me.

798
00:55:54,088 --> 00:55:55,756
Hmm.

799
00:55:58,125 --> 00:55:59,459
Uh-huh.

800
00:56:00,061 --> 00:56:01,428
Oh, yeah.

801
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:05,566
Cyril, who was the last person
to see Lord Davenport alive?

802
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,168
The murderer.

803
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:08,569
Just as I thought.

804
00:56:08,603 --> 00:56:10,104
Now, would you be so kind

805
00:56:10,137 --> 00:56:12,472
as to pour me a glass
of that whiskey?

806
00:56:12,506 --> 00:56:13,708
Certainly.

807
00:56:15,543 --> 00:56:17,444
Wait. This is poison.

808
00:56:17,477 --> 00:56:19,013
Precisely.

809
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:21,682
So, Lord Davenport was poisoned.

810
00:56:21,716 --> 00:56:23,450
Not necessarily.

811
00:56:23,985 --> 00:56:26,087
-Do you see this?
-Yes.

812
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,923
Tiny holes in the lapel.

813
00:56:30,057 --> 00:56:34,128
Whoever did this had access to
some form of caustic chemical.

814
00:56:39,466 --> 00:56:41,102
And do you smell that?

815
00:56:43,004 --> 00:56:44,572
Whew, yes.

816
00:56:45,472 --> 00:56:48,910
An intense sulfurous odor
that stings the eyes.

817
00:56:52,747 --> 00:56:54,048
My apologies.

818
00:56:55,082 --> 00:56:57,018
That happens when I crouch.

819
00:56:57,985 --> 00:56:59,086
Oh.

820
00:57:00,487 --> 00:57:01,956
Specks of blood.

821
00:57:01,989 --> 00:57:03,024
Hm.

822
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:06,694
What did you wish to
speak to us about, Mr. Khaled?

823
00:57:06,727 --> 00:57:10,164
No, no, no, no.
Please, call me Darvesh.

824
00:57:10,197 --> 00:57:15,502
As you know, Humphrey entrusted
his affairs to my legal firm.

825
00:57:17,872 --> 00:57:19,507
He may have been my client,

826
00:57:20,207 --> 00:57:22,243
but more than that,
he was a dear friend

827
00:57:22,276 --> 00:57:24,178
and an honorable soldier.

828
00:57:24,211 --> 00:57:25,947
I just wish I could have been
there last night

829
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,214
to save his life

830
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:30,718
just as he saved mine
in the war.

831
00:57:33,054 --> 00:57:35,856
Incoming!

832
00:57:39,994 --> 00:57:41,996
You really should
get that mole checked out.

833
00:57:49,103 --> 00:57:50,504
Poppy.

834
00:57:52,873 --> 00:57:54,642
I'm so glad to see you.

835
00:57:56,143 --> 00:57:57,745
Hello, Mother.

836
00:57:57,778 --> 00:57:59,947
Poppy.

837
00:57:59,981 --> 00:58:01,649
Am I welcome here?

838
00:58:03,617 --> 00:58:07,722
Of course you are. Fackham Hall
will always be your home.

839
00:58:07,755 --> 00:58:10,224
Fackham Hall
is no longer your home.

840
00:58:10,257 --> 00:58:12,526
On the death of the lord,

841
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,528
the title and estate
passed to the next male heir.

842
00:58:14,562 --> 00:58:19,133
Therefore, Archibald Davenport
is now lord of Fackham.

843
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:23,904
But we're aristocracy.
Surely laws don't apply to us.

844
00:58:23,938 --> 00:58:25,172
Is there nothing
that can be done?

845
00:58:25,206 --> 00:58:27,041
The only respite I can offer is

846
00:58:27,074 --> 00:58:29,877
the title cannot
legally pass to Archibald

847
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:33,748
until the investigation into
Humphrey's murder is concluded.

848
00:58:34,248 --> 00:58:39,086
So, if, say, Rose were to marry
Archibald before that?

849
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:42,023
Then you can all remain here.

850
00:58:46,027 --> 00:58:49,130
The inspector would like your
presence in the drawing room.

851
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:51,766
What if we haven't got him
a present?

852
00:58:53,634 --> 00:58:55,202
Oh, very well.

853
00:58:59,774 --> 00:59:02,176
Poppy, what should I do?

854
00:59:02,877 --> 00:59:04,645
I don't want our family
to be evicted.

855
00:59:04,678 --> 00:59:06,347
But what is a life
devoid of love?

856
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,282
My dear Rose.

857
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:11,552
You know, I too
was once blinded by love.

858
00:59:13,954 --> 00:59:16,257
In those early
blooms of passion,

859
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:20,161
I didn't care a jot that Lionel
wasn't an aristocrat,

860
00:59:20,194 --> 00:59:22,263
that he had no money,

861
00:59:22,296 --> 00:59:24,198
that he didn't wash.

862
00:59:24,231 --> 00:59:27,768
I didn't care
that he wasn't handsome

863
00:59:27,802 --> 00:59:32,740
or kind, or monogamous,
or allowed near schools.

864
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:38,012
But if I were to have
my time again,

865
00:59:38,045 --> 00:59:41,348
maybe, just maybe

866
00:59:42,917 --> 00:59:45,086
I wouldn't have
given all of this up for Lionel.

867
01:00:03,304 --> 01:00:06,774
It appears you no longer
need to pack, young Eric.

868
01:00:07,341 --> 01:00:09,877
The inspector says
no one can leave.

869
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:13,114
Apparently,
we are all suspects now.

870
01:00:15,249 --> 01:00:17,985
I'm sorry,
I don't finance novels.

871
01:00:18,018 --> 01:00:19,787
Well, Lord Davenport

872
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,222
shouldn't be on your list
because he's dead.

873
01:00:21,255 --> 01:00:23,157
But otherwise, everyone's here.

874
01:00:23,991 --> 01:00:26,393
Thank you, Cyril.
I shall erase him.

875
01:00:26,427 --> 01:00:27,962
Good.

876
01:00:27,995 --> 01:00:30,030
My lady, esteemed guests.

877
01:00:30,064 --> 01:00:31,799
This is Inspector Watt.

878
01:00:31,832 --> 01:00:35,436
Well, I don't know.
Inspector Phillips?

879
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:37,371
-Hole.
-Wan-Bissaka.

880
01:00:37,404 --> 01:00:38,939
- Esposito.
- Drew.

881
01:00:38,973 --> 01:00:40,341
- Gadget?
- Aragorn.

882
01:00:40,374 --> 01:00:41,909
- Spector.
- No, no.

883
01:00:41,942 --> 01:00:43,444
His surname is Watt.

884
01:00:43,477 --> 01:00:47,014
I don't know. Inspector Deck?

885
01:00:47,047 --> 01:00:48,883
-Inspector Thoroughly.
-Clouseau.

886
01:00:48,916 --> 01:00:50,151
- Two-Bissaka.
- Bush.

887
01:00:50,184 --> 01:00:51,819
- Branagh.
- Spectacles.

888
01:00:51,852 --> 01:00:52,953
- Treebeard.
- No, no, no, no.

889
01:00:52,987 --> 01:00:54,221
His surname is Watt,

890
01:00:54,255 --> 01:00:56,323
spelled W-A-T-T.

891
01:00:56,357 --> 01:00:58,692
A-ha. I see. "Watt" is his name.

892
01:00:58,726 --> 01:01:00,094
-Robert.
-Robert what?

893
01:01:00,127 --> 01:01:01,762
- Exactly.
- Then what's his surname?

894
01:01:01,795 --> 01:01:03,230
-Yes.
-I'm so sorry,

895
01:01:03,264 --> 01:01:04,999
but I still don't understand.

896
01:01:05,032 --> 01:01:06,267
What don't you understand?

897
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,069
No, I understand perfectly.

898
01:01:09,103 --> 01:01:10,337
Now...

899
01:01:10,371 --> 01:01:12,706
After examining the evidence,

900
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:15,476
I believe Lord Davenport's
murderer

901
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:17,978
to be somebody in this room.

902
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:22,750
What reason would anyone here
have for killing my husband?

903
01:01:22,783 --> 01:01:25,352
Maybe they were fed up of
waiting to inherit this mansion.

904
01:01:27,488 --> 01:01:30,057
Or angry at being demoted.

905
01:01:31,225 --> 01:01:33,127
Or humiliated

906
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:36,130
after their attempts to buy
the hall were rebuffed.

907
01:01:36,864 --> 01:01:39,166
Or maybe
it's a failed police inspector

908
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,468
desperate for a case to solve.

909
01:01:41,502 --> 01:01:44,506
I mean, where was I
on the night of the murder?

910
01:01:44,539 --> 01:01:46,440
- Exactly.
- Indeed.

911
01:01:46,473 --> 01:01:50,744
Be warned. I shall be
watching you all very closely.

912
01:01:50,778 --> 01:01:52,346
And if there's anything
out of the ordinary,

913
01:01:53,548 --> 01:01:54,748
anything at all,

914
01:01:55,816 --> 01:01:59,186
you can be damn sure
I'll notice it.

915
01:02:35,823 --> 01:02:37,559
Truly a beautiful service.

916
01:02:37,592 --> 01:02:40,194
Oh, thank you.
Although in hindsight,

917
01:02:40,227 --> 01:02:42,329
I probably should
have attended the funeral.

918
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:48,402
Truly beautiful ceremony.

919
01:02:48,435 --> 01:02:51,238
It was just as Humphrey wanted.

920
01:02:51,272 --> 01:02:53,874
Never did like the idea
of a burial.

921
01:02:53,907 --> 01:02:57,911
Always thought the alternative
was somehow more dignified.

922
01:02:58,946 --> 01:03:00,281
Indeed.

923
01:03:04,285 --> 01:03:05,520
Excuse me.

924
01:03:11,425 --> 01:03:13,427
You do it, and you do it now.

925
01:03:16,864 --> 01:03:19,601
Emotions running high?

926
01:03:19,634 --> 01:03:22,236
Not at all.
Just a minor disagreement.

927
01:03:22,269 --> 01:03:24,371
Before you jump to conclusions,

928
01:03:24,405 --> 01:03:27,575
our discussion
was not about Humphrey.

929
01:03:27,609 --> 01:03:29,343
It was about Rose.

930
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:31,345
Mother is keen for us to marry.

931
01:03:31,378 --> 01:03:34,014
I'd wager your mother
can't wait to move in here

932
01:03:34,048 --> 01:03:36,551
and leave your crumbling
family home.

933
01:03:36,584 --> 01:03:39,153
Hm. Who told you
our house was falling apart?

934
01:03:39,186 --> 01:03:40,487
You just did.

935
01:03:41,288 --> 01:03:44,526
Come on.
If you want a real suspect,

936
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:47,094
try looking into
that orphan boy, hm?

937
01:03:47,127 --> 01:03:48,896
He viciously
assaulted me last night.

938
01:03:48,929 --> 01:03:52,933
Who's to say that his
violent tendencies ended there?

939
01:04:02,109 --> 01:04:03,578
I'm so sorry.

940
01:04:04,445 --> 01:04:06,914
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

941
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:10,117
It's so hard.

942
01:04:11,018 --> 01:04:14,455
Thanks. I've been working out.

943
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:18,092
Anyone could see just how
proud your father was of you.

944
01:04:26,634 --> 01:04:30,471
May I have a word
with you... inside?

945
01:04:32,072 --> 01:04:32,940
Hm?

946
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:49,256
Rose, you are an angel
sent in my hour of need.

947
01:04:49,289 --> 01:04:51,559
The first flower of spring.

948
01:04:51,593 --> 01:04:53,494
But more than that,
you are the most beautiful

949
01:04:53,528 --> 01:04:55,963
Davenport sister
currently available.

950
01:04:55,996 --> 01:04:58,265
-Archibald.
-No, I promise to listen to you.

951
01:04:58,298 --> 01:04:59,601
-But, I--
-I will never,

952
01:04:59,634 --> 01:05:01,969
ever interrupt you.

953
01:05:02,002 --> 01:05:04,606
Please make me
the happiest man alive.

954
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:07,207
Rose, will you marry me?

955
01:05:09,677 --> 01:05:11,011
Mm-hm?

956
01:05:14,081 --> 01:05:14,982
I...

957
01:05:20,354 --> 01:05:21,288
I...

958
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:23,625
I...

959
01:05:28,262 --> 01:05:29,196
Rose?

960
01:05:30,665 --> 01:05:33,367
I need time to think about it.

961
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,670
Of course.
I completely understand.

962
01:05:35,703 --> 01:05:38,540
Take as much time as you need.

963
01:05:45,012 --> 01:05:47,281
-Now?
-Still undecided.

964
01:05:48,315 --> 01:05:51,485
Okay.
Well, you have till Friday.

965
01:05:53,153 --> 01:05:56,624
Otherwise, I will propose
to one of the Bechdel sisters.

966
01:05:57,257 --> 01:05:58,726
I don't care which one.

967
01:06:02,564 --> 01:06:04,632
A man looked at us.

968
01:06:15,175 --> 01:06:18,746
Dear Lord,
I pray for your forgiveness.

969
01:06:19,514 --> 01:06:23,250
<i>The woman I love is being made</i>
<i>to marry a man she hates.</i>

970
01:06:23,283 --> 01:06:25,352
<i>And I felt powerless</i>
<i>to stop it.</i>

971
01:06:26,086 --> 01:06:29,089
<i>So, I strayed from</i>
<i>the righteous path.</i>

972
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,502
<i>That money, he didn't earn it.</i>

973
01:06:41,536 --> 01:06:44,104
<i>So, Lord, please forgive me.</i>

974
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:49,376
<i>And I promise that after this,</i>
<i>I will never, ever steal again.</i>

975
01:06:50,545 --> 01:06:51,779
<i>Amen.</i>

976
01:07:18,338 --> 01:07:22,409
<i>If you've been murdered</i>
<i>by a candlestick, dial seven.</i>

977
01:07:22,442 --> 01:07:24,812
<i>If you've been murdered</i>
<i>by a rope...</i>

978
01:07:34,254 --> 01:07:35,455
What?

979
01:07:47,367 --> 01:07:50,304
Rose, you don't
have to marry Archibald.

980
01:07:50,337 --> 01:07:51,438
What do you mean?

981
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:56,678
I've withdrawn my savings.
Let's run away together.

982
01:07:56,711 --> 01:07:59,547
-Let's start a new life.
-In Blackpool.

983
01:07:59,581 --> 01:08:04,886
Blackpool, Clacton, Skegness.
The world is our oyster.

984
01:08:04,919 --> 01:08:07,522
Skegness. That sounds
rather nice. Where's that?

985
01:08:07,555 --> 01:08:11,358
I don't know.
But we can find out.

986
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,860
Together.

987
01:08:14,796 --> 01:08:16,363
But we have to go now.

988
01:08:21,936 --> 01:08:23,671
I can't believe
we're doing this.

989
01:08:23,705 --> 01:08:26,874
Well, it's happening.
And no one can stop us.

990
01:08:34,816 --> 01:08:37,552
What on God's flat earth
is going on?

991
01:08:37,585 --> 01:08:42,624
I received an anonymous tip-off
from Mrs. McAllister

992
01:08:42,657 --> 01:08:44,759
that these two were absconding

993
01:08:44,792 --> 01:08:48,630
with money stolen
from Lord Davenport.

994
01:08:48,663 --> 01:08:50,632
Look, Rose
had nothing to do with it.

995
01:08:50,665 --> 01:08:52,432
I lied.
I said the money was mine.

996
01:08:52,466 --> 01:08:54,334
I told you, Cyril, didn't I?

997
01:08:54,368 --> 01:08:56,470
-Oh, yes, yes, you did, yes.
-I told you one of the staff

998
01:08:56,503 --> 01:08:58,205
would fall
for our eldest daughter,

999
01:08:58,238 --> 01:08:59,941
find an envelope full of
Humphrey's money in a drawer,

1000
01:08:59,974 --> 01:09:03,678
steal it, coax Rose out by
throwing stones at her window,

1001
01:09:03,711 --> 01:09:06,313
and attempt to drive away,
only to be thwarted

1002
01:09:06,346 --> 01:09:08,916
by a police investigator
who has trouble holding things.

1003
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:11,385
So, you didn't
get everything right.

1004
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:16,724
Oh.

1005
01:09:19,694 --> 01:09:22,797
So, what else are you hiding,
young man?

1006
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:25,232
Nothing. Nothing. I swear.

1007
01:09:33,641 --> 01:09:36,778
No. None of this is mine.

1008
01:09:38,646 --> 01:09:41,481
Your roommates told me
you were home late

1009
01:09:41,516 --> 01:09:43,685
on the night
of Lord Davenport's murder.

1010
01:09:43,718 --> 01:09:47,254
So, where were you,
and who were you with?

1011
01:09:51,324 --> 01:09:53,828
Well, if he won't tell you,
I will.

1012
01:09:53,861 --> 01:09:55,495
-That night we were--
-Completely separate.

1013
01:09:56,564 --> 01:09:58,633
No. No, we were in--

1014
01:09:58,666 --> 01:10:00,902
Our nightwear, in our own rooms
because it was bedtime.

1015
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:02,637
No.

1016
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:04,806
-We were together in the pub...
-...licly-held view

1017
01:10:04,839 --> 01:10:07,474
that ladies and staff
should never mix.

1018
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:11,278
Well, Eric Noone.

1019
01:10:11,311 --> 01:10:14,281
In that case,
I am arresting you for murder.

1020
01:10:14,982 --> 01:10:18,786
And in that case
are my toothbrush and pajamas.

1021
01:10:24,025 --> 01:10:26,259
Just tell them you were with me.

1022
01:10:26,293 --> 01:10:27,327
I can't.

1023
01:10:28,029 --> 01:10:30,865
Why?

1024
01:10:30,898 --> 01:10:34,769
You're a lady. You've got
your whole life ahead of you.

1025
01:10:34,802 --> 01:10:37,805
If I damage your reputation,
then that life is over.

1026
01:10:38,472 --> 01:10:42,977
I'm a no one. No ones
go to prison all the time.

1027
01:10:44,344 --> 01:10:45,312
Eric.

1028
01:10:46,346 --> 01:10:48,716
I know that one day,
we will be together again.

1029
01:10:49,382 --> 01:10:50,718
But in those intervening years,

1030
01:10:50,752 --> 01:10:53,054
as I await
that wonderful moment,

1031
01:10:53,087 --> 01:10:55,355
I swear to you
with all my heart,

1032
01:10:55,388 --> 01:10:58,059
I will arrange for the gardener
to have an eye test.

1033
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:26,353
I don't get it.

1034
01:11:26,386 --> 01:11:29,791
Eric never seemed like
the murdering sort.

1035
01:11:29,824 --> 01:11:33,393
He wouldn't have stopped
until he'd taken all our jobs.

1036
01:11:33,426 --> 01:11:34,896
Aren't I right, Mom?

1037
01:11:35,863 --> 01:11:38,431
I mean, Mrs. McAllister.

1038
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:42,570
Sometimes I accidentally
call people "Mom."

1039
01:11:43,137 --> 01:11:45,940
Do it all the time.
Don't I, Mrs. Mom?

1040
01:11:47,374 --> 01:11:48,910
Mrs. McAllimom.

1041
01:11:50,845 --> 01:11:52,980
Mrs. McAllimommy.

1042
01:11:54,916 --> 01:11:56,483
McAllister.

1043
01:11:58,152 --> 01:11:59,821
Mrs. McAllister.

1044
01:12:11,899 --> 01:12:13,100
Poppy?

1045
01:12:17,939 --> 01:12:20,407
Poppy, whatever's the matter?

1046
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:23,744
Lionel left. He said
he doesn't love me anymore.

1047
01:12:23,778 --> 01:12:25,680
He probably just said that
in the heat of the moment.

1048
01:12:25,713 --> 01:12:28,549
He said, "This is not
a heat-of-the-moment thing.

1049
01:12:28,583 --> 01:12:30,383
I've been thinking
about this for days."

1050
01:12:30,417 --> 01:12:32,720
Well, just give him some
time to calm down.

1051
01:12:32,753 --> 01:12:35,488
He said, "I don't need time
to calm down.

1052
01:12:35,523 --> 01:12:36,757
I'm actually really calm,

1053
01:12:36,791 --> 01:12:38,693
and this is the calmest
I've ever been."

1054
01:12:38,726 --> 01:12:40,027
Well, it's his loss.

1055
01:12:40,061 --> 01:12:41,996
Then he said,

1056
01:12:42,029 --> 01:12:44,699
"I stole all of your jewelry
and I sold it.

1057
01:12:44,732 --> 01:12:47,168
So, it's very much a win for me
and your loss."

1058
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:56,443
I fear that,
as you both inexplicably

1059
01:12:56,476 --> 01:12:58,779
refuse to wed a member
of your own family,

1060
01:12:58,813 --> 01:13:01,082
we shall all soon be homeless.

1061
01:13:03,985 --> 01:13:05,953
Oh, ladies.

1062
01:13:06,888 --> 01:13:09,557
I have lived through
many difficult times.

1063
01:13:10,057 --> 01:13:12,560
Those times
have taught me a lot.

1064
01:13:12,593 --> 01:13:17,932
So, I can honestly say
you are a bunch of whiny cun...

1065
01:13:20,101 --> 01:13:21,602
Sorry.

1066
01:13:28,175 --> 01:13:30,077
<i>Dearest Eric.</i>

1067
01:13:31,145 --> 01:13:33,047
<i>My heart is broken.</i>

1068
01:13:35,549 --> 01:13:37,952
<i>I didn't mean</i>
<i>for any of this to happen.</i>

1069
01:13:39,153 --> 01:13:40,922
<i>The image of you</i>
<i>reading this letter</i>

1070
01:13:40,955 --> 01:13:42,189
<i>alone in your prison cell</i>

1071
01:13:42,223 --> 01:13:44,125
<i>is something I cannot bear.</i>

1072
01:13:45,259 --> 01:13:47,094
<i>Every night when I fall asleep,</i>

1073
01:13:47,128 --> 01:13:49,462
<i>I relive the moment</i>
<i>you saved me from ignominy,</i>

1074
01:13:49,496 --> 01:13:50,831
<i>and I scream.</i>

1075
01:13:52,967 --> 01:13:54,835
<i>Every morning,</i>
<i>I awaken in tears</i>

1076
01:13:54,869 --> 01:13:57,204
<i>and reach for a handkerchief</i>
<i>to give my eyes a dab.</i>

1077
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:01,542
<i>I hope that one day</i>
<i>you can forgive me</i>

1078
01:14:01,575 --> 01:14:03,077
<i>for what I'm about to do.</i>

1079
01:14:04,011 --> 01:14:06,647
<i>I shall accept</i>
<i>Archibald's proposal.</i>

1080
01:14:06,681 --> 01:14:09,617
<i>These will be the last words</i>
<i>you receive from me.</i>

1081
01:14:10,718 --> 01:14:13,621
<i>All my love, Rose.</i>

1082
01:14:16,991 --> 01:14:22,530
<i>XOXOXOX.</i>

1083
01:14:51,926 --> 01:14:54,662
Ah, Rose. How did you sleep?

1084
01:14:54,695 --> 01:14:56,297
By lying on my bed
and closing my eyes.

1085
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:57,264
Oh, right.

1086
01:14:57,298 --> 01:14:59,166
-Archibald?
-Yes.

1087
01:15:00,301 --> 01:15:01,736
I have something to say.

1088
01:15:02,803 --> 01:15:05,873
Two days ago,
you asked me to marry you.

1089
01:15:05,906 --> 01:15:08,542
And since that moment,
I've thought of little else.

1090
01:15:08,576 --> 01:15:11,979
This morning,
I've come to a firm conclusion.

1091
01:15:13,581 --> 01:15:14,782
My answer is...

1092
01:15:28,896 --> 01:15:30,231
Yes.

1093
01:15:30,264 --> 01:15:31,198
Hm.

1094
01:15:34,869 --> 01:15:36,237
She said yes.

1095
01:15:37,838 --> 01:15:39,073
Huzzah!

1096
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,123
I know that look.
Your heart's been broken.

1097
01:15:56,157 --> 01:15:59,593
I, too, have tasted
true love and lost it.

1098
01:16:01,228 --> 01:16:03,898
"You shouldn't be together,"
they said.

1099
01:16:03,931 --> 01:16:05,966
"You're from
two different worlds."

1100
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,869
So, we ran away.
But we got caught.

1101
01:16:09,303 --> 01:16:11,072
It's like we've lived
the same lives.

1102
01:16:11,105 --> 01:16:12,306
Here.

1103
01:16:17,111 --> 01:16:20,214
This is Mildred.
Isn't she beautiful?

1104
01:16:22,683 --> 01:16:25,019
-Mm.
-Do you have a photo
of your love?

1105
01:16:26,153 --> 01:16:27,221
Um...

1106
01:16:27,254 --> 01:16:29,590
I nicked one before I left.

1107
01:16:32,393 --> 01:16:34,261
I was meant to give this
to Lord Davenport.

1108
01:16:34,295 --> 01:16:36,230
Well, open it.

1109
01:16:36,263 --> 01:16:38,799
What are they gonna do?
Lock you up?

1110
01:16:43,704 --> 01:16:45,706
"Yours sincerely,
Austin Blaine."

1111
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:47,975
What could it mean?

1112
01:16:49,777 --> 01:16:50,945
Try the other side.

1113
01:16:51,912 --> 01:16:52,813
Ah.

1114
01:16:55,683 --> 01:16:57,184
"Dear Lord Davenport.

1115
01:16:58,018 --> 01:16:59,987
Years ago, you tasked me
with investigating

1116
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:02,756
what happened to your nephew,
Nathaniel, in the war.

1117
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:04,859
<i>After months</i>
<i>of backbreaking work</i>

1118
01:17:04,892 --> 01:17:06,994
<i>and ingenious sleuthing</i>
<i>on my part,</i>

1119
01:17:07,027 --> 01:17:10,231
<i>I finally managed to unearth</i>
<i>Nathaniel's army records,</i>

1120
01:17:10,264 --> 01:17:13,000
<i>and discovered</i>
<i>that on returning from service,</i>

1121
01:17:13,767 --> 01:17:17,771
<i>he was mistaken for a war</i>
<i>orphan and raised by nuns.</i>

1122
01:17:20,407 --> 01:17:23,144
"With no clue
as to his real identity,

1123
01:17:23,177 --> 01:17:24,945
<i>the sisters renamed him.</i>

1124
01:17:25,746 --> 01:17:28,849
<i>Nevertheless,</i>
<i>I tracked him down.</i>

1125
01:17:28,883 --> 01:17:30,451
<i>Nathaniel Davenport,</i>

1126
01:17:30,484 --> 01:17:32,820
<i>eldest son of</i>
<i>your deceased brother, William,</i>

1127
01:17:32,853 --> 01:17:38,025
<i>now goes by the name</i>
<i>of Eric Noone.</i>

1128
01:17:38,859 --> 01:17:41,795
The very boy delivering
this letter to you.

1129
01:17:44,932 --> 01:17:46,734
<i>Dope reveal, right?</i>

1130
01:17:46,767 --> 01:17:50,804
<i>The dope reveal will cost you</i>
<i>an extra farthing.</i>

1131
01:17:50,838 --> 01:17:53,174
<i>Yours sincerely,</i>
<i>Austin Blaine."</i>

1132
01:17:55,309 --> 01:17:57,111
Blimey. I can't believe it.

1133
01:17:57,144 --> 01:18:01,048
I'm only sharing a cell
with the aristocracy.

1134
01:18:01,882 --> 01:18:04,451
What difference
does it make now?

1135
01:18:04,485 --> 01:18:06,187
I'm stuck here in this prison,

1136
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:08,889
and the love of my life
is about to marry Archibald.

1137
01:18:08,923 --> 01:18:10,925
Yeah. Your brother.

1138
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:13,194
-What?
-Your brother.

1139
01:18:13,227 --> 01:18:16,964
If you're Lord Davenport's
long-lost nephew,

1140
01:18:16,997 --> 01:18:20,935
that makes you
Archibald's older brother.

1141
01:18:20,968 --> 01:18:21,769
Which means...?

1142
01:18:22,803 --> 01:18:23,971
I'm the rightful heir
to Fackham Hall.

1143
01:18:24,004 --> 01:18:26,807
You had sex with your cousin.

1144
01:18:27,341 --> 01:18:30,844
Guard. I'm the rightful heir
to Fackham Hall.

1145
01:18:30,878 --> 01:18:35,115
Really? That's amazing. Then
I'll let you out immediately.

1146
01:18:35,149 --> 01:18:38,052
-You will?
-Of course I fucking won't.

1147
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,537
I can't let Rose ruin her life

1148
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:58,005
by marrying
that horrible bastard.

1149
01:18:58,038 --> 01:18:59,173
I've got to get out of here.

1150
01:18:59,206 --> 01:19:01,509
Well, you could
always tunnel out.

1151
01:19:01,543 --> 01:19:03,344
If only you had
something to dig with.

1152
01:19:10,284 --> 01:19:11,385
Oi...

1153
01:19:42,383 --> 01:19:43,551
Yes.

1154
01:20:17,951 --> 01:20:21,488
I hope Rose isn't going
to disappoint us like Poppy did.

1155
01:20:21,523 --> 01:20:23,857
-She won't.
-Well, you say that.

1156
01:20:23,891 --> 01:20:27,094
But my William married me
and then he died.

1157
01:20:27,928 --> 01:20:31,131
Just as Humphrey
married you and died.

1158
01:20:31,165 --> 01:20:33,300
And one day, Rose will die.

1159
01:20:34,201 --> 01:20:38,506
We're just particles heading
towards a cold, dark entropy.

1160
01:20:40,207 --> 01:20:41,509
But it's a lovely day for it.

1161
01:20:46,046 --> 01:20:48,550
Fellas. I've brought
a cake to celebrate

1162
01:20:48,583 --> 01:20:50,585
30 years without any escapes.

1163
01:20:59,293 --> 01:21:00,294
All right?

1164
01:21:24,218 --> 01:21:25,319
Oi.

1165
01:21:31,726 --> 01:21:34,461
Nice try, son.

1166
01:21:34,495 --> 01:21:36,130
Let's get you back
to your cell, eh?

1167
01:21:45,105 --> 01:21:48,375
-In here, pass them through.
-Here, 'gis it.

1168
01:22:00,354 --> 01:22:01,723
Hang on.

1169
01:22:01,756 --> 01:22:04,526
I know you.
You're that lad from the pub

1170
01:22:04,559 --> 01:22:07,294
with the bird
who's definitely a Cockney.

1171
01:22:07,327 --> 01:22:08,962
What are you doing in here?

1172
01:22:08,996 --> 01:22:11,398
They think I murdered
Lord Davenport that night.

1173
01:22:11,432 --> 01:22:13,500
No, impossible. You was with me.

1174
01:22:14,702 --> 01:22:16,470
Go on. Quick.

1175
01:22:30,585 --> 01:22:32,386
He went that way.

1176
01:23:10,224 --> 01:23:11,593
You may be seated.

1177
01:23:16,063 --> 01:23:19,099
God is with you all,
and Jesus is gay.

1178
01:23:20,467 --> 01:23:23,370
God is with you all,
and Jesus is.

1179
01:23:23,403 --> 01:23:25,507
Gay as we are
on this joyous day,

1180
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:27,509
we must take a moment
to offer thanks.

1181
01:23:27,542 --> 01:23:30,377
Clergymen such as myself
are given a power.

1182
01:23:30,410 --> 01:23:32,747
And that power
is to prey on children.

1183
01:23:34,582 --> 01:23:36,551
And that power is to pray.

1184
01:23:36,584 --> 01:23:39,353
On children,
God bestows a future.

1185
01:23:39,386 --> 01:23:41,488
On man, God bestows wisdom,

1186
01:23:41,523 --> 01:23:44,626
for God is strong and mighty,
and made us all hard.

1187
01:23:46,293 --> 01:23:47,595
And made us all.

1188
01:23:48,395 --> 01:23:51,833
Hard as life may be,
he is there to show the way.

1189
01:23:59,406 --> 01:24:02,075
Somebody stop that fugitive.

1190
01:24:02,109 --> 01:24:04,211
I'm innocent.
And now I know the truth.

1191
01:24:04,244 --> 01:24:06,848
The truth? But how?

1192
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:09,216
I'm going to the church.
I'm gonna tell them everything.

1193
01:24:11,151 --> 01:24:12,754
Stop. Stop.

1194
01:24:13,487 --> 01:24:14,722
What's up, darling?

1195
01:24:19,359 --> 01:24:20,460
Helmet.

1196
01:24:37,779 --> 01:24:39,681
Get back here.

1197
01:24:49,222 --> 01:24:50,123
Hey!

1198
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:54,629
Move.

1199
01:24:59,601 --> 01:25:02,537
Trampolines.
Get your trampolines.

1200
01:25:04,706 --> 01:25:06,741
Crash mats. Get your crash mats.

1201
01:25:06,774 --> 01:25:08,876
Didn't think
he was gonna make that.

1202
01:25:12,647 --> 01:25:14,181
Crushed my clementines.

1203
01:25:22,757 --> 01:25:26,527
Does anyone have a reason
why Archibald and Rose should...

1204
01:25:33,233 --> 01:25:33,935
Move.

1205
01:25:39,574 --> 01:25:41,208
In sickness and in health.

1206
01:25:41,241 --> 01:25:43,176
Until death do us part.

1207
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:44,712
Until death do us part.

1208
01:25:44,746 --> 01:25:46,246
Now, Rose, repeat after me.

1209
01:25:46,279 --> 01:25:47,615
Now, Rose, repeat after me.

1210
01:25:47,649 --> 01:25:50,785
-I, Rose Davenport.
-I, Rose Davenport.

1211
01:25:50,818 --> 01:25:52,553
I, Rose Davenport.

1212
01:25:55,255 --> 01:25:56,958
Hello.

1213
01:25:56,991 --> 01:25:58,626
Why are you doing this?

1214
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:02,262
I can't have you telling
everyone I killed Humphrey.

1215
01:26:03,463 --> 01:26:05,667
What? What?

1216
01:26:06,868 --> 01:26:09,704
Humphrey and I
kept our secret this long,

1217
01:26:09,737 --> 01:26:11,773
and I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let you

1218
01:26:11,806 --> 01:26:14,876
tell all of them
about our affair.

1219
01:26:14,909 --> 01:26:16,544
Or what I did to him.

1220
01:26:16,577 --> 01:26:18,780
-What you did to him?
-It was an accident.

1221
01:26:18,813 --> 01:26:21,916
Just another one
of our wee tiffs.

1222
01:26:22,717 --> 01:26:25,687
That boy Eric
is ruining all of our lives.

1223
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,723
First, he injures Richard
and steals his duties.

1224
01:26:28,756 --> 01:26:30,858
And then you give
him Alexander's job.

1225
01:26:31,592 --> 01:26:34,461
It's not fair on the boys,
Humph.

1226
01:26:34,494 --> 01:26:35,563
They are our sons!

1227
01:26:35,596 --> 01:26:37,965
Keep your damn voice down.

1228
01:26:37,999 --> 01:26:39,767
That's all
you want from me, isn't it?

1229
01:26:39,801 --> 01:26:41,301
To keep quiet and carry on.

1230
01:26:41,334 --> 01:26:43,437
Get rid of him.

1231
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:45,673
Or I'll tell everyone
about our affair.

1232
01:26:47,842 --> 01:26:48,810
Edna.

1233
01:26:48,843 --> 01:26:50,645
My darling.

1234
01:26:51,646 --> 01:26:52,680
Come now.

1235
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:54,314
No.

1236
01:26:54,347 --> 01:26:55,817
Be sensible.

1237
01:26:56,884 --> 01:26:58,653
No.

1238
01:26:58,686 --> 01:27:00,922
Humphrey?

1239
01:27:03,658 --> 01:27:04,959
Oh, my God.

1240
01:27:05,927 --> 01:27:07,895
Don't... Don't touch it.

1241
01:27:07,929 --> 01:27:11,231
-I'll call for help.
-What? No time.

1242
01:27:12,567 --> 01:27:13,534
Shoot it out.

1243
01:27:13,568 --> 01:27:15,837
Yes, yes.

1244
01:27:22,043 --> 01:27:24,411
-It didn't work.
-It's okay.

1245
01:27:24,444 --> 01:27:28,549
We just need to get
the bullets out. Grab that acid.

1246
01:27:28,583 --> 01:27:29,717
We can dissolve them.

1247
01:27:31,619 --> 01:27:32,954
Wait, wait.

1248
01:27:32,987 --> 01:27:35,590
I just need to steady my nerve.

1249
01:27:37,692 --> 01:27:38,793
Ah!

1250
01:27:38,826 --> 01:27:40,494
Okay. Do it.

1251
01:27:43,998 --> 01:27:47,068
-It's burning.
-You're still bleeding.

1252
01:27:47,101 --> 01:27:50,470
Quick. You've got to stop
the blood leaving my brain.

1253
01:27:51,371 --> 01:27:53,473
Use your belt as a tourniquet
on my neck.

1254
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:01,414
It's not working.

1255
01:28:28,375 --> 01:28:31,012
<i>That's when</i>
<i>I decided to frame you.</i>

1256
01:28:31,045 --> 01:28:36,751
<i>Nobody cares if a wee</i>
<i>orphan boy ends up in jail.</i>

1257
01:28:37,518 --> 01:28:39,120
Or dead.

1258
01:28:39,153 --> 01:28:40,655
Watt?

1259
01:28:40,688 --> 01:28:43,490
I'm not gonna say all again.

1260
01:28:43,524 --> 01:28:44,457
No.

1261
01:28:45,059 --> 01:28:46,661
Inspector Watt.

1262
01:28:47,595 --> 01:28:48,629
Did you hear that?

1263
01:28:50,665 --> 01:28:52,465
I certainly did.

1264
01:28:53,568 --> 01:28:59,040
Madam, you are under arrest.
For manslaughter.

1265
01:28:59,073 --> 01:29:00,741
Ah.

1266
01:29:02,777 --> 01:29:04,846
In sickness and in health.

1267
01:29:04,879 --> 01:29:06,379
Until death do us part.

1268
01:29:06,814 --> 01:29:08,816
Until death do us part.

1269
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:09,951
Stop the wedding.

1270
01:29:11,018 --> 01:29:12,019
What the fuck is going on?

1271
01:29:12,053 --> 01:29:13,154
What the fuck is going on?

1272
01:29:13,187 --> 01:29:16,090
What the fuck is going on? Eric?

1273
01:29:16,123 --> 01:29:18,059
You don't have
to marry Archibald.

1274
01:29:18,826 --> 01:29:21,428
Get this murderous scum
out of here.

1275
01:29:21,461 --> 01:29:22,897
He's not the murderer.

1276
01:29:24,532 --> 01:29:27,902
It was Mrs. McAllister.

1277
01:29:27,935 --> 01:29:30,470
And Archibald is not the
rightful heir to Fackham Hall.

1278
01:29:30,503 --> 01:29:31,973
What?

1279
01:29:32,006 --> 01:29:34,842
I have a letter here
that explains everything.

1280
01:29:36,744 --> 01:29:37,812
Mom.

1281
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:41,883
It's me. Nathaniel.

1282
01:29:44,852 --> 01:29:47,588
My son. You're alive.

1283
01:29:48,856 --> 01:29:50,490
So, does that mean...?

1284
01:29:51,192 --> 01:29:53,961
That we can be together.

1285
01:29:53,995 --> 01:29:55,997
And you and your family
can live in Fackham Hall

1286
01:29:56,030 --> 01:29:57,598
for the rest of your lives.

1287
01:29:59,200 --> 01:30:03,104
Well, I've always rather liked
being the only

1288
01:30:03,137 --> 01:30:04,404
-child.
-No.

1289
01:30:10,678 --> 01:30:12,479
You truly are a terrible shot.

1290
01:30:12,513 --> 01:30:14,582
-Well, I...
-You're nicked.

1291
01:30:14,615 --> 01:30:18,519
-What?
-It's Inspector Watt to you.

1292
01:30:18,552 --> 01:30:20,554
-Get your dirty hands off me.
-Would it be possible

1293
01:30:20,588 --> 01:30:23,124
to pick up where we left off?
Except with this gentleman?

1294
01:30:23,157 --> 01:30:25,059
Yes. Yes, well, where were we?

1295
01:30:25,092 --> 01:30:27,494
-Let go of me, I say.
-Rose Davenport,

1296
01:30:27,528 --> 01:30:30,965
do you take Eric Noone,
AKA Nathaniel Davenport,

1297
01:30:30,998 --> 01:30:33,734
-to be your husband?
-I do.

1298
01:30:35,202 --> 01:30:36,904
And do you, Eric Noone,

1299
01:30:36,938 --> 01:30:40,174
AKA Nathaniel Davenport,
take Rose Davenport

1300
01:30:40,207 --> 01:30:42,743
-to be your wife?
-I do.

1301
01:30:42,777 --> 01:30:45,212
Well, then,
I pronounce you man and wife.

1302
01:30:45,246 --> 01:30:46,647
You may kiss the choirboys.

1303
01:30:51,052 --> 01:30:53,955
You may kiss. The choirboys
will now sing Ave Maria.

1304
01:30:57,792 --> 01:30:59,727
Fackham Hall is saved.

1305
01:31:00,661 --> 01:31:01,796
Bravo.

1306
01:31:10,905 --> 01:31:15,609
I don't think we've met.
J.R.R. Tolkien, the writer.

1307
01:31:15,643 --> 01:31:18,579
Oh. Bill. Bill Bobaggins.

1308
01:31:18,612 --> 01:31:20,181
What a wonderful name.

1309
01:31:21,248 --> 01:31:24,585
Bilbo Baggins.

1310
01:31:24,618 --> 01:31:26,187
And this is the donkey
I'm fucking.

1311
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:32,760
Well, I've written it down now.

1312
01:31:38,132 --> 01:31:42,303
<i>Love.</i>
<i>It can transcend boundaries.</i>

1313
01:31:42,336 --> 01:31:45,072
<i>There is nothing more powerful.</i>

1314
01:31:45,106 --> 01:31:48,709
<i>Other than, in this case,</i>
<i>birthright.</i>

1315
01:31:50,111 --> 01:31:52,013
<i>You may wonder how I was privy</i>

1316
01:31:52,046 --> 01:31:54,281
<i>to so much of what</i>
<i>took place in Fackham Hall...</i>

1317
01:31:54,315 --> 01:31:56,183
-Move a little to your right.
<i>-...that fateful week.</i>

1318
01:31:56,217 --> 01:31:57,785
-Excellent.
<i>-That, dear friends,</i>

1319
01:31:57,818 --> 01:32:00,788
<i>-is because I was there.</i>
-Three, two, one...

1320
01:32:00,821 --> 01:32:04,225
-Fackham Hall.
<i>-And who am I? I'm no one.</i>

1321
01:32:04,258 --> 01:32:06,827
<i>Rose Davenport Noone.</i>

1322
01:32:06,861 --> 01:32:09,096
Fackham Hall.

1323
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:10,998
<i>And this...</i>

1324
01:32:11,032 --> 01:32:13,567
<i>...is my story.</i>
