1
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:32,366
<i>The Tesseract has awakened.</i>

2
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:38,039
It is on a little world, a human world.

3
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:42,126
They would wield its power,

4
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:48,132
but our ally knows its
workings as they never will.

5
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:52,762
<i>He is ready to lead</i>

6
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:58,392
<i>and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.</i>

7
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,438
<i>A world will be his.</i>

8
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:05,733
<i>The universe, yours.</i>

9
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,530
<i>And the humans,
what can they do but burn?</i>

10
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,171
<i>All personnel,</i>

11
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:29,590
<i>the evacuation order
has been confirmed.</i>

12
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,999
How bad is it?

13
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:06,294
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

14
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,967
Dr Selvig read an energy surge
from the Tesseract four hours ago.

15
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,969
NASA didn't authorise Selvig
to go to test phase.

16
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:17,388
He wasn't testing it.
He wasn't even in the room.

17
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:18,556
Spontaneous event.

18
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,640
It just turned itself on?

19
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:21,142
Where are the energy levels now?

20
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:23,519
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't
shut it down, we ordered evac.

21
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:24,729
How long to get everyone out?

22
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:26,480
Campus should be clear
in the next half-hour.

23
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,940
Do better.

24
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,860
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

25
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,278
We should tell them
to go back to sleep?

26
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,864
If we can't control
the Tesseract's energy,

27
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:37,408
there may not be
a minimum safe distance.

28
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,576
I need you to make sure

29
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,369
the Phase 2 prototypes
are shipped out.

30
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,580
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

31
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,498
Until such time as the world ends,

32
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:46,459
we will act as though
it intends to spin on.

33
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,003
Clear out the tech below.

34
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,255
Every piece of Phase 2
on a truck and gone.

35
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:52,840
Yes, sir.

36
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,425
With me.

37
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:58,429
Talk to me, Doctor.

38
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:01,849
Director.

39
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,726
Is there anything we know for certain?

40
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:06,145
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

41
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:09,148
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- No, it's not funny at all.

42
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:12,651
The Tesseract is not only
active, she's behaving.

43
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:14,111
I assume you pulled the plug.

44
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,988
She's an energy source.

45
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:19,367
We turn off the power,
she turns it back on.

46
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,576
If she reaches peak level...

47
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:24,205
We prepared for this, Doctor.
Harnessing energy from space.

48
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:25,790
But we don't have the harness.

49
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:26,957
My calculations are far from complete.

50
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,294
And she's throwing off
interference, radiation.

51
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,921
Nothing harmful,
low levels of gamma radiation.

52
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,673
That can be harmful.

53
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,592
Where's Agent Barton?

54
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,469
The Hawk?

55
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:40,971
Up in his nest, as usual.

56
00:03:42,807 --> 00:03:44,642
<i>Agent Barton, report.</i>

57
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:46,685
<i>I gave you this detail</i>

58
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,354
<i>so you could keep
a close eye on things.</i>

59
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,980
Well, I see better from a distance.

60
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,857
Have you seen anything
that might set this thing off?

61
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:54,735
Doctor, it's spiking again.

62
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,320
No one's come or gone.

63
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,155
And Selvig's clean.

64
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,491
No contacts, no IMs.

65
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:02,701
If there was any tampering,
sir, it wasn't at this end.

66
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:06,205
"At this end"?

67
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:10,292
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to
the other end of space, right?

68
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:13,295
Doors open from both sides.

69
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,506
Not yet.

70
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:26,452
Sir, please put down the spear.

71
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:56,452
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

72
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:06,825
You have heart.

73
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,149
Please don't.

74
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:41,902
I still need that.

75
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,821
This doesn't have to get any messier.

76
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,072
Of course it does.

77
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,032
I've come too far for anything else.

78
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:51,829
I am Loki, of Asgard

79
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:55,165
and I am burdened with
glorious purpose.

80
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,834
Loki,

81
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,627
brother of Thor.

82
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,963
We have no quarrel with your people.

83
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,133
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

84
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:06,510
Are you planning to step on us?

85
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:10,097
I come with glad tidings

86
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,017
of a world made free.

87
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:14,602
Free from what?

88
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,936
Freedom.

89
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,064
Freedom is life's great lie.

90
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,776
Once you accept that, in your heart,

91
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:29,074
you will know peace.

92
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:32,119
Yeah, you say "peace,"

93
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,204
I kind of think you mean the other thing.

94
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,874
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

95
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,459
This place is about to blow

96
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,960
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.

97
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,713
He means to bury us.

98
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,048
Like the pharaohs of old.

99
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,300
He's right. The portal
is collapsing in on itself.

100
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,552
We've got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical.

101
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:49,887
Well, then.

102
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:06,737
I need these vehicles.

103
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,910
- Who's that?
- They didn't tell me.

104
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,498
<i>Hill!</i>

105
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:18,624
Do you copy?

106
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:21,126
<i>Barton has turned.</i>

107
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:36,934
They have the Tesseract!
Shut them down!

108
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,681
Okay, let's go. No, leave it. Go!

109
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,199
We're clear upstairs, sir.
You need to go.

110
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,668
<i>Director?</i>

111
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,419
Director Fury, do you copy?

112
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:12,089
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.

113
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,424
I have men down. Hill?

114
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,010
A lot of men still under.

115
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,929
I don't know how many survivors.

116
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:20,305
<i>Sound a general call.</i>

117
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,015
I want every living soul
not working rescue

118
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,100
looking for that briefcase.

119
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,268
Roger that.

120
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:27,813
Coulson, get back to base.
This is a Level Seven.

121
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,691
<i>As of right now,</i>

122
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,150
we are at war.

123
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,445
What do we do?

124
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:15,777
This is not how I wanted this evening
to go.

125
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,654
I know how you wanted this evening
to go.

126
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:18,864
Believe me

127
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:19,990
this is better.

128
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,868
Who are you working for?

129
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,828
Lermentov, yes?

130
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,457
Does he think

131
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,334
we have to go through him

132
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,336
to move our cargo?

133
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:38,383
I thought General Solohob
is in charge of the export business.

134
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,761
Solohob

135
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,013
a bag man, a front.

136
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,645
Your outdated information betrays you.

137
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,815
The famous Black Widow

138
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:59,821
and she turns out to be
simply another pretty face.

139
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,867
You really think I'm pretty?

140
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,830
Tell Lermentov we don't need him

141
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:12,709
to move the tanks.

142
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:16,296
Tell him he is out.

143
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:18,340
Well...

144
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:22,803
...you may have to write it down.

145
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,397
It's for her.

146
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,151
You listen carefully

147
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,529
<i>You're at 1-14
Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.</i>

148
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,031
<i>We have an F-22
exactly eight miles out.</i>

149
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,993
<i>Put the woman on the phone,
or I will blow up the block</i>

150
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,161
<i>before you can make the lobby.</i>

151
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,920
- <i>We need you to come in.</i>
- Are you kidding? I'm working.

152
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,255
<i>This takes precedence.</i>

153
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,257
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

154
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,009
This moron is giving me everything.

155
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,053
I don't give everything.

156
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:07,889
Look, you can't pull me
out of this right now.

157
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:08,974
<i>Natasha...</i>

158
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:12,060
Barton's been compromised.

159
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,315
Let me put you on hold.

160
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,025
Where is Barton now?

161
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:01,485
- <i>We don't know.</i>
- But he's alive?

162
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,529
We think so. I'll brief you on
everything when you get back.

163
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,990
But first, we need you to
talk to the big guy.

164
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:10,327
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
about as far as he can throw me.

165
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:13,663
I've got Stark. You get the big guy.

166
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:39,689
Who are you?

167
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,316
Get out!

168
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,944
There is sickness here!

169
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,028
You're a doctor.

170
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,073
My father's not waking up!

171
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,783
He has a fever and he's moaning

172
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,034
but his eyes won't open.

173
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,119
Slow down.

174
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:54,663
My father...

175
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:58,333
Like them?

176
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,630
Please.

177
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,118
You should've got paid
up front, Banner.

178
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,619
You know, for a man

179
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:35,996
who's supposed to be avoiding stress

180
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:39,249
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

181
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,336
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

182
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,755
Then what is it? Yoga?

183
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,510
You brought me to the edge of
the city. Smart.

184
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:55,140
I assume the whole place
is surrounded.

185
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:56,975
Just you and me.

186
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,270
And your actress buddy?

187
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:02,189
Is she a spy, too?
They start that young?

188
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,107
I did.

189
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,358
Who are you?

190
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,443
Natasha Romanoff.

191
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,364
Are you here to kill me, Ms Romanoff?

192
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,117
Because that's not going to
work out for everyone.

193
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,620
No, of course not. I'm here
on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

194
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,040
S.H.I.E.L.D.

195
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:22,959
How did they find me?

196
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,544
We never lost you, Doctor.

197
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,087
We've kept our distance.

198
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:27,881
Even helped keep some other
interested parties

199
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,090
off your scent.

200
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:30,717
Why?

201
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,220
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

202
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,721
But now we need you to come in.

203
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,599
What if I say no?

204
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,018
I'll persuade you.

205
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:46,691
And what if the other guy says no?

206
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,027
You've been more than a year
without an incident.

207
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:51,488
I don't think you want to
break that streak.

208
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,660
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

209
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,621
Doctor, we're facing a potential
global catastrophe.

210
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:03,583
Well, those I actively try to avoid.

211
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,253
This

212
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,546
is the Tesseract.

213
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:11,508
It has the potential energy
to wipe out the planet.

214
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,513
What does Fury want me to do,
swallow it?

215
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,266
He wants you to find it. It's been taken.

216
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:24,521
It emits a gamma signature
that's too weak for us to trace.

217
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:27,649
There's no one that knows
gamma radiation like you do.

218
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,318
If there was, that's where I'd be.

219
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,154
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

220
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:34,864
Not that he's told me.

221
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:37,242
And he tells you everything?

222
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,494
Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.

223
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,745
He needs me in a cage?

224
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:41,788
No one's going to put you in a...

225
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:42,706
Stop lying to me!

226
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,587
I'm sorry. That was mean.

227
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,716
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

228
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,886
Why don't we do this the easy way

229
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,346
where you don't use that

230
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:02,225
and the other guy
doesn't make a mess.

231
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,561
Okay?

232
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,896
Natasha?

233
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:13,611
Stand down.

234
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,114
<i>We're good here.</i>

235
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,242
"Just you and me."

236
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,247
<i>This is out of line, Director.</i>

237
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,875
<i>You're dealing
with forces you can't control.</i>

238
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,754
You ever been in a war,
Councilman? In a firefight?

239
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,757
Did you feel
an overabundance of control?

240
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,344
<i>You're saying that this Asgard
is declaring war on our planet?</i>

241
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,096
Not Asgard. Loki.

242
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,099
<i>He can't be working alone.
What about the other one?</i>

243
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,267
<i>His brother.</i>

244
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,311
Our intelligence says
Thor is not a hostile

245
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:47,604
but he's worlds away.

246
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,606
We can't depend on him to help, either.

247
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,690
It's up to us.

248
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:53,443
<i>Which is why you
should be focusing on Phase 2.</i>

249
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,778
<i>It was designed for exactly this...</i>

250
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,947
Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.

251
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,116
We need a response team.

252
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,452
<i>The Avengers Initiative was shut down.</i>

253
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,454
This isn't about the Avengers.

254
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:05,955
<i>We've seen the list.</i>

255
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,375
<i>You're running the world's greatest
covert security network</i>

256
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,126
<i>and you're going to leave
the fate of the human race</i>

257
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,544
<i>to a handful of freaks.</i>

258
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,588
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

259
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,673
We need a response team.

260
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,968
These people may be isolated,
unbalanced even

261
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:23,223
but I believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need.

262
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:24,974
<i>You believe?</i>

263
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,478
<i>War isn't won by sentiment, Director.</i>

264
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:32,816
No, it's won by soldiers.

265
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:53,795
<i>There's not enough time.</i>

266
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,672
<i>I got to put her in the water!</i>

267
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,011
<i>You won't be alone.</i>

268
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,013
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

269
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,849
<i>This guy is still alive!</i>

270
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:32,625
Trouble sleeping?

271
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,379
I slept for 70 years, sir.
I think I've had my fill.

272
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:41,801
Then you should be out,
celebrating, seeing the world.

273
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,768
When I went under,
the world was at war.

274
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,479
I wake up, they say we won.

275
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,731
They didn't say what we lost.

276
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:57,692
We've made some mistakes
along the way.

277
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,736
Some, very recently.

278
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:02,822
Are you here with a mission, sir?

279
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:03,948
I am.

280
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,450
Trying to get me back in the world?

281
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,619
Trying to save it.

282
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,584
HYDRA's secret weapon.

283
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,544
Howard Stark fished that
out of the ocean

284
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:17,795
when he was looking for you.

285
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,964
He thought what we think.

286
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:24,385
The Tesseract could be the key
to unlimited sustainable energy.

287
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:28,723
That's something
the world sorely needs.

288
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:31,684
Who took it from you?

289
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,311
He's called Loki.

290
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,772
He's not from around here.

291
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:38,691
There's a lot we'll have to
bring you up to speed on

292
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,026
if you're in.

293
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:42,654
The world has gotten even stranger

294
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:43,905
than you already know.

295
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:46,991
At this point, I doubt
anything would surprise me.

296
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,285
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

297
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,705
There's a debriefing packet

298
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,208
waiting for you back at your apartment.

299
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:59,337
Is there anything you can
tell us about the Tesseract

300
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:00,838
that we ought to know now?

301
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,466
You should have left it in the ocean.

302
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:39,043
<i>Good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.</i>

303
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,587
<i>You disconnected
the transmission lines?</i>

304
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,754
<i>Are we off the grid?</i>

305
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:44,007
Stark Tower is about to become
a beacon

306
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,466
of self-sustaining clean energy.

307
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:47,802
<i>Well, assuming
the arc reactor takes over</i>

308
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,178
<i>and it actually works.</i>

309
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,805
<i>I assume.</i>

310
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:52,015
Light her up.

311
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:58,855
<i>How does it look?</i>

312
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,691
Like Christmas, but with more me.

313
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,484
<i>We've got to go wider on
the public awareness campaign.</i>

314
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:04,652
<i>You need to do some press.</i>

315
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,321
<i>I'm in DC tomorrow,</i>

316
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:07,905
<i>I'm working on the zoning
for the next three buildings.</i>

317
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:10,199
<i>Pepper, you're killing me.
The moment, remember?</i>

318
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:11,868
<i>Enjoy the moment.</i>

319
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:12,952
<i>Get in here and I will.</i>

320
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:19,459
<i>Sir, Agent Coulson of
S.H.I.E.L.D. is on the line.</i>

321
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,044
<i>I'm not in.</i>

322
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,046
I'm actually out.

323
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:32,889
<i>Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.</i>

324
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:35,516
Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.

325
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:43,316
Levels are holding steady, I think.

326
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:45,693
Of course they are.
I was directly involved.

327
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,070
Which brings me to my next question.

328
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,238
How does it feel to be a genius?

329
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,658
Well, I really wouldn't know,
now would I?

330
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:56,371
What do you mean?
All this came from you.

331
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:59,916
No, all this came from that.

332
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,502
Give yourself some credit. Please.

333
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:04,712
Stark Tower is your baby.

334
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:07,006
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

335
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:08,633
12%?

336
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:09,967
An argument can be made for 15.

337
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:11,844
12%? My baby?

338
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,680
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

339
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,264
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

340
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:18,184
And, sorry, but the security snafu?

341
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,769
That was on you.

342
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,813
- My private elevator...
- You mean our elevator?

343
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,857
...it was teeming with sweaty workmen.

344
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,443
I'm going to pay for that
comment about percentages

345
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,237
in some subtle way later, aren't I?

346
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,280
It's not going to be that subtle.

347
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:32,740
I'll tell you what.

348
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:35,201
The next building is gonna
say "Potts" on the tower.

349
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,744
On the lease.

350
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,039
Call your mom. Can you bunk over?

351
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,499
<i>Sir, the telephone.</i>

352
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,127
<i>I'm afraid my protocols
are being overridden.</i>

353
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,003
<i>Mr Stark, we need to talk.</i>

354
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,673
You have reached the life
model decoy of Tony Stark.

355
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,967
- Please leave a message.
- <i>This is urgent.</i>

356
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,094
Then leave it urgently.

357
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:55,805
Security breach. It's on you.

358
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:58,599
- Mr Stark.
- Phil! Come in.

359
00:25:58,683 --> 00:25:59,684
"Phil"?

360
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:00,852
I can't stay.

361
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:02,437
His first name is "Agent."

362
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,188
Come on in. We're celebrating.

363
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:06,107
Which is why he can't stay.

364
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,484
We need you to look this over
as soon as possible.

365
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:09,694
I don't like being handed things.

366
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:11,154
That's fine, because
I love to be handed things.

367
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,697
So, let's trade.

368
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,783
Thank you.

369
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:19,036
Official consulting hours
are between 8 and 5

370
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,121
every other Thursday.

371
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:21,497
This isn't a consultation.

372
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:22,665
Is this about the Avengers?

373
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,168
Which I know nothing about.

374
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,879
The Avengers Initiative
was scrapped, I thought.

375
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,297
And I didn't even qualify.

376
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,381
I didn't know that either.

377
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,718
Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed,

378
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:34,927
don't play well with others.

379
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,387
That I did know.

380
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,181
This isn't about personality
profiles any more.

381
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:40,683
Whatever. Ms Potts, got a second?

382
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:41,851
Half a mo.

383
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,275
You know, I thought we were
having a moment.

384
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:50,985
I was having 12% of a moment.

385
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:54,947
This seems serious.
Phil's pretty shaken.

386
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,116
How would you know if it's...
Why is he "Phil"?

387
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:59,076
What is all this?

388
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:00,870
This is

389
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:02,497
this.

390
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:10,963
I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.

391
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,173
Tomorrow.

392
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,717
You have homework.
You have a lot of homework.

393
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,761
Well, what if I didn't?

394
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:18,763
- If you didn't?
- Yeah.

395
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,140
You mean when you've finished?

396
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:25,520
Well, then...

397
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:31,734
Square deal. Fly safe.

398
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:37,365
Work hard.

399
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,994
So, any chance
you're driving by LaGuardia?

400
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,956
- I can drop you.
- Fantastic.

401
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,082
I want to hear

402
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:47,917
about the cellist. Is that still a thing?

403
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:49,252
She moved back to Portland.

404
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,129
What? Boo!

405
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:03,015
We're about 40 minutes
out from home base, sir.

406
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:10,398
So, this Dr Banner was trying
to replicate the serum they used on me?

407
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,149
A lot of people were.

408
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,776
You were the world's first superhero.

409
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:17,446
Banner thought gamma radiation
might hold the key to unlocking

410
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,781
Erskine's original formula.

411
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,075
Didn't really go his way, did it?

412
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,202
Not so much.

413
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,955
When he's not that thing, though,
the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

414
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,459
He's like a smart person.

415
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,880
I gotta say,

416
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:36,465
it's an honour to meet you officially.

417
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,135
I've sort of met you. I mean,

418
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,803
I watched you while you were sleeping.

419
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,141
I mean, I was present

420
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:48,644
while you were
unconscious from the ice.

421
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,105
You know, it's really just a huge honour

422
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,940
to have you on board this...

423
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:55,443
I hope I'm the man for the job.

424
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,529
Oh, you are. Absolutely.

425
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:01,657
We made some modifications
to the uniform.

426
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,326
I had a little design input.

427
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,744
The uniform?

428
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,496
Aren't the stars and stripes a little

429
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:09,832
old-fashioned?

430
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,752
With everything that's happening

431
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,503
and the things that are about
to come to light,

432
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:18,966
people might just need
a little old-fashioned.

433
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:54,710
The Chitauri grow restless.

434
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:56,629
Let them gird themselves.

435
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,381
I will lead them in the glorious battle.

436
00:29:58,464 --> 00:29:59,548
Battle?

437
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:03,803
Against the meagre might of Earth?

438
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,847
Glorious, not lengthy.

439
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:10,893
If your force
is as formidable as you claim.

440
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,312
You question us?

441
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,898
You question him,

442
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,526
he who put the sceptre in your hand?

443
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:21,404
Who gave you ancient knowledge
and new purpose

444
00:30:21,654 --> 00:30:24,824
when you were cast out, defeated?

445
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:26,826
I was a king!

446
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:29,245
The rightful king of Asgard,

447
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,413
betrayed.

448
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,916
Your ambition is little

449
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,752
and born of childish need.

450
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:39,213
We look beyond the Earth

451
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,133
to the greater worlds
the Tesseract will unveil.

452
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,093
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

453
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:47,805
I don't threaten.

454
00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:52,184
But until I open the doors,

455
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:56,022
until your force is mine to command,

456
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:58,566
you are but words.

457
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:02,737
You will have your war, Asgardian.

458
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,532
If you fail,

459
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:11,954
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

460
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:16,500
there will be no realm, no barren moon,

461
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:20,004
no crevice where he cannot find you.

462
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:24,341
You think you know pain?

463
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:29,930
He will make you long
for something sweet as pain.

464
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,461
Stow the captain's gear.

465
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:01,587
Yes, sir.

466
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:06,258
Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.

467
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,760
- Ma'am.
- Hi.

468
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:08,928
They need you on the bridge.

469
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:10,554
They're starting the face-trace.

470
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:11,847
See you there.

471
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:17,436
It was quite the buzz around here,
finding you in the ice.

472
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,606
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

473
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:23,692
Did he ask you to sign
his Captain America trading cards yet?

474
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:25,111
Trading cards?

475
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,279
They're vintage. He's very proud.

476
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:30,533
Dr Banner.

477
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:33,536
Yeah, hi.

478
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,287
They told me you would be coming.

479
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:36,705
Word is, you can find the Cube.

480
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:39,667
Is that the only word on me?

481
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:41,252
Only word I care about.

482
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,465
It must be strange for you, all of this.

483
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:49,969
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

484
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:52,721
Gentlemen, you might want
to step inside in a minute.

485
00:32:53,097 --> 00:32:55,891
It's going to get a little hard to breathe.

486
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,394
<i>Flight crew, secure the deck.</i>

487
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:04,775
Is this a submarine?

488
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,318
Really?

489
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:10,239
They want me in a submerged,
pressurised, metal container?

490
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:38,642
No, no, this is much worse.

491
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,508
Hover power check complete.
Position cyclic.

492
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,802
Increase collective to 8.0%.

493
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:21,518
Preparing for maximum
performance takeoff.

494
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:23,145
Increase output to capacity.

495
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,439
Power plant performing at capacity.

496
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,149
We are clear.

497
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:28,817
All engines operating.

498
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:33,656
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency
Protocol 193.6 in effect.

499
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:36,492
- We are at level, sir.
- Good.

500
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:37,826
Let's vanish.

501
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,162
Engage retro-reflection panels.

502
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,221
Reflection panels engaged.

503
00:34:57,972 --> 00:34:59,390
Gentlemen.

504
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,528
Doctor, thank you for coming.

505
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,740
Thanks for asking nicely.

506
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,368
So, how long am I staying?

507
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,328
Once we get our hands on
the Tesseract,

508
00:35:21,412 --> 00:35:22,663
you're in the wind.

509
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:24,623
Where are you with that?

510
00:35:24,707 --> 00:35:26,542
We're sweeping every
wirelessly accessible

511
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,626
camera on the planet.

512
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,212
Cell phones, laptops...

513
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:34,049
If it's connected to a satellite,
it's eyes and ears for us.

514
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:35,426
That's still not gonna find them in time.

515
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:36,593
You have to narrow your field.

516
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,762
How many spectrometers
do you have access to?

517
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:40,889
- How many are there?
- Call every lab you know.

518
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,808
Tell them to put
the spectrometers on the roof

519
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,226
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

520
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:47,521
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm,
basic cluster recognition.

521
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:50,274
At least we could rule out a few places.

522
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:52,568
Do you have somewhere
for me to work?

523
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:53,944
Agent Romanoff,

524
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:56,155
could you show Dr Banner
to his laboratory, please?

525
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:59,491
You're gonna love it, Doc.
We got all the toys.

526
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:02,077
Put it over there.

527
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:06,165
Where did you find all these people?

528
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:09,168
S.H.I.E.L.D. has no shortage
of enemies, Doctor.

529
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:10,919
Is this the stuff you need?

530
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,087
Yeah, iridium.

531
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:14,840
It's found in meteorites.
It forms anti-protons.

532
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:16,675
It's very hard to get hold of.

533
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,552
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D.
knows you need it.

534
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,054
Well, I didn't know.

535
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,430
Hey!

536
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:23,724
The Tesseract has shown me so much.

537
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,185
It's more than knowledge. It's truth.

538
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:27,269
I know.

539
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:29,897
What did it show you, Agent Barton?

540
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,441
My next target.

541
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,525
Tell me what you need.

542
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:39,073
I need a distraction.

543
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:41,283
And an eyeball.

544
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:50,542
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

545
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:51,710
No, no. It's fine.

546
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,632
It's a vintage set.

547
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:59,093
It took me a couple of years
to collect them all.

548
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:02,721
Near mint.

549
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,306
Slight foxing around the edges, but...

550
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:06,892
We got a hit. A 67% match.

551
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:08,936
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

552
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:11,313
Location?

553
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:14,483
Stuttgart, Germany. 28 Königstrasse.

554
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:15,818
He's not exactly hiding.

555
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:16,985
Captain,

556
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:18,487
you're up.

557
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,269
Kneel before me.

558
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,024
I said

559
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,987
kneel!

560
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:17,958
Is not this simpler?

561
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:22,713
Is this not your natural state?

562
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:28,218
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

563
00:40:28,385 --> 00:40:30,804
that you crave subjugation.

564
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:35,142
The bright lure of freedom
diminishes your life's joy

565
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:37,769
in a mad scramble for power,

566
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,189
for identity.

567
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:46,194
You were made to be ruled.

568
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,113
In the end,

569
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,657
you will always kneel.

570
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:00,042
Not to men like you.

571
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:03,003
There are no men like me.

572
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:06,840
There are always men like you.

573
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:09,885
Look to your elder, people.

574
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,597
Let him be an example.

575
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:23,148
You know, the last time
I was in Germany,

576
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:26,568
and saw a man standing
above everybody else,

577
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:28,236
we ended up disagreeing.

578
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,072
The soldier.

579
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,533
The man out of time.

580
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:35,243
I'm not the one who's out of time.

581
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:41,249
<i>Loki, drop the weapon
and stand down.</i>

582
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:03,522
Kneel.

583
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:04,815
Not today!

584
00:42:06,942 --> 00:42:08,151
The guy's all over the place.

585
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:14,032
<i>Agent Romanoff You miss me?</i>

586
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:33,093
<i>Make your move, Reindeer Games.</i>

587
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,310
<i>Good move.</i>

588
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,355
Mr Stark.

589
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:47,190
<i>Captain.</i>

590
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:56,032
<i>Is he saying anything?</i>

591
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,200
Not a word.

592
00:42:57,743 --> 00:42:59,578
<i>Just get him here. We're low on time.</i>

593
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:03,582
I don't like it.

594
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:06,001
What, Rock of Ages
giving up so easily?

595
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:07,836
I don't remember it being that easy.

596
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:09,588
This guy packs a wallop.

597
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:13,383
Still, you are pretty spry
for an older fellow.

598
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:15,927
What's your thing, Pilates?

599
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,012
What?

600
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,263
It's like calisthenics.

601
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,348
You might have missed
a couple of things

602
00:43:20,432 --> 00:43:22,100
doing time as a Capsicle.

603
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:25,854
Fury didn't tell me
he was calling you in.

604
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:28,732
Yeah, there's a lot of things
Fury doesn't tell you.

605
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,734
Where's this coming from?

606
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:37,282
What's the matter? Are you
scared of a little lightning?

607
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:40,035
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

608
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,054
What are you doing?

609
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:13,652
<i>And now there's that guy.</i>

610
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:15,612
Another Asgardian?

611
00:44:15,779 --> 00:44:17,656
- That guy's a friendly?
- <i>Doesn't matter.</i>

612
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:20,450
<i>If he frees Loki or kills him,
the Tesseract's lost.</i>

613
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,369
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

614
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,830
<i>I have a plan. Attack.</i>

615
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:32,671
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

616
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:34,005
I don't see how I can.

617
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:36,675
These guys come from legend.
They're basically gods.

618
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:38,593
There's only one God, ma'am.

619
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:41,096
And I'm pretty sure
he doesn't dress like that.

620
00:44:56,528 --> 00:44:57,779
Where is the Tesseract?

621
00:44:58,113 --> 00:44:59,447
I missed you, too.

622
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:01,116
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

623
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,118
You should thank me.

624
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:05,954
With the Bifrost gone,
how much dark energy

625
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:08,874
did the All father have to
muster to conjure you here

626
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,208
to your precious Earth?

627
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:15,714
I thought you dead.

628
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:18,758
Did you mourn?

629
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:20,969
We all did. Our father...

630
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:24,180
Your father.

631
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:29,185
He did tell you
my true parentage, did he not?

632
00:45:31,688 --> 00:45:33,982
We were raised together.

633
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:36,818
We played together,
we fought together.

634
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:38,528
Do you remember none of that?

635
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:40,697
I remember a shadow.

636
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:44,868
Living in the shade of your greatness.

637
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:48,580
I remember you tossing me
into an abyss.

638
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:50,707
I, who was, and should be, king!

639
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:53,001
So you take the world I love
as a recompense

640
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:55,003
for your imagined slights?

641
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:58,256
No. The Earth is under
my protection, Loki.

642
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:02,969
And you're doing
a marvellous job with that.

643
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:05,722
The humans slaughter
each other in droves

644
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,641
while you idly fret.

645
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:09,935
I mean to rule them,
as why should I not?

646
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,394
You think yourself above them?

647
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:13,772
Well, yes.

648
00:46:13,939 --> 00:46:16,441
Then you miss the truth
of ruling, brother.

649
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:18,360
A throne would suit you ill.

650
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:26,368
I've seen worlds
you've never known about!

651
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:30,830
I have grown, Odinson, in my exile.

652
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:33,375
I have seen the true power
of the Tesseract,

653
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:34,626
and when I wield it...

654
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:36,544
Who showed you this power?

655
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:38,964
Who controls the would-be king?

656
00:46:39,214 --> 00:46:41,049
- I am a king!
- Not here!

657
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:42,509
You give up the Tesseract!

658
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:45,220
You give up this poisonous dream!

659
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:49,057
You come home.

660
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:55,146
I don't have it.

661
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:59,359
You need the Cube to bring me home.

662
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:01,444
But I've sent it off, I know not where.

663
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:04,698
You listen well, brother.

664
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:07,534
I'm listening.

665
00:47:16,918 --> 00:47:18,378
Do not touch me again.

666
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,171
Then don't take my stuff.

667
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:22,590
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

668
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:25,468
Shakespeare in the Park?

669
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:30,098
Doth Mother know
you wear-eth her drapes?

670
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:33,268
This is beyond you, metal man.

671
00:47:33,435 --> 00:47:35,228
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

672
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,149
He gives up the Cube,
he's all yours. Until then,

673
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:40,525
<i>stay out of the way.</i>

674
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,903
<i>Tourist.</i>

675
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:50,201
Okay.

676
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:23,151
<i>Power at 400% capacity.</i>

677
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:24,569
How about that?

678
00:49:24,921 --> 00:49:26,214
Hey!

679
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,176
That's enough.

680
00:49:33,847 --> 00:49:35,515
Now, I don't know
what you plan on doing here.

681
00:49:35,598 --> 00:49:38,143
I've come here to put an end
to Loki's schemes.

682
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:40,687
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.

683
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:41,771
Yeah... No.

684
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:43,481
<i>Bad call. He loves his hammer.</i>

685
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,402
You want me to put the hammer down?

686
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,681
Are we done, here?

687
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,523
In case it's unclear,

688
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:10,026
if you try to escape,

689
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,196
if you so much as scratch that glass,

690
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:26,709
it's 30,000 feet straight down
in a steel trap.

691
00:51:27,502 --> 00:51:29,671
You get how that works?

692
00:51:31,673 --> 00:51:34,342
Ant, boot.

693
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:39,180
It's an impressive cage.

694
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:42,684
Not built, I think, for me.

695
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:45,186
Built for something
a lot stronger than you.

696
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:47,855
Oh, I've heard.

697
00:51:48,523 --> 00:51:49,732
<i>A mindless beast.</i>

698
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:52,360
<i>Makes play he's still a man.</i>

699
00:51:53,695 --> 00:51:55,947
<i>How desperate are you,</i>

700
00:51:56,114 --> 00:51:59,242
<i>that you call on such
lost creatures to defend you?</i>

701
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:01,536
<i>How desperate am I?</i>

702
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:03,830
You threaten my world with war.

703
00:52:03,997 --> 00:52:06,165
You steal a force
you can't hope to control.

704
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:10,169
You talk about peace,
and you kill because it's fun.

705
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:13,381
You have made me very desperate.

706
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:15,300
You might not be glad that you did.

707
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,056
It burns you to have come so close.

708
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:25,893
To have the Tesseract, to have power,

709
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:29,230
unlimited power.

710
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:31,399
And for what?

711
00:52:32,984 --> 00:52:36,612
A warm light for all mankind to share.

712
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:40,199
And then to be reminded
what real power is.

713
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:48,499
Well, let me know if "real power"
wants a magazine or something.

714
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:58,468
He really grows on you, doesn't he?

715
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,595
Loki's gonna drag this out.

716
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:04,265
So, Thor, what's his play?

717
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:07,060
He has an army called the Chitauri.

718
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:10,146
They're not of Asgard,
nor any world known.

719
00:53:10,563 --> 00:53:12,690
He means to lead them
against your people.

720
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:14,484
They will win him the Earth,

721
00:53:14,567 --> 00:53:16,402
in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

722
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:18,321
An army

723
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:20,239
from outer space.

724
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:22,825
So, he's building another portal.

725
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:24,285
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

726
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:25,370
Selvig?

727
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,039
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.

728
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:30,375
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

729
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:32,001
along with one of ours.

730
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:33,836
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

731
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,254
He's not leading an army from here.

732
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:37,131
I don't think
we should be focusing on Loki.

733
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:39,175
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

734
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:40,510
You could smell crazy on him.

735
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,428
Have care how you speak.

736
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:44,972
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard.

737
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:46,599
And he is my brother.

738
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:48,684
He killed 80 people in two days.

739
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:50,645
He's adopted.

740
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:53,189
I think it's about the mechanics.

741
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:55,358
Iridium... What do they
need the iridium for?

742
00:53:55,483 --> 00:53:56,484
It's a stabilising agent.

743
00:53:56,692 --> 00:53:58,027
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

744
00:53:58,152 --> 00:53:59,695
I'll fly you to Portland.

745
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:01,489
Keep love alive.

746
00:54:01,656 --> 00:54:03,574
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself

747
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:05,576
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

748
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:09,038
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You've got a mean swing.

749
00:54:09,205 --> 00:54:11,499
Also, it means the portal
can open as wide

750
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:14,168
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

751
00:54:14,836 --> 00:54:16,838
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

752
00:54:18,548 --> 00:54:19,757
That man is playing <i>Galaga.</i>

753
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:24,387
He thought we wouldn't notice,
but we did.

754
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,557
How does Fury even see these?

755
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,683
He turns.

756
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:30,852
Sounds exhausting.

757
00:54:31,853 --> 00:54:33,104
The rest of the raw materials,

758
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:36,065
Agent Barton can get
his hands on pretty easily.

759
00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:37,692
The only major component
he still needs

760
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:41,362
is a power source
of high-energy density.

761
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:44,657
Something to kick-start the Cube.

762
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,743
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

763
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:48,911
Last night.

764
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:52,915
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the extraction theory papers.

765
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:54,125
Am I the only one who did the reading?

766
00:54:54,292 --> 00:54:57,086
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

767
00:54:57,253 --> 00:55:00,047
He would have to heat the Cube
to 120-million Kelvin

768
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:01,716
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

769
00:55:01,883 --> 00:55:04,135
Unless Selvig has figured out
how to stabilise

770
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:05,428
the quantum tunnelling effect.

771
00:55:05,595 --> 00:55:06,804
Well, if he could do that,

772
00:55:06,888 --> 00:55:09,348
he could achieve heavy ion fusion
at any reactor on the planet.

773
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:11,893
Finally, someone who speaks English.

774
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,936
Is that what just happened?

775
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,272
It's good to meet you, Dr Banner.

776
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:19,567
Your work on antielectron
collisions is unparalleled.

777
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:21,569
And I'm a huge fan of the way
you lose control

778
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:23,613
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

779
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:26,407
Thanks.

780
00:55:26,574 --> 00:55:29,076
Dr Banner is only here
to track the Cube.

781
00:55:29,243 --> 00:55:30,578
I was hoping you might join him.

782
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:31,746
I would start with that stick of his.

783
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,039
It may be magical,

784
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:34,582
but it works an awful lot
like a HYDRA weapon.

785
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:37,585
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the Cube.

786
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,712
And I would like to know
how Loki used it

787
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:41,589
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

788
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,424
into his personal flying monkeys.

789
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:45,301
Monkeys? I do not understand.

790
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:46,385
I do.

791
00:55:49,472 --> 00:55:51,098
I understood that reference.

792
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:53,643
Shall we play, Doctor?

793
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,436
This way, sir.

794
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:11,118
The gamma readings
are definitely consistent

795
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:13,079
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

796
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,373
But it's going to take weeks to process.

797
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,791
If we bypass their mainframe

798
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,167
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

799
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:21,462
we can clock this
at around 600 teraflops.

800
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:24,632
All I packed was a toothbrush.

801
00:56:25,633 --> 00:56:27,301
You know, you should come by
Stark Tower sometime.

802
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:29,470
Top ten floors, all R&D.

803
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:31,305
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

804
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:34,058
Thanks, but the last time
I was in New York,

805
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:36,811
I kind of broke Harlem.

806
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:38,813
Well, I promise
a stress-free environment.

807
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,815
No tension, no surprises.

808
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:43,734
- Hey!
- Nothing?

809
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:44,902
Are you nuts?

810
00:56:44,986 --> 00:56:45,987
Jury's out.

811
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:47,405
You really have got
a lid on it, haven't you?

812
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:48,489
What's your secret?

813
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:50,074
Mellow jazz, bongo drums,
huge bag of weed?

814
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:51,158
Is everything a joke to you?

815
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:52,618
Funny things are.

816
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:54,579
Threatening the safety
of everyone on this ship

817
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:55,955
isn't funny.

818
00:56:56,038 --> 00:56:57,039
No offence, Doc.

819
00:56:57,123 --> 00:56:58,749
It's all right,
I wouldn't have come aboard

820
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:01,711
if I couldn't handle pointy things.

821
00:57:01,794 --> 00:57:04,171
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.

822
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:06,215
And you need to focus
on the problem, Mr Stark.

823
00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:07,675
Do you think I'm not?

824
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,761
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

825
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:12,555
What isn't he telling us?

826
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,181
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

827
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:16,142
You think Fury's hiding something?

828
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:19,645
He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.

829
00:57:19,729 --> 00:57:21,564
His secrets have secrets.

830
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:23,190
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

831
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,861
I just want to finish my work here, and...

832
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:28,529
Doctor?

833
00:57:34,035 --> 00:57:36,454
"A warm light for all mankind."

834
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:38,539
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

835
00:57:38,748 --> 00:57:39,999
I heard it.

836
00:57:40,082 --> 00:57:42,418
I think that was meant for you.

837
00:57:43,336 --> 00:57:46,339
Even if Barton didn't
tell Loki about the tower,

838
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:47,465
it was still all over the news.

839
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:49,634
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly

840
00:57:50,885 --> 00:57:52,094
building in New York?

841
00:57:52,428 --> 00:57:56,182
It's powered by an arc reactor,
a self-sustaining energy source.

842
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:58,768
That building will run itself
for, what, a year?

843
00:57:58,851 --> 00:58:00,686
It's just the prototype.

844
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:02,647
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

845
00:58:03,064 --> 00:58:04,482
That's what he's getting at.

846
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:07,234
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. bring him in
on the Tesseract project?

847
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,195
What are they doing
in the energy business

848
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:10,571
in the first place?

849
00:58:10,738 --> 00:58:13,741
I should probably look into that
once my decryption programme

850
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:15,826
finishes breaking into all of
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

851
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:16,869
I'm sorry. Did you say...

852
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:19,080
Jarvis has been running it
since I hit the bridge.

853
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:20,998
In a few hours,
I'll know every dirty secret

854
00:58:21,082 --> 00:58:22,333
S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide.

855
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:23,376
Blueberry?

856
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:25,211
Yet you're confused about why
they didn't want you around.

857
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:28,172
An intelligence organisation
that fears intelligence?

858
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:30,132
Historically, not awesome.

859
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:32,510
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

860
00:58:32,593 --> 00:58:34,220
This is a man who means to start a war

861
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:35,763
and if we don't stay focused,
he'll succeed.

862
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:39,558
We have orders.
We should follow them.

863
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:41,936
Following's not really my style.

864
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:45,731
And you're all about style, aren't you?

865
00:58:45,815 --> 00:58:46,899
Of the people in this room,

866
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:48,651
which one is,
A, wearing a spangly outfit,

867
00:58:48,734 --> 00:58:49,902
and, B, not of use?

868
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:54,281
Steve, tell me none of this
smells a little funky to you.

869
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:58,077
Just find the Cube.

870
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:12,967
That's the guy
my dad never shut up about?

871
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,429
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have
kept him on ice.

872
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:18,931
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

873
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:20,850
He does have the jump on us.

874
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:23,686
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

875
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,604
It's going to blow up in his face.

876
00:59:25,688 --> 00:59:27,815
And I'm going to be there when it does.

877
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,484
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

878
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:33,738
Or you'll be suiting up
with the rest of us.

879
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:39,076
You see, I don't get a suit of arm our.

880
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,580
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

881
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:44,165
It's a nightmare.

882
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:47,376
I've got a cluster of shrapnel
trying every second

883
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,503
to crawl its way into my heart.

884
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:51,672
This stops it.

885
00:59:51,756 --> 00:59:53,924
This little circle of light,
it's part of me now,

886
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:56,844
not just arm our.

887
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:59,930
It's a terrible privilege.

888
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:02,683
- But you can control it.
- Because I learned how.

889
01:00:02,767 --> 01:00:03,768
It's different.

890
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:07,605
Hey, I read all about your accident.

891
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:10,900
That much gamma exposure
should have killed you.

892
01:00:11,192 --> 01:00:13,694
So you're saying that the Hulk...

893
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:17,281
The other guy saved my life?

894
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:18,949
That's nice.

895
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:23,704
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

896
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:26,874
I guess we'll find out.

897
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:30,419
You may not enjoy that.

898
01:00:30,503 --> 01:00:32,505
And you just might.

899
01:01:31,689 --> 01:01:33,107
<i>As soon as Loki took the doctor,</i>

900
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,984
we moved Jane Foster.

901
01:01:35,067 --> 01:01:37,486
They've got an excellent
observatory in Tromsø.

902
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:41,156
She was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday.

903
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:45,077
Handsome fee, private plane,
very remote.

904
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:46,871
She'll be safe.

905
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:48,455
Thank you.

906
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:52,084
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.

907
01:01:53,294 --> 01:01:55,713
I dread what he plans for him
once he's done.

908
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:56,964
Erik is a good man.

909
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,090
He talks about you a lot.

910
01:02:00,134 --> 01:02:02,136
You changed his life.

911
01:02:03,804 --> 01:02:05,723
You changed everything around here.

912
01:02:05,806 --> 01:02:07,975
They were better as they were.

913
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,686
We pretend on Asgard
that we're more advanced

914
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:14,523
but we come here,
battling like bilge snipe.

915
01:02:14,607 --> 01:02:16,483
- Like what?
- Bilge snipe.

916
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:19,320
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

917
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:22,239
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.

918
01:02:22,323 --> 01:02:24,241
Well, they are repulsive.

919
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:27,828
And they trample everything
in their path.

920
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:38,756
When I first came to Earth,
Loki's rage followed me here,

921
01:02:38,923 --> 01:02:41,091
and your people paid the price.

922
01:02:41,342 --> 01:02:43,177
And now, again.

923
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,182
In my youth, I courted war.

924
01:02:49,934 --> 01:02:51,977
War hasn't started yet.

925
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:54,897
You think you could make Loki tell us

926
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,273
where the Tesseract is?

927
01:02:56,357 --> 01:02:59,693
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

928
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:04,531
It's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance, upon me.

929
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:06,450
There's no pain
would prise his need from him.

930
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:10,079
A lot of guys think that

931
01:03:10,162 --> 01:03:11,413
until the pain starts.

932
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:15,459
What are you asking me to do?

933
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:19,046
I'm asking,
what are you prepared to do?

934
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:20,214
Loki is a prisoner.

935
01:03:20,464 --> 01:03:22,800
Then why do I feel like
he's the only person on this boat

936
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:24,259
that wants to be here?

937
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:40,234
There's not many people
who can sneak up on me.

938
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,902
But you figured I'd come.

939
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:44,071
After.

940
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:48,575
After whatever tortures
Fury can concoct,

941
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:52,371
you would appear
as a friend, as a balm.

942
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:54,832
And I would cooperate.

943
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:56,959
I want to know what
you've done to Agent Barton.

944
01:03:57,209 --> 01:03:59,044
I would say I've expanded his mind.

945
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:03,757
And once you've won,

946
01:04:04,258 --> 01:04:05,592
once you're king of the mountain,

947
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:10,556
what happens to his mind?

948
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:13,392
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

949
01:04:13,684 --> 01:04:16,311
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

950
01:04:20,399 --> 01:04:22,109
Tell me.

951
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:29,908
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D... I...

952
01:04:32,286 --> 01:04:36,206
Well, I made a name for myself.

953
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:39,376
I have a very specific skill set.

954
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:42,880
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

955
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:47,426
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar
in a bad way.

956
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:51,764
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

957
01:04:52,765 --> 01:04:54,141
He made a different call.

958
01:04:56,268 --> 01:04:59,146
And what will you do
if I vow to spare him?

959
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:00,981
Not let you out.

960
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:02,983
No, but I like this.

961
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:07,196
Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man.

962
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:09,573
Regimes fall every day.

963
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:12,034
I tend not to weep over that.
I'm Russian.

964
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:13,160
Or I was.

965
01:05:14,661 --> 01:05:16,163
And what are you now?

966
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:19,792
It's really not that complicated.

967
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:24,004
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.

968
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:26,340
Can you?

969
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:31,678
Can you wipe out that much red?

970
01:05:32,805 --> 01:05:34,348
Dreykov's daughter,

971
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:37,893
São Paulo,

972
01:05:38,894 --> 01:05:41,230
the hospital fire?

973
01:05:42,231 --> 01:05:44,608
Barton told me everything.

974
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:47,569
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red

975
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:50,489
and you think saving a man
no more virtuous than yourself

976
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:51,949
will change anything?

977
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:54,785
This is the basest sentimentality.

978
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:57,121
This is a child at prayer.

979
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:58,372
Pathetic!

980
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:01,959
<i>You lie and kill</i>

981
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:05,129
<i>in the service of liars and killers.</i>

982
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:11,218
<i>You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,</i>

983
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:14,221
<i>something that makes up
for the horrors.</i>

984
01:06:15,347 --> 01:06:17,808
<i>But they are part of you.</i>

985
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:21,478
<i>And they will never go away.</i>

986
01:06:22,271 --> 01:06:25,816
I won't touch Barton,
not until I make him kill you.

987
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:28,152
Slowly, intimately,

988
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:30,696
in every way he knows you fear.

989
01:06:30,779 --> 01:06:33,615
And then he'll wake just long
enough to see his good work

990
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:37,494
and when he screams, I'll split his skull.

991
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:40,414
This is my bargain, you mewling quim.

992
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:43,917
You're a monster.

993
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:47,588
Oh, no.

994
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:49,756
You brought the monster.

995
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:54,428
So, Banner.

996
01:06:55,429 --> 01:06:56,597
That's your play.

997
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:57,848
What?

998
01:06:58,849 --> 01:07:00,475
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

999
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,102
Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.

1000
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:03,270
Send Thor as well.

1001
01:07:05,314 --> 01:07:06,315
Thank you

1002
01:07:06,565 --> 01:07:08,775
for your cooperation.

1003
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:17,701
What are you doing, Mr Stark?

1004
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:20,370
Kind of been wondering
the same thing about you.

1005
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,372
You're supposed to be locating
the Tesseract.

1006
01:07:22,456 --> 01:07:23,749
We are. The model's locked

1007
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:25,500
and we're sweeping
for the signature now.

1008
01:07:25,584 --> 01:07:26,877
When we get a hit,

1009
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,462
we'll have the location
within half a mile.

1010
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:33,050
Yeah, then you get your
Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1011
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:34,176
What is "Phase 2"?

1012
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:39,389
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses
the Cube to make weapons.

1013
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:41,266
Sorry, computer was moving
a little slow for me.

1014
01:07:41,642 --> 01:07:44,061
Rogers, we gathered everything
related to the Tesseract.

1015
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:45,437
This does not mean that we're making...

1016
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,521
I'm sorry, Nick.

1017
01:07:46,605 --> 01:07:48,982
What were you lying?

1018
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:50,359
I was wrong, Director.

1019
01:07:50,484 --> 01:07:51,568
The world hasn't changed a bit.

1020
01:07:51,652 --> 01:07:52,653
Did you know about this?

1021
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:54,655
You want to think about
removing yourself

1022
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:55,864
from this environment, Doctor?

1023
01:07:55,948 --> 01:07:57,824
I was in Calcutta.
I was pretty well removed.

1024
01:07:58,116 --> 01:07:59,451
Loki is manipulating you.

1025
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,036
And you've been doing what, exactly?

1026
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,663
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

1027
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:03,997
Yes, and I'm not leaving

1028
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:05,457
because suddenly
you get a little twitchy.

1029
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:07,376
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1030
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:11,088
is using the Tesseract
to build weapons of mass destruction.

1031
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:12,965
Because of him.

1032
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:14,841
Me?

1033
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:18,595
Last year, Earth had a visitor
from another planet

1034
01:08:18,679 --> 01:08:21,890
who had a grudge match
that level led a small town.

1035
01:08:21,974 --> 01:08:24,101
We learned that
not only are we not alone

1036
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:27,938
but we are hopelessly,
hilariously, outgunned.

1037
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:30,148
My people want nothing
but peace with your planet.

1038
01:08:30,357 --> 01:08:32,401
But you're not the only people
out there, are you?

1039
01:08:32,484 --> 01:08:34,361
And you're not the only threat.

1040
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:37,531
The world's filling up with
people who can't be matched,

1041
01:08:38,198 --> 01:08:39,533
that can't be controlled.

1042
01:08:39,741 --> 01:08:40,909
Like you controlled the Cube?

1043
01:08:40,993 --> 01:08:42,286
Your work with the Tesseract

1044
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:44,955
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

1045
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:46,498
It is a signal to all the realms

1046
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:49,293
that the Earth is ready
for a higher form of war.

1047
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:50,460
A higher form?

1048
01:08:50,544 --> 01:08:51,670
You forced our hand.

1049
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:52,754
We had to come up with something.

1050
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:53,839
A nuclear deterrent.

1051
01:08:53,922 --> 01:08:56,008
Because that always
calms everything right down.

1052
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:58,510
Remind me again how
you made your fortune, Stark.

1053
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:00,762
I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck-deep...

1054
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:02,764
Hold on. How is this now about me?

1055
01:09:02,848 --> 01:09:03,974
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1056
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:06,018
I thought humans were
more evolved than this.

1057
01:09:06,101 --> 01:09:09,021
Excuse me, did we come to
your planet and blow stuff up?

1058
01:09:09,104 --> 01:09:10,981
You treat your champions
with such mistrust.

1059
01:09:11,064 --> 01:09:12,607
Are you boys really that naïve??

1060
01:09:12,691 --> 01:09:14,609
S.H.I.E.L.D. monitors potential threats.

1061
01:09:14,693 --> 01:09:16,028
Captain America's on threat watch?

1062
01:09:16,111 --> 01:09:17,112
We all are.

1063
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:18,697
Wait, you're on that list?

1064
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,365
Are you above or below angry bees?

1065
01:09:20,449 --> 01:09:22,617
Stark, so help me God,
if you make one more wisecrack...

1066
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:23,994
Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.

1067
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:26,580
- Show some respect.
- Respect what?

1068
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,882
<i>Transport Six-Six-Bravo,
please relay confirm codes.</i>

1069
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:39,176
<i>I've got you on the computer,
but not on the day log.</i>

1070
01:09:39,259 --> 01:09:41,345
<i>What is your haul? Over.</i>

1071
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:43,847
<i>Arms and ammunition. Over.</i>

1072
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:54,691
You speak of control,
yet you court chaos.

1073
01:09:54,775 --> 01:09:56,360
That's his M.O., isn't it?

1074
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:57,861
I mean, what are we, a team?

1075
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:00,989
No, we're a chemical mixture
that makes chaos.

1076
01:10:01,073 --> 01:10:02,783
We're a time bomb.

1077
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:05,035
You need to step away.

1078
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:06,995
Why shouldn't the guy
let off a little steam?

1079
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:09,206
You know damn well why. Back off!

1080
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:11,541
I'm starting to want you to make me.

1081
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:15,253
Yeah. Big man in a suit of arm our.

1082
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:16,671
Take that off, what are you?

1083
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:19,257
Genius, billionaire,
playboy, philanthropist.

1084
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:23,220
I know guys with none of that
worth ten of you.

1085
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:24,388
I've seen the footage.

1086
01:10:24,638 --> 01:10:26,640
The only thing you really
fight for is yourself.

1087
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:30,227
You're not the guy
to make the sacrifice play,

1088
01:10:30,394 --> 01:10:32,729
to lay down on a wire and let
the other guy crawl over you.

1089
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:34,898
I think I would just cut the wire.

1090
01:10:37,776 --> 01:10:40,028
Always a way out.

1091
01:10:40,112 --> 01:10:41,405
You may not be a threat

1092
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:43,323
but you better stop pretending
to be a hero.

1093
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:46,034
A hero? Like you?

1094
01:10:46,118 --> 01:10:48,203
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.

1095
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:51,706
Everything special about you
came out of a bottle.

1096
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,776
Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.

1097
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:24,531
You people are so petty and tiny.

1098
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:25,657
Yeah, this is a team.

1099
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,867
Agent Romanoff, would you escort

1100
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:27,993
Dr Banner back to his...

1101
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,828
Where? You rented my room.

1102
01:11:30,162 --> 01:11:31,788
The cell was just in case...

1103
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:33,290
In case you needed to kill me.

1104
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:36,042
But you can't. I know, I tried.

1105
01:11:39,045 --> 01:11:41,965
I got low. I didn't see an end.

1106
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:46,428
So, I put a bullet in my mouth,
and the other guy spit it out.

1107
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:48,388
So I moved on.

1108
01:11:48,472 --> 01:11:51,057
I focused on helping
other people. I was good.

1109
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:53,560
Until you dragged me back
into this freak show

1110
01:11:53,727 --> 01:11:54,895
and put everyone here at risk.

1111
01:11:55,270 --> 01:11:57,397
You want to know my secret,
Agent Romanoff?

1112
01:11:57,481 --> 01:11:59,065
You want to know how I stay calm?

1113
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:04,070
Dr Banner,

1114
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:06,323
put down the sceptre.

1115
01:12:15,165 --> 01:12:16,374
Got it.

1116
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:17,959
Sorry, kids,

1117
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:19,920
you don't get to see
my party trick after all.

1118
01:12:20,045 --> 01:12:21,087
You located the Tesseract?

1119
01:12:21,213 --> 01:12:22,214
I could get there fastest.

1120
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,466
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard.
No human is a match for it.

1121
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:25,884
- You're not going alone.
- You're gonna stop me?

1122
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:27,052
Put on the suit, let's find out.

1123
01:12:27,219 --> 01:12:28,428
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

1124
01:12:28,512 --> 01:12:29,513
Put on the suit.

1125
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:33,934
Oh, my God.

1126
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:50,700
Put on the suit.

1127
01:12:50,784 --> 01:12:52,118
Yeah.

1128
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,623
<i>All hands to stations.</i>

1129
01:13:00,752 --> 01:13:02,462
- Hill!
- <i>External detonation.</i>

1130
01:13:02,671 --> 01:13:03,964
Number three engine is down.

1131
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:05,048
We've been hit.

1132
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:06,383
- Can they get it running?
- Fire in engine three!

1133
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:07,467
Talk to me.

1134
01:13:07,551 --> 01:13:09,261
Turbine looks mostly intact

1135
01:13:09,344 --> 01:13:11,263
but it's impossible to
get out there to make repairs

1136
01:13:11,346 --> 01:13:12,806
while we're in the air.

1137
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:15,475
If we lose one more engine,
we won't be.

1138
01:13:15,559 --> 01:13:17,602
Somebody's got to get outside
and patch that engine.

1139
01:13:17,686 --> 01:13:19,145
- Stark, you copy that?
- <i>I'm on it.</i>

1140
01:13:19,521 --> 01:13:22,649
<i>Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown
in the detention section</i>

1141
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:23,817
<i>then get to the armoury.</i>

1142
01:13:23,942 --> 01:13:24,985
Romanoff?

1143
01:13:28,822 --> 01:13:29,990
We're okay.

1144
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:33,910
We're okay, right?

1145
01:13:46,715 --> 01:13:47,966
- Keep that engine down!
- Yes, sir.

1146
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:49,759
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.

1147
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:51,720
- Got it.
- Stay close.

1148
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:54,973
Let's go, Level 4.

1149
01:13:55,849 --> 01:13:58,476
Engine three. I'll meet you there.

1150
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:08,069
Doctor?

1151
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:11,031
Bruce?

1152
01:14:11,698 --> 01:14:15,118
You got to fight it.
This is just what Loki wants.

1153
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:17,621
We're going to be okay. Listen to me.

1154
01:14:17,704 --> 01:14:18,705
Are you hurt?

1155
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,169
We're going to be okay. All right?

1156
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:27,380
I swear on my life,
I will get you out of this.

1157
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:28,840
You will walk away and never ever...

1158
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:30,759
Your life?

1159
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:48,234
Bruce.

1160
01:15:25,397 --> 01:15:28,608
Bring the carrier about
to a 1-8-0, heading south!

1161
01:15:28,692 --> 01:15:30,527
- Take us to the water!
- We're flying blind.

1162
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:32,612
Navigation's recalibrating
after the engine failure.

1163
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:34,280
Is the sun coming up?

1164
01:15:35,323 --> 01:15:37,283
- Yes, sir.
- Then put it on the left.

1165
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:39,119
Get us over water.

1166
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:41,246
One more turbine goes down,
and we drop.

1167
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:45,125
Thanks.

1168
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:49,629
Stark!

1169
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:54,008
Stark, I'm here!

1170
01:15:54,092 --> 01:15:55,301
<i>Good.</i>

1171
01:15:56,803 --> 01:15:58,847
<i>Let's see what we've got.</i>

1172
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:00,557
I got to get this
superconducting coolant system

1173
01:16:00,724 --> 01:16:01,725
back online

1174
01:16:01,808 --> 01:16:03,351
before I can access the rotors,

1175
01:16:03,435 --> 01:16:05,019
work on dislodging the debris.

1176
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:09,149
<i>I need you to get to that
engine control panel</i>

1177
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:12,944
<i>and tell me which relays
are in overload position.</i>

1178
01:16:25,457 --> 01:16:26,833
<i>What does it look like in there?</i>

1179
01:16:27,709 --> 01:16:30,044
It seems to run
on some form of electricity.

1180
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:31,921
Well, you're not wrong.

1181
01:17:35,944 --> 01:17:38,655
We are not your enemies, Banner.

1182
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:39,781
Try to think!

1183
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:51,793
<i>Okay, the relays are intact.</i>

1184
01:17:52,043 --> 01:17:53,253
What's our next move?

1185
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:54,629
<i>Even if I clear the rotors,</i>

1186
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:56,881
<i>this thing won't
re-engage without a jump.</i>

1187
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:58,258
I'm going to have to
get in there and push.

1188
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,176
If that thing gets up to
speed, you'll get shredded.

1189
01:18:00,468 --> 01:18:02,512
That stator control unit
can reverse the polarity

1190
01:18:02,595 --> 01:18:03,930
long enough to disengage
Maglev and that could...

1191
01:18:04,097 --> 01:18:05,265
Speak English!

1192
01:18:06,641 --> 01:18:07,809
You see that red lever?

1193
01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:11,187
<i>It will slow the rotors down
long enough for me to get out.</i>

1194
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:13,106
Stand by it. Wait for my word.

1195
01:19:05,867 --> 01:19:07,410
We need full evac
on the lower hangar bay.

1196
01:19:10,872 --> 01:19:11,956
Grenade!

1197
01:19:27,013 --> 01:19:28,431
<i>We've got a perimeter breach!</i>

1198
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:30,600
<i>Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. gear.</i>

1199
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:32,810
<i>Call-outs at every junction.</i>

1200
01:19:40,026 --> 01:19:42,278
<i>We have the Hulk and Thor
on Research Level 4.</i>

1201
01:19:42,362 --> 01:19:43,863
<i>Levels 2 and 3 are dark.</i>

1202
01:19:44,072 --> 01:19:46,032
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

1203
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:48,201
Get his attention.

1204
01:19:48,534 --> 01:19:52,747
Escort 6-0, proceed to
Wishbone and engage hostile.

1205
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:54,165
<i>Don't get too close.</i>

1206
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:55,375
<i>Copy.</i>

1207
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:08,846
<i>Target acquired.</i>

1208
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:14,060
<i>Target engaged.</i>

1209
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:27,240
<i>Target angry, target angry!</i>

1210
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:37,894
They're not getting through
here, so what the hell...

1211
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:58,706
<i>Engine one is now in shut-down.</i>

1212
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:09,300
We are in an uncontrolled descent.

1213
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:11,094
<i>Sir, we've lost all power in engine one.</i>

1214
01:22:11,803 --> 01:22:13,679
<i>It's Barton. He took out our systems.</i>

1215
01:22:13,763 --> 01:22:16,265
<i>He's headed for the detention level.</i>

1216
01:22:16,349 --> 01:22:18,351
<i>Does anybody copy?</i>

1217
01:22:19,519 --> 01:22:21,687
This is Agent Romanoff.

1218
01:22:21,771 --> 01:22:23,272
I copy.

1219
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:28,653
<i>Stark, we're losing altitude.</i>

1220
01:22:28,986 --> 01:22:30,238
Yeah, I noticed.

1221
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:00,351
No!

1222
01:23:08,109 --> 01:23:10,528
Are you ever not going to fall for that?

1223
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:56,115
The humans think us immortal.

1224
01:23:57,158 --> 01:23:58,743
Should we test that?

1225
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,455
Move away, please.

1226
01:24:07,126 --> 01:24:08,461
You like this?

1227
01:24:09,629 --> 01:24:12,632
We started working on the prototype
after you sent the Destroyer.

1228
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:16,135
Even I don't know what it does.

1229
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:18,429
Do you want to find out?

1230
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:21,641
No!

1231
01:25:31,377 --> 01:25:32,837
Natasha?

1232
01:26:04,368 --> 01:26:06,162
You're going to lose.

1233
01:26:08,164 --> 01:26:09,248
Am I?

1234
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:13,210
It's in your nature.

1235
01:26:15,338 --> 01:26:17,715
Your heroes are scattered.

1236
01:26:17,798 --> 01:26:21,552
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

1237
01:26:21,635 --> 01:26:22,928
Where is my disadvantage?

1238
01:26:23,929 --> 01:26:25,765
You lack conviction.

1239
01:26:26,724 --> 01:26:27,767
I don't think I'm...

1240
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:36,275
So, that's what it does.

1241
01:26:38,444 --> 01:26:40,112
<i>All hands
to crash stations immediately.</i>

1242
01:27:08,933 --> 01:27:09,934
Cap, hit the lever.

1243
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:12,937
I need a minute here!

1244
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,397
Lever

1245
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,481
now!

1246
01:27:27,618 --> 01:27:28,786
<i>Help!</i>

1247
01:28:04,363 --> 01:28:05,781
Sorry, boss.

1248
01:28:05,865 --> 01:28:07,408
The god rabbited.

1249
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:09,201
Just stay awake.

1250
01:28:09,285 --> 01:28:10,744
Eyes on me.

1251
01:28:11,036 --> 01:28:12,413
No, I'm clocking out here.

1252
01:28:12,705 --> 01:28:13,873
Not an option.

1253
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:17,209
It's okay, boss.

1254
01:28:19,086 --> 01:28:21,172
This was never gonna work

1255
01:28:21,255 --> 01:28:22,423
if they didn't have something

1256
01:28:23,883 --> 01:28:25,342
to...

1257
01:28:54,538 --> 01:28:56,415
<i>Agent Coulson is down.</i>

1258
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,502
<i>A medical team is on
its way to your location.</i>

1259
01:28:59,585 --> 01:29:01,086
<i>They're here.</i>

1260
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,925
<i>They called it.</i>

1261
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:23,817
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

1262
01:29:27,154 --> 01:29:29,323
I guess he never did
get you to sign them.

1263
01:29:32,952 --> 01:29:34,662
We're dead in the air up here.

1264
01:29:34,745 --> 01:29:37,873
Our communications,
the location of the Cube,

1265
01:29:38,249 --> 01:29:40,417
Banner, Thor...

1266
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:43,629
I got nothing for you.

1267
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:46,632
I lost my one good eye.

1268
01:29:49,635 --> 01:29:52,596
Maybe I had that coming.

1269
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:58,227
Yes,

1270
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:02,731
we were going to build
an arsenal with the Tesseract.

1271
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,068
I never put all my chips
on that number, though

1272
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:09,280
because I was playing
something even riskier.

1273
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:17,329
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

1274
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:22,585
called the Avengers Initiative.

1275
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:25,921
The idea was to bring together a group

1276
01:30:26,005 --> 01:30:28,591
of remarkable people

1277
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:32,177
to see if they could become
something more.

1278
01:30:33,512 --> 01:30:37,516
To see if they could work together
when we needed them to,

1279
01:30:37,683 --> 01:30:40,978
to fight the battles that we never could.

1280
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:48,861
Phil Coulson died
still believing in that idea.

1281
01:30:51,155 --> 01:30:52,865
In heroes.

1282
01:31:00,873 --> 01:31:02,499
Well,

1283
01:31:03,334 --> 01:31:06,045
it's an old-fashioned notion.

1284
01:31:26,273 --> 01:31:28,609
<i>You fell out of the sky.</i>

1285
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:44,083
Did I hurt anybody?

1286
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:47,503
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

1287
01:31:47,586 --> 01:31:50,923
You did scare the hell
out of some pigeons, though.

1288
01:31:51,757 --> 01:31:52,841
Lucky.

1289
01:31:52,925 --> 01:31:54,259
Or just good aim.

1290
01:31:54,677 --> 01:31:55,969
You were awake when you fell.

1291
01:31:58,305 --> 01:32:00,099
- You saw?
- The whole thing.

1292
01:32:00,265 --> 01:32:01,934
Right through the ceiling.

1293
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:06,230
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

1294
01:32:06,313 --> 01:32:07,481
Here.

1295
01:32:08,816 --> 01:32:11,026
Didn't think those would
fit you until you shrunk down

1296
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:13,612
to a regular-size feller.

1297
01:32:15,906 --> 01:32:17,241
Thank you.

1298
01:32:17,991 --> 01:32:19,159
Are you an alien?

1299
01:32:19,785 --> 01:32:20,994
What?

1300
01:32:21,286 --> 01:32:22,663
From outer space, an alien.

1301
01:32:23,205 --> 01:32:24,248
No.

1302
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:27,793
Well, then, son, you've got a condition.

1303
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:40,973
Clint. You're going to be all right.

1304
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:46,645
You know that?

1305
01:32:47,438 --> 01:32:49,314
Is that what you know?

1306
01:32:51,775 --> 01:32:54,653
I've got no window.

1307
01:32:55,237 --> 01:32:56,655
I have to flush him out.

1308
01:32:57,698 --> 01:32:59,575
You got to level out.
It's going to take time.

1309
01:32:59,658 --> 01:33:01,076
You don't understand.

1310
01:33:03,162 --> 01:33:06,165
Have you ever had someone
take your brain and play?

1311
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:11,462
Pull you out
and stuff something else in?

1312
01:33:14,548 --> 01:33:16,717
Do you know what it's like
to be unmade?

1313
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:20,679
You know that I do.

1314
01:33:28,187 --> 01:33:29,229
Why am I back?

1315
01:33:30,647 --> 01:33:32,065
How did you get him out?

1316
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:34,860
Cognitive recalibration.

1317
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:37,654
I hit you really hard on the head.

1318
01:33:37,738 --> 01:33:38,864
Thanks.

1319
01:33:43,327 --> 01:33:44,870
Natasha...

1320
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:46,663
How many agents did I...

1321
01:33:46,747 --> 01:33:48,290
Don't.

1322
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:50,626
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

1323
01:33:51,335 --> 01:33:53,086
This is Loki.

1324
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:55,798
This is monsters and magic,

1325
01:33:55,881 --> 01:33:57,257
and nothing we were ever trained for.

1326
01:33:57,424 --> 01:33:58,967
Loki, did he get away?

1327
01:33:59,051 --> 01:34:00,052
Yeah.

1328
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:02,763
I don't suppose you know where.

1329
01:34:03,055 --> 01:34:04,890
I didn't need to know.

1330
01:34:04,973 --> 01:34:06,725
I didn't ask.

1331
01:34:09,978 --> 01:34:12,231
He's going to
make his play soon, though.

1332
01:34:12,606 --> 01:34:13,649
Today.

1333
01:34:13,899 --> 01:34:15,025
We got to stop him.

1334
01:34:15,651 --> 01:34:16,985
Yeah? Who's "we"?

1335
01:34:17,194 --> 01:34:19,029
I don't know. Whoever's left.

1336
01:34:20,531 --> 01:34:21,907
Well,

1337
01:34:23,575 --> 01:34:25,744
if I put an arrow
through Loki's eye socket,

1338
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:28,580
I would sleep better, I suppose.

1339
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,751
Now you sound like you.

1340
01:34:33,418 --> 01:34:34,920
But you don't.

1341
01:34:37,089 --> 01:34:39,967
You're a spy, not a soldier.

1342
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:44,805
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

1343
01:34:46,557 --> 01:34:48,559
What did Loki do to you?

1344
01:34:49,268 --> 01:34:51,728
He didn't. I just...

1345
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:56,984
Natasha.

1346
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:01,113
I've been compromised.

1347
01:35:04,116 --> 01:35:06,034
I got red in my ledger.

1348
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:10,497
I would like to wipe it out.

1349
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:28,056
Was he married?

1350
01:35:28,140 --> 01:35:29,558
No.

1351
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:33,937
There was a cellist, I think.

1352
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:36,940
I'm sorry.

1353
01:35:37,608 --> 01:35:39,026
He seemed like a good man.

1354
01:35:40,527 --> 01:35:41,695
He was an idiot.

1355
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,864
Why? For believing?

1356
01:35:44,156 --> 01:35:45,574
For taking on Loki alone.

1357
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:47,409
He was doing his job.

1358
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:49,828
He was out of his league.
He should have waited.

1359
01:35:49,912 --> 01:35:50,996
He should have...

1360
01:35:51,330 --> 01:35:52,831
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

1361
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:55,250
Right, I've heard that before.

1362
01:35:55,334 --> 01:35:56,501
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

1363
01:35:56,835 --> 01:35:58,462
We are not soldiers.

1364
01:36:03,175 --> 01:36:04,760
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

1365
01:36:05,052 --> 01:36:06,261
Neither am I.

1366
01:36:06,345 --> 01:36:08,597
He's got the same blood
on his hands that Loki does.

1367
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,098
But right now,
we got to put that behind us

1368
01:36:10,182 --> 01:36:12,184
and get this done.

1369
01:36:12,392 --> 01:36:13,393
Loki needs a power source.

1370
01:36:13,477 --> 01:36:14,436
If we can put together a list...

1371
01:36:14,519 --> 01:36:15,520
He made it personal.

1372
01:36:15,854 --> 01:36:16,855
That's not the point.

1373
01:36:17,022 --> 01:36:19,441
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

1374
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:21,318
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

1375
01:36:21,693 --> 01:36:22,736
To tear us apart.

1376
01:36:23,195 --> 01:36:24,696
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

1377
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:27,282
but he knows he has to
take us out to win, right?

1378
01:36:27,366 --> 01:36:28,951
That's what he wants.

1379
01:36:29,034 --> 01:36:31,286
He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

1380
01:36:31,453 --> 01:36:32,537
He wants an audience.

1381
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:35,207
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

1382
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:38,293
Yeah, that was just previews.
This is opening night.

1383
01:36:38,377 --> 01:36:40,963
And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

1384
01:36:41,046 --> 01:36:42,631
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

1385
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:46,218
He wants a monument built to the skies
with his name plastered...

1386
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:49,554
Son of a bitch.

1387
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:01,525
Time to go.

1388
01:37:01,984 --> 01:37:03,485
- Go where?
- I'll tell you on the way.

1389
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:04,695
Can you fly one of those jets?

1390
01:37:06,530 --> 01:37:07,531
I can.

1391
01:37:11,284 --> 01:37:12,411
You got a suit?

1392
01:37:12,619 --> 01:37:13,620
Yeah.

1393
01:37:13,912 --> 01:37:15,163
Then suit up.

1394
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:44,151
Hey, you guys aren't
authorised to be in here.

1395
01:37:44,276 --> 01:37:46,445
Son, just don't.

1396
01:37:48,947 --> 01:37:49,906
Sir.

1397
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:50,991
Agent Hill.

1398
01:37:51,742 --> 01:37:53,326
Those cards,

1399
01:37:55,454 --> 01:37:59,458
they were in Coulson's locker,
not in his jacket.

1400
01:38:03,962 --> 01:38:05,589
They needed the push.

1401
01:38:08,967 --> 01:38:11,136
<i>We have an unauthorised departure
from Bay 6.</i>

1402
01:38:11,887 --> 01:38:13,263
They found him.

1403
01:38:14,306 --> 01:38:18,060
Get our communications back up,
whatever you have to do.

1404
01:38:18,143 --> 01:38:20,270
- I want eyes on everything.
- Yes, sir.

1405
01:38:33,992 --> 01:38:35,744
<i>Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor</i>

1406
01:38:35,827 --> 01:38:39,706
<i>but the device
is already self-sustaining.</i>

1407
01:38:39,790 --> 01:38:42,000
<i>Shut it down, Dr Selvig.</i>

1408
01:38:42,292 --> 01:38:43,585
It's too late!

1409
01:38:45,712 --> 01:38:47,214
She can't stop now.

1410
01:38:48,507 --> 01:38:50,592
She wants to show us something!

1411
01:38:50,842 --> 01:38:52,969
A new universe.

1412
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:54,387
<i>Okay.</i>

1413
01:39:01,812 --> 01:39:03,772
<i>The barrier is pure energy.</i>

1414
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:05,482
<i>It's unbreachable.</i>

1415
01:39:05,816 --> 01:39:07,651
<i>Yeah, I got that.</i>

1416
01:39:08,527 --> 01:39:09,569
<i>Plan B.</i>

1417
01:39:10,987 --> 01:39:13,115
<i>Sir, the Mark 7
is not ready for deployment.</i>

1418
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:15,283
Then skip the spinning rims.
We're on the clock.

1419
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:37,931
Please tell me you're going
to appeal to my humanity.

1420
01:39:39,224 --> 01:39:41,518
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.

1421
01:39:41,685 --> 01:39:43,145
You should have left
your arm our on for that.

1422
01:39:43,436 --> 01:39:44,896
Yeah.

1423
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:46,148
It's seen a bit of mileage,

1424
01:39:46,231 --> 01:39:48,441
and you've got
the glow stick of destiny.

1425
01:39:49,609 --> 01:39:51,736
Would you like a drink?

1426
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:53,029
Stalling me won't change anything.

1427
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:55,490
No, no. Threatening.

1428
01:39:55,574 --> 01:39:56,658
No drink? Are you sure?

1429
01:39:57,075 --> 01:39:58,618
I'm having one.

1430
01:39:59,619 --> 01:40:03,582
The Chitauri are coming.
Nothing will change that.

1431
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:05,542
What have I to fear?

1432
01:40:05,959 --> 01:40:07,419
The Avengers.

1433
01:40:09,754 --> 01:40:12,132
That's what we call ourselves.
We're sort of like a team.

1434
01:40:12,215 --> 01:40:13,884
"Earth's mightiest heroes"-type thing.

1435
01:40:13,967 --> 01:40:15,552
Yes, I've met them.

1436
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:16,845
Yeah.

1437
01:40:17,137 --> 01:40:18,346
It takes us a while to get any traction,

1438
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:19,514
I'll give you that one.

1439
01:40:19,598 --> 01:40:21,808
But let's do a head count, here.

1440
01:40:21,892 --> 01:40:24,436
Your brother, the demigod,

1441
01:40:26,104 --> 01:40:29,524
a super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend.

1442
01:40:29,816 --> 01:40:33,028
A man with breathtaking
anger-management issues,

1443
01:40:33,111 --> 01:40:36,031
a couple of master assassins,
and you, big fella,

1444
01:40:36,823 --> 01:40:39,492
you've managed to piss off
every single one of them.

1445
01:40:39,576 --> 01:40:40,619
That was the plan.

1446
01:40:41,036 --> 01:40:43,079
Not a great plan.

1447
01:40:43,163 --> 01:40:45,248
When they come,

1448
01:40:45,332 --> 01:40:46,833
and they will,

1449
01:40:46,917 --> 01:40:48,043
they'll come for you.

1450
01:40:48,126 --> 01:40:49,169
I have an army.

1451
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:50,337
We have a Hulk.

1452
01:40:51,087 --> 01:40:52,505
I thought the beast had wandered off.

1453
01:40:52,589 --> 01:40:54,549
You're missing the point.
There is no throne.

1454
01:40:54,633 --> 01:40:58,428
There is no version of this
where you come out on top.

1455
01:40:58,803 --> 01:41:00,764
Maybe your army comes
and maybe it's too much for us,

1456
01:41:00,972 --> 01:41:02,974
but it's all on you.

1457
01:41:04,017 --> 01:41:05,143
Because if we can't protect the Earth,

1458
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:08,230
you can be damn well sure
we'll avenge it.

1459
01:41:10,482 --> 01:41:13,526
How will your friends have time for me

1460
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:15,195
when they are so busy fighting you?

1461
01:41:22,619 --> 01:41:23,662
This usually works.

1462
01:41:23,787 --> 01:41:26,623
Well, performance issues,
it's not uncommon.

1463
01:41:26,957 --> 01:41:28,625
One out of five...

1464
01:41:30,335 --> 01:41:33,338
Jarvis, anytime now.

1465
01:41:35,006 --> 01:41:37,801
You will all fall before me.

1466
01:41:37,884 --> 01:41:39,135
Deploy!

1467
01:41:39,386 --> 01:41:40,512
Deploy!

1468
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:11,042
<i>And there's one other
person you pissed off</i>

1469
01:42:11,876 --> 01:42:13,211
<i>His name was Phil.</i>

1470
01:42:37,110 --> 01:42:38,653
Right.

1471
01:42:38,737 --> 01:42:39,738
Army.

1472
01:43:52,352 --> 01:43:53,728
Loki!

1473
01:43:53,812 --> 01:43:55,563
Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it.

1474
01:43:55,647 --> 01:43:56,773
You can't.

1475
01:43:56,898 --> 01:43:58,817
There is no stopping it.

1476
01:43:59,109 --> 01:44:00,652
There is only

1477
01:44:00,819 --> 01:44:01,986
the war.

1478
01:44:02,153 --> 01:44:03,279
So be it.

1479
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:26,928
<i>Stark, we're on your three,
headed northeast.</i>

1480
01:44:27,178 --> 01:44:29,180
What? Did you stop for drive-through?

1481
01:44:29,264 --> 01:44:31,015
Swing up Park. I'm going
to lay them out for you.

1482
01:44:49,409 --> 01:44:50,785
<i>Sir, we have more incoming.</i>

1483
01:44:50,869 --> 01:44:52,370
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

1484
01:44:59,502 --> 01:45:01,045
- Nat?
- I see him.

1485
01:45:45,757 --> 01:45:47,967
We got to get back up there.

1486
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:40,728
Stark, are you seeing this?

1487
01:46:41,688 --> 01:46:43,856
<i>Seeing. Still working on believing.</i>

1488
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:45,525
Where's Banner?
Has he shown up yet?

1489
01:46:45,650 --> 01:46:46,734
<i>Banner?</i>

1490
01:46:46,818 --> 01:46:47,819
Just keep me posted.

1491
01:46:48,361 --> 01:46:50,572
<i>Jarvis, find me a soft spot.</i>

1492
01:46:53,157 --> 01:46:54,742
Look at this!

1493
01:46:54,826 --> 01:46:55,827
Look around you!

1494
01:46:57,161 --> 01:47:00,665
You think this madness
will end with your rule?

1495
01:47:01,165 --> 01:47:02,667
It's too late.

1496
01:47:04,168 --> 01:47:05,420
It's too late to stop it.

1497
01:47:05,503 --> 01:47:09,048
No. We can, together.

1498
01:47:16,014 --> 01:47:17,765
Sentiment.

1499
01:47:46,002 --> 01:47:48,254
We've got civilians
still trapped up here.

1500
01:47:49,255 --> 01:47:50,256
Loki.

1501
01:48:01,851 --> 01:48:03,645
They're fish in a barrel down there.

1502
01:48:09,275 --> 01:48:11,277
We got this. It's good. Go.

1503
01:48:11,361 --> 01:48:12,570
Do you think you can hold them off?

1504
01:48:12,654 --> 01:48:13,696
Captain,

1505
01:48:15,865 --> 01:48:18,534
it would be my genuine pleasure.

1506
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:47,021
Just like Budapest all over again.

1507
01:48:47,897 --> 01:48:50,108
You and I remember Budapest
very differently.

1508
01:49:06,582 --> 01:49:07,583
It's going to be an hour

1509
01:49:07,667 --> 01:49:09,043
before they can
scramble the National Guard.

1510
01:49:09,127 --> 01:49:10,962
National Guard?

1511
01:49:11,838 --> 01:49:13,172
Does the army know
what's happening here?

1512
01:49:13,256 --> 01:49:14,257
Do we?

1513
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:17,051
You need men in these buildings.

1514
01:49:17,135 --> 01:49:18,678
There are people inside and
they're going to be running

1515
01:49:18,761 --> 01:49:20,012
right into the line of fire.

1516
01:49:20,138 --> 01:49:22,056
You take them to the basements
or through the subway.

1517
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:23,766
You keep them off the streets.

1518
01:49:23,850 --> 01:49:26,144
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

1519
01:49:26,602 --> 01:49:27,979
Why the hell
should I take orders from you?

1520
01:49:42,326 --> 01:49:43,536
I need men in those buildings.

1521
01:49:43,619 --> 01:49:45,747
Lead the people down
and away from the streets.

1522
01:49:45,830 --> 01:49:48,166
We're going to set up a perimeter
all the way down to 39th Street.

1523
01:49:58,801 --> 01:50:00,178
Well, we got its attention.

1524
01:50:00,511 --> 01:50:02,430
<i>What the hell was step two?</i>

1525
01:50:31,918 --> 01:50:32,960
What's the story upstairs?

1526
01:50:33,044 --> 01:50:35,004
The power surrounding the Cube
is impenetrable.

1527
01:50:35,087 --> 01:50:37,757
<i>Thor's right. We got
to deal with these guys.</i>

1528
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,509
- How do we do this?
- As a team.

1529
01:50:39,592 --> 01:50:40,718
I have unfinished business with Loki.

1530
01:50:41,135 --> 01:50:42,178
Yeah? Well, get in line.

1531
01:50:42,261 --> 01:50:43,262
Save it.

1532
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:45,139
Loki's going to keep
this fight focused on us,

1533
01:50:45,223 --> 01:50:46,265
and that's what we need.

1534
01:50:46,349 --> 01:50:48,059
Without him,
these things could run wild.

1535
01:50:48,142 --> 01:50:50,728
We got Stark up top.
He's going to need us to...

1536
01:50:58,444 --> 01:51:02,031
So, this all seems horrible.

1537
01:51:02,532 --> 01:51:03,658
I've seen worse.

1538
01:51:04,075 --> 01:51:05,159
Sorry.

1539
01:51:05,368 --> 01:51:07,870
No, we could use a little worse.

1540
01:51:08,287 --> 01:51:10,414
- Stark, we got him.
- <i>Banner?</i>

1541
01:51:10,623 --> 01:51:11,916
Just like you said.

1542
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:14,836
Then tell him to suit up.
I'm bringing the party to you.

1543
01:51:21,425 --> 01:51:23,177
I don't see how that's a party.

1544
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:32,061
Dr Banner.

1545
01:51:33,896 --> 01:51:35,731
Now might be a really good
time for you to get angry.

1546
01:51:36,566 --> 01:51:39,110
That's my secret, Captain.

1547
01:51:40,778 --> 01:51:42,113
I'm always angry.

1548
01:51:53,791 --> 01:51:55,209
<i>Hold on!</i>

1549
01:52:25,323 --> 01:52:26,699
Send the rest.

1550
01:52:33,456 --> 01:52:34,749
Guys.

1551
01:52:34,999 --> 01:52:36,250
<i>Call it, Captain.</i>

1552
01:52:36,334 --> 01:52:37,585
All right, listen up.

1553
01:52:37,668 --> 01:52:40,171
Until we can close that portal,
our priority is containment.

1554
01:52:40,546 --> 01:52:41,923
Barton, I want you on that roof.

1555
01:52:42,006 --> 01:52:43,925
Eyes on everything.
Call out patterns and strays.

1556
01:52:44,008 --> 01:52:45,092
Stark, you got the perimeter.

1557
01:52:45,176 --> 01:52:46,427
Anything gets
more than three blocks out,

1558
01:52:46,552 --> 01:52:48,179
you turn it back or you turn it to ash.

1559
01:52:48,512 --> 01:52:49,555
- Can you give me a lift?
- <i>Right.</i>

1560
01:52:49,639 --> 01:52:50,765
<i>Better clench up, Legolas.</i>

1561
01:52:54,518 --> 01:52:56,520
Thor, you got to try
and bottleneck that portal.

1562
01:52:56,854 --> 01:52:57,980
Slow them down.

1563
01:52:58,272 --> 01:53:00,149
You got the lightning.
Light the bastards up.

1564
01:53:02,735 --> 01:53:04,028
You and me,
we stay here on the ground.

1565
01:53:04,111 --> 01:53:05,279
We keep the fighting here.

1566
01:53:05,363 --> 01:53:06,364
And Hulk...

1567
01:53:09,033 --> 01:53:10,159
Smash.

1568
01:54:04,088 --> 01:54:05,214
Sir.

1569
01:54:05,965 --> 01:54:06,966
The Council is on.

1570
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:15,141
Stark, you got a lot of strays
sniffing your tail.

1571
01:54:17,184 --> 01:54:19,061
I'm just trying to keep them
off the streets.

1572
01:54:19,353 --> 01:54:21,313
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

1573
01:54:21,397 --> 01:54:22,606
So find a tight corner.

1574
01:54:22,815 --> 01:54:24,233
I will roger that.

1575
01:54:47,089 --> 01:54:48,299
Oh, boy.

1576
01:54:55,514 --> 01:54:57,183
Nice call.

1577
01:54:57,266 --> 01:54:58,517
What else you got?

1578
01:54:58,601 --> 01:55:01,437
<i>Thor is taking on
a squadron down on Sixth.</i>

1579
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:03,481
And he didn't invite me.

1580
01:55:43,229 --> 01:55:45,231
Captain, none of this
is going to mean a damn thing

1581
01:55:45,314 --> 01:55:46,273
if we don't close that portal.

1582
01:55:46,357 --> 01:55:47,608
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

1583
01:55:47,983 --> 01:55:50,277
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

1584
01:55:52,321 --> 01:55:54,073
If you want to get up there,
you're going to need a ride.

1585
01:55:55,116 --> 01:55:56,242
I got a ride.

1586
01:55:57,326 --> 01:55:58,369
I could use a boost, though.

1587
01:56:01,038 --> 01:56:02,039
Are you sure about this?

1588
01:56:02,706 --> 01:56:05,042
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1589
01:56:32,236 --> 01:56:34,029
Okay, turn, turn.

1590
01:56:34,238 --> 01:56:36,031
Less! Less!

1591
01:57:58,656 --> 01:58:01,659
<i>Captain, the bank
on 42nd past Madison.</i>

1592
01:58:01,742 --> 01:58:03,577
<i>They've cornered
a lot of civilians in there.</i>

1593
01:58:03,661 --> 01:58:05,412
I'm on it.

1594
01:58:25,683 --> 01:58:27,351
Everyone! Clear out!

1595
01:58:57,381 --> 01:58:59,091
<i>Director Fury,</i>

1596
01:58:59,174 --> 01:59:00,718
<i>the Council has made a decision.</i>

1597
01:59:01,051 --> 01:59:03,846
I recognise the Council
has made a decision.

1598
01:59:03,929 --> 01:59:05,597
But given that
it's a stupid-ass decision,

1599
01:59:05,681 --> 01:59:07,141
I have elected to ignore it.

1600
01:59:07,224 --> 01:59:10,311
<i>Director, you're closer
than any of our subs.</i>

1601
01:59:10,394 --> 01:59:11,437
<i>You scramble that jet...</i>

1602
01:59:11,562 --> 01:59:14,356
That is the island of Manhattan,
Councilman.

1603
01:59:14,606 --> 01:59:16,775
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

1604
01:59:16,859 --> 01:59:18,861
I will not order a nuclear strike

1605
01:59:18,944 --> 01:59:20,279
against a civilian population.

1606
01:59:20,529 --> 01:59:22,740
<i>If we don't hold them here,
we lose everything.</i>

1607
01:59:23,073 --> 01:59:25,826
If I send that bird out, we already have.

1608
01:59:29,580 --> 01:59:30,914
You.

1609
01:59:33,542 --> 01:59:34,752
Hawkeye!

1610
01:59:35,836 --> 01:59:36,837
Nat, what are you doing?

1611
01:59:37,796 --> 01:59:38,797
A little help?

1612
01:59:44,219 --> 01:59:45,220
I got him.

1613
02:00:11,663 --> 02:00:12,664
Enough!

1614
02:00:13,290 --> 02:00:15,501
You are, all of you, beneath me!

1615
02:00:15,834 --> 02:00:18,670
I am a god, you dull creature.

1616
02:00:18,754 --> 02:00:20,297
And I will not be bullied by...

1617
02:00:29,807 --> 02:00:31,725
Puny god.

1618
02:00:40,067 --> 02:00:41,610
The sceptre...

1619
02:00:42,694 --> 02:00:43,987
Doctor.

1620
02:00:45,823 --> 02:00:48,700
Loki's sceptre. The energy.

1621
02:00:48,784 --> 02:00:50,452
The Tesseract can't fight,

1622
02:00:50,536 --> 02:00:52,371
but you can't protect against yourself.

1623
02:00:52,538 --> 02:00:53,580
It's not your fault.

1624
02:00:53,664 --> 02:00:54,748
You didn't know what you were doing.

1625
02:00:58,168 --> 02:01:00,379
Actually, I think I did.

1626
02:01:00,462 --> 02:01:03,465
I built in a safety
to cut their power source.

1627
02:01:04,591 --> 02:01:06,093
Loki's sceptre.

1628
02:01:06,176 --> 02:01:08,804
It may be able to close the portal.

1629
02:01:10,848 --> 02:01:12,683
And I'm looking right at it.

1630
02:01:25,154 --> 02:01:28,657
<i>Sir, we will lose power
before we penetrate that shell.</i>

1631
02:01:35,456 --> 02:01:38,792
Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

1632
02:01:38,876 --> 02:01:41,044
<i>I wouldn't consider him a role model.</i>

1633
02:02:50,864 --> 02:02:52,699
<i>Director Fury is no longer in command.</i>

1634
02:02:52,783 --> 02:02:54,868
<i>Override order 7-Alpha-1-1.</i>

1635
02:02:54,952 --> 02:02:57,412
<i>7-Alpha-1-1, confirmed.
We're go for take off</i>

1636
02:02:58,455 --> 02:03:00,457
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

1637
02:03:00,999 --> 02:03:02,793
Anyone on the deck,
we have a rogue bird.

1638
02:03:03,126 --> 02:03:04,461
We need to shut it down!

1639
02:03:04,545 --> 02:03:06,547
Repeat, takeoff is not authorised.

1640
02:03:37,327 --> 02:03:39,538
Stark, do you hear me?

1641
02:03:39,621 --> 02:03:41,582
You have a missile
headed straight for the city.

1642
02:03:42,291 --> 02:03:43,709
<i>How long?</i>

1643
02:03:43,792 --> 02:03:45,919
<i>Three minutes, max.</i>

1644
02:03:46,003 --> 02:03:47,462
<i>The payload
will wipe out Midtown.</i>

1645
02:03:47,713 --> 02:03:49,590
Jarvis, put everything we got
into the thrusters.

1646
02:03:49,881 --> 02:03:51,592
<i>I just did.</i>

1647
02:04:04,313 --> 02:04:05,689
<i>Package is sent.</i>

1648
02:04:05,897 --> 02:04:08,859
<i>Detonation in
2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.</i>

1649
02:04:31,798 --> 02:04:34,217
Are you ready for another bout?

1650
02:04:34,676 --> 02:04:35,719
What, are you getting sleepy?

1651
02:04:41,475 --> 02:04:43,268
Right at the crown!

1652
02:04:49,232 --> 02:04:51,109
I can close it.

1653
02:04:51,193 --> 02:04:52,903
Can anybody copy?

1654
02:04:53,028 --> 02:04:54,237
I can shut the portal down.

1655
02:04:54,571 --> 02:04:56,531
- Do it!
- <i>No, wait.</i>

1656
02:04:56,615 --> 02:04:57,824
Stark, these things are still coming.

1657
02:04:57,908 --> 02:04:58,909
I got a nuke coming in.

1658
02:04:58,992 --> 02:05:00,869
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

1659
02:05:10,837 --> 02:05:12,506
And I know just where to put it.

1660
02:05:19,888 --> 02:05:22,265
<i>Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.</i>

1661
02:05:22,349 --> 02:05:23,767
Save the rest for the turn, J.

1662
02:05:23,850 --> 02:05:28,021
<i>Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?</i>

1663
02:05:28,105 --> 02:05:29,856
Might as well.

1664
02:05:32,067 --> 02:05:34,486
<i>The streets of New York City
have become a battleground.</i>

1665
02:05:34,569 --> 02:05:36,947
<i>The Army is here trying
to contain the violence</i>

1666
02:05:37,155 --> 02:05:38,699
<i>but clearly, it is outmatched.</i>

1667
02:05:38,949 --> 02:05:41,284
<i>And I have to say,
in all my years of reporting,</i>

1668
02:05:41,368 --> 02:05:44,121
<i>I have never seen anything like this.</i>

1669
02:05:44,454 --> 02:05:45,789
<i>We have limited information
on the team</i>

1670
02:05:46,039 --> 02:05:49,626
<i>but we do know that
billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...</i>

1671
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:05,035
Come on, Stark.

1672
02:07:11,416 --> 02:07:12,584
Close it.

1673
02:07:32,687 --> 02:07:33,688
Son of a gun.

1674
02:07:38,568 --> 02:07:40,237
He's not slowing down.

1675
02:07:58,255 --> 02:07:59,548
Is he breathing?

1676
02:08:27,617 --> 02:08:28,827
What the hell?

1677
02:08:31,746 --> 02:08:33,915
What just happened?

1678
02:08:34,165 --> 02:08:36,293
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

1679
02:08:40,547 --> 02:08:42,007
We won.

1680
02:08:44,551 --> 02:08:45,886
All right, yay!

1681
02:08:45,969 --> 02:08:48,013
Hurray. Good job, guys.

1682
02:08:48,096 --> 02:08:51,057
Let's just not come in tomorrow.
Let's just take a day.

1683
02:08:52,058 --> 02:08:53,476
Have you ever tried shawarma?

1684
02:08:54,144 --> 02:08:56,271
There's a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here.

1685
02:08:56,354 --> 02:08:58,106
I don't know what it is,
but I want to try it.

1686
02:08:58,648 --> 02:08:59,983
We're not finished yet.

1687
02:09:05,071 --> 02:09:06,990
And then shawarma after.

1688
02:09:28,845 --> 02:09:31,181
If it's all the same to you,

1689
02:09:34,392 --> 02:09:36,102
I'll have that drink now.

1690
02:09:43,985 --> 02:09:46,029
<i>Despite the devastation
of what has been confirmed</i>

1691
02:09:46,112 --> 02:09:47,906
<i>as an extraterrestrial attack,</i>

1692
02:09:47,989 --> 02:09:49,532
<i>the extraordinary heroics</i>

1693
02:09:49,658 --> 02:09:51,618
<i>of the group known as the Avengers</i>

1694
02:09:51,701 --> 02:09:53,286
<i>has been to many a cause
not only for comfort,</i>

1695
02:09:53,370 --> 02:09:54,371
<i>but for celebration.</i>

1696
02:09:54,496 --> 02:09:56,957
<i>It's just really great knowing
they're out there.</i>

1697
02:09:57,040 --> 02:09:58,917
<i>That someone is watching over us.</i>

1698
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,251
<i>I love you, Thor!</i>

1699
02:10:00,335 --> 02:10:02,087
<i>And then these guys were like...</i>

1700
02:10:02,170 --> 02:10:03,505
<i>And then the air goes...</i>

1701
02:10:03,588 --> 02:10:05,006
<i>And this green guy walks up
and he goes...</i>

1702
02:10:05,090 --> 02:10:06,174
<i>I don't know.</i>

1703
02:10:06,257 --> 02:10:08,802
<i>I don't exactly feel safer
with those things out there.</i>

1704
02:10:08,885 --> 02:10:11,972
<i>It just seems that there's
a lot they're not telling us.</i>

1705
02:10:12,055 --> 02:10:15,308
<i>Superheroes in New York?
Give me a break.</i>

1706
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:17,560
<i>These so-called "heroes"</i>

1707
02:10:17,644 --> 02:10:18,979
<i>have to be held responsible</i>

1708
02:10:19,062 --> 02:10:21,314
<i>for the destruction done to this city.</i>

1709
02:10:21,398 --> 02:10:23,525
<i>This was their fight.
Where are they now?</i>

1710
02:10:23,608 --> 02:10:26,486
<i>Tough questions are being asked
about the Avengers themselves.</i>

1711
02:10:26,569 --> 02:10:27,654
<i>Their sudden appearance</i>

1712
02:10:27,737 --> 02:10:29,155
<i>and equally sudden disappearance...</i>

1713
02:10:29,239 --> 02:10:32,075
<i>What, this is all somehow their fault?</i>

1714
02:10:34,077 --> 02:10:37,247
<i>Captain America saved my life.</i>

1715
02:10:39,374 --> 02:10:42,877
<i>Wherever he is, and
wherever any of them are,</i>

1716
02:10:42,961 --> 02:10:44,504
<i>I would just...</i>

1717
02:10:45,255 --> 02:10:47,590
<i>I would want to say thank you.</i>

1718
02:10:50,051 --> 02:10:51,594
<i>Where are the Avengers?</i>

1719
02:10:51,928 --> 02:10:54,097
I'm not currently
tracking their whereabouts.

1720
02:10:54,180 --> 02:10:56,391
I'd say they've earned
a leave of absence.

1721
02:10:56,474 --> 02:10:58,101
<i>And the Tesseract?</i>

1722
02:10:58,184 --> 02:11:00,270
<i>The Tesseract is where it belongs.</i>

1723
02:11:00,895 --> 02:11:03,273
<i>Out of our reach.</i>

1724
02:11:03,481 --> 02:11:04,899
<i>That's not your call.</i>

1725
02:11:04,983 --> 02:11:06,026
I didn't make it.

1726
02:11:06,151 --> 02:11:08,236
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

1727
02:11:08,528 --> 02:11:10,196
<i>So, you let him take it</i>

1728
02:11:10,447 --> 02:11:12,115
<i>and the war criminal, Loki,</i>

1729
02:11:12,198 --> 02:11:13,992
<i>who should be
answering for his crime.</i>

1730
02:11:14,075 --> 02:11:16,411
<i>I think he will be.</i>

1731
02:11:30,133 --> 02:11:32,510
<i>I don't think you understand
what you've started,</i>

1732
02:11:32,886 --> 02:11:35,180
<i>letting the Avengers
loose on this world.</i>

1733
02:11:35,597 --> 02:11:36,639
<i>They're dangerous.</i>

1734
02:11:37,015 --> 02:11:40,518
<i>They surely are,
and the whole world knows it.</i>

1735
02:11:41,227 --> 02:11:43,563
Every world knows it.

1736
02:11:44,230 --> 02:11:46,191
<i>Was that the point of all this?</i>

1737
02:11:46,483 --> 02:11:48,026
<i>A statement?</i>

1738
02:11:50,904 --> 02:11:52,405
<i>A promise.</i>

1739
02:12:00,872 --> 02:12:02,457
<i>Sir, how does it work now?</i>

1740
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:05,794
They've gone their separate ways.

1741
02:12:05,877 --> 02:12:08,838
Some, pretty extremely far.

1742
02:12:09,547 --> 02:12:11,549
If we get into a situation like this again,

1743
02:12:11,633 --> 02:12:12,967
what happens then?

1744
02:12:13,051 --> 02:12:14,094
They'll come back.

1745
02:12:15,762 --> 02:12:17,263
Are you really sure about that?

1746
02:12:17,347 --> 02:12:18,348
I am.

1747
02:12:20,225 --> 02:12:21,518
Why?

1748
02:12:22,519 --> 02:12:24,395
Because we'll need them to.

1749
02:15:16,276 --> 02:15:18,820
Humans.

1750
02:15:20,029 --> 02:15:24,450
They are not the cowering
wretches we were promised.

1751
02:15:25,368 --> 02:15:27,537
They stand.

1752
02:15:28,371 --> 02:15:33,584
They are unruly,
and therefore cannot be ruled.

1753
02:15:41,801 --> 02:15:44,721
To challenge them

1754
02:15:44,804 --> 02:15:48,182
is to court death.
