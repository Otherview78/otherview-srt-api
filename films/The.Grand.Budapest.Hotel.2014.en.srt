1
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:58,912
It is an extremely common mistake:

2
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,499
people think the writer's imagination
is always at work,

3
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:05,335
that he's constantly inventing
an endless supply

4
00:02:05,418 --> 00:02:07,378
of incidents and episodes,

5
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:11,299
that he simply dreams up his stories
out of thin air.

6
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:14,135
In point of fact, the opposite is true.

7
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:16,429
Once the public knows you're a writer,

8
00:02:16,513 --> 00:02:19,307
they bring the characters
and events to you,

9
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,559
and as long as you maintain
your ability to look -

10
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:24,020
...and to carefully listen,

11
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:27,524
these stories will continue to -

12
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:30,193
Stop it. Stop it! Don't! Don't do it!

13
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:39,327
...uh, will continue to seek you out,
uh, over your lifetime.

14
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:43,540
To him who has often
told the tales of others,

15
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:45,291
many tales will be told.

16
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,793
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

17
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:50,588
The incidents that follow
were described to me

18
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:53,299
exactly as I present them here

19
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:56,302
and in a wholly unexpected way.

20
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:05,186
<i>A number of years ago,</i>

21
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,273
<i>while suffering from a mild case
of "scribe's fever, "</i>

22
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:12,193
<i>a form of neurasthenia common
among the intelligentsia of that time,</i>

23
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:14,279
<i>I decided to spend the month of August</i>

24
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:18,408
<i>in the spa town of Nebelsbad
below the Alpine Sudetenwaltz,</i>

25
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:21,744
<i>and had taken up rooms
in the Grand Budapest,</i>

26
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:26,958
<i>a picturesque, elaborate
and once widely celebrated establishment.</i>

27
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,960
<i>I expect some of you will know it.</i>

28
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:34,632
<i>It was off-season and,
by that time, decidedly out of fashion,</i>

29
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:39,178
<i>and it had already begun its descent
into shabbiness and eventual demolition.</i>

30
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:43,016
<i>What few guests we were</i>

31
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:45,560
<i>had quickly come
to recognize one another by sight</i>

32
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:49,022
<i>as the only living souls residing
in the vast establishment,</i>

33
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:52,859
<i>although I do not believe any acquaintance
among our number had proceeded</i>

34
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:57,030
<i>beyond the polite nods we exchanged
as we passed in the Palm Court,</i>

35
00:03:57,113 --> 00:04:00,575
<i>in the Arabian baths
and onboard the Colonnade Funicular.</i>

36
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:04,537
<i>We were a very reserved group, it seemed,</i>

37
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:08,249
<i>and, without exception... solitary.</i>

38
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:14,547
<i>Perhaps as a result
of this general silence,</i>

39
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:18,635
<i>I had established a casual and bantering
familiarity with the hotel's concierge,</i>

40
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:21,971
<i>a West-continental
known only as Monsieur Jean,</i>

41
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:25,266
<i>who struck one as being, at once,
both lazy and,</i>

42
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,101
<i>really, quite accommodating.</i>

43
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:29,520
<i>I expect he was not well paid.</i>

44
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:33,107
<i>In any case, one evening,
as I stood conferring elbow to elbow</i>

45
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:35,318
<i>with Monsieur Jean,
as had become my habit,</i>

46
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,946
<i>I noticed a new presence in our company.</i>

47
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:41,157
<i>A small, elderly man, smartly dressed,</i>

48
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,202
<i>with an exceptionally lively,
intelligent face</i>

49
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:47,288
<i>and an immediately perceptible
air of sadness.</i>

50
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,875
<i>He was, like the rest of us, alone,
but also, I must say,</i>

51
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,630
<i>he was the first that struck one as being
deeply and truly lonely.</i>

52
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:58,508
<i>A symptom of my own
medical condition as well.</i>

53
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:02,387
- Who's this interesting old fellow?
<i>- I inquired of Monsieur Jean.</i>

54
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:05,348
<i>To my surprise,
he was distinctly taken aback.</i>

55
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:06,891
- Don't you know?
<i>- He asked.</i>

56
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:10,228
- Don't you recognize him?
<i>- He did look familiar.</i>

57
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:14,023
That's Mr. Moustafa himself.
He arrived earlier this morning.

58
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:19,278
<i>This name will no doubt be familiar
to the more seasoned persons among you.</i>

59
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:26,119
<i>Mr. Zero Moustafa was at one time
the richest man in Zubrowka...</i>

60
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:31,207
<i>and was still indeed
the owner of the Grand Budapest.</i>

61
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,669
He often comes and stays a week or more,

62
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:37,171
three times a year at least,
but never in the season.

63
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:39,716
<i>Monsieur Jean signaled to me
and I leaned closer.</i>

64
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:40,967
I'll tell you a secret.

65
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,430
He takes a single-bed room without a bath
in the rear corner of the top floor,

66
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,598
and it's smaller
than the service elevator.

67
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:48,933
<i>It was well known,</i>

68
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:51,894
<i>Zero Moustafa had purchased
and famously inhabited</i>

69
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:54,897
<i>some of the most lavish castles
and palazzos on the continent,</i>

70
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:58,317
<i>yet here, in his own nearly empty hotel,</i>

71
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:00,820
<i>he occupied a servant's quarters?</i>

72
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,033
<i>At that moment, the curtain rose
on a parenthetical, domestic drama -</i>

73
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:06,200
Shit.

74
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:09,662
<i>... which required the immediate
and complete attention of Monsieur Jean -</i>

75
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:15,376
<i>...but, frankly,
did not hold mine for long.</i>

76
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:27,180
<i>However, this premature intermission
in the story of the curious old man,</i>

77
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:31,434
<i>had left me, as the expression goes,</i>
"gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen "-

78
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:34,145
<i>That is, on the edge of my seat,</i>

79
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:37,315
<i>where I remained throughout
the next morning until -</i>

80
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:40,985
<i>in what I have found to be its mysterious
and utterly reliable fashion -</i>

81
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:45,156
<i>fate, once again, intervened on my behalf.</i>

82
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,162
I admire your work.

83
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:55,625
I beg your pardon?

84
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,506
I said, I know and admire
your wonderful work.

85
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:04,300
Thank you most kindly, sir.

86
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:06,969
Did Monsieur Jean have a word or two
to share with you

87
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:10,556
about the aged proprietor
of this establishment?

88
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:15,269
I must confess,
I did myself inquire about you.

89
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:18,272
He's perfectly capable,
of course, Monsieur Jean,

90
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:20,233
but we can't claim he's a first -

91
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:23,069
or, in earnest,
even second-rate concierge.

92
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:24,237
But there it is.

93
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,948
Times have changed.

94
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:32,662
The thermal baths are very beautiful.

95
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:36,624
They were in their first condition.
It couldn't be maintained, of course.

96
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,584
Too decadent for current tastes.

97
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:43,464
But I love it all just the same,
this enchanting old ruin.

98
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:48,928
How did you come to buy it, if I may ask?
The Grand Budapest.

99
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:00,064
I didn't.

100
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:14,704
If you're not merely being polite -
and you must tell me if that's the case -

101
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:17,206
but if it genuinely does interest you,

102
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:20,293
may I invite you to dine with me tonight,

103
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:24,213
and it will be my pleasure and, indeed,
my privilege to tell you

104
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:27,925
my story... such as it is.

105
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,017
Two ducks roasted with olives.

106
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:38,603
- Rabbit, salad?
- Hmm.

107
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:41,522
Pouilly-Jouvet '52,
plus a split of the Brut.

108
00:08:42,982 --> 00:08:47,320
That should provide us ample time...
if I commence promptly.

109
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:48,613
By all means.

110
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:13,095
Well, it begins, as it must,
with our mutual friend's predecessor.

111
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:17,225
The beloved,
original concierge of The Grand Budapest.

112
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,603
It begins, of course, with...

113
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:45,294
- Bring the table to the window.
- Yes, Monsieur Gustave.

114
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:47,755
- Bring the tray to the table.
- Right away, Monsieur Gustave.

115
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:50,508
Right there.
Have those been brushed and blocked?

116
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,593
- Of course, Monsieur Gustave.
- Pack them in the hat boxes.

117
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:54,762
- Is that from Oberstdorf & Company?
- I believe so.

118
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,639
- Second trunk. Who has the tickets?
- I do.

119
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:57,765
Give them to me.

120
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,435
These are in order. Wait in the corner.

121
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:12,613
- I'm not leaving.
- I beg your pardon?

122
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:14,824
- I'm not leaving.
- Why not?

123
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:17,076
- I'm frightened.
- Of what?

124
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,453
I fear this may be the last time
we ever see each other.

125
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:20,830
Why on earth would that be the case?

126
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:23,249
Well, I can't put it into words,
but I feel it.

127
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:26,002
For goodness sake, there's no reason
for you to leave us if you'd rather -

128
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:29,463
- Come with me.
- To fucking Lutz?

129
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:31,507
- Please.
- Give me your hand.

130
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:36,804
You've nothing to fear.
You're always anxious before you travel.

131
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:39,932
I admit, you appear to be suffering
a more acute attack on this occasion,

132
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:42,810
but, truly and honestly - Dear God.
What have you done to your fingernails?

133
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,562
- I beg your pardon?
- This diabolical varnish.

134
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,772
- The color is completely wrong.
- Don't you like it?

135
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:49,734
It's not that I don't like it.
I am physically repulsed.

136
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:53,988
- Perhaps this will soothe you.
- What? Don't recite.

137
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:56,407
- Just listen to the words. Hush.
- Please. Not now.

138
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:00,828
"While questing once
in noble wood of gray, medieval pine,

139
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:05,166
I came upon a tomb,
rain-slick'd, rubbed-cool, ethereal;

140
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,168
its inscription long-vanished,

141
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,587
yet still within
its melancholy fissures..."

142
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:12,214
Will you light a candle for me, please?

143
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:17,094
- In the sacristy of Santa Maria?
- I'll see to it myself immediately.

144
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:21,223
Remember, I'm always with you.

145
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:25,144
- I love you.
- I love you.

146
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,312
<i>Abfahren!</i>

147
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:39,241
It's quite a thing winning the loyalty
of a woman like that

148
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:41,327
for 19 consecutive seasons.

149
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:45,331
- Uh, yes, sir.
- She's very fond of me, you know?

150
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:46,457
Yes, sir.

151
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,919
- But I've never seen her like that before.
- No, sir.

152
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:52,338
She was shaking like a shitting dog.

153
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:54,715
Truly.

154
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,927
Run to the cathedral of Santa Maria
in Brucknerplatz.

155
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,097
Buy one of the plain, half-length candles
and take back four Klubecks in change.

156
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,015
Light it in the sacristy,
say a brief rosary,

157
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:05,267
then go to Mendl's and get me
a courtesan <i>au chocolat.</i>

158
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:07,812
If there's any money left,
give it to the crippled shoeshine boy.

159
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:11,774
- Right away, sir.
- Hold it.

160
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:17,863
- Who are you?
- I'm Zero, sir. The new lobby boy.

161
00:12:17,947 --> 00:12:19,323
- Zero, you say?
- Yes, sir.

162
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:21,700
I've never heard of you,
never laid eyes on you. Who hired you?

163
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:24,412
- Mr. Mosher, sir.
- Mr. Mosher!

164
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:26,872
Yes, Monsieur Gustave?

165
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:29,542
Am I to understand you've surreptitiously
hired this young man

166
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,876
in the position of a lobby boy?

167
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:34,630
He's been engaged for a trial period,
pending your approval, of course.

168
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,132
Oh...

169
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:38,509
Perhaps, yes. Thank you, Mr. Mosher.

170
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,428
You're most welcome, Monsieur Gustave.

171
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:44,098
You're now going to be
officially interviewed.

172
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,475
Uh, should I go
and light the candle first, sir?

173
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,685
What? No.

174
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:55,067
- Experience?
- Hotel Kinski, kitchen boy, six months.

175
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:57,445
Hotel Berlitz, mop and broom boy,
three months.

176
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:00,156
- Before that I was a skillet scrubber -
- Experience: zero.

177
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:02,450
- Thank you again, Mr. Gustave.
- Straighten that cap, Anatole.

178
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,618
- The pleasure's mine, Herr Schneider.
- The strap's busted.

179
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:06,245
- These are not acceptable.
- I fully agree.

180
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:09,331
- Education?
- I studied reading and spelling.

181
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:11,792
I started my primary school. I almost -

182
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:13,878
- Education: zero.
- Now it's exploded.

183
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,046
Good morning, Cicero.
Call the goddamn plumber.

184
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,632
- This afternoon, Monsieur Gustave?
- Without fail, Frau Leibling.

185
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:20,342
- What in hell is this?
- Not now.

186
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,011
Family?

187
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,307
Zero.

188
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:28,642
Six, Igor.

189
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:38,277
Why do you want to be a lobby boy?

190
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:44,950
Well, who wouldn't
at the Grand Budapest, sir?

191
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:46,619
It's an institution.

192
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,373
Very good.

193
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:08,974
- A thousand Klubecks.
- My goodness.

194
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,977
Were you ever a lobby boy, sir?

195
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:14,355
What do you think?

196
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,482
Well, I suppose you'd have
to start somewhere -

197
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,275
- Go and light the goddamn candle.
- Yes, sir.

198
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,449
<i>And so, my life began.</i>

199
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:31,121
<i>Junior lobby boy in training,
Grand Budapest Hotel,</i>

200
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,999
<i>under the strict command
of Monsieur Gustave H.</i>

201
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,836
<i>I became his pupil, and he was to be
my counselor and guardian.</i>

202
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,755
<i>What is a lobby boy?</i>

203
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:43,342
<i>A lobby boy's completely invisible,
yet always in sight.</i>

204
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,594
<i>A lobby boy remembers what people hate.</i>

205
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:49,890
<i>A lobby boy anticipates the client's needs
before the needs are needed.</i>

206
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:53,185
<i>A lobby boy is, above all,
discreet to a fault.</i>

207
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:57,106
Our guests know their deepest secrets,
some of which are rather unseemly,

208
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:59,149
will go with us to our graves.

209
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,694
- So keep your mouth shut, Zero.
- Yes, sir.

210
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,698
That's all for now.

211
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,367
<i>I began to realize
that many of the hotel's</i>

212
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,246
<i>most valued and distinguished guests
came for him.</i>

213
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,373
<i>It seemed to be
an essential part of his duties -</i>

214
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,585
<i>...but I believe it was also his pleasure.</i>

215
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:21,672
<i>The requirements were always the same.</i>

216
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:24,341
<i>They had to be rich,</i>

217
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:27,011
<i>old, insecure,</i>

218
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,722
<i>vain, superficial,</i>

219
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:31,223
<i>blond,</i>

220
00:15:31,307 --> 00:15:32,725
<i>needy.</i>

221
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:35,519
Why blond?

222
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,440
Because they all were.

223
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:41,483
<i>He was, by the way,</i>

224
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,486
<i>the most liberally perfumed man
I had ever encountered.</i>

225
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:47,781
<i>The scent announced his approach
from a great distance -</i>

226
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,827
<i>...and lingered for many minutes
after he was gone.</i>

227
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,874
<i>I worked six days each week
plus a half-day Sunday,</i>

228
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,209
<i>5:00 a.m. until just after midnight.</i>

229
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:03,297
<i>Our meals were small but frequent,
for stamina.</i>

230
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,966
<i>Two breakfasts,
two lunches and a late supper.</i>

231
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:10,304
<i>Monsieur Gustave also delivered
a nightly sermon.</i>

232
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:13,849
Rudeness is merely the expression of fear.

233
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,101
People fear they won't get what they want.

234
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:19,938
The most dreadful and unattractive person
only needs to be loved

235
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,149
and they will open up like a flower.

236
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:24,360
I'm reminded of a verse:

237
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,987
"The painter's brush
touched the inchoate face

238
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:29,156
by ends of nimble bristles

239
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:33,035
and with their blush of first color,
rendered her lifeless cheek living."

240
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,372
<i>His own dinner, he took alone in his room.</i>

241
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:45,673
<i>The identity of the owner of the hotel
was unknown to all of us.</i>

242
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:49,176
<i>Each month, his emissary,
known as Deputy Kovacs,</i>

243
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,929
<i>arrived to review the books
and convey messages</i>

244
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,431
<i>on behalf of the mysterious proprietor.</i>

245
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:58,602
<i>On these occasions, Monsieur Gustave
and our business manager, Herr Becker,</i>

246
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:01,814
<i>met with him in private consultation
above Reception.</i>

247
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,662
<i>This was also when I met Agatha.</i>

248
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:36,432
<i>But we won't discuss that.</i>

249
00:17:36,432 --> 00:18:06,432
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

250
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,485
- What do you want?
- Look.

251
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,408
- Dear God.
- I'm terribly sorry, sir.

252
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:38,827
- We must go to her.
- We must?

253
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:42,331
Tout de suite. She needs me,
and I need you to help me with my bags.

254
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:44,166
- <i>Tout va bien?
- Attendez-moi</i>, darling.

255
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,043
- How fast can you pack?
- Five minutes.

256
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:49,463
Do it. And a bottle of Pouilly-Jouvet '26
in an ice bucket with two glasses

257
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:52,549
so we don't have to drink the cat piss
they serve in the dining car.

258
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:03,018
I blame myself.

259
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,815
She tried to tell me
she had a premonition. I didn't listen.

260
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:11,735
All of Lutz will be dressed in black,
except her own ghastly, deceitful children

261
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,279
whom she loathed
and couldn't bear to kiss hello.

262
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:16,490
They'll be dancing like gypsies.

263
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,745
There's really no point
in doing anything in life,

264
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:24,206
because it's all over
in the blink of an eye.

265
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,583
The next thing you know,
rigor mortis sets in.

266
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,253
Oh, how the good die young.

267
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:32,798
With any luck, she's left a few Klubecks
for your old friend,

268
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:36,260
but one never knows until the ink
is dry on the death certificate.

269
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:39,596
She was dynamite in the sack, by the way.

270
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,101
She was 8<i>4</i>, Monsieur Gustave.

271
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,435
I've had older.

272
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,563
When you're young, it's all fillet steak,

273
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:50,649
but as the years go by,
you have to move on to the cheaper cuts,

274
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:53,110
which is fine with me,
because I like those.

275
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,779
More flavorful, or so they say.

276
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:00,951
Why are we stopping at a barley field?

277
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,010
Well, hello there, chaps.

278
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:21,138
- Documents, please.
- With pleasure.

279
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:29,521
It's not a very flattering portrait.
I was once considered a great beauty.

280
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:33,233
What does the "F" stand for? Fritz? Franz?

281
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:35,986
- Franz.
- I knew it!

282
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,739
He's making a funny face.

283
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:43,160
That's a migratory visa with stage three
worker status, Franz, darling.

284
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,620
He's with me.

285
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,915
Come outside, please.

286
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,793
Now, wait a minute. Sit down, Zero.
His papers are in order.

287
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:54,922
I cross-referenced them myself
with the Bureau of Labor and Servitude.

288
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:57,049
You can't arrest him
because he's a bloody immigrant.

289
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:58,759
He hasn't done anything wrong.

290
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:06,934
Stop it, damn you! Damn you!

291
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,227
Never mind, Monsieur Gustave!
Let them proceed!

292
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,312
Ow! That hurts!

293
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,690
Ah!

294
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:16,526
You filthy, goddamn,
pockmarked, fascist assholes!

295
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,071
Take your hands off my lobby boy!

296
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,543
- What's the problem?
- This is outrageous.

297
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:36,254
The young man works for me
at the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad.

298
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:39,591
Monsieur Gustave?

299
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:44,012
My name is Henckels.

300
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:48,850
I'm the son of Dr.
and Mrs. Wolfgang Henckels-Bergersdörfer.

301
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:50,769
Do you remember me?

302
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,440
I know exactly who you are. It's uncanny.
You're little Albert.

303
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:57,484
I'm terribly embarrassed. Release them.

304
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,445
Release them!

305
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:08,537
Hmm. Your colleague is stateless.

306
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,123
He'll need to apply
for a revised Special Transit Permit,

307
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:14,167
which at this point
may be very difficult to acquire.

308
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:15,669
Take this.

309
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:20,173
It's temporary,
but it's the best I can offer, I'm afraid.

310
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,050
And how's your wonderful mother?

311
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:25,429
- She's very well, thank you.
- I adore her. Send my love.

312
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:26,930
I will.

313
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:31,727
Your companion was very kind to me
when I was a lonely little boy.

314
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:35,230
My men and I apologize for disturbing you.

315
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:37,441
I beg your pardon, sir.

316
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,669
You see? There are still
faint glimmers of civilization left

317
00:22:57,753 --> 00:23:01,048
in this barbaric slaughterhouse
that was once known as humanity.

318
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:05,427
Indeed, that's what we provide
in our own modest, humble, insignificant -

319
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:08,346
Oh, fuck it.

320
00:23:40,295 --> 00:23:43,006
Where is she, Clotilde? Take me to her.

321
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,836
You're looking so well, darling.
You really are.

322
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,546
They've done a marvelous job.

323
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:26,591
I don't know what cream they've put on you
down at the morgue, but I want some.

324
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:28,844
Honestly, you look better
than you have in years.

325
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:30,595
You look like you're alive.

326
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:40,605
Oh, you changed it after all.
It's perfect.

327
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:42,649
- Clotilde?
<i>- Oui</i>, Monsieur Gustave?

328
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:44,693
A glass of chilled water
with no ice, please.

329
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:53,076
Oh. All right, then.

330
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:55,412
I shan't be long, darling.

331
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:59,416
<i>We were escorted
through a green baize door,</i>

332
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:02,711
<i>down a narrow service corridor
and into the butler's pantry.</i>

333
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:07,716
<i>A moment later,
the kitchen passage swung open</i>

334
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:11,136
<i>and a small servant dressed in white
jolted into the room.</i>

335
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:14,306
<i>I've never forgotten
the look on that man's face.</i>

336
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:16,975
What the devil is going on?

337
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:21,521
<i>I, myself, had never set foot
inside a house of this kind in my life.</i>

338
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:25,567
<i>I understood very little about the events
that were to follow,</i>

339
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,195
<i>but, eventually, I came to recognize:</i>

340
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:31,698
<i>when the destiny of a great fortune
is at stake,</i>

341
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:36,494
<i>men's greed spreads
like a poison in the bloodstream.</i>

342
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,791
<i>Uncles, nephews, cousins,</i>

343
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:44,753
<i>in-laws of increasingly
tenuous connection.</i>

344
00:25:44,836 --> 00:25:48,673
<i>The old woman's most distant relations
had come foraging out of the woodwork.</i>

345
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:54,804
<i>At the head of this congregation -
it was a disorienting coincidence -</i>

346
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:57,557
<i>we discovered our own Deputy Kovacs,</i>

347
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:00,393
<i>himself an important attorney, of course.</i>

348
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:04,189
<i>He was the executor
of the dead widow's estate.</i>

349
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:13,782
This is Madame D's
last will and testament.

350
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:17,160
It consists of a general tontine

351
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:21,248
drawn up before the event
of her husband's death <i>4</i>6 years ago,

352
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:24,626
in combination with 635 amendments,

353
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:27,545
notations,
corrections and letters of wishes

354
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:30,674
executed during the subsequent decades.

355
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:36,179
The ultimate legality of this accumulation
requires further analysis,

356
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:39,432
but in the opinion of this office,
it was Madame D's intention

357
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:41,518
that control
of the vast bulk of her estate

358
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:44,271
should be transferred, forthwith,
to her son, Dmitri,

359
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:49,693
with special allowances for his sisters,
Marguerite, Laetizia and Carolina,

360
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:53,071
and minor gifts for various members
of the extended family

361
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:56,658
as shown in the List of Recipients,
which I will elucidate in due course.

362
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:00,120
However...

363
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,041
an additional codicil,

364
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:08,545
delivered into my possession by post
only this morning,

365
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:12,632
and, by all indications, sent by Madame D
during the last hours of her life,

366
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:15,635
contains an amendment
to the original certificate,

367
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:19,431
which, as prescribed by law,
I will read to you now.

368
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:21,016
The authenticity of this document

369
00:27:21,099 --> 00:27:23,601
has not yet been confirmed
by the presiding magistrate,

370
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:27,439
so I ask that all parties be patient
and refrain from comment

371
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:30,775
until such time as our investigations
can be completed.

372
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:43,079
"To my esteemed friend
who comforted me in my later years

373
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:45,623
and brought sunshine
into the life of an old woman

374
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:48,460
who thought that she would
never be happy again,

375
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:50,545
Monsieur Gustave H...

376
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:55,175
I bequeath, bestow and devise,
free of all taxation

377
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:57,677
and with full and absolute
fiduciary entitlement...

378
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:00,305
the painting known as <i>Boy with Apple -</i>

379
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:02,223
- Wow!
- ...by Johannes van Hoytl -

380
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:03,808
- I can't believe it.
- ...the younger -

381
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:06,394
- What?
- ...which gave us both so much pleasure."

382
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:07,479
The van Hoytl?

383
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:08,730
- Tax-free?
- Can she do that?

384
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:10,815
Who's Gustave H?

385
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,818
I'm afraid that's me, darling.

386
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:17,989
That fucking faggot!

387
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:21,284
He's a concierge. What are you doing here?

388
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:24,329
I've come to pay my respects
to a great woman whom I loved.

389
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,832
- This man is an intruder in my home.
- It's not yours yet, Dmitri.

390
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:30,126
Only when probate is granted,
and the Deed of Entitlement -

391
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,712
You're not getting <i>Boy with Apple,</i>
you goddamn little fruit.

392
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,633
How's that supposed to make me feel?

393
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,718
Call the police. We're pressing charges.

394
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:42,097
This criminal has plagued my family
for nearly 20 years.

395
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,182
He's a ruthless adventurer
and a con artist

396
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:46,393
who preys on mentally feeble,
sick old ladies.

397
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:50,980
- And he probably fucks them, too.
- I go to bed with all my friends.

398
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:02,659
Where's Céline?

399
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:06,371
What? She's dead. We're reading her will.

400
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:08,748
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

401
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:13,128
If I learn you ever once laid a finger
on my mother's body, living or dead,

402
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:15,547
I swear to God, I'll cut your throat.
You hear me?

403
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,674
I thought I was supposed to be
a fucking faggot.

404
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,637
- You are, but you're bisexual.
- Let's change the subject. I'm leaving.

405
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,524
That picture, <i>Boy with Apple,</i>
is priceless.

406
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:36,901
- Understand?
- Congratulations, Monsieur Gustave.

407
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:38,820
They're going to fight me
for the son of a bitch.

408
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:41,239
- Is it very beautiful?
- Beyond description.

409
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:43,950
"E'en the most gifted bard's rhyme
can only sing

410
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:46,119
but to the lack of her and all she isn't!

411
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:47,912
- His tongue doth -"
- Can I see it?

412
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,206
I don't see why not.

413
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:25,116
This is van Hoytl's exquisite portrayal

414
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,410
of a beautiful boy on the cusp of manhood.

415
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:30,288
Blond, smooth. Skin as white as that milk.

416
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:32,040
Of impeccable provenance.

417
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:35,251
One of the last in private hands,
and unquestionably the best.

418
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:37,212
It's a masterpiece.

419
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:39,214
The rest of this shit is worthless junk.

420
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:39,482
Mm-hmm.

421
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:00,920
What did you want to tell me, before?

422
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:03,881
I think I cannot say right now.

423
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:06,384
Write me tomorrow. Lutzbahn Station!

424
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:20,189
I'll never part with it.

425
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:25,028
It reminded her of me.
It will remind me of her. Always.

426
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:27,697
I'll die with this picture above my bed.

427
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,741
See the resemblance?

428
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:32,952
Oh - Oh, yes.

429
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,460
Actually, we should sell it.

430
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:43,838
Sooner rather than later,
in case they try to steal it back.

431
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:46,799
Plus, something about those lunatic
foot soldiers on the express.

432
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:50,261
This could be a tricky war
and a long dry spell in the hotel trade.

433
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:52,680
For all we know,
they could board us up tomorrow.

434
00:32:59,187 --> 00:33:02,565
Let's make a solemn blood pact:
we'll contact the black market

435
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:04,901
and liquidate <i>Boy with Apple</i>
by the end of the week,

436
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:07,987
then leave the country and lay low
somewhere along the Maltese Riviera

437
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:10,698
until the troubles blow over
and we resume our posts.

438
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:14,661
In exchange for your help, your loyalty
and your services as my personal valet,

439
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:19,123
I pledge to you 1.5%
of the net sale's price.

440
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:21,584
- 1.5?
- Plus room and board.

441
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,505
- Could we make it ten?
- Ten? Are you joking?

442
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:27,423
That's more than I'd pay an actual dealer,

443
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:29,842
and you wouldn't know
chiaroscuro from chicken giblets.

444
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:31,844
No, 1.5 is correct,
but I'll tell you what:

445
00:33:31,928 --> 00:33:35,223
if I die first, and I most certainly will,
you will be my sole heir.

446
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:38,226
There's not much in the kitty
except a set of ivory-backed hairbrushes

447
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:39,811
and my library of romantic poetry,

448
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:42,730
but when the time comes,
these will be yours,

449
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:45,775
along with whatever we haven't already
spent on whores and whiskey.

450
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:47,777
This is our sacred bond.

451
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,446
I'll draw it up right now.

452
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,206
I, Monsieur Gustave H,
being of relatively sound mind and body,

453
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:04,252
on this day, the 19th of October,
in the year of our Lord 1932...

454
00:34:04,335 --> 00:34:06,713
<i>He never told me
where he came from.</i>

455
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:12,760
<i>I never asked who his family had been.</i>

456
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:35,074
Excuse me.

457
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:37,493
Uh-huh?

458
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:42,081
The police are here. They asked for you.

459
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,503
Tell them I'll be right down.

460
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:50,339
Okay.

461
00:34:56,387 --> 00:34:59,348
- Ever been questioned by the authorities?
- Yes, on one occasion.

462
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:02,268
I was arrested and tortured by the rebel
militia after the Desert Uprising.

463
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,604
- Right. You know the drill, then. Zip it.
- Of course.

464
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:06,439
- You've never heard the word "van Hoytl."
- Got it.

465
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:07,607
Okay, let's go.

466
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:24,957
How may we serve you, gentlemen?

467
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:27,668
Ah, Inspector Henckels.

468
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:30,296
By order of the Commissioner of Police,
Zubrowka Province,

469
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:32,465
I hereby place you under arrest
for the murder

470
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:34,884
of Madame Céline Villeneuve
Desgoffe und Taxis.

471
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:38,179
I knew there was something fishy.
We never got the cause of death.

472
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:41,474
She's been murdered
and you think I did it.

473
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:44,477
Hey!

474
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:48,231
Stop!

475
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:39,782
What happened?

476
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:43,119
What happened, my dear Zero,
is I beat the living shit

477
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:45,830
out of a sniveling little runt
called Pinky Bandinski,

478
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:47,957
who had the gall to question my virility.

479
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,251
If there's one thing we've learned
from penny dreadfuls,

480
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:52,503
it's that, when you find yourself
in a place like this,

481
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:54,255
you must never be a candy-ass.

482
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:57,967
You've got to prove yourself from day one.
You've got to win their respect.

483
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:01,304
You should take a long look
at his ugly mug this morning.

484
00:37:03,681 --> 00:37:06,475
He's actually become a dear friend.

485
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,227
You'll meet him, I hope.

486
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:13,024
- So, you've talked to Kovacs?
- I saw him last night in secret.

487
00:37:13,107 --> 00:37:15,401
He made me take an oath on a Bible
I wouldn't tell a soul.

488
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:17,862
- You're supposed to also.
- I'll do that later.

489
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:20,323
- He suspects you're innocent.
- Of course he does.

490
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:22,491
What's the charge?

491
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:27,038
In the small hours
of the evening of 19 October,

492
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:30,333
an individual well known to the house
and staff, a Monsieur Gustave H,

493
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:33,669
did arrive at the Desgoffe und Taxis
residence in Lutz

494
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:37,673
and entered by the rear service alley,
alerting no one to his presence,

495
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:41,636
and did then proceed by way
of back stairs and servants' passage,

496
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:44,931
to deliver himself into
the private chambers of Madame D.

497
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:47,141
There is no evidence
to indicate whether this visit

498
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:49,810
had been prearranged with her or not.

499
00:37:49,894 --> 00:37:54,690
The next morning Madame D
was found dead by strychnine poisoning.

500
00:37:54,774 --> 00:37:57,234
Monsieur Gustave was not observed
on the premises again

501
00:37:57,318 --> 00:38:00,363
until, of course, 2<i>4</i>hours later.

502
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,493
The identity of his accusers is made clear
in this notarized deposition.

503
00:38:05,576 --> 00:38:08,913
They include, essentially,
all members of the extended family,

504
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:14,168
but the key witness who actually,
ostensibly, saw the alleged events

505
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,754
appears to have fled the jurisdiction.

506
00:38:16,837 --> 00:38:18,547
His whereabouts are currently unknown,

507
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:21,384
but he's being sought and pursued
by the relevant authorities.

508
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:23,678
Who is he?

509
00:38:27,682 --> 00:38:29,934
- Serge?
- I'm afraid so.

510
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,644
That little prick.

511
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:34,897
No, I don't believe it.
They put him up to it.

512
00:38:34,981 --> 00:38:38,275
- I've been dropped into a nest of vipers.
- You have an alibi?

513
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:40,903
Of course, but she's married
to the Duke of Westfalia.

514
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:43,489
I can't allow her name to get mixed up
in all this monkey business.

515
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:47,326
- Your life may be at stake.
- I know, but the bitch legged it.

516
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:51,330
She's already onboard the <i>Queen Nastassja</i>
halfway to Dutch Tanganyika.

517
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,209
Don't give up.

518
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,384
<i>The details of the conspiracy,</i>

519
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,137
<i>now a matter of public record,</i>

520
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,390
<i>were, at that time,
impossible for us to apprehend.</i>

521
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:31,620
I'm looking for Serge X,
a young man in the service of my employer,

522
00:39:31,704 --> 00:39:35,041
the family Desgoffe und Taxis
of Schloss Lutz.

523
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:38,252
- Yes, sir?
- You're his sister?

524
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:40,838
- Yes, sir.
- Seen him lately?

525
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:44,133
- No, sir.
- No, sir?

526
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:46,218
No, sir.

527
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,185
I need to find him right away,
for his own safety and everybody else's.

528
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:55,352
If he shows up -

529
00:39:57,146 --> 00:40:01,150
- Yes, sir?
- Tell him Jopling says... "Come home."

530
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:06,822
<i>But one thing was certain...</i>

531
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:12,870
<i>the Desgoffe und Taxis
were a very powerful family...</i>

532
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:19,418
<i>and time was not on our side.</i>

533
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:29,887
A letter from Monsieur Gustave. Zero.

534
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:32,640
- You want me to...?
- Read it.

535
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:40,731
"My dear and trusted colleagues -"

536
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:43,359
I miss you deeply
as I write from the confines

537
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:46,028
of my regrettable
and preposterous incarceration.

538
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:48,739
Until I walk amongst you again
as a free man,

539
00:40:48,823 --> 00:40:53,786
the Grand Budapest remains in your hands,
as does its impeccable reputation.

540
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,913
Keep it spotless and glorify it.

541
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:58,457
Take extra special care
of every little-bitty bit of it

542
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,751
as if I were watching over you like a hawk

543
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:04,463
with a horse whip in its talons,
because I am.

544
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:07,800
Should I discover a lapse
of any variety during my absence,

545
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:11,470
I promise swift and merciless justice
will descend upon you.

546
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:15,641
A great and noble house
has been placed under your protection.

547
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:18,269
Tell Zero if you see any funny business.

548
00:41:18,352 --> 00:41:20,813
"Your devoted Monsieur Gustave."

549
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:24,817
Then there's a poem, but we might want to
start on the soup since it's <i>4</i>6 stanzas.

550
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:29,822
"A moist, black ash dampens
the filth of a dung-dark rat's nest

551
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:32,116
and mingles with the thick scent
of wood rot

552
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,909
while the lark song of a guttersnipe -"

553
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:36,495
I never trusted that butler.

554
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:39,331
- He's too honest.
<i>- Too honest, you say?</i>

555
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:40,457
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

556
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:44,879
<i>Right, well, be that as it may,
find him quick and make it snappy.</i>

557
00:42:01,145 --> 00:42:03,647
May I offer any of you inmates
a plate of mush?

558
00:42:06,025 --> 00:42:07,735
No? Anyone?

559
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:10,112
You with the very large scar on your face?

560
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:22,291
Try it. It's actually quite warm
and nourishing this morning.

561
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:23,542
It needs a dash of salt.

562
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:33,552
Good day.

563
00:42:39,058 --> 00:42:40,893
Mush, gents? Any takers?

564
00:42:45,022 --> 00:42:46,482
Suit yourselves.

565
00:42:52,321 --> 00:42:53,697
Rise and shine. Chop-chop.

566
00:42:55,366 --> 00:42:56,492
Good morning, Pinky.

567
00:43:02,373 --> 00:43:04,583
- Mendl's again?
- Precisely.

568
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:06,669
Who's got the throat-slitter?

569
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:15,803
- Out of this world.
- Mendl's is the best.

570
00:43:15,886 --> 00:43:18,013
- Well, back to work.
- Monsieur Gustave?

571
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,144
Yes?

572
00:43:27,147 --> 00:43:29,024
Me and the boys talked it over.

573
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:31,694
We think you're a really straight fellow.

574
00:43:32,486 --> 00:43:36,240
Well, I've never been accused of that
before, but I appreciate the sentiment.

575
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:37,825
You're one of us now.

576
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:40,828
What a lovely thing to say.

577
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:44,790
Thank you, dear Pinky. Thank you, Günther.
Thank you, Wolf.

578
00:43:45,332 --> 00:43:46,625
Anything else?

579
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:49,878
Tell him, Ludwig.

580
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:54,883
Checkpoint 19 ain't no two-bit hoosegow.

581
00:43:55,426 --> 00:43:58,595
You got broad-gauge iron bars
on every door, vent and window.

582
00:43:59,013 --> 00:44:02,391
You got 72 guards on the floor
and 16 more in the towers.

583
00:44:02,474 --> 00:44:06,895
You got a 325-foot drop
into a moat full of crocodiles.

584
00:44:06,979 --> 00:44:09,064
But, like the best of them,
it's got a soft spot,

585
00:44:09,148 --> 00:44:11,317
which in this case
happens to take the form

586
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,402
of a storm drain sewer system

587
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:15,863
dating from the time
of the original rock fortification

588
00:44:15,946 --> 00:44:17,698
way back in the Middle Ages.

589
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:21,618
Now, nobody's saying it's a stroll
down a tree-lined promenade

590
00:44:21,702 --> 00:44:23,287
with a fine lady and a white poodle,

591
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:26,749
but it's got what you'd call...
vulnerability,

592
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:29,418
and that's our bread and butter.

593
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:32,129
Take a look.

594
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:35,632
Who drew this?

595
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:37,926
What do you mean, "Who drew this?" I did.

596
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:42,097
Very good. You've got a wonderful line.
This shows great artistic promise.

597
00:44:42,598 --> 00:44:45,684
Question: how do you intend to penetrate
this lowest rudiment?

598
00:44:45,768 --> 00:44:49,146
It's 25 inches of reinforced
granite masonry, is it not?

599
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:51,482
Digging with the throat-slitter,
this would take

600
00:44:51,565 --> 00:44:53,484
three-to-six months of continual effort,

601
00:44:53,567 --> 00:44:56,487
during which time several of our members
will have been violently executed.

602
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,947
You hit the nail on the head, Mr. Gustave.

603
00:44:59,365 --> 00:45:01,867
We got fake documents,
second-hand street clothes,

604
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:04,453
a rope ladder
made of sticks and bunk linens,

605
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:06,663
but we need digging tools,

606
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:09,708
which are proving hard to come by
in this flophouse.

607
00:45:24,473 --> 00:45:27,309
<i>At this point in the story,
the old man fell silent</i>

608
00:45:27,393 --> 00:45:29,686
<i>and pushed away his saddle of lamb.</i>

609
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:32,731
<i>His eyes went blank as two stones.</i>

610
00:45:32,815 --> 00:45:34,733
<i>I could see he was in distress.</i>

611
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,694
- Are you ill, Mr. Moustafa?
<i>- I finally asked.</i>

612
00:45:37,778 --> 00:45:40,197
- Oh, dear me, no.
<i>- He said.</i>

613
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,616
It's only that I don't know
how to proceed.

614
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:45,536
<i>He was crying.</i>

615
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:48,872
You see, I never speak of Agatha, because

616
00:45:49,415 --> 00:45:51,500
even at the thought of her name,

617
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:54,044
I'm unable to control my emotions.

618
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,675
Well, I suppose there's no way around it.

619
00:46:01,176 --> 00:46:03,429
You see, she saved us.

620
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:05,889
<i>On our third formal rendezvous,</i>

621
00:46:05,973 --> 00:46:08,767
<i>I had asked for her hand in marriage
and she had agreed.</i>

622
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:10,269
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

623
00:46:12,646 --> 00:46:15,649
<i>We did not have 50 Klubecks
between the two of us.</i>

624
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:19,111
<i>No one knew, of course,
but, then, who would have cared?</i>

625
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:21,864
<i>We were each
completely on our own in the world...</i>

626
00:46:23,073 --> 00:46:24,992
<i>and we were deeply in love.</i>

627
00:46:33,876 --> 00:46:35,836
- Here.
- Thank you.

628
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:37,880
- It's a book.
- I see.

629
00:46:37,963 --> 00:46:39,381
<i>Romantic Poetry, Volume One.</i>

630
00:46:39,465 --> 00:46:42,134
Monsieur Gustave recommended it.
I have a copy of my own as well.

631
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:45,596
- I ruined the surprise, I suppose.
- I'll go ahead and open it, anyway.

632
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:47,556
Okay.

633
00:46:49,725 --> 00:46:51,059
Read the inscription.

634
00:47:10,037 --> 00:47:12,122
<i>Monsieur Gustave insisted on an immediate</i>

635
00:47:12,206 --> 00:47:13,707
<i>and thorough cross-examination -</i>

636
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,585
She's charming. She's so charming.

637
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:19,421
<i>... during which he
presented Agatha with a porcelain pendant</i>

638
00:47:19,505 --> 00:47:22,549
<i>and five dozen individually
tissue-wrapped white tulips</i>

639
00:47:22,633 --> 00:47:24,676
<i>in a box the size of a child's coffin.</i>

640
00:47:25,177 --> 00:47:27,804
- It's not right.
- I beg your pardon?

641
00:47:27,888 --> 00:47:28,972
Why is he sulking?

642
00:47:29,056 --> 00:47:31,058
She's my girlfriend.
You can't just buy her things.

643
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:34,811
I'm only interviewing
this vision of loveliness on your behalf.

644
00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:37,397
Never be jealous in this life, Zero,
not even for an instant.

645
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:39,149
Is he flirting with you?

646
00:47:40,484 --> 00:47:43,570
- Yes.
- I approve of this union.

647
00:47:43,654 --> 00:47:46,490
Agatha, my beauty, return to your beloved.

648
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:47,991
<i>Soon we learned -</i>

649
00:47:48,075 --> 00:47:49,701
Blessings upon you both.

650
00:47:49,785 --> 00:47:51,787
<i>...not only was Agatha immensely skilled</i>

651
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:54,289
<i>with a palette knife
and a butter cream flourish -</i>

652
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,124
- Mendl.
- Go.

653
00:47:57,793 --> 00:47:59,795
<i>...she was also very brave.</i>

654
00:48:04,258 --> 00:48:06,260
<i>I believe she was born that way.</i>

655
00:48:25,654 --> 00:48:27,197
Something's missing.

656
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:32,578
A crucial document, either misplaced or,
conceivably, destroyed.

657
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:35,289
I don't know what it contains,
I don't know what it represents,

658
00:48:35,372 --> 00:48:36,873
I don't know what it is,

659
00:48:36,957 --> 00:48:39,960
but there are traces
and shadows of it everywhere.

660
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:41,878
Now, I don't want to alarm you,

661
00:48:41,962 --> 00:48:44,006
and I don't expect to see
any significant change

662
00:48:44,089 --> 00:48:47,217
in the magistrate's ultimate decision
vis-à-vis your own inheritance,

663
00:48:47,301 --> 00:48:51,013
but, especially given
the circumstances of the death,

664
00:48:51,096 --> 00:48:53,348
as well as the disappearance
of the key witness

665
00:48:53,432 --> 00:48:55,684
in the murder case, Serge X -

666
00:48:55,767 --> 00:48:57,936
...I suggest that we immediately
bring this matter

667
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,188
to the attention
of the municipal inspector

668
00:49:00,272 --> 00:49:02,149
so that there can be
absolutely no question

669
00:49:02,232 --> 00:49:04,735
of impropriety at any future date.

670
00:49:04,818 --> 00:49:06,486
- Agreed?
- Not agreed.

671
00:49:08,405 --> 00:49:10,407
- Not agreed?
- Not agreed.

672
00:49:12,993 --> 00:49:16,371
- Can I ask you a question, Vilmos?
- Yes, Dmitri?

673
00:49:16,455 --> 00:49:19,249
- Who are you working for?
- I beg your pardon?

674
00:49:19,333 --> 00:49:23,211
Who are you working for? I thought
you're supposed to be our lawyer.

675
00:49:24,254 --> 00:49:27,007
Well, in point of fact,
I'm the executor of the estate.

676
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:31,136
In this particular situation,
I represent the deceased.

677
00:49:31,637 --> 00:49:33,055
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

678
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:35,223
A provision for my fees
was included in the -

679
00:49:35,307 --> 00:49:40,228
Just wrap it up and don't make waves.
Agreed?

680
00:49:42,314 --> 00:49:46,360
I'm an attorney, Dmitri. I'm obligated
to proceed according to the rule of law.

681
00:49:47,736 --> 00:49:48,779
Not agreed.

682
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:58,622
This stinks, sisters.

683
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:02,918
Did he just throw my cat out the window?

684
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:07,005
- I don't think so.
- No. Did he?

685
00:50:18,517 --> 00:50:20,477
Shh!

686
00:50:33,949 --> 00:50:35,158
Okay.

687
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:48,630
There's something
I haven't told you, Agatha.

688
00:50:49,548 --> 00:50:51,007
- Okay.
- We stole a painting.

689
00:50:51,091 --> 00:50:53,927
It's very valuable,
maybe five million Klubecks, in fact.

690
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:57,389
I don't know if anyone's even noticed,
but if something should happen to me -

691
00:50:57,472 --> 00:50:59,099
You steal art?

692
00:51:00,267 --> 00:51:03,437
One picture. Anyway,
we need to make a plan for your survival.

693
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,440
Hide this. It's in code and you might
need a magnifying glass to read it,

694
00:51:06,523 --> 00:51:08,900
but it tells you exactly where and how
to find <i>Boy with Apple.</i>

695
00:51:08,984 --> 00:51:11,153
Don't take less than half
the retail asking price. Also -

696
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:14,072
- Zero, I'm a baker.
- You're a pastry chef.

697
00:51:14,156 --> 00:51:18,034
I'm not a fence, if that's the term.
I don't trade in stolen property.

698
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:22,497
I said it wrong. She willed it to him.

699
00:51:30,589 --> 00:51:32,090
Go to sleep.

700
00:51:33,258 --> 00:51:35,010
Yes, Herr Mendl.

701
00:51:37,846 --> 00:51:39,055
- Hide this.
- No.

702
00:51:39,806 --> 00:51:41,433
Okay, but take it anyway.

703
00:55:07,806 --> 00:55:10,934
<i>The next morning,
Herr Becker received a peculiar,</i>

704
00:55:11,017 --> 00:55:14,062
<i>last-minute notice
from the office of Deputy Kovacs</i>

705
00:55:14,145 --> 00:55:18,608
<i>postponing their scheduled meeting...
in perpetuity.</i>

706
00:55:48,722 --> 00:55:50,015
Let's blow.

707
00:57:00,794 --> 00:57:03,046
- How did you get out there?
- Shut the fuck up.

708
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:05,882
These guys are trying to escape.

709
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:07,801
What's wrong with you, you goddamn snitch?

710
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:09,719
Guard! Guard!

711
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:20,855
It's you. Thank you.
Thank you, you sweet, kind man.

712
00:57:51,136 --> 00:57:52,220
Okay.

713
00:58:44,689 --> 00:58:45,857
Whoa!

714
00:59:06,961 --> 00:59:08,963
I suppose you'd call that a draw.

715
00:59:18,765 --> 00:59:19,933
Good evening.

716
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:29,067
Stand up.

717
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:32,779
Let me introduce you. Pinky, Wolf, Ludwig,
this is the divine Zero.

718
00:59:32,862 --> 00:59:34,948
Günther was slain in the catacombs.

719
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:37,867
Well, boys, who knows when
we'll all meet again, but if one day -

720
00:59:37,951 --> 00:59:38,952
Hold it.

721
00:59:42,372 --> 00:59:43,706
No time to gab.

722
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,501
Take care of yourself, Mr. Gustave.

723
00:59:47,126 --> 00:59:48,294
Good luck, kid.

724
00:59:52,757 --> 00:59:56,010
- Which way to the safe house?
- I couldn't find one.

725
00:59:56,094 --> 00:59:59,013
No safe house? Really?
We're completely on our own out here?

726
00:59:59,097 --> 01:00:02,392
I'm afraid so. I asked around, but, uh -

727
01:00:02,475 --> 01:00:05,395
I understand. Too risky.
We'll just have to wing it, I suppose.

728
01:00:05,478 --> 01:00:07,313
Let's put on our disguises.

729
01:00:08,231 --> 01:00:10,358
- We're wearing them.
- No, we're not.

730
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:12,986
We said false whiskers
and fake noses and so on.

731
01:00:13,069 --> 01:00:15,863
- You didn't bring any?
- I thought you were growing one.

732
01:00:15,947 --> 01:00:18,950
And it wouldn't -
it wouldn't look realistic, would it?

733
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:21,369
No, when done properly,
they're perfectly convincing.

734
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:23,329
But I take your point. So be it.

735
01:00:23,413 --> 01:00:25,957
Give me a few squirts of L'air de Panache,
please, will you?

736
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:31,045
- Can I not get a squirt, even?
- I forgot the L'air de Panache.

737
01:00:31,129 --> 01:00:33,798
Honestly, you forgot the L'air de Panache?

738
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:36,968
I don't believe it. How could you?

739
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:40,138
I've been in jail, Zero.
Do you understand how humiliating this is?

740
01:00:40,805 --> 01:00:42,265
I smell.

741
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:45,893
Huh, that's just marvelous, isn't it?

742
01:00:46,519 --> 01:00:50,398
I suppose this is to be expected back in -
where do you come from again?

743
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:52,108
- Aq Salim al-Jabat.
- Precisely.

744
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:54,861
I suppose this is to be expected
back in Aq Salim al-Jabat,

745
01:00:54,944 --> 01:00:56,321
where one's prized possessions

746
01:00:56,404 --> 01:00:58,406
are a stack of filthy carpets
and a starving goat,

747
01:00:58,489 --> 01:01:02,410
and one sleeps behind a tent flap
and survives on wild dates and scarabs,

748
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:04,620
but it's not how I trained you.

749
01:01:05,204 --> 01:01:08,374
What possessed you to leave the homeland
where you very obviously belong

750
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:11,461
and travel unspeakable distances
to become a penniless immigrant

751
01:01:11,544 --> 01:01:13,629
in a refined, highly-cultivated society

752
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:16,674
that, quite frankly, could've gotten along
very well without you?

753
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:18,676
The war.

754
01:01:19,761 --> 01:01:21,054
Say again?

755
01:01:21,137 --> 01:01:23,473
Well, you see, my father was murdered

756
01:01:23,556 --> 01:01:26,309
and the rest of my family
were executed by firing squad.

757
01:01:26,392 --> 01:01:27,977
Our village was burned to the ground

758
01:01:28,061 --> 01:01:30,646
and those who managed to survive
were forced to flee.

759
01:01:31,481 --> 01:01:33,232
I left because of the war.

760
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:37,945
I see. So you're, actually,
really more of a refugee, in that sense?

761
01:01:39,197 --> 01:01:40,239
Truly.

762
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:44,035
Well, I suppose I'd better take back
everything I just said.

763
01:01:45,244 --> 01:01:48,331
What a bloody idiot I am. Pathetic fool.

764
01:01:48,915 --> 01:01:50,833
Goddamn selfish bastard.

765
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:53,961
This is disgraceful, and it's beneath
the standards of the Grand Budapest.

766
01:01:54,045 --> 01:01:57,673
I apologize
on behalf of the hotel.

767
01:01:57,757 --> 01:02:00,218
It's not your fault.
You were just upset I forgot the perfume.

768
01:02:00,301 --> 01:02:04,097
Don't make excuses for me.
I owe you my life.

769
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:08,684
You are my dear friend and protégé,
and I'm very proud of you.

770
01:02:08,768 --> 01:02:10,144
You must know that.

771
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,980
I'm so sorry, Zero.

772
01:02:14,816 --> 01:02:16,025
We're brothers.

773
01:02:24,867 --> 01:02:26,744
How's our darling Agatha?

774
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:32,875
"'Twas first light
when I saw her face upon the heath;

775
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:35,837
and hence did I return,
day by day, entranced:

776
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,840
tho' vinegar did brine my heart, never -"

777
01:02:38,923 --> 01:02:41,551
Very good. I'm going to stop you there
because the alarm has sounded,

778
01:02:41,634 --> 01:02:44,387
but remember where we left off
because I insist you finish later.

779
01:03:02,947 --> 01:03:05,783
I want roadblocks
at every junction for 50 kilometers.

780
01:03:05,867 --> 01:03:08,744
I want rail blocks
at every train station for 100 kilometers.

781
01:03:08,828 --> 01:03:11,789
I want 50 men and ten bloodhounds
ready in five minutes.

782
01:03:11,873 --> 01:03:15,209
We're going to strip search
every <i>pretzel-haus, waffel-hut</i>, biergarten

783
01:03:15,293 --> 01:03:19,088
and especially every grand hotel
from Äugenzburg to Zilchbrück.

784
01:03:19,172 --> 01:03:21,257
These men are dangerous,
professional criminals.

785
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:24,719
At least three of them are anyway.
Who are you?

786
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,765
What are you doing here?
Civilian personnel aren't permitted.

787
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:33,144
- This is a military investigation.
- This is Mr. Jopling, sir.

788
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:35,396
His employer's mother
was one of the victims -

789
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,522
Shut up.

790
01:03:38,983 --> 01:03:40,943
You work for the family
Desgoffe und Taxis?

791
01:03:41,486 --> 01:03:45,114
Are you aware of the murder of Deputy
Vilmos Kovacs on the 23rd of October?

792
01:03:45,615 --> 01:03:47,950
I'm aware of his disappearance.

793
01:03:48,034 --> 01:03:50,828
His body was found stuffed
in a sarcophagus behind a storage room

794
01:03:50,912 --> 01:03:52,455
at the Kunstmuseum late last night.

795
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:54,540
He was short four fingers.

796
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:58,169
- What do you know about that?
- Nothing.

797
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:01,714
Escort Mr. Jopling off the premises.

798
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:13,643
Mendl's.

799
01:04:19,148 --> 01:04:23,152
Operator, get me the Excelsior Palace
in Baden-Jürgen and reverse the charges.

800
01:04:23,236 --> 01:04:25,196
We've no choice.
There's nowhere else to turn.

801
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:26,697
I'll hold. Thank you.

802
01:04:26,781 --> 01:04:29,617
It's our only hope. Otherwise, I shouldn't
even mention its existence to you.

803
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,578
It goes without saying, never breathe
a word about this to a living soul.

804
01:04:32,662 --> 01:04:34,539
- Do you swear?
- Of course. What is it, in fact?

805
01:04:34,622 --> 01:04:38,167
I can't say.
<i>Guten Abend. Monsieur Ivan, bitte. Danke.</i>

806
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:40,336
How does one come by front-row aisle seats

807
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:43,798
for a first night at the Opera Toscana
with one day's notice?

808
01:04:43,881 --> 01:04:45,716
How does one arrange a private viewing

809
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:48,469
of the tapestry collection
at the Royal Saxon Gallery?

810
01:04:48,553 --> 01:04:52,640
How does one secure a corner table
at Chez Dominique on a Thursday?

811
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,268
Ivan, darling, it's Gustave. Hello.

812
01:04:55,351 --> 01:04:57,520
Well, I was until about five minutes ago.

813
01:04:57,603 --> 01:05:00,815
We've taken it upon ourselves to clear out
in a hurry, if you see what I mean.

814
01:05:00,898 --> 01:05:03,484
Well, through a sewer, as it happens.
Exactly.

815
01:05:03,568 --> 01:05:06,320
Listen, Ivan, I'm sorry to cut you off,
but we're in a bit of a bind.

816
01:05:06,404 --> 01:05:07,989
This is an official request.

817
01:05:08,531 --> 01:05:11,367
I'm formally calling
upon the special services of -

818
01:05:16,455 --> 01:05:18,040
I'll call you back, Gustave.

819
01:05:18,124 --> 01:05:20,167
Right. Stand by.

820
01:05:20,585 --> 01:05:23,254
I beg your pardon. Do you prefer to walk?

821
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:25,881
We're right here. It's very simple.

822
01:05:25,965 --> 01:05:27,758
Straight down the corniche, then left.

823
01:05:28,175 --> 01:05:29,885
Jojo, see the gentleman out.

824
01:05:33,222 --> 01:05:35,391
Get me Monsieur Georges
at the Château Luxe, please.

825
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:43,441
Take over.... ?

826
01:05:43,524 --> 01:05:44,734
<i>Hello, Ivan?</i>

827
01:05:46,819 --> 01:05:47,862
Got it.

828
01:05:48,988 --> 01:05:51,741
Get me Monsieur Dino
at the Palazzo Principessa, please.

829
01:05:53,326 --> 01:05:56,120
Higher, goddamn it. Higher!

830
01:05:56,203 --> 01:05:58,789
Take over.

831
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,125
- <i>Monsieur Georges.</i>
- Higher.

832
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:03,544
I see. Straightaway.

833
01:06:05,254 --> 01:06:07,590
Get me Monsieur Robin
at l'Hôtel Côte du Cap, please.

834
01:06:09,175 --> 01:06:11,010
...and two and three.

835
01:06:12,511 --> 01:06:15,473
Monsieur Robin.
There's a call from Monsieur Dino for you.

836
01:06:15,556 --> 01:06:16,891
Take over.

837
01:06:18,976 --> 01:06:21,646
- One, two, three.
<i>- Yes, Dino.</i>

838
01:06:22,313 --> 01:06:25,191
Yes, Dino. Okay, Dino.

839
01:06:27,318 --> 01:06:29,487
Get me Monsieur Martin
at the Ritz Imperial, please.

840
01:06:31,072 --> 01:06:32,406
Too much salt.

841
01:06:33,324 --> 01:06:34,700
Not enough pepper.

842
01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:37,453
- Monsieur, you have a call.
- Take over.

843
01:06:40,414 --> 01:06:42,500
- <i>Robin? Martin.</i>
- Too much salt.

844
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,251
So I've heard.

845
01:06:46,087 --> 01:06:49,048
Maybe. Let me make a few calls.

846
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:56,764
Serge X: missing.
Deputy Kovacs: also missing.

847
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:59,767
Madame D: dead.
<i>Boy with Apple</i>: stolen, by us.

848
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:02,645
Dmitri and Jopling:
ruthless, cold-blooded savages.

849
01:07:02,728 --> 01:07:05,856
Gustave H: at large. What else?

850
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:09,026
- Zero: confused.
- Zero: confused, indeed.

851
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:11,153
The plot thickens, as they say.

852
01:07:11,237 --> 01:07:13,989
Why, by the way? Is it a soup metaphor?

853
01:07:14,073 --> 01:07:15,991
I don't know.

854
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,498
Get in.

855
01:07:24,959 --> 01:07:26,210
We found the butler.

856
01:07:26,293 --> 01:07:29,547
He's hiding out in the remote foothills
near Gabelmeister's Peak.

857
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:31,716
Our contact convinced him
to meet you midday tomorrow

858
01:07:31,799 --> 01:07:33,300
at the observatory on the summit.

859
01:07:33,384 --> 01:07:35,845
Tell no one. He'll explain everything.

860
01:07:35,928 --> 01:07:37,930
Your train departs
in four and a half minutes.

861
01:07:38,013 --> 01:07:39,390
Here's your tickets.

862
01:07:39,807 --> 01:07:42,017
- Oh, third class?
- It was overbooked,

863
01:07:42,435 --> 01:07:46,147
but the conductor used to be a sommelier
at the old Versailles.

864
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:49,483
He pulled some strings.
You'll need these for the dining car.

865
01:07:52,194 --> 01:07:53,738
One last thing.

866
01:07:55,448 --> 01:07:57,199
L'air de Panache.

867
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:02,705
They only had the half-ounce.

868
01:08:07,209 --> 01:08:09,211
We should give him something
as a symbolic gesture.

869
01:08:09,295 --> 01:08:11,630
- How much money you got?
<i>- 4</i>2 Klubecks and three postage stamps.

870
01:08:11,714 --> 01:08:13,674
Give me 25. Yes.

871
01:08:17,386 --> 01:08:20,264
- Bless you.
- Please.

872
01:08:37,156 --> 01:08:38,949
- I've got to hand it to him.
<i>- Jesus Christ.</i>

873
01:08:39,033 --> 01:08:42,495
I didn't see that coming.
Well, what do you want next?

874
01:08:42,912 --> 01:08:48,250
<i>Talk to the club-footed sister again.
And, this time, be persuasive.</i>

875
01:08:55,674 --> 01:08:58,177
Goddamn son of a bitch.

876
01:09:21,742 --> 01:09:23,244
Holy fuck!

877
01:09:28,415 --> 01:09:30,167
What's the meaning of this shit?

878
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:32,837
<i>Boy with Apple</i>? I thought you'd hidden it.

879
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,548
- Why are you only noticing now?
- I assumed it went to the tax appraiser.

880
01:09:35,631 --> 01:09:38,551
- Are you fucking kidding me?
<i>- Excusez-moi.</i>

881
01:09:39,635 --> 01:09:42,555
I believe it was removed
by Monsieur Gustave.

882
01:09:50,521 --> 01:09:51,730
I'm not angry with Serge.

883
01:09:51,814 --> 01:09:54,400
You can't blame someone
for their basic lack of moral fiber.

884
01:09:54,483 --> 01:09:56,569
He's a frightened, little,
yellow-bellied coward.

885
01:09:56,652 --> 01:09:58,821
- It's not his fault, is it?
- I don't know. It depends.

886
01:09:58,904 --> 01:10:02,074
You can say that about most anything.
"It depends." Of course it depends.

887
01:10:02,157 --> 01:10:03,993
Of course it depends of course it depends.

888
01:10:04,076 --> 01:10:06,161
Yes, I suppose you're right.
Of course it depends.

889
01:10:06,245 --> 01:10:09,456
However, that doesn't mean I'm not going
to throttle the little swamp rat.

890
01:10:12,167 --> 01:10:15,838
May I officiate, by the way? The ceremony?

891
01:10:16,672 --> 01:10:17,965
With pleasure.

892
01:10:18,048 --> 01:10:20,593
I must say,
I find that girl utterly delightful.

893
01:10:20,676 --> 01:10:24,346
Flat as a board, enormous birthmark
the shape of Mexico over half her face,

894
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:26,640
sweating for hours on end
in that sweltering kitchen

895
01:10:26,724 --> 01:10:30,019
while Mendl, genius though he is,
looms over her like a hulking gorilla.

896
01:10:30,102 --> 01:10:32,396
Yet without question, without fail,

897
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:35,816
always and invariably,
she's exceedingly lovely.

898
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,192
Why?

899
01:10:38,068 --> 01:10:39,612
Because of her purity.

900
01:10:42,114 --> 01:10:44,325
She admires you as well, Monsieur Gustave.

901
01:10:44,867 --> 01:10:47,244
- Does she?
- Very much.

902
01:10:47,745 --> 01:10:51,248
That's a good sign, you know?
It means she "gets it."

903
01:10:51,999 --> 01:10:53,500
That's important.

904
01:10:55,961 --> 01:10:57,296
Don't flirt with her.

905
01:11:43,884 --> 01:11:47,221
A radio telegram was delivered
and signed for by the girl at <i>4</i>:00 a.m.

906
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:50,182
The envelope was found near the body,
but its contents were missing.

907
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:53,978
However, the telegraph office always keeps
a carbon of the ticker tape for 2<i>4</i>hours.

908
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:56,438
I copied it down. It reads as follows:

909
01:11:57,481 --> 01:11:58,774
"Pack your things. Stop.

910
01:11:58,857 --> 01:12:00,901
Be ready to leave at moment's notice.
Stop.

911
01:12:00,985 --> 01:12:03,529
Hideout is vicinity
of Gabelmeister's Peak. Stop.

912
01:12:03,612 --> 01:12:06,156
Destroy this message.
All my love. Full stop."

913
01:12:07,449 --> 01:12:09,159
Where's the basket?

914
01:12:34,393 --> 01:12:36,103
Where you headed, mister?

915
01:12:40,107 --> 01:12:42,443
Skiing? Sledding? Mountain climbing?

916
01:12:51,994 --> 01:12:53,245
Three Klubecks.

917
01:13:04,173 --> 01:13:07,092
<i>By express wireless,
I wrote Agatha with instructions</i>

918
01:13:07,176 --> 01:13:09,136
<i>to move to our prearranged hideout:</i>

919
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:11,847
<i>a Gypsy caravan
on the outer Nebelsbad road,</i>

920
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:15,434
<i>while Monsieur Gustave and I
continued east into the Zubrowkian Alps,</i>

921
01:13:15,517 --> 01:13:19,271
<i>toward our high-altitude rendezvous
with the butler Serge X.</i>

922
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:23,609
<i>As a precaution, we disembarked quietly</i>

923
01:13:23,692 --> 01:13:26,111
<i>in the freight yard
just outside the station.</i>

924
01:13:33,702 --> 01:13:35,162
L'air de Panache.

925
01:13:46,173 --> 01:13:48,592
It's a hell of a view.
I give them that.

926
01:13:48,675 --> 01:13:49,802
I agree.

927
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:05,192
"'Tis oft remarked:
no single, falling flake does any other

928
01:14:05,275 --> 01:14:07,319
- in its pure and perfect form -"
- Somebody's coming.

929
01:14:11,573 --> 01:14:14,701
Are you Monsieur Gustave
of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

930
01:14:14,785 --> 01:14:17,538
- Uh-huh.
- Get on the next cable car.

931
01:14:56,952 --> 01:15:00,497
Are you Monsieur Gustave
of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

932
01:15:01,081 --> 01:15:02,833
- Uh-huh.
- Switch with me.

933
01:15:32,446 --> 01:15:35,157
Are you Monsieur Gustave
of the Grand Budapest Hotel in Nebelsbad?

934
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:38,160
- Uh-huh.
- Put these on and sing.

935
01:16:04,186 --> 01:16:05,229
Psst.

936
01:16:06,313 --> 01:16:08,899
- Are you Monsieur Gustave of the -
- Yes, damn it!

937
01:16:09,441 --> 01:16:11,944
- Confess.
- I'm innocent!

938
01:16:12,444 --> 01:16:13,987
Hmm? No, no.

939
01:16:23,538 --> 01:16:26,333
Forgive me, Monsieur Gustave.
I never meant to betray you.

940
01:16:26,416 --> 01:16:29,294
They threatened my life
and now they've murdered my only family.

941
01:16:29,378 --> 01:16:31,088
No. Who did they kill this time?

942
01:16:31,171 --> 01:16:33,674
- My dear sister.
- The girl with the club foot?

943
01:16:33,757 --> 01:16:35,259
- Yes.
- Those fuckers!

944
01:16:35,342 --> 01:16:38,887
- I tried to warn you at the beginning.
- I know. Let's put that behind us.

945
01:16:38,971 --> 01:16:41,932
Listen, I hate to put you on the spot,
but I must ask you to clear my name.

946
01:16:42,015 --> 01:16:43,850
- Obviously, you're grieving -
- There's more.

947
01:16:43,934 --> 01:16:45,227
Okay.

948
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:46,603
- To the story.
- I get it. Go on.

949
01:16:46,687 --> 01:16:49,147
I was the official witness
in Madame D's presence

950
01:16:49,231 --> 01:16:50,774
to the creation of a second will

951
01:16:50,857 --> 01:16:53,860
to be executed only in the event
of her death by murder.

952
01:16:53,944 --> 01:16:55,570
- A second will?
- Right.

953
01:16:55,654 --> 01:16:57,322
- In case she got bumped off?
- Right.

954
01:16:57,406 --> 01:16:58,949
- Uh-huh?
- But they destroyed it.

955
01:16:59,032 --> 01:17:00,617
- Oh, dear.
- However -

956
01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:02,327
- Uh-huh?
- ...I pulled a copy.

957
01:17:03,203 --> 01:17:04,663
A second copy of the second will?

958
01:17:04,746 --> 01:17:06,164
- Right.
- Uh-huh?

959
01:17:09,293 --> 01:17:11,378
What does it say? Where is it?
What's it all about, damn it?

960
01:17:11,461 --> 01:17:14,339
Don't keep us in suspense. This has been
a complete fucking nightmare.

961
01:17:14,423 --> 01:17:16,717
Just tell us what the fuck is going on!

962
01:17:18,677 --> 01:17:22,139
Serge? Serge? Serge!

963
01:17:26,393 --> 01:17:28,270
Bloody hell.
They've strangled the poor slob.

964
01:17:56,256 --> 01:17:57,257
Come on! Let's go!

965
01:18:05,223 --> 01:18:07,392
- What do we do if we catch him?
- I don't know.

966
01:18:07,476 --> 01:18:10,312
He's a homicidal psychopath. Let's stop!

967
01:18:10,395 --> 01:18:12,356
I can't. I can barely steer.

968
01:19:20,215 --> 01:19:23,802
You sick, pathetic creep. I hate you.

969
01:19:36,606 --> 01:19:40,485
"'If this do be me end: farewell!',
cried the wounded piper boy...

970
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:44,698
whilst the muskets cracked
and the yeomen roared 'Hurrah!'

971
01:19:44,781 --> 01:19:45,866
and the ramparts fell.

972
01:19:47,451 --> 01:19:51,121
'Methinks me breathes me last,
me fears!', said he -"

973
01:19:51,204 --> 01:19:53,248
Holy shit! You got him!

974
01:19:53,874 --> 01:19:55,459
Well done, Zero!

975
01:20:06,678 --> 01:20:09,097
Gustave H!
You are a fugitive from justice!

976
01:20:09,181 --> 01:20:13,101
Surrender lawfully and I will personally
vouchsafe your fair treatment.

977
01:20:13,185 --> 01:20:14,728
Do not attempt to flee!

978
01:20:14,811 --> 01:20:16,396
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

979
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:19,399
I'd rather jump off this cliff right now
than go back to fucking prison.

980
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:22,736
We steal that sick maniac's motorcycle,
go fetch Agatha,

981
01:20:22,819 --> 01:20:25,280
take back <i>Boy with Apple</i>
and head for the Maltese Riviera.

982
01:20:25,363 --> 01:20:28,074
Very good. You're so extraordinary, Zero.
Thank you.

983
01:20:28,658 --> 01:20:30,952
A moment of silence
in memoriam of a devoted servant

984
01:20:31,036 --> 01:20:33,580
killed violently
during the conduct of his duties.

985
01:20:36,708 --> 01:20:38,043
Good-bye, Serge.

986
01:20:40,128 --> 01:20:42,881
Okay, let's go.

987
01:20:55,018 --> 01:20:56,728
<i>The war began at midnight.</i>

988
01:20:57,395 --> 01:20:59,439
<i>Pffeifelstad fell by lunch
under heavy shelling,</i>

989
01:20:59,523 --> 01:21:03,151
<i>and ten battalions surged across
the long western border.</i>

990
01:21:03,235 --> 01:21:04,986
<i>High command advanced to Nebelsbad.</i>

991
01:21:17,582 --> 01:21:20,835
Compliments of Herr Mendl,
for the executive staff.

992
01:21:24,089 --> 01:21:27,300
General Stieglitz requests a garden-view
sitting room with an extra rollaway.

993
01:21:27,384 --> 01:21:29,469
Let's put him in the Duke Leopold Suite.

994
01:21:29,553 --> 01:21:31,346
Secretary Woroniecki's office cabled.

995
01:21:31,429 --> 01:21:34,933
He's checking in a day early.
Rooms <i>4</i>01-2-3.

996
01:21:35,016 --> 01:21:38,687
Tell Tactical Logistics we're moving them
to a standard double on the third floor.

997
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:40,564
They'll need more space than that.

998
01:22:03,837 --> 01:22:08,300
The beginning of the end
of the end of the beginning has begun.

999
01:22:08,383 --> 01:22:11,720
A sad finale played off-key
on a broken-down saloon piano

1000
01:22:11,803 --> 01:22:14,139
in the outskirts
of a forgotten ghost town.

1001
01:22:14,556 --> 01:22:16,683
I'd rather not bear witness
to such blasphemy.

1002
01:22:16,766 --> 01:22:17,892
Me neither.

1003
01:22:17,976 --> 01:22:20,395
The Grand Budapest
has become a troops' barracks.

1004
01:22:20,478 --> 01:22:23,064
I shall never cross
its threshold again in my lifetime.

1005
01:22:23,148 --> 01:22:24,774
- Me neither.
- Never again shall I -

1006
01:22:24,858 --> 01:22:27,444
Actually, I think we might be
going in there right now after all.

1007
01:22:29,946 --> 01:22:31,114
Dmitri.

1008
01:22:34,367 --> 01:22:35,785
Agatha.

1009
01:22:45,837 --> 01:22:48,590
Good evening, Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis.
I'm Monsieur Chuck.

1010
01:22:48,673 --> 01:22:52,052
We've booked you and your sisters
into the King Ferdinand Suite.

1011
01:22:52,135 --> 01:22:54,387
Good evening.
General von Shrecker asked me -

1012
01:22:54,471 --> 01:22:57,182
- Who's that?
- I... beg your pardon?

1013
01:22:57,265 --> 01:22:59,559
I think that girl's got my picture.
Excuse me.

1014
01:23:16,743 --> 01:23:18,286
- Six.
- Hold it.

1015
01:23:21,915 --> 01:23:22,957
Six.

1016
01:23:26,002 --> 01:23:27,921
Compliments of Herr Mendl.

1017
01:23:43,937 --> 01:23:45,146
Excuse me.

1018
01:23:45,814 --> 01:23:48,692
Have you seen a pastry girl with a package
in the last minute and a half?

1019
01:23:48,775 --> 01:23:51,403
Yep. She just got on the elevator
with Mr. Desgoffe und Taxis.

1020
01:23:51,486 --> 01:23:53,321
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1021
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:55,615
Uh, I'm sorry. Who are you?

1022
01:23:55,699 --> 01:23:59,077
- Otto, sir, the new lobby boy.
- You haven't been trained properly.

1023
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,246
A lobby boy never provides
information of that kind.

1024
01:24:01,329 --> 01:24:03,456
You're a stone wall. Understood?

1025
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:21,725
Pretty picture.

1026
01:24:22,559 --> 01:24:23,560
Sixth floor.

1027
01:25:07,437 --> 01:25:09,063
Where's <i>Boy with Apple</i>?

1028
01:25:10,190 --> 01:25:12,275
None of your goddamn business!

1029
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:16,738
I'm gonna blast your candy-ass
once and for all right now.

1030
01:25:26,664 --> 01:25:27,749
Drop your weapon!

1031
01:25:50,021 --> 01:25:52,065
- Cease fire! Cease fire!
- Whoa!

1032
01:25:52,148 --> 01:25:53,358
Stop it!

1033
01:25:53,858 --> 01:25:55,193
Who's shooting who?

1034
01:25:55,610 --> 01:25:58,071
That's Gustave H,
the escaped murderer and art thief.

1035
01:25:58,154 --> 01:25:59,447
I've got him cornered.

1036
01:25:59,531 --> 01:26:01,032
That's Dmitri Desgoffe und Taxis.

1037
01:26:01,115 --> 01:26:03,368
He's responsible for the killing
of Deputy Kovacs, Serge X,

1038
01:26:03,451 --> 01:26:05,662
and his club-footed sister,
plus his own mother!

1039
01:26:07,747 --> 01:26:09,582
Nobody move. Everybody's under arrest.

1040
01:26:09,666 --> 01:26:12,669
Who's out the window?

1041
01:26:13,795 --> 01:26:14,963
Agatha.

1042
01:26:22,053 --> 01:26:24,389
310-bis. Hang on! Here I come!

1043
01:26:49,581 --> 01:26:52,083
Something's on the back of the -

1044
01:26:57,589 --> 01:26:59,507
Agatha! Agatha!

1045
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:02,093
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

1046
01:27:04,095 --> 01:27:06,014
- Something's on the back of the picture.
- What?

1047
01:27:19,444 --> 01:27:22,113
<i>She left everything
to Monsieur Gustave, of course.</i>

1048
01:27:24,532 --> 01:27:27,952
<i>- The mansion, known as Schloss Lutz -</i>
- I knew her, intimately.

1049
01:27:28,036 --> 01:27:31,122
<i>... the factories, which produced weapons,
medicine and textiles -</i>

1050
01:27:34,083 --> 01:27:35,710
<i>...an important newspaper syndicate...</i>

1051
01:27:36,961 --> 01:27:39,422
<i>and perhaps you've already deduced,</i>

1052
01:27:39,505 --> 01:27:44,510
<i>this very institution,
the Grand Budapest Hotel.</i>

1053
01:27:45,303 --> 01:27:47,221
<i>He anointed me his successor,</i>

1054
01:27:47,305 --> 01:27:50,308
<i>and as the war continued,
I served my adopted country</i>

1055
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:53,645
<i>from the narrow desk still found
against the wall in the next room.</i>

1056
01:27:54,854 --> 01:27:57,273
<i>He was the same as his disciples:</i>

1057
01:27:57,357 --> 01:28:00,818
<i>insecure, vain, superficial, blond, needy.</i>

1058
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:05,073
<i>- In the end, he was even rich.</i>
- Everyone's going to join me.

1059
01:28:05,156 --> 01:28:08,284
<i>He did not succeed, however,
in growing old.</i>

1060
01:28:08,368 --> 01:28:09,661
Are you ready?

1061
01:28:13,081 --> 01:28:15,083
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together -

1062
01:28:15,166 --> 01:28:17,126
<i>Nor did my darling Agatha.</i>

1063
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:20,964
<i>She and our infant son would be killed
two years later by the Prussian grippe.</i>

1064
01:28:21,047 --> 01:28:22,715
<i>An absurd little disease.</i>

1065
01:28:22,799 --> 01:28:27,971
<i>Today we treat it in a single week,
but in those days, many millions died.</i>

1066
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:33,267
<i>On the 21st day of the occupation,</i>

1067
01:28:33,351 --> 01:28:37,271
<i>the morning the independent state
of Zubrowka officially ceased to exist,</i>

1068
01:28:37,355 --> 01:28:39,691
<i>we traveled with Monsieur Gustave to Lutz.</i>

1069
01:28:39,774 --> 01:28:41,985
In answer to your earlier question,
by the way:

1070
01:28:42,777 --> 01:28:44,070
of course.

1071
01:28:45,238 --> 01:28:48,700
Zero asked me about my humble beginnings
in the hotel trade.

1072
01:28:48,783 --> 01:28:51,411
I was perhaps, for a time,
considered the best lobby boy

1073
01:28:51,494 --> 01:28:53,705
we'd ever had at the Grand Budapest.

1074
01:28:54,122 --> 01:28:55,665
I think I can say that.

1075
01:28:55,748 --> 01:28:57,750
This one finally surpassed me.

1076
01:28:57,834 --> 01:29:00,420
Although, I must say,
he had an exceptional teacher.

1077
01:29:00,962 --> 01:29:02,046
Truly.

1078
01:29:07,385 --> 01:29:10,471
"Whence came these two radiant,
celestial brothers,

1079
01:29:10,555 --> 01:29:12,140
united, for an instant,

1080
01:29:12,223 --> 01:29:15,393
as they crossed the stratosphere
of our starry window?

1081
01:29:16,519 --> 01:29:19,230
One from the East and one from the West."

1082
01:29:19,814 --> 01:29:21,190
Very good.

1083
01:29:21,899 --> 01:29:23,568
Don't flirt with her.

1084
01:29:25,903 --> 01:29:28,072
Why are we stopping
at a barley field again?

1085
01:29:37,206 --> 01:29:39,542
I find these black uniforms very drab.

1086
01:29:44,047 --> 01:29:47,008
Well, hello there, chaps.
We were just talking about you.

1087
01:29:47,467 --> 01:29:51,137
- Documents, please.
- With pleasure, as always.

1088
01:29:55,558 --> 01:29:57,351
You're the first
of the official death squads

1089
01:29:57,435 --> 01:29:59,604
to whom we've been formally introduced.

1090
01:29:59,687 --> 01:30:01,439
How do you do?

1091
01:30:03,441 --> 01:30:05,068
<i>Plus ça change</i>, am I right?

1092
01:30:08,821 --> 01:30:13,034
Uh, that's a migratory visa
with stage three worker status, darling.

1093
01:30:13,117 --> 01:30:14,118
Read this.

1094
01:30:23,544 --> 01:30:26,297
- Come outside.
- Now, stay there.

1095
01:30:28,591 --> 01:30:30,843
I give you my word,
if you lay a finger on this man,

1096
01:30:30,927 --> 01:30:34,639
I'll see you dishonorably discharged,
locked up in the stockade

1097
01:30:34,722 --> 01:30:36,724
and hanged by sundown.

1098
01:30:37,683 --> 01:30:40,645
<i>There are still
faint glimmers of civilization left</i>

1099
01:30:40,728 --> 01:30:44,232
<i>in this barbaric slaughterhouse
that was once known as humanity.</i>

1100
01:30:47,276 --> 01:30:50,905
You filthy, goddamn,
pockmarked, fascist assholes!

1101
01:30:52,031 --> 01:30:53,741
<i>He was one of them.</i>

1102
01:30:54,951 --> 01:30:56,994
<i>What more is there to say?</i>

1103
01:31:04,627 --> 01:31:06,003
What happened in the end?

1104
01:31:07,463 --> 01:31:09,090
In the end, they shot him.

1105
01:31:11,217 --> 01:31:12,844
So it all went to me.

1106
01:31:22,061 --> 01:31:25,314
<i>After dinner,
we went to collect the keys to our rooms,</i>

1107
01:31:25,398 --> 01:31:27,608
<i>but Monsieur Jean had abandoned his post.</i>

1108
01:31:27,692 --> 01:31:29,777
I expect he's forgotten all about us.

1109
01:31:30,194 --> 01:31:31,571
<i>In recent years, of course,</i>

1110
01:31:31,654 --> 01:31:33,823
<i>such properties and holdings
as the Grand Budapest</i>

1111
01:31:33,906 --> 01:31:37,493
<i>had, with very few exceptions, become...
common property.</i>

1112
01:31:38,327 --> 01:31:41,122
<i>While the precise terms of his negotiation
with the new government</i>

1113
01:31:41,205 --> 01:31:43,833
<i>had never been announced,
the result was an open secret:</i>

1114
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:47,628
<i>Zero Moustafa had traded
a great and important fortune</i>

1115
01:31:47,712 --> 01:31:52,008
<i>in exchange for one costly,
unprofitable, doomed hotel.</i>

1116
01:31:53,134 --> 01:31:56,304
<i>Why? Was it merely sentimental?</i>

1117
01:31:57,180 --> 01:32:00,391
<i>It was quite forward of me
and a bit out of character,</i>

1118
01:32:00,474 --> 01:32:04,353
<i>but I felt I must know...
for my health, I suppose.</i>

1119
01:32:07,148 --> 01:32:09,483
Forgive me for asking.
I hope I haven't upset you.

1120
01:32:09,567 --> 01:32:11,110
No, of course not.

1121
01:32:12,612 --> 01:32:15,698
Is it simply your last connection
to that vanished world -

1122
01:32:15,781 --> 01:32:17,658
his world, if you will?

1123
01:32:18,201 --> 01:32:19,535
His world?

1124
01:32:20,119 --> 01:32:22,496
No, I don't think so.

1125
01:32:23,289 --> 01:32:27,335
You see, we shared a vocation.
It wouldn't have been necessary.

1126
01:32:28,127 --> 01:32:32,215
No. The hotel I keep for Agatha.

1127
01:32:33,716 --> 01:32:34,967
We were happy here.

1128
01:32:35,885 --> 01:32:37,220
For a little while.

1129
01:32:42,558 --> 01:32:44,977
To be frank,
I think his world had vanished

1130
01:32:45,061 --> 01:32:46,896
long before he ever entered it.

1131
01:32:47,438 --> 01:32:48,689
But I will say:

1132
01:32:48,773 --> 01:32:52,443
he certainly sustained the illusion
with a marvelous grace.

1133
01:32:53,986 --> 01:32:56,197
- Are you going up?
- No, I'll sit for a little while.

1134
01:32:57,031 --> 01:32:58,449
Good night.

1135
01:33:03,788 --> 01:33:07,250
<i>The next week,
I sailed for a cure in South America</i>

1136
01:33:07,333 --> 01:33:10,253
<i>and began a long,
wandering journey abroad.</i>

1137
01:33:10,336 --> 01:33:12,463
<i>I did not return to Europe for many years.</i>

1138
01:33:18,094 --> 01:33:20,554
<i>It was an enchanting old ruin.</i>

1139
01:33:25,810 --> 01:33:28,354
<i>But I never managed
to see it again.</i>
