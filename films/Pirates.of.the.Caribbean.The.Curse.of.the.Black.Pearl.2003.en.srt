00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,490
</i>Drink up, me hearties,
yo ho</i>

2
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,160
</i>We kidnap and ravage
and don't give a hoot</i>

3
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,100
</i>Drink up, me hearties,
yo ho</i>

4
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,610
</i>Yo ho, yo ho</i>

5
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:48,765
</i>A pirate's life for me</i>

6
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:53,603
</i>We extort, we pilfer
We filch, we sack</i>

7
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:56,147
</i>- Drink...</i>
- Quiet, missy!

8
00:00:56,231 --> 00:00:58,608
Cursed pirates sail these waters.

9
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,943
You don't want to bring
them down on us, do ya?

10
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:02,820
Mr Gibbs, that will do.

11
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:05,490
She was singing about pirates!

12
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,658
Bad luck to be singing about pirates

13
00:01:07,743 --> 00:01:10,912
with us mired in this unnatural fog,
mark my words.

14
00:01:10,996 --> 00:01:12,330
Consider them marked.

15
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:16,501
- On your way.
- Aye, Lieutenant.

16
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:18,669
Bad luck to have a woman on board, too.

17
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,963
Even a miniature one.

18
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:24,550
l think it'd be rather exciting
to meet a pirate.

19
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:28,346
Think again, Miss Swann.

20
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,265
Vile and dissolute creatures,
the lot of 'em.

21
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,477
l intend to see to it that any man
who sails under a pirate flag

22
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,146
or wears a pirate brand
gets what he deserves.

23
00:01:38,357 --> 00:01:40,525
A short drop and a sudden stop.

24
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,198
Lieutenant Norrington,
l appreciate your fervour,

25
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:51,869
but l'm concerned about the effect
this subject will have upon my daughter.

26
00:01:51,954 --> 00:01:53,746
My apologies, Governor Swann.

27
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:56,040
Actually, l find it all fascinating.

28
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:57,875
Yes. That's what concerns me.

29
00:02:26,155 --> 00:02:27,155
Look! A boy!

30
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:28,573
There's a boy in the water!

31
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:32,368
Man overboard!

32
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:35,955
Man the ropes!
Fetch a hook!

33
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,124
Haul him aboard!

34
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:48,593
He's still breathing.

35
00:02:48,677 --> 00:02:50,928
Mary, Mother of God!

36
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,936
What happened here?

37
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:04,150
Most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

38
00:03:06,612 --> 00:03:07,820
Lot of good it did them.

39
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:10,448
Everyone's thinking it,
l'm just saying it.

40
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,533
Pirates!

41
00:03:12,618 --> 00:03:15,453
There's no proof of that!

42
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,038
lt was probably an accident.

43
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:20,416
Rouse the captain immediately.

44
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,376
- Aye, sir.
- Heave to and take in sail.

45
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:24,128
- Lower the boats.
- Heave to!

46
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:28,633
Elizabeth, l want you
to accompany the boy.

47
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:31,135
He'll be in your charge.

48
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:32,845
Take care of him.

49
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:53,824
lt's OK.

50
00:03:54,952 --> 00:03:56,661
My name's Elizabeth Swann.

51
00:03:57,996 --> 00:03:59,413
Will Turner.

52
00:04:00,415 --> 00:04:02,333
l'm watching over you, Will.

53
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:16,847
You're a pirate!

54
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:19,100
Has he said anything?

55
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:20,768
His name's William Turner.

56
00:04:20,852 --> 00:04:22,353
That's all l found out.

57
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,397
Take him below.

58
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,093
Elizabeth!

59
00:05:38,597 --> 00:05:39,764
Are you all right?

60
00:05:41,183 --> 00:05:42,308
Are you decent?

61
00:05:42,934 --> 00:05:43,934
Yes.

62
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:44,977
Yes?

63
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,938
Still abed at this hour?

64
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,442
lt's a beautiful day.

65
00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:55,363
l have a gift for you.

66
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,285
- Oh, it's beautiful!
- lsn't it?

67
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:04,914
May l inquire as to the occasion?

68
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:08,042
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

69
00:06:09,961 --> 00:06:11,003
Go on.

70
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:15,966
Actually, l...

71
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:20,262
l had hoped you might wear it
for the ceremony today.

72
00:06:20,305 --> 00:06:21,597
Ceremony?

73
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,058
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.

74
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:25,309
l knew it!

75
00:06:25,394 --> 00:06:28,687
Commodore Norrington,
as he's about to become.

76
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:30,689
A fine gentleman, don't you think?

77
00:06:31,483 --> 00:06:32,983
He fancies you, you know.

78
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:35,069
Elizabeth?

79
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:36,821
How's it coming?

80
00:06:36,905 --> 00:06:38,656
lt's difficult to say.

81
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,826
l'm told it's the
latest fashion in London.

82
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,244
Well, women in London

83
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:44,995
must've learned not to breathe!

84
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:48,833
My Lord, you have a visitor.

85
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:08,352
Mr Turner.

86
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:09,854
Good to see you again.

87
00:07:09,938 --> 00:07:11,063
Good day, sir.

88
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:13,858
l have your order.

89
00:07:19,364 --> 00:07:20,531
Well...

90
00:07:20,615 --> 00:07:22,366
The blade is folded steel.

91
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:25,453
That's gold filigree
laid into the handle.

92
00:07:26,163 --> 00:07:27,413
lf l may?

93
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,041
Perfectly balanced.

94
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:34,128
The tang is nearly
the full width of the blade.

95
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:39,216
lmpressive. Very impressive.

96
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,593
Very nice.

97
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:44,263
Commodore Norrington's going
to be very pleased with this.

98
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,892
Do pass my compliments
onto your master.

99
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:51,061
l shall.

100
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:55,858
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

101
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,863
Elizabeth! You look absolutely stunning.

102
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:01,906
Will.

103
00:08:03,074 --> 00:08:04,742
lt's so good to see you.

104
00:08:05,994 --> 00:08:07,703
l had a dream about you last night.

105
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:08,829
About me?

106
00:08:08,914 --> 00:08:10,498
ls it entirely proper for you...

107
00:08:10,582 --> 00:08:12,416
About the day we met.
Do you remember?

108
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:15,252
How could l forget, Miss Swann?

109
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,838
How many times must l ask you
to call me Elizabeth?

110
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:20,174
At least once more, Miss Swann.

111
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:22,092
As always.

112
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,427
Now, you see?

113
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,763
At least the boy
has a sense of propriety.

114
00:08:25,847 --> 00:08:27,097
We really must be going.

115
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,140
Come on.

116
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:30,768
Good day, Mr Turner.

117
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:33,354
Come along!

118
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:37,942
Good day...

119
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:42,279
...Elizabeth.

120
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:14,663
Hold up there, you!

121
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,668
lt's a shilling to tie up
your boat to the dock.

122
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:23,380
And l shall need to know your name.

123
00:10:26,051 --> 00:10:28,344
What do you say to three shillings,

124
00:10:28,386 --> 00:10:29,637
and we forget the name?

125
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,309
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr Smith.

126
00:11:11,763 --> 00:11:13,597
Two paces... march!

127
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,143
Right about... face!

128
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:23,440
Present... arms!

129
00:11:47,716 --> 00:11:50,467
This dock is off limits to civilians.

130
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:52,302
l'm terribly sorry, l didn't know.

131
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:55,055
lf l see one,
l shall inform you immediately.

132
00:11:58,643 --> 00:12:02,271
Apparently, there's some high-toned
and fancy to-do up at the fort, eh?

133
00:12:02,313 --> 00:12:05,482
How could it be two upstanding
gentlemen, such as yourselves,

134
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,526
did not merit an invitation?

135
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,779
Someone has to make sure this dock
stays off limit to civilians.

136
00:12:10,822 --> 00:12:13,198
lt's a fine goal, to be sure.

137
00:12:13,283 --> 00:12:15,242
But it seems to me, a...

138
00:12:15,326 --> 00:12:17,077
...a ship like that...

139
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:20,164
makes this one here
a bit superfluous, really.

140
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,333
Oh, the Dauntless is the power
in these waters, true enough,

141
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:27,337
but there's no ship that can match
the Interceptor for speed.

142
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,464
l've heard of one.

143
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:31,175
lt's supposed to be very fast,
nigh uncatchable.

144
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:33,010
The Black Pearl.

145
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,055
There's no real ship

146
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,807
that can match the Interceptor.

147
00:12:40,477 --> 00:12:42,519
The Black Pearl is a real ship.

148
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,188
No, it's not.

149
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,564
Yes, it is. l've seen it!

150
00:12:46,316 --> 00:12:47,399
You've seen it?

151
00:12:47,484 --> 00:12:48,525
Yes.

152
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,527
You haven't seen it!

153
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,653
Yes, l have!

154
00:12:51,696 --> 00:12:53,155
You've seen a ship

155
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:55,199
with black sails,

156
00:12:55,283 --> 00:12:56,950
that's crewed by the damned,

157
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:59,536
and captained by a man so evil

158
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,206
that hell itself spat him back out?

159
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:05,250
No.

160
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:08,420
But l have seen a ship with black sails.

161
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:11,381
And no ship that's
not crewed by the damned,

162
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:14,343
and captained by a man so evil
that hell itself spat him back out

163
00:13:14,385 --> 00:13:16,053
could possibly have black sails,

164
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:18,222
therefore couldn't possibly
be any other ship

165
00:13:18,306 --> 00:13:21,725
than the Black Pearl,
is that what you're saying?

166
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:22,893
No.

167
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,228
Like l said,

168
00:13:24,312 --> 00:13:27,523
there's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor...

169
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:30,984
Hey!

170
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,445
You!

171
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:35,614
Get away from there!

172
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:38,075
You don't have permission
to be aboard there, mate.

173
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,827
Sorry. lt's such a pretty boat.

174
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:40,911
Ship!

175
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:42,663
What's your name?

176
00:13:42,747 --> 00:13:43,747
Smith!

177
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,541
Or Smithy, if you like.

178
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,877
What's your purpose in Port Royal,
Mr Smith?

179
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,920
Yeah, and no lies!

180
00:13:50,004 --> 00:13:51,463
All right then.

181
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:52,548
l confess.

182
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:56,260
lt is my intention to commandeer
one of these ships, pick up a crew

183
00:13:56,344 --> 00:13:59,763
in Tortuga, raid, pillage, plunder and 
otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out.

184
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:01,723
l said, no lies!

185
00:14:01,766 --> 00:14:03,684
l think he's telling the truth.

186
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:05,310
lf he were telling the truth,

187
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:06,645
he wouldn't have told us.

188
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:11,149
Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't 
believe the truth, even if he told it to you.

189
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,245
May l have a moment?

190
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:33,964
You look lovely, Elizabeth.

191
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,799
Yes.

192
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:39,553
l apologise if l seem forward,

193
00:14:39,637 --> 00:14:41,722
but l must speak my mind.

194
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:47,603
This promotion throws into sharp relief

195
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:50,606
that which l have not yet achieved.

196
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:54,818
A marriage to a fine woman.

197
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,031
You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.

198
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:00,991
l can't breathe.

199
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:02,868
Yes, l...

200
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:04,453
l'm a bit nervous myself.

201
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:09,041
And then they made me their chief.

202
00:15:12,003 --> 00:15:13,045
Elizabeth?

203
00:15:15,757 --> 00:15:16,757
Elizabeth!

204
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,720
The rocks!
Sir, it's a miracle she missed them!

205
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,516
- Will you be saving her, then?
- l can't swim!

206
00:15:28,686 --> 00:15:30,687
Pearl of the King's Navy, you are!

207
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,439
Do not lose these!

208
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:48,121
What was that?

209
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:31,957
l got her!

210
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:34,501
She's not breathing!

211
00:16:34,585 --> 00:16:35,585
Move!

212
00:16:42,677 --> 00:16:44,428
l never would've thought of that.

213
00:16:44,512 --> 00:16:46,763
Clearly you've never been to Singapore.

214
00:16:52,353 --> 00:16:53,979
Where did you get that?

215
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,607
On your feet.

216
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:01,028
Elizabeth!

217
00:17:02,363 --> 00:17:04,364
- Are you all right?
- Yes, l'm fine.

218
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,913
- Shoot him!
- Father! Commodore...

219
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:13,999
...do you intend to kill my rescuer?

220
00:17:21,382 --> 00:17:23,175
l believe thanks are in order.

221
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:30,640
Had a brush with the East lndia
Trading Company, did we?

222
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:31,975
Pirate?

223
00:17:33,227 --> 00:17:34,519
Hang him.

224
00:17:34,604 --> 00:17:37,355
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

225
00:17:38,608 --> 00:17:39,941
Well, well.

226
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:42,486
Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

227
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,197
Captain Jack Sparrow,
if you please, sir.

228
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:47,157
Well, l don't see your ship...

229
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,408
...captain.

230
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:50,827
l'm in the market, as it were.

231
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,871
He said he'd come to commandeer one.

232
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:55,749
l told you he was telling the truth.
These are his, sir.

233
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:02,339
No additional shots nor powder.

234
00:18:04,175 --> 00:18:06,009
A compass that doesn't point north.

235
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:13,683
And l half expected it
to be made of wood.

236
00:18:16,187 --> 00:18:19,106
You are, without doubt,
the worst pirate l've heard of.

237
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:21,525
But you have heard of me.

238
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:26,488
Commodore, l really must protest!

239
00:18:27,198 --> 00:18:28,698
Carefully, lieutenant.

240
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,034
Pirate or not, this man saved my life!

241
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:34,663
One good deed is not enough to redeem
a man of a lifetime of wickedness!

242
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:36,456
Though it seems enough to condemn him.

243
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,874
lndeed.

244
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,794
Finally.

245
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,547
Wait, don't shoot!

246
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:44,923
l knew you'd warm up to me.

247
00:18:45,007 --> 00:18:47,801
Commodore Norrington,
my effects, please.

248
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:49,553
And my hat.

249
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:51,513
Commodore.

250
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:57,435
- Elizabeth. lt is Elizabeth, isn't it?
- lt's Miss Swann.

251
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,063
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.

252
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,732
Come, dear, we don't have all day.

253
00:19:04,068 --> 00:19:05,485
Now, if you'll be very kind.

254
00:19:22,503 --> 00:19:23,920
Easy on the goods, darling.

255
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:26,798
You're despicable.

256
00:19:26,883 --> 00:19:28,884
Sticks and stones, love.

257
00:19:28,926 --> 00:19:30,510
l saved your life, you save mine.

258
00:19:30,595 --> 00:19:31,595
We're square.

259
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:33,805
Gentlemen...

260
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,348
...my lady...

261
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:38,768
...you will always remember this
as the day you almost caught...

262
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:41,271
...Captain Jack Sparrow!

263
00:19:59,874 --> 00:20:01,333
Now, will you shoot him?

264
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,084
Open fire!

265
00:20:10,384 --> 00:20:11,801
Burn his heels!

266
00:20:27,235 --> 00:20:29,236
Take cover, men!

267
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,238
Gillette...

268
00:20:31,322 --> 00:20:34,157
...Mr Sparrow has a dawn
appointment with the gallows.

269
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,534
l would hate for him to miss it.

270
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,957
Search upstairs!

271
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:44,501
Look lively, men!

272
00:22:17,762 --> 00:22:19,888
Right where l left you.

273
00:22:26,437 --> 00:22:28,271
Not where l left you.

274
00:22:38,866 --> 00:22:40,700
You're the one they're hunting.

275
00:22:41,702 --> 00:22:42,869
The pirate!

276
00:22:43,621 --> 00:22:46,748
You seem somewhat familiar.
Have l threatened you before?

277
00:22:46,791 --> 00:22:49,542
l make a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates.

278
00:22:50,628 --> 00:22:53,296
lt would be a shame to put
a black mark on your record.

279
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:54,881
So if you'll excuse me...

280
00:22:58,386 --> 00:23:00,553
Do you think this wise, boy?

281
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:04,682
Crossing blades with a pirate?

282
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:06,142
You threatened Miss Swann.

283
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,522
Only a little.

284
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,288
You know what you're doing,
l'll give you that. Excellent form.

285
00:23:28,165 --> 00:23:29,874
But how's your footwork?

286
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:32,043
lf l step here...

287
00:23:33,421 --> 00:23:34,838
Very good.

288
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,965
And now l step again.

289
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,012
Ta.

290
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:04,576
That is a wonderful trick.

291
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,539
Except, once again,
you are between me and my way out.

292
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:10,748
And now...

293
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:12,792
...you have no weapon.

294
00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:36,774
Who makes all these?

295
00:24:38,235 --> 00:24:39,569
l do.

296
00:24:39,653 --> 00:24:41,905
And l practice with them...

297
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:43,573
...three hours a day.

298
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:47,577
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.

299
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:57,212
Or... perhaps the reason
you practice three hours a day

300
00:24:57,254 --> 00:24:59,088
is that you already found one,

301
00:24:59,173 --> 00:25:02,759
and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

302
00:25:02,843 --> 00:25:05,303
You're not a eunuch, are you?

303
00:25:05,387 --> 00:25:08,306
l practice three hours a day
so that when l meet a pirate,

304
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,766
l can kill it!

305
00:26:27,136 --> 00:26:28,136
You cheated.

306
00:26:28,178 --> 00:26:29,470
Pirate.

307
00:26:33,017 --> 00:26:35,018
- Move away!
- No.

308
00:26:35,102 --> 00:26:36,436
Please move?

309
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,520
No!

310
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:40,356
l cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

311
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:44,902
This shot is not meant for you.

312
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:57,248
There he is! Over here!

313
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,210
Excellent work, Mr Brown.

314
00:27:02,212 --> 00:27:05,089
You've assisted in the capture
of a dangerous fugitive.

315
00:27:05,174 --> 00:27:07,467
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

316
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:11,054
l trust you will always remember
that this is the day

317
00:27:11,138 --> 00:27:14,557
Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.

318
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,351
Take him away.

319
00:27:21,482 --> 00:27:23,566
- Come here, boy!
- Smell it?

320
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:26,694
- Come here, boy!
- You want a nice, juicy bone?

321
00:27:26,737 --> 00:27:29,155
- Hey!
- Come here, boy!

322
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:31,741
- Come here, boy!
- You can keep doing that forever.

323
00:27:31,825 --> 00:27:34,035
The dog is never going to move.

324
00:27:34,078 --> 00:27:38,373
Well, excuse us if we haven't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet!

325
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:40,833
Come on!

326
00:27:45,089 --> 00:27:46,381
There you go, miss.

327
00:27:46,423 --> 00:27:49,217
lt was a difficult day for you,
l'm sure.

328
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:51,928
l suspected Commodore Norrington
would propose,

329
00:27:52,012 --> 00:27:54,597
but l must admit,
l wasn't entirely prepared for it.

330
00:27:54,682 --> 00:27:56,933
l meant you being
threatened by that pirate!

331
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,226
Sounds terrifying!

332
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:01,729
Oh... Yes, it was terrifying.

333
00:28:01,772 --> 00:28:03,773
But... the Commodore proposed!

334
00:28:03,857 --> 00:28:05,441
Fancy that.

335
00:28:05,526 --> 00:28:07,110
Now that's a smart match, miss,

336
00:28:07,194 --> 00:28:09,320
if it's not too bold to say.

337
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:10,780
lt is a smart match.

338
00:28:11,949 --> 00:28:13,741
He's a fine man.

339
00:28:15,035 --> 00:28:17,537
He's what any woman
should dream of marrying.

340
00:28:18,622 --> 00:28:20,748
Well, that Will Turner,

341
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:22,959
he's a fine man, too.

342
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,794
That is too bold.

343
00:28:24,878 --> 00:28:26,963
Well, beggin' your pardon, miss.

344
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,673
lt was not my place.

345
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:20,725
Has my daughter given
you an answer yet?

346
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:22,518
No, she hasn't.

347
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:24,896
Well, she has had a very trying day.

348
00:29:26,565 --> 00:29:28,733
Ghastly weather, don't you think?

349
00:29:28,817 --> 00:29:30,693
Bleak. Really bleak.

350
00:29:32,488 --> 00:29:33,488
What's that?

351
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,449
Cannon fire!

352
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:39,702
Return fire!

353
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:41,496
l know those guns!

354
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,754
lt's the Pearl!

355
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:51,547
Black Pearl?

356
00:29:54,051 --> 00:29:55,676
l've heard stories.

357
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:59,722
She's been preying on ships and
settlements for near ten years.

358
00:29:59,807 --> 00:30:01,390
Never leaves any survivors.

359
00:30:01,475 --> 00:30:02,892
No survivors.

360
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:05,770
Then where do the stories
come from, l wonder?

361
00:30:15,072 --> 00:30:16,823
Clear the dock!

362
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,960
Mama!

363
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:40,263
On your oars!

364
00:31:38,488 --> 00:31:40,072
Sight the muzzle flash.

365
00:31:40,157 --> 00:31:41,157
Aim for the flashes.

366
00:31:41,241 --> 00:31:43,326
l need a full spread, fore and aft.

367
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,036
Mr Stevens, more cartridges!

368
00:31:45,913 --> 00:31:49,040
Governor!
Barricade yourself in my office.

369
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Good God!

370
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:52,668
That's an order.

371
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:11,896
Don't!

372
00:32:12,689 --> 00:32:13,856
Hello, chum.

373
00:32:18,111 --> 00:32:19,654
Up there! Go!

374
00:32:29,456 --> 00:32:32,124
Miss Swann! They've come to kidnap you!

375
00:32:32,209 --> 00:32:34,794
- What?
- You're the governor's daughter!

376
00:32:34,878 --> 00:32:36,045
ln here!

377
00:32:37,714 --> 00:32:41,968
They haven't seen you. Hide, and the
first chance you get, run to the fort!

378
00:32:51,478 --> 00:32:53,104
Got ya! Haven't l?

379
00:32:58,527 --> 00:33:00,152
No! No! lt's hot!

380
00:33:00,237 --> 00:33:02,071
- l'm burning!
- Come on!

381
00:33:06,535 --> 00:33:07,868
Come on, me lads!

382
00:33:34,604 --> 00:33:36,439
Come out!

383
00:33:46,033 --> 00:33:48,868
We know you're here, poppet.

384
00:33:49,953 --> 00:33:51,120
Poppet.

385
00:33:51,204 --> 00:33:52,246
Come out...

386
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:55,374
...and we promise we won't hurt you.

387
00:33:55,459 --> 00:33:56,709
Eh?

388
00:33:58,462 --> 00:34:00,463
We will find you, poppet.

389
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,924
You've got something of ours,

390
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:05,760
and it calls to us.

391
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:13,976
The gold calls to us.

392
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,187
The gold.

393
00:34:22,319 --> 00:34:24,361
Hello, poppet.

394
00:34:24,905 --> 00:34:25,905
Parley!

395
00:34:26,615 --> 00:34:27,823
What?

396
00:34:27,866 --> 00:34:29,033
Parley.

397
00:34:29,117 --> 00:34:30,534
l invoke the right of parley.

398
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:34,538
According to the code of brethren, set
down by pirates Morgan and Bartholomew,

399
00:34:34,623 --> 00:34:37,708
- you have to take me to your captain.
- l know the code.

400
00:34:37,793 --> 00:34:40,503
lf an adversary demands parley,
you can do them no harm

401
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:43,339
- until the parley is complete.
- To blazes with the code!

402
00:34:43,423 --> 00:34:45,382
She wants to be taken to the captain.

403
00:34:46,885 --> 00:34:49,178
And she'll go, without a fuss.

404
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:53,265
We must honour the code.

405
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:05,277
Say goodbye!

406
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:11,242
Goodbye.

407
00:35:15,372 --> 00:35:17,164
- Come on!
- Elizabeth!

408
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:19,792
Well!

409
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,175
Out of my way, scum!

410
00:35:40,814 --> 00:35:43,691
My sympathies, friend.
You've no manner of luck at all.

411
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:07,590
Come on, doggy!

412
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:09,508
lt's just you and me now.

413
00:36:09,593 --> 00:36:11,969
lt's you and old Jack.
Come on.

414
00:36:12,053 --> 00:36:13,762
Come on. That's a boy!

415
00:36:13,805 --> 00:36:15,973
Good boy. Come get your bone!

416
00:36:16,057 --> 00:36:18,851
That's a good boy.
Come on, a bit closer, a bit closer.

417
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,062
That's it! That's it, doggy!

418
00:36:22,105 --> 00:36:26,108
Come on, you filthy,
slimy, mangy cur!

419
00:36:26,776 --> 00:36:28,444
Don't do that. No, no, no!

420
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,154
l didn't mean it! l didn't...

421
00:36:37,037 --> 00:36:38,579
This ain't the armoury!

422
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,498
Well, well, well.

423
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:44,460
Look what we have here, Twigg.

424
00:36:44,544 --> 00:36:46,629
Captain Jack Sparrow.

425
00:36:47,797 --> 00:36:49,965
Last time l saw you,

426
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:51,800
you were all alone

427
00:36:51,885 --> 00:36:54,637
on a godforsaken island,

428
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,889
shrinking into the distance.

429
00:36:56,973 --> 00:36:59,475
His fortunes aren't improved much.

430
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:02,978
Worry about your own fortunes,
gentlemen.

431
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:06,065
The deepest circle of hell
is reserved for betrayers

432
00:37:06,149 --> 00:37:07,691
and mutineers.

433
00:37:11,821 --> 00:37:13,322
So there is a curse.

434
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,408
That's interesting.

435
00:37:16,493 --> 00:37:18,744
You know nothing of hell.

436
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,421
That's very interesting.

437
00:38:04,874 --> 00:38:07,418
l didn't know we was takin' on captives.

438
00:38:07,502 --> 00:38:10,546
She's invoked the right of parley
with Captain Barbossa.

439
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:14,466
- l am here to negotia...
- You will speak when spoken to!

440
00:38:15,468 --> 00:38:17,553
And ye will not lay a hand on those

441
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:20,014
under the protection of parley.

442
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,807
Aye, sir.

443
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:26,437
My apologies, miss.

444
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:28,856
Captain Barbossa,

445
00:38:28,898 --> 00:38:33,319
l am here to negotiate the cessation
of hostilities against Port Royal.

446
00:38:34,404 --> 00:38:38,449
A lot of long words in there, miss.
We are not but humble pirates.

447
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:41,118
What is it that you want?

448
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:43,329
l want you to leave and never come back.

449
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:48,584
l'm disinclined
to acquiesce to your request.

450
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,504
Means "no."

451
00:38:53,923 --> 00:38:54,923
Very well.

452
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,595
l'll drop it.

453
00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:07,811
Me holds are burstin' with swag!
That bit of shine matters to us?

454
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:09,313
Why?

455
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,733
lt's what you've been searching for.

456
00:39:12,776 --> 00:39:14,443
l recognise the ship.

457
00:39:14,527 --> 00:39:17,404
l saw it eight years ago
on the crossing from England!

458
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:18,614
Did you now?

459
00:39:21,618 --> 00:39:22,618
Fine.

460
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,204
l suppose if it is worthless,

461
00:39:25,288 --> 00:39:27,331
then there's no point in me keeping it.

462
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:28,457
No!

463
00:39:39,386 --> 00:39:41,470
You have a name, missy?

464
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:43,639
Elizabeth...

465
00:39:43,723 --> 00:39:45,057
...Turner.

466
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:48,268
l'm a maid in the governor's household.

467
00:39:51,564 --> 00:39:52,981
Miss Turner!

468
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:55,442
Turner!

469
00:39:55,485 --> 00:39:56,902
Bootstrap!

470
00:40:00,949 --> 00:40:03,617
And how does a maid come
to own a trinket such as that?

471
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,286
Family heirloom, perhaps?

472
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:08,831
l didn't steal it,
if that's what you mean.

473
00:40:10,417 --> 00:40:13,502
Very well. You hand it over,
we'll put your town to our rudder,

474
00:40:13,586 --> 00:40:14,795
and ne'er return.

475
00:40:28,518 --> 00:40:29,518
Our bargain?

476
00:40:32,522 --> 00:40:34,356
Still the guns and stow 'em.

477
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:37,234
Signal the men, set the flags
and make good to clear port.

478
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:39,027
Wait! You have to take me to shore.

479
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,697
According to the code of
the order of the brethren...

480
00:40:41,781 --> 00:40:45,451
First, your return to shore was not part 
of our negotiation nor our agreements,

481
00:40:45,535 --> 00:40:46,702
so l must do nothin'.

482
00:40:46,786 --> 00:40:49,872
Secondly, you must be a pirate
for the pirate's code to apply,

483
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:51,540
and you're not, and thirdly...

484
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:54,334
...the code is more of what
you'd call a guideline,

485
00:40:54,377 --> 00:40:55,878
instead of actual rules.

486
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,338
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,

487
00:40:58,381 --> 00:40:59,882
Miss Turner.

488
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:22,988
They've taken her!
They've taken Elizabeth!

489
00:41:23,072 --> 00:41:25,157
Mr Murtogg, remove this man.

490
00:41:26,242 --> 00:41:28,327
We have to hunt them down!
We must save her!

491
00:41:28,411 --> 00:41:30,454
And where do you propose we start?

492
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:35,375
lf you have any information concerning
my daughter, please share it.

493
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,421
That Jack Sparrow!

494
00:41:39,506 --> 00:41:41,757
He talked about the Black Pearl.

495
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,717
Mentioned it is more what he did.

496
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:48,430
Ask him where it is! Make a deal
with him, he could lead us to it.

497
00:41:48,473 --> 00:41:49,973
No.

498
00:41:50,058 --> 00:41:53,352
The pirates who invaded this fort
left Sparrow locked in his cell,

499
00:41:53,436 --> 00:41:56,438
ergo they are not his allies.

500
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:59,483
Governor, we will establish
their most likely course...

501
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:01,443
That's not good enough!

502
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:03,445
Mr Turner...

503
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:07,032
...you are not a military man,
you are not a sailor.

504
00:42:08,076 --> 00:42:09,451
You are a blacksmith.

505
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:12,329
And this is not the moment
for rash actions!

506
00:42:14,624 --> 00:42:17,626
Do not make the mistake of thinking
you are the only man here

507
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,211
who cares for Elizabeth.

508
00:42:25,218 --> 00:42:26,426
Please...

509
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:32,558
You! Sparrow!

510
00:42:32,642 --> 00:42:33,642
Aye?

511
00:42:33,685 --> 00:42:36,311
You are familiar with that ship,
the Black Pearl?

512
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:37,729
l've heard of it.

513
00:42:37,814 --> 00:42:40,482
Where does it make berth?

514
00:42:41,484 --> 00:42:43,443
Have you not heard the stories?

515
00:42:45,154 --> 00:42:47,114
Captain Barbossa

516
00:42:47,156 --> 00:42:48,907
and his crew of miscreants

517
00:42:48,992 --> 00:42:51,577
sail from the dreaded lsla de Muerte.

518
00:42:51,661 --> 00:42:54,454
lt's an island that
cannot be found, except

519
00:42:54,497 --> 00:42:57,583
by those who already know where it is.

520
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:59,334
The ship's real enough,

521
00:42:59,377 --> 00:43:02,838
therefore its anchorage must be
a real place. Where is it?

522
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,007
Why ask me?

523
00:43:05,675 --> 00:43:07,259
Because you're a pirate.

524
00:43:07,343 --> 00:43:10,012
And you want to turn pirate yourself.
ls that it?

525
00:43:11,264 --> 00:43:12,264
Never!

526
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:17,686
They took Miss Swann.

527
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:19,563
So it is that you found a girl!

528
00:43:19,647 --> 00:43:21,440
l see.

529
00:43:21,524 --> 00:43:24,276
lf you're intending to brave all,
hasten to her rescue,

530
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,320
and so, win fair lady's heart...

531
00:43:26,362 --> 00:43:28,989
...you'll have to do it alone, mate.

532
00:43:29,032 --> 00:43:31,116
l see no profit in it for me.

533
00:43:32,201 --> 00:43:33,452
l can get you out of here.

534
00:43:33,536 --> 00:43:35,203
How's that? The key's run off.

535
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:36,872
l helped build these cells.

536
00:43:36,956 --> 00:43:39,708
These are half-pin barrel hinges.

537
00:43:41,002 --> 00:43:44,296
With the right leverage,
and the proper application of strength,

538
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:46,840
the door will lift free.

539
00:43:49,218 --> 00:43:50,469
What's your name?

540
00:43:50,553 --> 00:43:52,471
Will Turner.

541
00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:56,099
That would be short for William,
l imagine.

542
00:43:56,184 --> 00:43:57,351
Good, strong name.

543
00:43:58,353 --> 00:44:00,270
No doubt named for your father?

544
00:44:02,023 --> 00:44:03,023
Yes.

545
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,194
Well, Mr Turner,

546
00:44:07,236 --> 00:44:08,445
l've changed me mind.

547
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:12,115
lf you spring me from this cell,
l swear, on pain of death,

548
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,409
l shall take you to the Black Pearl,

549
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:16,119
and your bonny lass.

550
00:44:16,204 --> 00:44:18,205
Do we have an accord?

551
00:44:21,709 --> 00:44:23,543
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

552
00:44:23,586 --> 00:44:24,753
Get me out.

553
00:44:28,257 --> 00:44:32,052
- Hurry! Someone will have heard that.
- Not without my effects.

554
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:40,143
We're going to steal the ship?

555
00:44:41,938 --> 00:44:42,938
That ship?

556
00:44:43,022 --> 00:44:44,856
Commandeer.

557
00:44:44,941 --> 00:44:47,192
We're going to commandeer that ship.

558
00:44:47,276 --> 00:44:48,360
Nautical term.

559
00:44:49,028 --> 00:44:51,113
One question about your business, boy,

560
00:44:51,197 --> 00:44:52,614
or there's no use going.

561
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:54,199
This girl...

562
00:44:54,283 --> 00:44:56,993
...how far are you willing to go
to save her?

563
00:44:57,078 --> 00:44:58,412
l'd die for her.

564
00:44:58,454 --> 00:44:59,663
Oh, good.

565
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:01,748
No worries then.

566
00:45:20,768 --> 00:45:23,311
This is either madness or brilliance.

567
00:45:24,105 --> 00:45:27,733
lt's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

568
00:45:57,388 --> 00:46:01,183
Everyone stay calm!
We're taking over the ship.

569
00:46:01,267 --> 00:46:02,976
Aye! Avast!

570
00:46:06,189 --> 00:46:08,523
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.

571
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,193
You'll never make it out of the bay.

572
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:12,861
Son...

573
00:46:13,905 --> 00:46:16,740
...l'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

574
00:46:16,824 --> 00:46:18,366
Savvy?

575
00:46:21,871 --> 00:46:22,913
Commodore!

576
00:46:22,997 --> 00:46:25,207
Sir! They're taking the Dauntless!

577
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:28,293
Commodore!

578
00:46:28,377 --> 00:46:30,712
They're taking the ship!

579
00:46:31,464 --> 00:46:34,090
Sparrow and Turner!
They're taking the Dauntless!

580
00:46:34,175 --> 00:46:35,509
Rash, Turner.

581
00:46:35,551 --> 00:46:37,219
Too rash.

582
00:46:38,763 --> 00:46:42,974
He is, without doubt,
the worst pirate l have ever seen.

583
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,562
Here they come.

584
00:46:52,401 --> 00:46:54,653
Bring her around!
Bring her around!

585
00:47:01,202 --> 00:47:04,371
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges.

586
00:47:20,388 --> 00:47:23,265
Sailors, back to the Interceptor!
Now!

587
00:47:29,272 --> 00:47:33,191
Thank you, Commodore,
for getting us ready to make way.

588
00:47:33,276 --> 00:47:35,861
We'd have had a hard time
of it by ourselves.

589
00:47:39,115 --> 00:47:41,157
Set topsails and clear up this mess.

590
00:47:41,242 --> 00:47:43,785
With the wind a quarter astern,
we won't catch them!

591
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:46,788
l don't need to catch them. Just 
get them in range of the long nines.

592
00:47:46,873 --> 00:47:48,957
Hands, come about! Run out the guns!

593
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,375
Bring out the guns!

594
00:47:50,459 --> 00:47:53,044
We are to fire on our own ship, sir?

595
00:47:53,129 --> 00:47:56,965
l'd rather see her at the bottom of the
ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

596
00:47:58,259 --> 00:47:59,467
Commodore!

597
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:01,595
He's disabled the rudder chain, sir.

598
00:48:05,308 --> 00:48:06,975
Abandon ship!

599
00:48:13,649 --> 00:48:16,109
That's got to be the best pirate
l've ever seen.

600
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,946
So it would seem.

601
00:48:28,581 --> 00:48:30,457
When l was a lad, living in England,

602
00:48:30,499 --> 00:48:32,459
my mother raised me by herself.

603
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:34,502
After she died, l came out here,

604
00:48:34,587 --> 00:48:36,421
looking for my father.

605
00:48:37,882 --> 00:48:39,007
ls that so?

606
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:41,760
My father,

607
00:48:41,844 --> 00:48:43,219
Bill Turner?

608
00:48:43,304 --> 00:48:46,890
At the jail, it was only after you
learned my name that you agreed to help.

609
00:48:46,974 --> 00:48:49,684
Since that's what l wanted,
l didn't press the matter.

610
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:51,311
l'm not a simpleton, Jack.

611
00:48:51,354 --> 00:48:53,355
You knew my father.

612
00:48:59,528 --> 00:49:00,570
l knew him.

613
00:49:00,655 --> 00:49:03,573
Probably one of the few
who knew him as William Turner.

614
00:49:03,658 --> 00:49:07,077
Everyone else just called him
"Bootstrap," or "Bootstrap Bill."

615
00:49:07,161 --> 00:49:08,161
Bootstrap?

616
00:49:09,163 --> 00:49:11,581
Good man.
Good pirate.

617
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:13,750
l swear, you look just like him.

618
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:14,876
lt's not true.

619
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:16,711
He was a merchant sailor.

620
00:49:16,796 --> 00:49:19,047
A good, respectable man
who obeyed the law.

621
00:49:19,131 --> 00:49:21,299
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.

622
00:49:22,677 --> 00:49:25,387
My father was not a pirate!

623
00:49:26,555 --> 00:49:28,556
Put it away, son.

624
00:49:28,641 --> 00:49:30,558
lt's not worth you getting beat again.

625
00:49:30,643 --> 00:49:31,768
You didn't beat me.

626
00:49:31,852 --> 00:49:35,188
You ignored the rules of engagement.
ln a fair fight, l'd kill you.

627
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:38,066
That's not much incentive
for me to fight fair, is it?

628
00:49:45,408 --> 00:49:48,660
Now as long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

629
00:49:48,744 --> 00:49:51,246
The only rules
that really matter are these:

630
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:55,208
What a man can do,
and what a man can't do.

631
00:49:55,918 --> 00:49:57,085
For instance,

632
00:49:57,169 --> 00:50:00,296
you can accept that your father
was a pirate and a good man,

633
00:50:00,381 --> 00:50:01,423
or you can't.

634
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:05,010
Pirate is in your blood, boy, so
you'll have to square with that someday.

635
00:50:05,886 --> 00:50:08,054
Now, me, for example.
l could let you drown,

636
00:50:08,097 --> 00:50:12,600
but l can't bring this ship into Tortuga
all by me onesies. Savvy?

637
00:50:12,935 --> 00:50:13,935
So...

638
00:50:18,983 --> 00:50:22,318
Can you sail under
the command of a pirate?

639
00:50:23,571 --> 00:50:24,904
Or can you not?

640
00:50:27,616 --> 00:50:28,658
Tortuga?

641
00:50:28,743 --> 00:50:30,493
Tortuga.

642
00:50:52,558 --> 00:50:56,895
More importantly, it is indeed
a sad life that has never breathed deep

643
00:50:56,979 --> 00:51:00,148
the sweet, proliferous bouquet
that is Tortuga. Savvy?

644
00:51:01,901 --> 00:51:03,026
What do you think?

645
00:51:07,323 --> 00:51:08,406
lt'll linger.

646
00:51:08,491 --> 00:51:12,494
l'll tell you, mate, if every town
in the world were like this one,

647
00:51:12,578 --> 00:51:15,038
no man would ever feel unwanted.

648
00:51:16,999 --> 00:51:18,083
Scarlett!

649
00:51:20,002 --> 00:51:21,336
Not sure l deserved that.

650
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:24,297
Giselle!

651
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,340
Who was she?

652
00:51:25,424 --> 00:51:26,424
What?

653
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:30,011
l may have deserved that.

654
00:51:32,264 --> 00:51:35,391
Curse you for breathing,
you slack-jawed idiot!

655
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:39,854
Mother's love!

656
00:51:39,939 --> 00:51:40,939
Jack!

657
00:51:41,941 --> 00:51:45,068
You should know better than to
wake a man when he's sleepin'.

658
00:51:45,152 --> 00:51:49,030
- lt's bad luck.
- Fortunately, l know how to counter it.

659
00:51:49,115 --> 00:51:52,408
The man who did the waking buys
the man who was sleeping a drink,

660
00:51:52,493 --> 00:51:55,912
and the man who was sleeping drinks
while listening to a proposition

661
00:51:55,996 --> 00:51:57,705
from the man who did the waking.

662
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:01,709
Aye, that'll about do it.

663
00:52:06,549 --> 00:52:08,800
Blast! l'm already awake!

664
00:52:08,884 --> 00:52:10,260
That was for the smell.

665
00:52:20,729 --> 00:52:22,230
Keep a sharp eye.

666
00:52:29,363 --> 00:52:30,446
Now...

667
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:32,991
...what's the nature
of this venture of you'rn?

668
00:52:34,827 --> 00:52:36,911
l'm going after the Black Pearl.

669
00:52:40,749 --> 00:52:42,250
l know where it's going to be,

670
00:52:42,293 --> 00:52:44,085
and l'm gonna take it.

671
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:46,129
Jack,

672
00:52:46,213 --> 00:52:48,506
it's a fool's errand!

673
00:52:48,591 --> 00:52:51,926
Well, you know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl!

674
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:54,095
That's why l know
what Barbossa is up to.

675
00:52:55,097 --> 00:52:56,431
All l need is a crew.

676
00:52:57,141 --> 00:52:59,142
What l hear tell of Captain Barbossa,

677
00:52:59,226 --> 00:53:02,228
he's not a man to suffer fools,
nor strike a bargain with one!

678
00:53:02,271 --> 00:53:04,522
l'd say it's a good thing
l'm not a fool, then.

679
00:53:04,607 --> 00:53:05,690
Prove me wrong!

680
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:09,694
What makes you think Barbossa
will give up his ship to you?

681
00:53:09,778 --> 00:53:13,114
Let's just say
it's a matter of leverage, eh?

682
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:30,340
The kid?

683
00:53:31,926 --> 00:53:34,928
That is the child
of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

684
00:53:36,013 --> 00:53:38,473
His only child. Savvy?

685
00:53:38,557 --> 00:53:40,475
ls he now?

686
00:53:43,437 --> 00:53:45,813
Leverage, says you.

687
00:53:45,898 --> 00:53:48,858
l think l feel
a change in the wind, says l.

688
00:53:48,943 --> 00:53:50,318
l'll find us a crew.

689
00:53:50,361 --> 00:53:53,321
There's bound to be some sailors
on this rock, crazy as you.

690
00:53:53,364 --> 00:53:55,698
One can only hope.

691
00:53:55,783 --> 00:53:58,534
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!

692
00:54:23,394 --> 00:54:25,186
You'll be dining with the captain,

693
00:54:25,229 --> 00:54:27,605
and he requests you wear this.

694
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:32,193
Tell the captain l'm "disinclined
to acquiesce to his request."

695
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,571
He said you'd say that.

696
00:54:35,656 --> 00:54:38,032
He also said, if that be the case...

697
00:54:38,117 --> 00:54:39,867
...you'll be dining with the crew,

698
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,452
and you'll be naked.

699
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:49,294
Fine.

700
00:55:05,936 --> 00:55:09,522
There's no need to stand on ceremony
no call to impress anyone.

701
00:55:09,565 --> 00:55:11,941
You must be hungry.

702
00:55:29,376 --> 00:55:30,585
Try the wine.

703
00:55:35,424 --> 00:55:38,426
And the apples. One of those next.

704
00:55:46,727 --> 00:55:48,394
lt's poisoned.

705
00:55:49,938 --> 00:55:52,273
There would be no sense
to be killing you, Miss Turner.

706
00:55:52,316 --> 00:55:55,777
Then release me. You have your trinket.
l'm of no further value to you.

707
00:55:59,782 --> 00:56:01,824
You don't know what this is,

708
00:56:01,909 --> 00:56:03,284
do you?

709
00:56:03,369 --> 00:56:05,620
lt's a pirate medallion.

710
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:07,747
This is Aztec gold.

711
00:56:08,624 --> 00:56:11,417
One of 882 identical pieces

712
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:15,046
they delivered in a stone chest
to Cortés himself.

713
00:56:16,131 --> 00:56:20,343
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

714
00:56:20,427 --> 00:56:24,263
But the greed of Cortés was insatiable.

715
00:56:24,306 --> 00:56:27,809
So the heathen gods
placed upon the gold...

716
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:31,312
...a terrible curse.

717
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:37,193
Any mortal that removes but
a single piece from that stone chest...

718
00:56:38,195 --> 00:56:40,655
...shall be punished for eternity.

719
00:56:42,991 --> 00:56:46,369
l hardly believe in ghost stories
any more, Captain Barbossa.

720
00:56:46,495 --> 00:56:47,662
Aye.

721
00:56:48,497 --> 00:56:51,999
That's exactly what l thought
when we were first told the tale.

722
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:54,961
Buried on an lsle of the Dead
what cannot be found,

723
00:56:55,003 --> 00:56:56,879
except for those who know where it is.

724
00:56:58,590 --> 00:56:59,924
Find it, we did.

725
00:57:01,593 --> 00:57:02,927
There be the chest.

726
00:57:03,011 --> 00:57:04,804
lnside be the gold.

727
00:57:05,764 --> 00:57:08,182
And we took 'em all!

728
00:57:08,225 --> 00:57:10,226
We spent 'em and traded 'em,

729
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:11,978
and frittered 'em away

730
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,772
on drink and food
and pleasurable company.

731
00:57:14,857 --> 00:57:16,858
The more we gave 'em away,

732
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,569
the more we came to realise...

733
00:57:20,863 --> 00:57:23,030
...the drink would not satisfy.

734
00:57:24,283 --> 00:57:27,034
Food turned to ash in our mouths...

735
00:57:27,703 --> 00:57:30,288
...and all the pleasurable company
in the world

736
00:57:30,372 --> 00:57:32,373
could not slake our lust.

737
00:57:34,251 --> 00:57:37,044
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

738
00:57:38,797 --> 00:57:41,466
Compelled by greed we were, but now...

739
00:57:42,468 --> 00:57:44,886
...we are consumed by it.

740
00:57:56,064 --> 00:57:58,983
There is one way we can end our curse.

741
00:58:03,071 --> 00:58:06,032
All the scattered pieces
of the Aztec gold

742
00:58:06,074 --> 00:58:07,492
must be restored,

743
00:58:07,576 --> 00:58:09,994
and the blood repaid.

744
00:58:12,748 --> 00:58:14,123
Thanks to ye,

745
00:58:14,208 --> 00:58:16,334
we have the final piece.

746
00:58:18,378 --> 00:58:20,671
And the... blood to be repaid?

747
00:58:20,756 --> 00:58:23,257
That's why there's no sense
to be killing ya.

748
00:58:24,051 --> 00:58:25,051
Yet.

749
00:58:27,095 --> 00:58:28,596
Apple?

750
00:58:37,147 --> 00:58:38,147
No!

751
00:58:45,447 --> 00:58:46,447
l'm curious.

752
00:58:46,532 --> 00:58:49,450
After killing me, what is it
you're planning on doing next?

753
00:59:54,016 --> 00:59:55,224
Look!

754
00:59:55,309 --> 00:59:58,227
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

755
00:59:59,021 --> 01:00:02,273
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

756
01:00:02,357 --> 01:00:04,025
But neither are we dead.

757
01:00:05,277 --> 01:00:09,071
For too long l've been parched of thirst
and unable to quench it.

758
01:00:09,156 --> 01:00:11,532
Too long l've been starvin' to death,

759
01:00:11,617 --> 01:00:13,242
and haven't died!

760
01:00:13,869 --> 01:00:15,661
l feel nothing.

761
01:00:16,455 --> 01:00:19,373
Not the wind on my face,
nor the spray of the sea...

762
01:00:20,792 --> 01:00:22,960
...nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.

763
01:00:23,962 --> 01:00:28,466
You best start believing
in ghost stories, Miss Turner.

764
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:29,550
You're in one!

765
01:00:48,612 --> 01:00:50,691
What are you looking at?
Back to work!

766
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:01,457
Feast your eyes, captain.

767
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:04,460
All of them,
faithful hands before the mast.

768
01:01:04,544 --> 01:01:07,755
Every man worth his salt...

769
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:09,840
...and crazy to boot.

770
01:01:09,925 --> 01:01:12,760
So this is your able-bodied crew?

771
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,600
You, sailor!

772
01:01:19,685 --> 01:01:21,060
Cotton, sir.

773
01:01:21,103 --> 01:01:22,895
Mr Cotton.

774
01:01:22,938 --> 01:01:26,273
Do you have the courage and fortitude
to follow orders and stay true

775
01:01:26,358 --> 01:01:27,942
in the face of danger and death?

776
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:29,694
Mr Cotton!

777
01:01:29,778 --> 01:01:30,903
Answer, man!

778
01:01:30,946 --> 01:01:32,363
He's a mute, sir.

779
01:01:32,447 --> 01:01:34,156
Poor devil had his tongue cut out.

780
01:01:34,241 --> 01:01:36,283
So he trained the parrot
to talk for him.

781
01:01:36,368 --> 01:01:38,244
No one's yet figured how.

782
01:01:41,456 --> 01:01:43,082
Mr Cotton's parrot.

783
01:01:44,084 --> 01:01:45,584
Same question.

784
01:01:45,627 --> 01:01:48,379
Wind in the sails!
Wind in the sails!

785
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:51,590
Mostly, we figure that means "yes."

786
01:01:51,633 --> 01:01:53,134
Of course it does.

787
01:01:53,218 --> 01:01:54,218
Satisfied?

788
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:57,263
Well, you've proved they're mad!

789
01:01:57,305 --> 01:01:59,140
And what's the benefit for us?

790
01:02:09,651 --> 01:02:10,735
Anamaria!

791
01:02:12,654 --> 01:02:14,989
l suppose you didn't deserve
that one, either.

792
01:02:15,073 --> 01:02:16,991
No, that one l deserved.

793
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:18,784
You stole my boat!

794
01:02:18,827 --> 01:02:19,910
Actually...

795
01:02:21,997 --> 01:02:24,373
Borrowed. Borrowed, without permission,

796
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:27,042
but with every intention
of bringing it back to you.

797
01:02:27,127 --> 01:02:28,544
But you didn't!

798
01:02:28,628 --> 01:02:30,004
You'll get another one!

799
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:32,381
l will!

800
01:02:32,466 --> 01:02:33,466
A better one.

801
01:02:33,508 --> 01:02:34,967
A better one!

802
01:02:35,927 --> 01:02:37,511
- That one!
- What one?

803
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:41,390
That one?

804
01:02:44,853 --> 01:02:46,562
Aye. That one.

805
01:02:46,646 --> 01:02:48,230
- What say you?
- Aye!

806
01:02:48,315 --> 01:02:49,690
Aye!

807
01:02:49,775 --> 01:02:50,775
Anchors aweigh!

808
01:02:50,859 --> 01:02:54,069
No, no, no, no, no!
lt's frightful bad luck

809
01:02:54,154 --> 01:02:55,654
to bring a woman aboard, sir.

810
01:02:55,697 --> 01:02:58,365
lt'll be far worse not to have her.

811
01:03:32,067 --> 01:03:35,110
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find,

812
01:03:35,195 --> 01:03:37,655
with a compass that doesn't work?

813
01:03:37,739 --> 01:03:39,698
Aye, the compass doesn't point north,

814
01:03:39,741 --> 01:03:42,576
but we're not trying
to find north, are we?

815
01:03:53,255 --> 01:03:55,631
We should drop canvas, sir.

816
01:03:55,715 --> 01:03:57,758
She can hold a bit longer.

817
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:03,514
What's in your head that's put you
in such a fine mood, captain?

818
01:04:03,598 --> 01:04:05,599
We're catching up.

819
01:04:20,615 --> 01:04:22,616
Time to go, poppet.

820
01:05:18,173 --> 01:05:22,593
Dead men tell no tales...

821
01:05:25,138 --> 01:05:27,806
Puts a chill in the bones,
how many honest sailors

822
01:05:27,849 --> 01:05:29,683
have been claimed by this passage.

823
01:05:45,158 --> 01:05:47,534
How is it that Jack
came by that compass?

824
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:50,788
Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow
'fore he showed up in Tortuga

825
01:05:50,872 --> 01:05:53,540
with a mind to go after
the treasure of lsla de Muerte.

826
01:05:53,625 --> 01:05:54,875
That was before l met him,

827
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,127
back when he was captain
of the Black Pearl.

828
01:05:58,004 --> 01:05:59,004
What?

829
01:06:02,676 --> 01:06:04,134
He failed to mention that.

830
01:06:04,219 --> 01:06:06,470
He plays things closer to the vest now.

831
01:06:06,554 --> 01:06:08,639
And a hard-learned lesson it was.

832
01:06:08,723 --> 01:06:11,600
Three days before the venture,
the first mate comes says,

833
01:06:11,685 --> 01:06:14,770
"Everything's an equal share.
That should mean the location

834
01:06:14,854 --> 01:06:18,232
of the treasure, too,"
so Jack gives up the bearings.

835
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,567
That night, there was a mutiny.

836
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:24,279
They marooned Jack on an island
and left him to die.

837
01:06:24,364 --> 01:06:27,032
But not before he'd
gone mad with the heat.

838
01:06:31,121 --> 01:06:33,539
So that's the reason for all the...

839
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:37,292
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

840
01:06:38,253 --> 01:06:40,421
Now, Will, when a pirate's marooned,

841
01:06:40,505 --> 01:06:43,257
he's given a pistol with a single shot.
One shot...

842
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:46,635
Well, that won't do much good hunting,
nor to be rescued.

843
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,930
But after three weeks
of a starving belly and thirst,

844
01:06:49,973 --> 01:06:53,350
that pistol starts to look
real friendly.

845
01:06:53,435 --> 01:06:55,436
But Jack, he escaped the island,

846
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,104
and still has that single shot.

847
01:06:57,188 --> 01:06:59,773
He won't use it, though,
save on one man.

848
01:07:00,775 --> 01:07:02,818
His mutinous first mate.

849
01:07:02,902 --> 01:07:04,862
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

850
01:07:06,114 --> 01:07:09,074
- How did Jack get off the island?
- Well, l'll tell ye.

851
01:07:09,117 --> 01:07:11,243
He waded out into the shallows,

852
01:07:11,286 --> 01:07:13,871
and he waited there three days
and three nights,

853
01:07:13,955 --> 01:07:17,791
till all manner of sea creatures
came acclimated to his presence.

854
01:07:18,793 --> 01:07:20,335
And on the fourth morning,

855
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:24,548
he roped a couple of sea turtles,
lashed them together and made a raft.

856
01:07:26,801 --> 01:07:29,219
- He roped a couple of sea turtles.
- Aye.

857
01:07:29,304 --> 01:07:30,596
Sea turtles!

858
01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:34,850
What did he use for rope?

859
01:07:39,814 --> 01:07:41,398
Human hair.

860
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,817
From my back.

861
01:07:44,986 --> 01:07:46,361
Let go the anchor!

862
01:07:46,446 --> 01:07:48,822
Lower the anchor line!

863
01:07:48,907 --> 01:07:51,325
Young Mr Turner and l are to go ashore.

864
01:07:51,951 --> 01:07:53,077
Captain.

865
01:07:53,161 --> 01:07:54,870
What if the worst should happen?

866
01:07:55,747 --> 01:07:58,248
- Keep to the code.
- Aye. The code.

867
01:08:25,318 --> 01:08:27,319
Ten years of hoarding swag!

868
01:08:27,362 --> 01:08:29,863
And now we finally get to spend it!

869
01:08:37,205 --> 01:08:39,998
Once we're quit of the curse,
we'll be rich men...

870
01:08:40,708 --> 01:08:44,419
...and you can buy an eye what
actually fits and is made of glass.

871
01:08:44,504 --> 01:08:47,422
This one does splinter
something terrible!

872
01:08:48,508 --> 01:08:49,716
Stop rubbing it!

873
01:09:09,362 --> 01:09:12,406
What code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

874
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:14,741
The pirates' code.

875
01:09:14,826 --> 01:09:16,243
Any man who falls behind...

876
01:09:16,286 --> 01:09:18,620
...is left behind.

877
01:09:19,956 --> 01:09:22,249
No heroes amongst thieves.

878
01:09:22,959 --> 01:09:26,044
You know, for having
such a bleak outlook on pirates,

879
01:09:26,087 --> 01:09:29,006
you're well on your way
to becoming one.

880
01:09:29,507 --> 01:09:31,091
Sprung a man from jail...

881
01:09:32,427 --> 01:09:34,928
...commandeered a ship of the Fleet,

882
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:37,514
sailed with a buccaneer crew
out of Tortuga...

883
01:09:39,684 --> 01:09:42,936
...and you're completely
obsessed with treasure!

884
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:46,815
That's not true.

885
01:09:47,525 --> 01:09:49,276
l am not obsessed with treasure.

886
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:59,244
Not all treasure
is silver and gold, mate.

887
01:09:59,287 --> 01:10:00,954
Gentlemen, the time has come!

888
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:02,623
Hurrah!

889
01:10:02,707 --> 01:10:04,833
Salvation is nigh!

890
01:10:04,918 --> 01:10:06,335
Yeah!

891
01:10:06,419 --> 01:10:09,129
- Our torment is nearing an end!
- Elizabeth.

892
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:12,591
For ten years,
we've been tested and tried,

893
01:10:12,634 --> 01:10:14,384
and each man-jack of you here

894
01:10:14,469 --> 01:10:17,471
has proved his mettle 100 times over.

895
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:19,806
And 100 times again!

896
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:20,849
Yeah!

897
01:10:21,976 --> 01:10:23,560
Suffered, l have!

898
01:10:24,312 --> 01:10:26,146
Punished, we were,

899
01:10:26,189 --> 01:10:27,731
the lot of us,

900
01:10:27,815 --> 01:10:31,151
disproportionate to our crime!

901
01:10:31,236 --> 01:10:33,028
Right!

902
01:10:33,112 --> 01:10:34,321
Here it is!

903
01:10:37,992 --> 01:10:41,620
The cursed treasure of Cortés himself.

904
01:10:43,623 --> 01:10:46,166
Every last piece that went astray,

905
01:10:46,209 --> 01:10:47,960
we have returned.

906
01:10:48,002 --> 01:10:49,711
Save for this!

907
01:10:49,796 --> 01:10:51,213
- Yeah!
- Jack!

908
01:10:51,297 --> 01:10:53,924
Not yet!

909
01:10:54,008 --> 01:10:56,510
We'll wait for the opportune moment.

910
01:10:56,594 --> 01:10:59,346
881 we found, but despaired
of ever finding the last.

911
01:10:59,389 --> 01:11:01,223
When's that?

912
01:11:01,307 --> 01:11:04,017
When it's of greatest profit to you?

913
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:05,394
May l ask you something?

914
01:11:06,771 --> 01:11:09,106
Have l ever given you
reason not to trust me?

915
01:11:10,483 --> 01:11:11,483
Do us a favour.

916
01:11:11,526 --> 01:11:13,652
l know it's difficult for you,

917
01:11:13,695 --> 01:11:15,737
but please, stay here,

918
01:11:15,822 --> 01:11:18,699
and try not to do anything stupid.

919
01:11:21,369 --> 01:11:23,870
And who among us
has paid the blood sacrifice

920
01:11:23,955 --> 01:11:26,206
- owed to the heathen gods?
- Aye!

921
01:11:26,291 --> 01:11:29,126
And whose blood must yet be paid?

922
01:11:29,210 --> 01:11:30,877
Hers!

923
01:11:33,047 --> 01:11:37,634
You know the first thing l'm going
to do after the curse is lifted?

924
01:11:39,971 --> 01:11:43,307
Eat a whole bushel of apples!

925
01:11:51,149 --> 01:11:53,150
Begun by blood,

926
01:11:53,234 --> 01:11:55,235
by blood undone.

927
01:11:59,699 --> 01:12:00,741
Sorry, Jack.

928
01:12:00,825 --> 01:12:03,368
l'm not going to be your leverage.

929
01:12:12,587 --> 01:12:14,755
That's it?

930
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:16,465
Waste not.

931
01:12:54,462 --> 01:12:55,796
Did it work?

932
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:58,715
- l don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?

933
01:13:05,807 --> 01:13:07,307
You're not dead!

934
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,976
No.

935
01:13:10,937 --> 01:13:12,270
He shot me!

936
01:13:12,313 --> 01:13:13,814
lt didn't work!

937
01:13:13,898 --> 01:13:15,857
The curse is still upon us!

938
01:13:20,947 --> 01:13:23,407
You! Maid! Your father,
what was his name?

939
01:13:23,491 --> 01:13:25,742
Was your father William Turner?

940
01:13:26,077 --> 01:13:27,327
No.

941
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:30,872
Where's his child? The child that sailed
from England eight years ago?

942
01:13:30,957 --> 01:13:33,667
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner?

943
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:34,709
Where?

944
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:43,009
You two!

945
01:13:44,011 --> 01:13:46,096
- You brought us the wrong person!
- Yeah!

946
01:13:47,056 --> 01:13:48,056
No!

947
01:13:48,808 --> 01:13:51,601
She had the medallion!
She's the proper age!

948
01:13:51,686 --> 01:13:53,854
She said her name was Turner.
You heard her!

949
01:13:56,107 --> 01:13:57,190
l think she lied to us!

950
01:13:57,233 --> 01:13:58,233
Yeah!

951
01:14:00,027 --> 01:14:02,362
You brought us here for nothing!

952
01:14:02,405 --> 01:14:06,533
I won't take questioning or second guesses, 
not from the likes of you, Master Twigg.

953
01:14:06,617 --> 01:14:07,868
Who's to blame him?

954
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:10,871
Every decision you've made
has led us from bad to worse!

955
01:14:13,082 --> 01:14:15,667
lt was you who sent
Bootstrap to the depths!

956
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:16,710
Yeah!

957
01:14:19,505 --> 01:14:22,090
And it's you who brought us
here in the first place!

958
01:14:23,885 --> 01:14:26,553
lf any coward here dare challenge me,
let him speak!

959
01:14:28,848 --> 01:14:30,765
l say, we cut her throat,

960
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:32,476
and spill all her blood!

961
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:33,560
Just in case.

962
01:14:33,603 --> 01:14:34,603
Yeah!

963
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:44,905
The medallion!

964
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:46,281
She's taken it!

965
01:14:46,365 --> 01:14:50,827
Get after her,
you feckless pack of ingrates!

966
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:59,377
- Where's the oars?
- There's no oars!

967
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:02,255
The oars have gone missing!
Find them!

968
01:15:11,349 --> 01:15:12,349
You!

969
01:15:14,435 --> 01:15:16,102
You're supposed to be dead!

970
01:15:16,145 --> 01:15:17,479
Am l not?

971
01:15:36,916 --> 01:15:39,668
...parsnip... pars-ley...

972
01:15:39,752 --> 01:15:41,753
...Partner, pardoner...

973
01:15:41,796 --> 01:15:42,796
Parley?

974
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,714
That's the one! Parley!

975
01:15:45,466 --> 01:15:46,466
Parley!

976
01:15:46,509 --> 01:15:47,801
Parley?!

977
01:15:49,053 --> 01:15:52,847
Damned to the depths whatever
madman thought of parley!

978
01:15:54,475 --> 01:15:56,768
That would be the French.

979
01:16:08,573 --> 01:16:09,781
Not more pirates!

980
01:16:09,824 --> 01:16:11,866
Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

981
01:16:12,827 --> 01:16:14,035
Mr Gibbs?

982
01:16:14,745 --> 01:16:16,037
Hey boy, where be Jack?

983
01:16:17,164 --> 01:16:19,666
Jack? Jack Sparrow?

984
01:16:20,918 --> 01:16:22,419
He fell behind.

985
01:16:29,969 --> 01:16:31,511
Keep to the code!

986
01:16:32,763 --> 01:16:35,557
Weigh anchor!
Hoist the sails!

987
01:16:35,641 --> 01:16:37,309
Split-quick, you dibbies!

988
01:16:43,524 --> 01:16:46,568
How the blazes
did you get off that island?

989
01:16:47,987 --> 01:16:51,406
When you marooned me on
that godforsaken spit of land,

990
01:16:51,490 --> 01:16:53,867
you forgot one
very important thing, mate.

991
01:16:55,453 --> 01:16:57,203
l'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

992
01:16:57,913 --> 01:17:01,541
Well, l won't be making that mistake...

993
01:17:01,584 --> 01:17:02,792
...again.

994
01:17:03,586 --> 01:17:07,047
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?

995
01:17:07,131 --> 01:17:08,131
Aye.

996
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:10,133
Kill him.

997
01:17:11,594 --> 01:17:13,928
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?

998
01:17:16,599 --> 01:17:17,766
Hold your fire!

999
01:17:24,398 --> 01:17:26,941
You know whose blood we need?

1000
01:17:28,653 --> 01:17:30,528
l know whose blood you need.

1001
01:17:37,662 --> 01:17:40,246
What sort of a man
trades a man's life for a ship?

1002
01:17:40,331 --> 01:17:41,581
A pirate.

1003
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:44,084
Here.

1004
01:17:44,168 --> 01:17:45,877
Let me.

1005
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,420
Thank you.

1006
01:17:48,798 --> 01:17:51,383
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours.

1007
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:54,260
Why?

1008
01:17:57,598 --> 01:17:58,848
l don't know.

1009
01:18:00,851 --> 01:18:03,061
l'm sorry. A blacksmith's hands.

1010
01:18:03,104 --> 01:18:07,691
- l know they're rough.
- No... l mean, yes, they are, but...

1011
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:11,945
But don't stop.

1012
01:18:20,454 --> 01:18:21,871
Elizabeth!

1013
01:18:37,805 --> 01:18:39,139
lt's yours.

1014
01:18:43,561 --> 01:18:46,980
l thought l'd lost it
the day they rescued me.

1015
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:48,481
lt was a gift from my father.

1016
01:18:48,566 --> 01:18:50,650
He sent it to me.

1017
01:18:56,323 --> 01:18:57,866
Why did you take it?

1018
01:18:59,994 --> 01:19:02,746
Because l was afraid
that you were a pirate.

1019
01:19:04,331 --> 01:19:06,124
That would've been awful.

1020
01:19:09,587 --> 01:19:11,379
lt wasn't your blood they needed.

1021
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:16,426
lt was my father's blood.

1022
01:19:18,888 --> 01:19:21,473
My blood.

1023
01:19:26,395 --> 01:19:27,771
The blood of a pirate.

1024
01:19:27,855 --> 01:19:29,981
Will, l'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

1025
01:19:43,329 --> 01:19:46,956
So you expect to leave me standin' on
some beach, with nothing but a name

1026
01:19:47,041 --> 01:19:52,378
and your word it's the one l need,
and watch you sail away in my ship?

1027
01:19:52,463 --> 01:19:53,630
No.

1028
01:19:53,714 --> 01:19:57,842
l expect to leave you standing on some
beach with absolutely no name at all,

1029
01:19:57,885 --> 01:19:59,969
watching me sail away on my ship,

1030
01:20:00,054 --> 01:20:02,931
and then l'll shout
the name back to you.

1031
01:20:03,015 --> 01:20:04,349
Savvy?

1032
01:20:04,391 --> 01:20:07,435
That still leaves the problem
of me standing on some beach,

1033
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,356
with naught but a name and your word
it's the one l need.

1034
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:13,733
Of the two of us,

1035
01:20:13,818 --> 01:20:17,612
l am the only one who
hasn't committed mutiny.

1036
01:20:17,696 --> 01:20:21,699
Therefore, my word is
the one we'll be trusting.

1037
01:20:21,742 --> 01:20:23,326
Although...

1038
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:25,995
l suppose l should be thanking you
because, in fact,

1039
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:28,540
if you hadn't betrayed me
and left me to die,

1040
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:33,878
l would have an equal share
in that curse, same as you.

1041
01:20:33,921 --> 01:20:35,338
Funny ol' world, isn't it?

1042
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:41,803
Captain! We're coming up
on the Interceptor.

1043
01:20:54,942 --> 01:20:56,985
l'm having a thought here, Barbossa.

1044
01:20:57,653 --> 01:20:59,445
What say we run up a flag of truce,

1045
01:20:59,530 --> 01:21:01,322
l scurry over to the Interceptor,

1046
01:21:01,407 --> 01:21:04,868
and l negotiate the return of your
medallion. What say you to that?

1047
01:21:05,828 --> 01:21:09,372
Now you see, Jack, that's exactly
the attitude that lost you the Pearl.

1048
01:21:09,456 --> 01:21:12,333
People are easier to search
when they're dead.

1049
01:21:13,377 --> 01:21:14,711
Lock him in the brig.

1050
01:21:26,974 --> 01:21:29,434
Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants!

1051
01:21:29,476 --> 01:21:32,812
With this wind dead astern,
she'll carry every sail we've got.

1052
01:21:32,855 --> 01:21:34,981
- What's happening?
-The Black Pearl!

1053
01:21:35,024 --> 01:21:36,524
She's gaining on us!

1054
01:21:41,113 --> 01:21:43,489
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean!

1055
01:21:43,574 --> 01:21:46,326
You can tell them that
after they've caught us!

1056
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:48,286
We're shallower on the draft, right?

1057
01:21:48,329 --> 01:21:49,329
Aye.

1058
01:21:49,413 --> 01:21:51,497
Can't we lose them amongst those shoals?

1059
01:21:52,958 --> 01:21:54,667
We don't have to outrun 'em long.

1060
01:21:54,710 --> 01:21:56,002
Just long enough.

1061
01:21:56,045 --> 01:21:57,337
Lighten the ship!

1062
01:21:57,421 --> 01:21:58,588
Stem to stern!

1063
01:21:58,672 --> 01:22:01,758
Anything we can afford to lose,
see that it's lost!

1064
01:22:11,185 --> 01:22:13,186
Apparently, there's a leak.

1065
01:22:27,868 --> 01:22:31,037
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!

1066
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,289
And run out the sweeps.

1067
01:23:01,527 --> 01:23:02,777
We're gonna need that.

1068
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:14,664
lt was a good plan, up till now.

1069
01:23:14,748 --> 01:23:16,207
Gibbs!

1070
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:17,667
We have to make a stand.

1071
01:23:17,751 --> 01:23:19,168
We must fight!

1072
01:23:20,087 --> 01:23:22,213
- Load the guns!
- With what?

1073
01:23:22,256 --> 01:23:24,007
Anything! Everything!

1074
01:23:24,091 --> 01:23:25,800
Anything we have left!

1075
01:23:27,845 --> 01:23:29,804
Load the guns!

1076
01:23:29,888 --> 01:23:31,597
Case shot and langrage!

1077
01:23:31,682 --> 01:23:33,266
Nails and crushed glass!

1078
01:23:35,769 --> 01:23:36,978
With a will!

1079
01:23:58,292 --> 01:24:01,127
The Pearl's gonna luff up
on our port quarter!

1080
01:24:01,211 --> 01:24:03,796
She'll rake us without ever
presenting a target!

1081
01:24:03,839 --> 01:24:05,923
Lower the anchor on the right side.

1082
01:24:06,508 --> 01:24:07,925
On the starboard side!

1083
01:24:09,011 --> 01:24:12,096
- lt has the element of surprise.
- You're daft, lady!

1084
01:24:12,139 --> 01:24:13,139
You both are!

1085
01:24:13,223 --> 01:24:14,640
Daft like Jack!

1086
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:16,851
Lower the starboard anchor!

1087
01:24:17,478 --> 01:24:21,022
Do it, you gobs, or it's you
we'll load into the cannons!

1088
01:24:21,106 --> 01:24:22,648
Aye!

1089
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:40,750
Let go!

1090
01:24:47,341 --> 01:24:49,008
They're club haulin'!

1091
01:24:49,093 --> 01:24:51,844
Hard a port!
Rack the starboard oars!

1092
01:24:51,929 --> 01:24:53,679
Hard a port!

1093
01:25:05,067 --> 01:25:06,317
Keep her steady, man.

1094
01:25:13,367 --> 01:25:14,367
Now!

1095
01:25:14,451 --> 01:25:16,744
Fire!

1096
01:25:26,505 --> 01:25:28,506
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

1097
01:26:15,095 --> 01:26:17,263
We could use a few more ideas, lass!

1098
01:26:17,347 --> 01:26:18,931
lt's your turn!

1099
01:26:18,974 --> 01:26:20,766
We need us a devil's dowry!

1100
01:26:20,809 --> 01:26:22,143
We'll give them her!

1101
01:26:23,145 --> 01:26:24,645
She's not what they're after.

1102
01:26:27,232 --> 01:26:28,566
The medallion!

1103
01:26:49,922 --> 01:26:53,257
Strike your colours,
you bloomin' cockroaches!

1104
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:56,052
Hands, grapnels, at the ready!

1105
01:26:56,136 --> 01:26:57,970
Prepare to board!

1106
01:27:32,297 --> 01:27:35,132
Pistols and cutlasses, men!

1107
01:27:35,175 --> 01:27:37,468
Koehler and Twigg
to the powder magazine!

1108
01:27:37,511 --> 01:27:40,846
And the rest of you,
bring me the medallion!

1109
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:52,817
Hey! Hey!

1110
01:28:08,625 --> 01:28:11,294
Hey! Below!

1111
01:28:31,064 --> 01:28:32,565
Thanks very much.

1112
01:28:45,954 --> 01:28:46,954
Jack!

1113
01:28:48,332 --> 01:28:50,124
Bloody empty!

1114
01:29:06,058 --> 01:29:07,933
That's not very nice.

1115
01:29:12,564 --> 01:29:13,773
Where is the medallion?

1116
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:14,899
Wretch!

1117
01:29:17,944 --> 01:29:19,278
Where is dear William?

1118
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:22,740
Will!

1119
01:29:24,951 --> 01:29:27,161
- Will!
- Elizabeth!

1120
01:29:30,123 --> 01:29:31,248
Monkey!

1121
01:29:37,923 --> 01:29:39,757
l can't move it!

1122
01:29:41,134 --> 01:29:42,134
Will!

1123
01:29:42,177 --> 01:29:43,302
Elizabeth!

1124
01:29:43,345 --> 01:29:44,428
Will!

1125
01:29:55,524 --> 01:29:57,691
Why, thank you, Jack.

1126
01:29:57,776 --> 01:29:59,402
You're welcome.

1127
01:29:59,486 --> 01:30:02,029
Not you. We named the monkey Jack.

1128
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:06,158
Gents! Our hope is restored!

1129
01:30:06,243 --> 01:30:07,660
Yeah!

1130
01:30:42,195 --> 01:30:46,198
Any of you so much
as thinks the word parley,

1131
01:30:46,283 --> 01:30:49,034
l'll have your guts for garters!

1132
01:30:56,918 --> 01:30:58,335
Will!

1133
01:30:58,378 --> 01:31:00,379
You godless pirate!

1134
01:31:01,256 --> 01:31:03,215
Welcome back, miss.

1135
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:06,051
You took advantage of
our hospitality last time.

1136
01:31:06,094 --> 01:31:09,430
lt holds fair now
that you return the favour!

1137
01:31:15,395 --> 01:31:16,479
Barbossa!

1138
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:19,440
Will.

1139
01:31:22,235 --> 01:31:23,235
She goes free!

1140
01:31:24,362 --> 01:31:26,071
What's in your head, boy?

1141
01:31:27,449 --> 01:31:28,741
She goes free.

1142
01:31:29,409 --> 01:31:32,453
You've only got one shot,
and we can't die.

1143
01:31:32,537 --> 01:31:34,538
Don't do anything stupid!

1144
01:31:37,501 --> 01:31:38,751
You can't.

1145
01:31:38,835 --> 01:31:40,252
l can.

1146
01:31:41,963 --> 01:31:43,589
Like that.

1147
01:31:44,633 --> 01:31:45,925
Who are you?

1148
01:31:45,967 --> 01:31:47,468
No one! He's no one!

1149
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:51,430
A distant cousin of my aunt's
nephew, twice removed.

1150
01:31:51,473 --> 01:31:53,766
Lovely singing voice, though. Eunuch!

1151
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:55,476
My name is Will Turner!

1152
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:58,270
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.

1153
01:31:58,313 --> 01:32:00,272
His blood runs in my veins.

1154
01:32:00,982 --> 01:32:03,275
lt's the spitting image
of ol' Bootstrap Bill,

1155
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,152
come back to haunt us!

1156
01:32:05,237 --> 01:32:07,238
On my word, do as l say,

1157
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:09,156
or l'll pull this trigger,

1158
01:32:09,241 --> 01:32:11,450
and be lost to Davy Jones' locker!

1159
01:32:12,494 --> 01:32:14,787
Name your terms, Mr Turner.

1160
01:32:14,829 --> 01:32:15,996
Elizabeth goes free!

1161
01:32:16,081 --> 01:32:17,706
Yes, we know that one.

1162
01:32:17,791 --> 01:32:18,791
Anything else?

1163
01:32:21,461 --> 01:32:22,753
And the crew!

1164
01:32:22,796 --> 01:32:24,755
The crew are not to be harmed!

1165
01:32:29,511 --> 01:32:31,303
Agreed.

1166
01:32:50,490 --> 01:32:52,157
Barbossa, you lying bastard!

1167
01:32:52,242 --> 01:32:54,827
You swore she'd go free!

1168
01:32:54,911 --> 01:32:57,162
Don't dare impugn me honour, boy!

1169
01:32:57,247 --> 01:32:58,914
l agreed she'd go free.

1170
01:32:58,999 --> 01:33:02,042
But it was you who failed 
to specify when or where.

1171
01:33:07,716 --> 01:33:11,677
Though it does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it, lads?

1172
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:12,720
Aye.

1173
01:33:13,722 --> 01:33:16,890
So l'll be havin' that dress
back before you go.

1174
01:33:21,229 --> 01:33:22,730
l always liked you.

1175
01:33:26,359 --> 01:33:28,694
Goes with your black heart!

1176
01:33:29,279 --> 01:33:31,447
lt's still warm.

1177
01:33:34,826 --> 01:33:36,869
Off you go!

1178
01:33:36,953 --> 01:33:38,287
Come on!

1179
01:33:41,916 --> 01:33:43,083
Too long!

1180
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:56,722
l'd really rather hoped
we were past all this.

1181
01:33:58,308 --> 01:33:59,725
Jack.

1182
01:33:59,768 --> 01:34:00,851
Jack!

1183
01:34:02,604 --> 01:34:04,063
Did ya not notice?

1184
01:34:04,147 --> 01:34:08,400
That be the same island that we made you
Governor of on our last little trip.

1185
01:34:09,694 --> 01:34:11,362
l did notice.

1186
01:34:11,404 --> 01:34:15,574
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up
another miraculous escape,

1187
01:34:15,617 --> 01:34:17,242
but l doubt it.

1188
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:21,622
Off you go.

1189
01:34:22,624 --> 01:34:25,250
Last time you left me
a pistol with one shot.

1190
01:34:25,335 --> 01:34:26,919
By the powers, you're right!

1191
01:34:27,003 --> 01:34:29,129
Where be Jack's pistol?

1192
01:34:29,214 --> 01:34:30,381
Bring it forward.

1193
01:34:33,551 --> 01:34:36,345
Seeing as there's two of us,
a gentleman...

1194
01:34:37,055 --> 01:34:38,847
...would give us a pair of pistols.

1195
01:34:38,932 --> 01:34:40,641
lt'll be one pistol, as before,

1196
01:34:40,725 --> 01:34:43,519
and you can be the gentleman
and shoot the lady,

1197
01:34:43,603 --> 01:34:45,437
and starve to death yourself!

1198
01:35:09,796 --> 01:35:13,340
That's the second time l've had to watch
that man sail away with my ship.

1199
01:35:15,802 --> 01:35:18,470
But you were marooned on this island
before, weren't you?

1200
01:35:18,555 --> 01:35:20,139
We can escape in the same way 
you did then!

1201
01:35:20,181 --> 01:35:22,307
To what point and purpose, young missy?

1202
01:35:23,059 --> 01:35:24,810
The Black Pearl is gone,

1203
01:35:24,853 --> 01:35:28,313
and unless you have a rudder and
a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...

1204
01:35:28,398 --> 01:35:30,816
Unlikely...

1205
01:35:30,859 --> 01:35:33,819
Young Mr Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

1206
01:35:36,489 --> 01:35:38,824
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow!

1207
01:35:38,867 --> 01:35:43,287
You vanished from under the eyes of
seven agents of the East lndia Company!

1208
01:35:43,329 --> 01:35:46,081
You sacked Nassau Port
without even firing a shot!

1209
01:35:46,166 --> 01:35:48,417
Are you the pirate
l've read about or not?

1210
01:35:50,962 --> 01:35:52,463
How did you escape last time?

1211
01:35:59,304 --> 01:36:01,180
Last time...

1212
01:36:01,222 --> 01:36:04,016
...l was here a grand total
of three days, all right?

1213
01:36:05,018 --> 01:36:06,018
Last time...

1214
01:36:08,062 --> 01:36:11,356
...the rum runners used this island
as a cache.

1215
01:36:11,399 --> 01:36:13,859
They came by and l was able
to barter passage off.

1216
01:36:13,943 --> 01:36:15,694
From the looks of things,

1217
01:36:15,779 --> 01:36:17,988
they've long been out of business.

1218
01:36:18,031 --> 01:36:23,160
You probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

1219
01:36:23,203 --> 01:36:24,745
So that's it then?

1220
01:36:26,039 --> 01:36:29,875
That's the secret, grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow!

1221
01:36:30,877 --> 01:36:32,669
You spent three days,

1222
01:36:32,712 --> 01:36:35,047
lying on a beach, drinking rum.

1223
01:36:37,425 --> 01:36:41,220
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

1224
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:52,523
</i>We're devils, we're black sheep
We're really bad eggs</i>

1225
01:36:52,565 --> 01:36:54,733
</i>Drink up, me hearties
Yo ho</i>

1226
01:36:54,818 --> 01:36:59,363
</i>Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me</i>

1227
01:36:59,405 --> 01:37:01,281
l love this song!

1228
01:37:04,244 --> 01:37:06,411
Really bad eggs!

1229
01:37:11,292 --> 01:37:13,293
When l get the Pearl back,

1230
01:37:13,378 --> 01:37:15,879
l'm gonna teach it to the whole crew,

1231
01:37:15,922 --> 01:37:17,464
and we'll sing it all the time!

1232
01:37:17,549 --> 01:37:21,343
And you will be positively the most
fearsome pirates in the Spanish Main!

1233
01:37:21,427 --> 01:37:23,262
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

1234
01:37:24,305 --> 01:37:26,014
The entire ocean!

1235
01:37:26,099 --> 01:37:27,850
The entire world!

1236
01:37:27,934 --> 01:37:30,769
Wherever we want to go, we go.

1237
01:37:30,812 --> 01:37:32,396
That's what a ship is, you know.

1238
01:37:32,438 --> 01:37:35,274
lt's not just a keel and a hull
and a deck and sails.

1239
01:37:35,358 --> 01:37:36,859
That's what a ship needs.

1240
01:37:36,943 --> 01:37:38,944
But what a ship is...

1241
01:37:40,321 --> 01:37:43,282
What the Black Pearl really is...

1242
01:37:44,742 --> 01:37:47,995
...is freedom.

1243
01:37:48,997 --> 01:37:50,080
Jack...

1244
01:37:50,123 --> 01:37:54,877
lt must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island.

1245
01:37:55,670 --> 01:37:56,879
Oh, yes.

1246
01:37:56,963 --> 01:37:59,798
But the company is...

1247
01:37:59,841 --> 01:38:02,634
...infinitely better than last time,
and the...

1248
01:38:04,429 --> 01:38:08,140
- ...scenery has definitely improved.
- Mr Sparrow!

1249
01:38:08,182 --> 01:38:12,227
l'm not entirely sure l've had
enough rum to allow that kind of talk.

1250
01:38:13,855 --> 01:38:15,647
l know exactly what you mean, love.

1251
01:38:23,156 --> 01:38:24,698
To freedom!

1252
01:38:27,452 --> 01:38:28,994
To the Black Pearl.

1253
01:38:58,524 --> 01:38:59,608
No!

1254
01:38:59,692 --> 01:39:02,486
Not good! Stop!

1255
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,737
Not good!

1256
01:39:03,821 --> 01:39:04,821
What are you doing?

1257
01:39:04,864 --> 01:39:06,949
You've burned all the food, the shade...

1258
01:39:07,033 --> 01:39:09,284
- ...the rum!
- Yes, the rum is gone.

1259
01:39:09,369 --> 01:39:10,619
Why is the rum gone?

1260
01:39:11,079 --> 01:39:12,955
One, because it is a vile drink

1261
01:39:13,039 --> 01:39:15,958
that turns even the most respectable
men into complete scoundrels.

1262
01:39:16,042 --> 01:39:19,127
Two, that signal
is over 1,000 feet high.

1263
01:39:19,212 --> 01:39:21,421
The entire Royal Navy
is out looking for me.

1264
01:39:21,506 --> 01:39:23,882
Do you really think there is even
the slightest chance

1265
01:39:23,925 --> 01:39:25,092
they won't see it?

1266
01:39:25,176 --> 01:39:27,010
But why is the rum gone?

1267
01:39:28,096 --> 01:39:29,554
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.

1268
01:39:29,597 --> 01:39:31,390
You give it one hour, maybe two,

1269
01:39:31,474 --> 01:39:36,395
keep a weather eye open, and you
will see white sails on that horizon.

1270
01:39:41,901 --> 01:39:44,903
"Must've been terrible for you
to be trapped here, Jack."

1271
01:39:44,946 --> 01:39:48,031
"Must've been terrible for you..."
Well, it bloody is now!

1272
01:39:55,415 --> 01:39:58,750
There'll be no
living with her after this.

1273
01:39:58,835 --> 01:40:00,752
- But we've got to save Will!
- No!

1274
01:40:00,795 --> 01:40:02,254
You're safe now.

1275
01:40:02,338 --> 01:40:04,423
We will return to
Port Royal immediately,

1276
01:40:04,507 --> 01:40:06,466
not go gallivanting after pirates!

1277
01:40:06,551 --> 01:40:08,468
Then we condemn him to death!

1278
01:40:09,554 --> 01:40:12,264
The boy's fate is regrettable...

1279
01:40:12,348 --> 01:40:14,933
...but then, so was his decision
to engage in piracy.

1280
01:40:15,018 --> 01:40:18,270
To rescue me! To prevent anything
from happening to me!

1281
01:40:18,354 --> 01:40:22,190
lf l may be so bold as to inject 
my professional opinion,

1282
01:40:22,275 --> 01:40:25,444
the Pearl was listing
near to scuppers after the battle.

1283
01:40:25,486 --> 01:40:28,405
lt's very unlikely she'd be able
to make good time.

1284
01:40:28,448 --> 01:40:29,781
Think about it.

1285
01:40:29,866 --> 01:40:32,075
The Black Pearl.

1286
01:40:32,118 --> 01:40:35,662
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

1287
01:40:36,664 --> 01:40:38,623
How can you pass that up?

1288
01:40:40,793 --> 01:40:43,628
By remembering that l serve others,
Mr Sparrow,

1289
01:40:43,671 --> 01:40:46,173
- not only myself.
- Commodore, l beg you!

1290
01:40:46,257 --> 01:40:47,257
Please do this!

1291
01:40:47,300 --> 01:40:48,925
For me!

1292
01:40:48,968 --> 01:40:51,136
As a wedding gift.

1293
01:40:51,220 --> 01:40:52,387
Elizabeth?

1294
01:40:53,473 --> 01:40:56,016
Are you accepting
the commodore's proposal?

1295
01:40:58,436 --> 01:40:59,478
l am.

1296
01:41:00,313 --> 01:41:01,980
A wedding! l love weddings!

1297
01:41:02,065 --> 01:41:03,815
Drinks all around!

1298
01:41:06,110 --> 01:41:08,862
l know. "Clap him in irons," right?

1299
01:41:11,407 --> 01:41:12,574
Mr Sparrow...

1300
01:41:13,910 --> 01:41:16,244
...you will accompany
these fine men to the helm

1301
01:41:16,329 --> 01:41:18,830
and provide us with a bearing
to lsla de Muerta.

1302
01:41:18,873 --> 01:41:22,793
You'll then spend the rest of the voyage
contemplating all possible meanings

1303
01:41:22,835 --> 01:41:25,337
of the phrase "silent as the grave."

1304
01:41:25,379 --> 01:41:26,963
Do l make myself clear?

1305
01:41:27,006 --> 01:41:29,091
lnescapably clear.

1306
01:41:33,888 --> 01:41:35,347
Shiver me timbers!

1307
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:37,766
Cotton says you missed a bit.

1308
01:41:42,772 --> 01:41:44,147
You knew William Turner?

1309
01:41:46,025 --> 01:41:48,110
Old Bootstrap Bill.

1310
01:41:48,194 --> 01:41:49,194
We knew him.

1311
01:41:50,196 --> 01:41:54,199
Never sat well with Bootstrap,
what we did to Jack Sparrow,

1312
01:41:54,242 --> 01:41:56,326
the mutiny and all.

1313
01:41:56,911 --> 01:41:58,912
He said it wasn't right with the code.

1314
01:41:59,997 --> 01:42:03,166
That's why he sent off a piece of
the treasure to you, as it were.

1315
01:42:03,209 --> 01:42:06,837
He said we deserved to be cursed...

1316
01:42:08,422 --> 01:42:10,507
...and remain cursed.

1317
01:42:10,550 --> 01:42:11,591
Stupid blighter!

1318
01:42:11,676 --> 01:42:13,510
Good man.

1319
01:42:13,553 --> 01:42:15,387
But, as you can imagine,

1320
01:42:16,389 --> 01:42:18,807
that didn't sit too well
with the captain.

1321
01:42:18,891 --> 01:42:22,144
That didn't sit too well
with the captain at all!

1322
01:42:22,228 --> 01:42:25,856
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- l'm telling the story!

1323
01:42:28,401 --> 01:42:32,487
So... what the captain did...

1324
01:42:32,572 --> 01:42:35,157
...he strapped a cannon
to Bootstrap's bootstraps.

1325
01:42:35,241 --> 01:42:36,741
Bootstrap's bootstraps!

1326
01:42:36,784 --> 01:42:39,786
Last we saw of ol' Bill Turner...

1327
01:42:39,871 --> 01:42:42,330
...he was sinking to
the crushin' black oblivion

1328
01:42:42,415 --> 01:42:45,542
of Davy Jones' locker!

1329
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:49,045
'Course it was only after that
we learned we needed his blood

1330
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:50,297
to lift the curse.

1331
01:42:50,381 --> 01:42:53,425
That's what you'd call ironic.

1332
01:42:57,597 --> 01:42:59,222
Bring him!

1333
01:43:06,439 --> 01:43:08,440
l don't care for the situation.

1334
01:43:08,983 --> 01:43:12,068
Any attempt to stall in the caves
could turn into an ambush.

1335
01:43:12,111 --> 01:43:15,447
Not if you're the one
doing the ambushing.

1336
01:43:15,531 --> 01:43:19,201
l go in and convince Barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats.

1337
01:43:19,285 --> 01:43:22,120
You and your men return to the Dauntless

1338
01:43:22,163 --> 01:43:25,415
and blast the bejesus out of them
with your little cannons.

1339
01:43:25,458 --> 01:43:26,708
What do you have to lose?

1340
01:43:27,793 --> 01:43:30,295
Nothing l'd lament being rid of.

1341
01:43:31,964 --> 01:43:33,840
Now, to be quite honest with you,

1342
01:43:33,925 --> 01:43:36,885
there's still a slight risk
to those aboard the Dauntless,

1343
01:43:36,969 --> 01:43:40,764
which includes
the future Mrs Commodore.

1344
01:43:40,806 --> 01:43:43,892
- Sorry, but it's for your own safety.
- Don't care what the Commodore ordered!

1345
01:43:43,976 --> 01:43:44,976
l have to tell him!

1346
01:43:45,019 --> 01:43:48,021
The pirates! They're cursed!
They can't be killed!

1347
01:43:48,105 --> 01:43:50,649
Don't worry, miss.
He's already informed of that.

1348
01:43:50,691 --> 01:43:54,402
A little mermaid flopped up on deck
and told him the whole story!

1349
01:43:54,487 --> 01:43:56,571
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!

1350
01:44:08,042 --> 01:44:09,501
No reason to fret.

1351
01:44:09,585 --> 01:44:12,170
Just a prick of the finger,
a few drops of blood...

1352
01:44:12,213 --> 01:44:14,214
No mistakes this time.

1353
01:44:14,298 --> 01:44:16,007
He's only half Turner.

1354
01:44:16,092 --> 01:44:17,509
We spill it all!

1355
01:44:19,929 --> 01:44:21,763
Guess there is reason to fret.

1356
01:44:35,695 --> 01:44:37,862
Beg your pardon, mate.
Beg your pardon.

1357
01:44:37,947 --> 01:44:39,698
- Begun by blood...
- Excuse me.

1358
01:44:39,782 --> 01:44:42,492
By blood un...

1359
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:45,870
Jack!

1360
01:44:46,914 --> 01:44:47,998
lt's not possible!

1361
01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:50,208
Not probable.

1362
01:44:50,251 --> 01:44:52,043
Where's Elizabeth?

1363
01:44:53,421 --> 01:44:55,672
She's safe, just like l promised.

1364
01:44:55,715 --> 01:44:58,675
She's all set to marry Norrington,
just like she promised,

1365
01:44:58,718 --> 01:45:01,094
and you get to die for her,
just like you promised.

1366
01:45:01,178 --> 01:45:03,305
So we're all men of our word, really.

1367
01:45:03,389 --> 01:45:06,683
Except for Elizabeth,
who is, in fact, a woman.

1368
01:45:06,726 --> 01:45:08,143
Shut up! You're next!

1369
01:45:11,731 --> 01:45:14,566
You don't want to be doing that, mate.

1370
01:45:14,608 --> 01:45:16,568
No, l really think l do.

1371
01:45:18,362 --> 01:45:20,238
Your funeral.

1372
01:45:23,409 --> 01:45:25,410
And why don't l want to be doing it?

1373
01:45:25,453 --> 01:45:27,120
Oh, because...

1374
01:45:28,122 --> 01:45:30,457
Because the HMS Dauntless,

1375
01:45:30,541 --> 01:45:32,959
the pride of the Royal Navy,

1376
01:45:33,044 --> 01:45:36,296
is floating just off shore,

1377
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:38,089
waiting for you.

1378
01:45:46,265 --> 01:45:47,432
What we doing here?

1379
01:45:49,352 --> 01:45:52,771
The pirates come out,
unprepared and unawares.

1380
01:45:52,813 --> 01:45:54,898
We catch 'em in a crossfire,

1381
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:57,776
and send 'em down to see Old Hob.

1382
01:45:59,070 --> 01:46:01,446
l know why we're here. l meant...

1383
01:46:01,530 --> 01:46:03,406
...why aren't we doing what it was...

1384
01:46:03,449 --> 01:46:05,283
What Mr Sparrow said we should do?

1385
01:46:05,326 --> 01:46:06,826
With the cannons and all?

1386
01:46:06,911 --> 01:46:09,954
Because it was Mr Sparrow who said it.

1387
01:46:12,583 --> 01:46:15,168
You think he wasn't telling the truth?

1388
01:46:15,252 --> 01:46:17,128
Just hear me out, mate.

1389
01:46:17,213 --> 01:46:20,965
Your order your men to row out to the
Dauntless, they do what they do best...

1390
01:46:22,051 --> 01:46:26,471
Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt.
There you are with two ships.

1391
01:46:26,555 --> 01:46:28,973
The makings of your very own fleet.

1392
01:46:29,058 --> 01:46:32,644
'Course, you'll take the grandest
as your flagship, and who's to argue?

1393
01:46:32,728 --> 01:46:34,145
But what of the Pearl?

1394
01:46:35,773 --> 01:46:37,107
Name me captain.

1395
01:46:37,149 --> 01:46:40,610
l'll sail under your colours,
l'll give you ten percent of me plunder,

1396
01:46:40,653 --> 01:46:42,862
and you'll get to
introduce yourself as...

1397
01:46:43,447 --> 01:46:46,324
...Commodore Barbossa.

1398
01:46:46,367 --> 01:46:47,450
Savvy?

1399
01:46:47,493 --> 01:46:49,702
l suppose, in exchange, you

1400
01:46:49,787 --> 01:46:52,622
- want me not to kill the whelp.
- No. Not at all!

1401
01:46:52,665 --> 01:46:54,332
By all means, kill the whelp!

1402
01:46:54,375 --> 01:46:56,793
Just not yet.

1403
01:46:56,836 --> 01:46:59,003
Wait to lift the curse

1404
01:46:59,046 --> 01:47:01,714
until the opportune moment.

1405
01:47:05,177 --> 01:47:06,803
For instance...

1406
01:47:08,681 --> 01:47:11,933
...after you've killed Norrington's men.

1407
01:47:12,017 --> 01:47:13,601
Every...

1408
01:47:13,686 --> 01:47:15,353
...last...

1409
01:47:15,396 --> 01:47:16,855
...one.

1410
01:47:26,490 --> 01:47:28,825
You've been planning this
from the beginning!

1411
01:47:28,868 --> 01:47:30,452
Ever since you learned my name!

1412
01:47:31,287 --> 01:47:32,287
Yeah.

1413
01:47:34,623 --> 01:47:36,749
l want 50 percent of your plunder.

1414
01:47:36,834 --> 01:47:37,834
- 15!
- 40!

1415
01:47:37,877 --> 01:47:38,877
25!

1416
01:47:40,045 --> 01:47:41,379
And l'll buy you the hat.

1417
01:47:41,422 --> 01:47:43,423
A really big one.

1418
01:47:44,216 --> 01:47:45,383
Commodore.

1419
01:47:48,512 --> 01:47:49,721
We have an accord.

1420
01:47:51,390 --> 01:47:53,683
All hands to the boats!

1421
01:47:54,685 --> 01:47:55,810
Apologies.

1422
01:47:55,895 --> 01:47:57,562
You give the orders.

1423
01:47:58,898 --> 01:47:59,898
Gents...

1424
01:48:00,900 --> 01:48:02,275
...take a walk!

1425
01:48:07,114 --> 01:48:08,448
Not to the boats?

1426
01:49:07,841 --> 01:49:10,760
Hold fire!

1427
01:49:12,805 --> 01:49:15,598
This is just like what
the Greeks done at Troy!

1428
01:49:16,976 --> 01:49:18,601
'Cept they was in a horse,

1429
01:49:18,644 --> 01:49:20,103
instead of dresses.

1430
01:49:20,813 --> 01:49:22,188
Wooden horse.

1431
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:36,160
A moment, please.

1432
01:49:40,332 --> 01:49:41,332
Elizabeth?

1433
01:49:44,587 --> 01:49:46,379
l just want you to know, l...

1434
01:49:47,506 --> 01:49:49,966
l believe you made a very
good decision today.

1435
01:49:50,801 --> 01:49:52,802
Couldn't be more proud of you!

1436
01:49:53,304 --> 01:49:54,429
But, you know,

1437
01:49:54,513 --> 01:49:57,432
even a good decision,
if made for the wrong reasons,

1438
01:49:57,516 --> 01:49:59,017
can be a wrong decision.

1439
01:50:08,027 --> 01:50:09,027
Lieutenant.

1440
01:50:28,213 --> 01:50:29,380
Elizabeth?

1441
01:50:31,550 --> 01:50:32,800
Are you there?

1442
01:50:35,054 --> 01:50:37,680
Elizabeth, are you even listening to me?

1443
01:51:04,792 --> 01:51:06,876
What have you done?

1444
01:51:07,836 --> 01:51:10,505
Stop that!
l already feel like a fool!

1445
01:51:11,548 --> 01:51:12,924
Look nice, though.

1446
01:51:17,429 --> 01:51:19,847
Do l look nice now?!

1447
01:51:55,801 --> 01:51:57,051
l must admit, Jack.

1448
01:51:57,136 --> 01:51:59,053
l thought l had you figured.

1449
01:51:59,138 --> 01:52:02,306
But it turns out you're
a hard man to predict.

1450
01:52:02,391 --> 01:52:04,350
Me, l'm dishonest.

1451
01:52:04,435 --> 01:52:07,270
And a dishonest man you can
always trust to be dishonest.

1452
01:52:07,312 --> 01:52:08,563
Honestly...

1453
01:52:08,647 --> 01:52:11,274
...it's the honest ones
you want to watch out for.

1454
01:52:11,316 --> 01:52:13,609
'Cause you can never predict

1455
01:52:13,652 --> 01:52:16,946
when they're going to do
something incredibly...

1456
01:52:16,989 --> 01:52:17,989
...stupid.

1457
01:52:51,315 --> 01:52:53,357
You're off the edge of the map, mate.

1458
01:52:53,442 --> 01:52:55,485
Here, there be monsters!

1459
01:53:00,365 --> 01:53:01,699
Right.

1460
01:53:03,368 --> 01:53:05,453
What would you pick to eat first?

1461
01:53:05,537 --> 01:53:07,455
l think we should decide now,

1462
01:53:07,539 --> 01:53:09,707
just so we're ready when the time comes!

1463
01:53:34,775 --> 01:53:35,900
What was that?

1464
01:53:58,841 --> 01:53:59,841
It's Elizabeth!

1465
01:54:20,445 --> 01:54:22,113
Make for the ship! Move!

1466
01:55:15,709 --> 01:55:17,460
You can't beat me, Jack.

1467
01:55:41,860 --> 01:55:43,277
That's interesting!

1468
01:55:54,164 --> 01:55:56,082
l couldn't resist, mate.

1469
01:57:02,441 --> 01:57:03,649
Sorry!

1470
01:57:12,743 --> 01:57:14,410
So, what now, Jack Sparrow?

1471
01:57:14,453 --> 01:57:17,204
Are we to be two immortals,
locked in an epic battle

1472
01:57:17,289 --> 01:57:19,999
until Judgment Day,
and the trumpets sound?

1473
01:57:20,667 --> 01:57:22,084
Or you could surrender.

1474
01:57:49,404 --> 01:57:50,613
All of you with me!

1475
01:57:50,655 --> 01:57:52,740
Will is in that cave,
and we must save him!

1476
01:57:52,824 --> 01:57:55,409
Ready, and... heave!

1477
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,043
Please, l need your help! Come on!

1478
01:58:05,003 --> 01:58:06,837
Any port in a storm.

1479
01:58:06,922 --> 01:58:09,006
Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl!

1480
01:58:09,091 --> 01:58:11,342
What about Jack?
Are you just gonna leave him?

1481
01:58:11,426 --> 01:58:13,219
Jack owes us a ship!

1482
01:58:13,303 --> 01:58:14,845
There's the code to consider.

1483
01:58:15,430 --> 01:58:16,555
The code?

1484
01:58:18,308 --> 01:58:20,768
You're pirates!
Hang the code

1485
01:58:20,852 --> 01:58:22,520
and hang the rules!

1486
01:58:22,562 --> 01:58:24,980
They're more like guidelines, anyway.

1487
01:58:28,777 --> 01:58:30,945
Bloody pirates!

1488
01:58:40,150 --> 01:58:42,090
-Hey.
-What?

1489
01:58:42,374 --> 01:58:44,542
ls it supposed to be doing that?

1490
01:58:44,626 --> 01:58:46,836
They're stealing our ship!

1491
01:58:47,295 --> 01:58:48,963
Bloody pirates!

1492
01:58:51,049 --> 01:58:52,883
Boarders away!

1493
01:59:01,101 --> 01:59:03,102
Come on!

1494
01:59:29,004 --> 01:59:30,337
Me eye!

1495
01:59:50,275 --> 01:59:52,359
l'm gonna teach you the meaning of pain!

1496
01:59:52,444 --> 01:59:54,028
You like pain?

1497
01:59:55,822 --> 01:59:57,198
Try wearing a corset.

1498
02:00:07,584 --> 02:00:09,210
Whose side is Jack on?

1499
02:00:09,294 --> 02:00:12,338
At the moment?

1500
02:00:47,290 --> 02:00:48,415
No fair!

1501
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:14,275
Ten years you carry that pistol,

1502
02:01:14,359 --> 02:01:16,694
and now you waste your shot!

1503
02:01:17,696 --> 02:01:20,656
He didn't waste it.

1504
02:01:45,307 --> 02:01:46,807
l feel...

1505
02:01:51,396 --> 02:01:52,688
...cold.

1506
02:02:54,959 --> 02:02:57,419
Parley?

1507
02:02:57,462 --> 02:02:59,338
The ship is ours, gentlemen.

1508
02:02:59,422 --> 02:03:01,882
Huzzah! Huzzah!

1509
02:03:10,600 --> 02:03:11,600
Huzzah!

1510
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:50,013
We should return to the Dauntless.

1511
02:03:52,559 --> 02:03:56,186
Your fiancé will be wanting
to know you're safe.

1512
02:04:05,864 --> 02:04:09,158
lf you were waiting for
the opportune moment...

1513
02:04:10,160 --> 02:04:11,493
...that was it.

1514
02:04:12,954 --> 02:04:15,122
Now if you'd be so kind,
l'd be much obliged

1515
02:04:15,206 --> 02:04:18,041
if you'd drop me off at my ship.

1516
02:04:22,630 --> 02:04:24,798
l'm sorry, Jack.

1517
02:04:26,718 --> 02:04:28,927
They done what's right by them.

1518
02:04:29,012 --> 02:04:30,762
Can't expect more than that.

1519
02:04:46,362 --> 02:04:47,696
Jack Sparrow!

1520
02:04:47,739 --> 02:04:51,825
- We have learned that you...
- Captain! Captain Jack Sparrow.

1521
02:04:52,535 --> 02:04:55,787
...for your wilful commission
of crimes against the crown.

1522
02:04:55,872 --> 02:04:59,583
Said crimes being numerous in quantity,

1523
02:04:59,667 --> 02:05:01,210
and sinister in nature.

1524
02:05:01,878 --> 02:05:03,378
The most egregious of these

1525
02:05:03,421 --> 02:05:05,631
to be cited herewith:

1526
02:05:05,715 --> 02:05:09,468
- Piracy, smuggling...
- This is wrong.

1527
02:05:10,470 --> 02:05:13,472
Commodore Norrington
is bound by the law,

1528
02:05:13,556 --> 02:05:16,099
as are we all.

1529
02:05:16,142 --> 02:05:18,852
...impersonating an officer
of the Spanish Royal Navy,

1530
02:05:18,937 --> 02:05:22,022
impersonating a cleric
of the Church of England...

1531
02:05:22,106 --> 02:05:23,232
Oh, yes!

1532
02:05:23,274 --> 02:05:25,275
Sailing under false colours,

1533
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:29,571
arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching,

1534
02:05:29,614 --> 02:05:35,577
brigandage, pilfering,
depravity, depredation,

1535
02:05:35,620 --> 02:05:37,454
and general lawlessness.

1536
02:05:38,831 --> 02:05:40,499
And for these crimes,

1537
02:05:40,583 --> 02:05:43,126
you have been sentenced to be,
on this day,

1538
02:05:43,169 --> 02:05:46,922
hung by the neck, until dead.

1539
02:05:46,965 --> 02:05:49,258
May God have mercy on your soul.

1540
02:05:49,300 --> 02:05:50,842
Governor Swann.

1541
02:05:50,927 --> 02:05:52,844
Commodore.

1542
02:05:54,347 --> 02:05:55,347
Elizabeth.

1543
02:05:56,808 --> 02:05:59,643
l should've told you every day,
from the moment l met you.

1544
02:06:01,479 --> 02:06:03,981
l love you.

1545
02:06:18,538 --> 02:06:20,289
Boy, watch yourself!

1546
02:06:20,331 --> 02:06:21,456
Marines!

1547
02:06:21,499 --> 02:06:23,041
l can't breathe!

1548
02:06:24,961 --> 02:06:25,961
Elizabeth!

1549
02:06:28,965 --> 02:06:30,007
Move!

1550
02:06:40,893 --> 02:06:43,103
You men! With me!

1551
02:06:54,150 --> 02:06:55,740
Move!

1552
02:07:05,350 --> 02:07:06,226
Come on!

1553
02:07:17,096 --> 02:07:18,096
Come on, men!

1554
02:07:43,706 --> 02:07:47,709
l thought we might have to endure some
manner of ill-conceived escape attempt.

1555
02:07:48,544 --> 02:07:50,128
But not from you.

1556
02:07:50,213 --> 02:07:51,588
On our return to Port Royal,

1557
02:07:51,673 --> 02:07:54,049
l granted you clemency.

1558
02:07:54,092 --> 02:07:55,759
And this is how you thank me?

1559
02:07:55,802 --> 02:07:57,886
By throwing in your lot with him?

1560
02:07:57,929 --> 02:07:59,513
He's a pirate!

1561
02:07:59,597 --> 02:08:01,556
And a good man.

1562
02:08:02,350 --> 02:08:04,601
lf all l've achieved here
is that the hangman

1563
02:08:04,644 --> 02:08:06,770
will own two pairs
of boots instead of one,

1564
02:08:06,854 --> 02:08:08,480
so be it.

1565
02:08:08,564 --> 02:08:10,440
At least my conscience will be clear.

1566
02:08:10,483 --> 02:08:13,443
You forget your place, Turner.

1567
02:08:14,987 --> 02:08:16,613
lt's right here,

1568
02:08:16,656 --> 02:08:18,115
between you and Jack.

1569
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:23,787
As is mine.

1570
02:08:23,871 --> 02:08:25,247
Elizabeth!

1571
02:08:26,708 --> 02:08:27,874
Lower your weapons.

1572
02:08:28,668 --> 02:08:30,669
For goodness sake, put them down!

1573
02:08:35,758 --> 02:08:38,677
So this is where
your heart truly lies, then.

1574
02:08:40,304 --> 02:08:41,805
lt is.

1575
02:08:50,314 --> 02:08:54,192
Well! l'm actually feeling
rather good about this.

1576
02:08:54,277 --> 02:08:56,778
l think we've all arrived
at a very special place.

1577
02:08:56,821 --> 02:08:57,904
Spiritually.

1578
02:08:57,989 --> 02:08:59,990
Ecumenically.

1579
02:09:00,074 --> 02:09:01,283
Grammatically.

1580
02:09:02,744 --> 02:09:05,328
l want you to know that
l was rooting for you, mate.

1581
02:09:06,622 --> 02:09:07,622
Know that.

1582
02:09:11,627 --> 02:09:13,128
Elizabeth.

1583
02:09:15,089 --> 02:09:17,674
lt would never have worked
between us, darling.

1584
02:09:19,135 --> 02:09:21,011
l'm sorry.

1585
02:09:23,139 --> 02:09:24,139
Will!

1586
02:09:26,434 --> 02:09:28,101
Nice hat.

1587
02:09:30,062 --> 02:09:31,646
Friends!

1588
02:09:33,566 --> 02:09:36,359
This the day that you will always

1589
02:09:36,402 --> 02:09:39,029
remember as the day that...

1590
02:09:43,993 --> 02:09:46,661
ldiot! He's nowhere to go
but back to the noose!

1591
02:09:49,081 --> 02:09:50,916
Sail ho!

1592
02:09:58,466 --> 02:10:01,092
What's your plan of action?

1593
02:10:01,844 --> 02:10:02,844
Sir?

1594
02:10:07,225 --> 02:10:09,684
Perhaps on the rare occasion

1595
02:10:09,727 --> 02:10:13,605
pursuing the right course
demands an act of piracy,

1596
02:10:13,689 --> 02:10:17,484
piracy itself can be the right course?

1597
02:10:21,739 --> 02:10:23,031
Mr Turner!

1598
02:10:29,121 --> 02:10:31,957
l will accept the consequences
of my actions.

1599
02:10:37,922 --> 02:10:39,548
This is a beautiful sword.

1600
02:10:42,009 --> 02:10:43,760
l would expect the man who made it

1601
02:10:43,803 --> 02:10:48,598
to show the same care and devotion
in every aspect of his life.

1602
02:10:50,643 --> 02:10:52,394
Thank you.

1603
02:10:55,273 --> 02:10:56,314
Commodore!

1604
02:10:56,399 --> 02:10:58,108
What about Sparrow?

1605
02:11:00,027 --> 02:11:02,946
Oh, l think we can afford
to give him one day's head start.

1606
02:11:09,170 --> 02:11:10,000
So.

1607
02:11:12,206 --> 02:11:15,292
This is the path you've chosen, is it?

1608
02:11:16,669 --> 02:11:18,962
After all...

1609
02:11:19,005 --> 02:11:20,547
...he is a blacksmith.

1610
02:11:21,549 --> 02:11:22,799
No.

1611
02:11:27,513 --> 02:11:29,806
He's a pirate.

1612
02:11:53,998 --> 02:11:55,665
Heave!

1613
02:12:06,052 --> 02:12:08,637
Thought you were supposed
to keep to the code.

1614
02:12:08,679 --> 02:12:11,348
We figured they were more actual...

1615
02:12:11,432 --> 02:12:13,391
...guidelines.

1616
02:12:17,521 --> 02:12:19,230
Thank you.

1617
02:12:20,358 --> 02:12:21,733
Captain Sparrow.

1618
02:12:26,030 --> 02:12:27,614
The Black Pearl is yours!

1619
02:12:43,422 --> 02:12:45,090
On deck, you scabrous dogs!

1620
02:12:45,174 --> 02:12:46,633
Hands to braces!

1621
02:12:46,717 --> 02:12:48,969
Let go and haul to run free.

1622
02:12:50,638 --> 02:12:52,430
Now...

1623
02:12:52,515 --> 02:12:54,349
Bring me that horizon.

1624
02:13:01,649 --> 02:13:03,733
</i>And really bad eggs</i>

1625
02:13:07,071 --> 02:13:09,572
</i>Drink up, me hearties. Yo ho!</i>
