Dr. Andrews, did you see that?

23
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,194
The habitat's not gonna
hold much longer.

24
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:15,947
We need to start thinking
about off-site solutions.

25
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,449
The island is the one thing
that's kept him isolated.

26
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,409
If he leaves,
Godzilla will come for him.

27

There can't be two alpha Titans.

28
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,499

Off-site would be
a death sentence.

Something bad is going on here.

I don't know what it is,

72
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:44,321

and download hard evidence

73
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,824
and expose a
vast corporate conspiracy.

74
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,910
Yeah, you can call me a whistleblower,
But I ain't just whistling.

75
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:53,372
I mean, this is more than a leak.
It's a flood.

76
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:58,085
And believe me, this flood
is gonna wash away all of Apex's lies.

77

It's incredibly unhealthy.

00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,564
It's just all the GMOs.

94
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:03,192
Growing a second head

You have to let me know.

I can barely handle

97
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,614
Bernie, you're not
supposed to be in here.

98
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,951

I mean, really doing here.

100
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,288
Why are you here?
This isn't Engineering.

101
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,415
Because, you know, I had to wait

102
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:19,750
because they're rendering
these new specs,

103
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,502

104
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:22,962
That's calculator mode.

00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,713
...over one hour, maybe even more.

106
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,799
So my foreman told me
to just take a walk

107
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:29,343
- and make some new friends.
- Oh.

108
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,679
Oh! Now that we're new friends,
I can share something with you, right?

109
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:33,847
I know it's in here somewhere.

110
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:35,683
This is hand sanitizer that
I made from my own garden.

111
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,059
It's really amazing.

112
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,769
Don't know if I used that or not.

113
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,107
Yes. This. Check this out.

118
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,616
It's from a toaster.
Look at this thing.

119
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,368
I have to go to the bathroom.

120
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,371
Is it one or two? 'Cause if it's two,
it's probably from these apples.

121
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,873
Hey, you wanna use the
hand sanitizer that I made?

122
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,250
I'm good.

123
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,836

177
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,494
<i>Oh, my God. I was there.</i>

178
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:08,330
<i>Godzilla's Apex attack.
I saw it go down!</i>

179
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,582
<i>You think it's a coincidence
that he reappears</i>

180
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,418
<i>and just so happens to
destroy that specific facility?</i>

181
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:16,922
<i>Ha-ha, no, no, no, no.
No such thing as coincidence.</i>

MONARCH RELIEF CAMP
PENSACOLA, FLORIDA

183
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,347
Dad, I'm telling you,
there's something
provoking him

184
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,640
that we're not seeing here.

185
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,017
Why else would Godzilla
flash an intimidation display

186
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,561
if there wasn't
another Titan around?

187
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,771
That podcast is filling
your head with garbage.

188
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,566
- You should be in school.
- I am just trying to help.

189
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,734
I don't want you to help.
I want you to stay safe.

190
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,736
We needed a plan to keep peace
with these things,

191
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,947
and the best one we had
just went down in flames.

192
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,156
I don't have any more.

193
00:13:43,282 --> 00:13:45,742
And the last thing that I need
is to be worrying about you.

194
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:48,745
Godzilla saved us. You were
there with Mom. You saw it.

195
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,289
How could you doubt him?

196
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:51,999
- There has to be a pattern.
- There doesn't.

197
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:54,001
- A reason why he was provoked.
- There isn't.

198
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,085
How do you know that?

199
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,337
Because creatures,
like people, can change.

200
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:58,714
And right now,
Godzilla's out there

201
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,340
and he's hurting people,
and we don't know why.

202
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,468
So cut your pop
some slack, would ya?

203
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,014
See you at home, Dad.

204
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,769
<i>You wanna know my theory?</i>

205
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,980
<i>I mean, of course you do.
That's why you're here.</i>

206
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:17,566
<i>Come on, it's all about
patterns and variables.</i>

207
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,318
<i>Oh, wait, stick with me.
I'm gonna take you back</i>

208
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,694
<i>to sixth grade with this, okay?</i>

209
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:23,614
<i>Godzilla attacks when provoked,
that's the pattern.</i>

210
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:27,326
<i>Pensacola is the
only coastal Apex hub</i>
<i>with an advanced robotics lab.</i>

211
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,452
<i>That's the variable.</i>

212
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,621
<i>And add them up
and your answer is</i>

213
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,040
<i>that Apex is at the heart
of the problem.</i>

DENHAM UNIVERSITY OF THEORETICAL SCIENCE
PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA

215
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,516
Can I help you?

216
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:56,688
If you want an appointment,
my office hours are nine to five.

217
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,899
- Please, Dr. Lind.
- What the f...

218
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:03,695
Guys like you and me,
we don't do normal hours, do we?

219
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,690
HOLLOW EARTH

220
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:09,451
I've been fixated on Hollow Earth
for as long as you have.

221
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:13,789
Your theory that it's
the birthplace of all Titans is fascinating.

222
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:16,124
Your book was very impressive.

223
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,002
Oh, yeah? Well, I got about
30 unsold boxes

224
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,545
in my apartment if you want some.

225
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,048
Walt Simmons.

226
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,759
I know who you are, sir.
It's an honor.

227
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:29,471
No, the honor is mine.
As is the urgency.

228
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,808
Godzilla has never attacked us
unprovoked before.

229
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,143
These are dangerous times,
Dr. Lind.

230
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,020
Allow me to introduce

231
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:40,357
our Apex chief technology
officer, Mr. Ren Serizawa.

232
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,319
He has an interesting thing
to show you.

233
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,077
Magnetic imaging from
one of our new satellites.

234
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,705
You know what this is, right?

235
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,707
Hollow Earth.

236
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:00,001
An ecosystem as vast as any ocean,

237
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,420
right beneath our feet.

238
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,051
This energy signal is enormous.

239
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:11,555
And almost identical
to readings from <i>Gojira.</i>

240
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,890
As our sun
fuels the planet's surface,

241
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,351
this energy sustains
the Hollow Earth,

242
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:20,731
enabling life as powerful as
our aggressive Titan friend.

243
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:24,109
If we can harness
this life force,

244
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:27,070
we'll have a weapon that can
compete with Godzilla.

245
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,906
I need your help to find it.

246
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,495
I don't know if I'm
the right guy for the job.

247
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,664
Did you read the reviews?

248
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:40,917
"A sci-fi quack
trading in fringe physics."

249
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,794
Look where they put my office.

250
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:45,213
I'm in the basement
right across from flute class.

251
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:48,633
Besides, I'm not
with Monarch anymore.

252
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,178
And Hollow Earth entry
is impossible.

253
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,221
We tried.

254
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,268
I'm sorry about your brother.

255
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,104
He was a true pioneer.

256
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:02,439
Thanks.

257
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:09,571
See, all of our forward scans

258
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:12,949
suggest a habitable
environment down there.

259
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:18,371
So, what really went wrong
on your brother's mission?

260
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,293
When they tried to enter,

261
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,421
they hit a gravitational inversion.

262
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:31,218
A whole planet's worth of gravity
reversed in a split second.

263
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,972
They were crushed in an instant.

264
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:41,478
What if I told you
that we, at Apex,

265
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:46,191
have created a phenomenal craft
which could sustain such an inversion?

266
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,446
The Hollow Earth Aerial Vehicle.

267
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,240
HEAV.

268
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:59,955
We can make the journey
to Hollow Earth possible,
Dr. Lind.

269
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,332
But we need you
to lead the mission.

270
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,173
Help me.

271
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,468
Help everyone.

272
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:19,140
Finding this needle in a haystack
is our best shot against Godzilla.

273
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,853
Well, I, uh, might have an idea.

274
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:24,771
But it's crazy.

275
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:28,525
I love crazy ideas.
They made me rich.

276
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,487
Are you guys familiar
with genetic memory?

277
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,657
It's a theory that all Titans
share a common impulse

278
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,158
to return to
their evolutionary source.

279
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,119
Like spawning salmon.

280
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:43,123
Exactly. Or a...
Or a homing pigeon.

281
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,625
So if this is the Titans' home

282
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,878
and this life force
sustains them...

283
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,671
A Titan could show you the way.

284
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:52,465
Yeah.

285
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,427
With a little help
of an old colleague.

286
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:59,760
SCIENTIFIC FUTURE

287
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:30,712
Ugh, where is it?

288
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:31,796
<i>Dr. Andrews,</i>

289
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,299
<i>you have a visitor
waiting for you at security.</i>

290
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,223
Okay.

291
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,300
YOURE NERVOUS.

292
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,980
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

293
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,980
YOU CAN'T LIE TO ME.

294
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,520
I'M NOT A KID ANYMORE.

295
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,324
A power source
in Hollow Earth?

296
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,576
This sounds nuts, Nathan,
even for you.

297
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,537
It's there! We just need
Kong to bring us to it!

298
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,123
The second you take
Kong out of containment,

299
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,416
Godzilla's gonna come for him.

300
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,293
You said you can't
keep him here forever.

301
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:13,380
No. Our meddling has
already wreaked havoc
on Kong's habitat.

302
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,048
No way am I letting you drag him

303
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,758
halfway across the world
to use him as a weapon.

304
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,177
No, not as a weapon.
As an ally.

305
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,304
To protect us,
lead the way down there.

306
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,598
What even makes you think
that he'll go in?

307
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,475
You always believed
that Skull Island

308
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,936
was like Hollow Earth
come to the surface, right?

309
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,604
And that's where Kong's
ancestors came from.

310
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:30,689
Mm-hmm.

311
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:33,775
Through the entrance in Antarctica,
we could help him find a new home.

312
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,027
And he could save ours.

313
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:37,988
Hers.

314
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,991
That power source
may be our only hope.

315
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,868
We gotta stop Godzilla.
This is our only chance.

316
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,287
We have to take it.

317
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,140
- Okay.
- Yes!

318
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:08,309
But when it comes to Kong,
what I say goes.

319
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,437
You name the terms. Thank you.

320
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,399
Sorry. Thank you.

321
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:16,735
You won't regret this.

322
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,320
- Mm, I already regret this.

323
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,150
THIS IS HIS HOME...

324
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,320
...OURS.

325
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,410
OUR HOME...

326
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,990
...IS TOGETHER.

327
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,910
YOU AND ME.

328
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,009

Well, he can smell you, too.

340
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,040
Still not a fan, huh?

341
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,540
COWARD.

342
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,005
What's she saying?

343
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:03,842
Just an Iwi expression.

344
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:05,343

that you're very brave.

00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,511
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

346
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,099
Hey, use a light touch
on the sedatives.

347
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:12,559
He's our escort.

348
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:15,103
We can't have him comatose
when we reach Hollow Earth.

349
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,188
What if Kong
doesn't go willingly?

350
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:19,023
- What do you do then?

351
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:22,402
<i>Dr. Lind, please report</i>
<i>to the forward deck. Dr. Lind.</i>

352
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:23,570
Excuse me.

353
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,490
New arrivals.

354
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,360
COWARD.

355
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:50,805
Welcome.

356
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:57,687
Wow. Who's the idiot
who came up with this idea?

357
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,315
- Ha-ha.
- I'm Maia Simmons.

358
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:01,441
My father sent me.

359
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:03,026
I run point for Apex.

360
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,777
Nathan Lind, mission chief.

361
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:09,866
Yeah, don't worry.
I'm just here to babysit.

362
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,705
The Hollow Earth
Aerial Vehicles
are on their way to Antarctica
as we speak.

363
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,166
I know you people
think you're cutting-edge,

364
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,834
but these prototypes
we're loaning you

365
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:23,296
will make what you've been
flying look like used Miatas.

366
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:24,589
I love Miatas.

367
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:27,217
Forget about the price tag,
which is obscene, of course.

368
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:29,135
The antigravity engines
alone produce

369
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,346
enough charge
to light up Vegas for a week.

370
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,557
Feel free to be impressed.

371
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:36,643
Wow.

372
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:52,492
All right, we'll be
at the Antarctica entry
in 48 hours.

373
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:55,411
This path will get us
into Hollow Earth.

374
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:59,874
Once we're inside, Kong should
lead us to the power source.

375
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:02,961
Now, the gravitational inversion
will be quite intense.

376
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:06,506
Our best guess is that on entry,
it'll feel like bungee jumping...

377
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:08,758
with the cord tied to
your lower intestine.

378
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,927
But if your helicopters
are as good as you say...

379
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,178
HEAVs.

380
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,681
If your HEAVs are as good
as you say they are,

381
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:16,599
I believe we can do this.

382
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:18,142
They'll do the job.

383
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,603
You just gotta do yours.

384
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:22,355
Excellent.

385
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:25,775
Dr. Andrews.

386
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:29,487
We've avoided all of Godzilla's
known territorial waters

387
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,822
according to your guidelines.

388
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,240
Good.

389
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:33,449
Do I need to be concerned?

390
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,618
Yes. They do have a way
of sensing threats.

391
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:38,079
And we believe that they
had an ancient rivalry.

392
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:41,040
The myths say that their ancestors
fought each other in a great war.

393
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:44,377
So if they meet again,
who bows to who, is that it?

394
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:47,880
No, I spent 10 years on
that island studying him.

395
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:50,508
I know this for sure.

396
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,011
Kong bows to no one.

397
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,144
Is she supposed to be out there?

398
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:49,919
Jia, come on. Come on.

399
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,290
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

400
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,750
IT'S NOT SAFE OUT HERE.

401
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,470
KONG IS SAD.

402
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,760
AND ANGRY

403
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,350
THAT'S BECAUSE HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.

404
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,470
WE WANT TO HELP HIM.

405
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,480
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT.

406
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,610
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

407
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,150
HE TOLD ME.

408
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,950
HOME.

409
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,250
HOME.

410
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:47,518
Did the monkey just talk?

411
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:54,400
<i>Okay, class, listen up.</i>

412
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,613
<i>In the midst of Godzilla's
attack on Apex Pensacola,</i>

413
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:02,033
<i>I found some crazy tech with
no official classification.</i>

414
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:04,202
<i>What I saw doesn't match</i>

415
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:06,078
<i>any of the engineering specs
I've ever seen.</i>

416
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,373
<i>So what are they working on
in such blackout secrecy, hmm?</i>

417
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:11,667
<i>This could be the thread
that finally unravels</i>

418
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,419
<i>the Apex sweater of conspiracy.</i>

419
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:15,254
<i>You better believe
I'm gonna keep tugging.</i>

420
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,423
<i>For now, I'm secure.</i>

421
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:20,301
<i>Anonymous and hiding in plain sight</i>
<i>as I continue my mission.</i>

422
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:25,848
<i>♪ Breaking the law
Breaking the law ♪</i>

423
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,477
<i>♪ Breaking the law
Breaking the law ♪</i>

424
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:38,361
To be clear, my brother can
never know we took his van.

425
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:40,696
Josh, to be clear, even if
we got into an accident,

426
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,781
I don't think he could tell.

427
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:44,075
No, no, my brother would
never let you drive either.

428
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:45,243
My mission, my wheel.

429
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:46,619
I just don't think
it's a good idea,

430
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,746
looking for some secret weirdo
off the Internet.

431
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:51,123
I mean, we just had
an assembly about this.

432
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:53,584
He's not a weirdo.
He's a covert investigator.

433
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,461
And he's the only one
looking for the truth

434
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:57,046
about Godzilla and Apex.

435
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,715
So let him look.
Why do we have to help him?

436
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:00,967
Because...

437
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,135
If we don't, nobody else will.

438
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:06,222
Are you coming or not?

439
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:08,432
Obviously I'm coming.

440
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,394
It's stuck.

441
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:13,646
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

442
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:26,033
<i>Mind control.
Read up on it, sheep.</i>

443
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:27,785
<i>Psionic link technology
is a reality.</i>

444
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,912
<i>That's right.
One brain controlling another.</i>

445
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:30,997
Oh, man.

446
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,708
<i>Imagine that on a global scale</i>
<i>and Apex is invincible.</i>

447
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,668
We've been listening
to this weirdo for hours.

448
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,461
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

449
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,255
Whoa! Knock it off!

450
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,716
Wait, this is the part
I was telling you about.

451
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,718
<i>...need special UV to even
know you've been marked!</i>

452
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,303
<i>One or two gallons
won't cut it.</i>

453
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:47,763
<i>I need my bleach in bulk!</i>

454
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:50,349
<i>Because spy dust
is real, people!</i>

455
00:30:50,433 --> 00:30:51,976
<i>I mean, come on,
invisible to the naked eye...</i>

456
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:53,603
- That's how we find him.

457
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,438
- The bleach.
- Bleach?

458
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,565
He consumes a ton of bleach.

459
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:58,983
He drinks bleach?

460
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:01,611
Showers with it.

461
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:04,488
Oh! Yeah, I shower
with bleach. No, what?

462
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:07,241
Prevention against
organic tracking technology.

463
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:09,368
See? Tradecraft.

464
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,413
Would've made more sense
if he just drank it.

465
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:20,046
Come on, just one more place.

466
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,298
Madison, this is getting old.

467
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,133
Hey, you sell bleach?

468
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:27,428
Is this another one of those
Internet challenge things?

469
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:29,138
When I sold those kids
those detergent pods,

470
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,890
I didn't know they
were gonna eat them.

471
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:33,100
I'm still dealing with
the lawsuits from that.

472
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:36,103
Look, we're looking for a guy
who works for Apex Cybernetics.

473
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,939
Buys a lot of bleach.
Like every night.

474
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:42,902
He's probably paranoid,
high-strung, doesn't like daylight.

475
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,946
You know, has a lot of
crumbs in his beard, if he has a beard.

476
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,241
Okay, look,
you kids want some candy?
Because I can help you with candy.

477
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:52,787
Look at me in the eye. Okay?
I need information.

478
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:54,163
Yeah, we want lots of candy.

479
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:57,583
What are you doing?
You think...?

480
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,878
Oh, you mean Bernie.

481
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:03,089
Yeah, I know that guy.

482
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:04,632
He buys, like, a ton of bleach.

483
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,092
I know where he is, too.

484
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:08,302
If you buy a live fish,
I'll give you his address.

485
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:12,682
Bernie?

486
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:14,809
Mister... Mis...

487
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,144
Mister Bernie not home.

488
00:32:17,228 --> 00:32:20,356
- Yep, that was definitely Mister Bernie.
- Yeah. Um...

489
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:24,735
Hi! Hi. Listen, we wanna talk
about Apex and Godzilla.

490
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:27,071
No. No. No.

491
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:30,449
I... I got your faces.
I contact authorities. Yes.

492
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:31,951
For knocking on a door?

493
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,327
No. No.

494
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:37,540
Bernie, you don't trust
the authorities.
My name is Madison Russell.

495
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:40,418
My father works for Monarch
and my mother was...

496
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,586
Emma Russell, right?

497
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:47,299
<i>Before we go any farther,
I got one question.</i>

498
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:49,510
Tap or no tap?

499
00:32:49,802 --> 00:32:51,053
No tap.

500
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:53,848
- Excuse me, what is "tap"?
- Water.

501
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:56,267
They put fluoride in it.
Learned it from the Nazis.

502
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,853
Theory is it makes you docile,
easy to manipulate.

503
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:00,479
Oh, I drink tap water.

504
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,023
Yeah, I kind of figured that.

505
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:04,608
But she does the thinking
for both of you,

506
00:33:04,692 --> 00:33:06,193
so it should be all right.

507
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:08,028
- Thanks.
- Okay.

508
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:09,530
What you got?

509
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,076
I believe Godzilla's
most recent attacks
haven't just been random.

510
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:16,287
I think he targeted
the Apex facility.

511
00:33:16,454 --> 00:33:17,830
I'm of the same opinion.

512
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:20,374
But why? What is Apex up to
that's provoking him?

513
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,960
For five years, I embedded
myself inside this company,

514
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:25,004
trying to figure out
what their game was.

515
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:27,131
Then, last week...

516
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:28,716
I saw this.

517
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:33,345
A manifest of huge cargo
being sent from here

518
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:34,722
to Apex headquarters
in Hong Kong,

519
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:38,100
which makes no sense
because we are not equipped
for heavy shipping.

520
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:39,435
- Then what?
- And then boom!

521
00:33:39,602 --> 00:33:41,228
Godzilla shows up.

522
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:42,438
Caved in half the facility,

523
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:44,565
but I got a sneak peek
at some suspicious tech

524
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,400
which was hidden
in a secret bunker.

525
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:48,235
I mean, some pretty
damn suspicious tech.

526
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:50,446
Yeah, but what is that?

527
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:55,785
That's, um...

528
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:59,705
That's Katzunari
single malt whiskey.

529
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:01,832
Yeah, but it's in a gun holster.

530
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:04,084
It was a gift from my Sara.

531
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:05,252
You have a Sara?

532
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:06,504
She was my wife.

533
00:34:07,046 --> 00:34:09,006
Um, she passed on.

534
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:14,220
She was my rock.

535
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:16,096
My truth.

536
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:20,017
I'll tell you something,
the day that this goes empty,

537
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,811
that's the day
you know I've given up.

538
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:28,275
Bernie.

539
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:30,528
I think we can help each other.

540
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:37,076
Okay, I guess
now that we're a team,

541
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,245
I feel like we should
come up with a plan.

542
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:40,830
We're breaking into Apex.

543
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,832
- Wait, what?
- You heard her.

544
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:44,542
Tap water.

545
00:34:44,834 --> 00:34:46,210
Shit.

546
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:51,080
TASMAN SEA
40.851 S, 160.4313 F

547
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,280
Hey.

548
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,700
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

549
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:29,370
YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM.

550
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,710
TO UNDERSTAND.

551
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,050
KONG DIDN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW.

552
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,800
HE WAS AFRAID.

553
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,760
NOW, EVERYONE KNOWS.

554
00:35:58,324 --> 00:35:59,658
Thank you.

555
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:02,620
How is she?

556
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:05,915
Calm. So calm, it's scary.

557
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:08,167
That was extraordinary.

558
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:12,004
I have been signing
the alphabet. Basic commands.

559
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:14,632
I thought that he showed
recognition, but he never...

560
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,384
Do you have any idea how long
they've been communicating?

561
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:18,636
No.

562
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:21,013
I knew that they had a bond.

563
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,806
He trusts her.

564
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,808
Without her, he'd be
tearing the ship apart.

565
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,813
You know, Jia's parents
were killed on the island.

566
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,734
When the storm
took over the island,
it wiped out the native people.

567
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:35,235
But Kong saved her.

568
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:37,363
She had nowhere to go.

569
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:41,200
So I made a promise,
then and there, to protect her.

570
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,621
And I think that in some way,
he did the same.

571
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,834
Do you think he would take
directions from her?

572
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,171
No.

573
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:56,340
If we have someone who can
keep the reins on Kong...

574
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:58,467
Yeah, no one can keep
the reins on Kong.

575
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:01,512
And she's a child.

576
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,501
I know Jia is only a child.

577
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:35,713
But she's the only one
he'll communicate with.

578
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:40,009
<i>And we need Kong
to find that power source.</i>

579
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,595
The world needs him.

580
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:58,193
What's she saying?

581
00:37:58,527 --> 00:37:59,528
Godzilla.

582
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:10,497
Did we change course?

583
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:12,583
No. We're nowhere near
the areas you flagged.

584
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,501
It looks like
he's coming for us anyway.

585
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:15,711
He's not coming for us.

586
00:38:15,878 --> 00:38:18,297
Him? Then dump him.
Dump the monkey!

587
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:20,466
How about we throw
you off instead, huh?

588
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,677
We have to release him.

589
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:25,304
If we lose Kong,
the mission is over.

590
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,513
He's a sitting duck out there.

591
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,640
We have to let him
protect himself. And us.

592
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:08,764
Delta...

593
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:24,423
Oh, my God, Jia!

594
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,632
Nathan?

595
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,157
He needs our help.

596
00:44:19,241 --> 00:44:21,118
There must be some way
to disorient Godzilla.

597
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:22,494
Depth charges.

598
00:45:08,457 --> 00:45:09,374
Run!

599
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:35,567
He's circling back.

600
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:38,153
This won't end until
one of them submits.

601
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:42,991
- Shut it down.
- What?

602
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,910
All of it.

603
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,536
Guns, engines.

604
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:49,789
- Shut it down. Right now.
- If we do that, we're dead.

605
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:51,708
No, we're playing dead.

606
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:53,460
And we're making him think
that he's won.

607
00:45:57,506 --> 00:46:01,259
Cut the power.
Cut the engines.
<i>Kill anything
that makes a noise.</i>

608
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:16,066
This better work.

609
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:01,610
THANK YOU.

610
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,770
FRIEND.

611
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:10,245
As soon as we move,
he'll be back.

612
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,248
How are we supposed
to get the rest of the way?

613
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:22,048
How's Kong with heights?

614
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:33,935
So, what's the plan?

615
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:36,646
We find out what's on Sublevel 33.

616
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:37,897
- Ow.

617
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:39,649
Keep it moving, tap water.

618
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:44,070
Go ahead.

619
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:55,665
All right, Mad Hatter.
Down the rabbit hole.

620
00:47:57,125 --> 00:47:58,877
Okay. We got this.

621
00:47:59,628 --> 00:48:00,629
Oh, my God!

622
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:02,005
Are you sure we
can trust this guy?

623
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:03,089
Yeah, why?

624
00:48:03,173 --> 00:48:05,216
Well, mainly because he says
crazy shit all the time

625
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:08,178
and carries a bottle of whiskey

626
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:10,388
from his dead wife like a gun.

627
00:48:10,472 --> 00:48:11,473
I think it's romantic.

628
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:14,643
Whoo-hoo!

629
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:33,536
I really don't understand women.

630
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:38,875
Okay, come on.

631
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:42,545
This whole thing came down,
and there was this...

632
00:48:43,505 --> 00:48:44,506
eye.

633
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,467
Uh, what are we looking at?

634
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:49,969
No, no, no, no.
No, it was here.

635
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:52,722
I swear to God, it was...
it was right there.

636
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:53,932
Hey, guys.

637
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,312
Anyone know where this leads to?

638
00:49:00,814 --> 00:49:01,815
You believe me, right?

639
00:49:01,898 --> 00:49:03,316
'Cause I know that
there was something here.

640
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:05,443
I'm gonna get a migraine
from that torch.

641
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:09,948
"Sublevel." How deep does
this thing go, Bernie?

642
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:12,409
Hell. Goes to hell.

00:49:13,493 --> 00:49:15,120

646
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,632
Whoa.

647
00:49:31,094 --> 00:49:32,345
What is all this?

648
00:49:32,846 --> 00:49:34,597
It's breakaway civilization.

649
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:39,436
I mean, come on.
This is page one
in the Apex-playing-God handbook.
Huh?

650
00:49:39,602 --> 00:49:42,689
I mean, the Illuminati
running shadow economies

651
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:45,024
all to fund a hidden colony
for the elite

652
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:47,944
in case any of these governments
and megacorporations

653
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:50,155
accidentally hit
the doomsday button.

654
00:49:51,448 --> 00:49:53,616
- It makes sense if you think about it.
- Yeah, sure.

655
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,454
- Someone's coming.
- What?

656
00:49:57,537 --> 00:49:58,538
- Someone's coming.
- What?

657
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:00,290
- Someone's coming?
- Yes!

658
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:06,087
Oh, my God.

659
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:13,470
- They look like eggs.
- Skull-crawlers.

660
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:16,347
What's Apex doing
with skull-crawlers?

661
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:17,807
All right,
let's load it up!

662
00:50:18,975 --> 00:50:20,685
What was that?
What was that?

663
00:50:20,769 --> 00:50:22,645
- No way. No, no, no. Come on.

664
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:24,647
Okay, guys,
I think we're moving.

665
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,793
It says we're headed
to Apex headquarters in Hong Kong.

666
00:50:44,876 --> 00:50:46,336
- What?
- Hong Kong.

667
00:50:46,503 --> 00:50:48,630
That means that we're
gonna get some answers.

668
00:50:48,797 --> 00:50:50,715
<i>G10, clear for launch.</i>

669
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:02,602

It's not working.

675
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:50,311
Just wait. Wait, wait, wait.

676
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:53,356
What if she tells him
there are others
down there like him?

677
00:53:54,399 --> 00:53:55,441
But you don't know that.

678
00:53:55,817 --> 00:53:58,152
We lost our entire fleet
getting here.

679
00:53:59,278 --> 00:54:00,780
There's no way back for him.

680
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:03,324
And he can't survive here.

681
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:18,631
All right. All right.

682
00:54:25,555 --> 00:54:26,639
Hey.

683
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,680
TELL HIM...

684
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:32,600
...THERE COULD BE MORE LIKE HIM...

685
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:34,980

<i>We'll follow him from behind.</i>

699
00:56:04,946 --> 00:56:05,988
There.

700
00:56:06,614 --> 00:56:07,824
There he is.

701
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,714
Are you sure the monkey's
gonna survive this?

702
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,217
Oh, he'll be fine.
It's us I'd worry about.

703
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:29,428
We're about to be launched
1,000 miles in two seconds

704
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:34,308
until gravity inverts itself
and spits us into free fall.

705
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,604
It'll be the most amazing
thing you've ever seen.

706
00:56:40,815 --> 00:56:42,650
Here. For the vomit.

707
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:43,818
What?

708
00:57:46,339 --> 00:57:49,550
<i>Engine failure, gravity low.</i>

709
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:51,510
<i>- Engine failure.

<i>We're gonna circle back and...</i>

715
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:20,284
All Delta, prepare to attack!

716
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:06,831
That's gross.

<i>Kong's on the move.</i>
<i>We gotta go.</i>

718
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:42,867
<i>Well, he seems to know
where he's going.</i>

719
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,328
Oh, he certainly can move.

720
01:03:13,916 --> 01:03:15,543
Okay, okay.

721
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:17,628
Creepy monorail is slowing down.

<i>Attention:

723
01:03:30,558 --> 01:03:33,018
Okay. Keep quiet.
Follow me.

We're going in?

725
01:03:40,359 --> 01:03:41,527
Yeah.

726
01:03:46,115 --> 01:03:47,116
Oh, no!

727
01:03:48,576 --> 01:03:51,036
Every time, I swear.
Doors hate us.

728
01:03:51,912 --> 01:03:54,290
Oh, yeah.

729
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:01,213
- Aah!
- Oh, my God!

730
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:05,467
It's just so massive.
It's so stupid.

731
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:07,678
So, what is this place?

732
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:09,555
Well, if there's a corporate-friendly term

733
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:11,015
for "sacrifice pit,"

734
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:13,517
I'd say we are in it.

735
01:04:14,643 --> 01:04:16,729
Oh, God, that stinks.

736
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:23,986
That's not good. Bernie!

737
01:04:24,153 --> 01:04:25,279
I really hate this place.

<i>Pilot engaged.</i>

745
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,037
That's robot Godzilla.

Oh, no. That's...

747
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:00,708
That's Mechagodzilla.

748
01:06:19,727 --> 01:06:21,687

749
01:06:29,236 --> 01:06:31,572

Madison!

750
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:40,539
Madison! Run, girl!

01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:42,166
Run, girl. Go!

752
01:07:08,525 --> 01:07:09,526
Yes!

01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:21,205

756
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:27,127
As expected.

<i>Don't worry.

<i>Oh, they'll find it.

761
01:07:38,764 --> 01:07:40,974
I have faith in our creation.

762
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:43,769
And humanity will once again...

763
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:46,188
be the apex species.

764
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:51,151
This is why Godzilla attacked
the Apex facility.

765
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:54,446
They're trying to replace him.

766
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:21,682
Come on, Maddie.

767
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:26,186
<i>Sir, Godzilla just made
an abrupt change</i>

01:08:27,646 --> 01:08:30,107
<i>Projections show he's
likely headed to Hong Kong.</i>

770
01:08:30,232 --> 01:08:32,943
<i>Transport is ready and waiting

771
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:55,382
That has to be it.

772
01:10:55,794 --> 01:10:57,462
We were right.

773
01:10:58,588 --> 01:10:59,923
He's home.

774
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:25,675
<i>All personnel must display</i>

777
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:34,392
Lizard people build
all their facilities
the same way.
I can find the exit.

778
01:12:36,728 --> 01:12:38,271
The exit's this way.

779

Guys. Madison!

780
01:12:50,659 --> 01:12:52,369
Oh, my God.

Bitch, what?

782
01:12:57,332 --> 01:12:58,834
It's a Titan skull.

783
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,586
No, no, no.
That's not just any Titan.

784
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:03,630
That's Monster Zero.

785
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,966
Ghidorah.

786
01:13:10,637 --> 01:13:12,430
They hardwired its DNA.

787
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:14,599
Self-generating neural pathways

788
01:13:14,683 --> 01:13:16,685
capable of intuitive learning.

789
01:13:16,852 --> 01:13:18,770
Okay, I'm smart,
but I only go to high school.

790
01:13:18,937 --> 01:13:20,981
- It's a living supercomputer.
- Shh.

791
01:13:24,276 --> 01:13:25,944
It had three heads.

792
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:29,781
Its necks were so long,
they communicated telepathically.

793
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:33,535
And there's one here
and another one
inside of that thing.

794
01:13:33,702 --> 01:13:35,871
Yeah, it could be
a psionic interface.

795
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:38,331
Oh, my God.

796
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:41,084
Careful.

797
01:13:41,376 --> 01:13:42,377
It's a pilot.

798
01:13:42,544 --> 01:13:45,213
Yeah.
He's in a trance.

799
01:13:45,839 --> 01:13:47,591
That's a psionic uplink.

800
01:13:48,884 --> 01:13:50,886
It follows his will.

801
01:13:51,469 --> 01:13:53,680
Oh, Apex, what have you done?

802
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,684
This is the day we feared.
I've given the order, Doctor.

803
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:41,269
- <i>The city is being evacuated.</i>

804
01:14:49,778 --> 01:14:52,906
I don't understand.
He led us here. Where is it?

805
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:14,177
What is he doing?

806
01:15:43,957 --> 01:15:45,417
It's the axe.

807
01:15:45,625 --> 01:15:48,878
It's drawing radiation
from the core
like it's charging.

808
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:34,507
Whoa! Godzilla's
responding! They found it!

809
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:40,013
What in the hell?

810
01:16:53,818 --> 01:16:55,236
What are you doing?

811
01:16:55,612 --> 01:16:57,322
Extracting a sample.

812
01:16:57,489 --> 01:16:59,574
This is a power
beyond our understanding.

813
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:01,117
You can't just drill into it.

814
01:17:01,284 --> 01:17:03,036
Actually, we can.

815
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,916
My father gets what he wants.

816
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:09,417
That's Apex property now.

817
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:10,919
What?

818
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:18,885
Energy signature incoming.

819
01:17:19,344 --> 01:17:22,138
We should be able
to recreate it soon.

820
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:27,519
That is the discovery
of the millennium.

821
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:29,854
- You can't strip it for parts.
- Hold it.

822
01:17:56,047 --> 01:17:57,715
Go. Go. Got what we needed.

823
01:17:58,133 --> 01:17:59,259

Mr. Serizawa,

The upgrade is untested.

Once we get online,
<i>Gojira</i> will come

830
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:14,607
He's been coming for us

first awoke.

831
01:18:14,774 --> 01:18:17,068
- We must embrace it.
- We shouldn't rush this.

832
01:18:17,235 --> 01:18:20,280
We have no idea
how this energy source
will affect the Mecha.

833
01:18:20,447 --> 01:18:22,073
Get in the goddamn chair.

834
01:18:37,505 --> 01:18:39,549
- Go, go, go!
- Come on, come on!

835
01:18:40,258 --> 01:18:42,552
Move! What are you
waiting for? Let's go!

836
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,936

01:19:18,505 --> 01:19:19,506
Okay.

No, no, no...

Oh, Jesus!
Come on, let's go!

843
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:49,721
- Hold on, ladies.
- Yeah.

844
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:51,681

Yeah. Going viral.

848
01:21:27,133 --> 01:21:28,134
What?

849
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:30,678
We've gotta try and stop this.

850
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:35,266
Mm-mm. I don't like this, guys.

851
01:21:35,433 --> 01:21:37,268
If this wasn't contributing
to world destruction,

852
01:21:37,352 --> 01:21:38,728
this would be
a great DJ booth.

853
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:44,400
I know what it... Maintenance.

854
01:21:44,567 --> 01:21:45,902

She doesn't buy that.
Uh, Madison, we need to go.

857
01:21:49,656 --> 01:21:50,782
The woman with
the villain hairdo...

858
01:21:50,865 --> 01:21:52,533
Madison, they have guns.

859
01:21:52,659 --> 01:21:55,787
Hey, guys. Uh, it's soundproof
so I can't really...

860
01:21:55,953 --> 01:21:57,747
- I wanna communicate...
- Open the door!

861
01:21:57,914 --> 01:21:58,998
Say again?

862
01:21:59,165 --> 01:22:00,875
Oh, God!
Get down! Get down!

863
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:02,877
Oh, shit!

864
01:24:38,032 --> 01:24:40,201
We're about to breach the veil!
Hold on!

865
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:53,774
Looks like round two
goes to Kong.

866
01:26:06,245 --> 01:26:07,246
Hey!

01:26:12,627 --> 01:26:15,421
Oh, come on, guys.
Really? Greenpeace again?

868
01:26:16,213 --> 01:26:18,215
Greenpea...

869

01:26:28,601 --> 01:26:32,563
I'm just saying Greenpeace
wishes, is all I'm saying.

875
01:26:33,731 --> 01:26:36,317
Where do I know you from?

876
01:26:39,028 --> 01:26:40,947
Oh, my goodness.

877
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:44,200
Director Russell's daughter,
yes?

878
01:26:44,575 --> 01:26:46,202
You caused all of this.

879
01:26:46,369 --> 01:26:50,539
If by "all of this,"
you mean I, and I alone,

880
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,125
have given humanity a chance
against the Titans,

881
01:26:53,292 --> 01:26:56,087
then, yes,
I will own that title.

882
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:58,589
Godzilla had left us in peace.

883
01:26:58,756 --> 01:27:00,508
You provoked him into war.

884
01:27:00,675 --> 01:27:03,344
There can only be one alpha,
Miss Russell.

885
01:27:03,511 --> 01:27:06,097
It seems to have
been providence.

886
01:29:56,225 --> 01:29:59,895
<i>It's time to launch.</i>
<i>Begin pilot integration.</i>

887
01:30:00,290 --> 01:30:01,350
INTEGRATING ENERGY WITH
MECH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

888
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:02,980
INTEGRATION
COMPLETE

889
01:30:07,862 --> 01:30:09,071
And now...

890
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:11,490
my Mecha.

891
01:30:12,992 --> 01:30:15,202
<i>It's not only
Godzilla's equal...</i>

892
01:30:17,288 --> 01:30:19,039
<i>but his superior.</i>

893
01:30:21,167 --> 01:30:24,670
The Apex Titan of my own hand.

894
01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:29,175
<i>It's time to show
the world what you can do.</i>

895
01:30:31,719 --> 01:30:33,470
<i>Pilot engaged.</i>

896
01:30:37,516 --> 01:30:40,686
<i>Alert: Failure.
System unstable.</i>

897
01:30:40,853 --> 01:30:44,648
<i>Alert: Failure.
System unstable.</i>

898
01:30:45,410 --> 01:30:46,900
PILOT DISCONNECTED

899
01:30:46,984 --> 01:30:50,237
This is how we,
as a species, win.

900
01:30:51,697 --> 01:30:53,157
You see, 10 years ago,

901
01:30:53,699 --> 01:30:56,785
when <i>Gojira</i> was first
revealed to the world,

902
01:30:57,203 --> 01:30:59,121
I had a dream.

903
01:30:59,538 --> 01:31:02,458
And in that dream,
I saw one thing.

904
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:08,255
And that beautiful,
amazing thing was...

905
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:12,468
Oh, shit.

906
01:31:12,635 --> 01:31:13,636
No!

907
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:28,817
It's unfair.

908
01:31:28,901 --> 01:31:30,861
I really wanted to hear
the rest of that speech.

909
01:32:07,398 --> 01:32:08,816
What in God's name is that?

910
01:32:53,944 --> 01:32:56,071
It's thinking for itself now.

911
01:32:56,405 --> 01:32:57,781
We have to warn Monarch.

912
01:32:58,615 --> 01:33:00,492
Or try to stop it ourselves.

913
01:33:01,201 --> 01:33:02,745
That thing's still linked
to their satellite.

914
01:33:02,828 --> 01:33:04,371
Wait, Josh.

915
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:08,625
If I can figure out
the password,
maybe we can shut it down.

916
01:33:08,792 --> 01:33:09,793
All right.

917
01:33:23,766 --> 01:33:25,184
What the hell is that?

918
01:34:17,027 --> 01:34:20,072
What?

919
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:22,150
HIS HEART IS SLOWING DOWN.

920
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:25,369
What's happening?

921
01:34:26,245 --> 01:34:27,871
She can feel his heartbeat.

922
01:34:28,539 --> 01:34:29,581
He's dying.

923
01:34:32,209 --> 01:34:34,253
There's nothing we can do
to restart his heart.

924
01:34:34,336 --> 01:34:35,629
We'd need a charge
big enough to...

925
01:34:35,796 --> 01:34:37,464
Light up Las Vegas for a week.

926
01:35:00,988 --> 01:35:02,197
- Is that a password?

927
01:35:03,824 --> 01:35:04,992
Is that a password?

928
01:35:05,075 --> 01:35:06,368
I don't know!
I'm not used to this.

929
01:35:06,535 --> 01:35:08,162
I'm used to pirating
movies online.

930
01:35:08,245 --> 01:35:09,580
- Okay, then go to Settings.

931
01:35:09,746 --> 01:35:10,998
- <i>This is Mark.
- Dad?</i>

932
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:13,167
Madison, where are you?

933
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:14,960
<i>Dad, can you hear...</i>

934
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:17,296
Can you hear me?
I'm in Hong Kong.

935
01:35:17,463 --> 01:35:18,839
<i>- Mad?
- Dad!</i>

936
01:35:19,006 --> 01:35:20,841
Mad? Madison!

937
01:35:25,554 --> 01:35:26,722
- A-ha!

938
01:35:30,184 --> 01:35:32,102
Okay, you two better
get some distance.

939
01:35:38,734 --> 01:35:39,943
Hey.

940
01:35:41,904 --> 01:35:43,906
You are a very brave little girl.

941
01:35:45,050 --> 01:35:46,860
COWARD.

942
01:35:52,456 --> 01:35:53,624
I don't know.

943
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:55,417
Maybe we both are.

944
01:36:34,206 --> 01:36:35,374
Okay.

945
01:36:39,378 --> 01:36:40,921
Good luck, big fella.

946
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:23,580
GODZILLA. NOT. ENEMY.

947
01:37:34,370 --> 01:37:37,930
THAT, IS ENEMY.

948
01:37:38,990 --> 01:37:41,100
IT'S TRUE.

949
01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:48,780
PLEASE...

950
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:50,820
...BE CAREFULL.

951
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:17,643
I thought you said
you were a hacker!

952
01:38:17,726 --> 01:38:19,686
I said I took an HTML course
at summer camp.

953
01:38:19,853 --> 01:38:21,355
- HTML?
- Yes, at summer camp.

954
01:38:21,521 --> 01:38:23,774
Was it a '90s camp?
Come on. Use QWERTY.

955
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:26,109
<i>Error. Security lock.</i>

956
01:38:26,276 --> 01:38:28,487
- No. Shit!

957
01:38:28,654 --> 01:38:30,030
Shit.

958
01:40:07,836 --> 01:40:09,588
Josh!
You have to do something.

959
01:40:09,963 --> 01:40:11,757
We tried to take down
those Apex bastards,

960
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:12,966
but I think this is
as far as we go,

961
01:40:13,049 --> 01:40:14,426
so bottom's up.

962
01:40:14,593 --> 01:40:16,553
I was hoping to die
with adults, but okay.

963
01:40:22,017 --> 01:40:23,143
If you've never had a drink before,

964
01:40:23,226 --> 01:40:24,352
now's the time 'cause...

965
01:40:24,936 --> 01:40:26,229
Drink. Drink!

966
01:40:26,688 --> 01:40:28,148
- Hey! What are you...

967
01:40:30,108 --> 01:40:31,610
That's your solution?

968
01:40:31,693 --> 01:40:33,695
I gotta die here with you,
and sober!

969
01:40:57,469 --> 01:40:58,804
- Yeah!
- Yes! Yes!

970
01:41:52,232 --> 01:41:53,525
Hey, Nathan?

971
01:41:55,151 --> 01:41:56,778
- Nathan?

972
01:41:57,112 --> 01:41:58,738
Nathan, are you okay?

973
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:23,763
Dad?

974
01:42:25,390 --> 01:42:26,391
Dad!

975
01:42:27,392 --> 01:42:28,393
- Dad!
- I love you.

976
01:42:36,818 --> 01:42:39,988
Hi. Um, it was, um...
Madison's idea.

977
01:42:41,239 --> 01:42:42,824
Shut up, Josh.

978
01:42:42,991 --> 01:42:46,411
Dad. This is the man
who saved our lives.

979
01:42:46,578 --> 01:42:47,829
Bernie, meet Dad.

980
01:42:47,996 --> 01:42:49,497
Dad. Uh, Bernie.

981
01:42:49,581 --> 01:42:51,124
Um, it's an absolute pleasure
to meet you.

982
01:42:51,291 --> 01:42:54,628
I was wondering if I could
invite you onto my podcast

983
01:42:54,794 --> 01:42:57,964
to talk about the Monarch
facility in Roswell because...

984
01:43:03,887 --> 01:43:05,221
It's amazing. It happened...

985
01:43:18,944 --> 01:43:20,570
Jia? Jia!

986
01:44:35,729 --> 01:44:38,732
Heads up, guys! He's coming
around for his morning walk.
