1
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,195
Asgardian: This is the asgardian

2
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,739
refugee vessel statesman.

3
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,785
We are under assault.

4
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,954
I repeat, we are under assault.

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,666
The engines are dead, life support failing.

6
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,794
Requesting aid from any vessel within range.

7
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,964
We are 22 jump points out of asgard.

8
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,592
Our crew is made up of asgardian families.

9
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,177
We have very few soldiers here.

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,221
This is not a warcraft.

11
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,306
I repeat, this is not a warcraft.

12
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,781
Ebony maw: Hear me and rejoice.

13
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,829
You have had the privilege

14
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,582
of being saved by the great titan.

15
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,753
You may think this is suffering.

16
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,342
It is salvation.

17
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,933
Universal scales tip toward balance

18
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,768
because of your sacrifice.

19
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,813
Smile.

20
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,150
For even in death,

21
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,694
you have become children of Thanos.

22
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,170
I know what it's like to lose.

23
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:13,300
To feel so desperately that you're right...

24
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,803
Yet to fail, nonetheless.

25
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,521
It's frightening.

26
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,816
Turns the legs to jelly.

27
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,071
But I ask you, to what end?

28
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,075
Dread it, run from it...

29
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,662
Destiny arrives all the same.

30
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,706
And now, it's here.

31
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,125
Or should I say...

32
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,003
I am.

33
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,760
You talk too much.

34
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,471
The tesseract.

35
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,015
Or your brother's head.

36
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,064
I assume you have a preference.

37
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,608
Oh, I do.

38
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,028
Kill away.

39
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,420
All right, stop!

40
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,967
We don't have the tesseract.

41
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,927
It was destroyed on asgard.

42
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,607
You really are the worst brother.

43
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,573
I assure you, brother...

44
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,742
The sun will shine on us again.

45
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,621
Your optimism is misplaced, asgardian.

46
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:10,751
Well, for one thing, I'm not asgardian.

47
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,127
And for another...

48
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,797
We have a hulk.

49
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,853
Let him have his fun.

50
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,615
Allfathers...

51
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,745
Let the dark magic flow through me one last...

52
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,664
Time.

53
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,972
That was a mistake.

54
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,283
You're going to die for that.

55
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,620
Shh.

56
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,296
My humble personage...

57
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,008
Bows before your grandeur.

58
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,514
No other being has ever had the might...

59
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,600
Nay, the nobility...

60
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:36,688
To wield not one, but two infinity stones.

61
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,571
The universe lies within your grasp.

62
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,571
There are two more stones on earth.

63
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,534
Find them, my children, and bring them to me on titan.

64
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,244
Father, we will not fail you.

65
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,913
Loki: If I might interject.

66
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,376
If you're going to earth, you might want a guide.

67
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,963
I do have a bit of experience in that arena.

68
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,298
If you consider failure experience.

69
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,218
I consider experience experience.

70
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,929
Almighty Thanos...

71
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:55,892
I, loki, prince of asgard...

72
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,897
Odinson...

73
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,736
The rightful king of Jotunheim...

74
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,239
God of mischief...

75
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,616
Do hereby pledge to you...

76
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,913
My undying fidelity.

77
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,967
Undying?

78
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,390
You should choose your words more carefully.

79
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:57,954
You...

80
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,665
Will never be...

81
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,502
A god.

82
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,805
No!

83
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,281
No resurrections this time.

84
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,057
No.lokl

85
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,765
Dr. Strange: Seriously, you don't have any money?

86
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,977
Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.

87
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,436
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

88
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,523
Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye.

89
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,482
Oh. Wait, wait, wait. I think I have 200.

90
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,650
Dollars?

91
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,152
- Rupees. - Which is?

92
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,154
Uh, buck and a half.

93
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,530
What do you want?

94
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,324
I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.

95
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,755
Thanos is coming.

96
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,549
He's coming.

97
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,013
Who?

98
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,166
Stark: Slow down, slow down. I'll spell it out for you.

99
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,250
Pepper: You're totally rambling.

100
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,376
Stark: No, I'm not. Pepper: You lost me.

101
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,586
Look, you know how you're having a dream,

102
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,850
and in the dream you gotta pee.

103
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:35,904
- Yeah. - Okay.

104
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,256
And then you're like, "oh, my god.

105
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,507
"There's no bathrooms. What am I gonna do?

106
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,592
- "Oh, someone's watching." - Right.

107
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,676
"Oh, I'm gonna go in my pants."

108
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,844
And then you wake up and in real life

109
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:42,911
you actually have to pee.

110
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:43,995
- Yes. - Yeah.

111
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,205
- Okay. - Everybody has that.

112
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,081
Right, that's the point I'm trying to make.

113
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,419
Apropos of that, last night I dreamt we had a kid.

114
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,213
It was so real.

115
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:54,982
We named him after your eccentric uncle.

116
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,007
Uh, what was his name?

117
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,426
- Right. - Morgan! Morgan.

118
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,220
- So you woke up... - Naturally.

119
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,971
And thought that we were...

120
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,139
- Expecfing. - Yeah.

121
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,951
I had a dream about it. It was so real.

122
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,310
If you wanted to have a kid...

123
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,395
You wouldn't have done that.

124
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,023
I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing.

125
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,667
It's just a housing unit for nanoparticles.

126
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,109
You're not helping your case, okay?

127
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,462
No, this is detachable. It's not a...

128
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,946
You don't need that.

129
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,364
I know, I had the surgery.

130
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,674
I'm just trying to protect us...

131
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,325
And future usses and that's it.

132
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,136
Just in case there's a monster in the closet.

133
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,079
- Instead of, you know... - Shirts.

134
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,207
You know me so well.

135
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,001
- God. - You finish all my sentences.

136
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,420
You should have shirts in your closet.

137
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:35,797
Yeah.

138
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,484
You know what there should be? No more surprises.

139
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,860
We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight.

140
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,970
Show off this Harry Winston.

141
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,389
Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever.

142
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,598
I should promise you.

143
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,058
- Yes. - I will.

144
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,520
Thank you.

145
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:51,813
Dr. Strange: Tony stark.

146
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,983
I'm doctor Stephen strange. I need you to come with me.

147
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,570
Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way.

148
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,577
I'm sorry, you giving out tickets to something?

149
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,116
We need your help.

150
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,493
It's not overselling it to say that

151
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,161
the fate of the universe is at stake.

152
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,746
And who's "we"?

153
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,541
Hey, Tony.

154
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,709
Bruce.

155
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,502
- Banner: Pepper. - Hi.

156
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,132
- Banner: Oh. - You okay?

157
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,094
Wong: At the dawn of the universe,

158
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,138
there was nothing. Then...

159
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,806
Boom.

160
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,685
The big bang sent six elemental crystals...

161
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,688
Hurtling across the virgin universe.

162
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,274
These infinity stones

163
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,277
each control an essential aspect of existence.

164
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,404
Dr. Strange: Space.

165
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,698
Reality.

166
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,492
Power.

167
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,870
Soul.

168
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,164
Mind.

169
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,334
And time.

170
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,094
Tell me his name again.

171
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,471
Thanos.

172
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,930
He's a plague, Tony.

173
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,891
He invades planets. He takes what he wants.

174
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,185
He wipes out half the population.

175
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,062
He sent loki.

176
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,607
The attack on New York, that's him.

177
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,317
This is it.

178
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,486
What's our timeline?

179
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,780
No telling. He has the power and space stones.

180
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:24,947
That already makes him

181
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,717
the strongest creature in the whole universe.

182
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,994
If he gets his hands on all six stones, Tony...

183
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,245
He could destroy life

184
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,373
on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

185
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,459
Did you seriouslyjust say "hitherto undreamt of'?

186
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,728
Are you seriously leaning on the cauldron of the cosmos?

187
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,295
Is that what it is?

188
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,925
I'm going to allow that.

189
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,654
If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just

190
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,198
stick this one down a garbage disposal?

191
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,223
No can do.

192
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,101
We swore an oath to protect the time stone with our lives.

193
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,507
Stark: And I swore off dairy...

194
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,979
But then Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me.

195
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,606
- Stark raving hazelnuts. - Not bad.

196
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,149
A bit chalky.

197
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,002
A hunk of hulk of burning fudge is our favorite.

198
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,152
- That's a thing? - Whatever.

199
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,404
Point is, things change.

200
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,323
Our oath to protect the time stone cannot change.

201
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,676
And this stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.

202
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,701
Yeah, so conversely,

203
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,578
it may also be his best chance against us.

204
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,122
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

205
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,289
What is your job exactly?

206
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,999
Besides making balloon animals.

207
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,670
Protecting your reality, douchebag.

208
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,339
Okay, guys. Could we table this discussion right now?

209
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,383
The fact is we have this stone.

210
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,759
We know where it is.

211
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,470
Vision is out there somewhere with the mind stone...

212
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,347
And we have to find him now.

213
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,558
Yeah, that's the thing.

214
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,642
What do you mean?

215
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,978
Two weeks ago, vision turned off his transponder.

216
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,104
He's offline.

217
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,522
- What? - Yeah.

218
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,607
Tony, you lost another super-bot?

219
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,026
I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.

220
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,653
Who could find vision then?

221
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,657
Stark: Shit.

222
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,325
Probably Steve Rogers.

223
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,660
Oh, great.

224
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,328
Maybe.

225
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,955
But...

226
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,543
Call him.

227
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,587
It's not that easy.

228
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,471
God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?

229
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,384
The avengers broke up. We're toast.

230
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,094
Broke up?

231
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,890
Like a band? Like... like the Beatles?

232
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,975
Cap and I fell out hard.

233
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,144
We're not on speaking terms.

234
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,106
Tony, listen to me.

235
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,525
Thor's gone.

236
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,403
Thanos is coming.

237
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,327
It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.

238
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,381
Stark: Flip phone.

239
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,755
Say, doc, you wouldn't happen to be

240
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:10,947
moving your hair, would ya?

241
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,116
Not at the moment, no.

242
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,651
You okay?

243
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,817
- Help him! - Wong: Banner!

244
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,530
- Wong! Look alive! - Go, go! We got it!

245
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,799
Friday, what am I looking at?

246
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,223
Friday: Not sure. I'm working on it.

247
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,368
Hey! You might wanna put that time stone

248
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,661
in your back pocket, doc!

249
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,037
Might wanna use it.

250
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,775
Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.

251
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,235
Holy shit.

252
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,070
We're all gonna die!

253
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,447
There's a spaceship!

254
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,324
Boy: What's going on? Ned: Oh, my god!

255
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,018
What's the matter with you kids?

256
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,835
You never seen a spaceship before?

257
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,433
Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd street.

258
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,517
Notify first responders.

259
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,852
Friday: Will do.

260
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:36,133
Hear me and rejoice.

261
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,969
You are about to die

262
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,097
at the hands of the children of Thanos.

263
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,724
Be thankful...

264
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,435
That your meaningless lives are now contributing...

265
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,563
I'm sorry, earth is closed today.

266
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,441
You better pack it up and get outta here.

267
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,734
Stonekeeper.

268
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:56,946
Does this chattering animal speak for you?

269
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,906
Certainly not. I speak for myself.

270
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,784
You're trespassing in this city and on this planet.

271
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,245
He means get lost, squidward.

272
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,579
He exhausts me.

273
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,707
Bring me the stone.

274
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,793
Banner, you want a piece?

275
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,170
Mmm, no, not really.

276
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,614
But when do I ever get what I want?

277
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,715
That's right.

278
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,633
Okay. Push!

279
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,260
It's been a while.

280
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,928
It's gonna be good to have you, buddy.

281
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,096
Okay. Shh.

282
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,932
Let me just... I need to concentrate here for a second.

283
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,392
Come on, come on, man.

284
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,728
Banner: God!

285
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,105
Where's your guy?

286
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,042
I don't know. We've sorta been having a thing.

287
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,252
- It's no time for a thing. - I know.

288
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,796
That's the thing right there. Let's go.

289
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,262
Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.

290
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,264
Tony, I'm sorry. Either I can't or he won't.

291
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,289
It's okay.

292
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,750
Hey, stand down. Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

293
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,251
- I have him. - Damn it.

294
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,113
Where'd that come from?

295
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,323
Iron man: It's nanotech.

296
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,806
You like it? A little something I...

297
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,497
Doctor banner, if the rest of your green friend

298
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,748
won't be joining us...

299
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,818
Iron man: Gotta get that stone outta here, now.

300
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,135
It stays with me.

301
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,220
Exactly. Bye.

302
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,189
Banner: Tony, you okay?

303
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,316
- How we doing? Good? Bad? - Really, really good.

304
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,668
Really good. Do you plan on helping out?

305
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,985
I'm trying. He won't come out.

306
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,947
Iron man: Hammer.

307
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,582
Come on, hulk! What are you doing to me?

308
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,876
Come out! Come out! Come out!

309
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,254
No!

310
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,926
What do you mean, "no"?

311
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,362
Spider-man: Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?

312
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,270
- Kid, where 'd you come from? - A field trip to moma.

313
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,953
Uh, what is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?

314
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,942
Uh, he's from space.

315
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,986
He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.

316
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,472
Your powers are quaint.

317
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,308
You must be popular with children.

318
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,062
It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.

319
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,189
Then I'll take it off your corpse.

320
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:37,333
You'll find removing a dead man's spell troublesome.

321
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,209
You'll only wish you were dead.

322
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,244
Iron man: Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.

323
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,811
Spider-man: On it!

324
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,612
Not cool.

325
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,867
Gotcha!

326
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:14,078
Wait!

327
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,713
Uh, Mr. Stark, I'm being beamed up.

328
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,173
Iron man: Hang on, kid.

329
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,232
Banner: Om

330
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,026
ugh.

331
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,870
Iron man: Wong, you're invited to my wedding.

332
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,651
Give me a little juice, Friday.

333
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,880
Unlock 17:A.

334
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,613
Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.

335
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,731
Spider-man: But you said save the wizard!

336
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:25,149
I can't breathe.

337
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,202
We're too high up. You're running out of air.

338
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,321
Yeah. That makes sense.

339
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,507
Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!

340
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,776
Iron man: Happy trails, kid.

341
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,320
- Friday, send him home. - Friday: Yep.

342
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:55,637
Spider-man: Oh, come on!

343
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,065
Friday: Boss, incoming call from miss potts.

344
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,232
Pepper: Tony? Oh, my god.

345
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:08,460
Are you all right? What's going on?

346
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,836
Iron man: Yeah, I'm fine. I just think

347
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,212
we might have to push our 8:30 res.

348
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,321
Pepper: Why?

349
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,906
Iron man: Just 'cause I'll probably

350
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,407
not make it back for a while.

351
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:17,802
Pepper: Tell me you're not on that ship.

352
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,827
Yeah.

353
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,388
God, no, please tell me you're not on the ship.

354
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,997
Honey, I'm sorry.

355
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,391
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.

356
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,809
Come back here, Tony. Iswear to god.

357
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,919
- Pep. - Come back here right now.

358
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,164
Come back.

359
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,130
Friday: Boss, we 're losing her.

360
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,341
I'm going too.

361
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,684
Spider-man: Oh, my god!

362
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,108
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

363
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,832
Where you going?

364
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,500
The time stone's been taken.

365
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,585
The sanctum remains unguarded.

366
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,671
What will you do?

367
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,132
I'm gonna make a call.

368
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,590
Sing it, drax!

369
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,562
Why are we doing this again?

370
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,355
It's a distress signal, rocket.

371
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,440
Someone could be dying.

372
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,692
I get that, but why are we doing it?

373
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,652
'Cause we're nice.

374
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:16,820
And maybe whoever it is

375
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,715
will give us a little cheddar cheese for our effort.

376
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,074
- Which isn't the point. - Which isn't the point.

377
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,951
I mean, if he doesn't pony up...

378
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,161
We take his ship.

379
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,996
- Rocket: Exactly! - Bingo!

380
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,080
Rocket: All right!

381
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,835
We are arriving.

382
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,253
All right, guardians,

383
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:34,606
don't forget this might be dangerous...

384
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,924
So let's put on our mean faces.

385
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,722
Groot, put that thing away, now.

386
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,866
I don't wanna tell you again.

387
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,050
Groot.

388
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,309
I am groot!

389
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,432
- Whoa! - Rocket: Language!

390
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:49,853
- Hey! - Wow.

391
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,688
You got some acorns on you, kid.

392
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,398
Ever since you got a little sap,

393
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:54,483
you're a total d-hole.

394
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,695
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna smash that thing to pieces.

395
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,162
Mantis: What happened?

396
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,542
Oh, my god.

397
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,883
Looks like we're not getting paid.

398
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,096
Wipers! Wipers!

399
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,555
Get it off.

400
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,982
How the hell is this dude still alive?

401
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,942
He is not a dude.

402
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,652
You're a dude.

403
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:42,030
This... this is a man.

404
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:45,158
A handsome, muscular man.

405
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,326
I'm muscular.

406
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,470
But who are you kidding, quill?

407
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,870
You're one sandwich away from fat.

408
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:49,955
Peter: Yeah, right.

409
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,599
Drax: It's true, quill. You have put on weight.

410
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,624
What?

411
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,753
Gamora, do you think I'm...

412
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,634
He is anxious, angry.

413
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,679
He feels tremendous loss and guilt.

414
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,308
It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.

415
00:30:09,391 --> 00:30:10,475
Peter: Wow.

416
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,436
This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay.

417
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,314
I'm gonna get a bowflex. I'm gonna commit.

418
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,582
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

419
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,084
Rocket: You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?

420
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,318
Gamora: It's like his muscles

421
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,320
are made of cotati metal fibers.

422
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,196
Stop massaging his muscles.

423
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,991
Wake him up.

424
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,078
Wake.

425
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,931
Who the hell are you guys?

426
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:56,355
The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal.

427
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,231
To bring balance to the universe

428
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:00,484
by wiping out half of all life.

429
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,612
He used to kill people planet by planet,

430
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,072
massacre by massacre.

431
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,740
Including my own.

432
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,492
If he gets all six infinity stones...

433
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,869
He can do it with the snap of his fingers like this.

434
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,456
You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.

435
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:18,418
Gamora is the daughter of Thanos.

436
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,549
Your father killed my brother.

437
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,093
Oh, boy.

438
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,928
Stepfather, technically.

439
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,013
And she hates him as much as you do.

440
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,268
Thor: Families can be tough.

441
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,770
Before my father died,

442
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,605
he told me that I had a half-sister...

443
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,024
That he imprisoned in hel.

444
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:44,152
And then she returned home and stabbed me in the eye.

445
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,612
So I had to kill her.

446
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,823
That's life though, isn't it, I guess.

447
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,157
Goes round and round and...

448
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:50,992
I feel your pain.

449
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,453
I feel your pain as well, because_.

450
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,847
I mean, it's not a competition,

451
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:55,997
but I've been through a lot.

452
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,833
My father killed my mother.

453
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,185
And then I had to kill my father.

454
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,710
That was hard.

455
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,755
Probably even harder than having to kill a sister.

456
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,175
Plus, I came out with both my eyes, which was...

457
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,052
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

458
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,974
How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of, uh...

459
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,060
A four-digit code, maybe? Maybe a birthdate.

460
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:20,522
- Uh, what are you doing? - Taking your pod.

461
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,222
No, you're not.

462
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:29,030
You will not be taking our pod today, sir.

463
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:32,909
Uh... quill, are you making your voice deeper?

464
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,455
- No. - You are.

465
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,332
You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.

466
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,667
No, I'm not.

467
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,878
- He just did it again! - This is my voice.

468
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,051
Are you mocking me?

469
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,430
- Are you mocking me? - Stop it. You did it again.

470
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,931
He's trying to copy me.

471
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,159
I need you to stop doing that.

472
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,809
- Gamora: Enough! - He's doing it first.

473
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,352
We need to stop Thanos.

474
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,062
Which means we need to find out

475
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,147
where he's going next.

476
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,565
Knowhere.

477
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,400
He must be going somewhere.

478
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,569
No, no. Knowhere?

479
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:10,405
It's a place. We've been there. It sucks.

480
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,991
- Excuse me, that's our food. - Not anymore.

481
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,578
Thor, why would he go to knowhere?

482
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:17,913
Thor: Because for years...

483
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,248
The reality stone's been safely stored there

484
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,750
with a man called the collector.

485
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,644
Peter: If it's with the collector, then it's not safe.

486
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,378
Only an idiot would give that man a stone.

487
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,064
- Or a genius. - Gamora: How do you know...

488
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,633
He's not going for one of the other stones?

489
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,177
There are six stones out there.

490
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,554
Thanos already has the power stone...

491
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:38,016
Because he stole it last week when he decimated xandar.

492
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,519
He stole the space stone from me...

493
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,355
When he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people.

494
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,202
The time and mind stones are safe on earth.

495
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,272
They're with the avengers.

496
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,818
- The avengers? - Earth's mightiest heroes.

497
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,111
Like Kevin bacon?

498
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,631
He may be on the team. I don't know.

499
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:52,798
I haven't been there in a while.

500
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,033
As for the soul stone, well, no one's ever seen that.

501
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,826
No one even knows where it is.

502
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,745
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

503
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,288
Therefore he's going to knowhere.

504
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,874
Hence he'll be getting the reality stone.

505
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,084
You're welcome.

506
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:05,603
Then we have to go to knowhere now.

507
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:09,297
Wrong. Where we have to go is nidavellir.

508
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,676
- That's a made-up word. - All words are made up.

509
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,844
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

510
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,638
That place is a legend.

511
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,282
They make the most powerful, horrific weapons

512
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,350
To ever torment the universe.

513
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,561
I would very much like to go there, please.

514
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,728
The rabbit is correct

515
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:24,914
and clearly the smartest among you.

516
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:25,981
Rabbit?

517
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,400
Only eitri the dwarf can make me the weapon I need.

518
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,847
I assume you're the captain, sir.

519
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:30,944
You're very perceptive.

520
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,320
You seem like a noble leader.

521
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,084
Will you join me on my quest to nidavellir?

522
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,950
Let me just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me!

523
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,868
- Yeah. I'll go. - Wonderful!

524
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,221
Uh, except for that I'm the captain.

525
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,246
Thor: Quiet.

526
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,049
- That's my backpack. - Rocket: Go sit down.

527
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,708
Peter: Look, this is my ship.

528
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,626
And I'm not goin' to...

529
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,713
Wait, what kinda weapon are we talkin' about here?

530
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,131
The Thanos-killing kind.

531
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,609
Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?

532
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,677
No. You simply lack the strength to wield them.

533
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:56,928
Your bodies would crumble

534
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,322
as your minds collapsed into madness.

535
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,265
Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?

536
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,600
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

537
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,018
If we don't go to knowhere

538
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,686
and Thanos retrieves another stone...

539
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,396
He'll be too powerful to stop.

540
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,732
- He already is. - I got it figured out.

541
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,609
We got two ships

542
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,068
and a large assortment of morons.

543
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,488
So me and groot will go with the pirate angel here.

544
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,882
And the morons will go to knowhere

545
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,491
to try to stop Thanos.

546
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,577
- Cool? Cool. - So cool.

547
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,037
Peter: For the record...

548
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,122
I know that you're going with him

549
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,433
because it's where Thanos isn't.

550
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,958
You know, you really shouldn't

551
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,169
talk that way to your captain, quill.

552
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,463
Come on, groot.

553
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,716
Put that game down. You'll rot your brain.

554
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,264
I bid you farewell and good luck, morons.

555
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,557
Bye.

556
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,490
Vis?

557
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,825
Is it the stone again?

558
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,619
It's as if it's speaking to me.

559
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,954
What does it say?

560
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,208
I don't... I don't know, but something.

561
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,670
Hey.

562
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:24,015
Tell me what you feel.

563
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,733
I just feel you.

564
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,827
Wanda: So there's a 10:00 am. To Glasgow...

565
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,138
Which would give us more time together before you went back.

566
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,622
Vision: What if I miss that train?

567
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:48,790
There's an 11:00.

568
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,376
What if I missed all the trains?

569
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,462
What if this time I didn't go back?

570
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,964
But you gave stark your word.

571
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,298
I'd rather give it to you.

572
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,568
Well, there are people who are expecting me too, you know.

573
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,927
We both made promises.

574
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,804
Not to each other.

575
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,222
Wanda.

576
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,517
For two years, we've stolen these moments...

577
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,728
Trying to see if this could work and...

578
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,479
I don't know.

579
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,606
You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself.

580
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,483
I think...

581
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,850
- Wan da: It works. - It works.

582
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,194
It works.

583
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,906
Stay.

584
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,492
Stay with me.

585
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,500
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

586
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,301
What are they?

587
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,053
What the stone was warning me about.

588
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,356
I have to go.

589
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,441
No, vision.

590
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,318
Vision, if that's true,

591
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,196
then maybe going isn't the best idea.

592
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,323
Wanda, I...

593
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,533
Vision!

594
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,356
The blade, it stopped me from phasing.

595
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,273
- Is that even possible? - It isn't supposed to be.

596
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,028
My systems are failing.

597
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,615
I'm beginning to think we should have stayed in bed.

598
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,160
Vis!

599
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:01,631
Give up the stone, and she lives.

600
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,962
Hands off.

601
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,021
Come on. Come on.

602
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,981
Come on, you gotta get up.

603
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,358
You gotta get up. Come on. Hey.

604
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,861
Hey. We have to go.

605
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,365
Please. Please leave.

606
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,284
You asked me to stay.

607
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,703
- I'm staying. - Please.

608
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,609
- Get up. - I can't.

609
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,487
We don't wanna kill you, but we will.

610
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,823
You'll never get the chance again.

611
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,340
Can you stand?

612
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,513
Thank you, captain.

613
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,851
Let's get you on the jet.

614
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:07,233
Now, I thought we had a deal.

615
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,112
Stay close, check in, don't take any chances.

616
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,613
Wanda: I'm sorry.

617
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,574
We just wanted time.

618
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,536
Sam: Where to, cap?

619
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,874
Home.

620
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,504
Woman: We'll be safe. We'll be safe.

621
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,256
Ebony maw: Zehobereians.

622
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,032
Mother! Where's my mother?

623
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,533
Ebony maw: Choose a side or die.

624
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,160
Girl: Mother!

625
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,496
Ebony maw: One side is a revelation...

626
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,707
The other an honor known only to a few.

627
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,085
What's wrong, little one?

628
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,130
My mother. Where is my mother?

629
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,136
What's your name?

630
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,139
Gamora.

631
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,767
You're quite the fighter, gamora.

632
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,311
Come.

633
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,687
Let me help you.

634
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,327
Look.

635
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,666
Pretty, isn't it?

636
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,878
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.

637
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,799
Too much to one side or the other...

638
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,639
Here. You try.

639
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:08,479
Ebony maw: Now, go in peace to meet your maker.

640
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,816
Thanos: Uh-uh.

641
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,278
Concentrate.

642
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,033
There. You've got it.

643
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:31,627
Peter: Gamora.

644
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:33,856
Do you know if these grenades

645
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,048
are the blow-off-your-junk kind or the gas kind?

646
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,335
Because I was thinking about

647
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,968
hanging a couple on my belt right here.

648
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,195
But I don't want to if they're the...

649
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,470
Gamora: I need to ask a favor.

650
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,723
Yeah, sure.

651
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,350
Gamora: One way or another,

652
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,686
the path that we're on leads to Thanos.

653
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:51,939
Which is what the grenades are for.

654
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,193
Uh, I'm sorry. What's the favor?

655
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,529
If things go wrong...

656
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:02,283
If Thanos gets me...

657
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,789
I want you to promise me...

658
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:10,958
You'll kill me.

659
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:12,710
What?

660
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,257
I know something he doesn't.

661
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,012
And if he finds it out,

662
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,535
the entire universe could be at risk.

663
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,224
What do you know?

664
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,434
If I tell you, you'd know too.

665
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,314
If it's so important...

666
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,440
Shouldn't I?

667
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:35,816
Only if you wanna die.

668
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,103
Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?

669
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:39,987
Just...

670
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,409
Trust me. And possibly kill me.

671
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,912
I mean, I'd like to.

672
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,914
I really would. But you...

673
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,290
Swear to me.

674
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:57,088
Swear to me on your mother.

675
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,096
Okay.

676
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,311
Okay.

677
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:29,578
- Oh. - Dude.

678
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:31,205
How long have you been standing there?

679
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,290
An hour.

680
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,083
An hour?

681
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,918
Are you serious?

682
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,254
I've mastered the ability

683
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:41,007
of standing so incredibly still...

684
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,802
That I become invisible to the eye.

685
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:46,429
Watch.

686
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,934
You're eating a zarg-nut.

687
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,811
But my movement...

688
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,272
Was so slow...

689
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:58,941
That it's imperceptible.

690
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,109
Mmm, no.

691
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,528
I'm sure I'm invisible.

692
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:03,863
Mantis: Hi, drax.

693
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:07,575
Damn it.

694
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,221
This place looks deserted.

695
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:32,141
I'm reading movement in the third quadrant.

696
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,226
Peter: Yep, I'm picking that up too.

697
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,104
Let's put down right here.

698
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,409
The collector: I don't have it.

699
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,246
Thanos: Everyone in the galaxy knows

700
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,748
you'd sell your own brother...

701
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:57,684
If you thought it would add even the slightest trinket...

702
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,627
To your pathetic collection.

703
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,845
I know you have the reality stone, tivan.

704
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:14,266
Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.

705
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,105
The collector: I told you.

706
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,898
I sold it.

707
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:25,778
Why would I lie?

708
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,155
I imagine it's like breathing for you.

709
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,699
Like suicide.

710
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,368
You do understand.

711
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,330
Not even you would surrender something so precious.

712
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:37,873
I didn't know what it was.

713
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,835
Then you're more of a fool than I took you for.

714
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,211
It's him.

715
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:43,838
Thanos: Last chance, charlatan.

716
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:47,341
Where's the stone?

717
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:48,509
Today...

718
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:49,927
Drax. Drax.

719
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,054
He pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.

720
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:53,180
Drax, wait.

721
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,058
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

722
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:57,476
Drax.

723
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,607
Drax, drax, drax. Listen to me.

724
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,026
He doesn't have the stone yet.

725
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,820
If we get it, then we can stop him.

726
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,824
We have to get the stone first. Yeah.

727
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:16,287
No. For ovette, for camaria.

728
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,038
Sleep.

729
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:30,968
Okay.

730
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:35,222
Gamora, mantis, you go right.

731
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:37,850
The other right.

732
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:17,932
Why you, daughter?

733
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,576
That was quick.

734
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:48,254
Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!

735
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,300
Thanos: Is that sadness lsense in you, daughter?

736
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,931
In my heart, I knew you still cared.

737
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,567
But one never knows for sure.

738
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,620
Reality is often disappointing.

739
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,042
That is, it was.

740
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,462
Now...

741
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:35,259
Reality can be whatever I want.

742
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,262
You knew I'd come.

743
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,055
Thanos: I counted on it.

744
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,767
There's something we need to discuss, little one.

745
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:50,107
Thanos!

746
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,705
Let her go, grimace.

747
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,165
Gamora: Peter.

748
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,876
I told you to go right.

749
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,836
Now? Really?

750
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,421
You let her go!

751
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,548
Ah, the boyfriend.

752
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:17,051
Like to think of myself

753
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,595
more as a titan-killing, long-term Booty call.

754
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,805
- Let her go. - Peter.

755
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:26,685
I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin right off your face.

756
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,771
Not him.

757
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,951
You promised. You promised.

758
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,332
Thanos: Oh, daughter.

759
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,293
You expect too much from him.

760
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,465
She's asked, hasn't she?

761
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,428
Do it.

762
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:06,517
Mmm.

763
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:09,186
Do it!

764
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:17,361
I told you to go right.

765
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:22,282
I love you more than anything.

766
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:26,912
I love you too.

767
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,261
I like him.

768
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,019
Secretary Ross: Still no word from vision?

769
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,671
Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.

770
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,339
On a stolen quinjet

771
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,263
with four of the world's most wanted criminals.

772
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,260
You know they're only criminals because

773
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,988
you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?

774
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,138
My god, rhodes.

775
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:29,516
Your talent for horseshit rivals my own.

776
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,869
If it weren't for those accords,

777
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:32,269
vision would've been right here.

778
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,231
I remember your signature on those papers, colonel.

779
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:37,733
That's right.

780
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,570
And I'm pretty sure I paid for that.

781
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:42,946
You have second thoughts?

782
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,823
Not anymore.

783
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,247
Mr. Secretary.

784
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,462
You got some nerve.

785
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,756
I'll give you that.

786
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:02,674
You could use some of that right now.

787
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:05,761
The world's on fire.

788
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,640
And you think all is forgiven?

789
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,100
I'm not looking for forgiveness.

790
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,311
And I'm way past asking permission.

791
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,315
Earth just lost her best defender.

792
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,025
So we're here to fight.

793
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,529
And if you wanna stand in our way...

794
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,448
We'll fight you too.

795
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,702
Arrest them.

796
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,413
All over it.

797
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,878
That's a court-martial.

798
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,419
It's great to see you, cap.

799
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,218
You too, Rhodey.

800
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,302
Hey.

801
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:50,931
Wow. You guys...

802
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,767
Really look like crap.

803
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:55,519
Must've been a rough couple years.

804
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,355
Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.

805
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:00,983
Banner: Uh, I think you look great.

806
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,117
Yeah, I'm back.

807
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:12,786
Hi, Bruce.

808
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,334
Nat.

809
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,298
This is awkward.

810
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,486
So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?

811
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,678
And they can clearly find us.

812
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:32,055
We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?

813
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,807
After the whole accords situation,

814
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,572
he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough

815
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,245
on their families. They're on house arrest.

816
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:38,562
- Banner: Who's Scott? - Ant-man.

817
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,188
There's an ant-man and a spider-man?

818
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,149
Okay, look.

819
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,068
Thanos has the biggest army in the universe...

820
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,655
And he is not gonna stop until he gets...

821
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,533
Vision's stone.

822
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,951
Then we have to protect it.

823
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,745
No, we have to destroy it.

824
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,266
I've been giving a good deal of thought

825
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,330
to this entity in my head.

826
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,959
About its nature.

827
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,670
But also its composition.

828
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,839
I think if it were exposed

829
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:07,758
to a sufficiently powerful energy source...

830
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:11,762
Something very similar to its own signature, perhaps...

831
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,515
Its molecular integrity could fail.

832
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:18,310
Yeah, and you with it.

833
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,228
We're not having this conversation.

834
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,397
Vision: Eliminating the stone is the only way

835
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,483
to be certain that Thanos can't get it.

836
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:27,235
That's too high a price.

837
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,117
Only you have the power to pay it.

838
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:40,415
Thanos threatens half the universe.

839
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:43,126
One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.

840
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,711
But it should.

841
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,590
We don't trade lives, vision.

842
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:50,717
Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life...

843
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,678
To save how many millions of people?

844
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,888
Tell me, why is this any different?

845
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:57,349
Banner: Because you might have a choice.

846
00:57:58,642 --> 00:57:59,977
Your mind is made up

847
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,437
of a complex construct of overlays.

848
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:06,191
Jarvis, ultron, Tony, me, the stone.

849
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:08,110
All of them mixed together,

850
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,695
all of them learning from one another.

851
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,822
You're saying vision isn't just the stone?

852
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:15,075
I'm saying that if we take out the stone...

853
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,719
There's still a whole lot of vision left.

854
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,203
Perhaps the best parts.

855
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:19,871
Can we do that?

856
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,623
Not me, not here.

857
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,167
Rhodes: Well, you better find someone

858
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:25,419
and somewhere fast.

859
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,962
Ross isn'tjust gonna let you guys

860
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,255
have your old rooms back.

861
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,884
I know somewhere.

862
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,775
Okoye: The kingsguard

863
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,294
and the dora milaje have been alerted.

864
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,862
And the border tribe?

865
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,905
Those that are left.

866
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,324
Send word to the Jabari as well.

867
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,577
M'Baku likes a good fight.

868
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:02,581
And what of this one?

869
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,333
This one may be tired of war.

870
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,712
But the white wolf has rested long enough.

871
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,944
Where's the fight?

872
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:35,280
On its way.

873
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:56,259
In all the time I've served Thanos...

874
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,138
I have never failed him.

875
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:08,313
If I were to reach our rendezvous on titan...

876
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,065
With the time stone still attached

877
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,317
to your vaguely irritating person...

878
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:15,070
There would be judgment.

879
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:25,205
Give me...

880
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,043
The stone.

881
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:43,890
Wow, you're a seriously

882
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,201
loyal piece of outennear, aren't you?

883
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:47,269
Spider-man: Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...

884
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:48,812
Stark: What the...

885
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,873
- I know what you're gonna say. - You should not be here.

886
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,083
- I was gonna go home. - I don't wanna hear it.

887
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:53,167
But it was such a long way down and I just thought

888
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,502
- about you on the way... - And now I gotta hear it.

889
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:55,670
And kinda stuck to the side of the ship.

890
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:57,737
And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way.

891
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:58,905
God damn it.

892
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,867
So, if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.

893
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,511
- What did you just say? - I take that back.

894
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:04,828
And now, I'm here in space.

895
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:07,414
Yeah, right where I didn't want you to be.

896
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:09,666
This isn't coney island. This isn't a field trip.

897
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,084
This is a one-way ticket.

898
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:12,770
You hear me? Don't pretend you thought this through.

899
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:13,855
No, I did think this through.

900
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,648
You could not have possibly thought this through.

901
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,316
You can't be a friendly neighborhood spider-man...

902
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,925
If there's no neighborhood.

903
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,280
Okay, that didn't really make sense,

904
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:23,704
but you know what I'm trying to say.

905
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,643
Come on. We got a situation.

906
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:30,705
See him down there? He's in trouble.

907
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:31,730
What's your plan?

908
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:32,981
-Um...

909
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,066
Okay, okay... uh...

910
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,570
Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, aliens?

911
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:44,367
Ebony maw: Painful, aren't they?

912
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,121
They were originally designed for microsurgery.

913
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,874
And any one of them...

914
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,173
Could end your friend's life in an instant.

915
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,526
Iron man: I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend.

916
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,220
Saving his life is more of a professional courtesy.

917
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:06,765
You've saved nothing.

918
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,643
Your powers are inconsequential

919
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,936
compared to mine.

920
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:12,979
Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.

921
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,329
Spider-man: Yes! Wait. What are those?

922
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,680
Spider-man: Hey, we haven't officially met.

923
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,057
Cool.

924
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,519
We gotta turn this ship around.

925
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:54,688
Stark: Yeah, now he wants to run. Great plan.

926
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,231
No, I want to protect the stone.

927
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:57,667
Stark: And I want you to thank me.

928
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,192
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

929
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,070
Dr. Strange: For what? Nearly blasting me into space?

930
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:04,489
Who just saved your magical ass? Me.

931
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:05,657
I seriously don't know

932
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,051
how you fit your head into that helmet.

933
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:09,327
Admit it, you should've ducked out when I told you to.

934
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:10,996
I tried to bench you. You refused.

935
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:13,224
Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.

936
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:14,833
And due to that fact,

937
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,251
we're now in a flying doughnut...

938
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:18,138
Billions of miles from earth with no backup.

939
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:20,171
- I'm backup. - No, you're a stowaway.

940
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,339
The adults are talking.

941
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:24,092
I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here.

942
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:25,885
What is he, your ward?

943
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:29,431
- I'm Peter, by the way. - Doctor strange.

944
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,308
Oh, you're using our made-up names. Um...

945
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:33,518
I'm spider-man, then.

946
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:35,996
This ship is self-correcting its course.

947
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:37,022
Thing's on autopilot.

948
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,898
Dr. Strange: Can we control it?

949
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,984
Fly us home?

950
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:44,988
- Stark? - Yeah.

951
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:46,406
Can you get us home?

952
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:47,824
Yeah, I heard you.

953
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:51,578
I'm thinking I'm not so sure we should.

954
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,747
Under no circumstances

955
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,374
can we bring the time stone to Thanos.

956
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:57,768
I don't think you quite understand

957
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:58,793
what's at stake here.

958
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,296
What? No. It's you who doesn't understand...

959
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:04,215
That Thanos has been inside my head for six years.

960
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,967
Since he sent an army to New York

961
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:07,594
and now he's back.

962
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:09,679
And I don't know what to do.

963
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,014
So I'm not so sure

964
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:13,034
if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his...

965
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:16,686
But you saw what they did, what they can do.

966
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,064
At least on his turf, he's not expecting it.

967
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,983
So I say we take the fight to him.

968
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,151
Doctor.

969
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,529
Do you concur?

970
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:31,576
All right, stark. We go to him.

971
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,704
But you have to understand...

972
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,539
If it comes to saving you

973
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,084
or the kid or the time stone...

974
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,087
I will not hesitate to let either of you die.

975
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:46,591
I can't, because the universe depends on it.

976
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:50,053
Nice. Good, moral compass.

977
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:52,847
We're straight.

978
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,475
All right, kid.

979
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:57,811
You're an avenger now.

980
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:36,683
Thanos: I thought you might be hungry.

981
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,405
I always hated that chair.

982
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:52,615
Thanos: So I've been told.

983
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:57,203
Even so, I'd hoped you'd sit in it one day.

984
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,497
I hated this room.

985
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,666
This ship.

986
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,626
I hated my life.

987
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,300
Thanos: You told me that too.

988
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:14,846
Every day.

989
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,601
For almost 20 years.

990
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:24,564
I was a child when you took me.

991
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,774
I saved you.

992
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,326
No. We were happy on my home planet.

993
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:37,660
Going to bed hungry...

994
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:39,871
Scrounging for scraps.

995
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:42,916
Your planet was on the brink of collapse.

996
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,084
I'm the one who stopped that.

997
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,378
Do you know what's happened since then?

998
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:49,172
The children born...

999
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:53,176
Have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies.

1000
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,594
It's a paradise.

1001
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,140
Because you murdered half the planet.

1002
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:02,185
A small price to pay for salvation.

1003
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:03,353
You're insane.

1004
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,480
Little one, it's a simple calculus.

1005
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:08,441
This universe is finite, its resources finite.

1006
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:12,987
If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist.

1007
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:14,489
It needs correction.

1008
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,032
You don't know that!

1009
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,619
I'm the only one who knows that.

1010
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:24,624
At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.

1011
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,210
For a time...

1012
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:34,050
You had that same will...

1013
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,054
As you fought by my side.

1014
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:39,973
Daughter.

1015
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:42,559
I'm not your daughter.

1016
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:47,730
Everything I hate about myself you taught me.

1017
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:49,941
And, in doing so,

1018
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:52,277
made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy.

1019
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:58,032
That's why I trusted you to find the soul stone.

1020
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:03,871
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1021
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:07,208
I am disappointed.

1022
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:10,461
But not because you didn't find it.

1023
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,800
But because you did.

1024
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,012
And you lied.

1025
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,238
Gamora: Nebula.

1026
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:45,830
Don't do this.

1027
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:47,206
Thanos: Some time ago,

1028
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:50,001
your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.

1029
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:51,169
Please don't do this.

1030
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,546
Thanos: And very nearly succeeded.

1031
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:55,673
So I brought her here.

1032
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:58,468
To talk.

1033
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,519
Stop. Stop it.

1034
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,736
I swear to you on my life.

1035
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:19,530
I never found the soul stone.

1036
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,244
N e b u la: Accessing memory files.

1037
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:26,746
You know what he's about to do.

1038
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:29,499
He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones.

1039
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:30,893
- All of them. - He can never get them all.

1040
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:31,918
Nebula: He will!

1041
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,961
He can't, nebula.

1042
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:36,464
Because I found the map to the soul stone...

1043
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:39,425
And I burned it to ash. I burned it.

1044
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:46,265
You're strong.

1045
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,481
You're generous.

1046
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:00,238
But I never taught you to lie.

1047
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:03,032
That's why you're so bad at it.

1048
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:09,789
Where is the soul stone?

1049
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:28,182
Vormir!

1050
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:47,910
The stone is on vormir.

1051
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,416
Show me.

1052
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:56,836
Groot: I am groot.

1053
01:10:57,003 --> 01:10:58,129
Rocket: Tinkle in the cup.

1054
01:10:58,212 --> 01:10:59,690
We're not looking. What's there to see?

1055
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:01,883
What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig before.

1056
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:03,134
I am groot.

1057
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:04,403
Tree, pour what's in the cup

1058
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:05,947
out into space and go in the cup again.

1059
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,430
You speak groot?

1060
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:09,533
Yes, they taught it on asgard. It was an elective.

1061
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:10,600
I am groot.

1062
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:12,769
You'll know when we're close.

1063
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,520
Nidavellir's forge harnesses

1064
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,814
the blazing power of a neutron star.

1065
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:21,652
It's the birthplace of my hammer.

1066
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:24,113
It's truly awesome.

1067
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:33,289
Okay, time to be the captain.

1068
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,837
So, dead brother, huh?

1069
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:42,340
Yeah, that could be annoying.

1070
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,717
Well, he's been dead before.

1071
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:48,721
But, no, this time I think it really might be true.

1072
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,516
And you said your sister and your dad?

1073
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:52,975
Both dead.

1074
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:55,269
But still got a mom, though?

1075
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:57,021
Killed by a dark elf.

1076
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:58,189
A best friend?

1077
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,649
Stabbed through the heart.

1078
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:06,197
You sure you're up to this particular murder mission?

1079
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:09,909
Absolutely.

1080
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:13,579
Rage and vengeance, anger, loss, regret...

1081
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:15,331
They're all tremendous motivators.

1082
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:16,494
They really clear the mind.

1083
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:18,209
So I'm good to go.

1084
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:21,045
Yeah, but this Thanos we're talkin' about...

1085
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:23,798
He's the toughest there is.

1086
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:26,008
- Well, he's never fought me. - Yeah, he has.

1087
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,718
He's never fought me twice.

1088
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,096
And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.

1089
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,515
It better be some hammer.

1090
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:39,021
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

1091
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,732
I've killed twice as many enemies as that.

1092
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:43,860
And every one of them would've rather killed me,

1093
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:44,944
but none succeeded.

1094
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:48,531
I'm only alive because fate wants me alive.

1095
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:51,492
Thanos is just the latest in a long line of bastards...

1096
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:53,536
And he'll be the latest to feel my vengeance.

1097
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,496
Fate wills it so.

1098
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:56,914
Mmm-hmm.

1099
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:58,833
And what if you're wrong?

1100
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:03,921
If I'm wrong, then...

1101
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,757
What more could I lose?

1102
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:21,939
I could lose a lot.

1103
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,150
Me, personally, I could lose a lot.

1104
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:28,946
Okay.

1105
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:34,118
If fate does want you to kill that crapsack...

1106
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:36,125
You're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.

1107
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:38,164
- What's this? - What's it look like?

1108
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:40,917
Some jerk lost a bet with me on contraxia.

1109
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,335
He gave you his eye?

1110
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:43,628
No, he gave me 100 credits.

1111
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:46,756
I snuck into his room later that night and stole his eye.

1112
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:49,926
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

1113
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:51,010
Hmm.

1114
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:00,895
I would've washed that.

1115
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:03,481
The only way I could sneak it off contraxia was up my...

1116
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:05,900
Hey, we're here!

1117
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:11,144
I don't think this thing works.

1118
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:12,365
Everything seems dark.

1119
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:16,535
Rocket: It ain't the eye.

1120
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,258
Something's wrong.

1121
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:33,594
The star's gone out.

1122
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,013
And the rings are frozen.

1123
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:58,679
Rocket: I hope these dwarves are better

1124
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:00,454
at forging than they are cleaning.

1125
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:07,294
Maybe they realized that they live

1126
01:15:07,378 --> 01:15:08,818
in ajunk pile in the middle of space.

1127
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:11,924
This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries.

1128
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:16,846
You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?

1129
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:18,180
Thor: Yes, why?

1130
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,391
Rocket: It look anything like that?

1131
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:25,563
I am groot.

1132
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:27,231
Go back to the pod.

1133
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,278
Eitri, wait!

1134
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:34,280
Stop!

1135
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:36,198
Stop.

1136
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:37,908
Thor?

1137
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:42,621
What happened here?

1138
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:45,332
You were supposed to protect us.

1139
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,878
Asgard was supposed to protect us.

1140
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:51,255
Asgard is destroyed.

1141
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:57,344
Eitri, the glove. What did you do?

1142
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:13,110
300 dwarves lived on this ring.

1143
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:17,406
I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe.

1144
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,368
I made what he wanted.

1145
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:27,416
A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones.

1146
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:34,548
Then he killed everyone anyway.

1147
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:38,427
All except me.

1148
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:41,388
"Your life is yours," he said.

1149
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:46,644
"Butyourhands are mine alone."

1150
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,605
Eitri, this isn't about your hands.

1151
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:52,316
Every weapon you've ever designed,

1152
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:53,818
every axe, hammer, sword...

1153
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:56,195
It's all inside your head.

1154
01:16:57,071 --> 01:16:58,989
Now, I know it feels like all hope is lost.

1155
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:00,699
Trust me, I know.

1156
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:05,871
But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.

1157
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,664
Mantis, listen very carefully.

1158
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:51,041
I need you to meet me on titan.

1159
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:58,859
Spider-man: Hey, what's going on?

1160
01:17:58,883 --> 01:18:00,163
Dr. Strange: I think we're here.

1161
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:02,720
I don't think this rig has a self-park function.

1162
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:06,071
Get your hand inside the steering gimbal.

1163
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,141
Close those around it.

1164
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:09,995
- You understand? - Yep, got it.

1165
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:11,371
This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta

1166
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:13,155
- move at the same time. - Okay, okay. Ready.

1167
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:18,837
We might wanna turn.

1168
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:20,112
Turn! Turn! Turn!

1169
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,560
You all right?

1170
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:54,313
Stark: That was close.

1171
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:56,941
I owe you one.

1172
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:59,526
Let me just say, if aliens

1173
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,504
wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something...

1174
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:02,797
And I eat one of you, I'm sorry.

1175
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:05,157
I do not want another single pop culture reference

1176
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:06,885
out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?

1177
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:08,589
I'm trying to say that something is coming.

1178
01:19:15,793 --> 01:19:16,877
Drax: Thanos!

1179
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:39,692
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't put your eggs in me!

1180
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,654
Peter quill: Stay down, clown.

1181
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:50,953
Drax: Die, blanket of death!

1182
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:59,795
Peter: Everybody stay where you are. Chill the eff out.

1183
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:03,007
I'm gonna ask you this one time.

1184
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:05,009
Where is gamora?

1185
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:07,678
Yeah. I'll do you one better. Who's gamora?

1186
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,764
I'll do you one better. Why is gamora?

1187
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:12,850
Tell me where the girl is or I swear to you

1188
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:14,327
I'm gonna French fry this little freak.

1189
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:17,187
Let's do it. You shoot my guy and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1190
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:20,357
Do it, quill! I can take it.

1191
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:22,526
- No, he can't take it! - She's right. You can't.

1192
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:24,879
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine.

1193
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:25,946
I'll kill all three of you

1194
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,865
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself.

1195
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:29,033
Starting with you.

1196
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:30,200
Wait, what, Thanos?

1197
01:20:30,284 --> 01:20:32,369
All right, let me ask you this one time.

1198
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:34,538
What master do you serve?

1199
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:35,956
What master do I serve?

1200
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,499
What am I supposed to say, "Jesus"?

1201
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:39,460
You're from earth.

1202
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:40,645
I'm not from earth, I'm from Missouri.

1203
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,147
Stark: Yeah, that's on earth, dipshit.

1204
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:43,331
What are you hassling us for?

1205
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,132
Spider-man: So you're not with Thanos?

1206
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:47,426
With Thanos?

1207
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:50,596
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

1208
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:52,598
He took my girl. Wait, who are you?

1209
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:55,142
- We're the avengers, man. - Oh.

1210
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:57,519
You're the ones Thor told us about.

1211
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:58,854
You know Thor?

1212
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:00,105
Yeah.

1213
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:02,649
Tall guy, not that good-looking, needed saving.

1214
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:04,485
Where is he now?

1215
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,541
This is the plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?

1216
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:22,795
It's a mold.

1217
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:24,546
A king's weapon.

1218
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:27,841
Meant to be the greatest in asgard.

1219
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:31,345
In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.

1220
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:32,971
Did it have a name?

1221
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,391
Storm breaker.

1222
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:36,975
That's a bit much.

1223
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:40,104
So how do we make it?

1224
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:44,149
You'll have to restart the forge.

1225
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:47,319
Awaken the heart of a dying star.

1226
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:52,574
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1227
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:58,205
Peter: The hell happened to this planet?

1228
01:21:58,372 --> 01:22:00,165
It's eight degrees off its axis.

1229
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:02,459
Gravitational pull is all over the place.

1230
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:06,588
Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us.

1231
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:10,175
We'll use it. All right, I have a plan.

1232
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:11,662
Or at least the beginnings of one.

1233
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,120
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,

1234
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:14,418
pin him down, get what we need.

1235
01:22:14,555 --> 01:22:16,235
Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy.

1236
01:22:16,306 --> 01:22:17,349
We just want the gauntlet.

1237
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:20,310
Are you yawning?

1238
01:22:20,394 --> 01:22:22,563
In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh?

1239
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:23,689
Did you hear what I said?

1240
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:26,775
I stopped listening after you said, "we need a plan."

1241
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,169
Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.

1242
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:31,029
See, "not winging it" isn't really what they do.

1243
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:32,698
Uh, what exactly is it that they do?

1244
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,450
Kick names, take ass.

1245
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:35,868
Yeah, that's right.

1246
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:44,063
All right, just get over here, please.

1247
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:46,253
Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?

1248
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,589
"Mr. Lord." Star-lord is fine.

1249
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:52,593
Stark: We gotta coalesce.

1250
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:54,529
'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude...

1251
01:22:54,553 --> 01:22:56,847
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1252
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:58,182
We don't know what it means.

1253
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:01,185
All right, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan.

1254
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:03,812
Except it sucks, so let me do the plan...

1255
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:05,898
And that way it might be really good.

1256
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:08,025
Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.

1257
01:23:08,192 --> 01:23:10,319
- Stark: What dance-off? - It's nothing.

1258
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:11,646
Like in footloose, the movie?

1259
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:13,071
Exactly like footloose.

1260
01:23:13,614 --> 01:23:15,254
Is it still the greatest movie in history?

1261
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:16,408
Spider-man: It never was.

1262
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:17,677
Stark: Don't encourage this, all right?

1263
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:18,994
- Okay. - We're getting no help

1264
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:20,677
- from flash Gordon here. - Flash Gordon?

1265
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:22,026
By the way, that's a compliment.

1266
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:23,957
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1267
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:25,667
So that 50% of me that's stupid...

1268
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:27,878
That's 100% you.

1269
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:29,355
Stark: Your math is blowing my mind.

1270
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:30,672
Mantis: Excuse me.

1271
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:35,093
But does your friend often do that?

1272
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,805
Strange, we all right?

1273
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:50,210
You're back. You're all right.

1274
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:52,027
- Dr. Strange: Hi. - Hey, what was that?

1275
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:56,198
Iwent fonnard in time to view alternate futures.

1276
01:23:57,074 --> 01:23:58,617
To see all the possible outcomes

1277
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,536
of the coming conflict.

1278
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:02,621
How many did you see?

1279
01:24:02,788 --> 01:24:05,040
14,000,605.

1280
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,126
How many did we win?

1281
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,049
One.

1282
01:24:35,946 --> 01:24:38,949
Thanos: The stone had better be up there.

1283
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:42,869
For your sister's sake.

1284
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:08,520
Welcome, Thanos, son ofalars.

1285
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:13,859
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1286
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:15,193
Thanos: You know us?

1287
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:19,906
It is my curse to know all who journey here.

1288
01:25:20,407 --> 01:25:22,075
Where is the soul stone?

1289
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:24,453
You should know...

1290
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,248
It extracts a terrible price.

1291
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:31,168
I am prepared.

1292
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:36,048
We all think that at first.

1293
01:25:40,594 --> 01:25:42,888
We are all wrong.

1294
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,818
Thanos: How is it you know this place so well?

1295
01:25:56,985 --> 01:26:01,323
A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones.

1296
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:04,493
I even held one in my hand.

1297
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:08,705
But it cast me out, banished me here.

1298
01:26:08,872 --> 01:26:12,918
Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.

1299
01:26:21,635 --> 01:26:24,554
What you seek lies in front of you.

1300
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:27,641
As does what you fear.

1301
01:26:28,392 --> 01:26:29,851
What's this?

1302
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:31,895
Red skull: The price.

1303
01:26:32,062 --> 01:26:36,692
Soul holds a special place among the infinity stones.

1304
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:41,780
You might say it has a certain wisdom.

1305
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:44,991
Thanos: Tell me what it needs.

1306
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:48,704
Red skull: To ensure that whoever possesses it...

1307
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,415
Understands its power...

1308
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:56,128
The stone demands a sacrifice.

1309
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:57,838
Of what?

1310
01:26:58,255 --> 01:27:00,215
In order to take the stone,

1311
01:27:00,298 --> 01:27:02,718
you must lose that which you love.

1312
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:06,930
A soul...

1313
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:08,849
For a soul.

1314
01:27:24,573 --> 01:27:26,908
All my life, I dreamed of a day...

1315
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:29,244
A moment...

1316
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:32,664
When you got what you deserved.

1317
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:37,169
And I was always so disappointed.

1318
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:42,215
But now...

1319
01:27:46,178 --> 01:27:49,264
You kill and torture...

1320
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:53,226
And you call it mercy.

1321
01:27:57,314 --> 01:27:59,399
The universe has judged you.

1322
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:05,447
You asked it for a prize, and it told you no.

1323
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,492
You failed.

1324
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:11,745
And do you wanna know why?

1325
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,539
Because you love nothing.

1326
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:16,875
No one.

1327
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:29,304
Really?

1328
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:31,431
Tears?

1329
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:34,184
They're not for him.

1330
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:49,658
Gamora: No.

1331
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,577
This isn't love.

1332
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:56,122
I ignored my destiny once.

1333
01:28:58,583 --> 01:29:00,752
I cannot do that again.

1334
01:29:01,253 --> 01:29:04,631
Even for you.

1335
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:31,199
I'm sorry, little one.

1336
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:16,721
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1337
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:18,139
I hope you're right about this.

1338
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:21,184
Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to.

1339
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:38,344
When you said we were going to open wakanda

1340
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,448
to the rest of the world...

1341
01:31:39,619 --> 01:31:41,830
This is not what I imagined.

1342
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:43,957
And what did you imagine?

1343
01:31:44,124 --> 01:31:45,250
The Olympics.

1344
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:47,168
Maybe even a Starbucks.

1345
01:32:01,391 --> 01:32:02,767
Should we bow?

1346
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:04,185
Yeah, he's a king.

1347
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:06,521
Seems like I'm always thanking you for something.

1348
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:09,816
What are you doing?

1349
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:11,901
Uh, we don't do that here.

1350
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:14,320
So how big of an assault should we expect?

1351
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:17,490
Uh, sir, I think you should expect quite a big assault.

1352
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:18,658
How we looking?

1353
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:20,702
You will have my kingsguard,

1354
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:23,747
the border tribe, the dora milaje, and...

1355
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:27,625
And a semi-stable 100-year-old man.

1356
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:31,671
How you been, buck?

1357
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:34,966
Uh, not bad, for the end of the world.

1358
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:48,063
Banner: Whoa.

1359
01:32:48,146 --> 01:32:50,231
The structure is polymorphic.

1360
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:53,568
Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.

1361
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:55,820
Why didn't you just reprogram

1362
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:58,031
the synapses to work collectively?

1363
01:32:59,115 --> 01:33:02,368
Because we didn't think of it.

1364
01:33:02,786 --> 01:33:04,079
I'm sure you did your best.

1365
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:05,455
Can you do it?

1366
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:09,667
Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here.

1367
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:13,004
One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures.

1368
01:33:13,379 --> 01:33:14,464
It will take time, brother.

1369
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:17,217
How long?

1370
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,510
As long as you can give me.

1371
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:25,391
Something's entered the atmosphere.

1372
01:33:42,242 --> 01:33:44,536
Hey, cap, we got a situation here.

1373
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:55,880
God, I love this place.

1374
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:57,733
War machine Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys.

1375
01:33:57,757 --> 01:33:59,676
We got more incoming outside the dome.

1376
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:19,988
Vision: It's too late.

1377
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:22,310
We need to destroy the stone now.

1378
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:24,492
Vision, get your ass back on the table.

1379
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:25,994
We will hold them off.

1380
01:34:26,161 --> 01:34:29,581
Wanda, as soon as that stone's out of his head...

1381
01:34:29,747 --> 01:34:30,748
You blow it to hell.

1382
01:34:31,166 --> 01:34:32,250
I will.

1383
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:35,211
Evacuate the city. Engage all defenses.

1384
01:34:35,962 --> 01:34:37,422
And get this man a shield.

1385
01:34:47,849 --> 01:34:48,993
Rocket: I don't think

1386
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:50,177
you get the scientifics here.

1387
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:52,770
These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving...

1388
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:54,373
You're gonna need something a lot bigger

1389
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:55,440
to yank 'em loose.

1390
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:57,650
- Leave that to me. - Leave it to you?

1391
01:34:57,817 --> 01:35:00,945
Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a...

1392
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:10,431
Thor: Fire the engines!

1393
01:35:27,931 --> 01:35:30,600
More power, rabbit!

1394
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,841
Well done, boy.

1395
01:36:05,635 --> 01:36:07,553
That's nidavellir.

1396
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:28,616
Damn it.

1397
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:30,576
"Damn it"? What's "damn it"?

1398
01:36:30,743 --> 01:36:32,161
Eitri: The mechanism is crippled.

1399
01:36:32,245 --> 01:36:33,663
- What? - With the Iris closed,

1400
01:36:33,746 --> 01:36:34,789
I can't heat the metal.

1401
01:36:34,956 --> 01:36:36,249
How long will it take to heat it?

1402
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:39,085
A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

1403
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:42,130
I'm gonna hold it open.

1404
01:36:42,297 --> 01:36:43,423
That's suicide.

1405
01:36:43,589 --> 01:36:46,009
So is facing Thanos without that axe.

1406
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:56,853
How we looking, Bruce?

1407
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:58,688
Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

1408
01:37:01,983 --> 01:37:04,068
Wow! This is amazing, man.

1409
01:37:04,152 --> 01:37:06,070
It's like being the hulk without actually...

1410
01:37:09,907 --> 01:37:12,118
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1411
01:37:13,619 --> 01:37:14,680
I've got two heat signatures

1412
01:37:14,704 --> 01:37:15,944
breaking through the tree line.

1413
01:37:44,150 --> 01:37:46,361
Thank you for standing with us.

1414
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:48,019
Of course, brother.

1415
01:38:08,341 --> 01:38:09,967
Where's your other friend?

1416
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:13,096
You will pay for his life with yours.

1417
01:38:14,097 --> 01:38:16,557
Thanos will have that stone.

1418
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:18,518
That's not gonna happen.

1419
01:38:18,684 --> 01:38:20,978
You are in wakanda now.

1420
01:38:21,145 --> 01:38:24,607
Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.

1421
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:29,737
We have blood to spare.

1422
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:42,708
They surrender?

1423
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:44,502
Not exactly.

1424
01:39:11,529 --> 01:39:12,947
What the hell?

1425
01:39:15,908 --> 01:39:17,535
Looks like we pissed her off.

1426
01:39:28,296 --> 01:39:29,839
They're killing themselves.

1427
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:07,723
Falcon: You see the teeth on those things?

1428
01:40:07,752 --> 01:40:08,753
All right, back up, Sam.

1429
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:10,196
You're gonna get your wings singed.

1430
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:23,827
Banner: Cap, if these things circle the perimeter

1431
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:24,894
and get in behind us...

1432
01:40:25,061 --> 01:40:26,854
There's nothing between them and vision.

1433
01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:28,981
Then we better keep 'em in front of us.

1434
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:30,525
How do we do that?

1435
01:40:32,902 --> 01:40:34,529
We open the barrier.

1436
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:40,910
On my signal, open north-west section seventeen.

1437
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:43,120
Dome control: Requesting confirmation, my king.

1438
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:44,872
You said open the barrier?

1439
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:46,249
On my signal.

1440
01:40:46,499 --> 01:40:48,376
This will be the end of wakanda.

1441
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:53,130
Then it will be the noblest ending in history.

1442
01:41:05,977 --> 01:41:07,562
Wakanda forever!

1443
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:20,992
Black panther: Now!

1444
01:41:51,314 --> 01:41:52,732
How much longer, shuri?

1445
01:41:52,898 --> 01:41:54,442
I've barely begun, brother.

1446
01:41:54,609 --> 01:41:56,444
You might want to pick up the pace.

1447
01:42:03,492 --> 01:42:05,369
Allfathers, give me strength.

1448
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:07,330
You understand, boy?

1449
01:42:07,496 --> 01:42:10,499
You're about to take the full force of a star.

1450
01:42:11,459 --> 01:42:12,877
It'll kill you.

1451
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:15,755
Only if I die.

1452
01:42:16,047 --> 01:42:17,048
Yes.

1453
01:42:17,548 --> 01:42:20,301
That's what killing you means.

1454
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:50,206
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

1455
01:43:40,673 --> 01:43:42,633
Thor! Say something. Come on.

1456
01:43:43,551 --> 01:43:44,552
Thor, you okay?

1457
01:43:50,224 --> 01:43:51,517
I think he's dying.

1458
01:43:51,684 --> 01:43:53,644
He needs the axe!

1459
01:43:55,104 --> 01:43:56,439
Where's the handle?

1460
01:43:59,483 --> 01:44:01,819
Tree, help me find the handle!

1461
01:45:10,679 --> 01:45:12,890
There's too many of 'em!

1462
01:45:39,375 --> 01:45:42,711
You guys are so screwed now!

1463
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:48,092
Bring me Thanos!

1464
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:22,334
Dr. Strange: Oh, yeah.

1465
01:46:25,462 --> 01:46:27,464
You're much more of a Thanos.

1466
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,969
I take it the maw is dead.

1467
01:46:34,263 --> 01:46:36,724
This day extracts a heavy toll.

1468
01:46:38,434 --> 01:46:40,603
Still, he accomplished his mission.

1469
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:42,563
You may regret that.

1470
01:46:43,397 --> 01:46:44,773
He brought you face-to-face

1471
01:46:44,857 --> 01:46:46,275
with the master of the mystic arts.

1472
01:46:49,445 --> 01:46:51,906
Thanos: And where do you think he brought you?

1473
01:46:52,990 --> 01:46:55,701
Let me guess. Your home?

1474
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,373
It was.

1475
01:47:04,126 --> 01:47:05,544
And it was beautiful.

1476
01:47:08,172 --> 01:47:10,633
Titan was like most planets.

1477
01:47:10,799 --> 01:47:13,677
Too many mouths, not enough to go around.

1478
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:17,097
And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.

1479
01:47:18,098 --> 01:47:19,308
Genocide.

1480
01:47:20,017 --> 01:47:24,104
But random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike.

1481
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:27,608
They called me a madman.

1482
01:47:28,317 --> 01:47:30,569
And what I predicted came to pass.

1483
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:35,282
Congratulations, you're a prophet.

1484
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:37,076
I'm a survivor.

1485
01:47:37,242 --> 01:47:39,453
Who wants to murder trillions.

1486
01:47:39,620 --> 01:47:43,332
With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers.

1487
01:47:43,874 --> 01:47:48,587
They would all cease to exist. I call that mercy.

1488
01:47:50,673 --> 01:47:52,174
And then what?

1489
01:47:53,509 --> 01:47:55,010
I'd finally rest...

1490
01:47:55,803 --> 01:47:58,931
And watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.

1491
01:48:00,099 --> 01:48:03,644
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.

1492
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:09,191
I think you'll find our will equal to yours.

1493
01:48:10,609 --> 01:48:11,610
Our?

1494
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:19,118
Piece of cake, quill.

1495
01:48:19,284 --> 01:48:21,537
Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off.

1496
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:00,909
Boom!

1497
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:03,871
Don't let him close his fist.

1498
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:09,084
Spider-man: Magic.

1499
01:49:09,710 --> 01:49:10,711
More magic.

1500
01:49:11,545 --> 01:49:12,546
Magic with a kick.

1501
01:49:13,172 --> 01:49:14,173
Magic with a...

1502
01:49:15,507 --> 01:49:16,800
Insect!

1503
01:49:54,213 --> 01:49:55,339
Well, well.

1504
01:49:55,506 --> 01:49:56,548
You should've killed me.

1505
01:49:56,715 --> 01:49:58,425
It would've been a waste of parts!

1506
01:50:04,056 --> 01:50:05,182
Where's gamora?

1507
01:50:46,515 --> 01:50:47,700
Iron man: Is he under? Don't let up.

1508
01:50:47,724 --> 01:50:50,352
Be quick. He is very strong.

1509
01:50:50,519 --> 01:50:52,563
Parker, help! Get over here.

1510
01:50:52,729 --> 01:50:55,065
She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

1511
01:51:00,529 --> 01:51:01,673
Spider-man: We gotta open his fingers to get it off.

1512
01:51:01,697 --> 01:51:02,882
I thought you'd be hard to catch.

1513
01:51:02,906 --> 01:51:04,186
For the record, this was my plan.

1514
01:51:05,450 --> 01:51:07,161
You're not so strong now, huh?

1515
01:51:07,661 --> 01:51:09,413
Where is gamora?

1516
01:51:09,496 --> 01:51:11,456
My gamora.

1517
01:51:11,623 --> 01:51:13,667
Peter: No, bullshit!

1518
01:51:13,959 --> 01:51:15,252
Where is she?

1519
01:51:16,336 --> 01:51:17,629
Mantis: He is in anguish.

1520
01:51:18,338 --> 01:51:20,340
Good.

1521
01:51:20,424 --> 01:51:22,759
He... he mourns.

1522
01:51:23,302 --> 01:51:26,930
Drax: What does this monster have to mourn?

1523
01:51:27,639 --> 01:51:28,724
Nebula: Gamora.

1524
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:33,604
What?

1525
01:51:34,021 --> 01:51:35,522
He took her to vormir.

1526
01:51:36,148 --> 01:51:38,108
He came back with the soul stone.

1527
01:51:38,901 --> 01:51:40,402
But she didn't.

1528
01:51:42,321 --> 01:51:45,490
Okay, quill, you gotta cool it right now. You understand?

1529
01:51:46,366 --> 01:51:49,828
Don't, don't. Don't engage. We almost got this off!

1530
01:51:51,079 --> 01:51:52,080
Tell me she's lying.

1531
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:57,336
Asshole, tell me you didn't do it!

1532
01:51:58,795 --> 01:52:02,216
I had to.

1533
01:52:02,966 --> 01:52:04,384
No, you didn't.

1534
01:52:04,468 --> 01:52:06,261
No, you didn't.

1535
01:52:10,098 --> 01:52:11,433
- No, you didn't! - Stark: Quill!

1536
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:13,393
Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop!

1537
01:52:14,102 --> 01:52:15,205
Hey, stop! Stop!

1538
01:52:15,229 --> 01:52:17,469
Spider-man: It's coming, it's coming. I got it, I got it!

1539
01:52:20,692 --> 01:52:21,693
Oh, god.

1540
01:53:20,168 --> 01:53:23,255
Come and get some, space dogs!

1541
01:53:26,591 --> 01:53:29,177
Come on! Get some! Get some!

1542
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:31,263
Come on! Get some!

1543
01:53:31,513 --> 01:53:33,557
- How much for the gun? - Not for sale.

1544
01:53:34,182 --> 01:53:36,059
Okay. How much for the arm?

1545
01:53:37,936 --> 01:53:39,938
Oh, I'll get that arm.

1546
01:53:48,822 --> 01:53:49,823
New haircut?

1547
01:53:50,198 --> 01:53:51,491
Noticed you've copied my beard.

1548
01:53:54,119 --> 01:53:55,871
By the way, this is a friend of mine, tree.

1549
01:53:56,788 --> 01:53:58,707
I am groot.

1550
01:53:59,708 --> 01:54:01,168
I am Steve Rogers.

1551
01:54:21,229 --> 01:54:23,398
Black panther: Fall back! Fall back, now!

1552
01:54:32,824 --> 01:54:34,534
Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.

1553
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:36,244
Falcon: I'm doing it.

1554
01:55:00,143 --> 01:55:01,770
Why was she up there all this time?

1555
01:55:02,729 --> 01:55:05,607
She's on the field. Take it.

1556
01:55:37,222 --> 01:55:39,349
Guys, we got a vision situation here.

1557
01:55:42,102 --> 01:55:43,478
Somebody get to vision!

1558
01:55:44,229 --> 01:55:46,022
- Banner: I got him! - On my way.

1559
01:55:51,403 --> 01:55:54,239
He'll die alone. As will you.

1560
01:55:54,406 --> 01:55:55,699
Black widow: She's not alone.

1561
01:56:21,933 --> 01:56:23,643
Banner: Oh, no, you don't.

1562
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:25,330
This isn't gonna be like New York, pal.

1563
01:56:25,437 --> 01:56:27,731
This suit's already kicked the crap outta the hulk.

1564
01:56:27,898 --> 01:56:28,899
What? No! No!

1565
01:56:32,652 --> 01:56:35,363
Guys! Vision needs backup, now!

1566
01:56:37,365 --> 01:56:38,950
Hulk? Hulk,

1567
01:56:39,034 --> 01:56:41,095
I know you like making your entrance at the last second.

1568
01:56:41,119 --> 01:56:43,747
Well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second.

1569
01:56:48,210 --> 01:56:49,753
Hulk! Hulk!

1570
01:56:50,629 --> 01:56:51,630
Hulk!

1571
01:56:52,797 --> 01:56:54,966
No!

1572
01:56:55,133 --> 01:56:57,886
Oh, screw you, you big, green asshole!

1573
01:56:58,053 --> 01:56:59,262
I'll do it myself!

1574
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:02,015
Come on! Yeah!

1575
01:57:14,361 --> 01:57:15,946
Banner: See ya!

1576
01:57:27,499 --> 01:57:30,001
Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.

1577
01:57:41,054 --> 01:57:42,931
I thought you were formidable, machine.

1578
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:46,434
But you're dying, like any man.

1579
01:57:55,026 --> 01:57:56,278
Get outta here!

1580
01:58:19,467 --> 01:58:21,136
That was really gross.

1581
01:58:48,288 --> 01:58:49,372
I thought I told you to go.

1582
01:58:50,915 --> 01:58:52,626
We don't trade lives, captain.

1583
01:59:04,179 --> 01:59:06,222
Spider-man: I got you. I got you.

1584
01:59:06,473 --> 01:59:08,475
I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names.

1585
01:59:53,728 --> 01:59:55,230
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1586
01:59:57,315 --> 02:00:00,235
Yet you never once used your greatest weapon.

1587
02:00:03,655 --> 02:00:04,656
A fake.

1588
02:00:12,622 --> 02:00:16,084
You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna lose it.

1589
02:00:16,251 --> 02:00:17,419
Stark.

1590
02:00:17,585 --> 02:00:18,670
You know me?

1591
02:00:19,295 --> 02:00:20,422
I do.

1592
02:00:20,964 --> 02:00:24,092
You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.

1593
02:00:25,009 --> 02:00:26,344
My only curse is you.

1594
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:29,931
Come on!

1595
02:00:57,876 --> 02:00:59,836
All that for a drop of blood.

1596
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:45,673
You have my respect, stark.

1597
02:01:47,342 --> 02:01:50,553
When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive.

1598
02:01:56,059 --> 02:01:58,144
I hope they remember you.

1599
02:02:07,946 --> 02:02:09,072
Dr. Strange: Stop.

1600
02:02:15,370 --> 02:02:16,371
Spare his life...

1601
02:02:18,164 --> 02:02:19,916
And I will give you the stone.

1602
02:02:23,461 --> 02:02:24,754
No tricks.

1603
02:03:21,978 --> 02:03:23,688
One to go.

1604
02:03:33,573 --> 02:03:34,991
Where is he?

1605
02:03:43,958 --> 02:03:45,335
Did we just lose?

1606
02:03:49,255 --> 02:03:51,174
Why would you do that?

1607
02:03:54,510 --> 02:03:56,763
We're in the endgame now.

1608
02:04:21,537 --> 02:04:24,165
Are you okay?

1609
02:04:26,125 --> 02:04:27,835
What? What is it?

1610
02:04:30,004 --> 02:04:31,130
He's here.

1611
02:04:42,141 --> 02:04:45,186
Everyone, on my position. We have incoming.

1612
02:04:47,939 --> 02:04:49,899
What the hell?

1613
02:05:15,425 --> 02:05:16,426
Banner: Cap.

1614
02:05:17,176 --> 02:05:18,636
That's him.

1615
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:23,266
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1616
02:05:47,749 --> 02:05:48,750
Wanda.

1617
02:05:49,876 --> 02:05:51,169
It's time.

1618
02:05:52,503 --> 02:05:54,714
They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can.

1619
02:05:54,881 --> 02:05:56,299
Look at me.

1620
02:05:56,466 --> 02:05:58,026
You have the power to destroy the stone.

1621
02:05:58,801 --> 02:06:00,001
You must do it. Wanda, please.

1622
02:06:01,929 --> 02:06:04,515
We are out of time.

1623
02:06:05,308 --> 02:06:06,434
I can't.

1624
02:06:06,601 --> 02:06:08,019
Yes, you can.

1625
02:06:08,686 --> 02:06:09,937
You can.

1626
02:06:11,439 --> 02:06:13,733
If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.

1627
02:06:16,110 --> 02:06:17,612
It's not fair.

1628
02:06:18,821 --> 02:06:20,406
It shouldn't be you, but it is.

1629
02:06:22,366 --> 02:06:23,826
It's all right.

1630
02:06:25,244 --> 02:06:26,954
You could never hurt me.

1631
02:06:36,005 --> 02:06:37,799
I just feel you.

1632
02:08:00,923 --> 02:08:02,049
It's all right.

1633
02:08:11,976 --> 02:08:13,311
It's all right.

1634
02:08:17,648 --> 02:08:18,733
I love you.

1635
02:08:48,054 --> 02:08:50,181
I understand, my child.

1636
02:08:51,724 --> 02:08:53,351
Better than anyone.

1637
02:08:55,019 --> 02:08:56,938
You could never.

1638
02:09:01,776 --> 02:09:04,779
Today, I lost more than you can know.

1639
02:09:06,572 --> 02:09:09,200
But now is no time to mourn.

1640
02:09:11,452 --> 02:09:15,456
Now is no time at all.

1641
02:10:37,747 --> 02:10:39,206
I told you...

1642
02:10:40,624 --> 02:10:42,418
You'd die for that.

1643
02:10:56,766 --> 02:10:58,517
You should have...

1644
02:11:01,145 --> 02:11:02,605
You should...

1645
02:11:05,107 --> 02:11:08,361
You should have gone for the head.

1646
02:11:44,688 --> 02:11:45,898
Daughter?

1647
02:11:53,531 --> 02:11:54,907
Did you do it?

1648
02:11:56,826 --> 02:11:57,827
Yes.

1649
02:12:06,252 --> 02:12:07,837
What did it cost?

1650
02:12:11,549 --> 02:12:13,050
Everything.

1651
02:12:23,310 --> 02:12:24,854
What did you do?

1652
02:12:26,105 --> 02:12:27,606
What'd you do?

1653
02:12:41,245 --> 02:12:42,621
Where'd he go?

1654
02:12:45,541 --> 02:12:46,542
Thor.

1655
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:51,547
Where'd he go?

1656
02:12:51,714 --> 02:12:52,965
Bucky: Steve?

1657
02:13:27,791 --> 02:13:30,085
Up, general. Up!

1658
02:13:30,669 --> 02:13:32,087
This is no place to die.

1659
02:13:47,144 --> 02:13:48,729
I am groot.

1660
02:13:48,812 --> 02:13:50,412
Rocket: Oh...

1661
02:13:51,232 --> 02:13:53,317
No, no, no!

1662
02:13:54,151 --> 02:13:56,987
Groot! No.

1663
02:14:15,631 --> 02:14:17,258
Sam, where you at?

1664
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:28,811
Something's happening.

1665
02:14:40,948 --> 02:14:42,116
Quill?

1666
02:14:49,498 --> 02:14:50,666
Steady, quill.

1667
02:14:50,833 --> 02:14:51,959
Oh, man.

1668
02:14:56,130 --> 02:14:57,131
Dr. Strange: Tony.

1669
02:15:00,676 --> 02:15:03,137
There was no other way.

1670
02:15:08,809 --> 02:15:09,810
Spider-man: Mr. Stark?

1671
02:15:14,273 --> 02:15:15,608
I don't feel so good.

1672
02:15:17,693 --> 02:15:18,694
You're all right.

1673
02:15:18,777 --> 02:15:19,921
I don't... I don't know what's happening.

1674
02:15:19,945 --> 02:15:21,488
I don't know...

1675
02:15:23,240 --> 02:15:24,325
I don't want to go.

1676
02:15:24,408 --> 02:15:26,118
I don't want to go, sir. Please.

1677
02:15:26,285 --> 02:15:28,996
Please, I don't want to go. I don't want to go.

1678
02:15:33,542 --> 02:15:35,044
I'm sorry.

1679
02:15:49,892 --> 02:15:51,352
He did it.

1680
02:16:16,126 --> 02:16:19,338
What is this? What the hell is happening?

1681
02:16:36,230 --> 02:16:37,981
Oh, god.

1682
02:27:34,262 --> 02:27:35,597
Fury: Still no word from stark?

1683
02:27:35,764 --> 02:27:37,015
Hill: No, not yet.

1684
02:27:37,182 --> 02:27:38,475
We 're watching every satellite

1685
02:27:38,558 --> 02:27:40,435
on both hemispheres, but still nothing.

1686
02:27:40,518 --> 02:27:42,479
Fury: What is it?

1687
02:27:42,645 --> 02:27:44,981
Hill: Multiple bogeys over wakanda.

1688
02:27:45,148 --> 02:27:47,067
Fury: Same energy signature as New York?

1689
02:27:47,233 --> 02:27:48,568
Hill: Ten times bigger.

1690
02:27:50,070 --> 02:27:51,255
Fury: Tell klein we'll meet him at...

1691
02:27:51,279 --> 02:27:52,381
Hill: Nicki Nicki

1692
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:07,253
Fury: They okay?

1693
02:28:08,254 --> 02:28:10,006
There's no one here.

1694
02:28:19,557 --> 02:28:21,059
Call control.

1695
02:28:21,810 --> 02:28:23,103
Code red.

1696
02:28:23,770 --> 02:28:24,771
Nick.

1697
02:28:26,439 --> 02:28:27,440
Fury: Hill.

1698
02:28:42,372 --> 02:28:43,540
Oh, no.

1699
02:28:45,166 --> 02:28:46,167
Mother...
