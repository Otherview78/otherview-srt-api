1
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:18,426
Spain, 1944

2
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:21,081
The Civil War is over.

3
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:23,132
Hidden in the mountains,

4
00:01:23,153 --> 00:01:25,335
armed men are still fighting
the new Fascist regime.

5
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:27,700
Military posts are established
to exterminate the Resistance.

6
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:54,495
A long time ago,

7
00:01:56,734 --> 00:02:01,535
in the Underground Realm,
where there are no lies or pain,

8
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:06,599
there lived a princess who dreamt
of the human world.

9
00:02:08,613 --> 00:02:13,812
She dreamt of blue skies,
soft breeze and sunshine.

10
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:20,118
One day,

11
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:24,488
eluding her keepers,
the princess escaped.

12
00:02:29,368 --> 00:02:32,394
Once outside...

13
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:36,500
the bright sun blinded her
and erased her memory.

14
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:42,642
She forgot who she was
and where she came from.

15
00:02:43,116 --> 00:02:49,351
Her body suffered cold, sickness and pain.
And eventually she died.

16
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,920
However, her father, the king,

17
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:56,251
always knew that the Princess' soul
would return,

18
00:02:56,763 --> 00:02:58,230
perhaps in another body,

19
00:02:58,898 --> 00:03:01,423
in another place, at another time.

20
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:05,360
He would wait for her,
until he drew his last breath,

21
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:09,002
until the world stopped turning.

22
00:03:17,883 --> 00:03:20,374
Why did you bring
so many books, Ofelia?

23
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:23,146
We're going to the country,
the outdoors.

24
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,321
Fairy tales?

25
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,826
You're a bit too old to be filling your head
with such nonsense.

26
00:03:37,904 --> 00:03:39,804
Ask him to stop the car.

27
00:03:53,953 --> 00:03:56,786
Ofelia, wait.

28
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:59,082
Your brother's not well.

29
00:04:02,262 --> 00:04:03,854
Madam, are you okay?

30
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:11,666
Ofelia?

31
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:16,968
Ofelia, Come here.

32
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:23,406
- I saw a fairy.
- Just look at your shoes!

33
00:05:24,646 --> 00:05:25,635
Let's go.

34
00:05:26,781 --> 00:05:29,682
When we get to the mill,
come out to greet the Captain.

35
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,751
I want you to call him Father.

36
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:34,621
You have no idea
how good he's been to us.

37
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:39,324
It's just a word, Ofelia...
just a word...

38
00:06:05,254 --> 00:06:06,983
They're coming, Captain.

39
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,480
15 minutes late.

40
00:06:27,443 --> 00:06:28,603
Carmen.

41
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:37,384
Welcome.

42
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:44,625
That's not necessary.
I can walk perfectly well.

43
00:06:45,096 --> 00:06:47,564
Doctor Ferreiro prefers
that you don't exert yourself.

44
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:49,127
No.

45
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:54,170
Come.
Do it for me.

46
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:00,433
Thank you.

47
00:07:02,346 --> 00:07:03,472
Ofelia, come out.

48
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,576
Say hello to the Captain.

49
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:11,679
Ofelia.

50
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:22,024
It's the other hand, Ofelia.

51
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:26,994
Mercedes!

52
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:31,104
- Bring the luggage.
- Sir.

53
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,366
It's a labyrinth.

54
00:08:41,913 --> 00:08:44,438
Just a pile of old rocks
that have always been here.

55
00:08:45,183 --> 00:08:46,741
Even before the mill.

56
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:50,754
Better not to go in there.
You may get lost.

57
00:08:51,391 --> 00:08:52,585
Thank you.

58
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:54,457
Have you read them all?

59
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,892
Mercedes!

60
00:08:57,997 --> 00:08:58,986
The Captain is calling.

61
00:09:01,534 --> 00:09:02,660
Your father needs me.

62
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:06,731
He's not my father.

63
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:09,164
The Captain is not my father.

64
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:12,675
My father was a tailor.
He died in the war.

65
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:14,144
He's not my father.

66
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:17,983
You've made that clear enough.
Shall we go?

67
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:20,480
Have you seen my mother?

68
00:09:20,954 --> 00:09:22,546
- Isn't she beautiful!
- Yes.

69
00:09:22,991 --> 00:09:25,357
She's sick with baby.
Did you notice?

70
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,007
The guerrillas are sticking
to the woods

71
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:47,109
because it's hard
to track them up there.

72
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:50,578
Those bastards know the terrain
better than any of us.

73
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:52,412
We'll block all access
to the woods

74
00:09:53,787 --> 00:09:56,847
Food, medicine-
we'll store it all. Right here.

75
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:59,926
We need to force them down,
make them come to us.

76
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,989
We'll set up three
new command posts.

77
00:10:02,162 --> 00:10:05,757
Here, here and here.

78
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:06,958
Mercedes.

79
00:10:08,235 --> 00:10:10,760
- Ask Dr. Ferreiro to come down.
- Yes, sir.

80
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:17,569
This will help you sleep
through the night.

81
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,371
Just two drops just before bed.

82
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,712
Two drops only.

83
00:10:28,256 --> 00:10:29,086
Very good.

84
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:33,254
All of it.
Good.

85
00:10:35,762 --> 00:10:39,220
Don't hesitate to call me
if you need anything. Day or night.

86
00:10:41,635 --> 00:10:43,865
You or your nurse.

87
00:10:44,672 --> 00:10:45,661
Good night.

88
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,207
Close the door
and turn off the lights, sweetie.

89
00:11:01,656 --> 00:11:03,351
You have to help us.
Come up and see him.

90
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:06,823
The wound is getting worse.
His leg isn't any better.

91
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,765
This is all I could get.

92
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:13,990
I'm sorry.

93
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:17,896
Captain Vidal is waiting
for you in his office.

94
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:45,399
Come here, Ofelia.

95
00:11:57,613 --> 00:12:00,844
Jesus, your feet.
They're frozen!

96
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:11,852
Are you afraid?

97
00:12:14,064 --> 00:12:15,088
A little.

98
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:21,295
What's that noise?

99
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:24,497
Nothing, just the wind.

100
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:29,172
Nights here are different
from city nights.

101
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:33,138
There, you hear cars-tramway.

102
00:12:33,683 --> 00:12:35,548
Here the houses are old.

103
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,309
They creak.

104
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,255
As if they were speaking.

105
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:48,730
Tomorrow, I'm going
to give you a surprise.

106
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:51,091
- A surprise?
- Yes.

107
00:12:52,637 --> 00:12:57,074
- A book?
- No, something much better.

108
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:05,014
Why did you have to get married?

109
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:11,583
I was alone too long.

110
00:13:12,188 --> 00:13:15,316
I'm with you.
You weren't alone.

111
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:17,851
You were never alone.

112
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:24,061
When you're older, you'll understand.
It hasn't been easy for me either.

113
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:29,639
Your brother's at it again-

114
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:32,635
Tell him one of your stories.

115
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:34,872
I'm sure that'll calm down.

116
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:41,341
My brother, my brother...

117
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:48,959
Many, many years ago,

118
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,694
in a sad, faraway land,

119
00:13:51,796 --> 00:13:55,527
there was an enormous mountain
made of rough, black stone.

120
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:57,862
At sunset,

121
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,801
on top of that mountain,

122
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,476
a magic rose blossomed every night
that made whoever plucked it immortal.

123
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:09,247
But no one dared go near it

124
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:12,878
because its thorns were full of poison.

125
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:26,688
Men talked amongst themselves
about their fear of death,

126
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:31,394
and pain, but never about the promise
of eternal life.

127
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:43,312
And every day, the rose wilted
unable to bequeath its gift to anyone.

128
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:49,779
Forgotten and lost at the top
of that cold, dark mountain,

129
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:53,517
forever alone, until the end of time.

130
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:07,371
Come in.

131
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:12,674
- How is she?
- Very weak.

132
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,644
She'll have as much rest
as as she needs.

133
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:15,938
I'll sleep down here.

134
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:22,609
- And my son?
- Pardon?

135
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,753
Excuse us, Captain.

136
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,851
My son, how is he?

137
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,530
For the moment, there's no
reason to be alarmed.

138
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:34,631
Very good.

139
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:41,529
Captain, your wife should not have
traveled at such a late stage of pregnancy.

140
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:48,477
- Is that your opinion?
- My professional opinion, yes, sir.

141
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:54,086
A son should be born
wherever his father is.

142
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:55,612
That's all.

143
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,558
One more thing, Captain.

144
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:02,586
What makes you so sure
the baby is a male?

145
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:05,865
Don't fuck with me.

146
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:10,330
At 8 o'clock we detected movement
in the northwestern sector.

147
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:11,833
Gunfire.

148
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:18,136
Sergeant Bayona searched the area
and captured a suspect.

149
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,843
The other one's his son,
here from the town.

150
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:23,314
Captain, my father
is an honest man.

151
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:26,442
Let me judge that.
Take your hat off in front of me.

152
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:30,116
We found this weapon on him.
It's been fired.

153
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,019
My father was hunting
rabbits, Captain.

154
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:33,650
Again, keep quiet.

155
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:46,000
"No God, no country, no Master"?

156
00:16:46,474 --> 00:16:50,604
- Just like that-how do you like that?
- Red prpaganda, Captain.

157
00:16:50,746 --> 00:16:52,543
It's not propaganda, sir.

158
00:16:53,248 --> 00:16:55,546
It's an old almanac, Captain.

159
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:58,245
We're just farmers.

160
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:00,685
Go on.

161
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:05,689
I went up into the woods, Captain.
To hunt for rabbits.

162
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:08,455
For my daughters. They're sick.

163
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:11,533
Rabbits, uh?

164
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:15,734
Captain, if my father says so,
he was hunting rabbits.

165
00:17:27,116 --> 00:17:28,811
Leave him alone.

166
00:17:31,754 --> 00:17:35,019
You killed him,
You killed him!

167
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:38,515
Murderer!
Son of a bitch!

168
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,451
Maybe you'll learn to search
these assholes properly

169
00:18:10,727 --> 00:18:12,285
before you come bothering me.

170
00:18:12,562 --> 00:18:13,722
Yes, Captain.

171
00:18:33,984 --> 00:18:37,420
Mother.
Mother, wake up!

172
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,185
Mother, there's something in the room.

173
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,532
Hello.

174
00:19:24,403 --> 00:19:25,927
Did you follow me here?

175
00:19:26,704 --> 00:19:27,864
Are you a fairy?

176
00:19:30,341 --> 00:19:31,205
Look!

177
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:38,038
This is a fairy.

178
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:07,505
You want me to go with you?

179
00:20:09,114 --> 00:20:11,548
Outside? Where?

180
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:31,224
Hello?

181
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,124
Hello?

182
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,279
Echo.

183
00:22:01,294 --> 00:22:03,319
Echo.

184
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,293
Hello?

185
00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:12,663
Hello?

186
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:16,572
It's you.

187
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:25,048
It's you.
You've returned.

188
00:22:25,153 --> 00:22:27,178
Don't be frightened,
I beg you.

189
00:22:28,522 --> 00:22:30,456
Look, look.

190
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:41,362
My name is Ofelia.
Who are you?

191
00:22:41,502 --> 00:22:42,662
Me?

192
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,708
I've had so many names...

193
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:55,907
Old names that only the wind
and the trees can pronounce.

194
00:22:56,084 --> 00:23:02,922
I am the mountain,
the forest and the earth.

195
00:23:03,725 --> 00:23:05,022
I am...

196
00:23:08,496 --> 00:23:11,294
I am a faun.

197
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:16,094
Your most humble servant,
Your Highness.

198
00:23:16,238 --> 00:23:19,867
- No, I'm...
- You're Princess Moanna,

199
00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:25,641
daughter of the king
of the underworld.

200
00:23:25,714 --> 00:23:27,443
My father was a tailor.

201
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:29,676
You are not born of man.

202
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,154
It was the moon that bore you.

203
00:23:33,323 --> 00:23:35,621
Look on your left shoulder

204
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,759
and you will find a mark
that proves it.

205
00:23:39,195 --> 00:23:49,161
Your real father had us open portals
all over the world to allow your return.

206
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:51,300
This is...

207
00:23:51,941 --> 00:23:54,535
This is the last of them.

208
00:23:55,177 --> 00:24:03,778
But we have to make sure
that your essence is intact,

209
00:24:04,288 --> 00:24:08,418
that you have not become a mortal.

210
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:17,627
You must complete three tasks
before the moon is full.

211
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:26,600
This is The Book of Crossroads.

212
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,438
Open it, when you are alone

213
00:24:30,581 --> 00:24:33,482
and it will show you your future,

214
00:24:33,584 --> 00:24:37,918
show you what must be done.

215
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:47,856
But there's nothing in here.

216
00:25:44,823 --> 00:25:48,384
Mercedes, prepare these rabbits
for dinner tonight.

217
00:25:49,393 --> 00:25:51,418
They are too young.

218
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,990
- Well, maybe they'll do for a stew.
- Yes, sir.

219
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,462
This coffee was burnt.
Taste it yourself.

220
00:26:08,914 --> 00:26:11,747
You should keep an eye on it.

221
00:26:13,553 --> 00:26:14,986
As you wish, sir.

222
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:22,516
Cook these.

223
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:26,764
- He didn't like the coffee.
- He's nothing but a fussy dandy.

224
00:26:26,898 --> 00:26:27,799
A fussy dandy!

225
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:30,101
We're going to need some beef
and one more chicken.

226
00:26:30,102 --> 00:26:33,936
- Where are we supposed to find that?
- The doctor's wife, the mayor's too.

227
00:26:34,006 --> 00:26:36,998
Well, they eat more
than a couple of pigs.

228
00:26:38,111 --> 00:26:41,672
- And they don't shut up.
- Not even underwater.

229
00:26:56,629 --> 00:26:58,654
I'll be back in a moment,
Mercedes.

230
00:27:03,771 --> 00:27:05,033
Ofelia.

231
00:27:07,608 --> 00:27:10,338
Your father is giving
a dinner party tonight.

232
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:13,578
Look what I've made for you.

233
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:16,209
Do you like it?

234
00:27:18,018 --> 00:27:21,010
What I wouldn't have given
to have such a dress...

235
00:27:21,154 --> 00:27:23,588
as fine as this when I was your age!

236
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:24,884
And look at the shoes!

237
00:27:26,261 --> 00:27:28,957
- Do you like them?
- Yes, very pretty.

238
00:27:30,597 --> 00:27:32,258
Go on, now.
Take your bath.

239
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:37,621
Ofelia?

240
00:28:39,401 --> 00:28:40,265
Ofelia?

241
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:45,161
Hurry up.
I want to see the dress on you.

242
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:48,001
I want you to be beautiful
for the Captain.

243
00:28:50,848 --> 00:28:52,611
You'll look like a princess.

244
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,419
A princess?

245
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,489
Make sure those chickens
are cleaned properly.

246
00:29:06,595 --> 00:29:09,063
And don't forget the beans.

247
00:29:12,302 --> 00:29:16,671
- You look marvelous, my girl, just beautiful.
- What a gorgeous dress!

248
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:21,600
Get back to work,
stop wasting time.

249
00:29:24,414 --> 00:29:25,881
Do you want some milk with honey?

250
00:29:31,421 --> 00:29:35,380
Move back, we can't have you getting
milk on your dress, with you looking so pretty.

251
00:29:37,761 --> 00:29:41,697
Mercedes.
Do you believe in fairies?

252
00:29:42,831 --> 00:29:43,729
No.

253
00:29:44,534 --> 00:29:45,899
But when I was a little girl,
I did.

254
00:29:45,968 --> 00:29:48,562
I believed in a lot of things
I don't believe any more.

255
00:29:50,974 --> 00:29:52,703
Last night,
a fairy visited me.

256
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,768
Really?

257
00:29:56,012 --> 00:29:59,149
And it wasn't alone,
there were lots of them,

258
00:29:59,149 --> 00:30:00,844
- And a faun, too.
- A faun?

259
00:30:01,117 --> 00:30:05,076
He was very old, very tall
and smelled like earth.

260
00:30:06,123 --> 00:30:09,149
My mother warned me
to be wary of fauns.

261
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:10,450
Mercedes!

262
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:13,363
Come with me.

263
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:25,839
Captain,
everything is here.

264
00:30:26,078 --> 00:30:28,774
Flour, salt, oil, medicine,

265
00:30:28,946 --> 00:30:32,074
olives, bacon.

266
00:30:33,184 --> 00:30:35,049
This-this is real tobacco.

267
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,419
And the ration cards.

268
00:30:37,789 --> 00:30:40,121
- I need you to check the inventory.
- Very well.

269
00:30:43,595 --> 00:30:44,619
Mercedes.

270
00:30:45,831 --> 00:30:47,526
- The key.
- Yes, sir.

271
00:30:54,872 --> 00:30:56,806
- Is this the only copy?
- The only one.

272
00:30:56,908 --> 00:30:58,705
From now on, I'll carry it.

273
00:30:59,643 --> 00:31:00,575
Captain.

274
00:31:06,351 --> 00:31:07,943
Captain,
perhaps it's nothing.

275
00:31:16,361 --> 00:31:17,350
It's them.

276
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:33,102
"Once upon a time,
when the forest was young,

277
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:39,311
they were home to creatures
who were full of magic and wonder."

278
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:48,457
"They protected one another,

279
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:51,924
and slept in the shade
of a colossal fig tree

280
00:31:52,365 --> 00:31:54,799
that grew on a hill, near the mill."

281
00:31:57,336 --> 00:31:59,099
"But now, the tree is dying.

282
00:31:59,438 --> 00:32:03,101
Its branches are dry,
its trunk old and twisted.

283
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:07,141
A monstrous toad
has settled in its roots

284
00:32:07,413 --> 00:32:08,880
and won't let the tree thrive.

285
00:32:10,185 --> 00:32:13,382
You must put the three magic
stones in the toad's mouth

286
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:17,511
and retrieve the golden key
from inside his belly.

287
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:21,288
Only then will the fig tree
flourish again."

288
00:33:47,816 --> 00:33:49,613
They were here
less than twenty minutes ago.

289
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:52,250
They left in a hurry.

290
00:33:59,395 --> 00:34:01,295
A dozen men, at most.

291
00:34:20,215 --> 00:34:21,580
Antibiotics.

292
00:34:22,551 --> 00:34:25,714
Shit, they forgot this lottery ticket.

293
00:34:28,057 --> 00:34:29,251
They're here.

294
00:34:32,227 --> 00:34:34,593
Those sons of bitches are here.

295
00:34:35,463 --> 00:34:37,590
And they're watching us.

296
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,238
Hey!

297
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,071
You left this behind!

298
00:34:53,816 --> 00:34:55,807
And your lottery ticket!

299
00:34:56,352 --> 00:34:58,445
Why don't you come back
and get it?

300
00:34:59,188 --> 00:35:01,656
Who knows?
This could be your lucky day!

301
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:16,358
Hello.
I'm Princess Moanna,

302
00:36:16,734 --> 00:36:18,201
and I'm not afraid of you.

303
00:36:21,672 --> 00:36:24,903
Aren't you ashamed
living down here,

304
00:36:25,108 --> 00:36:27,133
eating all these bugs...

305
00:36:27,911 --> 00:36:30,846
and growing fat
while the tree dies?

306
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:15,773
Have you looked in her room?
And the pantry?

307
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:17,179
Yes, ma'am.

308
00:39:20,788 --> 00:39:22,380
Have you checked the garden?

309
00:39:22,724 --> 00:39:24,521
- And the barn?
- Yes, ma'am.

310
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:26,953
Where is that girl?

311
00:39:27,028 --> 00:39:28,325
This way, please.

312
00:39:29,363 --> 00:39:32,355
Let me to introduce you
to my wife, Carmen.

313
00:39:34,235 --> 00:39:36,100
- Charmed.
- A pleasure to meet you.

314
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:40,003
From now on,
one ration card per family.

315
00:39:40,775 --> 00:39:41,742
Take a look.

316
00:39:41,876 --> 00:39:44,071
- One?
- Only one.

317
00:39:44,846 --> 00:39:46,643
Captain, I'm not sure
it'll be enough.

318
00:39:46,714 --> 00:39:48,045
If people are careful,
it should be plenty.

319
00:39:48,116 --> 00:39:51,313
We can't allow anyone to send food
to the guerillas in the mountains.

320
00:39:51,452 --> 00:39:55,320
They're losing ground,
and one of them is wounded.

321
00:39:56,191 --> 00:39:58,927
Excuse me, Captain,
how can you be so sure?

322
00:39:58,927 --> 00:40:01,657
We almost got them.
We found this.

323
00:40:02,463 --> 00:40:03,691
Antibiotics.

324
00:40:04,933 --> 00:40:07,299
God has already
saved their souls.

325
00:40:07,568 --> 00:40:10,196
What happens to their bodies
hardly matter to Him.

326
00:40:10,371 --> 00:40:12,862
We'll help however we can, Captain.

327
00:40:12,974 --> 00:40:15,135
We know you're not here by choice.

328
00:40:19,515 --> 00:40:20,573
You're wrong about that.

329
00:40:21,783 --> 00:40:25,651
I choose to be here because I want
my son to be born in a new, clean Spain.

330
00:40:26,622 --> 00:40:29,716
Because these people
hold the mistaken belief

331
00:40:29,992 --> 00:40:31,550
that we're all equal.

332
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:33,628
But there's a big difference:

333
00:40:34,228 --> 00:40:36,753
The war is over and we won.

334
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:40,301
And if we need to kill every one
of these vermin to settle it,

335
00:40:41,303 --> 00:40:43,464
then we'll kill them all,
and that's that.

336
00:40:44,707 --> 00:40:46,231
We're all here by choice.

337
00:40:47,242 --> 00:40:49,437
By choice!

338
00:40:52,348 --> 00:40:55,146
Put the coffee on.
I'm going for more wood.

339
00:40:55,283 --> 00:40:57,274
We'll take care of it.

340
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,406
Ofelia?

341
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,295
So, how did you
and the Captain meet?

342
00:41:42,732 --> 00:41:45,530
Ofelia's father used to make
the Captain's uniforms.

343
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:46,636
Oh, I see...

344
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:51,368
And after he died,
I went to work at the shop.

345
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,704
A little more than a year ago,

346
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:58,412
the Captain and I met again.

347
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:00,071
Curious, isn't it!

348
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,319
I mean, finding each other again?

349
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,517
Oh, yes,
very, very curious.

350
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:11,488
Please, forgive my wife.
She hasn't been exposed to the world.

351
00:42:11,997 --> 00:42:14,227
She thinks these silly stories
are interesting to others.

352
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:16,923
We understand.

353
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:21,497
Excuse me, madam
Ofelia is here.

354
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,638
Excuse me.

355
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:36,781
Have I told you that I was acquainted
with your father, Captain?

356
00:42:37,957 --> 00:42:39,424
No.
I had no idea.

357
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,650
In Morocco.

358
00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:47,032
I knew him only briefly,
but he left a great impression.

359
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:48,292
An excellent soldier.

360
00:42:48,767 --> 00:42:53,067
The men in his battalion said that
when General Vidal died on the battlefield,

361
00:42:53,872 --> 00:42:55,533
he smashed his watch on a rock

362
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,231
so that his son would know
the exact hour and minute of his death.

363
00:42:59,345 --> 00:43:01,677
So he would know
how a brave man dies.

364
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:07,274
Nonsense.
He didn't own a watch.

365
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:12,084
What you've done hurts me.

366
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:16,219
After your bath,
you'll go to bed without supper.

367
00:43:18,232 --> 00:43:19,324
Are you listening?

368
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:25,565
Sometimes I think
you'll never learn to behave.

369
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:28,430
You've disappointed me, Ofelia.

370
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:31,909
And your father, too.

371
00:43:33,379 --> 00:43:34,641
You mean the Captain?

372
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,077
Him more than me.

373
00:43:52,532 --> 00:43:53,965
I've got the key.

374
00:43:57,703 --> 00:43:59,330
Take me to the Labyrinth.

375
00:44:52,594 --> 00:44:53,583
Hello.

376
00:44:55,396 --> 00:44:57,193
I got the key out.

377
00:44:58,266 --> 00:45:03,135
That's me,
and the girl is you.

378
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:04,664
And the baby?

379
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,270
So... you retrieved the key.

380
00:45:11,045 --> 00:45:12,307
I'm glad.

381
00:45:20,954 --> 00:45:25,254
She believed in you
from the very beginning.

382
00:45:25,627 --> 00:45:28,323
She's so glad you succeeded.

383
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:35,768
Keep the key.

384
00:45:36,204 --> 00:45:39,367
You'll be needing it very soon.

385
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:44,444
And this too?
A piece of chalk.

386
00:45:45,881 --> 00:45:49,151
Two tasks remain

387
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:53,985
and the moon is almost full.

388
00:45:54,089 --> 00:45:55,886
Be patient.

389
00:45:56,158 --> 00:46:04,862
We'll soon stroll through
the seven circular gardens of your palace.

390
00:46:04,968 --> 00:46:07,493
How do I know
that what you say is true?

391
00:46:07,803 --> 00:46:13,742
Why would a poor little faun
like me lie to you?

392
00:46:35,864 --> 00:46:37,058
Proceed.

393
00:46:38,102 --> 00:46:40,536
Have your cards
ready for inspection.

394
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:43,330
Let's go.
Your name?

395
00:46:47,077 --> 00:46:48,567
Your names, first and last.

396
00:46:49,045 --> 00:46:53,209
Narciso Pena Soriano,
at your service.

397
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:58,949
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain,

398
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:03,286
kept safe in this mill!
The Reds lie...

399
00:47:03,661 --> 00:47:05,322
because in a united Spain,

400
00:47:05,496 --> 00:47:09,193
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

401
00:47:23,414 --> 00:47:26,975
Come on, show me
what happens now?

402
00:47:27,485 --> 00:47:28,509
Show me.

403
00:48:06,558 --> 00:48:08,150
Ofelia, help me...

404
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:15,864
Captain! Captain!

405
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,995
Come quickly.

406
00:48:20,538 --> 00:48:21,835
...because in a united Spain,

407
00:48:21,939 --> 00:48:25,807
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

408
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,610
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain...

409
00:48:31,516 --> 00:48:34,485
Your wife needs
uninterrupted rest.

410
00:48:36,353 --> 00:48:39,254
She'll have to be sedated
most of the time.

411
00:48:41,492 --> 00:48:43,824
The girl should sleep
somewhere else.

412
00:48:45,597 --> 00:48:47,656
I'll stay here until the birth.

413
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,100
Make her well.

414
00:48:50,436 --> 00:48:52,461
I don't care what it costs
or what you need.

415
00:48:57,175 --> 00:48:57,869
Make her well.

416
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:20,666
Don't worry.

417
00:49:21,835 --> 00:49:24,326
Your mother will get better soon,
you'll see.

418
00:49:27,707 --> 00:49:29,334
Having a baby is complicated.

419
00:49:30,142 --> 00:49:33,305
Then I'll never have one.

420
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,691
You're helping the men
in the woods, aren't you?

421
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,671
Have you told anyone?

422
00:50:03,243 --> 00:50:04,369
No, I haven't.

423
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,673
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

424
00:50:19,594 --> 00:50:20,856
Nor I to you.

425
00:50:22,397 --> 00:50:24,524
Do you know a lullaby?

426
00:50:26,501 --> 00:50:27,729
Only one...

427
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:30,895
but I don't remember the words.

428
00:50:31,206 --> 00:50:34,801
I don't care.
I still want to hear it.

429
00:51:28,163 --> 00:51:30,927
Don't be afraid.
It's only me.

430
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:41,843
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

431
00:51:43,011 --> 00:51:44,137
Then let's go.

432
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:50,618
This is sheer madness.

433
00:51:50,985 --> 00:51:53,419
When that man finds out about us,
he'll kill us all.

434
00:51:53,922 --> 00:51:57,050
- Have you thought about that?
- Are you so afraid of him, Doctor?

435
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:59,426
It's not fear...

436
00:52:00,029 --> 00:52:01,394
at least not for myself.

437
00:52:13,175 --> 00:52:14,574
Pedro!

438
00:52:14,877 --> 00:52:17,311
Pedro, My brother!

439
00:52:33,963 --> 00:52:36,124
You didn't carry out the task.

440
00:52:36,266 --> 00:52:39,565
No, my mother is sick.

441
00:52:41,105 --> 00:52:43,699
That's no excuse
for negligence.

442
00:52:43,973 --> 00:52:48,842
Look...
this is a mandrake root.

443
00:52:48,945 --> 00:52:52,813
A plant that dreamt
of being human.

444
00:52:53,751 --> 00:52:58,415
Put it under your mother's bed

445
00:52:58,789 --> 00:53:02,020
in a bowl of fresh milk.

446
00:53:02,626 --> 00:53:07,586
Each morning,
give it two drops of blood.

447
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:12,092
Now, we have no time
to waste.

448
00:53:12,403 --> 00:53:15,167
The full moon will be upon us.

449
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:20,009
Take my pets
to guide you through.

450
00:53:20,611 --> 00:53:26,208
You're going to a very dangerous
place, so be careful.

451
00:53:26,417 --> 00:53:29,181
The thing that slumbers there,

452
00:53:30,087 --> 00:53:32,612
it is not human.

453
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:40,726
You will see
a sumptuous feast,

454
00:53:40,832 --> 00:53:43,630
but don't eat
or drink anything.

455
00:53:43,835 --> 00:53:48,568
Absolutely nothing.

456
00:53:50,242 --> 00:53:53,769
Your life depends on it.

457
00:54:14,432 --> 00:54:19,392
I've brought some Orujo,
tobacco, cheese.

458
00:54:20,105 --> 00:54:22,471
Mail for Trigo and Piloto.

459
00:54:24,545 --> 00:54:26,513
Let's see how that leg's doing,
Frenchie.

460
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:30,515
How do you think it's doing?
It's fucked up.

461
00:54:30,982 --> 00:54:32,574
Let's see.

462
00:54:35,655 --> 00:54:38,920
...N- North American,

463
00:54:40,294 --> 00:54:42,956
British and Canadian troops

464
00:54:43,061 --> 00:54:46,588
disembarked on a small beach
in the North of F-F.

465
00:54:47,434 --> 00:54:50,130
- "France", idiot.
- F-f-f-rance.

466
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,028
More than 150,000 soldiers
give us hope...

467
00:54:53,273 --> 00:54:58,074
under the command
of General Dwight D. Eisenhower...

468
00:54:58,278 --> 00:55:01,247
Is it really bad, doctor?

469
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,907
Look, Frenchie.

470
00:55:05,184 --> 00:55:06,742
There's no way to save it.

471
00:55:18,631 --> 00:55:21,930
I'll try to make it
in as few cuts as possible.

472
00:55:29,709 --> 00:55:33,110
Wait a second, doctor,
just a second.

473
00:56:08,215 --> 00:56:14,381
"Use the chalk to trace a door
anywhere in your room."

474
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:23,519
"Once the door's open,
start the hourglass."

475
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:27,960
"Let the fairies guide you."

476
00:56:33,341 --> 00:56:36,674
"Don't eat or drink anything,
during your stay,

477
00:56:36,912 --> 00:56:41,474
and come back
before the last grain of sand falls."

478
00:58:50,447 --> 00:58:51,471
No...

479
00:58:54,317 --> 00:58:55,511
This other one.

480
01:01:31,411 --> 01:01:33,038
No! No!

481
01:02:48,855 --> 01:02:50,755
We'll soon have reinforcements
from Jaca.

482
01:02:51,191 --> 01:02:55,093
Fifty men or more.
Then we'll go head to head with Vidal.

483
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:58,621
And then what?

484
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:03,030
You kill him, they'll send another
just like him. And another...

485
01:03:03,603 --> 01:03:06,834
You're screwed, no guns,
no safe shelter...

486
01:03:06,941 --> 01:03:11,173
You need food, medicine.
You must take care of Mercedes.

487
01:03:11,411 --> 01:03:13,140
If you really love her,
you'd cross the border with her.

488
01:03:13,214 --> 01:03:15,648
- This is a lost cause.
- I'm staying here, doctor.

489
01:03:15,983 --> 01:03:16,950
There's no choice.

490
01:03:29,364 --> 01:03:30,524
You have to leave.

491
01:03:32,301 --> 01:03:35,236
Here's the key,
but you can't go down there now.

492
01:03:35,504 --> 01:03:37,734
It's exactly what he expects.

493
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:41,877
Leave it to me.

494
01:03:45,949 --> 01:03:47,075
I'm a coward.

495
01:03:48,184 --> 01:03:50,709
No, you're not.

496
01:03:51,889 --> 01:03:53,117
Yes, I am.

497
01:03:53,756 --> 01:03:58,193
A coward... for living
next to that son of a bitch,

498
01:03:59,496 --> 01:04:02,294
doing his laundry, making his bed,
feeding him.

499
01:04:06,002 --> 01:04:08,493
What if the doctor's right
and we can't win?

500
01:04:12,809 --> 01:04:15,039
At least we'll make things
harder for that bastard.

501
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:10,895
Captain Vidal...

502
01:06:12,998 --> 01:06:15,523
Her temperature's down.
I don't know how, but it is.

503
01:06:16,334 --> 01:06:17,266
But she still has a fever?

504
01:06:17,903 --> 01:06:20,804
Yes, but it's a good sign.
Her body is responding.

505
01:06:22,607 --> 01:06:23,574
Listen to me.

506
01:06:24,241 --> 01:06:27,267
If you have to choose,
save the baby.

507
01:06:27,445 --> 01:06:29,970
That boy will bear my name
and my father's name.

508
01:06:30,115 --> 01:06:31,104
Save him.

509
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,087
Brother...

510
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:11,022
Little brother...

511
01:07:13,261 --> 01:07:14,785
If you can hear me,

512
01:07:15,895 --> 01:07:18,056
things out here aren't too good.

513
01:07:19,933 --> 01:07:21,924
But soon you'll have to come out.

514
01:07:23,203 --> 01:07:24,830
You've made Mama very sick.

515
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,669
I want to ask you one favor
for when you come out,

516
01:07:31,812 --> 01:07:32,938
just one:

517
01:07:34,281 --> 01:07:35,942
Don't hurt her.

518
01:07:37,149 --> 01:07:40,380
You'll meet her,
she's very pretty,

519
01:07:41,221 --> 01:07:43,485
even though sometimes she's sad
for days at a time.

520
01:07:44,592 --> 01:07:46,457
You'll see, when she smiles,

521
01:07:48,061 --> 01:07:49,551
you'll love her.

522
01:07:51,933 --> 01:07:55,232
Listen, if you do what I say,

523
01:07:55,536 --> 01:07:57,094
I'll make you a promise,

524
01:07:58,038 --> 01:08:01,667
I'll take you to my kingdom,
and I'll make you a prince.

525
01:08:02,677 --> 01:08:05,840
I promise you, a prince.

526
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:35,033
I sounded the whistle,
but they wouldn't move.

527
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:37,644
I tried to stop, but it was too late.

528
01:08:37,712 --> 01:08:40,146
The fireman and I
jumped out just in time,

529
01:08:40,381 --> 01:08:41,780
but look at the mess they made.

530
01:08:44,952 --> 01:08:46,681
What did they steal
from the freight cars?

531
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:48,986
They didn't open a single one.

532
01:08:49,257 --> 01:08:50,690
What the hell are you talking about?

533
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:53,124
This whole mess...
They didn't open any of the cars.

534
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:57,629
- They didn't take anything.
- Nothing? Are you sure?

535
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,868
God only knows what they wanted,
other than to waste our time.

536
01:09:18,722 --> 01:09:20,485
They came out of nowhere, Captain.

537
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:26,990
They have grenades,
they went up hill.

538
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:34,498
Captain, we've surrounded
a small unit that fell behind.

539
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:36,329
They took cover up on the hill.

540
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:15,901
Go ahead, Serrano, don't be afraid,
this is the only decent way to die.

541
01:10:59,623 --> 01:11:00,817
Serrano!

542
01:11:18,042 --> 01:11:21,068
Let me see.

543
01:11:25,817 --> 01:11:26,909
Can you talk?

544
01:11:31,323 --> 01:11:32,290
Damn it!

545
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:53,469
These are useless! They can't talk.

546
01:12:02,787 --> 01:12:05,449
Captain,
this one's still alive.

547
01:12:09,528 --> 01:12:10,893
Shot in the leg.

548
01:12:16,836 --> 01:12:18,201
- What's happened?
- They caught one.

549
01:12:18,304 --> 01:12:20,670
They took one of them alive.
And they're taking him to the storeroom.

550
01:12:25,879 --> 01:12:27,005
Mercedes!

551
01:12:27,848 --> 01:12:30,078
Pedro... Pedro...

552
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:48,501
Mercedes?

553
01:12:49,436 --> 01:12:52,428
- I need to get into the storeroom.
- Not now.

554
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:54,271
Move away!

555
01:13:21,369 --> 01:13:23,599
That's plenty, dear.

556
01:13:27,175 --> 01:13:28,665
Should I take this up?

557
01:13:48,529 --> 01:13:50,997
Here, half the dose.

558
01:13:51,499 --> 01:13:53,296
I don't think I need it.

559
01:13:53,602 --> 01:13:56,594
I feel better, much better.

560
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:59,270
I don't understand.
But I'm glad.

561
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:03,201
Mother...

562
01:14:17,959 --> 01:14:20,723
Damn, this cigarette is good!

563
01:14:21,496 --> 01:14:24,897
Real tobacco hard to find.

564
01:14:26,536 --> 01:14:28,936
G-G-Go to hell.

565
01:14:31,606 --> 01:14:35,599
Damn, Garces. We catch one
and he turns out to be a stutterer.

566
01:14:35,878 --> 01:14:38,005
We'll be here all night.

567
01:14:38,213 --> 01:14:40,181
As long as he talks.

568
01:14:46,054 --> 01:14:47,885
Garces is right.

569
01:14:48,725 --> 01:14:51,023
You'd do better
to tell us everything.

570
01:14:51,727 --> 01:14:55,094
But to make sure it happens,
I brought along a few tools.

571
01:14:57,434 --> 01:14:59,629
Just things you pick up
along the way.

572
01:14:59,837 --> 01:15:02,271
At first, I won't be able to trust you,

573
01:15:02,838 --> 01:15:06,296
but after I use this,
you'll own up to a few things.

574
01:15:08,344 --> 01:15:09,811
When we get to these,

575
01:15:10,847 --> 01:15:14,510
we'll have developed...
how can I put this-?

576
01:15:14,918 --> 01:15:17,512
A closer bond,
much like brothers.

577
01:15:18,955 --> 01:15:20,479
You'll see.

578
01:15:22,491 --> 01:15:24,152
And when we get to this one,

579
01:15:25,528 --> 01:15:27,962
I'll believe anything you tell me.

580
01:15:40,277 --> 01:15:41,574
I'll make you a deal.

581
01:15:41,645 --> 01:15:45,172
If you can count to three
without st-t-tuttering,

582
01:15:45,516 --> 01:15:46,710
you can go.

583
01:15:48,886 --> 01:15:51,821
Don't look at him, look at me.

584
01:15:52,088 --> 01:15:53,851
Above me, there's no one.

585
01:15:54,391 --> 01:15:56,291
- Garces!
- Yes, Captain?

586
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,087
If I say this asshole can leave,
would anybody contradict me?

587
01:16:00,165 --> 01:16:01,792
No one, Captain.
He can leave.

588
01:16:02,534 --> 01:16:06,664
There you have it.
Count to three.

589
01:16:23,054 --> 01:16:25,682
- One.
- Good.

590
01:16:29,927 --> 01:16:30,894
Two.

591
01:16:32,664 --> 01:16:35,565
One more and you will be free.

592
01:16:52,485 --> 01:16:53,452
Shame.

593
01:17:05,364 --> 01:17:09,391
Your mother is much better,
Your Highness.

594
01:17:10,836 --> 01:17:16,900
Surely, you must be relieved.

595
01:17:17,409 --> 01:17:19,502
Yes, thank you.

596
01:17:19,911 --> 01:17:23,369
But things haven't turned out so well.

597
01:17:24,282 --> 01:17:25,374
No?

598
01:17:27,186 --> 01:17:30,815
- I had an accident.
- An accident?

599
01:17:30,988 --> 01:17:31,955
Yes.

600
01:17:41,232 --> 01:17:44,133
- You broke the rules!
- It was only two grapes!

601
01:17:44,235 --> 01:17:45,827
I thought no one would notice.

602
01:17:47,239 --> 01:17:50,333
- We've made a mistake!
- A mistake?

603
01:17:51,076 --> 01:17:54,807
You failed.
You can never return.

604
01:17:54,914 --> 01:17:58,577
- It was an accident!
- You cannot return.

605
01:17:58,684 --> 01:18:02,643
The moon will be full in three days.

606
01:18:03,222 --> 01:18:08,922
Your spirit shall forever remain
among the humans.

607
01:18:09,029 --> 01:18:12,897
You shall age like them,
you shall die like them

608
01:18:12,966 --> 01:18:17,062
and all memory of you
shall fade in time.

609
01:18:17,638 --> 01:18:21,631
And we'll vanish along with it.

610
01:18:22,274 --> 01:18:26,074
You will never see us again.

611
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:40,521
Good day, doctor.
Sorry to wake you so early,

612
01:18:41,261 --> 01:18:42,990
but I think we need your help.

613
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:07,877
My God, what have you done to him?

614
01:19:08,055 --> 01:19:09,181
Not much.

615
01:19:11,123 --> 01:19:12,920
But things are getting better.

616
01:19:20,835 --> 01:19:25,568
I like having you handy, Doctor.
It has its advantages.

617
01:19:27,108 --> 01:19:28,575
Serrano, stay here.

618
01:19:28,742 --> 01:19:29,800
I talked.

619
01:19:31,211 --> 01:19:32,439
Not much.

620
01:19:34,816 --> 01:19:38,252
- B-b-but I talked.
- I'm sorry.

621
01:19:38,986 --> 01:19:40,578
I'm so sorry.

622
01:19:47,728 --> 01:19:52,859
Kill me.
Kill me now, please.

623
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:10,642
Son of a bitch.

624
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:33,674
It'll take away the pain.

625
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:41,515
It's almost over.

626
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:51,591
Watch Dr. Ferreiro,

627
01:20:51,726 --> 01:20:53,193
- I'll be right there.
- Yes, Captain.

628
01:21:16,752 --> 01:21:18,344
You're not moving anymore.

629
01:21:19,856 --> 01:21:21,289
Are you sick?

630
01:21:24,492 --> 01:21:27,017
What are you doing down there?

631
01:21:40,611 --> 01:21:42,272
- Call him!
- Who?

632
01:21:42,378 --> 01:21:44,778
Who else, you imbecile?
Ferreiro!

633
01:22:08,872 --> 01:22:10,965
What the hell is this?

634
01:22:14,045 --> 01:22:15,637
No! No, no!

635
01:22:15,879 --> 01:22:19,474
Leave her.
Leave her alone, please!

636
01:22:21,185 --> 01:22:23,745
Look at this! Look what she
was hiding under your bed!

637
01:22:24,154 --> 01:22:25,348
What do you think of this?

638
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:34,454
Ofelia, what is this thing doing
under the bed?

639
01:22:34,666 --> 01:22:38,602
It's a magic root
the faun gave me.

640
01:22:38,769 --> 01:22:41,363
This is all because of that junk
you let her read.

641
01:22:41,706 --> 01:22:42,673
Look what you've done!

642
01:22:42,807 --> 01:22:46,868
Please, leave us alone.
I'll talk to her, darling.

643
01:22:47,511 --> 01:22:50,446
Fine.
As you wish.

644
01:22:52,249 --> 01:22:54,945
He told me you would get better.
And you did.

645
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:58,121
Ofelia, you have to listen
to your father.

646
01:22:59,457 --> 01:23:00,549
You have to stop all this.

647
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:03,854
No. I want to leave this place!

648
01:23:04,194 --> 01:23:07,357
Please, take me away from here!
Let's just go, Please!

649
01:23:07,499 --> 01:23:09,797
Things are not that simple.

650
01:23:12,036 --> 01:23:13,867
You're getting older,

651
01:23:14,906 --> 01:23:18,273
soon you'll see that life
isn't like your fairy tales.

652
01:23:18,878 --> 01:23:21,073
The world is a cruel place.

653
01:23:22,447 --> 01:23:26,178
And you'll learn that,
even if it hurts.

654
01:23:27,787 --> 01:23:30,312
- No! No!
- Ofelia!

655
01:23:31,656 --> 01:23:36,616
Magic does not exist.
Not for you, me or anyone else.

656
01:23:48,442 --> 01:23:50,706
Mom! Help!

657
01:23:51,177 --> 01:23:52,610
Help!

658
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,742
Help!

659
01:24:00,787 --> 01:24:01,754
Why did you do it?

660
01:24:04,090 --> 01:24:05,751
It was the only thing I could do.

661
01:24:07,094 --> 01:24:09,324
No. You could have obeyed me.

662
01:24:11,097 --> 01:24:13,361
I could have, but I didn't.

663
01:24:15,301 --> 01:24:17,826
It would have been better for you.
You know it.

664
01:24:19,239 --> 01:24:22,208
I don't understand.
Why didn't you obey me?

665
01:24:22,509 --> 01:24:28,641
To obey-just like that-for the sake
of obeying, without questioning...

666
01:24:30,384 --> 01:24:33,376
that's something only people
like you can do, Captain.

667
01:25:10,824 --> 01:25:12,155
Captain!

668
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:20,830
Garces! Call the troop paramedic.

669
01:25:21,034 --> 01:25:23,525
- Get up immediately!
- Yes, Captain.

670
01:25:58,172 --> 01:26:00,037
Your wife is dead.

671
01:26:09,717 --> 01:26:13,209
Because the paths to the Lord
are inscrutable.

672
01:26:13,689 --> 01:26:15,554
Because the essence
of His forgiveness

673
01:26:15,624 --> 01:26:18,957
lies in His word
and in His mystery.

674
01:26:19,828 --> 01:26:22,820
Because although God
sends us the message,

675
01:26:22,965 --> 01:26:25,593
it is our task to decipher it.

676
01:26:26,468 --> 01:26:28,299
Because when we open our arms

677
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:33,339
the earth takes in only a hollow
and senseless shell.

678
01:26:34,710 --> 01:26:37,645
Far away now is the soul
in its eternal glory.

679
01:26:38,248 --> 01:26:41,911
Because it is in pain
that we find the meaning of life.

680
01:26:42,718 --> 01:26:45,653
And the state of grace
that we lose when we are born.

681
01:26:46,990 --> 01:26:52,257
Because God, in His infinite wisdom,
puts the solution in our hands.

682
01:26:56,332 --> 01:26:58,823
And because it is only
in His physical absence,

683
01:26:59,001 --> 01:27:03,267
that the place He occupies
in our souls is reaffirmed.

684
01:27:25,228 --> 01:27:28,720
You knew
Dr. Ferreiro pretty well,
didn't you, Mercedes?

685
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:32,735
We all knew him, sir.
Everyone around here.

686
01:27:34,704 --> 01:27:38,333
The stutterer spoke of an informer.
Here... at the mill.

687
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:43,378
Can you imagine?
Right under my nose.

688
01:27:45,216 --> 01:27:48,652
Mercedes, please.

689
01:27:58,395 --> 01:27:59,828
What must you think of me?

690
01:28:01,099 --> 01:28:02,691
You must think that
I'm a monster.

691
01:28:03,235 --> 01:28:06,136
It doesn't matter
what someone like me thinks, sir.

692
01:28:16,314 --> 01:28:19,215
I want you to the storehouse
and bring me some more liquor, please.

693
01:28:19,484 --> 01:28:22,681
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, sir.

694
01:28:23,254 --> 01:28:27,213
Mercedes,
aren't you forgetting something?

695
01:28:28,259 --> 01:28:29,248
Sir?

696
01:28:34,299 --> 01:28:35,197
The key.

697
01:28:36,234 --> 01:28:38,566
I do have the only copy, don't I?

698
01:28:39,770 --> 01:28:40,759
Yes, sir.

699
01:28:42,306 --> 01:28:46,299
You know, there's an odd detail
that's been bothering me.

700
01:28:46,645 --> 01:28:48,579
Maybe it's not important, but...

701
01:28:48,846 --> 01:28:50,438
the day they broke into
the storehouse,

702
01:28:50,681 --> 01:28:53,013
with all those grenades
and explosives,

703
01:28:53,919 --> 01:28:55,409
the lock itself wasn't forced.

704
01:28:57,722 --> 01:29:01,317
As I said, it's probably
not important.

705
01:29:04,929 --> 01:29:06,226
Be very careful.

706
01:29:08,334 --> 01:29:09,562
Good night, sir.

707
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:55,174
Ofelia, Ofelia!

708
01:29:55,448 --> 01:29:57,473
Ofelia, I'm leaving tonight.

709
01:29:58,017 --> 01:30:01,509
- Where to?
- I can't tell you. I can't tell you...

710
01:30:01,621 --> 01:30:04,647
- Take me with you.
- No, no. I can't.

711
01:30:04,757 --> 01:30:07,783
I can't, my child. But I'll come
back for you, I promise.

712
01:30:07,928 --> 01:30:09,054
Take me with you.

713
01:30:33,955 --> 01:30:35,252
I heard something.

714
01:30:40,228 --> 01:30:43,391
It's nothing, don't worry.

715
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:53,728
Mercedes.

716
01:30:55,909 --> 01:30:56,876
Ofelia.

717
01:31:05,887 --> 01:31:07,514
How long have
you known about her?

718
01:31:12,928 --> 01:31:14,486
How long have you been
laughing at me?

719
01:31:14,730 --> 01:31:15,924
Little bitch!

720
01:31:17,265 --> 01:31:18,527
Watch her!

721
01:31:22,004 --> 01:31:23,733
And if anyone tries to get in,

722
01:31:24,705 --> 01:31:26,297
kill her first.

723
01:31:40,623 --> 01:31:41,590
Dry meat.

724
01:31:45,194 --> 01:31:46,183
Tobacco.

725
01:31:47,497 --> 01:31:50,261
If you had asked for it, I would have
given this to you, Mercedes.

726
01:31:57,474 --> 01:31:59,704
I want the names of whoever
wrote these letters.

727
01:32:01,442 --> 01:32:03,603
And I want them
in front of me, tomorrow.

728
01:32:03,978 --> 01:32:05,002
Yes, Captain.

729
01:32:07,883 --> 01:32:09,350
You can go, Garces.

730
01:32:10,918 --> 01:32:12,317
You're sure, Captain?

731
01:32:14,756 --> 01:32:17,520
For God's sake,
she's just a woman.

732
01:32:21,497 --> 01:32:23,658
That's what you've always thought.

733
01:32:24,833 --> 01:32:27,631
That's why I was able to get away with it.

734
01:32:27,871 --> 01:32:32,535
- I was invisible to you.
- Damn.

735
01:32:33,375 --> 01:32:37,175
You've found my weakness:
Pride.

736
01:32:38,581 --> 01:32:41,914
But it's your weak points
we're interested in.

737
01:32:44,287 --> 01:32:47,222
It's very simple: You will talk...

738
01:32:48,925 --> 01:32:49,949
And I have to know

739
01:32:51,927 --> 01:32:53,224
that everything you say is the truth.

740
01:32:54,464 --> 01:32:58,730
We have a few things here
strictly for that purpose.

741
01:33:00,671 --> 01:33:01,933
Nothing complicated.

742
01:33:04,773 --> 01:33:06,297
Things we learn on the job.

743
01:33:08,411 --> 01:33:10,379
At first...

744
01:33:27,498 --> 01:33:30,729
I'm not some old man!
Not a wounded prisoner!

745
01:33:30,801 --> 01:33:34,862
Mother Fucker!
Don't you dare touch the girl?

746
01:33:35,105 --> 01:33:36,868
Won't be the first pig I gutted.

747
01:34:00,365 --> 01:34:01,457
Look! He let her go.

748
01:34:03,969 --> 01:34:05,266
The fuck did you say?

749
01:34:13,278 --> 01:34:15,974
Get her!
Come on! Bring her to me!

750
01:34:16,414 --> 01:34:18,245
Bring her to me, damn it!

751
01:34:18,382 --> 01:34:19,872
Mount up!

752
01:35:22,815 --> 01:35:25,306
It'll be better if you come
with me without struggling.

753
01:35:25,951 --> 01:35:27,976
The Captain said that if you behave...

754
01:35:32,626 --> 01:35:34,389
Don't be a fool, sweetheart.

755
01:35:34,761 --> 01:35:36,319
If anyone's going to kill you...

756
01:35:38,432 --> 01:35:39,626
I'd rather it be me.

757
01:36:50,179 --> 01:36:55,116
I've decided to give you
one last chance.

758
01:37:00,389 --> 01:37:02,084
Do you promise to do what I say?

759
01:37:04,094 --> 01:37:08,326
Will you do everything I tell you,
without question?

760
01:37:10,133 --> 01:37:13,102
This is your last chance.

761
01:37:14,238 --> 01:37:17,366
Then listen to me.

762
01:37:17,807 --> 01:37:20,207
Fetch your brother

763
01:37:20,610 --> 01:37:23,272
and bring him to the labyrinth,

764
01:37:23,413 --> 01:37:27,816
as quickly as you can,
Your Highness.

765
01:37:28,051 --> 01:37:29,382
My brother?

766
01:37:29,619 --> 01:37:30,950
We need him.

767
01:37:31,088 --> 01:37:34,148
- But...
- No more questions.

768
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:38,718
The door's locked.

769
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:45,634
In that case,
create your own door.

770
01:40:34,276 --> 01:40:35,709
Captain, with your permission.

771
01:40:39,078 --> 01:40:40,102
Come quickly.

772
01:40:40,881 --> 01:40:44,146
- Now what?
- Serrano is back. He's wounded.

773
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:46,484
Wounded?

774
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:34,099
Where's Garces?

775
01:41:41,577 --> 01:41:42,566
How many were there?

776
01:41:43,110 --> 01:41:45,340
I don't know exactly, Captain.

777
01:41:45,779 --> 01:41:47,269
Fifty men, at least.

778
01:41:47,382 --> 01:41:50,977
The rest of the men didn't make it.
Our watch posts are not responding.

779
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:54,714
- How many men we have left?
- Twenty, maybe less, sir.

780
01:42:05,532 --> 01:42:08,899
We're leaving.
Together.

781
01:42:09,938 --> 01:42:11,200
Don't be afraid.

782
01:42:12,073 --> 01:42:13,734
Nothing is going to happen to you.

783
01:42:20,116 --> 01:42:21,743
Put them on picket duty
at the tree line.

784
01:42:21,884 --> 01:42:24,011
If the rest of the squad gets back,
have it report immediately to me.

785
01:42:24,253 --> 01:42:27,745
Radio for reinforcements, now.

786
01:42:27,923 --> 01:42:29,220
Yes, Captain.

787
01:42:56,053 --> 01:42:57,281
Leave him!

788
01:43:43,367 --> 01:43:44,629
Ofelia!

789
01:45:11,790 --> 01:45:14,486
Quickly, Your Majesty,

790
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:17,285
give him to me.

791
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:20,924
The full moon is high in the sky,

792
01:45:21,033 --> 01:45:23,866
we can open the portal.

793
01:45:24,770 --> 01:45:26,397
Why is that in your hand?

794
01:45:27,906 --> 01:45:32,809
The portal will only open
if we offer the blood of an innocent.

795
01:45:33,112 --> 01:45:37,549
Just a drop of blood.
A pinprick, that's all.

796
01:45:37,649 --> 01:45:40,243
It's the final task.

797
01:45:40,553 --> 01:45:41,884
Hurry.

798
01:45:44,591 --> 01:45:47,685
You promised to obey me!

799
01:45:48,127 --> 01:45:50,357
- Give me the boy!
- No!

800
01:45:50,964 --> 01:45:53,091
My brother stays with me.

801
01:45:53,332 --> 01:45:59,237
You would give up your sacred rights
for this brat you barely know?

802
01:45:59,305 --> 01:46:02,103
Yes, I would.

803
01:46:03,410 --> 01:46:05,878
You would give up
your throne for him?

804
01:46:06,013 --> 01:46:10,609
He who has caused you
such misery, such humiliation?

805
01:46:11,150 --> 01:46:14,017
Yes, I would.

806
01:46:18,124 --> 01:46:23,824
As you wish, Your Highness.

807
01:46:39,547 --> 01:46:40,571
No!

808
01:47:39,273 --> 01:47:40,262
My son.

809
01:48:07,869 --> 01:48:09,530
Tell my son...

810
01:48:15,378 --> 01:48:17,471
Tell him what time his father died.

811
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:19,577
- Tell him that I...
- No.

812
01:48:20,784 --> 01:48:22,547
He won't even know your name.

813
01:50:05,389 --> 01:50:07,414
Arise, my daughter.

814
01:50:10,729 --> 01:50:11,991
Come.

815
01:50:38,222 --> 01:50:39,450
Father.

816
01:50:39,957 --> 01:50:43,586
You have spilled your own blood
rather than that of an innocent.

817
01:50:44,362 --> 01:50:48,196
That was the final task,
and the most important.

818
01:50:58,709 --> 01:51:03,976
And you chose well,
Your Highness.

819
01:51:04,215 --> 01:51:05,876
Come here with me,

820
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:08,879
and sit by your father's side.

821
01:51:09,354 --> 01:51:11,549
He's been waiting for you so long.

822
01:52:04,477 --> 01:52:08,243
And it is said the princess
returned to her father's kingdom.

823
01:52:09,182 --> 01:52:14,518
That she reigned there with justice
and a kind heart for many centuries.

824
01:52:15,423 --> 01:52:17,687
That she was loved by her people.

825
01:52:17,958 --> 01:52:22,657
And that she left behind
small traces of her time on earth,

826
01:52:23,764 --> 01:52:28,599
visible only to those
who know where to look.
