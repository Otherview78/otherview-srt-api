1
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,590
The Ring of the Fisherman, which bears the official papal seal

2
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,900
Must be destroyed immediately following the pope's death.

3
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,640
The papal apartment is then sealed for 9 days of mourning,

4
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,440
A period known as sede vacante:

5
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,320
The time of the empty throne.

6
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,990
Over the last several days,

7
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,160
Catholic leaders from every corner of the world,

8
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,380
Have flocked to Rome, shocked by the sudden death,

9
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,590
Of this progressive and beloved pope.

10
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,670
Today, in St. Peter's Square,

11
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,260
The faithful pray that there is among them

12
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,970
another leader who can unite their Church

13
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,230
which has been so riven by change and dissent in recent years.

14
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,020
As the body of the pontiff passes by,

15
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,480
We see prayers are being offered by the preferiti,

16
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,860
Favorites among those being considered

17
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,080
To succeed him as the Vicar of Christ.

18
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,340
At the end of the mourning period, the College of Cardinals

19
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,970
Will lock itself behind the doors of the Sistine Chapel

20
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,390
for conclave The process by which they will choose

21
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,180
a new leader for the world's one billion Catholics

22
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,140
who now find their church at a crossroads

23
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,360
its ancient traditions threatened by a modern world.

24
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:05,080
Attention, control group going online for LHC beam event.

25
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,460
We are powering up.

26
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,420
Attention, Category One personnel:

27
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,140
interlock areas are now restricted.

28
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,510
You pulled us off the power grid, Philippe.

29
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,300
Because you're scaring the hell out of everyone.

30
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,050
The collider was never intended to generate antimatter.

31
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,600
All three canisters are stored under every possible safeguard.

32
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,400
I'm only asking you to wait.

33
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,650
We can't wait. The bulk of the antimatter is generated at start-up.

34
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,280
Put us back online.

35
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,990
Do you want to call the director, or shall I?

36
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,780
ATLAS underground is now in restricted mode.

37
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,370
Vittoria, Vittoria.

38
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,330
Protons are being loaded.

39
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,040
Don't blow us all to heaven.

40
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,370
Please.

41
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,630
Powering on LHC magnets.

42
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,380
Ion source stage in four, three, two...

43
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,300
Start the collision sequence.

44
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,440
Vittoria, what did Philippe want?

45
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,030
They're terrified. He wants us to wait. What do you think?

46
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,400
I think if we don't harvest now, we never will.

47
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,150
Beam-on-beam stability is good. Take your places, people.

48
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,190
ATLAS at CMS, check.

49
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,330
Sending timing trigger now. Collisions imminent.

50
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,880
We have got 10 to the 13th protons per bunch.

51
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,410
Let's hope the heavy ion guys didn't mess up.

52
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,720
Beams at relativistic velocities.

53
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,210
Luminosity monitors operational.

54
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,590
Beamline has no restrictions.

55
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,550
Enable beam capture.

56
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,930
Accelerating the beam.

57
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,930
Stage one, line up.

58
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,720
Magnets to full field.

59
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,520
Load functions to magnets.

60
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,600
Last P is still too high.

61
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,990
Yeah, we got luminosity of 10 to 34.

62
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,870
Inject particle beams.

63
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,740
Filling the LHC.

64
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,160
Collisions are active. We should be back online.

65
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,120
Capture should begin at any moment.

66
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,880
Particles in transition.

67
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,290
Collisions are fixed and running.

68
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,850
LHC injecting protons, beam one.

69
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,970
Lock the feedback systems.

70
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,810
Particles at 99 percent the speed of light.

71
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,150
Colliding stable beams.

72
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,820
Enact injection kicker.

73
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,020
We have a signal on the luminosity monitors.

74
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,450
We have events.

75
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,830
Protons are moving.

76
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,440
We have antimatter.

77
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,990
It's on a scale never seen before.

78
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,080
That's a crate of beer on the way.

79
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,460
Silvano, we've done it.

80
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,840
We're in God's hands now, Vittoria.

81
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,800
I'll be right down.

82
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,570
Silvano.

83
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,910
Silvano.

84
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,890
Oh, God.

85
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,180
Help.

86
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,330
A swim might help your jet lag.

87
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,030
I beg your pardon?

88
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,160
You got bags under your eyes. It's 5 in the morning.

89
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,250
And you're from the Vatican.

90
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,590
Crossed keys under the triregnum.

91
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,090
It's a papal symbol.

92
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,760
Claudio Vincenzi, Corpo della Gendarmeria Vaticano.

93
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,310
Vatican police?

94
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,690
I was expecting another letter.

95
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,940
My request for access to your archives.

96
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,140
Shouldn't you be in Rome?

97
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,360
A kind of busy time for you guys, isn't it?

98
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,650
In fact, I was in New York, detailed to the U.N.

99
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,200
I receive a phone call in the middle of the night:

100
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,740
"Find Professor Robert Langdon.

101
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,590
A matter of great urgency."

102
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,980
They said to show you this.

103
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,110
The Illuminati? They disappeared hundreds of years ago.

104
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,950
Did they? Look at that again.

105
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,200
It's an ambigram.

106
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,450
It's the same image forward and backward.

107
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,790
Now, that's common for a symbol, like a yin and yang or a swastika

108
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,210
But that's a word.

109
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,290
That Illuminati ambigramatic symbol

110
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,290
Has been considered a myth for 400 years.

111
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,090
Supposedly, in the 16th century

112
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,260
Some artist created it as a tribute to Galileo's love of symmetry.

113
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,880
It was only gonna be revealed

114
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,300
When the Illuminati had amassed enough power

115
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,680
To resurface and carry out their final goal.

116
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,230
I wrote a book about it.

117
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,690
Which is why you're here.

118
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,980
The Art of the Illuminati by Robert Langdon.

119
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,480
Part One.

120
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,610
Haven't been able to finish Part Two. I'm not allowed access

121
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,620
to your archives.

122
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,460
It's remarkable. Singular.

123
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,330
Someone is trying to make you believe

124
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,960
the Illuminati themselves have returned to Rome.

125
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,570
Right after the death of a pope.

126
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,950
Four cardinals were kidnapped from inside the Vatican

127
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,030
sometime between 3 and 5 a. m. this morning.

128
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,910
Shortly afterward

129
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,000
that document was sent to the Office of the Swiss Guard

130
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,790
along with the threat the cardinals will be publicly executed

131
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,760
one per hour, beginning at 8 p. m. tonight in Rome.

132
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,600
- Conclave. - Was to begin today.

133
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,110
We've postponed its start for a few hours, a story of illness.

134
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,620
There are no suspicions yet.

135
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,240
What do you want from me?

136
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,610
These criminals who sent this ambigram

137
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,620
meant it as a taunt, a provocation.

138
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,450
But Captain Olivetti think if you can use it to learn their identity

139
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,840
perhaps we can stop this abomination.

140
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,300
Why me?

141
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,100
Your expertise. Your erudition.

142
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,940
Your recent involvement with certain Church, shall we say

143
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,820
mysteries.

144
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,640
I wasn't under the impression that episode

145
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,810
had endeared me to the Vatican.

146
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,320
Oh, it didn't.

147
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,320
But it did make you... What's the word?

148
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,410
formidabile.

149
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,500
Formidable.

150
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,490
A Vatican jet is standing by 20 minutes from here.

151
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,960
Will you come with me?

152
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,380
Professore Langdon, you've spent your life

153
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,890
searching for symbols like the one you now hold in your hand.

154
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,220
How much longer are we going to pretend

155
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,850
you have not already decided to come?

156
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,560
If the Illuminati have returned and are in Rome

157
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,990
we will hunt them down and kill them.

158
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,940
The Illuminati did not become violent

159
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,240
until the 17th century. Their name means "the enlightened ones"

160
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,410
They were physicists and mathematicians, astronomers.

161
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,450
They were concerned with the Church's inaccurate teaching

162
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,580
and were dedicated to scientific truth.

163
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,290
But the Vatican didn't like that.

164
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,460
So the church began to... How did you say it?

165
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,670
Oh,"hunt them down and kill them."

166
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,560
Drove them underground.

167
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,140
Into a secret society.

168
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,580
Excuse me.

169
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,830
Comandante Richter assures me the guard

170
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,420
is doing everything humanly possible to find the preferiti.

171
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,640
A long way to say very little.

172
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,260
What if you were to begin in their absence?

173
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,180
They are the four leading candidates.

174
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,510
If they're not present, they're not eligible.

175
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,690
There will be no consensus without them.

176
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,110
Who are we to vote for?

177
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,190
It is as much as sin to offer flattery as to accept it.

178
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,160
May I suggest you at least consider the possibility.

179
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,990
No, no, no. There is no possibility.

180
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,960
I have been chosen Great Elector. I am not eligible.

181
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,080
Camerlengo asks how long we can postpone the opening prayer...

182
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,960
...without making another announcement to the public.

183
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,620
Tell the camerlengo

184
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,800
the cardinal-elect will take every minute required...

185
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,230
...to perform the sacred trust.

186
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,900
No further announcements are necessary.

187
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,350
He'll be concerned about the public dimension.

188
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,610
People will think-

189
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,280
What we tell them to think.

190
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,820
- Professor Langdon. - Yes.

191
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,000
Welcome to Vatican City.

192
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,460
Ernesto Olivetti

193
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,080
inspector general of the Vatican police force.

194
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,210
- My pleasure. - This way, please.

195
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,170
We'll meet in the headquarters of the Swiss Guard.

196
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,380
I thought you were Swiss Guard.

197
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,210
No, la Gendarmeria.

198
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,800
We are responsible for everything inside the Vatican walls...

199
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:44,400
...with the exception of the security of His Holiness and the Apostolic palace

200
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,130
That is Swiss Guard.

201
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,930
The Roman carabinieri are here as well in an advisory capacity.

202
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,760
So jurisdictionally, this is...

203
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,940
A goddamn nightmare.

204
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,650
Oh, yes, Pope Pius IX's great castration.

205
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,780
- I beg your pardon? - 1857, Pope Pius IX...

206
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,490
...felt the male form would inspire lust.

207
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,160
So he took a hammer and chisel...

208
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,130
...and unmanned hundreds of these statues.

209
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,220
The plaster fig leaves were added later.

210
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,750
Are you anti-Catholic, Professor Langdon?

211
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,470
No. I'm anti-vandalism.

212
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,610
I urge you to guard your tone here.

213
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,730
The Swiss Guard is a calling, not a profession...

214
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:43,690
and it encourages a certain civiltry.

215
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,820
Commander Richter, the head of the Guard...

216
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,650
...is a deeply spiritual man...

217
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,360
...and he was close to the late pope. Understood?

218
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,240
Look, I don't study symbols

219
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,660
because I consider them unimportant.

220
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,160
Ceremony, traditions, it's how we mark our lives.

221
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,200
I just- I just hope I can help.

222
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,000
So do I.

223
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,720
You were my idea.

224
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,520
Wait here. Please.

225
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,060
Commander?

226
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,690
Commander Richter?

227
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,110
Professor Langdon is here.

228
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,200
Well, we have bigger problems than that now.

229
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,790
Dr. Vetra?

230
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,580
I'm Commander Richter, comandante principale of the Swiss Guard.

231
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,040
Thank you for coming.

232
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,880
Hello.

233
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,250
- Professor Langdon. - Yes.

234
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,920
What a relief, the symbologist is here.

235
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,220
This way, please, Miss Vetra.

236
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,840
The situation has changed.

237
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,300
We received another treat from the kidnapper.

238
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,260
The canister was stolen from our lab around noon yesterday.

239
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,270
The intruder killed my research partner,

240
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,970
Silvano Bentivoglio...

241
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,440
...and mutilated him in order to bypass security.

242
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,530
We use retinal scanners.

243
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,200
They cut out his eye.

244
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,740
Is that our stolen canister, Miss Vetra?

245
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,410
Where is that camera, Number 86?

246
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,200
It's wireless. It too was stolen.

247
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,200
It could be anywhere inside the Vatican.

248
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,670
That canister contains an extremely combustible substance

249
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,450
called antimatter

250
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,500
We need to locate it immediately or evacuate Vatican City.

251
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,170
I'm quite familiar with incendiaries, Miss Vetra.

252
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,630
I've never heard of antimatter being used as such.

253
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,800
Well, it's never been generated in significant quantities before.

254
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,680
It's a way of studying the origins of the universe...

255
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,720
...to try to isolate what some people call "the God particle"

256
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,100
But there are implications for energy research-

257
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,280
"The God particle"?

258
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,980
What we call it isn't important.

259
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,810
It's what gives all matter mass.

260
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,940
The thing without which we could not exist.

261
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,820
You're talking about the moment of creation.

262
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,750
Yes. In a way, I am.

263
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,740
The antimatter is suspended there...

264
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,490
...in an airtight nanocomposite shell with electromagnets in each end.

265
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,960
If it were to fall out of suspension and come in contact with matter...

266
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,000
...say, the bottom of the canister, the two opposing forces...

267
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,250
...would annihilate one another violently.

268
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,710
And what might cause it to fall out of suspension?

269
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,300
The battery going dead.

270
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,800
- Which it will, just before midnight. - What kind of annihilation?

271
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,810
- How violent? - A cataclysmic event.

272
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:25,480
A blinding explosion equivalent to about five kilotons.

273
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,660
Vatican city will be consumed by light.

274
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,990
Those are the exact words the kidnapper used.

275
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,710
We will destroy your four pillars.

276
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,410
We will brand you preferiti...

277
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,910
...and sacrifice them on the altars of science...

278
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,040
...then bring your church down upon you.

279
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,710
Vatican City will be consumed by light.

280
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,180
A shining star at the end of the Path of Illumination.

281
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,600
It's the ancient Illuminati threat.

282
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,690
Destruction of Vatican city through light.

283
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:09,440
Four pillars, there's your kidnapped cardinals.

284
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,440
You didn't tell me they were the preferiti

285
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,530
the favorites to be named the next pope.

286
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,910
Play it again.

287
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,130
We will destroy your four pillars.

288
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,380
We will brand you preferiti...

289
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,890
Wait, stop it. Stop it.

290
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,350
"Brand" them.

291
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,390
That's another Illuminati legend.

292
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:46,930
This one says that there are a set of five brands...

293
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,310
...each one an ambigram.

294
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,020
The first four are the fundamental elements of science:

295
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,270
Earth, air, fire and water.

296
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,080
The fifth, it's a mystery.

297
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,250
Maybe it's this.

298
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,540
He said they'd be killed publicly.

299
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,250
Yes.

300
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,250
Revenge for la purga.

301
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,050
"La purga"?

302
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,920
Oh, jeez, you guys don't even read your own history, do you?

303
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:19,090
1668, the Church kidnapped four Illuminati scientists...

304
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,380
...and branded each one of them on the chest...

305
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,470
...with the symbol of the cross...

306
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,220
...to purge them of their sins, and they executed them.

307
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,640
Threw their bodies into the street as a warning...

308
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,440
...to others to stop questioning Church rulings on scientific matter.

309
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,650
They radicalized them.

310
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:36,770
The purga created a darker, more violent Illuminati...

311
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,620
...one bent on retribution.

312
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,070
Look how they intend to finally get it:

313
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,660
Using antimatter, technology, to destroy the Church.

314
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,250
Science obliterates religion.

315
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,260
Is there any more?

316
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,040
and sacrifice them on the altars of science...

317
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,090
...then bring your church down upon you.

318
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,720
Vatican City will be consumed by light.

319
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,140
a shining star at the end of the Path of Illumination.

320
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,570
"Path of Illumination."

321
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,900
I need access to the Vatican archives.

322
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,320
Professor, I don't think this is the appropriate-

323
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,360
Your petition has been denied seven times,

324
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,030
No, no. This has nothing to do with my work. The Path of Illumination...

325
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,030
...is a trail that leads to the Church of the Illumination...

326
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:31,290
...the place where the Illuminati would meet in secret.

327
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,840
If I can find the segno, the sign that marks the beginning of that path

328
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:38,500
the four churches along it...

329
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,420
...may be where he intends to murder your cardinals.

330
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,380
One every hour at 8,9,10 and 11.

331
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,350
Then the device explodes at midnight.

332
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,100
If we can figure out the first church and get there before he does...

333
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,390
...maybe we can stop it. But I can't find the start of the path...

334
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,610
...until I get into the archives.

335
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,150
Even if I wanted to help you...

336
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,820
...access to the archives is only by written decree...

337
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,860
...by the curator and the Board of Vatican Librarians.

338
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,700
Or by papal mandate.

339
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,840
Yes, but as you no doubt have heard, the Holy Father is dead.

340
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,830
What about il camerlengo?

341
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:16,330
The camerlengo is just a priest here, the former pope's chamberlain.

342
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:20,640
Doesn't the power of the Holy See rest in him during tempe sede vacante?

343
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,480
Fellas, you called me.

344
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,430
His Holiness once told me a pope...

345
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:38,230
...was a man torn between the real world and the divine.

346
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,700
It seems the real world is upon us tonight.

347
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,370
I'm familiar with Illuminati lore and the legend of the brandings.

348
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,950
La purga is a dark stain on this Church's history.

349
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,290
I'm not surprised this ghost has returned to haunt us.

350
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,750
Comandante, have you begun the search for this explosive device?

351
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,630
Of course, but it could be anywhere.

352
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,170
My primary concern at the moment

353
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,710
is the safety of the cardinals.

354
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,880
The Sistine Chapel is a fortress.

355
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,980
as long as the cardinals are in conclave,

356
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,760
your security concerns...

357
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,170
...are at a minimum.

358
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,470
Devote as many of your resources-

359
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,850
If you're about to suggest a naked-eye search...

360
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,540
...of the entire Vatican City,

361
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,390
I will tell you we do not have the people.

362
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,310
Though I'm not His Holiness,

363
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,560
when you are addressing me...

364
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,280
...you are addressing this office. Do you understand?

365
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,620
Yes, Father.

366
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,950
Good.

367
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,530
You said the image on the screen

368
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,740
was illuminated by artificial light.

369
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,040
Might I suggest methodically cutting power...

370
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,330
...to various sections of the city.

371
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,080
When the image goes dark, you'll have a specific idea...

372
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,470
...of the camera's location.

373
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,220
Dr. Vetra, besides yourself and your research partner...

374
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,940
...who else knew about this antimatter project?

375
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,720
No one but the research ream.

376
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,600
This project was strictly confidential.

377
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,690
But Silvano kept detailed journals.

378
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,280
If he told anyone else...

379
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,270
...about what we were doing, he would have made a note.

380
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,860
Do you have these journals?

381
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,570
I can have them flown here from Geneva in an hour.

382
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,540
Please.

383
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,250
Professor Langdon.

384
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:28,310
Mr. Langdon, you are correct that

385
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,060
I may grant you access to the archives.

386
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,800
Thank you, Padre.

387
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,860
I said that you were correct that I may, not that I will.

388
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,030
Christianity's most sacred codices are in that archive.

389
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,820
Given your recent entanglement with the Church...

390
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,320
...there is a question I'd like to ask you first...

391
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,080
...in the office of His Holiness.

392
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,550
Do you believe in God, sir?

393
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,590
Father, I simply believe that religion-

394
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:13,260
I did not ask if you believe what man says about God.

395
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,390
I asked if you believe in God

396
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,070
I'm an academic.

397
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,100
My minds tells me I will never...

398
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,860
...understand God.

399
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,490
And your heart?

400
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,620
Tells me I'm not meant to.

401
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,620
Faith is a gift...

402
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,080
...that I have yet to receive.

403
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,180
Be delicate with our treasures.

404
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,630
The archives are this way.

405
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,850
Professor Langdon.

406
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,050
If this path really leads to

407
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,970
the Church of Illumination...

408
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,480
...that way may be where they've hidden the antimatter.

409
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,440
"A shining star at the end of the path."

410
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,650
Follow the path.

411
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,220
We may find the canister.

412
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,650
Can you deactivate the device?

413
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,150
I can change the batteries...

414
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,570
...as long as we have more than five minutes.

415
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,090
That would give us another 24 hours

416
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,120
to get it safely back to CERN.

417
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,120
Robert Langdon

418
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,950
Vittoria Vetra.

419
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:27,630
Are you really a symbologist, or was he mocking you?

420
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,960
Well, both. You're a physicist?

421
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,170
Bio-entanglement physics.

422
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,340
Interconnectivity of life system.

423
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,800
Okay.

424
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,010
Your project, it was geared towards energy research?

425
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,350
Eventually, yes.

426
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,760
One speck of antimatter

427
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,600
could power an entire city for a month.

428
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,240
Or tonight, I guess, destroy one.

429
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,150
What are we looking for in the archives?

430
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,020
Abound volume written by Galileo.

431
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,820
Galileo was Illuminati?

432
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,690
Yeah. And an obedient Catholic who didn't think...

433
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:57,740
...that Church and science were enemies.

434
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,240
...but a different language telling the same story.

435
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,210
He wanted like minds

436
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,080
to find the Church of Illumination...

437
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,580
...but he couldn't exactly advertise its location

438
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,630
so he created a coded path.

439
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,150
Richter has started to turn off the power

440
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,880
of various grids.

441
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,300
It'll be back on in a minute.

442
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,610
Then some unknown Illuminati master

443
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,520
sculpted four statues.

444
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,600
Each one a tribute to one of the fundamental elements...

445
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,510
...earth, air, fire, water...

446
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,340
...and placed the statues out in public

447
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,140
in churches throughout Rome.

448
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,900
Each statue held a clue pointing to the next.

449
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,570
At the end of the path was the Church of Illumination.

450
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,690
If you could find that, you were one of them.

451
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,610
What makes you thinking

452
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,750
he's going to murder in the churches?

453
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,120
The Illuminati called those four churches...

454
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,120
...by the special name L'altare della scienza.

455
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,250
"Sacrifice them on the altars of science," he said.

456
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,220
Exactly.

457
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:56,310
Oh, wow. Look at this.

458
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,920
Excuse me, signore.

459
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:28,000
Cardinal Strauss, you've been informed of the situation?

460
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,760
Yeah.

461
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:30,740
My belief is we should proceed with

462
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,670
the sealing of conclave.

463
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:37,630
At this late hour? That would be highly unorthodox.

464
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,940
And yet within Church law.

465
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,260
It's my power. I am Great Elector.

466
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,590
The cruelest honor in Christendom.

467
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:47,140
I have no personal ambitions, Patrick.

468
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,140
Only those I hold for my Church, St. Peter's Church...

469
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,150
...which is under attack at its most vulnerable moment.

470
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,730
And this is not a coincidence.

471
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,730
The Church will not fall in a day.

472
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,320
We must evacuate Vatican City.

473
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,400
Oh, That is exactly what they want.

474
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,240
Publicity and panic.

475
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,540
No, we must not give them oxygen for the media fire.

476
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,660
But the people in St. Peter's Square-

477
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,000
Care deeply about their Church, as we do.

478
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,590
Their faith will sustain them.

479
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:20,260
Their faith will not protect them from an explosion.

480
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,970
Well...

481
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:26,640
We are all bound for heaven eventually, are we not?

482
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,600
Spoken like one who has enjoyed

483
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,180
the blessings of a long and full life.

484
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,850
Patrick...

485
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,210
...do not confuse the power

486
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,270
of the office you temporarily hold...

487
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,490
...with your true place here in the Vatican.

488
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,830
You were a favorite of His Holiness...

489
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:46,830
...but His Holiness is with his father now.

490
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,630
Mea culpa.

491
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,050
Seal the doors.

492
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,020
Extra Omnes.

493
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,220
Hello. This way, please.

494
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,940
Oh, beautiful.

495
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,470
The chambers are hermetic vaults.

496
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:41,800
Oxygen is kept at lowest possible levels.

497
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,850
It's a partial vacuum inside.

498
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,650
So extended stays are not recommended.

499
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,440
So don't panic if you fell lightheaded at first.

500
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,210
I'll be just outside the door.

501
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,030
Watching you, Mr. Langdon.

502
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,170
By the way, it's normal to feel a little light-headed.

503
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,480
Yeah.

504
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,260
Feels like I'm scuba diving with the wrong mixture.

505
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,390
Take a second. We have time.

506
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,970
Actually, I take that back.

507
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:41,070
- Is that Mickey Mouse? - Yeah. It's a long story.

508
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:35,440
Conclave will go on without us.

509
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,530
It must, now of all times.

510
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,540
May God forgive you for what you've done.

511
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,340
Father, if God has issues...

512
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,460
...they won't be with what I've done.

513
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,560
They will be with what I'm about to do.

514
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,240
It was confiscated from the Netherlands...

515
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,490
...by the Vatican just after Galileo died.

516
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:29,120
I've been petitioning to see it for about 10 years...

517
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,920
...ever since I realized what was in it.

518
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,000
What makes you so sure the segno's there?

519
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,550
The number 503.

520
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,050
I kept seeing it over and over again

521
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:40,410
in Illuminati letters scribbled in the margins,

522
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:43,680
sometimes just signed "503."

523
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,510
It's a numeric clue. But to what?

524
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,240
Five?

525
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,600
Well, that's a meaningful number to the Illuminati.

526
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,700
There's the pentagram,

527
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,060
Pythagoras, dozens of other examples in science.

528
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,270
But what about three?

529
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,660
Didn't make sense until I thought,

530
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,610
"What if it's Roman numerals?"

531
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:00,650
- DIII. - D-three. Galileo's third text.

532
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:05,880
"Dialogo. Discorso. Diagramma."

533
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,800
Yeah.

534
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,210
Just a few fays with this...

535
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,550
and I could have actually finished my book...

536
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:24,140
...and sold dozens of copies at the Harvard bookstore.

537
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,890
"IL Diagramma Veritatis."

538
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,020
Diagram of Truth.

539
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,780
I know about Dialogo and Discorsi.

540
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,230
Galileo laid out his theories about

541
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,560
the Earth revolving around the sun.

542
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,540
Yeah, and said

543
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,650
the Earth was not the center of some universe...

544
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,310
...with heaven above, hell below,

545
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,440
as the Church had said.

546
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,810
So they forced him to recant in the second book.

547
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:44,990
But what was this one?

548
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,780
This is how he got the word out.

549
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,870
This is the truth,

550
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,740
not what the Vatican forced him to write.

551
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,070
Smuggled out of Rome,

552
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,500
printed in Holland on sedge papyrus, see?

553
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,560
That way any scientist caught with a copy

554
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,040
could just throw it in water...

555
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,970
...and Galileo's heresy would dissolve, disappear.

556
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,420
And between that and Vatican burnings...

557
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,260
...it's possible that

558
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,890
this is the only copy that remains.

559
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,930
And if I'm correct...

560
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:13,770
...the segno is hidden on page number-

561
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,520
Five.

562
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,360
Yeah.

563
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,500
Do you need help with the Latin?

564
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,750
Sure.

565
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:40,090
Movement of the planets, elliptical orbits, heliocentricity...

566
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,970
Sorry. I don't think there's anything that could be interpreted as a...

567
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,470
Wait, wait, wait.

568
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,770
Do that again.

569
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,440
What is that?

570
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,440
Wait. It's a watermark. And there's a line of text.

571
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,910
Go back.

572
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,110
It's in English.

573
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:06,650
English? Why English?

574
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,440
English wasn't used in the Vatican.

575
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,700
It was too polluted.

576
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,410
It's free thinking. It was the language of radicals,

577
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,290
like Shakespeare and Chaucer.

578
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:16,320
Here's another one.

579
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,750
"The path of light is laid a sacred test."

580
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:24,470
- Will you write this down as I dictate? - Sorry, Professor. No time.

581
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:32,190
Yeah, yeah. What the hell? Yeah.

582
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,700
Twenty minutes till eight.

583
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,700
- Where are we headed? - Hold on. Hold on.

584
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,000
I'll tell you in a minute. Let me see that page again.

585
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,830
Where did you get that paper?

586
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,290
We borrowed it.

587
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:06,710
"From Santi's earthly tomb, the demon's hole..."

588
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,010
Are you insane?

589
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,310
"Cross Rome the mystic elements unfold."

590
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:14,860
"The path of light is laid in a sacred test."

591
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:19,190
"Let angels guide thee on thy lofty quest."

592
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,810
You removed a document from the Vatican archives?

593
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,530
She did.

594
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,240
"From Santi's earthly tomb..."

595
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,580
- The first marker is at Santi's tomb. - Yeah.

596
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,990
- But who's Santi? - Raphael.

597
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:39,910
- Raphael? The sculptor? - Yeah. Santi was his last name.

598
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,920
So, the path starts at Raphael's tomb?

599
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,170
Raphael's buried at the Pantheon.

600
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:47,640
- Isn't the Pantheon a church? - The oldest Catholic church in Rome.

601
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,620
I just pulled a dozen of my best men for this.

602
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,450
- You better be right. - This is one of the busiest spot in all of Rome.

603
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:17,410
- He'd never get away with it. - The poem implies-

604
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,620
The poem? Unbelievable.

605
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,080
I'm basing this operation

606
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,790
...on an American's interpretation of a 400 year old poem.

607
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:27,800
The information we have clearly refers to Raphael's tomb

608
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,710
Raphael's tomb is inside that building.

609
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,850
Because the Vatican destroyed

610
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,970
all of the pagan statues in the late 1800s,

611
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:35,810
If this is the first marker,

612
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,680
Whatever clues were here to lead us are gone by now.

613
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,600
The path is dead.

614
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,280
So, this is it. Your only chance.

615
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,650
Separate approaches.

616
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:48,400
No closer than two blocks and no uniforms. Three minutes.

617
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,780
I'll need a set of eyes inside.

618
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,120
Excuse me?

619
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,520
Weightlifters in matching suits and earpieces?

620
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,700
They're hardly disguised.

621
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,830
- It's what I have. - Fine. I'll go in.

622
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:05,120
You don't have communication. You can't carry a walkie talkie.

623
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,250
- Tourists have cell phones. - No, no.

624
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,760
You can't send her in there alone.

625
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,810
All right. I won't.

626
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:27,200
Don't look so anxious. We're supposed to be married.

627
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,820
Well, maybe we're not getting along today.

628
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,750
Hold my hand.

629
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:40,670
- But don't crush it. - Sorry. A nervous newlywed.

630
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,170
Ooh. Look, honey. The oculus.

631
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,880
That could be the "demon's hole" in the poem.

632
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,840
Why are the tombs at an angle?

633
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,210
They're facing east to worship the rising sun.

634
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:54,920
But this is a Christian church.

635
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,220
New religions often adopt the existing customs and holidays

636
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,350
...to make conversion less of a shock.

637
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,890
Like the 25th of December?

638
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,520
It's the pagan celebration of the Unconquered Sun.

639
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,400
...and also makes a handy date for the birth of Christ.

640
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,230
- Let's check the recesses. - Okay.

641
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:13,740
I'll go to the right. I'll meet you in 180 degrees.

642
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,530
Follow me, please.

643
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:21,330
Now, the Pantheon, which means 'Temple of all Gods',

644
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:25,790
...was originally built as a temple to all the gods of ancient Rome...

645
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:28,120
...in 27 BC.

646
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,710
Although the building is usually credited...

647
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,220
...to Apollodorus of Damascus...

648
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,060
Robert!

649
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:40,640
Robert!

650
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,810
It's Raphael's tomb.

651
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:47,430
- But it's the wrong one. - What are you talking about?

652
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:49,880
He was moved here in 1759,

653
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,940
...a century after Diagramma was published.

654
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,690
Where was he originally buried?

655
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,940
Urbino, I think. "Santi's earthly tomb."

656
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,870
What could it possibly be? "Santi's earthly tomb."

657
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:04,420
Damn it! Santi's tomb.

658
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,920
It must mean the chapel that he built.

659
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,120
He's not buried in it. He designed it.

660
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,540
"The demon's hole." It's not that oculus.

661
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,290
It's an undercroft. It's a crypt.

662
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:15,260
- Are there any questions? - Yes.

663
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:17,460
Yes.

664
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,970
Did Raphael Santi ever design a chapel with an ossuary annex...

665
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:24,100
...and an angel figure commissioned by the Catholic church?

666
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:27,940
I'm sorry. I can only think of one.

667
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,310
One is good.

668
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:33,810
- Wrong? What do you mean? - It's the Chigi chapel...

669
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:36,150
...in the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo.

670
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,490
It was once called Capella della Terra,

671
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:39,490
The Chapel of the Earth.

672
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:41,990
Earth. The first element. That's it.

673
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:45,580
- You're certain about the Pantheon? - We have four minutes.

674
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,910
Back to the Vatican. You can't.

675
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:52,500
if you care at all about your church, you'll listen.

676
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,470
My church?

677
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,340
My church comforts the sick and dying.

678
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,880
My church feeds the hungry.

679
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,310
What does your church do, Mr. Langdon?

680
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,560
That's right. You don't have one.

681
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,480
Take him if you want. I'm done with him.

682
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:25,910
All right, this makes sense. Look, right in front of the church.

683
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:27,740
An obelisk. A lofty pyramid.

684
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:30,540
Egyptian symbol adopted by the Illuminati.

685
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,970
If he's going to kill him, he'll do it here.

686
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,610
Eight o'clock.

687
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:02,490
Robert.

688
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,600
No. No. Here. It's an Annulus.

689
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:53,830
Which one is the Chigi Chapel?

690
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,700
It's in one of these apses.

691
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,810
Pyramids in a Catholic church.

692
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:53,650
This is it. This is the Chigi Chapel.

693
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,130
The Demon's Hole.

694
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,670
But it's askew.

695
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:20,430
Come here.

696
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:29,430
Hand me your flashlight.

697
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:31,360
What's that?

698
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:33,030
I call as my witness Christ the Lord...

699
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:36,200
...who will be my judge, that my vote is given...

700
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:39,290
...to the one before God. I think should be elected.

701
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:05,620
I elect as the most high pontiff

702
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:08,230
Dominic Scolamiero.

703
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:24,450
Eduardo Rossi.

704
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:27,830
They are voting for themselves to prevent a majority.

705
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:31,660
They're waiting for the Preferiti to be rescued.

706
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:36,130
Perhaps we should as well, yes?

707
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:56,100
Not until the smoke is white...

708
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:59,690
...will the College of Cardinals have chosen a new Holy Father.

709
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:04,120
For now, the Vatican seat of ultimate power remains vacant.

710
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:13,070
Get the body out of there and search the rest of the building.

711
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:15,080
- Chartrand! - Sir.

712
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,660
Outside a perimeter. Secure but invisible.

713
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,370
No lights, no guns. Nobody knows.

714
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:20,580
- Understand? - Yes, sir.

715
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,710
I'm calling all off-duty.

716
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:24,840
No information.

717
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,710
Is it Raphael?

718
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:29,810
The chapel is Raphael.

719
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:32,940
But the sculptures are Bernini.

720
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,940
The unknown Illuminati master...

721
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:41,110
...Bernini?

722
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:44,020
He worked for the church.

723
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,610
Almost exclusively.

724
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:49,990
But the Illuminati were infiltrators.

725
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:53,620
There wasn't a powerful organization they didn't penetrate,

726
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:55,750
...including the Vatican,

727
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:57,290
by hiding in plain sight.

728
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:03,550
Habakkuk and the Angel.

729
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,210
He's the prophet that predicted the annihilation of the earth.

730
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:11,930
"Let angels guide thee on thy lofty quest."

731
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,270
This is the first marker.

732
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:19,320
The path is alive.

733
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,490
Southwest.

734
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:35,780
It was pointing southwest.

735
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,370
Earth, air, fire, water. We're looking for a Bernini sculpture

736
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:40,700
...having something to do with air.

737
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,790
The second church is somewhere southwest of here.

738
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:45,330
You're sure this time?

739
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:49,100
I need a map showing all the churches of Rome.

740
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,140
I could use it now.

741
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:33,010
All right. The purple layers with these black crosses represent the churches.

742
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:35,720
But nothing intersects the line until it hits...

743
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,420
Until it hits St. Peter's.

744
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,890
Michelangelo designed St. Peter's

745
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:39,820
...not Bernini.

746
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,430
Michelangelo designed the Basilica.

747
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:43,470
Bernini designed St. Peter's Square.

748
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:44,760
The second marker must be

749
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,820
a statue in St. Peter's Square

750
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,820
It's 10 minutes till 9. Can you go any faster?

751
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,710
Not unless you want the full attention

752
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:57,960
of the world press.

753
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:10,380
There was no consensus after the first ballot...

754
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:12,160
...but Cardinal Baggia, the Italian,

755
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,710
is the odds-on favorite...

756
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:18,430
There is no new Pope, but it is possible...

757
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:20,660
...that Cardinal Guidera, the Spaniard,

758
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,850
is the most probable...

759
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:25,560
It is possible that Cardinal Ebner,

760
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:29,650
from Germany, is the favorite...

761
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,820
Stem cell research is murder!

762
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:36,860
You're condemning sick people to die.

763
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,910
Man is not God.

764
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:53,090
There, another obelisk.

765
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:55,120
Check the crowd. It's almost 9.

766
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,600
He's gotta be here already.

767
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:34,170
There must be 100 statues up there.

768
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:37,430
None of them are angels. Those are all saints.

769
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:39,720
How in God's name would anyone

770
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,310
create a sculpture about air?

771
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,020
Bas-relief. Of course. It's still a sculpture.

772
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,860
Check the ground. Look at the carvings.

773
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:58,830
Look for another having something to do with air.

774
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,890
"West Ponente." West wind.

775
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,260
Vittoria!

776
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:25,810
Here it is.

777
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:29,850
West wind. An angel blowing out five streaks of air.

778
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:31,730
This is it.

779
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:37,510
Get the police!

780
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,340
Call an ambulance!

781
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,110
He's still alive.

782
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:09,210
His chest. They punctured his lungs.

783
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,890
Clear the square.

784
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:31,860
"From within your walls to squeeze life from the Bishop."

785
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,030
He's actually claiming responsibility

786
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:35,530
for the death of His Holiness.

787
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:38,080
That's ridiculous. He died of a stroke.

788
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:39,520
It implies the Illuminati murdered him

789
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,330
with his own medication.

790
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,470
What?

791
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:45,420
Down here.

792
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:48,550
"With man's solution we stilled his heart.

793
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:52,560
With his own needle did we pierce his unholy veil."

794
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:53,850
Did the Holy Father take

795
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:56,350
any kind of medication by injection?

796
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:57,820
Tinzaparin.

797
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:00,020
He had thrombophlebitis.

798
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:03,520
He took an injection every day. But no one knew that.

799
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,770
Someone knew.

800
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:08,280
Well, he had health concerns and seizures as well.

801
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,720
But he took steps to make sure

802
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:11,860
he was watched, for safety.

803
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:13,720
He didn't want it made public,

804
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,120
so we have no reason to discuss it.

805
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,830
Tinzaparin is lethal in the wrong dosage.

806
01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:20,410
An overdose could cause massive internal bleeding...

807
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:21,750
...and brain hemorrhages.

808
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,510
It might look like a stroke at first,

809
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:25,710
but in a few days his body would show signs.

810
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:27,290
This could easily be examined.

811
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:29,130
In case you're not aware of it...

812
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:32,680
...papal autopsy is prohibited by Vatican law.

813
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,090
We're not going to defile His Holiness's body...

814
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:36,890
...just because his enemies claims-

815
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:39,100
Why would they send this letter now?

816
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:40,100
Well, to cause panic.

817
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:42,600
"The sun will blind at midnight...

818
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,530
...and neither police nor professors can stop it. "

819
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:47,520
He knows I'm here.

820
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,610
Obviously they were hoping

821
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:50,530
this letter would become public.

822
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:52,700
We might be wise to preempt their attempt...

823
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:53,590
...by making an announcement of our own

824
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:55,990
to refute this absurd claim.

825
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:57,700
That's out of the question.

826
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:58,820
Cardinal Strauss has insisted

827
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:01,000
this entire matter be kept internal.

828
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,330
He shouldn't be aware of it. He's in conclave.

829
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:04,240
His final instructions before sealing the doors

830
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,420
were very clear.

831
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:10,760
Cardinal Strauss does not dictate Vatican protocols.

832
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:13,260
As you say, yet, technically...

833
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:14,970
...now that conclave has begun...

834
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:16,580
...it's his privilege and duty

835
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:18,180
to control public announcements.

836
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:19,250
I've drafted a release

837
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,020
about the incident in the piazze...

838
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,930
...but any other statements

839
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:24,690
are specifically prohibited.

840
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:28,200
For that, Cardinal has asked me to remind you

841
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,820
we have a chimney.

842
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:36,200
Commander Richter, the search for the device?

843
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,490
Well, we've turned the power on and off

844
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:40,240
to about 20 percent of Vatican City.

845
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:41,870
Nothing on the video yet.

846
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:43,040
We're running out of options.

847
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,040
How long would you need to evacuate?

848
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,610
If I pull all my men from the search for the bomb,

849
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:48,510
30 minutes.

850
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,060
Mr. Langdon.

851
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,880
You have been right so far about the path...

852
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,510
...It's now 9:15.

853
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:56,630
How quickly can you find the next church?

854
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:58,390
The lined on the carving pointed east,

855
01:03:58,390 --> 01:03:59,720
away from Vatican City.

856
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,720
But there were five of them, so there's room for error.

857
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,230
About 20 churched intersect those lines.

858
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:07,390
None of them have names that invoke fire.

859
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:08,640
So a Bernini sculpture must be

860
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,360
inside one of them that does.

861
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,650
We'll need to get into the archives to find it.

862
01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:15,790
- Would you escort Mr. Langdon? - Yes, Father.

863
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,240
Silcano's journals.

864
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:22,210
The killer's name could be in here. May I stay?

865
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:24,380
Please. Fine, of course.

866
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:27,880
Professor.

867
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:32,050
Would it surprise you to find those clothes suit you?

868
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:35,060
It would surprise the hell out of me.

869
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:53,740
The Vatican is expressing sympathy

870
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:55,190
for the mugging victim...

871
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:59,660
...a Dusseldorf tourist now confirmed dead...

872
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:04,290
The Vatican police have a suspect in custody...

873
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:07,580
The Vatican will allow the crowd

874
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:11,460
back into St. Peter's Square...

875
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:13,340
...where security will be doubled...

876
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:14,970
The Vatican did admit that

877
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:17,760
where there are crowds, so often follows crime.

878
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,570
We're trying now to

879
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:20,680
get the name of the tourist who was-

880
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,510
- Oh, wait. - Hand to the right. Keeping panning.

881
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:25,600
We're getting word now of smoke.

882
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:28,060
Smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney.

883
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:30,480
Apparently there's been another vote.

884
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,310
The smoke is black.

885
01:05:32,310 --> 01:05:33,220
Once again,

886
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,190
the cardinals have failed to reach consensus...

887
01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:38,080
...and the Catholic Church remains without a leader.

888
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:48,630
What are you looking for now?

889
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:51,040
Church assets.

890
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,750
I beg your pardon?

891
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:54,840
Artwork, It's valuable.

892
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:58,170
Corporations tend to keep track of their holdings.

893
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:00,760
The Catholic Church is not a corporation,

894
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,100
it's a beacon.

895
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:04,230
A source of inspiration for one billion

896
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:05,760
lost and frightened souls.

897
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,730
Sure, I get that. It's also a bank.

898
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:20,700
Commander Olivetti said

899
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:23,000
I was not to leave your side this time.

900
01:06:25,070 --> 01:06:26,580
It wasn't me, it was her.

901
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,130
Power is now cut to Zone 73.

902
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:29,630
No light reaction on the monitor.

903
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:33,440
Restore power and move on to 74.

904
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:45,240
What sort of signs?

905
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:48,330
I'm sorry?

906
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,090
If the Holy Father was given

907
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:56,450
an overdose of Tinzaparin...

908
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:58,750
...what signs would his body bear?

909
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:02,550
Bleeding of the oral mucosa.

910
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:05,040
His tongue.

911
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,520
Postmortem, the blood congeals and turns

912
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:09,470
the inside of the mouth black.

913
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:13,680
Even after 14 days?

914
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,430
It wouldn't show up

915
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:16,900
until at least a week after his death.

916
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:24,070
He was very important to me.

917
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,910
Yeah, I understand.

918
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:35,330
Will you come with me, please?

919
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,370
Signore, would you organize a security team...

920
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:47,000
...to escort Miss Vetra and myself down to the crypt?

921
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,550
- Yes, sir. - We'll be leaving straightaway.

922
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,120
Do you smoke?

923
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:13,940
A little bit.

924
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:16,870
Then you better sit down before you keel over.

925
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:21,630
And what's all that right here?

926
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:25,410
What does this say in Italian right here...

927
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:28,130
...next to the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa? Right here.

928
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:33,350
"Moved at suggestion of the artist."

929
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,140
"Moved"? To another church.

930
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:37,980
At the suggestion of Bernini?

931
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,150
I don't know.

932
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:44,600
Here, Translate all of this for me...

933
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,770
...and I'll buy you a pack of smokes.

934
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:48,770
I'm looking for a reference to fire.

935
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:50,660
Fires.

936
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:55,870
- "Seraphim," meaning "the firey one." - Right.

937
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:01,250
"His great, golden spear, a point of fire."

938
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:06,960
Then "woman left completely afire."

939
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:11,130
Ecstasy of Saint Teresa. Saint Teresa on fire.

940
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:14,390
So this sculpture was moved to this church?

941
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:17,400
Why did they shut down the system?

942
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,300
They know we're down here.

943
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:23,390
If there's no power, there's no oxygen.

944
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:26,690
- Can we get out? - The door is electronic.

945
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,650
Oh, God.

946
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:31,700
Well, that's disappointing.

947
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:34,610
Where are we going?

948
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:36,740
To see my father.

949
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:38,320
I don't understand.

950
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,370
I was so orphaned when I was 9 years of age.

951
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:42,410
A bombing in Ulster.

952
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:45,870
The UVF protesting the visit of a Catholic archbishop.

953
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:47,900
The archbishop felt responsible,

954
01:10:47,900 --> 01:10:50,710
and he adopted me the following day.

955
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:54,130
I was raised by him and by the Church.

956
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:56,710
He was the wisest man I ever met.

957
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:58,610
Even when I was young and stubborn,

958
01:10:58,610 --> 01:11:00,680
I wanted to be ordained.

959
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,710
But I was brought up in Italy,

960
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:04,350
so I also wanted to do my military service.

961
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:06,230
I wanted to fight.

962
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:09,940
He told me, "Learn to fly."

963
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:12,350
So I joined the Aeronautica Militare...

964
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:14,320
...flew helicopters,

965
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,280
bringing the wounded back to hospital.

966
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:17,650
He was a great man.

967
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:20,000
Your father died?

968
01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:22,580
Fourteen days ago.

969
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:25,740
Command, do you read me?

970
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,660
Power is off. Oxygen is very low.

971
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:30,960
Come in. Can you read me?

972
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,210
Can you get anything?

973
01:11:32,210 --> 01:11:36,760
No. The wall are lead-lined. There's no signal.

974
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,800
This way.

975
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:13,310
If the Holy Father was murdered, the implications are profound.

976
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,930
Vatican security is impenetrable.

977
01:15:15,930 --> 01:15:19,020
No one from the outside could have got anywhere near him.

978
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:20,810
It was someone on the inside.

979
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:23,910
And we can trust no one.

980
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,740
No light reaction on Zone 97.

981
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:33,030
Based on the rate the battery is using power...

982
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:36,420
...the device will detonate just before midnight.

983
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,360
Holy Father...

984
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:01,970
...when I was young,

985
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:04,740
You told me the voice in my heart was God's voice.

986
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:08,320
You said I should follow it, no matter how painful.

987
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:11,880
Forgive me, please.

988
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,930
Give me strength.

989
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:20,230
What I do, I do in the name of everything you believe.

990
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:32,410
Remove the cover.

991
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:37,530
Did you not hear me?

992
01:16:37,530 --> 01:16:40,740
Signore, by law, we are at your command, but...

993
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:43,090
One day I will ask your forgiveness

994
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:44,290
For putting you in this position.

995
01:16:44,290 --> 01:16:46,420
But today I ask your obedience.

996
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,920
Vatican laws are there to protect this church.

997
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,110
And it's in that spirit

998
01:16:52,110 --> 01:16:55,390
That I command you to break one of them now.

999
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,570
God help us.

1000
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:08,370
Santa Maria della Vittoria. Do you know it?

1001
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:11,920
- Yes, I do. - It's the next church.

1002
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:29,910
I think someone just tried to kill me.

1003
01:18:29,910 --> 01:18:32,410
I promise you we had no idea...

1004
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:33,270
- He knows I'm here. - Yes.

1005
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:34,200
You heard me ask permission.

1006
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,080
You gave me an escort.

1007
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:36,290
We had no idea...

1008
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:40,630
That portions of our white zones were cross-wired with that building.

1009
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:42,750
Commander Richter was extending the search.

1010
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:44,570
If he had known,

1011
01:18:44,570 --> 01:18:46,520
He never would have killed the power.

1012
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:49,720
Or there is the other possibility.

1013
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:52,520
Is it conceivable the Illuminati...

1014
01:18:53,350 --> 01:18:55,530
...have infiltrated the Swiss Guard?

1015
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:00,320
perhaps.

1016
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:08,200
I wanna speak to the camerlengo.

1017
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:10,280
The camerlengo is unavailable.

1018
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:14,250
He's found evidence that the Holy Father was indeed murdered.

1019
01:19:15,370 --> 01:19:18,010
- He is seeking guidance. - From whom?

1020
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:20,720
From God.

1021
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:22,760
- Make an effort, please. - Yeah, yeah.

1022
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:57,210
The journals. Where are they?

1023
01:19:59,910 --> 01:20:02,470
Who took the journals from this desk?

1024
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:12,550
Someone is here? What is this?

1025
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:15,560
Signore, this is unacceptable.

1026
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:17,600
For a camerlengo to enter the chapel

1027
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,350
Once conclave has begun...

1028
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:22,900
Forgive me. There's been a development.

1029
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:35,950
His Holiness Celestine V was murdered.

1030
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:39,910
Is it so hard to believe it could happen again?

1031
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:42,250
Signori, please a moment.

1032
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:45,130
Please, signori.

1033
01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:49,100
Our Church is at war.

1034
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:53,510
We are under attack from an old enemy.

1035
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:55,180
The Illuminati.

1036
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:57,940
They have struck us from within.

1037
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:00,570
Murdering our Holy Father.

1038
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,000
And threatening us all

1039
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,560
With destruction at the hands of their new god, science.

1040
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:07,460
They call it retribution.

1041
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:08,940
They think it justified.

1042
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:11,990
Because of Church's attacks on men of science in the past.

1043
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:13,950
And it's true.

1044
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:15,740
Since the days of Galileo...

1045
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:19,660
...this Church has tried to slow the relentless march of progress...

1046
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:22,250
...sometimes with misguided means.

1047
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:27,250
But science and religion are not enemies.

1048
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:29,090
There are simply some things...

1049
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:32,340
...that science is just too young to understand.

1050
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:34,880
So the Church pleads,

1051
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,730
"Stop. Slow down. Think. Wait."

1052
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:40,850
And for this they call us backward.

1053
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:43,320
But who is more ignorant...

1054
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:45,600
...the man who cannot define lightning...

1055
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,820
...or the man does not respect its natural awesome power?

1056
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:52,980
The battle is well underway, signori.

1057
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:55,230
We must defend ourselves.

1058
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:58,400
But what if this time we fight their stealth with openness?

1059
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,190
Combat their wicked scheme with simple truth...

1060
01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:04,540
...and end this brutish battle once and for all.

1061
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:09,430
We must open the doors,

1062
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:13,500
Tear down the blacken curtains and speak to our flock.

1063
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,580
If the outside world could see this Church as I do...

1064
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:18,920
...looking beyond the ritual of these walls...

1065
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:22,590
...they would see a modern miracle.

1066
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:25,760
A brotherhood of imperfect, simple souls...

1067
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:28,640
...who want nothing more than to be voices of compassion...

1068
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:32,310
...in a world spinning out of control.

1069
01:22:33,140 --> 01:22:36,940
Signori, I ask...

1070
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:42,450
...I pray... that you break this conclave.

1071
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:48,030
Open the doors... evacuate St. Peter's Square...

1072
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:51,250
...and tell the world the truth.

1073
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:26,710
Oh, my God.

1074
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,930
Get him down!

1075
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,930
No!

1076
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:42,850
There, there that chain. On that pulley.

1077
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:44,630
This bench!

1078
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:33,630
I'm a cop.

1079
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:53,730
My son...

1080
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:58,200
...God answers all prayers...

1081
01:26:59,190 --> 01:27:01,330
...but sometimes his answer is no.

1082
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:06,160
The college will not break conclave.

1083
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:08,790
May I suggest...

1084
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:10,870
...you direct your energies...

1085
01:27:10,870 --> 01:27:14,840
...to helping the Swiss Guard find this explosive device...

1086
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:17,170
...if it exists.

1087
01:27:18,170 --> 01:27:20,010
And leave Church leadership...

1088
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:24,180
...to its leaders.

1089
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:38,530
Eminence.

1090
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:43,070
There is a growing fear

1091
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:45,540
That without four preferiti...

1092
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:51,160
...a two-thirds majority for any candidate will not be possible.

1093
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:54,300
- Unless. - Speak plainly.

1094
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,870
It is recommendation of many...

1095
01:27:56,870 --> 01:28:00,800
...that you ask to be removed from your post as Great Elector...

1096
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:08,730
...thereby making yourself eligible... to wear the Ring of Fisherman.

1097
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:14,190
Well... if it is God's will...

1098
01:28:21,150 --> 01:28:23,200
...may his will be done.

1099
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:53,940
Signore, are you okay?

1100
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:20,200
Those journals are private property.

1101
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,670
I demand you return them.

1102
01:29:21,670 --> 01:29:25,550
They're material evidence in a Vatican investigation.

1103
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:28,910
I am an Italian citizen.

1104
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,210
My right do not end just because I crossed to the other.

1105
01:29:31,210 --> 01:29:32,300
This is not Italy.

1106
01:29:32,590 --> 01:29:34,800
It's not even Rome, it's the Vatican.

1107
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,760
A country of its own with its own laws.

1108
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:38,730
And when those journals passed the border,

1109
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:40,270
They became my property.

1110
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:42,270
I will give them back to you...

1111
01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:42,970
...when I've decided

1112
01:29:42,970 --> 01:29:45,770
They contain nothing of value to the investigation.

1113
01:29:45,770 --> 01:29:49,200
Do you have something to hide, Commandante Richter?

1114
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,000
Do you, Dr. Vetra?

1115
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:18,810
Were it up to me, it would not be this way.

1116
01:30:19,930 --> 01:30:22,900
It's a sin to kill with pain.

1117
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:25,860
It's a sin to kill without reason.

1118
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:34,290
Father, they make me a sinner.

1119
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:16,660
Saint Teresa on fire.

1120
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:21,410
Professor Langdon?

1121
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,410
- What direction is that? - West, I think.

1122
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:27,540
"Cross Rome the mystic element unfold."

1123
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:31,120
Piazza Barberini is here.

1124
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:34,420
Saint Teresa is here.

1125
01:31:34,710 --> 01:31:37,000
Where is the Santa Maria del Popolo?

1126
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,930
- Santa Maria del Popolo? - Yes.

1127
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:42,510
Thank you.

1128
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:45,220
St. Peter's is here.

1129
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:47,640
We are here.

1130
01:31:48,890 --> 01:31:50,730
A church with water.

1131
01:31:52,770 --> 01:31:54,730
Wait, wait, wait.

1132
01:31:54,730 --> 01:31:56,700
"Cross Rome."

1133
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:00,730
The poem must mean it literally, cross Rome.

1134
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:03,070
Professor, Commander Richter has ordered me...

1135
01:32:03,070 --> 01:32:04,950
...to escort you to the Vatican.

1136
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:06,280
Piazza Navona.

1137
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:10,200
Earth. Air. Fire. Water.

1138
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,330
Cross Rome.

1139
01:32:12,330 --> 01:32:14,800
Bernini's Four Rivers.

1140
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:16,380
Professor Langdon,

1141
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:18,710
The Vatican insists that I have to take you back.

1142
01:32:18,710 --> 01:32:21,880
The Vatican is about to see its fourth cardinal murdered tonight.

1143
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:24,650
Now, look. You can do as they say

1144
01:32:24,650 --> 01:32:26,970
And force me back to the Vatican...

1145
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:29,180
...Where we can all mourn his death together.

1146
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:31,840
Or you can show real cops act,

1147
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:33,270
And take me to the Piazza Navona.

1148
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:36,780
Where we still might be able to stop it.

1149
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:42,320
Oh, by all means, let's talk it over.

1150
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:45,290
In 14 minutes, he's gonna be dead.

1151
01:32:50,910 --> 01:32:52,380
This way, professor.

1152
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:02,710
Yes, Padre?

1153
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:06,720
At 11:15, if the Church is still in peril...

1154
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:09,890
...give the order to evacuate the cardinals.

1155
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:12,350
But with dignity.

1156
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:16,480
Let them walk out into St. Peter's Square with their heads held high.

1157
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:19,310
I don't want the last image of this Church to be of men...

1158
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:21,780
...sneaking out the back door.

1159
01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:40,920
"let angels guide thee..."

1160
01:33:46,010 --> 01:33:47,760
There it is.

1161
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,050
- There it is. - Professor, I know this fountain.

1162
01:33:50,050 --> 01:33:53,760
- There is no angel on it. - The dove. The Angel of Peace.

1163
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:56,270
And it's looking in what direction?

1164
01:33:56,270 --> 01:33:58,280
east, I think.

1165
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:11,000
Professor, just wait here.

1166
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:13,420
Stay put.

1167
01:34:49,740 --> 01:34:52,120
Good evening, can I help you?

1168
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:54,750
I'm waiting for a doctor.

1169
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,930
Come here.

1170
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:18,440
Stay calm, don't shoot.

1171
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:56,840
Hey!

1172
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:12,980
Help!

1173
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:14,320
Somebody help!

1174
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:55,400
Help! Somebody

1175
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:10,930
Cardinal Baggia?

1176
01:38:10,930 --> 01:38:12,480
Cardinal Baggia.

1177
01:38:14,470 --> 01:38:16,640
Where was he hiding you?

1178
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:19,070
The Church of Illumination. Where is it?

1179
01:38:19,390 --> 01:38:22,990
Castel-Castel Sant'Angelo.

1180
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:25,910
Castle of the Angel.

1181
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:51,850
Sir, there's news about Cardinal Baggia.

1182
01:38:52,090 --> 01:38:55,800
The cardinal told Langdon he was being held in Castel Sant'Angelo

1183
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:58,890
If Langdon's right, that's where the bomb is.

1184
01:38:58,890 --> 01:39:00,810
Send everyone we can spare.

1185
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:02,140
And you?

1186
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:04,150
I'm staying here.

1187
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,040
Vittoria.

1188
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:21,250
- You're all right? - I'm all right.

1189
01:39:21,250 --> 01:39:23,000
What about you? I just heard about Olivetti on the radio.

1190
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:24,680
I'm all right. I'm okay.

1191
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:34,090
Robert, we can't trust Richter. He took Silvano's journals.

1192
01:39:34,090 --> 01:39:36,970
There must be something in there he doesn't want us to see.

1193
01:39:36,970 --> 01:39:39,060
The head of the Swiss Guard.

1194
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:41,950
Castel Sant'Angelo. It's close enough

1195
01:39:41,950 --> 01:39:43,440
so the wireless signal from that camera...

1196
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,490
...could still reach the Vatican.

1197
01:39:47,110 --> 01:39:50,110
The Church of Illumination is somewhere here

1198
01:39:50,110 --> 01:39:52,700
and your canister is inside it

1199
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:14,520
Come with me.

1200
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:21,930
For 400 years, the Illuminati met right under the Church's nose.

1201
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:25,560
The Vatican used this as a hideout and as a prison for their enemies.

1202
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:30,610
If the explosion happens here, would the blast radius take out the Vatican?

1203
01:40:30,610 --> 01:40:32,950
And part of Rome along with it.

1204
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:36,370
Go on.

1205
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,010
They're pointing to it. The angels.

1206
01:40:53,010 --> 01:40:55,270
The container must be down there. Come on!

1207
01:41:43,350 --> 01:41:44,330
Where are they going?

1208
01:41:44,330 --> 01:41:45,850
Back to search the outer castle.

1209
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:48,490
No, no. It has to be here!

1210
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:55,190
Robert, it's a dead end.

1211
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:57,400
No, it's not.

1212
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:00,080
See if you can find a flashlight.

1213
01:42:16,710 --> 01:42:19,300
All of these stones are rectangular granite.

1214
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:22,690
Except right here. What is this?

1215
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:27,610
It's a pentagram

1216
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,110
An eye...

1217
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,270
that leads to...

1218
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:33,070
Nowhere.

1219
01:42:41,950 --> 01:42:43,500
Robert?

1220
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:47,790
These walls overlap and there's a passageway back here.

1221
01:42:47,790 --> 01:42:49,630
Here. Let me have the flashlight.

1222
01:43:13,150 --> 01:43:16,440
It's a passageway that leads to the Vatican.

1223
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,280
An ancient escape route.

1224
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:22,160
My God.

1225
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:26,460
Here.

1226
01:43:28,410 --> 01:43:30,630
Look.

1227
01:44:03,030 --> 01:44:07,200
Get on the radio. Get the word out. Conclave remains sealed.

1228
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:09,830
But the Camerlengo gave the order for evacuation at-

1229
01:44:09,830 --> 01:44:11,920
I'm countermanding it.

1230
01:44:17,210 --> 01:44:19,640
This is it. This is their church.

1231
01:44:21,710 --> 01:44:25,020
The canister should be lit by artificial light.

1232
01:44:48,490 --> 01:44:49,830
It's not here, Robert.

1233
01:44:49,830 --> 01:44:52,790
"A shining star at the end of the path. "It has to be.

1234
01:44:52,790 --> 01:44:54,830
It's not here.

1235
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:57,000
- What did the poem say? - Nothing.

1236
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:58,500
Nothing. It's all over.

1237
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:02,220
There was just four lines, each one describing...

1238
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:13,060
There's a fifth brand.

1239
01:45:13,430 --> 01:45:15,810
It's not an ambigram. It's just two crossed keys.

1240
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:18,900
- The symbol for the Vatican. - No.

1241
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:21,020
No, the papacy.

1242
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:22,610
They intend to kill him.

1243
01:45:22,610 --> 01:45:25,400
Before they destroy the Vatican, they're gonna kill...

1244
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:27,030
...and brand the pope himself.

1245
01:45:27,030 --> 01:45:28,200
There is no pope.

1246
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:29,990
Tempe Sede Vacante

1247
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:32,250
The Camerlengo.

1248
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:36,920
- We have to warn him. - Take a step back, please.

1249
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:40,590
Take your cell phone from your pocket.

1250
01:45:43,550 --> 01:45:45,350
Throw it in the fire.

1251
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:57,770
Murderer.

1252
01:45:57,770 --> 01:46:00,560
You know, when they call me...

1253
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,240
...and they all call me...

1254
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:05,030
it is so important to them that

1255
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:07,940
I know that I know that what they ask is the Lord's will.

1256
01:46:07,940 --> 01:46:11,290
Or Allah's, Or Yahweh's.

1257
01:46:12,410 --> 01:46:14,630
And I suppose they're right.

1258
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:20,800
Because if he was not vengeful,

1259
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,680
I would not exist, now, would I?

1260
01:46:23,170 --> 01:46:25,920
I've had several chances to eliminate you tonight.

1261
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,300
You're still alive because you have no weapon.

1262
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:29,560
...And they didn't ask me to kill you,

1263
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:31,550
But if you pursue me...

1264
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:33,980
...it is another matter.

1265
01:46:40,390 --> 01:46:41,990
Be careful.

1266
01:46:42,270 --> 01:46:44,700
These are men of God.

1267
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:58,950
The Camerlengo.

1268
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:21,850
- Camerlengo will grant you audience. - Good.

1269
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:24,140
I'd like to see him alone.

1270
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:26,960
That's impossible sir.

1271
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:29,060
No one sees the camerlengo alone.

1272
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:31,570
Have you forgotten who you're working for?

1273
01:47:33,060 --> 01:47:34,820
No, sir.

1274
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,390
Have you come to make me a martyr?

1275
01:48:08,340 --> 01:48:11,230
Here. Here. Here.

1276
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:40,270
- I need to see the Camerlengo. - He is not available.

1277
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:43,490
- I demand to see the Camerlengo. - He is not available.

1278
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:45,950
We'll see about that.

1279
01:49:55,070 --> 01:49:58,120
All locked up. Senza chiave. It's a one way portal.

1280
01:49:58,120 --> 01:50:00,540
The only entrance is on the other side.

1281
01:50:00,540 --> 01:50:03,420
No. Hey!

1282
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:08,930
I don't care who he talks to. He doesn't go into that room.

1283
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:14,140
This is Robert Langdon and Dr. Vetra. Open the door!

1284
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:17,270
Open up!

1285
01:50:20,850 --> 01:50:22,430
Open the door!

1286
01:50:22,430 --> 01:50:24,360
Hey!

1287
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:29,700
The Camerlengo is in danger.

1288
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:45,300
He's the one. He's got a gun.

1289
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:51,380
- Illuminatus! - You bastard.

1290
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:54,350
- Illuminatus! - Sanctimonious bastard!

1291
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,270
Order the evacuation.

1292
01:51:05,270 --> 01:51:07,360
We only have 19 minutes

1293
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:13,320
Here. He's...

1294
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:15,490
get the helicopter for the older cardinals.

1295
01:51:15,490 --> 01:51:17,160
Yes, sir.

1296
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:31,380
Robert?

1297
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:33,260
The brand, the symbol,

1298
01:51:33,260 --> 01:51:34,970
could it have another meaning?

1299
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:43,730
Crossed keys, but those were upside down.

1300
01:51:44,060 --> 01:51:45,860
St. Peter.

1301
01:51:46,770 --> 01:51:48,820
The first pope...

1302
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:51,270
...was crucified upside down.

1303
01:51:51,270 --> 01:51:53,980
- On Vatican Hill. - A few hundred feet below us.

1304
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:55,490
Necropolis. City of the dead.

1305
01:51:55,490 --> 01:51:58,070
"Upon this rock, I will build my church."

1306
01:51:58,070 --> 01:52:01,250
"Or bring it down upon itself."

1307
01:52:01,830 --> 01:52:05,130
The bomb. It's in St. Peter's tomb.

1308
01:52:20,010 --> 01:52:21,680
The grid is still cycling.

1309
01:52:21,680 --> 01:52:24,360
The power to this section must be down.

1310
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:25,540
It must be here. It must be.

1311
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:38,780
Don't touch it.

1312
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:41,990
We have seven minutes.

1313
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:49,790
Robert, hold this.

1314
01:54:30,570 --> 01:54:32,740
It's cold down here, isn't it?

1315
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:34,370
What's wrong?

1316
01:54:34,660 --> 01:54:37,330
Cold decreases battery life

1317
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:41,300
We may have less than five minutes.

1318
01:54:41,660 --> 01:54:43,170
So?

1319
01:54:43,170 --> 01:54:45,920
If I pull the power with less than five minutes...

1320
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:48,760
...the residual charge won't hold suspension.

1321
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:53,470
We should leave it here and get clear if we can.

1322
01:54:53,470 --> 01:54:55,850
- At least down here the damage- - No!

1323
01:54:55,850 --> 01:54:58,310
- No. Wait! - Father!

1324
01:55:00,430 --> 01:55:02,520
We are live here at St. Peter's Square...

1325
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:06,190
where, despite a bomb threat, and an order of evacuation...

1326
01:55:06,190 --> 01:55:09,940
...the crowd is actually growing in size As we await an official...

1327
01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:12,030
...announcement from the Vatican spokesman...

1328
01:55:12,030 --> 01:55:14,200
...as to the exact nature of the threat...

1329
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:18,080
...and whether or not they are treating it as a credible danger.

1330
01:55:25,420 --> 01:55:26,930
This way.

1331
01:55:59,450 --> 01:56:01,670
A bomb?

1332
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:10,220
Roberto, this is an emergency. I'll take her up alone.

1333
01:56:14,010 --> 01:56:16,060
He's got clearance.

1334
01:56:40,990 --> 01:56:43,210
Oh, my God.

1335
01:58:44,450 --> 01:58:46,120
Get down!

1336
02:01:38,620 --> 02:01:41,000
Cardinal Strauss?

1337
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:45,090
It was the Camerlengo. He has saved us all.

1338
02:01:45,090 --> 02:01:49,350
He has saved the Church and he's still alive.

1339
02:01:50,010 --> 02:01:51,890
Praise God. Praise God.

1340
02:01:57,350 --> 02:01:58,930
He is alive.

1341
02:01:58,930 --> 02:02:02,740
He sacrificed himself for all of us.

1342
02:02:30,510 --> 02:02:34,640
You know the worst thing we thought would happen?

1343
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:38,940
Was that our work would fall into the hands of the energy companies.

1344
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:43,450
We thought we could change the world.

1345
02:02:43,690 --> 02:02:45,060
So naive.

1346
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:48,860
No, not naive.

1347
02:02:48,860 --> 02:02:50,860
Innocent, maybe.

1348
02:02:50,860 --> 02:02:53,460
But it's not a crime.

1349
02:02:54,530 --> 02:02:56,960
I'm not so sure.

1350
02:02:58,240 --> 02:03:01,050
Go back to work.

1351
02:03:01,660 --> 02:03:04,050
Change the world.

1352
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:25,900
A gift, uh, you understand?

1353
02:03:25,900 --> 02:03:28,900
Let's say for Catholics everywhere.

1354
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:32,650
The Carmerlengo's age shouldn't reach the decision.

1355
02:03:32,650 --> 02:03:35,030
Signori

1356
02:03:35,030 --> 02:03:38,870
you are no doubt aware that the Holy Law of that man is ineligible for election to the papacy.

1357
02:03:38,870 --> 02:03:40,910
He's not a cardinal. He's a priest.

1358
02:03:40,910 --> 02:03:42,790
He's of insufficient age.

1359
02:03:42,790 --> 02:03:46,080
Or maybe there's a way we could consider the possibility.

1360
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:50,880
I am sorry. The protocols of conclave are not subject to modification.

1361
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:52,970
I will not call a ballot on this matter.

1362
02:03:52,970 --> 02:03:55,970
But, signore, you would not hold a ballot.

1363
02:03:55,970 --> 02:03:57,430
Surely, you remember?

1364
02:03:57,430 --> 02:04:00,390
You gave up your post as Great Elector.

1365
02:04:00,390 --> 02:04:02,720
They are singing at St. Peter's Square.

1366
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:05,600
Now, what happened here tonight transcends our laws.

1367
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:06,810
Has it?

1368
02:04:06,810 --> 02:04:10,110
Is it God's will that we give ourselves over to frenzy?

1369
02:04:10,110 --> 02:04:11,900
Discard the rules of the Church?

1370
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:14,790
Perhaps we need not discard them.

1371
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:21,370
Signori, I am thinking now of Romano Pontifici Eligendo numero 60...

1372
02:04:21,370 --> 02:04:23,460
- Acclamation by Adoration. - Exactly, signore. Exactly.

1373
02:04:24,580 --> 02:04:27,830
Yes. If the Holy Spirit speaks through us...

1374
02:04:27,830 --> 02:04:30,380
and we call a man's name out loud...

1375
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:33,170
That is election by adoration.

1376
02:04:33,170 --> 02:04:35,760
He's God's choice.

1377
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:40,930
Yes. And the candidate need only be an ordained member of the clergy...

1378
02:04:40,930 --> 02:04:45,940
present in the Sistine Chapel at the moment of his election.

1379
02:04:53,690 --> 02:04:55,490
I think we haven't certain...

1380
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:20,390
Signor Camerlengo?

1381
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:21,930
Yes?

1382
02:05:21,930 --> 02:05:26,140
The cardinals ask you to join them in conclave as soon as possible.

1383
02:05:26,140 --> 02:05:27,520
Me?

1384
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:29,900
Yes, Padre.

1385
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:53,500
What are you doing?

1386
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:56,890
Silvano's journals. I want them back.

1387
02:06:21,030 --> 02:06:23,330
Richter said...

1388
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:26,370
His Holiness suffered from seizures...

1389
02:06:26,370 --> 02:06:29,000
and steps were taken...

1390
02:06:29,830 --> 02:06:31,800
for safety.

1391
02:06:35,880 --> 02:06:39,180
He made sure he was watched he said.

1392
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:44,350
What if he were trying to give me this key?

1393
02:06:44,720 --> 02:06:47,260
That's the Papal office.

1394
02:06:47,260 --> 02:06:49,310
If the Pope was worried about seizures,

1395
02:06:49,310 --> 02:06:52,560
he must've had Richter install cameras without telling anyone.

1396
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:55,530
To keep an eye on him for his safety.

1397
02:06:57,070 --> 02:06:59,120
Maybe it records.

1398
02:07:09,830 --> 02:07:11,710
I read the journals, Patrick.

1399
02:07:11,710 --> 02:07:14,460
The scientist kept journals. So?

1400
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:16,470
You figure prominently in them.

1401
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:18,090
Really?

1402
02:07:18,090 --> 02:07:22,810
The Devoli wasn't just a physicist. He was also a Catholic priest.

1403
02:07:23,090 --> 02:07:27,260
As such, he was deeply conflicted about the implications of his work

1404
02:07:27,260 --> 02:07:29,930
and in need of spiritual guidance.

1405
02:07:29,930 --> 02:07:32,070
Like Galileo.

1406
02:07:32,730 --> 02:07:36,150
About a month ago... he requested an audience with the Pope.

1407
02:07:36,150 --> 02:07:38,020
But you know that.

1408
02:07:38,020 --> 02:07:41,440
You soon granted the audience and you were also present during it.

1409
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:44,610
The 'God Particle'.

1410
02:07:44,610 --> 02:07:46,620
To actually claim an act of creation. The blasphemy. The arrogance.

1411
02:07:46,620 --> 02:07:49,370
The Holy Father didn't see it like that.

1412
02:07:49,370 --> 02:07:51,450
He urged him to go public.

1413
02:07:51,450 --> 02:07:53,540
His Holiness thought that the discovery

1414
02:07:53,540 --> 02:07:57,750
could actually scientifically prove the existence of a divine power.

1415
02:07:57,750 --> 02:08:00,920
And begin to bridge the gap between science and religion.

1416
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:03,800
His work was not religious. It was sacrilegious.

1417
02:08:03,800 --> 02:08:08,980
But you... You saw the pope's position as a softening of church law.

1418
02:08:09,470 --> 02:08:13,400
As an old man's weakness. Your father's weakness.

1419
02:08:13,770 --> 02:08:15,600
Your father's weakness.

1420
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:19,650
He raised me to protect this Church... even from within.

1421
02:08:19,650 --> 02:08:23,950
Then you conjured up an old enemy from the past. The Illuminati.

1422
02:08:25,820 --> 02:08:30,120
You found the ancient brands in the papal vaults and put them to use...

1423
02:08:30,120 --> 02:08:31,330
to spread fear!

1424
02:08:31,330 --> 02:08:33,910
The Cardinals are men of belief.

1425
02:08:33,910 --> 02:08:37,580
Right now, their belief in evil is uniting them.

1426
02:08:37,580 --> 02:08:40,920
The entire Catholic world will be united by this attack.

1427
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:43,140
There is no attack.

1428
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:46,800
You're trying to convince the Cardinals they're in a war...

1429
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:49,050
so they will choose a warrior to lead them.

1430
02:08:49,050 --> 02:08:50,350
We are at war.

1431
02:08:50,350 --> 02:08:52,470
We're weak when we should be strong.

1432
02:08:52,470 --> 02:08:56,480
If science is allowed to claim the power of creation...

1433
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:58,350
what is left for God?

1434
02:08:58,350 --> 02:09:00,320
It didn't work, Patrick.

1435
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:05,200
- It isn't finished. - Oh, yes, it's finished.

1436
02:09:06,110 --> 02:09:08,330
It's finished.

1437
02:09:09,030 --> 02:09:12,030
I've shown the journals to Father Simeon.

1438
02:09:12,030 --> 02:09:14,490
The moment the doors to the Conclave open...

1439
02:09:14,490 --> 02:09:17,710
he will tell the Cardinals what you've done.

1440
02:09:17,960 --> 02:09:20,760
I was planning on doing this alone.

1441
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:25,100
Put it down.

1442
02:09:27,470 --> 02:09:30,390
But, perhaps, it's better that you're here.

1443
02:09:30,390 --> 02:09:31,810
Put it down.

1444
02:09:33,350 --> 02:09:35,440
Put it away.

1445
02:09:47,490 --> 02:09:50,790
Help. He's the one. He's got a gun.

1446
02:09:54,330 --> 02:09:56,750
- Illuminatus. - You bastard.

1447
02:09:56,750 --> 02:09:59,590
- Illuminatus! - You bastard!

1448
02:10:03,600 --> 02:10:05,650
Padre.

1449
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:17,980
And get the helicopter for the older cardinals, right?

1450
02:11:08,940 --> 02:11:12,200
I've been summoned by the College of Cardinals.

1451
02:12:25,350 --> 02:12:26,810
Gently.

1452
02:12:26,810 --> 02:12:31,350
But within our walls.

1453
02:12:40,940 --> 02:12:43,130
He's on your side.

1454
02:13:32,060 --> 02:13:36,080
Father, into their hands I commend my spirit.

1455
02:14:29,490 --> 02:14:31,330
Church sources now confirm that

1456
02:14:31,330 --> 02:14:33,750
Carmelengo, Father Patrick McKenna

1457
02:14:33,750 --> 02:14:38,710
has died of internal injuries sustained in his heroic fall...

1458
02:14:38,710 --> 02:14:41,000
The Catholic church thanks Camerlengo

1459
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:45,170
for his selfless act and demands his immediate canonization.

1460
02:14:45,170 --> 02:14:49,010
The Vatican has also confirmed the deaths of three Cardinals

1461
02:14:49,010 --> 02:14:51,680
and the fire in the Santa Maria della Vittoria.

1462
02:14:51,680 --> 02:14:54,350
As we await the appearance of the new Holy Father

1463
02:14:54,350 --> 02:14:56,140
Cardinal Baggia of Italy...

1464
02:14:56,140 --> 02:14:59,900
one of the four original Preferiti...

1465
02:14:59,900 --> 02:15:02,230
who, despite terrorist attempts at disruption...

1466
02:15:02,230 --> 02:15:04,820
seems to have been selected in one of the swiftest and smoothest conclaves

1467
02:15:04,820 --> 02:15:06,910
in modern church history.

1468
02:15:13,580 --> 02:15:15,800
Professor Langdon? Please.

1469
02:15:32,930 --> 02:15:36,430
A token of thanks from His Holiness...

1470
02:15:36,430 --> 02:15:39,820
and from his new Camerlengo.

1471
02:15:40,770 --> 02:15:43,730
We are grateful you saved his life.

1472
02:15:43,730 --> 02:15:47,150
And it's our understanding that you require this text...

1473
02:15:47,150 --> 02:15:49,500
to complete your scholary work.

1474
02:15:51,240 --> 02:15:54,530
We ask only that in your last grand testament...

1475
02:15:54,530 --> 02:15:56,990
you ensure

1476
02:15:56,990 --> 02:15:59,210
it finds its way home.

1477
02:16:01,670 --> 02:16:02,920
Of course.

1478
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:05,290
And when you write of us...

1479
02:16:05,290 --> 02:16:08,260
and you will write of us...

1480
02:16:08,260 --> 02:16:10,720
may I ask one thing?

1481
02:16:10,720 --> 02:16:12,600
Do so gently.

1482
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:16,470
I'll try.

1483
02:16:16,470 --> 02:16:18,610
Religion is flawed...

1484
02:16:18,980 --> 02:16:21,980
but only because man is flawed.

1485
02:16:21,980 --> 02:16:25,700
All men, including this one.

1486
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,130
He chose the name Luke.

1487
02:16:44,790 --> 02:16:47,800
There's been many Marks and Johns.

1488
02:16:49,170 --> 02:16:51,060
Never a Luke.

1489
02:16:51,470 --> 02:16:53,140
It said he was a doctor.

1490
02:16:54,180 --> 02:16:58,350
It's quite a message. Science and faith, all in one.

1491
02:16:58,350 --> 02:17:00,270
The world is in need of both.

1492
02:17:02,850 --> 02:17:05,570
You'll counsel him wisely.

1493
02:17:05,610 --> 02:17:09,490
I'm an old man. I'll counsel him briefly.

1494
02:17:14,820 --> 02:17:17,170
Mr. Langdon.

1495
02:17:22,040 --> 02:17:26,970
Thanks be to God for sending someone to protect this church.

1496
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:33,720
I don't believe He sent me, Father.

1497
02:17:33,720 --> 02:17:36,180
Oh, my son.

1498
02:17:36,180 --> 02:17:38,520
Of course He did.
