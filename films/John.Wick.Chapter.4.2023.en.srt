1
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:04,131
"I am the way
into the city of woe.

2
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:13,708
"I am the way into eternal pain.

3
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:17,277
"I am the way
to go among the lost.

4
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:21,883
"Before me, there were
no created things.

5
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,319
"But those that last forever.

6
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:30,825
"As do I!

7
00:01:30,892 --> 00:01:35,262
"Abandon all hope
you who are about to
enter here."

8
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:42,202
You are now in the presence

9
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,673
of the motherfuckin' king!

10
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,427
You ready, John?

11
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:14,869
Yeah.

12
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:58,546
Move! John Wick!

13
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,392
Mr. Wick.

14
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:23,296
To what do I
owe the pleasure?

15
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,339
My ring.

16
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,442
My freedom.

17
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,114
Your ring is gone,

18
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:41,916
like The Elder
before me.

19
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,153
And if you
came here thinking

20
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:47,255
you could end this
by killing me,

21
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,023
then you
are mistaken.

22
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,959
My death will not
change the outcome

23
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:54,962
any more than you can
change your nature.

24
00:04:55,997 --> 00:04:59,432
None of us
can escape who we are,

25
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,302
and no one
escapes The Table.

26
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,540
And the only way John Wick

27
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:09,342
will ever have freedom
or peace, now or ever,

28
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,712
is in death.

29
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,550
I know.

30
00:05:18,653 --> 00:05:21,989
I'm afraid you've come
a very long way

31
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:23,891
for nothing.

32
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:27,394
Yeah...

33
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,067
Not really.

34
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,786
The Manager, please.

35
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:38,933
A Harbinger is here
to see you, sir.

36
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:41,869
This must
be a mistake.

37
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:43,738
There is no mistake.

38
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,306
By order
of the Marquis,

39
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:47,808
Vincent Bisset
de Gramont,

40
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,877
this hotel
has been condemned.

41
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:03,958
You have one hour.

42
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,171
He is
expecting you.

43
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:24,946
Can they do this, sir?

44
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:28,182
The decree is signed
by the 12 members of The Table,

45
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:31,352
giving the Marquis

46
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:33,154
the power of <i>autem imperator,</i>

47
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,992
which means he is
now our judge, jury and...

48
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:42,730
Evacuate the hotel.

49
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:03,317
Ned Kelly's final words
as the hangman slipped

50
00:08:03,384 --> 00:08:05,485
the noose
around his neck were...

51
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:08,022
"Such is life."

52
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,489
"Such is life."

53
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:12,693
Can you imagine
the acceptance,
the defiance?

54
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,495
Today is not the day
you will die.

55
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:18,065
Of that,
I am sure.

56
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:21,502
You have
the unshakeable faith
of David, my friend,

57
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:23,571
but you shouldn't be here.

58
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:26,140
This will not be pleasant.

59
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:29,744
Such is life, sir.

60
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,707
My father used to say,

61
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:02,543
"How you do anything

62
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,679
"is how you do everything."

63
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:09,016
Called it the first
and the last rule of life.

64
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,288
You believe in rules...

65
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:18,993
Mr. Manager?

66
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:22,129
Oh, I do.

67
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,766
And what
of consequences?

68
00:09:27,536 --> 00:09:28,769
Of course.

69
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,274
And second chances.

70
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,111
Ah. That's where we differ,

71
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:38,245
you and I.

72
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:43,617
Second chances

73
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:46,921
are the refuge of men who fail.

74
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,587
Mm.

75
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,056
There are those on The Table

76
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:24,593
who blame this, um,

77
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:27,194
atrocity on New York.

78
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,798
They believe
it's this city.

79
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,402
The Table has indulged this

80
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,037
fucking place for too long.

81
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:40,107
And look where
that has gotten us.

82
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,346
I shot him.

83
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:47,715
And yet he lives,

84
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,384
polluting everything he touches.

85
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:53,220
Marquis,
respectfully,
my hotel...

86
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:54,855
Your hotel?

87
00:10:56,891 --> 00:10:59,793
If I might, sir?

88
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:08,969
By all means.

89
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:14,875
The Continentals
and their management

90
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,646
are a reminder

91
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:19,614
to all who sit
beneath The Table

92
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,983
that none of us
are above the rules.

93
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:27,188
And yet we are here.

94
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,190
Sir, Mr. Wick...

95
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:31,725
We're not here
because of John Wick!

96
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:39,366
He is simply the face
of your failure, Mr. Manager.

97
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:46,006
The sand in that glass

98
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:50,211
is merely an echo
of my remaining patience.

99
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:22,142
You are no longer New York.

100
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:26,914
You are nothing.

101
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,385
You are Excommunicado.

102
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:34,522
And as such...

103
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:40,461
you no longer need
the services
of a concierge.

104
00:13:06,755 --> 00:13:09,390
It has been an honor,

105
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:11,892
my friend.

106
00:13:21,736 --> 00:13:23,103
It should have been me.

107
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,273
Yes.

108
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,576
But it wasn't.

109
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:31,412
Now, you think about
why that is,

110
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,082
and perhaps one of us
will have benefited
from this conversation.

111
00:15:09,176 --> 00:15:10,578
I have a name for you.

112
00:15:11,513 --> 00:15:12,913
Respectfully,

113
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,015
I'm retired.

114
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,151
Finished. Done.

115
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,154
I disagree.

116
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:22,624
I'm no use to you.

117
00:15:24,526 --> 00:15:25,959
Or The Table.

118
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:29,430
That's not
for you to decide.

119
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:37,438
I think you should
find someone else.

120
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:43,477
You came close.

121
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,180
Today.

122
00:15:46,848 --> 00:15:48,215
Too close.

123
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:50,150
You put her in danger.

124
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,532
I know the deal I made.

125
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,046
A former associate, I believe.

126
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,284
He was.

127
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,223
And a friend.

128
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:33,393
Hmm.

129
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:39,066
The agreement
with The Table
stays the same.

130
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,970
We give you a name,

131
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,303
you give us a life.

132
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:44,772
Or...

133
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,241
we take one.

134
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:09,429
I will serve.

135
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,266
I will be
of service.

136
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,204
Excellent!

137
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:24,546
I assume you
have a notion of
where he might be?

138
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:31,418
John Wick has
few friends remaining
in the world,

139
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,221
and even fewer he trusts

140
00:17:35,023 --> 00:17:36,256
with his life.

141
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,095
Very, very good.

142
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:35,248
Welcome to
the Osaka Continental.
How can I help?

143
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:36,684
Yeah, I'm lookin'
for a room.

144
00:18:40,655 --> 00:18:43,290
I'm afraid this facility
doesn't allow animals.

145
00:18:45,093 --> 00:18:46,628
Emotional support animal.

146
00:18:46,694 --> 00:18:48,563
She's your
support animal?
Other way round.

147
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,532
I'm hers.
Isn't that right?

148
00:18:57,038 --> 00:18:58,338
She stays in your room.

149
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,578
Enjoy
your stay, sir.

150
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:14,522
It's not too bad.

151
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:16,958
Not bad at all.

152
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,574
There is a dog
in my lobby.

153
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:35,175
Emotional
support animal.

154
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,244
Of course it is.

155
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,747
Tomorrow's schedule.
Mr. Suzuki at 11:00

156
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:42,349
and the Tarasovs
are requesting
an audience at 2:00.

157
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,251
What's this at 8:00?

158
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:45,553
Dinner with
your daughter.

159
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,721
She says
she's concerned
you've been

160
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:48,255
working too hard.

161
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:51,224
What must I have done
to deserve

162
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,695
such a considerate child?

163
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:57,031
Good karma,
I suppose.
Indeed.

164
00:19:57,098 --> 00:19:59,634
And how are our guests?

165
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:03,137
Some of
our gold club members
are anxious.

166
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,173
It's always something.

167
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:07,141
And today
it's New York.

168
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,643
And my concierge?

169
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,645
Concerned.

170
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:14,214
Perhaps we should
get you an emotional
support animal.

171
00:20:20,922 --> 00:20:23,057
We've done nothing
to offend The Table.

172
00:20:23,124 --> 00:20:24,959
Your relationship with Mr. Wick
is no secret.

173
00:20:25,026 --> 00:20:27,995
The Table will come.

174
00:20:28,062 --> 00:20:29,964
And...

175
00:20:31,199 --> 00:20:33,968
...will be met
with our grace.

176
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:35,603
Everything he touches dies.

177
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,480
Forgive me, Father.

178
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:52,285
Akira.

179
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:57,290
Please tell my daughter

180
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:59,326
that I look forward
to our dinner.

181
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:05,425
Apparently not.

182
00:22:06,694 --> 00:22:09,462
Killing the Elder
was a mistake, my friend.

183
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:16,971
Their response
was the destruction of
the New York Continental.

184
00:22:18,773 --> 00:22:20,942
My daughter fears
we are next.

185
00:22:22,243 --> 00:22:23,511
Winston?

186
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:27,114
Alive, but they executed
his concierge

187
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:29,884
to prove a point.

188
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,397
Have you given
any thought to

189
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:46,466
where this ends?

190
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:53,841
The Table
will never stop.

191
00:22:55,877 --> 00:22:56,878
You know this.

192
00:23:01,015 --> 00:23:02,783
It only takes life

193
00:23:03,718 --> 00:23:05,753
and only gives death.

194
00:23:11,993 --> 00:23:13,027
Koji...

195
00:23:22,937 --> 00:23:26,140
Friendship means little
when it's convenient.

196
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,960
Welcome to
the Osaka Continental.
How can I help?

197
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:20,127
The manager.

198
00:24:22,697 --> 00:24:23,931
<i>Por favor.</i>

199
00:24:27,168 --> 00:24:29,103
Of course.

200
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,805
Please, make
yourself comfortable.

201
00:24:41,382 --> 00:24:44,585
The only path
this leads to is death.

202
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:50,091
I'm going
to kill them all.

203
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:52,960
I believe you'll try.

204
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:54,996
But no one,

205
00:24:55,062 --> 00:24:57,798
not even you,
can kill everyone.

206
00:25:00,568 --> 00:25:01,802
You want to die?

207
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,971
That's your choice.

208
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:06,741
A good death

209
00:25:07,742 --> 00:25:10,111
only comes after a good life.

210
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:13,614
You and I left
a good life behind

211
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:15,916
a long time ago, my friend.

212
00:25:21,122 --> 00:25:22,890
Father, The High Table.

213
00:25:24,658 --> 00:25:25,993
What is he doing here?

214
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,129
Mr. Wick
is our guest.

215
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,531
Father...

216
00:25:30,598 --> 00:25:32,967
I'll talk to them.
They don't know
you're here.

217
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:35,770
Stay with Mr. Wick.

218
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:49,550
<i>Hai.</i>

219
00:26:15,142 --> 00:26:18,112
Welcome
to the Osaka Continental,
gentlemen.

220
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:22,049
How may I be
of service?

221
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:23,751
The Table has
reason to believe

222
00:26:23,818 --> 00:26:27,121
that this facility
is providing services...

223
00:26:31,692 --> 00:26:34,695
That is
a grave accusation.

224
00:26:34,762 --> 00:26:37,598
We will require
full access
to your hotel.

225
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,668
Of course.

226
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:42,369
But as you
are well aware,

227
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:44,205
no business,

228
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:45,906
not even your kind
of business,

229
00:26:45,973 --> 00:26:49,511
may be conducted
on Continental grounds.

230
00:26:49,578 --> 00:26:52,046
So, I'm going
to have to ask you

231
00:26:52,113 --> 00:26:54,648
to surrender your firearms.

232
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:58,520
We speak for the Marquis.

233
00:26:58,587 --> 00:27:00,654
And I speak
for Osaka.

234
00:27:01,255 --> 00:27:02,289
Your guns,

235
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,091
please.

236
00:27:05,993 --> 00:27:09,864
Don't repeat the mistake
that fool in New York made.

237
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,900
Fools talk,
cowards are silent,

238
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:15,703
but wise men listen.

239
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:17,671
So which one
will you be?

240
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:30,417
Hello, old friend.

241
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:37,024
So good of you to visit
after all these years.

242
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:40,294
You are
with them now?
No.

243
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,899
No.
Your daughter?

244
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:46,901
Mia?

245
00:27:48,503 --> 00:27:49,703
Alive.

246
00:27:51,372 --> 00:27:52,773
And your daughter Akira?

247
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:55,910
Well.

248
00:27:57,646 --> 00:27:58,846
I'm glad.

249
00:28:01,448 --> 00:28:02,683
You know...

250
00:28:04,653 --> 00:28:06,787
we don't have
to end this with blood.

251
00:28:08,657 --> 00:28:10,424
Then leave.

252
00:28:10,491 --> 00:28:11,892
No one defies The Table.

253
00:28:11,959 --> 00:28:14,495
I remember once
you understood that.

254
00:28:14,563 --> 00:28:16,063
And I remember a time

255
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,966
when you understood
the meaning of brotherhood.

256
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:20,635
Enough!

257
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:22,637
By order of
the Marquis de Gramont,

258
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:25,139
this hotel has
been deconsecrated.

259
00:28:26,173 --> 00:28:27,408
Step aside.

260
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,925
Don't do this, Koji.

261
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:56,036
I'm sorry.

262
00:30:15,517 --> 00:30:16,584
Get out.

263
00:30:41,075 --> 00:30:42,711
Secure the hotel.

264
00:30:42,777 --> 00:30:44,044
Find Wick.

265
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:53,521
If they find you here,

266
00:30:53,588 --> 00:30:56,490
The Table will
kill my father, me,

267
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:00,094
everyone, because
you broke the rules.

268
00:31:01,663 --> 00:31:03,097
You shouldn't have come.

269
00:31:27,589 --> 00:31:28,590
You armed?

270
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:40,562
<i>Hai.</i>

271
00:33:34,983 --> 00:33:36,651
Hey!

272
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:38,252
Blind man!

273
00:33:38,318 --> 00:33:40,320
Do your job!

274
00:37:53,406 --> 00:37:54,742
Akira!

275
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:14,796
Get out the way
you came.

276
00:38:14,862 --> 00:38:17,265
Go to
the Umeda Station.
I'll stay.

277
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,801
Don't insult
my gift to you.

278
00:38:22,537 --> 00:38:25,540
And, John, do me
a small courtesy.

279
00:43:48,162 --> 00:43:49,196
John?

280
00:43:50,565 --> 00:43:51,765
Caine.

281
00:44:00,774 --> 00:44:02,743
They gave you
my name.

282
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,248
Yeah.

283
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:11,886
I'm sorry.

284
00:44:14,221 --> 00:44:15,256
Me, too.

285
00:44:37,077 --> 00:44:38,946
You should have
stayed out.

286
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:42,349
For all our sakes.

287
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,286
I tried.

288
00:44:47,254 --> 00:44:48,355
Did you?

289
00:45:22,923 --> 00:45:24,225
Come on, John.

290
00:45:26,994 --> 00:45:28,362
Let's get this shit
over with.

291
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:33,901
Yeah.

292
00:45:33,968 --> 00:45:36,203
That sounds
like a good idea.

293
00:45:52,786 --> 00:45:54,288
You took a deal.

294
00:45:56,558 --> 00:45:57,958
Same as you, John.

295
00:46:01,663 --> 00:46:02,863
Family?

296
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:07,768
Family.

297
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,399
You dead, John?

298
00:47:15,737 --> 00:47:16,970
John.

299
00:47:17,672 --> 00:47:19,039
Caine.

300
00:47:57,211 --> 00:48:01,148
John Wick, open...

301
00:48:01,215 --> 00:48:05,553
John Wick...

302
00:49:10,919 --> 00:49:12,720
Damn, Johnny.

303
00:49:12,787 --> 00:49:15,222
This is
quite the mess
you've made.

304
00:49:15,824 --> 00:49:17,592
I don't know you.

305
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:18,726
But I know you.

306
00:49:26,568 --> 00:49:28,135
You a tracker?

307
00:49:33,775 --> 00:49:35,042
How much?

308
00:49:38,212 --> 00:49:39,581
Not enough.

309
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:43,551
But it's gettin' there.

310
00:49:49,557 --> 00:49:51,992
I need you
to take better care
of yourself, Johnny.

311
00:49:54,261 --> 00:49:56,196
'Cause we're
in this together now.

312
00:50:40,808 --> 00:50:42,209
All right, Koji.

313
00:50:46,413 --> 00:50:49,349
Just tell me where John is
and get out of here.

314
00:50:50,752 --> 00:50:51,819
Leave.

315
00:50:52,921 --> 00:50:55,489
Go somewhere far away.

316
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:58,793
You know I won't.

317
00:51:28,155 --> 00:51:29,857
You owe John Wick nothing.

318
00:51:32,894 --> 00:51:35,228
He has no marker on you.

319
00:51:41,268 --> 00:51:44,338
You must
have fallen far
to believe

320
00:51:44,404 --> 00:51:46,340
the only debts we have...

321
00:51:48,009 --> 00:51:49,811
...lie in markers.

322
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,552
Come on.

323
00:51:59,988 --> 00:52:01,623
I don't want to do this.

324
00:52:47,902 --> 00:52:49,169
Father!

325
00:53:04,819 --> 00:53:05,920
Look at me.

326
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:16,664
Even a blind man knows
you have lost.

327
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,333
And, Caine,

328
00:53:21,903 --> 00:53:25,606
you don't need eyes
to see the right path.

329
00:53:29,276 --> 00:53:30,945
Just take care
of your daughter.

330
00:53:33,313 --> 00:53:34,649
I...

331
00:53:37,785 --> 00:53:38,820
I am.

332
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,427
No!

333
00:54:24,364 --> 00:54:25,700
Don't.

334
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:29,469
Live.

335
00:54:51,526 --> 00:54:53,293
I'll be waiting for you.

336
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,134
Who is he?

337
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,877
He was a friend.

338
00:56:17,845 --> 00:56:20,147
My father is dead
because of you.

339
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,086
Because of what you did.

340
00:56:28,723 --> 00:56:30,925
So either you kill him...

341
00:56:33,094 --> 00:56:34,427
or I will.

342
00:56:41,535 --> 00:56:43,403
I understand.

343
00:57:03,524 --> 00:57:06,861
Goodbye, Mr. Wick.

344
00:57:30,017 --> 00:57:31,185
Thanks for coming.

345
00:57:32,687 --> 00:57:34,388
Well, us homeless folk
do have to

346
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:36,456
stick together now,
don't we?

347
00:57:40,728 --> 00:57:43,531
I need to speak
to him.

348
00:57:45,433 --> 00:57:47,868
Last time
you spoke to him,

349
00:57:47,935 --> 00:57:50,871
you shot him
off a roof.

350
00:57:50,938 --> 00:57:52,840
I had no choice.

351
00:57:52,907 --> 00:57:54,709
They held
all the cards.

352
00:57:55,176 --> 00:57:56,476
No.

353
00:57:57,278 --> 00:57:59,013
But who held the gun?

354
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,649
John needs to know
the breadth of what's
coming at him.

355
00:58:01,716 --> 00:58:03,483
This Marquis
is unrestrained.

356
00:58:03,551 --> 00:58:05,453
The Table have
let him off the leash.

357
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:07,688
Oh, my dear Winston,

358
00:58:07,755 --> 00:58:10,624
your benevolence
is touching!

359
00:58:11,726 --> 00:58:14,428
But tell me.
Tell me true.

360
00:58:14,494 --> 00:58:17,131
Why did the Frenchman
let you live?

361
00:58:17,198 --> 00:58:20,101
Killing a man
can turn him
into a martyr.

362
00:58:21,235 --> 00:58:23,838
Letting him live...

363
00:58:23,904 --> 00:58:27,174
tells the world
he's a coward
or a turncoat.

364
00:58:30,745 --> 00:58:32,546
So what are you?

365
00:58:34,515 --> 00:58:36,050
Aggrieved.

366
00:58:57,872 --> 00:59:01,208
I fail to see
how laying waste
to Continentals

367
00:59:01,275 --> 00:59:04,712
is getting you closer
to killing John Wick.

368
00:59:04,779 --> 00:59:08,015
This campaign
is not to kill John Wick.

369
00:59:08,082 --> 00:59:10,951
It is to kill
the idea
of John Wick.

370
00:59:11,852 --> 00:59:13,788
And to do that,
I must

371
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:16,657
destroy everything
that idea touches.

372
00:59:21,729 --> 00:59:23,664
The bloodshed
in Osaka

373
00:59:23,731 --> 00:59:25,199
was not necessary.

374
00:59:26,767 --> 00:59:29,837
The bloodshed
was the point.

375
00:59:45,653 --> 00:59:47,588
He'll make it
your choice.

376
00:59:55,362 --> 00:59:57,231
You, come with me.

377
00:59:58,766 --> 01:00:01,001
Think twice
before accepting.

378
01:00:07,576 --> 01:00:08,776
And you are?

379
01:00:09,544 --> 01:00:10,778
Nobody.

380
01:00:12,813 --> 01:00:16,551
Coyness, Mr. Nobody,

381
01:00:16,617 --> 01:00:18,252
is a pathetic trait.

382
01:00:19,687 --> 01:00:21,222
A miscalculation,

383
01:00:21,288 --> 01:00:24,658
in which by trying
to hide our ego,

384
01:00:24,725 --> 01:00:26,660
we let it appear
stark naked.

385
01:00:29,531 --> 01:00:31,332
I will ask
only once.

386
01:00:36,571 --> 01:00:38,772
How were you able
to locate him?

387
01:00:40,908 --> 01:00:42,343
Pay
and I'll tell you.

388
01:00:48,415 --> 01:00:51,485
How much would
such a service
be worth?

389
01:00:51,553 --> 01:00:52,953
Twenty-five
million,

390
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:55,823
plus a matching
contribution
to my 401k

391
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:57,091
when he's dead.

392
01:00:57,158 --> 01:00:58,259
Hmm.

393
01:01:00,728 --> 01:01:02,496
We found him once.

394
01:01:02,564 --> 01:01:03,565
We'll find him again.

395
01:01:03,632 --> 01:01:04,899
Is that before

396
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:07,067
or after he puts you
in the ground?

397
01:01:14,141 --> 01:01:15,209
I like you.

398
01:01:18,846 --> 01:01:20,314
Twenty million.

399
01:01:24,385 --> 01:01:25,786
Like me some more.

400
01:01:27,188 --> 01:01:28,289
Twenty-three.

401
01:01:29,356 --> 01:01:32,561
Ego, Mr. Nobody.
Mm.

402
01:01:32,627 --> 01:01:34,663
It's 23.

403
01:01:34,728 --> 01:01:36,430
You clearly
can afford it.

404
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:46,340
For the service.
Mm-hmm.

405
01:01:49,843 --> 01:01:51,478
Fuck!

406
01:01:53,814 --> 01:01:55,416
No, no, no.
No. It's okay.

407
01:01:55,482 --> 01:01:57,519
Hey, it's okay.
Sit. Sit.

408
01:02:00,921 --> 01:02:02,823
What the fuck
is this, man?

409
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:05,125
A choice.

410
01:02:05,192 --> 01:02:06,661
You can pull
the knife out

411
01:02:06,727 --> 01:02:09,830
or you can pull
your hand out.

412
01:02:09,897 --> 01:02:12,766
One shows me
a man committed
only to himself,

413
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:14,168
and the other,

414
01:02:14,235 --> 01:02:16,504
a man committed
to the cause.

415
01:02:17,672 --> 01:02:18,939
Which one are you?

416
01:03:53,901 --> 01:03:55,169
Winston.

417
01:03:55,836 --> 01:03:57,204
Jonathan.

418
01:03:58,939 --> 01:04:00,874
My condolences.

419
01:04:02,142 --> 01:04:03,911
He was a good man.

420
01:04:05,879 --> 01:04:07,348
Yes, he was.

421
01:04:08,115 --> 01:04:10,050
Taken for our sins.

422
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,529
Who is this?

423
01:04:22,996 --> 01:04:25,199
The Marquis de Gramont.

424
01:04:25,265 --> 01:04:28,902
Elevated only by
his guarantee
of killing you.

425
01:04:28,969 --> 01:04:32,373
All the resources
of The Table
are at his disposal.

426
01:04:33,842 --> 01:04:35,442
Where do I find him?

427
01:04:36,511 --> 01:04:37,545
Paris.

428
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:43,917
Where will it end?

429
01:04:45,486 --> 01:04:46,487
Huh?

430
01:04:47,921 --> 01:04:49,323
With him dead.

431
01:04:50,157 --> 01:04:52,159
Oh. And then?

432
01:04:53,728 --> 01:04:55,062
Hmm?

433
01:04:55,129 --> 01:04:59,366
Have you
learned nothing?

434
01:04:59,433 --> 01:05:02,871
They will replace him
before the body's cold.

435
01:05:02,936 --> 01:05:04,706
Hercules had his Hydra.

436
01:05:04,773 --> 01:05:07,174
You have The Table,
except you'll
run out of bullets

437
01:05:07,241 --> 01:05:09,243
before they
run out of heads.

438
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:17,017
Kill him, but do it
the smart way.

439
01:05:17,084 --> 01:05:19,153
And get him to give you
your freedom.

440
01:05:21,723 --> 01:05:23,190
How?

441
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:25,827
Turn his rules
and consequences
against him.

442
01:05:25,894 --> 01:05:28,362
Challenge him
to single combat.

443
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:33,300
High Table duels are a myth.

444
01:05:33,367 --> 01:05:34,736
Wrong!

445
01:05:34,803 --> 01:05:37,539
They're a cold
hard fact,

446
01:05:37,605 --> 01:05:39,774
and part of the foundation
of The Table

447
01:05:39,841 --> 01:05:43,377
to stop its more
combustible members
from outright war.

448
01:05:45,747 --> 01:05:48,148
It's also,
win or lose,

449
01:05:50,284 --> 01:05:52,186
what you say you want,

450
01:05:52,854 --> 01:05:54,388
a way out.

451
01:05:58,392 --> 01:06:00,762
I don't sit at The Table.

452
01:06:00,829 --> 01:06:03,163
Your family does.

453
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:04,965
Get them to issue
the challenge

454
01:06:05,032 --> 01:06:07,535
and then offer you up
as proxy.

455
01:06:07,602 --> 01:06:09,871
I don't have a family.

456
01:06:09,938 --> 01:06:12,439
The Ruska Roma
tore my ticket.

457
01:06:14,107 --> 01:06:18,045
Then I suggest
you get your ass
to Berlin

458
01:06:18,813 --> 01:06:20,247
and get it mended.

459
01:06:20,949 --> 01:06:22,149
Or...

460
01:06:24,652 --> 01:06:25,687
pick a plot.

461
01:06:28,288 --> 01:06:30,692
What do you get
out of this, Winston?

462
01:06:32,092 --> 01:06:34,328
What you were so good
at getting, Jonathan.

463
01:06:35,095 --> 01:06:37,130
Revenge.

464
01:07:29,984 --> 01:07:32,386
Hmm.

465
01:08:16,096 --> 01:08:17,532
Nice suit.

466
01:08:33,915 --> 01:08:35,482
Speak.

467
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:38,385
He's in Berlin,
at the Ruska Roma.

468
01:08:38,452 --> 01:08:40,788
<i>You can wire</i>
<i>that finder's fee now.</i>

469
01:08:40,855 --> 01:08:41,856
No.

470
01:08:42,657 --> 01:08:44,157
<i>Excuse me?</i>

471
01:08:44,224 --> 01:08:46,661
Kill John and you'll
get your money.

472
01:08:48,161 --> 01:08:49,897
That wasn't part of our deal.

473
01:08:51,331 --> 01:08:54,769
The deal was
for your service.

474
01:08:54,836 --> 01:08:58,438
And it's now
a life for a life,
Mr. Nobody.

475
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:03,778
<i>Yours or his.</i>

476
01:09:03,845 --> 01:09:07,347
When it's done,
you will have your prize.

477
01:09:07,414 --> 01:09:08,783
And your pension.

478
01:09:18,092 --> 01:09:19,326
Asshole.

479
01:09:51,125 --> 01:09:52,560
Jonathan Wick?

480
01:10:10,044 --> 01:10:11,411
You are forgetting

481
01:10:11,478 --> 01:10:14,414
we are still
under The Table.

482
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:17,118
And last I checked...

483
01:10:17,185 --> 01:10:19,319
...you are Excommunicado

484
01:10:19,386 --> 01:10:22,523
and your ticket
was torn.

485
01:10:23,758 --> 01:10:27,260
You have no business
with us.

486
01:10:30,164 --> 01:10:31,733
Pyotr is dead!

487
01:10:36,637 --> 01:10:38,271
After you

488
01:10:38,338 --> 01:10:40,474
put a bullet
in The Elder's head,

489
01:10:42,309 --> 01:10:44,812
the Marquis had one
put in Pyotr's.

490
01:10:45,913 --> 01:10:49,316
And in fine
Russian tradition...

491
01:10:49,382 --> 01:10:52,019
He sent us the bill.

492
01:10:53,755 --> 01:10:55,322
Because of you,

493
01:10:55,388 --> 01:10:56,791
I had to kneel

494
01:10:56,858 --> 01:10:59,761
in front of the man
who murdered my father.

495
01:10:59,827 --> 01:11:01,963
Then we have

496
01:11:02,029 --> 01:11:03,631
a common enemy.

497
01:11:04,999 --> 01:11:07,902
We can help each other.

498
01:11:07,969 --> 01:11:12,106
You can't even
help yourself.

499
01:11:12,173 --> 01:11:14,542
How the hell
are you going
to help us?

500
01:11:14,609 --> 01:11:18,445
By killing this Marquis.

501
01:11:18,513 --> 01:11:20,347
They just
appoint another.

502
01:11:24,852 --> 01:11:26,453
It does

503
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:29,456
if I kill him in a duel!

504
01:12:10,463 --> 01:12:12,365
How many did you kill

505
01:12:12,432 --> 01:12:13,534
to get out?

506
01:12:13,601 --> 01:12:15,670
A lot.

507
01:12:16,771 --> 01:12:18,806
You will only have
to kill one

508
01:12:19,372 --> 01:12:20,675
to get back in.

509
01:12:20,741 --> 01:12:23,778
The bastard who
murdered my father.

510
01:12:25,378 --> 01:12:27,949
Give me the name.

511
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:30,852
Killa Harkan.

512
01:12:30,918 --> 01:12:33,453
You will find him
at Himmel and Hölle.

513
01:12:33,521 --> 01:12:36,290
When he's dead,
I will mend your ticket.

514
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:38,626
And the Crest?

515
01:12:38,693 --> 01:12:41,529
Harkan first, then we talk.

516
01:12:42,196 --> 01:12:43,898
Bring proof of death.

517
01:12:47,001 --> 01:12:48,836
I'll need a way in.

518
01:12:51,438 --> 01:12:53,040
I know a way.

519
01:12:54,175 --> 01:12:55,475
Klaus will take you.

520
01:13:04,785 --> 01:13:06,087
I am Klaus.

521
01:13:10,758 --> 01:13:12,860
John.
I am Klaus.

522
01:14:01,575 --> 01:14:02,843
Please tell your mistress

523
01:14:02,910 --> 01:14:04,812
that I am honored
by this gesture

524
01:14:04,879 --> 01:14:07,815
and I look forward to
our continuing partnership.

525
01:14:09,216 --> 01:14:10,518
I am Klaus.

526
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:20,027
Mr. John Wick

527
01:14:20,628 --> 01:14:22,096
in the flesh.

528
01:14:23,698 --> 01:14:26,934
The Baba Yaga.

529
01:14:28,169 --> 01:14:29,469
Must be Christmas, <i>ja?</i>

530
01:14:40,848 --> 01:14:42,683
Where are
my manners? Please.

531
01:14:48,622 --> 01:14:50,758
A drink, Mr. Wick?

532
01:14:53,961 --> 01:14:55,963
You were
expecting me.

533
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:57,131
Not me.

534
01:14:58,299 --> 01:14:59,499
Him.

535
01:15:00,301 --> 01:15:01,369
John?

536
01:15:04,071 --> 01:15:05,072
How are you?

537
01:15:07,108 --> 01:15:09,043
You knew I'd be here.

538
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:10,811
I suspected it.

539
01:15:11,512 --> 01:15:12,747
Family.

540
01:15:17,518 --> 01:15:20,688
That family
sold you out, Mr. Wick.

541
01:15:22,356 --> 01:15:23,691
They gave you up

542
01:15:23,758 --> 01:15:26,160
in the vain hope
of saving themselves.

543
01:15:27,461 --> 01:15:29,630
You see, that's why
I never trust the Cossacks.

544
01:15:29,697 --> 01:15:32,366
They are dirty people.

545
01:15:35,669 --> 01:15:37,738
This is personal.

546
01:15:40,241 --> 01:15:41,942
I sense tension here.

547
01:15:43,512 --> 01:15:45,813
Mr. Wick may
probably feel

548
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,549
I'm responsible
for the death of a...

549
01:15:49,483 --> 01:15:50,785
mutual friend.

550
01:15:54,055 --> 01:15:57,124
But I didn't kill Koji.
You did, John.

551
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:02,329
You know,
this discord
between old friends,

552
01:16:02,396 --> 01:16:03,764
it saddens me.

553
01:16:05,166 --> 01:16:06,167
Allow me to help.

554
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:10,104
<i>Nein.</i>

555
01:16:11,506 --> 01:16:12,740
We have a deal.

556
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:16,710
Had.

557
01:16:16,777 --> 01:16:18,245
The Marquis.

558
01:16:18,312 --> 01:16:20,381
Hell, I doubt he'll
mind if it's bullets,

559
01:16:20,448 --> 01:16:22,216
blades or a blind man.

560
01:16:43,037 --> 01:16:45,840
Is this
for me, Mr...

561
01:16:47,141 --> 01:16:48,142
Nobody.

562
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:52,113
And, no, it's actually
for him.

563
01:16:56,951 --> 01:17:00,087
Then take
a seat,
Mr. Nobody.

564
01:17:04,024 --> 01:17:05,826
Exciting, <i>ja?</i>

565
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:18,939
So, you want to kill him.

566
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:22,910
You want to kill him.

567
01:17:24,278 --> 01:17:25,813
I want to kill him.

568
01:17:26,914 --> 01:17:28,716
What about
you, Mr. Wick?

569
01:17:29,383 --> 01:17:31,385
I'm going to kill you.

570
01:17:31,452 --> 01:17:32,720
Oh.

571
01:17:32,786 --> 01:17:35,189
For Pyotr. Of course, <i>ja.</i>

572
01:17:36,724 --> 01:17:39,727
But it looks like
we have ourselves, uh,

573
01:17:39,793 --> 01:17:42,663
a genuine conundrum.

574
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:46,167
A quandary, if you will.
A real-life dilemma.

575
01:17:47,902 --> 01:17:49,170
So...

576
01:17:50,804 --> 01:17:53,107
How about we play a game?

577
01:17:53,174 --> 01:17:54,241
One hand.

578
01:17:55,109 --> 01:17:57,278
The winner decides who lives...

579
01:17:59,313 --> 01:18:00,781
and who does not.

580
01:18:05,786 --> 01:18:08,822
All right.
What's the buy-in?

581
01:18:08,889 --> 01:18:11,125
More than you can afford.

582
01:18:11,192 --> 01:18:12,993
Yeah,
I'm one bullet away

583
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,196
from being a very rich man.

584
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:18,098
Or a dead one.

585
01:18:20,367 --> 01:18:23,137
Five-card draw.

586
01:18:47,261 --> 01:18:48,295
Mr. Wick.

587
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:50,731
Mr. Wick?

588
01:19:14,021 --> 01:19:16,123
Dead man's hand, Mr. Wick.

589
01:19:20,127 --> 01:19:21,128
Well...

590
01:19:22,496 --> 01:19:24,098
I don't gamble.

591
01:19:26,735 --> 01:19:27,935
Let's see.

592
01:19:35,476 --> 01:19:37,746
Four nines. And a four.

593
01:19:37,811 --> 01:19:40,247
Most impressive.

594
01:19:52,092 --> 01:19:55,530
Ah. Royal flush.

595
01:19:55,597 --> 01:19:57,331
Pretty good for a nobody.

596
01:19:57,398 --> 01:19:58,499
Thank you.

597
01:20:00,535 --> 01:20:03,772
A blind man,
a guy with a dog

598
01:20:03,837 --> 01:20:05,806
and John Wick walk into a bar

599
01:20:05,873 --> 01:20:09,276
and take a seat at the table.

600
01:20:09,343 --> 01:20:11,412
That either sounds
like the beginning

601
01:20:11,478 --> 01:20:12,980
of a stupendous joke

602
01:20:13,047 --> 01:20:15,650
or a most
profitable opportunity.

603
01:20:17,851 --> 01:20:21,989
One thinks he can
serve his way out.

604
01:20:26,393 --> 01:20:27,562
One...

605
01:20:28,829 --> 01:20:31,131
thinks he can
buy his way out.

606
01:20:33,967 --> 01:20:35,402
And one...

607
01:20:36,904 --> 01:20:38,372
thinks he can kill

608
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,575
his way out.

609
01:20:43,310 --> 01:20:46,514
Each of them all think
that they have
the winning hand.

610
01:20:47,915 --> 01:20:49,249
But what they fail

611
01:20:50,284 --> 01:20:51,753
to realize

612
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:55,489
is that the moment they took
a seat at The Table...

613
01:20:58,859 --> 01:21:00,829
they had already lost.

614
01:21:00,894 --> 01:21:03,330
Let me guess.
Five of a kind?

615
01:21:04,965 --> 01:21:06,066
Yeah.

616
01:21:13,508 --> 01:21:15,008
Just so you know,

617
01:21:16,276 --> 01:21:18,345
Pyotr wasn't personal.

618
01:21:20,147 --> 01:21:21,348
Now, maybe a little bit.

619
01:21:25,018 --> 01:21:27,789
Kill!

620
01:22:46,501 --> 01:22:48,435
Hey!
He's over there!

621
01:25:43,578 --> 01:25:45,680
Nuts!

622
01:26:14,241 --> 01:26:16,410
Know what
your problem is,
Mr. Wick?

623
01:26:17,045 --> 01:26:19,479
You are unlucky.

624
01:26:20,948 --> 01:26:22,449
Unlucky in life,

625
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:24,317
in love,

626
01:26:24,384 --> 01:26:26,186
in friendship...

627
01:26:28,388 --> 01:26:29,657
and now...

628
01:26:31,191 --> 01:26:32,660
in death.

629
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:34,387
Killa!

630
01:28:23,303 --> 01:28:25,940
Why don't you
just die?

631
01:29:33,574 --> 01:29:34,809
He's mine.

632
01:29:36,911 --> 01:29:38,946
I told you
not to take a deal.

633
01:29:39,013 --> 01:29:41,381
Yeah, I guess
your deal didn't
work out either, huh?

634
01:29:42,149 --> 01:29:43,985
Huh?

635
01:29:44,051 --> 01:29:46,520
Hell of a thing
for them to take
your eyes, though.

636
01:29:51,192 --> 01:29:52,425
They didn't take them.

637
01:29:54,629 --> 01:29:55,796
I gave them.

638
01:31:32,093 --> 01:31:34,562
The Ruska Roma
will support

639
01:31:34,628 --> 01:31:35,796
your challenge.

640
01:31:37,031 --> 01:31:38,599
Who will be
your Second?

641
01:32:07,094 --> 01:32:09,930
A warning
of the cost of tyranny.

642
01:32:13,367 --> 01:32:16,704
You must intend
to join your concierge.

643
01:32:16,771 --> 01:32:18,039
Not today.

644
01:32:25,179 --> 01:32:27,281
Per the Old Ways
and the old laws,

645
01:32:27,348 --> 01:32:30,084
John Wick calls you to a duel.

646
01:32:30,151 --> 01:32:32,720
To settle your differences
the old-fashioned way,

647
01:32:32,787 --> 01:32:34,722
as gentlemen should.

648
01:32:36,957 --> 01:32:39,326
You speak of the Old Ways
as if you know them.

649
01:32:40,494 --> 01:32:42,563
A man of Mr. Wick's
station

650
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:44,331
cannot issue
such a challenge.

651
01:32:45,966 --> 01:32:48,102
He has
his family's crest.

652
01:32:50,771 --> 01:32:52,106
Hmm.

653
01:32:53,074 --> 01:32:54,108
Berlin.

654
01:32:54,175 --> 01:32:55,576
Ruska Roma challenge,

655
01:32:55,643 --> 01:32:57,578
the acceptance
of Mr. Wick
back into the fold,

656
01:32:57,645 --> 01:32:59,313
it's all there.

657
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:01,048
Recorded history now.

658
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:11,292
And why would I
accept this

659
01:33:11,358 --> 01:33:12,927
from a second-rate seat?

660
01:33:12,993 --> 01:33:15,296
Because there
are rules,
and without them...

661
01:33:15,362 --> 01:33:18,299
We live with
the animals.
Exactly.

662
01:33:19,767 --> 01:33:20,968
Mm.

663
01:33:21,869 --> 01:33:23,337
Times are changing.

664
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:25,673
A new day is dawning.

665
01:33:25,739 --> 01:33:28,609
New ideas, new rules,

666
01:33:29,477 --> 01:33:30,845
new management.

667
01:33:32,913 --> 01:33:35,049
Yet you will accept.

668
01:33:35,116 --> 01:33:39,053
Because we all still sit
beneath The Table.

669
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:42,356
Even you are not immune
to the consequences of failure.

670
01:33:50,231 --> 01:33:53,300
And what exactly
are Mr. Wick's terms?

671
01:33:54,135 --> 01:33:56,704
<i>Victoriae fiducia.</i>

672
01:33:56,770 --> 01:34:01,675
The unconditional release
of any and all obligations
to The Table.

673
01:34:16,023 --> 01:34:18,926
Ah, history is littered
with Marquis

674
01:34:18,993 --> 01:34:21,362
who were
only remembered
by their servants.

675
01:34:22,163 --> 01:34:23,230
But you...

676
01:34:25,132 --> 01:34:26,568
you could
be remembered

677
01:34:26,635 --> 01:34:29,003
as the man who brought
John Wick,

678
01:34:29,069 --> 01:34:30,738
the most
feared of all

679
01:34:30,804 --> 01:34:33,340
by The Table
and all who sit at it,
into the light.

680
01:34:34,808 --> 01:34:36,177
Your light.

681
01:34:38,412 --> 01:34:39,914
And who could predict

682
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:42,016
how high
that kind of glory

683
01:34:42,082 --> 01:34:44,418
could take a man
in our world?

684
01:35:01,302 --> 01:35:05,039
Noon, <i>La Tour Eiffel,</i>
to discuss rules.

685
01:35:05,906 --> 01:35:07,174
You may go.

686
01:35:08,342 --> 01:35:09,410
When I'm done.

687
01:35:10,844 --> 01:35:12,514
As his Second,
upon his victory,

688
01:35:12,581 --> 01:35:16,250
my Excommunicado
is to be lifted,
my title restored,

689
01:35:16,317 --> 01:35:19,253
my hotel rebuilt
and re-consecrated,

690
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:21,322
all at
The Table's expense.

691
01:35:23,658 --> 01:35:24,858
Of course.

692
01:35:35,102 --> 01:35:37,805
How you do anything
is how you do everything.

693
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:40,941
Now I'm done.

694
01:35:45,045 --> 01:35:46,981
I think I'll miss you
when you're gone.

695
01:35:47,047 --> 01:35:49,049
Shame I can't
say the same.

696
01:35:49,950 --> 01:35:51,485
You don't know,
do you?

697
01:35:52,587 --> 01:35:54,788
What's that?

698
01:35:54,855 --> 01:35:57,958
A man's Second,
like his sponsor,

699
01:35:58,025 --> 01:36:00,060
either walks out
with his champion

700
01:36:00,127 --> 01:36:02,029
or is buried beside him.

701
01:36:03,598 --> 01:36:05,132
The Old Ways.

702
01:36:13,374 --> 01:36:14,441
Such is life.

703
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:03,957
Under the Old Laws,

704
01:37:04,024 --> 01:37:06,226
only one can survive.

705
01:37:06,293 --> 01:37:08,028
Do you both
understand that?

706
01:37:11,766 --> 01:37:13,200
Very good.

707
01:37:13,267 --> 01:37:15,069
Rules.

708
01:37:15,135 --> 01:37:17,971
The Challenged
chooses first. Time?

709
01:37:19,808 --> 01:37:21,075
Sunrise.

710
01:37:26,715 --> 01:37:27,948
Now.

711
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:33,053
Sunrise.

712
01:37:33,555 --> 01:37:34,556
Location?

713
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:37,458
You come here

714
01:37:37,525 --> 01:37:39,993
thinking there is
a way out of this world
for you, Mr. Wick?

715
01:37:42,062 --> 01:37:43,297
There is not.

716
01:37:46,166 --> 01:37:48,035
Le Centre Pompidou.

717
01:37:50,739 --> 01:37:52,339
Sacré Coeur.

718
01:37:57,044 --> 01:37:58,312
Sacré Coeur.

719
01:37:59,514 --> 01:38:00,515
Weapons?

720
01:38:01,583 --> 01:38:02,950
If you win,

721
01:38:03,016 --> 01:38:05,018
The Table will
honor its word.

722
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:07,488
You will have
your freedom.

723
01:38:08,889 --> 01:38:10,324
But you won't take it.

724
01:38:11,593 --> 01:38:12,594
Blades.

725
01:38:18,566 --> 01:38:19,900
Pistols.

726
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:29,009
Dueling pistols.
Thirty paces.

727
01:38:29,076 --> 01:38:31,478
In the event that
both parties survive,

728
01:38:31,546 --> 01:38:34,948
each will approach the other
at increments of ten paces

729
01:38:35,015 --> 01:38:37,384
until only one remains.

730
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:40,220
Rules of engagement.

731
01:38:41,488 --> 01:38:42,956
No quarter.

732
01:38:43,023 --> 01:38:45,593
You know why
you won't take
your freedom?

733
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:47,494
Hmm?

734
01:38:49,029 --> 01:38:51,098
Because this
is who you are,

735
01:38:51,999 --> 01:38:53,535
who you've
always been.

736
01:38:55,804 --> 01:38:57,639
You are a killer.

737
01:38:59,973 --> 01:39:02,610
An orphan we plucked
from the street

738
01:39:02,677 --> 01:39:05,145
and honed into a knife.

739
01:39:05,212 --> 01:39:08,048
And it is the killing
that gives you purpose.

740
01:39:09,049 --> 01:39:10,984
A man
without purpose...

741
01:39:12,787 --> 01:39:14,121
is nothing.

742
01:39:16,524 --> 01:39:17,725
No quarter.

743
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:21,228
No quarter.

744
01:39:21,295 --> 01:39:24,164
If there is nothing else,
gentlemen,

745
01:39:24,231 --> 01:39:25,966
I will see...
A nomination.

746
01:39:30,437 --> 01:39:31,539
It is his right.

747
01:39:33,307 --> 01:39:34,975
Do you have a name?

748
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:41,215
Caine.

749
01:39:43,751 --> 01:39:45,587
So be it.

750
01:39:45,653 --> 01:39:47,555
Sunrise, Sacré Coeur.

751
01:39:49,156 --> 01:39:51,526
Dueling pistols,
no quarter.

752
01:39:51,593 --> 01:39:54,061
Should Mr. Wick
be victorious,

753
01:39:54,127 --> 01:39:55,964
he will be free of any
and all obligation

754
01:39:56,063 --> 01:39:57,632
to The High Table,

755
01:39:57,699 --> 01:39:59,968
and his Second
will be reinstated

756
01:40:00,033 --> 01:40:02,269
as the manager
of the rebuilt

757
01:40:02,336 --> 01:40:04,037
New York Continental.

758
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:09,777
Should the Marquis
Vincent Bisset de Gramont
be victorious...

759
01:40:09,844 --> 01:40:11,546
John Wick will be dead.

760
01:40:13,815 --> 01:40:15,349
As will his Second.

761
01:40:17,217 --> 01:40:18,987
Just so.

762
01:40:19,052 --> 01:40:20,387
Now, if there is
nothing more, gentlemen,

763
01:40:20,454 --> 01:40:22,624
I will see you
at sunrise.

764
01:40:22,690 --> 01:40:24,424
Failure to meet
at the appointed hour

765
01:40:24,491 --> 01:40:26,026
will result
in forfeiture

766
01:40:26,093 --> 01:40:28,262
and immediate execution.

767
01:40:39,239 --> 01:40:42,309
There is no John
out there.

768
01:40:43,545 --> 01:40:46,313
No happy husband
with a normal life.

769
01:40:49,116 --> 01:40:50,552
There's only John Wick,

770
01:40:51,519 --> 01:40:52,620
the killer.

771
01:40:54,956 --> 01:40:57,090
And he's going to kill you.

772
01:41:03,765 --> 01:41:04,832
<i>Your hotel?</i>

773
01:41:05,934 --> 01:41:07,234
Yes.

774
01:41:07,301 --> 01:41:09,236
You always have
an angle, don't you?

775
01:41:09,303 --> 01:41:11,238
Doesn't everyone?

776
01:41:11,305 --> 01:41:15,108
Let's find safe harbor
before it starts.

777
01:41:15,175 --> 01:41:17,045
There's something
I need to do first.

778
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:19,514
Sooner rather
than later.

779
01:41:23,216 --> 01:41:24,886
Won't do it.

780
01:41:24,953 --> 01:41:26,420
You fight
your own fight.

781
01:41:30,324 --> 01:41:32,159
Isn't this
what you want?

782
01:41:33,895 --> 01:41:35,362
Hmm?

783
01:41:35,429 --> 01:41:37,164
<i>Victoriae fiducia.</i>

784
01:41:38,198 --> 01:41:39,534
You kill him,

785
01:41:39,601 --> 01:41:41,569
and you and your
daughter will be free.

786
01:41:43,738 --> 01:41:45,238
No one can touch her.

787
01:41:46,741 --> 01:41:48,576
If you don't,

788
01:41:48,643 --> 01:41:51,411
she will have to face
the consequences.

789
01:41:52,981 --> 01:41:55,115
The choice is yours.

790
01:43:21,669 --> 01:43:22,737
Caine.

791
01:43:23,671 --> 01:43:24,806
John.

792
01:43:25,940 --> 01:43:27,307
Saying goodbyes?

793
01:43:29,242 --> 01:43:30,878
Saying hello.

794
01:43:36,150 --> 01:43:37,952
You think your wife
can hear you?

795
01:43:40,555 --> 01:43:41,656
No.

796
01:43:45,225 --> 01:43:46,561
Then why bother?

797
01:43:48,696 --> 01:43:50,230
Maybe I'm wrong.

798
01:43:53,968 --> 01:43:55,570
The dead are gone.

799
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:00,942
Only the living matter.

800
01:44:06,379 --> 01:44:08,683
After my daughter was born...

801
01:44:10,585 --> 01:44:12,252
I wanted to leave this life.

802
01:44:14,889 --> 01:44:16,256
I thought I did.

803
01:44:18,492 --> 01:44:19,994
But you didn't.

804
01:44:22,262 --> 01:44:23,698
We're damned...

805
01:44:25,867 --> 01:44:26,968
you and I.

806
01:44:28,435 --> 01:44:30,538
On that we agree.

807
01:44:34,609 --> 01:44:36,409
My daughter's not.

808
01:44:39,580 --> 01:44:41,649
If it's between
you and her...

809
01:44:43,818 --> 01:44:45,452
you're going to die.

810
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:53,828
Maybe not.

811
01:44:59,033 --> 01:45:00,568
I missed you, John.

812
01:45:02,637 --> 01:45:05,438
It's so good
to sit with a friend.

813
01:45:10,410 --> 01:45:12,513
I'll see you
tomorrow.

814
01:45:42,577 --> 01:45:45,445
This is how you
resolve the situation?

815
01:45:45,513 --> 01:45:47,648
Duello with
the Baba Yaga.

816
01:45:47,715 --> 01:45:50,885
Failure will shake
the foundation
of The High Table,

817
01:45:52,286 --> 01:45:55,523
and it will turn Wick
into a saint.

818
01:45:58,192 --> 01:46:00,528
My victory will
do the opposite.

819
01:46:03,097 --> 01:46:04,699
Marquis de Gramont!

820
01:46:06,366 --> 01:46:08,536
A man's ambition

821
01:46:08,603 --> 01:46:10,872
should never exceed his worth.

822
01:46:13,741 --> 01:46:16,777
You would do well
to remember that, sir.

823
01:47:37,525 --> 01:47:39,527
<i>Bonjour,</i>
Monsieur Wick.

824
01:47:39,593 --> 01:47:42,462
And welcome
to <i>La Resistance.</i>

825
01:47:42,530 --> 01:47:44,632
A little far from home,
aren't you?

826
01:47:44,699 --> 01:47:46,067
Well, your little act

827
01:47:46,133 --> 01:47:48,703
of uncivil disobedience
inspired me, John.

828
01:47:48,769 --> 01:47:50,371
I'm branching out,

829
01:47:50,438 --> 01:47:52,673
spreading my wings.

830
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:54,742
How goes the Grand
Farewell Tour?

831
01:47:56,410 --> 01:47:57,945
Coming to an end.

832
01:47:58,879 --> 01:48:01,215
So it seems. So it seems.

833
01:48:02,383 --> 01:48:04,484
Forty-two regular,
wasn't it?

834
01:48:05,485 --> 01:48:07,021
It's Kevlar,
front to back.

835
01:48:07,088 --> 01:48:08,956
The latest
in ballistic chic.

836
01:48:09,023 --> 01:48:10,825
Appropriate for
all formal occasions.

837
01:48:10,891 --> 01:48:14,028
Weddings, funerals,
High Table duels.

838
01:48:14,095 --> 01:48:15,763
After all, a man
has to look his best

839
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:17,598
when it's time
to get married.

840
01:48:19,133 --> 01:48:20,134
Or buried.

841
01:48:30,978 --> 01:48:32,046
Forgive me, sir,

842
01:48:32,813 --> 01:48:34,281
but this is madness.

843
01:48:35,483 --> 01:48:36,951
Madness?

844
01:48:37,018 --> 01:48:38,986
Trusting your fate
to a blind man?

845
01:48:40,287 --> 01:48:43,157
There are three types
of men in this world.

846
01:48:44,925 --> 01:48:47,995
Those who
have something
to live for,

847
01:48:48,062 --> 01:48:51,132
those who
have something
to die for,

848
01:48:51,198 --> 01:48:53,968
and those who
have something
to kill for.

849
01:48:54,035 --> 01:48:56,704
John Wick has
none of these things.

850
01:48:56,771 --> 01:49:00,007
He is but a ghost
in search of a graveyard.

851
01:49:01,442 --> 01:49:02,843
But the blind man,

852
01:49:04,145 --> 01:49:05,646
well, he has all three.

853
01:49:07,381 --> 01:49:09,417
Besides, I have a feeling

854
01:49:09,483 --> 01:49:11,619
Mr. Wick will never make it

855
01:49:11,685 --> 01:49:13,788
to the duel by sunrise.

856
01:49:58,632 --> 01:50:00,201
All right, now.

857
01:50:00,267 --> 01:50:03,003
For all you boppers out there
in the City of Lights,

858
01:50:03,070 --> 01:50:06,974
for all you street people
with an ear for the action,

859
01:50:07,041 --> 01:50:09,310
<i>to all my loyal listeners</i>

860
01:50:09,376 --> 01:50:12,313
<i>who know the beat</i>
<i>of the street...</i>

861
01:50:12,379 --> 01:50:16,951
<i>...tonight is your chance</i>
<i>to make some beautiful music.</i>

862
01:50:17,017 --> 01:50:20,488
I've been asked
to relay a special request

863
01:50:20,555 --> 01:50:22,323
<i>from a secret admirer.</i>

864
01:50:23,390 --> 01:50:25,025
<i>It seems there's a thorn</i>

865
01:50:25,092 --> 01:50:28,563
<i>in our little</i>
<i>slice of paradise.</i>

866
01:50:28,629 --> 01:50:30,865
<i>A wicked man from the Big Apple</i>

867
01:50:30,931 --> 01:50:34,268
<i>is making a beeline</i>
<i>to our sacred heart.</i>

868
01:50:35,436 --> 01:50:36,871
<i>We are putting the call out</i>

869
01:50:36,937 --> 01:50:40,808
<i>to deliver your hardest beats</i>
<i>to this man in black.</i>

870
01:50:40,875 --> 01:50:45,212
<i>If you want the prize,</i>
<i>you must finish before sunrise.</i>

871
01:50:45,279 --> 01:50:47,381
This golden oldie,

872
01:50:47,448 --> 01:50:50,484
and I do mean golden hit,

873
01:50:50,552 --> 01:50:53,187
goes out to you, Mr. Wick.

874
01:50:55,089 --> 01:50:58,025
And remember,
there is nowhere to run.

875
01:52:03,824 --> 01:52:05,092
<i>I want to thank you all</i>

876
01:52:05,159 --> 01:52:09,330
<i>for listening to WUXIA,</i>

877
01:52:09,396 --> 01:52:12,567
<i>the place for</i>
<i>all your entertainment</i>

878
01:52:12,634 --> 01:52:14,768
<i>and informational needs.</i>

879
01:52:14,835 --> 01:52:16,237
<i>Good hunting.</i>

880
01:52:18,573 --> 01:52:20,174
And so it begins.

881
01:52:21,509 --> 01:52:23,811
I'm going to need a gun.

882
01:52:25,112 --> 01:52:26,780
I thought
you'd never ask.

883
01:52:28,115 --> 01:52:30,552
Nine-millimeter Pit Viper.

884
01:52:30,619 --> 01:52:32,319
How'd you get this?

885
01:52:32,386 --> 01:52:35,489
I know a guy
who knows a guy
who shot a guy.

886
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:38,359
Twenty-one round
capacity magazine

887
01:52:38,425 --> 01:52:39,426
with a built-in compensator

888
01:52:39,493 --> 01:52:41,328
for virtually no muzzle flip.

889
01:52:41,395 --> 01:52:43,297
Fiber-optic front sight,

890
01:52:43,364 --> 01:52:44,965
ambidextrous safeties,

891
01:52:45,032 --> 01:52:47,569
flared magwell
for faster reloads,

892
01:52:47,636 --> 01:52:49,604
two-pound
extreme trigger,

893
01:52:49,671 --> 01:52:52,306
and for those more,
how shall we say,

894
01:52:52,373 --> 01:52:54,074
intimate encounters,

895
01:52:54,141 --> 01:52:57,211
this Viper has
ferocious fucking fangs.

896
01:53:02,149 --> 01:53:05,052
How close can you
get me to the church?

897
01:53:10,224 --> 01:53:11,292
Amen.

898
01:53:21,368 --> 01:53:24,038
Here we are,
gentlemen.

899
01:53:25,573 --> 01:53:26,675
Your ride.

900
01:53:30,077 --> 01:53:31,478
When I advised you

901
01:53:31,546 --> 01:53:32,913
not to dip
your pinky

902
01:53:32,980 --> 01:53:34,749
back into this pond,

903
01:53:34,815 --> 01:53:37,084
I didn't think
I'd get wet.

904
01:53:39,853 --> 01:53:42,122
It'll all be over
after today.

905
01:53:45,059 --> 01:53:47,261
When I was
burying Charon,

906
01:53:49,196 --> 01:53:52,232
I was torn about
what to put
on his gravestone.

907
01:53:53,501 --> 01:53:56,870
A few words
to sum up
an entire life?

908
01:53:56,937 --> 01:54:00,007
Long live the king!

909
01:54:00,074 --> 01:54:02,076
Had mine made
years ago.

910
01:54:03,444 --> 01:54:04,478
Modest.

911
01:54:04,546 --> 01:54:06,413
Prophetic.

912
01:54:07,582 --> 01:54:09,216
What did you decide?

913
01:54:10,217 --> 01:54:12,052
Friend.

914
01:54:12,119 --> 01:54:14,556
That's what he was
above all else.

915
01:54:15,322 --> 01:54:16,457
A friend.

916
01:54:25,533 --> 01:54:28,168
<i>Au revoir</i>
<i>et bonne chasse,</i>
<i>Monsieur</i> Wick.

917
01:54:29,903 --> 01:54:31,305
Thank you, King.

918
01:54:33,874 --> 01:54:35,142
Jonathan.

919
01:54:36,276 --> 01:54:37,444
Winston.

920
01:54:37,512 --> 01:54:40,414
Sunrise is at 6:03.

921
01:54:40,481 --> 01:54:43,150
Don't be late for
all our sakes, hmm?

922
01:54:52,694 --> 01:54:54,161
"Loving husband."

923
01:54:54,596 --> 01:54:56,163
Hmm?

924
01:54:56,230 --> 01:54:58,533
That's what I want on mine.

925
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:01,201
"John. Loving husband."

926
01:55:31,031 --> 01:55:32,266
Confirmed.

927
01:55:33,601 --> 01:55:35,469
<i>Good news, boppers.</i>

928
01:55:35,537 --> 01:55:37,137
We have a sighting.

929
01:55:38,272 --> 01:55:40,107
<i>Our man in black</i>
<i>has been spotted</i>

930
01:55:40,174 --> 01:55:42,443
<i>in the</i> Septième Arrondissement.

931
01:55:42,510 --> 01:55:46,447
<i>I think it's high time</i>
<i>we paint him red.</i>

932
01:57:48,970 --> 01:57:53,173
It seems like
our friends at the guild
dropped the ball,

933
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:56,176
<i>and now it's rolling</i>
<i>to the Arc de Triomphe.</i>

934
01:57:56,243 --> 01:57:58,178
<i>Let's see who picks it up.</i>

935
02:00:03,037 --> 02:00:04,539
<i>Come on now, people.</i>

936
02:00:04,605 --> 02:00:06,708
We're gonna have
to do a lot better.

937
02:00:10,678 --> 02:00:13,581
<i>Now, who's gonna be</i>
<i>our big winner?</i>

938
02:02:41,295 --> 02:02:42,730
Who is this?

939
02:02:42,797 --> 02:02:44,364
You know, the question
you should be asking,

940
02:02:44,431 --> 02:02:46,133
huh, is how much?

941
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:48,502
I think we have
the situation under control.

942
02:02:57,311 --> 02:02:59,280
Because the way
I see it,

943
02:02:59,347 --> 02:03:02,116
<i>is that if Mr. Johnny Boy</i>
<i>makes it to the church</i>
<i>on time,</i>

944
02:03:02,183 --> 02:03:04,819
this could be your
last night as Marquis.

945
02:04:17,959 --> 02:04:19,961
<i>A little traffic update.</i>

946
02:04:20,027 --> 02:04:23,597
<i>I'm hearing the boys in black</i>
<i>couldn't get it done.</i>

947
02:04:23,664 --> 02:04:26,499
<i>Our wicked friend</i>
<i>is on the move again.</i>

948
02:04:26,567 --> 02:04:30,538
He's headed your way,
my listeners of the 8th.

949
02:06:34,195 --> 02:06:35,196
Yes?

950
02:06:35,262 --> 02:06:37,665
Fine. You have a deal.

951
02:06:37,731 --> 02:06:39,534
All right. 35 it is.

952
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:42,470
That wasn't our deal.

953
02:06:46,907 --> 02:06:49,176
Well, that's the only deal
being offered today.

954
02:07:12,766 --> 02:07:13,968
Get him!

955
02:07:22,476 --> 02:07:23,578
Phone!

956
02:07:28,115 --> 02:07:30,251
What?
Now, you
listen to me.

957
02:07:30,317 --> 02:07:31,352
<i>Forty.</i>

958
02:07:32,786 --> 02:07:35,156
You pay for the service.

959
02:07:47,835 --> 02:07:49,904
<i>Good news, boppers.</i>

960
02:07:52,139 --> 02:07:54,441
The lottery just went up.

961
02:12:53,974 --> 02:12:58,011
<i>To all you boppers</i>
<i>still sitting on the side,</i>

962
02:12:58,078 --> 02:13:01,415
<i>Mr. Wick has</i>
<i>the church in sight.</i>

963
02:13:03,016 --> 02:13:05,787
<i>We are almost out of time.</i>

964
02:13:05,854 --> 02:13:07,822
<i>Last chance to win the prize</i>

965
02:13:07,889 --> 02:13:11,492
<i>before Mr. Wick's last sunrise.</i>

966
02:13:11,559 --> 02:13:16,230
<i>So who out there is going</i>
<i>to climb those 222 steps?</i>

967
02:17:55,076 --> 02:17:58,345
It appears Mr. Wick
won't be joining us.

968
02:18:17,265 --> 02:18:18,533
John?

969
02:18:21,235 --> 02:18:22,570
John?

970
02:18:24,105 --> 02:18:25,540
Caine.

971
02:18:25,606 --> 02:18:27,340
What time is sunrise?

972
02:18:30,443 --> 02:18:31,679
Two...

973
02:18:32,980 --> 02:18:34,515
maybe three minutes.

974
02:18:35,817 --> 02:18:39,053
I need you to get to the top
of those stairs, John.

975
02:18:43,090 --> 02:18:44,357
Yeah.

976
02:18:51,464 --> 02:18:52,733
Ready?

977
02:18:53,400 --> 02:18:54,702
Yeah.

978
02:19:13,486 --> 02:19:14,889
Twelve or nine?

979
02:19:16,057 --> 02:19:17,091
Nine.

980
02:19:50,558 --> 02:19:52,392
Six upstairs.
Thanks.

981
02:21:07,702 --> 02:21:09,203
<i>Ciao, ciao,</i> Mr. Wick.

982
02:21:22,683 --> 02:21:23,985
You can't shoot me.

983
02:21:28,089 --> 02:21:29,690
Yeah, you're right.

984
02:21:30,490 --> 02:21:31,692
But I can shoot him.

985
02:21:43,971 --> 02:21:46,941
But I can hit you,
motherfucker.

986
02:21:48,342 --> 02:21:49,610
Let's go, John.

987
02:22:15,603 --> 02:22:17,605
Nuts.

988
02:22:25,346 --> 02:22:26,814
You hit my puppy.

989
02:22:43,964 --> 02:22:45,166
You know,
you owe me.

990
02:22:46,167 --> 02:22:47,168
Yeah.

991
02:22:55,843 --> 02:22:57,344
Nothing personal,
John.

992
02:22:58,479 --> 02:23:00,114
We're even now.

993
02:23:01,148 --> 02:23:02,349
Yeah.

994
02:23:52,766 --> 02:23:54,768
And so we begin.

995
02:24:15,089 --> 02:24:18,893
We seek the truth
and will endure
the consequences.

996
02:24:18,959 --> 02:24:21,362
Consequences.

997
02:24:40,981 --> 02:24:42,349
Go on now. Come on.

998
02:25:21,488 --> 02:25:22,890
Positions, gentlemen.

999
02:25:35,903 --> 02:25:38,372
See you
in the next life,
brother.

1000
02:25:40,508 --> 02:25:42,109
Thirty paces.

1001
02:26:30,457 --> 02:26:32,860
Remember
your daughter.
Fuck off!

1002
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:43,103
What a beautiful sunrise.

1003
02:27:02,423 --> 02:27:04,458
Last words, Winston?

1004
02:27:05,826 --> 02:27:07,428
Just have fun out there.

1005
02:27:31,686 --> 02:27:33,555
Are you ready, Mr. Caine?

1006
02:27:40,294 --> 02:27:41,362
Mr. Wick?

1007
02:28:06,053 --> 02:28:07,388
Fire!

1008
02:28:27,675 --> 02:28:29,376
Twenty paces!

1009
02:29:03,410 --> 02:29:04,445
Fire!

1010
02:29:16,323 --> 02:29:17,324
Nice.

1011
02:29:24,866 --> 02:29:26,668
Ten paces!

1012
02:30:16,985 --> 02:30:18,418
Just kill him.

1013
02:30:38,272 --> 02:30:40,474
Those who cling to death,

1014
02:30:42,075 --> 02:30:43,310
live.

1015
02:30:46,046 --> 02:30:48,248
Those who cling to life,

1016
02:30:49,449 --> 02:30:50,552
die.

1017
02:31:00,762 --> 02:31:02,095
Fire!

1018
02:31:41,101 --> 02:31:42,302
As your sponsor,

1019
02:31:44,606 --> 02:31:46,574
I claim the <i>coup de grâce.</i>

1020
02:31:50,344 --> 02:31:52,312
Your weapon,
give it to me.

1021
02:31:53,146 --> 02:31:54,816
Is my daughter
free now?

1022
02:31:56,183 --> 02:31:58,418
<i>Oui.</i> You
and your daughter.

1023
02:31:59,087 --> 02:32:00,287
Enjoy.

1024
02:32:18,305 --> 02:32:19,841
- Rules.
- Ha.

1025
02:32:21,576 --> 02:32:24,411
You arrogant
asshole,

1026
02:32:25,113 --> 02:32:26,681
he didn't shoot.

1027
02:32:27,882 --> 02:32:29,316
Consequences.

1028
02:32:45,399 --> 02:32:47,200
That's fucking good.

1029
02:32:59,246 --> 02:33:00,581
Hmm.

1030
02:33:07,387 --> 02:33:10,357
Your obligation
to The Table...

1031
02:33:12,060 --> 02:33:14,227
is satisfied,
John Wick.

1032
02:33:14,294 --> 02:33:15,495
You are free.

1033
02:33:20,601 --> 02:33:22,970
As are you
and your daughter, sir.

1034
02:33:25,807 --> 02:33:28,776
You will be
fully reinstated,
Mr. Manager.

1035
02:33:30,078 --> 02:33:31,478
All of your terms

1036
02:33:32,814 --> 02:33:34,515
will be fulfilled.

1037
02:33:40,353 --> 02:33:43,457
Our business here now
is concluded.

1038
02:33:43,524 --> 02:33:45,492
Good day.

1039
02:34:26,234 --> 02:34:27,434
My brother.

1040
02:34:30,738 --> 02:34:32,339
You owe me one.

1041
02:34:34,976 --> 02:34:36,043
Yeah.

1042
02:34:58,633 --> 02:34:59,767
Winston.

1043
02:35:00,768 --> 02:35:01,969
Jonathan.

1044
02:35:04,572 --> 02:35:06,439
Will you take me home?

1045
02:35:13,413 --> 02:35:14,782
Of course.

1046
02:36:48,376 --> 02:36:49,644
Helen.

1047
02:37:51,272 --> 02:37:53,541
Never thought
I'd see the day.

1048
02:37:58,879 --> 02:38:01,849
Where do you think he is,
heaven or hell?

1049
02:38:07,555 --> 02:38:08,923
Who knows?
