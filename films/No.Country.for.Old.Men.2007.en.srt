1
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,694
<i>I was sheriff of this county
when I was 25 years old.</i>

2
00:00:53,779 --> 00:00:55,822
<i>Hard to believe.</i>

3
00:00:55,864 --> 00:00:59,367
<i>My grandfather was a lawman.
Father too.</i>

4
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:05,206
<i>Me and him was sheriffs at the same
time, him up in Plano and me out here.</i>

5
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,209
<i>I think he's pretty proud of that.</i>

6
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:09,837
<i>I know I was.</i>

7
00:01:11,423 --> 00:01:14,842
<i>Some of the old-time sheriffs
never even wore a gun.</i>

8
00:01:14,884 --> 00:01:18,512
<i>Folks find that hard to believe.
Jim Scarborough never carried one.</i>

9
00:01:18,596 --> 00:01:20,222
<i>That's the younger Jim.</i>

10
00:01:20,306 --> 00:01:24,767
<i>Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one
up in Comanche County.</i>

11
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:28,355
<i>I always liked to hear
about the old-timers.</i>

12
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:31,400
<i>Never missed a chance to do so.</i>

13
00:01:31,484 --> 00:01:36,029
<i>You can't help but compare yourself
against the old-timers.</i>

14
00:01:36,114 --> 00:01:39,950
<i>Can't help but wonder
how they'd have operated these times.</i>

15
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:44,873
<i>There's this boy I sent to the electric
chair at Huntsville here a while back.</i>

16
00:01:44,957 --> 00:01:48,292
<i>My arrest and my testimony.</i>

17
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:52,964
<i>He killed a 14-year-old girl.</i>

18
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:55,550
<i>Paper said it was a crime of passion,</i>

19
00:01:55,593 --> 00:01:58,470
<i>but he told me there
wasn't any passion to it.</i>

20
00:01:58,554 --> 00:02:02,765
<i>Told me he'd planned to kill somebody
for as long as he could remember.</i>

21
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,727
<i>Said if they turned him out,
he'd do it again.</i>

22
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:08,396
<i>Said he knew he was going to hell.</i>

23
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:10,898
<i>Be there in about 15 minutes.</i>

24
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,734
<i>I don't know what to make of that.</i>

25
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:16,069
<i>I sure do don't.</i>

26
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:21,869
<i>The crime you see now,
it's hard to even take its measure.</i>

27
00:02:21,912 --> 00:02:24,580
<i>It's not that I'm afraid of it.</i>

28
00:02:25,582 --> 00:02:30,377
<i>I always knew you had to be willing
to die to even do this job.</i>

29
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,756
<i>But I don't want to push
my chips forward and go out</i>

30
00:02:34,798 --> 00:02:38,259
<i>and meet something I don't understand.</i>

31
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:44,767
<i>A man would have
to put his soul at hazard.</i>

32
00:02:46,353 --> 00:02:48,521
<i>He'd have to say, "OK.</i>

33
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:54,694
<i>I'll be part of this world. "</i>

34
00:02:56,364 --> 00:02:59,114
Yes, sir, I just walked in the door.

35
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:01,283
He had some sort of thing on him,

36
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:04,954
like a oxygen tank
for emphysema or something,

37
00:03:04,996 --> 00:03:07,332
and a hose that run down his sleeve.

38
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,960
<i>Oxygen tank?
What the hell's he got that for?</i>

39
00:03:10,002 --> 00:03:12,796
You got me. Well,
you can look at it when you get in.

40
00:03:12,838 --> 00:03:17,300
<i>- I'll be down there in a bit.
- Yes, sir, I got it under control.</i>

41
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:58,070
- Howdy. What's this about?
- Step out of the car please, sir.

42
00:04:58,112 --> 00:04:59,321
What is that?

43
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:01,740
I need you to step out of the car, sir.

44
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:11,584
- What is that for?
- Would you...?

45
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:14,672
Would you hold still please, sir?

46
00:05:44,493 --> 00:05:46,662
You hold still.

47
00:05:55,964 --> 00:05:57,631
Shit.

48
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:28,848
<i>Agua.</i>

49
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:31,892
<i>Agua.</i>

50
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,739
<i>Agua.</i>

51
00:09:47,618 --> 00:09:49,578
I ain't got no water.

52
00:09:51,414 --> 00:09:53,707
Agua.

53
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:03,383
<i>Agua.</i>

54
00:10:04,885 --> 00:10:06,719
I told you I ain't got no agua.

55
00:10:21,652 --> 00:10:22,903
Do you speak English?

56
00:10:25,365 --> 00:10:27,241
Where's the last guy?

57
00:10:27,325 --> 00:10:32,079
ltimo hombre, last man standing. There
must have been one. Where'd he go?

58
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:41,296
I reckon I go out the way I come in.

59
00:10:43,925 --> 00:10:46,468
<i>Hay lobos.</i>

60
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:48,929
There ain't no lobos.

61
00:11:03,654 --> 00:11:06,698
You stopped to watch
your backtrack.

62
00:11:08,242 --> 00:11:10,618
Now shoot my dumb ass.

63
00:11:13,622 --> 00:11:16,458
But if you stop,

64
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,543
you stopped in shade.

65
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:22,753
Yeah.

66
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:31,824
<i>My place is wrong?</i>

67
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:35,495
<i>Yours is the first place
Danzer and Dora will look if they...</i>

68
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,580
<i>If they know.</i>

69
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:42,669
- What's in the satchel?
- It's full of money.

70
00:14:42,753 --> 00:14:45,004
That would be the day.

71
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:47,841
- Where'd you get the pistol?
- At the gettin' place.

72
00:14:49,177 --> 00:14:52,346
- Did you buy that gun?
- No. I found it.

73
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:57,725
- Llewelyn.
- What? Quit your hollering.

74
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:00,353
What'd you get for that thing?

75
00:15:01,356 --> 00:15:04,692
You don't need to know everything,
Carla Jean.

76
00:15:04,776 --> 00:15:08,195
- I need to know that.
- Keep running that mouth of yours,

77
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:10,864
I'm gonna take you in the back
and screw you.

78
00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:14,035
- Big talk.
- Keep it up.

79
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,205
Fine. I don't want to know.

80
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:21,250
I don't even want to know
where you been all day.

81
00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:23,043
That'll work.

82
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,728
All right.

83
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:46,901
- Llewelyn?
- Yeah?

84
00:15:49,196 --> 00:15:52,574
- What're you doing, baby?
- I'm going out.

85
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:54,784
Going where?

86
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:57,746
A little something I forgot to do,
but I'll be back.

87
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,166
- And what're you gonna do?
- I'm fixing to do something

88
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,461
dumber than hell, but I'm going anyways.

89
00:16:05,588 --> 00:16:08,089
If I don't come back,
you tell Mother I love her.

90
00:16:09,383 --> 00:16:11,260
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

91
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,641
Well, then I'll tell her myself.

92
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:14,195
- How much?
- Sixty-nine cents.

93
00:21:14,237 --> 00:21:15,738
And the gas?

94
00:21:15,822 --> 00:21:18,366
Y'all getting any rain up your way?

95
00:21:19,493 --> 00:21:23,622
- What way would that be?
- Well, I seen you was from Dallas.

96
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,710
What business is it of yours
where I'm from...

97
00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:31,296
...friendo?

98
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:36,968
- Well, I didn't mean nothing by it.
- You didn't mean nothing?

99
00:21:37,053 --> 00:21:39,429
I was just passing the time.

100
00:21:40,682 --> 00:21:44,559
If you don't want to accept that,
I don't know what else I can do for you.

101
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:51,024
- Will there be something else?
- I don't know. Will there?

102
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,283
- Is something wrong?
- With what?

103
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:00,785
With anything.

104
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:05,998
Is that what you're asking me?
Is there something wrong with anything?

105
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:09,502
- Will there be anything else?
- You already asked me that.

106
00:22:12,923 --> 00:22:16,467
- Well, I need to see about closing now.
- See about closing?

107
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,469
- Yes, sir.
- What time do you close?

108
00:22:18,512 --> 00:22:20,805
- Now. We close now.
- Now is not a time.

109
00:22:20,848 --> 00:22:24,976
- What time do you close?
- Generally around dark. At dark.

110
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:30,815
You don't know what
you're talking about, do you?

111
00:22:30,858 --> 00:22:32,985
Sir?

112
00:22:33,027 --> 00:22:36,697
I said you don't know
what you're talking about.

113
00:22:39,074 --> 00:22:41,785
- What time do you go to bed?
- Sir?

114
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:45,456
You're a bit deaf, aren't you?
I said, what time do you go to bed?

115
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:49,168
Oh.

116
00:22:49,753 --> 00:22:53,380
Somewhere around 9:30.
I'd say around 9:30.

117
00:22:53,465 --> 00:22:55,007
I could come back then.

118
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:57,509
Why would you be coming back?
We'll be closed.

119
00:22:57,594 --> 00:22:59,344
Yeah, you said that.

120
00:23:00,597 --> 00:23:05,183
- Well, I got to close now.
- You live in that house out back?

121
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:09,314
- Yes, I do.
- You lived here all your life?

122
00:23:10,858 --> 00:23:14,986
Well, this is my wife's
father's place, originally.

123
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:18,698
You married into it?

124
00:23:18,741 --> 00:23:22,660
We lived in Temple, Texas
for many years.

125
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:26,705
Raised a family there. In Temple.

126
00:23:26,748 --> 00:23:30,876
- We come out here about four years ago.
- You married into it?

127
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:36,174
- If that's the way you want to put it.
- Well, I don't have some way to put it.

128
00:23:36,217 --> 00:23:37,967
That's the way it is.

129
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,978
What's the most you ever lost
on a coin toss?

130
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:54,067
- Sir?
- The most you ever lost on a coin toss?

131
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:57,696
Oh, I don't know. I couldn't say.

132
00:24:00,575 --> 00:24:02,076
- Call it.
- Call it?

133
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,286
- Yes.
- For what?

134
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:05,579
Just call it.

135
00:24:08,041 --> 00:24:11,835
Well, we need to know
what we're calling it for here.

136
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,338
You need to call it.
I can't call it for you.

137
00:24:15,422 --> 00:24:18,509
- Or it wouldn't be fair.
- I didn't put nothing up.

138
00:24:18,593 --> 00:24:22,097
Yes, you did. You've been
putting it up your whole life.

139
00:24:22,181 --> 00:24:24,558
You just didn't know it.

140
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,644
- You know what date is on this coin?
- No.

141
00:24:27,728 --> 00:24:32,023
1958. It's been traveling
22 years to get here.

142
00:24:32,108 --> 00:24:36,819
And now it's here.
And it's either heads or tails.

143
00:24:36,903 --> 00:24:38,279
You have to say. Call it.

144
00:24:38,321 --> 00:24:41,782
Well, look,
I need to know what I stand to win.

145
00:24:41,825 --> 00:24:44,660
- Everything.
- How's that?

146
00:24:44,744 --> 00:24:47,330
You stand to win everything. Call it.

147
00:24:51,461 --> 00:24:54,839
All right. Heads, then.

148
00:24:59,677 --> 00:25:00,886
Well done.

149
00:25:02,847 --> 00:25:04,973
- Don't put it in your pocket.
- Sir?

150
00:25:05,057 --> 00:25:08,143
Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter.

151
00:25:08,644 --> 00:25:10,145
Where do you want me to put it?

152
00:25:10,229 --> 00:25:12,356
Anywhere not in your pocket.

153
00:25:12,441 --> 00:25:16,903
Or it'll get mixed in with the others
and become just a coin.

154
00:25:19,906 --> 00:25:21,489
Which it is.

155
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:33,753
Llewelyn?

156
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:38,342
What the hell?

157
00:25:39,552 --> 00:25:42,721
- Odessa.
- Why would we go to Odessa?

158
00:25:42,805 --> 00:25:46,223
No, not we. You.
You stay with your mother.

159
00:25:46,308 --> 00:25:47,600
Well, how come?

160
00:25:47,684 --> 00:25:51,938
Look, right now it's midnight Sunday.
Courthouse opens nine hours from now.

161
00:25:52,022 --> 00:25:56,108
Someone's gonna call in the number
on the inspection plate of my truck.

162
00:25:56,193 --> 00:25:58,444
And around 9:30,
they'll show up here.

163
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,073
- How long do we...?
- What point would you quit

164
00:26:01,157 --> 00:26:04,369
bothering to look
for your two million dollars?

165
00:26:04,411 --> 00:26:06,620
What am I supposed to tell Mama?

166
00:26:06,704 --> 00:26:09,373
Stand in the door and holler,
"Mama, I'm home!"?

167
00:26:09,415 --> 00:26:11,708
- Llewelyn.
- Come on, pack your things.

168
00:26:11,793 --> 00:26:14,628
Anything you leave,
you ain't gonna see again.

169
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,883
Well, don't fall down apologizing.

170
00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:22,177
Oh, baby, things happen.

171
00:26:23,054 --> 00:26:25,097
Come on, I can't take them back.

172
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,539
Mind riding bitch?

173
00:27:02,428 --> 00:27:04,762
This his truck?

174
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:10,602
Got a screwgie?

175
00:27:13,773 --> 00:27:18,402
- Who cut his tires?
- Mexicans, I guess. Wasn't us.

176
00:27:19,195 --> 00:27:22,364
- That is a dead dog.
- Yes, it is.

177
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:28,620
- Where's the receiver?
- I've got it.

178
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:32,624
These are some ripe petunias.

179
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,543
Hold this, please.

180
00:27:42,302 --> 00:27:44,136
Want it?

181
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:49,851
- Getting anything on this?
- Not a bleep.

182
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,644
All right.

183
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:56,149
Give me that.

184
00:28:05,992 --> 00:28:08,661
- I thought it was a car afire.
- It is a car afire.

185
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:12,165
Wendell said there's something
in the back country too.

186
00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:13,249
Step in there.

187
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:16,336
When's the county gonna start
paying rent on my horse?

188
00:28:16,378 --> 00:28:19,507
- I love you more and more every day.
- That's very nice.

189
00:28:20,842 --> 00:28:22,510
- Be careful.
- Always am.

190
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:24,261
- Don't get hurt.
- Never do.

191
00:28:24,346 --> 00:28:26,179
Don't hurt no one.

192
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:30,308
If you say so.

193
00:29:04,554 --> 00:29:08,348
- Wouldn't think a car'd burn like that.
- Yes, sir.

194
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:10,767
We should've brought wienies.

195
00:29:10,852 --> 00:29:13,769
That look like about
a '77 Ford to you, Wendell?

196
00:29:13,854 --> 00:29:17,064
- It could be.
- I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.

197
00:29:17,149 --> 00:29:22,154
- The old boy shot by the highway?
- Yes, sir. His vehicle.

198
00:29:22,238 --> 00:29:26,408
Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car,
killed that man on the highway,

199
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:31,914
swapped for his car, now here it is and
he's swapped again for God knows what.

200
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:34,417
That's very linear, sheriff.

201
00:29:35,418 --> 00:29:38,628
- Age'll flatten a man, Wendell.
- Yes, sir.

202
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:40,797
- Then there's this other.
- Yeah.

203
00:29:42,884 --> 00:29:45,093
- You ride Winston.
- You sure?

204
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:49,432
Oh, I'm more than sure. If anything
happens to Loretta's horse out here,

205
00:29:49,474 --> 00:29:52,935
I can tell you, I don't want
to be the party that was aboard.

206
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:57,898
It's the same tire tread coming back as
going. Made about the same time too.

207
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,108
You can see the sipes real clear.

208
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:05,948
Somebody's pried the inspection plate
off the door on this one.

209
00:30:07,117 --> 00:30:09,785
I know this truck.

210
00:30:09,828 --> 00:30:12,414
Belongs to a feller named Moss.

211
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:15,292
- Llewelyn Moss?
- That's the boy.

212
00:30:15,376 --> 00:30:19,254
- You figure him for a dope runner?
- I don't know.

213
00:30:19,297 --> 00:30:23,090
- I kindly doubt it.
- O.K. Corral is just yonder.

214
00:30:25,177 --> 00:30:27,929
Oh, hell's bells,
they even shot the dog.

215
00:30:30,891 --> 00:30:33,184
This is just
a deal gone wrong, isn't it?

216
00:30:33,268 --> 00:30:37,522
Yup. Appears to have been
a glitch or two.

217
00:30:41,153 --> 00:30:45,113
- What calibers you got there, sheriff?
- Nine-millimeter.

218
00:30:45,156 --> 00:30:48,325
Couple of. 45 ACPs.

219
00:30:48,368 --> 00:30:52,120
Somebody unloaded on that thing
with a shotgun.

220
00:30:54,582 --> 00:30:56,959
How come the coyotes
ain't been at them?

221
00:30:57,001 --> 00:30:59,127
I don't know.

222
00:31:03,926 --> 00:31:06,844
Supposedly, a coyote
won't eat a Mexican.

223
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:09,388
These boys appear to be managerial.

224
00:31:10,181 --> 00:31:13,768
I think we're looking at more
than one fracas. Execution here.

225
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:16,229
Wild West over there.

226
00:31:17,189 --> 00:31:21,651
- It's that Mexican brown dope.
- Oh, these boys is all swole up.

227
00:31:21,694 --> 00:31:24,570
So this was earlier.
Getting set to trade.

228
00:31:24,655 --> 00:31:26,532
Then, differences, and...

229
00:31:27,826 --> 00:31:31,577
- Might not even a been no money.
- That's possible.

230
00:31:31,662 --> 00:31:34,956
- But you don't believe it?
- No.

231
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,333
Probably I don't.

232
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,046
Well, it's a mess, ain't it, sheriff?

233
00:31:43,882 --> 00:31:46,843
If it ain't,
it'll do till the mess gets here.

234
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,712
Yes, sir?

235
00:33:42,797 --> 00:33:46,842
- I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
- Did you go up to his trailer?

236
00:33:46,926 --> 00:33:49,844
- Yes, I did.
- Well, I'd say he's at work.

237
00:33:49,886 --> 00:33:52,847
- Do you want to leave a message?
- Where does he work?

238
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:55,015
I can't say.

239
00:33:56,769 --> 00:33:57,894
Where does he work?

240
00:33:57,979 --> 00:34:02,482
Sir, I ain't at liberty to give out
no information about our residents.

241
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:04,734
Where does he work?

242
00:34:05,528 --> 00:34:07,864
Did you not hear me?

243
00:34:07,906 --> 00:34:10,992
We can't give out no information.

244
00:34:33,098 --> 00:34:37,267
- Why all the way to Del Rio?
- I'm gonna borrow a car from Roberto.

245
00:34:37,351 --> 00:34:41,271
- You can't afford one?
- I don't want to register it.

246
00:34:41,356 --> 00:34:44,066
- Look, I'll call you in a couple days.
- Promise?

247
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:45,109
Yes, I do.

248
00:34:46,362 --> 00:34:51,241
- I got a bad feeling, Llewelyn.
- I got a good one. Oughta even out.

249
00:34:51,284 --> 00:34:54,703
Listen, you gotta quit
your worrying so much.

250
00:34:54,746 --> 00:34:56,663
Mama's gonna raise hell.

251
00:34:56,748 --> 00:34:58,748
She's just gonna cuss you up and down.

252
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:02,585
- Well, you should be used to that.
- I'm used to lots of things.

253
00:35:02,669 --> 00:35:05,630
- I work at Wal-Mart.
- Not anymore, Carla Jean.

254
00:35:05,714 --> 00:35:07,590
You are retired.

255
00:35:07,674 --> 00:35:09,592
- Llewelyn?
- Yes, ma'am?

256
00:35:11,638 --> 00:35:16,309
- You are coming back, ain't you?
- I shall return.

257
00:35:21,065 --> 00:35:23,357
Sheriff's department!

258
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,361
Look at that lock.

259
00:35:29,781 --> 00:35:32,491
- We going in?
- Gun out and up.

260
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:39,123
- What about yours?
- I'm hiding behind you.

261
00:35:42,127 --> 00:35:44,212
Sheriff's department!

262
00:36:09,989 --> 00:36:13,157
- I believe they done lit a shuck.
- I believe you're right.

263
00:36:13,576 --> 00:36:17,370
- That from the lock?
- Probably must be.

264
00:36:17,454 --> 00:36:21,124
- So when was he here, sheriff?
- I don't know. Oh...

265
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:23,668
- Now that's aggravating.
- Sheriff?

266
00:36:23,752 --> 00:36:29,676
- Still sweating.
- Oh, sheriff! We just missed him!

267
00:36:30,678 --> 00:36:34,013
We gotta circulate this on radio.

268
00:36:34,055 --> 00:36:35,306
All right.

269
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:38,434
What do we circulate?

270
00:36:40,687 --> 00:36:44,398
Looking for a man
who has recently drunk milk?

271
00:36:47,152 --> 00:36:51,698
- Oh, sheriff, that's aggravating.
- I'm ahead of you there.

272
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:57,536
Think this boy Moss has got any notion
of the sorts of sons-of-bitches

273
00:36:57,621 --> 00:37:00,540
- that are hunting him?
- I don't know. He ought to.

274
00:37:04,045 --> 00:37:08,715
He's seen the same things I've seen and
it certainly made an impression on me.

275
00:37:14,972 --> 00:37:17,266
- Take me to a motel.
- Got one in mind?

276
00:37:17,351 --> 00:37:18,600
Someplace cheap.

277
00:37:20,645 --> 00:37:24,230
- You tell me the option.
- Do what now?

278
00:37:24,273 --> 00:37:27,901
You pick the option
goes with the applicable rate.

279
00:37:29,278 --> 00:37:32,489
I'm just one person,
so it don't matter the size of the bed.

280
00:37:38,163 --> 00:37:41,582
<i>This is Roberto's
Automotive. I'm not in right now.</i>

281
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:43,417
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

282
00:39:42,498 --> 00:39:46,251
<i>- Hello?
- Is Llewelyn there?</i>

283
00:39:46,336 --> 00:39:49,755
<i>Llewelyn? No, he ain't.</i>

284
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,757
You expect him?

285
00:39:51,841 --> 00:39:55,637
<i>Now why would
I expect him? Who is this?</i>

286
00:40:03,228 --> 00:40:06,647
- May I help you?
- Yeah, you got a pair of Larry Mahans?

287
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:08,065
Shoulder, size 11?

288
00:40:08,149 --> 00:40:10,819
- I'll check.
- You all sell socks?

289
00:40:10,903 --> 00:40:14,405
- Just white.
- Well, white's all I wear. Bathroom?

290
00:40:40,392 --> 00:40:43,644
Don't stop.
Just ride me up past those rooms.

291
00:40:43,728 --> 00:40:47,772
- What room?
- Just drive me around.

292
00:40:47,815 --> 00:40:50,108
I wanna see if someone's here.

293
00:40:57,616 --> 00:40:59,617
Keep going. Don't stop.

294
00:40:59,702 --> 00:41:02,663
I don't wanna get into
some kind of a jackpot here.

295
00:41:02,747 --> 00:41:04,666
It's all right.

296
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,461
Why don't I just set you down
right here and we won't argue about it?

297
00:41:08,504 --> 00:41:11,797
- Take me to another motel.
- Let's just call it square.

298
00:41:11,882 --> 00:41:15,009
You're in the jackpot,
and I'm trying to get you out of it.

299
00:41:15,093 --> 00:41:17,136
Take me to another motel.

300
00:42:05,811 --> 00:42:08,647
Lab reports from Austin
on that blood by the highway.

301
00:42:08,689 --> 00:42:10,899
- What was the bullet?
- Wasn't no bullet.

302
00:42:12,568 --> 00:42:16,114
- Wasn't no bullet?
- Yes, sir. Wasn't none.

303
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:21,118
Well, Wendell, with all due respect,
that don't make a lot of sense.

304
00:42:21,203 --> 00:42:22,328
No, sir.

305
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:26,540
You said entry wound in the forehead,
no exit wound.

306
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:28,876
- Yes, sir.
- You telling me he shot this boy

307
00:42:28,919 --> 00:42:31,253
and then went digging around
with a knife?

308
00:42:32,881 --> 00:42:35,675
- Sir, I don't wanna picture that.
- I don't either.

309
00:42:35,717 --> 00:42:38,052
Can I freshen that there for you,
sheriff?

310
00:42:38,136 --> 00:42:41,056
Yeah, Maureen, you better had.

311
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,891
Ranger and the DEA
are headed back out to the scene.

312
00:42:43,934 --> 00:42:46,560
Gonna join 'em?

313
00:42:46,603 --> 00:42:49,189
Any new bodies accumulate out there?

314
00:42:50,483 --> 00:42:53,568
- No, sir.
- Well, then I guess I can skip it.

315
00:43:08,084 --> 00:43:12,421
- Twelve-gauge. You need shells?
- Yeah, double-ought.

316
00:43:12,463 --> 00:43:16,299
- Yeah, that'll give you a wallop.
- Y'all got camping supplies?

317
00:43:16,384 --> 00:43:19,678
Tent poles. You already have the tent?

318
00:43:19,762 --> 00:43:21,513
Well, something like that.

319
00:43:21,597 --> 00:43:24,434
Give me the model number on the tent,
I can order poles.

320
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,936
- Never mind. I want a tent.
- What kind?

321
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,979
The kind with most poles.

322
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:54,046
- Could I get another room?
- You wanna change rooms?

323
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,799
No, ma'am, I wanna keep my room
and get another one.

324
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,344
- Another additional?
- Yes, ma'am.

325
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:01,805
And do you have a map of the rooms?

326
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:04,516
Well, yeah, we had a sorta one.

327
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,479
Oh, thank you.

328
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:13,817
How about 38?

329
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:18,571
Well, you can have the one right next to
yours if you want, 137. It ain't took.

330
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:22,701
- No, 38 will be fine.
- Well, that's got two double beds.

331
00:50:58,065 --> 00:50:59,357
How'd you find that?

332
00:52:46,844 --> 00:52:49,721
You shouldn't be doin' that.

333
00:52:49,805 --> 00:52:53,349
Even a young man like you.

334
00:52:53,392 --> 00:52:57,061
- Doin' what?
- Hitchhiking.

335
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,527
Dangerous.

336
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:26,091
You know Anton Chigurh by sight,
is that correct?

337
00:53:26,176 --> 00:53:29,720
Yes, sir, I know him every which way.

338
00:53:29,763 --> 00:53:32,139
When did you last see him?

339
00:53:33,767 --> 00:53:36,935
...November 28th, last year.

340
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:40,272
Seem pretty sure of the date.
Did I ask you to sit?

341
00:53:41,066 --> 00:53:45,194
No, sir, but you struck me as a man
who wouldn't wanna waste a chair.

342
00:53:45,236 --> 00:53:50,742
I remember dates, names, numbers.
I saw him November the 28th.

343
00:53:52,912 --> 00:53:54,578
Got a loose cannon here.

344
00:53:54,663 --> 00:53:58,083
We're out a bunch of money,
and the other party is out his product.

345
00:53:58,167 --> 00:54:01,044
- Yes, sir.
- This account will give up

346
00:54:01,087 --> 00:54:05,423
$1,200 in any 24-hour period.
That's up from a thousand.

347
00:54:05,466 --> 00:54:09,636
If your expenses run higher,
I hope you'll trust us for it.

348
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,805
OK.

349
00:54:11,889 --> 00:54:15,642
- Just how well do you know Chigurh?
- What do you wanna know?

350
00:54:15,726 --> 00:54:19,603
I just wanna know your opinion of him,
in general.

351
00:54:19,688 --> 00:54:25,152
- Just how dangerous is he?
- Compared to what, the bubonic plague?

352
00:54:25,237 --> 00:54:27,446
He's bad enough you called me.

353
00:54:27,489 --> 00:54:31,992
Yeah, he's a psychopathic killer,
but so what?

354
00:54:32,077 --> 00:54:33,869
There's plenty of them around.

355
00:54:33,954 --> 00:54:36,622
Killed three men
in a Del Rio motel yesterday,

356
00:54:36,707 --> 00:54:40,291
and two others in that
colossal goat-fuck out in the desert.

357
00:54:40,376 --> 00:54:43,294
- We can stop that.
- Seem pretty sure of yourself.

358
00:54:45,632 --> 00:54:49,969
You've led something of a charmed life,
haven't you, Mr. Wells?

359
00:54:50,011 --> 00:54:55,307
In all honesty, I can't say that charm
has had a whole lot to do with it.

360
00:54:56,978 --> 00:54:59,396
- I was wondering...
- Yes?

361
00:55:00,314 --> 00:55:02,482
Could you validate my parking ticket?

362
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:09,113
- An attempt at humor, I suppose?
- I'm sorry.

363
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:19,249
You know, I counted the floors
to this building from the street.

364
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:21,835
- And?
- There's one missing.

365
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:26,547
We'll look into it.

366
00:55:46,487 --> 00:55:49,362
One room. One night.

367
00:55:49,447 --> 00:55:53,074
- That'll be $26.
- Alrighty.

368
00:55:57,163 --> 00:55:58,413
You on all night?

369
00:55:58,498 --> 00:56:01,709
Yes, sir, I'll be right here
till 10:00 in the morning.

370
00:56:03,378 --> 00:56:07,841
This here's for you. Now, I ain't
asking you to do anything illegal.

371
00:56:07,884 --> 00:56:10,928
There's someone
who been looking for me. Not police.

372
00:56:11,012 --> 00:56:13,721
You just call me
if anyone else checks in tonight.

373
00:56:13,806 --> 00:56:16,015
And by anyone, I mean any swinging dick.

374
00:56:58,518 --> 00:57:00,644
There just ain't no way.

375
01:02:38,283 --> 01:02:40,911
Don't worry, I ain't gonna hurt you.

376
01:02:40,953 --> 01:02:42,787
I need you
to drive me on outta here.

377
01:05:49,896 --> 01:05:52,146
- Why not?
- I don't know, man.

378
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,965
Were you in a car accident?

379
01:06:19,884 --> 01:06:22,261
I'll give you 500 bucks for that coat.

380
01:06:23,972 --> 01:06:25,098
Lemme see the money.

381
01:06:28,144 --> 01:06:29,644
Were you in a car accident?

382
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:34,358
- Yeah.
- OK, give me the money.

383
01:06:34,401 --> 01:06:38,361
- It's right here. Give me the clothes.
- Let him hold the money.

384
01:06:45,077 --> 01:06:46,661
Give it here.

385
01:06:54,546 --> 01:06:55,671
Gimme that beer too.

386
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:00,176
How much?

387
01:07:00,885 --> 01:07:02,719
Brian, give him the beer.

388
01:09:14,856 --> 01:09:16,356
<i>M dico...</i>

389
01:09:17,567 --> 01:09:19,609
<i>...por favor.</i>

390
01:11:23,154 --> 01:11:24,487
Wait up!

391
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:30,327
<i>... and I had a 44 inch waist.
My diet specialist got a hold of me,</i>

392
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,538
<i>and that first week,
I lost seven pounds!</i>

393
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:36,167
<i>Looking back on the diet, it was
relatively easy to lose the weight,</i>

394
01:11:36,251 --> 01:11:40,086
<i>though it did have moments. Sometimes,
it looked as if I gained weight</i>

395
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:43,590
<i>instead of lost it.
The most difficult part is still ahead.</i>

396
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:46,010
<i>Keeping weight off
now that we've lost it.</i>

397
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:48,471
<i>It's natural
for you to gain a few pounds.</i>

398
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:52,184
<i>But as soon as you do,
make sure you go on...</i>

399
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:53,704
<i>Here are a few points to remember.
First of all, weigh in every day.</i>

400
01:13:22,901 --> 01:13:24,944
Any word on those vehicles yet?

401
01:13:25,028 --> 01:13:28,072
Sheriff, I found out
everything there was to find.

402
01:13:28,115 --> 01:13:32,704
Those vehicles are titled
and registered to deceased people.

403
01:13:32,788 --> 01:13:35,289
The owner of that Bronco's
been dead 20 years.

404
01:13:35,331 --> 01:13:37,583
Want me to find out
about the Mexican ones?

405
01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:40,460
No. Lord, no.

406
01:13:40,503 --> 01:13:42,588
There's this month's checks.

407
01:13:43,131 --> 01:13:46,133
That DEA agent called again.
You don't wanna talk to him?

408
01:13:46,175 --> 01:13:48,886
Gonna try to keep from it much as I can.

409
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:51,972
Going back. Wanted to know
if you wanted to go with him.

410
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:53,265
That's cordial of him.

411
01:13:55,185 --> 01:13:56,853
Can I get you to call Loretta,

412
01:13:56,937 --> 01:13:59,646
tell her I'm going to Odessa
to see Carla Jean Moss?

413
01:13:59,689 --> 01:14:02,691
- Yes, sheriff.
- I'll call her when I get there.

414
01:14:02,775 --> 01:14:05,486
I'd call now, but if she
want me to come home, I might.

415
01:14:05,571 --> 01:14:08,364
Do you want me to wait
till you quit the building?

416
01:14:08,449 --> 01:14:12,160
Don't wanna lie without
what it's absolutely necessary.

417
01:14:15,748 --> 01:14:18,291
What is it Torbert says
about truth and justice?

418
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:23,004
Oh, we dedicate ourselves daily anew.
Something like that.

419
01:14:23,047 --> 01:14:26,090
I'm gonna commence
dedicating myself twice daily.

420
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:29,010
Might come to three before it's over.

421
01:14:30,471 --> 01:14:31,804
What the hell?

422
01:14:40,649 --> 01:14:42,024
Sheriff?

423
01:14:42,525 --> 01:14:44,610
You looked at your load lately?

424
01:14:46,196 --> 01:14:50,699
- That is a damn outrage.
- One of those tie-downs worked loose.

425
01:14:50,784 --> 01:14:56,080
- How many bodies did you leave with?
- I ain't lost none of 'em, sheriff.

426
01:14:56,164 --> 01:14:58,540
Couldn't y'all have
taken a van out there?

427
01:14:58,583 --> 01:15:00,960
We didn't have no van
with four-wheel drive.

428
01:15:01,044 --> 01:15:03,712
You gonna write me up
for improperly secured load?

429
01:15:03,797 --> 01:15:05,714
You get your ass outta here.

430
01:15:08,801 --> 01:15:12,096
Buenos d as.

431
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:15,767
I'm guessing this isn't the future
you had pictured for yourself

432
01:15:15,851 --> 01:15:18,436
when you first clapped eyes
on that money.

433
01:15:18,896 --> 01:15:21,648
Don't worry.
I'm not the man who's after you.

434
01:15:23,067 --> 01:15:24,943
I know that.

435
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,445
I've seen him.

436
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:30,864
You've seen him?
And you're not dead?

437
01:15:33,159 --> 01:15:35,912
What's this guy supposed to be,
the ultimate badass?

438
01:15:35,997 --> 01:15:38,081
Don't think that's how I'd describe him.

439
01:15:38,165 --> 01:15:40,041
How would you describe him?

440
01:15:40,084 --> 01:15:44,295
I guess I'd say
he doesn't have a sense of humor.

441
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:46,923
- His name's Chigurh.
- Sugar?

442
01:15:47,008 --> 01:15:49,468
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh.

443
01:15:49,553 --> 01:15:52,888
- You know how he found you?
- Yeah, I know how he found me.

444
01:15:52,931 --> 01:15:56,141
- It's called a transponder.
- I know what it's called.

445
01:15:56,225 --> 01:15:58,935
- He won't find me again.
- Not that way.

446
01:15:58,978 --> 01:16:01,814
- Not any way.
- Took me about three hours.

447
01:16:01,898 --> 01:16:06,569
- Yeah, well, I been immobile.
- No. You don't understand.

448
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:12,158
- What do you do?
- I'm retired.

449
01:16:12,242 --> 01:16:14,994
- What did you do?
- Welder.

450
01:16:15,078 --> 01:16:17,328
- Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
- Any of it.

451
01:16:17,413 --> 01:16:19,956
- If it can be welded, I can weld it.
- Cast iron?

452
01:16:19,999 --> 01:16:21,791
- Yeah.
- I don't mean braze.

453
01:16:21,876 --> 01:16:23,794
- I didn't say braze.
- Pot metal?

454
01:16:23,879 --> 01:16:25,338
What did I say?

455
01:16:26,924 --> 01:16:31,636
- Were you in 'Nam?
- Yeah, I was 'Nam.

456
01:16:33,473 --> 01:16:35,474
So was I.

457
01:16:35,558 --> 01:16:37,893
So, what does that make me, your buddy?

458
01:16:39,478 --> 01:16:44,690
Look, you gotta give me this money.
I got no other reason to protect you.

459
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:48,486
It's too late. I spent it.

460
01:16:49,488 --> 01:16:51,823
A million and a half
on whores and whiskey,

461
01:16:51,908 --> 01:16:54,659
and the rest of it,
I just sorta blew it in.

462
01:16:56,537 --> 01:16:58,998
How do you know he's not
on his way to Odessa?

463
01:17:03,211 --> 01:17:07,130
- Why would he go to Odessa?
- Kill your wife.

464
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:18,851
Maybe he's the one
that needs to be worried... about me.

465
01:17:18,894 --> 01:17:20,561
He isn't.

466
01:17:20,646 --> 01:17:24,273
Yeah. You're not cut out for this.

467
01:17:24,358 --> 01:17:27,859
You're just a guy
who happened to find those vehicles.

468
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:35,952
I'm across the river at the Hotel Eagle.

469
01:17:36,995 --> 01:17:39,455
Carson Wells.

470
01:17:39,541 --> 01:17:41,542
Call me when you've had enough.

471
01:17:41,584 --> 01:17:44,545
I can even let you keep
a little of the money.

472
01:17:44,629 --> 01:17:48,048
If I was into cutting deals,
why wouldn't I deal with Sugar?

473
01:17:48,091 --> 01:17:52,552
No, no, you don't understand.
You can't make a deal with him.

474
01:17:52,594 --> 01:17:57,390
Even if you gave him the money, he'd
still kill you for inconveniencing him.

475
01:17:57,474 --> 01:17:59,684
He's a peculiar man.

476
01:17:59,726 --> 01:18:04,857
Might even say he has principles,
principles that transcend money or drugs

477
01:18:04,899 --> 01:18:08,570
or anything like that. Not like you.

478
01:18:09,446 --> 01:18:11,864
Yeah. He's not even like me.

479
01:18:11,906 --> 01:18:15,534
No, he don't talk as much as you.
I give him points for that.

480
01:18:18,246 --> 01:18:20,539
Carla Jean, thank you for coming.

481
01:18:20,582 --> 01:18:22,374
Don't know why I did.

482
01:18:22,417 --> 01:18:25,377
I told you, I don't know where he is.

483
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:27,754
- You haven't heard from him?
- No, I ain't.

484
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:29,632
- Nothing?
- Not word one.

485
01:18:29,717 --> 01:18:33,928
- Would you tell me if you had?
- Well, I don't know.

486
01:18:33,971 --> 01:18:38,807
- He don't need any trouble from you.
- It ain't me he's in trouble with.

487
01:18:38,892 --> 01:18:42,478
- Who's he in trouble with then?
- Some pretty bad people.

488
01:18:42,563 --> 01:18:46,274
These people will kill him, Carla Jean.
They won't quit.

489
01:18:46,358 --> 01:18:49,402
He won't neither. He never has.

490
01:18:50,112 --> 01:18:53,531
He can take all comers.

491
01:18:55,118 --> 01:18:58,745
You know Charlie Walser's
got that place out east of Sanderson?

492
01:19:00,539 --> 01:19:04,626
You know how he used to slaughter
beeves, hit 'em right there with a maul,

493
01:19:04,668 --> 01:19:06,502
truss 'em and slit their throats?

494
01:19:06,587 --> 01:19:09,756
Charlie's got one all trussed up,
all set to drain him

495
01:19:09,798 --> 01:19:12,133
and the beef comes to,
thrashing around.

496
01:19:13,052 --> 01:19:15,721
Six hundred pounds
of very pissed off livestock.

497
01:19:15,805 --> 01:19:18,390
You'll excuse the... Well...

498
01:19:18,475 --> 01:19:21,019
Charlie grabs a gun,
shoot the thing in the head,

499
01:19:21,103 --> 01:19:24,146
but with the swinging and thrashing,
it's a glance shot.

500
01:19:24,189 --> 01:19:26,815
Ricochets, hits Charlie in the shoulder.

501
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:30,527
You go see Charlie, he still can't
pick up his right hand for his hat.

502
01:19:30,612 --> 01:19:34,823
The point being, that even in
the contest between man and steer,

503
01:19:34,908 --> 01:19:36,700
the issue is not certain.

504
01:19:44,376 --> 01:19:49,046
When Llewelyn calls,
just tell him I can make him safe.

505
01:19:52,885 --> 01:19:57,639
'Course, they slaughter
steers a lot different these days.

506
01:19:57,682 --> 01:20:01,810
Use a air gun. Shoots out a little rod
about that far under the brain.

507
01:20:01,852 --> 01:20:05,021
Sucks right back in.
Animal never knows what hit him.

508
01:20:07,983 --> 01:20:11,736
- Why are you telling me that, sheriff?
- I don't know.

509
01:20:15,366 --> 01:20:17,117
My mind wanders.

510
01:21:40,328 --> 01:21:42,537
Hello, Carson.

511
01:21:44,832 --> 01:21:46,458
Let's go to your room.

512
01:21:58,764 --> 01:22:01,349
You don't have to do this.

513
01:22:01,433 --> 01:22:05,477
I'm a day trader.
I could just go home.

514
01:22:07,397 --> 01:22:10,274
- You could.
- Make it worth your while,

515
01:22:10,317 --> 01:22:14,530
take you to an ATM.
There's 14 grand in it.

516
01:22:14,614 --> 01:22:16,949
And everybody just walks away.

517
01:22:18,284 --> 01:22:20,369
An ATM.

518
01:22:24,374 --> 01:22:27,500
I know where the satchel is.

519
01:22:27,543 --> 01:22:29,836
If you knew, you would have it with you.

520
01:22:29,878 --> 01:22:33,798
I can find it from the river bank.
I know where it is.

521
01:22:35,342 --> 01:22:38,261
- I know something better.
- What's that?

522
01:22:38,345 --> 01:22:39,847
Where it's going to be.

523
01:22:41,474 --> 01:22:45,019
- Where's that?
- It will be brought to me

524
01:22:45,062 --> 01:22:47,564
and placed at my feet.

525
01:22:49,442 --> 01:22:52,359
You don't know to a certainty.

526
01:22:52,444 --> 01:22:56,405
- In 20 minutes it could be here.
- I do know to a certainty.

527
01:22:56,489 --> 01:22:59,199
And you know what's
gonna happen now, Carson?

528
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:04,873
You should admit your situation.
There would be more dignity in it.

529
01:23:10,045 --> 01:23:12,880
You go to hell.

530
01:23:13,715 --> 01:23:16,967
All right.
Let me ask you something.

531
01:23:18,762 --> 01:23:23,558
If the rule you followed
brought you to this,

532
01:23:23,601 --> 01:23:26,227
of what use was the rule?

533
01:23:31,776 --> 01:23:35,696
Do you have any idea how crazy you are?

534
01:23:36,864 --> 01:23:39,240
You mean the nature
of this conversation?

535
01:23:39,283 --> 01:23:41,451
I mean the nature of you.

536
01:23:45,748 --> 01:23:51,586
You... You can have the money, Anton.

537
01:24:31,671 --> 01:24:34,047
<i>- Hello?
- Yes?</i>

538
01:24:35,716 --> 01:24:38,969
Is, Carson Wells there?

539
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:43,682
Not in the sense that you mean.

540
01:24:45,851 --> 01:24:49,854
<i>- You need to come see me.
- Who is this?</i>

541
01:24:49,939 --> 01:24:52,941
You know who it is.

542
01:24:52,984 --> 01:24:56,152
<i>- You need to talk to me.
- I don't need to talk to you.</i>

543
01:24:56,237 --> 01:24:58,572
I think you do.

544
01:24:58,656 --> 01:25:00,365
Do you know where I'm going?

545
01:25:00,449 --> 01:25:03,035
Why would I care where you're going?

546
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,788
I know where you are.

547
01:25:05,831 --> 01:25:08,040
<i>Yeah, where am I?</i>

548
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:12,378
You're in the hospital across the river,
but that's not where I'm going.

549
01:25:13,297 --> 01:25:15,381
Do you know where I'm going?

550
01:25:17,217 --> 01:25:21,262
<i>- Yeah, I know where you're going.
- All right.</i>

551
01:25:21,346 --> 01:25:22,888
<i>You know she won't be there.</i>

552
01:25:22,973 --> 01:25:25,433
It doesn't make any difference
where she is.

553
01:25:25,517 --> 01:25:27,685
So, what're you going up there for?

554
01:25:31,315 --> 01:25:33,857
You know how this is gonna turn out,
don't you?

555
01:25:35,819 --> 01:25:37,361
Nope.

556
01:25:37,404 --> 01:25:41,700
I think you do.
So this is what I'll offer.

557
01:25:42,702 --> 01:25:45,245
You bring me the money,
and I'll let her go.

558
01:25:45,330 --> 01:25:50,000
<i>Otherwise, she's accountable,
the same as you.</i>

559
01:25:52,086 --> 01:25:54,504
That's the best deal you're gonna get.

560
01:25:54,547 --> 01:25:58,507
I won't tell you you can save yourself,
because you can't.

561
01:26:01,763 --> 01:26:05,223
Yeah, I'm gonna bring you something,
all right.

562
01:26:05,266 --> 01:26:07,434
Decided to make you a project of mine.

563
01:26:07,518 --> 01:26:10,187
You ain't gonna have
to come look for me at all.

564
01:26:14,485 --> 01:26:17,070
- The motel in Del Rio?
- Yes, sir.

565
01:26:17,112 --> 01:26:18,904
None of the three had ID on 'em,

566
01:26:18,946 --> 01:26:22,741
but they're tellin' me that all three
is Mexican... was Mexicans.

567
01:26:22,784 --> 01:26:27,664
There's a question,
whether they stopped being and when.

568
01:26:29,667 --> 01:26:31,584
Yes, sir.

569
01:26:31,669 --> 01:26:34,253
Wendell, did you inquire
about the lock cylinder?

570
01:26:34,338 --> 01:26:36,964
- Yes, sir. It was punched out.
- OK.

571
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,802
- Wanna drive out there?
- No, that's all I had to look for,

572
01:26:40,886 --> 01:26:43,428
it sound like these boys
died of natural causes.

573
01:26:43,471 --> 01:26:47,433
- How's that, sheriff?
- Natural to the line of work they in.

574
01:26:47,476 --> 01:26:50,354
- Yes, sir.
- My God, Wendell, it's all-out war.

575
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:54,441
I can't think of any other word for it.
Who are these people?

576
01:26:54,484 --> 01:26:57,945
Here, last week they found
this couple out in California.

577
01:26:58,029 --> 01:27:01,782
They rent out rooms to old people,
kill 'em, bury 'em in the yard,

578
01:27:01,825 --> 01:27:04,118
cash their Social Security checks.

579
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:08,329
Oh, they'd torture 'em first.
I don't know why.

580
01:27:09,498 --> 01:27:11,624
Maybe their television set was broke.

581
01:27:11,709 --> 01:27:15,087
And this went on until, here, I quote,

582
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:19,049
"Neighbors were alerted
when a man ran from the premises

583
01:27:19,134 --> 01:27:21,135
wearing only a dog collar. "

584
01:27:22,847 --> 01:27:25,849
You can't make up such
a thing as that. I dare you to try.

585
01:27:25,933 --> 01:27:29,643
But that's what it took, you notice,
to get somebody's attention.

586
01:27:29,686 --> 01:27:32,438
Digging graves in the backyard
didn't bring any.

587
01:27:39,155 --> 01:27:42,866
Well, that's all right.
I laugh myself sometimes.

588
01:27:44,994 --> 01:27:46,995
Ain't a whole lot else you can do.

589
01:27:49,623 --> 01:27:51,623
Tell me something.

590
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:54,668
Who gets through this gate
into the United States?

591
01:27:56,463 --> 01:27:59,007
I don't know. American citizens?

592
01:27:59,049 --> 01:28:01,968
Some American citizens.
Who do you think decides?

593
01:28:02,011 --> 01:28:04,012
- You do, I reckon.
- That is correct.

594
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:06,390
- How do I decide?
- I don't know.

595
01:28:06,475 --> 01:28:10,394
I ask questions. If I get sensible
answers, then they get to go to America.

596
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:11,854
If I don't, they don't.

597
01:28:11,897 --> 01:28:13,980
- Anything you don't understand?
- No.

598
01:28:14,023 --> 01:28:16,691
I ask again, how you come
to be here with no clothes?

599
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:19,694
Well, I got an overcoat on.

600
01:28:20,946 --> 01:28:22,864
- Are you jacking with me?
- No, sir.

601
01:28:22,948 --> 01:28:25,033
- Don't jack with me.
- Yes, sir.

602
01:28:25,618 --> 01:28:27,827
- You in the service?
- No, I'm a veteran.

603
01:28:27,870 --> 01:28:30,372
- 'Nam?
- Yes, sir, two tours.

604
01:28:30,415 --> 01:28:33,043
- What outfit?
- Twelfth Infantry Battalion,

605
01:28:33,085 --> 01:28:36,713
August 7th, 1966, July 2nd, 1968.

606
01:28:39,382 --> 01:28:42,343
- Wilson!
- Yes, sir!

607
01:28:42,385 --> 01:28:45,971
Get someone to help this man.
He needs to get into town.

608
01:28:54,982 --> 01:28:58,401
- How those Larry's holdin' up?
- Good, good.

609
01:28:58,486 --> 01:29:01,070
- I need everything else.
- OK.

610
01:29:01,613 --> 01:29:04,740
Have a lot of people come
in here without any clothes on?

611
01:29:04,783 --> 01:29:07,118
No, sir. It's unusual.

612
01:29:20,092 --> 01:29:23,593
<i>- She don't want to talk to you.
- Yes, she does. Put her on.</i>

613
01:29:23,678 --> 01:29:26,221
<i>- Do you know what time it is?
- I don't care,</i>

614
01:29:26,264 --> 01:29:28,598
and don't you hang up this phone.

615
01:29:28,641 --> 01:29:31,810
<i>Discombobulated
by a no-account son-in-law.</i>

616
01:29:32,979 --> 01:29:34,855
<i>- Llewelyn?
- Hey, you.</i>

617
01:29:34,939 --> 01:29:38,108
<i>- What should I do?
- You know what's going on?</i>

618
01:29:38,150 --> 01:29:41,904
I don't know. I had the sheriff here
from Terrell County. He...

619
01:29:41,947 --> 01:29:45,284
<i>- What'd you tell him?
- What did I know to tell him?</i>

620
01:29:45,952 --> 01:29:49,120
<i>You're hurt, ain't you?</i>

621
01:29:49,204 --> 01:29:51,455
What makes you say that?

622
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:55,126
<i>- I can hear it in your voice.
- It's falseness in his voice!</i>

623
01:29:55,168 --> 01:29:58,796
Look, I want you to meet me at
the Desert Sands Motel in El Paso.

624
01:29:58,839 --> 01:30:01,299
I'm gonna give you the money,
put you on a plane.

625
01:30:01,383 --> 01:30:03,801
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna
leave you in the lurch.

626
01:30:03,886 --> 01:30:07,096
This works better. With you
gone and I don't have the money,

627
01:30:07,139 --> 01:30:09,974
he can't touch me,
but I can sure touch him.

628
01:30:10,017 --> 01:30:12,685
And after I find him,
I'll come and join you.

629
01:30:12,769 --> 01:30:16,231
<i>Find who?
What am I supposed to do with mother?</i>

630
01:30:16,316 --> 01:30:18,191
<i>- She'll be all right.
- All right?</i>

631
01:30:18,276 --> 01:30:20,819
<i>Be all right? I got the cancer!</i>

632
01:30:20,862 --> 01:30:22,821
Ain't nobody gonna bother her.

633
01:30:57,398 --> 01:30:58,899
Who are you?

634
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,114
- Me?
- Yes.

635
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:07,367
Nobody.

636
01:31:07,451 --> 01:31:09,160
Accounting.

637
01:31:10,579 --> 01:31:13,039
He gave the Mexicans a receiver.

638
01:31:15,376 --> 01:31:17,377
He feels...

639
01:31:17,419 --> 01:31:21,046
He felt that the more people looking...

640
01:31:21,130 --> 01:31:26,053
That's foolish.
You pick the one right tool.

641
01:31:26,137 --> 01:31:27,554
I see.

642
01:31:30,433 --> 01:31:32,059
Are you going to shoot me?

643
01:31:38,316 --> 01:31:40,109
That depends.

644
01:31:42,486 --> 01:31:44,070
Do you see me?

645
01:31:47,241 --> 01:31:49,827
I always seen this
is what it'd come to.

646
01:31:49,911 --> 01:31:54,206
- Three years ago, I pre-visioned it.
- It ain't three years we been married.

647
01:31:54,249 --> 01:31:58,460
Three years ago I said
them very words, "no" and "good. "

648
01:31:58,545 --> 01:32:02,215
Here we are, 90 degree heat,

649
01:32:02,258 --> 01:32:07,678
I got the cancer and look at this,
not even a home to go to.

650
01:32:08,388 --> 01:32:11,181
We're going to El Paso, Texas.

651
01:32:11,266 --> 01:32:14,436
You know how may people
I know in El Paso, Texas?

652
01:32:14,478 --> 01:32:17,439
- No, ma'am.
- That's how many.

653
01:32:26,365 --> 01:32:29,616
- I didn't see my prednisone.
- I put it in, Mama.

654
01:32:29,659 --> 01:32:33,412
- Well, I didn't see it.
- Well, I put it in that one.

655
01:32:33,455 --> 01:32:37,292
You just set there. I'll get tickets
and a cart for the bags.

656
01:32:37,376 --> 01:32:39,545
You need help with the bags, madam?

657
01:32:39,629 --> 01:32:43,507
Well, thank God, there is
one gentleman left in west Texas.

658
01:32:43,592 --> 01:32:46,343
Yes, thank you.
I am old and I am not well!

659
01:32:46,428 --> 01:32:51,140
- Which bus are you taking?
- Going to El Paso, don't ask me why.

660
01:32:51,183 --> 01:32:54,142
It's not often you see
a Mexican in a suit.

661
01:32:54,185 --> 01:32:56,770
You go to El Paso? I know it.
Where are you staying?

662
01:32:56,812 --> 01:32:58,146
Oh...

663
01:32:58,189 --> 01:32:59,981
<i>Carla Jean, how are you?</i>

664
01:33:00,024 --> 01:33:04,028
Sheriff, was that a true story
about Charlie Walser?

665
01:33:04,112 --> 01:33:06,614
<i>Who's Charlie Walser? Oh...</i>

666
01:33:08,825 --> 01:33:11,411
True story.
I couldn't swear to every detail,

667
01:33:11,496 --> 01:33:14,997
<i>- but it's certainly true it is a story.
- Yeah, right.</i>

668
01:33:15,082 --> 01:33:18,918
Sheriff, can you give me
your word on something?

669
01:33:19,002 --> 01:33:20,920
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

670
01:33:21,004 --> 01:33:25,633
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed,
you promise it'll be just you

671
01:33:25,675 --> 01:33:28,844
who goes and talks with him?
You and nobody else.

672
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:32,849
<i>- Yes, ma'am, I do.
- Llewelyn would never ask for help.</i>

673
01:33:32,934 --> 01:33:35,811
He never thinks he needs any.

674
01:33:35,853 --> 01:33:39,772
<i>Carla Jean, I will not harm your man.</i>

675
01:33:39,856 --> 01:33:43,275
<i>And he needs help,
whether he knows it or not.</i>

676
01:33:52,203 --> 01:33:54,330
What's the problem there, neighbor?

677
01:33:54,373 --> 01:33:58,751
Yep, that'll suck some power, over time.

678
01:34:00,546 --> 01:34:04,339
- You from around here?
- Yeah, Alpine, born and bred.

679
01:34:04,382 --> 01:34:08,468
- Here you go.
- What airport would you use?

680
01:34:08,553 --> 01:34:12,722
- Well, airport or airstrip?
- Airport.

681
01:34:12,807 --> 01:34:16,560
- Well, where you goin'?
- I don't know.

682
01:34:16,644 --> 01:34:21,108
Just lightin' out for the territories,
Brother, I been there.

683
01:34:21,651 --> 01:34:24,902
Well, there's airstrips.

684
01:34:24,945 --> 01:34:27,280
The airport is El Paso.

685
01:34:27,364 --> 01:34:29,157
If you want someplace specific,

686
01:34:29,241 --> 01:34:33,202
you might could be better offjust
driving to Dallas, not have to connect.

687
01:34:33,245 --> 01:34:35,454
You gonna clamp them, buddy?

688
01:34:35,539 --> 01:34:38,416
Can you get those chicken crates
out of the bed?

689
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:41,377
What are you talking about?

690
01:34:57,270 --> 01:35:01,273
Hey, Mr. Sportin' Goods.

691
01:35:01,357 --> 01:35:05,319
- Hey, yourself.
- You a sport?

692
01:35:05,403 --> 01:35:07,779
Yeah, that's me.

693
01:35:07,864 --> 01:35:10,657
I got beers in my room.

694
01:35:10,742 --> 01:35:14,620
- Oh, I'm... I'm waiting on my wife.
- Oh.

695
01:35:14,704 --> 01:35:17,539
That's who you keep
looking out the window for?

696
01:35:17,624 --> 01:35:20,250
- Well, half.
- What else then?

697
01:35:20,293 --> 01:35:25,130
- Just looking for what's comin'.
- Yeah.

698
01:35:25,215 --> 01:35:27,925
But no one ever sees that.

699
01:35:27,968 --> 01:35:31,304
Beer! That's what's comin'.

700
01:35:31,347 --> 01:35:34,140
I'll bring the ice chest out.
You can stay married.

701
01:35:34,225 --> 01:35:36,726
No, ma'am, I know what beer leads to.

702
01:35:38,562 --> 01:35:40,688
Beer leads to more beer.

703
01:36:27,612 --> 01:36:29,071
You all right?

704
01:36:34,369 --> 01:36:36,203
Call the police.

705
01:36:42,044 --> 01:36:44,336
Your local law enforcement.

706
01:36:45,672 --> 01:36:47,673
I'm not on their radio.

707
01:36:47,716 --> 01:36:50,468
I met his daughter at the...

708
01:37:37,933 --> 01:37:41,103
Buy you a cup of coffee
'fore you drive home?

709
01:37:41,188 --> 01:37:44,774
- No money in his room there?
- Couple hundred, on his person.

710
01:37:44,816 --> 01:37:47,152
Those hombres
would have taken the stash.

711
01:37:47,236 --> 01:37:49,780
I suppose so.

712
01:37:49,864 --> 01:37:52,032
Though they was leavin' in a hurry.

713
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:57,286
It's all the goddamn money, Ed Tom.
Money and the drugs.

714
01:37:58,455 --> 01:38:01,123
It's just goddamn beyond everything.

715
01:38:01,875 --> 01:38:05,128
What's it mean? What's it leading to?

716
01:38:05,171 --> 01:38:08,256
You know,
if you'd have told me 20 years ago

717
01:38:08,299 --> 01:38:11,468
I'd see children walking
the streets of our Texas towns

718
01:38:11,511 --> 01:38:14,638
with green hair, bones in their noses,

719
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:17,306
I just flat-out
wouldn't have believed you.

720
01:38:17,349 --> 01:38:18,933
Signs and wonders.

721
01:38:18,975 --> 01:38:23,563
But I think once you quit hearing "sir"
and "ma'am," the rest is soon to foller.

722
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:25,357
- Oh, it's the tide.
- Yeah.

723
01:38:25,441 --> 01:38:29,278
It's the dismal tide.
It is not the one thing.

724
01:38:29,321 --> 01:38:30,947
Not the one thing.

725
01:38:30,989 --> 01:38:33,866
Yeah, well,
none of that explains your man, though.

726
01:38:33,951 --> 01:38:37,078
Well, he's just a goddamn
homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.

727
01:38:37,162 --> 01:38:40,497
- I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
- Well, what would you call him?

728
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:43,959
Well, sometimes
I think he's pretty much a ghost.

729
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:45,961
- He's real, all right.
- Oh, yeah?

730
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:49,798
Yeah. All of that over at
the Eagle Hotel? Just beyond everything.

731
01:38:49,841 --> 01:38:52,426
Yeah. Got some hard bark on him.

732
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:55,388
Why... Well, that don't hardly say it.

733
01:38:56,599 --> 01:38:58,434
He shoots a desk clerk one day,

734
01:38:58,518 --> 01:39:03,020
walks right back in the next
and shoots a retired Army colonel.

735
01:39:03,063 --> 01:39:04,564
It's hard to believe.

736
01:39:04,648 --> 01:39:07,900
Just strolls right back
into a crime scene.

737
01:39:07,985 --> 01:39:13,364
Now, who'd do such a thing?
How do you defend against it?

738
01:39:13,407 --> 01:39:16,409
Well, good trip, Ed Tom.

739
01:39:16,493 --> 01:39:18,871
Sorry we couldn't help your boy.

740
01:42:51,005 --> 01:42:54,256
- In back!
- How'd you know I was here?

741
01:42:54,299 --> 01:42:57,426
Who else'd be driving up in your truck?

742
01:42:57,469 --> 01:42:59,053
- You heard it?
- How's that?

743
01:42:59,096 --> 01:43:03,308
Did you hear my...?
You're having fun with me.

744
01:43:03,393 --> 01:43:07,772
What give you that idea?
I seen one of the cats heard it.

745
01:43:07,815 --> 01:43:12,610
- How'd you know it was my truck?
- I deduced it when you walked in.

746
01:43:12,695 --> 01:43:14,862
How many of them things you got now?

747
01:43:14,947 --> 01:43:17,447
Cats? Oh, I don't know, several.

748
01:43:17,532 --> 01:43:20,826
Well, it depends
on what you mean by "got. "

749
01:43:20,910 --> 01:43:25,122
Some of 'em are half wild,
some of 'em are just outlaws.

750
01:43:28,209 --> 01:43:31,963
- How you been, Ellis?
- You're looking at it.

751
01:43:33,298 --> 01:43:36,635
I got to say, you're looking older.

752
01:43:36,678 --> 01:43:38,220
I am older.

753
01:43:39,347 --> 01:43:41,806
Got a letter from your wife.

754
01:43:41,890 --> 01:43:46,310
She writes me pretty regular,
keeps me up on the family news.

755
01:43:46,395 --> 01:43:50,106
- Didn't know there was any.
- Told me you're quittin'.

756
01:43:53,152 --> 01:43:56,071
- You want a cup?
- Appreciate it.

757
01:44:03,579 --> 01:44:05,413
How fresh is that coffee?

758
01:44:05,497 --> 01:44:11,211
I generally make a fresh pot every week,
even if there's some left over.

759
01:44:13,173 --> 01:44:15,507
That man that shot you died in prison?

760
01:44:17,844 --> 01:44:20,096
Angola. Yeah.

761
01:44:20,181 --> 01:44:22,974
What'd you done he'd a been released?

762
01:44:23,017 --> 01:44:25,935
Oh, I don't know. Nothing.

763
01:44:26,020 --> 01:44:27,644
Wouldn't be no point in it.

764
01:44:27,687 --> 01:44:30,981
Kindly surprised to hear you say that.

765
01:44:31,024 --> 01:44:34,777
Well, all the time
you spend trying to get back

766
01:44:34,861 --> 01:44:38,530
what's been took from you,
more is going out the door.

767
01:44:38,573 --> 01:44:41,533
After a while, you have
to try to get a tourniquet on it.

768
01:44:42,619 --> 01:44:46,749
Your granddad never asked me
to sign on as a deputy.

769
01:44:49,543 --> 01:44:53,588
Loretta tells me you're quittin'.
How come you doing that?

770
01:44:53,672 --> 01:44:55,965
I don't know.

771
01:44:58,677 --> 01:45:00,345
I feel overmatched.

772
01:45:04,892 --> 01:45:07,519
I always figured when I got older,

773
01:45:07,561 --> 01:45:12,483
God would... sort of
come into my life somehow.

774
01:45:15,486 --> 01:45:16,569
And He didn't.

775
01:45:20,408 --> 01:45:22,076
And I don't blame Him.

776
01:45:24,412 --> 01:45:27,373
If I was Him, I'd have
the same opinion of me that He does.

777
01:45:27,999 --> 01:45:29,792
You don't know what He thinks.

778
01:45:44,015 --> 01:45:47,768
I sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster and badge
over to the Rangers,

779
01:45:47,811 --> 01:45:50,437
put it in their museum.

780
01:45:50,522 --> 01:45:54,150
Your daddy ever tell you
how Uncle Mac come to his reward?

781
01:45:55,236 --> 01:45:58,781
Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.

782
01:46:01,033 --> 01:46:05,912
Seven or eight of 'em come up there,
all wanting this, wanting that.

783
01:46:05,955 --> 01:46:08,957
Uncle Mac went back in the house
to get the shotgun.

784
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:12,627
Well, they was ahead of him.

785
01:46:12,712 --> 01:46:15,463
Shot him in his doorway.

786
01:46:15,506 --> 01:46:18,133
Aunt Ella come out,
tried to stop the bleeding.

787
01:46:18,175 --> 01:46:22,136
Uncle Mac all the while
trying to get that shotgun.

788
01:46:22,178 --> 01:46:26,641
They just sat there on their horses,
watching him die.

789
01:46:27,727 --> 01:46:31,898
After a while, one of 'em said
something in Indian and they turned.

790
01:46:32,816 --> 01:46:34,609
Left out.

791
01:46:36,778 --> 01:46:40,281
Uncle Mac knew the score,
even ifAunt Ella didn't.

792
01:46:40,324 --> 01:46:43,492
Shot through the left lung.

793
01:46:43,535 --> 01:46:48,079
And that was that... as they say.

794
01:46:51,335 --> 01:46:52,668
When'd he die?

795
01:46:53,921 --> 01:46:57,298
Nineteen zero and, nine?

796
01:46:57,341 --> 01:47:01,177
No, I mean,
was it right away or in the night or...

797
01:47:01,261 --> 01:47:04,973
- When was it?
- I believe it was that night.

798
01:47:05,016 --> 01:47:10,061
She buried him the next morning.
Digging in that hard old caliche.

799
01:47:13,023 --> 01:47:15,776
What you got ain't nothin' new.

800
01:47:16,903 --> 01:47:19,613
This country is hard on people.

801
01:47:23,368 --> 01:47:25,494
You can't stop what's coming.

802
01:47:27,288 --> 01:47:29,373
It ain't all waitin' on you.

803
01:47:32,209 --> 01:47:34,043
That's vanity.

804
01:48:34,983 --> 01:48:37,359
I knew this wasn't done with.

805
01:48:40,196 --> 01:48:42,113
I ain't got the money.

806
01:48:44,116 --> 01:48:48,370
What little I had is long gone
and there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

807
01:48:50,290 --> 01:48:54,836
I buried my mother today.
Ain't paid for that neither.

808
01:48:55,838 --> 01:48:57,714
I wouldn't worry about it.

809
01:49:00,342 --> 01:49:01,926
I need to sit down.

810
01:49:17,192 --> 01:49:19,319
You got no cause to hurt me.

811
01:49:19,361 --> 01:49:23,199
No. But I gave my word.

812
01:49:24,659 --> 01:49:28,286
- You gave your word?
- To your husband.

813
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:34,042
That don't make sense.

814
01:49:34,126 --> 01:49:37,337
You gave your word
to my husband to kill me?

815
01:49:37,421 --> 01:49:40,924
Your husband had
the opportunity to save you.

816
01:49:41,008 --> 01:49:43,844
Instead, he used you
to try to save himself.

817
01:49:48,850 --> 01:49:50,850
Not like that.

818
01:49:52,436 --> 01:49:54,270
Not like you say.

819
01:50:00,362 --> 01:50:02,154
You don't have to do this.

820
01:50:02,197 --> 01:50:04,490
People always say the same thing.

821
01:50:06,201 --> 01:50:07,493
What do they say?

822
01:50:08,579 --> 01:50:10,831
They say, "You don't have to do this. "

823
01:50:11,999 --> 01:50:17,044
- You don't.
- OK.

824
01:50:22,175 --> 01:50:24,176
This is the best I can do.

825
01:50:25,262 --> 01:50:26,262
Call it.

826
01:50:30,767 --> 01:50:34,397
I knowed you was crazy
when I saw you sitting there.

827
01:50:36,774 --> 01:50:39,401
I knowed exactly
what was in store for me.

828
01:50:39,485 --> 01:50:43,822
- Call it.
- No.

829
01:50:43,906 --> 01:50:46,408
I ain't gonna call it.

830
01:50:49,787 --> 01:50:51,204
Call it.

831
01:50:51,247 --> 01:50:54,332
The coin don't have no say.

832
01:50:54,417 --> 01:50:56,251
It's just you.

833
01:50:58,797 --> 01:51:01,923
Well, I got here
the same way the coin did.

834
01:52:44,530 --> 01:52:47,699
Mister, you got
a bone sticking out of your arm.

835
01:52:47,741 --> 01:52:50,160
I'm all right.
Let me just sit here a minute.

836
01:52:50,203 --> 01:52:53,163
There's an ambulance coming.
The man went to call.

837
01:52:53,206 --> 01:52:55,541
All right.

838
01:52:55,583 --> 01:52:59,419
Are you all right?
You got a bone sticking out your arm.

839
01:53:00,713 --> 01:53:02,672
What'll you take for the shirt?

840
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:10,222
Well, hell, mister,
I'll give you my shirt.

841
01:53:17,230 --> 01:53:20,690
Look at that fucking bone.

842
01:53:20,733 --> 01:53:21,899
Tie this for me.

843
01:53:23,027 --> 01:53:24,987
Just tie it, just tie it.

844
01:53:43,006 --> 01:53:47,051
Hell, mister.
Look, I don't mind helping someone out.

845
01:53:47,093 --> 01:53:49,595
- That's a lot of money.
- Take it.

846
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:52,806
Take it and... you didn't see me.

847
01:53:52,891 --> 01:53:55,143
I was already gone.

848
01:53:55,227 --> 01:53:56,519
Yes, sir.

849
01:54:00,942 --> 01:54:04,445
- Part of that's mine, right?
- You still got your damn shirt.

850
01:54:04,529 --> 01:54:08,948
- Ain't even what it was for.
- Maybe. But I'm still out a shirt.

851
01:54:29,053 --> 01:54:31,679
- Maybe I'll go ridin'.
- OK.

852
01:54:31,764 --> 01:54:35,643
- What do you think?
- Well, I can't plan your day.

853
01:54:36,895 --> 01:54:40,439
- I mean, would you care to join me?
- Lord, no, I'm not retired.

854
01:54:42,484 --> 01:54:46,863
- Maybe I'll help out here then.
- Better not.

855
01:54:51,160 --> 01:54:54,495
- How'd you sleep?
- I don't know. Had dreams.

856
01:54:54,579 --> 01:54:58,958
Well, you got time for 'em now.
Anything interesting?

857
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,836
They always is to the party concerned.

858
01:55:04,089 --> 01:55:06,674
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

859
01:55:09,138 --> 01:55:14,225
All right, then. Two of 'em, both
had my father in 'em. It's peculiar.

860
01:55:14,309 --> 01:55:17,310
I'm older now
than he ever was by 20 years.

861
01:55:17,353 --> 01:55:21,231
So, in a sense, he's the younger man.

862
01:55:21,315 --> 01:55:24,401
Anyway, the first one
I don't remember too well,

863
01:55:24,485 --> 01:55:27,195
but it was about meeting him in town,

864
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:29,865
somewheres,
and he give me some money.

865
01:55:29,949 --> 01:55:31,575
I think I lost it.

866
01:55:33,370 --> 01:55:38,290
Second one, it was like we
was both back in older times.

867
01:55:38,374 --> 01:55:42,461
And I was a-horseback,
going through the mountains of a night.

868
01:55:42,545 --> 01:55:45,965
Going through this pass
in the mountains.

869
01:55:46,049 --> 01:55:49,427
It was cold,
and there was snow on the ground.

870
01:55:49,511 --> 01:55:51,971
And he rode past me and kept on going,

871
01:55:52,055 --> 01:55:54,807
never said nothing going by,
just rode on past.

872
01:55:56,435 --> 01:56:00,230
He had his blanket wrapped around him
and his head down.

873
01:56:02,065 --> 01:56:06,068
When he rode past,
I seen he was carrying fire in a horn,

874
01:56:06,111 --> 01:56:08,029
the way people used to do, and I...

875
01:56:08,071 --> 01:56:10,698
I could see the horn
from the light inside of it,

876
01:56:10,741 --> 01:56:12,492
'bout the color of the moon.

877
01:56:13,994 --> 01:56:16,329
And, in the dream, I knew that he was...

878
01:56:17,206 --> 01:56:18,999
...going on ahead.

879
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:24,463
He was fixin' to make a fire somewhere
out there in all that dark and cold.

880
01:56:28,092 --> 01:56:31,094
And I knew that whenever I got there,
he'd be there.

881
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:37,601
And then I woke up.
