1
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,811
Babe.

2
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,980
Please don't smoke.
It'll kill your palate.

3
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,190
Then my palate will die happy.

4
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:06,900
Hey.

5
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:10,362
Margot, tonight is huge, okay?

6
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,864
The flavor profiles,
it's all super delicate.

7
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:15,534
When you smoke, you ruin your ability
to be able to appreciate them.

8
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,618
Oh, come on!

9
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,745
Please. Please.

10
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,127
Fine. Jesus.

11
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,838
Thank you.

12
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,840
Oh! Thank God.

13
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,175
Is that gonna fit everyone?

14
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,511
Yeah, easily.
Twelve customers total.

15
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:35,804
A night?

16
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,306
How do they turn a profit?

17
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,266
$1,250 a head. That's how.

18
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,268
You're fucking kidding, right?

19
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,728
What, are we eating a Rolex?

20
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,938
Come on, let's not ruin this
by talking price, yeah?

21
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,523
Just go with the flow.

22
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,774
Let it be magical.

23
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,444
- Hey, it's your dime.
- Mmm.

24
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,112
- Not bad!
- Oh, thanks, man.

25
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,280
You deserve this, baby.

26
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,781
You know who's gonna love this? Betty!

27
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,701
It's just a "fuck you" to Accounts.

28
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,036
It's not even a client dinner.

29
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,787
Fuck. We're dicks, huh?

30
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:04,333
Great. A power tasting.

31
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,126
They'll be wasted by the amuse.

32
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,252
- Hi, guys.
- By boat.

33
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:09,087
How did you think we were
gonna get on the...

34
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:13,216
Look at you on a gangplank in heels.

35
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,676
Fuck.

36
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,850
Holy fucking shit.

37
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,770
Lillian Bloom. Oh, my God.

38
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,563
Who's Lillian Bloom?

39
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,106
Food critic for <i>Saveur.</i>

40
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,484
She basically discovered Slowik.

41
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:32,694
Okay, well, it's official.

42
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,404
Tonight will be madness.

43
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,660
All aboard for Hawthorn!

44
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,871
Hawthorn! All aboard!

45
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:43,955
Wow.

46
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,165
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

47
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,835
<i>please make yourselves comfortable
for our short journey to Hawthorn Island.</i>

48
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,253
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- Ahoy!

49
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:51,963
And avast, me hearties!

50
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,674
Let's hope she's seaworthy, eh?

51
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,050
Yes, sir. Yeah.

52
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,511
Boat... Boat jokes.

53
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,804
- Yeah, yeah.
- Boat, yeah.

54
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,055
- We're on a boat.
- Yeah. We're on a boat.

55
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,642
Hey, we got
a famous person on board, huh?

56
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,893
FP in the house.

57
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,062
Barely F anymore,
though. It's not 1998.

58
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,313
He's a P, and he's F.

59
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,731
Oh, my God. Check it out.

60
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,983
Hey, aren't you supposed
to be running interference for me?

61
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,443
Make sure people don't bother me, then?

62
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,112
God, we both know you were not bothered.

63
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,822
I saw all his movies
when I was a kid.

64
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:17,906
Hey, listen.

65
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,659
Apparently, he's a big foodie.
You know, thinks he is.

66
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,035
Chef Slowik
would like to welcome you

67
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,579
with a raw local oyster
in a mignonette emulsion,

68
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,207
with lemon caviar
and an oyster leaf. Enjoy.

69
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,667
- Beautiful. Thank you.
- Thank you.

70
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,127
It's one of his classics. Mmm-mmm.

71
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,255
The lemon pearls are made with alginate.

72
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,383
Alginate, as in, um...

73
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,634
As in algae. Come on.

74
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,428
Right, yeah.

75
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,929
- Pond scum.
- It's not...

76
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,055
Delicious.

77
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,651
Oh, my God.

78
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,361
It's laughable.

79
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,822
It's actually fucking laughably good.

80
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,283
- It's good.
- Mmm.

81
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,161
Think I prefer just the oyster, though.
Love oysters.

82
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,371
No. No. It's the balance of the products.

83
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,165
You need the mouth feel of the mignonette.

84
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,000
Please don't say "mouth feel."

85
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,835
Too late. Mouthfeel.

86
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,855
Hi.

87
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,523
Thank you.

88
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,317
Jesus, this is like prom.

89
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,569
Yeah? I never went to prom.

90
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,362
Really? Why not?

91
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,865
'Cause none of the cool girls
like you said, "Yes."

92
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,950
Aw, poor baby.

93
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,953
Well, fuck those bitches.

94
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,288
- Bryce.
- Welcome.

95
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,748
Welcome, Mr. Lorimer.

96
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,794
- Hello. Felicity Lynn.
- Hello. Good evening.

97
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,754
- And Damien Garcia.
- And Mr. George Diaz.

98
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,547
- Mr. Diaz. Welcome.
- You gave my real name?

99
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:58,632
Of course I gave them your real name.

100
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,841
- What about the paparazzi?
- It's a pleasure to have you.

101
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:00,926
Paparazzi? We're on an island.

102
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,052
Of course I gave them your real name.

103
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,220
Welcome to Hawthorn.

104
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,348
Mr. Ledford and Miss Westervelt?

105
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:08,767
Oh, no. Um...

106
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,560
Sorry, yeah, no. That was, uh...

107
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,938
That's not Miss...
She had a change of plans,

108
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,148
so Miss Westervelt couldn't...
This is Miss...

109
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,234
I'm Margot.

110
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,152
Hi. Nice to meet you.

111
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,784
Margot. Welcome.

112
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,746
We'll endeavor to make your evening
as pleasant as possible.

113
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,540
- Thanks.
- Right this way.

114
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:32,624
Thanks.

115
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,210
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

116
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,003
That was really awkward.
I'm sorry. That was not...

117
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,880
No, no. Fine.

118
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:39,965
Don't worry about it.

119
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,133
Sorry.

120
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,973
Mr. Leibrandt.
Mrs. Leibrandt. Welcome.

121
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,183
We'll just go straight
to the restaurant, if you don't mind.

122
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,853
We've seen the tour
many, many times.

123
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,187
Yes, yes, you have.

124
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:58,191
My esteemed guests
can continue their conversation this way.

125
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,402
Thank you. Please follow me.

126
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,655
So, like, what are you working on now?

127
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,074
Oh, hey, thanks for asking.
See, people still know me.

128
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,910
I'm moving into
the presenter phase of my career.

129
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,453
You know? Do me.

130
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:19,379
Hawthorn Island
comprises 12 acres of forest and pasture.

131
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,007
We have the bounty
of the sea surrounding us.

132
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,091
Oh, yeah, right.

133
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,386
Out there, right now,
we are harvesting scallops.

134
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,512
You'll eat them tonight.

135
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,556
- No, get out. Oh, shoot!
- Yes.

136
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,474
Hey!

137
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,894
Hey, harvest harder, me dude!

138
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:35,312
We're starving!

139
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:37,898
Oh, my goodness.

140
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:41,902
I do like the sense of it
being a sort of bio me of culinary ideas.

141
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,446
Right. Like, it functions like
an epicurean salon.

142
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,865
No, I like bio me better I think.

143
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,408
Biome's better. Yeah, yeah.
I mean, that's... Yeah.

144
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,786
We have reached
the base camp of Mount Bullshit.

145
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,121
This is insane.

146
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,005
Smell that.

147
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,673
Mmm.

148
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:07,886
We're gonna be hungry.

149
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,512
Yeah, I'm a huge
embarrassing foodie.

150
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,680
I love this stuff.

151
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,807
And I'm close, personal
friends with the chef.

152
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,017
Okay, player.

153
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,728
Our smokehouse
is in the Nordic tradition.

154
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,898
We use the meat of dairy cows only,

155
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:26,863
which we age for an astonishing 152 days
to relax the protein strands.

156
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,199
- Ah, yes. Yes.
- Can we pop in here?

157
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,826
- Dude, I read about one of these online.
- Oh, yeah? Can I check it out?

158
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,953
- Korean barbeque.
- Yes.

159
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,372
But please, do not touch our proteins.
They're immature.

160
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,291
So, what happens if
you serve it on the 153rd day?

161
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,460
Does all hell break loose, or...

162
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,129
Well, I suppose the bacteria
would introduce itself

163
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,716
to the consumer's bloodstream
and spread into their spinal membranes,

164
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,302
after which point, he or she
would become incapacitated

165
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,096
and shortly thereafter expire.

166
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,390
So, yes, all hell would break loose.

167
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,602
Good thing we're pros, yes?

168
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:00,814
I'd like to work for her.

169
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:01,898
- Yeah.
- Cool.

170
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,274
This is where we live.

171
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:08,238
Yeah? What, you actually live here?
All of you?

172
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,864
All of us.

173
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,116
Except Chef.

174
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,867
- Yeah, well...
- Oof.

175
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,120
<i>Esprit de corps.</i> No?

176
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,123
No, Mr. Feldman.
It's very much more than that.

177
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,291
Here we are family.

178
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,294
Each day starts at 6:00,
with five hours of prep work.

179
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,338
We harvest. We ferment.

180
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,716
We slaughter. We marinate.

181
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,301
We liquify. We spherify.

182
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,928
We gel.

183
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,596
- They, um... They "gel?"
- Yeah.

184
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,681
We gel.

185
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,101
Dinner is typically
four hours and 25 minutes.

186
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,103
Each day ends at well past
2:00 in the morning.

187
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,730
So yes, it's best that we all live here.

188
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,356
You guys ever get burned out, or...

189
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,860
- "Burned out?"
- Yeah, sorry, sorry.

190
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,654
Like, tired of doing the same thing?

191
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,699
Chef holds himself
to the highest standard, and so do we.

192
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,620
We never burn anything unless by design,
to make delicious.

193
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,540
Now, who's hungry?

194
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,917
There is food
at the end of this, right?

195
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,627
Boat food to dinner table.

196
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,004
Elsa.

197
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,130
Excuse me.

198
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,965
Elsa. Elsa, hi.

199
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,050
Uh, who lives there?

200
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,634
Chef.

201
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,969
Oh, can we see that?

202
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,266
Even we are not allowed
inside Chefs cottage, Mr. Ledford.

203
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,146
Come on.

204
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,399
We mustn't disturb
the Lord High Emperor of Sustenance.

205
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,233
Yeah, all right.

206
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,070
Isn't the GOAT the greatest of
all time, though?

207
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,571
No, no, no. Back in the day...

208
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,740
You think he'd pick that big guy?

209
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,289
So, I think that maybe
we'll just time the post.

210
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,124
Oh, yeah? Bring you to the best spots?

211
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,584
Yes, well,
I book the best spots.

212
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,794
- So you tell me.
- With my name.

213
00:09:45,877 --> 00:09:46,920
Well, I...

214
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,131
Hi, again.

215
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,382
Gentlemen, parfait?

216
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,676
Oh! Look at that view.

217
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:55,762
Wanna take a picture?

218
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,489
Where we going, chief?

219
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,783
Here. Switch seats with me.

220
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,202
- Miss...
- Mills.

221
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,539
Ms. Mills. You will be sitting
in Miss Westervelt's seat.

222
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,666
Just...
You should have the better view.

223
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,876
Well, I don't...

224
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,378
I don't need a better view.

225
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,462
No,
I'm gonna look at the kitchen.

226
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,881
- Thank you!
- The rosé, we'll get first.

227
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:32,966
Enjoy.

228
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:45,353
Feel free to observe
the cooks as they innovate.

229
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:51,401
But please, do not photograph our dishes.

230
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,445
Chef strongly feels that
the beauty in his creations

231
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,364
lies in their ephemeral nature.

232
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,866
Here, come on. We can't miss this.

233
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,077
Oh. Um...

234
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,582
Do you make that with a Pacojet?

235
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,251
- Exactly right, sir.
- Mmm.

236
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:12,964
You know, a Pacojet can produce
a powderized, uh, snow-like texture.

237
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,341
- Cool.
- Yeah. I have one.

238
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,343
You really know your stuff, Mr. Ledford.

239
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,846
You know my name?

240
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,890
Oh, we like to know
everyone who dines with us.

241
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,435
And Chef, is he around here somewhere?
I'd love to talk with him.

242
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,020
Why don't you take your seat?

243
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,731
We're about to serve.

244
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,358
Oh, right. Yeah, okay. Thank you.

245
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,694
- Wow.
- More Lambrusco, madam?

246
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,113
Well, the attention
to detail, it's like, fuck!

247
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,281
And he knew my name, babe!

248
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,824
Yeah. I noticed you didn't ask his name.

249
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:40,909
Yeah, well, you know.

250
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,705
There he is.

251
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,969
Fuck me. Is he looking at me?

252
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,286
- Bland? You call that bland?
- Well, it is bland.

253
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,579
You like the winter, don't you?

254
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:27,914
- I don't actually...
- Fucking freak.

255
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,999
Here we have a compressed
and pickled cucumber melon,

256
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,085
milk snow, and charred lace.

257
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,378
- Thanks.
- Enjoy.

258
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:38,424
Oh! This ongoing obsession with snow.

259
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,969
It's officially a plague,
and no one is immune.

260
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,600
Can you taste a little goat?

261
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,686
Right at the end. A little kid.

262
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,812
She said milk.

263
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,522
I wonder.

264
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,565
- She did not say of what species.
- She did not.

265
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:55,900
I want to hear
your pitch for the show,

266
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,361
but first I would like to say "thank you"

267
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,363
for the last two years.

268
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,365
This opportunity has been, uh...

269
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,616
The best of your life?

270
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,201
Let's have to many, many, many more.

271
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,620
Come on. I'm trying to do a goodbye toast.
Can you please just let me do that?

272
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,247
- No, it ain't. No, it ain't.
- Yes, it is.

273
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,165
- I'm starting a new position.
- Oh, my God!

274
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,042
My mom got me a job at Sony.

275
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,419
I told you this two weeks ago.

276
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,337
Here's my, uh, work phone.

277
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,339
Here's the production
company's credit card.

278
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,757
What are you doin'? Non-transferrable.

279
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:22,093
And here is the key to your house in LA...

280
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,178
- I don't have pockets.
- ...your apartment in New York

281
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,347
and your other apartment in New York
that your wife doesn't know about.

282
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,515
How's Amanda?

283
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,599
Take it because
I won't be there on Monday.

284
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,435
We're doing this?

285
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,561
The "talking about our lives" thing?

286
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,604
- Is that it? We're close?
- Hey, I don't want to either.

287
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,606
- But shouldn't we?
- Well, do we have to?

288
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,943
Well, not good, Bryce. Okay?

289
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,112
Me and Amanda are not good. It's not good.

290
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,447
Are you at fault?

291
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,157
No, it was her fault.
She made me text her coworker.

292
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,284
Yeah, fucking of course
it's my fault, bro.

293
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,577
I'm an asshole.

294
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,911
Well, at least we have work.

295
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,955
- And money.
- To work and money.

296
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,373
- Yeah, baby.
- Yeah, baby.

297
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,624
We're pathetic, aren't we?

298
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,251
Oh, my God, dude.
Somebody, shoot us.

299
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,174
No, I'm not gonna have...

300
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,759
Jesus Christ. I want to live
inside this thing.

301
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,929
Mmm. So it's okay
that I'm not as into this as you are?

302
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,056
Oh, no, no. It's good.

303
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,724
I'm sitting with the coolest girl here.

304
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,893
Okay, so what is it with this food thing?

305
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,229
I don't know. It's like,
you know how people idolize,

306
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,898
you know, athletes, and musicians,

307
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,775
- and painters, and stuff?
- Mmm-hmm.

308
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,069
Yeah, those people are idiots.
What they do, it doesn't matter.

309
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,738
They play with inflatable balls
and ukuleles and shit.

310
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,031
Chefs,

311
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,367
they play with the raw materials
of life itself.

312
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,701
And death itself. It's...

313
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,914
I mean, I've watched every fucking episode
of <i>Chef's Table two</i> or three times.

314
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,749
I've watched Slowik's 20 times.

315
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,920
I've watched him explain the exact moment
a green strawberry is perfectly unripe.

316
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,880
I've watched him plate a raw scallop

317
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,383
during its last
dying contraction of muscle.

318
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,301
It's art on the edge of the abyss,

319
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,387
which is where God works, too.
It's the same.

320
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,222
That was beautifully put, Tyler.

321
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,182
- Stop. Don't. No.
- No! I'm being serious.

322
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,602
I think I'm, um, starting to get it.

323
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,437
- Really?
- Yeah. A little.

324
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,126
Okay.

325
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,252
Yes, Chef.

326
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:45,987
Good evening.

327
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,530
Good evening.

328
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,115
- Good evening. Hello.
- Hello.

329
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,534
Welcome to Hawthorn.

330
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,578
I am Julian Slowik,

331
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,122
and tonight it'll be
our pleasure to feed you.

332
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,457
The curtain rises.

333
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:01,878
Over the next few hours
you will ingest fat,

334
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,923
salt, sugar, protein,

335
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,926
bacteria, fungi,

336
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,554
various plants and animals,

337
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,765
and, at times, entire ecosystems.

338
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,686
But I have to beg of you one thing.

339
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,812
It's just one.

340
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,565
Do not eat.

341
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:24,692
Is he serious?

342
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,319
Taste.

343
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,322
Savor.

344
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,406
Relish.

345
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,160
Consider every morsel
that you place inside your mouth.

346
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,330
Be mindful.

347
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:39,707
But do not eat.

348
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:44,212
Our menu is too precious
for that.

349
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,421
And look around you.

350
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,299
Here we are on this island.

351
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,468
Accept.

352
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,221
Accept all of it.

353
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,349
And forgive.

354
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,602
And on that note,

355
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,479
food!

356
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,065
Yeah, yeah. Bring it, bring it.

357
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,651
Here they come.

358
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,446
Oh, wow.
It's like a marching band.

359
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:17,078
Our first course
is called "The Island."

360
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,497
On your plate are plants
from around the island,

361
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,666
placed on rocks from the shore,

362
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,377
covered in barely frozen,
filtered seawater

363
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,921
which will flavor the dish as it melts.

364
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,090
You know, this is what the guy
was fishing for earlier...

365
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,174
Sorry?

366
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:32,593
Um...

367
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,387
Sorry, Chef.

368
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,849
It's perfectly all right.
Yes, they are those very same scallops.

369
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:42,311
Now, here is what you must
remember about this dish.

370
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:46,357
We, the people on this island,
are not important.

371
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:51,988
The island and the nutrients it provides
exist in their most perfect state

372
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:57,076
without us gathering them
or manipulating them, or digesting them.

373
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:01,038
What happens inside this room
is meaningless

374
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:04,166
compared to what happens
outside in nature,

375
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,752
in the soil, in the water,

376
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:08,421
in the air.

377
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,134
We are but a frightened nanosecond.

378
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,138
Nature is timeless.

379
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,558
Enjoy.

380
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,061
That's a cheery thought.

381
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,858
Are you crying?

382
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,945
It's just that I find it all very moving.

383
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,447
It's all so beautiful. I just...

384
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,240
It's almost too beautiful to eat.

385
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,160
You know,

386
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,203
the nicest restaurant
in my hometown <i>was...</i>

387
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,747
You don't think Chefs mad at me, right?

388
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:44,915
For the scallop thing?

389
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,001
You don't have to call him "Chef," Tyler.

390
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,420
I'm pretty sure he doesn't even know
about your existence.

391
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,880
I kind of want him to...

392
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,966
- Like you?
- Yeah. Kinda.

393
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,343
Tyler, you're the customer.

394
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,303
You're paying him to serve you.

395
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,306
It doesn't really matter
whether he likes you or not.

396
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,724
Right. Wait. What does that mean?

397
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,933
Mmm. Nothing.

398
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,853
Relax. Just eat your rock.

399
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,606
And to pair, from our friends
at Caroline Morey,

400
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,274
a Chassagne-Montrachet

401
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,943
premier cru from 2014.

402
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,196
Not just a single vineyard.

403
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,239
A single row of vines.

404
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,991
- Wow. Perfect.
- It's magical.

405
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,036
Thoughts?
I'm really feeling this is quite...

406
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,288
It's half-great. It's there in moments.

407
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,373
There in moments.

408
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,291
There's a neediness
to the plating, you know.

409
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,793
I mean, it's been tweezered to fuck.

410
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,170
But the flavors are there.
It's very clean.

411
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,381
It's very, um, thalassic.

412
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,300
- "Thalassic?"
- Oceanic.

413
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,219
Thalassa was the primeval
spirit of the sea.

414
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,428
Oh, Thalassa and Pontus.

415
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,305
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Correct. So, we are...

416
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,600
We're eating the ocean.

417
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:46,894
We're eating the ocean.

418
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,396
- Yeah.
- Yes.

419
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,275
- How is it?
- Mmm.

420
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,277
It's good.

421
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,405
You can't just say "good"
for the show. You have to...

422
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:58,698
You have to embellish.

423
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,617
Oh, my God. For crying out loud.
It's not brain surgery, okay?

424
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,911
- It's a goddamn travel-food show.
- I know. Okay, so then, do it.

425
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,497
Yeah, yeah. So pitch it to me.

426
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,499
- Okay, so we go to Italy, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

427
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:13,295
We shoot me in Capri pants
on a pastel green Vespa,

428
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,674
driving around to get
to some Giuseppe's farm with cheese.

429
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,135
I eat the cheese, and then...

430
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,428
There's a close-up of me.

431
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:24,306
And I close my eyes, and I fake an orgasm,
and then off to South Africa,

432
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,102
and then, I maybe...
I talk about how racism is not so cool,

433
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,062
and bingo bongo, Emmy time.

434
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,355
- That's it?
- Okay? Can I eat now?

435
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,649
That's what you're gonna pitch
to three streaming services on Monday?

436
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:34,734
Yeah. Pretty much. That's that.

437
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,777
Yeah. Jesus fucking Christ.
That's a disaster.

438
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:39,071
I don't think you can go
to South Africa with a DUI.

439
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,866
- You like this?
- The otter food?

440
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,117
Yeah. It's solid.

441
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,577
I mean,
I've had shellfish just as good

442
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,246
with my chef at home, Ricardo.
You know Ricardo. He's amazing.

443
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,706
- Incredible.
- Whatever.

444
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,416
At least we can say
we've been here, right?

445
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,835
My dad used to say
that you buy the experience.

446
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:57,298
I mean, this looks like
a suburban landscaping.

447
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:58,758
What the fuck?

448
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,346
I saw Perry at DeLaurenti's the other day.

449
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:10,770
Oh?

450
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,023
How is he?

451
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,109
You know...

452
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,652
Perry.

453
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,741
Thank you.

454
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,662
I want plating in five!

455
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:29,955
Yes, Chef!

456
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,012
Is he gonna keep doing that?

457
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:50,684
Bread has existed in some form
for over 12,000 years,

458
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,062
especially amongst the poor.

459
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,314
Flour and water.

460
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,024
What could be simpler?

461
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:02,613
Even today, grain represents
65% of all agriculture.

462
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,866
Fruits and vegetables only 6%.

463
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:12,414
Ancient Greek peasants dipped their stale,
measly bread in wine for breakfast.

464
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:15,751
And how did Jesus teach us to pray

465
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,462
- if not to beg for our daily bread?
- Beg for our daily bread.

466
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:23,008
It is, and has always been,
the food of the common man.

467
00:22:23,551 --> 00:22:27,179
But you, my dear guests,
are not the common man.

468
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,264
And so tonight...

469
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,808
...you get no bread.

470
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,777
- He must be joking.
- He's joking.

471
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,156
- This is next-level.
- How are you not gonna...

472
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,241
Wow, he's not kidding.

473
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,910
Not gonna serve bread at a restaurant
known for their bread. That's sweet.

474
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,036
- What?
- Thank you.

475
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,831
It's not a fake-out, is it?

476
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,666
- What?
- No.

477
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,793
It's gotta be a bit.

478
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,130
Are you fuckin' serious?

479
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:02,715
In this spirit,

480
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,635
please enjoy
the unaccompanied accompaniments.

481
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,096
"The bread
you will not be eating tonight

482
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,891
"was made from a heritage wheat
called red fife,

483
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:15,769
"crafted with our partners
at the Tehachapi Grain Project

484
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,646
"devoted to preserving heirloom grains."

485
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,607
- This is insane.
- Mmm!

486
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,527
I gotta say that the shit around
the total absence of the bread

487
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,571
is, like, really good.

488
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,198
I mean, it's a little outrageous,
isn't it?

489
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:31,076
It's fiendish, really.

490
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:35,247
I mean, he's always been keenly aware
of food as a history of class...

491
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,832
I mean, as have I.

492
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:37,917
Sure.

493
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:44,548
Though I will say that this emulsion
does look slightly split.

494
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,133
Yeah.

495
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:49,595
I mean, I wasn't gonna say anything.
I noticed as soon as it came down.

496
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,555
It's broken. It's broken.

497
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,516
Yeah, which is really...
I mean, you really...

498
00:23:56,602 --> 00:24:00,230
You really shouldn't see that in
a restaurant of this quality. There it is.

499
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,649
- Well, there it is.
- Yeah.

500
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:05,027
Oh, my God. I mean,
it's next-level badassery.

501
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,321
The way he weaves in
historical allegories.

502
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,407
I mean, the game is trying to guess
what the overarching theme

503
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,742
of the entire meal is gonna be.

504
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,077
You won't know until the end.

505
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,371
Wait. You... You like this?

506
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,580
Mmm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

507
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,248
He's basically insulting you.

508
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,668
No, no, no. You don't get it.

509
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:21,794
It's a concept.

510
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,671
I know what a concept is, Tyler.

511
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:25,130
Trust me. He's telling a story.

512
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:26,674
That's what makes his food so exciting.

513
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:29,301
He's not just a chef. He's a storyteller.

514
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:30,803
And he doesn't give a fuck
about the rules.

515
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,972
Call me the girl next door,
but maybe there are some rules

516
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,474
that you should give a fuck about,
like, I don't know,

517
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,309
giving food to people at a restaurant.

518
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:42,064
Dearest, no one would ever
call you the girl next door.

519
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,524
I make my own bread.

520
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,192
- You do? I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

521
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,194
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's very rustic.

522
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,405
It's peasant style. Yeasty.

523
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,240
What kind of yeast are you using?

524
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,909
Oh, I make my own from apples.

525
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,370
Well, of course you make
your own yeast from apples.

526
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,081
You wicked thing.

527
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,125
- Ms. Bloom?
- Mmm?

528
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,293
Here is another broken emulsion.

529
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,088
Courtesy of Chef Slowik.

530
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:12,803
- Hello.
- Excuse me.

531
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,471
Is everything to your liking, sir?

532
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:17,433
Well, actually, no. Thanks for asking.

533
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,518
Uh, I mean, look, the food's great

534
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,478
and we totally
get all the conceptual stuff.

535
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,439
But could we please get a little bread?

536
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,524
You know, and some gluten-free
for my friend as well?

537
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,692
No.

538
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,527
"No?"

539
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:30,237
No.

540
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,989
Okay.

541
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:35,075
This is all very clever,
and I didn't want to pull this card,

542
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,078
but you know who we are, right?

543
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:39,913
Yes.

544
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,166
You do? You know who we are?

545
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,500
I know who you are.

546
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:46,628
Mmm-hmm. Then you know
we work with Doug Verrick, right?

547
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,714
No, you work for Mr. Verrick.

548
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,466
- Exactly.
- Oh, fuck it.

549
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,302
And so you know,
we all play on the same team.

550
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,096
So, just slip us a little bread.

551
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,307
- Please.
- We won't tell a soul, lady.

552
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,309
- I promise, okay?
- No.

553
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,312
Did you say, "No?"

554
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,272
I said, "No." Yes.

555
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,440
- Okay.
- Okay.

556
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,775
- Wow.
- Okay.

557
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,860
That will be all, though. Thanks.

558
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,279
May I?

559
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,448
You don't have to do... Okay.

560
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,162
You will eat
less than you desire

561
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,830
and more than you deserve.

562
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,918
It's a pleasure to serve you.

563
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,421
Well, I remain in ketosis,
so that's good news.

564
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,633
Without the bread,
it really focuses you.

565
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,177
It's so fucking good. Embalm me in this.

566
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,098
- Are you not gonna try it?
- No.

567
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,432
- No?
- No.

568
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:41,517
This is great stuff.

569
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,685
- I'll take it and eat it.
- Yeah, go for it.

570
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:47,356
That was a total accident.

571
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,066
It happens to the best of us.

572
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:52,861
I'm...

573
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,863
I'm sorry. That was...

574
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,156
No, I'm so sorry.

575
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:00,911
You haven't touched your food.

576
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,205
There...

577
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,665
There is no food.

578
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,917
Well, no. This is food.

579
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,296
So, um, lots more food to come.

580
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,132
- Don't wanna fill up.
- That would not be possible.

581
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:15,968
I've precisely designed
the portions to account for that.

582
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,137
So, you won't fill up.

583
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:19,721
Please eat.

584
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,391
The menu only makes sense if you eat.

585
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,767
But you told us not to eat.

586
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,979
That is not what I meant, madam.
And you know it.

587
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,108
Well, thank you for your concern,

588
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,403
but I am perfectly capable
of deciding when I eat and what.

589
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,242
Thank you.

590
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,370
Christ, that was humiliating.

591
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,830
- "Humiliating?"
- Yeah.

592
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,540
Tyler, the guy is a prick.

593
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:47,666
Please don't.

594
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,419
You shouldn't be so fucking rude.

595
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,963
- What?
- He asked you to eat.

596
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,423
- I don't like it.
- Just try it.

597
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,507
Please.

598
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,685
Plating in three, my friends!

599
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,769
Yes, Chef!

600
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,918
That's a 2013
Pinot Noir from Ross Cobb.

601
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,378
We hyper-decanted it
with an immersion blender

602
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,255
to awaken it from its slumber.

603
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,509
Slavonian oak, rich cherry
and tobacco notes,

604
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:43,472
and a faint sense of longing and regret.

605
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,308
- Yes. Enjoy.
- Longing and regret.

606
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,018
My favorite.

607
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,274
She's staring again.

608
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,525
Where do we know her from?

609
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,735
We don't.

610
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:00,155
Well, she really does look like Claire.

611
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:02,074
Why do you keep saying that? She doesn't.

612
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,076
You don't think so?

613
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,619
She's nothing like our Claire.

614
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,206
That same faraway face.

615
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,958
Can we not obsess? Please?

616
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,920
I know. Hypothetically,
if you were leaving...

617
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,463
- Right.
- ...which you're not...

618
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,757
- Mmm-hmm.
- ...what would you be leaving for?

619
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,676
Associate Development Co-Exec.

620
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,261
And what the hell is that?

621
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:27,015
It's in development, so I'd be developing
or helping to develop things...

622
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,642
Why would that be better
than working for me?

623
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,102
Well, because there's a future there.

624
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,687
- It's a corporate...
- Right. Right.

625
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,022
A different kind of future.
Does that make sense?

626
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,107
At the corporate...

627
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,566
Thank God it's all
just hypothetical anyway.

628
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:40,112
The next course is called "Memory."

629
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,281
And that is what it's meant to evoke.

630
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,782
A memory.

631
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,993
So, let me tell you a memory of mine.

632
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:49,288
When I was growing up,
a child in Waterloo, Iowa,

633
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:52,082
Tuesday was taco night.

634
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,458
Oh, yeah!

635
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:54,584
Taco Tuesday!

636
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,336
Yeah!

637
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,755
And this, here, this lady here.

638
00:29:58,839 --> 00:29:59,965
This is my mother.

639
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,093
As you can see, she's rather drunk.

640
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,887
This is not unusual.

641
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,015
When I was seven years old,

642
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:11,518
one Tuesday, my father
came home quite drunk.

643
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,146
Really drunk.

644
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,023
Also, not unusual.

645
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,693
My mother grew angry and screamed at him,

646
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,863
at which point,
he proceeded to wrap a telephone cord

647
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,614
around her neck and pull it tight.

648
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:26,825
I wept.

649
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,453
I screamed, I begged him to stop.

650
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,038
To make him stop,

651
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:35,542
I finally had to stab him in the thigh
with kitchen scissors.

652
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,590
You remember that, Mother, don't you?

653
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:45,552
Now, I suppose I should've
stabbed him in the throat that evening.

654
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,764
But we're not so smart when we're young.

655
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,266
It was, as you can imagine,

656
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,311
as a very memorable taco night.

657
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,190
- Oh, thank God he didn't.
- I mean, what the fuck was that?

658
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,108
- Theatrical.
- You liked that?

659
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:03,445
Yeah, it's a backstory to what
makes him a chef artist.

660
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,531
Dude, that guy's got some
really dark sense of humor, bro.

661
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:07,783
He's such an intense dude.

662
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,412
So, here you have

663
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,208
house-smoked Bresse
chicken thigh al pastor

664
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,002
and our own tortillas
made with heirloom masa,

665
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,922
- one of Hawthorn's signature dishes.
- Thank you.

666
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:25,175
We change our menu constantly,
but, as Ms. Bloom knows,

667
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,677
this has been a staple since day one.

668
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,055
It's what you once said...

669
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,723
Put you on the map.

670
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,100
Put me on the map.

671
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,560
Precisely what map would that be...

672
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,187
I wonder.

673
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:41,316
Anyways, because we're always innovating,
and we fear irrelevance,

674
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,361
an update to a classic.

675
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:48,865
The images on the tortillas have been made
using a laser-engraving machine.

676
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,242
It's the first time we've used it.

677
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:55,205
We hope this taco night evokes
strong memories for us all.

678
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,289
Enjoy.

679
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,962
Well, of course he had to do a taco.

680
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:03,797
Here you are.

681
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:07,092
What are they, Lil?

682
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,552
They're restaurants.

683
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:10,929
Um...

684
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:16,726
That I reviewed that all closed.

685
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,811
Oh!

686
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,187
Like a gag, then?

687
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,022
Um, I think so.

688
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,941
Richard, what are these?

689
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,902
Taco things. For the tacos.

690
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:28,905
No, the pictures. They're all of us.

691
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:36,872
This one is after you had the melanoma
removed from your forehead.

692
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,081
There's the bandage.

693
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,541
Isn't that nice? They remembered us.

694
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:41,960
Tyler, is that you?

695
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,130
Yeah. They're all me from tonight
taking fucking photos.

696
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,049
Jesus Christ, what's with this guy?

697
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,177
I knew it. He hates me.

698
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,095
God damn it.
I didn't think he'd really mind.

699
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,681
- Should I apologize?
- Apologize for what?

700
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,725
- Oh...
- What?

701
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,311
<i>Calling Doctor Sunshine.</i>

702
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,022
Oh, my God. I forgot
about that one.

703
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,857
Dumb part. Bad script.

704
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,941
Fun shoot, though.

705
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,903
Hmm. Maybe it's a joke
'cause you're friends, right?

706
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,780
Yeah, yeah, you know, friends.

707
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,575
I mean, you know, do I have any friends?

708
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,786
Wait. Um...

709
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,747
Hey, guys, what the fuck?

710
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,249
Are these...

711
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,085
How did they get these?

712
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:28,507
It's not good.

713
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,801
Uh, excuse me.

714
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:37,349
Can I help you, sir?

715
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,683
Yeah. What...

716
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,769
What the hell are these?

717
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,354
These are tortillas.

718
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,441
Yes, and what are these?

719
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,069
These are tortillas

720
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,947
which contain EchoBrite's tax records
and other documents,

721
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,075
showing how your company
has created invoices with fake charges.

722
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,410
How did you get these?

723
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:00,288
I'm sorry, but Chef
never reveals his recipes.

724
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,457
Do you know how fucked you are?

725
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,210
We'll have this place closed
by the morning. Do you understand?

726
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:08,255
Oh, no, that won't be necessary.

727
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,465
Enjoy.

728
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,260
And this is you and...

729
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,013
Who is that woman?

730
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,309
Uh...

731
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,608
Well, how the hell
should I know? It's faked.

732
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:32,070
It's some sort of stupid joke.

733
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,489
It's a fucking taco, okay?
It can't hurt you.

734
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,449
Yeah, a fucking taco
that might hold up in court.

735
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:40,453
We have plausible deniability,
and if they try to turn us in...

736
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:41,538
Right!

737
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,790
If they turn us in,
they'd be turning Verrick in.

738
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,458
And then they'd be
just as fucked as we are.

739
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:46,668
Right? So, we're fine.

740
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:48,670
Right?

741
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,756
- Yeah, we're good.
- We're fine. Yeah, fuck it.

742
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,675
They can't take your photograph
without your consent. This is insane.

743
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,218
Stop talking and let me think, okay?

744
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,387
I have to make this right somehow.
I have to.

745
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,930
Well, I'll tell you how you make it right.

746
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,974
You send this shit back. Excuse me.

747
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:03,435
- Excuse me! Sir, hi.
- Hey. Margot! Margot!

748
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,313
Did you just fucking snap at me?

749
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,273
Do you know how long I've been
trying to get a reservation here?

750
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,649
No, and I don't really care.

751
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:12,193
You do not send shit back
to this kitchen, you child.

752
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:14,154
You thank them for
even letting you in the door.

753
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,156
- What did you just call me?
- I called you a child

754
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,282
because you're fucking acting like it.

755
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,576
Tyler, you need to apologize
to me right now.

756
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,660
You cannot speak to me that way.

757
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:23,121
Actually, I can because,
ding dong, I'm the one who's paying.

758
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,623
So maybe, shut up and eat.

759
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,294
Mmm. Oh, my God.

760
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,922
Oh, my God.

761
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,675
This is incredible. You have to try this.

762
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:38,136
No, thanks. Don't let me interrupt.

763
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,186
Miss Mills?

764
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:48,647
How can I assist you?

765
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,358
Just looking for the ladies' room.

766
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:52,442
Right this way.

767
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,403
Thank you.

768
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,114
What's behind that silver door?

769
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,408
Something very special.

770
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:30,408
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

771
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,153
No, you can't...

772
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:44,828
You shouldn't be in here.

773
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,539
I'd like to know specifically what it was

774
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,375
about the last course
that you did not enjoy.

775
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,252
You've barely eaten the food.

776
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,336
Why?

777
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,631
I need to know. Why don't you eat?

778
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,924
Why do you care?

779
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:01,219
I take my work very seriously,
and you're not eating.

780
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:03,722
And that wounds me.

781
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,989
I guess I'm just not very hungry.

782
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:23,742
I've told you who I am.

783
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,411
I'm Julian Slowik, and I am the chef here.

784
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,871
Now, who are you?

785
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:33,626
I'll ask again. Who are you?

786
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,878
I'm Margot Mills.

787
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,464
So, where are you from, Margot?

788
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,550
I'm from Grand Island, Nebraska.

789
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,677
Now, does that make you feel better?

790
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:44,763
You want the address for Mom's
trailer park, you asshole?

791
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,931
No, it's not who you want me
to think you are.

792
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,267
Who are you?

793
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,770
I am Margot.

794
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,064
You shouldn't be here tonight.

795
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,692
Please get the fuck out of my way.

796
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,223
Still very theatrical, but minimalist,

797
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,225
like the Japanese,
the "minimirasuto" style.

798
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,311
But he was being playful, right?

799
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,437
Yes.

800
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:35,730
I mean,
let's talk about the tacos.

801
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,524
It's a dialogue. It's playful.

802
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,743
I'm excited.

803
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,453
We're ready for our next course,

804
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,539
- which I think you'll find...
- Excuse me.

805
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:54,374
But what the hell is going on here?

806
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,960
Would you just let me finish, please?
That okay?

807
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,379
Thank you.

808
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:05,009
Ladies and gentlemen,
please meet sous-chef Jeremy Louden.

809
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,559
Jeremy created the next dish.

810
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:15,019
It's called "The Mess."

811
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:17,981
Originally from Sparks, Nevada,

812
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,526
Jeremy studied at the Culinary Institute
in Hyde Park.

813
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,572
Jeremy's goal, as he wrote
in a heartfelt letter,

814
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:28,032
was to work for me here at Hawthorn.

815
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,827
Isn't that right, Jeremy?

816
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,579
Yes, Chef.

817
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:35,957
Jeremy is talented.

818
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:38,835
He's good.

819
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,588
He's very good.

820
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,382
But he's not great.

821
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,094
He'll never be great.

822
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:54,183
He desperately wants
my prestige, my job, my talent.

823
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,563
He aspires to greatness,
but he'll never achieve it.

824
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:01,858
Correct, Jeremy?

825
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,359
Yes, Chef.

826
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,320
Like me at his age,

827
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,781
Jeremy has forsaken everything
to achieve his goals.

828
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:13,703
Like mine, his life is pressure.

829
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,123
Pressure to put out
the best food in the world.

830
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:21,920
And even when all goes right,
and the food is perfect,

831
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,423
and the customers are happy,
and the critics are, too,

832
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,301
there is no way to avoid the mess.

833
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,262
The mess you make of your life,

834
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,807
of your body, of your sanity,

835
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:41,689
by giving everything you have
to pleasing people you will never know.

836
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,359
Jeremy...

837
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,070
...do you like this life?

838
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,905
This life that you dreamed about?

839
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,158
- No, Chef.
- Mmm-hmm.

840
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,493
And do you want my life?

841
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,205
Not my position, nor my talent.

842
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,289
My life.

843
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,252
No, Chef.

844
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:20,645
Ladies and gentlemen, your fourth course,

845
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:24,357
sous-chef Jeremy's The Mess.

846
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:33,908
Fuck!

847
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,159
Oh, God!

848
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,078
What are you doing?

849
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:39,706
What's wrong with you?

850
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,541
The fuck is that?

851
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,711
That was a shock.
I didn't see that comin'.

852
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,379
What the fuck, man?

853
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,922
Please. Sit. Sit.

854
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,173
- Everything's fine.
- Please, it's all fine.

855
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,175
- What happened?
- It's just part of the menu.

856
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,844
- It's part of the show.
- It's a show?

857
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,470
That's a show? That's not...

858
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,180
This is what you're paying for.

859
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,390
That's a stunt?
What was that?

860
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,726
This is an exclusive experience.

861
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:00,935
- Please just...
- What the fuck, man?

862
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,145
...return to your seats.

863
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,272
Thank you so much.

864
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,108
Is he dead?

865
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,526
It's definitely
a squib or a packed...

866
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,610
- Stay right there.
- Can I invite you

867
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:10,903
- to sit down, please?
- I've seen them

868
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,280
- use it before.
- It's not funny.

869
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,240
What the fuck?

870
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,783
- Is this real?
- What is happening?

871
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:18,077
- It looks so damn real.
- No, no, no.

872
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,329
This is just theater, right?

873
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:21,748
What the fuck
are you talking about, lady?

874
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,291
He just fucking shot himself, okay?

875
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,668
It looked very real, Lillian.
Quite real.

876
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,004
This is... This is just theater.
It's stagecraft.

877
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,088
Is it really?

878
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,423
Yeah. This is what he does.

879
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,133
It's part of the menu.

880
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,237
Eat!

881
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,118
Enjoy.

882
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,336
Fifth course on order.

883
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,629
Yes, Chef!

884
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,424
Tyler, what the hell is going on?

885
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:16,094
And here we have
a bio dynamic Cabernet Franc

886
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:19,388
from our friends at Domaine Breton.

887
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:24,310
It has no added sulfites,
a bit of barnyard funk,

888
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:28,147
and just a wonderful match
with roasted proteins. Enjoy.

889
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:30,650
- We're leaving. Now.
- But I have to get my wrap.

890
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,235
- Forget your wrap. Get up.
- But I...

891
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,319
Mr. Leibrandt?

892
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,529
- We're leaving.
- Is something wrong?

893
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,655
We're leaving.

894
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:37,865
There is no boat to leave on.

895
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,117
Then I'll call a helicopter.

896
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,494
That would be very difficult
without phone service.

897
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,371
Fucking move.

898
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,164
Jesus. Just do what they say,
for God's sake!

899
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:46,874
I'll handle this.

900
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,627
- Just let me handle this.
- With which hand, Mr. Leibrandt?

901
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,753
What?

902
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:53,673
With which hand will you
handle this? Left or right?

903
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,424
What the fuck are you saying?

904
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:56,509
Shall we choose?

905
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:58,177
Choose what?

906
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,847
Very well. Left hand.

907
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,306
Ring finger.

908
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,560
Let me out! Let me out!

909
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,686
No!

910
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,020
Come on. Come on.

911
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,230
- Leave the guy alone.
- What the fuck are you doing?

912
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:12,191
Come on. Easy. Easy!
Leave him alone!

913
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:13,484
Leave the old guy alone!

914
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,862
Mr. Leibrandt, please hold still.

915
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,577
What the fuck are you doing?

916
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,039
Richard!

917
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:28,166
Richard!

918
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:31,252
Please stay seated.

919
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,506
Please stay seated.

920
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,011
What the...

921
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,555
What the hell's goin' on?
Get a doctor for him.

922
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,348
Do you need assistance finding your seat?

923
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,975
There's a finger. The finger.
There's a finger right there.

924
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,685
The man is screamin' in pain!

925
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,145
Please, sit.

926
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,229
Sir?

927
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,899
It's not funny, lady! Jesus Christ!

928
00:44:52,982 --> 00:44:55,193
It's all part of the menu.

929
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:57,486
Oh, my God!

930
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,655
This is real, isn't it? I can't do it.

931
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,533
- I can't do a hostage thing. I can't.
- Then why don't you go talk to him?

932
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:04,243
Go talk to him!
Because you know him, right?

933
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,411
I made that up.

934
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,621
Why?

935
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:10,374
Because I'm a name-dropping whore.
That's why, okay?

936
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,966
Your husband's ring, madam.

937
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,222
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

938
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,556
Ted. Ted!

939
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,936
I honestly think that this whole thing
is just for our benefit.

940
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:31,395
I mean, us.

941
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:35,191
That's why he texted me.
And this is incredible. Right?

942
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,360
The acting is astonishing.

943
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,861
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

944
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,531
Chef Slowik would like
to see you in the kitchen.

945
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:46,535
- Can I come, too?
- No.

946
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:07,223
No, no, I'm sorry, but you're all wrong.

947
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:08,349
Why are you doing this?

948
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,767
You're just simply wrong.

949
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,143
What are you talking about?

950
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:12,770
Who are you?

951
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:14,730
Margot.

952
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:17,024
My name is Margot.

953
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,860
I've served many Margots.
You're not a Margot.

954
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:22,571
- No.
- What the fuck does it matter?

955
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:25,408
It matters because this menu,
this guest list,

956
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:28,411
this entire evening
has been painstakingly planned.

957
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:31,038
And you were not a part of that plan.

958
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:33,833
And it's spoiling everything.

959
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,670
In order to proceed,
I have to know where to seat you.

960
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:40,298
With us, or with them?

961
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:42,591
It's really... It's very important.

962
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,219
And then you'll let me live?

963
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,595
Let you live? No!

964
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,347
Of course not.

965
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,892
Can't you see that
that would ruin the menu?

966
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:54,270
We're all gonna die tonight.

967
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,355
Isn't that right?

968
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:57,440
Yes, Chef!

969
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,109
So, the question is,

970
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,612
do you wanna die with those who give,
or with those who take?

971
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,865
But I die either way?

972
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:07,867
It's arbitrary.

973
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,661
No, it's not arbitrary.
Nothing in this kitchen is arbitrary.

974
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:13,289
Please pick.

975
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,375
These decisions are important, and, uh,

976
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:19,086
our menu is strictly timed.

977
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:21,547
In 15 minutes,

978
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:27,386
I'll take a break between courses,
and that is how long you have to decide.

979
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,181
It's our side or theirs.

980
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,392
In the meantime,
please return to your seat.

981
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:35,227
The next dish is exquisite.

982
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,444
- Plating in five!
- Yes, Chef!

983
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,113
- I love you all.
- We love you, too, Chef!

984
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,203
Fuck!
He offer you a kitchen course?

985
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,121
All right, what was it? Protein or veg?

986
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:59,043
Protein or veg? Hmm?

987
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,465
God damn it. It's not fucking fair.

988
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,258
Why do you get a kitchen course?

989
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,512
You smoke all day.
Can't even fucking taste it.

990
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,150
We're cornered. Let's focus.

991
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:26,445
Wait, what's the play here?
What are our options?

992
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:30,282
The door is guarded,
but it could be a play.

993
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,451
Yeah.

994
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:34,578
Has anybody seen
down the hallway if we can...

995
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,957
Hey, guys. We gotta do something,
and we can't be cowards.

996
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,834
This worked in a movie
I did called <i>The Assault.</i>

997
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,420
When they bring their knives and forks,
we just storm their kitchen, okay?

998
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:44,088
You think we have
better knife skills than them?

999
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,423
What other choice do we have?

1000
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:46,715
I don't fuckin' know, man.

1001
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:47,967
So what, then? We...

1002
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,261
Fuck it. I'm gonna break
this fucking window.

1003
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,388
Yeah! Go for it! Go for it!

1004
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:03,065
Fuck!

1005
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,652
Please let me help you back to your table.

1006
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:07,736
Fuck.

1007
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:11,157
I'm sorry, man.

1008
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,911
- God.
- Fuck.

1009
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:17,496
There's a saying.

1010
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,082
"Sometimes all you need
is a good cup of tea."

1011
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:24,587
I learned that growing up in Bratislava.

1012
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,089
I've found that not only
does tea cleanse the palate,

1013
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:31,635
but it offers a soothing balm
when facing some hard home truths.

1014
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,472
But before we continue,

1015
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,267
are there any questions
about me or Hawthorn?

1016
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,561
Any questions?

1017
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,149
Is this bergamot I'm getting, Chef?

1018
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,318
Yes, it is.

1019
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,320
- Chef?
- Yes?

1020
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,907
Uh, I think I speak for everybody here
when I say that, uh...

1021
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:55,743
I wanna know... I mean, we wanna know...

1022
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,536
Why the fuck is this happening, man?

1023
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,414
Well, I'll tell you.
Think of yourselves as ingredients

1024
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,625
in a degustation concept.

1025
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,127
- What?
- A tasting concept.

1026
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:07,713
Figuratively speaking.

1027
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,507
I think that is the best way
to describe it.

1028
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:13,385
But none of this should be
a surprise to most of you.

1029
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:15,221
Ms. Bloom.

1030
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:19,850
Lillian, if I may,
my cherished early advocate

1031
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:23,479
knows the damage she has done
to so many livelihoods.

1032
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,981
No, no, no. Hang on, Chef.

1033
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:27,733
No, no, no. No, you don't talk.

1034
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,984
I'm sorry, Chef.

1035
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,945
You submitted to an interview

1036
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,863
- with Lillian Bloom.
- What? What?

1037
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,365
And that interview
created this restaurant.

1038
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,992
You enable her filth.
You enable her filth.

1039
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,911
You buttress.

1040
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,454
You coddle.

1041
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,165
More broken emulsion, madam.

1042
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:46,502
You loved that I texted you
an invitation for this evening.

1043
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,421
Me yearning for your attendance.

1044
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:52,132
Your ego was fed.
But that is to be expected.

1045
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,134
And no, you've fed my ego as well.

1046
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,929
Ten minutes, Ms. Mills.

1047
00:50:57,012 --> 00:51:00,391
Please. My... My husband
needs to go to the hospital.

1048
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,434
I'm fine. Just let my wife go.

1049
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:04,478
My loyal regulars.

1050
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:07,940
How many times have you eaten here
in the last five years?

1051
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,608
I don't know. Six or seven?

1052
00:51:09,692 --> 00:51:13,946
- I think it's more than that, Dick.
- Eleven. Eleven times.

1053
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:17,825
Most people consider themselves blessed
if they eat here only once.

1054
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,870
Mr. Leibrandt,
kindly name one dish you ate

1055
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:23,872
the last time you were here.

1056
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,171
Eleven times you take the boat out here

1057
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:34,883
where we introduce every dish
every single time.

1058
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:37,219
We tell you exactly
what we're feeding you.

1059
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:40,556
Please tell me one dish you ate
the last time you were here.

1060
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,600
Or the time before.

1061
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,060
One. Please.

1062
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,732
- Cod.
- What?

1063
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,484
Cod.

1064
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:54,320
Cod.

1065
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:57,156
It wasn't cod, you donkey.

1066
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,782
It was halibut.

1067
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:01,327
Rare, fucking spotted halibut.

1068
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,412
What does it matter?

1069
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,706
It matters to the halibut, Mrs. Leibrandt.

1070
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:09,501
And to the artist whose work
turns to shit inside your gut.

1071
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,130
I've allowed my work
to reach the price point

1072
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:17,051
where only the class of people
in this room can access it.

1073
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,219
And I've been fooled
into trying to satisfy

1074
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:21,972
people who could never be satisfied.

1075
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:24,642
Starting with her.

1076
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:26,685
But that's our culture, isn't it?

1077
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:29,104
And my restaurant is part of the problem.

1078
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,190
You say it's your restaurant.

1079
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:34,318
But if we're all just bein'
honest tonight, it's not.

1080
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,280
You're right.
Doug Verrick is my angel investor.

1081
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:40,699
He owns this island and this restaurant.

1082
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:44,203
And since Hawthorn is my entire life,

1083
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:46,872
I would have to say
that Doug Verrick owns me.

1084
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,208
Except now things are
a little more complicated,

1085
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,710
and I own Doug Verrick.

1086
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,011
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

1087
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,055
Holy shit.

1088
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,598
Hey, hey. How do we stop this, man?

1089
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,392
- No.
- Okay? Just please just make it stop.

1090
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:08,769
Just fuckin' tell us how to stop this.
We'll stop it, okay?

1091
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,938
- You can't stop it.
- Obviously, we have money.

1092
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,981
Just say how much,
and we'll give it to you!

1093
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:15,401
Just say a fucking number, man!

1094
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:18,487
No. I don't need your money.

1095
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:28,914
He kept you open through COVID, you prick!

1096
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:32,501
Yes, he did.
And he questioned my menu.

1097
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:37,840
He would even request substitutions
despite the fact that

1098
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:42,386
there are no substitutions at Hawthorn!

1099
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,390
Fallen angel, please.

1100
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:53,230
No! No, no!

1101
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,733
What the hell?

1102
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:57,025
- No.
- Listen.

1103
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:59,027
- This is fucking...
- I said, "Listen."

1104
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:01,739
No! Julian!

1105
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,657
- This is fuckin' insane.
- I said, "Listen."

1106
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:04,742
No...

1107
00:54:06,869 --> 00:54:08,829
- Listen.
- No, no. This is fuckin' insane.

1108
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,122
No, I said, "Listen!"

1109
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,791
Just listen!

1110
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:13,917
Yeah.

1111
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,422
Do you hear?

1112
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:20,966
And...

1113
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,969
And...

1114
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,098
...under he goes, and...

1115
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:31,185
...quiet.

1116
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,436
Do you hear it?

1117
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:35,481
Do you hear that silence?
Listen, can you hear it?

1118
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,151
That silence means...

1119
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:41,737
I'm free.

1120
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,580
Time's up, Ms. Mills.

1121
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:54,208
Chef will speak with you now
in his office.

1122
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:04,718
Come in.

1123
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,147
You've made your decision?

1124
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:19,399
- I have.
- And what have you decided?

1125
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:22,694
That you were right.

1126
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,031
I shouldn't be here.

1127
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,450
And I say this with respect,

1128
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:31,078
because I'm sure
that you're quite brilliant,

1129
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:35,541
but, um, all of this is not meant for me.

1130
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:38,836
You're not sure I'm brilliant,
so don't say it. It's false.

1131
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:40,504
Fine.

1132
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,506
I'm not sure that you're brilliant.

1133
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,216
Oh, I was expecting more.

1134
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,801
Fuck you!

1135
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:48,595
I guess I'm gonna have to make
your decision for you.

1136
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:53,475
You belong here with your own breed.

1137
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:56,687
And what breed is that?

1138
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,397
With the shit shovelers.

1139
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:00,649
You thought I couldn't tell?

1140
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:04,820
Oh, I know a fellow
service industry worker when I see one.

1141
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:08,574
Mr. Leibrandt. How do you know him?

1142
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:11,869
You've been eyeing him all evening.

1143
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:14,955
- Well, I think you know.
- No, I don't.

1144
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:19,334
So, he paid for an experience.

1145
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:23,213
And I can tell,
as one provider of experiences to another,

1146
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,299
that you don't rattle easily.

1147
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:28,343
So, how did he rattle you?

1148
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:29,845
- He didn't rattle...
- Margot.

1149
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:34,057
He told me to agree
with everything he said

1150
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:35,767
and continue eye contact
while he jerked <i>off.</i>

1151
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,436
Wow. Specific.

1152
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,687
Not really.

1153
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:41,148
Pretty unoriginal.

1154
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:44,776
What rattled me

1155
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:48,155
is that he told me
to tell him that he was a good man,

1156
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,448
and that I was his daughter,

1157
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,783
and that he loved me,
and I loved him and...

1158
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:53,327
And so, he's a romantic.

1159
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,747
No, I don't need details.

1160
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:00,083
You know, I...
I know what a bad customer is.

1161
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:04,630
Yeah.

1162
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,426
Do you enjoy providing your services?

1163
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,305
Yes.

1164
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,308
Or I... I used to.

1165
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,520
Do you enjoy providing yours?

1166
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:22,814
Oh, I used to,

1167
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:27,569
but I haven't desired to cook
for someone in ages.

1168
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,156
And one does miss that feeling.

1169
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:34,493
Come with me.

1170
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:40,082
Everyone's so down!

1171
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:43,418
Ladies and gentlemen, for our next course,

1172
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:46,213
let us take the evening air!

1173
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:47,756
Come on! Outside!

1174
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,050
- Please, sir.
- Come on. Outside, everyone.

1175
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,802
If we can find a boat,
we can make a break for it.

1176
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,262
- Regulars, too. Come on.
- Please follow Chef.

1177
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:57,933
Chef, I'd love to talk to you
very quickly, Chef.

1178
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,559
- Come on!
- After you, please.

1179
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:00,978
Guests first.

1180
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:03,689
Richard.

1181
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,486
Follow me.

1182
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,489
Into the tranquil night air.

1183
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:23,542
Don't be frightened.
Nothing to be frightened of.

1184
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,046
So, maybe there's a spare boat somewhere
and we can get out of here.

1185
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,381
To what?

1186
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,008
- What?
- Get out of here to what?

1187
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:32,509
What the fuck are you talking about, bro?

1188
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,719
- We're dead.
- It's okay.

1189
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:34,845
No. We're gonna die tonight.

1190
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,096
- Yes, we are. Yeah.
- Yeah.

1191
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:40,475
Our next course will be presented
by sous-chef, Katherine Keller.

1192
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:47,232
Good evening, everyone.

1193
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,694
Three years ago,

1194
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,113
Julian Slowik tried to fuck me.

1195
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:56,158
I refused his advances.

1196
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,493
A week later, he tried again.

1197
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:00,746
And again, I refused.

1198
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,623
But he didn't fire me.

1199
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,208
No.

1200
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,335
He kept me in his kitchen,

1201
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:13,091
and refused to look me in the eye
or speak directly to me for eight months.

1202
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:15,802
He can do that.

1203
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:18,221
Because he's the star.

1204
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,099
He's the man.

1205
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:25,687
Our next course is called "Man's Folly."

1206
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:53,548
I'm sorry.

1207
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,473
Fuck.

1208
01:00:02,182 --> 01:00:06,186
To our male diners,
we now offer you the chance to escape.

1209
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,481
You'll be given a 45-second head start,

1210
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:13,151
at which point members of my staff
will try and catch you.

1211
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:14,653
If they do catch...

1212
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,154
Okay.

1213
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:19,866
Forty-five seconds starts now.

1214
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,537
- Hold this.
- What?

1215
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,622
I'm sorry. Come on. You know I'm awful.

1216
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,332
You're a wonderful critic.

1217
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,502
I'll... I'll send for help. First thing.

1218
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,721
You, too.

1219
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:50,730
I'll, uh, leave you to it.

1220
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:57,195
Care to join me inside?

1221
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:58,947
It's getting chilly.

1222
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:02,159
It's right this way.

1223
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:05,996
Okay.

1224
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:07,622
This way.

1225
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:24,306
Go!

1226
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:35,609
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1227
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,830
Mmm.

1228
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:50,874
This is fantastic.

1229
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:55,462
The tartness of the umeboshi
and the waves of ferment.

1230
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,672
It's rich, and yet it's clean.

1231
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:59,049
It's delicious.

1232
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,302
Yes, well, there was a time

1233
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,346
that would have meant
a lot to me, Ms. Bloom.

1234
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:15,982
Mmm.

1235
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,108
It's so good.

1236
01:02:17,192 --> 01:02:18,860
- Yes, it's really good.
- Mmm-hmm.

1237
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:21,488
You know, it's the emoji for me.

1238
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,114
- Umeboshi.
- Hmm?

1239
01:02:23,198 --> 01:02:24,532
- Umeboshi.
- Umeboshi.

1240
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:25,867
This is so good.

1241
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:28,245
- You're very talented.
- Thank you.

1242
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:31,122
Usually don't like foam, but...

1243
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:34,209
Don't fucking run next to me, bro!

1244
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:35,460
No, you're running next to me!

1245
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,170
It's a big fuckin' forest!
Fuck off!

1246
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:38,713
- Get away from me!
- Fuck off, bro!

1247
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:43,134
Fuck.

1248
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,803
Oh, my God.

1249
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:47,222
Yeah.

1250
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:51,893
So...

1251
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:55,689
You know my husband.

1252
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:03,530
Um...

1253
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:06,700
Yeah.

1254
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,368
I do.

1255
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:10,912
Right.

1256
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:18,628
You can tell us.

1257
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:20,964
Are we all really dying tonight?

1258
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:25,343
It doesn't work if you live.

1259
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,054
- What doesn't work?
- The menu.

1260
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,139
Why not?

1261
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:31,141
It needs an ending...

1262
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,061
That ties everything together
conceptually.

1263
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,981
Otherwise, it just tastes good,
and who cares.

1264
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,233
I mean, really,
you should have your own place.

1265
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,985
Right? And I could help you with that.

1266
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,863
- I'm sure you could, Ms. Bloom.
- I could. I could.

1267
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:47,532
We would just have
to talk about...

1268
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,577
...the dying thing.

1269
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,830
Oh, everyone dying was my pitch, actually.

1270
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:56,249
I'm super proud of it.

1271
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:01,963
- Anybody want any wine?
- Yes, please.

1272
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,131
Fuck it.

1273
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:05,842
Thank you.

1274
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:11,598
I heard a pop.

1275
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:16,436
Fuck!

1276
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:18,438
Fuck!

1277
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,830
A special bite
for the last guest to be caught.

1278
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:39,209
A little play on the Passard egg
with créme fraîche and maple.

1279
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,757
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

1280
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:51,513
Not that you guys
give a single, flying fuck,

1281
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,765
but my name is not Margot.

1282
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:55,642
It's Erin.

1283
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,353
And I'm from Brockton, Massachusetts...

1284
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:01,898
So there's that.

1285
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,113
Party's over.

1286
01:05:12,075 --> 01:05:13,076
Come, gentlemen.

1287
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:15,412
- Welcome back.
- What did you get?

1288
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:16,496
Sir? Please.

1289
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,706
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I'll take that. Thank you.

1290
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,250
Ms. Bloom. Please.

1291
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,336
Allow me. No, it's fine. It's fine.

1292
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:28,258
Here.

1293
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:30,260
Oh, God.

1294
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:36,391
How'd you do out there?

1295
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,602
I did great. I killed it.

1296
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:41,604
I'm the only one who got away.

1297
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:44,858
I'm sorry. I'm a fuckin' failure.

1298
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:46,234
It's okay.

1299
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,488
I've been stealing money from you.

1300
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:52,740
I know.

1301
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:54,951
I know you know.

1302
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:58,079
I wrote a negative recommendation to Sony.

1303
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:00,999
I know. You cc'd me on it.

1304
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:03,710
Folks,

1305
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:07,881
I'm afraid our menu
cannot continue as planned

1306
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,508
until we deal with an unresolved matter.

1307
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:12,719
You.

1308
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:15,763
Me?

1309
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:17,891
Mmm-hmm.

1310
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,017
You.

1311
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,354
Tell me why you're here.

1312
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:27,734
You know, because I wanted to...

1313
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:28,818
Swallow first.

1314
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,656
I wanted to experience your food, Chef.

1315
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:34,949
And what were you told?

1316
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,786
What were you told ahead of time?

1317
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,876
You told me it'd be
the greatest menu ever created.

1318
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:46,711
Right. And? And?

1319
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:53,927
And that everyone would die.

1320
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,261
"Everyone would die."

1321
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:57,597
You had a date.

1322
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,308
I seem to remember you had a date.

1323
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:02,644
Not the young woman here tonight,

1324
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:05,647
so what happened to her? Your date?

1325
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:09,317
She broke up with me, Chef.

1326
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,985
So, you brought Margot.

1327
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:12,529
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

1328
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:13,655
Why?

1329
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,742
'Cause you don't offer seatings for one.

1330
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:20,620
So, you hired her knowing she'd die.

1331
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:26,417
- Yes.
- You entitled piece of shit!

1332
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:29,128
I'm gonna kill you, Tyler!

1333
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:32,590
Calm down.

1334
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,305
You can't blame her, can you?

1335
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:41,975
For the eight months
I've corresponded with you,

1336
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:46,312
I gave you, Tyler,
access to our world, hmm.

1337
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:48,773
And I swore you to secrecy.

1338
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,109
Why do you think I'd do this?

1339
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:53,778
- You wanted me here because...
- Why? Why?

1340
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,822
...you said I know a lot about food.

1341
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,074
That's right.
You're not like the others, are you?

1342
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:00,159
I mean, you know what a Pacojet is.

1343
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:02,453
- Yeah.
- You knew what the bergamot was.

1344
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:04,706
- Yeah. I could taste it.
- Yeah, you could.

1345
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,374
Yeah, I know, but you identified it.

1346
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:08,293
- Picked it out.
- Mmm-hmm. Right.

1347
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:09,711
That impressed me.

1348
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:11,212
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

1349
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:12,714
- I mean, you're a cook.
- Oh!

1350
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,465
Cooks belong in the kitchen.

1351
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:16,467
Right?

1352
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:18,177
Yes, Chef!

1353
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:19,262
Yeah.

1354
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:21,347
- Come with me.
- Really?

1355
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:22,849
Me? Really?

1356
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,225
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I have something for you.

1357
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:26,853
Okay.

1358
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,605
Come here. Elsa has it.

1359
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:30,857
Ah, it's a chefs jacket.

1360
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:35,737
Courtesy of Hawthorn.

1361
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,071
- Wow.
- Mmm-hmm.

1362
01:08:39,407 --> 01:08:40,491
Ah!

1363
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,285
- Nice.
- Thank you.

1364
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:44,954
You look wonderful.
Doesn't he look wonderful, Margot?

1365
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:47,290
- Doesn't he look good?
- Yes, Chef!

1366
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:49,292
Mr. Handsome Boy.

1367
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,714
I'm gonna personalize the jacket.

1368
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,800
"T, Y,

1369
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:00,303
"L, E,

1370
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:02,597
"R."

1371
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:07,060
Thank you. Thank you.

1372
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:09,395
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you, Chef.

1373
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,023
Tyler, now cook.

1374
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,234
- What?
- Cook.

1375
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:18,655
- You're a cook. So, cook.
- Oh, I don't know if I can cook here.

1376
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:21,032
- Cook. Cook.
- Now? I don't...

1377
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:22,992
Cook! Go on, now.

1378
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:24,452
What do you need?

1379
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:26,162
- We have everything.
- Please rise to observe

1380
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:27,330
- the demonstration.
- Don't be frightened.

1381
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:30,208
- What do you want... Um...
- Please rise to observe the demonstration.

1382
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,417
Everyone, please come around.

1383
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:35,046
Please. Tyler's gonna demonstrate
his culinary expertise.

1384
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:36,714
Please rise to observe the demonstration.

1385
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:38,383
Everyone, please.
Come around. Come closer.

1386
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:39,592
What do you need?

1387
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:43,262
- Uh... Leeks.
- Get the cook some leeks.

1388
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:46,182
Leeks. This is your station here.
What else?

1389
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:49,227
Um... Sh... Ah...

1390
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,646
Oh... Shit? Would you like some shit?

1391
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:52,730
No. Uh...

1392
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:54,357
Shallots.

1393
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,192
Shallots for the great foodie!

1394
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:57,527
The phenomenal Mr. Food himself!

1395
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:58,653
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

1396
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:01,239
Everyone gather around.
We must learn from Tyler.

1397
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:07,453
This is a new dicing method
of which we have been woefully ignorant.

1398
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:08,579
What next?

1399
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:10,415
Uh... Butter.

1400
01:10:10,498 --> 01:10:13,167
Butter? Butter.
Leeks and shallots sautéed in butter.

1401
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:16,045
I bear witness to a revolution in cuisine.

1402
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:18,005
Would you like a protein?

1403
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:20,258
- Uh... Lamb.
- Lamb!

1404
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:30,685
Oh!

1405
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:40,820
Oh!

1406
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:52,415
Oh, yeah. I think it's done, Chef.

1407
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:53,541
You think it's done? You're sure?

1408
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:54,667
- Mmm-hmm.
- You wanna...

1409
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:56,085
Maybe you wanna jam it into the Pacojet.

1410
01:10:56,836 --> 01:10:57,920
No.

1411
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:06,387
Mmm.

1412
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:09,015
Wow.

1413
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:11,517
Wow.

1414
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,394
It's actually quite...

1415
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:15,396
...bad.

1416
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:34,999
You are why the mystery
has been drained from our art.

1417
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:38,586
You see that now, don't you?

1418
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,297
Sorry, Chef.

1419
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,383
Come here, son. Come.

1420
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,345
Come here.

1421
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:11,285
Yes, Chef.

1422
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:27,301
And now you're free, too.

1423
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:34,642
Um, ladies and gentlemen,
I wanna apologize to you all.

1424
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:38,229
What you just saw was not originally
part of tonight's menu.

1425
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:40,189
We strive for perfection,

1426
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,483
which of course does not exist,

1427
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:46,696
and that is a hard truth for me to accept,
so please forgive me.

1428
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:49,073
Come with me.

1429
01:12:55,663 --> 01:12:57,331
And that concludes our demonstration.

1430
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:58,749
Please return to your seats.

1431
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,293
Listen to me.

1432
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:04,380
There's only one more
savory course left in our menu.

1433
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,173
That means we must prepare for dessert.

1434
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:08,885
Dessert requires a large barrel

1435
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:10,595
that is supposed to be
there in the corner.

1436
01:13:11,262 --> 01:13:12,889
Do you see a barrel?

1437
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:16,267
- No. No, I do not.
- Neither do I.

1438
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,811
That is because
my negligent colleague, Elsa,

1439
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:20,730
forgot to assign someone to bring it.

1440
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:25,776
So, Margot,
you will fetch the barrel instead.

1441
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:26,986
- Me?
- Yes.

1442
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:28,988
You remember the smokehouse? Hmm?

1443
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,615
Maybe... I don't...

1444
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:32,241
Chef, perhaps one of us should...

1445
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:35,036
Margot is now one of us, Elsa.

1446
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:36,203
Right, Margot?

1447
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:38,456
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

1448
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:41,375
Yes, Chef.

1449
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:43,586
Elsa, give her the smokehouse key.

1450
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:47,673
Yes, Chef.

1451
01:13:53,012 --> 01:13:54,013
Go.

1452
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:55,598
Go!

1453
01:13:55,681 --> 01:13:56,766
Um...

1454
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:37,306
Excuse me. Uh...

1455
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,476
I'm sorry, Chef.

1456
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:43,354
Sir... Sir Slowik. Um...

1457
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:45,982
Hi.

1458
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:47,066
What's up?

1459
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:50,111
Oh... Well, look...

1460
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:54,198
What I really...
I just wanted to say because, um...

1461
01:14:54,699 --> 01:14:57,076
Look, I'm not trying to sound,
like, all whatever here or anything,

1462
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:00,538
but I just don't think it's really fair.

1463
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:01,747
Maybe.

1464
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:02,999
If...

1465
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:05,501
Do you wanna know
why you're being punished?

1466
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:10,506
Sure.

1467
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:15,219
I saw the film <i>Calling Doctor Sunshine,</i>
and I did not enjoy it.

1468
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:16,887
Wait, sorry?

1469
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:18,222
It was a Sunday.

1470
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:20,641
My one day off in months.

1471
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:22,601
The most precious day.

1472
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:24,437
The day where I was allowed to live.

1473
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:28,524
And I saw the film <i>Calling Doctor Sunshine</i>
alone in the cinema.

1474
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:31,777
But look, I didn't direct it.
I just acted in it.

1475
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:34,405
The memory of your face in that film,

1476
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:38,826
and seeing you again now haunts me.

1477
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:39,952
Drives me.

1478
01:15:40,494 --> 01:15:44,331
What happens to an artist
when he loses his purpose?

1479
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,292
It's pitiful.

1480
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:48,502
No, you're right.

1481
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:53,799
And what about her?

1482
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:56,052
What school did you go to?

1483
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:57,928
Brown.

1484
01:15:58,012 --> 01:15:59,180
Student loans?

1485
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:01,182
No.

1486
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:02,808
I'm sorry. You're dying.

1487
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,290
Motherfucker.

1488
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:11,252
Really?

1489
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,856
No one is allowed
inside Chefs house.

1490
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:33,607
Do you think you're special?

1491
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:38,696
You've disobeyed this rule.

1492
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:48,038
I take care of the customers
so that Chef can take care of the menu.

1493
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:55,379
You've been a nuisance
since you have arrived.

1494
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:56,672
I'm sorry.

1495
01:17:58,174 --> 01:17:59,884
If you don't mind me asking though,

1496
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:02,469
why would you die for him?

1497
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:04,847
You will not replace me.

1498
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:08,851
Replace you?
Trust me, I have no...

1499
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:18,777
No, no. No!

1500
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:44,637
Stop! Enough!

1501
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:48,182
He didn't tell me about the barrel.

1502
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:50,100
I didn't forget.

1503
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:53,812
Oh, my God!

1504
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:44,048
Oh, my God.

1505
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:45,549
Um...

1506
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:52,931
Hello?

1507
01:20:53,432 --> 01:20:59,271
<i>Happy birthday, dear Bryce</i>

1508
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:04,985
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1509
01:21:05,069 --> 01:21:06,695
You told them it was my birthday?

1510
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:09,114
Seemed funny about three hours ago.

1511
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:10,366
Thank you.

1512
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:21,293
Well, leave it there and take your seat.

1513
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:29,802
I want you to
understand something, Margot.

1514
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:37,851
I am a monster.

1515
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:40,687
No, was a monster.

1516
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:42,523
And a whore.

1517
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:46,318
But tonight, everything I'm doing is pure.

1518
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:47,486
Egoless.

1519
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:51,156
And at last, the pain is almost gone.

1520
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,492
Chefs hands.

1521
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:56,870
Asbestos hands.

1522
01:21:56,954 --> 01:22:02,167
I can carry a cast-iron from a hot oven
to your table with no protection.

1523
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:06,463
I can no longer be hurt, Margot.

1524
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:11,176
As Dr. King said,
"We know through painful experience

1525
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:14,847
"that freedom is never
voluntarily given by the oppressor.

1526
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,267
"It must be demanded by the oppressed."

1527
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:20,018
Did he just quote Martin Luther King?

1528
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:21,186
- Yep.
- Yes, he did.

1529
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:26,150
What?

1530
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,613
I see you found our radio.

1531
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:33,824
Clear the dining room immediately!

1532
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:35,075
It's a boat!

1533
01:22:36,743 --> 01:22:38,036
Did you call someone?

1534
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:41,248
- It's a boat.
- It's a boat.

1535
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:46,628
What? What are you doing?

1536
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:49,590
Easy! Easy, there!

1537
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:51,049
The fuck are you doing to that man?

1538
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:52,509
Bro, easy with that!

1539
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:56,138
Tight, tight, tight.

1540
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:57,347
Good.

1541
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:03,020
You'll be tempted to ask him for help.

1542
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:04,855
- To plead, even.
- No, no, no.

1543
01:23:04,938 --> 01:23:07,232
This would be unwise. He cannot help you.

1544
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:08,525
Ask yourselves two things.

1545
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:12,696
One, if you really wanna be responsible
for the death of an innocent man.

1546
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:16,074
And two, ask yourselves,
this entire evening,

1547
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:18,952
why didn't you all try harder
to fight back?

1548
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:20,662
To get out of here?

1549
01:23:21,413 --> 01:23:23,248
Honestly, you probably could have.

1550
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,084
Something to think about.

1551
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:37,513
Good evening, Officer.
How can we help you?

1552
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:39,640
I got a report of a disturbance.

1553
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:42,434
Uh, here?

1554
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:43,810
What kind of a disturbance?

1555
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:46,605
A violent one.

1556
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:49,983
- Are you the owner?
- I am the executive chef.

1557
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:53,320
Ownership changed hands recently,
but that's another story.

1558
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:55,447
Now, I don't wish to be rude,
but as you can see,

1559
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:57,199
we're right in the middle of service.

1560
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:04,748
Did anybody here call in a distress
over the shortwave tonight?

1561
01:24:09,086 --> 01:24:11,547
We're not in the habit
of serving our guests

1562
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:14,174
shortwave radios with their meals.

1563
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:26,812
Hey.

1564
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:28,564
Uh... Are you...

1565
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:31,733
Yes, yes, yes. I am.

1566
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,361
Wow. I'm a big fan.

1567
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:35,988
Thank you.

1568
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:37,406
Would you like his autograph?

1569
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:41,201
Uh...

1570
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:42,953
I don't want to bother you.

1571
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:45,706
No, no, no. It wouldn't be a bother.

1572
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:47,749
I just, I don't have a...

1573
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:50,168
No, we have a pen. Let's do it.

1574
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:52,462
Yeah.

1575
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:53,839
Thank you.

1576
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:56,842
- What's your name?
- Dale.

1577
01:24:56,925 --> 01:24:59,803
- Dale. What's up, Dale?
- Hi.

1578
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,556
You're great.

1579
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,891
My wife and I, we loved that, um...

1580
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:07,519
What's it called?
The one where you play the surgeon?

1581
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:10,230
Yeah. <i>Calling Doctor Sunshine.</i>

1582
01:25:10,314 --> 01:25:12,941
- Yeah! Yeah, great stuff.
- Here you go.

1583
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:14,735
Thank you so much.

1584
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:18,405
Okay. Um...

1585
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:23,577
Well, sorry again for bothering you folks.
Uh, I'll be leaving now.

1586
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,037
For all you do, man, anytime.

1587
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,997
Well, thank you for your service.

1588
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:39,134
Hands on your head! Everyone! Now!

1589
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:41,553
No, no. You're joking.

1590
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:42,721
You're joking.

1591
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,264
I am not joking, sir.

1592
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:46,975
Come on. Clearly,
there's a misunderstanding.

1593
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:48,101
Help us!

1594
01:25:48,185 --> 01:25:50,103
- Yes! Yes!
- He wants to kill us all!

1595
01:25:50,187 --> 01:25:52,356
Back to your seats!
Everyone! Back to your seat now!

1596
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:54,066
He's fucking crazy!

1597
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:55,400
Back in your chair now.

1598
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:57,944
Silence! Everyone, back to where you were.

1599
01:25:58,028 --> 01:25:59,988
Sit down. Now!

1600
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:01,698
Quiet!

1601
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:03,367
- It's him! It's him!
- Him!

1602
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:05,786
- Everyone!
- He wants to kill us all!

1603
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:07,245
Do not speak!

1604
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:10,916
You.

1605
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:14,044
On your knees with your hands
over your head. Now.

1606
01:26:14,127 --> 01:26:16,380
- Yes!
- Thank you!

1607
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:20,801
- You are fucked!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

1608
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:21,885
Oh, my God!

1609
01:26:21,968 --> 01:26:24,471
All these other fuckers
are with them too, sir. Watch out.

1610
01:26:24,554 --> 01:26:26,264
- Calm down!
- Fuck you!

1611
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:27,683
- Stay calm.
- Fuck you!

1612
01:26:28,392 --> 01:26:32,562
Nobody move until I say so. No one move!

1613
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:38,694
- No, no!
- What are you doing?

1614
01:26:38,777 --> 01:26:39,820
Hey, hey, hey.

1615
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:40,904
- Him, him, him!
- No!

1616
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:53,375
Thank you, Dale. Thank you.

1617
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:01,383
Good job.

1618
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:07,305
So, in a kitchen we all work together,
or nothing works at all.

1619
01:27:08,515 --> 01:27:10,183
We work as a team.

1620
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:15,564
You...

1621
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:18,316
Margot from Nebraska.

1622
01:27:21,278 --> 01:27:24,865
You... You've betrayed
our sacred bond of trust.

1623
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:29,661
And you've shown your craft
to be careless.

1624
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:34,791
I was wrong.
You're an eater. You're a taker.

1625
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:37,461
Like all the rest.

1626
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:51,975
Final course! Plating in five!

1627
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,518
Yes, Chef!

1628
01:28:31,389 --> 01:28:33,266
I don't like your food.

1629
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:34,434
What did you say?

1630
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:38,355
I said I don't like your food,
and I would like to send it back.

1631
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:57,249
I'm sorry to hear that.

1632
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:00,460
What about my food is not to your liking?

1633
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:04,297
For starters,

1634
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:07,300
you've taken the joy out of eating.

1635
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:11,847
Every dish you served tonight
has been some intellectual exercise

1636
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:14,766
rather than something you want
to sit and enjoy.

1637
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:20,063
When I eat your food,
it tastes like it was made with no love.

1638
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:23,358
Oh, this is ridiculous.
We always cook with love.

1639
01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:25,694
- Don't we?
- Yes, Chef!

1640
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:28,572
Everyone knows love
is the most important ingredient.

1641
01:29:28,655 --> 01:29:29,990
Then you're kidding yourself.

1642
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:34,160
Come on, Chef. I thought tonight
was a night of hard home truths.

1643
01:29:34,244 --> 01:29:35,245
This is one of them.

1644
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:38,039
You cook with obsession, not love.

1645
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,501
Even your hot dishes are cold.

1646
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:43,712
You're a chef.

1647
01:29:44,337 --> 01:29:47,132
Your single purpose on this Earth
is to serve people food

1648
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:49,968
that they might actually like,
and you have failed.

1649
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,012
You've failed.

1650
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:53,471
And you've bored me.

1651
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:56,516
And the worst part is
I'm still fucking hungry.

1652
01:29:57,851 --> 01:29:59,853
You're... You're still hungry?

1653
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:00,937
Yes, I am.

1654
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:04,566
How hungry?

1655
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:06,234
Starved.

1656
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:07,944
Well, what are you hungry for?

1657
01:30:08,028 --> 01:30:09,404
What do you have?

1658
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:10,488
Everything.

1659
01:30:12,115 --> 01:30:14,659
- You know what I'd really like?
- Tell me.

1660
01:30:15,827 --> 01:30:17,162
A cheeseburger.

1661
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:26,671
Yeah, we can do a cheeseburger.

1662
01:30:26,755 --> 01:30:28,506
A real cheeseburger.

1663
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:30,967
Not some fancy,
deconstructed avant bullshit.

1664
01:30:31,051 --> 01:30:32,886
A real cheeseburger.

1665
01:30:32,969 --> 01:30:36,139
Well, I'll make you a very good,
very traditional cheeseburger.

1666
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:37,349
I don't think you can.

1667
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:41,144
I'll make you feel as if you're eating
the first cheeseburger you ever ate.

1668
01:30:42,062 --> 01:30:44,731
The cheap one your parents
could barely afford.

1669
01:30:45,315 --> 01:30:47,192
- Show me.
- How do you like it?

1670
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:49,110
Medium. American cheese.

1671
01:30:49,194 --> 01:30:51,446
American cheese is the best cheese
for a cheeseburger,

1672
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:53,198
because it melts without splitting.

1673
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:54,491
How much will that set me back?

1674
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:55,742
$9.95.

1675
01:30:57,953 --> 01:30:59,245
That come with fries?

1676
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:01,164
- Niels.
- Yes, Chef?

1677
01:31:01,247 --> 01:31:03,166
- Is the fryer still on?
- Yes, Chef.

1678
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:06,962
Crinkle-cut or julienne?

1679
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,561
Hmm.

1680
01:32:54,402 --> 01:32:55,445
Mmm.

1681
01:33:01,326 --> 01:33:02,452
Now that...

1682
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:06,956
...is a cheeseburger.

1683
01:33:07,457 --> 01:33:09,084
Yeah.

1684
01:33:09,167 --> 01:33:10,835
That is a cheeseburger.

1685
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:18,301
Unfortunately, I think my eyes
were a little bigger than my stomach.

1686
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:22,722
Well, I understand.

1687
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:26,643
Can I get the rest to go?

1688
01:33:36,111 --> 01:33:37,403
One moment, please.

1689
01:33:54,712 --> 01:33:56,172
One cheeseburger to go.

1690
01:33:58,383 --> 01:33:59,551
And a gift bag.

1691
01:34:03,721 --> 01:34:05,682
Thank you for dining at Hawthorn.

1692
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:08,768
Thank you...

1693
01:34:10,603 --> 01:34:11,855
...for, um...

1694
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:17,902
For everything.

1695
01:35:10,997 --> 01:35:15,543
Before our final course,
there is the matter of the bill.

1696
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:19,380
We're on a no-tip system,
so gratuity is included.

1697
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:21,591
And please enjoy your gift bags.

1698
01:35:21,674 --> 01:35:24,219
Um... Some goodies in there.

1699
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:27,805
A booklet of our local suppliers,

1700
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:30,558
some house-made granola,

1701
01:35:31,434 --> 01:35:36,564
one of Doug Verrick's fingers,
and a copy of tonight's menu.

1702
01:35:40,318 --> 01:35:41,861
Oh! No, no.

1703
01:35:42,862 --> 01:35:43,988
It's on the magazine.

1704
01:35:54,332 --> 01:35:56,000
I told you you weren't leaving.

1705
01:36:03,383 --> 01:36:07,804
So, once again,
thank you for dining with us tonight.

1706
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:12,141
You represent the ruin of my art

1707
01:36:13,559 --> 01:36:14,769
and my life,

1708
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:18,273
and now you get to be a part of it.

1709
01:36:19,399 --> 01:36:23,736
A part of what I hope is my masterpiece.

1710
01:37:15,788 --> 01:37:17,749
And now, our final dessert course

1711
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:21,586
is a playful twist
on a comfort food classic.

1712
01:37:23,129 --> 01:37:24,630
The s'more.

1713
01:37:26,132 --> 01:37:29,844
The most offensive assault
on the human palate ever contrived.

1714
01:37:30,553 --> 01:37:33,222
Unethically sourced chocolate
and gelatinized sugar water

1715
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:36,559
imprisoned by industrial-grade
graham cracker.

1716
01:37:36,642 --> 01:37:41,189
It's everything wrong with us,
and yet we associate it with innocence.

1717
01:37:41,272 --> 01:37:42,482
With childhood.

1718
01:37:42,565 --> 01:37:43,900
<i>Mom and Dad.</i>

1719
01:37:44,984 --> 01:37:50,406
But what transforms
this fucking monstrosity is fire.

1720
01:37:50,490 --> 01:37:51,824
Oh, God.

1721
01:37:55,161 --> 01:37:57,080
The purifying flame.

1722
01:37:57,663 --> 01:38:00,166
It nourishes us, warms us,

1723
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:05,671
re-invents us, forges and destroys us.

1724
01:38:06,381 --> 01:38:08,424
We must embrace the flame.

1725
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:14,555
Jesus fucking Christ! Please.

1726
01:38:24,065 --> 01:38:26,150
We must be cleansed.

1727
01:38:27,276 --> 01:38:28,736
Made clean.

1728
01:38:30,321 --> 01:38:31,989
Like martyrs

1729
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:34,575
or heretics.

1730
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:37,787
We can be subsumed...

1731
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:41,040
...and made anew.

1732
01:38:41,124 --> 01:38:42,834
Thank you.

1733
01:38:54,345 --> 01:38:55,596
I love you all!

1734
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:57,682
We love you, Chef!
