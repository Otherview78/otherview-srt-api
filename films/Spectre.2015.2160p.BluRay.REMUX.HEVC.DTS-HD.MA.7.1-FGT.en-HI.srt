<i>If anything happens to me, 007,
I need you to do something.</i>

166
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:52,085
<i>Find a man
called Marco Sciarra.</i>

167
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,504
<i>Kill him.</i>

168
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:57,298
<i>And don't miss the funeral.</i>

169
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,803
Jesus.

170
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,138
Where did you get it?

171
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,724
In my mailbox
just after she died.

172
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,602
Well, she was never
short of surprises.

173
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,189
She wasn't gonna let death
get in the way of her job.

174
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,568
I've been tracking
Sciarra ever since.

175
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:18,987
And what have you found?

176
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,406
Nothing significant yet.

177
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:22,907
When's the funeral?

178
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,202
Three days. In Rome.

179
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:29,289
If you think M's signing off on
that, you're insane.

He won't let you
out of his sight.

181

Yes, it's a bit of
a problem.

Listen.

183
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,964
Could you do a little
quiet digging for me?

184
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,009
I heard a name in Mexico.
"The Pale King."

185
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,305
You want me
to be your mole.

186
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,099
Yes.

187
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,229
And what makes you think
you can trust me?

188
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:57,191
Instinct.

189
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:00,922
TANNER: Poor old girl.
Rigged for demolition in a week.

190
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,176
Cheaper to knock her down
than to rebuild.

191
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:06,928
Still.

192
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,514
Time waits for no man
and all that.

193
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:13,267
Anyway, all the money's
been spent on this,

194
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,854
the New Centre for
National Security.

195
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,691
BOND: So that's C's new digs.

196
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,527
You've met him, have you?

197
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,779
Yesterday.
What do we know about him?

198
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,989
Classic Whitehall mandarin.

199
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,241
Wrote a dossier last year

200
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,284
on how the double-0 program
was obsolete,

201
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:33,371
how drones could do
all our dirty work abroad.

202
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,248
Went to school with
the Home Secretary.

203
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,791
Of course, he did.

204
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:39,127
This merger's
just the start of it.

205
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,587
In three days, there's a security
conference in Tokyo

206
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,923
to decide
the New World Order.

207
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:46,175
If C gets his way,
he'll have unlimited access

208
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,970
to the combined intelligence
streams of nine countries.

209
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,304
Including us.

210
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,514
Quite.

211
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:03,151
Well, a lot's happened
while you were away.

212
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:07,321
A train bombing in Hamburg and an
industrial explosion in Tunisia.

213
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:08,823
It's not great timing
for us.

214
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,784
It's all rather
playing into C's hands.

215
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:15,746
M, well, let's say
he's feeling the pressure.

216
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,498
Yeah, I've noticed.

217
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:19,375
Now, this way, 007.

218
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,961
Be careful.
It's a trifle slippery.

219
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,175
Q wasn't exactly feeling
at home in Whitehall,

220
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,217
what with the new merger,

221
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:32,430
so he set up shop here,
away from prying eyes,
as it were.

222
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:35,349
I hear he's got something
rather special planned for you.

223
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,101
I can hardly wait.

bit up in the air,

227

and all.

228
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,872
Couple of things
to get through.

229
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,541
Shall we get started?

230
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,502

489
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:45,728
We will now vote
on the resolution.

490
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:49,148
Ladies and gentlemen,
please cast your vote.

491
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:56,489
The vote is eight
to one in favor.

492
00:51:56,906 --> 00:51:58,658
However, as you know,

493
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:01,661
we cannot proceed
unless by unanimous vote.

494
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:04,914
The Nine Eyes motion
is therefore not passed.

495
00:52:05,832 --> 00:52:06,999
Democracy.

496

00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:33,401
Um, I'll just take
a look now, sir.

503
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,361
Because if he isn't,
you're in deep shit.

00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,788
I have him, sir.
He appears to be in Chelsea.

507
00:52:45,872 --> 00:52:49,208
Well, I want eyes on him
when I get back, understood?

508
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,627
I completely understand,

Upstairs, Mr. White.

515
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:05,488
I always knew death would
wear a familiar face,

516
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,073
but not yours.

517
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:10,076
To what do I owe
this pleasure, Mr. Bond?

518
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:14,747
I was at a meeting recently

519
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,707
and your name came up.

520
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:19,794
I'm flattered London is
still talking about me.

521
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,337
It wasn't MI6.

522
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:23,714
It was Rome.

523
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:26,884
Your team, not mine.

524
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:28,260
Ah.

525
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:37,269
Last month,
I found thallium in my cell phone.

526
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:41,899
It's done its job.
I have a few weeks.
Maybe less.

527
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:47,321
So, here we are, Mr. Bond,

528
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,449
two dead men
enjoying the evening.

529
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,743
What did you do?

530
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:54,412
I disobeyed him.

531
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:58,249
I followed him
as far as I could.

532
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:00,209
He changed.

533
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:01,877
Oh, I see.

534
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,213
You grew a conscience.

535
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:07,716
Our game is our game.
But this?

536
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,928
Women, children...

537
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:12,847
Well, the thallium
would suggest

538
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,974
that he doesn't like you
very much anymore.

539
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:16,976
And clearly
the feeling is mutual.

540
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:19,228
So why don't you tell me
how to find him again?

541
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:20,312
Oh, come on.

542
00:57:21,397 --> 00:57:22,857
Tell me where he is.

543
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,650
He's everywhere.

544
00:57:24,984 --> 00:57:26,026
Everywhere!

545
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:28,320
He's sitting
at your desk,

546
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:31,574
he's kissing your lover,
he's eating supper with your family!

Your daughter.

554
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:00,311
You won't find her.

555
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:01,854
She's clever.

556
00:58:01,896 --> 00:58:05,024
She's smarter than me.
She knows how to hide.

557
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:09,111
I can protect her if
you tell me where he is.

(CHUCKLES)

559
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,449
I can keep her alive.

C: Good God,
the government couldn't
afford this kind of facility.

01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:32,796
No, it was benefactors mostly,
from the private sector.

My commiserations
on losing the Nine Eyes vote.

582
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:48,854
Must have been a blow.

583
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:51,148
Not really.
Only a matter of time

584
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:52,441
before the South Africans
see the light.

585
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:54,735
And you know what they say,
Rome wasn't built in a day.

586
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:55,819
Day and a half maybe.

587
01:00:56,862 --> 01:01:00,032
Look, Max, I know surveillance
is a fact of life.

588
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:04,244
It's how you use the
information that concerns me,

589
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:05,788
and who is using it.

590
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:07,998
This is what we need to do
to keep the people safe.

Come on, M.
You can't really tell me
that one man in the field

593
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:16,256
can compete with all of this,

594
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:19,051
running around out there
with his license to kill.

595
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:22,304
Have you ever had
to kill a man, Max?

596
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:25,140
Have you?

597
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:27,893
To pull that trigger,
you have to be sure.

598
01:01:28,227 --> 01:01:31,980
Yes, you investigate,
analyze, assess, target.

599
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:35,192
And then you have
to look him in the eye.

600
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,278
And you make the call.

601

cameras, transcripts,

all the surveillance
in the world

603
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:46,453
can't tell you
what to do next.

604
01:01:48,414 --> 01:01:50,165
A license to kill

605
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:53,752
is also a license
not to kill.

606
01:01:55,671 --> 01:01:58,090
I didn't want to
have to do this,

607

can't control your agents.

I hope you don't mind.
The view can be distracting.

I hadn't noticed.

629

I see you filled out
most of the paperwork.

Just a few questions to complete
your evaluation, if I may.

Do you consider your employment
to be psychologically stressful?

Sometimes.

635

How much alcohol
do you consume?

Too much.

As a child, would you say you
were close to your parents?

My parents died
when I was young.

Really? How old?

641
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:55,601
Old enough to remember.

642
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:57,394
How, if I may ask?

643

It was a climbing accident.

644

So who brought you up?

Forgive me,
but anyone might think

651
01:05:17,456 --> 01:05:19,124
you were hiding
from something.

652
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,378
You're paying a lot of money to be
here, Mr. Bond.

Who's asking the questions,
you or me?

654
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:27,966
Of course. Carry on.

655

What is your occupation?

657
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:40,354
Well, that's not the sort of
thing that looks good on a form.

658
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:41,647
And why is that?

665
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:57,829
Because I was there.

666
01:05:58,413 --> 01:05:59,498
Did you kill him?

667
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:00,624
I didn't have to.

668
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:03,001
He did it himself.

669
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:06,838
And you came all the way
just to tell me this?

670
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,882
That my father's dead?

671
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:12,970
I came to tell you that your life
is in danger and I need your help.

672
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:16,848
- Why?
- I made a deal with him
to protect you.

673
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:19,476
You're lying.

674
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:21,353
Why would he trust you?

675
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:24,481
Because he knew that I
needed something in return.

676
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:26,108
And what was that?

677

Can I get you
something, sir?

684
01:07:05,856 --> 01:07:08,358
Vodka martini.
Shaken, not stirred.

685

I'm sorry,
we don't serve alcohol.

Certainly.

If you've come
for the car,

690
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:20,871
I parked it
at the bottom of the Tiber.

691
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:23,915
Well, not to worry, 007.
It was only a £3,000,000 prototype.

692
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:25,375
Why are you here, Q?

693
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:27,377
Oh, I just fancied a break,
to be honest.

694
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:29,254
I've been a tad stressed
at work recently.

695
01:07:29,588 --> 01:07:31,548
What with C's people
crawling all over us

696
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:33,550
and the fact that M wants my
balls for Christmas decorations.

697
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:35,761
- Get to the point.
- The point, 007,

698
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:37,929
is that Franz Oberhauser
is dead.

699
01:07:38,013 --> 01:07:39,514
Dead and buried.

700
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:40,932
And unless you come back
with me right now,

701
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,935
my career and Moneypenny's
will go the same way.

702
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,938
Do you understand?
All hell is breaking
loose out there and...

703
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,608
- I saw him.
- You thought you saw him.

704
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:51,276
We've been through
the records.

705
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,987
He died in an avalanche
with his father 20 years ago.

706
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:56,031
Yes. I know that.

707
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:57,532
But I saw him.

708
01:07:59,618 --> 01:08:01,578
He's not someone
I'll ever forget.

709
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,248
So you have a lead?

710
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:07,084
I have a name.
<i>L'Américain.</i>

711

(SCOFFS) Well,

712
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:12,380
Look, I'm sorry, 007,
but time's up.

713
01:08:12,464 --> 01:08:14,508
My whole career
is on the line here.

714
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:17,010
Either you come back in and do
this through proper channels,

715
01:08:17,094 --> 01:08:18,261
or I go directly to M.

Sir, we can't
just desert Bond.

We have to.
We only make him weaker.

Good afternoon,
Mr. Bond, Dr. Swann.

I want you to know just how excited
we all are to finally meet you.

Well,
it's a pleasure to be here.

976

Your host invites
you both to rest,

977
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:25,877

- Tell our host we won't be late.
- MAN: Wonderful.

979
01:39:28,838 --> 01:39:31,591
Before we show you to your
rooms, just one more thing.

980
01:39:39,349 --> 01:39:40,517
Oh.

981
01:39:43,269 --> 01:39:44,938
You be careful
with that.

982
01:39:45,814 --> 01:39:47,315

983

you enter it alone.

986

if you want.

994

Do you know what it is?

995
01:42:06,996 --> 01:42:08,665
It's a meteorite.

The Kartenhoff.
The oldest in human possession.

998
01:42:16,965 --> 01:42:19,801
The very meteorite
which made this crater.

999
01:42:21,636 --> 01:42:22,846
Think about it.

1000
01:42:23,513 --> 01:42:27,142
So many years up there,
alone, silent,

1001
01:42:28,309 --> 01:42:32,230
building momentum until it
chose to make its mark on Earth.

1002
01:42:34,023 --> 01:42:36,734
A huge, unstoppable force.

1003
01:42:37,318 --> 01:42:39,654
Except it did stop,
didn't it?

1004
01:42:40,155 --> 01:42:41,531
Right here.

1005
01:42:56,004 --> 01:42:59,883
I can't tell you how much I've
been looking forward to this.

All of us here, together.

1007
01:43:05,013 --> 01:43:06,556
A reunion.

I'm so glad you came,
too, dear Madeleine.

You were just a girl
when I saw you first.

1010
01:43:17,567 --> 01:43:20,528
I came to your home once
to see your father.

1011

I don't remember that.

For example,

01:44:03,404 --> 01:44:06,282
So, James,
why did you come?

1023
01:44:06,783 --> 01:44:08,451
I came here to kill you.

1024
01:44:09,452 --> 01:44:11,788
And I thought you
came here to die.

1025
01:44:12,121 --> 01:44:14,165
Well, it's all
a matter of perspective.

Oh, I think I do.

1043
01:45:25,194 --> 01:45:27,989
You set cities on fire and
watch innocent people burn,

1044
01:45:28,031 --> 01:45:30,241
so you can convince
governments to join

1045

you've paid for.

And what does
he get out of it?

1050

Nothing.

He's a visionary,
like me.

it was coincidence

that all the women in
your life ended up dead?

He didn't lose his mind,
he was just weak.

But at least he understood

A man can watch himself
being disemboweled

Why are you doing this?

1139
01:51:41,696 --> 01:51:43,864
You probably know
that James here

1140
01:51:43,906 --> 01:51:46,033
lost his parents
when he was young.

1141
01:51:49,370 --> 01:51:51,831
But did you know
that it was my father

1142
01:51:51,914 --> 01:51:54,291
who helped him through
this difficult time?

1143
01:52:02,466 --> 01:52:04,468
Over the course
of two winters

1144
01:52:04,552 --> 01:52:08,764
he taught him to ski,
and climb, and hunt.

1145
01:52:09,557 --> 01:52:13,936
He soothed the wounds of the
poor little blue-eyed orphan.

(PANTING)

him as a brother.

My little brother.

1149
01:52:23,112 --> 01:52:25,114
They formed
quite an attachment.

1150
01:52:26,782 --> 01:52:27,908
So,

1151
01:52:28,743 --> 01:52:29,952
you killed him.

1152
01:52:31,454 --> 01:52:32,955
Yes, I did.

1153
01:52:36,459 --> 01:52:39,128
You know what
happens when a cuckoo

1154

1155

Yes.

It forces
the other eggs out.

OBERHAUSER: Yes.

1158
01:52:49,472 --> 01:52:54,477
Well, this cuckoo made me realize
my father's life had to end.

1159
01:52:55,811 --> 01:52:58,397
In a way, he's responsible
for the path I took.

So, thank you.

Franz Oberhauser died
20 years ago, James.

In an avalanche,
alongside his father.

1167

You won't know
who she is.

1176

Just another passing face
on your way to the grave.

He dies not knowing
who you are.

The daughter
of an assassin.

1179

The only one who could
have understood him.
