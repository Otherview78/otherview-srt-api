1
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:24,933
You murderers! It's easy to gun us down! We only got rocks!

2
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:29,103
H A T E

3
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,825
This film is dedicated to friends and family

4
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:45,245
who died while it was in the making.

5
00:00:46,996 --> 00:00:50,416
Heard about the guy who fell off a skyscraper?

6
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:53,503
On his way down past each floor,

7
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,089
he kept saying to reassure himself:

8
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:59,008
"So far so good...

9
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,678
"so far so good..."

10
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:08,268
How you fall doesn't matter.

11
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:11,479
It's how you land!

12
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:48,071
More rioting in the projects outside the city.

13
00:04:48,238 --> 00:04:50,240
Last night a mob of youths

14
00:04:50,573 --> 00:04:52,575
attacked a police station

15
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:54,869
in the Muguet projects.

16
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:58,039
Pitched battles left 14 officers injured.

17
00:04:58,206 --> 00:04:59,999
33 arrests were made.

18
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,878
A mall and nearby buildings were damaged by looters

19
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:06,381
who dispersed around 4 a.m.

20
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:10,510
Alleged police brutality sparked the riots 2 days ago.

21
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:14,472
A local teen was severely beaten under questioning.

22
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,224
The officer was suspended.

23
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:20,436
The victim, Abdel Ichaha, is in hospital

24
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:22,355
in critical condition.

25
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:06,566
Got a looter under arrest, a minor.

26
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:34,969
FUCK THE POLICE

27
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:44,187
Vinz! Where the fuck is he?

28
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,689
- What? - What do you mean "what"?

29
00:06:46,856 --> 00:06:48,691
Can't fucking say hello?

30
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,777
Chill, Sayid. What's up?

31
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,862
Tell your bro to come out.

32
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:55,198
- What for? - Tell him!

33
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:57,742
- What for? - Just tell him!

34
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:59,327
What for?

35
00:06:59,994 --> 00:07:01,579
Is this a TV game show?

36
00:07:01,746 --> 00:07:04,332
Quit hollering!

37
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:08,086
You guys made enough noise last night!

38
00:07:08,545 --> 00:07:11,381
You see me last night? I wasn't here.

39
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:12,674
Shut up!

40
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,467
Don't play dumb!

41
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,928
- You'll burn next, asshole! - Idiot!

42
00:07:18,012 --> 00:07:20,807
- You going to get him? - Don't asshole me, asshole!

43
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,268
You still there? Beat it!

44
00:07:23,935 --> 00:07:26,813
If I wake him, he'll get mad. You try!

45
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,482
I hope the cops tan your hide!

46
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,666
Vinz...

47
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,836
Shut up, Sayid.

48
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:54,090
Shut up? Be nice or you're history, fuckface!

49
00:07:54,257 --> 00:07:56,634
Go away. You stink!

50
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:59,804
You want to play this early? One...

51
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:00,763
Two...

52
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,098
Three.

53
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:04,142
You lose.

54
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:05,810
Fuck your sister.

55
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:08,730
I told you not to talk about her!

56
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:11,065
She sucks Donald Duck. Get lost!

57
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:11,900
Jew boy!

58
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:15,486
You bogus kike, you're nowhere!

59
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:17,906
- I saw a cow. - What?

60
00:08:18,072 --> 00:08:18,990
A cow.

61
00:08:19,157 --> 00:08:20,283
Got some smoke?

62
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,868
In the box.

63
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:29,334
Last night, during the riot, I dashed behind a building:

64
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,128
Wham! I ran right into a cow.

65
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:33,379
Really?

66
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:36,007
Stop smoking, your brain's fried!

67
00:08:36,174 --> 00:08:38,593
Off my bed! I'll say you're taking drugs!

68
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,221
I'll cut your throat, hang you up,

69
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,098
you'll drown in your blood!

70
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:45,225
Granma!

71
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:48,811
Get off the bed.

72
00:08:49,604 --> 00:08:50,605
You get out.

73
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:51,981
Stay off my bed!

74
00:08:53,441 --> 00:08:55,568
Get lost, you snitch!

75
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,654
Move it.

76
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,031
Watch your mouth with my sister!

77
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:02,575
- Got any salt? - Respect your Granma!

78
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:03,910
You my father?

79
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,328
What about Dad?

80
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:08,164
You my mother now?

81
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:10,250
Go to school!

82
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,252
It burned down.

83
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,337
Burned down! Savages!

84
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:18,007
Start that way and soon you'll skip temple!

85
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:20,093
- Granma! - What?

86
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,469
I didn't burn the school!

87
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:24,472
And you don't go to temple!

88
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,808
You win! I surrender!

89
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:29,435
If everyone ran from an argument,

90
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,688
there'd be a stampede, already!

91
00:09:31,854 --> 00:09:34,607
But we'd all be going the same way!

92
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:36,067
Mazeltov!

93
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:38,069
You talking to me?

94
00:09:56,087 --> 00:10:00,008
You talking to me, mothafucka!

95
00:10:10,226 --> 00:10:14,230
...the guy says: "For cash, I'd even murder!"

96
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:17,775
He tells his friend: "I'd even waste you."

97
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:20,069
The friend freaks, so the guy says:

98
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:22,822
"Don't worry, you're a buddy.

99
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:26,659
"I won't waste you for cash, I'll do it for free!"

100
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,245
What a killer line! "For free!"

101
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:32,999
"I'll waste you for free!" What a line, Vinz!

102
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,250
I got it the first time.

103
00:10:34,417 --> 00:10:37,253
Tell your brother to come see me!

104
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,299
What a killer put-down! "I'll waste you for free!"

105
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:43,635
Shut up and gimme the joint.

106
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,474
- A killer line! - Killer.

107
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:54,771
"I'd waste you for free." Can't do better than that!

108
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,400
Why you so uptight?

109
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,324
Mothafucka!

110
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,913
Bastards wrecked everything!

111
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:16,960
Check that!

112
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:24,384
I don't believe it!

113
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:28,304
How'd they get the car in?

114
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:31,724
The doorway's too narrow.

115
00:11:32,934 --> 00:11:35,186
Chill, Sayid! There he is.

116
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:37,897
He must be pissed off.

117
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:42,068
Took him two years to get this gym!

118
00:11:57,876 --> 00:12:00,003
Your dope's good, Vinz.

119
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,381
Not mine. It's Hubert's.

120
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:10,597
Don't bogart, Sayid.

121
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,432
Thought you quit smoking?

122
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,017
Me too.

123
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:18,187
What happened here?

124
00:12:18,354 --> 00:12:19,689
Guess.

125
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,399
A fire?

126
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,069
You win the prize, Einstein!

127
00:12:25,236 --> 00:12:26,738
Kiss mine, cousin!

128
00:12:26,905 --> 00:12:29,365
I knew it'd go up in smoke one day.

129
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:31,951
So why'd you bust ass to get it?

130
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,204
'Cause he wanted to, dickface!

131
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,622
You're the dick.

132
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,498
You know who did it?

133
00:12:37,707 --> 00:12:39,459
I don't want to know.

134
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:43,379
How'd the car get in here?

135
00:12:43,922 --> 00:12:46,257
The doorway's not big enough.

136
00:12:54,015 --> 00:12:56,768
We dissed them, spit on them!

137
00:12:56,935 --> 00:12:59,646
But the cops didn't move an inch.

138
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:03,942
Then the mothers stepped aside to make a path...

139
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:14,869
Then these plainclothes pigs came out with wooden clubs.

140
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:18,039
They hit a homeboy, like real bad!

141
00:13:18,206 --> 00:13:21,000
Kept clubbing him till we tore into 'em.

142
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,587
I kicked a pig right in the head!

143
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:36,766
That's a Yamaha.

144
00:13:37,267 --> 00:13:39,561
More like your Mom on a Harley!

145
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:42,480
It's Mohammed's bike. He fixed the exhaust.

146
00:13:42,647 --> 00:13:45,233
No, it's Vinz's Mom on a Yamaha!

147
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,818
Which Mohammad?

148
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,654
Farida's brother?

149
00:13:49,821 --> 00:13:51,906
Farida with the driver's license?

150
00:13:52,073 --> 00:13:54,325
No, Farida from the supermarket.

151
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:58,037
Anyway, it was a scene.

152
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:02,333
You should've been there Hubert. It was intense.

153
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:06,170
Tear gas, 2 nights in a cop shop,

154
00:14:06,337 --> 00:14:08,089
all the fists you can eat,

155
00:14:08,256 --> 00:14:10,008
getting hell at home:

156
00:14:10,174 --> 00:14:13,761
Sorry cousin, but I am not buying!

157
00:14:14,596 --> 00:14:19,684
Gimme a break! It was war against the pigs, in living color!

158
00:14:19,851 --> 00:14:23,062
I was trying to make some cash.

159
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,899
Your bogus riot fucked it up!

160
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:29,736
When a brother goes down, I stand up!

161
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,281
What brother? Do I know the guy?

162
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:38,328
I won't take hits for a homeboy gangster I don't know.

163
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:42,749
Let's go.

164
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,084
I mean it!

165
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,961
Abdel's no gangster.

166
00:14:47,128 --> 00:14:50,965
OK, but I'm not faster than a speeding bullet!

167
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,682
Hey, hands off the hot dogs!

168
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:00,892
Gimme one.

169
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:02,310
And go broke?

170
00:15:02,477 --> 00:15:03,937
Don't make us cry!

171
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:06,814
I'll make you cry, Sayid!

172
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,067
Everyone pays the same!

173
00:15:09,234 --> 00:15:11,528
Except Hubert, it's his building.

174
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:12,695
A buck?

175
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:14,906
A buck for one, OK two!

176
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:18,034
You're a drag!

177
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:19,577
You should try one.

178
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:21,996
- Got a buck? - Yeah, for me!

179
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:22,830
Here.

180
00:15:22,997 --> 00:15:26,251
No way, I'll remember this!

181
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:28,169
- So remember. - Never forget.

182
00:15:30,088 --> 00:15:32,507
Don't be a jerk. I'll pay later.

183
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:36,719
How? With your sister?

184
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:39,222
Don't talk that way about her!

185
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:41,558
Chill out, you bogus Arab!

186
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:44,811
Sayid! Come back with that!

187
00:15:52,026 --> 00:15:53,319
Got any change?

188
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:55,738
We're broke!

189
00:15:56,364 --> 00:15:58,241
- 2 bits. - We're broke.

190
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:01,578
...The judge says I go to jail,

191
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:03,538
or do jobs for the City.

192
00:16:03,705 --> 00:16:06,040
Community service? The pits!

193
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:09,168
Ever do it? Jail's bad enough!

194
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,170
You'd rather do time?

195
00:16:11,462 --> 00:16:13,047
Your bro stole a dog!

196
00:16:13,214 --> 00:16:15,550
- Liar! - His mouth is full!

197
00:16:15,717 --> 00:16:17,135
Put it on my tab.

198
00:16:17,302 --> 00:16:19,178
Liar! Your nose is growing!

199
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:21,848
I'll bust your nose, Sayid!

200
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:24,934
Beat it!

201
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:38,489
A.45!

202
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:41,409
Like the gun in "Lethal Weapon."

203
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:45,622
We saw that movie together! It was a 9mm. Glock!

204
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:48,124
- What? - No, it wasn't!

205
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,418
That was a Desert Eagle.

206
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:54,464
He shot at the truck!

207
00:16:54,631 --> 00:16:56,883
That wasn't "Lethal Weapon"!

208
00:16:57,342 --> 00:17:00,303
What are you talking about?

209
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,642
A cop lost his handgun during the riot.

210
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:07,435
That's a good one!

211
00:17:07,602 --> 00:17:12,148
I don't know the pig who lost his piece.

212
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:15,443
But I'd like to know who found it!

213
00:17:16,152 --> 00:17:17,237
No joke!

214
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:24,536
...I'll sleep, eat, lift weights.

215
00:17:24,702 --> 00:17:27,288
Everyone's been inside, except me.

216
00:17:28,206 --> 00:17:30,667
A month for theft is pathetic!

217
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:32,377
Not in your league!

218
00:17:32,544 --> 00:17:36,548
- What league? I was never inside! - You got nabbed.

219
00:17:37,715 --> 00:17:38,758
I quit in time!

220
00:17:39,968 --> 00:17:40,843
Come look!

221
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,845
We got visitors.

222
00:17:43,012 --> 00:17:45,139
Over here!

223
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,642
It's the mayor!

224
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:52,063
Up Your Honor, Mr. Mayor! Mothafucka!

225
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:56,901
Cut the stereo!

226
00:17:57,068 --> 00:18:00,947
Who's in charge here? You, Nordeen?

227
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,950
What's going on here?

228
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,369
Think you're in Disneyland?

229
00:18:06,536 --> 00:18:09,789
You're not allowed up here. You got to go down.

230
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,249
We're causing no trouble.

231
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:15,420
Still, you've got to get off the roof.

232
00:18:15,587 --> 00:18:17,213
We like it up here.

233
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,631
Off the roof.

234
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:22,927
You learn that shit at Notre Dame?

235
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:28,016
Cut it out! Quiet everyone!

236
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:34,647
- I'll handle this! - Forget it!

237
00:18:34,856 --> 00:18:36,774
You can't stay here!

238
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:40,820
So fold your little tents, grab your chairs...

239
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:43,781
and let's all go downstairs nice and easy.

240
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:44,782
OK!

241
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:47,118
Who's going to make us leave?

242
00:18:47,285 --> 00:18:50,413
Your goons or you, in your little uniform?

243
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,874
Nordeen, we're doing our job.

244
00:18:56,252 --> 00:18:57,837
Leave us alone!

245
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:03,384
Don't talk to me like that, I don't know you.

246
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,552
Now get lost!

247
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:06,054
Sitting duck!

248
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:08,389
Your mother drinks Bud!

249
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,858
Anyone who wants to stay, stay! Heat's off.

250
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:21,861
- I'm staying - You're going.

251
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,988
Let me stay, Nordeen.

252
00:19:24,155 --> 00:19:26,324
- What did I say? - You said go.

253
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:28,451
- So what do you do? - I go!

254
00:19:29,827 --> 00:19:31,829
OK, I'm going!

255
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:33,957
Vinz, come on!

256
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,293
Don't play tough guy!

257
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,796
You always wimp out!

258
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,400
...You see 'em in porn stores.

259
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:01,985
What are they called?

260
00:20:02,151 --> 00:20:03,319
G-strings.

261
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:05,196
- What? - G-strings, moron.

262
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:07,907
She had one on, I swear it.

263
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,826
I fucked her like an animal.

264
00:20:09,993 --> 00:20:12,078
We were in the room...

265
00:20:13,997 --> 00:20:16,749
she kept screaming for more.

266
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,503
Guy next door pounded the wall we were so noisy.

267
00:20:21,337 --> 00:20:24,007
You dreamt you fucked her!

268
00:20:24,382 --> 00:20:26,301
What?

269
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:29,262
- You know the bitch? - I know her, she has AIDS.

270
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:32,098
Get outta here!

271
00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:34,642
- Hi, we're from TV. - What's this?

272
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:36,895
Were you in the riot last night?

273
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:38,646
Did you break things, burn cars?

274
00:20:38,813 --> 00:20:42,400
- We look like looters, lady? - I didn't say that.

275
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:44,777
- So what do we look like? - Nothing special.

276
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:47,697
Get out the car! This is not Thoiry.

277
00:20:47,989 --> 00:20:49,574
We got work to do.

278
00:20:49,741 --> 00:20:53,286
What kind of work? Stirring up shit?

279
00:20:53,536 --> 00:20:55,622
- For a juicy scoop! - No camera!

280
00:20:56,664 --> 00:21:00,001
Quit snooping in the 'hood, fuckface! Stop taping!

281
00:21:00,835 --> 00:21:02,545
Quit taping, dickhead!

282
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,964
This is not Thoiry!

283
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,636
What's with all the assholes today?

284
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:12,597
That fucking broad...

285
00:21:16,184 --> 00:21:17,393
What's Thoiry?

286
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,854
A drive-in safari park.

287
00:21:21,272 --> 00:21:22,941
This is not a zoo!

288
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:26,361
Open up, WalMart!

289
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,531
You fucking jerks.

290
00:21:29,697 --> 00:21:31,950
Talk nice, we're in France.

291
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,621
It's 1 p.m. And you're in bed?

292
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,751
What's with the hair net?

293
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:43,836
Lay off!

294
00:21:44,546 --> 00:21:46,839
You a movie star, WalMart?

295
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:48,675
What's this shitty TV?

296
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,593
Watch where you sit!

297
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,095
Just sweat pants!

298
00:21:52,262 --> 00:21:54,973
Where's the new TV?

299
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:56,349
It's too big to move.

300
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:59,686
I came by for my cash. Where were you?

301
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,897
I don't have it.

302
00:22:03,064 --> 00:22:05,316
Don't you know what happened?

303
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:09,904
Go see what your pals did.

304
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,789
Foued's brother did that.

305
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:20,874
So what?

306
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,084
Give me his address.

307
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:26,629
Look what he did to my car!

308
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:28,631
Look what he did!

309
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:31,092
Just look!

310
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:33,261
Leave that alone.

311
00:22:33,428 --> 00:22:37,682
I lost ten grand! I can't work now.

312
00:22:37,849 --> 00:22:40,810
WalMart, it's just a car!

313
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:44,147
That's what you say!

314
00:22:44,314 --> 00:22:46,149
You don't realize.

315
00:22:46,316 --> 00:22:48,443
It's all I got.

316
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,570
Cut it out!

317
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,863
Leave that alone!

318
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,781
A homeboy's dying, fuck your car!

319
00:22:53,948 --> 00:22:57,493
"A homeboy!" Big deal!

320
00:22:57,952 --> 00:22:59,412
You disgust me!

321
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:02,790
That car's all I have. It's my life!

322
00:23:02,957 --> 00:23:07,128
- They're showing the riot! - My car's more important!

323
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:08,588
Look, the riot.

324
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:10,465
- Some TV! - Sure, bust it!

325
00:23:10,632 --> 00:23:13,927
- Fix the antenna! - I'm trying!

326
00:23:14,135 --> 00:23:14,886
It's David!

327
00:23:15,303 --> 00:23:16,846
How'd he get on TV?

328
00:23:17,013 --> 00:23:19,766
I was over there, they missed me!

329
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:23,770
- Fix it! I can't see a thing! - This TV sucks!

330
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:27,315
How'd that fucker get on TV?

331
00:23:28,316 --> 00:23:30,610
Hey, gimme my money!

332
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:32,779
I don't have it. Snoopy has it.

333
00:23:32,946 --> 00:23:36,074
Gimme my coat and get outta my face!

334
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:38,284
You guys must be happy.

335
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:41,037
A cop lost his gun in the riot.

336
00:23:43,665 --> 00:23:45,583
I hope the guy who finds it

337
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,169
uses it uptown, not here for once!

338
00:23:48,336 --> 00:23:49,003
Forget it,

339
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,797
we'll get even!

340
00:23:55,677 --> 00:23:58,346
You know that show, "Candid Camera"?

341
00:23:58,596 --> 00:24:02,433
So this celebrity's sure he's been set up.

342
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:07,063
His buddy's fixed it with the camera guys.

343
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,649
The celebrity thinks they're out to get him.

344
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:12,443
He always eats in the same joint.

345
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,697
He's sure they'll film him there.

346
00:24:15,864 --> 00:24:19,534
The others convince him there's a hidden camera.

347
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:23,329
He sees the TV truck, a camera behind the mirror

348
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:26,958
and the guy with him pretends to act weird.

349
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:30,587
The celebrity thinks he'll fool 'em,

350
00:24:30,753 --> 00:24:34,799
pretending he hasn't noticed.

351
00:24:34,966 --> 00:24:38,428
He thinks all hell will break loose.

352
00:24:38,595 --> 00:24:43,308
But they just film him, jumpy, waiting for shit to happen.

353
00:24:43,474 --> 00:24:44,809
So you see this guy...

354
00:24:44,976 --> 00:24:47,145
Cut it out, Sayid!

355
00:24:47,312 --> 00:24:49,731
- Wasn't me! - Then who?

356
00:24:49,898 --> 00:24:54,235
The celebrity's sweating, trying to act cool.

357
00:24:54,402 --> 00:24:57,155
Each time the waiter passes

358
00:24:57,322 --> 00:24:59,199
he thinks it'll happen.

359
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:03,203
Then a guy asks him for his autograph.

360
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,455
The celeb thinks it's a trick

361
00:25:05,622 --> 00:25:08,082
and starts ranting at the guy,

362
00:25:08,249 --> 00:25:12,837
who doesn't know what's up, so he gets mad.

363
00:25:13,004 --> 00:25:15,924
They start fighting,

364
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,676
and the Candid Camera guys have to break it up.

365
00:25:18,843 --> 00:25:21,638
It was a killer punch out.

366
00:25:23,056 --> 00:25:24,390
Then what?

367
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:27,268
That's all.

368
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:42,325
Who was the celebrity?

369
00:25:42,492 --> 00:25:44,744
Don't know, but he was real famous.

370
00:25:45,161 --> 00:25:46,496
I don't remember.

371
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:05,014
This looks like trouble. See ya.

372
00:26:20,321 --> 00:26:22,490
WE'RE THE FUTURE

373
00:26:36,254 --> 00:26:37,797
What did they want?

374
00:26:38,548 --> 00:26:41,134
"Don't get mad, get even."

375
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:45,221
It's Abdel's brother. He's got a pump gun.

376
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,849
Party time!

377
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:55,273
We go visit Abdel in the hospital?

378
00:26:59,736 --> 00:27:01,613
I got to show you something...

379
00:27:09,913 --> 00:27:12,749
That's real steel!

380
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:15,627
- Get a load of it. - What a mother!

381
00:27:25,303 --> 00:27:26,512
What'll you do with it?

382
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:27,722
Stop it, Hubert.

383
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:28,890
What are you going to do with it?

384
00:27:29,057 --> 00:27:30,934
Depends if Abdel dies.

385
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,102
You going to kill a cop?

386
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:34,896
Best way to get respect!

387
00:27:35,063 --> 00:27:37,690
Smoking a cop will get you respect?

388
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:39,901
It will even up the score.

389
00:27:40,068 --> 00:27:43,238
- I could have got you a piece. - This one's special.

390
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,073
Think you're on a mission?

391
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,035
Well, I did find the gun. Leave me alone!

392
00:27:49,202 --> 00:27:52,413
- Will it help Abdel? - It'll help us.

393
00:27:55,124 --> 00:27:56,209
Stop fronting!

394
00:27:56,376 --> 00:27:57,835
You pussy!

395
00:27:58,044 --> 00:27:59,546
You're headed for big shit!

396
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:01,464
I'll do my thing, you do yours.

397
00:28:01,631 --> 00:28:05,134
- I don't want to know. - So don't ask!

398
00:28:09,097 --> 00:28:10,932
One thing's sure...

399
00:28:11,474 --> 00:28:14,394
with that piece you're the big man.

400
00:28:21,442 --> 00:28:23,403
Hey, wait for me!

401
00:28:33,872 --> 00:28:35,290
Fuck it...

402
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,965
What the fuck you doing?

403
00:28:44,132 --> 00:28:47,093
OK, don't have a shit fit!

404
00:29:21,002 --> 00:29:22,712
Sorry, fellas, you can't go in.

405
00:29:22,879 --> 00:29:24,589
Let us in. We came to see Abdel.

406
00:29:24,756 --> 00:29:26,674
Sorry, I have my orders.

407
00:29:26,841 --> 00:29:30,386
Just a couple of minutes. Then we'll leave.

408
00:29:30,553 --> 00:29:32,013
He's our friend.

409
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:36,059
The docs won't let you in. He's in a coma.

410
00:29:36,226 --> 00:29:37,852
We won't make trouble!

411
00:29:38,478 --> 00:29:40,480
If I let you in,

412
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:42,815
- I'll lose my job. - Sure, flunkey!

413
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:45,860
Tone it down. His family's here.

414
00:29:46,027 --> 00:29:48,154
They need peace and quiet!

415
00:29:48,321 --> 00:29:51,699
We're not as good as reporters?

416
00:29:51,866 --> 00:29:53,117
Get going!

417
00:29:53,785 --> 00:29:55,411
Hands off, man!

418
00:29:56,246 --> 00:29:58,373
You going to make me leave?

419
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,708
Going to shoot me? Pull out your pop gun!

420
00:30:02,252 --> 00:30:03,836
What's going on here?

421
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:05,547
Look at that fuckface!

422
00:30:06,506 --> 00:30:09,133
We came to see our pal Abdel!

423
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,512
We won't leave till we see him.

424
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:14,681
Beat it, before I take you in.

425
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:15,974
Oh, yeah?

426
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,433
You shut up!

427
00:30:19,602 --> 00:30:20,478
Move 'em out!

428
00:30:24,858 --> 00:30:28,361
We can be nice or nasty. It's up to you!

429
00:30:30,446 --> 00:30:31,906
Calm down!

430
00:30:32,407 --> 00:30:35,034
Lieut., these kids made trouble.

431
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:37,287
I got the ringleader.

432
00:30:38,663 --> 00:30:40,373
- He did nothing. - I arrested the leader.

433
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,417
- What leader? - He means Sayid.

434
00:30:42,584 --> 00:30:43,459
Sure, Uncle Tom!

435
00:30:53,011 --> 00:30:55,138
Things aren't bad enough.

436
00:30:55,305 --> 00:30:57,515
You had to go to the hospital?

437
00:30:58,016 --> 00:30:59,309
They were only doing their job.

438
00:30:59,475 --> 00:31:01,102
Doing their job?

439
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:03,938
Shut your yap, once and for all!

440
00:31:04,105 --> 00:31:06,441
- You shut yours! - Don't talk to me like that!

441
00:31:06,608 --> 00:31:09,319
- Same to you! - Shut up, will ya!

442
00:31:09,485 --> 00:31:10,695
Shit!

443
00:31:10,862 --> 00:31:12,447
You don't know a fucking thing!

444
00:31:12,614 --> 00:31:13,698
What do you know?

445
00:31:13,865 --> 00:31:15,700
Cut it out, asshole.

446
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:18,036
- Watch your tongue! - If you watch yours!

447
00:31:19,162 --> 00:31:21,956
The bastards who beat up Abdel will go to jail!

448
00:31:22,123 --> 00:31:24,083
You're dreaming.

449
00:31:24,334 --> 00:31:26,127
The cops at the hospital

450
00:31:26,294 --> 00:31:28,296
protect Abdel and his family.

451
00:31:28,922 --> 00:31:31,758
You just fuck things up!

452
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,386
You idiot, you got it all wrong.

453
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:39,140
Those cops are just protecting Abdel!

454
00:31:39,849 --> 00:31:43,561
Most cops don't beat on you. They protect you!

455
00:31:45,063 --> 00:31:47,232
Who protects us from you?

456
00:33:05,435 --> 00:33:07,061
Never do it again!

457
00:33:07,228 --> 00:33:08,813
Who writes your jokes?

458
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,024
Watch your tongue!

459
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:13,026
Watch your mother!

460
00:33:15,904 --> 00:33:17,822
You ever trash me again,

461
00:33:17,989 --> 00:33:20,033
you go to central lock-up.

462
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,994
Your brother can bail you out.

463
00:33:23,161 --> 00:33:25,788
- I didn't ask no favors. - I did it for your brother.

464
00:33:25,955 --> 00:33:28,291
He'd rip you apart!

465
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:31,377
You're the ripper.

466
00:33:37,091 --> 00:33:40,803
About the boxing gym: I can get you a City grant.

467
00:33:41,054 --> 00:33:43,306
You'll get another gym.

468
00:33:44,307 --> 00:33:47,894
Kids want to punch more than bags now!

469
00:33:48,061 --> 00:33:52,106
It's hopeless. Once I could talk to the kids. No more.

470
00:33:52,273 --> 00:33:57,237
And they know me! A rookie cop wouldn't last a month.

471
00:33:57,403 --> 00:34:00,031
An Arab in a police station doesn't last an hour!

472
00:34:01,658 --> 00:34:04,744
I have to go. Try to keep cool.

473
00:34:04,994 --> 00:34:07,539
Yeah, we'll try.

474
00:34:07,705 --> 00:34:10,333
Outta my face, you fucker!

475
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,001
OK!

476
00:34:14,462 --> 00:34:15,463
You shook his hand?

477
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,840
He's always been cool with me.

478
00:34:18,007 --> 00:34:20,134
You don't shake a pig's hand!

479
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:25,056
You shoot him, I shake his hand! You're a fucking pain!

480
00:34:25,223 --> 00:34:27,308
And you're out of it! Look!

481
00:34:27,475 --> 00:34:29,686
I knew it!

482
00:34:29,853 --> 00:34:31,688
You acted so weird at the hospital.

483
00:34:31,855 --> 00:34:33,773
- Take it easy. - Let me see.

484
00:34:35,692 --> 00:34:36,734
You didn't tell us?

485
00:34:37,569 --> 00:34:39,070
You didn't want to know!

486
00:34:39,237 --> 00:34:41,155
Packing that! You retard!

487
00:34:41,322 --> 00:34:44,033
I'm a big boy. Quit preaching!

488
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,160
I'll bust your chops!

489
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:48,663
Stop it!

490
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,542
You feel big with that gun! I'll kick your ass!

491
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:53,793
Like how?

492
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,796
Cut it out. Let's grab a sandwich.

493
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,132
You shut up!

494
00:34:59,674 --> 00:35:00,675
I'm splitting.

495
00:35:00,842 --> 00:35:02,594
So split!

496
00:35:03,636 --> 00:35:05,305
Stay with us.

497
00:35:05,555 --> 00:35:07,140
Sayid, let him split!

498
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:10,602
Don't go!

499
00:35:10,768 --> 00:35:12,061
Back off.

500
00:35:16,024 --> 00:35:18,151
What's with him?

501
00:35:20,862 --> 00:35:23,156
Jerk thinks too much.

502
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,341
- Where's Mom? - Explain this to me.

503
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:43,468
I can't now.

504
00:35:51,392 --> 00:35:52,727
Well?

505
00:35:53,895 --> 00:35:55,021
What's the answer?

506
00:35:55,188 --> 00:35:56,105
I don't know.

507
00:35:56,272 --> 00:35:58,858
- You never know. - OK, I never know.

508
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:00,610
Hi, Mom.

509
00:36:00,902 --> 00:36:02,278
How's the kid brother?

510
00:36:02,445 --> 00:36:03,821
He's fine.

511
00:36:04,072 --> 00:36:07,450
But your brother in jail isn't so good.

512
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,202
What's with Max?

513
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:11,579
He needs textbooks.

514
00:36:11,746 --> 00:36:13,206
What for?

515
00:36:13,373 --> 00:36:17,210
To get a high school diploma while he's inside.

516
00:36:19,337 --> 00:36:22,173
He never made grade school!

517
00:36:23,466 --> 00:36:25,677
Hands off the pots!

518
00:36:26,553 --> 00:36:27,845
I didn't do nothing!

519
00:36:28,054 --> 00:36:30,515
I don't know how I'll buy his books.

520
00:36:30,682 --> 00:36:31,891
By the way...

521
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:35,311
There's the money for the power bill.

522
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:43,444
- And my machine? - What machine?

523
00:36:43,611 --> 00:36:47,073
My new sewing machine!

524
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,951
Shit, I forgot to ask WalMart.

525
00:36:50,118 --> 00:36:52,829
Mine's ready to croak.

526
00:36:52,996 --> 00:36:55,331
Patou, go study in your room.

527
00:36:55,498 --> 00:36:58,167
- Mom. - Don't argue.

528
00:36:59,294 --> 00:37:01,754
Who's WalMart? That fence in Tower B?

529
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:04,007
No, he's in Tower D.

530
00:37:04,173 --> 00:37:05,800
I don't know him.

531
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,969
Could he get us textbooks?

532
00:37:08,136 --> 00:37:09,888
That's not his line, Mom.

533
00:37:10,054 --> 00:37:11,723
Officials now admit

534
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:15,685
that a policeman lost his gun in the riot last night.

535
00:37:15,852 --> 00:37:17,937
It is still missing.

536
00:37:18,104 --> 00:37:22,192
We asked locals if a loose gun is dangerous

537
00:37:22,358 --> 00:37:24,569
in this explosive situation...

538
00:37:24,944 --> 00:37:25,987
What a fuck up!

539
00:37:26,154 --> 00:37:28,156
They burned down the gym.

540
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:34,913
I'm sick of the projects. I want out. It's getting worse.

541
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:38,166
I'm sure Vinz helped torch the gym.

542
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:41,836
He's going wild, like Max.

543
00:37:43,379 --> 00:37:45,006
I have to get out.

544
00:37:46,174 --> 00:37:47,675
I have to leave this place.

545
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:51,471
If you see a grocery, buy me a lettuce.

546
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:52,889
No credit for you.

547
00:37:53,056 --> 00:37:56,643
My Granma's a regular here! So I'm 2 bits short!

548
00:37:57,268 --> 00:38:00,188
You're not your Granma.

549
00:38:01,022 --> 00:38:02,649
- Hands off! - Just looking!

550
00:38:02,815 --> 00:38:05,151
- Got two bits? - How about one?

551
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:07,487
- One OK? - One not OK.

552
00:38:08,613 --> 00:38:11,658
Gimme a coin, you dinosaur!

553
00:38:11,824 --> 00:38:13,409
No coins for you.

554
00:38:13,576 --> 00:38:15,620
OK... Now what?

555
00:38:15,787 --> 00:38:17,830
So what'll it be?

556
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,792
- I saw you! - You saw what?

557
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:23,670
Gimme the red peppers. They're cheaper.

558
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,006
My granma'll kill me! She hates 'em.

559
00:38:29,425 --> 00:38:31,761
So shoot the Chink, grab the green peppers!

560
00:38:31,928 --> 00:38:33,888
It'll make Granma's day!

561
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:07,166
Fuck, fuck the po-lice...

562
00:41:56,049 --> 00:41:57,592
He's intense.

563
00:41:58,259 --> 00:41:59,427
Killer!

564
00:42:00,553 --> 00:42:02,180
A mother killer!

565
00:42:10,146 --> 00:42:13,066
Sayid, check out the cow.

566
00:42:13,233 --> 00:42:15,360
Fuck off with your cow!

567
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,363
- I swear! - You said you'd cut my hair.

568
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,573
The same cow! I saw it!

569
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,075
You're the cow!

570
00:42:22,242 --> 00:42:24,827
It was the same fucking cow!

571
00:42:24,994 --> 00:42:26,663
You got to believe me!

572
00:42:26,829 --> 00:42:27,997
Shut up!

573
00:42:32,126 --> 00:42:35,421
I'm Señor Duck...

574
00:42:39,551 --> 00:42:42,637
I fuck you, I fuck her, I fuck him...

575
00:42:42,804 --> 00:42:46,224
OK Granma! So they're red peppers!

576
00:42:47,183 --> 00:42:49,769
You know this cow business.

577
00:42:49,936 --> 00:42:51,688
It's a weird trip.

578
00:42:51,855 --> 00:42:55,441
Don't wreck my hair!

579
00:42:55,608 --> 00:42:58,236
I got to get laid! So watch it!

580
00:42:58,403 --> 00:43:00,321
I can mow a lawn, I'll try.

581
00:43:00,488 --> 00:43:01,155
A lawn?

582
00:43:01,322 --> 00:43:03,366
Sit your ass down.

583
00:43:04,325 --> 00:43:06,202
- It's hot, Vinz - What?

584
00:43:06,369 --> 00:43:08,204
A cop's piece is hot.

585
00:43:08,371 --> 00:43:11,916
You said that already. Sit still, loser!

586
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:14,085
I'll whack you.

587
00:43:14,377 --> 00:43:16,087
Don't move.

588
00:43:16,504 --> 00:43:18,423
If Abdel dies, you'll kill?

589
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,968
Want to be the next Arab iced by the pigs?

590
00:43:22,135 --> 00:43:24,137
Well, me neither.

591
00:43:24,304 --> 00:43:26,306
So now you're an Arab!

592
00:43:26,472 --> 00:43:28,600
They think we're full of shit.

593
00:43:28,766 --> 00:43:31,895
But I'm not bullshitting about this, Sayid.

594
00:43:33,771 --> 00:43:35,064
Watch it!

595
00:43:35,231 --> 00:43:36,691
It's cool.

596
00:43:36,858 --> 00:43:39,944
Is this gun legit for a cop? ...What'd you do?

597
00:43:40,111 --> 00:43:41,988
Nothing, I swear it!

598
00:43:42,155 --> 00:43:44,532
Why swear?

599
00:43:44,699 --> 00:43:45,950
Because it's nothing.

600
00:43:46,117 --> 00:43:47,410
I'm cold there!

601
00:43:47,577 --> 00:43:50,038
It's cold in this room!

602
00:43:52,332 --> 00:43:55,543
I'll even it out, it'll be great!

603
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:58,213
I got a date! Lemme see!

604
00:43:58,379 --> 00:44:00,131
No fucking trust!

605
00:44:00,965 --> 00:44:02,008
I didn't see!

606
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,426
You didn't look!

607
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,429
Trust me, dammit!

608
00:44:07,305 --> 00:44:08,806
It's a nice hole.

609
00:44:08,973 --> 00:44:10,391
A nice what?

610
00:44:10,558 --> 00:44:13,561
Trust me, or no haircut!

611
00:44:16,814 --> 00:44:18,274
Look at me, Sayid!

612
00:44:18,441 --> 00:44:20,109
Get outta here!

613
00:44:20,276 --> 00:44:21,986
Don't get bummed out!

614
00:44:23,571 --> 00:44:25,740
It's the style in New York.

615
00:44:25,907 --> 00:44:28,785
The killer cut, so stop whining!

616
00:44:28,952 --> 00:44:29,869
New York?

617
00:44:30,036 --> 00:44:33,706
They got hair like this in New York? I look punk!

618
00:44:33,873 --> 00:44:34,707
Honest!

619
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:35,959
Don't laugh!

620
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:38,586
Give us a kiss, Sayid.

621
00:44:38,753 --> 00:44:40,421
Outta my face!

622
00:44:40,588 --> 00:44:43,466
No hard feelings, sucker!

623
00:44:46,594 --> 00:44:49,180
Hey pooch, your master's an asshole!

624
00:44:56,479 --> 00:44:58,022
There's your sister.

625
00:45:04,153 --> 00:45:06,489
- Why are you here? - And you?

626
00:45:06,656 --> 00:45:08,783
I'm asking the questions!

627
00:45:08,992 --> 00:45:11,369
You should be in school.

628
00:45:11,578 --> 00:45:13,955
Get outta here!

629
00:45:15,373 --> 00:45:17,584
Get lost, you cows.

630
00:45:18,835 --> 00:45:20,253
You still here?

631
00:45:22,922 --> 00:45:24,257
Get lost!

632
00:45:24,716 --> 00:45:26,342
You talk to my friends!

633
00:45:26,509 --> 00:45:28,052
To Vincent.

634
00:45:28,219 --> 00:45:32,098
The name's Vinz, not Vincent! And don't talk to him!

635
00:45:32,265 --> 00:45:35,268
- Get a move on! - Don't push!

636
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,691
- Coming tonight? - Where?

637
00:45:41,858 --> 00:45:44,819
Jason's brother's in a prize fight.

638
00:45:44,986 --> 00:45:47,280
- Got tickets? - Freebies.

639
00:45:47,447 --> 00:45:48,865
Killer!

640
00:45:50,658 --> 00:45:52,368
Who cut your hair, Sayid?

641
00:45:53,786 --> 00:45:55,788
Kids these days!

642
00:45:56,331 --> 00:45:57,123
Check that!

643
00:47:02,272 --> 00:47:03,940
Shit's happening!

644
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,745
Abdel's my brother, pig!

645
00:47:20,164 --> 00:47:21,749
You're going to pay!

646
00:47:23,501 --> 00:47:24,460
Step on it!

647
00:47:25,086 --> 00:47:26,296
It's stalled!

648
00:47:26,504 --> 00:47:28,423
Outta the car, freeze!

649
00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:41,644
Drop the gun!

650
00:47:46,024 --> 00:47:47,567
Freeze!

651
00:48:08,796 --> 00:48:09,797
Get back!

652
00:48:10,882 --> 00:48:12,300
Get the fuck out!

653
00:48:12,467 --> 00:48:14,677
Riot cops are coming!

654
00:48:14,928 --> 00:48:16,930
Get back, scum!

655
00:48:28,233 --> 00:48:30,109
Vinz, Hubert, this way!

656
00:48:33,947 --> 00:48:35,323
This way!

657
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,868
Freeze!

658
00:48:42,247 --> 00:48:44,249
You crazy?

659
00:48:47,794 --> 00:48:49,003
Where were you?

660
00:48:49,587 --> 00:48:51,631
We fucked your mother!

661
00:48:57,387 --> 00:49:00,974
I swear the pig was right in my sights.

662
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,143
I had him like I have you now!

663
00:49:05,603 --> 00:49:08,231
The sucker froze, shit his pants.

664
00:49:08,398 --> 00:49:10,650
Without Hubert, I'd have smoked him!

665
00:49:10,817 --> 00:49:12,735
Right in the mother!

666
00:49:12,902 --> 00:49:16,281
Hubert slugged him so hard he went into orbit!

667
00:49:16,447 --> 00:49:17,156
No!

668
00:49:17,323 --> 00:49:18,575
I swear it!

669
00:49:18,741 --> 00:49:20,118
Slugged a pig?

670
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,079
You were great!

671
00:49:33,882 --> 00:49:37,010
THE WORLD IS YOURS

672
00:50:15,256 --> 00:50:17,175
Now what do we do?

673
00:50:20,637 --> 00:50:23,932
I got to call to get my bucks.

674
00:50:30,522 --> 00:50:32,482
Got Snoopy's address?

675
00:50:33,149 --> 00:50:35,693
I'll wait, but not forever!

676
00:50:38,071 --> 00:50:42,450
This cost me a $3 chocolate milk! I'd better collect!

677
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:45,620
You want some, Vinz?

678
00:50:46,037 --> 00:50:47,038
- Want some? - No.

679
00:50:47,205 --> 00:50:48,331
You sure?

680
00:50:49,958 --> 00:50:52,001
Want some, Cousin Hubie?

681
00:50:52,752 --> 00:50:54,671
You're already chocolate!

682
00:51:00,301 --> 00:51:02,929
Will you guys stop sulking?

683
00:51:04,264 --> 00:51:07,600
Who's sulking? Not me!

684
00:51:07,767 --> 00:51:09,477
- Unbelievable! - Ask him!

685
00:51:09,644 --> 00:51:11,229
A couple of kids!

686
00:51:11,396 --> 00:51:15,400
- Who's the kid? - 2 kids worrying over jackshit!

687
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:18,069
I'm 100% behind you!

688
00:51:18,778 --> 00:51:21,155
Wanting to kill a cop is jackshit!

689
00:51:22,323 --> 00:51:26,452
Tell your buddy to back off! I never said I wanted to.

690
00:51:26,786 --> 00:51:27,495
Yes, you did!

691
00:51:27,662 --> 00:51:28,454
- Yes! - No!

692
00:51:28,621 --> 00:51:30,456
I didn't say that!

693
00:51:30,623 --> 00:51:32,667
I said if Abdel died,

694
00:51:32,834 --> 00:51:35,587
I'd smoke a cop. Not for the hell of it!

695
00:51:36,004 --> 00:51:38,006
Without my gun back there,

696
00:51:38,172 --> 00:51:40,008
we'd have been history!

697
00:51:40,174 --> 00:51:42,385
My name's not Rodney King!

698
00:51:42,552 --> 00:51:44,304
Not the same thing!

699
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:47,807
Expect us to bring you gifts in jail?

700
00:51:48,516 --> 00:51:52,604
I expect nothing! Not from a guy who kisses cop ass!

701
00:51:54,105 --> 00:51:55,773
Go ahead, laugh!

702
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,775
Laugh!

703
00:51:57,942 --> 00:52:01,070
I'm fucking sick of the goddam system!

704
00:52:01,237 --> 00:52:05,116
We live in rat holes, you do fuck-all to change things!

705
00:52:05,283 --> 00:52:07,368
Neither do you!

706
00:52:07,577 --> 00:52:09,996
You're my homeys, so I'll tell you:

707
00:52:10,163 --> 00:52:12,081
If Abdel dies, I hit back.

708
00:52:12,248 --> 00:52:14,125
I'll whack a pig!

709
00:52:16,419 --> 00:52:19,714
So they know we don't turn the other cheek now!

710
00:52:20,215 --> 00:52:22,008
Wow, what a speech!

711
00:52:22,175 --> 00:52:25,011
Half Moses, half Mickey Mouse.

712
00:52:25,178 --> 00:52:28,806
Forget it, Vinz. You're out of your league.

713
00:52:28,973 --> 00:52:31,643
If Abdel dies, we lose a friend?

714
00:52:31,809 --> 00:52:32,560
Right!

715
00:52:32,727 --> 00:52:35,396
If a cop dies, do all cops go away?

716
00:52:35,563 --> 00:52:39,526
You're just one guy! You can't blow 'em all away!

717
00:52:39,692 --> 00:52:41,778
Who made you a preacher?

718
00:52:41,945 --> 00:52:44,614
You know what's right and wrong?

719
00:52:44,781 --> 00:52:47,659
Why do you side with the assholes?

720
00:52:47,825 --> 00:52:49,953
Who's the asshole?

721
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:54,624
In school we learnt that hate breeds hate!

722
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:57,919
I didn't go to school, I'm from the street!

723
00:52:58,086 --> 00:52:59,712
Know what it taught me?

724
00:52:59,879 --> 00:53:03,550
Turn the other cheek, you're dead mothafucka!

725
00:53:04,175 --> 00:53:09,305
Bullshit! You pointed a gun at a cop! We could have been killed!

726
00:53:09,472 --> 00:53:11,474
Nothing like a good shit!

727
00:53:12,642 --> 00:53:16,813
You believe in God? That's the wrong question.

728
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,274
Does God believe in us?

729
00:53:19,482 --> 00:53:23,111
I once had a friend called Grunwalski.

730
00:53:23,278 --> 00:53:26,489
We were sent to Siberia together.

731
00:53:26,865 --> 00:53:30,368
When you go to a Siberian work camp,

732
00:53:30,535 --> 00:53:33,413
you travel in a cattle car.

733
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:37,667
You roll across icy steppes for days,

734
00:53:37,834 --> 00:53:40,128
without seeing a soul.

735
00:53:40,295 --> 00:53:42,672
You huddle to keep warm.

736
00:53:42,964 --> 00:53:47,635
But it's hard to relieve yourself, to take a shit,

737
00:53:47,802 --> 00:53:50,221
you can't do it on the train,

738
00:53:50,388 --> 00:53:53,308
and the only time the train stops

739
00:53:53,474 --> 00:53:57,145
is to take on water for the locomotive.

740
00:53:57,312 --> 00:54:00,356
But Grunwalski was shy.

741
00:54:00,523 --> 00:54:02,817
Even when we bathed together,

742
00:54:03,484 --> 00:54:04,652
he got upset.

743
00:54:04,819 --> 00:54:08,281
I used to kid him about it.

744
00:54:08,698 --> 00:54:13,536
So, the train stops and everyone jumps out to shit

745
00:54:13,703 --> 00:54:15,622
on the tracks.

746
00:54:15,788 --> 00:54:19,167
I'd teased Grunwalski so much

747
00:54:19,334 --> 00:54:22,545
that he went off on his own.

748
00:54:22,795 --> 00:54:25,590
The train starts moving,

749
00:54:25,757 --> 00:54:28,009
so everyone jumps on,

750
00:54:28,218 --> 00:54:30,845
because it waits for nobody.

751
00:54:31,346 --> 00:54:33,681
Grunwalski had a problem:

752
00:54:33,848 --> 00:54:36,893
He'd gone behind a bush

753
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,020
and was still shitting.

754
00:54:39,479 --> 00:54:43,691
So I see him come out from behind the bush,

755
00:54:43,858 --> 00:54:46,277
holding up his pants

756
00:54:46,528 --> 00:54:48,488
with his hands.

757
00:54:48,696 --> 00:54:51,324
He tries to catch up.

758
00:54:51,824 --> 00:54:53,701
I hold out my hand,

759
00:54:53,868 --> 00:54:56,704
but each time he reaches for it

760
00:54:56,871 --> 00:54:58,623
he lets go of his pants

761
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:01,084
and they drop to his ankles.

762
00:55:01,459 --> 00:55:03,211
He pulls them back up,

763
00:55:03,378 --> 00:55:05,129
starts running again,

764
00:55:05,296 --> 00:55:08,758
but they fall back down,

765
00:55:08,925 --> 00:55:11,386
when he reaches out for me.

766
00:55:12,929 --> 00:55:15,098
- Then what happened? - Nothing.

767
00:55:15,598 --> 00:55:16,975
Grunwalski...

768
00:55:18,142 --> 00:55:19,978
froze to death.

769
00:55:22,063 --> 00:55:22,981
Good day.

770
00:55:29,946 --> 00:55:31,698
Why'd he tell us that?

771
00:55:40,081 --> 00:55:42,458
I got the address. I'll call you.

772
00:55:46,087 --> 00:55:47,839
Why'd he tell us that?

773
00:56:03,897 --> 00:56:06,191
'Scuse me, I'm just out of the hospital.

774
00:56:06,357 --> 00:56:08,443
I haven't eaten for 2 days.

775
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:12,447
My child's hungry, I need your spare change...

776
00:56:14,574 --> 00:56:17,285
I want to date with Mina!

777
00:56:17,452 --> 00:56:19,370
I'll lasso her!

778
00:56:20,496 --> 00:56:23,124
What do you want? My dad's in jail,

779
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:25,835
my mom's in jail, my whole family is!

780
00:56:26,002 --> 00:56:28,087
Get a job like everyone else!

781
00:56:28,296 --> 00:56:30,924
What is this, Mardi Gras?

782
00:56:33,927 --> 00:56:35,762
I want Mina!

783
00:56:38,139 --> 00:56:42,685
I'm homeless, my welfare ran out.

784
00:56:42,936 --> 00:56:46,940
I got out of a halfway house...

785
00:56:47,106 --> 00:56:49,609
It's a block away.

786
00:56:49,943 --> 00:56:50,527
Thanks.

787
00:56:50,693 --> 00:56:52,153
Have a nice day, sir.

788
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,404
Thanks.

789
00:56:57,909 --> 00:57:00,370
The pigs are fucking polite around here!

790
00:57:01,704 --> 00:57:03,748
Even called me sir!

791
00:57:15,009 --> 00:57:17,470
Maybe he won the lottery!

792
00:57:22,225 --> 00:57:24,519
Damn, it's locked!

793
00:57:25,728 --> 00:57:27,897
What's his real name?

794
00:57:28,064 --> 00:57:30,859
I only know him as Snoopy.

795
00:57:38,032 --> 00:57:40,910
- Yes? - Sorry to bother you.

796
00:57:41,077 --> 00:57:42,745
I'm looking for...

797
00:57:42,996 --> 00:57:44,163
Snoopy.

798
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:47,000
- It sounds weird. - Very funny!

799
00:57:49,127 --> 00:57:51,129
The fucker hung up.

800
00:57:51,963 --> 00:57:53,214
You try.

801
00:57:53,381 --> 00:57:55,425
- Why me? - Try!

802
00:57:56,009 --> 00:57:58,011
Darkie and me will get shot at!

803
00:58:00,763 --> 00:58:02,265
- Hello. - Yes?

804
00:58:02,432 --> 00:58:04,309
Is Snoopy there?

805
00:58:05,143 --> 00:58:07,228
No, but Charlie Brown is!

806
00:58:11,316 --> 00:58:14,068
You fucked it up, you asshole!

807
00:58:14,235 --> 00:58:15,361
Stop that!

808
00:58:15,528 --> 00:58:17,322
Sorry to bother you.

809
00:58:17,488 --> 00:58:21,826
Our pal Snoopy lives here, we don't know his real name.

810
00:58:21,993 --> 00:58:25,371
Stop ringing! You think the world is yours?

811
00:58:25,538 --> 00:58:27,457
Unreal!

812
00:58:31,127 --> 00:58:33,087
No, we're staying!

813
00:58:36,758 --> 00:58:38,760
So call the cops, you spic!

814
00:58:38,927 --> 00:58:39,677
Sayid?

815
00:58:40,803 --> 00:58:42,138
Snoopy?

816
00:58:42,847 --> 00:58:44,974
- What floor? - 5th.

817
00:58:45,225 --> 00:58:46,351
We're coming!

818
00:58:48,853 --> 00:58:50,688
Snoopy? Is no name!

819
00:58:50,855 --> 00:58:52,690
You always make-a trouble!

820
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:07,914
- Were you followed? - No.

821
00:59:08,081 --> 00:59:09,791
- No one? - Nobody!

822
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:11,251
- You sure? - Why?

823
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:12,669
Because...

824
00:59:16,548 --> 00:59:17,131
You cool?

825
00:59:17,298 --> 00:59:18,675
Great!

826
00:59:18,841 --> 00:59:20,343
Check that kitchen.

827
00:59:20,802 --> 00:59:22,303
Who's this dude?

828
00:59:24,222 --> 00:59:26,975
Nice space! You win the lottery?

829
00:59:27,141 --> 00:59:30,812
A guy loaned it to me. He is not getting it back!

830
00:59:30,979 --> 00:59:34,148
This is no apartment, it's a palace!

831
00:59:34,482 --> 00:59:35,525
I don't believe it.

832
00:59:35,692 --> 00:59:38,069
Bitching apartment!

833
00:59:38,236 --> 00:59:41,155
Snoopy, meet Vinz.

834
00:59:43,449 --> 00:59:45,285
This is Cousin Hubert!

835
00:59:45,827 --> 00:59:47,245
We've met before!

836
00:59:48,037 --> 00:59:49,747
- Line of coke? - No.

837
00:59:49,914 --> 00:59:51,499
- You sure? - No thanks.

838
00:59:51,666 --> 00:59:54,419
A little line of coke?

839
00:59:54,586 --> 00:59:57,213
No one for coke?

840
00:59:57,589 --> 00:59:59,632
- How's your bro? - OK.

841
00:59:59,799 --> 01:00:01,551
Mean fucking dude!

842
01:00:01,718 --> 01:00:04,012
- He still a maniac? - And you?

843
01:00:04,179 --> 01:00:06,181
Fucking A! Watch!

844
01:00:06,973 --> 01:00:08,391
So you got my cash?

845
01:00:08,766 --> 01:00:09,976
My bread!

846
01:00:10,143 --> 01:00:13,521
Make it snappy, Snoopy!

847
01:00:13,688 --> 01:00:15,815
Cut the bullshit!

848
01:00:19,152 --> 01:00:20,361
Come get it.

849
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:23,239
Coming at you, Bruce Lee!

850
01:00:29,412 --> 01:00:31,289
- Hands off! - What?

851
01:00:31,456 --> 01:00:33,917
Not for kids! It's my gun!

852
01:00:35,877 --> 01:00:38,713
So what? I got a piece too.

853
01:00:40,673 --> 01:00:41,758
Let's see!

854
01:00:42,634 --> 01:00:44,010
Whip it out.

855
01:00:48,056 --> 01:00:48,973
Fuck!

856
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,475
Don't, Vinz!

857
01:00:50,683 --> 01:00:51,809
He knows guns.

858
01:00:51,976 --> 01:00:55,313
A snub-nosed Smith & Wesson Magnum 44.

859
01:00:56,105 --> 01:00:57,232
Watch it!

860
01:00:57,398 --> 01:00:58,483
It's loaded.

861
01:00:59,567 --> 01:01:00,735
Mean piece.

862
01:01:01,653 --> 01:01:03,196
You're a gangster.

863
01:01:04,405 --> 01:01:06,115
It's for self-defense.

864
01:01:06,282 --> 01:01:08,284
You into magic?

865
01:01:08,451 --> 01:01:09,410
Watch.

866
01:01:09,744 --> 01:01:10,954
One bullet.

867
01:01:15,083 --> 01:01:16,251
I missed.

868
01:01:16,793 --> 01:01:18,002
You're nuts!

869
01:01:18,169 --> 01:01:21,172
- That's live ammo! - It's an old trick!

870
01:01:21,923 --> 01:01:23,049
Cool it.

871
01:01:23,216 --> 01:01:26,594
We up the stakes: 2 bullets!

872
01:01:27,595 --> 01:01:28,763
Snoopy!

873
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:31,641
Wigging out, guys?

874
01:01:32,225 --> 01:01:33,977
You're nuts.

875
01:01:34,143 --> 01:01:35,270
Gimme!

876
01:01:37,146 --> 01:01:38,314
Your turn.

877
01:01:38,481 --> 01:01:40,400
Let's go, he's fried.

878
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:41,526
Going to do it?

879
01:01:42,068 --> 01:01:44,279
- Gimme. - Do it!

880
01:01:45,905 --> 01:01:47,407
I did it, you do it!

881
01:01:47,574 --> 01:01:49,450
Man, you want trouble?

882
01:01:49,617 --> 01:01:51,327
Do it!

883
01:01:52,245 --> 01:01:53,538
Chill, guys!

884
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:57,208
Stop, Vinz!

885
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,710
You aiming at me?

886
01:01:58,877 --> 01:02:00,712
You're off your head!

887
01:02:01,087 --> 01:02:02,755
You bet I'm aiming at you!

888
01:02:02,922 --> 01:02:05,049
No one fucks with me!

889
01:02:05,967 --> 01:02:08,428
I'm not some ass-wipe!

890
01:02:09,762 --> 01:02:11,181
Want to see a gun?

891
01:02:11,347 --> 01:02:12,974
A fucking gun?

892
01:02:16,728 --> 01:02:18,771
Sayid, get him out!

893
01:02:20,523 --> 01:02:22,233
We're outta here!

894
01:02:25,361 --> 01:02:28,156
Up your mother's slash, sucker!

895
01:02:29,324 --> 01:02:30,325
Look!

896
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:37,540
That's right, asshole!

897
01:02:38,041 --> 01:02:39,167
He was bluffing!

898
01:02:39,334 --> 01:02:43,588
Now I'll never get my cash!

899
01:02:43,755 --> 01:02:46,883
Leave us out of your games, Vinz!

900
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:51,804
Games? We got a pal in the hospital!

901
01:02:51,971 --> 01:02:53,973
Don't take on the world!

902
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:56,309
You got the wrong build!

903
01:02:56,476 --> 01:03:00,355
I'm not like you, Mr. Black Hercules, right?

904
01:03:00,522 --> 01:03:01,814
Go fuck yourself!

905
01:03:02,148 --> 01:03:03,316
Fuck myself?

906
01:03:10,907 --> 01:03:12,659
Alright, kids!

907
01:03:12,825 --> 01:03:14,369
- Who're you? - Easy!

908
01:03:14,536 --> 01:03:16,704
You had your fun!

909
01:03:16,871 --> 01:03:18,331
Easy!

910
01:03:21,543 --> 01:03:23,169
Search them.

911
01:03:23,336 --> 01:03:26,130
Fast work! In my 'hood, the cops come

912
01:03:26,297 --> 01:03:28,508
a week after you're dead!

913
01:03:28,758 --> 01:03:30,218
Hey, you!

914
01:03:31,344 --> 01:03:34,305
- You together? - I don't know them.

915
01:03:34,472 --> 01:03:35,932
Why you here?

916
01:03:36,099 --> 01:03:38,059
I live with my aunt!

917
01:03:38,226 --> 01:03:39,435
What's her name?

918
01:03:39,602 --> 01:03:41,354
Mrs. Zyl...

919
01:03:42,856 --> 01:03:46,985
- Got I.D.? - I'm on the level...

920
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,411
Easy!

921
01:03:56,578 --> 01:03:58,580
Freeze!

922
01:03:58,788 --> 01:04:00,331
Don't move, boy!

923
01:04:01,207 --> 01:04:02,208
You know him?

924
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:03,835
- Who? - Your pal.

925
01:04:04,002 --> 01:04:05,587
I don't know him.

926
01:04:06,796 --> 01:04:09,340
We'll see about that, wise guy!

927
01:04:10,383 --> 01:04:12,468
- This is humiliating! - Too bad.

928
01:04:14,262 --> 01:04:15,805
What's this?

929
01:04:16,389 --> 01:04:17,724
Good stuff!

930
01:04:18,057 --> 01:04:20,560
I'm keeping it.

931
01:04:22,395 --> 01:04:24,689
Afghan's the best.

932
01:04:25,148 --> 01:04:27,192
Good buzz going up and down.

933
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:29,944
Same with Black Bombay.

934
01:04:30,153 --> 01:04:32,322
Lebanese can really vary.

935
01:04:32,488 --> 01:04:36,451
This is crap but I'll keep it... Well?

936
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:40,079
The little fucker outran me. Take them in.

937
01:04:40,246 --> 01:04:41,789
- Get in the back. - Why me?

938
01:04:41,956 --> 01:04:43,333
Get in!

939
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:59,265
Listen, scumbag. You know what I think of you?

940
01:04:59,474 --> 01:05:01,476
You're like poodle shit on a sidewalk.

941
01:05:01,643 --> 01:05:03,937
I can't take a step

942
01:05:04,103 --> 01:05:08,483
without squashing your ugly dog-turd face.

943
01:05:09,025 --> 01:05:12,111
So watch where the dog dumps you!

944
01:06:08,376 --> 01:06:09,711
You're all alone!

945
01:06:10,336 --> 01:06:12,088
Far from the slums...

946
01:06:12,672 --> 01:06:14,090
and your looter pals.

947
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:17,510
Pick it up with your feet.

948
01:06:18,178 --> 01:06:20,221
Like your people do back home.

949
01:06:21,514 --> 01:06:23,808
They're great with their feet.

950
01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:27,437
This is the hard part.

951
01:06:31,482 --> 01:06:34,819
OK, there's no big hurry.

952
01:06:34,986 --> 01:06:37,197
In 2 hours, they may be free.

953
01:06:37,363 --> 01:06:39,199
Make the most of it.

954
01:06:41,701 --> 01:06:45,455
How 'bout a bullet in the back of your head?

955
01:06:45,955 --> 01:06:47,790
A nice little bullet?

956
01:06:47,957 --> 01:06:50,335
You got to stop in time.

957
01:06:50,501 --> 01:06:52,879
You need self-control.

958
01:06:53,046 --> 01:06:54,672
Got to be a pro.

959
01:06:54,839 --> 01:06:57,509
This takes control.

960
01:06:59,177 --> 01:07:01,221
Don't get mad! It won't last!

961
01:07:04,432 --> 01:07:07,268
You got something to say?

962
01:07:07,894 --> 01:07:11,105
Don't touch him!

963
01:07:11,523 --> 01:07:13,942
You know this one?

964
01:07:14,108 --> 01:07:15,985
The Shanghai Squeeze.

965
01:07:16,194 --> 01:07:18,238
It's an oldie.

966
01:07:20,198 --> 01:07:23,034
Wait, I think he's thirsty.

967
01:07:24,827 --> 01:07:26,204
Fucker!

968
01:07:26,371 --> 01:07:28,540
Don't hurt yourself!

969
01:07:28,706 --> 01:07:31,042
Take it easy!

970
01:07:32,168 --> 01:07:34,212
Don't get me aroused.

971
01:07:34,546 --> 01:07:36,673
You look like a bitch from behind!

972
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:40,385
A nice bitch to suck me off!

973
01:07:42,095 --> 01:07:43,555
Blow jobs!

974
01:07:43,847 --> 01:07:45,682
Bitches to suck my dick!

975
01:07:46,266 --> 01:07:49,102
That's the way. Then you relax!

976
01:07:49,435 --> 01:07:52,105
But it's hard to stop in time.

977
01:07:52,272 --> 01:07:54,440
You got to stay in control.

978
01:07:58,570 --> 01:07:59,779
That's the trick.

979
01:07:59,946 --> 01:08:01,406
I like his face.

980
01:08:01,573 --> 01:08:02,615
He's cute.

981
01:08:03,157 --> 01:08:05,034
What was the name?

982
01:08:06,786 --> 01:08:10,415
- Are you cute? - Yes! I'm cute!

983
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:13,459
I'm cute!

984
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:17,088
- Which one? - He's Hubert.

985
01:08:17,255 --> 01:08:18,715
That's no Hubert!

986
01:08:18,882 --> 01:08:20,758
He's French, he's Sayid.

987
01:08:20,925 --> 01:08:22,802
Sayid? That's pretty!

988
01:08:22,969 --> 01:08:26,055
Is Sayid a French name?

989
01:08:26,222 --> 01:08:28,600
Aren't they pretty?

990
01:08:29,392 --> 01:08:31,895
Take a good look!

991
01:08:33,938 --> 01:08:36,024
The little guy's excited.

992
01:08:36,191 --> 01:08:39,235
Leave him alone!

993
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:48,995
It's so easy to go too far!

994
01:08:49,162 --> 01:08:52,248
But you mustn't! Though you're dying to!

995
01:08:52,957 --> 01:08:55,752
Right, you Arab son of a bitch?

996
01:08:58,588 --> 01:09:00,256
OK, let's go.

997
01:09:22,403 --> 01:09:24,197
Sir!

998
01:09:24,364 --> 01:09:26,241
We'll miss the last train!

999
01:09:26,407 --> 01:09:27,700
Forget it.

1000
01:09:27,867 --> 01:09:28,993
Bastard!

1001
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:31,871
Did I talk to you?

1002
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:05,154
Yo, Vinz!

1003
01:10:06,698 --> 01:10:08,366
Where's Sayid and Hubert?

1004
01:10:08,533 --> 01:10:10,952
Don't know. They pissed me off tonight.

1005
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:13,621
You guys are always fussing!

1006
01:10:44,027 --> 01:10:45,445
Your sister's hot.

1007
01:10:46,154 --> 01:10:48,489
Shut up, asshole.

1008
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:50,742
Sorry, but she's hot.

1009
01:10:50,909 --> 01:10:52,785
You don't stand a chance.

1010
01:10:52,952 --> 01:10:54,996
Don't you try.

1011
01:10:56,289 --> 01:10:58,541
Don't even look at her!

1012
01:10:58,708 --> 01:11:00,335
Check the turn!

1013
01:11:00,501 --> 01:11:03,296
I won't try 'cause she's pregnant.

1014
01:11:03,463 --> 01:11:07,467
Don't diss my sis', butthead!

1015
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:21,272
Brothers, I got to make it

1016
01:11:21,439 --> 01:11:23,775
by any means necessary

1017
01:11:23,942 --> 01:11:26,361
'cos my mind's playing tricks on me.

1018
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:33,493
You won't let us in?

1019
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:35,453
Beat it!

1020
01:11:37,038 --> 01:11:41,334
That nigger bouncer never lets us in!

1021
01:11:41,501 --> 01:11:43,294
We know his bro for 10 years!

1022
01:11:43,461 --> 01:11:46,673
And he still gives us shit!

1023
01:11:47,131 --> 01:11:48,883
Drives me crazy!

1024
01:11:49,843 --> 01:11:51,970
What's up with the flare gun?

1025
01:11:53,054 --> 01:11:54,764
Where you going?

1026
01:11:55,098 --> 01:11:56,641
Don't be a hot dog!

1027
01:11:59,435 --> 01:12:00,603
Stop!

1028
01:12:01,271 --> 01:12:04,148
I told you I'd be back!

1029
01:12:05,775 --> 01:12:07,694
Not so big now, fuckface!

1030
01:12:07,861 --> 01:12:11,155
You and your stinking club!

1031
01:12:11,489 --> 01:12:14,617
Fuck your club!

1032
01:12:14,784 --> 01:12:17,161
Goddam nigger!

1033
01:12:35,638 --> 01:12:37,390
That cop made us miss it.

1034
01:12:38,433 --> 01:12:40,268
Dickless fucking Tracy!

1035
01:12:53,865 --> 01:12:55,575
When's the next one?

1036
01:12:55,992 --> 01:12:57,410
Tomorrow morning.

1037
01:13:38,451 --> 01:13:40,370
How much did Snoopy owe you?

1038
01:13:40,537 --> 01:13:41,329
What?

1039
01:13:41,496 --> 01:13:43,164
What'd he owe you?

1040
01:13:43,331 --> 01:13:44,582
One.

1041
01:13:44,749 --> 01:13:47,001
- $1,000? - No, $100.

1042
01:13:47,168 --> 01:13:48,294
What?

1043
01:13:48,545 --> 01:13:50,797
All this shit for a lousy $100!

1044
01:13:50,964 --> 01:13:53,716
It's the principle that counts.

1045
01:13:55,718 --> 01:13:57,512
Principle!

1046
01:13:59,764 --> 01:14:02,267
Coyote's a bad motherfucker.

1047
01:14:02,433 --> 01:14:05,019
Roadrunner's a pussy.

1048
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:07,730
Pick between Tweetie and Sylvester.

1049
01:14:08,398 --> 01:14:10,191
Fuck you and Tweetie!

1050
01:14:10,358 --> 01:14:13,486
I don't take shit from a guy who sees cows!

1051
01:14:13,653 --> 01:14:17,031
I say Sylvester's the real gangster.

1052
01:14:17,657 --> 01:14:19,534
Bottom line! 'Nuff said!

1053
01:14:19,701 --> 01:14:23,371
Can't talk with you guys if you won't listen.

1054
01:14:23,538 --> 01:14:25,164
'Cause you listen?

1055
01:14:25,331 --> 01:14:27,876
You got it all wrong.

1056
01:14:28,042 --> 01:14:32,172
I say Tweetie's the baddest. He always wins.

1057
01:14:32,463 --> 01:14:34,048
That's bullshit!

1058
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:37,177
Sylvester fucks Tweetie and you!

1059
01:14:37,802 --> 01:14:39,137
Come again?

1060
01:14:39,888 --> 01:14:42,140
Who does he fuck? Me?

1061
01:14:42,307 --> 01:14:44,225
Anyway, Sylvester's a black brother.

1062
01:14:44,392 --> 01:14:46,019
A black brother?

1063
01:14:46,436 --> 01:14:47,604
Full of shit!

1064
01:14:48,313 --> 01:14:50,690
Shall we, gentlemen?

1065
01:14:50,857 --> 01:14:52,692
What can we lose?

1066
01:15:00,533 --> 01:15:04,120
It's positively frightful!

1067
01:15:11,127 --> 01:15:12,837
Is this guy famous?

1068
01:15:14,839 --> 01:15:17,550
He will be when he grows up!

1069
01:15:34,901 --> 01:15:38,446
There's Champagne, Cinzano, Bogardi...

1070
01:15:38,613 --> 01:15:40,406
- I don't drink. - I mean Bacardi.

1071
01:15:40,573 --> 01:15:41,616
Outta my way.

1072
01:15:43,117 --> 01:15:44,536
I want peanuts.

1073
01:15:48,081 --> 01:15:49,541
Cheers, Charles!

1074
01:15:50,124 --> 01:15:52,001
Hey, Charles!

1075
01:15:52,168 --> 01:15:54,963
Behave, asshole!

1076
01:15:57,423 --> 01:15:59,968
Let 'em through, Sayid!

1077
01:16:01,177 --> 01:16:02,971
Check out the babes!

1078
01:16:03,137 --> 01:16:05,139
That's what I call women!

1079
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,976
The sister is hot.

1080
01:16:09,519 --> 01:16:10,687
Do me a favor.

1081
01:16:10,854 --> 01:16:12,564
I'm not going!

1082
01:16:12,897 --> 01:16:15,441
Who bought the tacos last week?

1083
01:16:15,608 --> 01:16:17,735
You owe me one.

1084
01:16:17,902 --> 01:16:19,237
Get me the sister.

1085
01:16:19,571 --> 01:16:20,738
All right.

1086
01:16:21,656 --> 01:16:23,449
There's just two!

1087
01:16:23,616 --> 01:16:25,118
- Who cares? - Shut up!

1088
01:16:25,285 --> 01:16:27,453
Get her for me, Hubert!

1089
01:16:33,668 --> 01:16:36,087
Excuse me, my name's Hubert.

1090
01:16:36,546 --> 01:16:40,675
My friend's a romantic, he's really shy.

1091
01:16:40,842 --> 01:16:43,261
He'd love to meet you.

1092
01:16:43,428 --> 01:16:44,846
That's him.

1093
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:47,974
What would you say?

1094
01:16:48,141 --> 01:16:50,435
Look what you did to me!

1095
01:16:51,311 --> 01:16:52,979
He's really cool.

1096
01:16:53,146 --> 01:16:56,482
- He's too nice. - OK, then!

1097
01:16:56,649 --> 01:16:57,984
Come on Sayid!

1098
01:16:59,110 --> 01:17:00,236
Hold this.

1099
01:17:02,071 --> 01:17:04,240
Haven't we met before?

1100
01:17:04,449 --> 01:17:05,825
Don't I wish!

1101
01:17:05,992 --> 01:17:07,243
Hi, girls!

1102
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:08,077
I'm Sayid.

1103
01:17:10,246 --> 01:17:12,582
Please don't lean on the painting.

1104
01:17:12,749 --> 01:17:13,833
You're the painting!

1105
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:16,544
I'm good at what?

1106
01:17:16,711 --> 01:17:17,921
Guess, babe!

1107
01:17:18,087 --> 01:17:19,923
We heard you were shy!

1108
01:17:20,089 --> 01:17:23,510
Shy? That's my middle name!

1109
01:17:24,302 --> 01:17:26,888
What's your number? We'll go out.

1110
01:17:27,055 --> 01:17:29,557
You're all alike!

1111
01:17:29,724 --> 01:17:31,893
He said you wanted to talk.

1112
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:34,521
Talk? What about?

1113
01:17:35,897 --> 01:17:38,691
Lighten up! We were ready to talk,

1114
01:17:38,858 --> 01:17:42,946
but with your attitude, how can we respect you?

1115
01:17:43,112 --> 01:17:46,491
Who are you? The Wonderbra bitch?

1116
01:17:46,658 --> 01:17:49,160
- Who asked you? - I'm asking you!

1117
01:17:49,327 --> 01:17:50,954
He's nuts.

1118
01:17:51,371 --> 01:17:53,706
What are you staring at?

1119
01:17:54,207 --> 01:17:55,458
Got a screw loose?

1120
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:57,627
You're the screw.

1121
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:02,340
- Stop! - What's wrong with you?

1122
01:18:03,132 --> 01:18:06,636
Leave us alone, we didn't ask you over!

1123
01:18:06,803 --> 01:18:08,513
Gentlemen, please!

1124
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,723
It's cool, Pops!

1125
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:14,769
Nobody's been hurt! What's your beef?

1126
01:18:14,936 --> 01:18:17,772
- Keep your heads, please. - Please what?

1127
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:20,024
Let's go!

1128
01:18:20,567 --> 01:18:22,193
Pretty please!

1129
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,821
Let's all calm down!

1130
01:18:25,154 --> 01:18:26,406
Stop that!

1131
01:18:26,573 --> 01:18:27,949
Stop your friend.

1132
01:18:28,116 --> 01:18:30,869
You're not my friend! Fuck you!

1133
01:18:32,996 --> 01:18:34,330
Know what?

1134
01:18:34,789 --> 01:18:36,916
Go suck cocks in hell!

1135
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:40,461
- With your mothers! - You're all ugly!

1136
01:18:40,628 --> 01:18:43,214
I'm fucking sorry, sir!

1137
01:18:46,301 --> 01:18:48,553
Have fun, mothafuckas!

1138
01:18:51,806 --> 01:18:53,224
Troubled youth!

1139
01:18:53,391 --> 01:18:55,310
We should have swiped a bottle.

1140
01:18:55,476 --> 01:18:58,479
I got the sucker's charge card!

1141
01:18:58,646 --> 01:19:01,316
Hubert! Up to your old tricks!

1142
01:19:01,482 --> 01:19:03,568
Like riding a bike: You don't forget.

1143
01:19:03,735 --> 01:19:06,321
Mr. David Moe?

1144
01:19:08,448 --> 01:19:10,074
He's not here?

1145
01:19:10,825 --> 01:19:12,327
We keep it for him!

1146
01:19:12,493 --> 01:19:14,245
Give it to me.

1147
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,832
What's the score?

1148
01:19:17,999 --> 01:19:19,209
Killer!

1149
01:19:19,584 --> 01:19:21,377
Know what I'm saying?

1150
01:19:22,754 --> 01:19:24,881
Your name's not David!

1151
01:19:25,048 --> 01:19:27,008
And cabs don't take plastic.

1152
01:19:27,175 --> 01:19:28,468
Just this once.

1153
01:19:28,635 --> 01:19:30,762
Gimme a break!

1154
01:19:35,517 --> 01:19:36,726
You fart?

1155
01:19:37,101 --> 01:19:38,520
It was you. Who else?

1156
01:19:38,686 --> 01:19:41,064
It stinks. Had to be you.

1157
01:19:41,231 --> 01:19:42,315
That's not my stink.

1158
01:19:42,482 --> 01:19:43,983
I know your farts.

1159
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:46,611
Mothafucka, we're locked out.

1160
01:19:52,367 --> 01:19:53,409
Who farted?

1161
01:19:53,576 --> 01:19:54,911
- He did. - He did.

1162
01:19:56,704 --> 01:19:58,581
Can't you tell?

1163
01:20:00,166 --> 01:20:01,543
It was him.

1164
01:20:01,709 --> 01:20:03,962
Your ass reeks.

1165
01:20:04,921 --> 01:20:08,508
Motherfucking goddam steering wheel!

1166
01:20:08,675 --> 01:20:10,802
Cut the poetry

1167
01:20:10,969 --> 01:20:12,846
and pull the thing!

1168
01:20:13,012 --> 01:20:16,432
Jean-Claude does this in five seconds flat.

1169
01:20:16,599 --> 01:20:17,725
Which Jean-Claude?

1170
01:20:17,892 --> 01:20:18,935
The mailman?

1171
01:20:19,102 --> 01:20:22,689
No, that's Sylvie's boyfriend.

1172
01:20:22,856 --> 01:20:25,358
This guy got 2 years for car theft.

1173
01:20:25,525 --> 01:20:27,735
Move it, bust the fucker!

1174
01:20:27,902 --> 01:20:31,155
Use your foot!

1175
01:20:52,802 --> 01:20:54,137
Don't be a sissy.

1176
01:20:54,304 --> 01:20:56,681
Who's a sissy?

1177
01:21:01,269 --> 01:21:03,438
Relax, Max.

1178
01:21:13,364 --> 01:21:16,743
"Night of the Living Car!"

1179
01:21:18,745 --> 01:21:20,622
The wipers!

1180
01:21:25,335 --> 01:21:27,295
Rip open that plastic box.

1181
01:21:27,462 --> 01:21:29,214
Open sesame!

1182
01:21:31,549 --> 01:21:35,386
Connect the green wire to the red one.

1183
01:21:35,553 --> 01:21:37,931
Nah, that's for the blinkers.

1184
01:21:38,097 --> 01:21:40,475
How'd they do it in on TV?

1185
01:21:40,642 --> 01:21:42,894
Fuck TV!

1186
01:21:43,937 --> 01:21:46,773
Start the mother!

1187
01:21:50,693 --> 01:21:51,861
Who the fuck is he?

1188
01:21:54,113 --> 01:21:55,907
Freaked me out!

1189
01:21:56,991 --> 01:21:58,660
Who the fuck are you?

1190
01:21:58,826 --> 01:22:00,495
- Huh? - What you doing?

1191
01:22:00,662 --> 01:22:01,746
Nothing.

1192
01:22:01,955 --> 01:22:03,748
So go somewhere else.

1193
01:22:03,915 --> 01:22:05,917
Move, you'll get us nabbed.

1194
01:22:06,084 --> 01:22:07,293
It's my wife...

1195
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:08,586
What about her?

1196
01:22:10,004 --> 01:22:10,880
She left me.

1197
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,008
Do we fucking care?

1198
01:22:15,969 --> 01:22:18,096
Don't wait for the law, start it.

1199
01:22:18,263 --> 01:22:20,056
Move!

1200
01:22:20,223 --> 01:22:22,433
The red wire to the green wire.

1201
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:25,270
Lay off, that's for the horn!

1202
01:22:25,436 --> 01:22:26,646
Try the blue, jerk!

1203
01:22:27,564 --> 01:22:30,984
You do it! If you're so smart.

1204
01:22:31,150 --> 01:22:32,360
I'll kill you!

1205
01:22:34,237 --> 01:22:35,905
You're a drag.

1206
01:22:36,823 --> 01:22:39,033
That wire's for the horn.

1207
01:22:39,909 --> 01:22:40,702
No, that's the horn!

1208
01:22:42,829 --> 01:22:44,664
Sayid's right.

1209
01:22:44,831 --> 01:22:46,749
You see?

1210
01:22:46,916 --> 01:22:49,836
Who was right? We do it my way!

1211
01:22:50,003 --> 01:22:51,629
Gimme some metal!

1212
01:22:51,796 --> 01:22:53,256
Move it!

1213
01:22:54,549 --> 01:22:56,551
You're a good guy. What's your name?

1214
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,346
You got a name?

1215
01:23:02,891 --> 01:23:05,518
At least we put it to good use!

1216
01:23:07,061 --> 01:23:09,480
Ready? Watch this.

1217
01:23:22,452 --> 01:23:24,287
Anyone know how to drive?

1218
01:23:24,704 --> 01:23:27,248
- Vinz does. - Wait a second.

1219
01:23:27,415 --> 01:23:30,084
I never learned, I got no license.

1220
01:23:30,335 --> 01:23:32,462
He does. He was in the Army.

1221
01:23:32,629 --> 01:23:34,923
The Navy! I can't drive.

1222
01:23:35,507 --> 01:23:36,799
I can!

1223
01:23:36,966 --> 01:23:38,343
Shut up!

1224
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:41,221
- Vinz? - What?

1225
01:23:41,387 --> 01:23:45,517
You took that bitch around Israel in a Mercedes.

1226
01:23:46,017 --> 01:23:48,895
Not the same thing!

1227
01:23:49,062 --> 01:23:51,231
That was different. It was... uh...

1228
01:23:51,397 --> 01:23:53,900
It was an automatic...

1229
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,360
More like a dream!

1230
01:23:58,071 --> 01:24:00,073
You guys are so lame!

1231
01:24:02,992 --> 01:24:04,619
Now what?

1232
01:24:06,371 --> 01:24:09,707
Sorry, but a cop car's coming.

1233
01:24:09,874 --> 01:24:11,918
- Where? - That's a cop car.

1234
01:24:12,085 --> 01:24:13,127
It's real close.

1235
01:24:15,839 --> 01:24:18,258
On three, we're outta here, OK?

1236
01:24:18,842 --> 01:24:19,551
Ready?

1237
01:24:19,717 --> 01:24:20,218
Three!

1238
01:24:27,684 --> 01:24:29,185
Freeze!

1239
01:24:32,188 --> 01:24:34,983
Out of the way!

1240
01:24:41,322 --> 01:24:42,991
"You down with OCB?"

1241
01:24:43,157 --> 01:24:44,826
"Yeah, you know me..."

1242
01:24:44,993 --> 01:24:46,578
"You're down with OCB?"

1243
01:24:46,744 --> 01:24:48,621
"Yeah, you know me..."

1244
01:24:48,872 --> 01:24:50,748
"Yeah, you know me..."

1245
01:24:52,041 --> 01:24:54,711
Sometimes you feel so fucking small...

1246
01:24:55,253 --> 01:24:57,255
Got any more bullshit wisdom?

1247
01:24:57,422 --> 01:25:00,341
"The early bird catches the worm."

1248
01:25:00,508 --> 01:25:03,011
"A stitch in time saves nine."

1249
01:25:03,178 --> 01:25:06,139
"Haste makes waste."

1250
01:25:06,306 --> 01:25:08,766
"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity."

1251
01:25:08,933 --> 01:25:12,103
I save that one for special occasions.

1252
01:25:12,812 --> 01:25:15,190
Holy fuck!

1253
01:25:15,773 --> 01:25:17,942
I'm wasted.

1254
01:25:18,109 --> 01:25:20,320
Your shit is dope!

1255
01:25:22,322 --> 01:25:23,406
Sayid, watch it!

1256
01:25:24,991 --> 01:25:25,950
He's a big boy!

1257
01:25:26,117 --> 01:25:28,036
- Spray cans! - You're the can!

1258
01:25:28,953 --> 01:25:32,457
What was that old guy in the john trying to say?

1259
01:25:32,624 --> 01:25:36,169
Talked about God and shitting. What was the point?

1260
01:25:36,336 --> 01:25:37,754
I see skinheads.

1261
01:25:37,921 --> 01:25:39,172
You're the skinhead.

1262
01:25:39,339 --> 01:25:40,256
Fuck Nazis!

1263
01:25:40,423 --> 01:25:42,926
The point is: God's inside you,

1264
01:25:43,092 --> 01:25:44,636
so He helps you dump!

1265
01:25:44,802 --> 01:25:47,138
God loves your bowels.

1266
01:25:47,305 --> 01:25:48,389
Pass the joint.

1267
01:25:51,768 --> 01:25:53,228
Check this shit out:

1268
01:25:54,312 --> 01:25:58,358
"Pinhead is to skinhead, as teeny is to weenie."

1269
01:25:58,525 --> 01:26:00,735
Get my drift?

1270
01:26:01,027 --> 01:26:02,612
Out of the way.

1271
01:26:12,914 --> 01:26:16,876
Know the one about the guy falling off a skyscraper?

1272
01:26:17,126 --> 01:26:20,171
On the way down he says to himself:

1273
01:26:20,338 --> 01:26:24,926
"So far so good... so far so good..."

1274
01:26:27,595 --> 01:26:29,764
I heard it with a rabbi.

1275
01:26:30,265 --> 01:26:34,602
Like us in the projects. So far so good,

1276
01:26:35,144 --> 01:26:36,604
but how will we land?

1277
01:26:37,188 --> 01:26:40,567
I feel like an ant lost in intergalactic space.

1278
01:26:44,237 --> 01:26:46,656
Watch, I'll switch off the Eiffel Tower.

1279
01:26:52,745 --> 01:26:54,998
That only works in movies.

1280
01:26:55,165 --> 01:26:56,541
Mothafucka!

1281
01:26:56,708 --> 01:26:58,001
You in a movie?

1282
01:26:58,168 --> 01:26:59,961
In a porn flick with your mother!

1283
01:27:00,128 --> 01:27:01,880
Look who's talking!

1284
01:27:02,046 --> 01:27:05,383
Yours sticks carrots up her ass!

1285
01:27:07,427 --> 01:27:09,554
You're the carrot!

1286
01:27:18,563 --> 01:27:20,732
THE WORLD IS YOURS

1287
01:27:32,577 --> 01:27:35,496
THE WORLD IS OURS

1288
01:27:43,171 --> 01:27:46,925
How did they get the car in the gym?

1289
01:27:47,091 --> 01:27:49,636
Search me... Ask God!

1290
01:27:49,969 --> 01:27:50,553
Very funny.

1291
01:28:00,104 --> 01:28:03,233
Look at those sheep in the system.

1292
01:28:03,399 --> 01:28:08,404
They look cute in their fancy leather jackets.

1293
01:28:08,571 --> 01:28:10,198
But they're scumbags.

1294
01:28:10,365 --> 01:28:13,910
They ride escalators, carried by the system.

1295
01:28:14,494 --> 01:28:16,829
They vote far right, but aren't racists.

1296
01:28:16,996 --> 01:28:20,166
They can't move without escalators.

1297
01:28:20,333 --> 01:28:21,960
The worst!

1298
01:28:24,963 --> 01:28:26,339
Racist!

1299
01:29:05,587 --> 01:29:07,422
WAR IN BOSNIA

1300
01:29:15,847 --> 01:29:17,891
ABDEL ICHAHA DIES

1301
01:29:41,831 --> 01:29:43,333
Where's Vinz?

1302
01:29:51,299 --> 01:29:53,384
Mothafucka!

1303
01:30:12,862 --> 01:30:13,821
What?

1304
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:17,242
Dumb fuck!

1305
01:30:17,408 --> 01:30:20,328
What did I do?

1306
01:30:22,622 --> 01:30:23,540
Why hit me?

1307
01:30:27,377 --> 01:30:28,920
What did I do?

1308
01:30:30,922 --> 01:30:32,674
What'd I do, asshole?

1309
01:30:32,841 --> 01:30:34,384
You suck big time!

1310
01:30:34,551 --> 01:30:36,135
So what would I do?

1311
01:30:36,302 --> 01:30:38,513
Help me, Sayid! Please.

1312
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:41,432
Help you what? What'd I do?

1313
01:30:41,599 --> 01:30:42,892
Abdel's dead now!

1314
01:30:43,059 --> 01:30:44,853
He's sick of your shit!

1315
01:30:45,019 --> 01:30:46,145
What shit?

1316
01:30:46,312 --> 01:30:48,398
What the fuck I do?

1317
01:30:49,315 --> 01:30:53,027
You want to kill a pig, go right ahead.

1318
01:30:54,487 --> 01:30:56,197
But you're on your own.

1319
01:30:56,447 --> 01:30:58,157
We're outta here.

1320
01:31:02,245 --> 01:31:03,746
Get lost.

1321
01:31:04,247 --> 01:31:05,874
Both of you!

1322
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:10,170
I don't need you!

1323
01:31:13,548 --> 01:31:16,593
I know who I am and where I come from!

1324
01:31:16,759 --> 01:31:19,220
So go home and shut up!

1325
01:31:19,387 --> 01:31:21,806
Fuck your mother!

1326
01:31:38,823 --> 01:31:40,158
Don't bug me, Sayid.

1327
01:31:40,325 --> 01:31:41,951
Think we should've...

1328
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:46,915
Just what we need!

1329
01:31:47,081 --> 01:31:48,249
A nigger!

1330
01:31:49,709 --> 01:31:52,921
You're the fucker who dissed us from the roof!

1331
01:31:53,087 --> 01:31:55,256
The gang banger from the roof?

1332
01:31:55,423 --> 01:31:58,092
Let's see you fight!

1333
01:32:01,846 --> 01:32:03,264
Hold him!

1334
01:32:08,102 --> 01:32:10,688
Come back!

1335
01:32:10,855 --> 01:32:12,565
You fucking asshole!

1336
01:32:12,732 --> 01:32:13,775
I done nothing!

1337
01:32:13,942 --> 01:32:15,610
Faster than a speeding bullet?

1338
01:32:15,777 --> 01:32:18,071
I've done nothing!

1339
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:20,031
Check it out!

1340
01:32:21,616 --> 01:32:22,909
What would you say?

1341
01:32:31,709 --> 01:32:34,045
Get the fuck in there!

1342
01:32:44,097 --> 01:32:45,557
What are you going to do?

1343
01:32:47,851 --> 01:32:49,686
You think I'm all talk?

1344
01:32:49,853 --> 01:32:51,855
I'm all talk?

1345
01:32:54,190 --> 01:32:57,777
Watch! Don't try and stop me!

1346
01:32:59,112 --> 01:33:01,447
- Vinz, don't do it! - Let him!

1347
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:04,367
Do your good deed!

1348
01:33:05,118 --> 01:33:06,160
Shut up!

1349
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:08,329
There are good cops.

1350
01:33:08,496 --> 01:33:11,499
But the only good skinhead is a dead one!

1351
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:13,501
Shoot him.

1352
01:33:13,668 --> 01:33:17,005
We took your shit all day. Fucking shoot him!

1353
01:33:17,714 --> 01:33:18,965
You got the piece.

1354
01:33:22,969 --> 01:33:24,262
Shoot!

1355
01:33:26,848 --> 01:33:27,473
Shoot!

1356
01:33:32,187 --> 01:33:33,646
Fuck his mother!

1357
01:33:34,022 --> 01:33:35,106
Shoot!

1358
01:33:38,443 --> 01:33:41,696
Abdel's dead! Get even, for fuck is sake!

1359
01:33:41,863 --> 01:33:43,656
Do it for Abdel!

1360
01:33:47,911 --> 01:33:48,912
Shoot!

1361
01:33:59,297 --> 01:34:01,299
Get outta here!

1362
01:34:30,245 --> 01:34:31,788
See ya tomorrow.

1363
01:34:45,009 --> 01:34:46,261
Take it.

1364
01:34:50,515 --> 01:34:52,183
Going to sing a love song?

1365
01:34:52,350 --> 01:34:53,726
Go home, loser.

1366
01:34:53,893 --> 01:34:56,938
Let's go, Vinz.

1367
01:34:57,146 --> 01:34:58,565
Later, Hubert.

1368
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,359
Hear the one about the nun?

1369
01:35:01,526 --> 01:35:04,028
This drunk guy comes out of a bar,

1370
01:35:04,195 --> 01:35:07,699
and walks up to a nun in this big black cape.

1371
01:35:07,866 --> 01:35:11,494
Wham! He slugs her in her teeth. She goes down

1372
01:35:11,661 --> 01:35:14,330
and he keeps on pounding her.

1373
01:35:16,082 --> 01:35:18,334
After about 5 minutes he stops,

1374
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:21,129
looks at her and says:

1375
01:35:21,296 --> 01:35:23,298
"You're not so tough, Batman!"

1376
01:35:23,464 --> 01:35:25,675
That's a killer!

1377
01:35:26,009 --> 01:35:28,052
He thought the nun was Batman!

1378
01:35:28,219 --> 01:35:30,471
I heard it with a rabbi.

1379
01:35:31,514 --> 01:35:32,515
Over here, you!

1380
01:35:32,932 --> 01:35:34,309
What's the matter?

1381
01:35:34,893 --> 01:35:36,186
I know you!

1382
01:35:38,897 --> 01:35:40,398
You were on the roof!

1383
01:35:52,118 --> 01:35:53,703
What're you doing?

1384
01:35:55,497 --> 01:35:57,373
Got a problem, you fuck?

1385
01:35:57,874 --> 01:35:59,876
Scared without your pals?

1386
01:36:00,793 --> 01:36:02,295
Not so tough now!

1387
01:36:02,462 --> 01:36:04,756
Look at him!

1388
01:36:31,908 --> 01:36:34,060
It's about a society falling...

1389
01:36:34,127 --> 01:36:38,340
On the way down it keeps telling itself:

1390
01:36:38,632 --> 01:36:40,467
"So far so good...

1391
01:36:41,343 --> 01:36:43,136
"so far so good...

1392
01:36:44,095 --> 01:36:46,222
"so far so good..."

1393
01:36:47,724 --> 01:36:49,726
How you fall doesn't matter.

1394
01:36:51,311 --> 01:36:52,979
It's how you land!
