1
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,025
'and in their triumph die,
like fire and powder,

2
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:10,203
'which, as they kiss, consume.'

3
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,490
Gran?

4
00:02:03,382 --> 00:02:05,932
Edward, don't. She'll see you.

5
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:13,682
Hmm.

6
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:18,354
Okay.

7
00:02:27,865 --> 00:02:30,330
Gran, I'd like you to meet...

8
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:01,605
Happy birthday, Bella.

9
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,370
Happy birthday.

10
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:22,278
I thought we agreed, no presents.

11
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:27,138
Well, the one from me is not wrapped,
so it doesn't count.

12
00:03:30,261 --> 00:03:32,705
That's actually great. Thanks, Dad.

13
00:03:32,805 --> 00:03:36,834
It goes with this one from your mom.
We coordinated.

14
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:39,059
Well, she coordinated me.

15
00:03:40,897 --> 00:03:44,807
It's to put your pictures in from senior year.

16
00:03:45,943 --> 00:03:48,069
Senior year.

17
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,850
How'd you get so old so fast?
- l didn't. It's not that old.

18
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,840
I don't know. Is that a grey hair?

19
00:03:56,204 --> 00:03:58,204
No. No way.

20
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:03,319
Happy birthday.

21
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:05,419
That's really funny.

22
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,283
Another missing hiker brings the
total to three presumed dead.

23
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:13,208
Rangers are searching
for the killer animal...

24
00:04:20,353 --> 00:04:22,353
It's Bella. Bella.

25
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:24,647
Hi.

26
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,695
Today's the big day, Bella.

27
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,403
R and J essay due.

28
00:04:31,489 --> 00:04:34,634
Oh, yeah.
- Wherefore art thou, Bella?

29
00:04:35,826 --> 00:04:39,605
Let me take a picture of you guys.
My mom wants me to put together, like,

30
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:40,815
a scrapbook full of memories.

31
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:41,899
Oh.
- Cool. Yeah.

32
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:43,317
I take them. I'm not in them.

33
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:44,777
No, no, no, come here.
- Well, you are today.

34
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:46,237
You'll Photoshop this
if my nose looks big, right?

35
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:50,116
Don't worry, I’m in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.

36
00:04:50,216 --> 00:04:52,216
That's good.

37
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:54,386
Oh, good. Cullen's here.

38
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,432
Well, talk to you later.

39
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:24,108
Happy birthday.
- Don't remind me.

40
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,208
Mmm.

41
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:29,447
Bella, your birth is definitely
something to celebrate.

42
00:05:29,547 --> 00:05:32,777
Yeah, but my aging's not.
- Your aging?

43
00:05:34,593 --> 00:05:37,371
I think 18 is a little young
to start worrying about that.

44
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,081
It’s one year older than you.

45
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:41,725
No, it isn't. I’m 109.

46
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:45,129
Well, maybe I shouldn't be
dating such an old man.

47
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:46,229
Mmm.

48
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:48,758
It’s gross. I should be thoroughly repulsed.

49
00:05:48,858 --> 00:05:50,858
Uh-huh.

50
00:06:00,619 --> 00:06:03,169
We have to go to class.
- Okay.

51
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:09,793
Wait a second.

52
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:12,254
Someone wants you.

53
00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:14,715
Bella.
- Jacob.

54
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:17,134
What?

55
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:20,221
I'll leave you to talk.

56
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:29,257
Hello, Biceps. You know, anabolic
steroids are really bad for you.

57
00:06:29,357 --> 00:06:31,634
Well, I’m just filling out, Bella.

58
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:35,554
You know, it wouldn't seem so
drastic if we hung out more.

59
00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:38,516
You should switch schools.
You can come hang out with the palefaces.

60
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:42,603
I’m all right.
I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.

61
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:45,147
They let any old riffraff into this place.

62
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,316
I see. Then why are you slumming it?
- Mmm-hmm.

63
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,860
l was just buying a part for the Rabbit.

64
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,488
You should really come
take a ride when it's done.

65
00:06:52,588 --> 00:06:53,990
Is it fast?

66
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:55,783
Um.

67
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,883
It’s decent.

68
00:06:58,135 --> 00:07:00,430
I’m kidding.
- Okay. Good.

69
00:07:01,138 --> 00:07:03,264
Hey, happy birthday.

70
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:07,104
Your dad told my dad, so...

71
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:09,645
Yeah, of course he did.

72
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:13,887
I saw this the other day and thought of you.

73
00:07:14,318 --> 00:07:16,318
Catches bad dreams.

74
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:20,156
That's kind of perfect.

75
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:24,186
Thank you.

76
00:07:24,286 --> 00:07:26,286
No problem.

77
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:29,066
Good seeing you.
- Yeah, I’ll see you later.

78
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:31,166
Bye.

79
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:36,532
So how come Jacob Black
gets to give you a gift and I don't?

80
00:07:36,632 --> 00:07:40,077
Because I have nothing to give back to you.

81
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:44,172
Bella, you give me everything
just by breathing.

82
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:47,015
See? Thank you.

83
00:07:47,143 --> 00:07:49,353
That's all l want.
- Bella.

84
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,981
Happy birthday.
- Shh, shh.

85
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:56,927
I thought I said no presents.

86
00:07:57,027 --> 00:07:59,138
I've already seen you
open it, and guess what,

87
00:07:59,238 --> 00:08:00,639
you love it.

88
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:04,139
You're gonna wear it tonight. Our place.

89
00:08:05,286 --> 00:08:08,288
Come on. Please? It'll be fun.

90
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:14,294
Okay. All right.
- Great.

91
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:16,843
Okay, I’ll see you at 7:00.

92
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:22,289
Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing.

93
00:08:23,095 --> 00:08:25,680
Sorry, Bella. Happy...

94
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:29,016
Never mind.

95
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:33,938
You can't trust vampires. Trust me.

96
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:36,983
O my love. My wife.

97
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:39,929
Death, that hath sucked
the honey of thy breath...

98
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:43,514
...hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.

99
00:08:43,616 --> 00:08:45,616
Thou art not conquered.

100
00:08:46,952 --> 00:08:51,607
Beauty's ensign yet is crimson
in thy lips and in thy cheeks.

101
00:08:51,707 --> 00:08:54,527
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.

102
00:08:54,627 --> 00:08:56,667
I hate being celebrated.

103
00:08:57,296 --> 00:09:00,199
There are worse tragedies.
l mean, look at Romeo.

104
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:04,039
Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity.

105
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:06,664
Yeah.

106
00:09:06,764 --> 00:09:09,399
Though l do envy him one thing.

107
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:12,934
Juliet is, like, perfect.

108
00:09:12,937 --> 00:09:17,187
If you like that obviously
beautiful sort of thing.

109
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:22,445
Not the girl, the suicide.

110
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:29,002
It’s nearly impossible for...

111
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:32,705
For some people.

112
00:09:35,376 --> 00:09:38,628
For humans, a little poison,

113
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,715
a dagger to the heart.

114
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:46,899
There's so many different options.

115
00:09:49,848 --> 00:09:51,848
Why would you say that?

116
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,950
Because I had to consider it once.

117
00:09:57,773 --> 00:10:00,342
I didn't know if I’d get to you in time.

118
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:03,842
I had to come up with some kind of plan.

119
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:06,557
What was the plan?

120
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:10,652
That I’d go to Italy and provoke the Volturi.

121
00:10:10,953 --> 00:10:13,162
The what?
- The Volturi.

122
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:16,692
Now, who'd like to repeat
the last few lines of iambic pentameter...

123
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:19,653
...just to show they were paying attention?

124
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,753
Mr Cullen?

125
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:26,174
Yes, Mr Berty.

126
00:10:28,554 --> 00:10:32,432
'O here will I set up my everlasting rest...

127
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:39,340
'and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this world-wearied flesh.

128
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
'Eyes, look your last.

129
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,450
'Arms, take your last embrace.

130
00:10:45,154 --> 00:10:48,469
'And, lips, O you, the doors of breath,

131
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:54,394
'seal with a righteous kiss a dateless
bargain to engrossing death.'

132
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:57,584
Eyes on the screen, people.

133
00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:01,377
Thus with a kiss I die.

134
00:11:04,715 --> 00:11:08,452
The Volturi are a very old,
very powerful family.

135
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:12,706
l guess they're the closest thing
to royalty my world has.

136
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,016
Is that Carlisle?
- Yeah.

137
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:18,379
He lived with them for a few decades.

138
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:23,926
Described them as very refined.
No respect for human life, of course,

139
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:28,531
but a respect for the arts
and the sciences, at least.

140
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:31,031
And the law.

141
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:33,533
Above all, the law.

142
00:11:36,538 --> 00:11:38,538
Vampires have laws?

143
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,833
Not very many.

144
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:45,943
And only one that's regularly enforced.

145
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:49,966
What is it?

146
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:53,956
That we keep the existence
of our kind a secret.

147
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:57,286
We don't make spectacles of ourselves,

148
00:11:58,977 --> 00:12:01,697
and we don't kill conspicuously.

149
00:12:05,442 --> 00:12:08,417
Unless, of course, you want to die.

150
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:24,361
You gotta stop talking about that.

151
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:28,256
I can't even think about
someone hurting you.

152
00:12:30,843 --> 00:12:34,929
Bella, the only thing
that can hurt me is you.

153
00:12:37,307 --> 00:12:39,752
And I don't have anything
else to be afraid of.

154
00:12:39,852 --> 00:12:41,852
That's not true.

155
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:46,542
Victoria? She'll come for me one day.

156
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:51,571
Alice will see when she
decides, and we'll be ready.

157
00:12:51,822 --> 00:12:53,822
I could protect you...

158
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,700
...if you change me.

159
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:59,966
Bella, you already do protect me.

160
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,580
You're my only reason...

161
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:07,169
...to stay alive,

162
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:09,629
if that's what I am.

163
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,435
But it's my job to protect you.

164
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:20,767
From everyone except my sister.

165
00:13:20,851 --> 00:13:25,186
It’s time. It’s time. It’s time. It’s time.

166
00:13:34,865 --> 00:13:36,517
Sorry about all this.

167
00:13:36,617 --> 00:13:39,436
We tried to rein Alice in.
- As if that were even possible.

168
00:13:39,536 --> 00:13:42,171
Happy birthday, Bella.
- Thanks.

169
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,960
I found it in your bag. You mind?

170
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:51,007
Dating an older woman. Hot.

171
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:55,385
What?
- You first, Rosalie.

172
00:13:58,263 --> 00:14:01,578
It’s a necklace. Alice picked it out.

173
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:03,767
Thanks.

174
00:14:05,729 --> 00:14:07,729
Show me the love.

175
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:13,110
This one's from Emmett.

176
00:14:15,572 --> 00:14:18,058
Already installed it in your truck.

177
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:19,560
Finally a decent sound system...

178
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,147
...for that piece of...
- Hey. Don't hate the truck.

179
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:25,414
Open Esme and Carlisle's.

180
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,153
Just a little something to brighten your day.

181
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:33,078
Yes, you've been looking kind of pale lately.

182
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:39,511
Ow.

183
00:14:40,264 --> 00:14:42,264
Paper cut.

184
00:15:06,331 --> 00:15:10,241
Jaz, Jaz. It’s okay. It’s just a little...

185
00:15:11,795 --> 00:15:13,795
...blood.

186
00:15:19,636 --> 00:15:21,636
Get Jasper out of here.

187
00:15:27,311 --> 00:15:29,604
I’m sorry, I can't.

188
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,554
I’ll have to stitch this up in my office.

189
00:15:36,987 --> 00:15:38,987
Check on Jasper.

190
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:40,849
I’m sure he's very upset with himself,

191
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:44,394
and I doubt he'll listen to anyone
but you right now.

192
00:15:44,494 --> 00:15:46,494
Edward.

193
00:15:57,174 --> 00:16:01,849
l never wanted to have a party.
- It’s not your fault.

194
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:07,501
Jasper hasn't been away from human
blood as long as the rest of us.

195
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:09,601
How do you do it?

196
00:16:10,187 --> 00:16:12,567
Years and years of practice.

197
00:16:12,856 --> 00:16:16,936
Did you ever think of just
doing it the easy way?

198
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,570
No.

199
00:16:20,822 --> 00:16:25,072
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.

200
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:30,042
It brings me happiness, even
if l am damned regardless.

201
00:16:31,249 --> 00:16:33,249
Damned?

202
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:36,295
Like hell?

203
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:45,524
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.

204
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:48,275
You couldn't. It’s impossible.

205
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,960
Thank you, Bella.

206
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,188
You've always been very gracious about us.

207
00:16:58,235 --> 00:17:01,890
So that's it?
That's why he won't change me?

208
00:17:04,574 --> 00:17:07,804
Imagine the situation in reverse. Hmm.

209
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,714
If you believed as Edward does,

210
00:17:12,874 --> 00:17:15,339
could you take away his soul?

211
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:40,275
You can't protect me...

212
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:44,279
...from everything.

213
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:48,146
At some point, something's
gonna separate us.

214
00:17:49,077 --> 00:17:52,562
It’s gonna be an accident or illness...

215
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,873
...or old age,

216
00:17:56,043 --> 00:18:01,228
as long as I’m human.
And the only solution is to change me.

217
00:18:02,924 --> 00:18:05,619
That's not a solution. That's a tragedy.

218
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:10,394
You're not gonna want me when
I look like a grandmother.

219
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,115
Bella, do you not understand
my feelings for you at all?

220
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:27,614
Carlisle told me...

221
00:18:30,494 --> 00:18:33,214
...how you feel about your soul.

222
00:18:34,206 --> 00:18:36,206
I don't believe that.

223
00:18:37,209 --> 00:18:39,419
So don't worry about mine.

224
00:18:40,462 --> 00:18:42,462
You should go inside.

225
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,145
It’s still my birthday.

226
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:04,568
So can I ask one thing?

227
00:19:08,156 --> 00:19:10,156
Kiss me?

228
00:19:40,814 --> 00:19:46,193
I love you.

229
00:20:15,098 --> 00:20:17,308
Up with your turret

230
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:23,564
Aren't we just terrified?

231
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:38,746
Shale, screen your worry

232
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:43,792
From what you won't ever find

233
00:20:53,178 --> 00:21:01,477
Don't let it fool you

234
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:04,188
Down

235
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:10,109
Hey.

236
00:21:13,198 --> 00:21:15,748
Just come take a walk with me.

237
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:41,432
We have to leave Forks.

238
00:21:44,646 --> 00:21:46,646
Why?

239
00:21:49,484 --> 00:21:52,929
Carlisle's supposed to be 10
years older than he looks,

240
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:55,919
and people are starting to notice.

241
00:21:58,118 --> 00:22:02,793
Okay, I’ve gotta think of
something to say to Charlie.

242
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:15,967
When you say 'we'...

243
00:22:20,056 --> 00:22:22,436
I mean my family and myself.

244
00:22:26,438 --> 00:22:30,258
Edward, what happened with
Jasper, it's nothing.

245
00:22:30,358 --> 00:22:33,068
You're right. It was nothing,

246
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:38,800
nothing but what l always expected...

247
00:22:40,201 --> 00:22:44,536
...and nothing compared to
what could have happened.

248
00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:52,904
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.

249
00:22:57,302 --> 00:22:59,302
I belong with you.

250
00:23:00,764 --> 00:23:03,098
No. You don't.

251
00:23:05,602 --> 00:23:07,602
I’m coming.

252
00:23:08,104 --> 00:23:10,104
Bella,

253
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,025
I don't want you to come.

254
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:22,575
You don't want me?

255
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,083
No.

256
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:36,298
That changes things a lot.

257
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:40,521
But if it's not too much to ask,

258
00:23:42,055 --> 00:23:44,945
can you just promise me something?

259
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:49,188
Don't do anything reckless.

260
00:23:51,815 --> 00:23:53,815
For Charlie's sake.

261
00:23:55,026 --> 00:23:57,971
And I’ll promise
something to you in return.

262
00:23:58,071 --> 00:24:01,391
This is the last time you'll ever see me.

263
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:03,351
I won't come back,

264
00:24:03,451 --> 00:24:08,189
and you can go on with your life
without any interference from me.

265
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:12,084
It will be like l never existed, I promise.

266
00:24:15,505 --> 00:24:19,242
lf this is about my soul, take it.
l don't want it without you.

267
00:24:19,342 --> 00:24:21,637
It’s not about your soul.

268
00:24:24,514 --> 00:24:26,894
You're just not good for me.

269
00:24:28,435 --> 00:24:30,475
Not good enough for you.

270
00:24:31,646 --> 00:24:35,556
I’m just sorry l let this go on for so long.

271
00:24:36,151 --> 00:24:38,151
Please...

272
00:24:39,028 --> 00:24:41,028
Don't...

273
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,660
Goodbye.

274
00:25:02,594 --> 00:25:23,405
Edward.

275
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:28,409
Edward.

276
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,710
Edward.

277
00:27:32,535 --> 00:27:35,855
I’m gonna try the Cullen’s' place again.

278
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:39,025
The Cullen’s left town, Charlie.
- Good riddance.

279
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:41,125
Where'd they go?

280
00:27:41,836 --> 00:27:43,696
We'll find her, Charlie.

281
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:46,131
Thanks, Harry.
- Charlie.

282
00:27:46,382 --> 00:27:48,382
Hey.

283
00:27:50,762 --> 00:27:52,762
She's all right.

284
00:27:53,222 --> 00:27:56,725
I got her. Thank you, Sam.

285
00:29:06,629 --> 00:29:09,965
Alice, you've disappeared,

286
00:29:12,593 --> 00:29:14,593
like everything else.

287
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:19,120
Now who else can I talk to? I’m lost.

288
00:29:25,606 --> 00:29:27,606
When you left,

289
00:29:29,152 --> 00:29:31,152
and he left,

290
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,495
you took everything with you.

291
00:29:37,493 --> 00:29:41,233
But the absence of him
is everywhere I look.

292
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,765
It’s like a huge hole has been
punched through my chest.

293
00:29:57,054 --> 00:29:59,054
Bella.

294
00:30:14,363 --> 00:30:16,403
But in a way I’m glad.

295
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:20,061
The pain is my only reminder
that he was real,

296
00:30:20,161 --> 00:30:22,161
that you all were.

297
00:30:30,505 --> 00:30:32,631
All right. That's it.

298
00:30:35,384 --> 00:30:36,828
What?

299
00:30:36,928 --> 00:30:41,433
You're going to Jacksonville
to live with your mother.

300
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:44,598
I’m not leaving Forks.

301
00:30:45,895 --> 00:30:49,689
Bells, he's not coming back.

302
00:30:52,777 --> 00:30:54,777
I know.

303
00:30:55,238 --> 00:30:58,468
It’s just not normal, this behaviour.

304
00:30:58,741 --> 00:31:04,011
Quite frankly, it's scaring the
hell out of me and your mother.

305
00:31:04,247 --> 00:31:06,816
Baby, I don't want you to leave.

306
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:11,654
I don't, but just go. Go to Jacksonville.
Make some new friends.

307
00:31:11,754 --> 00:31:13,406
I like my old friends.

308
00:31:13,506 --> 00:31:16,906
Well, you never see them anymore.
- I do.

309
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:24,015
I’m gonna go shopping
tomorrow with Jessica.

310
00:31:25,893 --> 00:31:28,019
You hate shopping.
- I...

311
00:31:29,772 --> 00:31:31,982
I need a girls' night out.

312
00:31:34,735 --> 00:31:37,529
All right. Girls' night.

313
00:31:38,948 --> 00:31:40,948
Shopping.

314
00:31:41,075 --> 00:31:44,786
I like it. Go buy some stuff.

315
00:31:53,129 --> 00:31:55,169
Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.

316
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:58,382
Yeah, Bella Swan.

317
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:04,707
I don't know why you want to sit through...

318
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:08,044
...all those zombies eating people
and no hot guys kissing anybody.

319
00:32:08,144 --> 00:32:11,672
It’s gross. Like... And why are there
that many zombie movies anyway?

320
00:32:11,772 --> 00:32:14,342
'Cause if it's supposed to, like,
draw a parallel about leprosy,

321
00:32:14,442 --> 00:32:17,386
my cousin had leprosy.
It’s not funny, you know?

322
00:32:17,486 --> 00:32:20,389
And, like, is it supposed to be
a metaphor for consumerism?

323
00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:22,642
Because don't be so pleased
with your own, like,

324
00:32:22,742 --> 00:32:25,353
self-referential cleverness, you know?

325
00:32:25,453 --> 00:32:28,898
Like, some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.

326
00:32:28,998 --> 00:32:31,984
Although I was surprised
you even called at all. You know?

327
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:35,196
Like, your depression thing,
I get it. I’m totally, totally worried.

328
00:32:35,296 --> 00:32:36,280
But after a while it's like,

329
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,865
you're still bumming...
- You want a ride, girls?

330
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:39,909
...and I’m going through stuff, too.
You know? Like Mike deciding...

331
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:41,077
...he just wants to be friends.

332
00:32:41,177 --> 00:32:42,119
What's up? Look what we found.

333
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:43,412
It’s hard, you know?

334
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:44,789
Like, and since when does 'just friends'...

335
00:32:44,889 --> 00:32:46,415
What's up guys?
- Look what we found.

336
00:32:46,515 --> 00:32:49,830
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, where you going?

337
00:32:56,651 --> 00:32:58,651
Keep walking.

338
00:32:59,737 --> 00:33:01,737
This is dangerous.

339
00:33:10,831 --> 00:33:13,891
Dude, come on.
- Come here for a sec.

340
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,840
I think I know those guys.

341
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:22,759
We got beer. We got bikes.

342
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:26,107
Well, they seem great. Can we go?

343
00:33:26,722 --> 00:33:29,357
I’m just gonna see something.

344
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:32,142
Hey, girlie.

345
00:33:35,982 --> 00:33:39,127
All right, all right. We got a taker.

346
00:33:39,402 --> 00:33:41,402
Turn around.

347
00:33:55,584 --> 00:33:57,877
Shut up.
- You shut up.

348
00:34:04,218 --> 00:34:05,369
I’m sorry, I thought you
were somebody else.

349
00:34:05,469 --> 00:34:08,289
No, that's cool.
I’ll be whoever you want me to be, honey.

350
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:11,057
So, what do you say?

351
00:34:15,604 --> 00:34:18,494
You promised me, nothing reckless.

352
00:34:22,111 --> 00:34:26,191
You promised it would be
as if you never existed.

353
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,606
You lied.
- You say something, babe?

354
00:34:33,706 --> 00:34:35,916
You know what? Never mind.

355
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:54,976
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

356
00:35:04,987 --> 00:35:07,890
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?

357
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,990
Just curious.

358
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,397
l thought that l saw something.
- You... Oh.

359
00:35:14,497 --> 00:35:17,791
You're insane, actually. Or suicidal.

360
00:35:18,292 --> 00:35:21,352
That homeboy could've been a psycho.

361
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:25,533
I was about to end up in an FBI
interview room like some lame TV show.

362
00:35:25,633 --> 00:35:27,843
God, that was such a rush.

363
00:35:29,386 --> 00:35:31,914
Awesome. So you're an
adrenaline junkie now?

364
00:35:32,014 --> 00:35:33,249
That's cool. You can go bungee jumping.

365
00:35:33,349 --> 00:35:36,585
You don't get on the back
of some random loser's motorcycle.

366
00:35:36,685 --> 00:35:38,685
Crazy.

367
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:45,026
Alice, I saw him.

368
00:35:47,113 --> 00:35:50,768
Maybe I’m crazy now. I guess that's okay.

369
00:35:52,076 --> 00:35:55,312
If a rush of danger
is what it takes to see him,

370
00:35:55,412 --> 00:35:57,877
then that's what I’ll find.

371
00:36:01,752 --> 00:36:03,752
Bella.

372
00:36:04,004 --> 00:36:06,979
Where the hell have you been, loca?

373
00:36:10,136 --> 00:36:12,595
I brought you something.

374
00:36:13,264 --> 00:36:15,890
Okay.
- I t’s a little crazy.

375
00:36:20,938 --> 00:36:22,298
Wow.

376
00:36:22,398 --> 00:36:24,592
Scrap metal. You shouldn't have.

377
00:36:24,692 --> 00:36:27,157
I saved it from the junkyard.

378
00:36:29,155 --> 00:36:33,184
I think they'll probably cost more to fix
than they're worth,

379
00:36:33,284 --> 00:36:35,519
but then I thought that
if l had a mechanic friend...

380
00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:36,854
...to help me out then...
- Ah.

381
00:36:36,954 --> 00:36:41,119
Me being the mechanic-type friend?
- That's right.

382
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,580
Since when are you into motorcycles?
- Since now.

383
00:36:49,925 --> 00:36:53,788
I get it if you think that this
is really stupid and reckless.

384
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:58,053
Yeah, I mean, it's completely
stupid and reckless.

385
00:36:59,935 --> 00:37:01,935
When do we start?

386
00:37:03,814 --> 00:37:05,549
Um.

387
00:37:05,649 --> 00:37:07,649
Now.

388
00:37:07,776 --> 00:37:09,776
Please?
- All right.

389
00:37:12,072 --> 00:37:17,597
Oh, hey, be careful.
Those things are actually really heavy, so...

390
00:37:21,749 --> 00:37:24,000
Jake, you're, like, buff.

391
00:37:24,084 --> 00:37:26,320
How did that happen?
You're, like, 16. I don't get it.

392
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:31,775
Mmm-hmm. Age is just a number, baby.
What are you, like, 40 now?

393
00:37:34,094 --> 00:37:36,559
It feels like that sometimes.

394
00:37:46,607 --> 00:37:49,667
That song's good. You don't like it?

395
00:37:50,444 --> 00:37:54,822
I don't really like music anymore, kind of.

396
00:37:55,491 --> 00:37:57,992
Okay. No more music.

397
00:38:01,163 --> 00:38:03,232
So I was thinking, if we're
gonna do this every day,

398
00:38:03,332 --> 00:38:05,151
and hopefully we will,

399
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:07,945
we have to, like, fit some
homework in there somewhere.

400
00:38:08,045 --> 00:38:11,073
I don't want Billy thinking that
I’m a bad influence on you.

401
00:38:11,173 --> 00:38:14,300
You? Influence me? Please.

402
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:19,165
Are you... I’m older than you,

403
00:38:19,265 --> 00:38:22,585
so that makes me the influencer
and you the influencee.

404
00:38:22,685 --> 00:38:24,253
No, no, no.

405
00:38:24,353 --> 00:38:28,090
My size and knowledge base
actually makes me older than you...

406
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,676
...because of your general
paleness and lack of know-how.

407
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:33,262
I convinced you to build two-wheeled
death machines with me.

408
00:38:33,362 --> 00:38:36,891
Don't you think that makes
you kind of young and naive?

409
00:38:36,991 --> 00:38:39,286
Okay. So where do we stand?

410
00:38:40,202 --> 00:38:44,197
I’m 35. And you might be, like, 32.
- Come on.

411
00:38:44,373 --> 00:38:47,943
Yo, Jake, you in there?
- It’s okay. It’s just my boys.

412
00:38:48,043 --> 00:38:50,779
Hey, Jake.
- Hey. Guys, this is Bella.

413
00:38:50,879 --> 00:38:53,769
Bella, that's Quil and Embry.
- Hi.

414
00:38:54,091 --> 00:38:56,091
I’m Quil Ateara.

415
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,872
So the bike building story is true.

416
00:38:59,972 --> 00:39:02,041
Oh, yeah, yeah, I taught
him everything he knows.

417
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:05,461
What about the part
where you're his girlfriend?

418
00:39:05,561 --> 00:39:06,545
Uh...

419
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,464
We're friends, you know.

420
00:39:08,564 --> 00:39:10,174
Burn.
- Actually,

421
00:39:10,274 --> 00:39:13,135
remember I said she's a girl and a friend.

422
00:39:13,235 --> 00:39:15,095
Embry, do you remember him
making that distinction?

423
00:39:15,195 --> 00:39:16,138
Nope.

424
00:39:16,238 --> 00:39:19,978
So you guys have girlfriends?
That's awesome.

425
00:39:19,992 --> 00:39:24,063
Yeah, right. Quil's actually
taking his cousin to prom.

426
00:39:24,163 --> 00:39:25,314
Yeah, that's still a riot.

427
00:39:25,414 --> 00:39:29,154
You want funny, Black?
I’ll give you funny.

428
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,986
Jeez.

429
00:39:31,086 --> 00:39:32,404
Hey, that holds illegal.

430
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:34,629
I got five bucks on Quil.

431
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,840
You're on.

432
00:39:58,989 --> 00:40:00,224
Dear Alice,

433
00:40:00,324 --> 00:40:02,959
I wish I had your real address.

434
00:40:03,118 --> 00:40:05,854
I wish I could tell you about Jake.

435
00:40:05,954 --> 00:40:08,164
He makes me feel better.

436
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:11,968
I mean, he makes me feel alive.

437
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:16,464
The hole in my chest,

438
00:40:17,132 --> 00:40:22,062
well, when I’m with Jake,
it's like it's almost healed...

439
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:24,206
...for a while.

440
00:40:24,306 --> 00:40:29,044
So, Quil keeps asking to come over.
I think he likes you a little too much.

441
00:40:29,144 --> 00:40:30,921
Oh.

442
00:40:31,021 --> 00:40:36,121
Well, I’m really not into
the whole cougar thing. You know?

443
00:40:36,985 --> 00:40:39,280
What's up with you and age?

444
00:40:39,488 --> 00:40:43,143
I mean, how old was that
Cullen guy, anyway?

445
00:40:45,035 --> 00:40:48,520
But even Jake can't keep the dreams away.

446
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,630
Hey, hey, hey.

447
00:40:59,007 --> 00:41:00,159
Wake up, Bella.

448
00:41:00,259 --> 00:41:02,927
You're okay. You're okay.

449
00:41:14,022 --> 00:41:18,952
I thought this thing was starting
to work, but I guess not.

450
00:41:24,825 --> 00:41:26,868
Can I ask you something?

451
00:41:28,871 --> 00:41:30,871
Hanging out with Jacob,

452
00:41:31,707 --> 00:41:36,552
that seems to take your mind
off things a bit, doesn't it?

453
00:41:40,466 --> 00:41:42,466
You know, sometimes...

454
00:41:44,136 --> 00:41:48,131
...you gotta learn to
love what's good for you.

455
00:41:48,182 --> 00:41:50,182
You know what I mean?

456
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:54,729
Of course, what do I know?

457
00:41:54,938 --> 00:41:57,573
I’m just a terminal bachelor.

458
00:41:59,526 --> 00:42:01,527
Famous ladies' man.

459
00:42:04,072 --> 00:42:06,072
Okay.

460
00:42:07,075 --> 00:42:09,075
I’m gonna go to bed.

461
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:10,813
Uh...

462
00:42:10,913 --> 00:42:12,913
I love you.

463
00:42:18,462 --> 00:42:24,667
lf l told you l couldn't have fixed
these bikes, what would you have said?

464
00:42:25,427 --> 00:42:28,232
Are you doubting your mad skills?

465
00:42:28,514 --> 00:42:32,339
No. Definitely not. I mean, they'll run fine.

466
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:34,809
It’s just,

467
00:42:36,146 --> 00:42:41,586
maybe if I was smart, I would have
dragged out the rebuild a bit.

468
00:42:44,112 --> 00:42:49,101
If you told me you couldn't fix these bikes,
I would say that that's really too bad,

469
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:54,216
but that we're just gonna have
to find something else to do.

470
00:42:58,252 --> 00:43:00,252
Is that Sam Uley?

471
00:43:00,963 --> 00:43:03,339
Yeah. Him and his cult.

472
00:43:06,218 --> 00:43:08,218
Oh, my God.

473
00:43:10,764 --> 00:43:12,764
Did you see that?

474
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:22,050
They're not really fighting, Bella.
They're cliff diving.

475
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,870
Scary as hell, but a total rush.

476
00:43:27,948 --> 00:43:30,726
A rush?
- Most of us jump from lower down.

477
00:43:30,826 --> 00:43:34,991
We leave the showing off
to Sam and his disciples.

478
00:43:36,373 --> 00:43:40,453
You have some kind of beef
with him or something?

479
00:43:40,836 --> 00:43:42,321
l don't know.

480
00:43:42,421 --> 00:43:45,324
They just think they run this place.

481
00:43:45,424 --> 00:43:48,285
Embry used to call them
hall monitors on steroids.

482
00:43:48,385 --> 00:43:51,020
Now look at him.
- That's Embry?

483
00:43:52,681 --> 00:43:55,061
Yeah.
- What happened to him?

484
00:43:55,517 --> 00:43:57,044
He missed some school.

485
00:43:57,144 --> 00:44:01,215
Now all of a sudden, he started following
Sam around like a little puppy.

486
00:44:01,315 --> 00:44:04,510
Same thing happened with Paul and Jared.

487
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:07,160
Sam keeps giving me this look,

488
00:44:08,989 --> 00:44:12,219
like he's waiting for me or something.

489
00:44:12,993 --> 00:44:15,687
It’s kind of starting to freak me out.

490
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:18,507
Well, you should just avoid him.

491
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:22,208
I try.

492
00:44:38,685 --> 00:44:40,685
Okay.

493
00:44:43,106 --> 00:44:45,486
You look scared.
- I’m not.

494
00:44:46,693 --> 00:44:47,970
All right.

495
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:50,071
Brake?
- That one.

496
00:44:53,408 --> 00:44:54,768
Clutch?

497
00:44:54,868 --> 00:44:56,311
Good.

498
00:44:56,411 --> 00:44:58,411
Gas?

499
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,040
Ready?

500
00:45:02,417 --> 00:45:05,503
Now, slowly release the clutch.

501
00:45:07,506 --> 00:45:09,506
Bella.

502
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,260
Stop.

503
00:45:15,138 --> 00:45:17,138
Whoa.

504
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,600
You all right?

505
00:45:21,478 --> 00:45:23,478
I’m gonna go again.

506
00:45:23,689 --> 00:45:25,689
Okay.

507
00:45:38,453 --> 00:45:40,453
Ah.

508
00:45:40,914 --> 00:45:42,914
Whoa.

509
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:45,625
Hit the brake.

510
00:45:59,725 --> 00:46:00,709
I wanna go again.

511
00:46:00,809 --> 00:46:02,544
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

512
00:46:02,644 --> 00:46:05,959
No. l want to go again.
- No. Forget it.

513
00:46:05,981 --> 00:46:07,981
No more bikes.

514
00:46:08,567 --> 00:46:10,567
Man, your head.

515
00:46:10,777 --> 00:46:12,777
Ow.

516
00:46:13,196 --> 00:46:15,831
Yeah.
- Oh, my God, I’m sorry.

517
00:46:16,658 --> 00:46:19,888
What, you're apologizing for bleeding?

518
00:46:21,496 --> 00:46:23,496
Yeah. I guess I am.

519
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:27,736
Well, it's just blood, Bella. No big deal.

520
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,340
There.

521
00:46:40,182 --> 00:46:42,224
What are you staring at?

522
00:46:45,604 --> 00:46:47,730
You're sort of beautiful.

523
00:46:55,614 --> 00:46:58,249
How hard did you hit your head?

524
00:46:59,409 --> 00:47:01,409
I don't know.

525
00:47:02,829 --> 00:47:04,829
Let's go.

526
00:47:07,667 --> 00:47:09,569
I did see something in the woods.

527
00:47:09,669 --> 00:47:11,029
Totally. Baby, l believe you.

528
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:14,741
No, he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.

529
00:47:14,841 --> 00:47:18,844
No, okay. It was jet black and huge.

530
00:47:18,929 --> 00:47:21,748
On all fours, it was still taller than a person.

531
00:47:21,848 --> 00:47:22,999
A bear, maybe?

532
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:26,878
Or an alien.
You're lucky you didn't get probed.

533
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:28,979
Well, I saw it.

534
00:47:29,731 --> 00:47:32,467
You know, you're not the only one.

535
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:35,178
My dad's been getting
reports at the station.

536
00:47:35,278 --> 00:47:38,181
Like, five hikers have been killed
by some bear.

537
00:47:38,281 --> 00:47:40,392
But they can't find the bear.

538
00:47:40,492 --> 00:47:42,492
Hmm.

539
00:47:43,578 --> 00:47:47,063
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.

540
00:47:47,207 --> 00:47:49,207
Um...

541
00:47:50,585 --> 00:47:52,585
So? I mean,

542
00:47:52,879 --> 00:47:54,879
Bella's back?

543
00:47:58,301 --> 00:47:59,870
Yeah, I guess so.

544
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:02,945
All right, that's... Well, welcome.

545
00:48:03,557 --> 00:48:06,787
So, listen, now that you're talking...

546
00:48:08,186 --> 00:48:14,731
...and eating again, which, you know,
you've got to get that protein in there,

547
00:48:14,943 --> 00:48:20,043
I was just wondering if you
wanted to go see a movie with me.

548
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:25,828
Yeah. Sure. Yeah, l do.

549
00:48:27,706 --> 00:48:28,940
Cool.

550
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,845
Let me see, we could check out...

551
00:48:32,127 --> 00:48:34,362
'Love Spelled Backwards Is Love'.

552
00:48:34,462 --> 00:48:37,532
You know, it's a dumb title,
but it's a romantic comedy.

553
00:48:37,632 --> 00:48:42,222
I mean, it's supposed to be pretty...
- No. No romance.

554
00:48:44,556 --> 00:48:48,466
How about 'Face Punch'?
Have you heard of that?

555
00:48:48,476 --> 00:48:50,879
I mean, that's an action movie.

556
00:48:50,979 --> 00:48:52,979
Yeah, that's perfect.

557
00:48:53,648 --> 00:48:55,648
Guns, adrenaline.

558
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:57,552
That's my thing.

559
00:48:57,652 --> 00:48:59,054
Okay.

560
00:48:59,154 --> 00:49:03,475
We should get a bunch of people to go.
Do you guys want to go see 'Face Punch'?

561
00:49:03,575 --> 00:49:04,768
'Face Punch', yeah.

562
00:49:04,868 --> 00:49:06,353
Mike, hey, we were supposed to watch that.

563
00:49:06,453 --> 00:49:07,979
Remember, the trailer's like...

564
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,273
'Punch faces.'
- I remember.

565
00:49:10,373 --> 00:49:13,083
Yeah. Movie night with Bella.

566
00:49:16,338 --> 00:49:18,338
So 'Face Punch', huh?

567
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,841
You like action movies?

568
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,760
Not really.

569
00:49:26,222 --> 00:49:29,016
I heard it sucks. Bad.

570
00:49:30,518 --> 00:49:34,088
Are you even old enough to see this movie?

571
00:49:34,356 --> 00:49:36,091
I mean, you know, without,
like, adult supervision.

572
00:49:36,191 --> 00:49:38,093
Right, yeah, well, she's
buying my ticket for me.

573
00:49:38,193 --> 00:49:40,193
She's buying it. Okay.

574
00:49:41,237 --> 00:49:44,182
Jessica bailed, and Angela
got the stomach flu,

575
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:46,747
so Eric's taking care of her.

576
00:49:47,535 --> 00:49:50,000
It’s just us three.
- Great.

577
00:49:50,789 --> 00:49:52,789
Great.
- Yeah.

578
00:49:55,502 --> 00:49:56,778
Put your gun down.

579
00:49:56,878 --> 00:49:59,573
Put your gun down or I’m gonna
blow your frickin' head off.

580
00:49:59,673 --> 00:50:02,117
Both of you put both of your guns down...

581
00:50:02,217 --> 00:50:06,246
...or I’m gonna blow both
of your frickin' heads off.

582
00:50:06,346 --> 00:50:09,321
All right, forget it,
let's do this.

583
00:50:26,241 --> 00:50:29,216
Okay, I think I’m gonna throw up.

584
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:36,526
He's...

585
00:50:36,626 --> 00:50:38,626
What a marshmallow.

586
00:50:39,587 --> 00:50:42,991
You should hold out for someone
with a stronger stomach.

587
00:50:43,091 --> 00:50:46,536
Someone who laughs at the gore
that makes weaker men vomit.

588
00:50:46,636 --> 00:50:49,951
Yeah. I’ll keep my eye open for that.

589
00:50:50,765 --> 00:50:55,525
I feel bad. He probably has
that flu that's going around.

590
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,759
What? I can't hold your hand?

591
00:51:00,859 --> 00:51:02,901
No, of course you can.

592
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:11,853
I just think it means, you know, something
a little different to you. So...

593
00:51:11,953 --> 00:51:16,118
Okay, well, tell me something.
You like me, right?

594
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:23,441
And you think I’m sort of beautiful?

595
00:51:23,965 --> 00:51:27,593
Jacob, please, don't do this.

596
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:36,350
Why?

597
00:51:38,897 --> 00:51:42,297
Because you're about to ruin everything.

598
00:51:43,526 --> 00:51:46,153
And I need you.

599
00:51:53,078 --> 00:51:55,713
Well, I’ve got loads of time.

600
00:51:56,664 --> 00:51:58,704
I’m not gonna give up.

601
00:51:59,709 --> 00:52:02,336
I don't want you to,

602
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:09,009
but it's just 'cause I don't
want you to go anywhere.

603
00:52:10,345 --> 00:52:12,596
And that's really selfish.

604
00:52:16,101 --> 00:52:20,351
You know, I’m not like a
car that you can fix up.

605
00:52:23,483 --> 00:52:28,158
I’m never gonna run right.
So I should be fair to you.

606
00:52:29,948 --> 00:52:32,413
It’s because of him, right?

607
00:52:42,502 --> 00:52:44,502
Look,

608
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,798
I know what he did to you.

609
00:52:49,175 --> 00:52:53,387
But, Bella, l would never ever do that.

610
00:52:56,099 --> 00:52:59,309
I won't ever hurt you. l promise.

611
00:53:00,812 --> 00:53:02,812
I won't let you down.

612
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,690
You can count on me.

613
00:53:13,408 --> 00:53:15,408
Well,

614
00:53:19,831 --> 00:53:21,831
I need to go home.

615
00:53:28,715 --> 00:53:32,285
I was feeling sick before the movie. Okay?

616
00:53:34,804 --> 00:53:36,122
What is your problem?

617
00:53:36,222 --> 00:53:38,687
Right now? You're my problem.

618
00:53:39,142 --> 00:53:43,392
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.

619
00:53:43,605 --> 00:53:45,423
You want me to put you in the hospital?

620
00:53:45,523 --> 00:53:49,177
Jake. Jake. Jake, the movie's over.
What are you doing?

621
00:53:49,277 --> 00:53:51,904
You're really hot.

622
00:53:53,448 --> 00:53:57,698
Like, you feel like you have a fever.
Are you okay?

623
00:53:57,744 --> 00:54:00,294
I don't know what's happening.

624
00:54:01,998 --> 00:54:03,998
I gotta go.

625
00:54:08,588 --> 00:54:10,588
That dude is weird.

626
00:54:13,801 --> 00:54:16,691
Jake, your dad says you have mono.

627
00:54:17,055 --> 00:54:20,795
He won't let me visit,
but would you call me?

628
00:54:25,772 --> 00:54:28,398
Hey, it's me again. I just...

629
00:54:29,442 --> 00:54:33,346
I’m sorry about what I said
at the movie theatre.

630
00:54:33,446 --> 00:54:37,526
I just wanted to hear your
voice, so no pressure.

631
00:54:39,786 --> 00:54:41,786
Jacob, please...

632
00:54:43,164 --> 00:54:44,524
Call me.

633
00:54:44,624 --> 00:54:47,684
Okay. We should be back around 3:00.

634
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,300
Hey.

635
00:54:56,386 --> 00:54:58,371
Look, l don't have to go fishing today.

636
00:54:58,471 --> 00:55:00,165
Yes, you do.

637
00:55:00,265 --> 00:55:02,876
Yeah, you do. Go.
What are you talking about?

638
00:55:02,976 --> 00:55:04,627
Just be careful.

639
00:55:04,727 --> 00:55:06,727
Always am.

640
00:55:07,855 --> 00:55:10,341
Those bears won't get
the drop on me, Bella.

641
00:55:10,441 --> 00:55:12,442
My Kung Fu is strong.

642
00:55:45,685 --> 00:55:47,685
Jake.

643
00:55:47,854 --> 00:55:49,854
Hey.

644
00:55:53,943 --> 00:55:55,943
You cut your hair off?

645
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,740
And got a tattoo?

646
00:56:03,911 --> 00:56:05,104
Bella.

647
00:56:05,204 --> 00:56:08,983
l thought you were too
sick to come outside...

648
00:56:09,083 --> 00:56:12,143
...or pick up the phone when l call.

649
00:56:13,046 --> 00:56:15,046
Go away.

650
00:56:15,715 --> 00:56:17,715
What?

651
00:56:18,551 --> 00:56:20,551
Go away.

652
00:56:21,846 --> 00:56:23,998
What happened to you? What's...

653
00:56:24,098 --> 00:56:26,391
Hey. What happened?

654
00:56:29,354 --> 00:56:32,382
Did Sam get to you?
Is that what's happening?

655
00:56:32,482 --> 00:56:35,967
Sam's trying to help me. Don't blame him.

656
00:56:36,903 --> 00:56:39,430
But if you want somebody to blame,

657
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:44,375
how about those filthy bloodsuckers
you love, the Cullen’s?

658
00:56:50,666 --> 00:56:51,776
l don't know what you're talking about.

659
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:54,570
No, you know exactly
what I’m talking about.

660
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:57,985
You've been lying to everyone. Charlie.

661
00:56:59,759 --> 00:57:01,802
But you can't lie to me.

662
00:57:02,887 --> 00:57:05,182
Not anymore, Bella.
- Jacob.

663
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:07,723
Jacob.

664
00:57:13,106 --> 00:57:15,106
Look, Bella,

665
00:57:15,817 --> 00:57:18,197
we can't be friends anymore.

666
00:57:19,028 --> 00:57:23,023
Look, Jake, l know that
I’ve been hurting you.

667
00:57:24,492 --> 00:57:27,494
It’s killing me. It kills me.

668
00:57:29,789 --> 00:57:32,567
l just need... Maybe give me, like,

669
00:57:32,667 --> 00:57:35,528
some time or something.
- Look, don't.

670
00:57:35,628 --> 00:57:37,628
It’s not you.

671
00:57:40,049 --> 00:57:43,364
It’s not you, it's me, right? Really?

672
00:57:43,886 --> 00:57:46,221
It’s true. It is me.

673
00:57:49,183 --> 00:57:51,309
I’m not good.

674
00:57:54,105 --> 00:57:57,315
l used to be a good kid.

675
00:57:58,651 --> 00:58:00,651
Not anymore.

676
00:58:01,195 --> 00:58:04,015
This doesn't even matter. All right?

677
00:58:04,115 --> 00:58:05,099
This is over.

678
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:07,494
You can't break up with me.

679
00:58:09,287 --> 00:58:11,287
l mean...

680
00:58:11,956 --> 00:58:14,761
...l mean, you're my best friend.

681
00:58:16,711 --> 00:58:18,711
You promised me.

682
00:58:19,922 --> 00:58:21,922
l know.

683
00:58:22,091 --> 00:58:25,321
l promised l wouldn't hurt you, Bella,

684
00:58:25,678 --> 00:58:28,738
and this is me keeping that promise.

685
00:58:29,015 --> 00:58:31,015
Go home...

686
00:58:31,058 --> 00:58:35,053
...and don't come back
or you're gonna get hurt.

687
00:58:48,034 --> 00:58:50,034
Alice,

688
00:58:50,411 --> 00:58:52,411
things are...

689
00:58:53,539 --> 00:58:55,539
Things are bad again.

690
00:58:56,626 --> 00:59:00,111
Without Jake, l just... l can't stand it.

691
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:05,385
l don't see Edward anymore.

692
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:10,414
Will it really feel like he never existed?

693
00:59:17,271 --> 00:59:21,266
l will find the place
where l can see him again.

694
01:00:15,705 --> 01:00:17,705
Bella.

695
01:00:17,957 --> 01:00:19,957
Laurent.

696
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:24,015
l didn't expect to find you here.

697
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:30,176
l went to visit the Cullen’s,
but the house is empty.

698
01:00:32,513 --> 01:00:35,124
I’m surprised they left you behind.

699
01:00:35,224 --> 01:00:37,225
Weren't you sort of...

700
01:00:38,352 --> 01:00:40,352
...a pet of theirs?

701
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:42,465
Yeah. You could say that.

702
01:00:42,565 --> 01:00:44,899
Do the Cullen’s visit often?

703
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:52,114
Lie.

704
01:00:56,704 --> 01:00:57,980
Yeah, absolutely, all the time.

705
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,607
Lie better.

706
01:00:59,707 --> 01:01:02,852
I’ll tell them that you stopped by.

707
01:01:02,918 --> 01:01:05,213
But l probably shouldn't...

708
01:01:05,588 --> 01:01:08,256
...tell Edward,

709
01:01:10,051 --> 01:01:11,410
'cause he's pretty protective.

710
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,890
But he's far away, isn't he?

711
01:01:16,599 --> 01:01:18,334
Why are you here?

712
01:01:18,434 --> 01:01:22,812
I came as a favour to Victoria.

713
01:01:26,275 --> 01:01:27,802
Victoria?
- She asked me to see...

714
01:01:27,902 --> 01:01:31,472
...if you were still under
the protection of the Cullen’s.

715
01:01:31,572 --> 01:01:35,434
Victoria feels it's only fair
to kill Edward's mate,

716
01:01:35,534 --> 01:01:37,186
given he killed hers.

717
01:01:37,286 --> 01:01:39,286
An eye for an eye.

718
01:01:39,747 --> 01:01:40,898
Threaten him.

719
01:01:40,998 --> 01:01:45,503
Edward would know who did it.
And he'd come after you.

720
01:01:45,544 --> 01:01:47,544
l don't think he will.

721
01:01:48,673 --> 01:01:51,993
After all, how much
could you mean to him...

722
01:01:52,093 --> 01:01:55,068
...if he left you here unprotected?

723
01:01:56,931 --> 01:01:59,917
Victoria won't be happy
about my killing you,

724
01:02:00,017 --> 01:02:02,057
but l can't help myself.

725
01:02:02,311 --> 01:02:04,046
You are so mouth-watering.

726
01:02:04,146 --> 01:02:08,736
Please, don't. l mean, you helped us.
- No, no, no, no.

727
01:02:09,068 --> 01:02:12,513
Don't be afraid. I’m doing you a kindness.

728
01:02:12,613 --> 01:02:15,758
Victoria plans on killing you slowly,

729
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:18,575
painfully,

730
01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:21,334
whereas I’ll make it quick.

731
01:02:21,455 --> 01:02:23,455
l promise.

732
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:25,834
You will feel nothing.

733
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,590
Edward, l love you.

734
01:02:35,594 --> 01:02:37,594
l don't believe it.

735
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:46,857
Dad. l saw them.
- What's the matter?

736
01:03:46,957 --> 01:03:49,944
In the woods. They're not bears.
- What do you mean 'in the woods'?

737
01:03:50,044 --> 01:03:51,779
Bell, what the hell were you
doing out in the woods?

738
01:03:51,879 --> 01:03:55,574
They're wolves.
l mean, they're like huge wolves.

739
01:03:55,674 --> 01:03:57,493
Are you sure about that, Bella?

740
01:03:57,593 --> 01:04:01,673
Yeah. l just saw them.
They were after something.

741
01:04:02,014 --> 01:04:04,014
Wolves?

742
01:04:04,391 --> 01:04:06,391
You saw them?

743
01:04:08,521 --> 01:04:11,064
All right, well, Harry,

744
01:04:12,358 --> 01:04:16,053
feel like going hunting?
Get some of your guys together?

745
01:04:16,153 --> 01:04:18,363
Sure, yeah, I’ll just...

746
01:04:19,949 --> 01:04:22,839
By now, those wolves will be dead,

747
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:26,439
and Laurent would have
told her I’m unprotected.

748
01:04:26,539 --> 01:04:28,539
Victoria.

749
01:04:29,542 --> 01:04:30,985
l should go to the station.

750
01:04:31,085 --> 01:04:33,805
Yeah, you should. You should go.

751
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:36,806
Can you just stay in the house?

752
01:05:01,574 --> 01:05:03,574
Bella.

753
01:05:05,494 --> 01:05:06,896
You scared me.

754
01:05:06,996 --> 01:05:11,671
What the hell are you doing?
- Back up. I’m coming up.

755
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,720
Hey.

756
01:05:26,098 --> 01:05:28,098
Look, I’m sorry.

757
01:05:34,857 --> 01:05:37,134
For what?
- l wish l could explain.

758
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:40,361
But l literally can't.

759
01:05:49,121 --> 01:05:53,317
Have you ever had a secret
you couldn't tell anyone,

760
01:05:53,417 --> 01:05:56,052
one that wasn't yours to share?

761
01:05:58,797 --> 01:06:01,492
Well, that's what it's like for me.

762
01:06:01,592 --> 01:06:03,592
But worse.

763
01:06:04,303 --> 01:06:07,680
You have no idea how tight I’m bound.

764
01:06:08,849 --> 01:06:10,849
l hate this.

765
01:06:11,226 --> 01:06:13,946
l hate what they've done to you.

766
01:06:27,701 --> 01:06:31,526
l mean, the killer part is, you already know.

767
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:40,060
Bella, do you remember when we
walked on the beach at La Push?

768
01:06:41,131 --> 01:06:43,131
The...

769
01:06:46,428 --> 01:06:49,097
The story. The story about...

770
01:06:50,391 --> 01:06:52,391
...the cold ones.

771
01:06:53,769 --> 01:06:58,699
l guess l understand why that's
the only part you remember.

772
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:08,366
There's gotta be something
that you can do.

773
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:10,575
No. I’m in it for life.

774
01:07:11,912 --> 01:07:14,523
Well, maybe we should just
get out of here for a while.

775
01:07:14,623 --> 01:07:16,483
Just leave,

776
01:07:16,583 --> 01:07:18,583
just you and me.

777
01:07:18,627 --> 01:07:20,627
You'd do that?

778
01:07:23,382 --> 01:07:25,382
l would do it for you.

779
01:07:31,598 --> 01:07:35,836
It’s not something l can
just run away from, Bella.

780
01:07:35,936 --> 01:07:39,439
But l would run away with you...

781
01:07:43,694 --> 01:07:45,694
...if l could.

782
01:07:49,241 --> 01:07:53,151
l gotta go.
They'll start wondering where l am.

783
01:07:56,623 --> 01:07:58,623
Come here.

784
01:08:02,379 --> 01:08:04,379
Please,

785
01:08:04,715 --> 01:08:06,715
try to remember.

786
01:08:08,135 --> 01:08:10,261
It'd be so much easier...

787
01:08:11,472 --> 01:08:13,472
...if you knew.

788
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:18,102
I’ll try. But, Jake...

789
01:08:18,896 --> 01:08:22,041
Jake, what are you doing? Wait, Jake.

790
01:08:28,781 --> 01:08:30,781
Jake.

791
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,840
Edward, I’m scared.

792
01:08:49,176 --> 01:08:51,176
You should be.

793
01:08:55,849 --> 01:08:57,751
Really, it's just like an old story.

794
01:08:57,851 --> 01:08:59,712
I’m not really supposed
to say anything about it.

795
01:08:59,812 --> 01:09:04,827
Did you know Quileutes are
supposedly descended from wolves?

796
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:20,024
Bella?

797
01:09:20,124 --> 01:09:22,124
l need to see him.

798
01:09:22,584 --> 01:09:24,584
He's not in.

799
01:09:25,796 --> 01:09:30,216
Okay, I’m sorry, l really need to see him.
- Bella.

800
01:09:45,065 --> 01:09:47,065
What did you do?

801
01:09:47,734 --> 01:09:48,761
Okay, what did you do?
- Hey.

802
01:09:48,861 --> 01:09:50,220
What did you do to him?
- Easy.

803
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,346
He didn't want this.

804
01:09:51,446 --> 01:09:53,807
What did we do? What did he do?
What'd he tell you?

805
01:09:53,907 --> 01:09:55,309
Both of you calm down.
- Nothing.

806
01:09:55,409 --> 01:09:59,319
He tells me nothing because
he's scared of you.

807
01:10:03,625 --> 01:10:06,260
Too late now.
- Bella, get back.

808
01:10:06,753 --> 01:10:09,463
Paul, calm down, now.

809
01:10:18,098 --> 01:10:20,098
Bella.

810
01:10:20,601 --> 01:10:22,601
Run.

811
01:10:24,938 --> 01:10:26,938
Jake, run.

812
01:10:52,466 --> 01:10:54,466
Paul.

813
01:11:04,311 --> 01:11:07,541
Hey. Take Bella back to Emily's place.

814
01:11:08,649 --> 01:11:11,369
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.

815
01:11:16,073 --> 01:11:19,983
Alice, is it possible that everything is true?

816
01:11:20,661 --> 01:11:23,021
The fairy tales and horror stories?

817
01:11:23,121 --> 01:11:28,391
Is it possible that there isn't
anything sane or normal at all?

818
01:11:28,835 --> 01:11:30,737
Hey, l think we should go back
and see if Jacob's okay.

819
01:11:30,837 --> 01:11:33,448
l hope Paul sinks some teeth in him.
Serves him right.

820
01:11:33,548 --> 01:11:35,325
No way. Jacob's a natural.

821
01:11:35,425 --> 01:11:39,121
You see him phase on the fly?
l got five says Paul doesn't touch him.

822
01:11:39,221 --> 01:11:41,915
Come on in, Bella. We won't bite.

823
01:11:42,015 --> 01:11:44,015
Speak for yourself.

824
01:11:53,527 --> 01:11:58,797
Oh, hey, about Emily, Sam's fiancée?
Don't stare. It bugs Sam.

825
01:12:00,742 --> 01:12:02,436
Why would l stare?

826
01:12:02,536 --> 01:12:05,936
Are you guys hungry? Like l have to ask.

827
01:12:13,046 --> 01:12:14,615
Who's this?

828
01:12:14,715 --> 01:12:16,715
Bella Swan. Who else?

829
01:12:18,218 --> 01:12:19,244
Hmm.

830
01:12:19,344 --> 01:12:21,724
So, you're the vampire girl.

831
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:26,766
So, you're the wolf girl.

832
01:12:29,563 --> 01:12:30,964
Guess so.

833
01:12:31,064 --> 01:12:33,649
Well, I’m engaged to one.

834
01:12:36,987 --> 01:12:41,532
Save some for your brothers.
And ladies first. Muffin?

835
01:12:42,576 --> 01:12:44,019
Sure. Thanks.

836
01:12:44,119 --> 01:12:48,315
Leave it to Jacob to find a
way around Sam's gag order.

837
01:12:48,415 --> 01:12:50,317
He didn't say anything to me.

838
01:12:50,417 --> 01:12:51,568
That's a wolf thing.

839
01:12:51,668 --> 01:12:54,154
Alpha's orders get obeyed
whether we want them to or not.

840
01:12:54,254 --> 01:12:56,490
And check it out.
We can hear each other's thoughts.

841
01:12:56,590 --> 01:13:00,661
Would you shut up?
These are trade secrets. Damn it.

842
01:13:00,761 --> 01:13:03,311
This chick runs with vampires.

843
01:13:04,097 --> 01:13:07,072
You can't really run with vampires.

844
01:13:08,643 --> 01:13:10,643
'Cause they're fast.

845
01:13:10,771 --> 01:13:13,522
Yeah? Well, we're faster.

846
01:13:14,941 --> 01:13:16,941
Freaked out yet?

847
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,681
You're not the first monsters I’ve met.

848
01:13:20,781 --> 01:13:23,926
Jake's right. You're good with weird.

849
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:27,410
Hey.

850
01:13:45,972 --> 01:13:47,972
Sorry.

851
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:03,780
So you're a werewolf?

852
01:14:05,450 --> 01:14:07,827
Yeah. Last time l checked.

853
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,400
A few lucky members of
the tribe have the gene.

854
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:17,835
A bloodsucker moves into
town and the fever sets in.

855
01:14:19,923 --> 01:14:21,923
Mono.

856
01:14:22,759 --> 01:14:24,759
Yeah. l wish.

857
01:14:27,556 --> 01:14:31,642
Well, can't you find a way to just stop?

858
01:14:34,187 --> 01:14:36,188
l mean, it's wrong.

859
01:14:38,775 --> 01:14:41,636
It’s not a lifestyle choice, Bella.

860
01:14:41,736 --> 01:14:44,431
l was born this way. l can't help it.

861
01:14:44,531 --> 01:14:45,531
You're such a hypocrite.

862
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:47,684
What, I’m not the right
kind of monster for you?

863
01:14:47,784 --> 01:14:49,824
It’s not what you are.

864
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:53,860
It’s what you do. They never hurt anybody.

865
01:14:55,917 --> 01:14:57,319
You've killed people, Jake.

866
01:14:57,419 --> 01:15:00,139
Bella, we're not killing anyone.

867
01:15:01,882 --> 01:15:03,283
Then who is?

868
01:15:03,383 --> 01:15:06,495
What we're trying to
protect you people from,

869
01:15:06,595 --> 01:15:08,805
the only thing we do kill,

870
01:15:11,099 --> 01:15:13,099
vampires.

871
01:15:13,894 --> 01:15:14,961
Wait, Jake, you can't.

872
01:15:15,061 --> 01:15:17,297
Don't worry. We can't touch
your little precious Cullen’s...

873
01:15:17,397 --> 01:15:20,287
...unless they violate the treaty.

874
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,761
That's not what I’m saying.

875
01:15:22,861 --> 01:15:25,836
You can't kill vampires. They'll...

876
01:15:25,906 --> 01:15:27,641
They'll kill you.

877
01:15:27,741 --> 01:15:32,671
Really? We took out that leech
with the dreads easy enough.

878
01:15:35,582 --> 01:15:36,691
Laurent?

879
01:15:36,791 --> 01:15:39,820
And his red-headed girlfriend is next.

880
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,279
Victoria's here?

881
01:15:41,379 --> 01:15:44,366
Was. We chased her all the way to the
Canadian border the other night.

882
01:15:44,466 --> 01:15:47,869
She keeps coming back.
We don't know what she's after.

883
01:15:47,969 --> 01:15:49,969
l do.

884
01:15:52,682 --> 01:15:54,682
Me.

885
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:06,346
Don't worry. We've got this place covered.

886
01:16:06,446 --> 01:16:09,336
She won't get near you or Charlie.

887
01:16:09,449 --> 01:16:11,184
Look, you've got to be careful.

888
01:16:11,284 --> 01:16:14,354
She's fast. You don't know how fast she is.

889
01:16:14,454 --> 01:16:19,639
You know, your lack of confidence
in us is a little insulting.

890
01:16:19,834 --> 01:16:22,129
All right, I’d better go.

891
01:16:23,088 --> 01:16:25,088
You gotta go?

892
01:16:25,549 --> 01:16:27,367
Yeah.

893
01:16:27,467 --> 01:16:29,593
Got a vampire to kill.

894
01:16:43,233 --> 01:16:45,776
Alice, I’m all right.

895
01:16:47,445 --> 01:16:49,445
Until I’m alone.

896
01:16:50,490 --> 01:16:53,210
And lately, that's all the time.

897
01:16:53,368 --> 01:16:56,062
Jacob's gone. He's hunting Victoria.

898
01:16:56,162 --> 01:16:58,398
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.

899
01:16:58,498 --> 01:17:00,498
And you're gone.

900
01:17:01,167 --> 01:17:03,167
And so is Edward.

901
01:17:06,923 --> 01:17:09,388
And there's just nothing now.

902
01:17:12,345 --> 01:17:14,470
You got something, Harry?

903
01:17:15,557 --> 01:17:17,557
Nope. Nothing.

904
01:17:24,858 --> 01:17:26,760
But l realize where l have to go,

905
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:29,835
what l have to do to see him again.

906
01:17:41,207 --> 01:17:43,751
♫ A tear in my brain ♫...

907
01:17:49,215 --> 01:17:52,843
...♫ Allows the voices in ♫...

908
01:17:59,225 --> 01:18:03,135
...♫ They wanna push you off the path ♫...

909
01:18:07,275 --> 01:18:10,778
...♫ With their frequency wires ♫...

910
01:18:18,203 --> 01:18:21,914
...♫ And you can do no wrong ♫...

911
01:18:28,213 --> 01:18:34,760
...♫ In my eyes ♫...

912
01:18:36,971 --> 01:18:40,474
...♫ You can do no wrong ♫...

913
01:18:46,731 --> 01:18:53,445
...♫ In my eyes ♫...

914
01:18:55,407 --> 01:18:57,434
...♫ A drunken salesman ♫...

915
01:18:57,534 --> 01:18:59,436
...♫ Your hearing damage ♫...

916
01:18:59,536 --> 01:19:01,396
...♫ Your mind is restless ♫...

917
01:19:01,496 --> 01:19:03,565
...♫ They say you're getting better ♫...

918
01:19:03,665 --> 01:19:07,320
...♫ But you don't feel any better ♫...

919
01:19:14,008 --> 01:19:16,036
...♫ Your speakers are blowing ♫...

920
01:19:16,136 --> 01:19:18,204
...♫ Your ears are wrecking ♫...

921
01:19:18,304 --> 01:19:20,206
...♫ Your hearing damage ♫...

922
01:19:20,306 --> 01:19:24,810
...♫ You wish you felt better ♫...

923
01:19:32,902 --> 01:19:36,655
...♫ You can do no wrong ♫...

924
01:19:42,829 --> 01:19:52,838
...♫ In my eyes ♫

925
01:20:27,373 --> 01:20:29,373
Don't do this.

926
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:36,090
You wanted me to be human.

927
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:40,510
Watch me.

928
01:20:42,597 --> 01:20:44,597
Please.

929
01:20:45,183 --> 01:20:46,167
For me.

930
01:20:46,267 --> 01:20:49,412
You won't stay with me any other way.

931
01:20:51,648 --> 01:20:53,648
Bella, please.

932
01:21:56,045 --> 01:22:02,467
♫ This constant noise all the time ♫...

933
01:22:12,937 --> 01:22:18,817
...♫ Even though you're
the only one l see ♫

934
01:22:21,779 --> 01:22:23,779
Breathe.

935
01:22:24,782 --> 01:22:26,782
Breathe.

936
01:22:27,493 --> 01:22:29,536
Come on, Bella, breathe.

937
01:22:36,628 --> 01:22:39,254
Bella? Bella, can you hear me?

938
01:22:45,595 --> 01:22:47,595
Jake?

939
01:22:48,389 --> 01:22:50,389
Come here.

940
01:22:55,188 --> 01:22:57,908
What the hell were you thinking?

941
01:22:58,691 --> 01:23:01,326
l just wanted to see something.

942
01:23:01,361 --> 01:23:06,376
Get her home. I’m gonna go help
out over at Harry's place.

943
01:23:08,076 --> 01:23:10,201
What happened at Harry's?

944
01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:13,430
Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.

945
01:23:13,706 --> 01:23:16,276
Charlie and my dad are over
at his place with his family.

946
01:23:16,376 --> 01:23:18,376
Is he okay?

947
01:23:20,046 --> 01:23:22,046
He's gone.

948
01:23:25,093 --> 01:23:29,853
Come on. I’ll get you something
dry and drive you home.

949
01:23:39,816 --> 01:23:42,401
108 degrees over here.

950
01:23:44,278 --> 01:23:46,278
God.

951
01:23:46,614 --> 01:23:48,614
My hands are freezing.

952
01:23:50,702 --> 01:23:53,479
It must be nice, never getting cold.

953
01:23:53,579 --> 01:23:55,579
It’s a wolf thing.

954
01:23:56,082 --> 01:23:58,082
It’s not.

955
01:23:58,084 --> 01:24:00,084
It’s a Jacob thing.

956
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:02,420
You're just warm.

957
01:24:04,632 --> 01:24:06,757
You're like your own sun.

958
01:24:10,179 --> 01:24:13,890
This is better, now
that you know about me.

959
01:24:17,228 --> 01:24:19,228
But...

960
01:24:23,735 --> 01:24:26,370
You saw what happened to Emily.

961
01:24:29,449 --> 01:24:31,449
Sam got angry.

962
01:24:31,951 --> 01:24:34,246
Lost it for a split second.

963
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:37,790
Em was standing too close.

964
01:24:40,084 --> 01:24:43,314
He'll never be able to take that back.

965
01:24:45,423 --> 01:24:47,548
What if l got mad at you?

966
01:24:58,895 --> 01:25:00,895
Sometimes,

967
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:05,830
l feel like I’m gonna disappear.

968
01:25:12,075 --> 01:25:14,540
Okay, not that you need me...

969
01:25:14,994 --> 01:25:17,969
...to tell you something like this,

970
01:25:18,956 --> 01:25:23,121
but l always will.
You're not gonna lose yourself.

971
01:25:25,463 --> 01:25:27,758
l wouldn't let that happen.

972
01:25:29,884 --> 01:25:31,884
How?

973
01:25:34,597 --> 01:25:37,232
I’ll tell you all the time...

974
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,521
...how special you are.

975
01:26:01,999 --> 01:26:04,209
Thank you. For everything.

976
01:26:11,259 --> 01:26:13,259
Wait.

977
01:26:15,221 --> 01:26:17,221
There's a vampire.

978
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:19,250
How do you know?

979
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:23,129
l can smell it. I’m getting you out of here.

980
01:26:23,229 --> 01:26:25,229
That's Carlisle's car.

981
01:26:26,315 --> 01:26:28,092
They're here.

982
01:26:28,192 --> 01:26:32,357
Bella, it's a trick. Stop.
You gotta come with me.

983
01:26:35,283 --> 01:26:36,893
They won't hurt me.

984
01:26:36,993 --> 01:26:40,730
lf a Cullen is back here,
this is their territory.

985
01:26:40,830 --> 01:26:43,232
Treaty says we can only
defend on our own lands.

986
01:26:43,332 --> 01:26:48,772
l can't protect you here.
- Okay. That's okay. You don't have to.

987
01:26:49,922 --> 01:26:51,657
You're about to cross a line.

988
01:26:51,757 --> 01:26:53,757
Then don't draw one.

989
01:26:53,968 --> 01:26:55,968
Please?

990
01:27:12,153 --> 01:27:13,554
Alice?

991
01:27:13,654 --> 01:27:16,629
Oh, my God. What are you...
- Bella.

992
01:27:16,866 --> 01:27:21,020
I’m sorry, l just, l can't
believe you're here. Is...

993
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:25,066
Would you like to explain
to me how you're alive?

994
01:27:25,166 --> 01:27:26,192
What?

995
01:27:26,292 --> 01:27:30,202
l saw a vision of you. You jumped off a cliff.

996
01:27:30,421 --> 01:27:32,532
Why in the hell would you
try and kill yourself?

997
01:27:32,632 --> 01:27:33,741
l mean, what about Charlie?

998
01:27:33,841 --> 01:27:36,577
What about...
- l didn't try to kill myself.

999
01:27:36,677 --> 01:27:38,121
I was cliff jumping.

1000
01:27:38,221 --> 01:27:39,956
Recreationally.

1001
01:27:40,056 --> 01:27:42,056
It was fun.

1002
01:27:43,684 --> 01:27:48,869
l have never met anyone more prone
to life-threatening idiocy.

1003
01:27:53,194 --> 01:27:54,762
Does...

1004
01:27:54,862 --> 01:27:56,905
Did you tell him?

1005
01:27:56,989 --> 01:27:58,989
No.

1006
01:27:59,742 --> 01:28:03,057
He only calls in once every few months.

1007
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:06,545
He said he wants to be alone.

1008
01:28:12,171 --> 01:28:15,826
Bella, what is that
God-awful wet dog smell?

1009
01:28:17,009 --> 01:28:18,744
Um...

1010
01:28:18,844 --> 01:28:20,844
That's probably me.

1011
01:28:21,597 --> 01:28:23,848
Or it's Jacob.

1012
01:28:25,101 --> 01:28:27,101
Jacob who?

1013
01:28:27,853 --> 01:28:30,148
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.

1014
01:28:31,565 --> 01:28:35,475
Bella. Werewolves are not
good company to keep.

1015
01:28:35,987 --> 01:28:37,987
Speak for yourself.

1016
01:28:42,702 --> 01:28:44,997
l had to see you were safe.

1017
01:28:46,414 --> 01:28:49,358
l thought you couldn't protect me here.

1018
01:28:49,458 --> 01:28:51,458
Guess l don't care.

1019
01:28:54,922 --> 01:28:57,557
Well, I’m not gonna hurt her.

1020
01:28:58,801 --> 01:29:00,703
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.

1021
01:29:00,803 --> 01:29:04,207
I’m talking about the other bloodsucker
who tried to kill Bella because of you.

1022
01:29:04,307 --> 01:29:05,333
Victoria?

1023
01:29:05,433 --> 01:29:07,543
Yeah, Victoria's been around.

1024
01:29:07,643 --> 01:29:09,643
l didn't see her.

1025
01:29:09,895 --> 01:29:14,315
l didn't see you get pulled
out of the water, either.

1026
01:29:14,358 --> 01:29:17,303
l can't see past you and your pack of mutts.

1027
01:29:17,403 --> 01:29:19,529
Don't get me upset...

1028
01:29:19,613 --> 01:29:25,733
Hey, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop.
- ...or things are gonna get very ugly.

1029
01:29:29,165 --> 01:29:31,290
I’ll give you a minute.

1030
01:29:37,089 --> 01:29:39,089
Hey.

1031
01:29:39,258 --> 01:29:41,827
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna come back,

1032
01:29:41,927 --> 01:29:45,242
right?
- As soon as you put the dog out.

1033
01:29:53,731 --> 01:29:55,731
Is he...

1034
01:29:59,236 --> 01:30:00,763
Are there others?
How many Cullen’s are here...

1035
01:30:00,863 --> 01:30:03,015
...and how long are they staying?

1036
01:30:03,115 --> 01:30:05,115
No.

1037
01:30:05,117 --> 01:30:07,117
It’s just Alice.

1038
01:30:11,499 --> 01:30:14,814
And she can stay as long as she'd like.

1039
01:30:16,754 --> 01:30:19,389
Well, are the rest coming back?

1040
01:30:25,388 --> 01:30:27,388
No.

1041
01:30:28,307 --> 01:30:30,307
Not that l know of.

1042
01:30:30,935 --> 01:30:32,935
Anything else?

1043
01:30:36,774 --> 01:30:38,774
That's it.

1044
01:30:40,319 --> 01:30:45,164
Well, if that's all, then you'd
better go run back to Sam.

1045
01:30:47,076 --> 01:30:49,076
I’ve done it again.

1046
01:30:49,829 --> 01:30:52,124
l keep breaking my promise.

1047
01:30:57,253 --> 01:31:00,568
We don't have to do this to each other.

1048
01:31:04,468 --> 01:31:06,468
Yes, we do.

1049
01:31:17,857 --> 01:31:19,857
Bella...

1050
01:31:42,089 --> 01:31:44,089
Swan residence.

1051
01:31:49,472 --> 01:31:51,556
He's not here right now.

1052
01:31:52,266 --> 01:31:54,391
He's arranging a funeral.

1053
01:32:10,117 --> 01:32:11,936
Who was that?

1054
01:32:12,036 --> 01:32:13,062
What?

1055
01:32:13,162 --> 01:32:15,162
Always in the way.

1056
01:32:17,124 --> 01:32:18,317
Who was that?

1057
01:32:18,417 --> 01:32:20,027
Bella, step back.

1058
01:32:20,127 --> 01:32:23,823
Jake, who was that?
- Bella. Bella, it's Edward.

1059
01:32:23,923 --> 01:32:28,598
He thinks you're dead.
Rosalie told him why l came here.

1060
01:32:29,553 --> 01:32:32,248
Why would you...
Why didn't you let me speak to him?

1061
01:32:32,348 --> 01:32:33,499
He didn't ask for you.
- Bella.

1062
01:32:33,599 --> 01:32:37,753
l don't care.
- Bella. Bella. He's going to the Volturi.

1063
01:32:37,853 --> 01:32:39,853
He wants to die, too.

1064
01:32:41,690 --> 01:32:44,802
He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you anymore. Remember?

1065
01:32:44,902 --> 01:32:48,973
No, I’m not gonna let him
kill himself out of guilt.

1066
01:32:49,073 --> 01:32:51,073
What about your dad?

1067
01:32:51,450 --> 01:32:55,955
I’m 18. I’m legally free
to go, and l left a note.

1068
01:32:56,622 --> 01:32:58,622
Please, Bella,

1069
01:32:59,792 --> 01:33:01,876
just stay here.

1070
01:33:03,629 --> 01:33:05,629
For Charlie.

1071
01:33:07,967 --> 01:33:09,967
Or for me.

1072
01:33:10,553 --> 01:33:12,553
l have to go.

1073
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:20,060
I’m begging you.

1074
01:33:22,481 --> 01:33:24,481
Please.

1075
01:33:25,609 --> 01:33:27,609
Goodbye, Jacob.

1076
01:33:35,744 --> 01:33:37,744
Okay.

1077
01:34:38,390 --> 01:34:40,855
So you've made up your minds.

1078
01:34:40,976 --> 01:34:44,121
I’m afraid your particular gifts...

1079
01:34:44,563 --> 01:34:47,198
...are too valuable to destroy.

1080
01:34:47,858 --> 01:34:52,737
But if you're unhappy with your lot, join us.

1081
01:34:53,864 --> 01:34:57,689
We would be delighted to utilize your skills.

1082
01:34:58,535 --> 01:35:01,510
Won't you consider staying with us?

1083
01:35:02,873 --> 01:35:05,192
You know it will happen anyway.

1084
01:35:05,292 --> 01:35:07,292
Not without cause.

1085
01:35:11,465 --> 01:35:13,465
Such a waste.

1086
01:35:20,265 --> 01:35:22,042
I’m guessing you didn't rent this car?

1087
01:35:22,142 --> 01:35:24,169
l figured you wouldn't be
opposed to grand theft auto.

1088
01:35:24,269 --> 01:35:26,269
Not today.

1089
01:35:28,982 --> 01:35:30,634
What? What do you see?

1090
01:35:30,734 --> 01:35:32,595
They refused him.

1091
01:35:32,695 --> 01:35:35,160
So?
- He's gonna make a scene.

1092
01:35:35,447 --> 01:35:38,677
Show himself to the humans.
- No. When?

1093
01:35:39,326 --> 01:35:44,171
He's gonna wait until noon,
when the sun's at its highest.

1094
01:35:45,124 --> 01:35:46,317
God, Alice, you got to hurry up.

1095
01:35:46,417 --> 01:35:48,417
There's Volterra.

1096
01:36:13,068 --> 01:36:15,888
Why are they all in red?
- San Marco's Day festival.

1097
01:36:15,988 --> 01:36:18,766
They're commemorating the expulsion
of vampires from the city.

1098
01:36:18,866 --> 01:36:20,184
It’s the perfect setting.

1099
01:36:20,284 --> 01:36:22,811
The Volturi will never let him get
far enough to reveal himself.

1100
01:36:22,911 --> 01:36:24,605
We have five minutes.

1101
01:36:24,705 --> 01:36:27,085
l know, Bella, just breathe.

1102
01:36:33,088 --> 01:36:34,073
Alice.

1103
01:36:34,173 --> 01:36:36,325
Bella, you're the only
one he can't see coming.

1104
01:36:36,425 --> 01:36:40,162
lf l go, he'll read my thoughts.
He'll think I’m lying. He'll rush into it.

1105
01:36:40,262 --> 01:36:44,597
Where do l go?
- He'll be under the clock tower. Go.

1106
01:38:36,044 --> 01:38:38,044
Don't.

1107
01:38:39,464 --> 01:38:40,574
Heaven.

1108
01:38:40,674 --> 01:38:42,674
You have to move.

1109
01:38:43,176 --> 01:38:46,576
Open your eyes. Look at me. I’m alive.

1110
01:38:46,722 --> 01:38:48,722
You have to move.

1111
01:38:49,308 --> 01:38:51,308
Bella.

1112
01:38:58,025 --> 01:39:00,151
You're here.
- I’m here.

1113
01:39:02,988 --> 01:39:04,988
You're alive.

1114
01:39:07,659 --> 01:39:09,659
Yes.

1115
01:39:18,337 --> 01:39:21,142
l needed to make you see me once.

1116
01:39:21,965 --> 01:39:23,242
You had to know that l was alive,

1117
01:39:23,342 --> 01:39:27,592
that you didn't have to
feel guilty about anything.

1118
01:39:29,348 --> 01:39:31,933
l can let you go now.

1119
01:39:36,688 --> 01:39:38,983
l never acted out of guilt.

1120
01:39:41,318 --> 01:39:45,823
l just couldn't live in a
world where you don't exist.

1121
01:39:46,198 --> 01:39:48,240
But you said...
- l lied.

1122
01:39:48,951 --> 01:39:52,606
l had to lie.
But you believed me so easily.

1123
01:39:57,709 --> 01:40:01,789
Because it doesn't make
sense for you to love me.

1124
01:40:04,007 --> 01:40:08,257
l mean, I’m nothing.
I’m human. I’m nothing.

1125
01:40:08,804 --> 01:40:12,390
Bella, you're everything to me.

1126
01:40:14,351 --> 01:40:16,351
You're everything.

1127
01:40:41,753 --> 01:40:43,822
l won't be needing your
services after all, gentlemen.

1128
01:40:43,922 --> 01:40:45,991
Aro wants to speak with you again.

1129
01:40:46,091 --> 01:40:47,326
No rules were broken.

1130
01:40:47,426 --> 01:40:51,580
Nonetheless, we should take this
conversation to a more appropriate venue.

1131
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:53,680
Fine.

1132
01:40:54,266 --> 01:40:56,585
Bella, why don't you go and
enjoy the rest of the festival?

1133
01:40:56,685 --> 01:40:58,003
The girl comes with us.

1134
01:40:58,103 --> 01:41:00,103
No. You can go to hell.

1135
01:41:02,190 --> 01:41:03,926
Come on, guys.

1136
01:41:04,026 --> 01:41:08,180
It’s a festival.
You wouldn't want to make a scene.

1137
01:41:08,280 --> 01:41:09,973
We wouldn't.

1138
01:41:10,073 --> 01:41:12,073
Enough.

1139
01:41:12,951 --> 01:41:14,811
Jane.

1140
01:41:14,911 --> 01:41:18,566
Aro sent me to see what
was taking so long.

1141
01:41:25,964 --> 01:41:27,964
Just do as she says.

1142
01:41:40,479 --> 01:41:42,479
Go ahead.

1143
01:41:45,859 --> 01:41:47,859
Don't be scared.

1144
01:41:48,487 --> 01:41:50,487
Are you?

1145
01:41:50,781 --> 01:41:52,781
No.

1146
01:42:30,445 --> 01:42:32,571
Is she human?
- Yes.

1147
01:42:35,742 --> 01:42:37,742
Does she know?

1148
01:42:37,869 --> 01:42:39,271
Yes.

1149
01:42:39,371 --> 01:42:41,371
Then, why would...

1150
01:42:42,791 --> 01:42:44,791
She wants to be.

1151
01:42:45,043 --> 01:42:46,445
And so she will be.

1152
01:42:46,545 --> 01:42:48,545
Or dessert.

1153
01:42:56,471 --> 01:43:00,917
Sister. They send you out to get
one and you bring back two.

1154
01:43:01,017 --> 01:43:03,017
And a half.

1155
01:43:03,645 --> 01:43:05,005
Such a clever girl.

1156
01:43:05,105 --> 01:43:07,105
What a happy surprise.

1157
01:43:08,066 --> 01:43:10,734
Bella is alive after all.

1158
01:43:11,611 --> 01:43:14,280
Isn't that wonderful?

1159
01:43:15,407 --> 01:43:17,407
l love a happy ending.

1160
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:20,410
Ah.

1161
01:43:21,746 --> 01:43:23,746
They are so rare.

1162
01:43:30,422 --> 01:43:33,397
Her blood appeals to you so much...

1163
01:43:34,217 --> 01:43:36,217
...it makes me thirsty.

1164
01:43:36,303 --> 01:43:39,164
How can you stand to be so close to her?

1165
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:43,684
It’s not without difficulty.
- Yes, l can see that.

1166
01:43:45,687 --> 01:43:50,175
Aro can read every thought
I’ve ever had with one touch.

1167
01:43:50,275 --> 01:43:52,655
And now you know everything.

1168
01:43:53,111 --> 01:43:55,111
So get on with it.

1169
01:43:58,033 --> 01:44:01,773
You are quite a soul
reader yourself, Edward.

1170
01:44:02,871 --> 01:44:07,124
Though you can't read Bella's thoughts.

1171
01:44:10,545 --> 01:44:12,545
Fascinating.

1172
01:44:15,550 --> 01:44:20,990
l would love to see if you are an
exception to my gifts, as well.

1173
01:44:23,642 --> 01:44:25,852
Would you do me the honour?

1174
01:44:46,665 --> 01:44:48,358
Interesting.

1175
01:44:48,458 --> 01:44:50,152
Hmm.

1176
01:44:50,252 --> 01:44:52,252
l see nothing.

1177
01:45:01,179 --> 01:45:03,179
l wonder if...

1178
01:45:03,556 --> 01:45:07,296
Let us see if she's
immune to all our powers.

1179
01:45:08,103 --> 01:45:10,103
Shall we, Jane?

1180
01:45:11,439 --> 01:45:13,439
No.
- Pain.

1181
01:45:29,207 --> 01:45:31,207
Stop.

1182
01:45:31,376 --> 01:45:33,111
Stop. Please. Stop.

1183
01:45:33,211 --> 01:45:37,047
Stop. Just stop hurting him.
Please. Please.

1184
01:45:38,758 --> 01:45:40,758
Jane?

1185
01:45:42,095 --> 01:45:44,095
Master?

1186
01:45:47,684 --> 01:45:49,684
Go ahead, my dear.

1187
01:45:54,899 --> 01:45:57,279
This may hurt just a little.

1188
01:46:13,251 --> 01:46:15,251
Remarkable.

1189
01:46:16,963 --> 01:46:19,214
She confounds us all.

1190
01:46:20,258 --> 01:46:23,427
So what do we do with you now?

1191
01:46:23,970 --> 01:46:27,795
You already know what
you're going to do, Aro.

1192
01:46:28,099 --> 01:46:30,099
She knows too much.

1193
01:46:30,477 --> 01:46:32,477
She's a liability.

1194
01:46:33,605 --> 01:46:35,605
Hmm.

1195
01:46:36,232 --> 01:46:38,232
That's true.

1196
01:46:41,654 --> 01:46:43,654
Felix?

1197
01:46:46,826 --> 01:46:48,826
No.

1198
01:47:49,472 --> 01:47:52,558
Please. No. No. Please, please.

1199
01:47:55,437 --> 01:47:58,564
Kill me. Kill me. Not him.

1200
01:48:09,576 --> 01:48:12,119
How extraordinary.

1201
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:18,250
You would give up your
life for someone like us.

1202
01:48:19,377 --> 01:48:21,377
A vampire.

1203
01:48:22,130 --> 01:48:24,548
A soulless monster.

1204
01:48:24,632 --> 01:48:26,633
Just get away from her.

1205
01:48:30,722 --> 01:48:35,184
You don't know a thing about his soul.

1206
01:48:46,779 --> 01:48:48,779
This is a sadness.

1207
01:48:50,617 --> 01:48:55,207
lf only it were your intention
to give her immortality.

1208
01:49:03,087 --> 01:49:05,087
Wait.

1209
01:49:06,007 --> 01:49:08,091
Bella will be one of us.

1210
01:49:09,802 --> 01:49:11,802
I’ve seen it.

1211
01:49:13,097 --> 01:49:15,222
I’ll change her myself.

1212
01:49:48,925 --> 01:49:50,743
Mesmerizing.

1213
01:49:50,843 --> 01:49:55,264
To see what you have seen
before it has happened.

1214
01:49:58,184 --> 01:50:02,646
Your gifts will make for an intriguing...

1215
01:50:03,898 --> 01:50:05,898
...immortal,

1216
01:50:06,401 --> 01:50:08,401
Isabella.

1217
01:50:12,824 --> 01:50:14,824
Go now.

1218
01:50:14,951 --> 01:50:16,951
Make your preparations.

1219
01:50:17,704 --> 01:50:19,829
Let us be done with this.

1220
01:50:21,541 --> 01:50:24,006
Heidi will arrive any moment.

1221
01:50:25,670 --> 01:50:29,089
Thank you for your visit.

1222
01:50:29,173 --> 01:50:30,700
We will return the favour.

1223
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:33,745
l would advise that you follow
through on your promise soon.

1224
01:50:33,845 --> 01:50:36,480
We do not offer second chances.

1225
01:50:37,849 --> 01:50:40,934
Goodbye, my young friends.

1226
01:50:47,317 --> 01:50:49,093
Nice fishing, Heidi.

1227
01:50:49,193 --> 01:50:51,429
Yes, they do look rather juicy.

1228
01:50:51,529 --> 01:50:53,529
Save some for me.

1229
01:50:54,198 --> 01:50:57,034
This way, please. Stay together.

1230
01:51:11,674 --> 01:51:13,674
Stop. Stop.

1231
01:51:24,062 --> 01:51:26,062
You're here.

1232
01:51:27,649 --> 01:51:29,649
You can sleep.

1233
01:51:33,029 --> 01:51:36,259
I’ll still be here when you wake up.

1234
01:51:39,243 --> 01:51:42,287
Bella, the only reason l left...

1235
01:51:44,082 --> 01:51:47,907
...was because l thought
l was protecting you.

1236
01:51:48,878 --> 01:51:50,488
l needed you...

1237
01:51:50,588 --> 01:51:54,549
...to have a chance at a normal, happy life.

1238
01:51:58,638 --> 01:52:01,358
It was so easy for you to leave.

1239
01:52:03,601 --> 01:52:08,531
Leaving you was the hardest
thing I’ve done in 100 years.

1240
01:52:14,070 --> 01:52:16,070
And l swear,

1241
01:52:16,948 --> 01:52:19,616
l will never fail you again.

1242
01:52:21,911 --> 01:52:23,911
I’m so sorry.

1243
01:52:25,873 --> 01:52:27,873
Charlie's coming.
- Hey.

1244
01:52:30,962 --> 01:52:32,962
You okay?

1245
01:52:33,756 --> 01:52:35,756
I’m fine.

1246
01:52:38,136 --> 01:52:40,601
Dad, you don't have to worry.

1247
01:52:40,805 --> 01:52:42,790
You know, last time you
said that, you took off.

1248
01:52:42,890 --> 01:52:45,610
l didn't see you for three days.

1249
01:52:46,769 --> 01:52:48,809
I’m really sorry, Dad.

1250
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:54,151
Bella, do not ever do that to me again.

1251
01:52:56,988 --> 01:52:58,988
Ever.

1252
01:53:00,867 --> 01:53:02,867
And you're grounded...

1253
01:53:02,910 --> 01:53:05,375
...for the rest of your life.

1254
01:53:06,205 --> 01:53:08,205
Okay.

1255
01:53:17,675 --> 01:53:21,670
I’m not technically
breaking any of his rules.

1256
01:53:23,473 --> 01:53:27,085
He did say l couldn't take
a step inside the door.

1257
01:53:27,185 --> 01:53:29,650
l came in through the window.

1258
01:53:33,107 --> 01:53:35,912
He's not gonna forgive me easily.

1259
01:53:38,070 --> 01:53:40,070
l know.

1260
01:53:41,407 --> 01:53:43,407
Can you?

1261
01:53:46,537 --> 01:53:48,537
l hope you can,

1262
01:53:48,915 --> 01:53:53,335
'cause l honestly don't know
how to live without you.

1263
01:53:56,464 --> 01:53:58,464
Come here.

1264
01:54:15,525 --> 01:54:18,485
Once Alice changes me,

1265
01:54:21,405 --> 01:54:23,573
you can't get rid of me.

1266
01:54:24,784 --> 01:54:27,249
She won't need to change you.

1267
01:54:27,703 --> 01:54:32,208
There are always ways to keep
the Volturi in the dark.

1268
01:54:32,917 --> 01:54:35,293
No. No.

1269
01:54:42,093 --> 01:54:44,218
You all know what l want.

1270
01:54:46,264 --> 01:54:49,409
And l know how much I’m asking for.

1271
01:54:51,519 --> 01:54:55,006
The only thing that l can think of
for it to be fair is to just vote.

1272
01:54:55,106 --> 01:54:59,441
You don't know what you're talking about.
- Shut up.

1273
01:55:00,069 --> 01:55:01,637
Alice?

1274
01:55:01,737 --> 01:55:04,542
l already consider you my sister.

1275
01:55:08,077 --> 01:55:09,687
Yes.
- Thank you.

1276
01:55:09,787 --> 01:55:11,787
l vote 'yes.'

1277
01:55:12,707 --> 01:55:17,212
It would be nice to not want
to kill you all the time.

1278
01:55:18,087 --> 01:55:19,113
Hmm.

1279
01:55:19,213 --> 01:55:21,213
I’m sorry.

1280
01:55:22,466 --> 01:55:26,120
I’m really sorry to both
of you for how I've acted,

1281
01:55:26,220 --> 01:55:28,247
and I’m really grateful
that you were brave enough...

1282
01:55:28,347 --> 01:55:30,812
...to go and save my brother.

1283
01:55:31,976 --> 01:55:36,396
But this isn't a life l would
have chosen for myself.

1284
01:55:37,982 --> 01:55:42,742
And l wish that there'd been
someone to vote 'no' for me.

1285
01:55:44,530 --> 01:55:46,530
So, no.

1286
01:55:47,366 --> 01:55:49,366
I vote 'Hell yeah.'

1287
01:55:51,162 --> 01:55:53,523
And we can pick a fight with
these Volturi some other way.

1288
01:55:53,623 --> 01:55:57,109
I already consider you a part of the family.

1289
01:55:57,209 --> 01:55:59,209
Yes.

1290
01:56:04,342 --> 01:56:06,807
Why are you doing this to me?

1291
01:56:08,262 --> 01:56:09,580
You know what this means.

1292
01:56:09,680 --> 01:56:14,210
You've chosen not to live without
her, which leaves me no choice.

1293
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:16,310
I won't lose my son.

1294
01:56:22,401 --> 01:56:27,756
I’ll wait until after graduation
to make it easier on Charlie.

1295
01:56:31,452 --> 01:56:35,022
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.

1296
01:56:41,379 --> 01:56:43,463
He wants to talk to me.

1297
01:56:46,592 --> 01:56:48,202
So you're still alive for now.

1298
01:56:48,302 --> 01:56:50,746
He thinks it's me keeping you away.

1299
01:56:50,846 --> 01:56:53,651
You stay the hell out of my head.

1300
01:56:54,433 --> 01:56:58,258
Jacob, I know you have
something to say to me.

1301
01:57:00,272 --> 01:57:05,219
But l want to say something to
you first, if that's all right.

1302
01:57:05,319 --> 01:57:07,319
Thank you.

1303
01:57:09,865 --> 01:57:13,686
Thank you for keeping Bella
alive when I didn't.

1304
01:57:13,786 --> 01:57:15,912
No. You didn't.

1305
01:57:17,915 --> 01:57:20,526
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.

1306
01:57:20,626 --> 01:57:22,626
I’m still grateful.

1307
01:57:23,087 --> 01:57:24,280
But I’m here now.

1308
01:57:24,380 --> 01:57:27,074
I’m not gonna leave her side
until she orders me away.

1309
01:57:27,174 --> 01:57:29,174
We'll see.

1310
01:57:31,387 --> 01:57:33,555
Hey, my turn to talk.

1311
01:57:38,102 --> 01:57:41,714
I’m here to remind you about
a key point in the treaty.

1312
01:57:41,814 --> 01:57:43,674
I haven't forgotten.

1313
01:57:43,774 --> 01:57:45,468
What key point?

1314
01:57:45,568 --> 01:57:48,033
lf any of them bites a human,

1315
01:57:48,612 --> 01:57:50,612
the truce is over.

1316
01:57:51,782 --> 01:57:53,601
But if I choose it, it has
nothing to do with you.

1317
01:57:53,701 --> 01:57:55,744
No. No, I won't let you.

1318
01:57:57,329 --> 01:57:59,732
You're not gonna be one of them, Bella.

1319
01:57:59,832 --> 01:58:01,832
It’s not up to you.

1320
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:04,779
You know what we'll do to you.
I won't have a choice.

1321
01:58:04,879 --> 01:58:06,530
Bella, please, come.

1322
01:58:06,630 --> 01:58:08,630
Wait.

1323
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:12,775
Is he gonna hurt me? Read his mind.

1324
01:58:19,727 --> 01:58:21,727
Jake,

1325
01:58:27,485 --> 01:58:29,485
I love you.

1326
01:58:33,824 --> 01:58:35,824
So, please,

1327
01:58:40,039 --> 01:58:42,123
don't make me choose,

1328
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:49,880
'cause it'll be him.

1329
01:58:53,177 --> 01:58:55,177
It’s always been him.

1330
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:04,520
Bella...

1331
01:59:11,654 --> 01:59:15,479
Goodbye, Jacob.
- No, you don't speak for her.

1332
01:59:19,537 --> 01:59:21,538
Bella, get out of here.

1333
01:59:23,332 --> 01:59:25,332
Stop.

1334
01:59:26,877 --> 01:59:28,154
Stop.

1335
01:59:28,254 --> 01:59:31,994
You can't hurt each other
without hurting me.

1336
01:59:50,359 --> 01:59:52,359
Jake.

1337
02:00:06,542 --> 02:00:08,542
He's right.

1338
02:00:09,086 --> 02:00:11,721
You shouldn't become what l am.

1339
02:00:16,427 --> 02:00:18,428
I can't do this alone.

1340
02:00:21,098 --> 02:00:23,138
Then, please, just wait.

1341
02:00:30,065 --> 02:00:32,692
Just give me five years.

1342
02:00:38,282 --> 02:00:40,282
That's too long.

1343
02:00:44,413 --> 02:00:46,413
Then three?

1344
02:00:50,586 --> 02:00:52,586
You're so stubborn.

1345
02:00:54,256 --> 02:00:56,381
What are you waiting for?

1346
02:01:05,100 --> 02:01:08,144
l have one condition...

1347
02:01:10,648 --> 02:01:13,538
...if you want me to do it myself.

1348
02:01:17,238 --> 02:01:19,238
What's the condition?

1349
02:01:19,657 --> 02:01:21,657
And then forever.

1350
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:25,285
That's what I’m asking.

1351
02:01:36,382 --> 02:01:38,382
Marry me, Bella.
