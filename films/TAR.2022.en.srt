1
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,364
<i>You ready?</i>

2
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,597
<i>No, just... Yeah, just-just
ignore the microphone.</i>

3
00:01:23,732 --> 00:01:25,605
<i>Yeah, just-just act as if
it's not there.</i>

4
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:28,306
<i>Sing as if it's not there.</i>

5
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:32,011
<i>Yeah...</i>

6
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:41,580
<i>Okay?</i>

7
00:05:45,164 --> 00:05:47,127
- Ready for them?
- Yes.

8
00:05:47,262 --> 00:05:48,403
Let's go.

9
00:05:56,204 --> 00:05:58,313
<i>If you're here,
then you already know</i>

10
00:05:58,448 --> 00:06:00,749
<i>who she is, and that is one
of the most important</i>

11
00:06:00,884 --> 00:06:03,146
<i>musical figures of our time.</i>

12
00:06:03,282 --> 00:06:05,210
<i>Lydia Tár is many things:</i>

13
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:08,647
<i>A piano performance graduate
at the Curtis Institute,</i>

14
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:11,152
<i>Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard.</i>

15
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:15,327
<i>She got her PhD in Musicology
from the University of Vienna,</i>

16
00:06:15,463 --> 00:06:17,924
<i>specializing in
the indigenous music</i>

17
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:20,900
<i>of the Ucayali Valley
in Eastern Peru,</i>

18
00:06:21,036 --> 00:06:22,936
<i>where she spent five years</i>

19
00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:24,930
<i>among the Shipibo-Konibo peopl.</i>

20
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:28,568
<i>As a conductor,
Tár began her career</i>

21
00:06:28,703 --> 00:06:29,935
<i>with the Cleveland Orchestra,</i>

22
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,542
<i>one of the so-called "Big Five."</i>

23
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:33,841
<i>A string of
important posts followed,</i>

24
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,344
<i>including
the Philadelphia Orchestra,</i>

25
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,719
<i>the Chicago Symphony Orchestra,</i>

26
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:39,084
<i>the Boston Symphony Orchestra,</i>

27
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:40,956
<i>until she at last arrived here</i>

28
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:44,056
<i>at our own
New York Philharmonic.</i>

29
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:45,523
<i>With the latter, she organized</i>

30
00:06:45,658 --> 00:06:48,130
<i>the Highway 10
refugee concerts in Zaatari,</i>

31
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:52,529
<i>which were attended
by over 75,000 people.</i>

32
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:54,201
<i>She's become particularly
well-known</i>

33
00:06:54,337 --> 00:06:56,029
<i>for commissioning
contemporary work</i>

34
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:59,239
<i>from, among others,
Jennifer Higdon, Caroline Shaw,</i>

35
00:06:59,374 --> 00:07:01,705
<i>Julia Wolfe
and Hildur Gudnadóttir.</i>

36
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,871
<i>And she's made a point
of programming their works</i>

37
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:07,948
<i>alongside composers
of the canon.</i>

38
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,382
<i>She's been quoted as saying,</i>

39
00:07:09,518 --> 00:07:12,219
<i>"These composers
are having a conversation</i>

40
00:07:12,354 --> 00:07:15,215
<i>and it may not always
be so polite."</i>

41
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,823
<i>Lydia Tár has also written
music for the stage and screen.</i>

42
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:22,562
<i>She is in fact one of only 15
so-called EGOTs, meaning those</i>

43
00:07:22,697 --> 00:07:26,894
<i>who have won all four
major entertainment awards:</i>

44
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,563
<i>An Emmy, a Grammy,
an Oscar and a Tony.</i>

45
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:32,141
<i>It is, as you can imagine,</i>

46
00:07:32,276 --> 00:07:34,605
<i>an extremely short
and shimmering list</i>

47
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:37,774
<i>that includes Richard Rodgers,
Audrey Hepburn,</i>

48
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:41,683
<i>Andrew Lloyd Webber
and, of course, Mel Brooks.</i>

49
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:48,915
In 2010, with
the support of Eliot Kaplan,

50
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,921
she founded the Accordion
Conducting Fellowship,

51
00:07:52,057 --> 00:07:54,954
which fosters entrepreneurship
and performance opportunities

52
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,166
for female conductors,
allowing them residencies

53
00:07:58,301 --> 00:08:01,094
with major orchestras
around the world.

54
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:06,203
In 2013, Berlin elected Tár
as its principal conductor,

55
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:08,801
in succession to Andris Davis,

56
00:08:08,937 --> 00:08:11,771
and she's remained there
ever since.

57
00:08:11,906 --> 00:08:13,610
Like her mentor,
Leonard Bernstein,

58
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:16,776
Tár has a particular
affinity for Mahler,

59
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:18,952
whose nine symphonies
she recorded

60
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:21,246
during her Big Five stints.

61
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:23,721
However, she never managed
to complete

62
00:08:23,857 --> 00:08:27,453
the so-called "cycle" with
a single orchestra until now.

63
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:28,858
Under her direction,

64
00:08:28,993 --> 00:08:30,993
Berlin has recorded eight
of the Mahler symphonies,

65
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,794
saving the big one,
Symphony No. 5, for last.

66
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,864
Due to the pandemic,
that performance,

67
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,631
which was scheduled for
last year, had to be canceled.

68
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:40,473
But I'm told that next month,

69
00:08:40,608 --> 00:08:43,174
she'll make a live recording
of Mahler's Fifth,

70
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,807
which will complete the cycle

71
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:48,478
and will be issued in a box set
by Deutsche Grammophon

72
00:08:48,614 --> 00:08:50,649
just in time
for Mahler's birthday.

73
00:08:50,785 --> 00:08:54,520
As if that's not enough,
her new book,<i> Tár on Tár,</i>

74
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:58,316
will be published by Nan
Talese's imprint at Doubleday,

75
00:08:58,452 --> 00:09:01,493
just in time for Christmas,
a perfect stocking stuffer,

76
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:03,896
especially if you have
a very large stocking.

77
00:09:05,566 --> 00:09:07,126
All of us at<i> The New Yorker</i>
welcome you.

78
00:09:07,238 --> 00:09:08,936
Thank you for joining us,
Maestro, today.

79
00:09:09,071 --> 00:09:10,763
Thank you, Adam. Thank you.

80
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:13,373
Thank you.

81
00:09:14,702 --> 00:09:16,609
Lydia, I couldn't...

82
00:09:16,744 --> 00:09:19,946
I couldn't help but see you
flinch just a little bit

83
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:21,580
as I was reading your bio.

84
00:09:21,715 --> 00:09:23,875
Was it because I forgot
some other amazing achievement?

85
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,271
Or do you have
a slight self-consciousness

86
00:09:26,322 --> 00:09:28,350
about the incredibly
varied things

87
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:30,391
that you've accomplished?

88
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:35,525
Well, in today's world,
"varied," it-it's a dirty word.

89
00:09:35,661 --> 00:09:37,629
I mean,
our era is one of specialists,

90
00:09:37,764 --> 00:09:40,563
and if you're trying to do
more than one thing,

91
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:42,365
it's, you know,
it's often frowned upon.

92
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,970
Every artist gets typecast.

93
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:45,472
Oh, yes. Aggressively so.

94
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:47,487
Well, do you think there'll be
a moment, though,

95
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:49,409
when the classical music
community,

96
00:09:49,544 --> 00:09:52,880
decides not to use
sexual distinctions

97
00:09:53,016 --> 00:09:55,050
to differentiate artists?

98
00:09:55,186 --> 00:09:57,250
I'm probably
the wrong person to ask

99
00:09:57,386 --> 00:09:59,711
since I don't read reviews.

100
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:01,280
- Never, really?
- No.

101
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:05,491
But it is odd, I think,
that anyone ever felt compelled

102
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:08,463
to substitute
"maestro" with "maestra."

103
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:11,794
I mean, we don't call women
astronauts "astronettes."

104
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:13,565
Right.

105
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,338
But as to the question
of gender bias,

106
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:19,903
I really have nothing
to complain about.

107
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,069
Nor, for that matter, should
Marin Alsop, JoAnn Falletta,

108
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:25,345
Laurence Equilbey
and Nathalie Stutzmann.

109
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,112
I mean, there's so many
incredible women

110
00:10:28,248 --> 00:10:29,581
who came before us.

111
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:32,017
You know, women who did
the-the real lifting.

112
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:33,251
That-that's fascinating.

113
00:10:33,387 --> 00:10:35,250
Can you... Who, for instance?

114
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,488
Okay, sure.

115
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:38,689
First and foremost,
Nadia Boulanger.

116
00:10:38,824 --> 00:10:41,657
I mean, that would be
the happy example.

117
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:44,927
The sad one would be
Antonia Brico,

118
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:47,831
who by all accounts
was an incredible conductor

119
00:10:47,966 --> 00:10:51,202
but was ghettoized
into the nonglamorous status

120
00:10:51,337 --> 00:10:53,273
of a "guest conductor"

121
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:56,177
and essentially
treated as a dog act.

122
00:10:56,313 --> 00:10:58,440
A dog...
She never got the chance

123
00:10:58,576 --> 00:10:59,616
to lead a major orchestra?

124
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:01,680
Well, yes. Yes, she did conduct

125
00:11:01,816 --> 00:11:04,109
the Berlin Philharmonic,
as well as the Met,

126
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:07,278
but, again,
only as a guest conductor.

127
00:11:07,414 --> 00:11:09,134
You know, at, I mean,
at that time it was...

128
00:11:09,257 --> 00:11:11,388
it was all gender spectacle.

129
00:11:11,524 --> 00:11:13,052
But fortunately, times change,

130
00:11:13,187 --> 00:11:14,792
and-and the Pauline
conversion is...

131
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:16,625
- "Pauline..."
- if not complete,

132
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,300
then it's-it's evolving nicely.

133
00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:20,960
N-No less
having fallen off its horse.

134
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:23,236
Lydia, could we talk
a little bit

135
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:25,371
about translation?

136
00:11:25,507 --> 00:11:27,003
'Cause I think
there's still people

137
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:30,510
who think of the conductor
as a kind of human metronome.

138
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,414
Well, yeah,
that's-that's partly true.

139
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:36,247
- Yeah, but it's...
- But keeping time,

140
00:11:36,383 --> 00:11:37,815
it's-it's no small thing.

141
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:40,012
But I suspect there's
a lot more to it than that.

142
00:11:40,148 --> 00:11:41,518
Yeah, well,
I would hope so, yes.

143
00:11:41,654 --> 00:11:44,316
But time is the thing.

144
00:11:44,452 --> 00:11:48,524
Time is-is the essential piece
of interpretation.

145
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:50,326
You cannot start without me.

146
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:52,400
See, I start the clock.

147
00:11:52,536 --> 00:11:55,833
Now, my left hand shapes,
but my right hand,

148
00:11:55,969 --> 00:12:00,333
the second hand, marks time
and moves it forward.

149
00:12:00,468 --> 00:12:04,210
However, unlike a clock,
sometimes my second hand stops,

150
00:12:04,345 --> 00:12:07,348
which means that time stops.

151
00:12:07,483 --> 00:12:10,518
Now, the illusion is that,
like you,

152
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:12,754
I'm responding to
the orchestra in real time...

153
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:15,408
- Right, right.
- Making the decision about the right moment...

154
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:16,806
to restart the thing,
or reset it,

155
00:12:16,941 --> 00:12:19,351
or throw time out
the window altogether.

156
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:22,527
The reality is that right
from the very beginning,

157
00:12:22,662 --> 00:12:24,630
I know precisely
what time it is...

158
00:12:24,766 --> 00:12:26,568
- Really? That's...
- and the exact moment

159
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,569
that you and I will arrive
at our destination together.

160
00:12:29,704 --> 00:12:33,236
You know, the only real discovery for me

161
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:35,133
is in rehearsal.

162
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:37,040
It's never,
never in performance.

163
00:12:37,176 --> 00:12:41,074
Hard question, I know, but
if you could define one thing

164
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,078
that Bernstein gave you,
what would it be?

165
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:47,320
Kavvanah.

166
00:12:47,455 --> 00:12:48,695
Yeah, it's-it's the Hebrew word

167
00:12:48,788 --> 00:12:51,591
for attention to meaning
or-or intent.

168
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:53,487
You know, what are
the composer's priorities,

169
00:12:53,518 --> 00:12:55,838
and what are yours, and how do
they complement one another?

170
00:12:55,863 --> 00:12:57,943
Right, kavvanah. I think
that's a word that will have

171
00:12:57,968 --> 00:13:00,088
a slightly different meaning
for many in our audience.

172
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:03,271
Well, yes, yes, I imagine so.

173
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,927
Am I right in thinking
that a conductor

174
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,408
was not always
an onstage presence

175
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:08,950
- in classical music?
- No, that's right.

176
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:10,909
I think I read someplace
that it actually was

177
00:13:11,045 --> 00:13:13,205
the first violin, for a long
time, who was responsible.

178
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,808
Yes, the first violinist,
whether they had any interest

179
00:13:15,944 --> 00:13:17,408
or-or skill in it or not.

180
00:13:17,544 --> 00:13:20,247
Wh-When did that change,
and-and who changed it?

181
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,415
With the French composer,
Jean-Baptiste Lully,

182
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,420
who reportedly
used a rather enormous,

183
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:31,429
rather pointy staff to pound
the tempi into the floor.

184
00:13:31,564 --> 00:13:32,698
It's not something I imagine

185
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:35,164
the players particularly appreciated.

186
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,105
Anyway that technique
ended during a performance

187
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:41,104
when Lully accidentally

188
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:43,435
stabbed himself in the foot
with the thing and died.

189
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,276
Yeah, of-of-of gangrene.

190
00:13:46,412 --> 00:13:48,181
But anyway...

191
00:13:48,316 --> 00:13:51,052
Yeah.

192
00:13:51,188 --> 00:13:54,446
Anyway, but the conductor

193
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:58,183
really becomes essential
as the ensembles get bigger.

194
00:13:58,319 --> 00:14:00,727
And once again,
we go back to Beethoven.

195
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,829
Now, that doesn't start
with the eighth note.

196
00:14:05,964 --> 00:14:08,398
The downbeat... ♪

197
00:14:08,534 --> 00:14:10,195
It's silent, right?

198
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:12,706
So someone had to start
that clock.

199
00:14:12,841 --> 00:14:15,705
Someone had to
plant their flag in the sand

200
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,405
and say, "Follow me," you know?

201
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:21,813
And when that someone was
Lenny, the orchestra was led

202
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:25,982
on the most extraordinary
tour of pleasures.

203
00:14:26,118 --> 00:14:29,047
'Cause he knew the music,
Mahler especially,

204
00:14:29,183 --> 00:14:31,183
as well or better than anyone.

205
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:34,494
And he would often play
with the form.

206
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,070
'Cause he wanted an orchestra
to feel

207
00:14:36,095 --> 00:14:38,224
that they had never seen,
let alone heard

208
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:41,160
or-or performed
any of that music.

209
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:43,437
So he-he would do
radical things,

210
00:14:43,573 --> 00:14:45,704
like disregarding
the tempo primo

211
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,233
or-or ending this phrase
molto ritardando,

212
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:50,870
even though
it had no such marking.

213
00:14:51,005 --> 00:14:52,246
Was he over-egging it?

214
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:53,747
Oh, no, no, no. Not at all.

215
00:14:53,882 --> 00:14:57,548
He, he, he celebrated the joy
of his discovery.

216
00:14:57,684 --> 00:14:59,082
You just told us a moment ago

217
00:14:59,217 --> 00:15:01,589
that your discovery
takes place in rehearsal.

218
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:04,218
When will that process
begin again for you?

219
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:06,457
We start on Monday.

220
00:15:06,593 --> 00:15:08,429
Immediately?

221
00:15:08,565 --> 00:15:10,864
With this one,
it really is about

222
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,393
trying to read the tea leaves
of-of Mahler's intention.

223
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:17,049
I mean, we know a great deal
about this

224
00:15:17,164 --> 00:15:18,696
with his other symphonies.

225
00:15:18,832 --> 00:15:20,939
You know, he was so inspired
by the poetry of Rückert

226
00:15:21,074 --> 00:15:23,378
that for years he didn't set
another author to music.

227
00:15:23,513 --> 00:15:26,378
But all of this changes
with the Five.

228
00:15:26,513 --> 00:15:28,711
The Five is a mystery.

229
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:31,486
And the only clue he leaves us

230
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:33,554
is on the cover
of the manuscript itself.

231
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,558
Yes, the-the dedication
to his new wife, Alma.

232
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:39,557
So if you're gonna partner
with Mahler

233
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:42,395
on his fifth symphony,

234
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,929
the first thing you must do

235
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:48,396
is try to understand
that very complex marriage.

236
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:51,264
And would you say that you have
a different interpretation

237
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,707
of that marriage
than Bernstein did?

238
00:15:55,242 --> 00:15:59,676
You mentioned my ethnographic
fieldwork in the Amazon.

239
00:15:59,812 --> 00:16:02,483
Well, Adam, the Shipibo-Konibo

240
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:05,253
only receive an<i> icaro,</i> or song,

241
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:06,986
if the singer is there, right?

242
00:16:07,122 --> 00:16:10,858
On the same side of the-the
spirit that-that created it.

243
00:16:10,993 --> 00:16:14,453
And in that way, the past
and the present converge.

244
00:16:14,588 --> 00:16:17,963
It's the flip sides
of the same cosmic coin.

245
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:20,963
That definition of fidelity
makes sense to me.

246
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:23,494
But Lenny,
he believed in<i> teshuvah.</i>

247
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,937
The Talmudic power
to reach back into time

248
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:28,934
and-and transform
the significance

249
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:30,504
of one's past deeds.

250
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:34,644
So when he played the Adagietto
at Robert Kennedy's funeral,

251
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:36,816
it ran for 12 minutes.

252
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:39,281
He treated it as a mass.

253
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:41,377
And, you know, if you listen
to a recording of it,

254
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:44,888
you will no doubt feel
the tragedy and-and the pathos.

255
00:16:45,024 --> 00:16:47,561
And of course
that interpretation

256
00:16:47,697 --> 00:16:49,697
was very true for Mahler
later in life,

257
00:16:49,832 --> 00:16:51,796
after the professional bottom
dropped out

258
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:53,866
and Alma had left him
for Gropius.

259
00:16:54,002 --> 00:16:59,136
But, as I said before,
we are dealing with time.

260
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:03,707
And this piece was not born
into aching tragedy.

261
00:17:03,842 --> 00:17:06,147
It was born into young love.

262
00:17:06,283 --> 00:17:08,411
And so you chose...

263
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:09,982
Love.

264
00:17:10,118 --> 00:17:13,012
Right, but precisely how long?

265
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:14,418
Well...

266
00:17:14,554 --> 00:17:16,486
seven minutes.

267
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:23,528
I was so taken
by what you said to Adam

268
00:17:23,664 --> 00:17:26,829
about interpretation

269
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:30,336
and specifically about feelings,

270
00:17:30,472 --> 00:17:32,731
and that you chose love.

271
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,067
And I know it's said
that you should leave the tears

272
00:17:36,203 --> 00:17:38,174
for the audience, but...

273
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,944
do you ever find yourself
overwhelmed by emotion

274
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,680
when you're up there
at the podium?

275
00:17:42,815 --> 00:17:44,582
Yes.

276
00:17:44,717 --> 00:17:46,545
Yes, that does happen.

277
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,689
There's an...
an expectation-reward cycle

278
00:17:49,825 --> 00:17:51,793
with some works
and the spots in them

279
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:54,727
that I find so incredible,
that when I'm conducting,

280
00:17:54,863 --> 00:17:57,128
it's not that
I'm rushing exactly,

281
00:17:57,263 --> 00:17:59,866
but I just can't wait
to get to that spot,

282
00:18:00,002 --> 00:18:02,301
and, yeah, it does it.
It does it every time.

283
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:05,870
So it's physical
as well as emotional.

284
00:18:06,005 --> 00:18:07,870
God, it must take hours

285
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:10,109
to come back down to earth.

286
00:18:10,244 --> 00:18:13,579
You say things after others
remember, but you won't.

287
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:15,815
And sleep, it's impossible.

288
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,943
It's like my freshman year
at Smith.

289
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:23,047
Which piece does that to you?

290
00:18:23,183 --> 00:18:24,484
I saw you.

291
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,756
I saw you conduct
<i>The Rite of Spring</i>

292
00:18:26,891 --> 00:18:28,262
at the Met last year.

293
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,389
It was so powerful.

294
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:32,567
Thank you. Thank you.

295
00:18:32,702 --> 00:18:35,567
It's...
It's the 11 pistol shots...

296
00:18:35,702 --> 00:18:36,936
It's a prime number...

297
00:18:37,071 --> 00:18:39,431
That strike you as both victim
and perpetrator.

298
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:41,087
You know, it's not until
I conducted it

299
00:18:41,142 --> 00:18:44,746
that I became convinced
we're all capable of murder.

300
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:47,505
That is a fantastic handbag,
by the way.

301
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:50,074
Thank you. I'm glad you like it.

302
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:51,677
I do. I do.

303
00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:53,585
Sorry.
Your lunch with Mr. Kaplan.

304
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,321
His driver is waiting.

305
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:56,581
All right.

306
00:18:56,717 --> 00:18:57,867
I-I'm sorry,
I've forgotten your name.

307
00:18:57,892 --> 00:18:59,359
- Whitney. Whitney Reese.
- Whitney.

308
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:00,495
Whitney, of course.

309
00:19:00,627 --> 00:19:01,995
I'm, I'm so sorry,

310
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:03,889
and unfortunately
I've left things a bit late

311
00:19:03,914 --> 00:19:05,514
and there's something
I can't get out of.

312
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:06,266
I understand.

313
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:08,803
Can I text you?

314
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,121
It's perfect, Aldo.

315
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:35,152
I was hoping we could celebrate.

316
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:37,289
No. So was I.

317
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:38,958
I've got a class at Juilliard.

318
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:40,124
Good.

319
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:41,662
I promised Ben.

320
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:45,235
I'm sure you'll have a few
elbowing for an Accordion slot.

321
00:19:46,138 --> 00:19:48,810
We should open up
the fellowship.

322
00:19:48,945 --> 00:19:51,143
- What, expand our numbers?
- No, our sex.

323
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,481
I mean, it feels quaint
to keep things single-gender.

324
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:55,816
We've made our point.

325
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:57,575
And, honestly,
we've had no real trouble

326
00:19:57,711 --> 00:19:59,550
successfully placing
any of them.

327
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:01,486
Except one.

328
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:03,257
Well.

329
00:20:03,392 --> 00:20:05,391
She had issues.

330
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:07,026
So I've heard.

331
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:09,153
The topic comes up
in every Citibank meeting

332
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:11,564
with her father.

333
00:20:11,699 --> 00:20:13,168
I'm sorry about that.

334
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:14,359
It's fine.

335
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:16,665
It's nothing I can't handle.

336
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:21,870
So, you want to torpedo
Accordion's founding principle?

337
00:20:22,006 --> 00:20:23,907
We'd likely lose donors.

338
00:20:24,042 --> 00:20:26,505
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

339
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:28,581
M-Maybe it's something
we revisit

340
00:20:28,716 --> 00:20:30,577
- down the line.
- Sure.

341
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:33,083
Now, Bryant Park's locked
for the 25th.

342
00:20:33,219 --> 00:20:35,185
Nan asked me
to help fill the place,

343
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:37,017
so the Kaplan Fund
is gonna buy some radio

344
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,183
and outdoor advertising.

345
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,362
And claqueurs.

346
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:42,686
It's too big, Eliot.

347
00:20:42,822 --> 00:20:44,231
She should have booked
the Strand.

348
00:20:44,366 --> 00:20:45,563
Relax.

349
00:20:45,698 --> 00:20:47,802
It'll be great.

350
00:20:47,938 --> 00:20:50,333
And it almost falls
on your birthday.

351
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,641
I was I was sorry
you weren't able to make it

352
00:20:54,777 --> 00:20:56,845
to my Mahler Three in London.

353
00:20:57,676 --> 00:20:59,375
Me, too.

354
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,082
Petra had a school thing.

355
00:21:03,217 --> 00:21:07,856
And I promised Sharon
I'd be there.

356
00:21:08,886 --> 00:21:10,891
Of course.

357
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:14,126
I was just hoping
for your honest opinion.

358
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:16,993
My player rating sheets
were off the charts.

359
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:18,966
Those are confidential, Eliot.

360
00:21:19,101 --> 00:21:21,397
Well, the principal oboist
is a big fan.

361
00:21:22,636 --> 00:21:23,905
On the way back,

362
00:21:24,002 --> 00:21:25,842
I was listening to yours
with the Israeli Phil,

363
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,732
and I was struck
by what you managed to pull

364
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:30,074
from the strings
in the last movement.

365
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,677
I mean, how did you
get them there?

366
00:21:33,812 --> 00:21:35,240
Was it the hall?

367
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:36,841
Was it the players?

368
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:39,919
The players weren't
very obliging.

369
00:21:40,055 --> 00:21:41,654
The principal violinist
came up to me

370
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,922
after the first rehearsal

371
00:21:43,058 --> 00:21:45,083
- and asked if I was a Jew.
- What?

372
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:48,029
It seemed to him unusual, if
not suspicious, that a non-Jew

373
00:21:48,164 --> 00:21:51,130
would be interested
in conducting Jewish music.

374
00:21:51,265 --> 00:21:54,133
Felt like Max Bruch.

375
00:21:54,268 --> 00:21:57,596
Well, big Jew that I am,
the Kaplan Fund has

376
00:21:57,731 --> 00:21:59,598
committed a sizable
amount to them

377
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:01,207
for a klezmer commission.

378
00:22:01,342 --> 00:22:03,207
Maybe they'll invite me
to guest conduct.

379
00:22:03,343 --> 00:22:05,269
Well, they'd be lucky
to have you.

380
00:22:05,404 --> 00:22:07,172
Oh, please.

381
00:22:07,307 --> 00:22:09,147
I know my place.

382
00:22:09,283 --> 00:22:11,920
Money can't always
buy you everything.

383
00:22:12,855 --> 00:22:14,989
You don't really believe that.

384
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,119
I'll have you know
I tried to bribe Francesca

385
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:18,822
to let me look at your notation.

386
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:20,394
She sent me packing.

387
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:22,020
Good girl.

388
00:22:23,023 --> 00:22:24,903
That gentleman sitting
over there with the gnome

389
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:27,034
is urgently focused
on our table.

390
00:22:27,169 --> 00:22:30,299
At first, I thought
he was looking at me,

391
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:32,573
but I think he's got
his eye on you.

392
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:34,470
Please try and ignore him.

393
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,709
I can excuse myself
and go wash my hands

394
00:22:36,845 --> 00:22:38,470
if you'd like to be alone.

395
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:41,346
And I would never forgive you.

396
00:22:41,482 --> 00:22:43,574
The last thing I need
is to be buttonholed in here

397
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:45,646
by someone exactly like me.

398
00:22:47,189 --> 00:22:49,157
What time are you
leaving tomorrow?

399
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,383
Francesca's looking
into flights.

400
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:53,725
Well, call her off.

401
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:55,552
Leave when you like.

402
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:57,328
You don't have to do that.

403
00:22:57,463 --> 00:23:01,168
My motives are not entirely
altruistic.

404
00:23:01,303 --> 00:23:03,701
Just one peek. One peek
at your performing score.

405
00:23:06,574 --> 00:23:07,940
Fine.

406
00:23:08,075 --> 00:23:11,069
- Would 5:15 be okay?
- Sure.

407
00:23:11,205 --> 00:23:14,044
Okay, I mean, I do... I have
to get turned around fast.

408
00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:16,378
We're filling a vacant position.

409
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:18,552
Oh, please tell me
it's Sebastian.

410
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,919
Now, be fair, Eliot.

411
00:23:20,054 --> 00:23:22,379
Sebastian has decent technique.

412
00:23:22,515 --> 00:23:23,781
He has baton.

413
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:25,357
A month ago,
I dropped into Bunkamura

414
00:23:25,426 --> 00:23:28,524
to watch the Turing machine
trot out Chopin One.

415
00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:32,060
Ol' Sebastian really
is Mr. Tempo Rubato.

416
00:23:32,196 --> 00:23:33,765
Robot-O is more like it.

417
00:23:33,901 --> 00:23:35,101
Why do you keep him on?

418
00:23:35,236 --> 00:23:37,433
He's Andris's man,
you know that.

419
00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:39,207
Exactly. You inherited
that decision.

420
00:23:39,342 --> 00:23:41,422
Seven years is a long time
to pretend you respect it.

421
00:23:41,447 --> 00:23:43,775
They have different
labor contracts over there.

422
00:23:45,948 --> 00:23:48,911
He's a... he's a strange guy.

423
00:23:49,046 --> 00:23:50,407
Who? Andris?

424
00:23:50,543 --> 00:23:52,411
No, Sebastian.

425
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:54,885
He has fetishes.

426
00:23:55,021 --> 00:23:56,883
Fetishes? Like what?

427
00:23:57,018 --> 00:24:00,585
Nostalgia for prewar Kalmus
miniature scores,

428
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,554
dead-stock pencils he's seen

429
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:04,589
von Karajan hold in photographs.

430
00:24:04,725 --> 00:24:06,557
You know, that sort of thing.

431
00:24:06,693 --> 00:24:09,037
That's just sad.

432
00:24:13,106 --> 00:24:15,571
Yeah, but you're not wrong.

433
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:18,706
I am gonna have to rotate him
at some point.

434
00:24:20,978 --> 00:24:23,381
For who?

435
00:24:27,714 --> 00:24:29,151
<i>What Love Teaches Me.</i>

436
00:24:29,286 --> 00:24:31,554
That string notation.

437
00:24:32,995 --> 00:24:35,228
Mahler gives it to you himself.

438
00:24:37,724 --> 00:24:38,932
- Come on.
- Trust me.

439
00:24:39,067 --> 00:24:40,430
You do not want to go to school

440
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:42,966
on someone else's
red and blue pencil.

441
00:24:43,102 --> 00:24:44,604
Least of all, mine.

442
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,097
But I do.

443
00:24:46,232 --> 00:24:47,712
All right.
Will you quit pestering me?

444
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:49,609
Yes.

445
00:24:49,744 --> 00:24:51,739
Free bowing.

446
00:24:53,172 --> 00:24:55,479
It's not pretty
for an audience to look at,

447
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,223
but if you can manage
to keep your players

448
00:24:57,248 --> 00:24:59,120
out of the weeds...

449
00:24:59,955 --> 00:25:02,156
the sound's ferocious.

450
00:25:09,088 --> 00:25:12,133
There's no glory
for a robot, Eliot.

451
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:17,765
Do your own thing.

452
00:25:40,053 --> 00:25:42,520
All right...

453
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,165
Let's... stop here.

454
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,001
- Thank you, Max. Very good.
- Thanks.

455
00:25:47,136 --> 00:25:51,938
Just for my own edification...

456
00:25:52,074 --> 00:25:54,169
why did you come to Juilliard?

457
00:25:57,545 --> 00:25:59,744
It's the best music
conservatory in the country?

458
00:25:59,879 --> 00:26:02,874
People from Curtis, Eastman,
and others may beg to differ.

459
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:05,351
I mean,
Juilliard's a brand, right?

460
00:26:05,486 --> 00:26:08,187
So, did you come to study
with a brand?

461
00:26:08,323 --> 00:26:10,456
- No.
- No, right. So there's a teacher

462
00:26:10,592 --> 00:26:12,885
or graduate somewhere
down the line who, you know,

463
00:26:12,983 --> 00:26:14,503
conjured something
in your imagination.

464
00:26:14,528 --> 00:26:16,763
Someone you aspire to be yourself.

465
00:26:16,898 --> 00:26:18,522
So, who was that?

466
00:26:18,657 --> 00:26:20,032
Sarah Chang.

467
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:21,935
So you're a violinist?

468
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,704
- Yeah.
- All right, okay.

469
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,306
Well, I can see why

470
00:26:25,441 --> 00:26:28,034
you would choose to conduct
a piece like this.

471
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,443
Must be a familiar pleasure
in presiding over

472
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:33,277
a bed of strings that behave
as if they're tuning.

473
00:26:33,412 --> 00:26:35,245
Now...

474
00:26:35,381 --> 00:26:39,879
this piece is very au courant.

475
00:26:40,014 --> 00:26:42,388
I mean, here,
the composer tells us

476
00:26:42,523 --> 00:26:44,557
to begin with "back-and-forth
tremolo strokes"

477
00:26:44,693 --> 00:26:48,593
with wire brush and slowly
sliding crotales over skin."

478
00:26:48,728 --> 00:26:51,159
Sounds like René Redzepi's
recipe for reindeer.

479
00:26:52,896 --> 00:26:55,560
It's exciting to play
new music, isn't it?

480
00:26:55,696 --> 00:26:56,898
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

481
00:26:57,033 --> 00:27:00,373
Great. All right, please,
join the other fellows.

482
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:05,169
Now, I know you're all
conducting students

483
00:27:05,304 --> 00:27:07,948
of Mr. Wolfe's,
but how many of you

484
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:11,147
are also studying composition?

485
00:27:11,283 --> 00:27:12,752
Right, what's your name?

486
00:27:12,887 --> 00:27:14,183
Olive Kerr.

487
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,754
All right, Olive.

488
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,254
What do you make of what
we've just been listening to?

489
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,261
It's pretty awesome.

490
00:27:21,397 --> 00:27:24,328
I mean, there's incredible
atonal tension.

491
00:27:24,463 --> 00:27:26,665
I agree about the tension part.

492
00:27:26,801 --> 00:27:30,535
Now, you can intellectually
contemplate, or masturbate,

493
00:27:30,671 --> 00:27:34,464
about the felicity
of the so-called "atonal,"

494
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:40,143
but the important question here
is: What are you conducting?

495
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,443
What is the effect?

496
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:44,449
What is it actually doing to me?

497
00:27:44,585 --> 00:27:48,317
Good music can be
as ornate as a cathedral

498
00:27:48,453 --> 00:27:50,557
or bare as a potting shed

499
00:27:50,693 --> 00:27:54,060
so long as it allows you to
answer both those questions.

500
00:27:54,195 --> 00:27:56,293
Max.

501
00:27:56,428 --> 00:27:58,761
Come on, what do you think?

502
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:06,472
When... Anna Thorvaldsdóttir
gave her master class,

503
00:28:06,608 --> 00:28:10,501
she said she was often
influenced by the form

504
00:28:10,636 --> 00:28:16,009
and structure of landscapes
and nature she grew up within.

505
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:18,384
But I'm not sure
she was interested per se

506
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,713
in describing
those actual sounds.

507
00:28:21,849 --> 00:28:24,391
Very<i> Punkt Kontra Punkt.</i>

508
00:28:25,618 --> 00:28:27,023
Yes.

509
00:28:27,158 --> 00:28:31,829
The intent of her composition
is vague, to say the least.

510
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:36,731
So, if her intent is vague,
how do you, as a conductor,

511
00:28:36,867 --> 00:28:40,335
have a point of view
about anything?

512
00:28:40,471 --> 00:28:41,904
Now, to be fair, I mean,

513
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:44,435
there are times when you will
simply have no choice.

514
00:28:44,571 --> 00:28:46,943
And you will be made to stand
in front of an orchestra

515
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:50,247
and pretend that there are
these invisible structures.

516
00:28:50,382 --> 00:28:53,343
But my prayer for you

517
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:55,554
is that you will be spared
the embarrassment

518
00:28:55,689 --> 00:28:57,852
of standing on the podium
with a 4'33",

519
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:00,520
trying to sell a car
without an engine.

520
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:02,854
Because now, my friends,

521
00:29:02,989 --> 00:29:06,059
now is the time to conduct music

522
00:29:06,194 --> 00:29:09,402
that actually requires
something of you.

523
00:29:09,537 --> 00:29:11,033
You know,
music that everybody knows

524
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:15,704
but will hear differently
when you interpret it for them.

525
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:19,571
For instance, Max,
why not a Kyrie?

526
00:29:19,706 --> 00:29:24,775
You know, like something
like Bach's<i> Mass in B minor.</i>

527
00:29:26,452 --> 00:29:28,287
I'm not really into Bach.

528
00:29:28,422 --> 00:29:31,053
You're not into Bach?

529
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:32,988
Oh, Max.

530
00:29:33,891 --> 00:29:35,992
Have you read
the Schweitzer book?

531
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,755
No.

532
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,229
Well, you should.

533
00:29:39,365 --> 00:29:41,563
It's an important text.

534
00:29:41,699 --> 00:29:43,967
Now, Antonia Brico thought so.

535
00:29:44,103 --> 00:29:46,904
So much so that she shipped
herself to Equatorial Africa

536
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,740
and canoed up the Congo River
to track Schweitzer down

537
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:52,908
and ask him to teach her
what he knew about Bach.

538
00:29:53,044 --> 00:29:54,915
I mean, somewhere,
I've got a picture of her

539
00:29:55,051 --> 00:29:57,148
in a, in a pith helmet.

540
00:29:57,284 --> 00:29:58,617
I mean, have you...

541
00:29:58,752 --> 00:30:02,654
have you ever played
or-or conducted Bach?

542
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:08,328
Honestly, as a BIPOC,
pangender person,

543
00:30:08,464 --> 00:30:10,264
I would say Bach's
misogynistic life

544
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,265
makes it kind of impossible
for me

545
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,799
to take his music seriously.

546
00:30:17,235 --> 00:30:18,836
Come on.

547
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:21,803
What do... what do...
what do you mean by that?

548
00:30:21,939 --> 00:30:25,979
Well, didn't he sire,
like, 20 kids?

549
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,141
Yes, that's documented.

550
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:31,714
Along with a considerable
amount of music.

551
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,314
But I'm sorry,
I'm... I'm unclear

552
00:30:34,449 --> 00:30:36,957
as to what his prodigious
skills in the marital bed

553
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:40,123
have to do with B minor.

554
00:30:40,258 --> 00:30:41,562
Sure.

555
00:30:41,697 --> 00:30:44,455
All right, whatever.
That's-that's your choice.

556
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,326
I mean, after all, "a soul
selects her own society."

557
00:30:47,461 --> 00:30:50,162
But remember, the flip side
of that selection

558
00:30:50,298 --> 00:30:52,967
closes the valves
of one's attention.

559
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:57,468
Now, of course,
siloing what is acceptable

560
00:30:57,603 --> 00:31:00,678
or not acceptable
is a basic construct of many,

561
00:31:00,814 --> 00:31:03,317
if not most,
symphony orchestras today,

562
00:31:03,452 --> 00:31:05,217
who see it
as their imperial right

563
00:31:05,353 --> 00:31:06,977
to curate for the cretins.

564
00:31:07,112 --> 00:31:08,820
So, slippery as it is,

565
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:12,659
there is some merit
in examining Max's allergy.

566
00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:15,893
Can classical music
written by a bunch of straight,

567
00:31:16,028 --> 00:31:19,324
Austro-German, churchgoing
white guys exalt us,

568
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:21,700
individually
as-as well as collectively,

569
00:31:21,835 --> 00:31:25,836
and who, may I ask,
gets to decide that?

570
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:29,206
You know, what about Beethoven?

571
00:31:29,342 --> 00:31:31,169
You into him?

572
00:31:31,305 --> 00:31:33,843
Because for me,
as a U-Haul lesbian,

573
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:37,210
I'm... I'm not too sure
about old Ludwig.

574
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:41,584
But then, I face him.

575
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,853
And I find myself nose-to-nose

576
00:31:43,988 --> 00:31:48,562
with his magnitude
and inevitability.

577
00:31:50,728 --> 00:31:53,695
Come on, Max. Indulge me.

578
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:57,201
Let's allow Bach a similar gaze.

579
00:32:01,944 --> 00:32:03,511
Sit.

580
00:32:06,338 --> 00:32:09,045
Now, this is all
filigree, right?

581
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:13,884
I mean, it could be
a first-year piano student.

582
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:18,691
♪ Or Schroeder playing
for Lucy. ♪

583
00:32:20,593 --> 00:32:23,025
Or Glenn Gould, for that matter.

584
00:32:27,603 --> 00:32:30,098
Now, it's not until
it changes...

585
00:32:31,296 --> 00:32:32,602
when you get inside it,

586
00:32:32,737 --> 00:32:34,238
that you hear what it really is.

587
00:32:34,373 --> 00:32:36,071
It's a question.

588
00:32:38,477 --> 00:32:40,581
And an answer.

589
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:44,816
Which begs another question.

590
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:49,085
There's a humility in Bach.

591
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:53,022
He's not pretending
he's certain about anything.

592
00:32:53,157 --> 00:32:56,186
'Cause he knows
that it's always the question

593
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:59,266
that involves the listener.

594
00:32:59,402 --> 00:33:02,359
It's never the answer, right?

595
00:33:02,495 --> 00:33:05,868
Now, the big question
for you is:

596
00:33:06,004 --> 00:33:08,576
What do you think, Max?

597
00:33:14,415 --> 00:33:16,279
You play really well.

598
00:33:16,415 --> 00:33:22,555
But nowadays, white, male, cis
composers, just not my thing.

599
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:26,823
Don't be so eager
to be offended.

600
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:28,990
The narcissism
of small differences

601
00:33:29,126 --> 00:33:31,794
leads to the most boring
conformity.

602
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:33,828
I guess Edgard Varèse is okay.

603
00:33:33,963 --> 00:33:35,802
I mean, I like "Arcana," anyway.

604
00:33:35,937 --> 00:33:38,833
Well, then you must be
aware that Varèse

605
00:33:38,969 --> 00:33:41,136
once famously stated that jazz

606
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:45,636
was "a Negro product
exploited by the Jews."

607
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:48,307
Didn't stop Jerry Goldsmith
from ripping him off

608
00:33:48,442 --> 00:33:50,475
for his
<i>Planet of the Apes</i> score.

609
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,917
It's kind of a perfect insult,
don't you think?

610
00:33:53,053 --> 00:33:56,689
But you see, the problem
with enrolling yourself

611
00:33:56,824 --> 00:33:59,189
as an ultrasonic epistemic
dissident

612
00:33:59,325 --> 00:34:02,894
is that if Bach's talent
can be reduced to his gender,

613
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:06,166
birth country, religion,
sexuality, and so on,

614
00:34:06,301 --> 00:34:08,769
then so can yours.

615
00:34:08,904 --> 00:34:12,168
Now, someday, Max,
when you go out into the world

616
00:34:12,304 --> 00:34:15,942
and you guest conduct
for a major or minor orchestra,

617
00:34:16,078 --> 00:34:19,103
you may notice that the players
have more than light bulbs

618
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,605
and music on their stands.

619
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,782
They will also have been
handed rating sheets,

620
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:27,782
the purpose of which
is to rate you.

621
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,119
Now, what kind of criteria

622
00:34:30,254 --> 00:34:32,850
would you hope that they would
use to do this?

623
00:34:32,985 --> 00:34:36,224
Your score reading and stick
technique, or something else?

624
00:34:39,098 --> 00:34:42,567
All right, everyone,
using Max's criteria,

625
00:34:42,702 --> 00:34:45,364
let's consider Max's thing.

626
00:34:45,499 --> 00:34:48,038
In this case,
Anna Thorvaldsdóttir.

627
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:51,809
Now, can we agree on two pieces
of observation?

628
00:34:51,945 --> 00:34:54,539
One, that Anna was born
in Iceland.

629
00:34:54,674 --> 00:34:56,883
And two, that she is,
in a, I don't know,

630
00:34:57,018 --> 00:34:59,416
Waldorf teacher kinda way,
a superhot young woman.

631
00:34:59,552 --> 00:35:01,445
Show of hands.

632
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,621
All right,
now let's turn our gaze

633
00:35:03,756 --> 00:35:05,715
back to the piano bench up there

634
00:35:05,851 --> 00:35:08,962
and see if we can square
how any of those things

635
00:35:09,098 --> 00:35:13,298
possibly relate to the person
we see seated before us.

636
00:35:18,231 --> 00:35:19,971
Where are you going?

637
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,068
You're a fucking bitch.

638
00:35:26,547 --> 00:35:28,607
And you are a robot.

639
00:35:28,742 --> 00:35:31,242
I mean, unfortunately,
the architect of your soul

640
00:35:31,377 --> 00:35:33,911
appears to be social media.

641
00:35:34,046 --> 00:35:37,248
You want to dance the mask,
you must service the composer.

642
00:35:37,384 --> 00:35:38,592
You gotta sublimate yourself,

643
00:35:38,727 --> 00:35:41,455
your ego, and, yes,
your identity.

644
00:35:41,591 --> 00:35:44,264
You must, in fact, stand
in front of the public and God

645
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,064
and obliterate yourself.

646
00:35:49,262 --> 00:35:50,937
All right.

647
00:35:51,073 --> 00:35:52,597
During the lockdown,

648
00:35:52,732 --> 00:35:54,802
you did something
I thought remarkable.

649
00:35:54,938 --> 00:35:56,602
You made music for free.

650
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:59,303
Anyone at all could stream
Berlin performances

651
00:35:59,438 --> 00:36:01,680
without ever paying a dime.

652
00:36:01,816 --> 00:36:03,807
Well, that-that was a...

653
00:36:03,942 --> 00:36:07,020
it's a democratically made
decision by the players.

654
00:36:07,155 --> 00:36:11,222
And though I wish I could
claim the idea was mine,

655
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:14,825
it really did spring from
the heart of Sharon Goodnow.

656
00:36:14,961 --> 00:36:16,396
Sharon is your partner.

657
00:36:16,532 --> 00:36:17,721
You have a child together,

658
00:36:17,857 --> 00:36:20,294
and she's also the
concertmaster for Berlin.

659
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,469
- Does that ever...
- Yes, that's right.

660
00:36:22,605 --> 00:36:24,070
Complicate things for you?

661
00:36:24,206 --> 00:36:26,406
Your work getting into your
home or the other way ar...?

662
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:41,316
Jake said he was certain

663
00:36:41,451 --> 00:36:43,323
you'd be happy with the drape
of the seat.

664
00:36:43,459 --> 00:36:44,815
I will be...

665
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:47,155
if I can keep the fat off
until next month.

666
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:50,127
You never gain weight.

667
00:36:53,636 --> 00:36:55,694
Your... your mother texted me.

668
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:58,229
She knows you're busy
but is hoping to drop by.

669
00:36:59,671 --> 00:37:01,169
Next trip.

670
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:03,538
What are you thinking
for dinner?

671
00:37:03,674 --> 00:37:05,210
No.

672
00:37:05,346 --> 00:37:08,080
No, I'm-I'm gonna stay in
and put this piano to good use.

673
00:37:08,215 --> 00:37:11,842
I'm suspicious of the E natural
in the cello line.

674
00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:15,178
Doesn't it sound like
warmed-over Charles Ives to you?

675
00:37:15,313 --> 00:37:16,921
Not-not at all.

676
00:37:17,056 --> 00:37:18,919
But don't worry,
I'll call Houston.

677
00:37:19,055 --> 00:37:20,355
They'll be flexible.

678
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:23,022
You must have
some New Haven friends

679
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,192
you want to see tonight?

680
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:27,466
No. Not really.

681
00:37:29,234 --> 00:37:32,363
Should I stop by later
for notes?

682
00:37:32,498 --> 00:37:34,369
No, that won't be necessary.

683
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:37,339
Okay.

684
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:45,083
I... I almost forgot, but...

685
00:37:45,218 --> 00:37:48,077
this was left for you
at the front desk.

686
00:37:48,213 --> 00:37:49,256
By who?

687
00:37:49,391 --> 00:37:51,248
They didn't say.

688
00:37:51,383 --> 00:37:53,082
Wh-What, no card?

689
00:37:53,218 --> 00:37:54,256
No.

690
00:37:54,392 --> 00:37:56,294
Okay, just, just leave it
over there.

691
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,495
Thanks.

692
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,572
Good night.

693
00:38:09,707 --> 00:38:11,241
Night.

694
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:20,745

And<i> I Eat Ears,</i>

700
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:32,766
- feeding the discerning listener since 2008.
- 2008.

701
00:38:32,902 --> 00:38:34,165
<i>- I Eat Ears,
- I Eat Ears,</i>

702
00:38:34,301 --> 00:38:36,530
- and you should, too.
- And you should, too.

703
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:40,671
And now, more from NPR.

704
00:38:40,807 --> 00:38:42,041
Over the next few weeks,

705
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:44,174
we'll be hearing poems
from four finalists

706
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:48,014
for the National
Youth Poet Laureate Award.

707
00:38:55,782 --> 00:38:58,021
When were you informed of this?

708
00:38:58,157 --> 00:39:00,793
Just this morning.

709
00:39:00,928 --> 00:39:03,023
Mr. Kaplan was very apologetic.

710
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:04,457
I was able to get us on

711
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:06,125
the 7:00 a.m. you like,
through Munich.

712
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,295
The connection's short,

713
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:09,459
but special services
are standing by.

714
00:39:09,595 --> 00:39:11,303
Where are things with DG?

715
00:39:11,439 --> 00:39:13,907
Please tell me they've finally
woken up to see the wisdom

716
00:39:14,043 --> 00:39:16,304
of honest-to-God LPs
for this release?

717
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,375
No movement there yet.

718
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,350
Have you looked at the email
I drafted for you?

719
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:21,542
Sent it last night.

720
00:39:21,677 --> 00:39:24,414
Well, just forward me their response.

721
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,483
What's your take
on<i> The New Yorker</i> talk?

722
00:39:29,856 --> 00:39:31,051
It went well, I thought.

723
00:39:31,187 --> 00:39:32,824
You're hedging.

724
00:39:34,353 --> 00:39:35,595
I was garrulous.

725
00:39:35,731 --> 00:39:36,929
No.

726
00:39:37,065 --> 00:39:38,994
No, not at all.
You, you were fabulous.

727
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,397
Francesca.

728
00:39:41,532 --> 00:39:44,070
If you have any real interest
in conducting,

729
00:39:44,205 --> 00:39:46,000
you need to be able
to speak your mind.

730
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:48,108
Okay. Perhaps you...

731
00:39:48,243 --> 00:39:50,543
You could've made less
of the relationship with...

732
00:39:50,678 --> 00:39:52,076
- Lenny?
- No.

733
00:39:52,212 --> 00:39:54,443
I was thinking
about Mahler and Alma's.

734
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:56,379
You implied
that she betrayed him.

735
00:39:56,481 --> 00:39:59,617
I'm not, I'm not sure
I agree with that.

736
00:39:59,752 --> 00:40:01,049
Oh, really?

737
00:40:01,185 --> 00:40:02,746
Alma was a composer, too,

738
00:40:02,882 --> 00:40:04,924
but he insisted
she stop writing music.

739
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,589
He said there was
only room for...

740
00:40:06,725 --> 00:40:09,085
- One asshole in the house?
- One asshole in the house. Yes.

741
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,688
And she agreed to those rules.

742
00:40:10,824 --> 00:40:12,927
No one made that decision
for her.

743
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:16,102
#RulesOfTheGame.

744
00:40:19,565 --> 00:40:22,009
Okay.

745
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,441
How was your evening?

746
00:40:30,576 --> 00:40:32,919
Yeah, was uneventful.

747
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,285
Are there any
of Sharon's pills left?

748
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,425
No, but Dr. Korovin
called these in.

749
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,061
Thanks.

750
00:40:48,368 --> 00:40:51,167
I received another weird email
from Krista.

751
00:40:51,302 --> 00:40:54,803
How should I reply?

752
00:40:54,938 --> 00:40:56,604
Don't.

753
00:40:58,213 --> 00:41:01,504
Well, this one felt
especially desperate.

754
00:43:01,998 --> 00:43:04,402
Do you have some kind
of profit-sharing deal

755
00:43:04,537 --> 00:43:06,969
with the utility company
that I am unaware of?

756
00:43:09,075 --> 00:43:11,535
The flutter's back.

757
00:43:11,671 --> 00:43:14,906
It's... It's racing.

758
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:17,211
I can't find my Metoprolol
anywhere.

759
00:43:21,749 --> 00:43:23,355
Oh, fuck.

760
00:43:35,194 --> 00:43:38,865
I found this
lying loose in the drawer.

761
00:43:41,272 --> 00:43:43,606
Is this the right one?

762
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:46,609
Yeah.

763
00:43:51,577 --> 00:43:53,550
Thank you.

764
00:43:56,715 --> 00:43:58,749
Is that a new bag?

765
00:43:58,884 --> 00:44:01,126
It's just a gift from Eliot.

766
00:44:01,261 --> 00:44:02,528
You want it?

767
00:44:02,664 --> 00:44:04,231
No.

768
00:44:05,294 --> 00:44:06,756
Suits you.

769
00:44:08,634 --> 00:44:14,340
Let's slow this down
to 60 beats a minute.

770
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:40,130
Actually, it's 64 beats.

771
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:47,807
Tried calling you
on your mobile last night.

772
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,372
And again at the hotel.

773
00:44:52,508 --> 00:44:54,941
Must've been asleep.

774
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,807
You never sleep that deeply.

775
00:44:57,943 --> 00:45:00,044
No, no, don't be a scold.

776
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,853
♪ Feelin' a feelin' ♪

777
00:45:04,956 --> 00:45:11,463
♪ For somethin' there ain't
too much of... ♪

778
00:45:12,231 --> 00:45:14,334
I'm worried about Petra.

779
00:45:16,669 --> 00:45:19,867
She's starting to disappear
into herself.

780
00:45:21,073 --> 00:45:22,870
Be specific.

781
00:45:25,844 --> 00:45:29,406
She keeps coming home
with bruises on her shins.

782
00:45:30,476 --> 00:45:33,683
And then when I ask her
about it, she gets quiet.

783
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:38,015
I mean, I hope
it's just playground football

784
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:40,850
and not some<i> Biodeutsche</i> thing.

785
00:45:40,986 --> 00:45:43,726
We talked about this.

786
00:45:44,994 --> 00:45:48,066
But maybe we just need
to put more effort

787
00:45:48,202 --> 00:45:51,036
into finding her a friend.

788
00:45:51,172 --> 00:45:52,868
Last year was really hard

789
00:45:53,004 --> 00:45:56,541
to be locked up alone
with two old ladies like us.

790
00:46:00,181 --> 00:46:02,910
She's old enough to learn piano.

791
00:46:04,842 --> 00:46:06,683
I'll teach her.

792
00:46:11,353 --> 00:46:13,420
Yeah.

793
00:46:13,556 --> 00:46:16,022
That might be good.

794
00:46:17,229 --> 00:46:19,465
How's your heart?

795
00:46:20,396 --> 00:46:22,633
Better now.

796
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:47,584
Knock, knock. Who's there?

797
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:50,091
Lenny?

798
00:46:50,227 --> 00:46:52,426
Walter?

799
00:46:52,561 --> 00:46:55,535
It's you, MTT.

800
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:58,599
Why do you insist on holding
things up like that?

801
00:46:58,734 --> 00:47:00,363
Your business here is rejoicing,

802
00:47:00,498 --> 00:47:03,973
not screaming
like a fucking porn star.

803
00:47:04,109 --> 00:47:06,110
Michael Tilson Thomas...

804
00:47:14,946 --> 00:47:16,918
Hello, Petra.

805
00:47:19,084 --> 00:47:21,923
Why are you lurking?

806
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:25,058
Tell me and I'll help.

807
00:47:25,794 --> 00:47:27,299
Sharon?

808
00:47:27,434 --> 00:47:29,660
I'm taking Petra to school.

809
00:47:29,795 --> 00:47:31,127
Okay.

810
00:47:31,262 --> 00:47:33,803
- Come on.
<i>- Tschüss.</i>

811
00:47:53,692 --> 00:47:56,490
Who'll bear the pall?

812
00:47:56,626 --> 00:47:58,355
"We," said the wren,

813
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:01,363
- "both the cock and the hen."
- The hen.

814
00:48:01,499 --> 00:48:03,269
"I'll..."

815
00:48:03,405 --> 00:48:05,598
"We'll bear the pall."

816
00:48:05,734 --> 00:48:07,430
And who'll sing a psalm?

817
00:48:07,565 --> 00:48:12,011
"I," said the thrush
as she sat on a bush.

818
00:48:12,147 --> 00:48:14,046
"I'll sing a song."

819
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,114
"Who'll toll the bell?"

820
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:17,511
"I," said the bull,

821
00:48:17,647 --> 00:48:20,118
"because I can pull.

822
00:48:20,254 --> 00:48:21,551
I'll toll the bell."

823
00:48:21,686 --> 00:48:24,388
All the birds of the air

824
00:48:24,523 --> 00:48:27,457
fell a-sighing and a-sobbing

825
00:48:27,593 --> 00:48:30,458
when they heard the bell toll

826
00:48:30,594 --> 00:48:34,666
for poor Cock Robin!

827
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:43,609
It's gonna be okay.

828
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:50,147
All right.
Okay, which one is she?

829
00:48:50,282 --> 00:48:52,519
The red one.

830
00:48:55,288 --> 00:48:57,216
- Bye.
- Go on.

831
00:49:08,293 --> 00:49:10,097
<i>Hallo,</i> Johanna.

832
00:50:04,359 --> 00:50:06,758
Hello. Hi.

833
00:50:13,434 --> 00:50:15,296
They're all in the chamber hall?

834
00:50:15,432 --> 00:50:17,166
Yes.

835
00:50:17,302 --> 00:50:19,606
No.

836
00:50:59,404 --> 00:51:01,846
Good morning.

837
00:51:02,878 --> 00:51:05,351
I'm sorry, Maestro.

838
00:51:05,486 --> 00:51:07,084
We weren't sure you were coming.

839
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:10,548
We were told there might
be a scheduling conflict.

840
00:51:10,683 --> 00:51:12,522
Would you like me to take notes?

841
00:51:12,658 --> 00:51:13,792
No, thank you, Sebastian.

842
00:51:13,928 --> 00:51:15,286
That won't be necessary.

843
00:51:15,422 --> 00:51:16,925
Do we all have
our rating sheets?

844
00:51:17,061 --> 00:51:18,798
We narrowed it down to three.

845
00:51:18,933 --> 00:51:21,190
So, unless anyone has
other business to discuss,

846
00:51:21,326 --> 00:51:23,230
let's bring in number one.

847
00:52:40,439 --> 00:52:42,979
Goossens stands, sounds his A.

848
00:52:43,115 --> 00:52:45,885
And of course Léon
was rather famous

849
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:50,187
for his rather wide vibrato?

850
00:52:50,323 --> 00:52:53,786
Beecham looks up and says,
"Gentlemen, take your pick."

851
00:52:56,695 --> 00:52:58,622
How's the writing going?

852
00:52:58,757 --> 00:53:01,858
I never know how
to answer that question.

853
00:53:01,994 --> 00:53:02,998
No.

854
00:53:03,134 --> 00:53:05,670
Makes it sound like
a physical act.

855
00:53:05,805 --> 00:53:07,635
Like, how's the shitting going?

856
00:53:09,474 --> 00:53:10,640
Okay.

857
00:53:10,776 --> 00:53:12,641
How's the thinking going?

858
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:15,012
Yeah, not so well.

859
00:53:15,147 --> 00:53:17,650
I keep hearing something
and getting excited

860
00:53:17,786 --> 00:53:21,218
only to catch myself
in pastiche.

861
00:53:22,853 --> 00:53:24,987
It's all pastiche.

862
00:53:25,123 --> 00:53:27,493
We all have the same
musical grammar.

863
00:53:27,628 --> 00:53:30,327
Just look at Beethoven Five.

864
00:53:30,463 --> 00:53:33,527
The third movement's theme has
the same sequence of intervals

865
00:53:33,663 --> 00:53:37,231
as the opening theme of the
final movement of Mozart Forty.

866
00:53:37,366 --> 00:53:39,702
Th-that could've been
a coincidence.

867
00:53:39,837 --> 00:53:41,707
No. Not in this case.

868
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:44,534
If you examine
the sketchbooks he used,

869
00:53:44,669 --> 00:53:48,611
29 bars of Mozart's
finale appear.

870
00:53:48,747 --> 00:53:50,949
Copied out by Beethoven.

871
00:53:51,084 --> 00:53:55,182
Oh, my God. I find that
extremely depressing.

872
00:53:55,317 --> 00:53:57,016
I finished reading
your manuscript.

873
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:58,753
It's very good, Lydia.

874
00:53:58,888 --> 00:54:00,858
One for the ages.

875
00:54:00,994 --> 00:54:03,125
And, I dare say,
will be available

876
00:54:03,261 --> 00:54:04,793
long after my book
has been forgotten.

877
00:54:04,928 --> 00:54:06,428
Oh, yes, you're right.

878
00:54:06,563 --> 00:54:09,897
The entire first printing
will always be available.

879
00:54:10,032 --> 00:54:12,267
Too modest, as usual.

880
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:23,014
Thank you, Andris.

881
00:54:23,913 --> 00:54:25,713
I'll cherish this.

882
00:54:25,848 --> 00:54:27,915
You may use it.

883
00:54:28,051 --> 00:54:30,384
A blurb for the covers.

884
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:34,087
Oh, thank you.

885
00:54:34,223 --> 00:54:36,089
I'll send it to the publisher.

886
00:54:36,225 --> 00:54:38,092
Hopefully, there's still time.

887
00:54:38,227 --> 00:54:40,566
I'm proud to call you my pupil,

888
00:54:40,701 --> 00:54:41,981
even though there was really

889
00:54:42,032 --> 00:54:43,260
nothing I could teach you.

890
00:54:43,395 --> 00:54:44,697
Now, that's not true.

891
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:47,597
I'd never have the position
here were it not for you.

892
00:54:47,732 --> 00:54:49,969
Then you'd be in London,
New York.

893
00:54:50,105 --> 00:54:52,076
They're not Berlin.

894
00:54:53,213 --> 00:54:55,580
Besides, I'm not sure
what Sharon would do,

895
00:54:55,715 --> 00:54:56,847
were we ever to leave.

896
00:54:56,982 --> 00:54:58,683
She's so close with her family.

897
00:54:58,819 --> 00:55:02,252
Yeah, the Goodnow sisters.

898
00:55:02,388 --> 00:55:04,953
I remember the elder one
being an absolute ball-breaker

899
00:55:05,088 --> 00:55:08,026
while she still held sway at DG.

900
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:12,188
Heike is a woman of many opinions.

901
00:55:12,323 --> 00:55:13,323
And that voice.

902
00:55:13,395 --> 00:55:14,715
I mean, the signal-to-noise
ratio,

903
00:55:14,825 --> 00:55:16,936
it's unbearable.

904
00:55:17,071 --> 00:55:19,097
I've had to bolt-hole
at my old place in town

905
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:21,765
to get any writing done.

906
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,540
Schopenhauer measured
a man's intelligence

907
00:55:23,565 --> 00:55:25,735
against his sensitivity
to noise.

908
00:55:27,139 --> 00:55:29,943
Didn't he once also throw
a woman down a flight of stairs

909
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,550
who later sued him?

910
00:55:31,686 --> 00:55:32,782
Yes.

911
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:34,314
Although, it's unclear

912
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:35,952
this private
and personal failing

913
00:55:36,087 --> 00:55:38,720
is at all relevant to his work.

914
00:55:46,423 --> 00:55:48,357
You're late.

915
00:55:49,935 --> 00:55:50,967
Here, give me your stick.

916
00:55:51,102 --> 00:55:52,735
- Thank you.
- I've got it.

917
00:59:39,194 --> 00:59:41,497
Okay.

918
00:59:43,001 --> 00:59:44,131
<i>Gut, gut.</i>

919
00:59:47,331 --> 00:59:49,538
Christian...

920
00:59:53,614 --> 00:59:54,977
Okay?

921
00:59:55,113 --> 00:59:57,112
But it's also...

922
00:59:57,248 --> 00:59:58,314
It's like we're hearing it

923
00:59:58,449 --> 01:00:00,950
from a very, very great
distance.

924
01:00:01,086 --> 01:00:06,548
So it's...

925
01:00:06,683 --> 01:00:07,783
Ju...

926
01:00:07,918 --> 01:00:09,289
Sorry.<i> Ist</i> Harald da?

927
01:00:12,224 --> 01:00:14,231
Harald? I was just wondering
if you might

928
01:00:14,367 --> 01:00:16,928
quickly rig something up for us?

929
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:49,925
<i>Gut, gut, gut.</i>

930
01:00:50,061 --> 01:00:52,203
Harald?

931
01:00:52,339 --> 01:00:53,937
We'll want the same
backstage setup

932
01:00:54,073 --> 01:00:55,139
for the live recording.

933
01:00:55,274 --> 01:00:57,275
One, two, one.

934
01:01:24,834 --> 01:01:27,806
Okay? Looks great, but...

935
01:01:27,942 --> 01:01:29,064
we need to hear it.

936
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:31,843
Okay? It's not...

937
01:01:33,505 --> 01:01:34,505
Hey.

938
01:01:41,845 --> 01:01:43,150
<i>Ja?</i>

939
01:01:43,285 --> 01:01:45,621
Okay?

940
01:01:58,973 --> 01:02:00,838
No.

941
01:02:03,241 --> 01:02:04,805
It's-it's much too slow.

942
01:02:15,019 --> 01:02:17,085
Okay.

943
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:18,789
Okay, tutti.

944
01:02:22,427 --> 01:02:24,686
How are things feeling up here?

945
01:02:24,821 --> 01:02:25,921
Fine, yeah.

946
01:02:26,057 --> 01:02:27,532
Yeah, actually great, but

947
01:02:27,667 --> 01:02:29,863
it's a shame we don't record
this one direct-to-disk.

948
01:02:29,998 --> 01:02:32,899
It's criminal, is more like it.

949
01:02:34,097 --> 01:02:35,539
Will you shoot me the MP3s?

950
01:02:35,674 --> 01:02:37,576
Yeah, sure,
but don't you want WAV files?

951
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:41,045
No, just think what people
will actually be streaming.

952
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:42,379
What about video?

953
01:02:42,514 --> 01:02:44,281
Yes, yes. Stage left A camera.

954
01:02:44,417 --> 01:02:45,745
- Okay.
- All right. Thanks, guys.

955
01:02:45,881 --> 01:02:47,644
Okay. Bye. You're quite welcome.

956
01:02:49,851 --> 01:02:51,380
- There?
- Yeah.

957
01:02:51,487 --> 01:02:53,327
You want us to come,
to come in stronger there?

958
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:54,558
- Okay, then yeah.
- Yeah.

959
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:56,330
Here, 'cause the reigning
dynamic is forte,

960
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:57,624
which is not good.

961
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:59,389
Yeah?

962
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:02,461
Yeah. Just
one small thing, Maestro.

963
01:03:02,597 --> 01:03:05,394
During the scherzo

964
01:03:05,529 --> 01:03:08,506
th-th-the clarinet solo's
still a bit too loud.

965
01:03:08,641 --> 01:03:10,573
It should really be
an accompanying figure

966
01:03:10,709 --> 01:03:13,645
to the first violins.

967
01:03:13,781 --> 01:03:17,147
But apart from that, I'd say
we're in very good shape.

968
01:03:17,282 --> 01:03:19,017
Thank you, Sebastian.

969
01:03:19,153 --> 01:03:21,387
Thank you.

970
01:03:26,423 --> 01:03:27,992
Accurate assessment?

971
01:03:28,127 --> 01:03:29,827
I don't think so.

972
01:03:29,963 --> 01:03:33,255
The clarinet is marked piano,
and we are marked pianissimo.

973
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:35,160
Sebastian likes to sit
in the stalls,

974
01:03:35,295 --> 01:03:38,860
but there's no problem
with the balance in the circle.

975
01:03:43,475 --> 01:03:45,600
Something a bit more playful.

976
01:03:50,983 --> 01:03:53,217
And here's something
Tanya and I did with Gustavo.

977
01:03:53,352 --> 01:03:54,816
I think it's very powerful.

978
01:03:54,951 --> 01:03:57,280
Yes, it's-it's really wonderful
work Karl.

979
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:59,136
I'm just wondering
if we might try something

980
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:02,120
a little less considered.

981
01:04:04,759 --> 01:04:07,127
Something simple like this?

982
01:04:08,592 --> 01:04:10,962
I'm not sure how you would
want to light it.

983
01:04:11,098 --> 01:04:13,934
Have Harald dim
the houselights to half.

984
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:17,542
Houselights down half, please.

985
01:04:21,339 --> 01:04:22,876
I mean, we could make it work,

986
01:04:23,012 --> 01:04:24,806
but we'd have to bring in
some lights.

987
01:04:29,722 --> 01:04:31,422
If we want to do
something like this,

988
01:04:31,557 --> 01:04:33,558
we'll have to bring
the hot lights

989
01:04:33,694 --> 01:04:35,657
next week, Tanya...
Forget about the strobes.

990
01:04:38,828 --> 01:04:40,229
Thank you for waiting.

991
01:04:40,365 --> 01:04:41,829
Of course, Maestro.

992
01:04:41,965 --> 01:04:44,899
How are we feeling
about today's rehearsal?

993
01:04:45,034 --> 01:04:48,831
Well, Sebastian thinks
your solo in the scherzo

994
01:04:48,967 --> 01:04:50,942
is a bit loud.

995
01:04:51,078 --> 01:04:52,175
It's possible.

996
01:04:52,311 --> 01:04:54,043
I don't agree.

997
01:04:54,179 --> 01:04:57,345
Your dynamic marking is higher
than that of the first violin.

998
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,908
Yes, that's true.

999
01:04:59,043 --> 01:05:00,548
Look.

1000
01:05:00,684 --> 01:05:04,287
Sebastian's getting old, Knut.

1001
01:05:04,422 --> 01:05:06,052
I'm rotating him out.

1002
01:05:07,052 --> 01:05:09,088
You're the first to know.

1003
01:05:12,163 --> 01:05:14,533
Well...

1004
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:19,400
Then I will organize a caucus,
and we'll take a vote.

1005
01:05:19,535 --> 01:05:22,404
No. No, you won't.

1006
01:05:22,539 --> 01:05:24,872
A vote must be taken.

1007
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:27,041
I am familiar with
the electoral conclave.

1008
01:05:27,176 --> 01:05:29,311
But the appointment
of the assistant conductor

1009
01:05:29,447 --> 01:05:32,040
is entirely my decision.

1010
01:05:33,745 --> 01:05:34,916
Yes.

1011
01:05:35,052 --> 01:05:38,122
So, I can count on your
support with the others?

1012
01:05:40,191 --> 01:05:41,321
Yes.

1013
01:05:41,456 --> 01:05:42,722
Good.

1014
01:05:42,858 --> 01:05:44,086
Who will you replace him with?

1015
01:05:44,221 --> 01:05:45,928
I'm considering a few names,

1016
01:05:46,064 --> 01:05:49,234
but the main thing is we
proceed with this immediately.

1017
01:05:49,369 --> 01:05:51,560
I understand.

1018
01:05:51,695 --> 01:05:53,769
Maestro the other players
would like to know

1019
01:05:53,905 --> 01:05:55,425
if you have chosen
the companion piece.

1020
01:05:55,537 --> 01:05:57,543
<i>Ach!</i>

1021
01:05:59,446 --> 01:06:01,206
Okay.<i> Danke.</i>

1022
01:06:29,233 --> 01:06:31,305
- I...
- It's okay.

1023
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,106
<i>Danke.</i>

1024
01:06:58,802 --> 01:07:04,643
♪ Changing major to minor. ♪

1025
01:07:07,711 --> 01:07:09,978
I'm sorry, I knocked.

1026
01:07:11,315 --> 01:07:14,250
I knew you wanted your keys
back as quickly as possible.

1027
01:07:14,385 --> 01:07:15,551
Yes, thanks.

1028
01:07:15,687 --> 01:07:17,318
Did you use the company card?

1029
01:07:17,453 --> 01:07:18,488
Yeah.

1030
01:07:18,624 --> 01:07:19,986
We can use it for your...

1031
01:07:20,122 --> 01:07:22,155
your taxi home.

1032
01:07:26,465 --> 01:07:28,165
Yeah. It's all right.

1033
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:30,196
You can go.

1034
01:07:31,394 --> 01:07:34,871
It wasn't just the keys.

1035
01:07:37,576 --> 01:07:40,679
I need someone to hold me.

1036
01:07:42,581 --> 01:07:45,145
This isn't the place, Francesca.

1037
01:07:46,644 --> 01:07:48,878
You're... That's not about...

1038
01:07:50,256 --> 01:07:52,054
I just...

1039
01:07:52,189 --> 01:07:55,661
I just got this from someone
over at Accordion.

1040
01:08:07,503 --> 01:08:08,868
Oh, no.

1041
01:08:11,502 --> 01:08:13,245
When did this happen?

1042
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,340
Day before yesterday.

1043
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:20,383
That email she sent you,
it felt like she was already...

1044
01:08:20,519 --> 01:08:23,382
Delete it. And the rest.

1045
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:26,791
There's no reason to get
caught up in any intrigue.

1046
01:08:32,023 --> 01:08:33,765
Now, now.

1047
01:08:35,167 --> 01:08:40,096
Come on. There's nothing
we could have done to stop her.

1048
01:08:40,231 --> 01:08:42,570
She wasn't one of us.

1049
01:08:58,058 --> 01:09:01,589
I can't stop thinking about
our trip up the Ucayali.

1050
01:09:03,159 --> 01:09:05,094
- The three of us were so close.
- Yes.

1051
01:09:05,229 --> 01:09:08,734
But that was before
she started making demands.

1052
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:15,306
There was just something
not quite right about her.

1053
01:09:15,442 --> 01:09:18,042
She had so much promise.

1054
01:09:18,178 --> 01:09:19,835
She did.

1055
01:09:19,971 --> 01:09:21,643
Yes.

1056
01:09:21,778 --> 01:09:24,112
Almost as much as you.

1057
01:09:28,085 --> 01:09:31,350
Now, we have to forget
about her.

1058
01:09:34,921 --> 01:09:36,927
You understand?

1059
01:09:41,799 --> 01:09:43,934
Right?

1060
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:47,702
- I'm sorry.
- No.

1061
01:09:47,837 --> 01:09:49,297
I know you're working.

1062
01:09:50,839 --> 01:09:52,138
Your...

1063
01:09:52,273 --> 01:09:55,209
Your keys are on
the kitchen table.

1064
01:10:59,506 --> 01:11:01,378
She went straight to sleep.

1065
01:11:04,049 --> 01:11:06,445
Didn't even have
to hold her foot.

1066
01:11:11,123 --> 01:11:14,391
And she came home
in a much better mood.

1067
01:11:14,527 --> 01:11:16,261
Oh, attagirl.

1068
01:11:25,903 --> 01:11:27,768
Met the new cellist today.

1069
01:11:27,904 --> 01:11:30,473
What was that like?

1070
01:11:30,609 --> 01:11:32,770
Olga Metkina.

1071
01:11:32,906 --> 01:11:34,576
Russian.

1072
01:11:34,712 --> 01:11:36,610
Strong player.

1073
01:11:36,745 --> 01:11:38,915
Good.

1074
01:11:39,051 --> 01:11:42,080
Her facial posture
is a bit much.

1075
01:11:42,216 --> 01:11:43,585
How so?

1076
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:45,154
Her legato.

1077
01:11:45,289 --> 01:11:47,622
Looks like she's on
the verge of climaxing.

1078
01:11:52,059 --> 01:11:54,323
She is young.

1079
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:56,231
So you've met her.

1080
01:11:58,228 --> 01:11:59,760
No, no.

1081
01:11:59,896 --> 01:12:02,137
Francesca mentioned something.

1082
01:12:02,272 --> 01:12:05,108
I think she's arranging
a welcome lunch.

1083
01:12:07,341 --> 01:12:10,010
You may want to hold off
on that.

1084
01:12:10,146 --> 01:12:13,083
Her invitation is conditional.

1085
01:12:15,985 --> 01:12:18,552
You have reservations?

1086
01:12:18,688 --> 01:12:20,523
No.

1087
01:12:20,658 --> 01:12:22,990
Not really.

1088
01:12:23,126 --> 01:12:25,931
We need to see if she fits in.

1089
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:31,937
Did you take your pill?

1090
01:12:32,768 --> 01:12:35,134
No.

1091
01:12:35,269 --> 01:12:38,273
Thank you for reminding me.

1092
01:14:05,623 --> 01:14:07,796
How was Johanna yesterday?

1093
01:14:07,932 --> 01:14:10,559
She stays away now.

1094
01:14:10,694 --> 01:14:12,763
You let me know if that changes.

1095
01:14:16,036 --> 01:14:19,737
Petra, last night, you weren't,
by any chance, in my study?

1096
01:14:20,872 --> 01:14:22,411
- No, Lydia.
- Because you do know

1097
01:14:22,546 --> 01:14:24,744
you're not supposed to be
in there without me.

1098
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,414
I know.

1099
01:14:28,251 --> 01:14:30,220
That's right.

1100
01:15:03,523 --> 01:15:05,256
S...

1101
01:15:06,092 --> 01:15:07,288
It's not so simple.

1102
01:15:07,424 --> 01:15:08,890
It's got...
it's got to be messier.

1103
01:15:13,489 --> 01:15:14,722
Okay?

1104
01:15:23,304 --> 01:15:25,808
A lot of pressure. Okay?

1105
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,079
Okay?

1106
01:15:30,214 --> 01:15:31,812
S-So familiar to everyone here.

1107
01:15:31,948 --> 01:15:35,120
It really doesn't help you to
know this piece so well. Okay.

1108
01:15:36,183 --> 01:15:38,156
Same place.

1109
01:16:07,048 --> 01:16:08,448
Please.

1110
01:16:08,584 --> 01:16:10,852
Please, please, please.

1111
01:16:10,987 --> 01:16:13,191
You must watch.

1112
01:16:17,487 --> 01:16:18,960
Okay?

1113
01:16:19,096 --> 01:16:20,295
It's got to be like

1114
01:16:20,431 --> 01:16:23,861
just one person
singing their heart out.

1115
01:16:26,166 --> 01:16:28,464
And...

1116
01:16:34,174 --> 01:16:35,704
Okay.

1117
01:16:44,186 --> 01:16:45,718
Okay.

1118
01:16:48,392 --> 01:16:50,595
Maestro.

1119
01:16:50,730 --> 01:16:51,790
What a surprise.

1120
01:16:51,925 --> 01:16:53,722
I was just having a spot of lunch.

1121
01:16:53,857 --> 01:16:55,066
C-Can I offer you anything?

1122
01:16:55,202 --> 01:16:56,731
No, thank you.

1123
01:16:56,867 --> 01:16:59,569
- Well, some tea, perhaps?
- No, thank you, Sebastian.

1124
01:17:00,572 --> 01:17:03,268
You know, I forget sometimes
just how impressive

1125
01:17:03,404 --> 01:17:05,105
your collection is here.

1126
01:17:05,241 --> 01:17:07,306
Is that Kalinnikov?

1127
01:17:07,442 --> 01:17:08,911
Yes.

1128
01:17:09,047 --> 01:17:11,015
Isn't he marvelous?

1129
01:17:11,151 --> 01:17:14,184
He belongs in a museum.

1130
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,649
I rescued him
for a hundred rubles

1131
01:17:16,785 --> 01:17:19,188
from a Kyiv street fair back in '90.

1132
01:17:19,323 --> 01:17:21,182
Right after the Wall came down.

1133
01:17:21,317 --> 01:17:23,492
That must really
have been something.

1134
01:17:23,627 --> 01:17:26,626
Incredible to have
lived through it.

1135
01:17:26,762 --> 01:17:29,190
I'd only just arrived here
with Andris,

1136
01:17:29,325 --> 01:17:32,636
and suddenly the impossible
was possible.

1137
01:17:32,771 --> 01:17:34,338
Yeah.

1138
01:17:35,569 --> 01:17:38,032
I'd like to talk about that.

1139
01:17:38,168 --> 01:17:39,943
- The reunification?
- No, no.

1140
01:17:40,078 --> 01:17:42,045
But please, sit down.

1141
01:17:42,181 --> 01:17:45,282
No about the possibility

1142
01:17:45,418 --> 01:17:48,944
of you fronting
a subscription orchestra.

1143
01:17:49,079 --> 01:17:50,218
But I already do.

1144
01:17:50,354 --> 01:17:52,983
Yes, but not as Kapellmeister.

1145
01:17:54,327 --> 01:17:57,658
If not now,
then when, Sebastian?

1146
01:17:59,031 --> 01:18:00,492
You mean leave Berlin?

1147
01:18:00,627 --> 01:18:03,801
Well, rotate somewhere, yes.

1148
01:18:03,937 --> 01:18:06,036
But this is my home.

1149
01:18:06,171 --> 01:18:09,237
Our only home is the podium.

1150
01:18:09,373 --> 01:18:11,800
We all live out of a suitcase.

1151
01:18:11,935 --> 01:18:13,938
You know that as well as anyone.

1152
01:18:20,118 --> 01:18:22,820
Just think about it.

1153
01:18:22,956 --> 01:18:25,246
Take your time.

1154
01:18:25,381 --> 01:18:28,458
It's not something
we need to decide now.

1155
01:18:31,195 --> 01:18:32,820
It's the girl, isn't it?

1156
01:18:32,955 --> 01:18:34,359
I'm sorry, what girl?

1157
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:36,899
Y-You're not asking.

1158
01:18:37,034 --> 01:18:38,735
You're telling.

1159
01:18:38,871 --> 01:18:43,374
I knew as soon as she showed up
that my days here were numbered.

1160
01:18:43,509 --> 01:18:46,073
Andris told me not to worry,
but...

1161
01:18:46,208 --> 01:18:47,709
I knew.

1162
01:18:47,844 --> 01:18:51,540
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

1163
01:18:51,675 --> 01:18:52,711
Please.

1164
01:18:52,847 --> 01:18:54,952
Just because
nobody dares breathe it.

1165
01:18:55,088 --> 01:18:57,087
We know the things you do.

1166
01:18:57,222 --> 01:19:00,053
The little favors you grant.

1167
01:19:00,188 --> 01:19:01,524
I'm...

1168
01:19:01,659 --> 01:19:04,885
I really don't know
what to say, Sebastian.

1169
01:19:05,021 --> 01:19:07,255
I mean, you of all people

1170
01:19:07,391 --> 01:19:09,431
have the temerity
to question my integrity?

1171
01:19:09,566 --> 01:19:11,027
No, no.
I-I'm-I'm sorry, Maestro.

1172
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:12,702
I don't, I don't know
what I'm saying.

1173
01:19:12,838 --> 01:19:15,396
No, no, no, it's clear you know
exactly what you're saying.

1174
01:19:15,531 --> 01:19:17,538
I mean, if that's how
you really feel about me,

1175
01:19:17,674 --> 01:19:19,406
then wouldn't you say
that staying is

1176
01:19:19,542 --> 01:19:20,707
entirely out of the question?

1177
01:19:20,843 --> 01:19:22,803
No, no, please, Maestro.
Please forgive me.

1178
01:19:22,938 --> 01:19:24,372
For what?

1179
01:19:24,508 --> 01:19:27,746
Your obsequiousness,
your hypocrisy, your misogamy?

1180
01:19:27,882 --> 01:19:30,988
- I'm not a misogynist!
- Misogamy.

1181
01:19:31,124 --> 01:19:33,523
It's a hatred of marriage.

1182
01:19:35,185 --> 01:19:38,057
Andris is still
very much married.

1183
01:19:39,227 --> 01:19:44,060
And you occupy an apartment
on the same floor, don't you?

1184
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:47,595
I just don't like
what he's implying.

1185
01:19:48,465 --> 01:19:51,565
It could lead to more than
Chinese whispers.

1186
01:19:51,701 --> 01:19:53,177
I know.

1187
01:19:53,312 --> 01:19:54,674
We barely survived<i> Der Spiegel</i>

1188
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:57,074
when you and I
came out together.

1189
01:19:58,651 --> 01:20:02,915
But with Francesca, no one
could point their finger.

1190
01:20:03,051 --> 01:20:05,417
It's not like you two are
in a relationship.

1191
01:20:05,552 --> 01:20:07,017
Yeah, that's true.

1192
01:20:07,152 --> 01:20:09,350
I just...
Turns my stomach to think

1193
01:20:09,486 --> 01:20:12,089
the old robot will be right
about something.

1194
01:20:13,732 --> 01:20:17,633
He's probably already run
to Andris.

1195
01:20:17,768 --> 01:20:21,204
Well, is there someone
other than Francesca

1196
01:20:21,339 --> 01:20:23,606
you feel is more qualified?

1197
01:20:26,412 --> 01:20:28,908
There are others
equal to the task.

1198
01:20:33,581 --> 01:20:35,849
Maybe wait to decide.

1199
01:20:45,098 --> 01:20:46,731
Where are we at with DG?

1200
01:20:46,866 --> 01:20:50,391
I spoke to an assistant
in Boyd Muir's office...

1201
01:20:50,526 --> 01:20:52,997
Who said they weren't sure
why they decided

1202
01:20:53,133 --> 01:20:56,802
on a digital-only set,
what the criteria were.

1203
01:20:56,938 --> 01:20:58,672
But I do know they just did

1204
01:20:58,808 --> 01:21:00,340
a full-vinyl pressing
for Long Yu.

1205
01:21:00,476 --> 01:21:02,146
Of course they did.

1206
01:21:02,281 --> 01:21:04,378
The Chinese market's incredible.

1207
01:21:04,513 --> 01:21:06,381
All right. Gloves off.

1208
01:21:06,517 --> 01:21:07,976
I'm going straight to Lucian.

1209
01:21:08,111 --> 01:21:09,391
Maybe he needs to be reminded of

1210
01:21:09,445 --> 01:21:11,086
his Annenberg
Inclusion Initiative.

1211
01:21:12,823 --> 01:21:14,314
You've got
his contact details, right?

1212
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:17,627
I'll send it to you right now.

1213
01:21:18,696 --> 01:21:22,694
My machine's misbehaving again.

1214
01:21:22,829 --> 01:21:24,663
I've already spoken to I.T.

1215
01:21:24,798 --> 01:21:27,065
Just here... let me borrow yours.

1216
01:21:34,211 --> 01:21:36,008
Thank you.

1217
01:21:39,152 --> 01:21:40,881
Where's the matcha?

1218
01:22:25,454 --> 01:22:27,295
I wasn't sure where you were.

1219
01:22:27,431 --> 01:22:29,061
Was working out a kink.

1220
01:22:29,196 --> 01:22:31,500
The-the matcha's cold.
I-I'll get another.

1221
01:22:31,636 --> 01:22:32,927
It's all right. I don't need it.

1222
01:22:33,063 --> 01:22:35,133
Let's just keep working.

1223
01:22:42,481 --> 01:22:44,572
Francesca, you did as I asked

1224
01:22:44,707 --> 01:22:48,247
and deleted any and all
correspondence with Krista,

1225
01:22:48,383 --> 01:22:50,049
correct?

1226
01:22:51,652 --> 01:22:54,757
I'm not sure.

1227
01:22:55,724 --> 01:22:57,325
I'm... I'm not sure.

1228
01:22:57,461 --> 01:22:59,762
I-I'll double-check.

1229
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:09,636
You know,
Sebastian's leaving us,

1230
01:23:09,771 --> 01:23:11,432
and I wondered if you might

1231
01:23:11,567 --> 01:23:15,580
compile a list
of suitable replacements.

1232
01:23:20,148 --> 01:23:23,588
Of course, feel free
to add your own name.

1233
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:28,989
Thank you.

1234
01:23:30,257 --> 01:23:34,128
Your-your lunch
with the new cellist.

1235
01:23:35,494 --> 01:23:36,774
Meant to have you
reschedule that

1236
01:23:36,799 --> 01:23:38,465
'til after the orchestra votes.

1237
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,704
I'll text her now.

1238
01:23:42,472 --> 01:23:44,574
No, wait.

1239
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:47,407
Might as well
see what she's made of.

1240
01:23:55,816 --> 01:23:58,051
This food.

1241
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:03,684
The cucumber salad's very good.

1242
01:24:03,819 --> 01:24:05,691
It's kind of the only
real option in this place

1243
01:24:05,826 --> 01:24:07,329
if you're vegetarian.

1244
01:24:07,465 --> 01:24:09,165
Do you eat fish?

1245
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:11,130
Not really.

1246
01:24:13,805 --> 01:24:17,164
You know, we can go
somewhere else.

1247
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:18,833
L-Like the Store Kitchen.

1248
01:24:18,968 --> 01:24:22,336
I mean, it's... it's kind
of a silly tradition really

1249
01:24:22,471 --> 01:24:24,405
that new members
are brought here

1250
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:27,346
to sup with the ghosts
of the past.

1251
01:24:27,481 --> 01:24:30,382
I mean, at some point,
everyone from... from Napoleon

1252
01:24:30,518 --> 01:24:34,423
to Beethoven tucked in for
a meal at one of these tables.

1253
01:24:34,558 --> 01:24:36,754
Yes, and Clara Zetkin.

1254
01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:38,452
I wonder which one.

1255
01:24:38,588 --> 01:24:41,297
Who's that? It's a musician?

1256
01:24:41,433 --> 01:24:43,097
No. She helped found

1257
01:24:43,232 --> 01:24:46,097
Social Democratic
woman's movement in Germany

1258
01:24:46,233 --> 01:24:49,573
and KPD until
Hitler came to power

1259
01:24:49,708 --> 01:24:52,406
and she was exiled
to Soviet Union.

1260
01:24:52,542 --> 01:24:53,900
Clara Zetkin?

1261
01:24:54,036 --> 01:24:55,241
Yes.

1262
01:24:55,376 --> 01:24:57,711
Every March 8th, we place
flowers at her plaque

1263
01:24:57,846 --> 01:25:00,381
in Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

1264
01:25:00,517 --> 01:25:01,814
Her birthday?

1265
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:04,154
No, International Woman's Day.

1266
01:25:07,584 --> 01:25:09,958
Are you ready, Maestro?

1267
01:25:10,094 --> 01:25:14,424
- Yes...
- Yes, first shashlik, then veal.

1268
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:17,765
- For you?
- Cucumber salad.

1269
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:19,264
- Thank you.
- Good choice.

1270
01:25:22,538 --> 01:25:24,469
Some more bread?

1271
01:25:31,641 --> 01:25:33,247
It's good.
Would you like a bite?

1272
01:25:33,383 --> 01:25:35,108
Oh, no.

1273
01:25:35,244 --> 01:25:37,051
No. Thank you.

1274
01:25:38,052 --> 01:25:39,750
Have you lived in Berlin long?

1275
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:41,656
No, not at all.

1276
01:25:41,791 --> 01:25:43,189
I have friends in Wicker I visit

1277
01:25:43,324 --> 01:25:45,928
until I know decision of orchestra.

1278
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:48,598
Simonov will hold your place?

1279
01:25:48,734 --> 01:25:51,736
Yes, I think so. He is my uncle.

1280
01:25:54,402 --> 01:25:57,097
But my dream has always been
to play with Berlin.

1281
01:25:57,232 --> 01:25:59,133
Oh, me, too.

1282
01:25:59,269 --> 01:26:01,339
There's nowhere like it.

1283
01:26:05,017 --> 01:26:08,753
I imagine Rostropovich
is a hero of yours.

1284
01:26:09,754 --> 01:26:11,853
Well, of course, he was great.

1285
01:26:11,989 --> 01:26:14,023
We study him
at Moscow Conservatory,

1286
01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:18,320
but growing up, my favorite
is Jacqueline du Pré.

1287
01:26:18,455 --> 01:26:20,858
She made me want to play cello.

1288
01:26:20,994 --> 01:26:22,398
Which record was it?

1289
01:26:22,534 --> 01:26:25,125
Not record. YouTube.

1290
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:27,101
Elgar Concerto.

1291
01:26:28,836 --> 01:26:30,038
Oh, of course.

1292
01:26:30,173 --> 01:26:32,740
With Barenboim conducting
the London Phil.

1293
01:26:32,875 --> 01:26:35,677
I don't know who was conducting.

1294
01:26:35,812 --> 01:26:38,638
But she did something to me.

1295
01:26:38,774 --> 01:26:40,475
That's when I decide
to learn piece

1296
01:26:40,611 --> 01:26:42,983
and play it
with youth orchestra.

1297
01:26:43,119 --> 01:26:45,079
Quite a challenge.
How old were you?

1298
01:26:45,214 --> 01:26:46,956
Thirteen.

1299
01:26:49,957 --> 01:26:51,762
I'd love to hear it.

1300
01:26:51,897 --> 01:26:54,799
They make video.
I will text to you.

1301
01:30:02,851 --> 01:30:04,582
Beautiful.

1302
01:30:14,328 --> 01:30:17,195
Now just before we break,

1303
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:19,264
I know many of you are wondering

1304
01:30:19,399 --> 01:30:22,270
what the companion piece
will be.

1305
01:30:22,405 --> 01:30:24,899
And I have been
thinking quite a bit about it

1306
01:30:25,034 --> 01:30:26,868
and was wondering
if we could just take

1307
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:30,538
an informal poll about
possibly pairing the Five

1308
01:30:30,673 --> 01:30:33,545
with Elgar's Cello Concerto.

1309
01:30:59,541 --> 01:31:04,012
And given what
we've all been through,

1310
01:31:04,147 --> 01:31:05,743
what we're still going through,

1311
01:31:05,879 --> 01:31:10,417
and we're finally back
together as a family, I...

1312
01:31:11,584 --> 01:31:13,485
I feel that maybe the soloist

1313
01:31:13,621 --> 01:31:16,256
should come from
within our own ranks.

1314
01:31:16,391 --> 01:31:17,659
Yeah.

1315
01:31:19,228 --> 01:31:20,526
Good. Okay, good.

1316
01:31:20,662 --> 01:31:23,330
Just... Sorry.
One more question.

1317
01:31:23,466 --> 01:31:25,635
And this really is
just for you, Gosia.

1318
01:31:25,770 --> 01:31:27,269
I mean...

1319
01:31:27,405 --> 01:31:30,003
as a practical matter,
I mean, this would

1320
01:31:30,138 --> 01:31:32,167
normally fall to you.

1321
01:31:32,303 --> 01:31:34,945
But given how much is gonna be
asked of you with the Mahler,

1322
01:31:35,081 --> 01:31:36,813
I wondered if you'd be
at all bothered

1323
01:31:36,949 --> 01:31:39,578
if we were to hold auditions?

1324
01:31:48,359 --> 01:31:51,821
Well, that's a bit unorthodox.

1325
01:31:54,925 --> 01:31:57,891
But, in theory,
I have no objection.

1326
01:31:58,027 --> 01:31:59,366
My only hesitation
will depend on

1327
01:31:59,502 --> 01:32:00,982
when these auditions
might take place.

1328
01:32:01,105 --> 01:32:02,467
I wouldn't want them in any way

1329
01:32:02,602 --> 01:32:03,882
to interfere with
our sectionals.

1330
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,637
No, no, no. That's a good point.

1331
01:32:05,772 --> 01:32:07,306
I mean, it is gonna
have to be a...

1332
01:32:07,441 --> 01:32:08,841
It's gonna have to be a sprint.

1333
01:32:12,047 --> 01:32:13,810
How about Monday?

1334
01:32:17,854 --> 01:32:19,519
All right.

1335
01:32:22,785 --> 01:32:24,018
Okay, good.

1336
01:32:24,153 --> 01:32:27,157
Knut, would you assemble
a quorum for Monday?

1337
01:32:42,147 --> 01:32:44,340
Let me see what she says.

1338
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:46,381
Okay, I got, I gotta go.

1339
01:32:47,642 --> 01:32:49,343
Britta, hi.

1340
01:32:49,478 --> 01:32:50,349
Lydia.

1341
01:32:50,484 --> 01:32:52,179
Just caught the end.

1342
01:32:52,314 --> 01:32:54,197
What'd you think? How's it
how's it sounding?

1343
01:32:54,222 --> 01:32:56,390
It's fantastic.

1344
01:32:56,526 --> 01:32:58,719
I can't wait
until the live recording.

1345
01:32:58,855 --> 01:33:00,391
Yes, well.

1346
01:33:00,527 --> 01:33:02,964
I'll be happy when it's over.

1347
01:33:03,099 --> 01:33:04,731
It's always that way.

1348
01:33:04,867 --> 01:33:08,065
I know you're busy, and I don't
want to add to your load,

1349
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:10,135
but...

1350
01:33:10,271 --> 01:33:12,373
Andris Davis called.

1351
01:33:12,508 --> 01:33:15,712
Look, he's upset
I'm rotating Sebastian.

1352
01:33:15,848 --> 01:33:17,042
No, no, no, no, no.

1353
01:33:17,177 --> 01:33:18,378
Something else.

1354
01:33:18,513 --> 01:33:19,833
But you will please
let Laura know

1355
01:33:19,878 --> 01:33:21,518
as soon as you have chosen
his replacement

1356
01:33:21,543 --> 01:33:22,903
so she can prepare
a press release.

1357
01:33:22,979 --> 01:33:23,951
Yeah, of course.

1358
01:33:24,087 --> 01:33:25,751
So what did he want?

1359
01:33:25,886 --> 01:33:28,215
To complain about
the punctuality of a driver

1360
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:31,125
he seems to believe
the board supplies him with.

1361
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:33,287
Do you know anything about this?

1362
01:33:33,423 --> 01:33:34,595
Yes.

1363
01:33:34,730 --> 01:33:37,595
No, it's just... it's just
something I pay for.

1364
01:33:37,731 --> 01:33:40,300
Then why does he believe
it's the board?

1365
01:33:40,435 --> 01:33:43,663
Because he needs
to believe that.

1366
01:33:43,798 --> 01:33:45,474
H-He needs to b...

1367
01:33:45,609 --> 01:33:48,069
needs to believe he hasn't
been forgotten, Britta.

1368
01:33:48,204 --> 01:33:50,777
The academy
has von Karajan's name on it,

1369
01:33:50,913 --> 01:33:53,406
and there are love shrines
to Abbado all over this place.

1370
01:33:53,542 --> 01:33:57,819
But the name of Davis, it's
essentially nowhere to be seen.

1371
01:33:57,954 --> 01:33:59,445
All right.

1372
01:33:59,581 --> 01:34:02,956
Then perhaps Francesca could
have a word with the driver.

1373
01:34:03,091 --> 01:34:05,255
Of course.

1374
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:07,257
One other thing.

1375
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:09,094
It's unpleasant.

1376
01:34:09,229 --> 01:34:10,625
Is it?

1377
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:12,533
Operational shortfall?

1378
01:34:12,668 --> 01:34:15,130
Must I take Mrs. Sewing
out to drinks again?

1379
01:34:15,265 --> 01:34:17,131
No, no, no, nothing to do
with the orchestra.

1380
01:34:17,266 --> 01:34:19,303
Do you remember
an Accordion Academy fellow

1381
01:34:19,439 --> 01:34:21,938
named Krista Taylor?

1382
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:27,150
Yes. Why?

1383
01:34:27,286 --> 01:34:29,786
Apparently,
she committed suicide.

1384
01:34:29,922 --> 01:34:32,954
Oh, God. Poor thing.

1385
01:34:33,089 --> 01:34:35,019
Her parents mu...

1386
01:34:35,955 --> 01:34:38,557
Wait, sorry,
I'm... I'm confused, Britta.

1387
01:34:38,693 --> 01:34:40,964
Why, why were you put
in the position

1388
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:42,300
to deliver this terrible news?

1389
01:34:42,434 --> 01:34:44,362
Why didn't Accordion
contact me directly?

1390
01:34:44,497 --> 01:34:46,367
It's delicate, Lydia.

1391
01:34:46,502 --> 01:34:47,970
Mr. Kaplan thought
it might be best

1392
01:34:48,106 --> 01:34:49,372
if you contacted a lawyer

1393
01:34:49,507 --> 01:34:51,969
before speaking with anyone
at Accordion.

1394
01:34:52,105 --> 01:34:55,477
Well, presumably, that anyone
includes Eliot himself.

1395
01:34:57,483 --> 01:35:00,713
I'm, I'm sorry, why-why
would I need to do that?

1396
01:35:00,848 --> 01:35:05,289
Apparently, some accusations
have been made.

1397
01:35:06,854 --> 01:35:08,824
Accusations?
What kind of accusations?

1398
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,426
He didn't say.

1399
01:35:10,561 --> 01:35:12,825
But they were brought
to Accordion's counsel.

1400
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:15,889
Mr. Kaplan said he's certain
nothing will come of it,

1401
01:35:16,025 --> 01:35:18,632
but one can't be too careful.

1402
01:35:37,149 --> 01:35:39,587
I'm sorry about the hour.
It's Lydia Tár calling.

1403
01:35:39,722 --> 01:35:42,856
I need to speak to Mr. Singer
immediately.

1404
01:35:42,992 --> 01:35:44,256
Yes.

1405
01:35:44,391 --> 01:35:46,363
Yes, it's urgent.

1406
01:36:15,354 --> 01:36:17,394
Tired?

1407
01:36:20,426 --> 01:36:22,895
Sleep's elusive.

1408
01:36:23,798 --> 01:36:26,370
I was the same
before a recording date.

1409
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:29,736
Lydia...

1410
01:36:29,871 --> 01:36:33,470
are-are you absolutely
certain about Sebastian?

1411
01:36:36,072 --> 01:36:38,773
Who will you replace him with?

1412
01:36:38,908 --> 01:36:41,145
Possibly Andrew Crust.

1413
01:36:42,048 --> 01:36:45,316
He's been assisting
Otto Tausk at the VSO.

1414
01:36:45,452 --> 01:36:47,919
Not the girl?

1415
01:36:56,726 --> 01:36:58,831
Andris...

1416
01:37:02,065 --> 01:37:04,768
have you ever had an issue

1417
01:37:04,903 --> 01:37:07,468
with a, a student or colleague,

1418
01:37:07,604 --> 01:37:09,721
where that person may have
misinterpreted your intention?

1419
01:37:09,746 --> 01:37:11,226
Has someone been complaining
about me?

1420
01:37:11,276 --> 01:37:13,356
- No, no, no, of course not.
- Because at this point,

1421
01:37:13,381 --> 01:37:14,813
they've missed their chance.

1422
01:37:14,917 --> 01:37:16,985
- I'm out of the game.
- Yes, yes, I know, I know.

1423
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:18,378
Course you are.

1424
01:37:18,513 --> 01:37:20,319
Thank God I was never pulled
from the podium

1425
01:37:20,454 --> 01:37:22,391
like Jimmy Levine.

1426
01:37:22,527 --> 01:37:26,285
Or-or hunted
like Charles Dutoit.

1427
01:37:26,421 --> 01:37:28,829
I take it you're asking
for a reason.

1428
01:37:28,965 --> 01:37:31,825
Well, there's just been
so much of this sort of thing

1429
01:37:31,961 --> 01:37:33,495
in the news lately.

1430
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:36,936
Well, nowadays, to be accused
is the same as being guilty.

1431
01:37:37,872 --> 01:37:39,399
But I suppose
that was also the case

1432
01:37:39,534 --> 01:37:42,506
all those years ago
with Furtwängler.

1433
01:37:42,642 --> 01:37:45,779
A bit with Karajan, too.

1434
01:37:48,386 --> 01:37:51,050
Who was the better conductor?

1435
01:37:51,886 --> 01:37:54,349
I never played
under Furtwängler.

1436
01:37:54,484 --> 01:37:56,720
Yeah, when I first arrived here,
the older members

1437
01:37:56,856 --> 01:38:00,026
had hmm, hushed opinions.

1438
01:38:00,162 --> 01:38:03,493
At the same time, they wanted
to leave that era behind.

1439
01:38:03,629 --> 01:38:05,024
What, the war?

1440
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:06,331
No, postwar.

1441
01:38:06,466 --> 01:38:08,600
Denazification.

1442
01:38:08,735 --> 01:38:10,339
Someone pointed a finger at you,

1443
01:38:10,474 --> 01:38:12,408
process started all over again.

1444
01:38:12,544 --> 01:38:15,111
Furtwängler never joined
the Party.

1445
01:38:15,247 --> 01:38:16,512
Refused to give the salute

1446
01:38:16,648 --> 01:38:18,678
or to conduct the
"Horst-Wessel-Lied."

1447
01:38:18,814 --> 01:38:21,514
Or to sign his letters,
"Heil, Hitler."

1448
01:38:21,650 --> 01:38:24,552
Even those he wrote to Hitler.

1449
01:38:24,688 --> 01:38:29,226
But he was obliged
to be denazified.

1450
01:38:29,361 --> 01:38:32,027
Until then, he was semiretired,

1451
01:38:32,162 --> 01:38:34,696
playing corpses.

1452
01:38:35,495 --> 01:38:37,532
Playing corpses?

1453
01:38:37,668 --> 01:38:40,999
Secretly performing
in a graveyard.

1454
01:38:42,531 --> 01:38:44,702
You're not equating
sexual impropriety

1455
01:38:44,837 --> 01:38:47,104
with being an accused Nazi?

1456
01:38:48,170 --> 01:38:49,712
Either way, you had to be ready.

1457
01:38:49,848 --> 01:38:52,480
For years, I made sure
all the hangers in my closet

1458
01:38:52,615 --> 01:38:54,848
were facing the same direction.

1459
01:39:05,387 --> 01:39:08,257
How many are auditioning
on Monday?

1460
01:39:12,531 --> 01:39:14,065
No one.

1461
01:39:15,039 --> 01:39:16,705
No one?

1462
01:39:18,209 --> 01:39:20,575
Maybe Martin.

1463
01:39:20,711 --> 01:39:22,436
He's never gotten along
with Gosia.

1464
01:39:22,571 --> 01:39:25,208
He would love to sit downstage
for once.

1465
01:39:26,875 --> 01:39:29,276
Well...

1466
01:39:29,412 --> 01:39:31,720
he's still gonna
have to audition.

1467
01:39:33,454 --> 01:39:35,356
Of course.

1468
01:39:35,492 --> 01:39:37,726
Have to follow the rules.

1469
01:39:39,556 --> 01:39:41,929
Aren't we being
a bit formal, Francesca?

1470
01:39:42,064 --> 01:39:44,600
From what I understand,
there's only one player, right?

1471
01:39:44,736 --> 01:39:47,637
No, Maestro, there are two.

1472
01:40:49,831 --> 01:40:51,699
Well, it's unanimous.

1473
01:40:51,834 --> 01:40:54,402
Number two.

1474
01:40:54,537 --> 01:40:55,835
And we have a problem.

1475
01:40:55,971 --> 01:40:57,331
She's not officially
been invited

1476
01:40:57,467 --> 01:40:59,643
to become a member
of the orchestra.

1477
01:41:00,812 --> 01:41:04,109
Well, she wouldn't need to be
to solo for us.

1478
01:41:04,244 --> 01:41:06,347
I believe the criteria
of the audition

1479
01:41:06,483 --> 01:41:08,875
was all section members?

1480
01:41:09,010 --> 01:41:11,215
- Then her audition gets thrown out.
- No.

1481
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:13,719
Francesca, please ask Martin
to come back in

1482
01:41:13,854 --> 01:41:16,049
so we can give him the news.

1483
01:41:16,185 --> 01:41:18,189
Wait. Gosia, let's talk.

1484
01:41:20,561 --> 01:41:23,023
Shit!

1485
01:41:24,363 --> 01:41:26,769
Yeah!

1486
01:41:28,103 --> 01:41:31,470
I'll confirm solo rehearsal
dates with her.

1487
01:41:31,605 --> 01:41:33,439
Thank you.

1488
01:41:33,574 --> 01:41:35,778
Have a seat.

1489
01:41:40,013 --> 01:41:41,947
I have made a decision

1490
01:41:42,083 --> 01:41:44,886
regarding Sebastian's
replacement.

1491
01:41:46,023 --> 01:41:49,759
And I want you to know
it wasn't an easy one.

1492
01:41:51,094 --> 01:41:55,426
This position brings with it
enormous responsibility,

1493
01:41:55,561 --> 01:41:58,891
and my personal affection
for you aside...

1494
01:41:59,027 --> 01:42:03,905
I will have to go with
someone more, more experienced.

1495
01:43:03,699 --> 01:43:05,631
Leave me alone.

1496
01:43:05,767 --> 01:43:08,134
I don't have your paper.

1497
01:43:09,002 --> 01:43:10,836
I've told you before, I...

1498
01:43:10,972 --> 01:43:13,172
I'm sorry. Please come in.

1499
01:43:59,181 --> 01:44:00,385
Good. Good.

1500
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:03,450
I think the contrast is,
it's much better now.

1501
01:44:03,585 --> 01:44:04,958
Don't you think?

1502
01:44:05,094 --> 01:44:06,856
How do you take your coffee?

1503
01:44:06,992 --> 01:44:09,228
Black. Strong.

1504
01:44:10,865 --> 01:44:12,692
Is all right if I play?

1505
01:44:12,827 --> 01:44:15,333
Yes, of course, of course.

1506
01:45:03,821 --> 01:45:06,278
That's as far as I've gotten.

1507
01:45:06,414 --> 01:45:08,424
But it's good.

1508
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:11,125
This part here.

1509
01:45:14,897 --> 01:45:17,263
Maybe change A to B-flat?

1510
01:45:20,972 --> 01:45:23,434
That's better.
I like that sound.

1511
01:45:25,071 --> 01:45:27,310
Come on. Take a break.

1512
01:45:27,445 --> 01:45:29,407
Okay.

1513
01:45:41,792 --> 01:45:43,289
<i>Sharon?</i>

1514
01:45:46,595 --> 01:45:48,459
Hello.

1515
01:46:04,272 --> 01:46:06,114
Petra.

1516
01:46:31,875 --> 01:46:33,700
What are you doing in here?

1517
01:46:33,836 --> 01:46:36,744
I'm hiding from her.

1518
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:38,246
Why?

1519
01:46:38,381 --> 01:46:41,408
Because she told me
to put my things in order,

1520
01:46:41,543 --> 01:46:44,383
but they already are.

1521
01:46:47,151 --> 01:46:49,355
I can see that.

1522
01:46:50,351 --> 01:46:51,518
Come on.

1523
01:46:51,653 --> 01:46:53,523
They're all waiting for you.

1524
01:46:53,659 --> 01:46:56,897
I'm going to give
everyone a pencil.

1525
01:46:57,032 --> 01:46:58,195
All of them?

1526
01:46:58,331 --> 01:46:59,860
They can't all conduct, honey.

1527
01:46:59,995 --> 01:47:03,534
It's not a,
it's not a democracy.

1528
01:48:09,167 --> 01:48:10,771
Okay...

1529
01:48:17,004 --> 01:48:19,640
- Hey, that's good.
- Yeah. Good.

1530
01:48:19,775 --> 01:48:20,881
You happy?

1531
01:48:24,453 --> 01:48:27,289
How long were you acquainted
with Miss Taylor?

1532
01:48:27,424 --> 01:48:31,389
I'd have to double-check
with my assistant,

1533
01:48:31,524 --> 01:48:34,326
but cumulatively speaking,
I'd say

1534
01:48:34,462 --> 01:48:37,024
not more than a few months.

1535
01:48:37,159 --> 01:48:39,765
- Thank you for your time, Maestro.
- Not at all.

1536
01:48:40,935 --> 01:48:43,272
This recording will exist on
a protected server...

1537
01:48:43,297 --> 01:48:45,469
Under attorney-client
privilege with Mr. Singer.

1538
01:48:45,605 --> 01:48:47,207
- Great.
- He will follow up with you

1539
01:48:47,343 --> 01:48:49,211
to help prepare
for the deposition.

1540
01:48:52,507 --> 01:48:54,306
Deposition?

1541
01:48:54,442 --> 01:48:55,817
Yes.

1542
01:48:55,953 --> 01:48:57,648
I assumed you were aware.

1543
01:48:57,783 --> 01:48:59,820
Mr. Singer's office said
they'd been coordinating

1544
01:48:59,956 --> 01:49:01,853
with your assistant.

1545
01:49:01,988 --> 01:49:04,384
Francesca, you'd better get
your pretty little ass to work

1546
01:49:04,519 --> 01:49:06,060
right now.

1547
01:49:07,728 --> 01:49:09,768
The only communication
we've received from Francesca

1548
01:49:09,793 --> 01:49:11,953
was an email to my assistant
in the middle of the night

1549
01:49:12,027 --> 01:49:13,427
tendering her immediate
resignation,

1550
01:49:13,499 --> 01:49:15,170
stating she would be in contact

1551
01:49:15,306 --> 01:49:17,663
when she had more details
to provide.

1552
01:49:17,798 --> 01:49:19,170
What kind of details?

1553
01:49:19,306 --> 01:49:20,738
A new address, I suppose.

1554
01:49:20,873 --> 01:49:23,111
In the meantime,
we've been trying all morning

1555
01:49:23,247 --> 01:49:24,846
to find someone suitable
to assist you

1556
01:49:24,981 --> 01:49:26,182
on a temporary basis.

1557
01:49:26,317 --> 01:49:28,077
For now, perhaps
your new assistant conductor

1558
01:49:28,149 --> 01:49:29,583
would be the right fit.

1559
01:49:29,719 --> 01:49:32,084
No. No. He's not available
'til after the live Five date.

1560
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:34,322
Yes, I'm ready. Let's go.

1561
01:49:38,328 --> 01:49:40,094
I know how much
you depended on her.

1562
01:49:40,230 --> 01:49:41,588
Two-faced little bitch.

1563
01:49:41,723 --> 01:49:43,189
Imagine her hurt, Tár.

1564
01:49:43,325 --> 01:49:45,692
- Don't you dare try to defend her.
- God, slow down!

1565
01:49:45,827 --> 01:49:47,360
She'll come galumphing back.

1566
01:49:47,495 --> 01:49:49,895
- I mean, I've got a dumb phone like every robot.
- Tár, s...

1567
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:51,571
How hard can it be to text
all day?

1568
01:49:51,707 --> 01:49:54,104
Slow down!

1569
01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:56,575
Or let me out!

1570
01:50:17,465 --> 01:50:19,697
Francesca!

1571
01:50:52,733 --> 01:50:55,436
Fräulein?

1572
01:51:44,953 --> 01:51:46,184
Come.

1573
01:53:22,452 --> 01:53:24,084
Sorry I'm late again.

1574
01:53:31,062 --> 01:53:33,753
D-Do you live here?

1575
01:53:33,888 --> 01:53:36,097
Not normally, no.

1576
01:53:36,233 --> 01:53:37,594
Make yourself at home.

1577
01:53:37,729 --> 01:53:39,033
I'm just gonna put something on.

1578
01:53:39,169 --> 01:53:40,634
Do you have a towel?

1579
01:53:42,735 --> 01:53:45,100
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1580
01:53:50,247 --> 01:53:52,976
I got caught in the rain.

1581
01:54:04,123 --> 01:54:06,686
There is small concert
with musician friends.

1582
01:54:06,821 --> 01:54:08,158
You should come.

1583
01:54:09,262 --> 01:54:12,796
Thanks, but I...
really must get home.

1584
01:54:12,931 --> 01:54:15,971
You have child, yes?

1585
01:54:16,107 --> 01:54:17,803
I will not do that.

1586
01:54:20,134 --> 01:54:21,939
Pets are better for some people.

1587
01:54:34,816 --> 01:54:35,914
What...

1588
01:54:36,049 --> 01:54:37,249
- Sorry.
- Bye.

1589
01:54:37,384 --> 01:54:38,488
Oh, yes. Goodbye. Yes.

1590
01:54:38,624 --> 01:54:39,986
- Goodbye.
- Okay.

1591
01:54:40,122 --> 01:54:41,959
Okay.

1592
01:54:48,896 --> 01:54:50,663
Oh, Olga!

1593
01:54:50,798 --> 01:54:51,903
Olga!

1594
01:54:59,917 --> 01:55:01,715
Olga?

1595
01:55:08,321 --> 01:55:10,493
Olga?

1596
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:40,523
Hello?

1597
01:55:52,233 --> 01:55:53,932
Olga?

1598
01:56:12,550 --> 01:56:14,216
Olga?

1599
01:56:23,396 --> 01:56:24,760
Olga?

1600
01:57:12,306 --> 01:57:14,307
Why didn't you go to the police?

1601
01:57:14,442 --> 01:57:17,279
I fought. He ran.
What's to tell?

1602
01:57:20,948 --> 01:57:22,053
Oh, God.

1603
01:57:22,188 --> 01:57:23,369
I'm gonna get you something
for the pain.

1604
01:57:23,394 --> 01:57:24,434
No, I don't need anything.

1605
01:57:24,461 --> 01:57:26,488
No, I'm gonna get you something.

1606
01:57:32,664 --> 01:57:34,296
<i>Ja.</i>

1607
01:57:49,817 --> 01:57:52,314
Lydia!

1608
01:57:54,982 --> 01:57:55,982
Lydia!

1609
01:58:01,693 --> 01:58:03,666
What is it?

1610
01:58:05,731 --> 01:58:07,835
Hold my foot.

1611
01:58:16,169 --> 01:58:17,539
Is that better?

1612
01:58:17,675 --> 01:58:19,242
Yes.

1613
01:59:00,553 --> 01:59:02,252
Okay.

1614
01:59:02,387 --> 01:59:05,057
Let's shoo the elephant
from the room.

1615
01:59:06,159 --> 01:59:08,830
"What the hell happened
to her face?"

1616
01:59:08,965 --> 01:59:11,263
"Did she schedule
a nose and eye job

1617
01:59:11,399 --> 01:59:14,027
and bail before the surgeon
finished the other half?"

1618
01:59:19,242 --> 01:59:20,969
No.

1619
01:59:21,105 --> 01:59:22,639
I was I was attacked.

1620
01:59:22,774 --> 01:59:25,170
Thank you.

1621
01:59:25,305 --> 01:59:27,146
I'm fine. Really.

1622
01:59:27,281 --> 01:59:29,118
Should've seen the other guy.

1623
01:59:29,253 --> 01:59:30,253
All right.

1624
02:00:15,465 --> 02:00:16,990
Don't.

1625
02:00:17,125 --> 02:00:18,663
It burns.

1626
02:00:18,799 --> 02:00:20,832
You must see the doctor.

1627
02:00:20,967 --> 02:00:22,735
He's booked 'til next week.

1628
02:00:22,871 --> 02:00:24,069
I'll call them again

1629
02:00:24,205 --> 02:00:25,732
and tell them how much pain
you're in.

1630
02:00:25,867 --> 02:00:28,242
No, no, let's just,
let's just finish up here.

1631
02:00:28,377 --> 02:00:29,843
Okay?

1632
02:00:29,979 --> 02:00:31,876
Overall, the balance
feels right.

1633
02:00:32,011 --> 02:00:33,243
Other than a quick brushup,

1634
02:00:33,378 --> 02:00:35,779
we should concentrate
on the Elgar.

1635
02:00:35,915 --> 02:00:38,583
You're certain of that?

1636
02:00:38,718 --> 02:00:41,022
I think so. Yes.

1637
02:00:41,158 --> 02:00:42,891
<i>We're absolutely
rock-solid there,</i>

1638
02:00:43,026 --> 02:00:47,720
but I am going to try
to hold them back here.

1639
02:00:47,855 --> 02:00:49,635
They're just
getting caught up in the power

1640
02:00:49,660 --> 02:00:53,466
of your glissando
in there, trying to match it.

1641
02:00:53,601 --> 02:00:56,572
Probably...

1642
02:00:56,707 --> 02:00:59,198
Where were you attacked,
Maestro?

1643
02:00:59,334 --> 02:01:02,244
Doesn't matter.

1644
02:01:02,379 --> 02:01:03,874
Here.

1645
02:01:04,009 --> 02:01:07,205
Thank you.

1646
02:01:07,341 --> 02:01:08,778
There you are.

1647
02:01:09,681 --> 02:01:11,948
- When did this fall happen?
- It's all a blur.

1648
02:01:12,083 --> 02:01:14,754
Three, four days ago.

1649
02:01:14,889 --> 02:01:16,288
It's just my shoulder. Yeah.

1650
02:01:16,423 --> 02:01:20,093
It kind of burns,
like I fell asleep by the pool.

1651
02:01:21,228 --> 02:01:24,390
Okay, you can
put your shirt back on.

1652
02:01:24,525 --> 02:01:25,734
You've damaged some nerves.

1653
02:01:25,870 --> 02:01:27,270
The burning sensation
you're feeling

1654
02:01:27,295 --> 02:01:28,732
is called notalgia paresthetica.

1655
02:01:28,867 --> 02:01:29,965
Nostalgia?

1656
02:01:30,101 --> 02:01:32,302
"Notalgia." No "S."

1657
02:01:32,438 --> 02:01:34,839
- Well, how do we treat it?
- You don't.

1658
02:01:34,975 --> 02:01:36,308
Eventually, it goes away.

1659
02:01:36,444 --> 02:01:39,882
An adjustment might help.
You're somewhat crooked.

1660
02:02:28,264 --> 02:02:30,128
Well, then you must be

1661
02:02:30,264 --> 02:02:33,661
a Negro product
exploited by the Jews.

1662
02:02:35,130 --> 02:02:37,968
Now let's turn our gaze back
to the piano bench up there

1663
02:02:38,104 --> 02:02:40,338
to a superhot young woman.

1664
02:02:41,440 --> 02:02:43,468
That's-that's...
th-that was very good.

1665
02:02:43,604 --> 02:02:45,639
Now, you could masturbate,

1666
02:02:45,775 --> 02:02:49,380
but what are you
actually doing to me?

1667
02:02:54,989 --> 02:02:56,355
- Britta.
- Hi, hi.

1668
02:02:56,490 --> 02:02:59,221
- Have you seen it?
- Yes, yes. I've just seen it.

1669
02:02:59,357 --> 02:03:02,326
Gathering this afternoon.

1670
02:03:02,461 --> 02:03:04,360
- This afternoon?
- Is that a problem?

1671
02:03:04,496 --> 02:03:06,694
No, just... No, it's no problem.

1672
02:03:40,327 --> 02:03:45,864
First of all, that class was
conducted in a tech-free zone.

1673
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:49,607
And second,
whoever violated that rule

1674
02:03:49,742 --> 02:03:52,978
edited what we've all seen
to create linguistic traps

1675
02:03:53,113 --> 02:03:54,578
to completely redefine my words.

1676
02:03:54,714 --> 02:03:56,876
I mean, look at the
reverse shots on the students.

1677
02:03:57,011 --> 02:03:58,718
There's no way that was done
in real time.

1678
02:03:58,854 --> 02:04:00,150
It's a hatchet job.

1679
02:04:00,285 --> 02:04:02,247
I'm sure that's true, Lydia.

1680
02:04:02,382 --> 02:04:06,061
And were it just this video,
we would not be sitting here.

1681
02:04:06,156 --> 02:04:07,836
Unfortunately,
it's linked to an article in

1682
02:04:07,861 --> 02:04:10,262
the<i> New York Post</i> regarding
Krista Taylor's suicide,

1683
02:04:10,397 --> 02:04:13,164
which alludes to
other Accordion fellows

1684
02:04:13,299 --> 02:04:15,169
they claim to have interviewed.

1685
02:04:15,305 --> 02:04:17,396
Laura, can you tell us
about your conversations?

1686
02:04:17,532 --> 02:04:18,740
We haven't had any.

1687
02:04:18,876 --> 02:04:20,408
Obviously, we gave no response

1688
02:04:20,543 --> 02:04:23,077
as we first wanted to meet
to discuss strategy.

1689
02:04:23,213 --> 02:04:25,542
- Here's the article.
- Thank you, Laura.

1690
02:04:29,945 --> 02:04:33,187
"Enticed and groomed
multiple young women

1691
02:04:33,322 --> 02:04:36,180
"to engage in sex acts
for professional favors.

1692
02:04:36,316 --> 02:04:38,825
Blocked opportunities
to those who didn't comply."

1693
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:41,260
This is total fiction.

1694
02:04:41,396 --> 02:04:43,688
And the<i> Post</i> is
a how-de-do scandal rag.

1695
02:04:43,823 --> 02:04:46,563
No serious person reads it.

1696
02:04:49,403 --> 02:04:53,102
And so far as
Krista Taylor goes,

1697
02:04:53,237 --> 02:04:54,599
she was disturbed.

1698
02:04:54,735 --> 02:04:56,709
I mean, she fixated on me.

1699
02:04:56,844 --> 02:04:58,613
In what way?

1700
02:04:58,749 --> 02:05:00,044
She sent me weird gifts.

1701
02:05:00,179 --> 02:05:01,713
She trolled me online.

1702
02:05:01,848 --> 02:05:04,649
- She tried to send me signals.
- Well, what kind of signals?

1703
02:05:04,785 --> 02:05:07,945
She vandalized my Wikipedia
page to say she was my muse.

1704
02:05:08,081 --> 02:05:10,324
I mean,
that's easily checked, right?

1705
02:05:10,459 --> 02:05:14,096
And did you ever report this
or file a complaint?

1706
02:05:15,664 --> 02:05:17,122
No.

1707
02:05:17,258 --> 02:05:19,833
No. And I... Look, I probably,
I probably should have.

1708
02:05:19,969 --> 02:05:22,334
I... I felt sorry for her.

1709
02:05:22,470 --> 02:05:24,070
Is this something
you shared with Sharon?

1710
02:05:24,197 --> 02:05:25,965
No. I didn't want
to burden her with it.

1711
02:05:26,101 --> 02:05:27,974
- Don't you think you should have?
- Yes. Yes.

1712
02:05:28,110 --> 02:05:29,673
Well, what-what do you advise?

1713
02:05:29,808 --> 02:05:32,304
Well, for now, it hasn't gotten
all that much traction.

1714
02:05:32,439 --> 02:05:35,007
None of the trades have linked
to it or called for comment.

1715
02:05:35,142 --> 02:05:37,451
So I say let's see what happens.

1716
02:05:38,687 --> 02:05:42,155
We wanted to give you as much
warning as possible, Lydia,

1717
02:05:42,291 --> 02:05:44,224
before this Friday's
donor meeting.

1718
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:46,159
Well, unfortunately,
I won't be there.

1719
02:05:46,295 --> 02:05:48,491
Well, I very much advise
that you are.

1720
02:05:48,627 --> 02:05:50,326
I have the book launch
in New York

1721
02:05:50,461 --> 02:05:53,168
and apparently a deposition.

1722
02:05:54,403 --> 02:05:57,403
Well, we'll fill you in
upon your return, then.

1723
02:05:59,975 --> 02:06:01,737
Enjoy your weekend.

1724
02:06:03,977 --> 02:06:06,043
Starving.

1725
02:06:06,179 --> 02:06:07,778
Finished my thing today.

1726
02:06:07,913 --> 02:06:10,785
Congratulations.
We should go out and celebrate.

1727
02:06:10,920 --> 02:06:12,744
I can't. I gotta pack.

1728
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:14,651
- Hi!
- Hi, Lydia.

1729
02:06:20,061 --> 02:06:21,894
Sharon?

1730
02:06:22,029 --> 02:06:24,132
Yeah?

1731
02:06:24,268 --> 02:06:26,026
You seen my performance score?

1732
02:06:26,161 --> 02:06:28,398
No. Why?
Isn't it with the other ones?

1733
02:06:28,533 --> 02:06:30,434
No. No, it's not.

1734
02:06:30,570 --> 02:06:33,274
Are you sure
it's not in my office?

1735
02:06:35,608 --> 02:06:38,378
Yeah, what about
the orchestra library?

1736
02:06:40,008 --> 02:06:42,547
Yeah, can you
check again, please?

1737
02:06:45,285 --> 02:06:47,849
I don't know. Yes, exactly.

1738
02:07:04,865 --> 02:07:07,004
Lydia?

1739
02:07:09,569 --> 02:07:10,977
Yes?

1740
02:07:11,112 --> 02:07:13,847
When will you be back?

1741
02:07:13,983 --> 02:07:16,146
The day after tomorrow.

1742
02:07:16,281 --> 02:07:17,982
Will you promise?

1743
02:07:18,117 --> 02:07:20,486
Yes, I promise.

1744
02:07:30,892 --> 02:07:33,301
- Good night.
- Good night.

1745
02:07:47,447 --> 02:07:49,717
Thanks. Do you have any bottles?

1746
02:07:49,852 --> 02:07:51,147
Of course.

1747
02:07:52,150 --> 02:07:54,350
Do you need anything else
before I close the cabin door?

1748
02:07:54,423 --> 02:07:57,490
Yes. We're waiting on one more.

1749
02:08:04,091 --> 02:08:05,397
<i>To all my questions</i>

1750
02:08:05,533 --> 02:08:07,199
pertaining to
your communications

1751
02:08:07,335 --> 02:08:09,971
with Krista Taylor and others,

1752
02:08:10,107 --> 02:08:12,504
your answers have always been

1753
02:08:12,639 --> 02:08:17,444
"I don't know"
or "I don't remember."

1754
02:08:19,613 --> 02:08:21,139
Is there anything
I could show you

1755
02:08:21,275 --> 02:08:24,152
that might help refresh
your recollection?

1756
02:08:24,287 --> 02:08:26,750
Any documents,
such as emails from you

1757
02:08:26,885 --> 02:08:29,348
or your personal assistant,
Miss Lentini,

1758
02:08:29,484 --> 02:08:33,493
that might help you recall
what you did and didn't say?

1759
02:08:41,533 --> 02:08:43,270
I guess you heard by now.

1760
02:08:43,406 --> 02:08:46,341
Bryant Park bumped you
to 53rd Street.

1761
02:08:49,469 --> 02:08:52,512
This is the Kaplan Fund's
prepared statement.

1762
02:08:54,547 --> 02:08:56,075
I'm sorry to say this is likely

1763
02:08:56,210 --> 02:08:57,583
the last time
we'll see each other.

1764
02:08:57,718 --> 02:09:00,011
Well, now I can buy
my own plane tickets.

1765
02:09:00,146 --> 02:09:01,521
And you can bother someone else

1766
02:09:01,656 --> 02:09:05,090
to try and teach you
to crawl to the podium.

1767
02:09:22,574 --> 02:09:24,942
Is there a back entrance?

1768
02:09:25,077 --> 02:09:29,283
"Indeed, the common metaphors
used to explain music"

1769
02:09:29,419 --> 02:09:31,483
"are based on
the idea that music"

1770
02:09:31,619 --> 02:09:36,214
"is a language,
albeit a secret one."

1771
02:09:36,350 --> 02:09:41,429
"And in this way,
holy and unknowable."

1772
02:09:43,061 --> 02:09:46,633
"These joyful noises we make
being the closest thing"

1773
02:09:46,769 --> 02:09:50,735
"any of us might ever
experience to the divine..."

1774
02:09:52,039 --> 02:09:57,038
"Yet something born by
the mere act of moving air."

1775
02:09:59,215 --> 02:10:01,812
"No different than birdsong."

1776
02:10:10,583 --> 02:10:12,923
So, meet downstairs
in half an hour for dinner?

1777
02:10:13,058 --> 02:10:15,760
Thank you, but I am jet-lagged.
I go to sleep now.

1778
02:10:15,895 --> 02:10:19,962
Yeah, me, too.
I'll... probably do the same.

1779
02:11:18,657 --> 02:11:20,251
Yes, hello.

1780
02:11:20,387 --> 02:11:23,164
Yes, there's no water
in my room.

1781
02:11:23,300 --> 02:11:25,324
Yes, I've checked the minibar.

1782
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:27,764
How long would it take
to get a bottle of water?

1783
02:11:27,900 --> 02:11:30,670
Don't worry.
I'll just come down.

1784
02:11:33,573 --> 02:11:35,169
Lobby, please.

1785
02:12:02,028 --> 02:12:04,862
Oh, Jesus.

1786
02:12:17,176 --> 02:12:19,686
It was Britta.

1787
02:12:20,517 --> 02:12:22,280
Right?

1788
02:12:22,416 --> 02:12:24,250
I mean, that is
how you heard about

1789
02:12:24,385 --> 02:12:26,925
these millennial robots
trading in lies.

1790
02:12:27,060 --> 02:12:29,728
I couldn't care less about
the Juilliard thing.

1791
02:12:29,863 --> 02:12:31,889
Too much time on her hands.

1792
02:12:32,025 --> 02:12:33,264
She's fringe.

1793
02:12:33,399 --> 02:12:35,602
The worst kind.

1794
02:12:35,737 --> 02:12:37,805
Every time
I walk out of this house,

1795
02:12:37,940 --> 02:12:41,566
she's in your ear with intrigue
or she's asking me about

1796
02:12:41,702 --> 02:12:44,843
some other piece of fringe,
like Samantha Hankey.

1797
02:12:44,978 --> 02:12:47,945
God, a nobody
who has nothing better to do

1798
02:12:48,081 --> 02:12:52,417
than drop my name at lunch
and imply things.

1799
02:12:52,552 --> 02:12:54,154
I feel sorry for you.

1800
02:12:54,289 --> 02:12:56,283
Save it.

1801
02:12:57,284 --> 02:12:59,660
I tried calling you last night.

1802
02:13:01,595 --> 02:13:04,264
Did you have fun with her?

1803
02:13:04,399 --> 02:13:07,199
My back is killing me.

1804
02:13:07,334 --> 02:13:08,593
Francesca left,

1805
02:13:08,728 --> 02:13:11,164
and I simply needed someone
to carry my bags.

1806
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:13,207
I mean, who was I
supposed to ask?

1807
02:13:13,343 --> 02:13:16,276
To go with me? Knut?

1808
02:13:16,412 --> 02:13:17,844
Jesus fucking...

1809
02:13:17,980 --> 02:13:20,172
There are many things
I accept about you.

1810
02:13:20,307 --> 02:13:21,683
And in the end,

1811
02:13:21,818 --> 02:13:25,610
I'm sure I could get over
something like this.

1812
02:13:25,745 --> 02:13:28,623
But that's not what
we're talking about, is it?

1813
02:13:31,084 --> 02:13:32,385
These accusations

1814
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:35,663
from the parents of the girl
who suicided?

1815
02:13:40,693 --> 02:13:43,297
You honestly believe
what they're saying?

1816
02:13:47,474 --> 02:13:49,138
They're lies.

1817
02:13:50,878 --> 02:13:52,579
Do you understand
what it was like

1818
02:13:52,715 --> 02:13:54,715
to walk into
my sectional yesterday

1819
02:13:54,850 --> 02:13:57,710
and to see everybody
whispering about me?

1820
02:13:57,845 --> 02:14:02,387
It's got nothing to do with
what they're accusing you of.

1821
02:14:02,523 --> 02:14:04,484
It's a simple matter

1822
02:14:04,619 --> 02:14:07,993
of not warning me
that our family is in danger.

1823
02:14:08,830 --> 02:14:10,997
And what good
would that have done?

1824
02:14:11,133 --> 02:14:14,066
I mean, what could you possibly
do to make things better?

1825
02:14:16,537 --> 02:14:18,733
Because I deserve that.

1826
02:14:18,869 --> 02:14:21,005
Those are the rules.

1827
02:14:21,974 --> 02:14:24,409
You are to ask
for my fucking counsel,

1828
02:14:24,545 --> 02:14:26,505
the way you always have.

1829
02:14:26,640 --> 02:14:28,344
The way you did
when you first arrived here

1830
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:31,343
as a guest conductor looking
for a permanent position.

1831
02:14:31,479 --> 02:14:33,754
You asked me
what were the politics,

1832
02:14:33,889 --> 02:14:36,847
what were the moves,
how could we swing it.

1833
02:14:39,525 --> 02:14:41,191
Of course...

1834
02:14:41,326 --> 02:14:44,726
these conversations
took place in another bed.

1835
02:14:44,862 --> 02:14:47,560
Or rather, the couch

1836
02:14:47,695 --> 02:14:50,028
of that horrible place
you still can't let go of.

1837
02:14:50,164 --> 02:14:52,839
Old sorrow blows in.

1838
02:14:54,375 --> 02:14:58,845
How cruel of you to define our
relationship as transactional.

1839
02:15:02,008 --> 02:15:06,050
There's only one relationship
you've ever had that wasn't.

1840
02:15:06,185 --> 02:15:09,120
And she is sleeping
in the room next door.

1841
02:15:09,255 --> 02:15:12,353
Apparently, this hasn't even
crossed your mind.

1842
02:17:24,923 --> 02:17:27,026
Petra!

1843
02:17:29,598 --> 02:17:31,261
Come here, darling.

1844
02:17:33,670 --> 02:17:34,867
- It was good.
- Was it?

1845
02:17:35,003 --> 02:17:37,334
- Yeah.
- You want to go to the park?

1846
02:17:38,204 --> 02:17:40,307
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.

1847
02:17:40,443 --> 02:17:42,041
Please don't.

1848
02:18:08,066 --> 02:18:10,562
Hello. I am Anna Franzen.

1849
02:18:10,698 --> 02:18:13,534
This is
my late mother's apartment.

1850
02:18:14,967 --> 02:18:18,345
Oh, yeah, I'm so sorry
about your mother.

1851
02:18:18,480 --> 02:18:20,579
Thank you.

1852
02:18:20,715 --> 02:18:22,742
How's your sister doing?

1853
02:18:22,877 --> 02:18:25,948
Eleanor lives now
in a facility in Neukölln.

1854
02:18:26,084 --> 02:18:27,779
I'm sorry to trouble you,

1855
02:18:27,914 --> 02:18:31,088
but my husband and I
are selling the place

1856
02:18:31,224 --> 02:18:35,327
and couldn't help
hearing the music.

1857
02:18:36,723 --> 02:18:38,095
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

1858
02:18:38,231 --> 02:18:39,798
We were wondering if there are

1859
02:18:39,933 --> 02:18:41,760
specific hours you rehearse,

1860
02:18:41,895 --> 02:18:44,566
so we can schedule showings
around them.

1861
02:18:45,602 --> 02:18:48,442
We don't want to scare
potential buyers off

1862
02:18:48,578 --> 02:18:50,940
with all the noise.

1863
02:18:51,075 --> 02:18:53,543
Oh, no.

1864
02:18:53,679 --> 02:18:54,679
No.

1865
02:18:56,917 --> 02:18:58,814
No, we wouldn't want that.

Come on, give me some eyes!

1878
02:21:47,515 --> 02:21:49,255
Lydia.

1879
02:21:50,088 --> 02:21:52,817
This is my score.

1880
02:21:52,952 --> 02:21:55,162
Lydia, you're confused.

1881
02:21:55,297 --> 02:21:57,130
It's my score!

1882
02:21:57,266 --> 02:22:00,662
You fucking little nothing!

1883
02:22:08,944 --> 02:22:09,975
I'm fine.

1884
02:22:39,635 --> 02:22:42,241
You sign CAMI voucher.

1885
02:23:04,231 --> 02:23:06,697
Good afternoon. CAMI.

1886
02:23:06,833 --> 02:23:08,401
Hold on.

1887
02:23:09,337 --> 02:23:10,866
Normally, I'd think Lisa Rich

1888
02:23:11,002 --> 02:23:13,471
in our booking department
would be a great fit for you,

1889
02:23:13,606 --> 02:23:15,900
but she's just got
too much on her plate.

1890
02:23:16,036 --> 02:23:19,378
So, I'd like to team you
with Jake here.

1891
02:23:19,513 --> 02:23:21,915
Jake, you want to,
you want to show Lydia

1892
02:23:22,051 --> 02:23:23,549
what you've prepared for her?

1893
02:23:23,685 --> 02:23:25,884
Well...

1894
02:23:26,020 --> 02:23:28,320
right now it's a reset.

1895
02:23:28,455 --> 02:23:30,086
What we're after is less,
not more.

1896
02:23:30,222 --> 02:23:31,323
We want to be selective

1897
02:23:31,458 --> 02:23:33,389
and rebuild this
from the ground up.

1898
02:23:33,524 --> 02:23:35,526
That means we need a new story.

1899
02:23:40,035 --> 02:23:41,734
Just here.

1900
02:23:41,869 --> 02:23:43,464
Here. Thank you.

1901
02:23:43,599 --> 02:23:45,573
Make it 40.

1902
02:23:45,708 --> 02:23:47,274
Thank you.

1903
02:25:20,733 --> 02:25:22,660
Didn't you feel triumphant?

1904
02:25:26,170 --> 02:25:29,839
Now we can really understand
what the meaning of music is.

1905
02:25:29,974 --> 02:25:34,106
It's the way it makes you feel
when you hear it.

1906
02:25:34,241 --> 02:25:37,209
Finally, we've taken
that last giant step.

1907
02:25:37,344 --> 02:25:39,718
And we're there.
We know what music means now.

1908
02:25:39,854 --> 02:25:42,554
And we don't have to know
a lot of stuff about sharps

1909
02:25:42,689 --> 02:25:45,020
and flats and chords
and all that business

1910
02:25:45,156 --> 02:25:49,961
in order to understand music
if it tells us something.

1911
02:25:50,096 --> 02:25:53,534
And the most wonderful thing of
all is that there's no limit to

1912
02:25:53,669 --> 02:25:57,769
the different kinds of feelings
music can make you have.

1913
02:25:57,904 --> 02:26:01,705
And some of those feelings
are so special and so deep

1914
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:04,209
that they can't even be
described in words.

1915
02:26:04,345 --> 02:26:05,542
You see, we can't always name

1916
02:26:05,678 --> 02:26:06,946
the things we feel.

1917
02:26:07,081 --> 02:26:08,081
Sometimes we can.

1918
02:26:08,182 --> 02:26:09,548
We can say we feel joy,

1919
02:26:09,683 --> 02:26:13,382
pleasure, peacefulness,
whatever, love, hate.

1920
02:26:13,518 --> 02:26:15,620
But every once in a while,

1921
02:26:15,756 --> 02:26:18,455
we have feelings that are
so deep and so special

1922
02:26:18,590 --> 02:26:20,216
that we have no words for them.

1923
02:26:20,352 --> 02:26:23,228
And that's where music
is so marvelous,

1924
02:26:23,363 --> 02:26:25,496
because music names them for us,

1925
02:26:25,632 --> 02:26:28,431
only in notes
instead of in words.

1926
02:26:28,566 --> 02:26:29,964
It's all in the way music moves.

1927
02:26:30,099 --> 02:26:32,736
You must never forget
that music is movement,

1928
02:26:32,871 --> 02:26:35,573
always going somewhere,
shifting and changing

1929
02:26:35,709 --> 02:26:39,413
and flowing
from one note to another.

1930
02:26:39,548 --> 02:26:40,910
And that movement can tell us

1931
02:26:41,045 --> 02:26:44,174
more about the way we feel
than a million words can.

1932
02:26:44,310 --> 02:26:45,911
And here we're going
to play you a...

1933
02:27:00,396 --> 02:27:02,095
Tony.

1934
02:27:05,072 --> 02:27:06,201
Hi, Linda.

1935
02:27:06,336 --> 02:27:07,631
Sorry.

1936
02:27:07,766 --> 02:27:09,834
Lydia.

1937
02:27:09,969 --> 02:27:12,209
Ma said you'd be over.

1938
02:27:12,345 --> 02:27:14,679
You must be hiding out.

1939
02:27:15,448 --> 02:27:17,974
Why would I be hiding out?

1940
02:27:18,110 --> 02:27:20,186
Beats the hell out of me.

1941
02:27:20,321 --> 02:27:22,588
None of my business anyhow.

1942
02:27:23,657 --> 02:27:26,152
Lot of loose ends,
you got to admit.

1943
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:29,287
What do you mean?

1944
02:27:29,422 --> 02:27:31,632
Well, like I said,
it ain't my business.

1945
02:27:32,802 --> 02:27:34,962
But you don't seem to know
where the hell you came from

1946
02:27:35,093 --> 02:27:36,767
or where you're going.

1947
02:28:29,080 --> 02:28:30,821
May I come inside?

1948
02:28:32,093 --> 02:28:33,725
Thank you.

1949
02:28:45,668 --> 02:28:47,203
I'm so sorry.

1950
02:28:47,339 --> 02:28:49,873
We just wanted to confirm
that the composer was in fact

1951
02:28:50,008 --> 02:28:51,943
not flying in from Osaka
to attend the concert.

1952
02:28:53,674 --> 02:28:56,716
I must tell you that I
looked in the music libraries,

1953
02:28:56,851 --> 02:29:00,452
for her score,
but I couldn't find anything.

1954
02:29:00,587 --> 02:29:02,715
This just arrived.

1955
02:29:02,851 --> 02:29:05,053
That's great. Thank you.

1956
02:29:06,256 --> 02:29:08,728
Shirley and Cirio will be
most happy to show you

1957
02:29:08,863 --> 02:29:10,987
the sights of our beautiful country.
. Thank you.

1958
02:29:11,122 --> 02:29:12,790
Thank you so much.

1959
02:29:12,926 --> 02:29:14,935
Oh, goodness.

1960
02:29:15,070 --> 02:29:16,768
Thank-thank you.

1961
02:29:47,902 --> 02:29:51,995
Maybe we could stop somewhere
and take a swim.

1962
02:29:52,131 --> 02:29:53,602
Yeah, at the waterfall.

1963
02:29:53,738 --> 02:29:55,708
But not in the river.

1964
02:29:55,843 --> 02:29:58,278
Why? Is there something wrong
with the water?

1965
02:29:58,413 --> 02:30:01,012
N-No. There are crocodiles.

1966
02:30:03,114 --> 02:30:05,618
I didn't think
they'd be this far inland.

1967
02:30:05,754 --> 02:30:08,679
They escaped from
Marlon Brando movie.

1968
02:30:10,425 --> 02:30:13,191
That was a long time ago.

1969
02:30:13,327 --> 02:30:15,123
They survive.

1970
02:30:49,358 --> 02:30:51,830
Lady. Lady...

1971
02:30:53,830 --> 02:30:55,226
Here is prescription.

1972
02:30:55,361 --> 02:30:56,993
- Ten dollars.
- Thank you.

1973
02:30:58,401 --> 02:31:02,507
Is there somewhere
around here... thank you...

1974
02:31:02,642 --> 02:31:04,569
Where I could get a massage?

1975
02:31:04,704 --> 02:31:07,177
Was hoping it might help me
with this jet lag.

1976
02:31:11,317 --> 02:31:12,443
Yes.

1977
02:31:12,578 --> 02:31:15,253
There is
the very nice place I know.

1978
02:31:15,388 --> 02:31:17,018
Thank you.

1979
02:31:30,205 --> 02:31:31,405
Thank you.

1980
02:31:31,540 --> 02:31:33,305
Please step over
to the fishbowl.

1981
02:31:33,441 --> 02:31:35,207
The... the fishbowl?

1982
02:31:35,342 --> 02:31:37,007
Yes, over there.

1983
02:31:42,517 --> 02:31:43,748
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

1984
02:31:43,884 --> 02:31:46,082
H-How does this...
how does it work?

1985
02:31:46,884 --> 02:31:49,118
You just pick a number here.

1986
02:31:50,522 --> 02:31:52,453
I pick a number?

1987
02:31:52,589 --> 02:31:54,160
Yes.

1988
02:32:05,101 --> 02:32:07,367
Number five?

1989
02:32:50,748 --> 02:32:52,442
Good morning.

1990
02:32:52,577 --> 02:32:53,953
Good morning.

1991
02:32:54,089 --> 02:32:56,613
Now, before we begin,
let's-let's talk a bit about

1992
02:32:56,749 --> 02:33:00,255
the composer's intent
with this piece.

1993
02:33:01,596 --> 02:33:03,493
And what she might be after.

1994
02:33:22,608 --> 02:33:24,444
Five minutes.

1995
02:33:55,982 --> 02:33:57,983
Thank you.

1996
02:34:21,772 --> 02:34:25,776
Sisters and brothers
of the Fifth Fleet, it's time.

1997
02:34:25,911 --> 02:34:28,371
I'll keep my farewell brief.

1998
02:34:28,507 --> 02:34:30,973
Never was much with words.

1999
02:34:31,109 --> 02:34:35,112
Once you board this ship,
there's no turning back.

2000
02:34:35,247 --> 02:34:39,391
The next ground your feet touch
will be that of the New World.

2001
02:34:42,029 --> 02:34:43,886
If any of you
have lost your nerve,

2002
02:34:44,022 --> 02:34:48,257
then step away now
and let no one judge you.
