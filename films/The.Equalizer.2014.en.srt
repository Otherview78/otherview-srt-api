00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:28,796
Associate to builder services. Associate to builder services.

2
00:03:29,005 --> 00:03:31,799
- Right? - Yeah, and we'll cut it over here.

3
00:03:36,554 --> 00:03:38,181
Thought you finished this job.

4
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:40,975
The owner wants the driveway wider now.

5
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,854
- When they pay... - They say. Thank you.

6
00:03:45,063 --> 00:03:47,857
- They make the newer guys take tests. - Like firemen.

7
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:51,402
Yo, Pops, bet you didn't have to push dollies at your old job.

8
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:53,279
Guilty as charged.

9
00:04:04,415 --> 00:04:06,125
How you doing, Jenny?

10
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,087
Better now.

11
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:13,299
- Hi, Mr. McCall. - Ralphie.

12
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:14,968
- What you got there? - Tuna.

13
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:17,512
- Bread? - Whole-grain, gluten-free.

14
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,974
- Okay. Condiments? - Sprouts, avocado and Vegenaise mayo.

15
00:04:21,182 --> 00:04:22,642
Okay.

16
00:04:25,687 --> 00:04:26,980
A bone in the tuna.

17
00:04:33,361 --> 00:04:36,781
What? Potatoes are a vegetable. I like crunchy things.

18
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,158
Carrots are crunchy. Dried seaweed.

19
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:41,369
I'm a human, not a rabbit.

20
00:04:41,577 --> 00:04:44,372
To make security guard, you gotta lose weight.

21
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,167
Now, you asked me to help you, but if you don't apply yourself...

22
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:49,961
- Yeah. - Hey.

23
00:04:51,754 --> 00:04:53,339
Progress, not perfection.

24
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:58,928
- No more chips. - No more chips.

25
00:04:59,137 --> 00:05:00,638
Who needs flavour? Right?

26
00:05:00,638 --> 00:05:30,638
Subtitle www.movieddl.me

27
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:31,539
- All right, see you later, J. - Have a good one, Billy.

28
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:37,253
Fuck you.

29
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:45,595
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

30
00:07:53,144 --> 00:07:54,729
He catch that fish yet?

31
00:07:57,315 --> 00:07:58,566
Just hooked it.

32
00:07:58,774 --> 00:08:00,359
It's about damn time.

33
00:08:00,568 --> 00:08:04,488
Well, it's a big fish. Don't know if he can hang on, though.

34
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,491
Oh, no.

35
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,118
Tooth and nail right now.

36
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:12,246
Yeah, well, maybe he's just too old.

37
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:18,127
Thought you were gonna give up refined sugar.

38
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:20,004
- I am. - When?

39
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:22,673
- Any day now. - Yeah?

40
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:25,343
Bad for your vocal cords.

41
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,055
Body, mind, spirit, remember?

42
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:33,684
I bought a little machine for making demos.

43
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:36,437
Yeah? I bet you're good.

44
00:08:38,356 --> 00:08:39,690
What makes you say that?

45
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:42,401
Intuition.

46
00:08:50,618 --> 00:08:53,955
All right, well, I'll see you later, Jake.

47
00:08:55,498 --> 00:08:57,583
Okay. See you later, honey.

48
00:08:58,417 --> 00:09:01,712
You let me know what happens with that fish.

49
00:09:02,546 --> 00:09:05,299
- Okay. - All right, I'll see you.

50
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:09,637
Hey!

51
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,908
You'll owe me $100. Watch.

52
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:34,287
Hey, yo, Pops. We betting on what you did before you got here.

53
00:09:34,495 --> 00:09:37,415
- Like, for a living. - I'm saying insurance, claims.

54
00:09:37,623 --> 00:09:40,084
No. He was a stock dude, man, on Wall Street.

55
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:43,087
- I was a Pip. - Yo, you were a pimp?

56
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:46,048
No, not a pimp. A Pip. P-l-P. Pip.

57
00:09:46,257 --> 00:09:48,759
- The fuck is a Pip? - Why you curse so much?

58
00:09:48,968 --> 00:09:52,138
You know, like Gladys Knight and the Pips. Like this:

59
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:54,390
Check this out!

60
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:55,933
- Oh, come on! - Stop it.

61
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:59,478
- Yeah. Break it. - Don't do that right now. Don't do that.

62
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:01,147
- Oh, the spin? - What?

63
00:10:01,355 --> 00:10:04,650
- Wait a minute. - You're gonna blow the whistle?

64
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:08,863
Come on. I'm gonna look it up right now. Man, I'm looking this up.

65
00:10:10,531 --> 00:10:13,242
- Yo, so which one were you? - The one on the right.

66
00:10:13,451 --> 00:10:16,412
- Hey, do it again! - Yo, that's not him right there.

67
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,914
Man, that's him with an Afro.

68
00:10:19,123 --> 00:10:21,292
- He's bald. - So he had a wig on.

69
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,169
- That's gone, yo. - That's him.

70
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:42,438
Damn, girl! Bring it over here now!

71
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,152
Hey, Jake. What a fucking night.

72
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:50,780
Yeah, it's tough out there, honey.

73
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,161
Here you go, kid.

74
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,996
Thanks.

75
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:07,004
He ever catch it?

76
00:11:08,464 --> 00:11:12,259
- The fish. - Oh, yeah. Yes. Yeah, he did.

77
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:14,261
It's a happy ending.

78
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,806
Well, not exactly.

79
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:21,519
Old man tied the fish to the side of the boat, had to row back to shore...

80
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,979
...the fish bled in the water...

81
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:25,731
...sharks came...

82
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,318
...and ate the whole fish till there was nothing left.

83
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:33,531
- That's just kind of a waste, isn't it? - Depends upon how you look at it.

84
00:11:34,365 --> 00:11:38,744
The old man met his adversary when he thought that part of his life was over.

85
00:11:38,953 --> 00:11:41,080
And he saw himself in the fish.

86
00:11:41,747 --> 00:11:43,165
Came to...

87
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,419
Came to respect it the more it fought.

88
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:49,046
Why didn't he just let the fish go?

89
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:52,716
The old man's gotta be the old man. Fish gotta be the fish.

90
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:55,803
Gotta be who you are in this world, right?

91
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,930
No matter what.

92
00:12:16,157 --> 00:12:17,241
You've got a client.

93
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,160
I don't want to.

94
00:12:19,785 --> 00:12:21,036
What?

95
00:12:21,245 --> 00:12:23,497
Can't you get someone else?

96
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:24,748
He wants you.

97
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:27,042
But this customer is a pig.

98
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:29,211
He's waiting outside.

99
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:37,678
- How much? - Don't worry about it.

100
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:40,097
- Go make your living. - Thanks, Jake.

101
00:12:53,444 --> 00:12:57,698
Hey, honey! How you doing? You ready to have a good time?

102
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:07,333
Come on. Pull, pull, pull.

103
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,919
Pull, pull, pull!

104
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:11,462
Come on, come on.

105
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:16,509
Eight, seven, six, five...

106
00:13:16,717 --> 00:13:20,429
...four, four, four.

107
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:23,307
Come on, now. Come on.

108
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:25,643
- I can't. - You can't?

109
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,770
What if that were me?

110
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,565
You gonna leave me to die of smoke inhalation? I'm a buck-90.

111
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:35,528
How will you pull me out of a fire if you can't pull a tyre 20 yards?

112
00:13:35,736 --> 00:13:37,196
I'm not strong enough.

113
00:13:37,404 --> 00:13:42,159
Don't doubt yourself, son. Doubt kills. Get up. Come on. Get up. Get up.

114
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:44,328
Giddyup, giddyup, giddyup!

115
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:46,830
On your mark, get set...

116
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,374
...pull.

117
00:13:48,582 --> 00:13:50,751
Come on. Who's gonna make security guard?

118
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,211
I am!

119
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:55,130
- Who's gonna make security guard? - I am!

120
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:57,174
Who's gonna make security guard?

121
00:13:57,383 --> 00:13:59,134
- There you go. - I am!

122
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:02,263
I like it. Let's do it again.

123
00:14:22,538 --> 00:14:25,457
Loaded with poison, just like you like it.

124
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,626
Is it your birthday?

125
00:14:27,835 --> 00:14:31,088
No, it was some guy at work. I didn't want to waste it.

126
00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:34,592
Happy birthday, Some Guy at Work.

127
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,093
How old are you?

128
00:14:36,844 --> 00:14:38,095
How old are you?

129
00:14:38,304 --> 00:14:40,514
Doesn't really matter.

130
00:15:00,826 --> 00:15:03,329
I'm sorry. I'm breaking protocol, right?

131
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:05,664
No, no. Listen, hey, come on, sit down.

132
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:07,166
Sit. Sit.

133
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:08,667
Sit.

134
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:11,378
Okay.

135
00:15:12,671 --> 00:15:15,007
- Come on, sit down. - All right.

136
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:19,887
Sure I'm not interrupting anything?

137
00:15:20,095 --> 00:15:21,388
Yeah.

138
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:33,275
So?

139
00:15:33,943 --> 00:15:35,194
I don't know.

140
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:38,572
You know, I just kind of felt like a quiet voice.

141
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:41,992
Before it all goes crazy.

142
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:44,954
Okay.

143
00:15:45,162 --> 00:15:46,705
I'm Teri.

144
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:48,624
Bob.

145
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,046
- It's good. - You know, you don't look like a Bob.

146
00:15:54,255 --> 00:15:56,173
Oh, yeah? Thank you.

147
00:15:56,382 --> 00:15:58,467
You look like a Robert.

148
00:15:58,676 --> 00:16:01,345
Robert reads books like this...

149
00:16:01,553 --> 00:16:03,514
...and Bob watches TV.

150
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,106
My real name's Alina.

151
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:16,694
What happened to your face?

152
00:16:16,902 --> 00:16:19,071
Something stupid.

153
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:38,757
Look, it's not professional. Just tell me what you think, okay?

154
00:16:40,426 --> 00:16:42,594
Alina the singer.

155
00:16:44,305 --> 00:16:46,390
You and I know what I really am.

156
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:53,689
I think you can be anything you wanna be.

157
00:16:54,732 --> 00:16:56,442
Maybe in your world, Robert.

158
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,695
- Doesn't happen that way in mine. - Change your world.

159
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:07,786
There's no ring.

160
00:17:08,871 --> 00:17:11,832
- On your wedding finger, there's no ring. - No.

161
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,709
No Mrs. Robert at home?

162
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:15,210
No.

163
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:16,837
Was there ever?

164
00:17:18,088 --> 00:17:19,465
Once.

165
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:21,342
Did you break her heart?

166
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:25,804
She broke mine.

167
00:17:29,224 --> 00:17:31,977
You know, I see a lot of widowed guys.

168
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:37,524
Something in your eyes.

169
00:17:38,734 --> 00:17:40,611
You know, it's not sad.

170
00:17:41,487 --> 00:17:43,030
It's just kind of...

171
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:45,366
...lost, you know?

172
00:17:54,124 --> 00:17:55,584
You always read books?

173
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:58,629
My wife did. She...

174
00:17:59,505 --> 00:18:02,383
She was working through the 100 Books Everybody Should Read.

175
00:18:02,591 --> 00:18:05,469
She made it to 97, so I figured...

176
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:08,430
...I'd give it a shot.

177
00:18:12,184 --> 00:18:17,106
And one day we'd have something to talk about when we get together.

178
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:24,405
- Wow, a hundred books. - Yeah.

179
00:18:24,613 --> 00:18:26,740
Holy moly.

180
00:18:27,491 --> 00:18:30,327
- How many have you read, Robert? - Ninety-one.

181
00:18:32,454 --> 00:18:34,331
Sorry, this damn thing.

182
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,125
Ninety-one books, though.

183
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:39,211
- You're almost done. - Almost.

184
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,423
- What are you gonna do after that? - Singing lessons.

185
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:46,343
Then I'm gonna open a donut factory.

186
00:18:47,094 --> 00:18:49,847
I am. What? Why you laughing?

187
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,693
- You know, I love being up at this hour. - Yeah?

188
00:19:02,901 --> 00:19:05,195
Yeah. You know, everything's so dark.

189
00:19:05,404 --> 00:19:08,198
It makes everything seem possible again.

190
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:11,952
Yeah, me, I can't sleep at night.

191
00:19:13,162 --> 00:19:15,956
Yeah, well, I get to hear your stories.

192
00:19:16,165 --> 00:19:17,541
What's your new one about?

193
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:21,336
Oh, it's about a guy who thinks he's a knight in shining arm our.

194
00:19:21,545 --> 00:19:26,383
The only thing is, he lives in a world where knights don't exist anymore.

195
00:19:27,217 --> 00:19:29,344
Kind of sounds like my world.

196
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,390
I'm just up the block.

197
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,601
I'm gonna grab a cab or something.

198
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:39,146
Thank you for the quiet voice, Robert.

199
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:42,733
You are very welcome, Alina.

200
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:44,276
Yeah.

201
00:19:44,485 --> 00:19:46,820
- Catch you around, all right? - Good night.

202
00:19:48,113 --> 00:19:49,573
Shit.

203
00:19:49,781 --> 00:19:51,408
See you.

204
00:19:55,078 --> 00:19:56,830
What did you do, huh?

205
00:19:58,373 --> 00:20:00,167
What did you do to that customer?

206
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,169
Slavi, he hit me.

207
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:06,590
- Who the fuck you think you are? - It's all right.

208
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:07,883
Understand.

209
00:20:08,383 --> 00:20:09,426
It's all right, Robert.

210
00:20:09,635 --> 00:20:11,512
Let's talk about you not answering my calls.

211
00:20:14,932 --> 00:20:16,183
Bitch!

212
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,185
Should we give him a card?

213
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:23,649
This girl, she's no good.

214
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:28,654
Call this number. I send you another one. Better.

215
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:37,663
Don't be shy... Make the call.

216
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:39,206
Understand.

217
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:29,214
Coffee?

218
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:31,133
We need more sugar out here.

219
00:21:53,905 --> 00:21:57,743
I heard she's at the ICU at Shawmuts. Someone beat her up real good.

220
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:10,672
Dr. Paley to ICU. Dr. Paley to ICU, please.

221
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:18,972
Dr. Mark to the pharmacy. Dr. Mark to the pharmacy, please.

222
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:31,902
Alina.

223
00:22:53,048 --> 00:22:57,094
You'll be okay, Alina. You'll be okay.

224
00:23:24,788 --> 00:23:27,290
Watch it. Don't you worry about it.

225
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:30,335
- It's okay. It's okay. - Here you go.

226
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:34,423
- I can-- It's fine. Thank you. - Got it.

227
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:37,300
How's she doing?

228
00:23:39,553 --> 00:23:40,846
Alina. How's she doing?

229
00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:44,975
- Who are you? - Just a friend.

230
00:23:52,983 --> 00:23:54,609
A guy hit her.

231
00:23:57,237 --> 00:23:59,322
And she hit him back.

232
00:23:59,531 --> 00:24:01,908
A guy called Slavi.

233
00:24:04,286 --> 00:24:06,955
So Slavi made example of her.

234
00:24:08,373 --> 00:24:09,916
They do that.

235
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:13,378
They burned one girl's face with battery acid.

236
00:24:14,087 --> 00:24:17,758
Keep her around as a reminder for the rest of us.

237
00:24:20,677 --> 00:24:23,221
They brought Teri over very young.

238
00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:26,600
Think she got to the point where...

239
00:24:26,808 --> 00:24:30,020
...she thought her life could be hers one day.

240
00:24:30,228 --> 00:24:32,939
Slavi reminded her it never would be.

241
00:24:35,692 --> 00:24:38,278
He said he'd cut her throat next time.

242
00:24:40,238 --> 00:24:45,035
He said a whore who fucks and can't talk might be worth twice as much.

243
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,874
You and I know what I really am.

244
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:35,585
It's something in your eyes.

245
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:38,505
Change your world. Anything you wanna be.

246
00:25:38,713 --> 00:25:41,466
He said he'd cut her throat next time.

247
00:25:58,692 --> 00:26:02,821
Why is that piece of shit in my parking space?

248
00:26:08,994 --> 00:26:10,328
Hi, Slavi.

249
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:15,458
- Are they upstairs? - Yes.

250
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:37,898
Tevi. You collect from that fuck, Dmitri?

251
00:26:38,106 --> 00:26:39,649
Yes.

252
00:26:39,858 --> 00:26:41,234
He asked for forgiveness.

253
00:26:43,528 --> 00:26:45,071
Forgiveness?

254
00:26:46,197 --> 00:26:48,658
I told him.

255
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:51,202
What am I, Jesus Christ?

256
00:27:12,686 --> 00:27:13,979
You lost, dedushka?

257
00:27:15,021 --> 00:27:17,607
- How the fuck did he get up here? - I don't know.

258
00:27:18,024 --> 00:27:19,401
Should I get rid of him?

259
00:27:21,611 --> 00:27:22,696
No.

260
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,367
I'm here for that girl.

261
00:27:29,327 --> 00:27:31,663
You gave me that a couple of nights ago.

262
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,542
We give out lots of cards.

263
00:27:36,126 --> 00:27:38,587
You still can get it up, dedushka?

264
00:27:42,966 --> 00:27:45,218
I'm here about a certain girl.

265
00:27:45,927 --> 00:27:48,430
She got beat up pretty bad.

266
00:27:49,431 --> 00:27:53,560
I'm thinking that maybe you have wrong address, dedushka.

267
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:02,652
This girl, she have name?

268
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:05,530
- Her name's Alina. - Alina?

269
00:28:07,407 --> 00:28:09,034
No, it doesn't ring a bell.

270
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:13,413
But whoever she is, I'm sure she must know how to suck the cock.

271
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:22,881
Okay.

272
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:26,468
Look, I understand.

273
00:28:26,676 --> 00:28:28,595
These girls that you...

274
00:28:29,471 --> 00:28:31,139
That you represent.

275
00:28:31,348 --> 00:28:35,435
I understand it's like they're an investment, so...

276
00:28:36,812 --> 00:28:39,356
...I can give you $9800.

277
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:42,526
It's cash.

278
00:28:43,652 --> 00:28:45,779
You're wanting to give me $9000?

279
00:28:45,987 --> 00:28:48,114
Ninety-eight hundred. Cash.

280
00:28:49,157 --> 00:28:51,493
- For what? - Her freedom.

281
00:28:53,703 --> 00:28:55,247
Can you believe this guy?

282
00:28:56,456 --> 00:29:00,126
This guy gonna give me $9000 for one single piece of pussy.

283
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:03,713
Must be Ferrari pussy.

284
00:29:07,926 --> 00:29:10,971
You fucking Americans think you can come into my place...

285
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:12,722
...and buy whatever you want.

286
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:16,977
Beautiful Russian girls, no problem, just throw down this bullshit money.

287
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:22,566
You fucking insult me.

288
00:29:34,578 --> 00:29:36,705
I'm just fucking with you, man.

289
00:29:36,913 --> 00:29:41,042
But you got very big balls coming in here. I like that.

290
00:29:41,251 --> 00:29:42,627
So...

291
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,256
...$9000 for the troublemaker.

292
00:29:59,477 --> 00:30:01,146
One month.

293
00:30:01,354 --> 00:30:02,772
That's it.

294
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:05,108
You think this is one-time payment?

295
00:30:05,317 --> 00:30:09,487
I make this off this girl in two weeks. That girl is still child.

296
00:30:10,113 --> 00:30:12,240
I still can sell her as virgin.

297
00:30:12,824 --> 00:30:14,910
This makes prime earner for good while.

298
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:24,044
Take your fucking money and go back to your house and jerk off 9800 times.

299
00:30:24,252 --> 00:30:26,630
Then come crawling back here and talk to me.

300
00:30:26,838 --> 00:30:28,965
She'll be used up by then for sure.

301
00:30:29,174 --> 00:30:31,760
Maybe then I will let you have her for nothing.

302
00:30:45,523 --> 00:30:46,858
Okay.

303
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:06,628
You're okay, dedushka? Bye-bye.

304
00:31:06,836 --> 00:31:08,630
You know amerikantsy.

305
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:30,860
You forget something?

306
00:32:14,571 --> 00:32:16,364
Sixteen seconds.

307
00:32:19,034 --> 00:32:20,285
One one-thousand...

308
00:32:20,493 --> 00:32:23,621
...two one-thousand, three one-thousand.

309
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,663
Eight one-thousand.

310
00:33:10,126 --> 00:33:11,503
Understand?

311
00:33:22,806 --> 00:33:25,600
Twenty-eight minus 9, 19.

312
00:33:29,187 --> 00:33:30,480
Nineteen.

313
00:33:48,164 --> 00:33:50,792
Your heart's beating three times the normal rate.

314
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,294
Because you're losing so much blood.

315
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,091
About 30 seconds, your body's gonna shut down...

316
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:00,593
...and you're gonna suffocate.

317
00:34:01,594 --> 00:34:04,806
Alina, the girl you beat half to death, her life will go on.

318
00:34:05,014 --> 00:34:08,893
Yours is gonna end right here, on this funky floor...

319
00:34:09,102 --> 00:34:11,104
...over $9800.

320
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:16,109
You should have taken the money.

321
00:34:19,445 --> 00:34:21,865
Who are you?

322
00:34:23,074 --> 00:34:25,076
Twenty-six one-thousand...

323
00:34:25,285 --> 00:34:27,704
...27 one-thousand...

324
00:34:27,912 --> 00:34:30,415
...28 one-thousand.

325
00:34:39,966 --> 00:34:41,467
I'm sorry.

326
00:35:48,785 --> 00:35:51,246
Mr. McCall, it's lunchtime.

327
00:35:52,622 --> 00:35:53,873
Mr. McCall.

328
00:35:54,082 --> 00:35:55,458
Lunchtime.

329
00:35:59,295 --> 00:36:01,464
You test tomorrow and you're eating that?

330
00:36:01,673 --> 00:36:03,174
These are for you.

331
00:36:05,718 --> 00:36:07,011
Open it.

332
00:36:12,642 --> 00:36:14,435
I made the weight.

333
00:36:14,644 --> 00:36:17,563
Tomorrow I'm gonna ace that test. Thanks to you.

334
00:36:18,523 --> 00:36:19,816
What happened?

335
00:36:21,317 --> 00:36:23,569
Hit it on something stupid.

336
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:59,939
In what investigators are calling a gangland-style execution...

337
00:37:00,148 --> 00:37:02,859
...five men were killed at some point last night...

338
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:05,111
...in an office above this restaurant.

339
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,615
Police sources have said the killings have all the earmarks of a turf war...

340
00:37:09,824 --> 00:37:13,161
...between rival factions. Names are not yet being released--

341
00:37:31,888 --> 00:37:33,139
How's it going?

342
00:37:33,348 --> 00:37:37,393
- How you doing, sir? Morgan Pederson. - I know who you are. Get in the car.

343
00:37:43,775 --> 00:37:46,486
Take me to the murder scene.

344
00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:02,854
We figured two, maybe three, guys killed them all that quickly.

345
00:39:03,062 --> 00:39:05,440
If it was a power play, no one saw it coming.

346
00:39:05,648 --> 00:39:08,443
None of our informants heard about this going down.

347
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:11,737
Security system's drive was taken so we're blind in here.

348
00:39:11,946 --> 00:39:15,616
At 11 :17, a waiter goes up with a tray of food, finds them dead.

349
00:39:15,825 --> 00:39:20,288
I want images from every security camera within a six-block radius.

350
00:39:20,496 --> 00:39:24,125
If you have any trouble, call that number...

351
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:27,753
...and it will be taken care of.

352
00:39:27,962 --> 00:39:31,299
Phones charged and on. I tend to call at odd hours.

353
00:39:31,507 --> 00:39:34,510
Now, if you could drive me to my residence.

354
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:38,055
Hey, wait a second, Mr. Sunshine.

355
00:39:38,264 --> 00:39:40,433
What do I look like to you? A chauffeur?

356
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,565
This is our town. You're a fucking guest.

357
00:39:55,031 --> 00:39:56,949
Let me apologise for my conduct.

358
00:39:57,158 --> 00:40:03,206
It was a long flight on short notice, and I like to focus, to work quickly.

359
00:40:03,414 --> 00:40:07,210
The deaths of Mr. Pushkin's men have interrupted his operations here.

360
00:40:07,418 --> 00:40:10,880
Imports, movements of goods, have all ceased.

361
00:40:11,088 --> 00:40:12,465
That's unacceptable.

362
00:40:12,673 --> 00:40:16,302
I'm the one Mr. Pushkin calls in when people like you fuck up.

363
00:40:17,011 --> 00:40:19,514
- I'm accountable now. - I don't like your tone--

364
00:40:19,722 --> 00:40:22,850
You have taken Mr. Pushkin's money for years.

365
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:26,938
Money that comes with conditions. Non-negotiable conditions.

366
00:40:27,146 --> 00:40:30,650
Problem you're having with me is you think you matter. You don't.

367
00:40:30,858 --> 00:40:34,028
I am all that matters. And so we're clear:

368
00:40:34,237 --> 00:40:37,573
I'm not here to say "please."

369
00:40:38,574 --> 00:40:40,535
I'm here to tell you what to do.

370
00:40:45,665 --> 00:40:47,458
Be ready for business.

371
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:49,335
We open tomorrow.

372
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:58,594
Brian, you seen Ralphie? Supposed to be taking that security guard test.

373
00:40:58,803 --> 00:41:00,638
- Called in and quit. - Quit?

374
00:41:00,846 --> 00:41:03,724
No notice either. Kids, right?

375
00:41:24,287 --> 00:41:25,621
We're closed.

376
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,665
- Mr. McCall. - Ralphie.

377
00:41:27,873 --> 00:41:30,126
Heard you quit today. I got worried.

378
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:34,839
Oh, my mom had a little accident here last night.

379
00:41:35,047 --> 00:41:36,632
There was a fire.

380
00:41:37,633 --> 00:41:40,678
- I see. - So I'm gonna help out around here now.

381
00:41:43,222 --> 00:41:44,682
Okay.

382
00:42:00,364 --> 00:42:02,575
- We have a lot of work to do. - Okay.

383
00:42:02,783 --> 00:42:04,910
- Yeah, so... - Need some help?

384
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,496
Yeah, if you're not busy, that'd be awesome.

385
00:42:07,705 --> 00:42:08,998
Helping you.

386
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:23,512
Teddy, the Irish are clean on this one. They had nothing to do with it, huh?

387
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:25,765
You gonna sit down with all these guys?

388
00:42:25,973 --> 00:42:30,394
- I'm telling you. - Yes, I understand. Duly noted.

389
00:42:55,419 --> 00:42:58,631
Listen, huh? Do me a favour, all right?

390
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:02,426
Whatever you do, don't call him "Little John," okay?

391
00:43:02,635 --> 00:43:06,347
Frank, why you working for these fucking Russians?

392
00:43:07,056 --> 00:43:08,391
My money not good enough?

393
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:11,936
- John, I got respect for your business. - Mr. Looney.

394
00:43:12,853 --> 00:43:16,982
You understand why I'm compelled to make this visit.

395
00:43:17,191 --> 00:43:21,362
I don't know shit about what went down or who you should be out looking for.

396
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:24,907
If I wanna take over anything, I'd fucking do it.

397
00:43:25,116 --> 00:43:26,951
There'd be nothing left to you.

398
00:43:27,159 --> 00:43:30,287
So maybe you just don't understand who the fuck I am.

399
00:43:30,496 --> 00:43:31,747
John. Easy, huh?

400
00:43:31,956 --> 00:43:35,376
Don't "easy," Frank. Shut the fuck up! Fucking flipper head.

401
00:43:35,584 --> 00:43:38,045
See, I hate you fucking Russians.

402
00:43:38,254 --> 00:43:40,756
You're all crazy and you're arrogant.

403
00:43:40,965 --> 00:43:45,136
Now, the Irish, we came here for a piece of the American dream.

404
00:43:45,344 --> 00:43:49,056
You people come over here to steal it. So fuck all of you.

405
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:51,642
Well, Mr. Looney, I appreciate your candour.

406
00:43:51,851 --> 00:43:56,814
It's refreshing, and tells me that you're not smart enough to have done this.

407
00:43:57,022 --> 00:43:59,400
- The fuck? - Which brings me to my next issue.

408
00:43:59,608 --> 00:44:03,529
We pay you 15 percent to do business here.

409
00:44:03,738 --> 00:44:06,240
The additional 10 percent you steal, we ignore.

410
00:44:06,449 --> 00:44:09,160
We anticipated it, as you people are such clichés.

411
00:44:09,368 --> 00:44:13,164
The fact that you're a rat to the Feds is also tolerable, Little John.

412
00:44:13,372 --> 00:44:15,708
- The fuck? - What we will not tolerate is...

413
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:19,462
...getting nothing for our money: no information, no protection...

414
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:22,965
...no assurances. You understand, Little Johnny?

415
00:44:23,174 --> 00:44:25,676
- Who do you think are? - Who I am? Or what I am?

416
00:44:25,885 --> 00:44:30,014
Who I am is complicated. What I am is easier. I'm a threat.

417
00:44:30,222 --> 00:44:33,225
- I alter outcomes. - Throw this motherf--

418
00:44:41,859 --> 00:44:45,362
Whoa, doctor! Call a doctor. Unbelievable!

419
00:44:45,571 --> 00:44:47,364
It's Napoli in the clutch!

420
00:44:47,573 --> 00:44:49,158
Holy cow!

421
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:53,871
Oh, fuck!

422
00:44:55,915 --> 00:44:57,458
A tie game. Unbelievable!

423
00:44:57,666 --> 00:45:01,295
That ball was absolutely massacred by Mike Napoli.

424
00:45:07,676 --> 00:45:08,969
A home run by Napoli.

425
00:45:09,178 --> 00:45:12,181
-Can things change in an instant. - They certainly can.

426
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:15,267
This game was over before this half-inning started.

427
00:45:15,476 --> 00:45:16,894
It is certainly over now!

428
00:45:17,102 --> 00:45:20,356
The final: six to five, Boston over New York...

429
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:29,532
Hey!

430
00:45:30,074 --> 00:45:32,493
Hey! Hey.

431
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:35,663
This is my town. Do you understand me? This is my home.

432
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,290
You cannot run around like a wild animal.

433
00:45:38,499 --> 00:45:40,209
What the fuck was that?

434
00:45:40,417 --> 00:45:41,961
It's a message.

435
00:45:42,503 --> 00:45:45,047
It says, "I'm here."

436
00:45:55,766 --> 00:45:58,185
What really happened in there, Ralphie?

437
00:46:00,813 --> 00:46:02,857
Faulty wire or something.

438
00:46:03,065 --> 00:46:04,692
We both know that's not true.

439
00:46:07,486 --> 00:46:11,282
- I'm sorry I wasted your time. - Hey, you didn't waste my time.

440
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:15,077
My mom doesn't have much except this place.

441
00:46:15,286 --> 00:46:19,123
When stuff like this happens, I just gotta put everything on hold...

442
00:46:19,331 --> 00:46:21,417
...and help her out, you know?

443
00:46:23,168 --> 00:46:26,338
I wasn't gonna pass the security guard test anyway.

444
00:46:32,219 --> 00:46:36,724
Was there anything unusually strange about Slavi before he was murdered?

445
00:46:38,058 --> 00:46:42,187
Did he mention a name perhaps? Agitated about something?

446
00:46:42,396 --> 00:46:46,150
Slavi never did his business in front of the girls.

447
00:46:46,358 --> 00:46:47,651
Tevi handled us.

448
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:52,448
We can't locate one of the other girls from Slavi's stable. Teri.

449
00:46:56,076 --> 00:46:58,162
- You know her? - No.

450
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:01,373
- Where we might find her? - No. Sorry.

451
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:05,210
I didn't know her that well.

452
00:47:12,217 --> 00:47:14,303
Was my message received, Teddy?

453
00:47:14,511 --> 00:47:16,180
Yes, Mr. Pushkin.

454
00:47:16,388 --> 00:47:19,516
All of our associates-- Irish, Italians, Armenians.

455
00:47:19,725 --> 00:47:22,603
- -Are all denying any knowledge or involvement.

456
00:47:23,479 --> 00:47:26,982
We cannot show weakness. I need this wrapped up quickly.

457
00:47:27,191 --> 00:47:28,859
It will be.

458
00:47:29,068 --> 00:47:31,528
Of course, don't worry.

459
00:47:31,737 --> 00:47:32,988
Good.

460
00:47:33,197 --> 00:47:35,199
Now enough of what you don't know.

461
00:47:35,407 --> 00:47:37,409
Tell me what you do know.

462
00:47:39,453 --> 00:47:44,041
Well, I'm still sifting through things, but the killings were spontaneous.

463
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:48,379
Whoever did this specialised in killing.

464
00:47:49,046 --> 00:47:51,382
I've rarely seen skills like this.

465
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:54,385
I don't think it's someone we've encountered before.

466
00:47:54,593 --> 00:47:57,012
Whoever it is, just find him, Teddy.

467
00:47:57,221 --> 00:48:00,057
I'm talking over a million barrels this delivery.

468
00:48:00,265 --> 00:48:02,893
- Understand? - It will all be well.

469
00:48:03,102 --> 00:48:04,687
I'll take care of it.

470
00:48:05,521 --> 00:48:07,898
When you do, be loud about it.

471
00:48:08,107 --> 00:48:10,192
I don't want this happening again.

472
00:48:10,401 --> 00:48:12,027
Of course.

473
00:48:54,278 --> 00:48:55,779
Come on.

474
00:48:55,988 --> 00:48:57,281
Stuff it in.

475
00:48:57,489 --> 00:48:59,033
See that there?

476
00:48:59,241 --> 00:49:01,160
That son of a bitch.

477
00:49:01,952 --> 00:49:04,121
- Yeah. - Come on.

478
00:49:10,044 --> 00:49:12,671
- We're closed. Get out. - Let's go.

479
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,298
Time to go.

480
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,925
Nice to see you.

481
00:49:26,685 --> 00:49:29,938
See? You pay on time, no more problems.

482
00:49:30,147 --> 00:49:31,732
All right, let's go.

483
00:49:33,984 --> 00:49:36,737
Mamacita, you need to clean the grease.

484
00:49:36,945 --> 00:49:38,864
- It'll cause a fire. - Good accent.

485
00:49:39,073 --> 00:49:40,324
See you next week.

486
00:49:43,252 --> 00:49:45,379
- Let's go get a blowie. - Hey, officers.

487
00:49:45,588 --> 00:49:48,466
Whoa, put the light down. What's up?

488
00:49:48,674 --> 00:49:52,011
- I'd like to report a crime. - Really? Call 911.

489
00:49:52,219 --> 00:49:54,221
Let's get out of here. Fuck that guy.

490
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:57,308
- I should have shot that motherfucker. - Take it easy.

491
00:49:58,476 --> 00:50:01,604
- How did you get this job? - I blew the commissioner.

492
00:50:03,314 --> 00:50:04,690
Why waste city services...

493
00:50:04,899 --> 00:50:07,693
...when I got two corrupt cops right in front of me?

494
00:50:07,902 --> 00:50:09,820
- It's that guy. - This fucking guy?

495
00:50:10,029 --> 00:50:12,073
- Yeah. - Back up.

496
00:50:24,293 --> 00:50:26,128
How'd you get that fucking number?

497
00:50:26,337 --> 00:50:28,130
- Wasn't hard. - Yeah?

498
00:50:28,339 --> 00:50:31,384
- Neither was this. - Ask the lady down the street.

499
00:50:31,592 --> 00:50:33,386
The one who had the fire?

500
00:50:33,594 --> 00:50:36,889
Same thing could happen to you with your whole family inside.

501
00:50:37,098 --> 00:50:39,642
-Open it. - You pay like everybody else.

502
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:42,144
How many copies?

503
00:50:43,854 --> 00:50:45,147
One.

504
00:50:45,606 --> 00:50:47,316
You must have a death wish, pal.

505
00:50:47,525 --> 00:50:50,736
What the fuck do you want, huh?

506
00:50:50,945 --> 00:50:52,947
The people you took the money from...

507
00:50:53,155 --> 00:50:55,992
- ...you should give it back. - Why would we do that?

508
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,703
That would be in the best interest of everyone.

509
00:50:58,911 --> 00:51:00,287
- Really? - Yeah.

510
00:51:00,496 --> 00:51:03,624
Maybe our best interest is to tie a block around you...

511
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:05,876
...and throw you in the Mystic, huh?

512
00:51:06,085 --> 00:51:09,255
Let's do that. It's a good idea.

513
00:51:16,554 --> 00:51:19,056
You're supposed to stand for something, punk.

514
00:51:19,265 --> 00:51:20,558
Fuck.

515
00:51:21,767 --> 00:51:23,894
Protect and serve. Uphold the law.

516
00:51:24,687 --> 00:51:25,938
Justice.

517
00:51:26,147 --> 00:51:27,773
Remember?

518
00:51:36,032 --> 00:51:37,324
Who the fuck are you?

519
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,289
Tomorrow you'll have returned all the money you extorted from those people.

520
00:51:43,497 --> 00:51:45,499
Tell them it will never happen again.

521
00:51:45,708 --> 00:51:48,461
Do that, and this video will never be seen.

522
00:51:48,669 --> 00:51:52,173
Don't, and a half an hour later you'll watch the uncut version...

523
00:51:52,381 --> 00:51:54,508
...on every news outlet in the area.

524
00:51:55,217 --> 00:51:59,472
Now I'm offering you a chance to do the right thing. Take it.

525
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,308
That fucking hurt more than the beating.

526
00:52:17,156 --> 00:52:20,409
Mr. McCall. Are you done standing around or what?

527
00:52:30,461 --> 00:52:32,546
All the other girls have...

528
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:37,301
...claimed that you were very close to Teri.

529
00:52:43,641 --> 00:52:45,684
You lied to me about that.

530
00:52:53,776 --> 00:52:55,069
It's pretty.

531
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:11,335
When did you last talk to her?

532
00:53:13,587 --> 00:53:16,257
Over a week ago.

533
00:53:19,552 --> 00:53:21,220
I went to the hospital.

534
00:53:22,847 --> 00:53:24,265
I saw her there.

535
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:27,393
Did anyone else visit her?

536
00:53:28,477 --> 00:53:29,728
Yes.

537
00:53:29,937 --> 00:53:31,605
- A man. - A man?

538
00:53:31,814 --> 00:53:33,983
- Customer? - No.

539
00:53:34,191 --> 00:53:36,193
A nice man. A black man.

540
00:53:36,402 --> 00:53:38,863
He wanted to know what happened to her.

541
00:53:39,071 --> 00:53:40,364
His name?

542
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,908
He didn't say.

543
00:53:45,995 --> 00:53:47,746
And your friend, Teri?

544
00:53:47,955 --> 00:53:50,916
No one saw her after she left hospital.

545
00:53:52,126 --> 00:53:54,170
After what they did to her.

546
00:53:55,254 --> 00:53:57,298
- And you contacted her? - No.

547
00:53:57,506 --> 00:53:59,175
No one saw her.

548
00:54:00,217 --> 00:54:02,761
Look at me. Are you telling me the truth?

549
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,639
- You telling me the truth? The truth? - Yes. Yes.

550
00:54:05,848 --> 00:54:07,766
- You telling me the truth? - Yes.

551
00:54:08,601 --> 00:54:10,853
- Telling me the truth? - Yes!

552
00:54:21,697 --> 00:54:23,365
Would you like some water?

553
00:54:25,284 --> 00:54:27,119
Moisten your throat.

554
00:54:35,044 --> 00:54:36,337
Thank you.

555
00:54:37,546 --> 00:54:38,839
Sweet.

556
00:54:40,257 --> 00:54:41,550
My angel.

557
00:54:43,552 --> 00:54:45,638
- Yes. - Please. Please.

558
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:53,729
- So beautiful. So beautiful. - Please, please, Teddy. Please, Teddy.

559
00:54:53,938 --> 00:54:56,232
- But so deceitful. - Please. Please don't.

560
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,734
- So fucking deceitful. - Please don't.

561
00:54:58,943 --> 00:55:01,570
You're-- You're hurting me!

562
00:55:01,779 --> 00:55:03,614
Please stop.

563
00:55:45,447 --> 00:55:46,782
Let's go, Home Mart!

564
00:55:46,991 --> 00:55:49,243
- Let's go! - Keep it going, Home Mart!

565
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,373
Here we go. I got it! I got it! I got it!

566
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:57,084
Yeah!

567
00:55:57,293 --> 00:55:58,752
Yeah!

568
00:55:59,461 --> 00:56:01,672
There you go! Way to go, Bobby!

569
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,966
There's no place like Home Mart.

570
00:56:07,636 --> 00:56:08,929
Yeah!

571
00:56:15,644 --> 00:56:18,981
- I see you! - Ralphie, bravo!

572
00:56:19,565 --> 00:56:21,442
You passed your test!

573
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:23,110
Looking good, man.

574
00:56:23,319 --> 00:56:25,029
Hey, did they give you a gun?

575
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:39,543
What the hell he call us in here for?

576
00:56:39,752 --> 00:56:42,296
Maybe he's finally done chasing his own tail.

577
00:56:42,504 --> 00:56:45,549
- He needs to go home. - Waste of fucking time.

578
00:56:45,758 --> 00:56:47,593
Yeah, that sounds about right.

579
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:51,055
I matched the arrival and departure times...

580
00:56:51,263 --> 00:56:54,475
...of everyone going in and out of the restaurant.

581
00:56:54,683 --> 00:56:59,229
This person walks in the front door several minutes after Slavi arrived...

582
00:56:59,438 --> 00:57:01,231
...but never comes out.

583
00:57:05,736 --> 00:57:08,072
- All right. Later. All right. - Thanks.

584
00:57:11,658 --> 00:57:13,327
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny.

585
00:57:13,535 --> 00:57:15,871
Can you do a quick card refund for me?

586
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,041
- Gentleman's in a hurry. - Open that fucking register.

587
00:57:20,418 --> 00:57:23,088
Move, move. Empty the register. Now.

588
00:57:23,296 --> 00:57:25,507
Go ahead, open this thing up.

589
00:57:25,715 --> 00:57:29,761
Tell this bitch to fucking move it. Open the register up right now.

590
00:57:31,846 --> 00:57:33,181
Move.

591
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:37,185
All of it. Give me all of it.

592
00:57:40,689 --> 00:57:42,857
Come on. Move, move, move.

593
00:57:46,695 --> 00:57:49,239
- That ring too. Give me that ring. - No.

594
00:57:49,447 --> 00:57:52,158
- Give me that fucking ring, I said. - Please.

595
00:57:52,367 --> 00:57:53,868
It was my mother's.

596
00:57:54,077 --> 00:57:56,329
Fuck your mother. Give me that ring.

597
00:58:28,111 --> 00:58:30,196
- Take it off. - It was my mother's.

598
00:58:30,405 --> 00:58:32,866
I don't care. Give me the fucking ring.

599
00:58:33,825 --> 00:58:35,952
- Please. - It's okay, Jenny.

600
00:59:12,489 --> 00:59:13,573
You okay?

601
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:15,283
Yeah.

602
00:59:21,539 --> 00:59:25,376
Hey, listen. Police said the guy's done four like this.

603
00:59:25,585 --> 00:59:28,630
Shot a guy over in Somerville a month ago, so...

604
00:59:30,381 --> 00:59:31,800
It's only money.

605
01:00:25,353 --> 01:00:28,273
- You okay? - Hey, Ralphie. Still a little freaked out.

606
01:00:28,481 --> 01:00:31,192
Well, if you need anything, let me know.

607
01:00:31,401 --> 01:00:32,819
Thanks, Ralphie.

608
01:00:37,866 --> 01:00:39,450
Oh, my God.

609
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:42,579
My ring?

610
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:42,013
- Mr. McCall. Sorry to bother you. - Yeah.

611
01:01:42,222 --> 01:01:45,350
We're looking into a homicide that occurred two weeks ago.

612
01:01:45,558 --> 01:01:47,894
Five dead. Russian restaurant.

613
01:01:48,102 --> 01:01:51,231
I heard about it on TV. I happened to be there that night.

614
01:01:51,439 --> 01:01:52,690
- Oh, you were? - Yeah.

615
01:01:52,899 --> 01:01:55,360
- You wouldn't be here if I wasn't. - Right.

616
01:01:55,568 --> 01:01:59,864
We're just checking to see if anyone remembered anything suspicious.

617
01:02:00,073 --> 01:02:01,449
Not that I recall.

618
01:02:01,658 --> 01:02:04,577
May I ask why you dined at that particular restaurant?

619
01:02:04,786 --> 01:02:06,037
I like pirozhki.

620
01:02:06,246 --> 01:02:10,083
There's five Russian restaurants in walking distance of your apartment.

621
01:02:10,291 --> 01:02:12,627
I assume they all serve pirozhki.

622
01:02:13,461 --> 01:02:15,588
I was meeting a friend. It was her idea.

623
01:02:15,797 --> 01:02:18,299
- Then I guess I should talk-- - Sheila Saunders.

624
01:02:18,508 --> 01:02:22,512
But she can't help. She wasn't there. Her daughter had a fever.

625
01:02:24,514 --> 01:02:26,933
- Didn't stay long? - I didn't check my watch.

626
01:02:27,141 --> 01:02:29,394
I see. Well, thanks for your cooperation.

627
01:02:29,602 --> 01:02:33,815
- Very welcome. - Tell me, do you know this girl?

628
01:02:36,776 --> 01:02:39,404
Yeah, I don't know...

629
01:02:39,612 --> 01:02:42,115
I don't remember where from. What happened?

630
01:02:42,323 --> 01:02:44,993
- She fell down and broke her neck. - Did she?

631
01:02:45,868 --> 01:02:47,704
I'll be in touch.

632
01:02:47,912 --> 01:02:50,540
Don't you wanna leave me your card, officer?

633
01:02:50,748 --> 01:02:54,752
In case I remember anything? That's what policemen usually do, right?

634
01:02:54,961 --> 01:02:58,131
- Must have given them all out. - How'd you find me?

635
01:02:58,339 --> 01:03:01,342
I paid cash. No reservation. How'd you find me?

636
01:03:01,551 --> 01:03:04,887
- Well, that's what we do, Mr. McCall. - We who?

637
01:03:05,096 --> 01:03:08,141
- We find people we need to find. - We who?

638
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:42,342
Everything about him is wrong.

639
01:04:34,894 --> 01:04:37,105
And his military history?

640
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:39,357
No.

641
01:04:39,565 --> 01:04:41,192
Keep digging.

642
01:04:41,734 --> 01:04:43,861
This is what we have on McCall so far:

643
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:47,240
College-educated. Works a straight 40 at the Home Mart.

644
01:04:47,448 --> 01:04:50,952
Bank statements, tax returns, all jive.

645
01:04:51,744 --> 01:04:53,246
Looks pretty normal.

646
01:04:53,454 --> 01:04:56,082
All lies. Fabricated.

647
01:05:06,926 --> 01:05:08,553
We need to take him cleanly.

648
01:05:08,761 --> 01:05:10,054
Alive.

649
01:05:10,263 --> 01:05:12,807
A place without cameras, no witnesses.

650
01:05:23,568 --> 01:05:27,613
A man with his skills, I want to know who he really is.

651
01:05:27,822 --> 01:05:30,241
I want to know who he's working for.

652
01:05:40,129 --> 01:05:41,506
How you doing?

653
01:05:42,381 --> 01:05:44,258
Give me a coffee, please.

654
01:05:44,467 --> 01:05:48,429
An egg sandwich too. On a roll. No cheese, please.

655
01:05:48,638 --> 01:05:50,181
You got it.

656
01:05:51,224 --> 01:05:52,934
I'll be back in a minute.

657
01:05:56,938 --> 01:05:59,857
Is it just you? Or are we waiting for someone else?

658
01:06:00,942 --> 01:06:02,235
I'm sorry. What?

659
01:06:02,985 --> 01:06:04,278
Your hands.

660
01:06:04,487 --> 01:06:07,865
If you work on power lines, your hands wouldn't look like that.

661
01:06:08,074 --> 01:06:10,284
We gotta be waiting for somebody else.

662
01:06:11,869 --> 01:06:13,162
Motherfucker.

663
01:06:21,921 --> 01:06:23,756
Hands where I can see them.

664
01:06:25,258 --> 01:06:28,845
We're gonna take a little walk across the street. Black Denali.

665
01:06:29,053 --> 01:06:30,346
Here we go.

666
01:06:35,643 --> 01:06:37,061
What the fuck?

667
01:06:37,979 --> 01:06:41,315
Vary from these instructions and I'll kill you, understand?

668
01:06:42,775 --> 01:06:44,527
All right.

669
01:06:45,736 --> 01:06:47,905
Stand up.

670
01:06:59,959 --> 01:07:02,169
What the fuck is this? Masters, let's go.

671
01:07:02,879 --> 01:07:04,297
No witnesses.

672
01:07:05,047 --> 01:07:06,465
What's going on out there?

673
01:07:21,022 --> 01:07:23,149
- What the fuck? - Let's go.

674
01:07:24,984 --> 01:07:26,986
What the hell is this guy doing?

675
01:07:43,628 --> 01:07:47,673
Remar, you got A side. Front, follow. You got C. I got B.

676
01:07:47,882 --> 01:07:49,133
Alive.

677
01:07:49,342 --> 01:07:51,218
Yeah, yeah, alive. I'm on it.

678
01:09:08,462 --> 01:09:09,755
Motherfucker.

679
01:09:13,926 --> 01:09:15,928
Motherfucker suckered me.

680
01:09:25,688 --> 01:09:27,148
Goddamn it.

681
01:11:31,188 --> 01:11:32,523
Shit.

682
01:11:46,871 --> 01:11:50,207
Pederson, check the closets, the kitchen, the back porch.

683
01:11:52,334 --> 01:11:53,627
Closet's empty.

684
01:11:56,839 --> 01:12:01,051
-Nothing on the back porch. - Fucking guy. Lives like a monk.

685
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:04,180
This guy's got a lot of books.

686
01:12:05,973 --> 01:12:09,059
Remar, stop fucking around. Check the computer.

687
01:12:23,032 --> 01:12:27,203
This place is way too clean, boss. Something doesn't feel right.

688
01:12:30,664 --> 01:12:33,667
We've got an empty script. "Meclizine."

689
01:12:35,961 --> 01:12:37,963
It's used for airsickness.

690
01:12:38,172 --> 01:12:40,382
Travel items purchased three days ago.

691
01:12:40,591 --> 01:12:43,844
Bought an open-ended plane ticket to Mexico two days ago.

692
01:12:44,887 --> 01:12:48,057
- Leaves Logan 10 a.m. tomorrow. - Guy knew this was coming.

693
01:12:48,265 --> 01:12:50,643
- He's running. - Get someone at the airport.

694
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:55,022
-He is not going anywhere. - Wait, what are you talking about?

695
01:12:57,149 --> 01:12:59,610
He's watching us.

696
01:13:04,114 --> 01:13:05,574
What do you wanna do?

697
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:18,045
Find him. Or I will bring people who can.

698
01:14:52,556 --> 01:14:55,100
If you've come for help, I can't give you any.

699
01:14:55,309 --> 01:14:57,603
- I understand. - Do you?

700
01:14:57,811 --> 01:14:59,521
Just came for tea.

701
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:07,363
Just...

702
01:15:07,571 --> 01:15:10,366
Robert, I have very little influence these days.

703
01:15:10,574 --> 01:15:12,659
I'm not at the Agency anymore.

704
01:15:12,868 --> 01:15:14,870
I consult on a few things. That's it.

705
01:15:15,079 --> 01:15:19,875
Susan, I just need to know who this man is.

706
01:15:28,092 --> 01:15:29,843
Who is he to you?

707
01:15:30,052 --> 01:15:32,221
That's why I'm here, trying to find out.

708
01:15:32,429 --> 01:15:34,556
Tell me what's going on. Please?

709
01:15:48,278 --> 01:15:51,281
You had a nice funeral, in case you were wondering.

710
01:15:52,825 --> 01:15:55,828
You know, when they told Susan you were dead...

711
01:15:56,412 --> 01:15:58,122
...she couldn't comprehend it.

712
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:00,040
She said, "Oh, no. Not Robert.

713
01:16:00,749 --> 01:16:03,961
And not from something as trivial as a car bomb."

714
01:16:04,169 --> 01:16:06,588
That you're alive...

715
01:16:06,797 --> 01:16:09,049
...is a big relief.

716
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,469
But it didn't come as a complete surprise to her.

717
01:16:13,512 --> 01:16:16,557
We used to talk about you over the years, and she said...

718
01:16:16,765 --> 01:16:19,601
...if anyone could have figured a way out...

719
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:22,771
...a way to walk away from it all for good, you know...

720
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,940
...like a real fresh start...

721
01:16:26,233 --> 01:16:27,901
...it would have been...

722
01:16:28,527 --> 01:16:29,903
...you.

723
01:17:03,187 --> 01:17:05,647
You didn't take out five pimps, Robert.

724
01:17:07,065 --> 01:17:10,861
You took out the East Coast hub of Vladimir Pushkin.

725
01:17:11,069 --> 01:17:12,321
Pushkin.

726
01:17:12,529 --> 01:17:15,532
An oligarch who jumped in bed with the Russian mafia...

727
01:17:15,741 --> 01:17:20,245
...only he funds everything: gasoline, weapons, girls, you name it.

728
01:17:20,454 --> 01:17:23,332
He's built an intricate network on both U.S. coasts...

729
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:25,834
...that are incredibly well-insulated.

730
01:17:26,043 --> 01:17:28,921
His money and political ties make him untouchable.

731
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:35,135
Your friend here is who Pushkin sends when he's got a problem.

732
01:17:35,344 --> 01:17:39,056
Teddy Rensen. Real name, Nicolai Itchenko.

733
01:17:39,264 --> 01:17:41,433
Skill set honed in Spetsnaz.

734
01:17:41,642 --> 01:17:43,227
He's formidable and smart.

735
01:17:44,603 --> 01:17:46,813
Ran a wing of the secret police for years.

736
01:17:47,022 --> 01:17:48,815
Went private when the Union fell.

737
01:17:49,024 --> 01:17:52,152
Basically, he's a sociopath with a business card.

738
01:17:55,864 --> 01:17:58,659
Thank you, darling. You know these two?

739
01:18:00,285 --> 01:18:04,248
Boston P.D. Probably on Pushkin's payroll, I assume.

740
01:18:04,456 --> 01:18:07,626
Three years. Detective Remar and Detective Pederson.

741
01:18:07,834 --> 01:18:09,253
Only now they're dead.

742
01:18:09,461 --> 01:18:13,882
They found them yesterday in the trunk of their car in the precinct parking lot.

743
01:18:14,091 --> 01:18:17,928
Suffocated. Testicles blown off and shoved down their throats.

744
01:18:18,136 --> 01:18:20,639
Classic Russian mob hit. Teddy's work.

745
01:18:21,431 --> 01:18:25,894
Third one, Detective Masters hasn't shown up for work in several days.

746
01:18:26,103 --> 01:18:29,314
Robert, I don't have to tell you what happens next.

747
01:18:30,607 --> 01:18:34,194
He won't stop until he kills you and anyone you care about.

748
01:18:56,383 --> 01:18:58,010
Didn't sleep a wink, did you?

749
01:18:59,678 --> 01:19:00,971
Hey.

750
01:19:09,896 --> 01:19:12,441
Robert, that girl, Alina.

751
01:19:13,609 --> 01:19:14,985
Why?

752
01:19:18,405 --> 01:19:20,741
I couldn't tell you why it mattered.

753
01:19:20,949 --> 01:19:24,161
Why what they did to her, that mattered to me so much.

754
01:19:26,204 --> 01:19:30,250
One day somebody does something unspeakable to someone else to...

755
01:19:31,209 --> 01:19:34,254
...someone you hardly knew, and you...

756
01:19:35,756 --> 01:19:38,216
...do something about it because you can.

757
01:19:39,092 --> 01:19:40,969
Because it's who you are?

758
01:19:41,762 --> 01:19:43,472
Who you've always been?

759
01:19:47,351 --> 01:19:52,105
Sometimes we make the wrong choices to get to the right place.

760
01:19:57,069 --> 01:20:00,447
I know a part of you died when Vivian did.

761
01:20:01,531 --> 01:20:04,159
But not the part she loved the most.

762
01:20:07,079 --> 01:20:08,747
Go be him.

763
01:20:16,296 --> 01:20:17,631
Yep.

764
01:20:19,591 --> 01:20:21,551
Don't forget to say goodbye.

765
01:20:27,099 --> 01:20:28,517
Goodbye.

766
01:20:35,107 --> 01:20:37,025
Everything all right?

767
01:20:38,276 --> 01:20:40,028
Were you able to help him?

768
01:20:40,862 --> 01:20:42,656
He didn't come for help.

769
01:20:43,115 --> 01:20:44,950
He came for permission.

770
01:22:05,739 --> 01:22:07,199
Fuck.

771
01:22:19,836 --> 01:22:21,505
What the fuck?

772
01:23:13,682 --> 01:23:16,017
Testing one, two, three, four.

773
01:23:20,188 --> 01:23:21,565
Pushkin.

774
01:23:21,773 --> 01:23:26,903
I need to know everything: who, what, when, where, why.

775
01:23:27,112 --> 01:23:29,573
Before you tell me you're not gonna talk...

776
01:23:32,826 --> 01:23:35,078
You can go fuck yourself, you know that?

777
01:23:52,262 --> 01:23:54,264
You're gonna give me what I need.

778
01:23:55,974 --> 01:23:58,894
- Or not. - You're such a fuck.

779
01:23:59,102 --> 01:24:02,814
Why don't you get out of here and go fuck yourself, you motherfucker?

780
01:24:03,023 --> 01:24:05,108
You know who you're dealing with, huh?

781
01:24:05,317 --> 01:24:07,485
I am a cop, you moron!

782
01:24:07,944 --> 01:24:10,113
I swear to God, I'll fuck--

783
01:24:13,158 --> 01:24:15,118
Okay. Open it.

784
01:24:16,536 --> 01:24:18,580
Open the fucking wind--

785
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:24,711
- I'm Boston P.D. - I don't have a lot of time.

786
01:24:26,421 --> 01:24:28,381
Which means you don't have any.

787
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:31,593
Look, you are in a lot of trouble.

788
01:24:31,801 --> 01:24:34,304
Just let me go. Just let me go.

789
01:24:34,512 --> 01:24:36,306
I'm gonna let you go.

790
01:24:38,350 --> 01:24:40,101
I'm gonna let you go.

791
01:24:44,606 --> 01:24:46,483
- I'll be back. - No!

792
01:24:48,902 --> 01:24:51,488
Motherfucker! Wait.

793
01:24:51,696 --> 01:24:53,073
Wait!

794
01:24:53,281 --> 01:24:55,075
Wait!

795
01:24:57,452 --> 01:24:59,204
We're here to see Andri.

796
01:26:14,738 --> 01:26:17,615
Hey, Andri. Listen, this location's been compromised.

797
01:26:17,824 --> 01:26:21,119
Get all your shit out of here. You gotta truck it all out.

798
01:26:23,955 --> 01:26:28,668
The fuck I'm going to do that. And who's this fucking piece of shit?

799
01:26:28,877 --> 01:26:31,254
Pushkin made the call. I'm just the new guy.

800
01:26:32,589 --> 01:26:34,883
- Pushkin. - Pushkin. I--

801
01:26:35,091 --> 01:26:38,595
Pushkin's money. What the fuck you give a fuck, Andri, huh?

802
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:52,233
Is that a Heckler Koch?

803
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:55,236
- This? - Yeah.

804
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:00,909
- What is he saying? - I don't fucking...

805
01:27:01,659 --> 01:27:05,121
- Can I see it? - Oh, you want to see my gun?

806
01:27:06,664 --> 01:27:08,249
Yes and no.

807
01:27:08,958 --> 01:27:11,002
- No. - Oh, fuck!

808
01:27:11,211 --> 01:27:13,088
All right, all right, all right!

809
01:27:14,547 --> 01:27:17,092
You're so fucking nuts! Fuck!

810
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:19,427
All right. Everybody settle down.

811
01:27:20,136 --> 01:27:22,972
Frank tells me you're the man, Andri. Yeah?

812
01:27:23,181 --> 01:27:25,850
He says your guys are incredibly loyal toward you.

813
01:27:26,059 --> 01:27:29,562
If you tell them to put their guns down, lay down on the floor...

814
01:27:29,771 --> 01:27:31,481
...they'll do that, won't they?

815
01:27:36,611 --> 01:27:40,073
Indulge me, Andri. Tell them to lay down.

816
01:27:43,493 --> 01:27:45,411
There you go. Thank you very much.

817
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:48,414
There you go. Mr. Pushkin thanks you very much.

818
01:27:48,623 --> 01:27:51,167
We're going out of business. Closing down shop.

819
01:27:51,376 --> 01:27:53,920
Mr. Pushkin thanks you very much. There you are.

820
01:27:54,129 --> 01:27:55,630
Here you go. You're welcome.

821
01:27:55,839 --> 01:27:59,467
Accept these parting gifts on behalf of Mr. Pushkin. There you go.

822
01:27:59,676 --> 01:28:01,928
Three, two-- Look at that, perfect. --one.

823
01:28:02,137 --> 01:28:05,849
Thank you. Thank you, sweetheart. Right around to the right.

824
01:28:09,435 --> 01:28:10,770
Call it in.

825
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:21,322
- Boston P.D. - Detective Frank Masters.

826
01:28:21,531 --> 01:28:25,535
I am 10-13 at 155 Warren Street, rear entrance.

827
01:28:25,743 --> 01:28:30,456
Repeat: Detective Frank Masters, 10-13, 155 Warren Street, rear entrance.

828
01:28:35,962 --> 01:28:38,965
- Anything else I can do for you? - You tell me, Frank.

829
01:28:39,883 --> 01:28:42,760
I know you got an escape plan. Where do you keep it?

830
01:28:43,428 --> 01:28:45,388
Yeah? What's your escape plan, huh?

831
01:28:45,597 --> 01:28:48,516
Not about me. It's about you. Where do you keep it?

832
01:28:48,725 --> 01:28:52,270
Fuck you, you motherfucker. You have fucked me so fucking bad!

833
01:28:52,478 --> 01:28:54,731
- You did this! - Do you hear yourself?

834
01:28:54,939 --> 01:28:56,900
You did it to this badge, Frank.

835
01:28:57,108 --> 01:29:00,486
You disrespected this badge. You understand me?

836
01:29:00,695 --> 01:29:04,991
Fuck you, you motherfucker. I got nothing, all right? You hear me?

837
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,826
I got nothing because of you!

838
01:29:07,035 --> 01:29:10,413
You think they're not coming for you, you're not fucking next?

839
01:29:10,622 --> 01:29:12,999
- I am a dead man! - Do something about it.

840
01:29:13,208 --> 01:29:15,293
You don't know who these people are!

841
01:29:15,501 --> 01:29:18,880
I'm a fucking dead man. I won't last a fucking week.

842
01:29:19,088 --> 01:29:20,840
Then do the right thing.

843
01:29:21,883 --> 01:29:23,593
Motherfu--

844
01:29:27,555 --> 01:29:29,265
Do the right thing, Frank.

845
01:29:29,474 --> 01:29:33,978
Police officer for 22 years, I know you didn't get this far and not have an out.

846
01:29:34,187 --> 01:29:37,815
- Where do you keep it? - I was a fucking good cop.

847
01:29:41,444 --> 01:29:42,862
I was.

848
01:29:43,529 --> 01:29:45,073
I understand.

849
01:29:45,698 --> 01:29:47,158
Do the right thing.

850
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:50,578
Do it for the good cops, Frank.

851
01:29:50,787 --> 01:29:52,622
Where do you keep it?

852
01:29:58,962 --> 01:30:01,589
Just let me know when you're done, detective.

853
01:30:27,115 --> 01:30:28,533
This guy here.

854
01:30:30,618 --> 01:30:34,706
He was cuffed to the pipes back here, 200,000 in the trunk of his car.

855
01:30:34,914 --> 01:30:37,959
Recording of the whole deal with these guys on the seat.

856
01:30:38,167 --> 01:30:40,420
Crazy. And that was tacked to his jacket.

857
01:30:42,463 --> 01:30:43,965
That's not the best part.

858
01:30:44,173 --> 01:30:45,967
We're on scene for the duration.

859
01:30:46,175 --> 01:30:49,053
- Get IDs on all those guys. - Check this out.

860
01:31:00,982 --> 01:31:02,859
Holy shit!

861
01:31:03,067 --> 01:31:05,486
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

862
01:31:05,695 --> 01:31:07,905
Who's gonna fucking count this?

863
01:31:10,616 --> 01:31:12,618
We've searched the city.

864
01:31:12,827 --> 01:31:14,245
No sign of him.

865
01:31:14,454 --> 01:31:16,956
McCall has disappeared.

866
01:31:17,165 --> 01:31:19,417
Mr. Pushkin has been notified.

867
01:31:24,964 --> 01:31:27,008
My men will find him

868
01:31:27,925 --> 01:31:29,302
Good.

869
01:31:30,803 --> 01:31:32,513
I got to piss.

870
01:32:00,842 --> 01:32:02,552
He's not coming back.

871
01:32:08,934 --> 01:32:10,018
Had enough?

872
01:32:10,644 --> 01:32:13,897
- You certainly have my attention. - Because I can keep going.

873
01:32:14,105 --> 01:32:16,441
Brick by brick. Dollar by dollar.

874
01:32:16,650 --> 01:32:19,277
Body by body.

875
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:24,574
Or you can call your boss and tell him to shut down his operation.

876
01:32:24,783 --> 01:32:26,034
Tonight.

877
01:32:26,242 --> 01:32:29,329
- That's not much of an offer. - Only one you're gonna get.

878
01:32:30,038 --> 01:32:33,541
When you pray for rain, you gotta deal with the mud too.

879
01:32:38,171 --> 01:32:39,923
When you look at me...

880
01:32:40,674 --> 01:32:41,967
...what do you see?

881
01:32:47,347 --> 01:32:49,557
The answer's nothing.

882
01:32:49,766 --> 01:32:53,895
I have no feelings about you one way or the other. You're like...

883
01:32:54,521 --> 01:32:57,357
Like lint or a bottle cap.

884
01:32:57,565 --> 01:32:59,776
You're just a thing to remove.

885
01:33:02,445 --> 01:33:05,281
I knew a Russian police captain back in the day.

886
01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:09,160
He told me about a case he worked on. Can't remember the guy's name.

887
01:33:09,369 --> 01:33:12,080
He was a famous scholar, lived in Moscow.

888
01:33:12,288 --> 01:33:14,082
He was a humanitarian, an author.

889
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:18,712
Anyway, he decided to share his abundance with someone less fortunate.

890
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:23,008
And even though he had five children, he opened his home to a sixth.

891
01:33:23,216 --> 01:33:25,427
An orphan, 12-year-old boy.

892
01:33:26,302 --> 01:33:29,556
Kid had been pounded by the system from an early age.

893
01:33:29,764 --> 01:33:31,307
Troubled.

894
01:33:31,516 --> 01:33:34,019
Prone to violence. A lost cause.

895
01:33:34,227 --> 01:33:36,980
- Stop me if you know this one. - Oh, no. Carry on.

896
01:33:37,188 --> 01:33:41,568
Okay. So this good man opened his home to this boy.

897
01:33:41,776 --> 01:33:45,697
And when the boy stole from him, this good man loved him anyway.

898
01:33:45,905 --> 01:33:49,909
When the boy failed in school, this man showed understanding and patience.

899
01:33:50,118 --> 01:33:54,497
When the boy lied and cheated and clawed and fought...

900
01:33:54,706 --> 01:33:59,669
...this good man showed compassion and love...

901
01:33:59,878 --> 01:34:04,174
...until the boy, who had never felt anything like being wanted or loved...

902
01:34:04,382 --> 01:34:05,925
...he finally did.

903
01:34:06,134 --> 01:34:09,262
The man had broken through. It was a miracle.

904
01:34:09,471 --> 01:34:12,724
One week later, intruders broke into the man's house.

905
01:34:12,932 --> 01:34:16,603
Killed the man and his wife in bed.

906
01:34:16,811 --> 01:34:19,230
They said some small things were stolen...

907
01:34:19,439 --> 01:34:21,441
...things a child might steal.

908
01:34:21,649 --> 01:34:23,109
No one knows for sure.

909
01:34:23,318 --> 01:34:25,945
The man's children were sent off to relatives.

910
01:34:26,154 --> 01:34:28,990
The boy, the orphan, shipped back to hell.

911
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:34,370
Just when he finally had a chance at life, it was snatched away by two bullets.

912
01:34:34,913 --> 01:34:38,374
- It's a well-known story. - They ever catch who did it?

913
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:40,627
Did they?

914
01:34:40,835 --> 01:34:43,046
Maybe they didn't look in the right place.

915
01:34:43,254 --> 01:34:45,590
Sometimes the answer's in front of you.

916
01:34:45,799 --> 01:34:50,053
I think the boy killed them.

917
01:34:50,345 --> 01:34:51,805
I think the boy did it.

918
01:34:52,013 --> 01:34:55,433
The boy was scared his foster parents would wake up one day...

919
01:34:55,642 --> 01:34:58,895
...and realise he wasn't worth it, like all the others had.

920
01:34:59,104 --> 01:35:03,900
And he couldn't bear the thought that this good man would do that to him.

921
01:35:04,109 --> 01:35:05,777
Would throw him away...

922
01:35:06,444 --> 01:35:10,198
...like a piece of lint or a bottle cap.

923
01:35:10,990 --> 01:35:12,492
So...

924
01:35:12,992 --> 01:35:15,328
...he decided not to find out.

925
01:35:17,789 --> 01:35:19,666
What do you think, Nicolai?

926
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:26,297
You think you know me?

927
01:35:28,174 --> 01:35:30,885
You strike me as a sentimental man, Mr. McCall.

928
01:35:31,094 --> 01:35:32,971
That's surprising.

929
01:35:33,179 --> 01:35:34,514
I...

930
01:35:34,722 --> 01:35:36,182
I don't possess that chip.

931
01:35:36,391 --> 01:35:40,228
I never could understand what comes from feeling that way...

932
01:35:40,436 --> 01:35:42,814
...except weakness.

933
01:35:45,316 --> 01:35:47,735
The men I killed, your men...

934
01:35:47,944 --> 01:35:49,863
...I gave them a chance.

935
01:35:50,655 --> 01:35:52,866
They made their decision.

936
01:35:53,783 --> 01:35:56,536
I'm giving you the opportunity to make yours.

937
01:35:57,328 --> 01:35:59,414
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

938
01:35:59,956 --> 01:36:01,541
You let me know...

939
01:36:02,625 --> 01:36:04,252
...when you decide.

940
01:36:04,752 --> 01:36:06,045
Of course.

941
01:36:09,382 --> 01:36:12,302
I've done some bad things in my life, Nicolai.

942
01:36:13,469 --> 01:36:15,305
Things I'm not proud of.

943
01:36:18,141 --> 01:36:20,518
I promised someone that I love very much...

944
01:36:20,727 --> 01:36:23,521
...that I would never go back to being that person.

945
01:36:26,024 --> 01:36:27,442
But for you...

946
01:36:28,943 --> 01:36:30,778
...I'm gonna make an exception.

947
01:36:35,074 --> 01:36:37,827
You asked me what I saw when I looked at you.

948
01:36:42,665 --> 01:36:44,834
What do you see when you look at me?

949
01:37:50,566 --> 01:37:53,987
- FBI. How can I direct your call? - Agent Mosley, please.

950
01:37:58,324 --> 01:38:01,786
- Agent Mosley. - Heard you found some money today.

951
01:38:01,995 --> 01:38:03,496
Who is this?

952
01:38:03,705 --> 01:38:07,375
Concerned citizen. Check your personal e-mail.

953
01:38:09,168 --> 01:38:11,754
Make sure you're sitting down when you do.

954
01:39:44,597 --> 01:39:47,642
He hit my tankers. And you tell me not to worry?

955
01:39:47,850 --> 01:39:52,146
That you'll take care of things? Only I've been further embarrassed.

956
01:39:52,355 --> 01:39:54,982
I have a new team. It's simply a matter of time.

957
01:39:55,191 --> 01:39:56,818
You're out of time.

958
01:39:57,026 --> 01:39:59,404
New York had to shut down. Nothing is moving.

959
01:39:59,612 --> 01:40:04,534
My calls aren't being answered. I've lost tens of millions today alone.

960
01:40:04,742 --> 01:40:06,536
It will all be well.

961
01:40:06,744 --> 01:40:09,330
Stop the bleeding, or don't come back.

962
01:40:11,541 --> 01:40:13,459
Go fuck yourself.

963
01:40:38,401 --> 01:40:40,903
- Yes? - Mr. McCall.

964
01:40:41,863 --> 01:40:44,866
- Nicolai. - Your life for theirs.

965
01:40:45,074 --> 01:40:48,077
- Whose? - You'll want to answer that.

966
01:40:51,747 --> 01:40:54,667
- Yes? Ralphie? - Mr. McCall?

967
01:40:54,876 --> 01:40:57,503
They came into the store when we were closing.

968
01:40:57,712 --> 01:41:00,756
- Who's with you? - Jenny, Brian, Jay and Marcus.

969
01:41:00,965 --> 01:41:02,758
What's going on? Wait--

970
01:41:02,967 --> 01:41:04,469
Oh, my God.

971
01:41:05,887 --> 01:41:07,180
No.

972
01:41:09,223 --> 01:41:11,476
My men there will kill them in 30 minutes.

973
01:41:12,185 --> 01:41:13,895
Unless you're here in 29.

974
01:41:14,103 --> 01:41:15,438
You know the place.

975
01:41:15,646 --> 01:41:18,274
You can still smell the burning gasoline.

976
01:41:40,254 --> 01:41:42,006
He's close. Get ready.

977
01:41:54,143 --> 01:41:55,520
Here comes the bus.

978
01:41:59,524 --> 01:42:01,651
Just checking on you, sentimental man.

979
01:42:01,859 --> 01:42:04,445
- Yeah? - You willing to die for your friends?

980
01:42:04,654 --> 01:42:05,988
Are you?

981
01:42:10,409 --> 01:42:12,703
When you see him, shoot him.

982
01:42:16,123 --> 01:42:18,209
The bus is empty.

983
01:42:26,425 --> 01:42:27,927
Kill one.

984
01:42:29,428 --> 01:42:30,846
Kill one of them.

985
01:42:31,305 --> 01:42:32,640
You wanna be first?

986
01:42:40,106 --> 01:42:42,608
- Where is that coming from? - I don't know.

987
01:42:42,817 --> 01:42:44,694
I don't know!

988
01:42:47,154 --> 01:42:49,115
They're gonna kill Ralphie, yo.

989
01:42:49,323 --> 01:42:51,200
They're gonna fucking kill him.

990
01:42:58,207 --> 01:43:00,793
- Which way? - What?

991
01:43:04,005 --> 01:43:06,340
The song. Which way is it coming from?

992
01:43:06,549 --> 01:43:08,968
The P.A. system's in the security office.

993
01:43:09,176 --> 01:43:11,470
Stand! Now.

994
01:43:59,727 --> 01:44:03,189
Mr. McCall? What's going on? Who are these people?

995
01:44:07,693 --> 01:44:09,153
Come here quickly!

996
01:44:11,447 --> 01:44:12,948
I need your help.

997
01:44:44,063 --> 01:44:45,981
Report! Where are you?

998
01:44:54,073 --> 01:44:55,866
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

999
01:44:56,075 --> 01:44:57,952
I... I can't understand you.

1000
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:00,496
- Okay, I'm going down. - Get down!

1001
01:45:07,044 --> 01:45:08,421
Ralphie.

1002
01:45:08,838 --> 01:45:11,716
Get everybody out of here. Don't leave anybody behind.

1003
01:45:11,924 --> 01:45:14,510
You use the service doors in the back. Okay? Go.

1004
01:45:27,532 --> 01:45:30,994
- Yeah? - Very clever, Mr. McCall.

1005
01:45:31,953 --> 01:45:34,080
I've decided to come and see you.

1006
01:45:34,289 --> 01:45:35,582
Yeah?

1007
01:45:36,291 --> 01:45:37,793
I'll be waiting for you.

1008
01:45:54,851 --> 01:45:56,645
Find the hostages.

1009
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:33,601
It's me, Mr. McCall. It's Ralphie.

1010
01:53:35,770 --> 01:53:37,855
You said not to leave anybody behind.

1011
01:53:40,066 --> 01:53:41,359
Buck-ninety, my ass.

1012
01:54:05,091 --> 01:54:06,384
Come on.

1013
01:54:07,510 --> 01:54:08,928
Oh, fuck!

1014
01:54:22,358 --> 01:54:23,651
You all right?

1015
01:54:24,402 --> 01:54:25,987
I've been shot.

1016
01:54:26,404 --> 01:54:28,448
- Can you walk? - Yeah.

1017
01:54:29,282 --> 01:54:31,826
I'm gonna need you to do something. Look at me.

1018
01:54:32,035 --> 01:54:34,037
- Ralphie, focus. Focus. - Okay.

1019
01:54:34,871 --> 01:54:36,789
Can you make it to the breaker box?

1020
01:54:45,089 --> 01:54:47,300
Forty seconds, exactly.

1021
01:54:47,508 --> 01:54:48,801
Forty seconds exactly.

1022
01:56:59,307 --> 01:57:00,641
Shit.

1023
01:57:08,274 --> 01:57:09,567
Shit.

1024
01:58:19,762 --> 01:58:21,847
Who are you?

1025
01:59:41,177 --> 01:59:44,138
Shit. Oh, shit.

1026
02:01:03,968 --> 02:01:06,303
I'd stay in there if I were you.

1027
02:01:12,810 --> 02:01:14,395
Who are you?

1028
02:01:16,605 --> 02:01:18,190
Everybody wants to know.

1029
02:01:21,819 --> 02:01:24,321
Gun's not there. Just put the towel on.

1030
02:01:25,781 --> 02:01:27,074
What do you want?

1031
02:01:29,076 --> 02:01:30,995
I want the head of the snake.

1032
02:01:33,831 --> 02:01:35,332
So it's you.

1033
02:01:37,501 --> 02:01:39,462
And now you've come to kill me.

1034
02:01:40,045 --> 02:01:41,422
Yes.

1035
02:01:44,425 --> 02:01:48,763
And tell me, what do you gain from my death?

1036
02:01:53,100 --> 02:01:54,393
Peace.

1037
02:01:57,772 --> 02:02:00,524
Peace is expensive to buy.

1038
02:02:01,358 --> 02:02:03,944
But I can purchase it for you.

1039
02:02:04,153 --> 02:02:06,363
What is your price?

1040
02:02:07,490 --> 02:02:08,866
Are you there?

1041
02:02:30,638 --> 02:02:33,015
Guards, guards!

1042
02:03:44,086 --> 02:03:45,379
Hey!

1043
02:03:47,172 --> 02:03:49,258
Hey! Hey, Robert.

1044
02:03:51,510 --> 02:03:53,762
Hey, I remembered you lived around here...

1045
02:03:53,971 --> 02:03:56,557
...so I've been swinging by the last few days.

1046
02:03:56,765 --> 02:03:58,350
Yeah?

1047
02:03:58,559 --> 02:04:01,020
Yeah. Pretty different, huh?

1048
02:04:01,228 --> 02:04:02,688
Night and day.

1049
02:04:04,148 --> 02:04:05,566
Yeah, well...

1050
02:04:07,776 --> 02:04:10,779
I get my stitches out next week.

1051
02:04:14,325 --> 02:04:16,952
- I'm reading now. - Oh, no!

1052
02:04:17,161 --> 02:04:18,746
- Yeah! I know. - Very good.

1053
02:04:18,954 --> 02:04:23,417
I got it from a used book store. The guy there recommended it to me. It's good.

1054
02:04:24,835 --> 02:04:26,545
I got a job too.

1055
02:04:27,129 --> 02:04:30,507
- A real job with real hours and stuff. - Okay.

1056
02:04:33,469 --> 02:04:36,472
When they gave me my stuff back at the hospital...

1057
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:40,434
...there was this envelope with my name on it.

1058
02:04:42,144 --> 02:04:44,188
Almost $10,000 inside...

1059
02:04:44,396 --> 02:04:46,482
...and a ticket out of town.

1060
02:04:48,233 --> 02:04:49,860
Probably hush money, right?

1061
02:04:50,569 --> 02:04:51,862
Probably.

1062
02:04:54,114 --> 02:04:55,532
Who cares?

1063
02:04:56,617 --> 02:04:58,035
A new start.

1064
02:04:58,702 --> 02:05:00,079
Alina the singer.

1065
02:05:00,955 --> 02:05:04,083
Someone once told me I could be whoever I wanted to be.

1066
02:05:04,959 --> 02:05:06,961
Body, mind...

1067
02:05:07,169 --> 02:05:08,504
Spirit.

1068
02:05:10,047 --> 02:05:13,759
- I'm gonna miss your stories, Robert. - You got your own now.

1069
02:05:17,179 --> 02:05:18,555
Thank you.

1070
02:05:21,684 --> 02:05:22,977
For everything.

1071
02:05:31,568 --> 02:05:32,861
I'll catch you around.

1072
02:05:34,113 --> 02:05:35,197
Okay.

1073
02:05:37,366 --> 02:05:39,827
- Bye, Robert. - Goodbye, Alina.
