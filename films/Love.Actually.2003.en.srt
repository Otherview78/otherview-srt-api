1
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:16,993
<i>Whenever I get gloomy
with the state of the world,</i>

2
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:20,538
<i>I think about the arrivals
gate at Heathrow airport.</i>

3
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,081
<i>General opinion
started to make out</i>

4
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,584
<i>that we live in a world
of hatred and greed,</i>

5
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,169
<i>but I don't see that.</i>

6
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,671
<i>Seems to me that
love is everywhere.</i>

7
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,925
<i>Often it's not particularly
dignified or newsworthy,</i>

8
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,760
<i>but it's always there.</i>

9
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,428
<i>Fathers and sons,
mothers and daughters,</i>

10
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:36,721
<i>husbands and wives,</i>

11
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:39,557
<i>boyfriends, girlfriends,
old friends.</i>

12
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,060
<i>When the planes
hit the Twin Towers,</i>

13
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,604
<i>as far as I know, none of the
phone calls from the people on board</i>

14
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,315
<i>were messages of
hate or revenge.</i>

15
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,609
<i>They were all
messages of love.</i>

16
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,237
<i>If you look for it,
I've got a sneaky feeling</i>

17
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,907
<i>you'll find that love
actually is all around.</i>

18
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,550
<i>I feel it in my fingers</i>

19
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,887
<i>I feel it in my toes</i>

20
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:22,725
<i>Feel it in my toes, yeah</i>

21
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:27,230
<i>Love is all around me
And so the...</i>

22
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,607
<i>I'm afraid you
did it again, Bill.</i>

23
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:34,195
It's just, I know the old
version so well, you know.

24
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,739
<i>Well, we all do.</i>

25
00:02:36,864 --> 00:02:39,367
<i>That's why we're
making the new version.</i>

26
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,994
Right, okay, let's go.

27
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,749
<i>I feel it in my fingers</i>

28
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,875
<i>In my fingers</i>

29
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,962
<i>I feel it in my toes</i>

30
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:55,466
<i>Feel it in my toes, yeah</i>

31
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,635
<i>Love is all...</i>

32
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,431
Fuck, wank, bugger,
shitting ass head and hole.

33
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,310
Start again.

34
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,651
<i>I feel it in my fingers</i>

35
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:14,777
<i>In my fingers</i>

36
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,780
<i>I feel it in my toes</i>

37
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:22,535
<i>Feel it in my toes, yeah</i>

38
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:24,787
<i>Christmas is all around me</i>

39
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:25,913
<i>All around me</i>

40
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:29,167
<i>And so the feeling grows</i>

41
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,546
<i>So the feeling grows</i>

42
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:36,215
<i>It's written in the wind</i>

43
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,550
<i>In the wind</i>

44
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:40,136
<i>It's everywhere I go</i>

45
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:44,974
<i>Everywhere I go</i>

46
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,477
<i>So if you
really love Christmas</i>

47
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,603
<i>Love Christmas</i>

48
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,147
<i>Come on and let it snow</i>

49
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,399
<i>Come on and let it...</i>

50
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,651
This is shit, isn't it?

51
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:58,529
<i>Yep,
solid gold shit, maestro.</i>

52
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,389
God, I'm so late.

53
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,808
It's just round the corner.
You'll make it.

54
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,685
You sure you don't mind
me going without you?

55
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,146
No, really.
I'm just feeling so rotten.

56
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:33,648
I love you.

57
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,899
I know.

58
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:38,820
I love you even when you're
sick and look disgusting.

59
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,698
I know. Now, go or
you will actually miss it.

60
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,534
Right.

61
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,913
Did I mention that I love you?

62
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:51,833
Yes, you did.
Get out, loser.

63
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,853
Karen, it's me again.

64
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:16,107
I'm sorry, I literally
don't have anyone else to talk to.

65
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,778
Absolutely. Horrible moment right
now, though. Can I call you back?

66
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,196
Of course.

67
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,033
Doesn't mean I'm not terribly
concerned that your wife just died.

68
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,286
Understood.

69
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,705
Bugger off, call me later.

70
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,461
So what's this
big news then?

71
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,962
We've been given our
parts in the nativity play...

72
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,007
...and I'm the lobster.

73
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,675
The lobster?
Yeah.

74
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,343
In the nativity play?

75
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,179
Yeah. First lobster.

76
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:50,016
There was more than one lobster
present at the birth of Jesus?

77
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,100
Duh.

78
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,900
Best sandwiches in Britain.

79
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,403
Try my lovely nuts?

80
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,200
Beautiful muffin
for a beautiful lady.

81
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,955
Morning, my future wife.

82
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,309
Okay, you can
stop there. Thanks.

83
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,270
I'm gonna need a couple
of orange gels, please, mate.

84
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,064
And by the way, he
introduced me as John,

85
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,524
but actually
everyone calls me Jack.

86
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,527
Fine. Nice to meet you, Jack.

87
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,196
He got me right, though.
I'm just Judy.

88
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,031
Great, Just Judy!

89
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,956
No surprises?
No surprises.

90
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,958
Not like the stag night?

91
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,834
Unlike the stag night.

92
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,920
Do you admit the Brazilian
prostitutes were a mistake?

93
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,421
I do.

94
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:06,050
And it would've been much better
if they'd not turned out to be men?

95
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:08,135
That is true.

96
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,682
Good luck, kiddo.

97
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,499
Prime Minister!

98
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,846
Thank you.

99
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,890
Welcome, Prime Minister.

100
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,643
I must work
on my wave.

101
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,186
How are you?

102
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,273
How are you feeling?

103
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,483
Cool. Powerful.

104
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,278
Would you like to meet
your household staff?

105
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,947
Yes, I would like
that very much indeed.

106
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,034
Anything to put off
actually running the country.

107
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,871
This is Terence. He's in charge.

108
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,581
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.

109
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,541
I had an uncle
called Terence once.

110
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,084
Hated him.
I think he was a pervert.

111
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,712
But I very much
like the look of you.

112
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,048
This is Pat.
Hello, Pat.

113
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,675
Good morning, sir.
I'm the housekeeper.

114
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,219
Right. It should be a lot easier
with me than with the last lot.

115
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,181
No nappies, no teenagers,
no scary wife.

116
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,184
And this is Natalie.
She's new, like you.

117
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,269
Hello, Natalie.
Hello, David.

118
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,021
I mean, sir.

119
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,231
Shit, I can't believe
I've just said that.

120
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:48,110
And now I've gone and said
"shit." Twice. I'm so sorry, sir.

121
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,404
It's fine, it's fine.
You could've said "fuck"

122
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,823
and then we'd have been in
real trouble. Thank you, sir.

123
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:56,494
I did have an awful premonition I
was gonna fuck up on my first day.

124
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,579
Oh, piss it!

125
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:04,669
Right, I'll go get my things and
then let's fix the country, shall we?

126
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,129
Yeah,
I can't see why not.

127
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,645
It's all right.
Did you see what I did?

128
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,355
Yes, I did.
I just went...

129
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,023
Hello, there.

130
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,108
I'm right over here.

131
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,152
Yeah, I'm in here.
Okay. Good. Thank you.

132
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:41,330
Oh, no.
That is so inconvenient.

133
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,254
In the presence of God, Peter
and Juliet have given their consent

134
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,881
and made their marriage
vows to each other.

135
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:54,260
They've declared their marriage
by the giving and receiving of rings.

136
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:58,264
I therefore proclaim that
they are husband and wife.

137
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:06,939
And you resisted the
temptation for surprises.

138
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:09,108
Yeah, I'm mature now.

139
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:22,288
<i>Love, love, love</i>

140
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:27,001
<i>Love, love, love</i>

141
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,463
Did you do this?

142
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,340
No.

143
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:38,137
<i>Love, love, love, love</i>

144
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,309
<i>There's nothing you can do
that can't be done</i>

145
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,477
It...

146
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,605
<i>There's nothing you can sing
that can't be sung</i>

147
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:53,152
<i>There's nothing you can say but
you can learn how to play the game</i>

148
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,614
<i>It's easy</i>

149
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,326
<i>All you need is love</i>

150
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,498
<i>All you need is love</i>

151
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,796
<i>All you need is love, love</i>

152
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,007
<i>Love is all you need...</i>

153
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,804
Look, it's Pikey.

154
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,567
Hello! What the hell
are you doing here?

155
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,779
I just popped over
to borrow some old CDs.

156
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,280
The lady of the house
let you in, did she?

157
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,573
Yeah.

158
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,659
Lovely, obliging girl.

159
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,868
Yeah.

160
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,328
All right,
I just thought I'd pop back

161
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:45,996
before the reception
and see if she's better.

162
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,334
This is good.
Listen, I've been thinking.

163
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,795
I think perhaps
we ought to take

164
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,214
Mum out for her birthday
on Friday. What do you think?

165
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,216
I just feel we've been
bad sons this year.

166
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,135
Okay, sounds fine.
A bit boring but fine.

167
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,679
Hurry up, big boy!

168
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:05,516
I'm naked, and I want you at
least twice before Jamie gets home.

169
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,863
I am so
happy to see you!

170
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,657
A delicious delicacy?

171
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,117
No, thanks.

172
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,000
Taste explosion?

173
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:45,306
Food?
No, thanks.

174
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,143
Yeah, a bit dodgy, isn't it?
Looks like a dead baby's finger.

175
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,480
Tastes like it, too.

176
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,278
I'm Colin, by the way.

177
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,822
I'm Nancy.
Wicked.

178
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,366
What do you do, Nancy?
I'm a cook.

179
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,285
Ever do weddings?
Yes, I do.

180
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,245
They should've asked
you to do this one.

181
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,580
They did.

182
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,917
God, I wish you hadn't
have turned it down.

183
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,126
I didn't.

184
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:16,378
Right.

185
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,091
I've just worked out why
I can never find true love.

186
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,217
Why is that?

187
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,637
English girls. They're
stuck up, you see.

188
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,889
And I am primarily
attractive to girls

189
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,350
who are, you know,
cooler, game for a laugh.

190
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:33,687
Like American girls. So I
should just go to America.

191
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,190
I would get a girlfriend
there instantly.

192
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,274
What do you think?

193
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,318
I think it's crap, Colin.

194
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,278
That's where you're wrong.

195
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,490
American girls would seriously
dig me with my cute British accent.

196
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,116
You don't have a cute
British accent.

197
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,369
Yes, I do!
I'm going to America.

198
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:52,247
Colin, you're a lonely, ugly
asshole, and you must accept it.

199
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,292
Never. I am Colin, God of Sex.

200
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,378
I'm just on the wrong
continent, that's all.

201
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,506
Bit of quiet while we
finish the lighting, guys!

202
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,175
I thought I was never
gonna make it here today.

203
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:04,969
The traffic was just...
Unbelievable.

204
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,262
Judy, could you take
the top off this time?

205
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,223
Lighting and camera need to
know when we're actually gonna

206
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,642
see the nipples
and when we're not.

207
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:15,479
Yes, okay. Right. At least
it's nice and warm in here.

208
00:14:15,562 --> 00:14:17,523
Yeah. It's not
always the case, is it?

209
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,359
I was standing in for Brad Pitt
once on <i>Seven Years in Tibet...</i>

210
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,945
Yes, yeah.
Bloody freezing.

211
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,948
Sorry, guys, time's pretty tight
and we have to get the actors in.

212
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,242
Fine.
I promise I won't look.

213
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:33,956
Right, let's have
another look at that one, please.

214
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,512
And Jerry says if you can just
put your hands on her breasts.

215
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:49,722
All right, okay, yeah.
Is that all right?

216
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,140
Yes. Yeah, fine.

217
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,975
I'll warm them up.

218
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:57,396
And massage them, please.

219
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,564
Right.

220
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,363
It's junction 13 that's
just murder, isn't it?

221
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,824
Total gridlock this morning.

222
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:17,750
Jo and I had a lot of time
to prepare for this moment.

223
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,961
Some of her
requests, for instance,

224
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:26,425
that I should bring Claudia
Schiffer as my date to the funeral,

225
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:30,095
I was confident she
expected me to ignore.

226
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,515
But others she was
pretty damn clear about.

227
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:37,770
When she first mentioned
what's about to happen,

228
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,523
I said,
"Over my dead body."

229
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,735
And she said,
"No, Daniel, over mine."

230
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:48,030
And as usual,
my darling girl

231
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,950
and Sam's
darling mom was right.

232
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:58,499
So she's going to say her final
farewell to you not through me but,

233
00:15:58,665 --> 00:16:03,337
inevitably, ever so coolly,

234
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:08,675
through the immortal
genius of the Bay City Rollers.

235
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:38,675
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

236
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,694
Do you love him?

237
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,822
What?

238
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,409
No, I just thought I'd ask the blunt
question in case it was the right one

239
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,077
and you needed
someone to talk to about it

240
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,203
and no one had
ever asked you,

241
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,747
so you've never been able to talk
about it though you might've wanted to.

242
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:25,127
No. No. No is the
answer. No. Absolutely not.

243
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,548
So that's a no, then?

244
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,841
Yes.

245
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,308
This DJ,
what do you reckon?

246
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,352
The worst in history?
Probably.

247
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,771
I think it all hangs
on the next song.

248
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,648
<i>Now here's one
for the lovers.</i>

249
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,235
<i>That's quite a few of you, I
shouldn't be surprised and a half.</i>

250
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,662
He's done it, it's official.
Worst DJ in the world.

251
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,965
Sarah's waiting for you.

252
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:15,594
Yes, of course.

253
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,472
Great, good, good.

254
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,599
How are you doing, Mia?

255
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,726
Are you settling in fine?
Learning who to avoid?

256
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,519
Absolutely.

257
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,273
Harry?

258
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:32,736
Sarah, switch off your
phone and tell me exactly

259
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,864
how long it is that
you've been working here.

260
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,453
Two years, seven months,

261
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:44,248
three days and, I suppose,
what, two hours?

262
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:49,169
And how long have you been in love
with Karl, our enigmatic chief designer?

263
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,719
Two years,
seven months, three days

264
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,597
and, I suppose, an
hour and 30 minutes.

265
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,182
Thought as much.

266
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,393
Do you think everybody knows?
Yes.

267
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,561
Do you think Karl knows?
Yes.

268
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:10,899
That is...
That is bad news.

269
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,569
I just thought that
maybe the time had come

270
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,280
to do something about it.

271
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,740
Like what?

272
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,076
Invite him out for a drink, and
then after about 20 minutes,

273
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,662
casually drop into the conversation
the fact that you'd like to marry him

274
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,788
and have lots of sex
and babies.

275
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:27,165
You know that?
Yes.

276
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,793
And so does Karl.

277
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,879
Think about it,
for all our sakes.

278
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,507
It's Christmas.

279
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:41,930
Certainly. Excellent.
Will do. Thanks, boss.

280
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:45,976
Hi, Sarah.
Hi, Karl.

281
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,185
Excuse me.

282
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,782
Babe.
Absolutely, fire away.

283
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,328
Mia, Mia, would
you turn that down?

284
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,581
What is that?

285
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:11,585
And that was the Christmas
effort by the once great Billy Mack.

286
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,546
Oh, dear me, how
are the mighty fallen.

287
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,048
I can safely put my
hand up my ass and say

288
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:19,843
that is the worst record
I've heard this century...

289
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:24,514
And, coincidentally, I
believe Billy will be a guest

290
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,225
<i>on my friend Mike's show
in a few minutes' time.</i>

291
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,103
Welcome back, Bill.

292
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,731
So, Billy, welcome
back to the airwaves.

293
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,984
New Christmas single,
cover of <i>Love Is All Around.</i>

294
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:41,198
Except we've changed the
word "love" to "Christmas."

295
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,618
Yes, is that an important
message to you, Bill?

296
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,912
Not really, Mike.

297
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:51,541
Christmas is a time for people
with someone they love in their lives.

298
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,960
And that's not you?
That's not me, Michael.

299
00:20:54,252 --> 00:20:58,048
When I was young and
successful, I was greedy and foolish,

300
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:02,094
and now I'm left with no
one, wrinkled and alone.

301
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,138
Wow. Thanks for that, Bill.
For what?

302
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,933
Well, for actually giving
a real answer to a question.

303
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:11,686
It doesn't often happen here
at Radio Watford, I can tell you.

304
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,897
Ask me anything you like,
and I'll tell you the truth.

305
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,732
Best shag you ever had?

306
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:16,817
Britney Spears.

307
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,901
Wow.

308
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,529
No, only kidding!

309
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,072
She was rubbish.

310
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,532
Okay, here's one.

311
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:27,994
How do you think the new record
compares to your old, classic stuff?

312
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:31,665
Come on, Mikey, you know
as well as I do the record's crap.

313
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,711
But wouldn't it be great
if number one this Christmas

314
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,047
wasn't some
smug teenager

315
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:43,468
but an old ex-heroin addict
searching for a comeback at any price?

316
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,887
All those young popsters
come Christmas day,

317
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,808
they'll be stretched out naked with
a cute bird balancing on their balls

318
00:21:50,016 --> 00:21:53,478
and I'll be stuck in some
dingy flat with me manager, Joe,

319
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,564
ugliest man in the world,

320
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:59,943
fucking miserable because
our fucking gamble didn't pay off.

321
00:22:00,026 --> 00:22:05,073
So if you believe in Father Christmas,
children, like your Uncle Billy does,

322
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:09,244
buy my festering
turd of a record.

323
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,539
And particularly enjoy
the incredible crassness

324
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:16,751
of the moment when we try to squeeze
an extra syllable into the fourth line.

325
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,171
I think you're referring to,

326
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:21,882
"if you really
love Christmas..."

327
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,842
"Come on and let it snow."

328
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,053
So, here it is one more time,

329
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,557
the dark horse for this
year's Christmas number one,

330
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,477
<i>Christmas Is All Around.</i>
Thank you, Billy.

331
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,020
After this, the news.

332
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,814
Is the new prime
minister in trouble already?

333
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,238
Okay. What's next?

334
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,573
The President's visit.

335
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:50,160
Yes, yes. I fear this is going
to be a difficult one to play.

336
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,369
Alex.

337
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,164
There's a very strong
feeling in the party

338
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,041
we mustn't allow
ourselves to be bullied

339
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,417
from pillar to post
like the last government.

340
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,585
Hear, hear.

341
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,962
This is our first
really important test.

342
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,714
Let's take a stand.

343
00:23:02,797 --> 00:23:07,677
Right. Right. I understand
that, but I have decided

344
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,931
not to. Not this time.

345
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,933
We will, of course,
try to be clever.

346
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,769
But let's not forget that America is
the most powerful country in the world.

347
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,230
I'm not going to act
like a petulant child.

348
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,942
Right, who do you have
to screw around here

349
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,194
to get a cup of tea
and a chocolate biscuit?

350
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,369
Right.

351
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,081
Yeah, come in.

352
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:46,049
These have just come through from
the treasury and these are for you.

353
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,885
Excellent.
Thanks a lot.

354
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,263
I was hoping you'd win,

355
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,931
not that I wouldn't have been
nice to the other bloke, too.

356
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,850
Just always given him the
boring biscuits with no chocolate.

357
00:23:57,143 --> 00:23:58,979
Thanks very much. Thanks...

358
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:02,649
Natalie.

359
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:11,992
God, come on, get a grip. You're
the prime minister, for God's sake.

360
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,788
So what do you reckon to
our new prime minister then?

361
00:24:16,871 --> 00:24:21,001
I like him. I can't understand
why he's not married, though.

362
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:24,379
You know the type,
he's married to his job.

363
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,591
Either that or gay
as a picnic basket.

364
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,136
Excuse me, Judy, if you
could just lower the nipples

365
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,220
and cheat them
a bit to the left?

366
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,430
Okay.

367
00:24:37,183 --> 00:24:39,644
I have to say, Judy,
this is a real pleasure.

368
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,231
It's lovely to find someone
I can actually chat to.

369
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,483
Thank you.
Well, you know...

370
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,152
And ditto.
Thank you.

371
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,321
And the move again,
please, Judy.

372
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:50,947
Sorry.
God, sorry.

373
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,158
Are you all right?
Yeah, fine.

374
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,120
Exciting news!

375
00:24:57,203 --> 00:24:58,246
What?

376
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,916
I've bought a ticket to the
States. I'm off in three weeks.

377
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,209
No.
Yes!

378
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,296
To a fantastic
place called Wisconsin.

379
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,422
No!

380
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:11,009
Yes! Wisconsin
babes, here comes Sir Colin!

381
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:15,805
No, Col! There are a few
babes in America, I grant you,

382
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,516
but they're already going
out with rich, attractive guys.

383
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,478
Tone,
you're just jealous.

384
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:25,523
You know perfectly well that
any bar anywhere in America

385
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:30,111
contains 10 girls more beautiful
and more likely to have sex with me

386
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,529
than the whole of
the United Kingdom.

387
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,616
That is total bollocks.
You've actually gone mad now.

388
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:39,746
No, I'm wise. Stateside I am Prince
William without the weird family.

389
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,373
No, Colin, no!

390
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,208
Yes!

391
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,001
Ja, darling!

392
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,338
Right, the Christmas party,
not my favorite night of the year

393
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:51,007
and your unhappy
job to organize.

394
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,258
Tell me.

395
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,052
It's basic, really.

396
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:58,098
Find a venue, over-order on the
drinks, bulk buy the guacamole

397
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:02,102
and advise the girls to avoid Kevin
if they want their breasts unfondled.

398
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,312
Wives and family and stuff?

399
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,481
Yeah.
I mean, not children.

400
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:10,193
But their wives and
girlfriends, et cetera.

401
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:13,154
Oh, Christ, you haven't
got some horrible six-foot,

402
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,032
tight-T-shirt-wearing boyfriend
you'll be bringing, have you?

403
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:20,704
No. I'll just be hanging around
the mistletoe, hoping to be kissed.

404
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,373
Really?

405
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,042
Right.

406
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,638
He now spends all
the time in his room.

407
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,056
I mean,
he'll be up there now.

408
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,476
That's nothing unusual
about that. My horrid son...

409
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,728
Bernard?
Bernard.

410
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:48,565
Stays in his room all
the time. Thank goodness.

411
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,151
Yeah, but, Karen,
this is all the time.

412
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:56,281
I'm afraid that there's something
really wrong, you know?

413
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,742
I mean, clearly
it's about his mom,

414
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:03,955
but, Christ, he might be injecting
heroin into his eyeballs for all I know.

415
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,166
At the age of 11 ?

416
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,626
Well, maybe
not his eyeballs, then.

417
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,670
Maybe just his veins.

418
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,672
You see, the problem
is it was his mom

419
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,383
who always used to talk
to him, you know, and...

420
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:20,054
I don't know, this
whole stepfather thing

421
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:24,142
seems suddenly to somehow
matter like it never did before.

422
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:29,063
Listen, it was always
going to be a totally shit time.

423
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,690
Just be patient.

424
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,194
And maybe check
the room for needles.

425
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,905
And then when he
sometimes does come out,

426
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,115
it's obvious
he's been crying.

427
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,920
It's just such
a ridiculous waste.

428
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,298
And now if it's going to
ruin Sam's life as well...

429
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,259
I just don't know.

430
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:04,098
Get a grip.
People hate sissies.

431
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,352
No one's ever gonna shag
you if you cry all the time.

432
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:10,772
Yeah. Absolutely.

433
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,941
Helpful.

434
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:24,744
So, what's the
problem, Samuel?

435
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:30,917
Is it just Mom or
is it something else?

436
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,796
Maybe school?

437
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,715
Are you being bullied?

438
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,427
Or is it something worse?

439
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,515
Can you give me
any clues at all?

440
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,143
You really want to know?

441
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,478
I really want to know.

442
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,106
Even though you won't be
able to do anything to help?

443
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,483
Even if that's the case,
yeah.

444
00:28:57,443 --> 00:29:00,029
Okay. Well...

445
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,700
Truth is, actually,

446
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,244
I'm in love.

447
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,454
Sorry?

448
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,416
I know I should be thinking
about Mom all the time and I am,

449
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,126
but the truth is I'm in love.

450
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,753
I was before she died, and
there's nothing I can do about it.

451
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,675
Aren't you a bit
young to be in love?

452
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:21,801
No.

453
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,596
Well, okay, well...

454
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:29,017
I mean,
I'm a little relieved.

455
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,103
Why?
Because I

456
00:29:32,186 --> 00:29:34,397
thought it would
be something worse.

457
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,609
Worse than the total
agony of being in love?

458
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:44,198
No, you're right.
Total agony.

459
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,488
Night, Sarah.

460
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,781
Night, Karl.

461
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,459
Yeah, absolutely.

462
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,629
Free as a bird. Fire away.

463
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,454
Alone again.

464
00:31:14,872 --> 00:31:16,040
Naturally.

465
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,084
I'll deal with it.

466
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,335
All right.

467
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,880
Natalie.
Sir.

468
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,428
Thanks. Natalie.

469
00:31:31,597 --> 00:31:34,225
I'm starting to feel

470
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:39,355
uncomfortable about us working
in such close proximity every day

471
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,773
and me knowing so
little about you.

472
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:44,068
It seems...
It seems elitist and wrong.

473
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,487
Well, there's not much to know.

474
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:50,074
Well, where do you live,
for instance?

475
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,452
Wandsworth. The dodgy end.

476
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:56,205
My sister lives in Wandsworth.
Yeah.

477
00:31:57,331 --> 00:31:59,542
So which exactly
is the dodgy end?

478
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,377
Right at the end
of the High Street,

479
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,713
Harris Street,
near the Queen's Head.

480
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,840
Yeah, yeah, that is dodgy.

481
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:10,762
And you live with your
husband? Boyfriend?

482
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,639
Three illegitimate
but charming children?

483
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,766
No.

484
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,434
I've just split up with
my boyfriend, actually,

485
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:19,312
so I'm back with my
mom and dad for a while.

486
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,398
Sorry.

487
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,067
No, it's fine.

488
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:28,071
I'm well shot of him.
He said I was getting fat.

489
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,322
I beg your pardon?

490
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:33,409
He said no one's gonna fancy a girl
with thighs the size of big tree trunks.

491
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,995
Not a nice guy, actually,
in the end.

492
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,582
No.

493
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,883
You know,

494
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:52,512
being prime minister, I
could just have him murdered.

495
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,140
Thank you, sir.
I'll think about it.

496
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,311
Do. The SAS are
absolutely charming.

497
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:04,232
Ruthless, trained killers
are just a phone call away.

498
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:11,989
Oh, God.

499
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,786
Did you have this kind
of problem?

500
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,624
Yeah, course you did,
you saucy minx.

501
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,419
So, let's go.
We can definitely crack this.

502
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,964
Remember,
I was a kid once, too.

503
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:32,552
So, come on, it's
someone at school. Right?

504
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,262
Yeah.
Good, good.

505
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,640
And what does she,
he, feel about you?

506
00:33:37,723 --> 00:33:40,518
She doesn't even know my name.

507
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,187
And even if she did,
she'd despise me.

508
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,606
She's the coolest girl
in school,

509
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,693
and everyone worships
her because she's heaven.

510
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,655
Good. Good.

511
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:58,786
Well, basically
you're fucked, aren't you?

512
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,461
Hi there, and welcome back.

513
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,589
So, Billy, three weeks
till Christmas,

514
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,924
looks like the real
competition is gonna be Blue.

515
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:14,552
Yeah, I saw them on
the show last week.

516
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,387
They weren't very nice
about my record.

517
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,930
No. Little scamps.

518
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,435
But very, very
talented musicians.

519
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:26,564
Yeah. Billy, I understand you've got
a prize for our competition winners.

520
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:32,195
Yes, I have, Ant or Dec. It's
a personalized felt-tip pen.

521
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,863
Great.

522
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:37,783
It's brilliant. It even
writes on glass,

523
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,244
so if you've got
a framed picture,

524
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,622
like, for instance,
this one of Blue,

525
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,707
you can just write on it.

526
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,973
A lot of kids
watching, Billy.

527
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,266
Yeah.

528
00:35:02,808 --> 00:35:05,478
Hiya, kids.

529
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:08,648
Here's an important
message from your Uncle Bill.

530
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,942
Don't buy drugs.

531
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,988
Become a pop star and
they give you them for free.

532
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,741
And I do
believe it's a commercial break.

533
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:21,118
Thank goodness. We'll
see you soon. Bye-bye.

534
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,424
Look at him!

535
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,385
Just a minute.

536
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,929
Actually, they're not
funny. They're art.

537
00:35:44,558 --> 00:35:46,936
Okay, let's say
Thursday, my place.

538
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,563
Great. But for now I've
got Juliet on the other line.

539
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,941
Can I patch you through?
She wants to ask you a favor.

540
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,609
Okay, fine.

541
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,612
Thanks and be nice.

542
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,239
I'm always nice.

543
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,701
<i>You know what I mean,
Marky, be friendly.</i>

544
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,869
<i>- I'm always...</i>
- Mark?

545
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,164
Hi. How was the honeymoon?

546
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,293
It was great. And thanks
for the gorgeous sendoff.

547
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,752
So, what can I do for you?

548
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,504
<i>It's only a tiny favor.</i>

549
00:36:13,587 --> 00:36:16,674
I've just tried the wedding
video, and it's a complete disaster.

550
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,634
<i>It's come out
all blue and wibbly.</i>

551
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,719
I'm sorry.

552
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,887
I remember you
filming a lot in the day

553
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,723
and I just wondered if I
could look at your stuff.

554
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,725
No, look, to be
honest, I didn't really...

555
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:29,061
Please. All I want is just one
shot of me in a wedding dress

556
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,938
that isn't bright turquoise.

557
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,858
Okay, I'll have a look, but to be
honest, I'm pretty sure I wiped it,

558
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,693
so don't get any hopes up.

559
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,111
<i>Must go.</i>

560
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,828
Any progress with
our matchmaking plans?

561
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:49,957
No. I've done fuck-all and never
will because he's too good for me.

562
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,043
How true.

563
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,546
Stop.

564
00:36:55,629 --> 00:36:57,798
And, of course,
your mobile goes.

565
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,761
Hello. Hi. How you doing?

566
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,555
So, how's the
Christmas party going?

567
00:37:04,638 --> 00:37:05,723
Good.

568
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,850
Think I've found a venue.
Friend of mine works there.

569
00:37:07,933 --> 00:37:09,852
What's it like?

570
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:11,187
Good. Good.

571
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,484
It's an art gallery. Full of dark
corners for doing dark deeds.

572
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,113
Right.

573
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,617
Good. Well,
I suppose I should

574
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,619
take a look at
it or something.

575
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,913
You should.

576
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,432
Ah, hello, Eleonore.

577
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,892
Hello, Monsieur Bennett.

578
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:53,771
Welcome back. And this year
you bring a lady guest?

579
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,941
No. There's a change
of situation. Just me.

580
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,610
Am I sad or not sad?

581
00:37:59,693 --> 00:38:01,320
I think you're not surprised.

582
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,239
And you stay
here till Christmas?

583
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,365
Yeah, yeah.

584
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:09,453
Good. Well, I find you a
perfect lady to clean the house.

585
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,123
This is Aurelia.

586
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:19,296
- Er, hello, Aurelia.
- Hello.

587
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:24,260
I'm happy to have you here.

588
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,681
Unfortunately, she cannot
speak French, just like you.

589
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,933
She's Portuguese.

590
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,686
Ah, ah, good day.

591
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,940
Very good...

592
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,986
I think she's 10 years
too young to remember

593
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,321
there was a footballer
called Eusebio.

594
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,699
And <i>"molto bueno"</i> is Spanish.

595
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,325
Right. Right.

596
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,162
Anyway, it's nice
to meet you and...

597
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,914
Perhaps you can drive her
home at the end of her work?

598
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:54,623
Absolutely, yes.

599
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:57,293
With great pleasure.

600
00:38:58,043 --> 00:38:59,962
Which is what? Turkish?

601
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,972
Beautiful.

602
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:13,309
Er, beautiful.

603
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,904
No, right.
Silence is golden.

604
00:39:27,072 --> 00:39:28,949
As the Tremeloes said.

605
00:39:31,076 --> 00:39:33,871
Clever guys, although I
think the original version

606
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:37,917
was by Frankie Valli
& the Four Seasons.

607
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:40,044
Great band.

608
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:43,923
Shut up.

609
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,436
Mr. President!

610
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,022
Over here, sir!

611
00:40:00,105 --> 00:40:02,024
What will you
be talking about?

612
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,986
Mr. President, welcome.

613
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,363
It's a pleasure to meet you.

614
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,739
Come on through.

615
00:40:08,822 --> 00:40:10,074
I'm sorry your wife
couldn't make it, by the way.

616
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:13,661
So is she. Although she would
have been kind of lonely, I'm sure.

617
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:18,165
Yes. Pathetic, isn't it? Just
never been able to tie a girl down.

618
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,918
Not sure that politics and
dating really go together.

619
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:24,088
Really?
I've never found that.

620
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,923
Yeah, well, the difference is
you're still sickeningly handsome,

621
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,926
whereas I look increasingly
like my Aunt Mildred.

622
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,803
Very jealous of your plane,
by the way.

623
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,639
Thank you. We love that
thing, I'll tell you.

624
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,599
Natalie. Hi.

625
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,102
Morning, ma'am.
How's your day so far?

626
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,397
Excellent.

627
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,528
My goodness, that's a pretty
little son of a bitch, right there.

628
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,572
Did you see those pipes?

629
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:53,158
Yeah, yeah,
she's terrific at her job.

630
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:57,913
No, absolutely not. We cannot
and will not consult on that, either.

631
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,790
That is unexpected.

632
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,126
Well, it shouldn't be.

633
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:05,254
The last administration
made it perfectly clear.

634
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,965
We're just being
consistent with their policies.

635
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:10,884
Well, with all respect,
sir, they were bad policies.

636
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,845
All right, thanks, Alex.

637
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:18,559
I don't think we're making progress
here. Let's move on, shall we?

638
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,523
Well, now, that was
an interesting day.

639
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,943
Sorry if our line was firm,

640
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,029
but there's no point in
tiptoeing around today,

641
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,740
then just disappointing you
for four years.

642
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:36,118
I mean, I have plans and I
plan to see them through.

643
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:39,121
Absolutely. Now, there is one
final thing I think we should look at.

644
00:41:39,204 --> 00:41:42,041
It's very close to my heart.
Just give me a second.

645
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,835
I'll give you anything
you ask for.

646
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,172
As long as it's not
something I don't wanna give.

647
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,845
Hi.

648
00:41:54,928 --> 00:41:56,930
Pathetic.

649
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,286
It's great Scotch.

650
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:24,041
I'll...
I'll be going, then.

651
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,295
Natalie,

652
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:31,840
I hope to see much more of
you as our two great countries

653
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,676
work toward
a better future.

654
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,594
Thank you, sir.

655
00:42:52,986 --> 00:42:54,655
Yes, Peter.

656
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,199
Mr. President,
has it been a good visit?

657
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,244
Very satisfactory indeed.

658
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,621
We got what we came for,

659
00:43:03,288 --> 00:43:06,375
and our special relationship
is still very special.

660
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,877
And, Prime Minister?

661
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,213
I love that word
"relationship."

662
00:43:11,296 --> 00:43:13,632
Covers all manner of sins,
doesn't it?

663
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,636
I fear that this has
become a bad relationship,

664
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:22,641
a relationship based on the
President taking exactly what he wants

665
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:27,813
and casually ignoring all
those things that really matter to

666
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:32,735
Britain.

667
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:36,780
We may be a small country,
but we're a great one, too.

668
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,242
The country of Shakespeare,
Churchill, The Beatles,

669
00:43:40,325 --> 00:43:42,202
Sean Connery, Harry Potter.

670
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:49,126
David Beckham's right foot. David
Beckham's left foot, come to that.

671
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:53,297
And a friend who bullies
us is no longer a friend.

672
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:56,675
And since bullies only respond
to strength, from now onward,

673
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,345
I will be prepared
to be much stronger.

674
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,514
And the President
should be prepared for that.

675
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,694
Mr. President!

676
00:44:20,365 --> 00:44:21,366
Joe.

677
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,369
It's your sister on line four.

678
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,080
All right.

679
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,250
Yes, I'm very busy and
important. How can I help you?

680
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,377
Have you gone
completely insane?

681
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,254
You can't be sensible
all the time.

682
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,048
<i>You can if you're
prime minister.</i>

683
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,342
Oh, dear, it's the Chancellor of
the Exchequer on the other line.

684
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,426
<i>No, it isn't!</i>
I'll call you back.

685
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,844
No, you won't!

686
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,808
The trouble with being
the prime minister's sister is

687
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:49,019
it does put your life into
rather harsh perspective.

688
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:53,023
What did my brother do today? He
stood up and fought for his country.

689
00:44:53,106 --> 00:44:57,236
And what did I do? I made
a papier-mâché lobster head.

690
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,197
What is this
we're listening to?

691
00:45:00,405 --> 00:45:02,324
Joni Mitchell.

692
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:05,285
I can't believe you still
listen to Joni Mitchell.

693
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:09,164
I love her and true
love lasts a lifetime.

694
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,251
Joni Mitchell is
the woman who taught

695
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:15,420
your cold English wife
how to feel.

696
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,588
Did she?
Well, that's good.

697
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:19,341
I must write to her
sometime and say thanks.

698
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,554
Now, which doll should we
give Daisy's little friend Emily?

699
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,389
The one that looks
like a transvestite

700
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,683
or the one that looks
like a dominatrix?

701
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,271
<i>It's almost
enough to make you feel patriotic,</i>

702
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,481
<i>so here's one for our
ass-kicking prime minister.</i>

703
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,108
<i>I think he'll enjoy this.</i>

704
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:38,735
<i>A golden oldie
for a golden oldie.</i>

705
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,579
Yeah...

706
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,623
Mary, I've been thinking,

707
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:36,126
can we move the Japanese
ambassador to 4:00 tomorrow?

708
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:37,252
Certainly, sir.

709
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,254
Terrific.
Thanks so much.

710
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,389
Would you like the last...

711
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,308
Thank you very much... but no.

712
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,602
If you saw my sister,
you'd understand why.

713
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,146
That's all right,
more for me.

714
00:46:56,355 --> 00:47:00,067
Just don't go eating it all yourself.
You're getting chubbier every day.

715
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,527
I'm very lucky I've got
one of those constitutions

716
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,321
where I never
put on weight.

717
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,158
Hello.

718
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,795
Sorry.

719
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,008
Hello?

720
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:41,149
Thank you.

721
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:44,528
No! I am so sorry.

722
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,612
No. Hold on.

723
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:46,405
It's a disaster.

724
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,241
God, it's half the book. No.

725
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,494
Just leave them, please!
They're not important.

726
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:55,539
They're not worth it!

727
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,833
Stop! Stop.

728
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,548
It's all just rubbish.

729
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:08,468
Just leave it.

730
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,149
God, she's in.

731
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:27,446
Right. And now she'll think I'm
a total spaz if I don't go in too.

732
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,282
Fuck - it's cold!

733
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,496
Fuck, it's freezing! Fuck!

734
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,875
This stuff better be good.

735
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,503
It's not worth it. This
isn't bloody Shakespeare.

736
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:47,299
I don't want to drown saving some shit
my grandmother could have written.

737
00:48:48,633 --> 00:48:49,718
Just stop. Stop.

738
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,471
What kind of idiot doesn't make copies?

739
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,890
I really must do copies.

740
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,435
There'd better not be eels
in here. I can't stand eels.

741
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:01,188
Try not to disturb the eels.

742
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,690
Oh, God,
what the hell is that?

743
00:49:13,658 --> 00:49:15,911
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

744
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:23,585
I know. I'll name one of
the characters after you.

745
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:26,505
Maybe you could name
one of the characters after me.

746
00:49:27,672 --> 00:49:30,133
Or give me 50% of the profits.

747
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:34,638
Or I could give you
5% of the profits.

748
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,393
What kind of book is it?

749
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:53,365
Yes. It's...

750
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,577
Thriller... crime...

751
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,706
Crime. Crime, murder.

752
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,587
Scary? Yes,
sometimes scary.

753
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:12,175
And sometimes not. Mainly
scary how bad the writing is.

754
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:28,525
I'd better get back to work.

755
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,196
And then later you'll drive me home?

756
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,364
Sure.

757
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:41,705
It's my favorite time of day,

758
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,832
driving you.

759
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:49,754
It's the saddest part of my day,
leaving you.

760
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:57,971
Sorry.

761
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,835
<i>And coming
up later this morning, it's this guy...</i>

762
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,927
<i>The bad granddad
of rock and roll,</i>

763
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,763
<i>here at 10:</i><i>30.
Do not switch off.</i>

764
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:47,562
Banoffee pie?

765
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,564
No, thanks.

766
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:52,984
Thank God. You would've
broken my heart if you'd said yes.

767
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:56,404
Right, well, lucky you.

768
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,615
Can I come in?

769
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:00,659
Yeah, well,
I'm a bit busy...

770
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,744
Well, I was just passing,
and I thought

771
00:52:02,827 --> 00:52:05,205
we might check
that video thing out.

772
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,333
I thought I might be able
to swap it for some pie

773
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,794
or maybe Munchies?

774
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:13,338
Actually, I was being serious.
I don't know where it is.

775
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,632
I'll have a poke
around tonight then...

776
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:18,468
Mark, can I say something?

777
00:52:18,551 --> 00:52:20,553
Yeah.

778
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,765
I know you're Peter's
best friend,

779
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:29,145
and I know you've never
particularly warmed to me.

780
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,314
No, don't argue.

781
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,567
We've never
got friendly.

782
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:37,195
But I just wanted to say,
I hope that can change.

783
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:39,114
I'm nice.
I really am.

784
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:41,700
Apart from my terrible
taste in pie and...

785
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,328
It would be great if
we could be friends.

786
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,956
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

787
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:52,919
Great.

788
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,007
Doesn't mean we'll be able
to find the video, though.

789
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,050
I had a real search
when you first called

790
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,760
and couldn't find
any trace of it so...

791
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,972
Well, there's one here that
says, "Peter and Juliet's Wedding."

792
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:06,308
Do you think we might
be on the right track?

793
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:10,937
Yeah, well...
Wow. That could be it.

794
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,397
Do you mind if I just...

795
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,481
I've probably
taped over it.

796
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:16,651
Almost everything has
episodes of <i>West Wing</i> on it and...

797
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,825
Oh, bingo.

798
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,829
That's lovely.

799
00:53:27,912 --> 00:53:29,748
Well done, you.

800
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,460
That's gorgeous.

801
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:38,923
Thank you so much, Mark. This
is exactly what I was hoping for.

802
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,183
I look quite pretty.

803
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,733
You've stayed rather close,
haven't you?

804
00:54:51,996 --> 00:54:53,248
They're all of me.

805
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:01,172
Yeah. Yeah.

806
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,258
Yes.

807
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,707
But

808
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,835
you never talk to me.

809
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:43,089
You always talk to Peter.

810
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,927
You don't like me.

811
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:51,306
I hope it's useful.

812
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:54,392
Don't show it
around too much.

813
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:57,562
Needs a bit of editing.

814
00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:01,274
Look, I've got
to get to a lunch.

815
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,401
Early lunch.

816
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:06,488
You can just show
yourself out, can't you?

817
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:16,331
It's a self-preservation
thing, you see.

818
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,183
Yeah.

819
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:23,106
Annie, my darling,
my dream, my boat.

820
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,236
Need you to do
a favor for me.

821
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,447
Of course. Anything
for the hero of the hour.

822
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:36,160
Don't ask me why, and for heaven's
sake, don't read stuff into this,

823
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,580
it's just a weird
personality thing.

824
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,749
But you know Natalie
who works here?

825
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:44,460
The chubby girl?

826
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,546
Would we call her chubby?

827
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:49,799
I think there's a pretty
size able ass there, yes, sir.

828
00:57:50,174 --> 00:57:51,551
Huge thighs.

829
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:55,221
Yeah. Well, whatever.

830
00:57:56,556 --> 00:58:00,268
I'm sure she's a lovely
girl, but I wonder if you could

831
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,689
redistribute her?

832
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:08,192
It's done.

833
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,104
Hey, Sammo. Can't sleep?

834
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,191
I got some
terrible news today.

835
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:50,151
Let's have it.

836
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:52,153
Joanna's going
back to America.

837
00:58:52,236 --> 00:58:53,488
Your girl's American?

838
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,907
Yes, she's American.

839
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:58,242
And she's not my girl.

840
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:00,203
And she's going
back to America.

841
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,246
That's the end of
my life as I know it.

842
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,666
That is bad news.

843
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:09,128
Well, we need Kate

844
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:12,256
and we need Leo,
and we need them now.

845
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,175
Come on.

846
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,556
<i>Hold on. Hold on.</i>

847
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:23,184
<i>Keep your eyes closed.</i>

848
00:59:23,267 --> 00:59:24,977
<i>Do you trust me?</i>

849
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,021
<i>I trust you.</i>

850
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,482
Do you trust me?

851
00:59:29,565 --> 00:59:30,858
I trust you.

852
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:32,110
Fool!

853
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:33,986
Get off, you big bully.

854
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:39,075
<i>All right, open your eyes.</i>

855
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:46,165
You know, Sammy, I'm sure
she's unique and extraordinary,

856
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,085
but general wisdom
is that in the end,

857
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:51,546
there isn't just one
person for each of us.

858
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,675
There was
for Kate and Leo.

859
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,469
There was for you.

860
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,388
And there is for me.

861
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:02,432
She's the one.

862
01:00:04,308 --> 01:00:07,061
Fair enough.
And her name's Joanna?

863
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:10,898
Yeah, I know. Same as Mom.

864
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:22,493
Yeah.

865
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:28,416
Prime Minister.

866
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:30,126
Thank you very much.

867
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,852
Oh. Apology.

868
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:52,899
Big, er... big family,
big tradition of Christmas presents.

869
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,567
Stupid.

870
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:24,013
Well, goodbye.

871
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,681
Thank you.

872
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,312
It was...

873
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,523
I will miss you.

874
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:39,654
And your very slow typing...

875
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:43,491
and your very bad driving.

876
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:49,015
<i>You know I
love Christmas, I always will</i>

877
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:54,729
<i>My mind's made up,
the way that I feel</i>

878
01:02:56,188 --> 01:03:00,318
<i>There's no beginning,
there'll be no end</i>

879
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,415
Daniel!

880
01:03:15,499 --> 01:03:16,834
I have a plan.

881
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,420
Thank the Lord! Tell me.

882
01:03:19,795 --> 01:03:23,257
Well, girls love musicians,
don't they? Uh-huh.

883
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,676
Even the really weird ones
get girlfriends. That's right.

884
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,929
Meat Loaf definitely
got laid at least once.

885
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:31,057
For God's sake, Ringo
Starr married a Bond girl.

886
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:36,395
Whatever. There's this big concert
at the end of term and Joanna's in it.

887
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:40,107
And I thought maybe if I was in the
band and played absolutely superbly,

888
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,318
there's a chance that she
might actually fall in love with me.

889
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:43,444
What do you think?

890
01:03:43,527 --> 01:03:46,238
I think it's brilliant.
I think it's stellar.

891
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:50,034
Apart from the one obvious
tiny, little, baby, little hiccup.

892
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:52,370
I don't play
a musical instrument?

893
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:53,537
Yes, sir.

894
01:03:54,538 --> 01:03:56,540
A tiny, insignificant detail.

895
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:36,706
I suppose I'd better go
and do the duty round.

896
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:38,791
You're a saint.

897
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:48,634
Any chance of a dance
with the boss?

898
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:51,846
Yeah, sure, sure.

899
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,598
As long as your boyfriend
doesn't mind.

900
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,311
Not my boyfriend.

901
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:16,662
You're looking
very pretty tonight.

902
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:20,458
It's for you.

903
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,253
Sorry?

904
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:28,758
It's all for you, sir.

905
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,783
<i>This must be a very
exciting moment for you,</i>

906
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:55,951
<i>fighting for the
Christmas number one.</i>

907
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:57,453
<i>How's it looking so far?</i>

908
01:05:57,536 --> 01:05:58,996
<i>Very bad indeed.</i>

909
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:02,458
<i>Blue are outselling me
five-to-one,</i>

910
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:04,752
<i>but I'm hoping
for a late surge.</i>

911
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,547
<i>And, if I reach number one,</i>

912
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:14,553
<i>I promise to sing a song stark
naked on TV on Christmas Eve.</i>

913
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:16,847
<i>Do you mean that?</i>

914
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,182
<i>Well, of course
I mean it, Michael.</i>

915
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:20,810
<i>Do you want a preview?
You old flirt.</i>

916
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,899
<i>That'll never
make number one.</i>

917
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:37,284
I suppose it's his job to
dance with everyone, isn't it?

918
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:39,662
Some more than others.

919
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:44,959
Just one dance?

920
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,669
Before we run
out of chances.

921
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:48,504
Who, me?

922
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:50,256
Unless you just...

923
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:52,466
No! No! Good.

924
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,635
Yes. Thanks.

925
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:26,101
Well, then.
I'd better go.

926
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,270
Okay.

927
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:31,899
Good night.
Good night.

928
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:50,960
Actually,

929
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:53,254
I don't have to go.
Right. Good.

930
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,589
I mean...
No, that's good.

931
01:08:56,757 --> 01:09:00,135
Just... Would you excuse
me for one second?

932
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:02,680
Sure.
Just one second.

933
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:13,065
Okay, that's done.

934
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:18,946
Why don't you come
upstairs in about 10 seconds?

935
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:21,323
Ten seconds.
Ten seconds.

936
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,177
Just tug it.

937
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,386
Okay.

938
01:10:45,949 --> 01:10:47,451
You're beautiful.

939
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,019
I'd better answer that.

940
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:21,527
Hello. Hi.
Hello, darling.

941
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:24,488
No, no, I'm not
busy. No, fire away.

942
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:27,241
Right.

943
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:31,703
Yes, I... I'm not quite
sure it's gonna be possible

944
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:34,206
to get the Pope on
the phone tonight but...

945
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:41,004
Yes. Yes, I'm sure he's
very good at exorcism but...

946
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:46,844
Well, I'm sure

947
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:50,764
Jon Bon Jovi is as well,
and I'll definitely look into it.

948
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:54,560
Okay? Okay,
I'll talk to you later.

949
01:11:54,726 --> 01:11:56,728
All right, bye-bye.

950
01:12:01,942 --> 01:12:03,902
Sorry about that.

951
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,904
No, it's fine.

952
01:12:06,071 --> 01:12:08,949
It's my brother. He's
not well. He calls a lot.

953
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:13,454
I'm sorry.
No, it's fine. It's fine.

954
01:12:13,537 --> 01:12:16,790
I mean, it's not really
fine. It is what it is,

955
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:20,335
and sort of there being no parents
now, and us being over here,

956
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:23,464
it's my job to keep an eye
on him. I mean, not my job.

957
01:12:23,547 --> 01:12:25,591
Obviously,
I'm glad to do it...

958
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,426
That's okay.

959
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:31,346
I mean, life is full of
interruptions and complications.

960
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,184
So...

961
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:54,161
Will it make him better?

962
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:57,247
No.

963
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,333
Then maybe

964
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:02,169
don't answer.

965
01:13:09,968 --> 01:13:12,221
Hey. How you doing?

966
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:16,016
Right, right. No, please.

967
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,478
Please, please,
don't, little darling.

968
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:24,107
Between the two of us we'll find
the answer and it won't hurt anymore.

969
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:28,153
No, no.
No, I'm not busy. I...

970
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:33,116
Of course if you want
me to come over I will.

971
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,954
Okay.

972
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,840
That was a good night.

973
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:50,300
Except I felt fat.

974
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:51,593
Don't be ridiculous.

975
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:53,095
It's true.

976
01:13:53,178 --> 01:13:57,349
Nowadays the only clothes I can
get into were once owned by Pavarotti.

977
01:13:57,432 --> 01:14:00,227
I always think
Pavarotti dresses very well.

978
01:14:04,022 --> 01:14:06,024
Mia's very pretty.

979
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:10,028
Is she?

980
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:14,366
You know she is, darling.

981
01:14:14,449 --> 01:14:16,577
Be careful there.

982
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:42,436
Have you been watching
stuff on TV?

983
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:45,564
Yeah.

984
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,692
Every night.
Good.

985
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:50,861
And every day.

986
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,202
The nurses are
trying to kill me.

987
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:01,413
Nobody's trying
to kill you, babe.

988
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:11,131
Thank you.

989
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:16,178
Don't do that, my darling.

990
01:15:18,513 --> 01:15:20,515
Thank you.

991
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:29,566
Don't do that.

992
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:05,227
Right. Back at 3:00.
Christmas shopping,

993
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:06,978
never an easy or
a pleasant task.

994
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:08,980
Are you gonna
get me something?

995
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:15,654
I don't know,
I hadn't thought.

996
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,614
And where's Sarah,
by the way?

997
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:20,325
She couldn't make it
in today. Family thing.

998
01:16:20,492 --> 01:16:24,079
There's a word for hangover
I've never heard before.

999
01:16:24,579 --> 01:16:25,872
See you later.

1000
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:28,583
Yes. Looking forward to it.

1001
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:33,714
A lot.

1002
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:48,228
So are you gonna
give me something?

1003
01:16:49,229 --> 01:16:51,690
I thought I made
it clear last night.

1004
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:54,317
When it comes to me,
you can have everything.

1005
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:59,114
So, what do you need?

1006
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:04,202
Something along the stationery
line? Are you short of staplers?

1007
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:07,998
No. I don't want
something I need.

1008
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:11,376
I want something I want,
something pretty.

1009
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:14,421
Right.

1010
01:17:15,839 --> 01:17:17,382
Right.

1011
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:28,685
Sorry I'm late. I had to
drop off Bernie at rehearsal.

1012
01:17:32,856 --> 01:17:35,233
Right, well, listen, you keep
yourself occupied for 10 minutes

1013
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:38,361
while I go and do the
boring stuff for our mothers.

1014
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:02,886
Thank you.
Thank you.

1015
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,388
Looking for anything
in particular, sir?

1016
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:08,975
Yes. That necklace there,
how much is it?

1017
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,353
It's £270.

1018
01:18:13,146 --> 01:18:15,857
All right. I'll have it.

1019
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,108
Lovely.

1020
01:18:20,111 --> 01:18:23,073
Would you like
it gift-wrapped?

1021
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:25,200
Yes, all right.

1022
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:26,409
Lovely.

1023
01:18:28,995 --> 01:18:31,164
Let me just
pop it in the box.

1024
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:34,501
There.

1025
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:37,212
Look,
could we be quite quick?

1026
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:38,630
Certainly, sir.

1027
01:18:38,713 --> 01:18:41,466
Ready in
the flashiest of flashes.

1028
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:50,100
There.
That's great.

1029
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:53,311
Not quite finished.

1030
01:18:56,189 --> 01:18:57,566
Look, actually,
I don't need a bag.

1031
01:18:57,649 --> 01:18:59,276
I'll just put
it in my pocket.

1032
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:00,861
This isn't a bag, sir.

1033
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:02,487
Really?

1034
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,656
This is so much
more than a bag.

1035
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,973
Could we be quite quick, please?

1036
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,746
What's that?

1037
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:54,581
It's a cinnamon stick, sir.

1038
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:56,333
Actually,
I really can't wait.

1039
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:58,043
You won't regret it, sir.

1040
01:19:58,126 --> 01:19:59,711
Want to bet?

1041
01:19:59,794 --> 01:20:02,380
'Tis but
the work of a moment.

1042
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:08,219
There we go.
Almost finished.

1043
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:10,055
Almost finished?
What else can there be?

1044
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:11,389
Are you gonna
dip it in yogurt?

1045
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:12,891
Cover it with
chocolate buttons?

1046
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:15,936
No, sir, we're going to
pop it in the Christmas box.

1047
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:17,479
But I don't want
a Christmas box.

1048
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:18,939
But you said you wanted it
gift-wrapped.

1049
01:20:19,022 --> 01:20:20,106
I did but...

1050
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:21,441
This is the final flourish.

1051
01:20:21,524 --> 01:20:22,567
Can I just pay?

1052
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:23,818
All we need now...

1053
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:25,362
Oh, God.

1054
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:26,446
...is a sprig of holly.

1055
01:20:26,529 --> 01:20:27,572
No, no, no, no.

1056
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:29,449
No bloody holly.
But, sir...

1057
01:20:29,532 --> 01:20:31,660
Leave it. Leave it.
Just leave it.

1058
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:33,954
Loitering around the
jewelry section, I see.

1059
01:20:34,037 --> 01:20:35,747
No. I was just looking around.

1060
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:38,667
Don't worry. My
expectations are not that high

1061
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:42,253
after 13 years of Mr. Oh-
but-you-always-love-scarves.

1062
01:20:42,837 --> 01:20:44,798
Actually,
I do love this one.

1063
01:20:55,475 --> 01:20:56,518
Hey!

1064
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:58,687
What are you doing here?

1065
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:02,065
Had to rent out my
flat to pay for my ticket.

1066
01:21:02,148 --> 01:21:05,402
You're not actually going ahead
with this genuinely stupid plan?

1067
01:21:05,485 --> 01:21:07,278
Yeah. I bloody am.

1068
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:10,782
You think this backpack is
full of clothes? Like hell it is.

1069
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:13,576
It is chock-a-block
full of condoms.

1070
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:17,497
Excellent. Excellent.
Perfect, keep that going.

1071
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:23,545
Look, sorry to be a
bit forward and all that,

1072
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:26,214
but you don't fancy going
for a Christmas drink, do you?

1073
01:21:26,297 --> 01:21:28,466
I mean,
nothing implied at all.

1074
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:33,513
Just maybe go and see something
Christmassy or something.

1075
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:37,058
Obviously, if you don't
want to, you don't have to. I...

1076
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:38,768
I'm rambling now, sorry.

1077
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:41,688
No. That would be lovely.

1078
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:44,566
Great.

1079
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:50,405
You know,
that is really great.

1080
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:52,282
Normally, I'm really shy
about this sort of thing.

1081
01:21:52,365 --> 01:21:55,118
Takes me ages to get the
courage up, so thank you.

1082
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,585
Explain to me again
why you're so late.

1083
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:06,880
For heaven's sake, woman,
can't a man have any secrets?

1084
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:11,217
We've been waiting for hours.
It's the first ever preview.

1085
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:24,022
It was a starry
night in ancient Jerusalem

1086
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:27,192
and the baby Jesus was
in his manger.

1087
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:38,912
Sherlock Holmes is
not a real detective.

1088
01:22:42,373 --> 01:22:45,627
I would like
half-pint of sherry.

1089
01:22:46,544 --> 01:22:49,089
I would like
a one-day travel card.

1090
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,883
Oh, my God, I've got a terrible
stomach ache.

1091
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:54,427
It must have been the prawns.

1092
01:22:54,969 --> 01:22:58,098
Milton Keynes has
many roundabouts.

1093
01:22:59,390 --> 01:23:03,269
My goodness, this is a very big fish!

1094
01:23:03,686 --> 01:23:06,147
It tastes delicious!

1095
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:23,164
You'll come back
a broken man.

1096
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:26,251
Yeah, back broken
from too much sex.

1097
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:28,503
You are on
the road to disaster.

1098
01:23:28,586 --> 01:23:32,132
No, I am on shag highway,
heading west.

1099
01:23:32,632 --> 01:23:34,801
Farewell, failure.

1100
01:23:34,884 --> 01:23:38,638
America, watch out!
Here comes Colin Frissell.

1101
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:42,725
And he's got a big knob.

1102
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:54,279
Take me to a bar.

1103
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:55,488
What kind of bar?

1104
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:59,075
Just any bar. Just
your average American bar.

1105
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:07,584
Can I help you?

1106
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:10,086
Yes. I'd like a Budweiser,
please.

1107
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:11,629
King of beers.

1108
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:13,214
One Bud coming up.

1109
01:24:14,507 --> 01:24:15,842
Oh, my God.

1110
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:19,012
Are you from England?

1111
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:21,264
Yes.

1112
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:25,852
That is so cute.

1113
01:24:25,935 --> 01:24:28,104
Hi, I'm Stacey.

1114
01:24:29,647 --> 01:24:31,649
Jeannie?

1115
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:34,944
Yeah?

1116
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:37,614
This is...

1117
01:24:37,697 --> 01:24:38,990
Colin.

1118
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:42,619
Frissell.

1119
01:24:42,702 --> 01:24:44,495
Cute name.

1120
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:46,247
Jeannie.

1121
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:47,582
He's from England.

1122
01:24:47,665 --> 01:24:49,792
Yep. Basildon.

1123
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:55,840
Wait till
Carol-Anne gets here.

1124
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:57,842
She's crazy
about English guys.

1125
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:04,265
Hey, girls.

1126
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:06,768
Carol-Anne, come meet Colin.

1127
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:08,353
He's from England.

1128
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:14,025
Well, step aside, ladies.
This one's on me.

1129
01:25:16,736 --> 01:25:18,696
Hey, gorgeous.

1130
01:25:21,407 --> 01:25:22,992
That is so funny!

1131
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:26,454
What do you call that?

1132
01:25:26,537 --> 01:25:27,789
Bottle.

1133
01:25:27,872 --> 01:25:29,332
Bottle.

1134
01:25:29,415 --> 01:25:31,376
What about this?
Straw.

1135
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,211
Straw.

1136
01:25:33,294 --> 01:25:35,213
What about this?
Table.

1137
01:25:36,589 --> 01:25:38,549
Table. The same.
It's the same.

1138
01:25:39,342 --> 01:25:40,760
Where are you staying?

1139
01:25:40,843 --> 01:25:42,679
I don't actually know.

1140
01:25:42,762 --> 01:25:44,931
I guess I'll just check into a
motel like they do in the movies.

1141
01:25:45,014 --> 01:25:48,268
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, that is so cute.

1142
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:52,814
No, no, no, listen. This may be a
bit pushy 'cause we just met you,

1143
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:55,566
but why don't you come
back and sleep at our place?

1144
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:57,735
Yeah.

1145
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:00,947
Well, I mean, you know, if it's
not too much of an inconvenience.

1146
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:02,573
Hell no!

1147
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:04,284
But there's one problem.

1148
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:06,577
What?

1149
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:09,956
Well, we're not the
richest of girls, you know.

1150
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:14,794
So we just have
a little bed and no couch.

1151
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:18,339
So you'd have to
share with all three of us.

1152
01:26:18,923 --> 01:26:24,846
And on this cold, cold night it's
gonna be crowded and sweaty and stuff.

1153
01:26:24,929 --> 01:26:27,849
And we can't even
afford pajamas.

1154
01:26:28,308 --> 01:26:29,392
No?

1155
01:26:30,393 --> 01:26:33,938
Which means we
would be naked.

1156
01:26:39,819 --> 01:26:41,654
No, no, I think it'd be fine.

1157
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:42,739
Great.
Cool.

1158
01:26:44,198 --> 01:26:46,951
The thing that's gonna
make it more crowded...

1159
01:26:47,493 --> 01:26:49,579
Harriet.
You haven't met Harriet.

1160
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:51,539
There's a fourth one?
Yeah.

1161
01:26:51,622 --> 01:26:55,668
Don't worry, you're totally gonna
like her 'cause she is the sexy one.

1162
01:26:55,752 --> 01:26:58,588
Really? Wow.
Yeah.

1163
01:26:58,921 --> 01:27:00,965
Praise the Lord!

1164
01:27:01,049 --> 01:27:02,425
And he's a Christian.

1165
01:27:05,011 --> 01:27:06,679
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1166
01:27:27,617 --> 01:27:30,703
One present only each
tonight. Who's got one for Dad?

1167
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:32,705
I have.
Let Mommy go first.

1168
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:33,831
I'll get it. I'll get it.

1169
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:35,833
No, no, no. I want to choose
mine. I want to choose mine.

1170
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:38,127
I think I want

1171
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:41,422
this one.

1172
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:43,966
I have, of course, bought you
the traditional scarf as well,

1173
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:47,804
but this is my other,
slightly special, personal one.

1174
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:50,515
Thank you.

1175
01:27:51,015 --> 01:27:52,767
That's a real first.

1176
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:53,851
Rip it!

1177
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:54,936
What is it?

1178
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:58,022
I'm going to...
All right, I'll rip it.

1179
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:07,365
God, that's a surprise.

1180
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:09,659
What is it?

1181
01:28:11,869 --> 01:28:15,081
It's a CD.
Joni Mitchell. Wow.

1182
01:28:15,164 --> 01:28:17,750
To continue your
emotional education.

1183
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:21,963
Yes. Goodness.

1184
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,549
That's great.

1185
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:27,051
My brilliant wife.

1186
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:28,344
Yes.

1187
01:28:29,846 --> 01:28:34,183
Actually, do you mind if I just
absent myself for a second?

1188
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:36,853
All that ice cream.

1189
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:40,440
Darling, could you just make
sure the kids are ready to go?

1190
01:28:40,523 --> 01:28:41,941
I'll be back in a minute.

1191
01:28:42,024 --> 01:28:44,318
All right, all right,
let's take it easy.

1192
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:46,070
Mine first. Mine.

1193
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:45,064
Oh, my God.

1194
01:30:45,147 --> 01:30:48,067
It's a miracle.
You're all dressed.

1195
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:51,070
Come on, come on,
come on, we're horribly late.

1196
01:30:51,153 --> 01:30:53,155
Right, then. Come on.
In the car. In the car.

1197
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:54,574
Come on.

1198
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:06,168
Has she noticed you yet?

1199
01:31:06,252 --> 01:31:07,878
No.

1200
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:09,463
You know the thing
about romance is

1201
01:31:09,547 --> 01:31:12,216
people only get together
right at the very end.

1202
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,427
Of course.

1203
01:31:16,095 --> 01:31:19,682
By the way, I feel bad. I never
ask you how your love life is going.

1204
01:31:19,765 --> 01:31:21,100
Uh-huh.

1205
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:23,728
No.

1206
01:31:23,811 --> 01:31:26,647
As you know, that was
a done deal long ago.

1207
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:30,735
Unless, of course,
Claudia Schiffer calls,

1208
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:32,945
in which case I want you
out of the house straightaway,

1209
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:35,072
you wee motherless mongrel.

1210
01:31:36,282 --> 01:31:40,870
No, no. We'll want to have sex
in every room, including yours.

1211
01:31:41,078 --> 01:31:43,456
<i>It's a rainy
Christmas Eve all over the UK</i>

1212
01:31:43,539 --> 01:31:45,916
<i>and the big question
is who is number one</i>

1213
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,752
<i>on the Radio One
chart show tonight?</i>

1214
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:51,922
<i>Is it Blue or the unexpected
Christmas sensation from Billy Mack?</i>

1215
01:31:52,214 --> 01:31:56,010
<i>You might have guessed it,
although you may not believe it.</i>

1216
01:31:56,093 --> 01:31:58,262
<i>It's Billy Mack.</i>

1217
01:32:01,015 --> 01:32:02,850
You are the champion!

1218
01:32:02,933 --> 01:32:04,310
<i>Hi, Billy.</i>

1219
01:32:04,393 --> 01:32:05,394
Hello.

1220
01:32:05,478 --> 01:32:09,023
<i>We're live across the nation,
and you're number one.</i>

1221
01:32:09,106 --> 01:32:10,650
<i>How will you
be celebrating?</i>

1222
01:32:10,733 --> 01:32:11,984
I don't know.

1223
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:15,071
Either I could behave like
a real rock and roll loser

1224
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:18,157
and get drunk
with my fat manager,

1225
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:20,076
or, when I hang up,

1226
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:25,081
I'll be flooded by invitations to a
large number of glamorous parties.

1227
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:28,584
<i>Let's hope it's the latter. And here
it is. Number one, from Billy Mack,</i>

1228
01:32:28,668 --> 01:32:30,419
<i>it's</i> Christmas Is All Around.

1229
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:32,713
Jesus, not that crap again.

1230
01:32:36,258 --> 01:32:38,636
Bill, it's for you, babe.

1231
01:32:39,345 --> 01:32:41,722
Hello. Elton.

1232
01:32:41,847 --> 01:32:45,101
Of course. Of course.

1233
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:48,396
Send an embarrassingly
big car, and I'll be there.

1234
01:32:50,773 --> 01:32:54,276
It's gonna be
a very good Christmas.

1235
01:33:02,451 --> 01:33:03,494
Right.

1236
01:33:03,577 --> 01:33:06,330
I'd better be getting inside,
actually. My mom and, you know...

1237
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:09,208
Of course, yeah.
It's getting a bit cold.

1238
01:33:12,086 --> 01:33:13,587
Well, good night.

1239
01:33:13,671 --> 01:33:14,797
Night.

1240
01:33:24,682 --> 01:33:26,225
Okay.

1241
01:33:40,573 --> 01:33:44,368
All I want for Christmas
is you.

1242
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:49,248
Right.

1243
01:33:49,331 --> 01:33:52,334
Thank you. Good.

1244
01:33:52,835 --> 01:33:54,086
Good night.

1245
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:10,603
Look, everyone,
it's Uncle Jamie.

1246
01:34:10,686 --> 01:34:13,355
Hi, Uncle Jamie!

1247
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:17,526
Yes, splendid. It's
lovely to see you all.

1248
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:20,696
And...

1249
01:34:21,864 --> 01:34:23,407
I'm off, actually.

1250
01:34:23,657 --> 01:34:26,410
But, Jamie, darling...

1251
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:28,746
Sorry.

1252
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:31,373
Man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

1253
01:34:34,627 --> 01:34:36,295
I hate Uncle Jamie!

1254
01:34:36,378 --> 01:34:38,172
I hate Uncle Jamie.

1255
01:34:38,255 --> 01:34:39,882
I hate Uncle Jamie.

1256
01:34:51,185 --> 01:34:53,979
Gatwick Airport, please.
Fast as you can.

1257
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:10,204
Night, Sarah.

1258
01:35:10,287 --> 01:35:11,789
Night, Karl.

1259
01:35:12,832 --> 01:35:14,834
I...

1260
01:35:19,255 --> 01:35:22,424
Merry Christmas.

1261
01:35:42,278 --> 01:35:45,155
Hi, babe.
How's it going? Yeah.

1262
01:35:45,489 --> 01:35:47,783
Is it all party, party,
party down there?

1263
01:36:06,552 --> 01:36:08,512
Sam, time for dinner.

1264
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:09,847
I'm not hungry.

1265
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:13,267
Sam, I've done
chicken kebabs.

1266
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:15,436
Look at the sign
on the door.

1267
01:36:19,732 --> 01:36:20,983
Right.

1268
01:36:27,531 --> 01:36:30,159
It's a little long.

1269
01:36:38,417 --> 01:36:40,419
I'll get it.

1270
01:36:46,884 --> 01:36:48,302
Hi.

1271
01:36:48,385 --> 01:36:49,845
Who is it?

1272
01:36:54,516 --> 01:36:56,310
It's carol singers.

1273
01:36:56,518 --> 01:36:59,229
Give them a quid and
tell them to bugger off.

1274
01:38:11,427 --> 01:38:13,429
Merry Christmas.

1275
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:51,550
Enough.

1276
01:38:52,843 --> 01:38:54,344
Enough now.

1277
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:04,772
What the hell
are you doing here?

1278
01:39:04,855 --> 01:39:06,774
You're supposed to
be at Elton John's.

1279
01:39:06,857 --> 01:39:11,820
Well, I was there for a minute or
two, and then I had an epiphany.

1280
01:39:12,488 --> 01:39:14,656
Really?
Yeah.

1281
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:16,742
Come on. Just come up.

1282
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:20,079
So what was this epiphany?

1283
01:39:20,162 --> 01:39:22,790
It was about Christmas.

1284
01:39:23,457 --> 01:39:25,542
You realized
it was all around.

1285
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:28,504
No. I realized that
Christmas is the time

1286
01:39:28,587 --> 01:39:30,506
to be with
the people you love.

1287
01:39:31,465 --> 01:39:32,674
Right.

1288
01:39:32,758 --> 01:39:36,011
And I realized that,
as dire chance

1289
01:39:36,095 --> 01:39:39,264
and fateful cock-up
would have it,

1290
01:39:39,348 --> 01:39:43,185
here I am, mid-50s,

1291
01:39:43,727 --> 01:39:46,814
and without knowing it, I've gone
and spent most of my adult life

1292
01:39:46,897 --> 01:39:49,274
with a chubby employee.

1293
01:39:50,943 --> 01:39:53,529
And, much as it
grieves me to say it,

1294
01:39:53,612 --> 01:39:59,409
it might be that the
people I love is, in fact,

1295
01:40:00,619 --> 01:40:01,620
you.

1296
01:40:04,748 --> 01:40:06,750
Well, this is a surprise.

1297
01:40:07,084 --> 01:40:08,669
Yeah.

1298
01:40:08,752 --> 01:40:11,171
Ten minutes at Elton John's,
you're as gay as a Maypole.

1299
01:40:11,255 --> 01:40:13,090
No, look.
I'm serious here.

1300
01:40:13,173 --> 01:40:15,008
I left Elton's
where there were

1301
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:17,469
a hefty number of
half-naked chicks

1302
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:22,558
with their mouths open in order
to hang out with you at Christmas.

1303
01:40:24,726 --> 01:40:26,103
Well, Bill...

1304
01:40:26,186 --> 01:40:30,065
It's a terrible,
terrible mistake, chubs,

1305
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:37,531
but you turn out to be
the fucking love of my life.

1306
01:40:40,951 --> 01:40:44,663
And to be honest,
despite all my complaining,

1307
01:40:46,748 --> 01:40:49,126
we have had
a wonderful life.

1308
01:40:53,964 --> 01:40:55,632
Well,

1309
01:40:57,426 --> 01:40:59,136
thank you.

1310
01:41:01,054 --> 01:41:03,974
I mean, come on,
it's been an honor.

1311
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:08,270
I feel very proud.

1312
01:41:08,353 --> 01:41:10,439
Look, don't be a moron.

1313
01:41:21,575 --> 01:41:24,661
Come on, let's get
pissed and watch porn.

1314
01:41:44,181 --> 01:41:46,642
<i>Dear sir...
Dear David,</i>

1315
01:41:46,725 --> 01:41:50,020
<i>Merry Christmas and I hope
you have a very happy New Year.</i>

1316
01:41:50,312 --> 01:41:52,648
<i>I'm very sorry about
the thing that happened.</i>

1317
01:41:52,731 --> 01:41:55,776
<i>It was a very odd moment
and I feel like a prize idiot.</i>

1318
01:41:56,068 --> 01:41:57,778
<i>Particularly because,</i>

1319
01:41:57,861 --> 01:42:00,614
<i>if you can't say it at
Christmas when can you, eh,</i>

1320
01:42:00,697 --> 01:42:04,326
<i>I'm actually yours.
With love, your Natalie.</i>

1321
01:42:24,721 --> 01:42:26,598
Jack, yeah, I need a car.

1322
01:42:26,682 --> 01:42:28,892
Right now. Thank you.

1323
01:42:40,696 --> 01:42:42,739
Don't wait up.

1324
01:42:46,702 --> 01:42:48,662
I'd like to go to Wandsworth,
the dodgy end.

1325
01:42:48,745 --> 01:42:50,205
Very good, sir.

1326
01:43:01,925 --> 01:43:04,636
Harris Street.
What number, sir?

1327
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,431
God, it's the
longest street in the world,

1328
01:43:07,514 --> 01:43:09,391
and I have
absolutely no idea.

1329
01:43:17,983 --> 01:43:19,860
Hello.
Does Natalie live here?

1330
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:21,403
No.

1331
01:43:21,486 --> 01:43:23,322
Right, fine.
Thank you. Sorry to disturb.

1332
01:43:23,405 --> 01:43:25,449
Hey, aren't...

1333
01:43:25,782 --> 01:43:28,744
Aren't you
the prime minister?

1334
01:43:28,827 --> 01:43:32,122
Yes. In fact, I am.
Merry Christmas.

1335
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:34,875
Part of the service now.

1336
01:43:34,958 --> 01:43:37,044
Trying to get around to
everyone by New Year's Eve.

1337
01:43:42,758 --> 01:43:45,427
Hello.
Does Natalie live here?

1338
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:46,636
No, she doesn't.

1339
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:47,846
Oh, dear. Okay.

1340
01:43:47,929 --> 01:43:49,890
Are you singing carols?

1341
01:43:49,973 --> 01:43:51,141
No. No, I'm not.

1342
01:43:51,224 --> 01:43:52,976
Please, sir, please.

1343
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:54,353
Please.

1344
01:43:57,439 --> 01:43:59,191
Well, I suppose I could.

1345
01:43:59,608 --> 01:44:01,193
Please.

1346
01:44:02,444 --> 01:44:03,862
All right.

1347
01:44:06,823 --> 01:44:10,160
<i>Good King Wenceslas
looked out</i>

1348
01:44:10,243 --> 01:44:13,914
<i>On the feast of Stephen</i>

1349
01:44:13,997 --> 01:44:17,084
<i>When the snow
lay round about</i>

1350
01:44:17,459 --> 01:44:20,754
<i>Deep and crisp and even</i>

1351
01:44:20,837 --> 01:44:24,424
<i>Brightly shone
the moon that night</i>

1352
01:44:25,759 --> 01:44:28,970
Hello. Sorry to disturb.
Does Natalie live here?

1353
01:44:29,054 --> 01:44:31,306
No. She lives next door.

1354
01:44:35,018 --> 01:44:36,019
Ah!

1355
01:44:36,561 --> 01:44:37,896
Brilliant.

1356
01:44:37,979 --> 01:44:40,232
You're not who I think
you are, are you?

1357
01:44:40,315 --> 01:44:42,609
Yes, I'm afraid I am, and I'm
sorry about all the cock-ups.

1358
01:44:42,692 --> 01:44:44,778
Not my fault. My
cabinet are absolute crap.

1359
01:44:44,861 --> 01:44:48,407
We hope to do better next
year. Merry Christmas to you.

1360
01:45:04,798 --> 01:45:05,799
Ah!

1361
01:45:05,882 --> 01:45:09,261
Hello. Is Natalie in?

1362
01:45:09,344 --> 01:45:12,139
Where the fuck
is my fucking coat?

1363
01:45:13,723 --> 01:45:14,808
Oh!

1364
01:45:14,891 --> 01:45:17,894
Hello.

1365
01:45:17,978 --> 01:45:22,858
This is my mom and my dad and
my Uncle Tony and my Auntie Glynne.

1366
01:45:22,941 --> 01:45:24,776
Hello.
Very nice to meet you.

1367
01:45:25,235 --> 01:45:28,780
And this is
the prime minister.

1368
01:45:28,864 --> 01:45:31,867
Yes, we can see that,
darling.

1369
01:45:32,033 --> 01:45:34,494
And, unfortunately,
we're very late.

1370
01:45:34,578 --> 01:45:37,539
It's the school Christmas
concert, you see, David.

1371
01:45:37,831 --> 01:45:39,291
It's the first time
all the local schools

1372
01:45:39,374 --> 01:45:41,251
have joined together,
even St. Basil's...

1373
01:45:41,334 --> 01:45:42,586
Too much detail, Mom.

1374
01:45:42,669 --> 01:45:44,963
Anyway,
how can we help, sir?

1375
01:45:45,297 --> 01:45:49,050
Well, I just needed Natalie

1376
01:45:51,928 --> 01:45:53,889
on some state business.

1377
01:45:55,265 --> 01:46:00,395
Right, yes.
Of course. Right.

1378
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:03,023
Well, perhaps you should
come on later, Plumpy.

1379
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:04,774
Natalie.

1380
01:46:04,858 --> 01:46:07,152
Well, listen, I don't want to
make you late for the concert.

1381
01:46:07,235 --> 01:46:09,029
No, it's nothing, really.

1382
01:46:09,112 --> 01:46:10,572
Keith will be
very disappointed.

1383
01:46:10,655 --> 01:46:12,616
No, really,
it doesn't matter.

1384
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:14,910
The octopus costume's
taken me months.

1385
01:46:15,285 --> 01:46:17,204
Eight is a lot
of legs, David.

1386
01:46:17,370 --> 01:46:18,371
Hmm.

1387
01:46:21,249 --> 01:46:23,627
Well, listen,
why don't I give you a lift,

1388
01:46:23,710 --> 01:46:28,632
and then we can talk about this
state business business in the car?

1389
01:46:31,051 --> 01:46:32,052
Okay.

1390
01:46:32,135 --> 01:46:33,887
Lovely, yes.
Lovely.

1391
01:46:33,970 --> 01:46:35,055
Thank you.

1392
01:46:35,138 --> 01:46:36,932
Hold tight, everybody.

1393
01:46:43,939 --> 01:46:45,106
How far is this place?

1394
01:46:45,190 --> 01:46:46,566
Just round the corner.

1395
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:49,236
Right. Well...

1396
01:46:51,112 --> 01:46:53,281
I just wanted to say

1397
01:46:55,283 --> 01:46:57,327
thank you for
the Christmas card.

1398
01:46:57,744 --> 01:46:59,246
You're welcome.

1399
01:46:59,538 --> 01:47:01,581
Look, I'm so sorry
about that day.

1400
01:47:01,748 --> 01:47:03,458
I mean, I came into the room
and he slinked towards me

1401
01:47:03,542 --> 01:47:04,668
and there was a fire

1402
01:47:04,751 --> 01:47:06,336
and he's the President
of the United States

1403
01:47:06,419 --> 01:47:08,922
and nothing happened,
I promise.

1404
01:47:09,005 --> 01:47:12,008
And I just felt like
such a fool because

1405
01:47:12,509 --> 01:47:15,637
I think about you
all the time, actually.

1406
01:47:16,054 --> 01:47:17,138
And I think you're
the man I really...

1407
01:47:17,222 --> 01:47:19,266
We're here.

1408
01:47:19,349 --> 01:47:20,934
...love.
Oh, wow.

1409
01:47:21,059 --> 01:47:23,603
That really was
just round the corner.

1410
01:47:39,035 --> 01:47:40,996
Well, look, I...

1411
01:47:42,914 --> 01:47:45,125
I think I'd better
not come in, you know?

1412
01:47:46,167 --> 01:47:49,713
Last thing anyone wants is some sleazy
politician stealing the kids' thunder.

1413
01:47:49,796 --> 01:47:53,425
No, please come. It'll be great.

1414
01:47:53,967 --> 01:47:56,553
No, I'd...
I'd better not.

1415
01:47:57,429 --> 01:48:02,017
But I will be very sorry

1416
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:04,144
to drive away from you.

1417
01:48:05,895 --> 01:48:08,023
Just give me one second.

1418
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:25,123
John's been very mysterious.
Where did you two meet?

1419
01:48:31,463 --> 01:48:33,465
No!

1420
01:49:05,163 --> 01:49:07,832
Come on in. We can
watch from backstage.

1421
01:49:08,541 --> 01:49:10,669
Okay. Terry,
I won't be long.

1422
01:49:14,172 --> 01:49:17,175
Look, this has to be a
very secret visit, okay?

1423
01:49:17,258 --> 01:49:18,760
Don't worry.
This was my school.

1424
01:49:18,843 --> 01:49:20,845
I know my way around.
Come on.

1425
01:49:24,307 --> 01:49:27,060
Look, the sheep are ready
already and you're not even...

1426
01:49:27,143 --> 01:49:28,895
David.

1427
01:49:31,106 --> 01:49:33,358
How are you?

1428
01:49:33,733 --> 01:49:37,404
Hi, guys. Hey, hey, hey.
You all right?

1429
01:49:37,987 --> 01:49:40,115
What the hell
are you doing here?

1430
01:49:40,198 --> 01:49:41,199
Well, you know...

1431
01:49:41,282 --> 01:49:43,118
Well, I always tell your
secretary's secretary's secretary

1432
01:49:43,201 --> 01:49:46,037
that these things are going
on, but it never occurred to me

1433
01:49:46,121 --> 01:49:47,664
you'd actually turn up.

1434
01:49:47,747 --> 01:49:49,749
I thought it was
about time I did.

1435
01:49:49,833 --> 01:49:51,042
I just didn't
want anyone to see,

1436
01:49:51,126 --> 01:49:53,253
so I'm gonna hide myself
somewhere and watch the show.

1437
01:49:53,336 --> 01:49:55,964
Good luck, good luck, Daisy.
Good luck, Bernie.

1438
01:49:56,089 --> 01:49:59,592
I have to tell you, I've never been
gladder to see my stupid big brother.

1439
01:49:59,676 --> 01:50:00,844
Thank you.

1440
01:50:00,927 --> 01:50:02,220
All right.

1441
01:50:03,263 --> 01:50:05,849
Now, we haven't
been introduced.

1442
01:50:06,266 --> 01:50:09,144
Right. Well, this is Gavin.

1443
01:50:09,227 --> 01:50:10,270
Hello, Gavin.

1444
01:50:10,353 --> 01:50:11,479
My copper.

1445
01:50:11,563 --> 01:50:13,523
And this is Natalie,
who's my...

1446
01:50:13,732 --> 01:50:16,276
Who's my
catering manager.

1447
01:50:17,026 --> 01:50:18,778
Hi.
Catering manager.

1448
01:50:18,862 --> 01:50:21,030
Watch out he keeps
his hands off you.

1449
01:50:21,114 --> 01:50:22,824
Twenty years ago, you'd
have been just his type.

1450
01:50:22,907 --> 01:50:26,578
I'll be very careful. Don't try something,
sir, just because it's Christmas.

1451
01:50:28,163 --> 01:50:29,164
No, seriously.

1452
01:50:30,373 --> 01:50:33,710
Come on. Showtime. Quickly.
Look, see you after, yeah?

1453
01:50:33,793 --> 01:50:35,253
Yeah, probably. Yeah.

1454
01:50:35,336 --> 01:50:37,422
Thank you, Prime Minister.

1455
01:50:37,505 --> 01:50:38,548
It's all right.

1456
01:50:38,631 --> 01:50:40,091
Come on.
Right.

1457
01:50:40,175 --> 01:50:44,304
<i>Catch a falling
star and put it in your pocket</i>

1458
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:48,808
<i>Save it for a rainy day</i>

1459
01:50:48,892 --> 01:50:52,771
<i>Catch a falling star
and put it in your pocket</i>

1460
01:50:53,062 --> 01:50:56,357
<i>Never let it fade away</i>

1461
01:50:57,317 --> 01:51:01,237
<i>Never let it fade away</i>

1462
01:51:01,863 --> 01:51:06,785
<i>Never let it fade away</i>

1463
01:51:14,459 --> 01:51:16,044
<i>Hillier School would
now like to present</i>

1464
01:51:16,127 --> 01:51:18,004
<i>their chosen
Christmas number.</i>

1465
01:51:18,087 --> 01:51:21,090
<i>Lead vocals by 10-year-old
Joanna Anderson,</i>

1466
01:51:21,174 --> 01:51:25,970
<i>backing vocals coordinated by her
mother, the great Mrs. Jean Anderson.</i>

1467
01:51:26,387 --> 01:51:29,140
<i>Some of the staff have
decided to help out,</i>

1468
01:51:29,224 --> 01:51:33,520
<i>and for this,
we ask you to forgive us.</i>

1469
01:51:33,937 --> 01:51:35,480
<i>Thank you.</i>

1470
01:51:41,236 --> 01:51:45,114
<i>I don't want
a lot for Christmas</i>

1471
01:51:45,198 --> 01:51:49,244
<i>There's just one thing I need</i>

1472
01:51:49,327 --> 01:51:52,497
<i>I don't care
about the presents</i>

1473
01:51:52,872 --> 01:51:56,584
<i>Underneath
the Christmas tree</i>

1474
01:51:56,751 --> 01:52:00,255
<i>I just want you for my own</i>

1475
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:04,259
<i>More than you
could ever know</i>

1476
01:52:04,342 --> 01:52:08,096
<i>Make my wish come true</i>

1477
01:52:08,263 --> 01:52:12,225
<i>All I want for Christmas</i>

1478
01:52:12,600 --> 01:52:19,607
<i>Is you</i>

1479
01:52:22,443 --> 01:52:25,196
<i>I don't want
a lot for Christmas</i>

1480
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:28,449
<i>There's just
one thing I need</i>

1481
01:52:28,783 --> 01:52:31,494
<i>I don't care

1482
01:52:31,578 --> 01:52:34,622
<i>Underneath
the Christmas tree</i>

1483
01:52:34,747 --> 01:52:37,876
<i>I just want you for my own</i>

1484
01:52:37,959 --> 01:52:41,004
<i>More than you

1485
01:52:41,254 --> 01:52:44,215
<i>Make my wish come true</i>

1486
01:52:44,424 --> 01:52:48,928
<i>All I want for Christmas
is you</i>

1487
01:52:50,555 --> 01:52:53,266
<i>You, baby</i>

1488
01:52:53,349 --> 01:52:56,895
<i>All the lights are shining</i>

1489
01:52:56,978 --> 01:53:00,899
<i>So brightly everywhere</i>

1490
01:53:01,065 --> 01:53:05,194
<i>And the sound of
children's laughter fills the air</i>

1491
01:53:05,278 --> 01:53:07,238
<i>Laughter fills the air</i>

1492
01:53:07,322 --> 01:53:09,157
<i>Everyone is singing</i>

1493
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:10,241
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1494
01:53:10,325 --> 01:53:12,827
<i>I hear those
sleigh bells ringing</i>

1495
01:53:12,952 --> 01:53:15,538
<i>Santa,
won't you bring me my honey?</i>

1496
01:53:15,622 --> 01:53:19,167
<i>Won't you please
bring my baby to me?</i>

1497
01:53:19,250 --> 01:53:22,337
<i>I don't want
a lot for Christmas</i>

1498
01:53:22,420 --> 01:53:24,339
<i>This is all I'm asking for</i>

1499
01:53:24,422 --> 01:53:26,007
<i>All I'm asking for</i>

1500
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:28,801
<i>I just wanna see my baby</i>

1501
01:53:28,885 --> 01:53:31,888
<i>Standing right
outside my door</i>

1502
01:53:32,013 --> 01:53:34,557
<i>'Cause I just
want you for my own</i>

1503
01:53:35,266 --> 01:53:36,684
<i>More than you
could ever know</i>

1504
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:38,394
<i>You will ever know</i>

1505
01:53:38,478 --> 01:53:41,356
<i>Make my wish come true</i>

1506
01:53:41,439 --> 01:53:45,401
<i>All I want for Christmas</i>

1507
01:53:45,485 --> 01:53:49,155
<i>Is you</i>

1508
01:53:49,489 --> 01:53:51,699
<i>All I want for Christmas</i>

1509
01:53:51,950 --> 01:53:55,328
<i>And you and you</i>

1510
01:53:55,578 --> 01:53:56,829
<i>And you and you</i>

1511
01:53:56,913 --> 01:53:58,539
<i>All I want for Christmas</i>

1512
01:53:58,998 --> 01:54:02,377
<i>All I want for Christmas</i>

1513
01:54:19,102 --> 01:54:21,020
Right.

1514
01:54:24,315 --> 01:54:26,317
So, not quite as secret
as we'd hoped.

1515
01:54:26,401 --> 01:54:27,902
What do we do now?

1516
01:54:27,986 --> 01:54:29,028
Smile.

1517
01:54:29,696 --> 01:54:31,698
Little bow.

1518
01:54:35,201 --> 01:54:37,286
And a wave.

1519
01:54:50,967 --> 01:54:53,803
Absolutely no idea.
I mean, can you imagine?

1520
01:54:53,886 --> 01:54:55,888
I'll see you later,
all right?

1521
01:54:55,972 --> 01:54:58,057
I'll speak to you. Bye.

1522
01:55:00,893 --> 01:55:04,856
Tell me, if you were in my
position, what would you do?

1523
01:55:05,231 --> 01:55:07,150
What position is that?

1524
01:55:07,233 --> 01:55:11,029
Imagine your husband
bought a gold necklace

1525
01:55:11,112 --> 01:55:14,115
and, come Christmas,
gave it to somebody else.

1526
01:55:14,323 --> 01:55:15,324
Karen...

1527
01:55:15,408 --> 01:55:16,659
Would you wait around
to find out...

1528
01:55:16,743 --> 01:55:17,744
Good night.

1529
01:55:17,827 --> 01:55:19,454
Night, darling.
Happy Christmas.

1530
01:55:19,537 --> 01:55:22,540
Would you wait around to
find out if it's just a necklace

1531
01:55:22,623 --> 01:55:25,084
or if it's sex
and a necklace

1532
01:55:25,168 --> 01:55:28,504
or if, worst of all, it's
a necklace and love?

1533
01:55:30,339 --> 01:55:31,549
Would you stay?

1534
01:55:31,632 --> 01:55:34,510
Knowing life would
always be a little bit worse?

1535
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:36,471
Or would you cut and run?

1536
01:55:36,554 --> 01:55:38,765
Oh, God.

1537
01:55:43,603 --> 01:55:46,272
I am so in the wrong.

1538
01:55:46,439 --> 01:55:48,399
A classic fool.

1539
01:55:48,649 --> 01:55:51,694
Yes, but you've also
made a fool out of me.

1540
01:55:51,778 --> 01:55:54,530
You've made the
life I lead foolish, too.

1541
01:55:56,991 --> 01:55:59,827
Darling. Darlings!

1542
01:55:59,911 --> 01:56:03,372
You were wonderful.

1543
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:06,250
My little lobster,
you were so...

1544
01:56:06,334 --> 01:56:08,544
What is that word?

1545
01:56:08,711 --> 01:56:10,588
Orange.

1546
01:56:11,047 --> 01:56:14,008
Come on, I've got treats
at home. Dad's coming.

1547
01:56:15,551 --> 01:56:20,098
Sammy! Fantastic show!
Classic drumming, Son.

1548
01:56:20,473 --> 01:56:23,351
Thanks.
Plan didn't work, though.

1549
01:56:23,434 --> 01:56:24,435
Tell her, then.

1550
01:56:24,519 --> 01:56:26,604
Tell her what?
Tell her that you love her.

1551
01:56:26,687 --> 01:56:29,482
No way.
Anyway, they fly tonight.

1552
01:56:29,565 --> 01:56:33,027
Even better. Sam,
you've got nothing to lose,

1553
01:56:33,111 --> 01:56:35,613
and you'll always
regret it if you don't.

1554
01:56:36,739 --> 01:56:38,616
I never told
your mom enough.

1555
01:56:38,699 --> 01:56:40,118
I should have
told her every day,

1556
01:56:40,201 --> 01:56:42,995
because she was perfect
every day.

1557
01:56:44,413 --> 01:56:48,543
You've seen the films, kiddo.
It ain't over till it's over.

1558
01:56:50,753 --> 01:56:53,172
Okay, Dad. Let's do it.

1559
01:56:53,464 --> 01:56:55,508
Let's go get the shit
kicked out of us by love.

1560
01:56:55,591 --> 01:56:56,592
Yes.

1561
01:56:57,552 --> 01:56:58,761
Just give me one sec.

1562
01:56:58,845 --> 01:56:59,887
Yeah.

1563
01:57:01,347 --> 01:57:02,473
I'm sorry.

1564
01:57:02,557 --> 01:57:03,641
Sorry.

1565
01:57:04,684 --> 01:57:06,227
That's okay.

1566
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:07,645
My fault.

1567
01:57:07,728 --> 01:57:09,397
No, no, really, it wasn't.

1568
01:57:10,148 --> 01:57:12,024
You're Sam's dad, aren't you?

1569
01:57:13,151 --> 01:57:15,903
Yeah. Stepdad, actually.

1570
01:57:16,988 --> 01:57:18,990
Daniel.
I'm Carol.

1571
01:57:19,073 --> 01:57:20,783
Carol.

1572
01:57:21,033 --> 01:57:22,910
Okay, I'm back. Let's go.

1573
01:57:22,994 --> 01:57:25,496
Yeah. Well...

1574
01:57:26,581 --> 01:57:28,791
I hope we'll meet again,
Karen.

1575
01:57:29,083 --> 01:57:30,293
Carol.

1576
01:57:33,129 --> 01:57:34,922
I'll make sure we do.

1577
01:57:35,006 --> 01:57:36,924
Yeah? Good.

1578
01:57:45,641 --> 01:57:47,101
Tell her.
What?

1579
01:57:47,185 --> 01:57:48,644
You know...

1580
01:57:48,728 --> 01:57:50,646
Don't be such an arse.

1581
01:57:54,066 --> 01:57:56,068
Look, there she is.
Where?

1582
01:57:56,152 --> 01:57:57,653
Over there.

1583
01:58:00,281 --> 01:58:01,490
Oh, no.

1584
01:58:03,034 --> 01:58:06,078
It's okay, we'll go to the
airport. I know a shortcut.

1585
01:58:20,968 --> 01:58:22,470
Good evening.

1586
01:58:23,262 --> 01:58:24,263
Mr. Barros?

1587
01:58:24,347 --> 01:58:25,348
Yes.

1588
01:58:26,432 --> 01:58:29,018
I am here to ask your daughter...

1589
01:58:29,268 --> 01:58:31,729
...for her hands in marriage.

1590
01:58:32,271 --> 01:58:34,357
You want to marry my daughter?

1591
01:58:34,523 --> 01:58:35,608
Yes.

1592
01:58:36,609 --> 01:58:39,403
Come here. There is a man at the door.

1593
01:58:41,364 --> 01:58:42,949
He wants to marry you.

1594
01:58:43,366 --> 01:58:44,575
But I've never seen him before.

1595
01:58:44,951 --> 01:58:45,952
Who cares?

1596
01:58:46,327 --> 01:58:48,287
You're going to sell me
to a complete stranger?

1597
01:58:48,579 --> 01:58:50,414
Sell? Who said sell?

1598
01:58:50,498 --> 01:58:51,499
I'll pay him.

1599
01:58:51,666 --> 01:58:54,627
Pardon me. I'm meaning
your other daughter - Aurelia.

1600
01:58:56,045 --> 01:58:59,882
She's not here - she's at work.
I'll take you.

1601
01:59:00,174 --> 01:59:01,592
You ! Stay here.

1602
01:59:01,801 --> 01:59:04,220
As if I would. Stupid!

1603
01:59:08,015 --> 01:59:10,726
Father is about to sell Aurelia
as a slave to this Englishman.

1604
01:59:16,565 --> 01:59:18,567
Wait. Wait.

1605
01:59:21,779 --> 01:59:23,155
Oh, no.

1606
01:59:24,782 --> 01:59:26,409
You better not say "yes" Father.

1607
01:59:26,617 --> 01:59:29,287
Shut up, Miss Dunkin' Donut 2003.

1608
01:59:34,875 --> 01:59:36,168
Look,
we're not actually flying.

1609
01:59:36,252 --> 01:59:38,546
You can't come through
without a boarding pass.

1610
01:59:38,629 --> 01:59:42,925
Not even to let the boy say
goodbye to the love of his life?

1611
01:59:44,677 --> 01:59:45,761
No.

1612
01:59:48,806 --> 01:59:50,933
I'm sorry, Sam.
Boarding pass, sir?

1613
01:59:52,143 --> 01:59:53,728
Just a moment, I know
I've got it here somewhere.

1614
01:59:53,811 --> 01:59:55,855
Sorry. Would you
mind hanging on to that?

1615
01:59:55,938 --> 01:59:57,690
Unless...
What?

1616
01:59:57,773 --> 01:59:59,066
Do you want to
make a run for it?

1617
01:59:59,150 --> 02:00:00,526
Hold on to that, as well.

1618
02:00:00,609 --> 02:00:01,819
You think I should?
Yeah.

1619
02:00:01,902 --> 02:00:03,529
Thank you. Hold those.

1620
02:00:03,612 --> 02:00:05,656
Okay.

1621
02:00:05,740 --> 02:00:06,741
Yes!

1622
02:00:06,824 --> 02:00:09,827
No, I must have left them where
I was having a cup of coffee.

1623
02:00:09,910 --> 02:00:11,245
I'm sorry.

1624
02:01:23,526 --> 02:01:25,736
Apparently he is going to kill Aurelia.

1625
02:01:26,404 --> 02:01:27,405
Cool!

1626
02:02:03,232 --> 02:02:05,234
Joanna.

1627
02:02:06,318 --> 02:02:08,320
Sam?

1628
02:02:11,615 --> 02:02:13,409
I thought you
didn't know my name.

1629
02:02:13,492 --> 02:02:14,743
Course I do.

1630
02:02:16,036 --> 02:02:19,582
Oh, Jesus.
Here, I've gotta run.

1631
02:03:11,759 --> 02:03:12,760
Where is Aurelia?

1632
02:03:13,052 --> 02:03:14,053
Why should I tell you?

1633
02:03:14,136 --> 02:03:15,638
This man wants to marry her.

1634
02:03:16,805 --> 02:03:20,226
He can't do that -
she's our best waitress.

1635
02:03:37,618 --> 02:03:39,370
Good evening, Aurelia.

1636
02:03:41,413 --> 02:03:43,415
Good evening, Jamie.

1637
02:03:58,681 --> 02:04:00,307
Beautiful Aurelia -

1638
02:04:01,475 --> 02:04:05,479
I've come here with a view to asking you

1639
02:04:07,314 --> 02:04:09,692
to marriage me.

1640
02:04:10,859 --> 02:04:16,156
I know I seems an insane person
because I hardly knows you

1641
02:04:16,865 --> 02:04:25,457
but sometimes things are so transparency

1642
02:04:26,458 --> 02:04:29,044
they don't need evidential proof.

1643
02:04:31,088 --> 02:04:36,176
And I will inhabit here,
or you can inhabit with me in England.

1644
02:04:36,885 --> 02:04:38,679
Definitely go for England, girl.

1645
02:04:38,929 --> 02:04:42,349
You'll meet Prince William -
then you can marry him instead.

1646
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:49,481
Of course I don't expecting you
to be as foolish as me...

1647
02:04:50,608 --> 02:04:54,278
and of course I prediction you say "no"

1648
02:04:56,447 --> 02:04:58,574
but it's Christmas

1649
02:04:59,950 --> 02:05:04,246
and I just wanted to check.

1650
02:05:08,626 --> 02:05:12,046
Oh, God - say yes, you skinny moron.

1651
02:05:15,424 --> 02:05:17,426
Thank you.

1652
02:05:19,386 --> 02:05:21,388
That will be nice.

1653
02:05:23,515 --> 02:05:26,185
Yes is being my answer.

1654
02:05:28,604 --> 02:05:30,272
Easy question.

1655
02:05:30,272 --> 02:05:31,649
What did you say?

1656
02:05:32,441 --> 02:05:34,026
Yes, of course.

1657
02:05:36,945 --> 02:05:38,197
Bravo!

1658
02:06:04,848 --> 02:06:06,934
You learned English?

1659
02:06:07,351 --> 02:06:09,478
Just in cases.

1660
02:06:51,061 --> 02:06:52,396
Hello, Daisy.

1661
02:06:52,479 --> 02:06:54,189
This one's Greta.

1662
02:06:54,273 --> 02:06:55,274
Hello, Greta.

1663
02:06:57,276 --> 02:07:01,363
Here she is. This is Aurelia.
This is Juliet. This is Peter.

1664
02:07:01,488 --> 02:07:03,198
Mark, hi,
didn't see you there.

1665
02:07:03,282 --> 02:07:04,533
Yeah, just thought
I'd tag along.

1666
02:07:04,616 --> 02:07:07,411
Jamie's friends
are so good-looking.

1667
02:07:07,786 --> 02:07:09,955
He never tells me this.

1668
02:07:10,205 --> 02:07:13,083
I think maybe now I have
made the wrong choice,

1669
02:07:13,167 --> 02:07:14,960
picked wrong Englishman.

1670
02:07:15,043 --> 02:07:16,086
She can't speak
English properly.

1671
02:07:16,170 --> 02:07:18,088
She doesn't know
what she's saying.

1672
02:07:18,172 --> 02:07:20,257
Dad! Dad!

1673
02:07:22,259 --> 02:07:24,011
Oh, God.

1674
02:07:24,386 --> 02:07:25,387
Did you get us any presents?

1675
02:07:25,471 --> 02:07:27,389
As a matter of fact, I did.

1676
02:07:27,473 --> 02:07:29,099
Thanks, Dad.

1677
02:07:32,811 --> 02:07:33,979
How are you?

1678
02:07:34,062 --> 02:07:35,814
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1679
02:07:37,691 --> 02:07:39,651
Good to have you back.

1680
02:07:39,735 --> 02:07:42,070
Come on. Home.

1681
02:07:45,032 --> 02:07:47,034
There she is.

1682
02:07:48,535 --> 02:07:51,121
Hi.

1683
02:07:51,205 --> 02:07:52,372
Hello.

1684
02:07:52,456 --> 02:07:54,708
He should have kissed her.

1685
02:07:54,792 --> 02:07:56,335
No, that's cool.

1686
02:07:58,378 --> 02:08:00,923
Hey. What are
you two doing here?

1687
02:08:01,924 --> 02:08:03,175
I might get a shag at last.

1688
02:08:03,258 --> 02:08:04,510
Naughty.

1689
02:08:04,593 --> 02:08:05,594
Got to go.

1690
02:08:05,677 --> 02:08:07,012
Bye.

1691
02:08:12,726 --> 02:08:15,437
Now, this is Harriet.

1692
02:08:16,563 --> 02:08:19,566
Hi.
Really pleased to meet you.

1693
02:08:19,650 --> 02:08:21,193
Hello, Harriet.

1694
02:08:21,276 --> 02:08:25,280
I hope you don't mind, I sort
of brought my sister to stay.

1695
02:08:26,782 --> 02:08:31,245
This is Carla.
She's real friendly.

1696
02:08:31,829 --> 02:08:34,081
Hello, you must be Tony.

1697
02:08:35,374 --> 02:08:37,376
I heard you were gorgeous.

1698
02:08:50,013 --> 02:08:51,098
God, you weigh a lot.

1699
02:08:51,181 --> 02:08:52,391
Shut your face.
