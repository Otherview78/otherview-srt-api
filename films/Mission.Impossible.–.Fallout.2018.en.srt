1
00:00:40,163 --> 00:00:44,202
Minister: Do you, Ethan, take Julia
to be your lawful wedded wife?

2
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:45,293
I do.

3
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:50,246
To have, to hold,
to love, Cherish, honor, and protect?

4
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,796
I do.

5
00:00:51,883 --> 00:00:56,001
Minister: To shield from terrors known
and unknown?

6
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:59,179
- To lie, to deceive...
“what?

7
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:03,259
To live a double life,
to fail to prevent her abduction,

8
00:01:03,353 --> 00:01:06,971
erase her identity,
force her into hiding,

9
00:01:07,065 --> 00:01:08,521
take away all she has known...

10
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:09,609
Stop.

11
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:11,254
In a selfish, futile,
fleeting attempt...

12
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:12,358
Stop.

13
00:01:12,446 --> 00:01:14,983
to escape your own true self?

14
00:01:15,073 --> 00:01:16,108
Please, stop.

15
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:18,531
And, Julia, do you choose to accept?

16
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:19,619
Don't.

17
00:01:19,953 --> 00:01:22,160
- I do.
- No.

18
00:01:23,915 --> 00:01:25,746
You should have killed me, Ethan.

19
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:27,415
(Explosion in distance)

20
00:01:32,674 --> 00:01:33,709
(Sighs)

21
00:01:37,929 --> 00:01:39,089
(Knock at door)

22
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:44,515
(Thunder rumbling)

23
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:46,767
(Knocking continues)

24
00:01:54,488 --> 00:01:56,820
Fate whispers to the warrior...

25
00:01:57,574 --> 00:01:59,314
Ethan: A storm is coming.

26
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,651
Deliveryman:
And the warrior whispers back...

27
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,661
I am the storm.

28
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,823
(Thunder rumbling)

29
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:34,733
(Device beeping)

30
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:41,898
Man: (On speaker)
Good evening, Mr. hunt.

31
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:44,200
The anarchist Solomon Lane.

32
00:02:44,454 --> 00:02:46,240
Since you captured him 2 years ago,

33
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:50,415
his absence from the world stage
has had unintended consequences.

34
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:52,163
His syndicate of rogue covert operatives

35
00:02:52,254 --> 00:02:54,996
continues to wreak havoc
around the globe.

36
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,955
The CIA's special activities division

37
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,167
has relentlessly hunted Lane's
elite network of hosliles.

38
00:03:00,262 --> 00:03:02,594
But many remain unknown and at large.

39
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:04,804
The remnants of this
extremist splinter cell

40
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:07,303
refer to themselves as "the apostles.”

41
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:11,470
they have since adopted
a policy of terror-for-hire,

42
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:13,806
making them an even greater threat.

43
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,232
They are responsible for
the recent smallpox outbreak

44
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,650
in Indian-controlled kashmir,

45
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:20,024
along the borders of China and Pakistan,

46
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:22,481
threatening one-third
of the world’s population.

47
00:03:22,576 --> 00:03:24,567
The epidemic is being contained,

48
00:03:24,661 --> 00:03:26,117
but intelligence would indicate

49
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:30,573
that a new client has hired the apostles
for a more ambitious operation.

50
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,407
They have been contacted by this man,

51
00:03:32,502 --> 00:03:36,211
an unidentified extremist
known only by the code name John lark,

52
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:38,380
author of this apocalyptic manifesto

53
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:41,880
calling for the destruction
of the current world order.

54
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,757
It is believed lark is responsible
for the disappearance

55
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:48,011
of Norwegian nuclear weapons
specialist nils delbruuk.

56
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:50,183
Dr. delbruuk's security
clearance was revoked

57
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,182
after he expressed
fiercely anti-religious views.

58
00:03:53,273 --> 00:03:55,264
Meanwhile, the apostles
have been in contact

59
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:57,599
with elements of
the eastern European underworld,

60
00:03:57,694 --> 00:04:00,060
who are in possession
of three plutonium cores

61
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:02,897
stolen from a missile base
in eastern Russia.

62
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:05,816
This would indicate that
John lark and the apostles

63
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:09,745
are working together
to acquire functioning nuclear weapons.

64
00:04:10,248 --> 00:04:12,614
Nest estimates that a man
with delbruuk’'s knowledge,

65
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:13,994
using the materials in play,

66
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:18,454
could complete three nuclear weapons
in as little as 72 hours.

67
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:20,254
These devices would be man-portable

68
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:22,833
and deployable anywhere
on earth overnight.

69
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:25,419
In the hands of John lark
and the apostles,

70
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:27,800
these weapons represent
an unprecedented threat

71
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:29,597
to countless millions.

72
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:32,387
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

73
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,061
is to prevent the apostles
from acquiring plutonium

74
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:37,639
using any means at your disposal.

75
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:41,481
If you or any members of your imf team
are caught or killed,

76
00:04:41,571 --> 00:04:44,608
the secretary will disavow
any knowledge of your actions.

77
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:45,779
Good luck, Ethan.

78
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:48,984
This message will
self-destruct in five seconds.

79
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:51,949
(Rain pattering)

80
00:04:52,499 --> 00:04:53,579
(Sizzles)

81
00:05:04,135 --> 00:05:05,466
He's late.

82
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:08,587
- He's never late.
- He'll be here.

83
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:10,047
I don't like it.

84
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:13,717
Something about this guy
just really gives me the creeps.

85
00:05:13,812 --> 00:05:15,803
Okay, just relax.

86
00:05:15,897 --> 00:05:17,228
I'm relaxed.

87
00:05:17,315 --> 00:05:18,395
You don't sound relaxed.

88
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:19,877
Luther, does he sound relaxed to you?

89
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:21,857
(Chuckles) He sounds terrified.

90
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:24,549
Benji: Please, I'm not terrified.
I just have a bad feeling is all.

91
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:26,313
Luther: / thought you said
you were relaxed.

92
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:29,900
It's entirely possible to be relaxed
and extremely uneasy at the same time.

93
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:31,826
- No, it's not.
You do it all the time.

94
00:05:31,913 --> 00:05:33,494
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

95
00:05:33,582 --> 00:05:34,697
No, he doesn't.

96
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,727
I'm supposed to believe that
you are perfectly relaxed,

97
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:38,161
- right here, now...
- Beniji.

98
00:05:38,253 --> 00:05:39,397
In a dark alleyway, waiting to buy

99
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:41,582
black-market plutonium
from a psychopath.

100
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:43,334
Benji, I won't let anything
happen to you.

101
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:44,835
- (Scoffs) Okay.
Luther: See, Benji,

102
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:46,257
you're perfectly safe.

103
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:48,209
That's easy for you to say,
you're in the Van.

104
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:50,116
Well, you wanted to be
in the field, tough guy.

105
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,176
And tonight, Luther,
I would like to be in the Van!

106
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:53,867
- (Tires squeal in distance)
- He's here.

107
00:05:53,894 --> 00:05:55,430
Oh, god. (Clears throat)

108
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:03,983
(Car doors opening)

109
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,820
(Car doors close)

110
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:12,158
Ethan: Have that money ready, Luther.

111
00:06:12,412 --> 00:06:13,492
Luther: Copy.

112
00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:19,582
Ethan, do you copy?

113
00:06:19,753 --> 00:06:21,243
Do you copy?

114
00:06:22,923 --> 00:06:23,958
(Gasps)

115
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,182
Are we finally gonna
do this or not?

116
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:46,359
I have survived in this business
with the help of a voice in my head.

117
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:51,523
This voice is never wrong.
And whenever I meet you,

118
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,821
it tells me the same thing.

119
00:06:54,871 --> 00:06:55,871
What's that?

120
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,121
Nothing.

121
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:06,667
I'm here to do business.
Tell the voice to flip a coin.

122
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,575
(Device beeping)

123
00:07:35,704 --> 00:07:37,194
(Device trilling)

124
00:07:38,373 --> 00:07:39,453
What's that?

125
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,824
This is a beryllium rod,
which is causing

126
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:44,830
a reaction with the plutonium
inside the core.

127
00:07:45,463 --> 00:07:46,578
(Continues trilling)

128
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:55,053
That's them.

129
00:07:57,976 --> 00:07:59,056
The money?

130
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:01,726
The money.

131
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:05,897
Bring the money.

132
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,070
Luther, bring the money.

133
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:30,748
We're gonna need
that money, Luther.

134
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:32,669
Kill them.

135
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:34,092
(Gunshots)

136
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:36,135
- (Shoutys)
(Gunshots)

137
00:08:37,932 --> 00:08:39,263
I got it!

138
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:44,511
Luther, do you copy?

139
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:45,731
Luther!

140
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:47,230
Luther, come in.

141
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,140
Man: Luther's not here right now.

142
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:52,568
What can the apostles
do for you, hunt?

143
00:08:52,655 --> 00:08:54,941
- What do you want?
- You're boxed in, hunt.

144
00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:58,529
Give us the plutonium
and walk away.

145
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,656
Benji, get the car.

146
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:02,328
- L don't think I can do that.
- Beniji.

147
00:09:02,415 --> 00:09:04,121
Get the car.

148
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:09,494
(Car engine starts)

149
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:13,251
(Gun firing)

150
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,430
(Grunts)

151
00:09:24,437 --> 00:09:26,348
Man: We'll make you a deal, hunt.

152
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:30,273
Give us the plutonium
and we won't kill your friend.

153
00:09:33,488 --> 00:09:35,774
Don't you do it, Ethan! Not for me!

154
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:50,497
- (Panting)
- Man: I'm gonna count to three.

155
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:52,381
One.

156
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:55,795
- Two.
- Luther...

157
00:09:56,636 --> 00:09:57,967
- 'M sorry.
- Three.

158
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,225
(Groans softly)

159
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:13,065
(Breathing heavily)

160
00:10:13,236 --> 00:10:15,443
I'm sorry.
I didn't know what else to do.

161
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,895
(Strained) We're good.

162
00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:20,489
(Coughing)

163
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:22,613
- You okay?
- I should be dead.

164
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:24,615
We should all be dead.

165
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:27,947
Why aren't we?

166
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:29,991
Where's the plutonium?

167
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:43,638
It's gone.

168
00:10:48,062 --> 00:10:49,540
Wolf blitzer: (On TV)
If you're just joining us,

169
00:10:49,564 --> 00:10:53,853
three massive explosions
have gone off simultaneously

170
00:10:56,654 --> 00:10:59,817
this image is live in Rome,
looking toward the Vatican

171
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:02,240
and is as close as our cameras can get.

172
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:05,444
It is believed that
the pope was in residence

173
00:11:05,538 --> 00:11:06,778
at the time of the blast.

174
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:10,957
Also live, we're looking at Jerusalem
from just outside the city.

175
00:11:11,044 --> 00:11:13,330
Also live, the holy city of mecca

176
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:15,958
from the USS Ronald Reagan
in the red sea

177
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:18,165
off the coast of Saudi Arabia.

178
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:20,250
Radiation has been detected,

179
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:23,382
indicating that
nuclear weapons were used

180
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:25,259
in these unspeakable attacks.

181
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,511
Luther: Ethan, it's time.

182
00:11:27,602 --> 00:11:29,038
No word on casualties yet,
but we can assume

183
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:30,723
the death toll is catastrophic.

184
00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:33,138
Early reports suggest
the weapons used

185
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:35,724
would require
highly specialized knowledge

186
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:37,433
that very few people possess.

187
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:42,693
The question now is who would attack
all three of these holy sites? And why?

188
00:11:43,117 --> 00:11:46,200
The attacks occurred
at precisely the same moment,

189
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:47,447
just over an hour ago,

190
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:49,362
at 4:00 A.M. eastern time.

191
00:11:49,457 --> 00:11:51,018
- Within minutes of the attack...
- (Chuckling)

192
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:53,408
Congress ordered
an emergency recess

193
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:55,164
and the capitol building
was evacuated.

194
00:11:55,255 --> 00:11:58,042
The president left Washington
on air force one.

195
00:11:58,132 --> 00:12:00,418
The white house has declared
a state of emergency,

196
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,796
placing the military on highest alert.

197
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:05,003
Would you excuse us, please?

198
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:08,301
Dr. delbruuk.

199
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:09,924
(Machine beeping)

200
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:11,346
Ethan: We know who you are.

201
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:14,224
We read the manifesto,
we found your lab.

202
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:17,394
(Sniffles)

203
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,601
(Indistinct announcement
on pa)

204
00:12:24,784 --> 00:12:26,115
"There has never been peace

205
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:28,193
"without first a great suffering.

206
00:12:28,288 --> 00:12:30,654
"The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace."

207
00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:33,076
See, this will unite them, hmm?

208
00:12:34,502 --> 00:12:36,834
When they read this manifesto,
they'll all understand.

209
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:39,628
Nobody's gonna read
that manifesto, ever.

210
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:41,581
I can promise you that.

211
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:43,007
Delbruuk: What day is it?

212
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:44,667
How long have I been here?

213
00:12:44,846 --> 00:12:46,382
What's the last thing you remember?

214
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:49,514
(Stammers) I was driving.

215
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,519
Someone hit me.

216
00:12:52,603 --> 00:12:54,264
That was two weeks ago.

217
00:12:55,064 --> 00:12:56,270
- Two weeks?
- Two weeks.

218
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:58,188
Luther: This is yours, isn't it?

219
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:00,684
It's how lark communicated with you.

220
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:03,235
- (Sniffles) Lark?
- Ethan: John lark.

221
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:05,564
- We know all about him.
- You know nothing.

222
00:13:05,658 --> 00:13:08,338
Luther: There's information in this
phone that could lead us to him.

223
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:10,075
And you have the passcode.

224
00:13:10,163 --> 00:13:12,449
You think lark is the enemy, hmm?

225
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,872
But you,

226
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,996
well, whoever you are,
you are the enemy.

227
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:19,668
You're why the system survives.

228
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:22,709
- Why the suffering goes on.
- Shut up!

229
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,212
We don't care about you.
We want lark.

230
00:13:25,303 --> 00:13:26,543
What if we make a deal?

231
00:13:26,637 --> 00:13:28,037
Ethan: No, there's no deal, Luther.

232
00:13:28,556 --> 00:13:29,966
Step outside.

233
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,386
Give me five minutes with this guy.

234
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:34,968
Ethan, I can't let you do that.
That's not who we are.

235
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:37,600
Then maybe we need to reconsider that.

236
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,022
What if they read
the manifesto on the air?

237
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:41,109
What? You can do that?

238
00:13:41,194 --> 00:13:42,775
We can do it with a phone call.

239
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,691
Delbruuk: Well, if he reads
lark's manifesto...

240
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:47,783
No.

241
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:49,573
(Laughing) I'll give you the passcode.

242
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:51,651
Luther: Ethan! Ethan!

243
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:53,449
(Laughing)
- Think, Ethan.

244
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:55,325
Think of the greater good, please.

245
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,198
Yeah, you do that.

250
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:11,973
Ethan: Sir.

251
00:14:12,558 --> 00:14:14,219
No, he won't cooperate.

252
00:14:15,103 --> 00:14:18,061
Yes, sir. If we read the manifesto

253
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,600
on the air.

254
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,600
I'm sorry, sir.

255
00:14:26,155 --> 00:14:27,361

Wolf blitzer: (On TV)
Trading and global markets plummeted.

257
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:39,704
Stand by. I'm told we're about
fo get some additional information.

258
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:44,291
I've just been handed a document
from nils delbruuk,

259
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:46,338
a nuclear weapons specialist

260
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:49,463
who claims to have built the weapons
used in these attacks.

261
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:53,680
I've been asked to read
this manifesto in its entirety.

262
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,760
"There has never been peace

263
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:57,513
"without first a great suffering.

264
00:14:57,854 --> 00:14:59,845
"The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace.

"As mankind is drawn
to his self-destruction

267
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:05,808
"like a moth to the candle,

268

"the so-called defenders of peace,

"the church, the government, the law,

00:15:10,783 --> 00:15:13,775
"work tirelessly
to save humanity from itself.”

271
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,406
it's not gonna help you now.

272
00:15:15,496 --> 00:15:17,282
"But by averting disaster,

273
00:15:17,373 --> 00:15:18,988
"they serve to delay a peace...”

274
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,289
what's done is done.

275
00:15:20,376 --> 00:15:23,459
"That can only come through
an inevitable baptism of fire.

276
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:26,754
"The suffering I bring you
is not the beginning of the end.

277
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:27,921
"It is the beginning

"of a greater mutual understanding...”

279

Wolf blitzer: “it is the first step

"toward the ultimate
brotherhood of man.”

282
00:15:34,682 --> 00:15:35,797
we got it.

283
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:37,382
"The suffering I bring you

284
00:15:37,477 --> 00:15:39,013
"is the bridge to ultimate peace."

Did we get it?

289
00:15:56,162 --> 00:15:57,743
Of course we got it.

290
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:07,503
I told you we'd get it.

291
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:09,918
I... I don't understand.

292
00:16:10,218 --> 00:16:12,174
The attacks didn't happen?

293
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:15,970
The car accident you were in,
that was an hour ago.

294
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:17,843
I was driving the other car.

295
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:20,099
Ethan: What's done is done,

296
00:16:20,186 --> 00:16:21,926
when we say it's done.

297
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:25,138
(Mission: Impossible theme playing)

298
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:37,053
Sir.

299
00:17:37,638 --> 00:17:40,175
That phone you unlocked led us
to a server in Iceland

300
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:42,131
where we managed to
decrypt a communiqué

301
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:44,808
between John lark
and this woman:

302
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:47,352
Alana mitsopolis,
activist and philanthropist,

303
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,555
whose charity work

304
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:50,085
has earned her
the nickname the white widow.

305
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:53,727
It's all a front for her real trade:
Arms dealing, money laundering.

306
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:56,358
Extensive political connections
provide her with protection.

307
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:57,884
Lark and the widow
are meeting tonight

308
00:17:57,908 --> 00:18:00,991
to negotiate delivery
of an unspecified package,

309
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:03,945
which we can only assume
is our missing plutonium.

310
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,032
They'll make contact in a private lounge
at the grand palais in Paris

311
00:18:07,126 --> 00:18:08,616
during her annual
fundraising event.

312
00:18:08,711 --> 00:18:09,917
The details are in the file.

313
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:11,231
If lark isn't there by midnight,

314
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:13,211
the widow will leave

315
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:14,979
and sell the package
to the highest bidder.

316
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:18,547
Which gives you
two hours from now to find lark.

317
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:20,970
Sir, I think there's something
you need to know.

318
00:18:21,057 --> 00:18:22,672
I'm gonna stop you right there.

319
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:25,509
You had a terrible choice
to make in Berlin:

320
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:27,309
Recover the plutonium or save your team.

321
00:18:27,396 --> 00:18:29,356
You chose your team,
and now the world is at risk.

322
00:18:30,524 --> 00:18:33,186
Some flaw deep in your core being

323
00:18:33,277 --> 00:18:36,690
simply won't allow you to choose
between one life and millions.

324
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:38,396
You see that as a sign of weakness.

325
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:41,107
To me, that's your greatest strength.

326
00:18:41,202 --> 00:18:43,944
It also tells me I can count on you
to cover my ass.

327
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:45,474
Because coming over here from the CIA

328
00:18:45,498 --> 00:18:47,204
was a lateral move,
some say a step down.

329
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,701
But l did it

330
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:50,703
because of you.

331
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:52,869
Don't make me regret it.

332
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:06,473
Make the call.

333
00:19:10,022 --> 00:19:11,432
Walker: Shut 'em down.

334
00:19:11,982 --> 00:19:13,392
(Plane engines power down)

335
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:23,428
What do you think you're doing, Erika?

336
00:19:23,452 --> 00:19:24,942
It may be your mission,

337
00:19:25,037 --> 00:19:27,119
but this is the CIA's plane.

338
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:28,912
It doesn't take off without my say-so.

339
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:30,239
We don't have time for this.

340
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:32,199
I have a team in Paris
ready to grab lark

341
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:33,830
as soon as he leaves the palais.

342
00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:36,788
A g5 standing by
to rendition him to gitmo,

343
00:19:36,882 --> 00:19:38,082
where a waterboard is waiting.

344
00:19:38,134 --> 00:19:41,626
Spend 24 hours we don't have
to pull a confession we can't trust

345
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:44,884
from a man we haven't
positively identified? No.

346
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:47,636
We need reliable intelligence,
and we need it now.

347
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:50,389
This scenario is precisely
why the imf exists!

348
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:52,845
The imf is Halloween, Alan.

349
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,649
A bunch of grown men in rubber masks
playing trick-or-treat.

350
00:19:56,736 --> 00:19:59,193
And if he had held on to
the plutonium in Berlin,

351
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,316
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

352
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,759
Hunley: And his team would be dead.

353
00:20:02,783 --> 00:20:04,739
Yes. They would.

354
00:20:04,827 --> 00:20:06,158
That's the job.

355
00:20:06,245 --> 00:20:09,737
And that's why I want
one of my own men on the scene

356
00:20:09,832 --> 00:20:11,868
to appraise the situation.

357
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:14,534
Agent Walker,
special activities.

358
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:17,040
His reputation precedes.

359
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:18,837
Sloane: You use a scalpel.

360
00:20:19,675 --> 00:20:21,506
I prefer a hammer.

361
00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:22,754
Hunley: The answer is no.

362
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:25,552
I have operational authority here,
direct from the president.

363
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:26,908
You have a problem with that,
you take it up with him.

364
00:20:26,932 --> 00:20:30,516
I have already, and he agrees
with me. My man goes

365
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:32,639
or no one goes.

366
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:42,687
No one comes between
you and that plutonium.

367
00:20:42,782 --> 00:20:45,819
Not hunt, not his team, not anyone.

368
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:07,174
Ethan: The white widow has spies
at every level of government.

369
00:21:07,515 --> 00:21:09,676
This plane is posing
as a commercial airliner

370
00:21:09,767 --> 00:21:11,928
so we can jump into France undetected.

371
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:15,095
The widow's meeting lark
in the vip lounge at midnight.

372
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:18,181
No one will be admitted without
a pre-issued electronic I.D. Band.

373
00:21:18,734 --> 00:21:20,645
We have acquired
the unique rfid number

374
00:21:20,736 --> 00:21:22,727
for lark's band,
allowing us to locate it

375
00:21:23,447 --> 00:21:24,778
with these.

376
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:27,356
Find that I.D. Band, you find lark.

377
00:21:28,202 --> 00:21:29,533
Then what?

378
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:33,530
- Then...
- (Device humming)

379
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,826
I assume his identity
and make contact with the widow.

380
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,330
She takes us to the package.

381
00:21:40,089 --> 00:21:42,501
People actually fall for this shit?

382
00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:45,833
How do you intend
to make lark cooperate?

383
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,591
I bump him in the crowd.

384
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:52,673
In ten seconds he'll look like
any other drunk at the party,

385
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,599
incoherent and completely pliable.

386
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,226
After I borrow his face,

387
00:21:56,313 --> 00:21:59,193
you walk him out the front door and
hand him to Sloane's extraction team.

388
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:01,266
You're not getting rid of me
that easily, hunt.

389
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,021
That's not what this is about.

390
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:04,818
Sure itis.

391
00:22:04,905 --> 00:22:07,692
I know you don't want me
on this detail.

392
00:22:07,783 --> 00:22:09,364
But let's face it:

393
00:22:09,451 --> 00:22:11,282
If you'd made
the hard choice in Berlin,

394
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,780
I wouldn't be here.

395
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:14,203
And if you hadn't gunned down

396
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,372
every syndicate agent
they sent you to find,

397
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:17,998
I wouldn't be here.

398
00:22:18,627 --> 00:22:20,367
That's right, I know all about you.

399
00:22:20,462 --> 00:22:23,454
You're why we don't have a living
witness who can identify John lark

400
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:25,255
or the apostles.

401
00:22:25,342 --> 00:22:27,879
If you have a problem
with my methods,

402
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,926
you can always stay behind.

403
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:33,506
"Your mission, should you
choose to accept it."

404
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:35,387
Isn't that the thing?

405
00:22:35,477 --> 00:22:36,717
(Alarm blaring)

406
00:22:36,854 --> 00:22:38,814
Pilot: (On intercom)
Two minutes to decompression.

407
00:22:38,939 --> 00:22:42,682
Suit up. The widow is meeting lark
in 30 minutes.

408
00:22:56,165 --> 00:22:57,371
(Air hissing)

409
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:01,450
Pilot: Ten seconds to decompression.

410
00:23:04,673 --> 00:23:05,913
Is your oxygen on?

411
00:23:07,968 --> 00:23:10,425
There is no atmosphere
at this altitude.

412
00:23:10,512 --> 00:23:12,298
I don't need you
blacking out on me.

413
00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:13,595
(Door opens)

414
00:23:15,142 --> 00:23:17,929
Hey, your heads-up display has
a built-in guidance system.

415
00:23:19,355 --> 00:23:21,061
Open your chute when the system says,

416
00:23:21,148 --> 00:23:22,809
not before and definitely not after,

417
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,586
or the last thing that
goes through your mind

418
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,396
will be your kneecaps. Is that clear?

419
00:23:26,487 --> 00:23:27,567
Crystal.

420
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:39,909
(Thunder rumbling)

421
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:51,880
We got to talk. We need to rethink this.

422
00:23:51,971 --> 00:23:53,256
Out of my way, hunt.

423
00:23:53,347 --> 00:23:55,283
Walker, we've got a problem.
There's a storm. We need to...

424
00:23:55,307 --> 00:23:57,263
- (Air hissing)
- Walker: Enough talk.

425
00:23:57,351 --> 00:23:59,012
I'll see you in Paris.

426
00:24:00,437 --> 00:24:02,428
(Breathing heavily)

427
00:24:05,526 --> 00:24:07,517
Come on, come on, come on.

428
00:24:17,246 --> 00:24:18,656
(Breathing deeply)

429
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:23,082
Automated voice:
Altitude: 25,000 feet.

430
00:24:28,716 --> 00:24:29,716
Ethan: Walker?

431
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,088
Walker: What's the matter, hunt?
You afraid of a little lightning?

432
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,470
(Grunts)

433
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:44,641
Automated voice:
Altitude: 20,000 feet.

434
00:24:44,732 --> 00:24:46,313
Ethan: Son of a bitch.

435
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,482
(Panting) Walker?

436
00:24:50,904 --> 00:24:52,314
Do you copy?

437
00:24:53,741 --> 00:24:55,072
Walker?

438
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,320
Walker?

439
00:25:07,421 --> 00:25:08,456
Come on.

440
00:25:08,547 --> 00:25:11,254
Automated voice: Altitude: 15,000 feet.

441
00:25:14,678 --> 00:25:15,838
Walker.

442
00:25:16,764 --> 00:25:17,924
Walker! (Grunts)

443
00:25:28,942 --> 00:25:30,102
Walker!

444
00:25:31,111 --> 00:25:32,271
Walker!

445
00:25:32,613 --> 00:25:35,104
Automated voice: Altitude: 10,000 feet.

446
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:36,609
(Ethan grunting)

447
00:25:38,535 --> 00:25:39,650
9,000.

448
00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:41,030
Ethan: Oh, shit.

449
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,780
Automated voice: 8,000.

450
00:25:47,795 --> 00:25:49,285
7,000.

451
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,210
6,000.

452
00:25:57,387 --> 00:25:58,877
5,000.

453
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:02,969
4,000.

454
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,310
Walker!

455
00:26:04,645 --> 00:26:05,805
Walker!

456
00:26:06,647 --> 00:26:07,727
3,000.

457
00:26:07,981 --> 00:26:10,222
Deploy. Deploy. Deploy.

458
00:26:10,317 --> 00:26:12,603
Deploy. Deploy. Deploy.

459
00:26:12,694 --> 00:26:14,810
Deploy. Deploy.

460
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:19,777
(Grunting)

461
00:26:22,287 --> 00:26:23,697
(Panting)

462
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,291
Oh, god.

463
00:26:30,003 --> 00:26:31,413
(Grunting)

464
00:26:37,553 --> 00:26:38,553
(Groans)

465
00:26:38,846 --> 00:26:40,837
(Muffled music playing)

466
00:26:50,607 --> 00:26:52,268
Looks like you lost your oxygen.

467
00:27:06,707 --> 00:27:08,538
(Music playing louder)

468
00:27:11,128 --> 00:27:12,618
(Crowd cheering)

469
00:27:15,507 --> 00:27:17,338
That's where the widow is meeting lark.

470
00:27:29,104 --> 00:27:30,139
(Beeps)

471
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:35,102
(Crowd cheering)

472
00:27:37,237 --> 00:27:39,068
(Upbeat music playing)

473
00:28:00,302 --> 00:28:01,302
Walker: Ethan.

474
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:03,419
- Walker.
- Ethan, if you can hear me,

475
00:28:03,513 --> 00:28:04,513
I've got him.

476
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:07,343
Say again. Where?

477
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:09,304
He's headed for the bathroom.

478
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:43,629
(Indistinct chatter)

479
00:28:58,151 --> 00:28:59,561
(Toilet flushes)

480
00:29:00,445 --> 00:29:02,276
(Speaking French)

481
00:29:06,743 --> 00:29:07,823
(Toilet flushes)

482
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:11,244
(Men speaking French)

483
00:29:54,124 --> 00:29:55,124
(Door closes)

484
00:29:55,751 --> 00:29:57,582
(Both grunting)

485
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:06,542
- Where's the needle?
- Didn't need it.

486
00:30:06,636 --> 00:30:08,877
- (Indistinct chatter)
- Get him up.

487
00:30:15,228 --> 00:30:16,638
(Indistinct chatter)

488
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:38,999
Hey, hey. (Shushing)

489
00:30:39,753 --> 00:30:41,163
(Speaking French)

490
00:30:42,714 --> 00:30:44,124
(Device humming)

491
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:45,918
(Indistinct chatter continues)

492
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,090
(Knocking on door)

493
00:30:55,185 --> 00:30:56,470
(Jeering in French)

494
00:30:57,229 --> 00:30:58,229
(Speaking French)

495
00:30:58,355 --> 00:31:00,767
Don't be shy, the more the merrier.

496
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:01,899
Come on, we re not mean.

497
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:02,931
Can we join you?

498
00:31:02,943 --> 00:31:05,150
Can we join you? We won't bite, guys.

499
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:08,941
(Indistinct chatter)

500
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:11,777
(Laughing)

501
00:31:13,203 --> 00:31:15,194
(All singing in French)

502
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:19,910
(Door opens)

503
00:31:23,171 --> 00:31:24,286

504
00:31:25,215 --> 00:31:26,625

506
00:31:36,184 --> 00:31:37,594
(Both grunting)

507
00:32:01,543 --> 00:32:02,749
(Straining)

508
00:32:02,836 --> 00:32:04,417
(Groaning)

509
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:11,000
(Huffs)

510
00:32:15,265 --> 00:32:16,675

511
00:32:23,773 --> 00:32:24,853

515
00:32:52,552 --> 00:32:53,758
- (Gunshot)
(Gasps)

516
00:32:55,931 --> 00:32:57,467
(Panting)

517
00:33:00,894 --> 00:33:02,259
(Whispers) Shit.

518
00:33:13,573 --> 00:33:15,564
(Glass crunching)

519
00:33:21,164 --> 00:33:24,577
- Can you still make a mask?
- I need a face to make a mask.

520
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:27,956
Sorry. I was aiming for his chest.

521
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:31,713
- What are you doing here?
- It's good to see you, too.

522
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,337
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
You are...

523
00:33:36,346 --> 00:33:37,836
An old friend.

524
00:33:50,735 --> 00:33:52,896
Walker: Cancel extraction.
We're code blue.

525
00:33:53,738 --> 00:33:55,353
Send sanitation.

526
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:57,530
North men's room.

527
00:33:59,953 --> 00:34:02,365
You didn't answer my question.
What are you doing here?

528
00:34:02,497 --> 00:34:03,862
(Indistinct chatter)

529
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:07,415
That's it. Just take it easy.
That's it.

530
00:34:07,502 --> 00:34:09,462
Just keep your head back
until the bleeding stops.

531
00:34:09,546 --> 00:34:10,786
What is it, eh? (Speaks French)

532
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,996
You want some, too?

533
00:34:14,843 --> 00:34:17,004
(In English) You're not here
by accident. Who sent you?

534
00:34:17,262 --> 00:34:18,593
I can't tell you that.

535
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,680
What are you doing?

536
00:34:19,764 --> 00:34:20,992
I have a date with the white widow.

537
00:34:21,016 --> 00:34:23,507
He had a date with the widow.
You look nothing like him.

538
00:34:23,977 --> 00:34:26,218
And now we have to hope
they never met.

539
00:34:26,313 --> 00:34:29,146
- Hope is not a strategy!
- Oh, you must be new.

540
00:34:29,566 --> 00:34:30,566
I have no other choice.

541
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:32,231
The white widow's our only lead.

542
00:34:32,319 --> 00:34:33,754
I got to be this guy for five minutes.

543
00:34:33,778 --> 00:34:35,564
- Don't do it.
- Ethan: What?

544
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,651
What is it?
What aren't you telling me?

545
00:34:38,908 --> 00:34:40,428
You don't understand
what you're involved in.

546
00:34:40,452 --> 00:34:42,067
I don't understand
what I'm involved in.

547
00:34:42,495 --> 00:34:44,907
I don't understand
what I'm involved in?

548
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,865
What am I involved in?

549
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,793
If you're meeting the widow,
she leaves in three minutes.

550
00:34:53,256 --> 00:34:54,746
Ilsa: Ethan!
Ethan: I'll make it work.

551
00:34:54,841 --> 00:34:56,547
- Ethan!
- I'll make it work.

552
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:00,468
The name's Walker.

553
00:35:00,555 --> 00:35:02,671
Yeah? You're welcome.

554
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,891
(Dance music playing)

555
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:17,272
(Beeping)

556
00:35:21,993 --> 00:35:23,054
What do you think you're doing?

557
00:35:23,078 --> 00:35:24,680
- I'm going with you.
- Like hell you are.

558
00:35:24,704 --> 00:35:25,848
People have been sent here to kill lark.

559
00:35:25,872 --> 00:35:26,872
No shit.

560
00:35:26,956 --> 00:35:29,072
No, not me. Contractors. Paid assassins.

561
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:30,901
They don't know what he looks like,

562
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,647
they only know he's meeting
the widow at midnight.

563
00:35:32,671 --> 00:35:33,911
If you go through with this,

564
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:36,317
they're gonna believe you're lark
and they're gonna kill you.

565
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:37,706
How do you know all this?

566
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:41,126
I can't tell you that.

567
00:35:43,598 --> 00:35:45,759
You should've stayed out of the game.

568
00:35:47,769 --> 00:35:49,680
You should've come with me.

569
00:35:58,113 --> 00:36:01,605
Widow: This charity was started
in honor of my mother.

570
00:36:02,283 --> 00:36:05,116
Those of you who knew her
understood her strength,

571
00:36:05,453 --> 00:36:08,115
her tenacity, her resourcefulness.

572
00:36:08,206 --> 00:36:09,206
(People laughing)

573
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:12,032
But there was another side to her,

574
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:14,118
a side most people never saw.

575
00:36:14,462 --> 00:36:17,920
It is that part of her spirit
that has brought us

576
00:36:18,007 --> 00:36:19,793
all together tonight.

577
00:36:20,468 --> 00:36:23,460
Max was something of a paradox.

578
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,222
She had a fascination for paradoxes,

579
00:36:28,977 --> 00:36:31,810
a fascination she passed on to me.

580
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:37,815
Max had no illusions about
the world we live in today.

581
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:41,733
But she had dreams
of a very different future.

582
00:36:42,657 --> 00:36:46,241
One in which her unique talents
were no longer required.

583
00:36:47,078 --> 00:36:49,569
All she earned from the way the world is

584
00:36:49,998 --> 00:36:53,661
went ultimately to making it
what it could someday be.

585
00:36:54,169 --> 00:36:56,660
That future isn't here yet.

586
00:36:57,881 --> 00:37:02,625
Tonight, your contributions
have brought it just a little closer.

587
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,129
(Applause)

588
00:37:06,389 --> 00:37:08,129
Thank you all for coming.

589
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,805
Enjoy the party.

590
00:37:13,772 --> 00:37:15,558
(Jazz music playing)

591
00:37:30,288 --> 00:37:33,405
You can't possibly be John lark.

592
00:37:36,753 --> 00:37:38,584
I'm not, actually.

593
00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:41,083
It's an alias.

594
00:37:43,676 --> 00:37:45,837
I suppose it's better than John Doe.

595
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:47,239
Is there another name you prefer?

596
00:37:47,263 --> 00:37:49,003
Is there somewhere
we could talk privately?

597
00:37:49,098 --> 00:37:51,339
In fact I like "lark."
It does have a certain ring.

598
00:37:51,434 --> 00:37:52,536
We don't have a lot of time.

599
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,096
'Cause I'll be honest.

600
00:37:54,187 --> 00:37:56,519
A man of your reputation,
I was expecting someone

601
00:37:57,023 --> 00:37:58,183
uglier.

602
00:37:58,274 --> 00:37:59,274
(Gasps)

603
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,691
Don't let looks deceive.
I'm as ugly as they come.

604
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:04,523
And I'll be honest with you.
Your life is in danger.

605
00:38:06,157 --> 00:38:07,363
Don't you touch her.

606
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,441
Relax. It's my brother.

607
00:38:10,703 --> 00:38:12,318
You're being rude to our guest, zola.

608
00:38:12,872 --> 00:38:14,203
It's time to go.

609
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:16,702
Don't turn this into a scene.

610
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:20,417
You don't want to be with this one.

611
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,757
- You were saying?
- Your life is in danger.

612
00:38:30,265 --> 00:38:31,550
And who would want to kill me?

613
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:33,097
The Americans, for starters.

614
00:38:33,268 --> 00:38:34,758
If that were true, I would know it.

615
00:38:34,936 --> 00:38:37,518
You think you're the only one
with spies in the government?

616
00:38:38,106 --> 00:38:40,939
There are people here
who don't want this meeting to happen.

617
00:38:41,276 --> 00:38:42,607
Don't believe me?

618
00:38:43,278 --> 00:38:44,609
Look around.

619
00:38:56,749 --> 00:38:58,239
I know what you're thinking.

620
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:00,707
Maybe they're not here for you.

621
00:39:00,795 --> 00:39:02,831
Maybe they're just here for me.

622
00:39:03,172 --> 00:39:05,333
Are you willing to take that chance?

623
00:39:06,175 --> 00:39:08,166
You have something I want.

624
00:39:08,511 --> 00:39:10,718
Right now, that makes me
the only person you can trust

625
00:39:10,805 --> 00:39:12,670
to get you out of here alive.

626
00:39:13,016 --> 00:39:15,348
Or would you rather leave that
to your brother?

627
00:39:19,689 --> 00:39:23,181
I think I'd like
to go home now, Mr. lark.

628
00:39:30,366 --> 00:39:31,366
(Knife unsheathes)

629
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:32,861
(Grunting)

630
00:39:32,994 --> 00:39:33,994
(Man groans)

631
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:40,623
- (Both grunting)
- (People exclaiming)

632
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:41,919
(People gasp)

633
00:39:45,006 --> 00:39:46,416
(Panicked chatter)

634
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:09,811
- (Grunting)
(Woman yelps)

635
00:40:12,575 --> 00:40:14,406
- (Gunshot)
(People screaming)

636
00:41:13,761 --> 00:41:15,592
(Guns cocking)

637
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:40,952
The French government took receipt
of the asset at noon today.

638
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:43,405
Delivery will be via air
to the finance ministry

639
00:41:43,499 --> 00:41:44,699
at 8:00 A.M. tomorrow morning.

640
00:41:45,376 --> 00:41:47,207
An armored motorcade
under heavy police escort

641
00:41:47,295 --> 00:41:49,206
will transport him via this route.

642
00:41:49,714 --> 00:41:52,547
We'll create a diversion
at this intersection, here.

643
00:41:53,009 --> 00:41:56,593
The motorcade will automatically take
the preplanned alternate route here,

644
00:41:57,263 --> 00:41:59,254
where we'll extract the asset.

645
00:42:00,516 --> 00:42:02,347
Extract the asset?

646
00:42:13,446 --> 00:42:14,777
The asset.

647
00:42:16,866 --> 00:42:19,733
We paid a great deal of money
for this information.

648
00:42:19,827 --> 00:42:22,409
They gave us everything
but this man's name.

649
00:42:22,497 --> 00:42:25,034
You don't happen to know
who he is, do you?

650
00:42:26,167 --> 00:42:27,907
His name is Solomon Lane.

651
00:42:28,002 --> 00:42:30,664
British special agent turned anarchist.

652
00:42:31,672 --> 00:42:33,708
He used rogue covert operatives

653
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,086
to create a terror network
called the syndicate.

654
00:42:37,261 --> 00:42:40,003
Sabotage, assassination, mass murder.

655
00:42:40,348 --> 00:42:42,339
As ugly as they come.

656
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:46,347
Walker: He was captured
by American agents two years ago.

657
00:42:46,687 --> 00:42:49,645
Since then, he's been in
a never-ending interrogation,

658
00:42:49,732 --> 00:42:51,939
passed around from
one government to another

659
00:42:53,277 --> 00:42:55,438
to answer for his crimes.

660
00:42:58,282 --> 00:42:59,772
You seem displeased, lark.

661
00:43:00,785 --> 00:43:03,447
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

662
00:43:04,455 --> 00:43:06,787
I came to Paris for plutonium.

663
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:09,616
Well, there must be a misunderstanding.

664
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,621
I'm just a broker.

665
00:43:11,712 --> 00:43:13,794
I connect a buyer and a seller.

666
00:43:14,465 --> 00:43:18,208
My seller's not interested in cash,
so if you want the plutonium...

667
00:43:19,053 --> 00:43:20,543
Extract Lane

668
00:43:21,305 --> 00:43:22,886
and make a trade.

669
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:24,551
Widow: That's right.

670
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,312
How do I know
the seller has what I want?

671
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:52,833
Widow: A down payment in good faith.

672
00:43:53,671 --> 00:43:56,504
A courier will deliver
two more within 48 hours

673
00:43:56,841 --> 00:43:59,332
in exchange for him.

674
00:44:07,768 --> 00:44:08,768
All right.

675
00:44:09,645 --> 00:44:11,727
What happens after the diversion?

676
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,100
(Inaudible)

677
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:46,734
Kill everyone?

678
00:45:47,201 --> 00:45:48,441
That's your plan?

679
00:45:48,953 --> 00:45:50,784
There will be no withesses.

680
00:45:50,871 --> 00:45:53,783
What's my guarantee that Lane
walks out of this thing alive?

681
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:55,326
He's in an armored box.

682
00:45:56,127 --> 00:45:58,038
We'll pull him out when it's safe.

683
00:45:58,713 --> 00:46:00,044
You want your plutonium,

684
00:46:00,798 --> 00:46:02,288
this is the price.

685
00:46:04,468 --> 00:46:06,754
Or do you draw the line at killing cops?

686
00:46:06,846 --> 00:46:09,053
That's John lark you're talking to.

687
00:46:12,226 --> 00:46:15,389
I murder women and children
with smallpox.

688
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:19,430
I have no line.

689
00:46:23,654 --> 00:46:24,769
Right.

690
00:46:25,156 --> 00:46:28,148
Sleep well, everyone. Busy day tomorrow.

691
00:46:48,262 --> 00:46:50,253
Sloane: You have got to be kidding me.

692
00:46:50,598 --> 00:46:53,089
If you want Lane out of prison,
this is how it gets done.

693
00:46:53,351 --> 00:46:56,263
I wanted lark to break him out,
not Ethan hunt.

694
00:46:56,354 --> 00:47:00,188
I wanted lark at the exchange,
not Ethan hunt.

695
00:47:00,649 --> 00:47:03,391
I wanted lark to lead us
to the plutonium

696
00:47:03,486 --> 00:47:05,272
and the apostles.

697
00:47:05,363 --> 00:47:06,883
Walker: You may still get your chance.

698
00:47:07,073 --> 00:47:08,800
Have you forgotten about
the corpse we pulled

699
00:47:08,824 --> 00:47:10,260
out of the men's room
at the grand palais?

700
00:47:10,284 --> 00:47:12,070
I'm guessing that wasn't lark.

701
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:13,571
More likely one of lark's recruits.

702
00:47:13,662 --> 00:47:15,869
Not according to our intelligence.

703
00:47:16,248 --> 00:47:18,159
Intelligence gathered by whom?

704
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:21,792
Hunt.

705
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:26,088
You've long held suspicions that lark
was an American agent.

706
00:47:26,175 --> 00:47:27,790
Someone who knew our every move.

707
00:47:27,885 --> 00:47:30,092
Someone who could
come and go like a ghost.

708
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:34,130
You're suggesting hunt is John lark.

709
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:39,344
You're reaching, Walker.
Trying to save your ass.

710
00:47:39,688 --> 00:47:41,178
It won't work.

711
00:47:41,482 --> 00:47:44,599
Think about it.
Would a man as careful as lark

712
00:47:44,693 --> 00:47:46,729
really stick his neck out like that?

713
00:47:46,821 --> 00:47:48,812
For a face-to-face with the white widow?

714
00:47:49,156 --> 00:47:51,613
- He'd send a proxy.
- A decoy.

715
00:47:51,867 --> 00:47:53,482
And if he was really smart,

716
00:47:53,577 --> 00:47:56,193
he'd have his lady friend
kill that decoy

717
00:47:56,288 --> 00:47:58,199
in front of a reliable witness.

718
00:47:58,290 --> 00:47:59,290
Me.

719
00:47:59,834 --> 00:48:02,746
The dragnet is closing in
on his terrorist alter ego.

720
00:48:03,087 --> 00:48:05,749
So he pays a man
to play the part of lark

721
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,000
and has him killed.

722
00:48:07,842 --> 00:48:10,254
And under the guise
of serving his country...

723
00:48:10,594 --> 00:48:12,926
Assumes his own secret identity.

724
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,590
Free to operate at will

725
00:48:14,682 --> 00:48:16,442
with the full support
of the U.S. government.

726
00:48:16,475 --> 00:48:17,681
Why?

727
00:48:18,185 --> 00:48:20,016
Why would hunt turn?

728
00:48:20,354 --> 00:48:23,346
Why did Lane do it?
Why did any of his apostles?

729
00:48:24,108 --> 00:48:26,850
They were believers in a cause.

730
00:48:27,194 --> 00:48:29,435
And when that cause
turned out to be a lie,

731
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:32,317
they turned
against their masters.

732
00:48:32,408 --> 00:48:35,616
How many times has hunt's
government betrayed him,

733
00:48:35,703 --> 00:48:37,443
disavowed him, cast him aside?

734
00:48:37,872 --> 00:48:40,534
And how long before
a man like that

735
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:42,406
has had enough?

736
00:48:43,043 --> 00:48:45,705
That 1s a serious accusation.

737
00:48:47,381 --> 00:48:48,871
Can you prove it?

738
00:48:52,636 --> 00:48:54,422
This is the phone
we pulled off the dead body

739
00:48:54,513 --> 00:48:55,878
at the grand palais.

740
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:03,682
I'm guessing
it has all the proof you need.

741
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:52,070
(Gun cocks)

742
00:50:07,461 --> 00:50:08,496
(Beeps)

743
00:50:13,717 --> 00:50:15,548
(Helicopter approaching)

744
00:51:07,605 --> 00:51:10,768
Walker: Is it true Lane gassed
a village of 2,000 people?

745
00:51:13,277 --> 00:51:14,277
Yes.

746
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:16,818
Is it true he brought down
an entire passenger plane

747
00:51:16,905 --> 00:51:17,905
just to kill one man?

748
00:51:19,491 --> 00:51:20,651
Yes.

749
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:23,780
- Is it true that he...
- Hey, Walker.

750
00:51:24,288 --> 00:51:26,950
Whatever you heard,
if it makes your skin crawl,

751
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:28,622
it's probably true.

752
00:51:34,632 --> 00:51:36,122
Holy shit.

753
00:51:37,801 --> 00:51:40,042
You're the guy
that caught him, aren't you?

754
00:51:41,889 --> 00:51:42,969
How long do you think

755
00:51:43,057 --> 00:51:44,547
he's gonna keep that to himself?

756
00:51:48,646 --> 00:51:50,853
We'll burn that bridge
when we get to it.

757
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:41,774
(Speaks French)

758
00:52:42,032 --> 00:52:43,238
(Engine starts)

759
00:52:59,174 --> 00:53:00,584
(Tires screeching)

760
00:53:40,924 --> 00:53:42,130
(Truck engine starts)

761
00:53:50,726 --> 00:53:52,136
(Tires screeching)

762
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:16,202
(Soldiers shouting indistinctly)

763
00:54:19,296 --> 00:54:21,412
(In English) What the hell is he doing?

764
00:54:25,594 --> 00:54:27,801
- (Tires screech)
(All grunt)

765
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,236
(Panicked chatter)

766
00:54:51,662 --> 00:54:53,493
(Inhaling deeply)

767

770

(Both grunting)

771
00:56:20,626 --> 00:56:22,036
(Engine revving)

772
00:56:24,504 --> 00:56:26,415
- (Engine stalling)
(Officers shouting)

773
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:35,720
Hunt? Where are you?

774
00:56:35,807 --> 00:56:37,547
Don't wait for me!

775
00:56:37,643 --> 00:56:40,225
- What is it? What's wrong?
- (Engine starts)

776
00:56:40,312 --> 00:56:41,722
I'll meet you at the garage.

777
00:56:47,611 --> 00:56:48,817
(Siren blares)

778
00:56:51,698 --> 00:56:53,029
Benji, do you copy?

779
00:56:53,575 --> 00:56:54,860
We copy. Go.

780
00:56:54,952 --> 00:56:58,069
Change of plan. I'm blown.
Need extraction.

781
00:56:58,163 --> 00:56:59,744
We're on our way.

782
00:57:12,928 --> 00:57:14,208
(Woman speaking French on radio)

783
00:57:14,304 --> 00:57:18,172
He's heading from notre dame to the
St. Louis bridge. Units are in pursuit...

784
00:57:52,384 --> 00:57:53,384
(Horns honking)

785
00:58:02,936 --> 00:58:04,142

(Panting)

796
01:01:00,113 --> 01:01:01,319
(Inaudible)

797
01:01:21,176 --> 01:01:23,007
(Indistinct chatter on radio)

798
01:01:38,735 --> 01:01:39,735
(Speaking French)

799
01:01:39,819 --> 01:01:40,819
Stop.

800
01:01:41,571 --> 01:01:42,777
Stay where you are.

801
01:01:43,782 --> 01:01:44,782
Get in the car.

802
01:01:45,909 --> 01:01:46,909
Nobody move.

803
01:01:50,497 --> 01:01:51,497
Show me your hands.

804
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:53,666
(Both speaking French)

805
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:54,956
Walk away...

806
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,619
Walk away... please.

807
01:01:55,752 --> 01:01:56,332
Everyone...

808
01:01:56,336 --> 01:01:57,576
Everyone... show me your hands.

809
01:02:03,843 --> 01:02:05,424
Just walk away...

810
01:02:05,428 --> 01:02:06,543
Just walk away... please.

811
01:02:10,141 --> 01:02:11,176
(Both speaking French)

812
01:02:15,522 --> 01:02:17,183
(In English) Zola wants a word with you.

813
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,310
(Groaning)

814
01:02:20,402 --> 01:02:21,402
(Both speaking French)

815
01:02:21,528 --> 01:02:22,563
What about her?

816
01:02:23,029 --> 01:02:24,029
Finish her.

817
01:02:39,963 --> 01:02:40,963
(Gunshot)

818
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:53,180

(Speaking French)

820
01:02:54,477 --> 01:02:56,058
You'll be all right.

821
01:02:57,939 --> 01:02:59,059
(Man speaks French on radio)

822
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:00,396
(Speaking French)

823
01:03:04,029 --> 01:03:05,519
Benji: (In English) We got to go.

824

(Speaking French)

825
01:03:06,781 --> 01:03:08,612
I 'm so sorry.

826
01:03:08,616 --> 01:03:09,616
Benji: Come on.

827
01:03:18,251 --> 01:03:19,457
(Engine starts)

828
01:03:35,977 --> 01:03:37,387
(Sirens wailing)

829
01:03:45,945 --> 01:03:47,685
The name's Walker, by the way.

830
01:03:48,114 --> 01:03:50,105
Was the little car your idea?

831
01:03:59,584 --> 01:04:01,495
- (Lane groans)
- Benji: Jesus Christ!

832
01:04:02,379 --> 01:04:04,106
- What the hell was that?
- (Silenced gunshot)

833
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:05,370
(Engine revving)

(Tires screeching)

835
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:12,302
- Everybody out.
- Benji: Go, go, go!

01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,873
(Horns honking)

837
01:05:02,021 --> 01:05:03,021
(Gunshot)

838
01:05:05,066 --> 01:05:06,476
(Horn blaring)

839
01:05:30,049 --> 01:05:31,630
- (Horn honking)

(Shifting gears)

845

(Sighs)

846
01:06:49,504 --> 01:06:50,835
That was llsa.

847
01:06:51,548 --> 01:06:52,879
Shut up.

848
01:06:53,383 --> 01:06:54,964
Very interesting.

849
01:06:58,429 --> 01:07:00,761
It's good to see you again, Ethan.

850
01:07:09,023 --> 01:07:10,103
(Groans)

851
01:07:13,444 --> 01:07:15,275
- (Panting)
- (Sirens wailing)

852
01:07:18,116 --> 01:07:19,116
(Groans)

853
01:07:37,594 --> 01:07:40,427
Oh, look who's still alive.

854
01:07:44,225 --> 01:07:46,011
There's a microwave tracker in his neck.

855
01:07:46,102 --> 01:07:47,717
Got it. You know what to do.

856
01:07:47,812 --> 01:07:50,019
Let me just assure you, this won't hurt

857
01:07:50,106 --> 01:07:51,471
enough.

858
01:07:53,735 --> 01:07:56,147
- Ninety seconds.
- (Timer ticking)

859
01:07:56,237 --> 01:07:58,157
You and your apostles think
we're gonna trade you

860
01:07:58,197 --> 01:07:59,903
for the missing plutonium.

861
01:07:59,991 --> 01:08:02,607
I'm here to tell you
that's never gonna happen.

862
01:08:02,702 --> 01:08:06,069
"Your mission, should you
choose to accept it."

863
01:08:07,081 --> 01:08:08,912
I wonder, Ethan,

864
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,490
did you ever choose not to?

865
01:08:11,252 --> 01:08:12,833
Did you ever stop and ask yourself

866
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:15,753
who it was giving you the orders or why?

867
01:08:16,549 --> 01:08:18,289
While every day the master you serve

868
01:08:18,384 --> 01:08:20,545
moves one step closer
to ending the world.

869
01:08:21,012 --> 01:08:23,128
Strange accusation
coming from a terrorist.

870
01:08:23,222 --> 01:08:24,337
Sixty seconds.

871
01:08:24,432 --> 01:08:26,468
Terrorists are schoolboys
desperate for attention,

872
01:08:26,559 --> 01:08:30,268
hoping to shape
public opinion through fear.

873
01:08:30,355 --> 01:08:33,597
I don't care in the least
what people think or feel.

874
01:08:34,025 --> 01:08:36,391
In my experience,
they don't do either for very long.

875
01:08:36,486 --> 01:08:38,631
Benji: Oh, and I suppose that
justifies bombing factories

876
01:08:38,655 --> 01:08:40,191
or bringing down civilian aircraft.

877
01:08:40,448 --> 01:08:42,814
Or strapping me
into an explosive vest!

878
01:08:42,909 --> 01:08:45,992
Consider it unfinished business,
my funny little friend.

879
01:08:46,204 --> 01:08:47,990
- Luther?
Almost there.

880
01:08:48,081 --> 01:08:50,197
Lane: You see the end
as clearly as I do, Ethan.

881
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:53,033
Governments the world over
are descending into madness.

882
01:08:53,503 --> 01:08:57,246
The syndicate was created
to tear them down, brick by brick.

883
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,331
The syndicate was
a pack of murdering cowards.

884
01:08:59,425 --> 01:09:03,088
The syndicate
was civilization's last hope!

885
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:06,592
A chance to smash the old world order.

886
01:09:06,974 --> 01:09:08,965
That hope is gone now
because of you

887
01:09:09,394 --> 01:09:11,680
and your pathetic morality.

888
01:09:11,771 --> 01:09:13,602
(Helicopter approaching)

889
01:09:13,731 --> 01:09:15,517
You should have killed me, Ethan.

890
01:09:18,236 --> 01:09:20,101
The end you've always feared

891
01:09:20,738 --> 01:09:22,069
is coming.

892
01:09:22,615 --> 01:09:23,695
(Exhaling sharply)

893
01:09:24,492 --> 01:09:26,153
It's coming!

894
01:09:27,995 --> 01:09:30,907
And the blood will be on your hands.

895
01:09:33,251 --> 01:09:34,832
The fallout

896
01:09:35,336 --> 01:09:38,578
of all your good intentions.

897
01:09:39,048 --> 01:09:40,538
(Sirens wailing in distance)

898
01:09:43,428 --> 01:09:44,508
(Timer stops)

899
01:09:44,595 --> 01:09:46,802
- Time.
- Got it.

900
01:09:51,811 --> 01:09:53,096
(Device beeping)

901
01:09:57,442 --> 01:09:59,273
(Sirens wailing overhead)

902
01:10:02,155 --> 01:10:03,986
(Helicopter passing overhead)

903
01:10:07,785 --> 01:10:08,991
(Sirens fade)

904
01:10:11,414 --> 01:10:12,745
Get him up.

905
01:10:15,543 --> 01:10:16,908
You're mine now.

906
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:28,211
Widow: You're just
full of surprises, lark.

907
01:10:28,306 --> 01:10:30,638
Ethan: Your brother's plan
was bad from the word go.

908
01:10:30,975 --> 01:10:32,886
You'd have lost all your men

909
01:10:32,977 --> 01:10:34,817
and Lane would've been killed
in the crossfire.

910
01:10:35,438 --> 01:10:37,099
I had to improvise.

911
01:10:37,648 --> 01:10:40,230
Widow: Well, why not say that
in the first place?

912
01:10:40,318 --> 01:10:42,104
Ethan: Because I don't
trust your people.

913
01:10:42,195 --> 01:10:44,481
Especially not your brother.

914
01:10:48,075 --> 01:10:51,067
Family. What can you do?

915
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:56,031
So, where's Lane?

916
01:10:56,125 --> 01:10:58,366
Certainly not at the bottom
of the seine.

917
01:10:58,461 --> 01:11:00,201
I have him. He's safe.

918
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,711
Where do I meet the courier?

919
01:11:04,342 --> 01:11:05,673
Let's talk about the woman.

920
01:11:08,012 --> 01:11:09,172
Woman?

921
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:10,715
She was with you at the palais.

922
01:11:10,807 --> 01:11:12,172
Zola saw her again today.

923
01:11:12,517 --> 01:11:14,007
She tried to kill Lane.

924
01:11:14,101 --> 01:11:16,183
She had the chance to kill you,
but she didn't.

925
01:11:16,604 --> 01:11:17,604
Why?

926
01:11:21,609 --> 01:11:23,190
We have a past.

927
01:11:24,529 --> 01:11:25,860
It's complicated.

928
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:30,322
Well, I'll make it
more complicated for you.

929
01:11:30,827 --> 01:11:32,818
My price just went up.

930
01:11:32,912 --> 01:11:35,073
Someone killed four of my men today.

931
01:11:35,164 --> 01:11:36,745
I'm assuming it was her.

932
01:11:43,089 --> 01:11:45,000
I want her, lark.

933
01:11:45,842 --> 01:11:47,582
And you're gonna bring her to me.

934
01:11:48,594 --> 01:11:50,459
Otherwise, you don't meet the courier

935
01:11:50,555 --> 01:11:52,921
and the plutonium goes
to the highest bidder.

936
01:11:54,308 --> 01:11:56,640
I'd hate for her
to come between us.

937
01:12:00,857 --> 01:12:02,188
She's yours.

938
01:12:03,067 --> 01:12:05,524
At the meeting. Not before.

939
01:12:17,999 --> 01:12:19,330
Go to London.

940
01:12:20,418 --> 01:12:22,249
Instructions will follow.

941
01:14:03,771 --> 01:14:06,638
I knew if I followed her,
you'd show up eventually.

942
01:14:06,941 --> 01:14:08,272
Are you okay?

943
01:14:10,569 --> 01:14:11,900
Lisa, I never wanted to hurt you.

944
01:14:11,988 --> 01:14:14,070
I know you have your reasons.

945
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:15,775
I know.

946
01:14:19,912 --> 01:14:21,573
You need to walk away.

947
01:14:21,664 --> 01:14:22,995
I can't do that.

948
01:14:24,709 --> 01:14:27,246
You weren't at the palais to kill lark.

949
01:14:27,336 --> 01:14:28,451
No.

950
01:14:30,297 --> 01:14:31,833
You were there to protect him.

951
01:14:32,508 --> 01:14:33,543
Yes.

952
01:14:33,634 --> 01:14:35,420
And you killed him to protect me.

953
01:14:37,847 --> 01:14:40,179
You wanted lark to break Lane out.

954
01:14:41,809 --> 01:14:45,051
No. You needed him to break Lane out.

955
01:14:45,855 --> 01:14:47,971
Because you have to kill Lane.

956
01:14:49,358 --> 01:14:51,314
Who's making you do this?

957
01:14:52,945 --> 01:14:54,526
Mig.

958
01:14:57,158 --> 01:14:58,158
Why?

959
01:14:58,409 --> 01:15:00,240
After we captured him in London,

960
01:15:00,327 --> 01:15:03,615
they tried to bring Lane home
through diplomatic channels.

961
01:15:03,706 --> 01:15:06,368
But too many countries
want their pound of flesh.

962
01:15:06,459 --> 01:15:08,370
A man like that, what he's seen,

963
01:15:08,461 --> 01:15:10,022
what he knows
about British intelligence,

964
01:15:10,046 --> 01:15:13,413
they can't have him talking
to a foreign government ever.

965
01:15:13,507 --> 01:15:15,168
That's not what I'm asking.

966
01:15:16,135 --> 01:15:17,466
Why did they send you?

967
01:15:18,554 --> 01:15:20,966
This is how I prove my loyalty.

968
01:15:21,682 --> 01:15:23,172
This is how I come home.

969
01:15:23,267 --> 01:15:25,053
But you were out.

970
01:15:25,144 --> 01:15:26,554
You were free.

971
01:15:26,645 --> 01:15:28,385
We are never free.

972
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:32,023
I spent two years undercover with Lane.

973
01:15:32,109 --> 01:15:34,816
To them, I'm as much
of a threat as he is.

974
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:39,363
I kill him, or I never stop running.

975
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:44,072
Now tell me where he is.

976
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:50,574
I can't help you.

977
01:15:50,669 --> 01:15:53,376
I will get to him one way or another.

978
01:15:54,465 --> 01:15:56,956
Please don't make me go through you.

979
01:16:34,922 --> 01:16:35,922
(Gasps)

980
01:16:44,932 --> 01:16:46,342
(Cell phone ringing)

981
01:16:53,023 --> 01:16:54,138
Yes.

982
01:16:54,233 --> 01:16:56,019
Widow: (On phone)
Are you here in London?

983
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:57,395
Ethan: I am.

984
01:16:57,486 --> 01:16:59,477
Are you ready to meet the courier?

985
01:17:00,156 --> 01:17:02,317
Yes. Where do I go?

986
01:17:02,658 --> 01:17:04,364
Where would you like to meet?

987
01:17:42,531 --> 01:17:43,531
Mr. secretary.

988
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:46,782
I prayed to god that it wasn't true.

989
01:17:46,869 --> 01:17:48,450
Benji: Well, in his defense, sir,

990
01:17:48,537 --> 01:17:49,993
if Ethan hadn't intervened,

991
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,474
a great many people
would have been killed.

992
01:17:51,498 --> 01:17:53,739
Yes, Dunn, I'm sure that
the good people of Paris

993
01:17:53,834 --> 01:17:56,997
and the nation of France as a whole
will take that into account.

994
01:17:58,130 --> 01:17:59,791
So what the hell happened?

995
01:18:06,722 --> 01:18:08,587
- (Device hisses)
(Exhales)

996
01:18:13,062 --> 01:18:14,268
(Device beeping)

997
01:18:19,068 --> 01:18:21,525
At which point, we were
told to come to London

998
01:18:22,196 --> 01:18:23,686
and await further instructions.

999
01:18:23,948 --> 01:18:25,279
And what happens now?

1000
01:18:26,075 --> 01:18:27,155
Now,

1001
01:18:28,202 --> 01:18:29,783
we meet the widow in 20 minutes.

1002
01:18:29,870 --> 01:18:31,360
She'll take us to a courier

1003
01:18:31,455 --> 01:18:34,538
who'll hand over our missing plutonium
in exchange for Solomon Lane.

1004
01:18:34,625 --> 01:18:36,206
Or, in our scenario,

1005
01:18:37,419 --> 01:18:38,659
Benji.

1006
01:18:39,088 --> 01:18:40,203
Jesus.

1007
01:18:40,589 --> 01:18:41,624
I'm sorry, what?

1008
01:18:41,715 --> 01:18:43,318
Ethan: Luther and I are gonna
take you to the courier.

1009
01:18:43,342 --> 01:18:45,022
Walker stays here
and guards the real Lane.

1010
01:18:45,094 --> 01:18:46,174
Absolutely not.

1011
01:18:46,262 --> 01:18:47,614
Wait, wait.
Why do I have to be Lane?

1012
01:18:47,638 --> 01:18:48,638
Benji.

1013
01:18:48,722 --> 01:18:51,555
Our mission, my mission,
is to recover that plutonium,

1014
01:18:51,642 --> 01:18:53,724
and I will do so at any cost.

1015
01:18:53,811 --> 01:18:55,472
Even if I have to trade Lane.

1016
01:18:55,562 --> 01:18:56,972
The real Lane.

1017
01:18:57,064 --> 01:18:59,100
And I will never let him go.

1018
01:18:59,191 --> 01:19:02,183
When the apostles realize
that you're playing games,

1019
01:19:02,278 --> 01:19:04,564
you'll lose the plutonium. Again.

1020
01:19:04,947 --> 01:19:06,653
You let us worry about the apostles.

1021
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:09,152
As it stands, we have a bigger problem.

1022
01:19:09,243 --> 01:19:10,699
A bigger problem?

1023
01:19:11,453 --> 01:19:12,943
- Llsa.
- Benji: Lisa?

1024
01:19:13,038 --> 01:19:14,574
Our Lisa? Llsa faust Lisa?

1025
01:19:14,665 --> 01:19:15,850
How is she mixed up in all of this?

1026
01:19:15,874 --> 01:19:18,206
She's been ordered
to kill Lane. Direct from MI6.

1027
01:19:18,294 --> 01:19:21,707
Look, wait. So that was her
in Paris? On the bike.

1028
01:19:21,797 --> 01:19:22,832
Yeah.

1029
01:19:22,923 --> 01:19:24,129
Ethan, she tried to kill us!

1030
01:19:24,216 --> 01:19:25,485
- Ethan: No, not us. Not us.
Yeah.

1031
01:19:25,509 --> 01:19:27,750
Lane. She tried to kill Lane.
She has no choice.

1032
01:19:27,845 --> 01:19:28,880
And she will kill me!

1033
01:19:29,054 --> 01:19:30,156
I'm not gonna let that happen.

1034
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:32,260
Ethan, how exactly are you
not gonna let that happen?

1035
01:19:33,767 --> 01:19:35,974
- I'm working on it.
- Oh, he's working on it.

1036
01:19:36,061 --> 01:19:37,497
Ethan: Right now,
we don't have a lot of time.

1037
01:19:37,521 --> 01:19:39,040
We have to get ready for this meeting.

1038
01:19:39,064 --> 01:19:40,520
Hunley: The meeting is a trap.

1039
01:19:41,734 --> 01:19:43,816
The white widow is working with the CIA.

1040
01:19:43,902 --> 01:19:45,438
She has been since the beginning.

1041
01:19:46,322 --> 01:19:49,359
Bargaining for immunity
is her stock-in-trade.

1042
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:51,987
Capturing the plutonium,
and the apostles, and John lark

1043
01:19:52,077 --> 01:19:54,534
buys her a lot of goodwill
with the Americans.

1044
01:19:54,621 --> 01:19:57,488
But if Sloane knew the meeting was
a trap, why didn't she just tell us?

1045
01:19:57,583 --> 01:19:59,686
Hunley: Because, in her mind,
anybody could be John lark,

1046
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:01,450
including one of us.

1047
01:20:02,671 --> 01:20:04,707
And now her suspicions are confirmed.

1048
01:20:07,217 --> 01:20:08,627
According to that dossier,

1049
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:11,176
a trail of electronic evidence
connects hunt

1050
01:20:11,513 --> 01:20:14,425
to the theft of smallpox from the CDC.

1051
01:20:14,516 --> 01:20:16,882
It also links him
to a lengthy correspondence

1052
01:20:16,977 --> 01:20:19,013
ending with the recruitment
of Dr. delbruuk.

1053
01:20:19,104 --> 01:20:21,436
And, of course,
hunt handed over the plutonium

1054
01:20:21,523 --> 01:20:23,354
to the apostles himself.

1055
01:20:23,442 --> 01:20:25,398
Now, those facts, coupled with

1056
01:20:25,486 --> 01:20:28,193
a long and incriminating
history of rogue behavior,

1057
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:30,816
corroborate a CIA narrative

1058
01:20:31,867 --> 01:20:33,698
that hunt has snapped.

1059
01:20:34,203 --> 01:20:36,319
And that his search for lark
is nothing but a cover

1060
01:20:36,413 --> 01:20:38,244
to hide the fact that lark...

1061
01:20:39,333 --> 01:20:40,333
1s me.

1062
01:20:42,586 --> 01:20:44,793
Hunley: I've got to hand it
to you, Ethan.

1063
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:47,212
Normally, when people refer to you
as your own worst enemy,

1064
01:20:47,299 --> 01:20:48,880
it's just a figure of speech.

1065
01:20:53,555 --> 01:20:56,547
I'm afraid Sloane's got
some questions for her as well.

1066
01:20:57,059 --> 01:20:59,721
The widow offered her up
at no extra charge.

1067
01:21:00,229 --> 01:21:02,265
And where did Sloane
get this information?

1068
01:21:03,315 --> 01:21:04,805
Hunley: She didn't say.

1069
01:21:05,192 --> 01:21:07,979
She did, however, Grant me
the opportunity to bring you in,

1070
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:10,231
on the condition that
I terminate this mission

1071
01:21:10,322 --> 01:21:12,688
and hand over
Solomon Lane personally.

1072
01:21:13,158 --> 01:21:14,898
- Sir, you can't do that.
- Hunley: Hunt.

1073
01:21:14,993 --> 01:21:17,530
I know Lane. And he has
no intention of going back.

1074
01:21:17,621 --> 01:21:18,986
That's why we're taking him back.

1075
01:21:19,081 --> 01:21:22,198
Which means that's exactly
what he wants us to do.

1076
01:21:22,292 --> 01:21:23,478
- Ethan...
- Ethan: Sir, what do you

1077
01:21:23,502 --> 01:21:24,662
think this 1s? A coincidence?

1078
01:21:24,753 --> 01:21:25,855
That someone just happened upon this?

1079
01:21:25,879 --> 01:21:28,495
Lane had it sent to her.
He knew how she would react.

1080
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:30,455
Just like he knew
the widow would turn us in.

1081
01:21:30,551 --> 01:21:31,551
Don't you see?

1082
01:21:31,885 --> 01:21:33,375
This, sir...

1083
01:21:33,762 --> 01:21:35,468
This is the trap.

1084
01:21:35,556 --> 01:21:37,421
- We are being directed.
- Hunt!

1085
01:21:37,516 --> 01:21:40,098
There are still two plutonium cores
in the wind!

1086
01:21:40,185 --> 01:21:42,471
And you lost them!

1087
01:21:44,314 --> 01:21:46,930
In fairness, sir, we all lost them.

1088
01:21:47,234 --> 01:21:50,146
Respectfully, sir, you weren't there.

1089
01:21:50,237 --> 01:21:52,728
S0 making excuses for him
is your full-time job now?

1090
01:21:54,241 --> 01:21:57,233
Good god, Ethan, don't make this
any harder than it already is.

1091
01:21:57,661 --> 01:22:00,494
I can no longer protect you,
don't you understand that?

1092
01:22:00,581 --> 01:22:03,323
This is as close as
you're ever gonna get to that plutonium.

1093
01:22:03,417 --> 01:22:05,248
Sir, you don't actually believe this.

1094
01:22:05,335 --> 01:22:07,667
I believe I've been given
a choice to protect you

1095
01:22:07,754 --> 01:22:09,961
or the imf, which is why
I'm bringing you in.

1096
01:22:11,467 --> 01:22:12,798
And if I refuse?

1097
01:22:12,885 --> 01:22:15,046
What do you think he's here for?

1098
01:22:15,137 --> 01:22:16,377
You think he's some observer?

1099
01:22:16,472 --> 01:22:17,928
He's an assassin!

1100
01:22:18,015 --> 01:22:20,552
Erika Sloane's number-one plumber.

1101
01:22:20,642 --> 01:22:23,634
You go rogue, he's authorized
to hunt you down

1102
01:22:24,146 --> 01:22:25,477
and kill you.

1103
01:22:28,901 --> 01:22:31,313
It's the job.
No hard feelings.

1104
01:22:31,695 --> 01:22:33,276
Accept it, Ethan.

1105
01:22:33,363 --> 01:22:35,524
You've lost this one.
What's done is done.

1106
01:22:37,367 --> 01:22:39,449
No, sir. No.

1107
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:42,657
Hunley: I am not asking you.
I am giving you a direct order.

1108
01:22:42,748 --> 01:22:45,364
This mission is terminated.

1109
01:22:46,043 --> 01:22:47,203
Now!

1110
01:22:50,047 --> 01:22:51,412
Stickell, he's your friend.

1111
01:22:51,507 --> 01:22:52,859
Would you please talk
some sense into...

1112
01:22:52,883 --> 01:22:53,963
- (Device hisses)
(Groans)

1113
01:22:55,969 --> 01:22:58,551
I'm sorry, sir,
but you left me no choice.

1114
01:23:00,766 --> 01:23:02,631
There's 15 minutes
before we meet the widow.

1115
01:23:02,726 --> 01:23:04,370
You want the plutonium,
we're the only ones

1116
01:23:04,394 --> 01:23:06,350
who can get it for you. You in or out?

1117
01:23:08,315 --> 01:23:09,315
In.

1118
01:23:09,399 --> 01:23:11,731
- What are you doing?
- Benji needs to get ready.

1119
01:23:11,818 --> 01:23:13,683
- No, Ethan...
- There's no time, Luther.

1120
01:23:13,779 --> 01:23:15,440
I need you to trust me.

1121
01:23:22,204 --> 01:23:23,614
(Device beeping)

1122
01:23:29,753 --> 01:23:30,833
(Exhales)

1123
01:23:32,422 --> 01:23:33,753
You all right?

1124
01:23:34,091 --> 01:23:35,422
Yeah, I just

1125
01:23:35,926 --> 01:23:37,926
(in Lane's voice)
Got a bad feeling about this one.

1126
01:23:59,366 --> 01:24:00,366
(Gate opens)

1127
01:24:03,745 --> 01:24:05,465
- If you don't hear from us...
- (Cocks gun)

1128
01:24:05,831 --> 01:24:07,412
I'll do it my way.

1129
01:24:11,336 --> 01:24:13,167
Ethan: Don't take your eyes off him.

1130
01:24:47,456 --> 01:24:48,456
(Gasps)

1131
01:24:49,708 --> 01:24:51,619
Enough games.
I'm taking you out of here.

1132
01:24:51,710 --> 01:24:53,041
Where's hunt?

1133
01:24:53,545 --> 01:24:55,706
He's gone to the meeting,
with a copy of you.

1134
01:24:55,797 --> 01:24:56,912
Calm down.

1135
01:24:57,007 --> 01:24:58,668
Call the apostles. Warn them.

1136
01:24:58,759 --> 01:25:00,545
I have no way of contacting them.

1137
01:25:00,636 --> 01:25:02,251
For their safety and mine.

1138
01:25:02,346 --> 01:25:03,961
What I do have
is an extraction team with

1139
01:25:04,056 --> 01:25:06,297
satellite overwatch
and a prearranged rendezvous.

1140
01:25:06,391 --> 01:25:07,869
They'll know as soon as
we leave the building.

1141
01:25:07,893 --> 01:25:10,225
No, I'm staying here.

1142
01:25:10,312 --> 01:25:12,177
I haven't finished with hunt yet.

1143
01:25:16,485 --> 01:25:19,727
Why did you have to make this
so fucking complicated?

1144
01:25:20,405 --> 01:25:22,111
I don't understand what you mean.

1145
01:25:22,199 --> 01:25:23,905
The deal was simple.

1146
01:25:23,992 --> 01:25:27,200
I help you frame hunt,
you give me the plutonium.

1147
01:25:27,287 --> 01:25:29,118
You're wasting time.

1148
01:25:29,206 --> 01:25:32,243
"There cannot be peace without
first a great suffering.

1149
01:25:32,668 --> 01:25:35,330
"The greater the suffering,
the greater the peace."

1150
01:25:35,671 --> 01:25:36,786
When I wrote those words,

1151
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:41,123
I wasn't referring to your peace
or hunt's suffering.

1152
01:25:41,218 --> 01:25:43,334
The old world order
needs dismantling,

1153
01:25:43,428 --> 01:25:45,384
and we have the tools
to dismantle it.

1154
01:25:45,472 --> 01:25:47,053
All you seem to care about

1155
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:49,802
is that hunt lives to take the blame.

1156
01:25:49,893 --> 01:25:51,554
That's not anarchy.

1157
01:25:51,645 --> 01:25:53,181
That's revenge.

1158
01:25:53,271 --> 01:25:54,807
Yes, it is.

1159
01:25:55,273 --> 01:25:56,979
And when I have what I want,

1160
01:25:57,859 --> 01:26:00,271
the apostles will give you
the plutonium.

1161
01:26:04,282 --> 01:26:05,863
Hunt's the only friend you've got.

1162
01:26:05,951 --> 01:26:06,986
You're only alive today

1163
01:26:07,077 --> 01:26:09,068
because he didn't have
the guts to kill you.

1164
01:26:09,162 --> 01:26:11,869
Sloane was right.
The imf is Halloween.

1165
01:26:11,957 --> 01:26:14,198
Nothing but grown men wearing...

1166
01:26:21,466 --> 01:26:22,922
What? (Clears throat)

1167
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:28,420
(Panting)

1168
01:26:28,557 --> 01:26:31,469
It's just the job.
No hard feelings.

1169
01:26:33,061 --> 01:26:34,141
(Gun cocks)

1170
01:26:35,605 --> 01:26:37,596
I've ruined your day, haven't I?

1171
01:26:39,192 --> 01:26:41,023
- (Gun clicking) _oh!

1172
01:26:41,236 --> 01:26:43,898
And you were doing so well
up until then.

1173
01:26:44,322 --> 01:26:46,153
Now, I think this one's loaded.

1174
01:26:46,616 --> 01:26:48,356
You want to find out?

1175
01:26:49,578 --> 01:26:50,613
(Grunts)

1176
01:27:30,494 --> 01:27:33,156
- So, how'd I do?
- I never had a doubt.

1177
01:27:34,915 --> 01:27:37,372
I'm beginning to see why
you guys enjoy this so much.

1178
01:27:37,459 --> 01:27:39,199
Hats off, Mr. secretary.

1179
01:27:39,294 --> 01:27:41,910
- The man's a natural.
- Welcome to the team, sir.

1180
01:27:42,881 --> 01:27:44,917
You're making a mistake.

1181
01:27:45,008 --> 01:27:49,342
No, the mistake was mine
when I saved your life over Paris.

1182
01:27:49,429 --> 01:27:52,011
This proves nothing.
I'm playing a role,

1183
01:27:52,098 --> 01:27:54,180
just like you are, trying to
recover that plutonium.

1184
01:27:54,267 --> 01:27:56,804
That doesn't explain why
you gave Sloane the dossier

1185
01:27:56,895 --> 01:27:58,135
and tried to frame hunt.

1186
01:27:58,230 --> 01:27:59,766
He makes a good point,

1187
01:28:00,106 --> 01:28:01,106
lark.

1188
01:28:01,608 --> 01:28:03,769
He's paranoid. Delusional.

1189
01:28:04,110 --> 01:28:05,771
Just like the dossier says.

1190
01:28:05,862 --> 01:28:07,568
So where did Sloane
get the dossier from?

1191
01:28:07,656 --> 01:28:09,647
I have no idea.

1192
01:28:09,741 --> 01:28:11,106
Sloane: (On phone) / do.

1193
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:15,576
Did you get all that, Erika?

1194
01:28:15,664 --> 01:28:17,029
I did.

1195
01:28:17,123 --> 01:28:19,614
I don't appreciate being used, Walker.

1196
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:23,452
Oops. Bad boy.

1197
01:28:24,422 --> 01:28:26,067
Hunley: Where would you
like him delivered?

1198
01:28:26,091 --> 01:28:28,002
I'll come to you.

1199
01:28:30,512 --> 01:28:32,503
Officer: Nobody move! Nobody move!

1200
01:28:32,597 --> 01:28:34,133
Weapons down! Drop 'em!

1201
01:28:34,474 --> 01:28:36,965
Hands in the air!
Weapons down!

1202
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:39,141
Drop it! Drop it!

1203
01:28:39,437 --> 01:28:40,768
Weapons down! Right now! You!

1204
01:28:40,856 --> 01:28:43,393
It's okay. It's okay. It's all right.

1205
01:28:44,317 --> 01:28:45,432
I thought we had a deal.

1206
01:28:46,027 --> 01:28:48,359
We did. And now we don't.

1207
01:28:48,697 --> 01:28:52,030
There is too much at stake here
for me to take any chances.

1208
01:28:52,325 --> 01:28:54,987
I'm bringing you all in,
along with Walker.

1209
01:28:55,161 --> 01:28:56,651
The plutonium is still out there!

1210
01:28:56,872 --> 01:28:59,534
And I don't trust a living soul
in that room to get it.

1211
01:28:59,708 --> 01:29:02,541
We'll sort out who's who in Washington.

1212
01:29:03,461 --> 01:29:04,917
- Erikal
- sir?

1213
01:29:05,422 --> 01:29:07,504
It's all right.
Let's just do what she says.

1214
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,291
The only real threats are in this room,
and we have them.

1215
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:15,970
Do you?

1216
01:29:16,975 --> 01:29:18,055
Go.

1217
01:29:24,941 --> 01:29:25,941
(Lane grunts)

1218
01:29:37,704 --> 01:29:39,285
Where the hell 1s Lane?

1219
01:29:54,012 --> 01:29:55,422
(Both grunting)

1220
01:29:59,225 --> 01:30:00,431
- (Stabs)
(Groaning)

1221
01:30:09,945 --> 01:30:10,945
Luther: Ethan! Ethan!

1222
01:30:35,261 --> 01:30:37,502
First team is down.
Send backup.

1223
01:30:39,766 --> 01:30:41,597
- (Pants and groans)
- Sir!

1224
01:30:42,894 --> 01:30:45,055
Oh, no, no, no.
Man down! Man down!

1225
01:30:47,691 --> 01:30:48,931
Somebody help!

1226
01:30:57,951 --> 01:30:59,111
Sir.

1227
01:30:59,869 --> 01:31:00,949
(Gunfire continues)

1228
01:31:03,623 --> 01:31:06,114
Ethan, I tagged Walker,
but he's on the run.

1229
01:31:06,209 --> 01:31:07,619
You got to get him.

1230
01:31:12,465 --> 01:31:13,625
Go.

1231
01:31:15,176 --> 01:31:16,757
I'm sorry, sir.

1232
01:31:18,638 --> 01:31:19,878
(Weakly) Go.

1233
01:31:20,724 --> 01:31:22,134
(Gunfire continues)

1234
01:31:30,650 --> 01:31:31,810
Ethan?

1235
01:31:36,114 --> 01:31:37,114
Wait!

1236
01:31:38,825 --> 01:31:40,315
Get that son of a bitch.

1237
01:31:47,292 --> 01:31:48,292
(Silenced gunshot)

1238
01:32:09,147 --> 01:32:10,978
- Come on, come on, come on.
- (Beeping)

1239
01:32:11,107 --> 01:32:12,347
Yes! I got him.

1240
01:32:16,654 --> 01:32:18,895
(Officers shouting indistinctly)

1241
01:32:21,576 --> 01:32:23,567
(Choral music playing)

1242
01:32:23,661 --> 01:32:24,821
I'm sorry.

1243
01:32:25,830 --> 01:32:27,866
Talk to me, Benji. Where's Walker?

1244
01:32:27,957 --> 01:32:30,061
Benji. He's about a quarter mile west
if you turn right.

1245
01:32:30,085 --> 01:32:31,666
To my right?

1246
01:32:34,422 --> 01:32:35,912
I can't do that.

1247
01:32:36,174 --> 01:32:37,505
Why not?

1248
01:32:38,176 --> 01:32:39,666
Because I'm being followed.

1249
01:32:40,011 --> 01:32:41,842
What do you mean? By who?

1250
01:32:42,097 --> 01:32:43,587
How do I know?
CIA, apostles...

1251
01:32:43,681 --> 01:32:45,012
What difference does it make?

1252
01:32:45,266 --> 01:32:48,850
(Stammering) Okay, okay, just get
out of there and then go right.

1253
01:32:56,069 --> 01:32:57,980
I am terribly sorry.

1254
01:32:58,321 --> 01:32:59,652
Excuse me.

1255
01:33:14,504 --> 01:33:15,710
(Beeping)

1256
01:33:16,673 --> 01:33:18,209
Why is he running in circles?

1257
01:33:19,759 --> 01:33:21,169
(Panting)

1258
01:33:45,201 --> 01:33:47,841
Okay, you need to cross the street
on your left as soon as you can.

1259
01:33:53,626 --> 01:33:54,832
Ethan, did you copy?

1260
01:33:54,919 --> 01:33:57,205
- Left, go left, now!
- I'm working on it.

1261
01:34:08,558 --> 01:34:10,719
Now go across the street
right in front of you.

1262
01:34:18,151 --> 01:34:20,893
Ethan, he's getting away from you!
You're gonna have to go faster.

1263
01:34:37,253 --> 01:34:38,288
(Grunting)

1264
01:34:40,673 --> 01:34:42,083
(Telephone ringing)

1265
01:34:45,386 --> 01:34:46,922
(Panting)

1266
01:34:52,435 --> 01:34:54,300
You're gaining on him!
Go straight.

1267
01:34:56,773 --> 01:34:58,434
Straight? Keep going straight?

1268
01:34:58,775 --> 01:35:00,766
Go straight, go straight,
straight, straight.

1269
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,730
Okay, now turn right.

1270
01:35:03,988 --> 01:35:04,988
Right?

1271
01:35:05,490 --> 01:35:06,570
Now?

1272
01:35:06,741 --> 01:35:08,356
- Yes, right!
- Are you sure?

1273
01:35:08,534 --> 01:35:09,694
Yes, I'm...

1274
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:11,826
No, it's left! Turn left!

1275
01:35:11,913 --> 01:35:13,778
Sorry, I had the screen-lock on.

1276
01:35:14,958 --> 01:35:16,073
(Pants)

1277
01:35:17,627 --> 01:35:18,958
Left.

1278
01:35:22,423 --> 01:35:23,663
Thank you.

1279
01:35:30,306 --> 01:35:33,298
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm jumping out a window!

1280
01:35:33,393 --> 01:35:35,179
What do you mean,
you're jumping out of a...

1281
01:35:37,313 --> 01:35:39,099
Oh, sorry. I had it in 2d.

1282
01:35:39,399 --> 01:35:40,809
Good luck.

1283
01:35:49,701 --> 01:35:50,736
(Grunts)

1284
01:36:14,642 --> 01:36:16,962
At the end of the bridge,
turn left. You've almost got him.

1285
01:36:21,107 --> 01:36:23,143
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, Ethan, get him!

1286
01:36:23,234 --> 01:36:24,314
You're right on top of him!

1287
01:36:39,292 --> 01:36:40,602
That's it, he's right in front of you!

1288
01:36:40,626 --> 01:36:41,741
Get him! Get him! Get him!

1289
01:37:04,817 --> 01:37:06,648
(Ethan panting)

1290
01:37:09,530 --> 01:37:10,530
(Gun cocks)

1291
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:13,281
(Grunting)

1292
01:37:17,914 --> 01:37:21,406
You can't do it, can you?
Not until you get your plutonium.

1293
01:37:22,335 --> 01:37:25,577
No. He still has plans for you.

1294
01:37:26,672 --> 01:37:29,755
You're gonna turn yourself in
and admit you're John lark,

1295
01:37:30,093 --> 01:37:33,176
then watch the old world implode
from your dark little cell.

1296
01:37:33,262 --> 01:37:34,798
And if I don't?

1297
01:37:40,603 --> 01:37:41,683
(Gasps)

1298
01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:49,396
I'm her guardian angel, hunt.

1299
01:37:51,030 --> 01:37:53,942
If I see you again, she dies.

1300
01:37:54,033 --> 01:37:56,649
If you try to warn her, she dies.

1301
01:37:57,036 --> 01:37:58,321
Know when you're beat.

1302
01:38:04,377 --> 01:38:05,583
(Elevator bell dings)

1303
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:11,960
(Grunting)

1304
01:39:09,859 --> 01:39:11,499
Luther: These are the designs
we recovered

1305
01:39:11,569 --> 01:39:13,730
from Dr. delbruuk's lab in Berlin.

1306
01:39:13,821 --> 01:39:15,903
Benji: That's a five-megaton
nuclear device.

1307
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:17,676
That's greater than
all the explosive energy

1308
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:18,735
released in world war il.

1309
01:39:18,826 --> 01:39:22,489
To disarm it, normally
we'd cut the fuse wire here.

1310
01:39:22,580 --> 01:39:24,036
What, "normally"?

1311
01:39:24,123 --> 01:39:26,956
Walker and Lane
have two plutonium cores,

1312
01:39:27,043 --> 01:39:28,408
meaning two bombs.

1313
01:39:28,753 --> 01:39:31,039
Yeah. And they're both linked
by a microwave fail-safe

1314
01:39:31,130 --> 01:39:32,983
which is accurate to
within one-tenth of a second.

1315
01:39:33,007 --> 01:39:37,171
Any attempt to defuse one bomb
automatically triggers the other.

1316
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:40,303
Meaning once armed,
the bombs cannot be disarmed.

1317
01:39:40,389 --> 01:39:43,051
Benji: The countdown is
started by a remote detonator,

1318
01:39:43,142 --> 01:39:45,133
which 1s also a fail-safe.

1319
01:39:45,228 --> 01:39:47,514
Meaning once the countdown starts,

1320
01:39:48,189 --> 01:39:49,520
it can't be stopped.

1321
01:39:51,108 --> 01:39:53,690
So the solution to this is?

1322
01:39:55,696 --> 01:39:57,186
We're working on it.

1323
01:39:58,783 --> 01:39:59,783
So,

1324
01:40:00,451 --> 01:40:02,863
technically, this is a suicide mission.

1325
01:40:13,965 --> 01:40:14,965
What is it?

1326
01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:17,882
Have a seat. Please.

1327
01:40:21,889 --> 01:40:23,880
In all the years
that I've known Ethan,

1328
01:40:24,225 --> 01:40:26,887
he's only been serious
about two women.

1329
01:40:27,979 --> 01:40:29,719
One was his wife.

1330
01:40:30,481 --> 01:40:31,812
He's married?

1331
01:40:32,024 --> 01:40:34,015
No, he was.

1332
01:40:34,402 --> 01:40:36,142
Was? What happened to her?

1333
01:40:36,487 --> 01:40:37,852
Well, she was taken

1334
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:40,901
by some people
who wanted to get to Ethan.

1335
01:40:41,075 --> 01:40:43,782
It's okay,
he got her back in one piece.

1336
01:40:44,412 --> 01:40:45,948
Then he quit the game.

1337
01:40:46,956 --> 01:40:49,117
They were happy for a while.

1338
01:40:49,584 --> 01:40:52,542
But every time something bad
happened in the world,

1339
01:40:52,712 --> 01:40:55,124
Ethan would think,
"I should've been there."

1340
01:40:55,381 --> 01:40:57,963
And she would wonder,
"who's watching the world

1341
01:40:58,050 --> 01:41:00,041
"while Ethan's watching me?"

1342
01:41:00,469 --> 01:41:03,632
Deep down, they both knew
that someday, somehow,

1343
01:41:03,806 --> 01:41:06,798
something truly terrible
was going to happen

1344
01:41:08,269 --> 01:41:10,476
all because they were together.

1345
01:41:11,564 --> 01:41:12,644
So...

1346
01:41:15,026 --> 01:41:17,768
- Where is she now?
- She's a ghost.

1347
01:41:17,987 --> 01:41:19,318
Good at it, too.

1348
01:41:19,572 --> 01:41:21,233
Taught her myself.

1349
01:41:21,574 --> 01:41:23,940
Every now and then,
she sends up a signal

1350
01:41:24,035 --> 01:41:25,195
to let Ethan know she's safe.

1351
01:41:25,953 --> 01:41:27,864
And that keeps him going.

1352
01:41:29,206 --> 01:41:30,696
Why are you telling me this?

1353
01:41:32,543 --> 01:41:33,658
Hmm.

1354
01:41:34,629 --> 01:41:38,213
We're in this mess because
Ethan wouldn't let me die.

1355
01:41:40,801 --> 01:41:42,166
He's a good man.

1356
01:41:42,803 --> 01:41:46,512
And he cares about you
more than he can admit.

1357
01:41:47,642 --> 01:41:51,305
That's one more worry
than he can handle right now.

1358
01:41:53,898 --> 01:41:55,980
If you care about him,

1359
01:41:56,567 --> 01:41:58,057
you should walk away.

1360
01:42:01,572 --> 01:42:02,937
Luther...

1361
01:42:03,032 --> 01:42:04,522
Ethan: Is everything all right?

1362
01:42:11,582 --> 01:42:12,617
(Sighs softly)

1363
01:42:16,796 --> 01:42:18,502
I'm coming with you.

1364
01:42:27,473 --> 01:42:28,588
I know.

1365
01:42:32,728 --> 01:42:34,093
So how do we find him?

1366
01:42:35,815 --> 01:42:37,476
Microwave transponder.

1367
01:42:37,650 --> 01:42:40,357
Traceable via satellite
anywhere in the world.

1368
01:42:40,695 --> 01:42:42,422
Lane had one of these
in the back of his neck.

1369
01:42:42,446 --> 01:42:43,446
(Rapid beeping)

1370
01:42:43,531 --> 01:42:44,646
We removed it in Paris.

1371
01:42:44,907 --> 01:42:47,068
At the same time,
we put our own transponder in.

1372
01:42:47,243 --> 01:42:48,323
Got it.

1373
01:42:50,287 --> 01:42:52,528
Luther: 36-hour delayed activation,

1374
01:42:52,707 --> 01:42:55,119
in case Lane's apostles scan him.

1375
01:42:55,876 --> 01:42:57,867
So you planned on letting him go.

1376
01:42:58,045 --> 01:43:00,127
Not this way, but yes.

1377
01:43:00,381 --> 01:43:01,917
He's gonna lead us to the plutonium.

1378
01:43:02,216 --> 01:43:03,797
How can you be sure?

1379
01:43:03,968 --> 01:43:06,050
His plan to put me in prison
went to hell.

1380
01:43:07,221 --> 01:43:09,382
Now he's gonna want me there
for the end.

1381
01:43:09,890 --> 01:43:11,471
So when does this transponder activate?

1382
01:43:11,559 --> 01:43:13,161
Benji: I got him. I got him,
I got him, I got him!

1383
01:43:13,185 --> 01:43:15,267
He's traveling east
over Europe at 500 knots.

1384
01:43:15,438 --> 01:43:16,438
Luther: He's airborne.

1385
01:43:16,605 --> 01:43:17,720
Shall we inform the CIA?

1386
01:43:18,315 --> 01:43:19,725
The CIA's been infiltrated.

1387
01:43:19,942 --> 01:43:22,308
I don't trust anybody
outside of this room.

1388
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:24,481
We're gonna have to go it alone.

1389
01:43:27,366 --> 01:43:28,366
So where do we go?

1390
01:43:48,763 --> 01:43:50,094
Ethan: How we doing, Benji?

1391
01:43:50,556 --> 01:43:53,218
If there's a way to defuse these bombs,
I can't find it.

1392
01:43:53,392 --> 01:43:55,633
You'll figure it out.
I know you will.

1393
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:57,100
(Steady beeping)

1394
01:43:57,229 --> 01:43:59,561
Luther: Damn. Ethan, we lost the signal.

1395
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:01,555
Lane must've found our transmitter.

1396
01:44:01,942 --> 01:44:05,275
- What's his last position?
Luther: About 30 miles northeast.

1397
01:44:05,529 --> 01:44:07,520
Then that's where he wants us to go.

1398
01:44:07,698 --> 01:44:09,529
- What's there?
- The nubra river valley.

1399
01:44:09,700 --> 01:44:11,406
There's only a medical camp there.

1400
01:44:11,494 --> 01:44:13,860
Humanitarian aid overseas.

1401
01:44:14,205 --> 01:44:16,947
Why would Lane target a medical camp?

1402
01:44:17,583 --> 01:44:18,583
Smallpox.

1403
01:44:19,251 --> 01:44:20,251
What?

1404
01:44:20,336 --> 01:44:23,578
Smallpox. The apostles triggered
a smallpox outbreak in kashmir.

1405
01:44:24,089 --> 01:44:26,705
Lane must've wanted that camp there
for a reason.

1406
01:44:26,967 --> 01:44:28,298
But what?

1407
01:44:28,844 --> 01:44:30,926
- Oh, my god.
“what is it?

1408
01:44:31,764 --> 01:44:34,847
The nubra river is at the base
of the siachen glacier.

1409
01:44:35,184 --> 01:44:36,744
So a nuclear blast there
would irradiate

1410
01:44:36,769 --> 01:44:39,852
the largest natural irrigation system
in the world.

1411
01:44:40,523 --> 01:44:44,186
Fresh water from the border of
China to India and Pakistan.

1412
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:48,311
They're gonna starve one-third
of the world's population.

1413
01:44:48,489 --> 01:44:49,695
"The greater the suffering..."

1414
01:44:49,949 --> 01:44:51,940
"The greater the peace."

1415
01:44:52,493 --> 01:44:55,326
I still don't understand
why Lane wants a medical camp there.

1416
01:44:55,496 --> 01:44:56,656
Ethan: It doesn't matter.

1417
01:44:56,831 --> 01:44:59,413
All that matters now is we find a way
to defuse those bombs.

1418
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:01,240
Uh, I think I've found it.

1419
01:45:01,585 --> 01:45:03,075
Maybe. Um...

1420
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:05,690
Look, there appears to be a flaw
in the bomb's operating system.

1421
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:08,001
The remote detonator
requires that firing key.

1422
01:45:08,175 --> 01:45:10,507
If we remove that key,
then it should short out

1423
01:45:10,594 --> 01:45:13,006
the fail-safe and allow us
to cut both fuses.

1424
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:14,699
So one of us needs to get the detonator

1425
01:45:14,723 --> 01:45:15,723
and remove that key.

1426
01:45:15,808 --> 01:45:16,843
Benji: Yeah.

1427
01:45:17,017 --> 01:45:19,759
While the rest of us cut the fuses
on both bombs. Simple.

1428
01:45:20,604 --> 01:45:21,889
Yeah, but...

1429
01:45:22,273 --> 01:45:23,604
But what?

1430
01:45:23,899 --> 01:45:26,060
Well, in order to make this work,

1431
01:45:26,151 --> 01:45:28,267
we can't remove the key
or cut the fuses

1432
01:45:28,445 --> 01:45:31,107
until after the countdown starts.

1433
01:45:31,699 --> 01:45:33,439
Ilsa: But Walt,
just so I've got this clear.

1434
01:45:33,617 --> 01:45:36,108
Our only chance
to safely defuse both bombs

1435
01:45:36,203 --> 01:45:38,068
1s to let the countdown start.

1436
01:45:39,039 --> 01:45:41,530
And then remove that key.

1437
01:45:49,633 --> 01:45:50,964
Okay.

1438
01:46:03,689 --> 01:46:04,769
(Whirring)

1439
01:46:07,735 --> 01:46:08,895
(Beeping)

1440
01:46:09,028 --> 01:46:12,361
Lane: Both devices are now
connected to the detonator.

1441
01:46:13,449 --> 01:46:15,405
Fifteen minutes should
give you enough time

1442
01:46:15,492 --> 01:46:17,574
to reach minimum safe distance.

1443
01:46:19,997 --> 01:46:22,158
My running days are over.

1444
01:46:23,083 --> 01:46:25,324
This is where it ends for me.

1445
01:46:51,862 --> 01:46:53,272
(Device beeping)

1446
01:46:53,989 --> 01:46:56,071
I'm getting signals all over the place.

1447
01:46:56,241 --> 01:46:59,608
We're at a medical camp.
X-ray machines, cat scanners,

1448
01:46:59,703 --> 01:47:01,103
radiological signatures everywhere.

1449
01:47:01,246 --> 01:47:02,736
It's like a needle in a haystack.

1450
01:47:02,831 --> 01:47:04,787
Process of elimination, one at a time.

1451
01:47:04,875 --> 01:47:06,661
Let's split up. Stay on comms.

1452
01:47:08,420 --> 01:47:09,830
(Beeping continues)

1453
01:47:12,758 --> 01:47:14,749
(Indistinct announcements over pa)

1454
01:47:17,012 --> 01:47:18,047
Julia: Ethan?

1455
01:47:23,894 --> 01:47:24,974
Julia?

1456
01:47:29,858 --> 01:47:31,143
Is that...

1457
01:47:35,406 --> 01:47:36,486
Man: Julia!

1458
01:47:38,409 --> 01:47:39,740
Does he know?

1459
01:47:40,911 --> 01:47:41,911
Man: Hey.

1460
01:47:42,621 --> 01:47:44,703
Uh, this is my husband, Erik.

1461
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:46,120
Uh, this is...

1462
01:47:46,208 --> 01:47:47,869
rob. rob Thorne.
Dr. rob Thorne.

1463
01:47:48,627 --> 01:47:50,618
- L worked with Julia...
- At mass general.

1464
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:52,380
Before New York.

1465
01:47:52,464 --> 01:47:53,795
Oh, you're kidding. (Chuckles)

1466
01:47:53,966 --> 01:47:55,706
- What a coincidence!
- L know. I...

1467
01:47:55,884 --> 01:47:57,715
- What brings you all this way?
- L was, uh...

1468
01:47:57,886 --> 01:47:59,797
I was in turtuk, not far from here

1469
01:48:00,055 --> 01:48:02,546
and heard help was needed.

1470
01:48:02,808 --> 01:48:03,808
Oh, well,

1471
01:48:03,976 --> 01:48:05,932
actually we're just about finished here.

1472
01:48:06,020 --> 01:48:08,477
The whole village is inoculated.
But, uh...

1473
01:48:09,064 --> 01:48:10,804
What were you doing out in turtuk?

1474
01:48:11,483 --> 01:48:12,973
rob's on vacation.

1475
01:48:13,152 --> 01:48:15,814
No. No, I'm... I'm working.

1476
01:48:18,198 --> 01:48:19,859
You're a long way from home.

1477
01:48:20,117 --> 01:48:22,233
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks to our guardian angel.

1478
01:48:23,037 --> 01:48:24,037
Guardian?

1479
01:48:24,288 --> 01:48:25,932
Well, yeah. We were
running a field hospital

1480
01:48:25,956 --> 01:48:28,038
outside of Darfur when
the outbreak happened here.

1481
01:48:28,208 --> 01:48:29,310
And here comes this phone call

1482
01:48:29,334 --> 01:48:30,995
from an anonymous donor,
out of the blue.

1483
01:48:31,795 --> 01:48:33,273
And, uh, he says
he's ready to underwrite

1484
01:48:33,297 --> 01:48:35,788
the entire operation. One condition.

1485
01:48:36,258 --> 01:48:37,748
We run the whole thing.

1486
01:48:37,968 --> 01:48:39,799
Erik: (Chuckles softly)
Can you believe that?

1487
01:48:40,971 --> 01:48:42,461
I certainly can.

1488
01:48:42,890 --> 01:48:44,380
Yeah. Out of the blue.

1489
01:48:44,558 --> 01:48:45,968
Out of the blue.

1490
01:48:48,479 --> 01:48:49,969
That's quite a full life.

1491
01:48:50,147 --> 01:48:52,138
Yeah, you know, before Julia,
I never traveled.

1492
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:54,060
- (Beeping)
- I never even left New York.

1493
01:48:54,234 --> 01:48:55,920
- Never left the hospital.
- (Beeping intensifies)

1494
01:48:55,944 --> 01:48:58,481
Seven days a week,
dusk till dawn. No vacations.

1495
01:48:58,655 --> 01:49:00,145
Ethan, I think I found something.

1496
01:49:02,284 --> 01:49:03,569
Heart attack at 55.

1497
01:49:03,744 --> 01:49:06,656
And she convinced me
to let it all go.

1498
01:49:07,331 --> 01:49:08,992
Help where it's needed most.

1499
01:49:09,166 --> 01:49:11,202
So we've been on the go ever since,

1500
01:49:11,502 --> 01:49:13,333
and I've never been more fulfilled.

1501
01:49:14,505 --> 01:49:16,166
I'm happy for you.

1502
01:49:17,257 --> 01:49:18,417
Erik: Thank you.

1503
01:49:20,427 --> 01:49:22,133
- Well, we should get going.
- Erik: Oh.

1504
01:49:22,221 --> 01:49:23,586
We have a lot of packing to do.

1505
01:49:23,680 --> 01:49:25,762
Oh, no, I'll handle that.
You two should catch up.

1506
01:49:25,849 --> 01:49:27,510
Oh, no, I should
get out of your hair.

1507
01:49:27,684 --> 01:49:29,724
(Chuckles) Are you kidding?
You should stick around.

1508
01:49:29,853 --> 01:49:32,060
I'm just sorry you came
all this way for nothing.

1509
01:49:32,856 --> 01:49:33,891
Um...

1510
01:49:34,316 --> 01:49:36,648
Tell you what, we'll pack,

1511
01:49:36,944 --> 01:49:38,855
and why don't we give you
a ride back to turtuk,

1512
01:49:38,946 --> 01:49:41,437
you two can catch up
in the car? Yeah?

1513
01:49:41,907 --> 01:49:43,397
You're very kind.

1514
01:49:44,326 --> 01:49:46,658
Settled. See you soon.

1515
01:49:46,745 --> 01:49:48,110
(Indistinct announcements over pa)

1516
01:49:48,205 --> 01:49:49,695
It was good to see you. (Chuckles)

1517
01:49:50,999 --> 01:49:53,832
(Whispers) I am so sorry, Julia.
I'm so sorry.

1518
01:50:09,101 --> 01:50:10,511
(Indistinct chatter)

1519
01:50:15,107 --> 01:50:17,018
Take both helicopters.

1520
01:50:18,193 --> 01:50:19,854
No one else leaves.

1521
01:50:27,953 --> 01:50:29,614
Benji: Careful, careful, careful.

1522
01:50:34,376 --> 01:50:35,376
Luther: It's armed.

1523
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:36,940
But the countdown hasn't started yet.

1524
01:50:37,004 --> 01:50:38,773
The network signal's strong,
which means the other device

1525
01:50:38,797 --> 01:50:40,333
is close by and the detonator.

1526
01:50:40,507 --> 01:50:42,839
About half a k in that direction.

1527
01:50:44,052 --> 01:50:45,462
They're still here.

1528
01:50:46,930 --> 01:50:48,170
Luther, you keep working on it.

1529
01:50:48,223 --> 01:50:49,338
You two, come with me.

1530
01:50:50,976 --> 01:50:53,308
Oh, sure. I got this.

1531
01:50:53,729 --> 01:50:55,720
Don't worry about old Luther.

1532
01:51:17,961 --> 01:51:18,961
(Beeping)

1533
01:51:29,765 --> 01:51:31,096
Ethan: Walker.

1534
01:51:35,103 --> 01:51:36,593
(Beeping)

1535
01:51:36,772 --> 01:51:37,772
Luther: Damn.

1536
01:51:37,981 --> 01:51:39,312
Ethan, the countdown has started!

1537
01:51:39,399 --> 01:51:40,479
We have 15 minufes.

1538
01:51:40,651 --> 01:51:42,312
Walker has the detonator.

1539
01:51:46,073 --> 01:51:47,073
(Engine starts)

1540
01:51:52,079 --> 01:51:53,194
Come on, come on!

1541
01:51:55,415 --> 01:51:56,825
We have to evacuate these people.

1542
01:51:56,917 --> 01:51:57,917
There's no time.

1543
01:51:58,085 --> 01:52:00,326
This whole valley's gonna be
incinerated in 15 minutes.

1544
01:52:04,341 --> 01:52:05,456
Ilsa: It's too late!

1545
01:52:05,717 --> 01:52:06,752
Ethan: No.

1546
01:52:07,052 --> 01:52:08,337
I'm gonna get the detonator.

1547
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:10,551
- What? How?
- I'll figure it out.

1548
01:52:11,598 --> 01:52:13,589
Find Lane!
Find the other bomb!

1549
01:52:14,851 --> 01:52:17,211
- [ What the hell is he doing?
- ] Find it best not to look.

1550
01:52:49,386 --> 01:52:50,876
(Devices beeping)

1551
01:52:52,764 --> 01:52:53,844
How we doing, Luther?

1552
01:52:54,057 --> 01:52:55,910
Tripwires everywhere.
I don't have enough hands.

1553
01:52:55,934 --> 01:52:57,049
Benji: Just make it happen.

1554
01:52:57,227 --> 01:52:58,262
Luther: Where's Ethan?

1555
01:52:58,353 --> 01:52:59,889
He's gone after the detonator.

1556
01:53:00,063 --> 01:53:01,394
Wait, where's the detonator?

1557
01:53:01,690 --> 01:53:03,100
(Beeping)

1558
01:53:11,825 --> 01:53:12,825
(Grunts)

1559
01:53:21,001 --> 01:53:22,001
(Gasps)

1560
01:53:37,768 --> 01:53:39,224
(Beeping)

1561
01:53:39,353 --> 01:53:40,559
Julia: Luther.

1562
01:53:41,271 --> 01:53:43,307
Julia. You shouldn't be here.

1563
01:53:43,482 --> 01:53:44,562
Oh, my god.

1564
01:53:45,233 --> 01:53:46,473
Oh, my god.

1565
01:53:46,902 --> 01:53:48,022
Is that what I think it 187?

1566
01:53:48,111 --> 01:53:49,647
Benji: Luther, get her out of there!

1567
01:53:49,988 --> 01:53:51,649
Where is she gonna go?

1568
01:53:51,740 --> 01:53:53,230
(Breathing heavily)

1569
01:53:53,325 --> 01:53:54,656
What can I do?

1570
01:53:56,828 --> 01:53:58,819
In the kit,
the pliers with the red grip.

1571
01:53:58,997 --> 01:54:01,534
- Benji: Are you insane?
- Mind your business, Benji.

1572
01:54:01,708 --> 01:54:03,448
This is my business!

1573
01:54:30,779 --> 01:54:32,189
(Grunting)

1574
01:55:09,234 --> 01:55:10,440
(Grunting)

1575
01:55:17,117 --> 01:55:19,073
- (Groans)
(Alarm blaring)

1576
01:55:22,581 --> 01:55:23,616
(Screams)

1577
01:55:37,637 --> 01:55:38,752
(Alarm stops)

1578
01:55:46,021 --> 01:55:47,511
Ethan: Benji, do you copy?

1579
01:55:47,689 --> 01:55:49,429
Ethan! Ethan, where are you?

1580
01:55:49,774 --> 01:55:51,127
I'm in a helicopter going after Walker.

1581
01:55:51,151 --> 01:55:52,186
Hold on.

1582
01:55:52,652 --> 01:55:53,963
How did you get in the helicopter?

1583
01:55:53,987 --> 01:55:55,227
What, you can fly a helicopter?

1584
01:55:55,447 --> 01:55:56,687
Did you say helicopter?

1585
01:55:56,781 --> 01:55:58,942
What the hell are you doing
in a helicopter?

1586
01:55:59,117 --> 01:56:01,699
(Stammers) Just... hey, hey...
Did you find the other bomb?

1587
01:56:01,870 --> 01:56:03,576
We're still looking,
but finding the bomb

1588
01:56:03,663 --> 01:56:05,583
is not gonna matter
unless we have the detonator.

1589
01:56:05,624 --> 01:56:07,489
I know. I know.
I'll get it. I'll get it!

1590
01:56:07,876 --> 01:56:09,867
Benji: Uh, if he's in
another helicopter,

1591
01:56:10,545 --> 01:56:12,706
- how are you gonna get it?
- I'll figure it out.

1592
01:56:12,964 --> 01:56:14,625
You find the bomb,
I'll get the detonator.

1593
01:56:14,716 --> 01:56:16,047
I won't let you down.

1594
01:56:17,344 --> 01:56:18,675
I won't let you down.

1595
01:56:19,137 --> 01:56:21,549
- Be ready.
- Look, Ethan. Ethan!

1596
01:56:21,890 --> 01:56:23,801
- (Voice breaking up)
- Ethan, come in!

1597
01:56:24,184 --> 01:56:26,345
Benji? Benji? Luther?

1598
01:56:27,312 --> 01:56:28,643
Anybody?

1599
01:56:30,106 --> 01:56:31,437
I can do this. I can do this.

1600
01:56:32,067 --> 01:56:33,147
What do we got here?

1601
01:56:33,235 --> 01:56:34,315
We've got airspeed.

1602
01:56:35,153 --> 01:56:36,484
Airspeed.

1603
01:56:36,988 --> 01:56:38,819
Okay, power. This is power.

1604
01:56:39,074 --> 01:56:40,074
(Loud crash)

1605
01:56:45,497 --> 01:56:48,409
Payload. How do I get rid
of this payload?

1606
01:56:56,758 --> 01:56:58,168
Power.

1607
01:57:08,103 --> 01:57:09,513
(Beeping)

1608
01:57:12,524 --> 01:57:13,918
- Luther: Wire strippers.
- (Beeping)

1609
01:57:13,942 --> 01:57:15,478
I'm a doctor, not an electrician.

1610
01:57:15,569 --> 01:57:17,105
Sorry, the thing
with the green grip.

1611
01:57:17,654 --> 01:57:19,315
- Got it.
- The wire in my left hand.

1612
01:57:19,698 --> 01:57:21,529
- The black one?
- My left hand.

1613
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:24,032
- That's your left hand.
- Sorry, the other wire.

1614
01:57:24,202 --> 01:57:25,237
The red one?

1615
01:57:25,328 --> 01:57:26,639
Yes, the red one in my right hand.

1616
01:57:26,663 --> 01:57:27,823
Just checking.

1617
01:57:28,081 --> 01:57:29,571
Oh, I like her.

1618
01:57:42,721 --> 01:57:44,052
Hold this for me, will you?

1619
01:57:46,808 --> 01:57:47,808
Holy shit!

1620
01:57:52,731 --> 01:57:53,731
Damn it!

1621
01:57:55,066 --> 01:57:56,476
Get up there!

1622
01:58:04,826 --> 01:58:06,157
That's right,

1623
01:58:06,578 --> 01:58:07,578
prick.

1624
01:58:16,379 --> 01:58:17,664
Oh, shit!

1625
01:58:24,554 --> 01:58:25,554
Son of a bitch.

1626
01:58:28,642 --> 01:58:29,642
All right.

1627
01:58:32,187 --> 01:58:33,222
Whoa!

1628
01:58:36,566 --> 01:58:38,272
(Alarm blaring)

1629
01:58:38,443 --> 01:58:39,808
Whoa, whoa, too much. Too much.

1630
01:58:40,737 --> 01:58:42,068
Oh, shit!

1631
01:58:42,781 --> 01:58:44,521
Automated voice: Pull up. Pull up.

1632
01:58:45,033 --> 01:58:48,946
- (Grunts)
- Terrain. Terrain. Pull up.

1633
01:58:49,204 --> 01:58:51,115
- Pull up.
- I'm trying, I'm trying!

1634
01:58:51,289 --> 01:58:53,120
Terrain. Terrain.

1635
01:59:04,427 --> 01:59:05,633
(Shouts)

1636
01:59:10,975 --> 01:59:12,340
Benji, I'm not finding anything.

1637
01:59:12,435 --> 01:59:14,141
I think we're looking
in the wrong place.

1638
01:59:14,479 --> 01:59:15,764
Signatures everywhere.

1639
01:59:15,855 --> 01:59:17,291
This is the perfect place to hide it.

1640
01:59:17,315 --> 01:59:20,307
That's the point. I know Lane.
If we're looking here,

1641
01:59:21,319 --> 01:59:23,310
it's because he wants us to.

1642
01:59:23,405 --> 01:59:24,565
(Beeping continues)

1643
01:59:25,782 --> 01:59:27,113
I'm heading to the village.

1644
01:59:27,283 --> 01:59:29,023
Just wait for me, all right?

1645
01:59:29,119 --> 01:59:30,529
(High-pitched whining)

1646
01:59:31,413 --> 01:59:34,155
Uh... Lisa, I think
I've found something.

1647
01:59:38,336 --> 01:59:40,668
Cut this wire right here.

1648
01:59:41,923 --> 01:59:45,131
Turn that screw counterclockwise,
very slowly.

1649
01:59:45,218 --> 01:59:46,218
Got it.

1650
01:59:48,930 --> 01:59:50,010
So...

1651
01:59:52,016 --> 01:59:53,347
How is he?

1652
01:59:53,518 --> 01:59:55,975
Oh, you know. Same old Ethan.

1653
02:00:05,238 --> 02:00:06,238
(Exhales) Jesus!

1654
02:00:10,326 --> 02:00:11,691
- Oh, shit!
(Alarm blaring)

1655
02:00:11,953 --> 02:00:13,489
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1656
02:00:21,921 --> 02:00:24,503
- Benji, I see Lane.
“what? Where?

1657
02:00:24,674 --> 02:00:26,354
He's in a house
at the edge of the village.

1658
02:00:26,384 --> 02:00:27,999
All right, just wait for me, okay?

1659
02:00:28,344 --> 02:00:29,675
Lisa, wait for me!

1660
02:00:39,898 --> 02:00:41,138
No.

1661
02:00:41,232 --> 02:00:42,642
(Rapid beeping)

1662
02:00:44,152 --> 02:00:45,312
(Exhales sharply)

1663
02:00:45,779 --> 02:00:47,269
(Grunts) Nuclear bomb.

1664
02:00:52,076 --> 02:00:53,282
(Grunts)

1665
02:00:58,458 --> 02:00:59,458
Damn it!

1666
02:01:02,086 --> 02:01:03,917
- (Baby crying)
(Breathing heavily)

1667
02:01:07,425 --> 02:01:08,460
(Grunts)

1668
02:01:41,125 --> 02:01:42,661
(Rapid beeping)

1669
02:01:42,794 --> 02:01:44,625
Benji, I found the other bomb.

1670
02:01:45,255 --> 02:01:46,495
Lisa, where are you?

1671
02:01:46,673 --> 02:01:47,958
I'm in a house...

1672
02:01:48,049 --> 02:01:49,164
(Ilsa grunting)

1673
02:01:56,641 --> 02:01:58,006
(Alarm blaring)

1674
02:02:10,655 --> 02:02:12,816
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1675
02:02:13,157 --> 02:02:14,738
You're out of your mind!

1676
02:02:14,826 --> 02:02:16,407
I don't know what's down there.

1677
02:02:20,707 --> 02:02:22,322
Pull up, pull up!

1678
02:02:31,843 --> 02:02:34,175
This crazy son of a bitch
is trying to ram us!

1679
02:02:34,345 --> 02:02:35,676
Gol

1680
02:02:45,857 --> 02:02:47,347
(gun clicking)

1681
02:02:51,404 --> 02:02:52,735
(Panting)

1682
02:02:52,864 --> 02:02:53,864
Shit!

1683
02:02:54,365 --> 02:02:55,696
Luther: Benji, come in.

1684
02:02:55,867 --> 02:02:57,027
We're almost at the fuse.

1685
02:03:00,413 --> 02:03:02,404
Did you just say "other bomb"?

1686
02:03:02,582 --> 02:03:05,164
- Luther: Benji, do you read me?
- I'm working on it!

1687
02:03:05,501 --> 02:03:07,082
Lisa, where are you?

1688
02:03:10,840 --> 02:03:12,580
(Device beeping rapidly)

1689
02:03:13,843 --> 02:03:15,003
(Groans softly)

1690
02:03:18,848 --> 02:03:20,509
(Choking)

1691
02:03:25,229 --> 02:03:27,060
- (Gasps)
- You can't stop it.

1692
02:03:27,523 --> 02:03:30,390
Do you understand?
There's nothing he can do.

1693
02:03:30,735 --> 02:03:31,941
When the clock runs out,

1694
02:03:32,028 --> 02:03:33,768
Ethan hunt will lose everything

1695
02:03:34,948 --> 02:03:36,358
and everyone

1696
02:03:37,533 --> 02:03:39,364
he ever cared about.

1697
02:03:40,662 --> 02:03:42,027
- Benji: Lisa!
(Grunts)

1698
02:03:42,121 --> 02:03:43,121
Benji!

1699
02:03:43,247 --> 02:03:44,327
Benji!

1700
02:03:44,415 --> 02:03:46,155
Benji: Lisa, where are you?

1701
02:03:47,502 --> 02:03:49,163
You don't want to see this.

1702
02:03:50,922 --> 02:03:52,082
Benji!

1703
02:03:52,256 --> 02:03:53,996
- Llsa!
- Ilsa: Benji!

1704
02:03:54,592 --> 02:03:56,298
Benji! Benji, stop!

1705
02:03:57,053 --> 02:03:58,884
(Muffled shouting)

1706
02:04:00,974 --> 02:04:02,180
(Benji grunting)

1707
02:04:05,853 --> 02:04:06,853
(Grunts)

1708
02:04:10,441 --> 02:04:11,851

(Both grunting)

1710
02:04:25,623 --> 02:04:26,738
Benji!

1711
02:04:33,715 --> 02:04:34,715
(Grunts)

1712
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:43,880
(Alarm beeping)

1713
02:04:53,693 --> 02:04:55,183
Oh, no, no, no!

1714
02:04:56,362 --> 02:04:57,977
(Groaning)

1715
02:05:02,702 --> 02:05:03,908

(Gasping)

1719
02:05:33,691 --> 02:05:35,022
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1720
02:05:38,488 --> 02:05:39,715
No, no.
Not when I'm this close.

1721
02:05:39,739 --> 02:05:41,604
Not when I'm this close.
Come on, come on!

1722
02:05:46,537 --> 02:05:47,617
(Grunting)

1723
02:05:51,542 --> 02:05:52,748

(Both grunting)

1731
02:07:20,923 --> 02:07:22,914
(Gasping and coughing)

1732
02:07:28,139 --> 02:07:29,139
Thank you.

1733
02:07:29,432 --> 02:07:30,763
Tie him up.

1734
02:07:31,142 --> 02:07:32,257
(Beeping)

1735
02:07:36,564 --> 02:07:37,974
(Metal creaking)

1736
02:07:40,860 --> 02:07:42,145
(Grunting)

1737
02:07:56,292 --> 02:07:57,702
(Ethan grunting)

1738
02:08:11,057 --> 02:08:12,092
(Yells)

1739
02:08:14,227 --> 02:08:16,058
(Screaming)

1740
02:08:26,864 --> 02:08:28,274
(Both grunting)

1741
02:08:30,618 --> 02:08:32,574
(Beeping)

1742
02:08:34,205 --> 02:08:36,321
Why won't you just die?

1743
02:08:41,295 --> 02:08:42,876
(Both grunting)

1744
02:08:57,395 --> 02:08:58,510
(Beeping)

1745
02:08:58,646 --> 02:09:00,637
Luther: There's nothing else you can do.

1746
02:09:02,316 --> 02:09:04,227
Go be with your husband.

1747
02:09:05,486 --> 02:09:06,817
Luther...

1748
02:09:07,321 --> 02:09:08,401
Go.

1749
02:09:21,669 --> 02:09:22,669
Benji, where are you?

1750
02:09:23,254 --> 02:09:25,094
Okay, Luther, we're inside.
Tell us what to do.

1751
02:09:25,172 --> 02:09:27,584
You should see the red wire
attached to the motherboard.

1752
02:09:27,675 --> 02:09:28,675
Yeah.

1753
02:09:28,759 --> 02:09:29,987
You need to cut that
and the green wire

1754
02:09:30,011 --> 02:09:32,002
next to it simultaneously.

1755
02:09:32,346 --> 02:09:33,677
- Okay, ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

1756
02:09:33,848 --> 02:09:34,848
- Set?
- Mmm-hmm.

1757
02:09:34,932 --> 02:09:37,014
- Cut.
- (Exhales)

1758
02:09:37,351 --> 02:09:39,683
I told you. It can't be stopped.

1759
02:09:40,021 --> 02:09:42,012
There's nothing you can do.

1760
02:09:51,657 --> 02:09:52,988
(Panting)

1761
02:09:55,077 --> 02:09:56,613

1772
02:12:34,028 --> 02:12:35,859
(Breathing heavily)

1773
02:12:58,844 --> 02:13:00,004
(Rapid beeping)

1774
02:13:00,095 --> 02:13:03,178
Benji, listen. Turn the screw
counterclockwise.

1775
02:13:03,349 --> 02:13:04,349
Yep.

1776
02:13:05,476 --> 02:13:07,076
Luther: Remove that panel and you'll see

1777
02:13:07,102 --> 02:13:08,967
the power and ground wires
for the fuse.

1778
02:13:09,063 --> 02:13:10,063
Got it.

1779
02:13:10,231 --> 02:13:12,017
When the time comes,
cut the green wire.

1780
02:13:12,107 --> 02:13:13,722
Do not cut it yet.

1781
02:13:13,901 --> 02:13:14,936
Okay. We copy.

1782
02:13:20,449 --> 02:13:22,861
Ethan, if you can hear me,
we're ready to make the cut.

1783
02:13:23,744 --> 02:13:25,200
Ethan, come in.

1784
02:13:25,496 --> 02:13:28,078
Benji, how do we know
if he's got the key?

1785
02:13:28,541 --> 02:13:29,997
Luther: He'll get it.

1786
02:13:30,167 --> 02:13:32,579
- Yeah, but how do we know?
- He'll get it done!

1787
02:13:38,467 --> 02:13:40,549
We're out of time.
We just have to hope he has it.

1788
02:13:40,719 --> 02:13:42,710
- Okay, we're ready.
“at two seconds we cut.

1789
02:13:42,888 --> 02:13:44,408
Wait, wait, wait! Why two?
Why not one?

1790
02:13:44,557 --> 02:13:45,757
You want to cut it that close?

1791
02:13:45,808 --> 02:13:47,118
It's a second we'll never get back.

1792
02:13:47,142 --> 02:13:48,245
Can we make a decision on this?

1793
02:13:48,269 --> 02:13:49,704
All right, all right!
We'll do it on one.

1794
02:13:49,728 --> 02:13:50,728
Cutting on one?

1795
02:13:50,813 --> 02:13:52,013
Yes, one. All right, stand by.

1796
02:13:54,191 --> 02:13:55,191
Three...

1797
02:13:55,776 --> 02:13:57,687
- Two...
Luther: One.

1798
02:13:57,903 --> 02:13:59,143
- Now!
- (Benji grunts)

1799
02:14:10,416 --> 02:14:11,906
(Panting)

1800
02:14:18,215 --> 02:14:19,751
(Whirring)

1801
02:14:24,763 --> 02:14:26,719
- (Whirring)
(Rapid beeping)

1802
02:14:37,192 --> 02:14:38,853
Okay. (Exhales)

1803
02:14:42,364 --> 02:14:43,444
(Grunts)

1804
02:14:46,869 --> 02:14:48,075
(Exhales deeply)

1805
02:14:49,622 --> 02:14:51,032
My man.

1806
02:15:32,498 --> 02:15:33,533
(Inaudible)

1807
02:15:38,003 --> 02:15:39,334
Julia: Ethan?

1808
02:15:41,674 --> 02:15:42,834
Ethan?

1809
02:15:43,884 --> 02:15:45,420
Can you hear me?

1810
02:15:49,264 --> 02:15:50,754
Can you hear me?

1811
02:15:54,436 --> 02:15:56,176
Erik: No. Don't, don't, don't.

1812
02:15:57,106 --> 02:15:58,437
Don't try to move.

1813
02:15:58,857 --> 02:16:01,143
Don't move.
You're pretty banged up.

1814
02:16:04,113 --> 02:16:05,944
You're a lucky man.

1815
02:16:06,031 --> 02:16:08,443
It's a miracle that crash
didn't kill you, Dr. Thorne.

1816
02:16:08,784 --> 02:16:10,428
If your friend didn't find you
an hour later,

1817
02:16:10,452 --> 02:16:11,652
you would've died of exposure.

1818
02:16:12,079 --> 02:16:13,944
- My friends?
Yeah.

1819
02:16:16,542 --> 02:16:18,533
She got here
not long after you left.

1820
02:16:19,294 --> 02:16:21,706
Right in front of half
the Indian army.

1821
02:16:22,214 --> 02:16:24,705
Can you give us
a few minutes, please?

1822
02:16:26,635 --> 02:16:28,717
See you later, doc.

1823
02:16:35,144 --> 02:16:36,475
Julia...

1824
02:16:37,813 --> 02:16:38,893
I'm sorry.

1825
02:16:39,732 --> 02:16:41,393
There's no reason to be sorry.

1826
02:16:41,483 --> 02:16:42,483
No.

1827
02:16:42,735 --> 02:16:44,396
I'm sorry

1828
02:16:45,654 --> 02:16:47,645
for everything. I...

1829
02:16:49,241 --> 02:16:50,572
Look at me.

1830
02:16:51,493 --> 02:16:52,824
Look at me.

1831
02:16:53,287 --> 02:16:54,948
Look at my life.

1832
02:16:56,623 --> 02:17:00,115
I love what I do,
and I never would have

1833
02:17:00,210 --> 02:17:01,620
found this if I hadn't met you.

1834
02:17:02,796 --> 02:17:05,128
And everything that happened,

1835
02:17:05,883 --> 02:17:08,716
it taught me who I am.
It showed me

1836
02:17:08,927 --> 02:17:11,509
what I am capable of, and I...

1837
02:17:12,181 --> 02:17:13,967
I am a survivor.

1838
02:17:14,516 --> 02:17:16,177
But what happened here,

1839
02:17:17,561 --> 02:17:19,392
- it was my...
- Nothing happened.

1840
02:17:19,563 --> 02:17:21,554
Because you were here.

1841
02:17:23,650 --> 02:17:26,983
And I sleep soundly at night
knowing you always will be.

1842
02:17:27,821 --> 02:17:28,856
(Sighs)

1843
02:17:36,288 --> 02:17:37,619
You're happy?

1844
02:17:37,873 --> 02:17:39,113
Very.

1845
02:17:42,294 --> 02:17:44,706
I'm exactly where I should be.

1846
02:17:47,049 --> 02:17:48,710
And so are you.

1847
02:18:22,793 --> 02:18:23,793
(Inaudible)

1848
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:29,296
Sloane: Per your request,

1849
02:18:30,926 --> 02:18:34,839
I'm handing Solomon Lane
back to MI6.

1850
02:18:38,725 --> 02:18:41,216
Through a broker, of course.

1851
02:18:43,397 --> 02:18:46,389
Part of our ongoing arrangement.

1852
02:18:51,321 --> 02:18:53,562
After what happened in Paris,

1853
02:18:54,074 --> 02:18:56,736
we prefer to keep a low profile.

1854
02:18:58,745 --> 02:19:03,205
And that closes your friend's account
with British intelligence.

1855
02:19:03,375 --> 02:19:04,740
(Chuckles)

1856
02:19:05,252 --> 02:19:07,413
The ribs. Watch the ribs.

1857
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:11,372
Sloane: I understand now
why hunley believed in you.

1858
02:19:12,050 --> 02:19:14,382
The world needs the imf.

1859
02:19:15,053 --> 02:19:17,214
We need people like you

1860
02:19:17,556 --> 02:19:19,046
who care about the one life

1861
02:19:20,309 --> 02:19:23,221
as much as they care about
the millions.

1862
02:19:24,980 --> 02:19:26,311
That way

1863
02:19:26,565 --> 02:19:28,226
I hever have fo.

1864
02:19:29,067 --> 02:19:30,307
You okay?

1865
02:19:31,486 --> 02:19:33,067
You've never looked better.

1866
02:19:33,155 --> 02:19:35,396
- (Scoffs) Don't. Please.
- (Chuckles)

1867
02:19:36,325 --> 02:19:37,610
How close were we?

1868
02:19:40,495 --> 02:19:41,495
The usual.

1869
02:19:43,707 --> 02:19:44,787
(Chuckles)

1870
02:19:45,959 --> 02:19:47,870
The usual? (Laughing)

1871
02:19:49,254 --> 02:19:50,960
Please don't make me laugh.

1872
02:19:51,340 --> 02:19:53,331
(Mission: Impossible theme playing)
