1
00:01:00,174 --> 00:01:04,174
I have learned to become more forgiving
and more tolerant of people,

2
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:07,933
because when we think that in
each of us there is something that suffers,

3
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:10,943
a child that cries, we become
more indulgent and tolerant.

4
00:01:11,144 --> 00:01:14,147
I think that the heart is something
very important,

5
00:01:14,172 --> 00:01:16,980
and that we we have to always
speak and see with our heart,

6
00:01:17,005 --> 00:01:20,838
as Saint-Exupéry said,
"We see clearly only with the heart."

7
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:45,126
We go on vacation!

8
00:01:45,657 --> 00:01:47,573
Come on, let's go on vacation!

9
00:01:47,727 --> 00:01:49,894
Gently, Marie, with your suitcase.

10
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,288
- It's going to be great!
- Long live the vacation

11
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:54,541
Long live the vacation!

12
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:56,497
Alice!

13
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,999
A big son of a bitch has put his car
in the "handicapped" spot again.

14
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:01,832
But we don't care.

15
00:02:03,264 --> 00:02:04,972
Go ahead, buddies.

16
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:06,173
Arnaud.

17
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:08,031
Change your shoes.
- OK.

18
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:09,764
Boris!

19
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:12,380
What did we say about costumes?
We put them over there, OK?

20
00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:14,345
I'm not Boris, je suis Cléopâtre.

21
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,329
Yes, go change, Cleopatra!

22
00:02:16,996 --> 00:02:19,203
Your backpack is coming, Marc has it.

23
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:20,995
Are we OK, is everything there?

24
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:25,036
Mayane, what's this?
We said one suitcase per person.

25
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,286
I only have one.

26
00:02:27,619 --> 00:02:28,661
What's this?

27
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:31,743
- It's bags.
- It's bags... It's bags.

28
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:33,409
You're right, it's bags.

29
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,075
I just have to be more specific.
And I'm the one carrying them, huh?

30
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:39,551
There.

31
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:42,867
Hello, it's Céline again,
from the Lilacs Home.

32
00:02:43,015 --> 00:02:46,765
There's still a big bag of shit...

33
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:49,782
Can't you see that I play football?

34
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,508
- Eh, eh!
- Get lost!

35
00:02:51,532 --> 00:02:53,032
You can see that...

36
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,323
Come. Come over there.

37
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:56,334
Céline, if we could avoid this, please...

38
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,710
- You have to be on the ball!
- It's OK, it's OK.

39
00:02:58,947 --> 00:03:01,864
They have to learn from mistakes.

40
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:04,807
The mistake is that he's going to
get hit by a car.

41
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:05,812
Thank you, Marc.

42
00:03:05,871 --> 00:03:08,202
It was nothing. I am here,
I will always be here.

43
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:10,955
Can we avoid playing
football on the road?

44
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,153
Stop whining!

45
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,188
We are robbing her,
it's normal that she's whining!

46
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:19,385
This is crazy!

47
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,707
She has the right to cry.
This is crazy.

48
00:03:21,732 --> 00:03:23,355
We are robbing you, you have the right.

49
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,258
- Merci...
- It's normal.

50
00:03:26,235 --> 00:03:27,901
- Are you together?
- Yes.

51
00:03:28,203 --> 00:03:29,327
Yes?

52
00:03:29,588 --> 00:03:30,607
Married?

53
00:03:30,706 --> 00:03:33,943
No, precisely, I wanted to choose
an engagement ring today.

54
00:03:33,968 --> 00:03:35,042
Huh?

55
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:36,807
Oh, she didn't know!

56
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,141
The timing sucks, but it's cool.

57
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,620
- Marc.
- I'm here, I'm always here.

58
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:48,790
Can you ask the driver to wait
5 minutes, please?

59
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:50,997
Damn, Thibaut.

60
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:52,184
No, Mayane!

61
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:53,640
Let's get out of here!

62
00:03:53,665 --> 00:03:55,503
- Come on, let's get out!
- Yes, but I...

63
00:03:58,215 --> 00:03:59,214
Congratulations.

64
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:02,646
- What are you doing? Come on!
- I'm coming!

65
00:04:02,753 --> 00:04:03,836
Let's go!

66
00:04:09,913 --> 00:04:11,038
Come on! Go, go, go!

67
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,244
To the right!

68
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:16,124
Take the bag.
Hurry up! Hurry up!

69
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,155
Yes, uh...

70
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,223
Let's go!

71
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,015
Get the clothes out!
Quick, come on!

72
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:21,622
It's good, I got them.

73
00:04:21,684 --> 00:04:23,285
The clothes, the clothes!
Hurry up, asshole!

74
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:24,338
Yes.

75
00:04:26,845 --> 00:04:27,969
Come on, come on!

76
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:31,683
There... Good, that's fine.

77
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:35,400
Come on, let's go!

78
00:04:36,654 --> 00:04:38,433
- There.
- How are you dressed?

79
00:04:38,782 --> 00:04:40,178
- Huh?
- How are you dressed??

80
00:04:40,203 --> 00:04:42,952
Like a tourist, a German tourist,
it goes unnoticed.

81
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:45,353
You're like a clown,
they'll see that it was you!

82
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,201
You, it's obvious that you
just committed a robbery.

83
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:50,877
Marc?

84
00:04:50,902 --> 00:04:53,026
Alice? Ouch! Yeah?

85
00:04:53,488 --> 00:04:54,984
Any news on the new one?

86
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:57,911
Sylvain? I got his parents, he's coming.

87
00:04:57,976 --> 00:04:59,559
Ok, great. Thanks.

88
00:05:01,806 --> 00:05:02,983
Thank you, sir.

89
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:06,802
On behalf of the Republic,
as Nicolas Sarkozy said,

90
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:11,318
"The test is the absence,
and not the wound of vanity."

91
00:05:11,343 --> 00:05:14,732
- Come, sir...
- No, we have to thank him!

92
00:05:14,884 --> 00:05:17,984
It's not because he does a job
out of spite,

93
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:21,234
due to an academic failure, that we should not thank him.

94
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:23,691
No, Alexandre, you shouldn't say that.

95
00:05:23,827 --> 00:05:28,202
The gentleman surely did not do
great studies, but it's a job like any other.

96
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,591
You go, it's better this way,
we thank you, sir...

97
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:32,032
- Thank you, sir.
- Goodbye, sir.

98
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,851
Let's go!

99
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,218
- Did you say goodbye?
- Thanks, goodbye, sir!

100
00:05:36,243 --> 00:05:38,492
And there, it's complete.

101
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,672
You won't be able to carry the suitcases!

102
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:44,859
- Why, Ludo?
- Because you're fat!

103
00:05:45,015 --> 00:05:48,681
Hey, Ludovic!
What did we say about insults?

104
00:05:48,706 --> 00:05:51,247
- It's not nice!
- Then why do you say that?

105
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:52,610
Because he's fat!

106
00:05:52,635 --> 00:05:55,628
He knows, there is no point in telling him!

107
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:57,891
Boris, what did I say?

108
00:05:58,128 --> 00:05:59,813
I'm not Boris, I'm Supergirl.

109
00:05:59,838 --> 00:06:01,417
Stop drinking, Gnafron!

110
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:04,001
- Are you crazy or what?
- Gnafron?

111
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:08,001
Eh! Are we on vacation
or are we not on vacation?

112
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:10,775
Soso.

113
00:06:10,977 --> 00:06:11,976
Gad.

114
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:13,310
Alexandre.

115
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:14,797
- Marie.
- Absent.

116
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:16,109
Boris.

117
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:17,661
Arnaud.
- Present!

118
00:06:17,686 --> 00:06:18,810
Baptiste.

119
00:06:18,966 --> 00:06:20,383
Princess Mayane.

120
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:21,780
...and basket!
Thibaut.

121
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:24,258
- We're going on vacation!
- Ludovic.

122
00:06:24,398 --> 00:06:25,599
- Everybody's here.
- Cool.

123
00:06:25,657 --> 00:06:28,115
- Except, uh... Sylvain.
- We'll wait for him.

124
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,693
You distribute water bottles.

125
00:06:30,862 --> 00:06:32,588
- Let's go.
- Ludo.

126
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:34,987
Catch. And you...

127
00:06:35,164 --> 00:06:37,039
- There!
- And there!

128
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:39,247
Oh, damn it, Marie!

129
00:06:39,455 --> 00:06:41,454
Nothing serious, she's used to it.

130
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:43,578
- I'm not  <i>firsty</i>!
- No, she's not  <i>firsty</i>, I think...

131
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:50,969
Come on, come on! Over there!

132
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:53,458
The car is no longer there.

133
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:56,911
Obviously, you parked
in a "disabled" spot.

134
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:59,285
Obviously, obviously...
You know everything!

135
00:06:59,493 --> 00:07:02,742
- What'll we do now?
- Hush, we walk quietly.

136
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:04,723
<i>Guten tag.</i>

137
00:07:04,784 --> 00:07:06,409
<i>Hacht Fartun Ouch.</i>

138
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,535
<i>Ich Liebe Dich.</i>

139
00:07:09,091 --> 00:07:10,966
- Is that normal?
- I'm trying...

140
00:07:10,991 --> 00:07:12,908
Shut up, it's better.

141
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:15,657
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
Shit!

142
00:07:15,866 --> 00:07:17,769
When do you park in a "disabled" spot?

143
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,093
There was one spot, I needed it...

144
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:22,276
- Shut up
- It was obvious.

145
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:24,865
- Move!
- We move, we move.

146
00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:27,364
- They are over there.
- There, there.

147
00:07:30,108 --> 00:07:31,214
What the hell is this?

148
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:33,772
It's nothing.
I think your latecomer has arrived.

149
00:07:33,797 --> 00:07:35,839
- What's he doing?
- Oh, yes. Sylvain?

150
00:07:36,946 --> 00:07:38,904
I'll find a solution... What?

151
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:41,089
Sylvain, is that you?

152
00:07:43,532 --> 00:07:44,574
I am Alice.

153
00:07:49,944 --> 00:07:52,379
I'm happy to see you, we were
waiting for you. Coming?

154
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:53,441
Come.

155
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:56,555
Yes, Sylvain. You have to go.

156
00:07:56,761 --> 00:07:58,511
- We were waiting for you.
- Oh, yes?

157
00:07:58,692 --> 00:08:00,151
Come on, we have to go.

158
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:01,543
Go ahead, get in.

159
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,235
Let me introduce you to Sylvain, my friends!

160
00:08:08,307 --> 00:08:10,010
Excuse me, we're going to leave.

161
00:08:10,235 --> 00:08:11,828
Yes, we have to leave.

162
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:14,427
Who are you to him?
His educator?

163
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,540
Yes, exactly.

164
00:08:15,565 --> 00:08:17,503
I have to be with him.

165
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:20,706
There's no question about it,
last time it was shit.

166
00:08:20,731 --> 00:08:22,898
But we didn't plan that.

167
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:25,679
Sylvain?

168
00:08:25,942 --> 00:08:27,025
Welcome.

169
00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:30,051
Do you want to sit at the back of the bus?
- OK, uh...

170
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,083
We'll sort this out at the lodge?
- Let's do this, come on.

171
00:08:36,145 --> 00:08:39,603
Unfortunately, you are in a sector of activity

172
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:43,186
very little represented in
the popular imagination.

173
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:48,743
And in the end, the only figurehead
of your profession remains Emile Louis.

174
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,483
- Can we go already?
- Yeah, we're going.

175
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:53,185
- What do we say to the driver?
- Son of a bitch!

176
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,501
No, Ludo, not that. We say...?

177
00:08:55,684 --> 00:09:01,225
- Long live the holidays!
- Long live the holidays!

178
00:09:06,335 --> 00:09:08,501
So, did you convince her?
What did you tell her?

179
00:09:08,557 --> 00:09:10,515
- Eh?
- What did you tell her?

180
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:13,832
Well, I told her that you were...

181
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:18,037
...you were sensitive, and there were
moments when you shit yourself.

182
00:09:18,468 --> 00:09:21,238
- How come? I don't shit myself.
- Oh, yeah?

183
00:09:21,263 --> 00:09:22,197
Well, no.

184
00:09:22,222 --> 00:09:25,213
Should I remind you?
Palavas? Luna Park?

185
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:26,928
I was four years old, are you serious?

186
00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:30,012
Well, you were four,
you were shitting yourself.

187
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:41,688
So what do we do?

188
00:09:41,969 --> 00:09:43,385
Do what they do.

189
00:09:43,468 --> 00:09:45,468
Look at them, look what they're like.

190
00:09:45,821 --> 00:09:50,051
- I don't do the German anymore?
- No. You shut up and do like them.

191
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:52,810
Damn, he has a kippah.

192
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:55,716
He believes in God, doesn't hold grudges.

193
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:16,421
Come on, find your inner clown.
Find your inner clown.

194
00:10:24,072 --> 00:10:27,378
It's too much, it's too much.
I'm trying to find the right way.

195
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:34,396
- Damn, but look at them.
- I'm trying. Excuse me, but...

196
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:38,601
She's coming, she's coming!

197
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:40,192
Shut your mouth.

198
00:10:40,334 --> 00:10:42,215
I'm delighted to be on vacation.

199
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:44,075
Ah, it's cool.

200
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:49,699
- Are you okay, Sylvain?
- Yeah.

201
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,773
Yeah? I'm pleased to meet you.

202
00:10:53,056 --> 00:10:55,597
You're going to make friends,
it's going to be great.

203
00:10:55,622 --> 00:10:57,789
- Should I put your bag up there?
- No.

204
00:10:58,206 --> 00:11:01,039
No, in fact, I have to keep the bag.

205
00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:04,105
- All the medications are inside.
- All right.

206
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,955
There.

207
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:10,585
Will you introduce your educator?
What's his name?

208
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:11,676
- I'm...
- No!

209
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:15,204
In fact, no, no, it's better...
He's having trouble, we can see...

210
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:18,333
Yes, but we'll take our time,
like that, we'll meet.

211
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:21,828
I hear the sound of your voice,
you haven't lost your tongue.

212
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:24,643
What's your educator's name?

213
00:11:27,484 --> 00:11:28,983
We have time, OK?

214
00:11:29,508 --> 00:11:31,216
Orpi. Orpi.

215
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:32,915
Orpi.
- Orpi?

216
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,004
- Orpi, yeah.
- Okay. It's funny.

217
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,884
Orpi. Orpi.

218
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,592
- Yeah, Orpi.
- We understood.

219
00:11:38,617 --> 00:11:40,283
We understood.

220
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,599
I'm Alice. I am delighted.

221
00:11:42,624 --> 00:11:44,227
- Me, I'm Sylvain.
- Yes, Sylvain.

222
00:11:44,261 --> 00:11:46,511
- Sylvain, and he is Orpi.
- Yes, that's it, we understood.

223
00:11:46,536 --> 00:11:48,078
- Sylvain et Orpi.
- It's good.

224
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:51,795
Orpi, present. Sylvain, present here.

225
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,012
- There.
- Ok, great.

226
00:11:53,174 --> 00:11:55,632
- If you're a little upset...
- Yes, it's hot.

227
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,031
...you tell me and we'll stop.
All right?

228
00:11:58,311 --> 00:11:59,310
OK.

229
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:02,052
Don't poop in your underwear.
OK?

230
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,354
- No.
- No, no.

231
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:04,867
See you later.

232
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:08,838
And according to Séguéla,

233
00:12:09,053 --> 00:12:11,203
Sarkozy, at the first dinner,

234
00:12:11,228 --> 00:12:13,420
would have whispered in Carla's ear,

235
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:16,277
"Can I kiss you on the mouth
in front of everybody?"

236
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,074
"Are you up for it or not?",

237
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,138
at which she apparently answered
"not up to it".

238
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:23,452
And since then, they have been in love
for life. It's beautiful, huh?

239
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,673
Alice, can I put a little zizik?

240
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:41,257
Yes, go ahead.

241
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:44,772
Intro!

242
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:46,440
Contrary to what everybody thinks,

243
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,167
that's why he wears heels.

244
00:12:49,273 --> 00:12:50,564
It's funny, huh?

245
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:56,396
What is this?

246
00:12:58,156 --> 00:12:59,697
This music sucks.

247
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:07,268
I can't stand this music, Marc!

248
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:09,186
It absolutely sucks!
- It sucks!

249
00:13:09,346 --> 00:13:10,763
Go fuck yourself!

250
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,661
Hey, what the hell is this music, Marc?

251
00:13:14,686 --> 00:13:16,466
This? This is shit?

252
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:17,577
Yes, Dalida is better.

253
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:20,311
It's Paul Diamond, guys.
Paul, Diamond!

254
00:13:20,336 --> 00:13:22,367
- I like it.
- You're jealous! You don't know...

255
00:13:22,392 --> 00:13:25,293
Leave it. Go sit down,
I'll take care of it.

256
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:26,402
OK.

257
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:27,804
Come on.

258
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,017
There.

259
00:13:33,832 --> 00:13:35,532
She is great!

260
00:13:35,677 --> 00:13:37,385
That's not shit!

261
00:14:28,673 --> 00:14:30,548
Pan pan, the pistols.

262
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,886
I'm loading.
Oh, I dropped my magazine.

263
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:36,680
- What are you doing, Paulo?
- I put myself in character.

264
00:15:12,898 --> 00:15:15,149
Click-click,
Pan-Pan-Pan

265
00:15:15,316 --> 00:15:18,024
And it's click, click-click,
Pan-Pan-Pan

266
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:19,937
What do we do?

267
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,552
I don't know. I'm thinking.

268
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,499
Ah, I know.

269
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:27,917
We can take them hostage.

270
00:15:28,332 --> 00:15:29,915
Stop thinking.

271
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:33,438
Ah, I'm going to...
I'm going to call Rico.

272
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:38,826
Ah, damn! No network, obviously.

273
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,532
Hey!

274
00:15:45,189 --> 00:15:46,648
Hey, excuse me.

275
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,216
Do you know where there is network?

276
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:52,535
You have a little in the field,
but it's hot.

277
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:53,868
OK, thanks.

278
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,118
Boris, can I help you with your suitcase?

279
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,010
Why doesn't the bus go up?

280
00:15:58,035 --> 00:15:59,314
As I tell you each year,

281
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:02,089
Moisard the owner is afraid
that we will damage his path.

282
00:16:02,114 --> 00:16:03,697
Because? Because?...

283
00:16:04,086 --> 00:16:07,051
Because Moisard is an asshole!

284
00:16:07,492 --> 00:16:09,450
Asshole! Asshole!

285
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:14,324
Moisard, asshole! Moisard, asshole!
Moisard, asshole!

286
00:16:14,532 --> 00:16:16,532
Moisard, asshole!

287
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:18,740
...asshole! Moisard, asshole!

288
00:16:19,008 --> 00:16:21,339
- Bonjour, M. Moisard.
- Hello, Mr. Moisard.

289
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,838
- Moisard, asshole!
- Hello, Mr. Moisard!

290
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:29,655
- Bonjour, M. Moisard.
- Hi, you're nice kid.

291
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:30,988
Hello.

292
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:33,763
Moisard, asshole!
Moisard, asshole!

293
00:16:34,337 --> 00:16:36,212
- Hello, how are you?
- Good morning.

294
00:16:36,237 --> 00:16:38,737
- Excuse them.
- No, there is no harm.

295
00:16:39,282 --> 00:16:41,533
- Here you are, the keys.
- That's great, thanks a lot.

296
00:16:41,558 --> 00:16:44,432
And I wanted to tell you,
next year I will increase the rate.

297
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:47,153
- Is this a joke?
- No.

298
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:51,116
But our entire budget for the year
goes into this rental.

299
00:16:51,192 --> 00:16:54,318
- It's not my fault.
- They have been coming here for 10 years.

300
00:16:54,343 --> 00:16:56,192
Well, yes, that's why I warn you in advance.

301
00:16:56,217 --> 00:16:59,807
Can't you make a good deed?
We have no subsidy.

302
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:01,491
This way you'll have the chance
to find something else.

303
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:03,963
We don't want something else.
They are attached to this place.

304
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:06,384
It's not my fault.
So, have a nice stay.

305
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:08,579
It's not your fault... Jerk.

306
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:10,387
- Excuse me?
- What?

307
00:17:10,888 --> 00:17:12,697
I didn't say that. It was...

308
00:17:12,915 --> 00:17:15,058
Ludovic, we said
"no more bad words"!

309
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,073
I didn't say "jerk", but "asshole"!

310
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,415
All right...

311
00:17:18,492 --> 00:17:19,836
Enjoy it.

312
00:17:19,976 --> 00:17:20,976
OK.

313
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,076
Alice, no, no, you shouldn't do that,
I should.

314
00:17:26,322 --> 00:17:27,888
I'm here, I'm always here.

315
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,121
Yeah, thank you.

316
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:36,359
Orpi, can you come help us?
We're settling in.

317
00:17:36,384 --> 00:17:38,878
No, it's not possible,
because I'm making a call.

318
00:17:38,903 --> 00:17:40,963
It's not the time now for that.

319
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,184
And Sylvain's parents still haven't
paid for the stay.

320
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:46,759
Ah, well, it's funny that you should say that,

321
00:17:46,783 --> 00:17:49,815
because, exactly, I have to call
Sylvain's father

322
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,465
so that he can pay you the money
and you're not in trouble.

323
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,423
- Where is the network, you were saying?
- Towards the two trees.

324
00:17:57,933 --> 00:18:00,349
- Be quick about it!
- Of course, what do you think?

325
00:18:04,553 --> 00:18:06,010
Are you okay, Sylvain?

326
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,295
Sylvain?

327
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,629
- I'm hungry!
- Are you OK, Sylvain?

328
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:14,639
- Yes.
- OK. Alright?

329
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:16,361
Yes.

330
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,378
Feel at home here, OK?

331
00:18:19,563 --> 00:18:21,855
I'll manage the beds, Céline.

332
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,554
- You...
- Yes.

333
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,006
Let's go.

334
00:18:26,392 --> 00:18:27,933
Gad, you come up with us.

335
00:18:30,771 --> 00:18:32,904
Gad, Gad! Not there.

336
00:18:37,387 --> 00:18:41,137
Alice. I and Sylvain,
we want to sleep in the same bed.

337
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:42,258
Huh?

338
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:44,603
It's not possible, my darling.

339
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:46,879
It's possible. We are in love.

340
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:48,884
Oh, yeah, you're already in love?

341
00:18:49,112 --> 00:18:51,300
Yes, anyway, it's...

342
00:18:51,815 --> 00:18:54,286
We are in talks.
It's not acted upon.

343
00:18:54,311 --> 00:18:56,685
In any case it's not possible
to sleep in a friend's bed.

344
00:18:57,232 --> 00:18:58,816
- Oh...
- Each to their own bed.

345
00:18:58,986 --> 00:19:01,486
Oh, it's not possible...
Oh, what a shame.

346
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:03,305
It's not...

347
00:19:03,506 --> 00:19:05,631
It's bad luck.
It's not my fault.

348
00:19:06,523 --> 00:19:07,522
I would have loved it.

349
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,671
You each have your own bed.

350
00:19:09,946 --> 00:19:11,071
Let's go.

351
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:13,130
What "let's go"?

352
00:19:13,337 --> 00:19:15,421
Don't worry, everything is fine.
Come.

353
00:19:18,768 --> 00:19:20,935
- Everything OK?
- Yeah. Did you see Baptiste?

354
00:19:21,484 --> 00:19:24,275
No, I imagine that he's
exploring the surroundings.

355
00:19:27,651 --> 00:19:29,567
This is my tattoo.

356
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:31,921
Ah yes, I can see it.

357
00:19:32,044 --> 00:19:34,518
I'm a fan of Dalida.

358
00:19:34,689 --> 00:19:36,314
- No, really?
- Yes.

359
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,142
I should've guessed.

360
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:40,042
She was singing "With time",

361
00:19:40,067 --> 00:19:42,959
"Dying on stage" and "I'm sick".

362
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,495
Okay, okay.

363
00:19:45,891 --> 00:19:48,378
Maybe you could... Yeah.
Thanks.

364
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:49,957
Which bed do you want?

365
00:19:50,613 --> 00:19:51,863
Well, I...

366
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,358
This one, it is good.

367
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:55,137
OK.

368
00:19:58,556 --> 00:20:00,514
I'll take the other, no big deal.

369
00:20:00,612 --> 00:20:02,612
- OK.
- That's it.

370
00:20:06,108 --> 00:20:07,936
And which one do you want?

371
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:11,333
Oh...

372
00:20:12,263 --> 00:20:13,513
This is gonna take a while...

373
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:16,226
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes.

374
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:18,183
Oh, damn.

375
00:20:19,978 --> 00:20:23,020
- Do you want to come and play football?
- Wait, I'm making a call.

376
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:26,410
Come on, lift.

377
00:20:27,932 --> 00:20:29,618
Wait! Cut! Cut!

378
00:20:29,984 --> 00:20:30,983
Cut.

379
00:20:31,714 --> 00:20:33,109
Hello?
<i>- Yes.</i>

380
00:20:33,134 --> 00:20:34,763
Yes. It's, uh... it's The Strawberry.

381
00:20:34,947 --> 00:20:36,072
Come!

382
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:38,169
Do you wanna come?
- Wait a moment.

383
00:20:38,796 --> 00:20:40,899
Do you understand when I talk to you
or don't you?

384
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:42,735
- Come, we're going to play.
- No, I'm OK, it's fine.

385
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,153
Listen, I have a problem with the...

386
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:46,991
I have a problem with the car.

387
00:20:47,022 --> 00:20:48,764
- What?
- We have to rec... This pisses me off!

388
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,816
You have to go get it in...

389
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:52,176
to the pound, because

390
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:53,908
<i>if they make the connection,
they'll go back up...</i>

391
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:55,324
Come and play!

392
00:20:55,349 --> 00:20:57,037
...they will come up to me, understand?

393
00:20:57,062 --> 00:20:58,280
Damn, guys.

394
00:20:58,312 --> 00:20:59,870
- You think this is funny?
- Come on, come on!

395
00:21:00,308 --> 00:21:01,171
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

396
00:21:01,196 --> 00:21:02,922
- I'm getting the car back.
- Come!

397
00:21:02,947 --> 00:21:04,530
Well, you sort it out!

398
00:21:05,838 --> 00:21:06,681
Damn it!

399
00:21:06,706 --> 00:21:09,870
We're going to play a game.
You go in the goal. Be the goalkeeper.

400
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,388
- You wanna play?
- Come, we're going to play a game.

401
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:16,531
There you go!

402
00:21:16,988 --> 00:21:19,529
Go play the game. Yeah, go!
Come on, run!

403
00:21:19,585 --> 00:21:20,844
Come on, go!

404
00:21:22,337 --> 00:21:24,998
That's good.
- Where is my ball?

405
00:21:26,778 --> 00:21:28,861
But where did it go? Oh!

406
00:21:30,194 --> 00:21:31,569
Where is my ball?

407
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:34,198
You keep this one.
I'll take that one.

408
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:37,690
Like this, we are... We each have
our own. That's good too.

409
00:21:39,313 --> 00:21:40,688
And which one do you take?

410
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:47,770
I'm your buddy, and you're the best.

411
00:21:48,722 --> 00:21:49,805
Cool.

412
00:21:51,403 --> 00:21:52,902
Very, very close.

413
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:54,979
That's for sure. Day and night.

414
00:21:55,663 --> 00:21:57,038
Day and night...

415
00:21:58,933 --> 00:21:59,894
Cool...

416
00:22:08,455 --> 00:22:10,228
- Aren't you with Baptiste?
- What?

417
00:22:10,253 --> 00:22:11,726
Aren't you with Baptiste?

418
00:22:11,848 --> 00:22:14,597
- Which one is he?
- The tall one with a ball.

419
00:22:14,685 --> 00:22:17,267
Ah, no. He must have fun with the others.

420
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:21,100
What the hell is this?
That's enough, turn off the music!

421
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:24,200
No, no, get off the table.
Get off the table, girls.

422
00:22:24,224 --> 00:22:26,105
Everyone in the shower.

423
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,297
Ludo, stop eating candy.
Boris, come down.

424
00:22:29,657 --> 00:22:31,640
Orpi, can you help me
manage the girls, please?

425
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:35,240
- It's too high.
- He'll take you off the table.

426
00:22:35,265 --> 00:22:37,821
- What's wrong with you?
- It's okay.

427
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:39,697
No, it's not, they'll get hurt.

428
00:22:39,806 --> 00:22:42,388
No, but I mean, there are worse things.

429
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:44,697
For example, we lost Baptiste.

430
00:22:44,722 --> 00:22:46,472
- What?
- We lost Baptiste.

431
00:22:46,726 --> 00:22:48,767
- Meaning...?
- I can't find him.

432
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:50,100
Did you look for him?

433
00:22:50,221 --> 00:22:52,244
It's okay, don't worry.

434
00:22:52,597 --> 00:22:55,430
At the speed it's moving,
he can't be far.

435
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,876
Yeah, great... Marc!

436
00:22:57,901 --> 00:22:58,900
Alice!

437
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,594
- Marc, can you come?
- Yeah.

438
00:23:02,428 --> 00:23:03,360
I am here.

439
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:04,860
I'll always be here.

440
00:23:05,068 --> 00:23:08,318
- It seems we have a problem, we lost Baptiste.
- We lost Baptiste?

441
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:10,651
- We lost Baptiste. Don't panic.
- OK.

442
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:13,034
What we'll do is, you go with Orpi
to look for him,

443
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,311
we don't tell anyone,
we don't create panic. OK?

444
00:23:17,336 --> 00:23:19,299
- He can go alone.
- No, no.

445
00:23:19,508 --> 00:23:22,007
- Come on, to the shower!
- To the shower!

446
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:23,483
Follow me.

447
00:23:23,795 --> 00:23:25,128
Damn.

448
00:23:28,965 --> 00:23:31,590
Hey, you forgot me!

449
00:23:32,221 --> 00:23:34,159
- Baptiste!
- Baptiste!

450
00:23:36,496 --> 00:23:38,413
- Baptiste!
- Baptiste!

451
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,380
Eh, oh, buddy!

452
00:23:40,588 --> 00:23:42,671
- Hey, hey, come there. He's...
- What?

453
00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:44,833
He's not there, he's in the forest.

454
00:23:45,873 --> 00:23:47,243
What would he do there?

455
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:50,773
Well... I just know it.
It's the instincts of an educator.

456
00:23:51,003 --> 00:23:52,128
Baptiste!

457
00:23:55,189 --> 00:23:56,272
Baptiste!

458
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,794
- Damn.
- Oh, damn...

459
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,373
Baptiste, my friend!

460
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:04,740
Baptiste!

461
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:08,182
Okay, let's go. I'm sick of this.

462
00:24:08,753 --> 00:24:10,524
That's enough. This is worrying.
I'll call the police.

463
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,003
No, no, no! No police.

464
00:24:12,636 --> 00:24:14,442
Orpi, my phone!
This is the procedure.

465
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:15,466
Stop!

466
00:24:15,905 --> 00:24:16,904
No!

467
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,305
Damn!

468
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:20,941
No! No. No.

469
00:24:21,311 --> 00:24:22,527
Listen, no.

470
00:24:22,552 --> 00:24:23,551
Excuse me.

471
00:24:23,915 --> 00:24:27,806
It is important for them to discover nature,
to immerse themselves in it.

472
00:24:27,911 --> 00:24:30,094
It's part of the process.

473
00:24:30,374 --> 00:24:31,373
Huh?

474
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:32,955
Don't worry.

475
00:24:33,209 --> 00:24:36,578
In 15 minutes we'll call the police,
if we don't find him.

476
00:24:36,871 --> 00:24:38,662
- In 15 minutes.
- There you go.

477
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,162
OK? Come on, go on that side.

478
00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:42,177
- Baptiste!
- My phone.

479
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,595
Orpi, my phone!

480
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,161
It's good, I have it.

481
00:24:46,379 --> 00:24:47,271
He's annoying.

482
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:48,858
Come, little one!
Come!

483
00:24:48,883 --> 00:24:49,883
Baptiste!

484
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,019
Baptiste!

485
00:24:55,471 --> 00:24:57,816
Come on, my Baptiste! Ronaldo!

486
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,786
It's okay now, Baptiste.
Oh, damn!

487
00:25:03,492 --> 00:25:04,783
Orpi!

488
00:25:05,283 --> 00:25:08,366
It's good! I found him, he's with me!

489
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:13,807
- There he is.
- Well, here you are.

490
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:16,621
We've been through the whole forest...
He was here.

491
00:25:16,743 --> 00:25:19,257
- Shall we go, my friend?
- Let's get up. Stand up.

492
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:22,344
Super.

493
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:24,035
Holy cow, what's wrong with him?

494
00:25:24,852 --> 00:25:26,643
I lost my ball.

495
00:25:27,181 --> 00:25:30,196
- He lost his ball.
- Yes, OK, I got it...

496
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,837
Don't worry, we'll find you
another one.

497
00:25:31,862 --> 00:25:32,651
Let's go.

498
00:25:32,676 --> 00:25:35,541
I want mine. Don't follow me.

499
00:25:35,643 --> 00:25:37,692
I want to look for it by myself.

500
00:25:37,967 --> 00:25:39,092
He's gone again.

501
00:25:39,161 --> 00:25:41,361
If you have another intuition, I'll take it.

502
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:43,576
You have to bring it back, period.
This is stupid.

503
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:44,726
My phone, Orpi.

504
00:25:54,227 --> 00:25:55,554
Oh, damn!

505
00:25:55,579 --> 00:25:57,579
What are you doing there,
behind me?

506
00:25:57,775 --> 00:25:59,257
What are you doing there?

507
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:00,858
You're not disabled.

508
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:05,726
Yes, I am disabled. I've always
been disabled, since I was little.

509
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:07,744
It doesn't look like it.

510
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:09,060
I am too, I believe I...

511
00:26:09,089 --> 00:26:11,422
Ah, well, it shows right away.

512
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:18,346
You're right, I am not disabled.
There. I'm...

513
00:26:19,006 --> 00:26:21,602
I'm from the police.
I'm investigating a guy in this region...

514
00:26:21,627 --> 00:26:23,168
You're not a police officer.

515
00:26:24,782 --> 00:26:26,948
No, I'm not a police officer either.

516
00:26:27,903 --> 00:26:30,778
I... I did some little stupid things.

517
00:26:30,853 --> 00:26:33,811
So I have to hide a little while.

518
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:37,130
There, at least, you tell me the truth.

519
00:26:38,238 --> 00:26:40,279
- What's your name?
- Arnaud.

520
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,306
Delighted. Paulo.

521
00:26:42,415 --> 00:26:44,789
Don't tell anyone anything,
otherwise I'll go to jail.

522
00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:47,601
I won't say anything to anyone.

523
00:26:48,111 --> 00:26:49,443
Apart from Ludovic.

524
00:26:49,896 --> 00:26:50,700
Who is Ludovic?

525
00:26:50,725 --> 00:26:52,142
It's me, little dick!

526
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:55,640
Do you know what they do in prison
in the showers?

527
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,324
Uh, no. Why is he saying that?

528
00:26:58,368 --> 00:26:59,909
But I don't know!

529
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,352
All right.

530
00:27:02,407 --> 00:27:03,448
OK.

531
00:27:03,586 --> 00:27:05,531
You don't tell anyone anything.
- I won't say anything.

532
00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:08,139
- We say nothing.
- Nothing to anyone.

533
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,855
- OK
- Trust me.

534
00:27:10,216 --> 00:27:11,822
Is it difficult to wash your back?

535
00:27:12,586 --> 00:27:14,263
- Excuse me?
- Wash your back?

536
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:15,972
Wash your back? Uh, I...

537
00:27:16,065 --> 00:27:17,524
Wash my back.

538
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:18,842
I don't have...

539
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:20,326
Wash my back!

540
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:23,010
Oh yeah, that's what I had...
Okay.

541
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:24,486
- No. I won't do it.
- You will too.

542
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:25,595
- No.
- Alice!

543
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,219
No, no! OK...

544
00:27:28,386 --> 00:27:30,386
OK, fine. I will...

545
00:27:31,647 --> 00:27:34,605
I'll wash your back, there.
I'll wash your back. Come in, then.

546
00:27:35,105 --> 00:27:36,897
- All of us?
- All right. Everybody.

547
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:38,888
OK.

548
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,859
- Let's go.
- Wow, wow.

549
00:27:44,016 --> 00:27:45,308
Wait, that touches me.

550
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:52,697
Damn, you found him, great.

551
00:27:53,591 --> 00:27:55,965
Where was he?
- In the forest.

552
00:27:56,206 --> 00:27:58,206
Great, Orpi, thank you very much.

553
00:27:58,756 --> 00:28:01,631
Thank you, Orpi, thank you Orpi...
I'm the one who found him.

554
00:28:01,878 --> 00:28:04,462
- Huh, Baptiste, I'm the one who found you?
- No, it's Orpi.

555
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:08,758
- Are you taking him to the shower?
- Yes.

556
00:28:08,783 --> 00:28:09,977
Shall we go?

557
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:11,782
I want Orpi.

558
00:28:11,962 --> 00:28:13,421
Oh, no. No, no.

559
00:28:13,446 --> 00:28:16,249
Go with him,
he has his little pink gloves.

560
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,944
I want it to be with Orpi. Sorry, Marc.

561
00:28:19,378 --> 00:28:20,586
Is that okay with you?

562
00:28:20,795 --> 00:28:22,294
I have no choice.

563
00:28:26,127 --> 00:28:28,793
The shower is here.
Come on, take your shower.

564
00:28:28,818 --> 00:28:30,959
You have to undress me,
I can't do it alone.

565
00:28:32,746 --> 00:28:34,205
Damn, what a pain.

566
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:37,500
Ok, raise your arms.

567
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,832
Not the belly. Don't touch the belly.
I don't want that!

568
00:28:44,107 --> 00:28:45,440
Damn, that's stupid!

569
00:28:45,615 --> 00:28:46,657
Shht!

570
00:28:47,503 --> 00:28:49,545
Damn, you broke my phone!

571
00:28:49,707 --> 00:28:52,664
- I didn't break it!
- Shh, not so loud. Be quiet.

572
00:28:52,873 --> 00:28:54,581
- I didn't break it.
- OK.

573
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:56,416
But we don't speak loudly.

574
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:59,468
I didn't want to break it, excuse me.

575
00:29:01,174 --> 00:29:02,173
OK...

576
00:29:02,746 --> 00:29:04,038
It's cool.

577
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,412
OK, come on.

578
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:10,950
I'll undress you. I'll try
not to touch your belly, OK?

579
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:14,497
I undress a kid...
Higher. Higher.

580
00:29:14,745 --> 00:29:15,729
There.

581
00:29:16,312 --> 00:29:18,494
- Not the nose, don't touch, no nose!
- Not the nose.

582
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:20,577
- Not the arms!
- Fine.

583
00:29:20,871 --> 00:29:23,579
- Not the arms, not the nose...
- Not the belly.

584
00:29:25,118 --> 00:29:27,868
From behind? I think it's...

585
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:29,339
Not from the back.

586
00:29:29,844 --> 00:29:32,885
- We're going to eat!
- We're going to eat, yes.

587
00:29:35,019 --> 00:29:37,227
You all take your places.

588
00:29:38,274 --> 00:29:40,190
Gad here, Baptiste there.

589
00:29:41,372 --> 00:29:42,948
Come on, Boris, sit down.

590
00:29:43,122 --> 00:29:44,413
Baptiste, you're there.

591
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,166
Everyone in their place,
we're good?

592
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:52,018
Sylvain!

593
00:29:52,212 --> 00:29:53,747
Can you come?
I have to talk to you.

594
00:29:53,772 --> 00:29:55,571
- Where are we going?
- To activity?

595
00:29:55,653 --> 00:29:57,652
We go to activity!

596
00:29:57,935 --> 00:29:59,184
We're going to the whores!

597
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,649
No, no one will go to the whores!

598
00:30:02,674 --> 00:30:04,952
We're not going to the whores?

599
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:06,357
No, we're not going to the whores,
I'm sorry.

600
00:30:06,382 --> 00:30:09,694
- Why?
- Well, that's how things are.

601
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,416
But we're going to do activities,
don't worry.

602
00:30:14,865 --> 00:30:16,938
A little bit of silence
and I'll tell you something

603
00:30:16,963 --> 00:30:18,282
because it's the beginning of summer.

604
00:30:18,307 --> 00:30:20,775
We're going to have a great summer together.
I'm really happy.

605
00:30:20,827 --> 00:30:22,234
Well, we're not.

606
00:30:23,295 --> 00:30:24,295
You're not?

607
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:26,733
That's it, you liar.

608
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:30,649
Above all, the important thing is
that today we welcome...

609
00:30:30,717 --> 00:30:33,195
- A shit!
- No, we welcome Sylvain.

610
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,511
Sylvain!

611
00:30:34,815 --> 00:30:36,899
There. So say hello to Sylvain.

612
00:30:37,106 --> 00:30:38,315
Hello, Sylvain!

613
00:30:38,856 --> 00:30:40,231
Speech! Speech!

614
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,981
Speech! Speech! Speech!

615
00:30:49,687 --> 00:30:52,020
Eh! We let Sylvain speak.

616
00:30:52,675 --> 00:30:54,009
Come on.

617
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,145
Th... Thanks...

618
00:31:03,064 --> 00:31:04,273
It's good, Sylvain, it's good.

619
00:31:04,298 --> 00:31:05,964
- Great.
- Bravo!

620
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,284
You're at home here, OK?

621
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:13,476
Today, you are the king.
You sit at the head of the table.

622
00:31:14,284 --> 00:31:17,240
He has the right, this is his first day.
Tomorrow, we will take back our places.

623
00:31:17,265 --> 00:31:18,890
Come on, let's start.

624
00:31:20,255 --> 00:31:22,380
Are you hungry?

625
00:31:22,935 --> 00:31:24,143
Sylvain, carrots?

626
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,473
What's that?

627
00:31:33,981 --> 00:31:35,730
This is, uh...

628
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:38,176
- Moussaka.
- Moussaka.

629
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,088
Oh, OK.

630
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:46,070
With Alice, we have a great bond.

631
00:31:46,397 --> 00:31:47,939
We have the same humor,

632
00:31:48,054 --> 00:31:50,137
the same conversation subjects.

633
00:31:50,762 --> 00:31:52,845
We are on the same wavelength.

634
00:31:53,716 --> 00:31:56,507
She has this terrible little thing, see?

635
00:31:57,328 --> 00:31:58,953
When she gets angry,

636
00:31:59,513 --> 00:32:03,054
she has this little vein,
so cute that...

637
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:09,773
And I tell myself that it would be good
if we could move forward, she and I.

638
00:32:10,977 --> 00:32:13,768
You who have an outside perspective, Orpi,

639
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:16,559
do I have a chance or not?

640
00:32:16,981 --> 00:32:18,523
Huh? No.

641
00:32:19,443 --> 00:32:20,443
Damn.

642
00:32:25,501 --> 00:32:27,334
I see what you mean.

643
00:32:28,094 --> 00:32:31,052
It is true that it puts distance between us.

644
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,106
It is a form of modesty.

645
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,672
Come on, I'm going to pee.

646
00:32:36,277 --> 00:32:37,313
I'll wait for you!

647
00:32:37,587 --> 00:32:40,188
<i>From home,
we'll be 2 hours from Los Angeles.</i>

648
00:32:40,213 --> 00:32:42,729
<i>We take a plane and we'll be able to travel
around the United States.</i>

649
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:43,892
That's crazy.

650
00:32:44,116 --> 00:32:46,782
Even Yosemite Park, I told you about it.

651
00:32:47,086 --> 00:32:48,628
Yeah, it's cool.

652
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:51,951
<i>My love, we're going to be able
to do some crazy stuff.</i>

653
00:32:52,085 --> 00:32:55,039
Besides, you'll have to send me your papers.

654
00:32:55,386 --> 00:32:56,601
Yes, I'll do it.

655
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:58,726
This is the 10th time I've asked you.

656
00:32:58,751 --> 00:32:59,976
I'll do it.

657
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:02,084
<i>They are annoying with the paperwork.</i>

658
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:06,000
By the way, did you tell them
about your departure?

659
00:33:06,675 --> 00:33:09,300
Uh, no. I didn't have time.

660
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,580
You're annoying!
We've talked about it 10 times!

661
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:16,021
I know, yes. I'll tell them tomorrow.

662
00:33:16,472 --> 00:33:17,722
Tomorrow, yeah.

663
00:33:19,523 --> 00:33:21,231
- Tomorrow?
- Yes, I promise.

664
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:24,352
Tomorrow, because after that,
things will turn and turn,

665
00:33:24,383 --> 00:33:27,003
and after that, the
United States will be ours!

666
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:30,371
- It's gonna be wonderful. I can't wait.
- Yes, me too.

667
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:33,068
- I love you. It's from there.
- You're silly.

668
00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:34,926
- I love you.
- Me too. Kisses.

669
00:33:47,582 --> 00:33:48,789
Sylvain?

670
00:33:49,863 --> 00:33:51,238
What?

671
00:33:52,951 --> 00:33:55,576
You don't do the disabled too well.

672
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:58,492
What, I'm not doing it right?
You're kind...

673
00:33:58,826 --> 00:34:00,118
I'm just starting.

674
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,449
Do you want me to show you?

675
00:34:01,584 --> 00:34:02,841
Show me how to do it.

676
00:34:02,939 --> 00:34:06,980
The tongue is placed to the side.
At the edge of the lips.

677
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:12,032
And you try to lean... that way.

678
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,966
- Head tilted and tongue out?
- Yeah, that's it.

679
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:17,510
- Like this?
- Yes.

680
00:34:17,535 --> 00:34:18,672
That's a lot, isn't it?

681
00:34:18,697 --> 00:34:20,822
Note, that looks very handicapped.

682
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:22,816
And the voice?
What do I do with the voice?

683
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:25,924
For the voice,
we will learn to speak well.

684
00:34:28,363 --> 00:34:30,879
You can still talk, though.

685
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:32,153
Yeah. Sorry.

686
00:34:32,623 --> 00:34:34,003
And if I do it... like this?

687
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:35,373
That's fine.

688
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,490
Or... like this? Like this?

689
00:34:37,515 --> 00:34:38,932
There, I do it like that.

690
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,402
Maybe I can press it a little more.

691
00:34:41,427 --> 00:34:43,344
Yes, that's it.

692
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:47,474
What's going on here?
This is crazy!

693
00:34:47,735 --> 00:34:50,292
Often you move a little bit like this.

694
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:51,720
Well, yeah.

695
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,308
- That's it, right?
- Great.

696
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:55,663
It's great?

697
00:34:55,688 --> 00:34:56,629
Awsome.

698
00:34:57,157 --> 00:35:03,416
You have... to... help me...
find... a gift for... Marie.

699
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,594
Which one is Marie?

700
00:35:10,936 --> 00:35:12,270
Sylvain, I have to talk to you.

701
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:14,022
We have to... Anyway.

702
00:35:14,231 --> 00:35:16,879
You have to go pee
before you go to bed.

703
00:35:16,904 --> 00:35:17,872
Come on. I'm waiting.

704
00:35:17,897 --> 00:35:19,153
Hurry up.

705
00:35:20,107 --> 00:35:22,731
All right. And is that your lover, Marie?

706
00:35:23,074 --> 00:35:23,912
Oui.

707
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:25,264
Does she know it?

708
00:35:25,432 --> 00:35:27,641
No, she is not aware.

709
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,503
That's what I thought.

710
00:35:29,537 --> 00:35:31,007
But gifts are personal.

711
00:35:31,032 --> 00:35:32,740
- You have to find a gift.
- Yes.

712
00:35:33,471 --> 00:35:34,909
You want me to help you.

713
00:35:35,037 --> 00:35:36,537
Oh, yeah.

714
00:35:36,778 --> 00:35:39,349
OK... You know what?

715
00:35:39,961 --> 00:35:42,461
- If you don't want to help me...
- Yeah?

716
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:45,488
I tell everyone that you touch me.

717
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,518
That I touch you? You're crazy.
That I touch you?

718
00:35:48,759 --> 00:35:50,815
But it's not okay.
I never touched you.

719
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:52,799
And it's you who came in my shower.

720
00:35:52,824 --> 00:35:54,940
I'm the one who could say something.
This is not done between friends.

721
00:35:54,965 --> 00:35:57,237
We said we were friends.
This is not done between friends.

722
00:35:57,262 --> 00:35:59,193
This is blackmail, it's not good.

723
00:36:00,348 --> 00:36:02,890
- Come on.
- Come on. You were a good coach.

724
00:36:05,106 --> 00:36:06,406
What is it?

725
00:36:06,836 --> 00:36:08,128
We are in shit.

726
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:11,534
- Why are we?
- Because. Because...

727
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:15,214
I have to call Rico, but the problem is,
the mongolito broke my phone.

728
00:36:15,343 --> 00:36:17,093
I have to find a solution, I have to...

729
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,994
And the bag, where is it?

730
00:36:23,303 --> 00:36:26,136
The bag is... well protected,
believe me.

731
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,015
It will not move.

732
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,248
Hello.

733
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:39,550
There.

734
00:36:49,525 --> 00:36:50,524
There.

735
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:51,835
Good night.

736
00:36:52,173 --> 00:36:53,382
Bonne nuit.

737
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,652
Damn, that's not fair.

738
00:37:03,236 --> 00:37:04,527
What do we do?

739
00:37:04,797 --> 00:37:06,588
What do we do? What do we do?
We...

740
00:37:07,277 --> 00:37:09,485
We stay here, we don't move,
we don't move one ear.

741
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,880
You continue to do the mongolito,
like this...

742
00:37:11,905 --> 00:37:13,513
And then... I will find a solution.

743
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:15,540
There. That's what we'll do.

744
00:37:15,982 --> 00:37:18,106
- OK.
- Hey, hey!

745
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,285
They didn't spot you, have they?

746
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,553
They? Are you kidding me or what?
No, no.

747
00:37:23,669 --> 00:37:27,754
They don't see anything.
They told me, "You're just like us."

748
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:29,419
Yeah, huh?
Yeah.

749
00:37:33,637 --> 00:37:34,845
Everything is fine?

750
00:37:34,966 --> 00:37:37,674
Awsome. Marc Vador sleeps upstairs.

751
00:37:37,976 --> 00:37:39,857
And I met a bottle of ketchup

752
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,332
who was coming back from peeing.

753
00:37:41,574 --> 00:37:43,407
A normal evening, really.

754
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:46,874
- I'll serve you, huh? There.
- Thanks.

755
00:37:54,444 --> 00:37:57,443
I never asked you
why you became an educator.

756
00:37:58,089 --> 00:37:59,671
Ah, well...

757
00:38:01,507 --> 00:38:03,549
I was manager at La Défense,

758
00:38:03,604 --> 00:38:06,005
and then, one day,

759
00:38:07,038 --> 00:38:09,762
I was eating a bo bun on the esplanade

760
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,392
and a pigeon landed right in front of me.

761
00:38:12,507 --> 00:38:14,923
And it only had one leg.
- What?

762
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:17,665
It only had one leg.

763
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:20,962
And there, I said to myself...

764
00:38:21,523 --> 00:38:23,106
"Céline, this is a sign."

765
00:38:24,363 --> 00:38:25,904
"Take care of the disabled."

766
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,688
- OK.
- Life changing.

767
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:31,596
Come on.

768
00:38:32,027 --> 00:38:34,526
Speaking of which,
what are you going to say to your boyfriend?

769
00:38:34,716 --> 00:38:36,465
Oh, damn, I don't know.

770
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,891
Not "Go away alone",
he's been supporting me for years.

771
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:45,865
It will not be the same without you.

772
00:38:47,457 --> 00:38:50,123
I don't know how
I'm going to tell them.

773
00:38:51,051 --> 00:38:52,725
And there is a problem...

774
00:38:54,154 --> 00:38:56,112
you're going to break Marc's heart.

775
00:38:56,281 --> 00:38:57,698
Yeah, Marc.

776
00:38:58,206 --> 00:38:59,951
- You'll break his heart.
- Yes.

777
00:38:59,976 --> 00:39:01,147
- Alice.
- Yes?

778
00:39:01,896 --> 00:39:02,937
You're stupid!

779
00:39:03,172 --> 00:39:04,630
"Alice, look at me."

780
00:39:04,655 --> 00:39:06,072
"Alice, I'm here."

781
00:39:06,528 --> 00:39:08,185
"I will always be here."

782
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,293
"Alice, don't leave! My heart beats for you."

783
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:12,610
Arrête, arrête...

784
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:14,209
"Alice, take me!"

785
00:39:14,234 --> 00:39:16,359
You will wake up everyone!

786
00:39:17,001 --> 00:39:18,601
- It was too loud.
- Well, yeah, it's too loud.

787
00:39:18,626 --> 00:39:19,793
You're exaggerating.

788
00:39:25,518 --> 00:39:27,226
I can't hear you at all anymore.

789
00:39:27,341 --> 00:39:28,799
Your guy, do you love him?

790
00:39:29,798 --> 00:39:30,923
Well, yes, I love him.

791
00:39:31,104 --> 00:39:37,357
Well, going to the other side of the world with
the guy you love, there are worse projects.

792
00:39:37,964 --> 00:39:39,338
Yeah, I know.

793
00:39:40,407 --> 00:39:42,635
Mmh. You know, you know...
One wouldn't say.

794
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:43,963
Why are you saying this?

795
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:46,259
You have just torn off a whole field.

796
00:39:48,403 --> 00:39:49,778
Yes.

797
00:39:50,153 --> 00:39:51,529
Not wrong.

798
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:54,496
"Alice."

799
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,686
"I'm your guy."

800
00:40:18,452 --> 00:40:19,451
Oh, damn!

801
00:40:20,171 --> 00:40:21,202
Are you coming to play?

802
00:40:21,227 --> 00:40:22,852
- Oh, damn.
- Come on!

803
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:27,961
Orpi, come!

804
00:40:28,102 --> 00:40:30,019
Yes, yes, yes.

805
00:40:30,114 --> 00:40:31,822
- Is it going well?
- Awsome.

806
00:40:32,131 --> 00:40:33,565
- What are you doing, Ludo?
- A guy.

807
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,722
Oh, yes, great. And you, Thibaut?

808
00:40:35,931 --> 00:40:38,075
- A basketball court.
- Ah, yes, OK.

809
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:40,658
It's super-well done. Wow!

810
00:40:41,486 --> 00:40:43,236
- And you, Gad?
- Un sandwich.

811
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:46,856
Uh... You can't eat the salt dough. OK?

812
00:40:47,385 --> 00:40:50,077
- But I haven't eaten it.
- No, no, but I'm telling you just in case.

813
00:40:51,085 --> 00:40:54,252
- Sofian, what are you doing?
- A cap.

814
00:40:54,277 --> 00:40:54,985
A cap?

815
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:57,682
There, that's the tail.

816
00:40:57,707 --> 00:40:59,874
The tail of the cap?
The visor, you mean.

817
00:40:59,899 --> 00:41:01,493
Yes, the visor.

818
00:41:01,518 --> 00:41:04,532
Yeah, well, it doesn't look too much
like a cap.

819
00:41:04,557 --> 00:41:06,597
But go ahead, you'll get there.

820
00:41:08,344 --> 00:41:09,608
Sylvain.

821
00:41:09,813 --> 00:41:11,772
I have something to tell you.

822
00:41:12,608 --> 00:41:13,774
Yes, I'm listening.

823
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:16,424
There. I'm more in love with you.
I'm sorry.

824
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,861
Ah... oh my...

825
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:22,016
Oh, what a shame.

826
00:41:22,283 --> 00:41:24,394
Don't worry, you will get over it.

827
00:41:24,494 --> 00:41:26,273
It will take time, but...

828
00:41:26,298 --> 00:41:29,059
you'll get over it. Otherwise, suicide.

829
00:41:31,229 --> 00:41:32,354
OK...

830
00:41:36,056 --> 00:41:37,555
Orpi?

831
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:40,315
Look, it's a bird.

832
00:41:42,549 --> 00:41:44,798
Oh yeah, now that you mention it...

833
00:41:45,677 --> 00:41:46,969
I'm going to pee.

834
00:41:55,106 --> 00:41:56,104
Sylvain?

835
00:41:57,177 --> 00:41:58,177
How are you?

836
00:41:58,546 --> 00:42:00,142
I'm OK.

837
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:02,084
- Do you feel well?
- Yeah.

838
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:03,959
Do you like it, the activity?

839
00:42:04,541 --> 00:42:08,922
Yeah, it's a blast.
Salt dough, basically.

840
00:42:09,614 --> 00:42:11,281
Yes, it's salt dough.

841
00:42:13,457 --> 00:42:15,791
- Do you need to pee?
- No.

842
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:18,139
Are you autonomous in peeing?

843
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,472
Yes, I'm "tautonomous".

844
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,253
- It's the poop, then?
- No, it's nothing.

845
00:42:23,611 --> 00:42:27,288
- If you want I come with you.
- Come on, I gotta dry this. It has to dry.

846
00:42:31,748 --> 00:42:33,664
Damn, he's annoying, Marc.

847
00:42:33,872 --> 00:42:36,176
Yes, it's really incredible.

848
00:42:36,246 --> 00:42:37,552
Always behind...

849
00:42:37,577 --> 00:42:39,618
Did you find a gift for Marie?

850
00:42:40,498 --> 00:42:42,122
Oh, no, I haven't...

851
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,683
That's because I thought it would be
not bad for you to see her, first.

852
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:47,410
To tell her you like her.

853
00:42:48,493 --> 00:42:49,576
No.

854
00:42:49,658 --> 00:42:51,699
- Why?
- It's not possible.

855
00:42:51,781 --> 00:42:53,844
No, no...

856
00:42:54,462 --> 00:42:55,836
I can't.

857
00:42:56,326 --> 00:42:58,010
- Arnaud.
- I can't.

858
00:42:58,044 --> 00:42:59,096
Arnaud!

859
00:43:02,061 --> 00:43:03,174
Look.

860
00:43:03,472 --> 00:43:05,305
This is a bird.

861
00:43:05,873 --> 00:43:07,090
It's like bread.

862
00:43:07,234 --> 00:43:10,788
We put Nutella and lots of sugar.
See you later.

863
00:43:12,362 --> 00:43:13,881
- See you later.
- Yes.

864
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:17,621
Oh yeah, yeah. We already...
We had a good talk, huh!

865
00:43:17,697 --> 00:43:19,521
No, Baptiste, stop!

866
00:43:19,613 --> 00:43:22,572
Stop already, I can't do it... Stop.

867
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:24,499
I can't make the knot.

868
00:43:24,608 --> 00:43:28,774
- Can you lend me your cell phone?
- I'm busy. Stop, Baptiste, really, I can't do it.

869
00:43:29,739 --> 00:43:31,690
Do you want the loop of the champions?

870
00:43:32,807 --> 00:43:34,586
Ok, Ronaldo, I'll show you.

871
00:43:34,751 --> 00:43:37,584
He makes a knot, like this.
A loop.

872
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:38,836
You have to go through again...

873
00:43:38,904 --> 00:43:40,973
Exactly. You go back through it.

874
00:43:40,998 --> 00:43:43,016
And snap, the loop of the champions.

875
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:46,705
- Can you lend me your cell phone now?
- Yes, yes. Of course.

876
00:43:47,347 --> 00:43:49,013
- Bravo.
- Thanks.

877
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:51,741
Flawless.

878
00:43:51,766 --> 00:43:53,391
Look at what I did!

879
00:43:54,621 --> 00:43:57,387
Yeah. It's pretty. What is it?

880
00:43:57,486 --> 00:43:58,819
A wind turbine.

881
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:00,331
All right.

882
00:44:00,879 --> 00:44:04,756
Maybe you need to add a mast,
or other blades, to make it more...

883
00:44:04,781 --> 00:44:07,556
No, it's very good like this.
I'll show it to Gad.

884
00:44:07,581 --> 00:44:10,997
No, no. No, don't show it to Gad.
Because...

885
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:14,622
Because it's not models that Gad likes.

886
00:44:14,647 --> 00:44:16,990
- OK.
- Oh, no!

887
00:44:17,301 --> 00:44:20,537
No, no! It's confusing,
but I didn't do that.

888
00:44:20,562 --> 00:44:21,964
Oh, but you know,
it's great, Sylvain.

889
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:25,061
The idea is to express yourself.
You do what you want.

890
00:44:25,681 --> 00:44:26,705
Yes, but it's not me.

891
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,962
- We express ourselves freely!
- We express ourselves freely!

892
00:44:30,096 --> 00:44:32,433
Listen to Ludo. We express ourselves freely,
we do what we want.

893
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:34,188
I made a heart.

894
00:44:36,488 --> 00:44:37,835
Why do you laugh?

895
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,284
Are you in love with Alice?

896
00:44:39,528 --> 00:44:41,743
- I'm not, what are you...
- When is marriage?

897
00:44:41,939 --> 00:44:43,272
I'm not in love...

898
00:44:43,408 --> 00:44:46,074
I'm not in love with Alice, I'm not.
Ha, ha, so funny!

899
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,893
Continue your sausage there.
Here, I give this back to you.

900
00:44:52,244 --> 00:44:53,474
Did your grandfather teach you that?

901
00:44:53,499 --> 00:44:56,290
No, it was all me, I trained...

902
00:44:56,431 --> 00:44:57,430
Cool. Cool.

903
00:44:57,455 --> 00:44:59,761
- Alice, come and see!
- Self-taught...

904
00:44:59,984 --> 00:45:02,887
Yeah? Oh, my, what did you do, Ludo?

905
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,165
A man.

906
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:06,982
- All right. Is that the head?
- It's the head.

907
00:45:07,182 --> 00:45:08,449
And what is this?

908
00:45:08,474 --> 00:45:10,015
- The balls!
- OK.

909
00:45:11,488 --> 00:45:13,112
At least one small bar...

910
00:45:19,548 --> 00:45:21,361
- Hello?
- This is The Strawberry.

911
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:24,704
<i>No, sir. It's not ready yet.
I don't have all the parts.</i>

912
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:27,245
I'll keep you posted. Bye.

913
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,559
Damn. Fuck you.

914
00:45:32,905 --> 00:45:33,904
A little coffee?

915
00:45:37,325 --> 00:45:39,362
Honestly, your Dalida is very well done.

916
00:45:39,387 --> 00:45:41,027
Oh, yeah? That's great.

917
00:45:41,103 --> 00:45:43,719
- Oh, yeah. I made a heart.
- Me, the cock.

918
00:45:43,897 --> 00:45:46,908
- You are really talented. Really.
- Thank you, that's kind.

919
00:45:48,107 --> 00:45:49,719
There you go, you've
made some friends.

920
00:45:49,764 --> 00:45:51,105
It's cool, I'm pleased.

921
00:45:52,194 --> 00:45:54,302
Yeah, it's cool.
Thank you.

922
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,910
Come on, the starters.

923
00:45:56,935 --> 00:46:00,213
The starters! The starters! The starters!

924
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:03,671
The starters! The starters! The starters!

925
00:46:04,038 --> 00:46:05,455
Celery remoulade.

926
00:46:09,158 --> 00:46:12,859
- What is this?
- Uh... I no longer remember.

927
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:14,761
- Lasagna.
- There, lasagna.

928
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:16,347
Hop, thank you.

929
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:19,100
No, that's enough. I'm careful.

930
00:46:19,241 --> 00:46:22,033
Good, well... Bon appetit, anyway.

931
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,182
Ah, it disgusts me.

932
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:28,918
It's disgusting.

933
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:35,766
- Let's go?
- Beurk, it's disgusting.

934
00:46:36,246 --> 00:46:38,641
- Don't you want to taste it?
- No, it's disgusting.

935
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:39,833
You taste it.

936
00:46:42,398 --> 00:46:43,522
My Soso.

937
00:46:43,892 --> 00:46:45,991
- Yes, what?
- I just got your mom on the phone.

938
00:46:46,016 --> 00:46:48,598
Oh yeah, so? When is she coming?

939
00:46:49,549 --> 00:46:52,464
Uh... It's going to be complicated
with her new job and all.

940
00:46:52,489 --> 00:46:54,073
I'm not sure she'll come.

941
00:46:54,644 --> 00:46:56,811
Ah. OK.

942
00:46:58,304 --> 00:46:59,929
It doesn't matter.

943
00:47:02,908 --> 00:47:06,845
And you, why did your
parents put you in the center?

944
00:47:07,028 --> 00:47:09,020
- Because you're shit!
- No, Ludovic.

945
00:47:09,045 --> 00:47:11,045
Let him answer, please. Okay?

946
00:47:18,871 --> 00:47:20,829
My mom is dead.

947
00:47:21,193 --> 00:47:22,443
Sorry, we didn't know.

948
00:47:22,468 --> 00:47:23,969
That's OK.

949
00:47:26,399 --> 00:47:28,190
And my father, it's...

950
00:47:29,864 --> 00:47:30,863
It's complicated.

951
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,840
He wanted me to be like him, but I...

952
00:47:35,948 --> 00:47:38,323
mais il acceptera jamais que je sois...

953
00:47:38,637 --> 00:47:39,971
I'm different.

954
00:47:43,053 --> 00:47:44,950
But we are with you.

955
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:48,179
Thank you, Soso.

956
00:47:49,591 --> 00:47:51,257
My mom, she is...

957
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:53,530
very nice to me.

958
00:47:53,915 --> 00:47:57,998
And uh... Also, she alowed me...

959
00:48:02,888 --> 00:48:06,513
My mother allowed me to come...

960
00:48:07,122 --> 00:48:11,581
And my father didn't want to keep me.

961
00:48:12,024 --> 00:48:16,036
And that's when she got a brain tumor.

962
00:48:17,028 --> 00:48:18,986
And after her brain tumor,

963
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:20,707
my mother is dead.

964
00:48:21,421 --> 00:48:24,753
I cried a lot and I think a lot about her.

965
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,219
And it's very hard for me.

966
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:39,869
A Santa Claus?

967
00:48:40,457 --> 00:48:41,414
A robot?

968
00:48:41,439 --> 00:48:42,997
- A rifle?
- Hot air balloon?

969
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:45,334
A 12 calibre?
A 12 calibre!

970
00:48:45,396 --> 00:48:46,771
- A dick!
- Well done, Ludo!

971
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,172
Hello, Mr. Gendarme.

972
00:48:50,829 --> 00:48:52,728
- Léon Zitrone?
- Yes.

973
00:48:52,857 --> 00:48:54,398
Elton John! Elton John!

974
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:55,567
I didn't sing!

975
00:48:55,592 --> 00:48:57,132
That was easy, honestly.

976
00:48:57,357 --> 00:48:59,101
Yes, it's me, the vampire.

977
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:13,862
It's Rambo!

978
00:49:16,517 --> 00:49:18,016
Come on, somebody else.

979
00:49:18,225 --> 00:49:20,223
- Demis Roussos.
- Lagy Gaga!

980
00:49:26,098 --> 00:49:27,698
Non, c'est pas Macron!

981
00:49:27,723 --> 00:49:29,472
- Michael Jackson?
- Yes.

982
00:49:29,581 --> 00:49:30,873
Sarkozy, oui!

983
00:49:33,573 --> 00:49:34,254
Silence!

984
00:49:34,279 --> 00:49:35,326
Your mouths!

985
00:49:35,492 --> 00:49:36,654
You're not stupid.

986
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:40,714
Sylvain, it's your turn.
You haven't been yet.

987
00:49:40,739 --> 00:49:43,538
Ah, you're hiding.
Look, no one will judge you.

988
00:49:43,616 --> 00:49:46,195
We're having fun, no one's going to...
how to say this?...

989
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,177
Fine, shut up.
OK, I'm going.

990
00:49:48,506 --> 00:49:50,483
- What did he say?
- Shut up.

991
00:49:51,262 --> 00:49:52,428
OK.

992
00:49:53,678 --> 00:49:55,140
It's good, he's comfortable.

993
00:49:55,165 --> 00:49:56,372
<i>A peanut?</i>

994
00:49:56,405 --> 00:49:58,484
<i>- Uh, Wonder Woman?
- A horse?</i>

995
00:49:58,509 --> 00:50:00,026
Someone who phones, isn't it?

996
00:50:00,051 --> 00:50:02,525
<i>- A hen?
- Yes, that's it, it's a hen!</i>

997
00:50:02,723 --> 00:50:05,042
- Another one.
- Look at the other badger.

998
00:50:06,478 --> 00:50:08,353
<i>- Ludovic!
- Ananas?</i>

999
00:50:08,691 --> 00:50:09,857
<i>Jean-Marie Le Pen.</i>

1000
00:50:09,982 --> 00:50:12,440
<i>- For sure, it's Ludovic!
- Supergirl!</i>

1001
00:50:12,649 --> 00:50:14,440
<i>Donald Trump?</i>

1002
00:50:14,742 --> 00:50:15,821
<i>He is good.</i>

1003
00:50:16,545 --> 00:50:18,796
<i>It's... a beautiful badger.</i>

1004
00:50:18,821 --> 00:50:21,506
No, it's not a badger, it's a dinosaur.

1005
00:50:22,817 --> 00:50:25,779
- Good... we leave you two minutes.
- No.

1006
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:28,468
- Yes, come.
- We'll watch the show!

1007
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:30,456
But you wanted to tell me something.

1008
00:50:30,735 --> 00:50:33,568
Let's go get some fresh air, Orpi,
a little bit.

1009
00:50:33,724 --> 00:50:35,890
Because now, Orpi is tired.

1010
00:50:36,045 --> 00:50:38,878
Orpi needs to get some fresh air. Huh?

1011
00:50:39,053 --> 00:50:40,427
Well, yes.

1012
00:50:40,812 --> 00:50:42,302
Are you stupid or what?

1013
00:50:42,461 --> 00:50:43,960
Eh, oh, eh, oh, eh!

1014
00:50:44,628 --> 00:50:45,919
How are you talking to me?

1015
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,805
What are you doing?

1016
00:50:48,468 --> 00:50:49,509
Hein?

1017
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,712
How do you talk to your father?

1018
00:50:52,654 --> 00:50:54,696
How do you talk to your father?

1019
00:50:56,496 --> 00:50:57,828
Attention.

1020
00:51:01,034 --> 00:51:02,367
Why are you doing this?

1021
00:51:02,542 --> 00:51:03,917
What is the goal?

1022
00:51:05,169 --> 00:51:07,127
I'm fucking sick of this.

1023
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:09,555
I'm sick of it...

1024
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:13,355
All this, the shitty countryside...

1025
00:51:13,498 --> 00:51:15,929
It's okay, I'm not an educator.
You're...

1026
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:19,750
You're not a mongol, either.
You're not mentally retarded.

1027
00:51:20,017 --> 00:51:21,559
So what do we do?

1028
00:51:21,708 --> 00:51:23,832
We're here for a week.
What are we doing?

1029
00:51:25,413 --> 00:51:29,330
If you want to pull a face, do it.
I want to enjoy it.

1030
00:51:29,995 --> 00:51:32,953
Ah, wait, wait.
I see you.

1031
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:36,580
Little Alice?

1032
00:51:38,092 --> 00:51:40,342
Do you want to kiss her?
Do you want to ki...

1033
00:51:40,411 --> 00:51:44,660
- Look at yourself.
- Fuck her. Be a good man.

1034
00:51:58,767 --> 00:52:00,757
Why are you looking at my body?

1035
00:52:00,881 --> 00:52:02,663
It's none of your business,
put on your t-shirt.

1036
00:52:02,688 --> 00:52:04,480
Okay, I'll manage.

1037
00:52:04,668 --> 00:52:06,765
- How's your little injury, Marie?
- It's very good.

1038
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,498
- Can I have a look?
- Go ahead.

1039
00:52:09,013 --> 00:52:10,929
My beloved nurse.

1040
00:52:12,528 --> 00:52:14,487
I'm sick of all this.

1041
00:52:14,736 --> 00:52:17,944
I'm not the one who's going to wipe you.
It's fine, yeah.

1042
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:21,291
Not able to manage on your own...
I swear to you, if...

1043
00:52:21,316 --> 00:52:24,028
- Is all going well?
- Yes, great.

1044
00:52:24,765 --> 00:52:25,764
You're OK?

1045
00:52:27,406 --> 00:52:30,945
It's been three days already,
Sylvain's adaptation is going well.

1046
00:52:31,238 --> 00:52:32,530
Awesome, yeah.

1047
00:52:32,745 --> 00:52:35,170
- So I think you can leave him.
- No.

1048
00:52:37,035 --> 00:52:38,302
No. No, uh...

1049
00:52:38,561 --> 00:52:39,486
Yes.

1050
00:52:39,511 --> 00:52:40,553
But...

1051
00:52:40,993 --> 00:52:43,908
I don't know, I was thinking maybe
I can be of help if I...

1052
00:52:44,734 --> 00:52:47,449
For example, with...
- Baptiste?

1053
00:52:47,473 --> 00:52:53,524
Baptiste. We have We have a real bond,
there's something happening that's cool.

1054
00:52:53,872 --> 00:52:56,914
Would you be happy
if Orpi stayed with us?

1055
00:52:57,614 --> 00:53:01,071
Uh... Yes, I get along very well with him.

1056
00:53:04,165 --> 00:53:07,831
Good, well, great.
However, I can't pay you.

1057
00:53:09,615 --> 00:53:12,281
Don't tell me you're doing this
for the money?

1058
00:53:12,896 --> 00:53:13,895
The same.

1059
00:53:18,187 --> 00:53:22,061
Hey, oh!
You forgot me, you bunch of idiots.

1060
00:53:23,362 --> 00:53:25,601
You manage really great.

1061
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:28,110
- J'ai écrit "Sylvain".
- It's great.

1062
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,150
Who is Nicolas?

1063
00:53:31,278 --> 00:53:32,707
Nicolas was, uh...

1064
00:53:33,723 --> 00:53:35,848
He was a boarder, like you.

1065
00:53:37,215 --> 00:53:39,473
Like you, he had
a little something extra.

1066
00:53:39,498 --> 00:53:41,483
His little extra something was an illness.

1067
00:53:42,259 --> 00:53:44,467
The disease was stronger than him.

1068
00:53:45,799 --> 00:53:50,749
We engrave our names to have
a trace of those who are no longer here.

1069
00:53:53,657 --> 00:53:54,657
Orpi?

1070
00:53:55,222 --> 00:53:56,531
It's your turn.

1071
00:53:56,655 --> 00:53:59,562
No, it's OK, I'm past the age
to have my name on a tree.

1072
00:54:02,327 --> 00:54:03,786
- Are you coming?
- Yes.

1073
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,740
Be careful.

1074
00:54:09,971 --> 00:54:11,137
It's good?

1075
00:54:11,721 --> 00:54:14,179
- Are you okay, Sylvain?
- Excellent.

1076
00:54:15,811 --> 00:54:17,435
Hey, guys!

1077
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,921
We're going shopping with Marc.

1078
00:54:21,109 --> 00:54:23,771
For the next two hours it's Céline
and Orpi who take care of you.

1079
00:54:23,796 --> 00:54:25,339
- Be cool, OK?
- Yes, of course.

1080
00:54:25,676 --> 00:54:30,426
My mother and I always went
shopping together.

1081
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,559
I loved it.

1082
00:54:33,959 --> 00:54:35,136
Alice!

1083
00:54:35,161 --> 00:54:36,671
On peut venir avec Soso?
Shopping?

1084
00:54:36,696 --> 00:54:38,613
- Yeah, me too!
- Wait.

1085
00:54:39,134 --> 00:54:40,066
Me too!

1086
00:54:41,413 --> 00:54:43,499
Not everyone.
We only have four seats in the car.

1087
00:54:43,524 --> 00:54:47,590
So the first: Soso, Sylvain,
Arnaud and Ludovic. You can come.

1088
00:54:49,817 --> 00:54:51,589
Sylvain, Sylvain.

1089
00:54:53,966 --> 00:54:56,265
You're not going to go.
No, because they'll...

1090
00:54:56,379 --> 00:54:57,608
They'll see you.

1091
00:54:57,908 --> 00:55:01,472
You risk being seen, being made fun of.
People will see your face.

1092
00:55:01,818 --> 00:55:04,229
Yeah, it's true. But I'll take the risk.

1093
00:55:04,465 --> 00:55:06,424
- Huh?
- Let's go shopping! Let's go!

1094
00:55:06,664 --> 00:55:08,987
Céline, can you manage the meditation workshop?

1095
00:55:09,012 --> 00:55:10,828
No, wait, can we do something else instead?

1096
00:55:10,853 --> 00:55:13,228
No, we talked about this,
it does them a lot of good.

1097
00:55:13,384 --> 00:55:15,927
No, it pisses everyone off.

1098
00:55:15,959 --> 00:55:19,085
- And besides, meditation not my thing at all.
- Thank you, Sylvain.

1099
00:55:19,146 --> 00:55:21,521
- Oh, yeah, what is your thing?
- Hunting.

1100
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,800
- Hunting?
- Well, yeah!

1101
00:55:23,825 --> 00:55:25,667
I love hunting. Bang!

1102
00:55:26,682 --> 00:55:27,835
I love it.

1103
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:30,583
It's funny, you're not easy to understand,
Céline.

1104
00:55:31,362 --> 00:55:32,689
You are surprizing.

1105
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:35,218
You have a lot of facets.
- Merci.

1106
00:55:35,406 --> 00:55:37,822
Orpi, then you manage meditation?

1107
00:55:38,171 --> 00:55:39,385
Medi...? Yeah, oh, well...

1108
00:55:39,664 --> 00:55:42,022
Yeah, no... No problem, I love it.

1109
00:55:42,114 --> 00:55:44,014
Ok, awesome. Great.

1110
00:55:44,165 --> 00:55:46,751
And did you get the transfer
from Sylvain's father?

1111
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:47,776
No.

1112
00:55:47,872 --> 00:55:49,289
We have to take care of that.

1113
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:53,009
Because the other one doesn't call back,
yeah, yeah. No, no, you're...

1114
00:55:53,034 --> 00:55:54,305
- Are you handling this?
- Yeah.

1115
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:57,412
OK, thanks a lot.
See you later, everyone.

1116
00:55:59,179 --> 00:56:01,777
Thibaut, what are you doing with that cow?

1117
00:56:01,995 --> 00:56:04,557
Celine, handle the cow for me, please!

1118
00:56:04,582 --> 00:56:07,040
Yeah, yeah... What's with this cow?

1119
00:56:07,369 --> 00:56:10,993
Oh, my, Thibaut.
Where did you catch it? Come on.

1120
00:56:11,341 --> 00:56:13,331
Bijou, come. Come on, come.

1121
00:56:13,446 --> 00:56:16,279
- Thibaut, we have no room.
- Come, Thibaut!

1122
00:56:16,783 --> 00:56:18,926
- No, we can't.
- Oh, she's running!

1123
00:56:18,951 --> 00:56:20,217
Should I come forward?

1124
00:56:20,242 --> 00:56:23,783
- We don't have to close.
- We do what we can.

1125
00:56:24,646 --> 00:56:26,806
- Are you sure?
- It'll be fine.

1126
00:56:26,831 --> 00:56:28,505
No belt, it rings.

1127
00:56:28,704 --> 00:56:30,078
Tell me...

1128
00:56:31,708 --> 00:56:34,208
This meditation, what do you do?

1129
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:37,016
- It's how Alice said.
- OK, but what is it?

1130
00:56:37,052 --> 00:56:38,761
Well, meditation...

1131
00:56:38,864 --> 00:56:42,281
You talk to trees, you breathe...
Faggot stuff.

1132
00:56:43,857 --> 00:56:44,982
Oh, yeah?

1133
00:56:45,365 --> 00:56:49,698
And it's funny, because when you talk,
it doesn't sound like how you're dressed.

1134
00:56:49,946 --> 00:56:52,487
Anyway, I'm saying you're not the same inside
as you are outside.

1135
00:56:53,011 --> 00:56:55,302
It's best to close your eyes.

1136
00:56:55,729 --> 00:56:59,777
Like that, when we close our eyes,
well, we...

1137
00:57:01,847 --> 00:57:03,805
we see better inside... ourselves.

1138
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:05,080
OK?

1139
00:57:05,544 --> 00:57:06,834
There.

1140
00:57:06,859 --> 00:57:09,594
So we close our eyes.
We do it well.

1141
00:57:09,825 --> 00:57:12,575
And then, there you go, we...

1142
00:57:15,279 --> 00:57:16,375
relax.

1143
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,869
Huh?

1144
00:57:18,337 --> 00:57:19,628
We breathe.

1145
00:57:20,367 --> 00:57:22,076
Because breathing...

1146
00:57:22,716 --> 00:57:25,884
it's... it's compulsory, otherwise we die.

1147
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:27,082
So, uh...

1148
00:57:27,246 --> 00:57:29,078
we breathe deeply.

1149
00:57:32,128 --> 00:57:33,127
There.

1150
00:57:37,289 --> 00:57:38,700
Damn, it's boring.

1151
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:41,760
It's true that it's boring at some point!

1152
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:44,077
Oh, yeah, I told you. We get pissed off.

1153
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:01,351
Why don't you park in a "disabled" spot?

1154
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,812
I don't have the macaroon.

1155
00:58:03,087 --> 00:58:06,712
With the four of us, you have
a beautiful box of macaroons.

1156
00:58:07,071 --> 00:58:08,242
You're right.

1157
00:58:08,726 --> 00:58:12,116
- Marc, would you do me a service?
- Yes, I am here, I will always be here.

1158
00:58:12,141 --> 00:58:14,139
There was a Jardiland
in the industrial area.

1159
00:58:14,164 --> 00:58:15,524
- Yeah.
- Can you get me...

1160
00:58:15,549 --> 00:58:17,414
- You want flowers?
- No. Soil.

1161
00:58:17,439 --> 00:58:19,235
- For the flowers?
- No, for the vegetable garden.

1162
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:20,451
- For the vegetable garden?
- Yes.

1163
00:58:20,476 --> 00:58:22,556
- Take three bags.
- OK.

1164
00:58:23,182 --> 00:58:24,598
It's as good as done!

1165
00:58:25,285 --> 00:58:26,868
And we meet there?

1166
00:58:27,238 --> 00:58:28,922
Otherwise, you pick me up,
it's just at the...

1167
00:58:28,947 --> 00:58:31,530
The idea is not to exceed the list.

1168
00:58:31,555 --> 00:58:33,117
- OK.
- OK.

1169
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:35,330
We start with vegetables?

1170
00:58:35,355 --> 00:58:38,422
- It's you, the vegetable!
- We're all vegetables.

1171
00:58:38,447 --> 00:58:41,312
- It's you, the vegetable!
- Ok, that's fine, we got it, Ludo.

1172
00:58:58,664 --> 00:59:00,464
Why do people look at us?

1173
00:59:00,489 --> 00:59:03,342
- We annoy them!
- We annoy them!

1174
00:59:06,683 --> 00:59:07,533
We annoy you!

1175
00:59:08,492 --> 00:59:09,931
- With this?
- That'll be all.

1176
00:59:09,956 --> 00:59:11,122
Thanks.

1177
00:59:11,873 --> 00:59:13,674
It's good, it's too good.

1178
00:59:14,465 --> 00:59:17,256
Mmm... It smells good.

1179
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,693
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1180
00:59:20,756 --> 00:59:22,380
We'll eat them afterwards.

1181
00:59:22,834 --> 00:59:26,206
- Pardon me?
- We eat the melons, you have to avoid...

1182
00:59:26,274 --> 00:59:28,835
You have to be stupid to eat
the skin of a melon! That's stupid!

1183
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,216
- Well, yeah.
- He's right.

1184
00:59:30,329 --> 00:59:32,437
You don't normally eat the skin.

1185
00:59:32,462 --> 00:59:34,337
You're right. The gentleman is stupid.

1186
00:59:34,479 --> 00:59:35,644
He's stupid.

1187
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,461
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

1188
00:59:39,778 --> 00:59:41,954
- Bite into it! Bite into it!
- It's okay, it's good.

1189
00:59:41,979 --> 00:59:44,325
Oh, he's upset. Goodbye, stupid.

1190
00:59:44,611 --> 00:59:46,236
- Goodbye, stupid.
- Goodbye, stupid.

1191
00:59:47,103 --> 00:59:48,852
Bye!

1192
00:59:51,228 --> 00:59:52,309
Shit, Soso.

1193
00:59:52,566 --> 00:59:55,192
Don't worry, everybody knows.

1194
00:59:55,767 --> 00:59:56,934
Who told him?

1195
00:59:56,959 --> 00:59:59,335
- It's not us.
- It's not us.

1196
00:59:59,483 --> 01:00:00,753
It's Alexandre.

1197
01:00:02,064 --> 01:00:03,497
Who told Alexandre?

1198
01:00:03,522 --> 01:00:05,307
- That's us.
- That's us.

1199
01:00:05,516 --> 01:00:07,235
We don't tell the educators, OK?

1200
01:00:07,345 --> 01:00:08,720
- No.
- Yes.

1201
01:00:09,243 --> 01:00:10,943
- Come on!
- Wow!

1202
01:00:10,968 --> 01:00:13,611
- Come on!
- Go ahead, Baptiste!

1203
01:00:13,749 --> 01:00:16,106
- Come on, Baptiste!
- Orpi, catch!

1204
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,071
Come on!

1205
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:20,257
Come on, Alex! Come on!

1206
01:00:20,388 --> 01:00:21,715
There! Go back!

1207
01:00:22,574 --> 01:00:24,824
Yes! Go, alone, alone!

1208
01:00:29,658 --> 01:00:31,137
- Holy cow!
- Marie, are you okay?

1209
01:00:31,162 --> 01:00:32,235
Attention. Are you OK?

1210
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:34,048
The greens, not the reds!

1211
01:00:34,399 --> 01:00:36,136
Are you gonna be okay?
Can you breathe?

1212
01:00:36,261 --> 01:00:39,133
Breathe. Look at me. Look at me.

1213
01:00:40,072 --> 01:00:41,927
Come on, you're OK.
We're going to win.

1214
01:00:42,286 --> 01:00:43,301
Yes, hello?

1215
01:00:43,509 --> 01:00:44,967
Wait... Hello?

1216
01:00:45,138 --> 01:00:47,430
Wait... Wait, I can't hear anything.

1217
01:00:47,645 --> 01:00:50,044
Oh, no, no, there is no Strawberry here,
you got the wrong number.

1218
01:00:50,069 --> 01:00:53,008
Yes, wait. No. Excuse me.

1219
01:00:53,033 --> 01:00:54,617
- Wait, I'll pass him to you.
- Yes. No...

1220
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:56,130
It's me...

1221
01:00:56,155 --> 01:01:00,453
Strawberry, in fact, is Sylvain's dad
who is calling me. Yes.

1222
01:01:00,853 --> 01:01:02,057
We resume!

1223
01:01:02,257 --> 01:01:03,090
Rico, I'm listening.

1224
01:01:03,115 --> 01:01:04,798
Listen to me, the cops don't let go.

1225
01:01:04,823 --> 01:01:06,606
<i>I have a hideout for you in Spain.</i>

1226
01:01:06,631 --> 01:01:08,898
We are doing the paperwork,
wait a few days.

1227
01:01:10,088 --> 01:01:11,715
Ouh! It's good, that!

1228
01:01:11,951 --> 01:01:14,492
Good, come on, come on! Oh! Come on!

1229
01:01:14,775 --> 01:01:16,400
We go back! Let's go!

1230
01:01:16,629 --> 01:01:18,838
<i>Are you sending me your pay slips?</i>

1231
01:01:18,863 --> 01:01:20,529
Yes, I'm going to do it.

1232
01:01:20,962 --> 01:01:23,254
<i>Yes, I already manage everything...</i>

1233
01:01:23,461 --> 01:01:26,919
Okay, but I'm not on vacation here. OK?

1234
01:01:27,668 --> 01:01:29,293
<i>Did you tell them, by the way?</i>

1235
01:01:30,534 --> 01:01:32,866
- Yes.
<i>- Damn, Alice!</i>

1236
01:01:33,134 --> 01:01:37,599
I'll tell them tonight, that's for sure.
I promise you.

1237
01:01:41,063 --> 01:01:43,017
Hello, ma'am, this is "priority checkout".

1238
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:44,609
Yes, I saw, thanks a lot.

1239
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:46,628
You can't see that it's priority.

1240
01:01:47,367 --> 01:01:50,826
And there, can you see them?
Are we priority enough for you?

1241
01:01:50,851 --> 01:01:52,810
Let the disabled pass!

1242
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:54,417
Attention, ma'am.

1243
01:01:55,924 --> 01:01:59,020
That's good, it's a gun. Bang, bang!

1244
01:02:02,925 --> 01:02:04,425
Are you okay, ma'am?

1245
01:02:05,962 --> 01:02:07,421
Ma'am? Are you OK?

1246
01:02:09,072 --> 01:02:10,571
Oui. Euh...

1247
01:02:11,863 --> 01:02:13,529
You didn't weigh your carrots.

1248
01:02:13,876 --> 01:02:15,667
- OK.
- I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it.

1249
01:02:15,702 --> 01:02:17,909
- Are you sure? Do you know how to do it?
- Yes.

1250
01:02:18,778 --> 01:02:21,435
Come, we continue to empty the cart, guys.

1251
01:02:33,738 --> 01:02:35,987
Try to put everything in one place.

1252
01:02:38,669 --> 01:02:40,919
- How are you? Did it go well?
- Yeah.

1253
01:02:41,247 --> 01:02:43,455
Here, there's this left. This...

1254
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:45,863
Oh, damn. We forgot the soil.

1255
01:02:46,085 --> 01:02:47,876
Oh, damn. We forgot Marc.

1256
01:02:49,209 --> 01:02:50,459
I have to go look for him.

1257
01:02:50,581 --> 01:02:53,580
It doesn't matter. We're not going to
do the vegetable garden now.

1258
01:02:53,762 --> 01:02:55,889
I'm not talking about the soil,
I'm talking about Marc.

1259
01:02:55,961 --> 01:02:57,262
Oh, yes, well, no...

1260
01:02:57,304 --> 01:02:59,638
He's a big boy, he'll manage by himself.

1261
01:02:59,663 --> 01:03:02,412
Everything is fine. So there...

1262
01:03:14,974 --> 01:03:18,390
Arnaud, can you sit next to me, please?

1263
01:03:20,221 --> 01:03:21,220
Sit down.

1264
01:03:33,632 --> 01:03:34,489
Speak.

1265
01:03:34,514 --> 01:03:35,513
Yeah.

1266
01:03:37,597 --> 01:03:39,264
Do you know Dalida?

1267
01:03:39,485 --> 01:03:41,567
Oui. Je l'aime pas.

1268
01:03:45,001 --> 01:03:46,376
Me neither.

1269
01:03:56,548 --> 01:03:57,713
Yes!

1270
01:04:01,386 --> 01:04:02,887
<i>- No.
- Please.</i>

1271
01:04:03,174 --> 01:04:04,633
Looks good.

1272
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:09,120
So? It's great.
It even has a little taste of...

1273
01:04:09,288 --> 01:04:10,287
My cock!

1274
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:14,079
There you go.
Really, you don't know what you're missing.

1275
01:04:14,213 --> 01:04:16,545
Is this brandade?
- Blanquette.

1276
01:04:16,667 --> 01:04:18,084
Blanquette brandade.

1277
01:04:18,562 --> 01:04:21,061
- You're missing me there.
- Oh, kitten, damn!

1278
01:04:21,739 --> 01:04:23,405
There you go, you're a handsome guy again.

1279
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,456

Alice.

1322
01:07:03,567 --> 01:07:04,676
Look at me.

1323
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:07,188
Damn, Marie.

- Oh, damn it!

1325

I didn't do it on purpose.

1326
01:07:11,436 --> 01:07:12,623
It went into her mouth.

1327
01:07:12,648 --> 01:07:14,682
It happens to her all the time.

1328
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:29,571
And there, there's a noise.

1329
01:07:29,642 --> 01:07:32,492
I hear something running and running
towards me.

1330
01:07:32,664 --> 01:07:33,372
It arrives,

1331
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:35,568
I feel it getting closer.

1332
01:07:35,886 --> 01:07:37,777
It's coming closer to me.
It's coming closer to me, Marie!

1333
01:07:37,802 --> 01:07:40,846
They are behind! They're behind!
They want to catch me!

1334
01:07:40,903 --> 01:07:41,948
What do I do?

1335
01:07:41,973 --> 01:07:44,098
You're annoying!
Always the same discussion.

1336
01:07:44,286 --> 01:07:45,897
Everything OK?
Are you enjoying yourself?

1337
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:48,337
Uh, no, as usual it's disgusting.

1338
01:07:48,362 --> 01:07:51,612
- I have an idea for your gift.
- Great, that's cool.

1339
01:07:51,789 --> 01:07:54,663
No, this is not possible!
He's going to score!

1340
01:07:54,999 --> 01:07:56,874
Yeah!

1341
01:07:57,741 --> 01:07:59,654
- You're not in prison.
- You're not in prison?

1342
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:01,212
- No, I...
- No, you're not in prison!

1343
01:08:01,237 --> 01:08:02,564
You're not in prison!

1344
01:08:02,841 --> 01:08:05,632
- Ah, I was afraid!
- Now you're in prison!

1345
01:08:08,623 --> 01:08:09,956
Sylvain, don't cheat!

1346
01:08:10,438 --> 01:08:12,188
Oh, no! I didn't mean to!

1347
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:14,957
- <i>That's great!</i>
- No big deal, it happens to her all the time.

1348
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:20,975
<i>Come. Come on!</i>

1349
01:08:21,213 --> 01:08:23,921
17, 18, 19. Good!

1350
01:08:23,976 --> 01:08:25,184
Your turn, Gad.

1351
01:08:25,828 --> 01:08:27,869
I'm going to bed.

1352
01:08:28,278 --> 01:08:30,236
Do you want to play another game?

1353
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:32,249
No, it's fine. Good night.

1354
01:08:32,422 --> 01:08:34,839
- Oh, well, good night.
- They are tired.

1355
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:37,934
A knight on a horse.
Do a knight for me.

1356
01:08:37,959 --> 01:08:39,340
I'm riding, I'm riding...

1357
01:08:39,365 --> 01:08:41,225
Oh! A princess!

1358
01:08:41,321 --> 01:08:42,513
Hello, princess.

1359
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,591
Will you accept me as...
Oh, no!

1360
01:08:46,037 --> 01:08:48,870
She doesn't want to.
So, I marry... I marry the ogre.

1361
01:08:49,078 --> 01:08:50,346
The ogre Ludo.

1362
01:08:50,371 --> 01:08:53,223
We go on horseback.
I'm getting on the horse, and there!

1363
01:08:53,593 --> 01:08:56,134
I don't know.
I don't know what to tell you.

1364
01:08:56,236 --> 01:08:58,671
Okay, go ahead. Fuck you.

1365
01:08:59,592 --> 01:09:01,175
And I knocked you down.

1366
01:09:01,330 --> 01:09:03,803
No, wait... Well, yes, yes!

1367
01:09:04,449 --> 01:09:05,740
Oh my!

1368
01:09:06,376 --> 01:09:09,292
You're very strong.
You're strong. You're strong.

1369
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:11,188
Come on, red.

1370
01:09:11,503 --> 01:09:14,253
Oh yeah, him, anyway.

1371
01:09:14,415 --> 01:09:16,580
Oh, yeah? He's a hottie too?

1372
01:09:18,146 --> 01:09:20,682
- Oh my! But what a goal!
- Did you see?

1373
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:23,011

Well, open it.

1383
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:55,675
- Wow!
- A jewel!

1384
01:09:55,706 --> 01:09:57,066
Happy birthday, Marie!

1385
01:09:57,231 --> 01:09:59,305
- That's well done. I wonder who made it.
- I want the same.

1386
01:09:59,655 --> 01:10:01,156
- You surprise me.
- Me too.

1387
01:10:08,286 --> 01:10:09,944
<i>Very good. Very good.</i>

1388
01:10:09,969 --> 01:10:11,528
- Is it good, your cake?
- Oh, yes. Delicious.

1389
01:10:11,553 --> 01:10:12,678
<i>Hello.</i>

1390
01:10:13,797 --> 01:10:14,797
Hello, hello.

1391
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:17,118
Good morning, everybody.

1392
01:10:17,143 --> 01:10:19,060
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1393
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:21,388
Who is this guy?

1394
01:10:21,413 --> 01:10:23,150
- Hello.
- Who is he?

1395
01:10:23,175 --> 01:10:25,043
- Uh, he's, uh...
<i>- It's your guy.</i>

1396
01:10:25,068 --> 01:10:27,869
It's Mathieu, it's my darling
who's giving me a surprise.

1397
01:10:27,987 --> 01:10:29,996
- Hello everybody. Delighted...
- Hello, Sébastien.

1398
01:10:30,021 --> 01:10:32,646
- Mathieu.
- Son of a bitch!

1399
01:10:33,457 --> 01:10:35,415
- Delighted.
- Ludovic, I told you about him.

1400
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,106
Ah, cool. Salut, Ludo.

1401
01:10:37,131 --> 01:10:39,603
It's the end of the world here.
I almost got lost three times at least.

1402
01:10:39,628 --> 01:10:41,856
- That's right, I was lost, lost.
<i>- Thank you!</i>

1403
01:10:42,052 --> 01:10:43,427
Go seek happiness.

1404
01:10:44,224 --> 01:10:45,474
Marie.

1405
01:10:46,149 --> 01:10:47,749
- OK.
- Why is he there?

1406
01:10:47,774 --> 01:10:50,281
Well, uh... I think he's making me...

1407
01:10:50,306 --> 01:10:51,807
A little surprise.

1408
01:10:52,134 --> 01:10:53,377
Are you OK, not too sad?

1409
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:55,264
- Sad about what?
- About what?

1410
01:10:55,289 --> 01:10:56,538
In fact, uh...

1411
01:10:57,939 --> 01:11:00,129
Mathieu found a job in the United States.

1412
01:11:00,154 --> 01:11:02,363
And I'm supposed to go with him.

1413
01:11:02,475 --> 01:11:05,223
But I was waiting until the end of the
week to announce

1414
01:11:05,248 --> 01:11:06,539
that I'm gonna leave you, but I...

1415
01:11:06,564 --> 01:11:08,814
- Shit. Didn't you tell them?
- No, I didn't tell them.

1416
01:11:08,953 --> 01:11:10,061
What, you're leaving?

1417
01:11:11,883 --> 01:11:13,467
<i>- Do not leave, no!
- Don't leave!</i>

1418
01:11:14,394 --> 01:11:16,103
No, no!

1419
01:11:16,128 --> 01:11:16,878
Eh, eh!

1420
01:11:16,969 --> 01:11:18,967
Stay with us, please!

1421
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:22,256
- It's not sure, kitten.
- Wait, wait. How is that, not sure?

1422
01:11:22,281 --> 01:11:24,960
- Are you sure you want to talk about it here?
- When exactly...

1423
01:11:24,985 --> 01:11:27,343
- You know what, we'll let you discuss.
- Yes.

1424
01:11:27,368 --> 01:11:30,535
And we are going to start a little workshop.

1425
01:11:30,822 --> 01:11:33,066
- Cooking!
- Cooking! Great idea!

1426
01:11:37,473 --> 01:11:39,931
For the green beans, grab it, hold it well.

1427
01:11:40,172 --> 01:11:42,062
You get it in, you turn.

1428
01:11:46,836 --> 01:11:50,459
- What are you doing here in the kitchen?
- We'll make a meal.

1429
01:11:50,928 --> 01:11:51,810
Oh yeah?

1430
01:11:51,835 --> 01:11:53,801
We're the ones making dinner tonight.

1431
01:11:53,826 --> 01:11:54,767
- Yes, it's us.
- Yeah.

1432
01:11:54,792 --> 01:11:57,669
Wait, nobody knows how to cook?

1433
01:11:57,694 --> 01:11:59,036
- We do too.
- Yes, yes.

1434
01:12:00,377 --> 01:12:02,293
Together we'll succeed.

1435
01:12:02,555 --> 01:12:03,888
We'll cook!

1436
01:12:03,989 --> 01:12:05,656
We'll make a home-cooked meal!

1437
01:12:05,943 --> 01:12:06,757
Home-cooked!

1438
01:12:06,782 --> 01:12:08,204
Get out! Beat it!

1439
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:10,603
We're fed up with canned goods!

1440
01:12:10,628 --> 01:12:12,247
We don't want cans any more!

1441
01:12:12,272 --> 01:12:14,425
We can cook, we want to cook.

1442
01:12:14,536 --> 01:12:16,027
Well, figure it out for yourself.

1443
01:12:17,196 --> 01:12:19,821
- Come on, Julien.
- Can I give a hand?

1444
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:22,717
Are you going to cook?

1445
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:25,043
Well, yeah.

1446
01:12:30,591 --> 01:12:31,882
Yeah, Julien!

1447
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:34,556
Where are the utensils?

1448
01:12:35,626 --> 01:12:38,376
- Let's get the utensils.
- My mother uses that.

1449
01:12:38,602 --> 01:12:40,018
I don't understand.

1450
01:12:40,712 --> 01:12:42,295
We've talked about it a thousand times.

1451
01:12:42,678 --> 01:12:44,287
Plus, you pushed me to apply.

1452
01:12:44,313 --> 01:12:47,104
I know, but it wasn't real at that time.

1453
01:12:47,711 --> 01:12:49,461
Damn, but Alice...

1454
01:12:49,595 --> 01:12:51,511
You're not going to do this
all your life, are you?

1455
01:12:51,706 --> 01:12:54,576
Wiping asses all your life
for a pittance?

1456
01:12:54,601 --> 01:12:56,997
Don't you understand that it's difficult,
that it's like my family?

1457
01:12:57,022 --> 01:12:58,109
You can't understand this.

1458
01:12:58,134 --> 01:13:00,317
Sorry, I thought I was your family.

1459
01:13:00,342 --> 01:13:01,341
Stop it.

1460
01:13:01,802 --> 01:13:04,844
If that's all there is, there are
plenty of disabled people there.

1461
01:13:06,527 --> 01:13:07,652
OK.

1462
01:13:08,635 --> 01:13:10,533
No, but... Alice.

1463
01:13:10,558 --> 01:13:13,807
You know what I mean, it's fine.
- Better go.

1464
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:16,491
- No, but Alice...
- Get lost.

1465
01:13:17,645 --> 01:13:19,311
Please, Mathieu. Get lost.

1466
01:13:48,601 --> 01:13:51,450
Perfect, if we want to eat tonight,
we have to get moving.

1467
01:13:51,547 --> 01:13:55,171
Come on, let's get back to it?
Come on, let's go.

1468
01:14:02,013 --> 01:14:03,583
- Alice?
- Yeah.

1469
01:14:03,608 --> 01:14:05,233
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, that's fine.

1470
01:14:06,368 --> 01:14:07,900
Orpi and Baptiste are back?

1471
01:14:08,409 --> 01:14:10,366
No, not yet. They will soon.

1472
01:14:10,484 --> 01:14:12,344
I'm here, Alice.
I'll always be here.

1473
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:13,456
Yeah, I know.

1474
01:14:13,955 --> 01:14:17,412
If you need, at some point,
somebody in your life... I...

1475
01:14:18,712 --> 01:14:20,878
There is always a moment
when we are not well,

1476
01:14:20,903 --> 01:14:23,529
and we need a shoulder to lean on,

1477
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,361
and I can be that shoulder.

1478
01:14:25,411 --> 01:14:27,244
Are you hitting on me?

1479
01:14:27,739 --> 01:14:29,651
I just broke up with my boyfriend
7 seconds ago and...

1480
01:14:29,676 --> 01:14:31,402
- No!
- ...and you thought, "This is good timing."

1481
01:14:31,427 --> 01:14:33,260
No, not at all! Not at all.

1482
01:14:33,959 --> 01:14:35,501
Not at all.
It's true that it seems so.

1483
01:14:35,526 --> 01:14:37,677
Afterwards, you tell yourself that it's...

1484
01:14:38,654 --> 01:14:40,234
No, imagine the embarrassment!

1485
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:45,562
<i>- What are onions?</i>
- They make you cry!

1486
01:14:45,589 --> 01:14:46,839
Yes!

1487
01:14:47,515 --> 01:14:48,682
I'm okay.

1488
01:14:48,789 --> 01:14:51,497
Watch your fingertips.
Here we go.

1489
01:14:51,572 --> 01:14:53,421
Let's make it flambé!

1490
01:14:54,757 --> 01:14:55,756
Attention!

1491
01:14:56,318 --> 01:14:57,656
Oh!

1492
01:14:58,645 --> 01:15:00,270
It's me, I'm making it flambé!

1493
01:15:21,297 --> 01:15:23,089
Vegetable farandole

1494
01:15:23,304 --> 01:15:26,720
on a bed of tagliatelle
a la puttanesca

1495
01:15:26,867 --> 01:15:29,784
with garden condiments.

1496
01:15:43,252 --> 01:15:44,613
Service!

1497
01:15:46,236 --> 01:15:49,069
Wow, great!

1498
01:15:50,848 --> 01:15:53,347
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Three plates at once?

1499
01:15:53,716 --> 01:15:56,091
Be careful not to drop them.

1500
01:15:56,516 --> 01:15:58,767
You have a nice shirt.
Who lent it to you?

1501
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:00,307
Uh... Alexandre.

1502
01:16:00,332 --> 01:16:02,706
It suits you very well.
You are very handsome.

1503
01:16:06,737 --> 01:16:07,821
Enjoy your food.

1504
01:16:08,763 --> 01:16:09,888
Thank you.

1505
01:16:09,913 --> 01:16:11,372
For once, it's good.

1506
01:16:12,123 --> 01:16:13,497
They're enjoying it.

1507
01:16:15,396 --> 01:16:17,646
- It's good, huh?
- I am not convinced by the texture.

1508
01:16:19,132 --> 01:16:21,728
It's good, chewing a little.

1509
01:16:29,049 --> 01:16:31,341
<i>- I scored 3 goals on you.
- OK, but...</i>

1510
01:16:31,507 --> 01:16:33,008
OK, but... I scored on you too.

1511
01:16:33,033 --> 01:16:35,004
- When you were in the posts...
- Not even!

1512
01:16:35,201 --> 01:16:38,326
Hey, hey! You should have been back
2 hours ago.

1513
01:16:38,847 --> 01:16:40,831
Yes, OK... We didn't see the time pass.

1514
01:16:40,856 --> 01:16:43,939
OK, fine, but he is under my responsibility.
If something happens...

1515
01:16:43,964 --> 01:16:45,439
- I go under his.
- There!

1516
01:16:45,464 --> 01:16:47,671
No, you're under my responsibility!
OK?

1517
01:16:47,696 --> 01:16:50,873
No... Wait. Honestly...
We were there, we were playing football.

1518
01:16:50,971 --> 01:16:53,232
- We went to eat a hotdog.
- Yes, it was good, huh?

1519
01:16:53,264 --> 01:16:55,745
- Was it good with mayo?
- Which was runny.

1520
01:16:55,957 --> 01:16:57,623
Hey, hey, I actually don't care!

1521
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:00,715
I'm busting my ass with the
activity programs, it's not for nothing!

1522
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:03,602
Are you talking about your
little coloring pages for kids? That's it?

1523
01:17:03,627 --> 01:17:05,709
- What?
- Mandala. It's called mandala.

1524
01:17:05,804 --> 01:17:09,266
The mandala? If you want!
The mandala is a clown thing.

1525
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:11,342
You're supposed to be an educator,
damn it!

1526
01:17:11,745 --> 01:17:14,077
You are not supposed
to do things like that!

1527
01:17:14,286 --> 01:17:16,994
Don't talk to me like that.
Nobody talks to me like that, get it?

1528
01:17:17,062 --> 01:17:18,271
<i>No, no, but...</i>

1529
01:17:18,392 --> 01:17:20,583
Let's-let's calm down.
Let's calm down.

1530
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:27,586
What Orpi means, is that he likes
outdoor activities. That's it.

1531
01:17:27,611 --> 01:17:30,211
That's why he's grumpy.
He's a country guy.

1532
01:17:30,236 --> 01:17:33,069
Yes. Well, yes... Sylvain is right.

1533
01:17:33,289 --> 01:17:34,633
Yeah, that's why.

1534
01:17:34,658 --> 01:17:37,818
Honestly, it's worth taking advantage
of all this.

1535
01:17:37,843 --> 01:17:40,064
Huh? Huh? Honestly, Baptiste?

1536
01:17:40,095 --> 01:17:42,799
Take advantage! Take advantage
of that, look! The prairie!

1537
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:45,900
That's right, after all this time doing
the same things we could go on a trip.

1538
01:17:45,925 --> 01:17:47,953
Well, coloring activities bore me.

1539
01:17:47,978 --> 01:17:50,620
Me too!
Not its place, not its place.

1540
01:17:50,645 --> 01:17:53,152
I too prefer excursions to activities!

1541
01:17:53,177 --> 01:17:54,265
OK.

1542
01:17:55,122 --> 01:17:57,223
Would you like to go on an trip?

1543
01:17:57,248 --> 01:17:59,255
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1544
01:18:02,727 --> 01:18:06,662
We will see Dalida's grave.

1545
01:18:06,687 --> 01:18:08,508
So, yes, why not?

1546
01:18:08,533 --> 01:18:10,060
But otherwise I have another idea.

1547
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:11,585
No hunting.

1548
01:18:14,327 --> 01:18:16,410
Oh, I have something else.

1549
01:18:18,076 --> 01:18:20,534
No, but... I assure you, it will be fine.

1550
01:18:21,078 --> 01:18:24,826
I'm checking because I'm not
sure about the safety standards.

1551
01:18:24,851 --> 01:18:28,434
Yes, but I tell you it's all good.
It's all good. Really.

1552
01:18:30,466 --> 01:18:31,465
Papi!

1553
01:18:31,525 --> 01:18:33,608
- What is it?
- Come see.

1554
01:18:36,954 --> 01:18:38,661
I'm sorry, but this won't be possible.

1555
01:18:38,693 --> 01:18:41,264
- Why?
- Not enough supervisors.

1556
01:18:41,289 --> 01:18:43,664
- If there's a glitch, I'm toast.
- No, sir!

1557
01:18:44,128 --> 01:18:45,211
Come on, remove those.

1558
01:18:45,567 --> 01:18:46,823
Oh, no!

1559
01:18:47,772 --> 01:18:50,647
No problem, we're
going to do something else.

1560
01:18:52,566 --> 01:18:53,600
That's not true.

1561
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:55,005
What is this thing?

1562
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:56,447
It's not cool, that.

1563
01:18:56,674 --> 01:18:57,424
This sucks.

1564
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,440
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait...

1565
01:18:59,989 --> 01:19:01,901
- Listen to me, sir.
- No.

1566
01:19:02,111 --> 01:19:04,861
OK. We remove the vests.
We remove the vests.

1567
01:19:04,886 --> 01:19:06,178
- Oh, no!
- Yes, yes.

1568
01:19:07,158 --> 01:19:08,157
Come see.

1569
01:19:08,866 --> 01:19:10,323
I think you didn't understand.

1570
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:11,902
Yes, yes, I
understood perfectly.

1571
01:19:11,927 --> 01:19:14,245
They are not fit to row.
That's all!

1572
01:19:14,651 --> 01:19:17,359
You didn't understand.
I am not a nice guy.

1573
01:19:17,494 --> 01:19:20,939
If you don't give up your gear,
tonight, I'll break all your limbs

1574
01:19:20,964 --> 01:19:23,048
and I burn your cabin.
Did you understand that?

1575
01:19:26,689 --> 01:19:27,898
Come on, come.

1576
01:19:31,862 --> 01:19:33,653
It's good, it's arranged.

1577
01:19:35,675 --> 01:19:36,758
Thank you!

1578
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:40,646
Thanks, old faggot!

1579
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:43,102
My friends are so nice,

1580
01:19:43,183 --> 01:19:44,891
and I like them a lot.

1581
01:19:45,153 --> 01:19:48,486
I'll call you back later.
Kisses, mommy dear!

1582
01:19:50,227 --> 01:19:53,226
It's a village party!

1583
01:19:55,637 --> 01:19:57,345
Sylvain! Sylvain!

1584
01:20:09,232 --> 01:20:10,231
Soso!

1585
01:20:13,268 --> 01:20:15,185
Bring out the lethal weapon!

1586
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:19,098
- We'll win!
- Come on, guys!

1587
01:20:31,127 --> 01:20:33,544
I am the master of the world!

1588
01:20:52,059 --> 01:20:53,642
Why don't you go?

1589
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:55,657
Why don't you go yourself?

1590
01:21:03,351 --> 01:21:05,268
It's cool, oh my.

1591
01:21:07,879 --> 01:21:11,045
We're still doing a beast of a job.
- Yeah, that's for sure.

1592
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,377
What would you have
done in San Francisco?

1593
01:21:13,424 --> 01:21:15,276
The streets are like that, like that.

1594
01:21:15,301 --> 01:21:17,843
You have a Soso in a wheelchair,
you let him go...

1595
01:21:19,258 --> 01:21:22,467
"You dropped me, bunch of idiots!"
- Stop, stop!

1596
01:21:22,492 --> 01:21:25,491
- Céline, Céline!
- Soso! It's a "disabled"!

1597
01:21:26,898 --> 01:21:29,022
I'm going to swim, you're annoying.

1598
01:21:29,081 --> 01:21:30,664
Be careful, I'm coming!

1599
01:21:30,689 --> 01:21:31,688
We go back!

1600
01:21:48,732 --> 01:21:49,815
Hi!

1601
01:21:50,703 --> 01:21:52,828
- Hi!
- Hi, goodbye!

1602
01:21:53,733 --> 01:21:54,577
Have a good trip!

1603
01:21:54,602 --> 01:21:56,767
- Gad, put that paddle down!
- What?

1604
01:21:57,758 --> 01:22:00,341
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, damn. Marie!

1605
01:22:00,728 --> 01:22:02,394
- Are you OK, Marie?
- Full in the face.

1606
01:22:02,419 --> 01:22:03,960
Are you OK, Marie?

1607
01:22:04,353 --> 01:22:05,249
We're going to play!

1608
01:22:05,274 --> 01:22:07,377
<i>- Gad, what did you do?</i>
- Damn...

1609
01:22:07,879 --> 01:22:09,507
- It's not my fault.
- It's not your fault?

1610
01:22:09,532 --> 01:22:10,949
- No.
- But be careful.

1611
01:22:10,974 --> 01:22:12,890
I fell asleep, stupidly.

1612
01:22:13,010 --> 01:22:14,594
I was there and...

1613
01:22:15,666 --> 01:22:16,665
I didn't...

1614
01:22:17,548 --> 01:22:20,236
<i>Ronaldo, whenever he scores a goal...</i>

1615
01:22:20,261 --> 01:22:21,562
<i>each time he has the ball,</i>

1616
01:22:21,587 --> 01:22:23,440
even with Benzema.

1617
01:22:23,465 --> 01:22:26,122
- Benzema, he...
- Even with Karim.

1618
01:22:26,219 --> 01:22:29,431
Yes, he was switching,
and when he was switching, bang!

1619
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:31,944
You took it right on the mouth, huh?

1620
01:22:31,969 --> 01:22:34,053
You're not in too much pain,
is it OK? No?

1621
01:22:34,297 --> 01:22:36,744
It's okay. It'll pass. Okay?

1622
01:22:36,956 --> 01:22:38,623
- The boat was good.
- Yeah.

1623
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:41,146
Afterwards, you calmed down.

1624
01:22:41,171 --> 01:22:42,528
She was cold.

1625
01:22:43,401 --> 01:22:44,775
She was frozen.

1626
01:22:45,005 --> 01:22:46,088
Frozen, yeah.

1627
01:22:48,057 --> 01:22:51,182
Each time when he manages,
and he makes his pass...

1628
01:22:52,784 --> 01:22:54,659
Damn! Paulo, the cops!

1629
01:22:54,684 --> 01:22:55,683
Let's get out!

1630
01:22:55,910 --> 01:22:58,577
He attacked me!
It's him over there!

1631
01:23:04,068 --> 01:23:06,429
Police, move over!
Let pass!

1632
01:23:06,454 --> 01:23:07,746
Oh, damn.

1633
01:23:15,099 --> 01:23:16,990
Get out! Come on, get out!

1634
01:23:18,365 --> 01:23:20,816
They are disabled, don't touch them!

1635
01:23:22,832 --> 01:23:23,999
Come on, quickly!

1636
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:26,751
We pull a box, we leave.
Come on!

1637
01:23:28,723 --> 01:23:30,173
What are you doing, Paulo?

1638
01:23:32,082 --> 01:23:33,873
- I stop.
- What?

1639
01:23:34,594 --> 01:23:36,511
I stop. I stop it all.

1640
01:23:37,076 --> 01:23:39,066
Come on, don't be an idiot. Shit!

1641
01:23:48,944 --> 01:23:50,694
Damn, Paulo...

1642
01:23:52,553 --> 01:23:54,345
- Don't move!
- On the ground!

1643
01:23:54,712 --> 01:23:57,397
- Give me your hands!
- Your hands, we told you!

1644
01:23:57,781 --> 01:23:59,239
Where's the other?

1645
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:09,023
And I'll finish today

1646
01:25:09,048 --> 01:25:11,826
in appealing, Madam Judge,
to your sense of justice.

1647
01:25:12,325 --> 01:25:16,367
Of this justice whose primary
function is to protect society

1648
01:25:16,768 --> 01:25:19,518
from individuals such as Paul Mounier.

1649
01:25:20,591 --> 01:25:21,545
Thank you.

1650
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:23,194
Thank you, Mr. Prosecutor.

1651
01:25:24,199 --> 01:25:27,824
Mr. Mounier, do you have
anything to add?

1652
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:35,895
No.

1653
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:37,882
Are you sure?

1654
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:48,000
- Hi, everyone.
- Hello.

1655
01:25:48,025 --> 01:25:50,524
- Good morning.
- Hi, everyone.

1656
01:25:51,031 --> 01:25:52,906
Please, we are in audience.

1657
01:25:53,674 --> 01:25:55,465
Evacue everyone.

1658
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:57,483
Someone parked in
the "disabled" spot.

1659
01:25:57,565 --> 01:25:59,106
A valid asshole!

1660
01:25:59,195 --> 01:26:01,864
<i>- Sorry, it's me, the big bitch.</i>
- Exactly, there's som...

1661
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:03,957
Pardon, c'est moi qui me suis garée.

1662
01:26:03,982 --> 01:26:06,537
I completely forgot to put the label on.

1663
01:26:06,562 --> 01:26:08,925
Oh, no, no, these things happen. It's...

1664
01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:10,741
But I should have put it.

1665
01:26:10,995 --> 01:26:14,369
I prefer to say it.
People often think that...

1666
01:26:14,458 --> 01:26:16,360
They park while being able-bodied.

1667
01:26:16,536 --> 01:26:18,338
- Yeah.
- It's unbearable, I agree.

1668
01:26:18,363 --> 01:26:21,391
We are in the middle of an audience!
You can't come in like this.

1669
01:26:21,416 --> 01:26:25,375
Excuse us. I am the center manager
and I would like to add something to...

1670
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:29,899
Yes, but now is not the time, ma'am.
You are in a court of law, there are rules.

1671
01:26:29,924 --> 01:26:31,694
Did you find a place, anyway?

1672
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:33,594
Yeah, the street...

1673
01:26:33,619 --> 01:26:34,812
- A street.
- All right.

1674
01:26:34,837 --> 01:26:36,263
<i>Please calm down.</i>

1675
01:26:36,294 --> 01:26:39,578
Excuse me but since we're here,
we'll tell you anyway.

1676
01:26:39,603 --> 01:26:42,186
- Do you agree?
- Yes.

1677
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:45,939
Calm down, please!

1678
01:26:46,573 --> 01:26:49,031
- So, two minutes.
- Thank you.

1679
01:26:52,384 --> 01:26:54,592
Actually, we just wanted to say that...

1680
01:26:55,294 --> 01:26:57,643
what Paulo or Sylvain did...

1681
01:27:00,184 --> 01:27:01,642
<i>I don't know who you are, in fact.</i>

1682
01:27:02,925 --> 01:27:04,092
But never mind.

1683
01:27:06,689 --> 01:27:09,509
We all agree that it's not good.

1684
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:10,814
We all feel betrayed.

1685
01:27:12,953 --> 01:27:14,037
It's true, yeah.

1686
01:27:14,165 --> 01:27:15,164
Quite.

1687
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:18,928
Me first and we all agree that
he must be judged for that,

1688
01:27:18,953 --> 01:27:20,369
there is no problem.

1689
01:27:21,201 --> 01:27:22,826
But...

1690
01:27:23,023 --> 01:27:25,439
but I have been working with them for 7 years,
and I have never seen them like that,

1691
01:27:25,464 --> 01:27:26,974
they had a best summer of their life.

1692
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:29,284
<i>- Yes.
- Yes.</i>

1693
01:27:29,373 --> 01:27:30,790
- Completely.
- It's true.

1694
01:27:33,305 --> 01:27:34,516
Did you have fun?

1695
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,225
- Yes, a lot!
- A lot!

1696
01:27:38,968 --> 01:27:40,301
Too awesome.

1697
01:27:40,450 --> 01:27:41,611
We had a drink!

1698
01:27:41,635 --> 01:27:45,559
It was so good, with Sylvain!
So good!

1699
01:27:45,652 --> 01:27:47,434
Sylvain, he's not a son of a bitch!

1700
01:27:47,459 --> 01:27:49,897
- Yes, yes, so...
- Sylvain, he's a sweetheart.

1701
01:27:49,924 --> 01:27:53,340
I must admit that it
was one of the most beautiful

1702
01:27:53,365 --> 01:27:55,687
encounters of my existence.

1703
01:27:55,764 --> 01:27:58,474
Sylvain, you cook good food.

1704
01:27:58,499 --> 01:28:01,124
- We laugh with him.
- He is too nice.

1705
01:28:01,149 --> 01:28:06,529
With Sylvain, we both took a shower naked.

1706
01:28:09,745 --> 01:28:13,104
We don't want Sylvain
going to prison, right?

1707
01:28:13,736 --> 01:28:16,611
- Yes!
- Sylvain, Sylvain!

1708
01:28:16,818 --> 01:28:19,902
<i>Calm down, please.
Okay, calm down.</i>

1709
01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:27,016
Merry Christmas.

1710
01:28:27,606 --> 01:28:29,189
That's beautiful.

1711
01:28:29,376 --> 01:28:31,059
But open it. You'll see.

1712
01:28:31,164 --> 01:28:33,706
It's beautiful. It's pretty, too.

1713
01:28:33,842 --> 01:28:34,840
Yeah.

1714
01:28:34,913 --> 01:28:37,330
It is less pretty than the other.

1715
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:39,159
Me,

1716
01:28:39,906 --> 01:28:41,698
I find it too beautiful.

1717
01:28:42,421 --> 01:28:43,420
Thibaut!

1718
01:28:44,075 --> 01:28:47,200
You put this ball down and
join the others, please.

1719
01:28:47,716 --> 01:28:48,883
Thank you.

1720
01:28:53,659 --> 01:28:56,616
Eh, you lovers,

1721
01:28:56,823 --> 01:28:58,739
come on, let's go there too.

1722
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:01,191
You'll catch a cold. They are cute.

1723
01:29:01,216 --> 01:29:03,133
- Doesn't matter.
- It doesn't matter.

1724
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:10,796
You don't mind being a big bag of shit?

1725
01:29:10,821 --> 01:29:11,446
Pardon?

1726
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:13,765
Wash your ears,
if you don't mind, Boris.

1727
01:29:13,790 --> 01:29:15,915
You don't mind being a big bag of shit?

1728
01:29:16,048 --> 01:29:19,005
With your big shitty car!
Get lost! Get lost!

1729
01:29:19,287 --> 01:29:21,454
- I'll be 5 minutes.
- Scratch!

1730
01:29:21,975 --> 01:29:24,623
Get lost with your big asshole car!

1731
01:29:24,648 --> 01:29:26,482
Asshole! And shut up!

1732
01:29:26,688 --> 01:29:28,854
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

1733
01:29:29,042 --> 01:29:30,750
Son of a bitch!

1734
01:29:30,952 --> 01:29:33,535
Exactly! Shut up!

1735
01:29:35,321 --> 01:29:36,987
Merry Christmas anyway.

1736
01:29:42,151 --> 01:29:44,094
<i>- How are you doing?
- Fine, and you?</i>

1737
01:29:44,119 --> 01:29:46,311
<i>Well, if it's okay, listen...</i>

1738
01:29:46,336 --> 01:29:48,710
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

1739
01:29:55,305 --> 01:29:56,304
So?

1740
01:29:57,294 --> 01:29:59,738
- Yes?
- Did he like the gift?

1741
01:29:59,848 --> 01:30:01,598
- A lot.
- I think so.

1742
01:30:01,707 --> 01:30:06,385
And first, you have to talk to Alice.

1743
01:30:06,730 --> 01:30:10,748
Not so loud, I talked to her,
there is nothing urgent.

1744
01:30:10,901 --> 01:30:12,859
Yes, it's now, right away.

1745
01:30:12,942 --> 01:30:14,107
No, later.

1746
01:30:18,686 --> 01:30:20,886
- I'm here, I will always be here.
<i>- Marc. Marc.</i>

1747
01:30:21,009 --> 01:30:23,217
- The Papouilles, later.
- Oh my...

1748
01:30:23,446 --> 01:30:26,154
- Excuse me.
- No problem. Good morning.

1749
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:28,406
Goodbye, my darling.

1750
01:30:28,928 --> 01:30:30,636
Kisses, kisses!

1751
01:30:30,712 --> 01:30:32,420
Alexandre, a globe?

1752
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:35,213
What if we hang this on you, like this?

1753
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:38,235
- Oh, that's good.
- Everything suits me. Anything dresses me.

1754
01:30:38,378 --> 01:30:39,618
And this one?

1755
01:30:44,312 --> 01:30:45,311
Oh, Orpi!

1756
01:30:45,594 --> 01:30:47,469
- Orpi!
- Orpi!

1757
01:30:47,663 --> 01:30:48,788
Orpi!

1758
01:30:55,409 --> 01:30:57,826
- I'll give you 3 minutes.
- It's okay, it's good.

1759
01:30:58,948 --> 01:31:00,157
For you.

1760
01:31:00,771 --> 01:31:04,312
- For me, really?
- Yeah, you have to open it.

1761
01:31:10,566 --> 01:31:13,439
Oh, a jersey of my player!

1762
01:31:13,528 --> 01:31:15,028
Who is your player?

1763
01:31:15,608 --> 01:31:17,940
A jersey of Cristian Ronaldo.

1764
01:31:22,067 --> 01:31:24,025
And it's the real one of Real.

1765
01:31:24,683 --> 01:31:27,578
- Really of his team?
- Yeah.

1766
01:31:28,451 --> 01:31:29,741
Thank you!

1767
01:31:31,051 --> 01:31:32,759
Are you cuddling now?

1768
01:31:34,295 --> 01:31:36,421
It's the real one. It's cool, it's...

1769
01:31:38,357 --> 01:31:40,398
- Vraiment, merci.
- Thanks to you. And keep it.

1770
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:42,745
Normally it should fit you.
It's your size.

1771
01:31:55,179 --> 01:31:56,887
Sympas, tes bracelets.

1772
01:31:57,154 --> 01:31:58,957
Which jewelry store do they come from?

1773
01:32:02,601 --> 01:32:05,392
Surely the same as yours, right?

1774
01:32:12,274 --> 01:32:13,466
How did they get you?

1775
01:32:13,491 --> 01:32:16,283
It was complicated,
they had a hard time because...

1776
01:32:16,308 --> 01:32:20,573
They had to get up from the desk,
leave the computer, that I surrender.

1777
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,478
Three years max, a priori.

1778
01:32:26,609 --> 01:32:28,067
Are you going to make it?

1779
01:32:30,279 --> 01:32:31,362
And you?

1780
01:32:32,042 --> 01:32:33,209
Yeah.

1781
01:32:36,146 --> 01:32:39,562
I'm sorry for everyone blablablabla, there.

1782
01:32:42,516 --> 01:32:43,641
Dad.

1783
01:32:56,499 --> 01:32:58,067
Take care of yourself.

1784
01:33:01,063 --> 01:33:02,395
Merry Christmas!

1785
01:33:20,766 --> 01:33:22,271
No, really?

1786
01:33:22,794 --> 01:33:25,430
Can't be true! Look!

1787
01:33:26,002 --> 01:33:29,353
An anonymous donor
who bought the cottage!

1788
01:33:34,268 --> 01:33:35,684
The cottage is ours!
