1
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:51,050
<i>There is something
wrong with me.</i>

2
00:00:54,853 --> 00:00:56,286
<i>An emptiness.</i>

3
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,557
<i>I thought it started
when my sister died,</i>

4
00:01:03,692 --> 00:01:07,132
<i>but now it feels like
something bigger.</i>

5
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,028
<i>Just a... void.</i>

6
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,644
<i>Or maybe I'm just bored.</i>

7
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:42,464
Boo.

8
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,142
<i>They send me a job,</i>

9
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,842
<i>I clock in, clock out, you know?</i>

10
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:02,451
<i>I'm in the cleanup business.</i>

11
00:02:04,348 --> 00:02:07,324
<i>This week, Malaysia.
Next week, who knows?</i>

12
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:12,054
<i>I thought throwing myself
into work was the answer.</i>

13
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:17,165
<i>But I'm not focused,
and I'm not happy,</i>

14
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:18,867
<i>and I don't have purpose.</i>

15
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:23,674
<i>And without purpose, I'm
just drifting like a river...</i>

16
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,577
Or like an old leaf.

17
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:33,018
Or like an old leaf in a river.

18
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:35,011
Which do you think
is bet... 'Ey!

19
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,551
You weren't listening to me.

20
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:39,954
It's like your mind
is somewhere else.

21
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:43,625
Well, whatever. You're
useless to me unless

22
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,199
you can get me past that
facial recognition thingy.

23
00:02:58,106 --> 00:02:59,240
Hello.

24
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:01,609
Can you help me get in there?

25
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,880
No?

26
00:03:04,145 --> 00:03:05,315
Mmm.

27
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,551
You've got your own
problems, I guess.

28
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,722
Well, it didn't say how
to destroy the evidence

29
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,087
in the assignment.

30
00:03:12,222 --> 00:03:13,222
It's gonna get messy.

31
00:03:13,356 --> 00:03:15,194
Stop right there!

32
00:03:21,998 --> 00:03:23,225
Hi.

33
00:03:24,195 --> 00:03:26,628
Now, that's a face that
can open a scanner.

34
00:03:26,764 --> 00:03:28,130
Did Valentina send you?

35
00:03:28,265 --> 00:03:30,599
This research is
property of OXE Group.

36
00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:32,035
You're gonna tell me

37
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,762
-I don't understand.
-You don't understand.

38
00:03:33,845 --> 00:03:35,398
-We've made a breakthrough.
-You've made a breakthrough.

39
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,762
-It's gonna change the world.
-No, no, no.

40
00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:38,402
-It could end the world.
-Blah, blah, blah.

41
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,850
Valentina doesn't understand
what happened here.

42
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:42,587
Shh, shh, shh.

43
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,356
Look, blame the US government
for their pesky investigation.

44
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,159
Now we have to get
rid of all this stuff.

45
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,824
Do you think I
like taking orders?

46
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,988
Going from job to job doing
the same thing all the time?

47
00:03:53,124 --> 00:03:55,696
Don't do it. I
wouldn't do that.

48
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,536
Always a struggle for a gun.

49
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:02,674
Oh, God.

50
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,769
You shoot, I dodge.

51
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:09,380
Oh, my God.

52
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:12,977
Tell Valentina she's
making a mistake.

53
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:18,389
You guys can never aim for shit.

54
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,959
Always collateral damage.

55
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:28,463
You try to say your last words.

56
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:30,331
Project Sentry isn't
what she thinks.

57
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:32,394
But you start to fall asleep.

58
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,638
Oh...

59
00:04:39,978 --> 00:04:41,280
Oh, damn.

60
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,107
I needed that face.

61
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:47,076
Okay.

62
00:04:47,212 --> 00:04:49,387
The assignment is...
Oh, wait. Hang on.

63
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:56,295
Assignment is complete.

64
00:04:57,523 --> 00:04:58,726
What's next?

65
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:08,496
Representative Barnes,

66
00:05:08,632 --> 00:05:10,758
as a freshman congressman,
any words on today's hearing?

67
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:13,335
Well, I'm not on the
impeachment committee,

68
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:18,208
but the rumors of wrongdoing
are, um, very worrying.

69
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:22,844
They are, uh, very, very
concerning and worrying.

70
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,189
And, uh, I think that

71
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,182
my Brooklyn constituents
deserve better,

72
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:28,327
so we're-we're gonna get
to the bottom of this,

73
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:32,397
um... ...worrying issue.

74
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:33,789
Thank you.

75
00:05:37,264 --> 00:05:39,261
Now, today, the
committee is meeting

76
00:05:39,396 --> 00:05:41,869
to examine this official
who sits before you.

77
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:45,476
Articles of impeachment have
been brought against her.

78
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,546
And when we vote in
favor of the impeachment,

79
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,073
she will be removed from
her post permanently.

80
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,409
Please state your
name for the record.

81
00:05:54,012 --> 00:05:56,511
Valentina Allegra de Fontaine.

82
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,981
Mm-hmm.

83
00:05:58,117 --> 00:06:00,051
-Uh, Miss Fontaine...
-No.

84
00:06:00,186 --> 00:06:03,258
It's "de Fontaine."
You forgot the "de."

85
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:05,387
Mr. Anderson, for example,

86
00:06:05,523 --> 00:06:09,901
is Secretary of Defense,
not secretary of "fense."

87
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:13,028
Miss de Fontaine.

88
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:15,031
At this moment, you are serving

89
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,808
as a director of
the CIA, correct?

90
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,368
That is correct.

91
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:20,227
And before that, you were
the chairwoman of the board

92
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,644
of OXE Group?

93
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:24,839
Yes. Although, I have
fully divested in OXE

94
00:06:24,975 --> 00:06:26,442
since taking office.

95
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:30,211
I now sit on the board in a
strategic guidance capacity.

96
00:06:30,347 --> 00:06:34,118
And following this
strategic guidance,

97
00:06:34,254 --> 00:06:36,527
the OXE Group maintains
significant holdings

98
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,429
in unregulated labs
in foreign countries

99
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,991
and rumored human
experimentation.

100
00:06:42,127 --> 00:06:44,534
All part of an illegal operation

101
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:49,331
to develop your own
super... person.

102
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:52,336
May I speak now, Congressman?

103
00:06:52,472 --> 00:06:53,905
Yes.

104
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,909
First of all, I don't have time

105
00:06:56,044 --> 00:06:59,044
to entertain these
rumors and this gossip.

106
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:02,211
Right now, there are
multiple rogue nations

107
00:07:02,347 --> 00:07:05,481
with technologies that
far exceed our own.

108
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:08,293
And you'll recall that our
last president turned into

109
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,329
a bright red superhuman monster

110
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,663
who nearly destroyed this city.

111
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:19,335
The Avengers are not
walking through that door.

112
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,935
We have no reliable heroes.

113
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:26,775
That is why the onus
is on me, on us,

114
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,380
the American government,
to shield its citizens.

115
00:07:30,515 --> 00:07:31,773
And you know...

116
00:07:31,908 --> 00:07:33,109
Madame Director.

117
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,435
...anything I have
done in my roles,

118
00:07:34,518 --> 00:07:36,486
both at OXE or at the CIA,

119
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,951
has been done with
that goal in mind.

120
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:41,659
Order. Madame Director.

121
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:45,088
I officially reject these
articles of impeachment.

122
00:07:45,224 --> 00:07:47,959
This is a partisan
waste of time.

123
00:07:48,095 --> 00:07:49,375
And your hunt will
come up empty,

124
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:52,161
no matter how many
nooks and crannies

125
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:54,038
you happen to
stick your nose in.

126
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,563
So you don't mind

127
00:07:55,698 --> 00:07:58,141
if this committee continues
this investigation?

128
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:00,303
Oh, of course not.

129
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,205
Shit.

130
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:05,309
We gotta get all of
this outta here ASAP.

131
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,452
Yep. So far they've removed
all the case studies...

132
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:09,612
Okay, just get rid
of any hanging chads

133
00:08:09,747 --> 00:08:12,649
that could get me impeached
or land me in federal prison.

134
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,086
Copy. No prison.

135
00:08:14,222 --> 00:08:16,493
What about our shadow
ops out in the field?

136
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,257
Did all those loose
ends get tied up?

137
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:21,360
Well, the ends are tied,
yes, but the rope is on fire.

138
00:08:21,495 --> 00:08:22,495
What?

139
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:24,735
Can you please
just say it normal?

140
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,865
Okay, um, one operative
blew up an entire laboratory

141
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:29,402
in the middle of Kuala Lumpur.

142
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:30,573
Whatever.

143
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:32,170
Did the new assignments
get sent out?

144
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:34,612
Yes, ma'am. All but
one have checked in.

145
00:08:36,314 --> 00:08:37,539
Where is she?

146
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,048
There's Brezhnev.

147
00:08:44,184 --> 00:08:45,617
Those guys with
the little waves.

148
00:08:45,752 --> 00:08:47,458
Get out of my way.

149
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,688
Get out of my...

150
00:08:49,824 --> 00:08:52,062
I click "leave on porch."

151
00:08:53,724 --> 00:08:57,831
Your "subordinance" will
be reported to DoorDash HQ.

152
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:00,099
Alexei, it's me. Open up.

153
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,367
Yelena?

154
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:08,173
Hold on!

155
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,796
"Protecting you from
boring evening."

156
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,227
Hmm.

157
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:30,668
Yelena! So good to see you.

158
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,104
Hi, Dad.

159
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,106
Sorry for the wait.

160
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,801
I was on important call.

161
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:39,404
Highly classified.

162
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,109
How long has it
been, huh? A year?

163
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:47,311
Wow, yeah, I guess...
I guess it has been.

164
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:50,846
You... You've been
busy with work?

165
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:52,281
Oh, yeah.

166
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:56,086
Yeah, a lot of,
uh... a lot of work.

167
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,887
-Me too.
-Too many irons in fire.

168
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:01,127
Uh, security.

169
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:03,129
My limo business.

170
00:10:03,264 --> 00:10:04,994
You would not believe
the important people

171
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,671
I meet driving.

172
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,865
So you... you feel fulfilled?

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,242
Oh, yeah.

174
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:13,677
Yeah, so full, so filled.

175
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,844
Move to DC, best
decision I ever made.

176
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,440
Isn't this
technically Baltimore?

177
00:10:18,575 --> 00:10:20,980
No. Baltimore start
next block over.

178
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:22,883
-Oh.
-But why do you ask this?

179
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:25,723
What, uh... What
brings you here?

180
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:31,496
Uh, I... I wanted to talk
to you about Valentina.

181
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,393
Okay. New assignment.

182
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:37,601
You come to Red Guardian.
You want a little help.

183
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:41,434
Uh, no, I... I think
I'm gonna quit.

184
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:42,773
What?

185
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,568
I would burn the city to
the ground to work for her.

186
00:10:46,703 --> 00:10:49,103
What? You just said
you were fulfilled.

187
00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:50,239
Lena, I was lying.

188
00:10:50,374 --> 00:10:51,248
Look around you.
I'm miserable.

189
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,613
Give me her number.

190
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:54,015
-No way.
-Give to me.

191
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,413
-Alexei, stop, stop.
-I call her. I use...

192
00:10:57,552 --> 00:10:58,684
Lena!

193
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,824
Lena, what is wrong?

194
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,956
The light inside you is dim

195
00:11:03,092 --> 00:11:05,158
even by Eastern
European standards.

196
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,926
I've just been
wondering, you know,

197
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:12,495
like, what... is the point?

198
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:15,299
In any of this?

199
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:18,569
The point of work
is fame and fortune.

200
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:21,642
Fortune buys friends, and love,

201
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:24,109
and a lot of cool clothes.

202
00:11:24,245 --> 00:11:25,707
-Okay. Thank you.
-Okay, okay...

203
00:11:25,842 --> 00:11:27,430
-No, never mind. It's fine.
-No, no, no. Okay.

204
00:11:27,513 --> 00:11:30,044
You-You want to know
when I was really happy?

205
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:32,053
Yes, please.

206
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:38,290
When I was serving
my country as a hero.

207
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:41,696
Saving civilians in streets.

208
00:11:41,832 --> 00:11:43,894
Being cheered on by the crowd.

209
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:46,529
Adored like a god.

210
00:11:50,268 --> 00:11:52,502
There is no higher calling.

211
00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:57,344
Your sister understood
something about that.

212
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,674
Mm-mmm.

213
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:02,248
Perhaps it is time that
you followed in her path.

214
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,649
Why do you have this photo out?

215
00:12:13,057 --> 00:12:15,063
We were so bad.

216
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:17,428
You were happy.

217
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,629
I'll make you something.

218
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:26,534
You know, I'm still super
soldier in his prime.

219
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:28,270
Maybe you could
put in a good word

220
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:31,642
with Valentina for me, huh?

221
00:12:31,778 --> 00:12:36,711
Okay, Val. Reporting for duty.
What's my next assignment?

222
00:12:36,846 --> 00:12:39,515
Thank you, Ms. Belova.
I was starting to worry.

223
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:42,690
After this though,
I... I need a change.

224
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,125
<i>Oh, really?</i>

225
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,430
Yeah, maybe something
more public facing.

226
00:12:48,565 --> 00:12:49,424
Interesting.

227
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,763
Yelena's ready for her close-up?

228
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:56,002
Yeah, this just isn't
working for me anymore.

229
00:12:56,137 --> 00:12:57,369
<i>Okay, well,</i>

230
00:12:57,504 --> 00:12:59,304
<i>you know I love promoting women.</i>

231
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,709
You complete this last
assignment for OXE,

232
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:04,112
and you have a deal.

233
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,312
<i>Okay?</i>

234
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,150
Okay.

235
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,715
<i>There's a warehouse facility,</i>

236
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:16,522
<i>a vault, built a mile
down into a mountain.</i>

237
00:13:16,658 --> 00:13:21,228
<i>It stores all of OXE Group's
most sensitive assets.</i>

238
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:23,430
<i>Intel's come in that
a rogue operative</i>

239
00:13:23,565 --> 00:13:25,693
<i>with attributes perfectly
tailored to rob me</i>

240
00:13:25,828 --> 00:13:30,973
<i>is intending to...
well, rob me.</i>

241
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:33,208
I need you to follow
the target inside

242
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:36,738
<i>and find out what
she intends to steal.</i>

243
00:13:36,873 --> 00:13:39,209
<i>I'll add your biometrics
to the system.</i>

244
00:13:39,344 --> 00:13:40,848
<i>You'll have full access.</i>

245
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,955
<i>Once you assess
what's being stolen,</i>

246
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:48,123
<i>you have the go-ahead
to terminate on sight.</i>

247
00:13:49,387 --> 00:13:50,986
<i>And then, no problem.</i>

248
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,202
<i>You know, we can find you
some "good guy" material.</i>

249
00:13:57,864 --> 00:14:00,597
<i>It's simple, really. It's
just one little target...</i>

250
00:14:01,332 --> 00:14:02,533
<i>and you're done.</i>

251
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:21,447
What is happening?

252
00:15:28,123 --> 00:15:29,690
You're not even my target.

253
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:31,160
You're mine.

254
00:15:56,315 --> 00:15:57,714
I'm not here for you.

255
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:17,602
There you are.

256
00:16:18,038 --> 00:16:19,139
Now what?

257
00:16:19,274 --> 00:16:21,309
<i>Oh, get over yourself.</i>

258
00:16:38,128 --> 00:16:40,064
<i>Stay out of my way.</i>

259
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:03,378
Is she actually dead? Oh...

260
00:18:12,453 --> 00:18:15,555
Whoa. No. Hi. Hey.

261
00:18:16,852 --> 00:18:18,723
I'm... I'm Bob.

262
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:29,436
Yes, these are the
Chitauri handcuffs.

263
00:18:29,571 --> 00:18:31,301
Recovered from the
Battle of New York

264
00:18:31,437 --> 00:18:32,801
by the first responders.

265
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:34,310
They came with the new property.

266
00:18:34,445 --> 00:18:36,911
Just reminds us that,
of course, we struggle,

267
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:38,279
but then we get back up.

268
00:18:38,414 --> 00:18:40,314
-Yes, we do.
-I love it. Yeah.

269
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:42,451
-That's inspiring.
-Oh.

270
00:18:42,987 --> 00:18:44,184
Thank you, Congressman.

271
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,157
I'm so happy that you're here.

272
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,293
Yes, this is a beautiful
fake event, Val.

273
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,653
"The First Responders
Family Fund."

274
00:18:51,788 --> 00:18:53,498
-Yes.
-That's cute.

275
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,859
Cute? Oh.

276
00:18:54,995 --> 00:18:56,955
This won't sway the votes
enough to save your ass.

277
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:59,326
Oh.

278
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:01,937
Okay. So, can you
go get him, Mel?

279
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:03,539
-Yep.
-Thank you.

280
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:07,201
This gaudy Avenger propaganda
reeks of desperation.

281
00:19:07,337 --> 00:19:10,075
If you really thought
that, you wouldn't be here.

282
00:19:10,211 --> 00:19:11,679
You're scared

283
00:19:11,815 --> 00:19:14,446
because your investigation
of my office came up clean.

284
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:16,452
-Hmm. Squeaky clean.
-Mm-hmm.

285
00:19:16,587 --> 00:19:19,151
Almost like someone had
frantically gotten rid

286
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:20,486
of all the evidence.

287
00:19:20,622 --> 00:19:22,824
Or like someone was
incredibly innocent.

288
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,394
Without proof,

289
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,820
this impeachment thing is
running on borrowed time.

290
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:28,112
Uh, excuse me.

291
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:29,431
Turn around.

292
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:31,331
Oh.

293
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:32,797
-How great.
-Oh, thank you.

294
00:19:32,932 --> 00:19:34,901
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you very much.

295
00:19:35,036 --> 00:19:36,306
Ah...

296
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,446
What do you think?

297
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:43,643
Oh.

298
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:45,573
-Hi.
-Mel, right?

299
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:47,251
-Mm-hmm.
-Mmm.

300
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:50,045
This must all seem like
ancient history to you.

301
00:19:51,353 --> 00:19:52,948
You know, Kierkegaard says

302
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:55,688
that life can only be
understood backwards.

303
00:19:56,853 --> 00:19:58,586
-Very true.
-Is it?

304
00:19:58,722 --> 00:20:00,259
I don't know, actually.

305
00:20:00,395 --> 00:20:01,661
It did sound good, though.

306
00:20:01,796 --> 00:20:03,825
He did believe that it
was up to individuals

307
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,127
-to create values.
-Hmm.

308
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:12,500
I know who you are
and what you're doing.

309
00:20:12,635 --> 00:20:13,810
What am I doing?

310
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:15,178
You're working me.

311
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,446
You're trying to
get me on your side.

312
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,313
Okay, look. I...

313
00:20:20,448 --> 00:20:22,182
Y-You say you know who I am.

314
00:20:22,317 --> 00:20:23,784
So you know my story,

315
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,115
and you know I didn't have
a choice who I worked for.

316
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,227
But you do.

317
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:33,026
I need to keep
Valentina on schedule.

318
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:34,459
Oh.

319
00:20:34,595 --> 00:20:36,792
What is this? This your trash?

320
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:39,134
-It's my business card.
-Oh.

321
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,900
In case you need some help or,

322
00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:43,738
you know, you wanna share
some secret hidden evidence.

323
00:20:43,874 --> 00:20:44,939
Ah.

324
00:20:45,075 --> 00:20:46,706
Okay. Goodbye.

325
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:52,381
Who are you?

326
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:54,649
I'm... I'm Bob. I
told you. I'm, uh...

327
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:56,516
Yeah. Bob.

328
00:20:56,652 --> 00:20:58,045
Jesus Christ.
Stop saying "Bob."

329
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,713
-Who sent you, Bob?
-Nobody.

330
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:01,554
Why would I be sent?

331
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,184
Were you all...
You were all sent?

332
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:05,108
Okay, I'm not sure
what's happening here,

333
00:21:05,191 --> 00:21:06,713
but you're all exhausting
and my job is done, so...

334
00:21:06,796 --> 00:21:09,532
Ah, but you see my job
is to keep an eye on you.

335
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:11,532
So, no, you are not gonna
go anywhere anymore.

336
00:21:11,668 --> 00:21:13,762
So you're keeping
an eye on her, huh?

337
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,063
That's a halfway decent cover

338
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:16,866
for somebody stealing
assets from OXE.

339
00:21:17,001 --> 00:21:19,541
I'm not stealing.
She's stealing.

340
00:21:27,082 --> 00:21:28,114
Okay.

341
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,947
It's clear we have all
worked for Valentina

342
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:34,351
in some sort of
shadow ops capacity.

343
00:21:34,486 --> 00:21:35,886
Yeah. So?

344
00:21:36,022 --> 00:21:37,827
So all of this stuff
is OXE's secrets.

345
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,397
But so are we.

346
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,964
Which makes us liabilities
that no one would miss.

347
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,401
Oh, speak for yourself.

348
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:45,902
We are the evidence, and
this is the shredder.

349
00:21:46,037 --> 00:21:47,564
She wants us gone.

350
00:21:47,699 --> 00:21:48,938
Your theory's flawed.

351
00:21:49,073 --> 00:21:50,766
Oh, please. Go on.

352
00:21:50,902 --> 00:21:53,140
Okay. Well, look at the facts.

353
00:21:53,276 --> 00:21:54,740
The infamous Ghost.

354
00:21:54,876 --> 00:21:57,346
A SHIELD reject on the
run from 15 nations?

355
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,565
'Cause the dead one over there,

356
00:21:58,648 --> 00:21:59,942
she destroyed half of Budapest.

357
00:22:00,077 --> 00:22:02,043
Don't talk about her like that.

358
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:03,583
And you, former
Red Room assassin.

359
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:05,855
God only knows the
blood on your hands.

360
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,214
Pretty ludicrous

361
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,608
coming from the dime-store
Captain America.

362
00:22:08,691 --> 00:22:10,085
I'll have you know
I was actually

363
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,447
the official Captain
America, so...

364
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,155
Yeah, for, like, two seconds.

365
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,740
Before you publicly
murdered an innocent man

366
00:22:14,823 --> 00:22:16,258
on the streets.

367
00:22:16,393 --> 00:22:17,883
-Do I have that right?
-Really? Define "innocent."

368
00:22:17,966 --> 00:22:20,567
Hey, look. I'm a decorated
combat veteran, okay?

369
00:22:20,702 --> 00:22:22,497
I have a loving wife and a son.

370
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:25,267
Let's be honest, you guys are
just cheap mercenaries. Okay?

371
00:22:25,402 --> 00:22:27,569
So, I... Clearly, I'm
supposed to bring you in.

372
00:22:28,943 --> 00:22:31,012
That was funny. Thank
you. We needed that.

373
00:22:33,409 --> 00:22:36,754
It was getting so tense
in here for a second.

374
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:41,952
I'm not leaving here without
completing my mission.

375
00:22:42,088 --> 00:22:44,292
Valentina gave me a
clean slate guarantee,

376
00:22:44,428 --> 00:22:45,993
and I'm not screwing that up.

377
00:22:46,128 --> 00:22:49,730
But this weirdo wasn't part
of the job, so I gotta know...

378
00:22:52,202 --> 00:22:53,395
How'd you get in?

379
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:56,539
I don't... I don't remember.

380
00:22:59,538 --> 00:23:00,442
Terrific answer.

381
00:23:00,577 --> 00:23:02,805
All right, um...
Tie yourselves up.

382
00:23:02,941 --> 00:23:05,112
-Wow. No.
-Oh, my God.

383
00:23:05,247 --> 00:23:06,747
And goodbye.

384
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,098
You guys hear that?

385
00:23:31,573 --> 00:23:33,904
Isn't that amazing? Cheers.

386
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,870
And she said,
"Not on my watch."

387
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,810
-Congressman Gary.
-Hey!

388
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:45,186
I have a plan.

389
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:46,721
Holy shit, Bucky.

390
00:23:48,118 --> 00:23:50,060
The assistant, she's ductile.

391
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:52,863
-Ductile? Oh.
-Yeah.

392
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,256
I-I mean, good.

393
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,645
But next time, why
don't you just text me

394
00:23:55,728 --> 00:23:57,161
like a normal person?

395
00:23:57,297 --> 00:23:58,847
Look, we're safe here.
We're in a blind spot, okay?

396
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,102
Away from those two cameras.

397
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,670
Just hold on, all right?

398
00:24:01,805 --> 00:24:04,635
We don't need to go
rogue in the darkness,

399
00:24:04,771 --> 00:24:06,169
or whatever you people do.

400
00:24:06,304 --> 00:24:07,822
Hold on? You don't know
what Val is capable of.

401
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:08,972
We need to move fast,

402
00:24:09,108 --> 00:24:10,740
and the assistant
is on the fence.

403
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,442
Without a smoking gun,

404
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:15,349
the best chance to get Val out
of power is to whip the votes.

405
00:24:15,485 --> 00:24:16,683
And you can help with that

406
00:24:16,819 --> 00:24:18,480
and then let the
system do its job.

407
00:24:18,615 --> 00:24:21,084
The system that goes on
recess every day at 4:00 p.m.

408
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:23,427
We are in a good
spot, I assure you.

409
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:26,096
My team is putting
together a juicy packet

410
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,421
for the next hearing.

411
00:24:28,157 --> 00:24:30,525
-Packet?
-Yes, Bucky.

412
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,470
Read the packets.

413
00:24:37,702 --> 00:24:38,939
Is it time?

414
00:24:39,074 --> 00:24:41,810
I can confirm all your
"guests" are in attendance,

415
00:24:41,945 --> 00:24:44,981
and vault level five has
been completely sealed off.

416
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:46,344
All right, then.

417
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,449
"All right, then. Move on
to the final step"? Or...

418
00:24:51,585 --> 00:24:52,821
Torch it all.

419
00:24:53,223 --> 00:24:54,591
Right. Um...

420
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,726
-Are you... Are you sure?
-Oh, my God.

421
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,091
Hey.

422
00:25:00,226 --> 00:25:02,823
Job or not, can you have
some respect, please?

423
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:04,425
Yeah, Jesus.

424
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,460
Hold on a second.

425
00:25:07,563 --> 00:25:09,530
What? She'd want
me to have it.

426
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:10,831
I need it.

427
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,270
What the hell is that?

428
00:25:16,405 --> 00:25:18,241
That doesn't sound
like a shredder.

429
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,518
It's an incinerator.

430
00:25:21,713 --> 00:25:22,947
Two minutes.

431
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,853
Then Valentina's
slate is wiped clean.

432
00:25:24,988 --> 00:25:27,117
You don't know that for
sure. Could be for anything.

433
00:25:27,253 --> 00:25:28,837
Could be for when they
come to pick me up.

434
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,086
Do you feel that?

435
00:25:30,222 --> 00:25:32,227
The temperature
rising dramatically

436
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:34,092
as if heat was involved?

437
00:25:36,027 --> 00:25:37,190
Okay, it's an incinerator.

438
00:25:37,326 --> 00:25:39,295
Oh, boy. That is no way to go.

439
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,013
Well, how would you
like to die today, Bob?

440
00:25:41,096 --> 00:25:42,263
Okay, ghost lady.

441
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:43,691
-Ava.
-Sure. Whatever. Don't care.

442
00:25:43,774 --> 00:25:45,152
We need to get you
through the walls,

443
00:25:45,235 --> 00:25:46,419
so that you can open the door.

444
00:25:46,502 --> 00:25:48,602
-She tried that already.
-I know she did.

445
00:25:48,738 --> 00:25:50,423
But we haven't tried shutting
down the sound barrier.

446
00:25:50,506 --> 00:25:54,046
Well, if they built
it just for her,

447
00:25:54,181 --> 00:25:56,554
there's gotta be an
independent power source.

448
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,150
Come on. Let's go.

449
00:26:02,255 --> 00:26:03,680
What... What exactly
are we looking for?

450
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:06,355
We're looking for
not-stupid questions, Bob.

451
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:21,238
I think I found it.

452
00:26:22,146 --> 00:26:23,405
Move!

453
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,512
I can override this.

454
00:26:27,648 --> 00:26:28,685
On your left!

455
00:26:30,685 --> 00:26:31,615
Or that works, I hope.

456
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,316
Go, go, go.

457
00:26:47,901 --> 00:26:49,365
You think she's coming back?

458
00:26:50,302 --> 00:26:52,566
I should have seen this coming.

459
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,003
<font color="#ffff54">Yelena!</font>

460
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:27,375
<font color="#ffff54">Yelena!</font>

461
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,178
<font color="#ffff54">Yelena, c'mon!</font>

462
00:27:37,551 --> 00:27:38,579
What?

463
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:41,450
<font color="#ffff54">Lunch will be over soon.</font>

464
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:44,458
<font color="#ffff54">Why'd you bring us so far out?</font>

465
00:27:44,658 --> 00:27:46,356
<font color="#ffff54">Anya, over here!</font>

466
00:27:48,463 --> 00:27:49,463
No.

467
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,433
<font color="#ffff54">I'm sorry.</font>

468
00:28:08,781 --> 00:28:11,301
<font color="#ffff54">Well done, Yelena. Your
first test is now complete.</font>

469
00:28:39,141 --> 00:28:40,377
You okay?

470
00:28:41,847 --> 00:28:43,512
Yeah, I'm fine.

471
00:28:47,024 --> 00:28:49,454
Hey. Didn't think you'd
come back. Thanks.

472
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:52,422
I had to. Someone cut the
power to the elevator.

473
00:28:54,928 --> 00:28:56,028
Lovely evening.

474
00:28:56,163 --> 00:28:57,658
Nice to be in the
room, you know?

475
00:28:59,229 --> 00:29:00,296
Okay. What is it, Mel?

476
00:29:00,432 --> 00:29:02,371
Just spit it out
already. What?

477
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:05,270
Um, it's your "guests."

478
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:08,809
They've somehow evaded
the "housewarming gift."

479
00:29:08,944 --> 00:29:10,137
-Oh, come on.
-And, um...

480
00:29:10,273 --> 00:29:11,706
God, is it possible

481
00:29:11,841 --> 00:29:14,875
that they've maybe, um,
joined forces against you?

482
00:29:16,448 --> 00:29:20,085
Mel. These are
defective losers.

483
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:23,183
Antisocial tragedy
in human form.

484
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,586
You know, honestly,

485
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,321
I cannot think of a
worse group of people

486
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:27,828
trying to work together.

487
00:29:27,963 --> 00:29:29,927
-My god.
-Right.

488
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:31,195
It's just that, um...

489
00:29:31,331 --> 00:29:34,695
-What?
-They're working together.

490
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,666
What...

491
00:29:41,173 --> 00:29:42,604
Who the hell is this guy?

492
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:44,271
I have no idea.

493
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,945
I need an ID on John Doe.

494
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:48,709
I wanna know how this man-boy

495
00:29:48,844 --> 00:29:52,015
got into my supposedly
impenetrable stronghold.

496
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,513
-Copy.
-And call Holt.

497
00:29:53,648 --> 00:29:55,451
Give him the vault coordinates.

498
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:57,517
I want the full
strike team mobilized.

499
00:29:57,653 --> 00:29:59,622
-We need to end this now.
-Okay.

500
00:30:00,024 --> 00:30:01,327
Calling now.

501
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,725
Holt? It's Mel. Ready
for coordinates?

502
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:16,640
I was trying to help...

503
00:30:16,776 --> 00:30:19,242
Everybody's got a reason for
being here except this guy.

504
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:20,676
Hey, Bobby.

505
00:30:20,811 --> 00:30:22,945
Less talking to yourself,
more talking to us.

506
00:30:25,518 --> 00:30:27,158
-I'm tired of this bullshit.
-Hey, Walker.

507
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,110
You tell me how you got
in here right goddamn now.

508
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:31,918
I swear, man, I-I just
woke up in this place.

509
00:30:32,054 --> 00:30:34,459
One minute, I was, you
know, getting my blood drawn

510
00:30:34,594 --> 00:30:36,561
for this medical study,
and the next I'm in here.

511
00:30:36,697 --> 00:30:39,033
In my pajamas. I don't
know what's happening.

512
00:30:39,168 --> 00:30:40,732
Okay, then show me
where you woke up.

513
00:30:40,868 --> 00:30:42,500
In... In there.

514
00:30:42,635 --> 00:30:45,671
Where everything's on fire.
That's real convenient.

515
00:30:45,807 --> 00:30:46,741
Walker, relax.

516
00:30:46,876 --> 00:30:48,268
You don't remember anything?

517
00:30:48,404 --> 00:30:49,470
Bag over your head?

518
00:30:49,605 --> 00:30:51,374
-A needle in your neck?
-No.

519
00:30:51,509 --> 00:30:54,049
-Choke hold? Nerve pinch?
-No.

520
00:30:54,984 --> 00:30:56,512
I think he's just a civilian.

521
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:58,247
If he's a civilian,
he knows too much.

522
00:30:58,382 --> 00:30:59,814
If he's an agent, he sucks.

523
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:01,673
Either way I say we throw
him back into the fire.

524
00:31:05,922 --> 00:31:09,295
Sorry. Look... You said
you were Captain America?

525
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:12,034
Why are you laughing?

526
00:31:12,969 --> 00:31:15,499
Just 'cause you're an asshole.

527
00:31:15,935 --> 00:31:17,270
You know?

528
00:31:21,944 --> 00:31:24,409
It's just funny. I mean...

529
00:31:26,743 --> 00:31:28,880
Hey. Whoa. Okay. Okay!

530
00:31:29,015 --> 00:31:30,552
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

531
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,686
We swung our tiny dicks.

532
00:31:32,822 --> 00:31:34,149
It was a lot of fun.

533
00:31:34,284 --> 00:31:35,656
You go over there.

534
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:37,620
Bob, come with me.

535
00:31:39,662 --> 00:31:41,325
Come here.

536
00:31:41,461 --> 00:31:44,330
-Are you hurt?
-No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

537
00:31:45,762 --> 00:31:47,300
You do not seem fine.

538
00:31:47,435 --> 00:31:50,039
Yeah, well, we've only
just met. This is...

539
00:31:50,674 --> 00:31:51,933
This is how I am.

540
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:53,306
Oh.

541
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,839
The talking to yourself?

542
00:31:55,974 --> 00:31:57,276
Yeah.

543
00:31:57,411 --> 00:31:58,851
-The emo aggressive thing?
-I mean...

544
00:31:58,943 --> 00:32:02,045
That... That guy's been a
dick to me from the start.

545
00:32:02,181 --> 00:32:03,615
Oh, I get it. He sucks.

546
00:32:03,751 --> 00:32:07,852
But we have to work together
to get out of here, so...

547
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:11,554
Well, you guys should just go
without me. It'll be easier.

548
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,456
Oh, no, you'll die down here.

549
00:32:13,592 --> 00:32:15,923
Yeah. Well,
whatever. I mean...

550
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:19,629
I think everyone's better
off if I just stay put.

551
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,874
Okay, I-I... I understand.

552
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,240
We all feel like shit sometimes.

553
00:32:27,376 --> 00:32:30,275
And loneliness, I
get that. I get it.

554
00:32:30,411 --> 00:32:32,948
And that... that
darkness gets...

555
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,777
...pretty enticing.

556
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:38,582
And then it starts to feel
a little bit like a...

557
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:42,751
A void.

558
00:32:45,926 --> 00:32:48,196
Yep. A void.

559
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,564
What do you do about it?

560
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,370
You shove it way
down. You just...

561
00:33:00,505 --> 00:33:03,179
push it down.

562
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:06,582
That's great... That's
really good advice.

563
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,878
You're welcome.

564
00:33:12,222 --> 00:33:13,401
You guys done with therapy yet?

565
00:33:13,484 --> 00:33:15,289
I think I found a way out.

566
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:20,591
Look, we're all alone.

567
00:33:21,093 --> 00:33:22,588
All of us.

568
00:33:22,724 --> 00:33:23,998
Let's just stick together

569
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:25,179
until we make it to the surface,

570
00:33:25,262 --> 00:33:26,597
and after that,

571
00:33:26,733 --> 00:33:28,320
you can start a fight
with a super soldier.

572
00:33:28,403 --> 00:33:29,966
Get yourself killed.
I don't care.

573
00:33:30,101 --> 00:33:31,272
Okay?

574
00:33:32,775 --> 00:33:35,309
Okay. Yeah.

575
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:43,482
"If the resolution of
impeachment is adopted..."

576
00:33:44,721 --> 00:33:46,155
Stupid packets.

577
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,157
Oh, God. Boring.

578
00:33:58,998 --> 00:33:59,900
Hello?

579
00:34:00,036 --> 00:34:02,435
<i>Hi. This is, uh, Mel.</i>

580
00:34:03,002 --> 00:34:05,273
Mel. Hi.

581
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:07,740
-You called.
<i>-I did.</i>

582
00:34:07,876 --> 00:34:13,083
I know that you're new to DC,
and I wanted to, um, network.

583
00:34:14,777 --> 00:34:16,079
-Network?
-<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

584
00:34:17,885 --> 00:34:19,741
<i>So, uh, how are you
feeling about your new job?</i>

585
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,785
Oh, it's great. Love it.

586
00:34:22,921 --> 00:34:25,227
<i>It's not ancient
history, you know.</i>

587
00:34:26,396 --> 00:34:28,692
I was in high school
when the aliens came.

588
00:34:29,261 --> 00:34:31,465
And the Avengers.

589
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:33,470
High school, huh?

590
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:34,867
I was, like, 90.

591
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:39,742
It's kinda strange that
it's all over now, right?

592
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,672
I mean, Avengers are gone.

593
00:34:42,808 --> 00:34:45,381
No one else is coming
to save the day.

594
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:48,347
<i>Maybe we could be the
people that are coming.</i>

595
00:34:48,483 --> 00:34:50,883
Just come in and
testify against her.

596
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:54,052
You must really
not know my boss.

597
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:55,188
We can protect you.

598
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,588
<i>Oh, can you?</i>

599
00:34:56,723 --> 00:34:58,786
Is that coming from the
freshman congressman

600
00:34:58,922 --> 00:35:00,111
who hasn't gotten a bill passed

601
00:35:00,194 --> 00:35:01,723
or the Winter Soldier?

602
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:04,600
Come on, Mel. Just
give me something.

603
00:35:06,503 --> 00:35:08,355
Hey... You can track
my phone, right?

604
00:35:08,438 --> 00:35:11,240
Yes, I can, but I
don't do that anymore.

605
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:14,342
Thank you, Congressman.
Have a great night.

606
00:35:26,922 --> 00:35:28,125
So,

607
00:35:29,188 --> 00:35:31,326
none of us fly?

608
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,787
What, do we all just
punch and shoot?

609
00:35:34,923 --> 00:35:38,234
Okay. Don't worry. I got this.

610
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:50,575
You should try that again.

611
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,549
We're pretty far down here.

612
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,711
Hey. Okay, why
don't you walk up

613
00:35:57,847 --> 00:35:59,045
through the walls or whatever

614
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,680
and then just throw
us a rope down?

615
00:36:00,816 --> 00:36:01,648
-Yeah.
-That's...

616
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,116
Okay, well, first of all,

617
00:36:03,252 --> 00:36:04,775
someone other than you
would have to ask me.

618
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:06,714
And second of all, I'd have
to know where I'm going

619
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,316
'cause I've never been able to
hold it longer than a minute.

620
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:09,909
So I'd just get lost
in an ocean of dirt,

621
00:36:09,992 --> 00:36:11,118
and then I'd be
crushed to death.

622
00:36:11,201 --> 00:36:12,432
-All right?
-Just a minute?

623
00:36:12,567 --> 00:36:15,568
-Oh, shut up.
-Oh, my God. We suck.

624
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,768
Uh...

625
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:20,034
I have an idea.

626
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:22,974
Right.

627
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:24,305
Left.

628
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,178
Right.

629
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:27,575
Ew. Which one of you is wet?

630
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,151
I... I run hot. Sorry.

631
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,010
Someone's got a
weird, hard butt.

632
00:36:31,146 --> 00:36:33,013
That's not my
butt. It's my suit.

633
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,520
Well, you need to
get a new suit.

634
00:36:35,656 --> 00:36:37,150
Pardon me for the
inconvenience.

635
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:39,620
I mean, I only spent
my entire life in labs

636
00:36:39,755 --> 00:36:40,889
hooked up to machines

637
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:42,598
so I could create
this physical cage

638
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,186
to keep my material body from
disintegrating at all times.

639
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,449
So, yeah, I'm so
sorry about that.

640
00:36:45,532 --> 00:36:47,034
You do not want to start

641
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,000
the whole sob story game.

642
00:36:49,135 --> 00:36:50,304
I win.

643
00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:52,537
Enslaved child
assassin over here.

644
00:36:52,673 --> 00:36:55,078
Well, you were just a kid, so...

645
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:56,803
Oh, so that's a good thing now?

646
00:36:56,939 --> 00:36:58,347
I just think it might be nice

647
00:36:58,482 --> 00:36:59,343
to know that you didn't
really know any better.

648
00:36:59,479 --> 00:37:01,475
Thanks. I feel way better.

649
00:37:01,611 --> 00:37:02,883
Hey, quit it.

650
00:37:10,057 --> 00:37:11,327
Uh...

651
00:37:12,555 --> 00:37:13,291
All right.

652
00:37:13,427 --> 00:37:16,189
-Okay. Okay.
-Ready?

653
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:19,302
Right. Oh, God.

654
00:37:21,703 --> 00:37:23,123
Oh, my God. Why
are you gasping?

655
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:25,236
Please don't gasp at work.

656
00:37:25,371 --> 00:37:27,073
It's the John Doe.

657
00:37:27,209 --> 00:37:28,974
He's Sentry Project.

658
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:33,514
No, everyone who went through
Sentry Project is dead, Mel.

659
00:37:33,649 --> 00:37:36,116
That's why we're in
this whole stupid mess.

660
00:37:36,251 --> 00:37:38,984
Yeah, but look. There.

661
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,589
Robert Reynolds entered the
pre-trial program in Malaysia,

662
00:37:42,724 --> 00:37:45,686
and he'd had a real
rough go before that.

663
00:37:45,822 --> 00:37:47,722
One of the test subjects.

664
00:37:47,857 --> 00:37:49,229
How did he get in my vault?

665
00:37:49,364 --> 00:37:51,533
He was supposed to be dead.

666
00:37:51,668 --> 00:37:54,095
You threw him out with
the rest of the evidence.

667
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:58,975
If he survived the
procedure, that means...

668
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:02,169
Yeah. It might actually work.

669
00:38:04,211 --> 00:38:05,579
Oh, my God.

670
00:38:09,653 --> 00:38:11,420
It's crazy. I can't
even see the floor.

671
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,288
Can we not talk about
how high up we are?

672
00:38:13,424 --> 00:38:14,820
I'm just not great with heights.

673
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:17,085
Hey, I think I see the door.

674
00:38:18,222 --> 00:38:20,454
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Okay. Okay.

675
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,728
Uh...

676
00:38:22,097 --> 00:38:23,564
Now what?

677
00:38:24,527 --> 00:38:25,694
Um...

678
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,734
I guess one of us should go...

679
00:38:29,939 --> 00:38:31,033
first.

680
00:38:32,136 --> 00:38:34,468
Then the other three
immediately fall.

681
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,674
Shit.

682
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,312
Sorry. Yeah, I
guess I didn't...

683
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,888
I didn't really
think this far ahead.

684
00:38:39,007 --> 00:38:40,617
Genius plan, Bobby.

685
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:43,078
-Always making things worse.
-These bloody boots.

686
00:38:43,213 --> 00:38:44,910
I don't think I can
hold this much longer.

687
00:38:45,046 --> 00:38:46,252
Okay. Hand me your baton.

688
00:38:46,388 --> 00:38:47,815
-I can reach it.
-What?

689
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,950
-Yeah.
-No way.

690
00:38:49,051 --> 00:38:49,923
You're just going to leave us.

691
00:38:50,058 --> 00:38:51,161
Okay.

692
00:38:51,296 --> 00:38:52,526
Spin us around...

693
00:38:52,662 --> 00:38:54,074
...and then I can...
I can latch us on.

694
00:38:54,157 --> 00:38:55,955
I'm not spinning
us around, okay?

695
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,119
Somebody's got to go first.

696
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:58,793
Cucumber, cucumber, cucumber.

697
00:38:58,928 --> 00:39:00,427
What the hell is happening?

698
00:39:00,563 --> 00:39:01,914
Growing up, somebody told me
that you can stop a sneeze

699
00:39:01,997 --> 00:39:03,129
if you confuse your brain.

700
00:39:03,265 --> 00:39:04,324
I always just
yelled "cucumber."

701
00:39:04,407 --> 00:39:05,805
-Okay.
-I have to sneeze.

702
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,662
But if I sneeze, then I'm
going to lose control.

703
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:09,330
This is insane, okay? I
can get us all out of here.

704
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:10,429
-I just need to go first.
-No.

705
00:39:10,512 --> 00:39:11,625
There's got to be another way.

706
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:13,581
Oh, no.

707
00:39:13,716 --> 00:39:15,717
-Cucumber! Cucumber!
-Cucumber! Cucumber!

708
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,612
All right! Come on! Okay,
just give me this. I got it!

709
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:34,894
You selfish prick.

710
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:36,731
Yet, you're all safe.

711
00:39:36,867 --> 00:39:38,331
I made a tactical decision

712
00:39:38,466 --> 00:39:41,235
to secure my own safety
and ensure all yours.

713
00:39:42,437 --> 00:39:44,706
Pretty ungrateful if
you ask me, but...

714
00:39:44,842 --> 00:39:46,075
You gonna make it, Bobby?

715
00:39:47,984 --> 00:39:51,245
Looks like you might have
missed arm, leg and chest day.

716
00:40:01,363 --> 00:40:03,631
-John?
-What?

717
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,029
Are you watching him?

718
00:40:07,165 --> 00:40:09,538
What? I'm doing it.
I'm watching him.

719
00:40:21,077 --> 00:40:22,550
-John.
-What, Olivia? What?

720
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,944
-Please.
-I'm watching him. He's fine.

721
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:26,382
You're in your phone.

722
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:29,149
Look, you don't like
the way that I do it,

723
00:40:29,285 --> 00:40:31,091
then you can do
it yourself, okay?

724
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,634
It's okay. It's okay.

725
00:40:43,833 --> 00:40:45,068
<i>Walker.</i>

726
00:40:46,768 --> 00:40:47,768
Uh...

727
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,369
What the hell are you doing?

728
00:40:58,616 --> 00:41:00,215
I'm fine.

729
00:41:03,187 --> 00:41:05,088
All right, let's
get out of here.

730
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,341
Okay, we need to
come up with a plan.

731
00:41:25,477 --> 00:41:27,033
-Here's what we're gonna do.
-You're the boss now? Cute.

732
00:41:27,116 --> 00:41:28,835
Yeah, it's our only chance
of getting out of here, so...

733
00:41:28,918 --> 00:41:31,013
Okay, I think I might
just surrender, probably.

734
00:41:31,149 --> 00:41:32,405
Okay, fine. Every
man for himself.

735
00:41:32,488 --> 00:41:33,754
Why should you be in charge?

736
00:41:33,889 --> 00:41:35,434
You almost killed all
of us right there.

737
00:41:35,517 --> 00:41:37,251
Well, let's see. I've
been in the trenches

738
00:41:37,387 --> 00:41:39,055
of every war-torn
country on this planet,

739
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,550
rescued God knows
how many hostages

740
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,624
and shook the hands
of two US presidents.

741
00:41:42,759 --> 00:41:44,328
What else? Uh...

742
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:46,383
Oh, high school state football
champs back-to-back-to-back.

743
00:41:46,466 --> 00:41:47,803
Go Bears.

744
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:50,772
Oh, wow. When I was five, I
was in a peewee soccer team

745
00:41:50,907 --> 00:41:52,658
called the West Chesapeake
Valley Thunderbolts

746
00:41:52,741 --> 00:41:54,571
sponsored by Shane's Tire Shop.

747
00:41:54,706 --> 00:41:55,642
We won zero games,

748
00:41:55,778 --> 00:41:56,924
and one time, this girl, Mindy,

749
00:41:57,007 --> 00:41:58,539
she did a poo at midfield.

750
00:41:58,675 --> 00:42:01,281
Anyone else have any pointless
childhood stories to tell?

751
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:03,244
Grew up in a lab prison.

752
00:42:03,379 --> 00:42:05,846
Meth-addicted
sign-twirling chicken.

753
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:08,048
It was a summer job.

754
00:42:08,184 --> 00:42:09,415
Right. Okay, here's the plan.

755
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:11,693
We set off an explosion
to bring them in.

756
00:42:11,828 --> 00:42:13,627
No. Too many variables
with an explosion.

757
00:42:13,763 --> 00:42:15,324
They turn on their night vision.

758
00:42:15,459 --> 00:42:17,047
You handle the first
wave, but you wait for me

759
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,485
after I've blinded
the remaining troops.

760
00:42:18,568 --> 00:42:19,768
I'm just going to wait for ya?

761
00:42:19,866 --> 00:42:21,169
It will only work if you wait.

762
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:22,504
Terrible plan.

763
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,786
Ava, you...

764
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:25,069
...find an escape vehicle.

765
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:29,645
Uh, what about me?

766
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:33,649
You stay behind me, Bob.

767
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,148
Let's do this.

768
00:42:42,988 --> 00:42:44,352
What's the latest?

769
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:46,054
We're dug in, ma'am.

770
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,558
Got it covered from all angles.

771
00:42:47,694 --> 00:42:48,992
There's no way out.

772
00:42:49,128 --> 00:42:50,499
Breach team ready at the front.

773
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:52,768
It's going to be
non-lethal protocol.

774
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,636
Non-lethal? No one told
me this was non-lethal.

775
00:42:55,772 --> 00:42:57,501
Well, I'm telling you now, Holt.

776
00:42:57,636 --> 00:42:59,070
It's just...

777
00:42:59,205 --> 00:43:01,244
I've spent a lot of time
planning for lethal.

778
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:03,235
Then change the plan. Okay?

779
00:43:03,371 --> 00:43:04,531
There's somebody inside there

780
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:06,044
I don't want
catching any strays.

781
00:43:06,613 --> 00:43:07,716
Get down!

782
00:43:09,948 --> 00:43:11,845
Strike Team 4, enter now.

783
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,480
Non-lethal.

784
00:43:32,534 --> 00:43:34,743
In one minute, these
all go back on.

785
00:43:35,772 --> 00:43:37,004
Okay.

786
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,346
Maybe I should have a gun?

787
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:39,973
Hmm. No, I don't think so.

788
00:43:40,109 --> 00:43:41,275
But we are gonna need...

789
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:42,770
We're gonna need to
fight, right? So...

790
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:45,248
Mm-hmm. I will fight.
You stay behind me.

791
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,615
The medical trial was
supposed to make me better,

792
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:52,123
and, I don't know, I feel
like maybe I could help.

793
00:43:54,021 --> 00:43:57,626
I thought you said that you
didn't know anything about it.

794
00:43:57,761 --> 00:44:00,264
No, not much. I just remember
they said it was for people

795
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,862
who wanted to make something
better of themselves.

796
00:44:03,998 --> 00:44:04,834
Mmm.

797
00:44:04,969 --> 00:44:07,171
You can trust me, Bob.

798
00:44:08,574 --> 00:44:09,574
Can I?

799
00:44:10,709 --> 00:44:11,840
No, not really.

800
00:44:16,384 --> 00:44:19,283
I... I've always had these
episodes since I was a kid.

801
00:44:19,418 --> 00:44:22,987
There's a... There's a high,
then there's a big low,

802
00:44:23,122 --> 00:44:25,662
and then my memory
just goes blank.

803
00:44:27,325 --> 00:44:29,390
But this time, I
feel like there's...

804
00:44:29,525 --> 00:44:31,233
I don't know,
something bad happened

805
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:32,658
or I did something bad.

806
00:44:32,793 --> 00:44:34,528
I mean, everyone here
has done bad things.

807
00:44:34,664 --> 00:44:37,031
I think this was like
a whole new kind of...

808
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:39,203
Oh.

809
00:44:40,541 --> 00:44:41,568
Lights up.

810
00:44:44,507 --> 00:44:48,014
No. Why... Why
did that not work?

811
00:44:48,149 --> 00:44:50,014
Well, you got to turn
the power back on.

812
00:44:50,149 --> 00:44:51,465
I mean, you got
to blind the guys.

813
00:44:51,548 --> 00:44:53,312
-Yeah, I know that, Bob.
-That was your plan.

814
00:44:53,448 --> 00:44:54,685
You're not being helpful, Bob.

815
00:44:54,821 --> 00:44:56,520
Give me that. Follow me.

816
00:44:56,656 --> 00:44:59,294
I hate to say it, but I think
Walter was right on this one.

817
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,555
His name is Walker, Bob.

818
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,190
Turn on the lights, Yelena.

819
00:45:10,168 --> 00:45:11,699
I got to do everything myself.

820
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:20,474
I will repeat,

821
00:45:20,609 --> 00:45:23,445
Tango Foxtrot Lima
requesting report.

822
00:45:26,018 --> 00:45:27,647
Next team up, get in there!

823
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,829
-Where is he?
-He's gone.

824
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:36,689
Every man for himself, right?

825
00:45:37,459 --> 00:45:38,691
-Shit.
-Oh.

826
00:45:55,716 --> 00:45:56,717
Get down!

827
00:45:56,852 --> 00:45:58,515
-I can help.
-Stay behind me.

828
00:46:00,621 --> 00:46:02,055
Bob, stay!

829
00:46:05,859 --> 00:46:07,286
That's it. You're done.

830
00:46:07,421 --> 00:46:09,260
No, wait! I can help!

831
00:46:14,565 --> 00:46:16,668
-Take this!
-Yes! How... How do I use it?

832
00:46:16,804 --> 00:46:18,338
You point and shoot.

833
00:46:18,473 --> 00:46:19,534
Shit.

834
00:46:23,505 --> 00:46:26,178
-Sorry!
-A little higher!

835
00:46:29,446 --> 00:46:31,580
-That was awesome.
-Not at me!

836
00:46:32,116 --> 00:46:34,250
No! Stop! Stop shooting!

837
00:46:34,386 --> 00:46:36,889
Stop! Stop! It's
me! It's John! Stop!

838
00:46:37,024 --> 00:46:39,352
-Where were you?
-Where were you?

839
00:46:39,488 --> 00:46:40,861
The explosion fried the wires.

840
00:46:40,997 --> 00:46:41,791
I told you, too many variables.

841
00:46:41,926 --> 00:46:43,361
I knew it.

842
00:46:43,496 --> 00:46:44,919
-And then, you didn't wait.
-I did wait! And the...

843
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,766
<i>What's going on in there?</i>

844
00:46:46,901 --> 00:46:47,965
<i>Do we need to go lethal?</i>

845
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,067
Okay.

846
00:46:50,202 --> 00:46:51,604
We probably got about 60 seconds

847
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:53,207
until they mobilize.

848
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,390
And if ghost lady actually
did what she was supposed to,

849
00:46:55,473 --> 00:46:58,078
maybe we'll all get
out of here alive.

850
00:47:05,617 --> 00:47:07,516
I don't really want
to be carried anymore.

851
00:47:07,652 --> 00:47:10,552
Shut up, Bob. You're
injured, remember?

852
00:47:25,071 --> 00:47:26,668
We need a truck.

853
00:47:27,237 --> 00:47:28,570
Where's Ava?

854
00:47:28,705 --> 00:47:32,171
She's gone. Of
course she's gone.

855
00:47:32,306 --> 00:47:34,015
Now what?

856
00:47:34,682 --> 00:47:36,446
Hey! Get in.

857
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,019
You going to be
okay back here?

858
00:47:41,154 --> 00:47:43,387
-Yeah. All good.
-Yeah? Okay.

859
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:50,490
Second time you came back.

860
00:47:50,626 --> 00:47:52,096
This was the only way out, okay?

861
00:47:52,231 --> 00:47:54,502
-That's all.
-All right.

862
00:47:54,637 --> 00:47:56,500
Oh, shit.

863
00:47:56,635 --> 00:47:58,519
All right. Just, uh, let
me do the talking, okay?

864
00:47:58,602 --> 00:48:00,668
-Oh, my God.
-Here we go.

865
00:48:05,914 --> 00:48:07,274
Identify yourself, soldiers.

866
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:08,609
Part of the medical team.

867
00:48:08,744 --> 00:48:10,414
Need to get the wounded
to the hospital.

868
00:48:10,549 --> 00:48:12,284
Medical bay's set
up north side.

869
00:48:12,419 --> 00:48:13,979
Nah, medical bay
won't suffice.

870
00:48:14,086 --> 00:48:15,615
We were headed off-base.

871
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:17,120
No one leaves the premises

872
00:48:17,255 --> 00:48:18,893
until mission is completed.

873
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,958
Orders are no deviations
from protocol.

874
00:48:22,093 --> 00:48:24,131
Identify yourself.

875
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:29,602
-No.
-Oh, wow, masterful.

876
00:48:30,404 --> 00:48:32,902
Remove your helmets
and identify yourself.

877
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:34,105
Now, soldiers!

878
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,396
You are messing
with the wrong...

879
00:48:47,018 --> 00:48:48,386
Hey!

880
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:50,685
Over here!

881
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,694
Oh, no. Bob helped.

882
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:03,933
Open fire. End this
now. I want him toes up.

883
00:49:10,506 --> 00:49:11,704
What the hell are you doing?

884
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,240
This has gone far...

885
00:49:13,948 --> 00:49:15,781
Cease fire! Cease fire!

886
00:49:15,917 --> 00:49:17,679
Cease fire!

887
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:23,553
Come on. Let's go.

888
00:49:25,459 --> 00:49:27,722
Come on. Let's go.
That's why he did it.

889
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:43,672
What the...

890
00:50:19,473 --> 00:50:20,610
Is that...

891
00:50:38,863 --> 00:50:41,502
Mel, I need you to connect
me to our satellites.

892
00:50:41,637 --> 00:50:44,699
I need to know exactly where
he's going, and I need it now.

893
00:50:44,835 --> 00:50:48,176
I, uh... I think he's
coming back down.

894
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:58,450
-No. No, no, no.
-Oh, shit.

895
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:28,645
Oh, God.

896
00:51:29,381 --> 00:51:31,286
I'll call an Uber.

897
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:32,787
Jesus Christ.

898
00:51:32,922 --> 00:51:34,655
I know. What was that?

899
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:36,625
That was her.

900
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:38,151
She did that to him.

901
00:51:38,286 --> 00:51:40,459
Well, she turned him into
a tomahawk cruise missile.

902
00:51:40,594 --> 00:51:43,693
You were right, she
definitely wants us dead.

903
00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:47,064
To test on someone like
that, it's inhuman.

904
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,264
Yeah, she's lost it.

905
00:51:48,399 --> 00:51:50,667
Nope. She's found it.

906
00:51:51,302 --> 00:51:52,904
And she'll use it.

907
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,374
What is this?

908
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:58,010
"Power of a thousand
exploding suns."

909
00:51:58,146 --> 00:51:59,780
"Golden Guardian of Good."

910
00:51:59,915 --> 00:52:01,348
That's a mouthful.

911
00:52:02,982 --> 00:52:04,219
Wow.

912
00:52:04,753 --> 00:52:06,186
Sentry.

913
00:52:06,322 --> 00:52:07,913
Very shiny, I'll give them that.

914
00:52:08,049 --> 00:52:09,310
What do you know about this?

915
00:52:09,393 --> 00:52:11,455
There was a rumor that
OXE was on the verge

916
00:52:11,591 --> 00:52:13,358
of some kind of
big breakthrough.

917
00:52:13,494 --> 00:52:15,291
Whatever it was was
way too extreme.

918
00:52:15,427 --> 00:52:16,922
Test subjects were dying.

919
00:52:17,057 --> 00:52:18,081
When the government
looked into it,

920
00:52:18,164 --> 00:52:19,098
Val shut it down.

921
00:52:19,233 --> 00:52:21,402
She put me on cleanup duty.

922
00:52:21,537 --> 00:52:24,135
Let's just make it home
without getting cratered.

923
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:25,574
Might need new homes.

924
00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:27,033
Anybody hungry?

925
00:52:28,306 --> 00:52:29,409
Cactus berry.

926
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:32,004
Let me see here.

927
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,744
So, um, that woman
back there that I...

928
00:52:37,249 --> 00:52:38,748
You knew her?

929
00:52:39,921 --> 00:52:41,190
Yeah, I did.

930
00:52:42,156 --> 00:52:43,821
She had a tough life.

931
00:52:43,956 --> 00:52:46,591
She killed a lot of people,
and then she got killed.

932
00:52:47,656 --> 00:52:49,121
Same as us someday.

933
00:52:49,932 --> 00:52:51,398
It's a shit life.

934
00:52:52,561 --> 00:52:53,796
Yeah, well...

935
00:52:54,532 --> 00:52:56,602
what other life can we have?

936
00:52:56,737 --> 00:52:59,235
Says the guy with the
Norman Rockwell family

937
00:52:59,371 --> 00:53:01,243
waiting for him at home.

938
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:04,741
Yeah.

939
00:53:05,948 --> 00:53:07,315
How do you do it?

940
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:13,387
Well, you just keep
working at it every day.

941
00:53:14,715 --> 00:53:16,049
Never give up.

942
00:53:18,157 --> 00:53:19,426
Beautiful.

943
00:53:20,495 --> 00:53:23,122
Dr. Phil, that was
really beautiful.

944
00:53:25,601 --> 00:53:28,003
Yeah. You know that show's
not on anymore, right?

945
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,437
Yeah, it is. I watch it.

946
00:53:29,572 --> 00:53:31,257
Nah, it got canceled
a few years ago.

947
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,071
It was a good show
while it was on,

948
00:53:33,207 --> 00:53:34,640
but it's not on anymore.

949
00:53:34,776 --> 00:53:37,576
Gotta be like a YouTube thing.
They took him off cable.

950
00:53:38,543 --> 00:53:40,111
Well, it isn't great.

951
00:53:40,247 --> 00:53:41,446
Seven local outlets

952
00:53:41,581 --> 00:53:43,061
have picked up the
story of the blast.

953
00:53:43,146 --> 00:53:45,277
One has already connected
the vault to OXE.

954
00:53:45,413 --> 00:53:48,021
And I have 15 messages from
concerned House members

955
00:53:48,157 --> 00:53:49,555
on our side of the aisle.

956
00:53:49,691 --> 00:53:51,208
You know, I don't
say it enough,

957
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:53,128
but I am so impressed

958
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:55,264
that in circumstances like this,

959
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,964
you can still get me
a good cup of coffee.

960
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,093
It's extraordinary.

961
00:54:00,562 --> 00:54:01,499
Thank you.

962
00:54:01,635 --> 00:54:03,029
Okay, time to pivot.

963
00:54:03,164 --> 00:54:05,173
I'm gonna need a new
team of scientists.

964
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:07,500
And I want them
there when we arrive.

965
00:54:07,635 --> 00:54:08,833
Okay. DC?

966
00:54:08,969 --> 00:54:11,245
Mm-mmm. No. The new place.

967
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,949
Oh. But, uh, we
stopped mid-renovation.

968
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:15,481
When we shut down the project.

969
00:54:15,617 --> 00:54:18,879
Exactly. We're
officially unshut down.

970
00:54:19,014 --> 00:54:21,481
What about Yelena
and the others?

971
00:54:21,616 --> 00:54:22,720
Nothing yet.

972
00:54:23,356 --> 00:54:25,193
Get rid of them, Mel.

973
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:27,428
They're the last
piece of evidence.

974
00:54:27,863 --> 00:54:29,255
On it.

975
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,470
Let me know when our boy in
the box gets to New York.

976
00:54:53,721 --> 00:54:55,521
Those birds are way too high.

977
00:54:55,656 --> 00:54:58,052
They're doing recon
loops at 4,000 feet.

978
00:54:58,187 --> 00:54:59,810
I mean, they don't know
what they're doing.

979
00:54:59,893 --> 00:55:01,893
They'll be five or ten
clicks away in no time.

980
00:55:02,029 --> 00:55:04,463
All right, Walker, we get
it. You were in the military.

981
00:55:04,598 --> 00:55:06,031
Five or ten clicks to the bird.

982
00:55:11,907 --> 00:55:13,133
There.

983
00:55:15,204 --> 00:55:18,847
Uh, it's a... I
don't... What is that?

984
00:55:22,544 --> 00:55:24,683
Oh, no.

985
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:26,580
What?

986
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:28,573
It's coming right at us.

987
00:55:28,656 --> 00:55:31,584
-Who is that?
-It's no one.

988
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,720
It's nothing.

989
00:55:41,897 --> 00:55:44,703
-Oh, God.
-Yelena!

990
00:55:45,569 --> 00:55:47,800
It's your dad!

991
00:55:47,935 --> 00:55:50,102
Don't go in the vault!

992
00:55:50,237 --> 00:55:54,042
Valentina's gonna
burn you alive!

993
00:55:56,512 --> 00:55:58,585
Yelena!

994
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,555
So, I finagled

995
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:04,784
to pick up Miss de
Fontaine at fancy event.

996
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,727
I figure good networking,

997
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,925
but as soon as I overhear
the coordinates of the vault,

998
00:56:10,061 --> 00:56:11,959
I rush home, I get
the tactical beast.

999
00:56:12,095 --> 00:56:14,035
And then, I drive straight here.

1000
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,797
Oh, America's so big.

1001
00:56:15,933 --> 00:56:17,531
You ever drive through Oklahoma?

1002
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:18,600
It's so flat.

1003
00:56:18,736 --> 00:56:20,035
Oh, I forgot to tell you,

1004
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,037
don't drink from the
Big Gulp back there.

1005
00:56:23,314 --> 00:56:24,705
Alexei, have you slept?

1006
00:56:24,841 --> 00:56:26,411
I'll sleep when I'm dead!

1007
00:56:26,547 --> 00:56:28,549
Uh, I'd like not to die today.

1008
00:56:28,684 --> 00:56:30,512
So maybe somebody else
should be driving.

1009
00:56:30,648 --> 00:56:31,649
Mr. Walker,

1010
00:56:31,785 --> 00:56:34,322
second coming of
Captain America.

1011
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:36,558
You and I have lot
in common, you know?

1012
00:56:36,694 --> 00:56:41,921
I too was state-sponsored
super soldier in Russia.

1013
00:56:42,056 --> 00:56:43,455
Mmm. But also very different

1014
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:45,698
because Walker actually
knows what he's doing.

1015
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:49,104
And Ghost. Ah,
what a magician.

1016
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,572
You disappear. You reappear.

1017
00:56:51,707 --> 00:56:53,338
When you reappear,
does sometimes things

1018
00:56:53,474 --> 00:56:54,906
not pop up in right place?

1019
00:56:55,041 --> 00:56:57,469
Oh. I find it best just
to ignore him sometimes.

1020
00:56:57,604 --> 00:56:59,774
What impressive friends
you've assembled, Yelena.

1021
00:56:59,909 --> 00:57:01,140
We are not friends, Alexei.

1022
00:57:01,276 --> 00:57:03,182
Nah. We're just
disposable delinquents.

1023
00:57:03,317 --> 00:57:04,585
Whatever you are,

1024
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,181
the light inside you
is brighter, Yelena.

1025
00:57:08,816 --> 00:57:10,018
How about this?

1026
00:57:10,153 --> 00:57:13,854
You are a team of
scrappy antiheroes.

1027
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:16,729
-Yeah. Go Thunderbolts.
-What?

1028
00:57:17,499 --> 00:57:18,830
-Yelena...
-Oh, my God.

1029
00:57:18,966 --> 00:57:20,487
You named them after
your peewee soccer club?

1030
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:22,394
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1031
00:57:22,529 --> 00:57:25,005
The West Chesapeake
Valley Thunderbolts.

1032
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:26,466
Sponsored by

1033
00:57:26,601 --> 00:57:28,455
Dmitri's Elite Industrial
Lighting and Electronics.

1034
00:57:28,538 --> 00:57:29,142
No, no.

1035
00:57:29,277 --> 00:57:31,872
Never won a game,

1036
00:57:32,007 --> 00:57:33,742
but Yelena had so much fun.

1037
00:57:33,878 --> 00:57:35,109
There was a girl who pooped...

1038
00:57:35,245 --> 00:57:37,145
-No. It was... It was not...
-...in one game.

1039
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,487
It was crazy. I was
yelling at the ref.

1040
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:42,254
It was sponsored by
Shane's Tire Shop.

1041
00:57:42,389 --> 00:57:43,524
-Shane?
-Yes.

1042
00:57:43,659 --> 00:57:45,327
-What's this talk of Shane?
-It was.

1043
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,889
He didn't have
that kind of money.

1044
00:57:47,025 --> 00:57:48,954
-Yes, it was.
-No! Shane? What a joke.

1045
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,322
You really need to sleep.

1046
00:57:50,457 --> 00:57:52,929
Okay. What about this
Bob you mentioned?

1047
00:57:53,064 --> 00:57:54,728
What's the plan?
Where am I driving?

1048
00:57:54,864 --> 00:57:56,031
It's not like that.

1049
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:57,901
We need to escape
and we need to hide.

1050
00:57:58,037 --> 00:57:59,384
Yeah, way smarter
for us to split up.

1051
00:57:59,467 --> 00:58:01,307
There's actually an
airfield not far from here.

1052
00:58:01,435 --> 00:58:02,715
We'll just disappear from there.

1053
00:58:02,806 --> 00:58:04,971
Split up? No, no, no.

1054
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,271
You may not see what I see,

1055
00:58:06,407 --> 00:58:08,508
but I have been
around long time.

1056
00:58:08,644 --> 00:58:09,882
No shit.

1057
00:58:10,018 --> 00:58:13,580
This has the makings of a
team that can raise to glory.

1058
00:58:14,483 --> 00:58:17,791
A team that can bring
light from the darkness.

1059
00:58:17,926 --> 00:58:22,562
A team of heroes that can
be on the Wheaties box

1060
00:58:22,698 --> 00:58:26,326
-and have little kiddie toy...
-No, no.

1061
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,295
This is not a marketing
opportunity, okay?

1062
00:58:29,431 --> 00:58:32,271
Valentina is hunting
us, and we cannot win.

1063
00:58:32,406 --> 00:58:33,608
Do you understand?

1064
00:58:33,743 --> 00:58:35,370
-You don't understand.
-I do. You don't.

1065
00:58:35,506 --> 00:58:37,973
Look, you say that Valentina
is going to use the power

1066
00:58:38,109 --> 00:58:39,223
-of this Sentry Project...
-Yes.

1067
00:58:39,306 --> 00:58:40,909
...to take over
and kill us all.

1068
00:58:41,044 --> 00:58:43,480
Then you need to
stand up to her.

1069
00:58:43,615 --> 00:58:45,343
You and your team.

1070
00:58:45,479 --> 00:58:47,455
You got a convoy
approaching fast.

1071
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:50,185
-Step on it.
-Aye, aye, Captain.

1072
00:58:57,563 --> 00:58:58,766
Is that it?

1073
00:58:58,901 --> 00:59:01,726
-Okay, any time now.
-Yeah. We're working on it.

1074
00:59:01,862 --> 00:59:03,881
-A little bit faster.
-Takes a second.

1075
00:59:03,964 --> 00:59:05,068
Alexei!

1076
00:59:10,107 --> 00:59:11,545
-Alexei!
-Okay! Don't worry!

1077
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:13,974
Don't worry. She's
bulletproof, huh?

1078
00:59:14,109 --> 00:59:16,476
Engaging defensive measures.

1079
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,780
What the hell?

1080
00:59:20,915 --> 00:59:22,284
Oh, my God.

1081
00:59:22,419 --> 00:59:24,145
Oh, shit. Wait, that's
not supposed to do that.

1082
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:25,255
Oh, my God.

1083
00:59:25,391 --> 00:59:26,160
Come on.

1084
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:27,992
Who are you driving?

1085
00:59:29,924 --> 00:59:31,457
Walker, shield!

1086
00:59:33,296 --> 00:59:34,996
What happened to "bulletproof"?

1087
00:59:35,132 --> 00:59:36,603
-Bulletproof-ish.
-Jesus Christ!

1088
00:59:36,738 --> 00:59:39,201
God, everyone's a critic today!

1089
00:59:40,601 --> 00:59:43,005
Time to break out
the bottle service.

1090
00:59:43,141 --> 00:59:45,308
Come on, Ghost, give
me the good stuff.

1091
00:59:45,944 --> 00:59:47,478
Okay, not really appropriate.

1092
00:59:47,613 --> 00:59:49,451
Vodka! Vodka, now!

1093
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:52,244
Oh, my God. This
is so not the time.

1094
00:59:52,379 --> 00:59:55,217
What's wrong with you?

1095
01:00:07,962 --> 01:00:09,099
No, no, no!

1096
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,236
Give me a break.

1097
01:00:16,537 --> 01:00:19,780
Okay, I'll be back. I hope.

1098
01:00:39,098 --> 01:00:41,369
Yelena! What are you doing?

1099
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:43,265
There's nothing you can do.

1100
01:00:50,038 --> 01:00:51,240
What?

1101
01:01:12,598 --> 01:01:14,098
It's Bucky!

1102
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,299
The Winter Soldier.

1103
01:02:04,612 --> 01:02:07,817
That's what I talk about!

1104
01:02:07,953 --> 01:02:10,187
-Yes! Yeah!
-Woo!

1105
01:02:17,057 --> 01:02:18,162
Oh, sh...

1106
01:02:27,741 --> 01:02:28,874
Congressman!

1107
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:30,223
Why did you call an
emergency session

1108
01:02:30,306 --> 01:02:31,608
of the impeachment committee?

1109
01:02:31,744 --> 01:02:33,112
What I can say

1110
01:02:33,247 --> 01:02:34,593
is that I've gotten a
tip from a trusted cohort

1111
01:02:34,676 --> 01:02:36,748
that will be bringing
some new evidence in,

1112
01:02:36,883 --> 01:02:38,114
and that evidence is juicy.

1113
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:40,414
The impeachment was
just an appetizer.

1114
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:42,416
They should be getting
a nice, cozy cell

1115
01:02:42,552 --> 01:02:45,453
in federal prison ready
for Miss Fontaine.

1116
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:47,390
I just got word

1117
01:02:47,525 --> 01:02:48,811
the impeachment committee
is convening tonight.

1118
01:02:48,894 --> 01:02:50,194
This is serious, Val.

1119
01:02:50,329 --> 01:02:52,294
Were you able to get the
lab fully operational?

1120
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:54,028
Yes, but the rest
of the building

1121
01:02:54,163 --> 01:02:55,330
is only 70% finished.

1122
01:02:55,466 --> 01:02:57,669
Okay. Mel, we'll get it there.

1123
01:02:57,805 --> 01:02:59,599
Welcome to the Watchtower.

1124
01:03:02,774 --> 01:03:03,876
Val?

1125
01:03:04,011 --> 01:03:05,313
Something happened in Malaysia.

1126
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:06,604
Have you read his file?

1127
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:08,477
Delusions of
grandeur, depression.

1128
01:03:08,613 --> 01:03:12,481
Someone that imbalanced
amplified by the treatment...

1129
01:03:12,617 --> 01:03:16,383
The people in the labs, they
were just test subjects.

1130
01:03:16,519 --> 01:03:18,088
They were never
gonna be the one.

1131
01:03:18,224 --> 01:03:20,521
Does this look nurturing enough?

1132
01:03:22,323 --> 01:03:24,294
Very nurturing.

1133
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:32,736
Hi. How... How are
you feeling, Robert?

1134
01:03:32,872 --> 01:03:34,502
Are you comfortable?

1135
01:03:35,773 --> 01:03:37,043
Yeah.

1136
01:03:37,178 --> 01:03:41,278
My name is Valentina
Allegra de Fontaine.

1137
01:03:41,413 --> 01:03:43,749
Oh, no, no, no. You...
You tried to kill us,

1138
01:03:43,885 --> 01:03:45,986
didn't you?

1139
01:03:49,652 --> 01:03:52,421
Let me explain. Would...
Would you like that?

1140
01:03:53,791 --> 01:03:55,127
Yeah.

1141
01:03:55,263 --> 01:03:57,793
You signed up for a
medical study which was,

1142
01:03:57,929 --> 01:03:59,296
as advertised,

1143
01:03:59,431 --> 01:04:01,899
at the cutting edge
of human improvement.

1144
01:04:02,035 --> 01:04:04,103
But not everybody could handle

1145
01:04:04,238 --> 01:04:06,165
the amount of greatness
that we had in mind.

1146
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:08,166
What happened to Yelena?

1147
01:04:08,301 --> 01:04:10,536
Yelena? Oh.

1148
01:04:10,672 --> 01:04:12,173
Well, those people
you were with,

1149
01:04:12,308 --> 01:04:13,507
those are not honest people.

1150
01:04:13,642 --> 01:04:16,375
They're criminals.
Villains, really.

1151
01:04:16,511 --> 01:04:19,481
No, no. They... They helped me.

1152
01:04:21,819 --> 01:04:23,321
Robert.

1153
01:04:23,457 --> 01:04:26,158
Let's just forget about
them, and let's focus on you.

1154
01:04:26,761 --> 01:04:28,457
And how perfect you are.

1155
01:04:30,896 --> 01:04:32,197
Perfect, huh?

1156
01:04:32,332 --> 01:04:34,265
You always thought of
yourself as a victim.

1157
01:04:35,065 --> 01:04:36,669
But you overcame.

1158
01:04:36,804 --> 01:04:38,368
You went to Malaysia.

1159
01:04:38,503 --> 01:04:41,107
You were lost, right?
You were searching.

1160
01:04:42,303 --> 01:04:43,811
And you found me.

1161
01:04:43,947 --> 01:04:46,777
How... How do you
know all that?

1162
01:04:46,912 --> 01:04:48,113
I know all of it.

1163
01:04:48,249 --> 01:04:50,217
I know about your
mom's mental illness.

1164
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:53,549
I know about your addiction
and your juvenile record.

1165
01:04:53,685 --> 01:04:56,556
I mean, I even know about
the times your father...

1166
01:04:56,691 --> 01:04:57,891
Stop! No, no, no.

1167
01:04:58,027 --> 01:04:59,620
I didn't say you
could know that.

1168
01:05:02,363 --> 01:05:05,261
Robert, I know
everything about you.

1169
01:05:05,397 --> 01:05:08,101
And I still want
you to be my guy.

1170
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:11,463
And isn't that what you want?

1171
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:14,767
To be accepted? To be chosen?

1172
01:05:15,876 --> 01:05:18,346
No one else sees it,

1173
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:19,841
but I do.

1174
01:05:19,976 --> 01:05:24,546
And I think maybe your past
is what makes you so perfect.

1175
01:05:33,122 --> 01:05:35,128
<font color="#ffff54">Stay quiet, Valentina.</font>

1176
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:37,917
<font color="#ffff54">Completely quiet, no
matter what you hear.</font>

1177
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,095
<font color="#ffff54">You promise me?</font>

1178
01:05:39,096 --> 01:05:40,776
<font color="#ffff54">Did I do something wrong?</font>

1179
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:43,667
<font color="#ffff54">The man in town
asked where we live.</font>

1180
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:46,500
<font color="#ffff54">He said he was your
friend, so I told him.</font>

1181
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:48,042
<font color="#ffff54">Yes, well he was.</font>

1182
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:51,000
<font color="#ffff54">Remember I told you
not to talk to anyone?</font>

1183
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:53,292
<font color="#ffff54">Yes, daddy. I'm so sorry.</font>

1184
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:56,244
<font color="#ffff54">It's okay. Just
stay hidden for me.</font>

1185
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:04,458
<font color="#ffff54">You know...</font>

1186
01:06:04,542 --> 01:06:06,708
<font color="#ffff54">I've been in this
business a long time.</font>

1187
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:11,000
<font color="#ffff54">There's always someone
like you, smart, but cocky.</font>

1188
01:06:11,083 --> 01:06:13,290
<font color="#ffff54">A hungry dog who already
had a bone in his mouth.</font>

1189
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:15,399
<font color="#ffff54">Let's have a drink, shall we?</font>

1190
01:06:16,032 --> 01:06:18,600
<font color="#ffff54">You still think you're
getting away with this.</font>

1191
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:22,208
<font color="#ffff54">Don't worry, I'll look out
for your sweet Valentina.</font>

1192
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:33,351
Would you excuse me
just for a moment?

1193
01:06:40,095 --> 01:06:42,327
No. All right.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

1194
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:47,497
I can control it.

1195
01:06:52,607 --> 01:06:53,668
Great.

1196
01:06:59,013 --> 01:07:00,211
<i>All right.</i>

1197
01:07:00,347 --> 01:07:02,173
Let's get the press
here in the morning.

1198
01:07:02,308 --> 01:07:04,227
It's time to show everyone
what I've been working on.

1199
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:07,821
Val, you put a serum into
someone like Steve Rogers,

1200
01:07:07,956 --> 01:07:09,156
he becomes Captain America,

1201
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:12,323
but you do it to
someone this unstable,

1202
01:07:12,459 --> 01:07:14,159
I mean, who knows
what it did to him?

1203
01:07:14,294 --> 01:07:16,060
That's why we build
in safeguards.

1204
01:07:16,196 --> 01:07:17,628
Didn't we make a kill switch?

1205
01:07:17,764 --> 01:07:21,163
Yeah, but we threw it out
along with everything else.

1206
01:07:21,298 --> 01:07:23,169
Well, then remake it.

1207
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:26,301
I don't really care
who this guy was.

1208
01:07:26,437 --> 01:07:29,077
I do know what he can become.

1209
01:07:30,245 --> 01:07:32,641
Get the press here like I asked.

1210
01:07:42,154 --> 01:07:44,321
No, no, no, no!

1211
01:07:44,456 --> 01:07:47,360
Just when I get
my team together.

1212
01:07:47,495 --> 01:07:51,325
Mr. Soldier, you are
making terrible mistake.

1213
01:07:51,461 --> 01:07:53,468
Save it for the committee.

1214
01:07:53,603 --> 01:07:54,668
What committee?

1215
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:56,037
You're all evidence

1216
01:07:56,173 --> 01:07:57,286
in the impeachment
trial against Valentina.

1217
01:07:58,769 --> 01:08:00,320
We don't even work
for Valentina anymore.

1218
01:08:00,403 --> 01:08:01,770
She tried to kill us.

1219
01:08:01,905 --> 01:08:03,560
We were ordered to destroy
all of her secrets,

1220
01:08:03,643 --> 01:08:05,159
but really, we were just
sent to kill each other

1221
01:08:05,242 --> 01:08:06,409
in this vault.

1222
01:08:06,545 --> 01:08:07,873
-But then we met Bob.
-Yeah. Bob.

1223
01:08:08,009 --> 01:08:09,982
There was a man in the vault.

1224
01:08:10,117 --> 01:08:11,247
She's done something to him.

1225
01:08:11,382 --> 01:08:13,011
It's called Project Sentry.

1226
01:08:13,146 --> 01:08:15,684
Okay, he shot up into
the sky. He exploded.

1227
01:08:15,819 --> 01:08:17,339
And then he crashed
into this mountain,

1228
01:08:17,455 --> 01:08:18,695
and then he died, didn't die...

1229
01:08:18,788 --> 01:08:21,024
Yes, I got it. He's
very, very scary.

1230
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:22,620
-So rude.
-Okay.

1231
01:08:22,755 --> 01:08:24,594
"Congressman Barnes."

1232
01:08:26,362 --> 01:08:27,597
All right, Walker.

1233
01:08:28,565 --> 01:08:29,927
What's that supposed to mean?

1234
01:08:30,063 --> 01:08:31,670
Means you know me, Bucky.

1235
01:08:31,806 --> 01:08:34,172
So cut the shit and listen to
what we're trying to tell you.

1236
01:08:34,307 --> 01:08:35,455
Yeah, I know you, John,

1237
01:08:35,538 --> 01:08:38,042
and you made your choices.

1238
01:08:38,177 --> 01:08:39,444
I know it's been hard

1239
01:08:39,579 --> 01:08:40,757
since Olivia left you
and took your kid,

1240
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,118
but still, this is on you.

1241
01:08:46,345 --> 01:08:49,221
Bucky, there won't be
a committee left. Okay?

1242
01:08:49,357 --> 01:08:50,922
There might not even
be a government.

1243
01:08:51,057 --> 01:08:52,255
She has some big...

1244
01:08:52,391 --> 01:08:54,260
Threat. Yes. I got it.

1245
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:57,292
Named "Bob" or "Sentry"
who flies. Right?

1246
01:08:57,427 --> 01:08:58,593
And you're all heroes

1247
01:08:58,729 --> 01:09:00,085
going after Val,
ready to save the day.

1248
01:09:00,168 --> 01:09:01,352
Am I supposed to believe that?

1249
01:09:01,435 --> 01:09:02,835
We weren't going
after her together.

1250
01:09:02,966 --> 01:09:04,585
We were just trying to
get home alive, actually.

1251
01:09:04,668 --> 01:09:06,241
That's even more pathetic.

1252
01:09:06,376 --> 01:09:07,918
Yeah, I know. That's what
I've been telling them.

1253
01:09:08,001 --> 01:09:09,440
-Shut up.
-No, you shut up.

1254
01:09:09,576 --> 01:09:11,243
All right. Plane
lands in six minutes.

1255
01:09:11,379 --> 01:09:12,944
-Will you be quiet?
-Yes?

1256
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,678
Bucky, I need your help.

1257
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,213
What is it?

1258
01:09:16,348 --> 01:09:18,450
Val has gone off the rails.

1259
01:09:18,585 --> 01:09:20,655
I mean, Project Sentry,
it's not just a failure,

1260
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:21,886
<i>it's dangerous.</i>

1261
01:09:22,021 --> 01:09:22,920
Project Sentry?

1262
01:09:25,055 --> 01:09:26,823
<i>She has too much
power in her hands.</i>

1263
01:09:26,958 --> 01:09:30,195
<i>And this guy is a disaster
waiting to happen.</i>

1264
01:09:30,330 --> 01:09:32,631
-What guy?
-Bob.

1265
01:09:32,767 --> 01:09:34,026
Bob?

1266
01:09:34,428 --> 01:09:35,533
Bob!

1267
01:09:35,668 --> 01:09:37,328
<i>We're at the old
Avengers place.</i>

1268
01:09:37,463 --> 01:09:39,189
<i>The press are set to
come tomorrow morning.</i>

1269
01:09:39,272 --> 01:09:40,969
Someone has to do something.

1270
01:09:41,104 --> 01:09:44,003
Shit. Okay, I... I have to
go. But come now, please.

1271
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:45,977
<i>Bring anyone.
Everyone you can.</i>

1272
01:09:54,888 --> 01:09:55,779
Bob.

1273
01:09:55,915 --> 01:09:57,821
-Bob.
-How many times?

1274
01:09:57,957 --> 01:09:59,227
I know.

1275
01:10:00,092 --> 01:10:01,757
It's bad, Bucky.

1276
01:10:11,438 --> 01:10:13,505
Hang on. What are you doing?

1277
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,872
I'm letting you go.
You're coming with me.

1278
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:16,941
Why?

1279
01:10:18,815 --> 01:10:20,639
For the glory.

1280
01:10:20,775 --> 01:10:22,248
Well, you know Valentina.

1281
01:10:22,383 --> 01:10:24,484
She's got this thing out there.

1282
01:10:24,619 --> 01:10:27,118
People are gonna get hurt,
and I gotta stop her.

1283
01:10:27,254 --> 01:10:28,722
And you are gonna help me.

1284
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:30,221
Wait. Us?

1285
01:10:30,357 --> 01:10:32,524
Why? You got some place to be?

1286
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:36,187
Bucky, you have
the wrong people.

1287
01:10:39,564 --> 01:10:42,028
Look, I've been where you are.

1288
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,330
You can run, but
it doesn't go away.

1289
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:47,424
Sooner or later it
catches up to you,

1290
01:10:47,507 --> 01:10:49,508
and when it does, it's too late.

1291
01:10:51,745 --> 01:10:54,315
So you can either do
something about it now,

1292
01:10:55,677 --> 01:10:57,252
or live with it forever.

1293
01:11:07,887 --> 01:11:10,023
Stop Val and save Bob.

1294
01:11:11,891 --> 01:11:12,930
-Fine.
-Mmm?

1295
01:11:13,065 --> 01:11:14,401
Yeah.

1296
01:11:17,532 --> 01:11:18,570
Go on, then.

1297
01:11:20,468 --> 01:11:23,402
Yes!

1298
01:11:23,537 --> 01:11:24,774
Yeah!

1299
01:11:30,078 --> 01:11:32,419
What'd you think this
job was gonna be?

1300
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:38,053
I don't know. I hope
I've done some good.

1301
01:11:38,189 --> 01:11:39,624
"Good."

1302
01:11:40,491 --> 01:11:42,662
Good girl. Good enough.

1303
01:11:44,231 --> 01:11:45,730
You want to be good?

1304
01:11:45,865 --> 01:11:48,831
Or do you want to be somebody
who changes the world?

1305
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,702
Can't I be both?

1306
01:11:50,837 --> 01:11:53,104
I mean, I thought you
wanted to change the world

1307
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,641
for the better too.

1308
01:11:54,776 --> 01:11:59,279
Mel, righteousness without
power is just an opinion.

1309
01:11:59,414 --> 01:12:02,315
Look, you're brought
up to believe

1310
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:04,451
that there's a good
guy and a bad guy.

1311
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:07,544
But then eventually,
you come to realize

1312
01:12:08,314 --> 01:12:12,118
that there's a bad
guy and a worse guy.

1313
01:12:12,753 --> 01:12:14,053
And nothing else.

1314
01:12:14,188 --> 01:12:17,024
Let me know when to
come to your senses.

1315
01:12:24,305 --> 01:12:25,765
Um, I don't know.

1316
01:12:25,901 --> 01:12:27,499
Okay, yeah. We just try again.

1317
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:28,205
Yeah.

1318
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:30,303
Let's just focus.

1319
01:12:30,439 --> 01:12:31,577
Mmm.

1320
01:12:32,707 --> 01:12:33,744
I believe in you.

1321
01:12:58,766 --> 01:13:00,133
I can do that?

1322
01:13:01,968 --> 01:13:03,609
You can do anything.

1323
01:13:04,678 --> 01:13:07,274
People think they know you.

1324
01:13:07,843 --> 01:13:09,641
They just see you as "Bob."

1325
01:13:09,777 --> 01:13:11,177
They pity Bob.

1326
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,617
I'm the only one who knows

1327
01:13:13,753 --> 01:13:16,490
what your true
potential is, Robert.

1328
01:13:17,951 --> 01:13:19,123
And it's limitless.

1329
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,695
Ready for the next lesson?

1330
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:37,641
And then I have these
little, Widow...

1331
01:13:37,776 --> 01:13:39,447
...bite things.

1332
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:41,133
-And in the left...
-Yeah. I... I remember.

1333
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:43,616
And then I have this 19.

1334
01:13:44,418 --> 01:13:46,821
Forty-five. The long barrel.

1335
01:13:46,956 --> 01:13:48,146
Mmm.

1336
01:13:48,282 --> 01:13:49,784
-Wow. It's big.
-Yeah. Well, it's...

1337
01:13:49,919 --> 01:13:50,950
-It's long.
-Mmm.

1338
01:13:51,085 --> 01:13:52,483
-Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1339
01:13:52,618 --> 01:13:54,338
-Okay, it's a little long.
-Yeah. Big gun.

1340
01:13:54,421 --> 01:13:56,856
And, uh... your...
what about your hat?

1341
01:13:56,992 --> 01:13:59,531
Uh, the hat? The... The helmet?

1342
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:01,533
Yeah. Whatever you
want to call it.

1343
01:14:01,669 --> 01:14:03,829
It's, like, cool.
Right? You like it?

1344
01:14:03,965 --> 01:14:06,034
Do... Do you like the hat?

1345
01:14:07,774 --> 01:14:10,035
Yeah, I think the
hat's pretty...

1346
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:11,312
-pretty sweet.
-Then, cool.

1347
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:13,679
What kind of super
serum did you get?

1348
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:16,983
I don't know. Regular. Hydra.

1349
01:14:17,118 --> 01:14:18,118
Hydra? Oh.

1350
01:14:18,219 --> 01:14:19,787
-Fancy.
-Yes.

1351
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:22,788
Mine was Soviet recreation.
But it's still good, you know?

1352
01:14:24,318 --> 01:14:26,285
-We are same. You and me.
-Well...

1353
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,694
I mean, we are different,
but we are same.

1354
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:30,756
You know, we could be
coleaders in this, huh?

1355
01:14:30,891 --> 01:14:31,823
Little different.

1356
01:14:31,959 --> 01:14:34,231
You get tired, I drive.

1357
01:14:34,366 --> 01:14:35,695
Huh?

1358
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:36,763
I don't get tired.

1359
01:14:36,899 --> 01:14:38,063
No, I mean metaphorically.

1360
01:14:38,198 --> 01:14:39,390
I don't actually want to drive.

1361
01:14:39,473 --> 01:14:40,898
Are we there yet?

1362
01:14:41,033 --> 01:14:42,636
-Almost!
-Almost!

1363
01:14:44,175 --> 01:14:49,550
Okay. Mr. Soldier, what
is secret plan, huh?

1364
01:14:50,448 --> 01:14:51,475
The plan?

1365
01:14:51,844 --> 01:14:53,081
Yeah.

1366
01:15:05,158 --> 01:15:06,567
I like this plan.

1367
01:15:38,393 --> 01:15:39,719
<i>Jesus, you guys,</i>

1368
01:15:39,802 --> 01:15:41,327
<i>I literally just
put that drywall in.</i>

1369
01:15:41,462 --> 01:15:44,004
<i>I left the door
unlocked for you.</i>

1370
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:45,398
<i>Come up.</i>

1371
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:05,517
How crazy is it to think of
all the monumental fights

1372
01:16:05,652 --> 01:16:09,058
that happened exactly here
where you're standing?

1373
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:12,257
Eh. I don't really care.

1374
01:16:12,393 --> 01:16:14,267
I mean, the place wasn't cheap,

1375
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,294
but it's got good optics.

1376
01:16:16,430 --> 01:16:18,038
Well, it's over, Valentina.

1377
01:16:18,173 --> 01:16:19,634
This ends today.

1378
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:21,541
Congressman Barnes, wow.

1379
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:23,138
You know, I never really thought

1380
01:16:23,273 --> 01:16:25,674
you'd have a promising
political career.

1381
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:28,176
But less than half a term?

1382
01:16:28,776 --> 01:16:30,013
Yikes.

1383
01:16:30,848 --> 01:16:32,246
We're taking you in, Val.

1384
01:16:33,816 --> 01:16:35,050
I don't think so.

1385
01:16:35,186 --> 01:16:38,219
Junior Varsity
Captain America.

1386
01:16:39,084 --> 01:16:40,452
Walker.

1387
01:16:41,793 --> 01:16:44,093
Oh, nice to see you, Ava.

1388
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:48,361
Yelena. You look awful.

1389
01:16:49,097 --> 01:16:50,496
You sure you're really ready

1390
01:16:50,631 --> 01:16:52,473
for that public facing
role you asked me about?

1391
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:55,399
Eat shit, Valentina.
Where's Bob?

1392
01:16:55,535 --> 01:16:58,813
Look at you. You
are all so adorable.

1393
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:02,145
Just think, I send you down
there to kill each other,

1394
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:06,016
and instead, you make
nice and you form a team.

1395
01:17:06,982 --> 01:17:08,480
Who's this old Santa?

1396
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:11,351
I'm Alexei Shostakov.

1397
01:17:12,987 --> 01:17:14,486
The Red Guardian.

1398
01:17:15,691 --> 01:17:16,730
What?

1399
01:17:18,324 --> 01:17:19,759
-Where's Mel?
-Mel?

1400
01:17:19,895 --> 01:17:21,129
Oh, Mel. Yeah.

1401
01:17:21,265 --> 01:17:24,303
Uh, Mel is having a
little loyalty issue.

1402
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:26,807
But I'm just so grateful

1403
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:30,601
that she stayed long
enough to lure you all in.

1404
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:36,112
I'm not alone.

1405
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:38,378
Robert?

1406
01:17:42,686 --> 01:17:43,724
Oh, my God.

1407
01:17:45,854 --> 01:17:46,789
That's Bob?

1408
01:17:46,924 --> 01:17:49,323
Yeah, he's changed a little.

1409
01:17:51,290 --> 01:17:54,359
It is my great honor

1410
01:17:54,495 --> 01:17:57,430
to introduce to you The Sentry.

1411
01:17:59,098 --> 01:18:00,307
Hey, guys.

1412
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:02,907
Wow. That's cool name.

1413
01:18:03,043 --> 01:18:05,637
All-powerful. Invincible.

1414
01:18:05,773 --> 01:18:08,783
Stronger than all of the
Avengers rolled into one.

1415
01:18:08,918 --> 01:18:14,183
And soon to be known as
Earth's mightiest hero.

1416
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:17,049
Have you dyed your hair?

1417
01:18:17,184 --> 01:18:18,820
Yeah. Well, it was...

1418
01:18:18,955 --> 01:18:20,222
Yeah, it was my idea.

1419
01:18:21,024 --> 01:18:23,387
People love a classic hero.

1420
01:18:23,522 --> 01:18:26,095
Okay, I'll bite.
What's the plan?

1421
01:18:26,231 --> 01:18:28,035
You haven't figured
it out yet, Bucky?

1422
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:29,328
Geez.

1423
01:18:29,464 --> 01:18:30,657
Well, at least
you're kind of cute.

1424
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:33,070
You're not going to hurt people.

1425
01:18:33,604 --> 01:18:34,364
Oh, no.

1426
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,705
No, I'm not gonna hurt people.

1427
01:18:36,841 --> 01:18:38,174
I'm gonna hurt you.

1428
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:41,476
You see, the press is
on their way here now.

1429
01:18:41,612 --> 01:18:44,446
And they're gonna witness
the awesome power of Sentry

1430
01:18:44,581 --> 01:18:48,915
as he takes down this ruthless
group of rogue agents,

1431
01:18:49,051 --> 01:18:50,815
thus beginning a new era

1432
01:18:50,951 --> 01:18:55,053
in which I decide how to keep
the American people safe,

1433
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:57,028
answering to no one.

1434
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:00,192
I'll be unimpeachable.

1435
01:19:00,328 --> 01:19:03,260
That's... never gonna happen.

1436
01:19:04,096 --> 01:19:09,744
Sentry, your first mission is
to take out these criminals.

1437
01:19:14,044 --> 01:19:16,444
I don't wanna hurt you guys.

1438
01:19:16,579 --> 01:19:19,379
Why don't you just
turn yourselves in?

1439
01:19:19,514 --> 01:19:22,251
No, you don't wanna
do this, Bobby.

1440
01:19:23,119 --> 01:19:24,886
You can call me The Sentry.

1441
01:19:25,021 --> 01:19:26,121
Please, don't do this.

1442
01:19:26,256 --> 01:19:27,718
You do not need
to listen to her.

1443
01:19:27,853 --> 01:19:30,223
Robert, they don't think
you're good enough.

1444
01:19:30,359 --> 01:19:32,466
-That's not true.
-Remember?

1445
01:19:32,602 --> 01:19:35,165
You can trust me. I know you.

1446
01:19:36,968 --> 01:19:38,465
I don't think that you do.

1447
01:19:42,036 --> 01:19:43,734
Enough talking!

1448
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:45,538
No one messes

1449
01:19:45,673 --> 01:19:50,243
with the West Chesapeake
Valley Thunderbolts!

1450
01:19:50,378 --> 01:19:52,347
Thunderbolts?

1451
01:19:55,183 --> 01:19:57,286
Hey. No, no, no! No!

1452
01:20:01,021 --> 01:20:02,260
Wait!

1453
01:20:02,396 --> 01:20:03,523
Bob, no!

1454
01:20:10,803 --> 01:20:12,037
Alexei, wait!

1455
01:20:48,003 --> 01:20:49,371
Stop, Bob.

1456
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,904
I'm so glad you were
able to catch a glimpse

1457
01:21:56,039 --> 01:21:57,441
before your, uh...

1458
01:21:57,943 --> 01:21:59,342
retirement.

1459
01:22:01,145 --> 01:22:03,780
Camera crews are assembling.

1460
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:05,414
Finish the job, Robert.

1461
01:22:06,754 --> 01:22:08,186
Finish the job?

1462
01:22:09,853 --> 01:22:11,090
No.

1463
01:22:12,152 --> 01:22:13,722
What?

1464
01:22:13,857 --> 01:22:17,756
They're not a threat to me,
so why do I need to kill them?

1465
01:22:19,462 --> 01:22:22,134
You need to do
what I say, Robert.

1466
01:22:25,099 --> 01:22:26,336
Why?

1467
01:22:27,772 --> 01:22:29,009
"Why"?

1468
01:22:33,242 --> 01:22:36,243
Okay. We need new plan.

1469
01:22:36,378 --> 01:22:39,116
Nah, no new plans.

1470
01:22:39,252 --> 01:22:42,185
That thing is just too powerful.

1471
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,551
We just need to
regroup and think.

1472
01:22:44,687 --> 01:22:46,287
There's got to be a
way to stop that guy.

1473
01:22:46,392 --> 01:22:48,032
Oh, my God. We're
not regrouping.

1474
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:50,090
-This isn't even a team.
-Of course we're a team.

1475
01:22:50,226 --> 01:22:51,863
We are the Thunderbolts.

1476
01:22:51,999 --> 01:22:53,230
I don't know what that means.

1477
01:22:53,366 --> 01:22:55,265
It's her peewee soccer
team thing. It's...

1478
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,960
We need to go somewhere
to discuss this.

1479
01:22:57,072 --> 01:22:58,971
-Discuss what?
-We are going to regroup.

1480
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:00,289
We are going to
go back in there.

1481
01:23:00,372 --> 01:23:01,527
He turned my shield into a taco.

1482
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:03,373
Oh, my God! Stop.

1483
01:23:05,113 --> 01:23:08,275
There is no "us."
There is no "we."

1484
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:10,315
Bob changed into that thing,

1485
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:12,785
and there's nothing any
of you can do about it.

1486
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:14,419
And what did you do exactly?

1487
01:23:14,554 --> 01:23:16,594
'Cause I seem to remember
you getting your arse beat

1488
01:23:16,692 --> 01:23:17,692
way worse than mine.

1489
01:23:17,785 --> 01:23:20,593
Yeah. Yeah. I
suck. I'm terrible.

1490
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:22,426
We're all terrible.

1491
01:23:22,562 --> 01:23:25,527
Ava, you're not a hero.
You're not even a good person.

1492
01:23:26,061 --> 01:23:26,862
Bitch.

1493
01:23:26,998 --> 01:23:28,163
See?

1494
01:23:28,299 --> 01:23:29,430
Slow down.<i> Um-nichka</i>.

1495
01:23:29,566 --> 01:23:31,335
Alexei, I am not your<i> um-nichka</i>.

1496
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:34,070
I haven't heard from you
or seen you in a year.

1497
01:23:34,206 --> 01:23:35,568
Okay, go easy on him.

1498
01:23:35,704 --> 01:23:37,705
-Oh, so you're nice now?
-Is it my turn?

1499
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,810
No, you know you're a
piece of trash, Walker.

1500
01:23:39,946 --> 01:23:40,875
So does your family.

1501
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:42,412
Jesus.

1502
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:45,184
We're all losers.

1503
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:48,352
And we lost.

1504
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:56,525
Yelena!

1505
01:23:58,365 --> 01:24:00,866
It... It needs to be
more of a collaboration.

1506
01:24:01,001 --> 01:24:02,433
Like, the hair, for example.

1507
01:24:02,568 --> 01:24:04,533
Maybe... Maybe I should
have had more of a say.

1508
01:24:04,668 --> 01:24:06,705
Don't let those idiots
get in your head.

1509
01:24:06,841 --> 01:24:08,403
The blond is great.

1510
01:24:08,539 --> 01:24:10,033
You sure? 'Cause,
I don't know,

1511
01:24:10,168 --> 01:24:11,697
I thought I liked it.
Now I'm not so sure.

1512
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:12,979
Enough about the hair.

1513
01:24:13,115 --> 01:24:14,396
Well, it's not just
about the hair.

1514
01:24:14,479 --> 01:24:15,959
Well, you keep talking
about the hair.

1515
01:24:16,044 --> 01:24:19,717
No, it's everything. My
suit. My name. My missions.

1516
01:24:19,852 --> 01:24:21,088
I mean...

1517
01:24:22,117 --> 01:24:23,520
why...

1518
01:24:23,655 --> 01:24:28,051
why would a god take
orders from anyone at all?

1519
01:24:28,187 --> 01:24:30,289
I think you're throwing
around the word "god"

1520
01:24:30,425 --> 01:24:31,892
a bit loosely there.

1521
01:24:32,028 --> 01:24:34,662
No, no. Because you said I
was all-powerful, invincible,

1522
01:24:34,798 --> 01:24:36,728
and stronger than a
whole team of Avengers,

1523
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:39,766
which includes at
least one god, so...

1524
01:24:43,274 --> 01:24:44,405
But I'm starting to think

1525
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:47,774
maybe you don't know what I am.

1526
01:24:48,914 --> 01:24:50,740
Oh, goddamn it.

1527
01:24:50,876 --> 01:24:52,515
Or what I'm capable of.

1528
01:24:54,453 --> 01:24:56,586
Maybe I need to show you.

1529
01:24:57,289 --> 01:25:00,985
This is so irritating.

1530
01:25:07,529 --> 01:25:09,433
You were gonna turn on me,

1531
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:12,569
just like the rest of them.

1532
01:25:13,272 --> 01:25:15,575
I'm not afraid of you, Robert.

1533
01:25:17,213 --> 01:25:20,004
It's not Robert you
need to be afraid of.

1534
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,619
Good girl.

1535
01:25:36,755 --> 01:25:38,462
You came to your senses.

1536
01:25:40,396 --> 01:25:42,092
Come here. Help me up.

1537
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:46,701
-I want a raise.
-Hmm.

1538
01:25:46,836 --> 01:25:48,255
Okay, fine.

1539
01:25:48,338 --> 01:25:49,504
Get cleanup on the body.

1540
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:51,273
And tell Holt it's finally time

1541
01:25:51,409 --> 01:25:53,279
to go lethal on these losers.

1542
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:11,165
Yelena!

1543
01:26:12,298 --> 01:26:13,457
-Little one.
-Go away.

1544
01:26:13,592 --> 01:26:14,362
No, I will not.

1545
01:26:14,498 --> 01:26:16,302
Well, then, chase me forever.

1546
01:26:16,437 --> 01:26:18,672
Fine, I will, because
that's what family does.

1547
01:26:18,807 --> 01:26:20,305
Oh, my God, stop.

1548
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,205
If you cared, you
would have called.

1549
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:24,211
I would have heard from you.

1550
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:29,975
I lost my sister
again, but forever.

1551
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,115
And you disappeared.

1552
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:35,981
I'm sorry.

1553
01:26:37,553 --> 01:26:39,391
I don't know how to do this.

1554
01:26:41,226 --> 01:26:42,691
I'm not good at it.

1555
01:26:45,331 --> 01:26:47,333
I didn't think you wanted me.

1556
01:26:51,596 --> 01:26:52,701
I did.

1557
01:26:55,139 --> 01:26:56,441
I see that.

1558
01:26:58,412 --> 01:27:02,040
I'm late, but
I'm... I'm here now.

1559
01:27:06,053 --> 01:27:08,046
Daddy, I'm so alone.

1560
01:27:10,257 --> 01:27:12,490
I don't have anything anymore.

1561
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:18,860
All I do is sit and
look at my phone

1562
01:27:18,995 --> 01:27:21,532
and think of all the terrible
things that I've done.

1563
01:27:21,667 --> 01:27:24,236
And then I go to work.
And then I drink.

1564
01:27:24,371 --> 01:27:26,464
And then I come home to no one.

1565
01:27:26,599 --> 01:27:27,870
And I sit

1566
01:27:28,005 --> 01:27:29,427
and I think about all the
terrible things I've done

1567
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:30,828
-again and again.
-Yelena, stop. Stop.

1568
01:27:30,911 --> 01:27:32,079
And I go crazy.

1569
01:27:32,214 --> 01:27:33,294
We all have things
that we regret.

1570
01:27:33,377 --> 01:27:35,172
No, but I have so many.

1571
01:27:37,383 --> 01:27:41,486
My first test at the Red Room.

1572
01:27:42,519 --> 01:27:44,322
Anya. She was just a child.

1573
01:27:44,458 --> 01:27:46,689
-She was so small.
-So were you.

1574
01:27:48,587 --> 01:27:49,858
I know.

1575
01:27:49,993 --> 01:27:53,531
I know there were dark
times. Very, very dark times.

1576
01:27:53,667 --> 01:27:57,727
But before, you were such
a special little girl.

1577
01:27:57,862 --> 01:27:59,372
Did you know this?

1578
01:28:01,267 --> 01:28:04,509
You walked into a room.
You made it brighter.

1579
01:28:05,310 --> 01:28:07,677
You felt a lot of joy.

1580
01:28:08,513 --> 01:28:11,609
I don't remember that feeling.

1581
01:28:11,744 --> 01:28:13,353
You were so kind.

1582
01:28:15,215 --> 01:28:17,122
Do you remember why
you want to be goalie

1583
01:28:17,258 --> 01:28:19,392
on your terrible soccer team?

1584
01:28:20,619 --> 01:28:21,658
I...

1585
01:28:22,659 --> 01:28:24,588
So I didn't have to run as much.

1586
01:28:24,723 --> 01:28:25,791
No.

1587
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:28,327
Maybe that too, but you told me,

1588
01:28:29,163 --> 01:28:32,300
"I want to be the one
everyone can rely on

1589
01:28:32,436 --> 01:28:34,737
if they make a mistake."

1590
01:28:35,902 --> 01:28:39,104
That Lena is still in you.

1591
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:41,711
I still see her.

1592
01:28:43,818 --> 01:28:45,244
I don't.

1593
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:48,279
You're stuck. You're alone.
You look only at the bad.

1594
01:28:48,414 --> 01:28:53,393
When I look at you, I
don't see your mistakes.

1595
01:28:55,494 --> 01:28:57,287
That's why we need each other.

1596
01:29:02,368 --> 01:29:04,195
Okay, that was really good.

1597
01:29:20,682 --> 01:29:21,617
-Val?
-Yeah?

1598
01:29:21,753 --> 01:29:23,181
It's cleanup from the penthouse,

1599
01:29:23,316 --> 01:29:26,250
and they're saying,
well, there's no body.

1600
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,186
What?

1601
01:29:43,535 --> 01:29:45,770
<i>I don't know what I'm
looking at up here.</i>

1602
01:29:45,906 --> 01:29:47,612
<i>It doesn't look good.</i>

1603
01:29:54,487 --> 01:29:56,522
Aren't you tired of fighting?

1604
01:29:57,618 --> 01:29:58,986
Let me help you.

1605
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:07,665
Holt, are you seeing this?

1606
01:30:08,101 --> 01:30:09,359
Is that...

1607
01:30:09,970 --> 01:30:11,295
Oh, no.

1608
01:31:00,813 --> 01:31:02,049
It's time.

1609
01:31:13,727 --> 01:31:15,095
Follow me!

1610
01:31:17,962 --> 01:31:20,467
Go, go! Go!

1611
01:31:25,804 --> 01:31:27,041
Dad!

1612
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:43,992
Come on. You've got
to... You've got to...

1613
01:33:02,671 --> 01:33:03,742
Mom?

1614
01:33:14,817 --> 01:33:16,656
You're safe, little one.

1615
01:33:26,862 --> 01:33:28,701
You all know the truth.

1616
01:33:36,269 --> 01:33:38,270
You can't outrun the emptiness.

1617
01:33:38,405 --> 01:33:41,343
I think Bob's dark
side got superpowers.

1618
01:33:41,479 --> 01:33:43,568
-Get everybody off the street.
-Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1619
01:33:43,651 --> 01:33:45,241
Come on! Come on!
Go, go, go, go!

1620
01:33:45,376 --> 01:33:48,182
Everybody! Come on! Come on!

1621
01:33:53,662 --> 01:33:55,394
-Go, go, go!
-Go, go! Inside, inside!

1622
01:33:55,530 --> 01:33:56,856
Go, everyone, inside!

1623
01:33:56,992 --> 01:33:59,226
Let's go! Get in. Get in.

1624
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:02,064
Yelena!

1625
01:34:02,199 --> 01:34:04,429
-Come on.
-Go, go, go!

1626
01:34:17,012 --> 01:34:18,718
Yelena, what are you doing?

1627
01:34:22,324 --> 01:34:23,756
It's what you said.

1628
01:34:24,687 --> 01:34:26,022
We're all alone.

1629
01:34:26,953 --> 01:34:28,222
All of us.

1630
01:34:29,561 --> 01:34:30,622
Wait!

1631
01:34:30,758 --> 01:34:32,226
Yelena!

1632
01:34:42,978 --> 01:34:47,639
-No, no, no! No! No, no!
-Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

1633
01:35:10,105 --> 01:35:11,463
Yelena!

1634
01:35:15,243 --> 01:35:17,238
<font color="#ffff54">Yelena, c'mon!</font>

1635
01:35:20,809 --> 01:35:23,079
<font color="#ffff54">Lunch will be over soon.</font>

1636
01:35:23,845 --> 01:35:25,719
<font color="#ffff54">Why'd you bring us so far out?</font>

1637
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:32,286
<font color="#ffff54">Anya, over here!</font>

1638
01:35:35,923 --> 01:35:37,258
<font color="#ffff54">I'm sorry.</font>

1639
01:35:37,858 --> 01:35:39,161
Bob!

1640
01:35:54,248 --> 01:35:55,573
Yelena!

1641
01:36:03,682 --> 01:36:05,785
No. No.

1642
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,486
No, no, no!

1643
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:10,555
No! No, no, no! No!

1644
01:36:12,157 --> 01:36:15,098
<font color="#ffff54">It's too late
for that, friend.</font>

1645
01:36:20,573 --> 01:36:21,698
Yelena!

1646
01:36:24,839 --> 01:36:25,839
Bob!

1647
01:37:00,574 --> 01:37:03,509
Bob! We don't have
time for this.

1648
01:37:06,452 --> 01:37:07,480
Stop.

1649
01:37:33,074 --> 01:37:34,573
There you are.

1650
01:38:23,855 --> 01:38:27,030
-I'm going after her.
-And then what?

1651
01:38:27,166 --> 01:38:28,931
If she did that, she
did it for a reason.

1652
01:38:29,067 --> 01:38:31,033
Well, what if she's dead, huh?

1653
01:38:31,168 --> 01:38:32,565
What if there's no coming back?

1654
01:38:33,365 --> 01:38:34,298
What if she isn't?

1655
01:38:34,433 --> 01:38:35,332
How do you know that?

1656
01:38:35,468 --> 01:38:36,534
No, no, no, wait, hold on.

1657
01:38:36,670 --> 01:38:38,342
I think she might have a point.

1658
01:38:38,478 --> 01:38:40,593
When... When I was back in
the vault, I-I saw something.

1659
01:38:40,676 --> 01:38:43,114
I-I went somewhere. I
can't explain it, but...

1660
01:38:44,552 --> 01:38:45,677
What did you see?

1661
01:38:51,558 --> 01:38:53,223
Enough, Bob.

1662
01:38:55,924 --> 01:38:57,161
Enough.

1663
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,723
Yelena?

1664
01:39:04,768 --> 01:39:06,071
Hi.

1665
01:39:06,770 --> 01:39:08,007
Hey.

1666
01:39:09,370 --> 01:39:11,505
I just want to talk, okay?

1667
01:39:13,206 --> 01:39:14,541
About what?

1668
01:39:17,647 --> 01:39:20,448
About the stuff we spoke
about in the vault.

1669
01:39:31,729 --> 01:39:32,757
Hi.

1670
01:39:33,963 --> 01:39:35,334
What's up?

1671
01:39:35,469 --> 01:39:36,563
Um...

1672
01:39:37,833 --> 01:39:41,502
Not much. You know, just
watching New York disappear

1673
01:39:41,637 --> 01:39:45,639
into a big maze of
interconnected shame rooms.

1674
01:39:45,774 --> 01:39:49,114
You ever seen anything
crazy like that before?

1675
01:39:50,117 --> 01:39:52,177
I... I don't know what
you want me to say.

1676
01:39:52,312 --> 01:39:53,613
That you'll stop.

1677
01:39:54,249 --> 01:39:56,187
Oh, it's not "me" me.

1678
01:39:57,087 --> 01:39:59,190
It's-It's-It's "It."

1679
01:40:01,826 --> 01:40:03,260
The Void.

1680
01:40:04,495 --> 01:40:07,297
I... I have these
good days, you know?

1681
01:40:08,266 --> 01:40:11,399
Where I feel... I
feel invincible.

1682
01:40:11,534 --> 01:40:15,104
But then there are
a lot of bad days

1683
01:40:15,239 --> 01:40:17,571
when I remember that nothing...

1684
01:40:19,275 --> 01:40:21,641
nothing matters, you know?

1685
01:40:23,384 --> 01:40:26,083
So you're just gonna sit
here and let it take over?

1686
01:40:26,219 --> 01:40:28,450
Well, there's no
use in fighting it.

1687
01:40:29,286 --> 01:40:31,189
At least I found a nice room.

1688
01:40:32,421 --> 01:40:34,687
The other rooms are much worse.

1689
01:40:36,361 --> 01:40:38,460
It is nice and quiet here, yeah.

1690
01:40:38,595 --> 01:40:40,282
What was that?

1691
01:40:40,365 --> 01:40:41,614
Disrespected in my own house!

1692
01:40:41,697 --> 01:40:43,257
Don't mind them.

1693
01:40:43,366 --> 01:40:44,764
It'll be over soon.

1694
01:40:44,899 --> 01:40:46,487
Say it again! Say
it again, Annie!

1695
01:40:46,570 --> 01:40:48,155
I... I shouldn't
have. I'm sorry.

1696
01:40:48,238 --> 01:40:49,370
Don't touch her.

1697
01:40:49,506 --> 01:40:50,622
Big man speaks up.

1698
01:40:50,705 --> 01:40:52,811
-Bob, shut your mouth.
-Mom, no.

1699
01:40:52,947 --> 01:40:54,210
My son, the hero. Look at you.

1700
01:40:54,346 --> 01:40:55,831
-What are you gonna do?
-Bob. Sit down.

1701
01:40:55,914 --> 01:40:57,115
You a hero, Bobby?

1702
01:40:57,251 --> 01:40:59,679
Sit down. You're
making it worse.

1703
01:41:00,778 --> 01:41:02,517
You always made it worse.

1704
01:41:06,022 --> 01:41:07,390
I'm sorry.

1705
01:41:08,586 --> 01:41:09,722
No, it's fine.

1706
01:41:37,225 --> 01:41:40,324
What I said to you
before was wrong, Bob.

1707
01:41:40,927 --> 01:41:42,425
You can't stuff it down.

1708
01:41:43,691 --> 01:41:46,462
You can't hold it in all alone.

1709
01:41:47,195 --> 01:41:48,497
No one can.

1710
01:41:50,332 --> 01:41:51,464
We have to let it out.

1711
01:41:51,599 --> 01:41:53,370
We have to spend time together.

1712
01:41:55,409 --> 01:41:57,637
And even if it doesn't
make the emptiness go away,

1713
01:41:57,772 --> 01:42:00,575
I promise you it
will feel lighter.

1714
01:42:02,815 --> 01:42:04,513
How do you know?

1715
01:42:08,418 --> 01:42:10,981
Because it already has for me.

1716
01:42:14,724 --> 01:42:17,559
We can find a way
out of here together.

1717
01:42:19,299 --> 01:42:21,464
Will you try and
leave here with me?

1718
01:42:28,609 --> 01:42:29,542
Okay.

1719
01:42:29,677 --> 01:42:30,704
Look out!

1720
01:42:46,993 --> 01:42:48,557
Who's doing this, Bob?

1721
01:42:51,733 --> 01:42:53,166
I think I am.

1722
01:43:00,669 --> 01:43:02,673
Just try to get
used to it, okay?

1723
01:43:03,576 --> 01:43:07,070
There's no death here.
The pain only gets worse.

1724
01:43:20,651 --> 01:43:22,019
Evil pillow!

1725
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,158
Lena.

1726
01:43:32,564 --> 01:43:34,240
You came for us.

1727
01:43:35,705 --> 01:43:37,742
What did you see?
Are you okay?

1728
01:43:37,878 --> 01:43:39,135
Oh, I'm fine.

1729
01:43:39,270 --> 01:43:40,979
I have a great past,
so I'm totally fine.

1730
01:43:41,115 --> 01:43:43,012
Yeah, this place is messed up.

1731
01:43:43,148 --> 01:43:44,712
We're here together.

1732
01:43:45,315 --> 01:43:46,648
That's what matters.

1733
01:43:48,780 --> 01:43:51,690
Thank you, guys. Really.

1734
01:43:51,825 --> 01:43:53,183
Of course.

1735
01:43:53,318 --> 01:43:55,628
Here we are, Shane's Elite
Electronic Thunderbolts.

1736
01:43:55,763 --> 01:43:57,054
It's not Shane.

1737
01:43:57,189 --> 01:43:59,760
Okay, okay. Just how-how
do we get out of here?

1738
01:44:03,967 --> 01:44:08,605
I mean, as... as far as I
know, it's just endless rooms.

1739
01:44:09,842 --> 01:44:11,724
Wait, you said that this was
the nicest room you found

1740
01:44:11,807 --> 01:44:13,909
and the others are
way worse, right?

1741
01:44:14,044 --> 01:44:15,974
Yeah.

1742
01:44:16,909 --> 01:44:19,483
Okay, well, show us the worst.

1743
01:44:43,202 --> 01:44:45,038
Where do you think
you're going, Robert?

1744
01:44:46,971 --> 01:44:48,480
Well, he seems nice.

1745
01:44:48,616 --> 01:44:51,381
The strangest mission
I've ever been part of.

1746
01:44:51,517 --> 01:44:52,980
-This way!
-Go, go, go!

1747
01:44:53,116 --> 01:44:54,749
Come on!

1748
01:45:02,994 --> 01:45:04,088
Oh, no.

1749
01:45:08,294 --> 01:45:11,031
Bob, you hit me with that
sign one more time...

1750
01:45:12,170 --> 01:45:13,264
I was on meth!

1751
01:45:17,009 --> 01:45:18,141
This way!

1752
01:45:18,276 --> 01:45:20,478
Come on. Come on. Go.

1753
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:35,625
I've been here before.

1754
01:45:36,757 --> 01:45:38,664
This is where it started.

1755
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:42,564
I was roaming around
Southeast Asia,

1756
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:44,102
thought I'd figure
something out,

1757
01:45:44,237 --> 01:45:46,372
or at least find more drugs.

1758
01:45:48,306 --> 01:45:50,135
Then there was this guy,

1759
01:45:50,270 --> 01:45:55,072
started talking to me
about a... a medical study.

1760
01:45:55,208 --> 01:45:58,043
A trial drug that
could make me stronger.

1761
01:45:59,053 --> 01:46:01,046
Felt like a miracle.

1762
01:46:02,755 --> 01:46:06,392
I'd finally get to show
everyone that I was more.

1763
01:46:07,885 --> 01:46:09,120
That I was...

1764
01:46:11,096 --> 01:46:12,497
something.

1765
01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:16,259
And look what you unleashed.

1766
01:46:21,067 --> 01:46:23,673
The most shameful
thing of all was

1767
01:46:23,808 --> 01:46:26,577
thinking you could
be anything more than

1768
01:46:27,738 --> 01:46:28,777
nothing.

1769
01:46:30,644 --> 01:46:31,714
We're leaving.

1770
01:46:38,518 --> 01:46:39,689
No.

1771
01:46:57,438 --> 01:46:58,703
Stop.

1772
01:46:58,839 --> 01:47:01,413
Just... let... let them go.

1773
01:47:01,548 --> 01:47:05,242
Wait. You think
they care about you?

1774
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:08,487
You don't matter.

1775
01:47:09,121 --> 01:47:10,746
To anyone.

1776
01:47:10,881 --> 01:47:11,954
That's not true.

1777
01:47:13,719 --> 01:47:15,454
No!

1778
01:47:15,589 --> 01:47:16,627
Don't hurt her.

1779
01:47:18,593 --> 01:47:20,224
Robert, the hero.

1780
01:47:29,033 --> 01:47:30,641
I'm stronger than you.

1781
01:47:32,573 --> 01:47:34,007
Let's see.

1782
01:47:45,554 --> 01:47:47,053
Get up, Bobby.

1783
01:47:47,188 --> 01:47:50,254
You thought you were
gonna be some great man?

1784
01:47:50,998 --> 01:47:52,630
Some savior?

1785
01:47:53,928 --> 01:47:55,699
You can't even save yourself.

1786
01:48:03,738 --> 01:48:08,140
We will always be alone.

1787
01:48:49,223 --> 01:48:50,650
Is that all you've got?

1788
01:49:06,833 --> 01:49:08,233
This isn't right.

1789
01:49:09,736 --> 01:49:11,271
Bob, stop!

1790
01:49:11,773 --> 01:49:13,502
This is what he wants!

1791
01:49:50,414 --> 01:49:51,441
I'm here.

1792
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:56,688
It will always be just us.

1793
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:10,559
I'm here. You are not alone.

1794
01:50:18,606 --> 01:50:20,008
Come on.

1795
01:51:20,032 --> 01:51:21,300
Sweetie.

1796
01:51:36,249 --> 01:51:37,782
You were great in there, Bob.

1797
01:51:39,754 --> 01:51:40,926
Thanks, Walker.

1798
01:51:41,696 --> 01:51:43,619
Hey, wait, in where?

1799
01:51:45,528 --> 01:51:46,732
Whoa.

1800
01:51:47,401 --> 01:51:49,429
What happened here?

1801
01:51:49,564 --> 01:51:52,232
Sorry, I'm... I'm just a
little... I'm a little fuzzy.

1802
01:51:54,232 --> 01:51:56,601
Okay. Are you serious?

1803
01:51:56,970 --> 01:51:58,205
Are you okay?

1804
01:52:00,247 --> 01:52:02,044
Yeah, I'm fine.

1805
01:52:04,885 --> 01:52:08,481
Yes. I need an
extraction right now.

1806
01:52:09,117 --> 01:52:10,947
What? No. I don't have backup.

1807
01:52:11,082 --> 01:52:12,615
I need help.

1808
01:52:13,561 --> 01:52:15,021
I'm going to kill that person.

1809
01:52:15,157 --> 01:52:16,397
Okay. Wait, wait,
wait. Hold on.

1810
01:52:16,490 --> 01:52:18,392
What happens when he
regains his memory?

1811
01:52:19,028 --> 01:52:21,292
-Okay. Come on.
-Oh, me too?

1812
01:52:21,428 --> 01:52:24,136
Yep. We stick
together from now on.

1813
01:52:24,271 --> 01:52:25,637
That's nice.

1814
01:52:25,773 --> 01:52:27,213
Can't kill her. We
gotta take her in.

1815
01:52:27,340 --> 01:52:28,698
Can't kill her.

1816
01:52:28,833 --> 01:52:32,938
Maybe when we take her
in, I break a few bones.

1817
01:52:33,074 --> 01:52:34,306
Oh, I'd like to kill her.

1818
01:52:34,442 --> 01:52:35,962
Maybe when he does
get his memory back,

1819
01:52:36,078 --> 01:52:37,439
he can fix this stupid thing.

1820
01:52:37,574 --> 01:52:38,763
At least let me break her legs.

1821
01:52:38,846 --> 01:52:39,780
Okay, guys.

1822
01:52:39,915 --> 01:52:41,381
Then you can drag her.

1823
01:52:41,516 --> 01:52:43,002
I know we're all having a
lot of feelings right now.

1824
01:52:43,085 --> 01:52:44,720
-I am too. I get it.
-Hi.

1825
01:52:44,856 --> 01:52:46,682
Give me half... half a second.

1826
01:52:51,298 --> 01:52:53,359
Are we live?

1827
01:52:53,728 --> 01:52:54,897
Great.

1828
01:52:55,033 --> 01:52:57,097
For years, I have
been working secretly

1829
01:52:57,233 --> 01:52:59,795
to develop a new
age of protection.

1830
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:02,966
Today, the citizens of
the United States needed

1831
01:53:03,101 --> 01:53:04,370
that protection.

1832
01:53:04,505 --> 01:53:08,341
And thanks to my hard
work, they got it.

1833
01:53:08,944 --> 01:53:10,211
Ladies and gentlemen...

1834
01:53:11,185 --> 01:53:12,746
meet...

1835
01:53:12,881 --> 01:53:15,552
the new Avengers.

1836
01:53:40,677 --> 01:53:42,243
We own you now.

1837
01:55:57,146 --> 01:55:59,714
Wow, so many choices, huh?

1838
01:55:59,849 --> 01:56:00,914
Hard to decide.

1839
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:02,216
Oh, look, Wheaties. Wow.

1840
01:56:02,351 --> 01:56:04,952
With its toasted
wholewheat flakes,

1841
01:56:05,087 --> 01:56:06,551
wholegrain, vitamins.

1842
01:56:06,686 --> 01:56:09,559
Give you energy.
Good for kids, huh?

1843
01:56:09,694 --> 01:56:11,425
Okay.

1844
01:56:17,129 --> 01:56:18,366
Thanks.

1845
01:56:19,033 --> 01:56:20,335
You're welcome.

1846
01:56:24,205 --> 01:56:25,572

The government said so.

1871
02:03:33,331 --> 02:03:36,140
How does Sam Wilson
not understand that?

1872
02:03:36,276 --> 02:03:37,641
Well, he does have the shield.

1873
02:03:37,776 --> 02:03:39,453
-Well, I got a shield too.
-It's not a shield.

1874
02:03:39,536 --> 02:03:41,343
-Yeah, it is a shield.
-It's a shitty shield.

1875
02:03:41,478 --> 02:03:42,643
It's a great shield, Bucky.

1876
02:03:42,779 --> 02:03:45,373
Okay, if he puts
together a team,

1877
02:03:45,508 --> 02:03:48,052
and then the team is
called the Avengers,

1878
02:03:48,188 --> 02:03:49,643
who are the real Avengers?

1879
02:03:49,779 --> 02:03:51,532
Well, that's the question
the Internet has been asking,

1880
02:03:51,615 --> 02:03:54,389
and judging by the very
nasty memes that I've read,

1881
02:03:54,525 --> 02:03:56,151
they don't think that it's us.

1882
02:03:56,286 --> 02:03:57,092
Weren't you going
to talk to him?

1883
02:03:57,228 --> 02:03:58,293
I already did.

1884
02:03:58,429 --> 02:04:00,223
-And?
-It went poorly.

1885
02:04:00,358 --> 02:04:02,160
I don't know what any
of these buttons do.

1886
02:04:02,295 --> 02:04:04,135
It's unbelievable they
didn't mark any of them.

1887
02:04:04,231 --> 02:04:06,304
You know he's filed for
copyright of the name?

1888
02:04:06,439 --> 02:04:08,999
-Did he?
-We're losing credibility.

1889
02:04:09,135 --> 02:04:10,626
Which we had very
little to begin with.

1890
02:04:10,709 --> 02:04:12,838
And now there's this
huge space crisis,

1891
02:04:12,973 --> 02:04:14,371
and no one's
telling us about it.

1892
02:04:14,506 --> 02:04:16,265
We're running out of space
already? It's impossible.

1893
02:04:16,348 --> 02:04:19,110
This building is enormous.

1894
02:04:20,550 --> 02:04:22,854
-What?
-Outer space.

1895
02:04:22,989 --> 02:04:24,315
Outer space.

1896
02:04:25,285 --> 02:04:27,620
Run a threat analysis.
I want a full report.

1897
02:04:27,755 --> 02:04:29,626
<i>Running threat analysis.</i>

1898
02:04:30,095 --> 02:04:31,562
Hello, team.

1899
02:04:32,597 --> 02:04:33,810
The hell are you wearing?

1900
02:04:33,893 --> 02:04:35,158
I heard about Sam Wilson.

1901
02:04:35,294 --> 02:04:37,632
He's dumb, litigious
man, but I am smart.

1902
02:04:37,768 --> 02:04:40,839
I am smart man. I
have smart solve.

1903
02:04:40,974 --> 02:04:45,371
Avengerz.

1904
02:04:45,506 --> 02:04:46,506
Avengerz.

1905
02:04:46,612 --> 02:04:48,673
With a 'Z, ' there
is no copyright.

1906
02:04:48,809 --> 02:04:50,478
-No.
-So soft too.

1907
02:04:50,614 --> 02:04:54,451
Feel like bottom of baby seal.

1908
02:04:54,586 --> 02:04:58,083
You want to... you
want to savor that?

1909
02:04:58,218 --> 02:05:00,051
I don't want to touch
your baby seal butt.

1910
02:05:00,187 --> 02:05:01,920
-I have one for you.
-I don't want it.

1911
02:05:02,055 --> 02:05:03,928
I have one for
you. I got you one.

1912
02:05:04,064 --> 02:05:05,255
I got you one.

1913
02:05:05,390 --> 02:05:07,990
And for you, Bob, in
the corner hiding,

1914
02:05:08,125 --> 02:05:09,732
pretending to read the book.

1915
02:05:09,867 --> 02:05:15,397
We're all matching.
All part of super team!

1916
02:05:16,632 --> 02:05:18,376
<i>Unidentified craft
entering orbit.</i>

1917
02:05:18,512 --> 02:05:20,742
You should get a
satellite image.

1918
02:05:20,878 --> 02:05:23,638
-Uh. Get a satellite image.
-And fire up...

1919
02:05:23,774 --> 02:05:25,667
And fire... I was gonna say
that. And fire up the jets.

1920
02:05:25,750 --> 02:05:27,308
We wouldn't need
to fire up the jets

1921
02:05:27,444 --> 02:05:30,144
if we had a Sentry
who could fly.

1922
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:32,856
I know... Sorry. Sorry, guys.

1923
02:05:32,992 --> 02:05:38,453
Can't be the Sentry without
the, you know, other side.

1924
02:05:39,265 --> 02:05:40,721
I did the dishes though.

1925
02:05:40,857 --> 02:05:44,864
And what are we gonna do,
just ride Bob into the sky?

1926
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,566
Yes. Can you
imagine Red Guardian

1927
02:05:47,702 --> 02:05:49,338
riding on top of Sentry,
