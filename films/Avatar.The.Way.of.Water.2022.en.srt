You were parked down the street, man.

If they didn't see you, then they didn't see you.

00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:50,338
You're paranoid. Turn around.

Bro, I know it, man. They're on me.

No, no, man. No.

160
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:29,192
No one followed us, dude. You're being paranoid.

161
00:10:29,216 --> 00:10:30,917
Fuck, fuck. Listen to me, man.

See if they follow you and call me back.

165

00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:23,303
But you a play ah though, right?

174
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,707
I mean, only playahs got two phones.

175
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:29,811
How old are you?

176
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:31,813
Twenty-one.

177
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:33,146
Twenty-one, my ass.

178
00:11:38,718 --> 00:11:39,718
They following you?

179
00:11:39,753 --> 00:11:40,687
They turned off somewhere.

180
00:11:40,755 --> 00:11:42,389
Oh, good.

181
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:43,623
Good.

182
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,001
Fuck, Freddy, I can't do this shit.

183
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:46,226
Man, I can't pick you up, man.

184
00:11:46,293 --> 00:11:47,727
- What? - It's fucked, man.

185
00:11:47,795 --> 00:11:49,205
It wasn't supposed to go down this way, man.

186
00:11:49,229 --> 00:11:51,565
J.J., shut the...

187
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:52,966
shut the fuck up.

188
00:11:53,033 --> 00:11:55,101
Meet me at the Lake City bus station, goddammit.

189
00:11:55,168 --> 00:11:56,168
All right?

190
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:00,942
Freddy, goddammit.

191
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:02,242
What's the point without Mac?

192
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:05,111
Mac is fucking dead, man.

193
00:12:05,178 --> 00:12:06,379
It's just me and you.

194
00:12:06,446 --> 00:12:08,783
We good?

195
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,217
Yeah, good, man.

196
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:12,085
Don't answer the phone from nobody.

197
00:12:12,152 --> 00:12:13,420
Don't fuckin' stop.

198
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:15,555
Just get to the station, all right?

199
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,159
All right, man. I'm chill.

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,095
I got you.

201
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:24,431
All right. Fuck.

202
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,326
Freddy?

203
00:13:26,393 --> 00:13:30,463
No, J.J. He's on the 95 downtown.

204
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:34,869
Get him and bring him here.

205
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:35,937
Okay.

206
00:13:57,457 --> 00:13:59,459
You piss yourself or something?

207
00:14:02,595 --> 00:14:03,662
I call my boo?

208
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:05,331
I'm not giving you my fucking phone.

209
00:14:05,397 --> 00:14:08,300
- Fuck! - Hey! You mind?

210
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:11,136
I'm trying to get some shut-eye here.

211
00:14:11,203 --> 00:14:12,504
I'm sorry.

212
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:16,414
See, you're pissing everybody off.

213
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:18,320
Stop asking me for my phone. I'm not giving it to you.

214
00:14:18,344 --> 00:14:20,679
It's an emergency.

215
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:22,748
Mm. You know what?

216
00:14:26,118 --> 00:14:27,486
Make it quick.

217
00:14:37,363 --> 00:14:39,698
Pick up. Pick up. Pick up.

218
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:43,036
Hi, S... Smokie.

219
00:14:43,103 --> 00:14:46,438
Yeah. Hi. No, I just...

220
00:14:46,505 --> 00:14:48,207
I had... had to borrow one.

221
00:14:50,043 --> 00:14:52,846
No. I... I told... I told you mine was... mine...

222
00:14:52,912 --> 00:14:54,380
Mine was tapped out.

223
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:58,717
Just some guy.

224
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:06,026
No, no!

225
00:15:06,092 --> 00:15:07,226
He's not my friend.

226
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:08,828
Just.

227
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:12,932
Just... just... just.

228
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:18,270
No.

229
00:15:18,337 --> 00:15:19,638
Of course not.

230
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,275
I had to.

231
00:15:23,342 --> 00:15:25,544
I'm coming.

232
00:15:27,113 --> 00:15:28,747
I'm gonna be safe.

233
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,550
Mm-hm.

234
00:15:33,086 --> 00:15:36,321
Okay. Yeah, I'm alone.

235
00:15:36,388 --> 00:15:37,824
Yeah. I'm alone.

236
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:40,927
Mm-hm.

237
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:43,562
Yeah.

238
00:15:47,332 --> 00:15:48,835
Mm-hm.

239
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:10,824
You are fucked up.

240
00:16:36,648 --> 00:16:40,252
Mm-hm. No one.

241
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:42,287
No. It's me.

242
00:16:42,354 --> 00:16:44,389
No one knows.

243
00:16:44,456 --> 00:16:46,625
No one knows, okay?

244
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:49,394
Yeah.

245
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:52,264
Phone.

246
00:16:52,331 --> 00:16:54,100
I gotta go. I gotta go.

247
00:16:55,802 --> 00:16:56,936
Phone.

248
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,677
Where you going?

249
00:17:08,948 --> 00:17:10,549
What?

250
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:14,520
You said, "No one knows."

251
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:17,757
No one knows what?

252
00:17:19,225 --> 00:17:20,726
Fuck you care?

253
00:17:20,794 --> 00:17:23,662
You ever meet this guy before?

254
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:25,765
Why you in my business?

255
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:30,036
How old are you?

256
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:31,336
Really.

257
00:17:34,007 --> 00:17:35,975
I'm 17.

258
00:17:40,914 --> 00:17:42,414
Hm.

259
00:17:58,998 --> 00:18:00,200
Fuck you, man.

260
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,846
Pick up. Pick up.

261
00:18:12,912 --> 00:18:14,948
J.J., where the fuck are you, man?

262
00:18:15,014 --> 00:18:16,615
I'm right behind you.

263
00:18:16,682 --> 00:18:18,584
I don't see you. Hurry the fuck up!

264
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,171
I said I'll meet you at Lake City, man.

265
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,055
Get the fuck out the road.

266
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:23,289
I'm passing you now.

267
00:18:23,355 --> 00:18:24,991
Get to move. Move!

268
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,962
Fuck, yeah.

269
00:19:24,216 --> 00:19:27,252
Freddy, I'm almost at Lake City, bro.

270
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:29,587
Hey, remember that guy that patched up Reggie

271
00:19:29,654 --> 00:19:31,890
after he got shot by the cop?

272
00:19:31,957 --> 00:19:33,125
The vet?

273
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:34,568
- The what? - The dog guy, man.

274
00:19:34,592 --> 00:19:35,660
The veterinarian.

275
00:19:35,726 --> 00:19:37,229
You know where he's at?

276
00:19:37,296 --> 00:19:38,337
No. I'll have to call Reg.

277
00:19:38,397 --> 00:19:39,398
Why?

278
00:19:39,463 --> 00:19:40,731
You're gonna have to take me

279
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,043
to go see him after you pick me up.

280
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:43,434
Yo, did you get shot?

281
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:44,803
It's just a scratch.

282
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,238
Then why you going to a vet?

283
00:19:46,305 --> 00:19:48,273
If it was serious, I'd go to the hospital.

284
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,817
Fuck you! But then you'd go to jail!

285
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:51,742
Just find the fucking number, J.J.

286
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,811
Fuck!

287
00:19:52,878 --> 00:19:54,179
All right. All right. All right.

288
00:19:54,246 --> 00:19:55,579
I'll call Reggie now.

289
00:20:01,887 --> 00:20:02,955
Fuck.

290
00:20:22,473 --> 00:20:24,518
Lake City, Florida coming up.

291
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:26,744
Anybody for Lake City, Florida?

292
00:20:31,515 --> 00:20:32,784
Yo.

293
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:35,720
Yo.

294
00:20:46,131 --> 00:20:47,631
What's his name?

295
00:20:47,698 --> 00:20:49,633
The dude you're going to meet.

296
00:20:52,204 --> 00:20:53,738
Smokie.

297
00:20:55,207 --> 00:20:56,842
What's his real name?

298
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,914
You don't know his real name?

299
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:08,754
You know what he looks like?

300
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:12,357
Now answer this question honestly.

301
00:21:12,424 --> 00:21:14,426
How old are you?

302
00:21:14,493 --> 00:21:18,263
Why do you keep asking me that?

303
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,531
Does he know how old you are?

304
00:21:20,598 --> 00:21:22,067
Smokie?

305
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:25,337
What'd you tell him?

306
00:21:25,404 --> 00:21:28,106
Twenty-one?

307
00:21:28,173 --> 00:21:30,409
He knows how old I am.

308
00:21:42,686 --> 00:21:44,688
Your parents know where you are?

309
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,895
Freddy? I'm here, man.

310
00:22:23,962 --> 00:22:26,531
I got that vet's number. What bus are you on?

311
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:29,468
I just pulled up. Hold tight.

312
00:22:29,534 --> 00:22:30,701
All right.

313
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,680
Lake City, folks.

314
00:22:33,704 --> 00:22:34,906
Anyone for Lake City?

315
00:22:41,645 --> 00:22:42,645
Take care of yourself.

316
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,615
Like you give a shit.

317
00:22:51,323 --> 00:22:52,656
Move, dumb-ass.

318
00:22:52,723 --> 00:22:54,092
Dumbass.

319
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,760
Fuckers.

320
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,104
Fuck.

321
00:23:10,442 --> 00:23:12,177
Son of a bitch.

322
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,049
On or off?

323
00:23:53,818 --> 00:23:55,120
On or off?

324
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:02,060
You sick or something?

325
00:24:03,895 --> 00:24:05,764
Like you give a shit.

326
00:24:38,195 --> 00:24:40,730
Next stop's gonna be Valdosta.

327
00:24:41,865 --> 00:24:43,434
Where is he?

328
00:24:58,382 --> 00:24:59,583
Where's Freddy, J.J.?

329
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,650
I haven't see him.

330
00:25:00,684 --> 00:25:01,684
Lie! It's a lie.

331
00:25:04,555 --> 00:25:06,257
Call Coco.

332
00:25:10,661 --> 00:25:11,661
We got J.J.

333
00:25:11,695 --> 00:25:13,530
Good. Hurry up then.

334
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:15,799
In Lake City.

335
00:25:18,535 --> 00:25:19,670
Hm.

336
00:25:43,594 --> 00:25:46,330
Next stop, Valdosta.

337
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:47,431
Valdosta.

338
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:29,573
Who is it?

339
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,108
It's Freddy.

340
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:34,912
You still in Valdosta?

341
00:26:34,978 --> 00:26:36,146
Yeah.

342
00:26:36,213 --> 00:26:37,915
So what?

343
00:26:37,981 --> 00:26:39,116
I need some help.

344
00:26:40,751 --> 00:26:42,019
I'm busy.

345
00:26:47,124 --> 00:26:48,827
I just need a ride somewhere, man.

346
00:26:48,892 --> 00:26:50,861
Get a cab.

347
00:26:50,928 --> 00:26:52,730
I can't do that.

348
00:26:52,797 --> 00:26:56,100
Why not?

349
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:01,205
Because I'm in trouble.

350
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:04,608
Please.

351
00:27:06,377 --> 00:27:07,378
Please who?

352
00:27:07,444 --> 00:27:08,579
What?

353
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:10,481
Please who?

354
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:12,082
Just say it.

355
00:27:13,384 --> 00:27:14,384
Fuck you, I...

356
00:27:33,537 --> 00:27:35,038
Damn.

357
00:27:35,973 --> 00:27:37,508
You are fucked up.

358
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:46,150
Fuck.

359
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:06,069
Stop. Fucking. Calling. Me.

360
00:28:06,136 --> 00:28:07,638
Chrissy, I got money.

361
00:28:07,704 --> 00:28:09,039
Jesus.

362
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:11,375
It's for Lily. Please.

363
00:28:11,442 --> 00:28:12,719
Hah. You missed 13 years of payments,

364
00:28:12,743 --> 00:28:15,179
you wanna be a daddy now?

365
00:28:15,245 --> 00:28:16,723
I can pay it all back right now.

366
00:28:16,747 --> 00:28:18,549
So now you wanna play grownups.

367
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:19,851
Where'd you get it?

368
00:28:19,918 --> 00:28:21,618
That's not important.

369
00:28:21,685 --> 00:28:23,888
You stole it.

370
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:25,189
Didn't you?

371
00:28:25,255 --> 00:28:26,957
I'm shot. I've been shot.

372
00:28:27,024 --> 00:28:29,526
There's a fucking bullet in my stomach, Chrissy.

373
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:35,934
Please.

374
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:37,968
I'm fucking begging you, please.

375
00:28:38,035 --> 00:28:40,037
Fuck, I'm scared, Christine.

376
00:28:41,806 --> 00:28:43,640
What do you want me to do, huh?

377
00:28:43,707 --> 00:28:45,309
Go ask Vic.

378
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:46,887
That whore.

379
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:53,383
Fuck.

380
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:13,470
It's a parole violation for me to associate with known felons.

381
00:29:13,537 --> 00:29:16,173
Look, I just need a ride to the hospital.

382
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,875
I can't drive you.

383
00:29:17,941 --> 00:29:19,609
I lost my license.

384
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,644
Even if I wanted to help you I can't.

385
00:29:21,711 --> 00:29:23,145
Anything else?

386
00:29:23,212 --> 00:29:24,882
Don't hang up.

387
00:29:24,948 --> 00:29:27,885
Then say it.

388
00:29:34,056 --> 00:29:37,260
Dad.

389
00:29:37,326 --> 00:29:41,163
Don't hang up, Dad.

390
00:29:42,966 --> 00:29:44,935
Now, see?

391
00:29:45,002 --> 00:29:47,905
That wasn't so hard now, was it?

392
00:29:47,971 --> 00:29:50,640
So you're in trouble, huh?

393
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,009
I've been shot.

394
00:29:52,074 --> 00:29:53,209
Hm.

395
00:29:53,276 --> 00:29:55,211
You don't sound shot.

396
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:58,047
I got some money, too.

397
00:29:59,181 --> 00:30:01,617
Hm. Is that why you're shot?

398
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,054
Yeah.

399
00:30:05,121 --> 00:30:07,356
Who'd you knock off? Vic?

400
00:30:07,423 --> 00:30:08,959
Oh, man.

401
00:30:09,026 --> 00:30:12,094
You are once special kinda fuck up, you know that?

402
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:15,398
So I guess I'm the only one that can help you, am I right?

403
00:30:15,464 --> 00:30:17,366
Are you still in Valdosta?

404
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:19,101
You already asked me that.

405
00:30:19,168 --> 00:30:20,736
Well, are you?

406
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:24,307
Fuck. Pft.

407
00:30:29,145 --> 00:30:31,180
So fucking.

408
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:10,787
Holy shit!

409
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:14,991
Chrissy.

410
00:31:15,025 --> 00:31:15,959
When?

411
00:31:16,026 --> 00:31:17,761
When were you shot?

412
00:31:17,828 --> 00:31:19,295
About an hour ago.

413
00:31:19,362 --> 00:31:21,163
Is there an exit wound?

414
00:31:26,937 --> 00:31:28,237
I don't think so.

415
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:30,673
Jesus. How much blood have you lost?

416
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,507
A lot.

417
00:31:31,574 --> 00:31:32,708
What's a lot?

418
00:31:32,776 --> 00:31:35,012
I don't know. A pint?

419
00:31:35,078 --> 00:31:36,013
You need a hospital.

420
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:37,014
I can't.

421
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,214
I can't do that.

422
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,415
Where are you?

423
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:41,183
I'm on a bus to Cairo.

424
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,819
Look, my hospital's not far from there.

425
00:31:42,886 --> 00:31:44,129
- Can... can you get a cab? - I need the chart.

426
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:45,163
I need you to get all the files.

427
00:31:45,187 --> 00:31:47,490
Shit.

428
00:31:47,556 --> 00:31:49,035
- How long do I got before I bleed out? - I can't tell over the phone.

429
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:50,202
Morgan, I need that chart ASAP!

430
00:31:50,226 --> 00:31:51,527
Yeah, coming, Doctor.

431
00:31:51,594 --> 00:31:52,739
Freddy, I can't make a diagnosis...

432
00:31:52,763 --> 00:31:54,230
Pressure's dropping.

433
00:31:54,296 --> 00:31:55,975
...but if you've lost a pint of blood.

434
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,299
Nurse, get that chart!

435
00:31:57,366 --> 00:31:59,836
Morgan! You dropped the ball.

436
00:32:04,141 --> 00:32:06,375
Look, just get to the hospital.

437
00:32:06,442 --> 00:32:07,719
I'll treat you in my car in the parking lot,

438
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:10,047
that way we won't have to register you.

439
00:32:10,113 --> 00:32:11,514
But if you need surgery.

440
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,417
You know what? I don't.

441
00:32:14,483 --> 00:32:15,986
Okay.

442
00:32:16,053 --> 00:32:17,687
You need to stop the bleeding.

443
00:32:17,754 --> 00:32:20,057
Direct pressure is how you do that.

444
00:32:20,123 --> 00:32:23,026
You need to get a cloth or something absorbent.

445
00:32:23,093 --> 00:32:24,326
I gotta go.

446
00:32:24,393 --> 00:32:25,695
Just get to the hospital

447
00:32:25,762 --> 00:32:27,296
and make sure you don't pass out.

448
00:32:33,904 --> 00:32:35,839
Hey.

449
00:32:37,007 --> 00:32:38,909
Do you have a pad?

450
00:32:38,975 --> 00:32:42,012
Like a... like a tampon?

451
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:44,114
What?

452
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:45,281
Please.

453
00:32:45,347 --> 00:32:46,950
Oh, shit.

454
00:32:47,017 --> 00:32:48,284
Please.

455
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:57,928
[Freddy Thank you.

456
00:32:57,994 --> 00:32:59,830
You got sliced?

457
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:00,931
Shot.

458
00:33:03,432 --> 00:33:05,102
You a gangster?

459
00:33:05,168 --> 00:33:06,502
Yep.

460
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:07,871
Don't tell no one.

461
00:33:15,377 --> 00:33:18,514
Well, if you a gangster, why are you on a bus?

462
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:20,917
Wasn't my intention initially.

463
00:33:21,885 --> 00:33:23,385
What'd you do?

464
00:33:23,452 --> 00:33:25,621
I took something that doesn't belong to me.

465
00:33:30,392 --> 00:33:32,728
Can I use your phone then?

466
00:33:32,796 --> 00:33:34,430
Why?

467
00:33:34,497 --> 00:33:36,265
So you can call that guy?

468
00:33:36,332 --> 00:33:39,970
Yeah. So what?

469
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:44,875
Fine.

470
00:33:48,011 --> 00:33:49,913
Take it.

471
00:33:58,922 --> 00:34:00,190
Don't pass out.

472
00:34:00,257 --> 00:34:02,558
You pass out, we ain't waking back up.

473
00:34:06,662 --> 00:34:07,831
Hi.

474
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:13,069
What do you want, man?

475
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:14,771
Do you know that girl?

476
00:34:14,838 --> 00:34:16,006
What?

477
00:34:16,072 --> 00:34:17,406
She's just a kid, dude.

478
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:21,609
Whoa.

479
00:34:21,676 --> 00:34:23,813
You got the wrong idea, my friend.

480
00:34:25,513 --> 00:34:27,315
I hope so.

481
00:34:29,018 --> 00:34:30,351
Are you a cop?

482
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,794
That's a guilty thing to ask.

483
00:34:38,861 --> 00:34:42,798
My name's Will. I work in Social Services.

484
00:34:42,865 --> 00:34:45,466
You don't look like a social worker.

485
00:34:45,533 --> 00:34:50,906
Well, we come in all shapes and sizes.

486
00:34:50,973 --> 00:34:54,342
Why the fuck is a social worker taking a bus?

487
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,681
Is that a real question you want an answer to?

488
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,078
Look, man, she asked to borrow my phone.

489
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:06,922
I gave it to her. I ain't bothering her.

490
00:35:06,989 --> 00:35:08,123
Hm.

491
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:13,528
Are we gonna have a problem?

492
00:35:18,433 --> 00:35:22,905
No. No problem.

493
00:35:22,972 --> 00:35:25,040
I had to check.

494
00:35:25,107 --> 00:35:26,474
I checked.

495
00:35:48,097 --> 00:35:49,965
Hello?

496
00:35:50,032 --> 00:35:52,500
She remind you of someone?

497
00:35:57,273 --> 00:35:59,275
Yup.

498
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:00,484
There goes another little girl

499
00:36:00,508 --> 00:36:03,611
your sorry ass let down.

500
00:36:03,678 --> 00:36:05,480
You're making a habit of this.

501
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,685
Hey, pst, what's the plan?

502
00:36:12,221 --> 00:36:15,157
The plan, the plan, the plan. Come on, man.

503
00:36:15,224 --> 00:36:16,624
Lily.

504
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,494
Bingo.

505
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,463
Get you patched up, we'll stick to the plan.

506
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,234
It's just you and me now.

507
00:36:25,301 --> 00:36:27,169
You and me.

508
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,059
Freddy?

509
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:51,659
Freddy, you there?

510
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:53,637
You won't believe what the fuck happened to me, man.

511
00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:55,130
So I got to Lake City,

512
00:36:55,197 --> 00:36:58,367
these motherfuckers straight up jumped my ass, bro.

513
00:36:58,434 --> 00:37:03,439
Yeah? So what'd you do?

514
00:37:03,504 --> 00:37:06,008
They had knuckles up, bro.

515
00:37:06,075 --> 00:37:08,743
I got away.

516
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:11,347
Are you still on the bus, man, or d... did you get off?

517
00:37:11,413 --> 00:37:12,781
Talk to me, man.

518
00:37:15,751 --> 00:37:18,320
Yeah, I'm still on the bus.

519
00:37:18,387 --> 00:37:19,520
I'mma come get you.

520
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:21,190
When's your next stop?

521
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:23,926
Fifteen minutes.

522
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:28,496
Where you gonna be at?

523
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,500
Pine Park.

524
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:34,702
Pine Park. All right, cool.

525
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:37,572
Sit tight, man. I'm gonna come get you.

526
00:37:49,617 --> 00:37:51,186
Please.

527
00:37:51,253 --> 00:37:52,955
I'm gonna be real gentle.

528
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:22,418
Chrissy, I'm seeing shit.

529
00:38:22,484 --> 00:38:25,586
Visions. Fucked-up shit.

530
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:27,032
You're becoming catatonic,

531
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:29,291
probably going into shock.

532
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:30,358
You said I needed blood.

533
00:38:32,361 --> 00:38:33,661
Like a transfusion?

534
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,197
Can you get it?

535
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,474
You're a rare blood type.

536
00:38:36,498 --> 00:38:38,666
That's a long shot.

537
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,035
What are my chances?

538
00:38:40,102 --> 00:38:41,246
I'd call your father.

539
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,205
I already did that.

540
00:38:43,272 --> 00:38:45,483
If you weren't shot, would you have called me?

541
00:38:45,507 --> 00:38:48,243
I told you why I called you.

542
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,686
Why now?

543
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:54,917
Because I'm going away.

544
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:59,054
This is it.

545
00:38:59,121 --> 00:39:01,290
You're always running away, Freddy.

546
00:39:08,464 --> 00:39:09,730
The fuck.

547
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,315
There he is.

548
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:29,450
I need a transfusion.

549
00:39:29,517 --> 00:39:32,652
You want my blood?

550
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:34,255
I'll pay you for it.

551
00:39:34,322 --> 00:39:35,957
I know you'll pay me.

552
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:39,594
It ain't that. I hate needles.

553
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:42,463
I'm fuckin' dying here, man! Are you gonna help me or not?

554
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,799
Phone.

555
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,870
Phone!

556
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:52,433
I told you I'm not doing nothing, man.

557
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,435
I know. I know.

558
00:40:54,502 --> 00:40:56,871
Then what do you want?

559
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,751
Look, I can see you're in some kind of trouble

560
00:41:00,775 --> 00:41:02,376
Back the fuck off, man.

561
00:41:02,443 --> 00:41:06,414
Hey, is she in trouble? Is she running away? What?

562
00:41:08,316 --> 00:41:10,017
You okay?

563
00:41:10,084 --> 00:41:12,753
She's hooking up with some guy she met online named Smokie.

564
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,455
That's all I know.

565
00:41:16,457 --> 00:41:17,925
Smokie.

566
00:41:19,126 --> 00:41:21,229
Guess his last name's The Bear or Robinson.

567
00:41:21,295 --> 00:41:23,464
I'm pretty sure that's not his real name.

568
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:26,801
How the hell would I know that?

569
00:41:26,867 --> 00:41:28,636
I can help her.

570
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:31,539
Then why are you talking to me?

571
00:41:31,606 --> 00:41:33,740
Because I see she trusts you.

572
00:41:33,808 --> 00:41:35,209
I'm a stranger to her.

573
00:41:35,276 --> 00:41:36,987
Sometimes these kids, they run the other way

574
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:40,348
once they find you're social services.

575
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,384
But you could sway her.

576
00:41:43,451 --> 00:41:45,953
You could get her to talk to me so I could help her.

577
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,923
God, I don't have time for that.

578
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,958
You're on a bus. What else you got to do?

579
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,396
- I gotta take this. - Hey.

580
00:41:55,463 --> 00:41:57,140
We gotta do somethin', man. She's just a kid.

581
00:41:57,164 --> 00:41:59,567
You do something. I gotta take this.

582
00:41:59,634 --> 00:42:01,369
Just talk to her.

583
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,737
I already have.

584
00:42:02,837 --> 00:42:04,272
Then tell her not to meet that guy.

585
00:42:04,338 --> 00:42:05,606
Come on, man.

586
00:42:05,673 --> 00:42:08,142
Okay, how about this? Okay, I'll call my office.

587
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:10,711
I'll tell them to come pick us up wherever she gets off.

588
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:11,955
Make sure she gets home safe...

589
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:13,281
All right. All right, man.

590
00:42:13,347 --> 00:42:14,649
I'll talk to her.

591
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,785
Good.

592
00:42:21,389 --> 00:42:22,389
J.J.

593
00:42:23,691 --> 00:42:26,060
You're not going to Pines Park.

594
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,496
You stole from me. Freddy.

595
00:42:28,562 --> 00:42:30,564
You put my whole crew on the line.

596
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,200
Where's J.J.?

597
00:42:33,267 --> 00:42:34,678
I'm gonna have to prove to the Puerto Ricans

598
00:42:34,702 --> 00:42:36,937
that I had no hand in this.

599
00:42:37,004 --> 00:42:39,340
Let me talk to him.

600
00:42:39,407 --> 00:42:42,510
I was warned not to trust you with a shipment this size.

601
00:42:42,576 --> 00:42:44,645
Put J.J. on the phone.

602
00:42:44,712 --> 00:42:45,980
Okay.

603
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,554
Freddy, Freddy, man.

604
00:42:53,621 --> 00:42:55,556
I... I didn't say anything, man.

605
00:42:55,623 --> 00:42:58,926
J.J., everything's cool, man. It's all good.

606
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,262
This is shit.

607
00:43:04,432 --> 00:43:05,733
Okay.

608
00:43:05,801 --> 00:43:07,702
We can make this right.

609
00:43:07,769 --> 00:43:09,270
Do you have the coke?

610
00:43:10,705 --> 00:43:12,707
Yeah.

611
00:43:12,774 --> 00:43:13,809
And the money?

612
00:43:13,874 --> 00:43:15,676
Yeah.

613
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:17,211
All of it?

614
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,517
All of it.

615
00:43:23,584 --> 00:43:25,419
Okay, I'm gonna need to see you.

616
00:43:25,486 --> 00:43:26,520
Where you headed?

617
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:31,325
I know you're hurting, okay?

618
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:34,528
I got a doctor lined up. We'll get you fixed up.

619
00:43:34,595 --> 00:43:36,063
Vic.

620
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:38,999
I know, baby, but they want blood.

621
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:40,468
And they already got Mac.

622
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:44,171
Please. Oh, my god.

623
00:43:44,238 --> 00:43:46,140
But Mac's not enough.

624
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,843
You're right.

625
00:43:47,908 --> 00:43:48,908
Mac won't be enough.

626
00:43:50,411 --> 00:43:52,079
Please!

627
00:43:52,146 --> 00:43:53,190
- No. - Hail Mary, full of grace,

628
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:54,315
the Lord is with thee.

629
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:55,916
Blessed art thou among women,

630
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:57,661
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus

631
00:43:57,685 --> 00:43:58,719
Oh, god, Vic, please.

632
00:43:58,787 --> 00:43:59,930
Pray for us sinners now,

633
00:43:59,954 --> 00:44:01,555
and at the hour of our death.

634
00:44:03,524 --> 00:44:04,868
Our Father who art in heaven...

635
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,128
Jesus, stop.

636
00:44:07,194 --> 00:44:08,996
Vic, stop. Please.

637
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,744
And lead us not into temptation

638
00:44:10,799 --> 00:44:11,799
but deliver us.

639
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:13,567
J.J. Stop, Vic. Please.

640
00:44:21,942 --> 00:44:24,311
Fuck.

641
00:44:26,313 --> 00:44:30,217
Okay. We're all good now.

642
00:44:30,284 --> 00:44:33,420
You can come back to the fold, baby.

643
00:44:33,486 --> 00:44:36,356
Everything can be healthy again.

644
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:39,559
Or I could pay Christine and Lily a visit.

645
00:44:45,131 --> 00:44:47,768
Save yourself a heart attack, man.

646
00:44:47,835 --> 00:44:49,669
God. Fuck.

647
00:44:49,736 --> 00:44:50,937
Mm. Fuck!

648
00:44:51,004 --> 00:44:53,306
Fuck! Fuck.

649
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:01,347
It's fine.

650
00:45:01,414 --> 00:45:04,885
You just stabbed your employer in the back twice.

651
00:45:11,691 --> 00:45:12,927
You fucked up.

652
00:45:12,992 --> 00:45:14,527
Get on it, goddammit!

653
00:45:14,594 --> 00:45:17,430
Get the money to Christine and Lily.

654
00:45:21,401 --> 00:45:22,502
Fuck.

655
00:46:24,999 --> 00:46:28,101
Lily?

656
00:46:39,045 --> 00:46:40,713
Do you know that girl?

657
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:44,117
She's just a kid, dude.

658
00:46:46,085 --> 00:46:47,420
Lily?

659
00:46:49,689 --> 00:46:52,358
Hey, do you mind?

660
00:46:52,425 --> 00:46:54,594
I'm trying to get some shut-eye here.

661
00:47:04,604 --> 00:47:07,875
What the fuck, dude?

662
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:34,835
I got us a ride.

663
00:47:34,902 --> 00:47:36,804
Let's do this fucking thing.

664
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:38,104
What changed?

665
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:39,706
Nothing changed.

666
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,942
Meet me at the bus station in Valdosta.

667
00:47:42,009 --> 00:47:43,944
What time do you get in?

668
00:47:44,011 --> 00:47:45,411
Any minute.

669
00:47:45,478 --> 00:47:47,413
I know this guy at the bar,

670
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,148
and he's gonna get us where we need to go.

671
00:47:49,215 --> 00:47:50,751
Some guy in a bar is gonna

672
00:47:50,818 --> 00:47:52,585
drive us fucking?

673
00:47:52,652 --> 00:47:54,822
What do you want, a fucking horse and carriage?

674
00:47:54,888 --> 00:47:55,888
You still got the money?

675
00:47:55,923 --> 00:47:57,858
Yeah, I still got it.

676
00:47:57,925 --> 00:47:59,559
Five minutes.

677
00:48:12,238 --> 00:48:13,974
Valdosta, comin' up.

678
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:15,776
Anybody for Valdosta?

679
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,783
I don't want you to meet that guy.

680
00:48:23,884 --> 00:48:26,152
I'm serious.

681
00:48:26,219 --> 00:48:29,188
Why are you trying to give me shit on my life?

682
00:48:31,058 --> 00:48:32,458
Just don't meet him.

683
00:48:36,429 --> 00:48:38,899
You trippin'.

684
00:48:38,966 --> 00:48:40,500
Look.

685
00:48:41,734 --> 00:48:44,637
I've been in your position before.

686
00:48:44,704 --> 00:48:49,777
Someone older gets in your head, takes advantage of you.

687
00:48:51,879 --> 00:48:53,446
It's messed up.

688
00:48:58,418 --> 00:49:00,653
I want you to do something for me.

689
00:49:02,488 --> 00:49:04,490
See that man over there?

690
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,862
I want you to talk to him.

691
00:49:18,237 --> 00:49:20,808
He's gonna help you.

692
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,442
I don't need help.

693
00:49:29,382 --> 00:49:31,217
Just hear him out, okay?

694
00:49:53,106 --> 00:49:55,273
Damn.

695
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:56,608
Where's your guy?

696
00:49:56,675 --> 00:50:00,579
He ain't here yet. Step off and let's wait.

697
00:50:00,645 --> 00:50:03,415
Said your guy from the bar is gonna drive us.

698
00:50:03,482 --> 00:50:04,917
Where's your guy?

699
00:50:04,984 --> 00:50:09,055
He's on his way. Now get off and we'll wait.

700
00:50:09,122 --> 00:50:12,591
On or off, son? We gonna keep having this dance?

701
00:50:14,259 --> 00:50:15,795
I ain't waiting out there.

702
00:50:17,029 --> 00:50:19,397
You can't wait five fucking minutes?

703
00:50:19,464 --> 00:50:21,033
All right, I'll get on with you.

704
00:50:22,902 --> 00:50:25,303
I'll tell my guy to meet us at the next stop.

705
00:50:26,404 --> 00:50:28,074
Get your ticket at the station.

706
00:50:28,141 --> 00:50:30,308
What?

707
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:32,344
You get your ticket in the station.

708
00:50:33,345 --> 00:50:34,981
Like everybody else.

709
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:38,985
I gotta get my ticket in the station,

710
00:50:39,051 --> 00:50:41,286
just like everybody else.

711
00:50:46,424 --> 00:50:47,960
Go ahead.

712
00:50:48,027 --> 00:50:49,327
Much obliged.

713
00:50:52,597 --> 00:50:55,433
Hey, miss me that much?

714
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,735
Put your headphones on.

715
00:50:59,071 --> 00:51:00,139
Who's this?

716
00:51:00,206 --> 00:51:02,041
Nobody.

717
00:51:02,108 --> 00:51:03,308
She's cute.

718
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:05,310
You sure ain't.

719
00:51:25,397 --> 00:51:27,332
So where'd you get clipped?

720
00:51:30,002 --> 00:51:34,106
That's gotta hurt.

721
00:51:34,173 --> 00:51:37,409
Hey, forget Valdosta.

722
00:51:37,944 --> 00:51:38,945
Cairo.

723
00:51:39,011 --> 00:51:41,914
Cairo. Get that? Mm-hm.

724
00:51:41,981 --> 00:51:43,381
All right.

725
00:51:45,084 --> 00:51:47,086
Okay.

726
00:51:47,153 --> 00:51:49,856
So where's my guy taking us?

727
00:51:49,922 --> 00:51:51,224
Hm?

728
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:52,366
Christine is going to meet us in the parking lot

729
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:53,558
where she works.

730
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:56,428
Hm. You and her still a thing?

731
00:51:56,494 --> 00:51:58,430
She's just doing me a favor.

732
00:51:58,496 --> 00:52:00,042
Well, she's too good for you.

733
00:52:00,066 --> 00:52:01,600
Always came running back.

734
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:04,103
Some chicks never learn that the guys they're with

735
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:06,404
are bad fuckin' news.

736
00:52:08,473 --> 00:52:10,408
I guess Mom did.

737
00:52:14,512 --> 00:52:15,513
Psst. Hey.

738
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,083
Cream pie.

739
00:52:17,149 --> 00:52:18,583
Where you going?

740
00:52:19,819 --> 00:52:21,354
What?

741
00:52:21,419 --> 00:52:23,322
What the fuck is wrong with you?

742
00:52:23,388 --> 00:52:25,024
I'm just talking to her.

743
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:26,125
How old are you anyway?

744
00:52:26,192 --> 00:52:27,326
Take a guess.

745
00:52:27,392 --> 00:52:28,392
Um, let's see.

746
00:52:28,426 --> 00:52:29,728
Stop bothering us.

747
00:52:29,795 --> 00:52:31,730
What do you...? He was talking to me.

748
00:52:31,797 --> 00:52:34,432
Now he ain't, so just turn around.

749
00:52:34,499 --> 00:52:35,935
What the fuck.

750
00:52:43,309 --> 00:52:45,410
So you pinch that from Vic or what?

751
00:52:48,281 --> 00:52:50,548
Tell me what the fuck you got me into or I'm out.

752
00:52:50,615 --> 00:52:51,984
What the fuck did you get me into?

753
00:52:52,051 --> 00:52:53,551
It's Vic's.

754
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,224
How much?

755
00:52:58,291 --> 00:52:59,859
Enough.

756
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:03,195
Well, that's a ballsy move, my friend.

757
00:53:03,262 --> 00:53:04,496
One you never made.

758
00:53:04,562 --> 00:53:06,032
Mm-hm.

759
00:53:06,098 --> 00:53:07,967
Why'd you take her shit?

760
00:53:08,034 --> 00:53:09,302
I needed out.

761
00:53:09,368 --> 00:53:11,337
Out? From what?

762
00:53:11,404 --> 00:53:13,172
From her.

763
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:14,572
From all of this.

764
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:17,575
I'm just gonna start something of my own.

765
00:53:17,642 --> 00:53:19,178
And... and...

766
00:53:19,245 --> 00:53:20,780
And what?

767
00:53:20,846 --> 00:53:23,581
And there's something for my daughter.

768
00:53:26,285 --> 00:53:29,055
Hm. Yeah. Oh, shit.

769
00:53:29,121 --> 00:53:31,891
The last time I saw her was at... I don't know.

770
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:34,760
Don't act like you remember.

771
00:53:34,827 --> 00:53:39,098
How old is Lily now, huh?

772
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,270
She's 11.

773
00:53:44,337 --> 00:53:47,173
Hm. Eleven.

774
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:50,176
Goddamn.

775
00:53:50,242 --> 00:53:52,011
You want to give her a future. I get it, son.

776
00:53:52,078 --> 00:53:55,281
I get it. I do. That's... That's... that's noble on you.

777
00:53:55,348 --> 00:53:59,819
Shit, half a mill. That'll do it, am I right?

778
00:54:04,857 --> 00:54:06,425
What did you just say?

779
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:11,496
I don't know. You told me how much.

780
00:54:11,563 --> 00:54:13,732
I didn't tell you shit.

781
00:54:13,799 --> 00:54:15,868
Well then, how else would I know?

782
00:54:17,403 --> 00:54:18,703
You called her.

783
00:54:20,139 --> 00:54:22,607
You called Vic.

784
00:54:22,674 --> 00:54:24,243
You piece of shit.

785
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:25,610
You told her where we're going.

786
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,215
Let go, son. Let go..

787
00:54:29,281 --> 00:54:30,281
Let the fuck go.

788
00:54:37,189 --> 00:54:38,457
Okay.

789
00:54:38,523 --> 00:54:40,359
Who oh.

790
00:54:40,426 --> 00:54:45,263
We're just gonna sit here quietly till we get to Cairo.

791
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:47,832
Vic's going to meet us there,

792
00:54:47,899 --> 00:54:51,535
and she's gonna make everything all right.

793
00:54:51,602 --> 00:54:54,571
Hey,

794
00:54:54,638 --> 00:54:56,083
what the fuck are you looking at, huh?

795
00:54:56,107 --> 00:54:57,208
Excuse me?

796
00:54:57,275 --> 00:54:59,277
Why don't you turn your fat ass around?

797
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:08,887
I wish things didn't have to go down like this. I do.

798
00:55:08,953 --> 00:55:13,191
I mean, it's... it's just the way things are, I guess.

799
00:55:14,325 --> 00:55:16,161
Listen, you know I know that I fucked up

800
00:55:16,227 --> 00:55:18,830
and I fessed up to that.

801
00:55:18,897 --> 00:55:22,033
I've had to live with the choices that I have made.

802
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:25,937
No. I've had to live with the choices you made.

803
00:55:26,004 --> 00:55:29,140
You sold out your own son so you can get back with Vic.

804
00:55:29,207 --> 00:55:30,707
Me and Vic are straight.

805
00:55:34,112 --> 00:55:38,049
Once, maybe. When you worked for her.

806
00:55:38,116 --> 00:55:39,757
And then you let her take me and seduce me

807
00:55:39,818 --> 00:55:41,753
as a fucking child.

808
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,355
Hey, it got you off that corner, right?

809
00:55:44,422 --> 00:55:46,157
You gotta start somewhere, boy.

810
00:55:46,224 --> 00:55:47,926
You should a protected me.

811
00:55:47,992 --> 00:55:51,196
Protected you? Protected you from what?

812
00:55:51,262 --> 00:55:52,964
You... you idolized Vic.

813
00:55:53,031 --> 00:55:55,533
She was like a mother to you. I fucking gave you that.

814
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:56,733
You didn't give me nothing.

815
00:55:56,801 --> 00:55:58,803
Oh, come the fuck off it.

816
00:55:58,870 --> 00:55:59,914
When the fuck are you gonna start taking

817
00:55:59,938 --> 00:56:01,239
some fucking responsibility?

818
00:56:01,306 --> 00:56:02,550
You just gonna blame me for everything

819
00:56:02,574 --> 00:56:03,975
in your motherfucking life?

820
00:56:04,042 --> 00:56:05,443
Do you know what she did to me?

821
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:07,045
Do you know what she did to me?

822
00:56:11,316 --> 00:56:13,684
She kicked you out because you were her bitch.

823
00:56:13,751 --> 00:56:16,121
You followed her around like a little dog.

824
00:56:17,522 --> 00:56:19,491
Fuck you.

825
00:56:19,557 --> 00:56:21,059
- "I love you, Vic." - Fuck you.

826
00:56:21,126 --> 00:56:22,827
- "I love you." - Fuck you.

827
00:56:25,763 --> 00:56:27,365
She always wanted me over you

828
00:56:27,432 --> 00:56:29,334
and you hated me for it.

829
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,804
This wasn't about the money.

830
00:56:33,838 --> 00:56:36,707
You did this so you can get back with Vic.

831
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:40,778
But she's not gonna take you back.

832
00:56:41,379 --> 00:56:43,647
You're a rat.

833
00:56:43,714 --> 00:56:45,716
And Vic kills rats for fun.

834
00:56:49,621 --> 00:56:51,389
Fuck.

835
00:56:51,456 --> 00:56:55,093
At least I had the balls to take something for myself,

836
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,395
to start over.

837
00:56:57,462 --> 00:56:59,130
"Start over."

838
00:57:04,169 --> 00:57:06,971
Man, what the fuck are you gonna start over?

839
00:57:08,206 --> 00:57:09,841
I've seen monkey shit fights at the zoo

840
00:57:09,908 --> 00:57:11,943
that are more organized than you.

841
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:14,711
I didn't do anything wrong.

842
00:57:14,779 --> 00:57:18,750
Fuck me. You're a fake.

843
00:57:18,816 --> 00:57:21,352
Everything about you is fake.

844
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,056
Your gold chain is fake.

845
00:57:25,123 --> 00:57:27,592
Your fucking Timex is fake.

846
00:57:27,659 --> 00:57:29,726
That is a real Timex.

847
00:57:39,304 --> 00:57:41,072
Motherfuckers.

848
00:58:06,898 --> 00:58:08,266
Get up.

849
00:58:16,341 --> 00:58:17,775
Let him up.

850
00:58:20,345 --> 00:58:21,345
Easy, bro.

851
00:58:22,413 --> 00:58:23,413
Hey.

852
00:58:23,448 --> 00:58:24,849
I'll snitch.

853
00:58:24,916 --> 00:58:26,293
I will tell this prick what you got in there.

854
00:58:26,317 --> 00:58:27,452
Hey.

855
00:58:27,518 --> 00:58:28,719
Cops could be here in no time.

856
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:33,258
Hey, I got it under control.

857
00:58:33,324 --> 00:58:35,360
- Hey, hi. How you doing? - Off the bus.

858
00:58:35,426 --> 00:58:37,262
Oh, now. Wait, wait, wait, wait a second.

859
00:58:37,328 --> 00:58:38,229
You too.

860
00:58:38,296 --> 00:58:39,964
Oh, come on, man. He attacked me.

861
00:58:40,031 --> 00:58:41,942
I don't want to hear it. Both of you, off the bus.

862
00:58:41,966 --> 00:58:43,110
Okay, yeah, we'll... we'll get off. Come on.

863
00:58:43,134 --> 00:58:44,535
We'll... we'll both get off.

864
00:58:44,602 --> 00:58:46,771
Hey, timeout. Look. This is what happened.

865
00:58:46,838 --> 00:58:48,373
This guy, he started all this shit.

866
00:58:48,439 --> 00:58:50,008
And this guy, he was defending her.

867
00:58:50,074 --> 00:58:51,743
- Wasn't he? - Yes.

868
00:58:51,809 --> 00:58:54,412
He was defending me because that creep tried to touch me.

869
00:58:54,479 --> 00:58:56,257
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, son. I never touched this girl.

870
00:58:56,281 --> 00:58:57,750
Well, I saw him do it.

871
00:58:57,815 --> 00:58:59,817
- He attacked her. - No, no, fuck this shit.

872
00:58:59,884 --> 00:59:00,928
They... they're trying to set me up.

873
00:59:00,952 --> 00:59:02,287
Hey, I know what I saw.

874
00:59:02,353 --> 00:59:03,697
He tried to grab her and that's a fact.

875
00:59:03,721 --> 00:59:04,922
Oh, no. This is some bullshit.

876
00:59:04,956 --> 00:59:06,324
He tried to grab me too.

877
00:59:06,391 --> 00:59:07,391
Lying bitch.

878
00:59:07,425 --> 00:59:09,794
Sir, shut the fuck up.

879
00:59:09,861 --> 00:59:12,530
Ma'am, do you want me to call the cops or not?

880
00:59:12,597 --> 00:59:15,266
No. Throw him off.

881
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:18,603
Don't throw that guy off for trying to protect me.

882
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:20,505
Let's go.

883
00:59:20,571 --> 00:59:21,873
No. Wait a second.

884
00:59:21,939 --> 00:59:23,250
- Wait a second. - Sir, you'll notice

885
00:59:23,274 --> 00:59:25,943
I have already pulled the bus over.

886
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:28,279
My next move is to call the cops.

887
00:59:28,346 --> 00:59:30,848
Where we are, I figure that'd take about five minutes.

888
00:59:30,915 --> 00:59:32,350
They're friends of mine.

889
00:59:34,686 --> 00:59:36,220
Okay.

890
00:59:37,155 --> 00:59:41,259
Okay, brother. You're the boss.

891
00:59:41,326 --> 00:59:43,861
I'm... I'm stepping right off.

892
00:59:46,029 --> 00:59:47,864
You need my blood, right?

893
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:50,000
I don't want your blood inside of me.

894
00:59:50,067 --> 00:59:54,137
Go fuck yourself.

895
00:59:54,204 --> 00:59:55,605
Get your fucking hands off me.

896
00:59:55,672 --> 00:59:57,483
You think you're the first crazy to ride this bus

897
00:59:57,507 --> 00:59:59,811
that thinks he can push me around and get away with it?

898
00:59:59,876 --> 01:00:02,646
I deal with degenerates like you every fucking day.

899
01:00:02,713 --> 01:00:04,247
Come on.

900
01:00:13,857 --> 01:00:15,525
Ain't you fuckin' Roger.

901
01:00:36,713 --> 01:00:40,283
Hey. I got thrown off.

902
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:41,451
Come pick me up.

903
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,764
Pretty wild there for a second, huh?

904
01:00:56,266 --> 01:00:57,634
Let me get my piece back.

905
01:00:57,701 --> 01:00:59,837
Huh?

906
01:00:59,903 --> 01:01:03,306
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

907
01:01:03,373 --> 01:01:05,909
Take it, man. I don't want it.

908
01:01:07,277 --> 01:01:10,547
I'm gonna go see if I shit myself.

909
01:01:10,614 --> 01:01:12,716
Next stop, Cairo.

910
01:01:12,784 --> 01:01:15,385
That's Cairo. Last chance.

911
01:01:19,256 --> 01:01:20,768
Lopez family.

912
01:01:20,792 --> 01:01:22,626
Please report to the nurses' station.

913
01:01:22,692 --> 01:01:24,693
Lopez family. Please report to the nurses' station.

914
01:01:25,228 --> 01:01:26,696
I fucked up.

915
01:01:26,764 --> 01:01:28,665
I'm in trouble. I lost the blood.

916
01:01:28,732 --> 01:01:29,801
I think I found some.

917
01:01:29,867 --> 01:01:30,967
What?

918
01:01:31,034 --> 01:01:33,203
Is it gonna be enough?

919
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:35,705
Enough to lose my job over.

920
01:01:35,773 --> 01:01:37,216
Look, I'll meet you in the car in the parking lot

921
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,209
like I said before, okay?

922
01:01:39,276 --> 01:01:40,577
How long 'til you get here?

923
01:01:40,644 --> 01:01:42,379
I'm gonna figure that out.

924
01:01:42,446 --> 01:01:43,180
Thank you.

925
01:01:43,246 --> 01:01:44,916
Don't thank me yet.

926
01:02:37,067 --> 01:02:38,803
Hey, Mom. Mom?

927
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:40,437
Lily? What are you doing here?

928
01:02:40,504 --> 01:02:41,738
The movie's over.

929
01:02:41,806 --> 01:02:42,840
Can I get a ride home?

930
01:02:45,008 --> 01:02:47,577
Yeah. Come on.

931
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,122
Are you going to be okay?

932
01:03:04,862 --> 01:03:06,162
Yeah.

933
01:03:09,165 --> 01:03:11,468
Thanks...

934
01:03:11,535 --> 01:03:13,169
for what you did.

935
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:17,909
Hey...

936
01:03:17,975 --> 01:03:19,743
what's your name?

937
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:21,211
Rachel.

938
01:03:22,746 --> 01:03:24,247
Rachel.

939
01:03:26,082 --> 01:03:27,350
I'm Freddy.

940
01:03:44,434 --> 01:03:47,337
How old are you really?

941
01:03:52,175 --> 01:03:53,778
I'm 15.

942
01:04:02,586 --> 01:04:04,421
I'm 14.

943
01:04:17,434 --> 01:04:20,470
You really need a hospital, man.

944
01:04:24,174 --> 01:04:28,411
Rachel, this is Will.

945
01:04:30,113 --> 01:04:31,481
Hi.

946
01:04:31,548 --> 01:04:33,283
- Hi. - Hi.

947
01:04:37,354 --> 01:04:39,023
I gotta go check this out.

948
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,261
Come on.

949
01:04:49,767 --> 01:04:50,800
You want some help, man?

950
01:04:50,867 --> 01:04:52,368
No.

951
01:04:53,569 --> 01:04:54,737
Fuck.

952
01:05:03,113 --> 01:05:05,048
Hey, you okay?

953
01:05:05,115 --> 01:05:06,348
- Yeah. - Yeah.

954
01:05:09,351 --> 01:05:10,619
Sit down there.

955
01:05:17,961 --> 01:05:19,395
You like puzzles?

956
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,234
Looks hard.

957
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:26,735
Yeah.

958
01:05:29,171 --> 01:05:30,439
Six.

959
01:05:44,821 --> 01:05:46,588
Where are you, Freddy?

960
01:05:46,655 --> 01:05:48,624
I need you to just listen.

961
01:05:50,093 --> 01:05:51,393
What?

962
01:05:54,363 --> 01:05:56,866
I'm... I fucked up bad.

963
01:05:58,868 --> 01:06:01,071
That doesn't change anything, Freddy.

964
01:06:01,137 --> 01:06:02,906
I know.

965
01:06:02,972 --> 01:06:05,240
I know. But I can change.

966
01:06:05,307 --> 01:06:06,542
No.

967
01:06:07,409 --> 01:06:09,311
You chose Vic.

968
01:06:10,579 --> 01:06:13,415
Over me. Over Lily.

969
01:06:14,316 --> 01:06:15,584
You never did anything for us.

970
01:06:15,651 --> 01:06:17,352
You did everything for Vic.

971
01:06:20,355 --> 01:06:23,392
You broke me, Freddy.

972
01:06:27,563 --> 01:06:29,833
Why are you doing this?

973
01:06:29,899 --> 01:06:31,835
I'm doing this for Lily.

974
01:06:31,901 --> 01:06:33,511
Lily doesn't need your money, Freddy.

975
01:06:33,535 --> 01:06:36,505
Lily needed a father.

976
01:06:36,572 --> 01:06:39,241
I want her to do something good with her life.

977
01:06:44,047 --> 01:06:46,049
Take the money.

978
01:06:50,686 --> 01:06:52,354
Just get here.

979
01:06:53,255 --> 01:06:54,991
Thank you.

980
01:07:08,872 --> 01:07:12,407
Mm, nine.

981
01:07:12,474 --> 01:07:14,743
Maybe eight.

982
01:07:14,811 --> 01:07:17,646
- Maybe a three. - Wrong number.

983
01:07:17,713 --> 01:07:18,782
Hmm.

984
01:07:34,197 --> 01:07:35,765
That's one.

985
01:07:44,174 --> 01:07:45,241
Yeah. You're funny.

986
01:07:45,307 --> 01:07:46,308
Nine.

987
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:47,877
You're funny.

988
01:08:01,858 --> 01:08:03,458
You're funny.

989
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,902
Four.

990
01:08:15,805 --> 01:08:18,107
Six.

991
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:21,077
Seven.

992
01:08:28,952 --> 01:08:30,519
Try him again.

993
01:08:46,269 --> 01:08:47,636
Uh-huh.

994
01:08:47,703 --> 01:08:50,773
Motherfucker works in social services,

995
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,442
finds a girl online. Arranges a meet.

996
01:08:54,476 --> 01:08:56,846
Then why's he tailing her?

997
01:08:56,913 --> 01:08:58,447
Make sure she gets on the bus?

998
01:08:58,513 --> 01:09:00,616
Keep a close eye? The fuck do I know?

999
01:09:07,389 --> 01:09:09,524
But she's already on the bus.

1000
01:09:09,591 --> 01:09:11,094
Why does he have to do that?

1001
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,729
He's preying on her.

1002
01:09:13,796 --> 01:09:16,132
He gets off on it, that's what these creeps do.

1003
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:18,167
See, Smokie doesn't show up at the bus station

1004
01:09:18,234 --> 01:09:19,534
like they arranged.

1005
01:09:19,601 --> 01:09:21,271
Now she's alone.

1006
01:09:21,337 --> 01:09:23,806
But this dude, Will? This kind gentleman she met on the bus?

1007
01:09:23,873 --> 01:09:24,941
He can help her.

1008
01:09:25,008 --> 01:09:27,210
He swoops in. He can play the hero.

1009
01:09:27,277 --> 01:09:30,346
Says it's getting late, offers her a place to stay

1010
01:09:30,412 --> 01:09:31,748
I got it.

1011
01:09:56,238 --> 01:09:57,248
Oh, how about this?

1012
01:09:59,341 --> 01:10:00,375
This is fun.

1013
01:10:16,825 --> 01:10:18,592
Hey, Smokie.

1014
01:10:21,096 --> 01:10:24,465
I know what you're doing, you fuck.

1015
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:31,373
Sorry, wrong number.

1016
01:10:39,815 --> 01:10:40,849
- You okay? - Mm-hm.

1017
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:42,184
I'm gonna go check on him.

1018
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:43,718
Oh, okay.

1019
01:11:06,274 --> 01:11:08,477
Yeah.

1020
01:11:08,542 --> 01:11:10,544
You don't look so hot.

1021
01:11:12,814 --> 01:11:15,283
Leave her alone.

1022
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:17,052
What you gonna do?

1023
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,189
Call the cops? Considering your situation,

1024
01:11:21,256 --> 01:11:23,291
that wouldn't be very smart of you now,

1025
01:11:23,358 --> 01:11:24,893
would it?

1026
01:11:28,629 --> 01:11:31,565
So what do you want to do, huh?

1027
01:11:31,632 --> 01:11:34,735
You want money? How much?

1028
01:11:36,171 --> 01:11:39,207
You assume you know what I want.

1029
01:11:41,276 --> 01:11:42,811
Five thousand.

1030
01:11:42,878 --> 01:11:45,147
You ain't getting it, friend.

1031
01:11:45,213 --> 01:11:46,882
Now, look.

1032
01:11:48,682 --> 01:11:50,819
I appreciate you putting in a good word

1033
01:11:50,886 --> 01:11:55,791
for me with Rachel, but I'm not for sale.

1034
01:11:55,857 --> 01:11:59,027
Ten thousand dollars.

1035
01:11:59,094 --> 01:12:01,196
You can buy whoever you want with that.

1036
01:12:01,263 --> 01:12:03,031
Just stay away from her.

1037
01:12:03,098 --> 01:12:04,366
You don't got it.

1038
01:12:04,433 --> 01:12:05,699
I do.

1039
01:12:14,342 --> 01:12:15,676
I tell you what.

1040
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:20,048
How about...

1041
01:12:20,115 --> 01:12:23,752
Hm... she comes with me anyway...

1042
01:12:25,153 --> 01:12:27,255
and when you die from all that blood

1043
01:12:27,322 --> 01:12:28,957
that you seem to be losing,

1044
01:12:29,024 --> 01:12:31,126
I'll come back for the money as well?

1045
01:12:32,194 --> 01:12:33,228
Hm?

1046
01:12:34,695 --> 01:12:36,064
Twofer.

1047
01:12:37,766 --> 01:12:40,102
If you will.

1048
01:12:40,168 --> 01:12:41,303
Hm?

1049
01:13:19,441 --> 01:13:23,078
You and me, it's over.

1050
01:13:23,145 --> 01:13:24,813
You need to come back.

1051
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,382
You made a big mistake.

1052
01:13:27,449 --> 01:13:29,351
Do not fuck with me.

1053
01:13:55,877 --> 01:13:57,612
Freddy?

1054
01:13:57,678 --> 01:14:00,081
Chrissy, I'm not going to make it.

1055
01:14:00,148 --> 01:14:01,416
What?

1056
01:14:05,453 --> 01:14:07,556
I got the blood, the drip.

1057
01:14:07,622 --> 01:14:09,124
No.

1058
01:14:09,191 --> 01:14:10,926
No.

1059
01:14:10,992 --> 01:14:12,336
Look, if you can't get to me,

1060
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,862
let me drive to you.

1061
01:14:13,929 --> 01:14:15,640
Where'd you say you were going again? Cairo?

1062
01:14:15,664 --> 01:14:17,566
I said I'm not coming.

1063
01:14:17,632 --> 01:14:18,743
I don't need your help anymore.

1064
01:14:18,767 --> 01:14:19,777
I don't need you and I don't...

1065
01:14:19,801 --> 01:14:21,937
I got Lily with me.

1066
01:14:22,003 --> 01:14:23,805
No, Chrissy, please.

1067
01:14:23,872 --> 01:14:25,173
Here, talk to her.

1068
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:33,882
Talk to him just once.

1069
01:14:33,949 --> 01:14:34,983
You don't gotta be nice.

1070
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:36,685
Just let him hear your voice.

1071
01:14:36,751 --> 01:14:38,153
Hello?

1072
01:14:43,658 --> 01:14:45,327
Hi, baby.

1073
01:14:45,393 --> 01:14:46,928
You doing all right?

1074
01:14:47,529 --> 01:14:49,798
Yeah. You?

1075
01:14:56,238 --> 01:14:57,772
I'm trying.

1076
01:14:58,974 --> 01:15:00,808
I'm trying real hard.

1077
01:15:06,013 --> 01:15:07,414
I miss you.

1078
01:15:07,481 --> 01:15:10,050
I'm sorry that I haven't been around.

1079
01:15:13,921 --> 01:15:15,389
Freddy?

1080
01:15:22,162 --> 01:15:24,798
I'm taking the money and I'm leaving.

1081
01:15:24,865 --> 01:15:26,834
I don't need your help anymore.

1082
01:15:30,571 --> 01:15:33,474
You were Plan B.

1083
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:36,110
You were always just Plan B.

1084
01:15:37,578 --> 01:15:39,647
So stay the fuck away.

1085
01:15:43,117 --> 01:15:45,452
You were right, Chrissy.

1086
01:15:46,787 --> 01:15:51,358
I chose Vic. I always chose Vic.

1087
01:16:14,348 --> 01:16:16,550
I love you, Mama.

1088
01:16:18,886 --> 01:16:20,487
I love you too, baby.

1089
01:17:28,222 --> 01:17:30,190
There's your Smokie.

1090
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:35,095
What?

1091
01:17:35,696 --> 01:17:37,931
Will.

1092
01:17:37,998 --> 01:17:40,634
Will is Smokie.

1093
01:17:40,701 --> 01:17:42,771
He's playing you.

1094
01:17:42,837 --> 01:17:44,304
Nah. I think you've...

1095
01:17:44,371 --> 01:17:47,776
I think you've lost a little bit too much blood.

1096
01:17:47,842 --> 01:17:49,943
Cairo in five minutes.

1097
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:52,179
Five minutes to Cairo.

1098
01:17:57,084 --> 01:17:59,186
All right. All right, I got an idea.

1099
01:17:59,253 --> 01:18:02,089
That's my boy!

1100
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:05,159
An idea for what?

1101
01:18:05,225 --> 01:18:06,994
You gotta trust me.

1102
01:18:09,163 --> 01:18:11,833
Empty your backpack.

1103
01:18:32,019 --> 01:18:34,621
Fill your bag up with this.

1104
01:18:37,057 --> 01:18:38,725
Then put your stuff in mine.

1105
01:18:40,994 --> 01:18:42,362
Why am I doing this?

1106
01:18:42,429 --> 01:18:45,432
I need you to get it to someone.

1107
01:18:45,499 --> 01:18:49,269
Her name is Christine. Take my phone.

1108
01:18:49,336 --> 01:18:51,806
Call her and get the money to her.

1109
01:18:51,873 --> 01:18:54,174
Can you do that?

1110
01:18:54,241 --> 01:18:56,643
How do you know I'm not gonna steal it?

1111
01:18:59,881 --> 01:19:01,648
Because I'm trusting you.

1112
01:19:05,686 --> 01:19:08,722
I told you before, someone took advantage of me.

1113
01:19:11,024 --> 01:19:13,427
Look, what I lost, I can't get back.

1114
01:19:17,564 --> 01:19:20,400
You gotta still believe you're worth something.

1115
01:19:20,467 --> 01:19:23,504
Even when nobody else does, you gotta believe.

1116
01:19:28,408 --> 01:19:31,144
You got your whole life ahead of you, Rachel.

1117
01:19:32,881 --> 01:19:34,214
You make the right choice.

1118
01:19:47,094 --> 01:19:49,263
What do you want me to tell her?

1119
01:19:50,564 --> 01:19:52,065
Tell her...

1120
01:19:53,768 --> 01:19:57,371
tell her, when we were at that state park...

1121
01:19:58,705 --> 01:20:00,340
on the water...

1122
01:20:02,142 --> 01:20:04,344
I knew right then that I loved her.

1123
01:20:07,446 --> 01:20:08,782
But I didn't say it.

1124
01:20:12,585 --> 01:20:15,087
But I could never be a father.

1125
01:20:19,292 --> 01:20:22,628
So tell her I wish I'd said it.

1126
01:20:24,297 --> 01:20:26,299
Can you do that for me?

1127
01:20:28,634 --> 01:20:29,702
Yeah.

1128
01:20:39,312 --> 01:20:43,716
Tell her that I'm sorry.

1129
01:20:43,784 --> 01:20:45,953
I'm so fucking sorry.

1130
01:20:48,721 --> 01:20:51,657
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1131
01:20:51,724 --> 01:20:52,793
Look at me.

1132
01:20:54,995 --> 01:20:58,832
You're going to be okay.

1133
01:20:58,899 --> 01:21:00,934
You're gonna be fine.

1134
01:21:01,001 --> 01:21:02,803
You're gonna be fine. We're almost there.

1135
01:21:02,869 --> 01:21:05,872
You're gonna tell her. You're gonna be okay.

1136
01:21:06,873 --> 01:21:08,741
Okay?

1137
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,948
Just give me my bag.

1138
01:21:21,922 --> 01:21:23,155
Put it here.

1139
01:21:29,662 --> 01:21:31,697
- Take this. - Okay.

1140
01:21:31,765 --> 01:21:33,132
Go sit up front.

1141
01:21:37,804 --> 01:21:39,840
Hey.

1142
01:21:39,906 --> 01:21:41,108
Okay.

1143
01:21:41,173 --> 01:21:43,076
You're gonna be okay.

1144
01:21:45,144 --> 01:21:46,445
Hey.

1145
01:21:49,181 --> 01:21:50,449
You got this.

1146
01:21:58,792 --> 01:21:59,860
I got this.

1147
01:22:05,966 --> 01:22:06,967
Everything okay?

1148
01:22:07,034 --> 01:22:08,035
Yes.

1149
01:22:27,186 --> 01:22:29,422
Everything happens for a reason.

1150
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:07,794
You got this.

1151
01:23:41,995 --> 01:23:43,997
Last stop, Cairo.

1152
01:24:19,166 --> 01:24:20,566
Rachel.

1153
01:24:21,935 --> 01:24:22,969
Thanks.

1154
01:24:26,472 --> 01:24:28,574
I've gotta get you out of here.

1155
01:24:30,277 --> 01:24:33,445
He's a very bad person and I've gotta protect you.

1156
01:24:37,017 --> 01:24:38,484
You can trust me.

1157
01:24:40,954 --> 01:24:42,555
Good girl. Let's go.

1158
01:24:48,995 --> 01:24:51,097
Go ahead.

1159
01:24:52,364 --> 01:24:53,967
You too. Get out of here.

1160
01:25:05,377 --> 01:25:06,679
You with him?

1161
01:25:06,746 --> 01:25:07,781
Yes.

1162
01:25:07,848 --> 01:25:09,648
Run along, sweetheart.

1163
01:25:11,183 --> 01:25:12,483
Ah!

1164
01:25:13,285 --> 01:25:14,619
Not you.

1165
01:25:15,221 --> 01:25:16,654
Rach.

1166
01:25:16,721 --> 01:25:19,357
Don't worry about her. Just open the bag.

1167
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,460
Rach.

1168
01:25:22,527 --> 01:25:23,796
Where you going?

1169
01:25:23,863 --> 01:25:27,532
I said open the fucking bag.

1170
01:25:28,868 --> 01:25:30,135
Why?

1171
01:25:39,311 --> 01:25:40,880
Make sure it's all there.

1172
01:26:23,554 --> 01:26:24,790
Oh!

1173
01:26:31,529 --> 01:26:32,530
Oh, yeah.

1174
01:26:40,406 --> 01:26:43,175
I'm not going with you.

1175
01:26:49,748 --> 01:26:52,151
I'm not going with you, Vic.

1176
01:26:56,554 --> 01:26:58,223
Oh, baby.

1177
01:27:33,859 --> 01:27:35,027
We good?

1178
01:27:40,631 --> 01:27:42,567
Get him the fuck out of here.

1179
01:27:50,541 --> 01:27:51,977
No.

1180
01:27:53,278 --> 01:27:54,579
No.

1181
01:28:24,977 --> 01:28:27,678
What the fuck? It's some fucking bullshit.

1182
01:28:27,746 --> 01:28:29,614
This is fucking bullshit.

1183
01:28:32,583 --> 01:28:34,053
Huh?

1184
01:28:40,125 --> 01:28:41,293
What the fuck.

1185
01:28:43,262 --> 01:28:44,897
What the fuck is this?

1186
01:30:03,609 --> 01:30:05,643
- Hello? - Christine?

1187
01:30:05,710 --> 01:30:07,146
Who's this?

1188
01:30:12,351 --> 01:30:13,952
I'm Rachel.

1189
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,089
I'm a friend of Freddy's.

1190
01:30:18,156 --> 01:30:20,825
