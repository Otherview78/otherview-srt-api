1
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,064
Morning, Mr. Thrombey.

2
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,663
Mr. Thrombey? You up there?

3
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:03,374
Mr. Thrombey, I'm coming in.

4
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,678
Shit!

5
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,951
<i>You killed him, you bastard!</i>

6
00:02:39,035 --> 00:02:40,202
<i>You murdered him!</i>

7
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:41,620
<i>I didn't murder nobody!</i>

8
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,122
<i>You slashed his face open.</i>

9
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:45,583
<i>You left him bleeding in the street
like a stuck pig,</i>

10
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,626
<i>then you crushed his skull with a forklift</i>

11
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,129
<i>and burned his hands off
to erase the fingerprints!</i>

12
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,547
<i>You'll never prove it.</i>

13
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,716
<i>We have the nanny-cam footage!</i>

14
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,509
Alice, turn that off now, please?

15
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,762
- Why? It's almost over.
- Now. Please, just turn it off.

16
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,139
They're finding out who did it
and the Wi-Fi sucks in my room--

17
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,266
- Turn it off, now. Alice!
- There's two minutes left.

18
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,185
- What? There isn't even anything bad on.
- Off!

19
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:05,895
It's just normal TV,
and they're just talking!

20
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,313
They're talking murder on it!

21
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,899
- They're just talking.
- Your sister just had a friend she loved

22
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:13,235
slit his throat open and she doesn't need
to be hearing that right now!

23
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,653
Let's be sensitive!

24
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,951
Alice, you can keep watching your show.
It's fine.

25
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,162
- No, I guessed who did it anyway.
- It's okay.

26
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,288
I'm sorry, Marta.

27
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:25,623
It's okay.

28
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,584
It's Harlan's son.

29
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,589
Hi, Walt.

30
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:34,965
<i>Hi, Marta, It's Walt.</i>

31
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:37,718
<i>Would you mind coming to the house early?</i>

32
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:40,429
<i>The police have
a few more questions for everybody.</i>

33
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,098
What?

34
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,786
Hey. Excuse me, ma'am.

35
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,079
You with the help?

36
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,832
Hey! Her name's Marta.
She was Granddad's nurse.

37
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,167
She's with us. "The help"?

38
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:12,670
It's okay. I'm sorry.

39
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,131
No, it's not okay. What the hell?

40
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,058
How are you doing?

41
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,395
Not very good.

42
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:30,479
Alone.

43
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:35,067
Lots of this
and not knowing what to do next.

44
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:39,196
Marta, anything you need...

45
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:41,407
You're part of this family.

46
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:44,618
Thank you.

47
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,289
- How you doing, kiddo?
- Linda.

48
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:50,624
How are you?

49
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:56,046
You know, the funeral helped, I guess.
Just seeing him.

50
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,923
I thought you should have been there.

51
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,884
- I was outvoted.
- Get arrested!

52
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,261
- Die up your own ass for all I care!
- Richard.

53
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:04,680
He's not coming.

54
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,558
Ransom. Little shit.

55
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,642
Missed the funeral.

56
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,769
Excuse me.

57
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:13,981
We're ready for you now.
We'd like to see you one at a time.

58
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,275
All right. I'll go first.

59
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,987
I'm assuming this will all be wrapped up
before the memorial tonight.

60
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:21,697
We'll do our best, ma'am.

61
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,576
So...

62
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,328
how you doing, kiddo?

63
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,373
We're just gonna reintroduce ourselves
as a formality.

64
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:33,083
I am Detective Lieutenant Elliott,

65
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,044
and this is Trooper Wagner.

66
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:40,424
Now, I'm going to record this,
just to make things easier.

67
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:43,761
All right, we're with
Linda Drysdale née Thrombey,

68
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,596
Harlan Thrombey's eldest daughter,

69
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,266
and discussing the events that took place
the night of his demise one week ago.

70
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,726
November 8th.

71
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,520
We're very sorry for your loss.

72
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:56,232
Thank you. That means a lot.

73
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,944
So, we understand on that night
the family had gathered

74
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,696
- to celebrate your father's 85th birthday?
- Yes.

75
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,574
- How was it?
- The party?

76
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,535
Pre-my-dad's-death?

77
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,703
Oh, it was great.

78
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:12,373
Did anyone besides the family show face?

79
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:15,042
<i>Fran, the housekeeper.</i>

80
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,254
He was a nice guy, but he was so hairy.

81
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,089
- Jacob?
- And I've dated Italian guys.

82
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,924
You know what I mean? It was like...

83
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,593
<i>Marta, Harlany's caregiver.</i>

84
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:26,595
<i>Good girl. Hard worker.</i>

85
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:28,222
Her family's from Ecuador.

86
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,182
And Wanetta.

87
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,935
<i>Greatnana. Harlan's mom.</i>

88
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,853
- Hi, Nana.
- <i>His mom?</i>

89
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,314
- Nana?
- <i>Wow. How old is she?</i>

90
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,108
<i>We have no idea.</i>

91
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,318
Okay... and your son, Ransom,

92
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,320
<i>did he attend as well?</i>

93
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:45,030
<i>Yes, but he left early.</i>

94
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,201
Ransom, are you leaving?

95
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,332
Right.

96
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,210
Would you say that all three of you
showed up around the same time?

97
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,713
No.

98
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,635
Richard came early
to help the caterers set up.

99
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:09,972
Okay. And you and your husband, Richard,
work at a real estate firm in Boston?

100
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,516
No. It's-- It's my company.

101
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,101
Right. Right. Sorry.

102
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,728
I built my business from the ground up.

103
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,146
Oh, just like your father.

104
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,106
You two were very close.

105
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:23,819
We-- We had our own secret way
of communicating.

106
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,031
I mean, you had to find that... with Dad.

107
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,074
You had to find a game to play with him,

108
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:32,661
and if you did that,
and you played by his rules...

109
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,753
Everyone idolizes their dad, right?

110
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,838
I don't know. Do they?

111
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,174
Very much not.

112
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,217
Don't know why I said that.

113
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:49,428
<i>But my wife, Linda, does.</i>

114
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,431
<i>Harlan started out
with a rusty Smith Corona</i>

115
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:56,727
<i>and built himself into one of the
best-selling mystery writers of all time.</i>

116
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,981
Wow, seems like all his kids
are self-made overachievers.

117
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,443
Sure.

118
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,653
For the record,
I'm speaking with Walt Thrombey,

119
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:09,114
Harlan Thrombey's youngest son.

120
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:11,742
So you run your father's
publishing company?

121
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,161
Yeah. It's my-- It's our--

122
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,246
It's the family's publishing company.

123
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,581
Dad trusts me to run it.

124
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,334
Thirty languages.

125
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,837
Over 80 million copies sold.
A real legacy.

126
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:25,923
You guys fans?

127
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,675
I mean, I don't do much
fiction reading myself, but--

128
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:30,260
Big fan. I'm a big fan.

129
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,513
I mean, his plots are just like...

130
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,474
Like, I won't spoil it for you but--
Okay, like <i>Thousand Knives?</i>

131
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,892
The cow and the shotgun.

132
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:39,186
Like, where do you come up with that?

133
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,898
Well, Dad said the plots just popped
into his head, fully formed.

134
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,441
It was the easy part for him.

135
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:48,487
So you're in the area, right?

136
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,115
So, you guys probably arrived
around the same time.

137
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,160
We all got here around 8:00.

138
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:57,830
<i>My wife, Donna, she's my rock.</i>

139
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,667
Jesus, Donna! Are you all right?

140
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,170
<i>My son, Jacob, he's 16.</i>

141
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:07,673
<i>Very politically active.</i>

142
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,216
The boy is literally a Nazi.

143
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,051
He's an alt-right troll dipshit.

144
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,971
Kids today with the Internet,
it's amazing.

145
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,515
So the night went well?

146
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,644
<i>I mean, we're all gutted, but...</i>

147
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,938
<i>I was happy to have that night with him.</i>

148
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,231
<i>To be by his side,</i>

149
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,693
<i>to think about our books
and what we've accomplished with them.</i>

150
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,904
It's like I can still feel his hand
on my shoulder.

151
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,740
Passing the torch.

152
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:36,493
So, we're here with Joni Thrombey,

153
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,412
Harlan Thrombey's daughter-in-law?

154
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,290
Yeah, I married his son, Neil.

155
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,417
We had one daughter, Meg.

156
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,379
And then Neil passed on 15 years ago.

157
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:49,465
But you remained close to the Thrombeys?

158
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,092
They're my family.

159
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,556
<i>I feel simultaneously freed by</i>

160
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,268
<i>and supported by them.</i>

161
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,192
It's that balance of opposites
that's the nugget of Flam.

162
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,402
Sorry, the nugget of...

163
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:11,904
Flam.

164
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,781
Oh, yeah, Flam,
your skin care company. Sorry.

165
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,366
I forgive you.

166
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,412
Yeah, it's skin care,
but it promotes a total lifestyle.

167
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:24,041
Self-sufficiency with an acknowledgement
of human need.

168
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,250
That's Flam.

169
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:26,835
But it's also Harlan.

170
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,421
He got me and Meg
through some tough times.

171
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,673
Granddad gives my mom a yearly allowance

172
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:34,927
and he's never missed wiring
a tuition payment to my schools.

173
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,306
He's a genuinely selfless man.

174
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,850
But you left the party early?

175
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:42,976
Have fun.

176
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,228
<i>To see some friends at Smith.</i>

177
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:49,983
You know Dad pays for her
crypto-Marxist-post-deconstructural-

178
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,611
feminist-poetry-theory-whatever major?

179
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,947
She could have stuck around for the cake.

180
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,324
<i>I think Linda was upset.</i>

181
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,663
But Harlan understood.

182
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,126
Right.

183
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,797
You two showed up to the party
around the same time--

184
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,007
If I could pause?

185
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,259
Because I just...

186
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,177
Who is that guy?

187
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:20,472
- And why are we doing all this again?
- These are just some follow-up questions.

188
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:23,642
We're attempting to be thorough,
so we can figure out the manner of death.

189
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,812
So by "manner of death,"
you mean if someone killed him?

190
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,814
If one of us killed him?

191
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,108
- One of his family killed him?
- No, Walt-- Walt, no, no.

192
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,068
Is that what you're suggesting,
Lieutenant?

193
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,320
No one's saying that, okay?
This is all pro form a.

194
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,072
Okay.

195
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,658
So who the fuck is that?

196
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,161
This is Benoit Blanc.

197
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,039
- Benoit Blanc?
- Yes.

198
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,501
Mr. Blanc is a private investigator
of great renown.

199
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:50,586
Wait a minute.

200
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:54,047
I read a tweet about
a <i>New Yorker</i> article about you.

201
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,508
"The Last of the Gentlemen Sleuths."

202
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:58,885
You solved that case
with the tennis champ.

203
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,014
You're famous.

204
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,224
Mr. Blanc is not
with the police department

205
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:05,976
and not officially involved in the case,

206
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,644
but he's offered to consult.

207
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,230
Now I happily obliged,
and I can vouch for him.

208
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:11,940
Mr. Blanc, I know who you are.

209
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:13,859
I read your profile in the <i>New Yorker.</i>

210
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,694
I found it delightful.

211
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,949
I just buried my 85-year-old father
who committed suicide.

212
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,826
Why are you here?

213
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,539
I'm here at the behest of a client.

214
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,207
Who?

215
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,461
I cannot say.

216
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,004
But let me assure you of this.

217
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:37,549
My presence will be ornamental.

218
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,719
You will find me a respectful,

219
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,639
quiet, passive observer...

220
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:45,974
of the truth.

221
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,018
Fine.

222
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,395
Are we getting there?

223
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,688
Nearly. Um...

224
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:55,651
Harlan's nurse, she was at the party
in a professional capacity?

225
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,027
Marta?

226
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:58,695
I guess.

227
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:03,283
<i>Harlan hired her to be around to take care
of whatever medical needs popped up.</i>

228
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:06,536
<i>But really, she's like part of the family.</i>

229
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,288
<i>Good kid.</i>

230
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:09,748
<i>Been a good friend to Harlan.</i>

231
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,958
<i>Family's from Paraguay.</i>

232
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,127
Linda really likes her work ethic.

233
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,215
"Immigrants. We get the job done."

234
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,761
- I...
- From <i>Hamilton.</i>

235
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,304
Oh, <i>Hamilton.</i>

236
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:25,430
It's so good.

237
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,182
- I saw it at The Public.
- Oh!

238
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,352
May I just...

239
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,105
Then I'll recede, but...

240
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,899
as a self-made man myself,

241
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,069
I have to express my admiration

242
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,571
for how you followed
in your father's footsteps.

243
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,826
- Thank you.
- Just marvelous.

244
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,869
You know, the whole family too.

245
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,830
And Joni with her thing,

246
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,332
and Walt with his publishing empire...

247
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,625
It's...

248
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:55,585
Well...

249
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,840
Yes, I mean, Walt, he's done well

250
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,092
with what Dad gave him.

251
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,593
Not that it matters.

252
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:07,764
But really, Dad hands him a book
twice a year and Walt publishes it.

253
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,101
It's just not the same.

254
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,855
But surely Walt runs
the merchandising, adaptations,

255
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,857
film and television rights, I mean...

256
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,067
Are you baiting me, Detective?

257
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,737
You know he doesn't.

258
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,906
And if you think I am dumb enough

259
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,868
to be baited into talking family business,

260
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:32,164
into shit-talking my baby brother
in front of a police detective

261
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:33,415
and a state trooper--

262
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,792
Walt doesn't run shit.

263
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,378
Because there are no TV and film rights.

264
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:41,214
Harlan never allowed
any adaptations of his books.

265
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:42,507
Hated the idea.

266
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:43,633
No.

267
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:44,968
Yeah!

268
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,929
Drives Walt nuts.
'Cause that's where the real money is.

269
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,391
When Walt would get
a little Irish courage in him,

270
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,101
<i>he'd get into it with Harlan.</i>

271
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:55,729
Did he "get into it" at the party?

272
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,314
Oh, my God!

273
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,398
Come on, Dad!

274
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,275
<i>Wouldn't leave him alone, the poor guy.</i>

275
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,612
- <i>Harlan finally had to give him the hook.</i>
- ...their business affair guy...

276
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,197
<i>I didn't hear what he said,</i>

277
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,574
<i>but he must've really
handed him his lunch.</i>

278
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:11,244
<i>'Cause Walt was like a wounded puppy
the rest of the night.</i>

279
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,704
What? Richard said what?

280
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:14,748
No. Jesus. We did not get "into it."

281
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,709
I'm just trying to get
an accurate impression.

282
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,545
Harlan took you aside at the party.

283
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,673
When you returned, you were chastened.

284
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,428
What did Harlan say to you?

285
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:32,057
The Netflix guys,
their business affair guy.

286
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,184
He sent something over.
It's hard numbers this time.

287
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,604
And I just think this is a window
that's not gonna stay open.

288
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,732
We need to take advantage of it and then
you just need to look at the numbers!

289
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,776
- Yeah, Walt, look--
- Dad! Dad!

290
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,612
You-- You put me in charge of our books.

291
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,490
Let me be in charge!
Let me do this! Please!

292
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,951
They're not our books, son.

293
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,661
They're my books.

294
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,289
And this is not how I wanted
to have this conversation.

295
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,708
But you're right, you're right. It's--

296
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:02,754
It's unfair of me to keep you tethered

297
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:05,632
to something that isn't yours to control.

298
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:06,716
What?

299
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,428
No, I've done you a grave disservice.

300
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,681
All these years,

301
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:18,228
I've kept you from building something
of your own that was yours.

302
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:25,193
But you're not going to be running
the publishing house anymore.

303
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,070
You're free of it.

304
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,114
Wh--

305
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,367
Dad, are you firing me?

306
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,035
No, I--

307
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,162
We'll talk details tomorrow.

308
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,498
My mind's made up.

309
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,334
Good boy.

310
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:52,804
We talked. We had
a business discussion about e-books.

311
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,891
Jesus. It was nothing.

312
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,562
You want to talk about an argument,
hell, Ransom had an argument with him.

313
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:01,855
Ransom, that's...

314
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,565
Richard and Linda's son?

315
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,319
Look, we all love Ransom.
He's a good kid. We love him.

316
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:10,739
But?

317
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,283
But he's always been
the black sheep of the family.

318
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,994
And I'm not trying to--

319
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,913
I like to keep stuff like this
in the family.

320
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:20,749
But with Ransom, he's never had a job.

321
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,961
And Dad, for some unknown reason,
always supported him.

322
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,548
They have this love-hate bond. They fight.

323
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,177
But that night, God, they had a blowout.

324
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:33,970
About what?

325
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,805
Are you goddamn insane?

326
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,350
<i>We couldn't make it out really,
but it was huge.</i>

327
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,811
<i>And it's strange they went
into another room to do it.</i>

328
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:45,941
<i>Usually they like to stoke up drama
in front of the whole family.</i>

329
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,026
Speaking of getting into it...

330
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:53,865
You were at the house early
to help the caterers set up. Did...

331
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:57,285
Did you converse with Harlan at that time?

332
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,704
Well, he was there. We must have spoke.

333
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,039
In his study?

334
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,501
I don't think so.

335
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:08,129
You see,
I spoke with the caterer this morning.

336
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,590
She didn't see you helping her staff.

337
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,718
She did hear Harlan in a screaming match

338
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:16,680
with somebody that afternoon in his study.

339
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,224
Yeah, I don't-- Screaming match?

340
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:22,352
No.

341
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,146
But Joni was here too.

342
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,565
She was early, so it might have been her.

343
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,650
Maybe ask her.

344
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,777
These were two male voices.

345
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,946
<i>Harlan shouted the phrase...</i>

346
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,031
You tell her or I will!

347
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,200
"You tell her...

348
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,619
or I will."

349
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:42,956
Bells ringing?

350
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,341
That's none of your business.

351
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:54,551
You stay out of my marriage.

352
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,554
I know my daughter,
and she would want to know.

353
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,223
I've put all of it in this letter to her.

354
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,725
Tomorrow, she gets it.

355
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,601
Harlan, I'm warning you.

356
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,395
- No, she deserves to know.
- Stay out of my marriage.

357
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,439
She deserves to know,
and you're gonna tell her.

358
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:10,442
- The hell I am!
- You tell her or I will!

359
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,988
Yes. I know.

360
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:17,991
Yes.

361
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:25,498
Harlan had finally decided
to put his mom in a nursing home,

362
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,459
and Linda had always opposed that.

363
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:31,463
And I wanted to wait until we got back
to Boston to tell Linda,

364
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:34,090
so to avoid a whole scene,

365
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,926
and Harlan wanted me to tell her then.

366
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,137
That was it.

367
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,639
Sorry. Forgot.

368
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,725
The house?

369
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,645
Earlier. Richard said you were there.

370
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:50,023
I was at the house early.

371
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,400
To see Harlan?

372
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,903
To see Harlan.

373
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,654
Yes.

374
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,741
What were you seeing Harlan about?

375
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,786
It was just a mix-up with the...

376
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,871
the payment for Meg's tuition.

377
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,206
I'm-- I'm--

378
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,832
I'm sorry to press,

379
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,002
but what kind of mix-up?

380
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:16,341
Yeah, the school hasn't got the check yet.
I don't know why Alan didn't mail it.

381
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,969
Well, Alan didn't mail it
because he caught a discrepancy.

382
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:25,225
Alan's office has been wiring tuition
directly to the school

383
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,851
as per your request.

384
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:30,271
But Phyllis's office that handles
your yearly allowance

385
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:34,025
has been wiring tuition monies
directly to you as well.

386
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:39,239
You have been double-dipping Meg's tuition
and stealing from me--

387
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:42,325
...$100,000 a year,

388
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,077
for the past four years.

389
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,246
Harlan, I don't know
how this mix-up happened,

390
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,498
- but I swear to God--
- So, now I am writing

391
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:52,252
this tuition check, but you must know
that this is the last money

392
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:55,797
you or Meg will get from me.

393
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,132
Please, you don't understand--

394
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,842
Joni, I know it'll hurt,

395
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:00,760
but it's all for the best.

396
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,888
My mind's made up.

397
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,435
It was a money wiring issue

398
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,062
with the office at the school.

399
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:14,107
So I had to ask Harlan
to cut a check for the semester.

400
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,442
No big deal.

401
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:17,569
Well...

402
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:20,446
Why don't we, uh, just take
a little break and we'll resu--

403
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,656
Oh, no.

404
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,032
She's gone.

405
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,125
Richard!

406
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:34,878
Joni, have you seen Richard?

407
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,672
- No, I was just done with the--
- Okay, thanks.

408
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:40,425
No.

409
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:42,760
Damn it. Richard!

410
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:45,930
Richard?

411
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:17,212
Son of a bitch.

412
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:30,767
See, I might be a victim
of my own expectation here,

413
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,062
but when the great Benoit Blanc
comes knocking at my door,

414
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,233
I expect it's going to be about something,
if not extraordinary,

415
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:40,401
then at least interesting.

416
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:43,780
But I'm sorry,
this is an open-and-shut case of suicide

417
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,449
and quite frankly, Benny,
we're getting to the point

418
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,243
where I need to know
what we're doing here.

419
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:49,535
The method?

420
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,247
Throat slit?

421
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,707
Typical for a suicide?

422
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,626
Yes, I mean, that's dramatic.

423
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,044
But look around.

424
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,381
I mean, the guy practically lives
in a Clue board.

425
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,431
Come on, Benny, talk to me, all right?

426
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:13,017
Now, you tell me to invite
all of these people back

427
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,061
for questioning all over again.

428
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,145
I get it.

429
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,356
I've had boots on the ground
in this county for a while.

430
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:21,567
People are generally what they seem to be.
Not gonna find murderers in this family.

431
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,153
This is a pleasant family
with the usual quarrels,

432
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:25,989
but no possible motives for murder.

433
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:27,699
Where are you going?

434
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,956
Harlan Thrombey's nurse. Marta...

435
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:36,958
- Cabrera.
- Marta Cabrera. Please.

436
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,584
Miss Cabrera, you can just wait inside

437
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,712
- and we'll be with you in--
- Miss Cabrera.

438
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,216
I've been doin' a little pokin'.

439
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:49,595
You were hired on a part-time basis
as a registered nurse, yes?

440
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,098
Yes. I don't work for a VNA.

441
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:53,975
Harlan hired me directly.

442
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,476
Take a seat, please.

443
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:59,105
And you're paid a flat rate for...

444
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:01,149
how many hours a week?

445
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,653
Well, I started at 15, and then he...

446
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:07,780
he needed more help.

447
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:09,449
Medical help?

448
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,453
He needed a friend.

449
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:19,625
Does having a kind heart
make you a good nurse?

450
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:22,253
All right, Blanc, I mean, this is--

451
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:26,215
Yeah, yeah. Marta? We were just discussing
possible motives in the family.

452
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:31,179
I suspect that Harlan has told you
much unfiltered truth about each of 'em.

453
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:34,474
And a little bird has told me--

454
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:37,185
How shall I put this delicately?

455
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:44,192
You have a regurgitative reaction
to mistruthin'.

456
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:46,444
Who told you that?

457
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,321
Is it true?

458
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,491
Yes.

459
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,285
It's something I've had since I was a kid.

460
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:56,496
It's a physical thing that I...

461
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,539
Just the thought of lying...

462
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:01,084
Yeah, it makes me puke.

463
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,543
Really?

464
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:08,549
Is Richard havin' an affair?

465
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:18,101
Why do men instinctively
pull at loose threads on their parachutes?

466
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:20,395
What?

467
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,028
Richard?

468
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:33,408
- An affair?
- Yeah.

469
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,910
A yes or no will do.

470
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,123
No.

471
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:45,420
Oh, shit!

472
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,630
- Oh, my God!
- Dear girl, I'm sorry.

473
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,757
I assumed you were speaking figuratively.

474
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:52,009
- I have Wet-Naps in the car.
- All right, here.

475
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,594
Just take a sip of this.

476
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:54,929
Take that.

477
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,055
That's quite somethin'.

478
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,891
- Thanks.
- But I was obviously right.

479
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,018
Richard is having an affair.

480
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:03,312
His father-in-law found out
and confronted him.

481
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:04,564
"You tell her or I will."

482
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:07,483
Okay, but even if that were the case--
You all right?

483
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,944
- Yeah.
- Even if that were the case, I mean,

484
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,280
protecting a relationship as a motive,
that's weak sauce.

485
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:15,324
- You know that.
- Well, then there is Joni.

486
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:16,409
- Joni?
- Joni?

487
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:18,035
Lifestyle guru Joni? No.

488
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:20,746
Harlan was supporting her and her daughter
and that's the opposite of a motive.

489
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,666
And if that support was threatened--
Miss Cabrera, one moment, please.

490
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,960
- Yes, I just wanna get some Scope.
- Miss Cabrera...

491
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:30,798
Was Harlan plannin' on
cutting off Joni's allowance?

492
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,178
Oh, Joni.

493
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:37,680
What's up?

494
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:41,976
Oh, my God.

495
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,604
All right, don't answer that
if you're gonna puke again, please.

496
00:26:44,687 --> 00:26:46,522
Meg said he paid the school directly.

497
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:48,149
Joni said he sent the money to her.

498
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,359
Both were true.

499
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,320
She was pocketing the double payment.

500
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:55,323
Harlan found out
and cut her off without a cent. Yes?

501
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:59,494
So she bumps him off for the inheritance?

502
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:02,580
Come on, no, have you seen her Insta?
She's an influencer.

503
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:05,833
No. Allowance as a motive?
Again, more weak sauce.

504
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:07,668
You're just dumpin' that vat
of weak sauce on me.

505
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:09,712
Granted. But she lied to me.

506
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:11,881
All three of them did.

507
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:12,965
Three?

508
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:15,593
Walter.

509
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,012
I see where you're going with this.

510
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,890
Harlan had turned Walter down before
regarding film rights,

511
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:23,392
but that night,
somethin' Harlan said shook him.

512
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,144
Now we look at the pattern.

513
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:27,063
Harlan was cleanin' house.

514
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,148
No wonder.

515
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:31,859
Did he plan to fire Walter?

516
00:27:31,943 --> 00:27:34,153
Can I just wait inside?
I feel like I shouldn't be here.

517
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:36,572
Yeah, please, just wait inside.
Stay close, all right?

518
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,704
You have been very patient, my friend.

519
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:45,748
And yes,

520
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:47,333
you are right.

521
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,835
None of these weak alibis
and domestic squibbles

522
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,045
answer your question,

523
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,881
"Why is Benoit Blanc here?"

524
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:56,884
Well, now I will tell you why.

525
00:27:57,969 --> 00:28:02,473
I'm here because this mornin',
someone dodged a very important question.

526
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:04,850
Who?

527
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:06,602
Me.

528
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,896
Linda asked who hired me.

529
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:10,982
Well, who hired you?

530
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:13,276
I do not know.

531
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:17,154
An envelope of cash showed up
at my apartment yesterday

532
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:19,448
with a news clippin' of Thrombey's death.

533
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:20,908
An envelope? That worked?

534
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:24,495
An envelope of cash.

535
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:27,790
So somebody suspects foul play

536
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:31,252
and goes through
this ha-cha dance of hiring me,

537
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:32,712
of staying anonymous.

538
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,840
It makes no damn sense.

539
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:39,051
Compels me, though.

540
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:44,056
Walk me through everyone's whereabouts
at the time of death.

541
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:48,436
We know that the party ended around 11 :30.

542
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,937
- Good night, Joni.
- Night.

543
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:52,690
<i>Marta took Harlan upstairs
to give him his meds.</i>

544
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:59,530
<i>The stairs leading up to Harlan's bedroom
and his attic office creak horribly</i>

545
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:01,532
<i>and Linda is a light sleeper.</i>

546
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:04,452
<i>So we know every time
someone took the stairs that night.</i>

547
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:09,790
<i>The first was when Joni heard a ka-thunk</i>

548
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:11,667
<i>from somewhere above her in the house.</i>

549
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:24,639
<i>She's concerned about Harlan,
so she goes up to investigate.</i>

550
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:27,308
<i>Waking Linda.</i>

551
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:30,227
<i>Harlan was in his attic office with Marta.</i>

552
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:31,812
- Hi, Joni.
- I just-- Hi.

553
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:34,148
<i>He explained that they had
knocked over the Go board.</i>

554
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:35,691
I just knocked over the Go board, so...

555
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,568
<i>That game with the grid and stones.</i>

556
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:38,861
<i>They play it every night.</i>

557
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,154
<i>He was fine. "Go to bed."</i>

558
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,614
Go to bed, Joni.

559
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,240
- Love you. Night.
- Love you.

560
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:44,784
- <i>So she did.</i>
- Bye.

561
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,954
<i>Ten minutes later,
Linda is awoken a second time.</i>

562
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:52,208
<i>By Marta leaving.</i>

563
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,126
Walt, I'm leaving.

564
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:57,046
<i>Walt was smokin' a cigar
on the porch with his son.</i>

565
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,048
<i>He saw her leave and drive off.</i>

566
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:01,050
<i>Noted the time.</i>

567
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:02,635
<i>Midnight.</i>

568
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,309
<i>Fifteen minutes later,</i>

569
00:30:10,393 --> 00:30:13,020
<i>Linda is awoken for the third
and final time...</i>

570
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:17,983
<i>...by someone coming down the stairs.</i>

571
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:20,486
<i>Harlan, who came down
for a midnight snack.</i>

572
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,154
Dad, go back to bed.

573
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:24,198
<i>Which Walt tried to discourage.</i>

574
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:28,077
<i>Based on this, the medical examiner
determined the time of death</i>

575
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,080
<i>to be between 12:</i><i>15 and 2:</i><i>00 a.m.</i>

576
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:34,959
<i>As Walt was finishing his cigar
at about 12:</i><i>30, Meg came home.</i>

577
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,627
<i>She went straight to bed.</i>

578
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:39,004
<i>Walt and Jacob
turned in shortly after that.</i>

579
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,300
<i>And sometime later that night,</i>

580
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:46,345
<i>it's undetermined,
but possibly near 3:</i><i>00 a.m.,</i>

581
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:49,014
<i>Meg woke up because
the dogs were barking outside.</i>

582
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:52,059
<i>She used the bathroom, went back to bed.</i>

583
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,520
That's it. All right?

584
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,355
Now, everyone's stories matched,

585
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:58,274
every moment accounted for.

586
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:02,528
And there is no other staircase
up to Harlan's room?

587
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,447
None. Just the creaky one.

588
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,698
Interesting.

589
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:08,576
So, uh, we know that Ransom didn't do it

590
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:09,952
because he wasn't there.

591
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,412
Marta couldn't have.

592
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,247
Harlan was still alive when she left.

593
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,749
- Yeah.
- Meg...

594
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:17,543
Meg came home during the window
of the time of death, right?

595
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,587
Except it was a suicide, all right?

596
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,797
Harlan slit right through his carotid.

597
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:24,967
We saw from the blood splat patterns
that they were uninterrupted,

598
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:28,721
meaning it's almost impossible for anyone
to have been around him at the time.

599
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:32,641
He's the one who cut his own throat.
I don't know why we keep goin' over this.

600
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:36,687
Physical evidence can tell a clear story
with a forked tongue.

601
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:40,357
- What?
- And as we can see from this mornin',

602
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:42,485
everyone can lie.

603
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:47,031
Well, almost everyone.

604
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:50,826
Miss Cabrera...

605
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:56,040
We kept you waiting all afternoon,
because I wanted to hear from you last.

606
00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:01,253
I needed an entire picture
of the evening in my head,

607
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:05,382
and your piece of it
is at its very center.

608
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:09,053
So, please, take your time.

609
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:15,309
You took Mr. Thrombey upstairs at 11 :30

610
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:17,478
and left at midnight.

611
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:23,192
Think very carefully
and with as much detail as possible.

612
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:27,071
Tell us what happened in that half hour?

613
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,119
- Up, up, up, I got it.
- You got it?

614
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:36,497
Up, up, up, I got it.
Up, up, up, I got it.

615
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,040
- Up, up, up, I got it.
- Okay, that's--

616
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,792
- Up, up, up, I got it.
- Hey, Harlan.

617
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,252
- Up, up, up, I got it.
- Let's--

618
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:42,628
Up, up, up, I got it.

619
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:44,463
- Okay.
- No second thoughts.

620
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:46,215
No. No, no, no, no.

621
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,925
- Get up here!
- I had a glass of champagne.

622
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,301
- Harlan, listen to me.
- We are--

623
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:51,095
- It's late. I had--
- You only had one glass.

624
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:52,638
Exactly. A glass of champagne.

625
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,932
We are not breaking tradition
on my birthday!

626
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:57,017
Can you just take your goddamn medicine
and go to bed?

627
00:32:57,101 --> 00:33:00,688
If you're gonna put that vile shit in me,
you have to earn it.

628
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,439
On my birthday.

629
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:03,941
- Oh, God.
- Eighty-fifth birthday.

630
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:06,819
- Fine. Jesus!
- I'm so old.

631
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,029
- I'm so old.
- You really love drama, huh?

632
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:12,157
Okay, let's do this. Nine-by-nine.

633
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:13,325
- Right.
- You ready?

634
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:14,910
- I'll whip your ass.
- Are you sure?

635
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,287
Yeah. Yeah.

636
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,580
How dare you.

637
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,375
I know how this is gonna end.

638
00:33:23,294 --> 00:33:24,628
What is that?

639
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:26,338
Why can't I beat you at this game?

640
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:29,550
Because I'm not playing to beat you.
I'm playing to build a beautiful pattern.

641
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,051
That's elder abuse.

642
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:32,678
I'm gonna call the AARP.

643
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:34,305
Don't make me get the belt, <i>abuelo.</i>

644
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:35,973
It's basically over.

645
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,393
My only hope
is that an earthquake will strike.

646
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:42,062
But what are the chances?

647
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:46,734
Hello?

648
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,402
Hello? Hello?

649
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,654
Hello? Get under a door frame!

650
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:52,323
Yes!

651
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,579
Such a bad loser you are! Meds, then bed.

652
00:33:59,413 --> 00:34:00,748
I'm done with you.

653
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:03,042
That's fair.

654
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:08,631
Walt is smoking that filthy cigar
out there on the porch.

655
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,633
Dead and nasty things.

656
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:13,594
How was tonight?

657
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:16,221
Tonight was... good.

658
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:17,890
Oh, yeah?

659
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:20,267
I know you weren't looking forward to it.

660
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:21,685
No. But I did it.

661
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,813
I cut the line on all four of 'em.

662
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,232
Yeah.

663
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:29,151
Wasn't easy.

664
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:32,154
This goddamn fortune.

665
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,868
You know, sometimes I think
that everything I've given my family,

666
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,745
I've done maybe

667
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,666
without knowing,
or maybe to keep them beneath me.

668
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,335
I certainly should have...

669
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:49,755
I don't know, encouraged Walt

670
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:52,841
to write his own stories, not just be...

671
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:55,844
a caretaker of mine.

672
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,972
Like you said I should.

673
00:34:58,055 --> 00:35:00,766
And then be a father
and not just a provider

674
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:03,227
for Joni, like you also said.

675
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:06,313
And I could have been kinder
to Linda and Ransom.

676
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,316
Jesus! Ransom.

677
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:14,530
There's so much of me in that kid.

678
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,366
Confident. Stupid.

679
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,619
I don't know, protected.

680
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:25,541
Playing life like a game,
without consequence.

681
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:29,712
Until you can't tell the difference

682
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,381
between a stage prop...

683
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,175
and a real knife.

684
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:38,053
You know, I don't fear death.

685
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:40,264
But, oh, God,

686
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:44,309
I'd like to fix some of this before I go.

687
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:46,520
Close the book with a flourish.

688
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,025
I guess we'll see.

689
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,360
I guess we will.

690
00:35:58,949 --> 00:35:59,950
Hey.

691
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,660
You had a long day.

692
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:03,871
You wanna do drugs?

693
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:05,789
You mean the good stuff?

694
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:07,166
Yeah?

695
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:11,378
Oh, come on, send me to la-la land.

696
00:36:11,462 --> 00:36:12,921
Just a tiny bit, okay?

697
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,759
Why did I wait till my mid-age
to become a morphine user?

698
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,927
What a schmuck.

699
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:20,679
What a nudnik. This--

700
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,057
This stuff is the best.

701
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:29,688
Oh, my God.

702
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,357
Is there a problem?

703
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:37,446
This is what I just gave you
100 milligrams of.

704
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:40,532
I messed up.

705
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:44,161
You gave me 100 milligrams
of the good stuff?

706
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:50,125
Excuse me, but what is the good stuff's
dosage supposed to be?

707
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,336
Let's not call it that right now, okay?

708
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:53,879
Three milligrams.

709
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,130
Oh, that's much less.

710
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,466
So what happens?

711
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:00,052
I'm gonna give you
an emergency shot of Naloxone,

712
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,762
so you don't die in ten minutes.

713
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,138
Oh, well, no pressure.

714
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:06,433
You know, this is an interesting

715
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:09,019
and efficient method of murder.

716
00:37:09,103 --> 00:37:10,521
I need to write this down.

717
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:14,733
So, if someone switched
the meds on purpose,

718
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:16,318
I'd be dead in ten minutes.

719
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:19,154
- Like stone-cold dead?
- Yes.

720
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:20,656
You'll feel symptoms in five.

721
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,282
Sweats, disorientation, and then...

722
00:37:23,534 --> 00:37:26,286
Yes. That big dose injected,
within ten, your...

723
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:28,330
Your brain--

724
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:30,958
Yes, ten minutes.

725
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,459
From the moment of injection?

726
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:34,503
It's eight-ish now.

727
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,214
And even if the victim called
for an ambulance

728
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:38,799
when he first felt the symptoms

729
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:42,261
and if he lived in a great
big country house like we do,

730
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:46,265
the ambulance would take
at least 15 minutes to arrive

731
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,016
and then it'd be too late.

732
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:52,563
If the victim didn't have
the emergency Naxostuff.

733
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:54,815
Marta?

734
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:58,944
- Do you have the Naxostuff?
- Yes, I'm gonna find it.

735
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:03,740
I have it because it comes with the kit,
so it should be here. It has to be.

736
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:05,576
It's like...

737
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:16,753
It's not here, Harlan.

738
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:19,173
I don't know why it's not here.

739
00:38:19,256 --> 00:38:20,841
So, I'm gonna use the phone, okay?

740
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,010
To call an ambulance.

741
00:38:36,607 --> 00:38:37,941
What are you doing?

742
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,028
What are you doing?

743
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,948
Marta, listen to me.

744
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:47,367
- Harlan, I need to call the ambulance.
- Stop this, Marta!

745
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,245
- There's no time! You have to listen!
- I'm calling the family!

746
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:56,668
What are you doing?

747
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:58,170
Are you nuts?

748
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:01,965
- Harlan, we have to call the ambulance.
- Listen to me. Listen to me!

749
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,510
Now, if what you said is true, I'm gone.
There's no saving me.

750
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:06,595
No, no.

751
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,055
We have six minutes.

752
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:10,974
- No, I can't--
- We have got to get you out of this!

753
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:12,434
Think of your mom.

754
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:13,936
My mom?

755
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:17,356
Marta, get behind me, get behind me.

756
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:18,523
Don't make a noise.

757
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:20,651
Harlan?

758
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,611
Marta?

759
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,154
Everything all right?

760
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:26,782
- Oh, hi, Joni.
- I thought I-- Hi.

761
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,784
I thought I heard something.
Is everything okay?

762
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,702
No, no. We're fine. We're fine.

763
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:34,873
Well, I just knocked over this Go board.
Sorry about that.

764
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:36,708
- Everyone's all right?
- Yeah, fine.

765
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:39,086
No, no. Go to bed, Joni.

766
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:40,796
Okay.

767
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,173
Maybe we can talk tomorrow
about the family...

768
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:44,633
Tomorrow's fine.

769
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,594
- Good night. Love you. Night.
- Love you. Bye.

770
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:51,974
Come on.

771
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:54,685
Pay attention, now.

772
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,814
Your mom is still undocumented.

773
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,440
And if this is your fault,

774
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:03,068
she'll be found out and at best deported,

775
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,153
and your family will be broken.

776
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:08,240
We're not gonna let that happen,
are we, huh?

777
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:10,492
But you have to do exactly
what I tell you.

778
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:12,953
Will you do this, Marta?

779
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:15,789
This last thing...

780
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:18,834
for me, for your family?

781
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:24,172
What do you want me to do?

782
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:28,802
<i>Go downstairs as noisily as you can</i>

783
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,345
<i>and then say goodbye loudly.</i>

784
00:40:30,429 --> 00:40:31,555
Walt, I'm leaving.

785
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:34,308
- <i>Call attention to the time...</i>
- God, it's midnight already.

786
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:35,517
<i>...if you can.</i>

787
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,520
<i>Drive out the gate.</i>

788
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,480
<i>Then to avoid the security cameras,</i>

789
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:43,567
<i>pull off the road
before the carved elephant.</i>

790
00:40:44,818 --> 00:40:48,322
- Wait. Was it before or after?
- <i>After the carved elephant.</i>

791
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,449
No, he said before. Was it?

792
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:53,243
- <i>Beafterfore the carved elephant.</i>
- Oh, shit.

793
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:00,500
<i>Park, and come back
on foot up to the house.</i>

794
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:04,338
<i>Take the side yard pass
through the little gate.</i>

795
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:07,090
<i>The dogs will know you.
They shouldn't bark.</i>

796
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:12,512
<i>You've got to get up to the third floor
without being seen.</i>

797
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,848
<i>And the only way
is to climb the side trellis</i>

798
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,309
<i>and come in through the trick hall window.</i>

799
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,102
You gotta be kidding me.

800
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:20,896
<i>I am not. Do it.</i>

801
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,824
<i>And for God's sake, don't make any noise!</i>

802
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:45,879
<i>Once you're inside,
and this is the tricky part...</i>

803
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,297
<i>This is the tricky part?</i>

804
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:50,801
<i>Get my robe and cap from my bedroom</i>

805
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:52,302
<i>and put them on.</i>

806
00:41:52,386 --> 00:41:53,428
<i>Harlan...</i>

807
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:55,347
This is crazy.
I don't think I can do that.

808
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,308
No, we need to make this so airtight
that the average cop

809
00:41:58,392 --> 00:42:00,811
will entirely dismiss you as a suspect.

810
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:03,105
It sounds crazy, but it'll work.

811
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,570
<i>Walt is smoking outside, and he'll see you</i>

812
00:42:11,655 --> 00:42:13,115
<i>through the glazed window.</i>

813
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:15,283
Dad? Go back to bed.

814
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,203
<i>You were seen leaving.</i>

815
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,747
<i>The security cameras show you driving off.</i>

816
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:22,457
<i>And 20 minutes later,</i>

817
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:25,460
<i>I'm seen alive and well by my son.</i>

818
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:29,047
<i>You see,
you've gone from suspect number one</i>

819
00:42:29,131 --> 00:42:30,924
<i>to an impossibility.</i>

820
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,509
<i>Leave the way you came</i>

821
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:35,762
<i>and don't be seen.</i>

822
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:47,649
Ransom?

823
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,153
Are you back again already?

824
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:55,949
<i>Drive home.</i>

825
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:00,328
<i>And sometime in the next few days,
the police will question you.</i>

826
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:03,039
No. No, no, no.

827
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:04,666
No, I can't lie!

828
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,252
You know I can't lie! I'll puke!

829
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:10,088
Well, then don't lie.
Tell fragments of the truth.

830
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:11,548
In this exact order.

831
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:20,307
I took him upstairs.

832
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,727
We played our nightly game of Go.

833
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:27,981
At some point, he knocked the board over

834
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:30,984
and Joni came up to check on us.

835
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:36,323
I gave him pain medication.

836
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,910
He pulled his shoulder last week.

837
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:43,830
And I left him in his study.

838
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:45,832
At midnight

839
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:47,083
I said goodbye to Walt...

840
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:50,462
went home.

841
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,005
What kind of medication did you give him?

842
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,472
Since his injury, I've been giving him
100 milligram IV push of Toradol.

843
00:44:00,931 --> 00:44:02,599
It's a non-narcotic analgesic.

844
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:05,018
And to help him sleep,

845
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,229
three milligrams of morphine.

846
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:09,022
And the family was aware of this?

847
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:10,774
Yes, of course.

848
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:14,611
Did you notice anything strange
or off about his demeanor?

849
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:19,616
No.

850
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,455
Well, that sounds about right.

851
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:28,291
Thank you, Miss Cabrera.

852
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:50,647
Hey, sis, people are gonna get here
for the memorial pretty soon.

853
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,731
Are you--

854
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:55,986
Are you all right?

855
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,822
I was just thinking about Dad's games.

856
00:45:00,991 --> 00:45:02,492
This all feels like one.

857
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:06,079
Like something he'd write, not do.

858
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,916
I keep waiting for the big reveal.

859
00:45:11,793 --> 00:45:13,295
Where it'll make sense.

860
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:15,547
Wouldn't that be nice?

861
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:17,841
Oh, Walt.

862
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:22,846
<i>I don't think he killed himself.</i>

863
00:45:23,597 --> 00:45:25,599
I don't. I really don't.

864
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:27,183
There's this Hallmark movie

865
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:29,561
called <i>Deadly by Surprise</i>
with Danica McKellar.

866
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:33,607
And in it, she plays this wife
who's getting poisoned by her husband,

867
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,276
but he's doing it little by little,
so she doesn't know it

868
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,778
and she goes crazy, and she kills herself.

869
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:42,324
And my cousin, who's a receptionist
at the medical examiner's office,

870
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,367
she says that stuff totally happens.

871
00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:47,621
It's not even 3% as crazy as
the stuff she's seen come through there.

872
00:45:47,704 --> 00:45:48,747
So, I'm just like...

873
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:51,958
Oh, God, yeah!

874
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:54,169
I mean, don't like him
because you love him.

875
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:57,005
No, I don't like him. He's an asshole.

876
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:59,299
But maybe an asshole is what we needed.

877
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:00,967
Oh, my God, yeah,

878
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:02,636
an asshole is what Germany needed

879
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:04,554
- in 1930-whatever.
- Here we go.

880
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:06,681
Come on, Joni, those two things
don't even conflate.

881
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:09,142
- There is the problem right there.
- Jesus.

882
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:12,270
I'm gonna disappear
until the politics talk is done.

883
00:46:12,354 --> 00:46:13,772
You want some champers?

884
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:16,232
I can't. I'm technically working.

885
00:46:16,316 --> 00:46:19,444
Why don't you take off your red cap,
Richard, and look around you?

886
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,363
The streets are literally
flooded with Nazis.

887
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:22,822
No, no, no. No, no, no.

888
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:25,950
We are losing our way of life
and our culture.

889
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:27,577
- That's right.
- There are millions

890
00:46:27,661 --> 00:46:29,245
- of Mexicans coming.
- Oh, God, really?

891
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:31,623
Don't make this a race thing.
You always make this a race thing.

892
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:34,125
I would say the same thing
if they were European immigrants.

893
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:36,336
Oh, yeah? So, if the Swiss were, like,

894
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,380
- clogging in the streets--
- No, we allow them in

895
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:40,715
and they think they own what's ours.

896
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:43,927
They're putting children in cages!
I mean, these are camps!

897
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:46,513
Come on, Joni,
nobody's saying that isn't bad,

898
00:46:46,596 --> 00:46:48,807
but the parents have some blame here.

899
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:51,309
Oh, for what? For wanting
a better life for their kids?

900
00:46:51,393 --> 00:46:54,187
- Isn't that what America is--
- For breaking the law!

901
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,773
- My God.
- You're gonna hate hearing this,

902
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,734
- but it's true, America is for Americans.
- Don't point at me.

903
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:02,487
- Where's Marta? Is she still here? Marta!
- Oh, God, don't.

904
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:03,863
- Come on over.
- No, Richard.

905
00:47:03,947 --> 00:47:06,408
- Come on over, Marta. Please.
- You're shitting me.

906
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:07,784
Marta,

907
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:11,746
your family is from Uruguay,
but you did it right.

908
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:14,249
I mean, what I'm saying is
they did it legally.

909
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,209
She did it the right way.

910
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:20,213
You work hard, and you'll earn your share
from the ground up.

911
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:24,342
Just like Dad and like all the rest of us.
And I'll bet you agree with me, right?

912
00:47:24,426 --> 00:47:26,886
Oh, just leave the poor girl alone,
Richard.

913
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:29,472
It's okay! I just wanna hear
what she has to say!

914
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:30,807
It's okay, Marta, you can speak.

915
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,726
Sweetheart, don't feel
pressure to answer. This is just--

916
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:33,643
Look.

917
00:47:33,727 --> 00:47:36,521
- Please don't.
- If you wanna become an American,

918
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:39,065
there are legal ways to do it.

919
00:47:39,149 --> 00:47:43,027
But if you break the law,
it doesn't matter how good your heart is,

920
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:45,780
you gotta face the consequences!

921
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:47,365
Are you goddamn insane?

922
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:49,659
- It's done.
- Hey! I'm warning you.

923
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:58,918
That's when I ask her, "Tonya,
what is wrong with people?" Literally.

924
00:47:59,586 --> 00:48:01,963
Oh, my God! Marta, what?

925
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,339
Marta?

926
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:04,507
What's the matter?

927
00:48:04,591 --> 00:48:06,760
Whoa, whoa. Hey. Breathe.

928
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:08,803
- Oh, my gosh.
- Marta, are you okay?

929
00:48:09,846 --> 00:48:12,056
Hey, Fran, do you still have your stash?

930
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:19,022
Take 'em whenever you need 'em.

931
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:21,566
They're just drying out
since you gave me that Juul.

932
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:23,026
Thanks, Fran.

933
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:24,903
- Hey. Hey.
- I'm sorry.

934
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:25,987
- No, just--
- I'm sorry.

935
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,322
I'm very, very sorry.

936
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,574
- Stop saying you're sorry. Jesus!
- I hate this.

937
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:32,285
Oh, God, my heart won't stop. I can't--

938
00:48:33,787 --> 00:48:35,622
It's just everything--No, thank you.

939
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,502
That's where Fran keeps her stash?

940
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:43,755
Who's gonna open a clock?

941
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,841
Do you want dinner, Nana?

942
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:49,093
Dinner? To eat?

943
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:51,471
- To eat?
- Walt.

944
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,056
- Nana?
- Walt, Walt, she's fine.

945
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:55,308
She ate the entire salmon spread already.

946
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:59,729
Walt? Did you tell Marta yet,
what we all talked about?

947
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,606
No, not yet. Is now a good time?

948
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,650
Yes. Yes, a very good time, right now.

949
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:05,109
Oh, okay.

950
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:07,195
All right. Calm down.

951
00:49:09,531 --> 00:49:10,657
Marta,

952
00:49:11,241 --> 00:49:13,701
we've been talking it over and...

953
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:17,830
- Have you been smoking grass?
- No.

954
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:19,916
Come on.

955
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:21,626
Marta, we've been talking it over,

956
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,753
and the whole family,

957
00:49:24,254 --> 00:49:26,047
we'd like to take care of you.

958
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:28,841
Wha-- What does that mean?

959
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:32,095
We all think that you deserve something.

960
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:34,222
Financially we'd like to help you out.

961
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:37,016
You were never anything but good to Dad

962
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:39,477
and because of that we...

963
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,896
You can count on us.

964
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:43,898
Yeah.

965
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,653
I thought you should've been
at the funeral.

966
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:50,655
By the way, I was outvoted.

967
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:02,875
Detective.

968
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,086
You're still here?

969
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,052
Did you know Harlan?

970
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:16,889
He knew my father,
who was a police detective years ago.

971
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:21,019
My father respected Harlan.

972
00:50:21,728 --> 00:50:23,563
That says quite a lot.

973
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:24,981
Is that why you're here?

974
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:28,151
Here now, here?

975
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:29,652
No.

976
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,405
I stayed hoping to speak to you
a little more.

977
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:40,955
Something is afoot with this whole affair.

978
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:43,499
I know it.

979
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,960
I believe you know it, too.

980
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:49,047
So you're gonna keep digging?

981
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:53,259
Harlan's detectives, they dig.

982
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:55,637
They rifle and root.

983
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:57,347
Truffle pigs.

984
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:03,019
I anticipate the terminus
of <i>Gravity's Rainbow.</i>

985
00:51:03,895 --> 00:51:05,063
<i>Gravity's Rainbow?</i>

986
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:06,939
It's a novel.

987
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:08,316
Yeah, I know.

988
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:10,902
- I haven't read it though.
- Neither have I.

989
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:13,655
Nobody has. But I like the title.

990
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:19,285
It describes the path of a projectile
determined by natural law.

991
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:21,704
<i>Et voilá,</i> my method.

992
00:51:21,788 --> 00:51:25,917
I observe the facts
without biases of the head or heart.

993
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,088
I determine the arc's path,
stroll leisurely to its terminus,

994
00:51:30,672 --> 00:51:33,257
and the truth falls at my feet.

995
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:39,097
The medical examiner was ready
to rule this a suicide,

996
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,183
but Elliott agreed to keep it pending
for 48 hours.

997
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:45,186
Tomorrow morning,
I search the grounds and the house,

998
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:46,813
begin my investigation.

999
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:49,982
I want you to be by my side for it.

1000
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:51,567
- What?
- My confidante.

1001
00:51:51,651 --> 00:51:54,445
- My eyes and ears.
- Hey. Wait, wait, Detective. Why me?

1002
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:57,198
I trust your kind heart.

1003
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:01,869
Also, you're the only one who had nothing
to gain from Harlan's death.

1004
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:04,872
So how about it, Watson?

1005
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,166
Hey, Detective?

1006
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,460
If you want my insight into the family...

1007
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:12,255
None of them are murderers.

1008
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:14,132
That's my insight.

1009
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:15,383
And yet,

1010
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:18,010
be it cruel or comforting,

1011
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:22,098
this machine unerringly
arrives at the truth.

1012
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:24,600
That's what it does.

1013
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:27,145
Always?

1014
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:29,522
Tomorrow at 8:00.

1015
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:03,389
<i>I know I've missed something.
There's gonna be something I missed.</i>

1016
00:53:03,473 --> 00:53:05,808
<i>-Harlan. No, I can't.
- But I know you can do this.</i>

1017
00:53:05,892 --> 00:53:08,978
Without losing your soul,
you have to do what you have to do...

1018
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:10,563
- No.
- ...to beat this and win.

1019
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:11,856
Harlan, I can't.

1020
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:13,983
- You can. And you have to.
- No.

1021
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:16,527
For me.

1022
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:17,904
Right now!

1023
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:39,509
Harlan, I have to get you help.

1024
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:42,261
You do as I say...

1025
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:46,140
and everything will be just fine.

1026
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:47,433
No.

1027
00:53:47,517 --> 00:53:49,268
- No.
- I promise.

1028
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,230
But--

1029
00:53:52,230 --> 00:54:22,230
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

1030
00:55:00,298 --> 00:55:03,426
Fifty years ago, I worked this estate.

1031
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:06,345
You know, security back then was such that

1032
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:12,018
you had to make the rounds with a 94
and keep your ears open.

1033
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:16,647
Now you've got all this modern technology.

1034
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:19,650
Now, that's the video there.

1035
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:22,069
I saved the tape from that night.

1036
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:25,948
Normally, I erase 'em
with a magnetic degausser,

1037
00:55:26,032 --> 00:55:29,118
but in this case,
I thought I'd just save it, you know?

1038
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:30,786
For security.

1039
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:33,414
Now, that's a live feed there.

1040
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:37,043
<i>To avoid the security cameras,</i>

1041
00:55:37,126 --> 00:55:39,712
<i>pull off the road
after the carved elephant.</i>

1042
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,964
All right, well,
can we see the actual tape?

1043
00:55:42,048 --> 00:55:43,883
Well, of course you can.

1044
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:46,135
I recorded it SSLP.

1045
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:47,970
There's eight hours in that tape.

1046
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:50,264
9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.

1047
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:02,068
Looks like a Japanese horror movie.

1048
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:04,195
You think we could scan forward on that?

1049
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:05,738
Are we all gonna die in seven days?

1050
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:06,906
How can we scan forward?

1051
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:09,533
Oh, yeah, just hold the play button down

1052
00:56:09,617 --> 00:56:12,912
and press FF until you hear it grind.

1053
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:20,920
All right. Should be coming up now

1054
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:22,463
to the time when the party ended.

1055
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,343
What happened?

1056
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:29,679
You gotta keep holding it down
or else it'll eject.

1057
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:32,056
That thing eats tapes like popcorn.

1058
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:35,601
You think your guys can digitize this
so we could scan it properly?

1059
00:56:35,685 --> 00:56:36,936
Yeah, I think we can do that.

1060
00:56:38,104 --> 00:56:39,146
I got it.

1061
00:56:41,524 --> 00:56:43,818
You know all these statues
that you see around here?

1062
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:47,154
They're all straight out of his series,
<i>The Menagerie Tragedy Trilogy.</i>

1063
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:49,156
- Pretty cool.
- Awesome.

1064
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,658
Yeah.

1065
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,785
Benny, it's beautiful out here,

1066
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:55,746
but do you really think someone broke
into the house and murdered Harlan?

1067
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:58,165
- Is that why we're out here?
- It is unlikely,

1068
00:56:58,249 --> 00:57:00,751
but if they did, there will be traces.

1069
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:03,379
- I can hang on to that.
- Yeah.

1070
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:14,181
Hey, Wagner, you got any luck on...

1071
00:57:15,349 --> 00:57:17,184
- Uh, what's-his-name?
- Ransom?

1072
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:19,061
- Yeah.
- No.

1073
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:21,480
Did get an address though.

1074
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:24,817
- Yeah?
- 10 Kenoak Street.

1075
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:27,486
10... Kenoak?

1076
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,071
Kenoak.

1077
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,408
It's a pleasant thing to say, isn't it?

1078
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:34,160
Kenoak.

1079
00:57:34,243 --> 00:57:36,954
I awoke amid Kenoak.

1080
00:57:37,872 --> 00:57:40,207
- That's funny. Ken-oh-kia.
- All these leaves and mud,

1081
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:42,835
they're really gonna do
a number on my boots, man.

1082
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:46,130
Mud. Did it rain the past week
or something?

1083
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:47,548
- No, stay there!
- What?

1084
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:48,716
Whoa!

1085
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,884
Okay.

1086
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,802
We got footprints here, so, uh...

1087
00:57:51,886 --> 00:57:53,179
I wanna, um...

1088
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:54,972
Marta.

1089
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:56,682
- Stop.
- What?

1090
00:57:56,766 --> 00:57:57,850
What?

1091
00:57:57,933 --> 00:57:59,226
Marta, stay there.

1092
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,395
- What?
- No, Marta! Stay there, Marta.

1093
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:02,855
- No! No!
- I couldn't hear. If you--

1094
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,190
- Did you call me?
- All right.

1095
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:05,983
- Excuse me. Come here.
- All right.

1096
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:08,319
We're gonna need to call the boys,
have 'em come down here,

1097
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,779
take a look at all these tracks.

1098
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:12,114
- Get it taped off. Stay on that side.
- I'm sorry.

1099
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:13,949
- Watch out.
- Okay.

1100
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:16,285
Hey! Yeah!

1101
00:58:17,203 --> 00:58:18,621
Hussie? Hussie, hey.

1102
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:22,124
Best judge of character is a dog.

1103
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:24,794
- Good boy.
- I've found that to be true.

1104
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:28,255
I'd...

1105
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:30,591
Yes!

1106
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:32,927
My puppies!

1107
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:36,680
Yeah, well, they've got plans
to read the will at around 10:00,

1108
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:39,058
so the whole family will be here soon.

1109
00:58:41,644 --> 00:58:44,188
- I've never been to a will reading.
- Oh, well...

1110
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,941
You think it'd be like a game show,

1111
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:51,237
but think of a community theater
production of a tax return.

1112
00:58:52,947 --> 00:58:54,782
So, what are we looking for?

1113
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,033
Oh, you know,

1114
00:58:56,117 --> 00:58:58,786
anything suspicious
or out of the ordinary.

1115
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:00,746
You'll know it when you see it.

1116
00:59:01,622 --> 00:59:02,623
Oh, my God.

1117
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:05,459
Sweet beans!

1118
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:10,714
Well...

1119
00:59:11,674 --> 00:59:13,259
Good morning, Mrs. Thrombey.

1120
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:24,103
You think you could handle the study?

1121
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:36,407
Where's your medical bag?

1122
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,576
I don't know. I left it here.

1123
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:40,369
I always leave it here
with Harlan at night.

1124
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:43,330
They must have taken it in as evidence.
I'll look into that.

1125
00:59:49,003 --> 00:59:50,254
Shit.

1126
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,217
How'd the Go board get knocked over?

1127
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:57,178
We were just goofing around.

1128
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:00,097
What are you thinking?

1129
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:18,199
No! No, no, no! Hey! Hey! Hey!

1130
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:19,575
Oh, let me guess.

1131
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,702
Hey! Stop. Stop.

1132
01:00:22,411 --> 01:00:23,412
Stop. Stop.

1133
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,040
Hugh Drysdale?

1134
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:29,668
Ransom. Call me Ransom.
It's my middle name.

1135
01:00:29,752 --> 01:00:31,295
Only the help calls me Hugh.

1136
01:00:32,213 --> 01:00:34,548
- Okay.
- This is Trooper Wagner.

1137
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:36,258
I'm Lieutenant Elliott.

1138
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:38,636
We just wanna ask a few questions.

1139
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:44,058
Excuse me?

1140
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:46,185
Sir?

1141
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:47,770
We're officers of the law!

1142
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:51,148
You gonna run me in?
I don't feel like talking. I'm distraught.

1143
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:53,734
Hey, Benny, you wanna ask
this guy some questions?

1144
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:56,445
- What is this? What's this arrangement?
- Mr. Drysdale.

1145
01:00:57,363 --> 01:00:59,114
CSI KFC?

1146
01:01:04,203 --> 01:01:07,206
Hey, Frannie,
how about a glass of cold milk?

1147
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:08,666
Hey, asshole.

1148
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:10,251
Not her name, not her job.

1149
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:13,045
Hey, Meg. How's the SJW degree coming?

1150
01:01:13,796 --> 01:01:16,840
- Trust fund prick.
- All right, guys.

1151
01:01:16,924 --> 01:01:18,175
Hey.

1152
01:01:18,259 --> 01:01:19,885
Hey. Everyone.

1153
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:22,680
I'm just gonna be
in the other room, setting up.

1154
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:24,181
Be ready in ten minutes.

1155
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:33,816
Funny, Ransom, you skipped the funeral,
but you're early for the will reading.

1156
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:38,946
Okay, people grieve in different ways.
Let's not...

1157
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,823
You know what?
It's funny you're here at all.

1158
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:43,534
Why are you even bothering?
That's what I'm asking myself.

1159
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:45,119
What's that supposed to mean?

1160
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:46,787
He knows what it's supposed to mean.

1161
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,789
Wait-- Walt, what?

1162
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:53,752
Jacob was in that bathroom
the night of the party.

1163
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:57,423
That's where you were all night?

1164
01:01:57,506 --> 01:02:00,134
What the hell were you doing
in the bathroom all night?

1165
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,885
- Nothing.
- Swatting Syrian refugees?

1166
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:04,138
- No, I was not.
- Alt-right troll.

1167
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:05,264
Liberal snowflake.

1168
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:06,974
I don't know what any of that means.

1169
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:08,684
It means your son's a little creep.

1170
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,353
My son's a creep?

1171
01:02:11,437 --> 01:02:12,438
Guys, just--

1172
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:14,273
Walt, he was in the bathroom.

1173
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:15,774
Yeah, he was in the bathroom.

1174
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:18,569
Joylessly masturbating
to pictures of dead deer.

1175
01:02:19,695 --> 01:02:22,323
You know what, Richard? You wanna go?

1176
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:24,158
You bet, skippy, let's go.

1177
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:25,409
You wanna go? Come on!

1178
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:26,869
You better watch out, man.

1179
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:29,455
- No!
- Stop!

1180
01:02:29,538 --> 01:02:32,291
Come on, I have been waiting
for this my whole life!

1181
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:34,626
- Stop it, right now!
- Donna, I can handle myself!

1182
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:36,003
- Stop it!
- I can handle it.

1183
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:37,212
Oh, my God.

1184
01:02:38,047 --> 01:02:39,631
We gotta do this more often.

1185
01:02:39,715 --> 01:02:40,716
Hey!

1186
01:02:41,342 --> 01:02:42,343
Jacob.

1187
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:44,219
We know where this is going.

1188
01:02:44,303 --> 01:02:46,305
You were in the bathroom
next to Harlan's office,

1189
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:48,057
where he had the fight with Ransom.

1190
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:49,641
Now, you heard something.

1191
01:02:49,725 --> 01:02:50,809
Spill it.

1192
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:54,521
I just heard two things.

1193
01:02:58,192 --> 01:02:59,193
...my will.

1194
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:00,778
"My will."

1195
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:04,031
And then there was more yelling.

1196
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:07,076
And then I heard Ransom say...

1197
01:03:08,202 --> 01:03:09,370
"I'm warning you."

1198
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:14,541
Ransom...

1199
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:16,919
What's that mean?

1200
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:19,338
I think it means our father
finally came to his senses

1201
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:22,383
and cut this worthless little brat
out of his will.

1202
01:03:22,883 --> 01:03:25,302
So I guess you're gonna have
to sell the Beemer

1203
01:03:25,386 --> 01:03:29,306
and give your notice at the country club
and kick whatever fashion drug you're on.

1204
01:03:29,765 --> 01:03:32,976
Because if you think
that after all the bridges you've burned,

1205
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,186
after all the shit you said,

1206
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:36,563
after everything that you put
this family through

1207
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:37,940
for the last ten years,

1208
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:40,234
that any of us are gonna support you,

1209
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:44,405
that any of us are gonna give you,
like Dad liked to say,

1210
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,782
"a single red dime,"

1211
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:48,033
you're nuts!

1212
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:50,744
Wow.

1213
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:53,622
Son...

1214
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:55,707
Father.

1215
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:59,920
Did Harlan tell you
he was gonna cut you out of the will?

1216
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,881
Yep.

1217
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:10,305
Well, then he's done
what none of us were strong enough to do.

1218
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:15,144
Maybe this might finally make you grow up.

1219
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:20,607
This might be the best thing
that could ever happen to you.

1220
01:04:20,691 --> 01:04:23,193
Thank you.
My mother, ladies and gentlemen.

1221
01:04:23,277 --> 01:04:25,320
Look, this is not gonna be easy for you,

1222
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:27,281
but it'll be good.

1223
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,158
Nothing good is ever easy.

1224
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:30,909
Up your ass, Joni.

1225
01:04:30,993 --> 01:04:33,328
You've had your teeth
in this family's tit for a long time.

1226
01:04:33,412 --> 01:04:35,372
"Up your ass"? Oh, very nice.

1227
01:04:35,456 --> 01:04:37,499
- Matter of fact, eat shit.
- Oh, my God, Ransom.

1228
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:38,667
- What?
- How's that?

1229
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,502
Please do not use that word
in front of my son.

1230
01:04:40,586 --> 01:04:42,421
- In fact, eat shit. Eat shit.
- If I wasn't practicing--

1231
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:43,755
- Eat shit.
- You entitled prick!

1232
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:45,215
I would slap that smug smile--

1233
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:47,217
- Definitely eat shit.
- ...off your goddamn face!

1234
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:49,011
Eat shit. You can all eat shit.

1235
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:53,682
I'm not eating one iota of shit!

1236
01:04:55,434 --> 01:04:58,228
What was that about
will readings being boring?

1237
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,814
The exception that proves the rule.

1238
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:04,443
Asshole.

1239
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:07,362
"I'm warning you."

1240
01:05:07,988 --> 01:05:10,157
Ransom said, "I'm warning you."

1241
01:05:10,574 --> 01:05:13,535
Well, you heard Ransom in there.
That's the kind of thing he says.

1242
01:05:14,036 --> 01:05:15,787
You want this? You want this?

1243
01:05:20,292 --> 01:05:22,085
What do we have here?

1244
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:31,261
This looks like a relatively fresh break.

1245
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:33,388
Yep. Right there.

1246
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:35,182
Wait a minute.

1247
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:37,601
Well, that doesn't make sense.

1248
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:39,811
Where's that window?

1249
01:05:40,354 --> 01:05:42,564
How about some more cookies, Hugh?

1250
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:44,441
- You want some more cookies?
- That's great.

1251
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:49,988
Hey, maybe Harlan left you
a cold glass of milk in his will. Asshole.

1252
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:53,992
Show me. But stay off the carpet.

1253
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,050
It's the trick window

1254
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:12,928
from <i>A Kill For All Seasons.</i>

1255
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:14,805
Trooper, here, will you? Take this.

1256
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,570
Traces of dried mud.

1257
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:32,906
I suspect they go
the length of the hallway.

1258
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:34,908
Footprints?

1259
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:36,952
No, just traces.

1260
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:39,413
Yeah, depending on when
this thing was last cleaned,

1261
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:43,000
this could have happened
at any time, right?

1262
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:45,127
No, that would not explain this.

1263
01:06:46,837 --> 01:06:48,046
Analyze that mud.

1264
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:49,756
It will match these traces.

1265
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,593
- Take this to Jamie.
- You will find similar samples

1266
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:54,720
leading up the trellis
on the outside of the house.

1267
01:06:55,596 --> 01:06:57,055
On the night of the party,

1268
01:06:57,139 --> 01:06:59,808
somebody who did not want
to be heard climbing those steps

1269
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:03,353
went to a great deal of trouble
to break into Harlan Thrombey's rooms.

1270
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,190
The game is afoot, eh, Watson?

1271
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:20,996
Well, thank you all
for getting together like this.

1272
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,332
It isn't legally necessary,

1273
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:26,543
but I thought because you're all in town,
and some of you are leaving soon--

1274
01:07:26,627 --> 01:07:27,794
Excuse me.

1275
01:07:27,878 --> 01:07:29,338
I'm sorry.

1276
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:33,091
Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to gently request

1277
01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:37,012
that you all stay in town
until the investigation is completed.

1278
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:38,889
Yeah, well, he's gently requesting,

1279
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,515
but I'm gonna have to make that an order.

1280
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:42,559
No one move until we figure this all out.

1281
01:07:43,018 --> 01:07:44,728
- What?
- Can we ask why?

1282
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,396
- Has something changed?
- No.

1283
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,482
No, it hasn't changed?
Or no, we can't ask?

1284
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,108
Mr. Stevens...

1285
01:07:50,192 --> 01:07:51,526
you may continue.

1286
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:53,236
Right. Well...

1287
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:57,532
The other reason I thought
this gathering would be beneficial

1288
01:07:57,616 --> 01:08:02,496
is because Harlan altered his will
a week before he died.

1289
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,206
He sealed it.

1290
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:06,625
He asked me not to submit it to the courts

1291
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:08,251
for probate until after his death.

1292
01:08:08,335 --> 01:08:11,171
So, if anyone is confused about anything,

1293
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:13,548
we're all together, we can talk.

1294
01:08:13,632 --> 01:08:17,719
Although I don't imagine any of it
is going to be that complicated.

1295
01:08:17,803 --> 01:08:19,805
Harlan's assets included...

1296
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:22,265
- The house.
- The house,

1297
01:08:22,349 --> 01:08:24,101
which he owned outright.

1298
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:26,269
- Um...
- $60 million.

1299
01:08:26,353 --> 01:08:30,482
Yes. $60 million in various cash accounts
and investments.

1300
01:08:30,565 --> 01:08:32,025
And of course,

1301
01:08:32,693 --> 01:08:33,694
the real asset,

1302
01:08:34,111 --> 01:08:37,906
sole ownership of Blood Like Wine,
his publishing company.

1303
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:41,535
He also wrote up a statement
when he was making the changes

1304
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:43,203
and he wanted that read first.

1305
01:08:46,164 --> 01:08:48,959
"Dearest Linda, Walter, and Joni,

1306
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:51,670
Some of you may be surprised
by the choice I've made here.

1307
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:54,214
No pleasure was taken in the exclusion.

1308
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:57,175
And its purpose was not to sow
greater discord in the family,

1309
01:08:57,676 --> 01:08:58,885
quite the opposite.

1310
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:02,973
Please accept it with grace
and without bitterness, but do accept it.

1311
01:09:03,557 --> 01:09:05,392
It's for the best. Dad."

1312
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:22,200
Wow. Well, yeah, not too complex at all.

1313
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:23,660
This will be quick.

1314
01:09:25,245 --> 01:09:28,874
"L, Harlan Thrombey,
being of sound mind and body

1315
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:31,126
and yada, yada, yada...

1316
01:09:31,585 --> 01:09:35,714
I hereby direct that all my assets,
both liquid and otherwise,

1317
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:39,342
I leave in their entirety
to Marta Cabrera.

1318
01:09:41,136 --> 01:09:44,014
My entire ownership
of Blood Like Wine publishing,

1319
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:46,892
I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera.

1320
01:09:46,975 --> 01:09:48,935
The copyright of its catalog likewise

1321
01:09:49,019 --> 01:09:51,813
I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera."

1322
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:57,194
What?

1323
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:02,866
- What?
- No.

1324
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:06,119
- That's not... That's-- No.
- No.

1325
01:10:06,203 --> 01:10:08,163
That can't be.
Can I see that please, Alan?

1326
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:09,706
- Yeah. It's right.
- Please.

1327
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:12,083
- This can't be legal.
- It's right.

1328
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:14,252
- You know, he was--
- Oh, my God.

1329
01:10:14,336 --> 01:10:16,671
- Aren't there safeguards?
- There's a mistake.

1330
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:18,048
I don't know what to say.

1331
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:19,174
We're his family, so...

1332
01:10:19,883 --> 01:10:20,842
It's not possible.

1333
01:10:20,926 --> 01:10:22,928
Are there safeguards against this?

1334
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:25,222
Wasn't in his right mind? Something...

1335
01:10:25,764 --> 01:10:28,767
- You know, Alan, listen.
- You know, he was on medication.

1336
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:31,228
Morphine? All right, morphine.

1337
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:32,604
I mean, I don't know.

1338
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:34,397
- She seems like family--
- Alan, you can take

1339
01:10:34,481 --> 01:10:39,027
this piece of paper and shove it
right up your ass, and get out!

1340
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:40,612
And, you cops, too, out.

1341
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:42,239
Out! Right now.

1342
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:44,449
- Hey, Linda?
- No, Richard, we need to talk.

1343
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:47,202
We need to fight this thing.
We're not going anywhere.

1344
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:49,037
I said get out!

1345
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:51,873
We are the Thrombeys, goddamn it!

1346
01:10:51,957 --> 01:10:53,667
This is still our house!

1347
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:02,425
Oh, sorry.

1348
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:06,847
"Likewise the house at 2 Deerborn Drive
and all belongings therein,

1349
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:08,765
I leave to Marta Cabrera."

1350
01:11:10,475 --> 01:11:13,478
Oh, you little bitch!

1351
01:11:13,562 --> 01:11:16,064
- You little bitch!
- Linda?

1352
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:18,525
Did you know about this?
Were you in on this from the beginning?

1353
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:20,443
- This is unbelievable!
- No, I just wanna know.

1354
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:22,279
What were you-- What were you doing?

1355
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:23,780
Were you boinking my father?

1356
01:11:23,864 --> 01:11:25,490
- "Boinking"?
- No, no, no.

1357
01:11:25,574 --> 01:11:27,534
I think everybody just needs
to cool their jets.

1358
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,078
You had sex with my grandpa,
you dirty anchor baby!

1359
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:31,288
Now hold your horses.

1360
01:11:31,371 --> 01:11:32,998
And in the meantime, I'd maybe run.

1361
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:34,541
Wait, wait, wait, Marta?

1362
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:37,127
- Now, would you please--
- You need to talk to us.

1363
01:11:37,586 --> 01:11:38,795
Marta?

1364
01:11:39,254 --> 01:11:42,007
Wait a minute. I totally understand how
you must be feeling right now.

1365
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:43,466
You cannot leave!

1366
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:45,927
I don't know what to say. I don't know.

1367
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:47,929
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Marta, please...

1368
01:11:48,013 --> 01:11:49,723
Marta, listen, darling--

1369
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:53,143
I don't know what's happening.
I don't know why he--

1370
01:11:53,226 --> 01:11:56,271
Guys, I'm also confused. I need to think!

1371
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:58,356
Marta! Are you listening?

1372
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,733
I can't catch up!

1373
01:12:01,526 --> 01:12:03,987
- I understand.
- Richard! Open up that door!

1374
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,906
- You are scaring her!
- I can't open the damn door!

1375
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:07,782
Marta, go. Marta, go.

1376
01:12:07,866 --> 01:12:09,701
Marta, you have to understand.

1377
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:11,786
He is our father!

1378
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:14,873
- Marta, listen to me.
- Don't listen to them. I'm here.

1379
01:12:14,956 --> 01:12:17,000
I'm not on Twitter anymore.

1380
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:20,211
So DM me on Instagram, okay?

1381
01:12:20,295 --> 01:12:21,421
I wanna talk to you.

1382
01:12:26,593 --> 01:12:27,886
Ransom!

1383
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:29,429
What the hell's going on?

1384
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:32,182
I think this could be the best thing
to happen to all of you!

1385
01:12:34,351 --> 01:12:35,810
What does he mean by that?

1386
01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:39,022
Richard, why didn't you stop her?

1387
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:41,900
What am I supposed to do?
Grab the bumper with my teeth?

1388
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:54,663
Okay, seriously, though, what the hell?

1389
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:01,461
Hey. I'll take an extra bowl.

1390
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:02,796
Sure.

1391
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:12,097
You look like you're gonna pass out.
Have you eaten anything today?

1392
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,390
Eat.

1393
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:18,645
This is a nightmare.

1394
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:22,565
So why?

1395
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:26,111
- Why?
- Why?

1396
01:13:27,362 --> 01:13:30,657
Hey. This is everything.

1397
01:13:31,491 --> 01:13:33,410
There's gotta be a bigger reason why,
and you know it.

1398
01:13:33,493 --> 01:13:35,954
Well, how about it had to do more
with you guys than with me?

1399
01:13:38,123 --> 01:13:39,249
Yeah.

1400
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,127
Yeah, it's the only thing
that makes sense.

1401
01:13:47,424 --> 01:13:48,842
Did he tell you anything?

1402
01:13:49,217 --> 01:13:50,593
Only that I wasn't getting a cent.

1403
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:52,971
That's because he wanted you
to build something from the ground up--

1404
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:54,639
"Build something from the ground up."

1405
01:13:54,723 --> 01:13:56,516
My mother built her business
from the ground up

1406
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:58,643
with a million-dollar loan
from my grandfather.

1407
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:01,521
My father owns none of it.
She made him sign a prenup.

1408
01:14:02,022 --> 01:14:03,356
He lives in fear.

1409
01:14:03,815 --> 01:14:06,943
I know that's what my grandfather was
trying to protect me from by doing this

1410
01:14:07,027 --> 01:14:09,988
and I know I shouldn't say this out loud,
but when he told me, I--

1411
01:14:12,157 --> 01:14:13,199
Jesus.

1412
01:14:13,825 --> 01:14:14,993
I could a killed him.

1413
01:14:17,454 --> 01:14:20,498
After I left the party though,
I was driving.

1414
01:14:20,582 --> 01:14:23,376
Nowhere, just in the night,
and I had this...

1415
01:14:25,879 --> 01:14:27,005
clarity.

1416
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:30,759
Like, from here on out,
I was gonna have to fend for myself.

1417
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,552
And that felt...

1418
01:14:34,637 --> 01:14:35,638
good.

1419
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:38,433
The old bastard.

1420
01:14:41,895 --> 01:14:44,606
Marta, I know three things.

1421
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:47,317
One, I know he didn't commit suicide.

1422
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:51,988
- What makes you think that?
- I don't think it.

1423
01:14:52,405 --> 01:14:53,573
I know it.

1424
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:55,575
Because I knew my granddad.

1425
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,577
Maybe you and I were
the only two who knew him,

1426
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,913
so you're not gonna bullshit me
on this because, two...

1427
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:02,874
I know lying makes you puke.

1428
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:06,169
'Cause of that mafia game
last Fourth of July.

1429
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,546
And three...

1430
01:15:10,465 --> 01:15:13,301
I know you just ate
a full plate of baked beans and sausage.

1431
01:15:16,221 --> 01:15:17,222
So...

1432
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:20,767
Look me in the eye

1433
01:15:22,102 --> 01:15:24,312
and tell me what happened
to my grandfather.

1434
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:29,400
- You asshole.
- Marta.

1435
01:15:30,485 --> 01:15:32,153
Tell me everything.

1436
01:15:36,074 --> 01:15:37,951
Alan, there have got to be options here.

1437
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:39,077
No.

1438
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,703
I don't know how many times

1439
01:15:40,787 --> 01:15:43,623
I can repeat the same
two pieces of information.

1440
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:47,001
If Harlan was of sound mind
when he made the changes,

1441
01:15:47,085 --> 01:15:50,255
- and we all confirmed that he was--
- Would a sound mind do this?

1442
01:15:50,338 --> 01:15:51,548
How-- Sound, how?

1443
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:54,050
The very action speaks to unsoundness.

1444
01:15:54,134 --> 01:15:55,426
Not legally. No.

1445
01:15:56,136 --> 01:15:59,931
You not liking what he did
does not speak to testamentary capacity.

1446
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:02,433
What about undue influence?

1447
01:16:02,517 --> 01:16:05,019
Yeah! Undue influence.
How about that? Huh?

1448
01:16:05,103 --> 01:16:06,396
Did you just Google that?

1449
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:09,691
Look, if Marta was manipulating Dad
somehow and if we found out--

1450
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:11,693
If somehow, she had gotten
her hooks into him--

1451
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:14,237
You need a strong case for that.

1452
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:17,240
"Your Honor, she endeared herself to him

1453
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:19,701
through hard work and good humor."

1454
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:21,536
That won't cut the salami.

1455
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:23,538
What about the slayer rule?

1456
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:25,540
I did just Google that.

1457
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:27,792
The slayer rule obviously
doesn't apply here.

1458
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:30,420
Well, what the hell is the slayer rule?

1459
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:33,131
Well, it's if someone is convicted
of killing the person,

1460
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:34,549
they don't get their inheritance.

1461
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:35,633
Not even convicted.

1462
01:16:35,717 --> 01:16:38,136
Even if they're held responsible
for their death in civil court.

1463
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,013
Like O.J.?

1464
01:16:40,597 --> 01:16:42,515
Yes, like O.J.

1465
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:46,019
But Harlan committed suicide.

1466
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:56,696
Detective Blanc?

1467
01:16:56,779 --> 01:16:59,782
You said the investigation is ongoing.
You made a point of that.

1468
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:01,534
Do you suspect foul play?

1469
01:17:01,618 --> 01:17:05,205
Mr. Blanc, if you please...

1470
01:17:06,206 --> 01:17:09,584
There is much that remains unclear,
but yes,

1471
01:17:10,335 --> 01:17:13,296
I suspect foul play.

1472
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:15,715
Marta?

1473
01:17:15,798 --> 01:17:18,635
I have eliminated no suspects.

1474
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:21,638
You're full of shit.

1475
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:23,389
I don't trust this guy in the tweed suit.

1476
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,309
And, Alan, God bless you, you're useless.

1477
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:27,393
Thank you.

1478
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:31,064
There's only one answer to this.
She has to renounce the inheritance.

1479
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:33,691
- She knows it's what she should do.
- That's exactly what she--

1480
01:17:33,775 --> 01:17:34,984
Right? No way.

1481
01:17:35,068 --> 01:17:36,527
It's the moral thing.

1482
01:17:36,611 --> 01:17:38,154
- Mom.
- She'll do it.

1483
01:17:38,238 --> 01:17:40,990
If Granddad wanted to give Marta
everything, that's what he wanted.

1484
01:17:41,074 --> 01:17:42,283
No.

1485
01:17:42,367 --> 01:17:44,535
This wasn't him. He loved us.

1486
01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:46,037
He wanted us taken care of.

1487
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:48,081
He wanted you to have an education.

1488
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:49,540
Meg,

1489
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:52,377
you think I can pay for your school?

1490
01:18:03,054 --> 01:18:04,097
I know.

1491
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,391
Just saying it, it sounds insane,
but it's all true.

1492
01:18:06,766 --> 01:18:09,394
And I think Blanc's been on to me
from the start.

1493
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:11,729
I don't care if I go to jail, but my mom,

1494
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:13,606
my sister?

1495
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:15,024
We--

1496
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:18,778
You gonna say something?

1497
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:23,324
I always thought I was the only one
that could beat him at Go.

1498
01:18:24,492 --> 01:18:26,160
Always thought that meant something.

1499
01:18:27,287 --> 01:18:28,746
Yeah, I know you did.

1500
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:30,039
That night at the party,

1501
01:18:30,623 --> 01:18:32,583
my last conversation with him...

1502
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:35,128
My last argument,
that's what he told me about you.

1503
01:18:36,462 --> 01:18:38,798
That you beat him at Go
more than I do, and I thought...

1504
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:43,344
"What a strange thing to tell me."

1505
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:47,015
Think I get it now.

1506
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:51,144
Maybe it did mean something.

1507
01:18:56,858 --> 01:18:58,735
I'm not gonna tell my family shit.

1508
01:18:58,818 --> 01:19:00,069
You're not gonna go to jail.

1509
01:19:00,153 --> 01:19:02,030
That detective is not gonna catch you.

1510
01:19:02,905 --> 01:19:04,324
And you're not gonna give up the money.

1511
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:06,909
This is what Granddad wanted for you.

1512
01:19:06,993 --> 01:19:08,703
Think about what he did
to go through with this.

1513
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:11,247
He wanted this for himself,
he wanted this for the family.

1514
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:13,624
And he wanted it for you.

1515
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:15,251
You've come this far.

1516
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:18,129
Let me help you go all the way.

1517
01:19:18,212 --> 01:19:20,048
What's going on? This isn't you.

1518
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:23,801
You could just turn me in right now
and still get your cut of the inheritance.

1519
01:19:23,885 --> 01:19:24,927
Why?

1520
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,013
Because fuck my family.

1521
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:30,600
I can help you get away with this.

1522
01:19:30,683 --> 01:19:31,893
And then,

1523
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:34,687
you're gonna give me
my cut of the inheritance.

1524
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:38,191
Happy ending. Everybody wins.

1525
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:40,485
You, me, Harlan.

1526
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:41,694
Yeah.

1527
01:19:43,154 --> 01:19:44,238
Deal?

1528
01:19:56,626 --> 01:19:58,336
- Meg.
- <i>Marta...</i>

1529
01:19:59,379 --> 01:20:00,963
<i>That was nuts.</i>

1530
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:02,131
I know.

1531
01:20:02,215 --> 01:20:03,383
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1532
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:07,053
Yeah. Are you?

1533
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,763
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, I--</i>

1534
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:12,350
<i>Look, no one knows
I'm calling you, I just--</i>

1535
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:13,684
<i>I wanted to...</i>

1536
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:19,107
<i>I wanted to say sorry
for how everyone was.</i>

1537
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:21,275
<i>And...</i>

1538
01:20:22,443 --> 01:20:25,696
I guess, I wanted to ask,
what are you gonna do?

1539
01:20:28,783 --> 01:20:30,118
What do you mean?

1540
01:20:30,201 --> 01:20:31,327
<i>Well, the--</i>

1541
01:20:31,411 --> 01:20:33,496
<i>You know, with the will,
what are you gonna do?</i>

1542
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:38,292
What do you think I should do?

1543
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:43,965
<i>You should do whatever you think is right.</i>

1544
01:20:46,551 --> 01:20:47,677
Look, I--

1545
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,472
I think you should give it back to us.

1546
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:56,060
<i>Granddad always took care of us.</i>

1547
01:20:56,144 --> 01:20:57,687
<i>You know, we're his family.</i>

1548
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:01,482
<i>And I know he was like family to you,
but we're his actual family.</i>

1549
01:21:01,566 --> 01:21:02,567
Yeah.

1550
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:04,485
And look, Marta,

1551
01:21:04,569 --> 01:21:06,445
you know this isn't fair.

1552
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:08,614
We've always been good to you

1553
01:21:08,698 --> 01:21:11,659
<i>and you're like family,
and we'll take care of you,</i>

1554
01:21:11,742 --> 01:21:13,703
<i>but you have to make things right.</i>

1555
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:15,454
<i>You know what's right.</i>

1556
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:17,957
<i>Marta...</i>

1557
01:21:20,668 --> 01:21:21,961
Mom's broke.

1558
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:24,714
<i>And she says I'm gonna have
to drop out of school.</i>

1559
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:26,340
No. No, no, Meg.

1560
01:21:27,884 --> 01:21:29,552
Listen, I won't let that happen.

1561
01:21:29,969 --> 01:21:32,138
<i>Whatever money you need,
I'll give it to you.</i>

1562
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:35,224
<i>I'm here for you. And I want you to know
I'm gonna take care of you,</i>

1563
01:21:35,308 --> 01:21:36,601
<i>I promise that.</i>

1564
01:21:36,684 --> 01:21:37,685
<i>Okay?</i>

1565
01:21:37,768 --> 01:21:39,228
Thanks.

1566
01:21:39,312 --> 01:21:40,354
<i>And once I--</i>

1567
01:21:45,693 --> 01:21:48,905
<i>Sometimes I think it's a sin</i>

1568
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:53,576
<i>When I feel like I'm winnin'
When I'm losin' again</i>

1569
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:01,042
Okay then.

1570
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:04,754
Did Blanc find anything suspicious
at the house?

1571
01:22:06,923 --> 01:22:09,592
Yes, he found mud upstairs.

1572
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:12,220
- Where I broke in through the window.
- Shit.

1573
01:22:12,303 --> 01:22:13,304
Identifiable prints?

1574
01:22:14,013 --> 01:22:16,432
- No.
- Good. Okay.

1575
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:18,392
Good. Hey...

1576
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:22,313
You lay low for a couple days,
wait for this investigation to blow over,

1577
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:23,689
and it will.

1578
01:22:23,773 --> 01:22:26,943
'Cause no matter how good this Blanc guy
thinks he is, he's got nothin'.

1579
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:29,737
Hey, relax.

1580
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:32,949
Marta, get your ass up!

1581
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:35,534
What the hell is happening?
There's a guy here and a bunch of stuff.

1582
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:37,161
Everything's going crazy. Are we rich?

1583
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,873
Maybe, Alice. I don't know.

1584
01:22:40,957 --> 01:22:42,959
I don't know what that means,
but you better get your ass up, okay?

1585
01:22:44,961 --> 01:22:46,837
<i>We don't know much about Marta Cabrera,</i>

1586
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:48,547
- <i>or her exact relationship...</i>
- Oh, my God.

1587
01:22:48,631 --> 01:22:50,091
Marta, what is all this?

1588
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:51,676
What did you do?

1589
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:54,595
- Is that here?
- Oh, yeah, it is.

1590
01:22:55,763 --> 01:22:57,139
Wait, so is that true?

1591
01:22:57,682 --> 01:22:59,016
Are we rich?

1592
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:01,519
<i>This is a story so compelling...</i>

1593
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:02,603
Oh, my God.

1594
01:23:02,687 --> 01:23:04,605
<i>...it is as if he had written
the story himself.</i>

1595
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:19,370
Good morning, Mrs. Thrombey.

1596
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:27,795
Why is grief the providence of youth?

1597
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:30,256
I don't know.

1598
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:37,054
But I'd imagine
that age deepens all feelings.

1599
01:23:38,681 --> 01:23:40,099
Including grief.

1600
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:47,481
This was a long walk
to offering condolences

1601
01:23:48,441 --> 01:23:49,942
for the loss of your son.

1602
01:23:51,402 --> 01:23:53,863
And asking you,
if it isn't presumptuous of me,

1603
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:57,199
not to think too harshly of your family...

1604
01:23:58,284 --> 01:24:03,331
if I am, as I suspect,
the first to console you.

1605
01:24:04,498 --> 01:24:06,959
They're young, aren't they?

1606
01:24:12,340 --> 01:24:15,426
One thing I assume of age

1607
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:17,261
is weariness.

1608
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:21,057
Damned if I don't get
more tired every day.

1609
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:23,309
Tired of what I do.

1610
01:24:23,851 --> 01:24:26,812
Following arcs like lobbed rocks,

1611
01:24:26,896 --> 01:24:29,065
the inevitability of truth.

1612
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:34,153
But the complexity and the gray...

1613
01:24:35,363 --> 01:24:36,989
lie not in the truth...

1614
01:24:38,532 --> 01:24:41,660
but what you do with the truth
once you have it.

1615
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:52,129
I think you have something
you wanna tell me.

1616
01:24:53,964 --> 01:24:56,759
I think you're very perceptive

1617
01:24:56,842 --> 01:24:59,762
and very capable
of telling me what you saw

1618
01:25:00,137 --> 01:25:02,139
the night of your son's party.

1619
01:25:10,481 --> 01:25:12,149
But I'll happily wait.

1620
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:14,402
I'm in no rush.

1621
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:16,904
In fact,

1622
01:25:16,987 --> 01:25:20,658
I find it quite pleasant
sitting here with you.

1623
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:30,126
Lawyers were here.

1624
01:25:30,209 --> 01:25:31,627
Very big lawyers, it looked like.

1625
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,921
They left this stuff and business cards.

1626
01:25:34,004 --> 01:25:36,465
And there was a pile of other stuff
when I got home.

1627
01:25:37,216 --> 01:25:38,884
I don't like any of this, Marta.

1628
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:42,888
I don't like it either.
I'm slipping out the back.

1629
01:25:43,472 --> 01:25:45,891
I'll be back later.
Please don't talk to anyone.

1630
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:53,566
Walt?

1631
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:57,027
Yeah, I came--

1632
01:25:57,111 --> 01:25:58,279
Hey, how you doin'?

1633
01:26:01,157 --> 01:26:03,909
Walt, I want you to know
that I didn't know about any of this.

1634
01:26:03,993 --> 01:26:05,202
- We know you didn't.
- This is--

1635
01:26:05,286 --> 01:26:06,537
We know you didn't.

1636
01:26:07,163 --> 01:26:09,957
Yeah, we all kind of went
a little crazy yesterday.

1637
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,584
- Understandable.
- Yeah.

1638
01:26:13,252 --> 01:26:15,129
I haven't even looked at all this yet.

1639
01:26:15,212 --> 01:26:17,840
It must just be
local lawyers and accountants

1640
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:20,342
who saw the news
and wanna get a jump on it.

1641
01:26:20,426 --> 01:26:22,595
Yeah. I'd be careful of all of it.

1642
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:29,018
Marta, is it your intention
to renounce the inheritance?

1643
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:34,607
This is what Harlan wanted.

1644
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:37,818
Yeah, but...

1645
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:40,738
Harlan put you in
a very hard position here.

1646
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:42,990
I mean... it was unfair of him.

1647
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:45,326
I mean, you see

1648
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:48,662
the kind of press and scrutiny
that this kicks up.

1649
01:26:48,746 --> 01:26:51,582
And we know, with your mother...

1650
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,001
My mother?

1651
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:55,085
Yeah.

1652
01:27:00,591 --> 01:27:02,176
What did Meg tell you?

1653
01:27:03,093 --> 01:27:04,595
This isn't about--

1654
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:07,806
You're missing the point.

1655
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:09,850
We don't wanna attack you with this,

1656
01:27:09,934 --> 01:27:13,854
but, Marta, if your mother
came into the country illegally,

1657
01:27:13,938 --> 01:27:15,105
criminally,

1658
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:16,941
and you've come into this inheritance,

1659
01:27:17,024 --> 01:27:19,026
with all the scrutiny that entails,

1660
01:27:19,109 --> 01:27:20,736
I'd be afraid that could come to light.

1661
01:27:21,445 --> 01:27:23,322
And that's what we wanna avoid here.

1662
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:24,615
We can protect you...

1663
01:27:25,533 --> 01:27:28,410
from that happening, or if it happens.

1664
01:27:28,786 --> 01:27:32,748
So you're saying that
even if it came to light,

1665
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:35,918
with your family's resources,
you could help me fix it?

1666
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:37,336
Yeah.

1667
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:39,505
Yeah, with the right lawyers, you know?

1668
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:40,839
Not these local guys,

1669
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:43,551
but New York lawyers, DC lawyers,

1670
01:27:43,634 --> 01:27:45,886
with enough resources put toward it, yes.

1671
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:49,306
Not that that ever even needs
to come up, but...

1672
01:27:49,807 --> 01:27:50,808
yes.

1673
01:27:52,393 --> 01:27:53,602
Okay, good.

1674
01:27:55,521 --> 01:27:56,522
Okay?

1675
01:27:57,731 --> 01:28:00,985
'Cause Harlan gave me all your resources.

1676
01:28:01,777 --> 01:28:04,697
So that means with my resources,
I'll be able to fix it.

1677
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:06,532
So I guess I will find the right lawyers.

1678
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:08,117
Uh, Marta, that's--

1679
01:28:10,828 --> 01:28:12,496
You better be sure that's...

1680
01:28:13,831 --> 01:28:15,416
what you want.

1681
01:28:32,558 --> 01:28:33,809
No...

1682
01:28:53,329 --> 01:28:56,040
- I don't know-- What's this?
- It's my medical bag tag.

1683
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:58,709
They have my medical bag for some reason.

1684
01:28:59,376 --> 01:29:01,629
Okay, but this is a photocopy
of just the header

1685
01:29:01,712 --> 01:29:04,590
of a blood toxicology report on Harlan.

1686
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:06,800
Marta, this is gonna show
the morphine overdose.

1687
01:29:10,179 --> 01:29:11,180
So I'm screwed?

1688
01:29:13,349 --> 01:29:14,975
How do you know all this stuff?

1689
01:29:15,059 --> 01:29:17,186
I was Harlan's research assistant
for a summer.

1690
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:20,397
But what kind of blackmail scheme is this?

1691
01:29:20,481 --> 01:29:23,901
I mean, the actual evidence is sitting
up the street, at the crime lab.

1692
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:26,195
There's no demands,
there's no meeting place.

1693
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:30,199
What's the point in sending you this?

1694
01:29:40,668 --> 01:29:43,253
It could be a half hour.
It could be an hour. It depends.

1695
01:29:43,337 --> 01:29:44,546
We wanna make sure...

1696
01:29:51,804 --> 01:29:54,598
- So, it could take a while.
- What's the cheese?

1697
01:29:54,682 --> 01:29:56,016
- Oh, hey.
- Yeah.

1698
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,601
- Thank you, Chief.
- No problem.

1699
01:29:57,685 --> 01:29:58,769
5:00 a.m.

1700
01:29:58,852 --> 01:30:00,813
Security systems here are all triggered.

1701
01:30:00,896 --> 01:30:02,690
Now, this thing went up really quick,

1702
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:06,819
so that means blood stores, records,
anything of that nature, it's all gone.

1703
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:09,405
There were no employees here,
so, thank God for that.

1704
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:12,533
What about security cameras?

1705
01:30:13,075 --> 01:30:14,159
Oh, yeah.

1706
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:17,955
Speaking of security,

1707
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:19,915
the surveillance tape
at the Thrombey estate

1708
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:22,209
was all scrambled for some reason.

1709
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:23,377
Yeah.

1710
01:30:24,211 --> 01:30:26,463
What's still pending from the autopsy?

1711
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,507
Just a report on the blood work.

1712
01:30:30,217 --> 01:30:31,427
Blood work?

1713
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:37,725
Holy shit.

1714
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:42,688
This is insane.

1715
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:46,734
I mean, who would blow up
a whole real building

1716
01:30:46,817 --> 01:30:48,193
just to blackmail me?

1717
01:30:48,277 --> 01:30:50,529
Marta, this means the blackmailer
has the only paper copy

1718
01:30:50,612 --> 01:30:52,239
of the thing that can prove your guilt.

1719
01:30:52,322 --> 01:30:55,451
You didn't get any other instructions?
No phone call? No e-mail? Nothing?

1720
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:56,577
No.

1721
01:30:57,494 --> 01:30:59,413
Well, I haven't checked my e-mail.

1722
01:31:04,668 --> 01:31:05,669
There is one.

1723
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:09,757
Yeah, that's it.
"1209 Columbus Road. 10 a.m."

1724
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:18,307
You know what this means, right?
If you destroy that copy,

1725
01:31:18,932 --> 01:31:20,309
you're totally in the clear.

1726
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:22,436
Oh, no.

1727
01:31:23,729 --> 01:31:25,230
Marta, did you hear me?

1728
01:31:27,733 --> 01:31:28,776
Yeah.

1729
01:31:36,909 --> 01:31:38,076
Elliott!

1730
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:39,203
We gotta go! We gotta go!

1731
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:44,458
- Okay, Baby Driver.
- Oh, God.

1732
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:47,211
- You regret helping me yet?
- I regret not taking the Beemer.

1733
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:51,256
Oh, shit.

1734
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:06,897
- Vehicles in pursuit on Washington Street.
- No force.

1735
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:08,357
- Make sure you say "no force."
- No force.

1736
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,567
- We got a possible murder suspect.
- I said that. I said that.

1737
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:14,696
Go. Go! Go! Are you flooring it?

1738
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:16,323
I am literally flooring it!

1739
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:29,211
- This is going well.
- I'm pulling over. I'm--

1740
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:31,797
If you miss your chance
to get this tox report, it's all over.

1741
01:32:32,506 --> 01:32:33,715
Oh, my God.

1742
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:38,512
Whoa!

1743
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:39,972
Why-- Why are we stopping?

1744
01:32:40,055 --> 01:32:42,015
Why are you stopping
in the middle of the road?

1745
01:32:55,028 --> 01:32:56,238
Hold on.

1746
01:33:20,637 --> 01:33:22,848
Oh, my God,
I'm just pure adrenaline right now.

1747
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,725
I feel like I swallowed bees.

1748
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:25,809
Okay.

1749
01:33:25,893 --> 01:33:27,311
So where is it? What's the address?

1750
01:33:27,394 --> 01:33:28,854
1209 Columbus Road.

1751
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:30,731
Okay. I mean, whatever they want,

1752
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:31,899
- I'll say yes--
- Anything.

1753
01:33:31,982 --> 01:33:33,525
You know, just to get that report back.

1754
01:33:33,609 --> 01:33:35,444
- Get it back and destroy it.
- Destroy it.

1755
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:37,237
Holy shit, Ransom.

1756
01:33:38,113 --> 01:33:39,573
Hey, thank you.

1757
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:42,034
I couldn't do this without you.

1758
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:47,289
Oh, my God.

1759
01:33:48,248 --> 01:33:49,291
Get out.

1760
01:33:51,585 --> 01:33:54,171
That was the dumbest car chase
of all time.

1761
01:33:54,713 --> 01:33:56,048
Put your hands down.

1762
01:33:56,131 --> 01:33:58,842
I spoke to Wanetta Thrombey, Greatnana.

1763
01:33:58,926 --> 01:34:02,095
Night of the party, she saw someone
climbing the trellis to the third floor.

1764
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:05,265
- Mr. Drysdale, come on.
- Let's go.

1765
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:08,894
- Pat him down, check him out.
- What's going on?

1766
01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:12,439
- "Ransom came back," she said.
- Hands on the vehicle.

1767
01:34:12,522 --> 01:34:14,858
I don't know what he came back to do,
but we'll find out.

1768
01:34:14,942 --> 01:34:16,151
You got anything sharp?

1769
01:34:17,444 --> 01:34:20,197
- Watch your head. Thank you.
- Hey, you don't need to thank him.

1770
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:23,533
Did he ask you to drive
when he saw me coming?

1771
01:34:25,077 --> 01:34:26,161
Yes.

1772
01:34:33,752 --> 01:34:35,212
Blanc, coming with us?

1773
01:34:35,295 --> 01:34:36,713
I'll drive with Marta.

1774
01:34:37,631 --> 01:34:39,174
Let's go to the police station.

1775
01:34:39,257 --> 01:34:42,678
I want a full rundown
on everything he said to you.

1776
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:44,346
I'll catch you up on where we're at.

1777
01:34:51,478 --> 01:34:54,147
Strange case from the start.

1778
01:34:55,399 --> 01:34:58,402
A case with a hole in the middle.

1779
01:35:00,278 --> 01:35:01,279
A doughnut.

1780
01:35:02,698 --> 01:35:05,117
I'm just talking through my process here.

1781
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,994
Let me know if this is boring.

1782
01:35:07,703 --> 01:35:09,371
I feel the noose tightening.

1783
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:12,332
The family is truly desperate.

1784
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:14,668
Desperate motives.

1785
01:35:15,377 --> 01:35:17,462
The mystery of who hired me.

1786
01:35:17,546 --> 01:35:19,214
The impossibility of the crime.

1787
01:35:20,382 --> 01:35:21,591
And yet...

1788
01:35:22,759 --> 01:35:24,511
A doughnut.

1789
01:35:24,594 --> 01:35:27,139
One central piece.

1790
01:35:27,222 --> 01:35:30,308
And if it reveals itself,
the fog would lift,

1791
01:35:30,392 --> 01:35:34,521
the arc would resolve,
the Slinky become unkinked.

1792
01:35:34,604 --> 01:35:36,565
Do you mind if I stop for a second?

1793
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:38,150
I need to pick something up.

1794
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:39,693
It'll be very quick.

1795
01:35:40,902 --> 01:35:42,070
Sure.

1796
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:56,960
It'll be just a few minutes.

1797
01:35:57,044 --> 01:35:58,253
Watch the...

1798
01:35:59,004 --> 01:36:00,005
door.

1799
01:36:22,486 --> 01:36:23,487
Hello?

1800
01:36:47,385 --> 01:36:49,346
Listen, I don't know what you want.

1801
01:36:52,099 --> 01:36:54,017
Whatever it is, we can work it out.

1802
01:36:54,101 --> 01:36:56,686
But we have to figure it out
right here, right now.

1803
01:36:56,770 --> 01:36:58,438
And I'm leaving with that report.

1804
01:37:03,151 --> 01:37:04,277
Hello?

1805
01:37:29,553 --> 01:37:30,762
Fran?

1806
01:37:40,564 --> 01:37:42,315
No, no, no, no! Fran?

1807
01:37:43,942 --> 01:37:45,193
Oh, my God, Fran.

1808
01:37:45,277 --> 01:37:46,319
Can you hear me?

1809
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:49,239
Fran, give me a sign if you can hear me.

1810
01:37:49,322 --> 01:37:51,491
- You...
- Yes, it's me. It's Marta.

1811
01:37:51,575 --> 01:37:53,451
You called me here, you sent me an e-mail.

1812
01:37:53,535 --> 01:37:55,620
That's why I'm here.
Did you take something?

1813
01:37:55,704 --> 01:37:58,081
I'm gonna call an ambulance now.
You're gonna be okay.

1814
01:37:58,165 --> 01:37:59,875
You're gonna be fine, okay? Stay with me.

1815
01:37:59,958 --> 01:38:01,209
- Copy...
- What?

1816
01:38:01,293 --> 01:38:02,335
Copy...

1817
01:38:03,170 --> 01:38:04,296
Stashed...

1818
01:38:04,379 --> 01:38:05,714
What? What are you saying?

1819
01:38:07,090 --> 01:38:08,633
You did this.

1820
01:38:09,342 --> 01:38:11,386
Won't get away with this.

1821
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:12,679
Jesus, stop it!

1822
01:38:34,993 --> 01:38:36,828
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

1823
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:43,001
<i>The thought of you stays bright</i>

1824
01:38:44,502 --> 01:38:49,216
<i>Sometimes I stand
In the middle of the floor</i>

1825
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,596
<i>Not going left</i>

1826
01:38:55,889 --> 01:38:56,932
<i>Not going...</i>

1827
01:38:57,015 --> 01:38:58,225
Oh, Lord.

1828
01:39:00,435 --> 01:39:02,979
All right, my friend.
Thank you for the update.

1829
01:39:04,147 --> 01:39:05,190
There's no need for that.

1830
01:39:05,273 --> 01:39:08,652
I'll bring her in once we get word
that the housekeeper is stable.

1831
01:39:08,735 --> 01:39:10,028
It's still touch and go.

1832
01:39:10,612 --> 01:39:11,613
All right.

1833
01:39:13,114 --> 01:39:14,199
Listen, this is over.

1834
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:15,784
People are getting hurt.

1835
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:19,746
So I'm gonna tell you the truth.

1836
01:39:19,829 --> 01:39:23,416
Young Ransom just told
Lieutenant Elliott everything.

1837
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:25,043
Good.

1838
01:39:25,126 --> 01:39:27,128
Wait, I hope he didn't cover for me.

1839
01:39:27,212 --> 01:39:28,672
Did he tell you the real truth

1840
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:30,757
- about me switching the--
- Yeah.

1841
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,133
- And the disguise bit?
- Yes.

1842
01:39:32,217 --> 01:39:34,219
And the whole blackmail and--

1843
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:37,430
But why did Fran take my morphine?

1844
01:39:37,514 --> 01:39:39,849
I mean, obviously she had swiped
the bag from the house,

1845
01:39:39,933 --> 01:39:41,893
but she didn't seem like a user to me,

1846
01:39:41,977 --> 01:39:43,979
unless that's why she needed
the blackmail money.

1847
01:39:44,062 --> 01:39:46,356
I don't know. It doesn't matter anyway.

1848
01:39:46,439 --> 01:39:49,109
I have to tell the Thrombeys myself.
I feel like I owe that to them.

1849
01:39:49,192 --> 01:39:50,568
I don't think that's a good idea.

1850
01:39:50,652 --> 01:39:52,988
No, I have to do it. I need to do it.

1851
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:56,408
I gave the doctors my number,

1852
01:39:56,491 --> 01:39:58,285
so they'll call if anything
changes with Fran.

1853
01:39:58,368 --> 01:39:59,369
All right.

1854
01:39:59,452 --> 01:40:02,664
I'll round up the Thrombeys at the house,
along with a police escort.

1855
01:40:03,248 --> 01:40:04,708
For the arrest after.

1856
01:40:05,834 --> 01:40:07,836
You can tell me your whole story
on the drive over.

1857
01:40:09,212 --> 01:40:11,089
I don't want any more surprises.

1858
01:40:26,896 --> 01:40:30,483
Fran said it was stashed,
the copy, and then she said,

1859
01:40:31,067 --> 01:40:33,278
"You did this.
You won't get away with it."

1860
01:40:33,361 --> 01:40:36,031
And I called the ambulance.

1861
01:40:36,698 --> 01:40:37,782
That's it.

1862
01:40:39,075 --> 01:40:40,118
All right.

1863
01:40:42,287 --> 01:40:43,413
You ready?

1864
01:40:50,628 --> 01:40:51,838
Okay.

1865
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:54,049
Well, has she come to her senses?

1866
01:40:54,132 --> 01:40:56,718
Well, she's standing right there, Richard.
She can speak for herself.

1867
01:40:56,801 --> 01:40:58,928
- Is the rest of the family here?
- In the living room.

1868
01:40:59,012 --> 01:41:02,390
I think that it would be better if we were
to gather again and get this over with.

1869
01:41:08,021 --> 01:41:09,439
- Hey.
- Hey.

1870
01:41:11,733 --> 01:41:13,610
I'm so sorry I told them about your mom.

1871
01:41:13,693 --> 01:41:15,362
Meg, it's okay.

1872
01:41:16,237 --> 01:41:18,823
I'm sorry. No-- I was scared.
I just-- I didn't wanna tell them.

1873
01:41:18,907 --> 01:41:20,450
I get it.

1874
01:41:20,533 --> 01:41:21,785
Trust me.

1875
01:41:22,535 --> 01:41:24,579
I understand. It's all right.

1876
01:41:25,705 --> 01:41:26,706
I'm sorry.

1877
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:32,712
God, I am so raiding
Fran's stash after this.

1878
01:41:32,796 --> 01:41:35,298
I still think this is a bad idea,

1879
01:41:35,965 --> 01:41:38,093
but the family is assembled.

1880
01:41:41,471 --> 01:41:43,223
I know where the tox report is.

1881
01:41:50,897 --> 01:41:52,482
She basically told me where it was.

1882
01:41:55,110 --> 01:41:56,945
Anyways, this will tie everything up.

1883
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:00,907
And I just handed it to you.

1884
01:42:02,409 --> 01:42:04,786
God, you're not much
of a detective, are you?

1885
01:42:05,453 --> 01:42:06,996
Well, to be fair...

1886
01:42:08,873 --> 01:42:11,251
you make a pretty lousy murderer.

1887
01:42:13,294 --> 01:42:14,963
Perhaps we deserve each other.

1888
01:42:27,225 --> 01:42:28,810
You've always been good to me.

1889
01:42:30,812 --> 01:42:32,939
And what I'm about to say
isn't gonna be easy

1890
01:42:33,022 --> 01:42:34,524
and you're gonna be upset.

1891
01:42:35,483 --> 01:42:38,278
But I thought after what you've
gone through the last few days,

1892
01:42:39,571 --> 01:42:41,865
that you deserved to hear it from me.

1893
01:42:44,951 --> 01:42:46,202
- I--
- Excuse me!

1894
01:42:50,665 --> 01:42:52,959
You have not been good to her.

1895
01:42:53,751 --> 01:42:55,837
You have all treated her like shit,

1896
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:59,424
to steal back a fortune that you lost
and she deserves.

1897
01:43:00,175 --> 01:43:03,094
You're a pack of vultures at the feast!

1898
01:43:03,178 --> 01:43:04,971
Knives out, beaks bloody!

1899
01:43:05,054 --> 01:43:06,431
Well...

1900
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:09,684
You're not getting bailed out,
not this time.

1901
01:43:10,727 --> 01:43:14,814
Miss Cabrera has decided, definitively,
not to renounce the inheritance.

1902
01:43:15,315 --> 01:43:17,025
- What?
- What?

1903
01:43:17,108 --> 01:43:20,153
Furthermore, it will be
my professional recommendation

1904
01:43:20,236 --> 01:43:22,363
to the local authorities
that the manner of death

1905
01:43:22,447 --> 01:43:26,576
in the case of Harlan Thrombey
is ruled as suicide!

1906
01:43:26,659 --> 01:43:28,119
- And the case is closed.
- Blanc?

1907
01:43:28,203 --> 01:43:30,997
- What?
- Thank you all for coming. Goodbye.

1908
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:32,499
What's going on? Just tell me--

1909
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:37,212
That's certainly not what I was expecting.

1910
01:43:37,295 --> 01:43:39,547
- No.
- Is anybody else confused?

1911
01:43:39,631 --> 01:43:41,674
Not what I was expecting to hear at all.

1912
01:43:44,344 --> 01:43:46,012
Are you gonna tell me
what the hell is going on?

1913
01:43:46,095 --> 01:43:48,932
- Yes. Yes.
- I just wanna come clean, okay?

1914
01:43:49,015 --> 01:43:50,308
- It's over.
- Almost.

1915
01:43:50,391 --> 01:43:51,684
Blanc, what are we doing?

1916
01:43:51,768 --> 01:43:54,145
- What's going on?
- I'm sorry. Officer Wagner.

1917
01:43:54,229 --> 01:43:57,315
Keep the family out of this room,
and get 'em out of the house if you can.

1918
01:43:57,398 --> 01:43:59,484
But stand by with your additional officer.

1919
01:43:59,567 --> 01:44:00,610
Get the family out?

1920
01:44:00,693 --> 01:44:02,403
Yes, but not all of them. Would you...

1921
01:44:02,487 --> 01:44:03,446
Thank you.

1922
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:04,739
- Blanc.
- Yes, sir.

1923
01:44:04,822 --> 01:44:06,282
Come on, what's all this drama?

1924
01:44:06,366 --> 01:44:08,034
- Indulge me.
- Blanc,

1925
01:44:08,117 --> 01:44:11,621
I told Ransom, Ransom told you,
and I'm telling you now,

1926
01:44:11,704 --> 01:44:14,541
it is an immovable fact
that I killed Harlan.

1927
01:44:14,624 --> 01:44:17,168
Yes, you did. Yes, he did. Yes, you are.

1928
01:44:17,252 --> 01:44:20,421
But-- But, I spoke in the car
about the hole

1929
01:44:20,505 --> 01:44:22,090
at the center of this doughnut.

1930
01:44:22,674 --> 01:44:25,260
And what you and Harlan did
that fateful night

1931
01:44:25,343 --> 01:44:28,513
seems at first glance
to fill that hole perfectly.

1932
01:44:28,596 --> 01:44:31,349
A doughnut hole in a doughnut's hole.

1933
01:44:31,849 --> 01:44:34,185
But we must look a little closer.

1934
01:44:34,602 --> 01:44:37,188
And when we do, we see the doughnut hole

1935
01:44:37,647 --> 01:44:39,440
has a hole in its center.

1936
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:42,026
It is not a doughnut hole,

1937
01:44:42,110 --> 01:44:44,988
but a smaller doughnut with its own hole

1938
01:44:45,071 --> 01:44:47,865
and our doughnut is not whole at all!

1939
01:44:47,949 --> 01:44:50,076
Blanc, look, I understand
that this is amusing for you--

1940
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:52,412
Why was I hired?

1941
01:44:53,246 --> 01:44:54,831
Why would someone hire me?

1942
01:44:54,914 --> 01:44:57,667
Someone fishing for a crime
to reverse the will. Come on.

1943
01:44:57,750 --> 01:45:00,086
But I was hired
before the sealed will was read.

1944
01:45:00,169 --> 01:45:04,507
So, yes, the person must have known
the contents of the will.

1945
01:45:04,591 --> 01:45:06,009
But one step further.

1946
01:45:06,092 --> 01:45:09,012
That same person must have known
a crime was committed,

1947
01:45:09,095 --> 01:45:10,555
and further...

1948
01:45:11,014 --> 01:45:15,268
If the intent was to reverse
Marta's inheritance,

1949
01:45:16,019 --> 01:45:18,771
they must have known
that Marta was responsible.

1950
01:45:19,147 --> 01:45:21,524
An intriguing combination of factors.

1951
01:45:21,608 --> 01:45:24,861
Someone who knew what Marta did
wanted to expose it

1952
01:45:24,944 --> 01:45:26,904
but could not reveal how they knew.

1953
01:45:26,988 --> 01:45:28,281
Fran!

1954
01:45:28,364 --> 01:45:31,117
She was blackmailing me.
She knew what I did.

1955
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:34,871
Yeah, but Fran wanted money,
ergo she did not want the crime exposed.

1956
01:45:34,996 --> 01:45:37,832
What if someone in the family had observed
Marta doing something suspicious?

1957
01:45:37,915 --> 01:45:41,002
But they would have had
no reason not to speak up.

1958
01:45:42,754 --> 01:45:46,341
The answer is not so simple.

1959
01:45:46,924 --> 01:45:51,220
Now with the entire solution
in my field of view,

1960
01:45:51,304 --> 01:45:54,307
the arc of this case
is a tragedy of errors.

1961
01:45:56,684 --> 01:45:59,020
Marta, it will not be easy
for you to hear.

1962
01:45:59,771 --> 01:46:02,190
But there is at least

1963
01:46:02,690 --> 01:46:05,234
one truly guilty party behind it all,

1964
01:46:05,318 --> 01:46:08,446
guilty in the true sense
of acting with malice

1965
01:46:09,155 --> 01:46:12,116
and committing a heinous crime
with selfish intent.

1966
01:46:14,869 --> 01:46:16,120
Trooper Wagner.

1967
01:46:16,204 --> 01:46:17,705
Trooper Wagner?

1968
01:46:18,873 --> 01:46:19,874
No.

1969
01:46:22,251 --> 01:46:24,379
Marta, I'm so sorry.
I told them everything.

1970
01:46:24,462 --> 01:46:25,922
I figured it was up. I'm sorry.

1971
01:46:26,005 --> 01:46:28,383
Hey. It's all right, Ransom,
I'm glad you did.

1972
01:46:28,466 --> 01:46:30,551
Not exactly everything though.

1973
01:46:30,968 --> 01:46:32,929
Is this about what Greatnana told you?

1974
01:46:33,346 --> 01:46:36,140
She saw me that night.
She mistook me for Ransom.

1975
01:46:36,224 --> 01:46:37,225
We'll get to that.

1976
01:46:37,308 --> 01:46:38,726
In the meanwhile,

1977
01:46:39,435 --> 01:46:41,604
Mr. Hugh Ransom Drysdale,

1978
01:46:42,188 --> 01:46:45,900
you might tell us all why you hired me.

1979
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:50,613
Why I hired you?

1980
01:46:51,406 --> 01:46:54,826
You're right. Let's back it up
to the night of the party.

1981
01:46:55,201 --> 01:46:57,161
<i>Your argument with Harlan.</i>

1982
01:46:57,787 --> 01:46:59,205
What were the overheard words

1983
01:46:59,288 --> 01:47:01,791
by the Nazi child
masturbating in the bathroom?

1984
01:47:02,417 --> 01:47:05,878
<i>"My will, " and "I'm warning you."</i>

1985
01:47:05,962 --> 01:47:08,464
You and Harlan were drama mamas.

1986
01:47:08,548 --> 01:47:11,426
You shared a love of twisting the knife
into one another.

1987
01:47:11,509 --> 01:47:14,554
You see, I don't believe
he would have slipped it in halfway.

1988
01:47:14,637 --> 01:47:15,638
No, no, no.

1989
01:47:16,514 --> 01:47:17,598
I submit

1990
01:47:18,266 --> 01:47:20,768
Harlan told you everything.

1991
01:47:20,852 --> 01:47:22,103
You can't be serious!

1992
01:47:22,186 --> 01:47:28,109
Not a red dime or word of my work
to a single one of them, you included.

1993
01:47:28,568 --> 01:47:29,610
Marta,

1994
01:47:29,986 --> 01:47:33,531
remind me what Ransom said
his conversation with Harlan ended with?

1995
01:47:34,657 --> 01:47:36,993
Harlan told him that
I could beat him at Go.

1996
01:47:37,076 --> 01:47:40,163
And I asked myself, "Marta?

1997
01:47:40,246 --> 01:47:44,750
Why would the topic of the will
have steered around to Marta?"

1998
01:47:46,127 --> 01:47:49,130
There is one obvious explanation.

1999
01:47:49,213 --> 01:47:52,091
You can't be that crazy. You're not
just gonna throw away your fortune.

2000
01:47:52,175 --> 01:47:54,135
No. I'm giving it to Marta.

2001
01:47:54,218 --> 01:47:55,595
All of it.

2002
01:47:56,804 --> 01:47:57,930
Your Brazilian nurse?

2003
01:47:58,014 --> 01:47:59,432
Are you goddamn insane?

2004
01:47:59,515 --> 01:48:02,518
I'm sane for the first time in my life,
and I've done it.

2005
01:48:02,602 --> 01:48:04,228
If you think I'm gonna let this happen,

2006
01:48:04,312 --> 01:48:06,564
- if you think I'll stand here--
- I've made the change to my will.

2007
01:48:06,647 --> 01:48:08,649
- It's done.
- I'm warning you!

2008
01:48:09,984 --> 01:48:11,694
That's some heavy-duty conjecture.

2009
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:13,446
Granted.

2010
01:48:13,863 --> 01:48:16,782
But it is the only way
what comes next makes sense.

2011
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:20,495
So you storm out,
you drive off into the night.

2012
01:48:21,954 --> 01:48:23,080
<i>You tell Marta later--</i>

2013
01:48:23,581 --> 01:48:26,083
What was it?
Feeling an overwhelming sense of...

2014
01:48:26,626 --> 01:48:27,752
Clarity.

2015
01:48:28,294 --> 01:48:31,422
That he had to make do for himself
from here on out.

2016
01:48:31,506 --> 01:48:32,507
Exactly.

2017
01:48:35,801 --> 01:48:38,429
<i>Marta. The will. Harlan.</i>

2018
01:48:38,513 --> 01:48:40,056
<i>"Do for yourself."</i>

2019
01:48:40,139 --> 01:48:42,016
<i>"You won't get away with this."</i>

2020
01:48:42,725 --> 01:48:44,685
<i>And a plan forms.</i>

2021
01:48:53,319 --> 01:48:54,445
<i>You return,</i>

2022
01:48:54,529 --> 01:48:57,323
<i>careful to avoid the gate's
security camera range.</i>

2023
01:48:57,782 --> 01:49:00,159
<i>Then on foot up towards the house,</i>

2024
01:49:00,243 --> 01:49:02,078
<i>you sneak in up the trellis,</i>

2025
01:49:02,161 --> 01:49:04,580
<i>so as not to be seen
by the rest of the family</i>

2026
01:49:04,664 --> 01:49:07,416
<i>who are still having
their party downstairs.</i>

2027
01:49:09,001 --> 01:49:12,964
<i>What you need to do will take moments.</i>

2028
01:49:13,047 --> 01:49:16,968
<i>But it is essential
that you are alone and undetected.</i>

2029
01:49:17,552 --> 01:49:20,012
<i>You knew what medications Harlan took.</i>

2030
01:49:20,096 --> 01:49:22,932
<i>You knew what Marta would be
injecting him with that night.</i>

2031
01:49:23,849 --> 01:49:24,850
<i>And you knew</i>

2032
01:49:25,977 --> 01:49:29,564
if Marta was responsible for his death,

2033
01:49:29,647 --> 01:49:31,274
<i>even unintentionally,</i>

2034
01:49:32,483 --> 01:49:35,486
the slayer rule would nullify
the changed will

2035
01:49:35,570 --> 01:49:37,697
and you would get your share back.

2036
01:49:38,739 --> 01:49:40,366
<i>You used the syringes in the kit</i>

2037
01:49:40,449 --> 01:49:43,077
<i>to switch the liquids
in the two medication vials.</i>

2038
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:45,788
And as a final precaution...

2039
01:49:47,873 --> 01:49:50,042
<i>you took the Naloxone,</i>

2040
01:49:50,543 --> 01:49:52,837
the lifesaving antidote.

2041
01:49:53,671 --> 01:49:55,673
<i>No. No, no, no, that's impossible.</i>

2042
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:57,717
That is the truth.

2043
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:00,261
Hand me that vial of morphine.
I'll show you.

2044
01:50:00,344 --> 01:50:02,763
If he did that, if the meds were switched,

2045
01:50:03,347 --> 01:50:05,975
then when I got them mixed up, I...

2046
01:50:07,310 --> 01:50:09,562
I accidentally switched them back, so...

2047
01:50:10,855 --> 01:50:12,023
I gave Harlan...

2048
01:50:12,106 --> 01:50:13,274
The correct doses.

2049
01:50:14,066 --> 01:50:15,234
Yes.

2050
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:19,155
But not accidentally.

2051
01:50:20,865 --> 01:50:23,951
I taped over the label of these two vials.

2052
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:27,913
The vials themselves are identical.

2053
01:50:30,625 --> 01:50:32,418
How'd you know this was the morphine?

2054
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:34,629
I just knew.

2055
01:50:34,712 --> 01:50:37,882
You knew because there is the slightest,
almost imperceptible differences

2056
01:50:37,965 --> 01:50:40,259
of tincture and viscosity
between the two liquids.

2057
01:50:42,386 --> 01:50:46,057
You knew because
you've done it a hundred times.

2058
01:50:47,224 --> 01:50:49,477
You gave him the correct medication

2059
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:52,021
because you are a good nurse.

2060
01:50:53,439 --> 01:50:54,565
Then Harlan was--

2061
01:50:54,649 --> 01:50:56,567
I'm sorry, Marta. But yes.

2062
01:50:58,110 --> 01:51:00,071
- Harlan was perfectly fine.
- Oh, my God.

2063
01:51:01,238 --> 01:51:02,531
His blood was normal.

2064
01:51:03,574 --> 01:51:07,161
The cause of death was truly,
solely suicide,

2065
01:51:07,662 --> 01:51:10,915
and you are guilty of nothing
but some damage to the trellis

2066
01:51:10,998 --> 01:51:12,541
and a few amateur theatrics.

2067
01:51:13,417 --> 01:51:17,546
In fact, if Harlan had listened to you
and called the ambulance...

2068
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:20,800
he would be alive today.

2069
01:51:24,929 --> 01:51:25,930
Damn!

2070
01:51:26,013 --> 01:51:27,431
A twisted web.

2071
01:51:28,891 --> 01:51:30,935
And we are not finished untangling it.

2072
01:51:31,018 --> 01:51:32,061
Not yet.

2073
01:51:32,853 --> 01:51:36,857
Marta, when Greatnana spotted you
climbing down the trellis, she said...

2074
01:51:38,359 --> 01:51:42,113
Ransom? Are you back again already?

2075
01:51:42,196 --> 01:51:44,990
<i>"Are you back again already?"</i>

2076
01:51:45,074 --> 01:51:46,367
'Cause earlier that night...

2077
01:51:49,578 --> 01:51:51,914
Ransom, you're back?

2078
01:51:54,375 --> 01:51:55,584
Come on, Marta.

2079
01:51:55,668 --> 01:51:57,920
This is "stoopid" with two O's.

2080
01:51:58,003 --> 01:52:00,631
You don't have a shred of evidence.
You're just spinning a fairy tale.

2081
01:52:00,715 --> 01:52:02,258
Not a shred, no.

2082
01:52:02,758 --> 01:52:05,803
Just as we have no real proof
of Marta mixing up the vials,

2083
01:52:05,886 --> 01:52:06,971
so it's your word--

2084
01:52:07,054 --> 01:52:08,264
You have her confession!

2085
01:52:11,058 --> 01:52:12,268
All right, yeah.

2086
01:52:13,310 --> 01:52:14,687
Yeah, we do have that.

2087
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:16,981
With your permission,
I'd like to spin a little further.

2088
01:52:18,023 --> 01:52:20,568
<i>Much later that night,
you yd have to come back to the house</i>

2089
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:23,279
<i>to retrieve the incriminating
tampered vials.</i>

2090
01:52:23,362 --> 01:52:26,407
<i>However, this time the dogs were outside.</i>

2091
01:52:29,118 --> 01:52:31,203
<i>They barked, waking Meg.</i>

2092
01:52:31,287 --> 01:52:32,413
<i>No matter.</i>

2093
01:52:32,496 --> 01:52:34,331
<i>You'll get the vials tomorrow.</i>

2094
01:52:34,415 --> 01:52:36,167
But tomorrow brings news.

2095
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:38,961
Not of a medical error and a guilty nurse,

2096
01:52:39,044 --> 01:52:41,213
but of a slit throat and a suicide.

2097
01:52:46,177 --> 01:52:48,679
<i>Now the circumstances are perfect</i>

2098
01:52:48,763 --> 01:52:50,431
<i>for the anonymous hirin' of me.</i>

2099
01:52:51,432 --> 01:52:53,642
<i>You know a crime has been committed
by Miss Cabrera.</i>

2100
01:52:53,726 --> 01:52:55,186
<i>You need her to be caught for it.</i>

2101
01:52:55,269 --> 01:52:58,147
You cannot reveal how you know.

2102
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:01,150
Enter...

2103
01:53:01,233 --> 01:53:02,318
Benoit Blanc.

2104
01:53:02,943 --> 01:53:04,904
Benny, look, I hear what you're saying,

2105
01:53:04,987 --> 01:53:06,030
but this--

2106
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:08,449
The body is discovered early
the next morning.

2107
01:53:08,532 --> 01:53:10,910
<i>The police,
the medical examiner, the family,</i>

2108
01:53:11,327 --> 01:53:13,454
everyone swarms in

2109
01:53:13,537 --> 01:53:15,289
and there is no possible way

2110
01:53:15,372 --> 01:53:18,375
you can get to Marta's medical bag
to retrieve the vials.

2111
01:53:18,459 --> 01:53:19,960
You must wait for your moment,

2112
01:53:20,044 --> 01:53:21,670
when the investigation is over

2113
01:53:21,754 --> 01:53:25,132
and you know the house will be empty.

2114
01:53:25,216 --> 01:53:26,801
And that is why

2115
01:53:27,384 --> 01:53:28,803
you missed the funeral.

2116
01:53:30,179 --> 01:53:33,933
<i>There is no one home to wonder
why you're going into Harlan's study.</i>

2117
01:53:35,142 --> 01:53:36,894
<i>Or so you think.</i>

2118
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:41,315
<i>Poor Fran.</i>

2119
01:53:41,398 --> 01:53:42,775
<i>She witnessed you tampering</i>

2120
01:53:42,858 --> 01:53:45,110
<i>with Harlan's medication
in the medical bag.</i>

2121
01:53:45,194 --> 01:53:48,489
<i>She did not know what you were doing.</i>

2122
01:53:49,198 --> 01:53:51,700
<i>But she knew you were up to no good.</i>

2123
01:53:51,784 --> 01:53:53,619
<i>So her mind begins to turn.</i>

2124
01:53:53,702 --> 01:53:54,703
<i>Oh, God.</i>

2125
01:53:55,538 --> 01:53:58,415
That Hallmark movie she told me about
with Danica McKellar...

2126
01:53:58,874 --> 01:54:00,000
<i>Deadly by Surprise.</i>

2127
01:54:00,084 --> 01:54:01,627
That's what she was talking about.

2128
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:03,087
She loved Harlan.

2129
01:54:03,504 --> 01:54:04,880
She hates Ransom.

2130
01:54:05,339 --> 01:54:07,591
So the poor girl decides
to test her theory,

2131
01:54:07,675 --> 01:54:09,385
and make this asshole pay.

2132
01:54:09,468 --> 01:54:12,429
She gets a copy of the toxicology report.

2133
01:54:12,513 --> 01:54:15,933
Now, I will be honest, I have no idea how.

2134
01:54:16,016 --> 01:54:17,309
'Cause she has a cousin.

2135
01:54:18,227 --> 01:54:21,564
She told me, she has a cousin who works as
a receptionist at the examiner's office.

2136
01:54:21,647 --> 01:54:22,898
Well, <i>voilá!</i>

2137
01:54:22,982 --> 01:54:25,901
The numbers, they mean nothing to her,

2138
01:54:25,985 --> 01:54:29,697
but if Ransom is guilty,
its existence is a threat,

2139
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:32,700
so she photocopies the header
and makes her blackmail note.

2140
01:54:33,784 --> 01:54:35,160
So why did she send it to me?

2141
01:54:35,244 --> 01:54:36,328
She didn't.

2142
01:54:37,079 --> 01:54:38,706
She sent it to Ransom.

2143
01:54:43,961 --> 01:54:46,171
<i>And when Mr. Drysdale gets it,</i>

2144
01:54:46,255 --> 01:54:47,631
<i>what is his reaction?</i>

2145
01:54:48,340 --> 01:54:49,341
Elation.

2146
01:54:49,425 --> 01:54:53,387
<i>He still thinks Marta has given Harlan
the tampered drugs.</i>

2147
01:54:53,470 --> 01:54:56,140
<i>A blood tox report will prove her guilt.</i>

2148
01:54:56,223 --> 01:54:58,475
<i>He goes to the will reading
in high spirits,</i>

2149
01:54:58,559 --> 01:55:01,353
ready to see the family tear itself apart,

2150
01:55:01,437 --> 01:55:04,023
secure in the knowledge
it will be all undone

2151
01:55:04,106 --> 01:55:06,442
when the tox report comes to light.

2152
01:55:07,651 --> 01:55:09,028
And then...

2153
01:55:10,195 --> 01:55:11,739
<i>Marta's confession.</i>

2154
01:55:12,573 --> 01:55:15,200
<i>And everything turns on its head.</i>

2155
01:55:15,284 --> 01:55:19,413
<i>He now realizes that Marta
has committed no crime</i>

2156
01:55:19,496 --> 01:55:22,958
<i>and the tox report
will prove her innocence.</i>

2157
01:55:23,584 --> 01:55:25,461
<i>The changed will is gonna stand.</i>

2158
01:55:26,003 --> 01:55:27,713
<i>He has lost.</i>

2159
01:55:29,548 --> 01:55:31,008
<i>Unless...</i>

2160
01:55:31,675 --> 01:55:33,344
Unless you decide...

2161
01:55:33,427 --> 01:55:36,680
- You're not gonna give up the money.
- You're not gonna give up the money.

2162
01:55:36,764 --> 01:55:39,391
- You've come this far.
- You've come this far.

2163
01:55:40,309 --> 01:55:42,227
Just one step further,

2164
01:55:42,895 --> 01:55:45,606
just one last act.

2165
01:55:45,689 --> 01:55:47,858
In for a penny, in for a pound.

2166
01:55:50,527 --> 01:55:52,363
You decide you are in.

2167
01:55:57,368 --> 01:55:58,619
<i>Step one...</i>

2168
01:55:59,912 --> 01:56:02,790
<i>Destroy all evidence of Marta's innocence.</i>

2169
01:56:09,296 --> 01:56:10,547
<i>Step two,</i>

2170
01:56:10,631 --> 01:56:12,925
<i>send her the anonymous e-mail</i>

2171
01:56:13,008 --> 01:56:15,469
<i>with a late morning rendezvous time...</i>

2172
01:56:18,973 --> 01:56:22,017
<i>And deliver her the blackmail note.</i>

2173
01:56:24,561 --> 01:56:25,938
<i>Step three,</i>

2174
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:28,899
<i>keep your appointment with Fran.</i>

2175
01:56:30,567 --> 01:56:32,152
Oh, I knew it.

2176
01:56:32,611 --> 01:56:34,863
I knew you were a no-good son of a bitch.

2177
01:56:35,447 --> 01:56:37,574
I knew Harlan wouldn't just kill himself.

2178
01:56:37,658 --> 01:56:39,201
Yes, Fran, you were right.

2179
01:56:39,576 --> 01:56:41,870
I knew you were guilty as shit.

2180
01:56:41,954 --> 01:56:43,914
And now you're gonna pay for it!

2181
01:56:44,331 --> 01:56:45,833
Don't you come near me.

2182
01:56:45,916 --> 01:56:48,460
Don't come near me! I'm warning you!

2183
01:56:57,928 --> 01:57:00,097
<i>See, now, now the board is set.</i>

2184
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:02,182
<i>Marta will get the blackmail note.</i>

2185
01:57:02,266 --> 01:57:04,226
<i>You'll put the pieces together for her.</i>

2186
01:57:04,309 --> 01:57:06,061
<i>You'll guide her to the rendezvous.</i>

2187
01:57:06,145 --> 01:57:08,355
<i>You'll make the anonymous call
to the police,</i>

2188
01:57:08,439 --> 01:57:11,400
<i>they will catch her there
with the body and the burned evidence.</i>

2189
01:57:11,483 --> 01:57:14,194
Marta will get arrested for killing Fran

2190
01:57:14,278 --> 01:57:15,738
and Harlan.

2191
01:57:17,031 --> 01:57:19,158
- She said...
- You did this.

2192
01:57:20,617 --> 01:57:23,162
She didn't say, "You did this."

2193
01:57:24,580 --> 01:57:26,415
She wasn't talking about me. She said...

2194
01:57:26,498 --> 01:57:28,625
Hugh did this.

2195
01:57:28,709 --> 01:57:30,044
"Hugh did this."

2196
01:57:30,919 --> 01:57:33,005
'Cause you made the help call you "Hugh."

2197
01:57:34,423 --> 01:57:35,632
'Cause you're an asshole.

2198
01:57:37,134 --> 01:57:38,761
And it would have worked

2199
01:57:39,303 --> 01:57:41,555
if we hadn't have brought you in
for questioning

2200
01:57:41,638 --> 01:57:44,433
<i>so you could not make your anonymous call.</i>

2201
01:57:44,516 --> 01:57:45,851
<i>And if Fran had not stashed</i>

2202
01:57:45,934 --> 01:57:48,437
a safety copy of the tox report.

2203
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:52,566
And if Marta had not
outplayed you once again.

2204
01:57:53,609 --> 01:57:55,277
<i>By having a kind heart.</i>

2205
01:57:57,654 --> 01:57:59,782
<i>By saving Fran's life,</i>

2206
01:58:00,282 --> 01:58:03,452
<i>though it meant her losing the inheritance
and going to jail.</i>

2207
01:58:03,535 --> 01:58:05,913
She didn't play your game.

2208
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:08,248
She saved Fran's life.

2209
01:58:11,543 --> 01:58:12,544
Fran's alive?

2210
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:14,421
Oh, yes.

2211
01:58:15,005 --> 01:58:16,048
Fran...

2212
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:19,551
...who will confirm this very story

2213
01:58:20,344 --> 01:58:21,512
or something close to it.

2214
01:58:22,846 --> 01:58:25,974
And send you, Hugh,

2215
01:58:26,558 --> 01:58:27,559
to jail.

2216
01:58:32,564 --> 01:58:33,565
Yes?

2217
01:58:37,111 --> 01:58:38,612
Doctor, that's great news.

2218
01:58:39,696 --> 01:58:41,615
We'll be there soon. Thank you.

2219
01:58:46,036 --> 01:58:47,037
She's okay.

2220
01:58:47,955 --> 01:58:49,123
She's ready to talk.

2221
01:58:49,957 --> 01:58:53,001
Trooper Wagner, if you could
keep Mr. Drysdale in custody

2222
01:58:53,085 --> 01:58:55,212
while Lieutenant Elliott,
Miss Cabrera, and myself,

2223
01:58:55,295 --> 01:58:57,881
we go to the hospital
and take Fran's statement.

2224
01:58:57,965 --> 01:58:59,383
All right. Up, come on.

2225
01:59:05,722 --> 01:59:07,182
I'm gonna say this just to you.

2226
01:59:07,724 --> 01:59:10,769
No cameras, no courtroom,
just you, 'cause you know it's true.

2227
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:13,397
We allowed you into our home.

2228
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:16,692
We let you watch our granddad.
We welcomed you into our family.

2229
01:59:16,775 --> 01:59:19,111
And now you think
you can steal it from us?

2230
01:59:19,194 --> 01:59:22,406
You think I'm not gonna fight
to protect my home,

2231
01:59:22,489 --> 01:59:24,158
our birthright,

2232
01:59:24,241 --> 01:59:26,743
our ancestral family home?

2233
01:59:29,121 --> 01:59:30,581
That is hooey.

2234
01:59:30,664 --> 01:59:33,000
Harlan, he bought this place in the '80s

2235
01:59:33,083 --> 01:59:35,544
- from a Pakistani real estate billionaire.
- Oh, shut up, Blanc!

2236
01:59:35,627 --> 01:59:41,550
Shut up! Shut up with that
Kentucky Fried Foghorn Leghorn drawl!

2237
01:59:41,633 --> 01:59:43,510
Yeah, I killed Fran. But I guess I didn't.

2238
01:59:43,594 --> 01:59:45,387
So what do you have on me?

2239
01:59:45,470 --> 01:59:47,139
Nothing. What, attempted murder?

2240
01:59:47,222 --> 01:59:49,683
I get arson for the building
and a few other charges.

2241
01:59:49,766 --> 01:59:53,228
With a good lawyer, which I have,
I'll be out in no time.

2242
01:59:53,312 --> 01:59:56,815
And then you'll see just how much hell
I can wreak on your life,

2243
01:59:56,899 --> 01:59:59,610
you vicious little bitch.

2244
02:00:06,992 --> 02:00:08,452
What the shit!

2245
02:00:09,703 --> 02:00:11,288
That means she's lying!

2246
02:00:11,371 --> 02:00:12,706
Yeah, man, we know.

2247
02:00:12,789 --> 02:00:14,041
That's right.

2248
02:00:14,666 --> 02:00:15,667
Fran's dead.

2249
02:00:20,130 --> 02:00:22,299
And you just confessed to her murder.

2250
02:00:34,978 --> 02:00:36,146
Well...

2251
02:00:37,314 --> 02:00:38,690
In for a penny...

2252
02:01:23,068 --> 02:01:24,194
Shit.

2253
02:02:57,412 --> 02:02:58,705
Linda!

2254
02:02:58,789 --> 02:02:59,790
Linda!

2255
02:02:59,873 --> 02:03:02,417
We've gotta get the attorneys
on the phone right now!

2256
02:03:03,126 --> 02:03:04,127
We--

2257
02:03:10,342 --> 02:03:11,510
<i>Can I ask,</i>

2258
02:03:11,593 --> 02:03:14,763
<i>when did you know I had something to do
with Harlan's death?</i>

2259
02:03:15,889 --> 02:03:18,683
From the first moment
you set foot in front of me.

2260
02:03:23,939 --> 02:03:25,023
Oh, shit.

2261
02:03:25,107 --> 02:03:28,110
I want you to remember something
that's very important.

2262
02:03:29,486 --> 02:03:30,654
You won,

2263
02:03:30,737 --> 02:03:33,490
not by playing the game Harlan's way...

2264
02:03:34,324 --> 02:03:35,450
but yours.

2265
02:03:37,828 --> 02:03:39,037
You're a good person.

2266
02:03:41,289 --> 02:03:42,707
This family...

2267
02:03:49,089 --> 02:03:51,216
I should help them. Right?

2268
02:03:52,134 --> 02:03:54,553
Well, I have my opinion,

2269
02:03:56,138 --> 02:03:58,432
but I have a feeling
you'll follow your heart.
