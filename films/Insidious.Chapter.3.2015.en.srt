1
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,607
Who is it?

2
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,610
Um... Hi.

3
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,126
My name is Quinn. I was looking for Elise.

4
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,764
It's okay, Warren. Go upstairs.

5
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,606
I'm Elise.

6
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,489
Hi. Gosh,
I'm sorry to bother you like this.

7
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,206
Um... I got your name
from Claire Ortisky's mom.

8
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,647
Mrs. Ortisky. Emily.
Sorry, Emily Ortisky.

9
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,883
Um... Yeah, she told me
you worked as a psychic

10
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,361
and that you were
really amazing when she saw you.

11
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,488
I remember Emily.

12
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,040
Yeah. She's awesome.
She's like, she's really nice.

13
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,448
And she told me how great you were.

14
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,487
She gave me a phone number for you,
but it wasn't working.

15
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,291
So, you know, I...

16
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,443
I'm really sorry
to have just shown up like this.

17
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,291
It's okay.

18
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,042
But if you're looking for a reading,

19
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,043
unfortunately, I don't do those anymore.

20
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,610
I have money. I brought like $50.

21
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,648
No, no, no, no. It's not that, honey.

22
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,205
I just can't, and I'm pretty busy, so...

23
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,446
Okay.

24
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,131
Where did you come from?

25
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,561
Uh, Whealan Park.

26
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,681
That's a long way.

27
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,841
Yeah, it's no big deal though.

28
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,480
I mean, I'm the one who just showed up.

29
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,688
I'm really sorry that
I've wasted your time.

30
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,368
Why don't you come in for a minute?

31
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,729
Um... A good chat
is never time wasted, right?

32
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,327
I love the style
of your house. It's so cool.

33
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,204
Thank you. Have a seat.

34
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,361
Thanks.

35
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,004
You're a very smart girl, Quinn.

36
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,920
Um, depends who you ask.

37
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,246
No, you are. You read a lot.

38
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,527
You have a lot of books
in that bag of yours.

39
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,204
Yeah. Yeah. I love reading.

40
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,887
What made you come
all the way here today?

41
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,485
Um...

42
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,970
I... I wanna talk
to someone who's not around anymore.

43
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,561
Who?

44
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,207
My mom.

45
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,243
She died a year and a half ago.

46
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,727
She had cancer.

47
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,688
I mean, well,
first she had breast cancer

48
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,966
and then she had a mastectomy,

49
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,171
but it decided to
hang around and travel to her lungs.

50
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,449
So, I guess you could say
it wanted to be with her

51
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,124
just as much as
everyone else did.

52
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,721
Well, tell me about her.

53
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,561
I mean, she was great.

54
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,449
Like, I mean, she could always hang
out with all of my friends.

55
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,001
God, she loved old music,

56
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,208
like vinyl records and stuff,

57
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,809
and, um, she always
wanted to talk to me.

58
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,721
Like, um...

59
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,921
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,448
No, no. That's okay.

61
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,726
It's like, um...

62
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,171
It's like sometimes I can
feel her around me.

63
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,525
Like at night I'll be in my room,

64
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,604
or, uh, I'll be sleeping
and something will wake me up.

65
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,170
Or, you know, I'll find
things in weird places.

66
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,447
Like I'll find my diary
somewhere strange.

67
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,881
I don't know.

68
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,047
I mean, I guess it's kind of crazy.

69
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,281
Not to me, it isn't.

70
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,241
You've tried to contact your mother
on your own, haven't you?

71
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,403
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I've...

72
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,765
I mean, I've asked her to talk to me

73
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,490
but, you know, she never does.

74
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,726
That's why I came here.

75
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,250
You know?
I really need to ask her some questions.

76
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,125
I know what that's like.

77
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,728
All right.
You have to give me a moment,

78
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,450
and I can't promise anything.

79
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,765
Um... Here, please take
a little bit of money.

80
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,968
No. I got out of this business.

81
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,769
If I accept that from you,
I'm back in it.

82
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,688
Normally,
we do this downstairs in my reading room.

83
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,527
What's your mom's name?

84
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,043
Lily. Lily Brenner.

85
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,806
Lily Brenner.

86
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,683
I'm calling out and trying to
make contact with Lily Brenner.

87
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,090
Lily, if you can hear me,
please talk to me.

88
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,566
Lily.

89
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,126
Are you out there?

90
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,648
- I can hear someone.
- Is it my mom?

91
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,204
No, it isn't your mother.

92
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,123
Go away.

93
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,402
Go away. Go away.

94
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,001
I'm sorry.

95
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,327
I'm sorry.
There's a reason I had to stop doing this.

96
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,881
There's other people that do this.

97
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,803
You have to find one of them.

98
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,724
You're gonna be okay, Quinn.

99
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,000
But take my advice

100
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,211
and do not try to
contact your mother on your own anymore.

101
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,171
You have to be very careful.

102
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,326
If you call out to one of the dead,

103
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,323
all of them can hear you.

104
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,091
Are... Are you there?

105
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,521
Mom?

106
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,080
Are you there?

107
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,924
Today? No. Today?
No, I don't think so. No.

108
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,047
Hey, you know what?

109
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,647
What I mean is that
I can't be in two places at the same time.

110
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,568
Yeah, the whole building
needs to be rewired.

111
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,563
The original guys really screwed it.

112
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,205
You know,
that's an entire extra day of work for me.

113
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,645
You got that, right?

114
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,047
Hang on, Bill.

115
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,009
There's no food.
Didn't you go to the grocery?

116
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,923
- Yeah, I did.
- Well, what did you get?

117
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,764
I mean, what's this, "quinoa"?

118
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,524
Quinoa.

119
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,727
Uh-huh? Bill?
Yeah, of course, I'm gonna call the guy.

120
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,240
I gotta get the part. Hang on, Bill.

121
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,043
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a photo.

122
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,929
- Why?
- Dad, it's for my blog.

123
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,960
None of what you
just said to me makes any sense.

124
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,126
It's not supposed to.

125
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,282
Okay. Well,
how about don't blog it?

126
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,566
Just eat it.

127
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,481
That's a great t-shirt.

128
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,561
You're weird. You're such a weird person.

129
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,881
You know, nobody cares what
you're having for breakfast.

130
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,531
Will you just go
get your brother ready for school, please?

131
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,569
Alex. Alex!

132
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,846
What?

133
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,491
Come on. Get up.
Get ready for school.

134
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,925
I am.

135
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,888
God, it stinks in here.
Come on, get up.

136
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,884
Okay, fine. I'll tell Dad.

137
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,968
Jeez!
Can you hold on a second? I was getting...

138
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,326
Just get out! Get out! Get out!

139
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,561
Don't touch me!

140
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,050
"I'll never forget this.

141
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,245
"You'll go to the end of the world,

142
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,810
"and you'll find me waiting there.

143
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,566
"Your servant.

144
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,280
"You'll always find me waiting there,
your servant."

145
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,129
Okay. "I'll never forget this."

146
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,245
All right, all right.
I am. I'm hurrying. Right. Bye.

147
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,888
Why is it quiet? Quiet's not good.

148
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,520
Alex, you see this face?
This is my "whoop-ass" face.

149
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,449
When you see this face,
it means I'm about to whoop ass.

150
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,648
Get ready. Come on.

151
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,161
"You gave me life when I was dying.

152
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,447
"And when I was leaving this world..."

153
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,204
- Quinn!
- Jesus, you scared me!

154
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,203
I need to rely on you
to get him up and going.

155
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,248
- He's lying around like a corpse.
- No, I did.

156
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,721
No, I need you to
get him ready for school.

157
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,802
Dad, I have to learn my lines!
When am I gonna do that?

158
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,962
I need your help here. I'm drowning.

159
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,121
He's running late.

160
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,851
You could have done this anytime.
You're being selfish.

161
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,446
Yeah, I'm being really selfish
for worrying about my future?

162
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,366
Just help me out.

163
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,281
Come on.

164
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,570
Oh-ho! Good timing, Hector.

165
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,165
Now, you get to see Quinn.

166
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,890
- Were you waiting there?
- Shut up.

167
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,408
Uh... I wasn't, like, waiting.
I just like... I just came out.

168
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,289
I know.

169
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,044
So, uh, what have you got first?

170
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,724
Uh, I'm not
going to school today.

171
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,087
I have an audition
for a theater school in New York.

172
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,201
Are you serious?
That's awesome. Wow.

173
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,884
New York. It's far away.

174
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,248
Quinn. You gotta see these birds.

175
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,926
There's a flock of them at City Hall.

176
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,971
But these ones are nicer,
but you can't eat them.

177
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,565
Sorry, kids. Uh, sometimes she's
not sure about what she's saying.

178
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,642
- I know her.
- Hmm...

179
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,126
I know her.

180
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,128
That's what you
have to look forward to when you get old.

181
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,406
Yes. So do you.

182
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,845
Yeah, but you'll get old first.

183
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,204
Okay, I can't wait for this thing.
We're taking the stairs.

184
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,850
- No!
- See you later, Hector.

185
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,330
See you! Later.

186
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,404
Mom, help me get through this.

187
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,009
Quinn Brenner?

188
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,202
- Hi there, Quinn.
- Yeah. Hi.

189
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,283
Thank you for coming in.

190
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,641
Thank you. Um, I'm so excited.

191
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,404
I'm a huge fan of your school. I've...

192
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,323
You know, it's always been
a dream of mine to go there.

193
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,560
- I've always...
- Great.

194
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,006
Have you prepared something for us?

195
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,286
Yeah, I have.

196
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,161
Whenever you're ready.

197
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,165
"I won't ever forget this.

198
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,924
"You will go to the end of the world

199
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,048
"and you will find me waiting there.

200
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,201
"Your servant."

201
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,167
Um...

202
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,689
It's okay. It's okay.

203
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,000
You can start the scene again.

204
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,609
Yeah, sorry. I'm sorry. I... I know it.

205
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,640
Do you wanna take a break
and come back in a little bit?

206
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,049
I hate him, and I don't mean
I pretend to hate him,

207
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,406
like, "Really, I love you.
I'm just mad at you,"

208
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,369
I actually literally hate him.

209
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,922
Save the word
"literally" for when you're being literal.

210
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,731
Shut up. God, don't ruin this.

211
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,002
Look, we have a few months
of parental guidance left,

212
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,209
and then this reality
we're currently living in is done.

213
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,611
That's what's so great about it.

214
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,284
You pick a college
on the opposite coast.

215
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,885
He becomes a weekly phone call.

216
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,611
That turns into a monthly phone call
when you need money.

217
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,960
It's like he's not your dad anymore.

218
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,769
He's just a bank you visit on Thanksgiving.

219
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,968
Yeah, but I'm not
going anywhere, Maggie!

220
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,280
I botched the audition

221
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,010
to the one school I wanted to go to.

222
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,805
I don't have a backup plan. It's over.

223
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,731
Lord, you are so born
to be an actress, Brenner.

224
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,881
"It's over!"

225
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,961
No, I'm serious.

226
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,723
That school is all that I wanted.

227
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,490
And my dad wants me here
raising my brother.

228
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,771
You're gonna be gone.

229
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,080
You're gonna be okay.

230
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,165
Yeah, everybody always says that.

231
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,051
Hey. Come on.

232
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,241
Ooh... Lesbifriends.

233
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,242
Oh, no, you're right!

234
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,322
Where's the nearest Jesus Camp?

235
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,440
Have fun with your little boys.

236
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,686
Good bye. Good bye.

237
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,091
See you later, ladies.

238
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,761
Let's get out of here.

239
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,726
Come on, lesbo!

240
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,045
Quinn! No! No!

241
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,723
Someone help us, please!

242
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,687
On my count. One, two, three!

243
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,565
Get the crash cart here.

244
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,806
Okay, get a new line in her.

245
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,280
Monitor's showing V-tach.

246
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,169
Okay, we got multiple
compound fractures on the right leg.

247
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,961
BP is 163, dropping. Rate's degrading.

248
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,840
Okay, give me one amp of epi.

249
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,401
Paddles on 360.

250
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,165
- Charge on 360!
- Do it! We got...

251
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,766
Okay, we got her. We got her back.

252
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,842
Let's keep her stable, folks.

253
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,521
Mom?

254
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,681
Hey, it's Dad.

255
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,089
Honey, I'm here.

256
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,484
Do you remember anything?

257
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,209
I was with Maggie.

258
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,441
And there was this man waving at me.

259
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,922
He... He was at the theater, too.

260
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,929
And then everything went dark.

261
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,641
One second, hon.

262
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,284
Mr. Sean. How are you doing?

263
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,725
Hey, Harry.

264
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,170
You know, we're really sorry

265
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,208
to hear about
what happened to your daughter.

266
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,641
Thanks, Harry.
She's here. That's what counts.

267
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,688
The man who can't breathe.

268
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,807
The man who lives in the vents.

269
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,011
I heard him saying
your name last night.

270
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,564
I heard him in your room
while you were gone.

271
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,447
He's up there right now,

272
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,449
standing in your room.

273
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,285
You will see him.

274
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,849
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

275
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,729
Welcome home, bad ass.

276
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,686
- Yay.
- Oh, my gosh, Quinn.

277
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,569
Yeah, I'm all busted.

278
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,602
Wheelchair's just
until the bones in her legs heal.

279
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,808
Yeah. Thank God, huh? Thank God.

280
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,008
Listen, I'm just happy
that you're gonna get better.

281
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,411
Some people are crazy.

282
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,600
The way they drive around
this neighborhood, you know?

283
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,450
I'm so sorry this happened to you.

284
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,170
Yeah, it's, um, it's pretty embarrassing.

285
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,203
- I sent some flowers.
- We got 'em.

286
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,766
Hey, uh... Can I tag this thing or what?
Is that a cliché?

287
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,450
No. Knock yourself out.

288
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,080
Wow, you have
been saving that one.

289
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,168
You just had to wait
for Quinn to get hit by a car.

290
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,730
I think she's done
being shown off now.

291
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,802
Listen, we just wanted
to see you, Quinn. Okay.

292
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,530
Listen, anything you need.

293
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,040
- Thanks, Ernesto.
- Well, I mean it.

294
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,280
See you later.

295
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,206
Home again home.

296
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,801
All right, ready?

297
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,883
One, two, three.

298
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,484
Great neighbors we have, huh?

299
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,770
Crazy cat lady on one side

300
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,161
and a boy who's clearly
in love with you on the other.

301
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,529
- He's not in love with me.
- Mmm-hmm.

302
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,841
You know, everyone that looks at me
isn't in love with me, Dad.

303
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,763
Especially since I'm a cripple now.

304
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,605
Hey. No sarcasm.

305
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,282
Not since I got you
such an awesome gift basket.

306
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,202
Huh? Everything you like. Books.

307
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,922
Uh...

308
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,765
Bell. In case you
want me to wait on you.

309
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,004
- Some French food?
- French onion dip?

310
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,201
<i>Oui?</i>

311
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,405
Uh... Snacks.

312
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,527
What?

313
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,805
I'm vegetarian.

314
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,962
- Really?
- Yeah.

315
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,686
When did that happen?

316
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,886
It doesn't matter.

317
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,402
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

318
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,927
So, uh...

319
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,646
Did any letters come from any schools?

320
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,848
No, I don't want you
to worry about that right now.

321
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,844
The only thing I want you
to think about right now is getting better.

322
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,610
Understand?

323
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,330
Think of it as a gift-wrapped excuse

324
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,323
to do your favorite thing in the world.

325
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,206
Sleep.

326
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,641
Hey.

327
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,324
You need me?
I thought I heard the bell.

328
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,121
No, I'm fine.

329
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,081
Good night, Warren.

330
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,886
Good night, Jack.

331
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,171
What the hell was that?

332
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,330
I'm not making this up, Mel.

333
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,640
It cracked my ceiling.

334
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,171
I'm not saying you are.

335
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,127
I'm just showing you that there's
nobody living above you right now.

336
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,281
See?

337
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,243
Yeah. Well, I heard it.

338
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,770
And it came from that room.

339
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,131
Mel, come look at this.

340
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,006
What do you say now?
No one up here, huh?

341
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,650
I don't know what to tell you.

342
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,610
Tell me who's gonna
pay for the crack in my ceiling.

343
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,205
Why can't I ever...

344
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,362
Quinn, where's the frying pan, please?

345
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,329
Third drawer in the far left.

346
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,243
Yeah. I looked there already.

347
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,041
You know what?
I can't take this right now.

348
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,246
I'm too busy.

349
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,049
Alex! No eggs this morning.

350
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,561
Just find what you can in the fridge
for breakfast, okay?

351
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,960
Whatever!

352
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,929
Come on, Quinn. Eat your breakfast.

353
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,121
I don't want to.

354
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,645
You have to.

355
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,131
I can't taste it.

356
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,843
I can't taste anything anymore.

357
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,326
Alex, are you dressed?

358
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,641
Yes!

359
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,171
I went to see a psychic.

360
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,849
I wanted to talk to Mom.

361
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,846
You what?

362
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,605
I went and saw
a psychic woman named Elise.

363
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,284
Claire's mom gave me her address.

364
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,531
When was that?

365
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,489
Like a month or so back.

366
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,210
Strange things
have been happening.

367
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,367
Like that knocking I heard last night,

368
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,647
I think that was Mom
trying to reach me.

369
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,846
Quinn.

370
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,243
I don't want you to
get any funny ideas.

371
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,890
You know, these nutcases are...

372
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,166
They're paid to give you hope.

373
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,526
That's what they do.
They make stuff up.

374
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,126
Why couldn't that
have been her, though?

375
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,009
What if she's trying
to tell me something?

376
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,606
Why don't you ever
wanna talk about her or acknowledge her?

377
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,201
I do talk about her.

378
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,044
No, you don't! You just fight with me!

379
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,726
You keep all this chaos
so you can pretend that she never existed.

380
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,366
No, Quinn.

381
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,731
I see her every single day

382
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,210
when I look at you.

383
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,883
Fine. I'll help her,
but you're staying here.

384
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,210
I'm reaching out to Lilith Brenner.

385
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,327
If you can hear me, please answer me.

386
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,848
Your daughter may be in danger.
She needs your help.

387
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,171
Please, Lily, answer me.

388
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,729
I need to speak with you.

389
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,531
Lily, please, show yourself.

390
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,405
What do you want from her?

391
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,850
I know you're not her mother.

392
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,241
She thinks you are, but you aren't.

393
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,570
And I'm not afraid of you.

394
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,451
I know you're there.

395
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,971
I've fought many like you
in my time, demon.

396
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,686
Show yourself.

397
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,485
I can't.

398
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,284
I can't do this anymore.

399
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,729
<i>Kate Wittier is still a bitch.
Mr. Paul is still hot.</i>

400
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,962
<i>Hector is still asking about you
in a really unsubtle way,</i>

401
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,407
<i>like, ugh, he just needs to stop.</i>

402
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,131
<i>And everyone at school is
pretending that they care about prom</i>

403
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,965
<i>and that they're going
to wear ironic costumes.</i>

404
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,486
That sounds so fun.

405
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,609
<i>No, it's not. It's the worst. Believe me.</i>

406
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,325
<i>Oh, I wish someone
would run over my legs with a truck.</i>

407
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,240
Wait. So, how's your
college application going?

408
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,487
<i>No, we're gonna talk about you.</i>

409
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,085
<i>How's it going with your dad?</i>

410
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,922
He's taking all this time off work.

411
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,684
He's out talking to his
boss about it right now.

412
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,967
It's like this whole big situation.

413
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,405
<i>That sucks.</i>

414
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,089
<i>Well, uh, I don't know,</i>

415
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,606
<i>what do you do
when you need to go to the bathroom?</i>

416
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,527
<i>No! No.
No way. You're kidding me!</i>

417
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,568
<i>- Hey, is that Alex?</i>
- What?

418
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,366
<i>Standing right next to you.</i>

419
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,805
What are you talking about?

420
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,008
<i>Um... Alex. He's right...</i>

421
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,201
Maggie?

422
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,965
Maggie?

423
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,481
Quinn!

424
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,803
What's happening? Quinn!

425
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,609
Are you hurt?
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

426
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,330
My neck!

427
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,526
Someone's in here.

428
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,761
There's someone in here?

429
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,609
I'm here now. It's okay.

430
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,566
Ow.

431
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,687
Careful.

432
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,685
This will prevent her
from moving in a way

433
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,160
that could injure her neck further.

434
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,126
- Ow.
- Easy.

435
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,601
Just hold still.

436
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,641
Thank you.

437
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,800
Quinn, what happened?

438
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,009
I was thrown out of bed.

439
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,326
But there was no one in your room.
I would've seen them.

440
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,604
It wasn't a person.

441
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,887
It was...

442
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,849
Before I thought
that it was Mom trying to contact me.

443
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,566
But it's not. It's something else.

444
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,241
Are you sure it wasn't just a bad dream?

445
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,527
No! I saw him.

446
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,444
He had on a mask.

447
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,923
He had on a breathing mask.

448
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,486
I believe you.

449
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,648
I do. You're gonna be okay now.

450
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,801
Get some rest out here.

451
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,283
I think we got
everything we need.

452
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,762
Come on. Thank you very much.

453
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,561
Harry?

454
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,361
She's gone.

455
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,125
She just wouldn't wake up.

456
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,407
Oh, Harry, I'm sorry.

457
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,886
People called her the "cat lady,"
"crazy lady," but she wasn't any of that.

458
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:54,810
She was somebody.
She meant something. She was my wife.

459
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,085
We were together 52 years.

460
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,721
She had a whole life before she got sick.

461
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,326
She was beautiful.

462
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,607
So, so beautiful.

463
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,162
The most beautiful girl in the whole town.

464
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,322
I knew she didn't have long,

465
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,244
and I tried my best
to tell her what she meant to me.

466
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,010
The sad part is

467
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:29,046
I don't think she
understood a word I was trying to say.

468
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,644
She knew what you said.

469
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,883
She knows how much you love her.

470
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,209
Harry, if you ever need anything,

471
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,847
anything, just tell me, okay?

472
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,680
Thanks.

473
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,691
Help. Help!

474
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,765
Help! Help!

475
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,846
Dad.

476
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,811
Dad! Help!

477
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,770
Help!

478
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,250
Help!

479
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,328
Dad! Dad, help me!

480
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,441
- Dad!
- Quinn!

481
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,530
What are you doing up here?

482
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,609
Dad, I told you.

483
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,125
Jesus, he jumped.

484
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,645
- Quinn!
- Dad!

485
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,566
Dad, help! Help!

486
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,121
Quinn. Quinn.

487
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,721
- Who's there?
- It's Sean Brenner.

488
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,930
I'm Quinn's father.

489
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,650
I told her I don't really
give readings anymore.

490
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,047
Believe me, I wanna help,

491
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,168
but this ability I have
to contact the other side,

492
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,925
I promised myself
I wouldn't do it anymore.

493
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,728
Look, I don't know
anything about this stuff.

494
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,926
I don't know what's real, what's not.

495
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,809
I only know her, she's real.

496
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,641
She's my daughter,
and something's trying to kill her,

497
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,768
and I don't know
what to do to stop it.

498
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,765
I can't let that happen again,
not after my wife.

499
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,408
She told me that you lost your wife.

500
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,051
I'm so sorry.

501
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,364
Loving someone
is just delayed pain, isn't it?

502
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,120
Eventually you're gonna lose them
one way or the other.

503
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,322
I lost my husband a year ago.

504
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,811
He took his own life.

505
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,644
So, I couldn't even blame fate.

506
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:12,007
He'd suffered depression before,
but I never thought that...

507
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,844
There are so many things
I needed to say to him.

508
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,005
Goodbye would've been nice.

509
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,846
So, I tried to contact him.
I just couldn't help it.

510
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:46,081
There are two worlds
that exist beyond ours, Mr. Brenner.

511
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,329
Think of them as light and dark.

512
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,725
I visited the dark, looking for him,

513
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,604
something I'd never done before.

514
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,044
Something we living people
are not supposed to do.

515
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,567
But someone followed me back.

516
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:17,444
A woman, an entity driven by evil.

517
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,164
Ever since then,
whenever I use my ability, this woman,

518
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,209
I could hear her in my head,

519
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,241
screaming over and over
that she's going to kill me.

520
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,001
I think...

521
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,370
No, I know if I continue
with this work,

522
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,680
she's going to kill me.

523
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,929
Then just visit Quinn.

524
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,804
It's all I ask.
You don't have to do anything else.

525
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,041
Just talk to her.

526
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,967
Thank you.

527
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,930
We're gonna be okay.

528
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,761
Quinn?

529
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,006
Elise.

530
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,481
You came.

531
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,807
Lucky you look good in white.

532
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:45,644
What's happening to me?

533
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,408
One night after you came to see me,

534
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,246
I had a vision of you.

535
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,049
You were standing in the dark.

536
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,128
A man was walking toward you.

537
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,763
A man who couldn't breathe.

538
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,123
I've been to that dark place, too.

539
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,687
It's not a place for pure souls.

540
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,121
It is very dangerous.

541
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,450
When you go there,

542
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,362
things come back with you.

543
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,323
I don't wanna die, Elise.

544
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,043
You have a long life ahead of you.

545
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,525
I cross my heart.

546
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,051
I'm here with Quinn Brenner.

547
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:45,362
I want to speak to the entity
that has attached itself to her.

548
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,771
Can you hear me?

549
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,606
Are you there?

550
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,050
Where is the man who can't breathe?

551
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,889
I wasn't trying to upset him.

552
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,690
Get away from me! Get away!

553
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,247
I'm not going any further.

554
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:23,251
<i>I always wanted to know how I would go</i>

555
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:28,690
<i>Tell me, friend, how I meet my end</i>

556
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,921
No!

557
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,681
Elise!

558
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,521
Elise. Elise.

559
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,767
Elise! Wake up! Elise!

560
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,249
Wake up! Elise!

561
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:48,246
The woman that wants to kill me
was waiting for me.

562
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,641
I'm sorry. I can't. I can't help you.

563
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,563
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

564
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,888
I'm telling you, Dad.
These guys can help.

565
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,171
<i>Throughout this hospital over the years,</i>

566
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,800
<i>a lot of paranormal experts
have come in here and then the, uh...</i>

567
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,444
I don't know. They look like fools.

568
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,650
They found a house
that was being haunted,

569
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,882
and they cleaned it. Trust me.

570
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,647
I don't.

571
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,602
Dad, we have to do something.

572
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,841
I'm Sean, Quinn's dad.

573
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,046
Hey. Specs.

574
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,248
- Tucker.
- This is Alex.

575
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,889
Yeah, he's a big fan of your website.

576
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,962
- Web series.
- Web series.

577
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,760
I showed him
that one where you guys

578
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,006
get the ghost out
of that one hotel.

579
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,969
- The boiler room ghost?
- Oh, yeah.

580
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,088
- That was a good one.
- Yeah. Thanks, little man.

581
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,730
Some of my best editing on that one.

582
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,240
Definitely some of our best editing.

583
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,682
So, do you guys do this kind of thing often?
This ghost hunting?

584
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,046
All the time.

585
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:57,169
Yeah. It's actually all we do.

586
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:00,722
We literally don't
do anything else. Just this.

587
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,321
So what happens now?

588
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,565
Probably five, maybe four.

589
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:08,561
Excuse me?

590
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,846
And I have to call you back.
I'm just with some peeps.

591
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,160
Roger that.

592
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,011
Come on. She's in here.

593
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,721
Thank you. Pass the trash.

594
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,841
Here you go.

595
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,806
Thanks.

596
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,161
Excuse me.

597
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,609
Now, this
custom-made camera of mine

598
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,250
is outfitted with a small lens.

599
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,723
Basically a hidden camera.

600
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,848
It's not basic and it's not hidden.

601
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,650
'Cause we're keeping it
right out in the open

602
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,609
to capture whatever
may occur tonight.

603
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,330
We do hide it though, sometimes.

604
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,361
Thanks.

605
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,041
This is our sound backup.

606
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,642
Any noises will be
recorded right here.

607
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,448
- What do I do?
- Nothing.

608
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,682
You just go to sleep
like you normally would.

609
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,124
We are
the ones who stay awake.

610
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,166
Hello, Elise.

611
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,891
It's been too long.

612
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,322
I save you for special occasions.

613
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,287
That's her.

614
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,046
She says one day, eventually,

615
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,804
I'm going to die by her hand,

616
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,086
and I believe her.

617
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,642
That's why I had to stop using my gift.

618
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,244
But now I'm realizing

619
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,925
my gift is all I have.

620
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,764
It's all I am.

621
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:02,206
First of all, okay,
you are more than one thing.

622
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,008
And, second,
you've been helping people

623
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,128
get rid of these spirits for so long.

624
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,762
Well, eventually,
one of them was gonna come after you.

625
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,650
You can't be afraid of her.

626
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,968
All right, you're stronger than her.

627
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,290
You're alive.

628
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,771
Yes, I'm alive.

629
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,088
But I have spent more time on this earth

630
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,083
among the dead than the living.

631
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,931
Do you really think we help people, Carl?

632
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,365
We do what we can.

633
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,208
If someone gets attacked
by a person on the street,

634
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,567
they can go to the police.

635
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,564
If they're attacked
by something they can't see,

636
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,881
something they can't comprehend,

637
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,201
they only have people like us to go to.

638
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,327
Here.

639
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,288
Look at what you did for that family.

640
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,207
You saved them.

641
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:59,169
That boy is a grown man now
with a son of his own.

642
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,163
I don't want you to stop
helping families like them.

643
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,004
They need you too much.

644
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,600
What's that?

645
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,011
I don't know.

646
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,486
She's up.

647
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:01,371
What? No. No.

648
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,169
She can't be doing that.
That's impossible.

649
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:04,924
Well, she's doing it.

650
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,088
Go. Go!

651
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,521
She's gone. Come on. Look.

652
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:01,891
I gotta go get her.

653
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,968
Yeah. Good idea. You should.

654
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,647
Quinn?

655
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,201
Quinn?

656
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:37,881
Where are you, honey?

657
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:41,521
Wait.

658
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,810
Here. Keep the flashlight on the closet.

659
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,086
Yeah.

660
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:33,486
She took it off.

661
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,087
Quinn.

662
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,201
Wait.

663
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:56,206
You're a useless fucking father.

664
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:58,282
Your wife had to die
to get away from you.

665
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,361
No.

666
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,647
And now I'd rather be dead, too,

667
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:05,566
but I'm gonna keep you alive
to watch you suffer.

668
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:10,083
I'll be waiting in the dark
when the pain finally kills you.

669
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,565
No! No!

670
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,324
Don't!

671
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:18,961
Quinn!

672
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,245
No! No!

673
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:30,721
Hand me that wire!

674
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,929
Okay! Okay.

675
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:52,321
What do we do now?

676
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,370
I don't know.
We are not qualified for this.

677
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,090
We sit in dark empty rooms.

678
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,161
This is way out of our league!

679
01:10:58,240 --> 01:10:59,241
What do you mean?

680
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,368
Are you telling me
you have no idea how to help us?

681
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,081
No.

682
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,207
Are you saying that

683
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,049
you're a couple of
goddamn Internet pranksters?

684
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,724
I let you in my house, you...

685
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,444
Dad! Stop it, Dad! Stop it!

686
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,567
This isn't going to help Quinn!

687
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,641
Get out! Get out of my house!

688
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,721
Get out!

689
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:16,970
Let them stay.
We may need them.

690
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,644
What? What for?

691
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,209
To help me get rid of the foul parasite

692
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,362
that's attached itself to your daughter.

693
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,526
I need you to stay
at Ernesto's tonight, buddy.

694
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,284
- But I wanna be here.
- I know.

695
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,522
I'm not leaving, Dad.

696
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,370
Alex, we know you love her.

697
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:41,123
But you do not wanna see the things
that tonight may show you.

698
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,605
She's gonna feel your love.

699
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:47,440
Good night, buddy.

700
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:53,641
Now what?

701
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:05,406
This entity is very powerful.

702
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,563
It's a spirit who used to
live in this building a long time ago.

703
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,569
It's been alone for a long time.

704
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,764
But she's making it stronger.

705
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,800
It's feeding on her life force.

706
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,925
And wants to possess her?

707
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,645
Usually, entities of this type,
living in the dark,

708
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,530
they want to possess
the bodies of the living

709
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,809
so that they can
leave the dark and return to life.

710
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,927
But there's another kind of a spirit.

711
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,765
It's an even worse kind.

712
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,046
One that does not wanna leave the dark,

713
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,446
that wants the souls of the living
to join it in the shadows.

714
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,169
She's only half a person right now.

715
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,126
After the accident, it got half her soul.

716
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,491
It needs all of it.

717
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,601
And if we don't hurry,
it's going to get it.

718
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,682
Okay, what do we do now?

719
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,524
To bring all of your daughter back,

720
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,648
I'm going to have to go to where it lives.

721
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,888
You can record everything,
even in the dark?

722
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,247
Yeah, of course. Whatever you need.

723
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,163
I'm the technical part of the team.

724
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,484
Then you better get set up.

725
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:27,926
What's your contribution?

726
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,771
Yeah, this should be good.

727
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,286
It's not good, it's great. It's our blog.

728
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,327
I'm the writer of it.

729
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,803
Okay, then, you write down
everything I describe when I'm under.

730
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,649
If you can keep up, that is.

731
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:50,407
Now, I'm going into another plane.

732
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:54,526
"Into another plane."

733
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,600
Stay strong.

734
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,367
No matter what happens,
no matter what you see.

735
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,602
"No matter what..."

736
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:08,527
Okay, could you just
maybe write it down and try not to talk?

737
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:10,960
Um... Yeah. Yeah.

738
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:17,806
Uh... Sorry. Does this
other plane have a name?

739
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,969
Let's call it "The Further."

740
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,689
- Cool name.
- Now, we're going to be quiet.

741
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:38,401
Into The Further, we go.

742
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,531
I'm here. It's dark.

743
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,928
I'm entering the hallway.

744
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,042
You lived in this building, too?

745
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,764
He made you kill yourself, didn't he?
Where is he?

746
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,241
Show me.

747
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,523
We're going upstairs.

748
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,923
His voice was always in my head.

749
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,285
I was his pet.

750
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,842
He's got a new pet. The girl.

751
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,882
Quinn is his new pet.

752
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:54,961
There's no undoing.

753
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:58,086
You can't even kill yourself
to get away from it.

754
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,046
It's okay. You're free now.

755
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:16,202
I can hear it breathing.

756
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,167
I hear it.

757
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,406
Turn around.

758
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,444
You're stronger than her. You're alive.

759
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,969
This is how you die.

760
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,042
Not today, it isn't.

761
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:28,846
Come on, bitch.

762
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:47,841
Let her go.

763
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,601
Do you hear me? Release the girl!

764
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:59,680
Jack?

765
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:01,966
Hi, Ellie.

766
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,241
Come.

767
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,326
Sit here with me.

768
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:07,481
What are you doing here?

769
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,568
Well, I could feel you were here.

770
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,204
I had to find you.

771
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,362
Oh, I've missed you so much.

772
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:21,285
I know. I know.

773
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,041
Oh...

774
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,250
How am I...
How am I supposed to move on?

775
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:35,483
I never even got to say goodbye.

776
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,489
Well, maybe you can move on.

777
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:42,450
I can't exist anywhere without you.

778
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:47,040
So, I wanted
to ask you to join me here.

779
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,207
You'd have to leave
your other world behind.

780
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,762
Stop breathing in it, like I did.

781
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:57,405
Stay with me here.

782
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,649
You'll have to do it yourself.

783
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,286
I can't help you.

784
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,644
Don't you want to be with me?

785
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,646
Want.

786
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,123
"Want" is not a strong enough word.

787
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:28,684
I know my turn to cross over will come.

788
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:34,651
But I know that my Jack
would never ask me to do this.

789
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,241
Demon.

790
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,886
Give me the girl now
or I'll do a whole lot worse!

791
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:02,881
Give her back.

792
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:33,770
You may have half of her,
but I am whole,

793
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,608
and I am very strong.

794
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:46,927
Oh!

795
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,686
Go! Go, go!

796
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,729
Elise, wake up! Elise!

797
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,361
Elise!

798
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,684
This way. This way.

799
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:23,726
- Quinn?
- Honey?

800
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:25,080
- Quinn!
- Honey, please.

801
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,762
- What's happening to her?
- It's got her.

802
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,729
Wake up. Don't let it take you.
Grab her hands!

803
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:41,365
Quinn, don't leave! Don't leave!

804
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,247
Stay with us!

805
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,046
This world is your home!

806
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,963
Not that one! This one!

807
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,080
What's happening? Is she dying?

808
01:22:58,160 --> 01:22:59,321
Just hold on to her.

809
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,845
- Is she?
- Yes.

810
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,922
No! No! Bring her back!
Bring her back!

811
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,929
You said you could
bring her back!

812
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,441
- You need to help me. Quinn!
- What?

813
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,522
- Quinn, Quinn, hear us!
- Quinn.

814
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,204
- Come back to us!
- Quinn!

815
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,481
What are you doing?

816
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:22,811
There's another woman here
who died in this building a few days ago.

817
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,008
Yeah. Grace.
Grace, the neighbor's wife.

818
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:28,482
She's saying something to me.
I can't hear it exactly.

819
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,000
- What is she saying?
- Honey, please!

820
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,451
What book?
Grace, what book?

821
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:32,681
Hurry!

822
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:34,091
Hurry! Elise, hurry!

823
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:37,327
Quinn's diary.

824
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,401
This is it. "Quinn, I wanted you to find
this on the day you graduated."

825
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,046
This is the letter
that Lily hid from Quinn.

826
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,726
She wanted her to find it
on her graduation day.

827
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,609
She tried to get
her to read it early.

828
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,682
She was trying to reach Quinn.

829
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,046
Quinn!

830
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,884
Lily, I know you were
trying to reach her.

831
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,611
We know that you wanted her
to read this letter.

832
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:00,922
Lily, we need you now!

833
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:03,441
Help us.

834
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:04,527
Dad.

835
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:14,085
Thank you.

836
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:15,491
We had some help.

837
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:18,841
Who?

838
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,844
Someone else is here with us.

839
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:28,650
Someone who really wants to talk to you.

840
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,801
Mom.

841
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:41,726
I need to know that this is real.

842
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,040
Okay.

843
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:51,731
She's saying something
about a stage, an audition.

844
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,125
She says that when
you were on stage,

845
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,362
you wanted to know
if she was there.

846
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:00,925
She was there.

847
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,481
<i>And she was so proud of you.</i>

848
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:15,847
She wants you, and you, Sean,

849
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,605
to know that you
don't need to look for her anymore.

850
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:24,082
Because she'll always be with you.
No matter what.

851
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:28,006
She's gonna be standing
right beside you.

852
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:30,327
And even though
you can't see her, she's there.

853
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:37,528
And anytime you're feeling
confused or alone,

854
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,041
she's gonna be
whispering in your ear.

855
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:49,684
She's never coming back again, is she?

856
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:53,730
Not to this world.

857
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,561
I love you.

858
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:18,606
Good job, boys.

859
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:48,966
Careful.

860
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:53,921
Thanks.

861
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,967
Is that the first time
you've seen a ghost?

862
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,565
- Well...
- Yes.

863
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,970
You never get used to it.

864
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:09,284
Spectral Sightings, I like that.

865
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,486
That one's mine.

866
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:11,686
Is it?

867
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:14,604
Stop. You boys fight too much.

868
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:17,650
It's unnecessary.
It's clear you both need each other.

869
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,568
Maybe we should go
into business together?

870
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,971
I thought you said
this business was too dangerous for you

871
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:29,122
and you said it could kill you.

872
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:33,689
Yeah. Well, everybody's
gonna die one day.

873
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,328
I think it is high time

874
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:40,324
for me to get out
of my house while I'm still alive.

875
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,081
What do you think?

876
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:45,521
Yes?

877
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:46,965
- Yeah.
- Sure.

878
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:49,247
Well then, take me to my car.

879
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:53,121
- Oh...
- That's great.

880
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:55,646
I also think
that you guys should think

881
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:57,370
about wearing something
a little better,

882
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,522
if we're gonna be working together.

883
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,523
I'll have you know
this tee is extremely rare.

884
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,125
Well, I'm sure it is.

885
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,804
