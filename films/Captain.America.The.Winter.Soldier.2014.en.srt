1
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,176
On your left.

2
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,104
On your left.

3
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:04,232
Uh-huh. On my left. Got it.

4
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:11,364
Don't say it. Don't you say it.

5
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:12,990
- On your left. - Come on!

6
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,826
Oh!

7
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:23,417
Need a medic?

8
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:27,838
I need a new set of lungs.

9
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:31,259
Dude, you just ran, like, 13 miles in 30 minutes.

10
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:32,343
I guess I got a late start.

11
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,054
Really? You should be ashamed of yourself.

12
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,765
You should take another lap.

13
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:40,017
Did you just take it? I assume you just took it.

14
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:41,769
What unit you with?

15
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:43,312
58th Pararescue.

16
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,022
But now I'm working down at the VA.

17
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,358
- Sam Wilson. - Steve Rogers.

18
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,694
I kind of put that together.

19
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,322
Must have freaked you out, coming home after the whole defrosting thing.

20
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,866
It takes some getting used to.

21
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,451
It's good to meet you, Sam.

22
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:58,869
It's your bed, right?

23
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:01,038
What's that?

24
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:02,623
Your bed, it's too soft.

25
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,458
When I was over there, I'd sleep on the ground,

26
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,544
use rock for pillows, like a caveman.

27
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,880
Now I'm home, lying in my bed, and it's like...

28
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:11,257
Lying on a marshmallow.

29
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,009
Feel like I'm gonna sink right to the floor.

30
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:15,636
How long?

31
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,013
Two tours.

32
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,473
You must miss the good old days, huh?

33
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:22,893
Well, things aren't so bad.

34
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,479
Food's a lot better. We used to boil everything.

35
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:26,856
No polio is good.

36
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,190
Internet, so helpful.

37
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,775
I've been reading that a lot, trying to catch up.

38
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:35,906
Marvin Gaye, 1972, Trouble Man soundtrack.

39
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:38,576
Everything you missed jammed into one album.

40
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:40,703
I'll put it on the list.

41
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:51,047
All right, Sam, duty calls. Thanks for the run.

42
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:52,590
If that's what you want to call running.

43
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:53,799
Oh, that's how it is?

44
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:54,925
- Oh, that's how it is. - Okay.

45
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,929
Any time you want to stop by the VA, make me look awesome

46
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:02,433
in front of the girl at the front desk, just let me know.

47
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,226
- I'll keep it in mind. - Yeah.

48
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,774
Hey, fellas.

49
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,734
Either one of you know where the Smithsonian is?

50
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,152
I'm here to pick up a fossil.

51
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:14,612
That's hilarious.

52
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:20,618
- How you doing? - Hey.

53
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:23,371
Can't run everywhere.

54
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:24,455
No, you can't.

55
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,423
Target is a mobile satellite launch platform,

56
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:35,633
the Lemurian Star.

57
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,094
They were sending up their last payload when pirates took them,

58
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,012
93 minutes ago.

59
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:41,972
- Any demands? - Billion and a half.

60
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,808
- Why so steep? - Because it's S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

61
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,978
So it's not off-course. It's trespassing.

62
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,647
I'm sure they have a good reason.

63
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,524
You know, I'm getting a little tired of being Fury's janitor.

64
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,567
Relax. It's not that complicated.

65
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:54,860
How many pirates?

66
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:57,488
25. Top mercs led by this guy.

67
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,742
Georges Batroc. Ex-DGSE, Action Division.

68
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:03,828
He's at the top of Interpol's Red Notice.

69
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:07,665
Before the French demobilised him, he had 36 kill missions.

70
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,500
This guy's got a rep for maximum casualties.

71
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,960
Hostages?

72
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,921
Oh, mostly techs. One officer. Jasper Sitwell.

73
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,840
They're in the galley.

74
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,466
What's Sitwell doing on a launch ship?

75
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,510
All right, I'm gonna sweep the deck and find Batroc.

76
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:21,178
Nat, you kill the engines and wait for instructions.

77
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:24,181
Rumlow, you sweep aft, find the hostages,

78
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,142
get them to the life-pods, get them out. Let's move.

79
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,351
S.T.R.I.K.E., you heard the Cap. Gear up.

80
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,575
Secure channel seven.

81
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:43,784
Seven secure.

82
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:45,411
Did you do anything fun Saturday night?

83
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:49,039
Well, all the guys from my barbershop quartet are dead,

84
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,749
so, no, not really.

85
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,043
Coming up on the drop zone, Cap.

86
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:56,255
You know, if you ask Kristen out, from Statistics, she'd probably say yes.

87
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:58,132
That's why I don't ask.

88
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,635
Too shy, or too scared?

89
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:03,762
Too busy!

90
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,807
Was he wearing a parachute?

91
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:08,058
No.

92
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:09,727
No, he wasn't.

93
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:39,727
Subtitle www.movieddl.me

94
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:11,956
Ahh!

95
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:19,630
Ahh!

96
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,177
Hey!

97
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,050
Don't move.

98
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,222
Thanks.

99
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,474
Yeah. You seemed pretty helpless without me.

100
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:18,814
What about the nurse that lives across the hall from you?

101
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:19,940
She seems kind of nice.

102
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:21,650
Secure the engine room, then find me a date.

103
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,444
I'm multi-tasking.

104
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,863
I told Batroc...

105
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,489
If we want to make S.H.I.E.L.D. pay us...

106
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,783
...start sending them bodies now!

107
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,704
I have a bullet for someone...

108
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,040
You want a bullet in your head?

109
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:37,875
Move that foot - you want a bullet in the head...?

110
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,877
Huh?

111
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,720
I don't like waiting.

112
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,014
Call Durand.

113
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,309
I want this ship ready to move when the ransom comes.

114
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,068
Start the engines.

115
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,486
Okay.

116
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:07,821
Hey, sailor.

117
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:28,634
Shut up.

118
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,262
You want to be a hero? Is that it?

119
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,979
All right, I've waited long enough...

120
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,567
Hey!

121
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:46,652
Find Batroc...

122
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:47,736
If I don't hear anything in two minutes...

123
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,071
...I start killing them!

124
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,280
I'll find him.

125
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:00,249
Two minutes.

126
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,991
Radio silence from S.H.I.E.L.D., Batroc...

127
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,413
Targets acquired.

128
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,165
S.T.R.I.K.E. in position.

129
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,333
Natasha, what's your status?

130
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,004
Status, Natasha.

131
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,172
Hang on!

132
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,355
Engine room secure.

133
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,073
Time is up.

134
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:18,076
Who dies first...?

135
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,537
You!

136
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:21,622
Get that one.

137
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,209
On my mark.

138
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,003
Three...

139
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:29,505
Two... One.

140
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,889
I told you, S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't negotiate.

141
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,019
The line just went dead.

142
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:45,729
I've lost contact with them...

143
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,066
Ahh!

144
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,411
Hostages en route to extraction.

145
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,706
Romanoff missed the rendezvous point, Cap.

146
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,251
Hostiles are still in play.

147
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,753
Natasha, Batroc's on the move.

148
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:12,005
Circle back to Rumlow and protect the hostages.

149
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,049
Natasha.

150
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:52,212
I thought you were more than just a shield...

151
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,978
Let's see.

152
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,297
Well, this is awkward.

153
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:39,927
What are you doing?

154
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,303
Backing up the hard drive.

155
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,804
It's a good habit to get into.

156
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:44,348
Rumlow needed your help.

157
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:45,766
What the hell are you doing here?

158
00:12:49,353 --> 00:12:50,562
You're saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.

159
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,980
Whatever I can get my hands on.

160
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,523
Our mission is to rescue hostages.

161
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,484
No, that's your mission,

162
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,278
and you've done it beautifully.

163
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,239
You just jeopardised this whole operation.

164
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,783
I think that's overstating things.

165
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:21,927
Okay.

166
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:23,845
That one's on me.

167
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,223
You're damn right.

168
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:57,170
You just can't stop yourself from lying, can you?

169
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,296
I didn't lie.

170
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,715
Agent Romanoff had a different mission than yours.

171
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,675
Which you didn't feel obliged to share.

172
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,427
I'm not obliged to do anything.

173
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,012
Those hostages could have died, Nick.

174
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,807
I sent the greatest soldier in history to make sure that didn't happen.

175
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,101
Soldiers trust each other. That's what makes it an army.

176
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,936
Not a bunch of guys running around shooting guns.

177
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:16,314
Last time I trusted someone, I lost an eye.

178
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:20,736
Look, I didn't want you doing anything you weren't comfortable with.

179
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,988
Agent Romanoff is comfortable with everything.

180
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,364
I can't lead a mission

181
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,283
when the people I'm leading have missions of their own.

182
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,119
It's called compartmentalisation.

183
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,997
Nobody spills the secrets, because nobody knows them all.

184
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:33,915
Except you.

185
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,171
You're wrong about me.

186
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,256
I do share.

187
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:44,009
I'm nice like that.

188
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:46,970
Insight bay.

189
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,138
Captain Rogers does not have

190
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,514
clearance for Project Insight.

191
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,184
Director override. Fury, Nicholas J.

192
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:53,894
Confirmed.

193
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,315
You know, they used to play music.

194
00:14:58,982 --> 00:14:59,983
Yeah.

195
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,737
My grandfather operated one of these things for 40 years.

196
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,239
Granddad worked in a nice building.

197
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:07,657
Got good tips.

198
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:12,329
He'd walk home every night, a roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.

199
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:13,830
He'd say, "Hi."

200
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,916
People would say, "Hi" back.

201
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,127
Time went on, the neighbourhood got rougher.

202
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:20,212
He'd say, "Hi."

203
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,756
They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."

204
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,050
Granddad got to gripping that lunch bag a little tighter.

205
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,010
Did he ever get mugged?

206
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,973
Every week some punk would say, "What's in the bag?"

207
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,850
What would he do?

208
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,185
He'd show them.

209
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,231
Bunch of crumpled ones, and a loaded .22 Magnum.

210
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,070
Yeah, Granddad loved people.

211
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,323
But he didn't trust them very much.

212
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,831
Yeah, I know.

213
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,375
They're a little bit bigger than a .22.

214
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:35,120
This is Project Insight.

215
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,497
Three next-generation helicarriers

216
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,375
synced to a network of targeting satellites.

217
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:42,335
Launched from the Lemurian Star.

218
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,505
Once we get them in the air, they never need to come down.

219
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:50,594
Continuous sub-orbital flight, courtesy of our new repulsor engines.

220
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,095
Stark?

221
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,388
He had a few suggestions

222
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,807
once he got an up-close look at our old turbines.

223
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,102
These new long-range precision guns

224
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,730
can eliminate 1,000 hostiles a minute.

225
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:06,109
The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA before he steps outside his spider hole.

226
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,404
We're gonna neutralise a lot of threats before they even happen.

227
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,489
Thought the punishment usually came after the crime.

228
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,116
We can't afford to wait that long.

229
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:14,784
Who's "we"?

230
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,245
After New York, I convinced the World Security Council

231
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:19,706
we needed a quantum surge in threat analysis.

232
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,792
For once, we're way ahead of the curve.

233
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,463
By holding a gun to everyone on Earth and calling it protection.

234
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,133
You know, I read those SSR files.

235
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,010
"Greatest Generation"?

236
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,387
You guys did some nasty stuff.

237
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,139
Yeah, we compromised.

238
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,475
Sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well.

239
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,228
But we did it so that people could be free.

240
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,647
This isn't freedom. This is fear.

241
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:47,192
S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be.

242
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,363
And it's getting damn near past time for you to get with that programme, Cap.

243
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:54,199
Don't hold your breath.

244
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,844
Welcome to the Smithsonian.

245
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:18,515
Visitor information booths are available on the second level.

246
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,693
A symbol to the nation.

247
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,654
A hero to the world.

248
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:39,869
The story of Captain America is one of honour, bravery and sacrifice.

249
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,335
Denied enlistment due to poor health,

250
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,754
Steven Rogers was chosen for a programme

251
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:53,091
unique in the annals of American warfare.

252
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:59,055
One that would transform him into the world's first Super-Soldier.

253
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:06,730
In this rare footage,

254
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,232
everyone's favourite war hero, Captain America...

255
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,900
Battle tested,

256
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,068
Captain America

257
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:15,572
and his Howling Commandos quickly earned their stripes.

258
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:16,781
Their mission:

259
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:20,785
taking down HYDRA, the Nazi rogue science division.

260
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,124
Best friends since childhood,

261
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,420
Bucky Barnes and Steven Rogers were inseparable

262
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,464
on both schoolyard and battlefield.

263
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:37,927
Barnes is the only Howling Commando to give his life

264
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,638
in service of his country.

265
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,312
That was a difficult winter.

266
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,982
A blizzard had trapped half our battalion behind the German line.

267
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:54,819
Steve, Captain Rogers,

268
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,655
he fought his way through a HYDRA blockade

269
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,408
that had pinned our allies down for months.

270
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,787
He saved over 1,000 men.

271
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:06,373
Including the man who would...

272
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:10,627
Who would become my husband, as it turned out.

273
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:14,297
Even after he died, Steve was still changing my life.

274
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,802
You should be proud of yourself, Peggy.

275
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,184
Mmm.

276
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,312
I have lived a life.

277
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,442
My only regret is that you didn't get to live yours.

278
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:38,696
What is it?

279
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,911
For as long as I can remember, I just wanted to do what was right.

280
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,665
I guess I'm not quite sure what that is any more.

281
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:55,922
And I thought I could throw myself back in and follow orders.

282
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,465
Serve.

283
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,720
It's just not the same.

284
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:04,722
You're always so dramatic.

285
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:11,563
Look, you saved the world.

286
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:17,861
We rather mucked it up.

287
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:19,529
You didn't.

288
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:23,783
Knowing that you helped found S.H.I.E.L.D. is half the reason I stay.

289
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:25,660
Hey.

290
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:32,750
The world has changed, and none of us can go back.

291
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,129
All we can do is our best.

292
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:40,550
And sometimes the best that we can do is to start over.

293
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:49,058
Peggy.

294
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:55,899
Steve.

295
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:57,775
Yeah?

296
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:00,737
You're alive.

297
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:04,491
You came back.

298
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:05,742
Yeah, Peggy.

299
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:11,539
It's been so long.

300
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,543
So long.

301
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:19,130
Well, I couldn't leave my best girl.

302
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,424
Not when she owes me a dance.

303
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,806
Secure office.

304
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:39,609
Open Lemurian Star's satellite launch file.

305
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,362
Access denied.

306
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:44,072
Run decryption.

307
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,618
Decryption failed.

308
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:51,496
Director override. Fury, Nicholas J.

309
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,543
Override denied. All files sealed.

310
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,211
On whose authority?

311
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,630
Fury, Nicholas J.

312
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,303
World Security Council.

313
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,680
Confirmed.

314
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,601
if Nick Fury thinks he can get his costumed thugs

315
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,021
and S.T.R.I.K.E. commandos to mop up his mess, he's sadly mistaken.

316
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,398
This failure is unacceptable.

317
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,191
Considering this attack took place

318
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,151
one mile from my country's sovereign waters,

319
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,737
it's a bit more than that. I move for immediate hearing.

320
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,823
We don't need hearings, we need action.

321
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,117
It's this Council's duty to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D.

322
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,286
A breach like this raises serious questions.

323
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:33,162
Like how the hell did a French pirate

324
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:37,250
manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel in broad daylight?

325
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,502
For the record, Councilman, he's Algerian.

326
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,171
I can draw a map if it'd help.

327
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:45,174
I appreciate your wit, Secretary Pierce.

328
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,928
But this Council takes things like international piracy fairly seriously.

329
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,348
Really? I don't.

330
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:56,352
I don't care about one boat, I care about the fleet.

331
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:00,273
If this Council is going to fall to rancour

332
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:03,026
every time someone pushes us on the playing field,

333
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:06,321
maybe we need someone to oversee us.

334
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:09,032
Mr Secretary, nobody is suggesting...

335
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,162
Excuse me.

336
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:15,830
More trouble, Mr Secretary?

337
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,624
Depends on your definition.

338
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:29,469
I work 40 floors away and it takes a hijacking for you to visit?

339
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,763
A nuclear war would do it, too.

340
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,182
You busy in there?

341
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,892
Nothing some earmarks can't fix.

342
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:41,189
I'm here to ask a favour.

343
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,858
I want you to call for a vote.

344
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:46,152
Project Insight has to be delayed.

345
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,738
Nick, that's not a favour,

346
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,448
that's a sub-committee hearing. A long one.

347
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,283
It could be nothing. It probably is nothing.

348
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:55,119
I just need time to make sure it's nothing.

349
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,371
But if it's something?

350
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:59,374
Then we'll both be damn glad those helicarriers aren't in the air.

351
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:02,460
Fine.

352
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:06,714
But you got to get Iron Man to stop by my niece's birthday party.

353
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:08,508
Thank you, sir.

354
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,594
And not just a flyby. He's got to mingle.

355
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,431
The thing is,

356
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:18,017
I think it's getting worse.

357
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,562
A cop pulled me over last week.

358
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,022
He thought I was drunk.

359
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,694
I swerved to miss a plastic bag.

360
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:30,905
I thought it was an IED.

361
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,076
Some stuff you leave there.

362
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,453
Other stuff you bring back.

363
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,540
It's our job to figure out how to carry it.

364
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:44,919
Is it gonna be in a big suitcase, or in a little man-purse?

365
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:47,130
It's up to you.

366
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,674
- I'll see you next week. - Definitely.

367
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:54,011
Look who it is, the running man.

368
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,306
Caught the last few minutes. It's pretty intense.

369
00:25:57,515 --> 00:26:00,476
Yeah, brother, we all got the same problems.

370
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:02,395
Guilt,

371
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,063
regret.

372
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,190
You lose someone?

373
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:09,235
My wingman, Riley.

374
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,320
Flying a night mission.

375
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,823
Standard PJ rescue op.

376
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,075
Nothing we hadn't done 1,000 times before.

377
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:19,871
Until an RPG knocked Riley's dumb ass out of the sky.

378
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:23,332
Nothing I could do.

379
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,918
It's like I was up there just to watch.

380
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,005
- I'm sorry. - After that,

381
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:32,800
I had a really hard time finding a reason for being over there, you know?

382
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:37,013
But you're happy now, back in the world?

383
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:41,476
The number of people giving me orders is down to about zero.

384
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:42,685
So, hell yeah.

385
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:44,854
Are you thinking about getting out?

386
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:46,856
No.

387
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,026
I don't know.

388
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:54,113
To be honest, I don't know what I would do with myself if I did.

389
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:55,656
Ultimate fighting?

390
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:58,868
Just a great idea off the top of my head.

391
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:01,454
Seriously, you could do whatever you want to do.

392
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:03,498
What makes you happy?

393
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,084
I don't know.

394
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:11,339
Activating communications encryption protocol.

395
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,841
Open secure line 0405.

396
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,343
Confirmed.

397
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:17,762
This is Hill.

398
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:19,764
I need you here in D.C.

399
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:22,683
Deep shadow conditions.

400
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:24,519
Give me four hours.

401
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,187
You have three. Over.

402
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,121
Want to see my lease?

403
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:03,266
Fracture detected.

404
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:08,813
Recommend an aesthetic injection.

405
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:16,863
D.C. Metro Police dispatch shows no units in this area.

406
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,202
Get me out of here.

407
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:27,206
Propulsion systems offline.

408
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,332
Then reboot, damn it!

409
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,730
Warning. Window integrity compromised.

410
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,398
You think?

411
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,861
How long to propulsion?

412
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:57,945
Calculating.

413
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:04,285
Window integrity 31%. Deploying countermeasures.

414
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:05,620
Hold that order!

415
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,457
Window integrity 19%.

416
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:10,708
Offensive measures advised.

417
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:12,126
Wait!

418
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,256
Window integrity 1%.

419
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,466
Now!

420
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:30,519
Propulsion systems now online.

421
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:31,854
Full acceleration! Now!

422
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:49,288
Initiate vertical takeoff!

423
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:50,456
Flight systems damaged.

424
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,500
Then activate guidance cameras!

425
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:56,879
Give me the wheel!

426
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:05,763
Get me Agent Hill.

427
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:07,181
Communications array damaged.

428
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:08,891
Well, what's not damaged?

429
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,227
Air conditioning is fully operational.

430
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,073
Traffic ahead.

431
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,116
Give me an alternate route.

432
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:27,034
Traffic alert on Roosevelt Bridge.

433
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:28,452
All vehicles stopped.

434
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:32,081
17th Avenue clear in three blocks, directly ahead.

435
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:09,720
Warning. Approaching intersection.

436
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:20,856
Get me off the grid!

437
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,775
Calculating route to secure location.

438
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:40,436
So sweet. That is so nice.

439
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:42,438
Hi.

440
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:43,856
I got to go, though.

441
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:45,858
Okay. Bye.

442
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,652
My aunt, she's kind of an insomniac.

443
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:51,405
Yeah.

444
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:54,074
Hey, if you want...

445
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:56,452
If you want, you're welcome to use my machine.

446
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,204
Might be cheaper than the one in the basement.

447
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,539
Oh, yeah? What's it cost?

448
00:34:01,498 --> 00:34:03,209
A cup of coffee?

449
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:07,630
Thank you, but

450
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:09,882
I already have a load in downstairs,

451
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,927
and you really don't want my scrubs in your machine.

452
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:16,138
I just finished a rotation in the infectious disease ward, so...

453
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:18,307
Well, I'll keep my distance.

454
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:19,642
Hopefully, not too far.

455
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,188
Oh, and I think you left your stereo on.

456
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:25,731
Oh.

457
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,274
Right. Thank you.

458
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:28,484
Yeah.

459
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,031
I don't remember giving you a key.

460
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,035
You really think I'd need one?

461
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:23,664
My wife kicked me out.

462
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:26,500
I didn't know you were married.

463
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:30,212
A lot of things you don't know about me.

464
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:32,881
I know, Nick. That's the problem.

465
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:51,025
I'm sorry to have to do this, but I had no place else to crash.

466
00:35:58,282 --> 00:35:59,700
Who else knows about your wife?

467
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:03,537
Just...

468
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,875
My friends.

469
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,626
Is that what we are?

470
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:11,712
That's up to you.

471
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:13,547
Ahh!

472
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:33,692
Don't trust anyone.

473
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:37,780
Captain Rogers?

474
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:40,824
Captain,

475
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,118
I'm Agent 13 of S.H.I.E.L.D. Special Service.

476
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,453
Kate?

477
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,164
I'm assigned to protect you.

478
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:48,540
On whose order?

479
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,793
His.

480
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,549
Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive.

481
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:58,759
I need EMTs.

482
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,469
Do we have a 20 on the shooter?

483
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,471
Tell him I'm in pursuit.

484
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,116
Is he gonna make it?

485
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,659
I don't know.

486
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:08,704
Tell me about the shooter.

487
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,039
He's fast. Strong.

488
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:15,252
Had a metal arm.

489
00:38:20,591 --> 00:38:21,842
Ballistics?

490
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:25,929
Three slugs, no rifling. Completely untraceable.

491
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,389
Soviet-made.

492
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,391
Yeah.

493
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:31,560
He's in V-tach.

494
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:32,644
Crash cart coming in.

495
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:33,687
Nurse, help me with the drape.

496
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:34,897
- BP's dropping. - Defibrillator!

497
00:38:37,733 --> 00:38:39,151
I want you to charge him at 100.

498
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,736
Don't do this to me, Nick.

499
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,196
Stand back.

500
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:43,572
Three, two,

501
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:45,491
one. Clear.

502
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,327
- Pulse? - No pulse.

503
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:49,745
Okay, 200, please.

504
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:50,954
Stand back!

505
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:53,415
Three, two, one. Clear!

506
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,583
Get me epinephrine!

507
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:56,835
Pulse?

508
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:57,920
Negative.

509
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:02,591
Don't do this to me, Nick. Don't do this to me.

510
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:23,904
What's the time?

511
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,072
03, Doctor.

512
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,952
Time of death, 1 :03 a.m.

513
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,032
I need to take him.

514
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:24,089
Natasha.

515
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:38,979
Natasha!

516
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:41,898
Why was Fury in your apartment?

517
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:45,027
I don't know.

518
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:46,695
Cap, they want you back at S.H.I.E.L.D.

519
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:48,363
Yeah, give me a second.

520
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,489
They want you now.

521
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:52,159
Okay.

522
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:57,414
You're a terrible liar.

523
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,130
S.T.R.I.K.E. team, escort Captain Rogers

524
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,716
back to S.H.I.E.L.D. immediately for questioning.

525
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:09,343
I told him.

526
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:17,851
- Let's go. - Yeah.

527
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:20,687
S.T.R.I.K.E., move it out.

528
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:37,579
Captain Rogers.

529
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,081
Neighbour.

530
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:42,834
Oh. Captain.

531
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:44,294
I'm Alexander Pierce.

532
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,338
Sir, it's an honour.

533
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:47,589
The honour's mine, Captain.

534
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:50,258
My father served in the 101st. Come on in.

535
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:54,054
That photo was taken five years after Nick and I met,

536
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,640
when I was at State Department in Bogota.

537
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,309
E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,

538
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:03,772
and security got me out, but the rebels took hostages.

539
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:07,442
Nick was Deputy Chief of the S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,

540
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:08,902
and he comes to me with a plan.

541
00:42:09,111 --> 00:42:10,946
He wants to storm the building through the sewers.

542
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:13,907
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

543
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:18,495
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate, so they put out a kill order.

544
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:20,831
They stormed the basement, and what do they find?

545
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,457
They find it empty.

546
00:42:23,709 --> 00:42:25,544
Nick had ignored my direct order,

547
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:29,089
and carried out an unauthorised military operation on foreign soil,

548
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:31,883
and saved the lives of a dozen political officers,

549
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:33,301
including my daughter.

550
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:35,053
So you gave him a promotion.

551
00:42:35,262 --> 00:42:36,805
I've never had any cause to regret it.

552
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,101
Captain, why was Nick in your apartment last night?

553
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,273
I don't know.

554
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:48,859
Did you know it was bugged?

555
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,070
I did, because Nick told me.

556
00:42:52,571 --> 00:42:55,031
Did he tell you he was the one who bugged it?

557
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:02,998
I want you to see something.

558
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,167
Who hired you, Batroc?

559
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,460
Is that live?

560
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:10,213
Yeah, they picked him up last night in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

561
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:12,799
Are you saying he's a suspect?

562
00:43:12,883 --> 00:43:14,509
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

563
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:17,512
No, no. It's more complicated than that.

564
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,265
Batroc was hired anonymously to attack the Lemurian Star.

565
00:43:20,474 --> 00:43:23,977
And he was contacted by email and paid by wire transfer,

566
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:28,565
and then the money was run through 17 fictitious accounts.

567
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:31,026
The last one going to a holding company

568
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:33,403
that was registered to a Jacob Veech.

569
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:34,905
Am I supposed to know who that is?

570
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,115
Not likely. Veech died six years ago.

571
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:40,243
His last address was 1435 Elmhurst Drive.

572
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:44,289
When I first met Nick, his mother lived at 1437.

573
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:49,252
Are you saying Fury hired the pirates? Why?

574
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:51,421
The prevailing theory

575
00:43:52,506 --> 00:43:55,300
was that the hijacking was a cover for the acquisition

576
00:43:55,509 --> 00:43:57,886
and sale of classified intelligence.

577
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:02,516
The sale went sour and that led to Nick's death.

578
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:08,438
If you really knew Nick Fury, you'd know that's not true.

579
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:11,775
Why do you think we're talking?

580
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,948
See, I took a seat on the Council not because I wanted to,

581
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:21,910
but because Nick asked me to, because we were both realists.

582
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:27,707
We knew that, despite all the diplomacy and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

583
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:30,919
to build a really better world

584
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:34,798
sometimes means having to tear the old one down.

585
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,468
And that makes enemies.

586
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:43,640
Those people that call you dirty because you got the guts

587
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:46,601
to stick your hands in the mud and try to build something better.

588
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:50,689
And the idea that those people could be happy today

589
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,609
makes me really, really angry.

590
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:00,866
Captain, you were the last one to see Nick alive.

591
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:02,951
I don't think that's an accident.

592
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:05,120
And I don't think you do, either.

593
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:09,165
So, I'm gonna ask again.

594
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:11,376
Why was he there?

595
00:45:14,296 --> 00:45:16,590
He told me not to trust anyone.

596
00:45:18,842 --> 00:45:21,052
I wonder if that included him.

597
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:27,142
I'm sorry.

598
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:28,602
Those were his last words.

599
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:31,438
Excuse me.

600
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,318
Captain,

601
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:39,529
somebody murdered my friend and I'm gonna find out why.

602
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:42,991
Anyone gets in my way, they're gonna regret it.

603
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:45,744
Anyone.

604
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:50,123
Understood.

605
00:46:07,641 --> 00:46:09,059
Operations Control.

606
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,644
Confirmed.

607
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,272
Keep all S.T.R.I.K.E. personnel on site.

608
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:15,690
- Understood. - Yes, sir.

609
00:46:15,899 --> 00:46:17,108
- Forensics. - Confirmed.

610
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:18,485
Cap.

611
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:19,861
Rumlow.

612
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:32,207
Evidence Response found some fibres on the roof they want us to see.

613
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:33,959
You want me to get the tac team ready?

614
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:35,710
No, let's wait and see what it is first.

615
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:36,962
Right.

616
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,517
What's the status so far?

617
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:53,353
- Administrations level. - Confirmed.

618
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:55,355
Excuse me.

619
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:05,865
I'm sorry about what happened with Fury.

620
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:08,034
It's messed up, what happened to him.

621
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:09,577
Thank you.

622
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:29,556
Records.

623
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:30,890
Confirmed.

624
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:48,575
Before we get started,

625
00:47:49,284 --> 00:47:51,286
does anyone want to get out?

626
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:27,197
Mobilise S.T.R.I.K.E. units, 25th floor.

627
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:43,838
Whoa, big guy.

628
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:47,634
I just want you to know, Cap, this isn't personal!

629
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:00,522
It kind of feels personal.

630
00:49:09,531 --> 00:49:11,533
Drop the shield and put your hands in the air!

631
00:49:28,258 --> 00:49:30,718
Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open!

632
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:32,554
You have nowhere to go!

633
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:53,491
Are you kidding me?

634
00:49:53,575 --> 00:49:55,702
He's headed for the garage. Lock down the bridge.

635
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:10,300
Stand down, Captain Rogers. Stand down.

636
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,927
Repeat, stand down.

637
00:50:49,464 --> 00:50:50,965
Eyes here.

638
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,259
Whatever your op is, bury it.

639
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:54,469
This is Level One.

640
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:56,721
Contact DOT.

641
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:58,473
All traffic lights in the district go red.

642
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:01,100
Shut all runways at BWI,

643
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:03,144
IAD and Reagan.

644
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:05,980
All security cameras in the city go through this monitor right here.

645
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,274
Scan all open sources,

646
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:10,193
phones, computers,

647
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:11,819
PDAs. Whatever.

648
00:51:12,654 --> 00:51:13,821
If someone tweets about this guy,

649
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,073
I want to know about it.

650
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:17,325
With all due respect, if S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting

651
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:20,286
a manhunt for Captain America we deserve to know why.

652
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,205
Because he lied to us.

653
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:27,335
Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury.

654
00:51:27,877 --> 00:51:29,462
He refused to share it.

655
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:32,632
As difficult as this is to accept,

656
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:37,011
Captain America is a fugitive from S.H.I.E.L.D.

657
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:05,623
- Where is it? - Safe.

658
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,417
- Do better. - Where did you get it?

659
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,876
Why would I tell you?

660
00:52:09,085 --> 00:52:11,129
Fury gave it to you. Why?

661
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:12,714
- What's on it? - I don't know.

662
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:13,923
Stop lying.

663
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:15,550
I only act like I know everything, Rogers.

664
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:18,553
I bet you knew Fury hired the pirates, didn't you?

665
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:22,974
Well, it makes sense. The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.

666
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:24,392
I'm not gonna ask you again.

667
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:27,478
I know who killed Fury.

668
00:52:31,441 --> 00:52:33,901
Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists.

669
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:36,946
The ones that do call him the Winter Soldier.

670
00:52:37,155 --> 00:52:39,157
He's credited with over two dozen assassinations

671
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,242
in the last 50 years.

672
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:43,244
So he's a ghost story.

673
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:46,664
Five years ago, I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran.

674
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:49,167
Somebody shot out my tyres near Odessa.

675
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:51,627
We lost control, went straight over a cliff.

676
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:53,129
I pulled us out.

677
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:55,214
But the Winter Soldier was there.

678
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:58,259
I was covering my engineer so he shot him

679
00:52:58,593 --> 00:52:59,594
straight through me.

680
00:53:00,428 --> 00:53:01,512
Soviet slug.

681
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:04,724
No rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis.

682
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:08,102
Yeah, I bet you look terrible in them now.

683
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:13,358
Going after him is a dead end. I know, I've tried.

684
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:16,778
Like you said, he's a ghost story.

685
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:23,534
Well, let's find out what the ghost wants.

686
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:25,870
Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood.

687
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:27,789
To any reasonable person,

688
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:30,500
that would make him a martyr, not a traitor.

689
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:31,959
You know what makes him a traitor?

690
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,462
Hiring a mercenary to hijack his own ship.

691
00:53:34,629 --> 00:53:36,964
Nick Fury used your friendship

692
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:40,176
to coerce this Council into delaying Project Insight.

693
00:53:40,385 --> 00:53:42,637
A project he knew would expose his own illegal operations.

694
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:45,890
At best, he lied to you. At worst...

695
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:48,393
Are you calling for my resignation?

696
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:49,977
I've got a pen and paper right here.

697
00:53:50,186 --> 00:53:52,730
That discussion can be tabled for a later time.

698
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,483
But you do want to have a discussion?

699
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,568
We've already had it, Mr Secretary.

700
00:53:58,653 --> 00:54:03,032
This Council moves to immediately reactivate Project Insight.

701
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:07,662
If you want to say something snappy, now would be a good time.

702
00:54:13,793 --> 00:54:17,088
First rule of going on the run is don't run, walk.

703
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,174
If I run in these shoes, they're gonna fall off.

704
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:25,638
The drive has a Level Six homing program, so as soon as we boot up

705
00:54:25,847 --> 00:54:27,723
S.H.I.E.L.D. will know exactly where we are.

706
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:28,850
How much time will we have?

707
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:31,519
About nine minutes from

708
00:54:33,146 --> 00:54:34,188
now.

709
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:41,154
Fury was right about that ship.

710
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:43,448
Somebody's trying to hide something.

711
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:45,616
This drive is protected by some sort of AI.

712
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:48,202
It keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands.

713
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:50,037
Can you override it?

714
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,748
The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me.

715
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:54,542
Slightly.

716
00:55:05,386 --> 00:55:06,596
I'm gonna try running a tracer.

717
00:55:07,722 --> 00:55:09,307
This is a program that S.H.I.E.L.D. developed

718
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:10,892
to track hostile malware,

719
00:55:11,058 --> 00:55:13,853
so if we can't read the file,

720
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:15,646
maybe we can find out where it came from.

721
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,231
Can I help you guys with anything?

722
00:55:18,024 --> 00:55:21,611
Oh, no. My fiancé was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations.

723
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,738
Right. We're getting married.

724
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,656
Congratulations. Where are you guys thinking about going?

725
00:55:27,742 --> 00:55:29,243
- New Jersey. - Oh.

726
00:55:34,207 --> 00:55:35,833
I have the exact same glasses.

727
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:38,419
Wow, you two are practically twins.

728
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,087
Yeah, I wish.

729
00:55:40,588 --> 00:55:41,589
Specimen.

730
00:55:42,298 --> 00:55:44,342
If you guys need anything, I've been Aaron.

731
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:45,426
Thank you.

732
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:50,264
- You said nine minutes. Come on. - Relax.

733
00:55:51,516 --> 00:55:52,600
Got it.

734
00:55:56,771 --> 00:55:57,855
You know it?

735
00:55:57,939 --> 00:55:59,482
I used to. Let's go.

736
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:02,860
Standard tac team.

737
00:56:03,069 --> 00:56:04,403
Two behind, two across,

738
00:56:04,612 --> 00:56:06,197
and two coming straight at us.

739
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:09,116
If they make us, I'll engage, you hit the south escalator to the metro.

740
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:11,244
Shut up and put your arm around me. Laugh at something I said.

741
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:12,662
- What? - Do it.

742
00:56:20,962 --> 00:56:21,963
Negative at the source.

743
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:23,130
Give me a floor rundown.

744
00:56:23,631 --> 00:56:24,799
Negative on three.

745
00:56:25,216 --> 00:56:26,217
Negative on two.

746
00:56:26,551 --> 00:56:28,803
Snake the upper levels. Work down to me.

747
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:37,812
- Kiss me. - What?

748
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,022
Public displays of affection make people very uncomfortable.

749
00:56:40,231 --> 00:56:41,357
Yes, they do.

750
00:56:50,825 --> 00:56:52,410
You still uncomfortable?

751
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:54,829
It's not exactly the word I would use.

752
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:06,090
Where did Captain America learn how to steal a car?

753
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:08,593
- Nazi Germany. - Mmm.

754
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:11,053
And we're borrowing. Take your feet off the dash.

755
00:57:15,308 --> 00:57:18,853
All right, I have a question for you, which you do not have to answer.

756
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:20,438
I feel like, if you don't answer it though,

757
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:21,856
- you're kind of answering it, you know. - What?

758
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,567
Was that your first kiss since 1945?

759
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:26,527
- That bad, huh? - I didn't say that.

760
00:57:26,694 --> 00:57:28,279
Well, it kind of sounds like that's what you're saying.

761
00:57:28,404 --> 00:57:29,488
No, I didn't.

762
00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:31,490
I just wondered how much practice you've had.

763
00:57:31,699 --> 00:57:33,326
- You don't need practice. - Everybody needs practice.

764
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:35,745
It was not my first kiss since 1945.

765
00:57:36,162 --> 00:57:37,872
I'm 95, I'm not dead.

766
00:57:38,456 --> 00:57:39,957
Nobody special, though?

767
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:43,294
Believe it or not, it's kind of hard

768
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:45,671
to find someone with shared life experience.

769
00:57:45,755 --> 00:57:47,340
Well, that's all right. You just make something up.

770
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,717
- What, like you? - I don't know.

771
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:51,052
The truth is a matter of circumstance.

772
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:53,554
It's not all things to all people, all the time.

773
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:55,890
Neither am I.

774
00:57:56,641 --> 00:57:57,892
That's a tough way to live.

775
00:57:59,101 --> 00:58:01,187
It's a good way not to die, though.

776
00:58:02,063 --> 00:58:03,522
You know, it's kind of hard to trust someone,

777
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:05,191
when you don't know who that someone really is.

778
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:07,360
Yeah.

779
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:11,656
Who do you want me to be?

780
00:58:12,615 --> 00:58:13,616
How about a friend?

781
00:58:17,078 --> 00:58:21,165
Well, there's a chance you might be in the wrong business, Rogers.

782
00:58:36,931 --> 00:58:38,307
This is it.

783
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:41,477
The file came from these coordinates.

784
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:43,979
So did I.

785
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:53,614
This camp is where I was trained.

786
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:57,785
Change much?

787
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:01,664
A little.

788
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,999
Pick up the pace, ladies!

789
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:05,793
Let's go! Let's go!

790
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:07,878
Double time!

791
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:11,173
Come on, Rogers, move it!

792
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:16,512
Come on, fall in!

793
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:18,639
Rogers!

794
00:59:19,098 --> 00:59:20,307
I said fall in!

795
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:23,811
This is a dead end.

796
00:59:23,978 --> 00:59:26,772
Zero heat signatures, zero waves, not even radio.

797
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:31,026
Whoever wrote the file must have used a router to throw people off.

798
00:59:32,987 --> 00:59:33,988
What is it?

799
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:35,990
Army regulations forbid storing munitions

800
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:38,117
within 500 yards of the barracks.

801
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:40,953
This building is in the wrong place.

802
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,179
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.

803
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:00,973
Maybe where it started.

804
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:20,743
And there's Stark's father.

805
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:22,703
Howard.

806
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:25,289
Who's the girl?

807
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:47,019
If you're already working in a secret office,

808
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:59,156
why do you need to hide the elevator?

809
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:54,628
This can't be the data point. This technology is ancient.

810
01:02:24,617 --> 01:02:26,619
Y-E-S spells yes.

811
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,583
Shall we play a game?

812
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:35,586
- It's from a movie that was really... - I know, I saw it.

813
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:43,802
Rogers, Steven,

814
01:02:44,845 --> 01:02:46,513
born 1918.

815
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:52,394
Romanoff Natalia Alianovna,

816
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:54,438
born 1984.

817
01:02:54,647 --> 01:02:55,981
It's some kind of recording.

818
01:02:56,190 --> 01:02:58,525
I am not a recording, Fräulein.

819
01:02:59,193 --> 01:03:00,903
I may not be the man I was

820
01:03:01,195 --> 01:03:04,365
when the Captain took me prisoner in 1945.

821
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:06,492
But I am.

822
01:03:08,327 --> 01:03:09,745
You know this thing?

823
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:16,168
Arnim Zola was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull.

824
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:17,586
He's been dead for years.

825
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:20,089
First correction, I am Swiss.

826
01:03:20,506 --> 01:03:22,883
Second, look around you.

827
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:25,678
I have never been more alive.

828
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:30,516
In 1972, I received a terminal diagnosis.

829
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:33,477
Science could not save my body.

830
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:37,898
My mind, however, that was worth saving,

831
01:03:38,107 --> 01:03:41,860
on 200,000 feet of data banks.

832
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:45,656
You are standing in my brain.

833
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:48,075
- How did you get here? - invited.

834
01:03:48,701 --> 01:03:50,911
It was Operation Paperclip after World War ll.

835
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,748
S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited German scientists with strategic value.

836
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:57,084
They thought I could help their cause.

837
01:03:57,251 --> 01:03:59,128
I also helped my own.

838
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:00,838
HYDRA died with the Red Skull.

839
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:04,925
Cut off one head, two more shall take its place.

840
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:06,760
Prove it.

841
01:04:08,137 --> 01:04:10,055
Accessing archive.

842
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:13,934
HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity

843
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:17,271
could not be trusted with its own freedom.

844
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:20,149
What we did not realise was that if you try

845
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:23,152
to take that freedom, they resist.

846
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:25,571
The war taught us much.

847
01:04:26,155 --> 01:04:29,450
Humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly.

848
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:33,328
After the war, S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded,

849
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:35,622
and I was recruited.

850
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:38,083
The new HYDRA grew.

851
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:42,546
A beautiful parasite inside S.H.I.E.L.D.

852
01:04:42,963 --> 01:04:44,631
For 70 years,

853
01:04:44,798 --> 01:04:50,429
HYDRA has been secretly feeding crisis, reaping war,

854
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:53,307
and when history did not cooperate,

855
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:55,809
history was changed.

856
01:04:56,143 --> 01:04:58,312
That's impossible. S.H.I.E.L.D. would have stopped you.

857
01:04:58,437 --> 01:05:00,856
Accidents will happen.

858
01:05:02,858 --> 01:05:05,652
HYDRA created a world so chaotic

859
01:05:05,861 --> 01:05:09,698
that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom

860
01:05:10,032 --> 01:05:12,034
to gain its security.

861
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:16,080
Once a purification process is complete,

862
01:05:16,622 --> 01:05:20,000
HYDRA's new world order will arise.

863
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:22,836
We won, Captain.

864
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:26,507
Your death amounts to the same as your life.

865
01:05:27,007 --> 01:05:28,050
A zero sum.

866
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:33,555
As I was saying...

867
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:35,432
What's on this drive?

868
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:38,936
Project Insight requires insight.

869
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:41,939
So, I wrote an algorithm.

870
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:43,607
What kind of algorithm? What does it do?

871
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:46,193
The answer to your question is fascinating.

872
01:05:46,652 --> 01:05:50,697
Unfortunately, you shall be too dead to hear it.

873
01:05:56,537 --> 01:05:57,955
Steve, we got a bogey.

874
01:05:58,413 --> 01:05:59,957
Short range ballistic.

875
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,959
- 30 seconds tops. - Who fired it?

876
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:03,043
S.H.I.E.L.D.

877
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:06,964
I am afraid I have been stalling, Captain.

878
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,549
Admit it.

879
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:10,968
It's better this way.

880
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:12,553
We are, both of us,

881
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,139
out of time.

882
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:40,098
Call in the asset.

883
01:07:56,323 --> 01:07:57,699
I'm going to go, Mr Pierce.

884
01:07:58,242 --> 01:08:00,035
You need anything before I leave?

885
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:04,122
No... Uh, it's fine, Renata, you can go home.

886
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:06,458
Okay. Night-night.

887
01:08:06,667 --> 01:08:08,335
Good night.

888
01:08:13,465 --> 01:08:14,841
Want some milk?

889
01:08:24,476 --> 01:08:26,311
The timetable has moved.

890
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,190
Our window is limited.

891
01:08:34,236 --> 01:08:36,363
Two targets, Level Six.

892
01:08:37,823 --> 01:08:40,033
They already cost me Zola.

893
01:08:40,242 --> 01:08:42,452
I want confirmed death in 10 hours.

894
01:08:44,413 --> 01:08:46,540
Sorry, Mr Pierce, I...

895
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,333
I forgot my

896
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:49,668
phone.

897
01:08:54,715 --> 01:08:57,843
Oh, Renata, I wish you would have knocked.

898
01:09:22,409 --> 01:09:23,493
Hey, man.

899
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:27,080
I'm sorry about this. We need a place to lay low.

900
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:28,915
Everyone we know is trying to kill us.

901
01:09:31,877 --> 01:09:33,378
Not everyone.

902
01:09:50,354 --> 01:09:52,022
- You okay? - Yeah.

903
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,449
What's going on?

904
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:09,122
When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D. I thought I was going straight.

905
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:15,879
But I guess I just traded in the KGB for HYDRA.

906
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,845
I thought I knew whose lies I was telling,

907
01:10:27,641 --> 01:10:30,394
but I guess I can't tell the difference any more.

908
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,355
There's a chance you might be in the wrong business.

909
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:39,736
I owe you.

910
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:42,322
It's okay.

911
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:45,075
If it was the other way around,

912
01:10:46,326 --> 01:10:47,786
and it was down to me to save your life,

913
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:49,496
now you be honest with me,

914
01:10:51,665 --> 01:10:53,542
would you trust me to do it?

915
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:56,711
I would now.

916
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:01,508
And I'm always honest.

917
01:11:02,843 --> 01:11:03,969
Well, you seem pretty chipper

918
01:11:04,177 --> 01:11:05,846
for someone who just found out they died for nothing.

919
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:10,434
Well, guess I just like to know who I'm fighting.

920
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:12,310
I made breakfast.

921
01:11:12,978 --> 01:11:15,897
If you guys eat that sort of thing.

922
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:18,859
So, the question is,

923
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,027
who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch a domestic missile strike?

924
01:11:23,113 --> 01:11:24,114
Pierce.

925
01:11:24,406 --> 01:11:27,033
Who happens to be sitting on top of the most secure building in the world.

926
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,368
But he's not working alone.

927
01:11:28,577 --> 01:11:30,871
Zola's algorithm was on the Lemurian Star.

928
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:33,540
So was Jasper Sitwell.

929
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:39,504
So, the real question is, how do the two most wanted people

930
01:11:39,713 --> 01:11:42,632
in Washington kidnap a S.H.I.E.L.D. officer in broad daylight?

931
01:11:43,467 --> 01:11:45,343
The answer is, you don't.

932
01:11:46,303 --> 01:11:48,054
- What's this? - Call it a résumé.

933
01:11:51,725 --> 01:11:53,268
Is this Bakhmala?

934
01:11:53,477 --> 01:11:54,895
The Khalid Khandil mission, that was you?

935
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,023
You didn't say he was a Pararescue.

936
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:01,902
- Is this Riley? - Yeah.

937
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:04,362
I heard they couldn't bring in the choppers because of the RPGs.

938
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:05,780
What did you use? A stealth chute?

939
01:12:05,864 --> 01:12:06,907
No.

940
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,075
These.

941
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:15,290
I thought you said you were a pilot.

942
01:12:15,582 --> 01:12:16,917
I never said pilot.

943
01:12:20,921 --> 01:12:22,672
I can't ask you to do this, Sam.

944
01:12:23,298 --> 01:12:24,716
You got out for a good reason.

945
01:12:24,925 --> 01:12:26,426
Dude, Captain America needs my help.

946
01:12:26,635 --> 01:12:28,178
There's no better reason to get back in.

947
01:12:31,932 --> 01:12:33,600
Where can we get our hands on one of these things?

948
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:34,935
The last one is at Fort Meade.

949
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:38,480
Behind three guarded gates and a 12-inch steel wall.

950
01:12:41,525 --> 01:12:42,651
Shouldn't be a problem.

951
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:45,946
Listen, I got to fly home tonight

952
01:12:46,154 --> 01:12:48,949
because I got some constituency problem

953
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:51,034
and I got to press the flesh.

954
01:12:51,243 --> 01:12:53,537
Any constituent in particular, Mr Senator?

955
01:12:54,079 --> 01:12:55,497
Oh, no, not really.

956
01:12:56,456 --> 01:12:58,333
Twenty-three, kind of hot.

957
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,126
Real hot, you know?

958
01:13:00,335 --> 01:13:02,462
Wants to be a reporter, I think. I don't know.

959
01:13:02,671 --> 01:13:03,672
Who listens at that point?

960
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,507
Doesn't sound like much of a problem to me.

961
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,801
Really? Because she's killing my back.

962
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,512
But this isn't the place to talk about it.

963
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,763
This is a nice pin.

964
01:13:13,056 --> 01:13:15,141
- Thank you. - Come here.

965
01:13:15,976 --> 01:13:17,310
Hail HYDRA.

966
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,315
- See, it's right there... - Yeah, I just saw that.

967
01:13:23,233 --> 01:13:24,776
- Should I get it checked? - I think you should.

968
01:13:33,535 --> 01:13:34,661
I need a minute.

969
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:36,538
Bring the car around.

970
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,334
Yes, sir?

971
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:43,086
Agent Sitwell, how was lunch?

972
01:13:43,295 --> 01:13:45,880
I hear the crab cakes here are delicious.

973
01:13:46,006 --> 01:13:47,048
Who is this?

974
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:49,884
The good-looking guy in the sunglasses, your 10 o' clock.

975
01:13:52,012 --> 01:13:53,138
Your other 10 o' clock.

976
01:13:55,015 --> 01:13:56,016
There you go.

977
01:13:58,852 --> 01:14:00,353
What do you want?

978
01:14:00,562 --> 01:14:02,355
You're gonna go around the corner to your right.

979
01:14:02,564 --> 01:14:05,066
There's a grey car two spaces down.

980
01:14:05,275 --> 01:14:07,110
You and I are gonna take a ride.

981
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:09,029
And why would I do that?

982
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,781
Because that tie looks really expensive,

983
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,200
and I'd hate to mess it up.

984
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,045
Tell me about Zola's algorithm.

985
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:27,130
Never heard of it.

986
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,256
What were you doing on the Lemurian Star?

987
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:30,050
I was throwing up. I get seasick.

988
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:38,433
Is this little display meant to insinuate that you're gonna throw me off the roof?

989
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:40,977
Because it's really not your style, Rogers.

990
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:43,229
You're right.

991
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:45,148
It's not.

992
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:46,691
It's hers.

993
01:14:50,612 --> 01:14:53,198
Oh, wait. What about that girl from Accounting, Laura...

994
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,575
Lillian. Lip piercing, right?

995
01:14:55,659 --> 01:14:56,826
Yeah, she's cute.

996
01:14:56,910 --> 01:14:58,411
Yeah. I'm not ready for that.

997
01:15:10,298 --> 01:15:12,342
Zola's algorithm is a program

998
01:15:14,052 --> 01:15:15,136
for choosing

999
01:15:15,345 --> 01:15:16,888
- Insight's targets. - What targets?

1000
01:15:17,263 --> 01:15:18,348
You!

1001
01:15:19,349 --> 01:15:21,726
A TV anchor in Cairo, the Under Secretary of Defence,

1002
01:15:21,935 --> 01:15:24,354
a high school valedictorian in Iowa City,

1003
01:15:24,604 --> 01:15:26,523
Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange, anyone who's a threat

1004
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,525
to HYDRA.

1005
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:30,443
Now, or in the future.

1006
01:15:30,777 --> 01:15:32,529
In the future? How could it know?

1007
01:15:36,116 --> 01:15:37,158
How could it not?

1008
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:42,622
The 21st century is a digital book.

1009
01:15:43,957 --> 01:15:45,792
Zola taught HYDRA how to read it.

1010
01:15:48,712 --> 01:15:49,838
Your bank records,

1011
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:51,673
medical histories, voting patterns,

1012
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:54,300
emails, phone calls, your damn SAT scores!

1013
01:15:55,844 --> 01:15:59,180
Zola's algorithm evaluates people's past

1014
01:16:00,098 --> 01:16:01,307
to predict their future.

1015
01:16:01,641 --> 01:16:02,684
And what then?

1016
01:16:06,104 --> 01:16:07,897
Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.

1017
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:09,524
What then?

1018
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:15,196
Then the Insight helicarriers scratch people off the list.

1019
01:16:17,449 --> 01:16:19,284
A few million at a time.

1020
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,001
HYDRA doesn't like leaks.

1021
01:16:28,168 --> 01:16:29,836
Then why don't you try sticking a cork in it?

1022
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:31,337
Insight's launching in 16 hours.

1023
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:32,547
We're cutting it a little bit close here.

1024
01:16:32,756 --> 01:16:34,674
I know. We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans

1025
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:36,259
and access the helicarriers directly.

1026
01:16:36,468 --> 01:16:37,510
What? Are you crazy?

1027
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:40,138
That is a terrible, terrible idea.

1028
01:17:23,807 --> 01:17:25,016
Shit!

1029
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:37,779
Hang on!

1030
01:19:18,171 --> 01:19:21,132
I have her. Find him.

1031
01:20:26,406 --> 01:20:27,407
Go! I got this!

1032
01:21:07,447 --> 01:21:09,115
Taking fire above and below expressway.

1033
01:21:09,282 --> 01:21:11,743
Civilians threatened. Repeat, civilians threatened.

1034
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:18,624
I make an LZ, 2300 block of Virginia Avenue.

1035
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:19,876
Rendezvous, two minutes.

1036
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:46,319
Get out of the way!

1037
01:21:46,861 --> 01:21:48,488
Stay out of the way!

1038
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:51,407
Ahh!

1039
01:23:35,553 --> 01:23:36,596
Bucky?

1040
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:38,598
Who the hell is Bucky?

1041
01:24:07,293 --> 01:24:08,794
Drop the shield, Cap! Get on your knees!

1042
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:10,421
Get on your knees!

1043
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:13,216
Get down, get down! Get on your knees!

1044
01:24:13,299 --> 01:24:14,425
Down!

1045
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:15,968
Don't move.

1046
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:24,227
Put the gun down.

1047
01:24:24,435 --> 01:24:26,354
Not here. Not here!

1048
01:24:41,869 --> 01:24:42,912
It was him.

1049
01:24:46,165 --> 01:24:49,669
He looked right at me like he didn't even know me.

1050
01:24:50,211 --> 01:24:52,922
How is that even possible? It was, like, 70 years ago.

1051
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:54,340
Zola.

1052
01:24:54,507 --> 01:24:56,133
Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43.

1053
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:58,177
Zola experimented on him.

1054
01:24:58,386 --> 01:25:00,680
Whatever he did helped Bucky survive the fall.

1055
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:03,683
They must have found him and...

1056
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:05,685
None of that's your fault, Steve.

1057
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:11,023
Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.

1058
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:16,070
We need to get a doctor here.

1059
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:17,280
If we don't put pressure on that wound,

1060
01:25:17,488 --> 01:25:18,781
she's gonna bleed out here in the truck.

1061
01:25:26,372 --> 01:25:29,500
Ah. That thing was squeezing my brain.

1062
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:33,671
Who is this guy?

1063
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:46,434
Three holes. Start digging.

1064
01:26:13,586 --> 01:26:15,504
GSW. She's lost at least a pint.

1065
01:26:15,713 --> 01:26:16,922
Maybe two.

1066
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:19,091
- Let me take her. - She'll want to see him first.

1067
01:26:29,018 --> 01:26:31,228
About damn time.

1068
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:34,815
Lacerated spinal column,

1069
01:26:35,441 --> 01:26:36,776
cracked sternum,

1070
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:38,444
shattered collarbone,

1071
01:26:38,611 --> 01:26:40,279
perforated liver,

1072
01:26:40,446 --> 01:26:42,198
and one hell of a headache.

1073
01:26:42,448 --> 01:26:43,783
Don't forget your collapsed lung.

1074
01:26:43,991 --> 01:26:45,284
Let's not forget that.

1075
01:26:45,493 --> 01:26:47,119
Otherwise, I'm good.

1076
01:26:47,495 --> 01:26:49,622
They cut you open. Your heart stopped.

1077
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:51,874
Tetrodotoxin B.

1078
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:54,043
Slows the pulse to one beat a minute.

1079
01:26:54,251 --> 01:26:56,045
Banner developed it for stress.

1080
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:58,839
Didn't work so great for him, but we found a use for it.

1081
01:26:59,048 --> 01:27:00,925
Why all the secrecy? Why not just tell us?

1082
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:03,386
Any attempt on the Director's life had to look successful.

1083
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:06,097
Can't kill you if you're already dead.

1084
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:07,515
Besides,

1085
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:10,309
I wasn't sure who to trust.

1086
01:27:25,825 --> 01:27:27,159
Sergeant Barnes.

1087
01:27:29,328 --> 01:27:30,329
Bucky, no!

1088
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:37,128
The procedure has already started.

1089
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:44,677
You are to be the new fist of HYDRA.

1090
01:27:45,094 --> 01:27:46,095
Put him on ice.

1091
01:27:57,481 --> 01:27:58,482
Sir.

1092
01:27:59,191 --> 01:28:00,693
He's unstable.

1093
01:28:01,193 --> 01:28:02,611
Erratic.

1094
01:28:15,875 --> 01:28:16,959
Mission report.

1095
01:28:20,463 --> 01:28:21,797
Mission report now.

1096
01:28:34,602 --> 01:28:36,020
The man on the bridge.

1097
01:28:39,148 --> 01:28:40,399
Who was he?

1098
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:44,069
You met him earlier this week on another assignment.

1099
01:28:47,156 --> 01:28:48,491
I knew him.

1100
01:28:57,082 --> 01:28:59,752
Your work has been a gift to mankind.

1101
01:29:02,046 --> 01:29:03,422
You shaped the century.

1102
01:29:04,131 --> 01:29:06,592
And I need you to do it one more time.

1103
01:29:07,885 --> 01:29:11,555
Society's at a tipping point between order and chaos.

1104
01:29:11,764 --> 01:29:14,433
And tomorrow morning, we're gonna give it a push.

1105
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:18,771
But, if you don't do your part, I can't do mine.

1106
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:23,275
And HYDRA can't give the world the freedom it deserves.

1107
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:27,905
But I knew him.

1108
01:29:34,453 --> 01:29:35,955
Prep him.

1109
01:29:36,163 --> 01:29:38,749
He's been out of cryo freeze too long.

1110
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:40,960
Then wipe him and start over.

1111
01:30:22,668 --> 01:30:26,255
This man declined the Nobel Peace Prize.

1112
01:30:27,006 --> 01:30:30,259
He said peace wasn't an achievement,

1113
01:30:30,718 --> 01:30:32,803
it was a responsibility.

1114
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:37,057
See, it's stuff like this that gives me trust issues.

1115
01:30:37,808 --> 01:30:39,059
We have to stop the launch.

1116
01:30:40,019 --> 01:30:42,771
I don't think the Council's accepting my calls any more.

1117
01:30:45,274 --> 01:30:46,358
What's that?

1118
01:30:46,734 --> 01:30:49,403
Once the helicarriers reach 3,000 feet,

1119
01:30:49,486 --> 01:30:52,823
they'll triangulate with Insight satellites, becoming fully weaponised.

1120
01:30:53,532 --> 01:30:55,200
We need to breach those carriers

1121
01:30:55,409 --> 01:30:57,953
and replace their targeting blades with our own.

1122
01:30:58,037 --> 01:30:59,038
One or two won't cut it.

1123
01:30:59,246 --> 01:31:01,749
We need to link all three carriers for this to work,

1124
01:31:01,957 --> 01:31:05,294
because if even one of those ships remains operational,

1125
01:31:05,502 --> 01:31:07,296
a whole lot of people are gonna die.

1126
01:31:07,504 --> 01:31:10,674
We have to assume everyone aboard those carriers is HYDRA.

1127
01:31:11,008 --> 01:31:13,093
We have to get past them, insert these server blades.

1128
01:31:13,302 --> 01:31:16,388
And maybe, just maybe we can salvage what's left...

1129
01:31:16,597 --> 01:31:17,598
We're not salvaging anything.

1130
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:19,058
We're not just taking down the carriers, Nick.

1131
01:31:19,266 --> 01:31:20,309
We're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.

1132
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:21,685
S.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing to do with this.

1133
01:31:21,894 --> 01:31:24,063
You gave me this mission. This is how it ends.

1134
01:31:24,188 --> 01:31:26,231
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been compromised. You said so yourself.

1135
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:28,233
HYDRA grew right under your nose and nobody noticed.

1136
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,570
Why do you think we're meeting in this cave? I noticed.

1137
01:31:31,904 --> 01:31:33,614
How many paid the price before you did?

1138
01:31:36,659 --> 01:31:38,410
Look, I didn't know about Barnes.

1139
01:31:38,619 --> 01:31:39,995
Even if you had, would you have told me?

1140
01:31:40,704 --> 01:31:43,415
Or would you have compartmentalised that, too?

1141
01:31:43,624 --> 01:31:46,418
S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA,

1142
01:31:46,627 --> 01:31:47,920
it all goes.

1143
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,630
He's right.

1144
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:56,470
Don't look at me.

1145
01:31:56,679 --> 01:31:58,555
I do what he does, just slower.

1146
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:03,936
Well...

1147
01:32:10,192 --> 01:32:12,611
It looks like you're giving the orders now, Captain.

1148
01:32:24,248 --> 01:32:25,708
We looked for you, after.

1149
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,002
My folks wanted to give you a ride to the cemetery.

1150
01:32:29,211 --> 01:32:32,798
I know, I'm sorry. I just kind of wanted to be alone.

1151
01:32:33,924 --> 01:32:35,300
How was it?

1152
01:32:35,801 --> 01:32:37,261
It was okay.

1153
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:39,638
She's next to Dad.

1154
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:42,391
I was gonna ask...

1155
01:32:42,808 --> 01:32:44,268
I know what you're gonna say, Buck. I just...

1156
01:32:45,436 --> 01:32:46,937
We can put the couch cushions on the floor

1157
01:32:47,146 --> 01:32:48,647
like when we were kids.

1158
01:32:49,314 --> 01:32:51,817
It'll be fun. All you got to do is shine my shoes,

1159
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:53,902
maybe take out the trash.

1160
01:32:58,949 --> 01:33:00,367
Come on.

1161
01:33:03,412 --> 01:33:06,832
Thank you, Buck, but I can get by on my own.

1162
01:33:07,624 --> 01:33:11,420
The thing is, you don't have to.

1163
01:33:14,757 --> 01:33:16,341
I'm with you to the end of the line, pal.

1164
01:33:19,678 --> 01:33:21,013
He's gonna be there, you know.

1165
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:22,139
I know.

1166
01:33:23,015 --> 01:33:26,351
Look, whoever he used to be and the guy he is now,

1167
01:33:27,019 --> 01:33:29,188
I don't think he's the kind you save.

1168
01:33:29,396 --> 01:33:30,856
He's the kind you stop.

1169
01:33:33,525 --> 01:33:35,110
I don't know if I can do that.

1170
01:33:35,444 --> 01:33:37,404
Well, he might not give you a choice.

1171
01:33:37,613 --> 01:33:39,072
He doesn't know you.

1172
01:33:39,782 --> 01:33:40,824
He will.

1173
01:33:43,619 --> 01:33:44,870
Gear up. It's time.

1174
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:48,624
You gonna wear that?

1175
01:33:48,874 --> 01:33:52,252
No. If you're gonna fight a war, you got to wear a uniform.

1176
01:34:00,177 --> 01:34:01,595
Oh, man.

1177
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:04,473
I am so fired.

1178
01:34:29,373 --> 01:34:31,583
We are in final launch sequence.

1179
01:34:33,252 --> 01:34:35,170
We are go on guidance.

1180
01:34:37,089 --> 01:34:39,216
All personnel to launch stations.

1181
01:34:39,967 --> 01:34:41,134
And how was your flight?

1182
01:34:41,343 --> 01:34:42,386
Lovely.

1183
01:34:42,469 --> 01:34:44,972
The ride from the airport, less so.

1184
01:34:45,097 --> 01:34:47,599
Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D. can't control everything.

1185
01:34:47,766 --> 01:34:49,685
Including Captain America.

1186
01:34:53,105 --> 01:34:55,691
This facility is biometrically controlled.

1187
01:34:55,899 --> 01:34:58,777
And these will give you unrestricted access.

1188
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:03,907
I've been parking there for two months.

1189
01:35:04,116 --> 01:35:05,701
- But it's his spot. - So where's he been?

1190
01:35:05,909 --> 01:35:07,160
I think Afghanistan.

1191
01:35:07,244 --> 01:35:09,246
Negative DT Six. The pattern is full.

1192
01:35:09,454 --> 01:35:10,747
Well, he could've said something.

1193
01:35:10,831 --> 01:35:12,332
Ahh!

1194
01:35:12,416 --> 01:35:13,709
Must be the dish.

1195
01:35:15,502 --> 01:35:17,129
I'll check it out.

1196
01:35:17,963 --> 01:35:20,966
Triskelion command request we clear the area for launch.

1197
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:25,596
Excuse us.

1198
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:28,140
I know the road hasn't exactly been smooth,

1199
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:31,977
and some of you would have gladly kicked me out of the car along the way.

1200
01:35:34,229 --> 01:35:35,188
Finally, we're here.

1201
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:37,858
And the world should be grateful.

1202
01:35:38,817 --> 01:35:40,527
Attention all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents,

1203
01:35:40,736 --> 01:35:42,487
this is Steve Rogers.

1204
01:35:44,281 --> 01:35:46,491
You've heard a lot about me over the last few days.

1205
01:35:47,534 --> 01:35:49,786
Some of you were even ordered to hunt me down.

1206
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:53,373
But I think it's time you know the truth.

1207
01:35:56,501 --> 01:35:58,670
S.H.I.E.L.D. is not what we thought it was.

1208
01:35:58,879 --> 01:36:00,589
It's been taken over by HYDRA.

1209
01:36:01,715 --> 01:36:03,383
Alexander Pierce is their leader.

1210
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:09,848
The S.T.R.I.K.E. and Insight crew are HYDRA as well.

1211
01:36:10,057 --> 01:36:11,099
I don't know how many more,

1212
01:36:12,392 --> 01:36:13,393
but I know they're in the building.

1213
01:36:15,187 --> 01:36:17,064
They could be standing right next to you.

1214
01:36:18,649 --> 01:36:20,317
They almost have what they want.

1215
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:23,195
Absolute control.

1216
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,030
They shot Nick Fury.

1217
01:36:26,156 --> 01:36:27,282
And it won't end there.

1218
01:36:27,824 --> 01:36:30,035
If you launch those helicarriers today,

1219
01:36:30,202 --> 01:36:32,204
HYDRA will be able to kill anyone that stands in their way.

1220
01:36:35,499 --> 01:36:36,875
Unless we stop them.

1221
01:36:40,879 --> 01:36:42,005
I know I'm asking a lot.

1222
01:36:43,924 --> 01:36:47,094
But the price of freedom is high. It always has been.

1223
01:36:47,844 --> 01:36:49,721
And it's a price I'm willing to pay.

1224
01:36:52,099 --> 01:36:54,893
And if I'm the only one, then so be it.

1225
01:36:56,561 --> 01:36:58,313
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.

1226
01:37:03,068 --> 01:37:06,363
Did you write that down first, or was it off the top of your head?

1227
01:37:06,863 --> 01:37:08,490
You smug son of a bitch.

1228
01:37:12,577 --> 01:37:13,620
Arrest him.

1229
01:37:16,498 --> 01:37:18,125
I guess I've got the floor.

1230
01:37:25,007 --> 01:37:27,926
Preempt the launch sequence. Send those ships up now.

1231
01:37:32,305 --> 01:37:33,807
Is there a problem?

1232
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:34,891
Um...

1233
01:37:38,854 --> 01:37:39,938
Is there a problem?

1234
01:37:40,105 --> 01:37:41,189
I'm sorry, sir.

1235
01:37:49,906 --> 01:37:52,117
I'm not gonna launch those ships.

1236
01:37:54,828 --> 01:37:56,121
Captain's orders.

1237
01:37:56,329 --> 01:37:57,581
Move away from your station.

1238
01:37:57,956 --> 01:37:58,999
Like he said...

1239
01:37:59,166 --> 01:38:00,208
Hold it right there.

1240
01:38:00,292 --> 01:38:01,626
Put the gun down!

1241
01:38:01,793 --> 01:38:02,794
Captain's orders.

1242
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:06,631
You picked the wrong side, Agent.

1243
01:38:08,467 --> 01:38:10,093
Depends on where you're standing.

1244
01:38:54,471 --> 01:38:55,931
Close the bay door!

1245
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:57,349
Close the bay door now!

1246
01:38:57,849 --> 01:38:58,809
Close the bay door!

1247
01:39:18,662 --> 01:39:19,871
They're initiating launch.

1248
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:42,686
Hey, Cap, how do we know the good guys from the bad guys?

1249
01:39:42,894 --> 01:39:44,354
If they're shooting at you, they're bad.

1250
01:40:17,721 --> 01:40:18,722
Hey, Cap,

1251
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:20,932
I found those bad guys you were talking about.

1252
01:40:21,016 --> 01:40:22,017
You okay?

1253
01:40:24,144 --> 01:40:25,687
I'm not dead yet.

1254
01:40:32,652 --> 01:40:34,404
Let me ask you a question.

1255
01:40:36,907 --> 01:40:40,035
What if Pakistan marched into Mumbai tomorrow

1256
01:40:41,328 --> 01:40:43,455
and you knew that they were going to drag your daughters

1257
01:40:43,663 --> 01:40:46,458
into a soccer stadium for execution,

1258
01:40:48,877 --> 01:40:52,214
and you could just stop it, with a flick of the switch.

1259
01:40:52,422 --> 01:40:53,590
Wouldn't you?

1260
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:55,425
Wouldn't you all?

1261
01:40:57,302 --> 01:40:58,803
Not if it was your switch.

1262
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,537
I'm sorry.

1263
01:41:30,961 --> 01:41:32,504
Did I step on your moment?

1264
01:41:34,089 --> 01:41:36,341
Satellites in range at 3,000 feet.

1265
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:38,468
Falcon, status?

1266
01:41:38,718 --> 01:41:39,886
Engaging.

1267
01:42:03,994 --> 01:42:05,287
All right, Cap. I'm in.

1268
01:42:07,664 --> 01:42:08,707
Oh, shit.

1269
01:42:39,237 --> 01:42:40,697
Eight minutes, Cap.

1270
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:42,574
Working on it.

1271
01:42:50,915 --> 01:42:51,958
What are you doing?

1272
01:42:52,042 --> 01:42:53,626
She's disabling security protocols

1273
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:55,462
and dumping all the secrets onto the Internet.

1274
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:57,255
- Including HYDRA's. - And S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

1275
01:42:58,590 --> 01:42:59,674
If you do this,

1276
01:42:59,924 --> 01:43:01,593
none of your past is gonna remain hidden.

1277
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:07,182
Are you sure you're ready for the world to see you

1278
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:08,933
as you really are?

1279
01:43:09,684 --> 01:43:11,102
Are you?

1280
01:43:27,369 --> 01:43:28,411
Alpha lock.

1281
01:43:30,538 --> 01:43:31,831
Falcon, where are you now?

1282
01:43:31,998 --> 01:43:32,916
I had to take a detour.

1283
01:44:03,822 --> 01:44:04,823
Whoo!

1284
01:44:05,532 --> 01:44:07,117
Oh, yeah!

1285
01:44:13,123 --> 01:44:14,165
I'm in.

1286
01:44:17,794 --> 01:44:19,629
Bravo lock.

1287
01:44:21,423 --> 01:44:22,715
Two down, one to go.

1288
01:44:25,009 --> 01:44:26,511
All S.H.I.E.L.D. pilots, scramble.

1289
01:44:27,387 --> 01:44:30,014
We're the only air support Captain Rogers has got.

1290
01:45:12,474 --> 01:45:15,143
Disabling the encryption is an executive order.

1291
01:45:15,351 --> 01:45:17,020
It takes two Alpha Level members.

1292
01:45:17,228 --> 01:45:19,189
Don't worry. Company's coming.

1293
01:45:42,795 --> 01:45:43,922
Did you get my flowers?

1294
01:45:46,633 --> 01:45:48,301
- I'm glad you're here, Nick. - Really?

1295
01:45:50,261 --> 01:45:52,138
Because I thought you had me killed.

1296
01:45:52,347 --> 01:45:53,806
You know how the game works.

1297
01:45:54,891 --> 01:45:56,601
So why make me head of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

1298
01:45:56,684 --> 01:45:57,977
Because you were the best,

1299
01:45:58,144 --> 01:45:59,604
and the most ruthless person I ever met.

1300
01:45:59,938 --> 01:46:02,148
I did what I did to protect people.

1301
01:46:03,066 --> 01:46:05,026
Our enemies are your enemies, Nick.

1302
01:46:05,944 --> 01:46:08,279
Disorder. War.

1303
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,616
It's just a matter of time before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow,

1304
01:46:11,783 --> 01:46:13,952
or an EMP fries Chicago.

1305
01:46:15,537 --> 01:46:16,955
Diplomacy?

1306
01:46:17,121 --> 01:46:19,457
A holding action, Nick. A band-aid.

1307
01:46:20,375 --> 01:46:23,294
And you know where I learned that. Bogota.

1308
01:46:25,046 --> 01:46:27,757
You didn't ask. You just did what had to be done.

1309
01:46:28,967 --> 01:46:33,263
I can bring order to the lives of seven billion people

1310
01:46:33,972 --> 01:46:35,598
by sacrificing 20 million.

1311
01:46:37,141 --> 01:46:39,102
It's the next step, Nick.

1312
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:40,436
If you have the courage to take it.

1313
01:46:40,645 --> 01:46:42,730
No. I have the courage not to.

1314
01:46:47,235 --> 01:46:49,112
Retinal scanner active.

1315
01:46:50,613 --> 01:46:52,991
You don't think we've wiped your clearance from the system?

1316
01:46:53,157 --> 01:46:55,118
I know you erased my password.

1317
01:46:55,326 --> 01:46:57,245
Probably deleted my retinal scan.

1318
01:46:57,787 --> 01:47:00,623
But if you want to stay ahead of me, Mr Secretary,

1319
01:47:04,627 --> 01:47:07,589
you need to keep both eyes open.

1320
01:47:12,010 --> 01:47:13,511
Alpha level confirmed.

1321
01:47:14,012 --> 01:47:15,847
Encryption code accepted.

1322
01:47:16,014 --> 01:47:17,181
Safeguards removed.

1323
01:47:17,557 --> 01:47:20,560
Charlie carrier is 45 degrees off the port bow.

1324
01:47:26,274 --> 01:47:27,358
Six minutes.

1325
01:47:27,525 --> 01:47:29,986
Hey, Sam, gonna need a ride.

1326
01:47:30,862 --> 01:47:32,530
Roger. Let me know when you're ready.

1327
01:47:35,158 --> 01:47:36,367
I just did!

1328
01:47:54,135 --> 01:47:56,054
You know, you're a lot heavier than you look.

1329
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:57,347
I had a big breakfast.

1330
01:47:59,974 --> 01:48:01,267
Steve!

1331
01:48:31,756 --> 01:48:33,132
Cap! Cap, come in. Are you okay?

1332
01:48:33,716 --> 01:48:35,009
Yeah, I'm here.

1333
01:48:35,551 --> 01:48:36,594
I'm still on the helicarrier.

1334
01:48:37,637 --> 01:48:39,263
- Where are you? - I'm grounded.

1335
01:48:39,889 --> 01:48:42,225
The suit's down. Sorry, Cap.

1336
01:48:43,059 --> 01:48:44,936
Don't worry. I got it.

1337
01:48:46,938 --> 01:48:48,439
Emergency evacuation alert.

1338
01:48:48,648 --> 01:48:51,609
All personnel, proceed to designated safety zones.

1339
01:48:53,194 --> 01:48:55,071
All S.H.I.E.L.D. agents regroup at Rally Point Delta.

1340
01:49:00,785 --> 01:49:02,912
Sir, the Council's been breached.

1341
01:49:03,246 --> 01:49:05,623
- Repeat, Dispatch. - Black Widow's up there.

1342
01:49:05,832 --> 01:49:07,166
Headed up.

1343
01:49:09,377 --> 01:49:10,628
- Falcon? - Yeah.

1344
01:49:10,753 --> 01:49:11,713
Rumlow's headed for the Council.

1345
01:49:11,796 --> 01:49:12,797
I'm on it.

1346
01:49:24,392 --> 01:49:25,435
People are gonna die, Buck.

1347
01:49:27,562 --> 01:49:29,021
I can't let that happen.

1348
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:38,823
Please don't make me do this.

1349
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:50,061
Done.

1350
01:50:51,062 --> 01:50:52,063
And it's trending.

1351
01:50:59,737 --> 01:51:01,572
Unless you want a two-inch hole in your sternum,

1352
01:51:01,656 --> 01:51:02,740
I'd put that gun down.

1353
01:51:05,451 --> 01:51:07,411
That was armed the moment you pinned it on.

1354
01:51:26,264 --> 01:51:27,265
Ahhh!

1355
01:51:41,237 --> 01:51:42,321
Drop it!

1356
01:51:42,947 --> 01:51:43,948
Drop it!

1357
01:52:04,468 --> 01:52:07,722
I'm on 41, headed toward the southwest stairwell.

1358
01:52:14,437 --> 01:52:16,022
This is gonna hurt.

1359
01:52:17,315 --> 01:52:20,401
There are no prisoners with HYDRA. Just order.

1360
01:52:20,610 --> 01:52:22,820
And order only comes through pain.

1361
01:52:24,238 --> 01:52:26,616
- You ready for yours? - Man, shut the hell up.

1362
01:52:28,409 --> 01:52:29,744
Lieutenant, how much longer?

1363
01:52:29,827 --> 01:52:31,913
65 seconds to satellite link.

1364
01:52:31,996 --> 01:52:34,999
Targeting grid engaged. Lowering weapons array now.

1365
01:52:39,003 --> 01:52:40,087
One minute.

1366
01:52:59,982 --> 01:53:01,525
30 seconds, Cap.

1367
01:53:03,152 --> 01:53:04,695
Stand by.

1368
01:53:07,365 --> 01:53:08,991
Charlie...

1369
01:53:18,292 --> 01:53:19,961
We've reached 3,000 feet.

1370
01:53:20,586 --> 01:53:21,587
Sat link coming online now.

1371
01:53:24,131 --> 01:53:25,216
Deploy algorithm.

1372
01:53:26,884 --> 01:53:28,010
Algorithm deployed.

1373
01:53:29,261 --> 01:53:30,721
We are go to target.

1374
01:53:49,782 --> 01:53:51,158
Target saturation reached.

1375
01:53:51,575 --> 01:53:52,576
All targets assigned.

1376
01:53:52,660 --> 01:53:53,661
Fire when ready.

1377
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:57,373
Firing in...

1378
01:53:57,540 --> 01:53:58,582
Three,

1379
01:53:58,874 --> 01:53:59,875
two...

1380
01:54:01,085 --> 01:54:02,420
One.

1381
01:54:05,089 --> 01:54:06,132
Charlie lock.

1382
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:07,591
Where are the targets?

1383
01:54:09,093 --> 01:54:10,094
Where are the targets?

1384
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:11,929
Okay, Cap, get out of there.

1385
01:54:29,363 --> 01:54:30,364
Fire now.

1386
01:54:31,449 --> 01:54:32,700
- But, Steve... - Do it!

1387
01:54:33,451 --> 01:54:34,618
Do it now!

1388
01:55:05,149 --> 01:55:06,150
What a waste.

1389
01:55:06,317 --> 01:55:09,528
So, you still on the fence about Rogers' chances?

1390
01:55:09,737 --> 01:55:12,782
Time to go, Councilwoman. This way. Come on.

1391
01:55:13,282 --> 01:55:14,784
You're going to fly me out of here.

1392
01:55:14,992 --> 01:55:18,162
You know, there was a time I would've taken a bullet for you.

1393
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:19,663
You already did.

1394
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:21,791
You will again, when it's useful.

1395
01:55:35,137 --> 01:55:36,263
Romanoff.

1396
01:55:37,014 --> 01:55:38,099
Natasha.

1397
01:55:40,142 --> 01:55:41,936
Natasha! Come on!

1398
01:55:46,315 --> 01:55:47,566
Ow.

1399
01:55:48,984 --> 01:55:50,528
Those really do sting.

1400
01:56:23,561 --> 01:56:24,979
Hail HYDRA.

1401
01:57:20,451 --> 01:57:21,911
You're out of your depth, kid.

1402
01:57:25,623 --> 01:57:27,124
Son of a bitch!

1403
01:57:39,261 --> 01:57:40,846
Please tell me you got that chopper in the air!

1404
01:57:41,639 --> 01:57:42,765
Sam, where are you?

1405
01:57:43,641 --> 01:57:45,476
41st floor! Northwest corner!

1406
01:57:45,684 --> 01:57:47,228
We're on it! Stay where you are!

1407
01:57:47,436 --> 01:57:48,520
Not an option!

1408
01:58:03,327 --> 01:58:05,496
41st floor! 41st!

1409
01:58:05,829 --> 01:58:09,166
It's not like they put the floor numbers on the outside of the building.

1410
01:58:10,542 --> 01:58:13,045
Hill! Where's Steve? You got a location on Rogers?

1411
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:30,604
You know me.

1412
01:58:32,356 --> 01:58:33,691
No, I don't!

1413
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:44,535
Bucky.

1414
01:58:46,036 --> 01:58:47,496
You've known me your whole life.

1415
01:58:55,045 --> 01:58:58,966
Your name is James Buchanan Barnes.

1416
01:58:59,174 --> 01:59:00,384
Shut up!

1417
01:59:09,101 --> 01:59:10,561
I'm not gonna fight you.

1418
01:59:14,565 --> 01:59:15,899
You're my friend.

1419
01:59:22,906 --> 01:59:24,283
You're my mission.

1420
01:59:26,577 --> 01:59:28,579
You're my mission!

1421
01:59:31,915 --> 01:59:32,916
Then finish it.

1422
01:59:36,420 --> 01:59:38,589
Because I'm with you to the end of the line.

1423
02:01:50,262 --> 02:01:51,597
On your left.

1424
02:02:42,606 --> 02:02:44,983
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,

1425
02:02:45,192 --> 02:02:46,276
and nothing but the truth?

1426
02:02:46,485 --> 02:02:47,903
I do.

1427
02:02:49,905 --> 02:02:51,615
Why haven't we yet heard from Captain Rogers?

1428
02:02:54,326 --> 02:02:56,245
I don't know what there is left for him to say.

1429
02:02:56,453 --> 02:02:58,288
I think the wreck in the middle of the Potomac

1430
02:02:58,497 --> 02:02:59,665
made his point fairly eloquently.

1431
02:02:59,873 --> 02:03:00,832
Well, he could explain how

1432
02:03:01,041 --> 02:03:03,627
this country is expected to maintain its national security

1433
02:03:03,794 --> 02:03:07,923
now that he and you have laid waste to our intelligence apparatus.

1434
02:03:08,340 --> 02:03:10,300
HYDRA was selling you lies, not intelligence.

1435
02:03:10,467 --> 02:03:13,345
Many of which you seemed to have had a personal hand in telling.

1436
02:03:13,554 --> 02:03:14,805
Agent, you should know

1437
02:03:14,972 --> 02:03:16,640
that there are some on this committee

1438
02:03:16,848 --> 02:03:18,976
who feel, given your service record,

1439
02:03:19,142 --> 02:03:20,894
both for this country and against it,

1440
02:03:21,645 --> 02:03:23,397
that you belong in a penitentiary.

1441
02:03:23,605 --> 02:03:25,566
Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.

1442
02:03:27,484 --> 02:03:29,069
You're not going to put me in a prison.

1443
02:03:30,070 --> 02:03:33,991
You're not going to put any of us in a prison. You know why?

1444
02:03:35,450 --> 02:03:36,827
Do enlighten us.

1445
02:03:37,119 --> 02:03:38,453
Because you need us.

1446
02:03:39,580 --> 02:03:41,832
Yes, the world is a vulnerable place,

1447
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:44,209
and yes, we help make it that way.

1448
02:03:44,751 --> 02:03:47,504
But we're also the ones best qualified to defend it.

1449
02:03:49,172 --> 02:03:51,133
So, if you want to arrest me, arrest me.

1450
02:03:52,175 --> 02:03:53,844
You'll know where to find me.

1451
02:04:29,338 --> 02:04:32,174
So, you've experienced this sort of thing before.

1452
02:04:32,674 --> 02:04:34,217
You get used to it.

1453
02:04:36,928 --> 02:04:39,097
We've been data mining HYDRA's files.

1454
02:04:39,306 --> 02:04:41,433
Looks like a lot of rats didn't go down with the ship.

1455
02:04:43,018 --> 02:04:44,353
I'm headed to Europe tonight.

1456
02:04:45,312 --> 02:04:46,563
Wanted to ask if you'd come.

1457
02:04:47,731 --> 02:04:49,358
There's something I got to do first.

1458
02:04:50,275 --> 02:04:52,819
How about you, Wilson? Could use a man with your abilities.

1459
02:04:53,862 --> 02:04:55,572
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

1460
02:04:56,698 --> 02:04:58,450
All right, then.

1461
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:07,292
Anybody asks for me, tell them they can find me, right here.

1462
02:05:09,086 --> 02:05:10,671
You should be honoured. That's about as close as he gets

1463
02:05:10,879 --> 02:05:12,506
to saying thank you.

1464
02:05:13,674 --> 02:05:14,758
Not going with him?

1465
02:05:15,258 --> 02:05:16,510
No.

1466
02:05:16,718 --> 02:05:18,720
- Not staying here. - Nah.

1467
02:05:19,554 --> 02:05:21,598
I blew all my covers. I got to go figure out a new one.

1468
02:05:21,932 --> 02:05:22,933
That might take a while.

1469
02:05:23,433 --> 02:05:25,060
I'm counting on it.

1470
02:05:27,270 --> 02:05:28,397
That thing you asked for,

1471
02:05:28,772 --> 02:05:31,066
I called in a few favours from Kiev.

1472
02:05:34,027 --> 02:05:36,780
Will you do me a favour? Call that nurse.

1473
02:05:37,197 --> 02:05:38,407
She's not a nurse.

1474
02:05:38,615 --> 02:05:40,450
And you're not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

1475
02:05:41,368 --> 02:05:43,453
- What was her name again? - Sharon.

1476
02:05:44,204 --> 02:05:45,205
She's nice.

1477
02:05:57,676 --> 02:05:59,428
Be careful, Steve.

1478
02:06:00,262 --> 02:06:02,013
You might not want to pull on that thread.

1479
02:06:13,567 --> 02:06:15,318
You're going after him.

1480
02:06:15,736 --> 02:06:16,987
You don't have to come with me.

1481
02:06:17,154 --> 02:06:18,238
I know.

1482
02:06:20,198 --> 02:06:21,366
When do we start?

1483
02:08:20,777 --> 02:08:24,406
It's over. Fury has released everything to the public.

1484
02:08:25,115 --> 02:08:26,449
Everything he knows about.

1485
02:08:27,033 --> 02:08:28,869
Herr Strucker, if they get word of our work here,

1486
02:08:29,077 --> 02:08:30,871
if they find out we serve HYDRA...

1487
02:08:31,079 --> 02:08:32,789
HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.

1488
02:08:33,790 --> 02:08:36,626
Two sides of a coin that's no longer currency.

1489
02:08:40,463 --> 02:08:41,965
What we have

1490
02:08:44,009 --> 02:08:46,636
is worth more than any of them ever knew.

1491
02:08:49,264 --> 02:08:52,976
We've only scratched the surface and already,

1492
02:08:55,770 --> 02:08:59,608
there are other facilities doing HYDRA's good work around the world.

1493
02:09:00,775 --> 02:09:04,195
We'll feed them to Captain America and his colourful friends,

1494
02:09:04,404 --> 02:09:06,239
and keep them off our scent.

1495
02:09:06,448 --> 02:09:08,700
What about the volunteers?

1496
02:09:08,909 --> 02:09:10,452
The dead will be buried so deep

1497
02:09:10,660 --> 02:09:12,787
their own ghosts won't be able to find them.

1498
02:09:14,873 --> 02:09:16,124
And the survivors?

1499
02:09:18,251 --> 02:09:19,753
The twins.

1500
02:09:23,340 --> 02:09:26,426
Sooner or later, they will meet the twins.

1501
02:09:28,637 --> 02:09:30,555
It's not a world of spies any more.

1502
02:09:30,764 --> 02:09:32,724
Not even a world of heroes.

1503
02:09:33,725 --> 02:09:36,436
This is the age of miracles, Doctor.

1504
02:09:38,313 --> 02:09:40,607
There's nothing more horrifying

1505
02:09:41,441 --> 02:09:42,567
than a miracle.
