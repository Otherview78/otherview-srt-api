1
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:34,904
<i>Hear me, Ódinn,</i>

2
00:00:35,863 --> 00:00:37,698
<i>All-Father of the Gods.</i>

3
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:41,494
<i>Summon the shadows of ages past,</i>

4
00:00:42,036 --> 00:00:47,250
<i>when the thread spinning Norns
ruled the fates of men.</i>

5
00:00:48,543 --> 00:00:51,254
<i>Hear of a prince's
vengeance quenched</i>

6
00:00:51,337 --> 00:00:53,589
<i>at the fiery Gates of Hel.</i>

7
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,718
<i>A prince destined for Valhöll.</i>

8
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,596
<i>Hear me.</i>

9
00:01:49,186 --> 00:01:50,354
He's here.

10
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:56,861
He's here.

11
00:01:58,696 --> 00:02:00,364
Mother, Father is here!

12
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:05,494
Never enter my chambers
without invitation.

13
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:07,121
The king, milady.
The king.

14
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:14,420
Come.

15
00:02:14,754 --> 00:02:15,921
Ódinn brought him home.

16
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,238
Hail, Raven King!

17
00:02:45,326 --> 00:02:46,702
War Raven, hail!

18
00:02:49,914 --> 00:02:51,082
Hail, my lord!

19
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,212
War Raven, hail.

20
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,714
Hail, ring-giver!

21
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,486
Onward, brother!

22
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,585
Go.

23
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:54,145
Hail, King Aurvandil War Raven!

24
00:03:54,228 --> 00:03:55,354
Hail!

25
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:04,530
Like a battle dog
returning to its master,

26
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:07,908
I've come to be fettered
by my queen's fair locks.

27
00:04:08,868 --> 00:04:11,078
Ever are we bound, my lord.

28
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:15,416
Prince Amleth,

29
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:20,463
you have grown too old
to be greeted as a child.

30
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:26,969
Hail, Lord King.

31
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:34,226
But a father never grows too old

32
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:36,479
for a good smothering!

33
00:04:36,562 --> 00:04:38,481
How I've missed you, my son.

34
00:04:42,318 --> 00:04:44,695
Will your brother not
grace us with his presence?

35
00:04:45,404 --> 00:04:46,614
Think not on Fjölnir.

36
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:48,616
He'll soon be with us.

37
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:20,773
This was worn round a
prince's neck when I found it.

38
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,194
But it was destined
for this prince.

39
00:05:25,903 --> 00:05:28,197
Wear it always with my love.

40
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:29,573
Thank you, Father.

41
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:31,575
My king.

42
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,913
Fjölnir.

43
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:42,253
The brute has arrived.

44
00:05:52,096 --> 00:05:53,681
Hail, Lord King.

45
00:05:56,517 --> 00:06:00,062
Furnish this fierce-hearted
slayer of men with some drink,

46
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:01,564
that I might drink to him.

47
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:05,734
Accept my cup, kinsman.

48
00:06:06,777 --> 00:06:07,862
Milady.

49
00:06:09,947 --> 00:06:12,491
Look how the
queen's cup grows wet

50
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:14,451
for more men than her king.

51
00:06:15,536 --> 00:06:17,788
What metal might
buy a fragrant sip?

52
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:19,498
Sweet silver

53
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,418
or hard iron?

54
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:24,128
Silence, dog!

55
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:28,841
By Freyr, you slander
your lord and mistress!

56
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:30,009
Please you, brother.

57
00:06:30,676 --> 00:06:31,886
'Tis but a jest.

58
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:33,554
A jest.

59
00:06:33,637 --> 00:06:35,556
Heimir keeps a foul tongue,

60
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,350
yet I keep him as
a deep-sworn friend.

61
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,228
Come, brother.

62
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:45,608
Here's one more in need of
your safekeeping than myself.

63
00:06:47,568 --> 00:06:48,611
Thórir.

64
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:51,864
Ah.

65
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:54,283
Thórir!

66
00:06:54,742 --> 00:06:55,993
My son!

67
00:06:57,244 --> 00:07:00,289
To my brother,
the War Raven!

68
00:07:00,372 --> 00:07:02,166
To the Kingdom of Hrafnsey!

69
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:04,001
<i>Skál!</i>

70
00:07:21,518 --> 00:07:23,687
The enemy had
a taste of my liver.

71
00:07:27,858 --> 00:07:29,985
Are you hurt?
Almost enough

72
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:33,072
for Amleth to be
marked my successor.

73
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:37,076
I watched his innocence tonight.

74
00:07:38,577 --> 00:07:40,663
He must be awoken
to what awaits him.

75
00:07:42,456 --> 00:07:43,874
He is a puppy.

76
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,709
He's the same age
as my grandfather

77
00:07:45,793 --> 00:07:47,002
when he took the throne.

78
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:48,379
That was different.

79
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,882
He had to kill his uncle first.

80
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:58,097
You have not seen
your queen in a season.

81
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:00,140
Come.

82
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:03,394
Let me take you to our bed.

83
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:13,612
No.

84
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:18,075
Pray my luck spirits
see me to many war fields

85
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:19,660
after I defeat this wound.

86
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:22,246
I refuse to die in sickness

87
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:25,165
nor live the long life
of a shameful graybeard.

88
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,669
I must die by the sword.

89
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:32,464
I will die in honor.

90
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:37,094
Fret not.

91
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:43,225
You will die in battle, my lord.

92
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:47,229
The Gates of Valhöll
await you, I know it.

93
00:08:57,448 --> 00:09:00,868
This is the same
path I walked with my father

94
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,619
and he with his.

95
00:09:04,538 --> 00:09:07,332
Now it is our path to walk.

96
00:09:52,503 --> 00:09:53,504
Ódinn.

97
00:10:35,921 --> 00:10:37,673
Be not afraid, Amleth.

98
00:10:38,382 --> 00:10:39,550
Do as I do.

99
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:01,905
Who barks?

100
00:11:03,407 --> 00:11:06,201
Is it the wolves
of the High One?

101
00:11:08,996 --> 00:11:12,624
Or is it the barking
of the village dogs?

102
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:17,004
Harken to me,
you two-legged dogs.

103
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,632
Drink the vision mead
of knowledge.

104
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:25,429
To learn what it is
to live and die in honor.

105
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:28,432
To be in battle slain

106
00:11:28,515 --> 00:11:31,977
and in death rewarded
by the Valkyrjur's embrace.

107
00:11:32,853 --> 00:11:34,646
The warrior maidens
will carry you

108
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,441
to the shimmering
Gates of Valhöll.

109
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:43,739
You are dogs that
wish to become men.

110
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:49,578
Prove you are not a dog.

111
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:58,712
Not only are you a man,
you dine like a king.

112
00:12:09,723 --> 00:12:10,933
And you, little cub,

113
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:13,018
what are you?

114
00:12:16,063 --> 00:12:17,856
Ah.

115
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,067
I smell a clever pupil.

116
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:25,072
At every passage,

117
00:12:25,906 --> 00:12:27,991
one should turn his eye round,

118
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:29,743
one should spy round.

119
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:33,372
For a foe might be
crouched within upon the floor.

120
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:36,208
Wise in measure
should each man be,

121
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,710
yet wise enough to be the fool.

122
00:12:38,835 --> 00:12:41,004
Wise enough to be the fool.
Tell me,

123
00:12:42,422 --> 00:12:44,466
how did Ódinn lose his eye?

124
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:46,343
To learn the secret
magic of women.

125
00:12:46,426 --> 00:12:50,722
Never seek the secrets of
women, but heed them always.

126
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:54,226
It is women that
know the mysteries of men.

127
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:59,064
The Norns that spin and weave
at their Well of Fate.

128
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:00,899
Live in honor.

129
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:01,984
Live in honor.

130
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:03,819
Safeguard your familial blood.

131
00:13:03,902 --> 00:13:05,904
Safeguard your familial blood.

132
00:13:05,988 --> 00:13:08,532
Know you what that means,
Amleth, son of Aurvandil?

133
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,703
Should I fall by
the enemy's sword,

134
00:13:12,786 --> 00:13:16,999
you must avenge me
or forever live in shame!

135
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:19,001
I will, Father, I will!

136
00:13:19,084 --> 00:13:20,252
My blade will not rest

137
00:13:20,335 --> 00:13:22,129
till it's drunk the blood
from his open neck!

138
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:24,715
Now live always without fear,

139
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:28,635
for your fate is set
and you cannot scape it.

140
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:30,470
Swear it.

141
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,264
I swear.

142
00:14:14,973 --> 00:14:18,518
This is the last tear
you will shed in weakness.

143
00:14:19,478 --> 00:14:22,522
It will be given back
when most you need it.

144
00:14:24,608 --> 00:14:26,777
Now, behold,

145
00:14:28,153 --> 00:14:29,404
as a man.

146
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:40,791
Approach,
Amleth, and in our blood

147
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:44,878
behold the tree of kings.

148
00:16:30,901 --> 00:16:31,943
Father!

149
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:35,697
Run! Run!

150
00:16:43,413 --> 00:16:46,333
Come for your carcass,
you mongrels!

151
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:43,807
You behold your brother's
gaze in amazement.

152
00:17:46,518 --> 00:17:47,978
I knew well you would.

153
00:17:50,855 --> 00:17:54,025
Pity you never paid
a bastard's eyes heed before.

154
00:17:57,237 --> 00:18:02,450
Now, behold how swiftly
your brother swings his sword.

155
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:08,290
Strike, brother.

156
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:09,916
Strike.

157
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:15,380
But know that bearing a stolen
ring makes no half-breed a king.

158
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:18,717
Soaked in my blood,

159
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,972
it will soon be sliding
off your arm like a serpent.

160
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:28,768
Your kingdom will not last.

161
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:37,986
Let this misdeed
haunt your living nights

162
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:42,699
till a flaming vengeance
gorges on your death.

163
00:18:45,785 --> 00:18:46,911
Strike.

164
00:18:49,331 --> 00:18:50,373
Strike!

165
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,709
To Valhöll!

166
00:19:05,722 --> 00:19:07,974
King Aurvandil is dead!

167
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:11,561
Long live King Fjölnir!

168
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:13,229
Long live King Fjölnir!

169
00:19:13,647 --> 00:19:15,106
Hail, Lord King!

170
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:17,108
Hail, Lord King!

171
00:19:22,197 --> 00:19:23,615
Bring me the boy's head!

172
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,591
Do you see him?

173
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:44,469
- Over here.
- Cut him off!

174
00:20:06,866 --> 00:20:08,284
I'll make it slow.

175
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,116
Hail, Fjölnir the Brother less!

176
00:20:48,658 --> 00:20:50,201
Hail, King Fjölnir!

177
00:20:50,827 --> 00:20:52,078
Hail, Fjölnir!

178
00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:58,084
Hail, King Fjölnir!

179
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:02,672
King Fjölnir
has found himself a queen.

180
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,385
Fjölnir!

181
00:21:07,469 --> 00:21:09,095
Fjölnir! My lord!

182
00:21:10,263 --> 00:21:11,306
The boy!

183
00:21:12,182 --> 00:21:13,224
The boy.

184
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,896
The boy is dead.

185
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:20,231
Dead in the sea.

186
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:22,192
Yeah.

187
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:24,194
Sank like a stone.

188
00:21:32,952 --> 00:21:34,370
I will avenge you, Father!

189
00:21:34,913 --> 00:21:36,080
I will save you, Mother!

190
00:21:36,623 --> 00:21:37,999
I will kill you, Fjölnir!

191
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,001
I will avenge you, Father!

192
00:21:40,543 --> 00:21:41,711
I will save you, Mother!

193
00:21:42,128 --> 00:21:43,338
I will kill you, Fjölnir!

194
00:21:44,005 --> 00:21:45,256
I will avenge you, Father!

195
00:21:45,757 --> 00:21:47,008
I will save you, Mother!

196
00:21:47,717 --> 00:21:49,052
I will kill you, Fjölnir!

197
00:21:49,636 --> 00:21:51,012
I will avenge you, Father!

198
00:21:51,513 --> 00:21:52,806
I will save you, Mother!

199
00:26:03,097 --> 00:26:04,807
To Valhöll!

200
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,228
No!

201
00:28:19,275 --> 00:28:21,736
What are you doing?
Come now, come. Come here.

202
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:22,862
Come here.

203
00:28:41,422 --> 00:28:44,342
These savages make
for fine chattel,

204
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:46,594
eh, Björnulfr?

205
00:28:47,136 --> 00:28:48,221
We did good.

206
00:28:49,388 --> 00:28:50,598
Never better.

207
00:28:54,602 --> 00:28:56,395
When we found you as a cub...

208
00:28:58,231 --> 00:29:02,276
I knew then that you had
a heart of cold iron.

209
00:29:02,777 --> 00:29:03,861
Too weak!

210
00:29:04,487 --> 00:29:05,988
I want strong ones!

211
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:07,657
Not weak ones!

212
00:29:19,085 --> 00:29:20,169
Mama!

213
00:29:23,547 --> 00:29:24,548
Mama!

214
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:27,802
Mama!

215
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,641
Mama!

216
00:29:42,775 --> 00:29:43,901
Mama!

217
00:29:46,404 --> 00:29:47,905
Mama!

218
00:29:50,032 --> 00:29:51,284
Mama!

219
00:30:29,238 --> 00:30:30,948
Play, you idiot. Play!

220
00:32:18,055 --> 00:32:21,684
Prowl in
shadow, slayer of my people.

221
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:23,853
Hide.

222
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:29,358
Even though your
brother stole my eyes,

223
00:32:31,235 --> 00:32:32,319
I see you.

224
00:32:34,613 --> 00:32:36,115
I am no one's brother.

225
00:32:37,324 --> 00:32:41,662
It is not enough to be
the man that never cries,

226
00:32:42,163 --> 00:32:44,290
Prince Amleth.

227
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:50,004
The prince
that turned from his fate.

228
00:32:51,297 --> 00:32:54,425
A beast that cares for naught.

229
00:32:55,092 --> 00:32:58,596
A beast that wrings tears
from the eyes of men.

230
00:33:01,098 --> 00:33:06,604
Now remember for whom
you shed your last teardrop.

231
00:33:07,146 --> 00:33:09,565
Remember the oath
to right the wrong.

232
00:33:11,108 --> 00:33:13,486
Remember the Raven King.

233
00:33:14,069 --> 00:33:15,112
Remember.

234
00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:20,534
Remember,
it contains the salty ocean

235
00:33:20,659 --> 00:33:24,371
you must sail upon,
to the edge of the world.

236
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:28,834
It feeds the freezing river
of hate that runs in my veins.

237
00:33:29,126 --> 00:33:32,463
It will take you
to an island in the north

238
00:33:33,422 --> 00:33:36,675
where there will spring
a burning lake,

239
00:33:37,301 --> 00:33:40,221
bursting from
a black mountain's peak.

240
00:33:40,304 --> 00:33:44,099
There, I will drown
my father's killer.

241
00:33:44,725 --> 00:33:47,144
Follow the vixen's tail

242
00:33:47,228 --> 00:33:49,271
to the dwelling of
the ancient one

243
00:33:49,605 --> 00:33:54,527
to seek the fated sword
that matches your brutal rage.

244
00:33:54,818 --> 00:33:57,947
Why speak you my fortune, witch?

245
00:33:58,948 --> 00:34:02,243
For where your path
of ashes ends,

246
00:34:03,202 --> 00:34:06,497
another will begin her journey.

247
00:34:07,748 --> 00:34:08,958
A maiden king.

248
00:34:10,584 --> 00:34:11,585
Release me.

249
00:34:11,835 --> 00:34:15,172
You cannot escape what fate
the Norns have spun.

250
00:34:16,507 --> 00:34:18,884
Now, begone!

251
00:34:23,556 --> 00:34:25,558
These slaves go to Uppsala.

252
00:34:28,477 --> 00:34:30,563
Those to the market in Kiev.

253
00:34:34,441 --> 00:34:36,151
Send them to Constantinople.

254
00:34:37,111 --> 00:34:40,489
And these strong ones
should make it all the way

255
00:34:40,573 --> 00:34:42,658
to Fjölnir's post in Iceland.

256
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,495
Who is this Fjölnir?

257
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:48,956
Fjölnir the Brother less.

258
00:34:49,415 --> 00:34:51,208
So-called after he
killed his brother,

259
00:34:51,292 --> 00:34:54,253
the disgraced
King Aurvandil War Raven.

260
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,339
I know of him.

261
00:34:58,257 --> 00:35:00,092
Why are his slaves
bound for Iceland?

262
00:35:00,676 --> 00:35:02,344
Fjölnir rules over Hrafnsey.

263
00:35:03,137 --> 00:35:05,222
He fled
to the backwater frontier,

264
00:35:05,306 --> 00:35:07,099
with his wife and son

265
00:35:07,558 --> 00:35:11,437
after King Haraldr of Norway
took his kingdom.

266
00:35:11,854 --> 00:35:13,897
Fjölnir killed his brother
for nothing.

267
00:35:13,981 --> 00:35:15,482
Now he's a sheep farmer.

268
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,040
Father.

269
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:55,522
Worry not.

270
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:59,360
When I meet your owner, I will
thank him for the warmth you gave me.

271
00:36:26,845 --> 00:36:28,055
Take your place.

272
00:37:29,658 --> 00:37:30,784
He's cheating.

273
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,662
Let's see what you've got.

274
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:35,539
It continues then.

275
00:37:37,082 --> 00:37:38,876
I've lost all my silver, then.

276
00:37:45,174 --> 00:37:47,134
Your sheep's clothing
does not disguise you,

277
00:37:47,217 --> 00:37:48,343
Northman.

278
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:51,847
What say you, spell-speaker?

279
00:37:53,015 --> 00:37:54,558
You wish to be a slave,

280
00:37:56,018 --> 00:37:57,186
hide your cunning.

281
00:37:59,438 --> 00:38:01,106
Show the shepherd,
you are a sheep.

282
00:38:02,024 --> 00:38:03,734
I'll show the shepherd
his death.

283
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:13,786
Hold it strong!

284
00:38:18,665 --> 00:38:19,917
Stay on your feet!

285
00:38:22,044 --> 00:38:23,086
Take my hand!

286
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,381
I have you!

287
00:39:28,694 --> 00:39:30,237
<i>I will avenge you, Father.</i>

288
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:32,239
<i>I will save you, Mother.</i>

289
00:39:32,948 --> 00:39:34,408
<i>I will kill you, Fjölnir.</i>

290
00:40:08,233 --> 00:40:09,276
Over there.

291
00:40:14,615 --> 00:40:15,866
Leave her here.

292
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:18,160
Move!

293
00:40:28,128 --> 00:40:30,923
- Bunch of corpses.
- Let him rot!

294
00:40:32,674 --> 00:40:34,301
The seagulls will eat him!

295
00:40:34,927 --> 00:40:36,178
They're hungry!

296
00:40:40,182 --> 00:40:42,434
Move, swine!

297
00:41:12,631 --> 00:41:15,133
Why would you stow away
to such a hellish place?

298
00:41:15,968 --> 00:41:17,678
This ground harbors evil.

299
00:41:18,804 --> 00:41:20,347
My fate has brought me here.

300
00:41:21,682 --> 00:41:23,350
To find what was stolen from me.

301
00:41:24,101 --> 00:41:25,143
And what is that?

302
00:41:26,853 --> 00:41:30,899
A mother, a father, a kingdom.

303
00:41:32,693 --> 00:41:33,902
This is your kingdom?

304
00:41:34,403 --> 00:41:36,655
The traitor who stole
my kingdom fled here

305
00:41:36,738 --> 00:41:38,115
when another king
took it from him.

306
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:41,660
I will leave
when I'm done with him.

307
00:41:43,996 --> 00:41:45,998
I am Olga of the Birch Forest.

308
00:41:47,457 --> 00:41:49,418
And I, too, vow to
escape this island.

309
00:41:50,544 --> 00:41:52,254
Then you must face many foes.

310
00:41:53,296 --> 00:41:54,297
As do you.

311
00:41:56,883 --> 00:41:58,135
Would you face them alone?

312
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:03,265
Your strength
breaks men's bones.

313
00:42:04,558 --> 00:42:06,643
I have the cunning
to break their minds.

314
00:42:07,144 --> 00:42:09,229
You two, hold your traps!

315
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:10,731
Walk on!

316
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,674
Why are we doing this?

317
00:42:38,258 --> 00:42:39,259
What?

318
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:41,386
This.
What?

319
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:43,138
It's slave work.

320
00:42:44,014 --> 00:42:45,307
You're the chieftain.

321
00:42:45,724 --> 00:42:47,184
It's your temple,

322
00:42:47,476 --> 00:42:49,895
and I'm the heir
to this holy chiefdom.

323
00:42:49,978 --> 00:42:53,398
No man knows if he will
celebrate next yuletide

324
00:42:53,482 --> 00:42:55,150
as a king or as a slave.

325
00:42:56,276 --> 00:42:58,028
Best to be prepared for both.

326
00:42:58,612 --> 00:43:01,114
And to stave off the latter,
the least you can do

327
00:43:01,198 --> 00:43:03,742
is show your slaves
you're as strong as they are.

328
00:43:06,536 --> 00:43:08,997
But no one's watching us.

329
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:12,584
Go fetch us some whey.

330
00:43:13,043 --> 00:43:14,503
Think on what I said.

331
00:43:14,586 --> 00:43:16,546
- Keep your shield arm up.
- I am.

332
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,839
- You're...
- I am!

333
00:43:17,923 --> 00:43:18,924
You are not!

334
00:43:19,007 --> 00:43:20,008
Attack, Hjalti!

335
00:43:23,595 --> 00:43:25,514
No! No!

336
00:43:29,976 --> 00:43:31,394
Fjölnir, my lord!

337
00:43:34,815 --> 00:43:36,483
Your shipment is here.

338
00:43:38,985 --> 00:43:41,071
Well, show me.

339
00:43:41,905 --> 00:43:44,241
- Where's the rest of them?
- Get on your feet!

340
00:43:44,324 --> 00:43:46,159
On your feet!
On your feet!

341
00:43:46,243 --> 00:43:47,786
Up, swines!

342
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,538
Line up, bastards!

343
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:56,211
Pitiful.
Can't even stand.

344
00:44:02,092 --> 00:44:03,552
They won't last the winter.

345
00:44:05,428 --> 00:44:06,721
Sell all of them.

346
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,152
Let me see this one.

347
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:37,294
We've kept worse.

348
00:44:49,431 --> 00:44:51,099
I'm not impressed.

349
00:44:53,101 --> 00:44:54,186
His stench.

350
00:44:58,648 --> 00:45:00,901
Never look me in the eye, slave.

351
00:45:03,111 --> 00:45:06,615
Well, I wonder what
they call a beast like you

352
00:45:06,698 --> 00:45:07,991
in the Land of Rus.

353
00:45:11,578 --> 00:45:13,038
I am...

354
00:45:13,997 --> 00:45:16,124
Björnulfr.

355
00:45:16,958 --> 00:45:19,878
By name alone, you can
tell he's as strong as a bear.

356
00:45:24,633 --> 00:45:27,135
But if you're as
untrustworthy as a wolf,

357
00:45:27,219 --> 00:45:29,554
I swear I'll put
you down myself.

358
00:45:33,975 --> 00:45:35,268
We keep this one.

359
00:45:36,978 --> 00:45:38,021
The rest can go.

360
00:45:41,066 --> 00:45:43,693
But mother needs
two for the kitchen,

361
00:45:43,777 --> 00:45:45,445
- and one for the laundry.
- Move.

362
00:45:45,528 --> 00:45:47,280
And two males for the harvest.

363
00:45:47,656 --> 00:45:48,657
Fine.

364
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,368
These two for the kitchen,
and her for the laundry.

365
00:45:52,327 --> 00:45:54,704
And choose two males
for the fields.

366
00:45:56,998 --> 00:45:58,583
And her, too.

367
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:02,212
Keep her arms white,

368
00:46:04,297 --> 00:46:06,216
and her hair long.

369
00:46:27,237 --> 00:46:29,739
Plan to climb out,
huh, Bear-Wolf?

370
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,743
Even if you did
escape this farm,

371
00:46:34,577 --> 00:46:38,081
you'd only be carrion for
the blue foxes and selkies.

372
00:46:39,749 --> 00:46:41,626
This island is a barren waste.

373
00:46:42,711 --> 00:46:44,713
You best find yourself
some sleep.

374
00:47:34,054 --> 00:47:35,847
Get! Get!

375
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:37,349
Get!

376
00:47:38,892 --> 00:47:40,226
Thieving demon-bitch.

377
00:47:55,617 --> 00:47:57,494
Away! Away!

378
00:48:00,372 --> 00:48:01,456
Away with you!

379
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,293
Away! Begone!

380
00:48:09,756 --> 00:48:10,840
Away with you!

381
00:48:13,218 --> 00:48:14,594
I will avenge you, Father.

382
00:48:17,013 --> 00:48:18,473
I will save you, Mother.

383
00:48:20,642 --> 00:48:22,185
I will kill you, Fjölnir.

384
00:48:29,943 --> 00:48:31,528
Here. Go.

385
00:49:11,151 --> 00:49:12,152
Go take a piss.

386
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:16,531
In there.

387
00:49:30,712 --> 00:49:31,754
Stop there.

388
00:49:51,232 --> 00:49:53,067
You! Get on with it!

389
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:54,486
On with you now!

390
00:50:10,043 --> 00:50:11,169
Where's your wits?

391
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:13,171
Turn around.

392
00:50:26,226 --> 00:50:27,227
Shut the door.

393
00:50:45,078 --> 00:50:46,120
Did you find it?

394
00:50:47,539 --> 00:50:48,540
What you lost.

395
00:50:50,542 --> 00:50:52,168
In the house today,
was it there?

396
00:50:54,546 --> 00:50:55,547
That...

397
00:50:56,798 --> 00:50:57,882
and more.

398
00:51:05,932 --> 00:51:07,100
It's a nightmare.

399
00:51:10,395 --> 00:51:11,980
Then you must wake up.

400
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,275
It's their nightmare.

401
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,361
You!

402
00:51:19,279 --> 00:51:20,572
You, woman!

403
00:51:20,947 --> 00:51:22,073
You come with us!

404
00:51:23,575 --> 00:51:25,118
You don't belong here!

405
00:51:25,952 --> 00:51:27,453
Fjölnir wants you close.

406
00:51:28,162 --> 00:51:30,415
If you lose me, will you
come and look for me, too?

407
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:32,792
Will you?

408
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:33,876
Come here.

409
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,785
Sit, Amleth, son of Aurvandil.

410
00:53:32,954 --> 00:53:34,997
Did our hen-eating friend
tell you of me?

411
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:38,459
No.

412
00:53:41,796 --> 00:53:43,715
One much more talkative.

413
00:53:47,719 --> 00:53:49,303
An old fool.

414
00:53:51,848 --> 00:53:52,890
Poor Heimir.

415
00:53:54,684 --> 00:53:56,769
He speaks of days past,

416
00:53:58,229 --> 00:54:00,148
and days yet to come.

417
00:54:03,651 --> 00:54:05,820
Fjölnir cut out his tongue,

418
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,242
plucked out his eyes
before killing him,

419
00:54:13,911 --> 00:54:16,205
but I made him once anew.

420
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:20,626
Kind friend.

421
00:54:21,878 --> 00:54:23,796
Know that
I will avenge you, too.

422
00:54:23,921 --> 00:54:26,257
I fear you must address me.

423
00:54:27,258 --> 00:54:30,428
Alas, I made him no new ears.

424
00:54:31,554 --> 00:54:34,724
They also met
with Fjölnir's blade.

425
00:54:34,807 --> 00:54:35,850
Enough!

426
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:37,643
You know why I have come.

427
00:54:37,727 --> 00:54:41,856
You are still a beast
cloaked in man-flesh.

428
00:54:41,939 --> 00:54:43,441
Speak, witch.

429
00:54:43,524 --> 00:54:45,109
So be it, slave!

430
00:55:04,921 --> 00:55:06,756
Wandering prophet.

431
00:55:13,262 --> 00:55:14,889
Wake now,

432
00:55:17,183 --> 00:55:19,477
from your murder.

433
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,247
Hear me!

434
00:55:40,164 --> 00:55:43,167
Heimir is come!

435
00:55:48,172 --> 00:55:50,716
<i>Hello, puppy.</i>

436
00:55:51,968 --> 00:55:55,638
I seek the weapon the Norns of
Fate chose for my revenge.

437
00:55:57,265 --> 00:55:58,975
<i>Hear me.</i>

438
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:03,479
<i>Forged by the deadliest
war-smiths</i>

439
00:56:03,563 --> 00:56:08,609
<i>ever to crawl from under
the great worm's belly.</i>

440
00:56:09,151 --> 00:56:14,699
<i>A sword of the most
secretive rare iron,</i>

441
00:56:15,658 --> 00:56:19,120
<i>bound with bone of the jötnar.</i>

442
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,747
<i>Weightless in its owner's hand,</i>

443
00:56:21,831 --> 00:56:24,166
<i>yet like a dragon's fang,</i>

444
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,502
<i>its bite can never be dulled,</i>

445
00:56:26,586 --> 00:56:28,462
<i>never broken nor bent.</i>

446
00:56:29,005 --> 00:56:33,009
<i>Its blade could only be
quenched in human blood.</i>

447
00:56:35,386 --> 00:56:38,973
<i>It is a battle flame like none
other.</i>

448
00:56:40,141 --> 00:56:41,350
<i>Its name,</i>

449
00:56:41,767 --> 00:56:44,270
<i>Draugr.</i>

450
00:56:44,353 --> 00:56:46,063
<i>The Undead.</i>

451
00:56:50,818 --> 00:56:52,445
<i>It is fated.</i>

452
00:56:52,945 --> 00:56:54,113
<i>Draugr!</i>

453
00:57:06,292 --> 00:57:10,338
Yet, difficult is
the sword's nature,

454
00:57:11,339 --> 00:57:15,384
for it can only be unsheathed
in the dark of night,

455
00:57:15,927 --> 00:57:18,137
or else at Hel's black gates.

456
00:57:18,387 --> 00:57:19,555
The Gates of Hel.

457
00:57:20,806 --> 00:57:22,350
There will my sword be just.

458
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:26,938
I will enjoy feeding Draugr
till then in everlasting night.

459
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,067
Then shall you also enjoy the
moment when you must choose

460
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:35,863
between kindness for your kin
or hate for your enemies.

461
00:57:36,155 --> 00:57:37,239
That is nothing.

462
00:57:38,491 --> 00:57:40,326
My heart knows only revenge.

463
00:57:43,245 --> 00:57:44,372
Show it to me.

464
00:57:45,247 --> 00:57:48,042
You must make a visitation
to Draugr's owner,

465
00:57:48,668 --> 00:57:50,044
the mound dweller.

466
00:57:57,426 --> 00:57:59,595
Mark well the full moon's light.

467
00:58:01,597 --> 00:58:04,934
For shadows are
not hospitable hosts.

468
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:53,435
Mark well the full moon's light!

469
01:02:29,031 --> 01:02:31,700
Thórir will
choose our strongest.

470
01:02:32,618 --> 01:02:35,037
Tomorrow we'll prove
that Hákon Iron-Beard's men

471
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,623
are born of mud and water.

472
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:41,710
Mud will be
all that remains of them.

473
01:02:43,796 --> 01:02:44,880
Rakki!

474
01:02:58,435 --> 01:02:59,436
Rakki!

475
01:03:11,365 --> 01:03:12,449
Rakki.

476
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,326
Take Rakki home.

477
01:03:15,828 --> 01:03:17,371
- And, you two.
- Rakki, come.

478
01:03:17,454 --> 01:03:19,540
It's nearly dawn.
Get you to bed.

479
01:03:19,623 --> 01:03:21,041
Yes, my lord.
Rakki.

480
01:03:32,303 --> 01:03:33,387
Wake, you.

481
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:37,599
Fetch her. You
know the one. Aye.

482
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:41,729
Wake
up, Olga. Wake up.

483
01:03:42,062 --> 01:03:43,063
Get to your feet.

484
01:03:51,572 --> 01:03:53,365
The hair of a Valkyrja,

485
01:03:54,908 --> 01:03:57,119
on a savage Slav bitch.

486
01:04:02,958 --> 01:04:04,001
A little blood.

487
01:04:07,338 --> 01:04:08,714
Unclean whore!

488
01:04:13,886 --> 01:04:17,639
You will correct her, or you'll
both be dead in the ground.

489
01:04:35,157 --> 01:04:37,076
Thank the Norns
that the woman's tide

490
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:41,038
is the only blood that runs
in your house tonight, coward.

491
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:45,876
I am a fool.

492
01:04:47,336 --> 01:04:50,881
It was foretold that I would slay
my father's killer in a burning lake.

493
01:04:52,383 --> 01:04:53,634
Till that day comes,

494
01:04:54,551 --> 01:04:57,137
I will torment the man
who made my life a hell.

495
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:02,059
Now sleep well, night blade.

496
01:05:03,852 --> 01:05:07,064
Yes, we thirst for vengeance,

497
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,150
but we cannot escape our fates.

498
01:05:22,955 --> 01:05:25,207
Get them in line! Look lively!

499
01:05:29,837 --> 01:05:32,005
- Move it!
- Don't be idle!

500
01:05:32,089 --> 01:05:33,632
Those are for the feast.

501
01:05:35,384 --> 01:05:36,718
Where are they taking us?

502
01:05:37,386 --> 01:05:39,263
Something about
the chieftain's feast.

503
01:05:40,681 --> 01:05:42,933
Last night, I saw him with you.

504
01:05:48,522 --> 01:05:50,941
Then you know Fjölnir's touch
will not linger on me

505
01:05:51,024 --> 01:05:52,109
when I leave this island.

506
01:05:52,693 --> 01:05:53,902
You marked him well.

507
01:05:55,487 --> 01:05:56,687
And I have found the cold iron

508
01:05:56,738 --> 01:05:57,906
that will strike him down.

509
01:06:01,452 --> 01:06:03,495
When will you do it?
When I must.

510
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:06,123
For now, I will haunt this farm

511
01:06:06,206 --> 01:06:08,333
like a hungry corpse
returned from the grave.

512
01:06:09,918 --> 01:06:11,420
Fjölnir thinks
Amleth is long dead.

513
01:06:12,087 --> 01:06:14,506
Yes, but what of your mother?

514
01:06:15,507 --> 01:06:17,551
She will revel
in Fjölnir's anguish.

515
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:20,762
She only feigns her love
to protect their child.

516
01:06:21,472 --> 01:06:23,182
Won't she wish...
When I free her,

517
01:06:23,265 --> 01:06:24,975
I will bring the boy if I must.

518
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:28,103
They've moved me back
into the kitchen.

519
01:06:28,187 --> 01:06:29,330
Björnulfr!
If we can keep his men...

520
01:06:29,354 --> 01:06:30,981
Our plan will have to wait. Go.

521
01:06:31,064 --> 01:06:32,441
Björnulfr, move!

522
01:06:38,906 --> 01:06:40,866
- You, to the back!
- Move!

523
01:06:40,949 --> 01:06:42,159
Woman!

524
01:06:46,497 --> 01:06:48,582
Thórir, my Lord,
we're lacking one man.

525
01:06:54,004 --> 01:06:56,590
I'm not a child.
My hair is my own.

526
01:06:56,673 --> 01:06:59,510
I know grown men who need
a woman to tend their hair.

527
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:02,846
Get them in line.

528
01:07:02,971 --> 01:07:06,934
You can celebrate
after the games, slave. Look lively!

529
01:07:09,061 --> 01:07:10,145
My lord.

530
01:07:10,979 --> 01:07:12,147
Come on!

531
01:07:12,731 --> 01:07:13,815
Thórir, my lord.

532
01:07:20,822 --> 01:07:22,032
Can you fight, slave?

533
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:26,161
Look me in the eye, slave.

534
01:07:27,829 --> 01:07:29,706
I asked you do you know
how to fight.

535
01:07:55,774 --> 01:07:56,858
What are those?

536
01:07:58,443 --> 01:08:00,112
You've never seen
a <i>knatttré</i> before?

537
01:08:04,116 --> 01:08:06,118
By nightfall, you'll have
seen enough of them.

538
01:08:25,178 --> 01:08:26,597
Play for blood!

539
01:09:44,257 --> 01:09:46,426
You're shaming
our family's name!

540
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:48,303
We need more men!

541
01:10:00,816 --> 01:10:02,317
Yeah!

542
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:07,364
No! No!

543
01:10:37,394 --> 01:10:39,604
Gunnar!
No!

544
01:10:39,730 --> 01:10:41,815
Halt the game!
Halt it now!

545
01:10:41,898 --> 01:10:43,191
Don't touch him!

546
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:45,026
Gunnar!

547
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:46,236
Halt the game!

548
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:47,571
Gunnar! Gunnar!

549
01:10:48,238 --> 01:10:49,364
Stupid runt!

550
01:10:49,489 --> 01:10:50,657
No!

551
01:11:10,844 --> 01:11:12,846
- Gunnar. Gunnar.
- Wake up. Wake up.

552
01:11:12,929 --> 01:11:15,015
Stupid, stupid boy.
Wake up.

553
01:11:16,725 --> 01:11:19,102
Gunnar. Gunnar.
Gunnar. FJÖLNIR: Gunnar.

554
01:11:19,186 --> 01:11:20,604
Wake up, come on.

555
01:11:20,687 --> 01:11:22,689
Wake up, Gunnar.
Wake up!

556
01:11:22,814 --> 01:11:25,108
Gunnar. Gunnar. Gunnar.

557
01:11:25,192 --> 01:11:26,777
Wake up.
Gunnar. Gunnar.

558
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:27,986
Wake up!
No.

559
01:11:31,281 --> 01:11:32,282
Wake up.

560
01:11:36,953 --> 01:11:37,954
Did we win?

561
01:11:40,415 --> 01:11:43,418
Spoken like
a true chieftain's son.

562
01:11:45,504 --> 01:11:46,588
A brave boy.

563
01:11:47,172 --> 01:11:48,256
A brave young man.

564
01:12:56,324 --> 01:12:57,409
You.

565
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:02,914
This way.

566
01:13:13,174 --> 01:13:14,467
You showed yourself brave

567
01:13:15,635 --> 01:13:16,636
and loyal.

568
01:13:18,013 --> 01:13:19,389
When we return to the farm,

569
01:13:19,472 --> 01:13:21,975
certain privileges
will be granted you.

570
01:13:22,475 --> 01:13:24,477
Your work will be less
burdensome.

571
01:13:24,561 --> 01:13:27,272
You will command others' burden.

572
01:13:28,064 --> 01:13:29,774
And, Björnulfr,

573
01:13:31,484 --> 01:13:33,069
as a reward
for winning us the game,

574
01:13:33,153 --> 01:13:34,988
I'll let you choose
a woman for yourself.

575
01:13:35,697 --> 01:13:38,241
Even that Slav bitch
I've seen you eyeing.

576
01:13:39,075 --> 01:13:43,371
Father found her too...
unyielding.

577
01:13:52,213 --> 01:13:55,133
But know that we will never
make you a free man.

578
01:13:57,302 --> 01:14:00,388
The stench of a lowborn slave
cannot escape him.

579
01:14:03,266 --> 01:14:04,267
Yes.

580
01:14:05,685 --> 01:14:06,686
Thank you.

581
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,986
We'll miss you
cleaning the shit house.

582
01:14:54,901 --> 01:14:55,986
Olga.

583
01:15:06,538 --> 01:15:07,580
You found me.

584
01:15:11,376 --> 01:15:12,377
Were you lost?

585
01:15:15,171 --> 01:15:16,881
Only if you were
searching for me.

586
01:15:49,664 --> 01:15:50,832
What do you do?

587
01:15:54,711 --> 01:15:58,298
Here, where the threads of
fate have bound us together,

588
01:15:59,507 --> 01:16:03,511
embraced beneath the trees,
here I speak with the earth.

589
01:16:05,055 --> 01:16:06,181
What does she tell you?

590
01:16:13,855 --> 01:16:15,857
How to reach your mother.

591
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:21,112
My earth magic will stoke
the flames of your sword.

592
01:16:35,502 --> 01:16:37,253
Tomorrow night, you and I,

593
01:16:39,547 --> 01:16:41,216
will begin this nightmare

594
01:16:42,967 --> 01:16:45,970
and bring Fjölnir's life
to chaos.

595
01:16:54,813 --> 01:16:55,814
Finish.

596
01:17:00,193 --> 01:17:01,402
Back to the stalls.

597
01:17:05,448 --> 01:17:09,244
Hey, hey. Hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

598
01:17:11,538 --> 01:17:12,622
You.

599
01:17:28,888 --> 01:17:30,390
The servants of Freyr.

600
01:17:31,808 --> 01:17:33,893
Lay them before our lord's feet.

601
01:18:17,896 --> 01:18:19,439
You weakling.

602
01:18:34,704 --> 01:18:35,747
Fear not.

603
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:36,831
You're the first of many.

604
01:18:36,956 --> 01:18:38,625
No. HERSVEINN:
Please! We'll set you free!

605
01:18:44,297 --> 01:18:46,174
Oh, I will find who did this.

606
01:18:47,008 --> 01:18:50,762
I will find them, and I
will tear out their eyes!

607
01:18:51,304 --> 01:18:53,848
And I will
tear out their tongues!

608
01:18:54,307 --> 01:18:58,186
They will all sup in Hel!

609
01:18:59,896 --> 01:19:00,980
Look, Father.

610
01:19:01,272 --> 01:19:03,358
Look what has been done
to my brave friends.

611
01:19:04,984 --> 01:19:06,444
Christian monsters!

612
01:19:06,986 --> 01:19:08,154
Monsters!

613
01:19:09,656 --> 01:19:10,907
Monsters!

614
01:19:10,990 --> 01:19:13,660
Lack-beard, did you do this?

615
01:19:13,743 --> 01:19:16,663
Answer me!
Answer me!

616
01:19:16,829 --> 01:19:18,289
Stop this!

617
01:19:18,373 --> 01:19:19,832
Son.

618
01:19:21,793 --> 01:19:23,795
Regain your calm.

619
01:19:28,758 --> 01:19:30,260
They were good boys.

620
01:19:32,262 --> 01:19:35,807
By Freyr, we will avenge them.

621
01:19:37,976 --> 01:19:38,977
Take him away.

622
01:19:42,730 --> 01:19:43,982
Is Thórir right?

623
01:19:44,941 --> 01:19:46,818
Could it be
the Christian swines?

624
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:53,700
Their God is a corpse
nailed to a tree. For what?

625
01:19:56,119 --> 01:19:58,371
These boys never touched them.

626
01:19:58,454 --> 01:20:00,748
And how might they find weapons?

627
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:22,145
No.

628
01:20:23,021 --> 01:20:26,024
These wounds
are not of our world.

629
01:20:32,155 --> 01:20:35,825
This distempered spirit
will ride again.

630
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:39,329
It wields a hungry blade.

631
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:43,291
Go.

632
01:20:43,416 --> 01:20:45,335
I will prepare a sacrifice.

633
01:20:48,838 --> 01:20:50,340
On with you!

634
01:20:51,174 --> 01:20:53,760
Blood-drinking Christians!

635
01:20:53,843 --> 01:20:55,803
Do as you're told.

636
01:20:58,306 --> 01:20:59,307
Go.

637
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:03,853
The mushrooms, I have them.

638
01:21:04,312 --> 01:21:05,313
Not tonight.

639
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:07,732
The spirits will ride
and spill more blood.

640
01:21:38,846 --> 01:21:42,350
Black she-spirit, abate.

641
01:21:43,559 --> 01:21:46,479
Bear this offering
to your mistress

642
01:21:47,021 --> 01:21:50,108
and sheath your rageful
corpse-hound.

643
01:22:09,001 --> 01:22:11,045
- Rakki.
- Rakki!

644
01:22:11,129 --> 01:22:12,171
What is it, Rakki?

645
01:22:12,255 --> 01:22:13,256
Rakki!

646
01:22:13,756 --> 01:22:15,049
Down, Rakki!

647
01:22:15,341 --> 01:22:17,135
Rakki!

648
01:22:21,973 --> 01:22:24,642
Rakki! Rakki!

649
01:23:04,807 --> 01:23:05,808
Free her.

650
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:18,321
Freyr, it seems,
has chosen for himself

651
01:23:19,071 --> 01:23:21,699
who is deemed fit for sacrifice.

652
01:23:21,824 --> 01:23:24,327
Blighted by his blood...

653
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:26,746
Let us hope
his hunger has been sated.

654
01:23:26,829 --> 01:23:28,748
This is not the work of my God.

655
01:23:31,626 --> 01:23:33,461
This is trollish sorcery.

656
01:23:36,672 --> 01:23:40,968
Tonight, you will be
armed to defend the farm,

657
01:23:41,052 --> 01:23:43,846
for this is also your home.

658
01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:46,349
How can we
trust them to protect us?

659
01:23:46,432 --> 01:23:47,433
Here, dog.

660
01:23:47,517 --> 01:23:49,268
Your father does not want
an uprising

661
01:23:49,352 --> 01:23:50,603
- by emboldened slaves.
- Go!

662
01:23:50,686 --> 01:23:52,438
Do not doubt his wisdom.

663
01:23:52,563 --> 01:23:53,648
Walk!

664
01:24:12,708 --> 01:24:15,211
Black dreams arise.

665
01:24:17,755 --> 01:24:21,467
Hey, slaves, I like your sticks!

666
01:24:23,761 --> 01:24:27,557
Yeah, good luck fending off
the demon with that thing.

667
01:24:31,561 --> 01:24:32,562
Here.

668
01:24:46,284 --> 01:24:47,368
Hungry?

669
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:53,249
Tonight, you are the food!

670
01:25:08,973 --> 01:25:10,349
Go take some night air.

671
01:25:11,225 --> 01:25:12,268
I'll finish here.

672
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:15,521
Go on.

673
01:26:17,583 --> 01:26:19,460
- Get them away!
- Run!

674
01:26:19,543 --> 01:26:21,212
She's a she-devil!

675
01:26:36,852 --> 01:26:37,978
Touch them not.

676
01:26:38,646 --> 01:26:40,523
Look not into their eyes.

677
01:26:41,107 --> 01:26:45,236
The night spirits have entered
their skins and are riding their minds.

678
01:26:48,447 --> 01:26:51,283
Thórir! Out, Dísir!

679
01:26:52,326 --> 01:26:53,452
Begone!

680
01:26:56,497 --> 01:26:58,082
We will meet you before dawn.

681
01:27:51,886 --> 01:27:53,053
Father.

682
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:04,106
Leave me.

683
01:28:43,062 --> 01:28:44,605
Your sword is long.

684
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:46,440
Stop your jest.

685
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:54,198
I am your son.

686
01:28:58,160 --> 01:28:59,203
Amleth?

687
01:29:05,251 --> 01:29:08,504
You live still?

688
01:29:08,796 --> 01:29:10,256
A life of death.

689
01:29:12,716 --> 01:29:15,094
Yet, I swore to survive
till this moment.

690
01:29:16,637 --> 01:29:19,014
Tomorrow, I shall finish
my deeds in honor.

691
01:29:20,933 --> 01:29:22,059
Only then will I discover

692
01:29:22,142 --> 01:29:23,853
whether living is to my liking.

693
01:29:24,770 --> 01:29:26,730
You are your mother's son.

694
01:29:26,814 --> 01:29:28,023
And my father's.

695
01:29:29,525 --> 01:29:31,902
I am come to avenge
King Aurvandil,

696
01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:35,364
to choke my traitorous uncle
in his death-blood

697
01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:38,909
and to free you.

698
01:29:41,787 --> 01:29:44,582
I see you have inherited
your father's simpleness.

699
01:29:47,877 --> 01:29:49,003
What say you?

700
01:29:49,587 --> 01:29:51,422
I never mourned him.

701
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:54,842
You were his queen.

702
01:29:56,093 --> 01:29:59,597
Your father endured me...

703
01:30:01,181 --> 01:30:03,017
because I bore him a son.

704
01:30:05,436 --> 01:30:08,147
No. His affections
were only for silver

705
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:09,815
and rutting his whores.

706
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:12,651
I know not if he had
heart enough to love you.

707
01:30:13,402 --> 01:30:16,363
Silence. He was a coward
feigning to be a king.

708
01:30:16,447 --> 01:30:18,866
He was nothing. He
was just another proud,

709
01:30:18,949 --> 01:30:20,743
lust-stained slaver.

710
01:30:20,826 --> 01:30:22,161
Hold your tongue!

711
01:30:24,163 --> 01:30:26,081
You spit in the face
of your dead husband.

712
01:30:26,165 --> 01:30:27,374
Yet his brother...

713
01:30:29,043 --> 01:30:31,795
...his fine brother.

714
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:39,178
A bastard has no shame
of himself nor his trade.

715
01:30:39,261 --> 01:30:42,598
Your uncle loved me,
though he knew well my past.

716
01:30:47,728 --> 01:30:49,229
Amleth.

717
01:30:51,273 --> 01:30:54,860
Even now, you believe the
fairy tale I told you is true?

718
01:30:55,277 --> 01:30:59,198
"A noble bride hailing
from the land of Brittany"?

719
01:31:00,824 --> 01:31:04,244
I never began as his bride.

720
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:10,376
How easily we all become
princesses again

721
01:31:10,459 --> 01:31:13,462
when the beasts
take us for their wives.

722
01:31:17,299 --> 01:31:18,425
Yes.

723
01:31:19,134 --> 01:31:21,261
You were forced
upon your mother.

724
01:31:21,804 --> 01:31:25,224
Gunnar was received
freely with love.

725
01:31:25,891 --> 01:31:26,976
No.

726
01:31:29,228 --> 01:31:30,854
And know you this.

727
01:31:30,938 --> 01:31:35,234
It was I who begged on my knees

728
01:31:35,317 --> 01:31:38,112
for Fjölnir to kill
King Aurvandil.

729
01:31:39,071 --> 01:31:41,031
I pressed my lips

730
01:31:41,115 --> 01:31:44,493
upon his strong, sweet hand.

731
01:31:45,619 --> 01:31:50,207
I kissed it and I begged.

732
01:31:52,835 --> 01:31:55,462
And so this day
would never come,

733
01:31:56,130 --> 01:31:57,965
Fjölnir ordered your death,

734
01:31:58,048 --> 01:32:00,968
along with your own
mother's blessing.

735
01:32:04,596 --> 01:32:05,931
But I saw it.

736
01:32:08,142 --> 01:32:12,563
I saw Fjölnir carrying
you away... screaming.

737
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:14,273
Screaming?

738
01:32:15,024 --> 01:32:16,567
I was laughing.

739
01:32:16,692 --> 01:32:17,901
Lies!

740
01:32:20,654 --> 01:32:23,115
Now that you are here,
what do we do?

741
01:32:23,824 --> 01:32:27,036
I should kill you
and all that is dear to you.

742
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:28,537
But you love me.

743
01:32:29,038 --> 01:32:33,417
A son loves his mother
and a mother loves her son.

744
01:32:35,794 --> 01:32:39,339
And you saved
your brother's life. You.

745
01:32:40,632 --> 01:32:43,635
You love.

746
01:32:45,888 --> 01:32:49,475
You... love.

747
01:32:52,728 --> 01:32:55,022
None but me knows who you are.

748
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:58,859
And you are so hot for revenge,

749
01:32:59,985 --> 01:33:03,113
child born of savagery.

750
01:33:04,573 --> 01:33:06,158
If you kill Fjölnir...

751
01:33:06,909 --> 01:33:09,870
...if you kill Thórir,

752
01:33:10,454 --> 01:33:15,417
and if you are so untamed
as to kill my Gunnar...

753
01:33:19,088 --> 01:33:21,632
...you would be
my new king, Amleth,

754
01:33:22,633 --> 01:33:27,304
and together we will rule.

755
01:33:38,649 --> 01:33:40,943
Bitch!
Your taste and your mind

756
01:33:41,026 --> 01:33:43,278
reek of your foul father!

757
01:33:43,612 --> 01:33:46,782
You should have joined him in
death! Your words are poison!

758
01:33:46,865 --> 01:33:49,284
I am your death!

759
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:07,594
Die!

760
01:34:26,238 --> 01:34:27,489
Where is your mother?

761
01:34:28,824 --> 01:34:29,908
Tell me.

762
01:34:30,993 --> 01:34:32,244
Where?

763
01:34:33,370 --> 01:34:35,080
She's as evil as Fjölnir.

764
01:34:36,206 --> 01:34:39,293
I will destroy him
and all that she loved.

765
01:34:40,085 --> 01:34:43,297
I will become a hailstorm
of iron and steel.

766
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:45,424
I will have my vengeance.

767
01:34:46,466 --> 01:34:47,467
And more.

768
01:34:48,844 --> 01:34:50,929
Then what must we do now?

769
01:34:54,016 --> 01:34:55,642
I... I...

770
01:34:56,059 --> 01:34:57,311
I must take to the hills.

771
01:34:58,478 --> 01:35:01,356
My mother discovered who
I am. Soon everyone will.

772
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:02,941
I'll go with you.
No.

773
01:35:04,443 --> 01:35:05,986
They cannot know
you are part of this.

774
01:35:06,069 --> 01:35:08,238
Come morning,
they will hunt for me.

775
01:35:08,322 --> 01:35:09,448
Why?

776
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:15,037
You killed her?

777
01:35:15,871 --> 01:35:17,331
I would not kill a woman.

778
01:35:18,123 --> 01:35:19,541
Not even her.

779
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,544
Thórir met his end by my fury.

780
01:35:23,253 --> 01:35:24,922
Well, good riddance.

781
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:29,301
Tomorrow night, you
will return and kill Fjölnir?

782
01:35:30,010 --> 01:35:31,762
If the Norns of Fate allow it.

783
01:35:32,846 --> 01:35:35,724
And whatever happens
tomorrow, be ready to run.

784
01:36:18,225 --> 01:36:19,685
His heart.

785
01:36:20,269 --> 01:36:21,395
His...

786
01:36:22,521 --> 01:36:25,440
His heart.
It's taken his heart!

787
01:36:29,444 --> 01:36:31,488
What evil is this?

788
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:39,538
What evil eats the hearts
of brave young men?

789
01:36:41,248 --> 01:36:44,626
Freyr, do you hear me?

790
01:36:44,710 --> 01:36:45,836
Behave.

791
01:36:46,253 --> 01:36:48,964
Be a man in front
of your inferiors.

792
01:36:49,047 --> 01:36:51,717
There is no evil spirit here.

793
01:36:52,509 --> 01:36:55,512
I told you.
I told you.

794
01:36:55,887 --> 01:36:58,473
It is my cursed son, Amleth.

795
01:36:59,516 --> 01:37:02,102
We rid ourselves of him
as a boy.

796
01:37:02,185 --> 01:37:05,314
You must believe me, he is here.

797
01:37:06,023 --> 01:37:08,692
The progeny of
Aurvandil lives still.

798
01:37:08,775 --> 01:37:12,070
I fear he was led here
by the raven-spirit

799
01:37:12,821 --> 01:37:14,489
of your dead brother.

800
01:37:14,573 --> 01:37:16,450
It's not possible.
Think.

801
01:37:17,075 --> 01:37:18,327
He's killed your men.

802
01:37:18,410 --> 01:37:21,121
He has murdered your eldest son.

803
01:37:21,788 --> 01:37:24,583
And he will not rest till
you lie cold in the ground

804
01:37:24,666 --> 01:37:27,377
and our own Gunnar
lies slain beside you.

805
01:37:28,128 --> 01:37:30,255
It is Amleth.

806
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:35,344
No God can help you
with this task.

807
01:37:36,386 --> 01:37:40,349
You must discover my son and
kill him with your own hands.

808
01:37:41,308 --> 01:37:45,729
Let my words be the whetstone
to your biting rage,

809
01:37:46,229 --> 01:37:49,733
for the mischief of last night
was not the work of one man.

810
01:37:49,816 --> 01:37:52,944
Find the slaves
who ally with him.

811
01:37:54,654 --> 01:37:56,031
Find them!

812
01:37:58,075 --> 01:37:59,618
On your knees!

813
01:37:59,701 --> 01:38:01,661
Down with you!

814
01:38:01,953 --> 01:38:03,538
Down with the lot of you!

815
01:38:11,797 --> 01:38:14,424
I know not, nor care not,

816
01:38:15,050 --> 01:38:17,677
if that slave aided
in the death of my son,

817
01:38:19,638 --> 01:38:21,390
but this is the end
you will all meet

818
01:38:21,473 --> 01:38:23,725
if you speak not what you know.

819
01:38:26,019 --> 01:38:27,020
No?

820
01:38:34,069 --> 01:38:36,905
I see you're no longer afraid
of a woman's blood.

821
01:38:37,531 --> 01:38:38,532
You.

822
01:38:38,615 --> 01:38:40,700
Of course, it is you.

823
01:38:41,284 --> 01:38:42,327
Fjölnir!

824
01:38:43,245 --> 01:38:44,496
Let her alone!

825
01:38:45,247 --> 01:38:48,583
I offer you your son's heart
in exchange for her life!

826
01:38:56,925 --> 01:38:59,511
I am Amleth the Bear-Wolf,

827
01:38:59,594 --> 01:39:02,973
son of King Aurvandil War-Raven,

828
01:39:03,056 --> 01:39:07,936
and I am his vengeance!

829
01:39:08,061 --> 01:39:09,396
Kill him!

830
01:39:09,479 --> 01:39:11,106
Bring him to me!

831
01:39:11,189 --> 01:39:14,776
- Kill him!
- He's mine!

832
01:40:34,272 --> 01:40:35,482
In the end,

833
01:40:37,275 --> 01:40:39,694
you're just like your father.

834
01:40:41,696 --> 01:40:44,741
Evil begets evil.

835
01:40:49,037 --> 01:40:51,998
How do you know
it's your son's heart

836
01:40:53,583 --> 01:40:55,210
and not the heart of a rabid dog

837
01:40:55,293 --> 01:40:56,920
killed two nights ago?

838
01:41:02,509 --> 01:41:03,969
Where is it?

839
01:41:10,433 --> 01:41:12,185
You cannot kill me.

840
01:41:13,895 --> 01:41:16,648
Even if you were to
strike me with your sword,

841
01:41:17,315 --> 01:41:18,942
it would not bite.

842
01:41:20,902 --> 01:41:22,529
It is not my time.

843
01:41:23,822 --> 01:41:25,740
I will die in battle.

844
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,411
Where is my son's heart?

845
01:41:35,709 --> 01:41:37,627
Ódinn the All. Father

846
01:41:38,587 --> 01:41:41,089
will vanquish
your God of erections.

847
01:41:42,549 --> 01:41:43,633
Fear him.

848
01:41:43,717 --> 01:41:44,968
Silence!

849
01:41:46,886 --> 01:41:49,306
I will come back for your heart.

850
01:41:49,973 --> 01:41:52,892
And your mother and I
will eat it.

851
01:43:03,546 --> 01:43:07,801
Ódinn, let the Valkyrja,
your warrior maiden,

852
01:43:07,884 --> 01:43:11,930
fly me to your shining gates.

853
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:23,233
I see my father and mother.

854
01:43:26,736 --> 01:43:28,613
I see my dead kindred.

855
01:43:33,076 --> 01:43:35,912
I see my master
in Freyja's hall.

856
01:43:36,871 --> 01:43:38,581
He calls me to him.

857
01:44:51,946 --> 01:44:54,824
Tonight, our mourning
for Thórir ends.

858
01:45:10,298 --> 01:45:13,635
May the neck-ale
of this swift steed

859
01:45:14,344 --> 01:45:16,638
hasten you to the highest tree

860
01:45:16,721 --> 01:45:19,015
of the battle-weavers, brother.

861
01:45:54,759 --> 01:45:57,804
My hour of grief

862
01:45:58,847 --> 01:46:00,265
has passed.

863
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:06,813
The time of
wrath-kindled revenge

864
01:46:06,896 --> 01:46:08,982
is upon us!

865
01:47:55,296 --> 01:47:56,798
This is not Valhöll?

866
01:47:57,632 --> 01:47:59,550
I did not carry you that far.

867
01:48:03,638 --> 01:48:05,264
I am no Valkyrja.

868
01:48:05,932 --> 01:48:08,810
The dreams of your
afterlife must wait.

869
01:48:10,645 --> 01:48:11,729
Besides...

870
01:48:12,522 --> 01:48:13,982
I'm not done with you yet.

871
01:48:34,293 --> 01:48:35,753
My fate brought me to Iceland

872
01:48:35,837 --> 01:48:37,922
to carry out my pledge
of vengeance.

873
01:48:40,550 --> 01:48:42,135
But my fate

874
01:48:44,554 --> 01:48:46,973
did not ready me
for finding you.

875
01:48:49,642 --> 01:48:52,478
I thought I must always
shield my heart in stone.

876
01:48:53,563 --> 01:48:56,524
I could not think I would
open it to a Northman.

877
01:48:59,402 --> 01:49:01,946
You sacrificed yourself
that I could flee.

878
01:49:03,364 --> 01:49:04,991
And you came back for me.

879
01:49:14,375 --> 01:49:17,170
I have never felt close
to another person.

880
01:49:20,798 --> 01:49:22,341
Not since I was a child.

881
01:49:24,343 --> 01:49:26,429
I curse your mother's evil.

882
01:49:29,515 --> 01:49:31,267
She murdered my past.

883
01:49:33,227 --> 01:49:35,313
Could it not be
that your Norns of Fate

884
01:49:35,396 --> 01:49:37,648
have spun another thread
for you to follow?

885
01:49:41,069 --> 01:49:42,820
What do your Earth Gods
tell you?

886
01:49:45,364 --> 01:49:47,950
That wherever I go,
I must take you with me.

887
01:49:54,874 --> 01:49:56,501
I have kinsmen in Orkney.

888
01:49:57,794 --> 01:50:00,838
We could find... we could
find safe passage there.

889
01:50:02,006 --> 01:50:03,091
Together.

890
01:50:06,677 --> 01:50:08,179
Yet, I cannot truly believe

891
01:50:08,262 --> 01:50:10,807
that you have extinguished
your fire for vengeance.

892
01:50:14,435 --> 01:50:16,562
Hate is all I have ever known.

893
01:50:18,689 --> 01:50:20,399
But I wish
I could be free of it.

894
01:50:21,359 --> 01:50:23,277
That is for you to choose.

895
01:50:25,780 --> 01:50:27,698
Let us find our future.

896
01:50:58,062 --> 01:50:59,730
Welcome, seafarers.

897
01:51:00,273 --> 01:51:02,066
The deck of this wooden
saddle-beast

898
01:51:02,150 --> 01:51:04,735
will be the only ground
you tread for 21 days.

899
01:51:11,284 --> 01:51:14,036
I was expecting more of
Fjölnir's men.

900
01:51:14,871 --> 01:51:16,414
His son was to join us.

901
01:51:29,719 --> 01:51:31,012
Anchor up!

902
01:51:31,554 --> 01:51:32,972
Sail down!

903
01:51:36,350 --> 01:51:37,852
Secure the shrouds!

904
01:51:37,935 --> 01:51:39,020
Shrouds secured!

905
01:51:41,814 --> 01:51:43,649
Keep her downwind, helmsman.

906
01:51:43,733 --> 01:51:44,775
Aye, aye!

907
01:51:46,527 --> 01:51:47,695
Your wound.

908
01:51:50,281 --> 01:51:52,533
It is nothing
to what we have endured.

909
01:51:53,492 --> 01:51:54,911
I have forgotten it already.

910
01:52:25,942 --> 01:52:27,568
My family's blood.

911
01:52:30,488 --> 01:52:32,365
My own blood is inside you.

912
01:52:35,451 --> 01:52:38,037
You are the well
our dynasty will spring from.

913
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:40,373
I did not wish you to know

914
01:52:40,456 --> 01:52:43,042
until I could trust
that our child would be safe.

915
01:52:48,923 --> 01:52:51,717
While Fjölnir lives, our
children will never be safe.

916
01:52:53,844 --> 01:52:55,388
If he but knew of this,

917
01:52:55,471 --> 01:52:57,932
he would hunt you
with all the fire of the Gods.

918
01:52:59,308 --> 01:53:00,309
It cannot wait.

919
01:53:00,393 --> 01:53:01,602
Stop this.

920
01:53:02,603 --> 01:53:05,606
There is now a living thread
that binds us.

921
01:53:06,023 --> 01:53:07,525
I was a fool.

922
01:53:10,027 --> 01:53:12,363
I wished to flee with you
from my fate.

923
01:53:26,460 --> 01:53:28,629
My vision shows me
you will have two.

924
01:53:31,257 --> 01:53:33,259
And my sword will save them.

925
01:53:42,143 --> 01:53:43,728
But you must come with us.

926
01:53:44,353 --> 01:53:45,354
You must!

927
01:53:46,814 --> 01:53:48,941
It was prophesied
that I must choose

928
01:53:50,067 --> 01:53:54,530
between kindness for my kin
and hate for my enemies.

929
01:53:54,947 --> 01:53:57,408
And see what hope
we have before us.

930
01:54:06,792 --> 01:54:08,085
I choose both.

931
01:54:16,344 --> 01:54:17,678
Take her to Orkney.

932
01:54:18,012 --> 01:54:21,015
In return for this ring, my kinsmen
will give you ninefold its worth.

933
01:54:21,098 --> 01:54:22,475
No! No!

934
01:54:22,558 --> 01:54:23,684
Amleth!

935
01:54:28,230 --> 01:54:30,358
You will be mother to a king!

936
01:54:31,692 --> 01:54:33,110
We cannot escape our fate.

937
01:54:33,652 --> 01:54:34,820
No!

938
01:54:35,946 --> 01:54:39,158
Amleth!

939
01:56:18,966 --> 01:56:20,092
It's the slave!

940
01:56:23,762 --> 01:56:24,763
It's him!

941
01:56:30,144 --> 01:56:31,228
Close off the house!

942
01:56:47,828 --> 01:56:50,289
The cub you once hunted
ate off your nose.

943
01:56:51,123 --> 01:56:52,958
Now, the wolf is grown.

944
01:56:54,126 --> 01:56:55,419
He hungers for the rest.

945
01:57:03,010 --> 01:57:06,347
Whatever you hear,
you must stay hidden.

946
01:57:09,850 --> 01:57:10,851
Keep him safe.

947
01:57:13,103 --> 01:57:14,980
Keep both of you safe.

948
01:57:15,064 --> 01:57:16,065
I will.

949
01:57:45,261 --> 01:57:46,428
Take your freedom

950
01:57:48,138 --> 01:57:49,598
and do with it what you will.

951
01:58:01,777 --> 01:58:02,778
Fjölnir!

952
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,626
Never!

953
01:58:30,806 --> 01:58:32,474
In the heart.

954
01:58:36,061 --> 01:58:37,187
Thank you.

955
01:58:46,322 --> 01:58:47,573
Mother!

956
02:00:06,735 --> 02:00:09,321
I will meet you
at the Gates of Hel.

957
02:00:11,740 --> 02:00:12,991
At the Gates of Hel,

958
02:00:14,618 --> 02:00:15,619
you will find me.

959
02:00:17,246 --> 02:00:18,539
And there you will die

960
02:00:20,666 --> 02:00:23,293
by the hand
that killed your father.

961
02:00:44,314 --> 02:00:45,399
Let me down!

962
02:02:33,298 --> 02:02:34,591
Slain by iron,

963
02:02:36,009 --> 02:02:38,971
we shall all meet again in
the stronghold of the All-Father.

964
02:03:57,257 --> 02:03:58,675
My blood will live on!

965
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:01,345
Valhöll awaits!

966
02:07:39,938 --> 02:07:43,358
<i>The thread that binds us
can never break.</i>

967
02:07:49,656 --> 02:07:50,782
<i>We are safe.</i>

968
02:07:59,583 --> 02:08:01,751
<i>Now make your passage.</i>
