1
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:57,338
Happy birthday, thank you.

2
00:05:59,588 --> 00:05:59,963
Happy birthday.

3
00:06:00,046 --> 00:06:00,838
Oh, thank you.

4
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:02,255
Happy birthday.

5
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:03,296
Thank you.

6
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:26,755
I don't care if every fucking young girl

7
00:06:26,838 --> 00:06:27,880
in this fucking town

8
00:06:27,963 --> 00:06:29,505
in the next few weeks.

9
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:32,463
Look, I made it simple.

10
00:06:33,213 --> 00:06:34,671
We need her young.

11
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:36,713
We need her hot.

12
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:38,380
We need her now.

13
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:41,713
How the old bitch has been able to stick

14
00:06:41,796 --> 00:06:42,921
around for this long.

15
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:45,630
That's the fucking mystery to me.

16
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:48,463
Oh, Oscar winner, my ass.

17
00:06:49,296 --> 00:06:50,838
When was that back in the 30s?

18
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:52,713
What, for King Kong?

19
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:58,380
No, I don't give a

20
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:00,671
fuck what we promised her.

21
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,713
This is network TV,

22
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:04,171
not a fucking charity.

23
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:07,380
Find me somebody new.

24
00:07:08,505 --> 00:07:08,796
Now.

25
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:13,005
Hey, did you know that a woman's

26
00:07:13,088 --> 00:07:14,088
fertility starts to

27
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:15,796
decrease by the age of 25?

28
00:07:16,838 --> 00:07:17,380
How old is Jennifer?

29
00:07:18,421 --> 00:07:19,880
You better get busy.

30
00:07:57,463 --> 00:07:58,463
It's like when you see

31
00:07:58,546 --> 00:08:00,046
someone fart on screen.

32
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,963
People just love that.

33
00:08:06,046 --> 00:08:10,338
I mean, that's just the way it is.

34
00:08:10,796 --> 00:08:11,505
So you know what I mean?

35
00:08:12,046 --> 00:08:13,296
People are just people.

36
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:17,380
And I have to give people what they want.

37
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,213
That's what keeps the shareholders happy.

38
00:08:19,796 --> 00:08:23,213
And people always ask for something new.

39
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,630
Renewal is inevitable.

40
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:33,005
And at 50, well, it stops.

41
00:08:34,005 --> 00:08:35,255
What stops?

42
00:08:36,421 --> 00:08:36,588
What?

43
00:08:38,296 --> 00:08:38,880
What stops?

44
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:44,588
Um, you know, the um...

45
00:08:47,546 --> 00:08:48,296
The um...

46
00:08:49,546 --> 00:08:52,213
The um...

47
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:53,088
Oh, George!

48
00:08:54,255 --> 00:08:55,338
Oh, oh!

49
00:08:55,671 --> 00:08:56,713
I'm sorry, I gotta run.

50
00:08:57,088 --> 00:08:57,296
Harvey!

51
00:08:58,213 --> 00:08:58,255
SCREAMS

52
00:08:58,296 --> 00:09:00,755
George, those ratings are insane!

53
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:03,421
You're a genius!

54
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,588
Oh, what a mess. You're a genius.

55
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,171
That's why you'd be drinking.

56
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:09,505
Oh, that's hilarious.

57
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:00,963
Well, it's your lucky day, Miss Sparkle,

58
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:01,755
because we have

59
00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:03,171
X-rayed you from head to toe,

60
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:03,963
and you don't have so

61
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:04,963
much as a crap molar.

62
00:10:05,046 --> 00:10:07,713
So, you are good to go.

63
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:11,005
Uh, vaccination, okay?

64
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,755
Not going on a vacation.

65
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:15,421
By the way, I just want to

66
00:10:15,505 --> 00:10:18,088
say, my wife is a huge fan.

67
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,130
Um, blood type...

68
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,130
Oh, hey, it's your birthday.

69
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:26,380
Happy birthday.

70
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,671
Oh, uh, that's an emergency, I'm sorry.

71
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:40,796
I, uh, had to have a...

72
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:42,588
Bye.

73
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,213
One moment.

74
00:10:53,046 --> 00:10:54,921
It's just one last exam to perform.

75
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,046
I thought he said I was good to go.

76
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:19,796
Is there a problem?

77
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:21,005
No, it's perfect.

78
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,755
You're a good candidate.

79
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:25,338
I mean, are you good to go?

80
00:11:30,005 --> 00:11:30,880
I wish you the best.

81
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:09,546
Lizzie?

82
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:12,713
Lizzie Sparkle?

83
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:15,338
Oh my God, I can't believe it.

84
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:18,130
Fred!

85
00:12:19,963 --> 00:12:21,755
Fred, from 10th grade homeroom!

86
00:12:24,005 --> 00:12:26,838
Oh, Fred, of course.

87
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:28,546
You haven't changed a bit.

88
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:31,963
You're still the most beautiful girl in

89
00:12:32,046 --> 00:12:33,005
the whole wide world.

90
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:34,963
You know, I followed your career.

91
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:35,838
What a success.

92
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,588
I mean, wow, wow, wow.

93
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:39,880
Wow.

94
00:12:40,796 --> 00:12:43,588
Hey, why don't we go out maybe for a

95
00:12:43,671 --> 00:12:44,546
drink sometime now that

96
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,546
we're, you know, reconnected?

97
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:46,963
Um...

98
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,921
Oh, of course, I'm stupid.

99
00:12:50,005 --> 00:12:50,755
You're super busy.

100
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:51,296
But you know what?

101
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:53,713
Why don't you give me your card?

102
00:12:54,046 --> 00:12:55,171
I mean, you never help.

103
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,880
Um, sure, what I...

104
00:12:58,005 --> 00:12:58,463
This will do.

105
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,088
Oh.

106
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,005
Don't look at my cholesterol levels.

107
00:13:01,255 --> 00:13:01,963
They're a disaster.

108
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:06,338
Oh, God.

109
00:13:06,588 --> 00:13:06,963
What is that?

110
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:10,713
There.

111
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:14,671
Now you've got it.

112
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:09,463
Have you ever dreamt of a

113
00:14:09,546 --> 00:14:11,005
better version of yourself?

114
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:14,796
Younger.

115
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:16,671
More beautiful.

116
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:18,713
More perfect.

117
00:14:20,213 --> 00:14:23,380
One single injection unlocks your DNA,

118
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,630
starting a new cellular

119
00:14:25,713 --> 00:14:26,963
division that will release

120
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:29,213
another version of yourself.

121
00:14:30,213 --> 00:14:33,255
This is the substance.

122
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,005
You are the matrix.

123
00:14:36,671 --> 00:14:38,213
Everything comes from you.

124
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:40,921
And everything is you.

125
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,171
This is simply a

126
00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:44,505
better version of yourself.

127
00:14:45,463 --> 00:14:46,463
You just have to share.

128
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,380
One week for one and

129
00:14:49,463 --> 00:14:50,630
one week for the other.

130
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,838
A perfect balance of seven days each.

131
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:55,963
The one and only thing not to forget.

132
00:14:56,046 --> 00:14:59,005
You are one.

133
00:14:59,713 --> 00:15:01,338
You can't escape from yourself.

134
00:17:25,005 --> 00:17:25,671
Yes.

135
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:27,005
Hello.

136
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:32,088
I'd like to order.

137
00:17:35,005 --> 00:17:35,296
Address.

138
00:17:38,005 --> 00:17:39,588
1057 Beverly Canyon.

139
00:17:42,088 --> 00:17:42,796
Write this down.

140
00:17:43,255 --> 00:17:44,921
35 North Byron Alley.

141
00:17:46,088 --> 00:17:47,755
35 North.

142
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,880
You are the matrix.

143
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,046
Everything comes from

144
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,213
you, and everything is you.

145
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,880
This is simply a

146
00:23:53,963 --> 00:23:55,130
better version of yourself.

147
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:13,838
Hello.

148
00:36:57,463 --> 00:36:57,588
Thanks.

149
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,796
We'll let you know by next week.

150
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,588
Thank you so much.

151
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:02,338
I'm just dying to get the part.

152
00:37:08,796 --> 00:37:09,255
Great dancer.

153
00:37:10,463 --> 00:37:11,463
Hmm, too bad her

154
00:37:11,546 --> 00:37:12,630
boobs aren't in the middle

155
00:37:12,713 --> 00:37:14,005
of her instead of the nose.

156
00:37:17,588 --> 00:37:17,796
Next!

157
00:37:32,505 --> 00:37:34,130
Looks like everything sure is in the

158
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:35,630
right place this time.

159
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:38,713
Please say your name, age, measurements.

160
00:37:54,088 --> 00:37:55,505
I'm Sue.

161
00:38:00,255 --> 00:38:01,380
I'm Sue.

162
00:38:03,046 --> 00:38:07,005
Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue.

163
00:38:11,963 --> 00:38:14,463
Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue, Sue.

164
00:38:14,546 --> 00:38:15,713
Where is she?

165
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:17,838
Where is she?

166
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:35,255
What a gorgeous little angel.

167
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,546
You're hired.

168
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:51,963
We want a show that's just like you.

169
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:53,546
Beautiful and happy.

170
00:38:54,005 --> 00:38:55,505
People want to be happy.

171
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:58,255
We air in two weeks,

172
00:38:58,338 --> 00:38:59,463
so let's get to work.

173
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:00,421
I'm gonna let you organize

174
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:01,755
the rest with my assistant.

175
00:39:06,338 --> 00:39:06,671
Isabella?

176
00:39:08,796 --> 00:39:10,338
Is-is-isis.

177
00:39:10,421 --> 00:39:11,463
Who has time to say that?

178
00:39:12,463 --> 00:39:13,338
We're gonna make you Cindy.

179
00:39:14,046 --> 00:39:15,755
It's shorter, it's better.

180
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:18,171
So, I'm gonna let you

181
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:19,755
organize everything else with Cindy.

182
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:23,088
Oh, um, before you go,

183
00:39:23,505 --> 00:39:24,546
I just have to mention

184
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:27,171
a small scheduling issue.

185
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:32,130
I have to be out of town every other week

186
00:39:32,213 --> 00:39:34,588
to take care of my

187
00:39:34,671 --> 00:39:37,213
mother, who's very sick.

188
00:39:45,713 --> 00:39:48,213
I want you for this

189
00:39:48,296 --> 00:39:50,046
show, and we will work around

190
00:39:50,213 --> 00:39:53,088
any mother, brother, fucking sick,

191
00:39:53,505 --> 00:39:55,421
puppy you need to take care of.

192
00:39:56,005 --> 00:39:56,213
Hmm?

193
00:39:57,338 --> 00:39:57,505
Hmm.

194
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,463
Gorgeous, with a pure heart.

195
00:40:04,296 --> 00:40:06,046
People are gonna love that.

196
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,213
Perfect.

197
00:41:02,213 --> 00:41:06,296
So you jump out, touch your elbows,

198
00:41:07,255 --> 00:41:10,088
head down, contract.

199
00:41:13,713 --> 00:41:16,671
And five, six, seven, eight, elbows.

200
00:44:48,921 --> 00:44:53,505
Where have you been?

201
00:44:54,796 --> 00:44:55,421
I've all been wanting

202
00:44:55,505 --> 00:44:56,671
to have a drink with you

203
00:44:56,755 --> 00:44:57,713
for your departure.

204
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:02,213
Anyway, we all chipped in

205
00:45:02,296 --> 00:45:05,463
and we got you just a little

206
00:45:05,546 --> 00:45:07,088
something to keep you busy.

207
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,171
It's French.

208
00:45:09,713 --> 00:45:11,463
My wife, she's for her spire.

209
00:45:11,546 --> 00:45:12,463
Oh, I don't want my wife.

210
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,546
Oops, I gotta run.

211
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:19,505
But it's always great to see you.

212
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:49,088
The antelope and the deer moving about

213
00:46:50,421 --> 00:46:51,505
are going through the text.

214
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:45,838
The antelope with remotes.

215
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,546
I cannot believe the

216
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:50,171
incredible price for $49.98.

217
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:36,088
God dammit, they have the phone

218
00:49:36,296 --> 00:49:38,130
and it's such a great night.

219
00:49:38,755 --> 00:49:39,380
Open up.

220
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:43,005
We gotta open up.

221
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,755
And uh, sorry.

222
00:49:48,213 --> 00:49:49,255
I thought that Ms. Sparkle.

223
00:49:49,671 --> 00:49:50,338
She moved out.

224
00:49:50,963 --> 00:49:51,630
I'm the new tenant.

225
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:54,088
Sue.

226
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:56,338
Oliver.

227
00:49:57,088 --> 00:49:57,588
Oliver.

228
00:49:59,630 --> 00:49:59,880
Oliver.

229
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:02,088
You wanted to complain about something?

230
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:03,755
Oliver?

231
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:05,588
What?

232
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:06,921
No.

233
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,630
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

234
00:50:10,171 --> 00:50:11,088
I think it's like

235
00:50:11,171 --> 00:50:12,380
awesome when there's stuff

236
00:50:12,463 --> 00:50:12,963
going on in the

237
00:50:13,046 --> 00:50:13,963
building, you know what I mean?

238
00:50:16,296 --> 00:50:18,213
Um, I'm actually,

239
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,921
quite handy if you ever need,

240
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:26,005
need me to be of aid in any way.

241
00:50:26,921 --> 00:50:28,088
I got a sack of tools

242
00:50:28,171 --> 00:50:30,880
and I got a big hammer.

243
00:50:34,171 --> 00:50:34,963
You know what I mean.

244
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,963
Anyways, I live right here,

245
00:50:40,046 --> 00:50:41,713
so you know where to find me.

246
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:42,296
Anytime.

247
00:50:43,713 --> 00:50:44,505
Day or night.

248
00:50:45,505 --> 00:50:45,755
Later.

249
00:52:41,505 --> 00:52:42,088
Hi everybody.

250
00:52:43,005 --> 00:52:46,588
I'm Sue and it's time to pump it up.

251
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:47,421
Are you ready?

252
00:52:48,171 --> 00:52:48,671
Let's go.

253
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:19,546
Thank you so much everybody.

254
00:54:20,921 --> 00:54:21,838
I'll see you next week.

255
00:54:24,713 --> 00:54:26,505
And in the meantime,

256
00:54:27,463 --> 00:54:29,380
take care of yourself.

257
00:54:36,463 --> 00:54:36,921
courtesy!

258
00:54:39,505 --> 00:54:44,171
Wonderful, wonderful.

259
00:56:02,838 --> 00:56:05,963
I won't be out late, so just wait for me.

260
00:56:12,171 --> 00:56:13,088
Don't eat too fast.

261
00:58:23,588 --> 00:58:27,088
Are you all right?

262
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:32,796
Yes, I'll be right back.

263
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:10,755
Are you all right?

264
00:59:53,963 --> 00:59:57,755
What did you do?

265
00:59:58,380 --> 00:59:59,213
You've seen me the more

266
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:00,421
beautiful than before.

267
01:00:40,213 --> 01:00:40,838
No.

268
01:02:34,921 --> 01:02:35,130
Yes.

269
01:02:36,463 --> 01:02:37,296
Yes, hi.

270
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:39,713
This is Elizabeth Sparkle.

271
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:46,963
I'm 503.

272
01:02:48,755 --> 01:02:48,963
Yes.

273
01:02:50,671 --> 01:02:51,671
Yes, hi.

274
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,380
There's been a slight

275
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:56,588
misuse of the substance.

276
01:02:57,338 --> 01:03:03,046
A few extra hours were accidentally used

277
01:03:03,963 --> 01:03:05,463
causing an alteration.

278
01:03:09,171 --> 01:03:09,880
So I'm just looking for

279
01:03:09,963 --> 01:03:11,171
the procedure to reverse it.

280
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:13,005
What has been used on one

281
01:03:13,088 --> 01:03:15,296
side is lost on the other side.

282
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:16,796
There's no going back.

283
01:03:23,255 --> 01:03:26,755
No, I don't know what she was thinking.

284
01:03:27,338 --> 01:03:29,463
And obviously she was drunk.

285
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,130
Remember there is no she and you.

286
01:03:32,505 --> 01:03:33,338
You are one.

287
01:03:34,463 --> 01:03:35,005
Respect the balance

288
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:36,088
and you won't have

289
01:03:36,171 --> 01:03:37,380
any more inconveniences.

290
01:05:16,296 --> 01:05:16,505
Sue!

291
01:05:18,005 --> 01:05:18,171
Sue?

292
01:05:19,755 --> 01:05:21,005
I just saw you on TV.

293
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:23,255
Holy moly.

294
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:26,713
Makes me want to join your class.

295
01:05:27,463 --> 01:05:27,880
Hey, you don't give

296
01:05:27,963 --> 01:05:29,005
private lessons, do you?

297
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:34,546
Hey, what about a

298
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,671
drink at my place tonight?

299
01:05:38,838 --> 01:05:39,963
Come on, don't be shy.

300
01:05:40,838 --> 01:05:42,088
I see you standing behind

301
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:43,630
the door there, gorgeous.

302
01:05:47,005 --> 01:05:48,463
All right, take your

303
01:05:48,546 --> 01:05:50,421
time, but it's a date.

304
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:37,296
Sue.

305
01:07:23,671 --> 01:07:24,421
What can I get you?

306
01:07:28,921 --> 01:07:30,005
Moka Latte.

307
01:07:39,046 --> 01:07:40,921
It's long, isn't it?

308
01:07:43,213 --> 01:07:43,963
Excuse me?

309
01:07:48,213 --> 01:07:49,338
Seven days.

310
01:08:17,546 --> 01:08:21,380
Did you follow me here?

311
01:08:22,588 --> 01:08:25,546
I was just curious to find out

312
01:08:25,630 --> 01:08:27,463
how things were going for you.

313
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:30,130
Each time you feel a little

314
01:08:30,213 --> 01:08:34,505
more lonely, don't you think?

315
01:08:36,505 --> 01:08:37,880
I don't know what you were talking about.

316
01:08:40,463 --> 01:08:40,838
I'm fine.

317
01:08:42,921 --> 01:08:43,671
Everything's fine.

318
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:47,671
It gets harder each time to remember

319
01:08:47,755 --> 01:08:51,463
that you still deserve to exist.

320
01:08:55,046 --> 01:08:55,921
That this part of

321
01:08:56,005 --> 01:08:59,380
yourself is still worth something

322
01:08:59,463 --> 01:09:03,838
that you still matter.

323
01:09:08,546 --> 01:09:10,505
Has she started yet?

324
01:09:12,171 --> 01:09:14,421
Eating away at you?

325
01:09:32,463 --> 01:09:32,671
Fuck!

326
01:09:33,296 --> 01:09:33,921
Watch out!

327
01:09:43,255 --> 01:09:43,421
What?

328
01:09:54,921 --> 01:09:55,130
Hey!

329
01:09:55,921 --> 01:09:56,255
Move!

330
01:10:27,796 --> 01:10:29,213
You're still the most beautiful girl

331
01:10:29,296 --> 01:10:30,671
in the whole wide world.

332
01:10:41,005 --> 01:10:41,088
Hello?

333
01:10:42,255 --> 01:10:43,088
Hi, Fred.

334
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,630
It's Lizzie.

335
01:10:48,296 --> 01:10:48,546
Hello?

336
01:10:49,963 --> 01:10:51,171
Sorry, I mean, I'm a chalk.

337
01:10:52,463 --> 01:10:52,588
Oh.

338
01:10:52,963 --> 01:10:53,255
Wow.

339
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:54,671
Wow, wow.

340
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:56,546
I thought I'd never

341
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:57,671
hear from you again after--

342
01:10:57,755 --> 01:10:59,671
Oh gosh, no, no, not at all.

343
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,796
I just, I've just

344
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,921
been really busy lately.

345
01:11:03,796 --> 01:11:07,088
So listen, I was thinking that

346
01:11:09,296 --> 01:11:10,213
maybe we could get

347
01:11:10,296 --> 01:11:12,005
together and grab a drink.

348
01:11:18,005 --> 01:11:18,588
Are you still there?

349
01:11:20,005 --> 01:11:21,463
Sorry, I'm in shock.

350
01:11:21,546 --> 01:11:22,046
I'm in shock again.

351
01:11:23,546 --> 01:11:27,505
I could book Luigi's at eight.

352
01:11:28,838 --> 01:11:29,880
Eight in Luigi's?

353
01:11:30,130 --> 01:11:30,463
It is.

354
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:34,088
I will see you tonight.

355
01:11:35,713 --> 01:11:35,921
Bye.

356
01:11:36,546 --> 01:11:37,880
Okay, bye.

357
01:16:42,505 --> 01:16:43,338
Hi everybody.

358
01:16:43,796 --> 01:16:44,046
Hi.

359
01:16:45,088 --> 01:16:46,296
Okay, here we go everyone.

360
01:16:46,546 --> 01:16:47,296
Clear the set please.

361
01:16:47,671 --> 01:16:49,046
First positions, thank you.

362
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:49,921
Roll cameras.

363
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,171
And in three, two, one.

364
01:16:57,838 --> 01:16:59,880
Squat, squat, squat.

365
01:17:01,546 --> 01:17:02,421
Circle those hips.

366
01:17:03,588 --> 01:17:04,255
Circle those hips.

367
01:17:05,546 --> 01:17:07,505
Contract, contract, contract,

368
01:17:08,046 --> 01:17:10,213
contract, contract, contract.

369
01:17:10,588 --> 01:17:12,296
Contract, between your legs.

370
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:19,046
Cut.

371
01:17:23,796 --> 01:17:27,921
I'm sorry, I thought I, thought I, I,

372
01:17:29,171 --> 01:17:29,838
I just got distracted.

373
01:17:31,505 --> 01:17:32,171
Not a problem, let's

374
01:17:32,255 --> 01:17:33,005
get right back to it.

375
01:17:33,505 --> 01:17:34,255
Back to one please.

376
01:17:37,713 --> 01:17:39,046
Sorry, it's the control room now.

377
01:17:39,505 --> 01:17:40,546
The director said he saw something

378
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:41,713
bizarre on the monitor.

379
01:17:42,005 --> 01:17:43,255
Bring up the replay on camera two.

380
01:17:43,671 --> 01:17:44,171
Camera two.

381
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:56,130
Forward.

382
01:18:03,130 --> 01:18:04,213
Can I have my dressing gown?

383
01:18:04,505 --> 01:18:05,421
Sorry, it's in your dressing room.

384
01:18:05,505 --> 01:18:06,421
But I go and get it.

385
01:18:07,546 --> 01:18:08,588
Let's just take this frame by frame.

386
01:18:20,755 --> 01:18:24,630
I need five minutes.

387
01:20:23,546 --> 01:20:23,796
Yes.

388
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,380
This balance is not working.

389
01:20:25,963 --> 01:20:28,046
I barely have any time to enjoy myself

390
01:20:28,255 --> 01:20:31,005
while she wastes seven days

391
01:20:31,171 --> 01:20:32,630
stuffing her face in front of the TV.

392
01:20:32,963 --> 01:20:34,921
Remember there is no she and you.

393
01:20:38,296 --> 01:20:40,171
I love everybody.

394
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:45,713
What's happening?

395
01:20:45,921 --> 01:20:46,380
Where is everybody?

396
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:47,880
The TV's been canceled.

397
01:20:49,796 --> 01:20:50,463
What, why?

398
01:20:50,546 --> 01:20:50,755
Sue.

399
01:20:52,213 --> 01:20:52,880
Harvey wants to see you

400
01:20:52,963 --> 01:20:53,588
in his office immediately.

401
01:20:55,255 --> 01:20:55,505
Okay.

402
01:20:56,796 --> 01:20:57,505
I'll go change him.

403
01:20:57,588 --> 01:20:58,713
No, he said now.

404
01:21:16,921 --> 01:21:17,838
I'll get right to the bond.

405
01:21:19,505 --> 01:21:21,088
We can't keep you on the morning show.

406
01:21:22,838 --> 01:21:23,380
But why?

407
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:24,796
I just started.

408
01:21:26,046 --> 01:21:27,588
Ratings are through the roof.

409
01:21:28,838 --> 01:21:30,338
We started at 42.

410
01:21:31,505 --> 01:21:32,671
Now we're up to like--

411
01:21:33,838 --> 01:21:34,213
216.

412
01:21:35,046 --> 01:21:36,213
It's phenomenal.

413
01:21:36,588 --> 01:21:39,921
People love you.

414
01:21:40,505 --> 01:21:41,796
They adore you.

415
01:21:42,213 --> 01:21:44,963
They want more and more and more of you.

416
01:21:45,630 --> 01:21:46,463
That is why we have

417
01:21:46,546 --> 01:21:48,588
decided that we want you

418
01:21:48,671 --> 01:21:52,713
to host the New Year's Eve show.

419
01:21:53,796 --> 01:21:54,963
You mean the--

420
01:21:55,046 --> 01:21:56,588
The network's biggest show.

421
01:21:57,088 --> 01:21:58,921
50 million viewers live.

422
01:21:59,421 --> 01:22:01,421
You can't go higher than that.

423
01:22:03,921 --> 01:22:04,588
That's gonna be intense.

424
01:22:04,671 --> 01:22:09,838
We only have a few more. So are you in?

425
01:22:19,796 --> 01:22:22,005
If you don't open the

426
01:22:22,088 --> 01:22:23,338
door and opportunity knocks,

427
01:22:23,421 --> 01:22:24,255
you won't get another chance.

428
01:22:26,338 --> 01:22:27,713
You of all people know this.

429
01:22:40,921 --> 01:22:41,880
Just one more day and

430
01:22:41,963 --> 01:22:43,005
then I have a whole week off.

431
01:22:43,255 --> 01:22:43,713
We can switch.

432
01:23:02,088 --> 01:23:03,380
We're doing the cover of Vogue.

433
01:23:05,296 --> 01:23:06,171
Just one more day, okay?

434
01:23:57,421 --> 01:24:17,796
Yes. She didn't respect the balance.

435
01:24:18,421 --> 01:24:19,588
She's stealing more

436
01:24:19,671 --> 01:24:20,921
and more time from me,

437
01:24:21,213 --> 01:24:22,880
completely without

438
01:24:22,963 --> 01:24:24,546
consideration of the consequences.

439
01:24:25,088 --> 01:24:26,546
She's a selfish bitch.

440
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:27,755
Would you like to stop?

441
01:24:30,921 --> 01:24:31,255
Stop.

442
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:32,838
You are the Matrix.

443
01:24:33,630 --> 01:24:34,880
If you are not satisfied,

444
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:36,796
you can put an end to the experience

445
01:24:37,046 --> 01:24:37,838
and go back to being

446
01:24:37,921 --> 01:24:39,463
just you on your own.

447
01:24:40,213 --> 01:24:41,171
Would you like to stop?

448
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:46,505
Will it go back to the way it was before?

449
01:24:46,921 --> 01:24:47,463
What has been

450
01:24:47,546 --> 01:24:49,005
transferred won't come back,

451
01:24:49,213 --> 01:24:50,713
but you can stop the experience.

452
01:24:50,921 --> 01:24:52,755
As of now, would you like to stop?

453
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:55,796
To go back to being just you on your own?

454
01:24:58,921 --> 01:24:59,171
No.

455
01:25:01,963 --> 01:25:03,005
No, no, no.

456
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:04,671
I can't stop.

457
01:25:06,838 --> 01:25:07,338
She just--

458
01:25:07,671 --> 01:25:08,421
I did it.

459
01:25:09,755 --> 01:25:10,213
I did it.

460
01:25:10,296 --> 01:25:12,630
I did it. I did it. 

461
01:25:15,963 --> 01:25:18,130
The balance just needs to be respected.

462
01:25:18,505 --> 01:25:19,213
So respected.

463
01:25:23,463 --> 01:25:24,630
Stop it, stop it, stop

464
01:25:24,713 --> 01:25:26,296
it, stop it, stop it.

465
01:25:35,671 --> 01:25:36,630
You are the Matrix.

466
01:25:37,921 --> 01:25:38,046
Well,

467
01:25:38,130 --> 01:25:40,380
congratulations, you've won $25,000.

468
01:25:41,005 --> 01:25:42,505
We're standing on our final chance

469
01:25:42,588 --> 01:25:43,880
and it's your second question

470
01:25:43,963 --> 01:25:45,338
in our big question

471
01:25:45,421 --> 01:25:48,463
round and play for $250,000.

472
01:25:51,796 --> 01:25:53,463
And you'll have just 45

473
01:25:53,546 --> 01:25:55,046
seconds to come up to get

474
01:25:55,171 --> 01:25:57,463
the correct answer that you can't--

475
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:55,713
Just a little something to keep you busy.

476
01:27:09,005 --> 01:27:09,130
Fuck.

477
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:25,088
Boss.

478
01:27:36,505 --> 01:27:38,838
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, she is here.

479
01:27:39,255 --> 01:27:42,671
The superstar of the moment, Sue.

480
01:27:42,838 --> 01:27:43,338
Are you ready?

481
01:27:43,713 --> 01:27:45,338
Let's welcome her, Sue.

482
01:27:48,005 --> 01:27:50,671
You popped up nowhere on

483
01:27:50,755 --> 01:27:52,380
our screens like a tornado.

484
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,505
I don't think anybody was

485
01:27:54,588 --> 01:27:56,171
really prepared for this world.

486
01:28:03,796 --> 01:28:07,005
It all started with the morning show

487
01:28:07,255 --> 01:28:09,713
and rumor has it that you are

488
01:28:09,796 --> 01:28:11,921
up for Tom Grant's next movie.

489
01:28:14,296 --> 01:28:15,713
Wait, just a moment.

490
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:18,838
I'm being told that you are going to host

491
01:28:18,921 --> 01:28:20,421
the New Year's Eve show.

492
01:28:20,505 --> 01:28:21,213
Can you confirm this?

493
01:28:22,213 --> 01:28:22,963
Yes, that's right.

494
01:28:23,755 --> 01:28:24,505
Yes, that's right.

495
01:28:27,505 --> 01:28:30,005
Oh my God, that is huge news.

496
01:28:33,463 --> 01:28:34,796
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

497
01:28:35,005 --> 01:28:35,671
Where are you from?

498
01:28:35,921 --> 01:28:37,005
How did you get discovered?

499
01:28:37,671 --> 01:28:40,546
I want, we want to know everything.

500
01:28:42,630 --> 01:28:45,838
Well, I mean, there's

501
01:28:45,921 --> 01:28:47,796
really not very much to tell.

502
01:28:48,755 --> 01:28:50,755
I'm just a girl from a

503
01:28:50,838 --> 01:28:53,171
very small town in Indiana.

504
01:28:53,755 --> 01:28:55,213
I'm sure that you've never heard of it.

505
01:28:55,630 --> 01:28:57,505
In fact, it's not even a town.

506
01:28:57,838 --> 01:28:58,755
I'm not sure you could

507
01:28:58,838 --> 01:29:00,171
really even call it a village.

508
01:29:00,255 --> 01:29:02,796
It's a farm, perhaps?

509
01:29:10,338 --> 01:29:11,880
But ever since I can remember,

510
01:29:12,088 --> 01:29:13,630
it has always been my

511
01:29:13,713 --> 01:29:15,005
dream to be on screen.

512
01:29:15,796 --> 01:29:17,588
This is my dream.

513
01:29:17,671 --> 01:29:18,588
As a child, I used to

514
01:29:18,671 --> 01:29:20,088
put on shows for my family.

515
01:29:20,713 --> 01:29:21,546
Mm, your family.

516
01:29:22,505 --> 01:29:23,380
How sweet.

517
01:29:26,296 --> 01:29:30,255
So, everyone is aware that

518
01:29:30,338 --> 01:29:33,005
you replaced Elizabeth Sparkle.

519
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:37,505
And no doubt about it, you stepped in,

520
01:29:37,755 --> 01:29:39,130
you turned up the volume,

521
01:29:39,338 --> 01:29:41,213
and you rocked their world.

522
01:29:41,838 --> 01:29:42,921
Were you a fan of her show?

523
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:52,796
Um, well, well, I can't, uh,

524
01:29:54,463 --> 01:29:55,296
I can't really say that I

525
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:57,963
actually watched her show.

526
01:29:58,838 --> 01:30:01,046
You do know that we're not exactly from

527
01:30:01,130 --> 01:30:02,088
the same generation.

528
01:30:03,421 --> 01:30:05,088
And you have to admit, it

529
01:30:05,171 --> 01:30:06,338
was a bit old-fashioned.

530
01:30:09,630 --> 01:30:10,838
Jurassic Fitness, really.

531
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:14,296
Jurassic Fitness, it needed a change.

532
01:30:16,588 --> 01:30:18,088
I'll fucking show you.

533
01:30:19,463 --> 01:30:20,171
You really wanna see

534
01:30:20,255 --> 01:30:21,380
some Jurassic Fitness?

535
01:30:24,713 --> 01:30:25,546
You want it?

536
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:28,171
Come on, come get your

537
01:30:28,255 --> 01:30:30,005
fucking Jurassic Fitness!

538
01:30:38,838 --> 01:30:41,380
But my mother was a huge fan of hers.

539
01:30:43,505 --> 01:30:46,921
So, every morning, rain or shine,

540
01:30:48,213 --> 01:30:49,921
Sparkle, your life, was on TV.

541
01:30:50,463 --> 01:30:51,796
So, in a way, I grew up with her.

542
01:30:52,755 --> 01:30:54,005
Whether I liked it or not.

543
01:30:55,505 --> 01:30:56,463
I guess that's why you could say

544
01:30:56,546 --> 01:30:58,005
we have some sort of connection.

545
01:30:58,380 --> 01:30:59,671
Some sort of connection.

546
01:31:00,213 --> 01:31:02,838
You wouldn't exist without me.

547
01:31:12,963 --> 01:31:14,005
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

548
01:31:14,255 --> 01:31:15,796
It is time, ladies and

549
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:18,255
gentlemen, for our final question.

550
01:31:18,713 --> 01:31:20,838
The question that we ask each

551
01:31:20,921 --> 01:31:24,088
and every one of our guests.

552
01:31:24,296 --> 01:31:24,463
Okay.

553
01:31:25,338 --> 01:31:27,671
Would you share one of your

554
01:31:27,755 --> 01:31:29,963
little beauty secrets with us?

555
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:33,046
Just one little trick of yours

556
01:31:33,130 --> 01:31:34,130
that helps you look

557
01:31:34,213 --> 01:31:36,088
so incredibly stunning.

558
01:31:36,171 --> 01:31:36,921
I mean, look at you.

559
01:31:37,130 --> 01:31:37,796
I don't know.

560
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:39,046
Say it!

561
01:31:39,963 --> 01:31:40,838
Say it!

562
01:31:42,213 --> 01:31:42,755
Let me think.

563
01:31:43,088 --> 01:31:43,588
Say it!

564
01:31:44,046 --> 01:31:45,213
Tell them who your

565
01:31:45,296 --> 01:31:46,796
little beauty secret is!

566
01:31:46,921 --> 01:31:48,046
I guess, I would just

567
01:31:48,130 --> 01:31:49,296
show them right here.

568
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:50,963
Here's your little beauty secret.

569
01:31:51,421 --> 01:31:52,963
I guess I just try to be myself.

570
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:54,546
To be sincere and

571
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:56,546
grateful for all that I have.

572
01:31:57,213 --> 01:31:58,046
And to always remember

573
01:31:58,130 --> 01:31:59,213
to leave with my heart.

574
01:31:59,463 --> 01:32:01,421
Oh, I'm here at the sweetheart center.

575
01:32:07,505 --> 01:32:15,755
I just, oh, I try to be myself.

576
01:32:18,296 --> 01:32:18,546
Stop it!

577
01:32:20,130 --> 01:32:20,671
Stop it.

578
01:32:21,463 --> 01:32:22,713
You're taking it from me.

579
01:32:23,505 --> 01:32:24,755
That's your little secret.

580
01:32:26,546 --> 01:32:26,880
Stop it!

581
01:32:41,838 --> 01:32:44,505
You have to control yourself!

582
01:33:04,546 --> 01:33:07,171
I can't go back, I forgot.

583
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:13,921
Oh, shit.

584
01:33:16,088 --> 01:33:18,338
Gross old rat.

585
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:19,880
Stop it!

586
01:34:34,213 --> 01:34:34,755
Coming to bed?

587
01:34:43,963 --> 01:34:46,130
Yes, I'll be right there.

588
01:35:51,505 --> 01:35:51,713
Yes.

589
01:35:52,005 --> 01:35:53,630
Hi, hi, this is emergency.

590
01:35:53,963 --> 01:35:56,130
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

591
01:35:58,838 --> 01:35:59,046
Hello?

592
01:36:01,296 --> 01:36:02,296
It's fucking 503.

593
01:36:02,921 --> 01:36:03,171
Yes.

594
01:36:03,713 --> 01:36:03,963
Fuck!

595
01:36:04,921 --> 01:36:06,046
I'm telling you, this is urgent.

596
01:36:06,296 --> 01:36:07,421
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

597
01:36:07,838 --> 01:36:09,130
It means you've reached the end.

598
01:36:12,130 --> 01:36:12,838
What do you mean the end?

599
01:36:13,213 --> 01:36:14,380
You've drained it all out.

600
01:36:15,088 --> 01:36:16,380
If you want more, you must

601
01:36:16,463 --> 01:36:17,546
let the fluid regenerate.

602
01:36:19,088 --> 01:36:20,005
Tell me how to do it.

603
01:36:20,088 --> 01:36:22,296
I need to stabilize myself right now.

604
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:23,963
You simply have to switch.

605
01:36:27,463 --> 01:36:28,130
Excuse me?

606
01:36:28,505 --> 01:36:29,838
The switch reboots the

607
01:36:29,921 --> 01:36:31,130
fluid secretion process

608
01:36:31,338 --> 01:36:32,463
so you can continue to

609
01:36:32,546 --> 01:36:33,421
enjoy the experience.

610
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,630
No, no, no, no, no.

611
01:36:36,213 --> 01:36:37,588
I can't switch, I can't.

612
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:39,338
Especially not now.

613
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:41,005
There is no other option.

614
01:37:08,338 --> 01:37:08,546
Sue?

615
01:37:21,630 --> 01:37:21,796
Babe?

616
01:37:25,838 --> 01:37:26,046
Sue?

617
01:37:27,463 --> 01:37:27,838
You all right?

618
01:37:32,005 --> 01:37:35,171
Should I start out tomorrow?

619
01:37:41,255 --> 01:37:41,671
Babe?

620
01:37:44,005 --> 01:37:46,880
Babe?

621
01:37:55,380 --> 01:37:56,171
Sue?

622
01:37:57,421 --> 01:37:58,130
Is something wrong?

623
01:38:01,921 --> 01:38:03,880
You look cranky because

624
01:38:03,963 --> 01:38:04,671
you're related business.

625
01:38:10,130 --> 01:38:10,755
Sue, open the door.

626
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:13,296
Come on, Sue.

627
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:15,713
Sue, funny, I need to take a picture.

628
01:38:17,546 --> 01:38:18,505
Sue, open the door.

629
01:38:19,505 --> 01:38:21,213
Open the door, Sue, come on.

630
01:38:40,296 --> 01:38:40,463
Come on.

631
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:51,796
Guys!

632
01:38:53,505 --> 01:38:54,296
What the fuck?

633
01:38:56,005 --> 01:38:57,255
The fuck out!

634
01:38:57,713 --> 01:38:59,880
Who's this? Who the fuck is that?

635
01:38:59,963 --> 01:39:01,255
Leave me alone!

636
01:39:04,296 --> 01:39:11,505
What the fuck?

637
01:39:53,505 --> 01:39:59,713
Doorbell

638
01:40:04,505 --> 01:40:05,505
Yes?

639
01:40:08,505 --> 01:40:10,213
It's 503.

640
01:40:12,213 --> 01:40:13,421
I want to stop.

641
01:40:13,963 --> 01:40:15,713
Are you sure? Once you

642
01:40:15,796 --> 01:40:17,130
stop, you can't go back.

643
01:40:17,755 --> 01:40:20,463
I want to stop! I want to fucking stop!

644
01:40:20,546 --> 01:40:22,963
I want to stop!

645
01:40:24,213 --> 01:40:24,505
We'll deliver.

646
01:42:35,338 --> 01:42:35,838
Are you sure?

647
01:42:38,671 --> 01:42:40,505
Once you stop, you can't go back.

648
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:43,463
You will simply remain on your own.

649
01:42:44,630 --> 01:42:46,505
Just on your own.

650
01:42:47,505 --> 01:42:50,755
Just on your own.

651
01:42:52,505 --> 01:43:21,630
Shut the fuck up! Breathing heavily

652
01:43:56,505 --> 01:43:56,546
Okay.

653
01:43:58,505 --> 01:44:01,255
I can't do this.

654
01:44:03,713 --> 01:44:06,171
I need you.

655
01:44:07,505 --> 01:44:09,588
I need myself.

656
01:44:11,838 --> 01:44:18,796
You gotta get ready. It's our big night.

657
01:44:20,046 --> 01:44:22,296
Come on. They're gonna love you so much.

658
01:44:24,005 --> 01:44:24,338
Come on.

659
01:44:25,796 --> 01:44:26,713
Come on.

660
01:44:27,921 --> 01:44:29,838
You're the only lovable part

661
01:44:29,921 --> 01:44:31,671
of me. You have to come back.

662
01:44:32,255 --> 01:44:34,130
You have to come back. Come back.

663
01:44:49,505 --> 01:44:51,005
Okay. Okay.

664
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:55,921
Come on.

665
01:44:58,338 --> 01:45:01,713
Come on.

666
01:45:08,796 --> 01:45:09,505
Come on.

667
01:47:54,796 --> 01:47:56,255
Oh, don't!

668
01:51:12,588 --> 01:51:13,505
You guys know what happened, makeup?

669
01:51:13,921 --> 01:51:15,463
Here, we gotta get you the pinning room.

670
01:51:16,546 --> 01:51:18,005
We have one final test on

671
01:51:18,088 --> 01:51:19,171
stage, lighting a sound.

672
01:51:19,255 --> 01:51:20,505
We have it in, I'll type it for the show.

673
01:51:20,671 --> 01:51:21,171
You got it?

674
01:51:21,505 --> 01:51:21,963
You good?

675
01:51:22,296 --> 01:51:22,796
Okay, let's go.

676
01:51:31,505 --> 01:51:32,505
Grab it.

677
01:51:32,796 --> 01:51:33,213
One more.

678
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:44,713
There you go.

679
01:51:52,588 --> 01:51:53,046
You good?

680
01:51:54,171 --> 01:51:55,171
You gonna dance, lads?

681
01:52:00,213 --> 01:52:01,755
I'm gonna be right back, sorry.

682
01:53:25,505 --> 01:53:30,046
 They need to see you on

683
01:53:30,130 --> 01:53:30,963
stage with the satellites.

684
01:53:55,630 --> 01:53:56,838
Have you ever dreamt

685
01:53:58,296 --> 01:53:59,755
of a better version of yourself?

686
01:54:01,505 --> 01:54:04,171
More beautiful, more perfect.

687
01:54:05,005 --> 01:54:05,213
Tim?

688
01:54:07,838 --> 01:54:09,213
Yes, let me meet you there.

689
01:54:09,755 --> 01:54:11,130
Okay, so I'll wait for you on stage.

690
01:54:28,255 --> 01:54:28,463
Sue?

691
01:54:32,671 --> 01:54:34,713
Let me introduce you to the shareholders.

692
01:54:35,046 --> 01:54:37,713
They have been dying to meet you.

693
01:54:39,671 --> 01:54:44,880
Is everything okay?

694
01:54:50,505 --> 01:54:51,296
So smile.

695
01:54:59,421 --> 01:55:01,505
That's what we want tonight.

696
01:55:02,505 --> 01:55:06,088
Pretty girls should always smile.

697
01:55:20,755 --> 01:55:22,671
Bathers, blathers, blathers.

698
01:56:14,671 --> 01:56:15,880
Hey, you ready for tonight?

699
01:57:05,838 --> 01:57:06,213
Would you be the

700
01:57:06,296 --> 01:57:07,130
better version of myself?

701
01:57:07,588 --> 01:57:08,588
Please give me a better

702
01:57:08,671 --> 01:57:10,171
version of myself, please.

703
01:57:16,755 --> 01:57:16,838
Please.

704
01:57:19,671 --> 01:57:20,463
Come on.

705
01:58:01,630 --> 01:58:04,296
Jesus.

706
01:59:15,630 --> 01:59:17,796
Looks like everything sure is in the

707
01:59:17,880 --> 01:59:19,255
right place this time.

708
01:59:21,421 --> 01:59:23,505
Please say your name, age, measurements.

709
02:02:21,421 --> 02:02:24,421
Pretty girls should always smile.

710
02:02:59,796 --> 02:03:01,213
At last, we're starting to worry.

711
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:02,213
Hurry up, you're up in five.

712
02:03:21,796 --> 02:03:23,546
There she is, so beautiful.

713
02:03:25,255 --> 02:03:26,005
We love you.

714
02:03:28,005 --> 02:03:29,338
This is where you belong.

715
02:03:29,880 --> 02:03:31,130
You always belong here.

716
02:03:31,213 --> 02:03:32,505
We can't do it without you.

717
02:03:33,005 --> 02:03:34,755
We'll never do it without you.

718
02:03:35,296 --> 02:03:36,671
Who would you replace them all?

719
02:03:36,921 --> 02:03:37,338
Oh.

720
02:04:05,171 --> 02:04:06,130
Girls, come on, let's go.

721
02:04:06,213 --> 02:04:06,921
Let's go, what are we waiting for?

722
02:04:07,380 --> 02:04:08,171
Okay, come on, everybody,

723
02:04:08,588 --> 02:04:09,880
let's go, let's go, let's go.

724
02:04:13,546 --> 02:04:15,630
You will not be disappointed.

725
02:04:17,005 --> 02:04:18,671
She's my most beautiful creation.

726
02:04:18,921 --> 02:04:20,588
I have shaped her for success.

727
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:32,796
Five, four, three, two, one.

728
02:07:28,338 --> 02:07:29,005
The monster!

729
02:07:38,130 --> 02:07:39,005
Shoot the monster!

730
02:07:40,796 --> 02:07:41,796
It's a freak!

731
02:07:42,755 --> 02:07:43,796
The monster!

732
02:07:46,421 --> 02:07:47,380
Don't be a bird.

733
02:07:47,588 --> 02:07:48,130
Monster!

734
02:07:48,505 --> 02:07:49,963
You're stupid.

735
02:07:50,505 --> 02:07:51,338
It's real.

736
02:07:52,380 --> 02:07:55,130
I'm a little bit, I'm a little bit.

737
02:08:00,421 --> 02:08:00,588
Freak!

738
02:08:13,963 --> 02:08:16,963
Freak, monster, monster!

739
02:08:21,588 --> 02:08:22,505
It's me.

740
02:08:24,963 --> 02:08:25,713
It's me.

741
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:36,755
I'm just kidding.

742
02:09:31,796 --> 02:09:32,921
Too bad her boobs aren't

743
02:09:33,005 --> 02:09:33,963
in the middle of her face

744
02:09:34,130 --> 02:09:35,338
instead of that nose.

745
02:09:37,421 --> 02:09:37,588
Hmm.

746
02:09:39,380 --> 02:09:39,505
Next!

747
02:09:46,088 --> 02:09:48,921
Pretty girls should always smile.

748
02:09:54,671 --> 02:09:55,296
I have 50.

749
02:09:56,296 --> 02:09:56,838
It stops.

750
02:12:58,338 --> 02:12:58,880
I love you.

751
02:12:59,713 --> 02:13:01,505
I love you.

752
02:13:04,921 --> 02:13:06,213
You're a place of all.
