1
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:33,161
Hey, slow down, Mike.

2
00:01:33,295 --> 00:01:34,595
Okay? You're making me sick.

3
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:37,099
I would slow down if you hadn't
already made us late.

4
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,471
W-We're not late, okay?

5
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:44,907
You're just anxious.

6
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,309
No, I'm anxious
'cause you made us late.

7
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,477
And I'm not doing this with you
in the next phase of our lives.

8
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,879
You're gonna respect my time.

9
00:01:56,051 --> 00:01:57,386
My stomach. My stomach.

10
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:58,686
Hey, Mike, look.

11
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,222
Pull over at that store
right there.

12
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:01,789
I need a ginger ale.

13
00:02:01,924 --> 00:02:04,826
Look, we don't have no time
to get no ginger ale, man.

14
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,761
Come on, Mike, I'm sick.

15
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:08,729
You're freaking me out, okay?

16
00:02:08,864 --> 00:02:11,632
-I feel like I'm gonna throw...
-throw up.

17
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:13,768
I dare you, Marcus.

18
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,078
You got 90 seconds, all right?

19
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:24,947
Ginger ale and nothing else.

20
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,182
I am a grown-ass man.

21
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:29,684
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay? Just be nice.

22
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:32,087
Oh, okay. 85 seconds.

23
00:02:49,137 --> 00:02:51,373
Ooh-ooh!

24
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:55,310
Are those dogs fresh?

25
00:02:55,444 --> 00:02:57,045
I put 'em on yesterday.

26
00:02:57,179 --> 00:03:00,382
Well, give me one
and, uh, put some relish

27
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,650
and some mustard
on that motherfucker.

28
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:04,485
Hook it up. Come on, hurry up.

29
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,188
Yeah, no, that one right there.

30
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:08,689
Yeah. Yeah, that right there.
Hurry up.

31
00:03:10,058 --> 00:03:11,659
Got to go, got to go.

32
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:13,295
Don't be taking your time.

33
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:17,199
Yeah, my man. Oh.

34
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,035
Hey, open the register.

35
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,704
-No, no, no.
-Now!

36
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:25,706
Sir, today is not the day.

37
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:26,842
Shut the fuck up!

38
00:03:26,975 --> 00:03:28,877
Look, if I'm not in that car

39
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,846
in 15 seconds...

40
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,646
there's a very surly man

41
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,850
that's coming in here,
and we both are fucked.

42
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:36,451
-Marcus.
-Hey, don't fucking move!

43
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,453
Get the fuck over there!

44
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,889
Hey, Mike,
I told this guy I had to go.

45
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:43,724
Mm-mm. Is that Skittles
on the counter, Marcus?

46
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:46,627
Well, he was taking a long time
w-with the ginger ale.

47
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:48,463
That is incorrect.
He grabbed that ginger ale

48
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:49,898
the second he came in here.

49
00:03:50,032 --> 00:03:51,766
A hot dog, Marcus?

50
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,435
You're not supposed to be
eating that shit.

51
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,504
-This is not mine, Mike.
-Yes, it is.

52
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:59,041
Mind your business
with your tattletaling ass.

53
00:03:59,174 --> 00:04:00,409
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

54
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,878
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to lower your weapon.

55
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:05,013
Come take my weapon, then,
motherfucker.

56
00:04:05,147 --> 00:04:06,214
Don't antagonize him.

57
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:07,983
Marcus, get in the car.

58
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:10,385
Mike, he has a gun to my head.

59
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:13,221
Want to deal with him
or you want to deal with me?

60
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:16,925
Sorry, sir, but I got to go.

61
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:26,767
You didn't
have to shoot him, Mike.

62
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:29,603
Get in the car.

63
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:33,075
Call 911.

64
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,243
Aren't you the police?

65
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:45,719
Other people look at you
and see the tailored suits,

66
00:04:45,854 --> 00:04:48,390
the cars, the watches.

67
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:50,459
I met you without any of that--

68
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,428
stripped, basically naked--

69
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:56,932
which is 90% of why
I'm marrying you.

70
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:02,904
I met you at your lowest.

71
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:04,973
You'd been shot.

72
00:05:05,107 --> 00:05:10,512
But there was a fire in you
that was extraordinary.

73
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,251
And I vow to spend the rest
of my life fanning that flame.

74
00:05:19,054 --> 00:05:23,458
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

75
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:25,793
You may kiss the bride.

76
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:28,130
Yes.

77
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:42,643
You know,
it kind of makes sense

78
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,013
that he married his therapist
after he got shot.

79
00:05:45,147 --> 00:05:46,281
-I love that for him.
-Mm-hmm.

80
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:47,949
Mental health
is super important.

81
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:49,584
Well, it was
his physical therapist.

82
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,153
Congratulations, Michael.

83
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:52,954
Rita. Thank you, thank you.

84
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:54,788
Mr. Mayor.

85
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:56,324
Oh, not yet. Don't jinx it.

86
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,826
I'm still just a lowly
U.S. Attorney.

87
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,694
Uh, I've been watching
what you're doing.

88
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:02,464
-You got my vote.
-Aw, thank you.

89
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:03,965
Congratulations to you.

90
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:05,267
-Well...
-I mean,

91
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,536
the definition of
a power couple right there.

92
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:10,639
-I'll, uh, grab you a drink.
-Okay.

93
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:11,940
Can I get you anything?

94
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:13,575
No, I'm good. Thank you.

95
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:17,412
And all this time, I thought
you were a terminal bachelor.

96
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:19,780
I-I, uh...

97
00:06:19,915 --> 00:06:21,715
I even surprised myself
with this one.

98
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,020
Yeah, I guess you just hadn't
met the right one.

99
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:27,189
I had some growing up to do.

100
00:06:27,322 --> 00:06:29,057
You were 50.

101
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:30,425
Uh...

102
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,127
Whew.

103
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,929
Okay, uh...

104
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:38,033
I'm gonna pre-apologize
for whatever he says.

105
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:42,070
Uh-uh.
-Mike.

106
00:06:42,204 --> 00:06:43,405
-Uh-uh-uh. Don't sta...
-No.

107
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:44,738
-Marcus.
-You know how it is.

108
00:06:44,873 --> 00:06:46,408
-Marcus. Come...
-Let me get it out.

109
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,809
Come on, man.

110
00:06:47,943 --> 00:06:49,945
-Everything you done
been through, man. -Okay.

111
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:52,180
The witch, the Bruja.

112
00:06:52,314 --> 00:06:53,515
The prostitute.

113
00:06:53,648 --> 00:06:55,150
My sister.

114
00:06:55,283 --> 00:06:58,220
Remember? You could've told me
about my sister, Mike.

115
00:06:58,353 --> 00:06:59,720
You could've told me that.

116
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:02,691
I would've embraced you
if that's who she was feeling.

117
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:04,292
-I love you, Mike.
-No doubt.

118
00:07:05,527 --> 00:07:08,630
You know, Cap would've loved
to been here to see this.

119
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,467
But you know what,
we got his daughter Judy

120
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:14,402
and his granddaughter Callie.

121
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:15,769
She wants to say something.

122
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,976
Um, my granddad loved you guys,

123
00:07:21,109 --> 00:07:23,044
and if he were here,

124
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:25,880
he would've told you
not to eff this up.

125
00:07:27,582 --> 00:07:28,817
That's what he would've said.

126
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,286
Yeah, he would've said,
"Don't fuck it up." Oh!

127
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:32,487
Exactly.

128
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:34,055
Oh, excuse... excuse me.

129
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,557
Hey.

130
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:40,295
Mike, you been my partner
a long time.

131
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:41,896
Yes, sir.

132
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,866
Now he's gonna be
your partner, Christine.

133
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:49,204
To Mike and Christine Lowrey...

134
00:07:49,337 --> 00:07:51,740
-for life!
-For life!

135
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:09,724
Go, Marcus!

136
00:08:31,313 --> 00:08:32,847
What happened? What happened?

137
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:34,616
Marcus. Marcus!

138
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:36,618
-Sir, what's the address?
-Let me in. Let me in.

139
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:38,320
-Let me in. Let me in. Back up!
-What's the address?

140
00:08:38,453 --> 00:08:39,954
This is Captain Rita Secada.

141
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:42,123
I have an officer
in cardiac arrest.

142
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,469
Come on, man.

143
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,916
It's not your time.

144
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:38,406
Marcus!

145
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:45,146
Marc...

146
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:48,918
This guy.

147
00:11:00,428 --> 00:11:02,497
Hey, buddy.

148
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,299
What you doing?

149
00:11:04,432 --> 00:11:08,336
I spent my whole life
being scared, Mike.

150
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,638
I wasted so much time.

151
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:12,774
Wh-Why don't you, uh...
why don't you just, uh,

152
00:11:12,908 --> 00:11:15,176
step back from the edge
a little bit, please.

153
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:17,645
What year is it?

154
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:19,614
It's Tuesday.

155
00:11:20,648 --> 00:11:22,852
Same year your ass
was wobbling in.

156
00:11:22,984 --> 00:11:25,855
Oh, wow.
Felt like it was five years.

157
00:11:25,987 --> 00:11:28,958
I was in the basement
of the ocean.

158
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,259
All my bullshit was gone.

159
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:33,495
Just freedom.

160
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:35,530
And full-body love, Mike.

161
00:11:35,663 --> 00:11:37,499
-Full-body love.
-All right. Okay.

162
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:39,634
Wh-Why-Why don't you, uh,

163
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:43,037
love your full body back
from the-the ledge, please?

164
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:44,506
Nothing to be scared of.

165
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,274
It's not my time, baby.

166
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:47,609
It's not my time.

167
00:11:47,742 --> 00:11:49,043
Mr. Burnett!

168
00:11:49,177 --> 00:11:51,513
Uh, uh, hey, uh, I got him.

169
00:11:51,646 --> 00:11:53,816
He-he-he's just, um...

170
00:11:56,017 --> 00:11:58,052
I don't know
what the fuck he's doing.

171
00:11:58,186 --> 00:12:00,021
Uh, but I got it.

172
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:02,858
I-I got him.
We're good. We are good.

173
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:05,093
-We are great!
-Hey.

174
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:06,996
-Miami!
-Whoa.

175
00:12:07,128 --> 00:12:08,796
305 for life!

176
00:12:08,931 --> 00:12:10,298
Kakow!

177
00:12:10,431 --> 00:12:11,733
-All right, just...
-Kakow!

178
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:13,368
You gonna put somebody's
eye out with that thing, man.

179
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:15,036
I'm bringing the thunder, Mike.

180
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,671
-I get it.
-Bringing the thunder.

181
00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:19,407
Yeah, all right. There you go.

182
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,843
Oh, man.

183
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:22,277
Bring it in.

184
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,913
Thought I lost you, brother.

185
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:26,581
Couldn't lose me if you tried.

186
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,419
You know your ass is out,
right?

187
00:12:31,553 --> 00:12:33,721
Everybody's ass is out, Mike.

188
00:12:33,856 --> 00:12:35,423
Hey.

189
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:38,192
There's a storm coming.

190
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:42,664
No, not that kind of storm.

191
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:44,732
You're gonna be tested.

192
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:46,568
Things are gonna get bad,

193
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:49,203
and you're gonna have to make
a really hard choice.

194
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:52,975
Just know you're good.

195
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:20,702
This is my private time,
Mr. McGrath.

196
00:13:20,836 --> 00:13:22,136
How may I help you?

197
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,172
I need you to move some money.

198
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:26,240
-Your money?
-Your boss's, actually.

199
00:13:26,374 --> 00:13:27,943
I need it to be cartel cash.

200
00:13:28,077 --> 00:13:29,744
Just under 20 million.

201
00:13:29,878 --> 00:13:31,446
Backdated series of transfers--

202
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:34,582
beginning 2004,
ending January 2020--

203
00:13:34,716 --> 00:13:38,319
into that account

204
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:41,322
in the name of the late
Captain Conrad Howard.

205
00:13:42,223 --> 00:13:44,392
I have people
who can handle logistics.

206
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:47,096
I really just need
your log-in credentials.

207
00:13:47,228 --> 00:13:49,464
And why would I give you those?

208
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:52,734
Oh, my God!

209
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:54,469
Shh.

210
00:13:57,772 --> 00:13:59,474
Come here, darling.

211
00:14:00,475 --> 00:14:02,443
Come on.

212
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:05,114
Come here.

213
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:13,421
You can't transfer funds
from a phone.

214
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:20,528
Hey, honey. What's going on?

215
00:14:20,662 --> 00:14:23,464
Do... do...
do they know each other?

216
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:26,802
Honey, who's there with you?

217
00:14:26,935 --> 00:14:28,536
-All right, all right.
-Honey...

218
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,380
Here we go.

219
00:14:43,018 --> 00:14:44,953
They'll kill you for this.

220
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:46,889
They're not even gonna know
this happened.

221
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:52,694
Your girlfriend heard you
on the phone with your wife

222
00:14:52,828 --> 00:14:55,563
and realized you were never
gonna divorce her.

223
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:58,366
And in a fit of passion,
she shot you.

224
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:01,837
Your bodyguard tried
to step in,

225
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,172
but he was too late.

226
00:15:05,373 --> 00:15:08,309
And realizing the horror
of her actions...

227
00:15:10,979 --> 00:15:12,747
-...she took her own life.
-No!

228
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:25,226
Honey, what are you doing?

229
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,595
-You had a heart attack
two weeks ago. -Exactly.

230
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:29,397
They call it a widow-maker
for a reason.

231
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,900
You need to be
in the hospital, baby.

232
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:34,235
Hey, I tried to...
Told his ass, T.

233
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:36,437
He... Yeah, uh,
apparently, he's an adult.

234
00:15:36,571 --> 00:15:38,207
He was allowed
to sign hisself out.

235
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,209
Hey, babe, look.

236
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:42,945
Come on. I couldn't take
one more second away from you.

237
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:46,414
All these stents in me
got my blood flowing.

238
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:48,349
I'm on "D" way.

239
00:15:48,483 --> 00:15:50,318
All right, now.

240
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:51,619
Oh, hey, hey.

241
00:15:51,753 --> 00:15:53,155
Come on, man. That's my phone.

242
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,690
-I love you, Marcus.
-We'll be there in ten.

243
00:15:55,824 --> 00:15:57,759
All right, babe.
All right. Love you.

244
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:02,630
Hey, Mike, I wasn't even
gonna tell you this,

245
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:04,632
but this ain't
the first time we done this.

246
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:06,969
We ride together all the time.
What you mean?

247
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:08,804
No, I'm talking about
our souls.

248
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:10,538
You know,
we've ridden together,

249
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:12,241
but I saw it all, Mike.

250
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:15,610
We're bound, and we have been
for lifetimes.

251
00:16:15,743 --> 00:16:17,946
We haven't always been
Mike and Marcus,

252
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,915
but we've always been us.

253
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:21,415
Um...

254
00:16:22,818 --> 00:16:23,986
What you talking about?

255
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:25,888
We're soulmates.

256
00:16:27,923 --> 00:16:29,657
-Yep.
-Yeah.

257
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:30,993
Nah.

258
00:16:31,126 --> 00:16:33,461
Yeah, I kind of...
I-I saw my soulmate looking

259
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:35,496
a little different than that.

260
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,799
See, see, see, Mike,
you stuck in the physical.

261
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:39,767
Souls don't have dicks.

262
00:16:39,902 --> 00:16:41,904
I'm pretty sure my soul
has a dick, Marcus.

263
00:16:42,037 --> 00:16:44,873
See?
That's that shit right there.

264
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:46,307
That's why we're stuck.

265
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,144
You know, I wasn't gonna
tell you this shit, either...

266
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:51,146
-Mm-hmm.
-...but, uh, my soul is

267
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,881
more advanced than your soul.

268
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:54,615
Mm. Mm-hmm.

269
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:57,485
It's not that your soul
is stupid.

270
00:16:57,618 --> 00:16:58,653
-Mm-hmm.
-You know?

271
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:00,889
It's just that
you're more like a...

272
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:03,591
-a baby soul, you know?
-Mm-hmm.

273
00:17:03,724 --> 00:17:05,928
And I'm more like
a mother soul.

274
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:07,963
-Mm-hmm.
-And I just got to suckle you.

275
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:09,497
You know?

276
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,900
-Put you on that titty, okay?
-Oh, yeah.

277
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:13,802
You know?

278
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:17,471
Hey, how long you think
your brain went without oxygen?

279
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:21,810
Daddy's home.

280
00:17:21,944 --> 00:17:24,378
-Where my family?
-Honey, you're back.

281
00:17:24,512 --> 00:17:26,215
-My family.
-Oh, baby.

282
00:17:26,347 --> 00:17:27,883
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

283
00:17:29,517 --> 00:17:31,954
-Look. Granddaddy.
-Oh! Little Marcus!

284
00:17:32,087 --> 00:17:33,354
Say hi to Pop-Pop.

285
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:35,190
-Hi.
-Say hi to Granddad.

286
00:17:35,324 --> 00:17:37,125
-Yes.
-Aw. I missed you so...

287
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:38,994
-Look at you, woman.
-Look at...

288
00:17:39,127 --> 00:17:41,897
-No, come on. Look at me, baby.
-Mm, mm.

289
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:48,402
We're gonna
have to hose them down.

290
00:17:48,536 --> 00:17:50,172
All right.
All right, we get it.

291
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:52,174
We get it.

292
00:17:52,307 --> 00:17:54,709
Put some ice in your drawers
or something.

293
00:17:54,843 --> 00:17:57,411
Aw, that's funny.

294
00:17:57,545 --> 00:17:59,014
Are you feeling good, Marcus?

295
00:17:59,147 --> 00:18:00,916
I never felt better in my life.

296
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:02,516
Oh, Marcus.

297
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,553
I missed you so much, honey,
but you need to get some rest.

298
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:08,090
Oh, no, baby. I need you.

299
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:09,590
Just let me get
some electrolytes.

300
00:18:09,724 --> 00:18:12,227
-Okay, baby. Give me a kiss.
-All right.

301
00:18:13,228 --> 00:18:15,396
So, what's going on
with my dad?

302
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:19,167
Um, well, he-he was
on the roof, uh, naked.

303
00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:21,535
And, uh, he said he had been

304
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:24,006
at the basement of the ocean.

305
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:27,042
"Amazing Chickpeas"?

306
00:18:27,175 --> 00:18:30,045
Uh, oh, and he said, uh,
I have a stupid baby soul

307
00:18:30,178 --> 00:18:31,947
-with no penis.
-Hmm. Mm.

308
00:18:34,482 --> 00:18:35,750
Hey, Reggie!

309
00:18:35,884 --> 00:18:38,020
-Yes, sir.
-Did you eat my snacks?

310
00:18:38,153 --> 00:18:39,321
No... no, sir.

311
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,722
I was looking forward
to my snacks, Reggie.

312
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:44,259
-Honey.
-Ah...

313
00:18:46,194 --> 00:18:47,963
You know what?
You need to get a job.

314
00:18:48,096 --> 00:18:49,764
I'm a U.S. Marine, sir.

315
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:51,366
Well, then you need to deploy.

316
00:18:51,499 --> 00:18:53,101
We just got back from Yemen.

317
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:55,270
Thank you for your service.

318
00:18:55,404 --> 00:18:57,839
-You thought I was dead,
didn't you? -Dead?

319
00:18:57,973 --> 00:18:59,341
One thing you don't know,
Reggie:

320
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:01,442
I got a camera up in here.

321
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:02,743
Yeah.

322
00:19:08,449 --> 00:19:09,650
Theresa!

323
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:11,552
It's the doctor's orders,
Marcus.

324
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:14,089
You're on a strict diet:
no salt, no sugar, no fats.

325
00:19:14,222 --> 00:19:17,092
No stress, no loud noises,
no physical exertion.

326
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:18,693
Just sit your ass down
somewhere, man.

327
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:20,628
Tell him, Mike.

328
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:22,563
And, honey,
I'm doing it with you.

329
00:19:22,697 --> 00:19:23,966
We're now vegetarians.

330
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:26,467
Vegetarians? Look at me.

331
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,804
Look at all this man, baby.

332
00:19:28,937 --> 00:19:30,205
I'm brand-new.

333
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:33,208
I need animal sugars
to survive.

334
00:19:33,342 --> 00:19:37,312
Well, baby,
I have a salad for you.

335
00:19:37,446 --> 00:19:39,114
-A salad?
-Hey.

336
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:41,116
Uh, T, looks like
you got this under control.

337
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:42,783
Uh, my tour of duty is done.

338
00:19:42,918 --> 00:19:44,552
Bye, Christine. Bye, Mike.

339
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:45,921
-Bye, guys.
-H-Hey, Mike.

340
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:47,688
Wait up. Wait up, wait up.

341
00:19:47,823 --> 00:19:49,157
-Yeah, yeah.
-What you about to do?

342
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,959
Can you run a quick-quick
for me?

343
00:19:51,093 --> 00:19:52,526
What... Yeah, what you need?

344
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,264
Um, I'll give you a thousand
dollars for some Skittles.

345
00:19:56,398 --> 00:19:59,334
Marcus, I am not buying
your ass no candy, man.

346
00:19:59,468 --> 00:20:02,337
Okay. 2,000, Mike,
for some Ding Dongs.

347
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:04,139
And that's my final offer.

348
00:20:04,272 --> 00:20:06,942
I think you're gonna be
Ding Dong-less.

349
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:08,642
Like my soul.

350
00:20:39,474 --> 00:20:42,177
You always take whoever I love.

351
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:48,216
This is Detective Mike Lowrey.

352
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,251
Captain is down.

353
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:50,852
He's my son.

354
00:20:50,986 --> 00:20:53,288
You got
a fucked-up family, Mike.

355
00:21:16,644 --> 00:21:18,413
Department of Justice
has been investigating

356
00:21:18,547 --> 00:21:20,614
the corruption
in the Miami Police Department,

357
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:23,151
and we now have
credible intelligence

358
00:21:23,285 --> 00:21:26,521
that Captain Conrad Howard
was directing these elements

359
00:21:26,654 --> 00:21:28,722
in coordination
with the cartels.

360
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,662
No, I'm not interested
in approximately what time.

361
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:36,398
I need to know
exactly what time.

362
00:21:36,531 --> 00:21:37,966
Do you understand?

363
00:21:38,967 --> 00:21:40,102
You knew about this?

364
00:21:40,235 --> 00:21:42,571
I found out two weeks ago.

365
00:21:42,703 --> 00:21:44,139
A press conference? Really?

366
00:21:44,272 --> 00:21:46,441
I'm sorry about the way
you had to find out,

367
00:21:46,575 --> 00:21:47,809
but given your closeness...

368
00:21:47,943 --> 00:21:49,144
Our closeness?

369
00:21:49,277 --> 00:21:50,778
Neither one of y'all
would have a job

370
00:21:50,912 --> 00:21:52,680
if it wasn't for
Captain Howard.

371
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:54,615
Rita, you know
this is not true.

372
00:21:54,748 --> 00:21:57,319
Honestly, I don't.

373
00:21:57,452 --> 00:21:59,753
The investigation
has turned up new evidence.

374
00:21:59,888 --> 00:22:01,423
Miami law enforcement's been

375
00:22:01,556 --> 00:22:03,158
a leaky ship for years now.

376
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:04,625
Witnesses turn up dead.

377
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:06,328
Informants disappear.

378
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:09,331
Events appear random
until you aggregate them

379
00:22:09,464 --> 00:22:11,466
over a period of years.

380
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,401
Then a pattern emerges.

381
00:22:13,535 --> 00:22:14,970
Who is this?

382
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:18,573
Bud Grice, FBI, heading up
the JTF on this show.

383
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:19,875
That's who I am.

384
00:22:20,008 --> 00:22:23,211
Now, we knew someone was
providing intelligence

385
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:25,713
to a cartel moving product
into South Florida.

386
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:27,482
We just didn't know who.

387
00:22:27,616 --> 00:22:29,417
A cartel banker turned up dead

388
00:22:29,551 --> 00:22:31,520
two weeks ago,
shot by his girlfriend.

389
00:22:31,652 --> 00:22:34,022
They found a phone
with Howard's contact on it.

390
00:22:34,156 --> 00:22:35,957
Years of communication
with the cartel,

391
00:22:36,091 --> 00:22:38,393
account references offshore.

392
00:22:38,527 --> 00:22:40,228
Millions in Howard's name.

393
00:22:40,362 --> 00:22:42,531
Final piece we needed to nail
that dirty motherfucker.

394
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:43,797
-Grice.
-Oh, whoa.

395
00:22:43,932 --> 00:22:45,233
Hey, hey. Let me holla at you.

396
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:48,970
Um, you know I was with him
when he went down, right?

397
00:22:49,971 --> 00:22:52,841
Call him dirty one more time.

398
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:54,242
I dare you.

399
00:22:56,278 --> 00:22:58,146
We know he had others
who were with him.

400
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,514
We're gonna find them, too.

401
00:22:59,648 --> 00:23:01,950
I was with him.
Put the cuffs on me right now.

402
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,784
-I was with him.
-Mike.

403
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,820
No, these motherfuckers think
that just 'cause he's dead

404
00:23:05,954 --> 00:23:07,422
and can't defend hisself,

405
00:23:07,556 --> 00:23:10,492
they gonna dump all this shit
on him, burn his legacy.

406
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,427
Not on my watch.

407
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:19,568
This is Judy Howard,
U.S. Marshals.

408
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,903
I realize I have
no jurisdiction here,

409
00:23:22,037 --> 00:23:24,940
but as a professional courtesy,
I'd like to request visibility

410
00:23:25,073 --> 00:23:27,676
into the sources of the
allegations against my father.

411
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:29,211
Judy.

412
00:23:29,344 --> 00:23:32,214
We're gonna figure
this shit out, all right?

413
00:23:32,347 --> 00:23:33,882
How's Callie?

414
00:23:35,116 --> 00:23:36,851
How do you think, Mike?

415
00:23:36,985 --> 00:23:39,554
We're on the same team here,
Judy.

416
00:23:39,688 --> 00:23:40,956
Like hell we are, Mike.

417
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:43,225
My dad would still be alive
if it weren't for

418
00:23:43,358 --> 00:23:45,427
-your bastard son.
-Judy.

419
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,329
If I ever catch him
out on the street,

420
00:23:47,462 --> 00:23:50,731
I swear on my father
I will put him down.

421
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:54,069
Come on. Come on, man. Come on.

422
00:23:58,373 --> 00:23:59,874
So, what's our next move?

423
00:24:00,008 --> 00:24:02,043
They said he was working
with the cartel.

424
00:24:02,177 --> 00:24:03,678
Let's ask the cartel.

425
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:16,691
How you doing?

426
00:24:16,825 --> 00:24:18,260
It's prison.

427
00:24:18,393 --> 00:24:19,594
Yeah.

428
00:24:19,728 --> 00:24:22,931
Look, we need your help.

429
00:24:23,064 --> 00:24:24,933
They're saying that
Captain Howard was dirty.

430
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:27,669
Do you know anything
about that?

431
00:24:27,802 --> 00:24:29,604
How much time I get off
for this one?

432
00:24:29,738 --> 00:24:31,273
I'm still working on that.

433
00:24:31,406 --> 00:24:34,876
This is me telling you
that I need you.

434
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,144
Mm.

435
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:38,580
I need to know
if Captain Howard

436
00:24:38,713 --> 00:24:40,982
was working with the cartels.

437
00:24:43,885 --> 00:24:45,887
No.

438
00:24:46,021 --> 00:24:48,590
He was onto the ones that were.

439
00:24:48,723 --> 00:24:50,392
So he got green-lit.

440
00:24:52,227 --> 00:24:54,629
Wait, no.
No, Captain Howard was killed

441
00:24:54,763 --> 00:24:56,631
because he was on
your mother's hit list.

442
00:24:56,765 --> 00:24:58,733
He was added to it.

443
00:24:59,768 --> 00:25:02,470
Your people wanted it
to look like us.

444
00:25:02,604 --> 00:25:04,739
Your people wanted him dead.

445
00:25:04,873 --> 00:25:07,075
What you mean "our people"?

446
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:09,444
You should be careful.

447
00:25:09,577 --> 00:25:12,180
You're playing a game when
you don't even know the rules.

448
00:25:12,314 --> 00:25:14,382
There's dirty players
on your side.

449
00:25:14,516 --> 00:25:16,651
-That's bullshit.
-Wait, who?

450
00:25:17,652 --> 00:25:19,020
I saw him one time.

451
00:25:24,092 --> 00:25:26,094
-Can you I.D. him?
-Sí.

452
00:25:27,162 --> 00:25:28,463
Give me a name.

453
00:25:28,596 --> 00:25:29,864
I don't know his name.

454
00:25:29,998 --> 00:25:31,466
My mother.

455
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,668
She's the one
who dealt with him.

456
00:25:33,803 --> 00:25:37,505
I knew we should've
kept that damn witch alive.

457
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:38,840
Marcus.

458
00:25:38,973 --> 00:25:41,209
May she rest in peace.

459
00:25:41,343 --> 00:25:42,977
Dude.

460
00:25:50,285 --> 00:25:52,320
Hey, boss.
Our man on the inside

461
00:25:52,454 --> 00:25:54,956
got all of Howard's records
in the JTF file.

462
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,392
Computers, phones,
files, all of it.

463
00:25:57,525 --> 00:25:59,260
Well, we know Howard
was onto our operation.

464
00:25:59,394 --> 00:26:00,895
We just don't know
how much he had.

465
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:02,731
We need to make sure
we got every trace.

466
00:26:02,864 --> 00:26:04,733
That's beautiful.

467
00:26:04,866 --> 00:26:06,634
Hey, boss.

468
00:26:06,768 --> 00:26:08,838
It's all the paper files.
They're clean so far.

469
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,338
Two phones had nothing.

470
00:26:10,472 --> 00:26:11,841
His office computer was empty.

471
00:26:11,973 --> 00:26:13,408
-He was careful.
-But?

472
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:14,943
But his old personal laptop

473
00:26:15,076 --> 00:26:16,611
had weak encryption.

474
00:26:16,745 --> 00:26:20,248
Here... we go.

475
00:26:21,483 --> 00:26:22,917
Shit.

476
00:26:23,051 --> 00:26:24,919
We tripped a fail-safe.

477
00:26:25,053 --> 00:26:26,554
The fuck you mean, "we"?

478
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,423
Something was sent.

479
00:26:28,556 --> 00:26:30,358
To who?

480
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:32,927
Tracing the phone now.

481
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:40,769
What the hell?

482
00:26:40,902 --> 00:26:42,872
He's texting us
from the other side.

483
00:26:43,004 --> 00:26:45,140
No, he's not, Marcus.

484
00:26:49,845 --> 00:26:54,282
If you're seeing this,
I'm probably dead.

485
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:57,385
Fuck. Fuck me.

486
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,756
Before I begin,
I want to say one thing:

487
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:04,392
I'm putting you
in mortal danger.

488
00:27:04,526 --> 00:27:08,696
Boys, we got rats in our walls.

489
00:27:08,831 --> 00:27:13,535
But I-I got to make sure
you're my bad boys.

490
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,772
The Coke bottle giant
is the key.

491
00:27:17,907 --> 00:27:19,574
What?

492
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:22,610
Don't trust anybody.

493
00:27:24,847 --> 00:27:26,114
What's that?
What does that mean?

494
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:29,317
"The Coke bottle giant."

495
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,288
Fletcher.

496
00:27:33,421 --> 00:27:35,123
Oh, shit.

497
00:27:35,256 --> 00:27:36,758
These are the guys.

498
00:27:39,862 --> 00:27:41,563
We should put a bullet
in these motherfuckers.

499
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,932
Be done with it
once and for all.

500
00:27:43,064 --> 00:27:44,332
Lintz, I love you.

501
00:27:44,466 --> 00:27:46,234
I'd like nothing more
than to let you loose on them,

502
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:48,938
but extra dead cops
doesn't do us any favors here.

503
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:51,807
Keep them
under constant surveillance

504
00:27:51,941 --> 00:27:53,975
and see if they make a move.

505
00:27:57,645 --> 00:27:59,849
Fletcher's warehouse
is right down that alley.

506
00:27:59,981 --> 00:28:02,016
Mike, I wasn't even gonna
tell you this...

507
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,853
Ugh. Then don't tell me.

508
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:05,620
No, you got to hear this.

509
00:28:05,753 --> 00:28:07,055
This is big.

510
00:28:07,188 --> 00:28:09,324
I can't die.

511
00:28:09,457 --> 00:28:11,092
What?

512
00:28:11,226 --> 00:28:13,161
I cannot die.

513
00:28:13,294 --> 00:28:15,129
Motherfucker, you did
a pretty good job of dying

514
00:28:15,263 --> 00:28:17,298
at my wedding
a couple weeks ago.

515
00:28:17,432 --> 00:28:19,000
But I didn't.

516
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:21,069
Watch.

517
00:28:21,202 --> 00:28:22,504
Hey, Marcus.

518
00:28:24,472 --> 00:28:26,107
Hey!

519
00:28:27,742 --> 00:28:28,911
Hey!

520
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:33,916
Hey! Marcus! Marcus!

521
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:36,417
Hey, stop, stop. Hey. Hey!

522
00:28:36,551 --> 00:28:37,652
Marcus!

523
00:28:37,785 --> 00:28:38,921
What are you,
some kind of moron?

524
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:40,421
Stop, stop.

525
00:28:42,457 --> 00:28:43,491
Please stop!

526
00:28:46,996 --> 00:28:49,364
-Hey!
-Bro!

527
00:28:49,497 --> 00:28:50,565
Slow down!

528
00:28:50,698 --> 00:28:52,166
Crosswalk!

529
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,701
Ah...

530
00:28:56,805 --> 00:28:58,072
Talk to me.

531
00:28:58,206 --> 00:29:00,208
-You got to trust, Mike.
-Mm-hmm.

532
00:29:00,341 --> 00:29:01,743
Trust yourself.

533
00:29:01,877 --> 00:29:03,879
Trust the universe.

534
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,214
Stop that shit, Marcus.

535
00:29:06,347 --> 00:29:08,416
It's not my time, Mike.

536
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,418
Oh, okay, so you're saying

537
00:29:10,552 --> 00:29:12,554
that if I shoot you
in your face,

538
00:29:12,687 --> 00:29:14,489
you're saying
that you won't die?

539
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:17,860
Fate dictates that you won't
shoot me in the face.

540
00:29:17,993 --> 00:29:20,762
I'm saying...
I'm-I'm saying that you saying

541
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:23,032
that if I shoot you
in your face,

542
00:29:23,164 --> 00:29:25,034
are you saying you won't die?

543
00:29:25,166 --> 00:29:27,402
Fate doesn't deal
in hypotheticals, Mike.

544
00:29:27,535 --> 00:29:29,704
¡Oye! ¿Qué estás haciendo?

545
00:29:29,838 --> 00:29:31,372
I'm going to call the police!

546
00:29:31,506 --> 00:29:32,875
They're already here, ma'am.

547
00:29:33,008 --> 00:29:34,208
Mind your business.

548
00:29:34,342 --> 00:29:36,377
Just go to the beach.

549
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:38,212
Stop that shit, Marcus.

550
00:29:40,214 --> 00:29:42,383
See? You're putting
your gun away.

551
00:29:42,517 --> 00:29:44,252
He's putting his gun away.

552
00:29:51,092 --> 00:29:53,328
Ooh. Mike.

553
00:29:57,732 --> 00:29:59,534
Focus, man.

554
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:01,269
Yeah, I call this place,
you know,

555
00:30:01,402 --> 00:30:03,705
Creative Space for
Black Imagination, you know.

556
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:05,874
-That's...
-Fletcher.

557
00:30:06,008 --> 00:30:07,575
Oh, my God.

558
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:08,911
Thank you.

559
00:30:09,044 --> 00:30:10,645
What the hell is this place?

560
00:30:10,778 --> 00:30:13,414
This is my studio gallery.

561
00:30:13,548 --> 00:30:14,817
I'm an artiste now.

562
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,584
Please, you ain't
no damn artist.

563
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,122
-What do you guys want?
-Captain Howard.

564
00:30:21,255 --> 00:30:23,324
Yeah, I was sorry to hear
what happened to him.

565
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:24,927
He helped turn my life around.

566
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,829
He told us to talk to you.

567
00:30:26,962 --> 00:30:28,262
Okay. Talk to me.

568
00:30:28,396 --> 00:30:30,398
I just talked to you.

569
00:30:30,531 --> 00:30:31,799
Then say what
you're supposed to say.

570
00:30:31,934 --> 00:30:33,601
-I said what I'm supposed
to say. -You didn't.

571
00:30:33,735 --> 00:30:34,903
Then tell me what
I'm supposed to say.

572
00:30:35,037 --> 00:30:36,471
I've said all I can say.

573
00:30:36,604 --> 00:30:38,606
You fucking with us, beanstalk.

574
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,674
Marcus!

575
00:30:39,808 --> 00:30:41,342
Come on.

576
00:30:41,476 --> 00:30:43,645
Captain Howard saved my life.
I'm not messing this up.

577
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:45,713
I can't say
what I supposed to say

578
00:30:45,848 --> 00:30:48,182
until you say
what you supposed to say.

579
00:30:48,316 --> 00:30:50,151
Fletcher, just tell us
what you supposed to tell us.

580
00:30:50,284 --> 00:30:51,486
Dumbasses. Look.

581
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:54,622
Captain Howard
was onto something big.

582
00:30:54,756 --> 00:30:57,026
He didn't trust that you
dumb fucks would figure it out,

583
00:30:57,158 --> 00:30:59,028
so he contacted me.

584
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,330
Because you're stupid
and I'm a genius.

585
00:31:02,463 --> 00:31:05,968
So I protected the information
in something.

586
00:31:08,636 --> 00:31:11,739
In something beautiful.

587
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,446
Flex your face one more time.
Flex it again!

588
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:21,349
I will blow
your fucking head off.

589
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:24,153
Would you stop? Come on.

590
00:31:25,154 --> 00:31:28,756
In something
that will live forever.

591
00:31:33,862 --> 00:31:35,363
Did you shoot him?

592
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:37,565
I don't think so.

593
00:31:47,843 --> 00:31:49,510
Freeze!

594
00:31:49,644 --> 00:31:51,646
Marcus. Marcus!

595
00:32:21,642 --> 00:32:23,277
You hit?

596
00:32:23,411 --> 00:32:25,346
Nah. Black jelly bean.

597
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,849
Nobody likes that shit.

598
00:32:32,353 --> 00:32:34,255
Whoa.

599
00:32:40,595 --> 00:32:42,296
Hey! Stop that stupid shit!

600
00:32:47,936 --> 00:32:49,570
I'm not fucking with you! Stop!

601
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,813
No! No, no!

602
00:32:57,946 --> 00:33:00,082
No! No!

603
00:33:11,526 --> 00:33:13,996
I don't give a fuck!

604
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:16,098
Marcus, stop! No!

605
00:33:44,126 --> 00:33:46,028
-What are you doing?!
-I got this!

606
00:33:46,161 --> 00:33:47,896
But you don't, though!

607
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,131
No. No!

608
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:52,000
Marcus!

609
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,039
Let's go! Let's move!

610
00:33:58,673 --> 00:34:00,441
Marcus!

611
00:34:03,946 --> 00:34:06,380
Burnett and Lowrey
are moving north on 11th.

612
00:34:28,971 --> 00:34:31,039
Miami PD! Go!

613
00:34:32,307 --> 00:34:34,076
What are you doing?!

614
00:34:34,209 --> 00:34:35,676
I'm fighting crime, baby.

615
00:34:35,811 --> 00:34:36,845
Freeze!

616
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,375
Mike!

617
00:35:24,592 --> 00:35:26,627
Have you ever had
a panic attack before?

618
00:35:26,761 --> 00:35:27,829
What?

619
00:35:27,963 --> 00:35:29,932
Ain't nobody have
no damn panic attack.

620
00:35:30,065 --> 00:35:31,666
You're at 165 over 90.

621
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:33,501
Sweaty, nauseous.

622
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:34,970
Look, there's no shame
in getting counseling.

623
00:35:35,103 --> 00:35:36,138
-All right. Thank you.
-Mike.

624
00:35:36,271 --> 00:35:37,239
Appreciate you, brother.

625
00:35:37,372 --> 00:35:38,739
Mike, let the man do his job.

626
00:35:38,874 --> 00:35:39,908
-What...
-Okay.

627
00:35:40,042 --> 00:35:41,276
Good... good job, man.

628
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,945
Hey, Mike.

629
00:35:43,078 --> 00:35:44,645
What the hell
you panicking about?

630
00:35:44,779 --> 00:35:46,081
I'm not speaking to you.

631
00:35:46,214 --> 00:35:47,548
What'd I do?

632
00:35:49,918 --> 00:35:50,986
You two all right?

633
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,121
Mike had a panic attack.

634
00:35:53,255 --> 00:35:55,257
He didn't. Mike is fine.

635
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,524
What happened?

636
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:58,293
Rita, you ain't gonna
believe this shit,

637
00:35:58,427 --> 00:35:59,928
-but we got a text from...
-A tip.

638
00:36:00,062 --> 00:36:03,932
We got a tip that Fletcher
had violated his parole,

639
00:36:04,066 --> 00:36:05,800
so we came down here, and...

640
00:36:05,934 --> 00:36:09,004
obviously, he was into some
shit he ain't have no business.

641
00:36:09,137 --> 00:36:10,305
Is that true, Marcus?

642
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:12,573
Uh, um...

643
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:17,245
You know, well, you know, I...
I was with Mike.

644
00:36:18,546 --> 00:36:22,217
How could you, of all people,
think Captain Howard was dirty?

645
00:36:22,351 --> 00:36:25,153
I don't want this to be true,
but it would benefit all of us

646
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:27,755
to do our jobs
and follow the evidence.

647
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:29,790
And you think
he was stupid enough

648
00:36:29,925 --> 00:36:32,361
to put accounts
in his own name?

649
00:36:32,493 --> 00:36:34,896
-He's being framed.
-By who?

650
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,764
That's what we're trying
to find out.

651
00:36:36,898 --> 00:36:38,499
Rita, come on,
you're smarter than this.

652
00:36:38,632 --> 00:36:42,170
Michael, please do not forget
you're talking to your boss.

653
00:36:42,304 --> 00:36:44,538
I'm trying to protect you here.

654
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:47,109
I got no footage
for a two-block radius.

655
00:36:47,242 --> 00:36:48,642
What?

656
00:36:48,776 --> 00:36:51,113
They must have killed all CCTV,
all security cams.

657
00:36:51,246 --> 00:36:52,513
I got nothing.

658
00:36:52,646 --> 00:36:55,750
At least they ain't
film your panic attack.

659
00:36:57,618 --> 00:36:59,087
Hey, guys.

660
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:02,224
-You had a panic attack?
-No.

661
00:37:02,357 --> 00:37:04,059
If you want, I can recommend
a good counselor.

662
00:37:04,192 --> 00:37:05,360
I'm good, Dorn. Thanks.

663
00:37:05,494 --> 00:37:09,364
Look, I shot this,
went frame by frame.

664
00:37:09,498 --> 00:37:10,564
Check it out.

665
00:37:10,698 --> 00:37:12,566
All right, not here.

666
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:15,003
-Dorn, shut it down.
-Yeah.

667
00:37:15,137 --> 00:37:16,838
Hey. Let's go.

668
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:20,574
So, what is this?

669
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:21,977
We're not exactly sure.

670
00:37:23,812 --> 00:37:24,946
-Whoa.
-Wow.

671
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,082
There you go. There you go.

672
00:37:27,215 --> 00:37:28,850
All right, you fucks.

673
00:37:28,984 --> 00:37:32,087
Now that I know it's you,
here it is.

674
00:37:33,188 --> 00:37:35,424
I don't know how high up
it goes,

675
00:37:35,556 --> 00:37:38,360
but there's corrupt officials
on our side,

676
00:37:38,493 --> 00:37:40,062
and they're working
with the cartel.

677
00:37:40,195 --> 00:37:43,231
This all started smelling funny
about nine years ago.

678
00:37:43,365 --> 00:37:46,034
That shipment of coke we were
about to raid went missing.

679
00:37:46,168 --> 00:37:48,669
You know, I-I kept getting
shut down from above.

680
00:37:48,804 --> 00:37:52,874
So I... I pulled Sanchez
and Ruiz out of retirement.

681
00:37:53,008 --> 00:37:55,544
I had 'em working
on the outside, you know?

682
00:37:55,676 --> 00:37:58,146
They were killed in a car crash
a week later.

683
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,881
That shook me up.

684
00:38:00,015 --> 00:38:02,583
And it's why I never
brought you two in.

685
00:38:02,716 --> 00:38:04,585
Well, shame on me for worrying
about your asses

686
00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:06,488
when you could've saved mine.

687
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,722
But now it's up to you.

688
00:38:08,857 --> 00:38:11,860
Remember the bust back in 2003?

689
00:38:11,993 --> 00:38:15,397
314 pounds of ecstasy?

690
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:19,301
Well, I held on to the
storage unit, off the books.

691
00:38:19,434 --> 00:38:21,369
That's where
the real files are.

692
00:38:21,503 --> 00:38:23,038
Everything you need
to exterminate

693
00:38:23,171 --> 00:38:25,040
these rat fucks, it's in there.

694
00:38:25,173 --> 00:38:27,509
You're gonna have to finish
what I couldn't.

695
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:29,111
Please.

696
00:38:29,244 --> 00:38:31,146
Please, boys.

697
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:33,148
You're my last hope.

698
00:38:36,151 --> 00:38:38,920
2003, um...

699
00:38:39,054 --> 00:38:41,655
that was the-the Haitian,
Zoe Pound.

700
00:38:44,392 --> 00:38:46,128
Where was their storage locker?

701
00:38:46,261 --> 00:38:48,563
I have no idea. All right.

702
00:38:48,696 --> 00:38:50,565
We need you guys to go down
to the station

703
00:38:50,698 --> 00:38:52,100
and pull
our original case files.

704
00:38:52,234 --> 00:38:53,634
That'll tell us
where the locker is.

705
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:55,303
Do it quietly and be careful.

706
00:38:55,437 --> 00:38:57,339
We don't know who we can trust.

707
00:38:57,472 --> 00:38:59,341
Shit, this is heavy, man.

708
00:38:59,474 --> 00:39:00,509
Um...

709
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:02,110
I just got something
important to say.

710
00:39:02,244 --> 00:39:04,146
I'm just gonna come out
with it, clear the air.

711
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:08,116
Uh, the rat is not me, so...

712
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,051
Thanks for that, Dorn.

713
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,687
I feel safer.

714
00:40:52,387 --> 00:40:54,788
They just tried to kill my son

715
00:40:54,923 --> 00:40:58,093
because Armando can prove that
Captain Howard was innocent.

716
00:40:58,226 --> 00:41:00,262
Cap was onto
these dirty players.

717
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:01,730
Armando told you that?

718
00:41:01,863 --> 00:41:04,633
Yes. It's the reason they
wanted Captain Howard dead.

719
00:41:04,765 --> 00:41:07,335
Armando can I.D. the guy
that ordered the hit on Cap.

720
00:41:07,469 --> 00:41:08,503
He have a name?

721
00:41:09,537 --> 00:41:10,505
No.

722
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:11,772
But a face.

723
00:41:13,241 --> 00:41:15,310
Listen, I know y'all
can do this, all right?

724
00:41:15,443 --> 00:41:18,213
Just transfer Armando.
Get him to Miami.

725
00:41:18,346 --> 00:41:20,081
Get him to a secure location.

726
00:41:20,215 --> 00:41:22,117
We'll-we'll debrief him.
We'll get his testimony.

727
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,452
We'll get some pictures
in front of him.

728
00:41:24,586 --> 00:41:25,720
But please do it now.

729
00:41:25,854 --> 00:41:27,322
These guys are trying
to cover their asses,

730
00:41:27,455 --> 00:41:29,491
and they are not gonna stop.

731
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,261
Do it for Captain Howard.

732
00:41:35,063 --> 00:41:37,365
Look, the evidence
against Captain Howard

733
00:41:37,499 --> 00:41:39,367
is overwhelming.

734
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:41,970
If I'm doing this,
I'm doing it for you.

735
00:41:44,973 --> 00:41:47,509
All right.
Let's transfer Aretas.

736
00:41:47,642 --> 00:41:49,077
You'll accompany him,

737
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,579
get him to igloo here in Miami,
do a debrief.

738
00:41:51,713 --> 00:41:54,516
But I'm sticking my neck out
and I'm trusting you.

739
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,820
If he turns out to be bullshit,
then it's gonna be my ass.

740
00:41:58,953 --> 00:42:01,790
So... don't screw me, Mike.

741
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:05,827
All right.

742
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:09,364
Thank you. Thank you.

743
00:42:11,366 --> 00:42:12,801
Yeah?

744
00:42:12,934 --> 00:42:14,969
We found
Zoe Pound's storage unit.

745
00:42:15,103 --> 00:42:16,571
We'll go get the files,
then take them

746
00:42:16,705 --> 00:42:18,406
to my houseboat
for safekeeping.

747
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,841
All right. Stay on it.

748
00:42:19,974 --> 00:42:21,776
Let me know when you got it.

749
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:38,660
Please surrender your firearms.

750
00:42:38,793 --> 00:42:40,528
They will be returned to you
upon touchdown.

751
00:42:56,044 --> 00:42:57,212
You good?

752
00:42:58,213 --> 00:42:59,514
Never been better.

753
00:42:59,647 --> 00:43:02,050
It's about 45 minutes.

754
00:43:08,056 --> 00:43:10,091
Mike, I wasn't even
gonna tell you this,

755
00:43:10,225 --> 00:43:12,761
but in one of our previous
lifetimes together...

756
00:43:12,894 --> 00:43:14,195
Mm-hmm?

757
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:17,432
...you were a donkey,
and I owned you.

758
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,301
You were a stubborn ass, Mike.

759
00:43:20,435 --> 00:43:22,872
-Mm-hmm.
-You used to bite and spit.

760
00:43:23,004 --> 00:43:24,874
-You were nasty.
-Mm-hmm.

761
00:43:25,006 --> 00:43:28,443
But I-I was a terrible owner,
you know,

762
00:43:28,576 --> 00:43:30,678
-because I used to beat you.
-Mm-hmm.

763
00:43:30,813 --> 00:43:32,680
Because you wouldn't
listen for shit.

764
00:43:32,815 --> 00:43:36,084
And maybe I beat some kind
of shame into you, Mike.

765
00:43:36,217 --> 00:43:39,822
And now I realize
I was scarring your soul.

766
00:43:40,856 --> 00:43:41,891
You miss your nap?

767
00:43:43,558 --> 00:43:45,828
Mike, I'm trying
to apologize to you.

768
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,095
We don't have your blankie,

769
00:43:47,228 --> 00:43:49,164
but you could just
rest your eyes.

770
00:43:49,297 --> 00:43:51,666
That's exactly how you was
as a donkey.

771
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,135
-Okay. I get it.
-That's that shit there.

772
00:43:54,269 --> 00:43:55,871
You need some help
with your seat belt?

773
00:43:56,004 --> 00:43:57,439
No, donkey.

774
00:44:00,074 --> 00:44:01,376
Hey.

775
00:44:01,509 --> 00:44:03,645
Bryant, this is Bronson.

776
00:44:03,778 --> 00:44:05,915
The other guys
are on turnaround.

777
00:44:06,047 --> 00:44:07,482
Take a seat.

778
00:44:29,237 --> 00:44:30,806
What's up?

779
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:48,858
Read the lines.

780
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,558
"U.S. Marshal flight 724.

781
00:44:50,692 --> 00:44:52,060
"We have an emergency.

782
00:44:52,193 --> 00:44:53,661
"Our prisoner
has escaped custody

"they are hijacking the CH-47.

All ground units,
please respond."

789
00:45:18,653 --> 00:45:20,990
-Give me Lowrey's gun.
-Copy.

790
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:34,335
Go, go! Get Lowrey.

791
00:45:38,439 --> 00:45:40,976
Let's go!

792
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,702
We welcome the storm,
motherfuck...

793
00:46:51,046 --> 00:46:52,915
Get me out
of this fucking cage!

794
00:46:53,048 --> 00:46:55,149
Marcus!

795
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:58,653
Mike!

796
00:47:16,805 --> 00:47:19,374
-It's too heavy!
-Don't let go!

797
00:47:59,647 --> 00:48:01,315
Grab the stick!

798
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:05,954
Where the hell
you learn how to fly?

799
00:48:07,789 --> 00:48:09,825
I'm a drug dealer, man.
To the right!

800
00:48:53,601 --> 00:48:55,904
He was using my gun.

801
00:48:56,038 --> 00:48:58,372
How the hell did they get
on a federal transport?

802
00:48:59,373 --> 00:49:00,742
We need to split up.

803
00:49:00,876 --> 00:49:02,543
We're gonna stay together.

804
00:49:02,677 --> 00:49:04,412
Says who?

805
00:49:05,914 --> 00:49:07,515
I'm not asking you.

806
00:49:07,648 --> 00:49:09,450
I'm telling you.
We're staying together.

807
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:11,786
-Fuck out of my way.
-Hey. Where...

808
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,354
-Hey! Hey!
-Get the fuck off me.

809
00:49:13,488 --> 00:49:15,224
-Hey! Hey!
-Listen!

810
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:18,227
Look, you are the only person

811
00:49:18,359 --> 00:49:20,661
who can identify
whoever is doing this.

812
00:49:20,795 --> 00:49:23,431
The only way that
any of us stays alive

813
00:49:23,564 --> 00:49:25,934
is if we get them
before they get us.

814
00:49:26,068 --> 00:49:28,469
There's no us. There is no us!

815
00:49:28,603 --> 00:49:30,005
Damn.

816
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:32,107
That Lowrey DNA is a bitch.

817
00:49:32,241 --> 00:49:34,109
Y'all some
strong motherfuckers.

818
00:49:35,443 --> 00:49:39,915
Okay. Now, look,
everybody unflex on three.

819
00:49:40,048 --> 00:49:41,783
One. Two.

820
00:49:42,784 --> 00:49:44,552
There you go.

821
00:49:44,685 --> 00:49:48,056
Captain Howard left us files

822
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,892
that's gonna tell us
who's doing this.

823
00:49:50,025 --> 00:49:51,994
Dorn has them.

824
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,996
We just have to get back
to Miami.

825
00:49:55,931 --> 00:49:57,833
You better not slow me down.

826
00:49:59,268 --> 00:50:01,136
Lose your phones.

827
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:03,471
You keep up with me,
or I leave you in the dirt.

828
00:50:04,472 --> 00:50:05,874
You're in my world now.

829
00:50:18,821 --> 00:50:20,189
Hey, Mike.

830
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:22,090
Look, we got to think
about this.

831
00:50:22,224 --> 00:50:23,959
I know you want to move
with him,

832
00:50:24,092 --> 00:50:26,327
you know,
because he's your "son."

833
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,997
Whoa. Whoa.
Don't air-quote that.

834
00:50:29,131 --> 00:50:30,565
No, I-I didn't. I'm just saying

835
00:50:30,698 --> 00:50:32,201
I know why you trying
to protect him--

836
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:33,467
'cause he "family."

837
00:50:33,601 --> 00:50:34,702
Hey.

838
00:50:34,837 --> 00:50:36,805
Moving the air quotes
down to your hips

839
00:50:36,939 --> 00:50:38,807
doesn't un-air-quote them.

840
00:50:38,941 --> 00:50:40,508
Just-just say he's my son.

841
00:50:40,641 --> 00:50:42,643
-He's your son.
-No, no.

842
00:50:42,777 --> 00:50:45,113
Palms up is like
you trying to say,

843
00:50:45,247 --> 00:50:46,949
oh, he's not really my son.

844
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:48,884
Oh.

845
00:50:49,017 --> 00:50:50,853
Well, your son's getting away.

846
00:50:50,986 --> 00:50:52,453
Shit.

847
00:51:00,461 --> 00:51:02,396
If your men
are on some kind of op,

848
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:03,899
you might want to pull us in.

849
00:51:04,032 --> 00:51:05,766
Otherwise, it doesn't
look good for them.

850
00:51:05,901 --> 00:51:07,202
Yeah.

851
00:51:08,203 --> 00:51:09,905
-Judy.
-You I.D. the bodies?

852
00:51:10,038 --> 00:51:12,241
Roger.
We got three unaccounted for:

853
00:51:12,373 --> 00:51:15,376
Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas.

854
00:51:15,509 --> 00:51:16,879
Motherfuckers.

855
00:51:17,012 --> 00:51:19,547
Fucking... Shit.

856
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,149
All right. Listen up!

857
00:51:21,283 --> 00:51:25,620
We have three suspects,
armed and dangerous, out there.

858
00:51:25,753 --> 00:51:28,090
And I want them back.

859
00:51:28,223 --> 00:51:30,391
Let's go.

860
00:51:30,524 --> 00:51:31,894
Hold on. Judy.

861
00:51:32,027 --> 00:51:33,761
Three suspects?

862
00:51:33,896 --> 00:51:36,731
What do you think
is happening here?

863
00:51:36,865 --> 00:51:39,134
Wh-What do you think?

864
00:51:39,268 --> 00:51:41,203
Play the audio.

865
00:51:41,336 --> 00:51:42,938
U.S. Marshal flight 724.

866
00:51:43,071 --> 00:51:44,705
We have an emergency.

867
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,008
Our prisoner
has escaped custody

868
00:51:46,141 --> 00:51:49,211
with the aid of Miami PD--
Lowrey and Burnett.

869
00:51:49,344 --> 00:51:50,745
There are officers down.
Mayday. Mayday.

870
00:51:50,879 --> 00:51:52,948
Come on, you can't
possibly believe

871
00:51:53,081 --> 00:51:54,749
Mike and Marcus would do this.

872
00:51:54,883 --> 00:51:56,118
Nah, you said it.

873
00:51:56,251 --> 00:51:58,653
Lowrey was obsessed with
getting his son out of prison.

874
00:51:58,786 --> 00:52:00,822
Slow down, Judy.

875
00:52:00,956 --> 00:52:02,824
This isn't Miami, Secada.

876
00:52:02,958 --> 00:52:04,226
These are my fugitives,

877
00:52:04,359 --> 00:52:06,427
and right now the whole world
is my jurisdiction.

878
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,628
You've known them
your whole life.

879
00:52:07,762 --> 00:52:08,931
How can you even suggest...

880
00:52:09,064 --> 00:52:12,200
Do I think that
Mike and Marcus planned this?

881
00:52:12,334 --> 00:52:13,601
Probably not.

882
00:52:13,734 --> 00:52:15,237
But people do things
they wouldn't normally do

883
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:16,405
when family's involved.

884
00:52:16,537 --> 00:52:18,807
In my experience,
innocent men don't run.

885
00:52:18,941 --> 00:52:20,309
Can we stop and think before...

886
00:52:20,441 --> 00:52:22,476
Are you capable
of doing your job?

887
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:24,112
'Cause I need to move on.

888
00:52:29,583 --> 00:52:31,153
They survived.

889
00:52:31,286 --> 00:52:32,753
The fuck you mean,
they survived?

890
00:52:32,888 --> 00:52:34,156
No bodies on site.

891
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:36,490
U.S. Marshals are treating it
as a manhunt.

892
00:52:37,758 --> 00:52:40,829
These guys just refuse to die.

893
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:43,497
They're wanted men.

894
00:52:43,631 --> 00:52:46,667
Law enforcement
and media are our friends now.

895
00:52:46,801 --> 00:52:48,804
A manhunt for three fugitives

896
00:52:48,937 --> 00:52:50,806
is sending shock waves
across South Florida.

897
00:52:50,939 --> 00:52:52,274
Ballistic reports
have matched the bullets

898
00:52:52,407 --> 00:52:53,507
recovered from
the bodies at the...

899
00:52:53,641 --> 00:52:55,143
Are you planning
on dropping out

900
00:52:55,277 --> 00:52:57,179
of the mayor's race
in light of the recent events?

901
00:52:57,312 --> 00:52:59,014
The manhunt
is currently underway.

902
00:52:59,147 --> 00:53:01,649
The FBI is assisting
U.S. Marshals

903
00:53:01,782 --> 00:53:04,119
in bringing these men in.

904
00:53:04,252 --> 00:53:05,988
Lowrey, Burnett and Aretas

905
00:53:06,121 --> 00:53:08,556
should be considered
armed and dangerous.

906
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:11,193
These are individuals
who have killed

907
00:53:11,326 --> 00:53:12,828
fellow law enforcement
professionals.

908
00:53:12,961 --> 00:53:16,764
If you see something,
say something.

909
00:53:16,898 --> 00:53:19,368
Put a bounty on the streets.

910
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,502
Get it
to every gang in the city

911
00:53:21,635 --> 00:53:24,139
and let them fight for it.

912
00:53:25,807 --> 00:53:27,109
Five mil.

913
00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:30,544
Let's go get
these motherfuckers.

914
00:53:39,553 --> 00:53:42,257
The universe
is crazy, ain't it?

915
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:44,359
Look at us.

916
00:53:44,493 --> 00:53:46,794
I bet none of us thought
when we woke up today

917
00:53:46,928 --> 00:53:49,064
this is where we'd be.

918
00:53:49,197 --> 00:53:50,966
You out of jail.

919
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:53,567
We going to jail.

920
00:53:53,701 --> 00:53:55,636
This shit is special.

921
00:53:57,339 --> 00:54:00,942
Mike, is there anything you
would like to say to Armando?

922
00:54:01,076 --> 00:54:03,045
Fuck you talking to me
like that? No.

923
00:54:03,178 --> 00:54:04,446
Mike, this is a moment.

924
00:54:04,578 --> 00:54:06,915
Express with your son.

925
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:16,791
I'm sorry.

926
00:54:16,925 --> 00:54:18,493
That's what I'm talk...

927
00:54:18,626 --> 00:54:19,995
That's what I'm talking...

928
00:54:20,128 --> 00:54:21,196
For what?

929
00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:22,596
For everything, man.

930
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:27,169
Seems like bad shit happens
to anybody I love, so...

931
00:54:27,302 --> 00:54:29,337
starting to think
maybe I'm cursed.

932
00:54:29,471 --> 00:54:31,506
I just feel like...

933
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:33,241
maybe I cursed you.

934
00:54:35,277 --> 00:54:36,812
You ain't fucking curse me.

935
00:54:36,945 --> 00:54:39,381
Bad shit happens to everybody.

936
00:54:40,382 --> 00:54:41,983
Ain't always about you.

937
00:54:43,018 --> 00:54:44,252
Hey, Armando.

938
00:54:45,387 --> 00:54:46,955
I don't know
if I told you this,

939
00:54:47,089 --> 00:54:48,756
but I died
a couple of weeks ago.

940
00:54:50,192 --> 00:54:51,759
-Sorry to hear about that.
-Oh, no.

941
00:54:51,893 --> 00:54:54,129
Best thing
that ever happened to me.

942
00:54:54,262 --> 00:54:55,564
Shit's wild.

943
00:54:55,696 --> 00:54:57,698
But y'all...

944
00:54:57,833 --> 00:54:59,733
y'all the reason I came back.

945
00:54:59,868 --> 00:55:01,470
Hey.

946
00:55:01,602 --> 00:55:04,239
Everybody, bring it in.

947
00:55:04,372 --> 00:55:05,773
Come on, bring it in.

948
00:55:05,907 --> 00:55:06,942
Come on.

949
00:55:07,075 --> 00:55:08,977
-Dude.
-Bring...

950
00:55:09,111 --> 00:55:11,113
There you go, Armando.

951
00:55:12,047 --> 00:55:13,315
There you go. There you...

952
00:55:13,448 --> 00:55:16,118
Y'all are some terrible
fucking fugitives.

953
00:55:19,354 --> 00:55:21,156
So, what-what are you,
fucking Marcus Winfrey?

954
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:22,457
-What?
-What you... See?

955
00:55:22,591 --> 00:55:23,757
-I'm just trying...
-You making us look soft,

956
00:55:23,892 --> 00:55:25,560
like we don't know
how to be on the run.

957
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,809
We got to get you out of this.

958
00:55:41,775 --> 00:55:43,211
Hey.

959
00:55:43,345 --> 00:55:44,613
That boy hardheaded.

960
00:55:44,745 --> 00:55:46,047
Chip off the old block.

961
00:56:05,867 --> 00:56:08,802
Well, what we got here?

962
00:56:10,105 --> 00:56:12,140
Hey, Cain, come take
a look at this!

963
00:56:12,274 --> 00:56:14,509
What are you boys doing?

964
00:56:14,643 --> 00:56:16,011
"Boys"?

965
00:56:16,144 --> 00:56:17,245
Are y'all stealing our clothes?

966
00:56:17,379 --> 00:56:18,480
Looks like it.

967
00:56:18,613 --> 00:56:20,248
Fucking racism.

968
00:56:21,283 --> 00:56:23,018
Y'all think
just because we Black

969
00:56:23,151 --> 00:56:24,186
we stealing your shit?

970
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,521
Now, these are
my own Black clothes

971
00:56:26,655 --> 00:56:31,059
that I put on today
from my own Black closet.

972
00:56:31,193 --> 00:56:32,294
-Marcus.
-What?

973
00:56:32,427 --> 00:56:33,562
Look at your shirt.

974
00:56:38,633 --> 00:56:40,669
Hey, man.

975
00:56:40,801 --> 00:56:42,404
How'd this get
in my Black closet?

976
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:46,274
Why don't you boys sing us
a little Reba song?

977
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:49,945
-Uh, Reba?
-Reba?

978
00:56:50,078 --> 00:56:52,013
Oh, yeah.

979
00:56:52,147 --> 00:56:54,382
-Oh, please.
-Uh... which...

980
00:56:54,516 --> 00:56:56,851
That's, um, 'cause he put...

981
00:56:56,985 --> 00:56:59,020
Whi-Which one?
Which y'all... Which one?

982
00:56:59,154 --> 00:57:01,056
Sing your favorite.

983
00:57:01,189 --> 00:57:02,891
Oh, she got plenty
of them, um...

984
00:57:03,024 --> 00:57:04,725
-'Cause she got hits.
-Yeah, she got hits.

985
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:06,228
-Was it the up-tempo song?
-Yeah, yeah, remember the one?

986
00:57:06,361 --> 00:57:07,362
You know, where she...
or the...

987
00:57:07,495 --> 00:57:08,530
-or-or the slow jam?
-Uh...

988
00:57:08,663 --> 00:57:11,066
-It was the slow one, man.
-Oh, okay, uh...

989
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:12,601
You hurt me...

990
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:14,269
Yes, 'cause she was hurt.
She was, yeah, uh...

991
00:57:14,402 --> 00:57:16,705
Yes, yes.

992
00:57:19,274 --> 00:57:20,141
I'm a...

993
00:57:20,275 --> 00:57:21,309
-I'm a woman.
-I'm a woman.

994
00:57:21,443 --> 00:57:22,711
-I'm a strong Black wo...
-A strong...

995
00:57:22,844 --> 00:57:24,512
Woman, yeah, 'cause

996
00:57:24,646 --> 00:57:26,047
-she not Black, but...
-Yeah, she... But...

997
00:57:28,049 --> 00:57:29,918
Yeah. And, um, um...

998
00:57:31,853 --> 00:57:33,754
Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

999
00:57:33,888 --> 00:57:36,191
That ain't no Reba song.

1000
00:57:37,092 --> 00:57:38,460
It's from her mixtape.

1001
00:57:47,135 --> 00:57:48,570
Goddamn it!

1002
00:57:50,605 --> 00:57:53,141
We're sorry!
We'll bring it back!

1003
00:57:53,275 --> 00:57:55,543
We're not stealing your shit
because we Black!

1004
00:58:09,724 --> 00:58:11,660
Did you ever love her?

1005
00:58:13,561 --> 00:58:14,863
What?

1006
00:58:14,996 --> 00:58:17,666
My mother. You ever love her?

1007
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:20,335
He's expressing.

1008
00:58:22,304 --> 00:58:23,772
I definitely loved her.

1009
00:58:23,905 --> 00:58:26,007
And then you sold her out.

1010
00:58:26,975 --> 00:58:28,243
I made some mistakes.

1011
00:58:28,376 --> 00:58:29,844
Like me.

1012
00:58:29,978 --> 00:58:31,079
Now, you know that is not
what I was trying...

1013
00:58:31,212 --> 00:58:33,348
Now, wait a damn minute,
Armando.

1014
00:58:33,481 --> 00:58:35,283
He's trying to make up for it.

1015
00:58:35,417 --> 00:58:37,085
He don't owe you a damn thing.

1016
00:58:37,218 --> 00:58:38,853
All right, ho-hold on.
Hold on, Marcus.

1017
00:58:38,987 --> 00:58:40,588
You're-you're just...
you're being aggressive.

1018
00:58:40,722 --> 00:58:41,856
I've been a dad a long time.

1019
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:43,625
He needs to hear this, Mike.

1020
00:58:43,758 --> 00:58:45,360
He needs some tough-ass love.

1021
00:58:45,493 --> 00:58:49,731
Armando, maybe he does
owe you something, okay?

1022
00:58:49,864 --> 00:58:51,666
Your mom being deceived by him,

1023
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,335
you being born in prison,

1024
00:58:53,468 --> 00:58:55,570
in a web of lies

1025
00:58:55,704 --> 00:59:00,175
that turned your ass into
a stone-cold fucking killer.

1026
00:59:01,509 --> 00:59:03,645
Yeah. You're a killer.

1027
00:59:04,746 --> 00:59:07,817
But this man, through it all,

1028
00:59:07,949 --> 00:59:10,352
has been nothing but solid.

1029
00:59:12,253 --> 00:59:14,556
That's some father-of-the-year
shit right there.

1030
00:59:14,689 --> 00:59:16,091
-Is it?
-Yeah.

1031
00:59:19,494 --> 00:59:21,596
Your wack-ass parenting
broke the truck.

1032
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:22,897
My bad.

1033
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:26,401
Yeah, nah, that's dead.

1034
00:59:26,534 --> 00:59:27,869
We're not far from Tabitha's.

1035
00:59:28,002 --> 00:59:30,071
Nah, Mike.
You know that woman's crazy.

1036
00:59:30,205 --> 00:59:31,673
Yeah, but she likes me.

1037
00:59:31,807 --> 00:59:33,875
I don't think she likes you
as much as you think.

1038
00:59:34,008 --> 00:59:35,577
The Pony's about
two miles from here.

1039
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:36,878
What's The Pony?

1040
00:59:47,422 --> 00:59:49,859
I need my Instagram.
I need my Friendster.

1041
00:59:50,024 --> 00:59:51,526
I need more sex.

1042
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:53,795
I need more men in this club.

1043
00:59:53,928 --> 00:59:55,029
You all look beautiful.

1044
00:59:55,163 --> 00:59:57,065
Now, get back to work.

1045
00:59:57,198 --> 00:59:59,835
Mike Lowrey. Damn.

1046
00:59:59,968 --> 01:00:01,069
What up, Tabitha?

1047
01:00:03,571 --> 01:00:04,672
So y'all in trouble, huh?

1048
01:00:04,807 --> 01:00:06,876
Yeah, uh, we need some help.
Um...

1049
01:00:07,008 --> 01:00:08,844
-Well, we need some clothes.
-No shit.

1050
01:00:08,977 --> 01:00:11,179
-A ride and some phones.
-Mm. Yeah.

1051
01:00:11,312 --> 01:00:12,547
Yeah. Guns, too.

1052
01:00:13,581 --> 01:00:15,617
Uh, that's my son.
That's Armando.

1053
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:17,385
You got you
a little Spanish son?

1054
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:19,621
Yeah.
Yeah, it's a long story.

1055
01:00:19,754 --> 01:00:21,556
Um, can you hook us up?

1056
01:00:22,557 --> 01:00:25,059
I mean, I got all that,
but what you gonna do for me?

1057
01:00:25,193 --> 01:00:27,061
What you mean?
We good for that.

1058
01:00:27,195 --> 01:00:28,898
You were.

1059
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:31,433
But you guys
are men on the run now, so...

1060
01:00:31,566 --> 01:00:32,902
Well, what you need?

1061
01:00:33,034 --> 01:00:35,036
-What I need?
-Mm-hmm.

1062
01:00:36,104 --> 01:00:37,939
I need you to eat this pussy.

1063
01:00:41,543 --> 01:00:42,977
I'm not doing that, all right?

1064
01:00:43,111 --> 01:00:44,446
Whoa. Hold on, Mike.

1065
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:46,314
Hold on. Think about this.

1066
01:00:46,448 --> 01:00:49,150
Now, you say
guns and phones, right?

1067
01:00:49,284 --> 01:00:50,920
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay, well, look,

1068
01:00:51,052 --> 01:00:53,288
-you know Mike's a married man.
-So?

1069
01:00:53,421 --> 01:00:56,024
So he's gonna need
some plausible deniability.

1070
01:00:56,157 --> 01:01:00,094
So I'm-a have you lay down
and, uh, stick out your tongue,

1071
01:01:00,228 --> 01:01:01,931
and you gonna
have to do the rest.

1072
01:01:02,063 --> 01:01:03,631
I can fuck with that.

1073
01:01:03,765 --> 01:01:06,334
-Oh, yeah. Go on and lay down.
-No, Marcus.

1074
01:01:06,468 --> 01:01:08,938
All you got to do
is close your eyes, Mike.

1075
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:11,406
-No. -Ooh, I'm-a need
pictures, okay?

1076
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:12,974
-You know how to take pictures,
right? -Tabitha, hey.

1077
01:01:13,107 --> 01:01:14,576
-What?
-We don't have a lot of time.

1078
01:01:14,709 --> 01:01:15,977
I need you to stop
fucking around.

1079
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:17,512
Oh, I'm not fucking around.

1080
01:01:17,645 --> 01:01:18,980
All right. Hey, let's go.

1081
01:01:19,113 --> 01:01:20,215
W-Wait. Hold up.

1082
01:01:20,348 --> 01:01:22,818
Sit your
motherfucking ass down.

1083
01:01:22,952 --> 01:01:24,319
Hey, Tabitha,
what is you doing?

1084
01:01:24,452 --> 01:01:26,187
What is you doing?
Sit your married ass down!

1085
01:01:26,321 --> 01:01:28,156
You get y'all asses down, too!

1086
01:01:28,289 --> 01:01:30,058
-Shit.
-Everybody, sit down!

1087
01:01:30,191 --> 01:01:32,126
Hey, I got the bad boys
right here.

1088
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:33,294
Let's get that money.

1089
01:01:33,428 --> 01:01:35,865
-Hey, Tab.
-Shut the fuck up.

1090
01:01:35,997 --> 01:01:38,366
H-Hold up. I'm confused.

1091
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:40,201
You didn't want him
to licky-licky?

1092
01:01:40,335 --> 01:01:42,470
There's a $5 million bounty
on your head.

1093
01:01:42,604 --> 01:01:44,539
I need that money.
I was just stalling.

1094
01:01:44,672 --> 01:01:46,140
That's-that's cold.

1095
01:01:46,274 --> 01:01:47,775
He almost did that shit.

1096
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:49,344
He did not, Marcus.

1097
01:01:49,477 --> 01:01:51,246
-I told you she didn't
like you. -

1098
01:01:51,379 --> 01:01:52,747
Get the fuck up.

1099
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,055
The bounty is dead or alive.

1100
01:02:01,189 --> 01:02:02,657
Don't be stupid.

1101
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,462
Hey, Armando.

1102
01:02:07,595 --> 01:02:10,665
If you live,
I'll let you...

1103
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:12,001
What?

1104
01:02:12,133 --> 01:02:14,669
I said, if you live,
motherfucker, holla at me!

1105
01:02:16,638 --> 01:02:17,672
He was kind of cute.

1106
01:02:17,806 --> 01:02:19,374
Nah.

1107
01:02:21,242 --> 01:02:22,410
We got a tip.

1108
01:02:23,411 --> 01:02:25,113
Positive I.D. on our fugitives.

1109
01:02:25,246 --> 01:02:27,682
Let's do this.

1110
01:02:31,921 --> 01:02:35,490
Ooh. Mike, I'm about
to make my move.

1111
01:02:35,623 --> 01:02:37,125
Oh, no, the fuck you're not.

1112
01:02:37,258 --> 01:02:38,726
You 'bout to go wherever
these men are taking us.

1113
01:02:38,861 --> 01:02:40,061
Oh, I'm not going.

1114
01:02:40,194 --> 01:02:41,729
Now, I'll take
the three in the front.

1115
01:02:41,864 --> 01:02:43,164
You take the six in the back.

1116
01:02:43,298 --> 01:02:45,901
Marcus, we do not have
any weapons.

1117
01:02:46,035 --> 01:02:49,571
-In five, four, three...
-Marcus.

1118
01:03:10,491 --> 01:03:12,727
Ah, shit. This motherfucker.

1119
01:03:15,496 --> 01:03:16,764
Hey, yo, Mike.

1120
01:03:16,899 --> 01:03:19,367
Ain't no fun when the rabbit
got the gun, huh?

1121
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:20,768
Wait, you know this guy?

1122
01:03:20,903 --> 01:03:22,972
Yeah, I hit him with a hammer
a couple years ago.

1123
01:03:23,104 --> 01:03:25,074
You think I forgot about
that fucking ho shit

1124
01:03:25,206 --> 01:03:27,141
you pulled off
at Manny's Prime Rib?

1125
01:03:27,275 --> 01:03:29,143
How the fuck did I let
you two catch me?

1126
01:03:29,277 --> 01:03:31,112
Mike, I want my five million.

1127
01:03:31,245 --> 01:03:32,647
Marcus!

1128
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:35,516
You see I got the fam with me--
the streets!

1129
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:38,653
We can do this nice and easy
or we can go to war.

1130
01:03:38,786 --> 01:03:40,755
'Cause I'm fucking war-ready!

1131
01:03:40,889 --> 01:03:42,490
What are you doing?

1132
01:03:44,258 --> 01:03:46,394
No!

1133
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:57,806
Go, go, go, go!

1134
01:04:02,111 --> 01:04:04,312
Back up! Back up! Back up!

1135
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:10,618
No! No!

1136
01:04:10,752 --> 01:04:13,788
Windshield wiper fluid
is flammable!

1137
01:04:13,922 --> 01:04:15,623
How the hell am I supposed
to know that?

1138
01:04:15,757 --> 01:04:17,258
I ain't no damn scientist.

1139
01:04:22,965 --> 01:04:24,332
Everybody, relax.

1140
01:04:24,465 --> 01:04:26,135
The fire's on the outside.

1141
01:04:28,937 --> 01:04:29,972
Oh, shit.

1142
01:04:30,105 --> 01:04:31,907
Now it's on the inside.

1143
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:37,311
Shit! Okay.

1144
01:04:38,646 --> 01:04:40,515
Okay.

1145
01:05:00,301 --> 01:05:01,502
Shit!

1146
01:05:10,045 --> 01:05:12,881
Everybody, out! Everybody, out!

1147
01:05:40,209 --> 01:05:42,077
Shit.

1148
01:05:54,355 --> 01:05:56,225
Open the damn door!

1149
01:05:59,194 --> 01:06:01,329
We can feel you right
there, boy. Open the door.

1150
01:06:01,462 --> 01:06:02,663
Shit.

1151
01:06:09,138 --> 01:06:10,438
Hey.

1152
01:06:10,571 --> 01:06:12,841
-Open up, Muscle Milk.
-Come on, man.

1153
01:06:12,975 --> 01:06:14,709
-What the fuck is you doing?
-Nothing.

1154
01:06:14,843 --> 01:06:17,045
It's just not a great time
for me right now, guys.

1155
01:06:17,179 --> 01:06:18,546
It's not a great time
for us, either.

1156
01:06:18,679 --> 01:06:20,414
Okay, let's reconvene
in like an hour or so.

1157
01:06:20,548 --> 01:06:22,251
Babe, we're out of body wash.

1158
01:06:22,383 --> 01:06:25,053
-Whoa...
-Whoa! What the hell?

1159
01:06:25,187 --> 01:06:27,222
We found you guys.

1160
01:06:29,224 --> 01:06:30,758
We're in a relationship, okay?

1161
01:06:30,893 --> 01:06:32,426
-Oh, okay.
-All right, yeah, that's...

1162
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,462
Sneaking around
has been destroying me.

1163
01:06:34,595 --> 01:06:35,864
It started
about a couple months ago.

1164
01:06:35,998 --> 01:06:37,833
It will not affect
our professional lives.

1165
01:06:37,966 --> 01:06:39,700
Except for that one time
in that van.

1166
01:06:39,835 --> 01:06:42,537
-I am not sorry.
-Nothing to be sorry about.

1167
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:45,107
Yeah, you know,
I-I mean, people do that shit.

1168
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,241
Are you guys okay?

1169
01:06:46,374 --> 01:06:47,843
-Yeah, we're good.
-Oh.

1170
01:06:49,077 --> 01:06:50,145
What the fuck?

1171
01:06:50,279 --> 01:06:51,746
Okay. Whoa, whoa.

1172
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,249
Hey, Kelly, Kelly.

1173
01:06:54,382 --> 01:06:56,952
I asked you to wait outside
for a second.

1174
01:06:57,085 --> 01:06:59,587
All right. Kelly, he's with us.

1175
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:00,889
He can't be here.

1176
01:07:01,023 --> 01:07:02,858
This is my son Armando.

1177
01:07:02,991 --> 01:07:05,726
I know who he is, and
that's why he can't be here.

1178
01:07:05,861 --> 01:07:07,361
I trust you with my life, Mike,

1179
01:07:07,495 --> 01:07:09,397
but I sure as shit
don't trust him.

1180
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:10,698
I trust him.

1181
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:12,901
Then take him to your house.

1182
01:07:14,203 --> 01:07:15,204
Hey, Mike.

1183
01:07:15,336 --> 01:07:16,839
Uh, can I have a second
with her?

1184
01:07:16,972 --> 01:07:18,472
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Please.
-Okay. Hey, sweetie.

1185
01:07:18,606 --> 01:07:19,942
Relax. Relax.

1186
01:07:20,075 --> 01:07:21,509
Come here for a sec.
Come over here for a sec.

1187
01:07:21,642 --> 01:07:23,145
I asked you to wait outside.

1188
01:07:24,947 --> 01:07:26,547
We could both end up in jail.

1189
01:07:30,018 --> 01:07:31,586
Why don't we
give them a chance?

1190
01:07:31,719 --> 01:07:34,189
Yeah, give them a chance
to kill us all? Hmm?

1191
01:07:34,323 --> 01:07:36,591
This is
some dysfunctional shit.

1192
01:07:39,794 --> 01:07:41,196
-She's fine.
-All right.

1193
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:43,065
-She don't look fine.
-I'm fine.

1194
01:07:43,198 --> 01:07:44,166
Yes, you are.

1195
01:07:44,299 --> 01:07:46,500
-Hey. All right.
-The fuck you say?

1196
01:07:46,634 --> 01:07:48,636
-All right. All right.
-It's the language barrier.

1197
01:07:48,769 --> 01:07:50,138
It was English.

1198
01:07:50,272 --> 01:07:51,907
-Uh...
-It was definitely English.

1199
01:07:57,712 --> 01:07:58,847
Thanks for the drip.

1200
01:07:58,981 --> 01:08:00,481
Yeah.

1201
01:08:00,615 --> 01:08:02,017
Okay, we're aggregating
all the data.

1202
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:05,254
There's over a hundred hours
of video, 200 units of audio.

1203
01:08:05,386 --> 01:08:08,357
We're indexing all audio, video
and geo-located IP network data

1204
01:08:08,489 --> 01:08:11,559
to create a sight picture
and develop a target package.

1205
01:08:11,692 --> 01:08:13,728
Basically, you-you sifting
through all this shit to find

1206
01:08:13,862 --> 01:08:15,563
-the guilty motherfucker.
-Bingo.

1207
01:08:16,564 --> 01:08:17,765
Hey, Dorn.

1208
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:20,369
-Yeah. -Can you safely get me
into my Ring app?

1209
01:08:20,501 --> 01:08:22,037
-Yeah.
-I want to see my family.

1210
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:23,738
Yeah, we got
our own VPN and router.

1211
01:08:23,872 --> 01:08:26,674
-Uh, what's your username?
-Marcus37.

1212
01:08:26,808 --> 01:08:28,176
And password?

1213
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:30,279
Snickers89.

1214
01:08:37,386 --> 01:08:39,254
Almost home, baby.

1215
01:08:39,388 --> 01:08:40,322
Hey, let's get to work.

1216
01:08:40,454 --> 01:08:41,589
We got a lot
to get through here.

1217
01:08:41,722 --> 01:08:43,491
So, what exactly
are we looking for?

1218
01:08:43,624 --> 01:08:45,227
We're looking for the guy

1219
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:46,794
who ordered the hit on Cap.

1220
01:08:46,929 --> 01:08:48,663
Armando can I.D. him.

1221
01:08:54,202 --> 01:08:55,670
This fucking bastard

1222
01:08:55,803 --> 01:08:57,306
has been my white whale.

1223
01:08:57,438 --> 01:08:59,573
For the last nine years,
I've been trying

1224
01:08:59,707 --> 01:09:01,442
to harpoon the son of a bitch.

1225
01:09:01,575 --> 01:09:03,744
But now it's up to you.

1226
01:09:22,397 --> 01:09:24,266
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1227
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:26,101
Do I walk into your house and
show you how to make cocaine?

1228
01:09:26,234 --> 01:09:28,303
Blow it up.

1229
01:09:35,377 --> 01:09:36,610
It's him.

1230
01:09:42,483 --> 01:09:43,986
You sure?

1231
01:09:44,119 --> 01:09:46,154
That's the guy
that ordered the hit.

1232
01:09:46,288 --> 01:09:47,621
Bam. Got a name.

1233
01:09:47,755 --> 01:09:49,358
James McGrath.

1234
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:51,559
Army Ranger School,
counterintelligence.

1235
01:09:51,692 --> 01:09:54,329
Deployed in Mexico until 2005.

1236
01:09:54,463 --> 01:09:57,165
Worked with the DEA,
Defense Attaché's Office.

1237
01:09:57,299 --> 01:09:59,835
Oh, shit.
He was taken hostage by...

1238
01:09:59,968 --> 01:10:02,337
your friends, the cartel.

1239
01:10:02,471 --> 01:10:05,374
Gave up his entire squad
"under duress."

1240
01:10:05,506 --> 01:10:06,741
It's called torture, man.

1241
01:10:06,875 --> 01:10:09,945
He was the only survivor.

1242
01:10:14,249 --> 01:10:16,018
Cap had him the whole time.

1243
01:10:16,151 --> 01:10:17,618
-Yeah.
-He just didn't know it.

1244
01:10:17,752 --> 01:10:19,221
Hey.

1245
01:10:21,189 --> 01:10:22,224
Hello.

1246
01:10:22,357 --> 01:10:24,026
Hey. It's me.

1247
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:25,793
Damn it, Michael.

1248
01:10:25,927 --> 01:10:27,029
Where are you?

1249
01:10:27,162 --> 01:10:28,629
Rita, we're coming in.

1250
01:10:28,763 --> 01:10:30,531
We got proof that
Captain Howard is innocent.

1251
01:10:30,664 --> 01:10:32,367
What proof?

1252
01:10:32,501 --> 01:10:35,536
We got the guy
that had Captain Howard killed.

1253
01:10:35,669 --> 01:10:36,838
Armando I.D.'d him.

1254
01:10:36,972 --> 01:10:38,606
Same dude that attacked us
on the chopper:

1255
01:10:38,739 --> 01:10:40,042
James McGrath.

1256
01:10:40,175 --> 01:10:42,610
Rita, we got ten years'
worth of files.

1257
01:10:42,743 --> 01:10:44,413
Cap was investigating
these dudes.

1258
01:10:44,545 --> 01:10:46,181
We got 'em all.
It's a whole network.

1259
01:10:46,314 --> 01:10:48,517
We'll surrender to you
tomorrow.

1260
01:10:48,649 --> 01:10:50,385
Hey, look, we got to go.

1261
01:10:50,519 --> 01:10:52,720
Michael, what...

1262
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:56,557
You okay?

1263
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:59,194
Uh...
they're coming in.

1264
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,594
What?

1265
01:11:00,728 --> 01:11:04,399
Michael says they have proof
that exonerates Howard,

1266
01:11:04,533 --> 01:11:06,401
explains everything.

1267
01:11:07,601 --> 01:11:09,905
Do you still love him?

1268
01:11:11,006 --> 01:11:12,374
What?

1269
01:11:12,507 --> 01:11:14,042
No.

1270
01:11:14,176 --> 01:11:16,777
But I believe him.

1271
01:11:16,912 --> 01:11:18,914
Just be careful, babe.

1272
01:11:20,681 --> 01:11:23,051
-Still going to dinner?
-Yeah.

1273
01:11:26,687 --> 01:11:28,390
They have the files.

1274
01:11:28,523 --> 01:11:31,359
We need to make this look like
cartel business-- Spanish only.

1275
01:11:50,879 --> 01:11:52,481
Shit, shit, shit!

1276
01:11:52,613 --> 01:11:53,915
We need some sleep.

1277
01:11:54,049 --> 01:11:56,151
Hey, guys, we got a problem.

1278
01:11:57,285 --> 01:11:58,820
Miami Central, Miami Central.

1279
01:11:58,954 --> 01:12:00,621
29 in progress
at 3878 Sunshine Avenue.

1280
01:12:00,754 --> 01:12:02,023
Oh, shit. That's my house.

1281
01:12:02,157 --> 01:12:03,158
Shit.

1282
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:04,826
Please advise, MOS residence.

1283
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,161
Respond forthwith.

1284
01:12:06,294 --> 01:12:08,363
Fuck. Fuck.

1285
01:12:10,432 --> 01:12:12,234
Come on, Christine.

1286
01:12:20,542 --> 01:12:23,111
Oh, shit.
Get a unit over to my house.

1287
01:12:23,245 --> 01:12:25,480
-Come on, Reggie. Pick up!
-Miami Central, we have

1288
01:12:25,614 --> 01:12:27,115
-another 29 in progress.
-Pick up. Pick up.

1289
01:12:27,249 --> 01:12:28,450
Please send units

1290
01:12:28,583 --> 01:12:30,152
to Detective Lowrey's
home address.

1291
01:12:31,719 --> 01:12:33,421
Enemy's down!

1292
01:12:33,555 --> 01:12:34,489
Reggie.

1293
01:12:34,623 --> 01:12:36,258
You got incoming.

1294
01:12:36,391 --> 01:12:37,791
Get the family
to somewhere safe.

1295
01:12:37,926 --> 01:12:39,760
-What?
-Now!

1296
01:12:39,895 --> 01:12:41,963
Yes, sir.

1297
01:12:44,166 --> 01:12:46,067
-Come on!
-Hey, what's happening?
Is anybody...

1298
01:12:46,201 --> 01:12:47,636
There's people
coming in the house.
-Okay.

1299
01:12:47,768 --> 01:12:49,571
-I got to keep y'all safe.
Come here.

1300
01:12:53,642 --> 01:12:55,010
-Please be careful.
-Okay, Reggie, what's happening?

1301
01:12:55,143 --> 01:12:56,545
-Trust me. I love you.
-Okay, honey.

1302
01:12:56,677 --> 01:12:58,647
Fuck. Fuck.

1303
01:13:11,126 --> 01:13:12,994
Behi... Behind you, Reg!

1304
01:13:14,429 --> 01:13:15,630
-Oh! Sh...
-Oh, damn!

1305
01:13:24,606 --> 01:13:25,807
Who the fuck is this guy?

1306
01:13:25,941 --> 01:13:27,375
That's my boy! That's my boy.

1307
01:13:29,978 --> 01:13:31,012
Ooh.

1308
01:13:33,882 --> 01:13:36,518
Damn.

1309
01:13:36,651 --> 01:13:38,553
Come on, come on, come on.

1310
01:13:51,866 --> 01:13:52,934
Ooh.

1311
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,575
No, no, no.

1312
01:14:02,177 --> 01:14:03,712
-Whoa!
-Oh, shit.

1313
01:14:08,049 --> 01:14:09,584
Come on, come on.

1314
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:17,592
-Whoo!
-Holy shit.

1315
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:23,231
Oh!

1316
01:14:23,365 --> 01:14:25,634
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
motherfuckers!

1317
01:14:25,766 --> 01:14:27,435
Me snacks is your snacks,
Reggie!

1318
01:14:27,569 --> 01:14:29,971
All right, come on.

1319
01:14:32,574 --> 01:14:34,476
Mike, did you see that shit?

1320
01:14:34,609 --> 01:14:36,777
Pick up the phone.

1321
01:14:36,911 --> 01:14:39,447
Whoa, Mike. Mike! Mike!

1322
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,289
One second.

1323
01:14:51,593 --> 01:14:53,461
-Callie.
-I saw it on TV.

1324
01:14:53,595 --> 01:14:55,096
My mom is after Uncle Mike.

1325
01:14:55,230 --> 01:14:57,966
There is no way that he did
everything that they're saying.

1326
01:14:58,099 --> 01:14:59,768
Sweetheart.

1327
01:15:00,969 --> 01:15:02,704
Everything is going to be okay.

1328
01:15:02,837 --> 01:15:04,973
-Okay.
-Okay?

1329
01:15:05,106 --> 01:15:06,708
Okay?

1330
01:15:17,085 --> 01:15:18,153
Hello?

1331
01:15:18,286 --> 01:15:19,587
It's me. Get out of the house.

1332
01:15:19,721 --> 01:15:21,323
I've got Callie with me.

1333
01:15:21,456 --> 01:15:23,258
Take her and go. Get out now!

1334
01:15:25,727 --> 01:15:27,662
Callie, get behind me.

1335
01:15:28,997 --> 01:15:30,532
Mike.

1336
01:15:35,637 --> 01:15:36,938
Christine!

1337
01:15:46,648 --> 01:15:48,049
Mr. Lowrey.

1338
01:15:49,317 --> 01:15:50,820
Who am I speaking to?

1339
01:15:50,952 --> 01:15:53,655
I think you know
who you're speaking to.

1340
01:15:53,788 --> 01:15:56,191
I need your boy.

1341
01:15:57,359 --> 01:15:58,593
And whatever evidence
your beloved captain

1342
01:15:58,727 --> 01:16:00,261
had squirreled away.

1343
01:16:00,395 --> 01:16:03,898
And for that,
you can have your wife.

1344
01:16:04,032 --> 01:16:06,434
I'll call you back
with instructions.

1345
01:16:07,469 --> 01:16:09,771
Ah, shit.

1346
01:16:11,473 --> 01:16:12,674
Goddamn it.

1347
01:16:12,808 --> 01:16:14,844
I'll go.

1348
01:16:20,315 --> 01:16:22,183
Let my life be worth something.

1349
01:16:24,619 --> 01:16:26,221
Never.

1350
01:16:27,956 --> 01:16:29,825
Never.

1351
01:16:36,698 --> 01:16:38,433
Mike.

1352
01:16:39,567 --> 01:16:41,236
He knew.

1353
01:16:41,369 --> 01:16:43,839
What do you mean?

1354
01:16:43,972 --> 01:16:45,740
He knew we were coming in.

1355
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:48,443
He knew we had
Captain Howard's files.

1356
01:16:48,576 --> 01:16:51,045
He knew we had I.D.'d him.

1357
01:16:51,179 --> 01:16:52,280
How?

1358
01:16:52,414 --> 01:16:55,283
Only person you spoke to
was Rita.

1359
01:16:56,284 --> 01:16:57,752
It's not Rita.

1360
01:17:00,355 --> 01:17:02,924
Damn, she got bad taste in men.

1361
01:17:03,358 --> 01:17:04,926
...Justice
has been

1362
01:17:05,059 --> 01:17:06,361
investigating the corruption of

1363
01:17:06,494 --> 01:17:08,062
the Miami Police Department
with reports suggesting

1364
01:17:08,196 --> 01:17:09,664
the late
Captain Conrad Howard...

1365
01:17:09,798 --> 01:17:11,266
-Hello?
-...directed these elements

1366
01:17:11,399 --> 01:17:13,268
in coordination
with the cartels.

1367
01:17:13,401 --> 01:17:16,137
Allegations against Howard,
which look to include

1368
01:17:16,271 --> 01:17:17,840
Lowrey and Burnett
in the operation,

1369
01:17:17,972 --> 01:17:19,809
range from helping cartels
move product

1370
01:17:19,941 --> 01:17:21,409
into the state of Florida

1371
01:17:21,543 --> 01:17:22,677
as well as giving up
key witnesses,

1372
01:17:22,812 --> 01:17:24,112
destruction of evidence

1373
01:17:24,245 --> 01:17:26,080
and even the murder
of fellow officer...

1374
01:17:26,214 --> 01:17:28,383
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

1375
01:17:29,684 --> 01:17:30,920
There's been a breakthrough
in the case.

1376
01:17:31,052 --> 01:17:33,254
I need to get down
to the station.

1377
01:17:34,622 --> 01:17:36,458
I'm gonna head down there.

1378
01:17:39,461 --> 01:17:40,962
I'm coming with you.

1379
01:17:54,409 --> 01:17:55,977
Who are you texting?

1380
01:17:56,110 --> 01:17:59,280
Ah, just, um, just...

1381
01:17:59,414 --> 01:18:03,685
just got to get in touch
with the office, JTF.

1382
01:18:03,819 --> 01:18:05,487
Got to let everybody know.

1383
01:18:13,328 --> 01:18:14,996
Hey. Honey. Come on.

1384
01:18:15,129 --> 01:18:17,298
Honey,
what are you doing? Stop that.

1385
01:18:17,432 --> 01:18:19,067
What are you doing? Stop it.

1386
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,870
-Let go of me.
-Come on. What are you doing?

1387
01:18:21,002 --> 01:18:22,637
Give it back to me.
Give it back!

1388
01:18:54,702 --> 01:18:56,204
Fuck.

1389
01:18:56,337 --> 01:18:58,106
Hey, hey, hey, come on.

1390
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:00,575
Come on. Come on.

1391
01:19:00,708 --> 01:19:01,776
You okay?

1392
01:19:01,911 --> 01:19:03,511
Look at the phone.

1393
01:19:14,155 --> 01:19:15,958
You know you done
fucked up, right?

1394
01:19:21,062 --> 01:19:22,530
You all right?

1395
01:19:26,869 --> 01:19:28,503
I'm sorry.

1396
01:19:29,737 --> 01:19:32,073
Ain't got nothing
to be sorry for.

1397
01:19:54,662 --> 01:19:56,230
We'll find her, boss.

1398
01:19:59,567 --> 01:20:01,837
I don't trust anybody

1399
01:20:01,971 --> 01:20:05,740
that's not standing right here
right now.

1400
01:20:05,874 --> 01:20:08,176
Every extra person
that we involve

1401
01:20:08,309 --> 01:20:11,646
increases the likelihood
that they know we're coming,

1402
01:20:11,779 --> 01:20:13,681
which increases the likelihood

1403
01:20:13,816 --> 01:20:17,619
that Christine and Callie
don't make it out of there.

1404
01:20:17,752 --> 01:20:20,121
That means no SWAT,

1405
01:20:20,254 --> 01:20:24,292
no Marshals, no backup.

1406
01:20:24,425 --> 01:20:26,028
It's just us.

1407
01:20:31,366 --> 01:20:33,234
I never meant for it
to go this way.

1408
01:20:33,368 --> 01:20:35,670
How did you mean it to go?

1409
01:20:35,803 --> 01:20:40,174
After 9/11, nobody cared about
drugs coming into this country.

1410
01:20:40,308 --> 01:20:41,609
So, to secure the borders,

1411
01:20:41,743 --> 01:20:43,411
we started to work
with the cartels.

1412
01:20:43,544 --> 01:20:45,014
And they kept us informed about

1413
01:20:45,146 --> 01:20:46,982
any terrorist activity
coming our way.

1414
01:20:47,116 --> 01:20:48,817
And it worked.

1415
01:20:48,951 --> 01:20:50,853
We haven't had an attack since.

1416
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,321
We were protecting
this country.

1417
01:20:53,454 --> 01:20:55,323
You were killing cops
and getting rich

1418
01:20:55,456 --> 01:20:57,592
putting drugs
into this country.

1419
01:20:57,725 --> 01:20:58,693
Rita.

1420
01:20:58,827 --> 01:20:59,962
That's why you killed Howard.

1421
01:21:00,095 --> 01:21:01,096
He was onto you.

1422
01:21:01,229 --> 01:21:02,330
You wanted to cover
your tracks.

1423
01:21:02,463 --> 01:21:04,632
No. That was McGrath.

1424
01:21:04,766 --> 01:21:06,801
He's out of control.

1425
01:21:06,935 --> 01:21:09,337
Rita, just take a second.

1426
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:12,540
I never meant for any of this
to go this way.

1427
01:21:22,617 --> 01:21:25,888
I guess I just need to know
if it was ever real.

1428
01:21:26,889 --> 01:21:28,690
It was always real.

1429
01:21:28,824 --> 01:21:30,191
I panicked.

1430
01:21:30,324 --> 01:21:31,693
I lost control.

1431
01:21:31,827 --> 01:21:34,029
Did you love me?

1432
01:21:34,163 --> 01:21:35,730
Yes.

1433
01:21:35,864 --> 01:21:37,900
I swear.

1434
01:21:38,033 --> 01:21:39,233
Well, that means...

1435
01:21:39,367 --> 01:21:40,836
We're good. We got it.

1436
01:21:40,969 --> 01:21:43,005
99% voice match.

1437
01:21:44,305 --> 01:21:48,710
...absolutely nothing to me,
you piece of shit.

1438
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:57,485
Hey. It's me.

1439
01:21:57,618 --> 01:21:59,353
What the hell's going on?

1440
01:21:59,487 --> 01:22:01,355
You screwed up
is what's going on.

1441
01:22:01,489 --> 01:22:03,324
We've been compromised.

1442
01:22:03,458 --> 01:22:05,259
I'll explain when I get there.

1443
01:22:05,393 --> 01:22:06,862
We're moving the hostages.

1444
01:22:06,995 --> 01:22:08,629
Cuba, long-term hold...

1445
01:22:08,763 --> 01:22:10,465
...to keep Lowrey, Burnett

1446
01:22:10,598 --> 01:22:13,434
and Aretas quiet
while we sort this out.

1447
01:22:13,568 --> 01:22:15,037
I'm bringing a seaplane.

1448
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:16,939
I'll be there at first light.

1449
01:22:21,576 --> 01:22:23,478
All right, pack this place up.

1450
01:22:23,611 --> 01:22:26,547
All equipment and personnel,
prepare to move.

1451
01:22:26,681 --> 01:22:28,984
We're moving the hostages
out of the country.

1452
01:22:43,397 --> 01:22:45,067
What happened to your hand?

1453
01:22:53,508 --> 01:22:56,145
They call that
a Colombian manicure.

1454
01:23:02,184 --> 01:23:04,153
What's so great about it

1455
01:23:04,285 --> 01:23:07,655
is it's the maximum amount
of pain, but you don't die.

1456
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:16,364
So now you've decided to be
the one holding the pliers.

1457
01:23:17,465 --> 01:23:19,935
Everybody breaks.

1458
01:23:20,068 --> 01:23:21,803
Everyone.

1459
01:23:21,937 --> 01:23:26,507
Your husband is gonna
kneel down in front of me

1460
01:23:26,641 --> 01:23:29,812
and beg for your lives.

1461
01:23:29,945 --> 01:23:32,480
And then you're gonna
watch me kill him.

1462
01:23:35,349 --> 01:23:37,351
You don't know my husband.

1463
01:23:37,485 --> 01:23:40,788
Well, not officially, but...

1464
01:23:40,923 --> 01:23:43,091
I look forward
to seeing him again.

1465
01:24:02,277 --> 01:24:03,979
Mm-mm.

1466
01:24:04,112 --> 01:24:06,014
Come on, Mike.

1467
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:19,261
Yeah.

1468
01:24:26,367 --> 01:24:28,502
That-that's enough, dawg.
That's enough.

1469
01:24:28,636 --> 01:24:31,340
Okay, well, we'll circle back
on that one.

1470
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:44,752
All right, the plane is ready.
We roll in 20.

1471
01:24:44,887 --> 01:24:46,255
It's an
abandoned amusement park.

1472
01:24:46,387 --> 01:24:47,555
There should be no civilians.

1473
01:24:47,688 --> 01:24:49,523
Plane is gonna land
from the south

1474
01:24:49,657 --> 01:24:51,026
on the one side.

1475
01:24:51,159 --> 01:24:54,296
Marcus and I will be
on the plane.

1476
01:24:54,428 --> 01:24:58,000
Armando's gonna make his way
in the water-- the two side.

1477
01:24:58,133 --> 01:25:02,337
Kelly, Rita, this road is
one way in, one way out.

1478
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:04,106
You're holding that road.

1479
01:25:06,375 --> 01:25:08,043
Dorn, you're gonna
control the air.

1480
01:25:08,176 --> 01:25:09,443
Drones in the air.

1481
01:25:09,577 --> 01:25:12,114
Jamming is active.
Comms are secure.

1482
01:25:12,247 --> 01:25:14,950
As far as they know, Lockwood
is on his way with the plane

1483
01:25:15,083 --> 01:25:18,253
to move the hostages to Cuba.

1484
01:25:18,387 --> 01:25:20,488
The second they get close
to the plane with the hostages,

1485
01:25:20,621 --> 01:25:21,890
it's quick kills.

1486
01:25:22,024 --> 01:25:23,491
Neutralize all threats.

1487
01:25:23,624 --> 01:25:26,061
These motherfuckers killed
a lot of good cops.

1488
01:25:26,194 --> 01:25:28,230
They have my wife.
They have Callie.

1489
01:25:28,363 --> 01:25:30,165
They attacked our families.

1490
01:25:30,299 --> 01:25:32,301
We're not losing today.

1491
01:25:35,370 --> 01:25:36,604
Hey.

1492
01:25:37,772 --> 01:25:40,242
We get on the ground,
you even flinch,

1493
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:42,411
you'll be dead in .24 seconds.

1494
01:25:42,543 --> 01:25:43,946
I concur.

1495
01:25:45,414 --> 01:25:47,782
I got one lookout
on the platform outside.

1496
01:25:47,916 --> 01:25:50,584
I got one sniper
on the roof of building two.

1497
01:25:50,718 --> 01:25:52,387
Tee those up.

1498
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:56,490
Everybody, keep moving.

1499
01:25:56,624 --> 01:25:58,592
-What are those?
-Gators.

1500
01:25:58,726 --> 01:26:01,296
I thought it was
an abandoned gator park.

1501
01:26:01,430 --> 01:26:02,763
Abandoned by humans.

1502
01:26:03,798 --> 01:26:05,100
It's actually
an old amusement park.

1503
01:26:05,233 --> 01:26:06,335
It sat on ten acres.

1504
01:26:06,467 --> 01:26:08,337
Abandoned in 2017
after Hurricane Irma.

1505
01:26:08,469 --> 01:26:10,305
Their main attraction was

1506
01:26:10,439 --> 01:26:13,342
an albino alligator named Duke,

1507
01:26:13,474 --> 01:26:16,878
who was 16 feet long,
900 pounds.

1508
01:26:17,012 --> 01:26:19,381
"And legend has it
he's still there"?

1509
01:26:19,513 --> 01:26:21,216
Fuck that.

1510
01:26:36,131 --> 01:26:37,565
Armando's at his QTH.

1511
01:27:02,858 --> 01:27:04,493
Hostages are coming out now.

1512
01:27:04,625 --> 01:27:06,128
McGrath plus three.

1513
01:27:06,261 --> 01:27:08,063
Everybody, stay calm.

1514
01:27:08,196 --> 01:27:09,965
All right.

1515
01:27:18,874 --> 01:27:20,909
Mike.

1516
01:27:22,543 --> 01:27:24,246
Mike, do you have the shot?

1517
01:27:24,379 --> 01:27:25,947
Negative. I do not have a shot.

1518
01:27:26,081 --> 01:27:28,884
I do not have a shot.

1519
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:33,587
-Mike, he's right there.
-I don't have it.

1520
01:27:33,721 --> 01:27:35,589
I don't have it.

1521
01:27:40,929 --> 01:27:43,564
They stopped. Why'd they stop?

1522
01:27:57,512 --> 01:27:58,746
Shit.

1523
01:28:01,817 --> 01:28:03,251
Let's go.

1524
01:28:13,228 --> 01:28:14,762
Armando,
they're closing in on you.

1525
01:28:14,896 --> 01:28:16,764
-Do they see him?
-I don't know.

1526
01:28:16,898 --> 01:28:19,301
Mike, now. Your chance is now.

1527
01:28:19,434 --> 01:28:21,602
They can see him.
They know we're here.

1528
01:28:24,473 --> 01:28:26,308
I don't have it.
Negative. Negative. Negative.

1529
01:28:26,441 --> 01:28:28,343
You got to take
the fucking shot.

1530
01:28:47,929 --> 01:28:49,663
Armando's burnt.

1531
01:28:50,798 --> 01:28:51,632
Shit.

1532
01:28:51,765 --> 01:28:53,301
Full green! Engage!

1533
01:28:53,435 --> 01:28:55,669
Kelly, get us there.
Go, go, go!

1534
01:29:18,759 --> 01:29:20,829
Contact, west dock side.

1535
01:29:21,830 --> 01:29:23,664
Sh...

1536
01:29:28,937 --> 01:29:31,072
-Dorn, take out that sniper!
-Shit.

1537
01:29:31,206 --> 01:29:32,974
Sending the drone.

1538
01:29:41,715 --> 01:29:43,218
Got him.

1539
01:30:05,773 --> 01:30:07,642
Not now, Mike!

1540
01:30:07,775 --> 01:30:09,411
Not now!

1541
01:30:30,565 --> 01:30:32,467
It's okay.

1542
01:30:32,601 --> 01:30:34,269
Not your fault.

1543
01:30:41,775 --> 01:30:44,412
Cut that
bitch-ass shit out, Mike!

1544
01:30:44,546 --> 01:30:47,249
I need Nasty Mike. Nasty Mike!

1545
01:30:47,382 --> 01:30:50,151
Bad shit happens, but
that doesn't mean you're bad.

1546
01:30:50,285 --> 01:30:52,287
Do that donkey shit, a'ight?

1547
01:30:52,420 --> 01:30:54,356
That's what I'm talking about.
That shit right there.

1548
01:30:54,489 --> 01:30:56,258
That's that shit right there.

1549
01:30:56,391 --> 01:30:58,260
Bad boy! Bad boy!

1550
01:30:58,393 --> 01:31:00,228
Bad Boy Mike! All right?

1551
01:31:18,613 --> 01:31:21,283
Mike!

1552
01:31:35,563 --> 01:31:37,499
Dorn, take out
the vehicles on the four side.

1553
01:31:37,632 --> 01:31:38,700
Copy.

1554
01:31:45,473 --> 01:31:47,108
Go! Go! Move!

1555
01:31:47,242 --> 01:31:48,710
Sir! We're taking heavies.

1556
01:31:48,843 --> 01:31:50,345
We lost the trucks
and three guys outside.

1557
01:31:50,478 --> 01:31:51,613
Goddamn it!

1558
01:31:53,014 --> 01:31:54,516
Set firing positions,
both sides.

1559
01:31:54,649 --> 01:31:55,884
-Let 'em in.
-Go.

1560
01:31:56,017 --> 01:31:58,086
Marshal Howard, heat signature

1561
01:31:58,219 --> 01:32:00,455
at the site of the AMMO van
is showing explosions.

1562
01:32:00,588 --> 01:32:02,190
ETA 15 minutes.

1563
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:08,129
Dorn, we need cover, and
we need eyes inside. Go now.

1564
01:32:09,164 --> 01:32:10,699
Here comes the smoke.

1565
01:32:12,567 --> 01:32:14,336
I got your six.

1566
01:32:36,826 --> 01:32:39,194
-Move, move, move!
-Eyes up!

1567
01:32:44,566 --> 01:32:46,201
Oh, shit!

1568
01:32:46,334 --> 01:32:49,270
It's like
redneck Jurassic Park in here.

1569
01:33:04,686 --> 01:33:06,187
Let's get out of here now.

1570
01:33:06,321 --> 01:33:07,355
Kelly, go.

1571
01:33:07,489 --> 01:33:09,591
Dorn, back up Kelly inside.

1572
01:33:09,724 --> 01:33:11,493
I'm going after Lockwood.

1573
01:33:11,626 --> 01:33:12,894
Babe, I'm coming.

1574
01:33:19,401 --> 01:33:21,202
Armando, go for Callie!

1575
01:33:23,671 --> 01:33:24,706
Let go!

1576
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:26,241
Mike!

1577
01:33:27,242 --> 01:33:28,376
Marcus!

1578
01:33:46,728 --> 01:33:48,229
Go!

1579
01:33:52,967 --> 01:33:54,569
I'm out!

1580
01:34:28,736 --> 01:34:31,406
Nice to meet you, Mr. Lowrey.

1581
01:34:32,407 --> 01:34:33,541
Grenade!

1582
01:34:54,128 --> 01:34:55,396
Holy shit!

1583
01:34:55,530 --> 01:34:56,798
Hang on!

1584
01:35:28,696 --> 01:35:30,532
Stop!

1585
01:35:30,665 --> 01:35:32,233
Christine!

1586
01:35:34,102 --> 01:35:35,270
Christine!

1587
01:35:35,403 --> 01:35:37,238
Shit.

1588
01:35:39,707 --> 01:35:41,342
Oh, shit.

1589
01:35:41,476 --> 01:35:42,544
Mike, I got this!

1590
01:35:42,677 --> 01:35:44,612
-No. No, no.
-Here I come, baby!

1591
01:35:44,746 --> 01:35:46,916
-Here I come!
-No, no, no!

1592
01:36:01,362 --> 01:36:02,730
Marcus!

1593
01:36:02,865 --> 01:36:04,365
-What?
-Behind you.

1594
01:36:06,467 --> 01:36:08,369
Oh, shit.

1595
01:36:17,178 --> 01:36:19,447
I got this, Mike.

1596
01:36:19,581 --> 01:36:21,616
It's just Dukey, baby.

1597
01:36:24,352 --> 01:36:26,187
Marcus, my gun.
I dropped my gun in the water.

1598
01:36:26,321 --> 01:36:28,222
-It's by your foot.
-I don't need no gun, Mike.

1599
01:36:31,326 --> 01:36:33,561
Begone, gator.

1600
01:36:33,695 --> 01:36:36,230
This is not your place, Duke.

1601
01:36:36,364 --> 01:36:38,466
I rebuke you.

1602
01:36:42,437 --> 01:36:44,073
See, Mike?

1603
01:36:44,205 --> 01:36:46,240
That's how you command
the universe.

1604
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:01,255
-Oh, shit!
-The gun. Where's the gun?

1605
01:37:06,461 --> 01:37:09,064
Go, go, go, go.

1606
01:37:09,197 --> 01:37:10,833
That motherfucker racist, Mike.

1607
01:37:10,966 --> 01:37:13,068
-Go. Go.
-That motherfucker racist.

1608
01:37:19,273 --> 01:37:20,742
Mike sent me.

1609
01:37:20,876 --> 01:37:21,944
I need you to trust me.

1610
01:37:47,268 --> 01:37:49,437
Run. Run!

1611
01:38:33,681 --> 01:38:35,750
Come on. Come on. Get up.

1612
01:38:49,564 --> 01:38:51,599
No!

1613
01:38:55,871 --> 01:38:57,772
Go. I'll slow you down.

1614
01:39:01,242 --> 01:39:02,811
Eyes on location.

1615
01:39:24,565 --> 01:39:26,434
Oh, shit.

1616
01:39:28,237 --> 01:39:29,604
You alive?

1617
01:39:37,045 --> 01:39:39,781
Shit. Okay. Hey.

1618
01:39:42,885 --> 01:39:44,352
Rita, stop this.

1619
01:39:44,485 --> 01:39:45,854
You don't want to shoot me.

1620
01:39:45,988 --> 01:39:46,955
You're right.

1621
01:40:07,642 --> 01:40:09,777
-Ow! Ow.
-Come here.

1622
01:40:09,912 --> 01:40:11,312
-Okay, okay. It's okay.
-Ow.

1623
01:40:12,346 --> 01:40:14,749
-I fucking hate politicians.
-Shh.

1624
01:40:21,322 --> 01:40:22,958
-Let's move!
-Go, go!

1625
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:53,588
Okay. Okay, here.

1626
01:40:53,721 --> 01:40:54,823
-Put me down.
-Okay.

1627
01:40:54,957 --> 01:40:56,058
-It's okay.
-You okay?

1628
01:40:56,191 --> 01:40:57,758
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Okay.

1629
01:40:58,793 --> 01:41:00,361
Hey.

1630
01:41:03,298 --> 01:41:04,665
Thank you.

1631
01:41:25,486 --> 01:41:28,023
I've been here before.

1632
01:41:30,524 --> 01:41:32,060
Oh, shit.

1633
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:56,885
How did you let him catch you?

1634
01:41:57,019 --> 01:41:58,987
He's sneaky as hell, Mike.

1635
01:41:59,121 --> 01:42:00,956
Your wife and I
were having a debate.

1636
01:42:01,089 --> 01:42:03,959
She seems to have
an inflated impression of you.

1637
01:42:04,092 --> 01:42:06,594
-Mike.
-Hey, bae.

1638
01:42:06,727 --> 01:42:08,964
Nevertheless, this is
the end of the road.

1639
01:42:09,097 --> 01:42:11,233
One of them is about to die.

1640
01:42:11,366 --> 01:42:14,002
You choose.

1641
01:42:17,605 --> 01:42:20,275
What you don't know,
Mr. McGrath,

1642
01:42:20,409 --> 01:42:22,476
is one of 'em can't die.

1643
01:42:24,346 --> 01:42:26,048
Who you talking 'bout?

1644
01:42:26,181 --> 01:42:28,951
A wise man told me I was gonna
have to make a hard choice.

1645
01:42:29,084 --> 01:42:31,286
You need to check
with that motherfucker

1646
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:33,454
before you out here
choosing shit.

1647
01:42:33,587 --> 01:42:35,656
You have
five seconds, Mr. Lowrey.

1648
01:42:35,790 --> 01:42:37,326
We gonna need
some more time, sir.

1649
01:42:37,458 --> 01:42:39,760
Four, three...

1650
01:42:39,895 --> 01:42:42,064
Mike, don't you do
no dumb shit.

1651
01:42:42,197 --> 01:42:43,464
...two...

1652
01:43:00,082 --> 01:43:02,483
-Mike. Mike.
-Hey. Hey. I'm here.

1653
01:43:04,353 --> 01:43:06,054
Motherfucker done shot me.

1654
01:43:06,188 --> 01:43:07,655
-Oh, damn.
-Here.

1655
01:43:07,788 --> 01:43:09,157
-No, Mike.
-Okay. Just let me check it.

1656
01:43:09,291 --> 01:43:10,826
-Let me see.
-Your donkey ass shot me again.

1657
01:43:10,959 --> 01:43:12,461
-Let me look at it. Just...
-Don't touch me

1658
01:43:12,593 --> 01:43:13,694
with your donkey hooves, Mike.

1659
01:43:13,829 --> 01:43:15,696
-Just... Look, what you...
-Damn, man.

1660
01:43:15,831 --> 01:43:18,033
Listen, I had to fucking
take the shot.

1661
01:43:18,166 --> 01:43:19,667
-No, Mike. No.
-Marcus.

1662
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,136
Let me take a look, Marcus.

1663
01:43:21,269 --> 01:43:22,670
You see that shit, Christine?

1664
01:43:22,803 --> 01:43:24,106
Look, I shot you in your vest.

1665
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:26,141
-Stop bitching.
-It don't matter, okay?

1666
01:43:26,274 --> 01:43:28,810
You see what you done devoted
your life to, Christine?

1667
01:43:28,944 --> 01:43:30,445
I've got eyes on Aretas.

1668
01:43:30,578 --> 01:43:32,447
-Moving in.
-Shit. That's Judy.

1669
01:43:32,580 --> 01:43:34,883
Armando, do you copy?

1670
01:43:35,017 --> 01:43:37,152
Armando, do you copy?

1671
01:43:38,954 --> 01:43:39,821
Shit.

1672
01:43:39,955 --> 01:43:41,023
Mom!

1673
01:43:41,156 --> 01:43:42,391
Mom, don't.

1674
01:43:42,523 --> 01:43:44,226
Get away from her.

1675
01:43:44,359 --> 01:43:46,395
-Mom.
-Now!

1676
01:43:46,527 --> 01:43:48,230
Mom, listen to me.
You don't understand.

1677
01:43:48,363 --> 01:43:50,132
Callie, I need you
to listen to me.

1678
01:43:50,265 --> 01:43:52,566
I want you to step slowly
to your right

1679
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:53,701
and walk towards me.

1680
01:43:53,835 --> 01:43:55,270
Mom, Mom, I'm fine, okay?

1681
01:43:55,404 --> 01:43:59,374
Callie, I need you
to move out of the way.

1682
01:43:59,508 --> 01:44:01,076
Mom.

1683
01:44:01,209 --> 01:44:02,344
Mom, don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1684
01:44:02,477 --> 01:44:04,612
Mom, he saved me. Stop!

1685
01:44:04,745 --> 01:44:05,881
Judy! Judy!

1686
01:44:06,014 --> 01:44:07,516
-Back off, Mike!
-Judy. Judy.

1687
01:44:07,648 --> 01:44:09,217
Put the gun down!

1688
01:44:10,819 --> 01:44:12,553
He saved my life.

1689
01:44:16,757 --> 01:44:18,894
Please, Mom.

1690
01:44:40,182 --> 01:44:42,417
Are you hit? Are you hit?

1691
01:44:42,551 --> 01:44:44,419
I'm good.

1692
01:44:44,553 --> 01:44:46,221
You good?

1693
01:44:50,724 --> 01:44:53,095
You did good. You did good.

1694
01:44:53,228 --> 01:44:55,030
Howard, where are you?

1695
01:44:58,900 --> 01:45:00,768
Howard, do you copy?

1696
01:45:02,803 --> 01:45:05,407
Howard, what's your location?

1697
01:45:09,777 --> 01:45:11,246
Go.

1698
01:45:12,814 --> 01:45:14,349
Before I change my mind.

1699
01:45:16,218 --> 01:45:18,587
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1700
01:45:24,993 --> 01:45:27,562
Here. You good? You good?

1701
01:45:27,695 --> 01:45:29,965
Hey. Take this.

1702
01:45:30,098 --> 01:45:31,765
Head south.

1703
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:33,435
-Don't look back.
-Hey.

1704
01:45:33,568 --> 01:45:34,903
I got it.

1705
01:45:35,036 --> 01:45:36,737
Be good.

1706
01:45:36,872 --> 01:45:38,573
It's not up to you, Detective.

1707
01:46:22,683 --> 01:46:24,419
Come on, come on.
We got injured cops here.

1708
01:46:24,553 --> 01:46:26,821
And you, I need you
to bring the writ to me now.

1709
01:46:26,955 --> 01:46:28,689
I know, I know, I know.

1710
01:46:28,823 --> 01:46:30,525
-How is he?
-You know, pulling through.

1711
01:46:30,659 --> 01:46:31,826
Ow.

1712
01:46:37,765 --> 01:46:39,534
Don't kiss him, Christine.

1713
01:46:39,668 --> 01:46:41,636
Mike, in our next life,

1714
01:46:41,769 --> 01:46:44,072
you coming back
as a pair of my shoes.

1715
01:46:44,206 --> 01:46:45,739
And I ain't gonna wear
no socks,

1716
01:46:45,874 --> 01:46:48,143
and I'm-a step
in all kind of shit.

1717
01:46:48,276 --> 01:46:49,978
Miami DA and mayoral candidate

1718
01:46:50,111 --> 01:46:52,514
Adam Lockwood and former
Army Ranger James McGrath

1719
01:46:52,647 --> 01:46:54,583
were killed this morning in a
firefight in the Florida Keys.

1720
01:46:54,715 --> 01:46:56,351
It is believed
that Lockwood and McGrath were

1721
01:46:56,484 --> 01:46:58,520
the key links between Miami
law enforcement and cartels...

1722
01:46:58,653 --> 01:46:59,921
The late Captain Howard

1723
01:47:00,055 --> 01:47:01,389
has been fully exonerated.

1724
01:47:01,523 --> 01:47:03,425
Coconspirators are
currently being rounded up

1725
01:47:03,558 --> 01:47:05,694
by the FBI and the Miami PD.

1726
01:47:05,827 --> 01:47:07,362
The search for convicted killer

1727
01:47:07,495 --> 01:47:09,464
Armando Aretas continues.

1728
01:47:09,598 --> 01:47:11,900
The fugitive remains at large.

1729
01:47:20,909 --> 01:47:22,077
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Hey.

1730
01:47:22,210 --> 01:47:23,178
-My people.
-Where's Theresa?

1731
01:47:23,311 --> 01:47:25,413
She's with Little Marcus
by the swings.

1732
01:47:25,547 --> 01:47:26,815
Hey. I'm about
to hook y'all up.

1733
01:47:26,948 --> 01:47:28,383
-I'm about to hook you up.
-Please. We're starving.

1734
01:47:28,516 --> 01:47:29,750
Watch this.

1735
01:47:30,784 --> 01:47:32,254
Partner.

1736
01:47:33,355 --> 01:47:35,357
What's all this?

1737
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:37,758
What...
Why you got on an apron?

1738
01:47:37,892 --> 01:47:39,760
Work on my grill skills.

1739
01:47:39,894 --> 01:47:42,097
No, Mike,
you got to earn the grill.

1740
01:47:42,230 --> 01:47:45,200
This takes seasonings
and temperatures.

1741
01:47:45,333 --> 01:47:47,068
You can't just be cooking
on my grill.

1742
01:47:47,202 --> 01:47:49,971
Your grill?
Joker, this is a public park.

1743
01:47:50,105 --> 01:47:52,240
You don't own
every grill you see.

1744
01:47:52,374 --> 01:47:53,774
You know what, Mike?

1745
01:47:53,908 --> 01:47:56,811
Why don't you go make some
potato salad and set the table.

1746
01:47:56,945 --> 01:47:58,480
Oh, you talking dirty.

1747
01:47:58,613 --> 01:48:00,882
Now, look, I-I don't know
what you got going on

1748
01:48:01,016 --> 01:48:03,018
with your barbecue dictatorship
in your mind,

1749
01:48:03,151 --> 01:48:04,452
but I ain't the one.

1750
01:48:04,586 --> 01:48:06,521
I'm cooking on this grill
whether you like it or not.

1751
01:48:06,655 --> 01:48:07,989
-Hey, Mike...
-Excuse me, sirs.

1752
01:48:08,123 --> 01:48:10,091
You're not...

1753
01:48:10,225 --> 01:48:12,160
Why you...
What you doing, Reggie?

1754
01:48:12,294 --> 01:48:14,429
Request permission
to cook my chicken.

1755
01:48:18,433 --> 01:48:20,635
Permission denied, Reggie.
Go ahead somewhere, man.

1756
01:48:20,769 --> 01:48:22,937
Take your smock off
and go play with the kids.

1757
01:48:23,071 --> 01:48:25,140
Listen, this is the...
this is the man area

1758
01:48:25,273 --> 01:48:26,474
of the-the barbecue.

1759
01:48:26,608 --> 01:48:28,109
-Yeah.
-Look, you know what?

1760
01:48:28,243 --> 01:48:29,678
All due respect, we appreciate

1761
01:48:29,811 --> 01:48:31,780
that you did save people
that we love.

1762
01:48:31,913 --> 01:48:33,515
-We appreciate that, right?
-Yeah, we appreciate that.

1763
01:48:33,648 --> 01:48:35,784
-We appreciate that
from here, Reggie. -Yeah.

1764
01:48:35,917 --> 01:48:38,620
-Now, back the fuck up.
-Yeah.

1765
01:48:38,753 --> 01:48:40,689
All right, look, I'm-I'm
willing to compromise with you.

1766
01:48:40,822 --> 01:48:42,691
You can work that half
of the grill-- it's small--

1767
01:48:42,824 --> 01:48:44,025
and I'll work this half, but...

1768
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:46,194
Is he still standing there?

1769
01:48:47,996 --> 01:48:49,297
Yes, he is.

1770
01:48:49,431 --> 01:48:50,832
Huh. That's weird.

1771
01:48:50,965 --> 01:48:52,200
Yeah.

1772
01:48:52,334 --> 01:48:55,003
He think he hard now.

1773
01:48:55,136 --> 01:48:57,305
You need to let
that motherfucker know

1774
01:48:57,439 --> 01:49:00,108
he ain't cooking no chicken
out here today.

1775
01:49:00,241 --> 01:49:04,679
Mike, he killed 15 people
at the house.

1776
01:49:04,814 --> 01:49:06,581
So you not gonna handle
this shit?

1777
01:49:06,715 --> 01:49:09,851
Yeah, I'm gonna let that
motherfucker cook the chicken.

1778
01:49:13,823 --> 01:49:15,423
Yeah, there's something weird
in his eyes.

1779
01:49:15,557 --> 01:49:17,392
Uh, so I'm-a make
the potato salad.

1780
01:49:17,525 --> 01:49:19,194
-I'm-a set the table.
-Yeah.

1781
01:49:19,327 --> 01:49:20,762
Permission granted, Reggie.
There you go.

1782
01:55:27,762 --> 01:55:28,964
Come on.

1783
01:55:29,098 --> 01:55:30,199
Bring your ass on.

1784
01:55:30,364 --> 01:55:32,233
It's too hot out here
for this shit.

1785
01:55:32,366 --> 01:55:33,902
Wish I had a horse.

1786
01:55:34,036 --> 01:55:36,038
At least I could ride
that motherfucker.

1787
01:55:36,171 --> 01:55:38,306
All this free air out here,

1788
01:55:38,439 --> 01:55:41,375
and I still smell
your stinking ass.

1789
01:55:43,277 --> 01:55:44,612
I curse you, donkey.

1790
01:55:44,746 --> 01:55:47,381
I curse you for all lifetimes.

1791
01:55:47,515 --> 01:55:48,884
Oh!

1792
01:55:49,017 --> 01:55:50,185
You mother--

1793
01:55:50,318 --> 01:55:52,121
Fuck you, Marcus.
