1
00:01:05,192 --> 00:01:06,234
Bast...

2
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,067
time is running out.

3
00:01:10,234 --> 00:01:12,526
Please allow me to heal my brother of this illness...

4
00:01:13,317 --> 00:01:15,858
and I will never question your existence again.

5
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:18,442
His heart rate is dropping fast. Where are we?

6
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:19,817
We are finishing a sequence now.

7
00:01:19,983 --> 00:01:21,567
GRIOT, give me the controls.

8
00:01:21,693 --> 00:01:22,942
As you wish, Princess.

9
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:30,234
What is the confidence rate?

10
00:01:30,776 --> 00:01:31,942
25%.

11
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:34,526
We'll have to try another way.

12
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:38,109
King T'Challa's heart rate has fallen to 31 beats per minute.

13
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:40,734
Princess, you should go be by his side.

14
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,442
I have to think. Everyone, get out.

15
00:01:44,776 --> 00:01:45,859
Get out!

16
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:53,067
What is the confidence rate?

17
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,609
29.1%.

18
00:01:54,818 --> 00:01:55,818
Print it!

19
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:04,442
Princess, I am aware of the urgency, but I must warn you...

20
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:06,401
this synthetic Heart-Shaped Herb...

21
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:08,776
has a minimal chance of producing the desired effects.

22
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:12,067
I don't care! Has to work.

23
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,401
GRIOT.

24
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:33,567
Yes, Princess?

25
00:02:34,442 --> 00:02:35,859
What's my brother's heart rate?

26
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:45,776
Your brother is with the ancestors.

27
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,234
No.

28
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:05,276
We give thanks for the gift of King T'Challa.

29
00:03:06,317 --> 00:03:11,068
The Black Panther.

30
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,359
Son of King T'Chaka.

31
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:16,901
My son.

32
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:22,484
Descendant of the most revered King Bashenga,

33
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:25,401
the first Black Panther.

34
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:27,651
We release you.

35
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:29,943
Praise the ancestors.

36
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:54,985
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

37
00:03:55,985 --> 00:04:00,026
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

38
00:04:00,985 --> 00:04:04,901
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

39
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:09,609
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

40
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:15,026
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

41
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,235
T'Challa, T'Challa, T'Challa

42
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:22,693
T'Challa

43
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:52,068
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

44
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:37,153
It is an honor for me...

45
00:07:37,236 --> 00:07:39,902
to invite her majesty, Queen Ramonda...

46
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:43,485
daughter of Lumumba, sovereign ruler of the kingdom of Wakanda.

47
00:07:57,194 --> 00:07:59,777
Mr. Chairperson...

48
00:07:59,944 --> 00:08:04,361
I believe I speak for all the member states here...

49
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:08,361
when I say that I am deeply disappointed in Wakanda's...

50
00:08:08,444 --> 00:08:13,320
failure to stand by promises to participate in global efforts...

51
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:17,652
to tackle international challenges, to share resources...

52
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,320
and full cooperation...

53
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:21,694
concerning vibranium.

54
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:28,861
France has information that vibranium can be used to make weapons of mass destruction.

55
00:08:29,278 --> 00:08:32,736
It does not trigger any known metal detector.

56
00:08:33,902 --> 00:08:39,320
It is a threat to global security and the non-proliferation regime.

57
00:08:39,445 --> 00:08:42,777
I now give the floor to Her Majesty, Queen Ramonda.

58
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:52,694
It has always been our policy...

59
00:08:52,861 --> 00:08:57,777
to never trade vibranium under any circumstance.

60
00:08:58,028 --> 00:09:02,819
Not because of the dangerous potential of vibranium...

61
00:09:02,986 --> 00:09:07,486
but because of the dangerous potential of you.

62
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:21,153
I just lost security visuals.

63
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:28,403
Down on your stomachs right now!

64
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:29,986
Face to the floor! Go! Go!

65
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,433
Where are the vibranium tools?

66
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,625
Who has access?

67
00:10:38,616 --> 00:10:43,028
You perform civility here.

68
00:10:43,486 --> 00:10:45,859
But we know what you whisper...

69
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:50,314
in your halls of leadership and in your military facilities.

70
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:58,016
"The King is dead.

71
00:10:59,722 --> 00:11:02,803
"The Black Panther is gone.

72
00:11:04,718 --> 00:11:07,965
"They have lost their protector.

73
00:11:13,793 --> 00:11:17,082
"Now is our time...

74
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:19,663
"to strike."

75
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:48,763
Aneka, where is your spear?

76
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:50,345
Shuri gave me these to try.

77
00:11:53,051 --> 00:11:54,800
You know, I like them better.

78
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:56,465
Our foremothers gave us the spear...

79
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:59,337
because it is precise, elegant...

80
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:02,210
and deadly.

81
00:12:05,165 --> 00:12:07,330
It will not change under my watch.

82
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:10,744
Yes, General.

83
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,200
I told you not to bring them.

84
00:12:16,115 --> 00:12:20,819
Last night there was another attack on one of our outreach facilities.

85
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:25,315
Proof of the involvement of a member state...

86
00:12:25,564 --> 00:12:29,561
is being uploaded to your mobile devices as we speak.

87
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:33,724
And as for the identity of the attackers...

88
00:12:46,214 --> 00:12:47,889
Kneel!

89
00:12:51,408 --> 00:12:52,664
You're welcome.

90
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:59,449
Let our gracious response to this incursion be an olive branch.

91
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:04,391
Further attempts on our resources...

92
00:13:04,558 --> 00:13:07,657
will be considered an act of aggression...

93
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:11,595
and met with a much steeper response.

94
00:13:13,312 --> 00:13:15,783
We mourn the loss of our king.

95
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:21,395
But do not think for a second that Wakanda has lost her ability...

96
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:24,118
to protect our resources.

97
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,245
We are aware of the ongoing efforts by some...

98
00:13:28,453 --> 00:13:31,745
to find vibranium outside of Wakanda...

99
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:36,070
and wish you the best of luck.

100
00:13:40,648 --> 00:13:44,319
This is Rotor 625 requesting clearance to land.

101
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:49,534
All right. Meet you down there.

102
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:50,702
Yeah.

103
00:13:53,206 --> 00:13:54,290
Hey!

104
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,293
I thought you retired!

105
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,503
I thought I had too.

106
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:01,007
They said that machine had a one in a billion chance of finding vibranium.

107
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,342
Oh, less than that.

108
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:25,414
Here we go.

109
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:29,419
Cabin pressure is stable at negative one P-S-I.

110
00:14:34,843 --> 00:14:36,177
At 800 feet...

111
00:14:36,345 --> 00:14:38,306
passing through thermocline.

112
00:14:38,472 --> 00:14:40,100
All my life supports in the green.

113
00:14:42,352 --> 00:14:43,313
Copy you.

114
00:14:52,616 --> 00:14:54,076
We've touched down.

115
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:05,174
Perfect. So, Salazar, you are near the site right there.

116
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:08,595
Yeah, it's astonishing.

117
00:15:10,598 --> 00:15:13,393
The drill seemed to make contact with a metallic substance.

118
00:15:14,353 --> 00:15:16,355
Whatever it is, it's solid.

119
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:19,067
I've never seen a drill bit chewed up like this before.

120
00:15:22,613 --> 00:15:23,698
I'll be.

121
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:25,951
Vibranium in the ocean.

122
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,828
Let's go ahead and get the detector out of there...

123
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:29,914
since it's the only one we've got.

124
00:15:30,874 --> 00:15:33,210
Heading towards the vibranium detector.

125
00:15:45,226 --> 00:15:46,352
Okay, Salazar, we just went dark.

126
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,063
Yeah. The rig lost power.

127
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:50,489
Copy that. I'm gonna fix it up here.

128
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:07,118
What the hell was that?

129
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:22,462
Jackson...

130
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:24,385
tell me you're seeing this?

131
00:16:24,678 --> 00:16:26,475
Hang on. Salazar's heart rate.

132
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,859
Hey, Salazar, can you give me a visual?

133
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,955
It's a phantom jellyfish.

134
00:16:33,177 --> 00:16:34,637
I've never seen one this color.

135
00:16:35,478 --> 00:16:36,980
Emergency dive team, stand by.

136
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:39,898
Salazar, we just lost Jackson's vitals.

137
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,232
Can you see him?

138
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:51,031
No. He's gone.

139
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:53,158
Can you clarify? What do you mean by, "He's gone"?

140
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:56,327
Salazar, do you copy?

141
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,870
Salazar?

142
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:04,707
Smitty, we got a situation out here.

143
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:17,634
What's that sound?

144
00:17:18,008 --> 00:17:19,801
West, you got a visual on what's making that sound?

145
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:27,807
West, how copy, over?

146
00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:32,352
West, you got a visual?

147
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,908
It's some kind of sonic attack.

148
00:17:53,158 --> 00:17:54,868
Hey, Smitty, earplugs.

149
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,165
We are under attack.

150
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,166
You need to send in a strike team immediately.

151
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,211
Copy. Mayday, mayday, this is Rotor 625.

152
00:18:08,294 --> 00:18:09,753
We are requesting assistance immediately.

153
00:18:09,962 --> 00:18:10,963
It's the Wakandans.

154
00:18:13,422 --> 00:18:14,507
It has to be.

155
00:18:30,351 --> 00:18:31,345
Henderson.

156
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:32,878
Smitty, we gotta go.

157
00:18:33,292 --> 00:18:34,329
Henderson!

158
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:36,399
Let's go.

159
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:40,209
What's going on?

160
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:41,948
Get off the edge.

161
00:18:58,511 --> 00:18:59,563
Go!

162
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:21,503
Go, go, go!

163
00:19:28,894 --> 00:19:29,938
Now! Go!

164
00:19:30,189 --> 00:19:31,691
Spin! Spin them off!

165
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:34,656
Okay. They're gone!

166
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:35,909
Oh, my God!

167
00:19:55,574 --> 00:19:56,576
Just get us out.

168
00:19:56,911 --> 00:19:57,955
We're good.

169
00:19:58,414 --> 00:19:59,375
We're good.

170
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,794
Where is the strike team?

171
00:20:00,961 --> 00:20:03,008
It wasn't the Wakandans. They were blue.

172
00:20:03,174 --> 00:20:04,302
Everyone is dead...

173
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,788
Shit. What is going on?

174
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:08,974
We're getting pulled backwards.

175
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,477
Oh, my God.

176
00:20:17,903 --> 00:20:19,030
Oh, God! Hang on!

177
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:55,829
Queen Ramonda of the nation of Wakanda...

178
00:20:55,913 --> 00:20:58,208
gave an electrifying speech at the UN yesterday...

179
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,170
while members of her military escorted captive mercenaries...

180
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:03,048
onto the floor of the UN.

181
00:21:03,173 --> 00:21:04,841
A year has passed since Queen Ramonda...

182
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,969
was reinstated as ruler of Wakanda...

183
00:21:07,136 --> 00:21:10,557
after King T'Challa's sudden death from an undisclosed illness last year.

184
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:12,727
All eyes are on the tiny, powerful nation...

185
00:21:12,936 --> 00:21:15,564
as it finds itself increasingly isolated...

186
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:17,442
My Queen.

187
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,862
Approaching the river border.

188
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:28,207
We are home.

189
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:19,109
Princess.

190
00:22:19,276 --> 00:22:21,696
Just a moment. I'm in the middle of something.

191
00:22:21,863 --> 00:22:23,199
I understand, Princess, however...

192
00:22:23,365 --> 00:22:25,117
You're disrupting my train of thought.

193
00:22:28,622 --> 00:22:29,665
Shuri.

194
00:22:30,124 --> 00:22:31,077
Mother.

195
00:22:31,236 --> 00:22:33,977
I was trying to tell you. The Queen is here.

196
00:22:34,414 --> 00:22:36,042
- Thank you. - That thing unnerves me.

197
00:22:36,598 --> 00:22:39,815
I think that one day artificial intelligence is going to kill us all.

198
00:22:39,974 --> 00:22:44,422
My AI isn't like the movies, Mother. It does exactly what I tell it to do.

199
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:46,806
Yeah, if only children were the same.

200
00:22:47,957 --> 00:22:50,658
Everyone seems to be working diligently.

201
00:22:51,254 --> 00:22:54,591
Yes. Rapid emergency response task.

202
00:22:55,186 --> 00:22:56,417
There could be any number of...

203
00:22:56,536 --> 00:22:59,863
unknown threats on the horizon, and they're creating solutions.

204
00:23:00,928 --> 00:23:02,975
Oh, what is this?

205
00:23:03,189 --> 00:23:04,851
Exo Suits for our army.

206
00:23:05,065 --> 00:23:09,669
It grants the user super-human strength, speed, and durability.

207
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,442
But, as always, Okoye had notes.

208
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:13,678
What were her notes?

209
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,214
She hates them.

210
00:23:20,843 --> 00:23:23,146
What about recreating the Heart-Shaped Herb?

211
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:25,321
Have you made any progress on that?

212
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,686
Excuse me, Princess.

213
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,971
Nakia, daughter of Yaa, is trying to reach you again.

214
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:31,207
Maybe you should...

215
00:23:31,463 --> 00:23:33,083
Maybe you should continue your calculations...

216
00:23:33,297 --> 00:23:34,321
as I instructed.

217
00:23:34,576 --> 00:23:36,197
As you wish, Princess.

218
00:23:37,562 --> 00:23:42,211
We do not need the Herb, Mother. We need new technology.

219
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:43,576
What of the Black Panther?

220
00:23:46,987 --> 00:23:50,570
The mantle has unified our nation for centuries.

221
00:23:50,741 --> 00:23:52,958
The Black Panther is a relic, Mother.

222
00:23:53,129 --> 00:23:55,560
I wasn't trying to save the mantle with the Herb...

223
00:23:55,731 --> 00:23:57,948
I was trying to save my brother.

224
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:01,128
Oh, Shuri.

225
00:24:15,214 --> 00:24:16,554
Do you know what day it is?

226
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:18,525
Tuesday.

227
00:24:19,407 --> 00:24:20,876
The date, child.

228
00:24:27,086 --> 00:24:28,513
Brother's passing.

229
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:30,610
One year ago today.

230
00:24:40,388 --> 00:24:41,468
Have you planned anything?

231
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:45,539
Yes. It involves you taking your mother for a drive.

232
00:24:46,204 --> 00:24:47,533
- Right now? - Right now.

233
00:24:48,156 --> 00:24:49,777
And you can leave your Kimoyo Beads here.

234
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:50,856
- Mother. - No, no.

235
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:53,100
You won't need them where we are going.

236
00:24:57,918 --> 00:25:00,744
And the other two. Yes.

237
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:28,246
You need to sit here with me. And with yourself.

238
00:25:28,453 --> 00:25:30,904
It is the only way you are going to heal...

239
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,231
from the wound caused by T'Challa's death.

240
00:25:33,356 --> 00:25:34,644
I'm fine, Mother.

241
00:25:36,181 --> 00:25:38,133
You don't have to worry about me.

242
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:42,869
He's gone, but I'm moving forward.

243
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:47,812
T'Challa is dead, but that doesn't mean he is gone.

244
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,094
When that illness took your brother from us...

245
00:25:51,303 --> 00:25:55,831
I had to lead a wounded nation and a broken world.

246
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:58,655
But I still took time in the bush.

247
00:25:58,864 --> 00:26:02,104
I wandered until I found water.

248
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,566
And I sat.

249
00:26:05,281 --> 00:26:06,911
Then I did this ritual...

250
00:26:07,078 --> 00:26:09,545
that I am about to show you now.

251
00:26:12,012 --> 00:26:16,235
I found your brother in the breeze...

252
00:26:17,615 --> 00:26:21,002
pushing me gently, but firm.

253
00:26:22,005 --> 00:26:24,180
Like his hand on my shoulder.

254
00:26:26,605 --> 00:26:27,984
It took some time...

255
00:26:29,406 --> 00:26:31,413
but he was there.

256
00:26:37,601 --> 00:26:39,065
He wasn't there, Mother.

257
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:42,243
The presence that you felt...

258
00:26:42,326 --> 00:26:44,333
was just a construct of your mind.

259
00:26:46,424 --> 00:26:50,271
Brought on so you could feel some comfort or joy.

260
00:26:50,772 --> 00:26:52,403
That's all.

261
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,094
What construct does your mind create...

262
00:27:02,261 --> 00:27:04,220
when you think of your brother?

263
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:07,221
Does it offer you comfort?

264
00:27:08,554 --> 00:27:10,013
Or torment?

265
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,683
Come, child.

266
00:27:36,395 --> 00:27:37,479
How did you get this?

267
00:27:37,562 --> 00:27:38,729
What does it matter?

268
00:27:39,521 --> 00:27:41,355
What does this have to do with your ritual?

269
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:44,814
Burning of the funeral garments...

270
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,315
marks the end of the mourning period...

271
00:27:47,481 --> 00:27:50,273
and the beginning of a new relationship...

272
00:27:50,482 --> 00:27:52,733
with our loved ones that have passed on...

273
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:54,817
I'm not doing this, Mother.

274
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,507
If I sit...

275
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:00,306
and think about my brother for too long...

276
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:04,658
it won't be these clothes I'll burn.

277
00:28:05,823 --> 00:28:07,361
It will be the world...

278
00:28:08,858 --> 00:28:10,314
and everyone in it.

279
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:12,684
Shuri...

280
00:28:17,133 --> 00:28:20,043
Shuri, there's something that I need to tell you...

281
00:28:20,585 --> 00:28:21,874
about your brother.

282
00:28:26,364 --> 00:28:27,363
Mother, wait!

283
00:28:27,945 --> 00:28:29,360
What are you doing?

284
00:28:54,577 --> 00:28:56,450
This better not be a part of your ritual.

285
00:28:56,658 --> 00:28:57,907
It isn't.

286
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,194
Stop! Right there!

287
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:04,731
Who are you? And how did you get in here?

288
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,769
This place is amazing.

289
00:29:08,684 --> 00:29:10,765
The air is pristine.

290
00:29:12,222 --> 00:29:13,220
And the water...

291
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,799
My mother told stories about a place like this.

292
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:20,336
A protected land with people that never have to leave.

293
00:29:20,544 --> 00:29:22,832
That never have to change who they were.

294
00:29:24,456 --> 00:29:27,410
What reason do you have to reveal your secret to the world?

295
00:29:27,618 --> 00:29:30,406
I am not a woman who enjoys repeating herself.

296
00:29:30,573 --> 00:29:32,445
Who are you?

297
00:29:32,612 --> 00:29:33,860
I have many names.

298
00:29:34,443 --> 00:29:37,522
My people call me K'uk'ulkan...

299
00:29:40,393 --> 00:29:42,183
but my enemies call me Namor.

300
00:29:43,972 --> 00:29:48,175
The American military detected vibranium under my nation's domain.

301
00:29:49,174 --> 00:29:52,711
I was able to stop them from minin' it...

302
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:56,748
but we need Wakanda's help to prevent it from happenin' again.

303
00:29:57,871 --> 00:30:00,936
They use a machine designed by an American scientist.

304
00:30:01,109 --> 00:30:03,583
Vibranium only exists here.

305
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:05,135
In Wakanda.

306
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,644
Mother, he's covered in it.

307
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:14,318
Your son exposed the power of vibranium to the world.

308
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:18,763
In response, other nations have begun searching the planet for it.

309
00:30:18,974 --> 00:30:22,287
His choice has compromised us.

310
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:26,899
I think Wakanda could find the scientist and bring them to me?

311
00:30:27,654 --> 00:30:31,638
It is only fair that Wakanda helps to resolve our dilemma.

312
00:30:31,847 --> 00:30:37,131
You do not sneak into my country and tell me what is fair.

313
00:30:38,641 --> 00:30:41,744
I have more soldiers than this land has blades of grass.

314
00:30:42,457 --> 00:30:45,309
And they have incomparable strength.

315
00:30:45,728 --> 00:30:48,873
I would hate to come back under different circumstances.

316
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:57,421
When you have the scientist, blow into this...

317
00:30:57,676 --> 00:30:59,037
place it in the ocean.

318
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,461
I'll be there shortly afterwards.

319
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:06,394
For your own sake...

320
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,648
don't mention anything about me to anyone outside of Wakanda.

321
00:31:19,621 --> 00:31:21,535
Did you see the wings on his ankles?

322
00:31:38,334 --> 00:31:39,439
How did he do that?

323
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:41,905
We must convene the Council.

324
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:47,477
Heaven Scrapers had no evidence of any activity at all.

325
00:31:49,604 --> 00:31:53,601
Oh, the river border has been breached?

326
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,110
If my soldiers were present...

327
00:31:56,451 --> 00:31:58,747
this "fish man"...

328
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:00,661
would be bound before us as we speak.

329
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:03,171
If your muscle brains were present...

330
00:32:03,383 --> 00:32:06,530
they would still be there choking on their fuzzy adornments.

331
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,891
You bald-headed demon...

332
00:32:08,061 --> 00:32:09,890
Show some respect, you two.

333
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,080
Respect?

334
00:32:11,293 --> 00:32:13,760
These men should be ashamed to show their faces!

335
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:14,913
Watch your tone, Jabari!

336
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:30,390
As I was saying...

337
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,296
there was no aerial surveillance footage of him.

338
00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:34,793
And nothing on the radar as well.

339
00:32:34,963 --> 00:32:38,555
So, he swam underwater for 100 kilometers.

340
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:42,616
He was not alone. And claims to command a massive army.

341
00:32:42,744 --> 00:32:47,190
He wants us to deliver one American scientist?

342
00:32:47,362 --> 00:32:48,388
So he can kill them?

343
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:49,542
Do it.

344
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:55,570
We never had to face an enemy with access to vibranium before.

345
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,477
And we have no Black Panther to protect us.

346
00:32:58,648 --> 00:33:03,094
That is because this wise Council allowed Killmonger to take the throne...

347
00:33:03,308 --> 00:33:05,147
and burn up all of your precious Heart-Shaped Herb.

348
00:33:05,403 --> 00:33:07,925
M'Baku, what would you have us do?

349
00:33:08,095 --> 00:33:10,490
We should find the fish man and kill him.

350
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,407
If we do what he is asking for now...

351
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:19,950
what is to stop him from coming back and asking for more?

352
00:33:29,503 --> 00:33:30,563
As you were.

353
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:36,635
Is it just me, or does this keep getting uglier?

354
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:37,908
It's you.

355
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,752
- So, does it work? - Yes.

356
00:33:40,922 --> 00:33:44,659
This thing can detect the altered frequency of vibranium...

357
00:33:44,828 --> 00:33:49,880
through water, stones, even heavy metals. Whoever built this is brilliant.

358
00:33:50,305 --> 00:33:51,663
Come, look.

359
00:33:52,343 --> 00:33:54,932
Some are custom parts and others look like...

360
00:33:55,102 --> 00:33:56,927
they gathered it from a junkyard.

361
00:33:57,054 --> 00:33:59,729
I am still struggling to believe...

362
00:33:59,984 --> 00:34:02,489
that vibranium exists outside of Wakanda.

363
00:34:02,702 --> 00:34:04,994
Perhaps there was more than one meteorite.

364
00:34:05,164 --> 00:34:08,008
Our planet is covered of mostly water, so it's reasonable...

365
00:34:08,178 --> 00:34:10,258
that the other one just landed there.

366
00:34:10,428 --> 00:34:12,551
This changes everything that we know.

367
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,202
The Great Mound. All of the legends and fables.

368
00:34:17,008 --> 00:34:18,877
Those stories are seared in my mind.

369
00:34:19,088 --> 00:34:20,872
That sounds very painful.

370
00:34:23,207 --> 00:34:25,202
So we have to find this scientist after all.

371
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:27,957
I do have an idea.

372
00:34:29,384 --> 00:34:30,667
I'm going to need the princess.

373
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:32,848
Out of the question.

374
00:34:33,019 --> 00:34:35,157
She is in no state to be in the field.

375
00:34:35,244 --> 00:34:36,655
My Queen,

376
00:34:37,724 --> 00:34:40,290
it may do her some good to get out.

377
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:43,498
It might just be exactly what she needs.

378
00:34:44,097 --> 00:34:48,203
Besides, I can do this American operation with my eyes closed.

379
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:51,710
It's not the Americans that I'm worried about.

380
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,334
This Namor...

381
00:34:53,761 --> 00:34:55,685
he snuck past our defenses.

382
00:34:55,856 --> 00:34:57,822
That will never happen again.

383
00:34:58,035 --> 00:34:59,574
He was not alone.

384
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:01,668
She'll be with me.

385
00:35:02,864 --> 00:35:03,848
So...

386
00:35:04,874 --> 00:35:05,984
when are we leavin'...

387
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,250
so I can see my favorite colonizer?

388
00:35:38,165 --> 00:35:39,234
Come on.

389
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,738
Yeah, I got it.

390
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:45,088
I got it.

391
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,638
Will you slow down?

392
00:35:55,635 --> 00:35:56,969
You didn't think to call?

393
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,122
Now, why would I have your number?

394
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,501
We are looking for the scientist who built the vibranium detector.

395
00:36:04,802 --> 00:36:06,223
So it was you guys in the Atlantic?

396
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,933
Come on. Mining ship.

397
00:36:09,106 --> 00:36:10,483
Lot of casualties.

398
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,161
What happened?

399
00:36:12,377 --> 00:36:13,453
Seriously?

400
00:36:15,518 --> 00:36:18,488
It was a joint operation. Us and the SEALs.

401
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:21,672
Thirty of their top guys, two of our best officers...

402
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,867
friends of mine.

403
00:36:23,356 --> 00:36:24,373
Gone.

404
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:25,602
Just like that.

405
00:36:26,364 --> 00:36:28,059
You throw in the fact that they were tracking vibranium...

406
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,983
I can assure you Wakanda had nothing to do with this.

407
00:36:31,914 --> 00:36:33,024
So who was it?

408
00:36:34,561 --> 00:36:36,482
God, look, the way that this is supposed to work...

409
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,743
is that I give you information and you reciprocate.

410
00:36:38,872 --> 00:36:41,689
For our own safety, we cannot tell you.

411
00:36:41,817 --> 00:36:43,951
It's imperative that we get to the scientist...

412
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,658
before anything else happens.

413
00:36:46,427 --> 00:36:48,220
You owe me, Ross.

414
00:36:48,305 --> 00:36:50,012
You owe my brother.

415
00:36:53,854 --> 00:36:54,878
Okay, look.

416
00:36:55,732 --> 00:36:57,994
There are agents who have been sentenced to death...

417
00:36:58,207 --> 00:37:00,341
for less than I'm about to give you now.

418
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:01,835
And we got a new director.

419
00:37:02,474 --> 00:37:03,925
She's watching me like a hawk.

420
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,698
We will be very, very careful.

421
00:37:06,827 --> 00:37:08,875
Not just careful, you gotta be fast.

422
00:37:09,131 --> 00:37:10,667
The US needs another machine...

423
00:37:10,753 --> 00:37:12,374
and this kid is the only person in the world...

424
00:37:12,502 --> 00:37:13,526
who knows how to build one.

425
00:37:13,654 --> 00:37:14,763
So they're comin' for her.

426
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:15,884
A kid?

427
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,143
Hey.

428
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:28,380
You forgot to Venmo me.

429
00:37:28,465 --> 00:37:31,580
It slipped my mind. It's eight hundred, right?

430
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,694
Eight hundred was yesterday's price. It's a band today.

431
00:37:34,865 --> 00:37:36,400
That's predatory.

432
00:37:37,893 --> 00:37:39,515
I built the whole robotic hand.

433
00:37:39,727 --> 00:37:42,244
You just corrected the grip algorithm.

434
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,781
And what grade did you get?

435
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,473
Thanks.

436
00:37:54,543 --> 00:37:55,668
Is that an iPhone I see?

437
00:37:55,883 --> 00:37:56,921
Primitive.

438
00:37:58,435 --> 00:37:59,502
My Queen.

439
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,275
We have located the scientist.

440
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:06,115
She is in the American equivalent of a Wakandan village school.

441
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:07,522
A school?

442
00:38:08,034 --> 00:38:10,423
Please tell me it is a professor.

443
00:38:10,594 --> 00:38:12,429
It's a student, Mother.

444
00:38:12,598 --> 00:38:14,178
We can't give her to Namor.

445
00:38:14,988 --> 00:38:17,633
Bring this student back to Wakanda.

446
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,832
Yes, my Queen.

447
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,416
I've got it from here.

448
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:26,976
Wait. Maybe I should speak with her.

449
00:38:27,189 --> 00:38:28,426
It will be more discreet.

450
00:38:29,748 --> 00:38:30,900
I can be discreet.

451
00:38:34,697 --> 00:38:35,702
What?

452
00:38:36,162 --> 00:38:37,251
- Nothing. - Is it the makeup?

453
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,486
No.

454
00:38:38,658 --> 00:38:40,795
- It's the wrong shade, isn't it? - It's the right shade.

455
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,592
Fenty 440. You look good.

456
00:38:44,217 --> 00:38:46,354
I can blend in as a student.

457
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:48,493
I can do this.

458
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,881
- You get five minutes. - Yes!

459
00:39:06,583 --> 00:39:07,609
Yo!

460
00:39:07,737 --> 00:39:08,868
Riri Williams?

461
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,933
Yo, I don't do drop-bys no more. You gotta go to the website.

462
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,335
It's an encrypted file.

463
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,688
I wanted to airdrop it.

464
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:22,034
You the...

465
00:39:24,557 --> 00:39:26,211
You're Princess Shuri.

466
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:29,397
What the hell are you doing here?

467
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:31,093
Oh, shit, am I getting recruited?

468
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:33,868
No.

469
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:38,060
I'm here about the vibranium detector that you built for the CIA.

470
00:39:39,486 --> 00:39:43,547
I ain't built no detector for no CIA. I made that for my metallurgy class.

471
00:39:43,721 --> 00:39:45,752
- A school project? - Yeah.

472
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,042
My professor said I'd never be able to do it.

473
00:39:49,728 --> 00:39:51,932
To be young, gifted, and Black though, right?

474
00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:57,420
Y'all probably don't say that in Wakanda.

475
00:39:59,753 --> 00:40:00,790
How old are you?

476
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:03,167
Nineteen.

477
00:40:03,686 --> 00:40:07,618
Brilliance at a young age is not always accepted by the elders.

478
00:40:09,131 --> 00:40:10,686
How long did it take you?

479
00:40:10,903 --> 00:40:12,026
Couple months.

480
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,841
- Couple months? - The hardest part was...

481
00:40:14,014 --> 00:40:15,959
finding big enough mylar sheets to cover the...

482
00:40:17,817 --> 00:40:19,286
Wait, did I piss off Wakanda?

483
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:20,463
Not just us.

484
00:40:21,174 --> 00:40:22,554
This place is no longer safe for you.

485
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:25,900
Gather your things and come with me. Right now.

486
00:40:26,736 --> 00:40:29,706
I got Differential Equations class in, like, 15 minutes.

487
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,344
Okay.

488
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,692
Okay.

489
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:38,171
You wait right here.

490
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:41,779
I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I'm just gonna...

491
00:40:45,432 --> 00:40:47,084
I had it under control.

492
00:40:47,997 --> 00:40:50,365
I said five minutes. I gave you six.

493
00:40:50,517 --> 00:40:52,183
Get out. Get out of my dorm.

494
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,019
Get out!

495
00:40:54,189 --> 00:40:55,214
Hey.

496
00:40:55,428 --> 00:40:59,356
I'm warning you! Do not take another step toward me!

497
00:40:59,442 --> 00:41:01,576
See how they teach the children to treat their guests?

498
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:08,706
You brought a spear in here?

499
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:11,183
You brought a spear in here.

500
00:41:12,038 --> 00:41:13,147
I like her.

501
00:41:13,617 --> 00:41:16,007
Hey, hey, hey. Put it down, put it...

502
00:41:16,178 --> 00:41:17,588
You'll hurt yourself. Come on.

503
00:41:18,271 --> 00:41:19,851
It's all right, Princess.

504
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:21,430
Small, small girl.

505
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:25,487
I am going to give you two options.

506
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,920
You can come to Wakanda...

507
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:30,397
conscious or unconscious.

508
00:41:31,251 --> 00:41:34,026
You need to be conscious of the way that you look.

509
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,289
Walking round here, all that ash on your head.

510
00:41:38,168 --> 00:41:40,260
- Oh, it's funny? - No, it's not.

511
00:41:41,028 --> 00:41:42,950
- I told you! - You look good.

512
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,530
Calm down. We'll leave, okay?

513
00:41:45,256 --> 00:41:49,483
And she can deal with that merman with the winged ankles...

514
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:52,642
who wants to kill her all by herself.

515
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:54,948
- You got this. - With your heater.

516
00:41:55,118 --> 00:41:56,314
Come on. Let's go.

517
00:41:56,997 --> 00:41:58,100
What?

518
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,298
What exactly is this place?

519
00:42:07,976 --> 00:42:10,010
I fixed a few trucks for the head of sanitation.

520
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:14,716
He lets me work out of this garage in exchange.

521
00:42:15,181 --> 00:42:16,835
I just have to grab my work laptop.

522
00:42:19,547 --> 00:42:22,388
Please don't touch anything.

523
00:42:22,472 --> 00:42:24,676
You don't have to worry about that.

524
00:42:24,889 --> 00:42:28,618
It may not look like much, but it's my life's work in here.

525
00:42:29,678 --> 00:42:33,069
So, the design for the machine is on that laptop?

526
00:42:33,238 --> 00:42:34,256
Yeah.

527
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,350
And you just leave it on a desk in a car garage?

528
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,529
I got 2065-byte encryption on that thing.

529
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:43,878
That's impressive. Ever locked yourself out?

530
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:46,039
Took me the whole semester to get back in.

531
00:42:46,209 --> 00:42:48,286
Had to build a functional quantum computer...

532
00:42:48,498 --> 00:42:50,405
just to crack my own encryption.

533
00:42:50,618 --> 00:42:52,991
What is it you're building here? Is it Stark Tech?

534
00:42:53,245 --> 00:42:55,068
I said don't touch anything.

535
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:57,823
Princess, American law enforcement has arrived at your location.

536
00:42:58,034 --> 00:42:59,434
- Shit. - Who was that?

537
00:42:59,815 --> 00:43:00,832
My AI.

538
00:43:02,528 --> 00:43:03,970
They are surrounding us.

539
00:43:07,996 --> 00:43:10,764
I thought you said a merman was after me.

540
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:11,956
That's the feds.

541
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:28,194
I do not need this shit right now!

542
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,496
I swear to God, I was doing so well!

543
00:43:30,667 --> 00:43:33,395
Goin' to class on time. I must be dumb as hell.

544
00:43:33,607 --> 00:43:36,250
Real dumb thinking that the Princess of Wakanda...

545
00:43:36,421 --> 00:43:39,660
is gonna show up at my doorstep and then shit about to pop off.

546
00:43:39,915 --> 00:43:43,581
I think that I'm actually gonna take my chances with this merman...

547
00:43:43,795 --> 00:43:47,417
because at least he never brought the FBI to my garage!

548
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:51,040
Hey. Namor sank an entire ship of CIA operatives...

549
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,876
- This is the Federal Bureau of Investigation. - ...because of your little machine.

550
00:43:54,961 --> 00:43:56,965
- So those popo out there... - We have surrounded the premises.

551
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,797
...are the very least of your worries.

552
00:43:58,968 --> 00:44:01,483
Listen, we need to work together to get out of here.

553
00:44:01,696 --> 00:44:04,210
General, they've got us surrounded.

554
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:05,958
Maybe we should just split up.

555
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:07,621
Out of the question.

556
00:44:07,705 --> 00:44:08,899
Does this vehicle work?

557
00:44:10,391 --> 00:44:11,573
No.

558
00:44:12,586 --> 00:44:15,922
Everything in this lab works. Including this bike.

559
00:44:16,132 --> 00:44:20,101
Don't even think about it. Besides, there are three of us.

560
00:44:20,354 --> 00:44:22,760
Two of y'all. I'm takin' this.

561
00:44:24,576 --> 00:44:25,758
I knew it.

562
00:44:25,926 --> 00:44:28,417
Don't tell me that you built this in two months.

563
00:44:28,756 --> 00:44:31,584
I spent years on this. On and off.

564
00:44:32,048 --> 00:44:34,539
Nice. Have you flown it yet?

565
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:35,806
That thing can fly?

566
00:44:35,975 --> 00:44:39,310
There's an entire YouTube channel dedicated to sightings of me.

567
00:44:39,985 --> 00:44:41,096
That's awesome.

568
00:44:41,437 --> 00:44:43,232
- We have a warrant to detain... - Come.

569
00:44:43,403 --> 00:44:44,642
...the student Riri Williams.

570
00:44:44,727 --> 00:44:46,008
Wireless transmitter...

571
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:48,529
- so we can communicate. - Don't try to scurry off.

572
00:44:48,657 --> 00:44:50,750
General Okoye, Princess Shuri...

573
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,014
come out with your hands up.

574
00:44:53,698 --> 00:44:54,765
What a hunk of junk.

575
00:44:54,936 --> 00:44:57,114
Hey, please be careful.

576
00:44:57,371 --> 00:44:59,422
- You will not be placed under arrest. - Keys are on the seat.

577
00:44:59,592 --> 00:45:01,130
Once we get to the other side of the bridge...

578
00:45:01,343 --> 00:45:02,497
we can lose them in Boston traffic.

579
00:45:02,753 --> 00:45:04,548
General, we really need to split up.

580
00:45:04,633 --> 00:45:08,050
Listen to me. We are not in your lab. We are in the field.

581
00:45:08,179 --> 00:45:09,631
Now, get her in the car.

582
00:45:10,314 --> 00:45:11,339
Always shouting at me.

583
00:45:18,431 --> 00:45:23,642
The tactical unit will breach the entrance in three, two...

584
00:45:23,813 --> 00:45:25,180
one.

585
00:45:26,504 --> 00:45:28,255
FBI! Don't move!

586
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:29,921
What the hell is that?

587
00:45:30,178 --> 00:45:33,039
Oh, shit! She got an Iron Man suit? Fall back!

588
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:34,620
Stay where you are!

589
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:39,362
Guess it can fly.

590
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:40,814
- GRIOT! - Yes, Princess.

591
00:45:41,028 --> 00:45:42,565
- Now! - Remote piloting activated.

592
00:45:42,779 --> 00:45:44,017
Shuri! No!

593
00:45:54,269 --> 00:45:55,637
Let's go!

594
00:45:56,918 --> 00:45:57,882
GRIOT.

595
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,325
Give me a visual.

596
00:46:08,581 --> 00:46:09,943
- GRIOT... - Yes, General?

597
00:46:10,028 --> 00:46:11,986
...take me to the princess...

598
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,922
or I will drive my spear so deep into your CPU...

599
00:46:15,093 --> 00:46:18,284
you will not be able to process basic input for a millennia.

600
00:46:18,412 --> 00:46:19,645
Just one moment, General.

601
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:21,357
Okoye, I'm on my way to you.

602
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,934
GRIOT, give me control of this vehicle right now!

603
00:46:36,104 --> 00:46:38,229
I am clearing you a path.

604
00:46:43,029 --> 00:46:44,346
She's all yours, General.

605
00:46:44,558 --> 00:46:46,426
Manual drive engaged.

606
00:47:03,461 --> 00:47:04,991
We need to find an extraction point.

607
00:47:05,161 --> 00:47:06,648
There's one across the river.

608
00:47:12,977 --> 00:47:14,591
Hey, yo, they cuttin' off the bridge.

609
00:47:18,882 --> 00:47:21,855
Princess, there is a surveillance drone locked onto you.

610
00:47:21,941 --> 00:47:22,960
How high?

611
00:47:23,129 --> 00:47:24,446
Thirty-thousand feet.

612
00:47:30,606 --> 00:47:31,602
Hang on.

613
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:33,331
I got it.

614
00:47:37,081 --> 00:47:38,104
Come on, Riri.

615
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:40,832
You gotta find these differential equations.

616
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,792
Once the relative velocity evens out...

617
00:47:43,006 --> 00:47:44,796
Riri, I'm not sure you can reach that drone...

618
00:47:44,924 --> 00:47:45,988
without an oxygen mask.

619
00:47:48,717 --> 00:47:51,401
Oxygen level is now 55%.

620
00:47:52,382 --> 00:47:54,300
Twenty-eight thousand feet.

621
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,391
Oxygen level is now 30%.

622
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,656
Maximum acceleration. I just need to adjust my Euler angles and that should...

623
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,702
drop it right on the...

624
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:15,225
Oxygen, 0%.

625
00:48:18,678 --> 00:48:20,681
The drone is no longer tracking you.

626
00:48:21,619 --> 00:48:23,665
Altitude, 500 feet and falling.

627
00:48:23,835 --> 00:48:25,028
Riri! Are you okay?

628
00:48:26,349 --> 00:48:27,415
- Riri! - Yeah.

629
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,299
I'm good.

630
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:34,255
- Incoming! - Get out of the way!

631
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:35,511
Oh my!

632
00:48:35,672 --> 00:48:36,706
- Shit! - And no worries.

633
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:38,903
I got a special delivery for y'all in three...

634
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:40,453
two, one...

635
00:48:42,175 --> 00:48:43,252
Nice one, Riri!

636
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:53,574
Riri!

637
00:49:22,205 --> 00:49:24,584
What just happened? Shuri!

638
00:49:25,051 --> 00:49:26,072
Shuri!

639
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:44,826
The Princess's vitals are stable, General.

640
00:49:44,997 --> 00:49:47,591
She should regain consciousness momentarily.

641
00:50:22,762 --> 00:50:24,889
Take another step closer...

642
00:50:25,654 --> 00:50:27,228
and I will kill you all.

643
00:50:27,908 --> 00:50:28,929
Drop your weapons!

644
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,012
Kill the scientist.

645
00:50:33,182 --> 00:50:34,883
I'll deal with the witnesses.

646
00:50:35,096 --> 00:50:36,117
OK.

647
00:50:37,945 --> 00:50:39,093
Hey, is she blue?

648
00:50:41,093 --> 00:50:42,751
Kill that woman first.

649
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:45,048
Drop your weapon!

650
00:51:19,756 --> 00:51:21,882
Go to Namora.

651
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,954
You're not worth my blade.

652
00:52:47,884 --> 00:52:49,373
What's taking so long?

653
00:52:49,798 --> 00:52:52,393
This is not a time for games.

654
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:02,898
Okoye!

655
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:05,487
Wait!

656
00:53:05,697 --> 00:53:06,964
Activating interpretation.

657
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:08,104
I'm Shuri.

658
00:53:08,232 --> 00:53:09,583
Princess of Wakanda.

659
00:53:10,132 --> 00:53:11,906
I demand that you take me to Namor.

660
00:53:12,075 --> 00:53:14,186
Do not bring harm to this girl.

661
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:18,960
Do we take them both alive?

662
00:53:19,973 --> 00:53:21,662
Yes, Attuma.

663
00:53:38,176 --> 00:53:39,274
Breathe.

664
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:49,283
Shuri!

665
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:10,655
Ross, from the Agency. You got any witnesses?

666
00:54:10,908 --> 00:54:13,146
None. But we think it was the Wakandans.

667
00:54:13,484 --> 00:54:14,567
Excuse me?

668
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,735
Our field office got a tip from Langley that they were coming.

669
00:54:16,902 --> 00:54:18,777
Right. Who made that call?

670
00:54:19,736 --> 00:54:21,112
- She did. - Director de Fontaine.

671
00:54:23,654 --> 00:54:24,862
Director de Fontaine.

672
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:25,988
Really?

673
00:54:26,113 --> 00:54:27,107
Well...

674
00:54:28,059 --> 00:54:30,046
Agent thinks it was the Wakandans.

675
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:33,069
Yeah, we've been on every one of them since they took out our ship.

676
00:54:33,235 --> 00:54:34,517
That's why I wanted you here.

677
00:54:35,594 --> 00:54:36,588
You're lookin' good.

678
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,410
Well, I try.

679
00:54:38,492 --> 00:54:39,941
You put that home gym in?

680
00:54:40,149 --> 00:54:41,143
Yeah. Last year.

681
00:54:41,308 --> 00:54:43,958
Maybe I'll drop by sometime and jump on your Peloton.

682
00:54:44,704 --> 00:54:45,656
Howdy.

683
00:54:45,738 --> 00:54:46,732
I'm special agent in charge.

684
00:54:46,939 --> 00:54:49,796
Oh, good for you. You wanna walk me through the evidence here, or what?

685
00:54:49,879 --> 00:54:52,032
- Yeah. Okay. After you. - Yeah. Okay.

686
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:53,357
- All right. - So, what happened here?

687
00:54:53,977 --> 00:54:55,551
We think it was a car crash...

688
00:54:55,758 --> 00:54:57,498
but we're having trouble finding the cars.

689
00:54:57,828 --> 00:54:59,899
What do you mean? It was just like this when you found it?

690
00:55:00,105 --> 00:55:02,424
Yes. We think someone involved got rid of the vehicles.

691
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,406
- Got rid of them how? - They dumped them into the river.

692
00:55:05,612 --> 00:55:06,890
You're kidding me.

693
00:55:07,992 --> 00:55:09,754
It's got an MIT sticker on it.

694
00:55:09,842 --> 00:55:12,354
I want that transferred to the NSA immediately.

695
00:55:12,663 --> 00:55:14,822
Hey, Ross? You got a full tank of gas?

696
00:55:15,042 --> 00:55:16,672
Can you give me a ride back to Langley?

697
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:19,184
It's an eight-hour drive.

698
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,726
Yeah. We can talk about the case.

699
00:55:20,815 --> 00:55:22,313
Actually, wouldn't mind...

700
00:55:23,415 --> 00:55:26,983
apologizing to you for a couple of things I said during our marriage.

701
00:55:30,552 --> 00:55:31,786
They were blue.

702
00:55:32,888 --> 00:55:34,915
And they had superhuman strength.

703
00:55:35,884 --> 00:55:38,837
And they came from the water on the backs of whales.

704
00:55:39,761 --> 00:55:43,023
I struck down three of them with blows that should've killed them...

705
00:55:43,242 --> 00:55:45,006
but they rose again.

706
00:55:45,182 --> 00:55:48,619
I wish to leave immediately to retrieve our princess.

707
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,499
Okoye...

708
00:56:02,763 --> 00:56:07,478
you will be stripped of your rank as General of Wakanda's armies...

709
00:56:07,699 --> 00:56:10,782
and your status as Dora Milaje.

710
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:16,777
Permission to speak...

711
00:56:16,854 --> 00:56:17,786
my Queen?

712
00:56:19,106 --> 00:56:20,077
You may.

713
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:21,901
I beg of you.

714
00:56:23,726 --> 00:56:25,163
I have given everything.

715
00:56:26,056 --> 00:56:29,511
Let me die saving my country and that throne.

716
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:31,530
I'm asking you, mother.

717
00:56:31,686 --> 00:56:33,355
Allow me to make this right.

718
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:34,636
"Make it right"?

719
00:56:36,228 --> 00:56:39,140
I do not know if my daughter is alive or dead.

720
00:56:39,217 --> 00:56:42,246
Perhaps we are being too hasty.

721
00:56:44,148 --> 00:56:48,303
She raised a spear against her own husband for Wakanda.

722
00:56:48,496 --> 00:56:50,787
Where is her treacherous husband now...

723
00:56:50,982 --> 00:56:54,981
but in a place where she can visit if she wished? Mine...

724
00:56:56,223 --> 00:56:57,931
is with the ancestors.

725
00:56:58,125 --> 00:57:02,435
I am Queen of the most powerful nation in the world...

726
00:57:02,629 --> 00:57:05,619
and my entire family is gone!

727
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:09,244
Have I not given everything?

728
00:57:18,493 --> 00:57:20,334
On your feet, General.

729
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,745
I stood by you...

730
00:57:28,955 --> 00:57:32,511
after Killmonger took the throne...

731
00:57:32,679 --> 00:57:36,361
and you and the elders in this room stood by him...

732
00:57:36,529 --> 00:57:40,128
while I ran begging to the Jabari for protection.

733
00:57:41,551 --> 00:57:45,944
And I warned you about taking my daughter on this mission...

734
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:48,037
and you lost her.

735
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:50,214
So, today...

736
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:52,473
I am done.

737
00:58:39,553 --> 00:58:42,231
Are you here, GRIOT?

738
00:58:43,528 --> 00:58:44,698
Yes, my Queen.

739
00:58:45,743 --> 00:58:49,169
Were you with Shuri when she was abducted?

740
00:58:49,378 --> 00:58:50,715
I was.

741
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,598
Are you able to track her Kimoyo Beads?

742
00:58:53,807 --> 00:58:56,189
Ballistics found slugs all over Cambridge.

743
00:58:56,397 --> 00:58:58,780
Those Wakandans really took a tour of the city.

744
00:58:58,946 --> 00:59:01,161
I can't see how they figured out who built it.

745
00:59:01,411 --> 00:59:03,751
That information is highly classified.

746
00:59:07,553 --> 00:59:09,559
- What is that? That's a new ringtone? - Oh, shit.

747
00:59:11,064 --> 00:59:12,902
Director, I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to take this.

748
00:59:13,069 --> 00:59:15,033
It's enough with the titles. Just take it. I don't care.

749
00:59:15,242 --> 00:59:16,871
Hey, honey sweetheart.

750
00:59:18,626 --> 00:59:21,134
No, I'm with my boss. Now.

751
00:59:21,927 --> 00:59:23,265
Actually, she's leaving.

752
00:59:23,348 --> 00:59:24,351
All right.

753
00:59:24,518 --> 00:59:27,109
I'm gonna work from home, and then have a shower.

754
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:35,635
Everett Ross.

755
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:36,930
Queen Ramonda?

756
00:59:37,138 --> 00:59:39,053
What are you doing with Shuri's Kimoyo Beads?

757
00:59:39,261 --> 00:59:41,010
I didn't know they were hers. All right?

758
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:43,466
I just found them at a pretty ugly crime scene.

759
00:59:44,506 --> 00:59:45,630
Do you have the student?

760
00:59:46,504 --> 00:59:49,419
Shuri was trying to save her when they were both taken.

761
00:59:50,334 --> 00:59:51,833
What? Taken by who?

762
00:59:53,373 --> 00:59:55,371
My agency assumes it was you.

763
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:57,494
And I'm worried they might be onto the fact...

764
00:59:57,703 --> 00:59:59,826
that I pointed Shuri and Okoye in the right direction.

765
01:00:00,117 --> 01:00:01,615
Look, if they're in danger, I wanna help.

766
01:00:01,782 --> 01:00:03,697
But I can't if I don't know what's going on.

767
01:00:03,864 --> 01:00:06,653
I am afraid there is a new world power at play.

768
01:00:06,986 --> 01:00:09,941
A country that's already on our radar? Or you mean someone else?

769
01:00:10,108 --> 01:00:12,106
That is all I can say for now.

770
01:00:12,314 --> 01:00:13,313
Please...

771
01:00:13,813 --> 01:00:18,142
alert me if your government decides to act on their suspicions.

772
01:00:18,225 --> 01:00:19,974
Yeah. Sure.

773
01:00:20,182 --> 01:00:23,886
Look, if there's anything I can do to help, let me know.

774
01:00:24,095 --> 01:00:25,802
I owe Shuri my life.

775
01:00:26,592 --> 01:00:30,548
GRIOT, did Shuri have her earrings with her?

776
01:00:30,755 --> 01:00:33,211
I lost track of them in the North Atlantic...

777
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:36,583
but the people who took her spoke Yucatec Mayan.

778
01:00:46,449 --> 01:00:47,448
Hello.

779
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:55,695
You're here for the headmistress?

780
01:01:03,167 --> 01:01:04,164
She's there.

781
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:06,782
Very good.

782
01:01:14,178 --> 01:01:15,133
Hello.

783
01:01:21,282 --> 01:01:24,814
Please excuse us for a moment.

784
01:01:28,968 --> 01:01:29,924
Hello.

785
01:01:30,007 --> 01:01:31,004
Hello.

786
01:01:31,129 --> 01:01:32,122
Hello.

787
01:01:37,168 --> 01:01:38,421
Queen Mother.

788
01:01:40,298 --> 01:01:42,552
Everything is a lesson here for the children.

789
01:01:42,718 --> 01:01:45,723
They painted the walls, they feed the fish...

790
01:01:45,807 --> 01:01:48,145
and they grow everything we eat here.

791
01:01:48,311 --> 01:01:51,024
I recognize some of the concepts here.

792
01:01:51,108 --> 01:01:53,111
But you are using different material.

793
01:01:53,194 --> 01:01:56,575
Yes, we use strictly what we can find here in Haiti.

794
01:01:58,578 --> 01:02:01,916
You were missed at T'Challa's funeral.

795
01:02:13,728 --> 01:02:14,938
Queen Mother.

796
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:18,027
It's been six years since you left us.

797
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:21,324
I thought you would at least come back for the ceremony.

798
01:02:24,161 --> 01:02:26,457
I was afraid...

799
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:30,296
of how final the funeral would be.

800
01:02:30,505 --> 01:02:33,426
Nakia, daughter of Yaa...

801
01:02:34,887 --> 01:02:38,685
wherever you go, you are still Wakandan...

802
01:02:38,894 --> 01:02:42,483
and you know death is not the end.

803
01:02:47,574 --> 01:02:48,868
Thank you.

804
01:02:53,668 --> 01:02:55,420
How is everyone at home?

805
01:02:55,587 --> 01:02:57,842
Shuri has been taken.

806
01:02:58,634 --> 01:02:59,637
What?

807
01:02:59,972 --> 01:03:03,066
You have infiltrated many nations before.

808
01:03:03,441 --> 01:03:05,365
That was a long time ago.

809
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:06,744
I was a different person then.

810
01:03:06,912 --> 01:03:09,922
I need someone who can find where she is being held...

811
01:03:10,131 --> 01:03:13,100
and rescue her, without being seen.

812
01:03:13,518 --> 01:03:16,360
Who on earth would risk war with Wakanda?

813
01:03:18,744 --> 01:03:19,835
Oh, my God.

814
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,222
Okay, breathe. Breathe.

815
01:03:21,431 --> 01:03:22,816
Don't tell me to breathe.

816
01:03:22,943 --> 01:03:24,035
Where the hell are we?

817
01:03:24,118 --> 01:03:26,134
We're in a cave. I'm not sure where.

818
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,326
Oh, my God!

819
01:03:28,145 --> 01:03:29,414
What is that?

820
01:03:29,578 --> 01:03:32,279
Glow worms. Their larva gives off light.

821
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:34,284
Just calm down.

822
01:03:34,653 --> 01:03:36,619
Okay, is there, like, a new Black Panther...

823
01:03:36,842 --> 01:03:39,211
- that you can call to come and get us? - No.

824
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:40,380
Why not?

825
01:03:40,545 --> 01:03:42,195
Because it doesn't work like that anymore.

826
01:03:42,897 --> 01:03:44,547
The Black Panther is gone.

827
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:47,270
So y'all stopped having Black Panthers when I get kidnapped?

828
01:03:52,717 --> 01:03:53,748
Princess.

829
01:03:54,945 --> 01:03:57,007
Here royalty wears traditional clothing.

830
01:03:57,379 --> 01:03:59,565
We had this made for you.

831
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,454
Do you understand her?

832
01:04:02,536 --> 01:04:04,062
Not completely.

833
01:04:06,126 --> 01:04:07,393
Nuh-uh.

834
01:04:07,562 --> 01:04:09,842
That is some supervillain shit right there.

835
01:04:10,053 --> 01:04:11,447
That's in every movie.

836
01:04:11,616 --> 01:04:12,882
Princess Leia.

837
01:04:12,967 --> 01:04:14,277
Belle from Beauty and the Beast.

838
01:04:14,445 --> 01:04:17,063
That white chick from Indiana Jones.

839
01:04:17,189 --> 01:04:18,203
It's fine.

840
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:20,914
You should see what I have to wear at Warrior Falls.

841
01:04:27,289 --> 01:04:28,289
Come with me.

842
01:04:29,289 --> 01:04:30,634
Wait.

843
01:04:30,716 --> 01:04:33,121
You're not leaving me in here, are you?

844
01:04:33,366 --> 01:04:34,774
I'm coming back.

845
01:04:35,415 --> 01:04:36,695
I'm coming back.

846
01:04:36,866 --> 01:04:38,829
Stay calm.

847
01:04:45,999 --> 01:04:46,998
Eat?

848
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,229
Hello Ma'am. It's nice to meet you.

849
01:05:03,312 --> 01:05:04,353
What can I help you with?

850
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:08,390
My name is Maria Aldana. I'm a student from Merida...

851
01:05:08,764 --> 01:05:10,470
I'm not interested. Go away. Please.

852
01:05:10,678 --> 01:05:14,632
Yes, of course. I don't mean to bother you. Just give me a second...

853
01:05:15,131 --> 01:05:17,088
My professor mentioned a study

854
01:05:17,296 --> 01:05:21,915
where you told researchers that you encountered something...

855
01:05:22,706 --> 01:05:24,995
Someone unimaginable.

856
01:05:25,786 --> 01:05:28,324
Nothing good came of speaking with those outsiders.

857
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:29,947
I'm begging you.

858
01:05:30,155 --> 01:05:31,321
Leave. Now.

859
01:05:32,902 --> 01:05:35,067
I've encountered him too.

860
01:05:46,595 --> 01:05:50,506
Sometimes we would catch a glimpse of a man with winged feet...

861
01:05:51,755 --> 01:05:53,378
...on the shore of the beach.

862
01:05:54,169 --> 01:05:56,042
We thought he was a spirit.

863
01:05:56,915 --> 01:05:58,372
The K'uk'ulkan.

864
01:05:58,954 --> 01:06:01,452
Our Feathered Serpent God,

865
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,114
...of this realm and the realm below.

866
01:06:05,946 --> 01:06:08,693
I would very much like to visit that beach.

867
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:10,358
Be warned...

868
01:06:11,107 --> 01:06:16,933
K'uk'ulkan has been here for much longer than you and I.

869
01:06:17,225 --> 01:06:19,306
Others who have searched for him

870
01:06:19,555 --> 01:06:21,220
with ill in their hearts...

871
01:06:21,595 --> 01:06:22,595
have never returned.

872
01:06:23,887 --> 01:06:25,344
Lost to the depths...

873
01:06:26,761 --> 01:06:28,678
forever...

874
01:06:47,721 --> 01:06:49,431
Princess.

875
01:06:49,556 --> 01:06:50,558
Welcome.

876
01:06:52,518 --> 01:06:54,979
Please, feel free.

877
01:07:02,238 --> 01:07:03,573
This is beautiful.

878
01:07:04,365 --> 01:07:06,075
That was my mother's.

879
01:07:16,213 --> 01:07:18,716
These are all Mesoamerican artifacts.

880
01:07:20,218 --> 01:07:22,053
Most likely 16th century.

881
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:25,515
Have you been alive since then?

882
01:07:27,351 --> 01:07:29,062
Your mother was human.

883
01:07:30,396 --> 01:07:31,396
She was.

884
01:07:31,605 --> 01:07:33,814
Then she became something else.

885
01:07:34,065 --> 01:07:36,106
- How? - "How?"

886
01:07:36,607 --> 01:07:39,108
"How" is never as important as "why."

887
01:07:50,321 --> 01:07:53,405
My mother and her village were driven from their farms...

888
01:07:53,655 --> 01:07:57,323
by Spanish conquistadors who brought the smallpox...

889
01:07:57,532 --> 01:08:00,407
a hateful language, and dogma from another world.

890
01:08:02,242 --> 01:08:03,951
Facing starvation...

891
01:08:04,117 --> 01:08:05,868
war, and disease...

892
01:08:06,451 --> 01:08:08,202
my people turned to Chaac...

893
01:08:09,827 --> 01:08:11,787
our god of rain and abundance.

894
01:08:13,871 --> 01:08:16,872
Chaac gave our shaman a vision...

895
01:08:17,331 --> 01:08:20,040
a way to save his people.

896
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:27,918
Chaac led him to a plant sprouting from a blue rock.

897
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:43,590
My mother was pregnant with me at the time...

898
01:08:43,757 --> 01:08:46,008
and she did not want to ingest the plant...

899
01:08:46,133 --> 01:08:48,342
for fear of what it may do to me.

900
01:08:48,884 --> 01:08:50,051
No. My baby.

901
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:52,388
But the Shaman was convincing.

902
01:09:00,986 --> 01:09:02,864
Your baby is sick.

903
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:05,160
Only this can heal him.

904
01:09:05,785 --> 01:09:09,332
Your baby will be the first to be born in our new home.

905
01:09:11,003 --> 01:09:12,254
Take this gift as a promise...

906
01:09:12,337 --> 01:09:15,886
He will be our new king.

907
01:09:24,316 --> 01:09:26,111
They all fell sick.

908
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:29,115
And their lives...

909
01:09:29,241 --> 01:09:31,369
their existence there...

910
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:32,955
ended.

911
01:09:44,767 --> 01:09:46,978
The plant took away their ability to breathe air...

912
01:09:47,229 --> 01:09:50,985
but enabled them to draw oxygen from the sea.

913
01:09:54,324 --> 01:09:56,077
They settled in the ocean...

914
01:09:56,787 --> 01:09:59,917
away from war and diseases.

915
01:10:02,505 --> 01:10:03,548
Let's go!

916
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:31,261
My mother gave birth to me there...

917
01:10:31,511 --> 01:10:34,766
and I became the firstborn son of Talokan.

918
01:10:35,267 --> 01:10:37,354
The plant gave me wings on my ankles...

919
01:10:37,521 --> 01:10:39,900
and ears that pointed to the clouds.

920
01:10:40,401 --> 01:10:41,652
I was a mutant.

921
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:45,826
I could swim in the sky and age slower.

922
01:10:45,993 --> 01:10:48,456
Breathe the air our ancestors breathed.

923
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:51,336
As she grew older...

924
01:10:52,588 --> 01:10:56,260
my mother mourned the life on land that she once knew...

925
01:10:58,180 --> 01:10:59,849
and died with a broken heart.

926
01:11:02,729 --> 01:11:06,694
She made me promise to bury her in the soil of her homeland.

927
01:11:11,786 --> 01:11:15,167
Nothing could prepare me for what I found there.

928
01:11:21,928 --> 01:11:22,917
Whose child is this?

929
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:39,241
Shoot!

930
01:11:39,731 --> 01:11:40,635
Fire!

931
01:11:55,451 --> 01:11:56,696
Thou art a demon.

932
01:11:57,375 --> 01:11:58,542
Son of Satan.

933
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,503
A Spanish man of faith cursed me.

934
01:12:00,692 --> 01:12:02,350
As he died by my hand...

935
01:12:02,501 --> 01:12:03,444
he called me...

936
01:12:03,594 --> 01:12:04,650
Thou art a child without love.

937
01:12:05,442 --> 01:12:06,422
The child without love.

938
01:12:08,307 --> 01:12:11,248
The child without love.

939
01:12:12,096 --> 01:12:13,963
And I took my name from there.

940
01:12:21,259 --> 01:12:23,047
"Namor."

941
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:26,081
Because I have no love for the surface world.

942
01:12:28,076 --> 01:12:30,155
Why are you telling me all of this?

943
01:12:31,485 --> 01:12:34,603
So that you can understand why I have to kill the scientist.

944
01:12:34,686 --> 01:12:36,432
What if we took her to Wakanda?

945
01:12:37,721 --> 01:12:38,885
Let us go.

946
01:12:39,799 --> 01:12:41,378
I give you my word.

947
01:12:41,545 --> 01:12:42,916
She will remain in my country.

948
01:12:43,165 --> 01:12:44,662
I cannot risk that, Princess.

949
01:12:44,871 --> 01:12:46,408
Then keep me instead.

950
01:12:48,362 --> 01:12:50,024
I'd love to see your nation.

951
01:12:51,313 --> 01:12:53,974
Well, you can't go down there in that.

952
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:59,460
Hypothermia will grip you almost instantaneously.

953
01:12:59,544 --> 01:13:01,789
Your blood will become toxic...

954
01:13:01,996 --> 01:13:05,779
and the pressure of the ocean will break every bone in your body.

955
01:13:08,855 --> 01:13:10,102
Or you can wear a suit.

956
01:13:10,643 --> 01:13:12,263
We have some of them. Come on.

957
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:16,338
Stay close.

958
01:14:20,532 --> 01:14:22,238
Hey! Namor, wait!

959
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:26,885
Hello.

960
01:16:55,365 --> 01:16:56,488
It's beautiful.

961
01:16:58,358 --> 01:16:59,565
It's made of vibranium.

962
01:16:59,773 --> 01:17:00,754
Yes.

963
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:02,429
In the depths of the ocean...

964
01:17:02,796 --> 01:17:05,002
I brought the sun to my people.

965
01:17:07,004 --> 01:17:10,477
I know you wished me to spare the life of the scientist.

966
01:17:10,886 --> 01:17:13,010
But now you see what I have to protect.

967
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:39,405
Nakia, your hunch was correct.

968
01:17:39,486 --> 01:17:42,510
I have picked up a location on Shuri's Kimoyo earrings.

969
01:18:15,196 --> 01:18:17,770
The signal is coming from an underwater cavern...

970
01:18:17,974 --> 01:18:21,324
approximately 140 meters below the surface.

971
01:18:21,937 --> 01:18:24,184
Queen Mother, I've found her signal.

972
01:18:24,348 --> 01:18:27,290
It's coming from an underwater cave.

973
01:18:27,493 --> 01:18:30,068
If she's down there, I'm sure I'll encounter resistance.

974
01:18:30,967 --> 01:18:33,582
How would you like me to proceed?

975
01:18:33,745 --> 01:18:38,035
Retrieve the princess by any means necessary.

976
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,426
I will attempt to draw Namor out.

977
01:19:15,502 --> 01:19:18,730
You are the first person from the surface to come to Talokan.

978
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:21,712
Please take this as a token of our gratitude.

979
01:19:28,699 --> 01:19:31,314
It was made with the plant that saved Talokan.

980
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:35,399
You are young, Princess.

981
01:19:36,216 --> 01:19:39,036
When you age as I do, you realize...

982
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,978
we all lose everyone we love.

983
01:19:42,059 --> 01:19:43,694
But when I lost my brother...

984
01:19:43,856 --> 01:19:45,409
it just felt different.

985
01:19:45,573 --> 01:19:47,166
He suffered in silence.

986
01:19:47,779 --> 01:19:50,762
When he finally asked me to help him, I couldn't.

987
01:19:51,783 --> 01:19:54,317
How does that make sense...

988
01:19:54,398 --> 01:19:57,993
that the ancestors would give me gifts and skills...

989
01:19:58,198 --> 01:20:00,853
to help me save my brother, and I couldn't?

990
01:20:02,365 --> 01:20:03,652
Why?

991
01:20:06,763 --> 01:20:10,036
I don't have an answer for that question.

992
01:20:12,772 --> 01:20:15,937
My ancestors would often say...

993
01:20:16,526 --> 01:20:20,924
"Only the most broken people can be great leaders."

994
01:20:25,698 --> 01:20:28,487
I admire what you have built here.

995
01:20:31,491 --> 01:20:34,709
And how you've protected your people.

996
01:20:35,675 --> 01:20:39,537
But as princess of Wakanda...

997
01:20:39,806 --> 01:20:42,916
I will not stand for you killing that young woman.

998
01:20:45,062 --> 01:20:49,138
My nation will not rest until I'm returned.

999
01:20:50,908 --> 01:20:53,643
I'm not leaving without her.

1000
01:20:54,663 --> 01:20:59,383
We need to find a peaceful way to resolve this.

1001
01:21:04,157 --> 01:21:06,356
It is no longer about the scientist.

1002
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:14,831
For centuries, the surface nations have conquered and enslaved people like us.

1003
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:17,566
Over resources.

1004
01:21:19,337 --> 01:21:22,340
Since the day I buried my mother...

1005
01:21:22,448 --> 01:21:27,383
I have prepared my people for the time they will come for us.

1006
01:21:27,489 --> 01:21:33,014
And that machine is the sign that the time is now.

1007
01:21:35,428 --> 01:21:42,294
I need to know if Wakanda is an ally or an enemy.

1008
01:21:42,937 --> 01:21:45,244
There is no in-between.

1009
01:21:48,034 --> 01:21:52,754
So you plan to wage war on the entire world...

1010
01:21:53,559 --> 01:21:56,455
and you want Wakanda to help you?

1011
01:21:57,742 --> 01:21:59,136
That's madness.

1012
01:21:59,405 --> 01:22:05,412
There isn't a nation that wouldn't plunder Wakanda if given a chance.

1013
01:22:07,129 --> 01:22:09,597
If we make an alliance...

1014
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:13,297
we can protect each other by striking them first.

1015
01:22:13,834 --> 01:22:19,412
Then, when the threat of these nations has been eliminated...

1016
01:22:19,627 --> 01:22:23,059
the scientist will be returned to Wakanda.

1017
01:22:23,543 --> 01:22:27,244
And if Wakanda does not accept, what then?

1018
01:22:28,638 --> 01:22:31,159
The scientist will die.

1019
01:22:32,393 --> 01:22:36,093
And Wakanda will be the first nation to fall.

1020
01:22:36,523 --> 01:22:38,346
An attack on my people?

1021
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:40,265
Yes.

1022
01:22:40,429 --> 01:22:42,767
And I want you to listen to me.

1023
01:22:42,972 --> 01:22:46,745
Wakanda cannot win a war with Talokan.

1024
01:22:49,862 --> 01:22:51,995
You have been summoned...

1025
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:53,348
K'uk'ulkan.

1026
01:22:57,532 --> 01:23:01,756
I heard you that night, with your mother at the river.

1027
01:23:02,986 --> 01:23:05,734
You said you wanted to burn the world.

1028
01:23:11,804 --> 01:23:14,164
Let us burn it together.

1029
01:23:21,862 --> 01:23:24,791
Queen Ramonda won't sell us any vibranium.

1030
01:23:25,483 --> 01:23:28,250
And now they abducted a young woman who built the machine.

1031
01:23:28,412 --> 01:23:31,302
Yeah, with all due respect, Riri Williams is a child prodigy...

1032
01:23:31,464 --> 01:23:33,579
who was running circles around all of her professors.

1033
01:23:33,661 --> 01:23:36,550
The Wakandans were recruiting her as part of their outreach program.

1034
01:23:36,631 --> 01:23:38,096
Nothing more. And then...

1035
01:23:38,259 --> 01:23:40,578
you guys send in a SWAT team under cover of night...

1036
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:44,036
to arrest the Crown Princess of an international superpower.

1037
01:23:47,087 --> 01:23:49,894
The President wants to take offensive action against Wakanda.

1038
01:23:51,238 --> 01:23:53,069
What type of offensive action?

1039
01:23:53,841 --> 01:23:55,224
Destabilization.

1040
01:23:56,364 --> 01:23:59,659
Well, Special Officer Ross is our expert.

1041
01:23:59,904 --> 01:24:02,019
So, Ross, what do you think?

1042
01:24:02,101 --> 01:24:04,867
My sources are telling me that there's someone else out there.

1043
01:24:05,802 --> 01:24:07,553
- Another nation? - Could be. I don't know.

1044
01:24:07,755 --> 01:24:09,830
You've gotta give me enough time to investigate this properly...

1045
01:24:09,993 --> 01:24:12,028
otherwise we're gonna find ourselves at war...

1046
01:24:12,191 --> 01:24:13,899
with a country whose military capacity...

1047
01:24:14,062 --> 01:24:15,974
we can't even comprehend.

1048
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:18,419
Director?

1049
01:24:18,949 --> 01:24:21,154
I think he's the expert.

1050
01:24:21,317 --> 01:24:24,175
I think it would be a mistake to attack Wakanda.

1051
01:24:30,626 --> 01:24:31,605
Yes?

1052
01:24:31,687 --> 01:24:32,666
We have a problem.

1053
01:24:53,977 --> 01:24:56,222
Is my daughter alive?

1054
01:24:56,386 --> 01:24:58,304
The princess is alive and well.

1055
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:01,815
She requested to be taken to Talokan.

1056
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:04,224
She will remain there for the time being.

1057
01:25:07,858 --> 01:25:11,042
What can I offer you in exchange?

1058
01:25:11,409 --> 01:25:12,471
Nothing.

1059
01:25:12,797 --> 01:25:14,512
I beg to differ.

1060
01:25:14,675 --> 01:25:17,941
The Americans are preparing to blame Wakanda...

1061
01:25:18,186 --> 01:25:20,798
for your attack on their mining ship.

1062
01:25:20,962 --> 01:25:23,901
Return my daughter and the scientist...

1063
01:25:24,024 --> 01:25:27,657
or I will inform them of your existence.

1064
01:25:34,148 --> 01:25:36,230
If you tell the Americans about us...

1065
01:25:37,741 --> 01:25:39,864
if you try to find us...

1066
01:25:40,926 --> 01:25:44,640
or if I discover a single Wakandan ship in the ocean...

1067
01:25:45,416 --> 01:25:46,845
I will kill the princess.

1068
01:25:48,315 --> 01:25:50,111
I will come to Wakanda...

1069
01:25:50,233 --> 01:25:52,234
and I will kill you.

1070
01:26:01,378 --> 01:26:02,409
So, what happened?

1071
01:26:04,263 --> 01:26:07,189
He wants to go to war with the surface world...

1072
01:26:07,395 --> 01:26:09,043
and asked me to help him.

1073
01:26:13,577 --> 01:26:15,678
I need to think.

1074
01:26:15,885 --> 01:26:17,780
We ain't never gettin' out of here.

1075
01:26:29,937 --> 01:26:31,215
Drop your spear!

1076
01:26:31,338 --> 01:26:32,781
Kill the Princess!

1077
01:26:38,756 --> 01:26:40,157
Drop your knife.

1078
01:26:40,611 --> 01:26:41,559
You...

1079
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:43,417
You killed her.

1080
01:26:44,207 --> 01:26:45,472
Let her go

1081
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:47,527
and you don't have to die.

1082
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:51,354
Shuri...

1083
01:26:52,336 --> 01:26:53,768
Move your left arm.

1084
01:26:58,390 --> 01:26:59,495
Are you okay?

1085
01:27:00,271 --> 01:27:01,622
Are you okay?

1086
01:27:01,826 --> 01:27:03,053
- Give me your Beads! - Let's go.

1087
01:27:03,177 --> 01:27:05,672
- Give me your Beads. I can save her. - We have to go.

1088
01:27:05,753 --> 01:27:08,086
Shuri, I don't know who this lady is, but we need to listen to her.

1089
01:27:08,208 --> 01:27:09,394
Listen, I hit her with a sonic round.

1090
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:11,563
It is lethal from this distance. There is no chance.

1091
01:27:11,727 --> 01:27:13,690
You don't understand. This will mean war.

1092
01:27:13,853 --> 01:27:16,103
- We have to go. - Wait!

1093
01:27:58,976 --> 01:27:59,958
Did they hurt you?

1094
01:28:00,039 --> 01:28:01,594
No. No.

1095
01:28:03,067 --> 01:28:04,253
Thank you.

1096
01:28:05,071 --> 01:28:06,175
You're welcome.

1097
01:28:07,689 --> 01:28:08,875
- GRIOT. - Yes, my Queen.

1098
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:11,003
Return us to Wakanda at once.

1099
01:28:14,685 --> 01:28:16,526
What happened my child?

1100
01:28:18,449 --> 01:28:20,290
The Wakandans.

1101
01:28:21,067 --> 01:28:22,744
They came for her.

1102
01:28:25,403 --> 01:28:27,408
K'uk'ulkan...

1103
01:28:29,822 --> 01:28:33,258
can you save me?

1104
01:28:46,227 --> 01:28:47,700
Is she dead?

1105
01:28:50,072 --> 01:28:51,137
Yes.

1106
01:28:59,523 --> 01:29:01,896
Rest child.

1107
01:29:04,433 --> 01:29:05,742
They came...

1108
01:29:06,232 --> 01:29:10,120
while you spoke to the Queen?

1109
01:29:11,511 --> 01:29:14,783
We should not have trusted her.

1110
01:29:15,561 --> 01:29:18,506
The Princess has seen our home.

1111
01:29:18,874 --> 01:29:21,043
What is stopping them

1112
01:29:21,533 --> 01:29:23,620
from coming for Talokan?

1113
01:29:25,870 --> 01:29:27,015
I will.

1114
01:30:01,299 --> 01:30:02,772
Rise Talokan!

1115
01:30:05,104 --> 01:30:06,822
Rise Talokan!

1116
01:30:11,936 --> 01:30:14,022
I was blinded

1117
01:30:14,105 --> 01:30:15,413
by hope

1118
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:17,254
of partnership.

1119
01:30:19,137 --> 01:30:20,159
And...

1120
01:30:20,814 --> 01:30:23,064
I have compromised

1121
01:30:23,555 --> 01:30:25,641
all of us.

1122
01:30:26,378 --> 01:30:27,482
Talokan

1123
01:30:27,974 --> 01:30:29,364
will not move

1124
01:30:29,528 --> 01:30:30,959
again.

1125
01:30:31,901 --> 01:30:32,902
Namora.

1126
01:30:33,946 --> 01:30:34,932
Attuma.

1127
01:30:37,028 --> 01:30:39,987
When we are done with them

1128
01:30:42,823 --> 01:30:45,165
they will never think

1129
01:30:45,371 --> 01:30:47,343
of approaching

1130
01:30:47,548 --> 01:30:48,945
Talokan!

1131
01:30:51,247 --> 01:30:52,644
Rise Talokan!

1132
01:31:04,768 --> 01:31:07,192
Princess, it is good to have you back.

1133
01:31:07,726 --> 01:31:09,494
The city has been on edge since you left.

1134
01:31:10,439 --> 01:31:11,384
Go.

1135
01:31:11,548 --> 01:31:14,055
Fortify the sonic barriers for all waterways.

1136
01:31:14,261 --> 01:31:15,066
Princess?

1137
01:31:15,771 --> 01:31:16,748
Neka.

1138
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:21,020
Thank the ancestors.

1139
01:31:21,386 --> 01:31:24,478
I just wanted to return these.

1140
01:31:25,577 --> 01:31:27,693
No. Keep them.

1141
01:31:27,897 --> 01:31:29,402
Might need them soon.

1142
01:31:30,338 --> 01:31:32,251
Did you get that from down there?

1143
01:31:35,059 --> 01:31:38,477
Is it true you saw an underwater empire?

1144
01:31:39,697 --> 01:31:40,766
Yes.

1145
01:31:41,957 --> 01:31:43,642
It is beautiful.

1146
01:31:44,834 --> 01:31:47,382
But these people are dangerous, Aneka.

1147
01:32:07,353 --> 01:32:10,065
So, Miss Riri Williams...

1148
01:32:10,722 --> 01:32:12,859
what do you think of Wakanda?

1149
01:32:13,064 --> 01:32:15,900
The stories just don't do this place justice.

1150
01:32:18,078 --> 01:32:19,098
It's great.

1151
01:32:19,383 --> 01:32:20,973
But I really would like to go home.

1152
01:32:22,523 --> 01:32:23,910
You will need to be patient.

1153
01:32:24,114 --> 01:32:26,112
Can I at least call my mom?

1154
01:32:32,434 --> 01:32:35,697
The Princess has been brought home by the War Dog Nakia.

1155
01:32:35,861 --> 01:32:37,125
Glory to Hanuman.

1156
01:32:37,329 --> 01:32:38,715
Glory to Hanuman.

1157
01:32:39,857 --> 01:32:43,243
The spy saves Wakanda once again.

1158
01:32:43,814 --> 01:32:45,242
The Queen will reward her...

1159
01:32:45,323 --> 01:32:47,851
with lifetime banishment. I'm sure of it.

1160
01:32:50,258 --> 01:32:51,604
Okoye.

1161
01:32:54,091 --> 01:32:55,070
Thank you, my sister.

1162
01:32:57,232 --> 01:32:58,415
After Thanos' attack...

1163
01:32:58,782 --> 01:33:00,862
when you left without saying a word...

1164
01:33:01,555 --> 01:33:02,616
it hurt.

1165
01:33:06,572 --> 01:33:09,794
I regret not being there with all of you.

1166
01:33:11,385 --> 01:33:12,690
It was not easy.

1167
01:33:13,424 --> 01:33:14,408
He was...

1168
01:33:15,023 --> 01:33:18,793
King and Black Panther to everyone.

1169
01:33:19,489 --> 01:33:20,924
But to me...

1170
01:33:27,194 --> 01:33:28,957
he was everything.

1171
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,686
My T'Challa.

1172
01:33:34,038 --> 01:33:36,948
When he was taken away from me, just like that, I...

1173
01:33:37,603 --> 01:33:39,448
I had to step away...

1174
01:33:40,431 --> 01:33:42,070
and let myself break.

1175
01:33:44,571 --> 01:33:46,620
I couldn't just...

1176
01:33:46,701 --> 01:33:50,062
keep going as if nothing had happened, you know.

1177
01:34:07,643 --> 01:34:08,582
We are under attack.

1178
01:34:16,129 --> 01:34:17,112
Here.

1179
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:24,921
Take this one.

1180
01:34:25,932 --> 01:34:27,689
Are you okay? Are you all right?

1181
01:34:27,777 --> 01:34:29,842
GRIOT, activate the Sunbird.

1182
01:34:30,018 --> 01:34:31,159
Shuri, where are you?

1183
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:32,772
Making my way to the city right now.

1184
01:34:32,928 --> 01:34:34,213
Stand down! That is an order!

1185
01:34:34,408 --> 01:34:36,590
Mother, I'm with Aneka. We can provide air support.

1186
01:34:36,784 --> 01:34:39,122
- Aneka, do not let her leave the lab. - Mother, you're breaking up.

1187
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:40,105
- We can't hear you. - Shuri!

1188
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:41,163
Love you. Bye!

1189
01:34:43,457 --> 01:34:44,522
You just hung up on the Queen.

1190
01:34:44,645 --> 01:34:45,628
I just hung up on my mom.

1191
01:34:45,792 --> 01:34:47,347
There's a difference. Come. Let's go!

1192
01:35:19,211 --> 01:35:21,053
Invaders!

1193
01:35:26,583 --> 01:35:29,737
Mama! Mama!

1194
01:35:32,603 --> 01:35:34,118
Let us turn! Turn around!

1195
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:40,876
EMTs are suffering a form of sonic hypnosis.

1196
01:35:43,415 --> 01:35:44,521
Take the child.

1197
01:35:44,726 --> 01:35:46,487
General, plug your ears.

1198
01:35:46,651 --> 01:35:47,716
Yes, my Queen.

1199
01:36:33,176 --> 01:36:34,159
Can I help?

1200
01:36:34,282 --> 01:36:35,470
Come, quickly.

1201
01:36:42,227 --> 01:36:43,702
Warrior!

1202
01:36:45,668 --> 01:36:46,650
Cross your arms...

1203
01:36:46,732 --> 01:36:47,761
...my child.

1204
01:36:52,649 --> 01:36:53,630
Nakia.

1205
01:36:53,753 --> 01:36:54,694
Yes.

1206
01:36:55,184 --> 01:36:56,166
We'll find your mama, OK?

1207
01:37:07,902 --> 01:37:09,211
The fish man.

1208
01:37:13,423 --> 01:37:16,000
The defenses have been lured away from the palace.

1209
01:37:16,367 --> 01:37:18,371
It is up to you now.

1210
01:38:35,455 --> 01:38:36,430
Mayday!

1211
01:38:36,917 --> 01:38:37,942
Mayday!

1212
01:38:55,445 --> 01:38:57,330
- Shit, he's too fast. - He's even faster in the water.

1213
01:39:22,949 --> 01:39:24,424
- Activating system override. - No.

1214
01:39:24,589 --> 01:39:26,556
- Wait! I'll fix it. - Can't leave you here, Shuri!

1215
01:39:43,567 --> 01:39:44,551
Do you see her?

1216
01:39:44,797 --> 01:39:46,108
Yes. Right there.

1217
01:39:59,430 --> 01:40:00,346
Go, child.

1218
01:40:01,645 --> 01:40:03,019
Wait, what? And leave you here?

1219
01:40:03,172 --> 01:40:04,231
Run!

1220
01:40:19,139 --> 01:40:20,536
Okoye, move now!

1221
01:41:22,201 --> 01:41:23,155
Help the child.

1222
01:41:29,171 --> 01:41:30,207
She did this.

1223
01:41:34,274 --> 01:41:38,257
In one week's time, I will return with my entire army...

1224
01:41:38,339 --> 01:41:41,575
and you will join us against the surface world...

1225
01:41:41,741 --> 01:41:44,688
or I will wash Wakanda from the face of the Earth.

1226
01:41:45,558 --> 01:41:46,530
Come on, my Queen.

1227
01:41:47,585 --> 01:41:48,557
Mother.

1228
01:41:48,962 --> 01:41:50,624
- Keep her back! - Mother!

1229
01:41:50,948 --> 01:41:53,771
- Mama! Mama! - Bury your dead.

1230
01:41:54,584 --> 01:41:56,124
Mourn your losses.

1231
01:41:59,504 --> 01:42:01,216
You are queen now.

1232
01:42:01,429 --> 01:42:02,414
Mother!

1233
01:42:03,226 --> 01:42:04,243
No!

1234
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:09,029
Get off of me! Mother!

1235
01:42:09,707 --> 01:42:11,699
Mama!

1236
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,170
Mama!

1237
01:42:20,722 --> 01:42:22,246
Mama!

1238
01:42:22,797 --> 01:42:23,940
Mother!

1239
01:42:24,576 --> 01:42:25,624
Wake up, my Queen.

1240
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:28,730
Let me see.

1241
01:42:29,415 --> 01:42:30,385
Wake up.

1242
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:32,832
Help me!

1243
01:42:32,917 --> 01:42:34,182
Mama!

1244
01:42:37,810 --> 01:42:38,991
Wake up, Mother.

1245
01:42:39,666 --> 01:42:40,890
She has passed.

1246
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:43,294
Mama!

1247
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:30,415
Jabariland offers you their comfort for your loss.

1248
01:43:37,122 --> 01:43:38,810
You must mourn her...

1249
01:43:38,978 --> 01:43:42,944
in accordance to the rituals of your ancestors.

1250
01:43:44,843 --> 01:43:46,740
Do not bury yourself in your technology.

1251
01:43:46,868 --> 01:43:48,175
Why are you here?

1252
01:43:50,031 --> 01:43:51,845
I promised your brother...

1253
01:43:51,930 --> 01:43:54,250
that I would provide you with counsel...

1254
01:43:54,418 --> 01:43:55,980
and protection.

1255
01:43:58,384 --> 01:44:00,578
But I am in need of your advice today.

1256
01:44:04,585 --> 01:44:08,170
Your tribal elders have approached me with a proposition.

1257
01:44:09,647 --> 01:44:12,937
They wish to evacuate the city and set up camp...

1258
01:44:13,022 --> 01:44:14,625
in Jabariland.

1259
01:44:14,794 --> 01:44:18,000
So, now you are keen to hear from a child...

1260
01:44:18,633 --> 01:44:20,362
who scoffs at tradition?

1261
01:44:24,581 --> 01:44:25,677
The world...

1262
01:44:27,576 --> 01:44:30,191
The world has taken too much from you...

1263
01:44:30,993 --> 01:44:34,284
for you to still be considered a child.

1264
01:44:37,447 --> 01:44:39,346
It is in my people's interest to know...

1265
01:44:39,515 --> 01:44:41,961
which way your mind is leaning.

1266
01:44:43,817 --> 01:44:45,673
The elders are desperate.

1267
01:44:47,193 --> 01:44:49,133
The city is vulnerable.

1268
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:53,647
If you are to provide for them...

1269
01:44:54,785 --> 01:44:57,063
they will be in great debt to you.

1270
01:44:59,173 --> 01:45:00,860
And what of your heart?

1271
01:45:04,446 --> 01:45:06,471
Which way is your heart leaning?

1272
01:45:08,412 --> 01:45:11,322
I just buried the last person who truly knew me.

1273
01:45:14,950 --> 01:45:16,511
My heart was buried with her.

1274
01:45:54,098 --> 01:45:55,068
Oh, man.

1275
01:45:55,953 --> 01:45:57,809
Yeah, your olive oil's about to go bad.

1276
01:45:58,062 --> 01:45:59,075
What are you doing here?

1277
01:45:59,285 --> 01:46:01,857
I'm hungry. And...

1278
01:46:02,406 --> 01:46:04,430
Tragedy strikes the international community.

1279
01:46:04,598 --> 01:46:08,774
Sources can now confirm that Queen Ramonda, daughter of Lumumba, has died.

1280
01:46:09,279 --> 01:46:13,159
Western allies say that civil conflict was the likely cause of the Queen's...

1281
01:46:15,605 --> 01:46:16,617
So...

1282
01:46:17,081 --> 01:46:18,473
You have any comment?

1283
01:46:20,539 --> 01:46:23,744
I wonder what else your friends are keeping from you.

1284
01:46:24,503 --> 01:46:25,684
What are you talking about?

1285
01:46:25,852 --> 01:46:29,395
I have no unsanctioned contact with the kingdom of Wakanda.

1286
01:46:31,841 --> 01:46:34,034
What about the Beads?

1287
01:46:35,256 --> 01:46:36,351
What?

1288
01:46:36,477 --> 01:46:37,487
The Beads.

1289
01:46:37,613 --> 01:46:38,749
I had them bugged...

1290
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:40,643
before you ever even got there.

1291
01:46:40,769 --> 01:46:44,768
I've been privy to every conversation you've had...

1292
01:46:44,852 --> 01:46:47,461
including that treasonous call with the Queen.

1293
01:46:47,714 --> 01:46:48,976
May she rest in peace.

1294
01:46:49,397 --> 01:46:50,828
But it's good.

1295
01:46:50,996 --> 01:46:52,048
Well, for us.

1296
01:46:52,217 --> 01:46:54,910
All right. You know what? The Wakandans saved my life.

1297
01:46:55,373 --> 01:46:56,426
They're a good people.

1298
01:46:57,141 --> 01:46:59,203
You ever thought for a second...

1299
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:00,970
what they could be doing?

1300
01:47:01,181 --> 01:47:02,527
Ever thought what we would be doing...

1301
01:47:02,738 --> 01:47:05,852
if the US was the only country in the world with vibranium?

1302
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:10,481
I actually dream about that.

1303
01:47:13,302 --> 01:47:15,069
Val. Val, please.

1304
01:47:15,364 --> 01:47:17,047
It's Director de Fontaine.

1305
01:47:19,951 --> 01:47:23,150
Your mother protected me like I was one of her own.

1306
01:47:24,538 --> 01:47:26,937
The least that I could do is try to return the favor.

1307
01:47:29,251 --> 01:47:31,777
We need to find a way to weaken Namor.

1308
01:47:31,946 --> 01:47:34,133
Even weakened, he's still gonna be a problem.

1309
01:47:34,302 --> 01:47:37,626
The Black Panther has never failed to protect Wakanda.

1310
01:47:38,510 --> 01:47:40,530
I thought the Black Panther was gone.

1311
01:47:50,252 --> 01:47:51,641
My brother is dead.

1312
01:47:53,366 --> 01:47:56,018
But it doesn't mean the Black Panther is gone.

1313
01:48:13,988 --> 01:48:15,419
GRIOT?

1314
01:48:15,587 --> 01:48:18,322
Let's start by running a comparative analysis...

1315
01:48:18,449 --> 01:48:22,068
between our attempts at creating a synthetic Heart-Shaped Herb...

1316
01:48:24,762 --> 01:48:26,865
and the fibers from this bracelet.

1317
01:48:27,412 --> 01:48:28,675
Yes, Princess.

1318
01:48:32,041 --> 01:48:34,819
Since this was grown from vibranium-rich soil...

1319
01:48:36,081 --> 01:48:39,490
they may share some base-level similarities that we can exploit.

1320
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:41,005
As you wish, Princess.

1321
01:48:45,382 --> 01:48:47,822
Please upload my brother's DNA also.

1322
01:48:47,906 --> 01:48:49,042
Uploading now.

1323
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:22,329
Why doesn't he look like them?

1324
01:49:22,539 --> 01:49:24,728
His physiology is completely different.

1325
01:49:24,811 --> 01:49:27,589
None of them fly or have pointed ears like him.

1326
01:49:28,010 --> 01:49:30,030
The women that were guarding us, they had water over their mouths...

1327
01:49:30,198 --> 01:49:32,008
and on their necks.

1328
01:49:32,092 --> 01:49:33,104
He didn't have that.

1329
01:49:33,188 --> 01:49:38,669
Several organisms don't need gills to extract oxygen from the water, so...

1330
01:49:38,837 --> 01:49:40,482
It's like a jellyfish.

1331
01:49:40,565 --> 01:49:44,486
He just absorbs the oxygen from his skin.

1332
01:49:45,836 --> 01:49:48,070
- It's a process called diffusion. - Diffusion.

1333
01:50:12,733 --> 01:50:15,473
Every day that passes without selecting the ruler...

1334
01:50:15,642 --> 01:50:17,159
is a day wasted.

1335
01:50:17,285 --> 01:50:20,658
We must deal with Namor before he brings his warriors back here.

1336
01:50:20,785 --> 01:50:23,610
And how are we to deal with a man with that much power?

1337
01:50:24,537 --> 01:50:26,139
In that attack, before he took out your plane...

1338
01:50:26,391 --> 01:50:27,698
he jumped back into the water.

1339
01:50:27,826 --> 01:50:29,596
What if that's what makes him strong?

1340
01:50:29,807 --> 01:50:33,264
He's breathing air and getting oxygen from the water on his skin.

1341
01:50:33,474 --> 01:50:36,763
If we could find a way to dry his ass out, he won't be as strong.

1342
01:50:37,142 --> 01:50:38,323
Yo, that's it.

1343
01:50:38,449 --> 01:50:39,457
GRIOT.

1344
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:43,362
We need to convert the Royal Talon Fighter into a pervaporation chamber.

1345
01:50:43,531 --> 01:50:44,622
Is that even possible?

1346
01:50:44,790 --> 01:50:45,881
Yes.

1347
01:50:47,477 --> 01:50:49,367
You're going to help us trap him.

1348
01:50:50,166 --> 01:50:52,181
Please show Miss Williams where she's working.

1349
01:50:52,391 --> 01:50:54,029
Right this way.

1350
01:50:57,850 --> 01:51:00,370
How old were you when you built your first machine?

1351
01:51:00,538 --> 01:51:01,558
Three.

1352
01:51:01,727 --> 01:51:05,380
My stepdad was a car mechanic. He wanted to build airplanes.

1353
01:51:05,550 --> 01:51:07,929
He gave me these tools and let me just work it out.

1354
01:51:12,050 --> 01:51:14,344
So who taught you how to do all that you do?

1355
01:51:14,641 --> 01:51:15,958
My big brother.

1356
01:51:19,016 --> 01:51:22,457
I was the tip of the spear of Wakanda's army.

1357
01:51:22,627 --> 01:51:25,006
This is not me.

1358
01:51:25,601 --> 01:51:27,767
Besides, I'm a civilian now.

1359
01:51:28,914 --> 01:51:30,231
I turned in my weapon.

1360
01:51:30,953 --> 01:51:32,609
I built you a new spear as well.

1361
01:51:34,479 --> 01:51:35,566
A new one?

1362
01:51:35,650 --> 01:51:36,696
Yes.

1363
01:51:38,077 --> 01:51:40,544
What is this contraption's name anyway?

1364
01:51:40,670 --> 01:51:42,051
The Midnight Angel.

1365
01:51:42,259 --> 01:51:43,724
Midnight Angel?

1366
01:51:43,849 --> 01:51:45,648
Listen to me.

1367
01:51:46,736 --> 01:51:48,953
This will even the odds against them.

1368
01:51:49,079 --> 01:51:51,463
Sister, I need you to be ready when I call you.

1369
01:51:53,303 --> 01:51:54,517
Please.

1370
01:51:59,202 --> 01:52:00,531
Shuri.

1371
01:52:01,150 --> 01:52:02,372
Yes.

1372
01:52:03,931 --> 01:52:05,616
How many of these did you make?

1373
01:52:07,765 --> 01:52:09,744
I looked for you at the Jabari outpost.

1374
01:52:09,913 --> 01:52:11,555
I won't be forced out of my home.

1375
01:52:11,724 --> 01:52:14,336
You have such a rebellious spirit.

1376
01:52:14,421 --> 01:52:15,853
Why did you join the Dora?

1377
01:52:16,906 --> 01:52:18,085
Why do you care?

1378
01:52:25,415 --> 01:52:27,986
I still have a lot of fight left in me.

1379
01:52:28,407 --> 01:52:31,567
Tell me, Aneka, daughter of Kyana...

1380
01:52:32,325 --> 01:52:34,473
do you still have some fight left in you?

1381
01:52:34,642 --> 01:52:37,169
What do you have in mind?

1382
01:53:01,982 --> 01:53:02,997
GRIOT...

1383
01:53:04,691 --> 01:53:06,044
what's the confidence rate?

1384
01:53:06,806 --> 01:53:09,090
98.7%, Princess.

1385
01:53:09,386 --> 01:53:13,195
Would you like me to print the Heart-Shaped Herb?

1386
01:53:16,325 --> 01:53:18,737
Hey, Shuri.

1387
01:53:19,584 --> 01:53:21,911
Thought you'd be back in Haiti by now.

1388
01:53:22,969 --> 01:53:24,618
I'm still Wakandan, you know.

1389
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:29,686
So...

1390
01:53:31,029 --> 01:53:33,965
this is what you've been up to.

1391
01:53:34,761 --> 01:53:35,935
Yes.

1392
01:53:36,103 --> 01:53:38,030
What you have here, now...

1393
01:53:39,329 --> 01:53:43,563
is a chance to restore Wakanda's protector.

1394
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:49,095
It would be the greatest gift...

1395
01:53:49,472 --> 01:53:51,944
since Bashenga's discovery.

1396
01:53:57,058 --> 01:53:59,363
We'll soon find out. Come.

1397
01:54:02,507 --> 01:54:03,932
- GRIOT? - Yes, Princess.

1398
01:54:04,015 --> 01:54:05,021
Print it.

1399
01:54:09,212 --> 01:54:11,015
How will we know if it works?

1400
01:54:11,811 --> 01:54:13,027
If it glows.

1401
01:54:22,205 --> 01:54:23,420
You did it!

1402
01:54:28,241 --> 01:54:30,671
I mean, shouldn't we be burning incense or something?

1403
01:54:31,216 --> 01:54:34,401
Only Bast knows how the ancestors will make it to this lab.

1404
01:54:44,796 --> 01:54:46,723
Are you sure you don't want me to bury you?

1405
01:54:46,891 --> 01:54:47,939
No.

1406
01:54:48,506 --> 01:54:50,645
Need you to have access to my chest...

1407
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:53,002
just in case I go through cardiac arrest.

1408
01:54:53,570 --> 01:54:55,185
"Cardiac arrest"?

1409
01:54:56,319 --> 01:54:57,374
She's joking...

1410
01:54:57,922 --> 01:54:59,116
right?

1411
01:55:01,026 --> 01:55:02,041
Right?

1412
01:55:07,032 --> 01:55:11,008
Allow this Heart-Shaped Herb...

1413
01:55:11,303 --> 01:55:14,476
to give you the strength of the Black Panther...

1414
01:55:14,856 --> 01:55:17,351
and take you to the Ancestral Plane.

1415
01:55:19,804 --> 01:55:21,199
Ramonda.

1416
01:55:21,665 --> 01:55:26,740
We beg of you, come to your daughter.

1417
01:56:37,748 --> 01:56:38,763
Mother?

1418
01:56:52,297 --> 01:56:53,552
N'Jadaka.

1419
01:56:54,096 --> 01:56:55,267
Lil' cousin.

1420
01:56:55,685 --> 01:56:56,689
How?

1421
01:56:56,899 --> 01:56:59,575
How is never as important as why, right?

1422
01:57:01,375 --> 01:57:02,587
You chose me.

1423
01:57:02,797 --> 01:57:05,683
Impossible. I would never choose you.

1424
01:57:05,851 --> 01:57:07,482
Why did you take the Herb?

1425
01:57:08,486 --> 01:57:09,490
To see my family.

1426
01:57:09,574 --> 01:57:10,578
No, that's bullshit.

1427
01:57:11,540 --> 01:57:14,509
You didn't believe the Ancestral Plane was real, did you?

1428
01:57:17,647 --> 01:57:18,651
No.

1429
01:57:19,362 --> 01:57:20,659
So, why did you take it, then?

1430
01:57:22,333 --> 01:57:23,713
You don't have to lie to me.

1431
01:57:24,549 --> 01:57:26,097
So I can be strong.

1432
01:57:26,390 --> 01:57:27,979
Strong to do what?

1433
01:57:30,824 --> 01:57:31,870
See?

1434
01:57:33,417 --> 01:57:35,384
We're more alike than you think.

1435
01:57:37,308 --> 01:57:39,232
I took it to avenge my ancestors too.

1436
01:57:39,441 --> 01:57:40,612
I'm nothing like you.

1437
01:57:42,035 --> 01:57:43,792
You took it for yourself...

1438
01:57:44,001 --> 01:57:45,507
then destroyed the rest.

1439
01:57:47,054 --> 01:57:48,226
Unworthy king...

1440
01:57:49,104 --> 01:57:50,569
afraid of being replaced.

1441
01:57:51,656 --> 01:57:52,670
Just a coward.

1442
01:57:52,797 --> 01:57:53,811
No.

1443
01:57:54,023 --> 01:57:56,643
I had the courage to do what was necessary to change Wakanda.

1444
01:57:58,080 --> 01:57:59,559
How many people like your scientist...

1445
01:57:59,729 --> 01:58:02,094
did Wakanda protect before I took the throne?

1446
01:58:03,151 --> 01:58:04,166
Cowards.

1447
01:58:04,335 --> 01:58:07,462
That was the Panthers that came before me...

1448
01:58:07,631 --> 01:58:08,645
and before T'Challa.

1449
01:58:08,857 --> 01:58:10,674
Don't mention my brother.

1450
01:58:11,054 --> 01:58:12,660
You're the reason why he's dead.

1451
01:58:13,251 --> 01:58:16,547
You burnt the Herb, left us with no protector.

1452
01:58:16,717 --> 01:58:18,914
Then Namor struck and killed my mother.

1453
01:58:19,126 --> 01:58:20,943
Their blood is on your hands.

1454
01:58:22,169 --> 01:58:23,479
That ain't on me.

1455
01:58:24,112 --> 01:58:25,465
And don't you dare...

1456
01:58:25,592 --> 01:58:27,494
take that away from your mother.

1457
01:58:27,663 --> 01:58:31,255
She sacrificed her life to protect a young girl from the lost tribe.

1458
01:58:32,607 --> 01:58:35,312
Your father, he was a hypocrite.

1459
01:58:36,833 --> 01:58:38,650
He would've killed that girl.

1460
01:58:39,326 --> 01:58:41,271
Shit, he killed his own brother.

1461
01:58:42,919 --> 01:58:45,538
T'Challa was too noble.

1462
01:58:47,779 --> 01:58:50,187
He let the man who murdered your father live.

1463
01:58:52,342 --> 01:58:53,991
And here you stand.

1464
01:58:59,781 --> 01:59:01,936
Are you gonna be noble like your brother...

1465
01:59:02,105 --> 01:59:04,219
or take care of business...

1466
01:59:04,937 --> 01:59:06,058
like me?

1467
01:59:08,798 --> 01:59:09,795
Are you okay?

1468
01:59:11,955 --> 01:59:13,160
Are you OK?

1469
01:59:15,693 --> 01:59:16,780
Who did you see?

1470
01:59:22,303 --> 01:59:23,318
No one.

1471
01:59:26,577 --> 01:59:27,603
What's going on?

1472
01:59:28,302 --> 01:59:29,617
I failed.

1473
01:59:29,822 --> 01:59:30,726
It didn't work.

1474
01:59:30,932 --> 01:59:31,953
Hey, Shuri.

1475
01:59:35,101 --> 01:59:36,071
They abandoned me.

1476
01:59:36,282 --> 01:59:37,464
They would never do that.

1477
01:59:37,633 --> 01:59:39,151
I did everything I was supposed to do.

1478
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:40,628
I re-created the Herb.

1479
01:59:40,797 --> 01:59:43,201
- Okay. - I just did your stupid ritual, and for what?

1480
01:59:43,412 --> 01:59:44,930
- Relax. - Why didn't they come for me?

1481
01:59:45,057 --> 01:59:46,154
Just relax.

1482
01:59:53,409 --> 01:59:54,676
Shit.

1483
01:59:59,021 --> 02:00:00,413
Can I get some of that too?

1484
02:00:07,964 --> 02:00:09,019
I think...

1485
02:00:10,538 --> 02:00:12,057
you're going to need a suit.

1486
02:00:44,075 --> 02:00:46,016
There are more people coming from the city.

1487
02:00:46,185 --> 02:00:47,704
They need more space.

1488
02:00:47,915 --> 02:00:48,928
So what?

1489
02:00:49,773 --> 02:00:52,137
You are visitors.

1490
02:00:52,305 --> 02:00:55,683
It is a wonder how anything gets done with you people.

1491
02:01:21,606 --> 02:01:23,253
The princess!

1492
02:01:57,198 --> 02:01:58,590
She has done it!

1493
02:01:59,267 --> 02:02:02,349
The Black Panther lives!

1494
02:02:20,376 --> 02:02:22,868
Namor believes Wakanda is on her knees.

1495
02:02:25,359 --> 02:02:26,752
Our Queen murdered.

1496
02:02:29,369 --> 02:02:30,847
Our capital destroyed.

1497
02:02:32,620 --> 02:02:34,478
He believes we have no protector.

1498
02:02:36,462 --> 02:02:37,476
But now...

1499
02:02:39,249 --> 02:02:41,360
now is our time to strike.

1500
02:02:41,486 --> 02:02:45,160
How, when we don't even know how to find him?

1501
02:02:45,708 --> 02:02:47,523
We'll bring Namor to us.

1502
02:02:47,692 --> 02:02:49,128
- Here, again? - No.

1503
02:02:49,382 --> 02:02:51,788
A distant location at sea.

1504
02:02:51,872 --> 02:02:52,878
All right.

1505
02:02:53,339 --> 02:02:54,931
Let's say this does work.

1506
02:02:57,279 --> 02:02:58,997
Assuming we can kill this man...

1507
02:02:59,164 --> 02:03:02,223
who can fly and is potentially as strong as the Hulk...

1508
02:03:04,905 --> 02:03:07,378
is murdering him the right solution?

1509
02:03:07,755 --> 02:03:09,724
You were calling for his head...

1510
02:03:09,892 --> 02:03:12,322
when his only crime was intimidation.

1511
02:03:12,490 --> 02:03:14,251
What has changed, Lord M'Baku?

1512
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:15,675
His soldiers...

1513
02:03:15,843 --> 02:03:17,436
did not call him General or King.

1514
02:03:17,602 --> 02:03:20,285
They called him K'uk'ulkan.

1515
02:03:20,453 --> 02:03:21,668
What is that?

1516
02:03:21,878 --> 02:03:24,015
The feather serpent god.

1517
02:03:24,517 --> 02:03:25,555
What?

1518
02:03:25,729 --> 02:03:27,719
Do you think because we are living in the mountains...

1519
02:03:27,893 --> 02:03:29,882
we do not have access to books?

1520
02:03:30,402 --> 02:03:31,786
Elders...

1521
02:03:32,089 --> 02:03:33,560
with your permission...

1522
02:03:33,820 --> 02:03:37,541
I would like to talk with Lord M'Baku alone.

1523
02:03:38,536 --> 02:03:39,376
Yes.

1524
02:03:39,705 --> 02:03:40,706
Yes.

1525
02:03:47,673 --> 02:03:48,882
Namor's not finished.

1526
02:03:50,384 --> 02:03:53,470
He promised to destroy the surface world.

1527
02:03:53,637 --> 02:03:55,973
Now is our opportunity to take him.

1528
02:03:56,098 --> 02:03:58,350
- What are you afraid of? - War.

1529
02:03:58,810 --> 02:04:02,147
If Namor is indeed a god to his people...

1530
02:04:02,272 --> 02:04:04,941
killing him will risk eternal war.

1531
02:04:05,108 --> 02:04:06,202
And so what?

1532
02:04:06,665 --> 02:04:09,064
Was my mother's life not worth eternal war?

1533
02:04:09,275 --> 02:04:10,580
Of course it was.

1534
02:04:11,717 --> 02:04:15,841
Of course she was.

1535
02:04:17,863 --> 02:04:21,104
But it is not what she would have wanted for you.

1536
02:04:26,450 --> 02:04:28,259
And it is not what I want...

1537
02:04:30,869 --> 02:04:32,764
for my people.

1538
02:04:43,161 --> 02:04:46,234
You speak of my mother as if she's still here.

1539
02:04:47,161 --> 02:04:49,181
Of what she would've wanted for me.

1540
02:04:50,275 --> 02:04:52,633
Her hopes and her dreams.

1541
02:04:55,790 --> 02:04:57,221
But she's dead.

1542
02:04:58,274 --> 02:04:59,284
She's gone!

1543
02:05:01,136 --> 02:05:05,051
Namor drowned her, right in front of me!

1544
02:05:06,397 --> 02:05:07,661
So, her dreams...

1545
02:05:07,829 --> 02:05:10,944
her goals, her hopes for me...

1546
02:05:14,396 --> 02:05:15,658
it doesn't exist.

1547
02:05:18,352 --> 02:05:19,952
It doesn't matter anymore.

1548
02:05:22,057 --> 02:05:24,962
What matters is what I want...

1549
02:05:25,129 --> 02:05:27,824
and what I want is Namor dead!

1550
02:05:31,823 --> 02:05:34,559
And you're going to help me get it.

1551
02:05:41,126 --> 02:05:42,305
Are we clear?

1552
02:05:49,924 --> 02:05:51,650
We leave in the morning.

1553
02:06:17,706 --> 02:06:18,716
Hi.

1554
02:06:18,927 --> 02:06:19,896
Good morning.

1555
02:06:22,466 --> 02:06:23,772
If we survive this...

1556
02:06:25,373 --> 02:06:28,618
I want you to know you have a home with me in Haiti.

1557
02:06:31,566 --> 02:06:33,800
Here. Take my hands.

1558
02:06:37,171 --> 02:06:38,179
Breathe.

1559
02:06:42,591 --> 02:06:45,197
Shuri, I want you to be honest with me.

1560
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:48,390
Who did you see when you took the Herb?

1561
02:06:53,642 --> 02:06:55,365
If you go to war for vengeance...

1562
02:06:55,533 --> 02:06:57,887
it will not fill the hole left from her loss.

1563
02:06:58,559 --> 02:07:00,408
It will only grow larger...

1564
02:07:00,618 --> 02:07:02,089
and it will consume you.

1565
02:07:04,273 --> 02:07:05,661
It already has.

1566
02:07:11,207 --> 02:07:17,928
K'uk'ulkan, another machine to detect vibranium is in use in the ocean.

1567
02:07:18,949 --> 02:07:19,958
Where?

1568
02:07:49,635 --> 02:07:50,812
Get out of the water!

1569
02:08:35,833 --> 02:08:37,143
For the Queen.

1570
02:09:52,209 --> 02:09:53,941
Riri, how's it going up there?

1571
02:09:54,533 --> 02:09:55,757
Hey, Mr. GRIOT.

1572
02:09:55,884 --> 02:09:57,279
I could really use that backup right now.

1573
02:09:57,489 --> 02:09:59,433
I thought you'd never ask.

1574
02:10:05,389 --> 02:10:06,403
Shit.

1575
02:10:10,838 --> 02:10:12,275
Shit, he's fast.

1576
02:10:12,909 --> 02:10:14,176
But I'm faster.

1577
02:10:34,410 --> 02:10:35,465
I got you.

1578
02:10:41,878 --> 02:10:43,269
It's on you now, Shuri.

1579
02:10:52,593 --> 02:10:54,195
- Princess. - No.

1580
02:10:54,407 --> 02:10:57,992
I am the Black Panther, and I'm here for retribution!

1581
02:10:58,583 --> 02:11:01,620
Pervaporation cells activated.

1582
02:11:11,197 --> 02:11:12,205
What's wrong?

1583
02:11:13,003 --> 02:11:14,264
You need a glass of water?

1584
02:11:18,255 --> 02:11:19,347
Yo, we got him.

1585
02:11:19,432 --> 02:11:21,155
- Good! - Namor has been captured.

1586
02:11:21,449 --> 02:11:22,626
Retreat back!

1587
02:11:27,626 --> 02:11:29,054
Back to Wakanda!

1588
02:11:34,895 --> 02:11:35,896
Move out!

1589
02:12:00,952 --> 02:12:02,119
What is going on?

1590
02:12:02,953 --> 02:12:04,829
The sonic emitter has been destroyed.

1591
02:12:27,009 --> 02:12:28,509
That can't be good.

1592
02:13:00,569 --> 02:13:02,737
Panther, the Sea Leopard has lost power...

1593
02:13:02,946 --> 02:13:04,905
and they are experiencing significant casualties.

1594
02:13:06,490 --> 02:13:07,448
Okoye.

1595
02:13:07,657 --> 02:13:08,949
Panther.

1596
02:13:09,991 --> 02:13:11,117
Aneka.

1597
02:13:12,368 --> 02:13:13,364
Okoye.

1598
02:13:13,529 --> 02:13:14,775
It is time.

1599
02:13:25,564 --> 02:13:26,596
For Wakanda!

1600
02:13:27,380 --> 02:13:28,578
Wakanda!

1601
02:13:36,834 --> 02:13:38,485
GRIOT, what's the damage?

1602
02:13:38,609 --> 02:13:40,838
Catastrophic. His spear is made of raw vibranium.

1603
02:13:40,962 --> 02:13:43,398
- The ship could explode at any second. - Get us to the desert.

1604
02:14:02,015 --> 02:14:03,006
No!

1605
02:14:31,367 --> 02:14:32,854
Sink the ship!

1606
02:15:00,182 --> 02:15:01,173
I got you, sis.

1607
02:15:01,337 --> 02:15:02,328
Hold on.

1608
02:16:05,902 --> 02:16:07,306
Warrior!

1609
02:16:10,691 --> 02:16:12,961
You speak the mother tongue?

1610
02:16:13,292 --> 02:16:15,644
You can greet your ancestors with it...

1611
02:16:45,409 --> 02:16:46,689
Get off me!

1612
02:16:58,496 --> 02:16:59,775
All right, come here.

1613
02:17:03,037 --> 02:17:06,380
You will greet your ancestors.

1614
02:17:30,117 --> 02:17:31,645
May the ancestors save us...

1615
02:17:31,892 --> 02:17:33,378
if the princess does not hurry.

1616
02:17:33,543 --> 02:17:35,319
We may be going to join them.

1617
02:17:36,185 --> 02:17:37,259
If so, hey...

1618
02:17:37,383 --> 02:17:39,571
let us take as many of them with us as we can.

1619
02:18:09,376 --> 02:18:10,780
It could've been different.

1620
02:18:15,444 --> 02:18:16,807
I need water.

1621
02:18:33,402 --> 02:18:35,507
Are you gonna be noble like your brother...

1622
02:18:35,714 --> 02:18:37,076
or take care of business...

1623
02:18:37,159 --> 02:18:38,190
like me?

1624
02:18:38,356 --> 02:18:39,966
I'm not my brother.

1625
02:18:41,328 --> 02:18:43,392
Namor will beg me for mercy...

1626
02:18:44,011 --> 02:18:46,488
as I stand and watch as he dies.

1627
02:19:24,963 --> 02:19:27,399
Imperius Rex.

1628
02:19:29,999 --> 02:19:31,155
Wakanda forever!

1629
02:21:18,777 --> 02:21:20,263
Shuri.

1630
02:21:21,749 --> 02:21:22,733
Mama.

1631
02:21:25,605 --> 02:21:26,958
Show him...

1632
02:21:27,327 --> 02:21:28,763
who you are.

1633
02:21:35,612 --> 02:21:36,603
Yield...

1634
02:21:37,678 --> 02:21:39,992
and Wakanda will protect your oceans.

1635
02:21:40,156 --> 02:21:42,470
We will protect your secrets.

1636
02:21:42,677 --> 02:21:43,669
Yield...

1637
02:21:44,908 --> 02:21:46,560
and your people will live.

1638
02:21:50,567 --> 02:21:52,922
Vengeance has consumed us.

1639
02:21:53,253 --> 02:21:55,980
We cannot let it consume our people.

1640
02:22:04,614 --> 02:22:06,431
I yield.

1641
02:22:31,177 --> 02:22:33,367
Talokanile'ex!

1642
02:22:35,226 --> 02:22:36,631
Let us return home.

1643
02:22:37,291 --> 02:22:38,654
Our fight here is done.

1644
02:22:51,420 --> 02:22:53,237
Wakanda forever!

1645
02:22:53,775 --> 02:22:55,261
Wakanda forever!

1646
02:23:39,232 --> 02:23:40,677
Thank you, my love.

1647
02:24:04,334 --> 02:24:05,408
Yo.

1648
02:24:09,909 --> 02:24:11,065
All set to head home?

1649
02:24:11,230 --> 02:24:13,665
As long as you're sure the police won't be waiting for me at the airport.

1650
02:24:13,872 --> 02:24:15,523
Don't worry. Took care of that.

1651
02:24:15,689 --> 02:24:19,239
But you might want to slow down on your homework-for-hire business.

1652
02:24:19,446 --> 02:24:21,758
Get caught slipping, I can't help you with that.

1653
02:24:22,914 --> 02:24:24,854
They said you wanted to talk to me about something?

1654
02:24:24,979 --> 02:24:25,970
Yes.

1655
02:24:26,217 --> 02:24:29,396
Your suit. It's a great design...

1656
02:24:30,057 --> 02:24:31,172
but can't let you leave with it.

1657
02:24:31,337 --> 02:24:32,531
It's all good.

1658
02:24:32,738 --> 02:24:35,621
Figured the least I could do is help Wakanda clean up my mess.

1659
02:24:36,940 --> 02:24:38,340
I have one more thing to show you.

1660
02:24:38,794 --> 02:24:39,783
Come.

1661
02:24:43,738 --> 02:24:46,786
Took me a while to find all the parts from the river...

1662
02:24:46,951 --> 02:24:48,352
but it was worth it.

1663
02:24:48,970 --> 02:24:49,959
How did you...

1664
02:24:51,319 --> 02:24:52,761
It's my dad's car.

1665
02:24:54,039 --> 02:24:55,769
We used to work on it before...

1666
02:25:01,662 --> 02:25:03,475
- You sure this is her? - Every part.

1667
02:25:03,681 --> 02:25:05,123
Have it shipped to Boston.

1668
02:25:05,206 --> 02:25:06,483
Be there before you arrive.

1669
02:25:12,129 --> 02:25:13,123
Bring it in, man.

1670
02:25:16,519 --> 02:25:20,784
Panther, Miss Williams' transport has arrived.

1671
02:25:21,530 --> 02:25:22,938
Look after yourself.

1672
02:25:23,352 --> 02:25:25,754
Sure you're not trying to slide to Chicago?

1673
02:25:25,836 --> 02:25:26,914
Catch a Bulls game?

1674
02:25:28,156 --> 02:25:32,670
Sounds fun, but I have something I need to take care of.

1675
02:25:57,145 --> 02:25:59,713
And now I present to you...

1676
02:25:59,837 --> 02:26:00,997
Princess Shuri...

1677
02:26:01,079 --> 02:26:02,405
the Black Panther!

1678
02:26:20,709 --> 02:26:23,608
The Black Panther sends her regards...

1679
02:26:24,395 --> 02:26:26,341
but she will not be joining us today.

1680
02:26:27,501 --> 02:26:29,406
I, M'Baku...

1681
02:26:29,613 --> 02:26:32,056
leader of the Jabari Tribe...

1682
02:26:32,222 --> 02:26:33,796
son of Wakanda...

1683
02:26:35,162 --> 02:26:37,012
wish to challenge...

1684
02:26:38,081 --> 02:26:39,151
for the throne.

1685
02:26:44,742 --> 02:26:46,431
What is troubling you, my child?

1686
02:26:48,286 --> 02:26:55,166
I looked forward to fighting alongside you my entire life...

1687
02:26:56,115 --> 02:27:01,141
The thought of you kneeling to the Wakandans...

1688
02:27:01,553 --> 02:27:06,250
The Black Panther had every reason to kill me.

1689
02:27:07,074 --> 02:27:10,164
Why do you think she didn't go through with it?

1690
02:27:12,060 --> 02:27:16,427
The Black Panther is the most powerful person

1691
02:27:16,798 --> 02:27:22,526
in the most powerful nation on the surface.

1692
02:27:22,691 --> 02:27:25,657
But she has no allies.

1693
02:27:26,069 --> 02:27:30,642
Now she has empathy for the people of Talokan.

1694
02:27:32,456 --> 02:27:34,516
With this alliance...

1695
02:27:35,174 --> 02:27:42,138
Talokan will be stronger than ever.

1696
02:27:42,550 --> 02:27:46,341
The surface world will come for Wakanda

1697
02:27:47,247 --> 02:27:50,091
and Wakanda will turn to us.

1698
02:27:51,697 --> 02:27:53,346
Trust me.

1699
02:28:09,868 --> 02:28:11,034
What the hell is this?

1700
02:28:11,242 --> 02:28:12,450
Can we turn around?

1701
02:28:14,116 --> 02:28:16,073
I don't know, man. We'll lose an hour.

1702
02:28:17,448 --> 02:28:18,904
Why don't you go check it out?

1703
02:28:19,030 --> 02:28:20,237
Okay.

1704
02:28:23,069 --> 02:28:24,360
Yeah, this is Shauver.

1705
02:28:24,736 --> 02:28:26,735
Yeah, looks like we got a tree blocking our way.

1706
02:28:26,900 --> 02:28:28,692
How do you want us to proceed?

1707
02:28:29,150 --> 02:28:30,149
What the...

1708
02:28:42,172 --> 02:28:44,420
A colonizer in chains.

1709
02:28:45,168 --> 02:28:47,249
Now I have seen everything.

1710
02:28:47,415 --> 02:28:48,414
Funny.

1711
02:28:49,162 --> 02:28:50,194
Let's go.

1712
02:29:16,637 --> 02:29:17,627
Thank you.

1713
02:29:17,710 --> 02:29:18,700
You're welcome.

1714
02:29:23,609 --> 02:29:24,586
Hey.

1715
02:29:25,889 --> 02:29:27,475
Welcome!

1716
02:29:29,226 --> 02:29:30,610
It's good to see you.

1717
02:29:31,343 --> 02:29:32,523
Everything is ready.

1718
02:29:32,686 --> 02:29:33,989
Just give me one moment, eh?

1719
02:29:34,151 --> 02:29:35,494
Actually...

1720
02:29:35,657 --> 02:29:37,448
I think I should do it on my own.

1721
02:29:38,669 --> 02:29:39,991
Of course.

1722
02:34:12,377 --> 02:34:13,363
Shuri...

1723
02:34:14,596 --> 02:34:16,362
can we join you now?

1724
02:34:19,402 --> 02:34:22,400
This is my son, Toussaint.

1725
02:34:23,550 --> 02:34:24,581
Toussaint...

1726
02:34:25,182 --> 02:34:28,403
this is your aunty, Shuri.

1727
02:34:29,950 --> 02:34:30,946
Hi.

1728
02:34:51,775 --> 02:34:54,347
We agreed it was better for him to grow up here.

1729
02:34:54,596 --> 02:34:57,667
Away from the pressure of the throne.

1730
02:34:59,036 --> 02:35:00,224
Your father...

1731
02:35:00,838 --> 02:35:02,516
your baba...

1732
02:35:02,680 --> 02:35:05,342
prepared us for his death, didn't he?

1733
02:35:09,846 --> 02:35:11,853
But he didn't want us to go to the funeral...

1734
02:35:12,672 --> 02:35:15,579
because he felt the time was not yet right.

1735
02:35:16,316 --> 02:35:18,978
So we had our own ceremony for him here.

1736
02:35:20,739 --> 02:35:22,296
Did my mother meet him?

1737
02:35:22,377 --> 02:35:23,369
She did.

1738
02:35:32,915 --> 02:35:33,947
It's nice to meet you.

1739
02:35:34,154 --> 02:35:35,352
Nice to meet you.

1740
02:35:35,477 --> 02:35:37,088
Toussaint is a beautiful name.

1741
02:35:37,501 --> 02:35:39,650
It holds a great history.

1742
02:35:39,857 --> 02:35:43,121
Thanks. Yours is cool, too, I guess.

1743
02:35:46,386 --> 02:35:48,452
My mom says you are good at keeping secrets.

1744
02:35:48,534 --> 02:35:49,597
Is that true?

1745
02:35:50,742 --> 02:35:53,563
Yes, I can keep a good secret.

1746
02:35:56,507 --> 02:35:58,795
Toussaint is my Haitian name.

1747
02:36:01,697 --> 02:36:02,842
Who are you?

1748
02:36:03,742 --> 02:36:07,870
My name is Prince T'Challa, son of King T'Challa.
