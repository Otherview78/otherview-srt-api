2
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:38,253
Ya know Ousmane Dembélé?

3
00:00:38,293 --> 00:00:40,293
I got fifty on Mbappé.

4
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,413
What's up?

5
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:45,173
Gonna watch the game?

6
00:00:45,693 --> 00:00:47,853
Bet you five that Mbappé scores.

7
00:00:49,693 --> 00:00:50,693
You're crazy.

8
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:53,013
Double score. Bet you five bucks!

9
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:06,293
Go the Blues, go the Blues!

10
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:29,093
I like your hairdo,

11
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:30,573
real nice.

12
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:35,693
You use engine oil
or it's naturally greasy?

13
00:04:38,413 --> 00:04:39,213
Know what?

14
00:04:39,373 --> 00:04:41,373
Let's call new guy "Greaser".

15
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:44,693
Dig it. Approved!

16
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,173
Not a big fan.

17
00:04:52,253 --> 00:04:53,533
Greetings gents.

18
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:55,773
Go France!

19
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:57,053
Fuck off!

20
00:05:00,573 --> 00:05:01,853
Greaser, listen up.

21
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:04,813
We're in the Bosquets, you heard of it?

22
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:08,653
Before it was inaccessible to us.
A prime drug spot.

23
00:05:08,693 --> 00:05:11,533
There was hash, coke, then heroin.

24
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:12,853
It ruined the hood.

25
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:14,213
All the OGs died.

26
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,013
Then the M. bros cleaned things up.

27
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:19,533
Muslim Brotherhood?

28
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:21,093
Yeah, the SCU.

29
00:05:22,453 --> 00:05:24,453
As in Street Crime Unit?

30
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:26,093
Smack Combat Unit.

31
00:05:26,373 --> 00:05:28,133
That's what we call them.

32
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:30,853
Prostitution is the new plague,

33
00:05:30,893 --> 00:05:32,373
run by Nigerians.

34
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:35,413
They rent flats for 400 euros.

35
00:05:37,173 --> 00:05:40,933
Hookers turn tricks
for 10 to 20 euros.

36
00:05:41,573 --> 00:05:43,213
Blowjobs are 2 euros.

37
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:47,493
Got 2 euros?

38
00:06:02,813 --> 00:06:04,293
What's up prick face?

39
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,813
How's Bert and Ernie?

40
00:06:05,853 --> 00:06:07,373
Can't complain.

41
00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:09,533
I left a mess at your house.

42
00:06:09,573 --> 00:06:12,893
Your wife's face broke the armrest...

43
00:06:12,933 --> 00:06:14,213
You fool.

44
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:16,053
You good?

45
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:20,493
You didn't pick the winning team.

46
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:23,493
You're working
with the two biggest clowns.

47
00:06:23,973 --> 00:06:24,933
My advice,

48
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:28,133
do night shifts,
join the elite force.

49
00:06:28,173 --> 00:06:29,893
Know why you ride nights?

50
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:32,213
You know?

51
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:33,733
Cuz you the ugliest.

52
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:35,733
Know who else rides?

53
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:41,533
Don't bother calling me!

54
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:43,933
You keep him. He drives me crazy...

55
00:06:44,373 --> 00:06:46,173
He drives me crazy, get it?

56
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:48,573
If you had kids, you'd get it.

57
00:06:48,613 --> 00:06:50,933
I keep telling him, over and over.

58
00:06:50,973 --> 00:06:53,653
He messes up, he's on his own now!

59
00:06:53,693 --> 00:06:55,053
What did he do now?

60
00:06:55,773 --> 00:06:57,653
Stole a bag full of hens.

61
00:06:59,493 --> 00:07:00,653
Live chickens?

62
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:01,653
That's right.

63
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:04,893
From a gypsy who turned his garage
into a chicken coop.

64
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:06,493
To sell or eat?

65
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:08,653
What do I know?

66
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,693
He doesn't care about anything.

67
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:11,973
You hear me?

68
00:07:21,293 --> 00:07:22,613
Set yourself up over there.

69
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,413
Nice pig collection.

70
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:31,853
"Pink Pig", that's his nickname
and he's proud of it.

71
00:07:31,893 --> 00:07:33,413
100% swine!

72
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:42,933
So, not gonna miss the cows?

73
00:07:43,653 --> 00:07:44,733
What?

74
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,133
- The cows.
- No, why?

75
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:49,213
You from the countryside?

76
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:52,133
No, not gonna miss it.

77
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,533
New beginnings for you.

78
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:56,973
You never served with the SCU?

79
00:07:58,173 --> 00:08:00,933
I was a first responder,
then trained with the SCU.

80
00:08:05,613 --> 00:08:07,372
So why did you come here?

81
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:10,413
My ex, also a cop,
was transferred.

82
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:13,813
She has custody of our son
and I want see him more,

83
00:08:13,852 --> 00:08:15,333
so I followed her.

84
00:08:15,373 --> 00:08:16,373
That's why.

85
00:08:18,493 --> 00:08:19,773
Don't start!

86
00:08:22,613 --> 00:08:23,853
My favorite read.

87
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,373
<i>Shit life</i>

88
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:31,213
The backstreet boys!

89
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:33,893
The matriarch.

90
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:35,493
Corporal Ruiz.

91
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:37,653
Captain Chandier, pleasure.

92
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:39,653
- Treating you well?
- Great.

93
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:40,933
Perfect.

94
00:08:40,973 --> 00:08:43,853
35ọC forecast for today.
Apply sunscreen.

95
00:08:44,813 --> 00:08:45,853
Well, well.

96
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:48,813
Family's growing.

97
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:52,693
30ọC, people would be on the streets,

98
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,773
hanging out, it'd be chaos.

99
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:57,173
But 35ọC is perfect, they stay in...

100
00:08:57,613 --> 00:08:58,893
and rest.

101
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:01,773
Smooth.

102
00:09:03,573 --> 00:09:04,813
You shave?

103
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:07,493
I kept my baby skin.

104
00:09:08,853 --> 00:09:10,893
I'm jealous.

105
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:14,213
Let's enjoy the victory
while everyone's happy.

106
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,653
Corporal, see me in my office.

107
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:20,573
France is on its cloud nine.
Chris, come too.

108
00:09:25,653 --> 00:09:28,373
Chris is your unit sergeant.

109
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:31,453
He has solid field experience.

110
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:32,893
He's...

111
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,493
Let's see...

112
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,373
What would you say?
Sharp, reactive?

113
00:09:39,373 --> 00:09:41,333
Goes overboard sometimes?

114
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:44,853
You can't be shy around here.

115
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:49,493
Know that I don't approve
of inappropriate behavior.

116
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:51,813
- Understood?
- Absolutely.

117
00:09:51,853 --> 00:09:52,653
Good.

118
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:56,413
I appeal to your sense of duty,
Corporal Ruiz.

119
00:09:56,453 --> 00:09:59,093
Your team spirit. Solidarity.

120
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:01,053
No solidarity, no team.

121
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:03,733
No team, we are alone.

122
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:05,293
Alone against...

123
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,693
What would you say, Chris?

124
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:11,893
The brutality of our world.

125
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:15,813
I couldn't have said it better.

126
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:19,053
Dismissed.

127
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:20,773
Greaser,

128
00:10:20,813 --> 00:10:23,053
sit in the back.
Eyes open, mouth shut.

129
00:10:23,093 --> 00:10:24,853
Can we lose the nickname?

130
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:27,133
Greaser. Told you to zip it.

131
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,093
Beat it! You stink.

132
00:10:58,133 --> 00:10:59,493
Watch your mouth.

133
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,293
Sorry, Pop.

134
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,813
Out of bed now!

135
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:03,213
I'm on vacation!

136
00:11:03,253 --> 00:11:06,293
Don't argue, vacation or not.

137
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,653
Get up now.

138
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:23,933
Watch it. Riot Police.

139
00:11:28,173 --> 00:11:29,853
Running away from us?

140
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:32,493
Young brothers, little food for thought.

141
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,333
Right?

142
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:37,333
Success now and beyond depends on Allah

143
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:39,213
and Mohammed's path.

144
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:41,093
We, Muslim Brothers,

145
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,133
are here to talk. <i>Bismilah.</i>

146
00:11:43,373 --> 00:11:46,133
<i>As-Salaam-Alaikum</i> young brothers.
Y'all okay?

147
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:51,573
We came today to discuss complaints
regarding your behavior.

148
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:55,973
At the mosque,
your neighbors complain about you.

149
00:11:56,293 --> 00:11:59,053
In Islam, one's behavior
is very important.

150
00:11:59,933 --> 00:12:02,533
Towards yourselves, your elders, us,

151
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:06,053
your parents, and your neighbors.

152
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:07,773
Especially your neighbors.

153
00:12:07,813 --> 00:12:09,933
You must respect your elders,

154
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:12,413
and most of all mothers and fathers.

155
00:12:13,053 --> 00:12:14,053
Understood?

156
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:14,853
Yes.

157
00:12:14,893 --> 00:12:16,133
We can count on you?

158
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:18,613
After the prayer, <i>inshallah,</i>

159
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:20,773
join us at the mosque for a snack.

160
00:12:20,813 --> 00:12:24,093
Cake, candies, soft drinks...

161
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:25,613
and a little class.

162
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:28,413
Does that work for you guys?

163
00:12:28,453 --> 00:12:29,653
Are we good?

164
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:32,173
Alright little brothers.

165
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:39,573
See the guy at the bus stop?

166
00:13:39,613 --> 00:13:40,453
That one.

167
00:13:41,813 --> 00:13:43,613
Looks normal, right?

168
00:13:44,813 --> 00:13:46,573
He's a threat to national security.

169
00:13:46,853 --> 00:13:48,853
His beard used to be that long.

170
00:13:50,213 --> 00:13:52,373
Spent three years in Syria
beheading people.

171
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:56,253
A Quran and an AK on him at all times.

172
00:13:59,293 --> 00:14:01,013
See that guy with the cap?

173
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:03,893
Don't stare! You crazy?

174
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:06,333
He threw his chatty wife
out the window.

175
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,293
Thankfully she survived.

176
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,493
Illegals over there.

177
00:14:14,773 --> 00:14:16,453
So cholera, typhus...

178
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,813
Always wear gloves.
You never know.

179
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:23,853
One of the boys caught tetanus
while frisking.

180
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:25,773
You fucking with me?

181
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:29,013
Greaser...

182
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:31,693
Fun cultural fact.

183
00:14:32,173 --> 00:14:34,173
Know why the school's called
Victor Hugo?

184
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:37,133
He wrote <i>Les Misérables</i> here.

185
00:14:38,693 --> 00:14:41,093
We got a brain on board.

186
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:44,813
You read the novel?

187
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:46,693
I saw it on the town's website.

188
00:14:48,453 --> 00:14:50,933
Things haven't changed much.

189
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:54,573
Except that Gavroche is now "Gavaracha".

190
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:56,493
"Gavaracha, come herr."

191
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:57,973
"Right now."

192
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,253
Cosette is now "Coozette".

193
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:03,293
Her mom works at the post office.

194
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,373
Always tired...

195
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:07,173
She works too much.

196
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:09,333
Coozette...

197
00:15:15,093 --> 00:15:16,333
Check out Owl.

198
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:19,053
What up, scoundrels?

199
00:15:19,093 --> 00:15:20,653
Owl, they let you out?

200
00:15:20,693 --> 00:15:22,453
It was about time.

201
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:23,693
How long were you in?

202
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:24,933
Four years.

203
00:15:25,933 --> 00:15:27,613
We put you in, remember?

204
00:15:27,653 --> 00:15:30,893
Can't forget your face,
I don't like it.

205
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:32,893
No choice. Just doing our job.

206
00:15:33,373 --> 00:15:34,813
Can't change job?

207
00:15:34,853 --> 00:15:36,813
No. You pretty in that suit.

208
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,573
Looking for a job.

209
00:15:38,613 --> 00:15:40,653
Really? What kind of job?

210
00:15:40,693 --> 00:15:43,253
Landscaping, trimming, pruning...

211
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:44,053
Okay.

212
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:45,653
- It rhymes.
- Right.

213
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:48,933
- You still rap?
- Always, but no trap.

214
00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:51,213
Give us some bars, old school.

215
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:53,733
<i>Pull trigger, tension bigger</i>

216
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:55,573
<i>Check my take, state mistake</i>

217
00:15:55,613 --> 00:15:58,053
<i>Politics reprobate, riots create</i>

218
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:02,293
<i>Misdemeanor at stake
Just the son of an expatriate</i>

219
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,253
<i>State won't renovate
my building, district</i>

220
00:16:05,293 --> 00:16:08,093
<i>Change my ways if that's all it takes</i>

221
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,133
District 93.

222
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:10,933
- Sounds nice.
- Not bad?

223
00:16:10,973 --> 00:16:13,893
- Wise words you speak.
- Right.

224
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,973
You still need to get a job though.

225
00:16:17,013 --> 00:16:17,772
Of course.

226
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:19,572
- Your rap is...
- The bomb!

227
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:23,133
You alright, Owl. Good luck.

228
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:24,413
Same to you.

229
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:26,693
Wow, it got to him.

230
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:27,972
Prison killed him.

231
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:29,453
An old client.

232
00:16:30,252 --> 00:16:32,772
50 bucks I collar him within six months.

233
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:52,733
I'll buy you a drink.

234
00:16:52,773 --> 00:16:54,813
Hey, Kirikou!

235
00:16:58,253 --> 00:16:59,173
He keeps at it!

236
00:16:59,213 --> 00:17:00,733
He wants to go to the ER.

237
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:02,493
He's headed there.

238
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:05,453
He will, his head's about to bleed.

239
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:07,813
I forgot to tell you.

240
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:09,173
When I was back home,

241
00:17:09,213 --> 00:17:12,053
with my family, in my village...

242
00:17:12,093 --> 00:17:13,773
I was falling asleep.

243
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:17,413
I heard a noise,
a guy tried to steal a scooter.

244
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,533
- No scooters in the bush.
- Of course there are!

245
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,013
Come on, shut up.

246
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:25,093
Some guys grabbed him.

247
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:26,973
I was in shock.
They held him down.

248
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:29,573
Tied him up and set him on fire.

249
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:30,653
Traumatizing.

250
00:17:30,693 --> 00:17:32,013
Come on...

251
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:34,013
Swear to Allah.

252
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:36,973
They burned him alive.

253
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:39,373
You know how dust blows away?

254
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:40,733
Same with his ashes.

255
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:44,173
Crazy dangerous over there.

256
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:46,893
You get caught stealing, you die.

257
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:53,173
Told ya so!

258
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:54,533
What's up?

259
00:17:55,213 --> 00:17:57,253
- How you boys doing?
- Good.

260
00:17:57,893 --> 00:17:59,973
Looking nice.
What can I get you?

261
00:18:02,693 --> 00:18:03,813
Tortillas...

262
00:18:03,853 --> 00:18:06,973
1 panini, 2 grilled cheeses, 2 cokes

263
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:09,213
- 1 hamburger.
- 1 snickers.

264
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:11,133
- 2 corns.
- Wait.

265
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,533
That's a big order.

266
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:15,693
How much you got?

267
00:18:15,733 --> 00:18:16,893
12 euros.

268
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,133
- How much?
- 12 euros.

269
00:18:18,173 --> 00:18:20,573
Not gonna happen.
Go away.

270
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,653
We played sport, we're hungry.

271
00:18:24,173 --> 00:18:25,453
Out of here, scram.

272
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,733
- Come on, Uncle.
- No good.

273
00:18:31,213 --> 00:18:32,133
Goodbye.

274
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:41,253
<i>Join the circus
and watch international talents.</i>

275
00:18:41,293 --> 00:18:44,613
<i>Acrobats, jugglers, wild animals...</i>

276
00:18:44,653 --> 00:18:46,933
Maybe they'll hire you as a clown.

277
00:18:48,013 --> 00:18:49,293
You're a funny guy.

278
00:18:52,053 --> 00:18:53,333
Look at that.

279
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,093
Let's inspect them.

280
00:18:56,813 --> 00:18:58,053
What did they do?

281
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:00,253
Wake up, fellows! I smell smoke.

282
00:19:00,293 --> 00:19:01,293
Gwada, U-turn.

283
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,773
<i>Let's palpate...</i>

284
00:19:05,173 --> 00:19:07,253
<i>I'll frisk you</i>

285
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,333
<i>With passion</i>

286
00:19:11,613 --> 00:19:12,893
Gun it.

287
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,893
Let's pop Greaser's cherry.

288
00:19:35,813 --> 00:19:36,973
Hello ladies.

289
00:19:38,213 --> 00:19:39,373
Police check.

290
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:41,853
What you doing?

291
00:19:41,893 --> 00:19:42,973
Waiting for the bus.

292
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:44,253
- What?
- Waiting for the bus.

293
00:19:45,373 --> 00:19:46,613
Really?

294
00:19:50,813 --> 00:19:51,933
That yours?

295
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:00,173
How old are you?

296
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:01,413
Fifteen.

297
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:02,573
Fifteen?

298
00:20:02,613 --> 00:20:04,093
And you already smoke?

299
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:09,053
Smells like hash.

300
00:20:11,613 --> 00:20:12,853
Where'd you hide it?

301
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,133
You have no right!

302
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:16,213
I do what I want. Where is it?

303
00:20:16,253 --> 00:20:17,093
You have no right!

304
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:20,373
State of emergency,
I can stick a finger up your ass.

305
00:20:20,413 --> 00:20:21,613
- Sir.
- Shut up!

306
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:22,533
You have no right.

307
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:25,213
- Want me to arrest you?
- You have no right!

308
00:20:25,253 --> 00:20:26,733
- Leave it.
- I'll handle it.

309
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:30,573
Where's it from?
Want me to keep looking?

310
00:20:31,213 --> 00:20:32,013
What's that?

311
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:33,373
You're breaking the law.

312
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:34,333
Stop filming!

313
00:20:37,253 --> 00:20:38,413
Happy now?

314
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:39,693
Bitch!

315
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:41,853
Beat it!

316
00:20:41,893 --> 00:20:43,293
Quit smoking. It's bad for you.

317
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,093
Buzz!

318
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:16,653
Get your ass over here.

319
00:21:19,693 --> 00:21:21,413
You filmed me in my room?

320
00:21:21,453 --> 00:21:22,293
No, I swear.

321
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,213
It wasn't your drone at my window?

322
00:21:24,773 --> 00:21:26,613
Didn't know you were home.

323
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,373
Give me your phone.

324
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,253
Give it! Hurry, Buzz!

325
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,293
You filmed all the girls?

326
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:39,893
You're a real pervert.

327
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:40,853
I'm shocked.

328
00:21:46,053 --> 00:21:47,773
Oh shit, he filmed Salimata!

329
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:50,933
That hoe, check it out.

330
00:21:50,973 --> 00:21:52,333
She's pathetic.

331
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:54,453
Send it to me.
I'll put her on blast.

332
00:21:54,493 --> 00:21:55,413
Me too.

333
00:21:55,453 --> 00:21:56,933
What a hoe!

334
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,813
If you ever try to film me,

335
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:01,213
I'll fuck you up.

336
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:02,693
You'd better not.

337
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:04,253
Send me this video

338
00:22:04,293 --> 00:22:06,373
and delete the others, got it?

339
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:08,773
What you doing tomorrow?

340
00:22:08,813 --> 00:22:09,613
Nothing.

341
00:22:10,373 --> 00:22:11,173
Nothing.

342
00:22:11,613 --> 00:22:13,733
We got a basketball game at ten.

343
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,773
- Can you come?
- Sure.

344
00:22:15,813 --> 00:22:17,053
You gonna film the game.

345
00:22:17,093 --> 00:22:17,893
Okay.

346
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:19,053
- Speak up.
- Okay.

347
00:22:19,093 --> 00:22:20,293
Counting on you.

348
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,853
You'd better be there, Buzz.

349
00:22:22,653 --> 00:22:24,013
- Got it?
- Yes.

350
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:26,013
Let's go, girls.

351
00:22:44,173 --> 00:22:45,253
Jojo. My buddy.

352
00:22:46,293 --> 00:22:47,413
The boys in blue!

353
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:48,773
- What up?
- Chilling.

354
00:22:48,813 --> 00:22:50,053
What's good with y'all?

355
00:22:50,093 --> 00:22:51,693
Grilling under the sun.

356
00:22:51,733 --> 00:22:52,573
For us?

357
00:22:52,613 --> 00:22:53,453
Want a steak?

358
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:55,053
Tell me.

359
00:22:55,093 --> 00:22:57,013
We're good. Already ate.

360
00:22:58,173 --> 00:22:59,573
- Okay.
- Be safe now.

361
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:01,973
Same to you.

362
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,133
Later, Jojo.

363
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:06,573
Fellas, almost done!

364
00:23:09,893 --> 00:23:11,253
What's with the vests?

365
00:23:11,533 --> 00:23:13,453
They work for the mayor.

366
00:23:14,173 --> 00:23:17,053
When elevators break down,
they bring up groceries

367
00:23:17,093 --> 00:23:20,013
with fishing lines, like in prison.

368
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:22,533
Anyway...

369
00:23:22,853 --> 00:23:24,613
It's good the mayor does that.

370
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:26,893
We gotta pay him a visit.

371
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:27,733
That prick?

372
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:31,053
Why is he a prick?

373
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,773
The mayor's a prick?

374
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,213
That retard you just saw?

375
00:23:35,693 --> 00:23:37,053
He's the mayor's brother.

376
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:39,413
The mayor's black?

377
00:23:39,813 --> 00:23:40,773
Yup.

378
00:23:42,253 --> 00:23:43,653
Our very own Obama.

379
00:23:45,613 --> 00:23:47,653
You spoke to the Paki?

380
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:49,213
Yup, all good.

381
00:23:49,253 --> 00:23:51,093
Starting to bust my balls.

382
00:23:51,133 --> 00:23:52,173
He's alright.

383
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:55,693
Last time I saw him,
he was talking slick.

384
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:58,333
And the new fruit vendor.

385
00:23:58,373 --> 00:23:59,493
The new guy?

386
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:00,813
He's a softie.

387
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:01,653
Good.

388
00:24:02,053 --> 00:24:03,453
He'll get the Ballon d'Or.

389
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:06,373
The young Mbappé?

390
00:24:07,373 --> 00:24:09,253
No. Modric will get it.

391
00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:12,053
Not certain.

392
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,133
Mbappé...

393
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,493
He's in another galaxy.

394
00:24:17,853 --> 00:24:18,853
He's a mirage.

395
00:24:19,413 --> 00:24:20,893
See that, all fake.

396
00:24:21,773 --> 00:24:22,853
Knock-offs...

397
00:24:24,773 --> 00:24:26,773
- I can prove it's not.
- Real fake, then?

398
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:28,213
This one's not bad.

399
00:24:28,613 --> 00:24:30,053
Partial fake.

400
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,813
Half fake, half real?

401
00:24:31,853 --> 00:24:33,533
- I have invoices.
- Really?

402
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:34,733
How much?

403
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,253
35 euros.

404
00:24:36,293 --> 00:24:38,173
Word? Can I borrow money?

405
00:24:38,533 --> 00:24:40,333
You extended your stand?

406
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,133
Thanks, have a nice day.

407
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:45,373
How much? 9 yards?

408
00:24:47,773 --> 00:24:50,653
Come on ladies, take advantage.

409
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:52,613
Everything's on sale.

410
00:24:52,653 --> 00:24:54,053
Here's 22.

411
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:57,133
For real, an ice cream truck
would be great.

412
00:24:57,173 --> 00:24:58,733
Instant success.

413
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:02,653
For people here, not 5,
but 1-euro ice creams.

414
00:25:03,053 --> 00:25:04,293
Plus our tax.

415
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:07,413
Kids would like that.

416
00:25:07,773 --> 00:25:10,093
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

417
00:25:10,573 --> 00:25:11,613
Went well today?

418
00:25:11,653 --> 00:25:13,693
Aside from Amar acting out.

419
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:15,893
Gonna take care of that guy.

420
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:17,653
Let him act a fool.

421
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:20,733
- Alright, brothers.
- Peace.

422
00:25:22,453 --> 00:25:24,053
Look who's coming.

423
00:25:24,093 --> 00:25:27,933
Can't stand that ugly motherfucker.

424
00:25:28,853 --> 00:25:30,813
Mr Mayor, how are things?

425
00:25:30,853 --> 00:25:32,173
Not good, brother.

426
00:25:32,613 --> 00:25:36,293
If Amar keeps busting my balls,
gonna kick him out.

427
00:25:36,813 --> 00:25:37,693
What did he do?

428
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:41,053
I keep telling him.
He takes up too much room.

429
00:25:41,613 --> 00:25:42,733
Want me to talk to him?

430
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:45,453
Up to you.
Or I'll handle it my way.

431
00:25:45,493 --> 00:25:46,573
Handle what?

432
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:48,853
That's our job, not yours.

433
00:25:48,893 --> 00:25:50,373
Talk to him, please.

434
00:25:50,413 --> 00:25:53,093
Handle your detergent,
fake jerseys and watermelons.

435
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:55,093
Fall back.

436
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:56,933
Not gonna introduce us?

437
00:25:58,053 --> 00:25:59,933
- Introduce yourself.
- Gentlemen.

438
00:26:01,253 --> 00:26:02,053
Hello.

439
00:26:02,413 --> 00:26:03,973
Go on, don't be shy.

440
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,293
Hello.

441
00:26:06,373 --> 00:26:07,773
What's your name?

442
00:26:08,213 --> 00:26:09,533
Corporal Ruiz.

443
00:26:10,453 --> 00:26:12,533
- Nice to meet you, Ruiz.
- Pleasure.

444
00:26:13,533 --> 00:26:16,013
Don't look at me. He's talking to you.

445
00:26:16,053 --> 00:26:18,413
Leave the new guy alone.

446
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,413
He won't last long.

447
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:23,173
You checked for what I asked for?
That thing?

448
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:25,693
Seeing my cousin later.

449
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:27,453
I don't want fake shit.

450
00:26:27,493 --> 00:26:30,573
When did I ever give you fake shit?

451
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:32,893
In its original box. For my wife.

452
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:35,733
"Ever give you fake shit?"

453
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:37,013
Shut your trap!

454
00:26:37,253 --> 00:26:38,533
Have a nice day.

455
00:26:38,573 --> 00:26:39,533
Gentlemen.

456
00:26:40,413 --> 00:26:41,573
Red Power Ranger!

457
00:26:41,613 --> 00:26:42,933
Where are the others?

458
00:26:44,293 --> 00:26:46,173
That bum ass.

459
00:26:46,573 --> 00:26:48,733
Matter of time before I fuck'm up.

460
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,613
That's what he wants.
Don't fall for it.

461
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:55,333
Don't say that.
I'm just supposed to stand here?

462
00:26:55,373 --> 00:26:56,653
Who do you think I am?

463
00:26:58,053 --> 00:26:58,973
Seriously?

464
00:26:59,013 --> 00:27:00,693
He treats me like shit.

465
00:27:00,733 --> 00:27:02,693
You a career counselor now?

466
00:27:02,733 --> 00:27:04,293
Just do your job!

467
00:27:15,373 --> 00:27:16,533
Amar,

468
00:27:16,573 --> 00:27:17,533
my friend!

469
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,293
What's up?

470
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:25,453
You know what's up,
you're gonna lose your stand

471
00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:27,093
if you keep spreading out.

472
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:28,733
What are we gonna do?

473
00:27:29,453 --> 00:27:32,093
Like Miss France,
all I want is world peace.

474
00:27:32,533 --> 00:27:34,893
No beef. How can we solve this?

475
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:37,693
I pay for every inch,
this thug wants more.

476
00:27:38,093 --> 00:27:39,653
You know the drill.

477
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:41,893
I haven't even made 20,
he wants 50.

478
00:27:42,413 --> 00:27:43,493
Who's the crook?

479
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:44,853
<i>Fucking queers!</i>

480
00:27:44,893 --> 00:27:47,053
<i>Will bleed you to death!</i>

481
00:27:47,093 --> 00:27:48,013
<i>Give him back!</i>

482
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:51,133
<i>If not, gonna crucify you!</i>

483
00:27:51,173 --> 00:27:53,173
<i>Gonna crucify y'all faggots!</i>

484
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:55,413
Let's go.

485
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,133
This way.

486
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:00,373
<i>...cut your balls.</i>

487
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:02,533
<i>Break your legs, motherfuckers!</i>

488
00:28:03,013 --> 00:28:04,293
<i>Bitches!</i>

489
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:07,813
<i>Gonna burn your faggot hood!</i>

490
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:11,333
Whoever stole Johnny,
gonna eat shit

491
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:14,173
and the brain of its corpse.

492
00:28:14,213 --> 00:28:17,533
Something happens to him,
he doesn't come back

493
00:28:17,573 --> 00:28:19,533
we'll kill you, dead faggots!

494
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,693
Eat your brains!

495
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:22,813
Cut your balls off,
eat your ancestors.

496
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:24,493
Look around.

497
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:27,013
Put him in the truck first.

498
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:28,613
What does he look like?

499
00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:30,893
He had a black jersey.

500
00:28:31,173 --> 00:28:32,653
Can't see him anymore.

501
00:28:32,693 --> 00:28:34,213
They're all black here.

502
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:36,773
Spot him and I bust his head open!

503
00:28:36,813 --> 00:28:37,733
That isn't him?

504
00:28:37,773 --> 00:28:38,773
Nah.

505
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:40,773
All black in this shit hood.

506
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:43,053
Do a U-turn at the next block.

507
00:28:48,373 --> 00:28:50,293
Gypsies. Never a good sign.

508
00:28:56,573 --> 00:28:58,133
Wrong highway exit.

509
00:28:58,173 --> 00:29:00,533
Mayor, they look suspect.

510
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:01,533
What's going on?

511
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:08,373
Hey guys. What's up?

512
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,653
Yeah, all good.
Just gonna have a chat.

513
00:29:11,693 --> 00:29:13,253
Got a few questions.

514
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:15,813
What's with the sticks?

515
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:18,573
Gimme a sec.
I've come for my Johnny.

516
00:29:18,613 --> 00:29:20,413
What d'you mean, gypsy?

517
00:29:20,453 --> 00:29:21,933
Calm down, I'll explain.

518
00:29:21,973 --> 00:29:23,053
I'm calm, man.

519
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:26,413
They came to my circus
and swiped my Johnny.

520
00:29:26,453 --> 00:29:27,893
What you talking about?

521
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,213
Kidnapped my Johnny.

522
00:29:29,813 --> 00:29:31,293
They swiped him.

523
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,173
I bottle fed him. He like a son.

524
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:35,133
He's in the projects.

525
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:36,893
Look for him, here, there.

526
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:38,373
I don't get it.

527
00:29:38,413 --> 00:29:40,573
- Not here to start shit.
- Me neither.

528
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,093
Do I know your Johnny?

529
00:29:42,133 --> 00:29:43,253
Don't need to.

530
00:29:43,293 --> 00:29:44,773
But I don't know him!

531
00:29:44,813 --> 00:29:46,333
Gonna fuck them up!

532
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:48,253
Burn them to a crisp!

533
00:29:48,293 --> 00:29:50,093
Calm down, gypsy!

534
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:50,893
Find him!

535
00:29:50,933 --> 00:29:52,653
- You know him?
- The singer?

536
00:29:52,693 --> 00:29:53,493
He's dead.

537
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:55,493
One of your guys took him.

538
00:29:55,733 --> 00:29:57,333
You know Johnny?

539
00:29:58,093 --> 00:29:59,253
It's him!

540
00:29:59,293 --> 00:30:01,813
It's you!

541
00:30:01,853 --> 00:30:03,533
Who? I'ma fuck you up.

542
00:30:03,573 --> 00:30:04,933
Go for it.

543
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:09,093
You're gonna find him!

544
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,573
Where are the Gypsy Kings?

545
00:30:13,653 --> 00:30:15,213
There, on the left.

546
00:30:15,693 --> 00:30:16,973
Do a U-turn.

547
00:30:18,013 --> 00:30:19,133
Well done, Greaser.

548
00:30:27,813 --> 00:30:29,493
We need backup.

549
00:30:29,533 --> 00:30:30,813
We'll handle it.

550
00:30:30,853 --> 00:30:31,733
Calm down.

551
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:36,493
What's happening?

552
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:38,413
Back up. Back up!

553
00:30:38,453 --> 00:30:40,493
Back up. Back up!

554
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:47,133
Calm down!
What's going on?

555
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:49,253
Good you're here.

556
00:30:49,293 --> 00:30:51,213
You're gonna settle the score.

557
00:30:51,253 --> 00:30:53,373
- Calm down.
- They swiped my Johnny.

558
00:30:54,133 --> 00:30:55,733
They came and stole him.

559
00:30:55,773 --> 00:30:58,453
They kidnapped one of your guys?

560
00:30:59,653 --> 00:31:01,213
Johnny's my lion cub.

561
00:31:03,013 --> 00:31:04,533
I want him back.

562
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:06,813
Someone stole a lion?

563
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,333
They stole my lion cub.

564
00:31:10,373 --> 00:31:12,853
Who saw what?
You saw something?

565
00:31:12,893 --> 00:31:15,133
He saw. Come here Chino.

566
00:31:15,613 --> 00:31:17,973
A little nigga took the lion
to the projects!

567
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:20,133
I'll make him fuck his ancestors!

568
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:21,773
I'll cut off his legs!

569
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,213
- What?
- Calm down.

570
00:31:23,253 --> 00:31:24,533
- You saw him?
- Yeah.

571
00:31:24,573 --> 00:31:25,373
A lil' nigga.

572
00:31:25,693 --> 00:31:27,173
I got it!

573
00:31:27,213 --> 00:31:28,373
Black jersey.

574
00:31:28,413 --> 00:31:29,173
Calm down!

575
00:31:29,213 --> 00:31:30,253
He crazy?

576
00:31:30,693 --> 00:31:31,453
Mayor.

577
00:31:31,493 --> 00:31:33,693
You got 24 hours to find him.

578
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:35,893
Or I'll be back with a shotgun.

579
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:37,813
- You old cunt!
- Shut up!

580
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:39,693
Step back, step back.

581
00:31:45,573 --> 00:31:46,653
Get back.

582
00:31:49,053 --> 00:31:50,533
Son of a bitch.

583
00:31:55,253 --> 00:31:56,453
Step away!

584
00:31:58,653 --> 00:32:01,413
Zorro, take your boys and go.

585
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,293
Let's go.

586
00:32:03,893 --> 00:32:04,893
Slut!

587
00:32:06,973 --> 00:32:07,853
All good.

588
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:09,173
We'll bring him back.

589
00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:10,893
We'll find him.

590
00:32:12,613 --> 00:32:13,733
Man up, pussy!

591
00:32:14,093 --> 00:32:16,213
I'll take care of it. Go now.

592
00:32:19,413 --> 00:32:20,493
Motherfucker!

593
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:21,373
Let them bark.

594
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:23,173
You serious?

595
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:25,253
Our parents are watching.

596
00:32:25,293 --> 00:32:27,853
- You crazy?
- Let's go into your office.

597
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:30,613
Thought it was his son, not a lion!

598
00:32:30,653 --> 00:32:33,693
Some real drama.
You fucking serious?

599
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:35,013
What's up with that?

600
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,733
If they come back,

601
00:32:36,773 --> 00:32:39,133
bullets will fly.

602
00:32:39,173 --> 00:32:40,213
You hear me?

603
00:32:40,253 --> 00:32:42,853
I'll take care of them. Calm down.

604
00:32:42,893 --> 00:32:44,293
Now, do me a favor.

605
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:46,253
Scope around and find the lion.

606
00:32:46,293 --> 00:32:48,533
- What do I get out of it?
- What do you get?

607
00:32:48,573 --> 00:32:51,493
Them not returning, guns blazing.

608
00:32:51,533 --> 00:32:53,213
Mothers mourning.

609
00:32:53,253 --> 00:32:54,533
Bullshit.

610
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,693
Control the kids. It's your job!

611
00:32:56,733 --> 00:32:57,893
Shut your mouth.

612
00:32:57,933 --> 00:32:59,053
You threatening me?

613
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:00,733
C'mon, calm down.

614
00:33:00,773 --> 00:33:02,213
Shut the fuck up.

615
00:33:02,253 --> 00:33:03,733
- Calm down.
- Asshole.

616
00:33:05,213 --> 00:33:06,373
No fucks given.

617
00:33:06,413 --> 00:33:08,733
Seriously, I don't give a fuck.

618
00:33:08,773 --> 00:33:10,413
They can come back.

619
00:33:10,453 --> 00:33:12,773
Burn down the block. I don't care.

620
00:33:12,813 --> 00:33:15,533
City hall will pay me
to calm the kids.

621
00:33:15,573 --> 00:33:16,493
Cry me a river.

622
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:17,733
Knock it off!

623
00:33:17,773 --> 00:33:19,373
'The fuck you talking about?

624
00:33:20,053 --> 00:33:20,853
Seriously.

625
00:33:21,373 --> 00:33:22,653
Do as I say.

626
00:33:26,053 --> 00:33:27,373
Alright, you got it.

627
00:33:27,853 --> 00:33:28,773
Only cuz it's you.

628
00:33:29,213 --> 00:33:30,373
Counting on you.

629
00:33:30,773 --> 00:33:31,533
We're out.

630
00:33:31,573 --> 00:33:32,773
Bozo.

631
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:35,973
What do you want?
What you looking at?

632
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:36,853
Wanna suck it?

633
00:33:36,893 --> 00:33:37,813
Beat it!

634
00:33:37,853 --> 00:33:39,733
Ladies, enjoy your day.

635
00:33:40,293 --> 00:33:41,413
Asshole.

636
00:33:44,933 --> 00:33:45,973
Mayor.

637
00:33:46,013 --> 00:33:47,293
Macha.

638
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:48,733
See how they treat us?

639
00:33:48,773 --> 00:33:49,933
Too confident.

640
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:51,613
It's over.

641
00:33:51,653 --> 00:33:53,573
They need us
more than we need them.

642
00:33:54,573 --> 00:33:56,533
Fuck their stupid lion.

643
00:34:00,453 --> 00:34:01,613
We're not animal control.

644
00:34:01,653 --> 00:34:02,733
Who cares?

645
00:34:03,253 --> 00:34:04,893
Tase him and it's a done deal.

646
00:34:05,533 --> 00:34:07,053
So where do we start?

647
00:34:08,373 --> 00:34:10,893
Start with Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat.

648
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:13,413
Why?

649
00:34:13,813 --> 00:34:15,213
They're dummies.

650
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,933
They can't help bragging
on social media.

651
00:34:27,893 --> 00:34:28,973
Greaser!

652
00:34:29,253 --> 00:34:30,453
Quit wanking.

653
00:34:30,733 --> 00:34:31,533
You shy?

654
00:34:32,893 --> 00:34:33,693
Not really.

655
00:34:35,053 --> 00:34:36,053
First mission.

656
00:34:36,573 --> 00:34:37,973
You walk in there.

657
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:40,733
Greet everyone politely,

658
00:34:41,093 --> 00:34:42,573
and ask for Salah.

659
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,133
Okay?

660
00:34:44,173 --> 00:34:46,253
He knows everything and everyone.

661
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:48,453
See if he saw a kid with a mini-lion.

662
00:34:49,893 --> 00:34:50,973
Get it Greaser?

663
00:34:52,453 --> 00:34:53,853
They won't bite.

664
00:35:05,533 --> 00:35:06,853
His armband.

665
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:24,413
Gentlemen.

666
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,453
I was hoping to speak to Salah.

667
00:35:30,693 --> 00:35:31,653
Is he around?

668
00:35:36,253 --> 00:35:37,093
Anyone?

669
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:45,253
Hello.

670
00:35:48,653 --> 00:35:49,813
My colleagues...

671
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:57,773
They thought you could help us
regarding a theft.

672
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,973
What information
are your colleagues seeking?

673
00:36:06,613 --> 00:36:09,733
A lion cub was stolen from a circus.

674
00:36:09,773 --> 00:36:12,293
The circus owners...

675
00:36:12,733 --> 00:36:14,373
want to get it back.

676
00:36:15,853 --> 00:36:19,133
They suspect a local kid,
an individual of African descent.

677
00:36:24,613 --> 00:36:26,653
Maybe you, or someone here

678
00:36:27,613 --> 00:36:29,213
heard or saw

679
00:36:29,493 --> 00:36:31,533
something related to the lion.

680
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:39,053
Does a lion belong in a circus?

681
00:36:41,293 --> 00:36:43,813
In Islam, this majestic animal

682
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:45,693
embodies force and power.

683
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:48,853
Man shouldn't cage such a wise creature.

684
00:36:52,973 --> 00:36:54,373
Agreed but...

685
00:36:56,653 --> 00:36:59,373
It'd be best to return it to its owner.

686
00:36:59,413 --> 00:37:01,333
A lion cub is vulnerable.

687
00:37:01,613 --> 00:37:03,733
It needs to be cared for and fed.

688
00:37:03,773 --> 00:37:06,053
Since when do men need to feed lions?

689
00:37:06,093 --> 00:37:07,813
Don't they hunt on their own?

690
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:08,853
Feed themselves?

691
00:37:10,173 --> 00:37:12,573
Men create unnatural constraints.

692
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:14,773
That is servitude.

693
00:37:16,453 --> 00:37:18,613
What does a lion say when it roars?

694
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:22,373
O Allah!

695
00:37:23,933 --> 00:37:27,053
May he who is benevolent
be protected from my claws.

696
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,373
Eat in peace.

697
00:37:42,613 --> 00:37:44,093
On the house.

698
00:38:10,653 --> 00:38:11,813
Greaser.

699
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:16,013
So?

700
00:38:16,373 --> 00:38:17,533
Very funny.

701
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:20,653
So I got a free kebab.

702
00:38:24,973 --> 00:38:26,133
Who's Salah?

703
00:38:26,693 --> 00:38:29,893
An ex-thug who grew a beard.
He calls the shots.

704
00:38:30,533 --> 00:38:32,373
We got a lot of dirt on him.

705
00:38:32,413 --> 00:38:33,893
He was a big fish.

706
00:38:36,133 --> 00:38:37,333
You learn anything?

707
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:39,893
Absolutely nothing.

708
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:46,733
Issa, what you doing here?

709
00:38:48,533 --> 00:38:49,613
What's that?

710
00:38:50,093 --> 00:38:52,133
Your dad doesn't want you
to come home.

711
00:38:52,813 --> 00:38:54,133
Where you gonna go?

712
00:38:56,973 --> 00:38:58,253
What did Mom say?

713
00:38:58,293 --> 00:39:00,213
She's tired of arguing with him.

714
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,853
She wants you to come home.

715
00:39:02,893 --> 00:39:03,893
Really?

716
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:04,933
Yeah.

717
00:39:05,973 --> 00:39:07,133
What's in there?

718
00:39:09,693 --> 00:39:12,493
You crazy! Don't bring that back home!

719
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:14,013
I'm talking to you.

720
00:39:14,053 --> 00:39:14,973
Issa!

721
00:39:17,533 --> 00:39:18,853
Is he aggressive?

722
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:19,893
Can I pat him?

723
00:39:20,413 --> 00:39:21,933
Aw, so cute.

724
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,853
Let me take a picture.

725
00:39:23,893 --> 00:39:26,373
Hurry, before he wriggles.

726
00:39:31,133 --> 00:39:32,893
Let's go.

727
00:39:32,933 --> 00:39:34,413
What you gonna do with him?

728
00:39:34,453 --> 00:39:35,253
Come.

729
00:39:49,733 --> 00:39:51,733
Let's check with the kids from B5,

730
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,373
maybe they got intel.

731
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:56,733
SCU style, Greaser.

732
00:40:00,413 --> 00:40:01,413
Slow down.

733
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:04,733
Here they are.

734
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:12,813
Watch out! Cops!

735
00:40:12,853 --> 00:40:14,373
Stop! Where you going?

736
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,093
Don't move!

737
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:18,253
Where you going?

738
00:40:19,453 --> 00:40:20,413
Why you running?

739
00:40:20,453 --> 00:40:22,413
Gents, hands out your pockets.

740
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,013
Are my hands in my pockets?

741
00:40:25,053 --> 00:40:26,133
I'm talking to you.

742
00:40:26,933 --> 00:40:28,173
Come on, hurry up!

743
00:40:30,813 --> 00:40:32,533
Blondie, stay there.

744
00:40:32,573 --> 00:40:33,613
Why you running?

745
00:40:33,653 --> 00:40:34,613
Don't move.

746
00:40:34,653 --> 00:40:36,293
Greaser, watch him.

747
00:40:37,173 --> 00:40:38,733
Hello, police check.

748
00:40:38,973 --> 00:40:41,253
I'm going to frisk you now.

749
00:40:41,293 --> 00:40:42,813
Any sharp items on you?

750
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:45,253
Any illicit items?

751
00:40:45,533 --> 00:40:46,893
- I'm talking to you!
- No.

752
00:40:46,933 --> 00:40:48,293
Glad to hear you.

753
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:49,373
Are we done?

754
00:40:49,693 --> 00:40:52,493
Was I disrespectful to you? No.

755
00:40:54,013 --> 00:40:55,693
Lots of lighters.

756
00:40:58,613 --> 00:40:59,893
This yours?

757
00:40:59,933 --> 00:41:00,693
Yeah.

758
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:02,013
You pay for the bus?

759
00:41:05,293 --> 00:41:07,893
I'm not done frisking, stand still!

760
00:41:08,653 --> 00:41:10,013
Where's the lion?

761
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:11,493
What lion?

762
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:13,453
We need it back. Where is it?

763
00:41:13,493 --> 00:41:14,413
No lion.

764
00:41:14,453 --> 00:41:15,573
Go fuck yourself!

765
00:41:16,013 --> 00:41:17,573
Down a notch.

766
00:41:18,413 --> 00:41:20,933
- What did you say?
- Fuck yourself!

767
00:41:21,413 --> 00:41:24,253
You're only fifteen so shut the fuck up!

768
00:41:25,893 --> 00:41:26,933
What's happening?

769
00:41:27,413 --> 00:41:29,413
What's wrong with you?

770
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:31,893
Get back in here! I already told you!

771
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:34,013
- Sorry.
- Sorry for what?

772
00:41:34,053 --> 00:41:36,493
- Harassing us every day?
- Sorry.

773
00:41:36,533 --> 00:41:38,693
Enough, down a notch!

774
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:39,813
This is my home!

775
00:41:39,853 --> 00:41:41,053
Let's go.

776
00:41:41,093 --> 00:41:43,053
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Not accepted.

777
00:41:43,093 --> 00:41:44,493
You out of your mind?

778
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:47,933
You harass our kids and apologize?

779
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:49,653
He shouldn't run when he sees us.

780
00:41:49,693 --> 00:41:51,333
Why hit him?

781
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:53,013
Why?

782
00:41:56,133 --> 00:41:57,013
Congrats.

783
00:41:57,053 --> 00:41:59,093
You get told off and apologize.

784
00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:01,333
You in customer service?

785
00:42:01,373 --> 00:42:02,653
Can't we be polite?

786
00:42:02,693 --> 00:42:05,373
Then work as a butler in a palace.

787
00:42:05,813 --> 00:42:07,573
Any luster or gildings here?

788
00:42:07,853 --> 00:42:09,413
Never sorry, always right.

789
00:42:09,453 --> 00:42:12,413
Take that dumb armband off.
It's obvious we're cops.

790
00:42:29,133 --> 00:42:30,053
Got him!

791
00:42:32,533 --> 00:42:33,613
From this morning.

792
00:42:34,573 --> 00:42:35,853
Little Issa.

793
00:42:36,653 --> 00:42:38,093
Bingo. Let's go!

794
00:43:06,093 --> 00:43:07,333
Police!

795
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:09,853
Open up, ma'am.

796
00:43:12,253 --> 00:43:13,173
What do you want?

797
00:43:13,213 --> 00:43:14,693
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello, sir.

798
00:43:14,733 --> 00:43:16,093
- Looking for Issa.
- Not here.

799
00:43:16,653 --> 00:43:18,413
- Where is he?
- Out and about.

800
00:43:18,453 --> 00:43:20,173
- Where?
- I don't know.

801
00:43:20,573 --> 00:43:22,053
Don't you monitor him?

802
00:43:22,093 --> 00:43:24,213
Sir, Issa is not here.

803
00:43:25,213 --> 00:43:25,973
Stop!

804
00:43:26,013 --> 00:43:27,493
Let me look inside.

805
00:43:27,533 --> 00:43:29,613
Stop or I'll call the real police.

806
00:43:29,653 --> 00:43:31,773
I am the real police, ma'am.

807
00:43:31,813 --> 00:43:33,493
You need a search warrant.

808
00:43:33,533 --> 00:43:34,773
I don't need one.

809
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:36,813
I know my rights. You do.

810
00:43:36,853 --> 00:43:38,773
Where's your husband?

811
00:43:38,813 --> 00:43:39,693
He's not here.

812
00:43:39,733 --> 00:43:42,053
He was at the precinct this morning.

813
00:43:42,093 --> 00:43:43,413
No warrant, no access.

814
00:43:43,453 --> 00:43:45,173
I got this... Ma'am.

815
00:43:45,453 --> 00:43:47,373
Last time Issa misbehaved,

816
00:43:47,413 --> 00:43:50,453
the judge issued a warrant, remember?

817
00:43:50,493 --> 00:43:52,813
We searched your home
for two hours.

818
00:43:53,293 --> 00:43:55,013
Want to do that again?

819
00:43:55,053 --> 00:43:55,853
We agree?

820
00:43:55,973 --> 00:43:59,573
Let us in.
If Issa's not here, we leave.

821
00:44:03,093 --> 00:44:05,573
I don't understand.
Speak French, ma'am.

822
00:44:05,613 --> 00:44:08,533
What is she saying?
I don't understand.

823
00:44:10,493 --> 00:44:11,733
Okay. I'll be back.

824
00:44:18,093 --> 00:44:19,293
Damn.

825
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:22,173
No clue where her kid is.
She won't let us in.

826
00:44:22,533 --> 00:44:24,613
She's right.
We don't have a warrant.

827
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:27,093
You'll never be SCU at heart.

828
00:44:27,773 --> 00:44:30,133
Because I don't act like a cowboy?

829
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:33,253
You don't get it. It's not an act.

830
00:44:37,613 --> 00:44:39,293
- Hello kids.
- Hello.

831
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:40,773
Where's Issa?

832
00:44:40,813 --> 00:44:42,053
Dunno.

833
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:43,453
- Really?
- Yes.

834
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:46,333
Hi real cop.

835
00:44:46,373 --> 00:44:48,933
That's my other son Issaka, not Issa.

836
00:44:48,973 --> 00:44:51,173
Okay. Can I check?

837
00:44:51,213 --> 00:44:52,373
Yes, you can.

838
00:45:05,493 --> 00:45:07,213
We all take turns.

839
00:45:08,613 --> 00:45:09,693
It's our tontine.

840
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:13,973
- Apologies.
- You're welcome.

841
00:45:15,093 --> 00:45:17,133
- Goodbye.
- Thanks, bye.

842
00:45:17,693 --> 00:45:20,013
Ma'am, don't let your son stray...

843
00:45:20,053 --> 00:45:21,693
Or he'll sail away.

844
00:45:21,733 --> 00:45:22,773
Can't come in.

845
00:45:23,733 --> 00:45:25,093
What were they doing?

846
00:45:25,733 --> 00:45:28,693
A tontine,
a way to borrow without interest.

847
00:45:28,733 --> 00:45:31,013
Everyone pools money,

848
00:45:31,053 --> 00:45:33,853
and one person takes it
for a major expense,

849
00:45:33,893 --> 00:45:35,733
like paying for a wedding

850
00:45:36,253 --> 00:45:38,693
or a trip back home to see family.

851
00:45:40,173 --> 00:45:41,613
Let's check the soccer field.

852
00:45:47,773 --> 00:45:48,653
Issa!

853
00:45:52,253 --> 00:45:53,213
He's there.

854
00:45:53,693 --> 00:45:55,213
Green pants, grey shirt.

855
00:45:56,293 --> 00:45:57,653
Let's cuff him and jet.

856
00:46:14,853 --> 00:46:15,933
Come here!

857
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:20,413
We did nothing.

858
00:46:28,893 --> 00:46:30,013
Get back!

859
00:46:33,893 --> 00:46:35,293
Rascals!

860
00:46:35,773 --> 00:46:37,093
Get out of here!

861
00:46:38,453 --> 00:46:39,213
Let go!

862
00:46:39,253 --> 00:46:40,373
Give me your hand.

863
00:46:40,893 --> 00:46:41,773
Scram!

864
00:46:41,813 --> 00:46:43,333
Beat it, rascals.

865
00:46:48,413 --> 00:46:49,653
Run, run!

866
00:46:51,173 --> 00:46:52,413
Get away, Issa.

867
00:46:54,413 --> 00:46:55,653
Get back here!

868
00:47:01,973 --> 00:47:03,613
Go home, fool.

869
00:47:04,933 --> 00:47:06,253
Stop right there!

870
00:47:19,573 --> 00:47:20,733
Fuck!

871
00:47:46,493 --> 00:47:47,493
Stop!

872
00:47:48,253 --> 00:47:49,373
Don't move!

873
00:47:49,693 --> 00:47:51,533
On the ground. Hands up!

874
00:47:51,573 --> 00:47:53,853
Making me run? Lil' fag!

875
00:47:53,893 --> 00:47:54,813
Fuck!

876
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:57,493
Where's the lion?

877
00:47:57,533 --> 00:47:58,773
In the basement.

878
00:47:58,813 --> 00:47:59,853
Which one?

879
00:47:59,893 --> 00:48:00,853
It ran away.

880
00:48:00,893 --> 00:48:03,133
Shitbird! Don't mess with me.

881
00:48:03,173 --> 00:48:05,093
- Where is it?
- It ran away.

882
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:06,573
Where did it go?

883
00:48:06,613 --> 00:48:07,973
Where is it?

884
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:08,973
Let me go.

885
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,933
Get up! Shitbird!

886
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:13,173
Back up!

887
00:48:13,213 --> 00:48:14,773
Greaser!
Take care of him.

888
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:16,893
Come here.

889
00:48:18,613 --> 00:48:19,453
Scram.

890
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,493
Let him go! He did nothing!

891
00:48:30,373 --> 00:48:31,573
Beat it, faggot!

892
00:48:33,053 --> 00:48:34,093
Get outta here!

893
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,213
Move!

894
00:48:35,253 --> 00:48:36,453
Get away!

895
00:48:38,813 --> 00:48:39,733
Scram!

896
00:48:41,773 --> 00:48:42,733
Let him go!

897
00:48:43,573 --> 00:48:45,453
Move or I'll shoot!

898
00:49:25,853 --> 00:49:26,653
Don't move!

899
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:43,533
Give it!

900
00:49:46,053 --> 00:49:46,853
Fuck...

901
00:50:06,053 --> 00:50:06,933
Fuck!

902
00:50:06,973 --> 00:50:08,213
It's filming us!

903
00:50:19,973 --> 00:50:21,133
Fuck!

904
00:50:25,173 --> 00:50:27,173
What do we do? Fuck!

905
00:50:27,893 --> 00:50:29,093
He's still breathing.

906
00:50:30,373 --> 00:50:31,333
What you doing?

907
00:50:31,373 --> 00:50:32,173
Calling help.

908
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:35,373
You stupid?
And tell'm what? We shot a kid?

909
00:50:39,053 --> 00:50:40,493
He needs to go to the ER.

910
00:50:40,533 --> 00:50:42,733
Him later. First, the drone.

911
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:46,213
The drone?
The kid's unconscious!

912
00:50:46,253 --> 00:50:48,173
Gwada, me,

913
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:49,733
you, the team.

914
00:50:50,373 --> 00:50:51,533
That's the priority.

915
00:50:51,573 --> 00:50:53,573
If the video gets out, we're done!

916
00:50:53,613 --> 00:50:55,813
Now do what I say. Let's go!

917
00:50:59,933 --> 00:51:01,333
Get in the car!

918
00:51:27,773 --> 00:51:28,773
Fuck...

919
00:51:40,253 --> 00:51:41,973
We're really messing up here.

920
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:47,533
I'm talking to you, fool!

921
00:51:57,693 --> 00:51:59,213
The cops screwed up.

922
00:51:59,653 --> 00:52:02,013
Pink Pig and his unit.

923
00:52:02,053 --> 00:52:03,413
What now?

924
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,213
We were playing soccer

925
00:52:05,253 --> 00:52:07,093
and they grabbed Issa.

926
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:10,013
I don't care if they got Issa.

927
00:52:10,053 --> 00:52:11,893
He always fucking up.

928
00:52:11,933 --> 00:52:13,173
He did nothing.

929
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,733
Right, always innocent.

930
00:52:14,773 --> 00:52:15,573
Now, scram.

931
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,133
Beat it.

932
00:52:17,173 --> 00:52:18,733
They flash-balled him.

933
00:52:18,773 --> 00:52:19,733
He might be dead.

934
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:20,893
You serious?

935
00:52:21,453 --> 00:52:22,853
- Who was there?
- Us.

936
00:52:22,893 --> 00:52:24,573
A drone filmed it all.

937
00:52:25,693 --> 00:52:27,653
- A drone?
- Yup. Filmed it all.

938
00:52:27,933 --> 00:52:29,093
You sure about that?

939
00:52:29,653 --> 00:52:31,133
You know who was filming?

940
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:33,653
Is that the truth?

941
00:52:34,613 --> 00:52:35,973
Step into the office.

942
00:52:37,933 --> 00:52:39,093
You hungry?

943
00:52:39,133 --> 00:52:39,933
Yup.

944
00:52:50,013 --> 00:52:51,133
Greaser.

945
00:52:51,173 --> 00:52:53,453
Watch him. We'll be back in five.

946
00:53:05,493 --> 00:53:06,733
Is Stingy in?

947
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:15,653
Where is he?

948
00:53:16,533 --> 00:53:18,653
In the back. I'll go get him.

949
00:53:30,453 --> 00:53:31,893
Chris is here.

950
00:53:31,933 --> 00:53:33,493
With his partners.

951
00:53:44,013 --> 00:53:46,373
Bruh, what's with the screw face?

952
00:53:46,413 --> 00:53:47,693
What's up?

953
00:53:48,573 --> 00:53:49,693
Got a situation.

954
00:53:49,733 --> 00:53:50,813
What happened?

955
00:53:51,733 --> 00:53:53,293
What situation?

956
00:53:54,853 --> 00:53:56,853
- Can we talk here?
- Shoot.

957
00:53:57,693 --> 00:53:59,373
Our last patrol turned sour.

958
00:54:00,093 --> 00:54:01,413
Kids kept pushing us.

959
00:54:01,453 --> 00:54:03,813
A kid got flash-balled in the face.

960
00:54:03,853 --> 00:54:05,533
Bro, that's bad news.

961
00:54:05,573 --> 00:54:07,213
Y'all fucked up, which kid?

962
00:54:07,253 --> 00:54:08,213
Little Issa.

963
00:54:08,253 --> 00:54:09,493
Is he okay?

964
00:54:09,733 --> 00:54:12,093
He's a bit asleep. He'll be okay.

965
00:54:12,973 --> 00:54:15,813
That's not the issue.
A drone filmed us.

966
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,973
You know who has one?

967
00:54:18,013 --> 00:54:19,893
I have no idea.

968
00:54:19,933 --> 00:54:22,533
I need that video or I'm in deep shit.

969
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,173
Make some calls.

970
00:54:24,493 --> 00:54:26,373
- Gotta find him.
- On it.

971
00:54:26,653 --> 00:54:27,613
Go for it.

972
00:55:07,013 --> 00:55:08,173
So?

973
00:55:09,053 --> 00:55:10,093
He's not there.

974
00:55:12,093 --> 00:55:13,853
Where does Buzz hang out?

975
00:55:14,413 --> 00:55:16,333
No idea.
Either the pit...

976
00:55:16,373 --> 00:55:17,813
or the soccer field.

977
00:55:17,853 --> 00:55:19,053
Gotta go check.

978
00:55:19,493 --> 00:55:21,853
Tell our guys to spot the SCU's car.

979
00:55:22,213 --> 00:55:23,693
It's a grey Peugeot.

980
00:55:23,733 --> 00:55:25,133
Trail them.

981
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,373
Gotta straighten you up.

982
00:55:56,813 --> 00:55:57,893
Sorry.

983
00:55:57,933 --> 00:55:59,373
Hold on. Upright.

984
00:56:01,933 --> 00:56:03,173
Little forward.

985
00:56:03,213 --> 00:56:05,773
Sorry, I can't uncuff you.
Need the keys.

986
00:56:07,253 --> 00:56:08,333
It's gonna be okay.

987
00:56:09,173 --> 00:56:10,173
Can you hear me?

988
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:15,373
Stay still.

989
00:56:18,653 --> 00:56:19,933
Just relax.

990
00:56:19,973 --> 00:56:21,053
You'll be okay.

991
00:56:24,573 --> 00:56:25,533
I know...

992
00:56:32,133 --> 00:56:33,253
Fuck.

993
00:56:47,013 --> 00:56:48,093
Where were you?

994
00:56:51,253 --> 00:56:52,453
At the pharmacy.

995
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:54,813
How is he? He wake up?

996
00:56:54,853 --> 00:56:57,093
Yeah. Still faint. Uncuff him.

997
00:56:57,133 --> 00:56:58,693
Got a tip on the drone.

998
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:00,453
Uncuff him.

999
00:57:09,533 --> 00:57:10,813
What you doing?

1000
00:57:10,853 --> 00:57:12,173
- He stays here.
- What?

1001
00:57:12,213 --> 00:57:13,333
He stays here.

1002
00:57:13,373 --> 00:57:14,333
With them?

1003
00:57:15,013 --> 00:57:15,973
Let's go.

1004
00:57:18,133 --> 00:57:19,573
He must go to the ER.

1005
00:57:19,613 --> 00:57:21,533
Not gonna lug him around.
Hop in.

1006
00:57:22,013 --> 00:57:23,773
He's safe here.

1007
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:37,653
Don't move!

1008
00:57:38,253 --> 00:57:39,053
Stay there!

1009
00:57:39,413 --> 00:57:40,453
Don't move!

1010
00:57:41,093 --> 00:57:42,133
Open the door!

1011
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:45,413
Grab the drone. Meet downstairs.

1012
00:58:08,613 --> 00:58:10,253
The memory card's gone.

1013
00:58:12,653 --> 00:58:13,973
He's got the card.

1014
00:58:14,013 --> 00:58:15,693
Hear me? Don't lose him.

1015
00:58:41,653 --> 00:58:43,373
I lost the shitbird.

1016
00:58:44,413 --> 00:58:45,493
Meet at the shops.

1017
00:58:48,933 --> 00:58:51,173
He didn't just vanish...

1018
00:58:53,373 --> 00:58:55,093
He must've cut through B11.

1019
00:59:04,013 --> 00:59:06,173
Is the kid safe with those guys?

1020
00:59:06,613 --> 00:59:07,733
Don't worry.

1021
00:59:30,413 --> 00:59:31,613
Is Salah here?

1022
00:59:31,973 --> 00:59:33,333
Salah?

1023
00:59:33,373 --> 00:59:34,693
A kid wants to see you.

1024
00:59:36,453 --> 00:59:37,613
I'm in trouble.

1025
00:59:37,653 --> 00:59:39,613
Cops looking for me. Help me.

1026
00:59:39,653 --> 00:59:40,693
What happened?

1027
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:44,413
Take a deep breath.

1028
00:59:44,813 --> 00:59:46,173
Come, sit down.

1029
00:59:48,653 --> 00:59:49,893
Calm down.

1030
00:59:55,853 --> 00:59:56,693
Hello?

1031
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:00,733
What?

1032
01:00:03,053 --> 01:00:03,933
Right.

1033
01:00:03,973 --> 01:00:05,213
What's up?

1034
01:00:05,253 --> 01:00:06,933
They find the kid? It's good?

1035
01:00:07,493 --> 01:00:08,853
He went to Salah's.

1036
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,213
Not him. Goddamn!

1037
01:00:12,253 --> 01:00:13,533
Let's go.

1038
01:00:14,813 --> 01:00:15,933
Fucking hell.

1039
01:00:15,973 --> 01:00:17,493
Him of all people.

1040
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:24,613
He can't be far.

1041
01:00:28,093 --> 01:00:29,093
Why are they here?

1042
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:35,053
The kid's there. Let's go!

1043
01:00:35,093 --> 01:00:36,533
- Let's go!
- Wait.

1044
01:00:36,573 --> 01:00:38,773
For what? He's there.

1045
01:00:38,813 --> 01:00:41,173
Calling Stingy. How else will we get it?

1046
01:00:44,013 --> 01:00:46,053
This is gonna cost us a lot.

1047
01:00:54,253 --> 01:00:55,333
Buzz.

1048
01:00:55,373 --> 01:00:56,693
Alright bro?

1049
01:00:59,973 --> 01:01:02,093
You got something I want.

1050
01:01:04,773 --> 01:01:07,373
We could ruin the SCU with that video.

1051
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:12,533
Don't worry.

1052
01:01:31,053 --> 01:01:33,733
If we're clever, we can blackmail them.

1053
01:01:34,773 --> 01:01:38,173
And get whatever we want
from these assholes.

1054
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:43,213
Dark thoughts as always.

1055
01:01:47,653 --> 01:01:48,893
Watch it, Salah.

1056
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:51,653
Don't try to play me.

1057
01:01:52,813 --> 01:01:54,893
I could really ruin your life.

1058
01:01:58,533 --> 01:02:00,653
A dog barks when he can't bite.

1059
01:02:00,693 --> 01:02:02,253
Phony wiseman.

1060
01:02:02,293 --> 01:02:04,013
Just give us the video.

1061
01:02:04,693 --> 01:02:05,533
Salah,

1062
01:02:06,253 --> 01:02:07,973
we're here to make things right.

1063
01:02:08,013 --> 01:02:10,653
I don't want that to happen
to my little brother.

1064
01:02:11,493 --> 01:02:13,133
They all know us here.

1065
01:02:15,933 --> 01:02:18,653
We're good people.
Right, Buzz? Tell him.

1066
01:02:32,533 --> 01:02:33,973
- You good?
- You?

1067
01:02:34,013 --> 01:02:35,293
Let's cut to the chase.

1068
01:02:35,613 --> 01:02:36,773
What do you want?

1069
01:02:37,373 --> 01:02:39,253
What do you need? A hookup?

1070
01:02:40,733 --> 01:02:43,093
This doesn't even concern you.

1071
01:02:43,653 --> 01:02:46,373
Give the video to Chris,
and we're all happy.

1072
01:02:46,413 --> 01:02:47,853
That's why you're here?

1073
01:02:48,133 --> 01:02:49,533
Business as usual?

1074
01:02:49,573 --> 01:02:50,373
What you think?

1075
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,733
You brainwash these kids.

1076
01:02:53,133 --> 01:02:55,773
It'll start a riot.
Bad for business.

1077
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:56,813
What do you want?

1078
01:02:57,373 --> 01:02:58,773
Go sell your poison.

1079
01:02:58,813 --> 01:03:00,733
That's what you call it now?

1080
01:03:01,253 --> 01:03:04,453
Pretend to be an Imam.
I know your true colors.

1081
01:03:04,733 --> 01:03:06,933
Robin Hood, my ass.

1082
01:03:07,373 --> 01:03:09,613
Brothers not here to eat,

1083
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,093
I suggest you leave.

1084
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:18,053
Lost cause.

1085
01:03:24,093 --> 01:03:25,453
Who d'you think you are?

1086
01:03:26,933 --> 01:03:28,293
The new sheriff in town?

1087
01:03:29,573 --> 01:03:32,013
One call and you're a terror suspect.

1088
01:03:32,493 --> 01:03:34,133
This shit eatery folds.

1089
01:03:35,533 --> 01:03:37,613
Your dead-end mosque for retards.

1090
01:03:38,093 --> 01:03:38,893
Finished.

1091
01:03:39,853 --> 01:03:41,333
I'll arrest you tomorrow,

1092
01:03:41,813 --> 01:03:44,653
in front of your wife and kid. Get it?

1093
01:03:48,733 --> 01:03:49,533
Come with me.

1094
01:03:52,573 --> 01:03:53,733
Let him go!

1095
01:03:53,773 --> 01:03:54,893
Your hands!

1096
01:03:57,573 --> 01:03:58,613
Stop!

1097
01:03:59,893 --> 01:04:01,733
Hands behind your back!

1098
01:04:01,773 --> 01:04:02,573
Chris!

1099
01:04:02,933 --> 01:04:03,933
Let go!

1100
01:04:04,613 --> 01:04:06,533
- Taking it too far!
- Breaking my balls?

1101
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:12,333
What?

1102
01:04:13,613 --> 01:04:15,013
I am the Law!

1103
01:04:16,813 --> 01:04:17,653
What?

1104
01:04:18,293 --> 01:04:19,253
What you gonna do?

1105
01:04:19,893 --> 01:04:22,253
Can we talk, Salah?

1106
01:04:26,293 --> 01:04:27,453
Come with me.

1107
01:04:45,853 --> 01:04:47,893
The kid that stole the lion,

1108
01:04:48,493 --> 01:04:51,653
we tried to stop him
but his friends cornered us.

1109
01:04:52,133 --> 01:04:53,573
It happened so fast.

1110
01:04:54,213 --> 01:04:57,653
No harm was intended.
The flash-ball fired involuntarily.

1111
01:04:58,013 --> 01:05:00,333
I swear, believe me.

1112
01:05:00,373 --> 01:05:01,573
Involuntarily?

1113
01:05:02,413 --> 01:05:03,933
What are you saying?

1114
01:05:05,653 --> 01:05:06,573
It was an accident?

1115
01:05:08,293 --> 01:05:09,453
Not your fault?

1116
01:05:10,293 --> 01:05:11,453
As usual.

1117
01:05:11,893 --> 01:05:14,093
You don't know
how to use your weapons?

1118
01:05:14,733 --> 01:05:16,013
Bad luck?

1119
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:17,933
That's not what I'm saying.

1120
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:20,973
If the video gets out,
this place will burn.

1121
01:05:21,453 --> 01:05:25,813
What if voicing anger
was the only way to be heard?

1122
01:05:27,453 --> 01:05:29,692
Who did their anger serve in 2005?

1123
01:05:30,213 --> 01:05:31,333
No one.

1124
01:05:31,372 --> 01:05:32,812
They burned cars,

1125
01:05:33,292 --> 01:05:35,332
destroyed bus shelters. What's left?

1126
01:05:36,253 --> 01:05:37,173
A bare pole?

1127
01:05:37,573 --> 01:05:39,693
Not a bench to sit on. Nothing.

1128
01:05:40,053 --> 01:05:41,493
It backfired.

1129
01:05:42,532 --> 01:05:44,613
Worst thing is that no one cares.

1130
01:06:14,773 --> 01:06:16,053
Let me handle it.

1131
01:06:18,373 --> 01:06:19,413
How's the kid?

1132
01:06:20,613 --> 01:06:22,252
He'll pull through.

1133
01:06:23,373 --> 01:06:24,892
- Sure?
- He'll be okay.

1134
01:06:32,092 --> 01:06:33,772
I want to trust you.

1135
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:38,893
But you won't avoid their rage.

1136
01:07:42,253 --> 01:07:44,813
<i>Attention units. This is not a joke.</i>

1137
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:47,533
<i>A lion cub has been spotted
at the community garden.</i>

1138
01:07:48,093 --> 01:07:50,453
SCU responding, close by. On our way.

1139
01:08:12,373 --> 01:08:13,573
Pharaoh. Let's go.

1140
01:08:15,413 --> 01:08:16,653
Well done, kiddo.

1141
01:08:20,173 --> 01:08:20,973
Zorro.

1142
01:08:21,693 --> 01:08:23,053
Look who's here.

1143
01:08:23,093 --> 01:08:24,733
Gave you my word.

1144
01:08:24,773 --> 01:08:26,333
He brought my little man.

1145
01:08:28,053 --> 01:08:29,133
My Johnny.

1146
01:08:29,733 --> 01:08:30,693
My Johnny.

1147
01:08:31,493 --> 01:08:32,533
Is that Daddy?

1148
01:08:32,573 --> 01:08:33,973
Come here, my boy.

1149
01:08:35,133 --> 01:08:36,453
There...

1150
01:08:37,053 --> 01:08:37,973
Careful.

1151
01:08:40,453 --> 01:08:41,533
Attaboy!

1152
01:08:41,773 --> 01:08:42,573
Happy?

1153
01:08:43,093 --> 01:08:44,653
Happy to be home?

1154
01:08:51,493 --> 01:08:53,933
I brought you the thief to apologize.

1155
01:08:53,973 --> 01:08:54,773
Say sorry.

1156
01:08:55,133 --> 01:08:56,253
Sorry.

1157
01:08:56,293 --> 01:08:59,053
What happened buddy? You fall?

1158
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:00,533
He slipped.

1159
01:09:00,573 --> 01:09:02,173
What a slide!

1160
01:09:02,213 --> 01:09:04,013
Come here, let's talk.

1161
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:07,893
You can't do that.
We come here to perform.

1162
01:09:07,933 --> 01:09:10,653
We bring the circus. Animals.

1163
01:09:10,693 --> 01:09:13,573
You steal from us. Can't do that.

1164
01:09:13,613 --> 01:09:15,693
I don't steal in your hood.

1165
01:09:15,733 --> 01:09:17,293
Here, go in there.

1166
01:09:21,333 --> 01:09:22,693
Zorro! What you doing?

1167
01:09:22,733 --> 01:09:23,973
Stop playing!

1168
01:09:27,573 --> 01:09:28,893
He's not happy.

1169
01:09:28,933 --> 01:09:30,253
Enough with the jokes!

1170
01:09:31,293 --> 01:09:32,133
Let him out!

1171
01:09:33,413 --> 01:09:34,333
Let him out!

1172
01:09:34,373 --> 01:09:35,253
Let the kid out!

1173
01:09:36,933 --> 01:09:38,493
Let the kid out or else...

1174
01:09:44,373 --> 01:09:45,933
'The fuck away from me.

1175
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:51,133
He pissed himself.

1176
01:09:52,733 --> 01:09:54,853
I'm gonna pull the trigger.

1177
01:09:54,893 --> 01:09:55,973
Don't believe you!

1178
01:09:58,373 --> 01:09:59,773
Let the kid out.

1179
01:09:59,813 --> 01:10:00,853
Let him out!

1180
01:10:00,893 --> 01:10:01,933
It's a joke...

1181
01:10:01,973 --> 01:10:04,493
A joke? Let him out!

1182
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:07,013
It's okay. Don't be scared.

1183
01:10:07,053 --> 01:10:08,293
It's a joke.

1184
01:10:08,893 --> 01:10:10,013
Put the piece away.

1185
01:10:10,693 --> 01:10:12,253
Just a joke.

1186
01:10:12,973 --> 01:10:14,133
Sure it is.

1187
01:10:15,453 --> 01:10:17,733
- You a real schmuck.
- No, you are.

1188
01:10:17,773 --> 01:10:19,973
All good. Go home now.

1189
01:10:22,453 --> 01:10:23,973
Go fuck yourself!

1190
01:10:56,373 --> 01:10:57,733
Come here little man.

1191
01:11:03,013 --> 01:11:03,973
You okay?

1192
01:11:04,853 --> 01:11:06,333
Doesn't hurt anymore?

1193
01:11:07,253 --> 01:11:08,133
Let's see.

1194
01:11:08,853 --> 01:11:10,133
Just a bit red.

1195
01:11:11,573 --> 01:11:12,813
You'll be fine.

1196
01:11:18,533 --> 01:11:19,693
Listen up.

1197
01:11:22,573 --> 01:11:23,893
How did this happen?

1198
01:11:27,293 --> 01:11:30,133
If anyone asks, what will you say?

1199
01:11:31,693 --> 01:11:33,093
What's the answer?

1200
01:11:34,493 --> 01:11:36,093
You fell on the ground.

1201
01:11:36,933 --> 01:11:37,733
Know why?

1202
01:11:39,933 --> 01:11:43,533
Because Issa won't stop
messing up. Right?

1203
01:11:44,053 --> 01:11:45,853
So bad things happen.

1204
01:11:48,493 --> 01:11:50,333
It's your fault, understood?

1205
01:11:50,933 --> 01:11:52,973
You did this to yourself. Look at me.

1206
01:11:53,293 --> 01:11:54,653
You did this to yourself.

1207
01:11:56,373 --> 01:11:57,853
Say it.

1208
01:11:59,253 --> 01:12:00,453
What happened?

1209
01:12:02,573 --> 01:12:03,813
I can't hear you.

1210
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:05,373
I fell over.

1211
01:12:05,973 --> 01:12:07,773
Good. Who's fault?

1212
01:12:08,213 --> 01:12:09,853
My fault.

1213
01:12:10,173 --> 01:12:10,973
Good.

1214
01:12:11,613 --> 01:12:14,133
That's enough.
He gets it. Let him go.

1215
01:12:15,573 --> 01:12:16,653
Beat it. Go home.

1216
01:12:17,493 --> 01:12:18,693
He gets it.

1217
01:12:19,933 --> 01:12:20,973
'Fuck out of here.

1218
01:12:28,253 --> 01:12:30,533
- What's your problem?
- Leave him alone.

1219
01:12:30,893 --> 01:12:32,213
I don't like your tone.

1220
01:12:32,253 --> 01:12:33,173
Really?

1221
01:12:34,573 --> 01:12:35,853
He gave you the video?

1222
01:12:36,973 --> 01:12:37,893
Yes or no?

1223
01:12:37,933 --> 01:12:39,293
- I got it.
- Hand it over.

1224
01:12:40,213 --> 01:12:41,493
No, fuck you.

1225
01:12:41,533 --> 01:12:43,413
- Hands off!
- What did you say?

1226
01:12:43,453 --> 01:12:44,973
Easy. Easy.

1227
01:12:45,013 --> 01:12:46,893
The video stays in my pocket.

1228
01:12:46,933 --> 01:12:49,213
No one will see it, but I'm keeping it.

1229
01:12:50,453 --> 01:12:51,773
I'm okay with that.

1230
01:12:51,813 --> 01:12:53,013
Okay with what?

1231
01:12:53,053 --> 01:12:54,453
How is this okay?

1232
01:12:55,173 --> 01:12:56,973
You're under my command!

1233
01:12:57,013 --> 01:12:58,933
Not anymore. That's over.

1234
01:12:58,973 --> 01:13:00,693
- Come again, fuckface.
- Back off!

1235
01:13:02,493 --> 01:13:03,773
Some attitude.

1236
01:13:04,053 --> 01:13:06,373
I read your file. You're a cocksucker.

1237
01:13:08,173 --> 01:13:11,093
I'm head of this unit
cuz no one rides me.

1238
01:13:11,133 --> 01:13:12,333
Back off!

1239
01:13:12,373 --> 01:13:13,333
Chris!

1240
01:13:14,213 --> 01:13:15,373
What's going on?

1241
01:13:15,413 --> 01:13:17,853
Look at his face. He's a fucking rat.

1242
01:13:18,653 --> 01:13:21,413
Eager to report us to internal affairs.

1243
01:13:23,813 --> 01:13:24,813
Know what?

1244
01:13:25,413 --> 01:13:27,013
I didn't shoot a kid.

1245
01:13:27,053 --> 01:13:28,213
Shut up.

1246
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:31,213
I'll handle it.

1247
01:13:32,253 --> 01:13:35,493
Even if you get the video,
it won't stop him from talking.

1248
01:13:37,973 --> 01:13:39,133
I'm warning you.

1249
01:13:39,733 --> 01:13:42,653
You leak it,
the entire force will be against you.

1250
01:13:43,573 --> 01:13:44,813
Think about it.

1251
01:15:19,093 --> 01:15:20,093
You okay?

1252
01:15:21,173 --> 01:15:22,253
I'm okay.

1253
01:15:23,013 --> 01:15:24,533
I'm good. Already ate.

1254
01:15:25,373 --> 01:15:26,733
Already had a bite.

1255
01:15:27,293 --> 01:15:30,253
Not hungry. I'm tired, Mom.
Gonna go to bed.

1256
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,053
That's good.

1257
01:15:34,733 --> 01:15:37,133
Dad, she won't let me play.

1258
01:15:37,173 --> 01:15:38,653
Bonnie, let her play.

1259
01:15:39,573 --> 01:15:40,853
Give me a go.

1260
01:15:40,893 --> 01:15:42,653
I'll just finish this game.

1261
01:15:42,973 --> 01:15:44,453
Put them to bed, please.

1262
01:15:45,253 --> 01:15:47,013
Girls. Go to bed.

1263
01:15:47,053 --> 01:15:48,373
Give it to me.

1264
01:15:49,653 --> 01:15:51,413
Go to bed now.

1265
01:15:51,453 --> 01:15:53,093
I'll hurt your barbie.

1266
01:15:53,133 --> 01:15:54,373
Bonnie, stop that!

1267
01:15:54,853 --> 01:15:56,133
Right now!

1268
01:15:56,173 --> 01:15:57,453
I was playing.

1269
01:15:58,053 --> 01:15:59,133
Go to bed, now.

1270
01:15:59,933 --> 01:16:00,813
Lylan.

1271
01:16:01,893 --> 01:16:02,733
Go to bed.

1272
01:16:06,693 --> 01:16:08,053
Quit stomping.

1273
01:16:08,093 --> 01:16:09,133
Whatever.

1274
01:16:28,093 --> 01:16:29,253
I'm okay.

1275
01:17:39,493 --> 01:17:41,013
My boy, how are you?

1276
01:17:42,853 --> 01:17:44,133
How was school?

1277
01:17:45,733 --> 01:17:46,853
What did you do?

1278
01:18:48,053 --> 01:18:49,213
Want a drink?

1279
01:18:54,853 --> 01:18:56,893
Sparkling water, please.

1280
01:19:06,213 --> 01:19:07,093
You okay?

1281
01:19:08,293 --> 01:19:09,413
You?

1282
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:10,413
I'm okay.

1283
01:19:15,213 --> 01:19:16,213
Thanks.

1284
01:19:20,893 --> 01:19:22,533
Were you able to unwind?

1285
01:19:25,533 --> 01:19:26,493
And you?

1286
01:19:28,533 --> 01:19:29,373
Yeah.

1287
01:19:33,693 --> 01:19:36,253
Called my son.
Did a few things.

1288
01:19:38,293 --> 01:19:39,533
He's okay?

1289
01:19:40,453 --> 01:19:41,373
Yeah.

1290
01:19:43,173 --> 01:19:44,813
You don't have kids, do you?

1291
01:19:47,133 --> 01:19:48,253
Not yet.

1292
01:19:49,453 --> 01:19:50,853
It's a good feeling.

1293
01:19:55,373 --> 01:19:56,373
So.

1294
01:20:02,013 --> 01:20:03,893
I know how a flash-ball trigger works.

1295
01:20:04,653 --> 01:20:06,533
You can't fire by accident.

1296
01:20:10,173 --> 01:20:12,093
That's not what I told Salah but...

1297
01:20:12,973 --> 01:20:14,573
What happened?

1298
01:20:20,813 --> 01:20:23,013
I dunno why. I fucked up.

1299
01:20:25,493 --> 01:20:27,893
I saw it coming.
I've been stressed out...

1300
01:20:29,773 --> 01:20:32,533
With all those kids screaming...

1301
01:20:36,773 --> 01:20:38,213
I just lost it.

1302
01:20:41,853 --> 01:20:44,453
I lost my temper. Just lost it.

1303
01:20:48,093 --> 01:20:50,293
It was their fault? You serious?

1304
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:53,453
We were ambushed by kids.

1305
01:20:53,853 --> 01:20:55,333
You shot at close range.

1306
01:20:55,373 --> 01:20:57,173
He was handcuffed.
Could've died.

1307
01:20:57,413 --> 01:20:59,053
I'm sorry for little Issa.

1308
01:20:59,493 --> 01:21:00,493
Really?

1309
01:21:02,013 --> 01:21:03,213
Sorry for what?

1310
01:21:05,373 --> 01:21:06,893
You told him you were sorry?

1311
01:21:07,973 --> 01:21:10,813
Like Chris says, never say sorry.

1312
01:21:14,093 --> 01:21:15,333
Listen...

1313
01:21:16,053 --> 01:21:19,253
This was the worst day of my life
teamed up with you

1314
01:21:19,293 --> 01:21:20,573
and that dimwit Chris.

1315
01:21:21,653 --> 01:21:24,053
All you do is screw up.

1316
01:21:27,493 --> 01:21:29,773
You just arrived
and you're lecturing us?

1317
01:21:33,173 --> 01:21:34,933
We have to act this way.

1318
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:37,053
You saw the night unit?

1319
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:40,613
All Rambo-ed up.
We're the only ones respected.

1320
01:21:43,973 --> 01:21:45,253
Respect?

1321
01:21:45,933 --> 01:21:47,693
People around here just fear you.

1322
01:21:47,733 --> 01:21:49,093
I grew up here.

1323
01:21:50,773 --> 01:21:53,253
We've been working
these streets 10 years.

1324
01:21:55,053 --> 01:21:56,533
This is our life.

1325
01:22:17,013 --> 01:22:18,053
Know what?

1326
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:25,573
Keep it.

1327
01:22:27,773 --> 01:22:29,093
Do what you gotta do.

1328
01:23:05,253 --> 01:23:06,693
Let's get Haroona.

1329
01:23:07,893 --> 01:23:09,693
Get Boodlal.

1330
01:23:11,293 --> 01:23:12,373
Get Yussuf.

1331
01:23:29,133 --> 01:23:30,053
Cops!

1332
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:32,893
Hide!

1333
01:23:48,973 --> 01:23:50,013
Yo, bugs.

1334
01:23:50,053 --> 01:23:51,173
It's Pink Pig.

1335
01:23:51,213 --> 01:23:52,013
Come here.

1336
01:23:52,653 --> 01:23:53,693
What's going on?

1337
01:23:53,733 --> 01:23:55,173
Just hanging.

1338
01:23:55,613 --> 01:23:57,213
No Club Med today?

1339
01:23:59,773 --> 01:24:01,133
Do the Pink Pig.

1340
01:24:02,733 --> 01:24:03,653
Go play.

1341
01:24:16,933 --> 01:24:17,933
Beat it!

1342
01:24:23,973 --> 01:24:25,253
Drive off!

1343
01:24:52,453 --> 01:24:53,253
There!

1344
01:25:09,093 --> 01:25:10,573
Out of my way!

1345
01:25:14,293 --> 01:25:15,613
Stop right there!

1346
01:25:23,253 --> 01:25:24,773
Let them have their fun.

1347
01:25:25,613 --> 01:25:26,933
Move!

1348
01:25:27,413 --> 01:25:28,653
Piss off!

1349
01:25:29,453 --> 01:25:30,413
Get out!

1350
01:25:32,173 --> 01:25:34,133
Retard, watch your mom cry.

1351
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:20,413
There are kids trailing us.

1352
01:26:23,813 --> 01:26:24,893
What are they doing?

1353
01:26:26,773 --> 01:26:28,413
Looking for a spanking?

1354
01:26:57,653 --> 01:26:58,933
What do they want?

1355
01:27:10,093 --> 01:27:11,373
Son of a bitch!

1356
01:27:20,453 --> 01:27:21,853
Block the elevator!

1357
01:27:22,533 --> 01:27:23,933
We need backup.

1358
01:27:23,973 --> 01:27:25,533
Three gremlins. We got this.

1359
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:26,693
Out of service.

1360
01:27:27,653 --> 01:27:28,973
Call backup.

1361
01:27:29,613 --> 01:27:32,773
SCU to HQ, we need backup.

1362
01:27:45,413 --> 01:27:46,333
<i>Location?</i>

1363
01:27:46,373 --> 01:27:47,613
Fuck, wait...

1364
01:27:49,573 --> 01:27:51,853
<i>This is HQ, your location?</i>

1365
01:27:55,373 --> 01:27:57,333
<i>What is your location, SCU?</i>

1366
01:28:00,853 --> 01:28:03,173
- 7 Picasso street.
- <i>Say that again.</i>

1367
01:28:56,733 --> 01:28:58,253
Come here, asshole!

1368
01:29:02,773 --> 01:29:04,813
Motherfuck you!

1369
01:29:23,733 --> 01:29:24,853
Beat it!

1370
01:29:35,773 --> 01:29:36,733
Motherfuck you!

1371
01:29:55,493 --> 01:29:56,813
Scram, asshole!

1372
01:29:57,413 --> 01:29:59,173
Stay there!

1373
01:29:59,213 --> 01:30:01,373
Let go, asshole!

1374
01:30:01,613 --> 01:30:03,333
Motherfucker, let him go!

1375
01:30:29,533 --> 01:30:30,653
Get back!

1376
01:30:31,613 --> 01:30:32,733
What's going on?

1377
01:30:33,413 --> 01:30:34,773
What's the problem?

1378
01:30:34,813 --> 01:30:36,293
What's going on?

1379
01:30:36,333 --> 01:30:38,533
Move! Get out of my way!

1380
01:30:38,813 --> 01:30:39,773
Beat it!

1381
01:30:41,093 --> 01:30:42,613
Tough guys, now?

1382
01:30:43,013 --> 01:30:44,093
What's wrong?

1383
01:30:45,613 --> 01:30:47,293
Who gave you permission?

1384
01:30:48,853 --> 01:30:49,933
What's wrong?

1385
01:30:50,653 --> 01:30:51,733
You tough?

1386
01:30:56,213 --> 01:30:58,773
What's your fucking problem?

1387
01:30:59,053 --> 01:31:01,133
What are you trying to do?

1388
01:31:01,933 --> 01:31:03,573
Driving me crazy,

1389
01:31:04,493 --> 01:31:07,373
who gave you permission, fuckers?

1390
01:31:07,413 --> 01:31:08,813
Who told you?

1391
01:31:09,253 --> 01:31:11,333
What's wrong with you?

1392
01:31:12,093 --> 01:31:13,453
You tough now?

1393
01:31:13,493 --> 01:31:14,693
Assholes!

1394
01:31:14,733 --> 01:31:15,933
Scram!

1395
01:31:16,533 --> 01:31:17,453
What do you want?

1396
01:31:23,533 --> 01:31:25,613
Motherfuck you, son of a bitch!

1397
01:31:37,933 --> 01:31:38,973
Mortar!

1398
01:32:01,093 --> 01:32:01,893
Fuck!

1399
01:32:05,333 --> 01:32:06,373
Fucking bitches!

1400
01:32:07,453 --> 01:32:09,293
- Chris, you okay?
- My eye!

1401
01:32:17,053 --> 01:32:18,853
Fucking bugs!

1402
01:32:21,293 --> 01:32:22,933
Piss me off!

1403
01:32:59,573 --> 01:33:00,373
Move away!

1404
01:33:09,813 --> 01:33:10,773
Come...

1405
01:33:32,653 --> 01:33:34,133
Motherfuckers!

1406
01:33:47,653 --> 01:33:48,773
Open up! Open!

1407
01:33:49,813 --> 01:33:51,253
Is there someone there?

1408
01:33:51,293 --> 01:33:52,533
Please open up! Help!

1409
01:33:53,373 --> 01:33:54,573
Help!

1410
01:33:59,493 --> 01:34:00,613
Help!

1411
01:34:03,773 --> 01:34:05,333
Please open up!

1412
01:34:05,373 --> 01:34:07,693
I beg you! Please!

1413
01:34:15,813 --> 01:34:17,373
Don't do it, Issa! Please!

1414
01:34:17,413 --> 01:34:18,373
Put it down!

1415
01:34:18,413 --> 01:34:20,253
Listen, Issa! Put it down!

1416
01:34:21,893 --> 01:34:23,373
Listen to me!

1417
01:34:26,013 --> 01:34:27,093
Step back!

1418
01:35:30,293 --> 01:35:33,773
<i>"Remember this, my friends,</i>
