1
00:01:13,658 --> 00:01:16,410
Nick, this was a tragedy,
but it's not why we're here.

2
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:18,746
What, are we fighting the weather now?

3
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,582
Locals say the cyclone had a face.

4
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:24,335
People see things
when they're under stress.

5
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:28,881
That does not mean that this is the start
to some other big world-ending--

6
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:35,179
Who are you?

7
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,436
You don't want any part of this.

8
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:00,639
Gone but not forgotten.

9
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:02,808
Thanks to Kenneth Lim
and Vihaan Ramamurthy

10
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:04,935
for their help
with that touching video tribute.

11
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:09,607
- This year has been nothing short of--
- **** is crazy. It's insane.

12
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,608
- Jason.
- What?

13
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,984
No swearing.

14
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:13,819
It's the last day of school. We're good.

15
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:15,946
Historic.

16
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,533
Over five years ago,
half of all life in the universe,

17
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:23,829
<i>including our own Midtown High,
was wiped from existence.</i>

18
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:26,540
Then eight months ago,
a band of brave heroes

19
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:27,625
<i>brought us back.</i>

20
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:31,587
They called it "the Blip."

21
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,256
<i>Those of us who Blipped away
came back the same age...</i>

22
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,928
<i>But our classmates that didn't Blip
had grown five years older.</i>

23
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:43,015
- My little brother is now older than me.
- Yeah, it's math.

24
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:46,143
Even though we had Blipped away
halfway through the school year

25
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,437
and had already taken midterms,

26
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:51,190
the school made us start the whole year
over from the beginning.

27
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,942
It's totally unfair.

28
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,151
It's not right.

29
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:59,156
Tigers, it's been a long, dramatic,
somewhat confusing road.

30
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,700
<i>As we draw this year to a close,</i>

31
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,994
<i>it's time to move on...</i>

32
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,165
<i>-to a new phase of our lives.
- Pray nothing crazy happens again</i>

33
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:10,334
<i>because are the Avengers even
a thing anymore?</i>

34
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:13,337
- <i>Does anyone even have a plan?</i>
- I have a plan.

35
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,756
Okay, first, I'm gonna sit
next to MJ on the flight.

36
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:18,467
Second, I'm gonna buy
a dual-headphone adapter

37
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:20,261
and watch movies with her
the whole time.

38
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,471
- Okay.
- Three, when we go to Venice--

39
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:24,432
Venice is famous for making stuff
out of glass, right?

40
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:25,808
- True.
- So I'm gonna buy her

41
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,978
a black dahlia necklace because
her favorite flower is the black dahlia

42
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:30,479
- because of, well...
- The murder.

43
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:32,440
The murder. Four, when we go to Paris,

44
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,817
I'm gonna take her to the top
of the Eiffel Tower,

45
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,485
give her the necklace.

46
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:38,446
Then, five, I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

47
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:42,908
Then, six, hopefully she tells me
she feels the same way.

48
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,326
Oh, don't forget step seven.

49
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,412
- Step seven?
- Don't do any of that.

50
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,708
- Why?
- We're gonna be bachelors in Europe.

51
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,709
- Ned.
- Look,

52
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,170
I may not know much, but I do know this:

53
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,630
Europeans love Americans.

54
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,508
- Really?
- More than half of them are women.

55
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:01,177
Okay. Sure.

56
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,180
But I really like MJ, man, okay?

57
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:07,016
She's awesome, she's super funny
in a kind of dark way.

58
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:09,768
Sometimes I catch her looking at me,
I feel like I've stood up--

59
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,854
- She's coming. Don't say anything.
- What up, dorks?

60
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:15,774
- Excited about the science trip?
- Hey, we're talking about the trip.

61
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,319
- Yeah, and Peter's plan.
- You have a plan?

62
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:21,322
I don't-- I don't have a plan.

63
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:26,035
No, he's just gonna collect tiny spoons
when we're traveling to other countries.

64
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,620
Like a grandmother?

65
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,040
I'm not collecting tiny spoons.
He's collecting tiny spoons.

66
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,666
Oh, okay, well...

67
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,420
that was a real roller coaster.

68
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:37,546
By the way, travel tip:

69
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,715
You should download a VPN
on your phone,

70
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,134
so the government can't track you
while we're abroad.

71
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:44,720
Smart. Will do.

72
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,895
Dude, I think that went really great.

73
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,274
When I Blipped back to my apartment,

74
00:05:57,358 --> 00:06:00,319
the family that was living there
was very confused.

75
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,072
The wife thought that I was a mistress.

76
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:07,284
The grandma thought that I was a ghost.
It was-- It was really a mess.

77
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:08,953
Thank you for coming out

78
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,539
to support those who have been
displaced by the Blip.

79
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:15,417
And, of course,
thanks to our very own Spider-Man!

80
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,265
Thank you, Miss Parker, for having me.

81
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:31,809
And thank you, you guys, for having me.

82
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,646
And thank you, Spider-Man.

83
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,733
He'll be right back out
to take photos and videos. Thank you!

84
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,533
- That was amazing.
- That was great.

85
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:51,078
- That was so cool. I was so nervous.
- I was a little stiff. I wasn't in the pocket.

86
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,123
- I thought you did great.
- You were a little stiff.

87
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,750
Yeah, I felt that too. I felt that too.

88
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,210
- It's fine, it's fine.
- Okay.

89
00:06:58,294 --> 00:06:59,712
- Did you get your passport?
- Yeah.

90
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,046
- Mini toothpaste?
- Yeah, I did.

91
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,133
Hey, sorry I'm late.

92
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,553
- Happy. Hey.
- Oh, you look lovely.

93
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,597
- Thanks. You too.
- Thank you.

94
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,724
- New dress?
- Yeah, yes, it is.

95
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,102
- It's a new beard.
- It's my-- My Blip beard.

96
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,854
I grew it in the Blip.

97
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:18,647
It's a Blip beard.

98
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:19,940
I see. Yeah.

99
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:23,360
The reason I'm late is
because this was misplaced at the office.

100
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:26,530
Can you believe it? Because
it's enormous. Not the amount, the size.

101
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:29,116
The amount's nice too. They're generous.

102
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,660
- Pepper said, sorry she couldn't be here.
- Yeah. Thank you.

103
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:36,248
I think I'm gonna go change
the Sterno under the vegan lasagne.

104
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,209
Spider-Man, go shake hands.

105
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:40,961
Will do.

106
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:46,717
What just happened?

107
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,803
Heads up, Nick Fury's calling you.

108
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,889
- Fury's gonna call me? Why?
- Yeah.

109
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,767
Why? He probably has hero stuff
for you to do.

110
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,935
You're a superhero.
He calls superheroes.

111
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:00,356
If it was that important,
he'd probably call someone else, not me.

112
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,566
Apparently not.

113
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,531
- No caller ID. That's him.
- I don't wanna talk to Fury.

114
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:10,616
- Answer the phone.
- Why?

115
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,993
If you don't talk to him, I have to,
and I don't want to.

116
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:15,287
- Why not?
- Because I'm scared. Answer the phone.

117
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,666
- You sent Nick Fury to voicemail?
- Yeah.

118
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:21,502
- You don't send Fury to voicemail.
- Hear that? They're calling me.

119
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,253
- I gotta go.
- You gotta talk to him.

120
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,923
I'm gonna call him.
I promise you, I'm gonna call him. I will.

121
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,883
You do not ghost Nick Fury.

122
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,760
I promise you, I'll call him.

123
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,888
After my trip.

124
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:33,806
Hey!

125
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:38,018
Yeah, hi-- No, no, he's not ghosting you.

126
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:42,690
Okay, one question at a time.

127
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,150
Are you the head Avenger?
Are you the head Avenger now?

128
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:46,652
No, I'm not.

129
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,904
If the aliens come back,
what are you gonna do?

130
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,531
If the aliens come back, what will you do?

131
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:52,991
Does anyone have
any neighborhood questions?

132
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,411
Sean Winford, <i>Queens Tribune.</i>

133
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,329
What it is like to take over
from Tony Stark?

134
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:58,872
Those are some big shoes to fill.

135
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:06,296
I'm-- I'm gonna go.
Thanks so much, everyone, for coming.

136
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:36,296
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

137
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,088
Okay.

138
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,179
Hungry?

139
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,932
So sorry.

140
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:02,394
I thought you could sense that
with your Peter-tingle.

141
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:04,813
Please do not start calling it
my Peter-tingle.

142
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,941
What's up? You can dodge bullets
but not bananas?

143
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:11,737
No, I just really need this vacation.
I need a break.

144
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:13,697
You deserve it.

145
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,034
Yeah.

146
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:18,869
You know what?

147
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,998
You should pack your suit, just in case.
I have a tingle about it.

148
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,418
Please stop saying "tingle," May.

149
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,047
No.

150
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,096
No. No, I'm not.

151
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:46,396
- Yeah!
- Can you help me get my stuff up here?

152
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,649
- Oh, sorry, that's mine.
- No worries.

153
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:52,194
- Middle seat gets both armrests.
- Give me a tablet.

154
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,947
Do you want the first shift
or the second? I could take either.

155
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,074
Give me the third shift. I took an Ambien.

156
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,993
- I can't chaperone these kids alone.
- Yo, Parker.

157
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:03,038
This is called an airplane.
It's like the buses you're used to,

158
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,542
except it flies over the poor neighborhoods
instead of driving through them.

159
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,168
Ma'am?

160
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:11,964
He Blipped, so technically,
he's 16, not 21.

161
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,215
I'll take that.

162
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,759
She's lying. I don't even know this girl.

163
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,805
Classic MJ, right?

164
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,184
Did you know Brad was coming?

165
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:26,186
It-- It's so weird.

166
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,189
One day, he's that kid who cried
and got nosebleeds all the time,

167
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,275
and suddenly, we Blip back,

168
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,987
and he's totally ripped and super nice
and all these girls are after him.

169
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,407
- Not all the girls are after him.
- No, man, they're all after him.

170
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,783
Yeah. Here.

171
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,536
Anyway, on to more important things.

172
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:46,081
It's a nine-hour flight. We can play
<i>Beast Slayers</i> the whole time.

173
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,457
Are you excited?

174
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:50,168
I need your help to sit next to MJ.

175
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,881
- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously.

176
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,925
What about our plan?
American bachelors in Europe.

177
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,803
That's your plan. That's a solo plan.
Come on, this is my plan.

178
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,266
Please.

179
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,063
Hey, guys.

180
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:14,234
There's an old lady in front of us
wearing a crazy amount of perfume,

181
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:17,446
and it's kind of setting off
Peter's allergies.

182
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,700
Betty, if you could switch seats with him,
that would be--

183
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,951
He's allergic to perfume?

184
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,038
Yeah, yeah, because it--

185
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,748
It makes his eyes water,

186
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,125
- and he can't really--
- Peter has a perfume allergy?

187
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,587
From experience,
perfume allergies are no joke.

188
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,965
I can feel hives breaking out already.
MJ, stand up.

189
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:40,844
Ned, take MJ's spot.
MJ, you take my spot.

190
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,387
Peter, let's get you out of there.

191
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:44,306
- Sorry.
- Zach and Sebastian,

192
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,725
- you take Ned and Peter's seats.
- That's all right.

193
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:49,227
Ned, thanks for bringing this
to my attention.

194
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:53,065
Your safety is my responsibility.
And Mr. Dell's, but he's...

195
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,567
I got it for now. Let's go, Peter!

196
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:56,985
Let's go!

197
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:07,412
Yeah, I have a small bladder,
so I took the aisle.

198
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,876
So did you want to play <i>Beast Slayer?</i>

199
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,794
Nope.

200
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,339
Have you ever played
any kind of PC game or--?

201
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,925
- No.
- Got it.

202
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,427
Did I tell you
how my wife pretended to Blip out?

203
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,640
Turns out, she ran off
with a guy in her hiking group.

204
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,183
We had a fake funeral for her.

205
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,353
Well, the funeral was real
because I thought she was really dead.

206
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,479
Wanna see the video?

207
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,482
Oh, I got a dual-headphone adapter
if you want to watch a movie.

208
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,068
Only if it's depressing. Or hilarious.

209
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,113
Oh, you have a dual-headphone adapter.
We can watch together.

210
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,783
<i>Good afternoon,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

211
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,704
<i>Our flight time will be eight hours,
49 minutes to Venice, Italy.</i>

212
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,437
Nice picture.

213
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,939
Hey, did you see Brad and MJ
on the plane?

214
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,317
They were watching movies
and laughing the entire time.

215
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,985
Dude, don't worry, okay?

216
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,196
- I'm sure that's nothing.
- Hey, babe.

217
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,530
Can you hold this?

218
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,324
- Yeah, of course.
- Thanks.

219
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,167
What was that?

220
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:21,588
Well, we got to talking on the plane,
and it turns out,

221
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,173
we have a lot in common.

222
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,801
So we're boyfriend and girlfriend now.

223
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,637
Whatever happened to being
an American bachelor in Europe?

224
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,431
Peter, those were the words of a boy.

225
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,975
And that boy met a woman.

226
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,812
A very strong and powerful woman.

227
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,731
And now that boy's a man.

228
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:41,441
- Babe?
- Coming, babe.

229
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:49,116
There's nothing in there. I swear.

230
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:06,633
These, no.

231
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,519
Sorry. Sorry.

232
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,605
- I'm here. Mr. Harrington.
- Wait, wait, wait.

233
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,649
- I'm here, I'm here.
- Oh, thank goodness.

234
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,228
Looks like we're here.
They're doing renovations to the place.

235
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,856
- Getting some upgrades.
- Oh, this is trash.

236
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,399
- That must be the concierge.
- Okay.

237
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,609
Come on, man.

238
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,820
Everyone, here we are.

239
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,449
- Tell me we're not staying here.
- Come on in.

240
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,075
This place is sinking.

241
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,286
- You mean, "charming."
- It stinks.

242
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,747
Okay, everybody, drop your bags off.

243
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,625
We're gonna meet
at the da Vinci Museum at 3. Let's go!

244
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,793
- <i>!Vámonos!</i>
- It's <i>"andiamo."</i>

245
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,086
- <i>Andiamo!</i>
- There you go.

246
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,755
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

247
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,798
When you're in Venice,
your socks get wet.

248
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,806
What's up, Flash Mob?
How you guys doing?

249
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,767
I'm here in St. Marco Polo's--

250
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,395
- This is so much fun.
- Yeah?

251
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,921
- Three, two, one.
- Say "pizza."

252
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,257
- Pizza!
- Pizza time!

253
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:32,946
Hi.

254
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,531
I'm looking for a...

255
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,085
It's perfect.

256
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:57,762
What?

257
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:01,850
The most perfect word.
Italians created it, I just discovered it.

258
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,019
- What does it mean?
- It can mean a million things.

259
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,812
"I don't know." "Get out of my face."

260
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,814
"I don't know" and "Get out of my face."

261
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,608
It's the best thing Italy created,
except for, maybe, espresso.

262
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:13,361
Oh, so you've been drinking espresso.

263
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:16,364
Hey. German? American.

264
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:17,907
A rose for you.

265
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,162
<i>"Boh"</i>' is my new superpower.

266
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:24,831
It's like the anti-"aloha."
I was born to say this word.

267
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:27,417
So, what's in the bag?

268
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,172
Nice.

269
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,514
Whoa, cool.

270
00:19:58,365 --> 00:19:59,324
What was that?

271
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,432
- Betty! You okay?
- Yeah.

272
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,893
- Oh, my God!
- Come on.

273
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,436
Guys, we gotta go!

274
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,650
- What is that?
- I don't know.

275
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,568
- What'll you do?
- Left my suit in the hotel.

276
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,529
- Why?
- I'm on vacation, Ned!

277
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,114
Everyone will see my face.
Get them out of here.

278
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:40,115
- Go!
- Just go!

279
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:51,751
Get out of here. Go!

280
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:55,547
Oh, my God.

281
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,639
Come on.

282
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:19,362
Oh, no, you don't.

283
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,041
You okay? Get out of here. Go!

284
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:24,135
Excuse me, sir!

285
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:25,929
I-- I can help. Let me help.

286
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,680
I'm really strong, and I'm sticky.

287
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,974
I need to lead it away from the canals.

288
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:58,795
The da Vinci Museum.
This is why we're here in Venice.

289
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,505
Oh, this is it.

290
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:01,756
It's closed.

291
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,633
What do you mean? Till when?

292
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:04,717
November.

293
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,595
- You didn't check the website?
- Oh, that's a good idea.

294
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:23,987
Oh, come on.

295
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,201
Stay low, kids. We'll be safe here.

296
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,345
Who is that guy?

297
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:32,472
I don't know,
but he's kicking that water's ass.

298
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,922
Yeah! Yeah!

299
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:23,356
It's aliens. It has to be.

300
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,483
BuzzFeed says there's a sailor
named Morris Bench

301
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,902
who was exposed to an experimental
underwater generator

302
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,237
and got hydro powers.

303
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,407
Yeah, you should definitely believe
everything you read on the Internet.

304
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,909
- Spider-Man could take him.
- What do you think it is?

305
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:39,122
Being a man of science...

306
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:41,582
witches.

307
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,543
No, no, no. We wanna stay.

308
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,294
Good thing I packed your suit.

309
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:48,214
- <i>I can it believe you forgot it.</i>
- Yeah.

310
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,050
So who was that guy that you were with?
Was that Mr. Strange?

311
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:55,680
Doctor Strange, May. Doctor Strange.
And, no, I don't know who that was.

312
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:56,931
<i>It was a new guy.</i>

313
00:25:57,014 --> 00:25:59,183
- I was trying to help him--
- Happy, that's my lunch.

314
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,435
Don't eat that one.

315
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:03,563
- Happy's there?
- Yeah, it's Happy.

316
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,815
He's here. He came by to volunteer.

317
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,067
<i>And he's hanging around the office.</i>

318
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,570
- And he wants to say hi.
- I don't want-- Hi, Peter.

319
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,113
Hey, Happy.

320
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:17,034
Sorry, I'm working hard here.
I gotta do a-- A leaflet drop.

321
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,996
- What are you doing--?
- <i>Glad you're having a good time.</i>

322
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,123
Don't worry,
I'm really taking care of your aunt.

323
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:27,587
So how's the plan going?

324
00:26:29,714 --> 00:26:31,632
There's been setbacks, for sure.

325
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:34,218
Don't overthink it.
Trust your instincts and you'll be fine.

326
00:26:34,302 --> 00:26:35,136
<i>I know. Love you.</i>

327
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:36,429
Bye.

328
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:39,807
Who is that guy?

329
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:42,435
He's like Iron Man and Thor
rolled into one.

330
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,645
He's all right. He's no Spider-Man.

331
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,564
What is it with you and Spider-Man?

332
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,650
What? He's just awesome, okay?

333
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:53,070
He protects the neighborhood
and he's inspiring.

334
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:55,281
He inspires me to be a better man.

335
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,700
What's up, dickwad?
Thought you drowned.

336
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,663
Sounds like his name's Mysterio.

337
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,709
<i>"L'uomo del misterio"</i> is Italian
for "man of mystery."

338
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:09,962
- They don't actually know who he is.
- Mysterio.

339
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,298
- Cool name.
- Cool name.

340
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:14,717
- Babe.
- Babe.

341
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,761
So how much of that did you see?

342
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,805
Not much. I was running.

343
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,724
Right. Me too. I was also running...

344
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:22,934
away.

345
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,354
So Paris tomorrow.

346
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:30,149
Go to the Eiffel Tower. Should be great.

347
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,777
Yeah, I read it was secretly built
as a mind-control antenna

348
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,487
to create an army of the insane.

349
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:38,825
Which is why it's my favorite destination
on the whole trip.

350
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:43,454
What are you gonna do about
the water monster?

351
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:45,039
Nothing.

352
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:48,125
It's dead.
Besides, that Mysterio guy's all over it.

353
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:50,044
I just wanna spend some time with MJ.

354
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:53,297
We were talking about Paris,
and I think she really likes me.

355
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:54,340
That's nice.

356
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,509
Reminds me
of when Betty and I first fell in love.

357
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,761
I had just finished
my fruit cobbler, right, and--

358
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:07,311
You're a very difficult person
to contact, Spider-Man.

359
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,983
You're Nick Fury.

360
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:14,318
And you just shot Ned.

361
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:16,696
It's a mild tranquilizer. He'll be all right.

362
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:19,991
So good to finally meet you.

363
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:21,784
I saw you at the funeral,

364
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:24,412
but I didn't think that was a good time
to exchange numbers.

365
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,455
That would've been inappropriate.

366
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:28,583
- That's what I just said.
- Right.

367
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:32,461
The important thing is, you're here.
I tried to bring you here.

368
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:35,423
You avoided me, and now you're here.

369
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:37,216
What a coincidence.

370
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,468
Wait. Was this a coincidence?

371
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:42,847
I used to know everything.

372
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,601
Then I come back five years later,
and now I know nothing.

373
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:49,395
No intel, no team.

374
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,689
And a high school kid

375
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,734
is dodging my calls.

376
00:28:54,817 --> 00:28:56,402
Here's what I do know:

377
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:04,285
A week ago, a village in Mexico
was wiped out by a cyclone.

378
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:07,788
Witnesses say that cyclone had a face.

379
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:16,130
Three days later,
a similar event in Morocco.

380
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,340
A village was--

381
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,217
Just making the rounds.

382
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:23,763
See if anyone needs any counseling
after today's traumatic events.

383
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:26,390
No, we'll be okay. We're fine. Thank you.

384
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:29,727
Great because I'm--
I'm not qualified to actually--

385
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:31,354
Oh, he's passed out.

386
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:34,607
I'm not qualified to do it anyway,
so good night.

387
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:39,695
That was my teacher. Sorry about that.
You were saying?

388
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,990
A village was destroyed by what
may well be another world-threatening--

389
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:46,202
Babe, you still awake?
You're not answering any of my texts.

390
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:47,995
He's asleep, Betty.

391
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,455
Oh, already?

392
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:51,290
- Yeah.
- Okay.

393
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:53,167
That's why it's imperative--

394
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:57,713
Hey, boys. So that canal water today
was filled with dangerous bacteria...

395
00:29:57,797 --> 00:30:01,550
Another person touches that door,
we are going to attend another funeral.

396
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:04,679
- Suit up.
- Let me know if you develop vomiting.

397
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:10,351
Stark left these for you.

398
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:11,686
Really?

399
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:26,450
"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."

400
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:31,831
Stark said you wouldn't get that
because it's not a <i>Star Wars</i> reference.

401
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:38,713
You can lose the mask.
Everyone here has seen you without it.

402
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:40,423
You'd be feigning anonymity

403
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,925
and breathing through spandex
for no good reason.

404
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,140
Come on.

405
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:51,225
Yeah.

406
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:57,106
Over there, we have Maria Hill.

407
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,818
That is Dimitri.

408
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:05,156
And this is Mr. Beck.

409
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:08,409
Mysterio?

410
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:09,785
What?

411
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:13,873
Doesn't matter. It's just what
my friends have been calling you.

412
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:16,500
Well, you can call me Quentin.

413
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,257
You handled yourself well out there today.
I saw what you did with the tower.

414
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,259
We could use someone like you
on my world.

415
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,053
Thanks.

416
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:28,554
I'm sorry. Your world?

417
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,348
Mr. Beck is from Earth.

418
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:32,975
Just not yours.

419
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,769
There are multiple realities.

420
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:37,980
This is Earth Dimension 616.
I'm from Earth 833.

421
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:41,192
Sorry, you're saying there's a multiverse?

422
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:43,152
I thought that was theoretical.

423
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,529
That changes how we understand
the initial singularity.

424
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:47,782
We're talking about
an eternal inflation system.

425
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:49,867
How does that even work
with all the quantum--?

426
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,951
It's insane.

427
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:55,331
Sorry. It's really cool.

428
00:31:56,457 --> 00:31:58,709
Don't ever apologize for being
the smartest one in the room.

429
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,129
Anyway...

430
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,802
They were born in stable orbits
within black holes.

431
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:10,054
Creatures formed
from the primary elements:

432
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:12,681
Air, water, fire, earth.

433
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:15,309
The Science Division had
a technical name.

434
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,478
We just called them Elementals.

435
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,980
Versions of them exist
across our mythologies.

436
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:21,857
Turns out, the myths are real.

437
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:23,734
Like Thor.

438
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:26,904
Thor was a myth,
now I study him in my physics class.

439
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,406
These myths are threats.

440
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:32,159
They first materialized
on my Earth many years ago.

441
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:33,494
We mobilized and fought them,

442
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:36,247
but with each battle,
they grew, got stronger.

443
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,291
I was part of the last battalion left
trying to stop them.

444
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,585
All we did was delay the inevitable.

445
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:44,964
The Elementals are here now,
attacking the same coordinates.

446
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:46,215
Our satellites confirm it.

447
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,009
Thank Mr. Beck for destroying
the other three.

448
00:32:49,093 --> 00:32:50,845
There's only one left: fire.

449
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:54,849
The strongest of them all.
The one that destroyed my Earth.

450
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,769
It's the one that took my family.

451
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,691
I'm sorry.

452
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:06,235
And it will be in Prague
in approximately 48 hours.

453
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:10,489
We have one mission: kill it.
And you're coming with us.

454
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,243
I'm sorry, did you say Prague?

455
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:19,957
Mr. Fury, this all seems like big time,
you know, huge superhero kind of stuff.

456
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,544
And I'm just a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.

457
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,421
Bitch, please. You've been to space.

458
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,173
I know, but that was an accident.

459
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:29,175
There's gotta be someone else
you can use.

460
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:32,136
- What about Thor?
- Off-world.

461
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,929
Okay, Doctor Strange.

462
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,556
- Unavailable.
- Captain Marvel.

463
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,057
Don't invoke her name.

464
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:39,101
Sir, look, I wanna help. I do.

465
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:41,770
But if my aunt finds out I left
my class trip, she'll kill me.

466
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:44,231
And if I'm seen in Europe
after the Washington Monument,

467
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:46,859
my class will figure out who I am, then--

468
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,195
Then the whole world will figure out
who I am, and then I'm done.

469
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,072
Okay.

470
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:53,574
I understand.

471
00:33:55,034 --> 00:33:56,035
I'm sorry, what?

472
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:58,829
Why don't you get back
before your teachers miss you

473
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:00,623
and become suspicious.

474
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:02,875
Dimitri.

475
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,211
Take him back to the hotel, please.

476
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,212
Yes.

477
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:08,297
Thank you, Mr. Fury.

478
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,341
And good luck.

479
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:13,802
See you, kid.

480
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:14,970
Yeah, see you.

481
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:18,807
- Bye, ma'am.
- Yeah.

482
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:27,316
Drink lots of water.
I'm gonna get you a vitamin C pill.

483
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,277
- You cannot get sick, okay?
- Okay. Thanks, baby.

484
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:32,154
Hey, are you sure you're good?

485
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:33,948
Oh, dude, I'm fine.

486
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,366
- Okay. Nice.
- Don't worry.

487
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:38,285
Getting tranq'd in the neck by Nick Fury,

488
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:40,162
probably the coolest thing
to ever happen to me.

489
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:41,455
- It is pretty awesome.
- Yeah.

490
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,707
- I'm happy I don't have to go to Prague.
- Seriously.

491
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:46,126
Good news. We're going to Prague.

492
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:48,879
- What?
- Prague?

493
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:51,966
Yeah. Tour company called.
They upgraded us.

494
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:55,010
You should've heard me on the phone
with them. I really gave them hell.

495
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:56,095
All I heard was crying.

496
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,181
- Look at our upgraded ride.
- Whoa, bro, you see that?

497
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:00,432
It's pretty sick.

498
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:04,061
- I'm impressed, Mr. Harrington.
- Oh, come on.

499
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:06,730
Peter, what--? What's going on?

500
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:11,026
I think Nick Fury just hijacked
our summer vacation.

501
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,446
I'm Mr. Harrington to the kids...

502
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,198
- Oh, all right.
- Okay.

503
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:17,574
Awesome.

504
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,452
Yeah. Awesome.

505
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:46,061
Yo, what's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, the Big F,

506
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:48,939
cruising through the Alps
with my private driver, Dimitri.

507
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:13,130
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.

508
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,923
Say EDITH."

509
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,054
<i>Stand by for retinal
and biometric scan.</i>

00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:23,015
- <i>Retinal and biometric scan accepted.</i>
- Hello?

511
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,558
<i>Hello, Peter.</i>

512
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:25,809
<i>I am EDITH,</i>

513
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:29,730
<i>Tony Starkys augmented-reality
security and defense system.</i>

514
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,523
- So he made you for me?
- <i>No.</i>

515
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:34,026
<i>But you have access
to all of Tony's protocols.</i>

516
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:36,820
- Cool.
- <i>Would you like to see what I can do?</i>

517
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:46,205
<i>EDITH stands for "Even dead,
I'm the hero."</i>

518
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,248
<i>Tony loved his acronyms.</i>

519
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:49,458
Yeah, he did.

520
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:52,628
<i>I have access to the entire
Stark Global Security network,</i>

521
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,755
<i>including multiple defense satellites,</i>

522
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:58,217
<i>as well as back doors
to all major telecommunication networks.</i>

523
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,433
Is MJ texting?

524
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:13,107
No. Don't look at it. Don't look at it.
That's wrong. That's wrong.

525
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:33,419
Petrol and toilets. Ten minutes!

526
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:35,421
Flash Mob, this is what
we doing out here...

527
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:37,631
Toilet, toilet, toilet.
Which way to the toilet?

528
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,341
Ten minutes, everyone.

529
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:42,636
Dimitri, where exactly are we?

530
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,057
- Okay. I'll figure it out.
- Oh, my gosh, it's so sick.

531
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:48,308
It's beautiful.

532
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:50,269
What?

533
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,616
Hello.

534
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,993
Close the door.

535
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,208
I'm Peter Parker.

536
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:14,626
Take off your clothes.

537
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,796
- Excuse me?
- You told Fury

538
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,257
Spider-Man cannot be seen in Europe.

539
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,426
So I made you this, another suit.

540
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,471
Oh, thank you.

541
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:29,349
- I'm sure it fits fine. I don't need to try--
- Take off your clothes.

542
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:30,642
Okay.

543
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:33,645
Sure.

544
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,774
- It's a little embarrassing.
- Now. Hurry up.

545
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:40,194
This is weird.

546
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:44,364
No, no, no. Don't--

547
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:51,663
- Sorry. I thought this was the bathroom.
- This is not what it looks like.

548
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:52,956
- Just--
- Yeah.

549
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,917
- What are you doing?
- I'll leave you alone.

550
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,795
Oh, my God. Don't shoot anybody.
Brad? It's not what it looks like, buddy.

551
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,298
- Hey, man, look, that's...
- Look, Peter,

552
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:03,383
I'm not here to judge
your life choices, dude.

553
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:06,762
If you want to hook up with some
random European chick, that's on you.

554
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,681
- That's not what that was.
- I can't pretend I didn't see what I saw.

555
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:12,059
I know you're trying
to get with MJ. It's obvious.

556
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:14,311
- But I like her too.
- Wait a minute. Hey, hey.

557
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:17,648
- You cannot show her that photo, dude.
- I'm sorry, man. I have to.

558
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:19,691
She deserves the truth.

559
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:23,111
Okay, put your one foot
in front of the other,

560
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:25,113
and, everybody, back on the bus.

561
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:27,157
It's been 10 minutes. Let's go!

562
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:34,248
What's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, Big F...

563
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:36,959
- EDITH?
- <i>Hello, Peter. How can I help you?</i>

564
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:40,003
Hey. There's this guy in my class
who's gonna ruin everything with MJ--

565
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:43,298
<i>Peter, l'm having difficulty hearing you.
Can you please speak up?</i>

566
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:46,301
Brad Davis. He has a photo of me.

567
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:48,428
<i>Brad Davis. Is he a target?</i>

568
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:49,888
Is Brad a target?

569
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:58,605
- Yeah. He's a target. He's a target.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

570
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:01,775
<i>Target is Brad Davis. Initiating strike.</i>

571
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:04,111
- Initiating what, now?
- <i>intercept point determined.</i>

572
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:06,071
- <i>Releasing kill vehicle.</i>
- EDITH.

573
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,805
- Oh, my God.
- Dope glasses, Parker.

574
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,016
- How'd you pay for these?
- Flash, give them back.

575
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,018
- I'm really paying you a compliment.
- Please give me--

576
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:38,520
I'm so sorry.

577
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:43,108
- EDITH, don't kill Brad.
- <i>Do you want me to cancel</i>

578
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,611
- <i>the drone strike on Brad Davis?</i>
- Did you punch Flash?

579
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,362
- No.
- <i>Firing.</i>

580
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:51,908
Oh, look out!

581
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:57,372
Hey, this is not the autobahn!

582
00:40:57,456 --> 00:40:58,832
- EDITH.
- Harrington!

583
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,126
- Is this the autobahn?
- Appears to be.

584
00:41:02,711 --> 00:41:04,463
- <i>Commencing second strike.</i>
- Peter.

585
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:07,549
- Plant your fanny and buckle up now.
- Look at the baby mountain goats!

586
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:09,801
- Baby mountain goats?
- I see them.

587
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:26,318
I don't see any mountain goats.

588
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:27,861
You missed them.

589
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,364
I know you think none of us
have noticed, Peter...

590
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:31,448
What?

591
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:34,368
...but your new look, I love it.

592
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,370
- Right, babe?
- Thanks.

593
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:39,373
Yeah. Sophisticated, classy,
very European.

594
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:40,415
Oh, man.

595
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,669
Let's try that again.

596
00:41:44,753 --> 00:41:47,047
This is so weird.
It was right here on my phone.

597
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,633
- I--
- Yeah. Weird.

598
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:22,040
- Whoa, freaking beautiful.
- This is amazing.

599
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:24,543
Wow, this place is so classy.

600
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:26,128
Yeah, so why are we here?

601
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:27,921
Speak for yourself.

602
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:29,548
I'm home.

603
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:31,216
What can I say?

604
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,552
The squeaky wheel gets
the upgrade grease.

605
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:37,264
Everyone get settled, rest up
because tonight, big surprise,

606
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:40,934
is Prague's annual Carnival of Lights.

607
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:42,269
- Yeah!
- Hello?

608
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:44,771
<i>Parker, it's Hill.
There's an earpiece with your suit.</i>

609
00:42:44,855 --> 00:42:47,190
<i>Put it on and await further instructions.
Understood?</i>

610
00:42:47,274 --> 00:42:48,108
Yes, ma'am.

611
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,484
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Hey, man.

612
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:51,820
- Hey.
- Look, I am so sorry

613
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,656
if I seem like I'm preoccupied
with my relationship.

614
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,868
- I'm still your guy in the chair.
- No, it's all good. Don't worry about it.

615
00:42:57,951 --> 00:43:00,662
- Okay. Great, great.
- It's fine.

616
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:03,081
So, what's the status
on the Elemental thing?

617
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:05,751
- Where's it gonna happen?
- Here in the city.

618
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:08,128
- We're here.
- I know. It's not good.

619
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:09,421
I'm figuring it out.

620
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:12,883
You have to do something, please.
We're counting on you.

621
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:14,551
- Ned.
- Yeah. Yeah, babe.

622
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:17,387
The good news is,
we've all got our own rooms.

623
00:43:17,471 --> 00:43:19,264
- It's about time.
- Serious?

624
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:20,974
<i>Parker? Parker!</i>

625
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:21,975
Yes, sir.

626
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:24,352
That thing is going to be here
in a few hours.

627
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:25,812
Are we boring you?

628
00:43:25,896 --> 00:43:28,398
He's not bored. He's thinking
about how you kidnapped him.

629
00:43:28,482 --> 00:43:30,025
He had obstacles.

630
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,985
I removed them.

631
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,904
They still won't evacuate the city.

632
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:36,072
Idiots.

633
00:43:36,907 --> 00:43:38,450
So, what's the plan, Parker?

634
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:42,370
I will be in the cathedral tower,
keeping watch for the fire monster.

635
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:45,248
When that shows up,
I will radio you guys,

636
00:43:45,332 --> 00:43:48,418
- and then Mr. Beck and I will--
- My name is Mysterio.

637
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,965
That's when Mysterio and I will move in.

638
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:55,383
Peter, listen to me.

639
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:58,053
The best hope you have, the only hope,

640
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:01,640
is to stop it here now,
no matter what the cost.

641
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:03,725
Maneuver it away
from civilians if you can,

642
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:06,686
but most important,
keep it away from metal.

643
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:10,315
If it gets too big, it'll draw power
from the Earth's core.

644
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:13,276
After that, there's no way to stop it.

645
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:19,366
Hey, my friends are here.

646
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:21,618
I can't help but think
we're putting them in danger.

647
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:24,788
You're worried about us
hurting your friends?

648
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:29,209
You, who called a drone strike
on your own school tour bus?

649
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:35,674
Stark gave you a multibillion-dollar
A.R. tactical intelligence system,

650
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:38,677
and the first thing you do with it is try
and blow up your friends.

651
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,765
It's clear to me
that you were not ready for this.

652
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:53,108
Fury asked me to come up here
and see how you were doing.

653
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,110
He just--
He felt bad about snapping at you.

654
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,236
Really?

655
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:59,155
You guys do have sarcasm
on this Earth, right?

656
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,033
How you feeling?

657
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:10,333
I didn't think I was gonna have
to save the world this summer.

658
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:12,836
I know that makes me sound
like such a jerk. I just...

659
00:45:14,296 --> 00:45:17,841
I had this plan with this girl
that I really like...

660
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:20,135
and now it's all ruined.

661
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,978
You're not a jerk
for wanting a normal life, kid.

662
00:45:32,105 --> 00:45:33,523
It's a hard path.

663
00:45:34,274 --> 00:45:37,360
You see things. You do things.
You make choices.

664
00:45:38,612 --> 00:45:40,322
People look up to you...

665
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:44,326
and even if you win a battle,
sometimes they die.

666
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:47,412
I like you, Peter. You're a good kid.

667
00:45:48,914 --> 00:45:52,667
There's a part of me
that wants me to tell you, just...

668
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:54,586
turn around, run away from all this.

669
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:58,673
Then there's another part of me
that knows what we're about to fight,

670
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:01,468
what's at stake,
and I'm glad you're here.

671
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:04,429
Me too.

672
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:06,806
But you're worried about your friends.

673
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:07,724
Yeah.

674
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:11,603
Just always feel like
I'm putting them in danger.

675
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:16,900
Look, just get them inside and keep them
in a safe place for just a few hours.

676
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:17,901
They'll be all right.

677
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:24,407
It's really nice to have somebody to talk to
about superhero stuff, you know?

678
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:26,868
Anytime.

679
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:32,040
And, hey, we survive this,
you'll have all summer to kill Brad.

680
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:37,045
See you out there.

681
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,129
All right.

682
00:46:43,385 --> 00:46:45,053
Sorry, that's Italian.

683
00:46:48,181 --> 00:46:51,434
Okay. EDITH? Oh, come on.

684
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:53,395
- <i>Hello, Peter.</i>
- Hey.

685
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:56,064
I need a way to keep my friends
inside the next few hours.

686
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,857
<i>Let's see what we can do.</i>

687
00:46:57,941 --> 00:46:59,609
Good news.

688
00:46:59,693 --> 00:47:01,277
We're going to the opera!

689
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:02,946
- You're kidding me.
- The opera?

690
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:05,615
- Don't look at me.
- What happened to the carnival?

691
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:07,158
This is upgrade living.

692
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:11,162
Come on. The tour company
just gave us these tickets.

693
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:14,207
For free! Do you have any idea
how much opera tickets cost?

694
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:18,670
No, because none of us have ever
wanted to go to the opera, ever.

695
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:21,715
I think this is gonna be
culturally enriching for us.

696
00:47:21,798 --> 00:47:23,299
Thank you, Ned.

697
00:47:23,383 --> 00:47:26,386
Everyone, this is gonna be, maybe,

698
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:29,264
the best four hours of our whole trip.

699
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:30,765
Four hours?

700
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:33,351
Guys, I think this is gonna be
really fun. Seriously.

701
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:39,024
I bet now you're all happy
I had you pack a nice outfit.

702
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:41,526
Yeah, because we'd much rather go
to a four-hour opera

703
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,570
instead of the biggest party in the world.

704
00:47:43,653 --> 00:47:45,447
Again, don't look at me.

705
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:48,033
<i>Parker, do you copy?</i>

706
00:47:48,116 --> 00:47:49,492
<i>Comm check, one, two.</i>

707
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:55,373
Okay, here we are. Beat the rush.

708
00:47:55,457 --> 00:47:57,000
Yeah, the rush out.

709
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:00,378
Lucky for us,
we got the best seats in the house.

710
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:02,505
Let's go.

711
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:05,967
Hey. I'll save you a seat.

712
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:16,519
- You look really pretty.
- And therefore, I have value?

713
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,481
No, that's not what
I meant at all. I was just--

714
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:21,066
I'm messing with you.

715
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:23,985
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

716
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:27,030
- You look pretty too.
- Thank you.

717
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,616
- Oh, my gosh! Opera glasses!
- So cute.

718
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:31,451
- Can I...?
- Yeah.

719
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:33,244
Want to go in on a pair?

720
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,664
- You mean, sit next to each other?
- Yeah.

721
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:38,500
<i>Are you in position?</i>

722
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,460
- No.
- Okay. No...

723
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:43,129
- <i>Why the hell not? Parker?</i>
- you don't want to sit next to me,

724
00:48:43,213 --> 00:48:46,883
- or, no, you just don't want the glasses?
- I didn't mean that.

725
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:49,385
If you go ahead, I'll go grab us a pair.

726
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:52,305
I'll save you a seat next to me.

727
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:55,100
- A lot of seats, so I'll be up there.
- Awesome.

728
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:56,976
Okay.

729
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,270
- <i>Parker.</i>
- No, I'm coming. I'm...

730
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:03,900
Hey, I gotta go. Could you tell MJ
that I'm sick or something?

731
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:06,194
Okay. Be careful.

732
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,487
And whatever you do,

733
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,323
please steer the monster away
from the opera house.

734
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:12,117
Yeah, Ned, I know.

735
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,159
- Okay.
- Okay?

736
00:49:13,243 --> 00:49:14,869
- Yeah.
- Gotta go.

737
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,846
<i>Parker! You better be on your way.</i>

738
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:33,972
Coming.

739
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:42,480
Where do you think she's going?
To the carnival?

740
00:49:42,564 --> 00:49:44,774
- Oh, I-- I don't--
- We should go. Yes, we should go.

741
00:49:44,858 --> 00:49:47,318
Come on, let's go. Come on.

742
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,837
All right. I'm in position.

743
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,340
As soon as I see something, Beck,
I'll-- I'll let you know.

744
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:11,509
<i>-Roger that.
- How's the suit?</i>

745
00:50:11,593 --> 00:50:12,844
The suit's great.

746
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:16,097
It's awesome. It's a little tight
around the old web-shooter.

747
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:18,141
- <i>Parker!</i>
- Okay, I'll shut up.

748
00:50:18,224 --> 00:50:20,727
Oh, my God, babe, isn't this beautiful?

749
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:23,146
Yeah, it's real beautiful, babe.

750
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:26,482
- What's wrong?
- You know, honestly, I just--

751
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:29,110
I don't do well with big crowds,
so maybe we should--

752
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:31,988
I have the perfect thing. Come on.

753
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,123
Don't worry, babe.

754
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:44,542
We'll get away from the crowds,
get some fresh air.

755
00:50:44,626 --> 00:50:46,252
You'll feel a thousand times better.

756
00:50:51,758 --> 00:50:53,927
- Energy spiking.
- We have seismic activity.

757
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:07,732
Okay, he's here! Beck, you ready?

758
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,901
- You know what to do.
- On your lead, Spider-Man.

759
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:17,325
No, come back!

760
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:19,035
Come back and help us!

761
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:26,960
You're up, kid.

762
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,307
Wait, wait. Is that...?

763
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:43,726
Do you think that's Spider-Man?

764
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:46,062
No, no, no.
It's a European rip-off version of him.

765
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:47,897
I actually read about him. It's not him.

766
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:03,496
No, Beck! He's got the carousel!

767
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:04,789
He's getting bigger!

768
00:52:05,415 --> 00:52:07,166
What's his name? What's his name?

769
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,835
It's Night-- Night Monkey.

770
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:10,336
- Night Monkey?
- Yeah.

771
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,963
- Yeah.
- Night Monkey!

772
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:14,048
- Yeah. Night Monkey.
- Night Monkey, help!

773
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:16,342
- Save us! Night Monkey, we're stuck!
- What?

774
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:18,177
- Oh, no, no.
- Help us! Help!

775
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,110
Are you okay?

776
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:39,324
On to Plan B?

777
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:41,826
Yeah! We gotta hit him
with something he can't absorb!

778
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:44,454
I go left, you go right! Now!

779
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:01,596
Okay, shoot him!

780
00:53:02,055 --> 00:53:02,972
Yeah!

781
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:07,435
That hurt him. Keep it coming.

782
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:17,612
<i>Spider-Man, keep your distance.</i>

783
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,530
<i>I'm trying!</i>

784
00:53:19,614 --> 00:53:21,532
<i>Can't let him get near the Ferris wheel.</i>

785
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:23,159
<i>Okay. I'm on it!</i>

786
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:47,642
Whoa, what is that?!

787
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:56,901
Betty! Betty!

788
00:54:17,547 --> 00:54:20,508
That's it! Nice! Nice! You got him!

789
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,766
No, no, no.

790
00:54:35,148 --> 00:54:36,357
It's too late.

791
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:39,694
Whatever happens...

792
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,404
I'm glad we met.

793
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:43,322
Beck, what are you doing?

794
00:54:44,574 --> 00:54:46,951
What I should have done last time.

795
00:54:51,831 --> 00:54:52,957
Beck, don't do it!

796
00:54:57,587 --> 00:54:58,713
Beck!

797
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:19,942
Mr. Beck?

798
00:55:23,279 --> 00:55:24,405
Oh, thank God.

799
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:37,210
I would kiss you,
but I think I threw up in my mouth a little.

800
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:42,340
I might have a mint.

801
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:45,092
So it's over?

802
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:46,928
That was the last of them.

803
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:50,097
But not the last threat we'll ever face.

804
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:53,768
We need to stay vigilant.

805
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:56,354
There's a void in this world
for someone like you.

806
00:55:56,437 --> 00:56:00,316
Hill and I are going to Europol
headquarters in Berlin tomorrow.

807
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:01,651
You should join us.

808
00:56:03,653 --> 00:56:06,447
Thank you.
I just might take you up on that.

809
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:19,961
You got gifts, Parker,
but you didn't wanna be here.

810
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:23,297
- Mr. Fury, I--
- I'd love to have you in Berlin too.

811
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:28,135
But you got to decide
whether you're going to step up or not.

812
00:56:29,262 --> 00:56:30,680
Stark chose you.

813
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:33,599
He made you an Avenger.

814
00:56:33,683 --> 00:56:35,601
I need that.

815
00:56:35,685 --> 00:56:37,979
The world needs that.

816
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:40,273
Maybe Stark was wrong.

817
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:44,860
Was he?

818
00:56:46,946 --> 00:56:48,447
The choice is yours.

819
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:04,505
Let's get a drink.

820
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:09,427
I'm not 21.

821
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:17,310
Hey.

822
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,898
You gotta celebrate.
We did something good tonight.

823
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:23,816
Yeah.

824
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:27,194
Fury was right.

825
00:57:27,278 --> 00:57:29,739
Tony did a lot for me...

826
00:57:29,822 --> 00:57:31,824
so I owe it to him, to everybody.

827
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:33,784
Do you?

828
00:57:33,868 --> 00:57:35,870
Yeah. I mean...

829
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:40,333
Mr. Stark gave me
the chance to be more.

830
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:42,251
He wanted me to be better than him.

831
00:57:42,335 --> 00:57:45,338
- And Fury wants me to live up to that.
- What do you want?

832
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,007
- What do you mean?
- What do you want?

833
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:52,637
- I don't know.
- What do you want? Peter Parker. Now.

834
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,473
- I know you're thinking about it.
- I wanna go on my trip.

835
00:57:55,556 --> 00:57:57,850
I want to go back on my trip
with my friends.

836
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:01,020
And go to the top of the Eiffel Tower

837
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:04,482
with the girl who I really like
and tell her how I feel...

838
00:58:06,233 --> 00:58:07,610
and give her a kiss.

839
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,320
Shut up, man.

840
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,573
- You're not gonna do that, are you?
- No, I can't.

841
00:58:12,657 --> 00:58:13,491
Why not?

842
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:15,576
Because I have too much
of a responsibility.

843
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:19,830
- My God. Thank you so much.
- What are those?

844
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:21,999
- Are those the--?
- EDITH glasses, yeah.

845
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:25,586
They were just on the floor? Try them on.
Let's see how they look on you.

846
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:26,671
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

847
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:32,218
I actually really like them.

848
00:58:32,301 --> 00:58:34,762
- Can I be completely honest with you?
- Please.

849
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,597
They look really stupid.

850
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:40,351
But maybe they have
a contact-lens version.

851
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:41,894
You try them on.

852
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:43,688
- No, come on.
- Try them on.

853
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:45,940
- I don't wanna try them on.
- Just put them on.

854
00:58:53,781 --> 00:58:55,157
What do you think, kid?

855
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:01,914
"Next Tony Stark, I trust you."

856
00:59:03,249 --> 00:59:05,626
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

857
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:06,585
What?

858
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,088
Stark left me a message
with those glasses:

859
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:11,006
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

860
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:13,676
I'm still not following.
How many lemonades have you had?

861
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:15,803
He knew every mistake I ever made.

862
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:18,222
He must've known I wasn't ready
for something like this.

863
00:59:18,305 --> 00:59:19,640
Why give it to you?

864
00:59:19,724 --> 00:59:23,686
Maybe he didn't trust me to have EDITH,
he just trusted me to pick who should.

865
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:26,063
It makes much more sense.
He knew I'd do what's right.

866
00:59:26,147 --> 00:59:29,608
And he's not gonna give them to Fury
because Fury would give himself EDITH.

867
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:31,110
You're probably right.

868
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:34,363
Right, so the world needs
the next Iron Man.

869
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:37,408
And it's not me.
I'm a 16-year-old kid from Queens.

870
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:40,327
It needs to be an adult
with some experience

871
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:43,372
and that's good like Tony Stark, like you.

872
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:46,500
No. Peter, come on. No.

873
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:50,171
- EDITH?
- <i>Hello, Peter.</i>

874
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:51,672
Hi. Yeah...

875
00:59:53,007 --> 00:59:55,926
I'd like to transfer your control
over to Quentin Beck.

876
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:58,345
- Peter, what are you doing?
- Doing the right thing.

877
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:02,808
- <i>Any transfer will require confirmation.</i>
- Stark gave you the glasses.

878
01:00:02,892 --> 01:00:06,312
Stark gave me a choice. It's my choice
to make, okay? And I'm gonna make it.

879
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:08,731
You're a soldier, a leader.
You stopped the Elementals.

880
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:11,817
You saved my life.
You saved the world, okay?

881
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:13,527
He'd want you to have them.

882
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:15,154
<i>Waiting for confirmation.</i>

883
01:00:15,237 --> 01:00:16,071
Confirm.

884
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:21,619
Welcome to the Avengers.

885
01:00:30,044 --> 01:00:31,170
They look good on you.

886
01:00:33,047 --> 01:00:33,881
Thank you.

887
01:00:34,507 --> 01:00:35,341
It's an honor.

888
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:36,926
Yeah.

889
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,679
Mr. Stark would've really liked you.

890
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:42,932
Where you headed?

891
01:00:43,015 --> 01:00:45,726
- I'm gonna go find MJ.
- Good luck, kid.

892
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:48,229
I'll give you a fifty-fifty chance.
You're pretty awkward.

893
01:00:49,647 --> 01:00:51,148
Yeah.

894
01:00:51,232 --> 01:00:52,983
- See you later, man.
- See you.

895
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:27,059
See? That wasn't so hard.

896
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:28,143
Yes!

897
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:32,147
Somebody get
this stupid costume off me!

898
01:01:39,655 --> 01:01:40,531
<i>Okay, we got EDITH.</i>

899
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,533
Get these connected to our system.

900
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:45,035
<i>Toast! Toast! Toast!</i>

901
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,705
No, this is a big win,
but we still got a lot of work to do.

902
01:01:47,788 --> 01:01:49,540
<i>Toast! Toast! Toast!</i>

903
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:51,333
Yeah!

904
01:01:51,417 --> 01:01:53,794
Okay, toasts!

905
01:01:53,878 --> 01:01:55,087
Give me that, Doug.

906
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:59,008
To the man who brought us all together,
our former boss, Tony Stark.

907
01:02:00,718 --> 01:02:02,094
The jester king.

908
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:06,682
Literally wrapped
in wealth and technology

909
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:08,726
that he was unfit to wield.

910
01:02:09,268 --> 01:02:11,145
Like the holographic system I designed.

911
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,939
A revolutionary breakthrough
with limitless applications

912
01:02:14,023 --> 01:02:16,233
that Tony turned
into a self-therapy machine

913
01:02:16,317 --> 01:02:17,151
and renamed--

914
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:20,779
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing,
or BARF.

915
01:02:24,033 --> 01:02:27,912
Oh, $611 million
for my little therapeutic experiment.

916
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:32,791
<i>He renamed my life's work "BARF."</i>

917
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:34,084
<i>I told him it was a mistake,</i>

918
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:36,337
that my technology could change
the world.

919
01:02:37,922 --> 01:02:38,839
And then...

920
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:41,300
he fired me.

921
01:02:42,635 --> 01:02:44,136
Said I was...

922
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:46,639
unstable.

923
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:51,060
- To Tony.
- To Tony!

924
01:02:51,936 --> 01:02:54,730
- Next, to William.
- William!

925
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:58,567
Tony Stark was able
to build this in a cave!

926
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:01,236
With a box of scraps!

927
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,197
The integration of my illusion tech

928
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,532
with your weaponized drones
was brilliant.

929
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:07,952
Powerful illusions, real damage,
worked like a charm.

930
01:03:08,035 --> 01:03:09,370
And it's just the beginning.

931
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:11,413
- Thank you, brother.
- To Guterman.

932
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:12,748
- Guterman!
- To Guterman!

933
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:15,834
The story you created of a soldier
from another Earth named Quentin

934
01:03:15,918 --> 01:03:19,088
fighting space monsters
in Europe is totally ridiculous

935
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:21,882
and apparently the kind of thing
people will believe right now.

936
01:03:21,966 --> 01:03:23,676
I mean, everybody bought it.

937
01:03:23,759 --> 01:03:25,177
- Gutes!
- Guterman!

938
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:27,429
- To Victoria.
- To Victoria!

939
01:03:27,513 --> 01:03:29,682
Staging electromagnetic pulses
at each attack site

940
01:03:29,765 --> 01:03:31,934
so Fury's own satellites
would confirm our lies.

941
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:33,394
Inspired idea.

942
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:35,896
- To Janice.
- Janice!

943
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:38,399
After Tony died, she was the one
who discovered that EDITH

944
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:42,361
was being handed over not to us,
not to the Defense Department,

945
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:43,404
but to a child.

946
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:45,072
- Thank you.
- To Janice!

947
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,992
And to the rest of you,
Tony Stark is gone.

948
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:50,995
There is a window of opportunity,
and someone will step up.

949
01:03:51,078 --> 01:03:53,539
But these days, you can be
the smartest guy in the room,

950
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:56,208
the most qualified, and no one cares.

951
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:59,712
Unless you're flying around with a cape
or shooting lasers from your hands,

952
01:03:59,795 --> 01:04:02,381
no one will even listen.

953
01:04:04,425 --> 01:04:07,803
Well, I've got a cape and lasers.

954
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:10,931
With our technology and with EDITH,

955
01:04:11,015 --> 01:04:15,894
Mysterio will be
the greatest hero on Earth!

956
01:04:15,978 --> 01:04:17,062
Yeah!

957
01:04:17,146 --> 01:04:19,815
Then everyone will listen!

958
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:26,155
- Not to a boozy man-child.
- No!

959
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:28,741
Not to a hormonal teenager.

960
01:04:28,824 --> 01:04:30,951
No!

961
01:04:31,035 --> 01:04:32,119
To me...

962
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:35,414
and to my very wealthy crew.

963
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:37,750
- To us.
- To us.

964
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:40,836
- To Mysterio!
- To Mysterio!

965
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:43,881
- To Peter Parker.
- To Peter Parker!

966
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:46,175
Poor kid.

967
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:49,136
Let's get to work.

968
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:55,350
- Peter, oh, my God.
- Hey. Hey.

969
01:04:55,434 --> 01:04:57,686
- We almost died.
- It's fine. It's fine.

970
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:59,521
Hey, I'm done with the mission.

971
01:04:59,605 --> 01:05:01,857
- Dude, the trip's over.
- What?

972
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:04,026
There's monsters coming out
of the ground.

973
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:05,819
Of course our parents want us home.

974
01:05:05,903 --> 01:05:08,697
Don't put me on hold.
Peter, you're not dead.

975
01:05:08,781 --> 01:05:12,576
Oh, my God. Yes, good.
Stay here. Don't-- Put some clothes on.

976
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:13,869
We're booking flights.

977
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:16,205
We came for science,
we're leaving because of witches.

978
01:05:16,288 --> 01:05:18,040
Welcome to the new Dark Ages.

979
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:22,461
- What is going on?
- We're going home in the morning.

980
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:24,838
No, no. All the Elementals are gone.

981
01:05:24,922 --> 01:05:26,799
- Ned.
- Coming, sweetie.

982
01:05:27,466 --> 01:05:30,177
Hey, can you guys keep it down?
I'm live-streaming.

983
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,430
- Yeah.
- Hey.

984
01:05:34,765 --> 01:05:36,809
- Hey.
- Where were you?

985
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:40,312
- I got lost.
- We were worried about you.

986
01:05:41,647 --> 01:05:44,066
- Good thing you're back.
- Yeah.

987
01:05:44,775 --> 01:05:47,528
- So much for Paris.
- It would've been fun.

988
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:50,280
- Yeah. Night.
- Night.

989
01:05:51,824 --> 01:05:53,117
You look ni--

990
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:01,625
Okay.

991
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:04,837
- Hey.
- Hey.

992
01:06:05,963 --> 01:06:06,797
Look...

993
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:12,761
I'm not ready for this trip to be over yet,
and I kind of want to do something fun

994
01:06:12,845 --> 01:06:16,765
that's not on the itinerary or planned
or with Mr. Harrington.

995
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:18,600
Yes.

996
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:20,811
"Yes," like you wanna go?

997
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:22,062
Yes.

998
01:06:23,397 --> 01:06:25,941
Awesome. I'll see you outside
in 10 minutes.

999
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:27,860
Meet me outside in five minutes.

1000
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:30,445
- Five is good.
- Okay.

1001
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:31,989
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

1002
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:38,912
<i>Night Monkey, help us!
Help! Night Monkey!</i>

1003
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:48,839
- Hey.
- Hey.

1004
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:50,299
Where do you wanna go?

1005
01:06:50,382 --> 01:06:52,134
- Who cares?
- Awesome.

1006
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:53,218
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1007
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:02,561
- I'm glad we're doing this.
- Yeah, me too.

1008
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:04,271
To see the city a bit.

1009
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:07,816
They used to execute people
on this bridge.

1010
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:11,820
They would put them in a basket,
and they would drown in the water.

1011
01:07:13,906 --> 01:07:15,866
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1012
01:07:19,286 --> 01:07:22,789
There's this thing I've been wanting
to talk to you about

1013
01:07:22,873 --> 01:07:24,791
for a while.

1014
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:27,586
Yeah?

1015
01:07:29,004 --> 01:07:30,631
It's our last night in Europe,

1016
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:34,718
and I had this plan
that I wanted to tell you.

1017
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:36,345
I'm just gonna tell you.

1018
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,641
- MJ, I--
- "I'm Spider-Man."

1019
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:43,936
- What?
- That's what you were gonna say.

1020
01:07:44,019 --> 01:07:45,062
That you're Spider-Man.

1021
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:49,524
No. I'm not Spider-Man.

1022
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:52,694
I've been watching you for a while now.

1023
01:07:52,778 --> 01:07:55,072
It's kind of obvious.

1024
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:57,282
I'm not Spider-Man.

1025
01:07:57,366 --> 01:07:59,785
What would make you think
that I was Spider-Man?

1026
01:07:59,868 --> 01:08:01,912
- Peter, Washington?
- Yeah?

1027
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:05,624
The fact that you disappear
out of nowhere for no reason.

1028
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:08,669
No, I was sick. Remember?
I had my-- The tummy?

1029
01:08:08,752 --> 01:08:10,420
Susan Yang thinks you're a male escort.

1030
01:08:10,504 --> 01:08:12,839
What? Of course I'm not a male escort.

1031
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:15,926
- Then you're Spider-Man.
- I'm not Spider-Man at all.

1032
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:19,346
What about tonight? You snuck off,
and you fought that thing. I saw you.

1033
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,848
You can't have seen me
because I'm not Spider-Man.

1034
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:24,434
Also, on the news,
it was the Night Monkey.

1035
01:08:24,518 --> 01:08:25,978
- The Night Monkey?
- Yeah.

1036
01:08:26,061 --> 01:08:28,063
That's what it said on the news,

1037
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:30,482
and the news never lies.

1038
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:34,653
- Night Monkey. Okay.
- What are you doing?

1039
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:39,992
Well, do the Night Monkey
and Spider-Man use the same webs?

1040
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:42,411
I mean, maybe.

1041
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:45,080
Maybe he's a Spider Monkey.
Who knows?

1042
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:52,087
Were you only watching me
because you thought I was Spider-Man?

1043
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:56,425
Yeah.

1044
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,761
Why else would I be watching you?

1045
01:09:01,847 --> 01:09:04,558
Doesn't matter. Just thought that maybe--

1046
01:09:10,689 --> 01:09:12,107
What the hell was that?

1047
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:14,985
I don't know.

1048
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:28,749
What is it, some kind of projector
or something?

1049
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:32,127
Yeah, but it's really advanced.

1050
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:34,504
It-- It looked so real.

1051
01:09:34,588 --> 01:09:36,965
- It...
- Yeah, really real.

1052
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:41,053
- Wait, does that mean that--?
- The Elementals are fake?

1053
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:44,598
That doesn't make any sense
because we were there, right?

1054
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:47,726
There was fire and destruction, and...

1055
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:50,687
Who would do something like that?

1056
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:01,782
Mysterio.

1057
01:10:06,745 --> 01:10:08,121
I am Spider-Man.

1058
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:12,918
- And I've really messed up.
- Wait. You're being serious?

1059
01:10:13,752 --> 01:10:16,046
You're 100 percent serious?
Because it's not funny.

1060
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:17,047
No, I'm not joking.

1061
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:19,341
Because I was--
I was only like 67 percent sure.

1062
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:21,301
- MJ--
- So why are you here?

1063
01:10:21,385 --> 01:10:24,346
- Why are you on this school trip?
- I know you have a lot of questions,

1064
01:10:24,429 --> 01:10:26,181
but we have to get out of here, okay?

1065
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:29,393
Okay. Okay. I can't believe I figured it out!

1066
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:33,313
You took everything from me!

1067
01:10:34,523 --> 01:10:36,066
This is for my family!

1068
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:43,907
Pause.

1069
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:46,701
Pause.

1070
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:49,121
Sorry.

1071
01:10:49,538 --> 01:10:52,124
Yeah, can you just fast-forward
to the end?

1072
01:10:52,207 --> 01:10:53,250
Yep. Stand by.

1073
01:10:57,921 --> 01:11:00,799
All right, fly, fly, fly, zap, zap, zap.

1074
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:04,386
Pause. I'm not in love
with this choreography, but it'll do.

1075
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:05,929
Kill image.

1076
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:07,347
De-cloak drones.

1077
01:11:09,057 --> 01:11:10,225
All right, weapons.

1078
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,561
- You want to weaponize?
- Yep.

1079
01:11:12,644 --> 01:11:14,396
Weapons only. Stand by.

1080
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:25,574
- Nice.
- Stop.

1081
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,327
Something. I don't know what it is.
It's something--

1082
01:11:29,411 --> 01:11:33,874
Just dou-- You know what?
Double the damage and then run it again.

1083
01:11:33,957 --> 01:11:35,459
You want me to double it up?

1084
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:36,918
- Yeah.
- All right.

1085
01:11:37,294 --> 01:11:38,295
Cover your ears.

1086
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,514
That is good! That's good.

1087
01:11:50,432 --> 01:11:52,142
- We on schedule?
- Oh, yeah.

1088
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:54,728
Uploading software hack
to EDITH network.

1089
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:58,231
With her drones, we'll create an event
big enough to cover an entire city.

1090
01:11:58,315 --> 01:11:59,232
All right, well done.

1091
01:11:59,316 --> 01:12:01,902
Make sure every drone is weapons-hot.
We need maximum damage.

1092
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:04,446
- That is gonna cause a lot of casualties.
- Oh, yeah.

1093
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:07,199
More casualties, more coverage.
I gotta cut through the static.

1094
01:12:07,282 --> 01:12:10,327
London is a beautiful city,
and it will suffer, but they can rebuild.

1095
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,037
If I'm the next Iron Man,

1096
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:15,332
I need to save the world
from an Avengers-level threat.

1097
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:19,669
But when its new savior descends,

1098
01:12:19,753 --> 01:12:22,297
all those casualties will be forgotten.

1099
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:26,176
Janice, you'll be in position with my
quick-change armor for the victory lap?

1100
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:27,719
Of course. Do you wanna try--?

1101
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:29,721
No, no, that's--
What's going on with my hand?

1102
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:31,139
Why is that happening?

1103
01:12:31,223 --> 01:12:34,518
Oh, one of the drones that came back
from the plaza was missing a projector.

1104
01:12:34,601 --> 01:12:35,435
It's fine.

1105
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:38,939
Wait, and you're--?
You're telling me this now?

1106
01:12:39,648 --> 01:12:41,274
It's-- It's one drone.

1107
01:12:41,358 --> 01:12:44,194
- The image will be perfect, I promise.
- That projector is evidence.

1108
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:47,322
It's going to tell people what we're doing
and how we're doing it.

1109
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:51,076
I am trying to fool 7 billion people here,
including Nick Fury,

1110
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:54,621
who happens to be the most paranoid
and most dangerous person on the planet.

1111
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:57,916
If he catches on before I've killed him,
he will put a bullet in my head.

1112
01:12:57,999 --> 01:13:00,335
And nobody wants a bullet
in their head, right?

1113
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:03,505
Right?

1114
01:13:06,091 --> 01:13:07,968
William, can you look at me?

1115
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:11,263
Pull up EDITH.

1116
01:13:13,223 --> 01:13:14,224
<i>Hello, Quentin.</i>

1117
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:18,144
Hi, honey. I need a level-five search,
full-resource protocol for this device.

1118
01:13:18,228 --> 01:13:19,271
<i>Magnifying.</i>

1119
01:13:20,522 --> 01:13:22,983
There. Search everything going in
and out of that building.

1120
01:13:24,109 --> 01:13:25,068
<i>Located.</i>

1121
01:13:26,778 --> 01:13:27,737
Shit.

1122
01:13:30,991 --> 01:13:33,034
You know, William, one day,

1123
01:13:33,118 --> 01:13:35,579
after I've had to kill Peter Parker
because of this,

1124
01:13:35,662 --> 01:13:39,958
I hope you remember
that his blood is on your hands!

1125
01:13:43,295 --> 01:13:46,464
I can't believe I gave Beck those glasses.
How could I be that stupid?

1126
01:13:46,548 --> 01:13:50,218
He's probably spying on me right now
or sending a drone to come and kill me.

1127
01:13:50,302 --> 01:13:52,929
You had access to killer drones?

1128
01:13:53,013 --> 01:13:56,391
Yeah, I didn't really want them,
especially after I almost killed Brad.

1129
01:13:56,474 --> 01:13:58,018
You almost killed Brad?

1130
01:13:58,101 --> 01:14:02,022
Look, I have to call Mr. Fury
and tell him that Beck's a fraud...

1131
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:05,233
- but I think he tapped my phone.
- So, what are you gonna do?

1132
01:14:05,317 --> 01:14:08,153
I need my suit, and I have to go to Berlin

1133
01:14:08,236 --> 01:14:10,071
and talk to Mr. Fury in person.

1134
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:15,785
Just...

1135
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:36,806
Oh, Ned, perfect.

1136
01:14:36,890 --> 01:14:38,975
The costume looks great...

1137
01:14:39,893 --> 01:14:43,897
for the costume party
at the prince's castle.

1138
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,440
She knows. I told her.

1139
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:47,776
He didn't tell me. I figured it out.

1140
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:52,697
- That's cool.
- Like, a long time ago.

1141
01:14:54,366 --> 01:14:58,370
- Look, Mysterio is a fraud.
- But he saved me and Betty's lives.

1142
01:14:58,453 --> 01:15:00,664
He's been faking the whole thing
with illusion tech.

1143
01:15:00,747 --> 01:15:03,667
Yeah, he's using these, like,
hologram projectors.

1144
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:05,877
That's crazy.

1145
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,045
Yeah.

1146
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:12,300
So you guys were working
the case together or what?

1147
01:15:12,384 --> 01:15:13,343
It's been mostly me.

1148
01:15:14,219 --> 01:15:16,763
Ned, I need you to call May,
get her to call Mr. Harrington,

1149
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:19,182
say she wanted me to stay
with family in Berlin, okay?

1150
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:20,600
Got it. Easy.

1151
01:15:20,684 --> 01:15:23,353
Wow, you guys lie with such ease.

1152
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:26,940
- I gotta go.
- Wait, wait, wait. The projector.

1153
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:28,441
You're gonna need this.

1154
01:15:29,693 --> 01:15:32,862
Don't tell anyone about this, okay?
Anyone who knows is in danger.

1155
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:42,914
So you know too.

1156
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:44,040
It's cool.

1157
01:15:44,124 --> 01:15:47,335
I've known first, and I've known longer,
but it's not a competition.

1158
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:11,276
- Excuse me. Do you know where--?
- <i>Nacht</i> Monkey!

1159
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:13,695
No, wait, I didn't-- Oh, man.

1160
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:17,782
Get in.

1161
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:27,333
- Mr. Fury--
- You've got a lot of explaining to do.

1162
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:29,586
- No, no, no, listen.
- Wait until we're secure.

1163
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:31,254
Okay.

1164
01:16:36,843 --> 01:16:37,802
Right.

1165
01:17:03,203 --> 01:17:07,415
So is there anything you want
to tell us about your girlfriend?

1166
01:17:07,499 --> 01:17:09,000
He's talking about EDITH.

1167
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:12,170
I know I made a mistake, and I'm sorry,
but he is not who you think he is.

1168
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:15,173
Beck is a liar.
Mysterio, the Elementals, it's all fake.

1169
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:16,758
He has some sort of illusion tech.

1170
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:19,511
That's how he tricked you
and tricked me into giving him EDITH.

1171
01:17:20,053 --> 01:17:23,389
It's a projector. I pulled it off
the fire monster in Prague.

1172
01:17:23,723 --> 01:17:27,060
So all that death
and destruction we witnessed

1173
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:28,770
was created by this?

1174
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:30,980
No, not just this.
I think he's using drones.

1175
01:17:31,523 --> 01:17:36,236
Well, if this is true, then Beck's
very dangerous and we need to be smart.

1176
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:37,987
Who else did you tell about this?

1177
01:17:38,905 --> 01:17:41,157
Parker? Parker!

1178
01:17:41,241 --> 01:17:43,743
- What's wrong?
- It's Beck. He's here.

1179
01:17:44,369 --> 01:17:46,412
What? Hill?

1180
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,127
No, it's just an illu--

1181
01:17:54,379 --> 01:17:55,421
Fury!

1182
01:18:00,552 --> 01:18:03,096
<i>Wow, Peter, wow.</i>

1183
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:05,223
<i>I thought we were close.</i>

1184
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:08,852
<i>Fury always had to die, but not you.</i>

1185
01:18:08,935 --> 01:18:10,061
Stop hiding, Beck!

1186
01:18:12,814 --> 01:18:14,816
<i>I tried to help you walk away.</i>

1187
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,901
<i>Now you're making me do this.</i>

1188
01:18:21,573 --> 01:18:24,284
<i>You told me, you were just a kid.</i>

1189
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:28,705
<i>You told me, you wanted
to run after that girl.</i>

1190
01:18:28,788 --> 01:18:30,748
- Help me!
- MJ!

1191
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:32,917
Oh, God!

1192
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:38,047
- Peter, what's going on?
- I know this isn't real.

1193
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:39,382
<i>Do you, though?</i>

1194
01:18:41,009 --> 01:18:43,386
MJ! MJ!

1195
01:18:46,848 --> 01:18:49,350
<i>I don't think you know what's real, Peter.</i>

1196
01:19:02,614 --> 01:19:03,907
<i>You need to wake up!</i>

1197
01:19:27,221 --> 01:19:29,349
<i>I mean, look at yourself.</i>

1198
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:43,780
<i>You are just a scared little kid
in a sweat suit.</i>

1199
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:49,661
<i>I created Mysterio to give the world
someone to believe in.</i>

1200
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,537
<i>I control the truth.</i>

1201
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:54,374
<i>Mysterio is the truth.</i>

1202
01:20:17,981 --> 01:20:21,901
<i>If you were good enough,
maybe Tony would still be alive.</i>

1203
01:20:34,664 --> 01:20:37,875
<i>Deep down, you know I'm right.</i>

1204
01:20:49,012 --> 01:20:53,433
<i>You made your choice.
And all you had to do was step aside.</i>

1205
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:57,478
<i>And now you have--</i>

1206
01:21:09,407 --> 01:21:10,908
Fury.

1207
01:21:10,992 --> 01:21:15,621
Beck's people are trying to find
everyone who could expose him.

1208
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:17,749
Who'd you tell?

1209
01:21:18,249 --> 01:21:20,668
I know you told someone, so just tell me.

1210
01:21:20,752 --> 01:21:22,462
- Okay.
- Who did you tell?

1211
01:21:22,545 --> 01:21:25,798
- Who else did you tell?!
- Just Ned and MJ from my class.

1212
01:21:25,882 --> 01:21:28,217
Maybe Ned told his girlfriend Betty,
but that's it.

1213
01:21:29,761 --> 01:21:30,720
What?

1214
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:33,473
You are so gullible.

1215
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:35,600
- What?
- You're smart as a whip.

1216
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:36,934
Just a...

1217
01:21:38,061 --> 01:21:38,936
sucker.

1218
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:42,273
- And now all your friends have to die.
- Oh, my God.

1219
01:21:47,028 --> 01:21:50,031
It's easy to fool people
when they're already fooling themselves.

1220
01:21:55,453 --> 01:21:57,038
But for what it's worth, Peter,

1221
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:00,083
I really am sorry.

1222
01:22:09,634 --> 01:22:11,010
- EDITH.
- <i>Yes, Quentin.</i>

1223
01:22:11,094 --> 01:22:13,596
Access files to Peter Parker's class trip.

1224
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:16,599
I need them to fly home from London.

1225
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:57,140
Hi.

1226
01:22:58,474 --> 01:22:59,517
Where am I?

1227
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:01,978
Municipal holding facility.

1228
01:23:02,061 --> 01:23:05,773
They said they found you unconscious
at the train yard. Very dangerous.

1229
01:23:05,857 --> 01:23:09,110
And we gave you the shirt
because you seemed a bit cold.

1230
01:23:09,569 --> 01:23:10,403
Thanks.

1231
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:13,906
You guys are nice.

1232
01:23:15,241 --> 01:23:17,076
You speak really good English.

1233
01:23:17,577 --> 01:23:18,953
Welcome to the Netherlands.

1234
01:23:19,996 --> 01:23:22,331
- I'm in the Netherlands right now?
- Yep.

1235
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:25,835
Bye.

1236
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:26,919
Guard!

1237
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:29,630
The guard is on a break.
Probably talking to his wife.

1238
01:23:29,714 --> 01:23:31,632
- Yeah, she's pregnant.
- Oh, yeah?

1239
01:23:31,716 --> 01:23:32,592
Yeah.

1240
01:23:40,558 --> 01:23:41,642
Yeah.

1241
01:23:42,393 --> 01:23:43,519
Yeah.

1242
01:23:44,145 --> 01:23:45,938
Night Monkey. Yeah.

1243
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:51,944
You guys okay?

1244
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:05,875
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

1245
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:08,169
- Could I borrow your phone?
- Yeah.

1246
01:24:09,587 --> 01:24:11,088
Everyone is so nice here.

1247
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:13,424
Okay.

1248
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:19,597
Okay.

1249
01:24:21,599 --> 01:24:23,976
Pick up, pick up, pick up. Hey, hey...

1250
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:28,147
I messed up. I need a-- I need a ride.

1251
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,692
Where am I? Where am I, sir?

1252
01:24:31,776 --> 01:24:33,361
It's Broek op Langedijk.

1253
01:24:35,863 --> 01:24:37,907
Hang on. Could you say that into there?

1254
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:40,952
Hi. It's Broek op Langedijk here.

1255
01:24:41,953 --> 01:24:43,913
Yeah, no problem.

1256
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:45,539
Thanks.

1257
01:24:45,623 --> 01:24:46,624
Did you get that?

1258
01:25:08,062 --> 01:25:10,564
Peter? Are you okay?

1259
01:25:10,648 --> 01:25:13,442
- Happy, is that you?
- Yeah, of course it's me.

1260
01:25:13,526 --> 01:25:17,029
Stop! Tell me something
only you would know.

1261
01:25:17,488 --> 01:25:18,698
Only I would know...

1262
01:25:19,949 --> 01:25:21,742
Remember when we went to Germany?

1263
01:25:21,826 --> 01:25:23,661
You pay-per-viewed a video
in your room?

1264
01:25:23,744 --> 01:25:27,540
They didn't list the titles, but I could tell
by the price it was an adult film.

1265
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:30,459
- And you didn't know how I knew--
- Okay, fine! It's you. Stop.

1266
01:25:33,546 --> 01:25:35,006
It's so good to see you.

1267
01:25:36,507 --> 01:25:38,759
You'll have to tell me
what the hell is going on here.

1268
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,595
Okay, hold still.

1269
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:42,888
There we go.

1270
01:25:49,312 --> 01:25:50,396
Ouch.

1271
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:53,441
- I thought you had super strength.
- It still hurts.

1272
01:25:55,943 --> 01:25:58,070
- Happy, come on.
- All right, relax.

1273
01:26:00,031 --> 01:26:02,116
- Just a few more. There we go.
- Oh, my God, Happy.

1274
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:03,909
- Relax.
- Don't tell me to relax, Happy!

1275
01:26:03,993 --> 01:26:06,412
How can I relax
when I messed up so bad?

1276
01:26:07,246 --> 01:26:09,415
I trusted Beck. Right?

1277
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:13,461
I thought he was my friend. I gave him
the only thing Mr. Stark left for me,

1278
01:26:13,544 --> 01:26:15,796
and now he's gonna kill my friends
and half of Europe,

1279
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:18,466
so please do not tell me to relax.

1280
01:26:20,468 --> 01:26:23,220
I'm sorry, Happy. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't shout.

1281
01:26:26,265 --> 01:26:27,725
I just really miss him.

1282
01:26:28,934 --> 01:26:30,186
Yeah, I miss him too.

1283
01:26:33,314 --> 01:26:34,732
Everywhere I go...

1284
01:26:35,983 --> 01:26:37,443
I see his face.

1285
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:42,031
And the whole world is asking
who's gonna be the next Iron Man...

1286
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:48,079
and I don't know if that's me, Happy.
I'm not Iron Man.

1287
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:51,332
You're not Iron Man.

1288
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,251
You're never gonna be Iron Man.

1289
01:26:56,212 --> 01:26:58,506
Nobody could live up to Tony.

1290
01:26:58,589 --> 01:27:00,091
Not even Tony.

1291
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,511
Tony was my best friend.

1292
01:27:03,594 --> 01:27:04,720
And he was a mess.

1293
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:08,307
He second-guessed everything he did.
He was all over the place.

1294
01:27:09,225 --> 01:27:12,144
The one thing that he did that he didn't
second-guess was picking you.

1295
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:17,775
I don't think
Tony would have done what he did

1296
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:20,945
if he didn't know that you were
gonna be here after he was gone.

1297
01:27:22,905 --> 01:27:27,243
Now, your friends are in trouble,
you're all alone, your tech is missing.

1298
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:30,746
What are you gonna do about it?

1299
01:27:36,335 --> 01:27:37,753
I'm gonna kick his ass.

1300
01:27:37,837 --> 01:27:40,840
But I mean, right now.
Specifically, what are we gonna do?

1301
01:27:40,923 --> 01:27:43,884
Because we've been hovering over
a tulip field for the last 15 minutes.

1302
01:27:43,968 --> 01:27:46,887
Right. I can't call my friends
because he's tracking their phones.

1303
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:48,556
Give me your phone.

1304
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:49,890
- My cell phone?
- Yeah.

1305
01:27:49,974 --> 01:27:51,475
Okay. Here.

1306
01:27:51,559 --> 01:27:53,894
- What's your password?
- "Password."

1307
01:27:53,978 --> 01:27:57,189
- No, what is your password?
- "Password," spelled out.

1308
01:27:57,273 --> 01:27:59,442
Head of security,
and your password is "password"?

1309
01:27:59,525 --> 01:28:00,860
I don't feel good about it either.

1310
01:28:00,943 --> 01:28:03,988
<i>Hello, governor. Cup of tea for you?
I'm gonna be in London soon.</i>

1311
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:06,073
- They're in London.
- London, okay.

1312
01:28:06,157 --> 01:28:08,159
- Yeah, I need a suit.
- Suit?

1313
01:28:29,847 --> 01:28:30,681
Okay...

1314
01:28:31,891 --> 01:28:34,393
bring up everything you have
on Spider-Man.

1315
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:44,195
Yeah, open that. Okay, no, no, no.

1316
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:52,244
What?

1317
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:54,330
Nothing.

1318
01:28:54,413 --> 01:28:56,916
You take care of the suit.
I'll take care of the music.

1319
01:29:00,878 --> 01:29:03,005
Oh, I love Led Zeppelin.

1320
01:29:08,427 --> 01:29:10,679
Okay, can you pull up my web-shooters?

1321
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:15,976
Isolate the Taser webs,
and reconfigure and boost the voltage

1322
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:19,104
to a factor of 25 percent,

1323
01:29:19,188 --> 01:29:21,982
and give me complete manual control
over detonation.

1324
01:29:25,194 --> 01:29:28,197
I thought Kree having sleeper cells
was top secret information.

1325
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:31,158
Nick, satellites are picking up
an EM pulse.

1326
01:29:31,242 --> 01:29:33,744
- I thought that was over.
- It's the biggest one yet.

1327
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:35,579
- Where?
- London.

1328
01:29:35,663 --> 01:29:38,082
Okay, the company set up a city tour,

1329
01:29:38,165 --> 01:29:41,210
and then we'll grab a bite
and head to the airport.

1330
01:29:43,629 --> 01:29:45,923
Is no one else going
to acknowledge how crazy this is?

1331
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:47,299
Oh, yeah, I get it.

1332
01:29:47,383 --> 01:29:50,010
There's been nothing scientific
about this science tour at all.

1333
01:29:50,094 --> 01:29:51,762
No, I'm talking about Peter.

1334
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:53,931
Has no one noticed how shady he is?

1335
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:56,725
Because I saw him in the back room
of a rest stop with some woman

1336
01:29:56,809 --> 01:29:59,228
in his underwear,
and he's always sneaking away,

1337
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:01,188
like back at the opera, huh?

1338
01:30:01,272 --> 01:30:04,650
Now he's suddenly off the trip,
with his family in Berlin?

1339
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:07,194
Is no one else interested in the truth?

1340
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:12,366
"The very concept of objective truth
is fading out of the world."

1341
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:13,492
George Orwell.

1342
01:30:13,576 --> 01:30:14,827
- Thank you, MJ.
- Yeah.

1343
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:19,540
Well, since Peter's not really here
to tell his truth, what about you, Brad?

1344
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:21,875
Why take pictures of people
in the bathroom?

1345
01:30:21,959 --> 01:30:23,627
Yeah, what's that about?

1346
01:30:23,711 --> 01:30:26,422
No, no, no, it wasn't like that. It was--

1347
01:30:26,505 --> 01:30:29,675
- I was trying to take a--
- Let's just put all this craziness behind us

1348
01:30:29,758 --> 01:30:32,553
and have a nice, peaceful afternoon.

1349
01:30:32,636 --> 01:30:35,264
"Sounds great, Mr. Harrington,"
said the class.

1350
01:30:35,347 --> 01:30:36,599
Okay.

1351
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:39,685
I'm gonna be a cool teacher right now.

1352
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:42,271
You gotta stop doing that. It is weird.

1353
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:46,025
No more photos in the bathroom.
Urinal or stalls.

1354
01:30:46,108 --> 01:30:47,651
- Okay?
- Look at this, guys.

1355
01:30:47,735 --> 01:30:49,278
Mr. Harrington, this is your bus.

1356
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:52,823
- We got a bus all to ourselves.
- Nice to see you all. Come along.

1357
01:30:52,906 --> 01:30:54,950
- I'll get this, yeah? Why not?
- Thank you.

1358
01:30:55,034 --> 01:30:56,994
Yeah. Thank you, brother.

1359
01:30:57,077 --> 01:30:58,871
All right.

1360
01:30:58,954 --> 01:31:00,706
I have the kids.

1361
01:31:04,585 --> 01:31:06,086
I got here as fast as I could.

1362
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:09,590
I did a full perimeter sweep. Nothing.

1363
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:10,507
Damn it.

1364
01:31:13,052 --> 01:31:14,178
Pulse is spiking.

1365
01:31:14,261 --> 01:31:17,473
- I'll take another look.
- Soon as you see something, report.

1366
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:19,850
<i>You're all we've got, Beck.</i>

1367
01:31:19,933 --> 01:31:22,645
If this is what I fear,
then God help us, Fury.

1368
01:31:23,854 --> 01:31:25,064
God help us all.

1369
01:31:26,607 --> 01:31:28,567
Okay, people, no Avengers coming.
Good to go.

1370
01:31:28,651 --> 01:31:31,487
- <i>William, launch the drones.</i>
- Copy that, brother.

1371
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:35,240
<i>Drones are entering
the atmosphere weapons-hot.</i>

1372
01:31:40,788 --> 01:31:43,290
- Excellent. Janice?
- Working on the cape.

1373
01:31:43,374 --> 01:31:46,043
Get those wrinkles out. I could be
shaking hands with the queen.

1374
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:47,628
- <i>Guterman?</i>
- Almost in position.

1375
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:50,297
- Okay. Hit it, Victoria.
- Increasing pulse.

1376
01:31:52,257 --> 01:31:55,386
Whatever this thing is, it's 100 times
bigger than the previous ones.

1377
01:31:55,469 --> 01:31:56,720
EDITH?

1378
01:31:56,804 --> 01:31:58,347
<i>Yes, Quentin.</i>

1379
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:00,140
Show me my loose ends.

1380
01:32:00,891 --> 01:32:03,769
Once the show's going,
execute the kill order on my command.

1381
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:05,020
- <i>Copy.</i>
- All right.

1382
01:32:05,104 --> 01:32:06,188
Start the show.

1383
01:32:08,148 --> 01:32:10,234
Let's save the world, people.

1384
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:14,363
I don't like this. Something's definitely up.

1385
01:32:15,406 --> 01:32:18,492
You're an FOS now.
"Friend of Spider-Man."

1386
01:32:18,575 --> 01:32:21,036
And you have to remember,
just stay calm.

1387
01:32:25,165 --> 01:32:26,667
That doesn't look good.

1388
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,711
But it's fake,
there's nothing to worry about.

1389
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:32,923
And the kids are in the kill zone.

1390
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:34,383
<i>Great work, Guterman.</i>

1391
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:39,179
- What?
- <i>Happy Hogan here.</i>

1392
01:32:39,263 --> 01:32:41,348
- I know. What do you want?
- <i>Over at Mr. Stark's,</i>

1393
01:32:41,432 --> 01:32:43,058
<i>going through his belongings.</i>

1394
01:32:43,142 --> 01:32:45,144
- <i>There was a surfboard you left behind.</i>
- What?

1395
01:32:45,227 --> 01:32:47,771
<i>People there said they didn't think
Nick Fury was a surfer, but I said:</i>

1396
01:32:47,855 --> 01:32:52,443
- <i>"Appearances can be deceiving."</i>
- It's not mine. And don't ever call again.

1397
01:33:00,367 --> 01:33:04,538
Fury's got the coded message.
Your friends are at the Tower Bridge.

1398
01:33:04,621 --> 01:33:06,915
Your boy called it London Bridge,
but I figured it out.

1399
01:33:06,999 --> 01:33:09,126
- I'll scoop them up, okay?
- Yeah.

1400
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:10,335
- We're close.
- We're close.

1401
01:33:10,419 --> 01:33:11,795
- How's the suit?
- Almost done.

1402
01:33:11,879 --> 01:33:13,964
- Good.
- Wait, wait, whoa, whoa. Before you go...

1403
01:33:14,965 --> 01:33:17,509
if something happens to me,
could you please give this to MJ?

1404
01:33:17,593 --> 01:33:19,762
You'll make it back.
You'll give it to her yourself.

1405
01:33:19,845 --> 01:33:21,221
- Okay? You got this.
- I got this.

1406
01:33:21,305 --> 01:33:24,141
- Walk me through it.
- I know it's illusion tech.

1407
01:33:24,224 --> 01:33:27,144
All I have to do is get inside the illusion,
then I can take it down,

1408
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:30,189
find him, and he's just a guy,
so I can take EDITH right back.

1409
01:33:30,272 --> 01:33:32,691
Right, but last time, you got hit by a train.

1410
01:33:33,150 --> 01:33:35,861
True, but this time--

1411
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:38,781
How do I explain this?
I have a sixth sense.

1412
01:33:38,864 --> 01:33:42,409
The Peter-tingle.
That's what you're talking about, right?

1413
01:33:42,493 --> 01:33:43,702
It's not working, though.

1414
01:33:43,786 --> 01:33:46,538
- I heard it wasn't working right now. Is it?
- It is working.

1415
01:33:46,622 --> 01:33:49,166
- I don't know if it's working--
- So you got the Peter-tingle.

1416
01:33:49,249 --> 01:33:51,502
That's the plan.
I'm gonna go get your friends.

1417
01:33:51,585 --> 01:33:54,880
- You get that Peter-tingle back online.
- I got this.

1418
01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:12,231
- Cue the lightning.
- Cuing lightning.

1419
01:34:17,444 --> 01:34:21,698
Sir, is it still safe on the top,
or should we all come down?

1420
01:34:21,782 --> 01:34:22,783
Oh, my.

1421
01:34:24,618 --> 01:34:27,621
- What did the bus driver say?
- Bus driver's gone.

1422
01:34:27,704 --> 01:34:29,039
- What?!
- Where?!

1423
01:34:29,122 --> 01:34:31,959
It's okay. Mr. Dell and I have it
under control!

1424
01:34:32,042 --> 01:34:36,255
- Oh, no. Don't drag me into this, Roger.
- I'm doing my best, Julius!

1425
01:34:36,338 --> 01:34:38,674
- Look--
- Oh, the witches are back.

1426
01:34:38,757 --> 01:34:40,592
Oh, my God, get off the bus!

1427
01:34:45,889 --> 01:34:48,225
- Okay.
- Okay, follow me, kids.

1428
01:34:50,978 --> 01:34:52,396
Come on, let's go!

1429
01:35:05,367 --> 01:35:08,412
Now, that is an Avengers-level threat.

1430
01:35:25,053 --> 01:35:26,805
This way. This way!

1431
01:35:26,889 --> 01:35:28,348
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, my God!

1432
01:35:28,432 --> 01:35:30,142
- Flash!
- Follow that cursed hand.

1433
01:35:30,225 --> 01:35:31,852
This way, kids. Follow me.

1434
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:35,063
- It's not real, it's not real!
- It looks real to me!

1435
01:35:35,147 --> 01:35:36,440
Follow me, kids!

1436
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:38,692
Earth, wind, fire, water.

1437
01:35:38,775 --> 01:35:41,695
Oh, no. They joined forces
like the Power Rangers.

1438
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,488
- You're thinking of Voltron.
- Who?

1439
01:35:43,572 --> 01:35:45,449
Voltron! You're thinking of Voltron!

1440
01:35:45,532 --> 01:35:47,326
Hey, look, it's Mysterio!

1441
01:35:47,409 --> 01:35:48,619
He's gonna save us!

1442
01:35:52,122 --> 01:35:53,916
If Mysterio knows we know...

1443
01:35:53,999 --> 01:35:56,084
- Then we're in danger.
- Yeah, and so are they.

1444
01:35:56,168 --> 01:35:57,419
We should go.

1445
01:35:58,837 --> 01:35:59,796
Kill that witch!

1446
01:36:01,798 --> 01:36:04,343
This is for my family!

1447
01:36:06,011 --> 01:36:07,804
Get somewhere safe, Fury.

1448
01:36:07,888 --> 01:36:09,473
<i>I don't see this ending well.</i>

1449
01:36:09,556 --> 01:36:13,602
I appreciate your concern,
but I never leave my men behind.

1450
01:36:15,437 --> 01:36:17,397
All right, comms check.
Can you hear me, kid?

1451
01:36:17,481 --> 01:36:20,025
- I can. It's a little loud out here.
- I like the new suit.

1452
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:23,236
- Thanks.
- Whoa, Peter, you sure that's not real?

1453
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:25,822
Yeah, it's just 100 times bigger
than I expected.

1454
01:36:25,906 --> 01:36:27,366
Still the play?

1455
01:36:27,449 --> 01:36:29,826
We need to get high enough
so Beck doesn't see me coming.

1456
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:31,787
Copy. Stay sticky.

1457
01:36:34,915 --> 01:36:37,000
- Hey, Happy.
- Yeah, kid. What is it?

1458
01:36:37,084 --> 01:36:40,504
We need to have a serious conversation
about you and my aunt!

1459
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:56,603
Beck, report!

1460
01:36:56,687 --> 01:36:59,106
Guterman, I need a response.
Something quick and decisive.

1461
01:36:59,189 --> 01:37:02,567
"It's all the Elementals.
They're merged into something..."

1462
01:37:02,651 --> 01:37:04,653
...into something else.
Something more powerful.

1463
01:37:04,736 --> 01:37:06,738
It's drawing energy from the Earth's core.

1464
01:37:11,618 --> 01:37:13,495
See, now, that's some bullshit.

1465
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:17,624
Is that...?

1466
01:37:22,713 --> 01:37:24,089
Be ready for anything.

1467
01:37:24,172 --> 01:37:25,257
Yeah.

1468
01:37:31,555 --> 01:37:33,598
It's not real, it's not real, it's not real!

1469
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:41,481
That's awesome.

1470
01:38:07,340 --> 01:38:09,342
William, I've got drones
breaking formation.

1471
01:38:09,426 --> 01:38:11,762
Maybe they hit a flock of birds.
You're fine.

1472
01:38:11,845 --> 01:38:13,847
I wanna see what's happening
Taking manual control.

1473
01:38:20,645 --> 01:38:22,731
<i>Do you see anything?</i>

1474
01:38:22,814 --> 01:38:25,859
Yeah. And I'm gonna kill him.

1475
01:38:30,489 --> 01:38:32,365
I hope this works.

1476
01:38:48,548 --> 01:38:49,549
You got me?

1477
01:38:54,638 --> 01:38:55,555
I got you.

1478
01:38:56,098 --> 01:38:57,849
<i>Boss, the illusion is coming apart.</i>

1479
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:02,771
I see you.

1480
01:39:06,733 --> 01:39:08,777
- EDITH, give me protection.
- <i>Copy.</i>

1481
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:26,336
- Just kill the illusion. Kill it.
- I'm not gonna kill it. They'll see.

1482
01:39:26,419 --> 01:39:28,880
They'll see what I want them to see!

1483
01:39:28,964 --> 01:39:31,925
- Do you still need the cape?
- Yes, Janice.

1484
01:39:32,008 --> 01:39:34,094
- I still need the cape.
- Done.

1485
01:39:36,972 --> 01:39:39,266
- William, render my illusion suit.
- All right, hang on.

1486
01:39:39,349 --> 01:39:41,518
<i>The monster was full of drones!
It's crazy!</i>

1487
01:39:41,601 --> 01:39:42,853
There you are.

1488
01:39:46,565 --> 01:39:47,649
Easy.

1489
01:39:51,945 --> 01:39:53,280
Who the hell is that?

1490
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:56,116
- Ned!
- Happy!

1491
01:39:56,199 --> 01:39:58,493
I gotta get you guys out of here!
Get on the jet!

1492
01:39:58,577 --> 01:40:00,745
- Who are you?
- I work with Spider-Man, okay?

1493
01:40:00,829 --> 01:40:02,747
- Get on that jet.
- You work for Spider-Man?

1494
01:40:02,831 --> 01:40:05,125
I work with Spider-Man,
not for Spider-Man.

1495
01:40:08,336 --> 01:40:10,338
- New plan. Into the Tower.
- What?

1496
01:40:10,422 --> 01:40:13,383
- Happy, are you okay?
- <i>We're okay. Just get Beck.</i>

1497
01:40:13,466 --> 01:40:15,844
- EDITH, target Spider-Man.
- <i>Copy.</i>

1498
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,517
I'll just kill the kids myself.

1499
01:40:37,157 --> 01:40:38,533
There you are.

1500
01:40:40,952 --> 01:40:42,621
Into the Crown Jewels vault!

1501
01:40:42,704 --> 01:40:44,623
- Yeah, go, go, go!
- Come on.

1502
01:40:48,543 --> 01:40:50,962
- Go!
- Into the vault! The walls are 8 feet thick.

1503
01:40:51,046 --> 01:40:52,172
Go into the vault!

1504
01:40:52,255 --> 01:40:53,548
- What?
- Into the vault. Go!

1505
01:40:56,593 --> 01:40:57,594
Take cover!

1506
01:41:16,696 --> 01:41:17,697
Okay.

1507
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:23,245
Yeah?

1508
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:25,205
<i>No. No.</i>

1509
01:41:29,459 --> 01:41:30,752
I see you.

1510
01:41:32,963 --> 01:41:33,964
Get that thing out--

1511
01:41:39,511 --> 01:41:40,679
Go!

1512
01:41:47,477 --> 01:41:49,145
How does Cap do that?!

1513
01:41:58,947 --> 01:42:02,158
Happy, say something,
to let me know you're alive!

1514
01:42:02,242 --> 01:42:04,536
- <i>I'm here. I'm here.</i>
- Happy, thank God.

1515
01:42:04,619 --> 01:42:06,121
I bought us some time.

1516
01:42:07,747 --> 01:42:09,541
- But not much.
- <i>I'm trying to get to Beck,</i>

1517
01:42:09,624 --> 01:42:11,293
but I can't shake these drones!

1518
01:42:26,182 --> 01:42:27,100
Gotcha.

1519
01:42:49,414 --> 01:42:50,582
Going up!

1520
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:28,995
Finally.

1521
01:43:29,079 --> 01:43:33,083
- Hey, William, how we doing?
- Illusion almost back up.

1522
01:43:33,166 --> 01:43:34,876
<i>I don't know how you're gonna spin this.</i>

1523
01:43:50,058 --> 01:43:51,351
Oh, great. No webs.

1524
01:44:05,031 --> 01:44:07,283
- Are we gonna die?
- Nobody dies on my watch.

1525
01:44:09,953 --> 01:44:12,705
I wasted my life playing video games,
and we're gonna die.

1526
01:44:13,581 --> 01:44:16,584
I have a fake ID,
and I've never even used it.

1527
01:44:17,502 --> 01:44:20,171
I post stupid videos daily
for people to like me.

1528
01:44:20,255 --> 01:44:22,882
Hey, if it wasn't for those stupid videos,

1529
01:44:22,966 --> 01:44:25,093
Spider-Man would've never found you.

1530
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:28,847
Spider-Man--? Spider-Man follows me?
I saved us, guys.

1531
01:44:28,930 --> 01:44:30,640
If you saved us,
why are we about to die?

1532
01:44:30,723 --> 01:44:32,142
- MJ!
- Stop it!

1533
01:44:32,225 --> 01:44:33,601
I'm sorry, okay?

1534
01:44:33,685 --> 01:44:36,688
I'm obsessed with telling the truth
even if it hurts people's feelings.

1535
01:44:38,022 --> 01:44:40,108
I'm in love with Spider-Man's aunt.

1536
01:44:44,154 --> 01:44:45,613
We're sharing, right?

1537
01:45:24,694 --> 01:45:26,237
Your lies are over, Beck.

1538
01:45:27,447 --> 01:45:30,950
This certainly isn't ideal,
but I have contingencies.

1539
01:45:31,034 --> 01:45:32,452
EDITH?

1540
01:45:40,210 --> 01:45:42,712
Just give me the glasses.

1541
01:45:42,795 --> 01:45:43,922
You want these?

1542
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:46,925
Come and get them.

1543
01:45:57,185 --> 01:45:58,728
Come on, Peter-tingle.

1544
01:46:23,461 --> 01:46:26,089
- Why aren't these drones firing?
- <i>You're in the strike zone.</i>

1545
01:46:26,172 --> 01:46:30,969
- <i>The chance of getting hit is--</i>
- No, fire all the drones now!

1546
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:50,154
Beck!

1547
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:55,243
Beck.

1548
01:46:56,369 --> 01:46:57,829
You lied to me.

1549
01:46:58,538 --> 01:47:00,707
- I trusted you.
- I know.

1550
01:47:01,249 --> 01:47:03,167
That's the most...

1551
01:47:03,251 --> 01:47:05,003
disappointing part.

1552
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:08,590
You're a good person, Peter.

1553
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,635
Such a weakness.

1554
01:47:14,679 --> 01:47:15,930
Stark was right.

1555
01:47:16,931 --> 01:47:18,349
You do deserve them.

1556
01:47:30,069 --> 01:47:31,738
You can't trick me anymore.

1557
01:47:35,742 --> 01:47:37,368
EDITH, turn off the drones.

1558
01:47:38,494 --> 01:47:41,831
<i>Biometric scan complete.
Welcome back, Peter.</i>

1559
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:44,751
- <i>Execute all cancellation protocols?</i>
- Just do it.

1560
01:47:44,834 --> 01:47:46,711
- Execute them all.
- <i>Confirmed.</i>

1561
01:47:55,887 --> 01:47:56,971
Give me the spear.

1562
01:47:58,264 --> 01:47:59,474
That's a halberd.

1563
01:48:04,479 --> 01:48:05,480
Thank you.

1564
01:48:09,651 --> 01:48:13,029
- How could you do all of this?
- You'll see, Peter.

1565
01:48:14,656 --> 01:48:17,825
People, they need to believe.

1566
01:48:19,369 --> 01:48:20,745
And nowadays...

1567
01:48:23,122 --> 01:48:24,916
they'll believe anything.

1568
01:48:35,802 --> 01:48:36,803
Is he...?

1569
01:48:38,429 --> 01:48:39,555
Is this real?

1570
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:43,059
<i>All illusions are down, Peter.</i>

1571
01:48:58,658 --> 01:48:59,659
Yeah!

1572
01:48:59,742 --> 01:49:01,327
Hey, where you going?

1573
01:49:09,043 --> 01:49:10,336
- MJ.
- Hey.

1574
01:49:11,337 --> 01:49:12,380
- Hey.
- Hey.

1575
01:49:12,463 --> 01:49:14,090
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. Are you okay?

1576
01:49:14,173 --> 01:49:16,592
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Is everybody else okay?

1577
01:49:16,676 --> 01:49:18,010
Yeah, everyone's okay.

1578
01:49:19,554 --> 01:49:22,140
- What happened?
- There was just the drones,

1579
01:49:22,223 --> 01:49:24,934
and they were following us,
and then they just stopped.

1580
01:49:26,728 --> 01:49:28,271
- Was that you?
- Yeah.

1581
01:49:29,689 --> 01:49:30,690
Did you get him?

1582
01:49:33,943 --> 01:49:35,611
- Yeah.
- Well, I...

1583
01:49:37,071 --> 01:49:38,156
brought that.

1584
01:49:39,073 --> 01:49:40,825
In case you needed some help.

1585
01:49:41,367 --> 01:49:42,201
Thanks.

1586
01:49:44,579 --> 01:49:49,041
Anyway, there was this sweaty guy
in the tower with us.

1587
01:49:49,125 --> 01:49:51,502
I think he works for you or something.

1588
01:49:51,586 --> 01:49:53,129
He...

1589
01:49:53,212 --> 01:49:55,465
- He gave me this.
- No.

1590
01:49:55,882 --> 01:49:56,716
No.

1591
01:49:58,176 --> 01:49:59,677
Oh, MJ, I'm so sorry.

1592
01:49:59,761 --> 01:50:01,888
- I had this stupid plan.
- Peter.

1593
01:50:01,971 --> 01:50:05,475
I wrote it down, I was gonna buy you this
and give it to you in Paris at the top--

1594
01:50:09,395 --> 01:50:10,730
And you kissed me.

1595
01:50:10,813 --> 01:50:13,399
- What? What?
- Yeah.

1596
01:50:13,483 --> 01:50:17,862
I don't really have much luck
when it comes to getting close to people.

1597
01:50:19,989 --> 01:50:21,157
So I lied.

1598
01:50:23,117 --> 01:50:27,205
I wasn't just watching you
because I thought you were Spider-Man.

1599
01:50:31,667 --> 01:50:33,169
That's great.

1600
01:50:34,462 --> 01:50:37,048
- Black dahlia, like the murder.
- The murder.

1601
01:50:37,131 --> 01:50:39,175
- Good.
- Yeah.

1602
01:50:39,258 --> 01:50:40,885
Sorry it's broken.

1603
01:50:40,968 --> 01:50:43,137
I actually like it better broken.

1604
01:50:45,014 --> 01:50:46,140
I really like you.

1605
01:50:47,809 --> 01:50:49,310
I really like you too.

1606
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:05,493
Okay. I should--

1607
01:51:05,576 --> 01:51:08,538
I should probably get back to the class.

1608
01:51:08,621 --> 01:51:09,497
I'll go and...

1609
01:51:11,123 --> 01:51:12,667
- Yeah. I don't know.
- Okay.

1610
01:51:14,836 --> 01:51:15,962
Just in case.

1611
01:51:23,970 --> 01:51:25,429
Yeah, no.

1612
01:51:25,513 --> 01:51:28,766
No, May, you're right.
He did great. He was strong.

1613
01:51:28,850 --> 01:51:30,935
Yeah. I'm glad he stayed too.

1614
01:51:31,018 --> 01:51:32,311
I gotta go.

1615
01:51:33,896 --> 01:51:36,816
I'm glad you're alive.
I guess the coded message worked.

1616
01:51:36,899 --> 01:51:39,527
"Appearances can be deceiving."

1617
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:41,863
I'm surprised you didn't
just wink in the camera.

1618
01:51:41,946 --> 01:51:42,989
It worked.

1619
01:51:43,072 --> 01:51:45,825
Only because I had serious doubts
about Beck from the beginning.

1620
01:51:45,908 --> 01:51:47,535
Not true. He had zero doubts.

1621
01:51:51,163 --> 01:51:52,164
Where's Parker?

1622
01:51:52,248 --> 01:51:53,583
He's with a girl.

1623
01:51:53,666 --> 01:51:56,252
I need to speak with him.

1624
01:51:56,961 --> 01:51:58,880
- He'll call you.
- He'll--?

1625
01:52:03,217 --> 01:52:05,261
Okay. Great.

1626
01:52:05,678 --> 01:52:07,138
Well, he better.

1627
01:52:07,221 --> 01:52:09,181
Or it's your ass.

1628
01:52:09,765 --> 01:52:12,727
And don't even think about ghosting me.

1629
01:52:29,994 --> 01:52:31,829
Are you sure
no one else has figured it out?

1630
01:52:31,913 --> 01:52:35,791
Yeah, it's not like anybody
really pays attention to you.

1631
01:52:35,875 --> 01:52:36,709
Ouch.

1632
01:52:37,251 --> 01:52:38,544
Except for me.

1633
01:52:39,045 --> 01:52:39,962
Thanks.

1634
01:52:40,046 --> 01:52:41,756
- Don't be late.
- I won't.

1635
01:52:41,839 --> 01:52:42,798
See you later.

1636
01:52:42,882 --> 01:52:45,509
- You guys are so cute.
- Thanks.

1637
01:52:47,011 --> 01:52:50,848
I was thinking we should all go
on a double date or something.

1638
01:52:50,932 --> 01:52:53,517
- Oh, we broke up.
- Oh, we broke up.

1639
01:52:53,601 --> 01:52:54,936
No. What? Why?

1640
01:52:55,019 --> 01:52:57,396
Men and women grow apart,

1641
01:52:57,480 --> 01:53:00,441
but the journey they share together
will always be a part of them.

1642
01:53:02,234 --> 01:53:04,236
- You are so wise.
- Thank you.

1643
01:53:07,573 --> 01:53:08,574
Hello, Gerald.

1644
01:53:09,909 --> 01:53:11,410
Could Mother not make it?

1645
01:53:17,917 --> 01:53:19,168
- May!
- I promise you--

1646
01:53:19,251 --> 01:53:21,504
Oh, he's here. Don't give me a ticket.

1647
01:53:24,006 --> 01:53:25,925
I'm so glad you're okay.

1648
01:53:26,008 --> 01:53:28,970
No, for real, I'm good.
I'm actually really fine.

1649
01:53:29,053 --> 01:53:30,930
Let's go. Where are your bags?

1650
01:53:31,013 --> 01:53:33,140
- Oh, right. They got blown up.
- Yeah.

1651
01:53:34,225 --> 01:53:36,560
- I got you some hot buttered bagels.
- Thank you so much.

1652
01:53:36,644 --> 01:53:37,561
I know my boy.

1653
01:53:37,645 --> 01:53:41,023
<i>I kept my identity pretty guarded
this past couple years.</i>

1654
01:53:41,107 --> 01:53:42,817
<i>I faced a lot of deception.</i>

1655
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:45,778
<i>And I'm tired of the lies.</i>

1656
01:53:45,861 --> 01:53:48,030
So it's time for the truth to be out there.

1657
01:53:51,158 --> 01:53:52,201
Are you dating?

1658
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:54,453
- Yes.
- Not really.

1659
01:53:55,454 --> 01:53:57,248
- What?
- Well--

1660
01:53:57,331 --> 01:53:59,291
- I think--
- Summer fling.

1661
01:53:59,375 --> 01:54:01,377
Yes, that evolves
and grows like any other.

1662
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:04,630
- I still don't know where it's going to go.
- Open to wherever it might lead.

1663
01:54:04,714 --> 01:54:06,757
- Anywhere. On or off.
- To share it with people...

1664
01:54:06,841 --> 01:54:10,761
- We'll always be friends, no matter what.
- I'm gonna go because I've got a date.

1665
01:54:10,845 --> 01:54:13,347
...because we all are interconnected.

1666
01:54:13,431 --> 01:54:14,557
- Bye.
- We are.

1667
01:54:33,284 --> 01:54:34,410
Sorry!

1668
01:55:11,238 --> 01:55:12,782
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

1669
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,201
- It's fine.
- You ready?

1670
01:55:15,284 --> 01:55:16,952
- Yeah.
- You're gonna love this.

1671
01:55:17,036 --> 01:55:18,913
Okay! Okay!

1672
01:55:18,996 --> 01:55:20,831
- Okay. Okay.
- You ready?

1673
01:55:20,915 --> 01:55:24,126
Yeah. I'm just not gonna watch.
I'm not gonna watch.

1674
01:55:26,128 --> 01:55:28,798
I should stop looking.
I'm gonna stop looking!

1675
01:57:45,434 --> 01:57:47,937
Okay. You can put me down now!
You can put me down now!

1676
01:57:50,064 --> 01:57:50,981
You okay?

1677
01:57:55,027 --> 01:57:57,029
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

1678
01:57:57,112 --> 01:57:59,657
Let's just-- Never, never doing that again.

1679
01:57:59,740 --> 01:58:01,450
- I'm never doing that again.
- Okay.

1680
01:58:02,034 --> 01:58:03,244
I should probably get out of here.

1681
01:58:03,327 --> 01:58:04,995
- Be safe.
- See you later.

1682
01:58:08,290 --> 01:58:10,334
<i>This is breaking news.</i>

1683
01:58:10,417 --> 01:58:13,337
<i>We come to you with revelations
about last week's attack in London.</i>

1684
01:58:13,420 --> 01:58:15,589

01:58:15,673 --> 01:58:20,594
<i>It shows Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio,
moments before his death.</i>

1686
01:58:20,678 --> 01:58:22,721
<i>A warning, you may find
this video disturbing.</i>

1687
01:58:22,805 --> 01:58:24,848
<i>I managed to send the Elemental
through the rift,</i>

1688
01:58:24,932 --> 01:58:26,767
<i>but I don't think l'm gonna make it.</i>

1689
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:28,477
<i>Spider-Man attacked me
for some reason.</i>

1690
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:30,854
<i>He has an army of weaponized drones,
Stark technology.</i>

1691
01:58:30,938 --> 01:58:34,275
<i>He's saying he's the only one who's
gonna be the new Iron Man, no one else.</i>

1692
01:58:35,067 --> 01:58:37,319
<i>Are you sure you want
to commence the drone attack?</i>

1693
01:58:37,403 --> 01:58:41,407
<i>-There will be significant casualties.
- Do it. Execute them all.</i>

1694
01:58:45,452 --> 01:58:48,664
<i>This shocking video was released
earlier today</i>

1695
01:58:48,747 --> 01:58:51,792
<i>on the controversial news website
The Daily Bugle.net.</i>

1696
01:58:51,875 --> 01:58:55,087
<i>There you have it, folks,
conclusive proof that Spider-Man</i>

1697
01:58:55,170 --> 01:58:58,173
<i>was responsible
for the murder of Mysterio,</i>

1698
01:58:58,257 --> 01:59:01,593
<i>an inter dimensional warrior
who gave his life to protect our planet</i>

1699
01:59:01,677 --> 01:59:04,054
<i>and who will no doubt go down in history</i>

1700
01:59:04,138 --> 01:59:07,141
<i>as the greatest superhero of all time.</i>

1701
01:59:07,975 --> 01:59:09,518
<i>But that's not all, folks.</i>

1702
01:59:09,601 --> 01:59:12,646
<i>Here's the real blockbuster.
Brace yourselves.</i>

1703
01:59:12,730 --> 01:59:15,774
<i>Spider-Man's real--
Spider-Man's real name is--</i>

1704
01:59:18,193 --> 01:59:21,196
<i>Spider-Man's name is Peter Parker.</i>

1705
01:59:21,905 --> 01:59:23,240
What the fu--?

1706
02:07:31,478 --> 02:07:32,771
You gotta tell him.

1707
02:07:34,856 --> 02:07:36,942
It was fine.

1708
02:07:37,025 --> 02:07:39,027
The little boy handled it.

1709
02:07:39,110 --> 02:07:40,737
We helped.

1710
02:07:40,821 --> 02:07:42,030
- Talos.
- Come <i>off</i> it.

1711
02:07:42,113 --> 02:07:44,616
How was I supposed to know
that the whole thing was fake?

1712
02:07:44,699 --> 02:07:47,077
I mean, that was all very convincing.

1713
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:50,789
The performances, the illusion,
that costume, the craftsmanship in that.

1714
02:07:50,872 --> 02:07:54,084
This is just embarrassing
for a shape-shifter. Fine.

1715
02:07:56,419 --> 02:07:59,047
Hey there.
I hope your mission is going well.

1716
02:07:59,130 --> 02:08:02,926
We gave the glasses to Parker
about a week ago, like you said.

1717
02:08:03,009 --> 02:08:06,471
And it was very touching, you know?

1718
02:08:06,555 --> 02:08:08,348
Really, really quite touching.

1719
02:08:08,431 --> 02:08:09,683
Talos.

1720
02:08:09,766 --> 02:08:14,062
And, you know, shortly after that,

1721
02:08:14,145 --> 02:08:17,107
it really kind of went <i>off</i> the rails,
and so we need you to come back

1722
02:08:17,190 --> 02:08:19,359
because everyone kept asking
where the Avengers are,

1723
02:08:19,442 --> 02:08:20,944
I don't know what to say to that,

1724
02:08:21,027 --> 02:08:22,654
<i>so you're lucky that Spider-Man won--</i>

1725
02:08:45,427 --> 02:08:46,970
Everybody back to work!

1726
02:08:54,436 --> 02:08:56,354
Who's got my shoes?
