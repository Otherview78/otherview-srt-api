1
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,941
- Three of a kind, let's do this.
- That's it? Three guys?

2
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,445
Two guys on the roof.
Every guy gets a share. Five shares is plenty.

3
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,072
Six shares.
Don't forget the guy who planned the job.

4
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,533
He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice.

5
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,828
- I know why they call him the Joker.
- Why do they call him the Joker?

6
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,830
- I heard he wears makeup.
- Makeup?

7
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,957
Yeah, to scare people.
You know, war paint.

8
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,723
All right, everybody,
hands up, heads down!

9
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,893
I said, hands up, heads down!

10
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,021
Let's go, pal,
I'm making a withdrawal here.

11
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,731
- I said, hands up!
- No!

12
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,359
Here comes the silent alarm.

13
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,860
And there it goes.

14
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,236
Heads down!

15
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,739
All right, tootsie,
you're taking a dive with me.

16
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,575
- Down! I said, stay down there!
- Don't hurt me!

17
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,828
Funny, it didn't dial 911.
It was trying to reach a private number.

18
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,914
- Is it a problem?
- No, I'm done here.

19
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,676
Sit down! Down!

20
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,345
Down! I said, stay down there!

21
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,435
Obviously we don't want you
doing anything with your hands...

22
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,522
...other than holding on for dear life.

23
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,281
On the ground! Stay on the ground!

24
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:22,119
Nobody make a move!
Nobody! Stay down!

25
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,594
Yeah!

26
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,516
You have any idea
who you're stealing from?

27
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:48,395
- You and your friends are dead.
- He's out, right?

28
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,733
What--?

29
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,325
Where did you learn to count?

30
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,582
They wired this thing up with like
5000 volts. What kind of bank does that?

31
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,793
A Mob bank.
I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.

32
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,003
Where's the alarm guy?

33
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,672
Boss told me when the guy
was done, I should take him out.

34
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,174
One less share, right?

35
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,343
Funny, he told me something similar.

36
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,970
He what? No! No!

37
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,066
That's a lot of money.

38
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,945
If this Joker guy was so smart,
he'd have had us bring a bigger car.

39
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:44,284
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me
soon as we loaded the cash.

40
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,997
No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.

41
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,832
Bus driver?

42
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,544
What bus driver?

43
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,550
School's out. Time to go.

44
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,969
That guy's not getting up, is he?

45
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,388
That's a lot of money.

46
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,228
What happened to the rest of the guys?

47
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,362
You think you're smart, huh?

48
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,697
The guy that hired yo use...

49
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,826
...he'll just do the same to you.

50
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,079
Oh, criminals in this town
used to believe in things.

51
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,539
Honor---

52
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,415
...respect.

53
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,918
Look at you.
What do you believe in, huh?

54
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,378
What do you believe in?!

55
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:41,633
I believe whatever doesn't kill you
simply makes you...

56
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,761
...stranger.

57
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,639
<i>Mr. Mayor, you were elected
in a campaign to clean up the city.</i>

58
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,975
<i>-When are you gonna start?
MAN 2“. I already have.</i>

59
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,979
<i>Like this Batman. We're hearing he's
doing good, criminals are running scared.</i>

60
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:39,858
- No, man. I don't like it tonight.
- What are you, superstitious?

61
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,111
You got more chance of winning
the Powerball than running into him.

62
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,656
<i>That's not true. Our men in the
Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.</i>

63
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,784
Hey, Wuertz, mayor says
you're closing in on the Batman.

64
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,078
The investigation is ongoing.

65
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,664
<i>The process of cleaning up
the streets is a long one.</i>

66
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,833
<i>I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have...</i>

67
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,465
Ever intending to see your wife again,
lieutenant?

68
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:06,301
I thought you had to
go look after your mother, detective.

69
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,428
Checked her back into the hospital.

70
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,513
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:14,309
- So he hasn't shown up?
- He often doesn't.

72
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,854
- I like reminding everybody he's out there.
- Why wouldn't he come?

73
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,023
Hopefully...

74
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,067
...because he's busy.

75
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,711
That's why we bring dogs.

76
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,214
- My little princes.
- Please.

77
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,968
Please, they're crawling in my mouth.
Please, I beg you, get them off.

78
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,887
Look what your drugs
do to my customers.

79
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,681
Buyer beware.

80
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,059
I told you my compound
would take you places.

81
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,979
I never said they'd be places
you wanted to go.

82
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,690
My business, repeat customers.

83
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:05,485
You don't like what I have
to offer, you can buy from someone else.

84
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,405
Assuming Batman left anyone
to buy from.

85
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,745
My dogs are hungry.

86
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,751
Pity there's only one of you.

87
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,386
- What--?
- That's not him.

88
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,517
Loose the dogs!

89
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,781
That's more like it.

90
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,621
Don't let me find you out here again.

91
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:24,624
- We're trying to help you.
- I don't need help.

92
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,126
Not my diagnosis.

93
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,879
What gives you the right?
What's the difference between you and me?

94
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,924
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

95
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,388
Everybody back now!

96
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,726
He can't resist showing us his face.

97
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,150
What's he hiding under that makeup?

98
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,535
Uh, can we get a minute, people, please?

99
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,331
Him again. Who are the others?

100
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,083
Another bunch of smalltimers.

101
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,170
Some of the marked bills I gave you.

102
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,630
My detectives have been
making drug buys with them.

103
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,383
This bank was another drop for the Mob.
That makes five.

104
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,136
- We found the bulk of their dirty cash.
- Time to move in.

105
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:22,098
We'd have to hit all banks simultaneously.
SWAT teams, backup.

106
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,100
What about this Joker guy?

107
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:27,228
One man or the entire Mob? He can wait.

108
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,731
When the new DA hears about this,
he'll want in.

109
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,442
- Do you trust him?
- Be hard to keep him out.

110
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:36,070
I hear he's as stubborn as you are.

111
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,575
Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt.

112
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,453
You can swap
not sleeping in a penthouse...

113
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,163
...for not sleeping in a mansion.

114
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,084
Whenever you stitch yourself up,
you do make a bloody mess.

115
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,254
Yeah. It makes me learn
from my mistakes.

116
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,840
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable
by now, then.

117
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,593
My armor.

118
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,347
I'm carrying too much weight.
I need to be-- I need to be faster.

119
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,183
I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.

120
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,852
- Did you get mauled by a tiger?
- It was a dog.

121
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,563
—Huh?
- It was a big dog.

122
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,609
There were more copycats last night,
Alfred, with guns.

123
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,695
Why not hire them,
take the weekend off?

124
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,698
That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind...

125
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:05,702
- ...when I said I wanted to inspire people.
- I know.

126
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,370
But things have improved.

127
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,039
Look at the new district attorney.

128
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,709
I am, closely.

129
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,794
Need to know if he can be trusted.

130
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:19,007
Are you interested in his character
or his social circle?

131
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:25,221
Who Rachel spends her time with
is her business.

132
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,267
I trust you don't have me followed
on my day off.

133
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,519
If you ever took one, I might.

134
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,231
Know your limits, Master Wayne.

135
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,526
Batman has no limits.

136
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,738
- Well, you do, sir.
- Well, can't afford to know them.

137
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,407
And what's gonna happen
on the day that you find out?

138
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,285
We all know how much you like to say
"I told you so."

139
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,788
On that day, Master Wayne,
even I won't want to.

140
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,415
Probably.

141
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,923
Sorry I'm late, folks.

142
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,055
- Where were you?
- Worried you'd have to step up?

143
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,224
- Harvey, I know these briefs backwards.
- Well, then...

144
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,393
...fair's fair.

145
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,604
Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.

146
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,856
Yeah? You wanna
flip a coin to see who leads?

147
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,443
My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.

148
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,780
I wouldn't leave something like that
up to chance.

149
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,200
I don't. I make my own luck.

150
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,747
All rise.
The Honorable Judge Freel presiding.

151
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:35,583
I thought the DA just
played golf with the mayor.

152
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,462
Teeoff's 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Sally.

153
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,172
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham...

154
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,342
...someone must have stepped up
to run the so-called family.

155
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,470
Is that man in this courtroom today?

156
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,642
- Could you identify him for us, please?
- You Win, counselor.

157
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,479
It was me.

158
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,984
I have a sworn statement from you
that this man...

159
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,863
...Salvatore Maroni, is the new head
of the Falcone crime family.

160
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,159
Maroni? He's a fall guy.
I'm the brains of the organization.

161
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,830
- Order.
- Permission to treat the witness as hostile?

162
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,706
- Granted.
- Hostile? I'll show you hostile!

163
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,674
Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China.

164
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:28,761
If you wanna kill a public servant,
Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy American.

165
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,306
- Get him out of here.
- But, Your Honor, I'm not done.

166
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,313
We'll never be able to link the gun
to Maroni, so we can't charge him.

167
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,275
But they're trying to kill you,
means we're getting to them.

168
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,570
I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel.
I'm fine, by the way.

169
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,447
Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's DA.

170
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,450
You're not getting shot at,
you're not doing your job right.

171
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,826
But, you know...

172
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:55,329
...if you said you were rattled,
we could take the rest of the day off.

173
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,416
Can't. I dragged the head of
the Major Crimes Unit down here.

174
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:03,337
Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually.
Try to be nice.

175
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,183
I hear you got a hell of a right cross.

176
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,605
It's a shame Sal's going to walk.

177
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:24,817
Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob
is they keep giving you second chances.

178
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,325
Lightly irradiated bills.

179
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,077
Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?

180
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,246
We liaise with various agencies--

181
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,165
Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.

182
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,919
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante
known as Batman on sight.

183
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,254
Mm-hm. What about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?

184
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,840
If you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment...

185
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,219
...I suggest you take them up
with Maintenance, counselor.

186
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,055
I've put every money launderer
in Gotham behind bars...

187
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,599
...but the Mob
is still getting its money out.

188
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,228
I think you and your friend
have found the last game in town.

189
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,105
You're trying to hit them
where it hurts, their wallets.

190
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,440
It's bold.

191
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,526
You gonna count me in?

192
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,446
In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.

193
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,865
I don't like that you got
your own special unit...

194
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,952
...and it's full of cops
I investigated at Internal Affairs.

195
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,955
If I didn't work with cops
you'd investigated while at IA...

196
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,373
...I'd be working alone.

197
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:25,628
I don't get political points for being an
idealist. I do the best I can with what I have.

198
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,969
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks...

199
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,971
...without telling me what we're after.

200
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,641
I can give you the names of the banks.

201
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,726
Well, that's a start.

202
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,437
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

203
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,441
Oh, you don't have to sell me, Dent.
We all know you're Gotham's white knight.

204
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:52,154
Yeah, well, I heard they have
a different name for me down at MCU.

205
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,073
I wouldn't know about that.

206
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,995
In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

207
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:03,457
A joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

208
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,543
Well, Mr. Lau...

209
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,671
...I speak for the rest of the board...

210
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:12,174
...and Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

211
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,683
Sir, I know Mr. Wayne is curious about
how his trust fund gets replenished...

212
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,352
...but, frankly, this is embarrassing.

213
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,105
You worry about the diligence,
Mr. Reese.

214
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,566
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

215
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,276
It's done.

216
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,194
The numbers are solid.

217
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,904
Do them again.

218
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,158
Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out,
now, would we?

219
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,495
Another long night?

220
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,624
This joint venture was your idea,
and the consultants love it.

221
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,542
But I'm not convinced.

222
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:50,379
Lau's company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork.

223
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,965
His revenue stream
must be off the books...

224
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,550
...maybe even illegal.

225
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,385
Okay. Cancel the deal.

226
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,888
You already knew.

227
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,141
Just needed a closer look at their books.

228
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,352
Anything else you can trouble me for?

229
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,354
I need a new suit.

230
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,023
Yeah. Three buttons
is a little '903, Mr. Wayne.

231
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,318
I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox,
so much as function.

232
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,071
You wanna be able to turn your head.

233
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,323
Sure make backing out
of the driveway easier.

234
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,325
I'll see what I can do.

235
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,040
Took three weeks
to get a reservation here.

236
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:28,334
I had to tell them
I work for the government.

237
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,170
- Really?
- Health inspector's not afraid to pull strings.

238
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,547
Rachel. Fancy that.

239
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,217
Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.

240
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,719
Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.

241
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:44,266
- Natascha. Are you the prima--?
- Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.

242
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,770
- Wow. Harvey's taking me next week.
- Really? So you're into ballet?

243
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,272
Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.

244
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:54,360
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.

245
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,736
I certainly hope not.

246
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,407
- Let's put a couple tables together.
- I'm not sure that they'll let us.

247
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,618
Oh, they should. I own the place.

248
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,038
How could you want to raise children
in a city like this?

249
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,917
- Well, I was raised here. I turned out okay.
- Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?

250
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,585
Is--? Heh-heh.

251
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,295
The Palisades? Sure.

252
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:17,925
You know, as our new DA, you might wanna
figure out where your jurisdiction ends.

253
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:22,054
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

254
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,599
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary citizen
standing up for what's right.

255
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,018
Gotham needs heroes like you,
elected officials...

256
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,480
- ...not a man who thinks he's above the law.
- Who appointed the Batman?

257
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:35,484
We did. All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

258
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,403
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

259
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,321
When their enemies were at the gates...

260
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:43,200
...the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

261
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,953
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was a public service.

262
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,249
Harvey, the last man that they appointed to
protect the republic was named Caesar...

263
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,836
- ...and he never gave up his power.
- Okay, fine.

264
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,337
You either die a hero...

265
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,549
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

266
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:02,219
Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
wanna do this for the rest of his life.

267
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,639
How could he? Batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle.

268
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,100
Someone like you, Mr. Dent?

269
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,020
Maybe. If I'm up to it.

270
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:16,442
What if Harvey Dent
is the Caped Crusader? Hm?

271
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,864
If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would've noticed by now.

272
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:28,370
Well, I'm sold, Dent,
and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.

273
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,373
That's nice, but I'm not
up for reelection for three years.

274
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,459
No, you don't understand.

275
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,420
One fundraiser with my pals...

276
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,215
...you'll never need another cent.

277
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,023
What the hell is this?

278
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:00,486
<i>As you're all aware,
one of our deposits was stolen.</i>

279
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:04,031
<i>A relatively small amount, 68 million.</i>

280
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:06,742
Who's stupid enough to steal from us?

281
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:10,621
Two-bit wackjob,
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.

282
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,748
He's not the problem. He's a nobody.

283
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:16,293
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

284
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,963
<i>Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well-placed sources...</i>

285
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,925
<i>...we know that police have indeed
identified our banks using marked bills...</i>

286
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,594
<i>...and are planning to
seize your funds today.</i>

287
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,765
<i>And since the enthusiastic new DA has
put all my competitors out of business...</i>

288
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,894
<i>- ...I'm your only option.</i>
<i>- So, What are you proposing?</i>

289
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,731
<i>Moving all deposits to
one secure location, not a bank.</i>

290
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,859
- Where, then?
- No one can <i>know</i> but me.

291
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,362
<i>If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you...</i>

292
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,322
<i>...everyone's money would be at stake.</i>

293
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,616
What stop them getting to you?

294
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,870
<i>I go to Hong Kong,
far from Dent's jurisdiction...</i>

295
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:54,123
<i>...and the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.</i>

296
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,916
<i>How soon can you move the money?</i>

297
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,293
<i>I already have.</i>

298
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,298
For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait
for your permission.

299
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,594
<i>Rest assured, your money is safe.</i>

300
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:18,772
Oh, hee-hee, aha.
Ha, ooh, hee, ha-ha, ha-ha.

301
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,191
And I thought my jokes were bad.

302
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,445
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy pull your head off.

303
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:25,905
How about a magic trick?

304
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,577
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.

305
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:34,997
Ta-da!

306
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,665
It's--

307
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,126
It's gone.

308
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,837
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

309
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,840
- You ought to know, you bought it.
- Sit.

310
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,969
I want to hear proposition.

311
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,183
Let's wind the clocks back a year.

312
00:23:54,516 --> 00:24:00,189
These cops and lawyers
wouldn't dare cross any of you.

313
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,484
I mean, what happened?

314
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:07,446
Did your balls drop off? Hm?

315
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,657
You see, a guy like me...

316
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,868
- A freak.
- Damn right.

317
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:16,163
A guy like me-- Look, listen.

318
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:21,001
I know why you choose
to have your little, ahem...

319
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,879
...group-therapy sessions
in broad daylight.

320
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,174
I know why you're afraid
to go out at night.

321
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,053
The Batman.

322
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:36,475
See, Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.

323
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:40,145
Dent, he's just the beginning.

324
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:45,484
And as for the television's
so-called plan...

325
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,820
...Batman has no jurisdiction.

326
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,572
He'll find him and make him squeal.

327
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,742
I know the squealers when I see them...

328
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,577
...and...

329
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,830
What do you propose?

330
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,416
It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.

331
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,712
If it's so simple, why haven't
you done it already?

332
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,589
If you're good at something,
never do it for free.

333
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,550
How much you want?

334
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,261
Uh, half.

335
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,224
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm not.

336
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,518
No, I'm not.

337
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:24,523
If we don't deal with this now...

338
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,316
<i>"500“...</i>

339
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:31,447
...little Gambol here won't be able
to get a nickel for his grandma.

340
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,574
Enough from the clown!

341
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:36,702
Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow...

342
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,413
- Shit!
- ...this out of proportion.

343
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,082
You think you can steal from us
and just walk away?

344
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,792
- Yeah.
- I'm putting the word out.

345
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,253
Five hundred grand for this clown dead.

346
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,465
A million alive, so I can teach him
some manners first.

347
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,343
All right. So, listen,
why don't you give me a call...

348
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,264
...when you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously?

349
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,308
Here's my card.

350
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,397
Mm-mm.

351
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,789
You're a hard man to reach.

352
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,086
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.

353
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:31,215
If you'd have asked,
I could have taken his passport.

354
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,051
All that was left in the vaults
were marked bills.

355
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:37,513
They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got involved--

356
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,680
My office?

357
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:42,559
You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking--

358
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,854
Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beat.

359
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:50,567
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.

360
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,322
We need Lau back...

361
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:59,451
...but the Chinese won't extradite
a national under any circumstances.

362
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,496
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

363
00:27:02,663 --> 00:27:03,872
I'll get him to sing.

364
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,792
We're going after the Mob's life savings.

365
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,210
Things will get ugly.

366
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,671
I knew the risk when I took this job,
lieutenant.

367
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:12,381
How will you get him back, any--?

368
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,385
He does that.

369
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:20,055
Our Chinese friends left town
before I could tell them the deal was off.

370
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:23,725
Well, I'm sure that you've always wanted
to go to Hong Kong.

371
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,061
What's wrong with a phone call?

372
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:29,857
I think Mr. Lau deserves
a more personal touch.

373
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:35,863
Now, for high-altitude jumps,
you're going to need oxygen and stabilizers.

374
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:39,658
Well, I must say,
compared to your usual requests...

375
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,411
...jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightforward.

376
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,164
What about getting back into the plane?

377
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,168
- I'd recommend a good travel agent.
- Without it landing.

378
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,088
Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

379
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,258
The CIA had a program back in the '60s...

380
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:59,761
...for getting their people out of hot spots
called Sky Hook.

381
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,598
- We could look into that.
- Yeah.

382
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,433
Okay. Now...

383
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:10,939
Hardened Kevlar plates over titanium-dipped
tri-weave fibers for flexibility.

384
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,942
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

385
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,615
Perhaps you should
read the instructions first?

386
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,783
- Yeah.
- Now, there is a tradeoff.

387
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,454
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

388
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,582
We wouldn't wanna make things
too easy, now, would we?

389
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,792
How will it hold up against dogs?

390
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,086
We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas?

391
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,798
Should do fine against cats.

392
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,092
I found one in Arizona.

393
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:43,430
A very nice man said he could have it up
and running in a week, and he takes cash.

394
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:46,433
- What about the flight crew?
- South Korean smugglers.

395
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,810
They run flights into Pyongyang,
below radar.

396
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,730
- Did you think of an alibi?
- Oh, yes.

397
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:13,126
I believe this is your plane, sir.

398
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:20,842
You look tired, Alfred.
You'll be all right without me?

399
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:26,014
If you can tell me the Russian for
"apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

400
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,988
Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

401
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,990
They brought the body.

402
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,883
80, dead, that's 500.

403
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,637
How about alive? Hm?

404
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:12,019
You wanna know how I got these scars?

405
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,940
My father was...

406
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:18,567
...a drinker...

407
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:19,985
...and a fiend.

408
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,990
And one night,
he goes off crazier than usual.

409
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,201
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.

410
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,911
He doesn't like that...

411
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,540
...not one bit.

412
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:36,251
80, me watching...

413
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:41,006
...he takes the knife to her,
laughing while he does it.

414
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:44,259
He turns to me and he says:

415
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:48,096
"Why so serious?"

416
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,931
He comes at me with the knife.

417
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,517
"Why so serious?"

418
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,647
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

419
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:01,902
"Let's put a smile on that face."

420
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,322
And...

421
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,242
Why so serious?

422
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,791
Now...

423
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,210
...our operation is small...

424
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,296
...but there is a lot of potential...

425
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:24,007
...for aggressive expansion.

426
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:27,386
So which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team?

427
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:31,973
Oh. There's only one spot open right now,
so we're gonna have...

428
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:34,810
...tryouts.

429
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,400
Make it fast.

430
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,244
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

431
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,122
Mr. Lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today.

432
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,207
I understand.

433
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,595
For security purposes, I'm gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobile.

434
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,347
Of course.

435
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,812
I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.

436
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:22,524
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force...

437
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,235
- ...I couldn't let it threaten my company.
- Of course.

438
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:28,572
A businessman of your stature
will understand and...

439
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:32,701
...with you here now, we can continue.

440
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:36,621
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re--

441
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,000
We do not allow cell phones in here.

442
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,878
I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.

443
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:47,674
No, I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.

444
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,303
You see, we can't afford
to be seen to do business with...

445
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,389
...whatever it is you're accused of being.

446
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,142
I'm sure a businessman of your stature
will understand.

447
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:01,229
I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call
might have sufficed.

448
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,774
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think
he was deliberately wasting your time.

449
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,568
Just accidentally wasting it.

450
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:11,740
That's very good, Mr. Lau.
"Accidentally." Very good.

451
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,867
Hey, sir.

452
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,095
There's a better view from the peak tram.

453
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,097
How's the view from LSI Holdings?

454
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,933
Restricted.

455
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,101
Lau is holed up in there good and tight.

456
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,187
- What's this?
- I had R & D work it up.

457
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,022
Sends out a high-frequency pulse...

458
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:47,025
...records the response time
for mapping an environment.

459
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,111
Sonar. Just like a...

460
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,447
Submarine, Mr. Wayne. Like a submarine.

461
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,783
- And the other device?
- It's in place.

462
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,743
Mr. Wayne?

463
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:59,246
Good luck.

464
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,395
Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.

465
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,857
The money is the only reason
I'm still alive.

466
00:37:56,024 --> 00:38:00,153
Oh, you mean, when they find out that
you've helped us, they're gonna kill you?

467
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,030
- Are you threatening my client?
- No.

468
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:06,409
I'm just assuming your client's
cooperation with this investigation.

469
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:09,704
As will everyone.

470
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,375
No? Okay.

471
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,837
Enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau.

472
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,506
Wait!

473
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,716
I won't give you the money...

474
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,886
...but I will give you my clients,
all of them.

475
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,388
You were a glorified accountant.

476
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:31,392
What could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge?

477
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:35,396
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all their investments.

478
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,148
One big pot.

479
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:39,859
Got it.

480
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,111
One minute.

481
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:47,575
RICO. If they pooled their money, we can
charge them as one criminal conspiracy.

482
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,910
Charge them with what?

483
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:51,955
In a RICO case, if you can charge
one of them with a felony--

484
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,707
You can charge all of them with it.
That's great.

485
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,002
Mr. Lau.

486
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:03,007
What kind of details do you have
about this communal fund?

487
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,801
- Ledgers--?
- Immunity, protection...

488
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:08,429
- ...a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
- After you testify in open court.

489
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,932
I'm just curious.
With all your clients locked up...

490
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,476
...what's gonna happen
with all that money?

491
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:16,771
Like I said, I'm good with calculation.

492
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:21,609
He can't go to County.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

493
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,320
What is this, Gordon, your fortress?

494
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,282
Well, you trust them over at County?

495
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,284
I don't trust them here.

496
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,537
Lau stays.

497
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:37,542
<i>Well, I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel
arrangements, but I'm sure glad he's back.</i>

498
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,169
Put word out. We hire the clown.

499
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:46,801
He was right.
We have to fix real problem.

500
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,428
Batman.

501
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:56,895
<i>-I'm not aware of any participation...</i>
- Our <i>boy</i> looks good <i>on the tube.</i>

502
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,148
You sure you wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends?

503
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:03,985
Oh, don't worry. They're coming too.

504
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,660
Have a nice trip. See you next fall.

505
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,662
<i>Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion.</i>

506
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,248
<i>Eight hundred and forty-nine
counts of racketeering.</i>

507
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:22,962
Two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud.
Eighty-seven counts of conspiracy murder.

508
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,008
Five hundred and twenty-seven
counts of obstruction of justice.

509
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,801
How do the defendants plead?

510
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,018
Order in the court.

511
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,687
<i>Five hundred and forty-nine
criminals at once.</i>

512
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,357
How did you convince Surrillo
to hear this farce?

513
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:46,653
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.

514
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,864
Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convictions out of Surrillo...

515
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,617
...you're gonna set
a new record at appeals.

516
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,286
It won't matter.
The head guys make bail, sure.

517
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,872
But the mid level guys, they can't.

518
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:02,168
They can't afford to be off the streets.
They'll cut deals that include some jail time.

519
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:05,338
Think of all you could do
with 18 months of clean streets.

520
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:10,009
- Mr. Mayor, you can't--
- No, get out. Both of you.

521
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,723
Sit down.

522
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,690
The public likes you.
That's the only reason that this might fly.

523
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,191
But that means it's on you.

524
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,403
They're all gonna come after you now,
and not just the Mob.

525
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:32,407
Politicians, journalists, cops.

526
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,076
Anyone whose wallet's
about to get lighter.

527
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,912
Are you up to it? You'd better be.

528
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,206
Because they get anything on you...

529
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:45,169
...and those criminals are back on the
streets, followed swiftly by you and me.

530
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,629
Jesus!

531
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,236
I think your fundraiser
will be a great success, sir.

532
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:13,072
And why do you think I wanna
hold a party for Harvey Dent?

533
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,325
I assumed it was your usual reason
for socializing beyond myself...

534
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,536
...and the scum of Gotham's underbelly:

535
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,496
To try to impress Miss Dawes.

536
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:24,751
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually, it's Dent.

537
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,795
<i>Police released
video footage found concealed on the body.</i>

538
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,590
<i>Sensitive viewers, be aware.
The image is disturbing.</i>

539
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:32,967
<i>Tell them your name.</i>

540
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,802
<i>Brian Douglas.</i>

541
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,723
<i>And are you the real Batman?</i>

542
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:39,932
- No.
- No?

543
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,060
<i>-No.
- No?</i>

544
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,936
<i>Then why do you dress up like him?</i>

545
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,481
<i>Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

546
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:50,777
<i>Because he's a symbol that we
don't have to be afraid of scum like you.</i>

547
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:54,280
<i>Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do.</i>

548
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:58,076
<i>Huh? Yeah. Oh, shh, shh, Shh.</i>

549
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:02,705
<i>So you think Batman's
made Gotham a better place? Hm?</i>

550
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,457
<i>Look at me.</i>

551
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:06,918
<i>Look at me!</i>

552
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,175
<i>You see, this is how crazy
Batman's made Gotham.</i>

553
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,636
<i>You want order in Gotham...</i>

554
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:21,390
<i>...Batman must take off his mask
and turn himself in.</i>

555
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:25,353
<i>Oh, and every day he doesn't,
people will die.</i>

556
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,814
<i>Starting tonight.</i>

557
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:30,441
<i>I'm a man of my word.</i>

558
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,545
Harvey Dent,
scourge of the underworld...

559
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,798
...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.

560
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,216
- I'll be back.
- Rachel.

561
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:58,219
A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?

562
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,805
- Thank you. Alfred, right?
- That's right, sir.

563
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:04,267
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life.

564
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,685
Not yet, sir.

565
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,231
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
I should be aware of?

566
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,650
Oh, you have no idea.

567
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:35,548
I'm sorry that I'm late. I'm glad
to see that you all got started without me.

568
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:39,427
Now, where is Harvey? Where——?

569
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,013
Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.

570
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,514
Where's Rachel Dawes?

571
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,058
She is my oldest friend. Come here.

572
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:50,104
When Rachel first told me she was dating
Harvey Dent, I had one thing to say:

573
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,732
"The guy from those God-awful
campaign commercials?"

574
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:56,736
"I believe in Harvey Dent."
Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.

575
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:58,905
But it caught Rachel's attention.

576
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:02,074
And then I started to pay attention
to Harvey...

577
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,786
...and all that he's been doing
as our new DA.

578
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,747
And you know what?

579
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,292
I believe in Harvey Dent.

580
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:15,046
I believe that on his watch,
Gotham can feel...

581
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:18,883
...a little safer, a little more optimistic.

582
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:24,639
Look at this face. This is the face
of Gotham's bright future.

583
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,974
To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.

584
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:28,893
Harvey.

585
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,989
Harvey may not know you well enough
to understand you're making fun of him...

586
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,158
—...but I do.
- No, I meant every word.

587
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:48,412
You know that day
that you once told me about...

588
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,665
...when Gotham would no longer
need Batman?

589
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,750
- It's coming.
- Bruce.

590
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:59,173
- You can't ask me to wait for that.
- It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.

591
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,803
He looked up half of the city's criminals,
and he did it without wearing a mask.

592
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,180
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

593
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,308
You can throw a party, Wayne,
I'll give you that.

594
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:12,603
Thanks again.

595
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,106
You mind if I borrow Rachel?

596
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:22,863
Lieutenant, that joker card pinned to the
body? Forensics found three sets of DNA.

597
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,448
- Any matches?
- All three.

598
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:28,119
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.

599
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,288
The Joker's telling us who he's targeting.

600
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,332
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

601
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,543
Protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?

602
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,211
- City hall.
- Seal the building.

603
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,380
- No one in or out till I get there.
- Got it.

604
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:54,061
Gordon. What are you up to?

605
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,481
We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor search
of the entire building.

606
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,234
We believe the Joker's
made a threat against your life.

607
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:01,819
These are dangerous people.

608
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,865
- You're not giving me a lot of information.
- Even we don't know where you're going.

609
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:09,368
Take the envelope, get in, open it.
It'll tell you where you're headed.

610
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,124
You can't leave me alone
with these people.

611
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:18,336
The whole Mob's after you
and you're worried about these guys?

612
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,463
Compared to this,
the Mob doesn't scare me.

613
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:24,216
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this
for yourself, so...

614
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:28,471
...take my word, the police commissioner
earns a lot of threats.

615
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:34,185
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.

616
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,645
Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.

617
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,147
Yeah, I bet.

618
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:42,610
Yeah. It makes you think about things
you couldn't stand losing...

619
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,779
...about who you wanna
spend your life with.

620
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,948
- That's a pretty big commitment.
- Not if the Mob has their way.

621
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:55,873
You get to explain to my wife...

622
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,376
...why I'm late for dinner.

623
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,712
Sir, the joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.

624
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,925
- Don't do that.
- All right.

625
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:09,387
- Let's be serious, then.
- Okay.

626
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,763
What's your answer?

627
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,437
I don't have an answer.

628
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,649
How'd they get my DNA?

629
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,984
Somebody with access
to your office or house...

630
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,779
...must have lifted a tissue
or a glass-- Wait! Wait!

631
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:29,865
- Well, I guess no answer is a no.
- Harvey.

632
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,159
- It's someone else, isn't it?
- Harvey.

633
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:35,496
Just tell me it's not Wayne.
The guy's a complete f--

634
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,456
What are you doing?

635
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:49,677
Oh, shit.

636
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,601
Get a medic!

637
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,148
They've come for him.

638
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,817
We made it.

639
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:08,446
Stay hidden.

640
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:14,034
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

641
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:20,875
We are tonight's entertainment.

642
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:24,044
I only have one question:

643
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:27,798
Where is Harvey Dent?

644
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:39,351
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

645
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,811
Hands up, pretty boy.

646
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:50,738
Do you know where I can find Harvey?
I need to talk to him.

647
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:53,741
Just something little, huh? No.

648
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:58,787
What's going on out there? Wayne!

649
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,958
- Oh, thank God, you've got a panic room.
- Hey, wait--

650
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,336
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

651
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:07,630
You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.

652
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:11,300
We're not intimidated by thugs.

653
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,969
You know...

654
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:18,599
...you remind me of my father.

655
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:20,893
I hated my father.

656
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,103
Okay, stop.

657
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,777
Well, hello, beautiful.

658
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:35,783
You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?

659
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:38,661
And you are beautiful.

660
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:49,463
You look nervous. Is it the scars?

661
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,591
You wanna know how I got them?

662
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,345
Come here. Hey.

663
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,430
Look at me.

664
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:03,644
So I had a wife.
She was beautiful, like you...

665
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:08,107
...who tells me I worry too much...

666
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:11,193
...who tells me I ought to smile more...

667
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:16,865
...who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks. Hey.

668
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:19,702
One day they carve her face.

669
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:24,456
And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.

670
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:28,335
I just wanna see her smile again. Hm?

671
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:31,589
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

672
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:33,674
So...

673
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:37,928
...I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this...

674
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:39,763
...to myself.

675
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:45,144
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me.

676
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,854
She leaves.

677
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:49,982
Now I see the funny side.

678
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,443
Now I'm always smiling.

679
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:59,199
You got a little fight in you. I like that.

680
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,701
Then you're gonna love me.

681
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,064
Drop the gun.

682
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:35,235
Oh, sure. You just take off your little mask
and show us all who you really are. Hm?

683
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,076
Let her go.

684
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,286
Very poor choice of words.

685
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:08,977
Are you all right?

686
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:13,607
Let's not do that again.

687
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,402
- Is Harvey okay?
- He's safe.

688
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,279
Thank you.

689
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,614
Jim, it's over.

690
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,450
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.

691
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,662
The prosecution's over.
Nobody's standing up in front of a judge...

692
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:30,082
...while judges and police commissioners
are getting blown away.

693
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:33,293
- What about Dent?
- He's got any sense, Dent's halfway to Mex--

694
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,045
So where do you keep your trash?

695
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:40,342
You're due in court. I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record.

696
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:43,554
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.

697
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:47,057
You refuse to cooperate, you're not
coming back here, you go to County.

698
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,685
How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?

699
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:54,606
Targeting me won't get their money.
I knew the Mob wouldn't go down easily...

700
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:58,277
- ...but this is different. They crossed a line.
- You crossed the line first.

701
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:01,864
You squeezed them, you hammered them
to the point of desperation.

702
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:07,035
And in their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

703
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:10,080
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.

704
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,458
We just need to figure out
what he's after.

705
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,042
With respect, Master Wayne...

706
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:17,171
...perhaps this is a man
you don't fully understand either.

707
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,674
Along time ago, I was in Burma...

708
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:24,261
...and my friends and I were working
for the local government.

709
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:27,014
They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders...

710
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:30,017
...by bribing them with precious stones...

711
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:34,772
...but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

712
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:38,233
So we went looking for the stones.

713
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:43,739
But in six months, we never
met anyone who traded with him.

714
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:48,368
One day, I saw a child
playing with a ruby...

715
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:51,580
...the size of a tangerine.

716
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:55,209
The bandit had been
throwing them away.

717
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:58,587
- So why steal them?
- Because he thought it was good sport.

718
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:03,717
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

719
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:08,138
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned or negotiated with.

720
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:12,392
Some men just wanna
watch the world burn.

721
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:33,997
<i>WOMAN“.
Your name, sir?</i>

722
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:37,334
<i>Eighth and Orchard.
You'll find Harvey Dent there.</i>

723
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:51,682
Check the names.

724
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,982
"Richard Dent."

725
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,277
"Patrick Harvey."

726
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,611
Harvey Dent.

727
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,781
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

728
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:11,910
- It's because of you these guys are dead--
- Detective!

729
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:16,164
Give us a minute, guys.

730
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,959
That's brick underneath.

731
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:21,962
- Gonna take ballistics off a shattered bullet?
- No.

732
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,133
Fingerprints.

733
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:36,602
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

734
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:43,108
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

735
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,711
I'm not sure
you made it loud enough, sir.

736
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,935
What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?

737
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:21,897
You wanted me to do the diligence
on the LSI Holdings deal again.

738
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,858
Well, I found some irregularities.

739
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,361
Their CEO is in police custody.

740
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:30,447
No, not with their numbers, with yours.

741
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:35,577
Applied Sciences. Whole division of Wayne
Enterprises just disappeared overnight.

742
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:39,998
I went down to the archives
and I started pulling some old files.

743
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:46,797
Don't tell me you didn't recognize your baby
pancaking cop cars on the evening news.

744
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:50,300
Now you got the entire R & D Department
burning through cash...

745
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,804
...claiming it's related to
cell phones for the Army?

746
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:57,057
What are you building for him now,
a rocket ship?

747
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,686
I want...

748
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:04,773
...$10 million a year
for the rest of my life.

749
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,403
Let me get this straight.

750
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,073
You think that your client...

751
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:18,078
...one of the wealthiest, most powerful men
in the world, is secretly a vigilante...

752
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:22,916
...who spends his nights beating criminals
to a pulp with his bare hands...

753
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:26,253
...and your plan
is to blackmail this person?

754
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:35,012
Good luck.

755
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,307
When--

756
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:42,185
Keep that.

757
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,319
This is your original scan.

758
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:55,032
Here it is reengineered.

759
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:06,793
And there's the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip.

760
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:09,963
I'll get you a copy.

761
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:13,967
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R & D?

762
00:59:14,134 --> 00:59:16,636
Yeah. Government
telecommunications project.

763
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,847
Wasn't aware
we had any government contracts.

764
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:22,100
You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one
pretty close to the chest.

765
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,936
Fair enough.

766
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:30,984
With no word from the Batman,
even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb...

767
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:34,529
...these cops have to wonder if
the Joker will make good on his threat...

768
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,908
...in the obituary column of
The <i>Gotham Times</i> to kill the mayor.

769
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:43,371
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.

770
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,665
Cross-reference the addresses.

771
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:49,836
Look for Parkside,
overlooking the parade.

772
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:52,172
I got one.

773
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:56,343
Melvin White,
1502 Randolph Apartments.

774
00:59:56,718 --> 01:00:00,806
Aggravated assault,
moved to Arkham twice.

775
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,471
What do you got on the roof?

776
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:45,183
We're tight, but frankly,
there's a lot of windows up here.

777
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:57,779
Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement...

778
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:00,240
...and to the protection
of his community.

779
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,200
I remember when I first took office...

780
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,911
...and I asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner.

781
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:10,333
And he said he would, provided
I kept my politics out of his office.

782
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:17,257
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words, nor should he have been.

783
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:21,928
A number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular.

784
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:25,348
Policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters...

785
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:31,396
- Who's that?
- What happened?

786
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,316
They took our guns.

787
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,276
And our uniforms.

788
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:45,619
And as we recognize the sacrifice
of this man...

789
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:49,748
...we must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.

790
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:52,417
Stand by. Honor guard.

791
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:56,213
Attention. Port arms.

792
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:01,801
Ready! Aim! Fire!

793
01:02:02,594 --> 01:02:04,137
Ready! Aim!

794
01:02:07,766 --> 01:02:10,143
Ready! Aim!

795
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,986
Stay down! Don't move!

796
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,490
Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.

797
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,960
- I'll see you later.
- Why are you going back?

798
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:48,640
Get out of here.

799
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,437
Tell me what you know about the Joker.

800
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:26,803
No.

801
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,555
I'm sorry, Barbara.

802
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:32,726
Jimmy, go play with your sister.
Go ahead, honey.

803
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:37,063
If there's anything we can do,
anything you need, we're here for you.

804
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,567
Shh.

805
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:41,985
Are you out there?

806
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,824
Are you? You brought this
craziness on us. You did!

807
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:50,368
You brought this on us!

808
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:55,999
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't wanna talk to us.

809
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:59,419
God help whoever he does wanna talk to.

810
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:04,007
Can't we go someplace quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

811
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:07,010
What makes you think
I wanna hear you talk?

812
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:08,219
What?

813
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:39,250
- Yeah?
- Second.

814
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,460
Okay.

815
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,796
- Harvey, where are you?
<i>- Where</i> are <i>you?</i>

816
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:46,800
I'm where you should be, at Major Crimes.
I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.

817
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:50,553
- Can I get the fingerprint analysis?
<i>-Rachel,</i> listen. You're not safe there.

818
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,514
- This is Gordon's unit.
<i>-Gordon's gone.</i>

819
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,267
- He vouched for these men.
<i>- And</i> he's gone.

820
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,982
<i>The Joker's named you next.</i>

821
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:06,152
<i>God, is there someone, is there anyone
in this town we can trust?</i>

822
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,029
Bruce.

823
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,489
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

824
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:13,243
<i>-No. Rachel, I know you're his friend, but--
Harvey, trust me.</i>

825
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:16,162
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

826
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:17,664
<i>Then you go straight there.</i>

827
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:19,958
<i>Don't tell anybody
and I'll find you there.</i>

828
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:21,835
I love you.

829
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,100
I want the Joker.

830
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,978
From one professional to another...

831
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:42,689
...you're trying to scare somebody,
pick a better spot.

832
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:45,442
From this height,
the fall wouldn't kill me.

833
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,193
- I'm counting on it.
- Huh!

834
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:57,704
- Where is he?
- I don't know where he is. He found us.

835
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,164
He must have friends.

836
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,791
Friends? Have you met this guy?

837
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,543
Someone knows where he is.

838
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,212
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.

839
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:07,714
They're wise to your act.

840
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:11,885
You got rules.
The Joker, he's got no rules.

841
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:16,931
Nobody's gonna cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.

842
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,892
But you already know what that is.

843
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:21,853
Just take off that mask,
let him come find you.

844
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:27,567
Or you can let a couple more people
get killed while you make up your mind.

845
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,237
You wanna play games?

846
01:06:37,577 --> 01:06:38,578
How's that feel?

847
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:41,372
- You wouldn't.
- I wouldn't!

848
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:44,501
- You don't think I will?
- Mm-mm.

849
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,711
- You don't think I will?
- Mm-mm.

850
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:51,299
No. No, I wouldn't.

851
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:55,053
That's why I'm not
gonna leave it up to me.

852
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:59,057
Heads, you get to keep your head.

853
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:01,100
Tails...

854
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,102
...not so lucky.

855
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:07,023
So you wanna tell me about the Joker?

856
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:20,119
- Let's go again.
- I don't know anything! God, don't!

857
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:22,664
You're not playing the odds, friend.

858
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:25,792
Let's do it again.

859
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:30,463
You'd leave a man's life to chance?

860
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:34,801
- Not exactly.
- His name's Schiff, Thomas.

861
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:37,971
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

862
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:42,767
The kind of mind the Joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?

863
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:48,898
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's gonna kill Rachel.

864
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,859
You're the symbol of hope
I could never be.

865
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,861
Your stand against organized crime...

866
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:57,240
...is the first legitimate ray of light
in Gotham in decades.

867
01:07:57,407 --> 01:08:01,035
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

868
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,496
The criminals you arrested
would be released...

869
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:06,749
...and Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.

870
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,627
You're gonna hold
a press conference tomorrow.

871
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,171
—Why?
- No one else will die because of me.

872
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,674
Gotham's in your hands now.

873
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:16,551
You can't.

874
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:18,094
You can't give in.

875
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:20,930
You can't give in!

876
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:37,530
Harvey called.

877
01:08:37,697 --> 01:08:40,742
He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.

878
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,035
I have no choice.

879
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:45,288
You honestly think that's gonna
keep the Joker from killing people?

880
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:48,916
Maybe not. But I have enough blood
on my hands.

881
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:54,213
And I've seen now what I would
have to become to stop men like him.

882
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:58,217
You once told me that
if the day came when I was finished...

883
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,470
...that we'd be together.

884
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:04,349
Bruce, don't make me
your one hope for a normal life.

885
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,226
Did you mean it?

886
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,563
Yes.

887
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,624
Bruce.

888
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:34,504
If you turn yourself in,
they're not gonna let us be together.

889
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:48,101
- Logs as well?
- Everything.

890
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:51,646
Anything that could lead back
to Lucius or Rachel.

891
01:09:56,984 --> 01:10:00,279
People are dying, Alfred.
What would you have me do?

892
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:04,200
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.

893
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:08,079
They'll hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.

894
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:13,793
He can be the outcast. He can make
the choice that no one else can make.

895
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,294
The right choice.

896
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:18,840
No, today I found out
what Batman can't do.

897
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,258
He can't endure this.

898
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:23,428
Today you get to say "I told you so."

899
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:27,181
Today, I don't want to.

900
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,480
But I did bloody tell you.

901
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:40,528
I suppose they're gonna
look me up as well...

902
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,572
...as your accomplice.

903
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:47,493
Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

904
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:55,293
Ladies and gentlemen, I've called
this press conference for two reasons.

905
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,503
Firstly, to assure the citizens
of Gotham...

906
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:01,340
...that everything that can be done
over the Joker killings is being done.

907
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:05,803
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

908
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,680
<i>But let's consider the situation.</i>

909
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:10,683
Should we give in
to this terrorist's demands?

910
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,310
Do we really think he's gonna--?

911
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:15,855
You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens?

912
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:18,399
The Batman is an outlaw.

913
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:23,029
That's not why we demand he turn himself
in, we're doing it because we're scared.

914
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:25,990
We've been happy to let Batman
clean up our streets till now.

915
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:29,118
- Things are worse than ever!
- Amen.

916
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,371
Yes, they are.

917
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:37,877
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

918
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:42,423
And I promise you...

919
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:44,634
...the dawn is coming.

920
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:49,347
One day, the Batman will have to answer
for the laws he's broken. But to us...

921
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:51,265
...not to this madman.

922
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:53,768
- No more dead cops!
- Yeah!

923
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:58,648
He should turn himself in!

924
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:01,526
- Give us the Batman! Come on!
- Where is he?

925
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,572
So be it. Take the Batman into custody.

926
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:08,991
- What?
- Is he here?

927
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:10,743
I am the Batman.

928
01:12:11,077 --> 01:12:14,080
- What?
- Come on.

929
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:24,382
Alfred.

930
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,510
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

931
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:30,680
- He went down to the press conference.
- I know. He just stood by.

932
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:32,932
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...

933
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:36,102
...believe that Batman stands for
something more important...

934
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:38,604
...than the whims of a terrorist,
Miss Dawes...

935
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,773
...even if everyone hates him for it.

936
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:43,067
That's the sacrifice he's making.

937
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:46,863
He's not being a hero.
He's being something more.

938
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:49,031
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

939
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,285
Letting Harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all.

940
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,581
You know him better than anyone.

941
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:58,040
I do.

942
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:04,463
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right?

943
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,133
How will I know?

944
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,801
It's not sealed.

945
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,762
Goodbye, Alfred.

946
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:17,685
Bye, Rachel.

947
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:27,445
I didn't have time to talk this through.

948
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:31,073
- What are you doing?
- They're transferring me to Central Holding.

949
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:35,036
This is the Joker's chance, and when he
attacks, the Batman will take him down.

950
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:36,746
Listen. This is too dangerous.

951
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:40,625
We get this guy to County, he's their
problem. The streets will be cleared...

952
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:44,503
...so let's go.
The convoys stop for no reason.

953
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,130
I hope you got some moves, pal.

954
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:50,468
He's using you as bait. He doesn't know
if he can get the Joker. He's failed so far.

955
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:54,847
- How do you know what he's thinking?
- I just do. Anyway, this isn't just about you.

956
01:13:55,014 --> 01:14:00,019
What about the people depending on you to
clean the city up and do it honorably and--?

957
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:08,319
Harvey. Tell everyone the truth.

958
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,571
Heads, I go through with it.

959
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:14,700
This is your life. You can't
leave something like that to chance.

960
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:16,202
I'm not.

961
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,999
You make your own luck.

962
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:45,815
Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.

963
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:55,783
What the hell is that?

964
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:58,160
Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!

965
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:01,539
Damn it! All units divert down
onto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down.

966
01:15:01,956 --> 01:15:03,082
<i>Exit down!</i>

967
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:05,584
Lower Fifth? We'll be
like turkeys on Thanksgiving.

968
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:40,619
Jesus. Come on, get us out of here.
Let's go.

969
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:45,166
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.

970
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:46,876
We got trouble, guys.

971
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:50,880
Lock and load!

972
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:03,476
The hell was that?

973
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:28,000
- These are built for that, right?
- He'll need something...

974
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:29,960
...a lot bigger to get through this.

975
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:32,463
What is that?

976
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:35,132
What is that, a bazooka?

977
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:45,476
I didn't sign up for this!

978
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:03,160
Look out.

979
01:17:03,953 --> 01:17:05,121
Look out!

980
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,463
Hmm.

981
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:28,519
Come on, let's go!

982
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:17,318
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.

983
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:20,321
Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.

984
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:28,829
<i>Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.</i>

985
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:38,422
We gotta get topside.
We need air support, now!

986
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:45,804
I like this job. I like it.

987
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:50,684
<i>Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.</i>

988
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:06,158
<i>Goodbye.</i>

989
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:18,462
We're on point, ready to give them
some of their own medicine.

990
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:27,304
That's what I'm talking about. Air cav.

991
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:42,569
Okay, rack them up.

992
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:45,114
<i>Rack them up, rack them up,
rack them up.</i>

993
01:20:10,848 --> 01:20:12,016
That's not good.

994
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:16,729
Okay, that's not good!

995
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,940
Now, there's a Batman.

996
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:07,446
Ooh, you wanna play. Come on.

997
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:11,492
Come on.

998
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:21,877
He missed!

999
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:38,227
You can't stop here.
We're like sitting ducks!

1000
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:56,328
Come on, come on.

1001
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:02,835
Come on. Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on!

1002
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:06,839
Come on.

1003
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:10,843
Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on, hit me.

1004
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:12,636
Come on, hit me. Come on, hit me!

1005
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:15,806
Hit me!

1006
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:44,042
Come on, come on. Aah!

1007
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,462
Could you please just give me a minute?

1008
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:50,382
We got you, you son of a bitch.

1009
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:57,598
Gor-- You do like to play things
pretty close to the chest.

1010
01:22:58,056 --> 01:22:59,766
We got him, Harvey.

1011
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:03,395
Mr. Dent! How does it feel
to be the biggest hero in Gotham?

1012
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:06,857
No, I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.

1013
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:10,194
But you and your office have
been working with the Batman all along.

1014
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,197
- No, but I trusted him to do the right thing.
- Which was?

1015
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:14,406
Saving my ass.

1016
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:17,493
All right, people, that's enough.
Let him be. Let him be.

1017
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:19,578
Thank you, detective.

1018
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:21,914
I've got a date
with a pretty upset girlfriend.

1019
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,458
- I figured, counselor.
- Mr. Dent, sir...

1020
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:28,754
- ...how about one for the front page, sir?
- Mr. Dent.

1021
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:43,268
Stand away! All of you!

1022
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:46,939
I don't want anything for his Mob lawyer
to use, you understand?

1023
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:51,068
Back from the dead.

1024
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,278
I, uh...

1025
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:55,364
...couldn't risk my family's safety.

1026
01:23:56,657 --> 01:23:58,492
What do we got?

1027
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:04,122
Nothing. No matches on prints,
DNA, dental.

1028
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:07,042
Clothing is custom, no labels.

1029
01:24:07,251 --> 01:24:09,378
Nothing in his pockets
but knives and lint.

1030
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:11,463
No name.

1031
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:13,757
- No other alias.
- Go home, Gordon.

1032
01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:17,010
The clown'll keep till morning.
Go get some rest.

1033
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:19,012
You're gonna need it.

1034
01:24:19,263 --> 01:24:21,848
Tomorrow you take the big job.

1035
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:25,686
You don't have any say in the matter.
Commissioner Gordon.

1036
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:43,662
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety.

1037
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:51,587
Look at these ugly bastards.

1038
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:53,630
- I don't feel good.
- You're a cop killer.

1039
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:56,133
You're lucky to be feeling anything
below the neck.

1040
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,884
- Please!
- Step away from the bars!

1041
01:24:58,051 --> 01:25:00,220
My insides hurt.

1042
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:16,194
Did Batman save you, Daddy?

1043
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:20,657
Actually, this time...

1044
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:22,993
...I saved him.

1045
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:35,964
Has he said anything yet?

1046
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:47,768
Evening, commissioner.

1047
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,611
Harvey Dent never made it home.

1048
01:25:57,778 --> 01:25:59,905
- Of course not.
- What have you done with him?

1049
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:02,574
Me?

1050
01:26:04,201 --> 01:26:06,328
I was right here.

1051
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:09,581
Who did you leave him with?

1052
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:12,584
Hm? Your people?

1053
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:17,047
Assuming, of course,
that they are still your people...

1054
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:19,925
...and not Maroni's.

1055
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:24,513
Does it depress you, commissioner...

1056
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:29,893
...to know just how alone you really are?

1057
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:36,775
Does it make you feel responsible
for Harvey Dent's current predicament?

1058
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:39,611
- Where is he?
- What's the time?

1059
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:41,613
What difference does that make?

1060
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:47,327
Well, depending on the time,
he may be in one spot or several.

1061
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:56,670
- If we're gonna play games...
- Mm-hm?

1062
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,800
...I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.

1063
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:06,054
Ah, the "good cop, bad cop" routine?

1064
01:27:06,722 --> 01:27:07,764
Not exactly.

1065
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:22,320
Never start with the head. The victim
gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next--

1066
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:26,616
See?

1067
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:29,119
You wanted me. Here I am.

1068
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:32,289
<i>I wanted to see What you'd do.</i>

1069
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:35,417
And you didn't disappoint.

1070
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:38,420
You let five people die.

1071
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:43,049
Then you let Dent take your place.

1072
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:45,844
- Even to a guy like me, that's cold.
- Where's Dent?

1073
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:50,807
Those Mob fools want you gone so
they can get back to the way things were.

1074
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:56,062
But I know the truth. There's no going back.
You've changed things.

1075
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:58,648
- Forever.
- Then why do you wanna kill me?

1076
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:03,028
I don't wanna kill you.

1077
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:08,074
What would I do without you?
Go back to ripping off Mob dealers? No, no.

1078
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:10,619
No. No, you...

1079
01:28:10,786 --> 01:28:13,205
You complete me.

1080
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:17,709
- You're garbage who kills for money.
- Don't talk like one of them. You're not.

1081
01:28:17,876 --> 01:28:20,295
Even if you'd like to be.

1082
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:23,381
To them, you're just a freak...

1083
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:25,634
...like me.

1084
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:28,094
They need you right now...

1085
01:28:28,678 --> 01:28:30,722
...but when they don't...

1086
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:34,309
...they'll cast you out like a leper.

1087
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:38,396
You see, their morals, their code...

1088
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:40,816
...it's a bad joke.

1089
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:44,402
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.

1090
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:49,074
They're only as good as the world
allows them to be. I'll show you.

1091
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:52,410
When the chips are down, these--

1092
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:54,830
These civilized people...

1093
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:57,082
...they'll eat each other.

1094
01:28:57,791 --> 01:29:00,168
See, I'm not a monster.

1095
01:29:01,545 --> 01:29:02,838
I'm just ahead of the curve.

1096
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:06,174
Where's Dent?

1097
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:09,261
You have all these rules,
and you think they'll save you.

1098
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,766
- He's in control.
- I have one rule.

1099
01:29:14,933 --> 01:29:18,019
Oh. Then that's the rule you'll have to break
to know the truth.

1100
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:19,354
Which is?

1101
01:29:19,521 --> 01:29:21,940
The only sensible way to live
is without rules.

1102
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:24,776
And tonight you're gonna break
your one rule.

1103
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:25,986
I'm considering it.

1104
01:29:26,152 --> 01:29:28,780
There's only minutes left,
so you'll have to play my game...

1105
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:31,533
...if you wanna save one of them.

1106
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:33,076
"Them"?

1107
01:29:33,243 --> 01:29:37,289
You know, for a while there,
I thought you really were Dent.

1108
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:40,083
The way you threw yourself after her.

1109
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:47,465
Look at you go.

1110
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:56,683
Does Harvey know
about you and his little bunny?

1111
01:29:57,601 --> 01:29:58,977
Where are they?!

1112
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:01,146
Killing is making a choice.

1113
01:30:01,313 --> 01:30:04,399
- Where are they?!
- Choose between one life or the other.

1114
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:09,404
Your friend the district attorney,
or his blushing bride-to-be.

1115
01:30:14,576 --> 01:30:18,663
You have nothing,
nothing to threaten me with.

1116
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:22,584
Nothing to do with all your strength.

1117
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:26,212
Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you
where they are, both of them.

1118
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:29,424
And that's the point.
You'll have to choose.

1119
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:33,011
He's at 25052nd Street...

1120
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:36,514
...and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.

1121
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:40,352
- Which one you going after?
- Rachel.

1122
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:43,188
We're getting Dent!

1123
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,318
25052nd Street!

1124
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:53,031
<i>Hello?</i>

1125
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:56,368
<i>Can anybody hear me?</i>

1126
01:30:58,787 --> 01:31:01,414
<i>Hello!</i>

1127
01:31:05,418 --> 01:31:07,671
- Rachel?
- Harvey.

1128
01:31:07,837 --> 01:31:10,048
Oh, Harvey, thank God. Are you okay?

1129
01:31:10,215 --> 01:31:11,800
I'm all right. I'm in a--

1130
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:15,553
I'm in a warehouse.
They got me wired to these oil drums.

1131
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:17,806
I am too.

1132
01:31:18,348 --> 01:31:20,058
<i>Harvey.</i>

1133
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:29,776
I want my phone call.

1134
01:31:29,943 --> 01:31:32,737
I want it. I want it. I want my phone call.

1135
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:35,240
That's nice.

1136
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:41,579
How many of your friends have I killed?

1137
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:46,418
I'm a 20-year man...

1138
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:50,046
...and I know the difference between
punks who need a lesson in manners...

1139
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:53,091
...and the freaks like you
who would just enjoy it.

1140
01:31:53,967 --> 01:31:56,428
And you killed six of my friends.

1141
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:57,595
<i>Six?</i>

1142
01:31:57,762 --> 01:32:00,265
Please. My insides hurt.

1143
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:02,183
I don't really care. Back away.

1144
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:05,520
The boss said he'd make the voices
go away.

1145
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:09,232
He said he'd go inside
and replace them with bright lights...

1146
01:32:09,399 --> 01:32:10,525
...like Christmas.

1147
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:13,236
You're out of your mind, pal. Back off.

1148
01:32:13,403 --> 01:32:16,239
Medic to the holding tank.
Come on. Get the door open.

1149
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:17,615
You guys, back off!

1150
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:19,951
Listen, we don't have a lot of time.

1151
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:24,122
They told me that only one of us
was gonna make it...

1152
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:27,625
...and that they were gonna
let our friends choose.

1153
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:32,464
Okay, Rachel.

1154
01:32:33,048 --> 01:32:36,176
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be all right.
They're coming for you.

1155
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:40,638
Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk me
through what's going on with you.

1156
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:44,309
<i>-Can you find something, anything, sharp?</i>
- I'm trying.

1157
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:46,644
—What's——?
<i>-Shit.</i>

1158
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:48,313
Harvey?

1159
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:53,735
Harvey, what's happening?

1160
01:33:03,078 --> 01:33:06,915
All available units,
converge at 25052nd Street.

1161
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:11,336
Do you wanna know why I use a knife?

1162
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:14,964
Guns are too quick.

1163
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:18,510
You can't savor all the...

1164
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:22,013
...little emotions.

1165
01:33:23,932 --> 01:33:28,812
You see, in their last moments...

1166
01:33:28,978 --> 01:33:31,272
...people show you who they really are.

1167
01:33:32,357 --> 01:33:38,029
So in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.

1168
01:33:41,783 --> 01:33:45,203
Would you like to know
which of them were cowards?

1169
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:53,378
- What's that?
- Jeez.

1170
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:55,630
He's got some kind of a...

1171
01:33:55,797 --> 01:33:59,008
- ...contusion.
- I know you're gonna enjoy this.

1172
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:04,139
I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it
even more.

1173
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:10,645
Whoa, whoa!

1174
01:34:11,688 --> 01:34:12,730
Just put it down.

1175
01:34:12,897 --> 01:34:15,692
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Drop the weapon now!

1176
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:19,821
- It's my own damn fault, just shoot him!
- Let him go now! Drop it!

1177
01:34:20,113 --> 01:34:23,116
- What? Sorry?
- What do you want?

1178
01:34:24,159 --> 01:34:26,077
I just want my phone call.

1179
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,749
<i>RACHEL“.
What--? What—-? What's happening?</i>

1180
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:34,752
<i>Just talk to me, just for one second.</i>

1181
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:39,757
- All right?
- Right.

1182
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,094
Ow.

1183
01:34:44,012 --> 01:34:45,597
—Ow.
- Shh, shh, Shh.

1184
01:34:51,561 --> 01:34:53,605
Is that a phone?

1185
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:04,616
Mount the curb!

1186
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:16,628
Harvey, just in case,
I wanna tell you something, okay?

1187
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:18,588
<i>Don't think like that. They're coming.</i>

1188
01:35:18,755 --> 01:35:21,049
I know they are,
but I don't want them to.

1189
01:35:25,470 --> 01:35:29,557
I don't wanna live without you,
and I do have an answer for you.

1190
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:31,726
My answer is yes.

1191
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:37,232
No!No!No!

1192
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:40,026
<i>Not me! Why are you coming for me?</i>

1193
01:35:40,193 --> 01:35:41,236
<i>No!</i>

1194
01:35:42,904 --> 01:35:44,489
Rachel! Rachel!

1195
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:47,033
- Harvey.
<i>-No! No! Rachel!</i>

1196
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,243
Okay.

1197
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:49,494
Rachel!

1198
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:51,454
<i>No! No!</i>

1199
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:55,750
Harvey, it's okay. It's all right. Listen.

1200
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:57,252
Somewh--

1201
01:36:03,132 --> 01:36:04,342
No, commissioner!

1202
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:07,178
Rachel! No!

1203
01:36:21,526 --> 01:36:22,652
Hello there.

1204
01:36:28,533 --> 01:36:32,036
Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.

1205
01:36:32,954 --> 01:36:34,664
With Lau?

1206
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:40,044
The Joker planned to be caught.

1207
01:36:40,378 --> 01:36:42,547
He wanted me to lock him up
in the MCU.

1208
01:37:02,191 --> 01:37:04,235
<i>RACHEL“.
Dear Bruce:</i>

1209
01:37:05,987 --> 01:37:08,531
<i>I need to be honest and clear.</i>

1210
01:37:10,575 --> 01:37:13,119
<i>I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.</i>

1211
01:37:13,286 --> 01:37:17,206
<i>I love him, and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with him.</i>

1212
01:37:17,749 --> 01:37:22,170
<i>When I told you that if Gotham no longer
needed Batman, we could be together...</i>

1213
01:37:22,337 --> 01:37:24,547
<i>...I meant it.</i>

1214
01:37:24,797 --> 01:37:29,552
<i>But now I'm sure the day won't come
when you no longer need Batman.</i>

1215
01:37:30,595 --> 01:37:32,513
<i>I hope it does.</i>

1216
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:35,433
<i>And if it does, I will be there...</i>

1217
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:37,393
<i>...but as your friend.</i>

1218
01:37:38,102 --> 01:37:40,355
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1219
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:42,899
<i>RACHEL“.
I'm sorry to let you down.</i>

1220
01:37:43,066 --> 01:37:48,071
<i>If you lose your faith in me,
please keep your faith in people.</i>

1221
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:53,076
<i>Love, now and always, Rachel.</i>

1222
01:38:01,042 --> 01:38:03,378
Prepared a little breakfast.

1223
01:38:07,507 --> 01:38:09,425
- Very well, then.
- Alfred.

1224
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:10,760
Yes, Master Wayne?

1225
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:14,389
Did I bring this on her?

1226
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:17,642
I was meant to inspire good...

1227
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:20,186
...not madness, not death.

1228
01:38:20,353 --> 01:38:24,982
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the faces of Gotham's criminals.

1229
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:27,235
Didn't you think
there might be casualties?

1230
01:38:27,402 --> 01:38:29,821
Things always get worse
before they get better.

1231
01:38:30,154 --> 01:38:31,614
But Rachel, Alfred.

1232
01:38:31,781 --> 01:38:35,576
Rachel believed in what you stood for...

1233
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:37,662
...what we stand for.

1234
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:39,288
Gotham needs you.

1235
01:38:39,831 --> 01:38:42,792
No, Gotham needs its true hero...

1236
01:38:43,292 --> 01:38:47,422
...and I let that murdering psychopath
blow him half to hell.

1237
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:49,924
Which is why, for now...

1238
01:38:50,716 --> 01:38:52,635
...they're gonna have to
make do with you.

1239
01:38:54,846 --> 01:38:56,681
She was gonna wait for me, Alfred.

1240
01:38:58,683 --> 01:39:00,726
Dent doesn't know.

1241
01:39:00,893 --> 01:39:02,186
He can never know.

1242
01:39:04,605 --> 01:39:06,232
What's that?

1243
01:39:06,399 --> 01:39:09,360
- It can wait.
- That bandit...

1244
01:39:09,819 --> 01:39:11,946
...in the forest in Burma.

1245
01:39:12,113 --> 01:39:14,157
- Did you catch him?
- Yes.

1246
01:39:14,323 --> 01:39:15,658
How?

1247
01:39:17,076 --> 01:39:18,703
We burned the forest down.

1248
01:39:57,909 --> 01:40:00,578
<i>He's credible, an M & A lawyer
from a leading consultancy.</i>

1249
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:04,123
<i>He says he's waited as long as he can
for Batman to do the right thing.</i>

1250
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:06,375
<i>Now he's taking matters
into his own hands.</i>

1251
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:09,504
<i>We'll be live at 5 with
the true identity of the Batman.</i>

1252
01:40:25,937 --> 01:40:27,563
I'm sorry about Rachel.

1253
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:35,112
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but that you won't accept medication.

1254
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:38,115
That you're refusing to...

1255
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:40,034
...accept skin grafts.

1256
01:40:40,368 --> 01:40:42,620
Remember that name...

1257
01:40:43,204 --> 01:40:45,540
...you all had for me...

1258
01:40:45,998 --> 01:40:48,834
...when I was at Internal Affairs?

1259
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:52,588
What was it, Gordon?

1260
01:40:53,256 --> 01:40:54,632
Harvey, I...

1261
01:40:54,799 --> 01:40:56,300
Say it.

1262
01:40:57,718 --> 01:40:59,637
Say it!

1263
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:10,398
Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.

1264
01:41:11,983 --> 01:41:16,279
Why should I hide who I am?

1265
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:18,823
I know you tried to warn me.

1266
01:41:19,699 --> 01:41:20,908
I'm sorry.

1267
01:41:21,534 --> 01:41:24,161
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?

1268
01:41:26,455 --> 01:41:28,833
Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1269
01:41:29,667 --> 01:41:32,670
Harvey, I need to know
which of my men I can trust.

1270
01:41:33,045 --> 01:41:35,172
Why would you listen to me now?

1271
01:41:36,299 --> 01:41:37,967
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1272
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:42,305
No.

1273
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:44,890
No, you're not.

1274
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:47,184
Not yet.

1275
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:55,151
This craziness, it's too much.

1276
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,613
Should've thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.

1277
01:41:58,779 --> 01:42:00,531
You want him?

1278
01:42:02,992 --> 01:42:05,369
I can tell you
where he'll be this afternoon.

1279
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:15,671
Not so crazy as you look.

1280
01:42:15,838 --> 01:42:19,592
I told you, I'm a man of my word.

1281
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:24,055
Where is the Italian?

1282
01:42:24,221 --> 01:42:27,350
All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.

1283
01:42:27,516 --> 01:42:30,978
I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.

1284
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:32,730
Please.

1285
01:42:32,897 --> 01:42:36,233
Joker-man, what you do
with all your money?

1286
01:42:36,901 --> 01:42:39,570
You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.

1287
01:42:39,737 --> 01:42:41,405
I enjoy...

1288
01:42:41,572 --> 01:42:42,948
...dynamite...

1289
01:42:43,115 --> 01:42:44,659
...and gunpowder...

1290
01:42:45,117 --> 01:42:47,536
...and gasoline.

1291
01:42:48,996 --> 01:42:51,248
- What the--?
- Ah, ah, ah.

1292
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:55,920
And you know the thing
that they have in common?

1293
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:57,713
They're cheap.

1294
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:00,549
<i>How much are they
paying you to say who Batman is?</i>

1295
01:43:00,716 --> 01:43:04,679
This is our chance. I want Lau alive.
The Joker, either way.

1296
01:43:04,845 --> 01:43:06,263
Hey, Jim. Get a load of this.

1297
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:07,765
<i>Let's take the next caller.</i>

1298
01:43:07,932 --> 01:43:10,101
<i>Harvey Dent didn't wanna
give in to this maniac.</i>

1299
01:43:10,267 --> 01:43:11,560
<i>You think you know better?</i>

1300
01:43:11,727 --> 01:43:15,106
<i>I think that if we could talk to Dent today,
he may feel differently.</i>

1301
01:43:15,272 --> 01:43:19,360
<i>And we wish him a speedy recovery.
Because God knows, we need him now.</i>

1302
01:43:19,527 --> 01:43:21,737
You said you were a man of your word.

1303
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:24,073
Oh, I am.

1304
01:43:25,783 --> 01:43:28,452
I'm only burning my half.

1305
01:43:29,787 --> 01:43:31,914
All you care about is money.

1306
01:43:32,081 --> 01:43:35,543
This town deserves
a better class of criminal...

1307
01:43:35,710 --> 01:43:37,962
...and I'm gonna give it to them.

1308
01:43:38,754 --> 01:43:41,257
Tell your men they work for me now.

1309
01:43:41,424 --> 01:43:43,801
This is my city.

1310
01:43:44,468 --> 01:43:47,012
They won't work for a freak.

1311
01:43:47,179 --> 01:43:48,889
"Freak."

1312
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:51,517
Why don't we cut you up into little pieces...

1313
01:43:51,684 --> 01:43:53,144
...and feed you to your pooches? Hm?

1314
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:56,188
And then we'll see how loyal
a hungry dog really is.

1315
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:00,526
It's not about money...

1316
01:44:00,693 --> 01:44:03,904
...it's about sending a message.

1317
01:44:04,697 --> 01:44:07,158
Everything burns.

1318
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,829
<i>-Who is this?
JOKER“. I had a vision...</i>

1319
01:44:11,996 --> 01:44:14,749
<i>...of a world without Batman.</i>

1320
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:17,168
<i>The Mob ground out a little profit...</i>

1321
01:44:17,334 --> 01:44:21,255
<i>...and the police tried to shut them down
one block at a time.</i>

1322
01:44:21,422 --> 01:44:24,717
<i>And it was so boring.</i>

1323
01:44:24,884 --> 01:44:26,844
<i>I've had a change of heart.</i>

1324
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:29,638
<i>I don't want Mr. Reese
spoiling everything...</i>

1325
01:44:29,805 --> 01:44:34,518
<i>...but why should I have all the fun?
Let's give someone else a chance.</i>

1326
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:39,523
<i>If Coleman Reese
isn't dead in 60 minutes...</i>

1327
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:41,776
<i>...then I blow up a hospital.</i>

1328
01:44:41,942 --> 01:44:43,527
Call in every officer.

1329
01:44:43,694 --> 01:44:47,031
Tell them to head to their nearest hospital
and start evac and search.

1330
01:44:47,198 --> 01:44:51,118
Call the transit authority, school board,
prisons. Get every bus down to a hospital.

1331
01:44:51,285 --> 01:44:55,873
The priority is Gotham General. Wheel
everybody out of that place right now.

1332
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,708
You, you and you, you come with me.

1333
01:44:57,875 --> 01:44:59,794
- Where are we going, sir?
- To get Reese.

1334
01:45:00,044 --> 01:45:03,172
I need you plugged in,
checking Gordon's men and their families.

1335
01:45:03,339 --> 01:45:05,549
- Looking for?
- Hospital admissions.

1336
01:45:05,716 --> 01:45:07,384
Will you be wanting the Batpod?

1337
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:09,512
In the middle of the day?
Not very subtle.

1338
01:45:09,678 --> 01:45:10,971
The Lamborghini, then.

1339
01:45:11,889 --> 01:45:13,015
Much more subtle.

1340
01:45:26,862 --> 01:45:29,365
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me. Okay.

1341
01:45:29,532 --> 01:45:33,035
Sir, could you help, please?

1342
01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:34,912
I'm gonna find a bus for him.

1343
01:45:36,872 --> 01:45:38,749
Sir? Commissioner, do you really think...

1344
01:45:38,916 --> 01:45:41,085
...an ordinary citizen
would try to kill this man?

1345
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:47,925
Sir. Commissioner.

1346
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:52,221
Get the cars around the back!

1347
01:45:54,598 --> 01:45:55,933
Go. Keep rolling, Sam.

1348
01:46:01,897 --> 01:46:03,858
I see O'Brien and Richards.

1349
01:46:04,441 --> 01:46:07,945
No immediate family member
admitted to a Gotham hospital.

1350
01:46:09,238 --> 01:46:12,783
- They're trying to kill me.
- Well, maybe Batman can save you.

1351
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:28,549
Davis, they got space. Bring him out.

1352
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:32,011
Davis.

1353
01:46:37,141 --> 01:46:39,476
I saw Burns and Zachary.

1354
01:46:39,643 --> 01:46:40,853
<i>Nothing on them.</i>

1355
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:42,479
And a patrolman I don't know.

1356
01:46:43,689 --> 01:46:45,608
Okay, so, what now?

1357
01:46:46,483 --> 01:46:48,736
What do we do now?
Where are we going?

1358
01:46:51,488 --> 01:46:53,157
Send the information to Gordon.

1359
01:47:00,998 --> 01:47:02,583
Get out of here.

1360
01:47:04,627 --> 01:47:06,420
Davis.

1361
01:47:09,590 --> 01:47:12,009
Ma'am, we're gonna have to
move him now.

1362
01:47:23,687 --> 01:47:26,023
- It's Berg, isn't it?
- Commissioner.

1363
01:47:27,149 --> 01:47:28,609
You okay, son?

1364
01:47:46,627 --> 01:47:48,212
Hi.

1365
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:54,551
You know...

1366
01:47:55,386 --> 01:47:58,472
...I don't want there to be
any hard feelings between us, Harvey.

1367
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:01,767
- When you and--
- Rachel!

1368
01:48:01,934 --> 01:48:04,228
- -Rachel were being abducted...

1369
01:48:04,395 --> 01:48:07,398
...I was sitting in Gordon's cage.

1370
01:48:07,731 --> 01:48:09,650
I didn't rig those charges.

1371
01:48:09,858 --> 01:48:12,319
Your men, your plan.

1372
01:48:12,528 --> 01:48:14,989
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

1373
01:48:15,406 --> 01:48:18,200
You know what I am?
I'm a dog chasing cars.

1374
01:48:18,826 --> 01:48:21,286
I wouldn't know what to do with one
if I caught it.

1375
01:48:21,453 --> 01:48:24,581
You know? I just do things.

1376
01:48:24,957 --> 01:48:28,669
The Mob has plans. The cops have plans.

1377
01:48:28,836 --> 01:48:31,046
Gordon's got plans.

1378
01:48:31,213 --> 01:48:34,174
You know, they're schemers.

1379
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:38,095
Schemers trying to control
their little worlds.

1380
01:48:38,262 --> 01:48:39,763
I'm not a schemer.

1381
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:41,557
I try to show the schemers...

1382
01:48:41,724 --> 01:48:47,021
...how pathetic their attempts
to control things really are.

1383
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:51,025
So when I say-- Ah. Come here.

1384
01:48:51,525 --> 01:48:55,070
When I say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal...

1385
01:48:56,613 --> 01:48:58,824
...you'll know that I'm telling the truth.

1386
01:49:01,326 --> 01:49:04,121
- I'm gonna need your weapon.
- What?

1387
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:09,710
Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?

1388
01:49:10,419 --> 01:49:11,962
Yeah, that'd be why.

1389
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:16,091
It's the schemers
that put you where you are.

1390
01:49:16,258 --> 01:49:20,054
You were a schemer, you had plans...

1391
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:22,389
...and look where that got you.

1392
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:35,527
<i>Police are taking every precaution...</i>

1393
01:49:35,694 --> 01:49:37,821
<i>...urging people not to
take matters into their hands.</i>

1394
01:49:37,988 --> 01:49:40,532
I just did what I do best.

1395
01:49:40,699 --> 01:49:44,328
I took your little plan
and I turned it on itself.

1396
01:49:44,495 --> 01:49:49,833
Look what I did to this city with
a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets.

1397
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,295
Hm? You know what I noticed?

1398
01:49:53,462 --> 01:49:57,007
Nobody panics when
things go "according to plan."

1399
01:49:57,174 --> 01:49:58,842
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1400
01:49:59,468 --> 01:50:04,515
If tomorrow I tell the press that, like,
a gangbanger will get shot...

1401
01:50:04,681 --> 01:50:08,143
...or a truckload of soldiers
will be blowing up...

1402
01:50:08,435 --> 01:50:09,520
...nobody panics.

1403
01:50:10,229 --> 01:50:13,315
Because it's all part of the plan.

1404
01:50:13,482 --> 01:50:18,403
But when I say that
one little old mayor will die...

1405
01:50:18,654 --> 01:50:21,073
...well, then, everyone loses their minds.

1406
01:50:24,493 --> 01:50:27,412
Introduce a little anarchy...

1407
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:30,833
...upset the established order...

1408
01:50:30,999 --> 01:50:35,546
...and everything becomes chaos.

1409
01:50:37,381 --> 01:50:40,134
I'm an agent of chaos.

1410
01:50:40,509 --> 01:50:42,845
Oh, and you know the thing
about chaos?

1411
01:50:44,888 --> 01:50:46,515
It's fair.

1412
01:50:55,732 --> 01:50:58,902
- You live.
- Mm-hm.

1413
01:50:59,403 --> 01:51:01,029
You die.

1414
01:51:01,238 --> 01:51:03,240
Mmm. Now we're talking.

1415
01:51:12,583 --> 01:51:14,084
Mr. Reese.

1416
01:51:32,269 --> 01:51:34,438
That's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

1417
01:51:34,605 --> 01:51:37,608
- That was a very brave thing you did.
- Trying to catch the light?

1418
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:40,777
- You weren't protecting the van?
- Why? Who's in it?

1419
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:48,327
Don't you think
I should go to the hospital?

1420
01:51:48,493 --> 01:51:50,996
Don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr. Wayne?

1421
01:52:57,145 --> 01:52:58,981
Southeast.

1422
01:52:59,147 --> 01:53:01,358
It's Gotham General.

1423
01:53:02,109 --> 01:53:03,777
- Did you clear the building?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1424
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:10,033
You must know how many
were inside. You have patient lists, roll call.

1425
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:12,536
Right now we're showing
50 people missing. One bus.

1426
01:53:12,703 --> 01:53:15,872
The other buses were heading off to
hospitals. I guess we missed one.

1427
01:53:16,039 --> 01:53:18,166
What's your guess
about where Harvey Dent is?

1428
01:53:18,333 --> 01:53:22,796
Keep looking. And keep it to yourself.
Anybody asks, we got him out.

1429
01:53:25,382 --> 01:53:27,801
Get me the mayor's office on the line.

1430
01:53:28,969 --> 01:53:30,721
We're gonna need the National Guard.

1431
01:53:30,887 --> 01:53:33,890
<i>people are still
missing, including GCN's own Mike Engel.</i>

1432
01:53:34,057 --> 01:53:37,311
<i>I'm now being told that we're cutting to
a video GCN has just received.</i>

1433
01:53:37,477 --> 01:53:39,396
I'm <i>Mike Engel</i> for Gotham Tonight.

1434
01:53:39,896 --> 01:53:43,233
<i>"What does it take
to make you people wanna join in?</i>

1435
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:45,986
<i>You failed to kill the lawyer.
I've gotta get you off the bench...</i>

1436
01:53:46,153 --> 01:53:47,904
<i>- ...and into the game.</i>
<i>- Bench.</i> Game.

1437
01:53:50,073 --> 01:53:52,200
- Come <i>nightfall, this city is mine.</i>
<i>- Mine.</i>

1438
01:53:52,367 --> 01:53:55,120
<i>—And anyone left here plays by my rules.
- Rules.</i>

1439
01:53:55,412 --> 01:53:58,749
Mr. Fox? Security is showing
a break-in at the R & D Department.

1440
01:53:58,915 --> 01:54:01,043
<i>If you don't wanna be in the game...</i>

1441
01:54:01,209 --> 01:54:02,586
- ... <i>get out now.
- Get out now.</i>

1442
01:54:04,755 --> 01:54:07,716
<i>But the bridge—and—tunnel crowd
are sure in for a surprise.</i>

1443
01:54:08,091 --> 01:54:09,801
<i>Ha-ha, ha-ha."</i>

1444
01:54:43,460 --> 01:54:45,712
<i>- Gotham P.D. has shut down...</i>
- Sweet Jesus.

1445
01:54:45,879 --> 01:54:47,381
<i>...the area's bridges and tunnels.</i>

1446
01:54:47,547 --> 01:54:50,967
Shouldn't you be out there,
you know, doing something?

1447
01:54:51,134 --> 01:54:53,095
It's my day off.

1448
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:55,305
I gotta take a leak.

1449
01:54:55,472 --> 01:54:57,808
Keep an eye out for me, will you?

1450
01:55:03,397 --> 01:55:05,357
Now what?
Need someone to shake it for you?

1451
01:55:05,524 --> 01:55:07,109
Hello.

1452
01:55:07,818 --> 01:55:09,319
Dent.

1453
01:55:09,486 --> 01:55:11,696
Jesus. I thought you was dead.

1454
01:55:11,863 --> 01:55:13,532
Half.

1455
01:55:19,579 --> 01:55:21,164
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

1456
01:55:21,331 --> 01:55:23,333
- It must've been Maroni's men.
- Shut up!

1457
01:55:25,085 --> 01:55:29,131
Are you telling me that you're gonna
protect the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

1458
01:55:29,297 --> 01:55:30,757
I don't know, he never told me.

1459
01:55:30,924 --> 01:55:34,553
Listen, Dent, I swear to God, I didn't know
what they were gonna do to you.

1460
01:55:36,096 --> 01:55:37,264
That's funny...

1461
01:55:39,015 --> 01:55:41,768
...because I don't know
what's gonna happen to you either.

1462
01:55:45,856 --> 01:55:47,816
Beautiful, isn't it?

1463
01:55:48,191 --> 01:55:49,860
Beautiful.

1464
01:55:50,402 --> 01:55:51,528
Unethical.

1465
01:55:52,696 --> 01:55:54,239
Dangerous.

1466
01:55:54,448 --> 01:55:57,951
You've turned every cell phone in Gotham
into a microphone.

1467
01:55:58,118 --> 01:56:00,537
And a high-frequency generator-receiver.

1468
01:56:00,704 --> 01:56:05,792
You took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city.

1469
01:56:05,959 --> 01:56:10,547
With half the city feeding you sonar,
you can image all of Gotham.

1470
01:56:12,466 --> 01:56:13,842
This is wrong.

1471
01:56:14,009 --> 01:56:16,052
I've gotta find this man, Lucius.

1472
01:56:18,054 --> 01:56:19,347
At what cost?

1473
01:56:19,514 --> 01:56:22,309
The database is null-key encrypted.

1474
01:56:22,476 --> 01:56:24,686
It can only be accessed by one person.

1475
01:56:26,021 --> 01:56:28,190
This is too much power for one person.

1476
01:56:28,356 --> 01:56:30,525
That's why I gave it to you.

1477
01:56:30,984 --> 01:56:32,194
Only you can use it.

1478
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:36,156
Spying on 30 million people
isn't part of my job description.

1479
01:56:38,366 --> 01:56:42,078
This is an audio sample. If he talks
within range of any phone in the city...

1480
01:56:42,245 --> 01:56:44,456
...you can triangulate his position.

1481
01:56:44,915 --> 01:56:47,417
I'll help you this one time.

1482
01:56:47,876 --> 01:56:49,669
But consider this my resignation.

1483
01:56:49,836 --> 01:56:54,424
As long as this machine is
at Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.

1484
01:56:55,175 --> 01:56:57,093
When you're finished...

1485
01:56:57,761 --> 01:56:58,887
...type in your name.

1486
01:57:07,479 --> 01:57:10,565
My officers are going over
every inch of the tunnels and bridges...

1487
01:57:10,732 --> 01:57:13,944
...but with the Joker's threat,
they're not an option.

1488
01:57:14,110 --> 01:57:16,947
- And land routes east?
- Backed up for hours.

1489
01:57:17,113 --> 01:57:20,742
Which leaves the ferries
with 30,000 ready to board.

1490
01:57:20,909 --> 01:57:23,954
I wanna use the ferries so I can
get those prisoners off the island.

1491
01:57:24,287 --> 01:57:27,082
The men you put away?
Those aren't people I'm worried about.

1492
01:57:27,249 --> 01:57:29,376
You should be.
Whatever the Joker's planning...

1493
01:57:29,543 --> 01:57:34,047
...it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners are
involved. I wanna get them out of here.

1494
01:57:35,507 --> 01:57:36,716
So where is Harvey?

1495
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:40,470
- We haven't found him.
- Oh, Jesus.

1496
01:57:44,307 --> 01:57:46,393
How long can you keep this quiet?

1497
01:58:00,490 --> 01:58:03,159
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.

1498
01:58:03,994 --> 01:58:06,162
Going to join your wife?

1499
01:58:09,666 --> 01:58:12,168
- You love her?
- Yes.

1500
01:58:13,044 --> 01:58:16,006
You ever imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die?

1501
01:58:16,172 --> 01:58:17,674
Look, take it up with the Joker.

1502
01:58:17,841 --> 01:58:21,094
He killed your woman. He made you...

1503
01:58:21,261 --> 01:58:22,304
...like this.

1504
01:58:22,679 --> 01:58:25,682
The Joker's just a mad dog.

1505
01:58:25,849 --> 01:58:28,476
I want whoever let him off the leash.

1506
01:58:29,185 --> 01:58:32,522
I took care of Wuertz, but who was
your other man inside Gordon's unit?

1507
01:58:32,689 --> 01:58:35,317
Who picked up Rachel?
Must have been someone she trusted.

1508
01:58:36,526 --> 01:58:38,653
Look, if I tell you...

1509
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:39,863
...will you let me go?

1510
01:58:40,614 --> 01:58:41,948
Can't hurt your chances.

1511
01:58:44,701 --> 01:58:46,369
It was Ramirez.

1512
01:58:51,791 --> 01:58:55,045
- But you said--
- I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

1513
01:58:58,632 --> 01:59:00,759
You're a lucky man.

1514
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:05,972
- But he's not.
- Who?

1515
01:59:08,892 --> 01:59:10,310
Your driver.

1516
01:59:23,573 --> 01:59:24,574
Stand back.

1517
01:59:24,741 --> 01:59:27,077
Hey, that ain't right.
We should be on that boat.

1518
01:59:27,243 --> 01:59:29,829
You wanna ride across
with them? Be my guest.

1519
01:59:53,061 --> 01:59:54,771
Sir, they've stopped their engines.

1520
01:59:54,938 --> 01:59:55,939
Right, get on the radio.

1521
01:59:56,106 --> 01:59:59,776
Tell them we'll come back and pick them up
once we dump the scumbags.

1522
01:59:59,943 --> 02:00:02,320
<i>Liberty,</i> this <i>is Spirit.</i> Come <i>in.</i>

1523
02:00:04,364 --> 02:00:05,573
What the heck was that?

1524
02:00:07,492 --> 02:00:08,952
What the--?

1525
02:00:09,494 --> 02:00:12,789
Liberty, come in,
<i>please. This</i> is Spirit. Come in.

1526
02:00:14,374 --> 02:00:16,292
Liberty, <i>we have the same thing.
We've lost both engines.</i>

1527
02:00:16,459 --> 02:00:17,961
- Liberty, come in.
- Fox.

1528
02:00:18,128 --> 02:00:20,630
<i>There's something going on
on the ferries.</i>

1529
02:00:21,381 --> 02:00:23,675
Get down to the engine room now.

1530
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:26,511
Hey, buddy, What's happening?

1531
02:00:35,103 --> 02:00:38,565
Captain, we got a hundred barrels
down there rigged to blow. And this.

1532
02:00:51,661 --> 02:00:52,746
Oh, my God.

1533
02:00:52,912 --> 02:00:54,748
Looks like some kind of detonator.

1534
02:00:54,914 --> 02:00:57,792
Why would they give us
the detonator to our own bomb?

1535
02:01:00,712 --> 02:01:04,007
<i>Tonight, you're all
gonna be a part of a social experiment.</i>

1536
02:01:07,844 --> 02:01:11,681
<i>Through the magic of diesel fuel
and ammonium nitrate...</i>

1537
02:01:11,848 --> 02:01:15,935
<i>...I'm ready right now
to blow you all sky-high.</i>

1538
02:01:16,102 --> 02:01:18,188
<i>Liberty,</i> come <i>in,</i> over.

1539
02:01:19,647 --> 02:01:20,690
It's dead.

1540
02:01:21,024 --> 02:01:25,528
<i>If anyone attempts
to get off their boat, you all die.</i>

1541
02:01:25,862 --> 02:01:27,155
<i>I'm zeroing in.</i>

1542
02:01:27,322 --> 02:01:31,868
<i>Each of you has a remote
to blow up the other boat.</i>

1543
02:01:32,035 --> 02:01:34,496
His voice is on the ferry...

1544
02:01:34,662 --> 02:01:36,706
...but it's not the source.

1545
02:01:38,958 --> 02:01:40,084
West.

1546
02:01:47,342 --> 02:01:49,636
- Gordon.
<i>- I have the Joker's location.</i>

1547
02:01:49,803 --> 02:01:50,887
<i>Prewitt Building.</i>

1548
02:01:51,054 --> 02:01:53,515
<i>Assemble on the building opposite.</i>

1549
02:01:54,891 --> 02:01:57,685
At midnight, I blow you all up.

1550
02:01:57,852 --> 02:02:03,024
<i>If, however, one of you presses the button,
I'll let that boat live.</i>

1551
02:02:03,191 --> 02:02:05,318
<i>So who's it gonna be?</i>

1552
02:02:05,485 --> 02:02:08,029
<i>Harvey Dent's most-wanted
scumbag collection...</i>

1553
02:02:08,196 --> 02:02:11,533
<i>...or the sweet and innocent civilians?</i>

1554
02:02:11,699 --> 02:02:14,244
<i>You choose.</i>

1555
02:02:14,410 --> 02:02:16,329
<i>Oh, and you might wanna
decide quickly...</i>

1556
02:02:16,496 --> 02:02:20,834
<i>...because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.</i>

1557
02:02:28,258 --> 02:02:29,259
Stay back.

1558
02:02:29,425 --> 02:02:33,221
Well, now, who are you to decide?
We ought to talk this over, at least.

1559
02:02:33,596 --> 02:02:37,183
We don't all have to die.
Those men had their chance.

1560
02:02:37,809 --> 02:02:41,604
- We are not going to talk about this.
- Why aren't we talking about it?

1561
02:02:41,771 --> 02:02:44,357
They're talking over the same thing
on the other boat.

1562
02:02:44,524 --> 02:02:46,818
- Let's put it to a vote.
- Yes!

1563
02:02:52,115 --> 02:02:54,701
- Hello?
<i>- Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.</i>

1564
02:02:54,868 --> 02:02:57,912
Jim needs you to pack up
and put the kids in the car right away.

1565
02:02:58,079 --> 02:02:59,789
But the units outside...

1566
02:02:59,956 --> 02:03:01,541
<i>Those cops can't be trusted.</i>

1567
02:03:01,708 --> 02:03:04,669
Jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible.

1568
02:03:04,836 --> 02:03:07,797
I'll call them off for 10 minutes,
and you'll have to move fast.

1569
02:03:07,964 --> 02:03:11,801
<i>-But Where am I supposed to take them?</i>
- 25052nd Street.

1570
02:03:11,968 --> 02:03:14,387
<i>-Leave as soon as the patrol car pulls out.</i>
- Okay.

1571
02:03:15,763 --> 02:03:17,557
She believe you?

1572
02:03:17,765 --> 02:03:19,809
It's because she trusts you...

1573
02:03:20,143 --> 02:03:21,227
...just like Rachel did.

1574
02:03:21,394 --> 02:03:23,479
- I didn't know--
- Didn't know what they'd do?

1575
02:03:23,646 --> 02:03:26,399
You're the second cop to say that to me.

1576
02:03:26,649 --> 02:03:28,776
What exactly did you think
they were gonna do?

1577
02:03:28,943 --> 02:03:31,195
They got me early on.
My mother's hospital bills...

1578
02:03:31,362 --> 02:03:34,407
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

1579
02:03:34,949 --> 02:03:37,410
You live to fight another day, officer.

1580
02:03:41,205 --> 02:03:43,041
We found the missing hospital bus.

1581
02:03:43,207 --> 02:03:44,918
Then we have a hostage situation.

1582
02:03:47,003 --> 02:03:49,005
It's a shooting gallery.

1583
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:51,674
Why would he choose a spot
with such big windows?

1584
02:03:51,841 --> 02:03:53,676
We have clear shots on five clowns.

1585
02:03:53,843 --> 02:03:56,596
<i>Snipers take them out,
smash the windows, a team rappels in.</i>

1586
02:03:57,013 --> 02:03:58,514
<i>Team moves in by the stairwells.</i>

1587
02:03:58,681 --> 02:04:00,808
<i>Two, three casualties max.</i>

1588
02:04:00,975 --> 02:04:02,852
- Let's do it.
- It's not that simple.

1589
02:04:03,019 --> 02:04:05,355
- With the Joker, it never is.
- What's simple is...

1590
02:04:05,521 --> 02:04:08,691
...every second, those people on the ferries
get closer to blowing--

1591
02:04:08,858 --> 02:04:11,402
- That won't happen.
- Then he'll blow both of them up!

1592
02:04:11,569 --> 02:04:15,323
- We don't have time for paper ballots.
- I want everybody to put their votes...

1593
02:04:15,490 --> 02:04:17,492
...on this piece of paper.

1594
02:04:18,534 --> 02:04:21,371
If anyone's got pens, pass it along.

1595
02:04:21,704 --> 02:04:25,500
Thank you. Anybody else?
Coming through. Anybody else? Thank you.

1596
02:04:25,667 --> 02:04:28,544
We need to get these votes in quickly.

1597
02:04:28,711 --> 02:04:30,254
Come on.

1598
02:04:32,256 --> 02:04:34,384
What are you waiting for?
Push the button!

1599
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:36,511
We're running out of time!

1600
02:04:37,804 --> 02:04:39,639
I need five minutes alone.

1601
02:04:39,806 --> 02:04:41,641
No! There's no time!

1602
02:04:41,808 --> 02:04:43,226
We have clear shots!

1603
02:04:43,393 --> 02:04:46,312
Dent is in there with them.
We have to save Dent!

1604
02:04:46,479 --> 02:04:48,439
I have to save Dent.

1605
02:04:48,606 --> 02:04:49,732
Get ready.

1606
02:04:52,568 --> 02:04:55,238
Two minutes, then we breach.

1607
02:05:00,827 --> 02:05:02,328
Fox, I need picture.

1608
02:05:05,373 --> 02:05:07,834
- Hello?
<i>- Jim,</i> we 're in <i>trouble.</i>

1609
02:05:09,085 --> 02:05:11,379
Okay, you got POV on alpha...

1610
02:05:12,422 --> 02:05:14,382
<i>...Omni on beta.</i>

1611
02:05:15,842 --> 02:05:19,220
<i>Looks like clowns and hostages
on two floors.</i>

1612
02:05:19,387 --> 02:05:21,806
<i>There's a SWAT team on the stairwell.</i>

1613
02:05:25,101 --> 02:05:27,729
<i>Another SWAT team on the roof.</i>

1614
02:05:29,272 --> 02:05:30,481
Line's clear.

1615
02:05:32,233 --> 02:05:34,944
- Barbara, calm down.
- He has the <i>kids!</i>

1616
02:05:35,111 --> 02:05:38,364
<i>- Hello, Jim.</i>
- Harvey?

1617
02:05:39,157 --> 02:05:42,368
- Where's <i>my</i> family?
<i>-Where my family died.</i>

1618
02:05:45,455 --> 02:05:47,123
<i>Blue team, acquire the target.</i>

1619
02:05:48,791 --> 02:05:51,377
<i>Entry team, set your charge.</i>

1620
02:06:07,310 --> 02:06:10,813
<i>Fox, the SWATs are targeting the
wrong people. The clowns are the hostages.</i>

1621
02:06:11,522 --> 02:06:13,316
Red team, go! Red team, go!

1622
02:06:17,070 --> 02:06:18,488
<i>Entry team, blow and go!</i>

1623
02:06:22,575 --> 02:06:23,993
Don't move.

1624
02:06:25,161 --> 02:06:26,537
<i>Take the shot.</i>

1625
02:06:32,168 --> 02:06:33,836
<i>Those SWATs are coming in hot.</i>

1626
02:06:34,003 --> 02:06:35,838
Clowns, put down your guns.

1627
02:06:36,339 --> 02:06:38,966
- Drop your weapons!
- On the ground, now!

1628
02:06:39,175 --> 02:06:42,345
Doctors, get down!
Clear the line of fire. Drop your weap--

1629
02:07:06,953 --> 02:07:08,121
Freeze!

1630
02:07:08,287 --> 02:07:10,665
Stand down or you will be--

1631
02:07:14,210 --> 02:07:15,670
<i>Look up.</i>

1632
02:07:16,254 --> 02:07:18,840
<i>See those bad guys on the floor above?</i>

1633
02:07:19,006 --> 02:07:22,009
<i>They're waiting to ambush the SWAT team
coming up the elevator.</i>

1634
02:07:22,468 --> 02:07:23,511
<i>Sixty seconds.</i>

1635
02:07:31,811 --> 02:07:36,399
The tally is 140 against, 396 for.

1636
02:07:44,532 --> 02:07:47,076
So go ahead. Do it.

1637
02:07:47,243 --> 02:07:49,245
We're still here.

1638
02:07:50,413 --> 02:07:53,374
And that means they haven't
killed us yet either.

1639
02:07:54,834 --> 02:07:56,586
Go, go, go!

1640
02:07:56,752 --> 02:07:58,546
Blue team, cover!

1641
02:08:01,507 --> 02:08:02,550
Uh-oh.

1642
02:08:04,051 --> 02:08:05,720
<i>Trouble on the floor above.</i>

1643
02:08:15,062 --> 02:08:16,439
Get down on the ground now!

1644
02:08:24,864 --> 02:08:27,283
Freeze! Stop or we will shoot.

1645
02:08:27,450 --> 02:08:29,452
We will shoot you. Drop the officer.

1646
02:08:29,619 --> 02:08:33,289
- Release the officer right now.
- Let him go now! On your knees!

1647
02:08:33,873 --> 02:08:35,958
We got him. He's out of the game.

1648
02:08:36,125 --> 02:08:38,628
- Keep your hands in the air!
- Step away from the edge!

1649
02:08:46,677 --> 02:08:48,304
Halt!

1650
02:09:01,609 --> 02:09:02,985
- Stay down!
- Don't move!

1651
02:09:03,152 --> 02:09:07,448
<i>Be advised.
Clowns are hostages, doctors are targets.</i>

1652
02:09:13,746 --> 02:09:15,915
Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled.

1653
02:09:16,082 --> 02:09:19,252
- Where's the detonator'?
- Go get him.

1654
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:35,726
- Put down your weapon!
- Don't move!

1655
02:10:07,133 --> 02:10:09,010
You don't wanna die...

1656
02:10:09,176 --> 02:10:12,221
...but you don't know how to take a life.

1657
02:10:12,388 --> 02:10:14,056
Give it to me.

1658
02:10:14,348 --> 02:10:18,686
These men will kill you
and take it anyway.

1659
02:10:22,106 --> 02:10:24,608
No one wants to get their hands dirty.

1660
02:10:24,775 --> 02:10:27,737
Fine. I'll do it.

1661
02:10:29,405 --> 02:10:32,116
Those men on that boat?
They made their choices.

1662
02:10:32,283 --> 02:10:34,577
They chose to murder and steal.

1663
02:10:34,744 --> 02:10:37,955
It doesn't make any sense
for us to have to die too.

1664
02:10:47,423 --> 02:10:49,884
All the old familiar places.

1665
02:10:56,182 --> 02:10:57,266
Stand by.

1666
02:11:07,610 --> 02:11:11,197
Red team, floor secure.
Hostages are safe.

1667
02:11:11,405 --> 02:11:13,491
Give it to me.

1668
02:11:14,909 --> 02:11:18,662
You can tell them I took it by force.

1669
02:11:19,163 --> 02:11:24,085
Give it to me, and I'll do what
you should've did 10 minutes ago.

1670
02:11:46,148 --> 02:11:49,485
We really should stop this fighting,
otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.

1671
02:11:49,652 --> 02:11:51,487
There won't be any fireworks.

1672
02:11:51,904 --> 02:11:55,116
And here we go.

1673
02:12:34,447 --> 02:12:36,365
What were you trying to prove?

1674
02:12:36,532 --> 02:12:39,493
That deep down,
everyone's as ugly as you?

1675
02:12:40,619 --> 02:12:41,662
You're alone.

1676
02:12:48,252 --> 02:12:53,757
Can't rely on anyone these days.
You gotta do everything yourself. Don't we?

1677
02:12:53,966 --> 02:12:56,802
That's okay. I came prepared.

1678
02:12:57,011 --> 02:13:01,474
It's a funny world we live in. Speaking of
which, you know how I got these scars?

1679
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:04,477
No, but I know how you got these.

1680
02:13:22,286 --> 02:13:25,039
Oh, you.

1681
02:13:25,206 --> 02:13:28,250
You just couldn't let me go, could you?

1682
02:13:29,376 --> 02:13:33,297
This is what happens
when an unstoppable force...

1683
02:13:33,464 --> 02:13:37,927
...meets an immovable object.

1684
02:13:38,511 --> 02:13:43,933
You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?

1685
02:13:44,099 --> 02:13:46,810
Huh? You won't kill me...

1686
02:13:46,977 --> 02:13:53,234
...out of some misplaced sense
of self-righteousness.

1687
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:56,612
And I won't kill you...

1688
02:13:56,779 --> 02:14:00,574
...because you're just too much fun.

1689
02:14:01,617 --> 02:14:05,788
I think you and I are destined
to do this forever.

1690
02:14:05,955 --> 02:14:07,957
You'll be in a padded cell forever.

1691
02:14:08,123 --> 02:14:09,959
Maybe we could share one.

1692
02:14:10,125 --> 02:14:14,296
You know, they'll be doubling up, the rate
this city's inhabitants are losing their minds.

1693
02:14:14,463 --> 02:14:17,591
This city just showed you...

1694
02:14:17,758 --> 02:14:21,804
...that it's full of people
ready to believe in good.

1695
02:14:21,971 --> 02:14:25,140
Until their spirit breaks completely.

1696
02:14:26,016 --> 02:14:30,854
Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent...

1697
02:14:31,021 --> 02:14:33,816
...and all the heroic things he's done.

1698
02:14:35,484 --> 02:14:40,531
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle
for Gotham's soul...

1699
02:14:40,698 --> 02:14:43,617
...in a fistfight with you?

1700
02:14:44,159 --> 02:14:45,703
No.

1701
02:14:45,869 --> 02:14:49,290
You need an ace in the hole.

1702
02:14:49,456 --> 02:14:51,083
Mine's Harvey.

1703
02:14:51,458 --> 02:14:53,168
What did you do?

1704
02:14:53,335 --> 02:14:56,338
I took Gotham's white knight...

1705
02:14:56,505 --> 02:15:00,134
...and I brought him down to our level.

1706
02:15:00,551 --> 02:15:03,512
It wasn't hard.
See, madness, as you know...

1707
02:15:03,679 --> 02:15:06,724
...is like gravity.

1708
02:15:06,890 --> 02:15:09,226
All it takes is a little push.

1709
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:27,911
Dent!

1710
02:15:48,891 --> 02:15:53,228
This is where they brought her,
Gordon, after your men handed her over.

1711
02:15:53,979 --> 02:15:55,564
This is where she died.

1712
02:15:55,731 --> 02:15:58,067
I know, I was here...

1713
02:15:59,109 --> 02:16:01,862
- ...trying to save her.
- But you didn't.

1714
02:16:02,154 --> 02:16:05,574
- I couldn't.
- Yes, you could've. If you'd listened to me.

1715
02:16:05,741 --> 02:16:08,369
If you stood up against corruption...

1716
02:16:08,535 --> 02:16:10,746
...instead of doing your deal
with the devil.

1717
02:16:10,913 --> 02:16:12,539
I was trying to fight the Mob!

1718
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:17,878
You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself
if you knew what I'd lost.

1719
02:16:19,171 --> 02:16:22,299
Have you ever had to talk to the person
you loved most...

1720
02:16:22,466 --> 02:16:26,345
...tell them it's gonna be all right,
when you know it's not?

1721
02:16:28,013 --> 02:16:31,892
Well, you're about to know
what that feels like, Gordon.

1722
02:16:32,643 --> 02:16:36,522
Then you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.

1723
02:16:38,273 --> 02:16:41,860
- You're not going to hurt my family.
- No.

1724
02:16:42,027 --> 02:16:44,738
Just the person you love most.

1725
02:16:52,746 --> 02:16:55,791
So is it your wife?

1726
02:16:56,875 --> 02:16:58,544
Put the gun down, Harvey.

1727
02:16:58,919 --> 02:17:00,587
Harvey, put down the gun.

1728
02:17:00,754 --> 02:17:04,299
Please. Please, Harvey. Please.

1729
02:17:05,676 --> 02:17:06,969
Oh, goddamn it.

1730
02:17:07,136 --> 02:17:09,304
Will you stop pointing that gun
at my family?

1731
02:17:09,805 --> 02:17:11,473
- No!
- We have a winner.

1732
02:17:11,640 --> 02:17:13,142
No, Jim, stop him!

1733
02:17:13,642 --> 02:17:15,477
- Harvey.
- Don't let him--

1734
02:17:15,644 --> 02:17:16,770
Harvey!

1735
02:17:18,147 --> 02:17:20,023
I'm sorry!

1736
02:17:21,817 --> 02:17:22,901
For everything.

1737
02:17:25,487 --> 02:17:27,698
Please don't hurt my son.

1738
02:17:37,833 --> 02:17:39,418
You brought your cops?

1739
02:17:39,585 --> 02:17:42,463
All they know is there's a situation.

1740
02:17:42,629 --> 02:17:45,632
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.

1741
02:17:45,799 --> 02:17:48,469
You think I wanna escape from this?

1742
02:17:48,635 --> 02:17:51,388
There is no escape from this.

1743
02:17:51,555 --> 02:17:53,682
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.

1744
02:17:55,976 --> 02:17:59,188
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!

1745
02:17:59,938 --> 02:18:04,151
You thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time.

1746
02:18:06,945 --> 02:18:08,030
But you were wrong.

1747
02:18:08,739 --> 02:18:12,534
The world is cruel. And the only morality
in a cruel world...

1748
02:18:13,285 --> 02:18:15,204
...is chance.

1749
02:18:15,370 --> 02:18:17,080
Unbiased.

1750
02:18:17,289 --> 02:18:18,540
Unprejudiced.

1751
02:18:19,917 --> 02:18:21,043
Fair.

1752
02:18:21,210 --> 02:18:23,462
His son's got the same chance she had.

1753
02:18:24,213 --> 02:18:25,506
Fifty-fifty.

1754
02:18:25,672 --> 02:18:29,134
What happened to Rachel wasn't chance.
We decided to act.

1755
02:18:29,468 --> 02:18:30,803
We three.

1756
02:18:30,969 --> 02:18:34,389
Then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything?

1757
02:18:36,892 --> 02:18:39,520
- It wasn't.
- The Joker chose me.

1758
02:18:39,686 --> 02:18:41,980
Because you were the best of us.

1759
02:18:42,147 --> 02:18:47,152
He wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you...

1760
02:18:47,319 --> 02:18:49,071
...could fall.

1761
02:18:49,404 --> 02:18:50,697
And he was right.

1762
02:18:50,864 --> 02:18:53,116
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.

1763
02:18:53,283 --> 02:18:56,328
80 point it at the people responsible.

1764
02:18:57,287 --> 02:18:59,122
Fair enough.

1765
02:19:02,459 --> 02:19:04,336
You first.

1766
02:19:16,849 --> 02:19:18,517
My turn.

1767
02:19:25,440 --> 02:19:27,442
Harvey, you're right.

1768
02:19:28,485 --> 02:19:31,113
Rachel's death was my fault.

1769
02:19:34,199 --> 02:19:36,660
Please don't punish the boy.

1770
02:19:37,744 --> 02:19:40,956
- Please, punish me.
- I'm about to.

1771
02:19:42,916 --> 02:19:44,877
Tell your boy
he's gonna be all right, Gordon.

1772
02:19:45,335 --> 02:19:46,962
Lie...

1773
02:19:47,462 --> 02:19:48,589
...like I lied.

1774
02:19:52,342 --> 02:19:53,927
It's going to be all right, son.

1775
02:20:32,341 --> 02:20:35,177
Dad? Daddy, is he okay?

1776
02:20:51,693 --> 02:20:53,862
- Thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.

1777
02:20:54,488 --> 02:20:56,281
Yes, I do.

1778
02:21:00,535 --> 02:21:01,870
The Joker won.

1779
02:21:04,289 --> 02:21:07,167
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

1780
02:21:07,709 --> 02:21:09,461
- --undone-.

1781
02:21:09,962 --> 02:21:14,883
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

1782
02:21:15,050 --> 02:21:16,218
We bet it all on him.

1783
02:21:17,552 --> 02:21:20,430
The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down.

1784
02:21:21,014 --> 02:21:22,432
People will lose hope.

1785
02:21:22,599 --> 02:21:24,351
They won't.

1786
02:21:26,853 --> 02:21:28,730
They must never know what he did.

1787
02:21:28,897 --> 02:21:30,732
Five dead.

1788
02:21:31,024 --> 02:21:34,945
- Two of them cops. You can't sweep that--
- No.

1789
02:21:39,741 --> 02:21:42,577
But the Joker cannot win.

1790
02:21:47,833 --> 02:21:51,044
Gotham needs its true hero.

1791
02:21:57,426 --> 02:22:00,470
- No.
- You either die a hero...

1792
02:22:00,637 --> 02:22:05,100
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

1793
02:22:05,267 --> 02:22:07,102
I can do those things...

1794
02:22:07,519 --> 02:22:10,564
...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.

1795
02:22:13,567 --> 02:22:16,445
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

1796
02:22:16,611 --> 02:22:18,530
No, no, you can't. You're not.

1797
02:22:18,697 --> 02:22:21,283
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

1798
02:22:22,951 --> 02:22:24,077
Call it in.

1799
02:22:27,372 --> 02:22:29,124
Ahem.

1800
02:22:29,291 --> 02:22:32,544
Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

1801
02:22:33,128 --> 02:22:35,672
Nothing less than a knight...

1802
02:22:36,214 --> 02:22:37,924
...shining.

1803
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:40,177
<i>GORDON“.
They'll hunt you.</i>

1804
02:22:40,343 --> 02:22:42,137
<i>You'll hunt me.</i>

1805
02:22:42,637 --> 02:22:44,598
<i>You'll condemn me.</i>

1806
02:22:45,307 --> 02:22:47,601
<i>Set the dogs on me.</i>

1807
02:22:51,354 --> 02:22:53,648
<i>Because that's what needs to happen.</i>

1808
02:22:54,816 --> 02:22:56,735
<i>Because sometimes...</i>

1809
02:22:56,902 --> 02:22:59,071
<i>...the truth isn't good enough.</i>

1810
02:22:59,946 --> 02:23:02,240
<i>Sometimes people deserve more.</i>

1811
02:23:05,702 --> 02:23:09,623
<i>Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded.</i>

1812
02:23:28,016 --> 02:23:29,684
Batman.

1813
02:23:31,603 --> 02:23:33,355
Batman!

1814
02:23:34,147 --> 02:23:36,108
Why's he running, Dad?

1815
02:23:37,150 --> 02:23:38,485
Because we have to chase him.

1816
02:23:38,652 --> 02:23:41,530
Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!

1817
02:23:47,619 --> 02:23:49,204
He didn't do anything wrong.

1818
02:23:51,957 --> 02:23:57,546
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

1819
02:23:58,964 --> 02:24:00,006
<i>So we'll hunt him...</i>

1820
02:24:03,135 --> 02:24:05,220
<i>...because he can take it.</i>

1821
02:24:07,722 --> 02:24:10,225
<i>Because he's not a hero.</i>

1822
02:24:17,774 --> 02:24:18,984
<i>He's a silent guardian...</i>

1823
02:24:20,152 --> 02:24:22,028
...a watchful protector.

1824
02:24:24,531 --> 02:24:25,824
