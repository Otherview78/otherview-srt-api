1
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:53,990
Imperial Diary.

2
00:00:54,014 --> 00:00:57,226
Year 10, 191, third comment.

3
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:03,732
The battle for Arrakis took everyone by surprise.

4
00:01:04,942 --> 00:01:05,984
There were no witnesses.

5
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:11,114
The Harkonnen operation was perpetrated overnight

6
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:12,658
without warning

7
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:14,743
or declaration of war.

8
00:01:17,162 --> 00:01:19,623
By morning, the Atreides were no more.

9
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,960
All died in the dark.

10
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:33,136
And the Emperor said...

11
00:01:36,473 --> 00:01:37,474
nothing.

12
00:01:40,102 --> 00:01:42,479
Since that night, my father has not been the same,

13
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:44,898
nor have I.

14
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,944
His inaction is difficult for me to accept,

15
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,782
for, I know he loved Duke Leto Atreides like a son.

16
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:01,206
But my father's always been guided

17
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,166
by the calculus of power.

18
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:06,813
This would not be the first time

19
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:08,547
the Harkonnens have done his dirty work.

20
00:02:17,097 --> 00:02:19,599
In the shadows of Arrakis lie many secrets...

21
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:24,396
but the darkest of them all may remain.

22
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:27,899
The end of House Atreides.

23
00:02:43,707 --> 00:02:44,708
Sister,

24
00:02:46,043 --> 00:02:47,169
Father is dead.

25
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,464
Shouldn't you go back to the stars?

26
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:52,424
Be with him?

27
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:56,245
I'm afraid I won't have enough time

28
00:02:56,303 --> 00:02:58,096
to fix things before your coming.

29
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,685
This world is beyond cruelty.

30
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:10,752
Stay here.

31
00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:53,767
Whoa.

32
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:55,310
Whoa!

33
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,498
Never stand with your back

34
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:03,628
towards the open.

35
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:05,552
How many times do I have to tell you that, huh?

36
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:08,091
- You okay? - Yeah.

37
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:10,510
How 'bout her?

38
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:13,179
She's fine.

39
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:22,981
They do not usually venture this deep.

40
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:26,067
They want to make sure no Atreides escaped.

41
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:28,361
You think too much of yourself.

42
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:31,156
No, no, we are in the deep desert.

43
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:33,992
Only Fremen can survive here.

44
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,579
They were here for us, not for you.

45
00:09:38,288 --> 00:09:39,497
Don't worry.

46
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:42,625
I'm taking you somewhere they will never find us.

47
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:00,977
Filthy water.

48
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:03,521
It's full of chemicals

49
00:10:03,605 --> 00:10:06,024
but good enough for cooling systems.

50
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:11,070
Don't let it out.

51
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:15,450
- You okay? - Mm-hmm.

52
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,577
Don't let that out.

53
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,703
Don't let it out. No.

54
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm okay.

55
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,585
- Are you sure? - Mm-hmm.

56
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:30,715
You fought well...

57
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:33,593
once you woke up.

58
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:36,846
I wasn't sleeping.

59
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:09,337
No, no, no. I'll do it.

60
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:14,736
Lord... Lord Rabban.

61
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:17,631
Now that the spice fields have been secured,

62
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:19,032
I strongly recommend

63
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:21,409
bringing all troops out of Fremen territories.

64
00:12:21,743 --> 00:12:23,303
We're losing too many men to the desert.

65
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:24,412
Rats.

66
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,331
I beg your pardon?

67
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:29,292
We're losing men to rats.

68
00:12:32,337 --> 00:12:34,589
Fremen. I can't confirm, my Lord.

69
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:36,392
Communications are hectic in the open sands.

70
00:12:36,466 --> 00:12:39,344
Your orders were to control the whole planet.

71
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:41,888
We are.

72
00:12:42,055 --> 00:12:43,681
I see only half of it.

73
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:45,433
As you may recall,

74
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:48,937
the South is uninhabitable, my Lord.

75
00:12:51,314 --> 00:12:52,732
May I suggest you get some rest?

76
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:56,611
Rats! Hairy rats! Kill them!

77
00:12:56,694 --> 00:12:59,822
Kill them all! Kill them all!

78
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:01,199
Rats!

79
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:50,123
He's asking why we're so late.

80
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,334
- ...Harkonnen. - No, no.

81
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:56,796
He thinks you're spies.

82
00:13:58,881 --> 00:13:59,942
He said...

83
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:00,967
I got that.

84
00:14:01,801 --> 00:14:02,802
Thanks.

85
00:14:02,969 --> 00:14:04,345
Stay close to me.

86
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:06,180
Hmm?

87
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:27,118
Sietch Tabr.

88
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:03,542
Look how your Bene Gesserit propaganda

89
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:04,567
has taken root.

90
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:09,447
Some of them already think I'm their messiah.

91
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:12,116
Others...

92
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:15,661
false prophet.

93
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:18,539
I must sway the non-believers.

94
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:20,458
If they follow me,

95
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,501
we can disrupt spice production.

96
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:25,338
That's the only way I can get to the Emperor.

97
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:27,924
Your father didn't believe in revenge.

98
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:29,926
Yeah, well, I do.

99
00:18:03,501 --> 00:18:04,781
What is happening?

100
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:11,968
Whoa.

101
00:18:13,511 --> 00:18:14,637
What is it?

102
00:18:14,804 --> 00:18:16,472
There is spice in the food.

103
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:28,943
Woman,

104
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:31,404
come with me.

105
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:43,457
...Jamis.

106
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:46,502
...Jamis.

107
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:49,505
...Jamis.

108
00:19:04,437 --> 00:19:05,438
...Jamis.

109
00:19:06,856 --> 00:19:07,982
...Jamis.

110
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:11,110
...Jamis.

111
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,822
...Jamis.

112
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,245
...Jamis.

113
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:28,085
...Jamis.

114
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:44,143
38,000,000 decaliters.

115
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,687
None of us, even...

116
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:48,856
dying of thirst,

117
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:51,525
would ever drink this water. This is...

118
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:54,653
sacred.

119
00:19:58,783 --> 00:20:00,159
Jamis' water.

120
00:20:01,452 --> 00:20:02,870
We have a...

121
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:04,955
thousand such places.

122
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:07,917
When we have enough water,

123
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,212
the Lisan al-Gaib

124
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:13,672
will change the face of Arrakis.

125
00:20:13,756 --> 00:20:16,467
He will bring back the trees. He will bring back...

126
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:19,637
the Green Paradise.

127
00:20:22,598 --> 00:20:24,475
So many souls.

128
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:31,315
Hmm.

129
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:38,531
Never give your water away, not even for the dead. Hmm?

130
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:42,535
Why are you showing me this?

131
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:44,578
Because you are Bene Gesserit.

132
00:20:44,662 --> 00:20:46,789
Because you understand the prophecies.

133
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:50,209
The mother of the Lisan al-Gaib

134
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,710
will be a Reverend Mother.

135
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,714
Our Reverend Mother is dying.

136
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,927
You want me to take her place?

137
00:21:00,094 --> 00:21:01,095
Yes,

138
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:02,972
I do.

139
00:21:05,266 --> 00:21:06,600
You believe in Paul?

140
00:21:09,478 --> 00:21:12,731
There are signs, yes.

141
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:16,735
What if I would refuse?

142
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,613
Mm. Then, he's not Lisan al-Gaib

143
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:22,366
and you have no purpose to serve.

144
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:23,993
What else is left to do then

145
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:26,454
but to return your water to the well?

146
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:27,955
Huh?

147
00:21:31,459 --> 00:21:33,419
It's an honor, isn't it?

148
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:35,702
I think you should feel honored.

149
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:37,882
Well, it was a choice between this or death,

150
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,009
so, you know, forgive me if I'm not flattered.

151
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,804
How does one become a Reverend Mother?

152
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:45,818
It's different from one culture to another.

153
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,641
Here on Arrakis, I have no idea.

154
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:52,813
You're afraid.

155
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,334
Reverend Mothers are tasked with holding the memories

156
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,044
of all the Reverend Mothers that came before them,

157
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:01,238
so I'll be given centuries of pain and sorrow.

158
00:22:02,031 --> 00:22:03,032
Is it dangerous?

159
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:05,534
It's lethal for men.

160
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:07,286
That's for sure.

161
00:23:16,397 --> 00:23:17,773
What are you guys laughing about?

162
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:19,400
Don't bother.

163
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:25,813
You don't believe in all this?

164
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:27,366
No, we don't.

165
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,094
These are old Southern beliefs.

166
00:23:29,118 --> 00:23:30,119
Southern beliefs?

167
00:23:30,995 --> 00:23:32,788
Southern tribes believe a messiah will come

168
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:34,123
to deliver us from evil.

169
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:36,834
You don't believe in the Lisan al-Gaib?

170
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:38,961
We believe in Fremen.

171
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:40,564
- Bi-lal kaifa. - Bi-lal kaifa.

172
00:23:41,714 --> 00:23:43,299
You want to control people,

173
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:45,342
you tell them a messiah will come.

174
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,845
Then they'll wait for centuries.

175
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:54,643
Now, we must pray.

176
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:03,152
What about him?

177
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:04,315
- Stilgar? - Mm-hmm.

178
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:05,654
He's from the South.

179
00:24:06,405 --> 00:24:07,698
You didn't notice his accent?

180
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:18,375
What'll happen to my mother?

181
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:42,419
I must not fear.

182
00:24:42,483 --> 00:24:43,567
Fear is the mind-killer.

183
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:45,319
Fear, the little death

184
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:46,695
that brings total obliteration.

185
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:48,781
I will face my fear. I will...

186
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,439
- What is it? - Drink!

187
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:29,584
She's right.

188
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:31,944
She's right!

189
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:33,487
It's no miracle.

190
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:36,406
My mother was trained to do that.

191
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:39,243
Poison transmutation is something

192
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:40,869
advanced Bene Gesserit can do.

193
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:45,624
I'm not the Mahdi.

194
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:50,963
I'm not here to lead.

195
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,198
Let me fight beside you.

196
00:27:58,887 --> 00:27:59,888
That's all I'm asking.

197
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:24,765
How are you?

198
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:26,248
Better.

199
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:28,834
How is she?

200
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,920
She was frightened but she's...

201
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:34,047
she's okay.

202
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:41,138
Paul...

203
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:46,351
she talks to me.

204
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,231
She believes in you.

205
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,611
She says...

206
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:05,037
You're so close now.

207
00:29:05,203 --> 00:29:06,997
Only one step remains

208
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,499
and you will become the Kwisatz Haderach.

209
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:12,294
Only one step remains.

210
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,755
You must do what I did.

211
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:16,882
You must drink the Water of Life.

212
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:19,843
Free your mind, it's gonna...

213
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,137
it's gonna open and you will see.

214
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,070
If you wanna fight with us,

215
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:37,152
first thing, you must learn

216
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:40,781
to be one with the desert.

217
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,116
So, here is a tent

218
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:44,868
and enough food.

219
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,870
I want you to cross

220
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:49,706
that small erg and come back.

221
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,042
Travel by night.

222
00:29:52,209 --> 00:29:53,794
You know how to use a paracompass?

223
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:55,253
- Yes. - Oh.

224
00:29:57,923 --> 00:29:59,025
Anything else I should know?

225
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:01,843
Uh, beside the worms and the Harkonnens,

226
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:04,471
beware of the trapdoor spiders.

227
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:07,683
Centipedes are very nasty.

228
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:09,017
Not the big ones.

229
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:10,769
They are harmless.

230
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:12,562
But the little ones

231
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,523
you have to worry about, and... Oh!

232
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:18,568
Don't ever,

233
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:21,154
ever listen to the jinn.

234
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:24,574
- The jinn? - Jinn.

235
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:26,368
Desert spirits.

236
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:29,913
They whisper at night.

237
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:37,295
They, they can possess you.

238
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:39,840
Really, be careful.

239
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:41,341
They are demons.

240
00:30:44,636 --> 00:30:46,430
But it's true. Don't listen to them.

241
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:48,890
Huh?

242
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:13,767
Jamis.

243
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:16,871
You sandwalk

244
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:17,979
like a drunk lizard.

245
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:22,818
Yeah, I'm doing pretty good so far.

246
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:25,362
Yeah, well, you're not even in worm territory yet.

247
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:45,882
You have to break up your rhythm.

248
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:51,471
Like this.

249
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:53,616
Now, that's interesting

250
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,267
because in the filmbooks I've studied,

251
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:57,686
the anthropologists say, in order to properly sandwalk,

252
00:32:57,853 --> 00:32:58,854
you actually have to...

253
00:33:02,107 --> 00:33:03,108
Never mind.

254
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,610
Please keep going.

255
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:34,490
You know, I'm the only one who believes

256
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:35,834
you're gonna make it until summer.

257
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,520
Everyone else thinks you won't make it two weeks.

258
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,330
If you wanna follow us in the desert,

259
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:42,754
you need to know how windtraps work.

260
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:44,232
So listen to me.

261
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,651
They're simple, but they require constant attention.

262
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:47,903
Uh...

263
00:33:47,986 --> 00:33:50,155
This right here, it captures the moisture

264
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:51,907
and then it carries it into that pocket.

265
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:54,910
Uh, and...

266
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:56,036
These are the filters

267
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,719
that need to be changed every three days.

268
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:00,749
What?

269
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:06,838
Stop looking at me like that.

270
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:13,946
He's training with the Fremen.

271
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,014
He will be back soon. Don't worry.

272
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:18,183
Mm-hmm.

273
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:20,435
You're right.

274
00:34:20,518 --> 00:34:22,395
If we want to protect your brother,

275
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:25,774
we need all the Fremen to believe in the prophecy.

276
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:35,033
We must convert the non-believers one by one.

277
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,496
We need to start with the weaker ones.

278
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:42,290
The vulnerable ones.

279
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:47,295
The ones who fear us.

280
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,987
Hey, get out of here. Go.

281
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:56,383
- You okay? - Yeah.

282
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:35,255
Let's go! Move!

283
00:37:52,397 --> 00:37:53,398
Load!

284
00:38:14,043 --> 00:38:15,336
Chani!

285
00:38:20,258 --> 00:38:21,593
Reload!

286
00:38:35,982 --> 00:38:37,484
Reload!

287
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:40,195
Watch out!

288
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:57,420
Its shield will only open when it fires.

289
00:38:57,504 --> 00:38:59,607
I know that. What do you think I'm trying to do?

290
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:02,717
I'll trigger it. On my signal. Be ready.

291
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:26,282
Go!

292
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,286
Oh, shit!

293
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:33,414
Go, go!

294
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,346
Mm.

295
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:42,001
Who taught you to fight like that?

296
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:43,693
- My old masters. - Hmm.

297
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,111
And they were close friends.

298
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:49,324
They were massacred.

299
00:40:50,074 --> 00:40:51,367
Alongside my father.

300
00:40:56,831 --> 00:40:58,916
You've been fighting the Harkonnens for decades.

301
00:41:00,126 --> 00:41:02,420
My family's been fighting them for centuries.

302
00:41:02,587 --> 00:41:05,131
I know everything about them. Their habits,

303
00:41:05,298 --> 00:41:06,799
their ways of thinking.

304
00:41:07,592 --> 00:41:09,032
You know everything about the desert.

305
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:10,678
You harness the very power of it.

306
00:41:12,597 --> 00:41:14,265
We can stop them together.

307
00:41:14,432 --> 00:41:16,893
Bury them in the sand where they belong.

308
00:41:17,435 --> 00:41:19,937
So that this planet can be yours once more.

309
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,691
What will you have us do? Huh?

310
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:26,277
- What would you do, Stilgar? - I? I would...

311
00:41:27,904 --> 00:41:29,656
...would strike even further north.

312
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:31,324
Then I will go further north.

313
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:34,410
And the further north you go, the more likely it is you die.

314
00:41:58,267 --> 00:42:01,437
I see strength in you.

315
00:42:06,901 --> 00:42:08,444
Come. Come.

316
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:19,414
You

317
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:22,375
shall be known among us

318
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:23,918
as Usul.

319
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:25,128
Usul.

320
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:26,379
- Usul. - Usul.

321
00:42:26,462 --> 00:42:29,674
And now, a Fedaykin is a fighter

322
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:31,217
and needs a war name.

323
00:42:31,843 --> 00:42:32,844
You must choose.

324
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:39,767
How do you call the, uh...

325
00:42:41,102 --> 00:42:42,645
the small desert mouse, again?

326
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:45,940
- Muad'Dib. - Muad'Dib.

327
00:42:46,023 --> 00:42:48,568
No, no, no. Shh.

328
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:52,572
Muad'Dib is wise in the ways of the desert.

329
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:53,740
Muad'Dib...

330
00:42:55,283 --> 00:42:57,326
creates his own water.

331
00:42:57,493 --> 00:42:59,620
The constellation that points to the North Star

332
00:42:59,704 --> 00:43:01,080
we call Muad'Dib.

333
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,249
"The One Who Points the Way."

334
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:06,169
That is a powerful name.

335
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:15,052
Now you are our brother. Hmm.

336
00:43:15,136 --> 00:43:19,056
Paul Muad'Dib Usul.

337
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:28,357
Muad'Dib Usul.

338
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:31,152
Paul Muad'Dib Usul.

339
00:43:33,613 --> 00:43:34,822
Muad'Dib Usul.

340
00:43:36,616 --> 00:43:37,700
Muad'Dib.

341
00:43:40,912 --> 00:43:42,112
- Usul. - Muad'Dib.

342
00:43:42,163 --> 00:43:43,164
Muad'Dib.

343
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:00,640
Hey!

344
00:44:00,807 --> 00:44:02,308
Stilgar!

345
00:44:17,156 --> 00:44:18,783
Father, I found my way.

346
00:44:35,925 --> 00:44:36,926
It's breathtaking.

347
00:44:45,977 --> 00:44:46,978
Hmm.

348
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,524
Look. Right there. Spice.

349
00:44:52,817 --> 00:44:56,279
Arrakis is so beautiful when the sun is low.

350
00:45:03,202 --> 00:45:04,203
Where you're from,

351
00:45:05,538 --> 00:45:07,748
does water really fall from the sky?

352
00:45:07,874 --> 00:45:09,166
Oh, yes.

353
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:11,210
Sometimes it rains for weeks

354
00:45:11,294 --> 00:45:12,461
on Caladan.

355
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,673
Where you see sand here, imagine water.

356
00:45:18,843 --> 00:45:21,679
Our castle stands on cliffs high above the sea.

357
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:24,807
If you dive in, you can't reach the bottom.

358
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:27,768
- You dive in? - Yes,

359
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,936
it's called swimming.

360
00:45:29,937 --> 00:45:32,607
I don't... I don't believe you, Usul.

361
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:33,774
Usul.

362
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:37,528
What's your secret name?

363
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:41,699
Sihaya.

364
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:43,117
- Sihaya. - Mm.

365
00:45:44,785 --> 00:45:46,287
What does that mean?

366
00:45:46,454 --> 00:45:47,997
Means "Desert Spring."

367
00:45:48,164 --> 00:45:49,373
"Desert Spring."

368
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:52,752
- I love it. - I hate it.

369
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:55,463
It's from some stupid prophecy.

370
00:45:56,839 --> 00:45:57,840
I prefer Chani.

371
00:45:58,925 --> 00:46:00,384
I prefer Chani too then.

372
00:46:07,475 --> 00:46:08,875
Do you think Stilgar would teach me?

373
00:46:09,393 --> 00:46:10,811
- To ride? - Yeah.

374
00:46:11,228 --> 00:46:14,357
No. Only Fremen ride worms.

375
00:46:14,523 --> 00:46:16,123
Well, I thought I'd become one, didn't I?

376
00:46:16,192 --> 00:46:18,027
By name, not by blood.

377
00:46:20,446 --> 00:46:25,034
Your blood comes from Dukes and Great Houses.

378
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,287
We don't have that here.

379
00:46:29,413 --> 00:46:30,414
Here,

380
00:46:31,123 --> 00:46:33,501
we're equal, men and women alike.

381
00:46:33,668 --> 00:46:35,670
What we do, we do for the benefit of all.

382
00:46:35,836 --> 00:46:37,838
Well, I'd very much like to be equal to you.

383
00:46:44,261 --> 00:46:47,640
Paul Muad'Dib Usul,

384
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:51,644
maybe you could be Fremen.

385
00:46:54,939 --> 00:46:56,315
Maybe I'll show you the way.

386
00:48:25,071 --> 00:48:26,072
Rabban.

387
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:40,795
Fremen attacks on your watch.

388
00:48:41,921 --> 00:48:45,299
Your orders were to restore spice production

389
00:48:45,382 --> 00:48:46,801
to full capacity.

390
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,721
Do you know what it means if you fail?

391
00:48:51,931 --> 00:48:55,142
The Emperor would take spice out of our control.

392
00:48:56,769 --> 00:48:58,771
Tighten your grip, Rabban.

393
00:48:58,938 --> 00:49:00,106
Uncle.

394
00:49:00,439 --> 00:49:02,858
Or feel mine on your neck.

395
00:49:18,749 --> 00:49:22,837
Usul. Usul. It's okay.

396
00:49:23,003 --> 00:49:24,046
It's okay.

397
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:28,008
Hey.

398
00:49:30,845 --> 00:49:32,471
I'm here, I'm here.

399
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,809
It's been a while since you've had one of those nightmares.

400
00:49:37,143 --> 00:49:38,144
Mm.

401
00:49:41,939 --> 00:49:44,150
Tell me, what was it about?

402
00:49:50,281 --> 00:49:53,951
Nothing's clear. It's only fragments.

403
00:49:55,327 --> 00:49:56,662
I'm in the south.

404
00:49:57,621 --> 00:49:59,248
And I'm following someone.

405
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:02,418
And it triggers a holy war.

406
00:50:06,213 --> 00:50:08,299
Millions and millions of people

407
00:50:08,382 --> 00:50:09,842
starving to death...

408
00:50:11,302 --> 00:50:12,386
because of me.

409
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:20,853
You've been exposed to spice for a long time.

410
00:50:20,936 --> 00:50:23,189
It can create weird dreams.

411
00:50:30,446 --> 00:50:31,989
It's a big day.

412
00:50:33,657 --> 00:50:35,201
We can ask Stilgar to call it off.

413
00:50:35,367 --> 00:50:36,493
No.

414
00:50:37,077 --> 00:50:38,078
I'm fine.

415
00:50:53,928 --> 00:50:54,929
Usul.

416
00:50:57,598 --> 00:50:58,891
I tuned it myself.

417
00:51:01,644 --> 00:51:03,020
- Here. - Thanks.

418
00:51:05,606 --> 00:51:07,524
Don't try to impress anyone.

419
00:51:07,608 --> 00:51:11,278
You are brave. We all know that. Heh?

420
00:51:11,362 --> 00:51:12,905
Be simple.

421
00:51:13,072 --> 00:51:14,907
Be direct.

422
00:51:15,074 --> 00:51:16,825
- Nothing fancy. - Nothing fancy.

423
00:51:16,992 --> 00:51:18,285
Hey, I'm serious.

424
00:51:18,452 --> 00:51:20,913
Nothing fancy or you will shame my teaching.

425
00:51:20,996 --> 00:51:23,123
I won't shame you. I understand.

426
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:28,212
Shai-Hulud decides today if you become Fremen,

427
00:51:28,379 --> 00:51:29,713
or if you die.

428
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,098
Hey, Muad'Dib...

429
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:21,640
Lower.

430
00:52:47,624 --> 00:52:49,960
Okay. Okay.

431
00:54:00,197 --> 00:54:01,907
Okay,

432
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:04,535
okay, okay.

433
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:53,292
Okay.

434
00:55:10,893 --> 00:55:13,270
Okay, okay!

435
00:55:19,985 --> 00:55:20,986
Come on!

436
00:55:23,572 --> 00:55:25,157
Whoa!

437
00:56:53,537 --> 00:56:54,705
Go, Muad'Dib!

438
00:56:57,457 --> 00:56:59,167
Muad'Dib!

439
00:58:50,362 --> 00:58:52,656
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I know they do.

440
00:58:55,701 --> 00:58:58,245
Our task in the North is nearly done.

441
00:58:58,328 --> 00:58:59,913
They believe in Paul.

442
00:59:01,081 --> 00:59:03,083
Now we go South.

443
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:06,211
There are millions of fundamentalists there.

444
00:59:07,045 --> 00:59:09,256
They will protect him when he comes.

445
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:16,096
The Kwisatz Haderach will be born in the South.

446
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:31,820
As long as I breathe.

447
00:59:36,283 --> 00:59:37,284
What's wrong?

448
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:44,458
Chani.

449
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:45,751
There will be trouble.

450
00:59:48,086 --> 00:59:49,337
What are you talking about?

451
00:59:53,133 --> 00:59:54,509
Chani, what do you mean?

452
00:59:54,676 --> 00:59:56,011
The way they look at you.

453
00:59:57,554 --> 00:59:58,930
They worship you now.

454
01:00:01,892 --> 01:00:04,394
The Fedaykin, they count your victories.

455
01:00:04,561 --> 01:00:06,772
They say you can see the future.

456
01:00:06,938 --> 01:00:08,607
Whisper Lisan al-Gaib.

457
01:00:09,941 --> 01:00:11,359
I'm no messiah.

458
01:00:14,029 --> 01:00:17,115
I'm a Fedaykin of Sietch Tabr.

459
01:00:17,282 --> 01:00:19,868
Yet, we have a Bene Gesserit among us,

460
01:00:20,035 --> 01:00:21,578
fanning the flames of your legend,

461
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:22,788
saying you're the One.

462
01:00:44,643 --> 01:00:46,019
Mm.

463
01:00:50,482 --> 01:00:52,482
She says you should be coming with us.

464
01:00:53,151 --> 01:00:54,277
You know I can't.

465
01:00:55,153 --> 01:00:56,488
She's asking why.

466
01:00:56,655 --> 01:00:58,615
Because I must continue fighting in the North

467
01:00:58,782 --> 01:01:00,534
to protect you down there in the South.

468
01:01:02,661 --> 01:01:04,996
She says she can tell when you lie.

469
01:01:06,164 --> 01:01:07,165
Tell her that's because

470
01:01:07,249 --> 01:01:09,668
our mother keeps spreading dangerous tales.

471
01:01:17,092 --> 01:01:18,176
What is she saying now?

472
01:01:18,969 --> 01:01:21,304
She says you're blinded by love.

473
01:01:21,471 --> 01:01:23,682
And she reminds you that you must reserve your hand

474
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:25,559
for the most strategic alliance.

475
01:01:28,311 --> 01:01:29,312
She's also wondering

476
01:01:29,396 --> 01:01:31,439
why you don't believe in who you are.

477
01:01:31,523 --> 01:01:32,523
I do believe.

478
01:01:32,899 --> 01:01:34,693
I believe I matter to these people.

479
01:01:36,444 --> 01:01:38,572
I believe I'm making a difference in this war.

480
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:42,117
We're nearly at the gates of the city.

481
01:01:42,284 --> 01:01:43,368
That's not what she means.

482
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:44,911
I know what she means.

483
01:01:45,078 --> 01:01:47,497
Do you not think I also feel the weight of the prophecy?

484
01:01:47,664 --> 01:01:48,748
It's not a prophecy.

485
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:51,293
It's a story that you keep telling,

486
01:01:51,376 --> 01:01:53,253
but it's not their story, it's yours.

487
01:01:53,628 --> 01:01:55,547
They deserve to be led by one of their own.

488
01:01:56,798 --> 01:01:58,118
What your people did to this world

489
01:01:58,174 --> 01:01:59,175
is heartbreaking.

490
01:01:59,259 --> 01:02:00,719
We gave them something to hope for.

491
01:02:00,886 --> 01:02:02,554
That's not hope!

492
01:02:16,776 --> 01:02:18,216
I'll be waiting for you.

493
01:02:19,654 --> 01:02:20,655
All of us.

494
01:03:04,407 --> 01:03:06,618
Those storms look bad.

495
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,041
How much?

496
01:03:55,125 --> 01:03:57,961
We lost eighty percent of our last crop.

497
01:03:58,753 --> 01:04:00,255
My Lord Rabban,

498
01:04:00,422 --> 01:04:02,142
you should not leave the security perimeter.

499
01:04:02,298 --> 01:04:05,135
Security perimeter? The rats are already inside!

500
01:04:05,301 --> 01:04:07,053
The Fremen Demon might be with them.

501
01:04:07,137 --> 01:04:09,556
- I hope so. - We're tracking them, my Lord.

502
01:04:10,515 --> 01:04:13,226
Today, Muad'Dib dies!

503
01:04:54,851 --> 01:04:56,131
Where is he?

504
01:04:56,478 --> 01:04:57,479
Still negative, my Lord.

505
01:04:57,645 --> 01:04:59,481
Why do I have to do everything myself?

506
01:05:02,692 --> 01:05:05,028
- Open range! - Range open.

507
01:05:13,244 --> 01:05:14,829
Life. Delta, delta, delta.

508
01:05:36,267 --> 01:05:37,268
I've lost them.

509
01:05:42,565 --> 01:05:44,484
- Strike! - Yes, my Lord.

510
01:06:51,009 --> 01:06:52,010
Muad'Dib!

511
01:06:53,928 --> 01:06:55,180
Show yourself!

512
01:07:26,628 --> 01:07:28,087
Muad'Dib!

513
01:07:33,426 --> 01:07:34,636
Muad'Dib!

514
01:07:37,472 --> 01:07:41,100
Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!

515
01:08:23,726 --> 01:08:24,727
For Muad'Dib!

516
01:08:38,283 --> 01:08:39,284
Muad'Dib.

517
01:08:41,953 --> 01:08:44,205
Some new Fremen prophet.

518
01:08:45,832 --> 01:08:46,976
It's not the first time

519
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,002
we've had frictions with the Fremen.

520
01:08:49,168 --> 01:08:50,837
None of this magnitude.

521
01:08:54,924 --> 01:08:56,634
So, my dear daughter,

522
01:08:57,802 --> 01:09:00,013
how would you deal with this prophet?

523
01:09:06,394 --> 01:09:09,147
If this Muad'Dib is a religious figure,

524
01:09:10,898 --> 01:09:12,400
you can't use direct force.

525
01:09:14,235 --> 01:09:17,322
Repression only makes a religion flourish.

526
01:09:17,488 --> 01:09:19,615
You'll only end up humiliating yourself.

527
01:09:19,782 --> 01:09:21,284
You underestimate my Sardaukar.

528
01:09:21,367 --> 01:09:24,245
You underestimate the power of faith.

529
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:29,250
Her Highness proves once again

530
01:09:29,334 --> 01:09:31,627
that she was my most acute student.

531
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,090
- You'd send assassins? - No.

532
01:09:36,716 --> 01:09:38,384
Prophets get stronger when they die.

533
01:09:40,303 --> 01:09:42,221
Let the conflict on Arrakis turn into war.

534
01:09:42,847 --> 01:09:44,140
You then bring peace.

535
01:09:45,141 --> 01:09:46,142
As a savior.

536
01:09:48,436 --> 01:09:50,229
You'd be a formidable empress.

537
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:55,651
Muad'Dib.

538
01:09:56,444 --> 01:09:59,280
The prophet. The one who points the way.

539
01:10:00,365 --> 01:10:01,633
These are our own religious patterns,

540
01:10:01,657 --> 01:10:02,658
aren't they?

541
01:10:02,825 --> 01:10:03,826
This is our doing.

542
01:10:07,538 --> 01:10:10,625
Muad'Dib means kangaroo mouse,

543
01:10:10,708 --> 01:10:12,543
an unusual war name for a Fremen.

544
01:10:14,754 --> 01:10:16,756
What if Paul Atreides were still alive?

545
01:10:16,964 --> 01:10:19,592
Enough! This must not come out.

546
01:10:19,967 --> 01:10:22,136
Even to your father's ears. Understand?

547
01:10:23,054 --> 01:10:24,180
I do, Reverend Mother.

548
01:10:25,973 --> 01:10:27,284
If Paul is alive,

549
01:10:27,308 --> 01:10:28,643
he likely knows the truth.

550
01:10:29,227 --> 01:10:30,853
And should the Great Houses learn

551
01:10:30,937 --> 01:10:32,563
that your father was behind

552
01:10:32,647 --> 01:10:34,440
the liquidation of the Atreides,

553
01:10:34,857 --> 01:10:38,027
your father will face war and lose the throne.

554
01:10:39,862 --> 01:10:41,239
Then what hope is there?

555
01:10:42,698 --> 01:10:43,699
Hope?

556
01:10:45,034 --> 01:10:46,536
We are Bene Gesserit.

557
01:10:47,328 --> 01:10:49,288
We don't hope, we plan.

558
01:10:50,456 --> 01:10:53,167
Paul is not our only prospect.

559
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:57,880
The Baron's youngest nephew, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen,

560
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,507
will inherit Arrakis.

561
01:11:01,008 --> 01:11:02,009
He may be the answer.

562
01:11:02,593 --> 01:11:05,179
Feyd-Rautha? He's psychotic.

563
01:11:05,346 --> 01:11:06,472
That's irrelevant.

564
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:08,891
The question is,

565
01:11:09,058 --> 01:11:10,601
can we control him?

566
01:11:11,561 --> 01:11:12,979
And I intend to find out.

567
01:11:36,335 --> 01:11:38,838
Would you like some fresh meat, my darlings?

568
01:11:40,006 --> 01:11:42,508
Lungs? Or liver?

569
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:45,386
What would you like? I hear they're big today.

570
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:47,430
Your new blades

571
01:11:47,763 --> 01:11:50,433
for this very special day,

572
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:53,436
na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha.

573
01:12:21,923 --> 01:12:23,243
A notch off balance.

574
01:12:23,508 --> 01:12:24,509
It's the tip.

575
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:27,094
Should be sharper.

576
01:12:41,567 --> 01:12:42,735
Come.

577
01:12:43,152 --> 01:12:44,612
I won't die like a fool.

578
01:12:44,987 --> 01:12:46,239
Kill me now.

579
01:12:46,405 --> 01:12:48,908
No drug for you today, Atreides.

580
01:14:04,525 --> 01:14:06,485
Welcome to Giedi Prime, sisters.

581
01:14:06,652 --> 01:14:08,529
I hope your travels were agreeable.

582
01:14:08,613 --> 01:14:09,923
A long way to come

583
01:14:09,947 --> 01:14:11,741
just to watch our prospect risk his life,

584
01:14:11,824 --> 01:14:12,950
Lady Fenring.

585
01:14:13,034 --> 01:14:14,118
No fear.

586
01:14:14,994 --> 01:14:16,621
These fights are all for show.

587
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:19,957
But we'll get a good look at him.

588
01:14:23,002 --> 01:14:25,004
Feyd-Rautha!

589
01:16:00,891 --> 01:16:02,371
That slave isn't drugged.

590
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:04,895
That bug is walking straight.

591
01:16:06,105 --> 01:16:07,314
We should cancel the fight.

592
01:16:07,398 --> 01:16:10,192
Don't spoil my nephew's birthday.

593
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:00,534
Happy birthday, dear nephew.

594
01:17:17,343 --> 01:17:19,196
Why do they not stop the fight?

595
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:20,471
Plans within plans.

596
01:17:25,976 --> 01:17:27,436
Show me who you are.

597
01:17:44,578 --> 01:17:45,704
There he is.

598
01:18:30,708 --> 01:18:32,334
Back! Back!

599
01:18:48,893 --> 01:18:51,312
Stay back!

600
01:19:05,159 --> 01:19:07,077
You fought well, Atreides.

601
01:19:19,173 --> 01:19:25,387
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

602
01:19:26,013 --> 01:19:28,390
Feyd-Rautha!

603
01:19:29,099 --> 01:19:30,476
He's impressive, indeed.

604
01:19:30,643 --> 01:19:34,772
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

605
01:19:34,855 --> 01:19:38,817
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

606
01:19:42,237 --> 01:19:44,531
The slave wasn't drugged.

607
01:19:45,074 --> 01:19:48,202
You tried to kill me?

608
01:19:48,953 --> 01:19:51,455
This morning you were a playboy,

609
01:19:51,538 --> 01:19:53,248
feared and envied,

610
01:19:53,415 --> 01:19:56,627
but tonight you're a hero.

611
01:19:56,794 --> 01:19:57,795
My gift to you.

612
01:19:58,379 --> 01:20:00,381
I ought to drown you in that tub.

613
01:20:01,882 --> 01:20:03,342
Don't be hasty.

614
01:20:04,176 --> 01:20:07,972
I have another gift for you. A bigger one.

615
01:20:09,473 --> 01:20:11,266
Arrakis.

616
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:16,146
What about Rabban?

617
01:20:16,313 --> 01:20:19,191
He has failed to protect spice production.

618
01:20:19,608 --> 01:20:22,027
Rabban will be reassigned.

619
01:20:25,447 --> 01:20:27,074
Tame Arrakis, Feyd.

620
01:20:28,283 --> 01:20:31,453
Free the spice. I'll make you emperor.

621
01:20:43,424 --> 01:20:45,134
Emperor?

622
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,221
How?

623
01:20:51,306 --> 01:20:54,226
The Emperor helped me destroy the Atreides.

624
01:20:55,728 --> 01:20:58,313
He lent his own army to the cause.

625
01:20:58,397 --> 01:20:59,690
A serious crime.

626
01:21:00,858 --> 01:21:02,443
If it came to light,

627
01:21:02,609 --> 01:21:05,904
the Great Houses would rise against him.

628
01:21:06,071 --> 01:21:07,072
And then,

629
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:10,868
who will sit on the throne?

630
01:21:11,785 --> 01:21:14,830
Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.

631
01:21:55,454 --> 01:21:56,580
You're following me.

632
01:21:58,123 --> 01:21:59,124
Am I?

633
01:22:01,126 --> 01:22:02,544
I may have gotten lost.

634
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:07,424
Will you show me the way out of this maze,

635
01:22:07,549 --> 01:22:09,176
my Lord na-Baron?

636
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,519
We've met, haven't we?

637
01:22:22,106 --> 01:22:23,148
I don't think so.

638
01:22:24,233 --> 01:22:25,818
I'm Lady Margot Fenring.

639
01:22:26,777 --> 01:22:28,987
I'm here to honor your coming of age.

640
01:22:29,154 --> 01:22:31,156
You're not allowed in this section.

641
01:22:31,949 --> 01:22:33,450
How did you get past the guards?

642
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:34,701
The guards?

643
01:22:37,788 --> 01:22:39,456
May I ask, what are you doing here?

644
01:22:41,959 --> 01:22:45,254
You're not taking part in your own celebrations?

645
01:22:55,931 --> 01:22:57,432
You're Bene Gesserit.

646
01:22:58,517 --> 01:23:01,353
And what makes you say that?

647
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,897
I remember now.

648
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:06,650
I dreamed about you last night.

649
01:23:06,817 --> 01:23:08,377
A pleasant dream, I hope.

650
01:23:08,402 --> 01:23:09,762
Don't mock me, woman.

651
01:23:09,903 --> 01:23:11,155
I wouldn't dare.

652
01:23:13,782 --> 01:23:16,451
I know your Bene Gesserit tricks.

653
01:23:16,535 --> 01:23:17,595
And what do you know

654
01:23:17,619 --> 01:23:18,745
about the Bene Gesserit?

655
01:23:22,749 --> 01:23:23,750
Tell me.

656
01:23:28,046 --> 01:23:29,131
Something wrong?

657
01:23:29,298 --> 01:23:31,300
I don't recognize this place.

658
01:23:32,176 --> 01:23:33,635
This is the guest wing.

659
01:23:36,638 --> 01:23:37,958
Where are you going?

660
01:23:39,641 --> 01:23:40,642
To my room.

661
01:24:08,337 --> 01:24:10,005
Come...

662
01:24:10,172 --> 01:24:11,965
To...

663
01:24:12,132 --> 01:24:13,508
Me.

664
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:17,554
Kneel.

665
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:34,363
Put your right hand in the box.

666
01:24:49,753 --> 01:24:53,215
A sociopath. Of high intelligence.

667
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:55,342
Driven. Cruel.

668
01:24:55,717 --> 01:24:57,511
But strongly motivated by honor.

669
01:24:58,679 --> 01:24:59,930
He yearns to be hurt.

670
01:25:00,847 --> 01:25:01,848
He loves pain.

671
01:25:02,808 --> 01:25:04,244
Can he be redeemed?

672
01:25:04,268 --> 01:25:05,668
He can be controlled.

673
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:07,729
He's sexually vulnerable.

674
01:25:09,773 --> 01:25:10,774
And?

675
01:25:12,401 --> 01:25:13,735
The bloodline is secured.

676
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:18,240
Female, as you requested.

677
01:25:19,491 --> 01:25:20,534
You did well, Margot.

678
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:24,538
Respectfully, why didn't you test him yourself?

679
01:25:26,581 --> 01:25:28,166
I'm a motherly figure.

680
01:25:29,084 --> 01:25:30,377
And based on what happened

681
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:32,504
between him and his own mother,

682
01:25:32,671 --> 01:25:34,756
I didn't expect to be effective.

683
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:36,940
What happened between him and his mother?

684
01:25:37,426 --> 01:25:38,427
He murdered her.

685
01:25:39,928 --> 01:25:42,764
Desire and humiliation.

686
01:25:44,224 --> 01:25:45,684
Those are his levers.

687
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:49,229
If Feyd-Rautha prevails on Arrakis,

688
01:25:49,646 --> 01:25:51,898
we shall know how to control him.

689
01:26:12,753 --> 01:26:15,172
Rid me of this Fremen Demon.

690
01:26:27,934 --> 01:26:33,648
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

691
01:26:34,149 --> 01:26:39,738
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

692
01:27:00,467 --> 01:27:04,262
Do away with these idiots I blame

693
01:27:05,722 --> 01:27:09,351
The stillsuit is full of piss

694
01:27:10,852 --> 01:27:15,065
My hand is caked in sand

695
01:27:16,817 --> 01:27:19,152
Save me from these utter morons

696
01:27:19,236 --> 01:27:20,612
Another world

697
01:27:21,613 --> 01:27:22,823
Another land

698
01:27:22,906 --> 01:27:23,907
We're in.

699
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,079
Juicy?

700
01:27:29,246 --> 01:27:30,831
Juicy, juicy.

701
01:27:33,542 --> 01:27:35,062
Well, it was nice knowing ya.

702
01:27:35,127 --> 01:27:36,169
Oh, yeah?

703
01:27:36,795 --> 01:27:38,422
Radar's clear. We're clear.

704
01:27:40,257 --> 01:27:41,258
Cooking time.

705
01:28:01,194 --> 01:28:02,571
Juicy, juicy.

706
01:28:02,988 --> 01:28:04,173
Yeah, I got a meter reading...

707
01:28:04,197 --> 01:28:05,967
All right, guys, worms are on their way.

708
01:28:05,991 --> 01:28:07,051
Watch out for abrasions.

709
01:28:07,075 --> 01:28:08,136
Get ready to dock.

710
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:09,637
It's gonna get hot when we get started.

711
01:28:09,661 --> 01:28:11,705
All right, move it!

712
01:28:13,707 --> 01:28:15,601
- Crank them up! - Start them up!

713
01:28:15,625 --> 01:28:17,065
Yeah, I'm moving, I'm moving.

714
01:28:44,321 --> 01:28:45,614
Hold!

715
01:28:59,836 --> 01:29:01,046
Mine! Mine!

716
01:29:01,129 --> 01:29:02,172
Get moving!

717
01:29:03,048 --> 01:29:04,883
Come on!

718
01:29:06,927 --> 01:29:07,928
East! East!

719
01:29:08,178 --> 01:29:09,346
Get clear!

720
01:29:15,936 --> 01:29:16,996
Let's get outta here.

721
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:19,272
Incoming!

722
01:29:22,692 --> 01:29:24,402
Don't run, fight!

723
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:28,031
We're in deep Fremen shit.

724
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:31,535
Holy Mother.

725
01:29:41,294 --> 01:29:43,922
- Go, go, go now! - Fuck, fuck!

726
01:29:44,923 --> 01:29:45,924
Get out!

727
01:29:47,259 --> 01:29:48,677
We gotta run!

728
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:50,262
What the heck, let's go!

729
01:30:01,064 --> 01:30:02,732
I recognized your footsteps,

730
01:30:03,775 --> 01:30:05,360
old man.

731
01:30:30,427 --> 01:30:31,761
You young pup.

732
01:30:32,554 --> 01:30:33,805
You young pup.

733
01:30:36,558 --> 01:30:38,435
Ah!

734
01:30:41,646 --> 01:30:44,024
Well, after the Battle of Arrakeen,

735
01:30:44,190 --> 01:30:46,318
I was able to negotiate a trip back home

736
01:30:46,401 --> 01:30:47,402
for the survivors.

737
01:30:48,737 --> 01:30:49,946
Thanks to these guys.

738
01:30:50,947 --> 01:30:52,324
Why'd you stay?

739
01:30:53,325 --> 01:30:55,243
I wanted blood.

740
01:30:56,828 --> 01:30:58,913
Rabban's head?

741
01:30:58,997 --> 01:31:00,582
Mm-hmm.

742
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:04,210
Since Muad'Dib has been driving Rabban crazy,

743
01:31:04,294 --> 01:31:08,256
the smuggling business has been quite profitable.

744
01:31:09,049 --> 01:31:10,800
Gurney Halleck the smuggler.

745
01:31:12,969 --> 01:31:14,471
Paul Muad'Dib.

746
01:31:15,430 --> 01:31:18,099
I've heard many stories about Muad'Dib.

747
01:31:19,309 --> 01:31:21,227
None of them pretty.

748
01:31:22,062 --> 01:31:23,813
You see the fear?

749
01:31:25,148 --> 01:31:26,900
When our resources are limited,

750
01:31:29,569 --> 01:31:30,987
fear is all we have.

751
01:31:48,838 --> 01:31:50,340
How many men with you?

752
01:31:50,507 --> 01:31:51,987
- Two Hundred. - Two Hundred?

753
01:31:52,676 --> 01:31:53,760
Shh!

754
01:31:57,138 --> 01:32:00,100
Do you realize what you're able to achieve with 200 men?

755
01:32:01,434 --> 01:32:02,435
Incredible fighters.

756
01:32:03,144 --> 01:32:04,664
Duncan said there were millions of them.

757
01:32:04,688 --> 01:32:06,314
In the Deep South, yes.

758
01:32:06,398 --> 01:32:07,958
Well, what are you waiting for?

759
01:32:08,692 --> 01:32:09,943
With thousands of these guys,

760
01:32:10,026 --> 01:32:11,945
you could take control of the entire planet.

761
01:32:12,112 --> 01:32:13,154
It's your father's dream.

762
01:32:13,238 --> 01:32:15,158
- What are you afraid of? - Hey.

763
01:32:17,283 --> 01:32:18,993
Worship, Gurney.

764
01:32:20,286 --> 01:32:21,538
They used to be friends.

765
01:32:23,206 --> 01:32:24,416
Now they're followers.

766
01:32:24,582 --> 01:32:26,501
Muad'Dib, the Prophet.

767
01:32:26,668 --> 01:32:28,461
Why is that a bad thing? Use it.

768
01:32:28,545 --> 01:32:29,587
It's not that simple.

769
01:32:29,671 --> 01:32:31,271
You have the power to avenge your father,

770
01:32:31,297 --> 01:32:32,590
and you're afraid to use it?

771
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,969
Spice opened my mind, Gurney.

772
01:32:36,886 --> 01:32:38,304
I can foresee things.

773
01:32:40,223 --> 01:32:41,224
If I go South,

774
01:32:41,391 --> 01:32:44,144
all my visions lead to horror.

775
01:32:44,310 --> 01:32:47,480
Billions of corpses scattered across the galaxy.

776
01:32:47,647 --> 01:32:49,274
All dying because of me.

777
01:32:50,066 --> 01:32:51,276
Because you lose control?

778
01:32:53,319 --> 01:32:55,071
Because I gain it.

779
01:33:13,298 --> 01:33:15,258
That's a lot of water.

780
01:33:17,218 --> 01:33:18,261
Chani.

781
01:33:18,344 --> 01:33:20,638
What? Look at him, he's hopeless.

782
01:33:21,097 --> 01:33:22,098
He's family.

783
01:33:25,643 --> 01:33:26,644
Really?

784
01:33:54,464 --> 01:33:55,858
No need to be a prophet

785
01:33:55,882 --> 01:33:57,091
to see what's ahead.

786
01:33:59,969 --> 01:34:01,346
Your path leads to war.

787
01:34:03,181 --> 01:34:04,182
You know that.

788
01:34:06,643 --> 01:34:08,520
So, war is coming.

789
01:34:09,020 --> 01:34:10,021
What will you do

790
01:34:10,104 --> 01:34:12,607
when you feel its breath upon your neck?

791
01:34:16,236 --> 01:34:18,530
If you don't want to raise an army in the South,

792
01:34:18,696 --> 01:34:20,114
you may still have an option.

793
01:34:23,618 --> 01:34:24,661
Firepower,

794
01:34:26,329 --> 01:34:28,373
which you don't have.

795
01:34:30,124 --> 01:34:31,125
And here I am.

796
01:34:35,672 --> 01:34:38,049
I know where your father hid the family atomics.

797
01:34:43,596 --> 01:34:46,975
Every House possesses an atomic arsenal.

798
01:34:47,809 --> 01:34:49,561
I thought ours had been lost.

799
01:34:51,938 --> 01:34:54,482
It's huge, Chani. It could change everything.

800
01:34:59,863 --> 01:35:02,532
I could aim the bombs at the main spice fields.

801
01:35:04,951 --> 01:35:08,288
He who can destroy a thing has the real control of it.

802
01:35:09,873 --> 01:35:11,499
So, you can control it and not us?

803
01:35:13,751 --> 01:35:15,628
You promised me you didn't want power.

804
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:19,424
No matter what I do, you still don't trust me.

805
01:35:19,591 --> 01:35:22,385
'Cause you're a foreigner. Like your friend.

806
01:35:24,512 --> 01:35:25,513
I'm not a foreigner.

807
01:35:33,897 --> 01:35:35,189
Not to me.

808
01:35:35,356 --> 01:35:36,900
But to the desert, you are.

809
01:35:37,859 --> 01:35:40,028
My allegiance is to you.

810
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:41,821
To the Fremen.

811
01:35:41,988 --> 01:35:43,990
I'm doing this for all of us.

812
01:35:45,325 --> 01:35:46,325
Do you believe me?

813
01:35:54,876 --> 01:35:56,127
I'll talk to Stilgar.

814
01:36:04,093 --> 01:36:05,094
There.

815
01:36:09,349 --> 01:36:12,518
It's right under everybody's noses.

816
01:36:13,853 --> 01:36:14,854
Not clever.

817
01:36:15,355 --> 01:36:16,773
That's the idea.

818
01:36:16,856 --> 01:36:18,000
Nobody would ever look in there

819
01:36:18,024 --> 01:36:20,234
because it's obvious.

820
01:36:21,986 --> 01:36:23,488
Not clever.

821
01:36:23,988 --> 01:36:25,239
Did you find it?

822
01:36:25,573 --> 01:36:27,700
I didn't look for it.

823
01:36:27,784 --> 01:36:29,035
How many heads exactly?

824
01:36:30,912 --> 01:36:32,914
Enough to blow up the whole planet.

825
01:36:35,959 --> 01:36:37,919
It's a figure of speech.

826
01:36:39,212 --> 01:36:40,380
You know what I mean.

827
01:37:03,027 --> 01:37:04,988
Only with your genetic heritage.

828
01:37:44,986 --> 01:37:47,822
Your great-great-grandfather's legacy.

829
01:37:48,531 --> 01:37:52,201
The 92 original Atreides family's atomic warheads.

830
01:37:55,121 --> 01:37:58,374
Now that, that is power.

831
01:38:05,214 --> 01:38:06,758
Imperial Diary,

832
01:38:07,216 --> 01:38:09,385
year 10,191.

833
01:38:09,844 --> 01:38:10,887
Eighth comment.

834
01:38:11,888 --> 01:38:14,766
Reports from the south of Arrakis arrive rarely.

835
01:38:15,725 --> 01:38:19,187
These are barren, burnt lands hidden by sandstorms,

836
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,898
which stretch a thousand miles across the equator.

837
01:38:23,775 --> 01:38:25,943
Nothing can live there without faith.

838
01:38:27,779 --> 01:38:30,114
Which is why our Bene Gesserit missionaries

839
01:38:30,198 --> 01:38:32,575
have been so productive there.

840
01:38:35,078 --> 01:38:36,704
Through them, we are receiving reports

841
01:38:36,788 --> 01:38:38,081
of a mysterious figure

842
01:38:38,164 --> 01:38:39,916
taking grip on the imaginations

843
01:38:39,999 --> 01:38:42,210
of the Southern fundamentalist tribes.

844
01:38:43,586 --> 01:38:46,339
A new Reverend Mother from the North,

845
01:38:47,048 --> 01:38:48,883
spreading word of the imminent arrival

846
01:38:48,966 --> 01:38:51,219
of the Lisan al-Gaib,

847
01:38:51,385 --> 01:38:53,012
the Voice from the Outer World.

848
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:57,016
With religious fervor rising in the South,

849
01:38:57,767 --> 01:39:01,521
and Muad'Dib strangling spice production in the North,

850
01:39:01,604 --> 01:39:04,899
everything points to the escalation of war.

851
01:39:25,044 --> 01:39:26,045
Hmm.

852
01:39:35,054 --> 01:39:36,055
Quiet.

853
01:41:25,206 --> 01:41:26,406
Listen carefully.

854
01:41:26,958 --> 01:41:28,518
Soon a man is going to visit your temple

855
01:41:28,584 --> 01:41:30,628
and he may want you to perform the rites.

856
01:41:31,337 --> 01:41:33,923
Reverend Mother, it is forbidden.

857
01:41:39,595 --> 01:41:41,555
Let him try.

858
01:42:26,142 --> 01:42:27,143
What the hell?

859
01:42:30,563 --> 01:42:31,897
Chani!

860
01:42:38,321 --> 01:42:39,864
Chani!

861
01:42:43,284 --> 01:42:44,284
Chani.

862
01:42:54,754 --> 01:42:55,921
Sietch Tabr.

863
01:43:20,196 --> 01:43:21,836
Old fashioned artillery.

864
01:43:22,948 --> 01:43:24,075
Genius.

865
01:43:24,909 --> 01:43:27,536
We're literally melting rock on their heads.

866
01:43:27,703 --> 01:43:30,664
I want to go on the ground. Prepare my troops.

867
01:43:30,831 --> 01:43:32,917
My Lord. I would recommend you stay inside.

868
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,144
There was...

869
01:43:34,168 --> 01:43:35,878
Bring his body to my quarters.

870
01:43:37,213 --> 01:43:39,340
My poor darlings are hungry.

871
01:43:39,507 --> 01:43:41,107
There was no food for them on the flight.

872
01:43:42,885 --> 01:43:45,096
What are you doing here?

873
01:43:45,262 --> 01:43:46,389
It's early morning.

874
01:43:46,555 --> 01:43:48,349
What are you doing here?

875
01:43:48,516 --> 01:43:50,226
Kiss my feet, brother.

876
01:43:50,393 --> 01:43:51,453
I'm gonna eviscerate your...

877
01:43:57,358 --> 01:44:00,027
You humiliated our family.

878
01:44:01,112 --> 01:44:03,030
You humiliated me.

879
01:44:03,864 --> 01:44:04,865
Kiss,

880
01:44:06,158 --> 01:44:07,158
or die.

881
01:44:15,126 --> 01:44:16,127
Mm.

882
01:44:17,336 --> 01:44:18,379
We're even now.

883
01:44:24,927 --> 01:44:26,238
Embarrass our family

884
01:44:26,262 --> 01:44:27,430
one more time,

885
01:44:28,597 --> 01:44:29,849
it will be the last.

886
01:45:05,217 --> 01:45:07,177
They didn't even engage on the ground

887
01:45:07,344 --> 01:45:09,805
like honorable fighters.

888
01:45:42,129 --> 01:45:43,297
Usul,

889
01:45:43,464 --> 01:45:44,465
in the South,

890
01:45:45,299 --> 01:45:47,718
only leaders are allowed to speak.

891
01:45:49,053 --> 01:45:50,304
You must take my place.

892
01:45:50,930 --> 01:45:51,931
I can't do that.

893
01:45:52,056 --> 01:45:54,475
It is a good time to cross blades with me.

894
01:45:54,642 --> 01:45:57,937
I am weak. I am an easy kill, Muad'Dib.

895
01:45:58,062 --> 01:45:59,396
I'd rather cut off my own hand.

896
01:45:59,563 --> 01:46:00,564
We need you.

897
01:46:00,648 --> 01:46:02,816
We need the Lisan al-Gaib to lead our people.

898
01:46:03,150 --> 01:46:04,586
You know what I think of all that, Stilgar.

899
01:46:04,610 --> 01:46:07,404
I don't care what you believe. I believe.

900
01:46:21,585 --> 01:46:22,670
I didn't see it coming.

901
01:46:24,755 --> 01:46:26,382
The Harkonnens aren't done here.

902
01:46:27,591 --> 01:46:29,009
They just went back to reload.

903
01:46:30,094 --> 01:46:31,720
We're setting thumpers.

904
01:46:31,804 --> 01:46:33,264
We're moving everyone to the South.

905
01:46:33,347 --> 01:46:35,099
I'll stay behind and cover your retreat.

906
01:46:35,266 --> 01:46:38,060
- What are you talking about? - Chani, I can't go with you.

907
01:46:38,143 --> 01:46:39,603
You know why.

908
01:46:39,687 --> 01:46:41,814
- I'll stay, too. - Nobody stays but me.

909
01:46:41,981 --> 01:46:43,083
- Paul. - That's an order,

910
01:46:43,107 --> 01:46:44,525
Gurney Halleck. Go South!

911
01:46:44,692 --> 01:46:45,776
Protect my mother.

912
01:46:48,195 --> 01:46:49,515
- My Lord. - Muad'Dib.

913
01:46:59,582 --> 01:47:01,462
He's afraid of the fundamentalists.

914
01:47:02,793 --> 01:47:03,794
And he should be.

915
01:47:17,433 --> 01:47:19,033
Don't resist.

916
01:47:25,941 --> 01:47:27,359
Talk to me, Jamis.

917
01:47:34,283 --> 01:47:36,118
Kwisatz Haderach.

918
01:47:38,412 --> 01:47:40,748
You see only fragments.

919
01:47:42,499 --> 01:47:46,170
You cannot see the future without seeing the past.

920
01:47:48,756 --> 01:47:50,382
To unlock your mind,

921
01:47:50,466 --> 01:47:53,218
you need to drink the Water of Life,

922
01:47:53,385 --> 01:47:56,096
and you will see everything.

923
01:47:59,475 --> 01:48:01,685
A good hunter always climbs the highest dune

924
01:48:01,769 --> 01:48:03,270
before his hunt.

925
01:48:04,730 --> 01:48:05,939
He needs to see...

926
01:48:07,900 --> 01:48:09,485
as far as he can see.

927
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:16,033
You need to see.

928
01:48:18,702 --> 01:48:21,205
You must drink the Water of Life.

929
01:48:22,122 --> 01:48:23,749
Your mind, it's gonna open...

930
01:48:26,168 --> 01:48:27,503
...and you will see.

931
01:48:46,188 --> 01:48:48,107
The world has made choices for us.

932
01:48:53,237 --> 01:48:54,905
If I go South, I might lose you.

933
01:48:55,072 --> 01:48:56,699
You will never lose me,

934
01:48:58,033 --> 01:48:59,243
Paul Atreides.

935
01:49:01,245 --> 01:49:03,372
Not as long as you stay who you are.

936
01:49:11,046 --> 01:49:13,090
I'll cross the storms with you.

937
01:49:13,173 --> 01:49:14,174
Go South.

938
01:49:15,759 --> 01:49:17,177
Bring your people to safety.

939
01:49:23,267 --> 01:49:25,853
And then I will do what must be done.

940
01:49:50,210 --> 01:49:51,336
Where?

941
01:49:51,503 --> 01:49:53,297
Spy. Left behind.

942
01:49:54,006 --> 01:49:55,424
No trace of the others.

943
01:49:55,507 --> 01:49:58,427
They've gone South to hide in the storms.

944
01:50:03,474 --> 01:50:05,017
Send this message to the Baron.

945
01:50:05,184 --> 01:50:07,311
The North is liberated and secured.

946
01:50:07,478 --> 01:50:09,897
Harvest spice at will.

947
01:50:10,063 --> 01:50:11,356
Yes, na-Baron.

948
01:50:26,121 --> 01:50:29,458
You killed nine of my men with one single blade.

949
01:50:31,043 --> 01:50:32,753
She won't talk.

950
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:34,713
Tell her that's fine.

951
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:37,090
I already know everything I need to know.

952
01:50:44,223 --> 01:50:46,892
Only pleasure remains.

953
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:54,353
Now that you can see

954
01:52:54,436 --> 01:52:55,854
our past...

955
01:52:56,021 --> 01:52:59,399
See our past,

956
01:52:59,566 --> 01:53:01,944
you can see your future.

957
01:53:02,110 --> 01:53:05,364
See your future.

958
01:53:23,632 --> 01:53:25,068
My brother,

959
01:53:25,092 --> 01:53:26,635
my dearest brother,

960
01:53:27,511 --> 01:53:30,097
you are not prepared for what is to come.

961
01:53:31,974 --> 01:53:35,435
You'll now learn the truth about our family.

962
01:53:35,602 --> 01:53:39,106
And it will hurt you to the core.

963
01:53:40,565 --> 01:53:41,608
Paul,

964
01:53:42,609 --> 01:53:44,277
don't worry.

965
01:53:44,444 --> 01:53:45,570
I'm with you.

966
01:53:47,030 --> 01:53:48,407
I love you.

967
01:54:01,586 --> 01:54:02,906
Find them.

968
01:54:32,492 --> 01:54:34,745
Paul? Paul.

969
01:54:37,622 --> 01:54:38,707
I'm here, I'm here.

970
01:54:39,291 --> 01:54:40,292
Hey.

971
01:54:43,712 --> 01:54:44,921
What happened?

972
01:54:46,423 --> 01:54:48,050
What happened?

973
01:54:58,268 --> 01:54:59,269
He's dead.

974
01:54:59,436 --> 01:55:02,230
His vital signs are so low, they can't be detected.

975
01:55:02,689 --> 01:55:03,690
But he's alive.

976
01:55:04,524 --> 01:55:05,525
What did you do to him?

977
01:55:07,194 --> 01:55:09,571
No, not that. Why would he do that?

978
01:55:09,738 --> 01:55:10,822
Why would you do that?

979
01:55:19,498 --> 01:55:21,666
Chani, his body is fighting the poison

980
01:55:21,750 --> 01:55:22,834
and he needs your help.

981
01:55:22,918 --> 01:55:23,960
You do it.

982
01:55:25,504 --> 01:55:26,505
You did this to him.

983
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:29,257
You did this to your own son. You do it.

984
01:55:29,424 --> 01:55:30,425
Fix it yourself.

985
01:55:30,509 --> 01:55:33,261
Chani, you might not believe in the prophecy,

986
01:55:33,345 --> 01:55:34,679
but you're a part of it.

987
01:55:34,846 --> 01:55:36,473
You're the poison.

988
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:38,100
You and your lies.

989
01:55:38,266 --> 01:55:40,026
- Why would you do this? - Do it.

990
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:06,336
Desert Spring tears.

991
01:56:30,819 --> 01:56:33,989
Kwisatz Haderach,

992
01:56:34,156 --> 01:56:35,866
climb up.

993
01:56:36,032 --> 01:56:37,826
Arise.

994
01:56:47,711 --> 01:56:48,879
Usul, I'm here. I'm here.

995
01:56:58,805 --> 01:57:00,223
Are you okay?

996
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:01,391
Yes.

997
01:57:10,525 --> 01:57:11,568
Are you sure?

998
01:57:15,822 --> 01:57:17,532
Thanks to you.

999
01:58:03,078 --> 01:58:04,746
I'm sorry about Chani.

1000
01:58:06,331 --> 01:58:10,168
She'll come to understand. I've seen it.

1001
01:58:11,878 --> 01:58:13,171
You can see?

1002
01:58:13,838 --> 01:58:16,424
The visions are clear now.

1003
01:58:18,385 --> 01:58:20,762
I see possible futures.

1004
01:58:20,929 --> 01:58:22,138
All at once.

1005
01:58:23,139 --> 01:58:25,392
Our enemies are all around us.

1006
01:58:26,601 --> 01:58:28,728
And in so many futures, they prevail.

1007
01:58:30,063 --> 01:58:31,523
But I do see a way.

1008
01:58:33,149 --> 01:58:35,860
There is a narrow way through.

1009
01:58:45,704 --> 01:58:47,330
I saw our bloodline, Mother.

1010
01:58:48,790 --> 01:58:50,208
Written across time.

1011
01:59:02,971 --> 01:59:06,182
You are the daughter of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

1012
01:59:08,435 --> 01:59:09,728
Did my father know?

1013
01:59:15,942 --> 01:59:17,152
I didn't know myself,

1014
01:59:17,235 --> 01:59:19,112
until I took the worm's poison.

1015
01:59:26,995 --> 01:59:28,538
We're Harkonnens.

1016
01:59:32,584 --> 01:59:34,753
So this is how we will survive.

1017
01:59:36,463 --> 01:59:37,839
By being Harkonnens.

1018
02:01:15,103 --> 02:01:16,104
We must talk.

1019
02:01:18,189 --> 02:01:20,483
Stilgar, you can stop this.

1020
02:01:20,567 --> 02:01:22,527
Do you hear me? You have the power to stop this.

1021
02:01:22,694 --> 02:01:24,028
Northern Woman!

1022
02:01:24,112 --> 02:01:25,952
You are not allowed to speak inside the circle.

1023
02:01:26,322 --> 02:01:27,633
If you want to speak, you know what to do.

1024
02:01:27,657 --> 02:01:28,658
Stilgar, please.

1025
02:01:30,076 --> 02:01:31,161
For Arrakis' sake.

1026
02:01:44,007 --> 02:01:46,259
This prophecy is how they enslave us!

1027
02:01:46,342 --> 02:01:47,719
How they dominate...

1028
02:01:48,970 --> 02:01:50,346
You'll get yourself in trouble.

1029
02:01:50,430 --> 02:01:51,931
This is none of your business.

1030
02:01:52,098 --> 02:01:53,975
Rabban Harkonnen himself killed my family.

1031
02:01:54,058 --> 02:01:55,977
He gave me this scar to remember him by.

1032
02:01:56,144 --> 02:01:57,896
This is all of my business.

1033
02:02:43,608 --> 02:02:44,609
Mahdi, Mahdi.

1034
02:02:45,151 --> 02:02:47,195
Only tribe leaders can speak.

1035
02:02:47,529 --> 02:02:49,322
If you wish to share your voice,

1036
02:02:49,405 --> 02:02:50,823
you must take his place

1037
02:02:51,157 --> 02:02:52,283
by defeating him

1038
02:02:52,367 --> 02:02:54,827
and returning his water to the well.

1039
02:02:54,994 --> 02:02:56,204
You think I'm stupid enough

1040
02:02:56,287 --> 02:02:58,331
to deprive myself of the best of us?

1041
02:03:03,002 --> 02:03:04,254
Take my life, Usul.

1042
02:03:05,630 --> 02:03:07,131
It is the only way.

1043
02:03:07,507 --> 02:03:08,550
I'm pointing the way!

1044
02:03:11,594 --> 02:03:12,762
Slow down.

1045
02:03:48,464 --> 02:03:50,464
But you think you could have a chance.

1046
02:04:34,510 --> 02:04:35,595
Dune.

1047
02:04:36,262 --> 02:04:37,263
Lisan al-Gaib!

1048
02:04:37,347 --> 02:04:39,974
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1049
02:04:40,141 --> 02:04:41,225
Mahdi.

1050
02:04:41,351 --> 02:04:42,685
Lisan al-Gaib!

1051
02:04:54,030 --> 02:04:55,823
- Muad'Dib. - Muad'Dib.

1052
02:05:21,307 --> 02:05:23,351
This is my father's ducal signet.

1053
02:05:34,028 --> 02:05:36,280
I am Paul Muad'Dib Atreides,

1054
02:05:36,364 --> 02:05:37,657
Duke of Arrakis.

1055
02:05:48,376 --> 02:05:49,919
Lisan al-Gaib!

1056
02:05:50,086 --> 02:05:54,006
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1057
02:06:46,976 --> 02:06:49,270
Paul Atreides is still alive.

1058
02:06:51,063 --> 02:06:52,690
He challenges my father.

1059
02:06:54,066 --> 02:06:55,777
You've never been on Arrakis.

1060
02:06:57,361 --> 02:06:59,238
It's quite impressive. You'll see.

1061
02:06:59,322 --> 02:07:00,782
Was this all upon your advice?

1062
02:07:00,865 --> 02:07:01,866
What?

1063
02:07:02,950 --> 02:07:05,953
Did you counsel my father to exterminate the Atreides?

1064
02:07:06,037 --> 02:07:07,079
Of course I did.

1065
02:07:07,163 --> 02:07:08,581
Why else would it have happened?

1066
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:11,751
You tried to sacrifice an entire bloodline.

1067
02:07:11,834 --> 02:07:13,920
And I was right to do it.

1068
02:07:14,086 --> 02:07:17,131
The Kwisatz Haderach is a form of power

1069
02:07:17,215 --> 02:07:19,467
that our world has not yet seen.

1070
02:07:19,884 --> 02:07:22,011
The ultimate power.

1071
02:07:22,428 --> 02:07:23,846
For 90 generations,

1072
02:07:23,930 --> 02:07:25,848
we have supervised House Atreides.

1073
02:07:25,932 --> 02:07:26,933
They were promising,

1074
02:07:27,016 --> 02:07:29,018
but they were becoming dangerously defiant.

1075
02:07:29,185 --> 02:07:31,395
Their bloodline had to be terminated.

1076
02:07:32,688 --> 02:07:34,941
That is why we have put many bloodlines at work.

1077
02:07:35,024 --> 02:07:36,067
Several prospects.

1078
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:37,652
But it's backfired.

1079
02:07:37,819 --> 02:07:39,320
Paul is alive.

1080
02:07:39,487 --> 02:07:41,197
And if he defeats Feyd-Rautha, my father...

1081
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:42,508
Your father will lose the throne,

1082
02:07:42,532 --> 02:07:43,533
no matter who prevails.

1083
02:07:45,701 --> 02:07:46,702
But there is one way

1084
02:07:46,786 --> 02:07:48,496
your family can remain in power,

1085
02:07:48,663 --> 02:07:49,956
and, through you,

1086
02:07:50,039 --> 02:07:51,999
the continuation of our stewardship.

1087
02:07:53,167 --> 02:07:54,919
One way.

1088
02:07:55,670 --> 02:07:56,754
Are you prepared?

1089
02:07:58,047 --> 02:07:59,566
You've been preparing me my whole life,

1090
02:07:59,590 --> 02:08:00,591
Reverend Mother.

1091
02:08:03,302 --> 02:08:05,012
You're heading North with the others?

1092
02:08:05,596 --> 02:08:07,098
I'm Fedaykin.

1093
02:08:07,181 --> 02:08:08,182
I follow my leaders.

1094
02:08:08,266 --> 02:08:09,626
If fighting goes North, I go North.

1095
02:08:10,434 --> 02:08:11,703
Paul didn't have a choice, Chani.

1096
02:08:11,727 --> 02:08:13,062
I won't be fighting for him.

1097
02:08:14,188 --> 02:08:15,481
I'm fighting for my people.

1098
02:08:19,485 --> 02:08:21,153
I came to wish you best of luck.

1099
02:08:22,572 --> 02:08:23,698
I'd wish you the same...

1100
02:08:25,992 --> 02:08:27,535
but it seems you've won your battle.

1101
02:08:50,850 --> 02:08:52,184
He took the bait.

1102
02:08:58,816 --> 02:09:00,776
Well, the Emperor's very obliging.

1103
02:09:01,944 --> 02:09:03,529
He's right on time.

1104
02:09:37,229 --> 02:09:38,589
What is he doing here?

1105
02:09:39,190 --> 02:09:41,025
I brought spice production under control.

1106
02:09:44,654 --> 02:09:45,655
What do we do?

1107
02:09:47,198 --> 02:09:49,867
Send messages to the Great Houses.

1108
02:09:50,034 --> 02:09:53,037
Tell them that Arrakis is under Sardaukar attack.

1109
02:09:54,330 --> 02:09:56,874
Tell them, their future hangs in the balance.

1110
02:10:24,151 --> 02:10:26,071
When the storm hits this ridge,

1111
02:10:26,737 --> 02:10:28,948
Gurney will open the way for you, Stilgar,

1112
02:10:29,115 --> 02:10:31,617
so you can enter the basin from the West

1113
02:10:31,784 --> 02:10:33,911
and distract their defense systems.

1114
02:10:34,412 --> 02:10:35,788
Chani, I want you and your Fedaykin

1115
02:10:35,871 --> 02:10:37,164
to then attack from the East,

1116
02:10:38,082 --> 02:10:40,042
inside the basin.

1117
02:10:40,209 --> 02:10:42,294
I'll strike from the North, head on,

1118
02:10:42,628 --> 02:10:44,505
with the Fundamentalist troops.

1119
02:10:44,672 --> 02:10:47,174
And I'll serve Arrakeen for dessert.

1120
02:10:47,341 --> 02:10:49,969
Remember, I need the Emperor alive.

1121
02:11:49,862 --> 02:11:50,863
Hmm.

1122
02:11:59,246 --> 02:12:00,247
Baron,

1123
02:12:01,457 --> 02:12:04,877
do you have any idea who this Muad'Dib could be?

1124
02:12:06,253 --> 02:12:08,255
Some fanatic, Your Majesty.

1125
02:12:08,422 --> 02:12:10,424
- That's all we know. - More. More.

1126
02:12:10,591 --> 02:12:12,343
- Give me more. - He's a madman.

1127
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:14,095
- Mad? - All Fremen are mad.

1128
02:12:17,014 --> 02:12:18,808
That's all you know?

1129
02:12:18,974 --> 02:12:20,226
Really?

1130
02:12:21,018 --> 02:12:22,258
Muad'Dib is dead.

1131
02:12:25,106 --> 02:12:28,025
Or, he went hiding in the southern storms,

1132
02:12:28,109 --> 02:12:29,485
which means the same thing.

1133
02:12:30,653 --> 02:12:31,904
Your Majesty,

1134
02:12:32,071 --> 02:12:33,405
the sandstorm that's approaching

1135
02:12:33,489 --> 02:12:35,282
threatens the integrity of our shields.

1136
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:37,952
We recommend going back into orbit.

1137
02:12:38,119 --> 02:12:40,159
Well, the mountains will protect us from most of it,

1138
02:12:41,372 --> 02:12:42,373
Your Majesty.

1139
02:12:44,208 --> 02:12:48,129
Baron, have you ever investigated

1140
02:12:48,295 --> 02:12:51,006
the south regions of Arrakis?

1141
02:12:51,841 --> 02:12:54,426
Well, the entire region is uninhabitable.

1142
02:12:54,510 --> 02:12:56,053
It's well known, your Majesty.

1143
02:12:57,179 --> 02:13:00,099
Your uninhabited South

1144
02:13:01,267 --> 02:13:03,769
exhibits evidence of human activity.

1145
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:06,120
I wasn't aware of this.

1146
02:13:06,939 --> 02:13:08,858
I swear to you, I wasn't aware of any of this.

1147
02:13:14,321 --> 02:13:15,781
Muad'Dib is alive.

1148
02:13:17,074 --> 02:13:18,409
I must find him.

1149
02:14:38,739 --> 02:14:40,032
Fire!

1150
02:15:19,989 --> 02:15:21,073
Sardaukar!

1151
02:15:21,156 --> 02:15:22,324
On guard!

1152
02:19:36,119 --> 02:19:37,204
Sardaukar!

1153
02:20:42,603 --> 02:20:43,979
Grandfather.

1154
02:21:06,293 --> 02:21:07,753
You die like an animal.

1155
02:21:38,992 --> 02:21:40,661
Muad'Dib.

1156
02:22:01,264 --> 02:22:02,391
Oh, Muad'Dib!

1157
02:22:02,474 --> 02:22:07,187
Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!

1158
02:23:09,499 --> 02:23:10,625
Rabban!

1159
02:23:21,845 --> 02:23:23,597
Look who's back from the dead.

1160
02:23:37,819 --> 02:23:41,656
For my Duke, and my friends.

1161
02:24:47,138 --> 02:24:48,181
Warships.

1162
02:24:50,600 --> 02:24:51,601
The Great Houses.

1163
02:24:53,186 --> 02:24:55,730
Gurney, it's time. Bring the prisoners.

1164
02:24:55,897 --> 02:24:56,898
My Lord.

1165
02:25:22,966 --> 02:25:24,259
This isn't over yet.

1166
02:25:30,181 --> 02:25:31,349
I want you to know...

1167
02:25:34,477 --> 02:25:36,521
I will love you as long as I breathe.

1168
02:25:48,783 --> 02:25:51,786
There is a massed armada in orbit.

1169
02:25:54,623 --> 02:25:57,208
You're facing a full invasion, Fremen.

1170
02:25:58,293 --> 02:25:59,461
How can you be so sure

1171
02:25:59,544 --> 02:26:01,755
the Great Houses are here for me?

1172
02:26:07,344 --> 02:26:09,638
They may be curious to hear my side of the story,

1173
02:26:09,721 --> 02:26:10,722
don't you think?

1174
02:26:11,765 --> 02:26:14,809
I am Paul Atreides, son of Leto Atreides,

1175
02:26:14,893 --> 02:26:16,436
Duke of Arrakis.

1176
02:26:18,021 --> 02:26:19,439
- Gurney. - My Lord.

1177
02:26:19,606 --> 02:26:21,441
Send a warning to all ships.

1178
02:26:21,608 --> 02:26:23,151
If the Great Houses attack,

1179
02:26:23,234 --> 02:26:26,029
our atomics will obliterate all spice fields.

1180
02:26:27,656 --> 02:26:29,032
You're out of your mind.

1181
02:26:29,199 --> 02:26:30,325
He's bluffing.

1182
02:26:30,742 --> 02:26:32,428
Consider what you're about to do, Paul Atreides.

1183
02:26:32,452 --> 02:26:33,692
Silence!

1184
02:26:37,207 --> 02:26:38,333
Abomination.

1185
02:26:42,462 --> 02:26:43,463
Message sent, my Lord.

1186
02:26:46,007 --> 02:26:48,343
As a servant of the Imperium,

1187
02:26:48,510 --> 02:26:49,761
you will bow at my feet.

1188
02:26:49,928 --> 02:26:51,096
Your feet?

1189
02:26:51,846 --> 02:26:53,974
You'll be lucky to keep your head.

1190
02:26:56,643 --> 02:26:58,728
I'll take the hand of your daughter.

1191
02:27:00,689 --> 02:27:02,774
She will remain safe.

1192
02:27:02,941 --> 02:27:05,318
And we will rule together over the Empire.

1193
02:27:14,828 --> 02:27:15,829
But you...

1194
02:27:19,165 --> 02:27:21,501
You have to answer for my father.

1195
02:27:28,341 --> 02:27:29,551
Do you know why

1196
02:27:31,261 --> 02:27:32,387
I killed him?

1197
02:27:33,388 --> 02:27:35,765
Because he was a man who believed

1198
02:27:35,849 --> 02:27:37,434
in the rules of the heart.

1199
02:27:38,768 --> 02:27:40,729
But the heart is not meant to rule.

1200
02:27:42,188 --> 02:27:43,857
In other words...

1201
02:27:45,734 --> 02:27:46,735
your father

1202
02:27:47,902 --> 02:27:49,446
was a weak man.

1203
02:27:58,371 --> 02:28:00,040
Stand

1204
02:28:00,206 --> 02:28:01,541
or choose your champion.

1205
02:28:04,169 --> 02:28:05,962
I am here, Atreides.

1206
02:28:08,423 --> 02:28:09,549
I need a blade.

1207
02:28:09,924 --> 02:28:11,301
Accept mine.

1208
02:28:23,354 --> 02:28:26,149
Do not stain your hands on this animal.

1209
02:28:26,316 --> 02:28:27,442
Let me deal with him.

1210
02:28:27,609 --> 02:28:29,444
It's my burden, Gurney.

1211
02:28:47,962 --> 02:28:50,173
Why does he take such risks?

1212
02:28:50,340 --> 02:28:53,426
Muad'Dib leads the way.

1213
02:29:16,741 --> 02:29:18,284
I'm happy to finally meet you,

1214
02:29:19,202 --> 02:29:20,203
cousin.

1215
02:29:21,371 --> 02:29:22,372
Cousin?

1216
02:29:23,456 --> 02:29:24,457
Is that right?

1217
02:29:26,084 --> 02:29:27,085
Well,

1218
02:29:29,087 --> 02:29:31,756
you wouldn't be the first relative I've killed.

1219
02:29:34,050 --> 02:29:36,928
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1220
02:29:42,225 --> 02:29:44,477
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1221
02:30:35,028 --> 02:30:36,029
She's your pet?

1222
02:30:52,962 --> 02:30:54,756
Any special attention

1223
02:30:55,632 --> 02:30:57,050
for the pet?

1224
02:32:22,969 --> 02:32:25,013
You fought well, Atreides.

1225
02:32:32,687 --> 02:32:34,314
- Lisan al-Gaib. - Lisan al-Gaib.

1226
02:32:34,397 --> 02:32:37,400
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1227
02:32:37,483 --> 02:32:40,903
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1228
02:33:29,118 --> 02:33:30,745
You should have believed.

1229
02:33:31,913 --> 02:33:33,581
You chose the wrong side.

1230
02:33:34,665 --> 02:33:36,417
Side?

1231
02:33:36,501 --> 02:33:38,086
You, of all people, should know.

1232
02:33:39,587 --> 02:33:41,255
There are no sides,

1233
02:33:42,590 --> 02:33:44,550
Reverend Mother.

1234
02:34:03,277 --> 02:34:04,570
The life debt has been paid.

1235
02:34:04,654 --> 02:34:05,655
Spare my father now

1236
02:34:05,738 --> 02:34:07,018
and I will be your willing bride.

1237
02:34:07,115 --> 02:34:08,408
The throne will be yours.

1238
02:35:40,875 --> 02:35:42,293
My Lord,

1239
02:35:42,460 --> 02:35:44,295
the Great Houses have answered.

1240
02:35:44,462 --> 02:35:46,506
They refuse to honor your ascendancy.

1241
02:35:48,049 --> 02:35:51,219
We await your orders, Lisan al-Gaib.

1242
02:36:00,311 --> 02:36:02,480
- Lead them to Paradise. - Lisan al-Gaib!

1243
02:36:02,563 --> 02:36:07,568
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1244
02:36:07,652 --> 02:36:10,571
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1245
02:36:18,913 --> 02:36:20,873
Lisan al-Gaib!

1246
02:36:20,957 --> 02:36:22,750
Lisan al-Gaib!

1247
02:36:22,833 --> 02:36:25,711
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

1248
02:36:33,427 --> 02:36:35,067
What is happening, Mother?

1249
02:36:37,014 --> 02:36:39,475
Your brother attacks the Great Houses.

1250
02:36:43,020 --> 02:36:45,231
The Holy War begins.
