00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:55,281
<i>He's fluent in Mandarin,</i>

166
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:59,243
<i>and his background</i>

167
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:04,623
<i>really spans
both cultures fairly evenly.</i>

168
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:09,170
<i>So he's a very unique actor</i>

169
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:11,422
<i>and I feel very lucky to have him.</i>

170
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,674
Most career wins
in all of NASCAR history?

171
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:15,426
Please get out of the car.

172
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,304
CALLAHAM: <i>Yeah, that code switching
the super important because</i>

173
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:21,849
<i>it's a theme that we wanted to cover</i>

174
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:25,519
<i>in the first Asian American-led
Marvel movie.</i>

175
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,605
<i>And obviously Shang-Chi</i>

176
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:30,858
<i>has to code switch in a way
that is a little more acute</i>

177
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,944
<i>than the average human being
whose father isn't a supervillain.</i>

178
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,531
<i>So it's great that
he was able to do that.</i>

179
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:38,949
I was getting picked on a lot,

180
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,035
for all the reasons
we all get picked on a lot.

181
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:43,120
Plus, I had just moved to the U.S...

182
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:45,456
CRETTON: <i>We keep trying to break us
many stereotypes</i>

183
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,168
<i>as possible in this movie,
one of which is...</i>

184
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:54,548
<i>Asian females,</i>

185
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:57,968
<i>there's sometimes a stereotype
that they're not good drivers.</i>

186
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:01,263
<i>So, in our movie,</i>

187
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:07,895
<i>Nora's character Katy
is the best driver in San Francisco.</i>

188
00:12:09,522 --> 00:12:12,900
<i>So one by one,
we're breaking those stereotypes.</i>

189
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:17,154
CALLAHAM: <i>Yeah, she might be
the best driver in the world.</i>

190
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:18,948
<i>- Honestly.</i>
- CRETTON: <i>Yes, probably.</i>

191
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,491
That's true. You were.

192
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,701
- What?
- I was just in the back seat.

193
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,037
- That's a part of the car.
- That's still a part of the car.

194
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:26,580
How have you never told me this story?

195
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:29,458
You know, before she was a lawyer,
your girl was pretty wild.

196
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:31,293
What happened?

197
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:34,088
I grew up.

198
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,215
What's that supposed to mean?

199
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,383
Yeah, what's that supposed to mean?

200
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:41,011
That maybe there's a point where you're
supposed to stop going on joyrides

201
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:43,514
and start thinking about
living up to your potential.

202
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,391
Please tell me you're kidding, Soo.

203
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:46,517
SOO: Look,

204
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,852
we're now living in a world

205
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:50,563
where at any moment
half the population can just disappear.

206
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,482
Life's too short and too fragile.

207
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,861
Katy, you're a valet driver
with an honors degree from Berkeley,

208
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,363
and Shaun can speak,
like, four languages.

209
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:01,490
CRETTON: <i>One of the things
that I actually</i>

210
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:05,744
<i>showed in my pitch to get this job</i>

211
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:10,666
<i>was a scene in a bar with four friends</i>

212
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:16,338
<i>talking in a bar and I just said,</i>

213
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:19,633
<i>"Just imagine this scene
with all Asian Americans."</i>

214
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:23,262
<i>And instantly, it becomes something</i>

215
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:26,515
<i>that we haven't really seen before
on screen.</i>

216
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,226
SHAUN: driving skills...
KATY: Soo can't even parallel park.

217
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,937
CRETTON:
<i>When I shot that scene on set,</i>

218
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,981
<i>it was really emotional for me.</i>

219
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,650
<i>There's not a ton of emotion
happening in the movie</i>

220
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:39,445
<i>besides people just having fun.
But I was...</i>

221
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,990
<i>I got really emotional 'cause I thought</i>

222
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:47,453
<i>these are my friends, this is my life.</i>

223
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,416
<i>And it's the first time I've ever
really seen it on film before.</i>

224
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:57,755
CALLAHAM: <i>Can you talk
about the song selection</i>

225
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,007
<i>in this karaoke sequence, Destin?</i>

226
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,217
(CRETTON CHUCKLES)

227
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,803
CALLAHAM: <i>Got</i> Old Town Road <i>in there.</i>

228
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,556
<i>I heard</i>
I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing, <i>right?</i>

229
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,142
CRETTON: <i>Yes. Yes.</i>
CALLAHAM: <i>Love that.</i>

230
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:12,520
CRETTON: <i>They were basically
all of my favourite</i>

231
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:16,815
<i>running tracks that I listen to
every time I go for a jog.</i>

232
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,612
CALLAHAM: <i>I was hoping
those were your karaoke jams.</i>

233
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:24,031
<i>Your personal karaoke jams.</i>

234
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:27,826
CRETTON: <i>Some of them are.
Some of them are</i>. (LAUGHS)

235
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,371
<i>We actually started with eight</i>

236
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,207
<i>and we went into the room with them</i>

237
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,752
<i>and we had a roaming camera
and let them go.</i>

238
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,379
<i>And we just chose the highlights</i>

239
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:41,131
<i>and put them in the movie
for your viewing pleasure.</i>

240
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,013
CALLAHAM: <i>Here's Katy's family,</i>

241
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:52,059
<i>which has become Shang-Chi's</i>

242
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:54,270
<i>adoptive family in America.</i>

243
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,063
<i>He's Shaun here, by the way.</i>

244
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:58,274
<i>He has not revealed his true name.</i>

245
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:03,028
<i>This was also really critical.</i>

246
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:06,407
<i>You talked about wanting to do
a version of this scene from day one.</i>

247
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,826
SHAUN:...Funyuns and cigarettes
back to the afterlife?

248
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,912
CRETTON: <i>Yeah,
I think for both Dave and I,</i>

249
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:16,458
<i>it was really important for us to see</i>

250
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:23,424
<i>an Asian American family
and how the generations interact.</i>

251
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:29,847
<i>How you can clearly see the influence</i>

252
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:35,686
<i>of American culture growing stronger
with each new generation,</i>

253
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:42,401
<i>and all of that not
only informs the character of Katy</i>

254
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:46,280
<i>but also informs Shang-Chi
and who he is.</i>

255
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:52,286
<i>There's also an underlying
emotional story</i>

256
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:54,997
<i>that's happening
from Shang-Chi's perspective.</i>

257
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,250
<i>And if you watch him
throughout this scene,</i>

258
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:04,048
<i>the way that it was edited
by Nat and Harry and Elizabeth,</i>

259
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:08,802
<i>our editors, was finding little moments</i>

260
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:13,098
<i>where Shang-Chi is clearly
looking at this family</i>

261
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,894
<i>and seeing what he misses,
what he longs for.</i>

262
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:23,275
<i>What he finds is empty in his life.</i>

263
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:26,362
<i>So it's a bit of a set-up
of what's to come.</i>

264
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,329
CALLAHAM: <i>So, this entire commentary</i>

265
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,331
<i>is going to turn into me talking about</i>

266
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:40,542
<i>how a huge percentage
of this finished film</i>

267
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:44,963
<i>is actually a lot of ideas
were there from day one.</i>

268
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:49,134
<i>Destin, on the very first time
we were in the room together,</i>

269
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:51,595
<i>I remember, you said that
you wanted to do a bus fight.</i>

270
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:55,474
<i>I don't know where that idea came from,
but here it is.</i>

271
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:58,477
CRETTON: (LAUGHS)
<i>It was actually like...</i>

272
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:05,526
<i>The idea of this sequence
was in my pitch.</i>

273
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:12,116
<i>One, I've never done an action sequence
in any movie before.</i>

274
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,201
<i>But I do know what I love,</i>

275
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:19,832
<i>are action sequences
that are crafted around</i>

276
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:24,002
<i>a unique location or unique scenario.</i>

277
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:30,050
<i>And as a what-if scenario in my pitch,</i>

278
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:34,346
<i>it was, rather than have
two people fighting,</i>

279
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:39,977
<i>what if a fight broke out
on a runaway bus in San Francisco,</i>

280
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,521
<i>zooming down a hill, that can't stop?</i>

281
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:47,985
<i>So the stakes are raised tenfold
because of that,</i>

282
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:54,950
<i>and then it turned into this
really fun sequence that...</i>

283
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,789
Holy shit.

284
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:02,916
Who are you?

285
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,713
CRETTON:
<i>I can't believe that that tiny idea</i>

286
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:10,424
<i>turned into this crazy fight.</i>

287
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,510
CALLAHAM: <i>It's great, though,
because at some point</i>

288
00:18:13,594 --> 00:18:15,596
<i>the accordion bus idea came into...</i>

289
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,431
<i>I don't remember where
that came from specifically.</i>

290
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:20,142
<i>But then once we realised
we're going to chop this bus in half</i>

291
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:26,982
<i>and that we had this man, Razor Fist,
who has a razor fist for an arm,</i>

292
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,778
<i>it all started...
Cutting the brake line, all these ideas</i>

293
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:33,030
<i>started to really fall together
pretty easily.</i>

294
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:39,828
CRETTON: <i>The one thing we wanted
for this fight was to introduce,</i>

295
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:46,627
<i>the Jackie Chan style</i>

296
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:51,840
<i>of fight sequences into this movie.</i>

297
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:57,471
<i>Very loosely inspired
by Jackie Chan movies,</i>

298
00:18:57,554 --> 00:19:01,308
<i>but also also loosely inspired
by Buster Keaton movies.</i>

299
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:06,897
<i>There's a lot of set-ups and payoffs,
a lot of physical gags in this.</i>

300
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,775
Every time I've tried to drive
a bus, I get yelled at.

301
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:16,281
CRETTON: <i>Our second-unit director,
Brad Allan,</i>

302
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:22,746
<i>one of his heroes is Buster Keaton
and I love the way that</i>

303
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,707
<i>these set-ups and payoffs
are sprinkled throughout.</i>

304
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:31,129
<i>So the story is all told
through physical gags</i>

305
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,506
<i>and movement.</i>

306
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:38,011
CALLAHAM: <i>Worth pointing out here,
the guy filming this,</i>

307
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,972
<i>he's called Klev in the script.</i>

308
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:42,808
<i>He is doing a live stream
that comes back later.</i>

309
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,310
<i>He's also in one
of the</i> Spider-Man <i>movies,</i>

310
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:48,814
<i>so he is now
a recurring character in the MCU.</i>

311
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,567
(ALL YELP)

312
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:07,374
CALLAHAM: <i>This is awesome.</i>

313
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:13,255
CRETTON: <i>This sequence
was primarily headed</i>

314
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:16,133
<i>by fight coordinator Andy Cheng.</i>

315
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:23,473
<i>He was in Jackie Chan's stunt team.</i>

316
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:29,646
<i>I mean, he has crazy stories
of doubling for Jackie Chan</i>

317
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,648
<i>on some of the craziest stunts</i>

318
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:36,820
<i>that we've seen in those movies.</i>

319
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:42,951
<i>So he was the perfect person
to create this really fun vibe</i>

320
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:45,662
<i>throughout this fight sequence.</i>

321
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:48,332
<i>This shot in particular</i>

322
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:54,755
<i>was very loosely inspired
by a pretty iconic shot from</i> Oldboy,

323
00:20:56,089 --> 00:21:01,470
<i>which is one of my favourite films
and we wanted to play</i>

324
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:08,060
<i>the climax of this fight sequence out
in a pretty simple oner</i>

325
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:11,229
<i>that comes out of the bus
and tracks with Shang-Chi</i>

326
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,774

<i>His design</i>

394

deep backstory expository scenes</i>

<i>which are very hard to write
without them starting to go on,</i>

<i>and sometimes the characters
are having these conversations</i>

422
00:27:16,761 --> 00:27:19,139
<i>in locations like this,
and it seems totally bonkers</i>

423
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:20,807
<i>that these two people
are having this conversation,</i>

424
00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:23,310
<i>and there's people sitting around
and whatnot.</i>

425
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:27,397
<i>So this seemed like a fun way
to have fun with that idea.</i>

426

<i>And it also allowed us to get to Macau,

<i>Shang-Chi, at one point, initially</i>

<i>was the son of a character
called Fu Manchu,</i>

stereotypical character</i>

760

<i>that was borrowed
from previous storytelling.</i>

761
00:48:54,182 --> 00:48:59,062

that character to the Mandarin.</i>

<i>and then eventually that character</i>

764
00:49:07,404 --> 00:49:09,990
<i>became a character
called Zhuang Zhou, I believe.</i>

765
00:49:10,073 --> 00:49:14,411
<i>But all of them were depicted in a way
that wasn't particularly helpful,</i>

766

<i>or it was always a bit problematic.</i>

767
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:19,082
<i>And so even when we knew</i>

768
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:21,752
<i>that we were going to be painting</i>

769
00:49:21,835 --> 00:49:24,463
<i>an entirely new picture
of this character...</i>

770
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:26,673
<i>He was going to be named Wenwu,</i>

771
00:49:26,757 --> 00:49:28,717
<i>he was going to be
a three-dimensional character</i>

772

<i>that had really
no relationship whatsoever</i>

<i>with those previous iterations.</i>

774
00:49:35,557 --> 00:49:38,060
<i>Part of the baggage that we inherited
was that he was still</i>

775
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:41,980
<i>the leader of The Ten Rings,
which meant inside of the MCU canon,</i>

776
00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:46,568
<i>in</i> Iron Man 3 <i>he had been
referred to as the Mandarin,</i>

777
00:49:46,652 --> 00:49:50,322
<i>which is a name that itself
is considered problematic</i>

778
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:53,950
<i>and is not particularly helpful
to any of us making this movie.</i>

779
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:56,536
<i>And so we had a lot of conversations,</i>

780
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:02,709
<i>Destin and I especially,
about how do we account for the stuff</i>

781

<i>that's been put before us,

782
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:09,508
<i>and come up with a storyline
that allows Wenwu to breathe</i>

783
00:50:09,591 --> 00:50:12,177
<i>as this three-dimensional character
and simultaneously</i>

784
00:50:12,886 --> 00:50:16,181
<i>establish why he would have been
called the Mandarin by certain people.</i>

785
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:20,602
<i>And what we ended up with
was a version where</i>

786
00:50:20,686 --> 00:50:23,480
<i>it's a name that
had been applied to him,</i>

787
00:50:23,563 --> 00:50:25,774
<i>but primarily by people who probably</i>

788
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:27,943
<i>didn't understand him,
or his culture as well.</i>

789
00:50:28,694 --> 00:50:30,487

790
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:33,073
<i>that he ever
would have chosen for himself.</i>

CRETTON: <i>When I was talking to Tony
about the character,</i>

792
00:50:39,871 --> 00:50:44,376
<i>the Wenwu character,
there was a moment on set</i>

793
00:50:45,419 --> 00:50:48,588
<i>when he told me...</i>

794
00:50:49,506 --> 00:50:52,592
<i>We started talking about whether</i>

795
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:56,722
<i>Wenwu has the ability</i>

796
00:50:56,805 --> 00:51:00,892
<i>to love, genuinely love his family</i>

797
00:51:02,644 --> 00:51:08,191
<i>and Tony emphatically said, "Yes."</i>

798
00:51:08,275 --> 00:51:10,861
<i>He said Wenwu</i>

799
00:51:11,153 --> 00:51:16,616
<i>genuinely, deeply loves
not only his wife but also his kids.</i>

800
00:51:18,744 --> 00:51:23,707
<i>But he said his problem
is he doesn't know how.</i>

801
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:27,961
<i>And when Tony told me that,</i>

802
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:31,965
<i>it's like this character
just clicked into place.</i>

803
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:36,970
<i>And when you watch Tony's
performance through that lens,</i>

804
00:51:37,053 --> 00:51:42,350
<i>it really makes so much sense,
that this man</i>

805
00:51:43,602 --> 00:51:47,272
<i>is not necessarily evil.</i>

806
00:51:47,355 --> 00:51:51,818
<i>He is lost and broken</i>

807
00:51:51,902 --> 00:51:56,281
<i>and doing things
that arguably are very evil.</i>

808
00:51:56,364 --> 00:52:01,036
<i>But I think the way Tony played him
is that</i>

809
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:05,248
<i>rooted in every evil deed</i>

810
00:52:05,332 --> 00:52:11,671
<i>is this pain that is a result
of a lost love.</i>

811
00:52:13,006 --> 00:52:15,926
CALLAHAM: <i>That's probably the thing that
differentiates this character the most</i>

812

<i>from anything that we've
ever seen in the comics as well.</i>

813

I really relate to Tony's Wenwu.</i>

CALLAHAM: <i>This sequence...</i>
CRETTON: <i>This is really cool.</i>

823
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:52,003
CALLAHAM: <i>This is awesome.
I don't know how you did it.</i>

824
00:52:53,046 --> 00:52:55,131
CRETTON: <i>I don't know how...</i>

825
00:52:55,215 --> 00:53:00,095
<i>This is Chris and his amazing team</i>

826
00:53:01,096 --> 00:53:05,100
<i>of visual effects artists
who are working</i>

827
00:53:05,183 --> 00:53:08,144
<i>on each of these moments.</i>

828
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:10,522
<i>I mean, they're scattered
throughout the world.</i>

829
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:13,233
<i>The number of people
who worked on these sequences</i>

830
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:15,569
<i>is mind-boggling</i>

831
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:21,116
<i>and this is one of the first
sequences that we worked on,</i>

832
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:24,911
<i>and it actually could have been</i>

833
00:53:24,995 --> 00:53:28,665
<i>a really lame, expository moment.</i>

834
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:32,294
<i>But it turned into something
that is really visually beautiful</i>

835
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:35,797
<i>and sets us up for a lot
of what's to come in the movie.</i>

836
00:53:36,506 --> 00:53:38,174
CALLAHAM: <i>I remember
that being really challenging</i>

837
00:53:38,258 --> 00:53:42,846
<i>because we knew that we're sticking
these pendants into the dragon's eyes</i>

838
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:45,599
<i>and that information
was going to be revealed.</i>

839
00:53:45,682 --> 00:53:47,267
<i>But the manner in which that information</i>

840
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:50,186
<i>would be revealed
was a real big question mark for us</i>

841
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,606
<i>for a long time
until those guys got involved.</i>

842
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:54,816
CRETTON: <i>Yeah,
because Chris, from the beginning,</i>

843
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,778
<i>because he's worked
on so many movies with...</i>

844
00:53:58,862 --> 00:54:03,783
<i>Chris was the VFX supervisor
for</i> Captain America,

845
00:54:04,784 --> 00:54:08,371
<i>and he has worked on
so many Marvel movies since.</i>

846
00:54:08,997 --> 00:54:13,335
<i>His one request from the beginning
for this moment was,</i>

847
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:17,589
<i>"Can we please not do a hologram?"</i>

848
00:54:21,301 --> 00:54:25,847
<i>And we could not figure out how else
to do this moment without a hologram</i>

849
00:54:25,972 --> 00:54:28,683
<i>until Chris came up with the idea,</i>

850
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:31,061
<i>"What if it was a water hologram?"</i>

851
00:54:31,144 --> 00:54:33,104
<i>And we said, "Great."</i> (CHUCKLES)

852
00:54:35,774 --> 00:54:39,319
<i>Well, this is a big turning point
in the movie where</i>

853
00:54:41,196 --> 00:54:44,449
<i>Wenwu realises
that his kids aren't going to be</i>

854
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:47,744
<i>coming on the ride with him,
or believe what he's doing,</i>

855
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:50,080
<i>and throws them in prison.</i>

856
00:54:50,538 --> 00:54:53,708
<i>It's also the first reveal
that we have that</i>

857
00:54:54,668 --> 00:54:59,214
<i>Wenwu truly believes that his wife is</i>

858
00:55:00,173 --> 00:55:02,968
<i>speaking to him and calling to him from</i>

859
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:05,637
<i>wherever she is trapped.</i>

860
00:55:07,764 --> 00:55:11,685
<i>Was that idea something that</i>

861
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:19,901
<i>we discovered in the edit or in
the shooting of... Do you know, Dave?</i>

862
00:55:20,902 --> 00:55:21,987
<i>Was that in the script?</i>

863
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:23,321
CALLAHAM: <i>That he was
hearing the actual voice?</i>

864
00:55:23,405 --> 00:55:28,410
<i>Yeah, we ended up with that
in the pages at some point because...</i>

865
00:55:29,452 --> 00:55:32,664
<i>The general idea of it
was always in place,</i>

866
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:35,458
<i>that he believed that his wife was...</i>

867
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,129
<i>He was capable of saving her
at some point,</i>

868
00:55:39,212 --> 00:55:40,630
<i>and that was always his motivation.</i>

869
00:55:40,714 --> 00:55:42,173
<i>The manner in which</i>

870
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:44,092
<i>that information was presented to him,</i>

871
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:45,969
<i>we went through
a lot of different iterations.</i>

872
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:48,888
<i>- Literally hearing a voice.</i>
- CRETTON: <i>Yeah.</i>

873
00:55:49,639 --> 00:55:51,891
CALLAHAM: <i>Imagining it,
not hearing a voice.</i>

874
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:58,356
CRETTON: <i>It was one of the challenges,
really getting into Wenwu's head</i>

875
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,860
<i>and what he really believes, and...</i>

876
00:56:05,113 --> 00:56:09,617
<i>It was one of the underlying</i>

877
00:56:13,496 --> 00:56:19,377
<i>metaphors of the movie
and are connected to The Ten Rings</i>

878
00:56:19,461 --> 00:56:21,337
<i>and what they represent</i>

879
00:56:23,506 --> 00:56:28,762
<i>and how they are connected to,
not only Wenwu's obsession with power,</i>

880
00:56:28,845 --> 00:56:31,139
<i>but also just his addiction.</i>

881
00:56:34,184 --> 00:56:37,145
<i>And how they act as a veil</i>

882
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:41,775
<i>that is keeping him from
really seeing the reality around him.</i>

883
00:56:45,028 --> 00:56:46,654
<i>Now we come to</i>

884
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:49,532
<i>a pretty big reveal of the movie.</i>

885
00:56:52,744 --> 00:56:53,745
CALLAHAM: <i>Here he is.</i>

886
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:55,413

"Oh, I would'st though could'st."

888
00:56:57,874 --> 00:56:58,875
CALLAHAM: <i>So this is...</i>

889
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:04,130
<i>Trevor Slattery, a character
that we first met in</i> Iron Man 3.

890
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:08,468
<i>He was initially presented
in the film as the Mandarin.</i>

891
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:15,558
<i>And then we learn, in a great twist,
that he is simply a oafish British actor</i>

892
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:19,437
<i>who has been hired
to portray the Mandarin.</i>

893
00:57:22,774 --> 00:57:25,985
<i>He obviously has an association with
The Ten Rings because of that movie,</i>

894
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:30,198
<i>and because of the great short</i>
All Hail the King

895
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:31,991
<i>that Drew Pearce
directed after that film,</i>

896
00:57:32,742 --> 00:57:36,079
<i>which showed Trevor in jail,
and eventually being broken out of jail,</i>

897
00:57:36,162 --> 00:57:40,125
<i>presumably by the person
whose identity he had stolen,</i>

898
00:57:40,208 --> 00:57:43,336
<i>which in this movie
is revealed to be Wenwu,</i>

899
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:45,505
<i>and that is why he is in a dungeon</i>

900
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:48,550
<i>- in this fortress.</i>

901
00:57:48,633 --> 00:57:51,052
CALLAHAM: <i>We knew we wanted to use him
if we could get him.</i>

902
00:57:51,845 --> 00:57:55,306
<i>Very early in the process,
right, Destin? He just seemed so fun.</i>

903
00:57:55,390 --> 00:58:00,937
CRETTON: <i>Yeah, and we actually did talk
to Drew about the direction</i>

904
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:05,233
<i>that we were taking the character
and we spoke to Sir Ben at length.</i>

905
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:08,903
<i>And Sir Ben really loved the idea</i>

906
00:58:09,612 --> 00:58:15,952
<i>of a Trevor who has
used his time behind bars</i>

907
00:58:16,411 --> 00:58:19,539
<i>and in a dungeon
to really turn his life around.</i>

908
00:58:19,831 --> 00:58:24,377
<i>And this is a version of Trevor who is</i>

909
00:58:25,587 --> 00:58:28,423
<i>extremely positive</i>

910
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:32,969
<i>and really enjoying life.</i>

911
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:39,100
CALLAHAM: <i>It looks like a Manchester
United scarf back there,</i>

912
00:58:39,184 --> 00:58:40,894
<i>which is interesting
since he's from Liverpool.</i>

913
00:58:40,977 --> 00:58:42,729
<i>So we should talk about Morris.</i>

(CRETTON LAUGHS)

915
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:45,815

<i>I mean, where do we start here?</i>

917
00:58:49,277 --> 00:58:52,447
<i>This was also something
that we talked about</i>

918
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:55,074
<i>before we ever even pitched Kevin
the final version</i>

919
00:58:55,158 --> 00:58:56,993
<i>of what we were going
to attempt to write.</i>

920
00:58:57,535 --> 00:59:00,955
<i>Should we talk about
the origin of Morris, Destin?</i>

921
00:59:01,289 --> 00:59:03,750
CRETTON: <i>Yes, I'm not sure...</i>

922
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:05,084

CRETTON: <i>I mean...</i>

923
00:59:05,168 --> 00:59:07,921

CRETTON: <i>Well, Morris.</i>

924
00:59:08,213 --> 00:59:09,797
<i>I mean, I think we should...</i>

925
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:12,800
<i>Morris was a loose...</i>

926
00:59:13,509 --> 00:59:17,847
<i>Was originated from a loose sketch
that was up on our wall.</i>

<i>Our mood board wall.</i>

928
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:29,567
<i>And we initially pitched the idea
up to Kevin</i>

929
00:59:30,151 --> 00:59:32,528
<i>of a six-legged creature</i>

930
00:59:33,154 --> 00:59:35,615
<i>with wings and no face.</i>

931
00:59:35,698 --> 00:59:38,993
<i>And we thought it would get
stomped on pretty quickly.</i>

932
00:59:39,744 --> 00:59:42,038
<i>But Kevin said go for it.</i>

933
00:59:42,163 --> 00:59:43,331
<i>And so we did.</i>

934
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:49,003
<i>And I think really early on,</i>

935
00:59:49,087 --> 00:59:54,259
<i>in the very beginning,

to the final cut of this movie,</i>

938

<i>Yeah. We...</i>

941
01:00:11,818 --> 01:00:14,404
<i>The picture that we had on the wall
was really ridiculous.</i>

942

<i>I remember, Destin...
The first day you walked into that room,</i>

943

948
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:29,919

<i>"I'll get a tattoo of it if it does."</i>

the story to Kevin</i>

952

<i>and I got to the point
where we're going to bring Morris,</i>

953
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:41,639

<i>Kevin, if he doesn't like stuff,
is still super polite about it</i>

<i>and he never really makes you feel bad
about your insane idea.</i>

it's very clear.</i>

1305

<i>Bill is a legend in his own right.</i>

1306

<i>for</i> The Matrix
<i>and the entire</i> Matrix <i>trilogy,</i>

1308

CRETTON: <i>This scene
in particular is really...</i>

1317
01:24:58,219 --> 01:25:02,348
<i>I think it's a great example of
what it's like to work with Bill Pope.</i>

1318
01:25:02,432 --> 01:25:09,189
<i>Because he is not only
looking for the coolest camera angle</i>

1319
01:25:11,107 --> 01:25:13,610
<i>or where to flaunt himself
in what he does.</i>

1320
01:25:13,693 --> 01:25:18,156
<i>He's always looking at it
from a character standpoint,</i>

1321
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:22,243
<i>and for this scene,
we were trying to figure out</i>

1322
01:25:22,577 --> 01:25:27,749
<i>how we could shoot this scene
differently than other fight sequences</i>

1323
01:25:27,832 --> 01:25:31,252
<i>And it was Bill
in a brainstorming session</i>

1324
01:25:31,336 --> 01:25:35,965
<i>that said, "How about
we never let the camera</i>

1325
01:25:36,049 --> 01:25:39,093
<i>"leave Shang-Chi's perspective?"</i>

1326
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:47,936
<i>So that the fight takes place completely
from the POV of young Shang-Chi.</i>

1327
01:25:48,603 --> 01:25:51,940
<i>We leave the fight as it's happening.</i>

1329

1330

<i>through young Shang-Chi's face
and performance.</i>

1331
01:26:06,788 --> 01:26:08,248
<i>It was really difficult to do.</i>

1332
01:26:08,331 --> 01:26:13,044
<i>It required a lot of
intricate collaboration</i>

1333
01:26:13,127 --> 01:26:15,964
<i>between Bill Pope
and what we were shooting</i>

1334

<i>and Chris Townsend</i>

1335
01:26:21,052 --> 01:26:25,431
<i>and quite a bit of VFX had to happen
in order to pull that shot off.</i>

1336
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:30,311
<i>But I really, really love
how it turned out.</i>

1337
01:26:30,395 --> 01:26:33,815

1338

<i>to the dark side of Shang-Chi's past</i>

1339

1513
01:39:27,254 --> 01:39:30,049
CRETTON: <i>All of this started
as an experiment.</i>

1514
01:39:30,132 --> 01:39:35,387
<i>We initially wanted to shoot Shang-Chi
in a pool underwater.</i>

1515
01:39:36,764 --> 01:39:39,391
<i>But we knew it would just...</i>

1516
01:39:39,475 --> 01:39:44,021
<i>We didn't really have the time,
and it would be a real pain</i>

1517
01:39:44,146 --> 01:39:47,733
<i>because Simu would have
to hold his breath for a long time.</i>

1518
01:39:48,108 --> 01:39:51,487
<i>So it started as an experiment where</i>

1519
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:56,075
<i>we put him on a harness</i>

1520
01:39:56,158 --> 01:40:01,038
<i>and shot him
in extra slow-mo on a stage,</i>

1521
01:40:02,122 --> 01:40:05,584
<i>and Bill and Reg did some
really incredible lighting</i>

1522
01:40:05,668 --> 01:40:09,630
<i>that made it feel like we're underwater
and we shot it at a really high speed.</i>

1523
01:40:09,755 --> 01:40:15,094
<i>So, he was in extra slow-mo,
blew wind on him,</i>

1524
01:40:15,177 --> 01:40:19,682
<i>and we tried it as a test
to see if it could look like</i>

1525
01:40:19,765 --> 01:40:22,810
<i>it was actually shot underwater.</i>

1526
01:40:24,728 --> 01:40:25,979
<i>And it looked really good.</i>

1527
01:40:26,063 --> 01:40:28,357
<i>So that's how we ended up
shooting the entire thing.</i>

1528
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:31,652
<i>So all of this,
all that lighting right there was...</i>

1529
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:39,785
<i>Reg had this rig that he put
above Shang-Chi, above Simu,</i>

1530
01:40:40,619 --> 01:40:46,375
<i>and it was actual...
Like, basically an aquarium of water</i>

1531
01:40:46,917 --> 01:40:50,504
<i>that light was shining
through onto Simu.</i>

1533

1534
01:40:56,552 --> 01:40:59,596
<i>were actual reflections from real water.</i>

1535
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:03,976
CALLAHAM: <i>And then, the bubbles
and the water effects were</i>

with character development</i>

1555

<i>in a VFX process,
how much back and forth</i>

1556

<i>and meticulous notes it takes
to get to a place.</i>

1557

on that dragon?</i>

so much moss on that dragon</i>

<i>that the actors
can get in and out of them,</i>

<i>The way that the flashback
turned out in the final cut of the movie</i>

<i>of the movie was actually something that</i>

1608
01:45:29,908 --> 01:45:33,453
<i>was pushed to a certain extent
in the scriptwriting phase,</i>

1609

in the editing phase.</i>

<i>the plan to have callbacks
to the flashbacks with Shang-Chi</i>

<i>when he's underwater with the dragon.</i>

1613
01:45:53,015 --> 01:45:57,352

being introduced</i>

<i>in the scriptwriting phase,</i>

1615
01:46:00,230 --> 01:46:02,482
<i>we were able to play with it even more</i>

1616
01:46:04,401 --> 01:46:08,196
<i>and tease out the flashbacks
throughout the movie</i>

1617
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:11,283
<i>so they almost became
a parallel storyline</i>

1790

<i>I love that. I love the way</i>

1793
01:58:21,512 --> 01:58:23,473

<i>like a shark,

1818

<i>And he's looking at the props</i>

1819
01:59:44,011 --> 01:59:47,640
<i>and he felt the weight of
each of their chairs</i>

1820
01:59:47,723 --> 01:59:50,476
<i>and was like, "Okay,
I know what I'm going to do."</i>

<i>But he waits for the take,</i>

1822

1824

1828

CALLAHAM: <i>Had he been told to
pound that drink, or did he do that?</i>

1829
02:00:18,421 --> 02:00:20,214

<i>Where did the idea for this come from?</i>

1838
02:00:43,696 --> 02:00:48,034
CRETTON: <i>The ideas for these credits
came from the theme of the movie,</i>

1839
02:00:48,117 --> 02:00:52,121
<i>which was rooted in the spirit of Mom,</i>

1840
02:00:52,204 --> 02:00:56,125
<i>and Mom's spirit is rooted in water.</i>

1841
02:00:56,208 --> 02:01:01,839
<i>So we talked to Perception,
who did our credits,</i>

1842
02:01:01,923 --> 02:01:05,176
<i>and we talked to them
about what we could do</i>

1843
02:01:05,259 --> 02:01:08,804
<i>with animating water
that we haven't really seen before.</i>

1844
02:01:09,472 --> 02:01:12,224
<i>And really loved what they pitched us,</i>

1845
02:01:12,308 --> 02:01:14,769
<i>- and this is where we landed.</i>
- CALLAHAM: <i>That's really neat.</i>

1846
02:01:14,852 --> 02:01:17,855
<i>There's like a gentleness to it</i>

1847
02:01:17,939 --> 02:01:21,901
<i>because the music is soft in a way.</i>

1848
02:01:21,984 --> 02:01:24,195
CRETTON: <i>I mean, I love the song.</i>

1849
02:01:24,278 --> 02:01:27,365
<i>I love the song
that plays over the end credits.</i>

1850
02:01:27,490 --> 02:01:32,411
<i>It's an Anderson.Paak song,
who's one of my favourite artists,</i>

1851
02:01:32,536 --> 02:01:36,582
<i>and it's a song he hasn't released yet,</i>

1852
02:01:36,791 --> 02:01:39,585
<i>or will be releasing
with the album of our movie.</i>

1853
02:01:40,044 --> 02:01:43,714
<i>And I heard an early draft of the song</i>

1854
02:01:43,798 --> 02:01:45,466
<i>and just fell in love with it,</i>

1855
02:01:46,384 --> 02:01:49,887
<i>so I'm so happy that it's in
the end of our movie.</i>

1856
02:01:51,806 --> 02:01:53,349

From the beginning,</i>

<i>we knew that we wanted
to keep the legend</i>

<i>of The Ten Rings alive
at the end of our movie.</i>

1862
02:02:12,952 --> 02:02:16,706
<i>So we wanted to end this movie</i>

1863
02:02:17,373 --> 02:02:24,296
<i>with a clear question
that we know will be answered</i>

1864

<i>at some point in the future.</i>

1865
02:02:26,465 --> 02:02:28,467

Who are they talking to?</i>

1867
02:02:32,596 --> 02:02:36,350

- CALLAHAM: <i>In the comics,</i>

1868
02:02:36,475 --> 02:02:41,689
<i>the finger rings come from a spaceship.</i>

1869
02:02:43,274 --> 02:02:47,194
<i>And I do you remember talking a lot
about what we wanted to reveal,</i>

1870
02:02:47,278 --> 02:02:50,906
<i>and whether we were going to keep
any element of that origin story or not.</i>

1871
02:02:50,990 --> 02:02:54,160
<i>And we had the freedom
to do what we wanted to do,</i>

1872
02:02:54,243 --> 02:02:55,745
<i>because we were changing the rings.</i>

1873
02:02:55,828 --> 02:02:58,289
<i>But we had written a lot of versions</i>

1874
02:02:58,372 --> 02:03:02,334
<i>of how Wenwu came upon them,
where did he get them?</i>

1875
02:03:02,418 --> 02:03:07,048
<i>And they were always designed
to be intentionally nebulous,</i>

1876
02:03:07,131 --> 02:03:09,550
<i>so that this could happen.</i>

1877

that this character was</i>

1940
02:06:30,584 --> 02:06:33,420
<i>going to be introduced to the MCU.</i>

1941
02:06:34,296 --> 02:06:40,261
<i>And it was...
I don't know, something sparked.</i>

1942
02:06:40,678 --> 02:06:45,099
<i>And it wasn't an obvious
"I have to do this movie, "</i>

1943
02:06:45,182 --> 02:06:50,396
<i>but it was a "I really have to be
part of this conversation."</i>

1944
02:06:50,854 --> 02:06:54,650
<i>And coming in to talk
to Jonathan Schwartz,</i>

1945
02:06:54,733 --> 02:06:59,196
<i>our producer, really got me excited</i>

1946
02:06:59,530 --> 02:07:01,949
<i>that they were taking
the character seriously,</i>

1947
02:07:02,032 --> 02:07:05,536
<i>and that they were wanting
to do something</i>

1948
02:07:05,619 --> 02:07:10,040
<i>that was really special
and significant and respectful</i>

1949
02:07:10,124 --> 02:07:12,960
<i>to the Asian
and Asian American community.</i>

1950
02:07:15,254 --> 02:07:16,839
<i>And then hearing that, Dave,</i>

1951
02:07:16,922 --> 02:07:20,134
<i>you were on the project,
connected to the project,</i>

1952
02:07:20,259 --> 02:07:24,430
<i>was also really exciting to me.</i>

1953

CALLAHAM: <i>I felt the same way. I love...</i>

1954

1955

at this point, but I just...</i>

1956
02:07:33,605 --> 02:07:35,274
<i>It just makes everything a lot more fun</i>

1957
02:07:36,859 --> 02:07:38,819
<i>and I was very eager for them to</i>

1958
02:07:39,653 --> 02:07:42,698
<i>bring me a director
that I could spitball with,</i>

1959
02:07:42,781 --> 02:07:46,660
<i>and I was a little bit alone
in the room with Jonathan,</i>

1960
02:07:46,744 --> 02:07:49,288
<i>and we were both smashing our heads
against the wall quite a bit</i>

1961
02:07:49,371 --> 02:07:50,372
<i>before you came in,</i>

1962
02:07:50,456 --> 02:07:54,251

1966

<i>to help make that a reality.</i>

1967
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:11,018
<i>And I felt the same way
that you did, by the way,</i>

1968
02:08:11,143 --> 02:08:13,103
<i>when they first talked to me
about this project.</i>

1969
02:08:13,187 --> 02:08:14,480
<i>I was really nervous.</i>

1970
02:08:14,563 --> 02:08:19,610
<i>I was like, "Oh, boy, I want to do it
but I don't want to mess it up, "</i>

1971
02:08:19,693 --> 02:08:22,696

was stronger for quite some time.</i>

1979

<i>before he was able to see this movie,</i>

1980
02:09:05,739 --> 02:09:11,286

<i>not only in the choreography
and the fight sequences,</i>

1983

in the room were vital to</i>

1985

<i>It was... It's still really,</i>

1989

<i>really hard to even process</i>

1990
02:10:00,669 --> 02:10:03,088
