1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:57,390
{Y:i}Before time began, there was the Cube.

3
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,060
{Y:i}We know not where it comes from,

4
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:06,399
{Y:i}only that it holds the power to create worlds and fill them with life.

5
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,986
{Y:i}That is how our race was born.

6
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,572
{Y:i}For a time, we lived in harmony,

7
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:19,245
{Y:i}but like all great power, some wanted it for good, others for evil.

8
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:22,457
{Y:i}And so began the war,

9
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:27,587
{Y:i}a war that ravaged our planet until it was consumed by death,

10
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:32,842
{Y:i}and the Cube was lost to the far reaches of space.

11
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:39,265
{Y:i}We scattered across the galaxy, hoping to find it and rebuild our home,

12
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:43,853
{Y:i}searching every star, every world.

13
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:50,318
{Y:i}And just when all hope seemed lost, message of a new discovery drew us

14
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:54,864
{Y:i}to an unknown planet called Earth.

15
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,165
{Y:i}But we were already too late.

16
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,681
Oh, God, five months of this.

17
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,267
I can't wait to get a little taste of home.

18
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,436
{Y:i}A plate of mama's alligators étouffée.

19
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,688
You've been talking about barbecued 'gators and crickets

20
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,983
for the last two weeks. I'm never going to your mama's house, Fig. I promise.

21
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,361
But Bobby, Bobby, 'gators are known to have the most succulent meat.

22
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,529
I understand.

23
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,410
English, please. English.

24
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:44,205
I mean, how many times have we... We don't speak Spanish. I told you that.

25
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,499
Why you got to ruin it for me, man? That's my heritage.

26
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,545
Go with the Spanish. Whatever.

27
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,675
Hey, you guys remember weekends? Huh? The Sox at Fenway.

28
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,470
- Cold hotdog and a flat beer. - Perfect day.

29
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,515
What about you, Captain? You got a perfect day?

30
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,685
I just can't wait to hold my baby girl for the first time.

31
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,270
- He's adorable. - That's too...

32
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,355
Shut up!

33
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,250
Hey, I'm ready to do this.

34
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,253
Hey, any of y'all grow some balls, come see me on the court, man.

35
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,463
Hey, hey!

36
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:37,759
Watch this crossover, baby.

37
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,054
Like Jordan in his prime, pushing through the front line.

38
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,057
- Step aside, ladies. - Oh, man. What?

39
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,393
- Lennox! - Hey, what are you doing?

40
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,104
- Water? - Thank you.

41
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,772
Are you gonna help me with the gear?

42
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:02,242
Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound unidentified infiltrator, 10 miles out.

43
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:11,501
{Y:i}Unidentified aircraft, you are in restricted US military airspace.

44
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,421
Squawk ident and proceed east out of the area.

45
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:20,343
Raptors one and two, snap to heading two-five-zero to intercept.

46
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,263
Bogie is in the weeds ten miles out, not squawking.

47
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:32,939
Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you to US SOCCENT airbase.

48
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:36,151
If you do not comply, we will use deadly force.

49
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,487
Copy the bogie.

50
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,115
{Y:i}Tail 4500 X-ray.

51
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,701
Sir, says here 4500 X was shot down three months ago.

52
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,619
- Afghanistan. - That's got to be a mistake.

53
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,788
- Check again, then recheck. - I did, sir.

54
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,874
A friend of mine was on that chopper.

55
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,462
{Y:i}Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you to US SOCCENT airbase.

56
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,925
- Radar, where's the inbound? - Bogie's five miles out, sir.

57
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,139
- My wife on? - Yes, Captain.

58
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,143
{Y:i}- My ladies! - Look.

59
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,270
Oh, my goodness. Look at her. She's getting so big.

60
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:15,482
{Y:i}Look at those cheeks. I just wanna chew on them.

61
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,317
{Y:i}Baby, we made a good-looking kid.

62
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,569
I know that people say that all the time,

63
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,030
but, wow, we made one good-looking kid. Nice work.

64
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,907
She has your laugh.

65
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,618
{Y:i}- She laughed? - Her first one, yeah.

66
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,662
{Y:i}You sure she didn't just fart?

67
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,539
No, she's a lady.

68
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,125
She doesn't know you yet, but she will.

69
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,546
4500 X. Something's not right.

70
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,303
{Y:i}Bogie's on the deck.

71
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,515
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Radar's jammed.

72
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,893
It's coming from the chopper.

73
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,562
{Y:i}- Will? - Sarah?

74
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:58,066
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me, I love you and I'll be home soon.

75
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:58,525
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me, I love you and I'll be home soon.

76
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,197
- To the right. Go to the right. - Check fire.

77
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,287
MH-53 pilot, power down now.

78
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,669
Have your crew step out or we will kill you.

79
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,514
Hold your fire! Stand by to engage!

80
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,731
My God.

81
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:58,043
They bombed the antenna farm! We're under attack!

82
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,239
Go! Move! Move!

83
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,873
It's going after the files!

84
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,333
Cut the hard lines!

85
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,377
I need a key! It's locked!

86
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,922
Move! Move!

87
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,638
Here, come here! Come here!

88
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,655
Here, hide in here!

89
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,865
Oh, my God. Okay.

90
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,535
No!

91
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,329
Oh!

92
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,133
What the...

93
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,852
Epps, let's go!

94
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,291
Okay, Mr. Witwicky, you're up.

95
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,044
Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.

96
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,337
Watch.

97
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,421
Okay.

98
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,132
For my family...

99
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:13,678
Who did... Who did that? People! Responsibility.

100
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:17,932
Okay.

101
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,061
So, for my family genealogy report,

102
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:24,314
I decided to do it on my great-great-grandfather,

103
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,650
who was a famous man, Captain Archibald Witwicky.

104
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,152
Very famous explorer.

105
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:35,700
In fact, he was one of the first to explore the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.

106
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:42,999
{Y:i}In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors straight into the Arctic Shelf.

107
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:48,088
Move faster, men! Move! Chop! Heave!

108
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:53,593
The ice is freezing faster than it's melting! Chop faster! Heave, men!

109
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:58,556
Heave! No sacrifice, no victory!

110
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,059
We'll get to the Arctic Circle, lads!

111
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,270
So that's the story, right?

112
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,564
And here we have some of the basic instruments and tools

113
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,483
used by 19th-century seamen.

114
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,820
This here is the quadrant, which you can get for 80 bucks.

115
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,196
It's all for sale, by the way.

116
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:17,992
Like the sextant here. $50 for this, which is a bargain.

117
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,578
These are pretty cool. These are my grandfather's glasses.

118
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,415
I haven't quite gotten them appraised yet, but they've seen many cool things.

119
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,750
Are you going to sell me his liver?

120
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,461
Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell. It's the 11th grade.

121
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,629
I don't think your grandfather would be

122
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,964
particularly proud of what you're doing.

123
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:34,300
I know. I'm sorry. I just, you know, this is all going towards my car fund.

124
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,469
You can tell your folks. It's on eBay. I take PayPal.

125
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,929
Cold hard cash works, too.

126
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,306
And the compass makes a great gift for Columbus Day.

127
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:41,766
- Sam! - Sorry.

128
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,685
Unfortunately, my great-great-grandfather,

129
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:48,648
the genius that he was, wound up going blind and crazy in a psycho ward,

130
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:49,899
drawing these strange symbols

131
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,485
and babbling on about some giant ice man

132
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,237
that he thought he'd discovered.

133
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:58,158
Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow. Might not.

134
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,577
- Sleep in fear tonight. - Here, you want? Here, 50. 40? 30?

135
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,996
- Sam? - Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

136
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,665
Okay. Pretty good, right?

137
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,003
I'd say a solid B-.

138
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:12,714
A B-?

139
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,841
You were hawking your great-grandfather's crap

140
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,134
- in my classroom. - No, kids enjoy...

141
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,469
- Look, can you do me a favor? - What?

142
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,888
Can you look out the window for a second? You see my father?

143
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,556
- He's the guy in the green car. - Yeah.

144
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,309
Okay, I wanna tell you about a dream. A boy's dream.

145
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,186
And a man's promise to that boy.

146
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,105
He looked at me in the eye. He said, "Son, I'm gonna buy you a car.

147
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,483
"But I want you to bring me $2,000 and three As."

148
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,693
Okay? I got the 2,000 and I got two As.

149
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:37,864
Okay? Here's the dream. Your B-. Dream gone. Kaput.

150
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,786
Sir, just ask yourself, what would Jesus do?

151
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,538
Yes! Yes, yes.

152
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,041
So?

153
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,334
A-. It's an A, though.

154
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,211
Wait, wait, wait. I can't see. It's an A.

155
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,004
- So I'm good? - You're good.

156
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:57,008
- I got a little surprise for you, son. - What kind of...

157
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,344
Yeah, a little surprise.

158
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,973
No. No, no, no, no. Dad!

159
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,434
- Oh, you got to be kidding me. - See?

160
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,479
Yeah. I am. You're not getting a Porsche.

161
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,859
- You think that's funny? - Yeah, I think it's funny.

162
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,444
- What's wrong with you? - You think I'd really get you

163
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,197
a Porsche for your first car?

164
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,491
I don't want to talk to you for the rest of this whole thing.

165
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:25,078
- Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke. - It's not a funny joke.

166
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,708
- Manny! - What?

167
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,252
Get your cousin out of that damn clown suit.

168
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,461
He's having a heat stroke again.

169
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,629
Scaring white folks.

170
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,631
I'm hot! Makeup's melting. It hurts my eyes.

171
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,093
Here? No, no, no, what is this? You said... You said half a car,

172
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,720
not half a piece of crap, Dad.

173
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,222
When I was your age, I'd have been happy with four wheels and an engine.

174
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,807
Okay, let me explain something to you. Okay?

175
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,225
{Y:i}- You ever see 40-Year-Old Virgin? - Yeah.

176
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,437
Okay, that's what this is. And this is 50-year-old virgin.

177
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,272
- Okay. - You want me to live that life?

178
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:54,607
- No sacrifice, no victory. - Yeah, no victory. You know, I got it.

179
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,942
- The old Witwicky motto, Dad. - Right.

180
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,110
Gentlemen.

181
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,990
Bobby Bolivia, like the country, except without the runs.

182
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,199
How can I help you?

183
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,077
Well, my son here, looking to buy his first car.

184
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,080
- You come to see me? - I had to.

185
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:13,543
That practically makes us family. Uncle Bobby B, baby. Uncle Bobby B.

186
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,004
- Sam. - Sam, let me talk to you.

187
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:20,967
Sam, your first enchilada of freedom awaits underneath one of those hoods.

188
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,096
Let me tell you something, son. A driver don't pick the car.

189
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,140
The car'll pick the driver.

190
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,018
It's a mystical bond between man and machine.

191
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,021
Son, I'm a lot of things, but a liar's not one of them.

192
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:37,650
Especially not in front of my mammy. That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy!

193
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,447
Don't be like that. If I had a rock, I'd bust your head, bitch.

194
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,616
I tell you, man, she deaf, you know?

195
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:52,248
Well, over here, every piece of car a man might want or need.

196
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,792
This ain't bad.

197
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,128
- This one's got racing stripes. - Yeah.

198
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:58,546
It got racing...

199
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,049
Yeah, what's this? What the heck is this?

200
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,926
I don't know nothing about this car.

201
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,260
- Manny! - What?

202
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,971
What is this? This car! Check it out!

203
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,557
{Y:i}I don't know, boss! I've never seen it! That's loco!

204
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,143
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny! Find out!

205
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,812
Feels good.

206
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,358
- How much? - Well,

207
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:23,363
considering the semi-classic nature of the vehicle,

208
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,240
with the slick wheels and the custom paint job...

209
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:29,411
- Yeah, but the paint's faded. - Yeah, but it's custom.

210
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,537
It's custom faded?

211
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,415
Well, this is your first car. I wouldn't expect you to understand.

212
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,334
- Five grand. - No, I'm not paying over four. Sorry.

213
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,336
Kid, come on, get out. Get out the car.

214
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,005
No, no, no. You said cars pick their drivers.

215
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:43,299
Well, sometimes they pick a driver with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.

216
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:46,553
Now, this one here for four Gs is a beaut.

217
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,805
There's a Fiesta with racing stripes over there.

218
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,516
No, I don't want a Fiesta with racing stripes.

219
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,643
This is a classic engine right here.

220
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:56,062
I sold a car the other day...

221
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,566
Gee. Holy cow.

222
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,067
- No, no, no. No worries. - You all right?

223
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:04,946
I'll get a sledgehammer and knock this right out. Hey, hey, Manny!

224
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,740
Get your clown cousin and get some hammers

225
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,950
and come bang this stuff out, baby!

226
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:10,994
{Y:i}... greater than man...

227
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:14,205
That one's my favorite, drove all the way from Alabammy.

228
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,432
$4,000.

229
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,237
Steve.

230
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,239
Hello, Mr. Secretary.

231
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,826
They're so young.

232
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,079
They're the top subject matter experts, sir.

233
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,456
NSA's recruiting right out of high school these days.

234
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,918
Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense.

235
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,004
I am so underdressed.

236
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,091
Ladies and gentlemen, the Secretary of Defense.

237
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,636
Please be seated.

238
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,681
I'm John Keller.

239
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:16,059
Obviously, you're wondering why you're here, so these are the facts.

240
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,312
{Y:i}At 1900 local time yesterday,

241
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:22,649
{Y:i}the SOCCENT Forward Operations Base in Qatar was attacked.

242
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:26,111
So far as we know, there were no survivors.

243
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,823
The objective of the attack was to hack our military network.

244
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,033
We're not sure exactly what they're after,

245
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,578
but we do know that they were cut off during the assault,

246
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:39,541
which would lead us to assume that they're going to try it again.

247
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,961
Now, no one's taken responsibility for the attack.

248
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:47,048
And the only real lead we have so far is this sound.

249
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,349
That's the signal that hacked our network.

250
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,895
NSA's working at full capacity to analyze it

251
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,480
and intercept further communications,

252
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,358
but we need your help to find out who did this.

253
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:09,696
Now, you've all shown considerable ability in the area of signals analysis.

254
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,365
We're on a hair-trigger here, people.

255
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,076
The President has dispatched battle groups

256
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:19,372
{Y:i}to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea. This is as real as it's ever gonna get.

257
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,082
{Y:i}Now I'm gonna leave you to your officer-in-charge.

258
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:24,085
You'll break up into teams and you'll start your work.

259
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,712
Good luck to us all.

260
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,600
All right, Mojo. I got the car. Now I need the girl.

261
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:44,314
I need money to take out the girl is what I need.

262
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,523
Zero bids.

263
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,319
Great. Broke.

264
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,780
Come on, Mojo. You want your pain pills?

265
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,075
No. Premature.

266
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,534
Good. What's up?

267
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:59,454
Nothing. You know, just driving my car. Driving my car.

268
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,957
It's like clockwork.

269
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,668
All right, I know you get wasted on these things,

270
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,837
but if you piss in my bed again, you're sleeping outside. Okay?

271
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,256
That's it for today. No more. Crackhead.

272
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,427
- Ron, this one is uneven. - Yeah. Probably.

273
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:15,762
This one is wobbly.

274
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:19,933
- Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon. - Couldn't we have hired a professional?

275
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,184
- Sam... - What?

276
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,853
I do not like footprints on my grass.

277
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,147
- What foot... There's no footprints. - That's why I built my path.

278
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,941
So why don't you go from my grass onto my path, okay?

279
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,193
- It's family grass, Dad. - Well, when you own your own grass,

280
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,404
- you'll understand. - This... I can't do it anymore.

281
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,614
- You're putting girl jewelry on a boy dog. - What?

282
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,866
He's got enough self-esteem issues as a Chihuahua, Mom.

283
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,535
That's his bling.

284
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,829
I want you home at 11:00!

285
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,789
- Yeah, all right. - 11:00!

286
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,041
Please, for the love of God, drive safely.

287
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,376
Seat belt on!

288
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,344
Wow. You are so cheap.

289
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,473
Well, it's his first car. Supposed to be like that.

290
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:10,859
{Y:i}At this time, we can't confirm whether there were any survivors.

291
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,360
Oh, my God.

292
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,320
{Y:i}Our bases worldwide are, as of now, at DEFCON Delta,

293
00:19:14,404 --> 00:19:16,531
{Y:i}our highest readiness level.

294
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:19,576
We're dealing with a very effective weapons system

295
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:22,037
that we have not come across before.

296
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:25,165
{Y:i}But our prayers are with the families of the brave men and women...

297
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,125
Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.

298
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,962
I've never seen a weapons system like this.

299
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:33,923
The thermal shows this weird aura around the exoskeleton

300
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:37,135
like it's cloaked by some kind of invisible force field.

301
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,512
That's impossible. There's no such thing as invisible force fields

302
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,806
except in, like, comic book stuff, right?

303
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,183
- Man, I don't know. - What is that?

304
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,477
My mama, she had the gift, you know?

305
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,563
She saw things. I got the gene, too,

306
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:52,609
and that thing that attacked us? I got a feeling it ain't over.

307
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,195
How about you use those magic voodoo powers

308
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,905
and get us the hell out of here, huh?

309
00:19:57,072 --> 00:20:01,368
When I took that picture, I think it saw me.

310
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,372
It looked right at me.

311
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,375
All right, we got to get this thing back to the Pentagon right away.

312
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,876
They got to know what we're dealing with here.

313
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,336
{Y:i}My radio's fried.

314
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,422
{Y:i}- I got no communication with aerial. - Hey, Mahfouz.

315
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,509
- How far do you live from here? - Not far. Just up that mountain.

316
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,135
- Do they have a phone? - Yes.

317
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,887
All right, let's hit it.

318
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,685
Dude, are you sure we're invited to this party?

319
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:30,647
Of course, Miles. It's a lake. Public property.

320
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:33,566
Oh, my God.

321
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,237
Oh, my God, dude, Mikaela's here. Just don't do anything weird, all right?

322
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,863
- I'm good, right? - Yeah, you're good.

323
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:39,948
Okay.

324
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,621
Hey, guys, check it out.

325
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:48,123
Oh, hi.

326
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:52,293
Hey, bro. That car. It's nice. Hey.

327
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,509
So, what are you guys doing here?

328
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,095
We're here to climb this tree.

329
00:21:02,846 --> 00:21:04,723
I see that. It looks... It looks fun.

330
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:06,266
- Yeah. - You know, I thought I recognized you.

331
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:09,352
You tried out for the football team last year, right?

332
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,230
Let's go call your mom.

333
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:16,234
Oh, no, no, that... No. That wasn't like a real tryout.

334
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:19,029
I was researching a book I was writing.

335
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:20,447
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

336
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,907
Yeah? What's it about? Sucking at sports?

337
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:28,038
No, it's about the link between brain damage and football.

338
00:21:28,163 --> 00:21:30,373
No, it's a good book. Your friends'll love it.

339
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:33,626
You know, it's got mazes in it and, you know, little coloring areas,

340
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:36,296
sections, pop-up pictures. It's a lot of fun.

341
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,131
That's funny.

342
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,925
Okay, okay. You know what? Stop.

343
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:45,972
Hey, guys, I know of a party. Let's go, let's head.

344
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,141
You got to get out of the tree right now. Get...

345
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,852
Just get out of the tree right now, please.

346
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:52,979
What are you doing?

347
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,148
Did you see that dismount? All the chicks were watching.

348
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:57,692
You're making me look like an idiot. We both looked like idiots just now.

349
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:01,071
- Hey, how about you let me drive? - Oh, no. No, no, no. This is not a toy.

350
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:04,157
These 22s, I don't want you grinding them. No.

351
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,243
Why doesn't my little bunny just hop in the back seat?

352
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:11,581
God, I can't even tell you how much I'm not your little bunny.

353
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,209
Okay.

354
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,087
You'll call me.

355
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,388
{Y:i}Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?

356
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:27,972
Hey, man, what's wrong with your radio?

357
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:30,016
- I'm gonna drive her home tonight. - What?

358
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,727
She's an evil jock concubine, man. Let her hitchhike.

359
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,479
She lives 10 miles from here, okay? It's my only chance.

360
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,855
You got to be understanding here, all right?

361
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:37,357
All right. We'll put her in the back. I'll be quiet.

362
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,067
- Did you say, "Put her in the back"? - I called shotgun.

363
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,985
I'm not putting her in the back. You got to get out of my car.

364
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:42,404
- That's a party foul. - What rules?

365
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:43,697
Bros before hos.

366
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,573
Miles, I'm begging you to get out of my car. Okay?

367
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:46,658
You can't do this to me.

368
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,868
You got to get out of my car right now.

369
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:56,167
{Y:i}Who's gonna come around when you break?

370
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:59,129
Mikaela! It's Sam.

371
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:00,255
Witwicky.

372
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,924
I hope I didn't get you stranded or anything.

373
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,009
You sure?

374
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:05,885
So, listen, I was wondering if I could ride you home.

375
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:09,431
I mean, give you a ride home in my car, to your house.

376
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:11,683
There you go.

377
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:19,774
So...

378
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:26,072
I can't believe that I'm here right now.

379
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,118
You can duck down if you want. I mean, it won't hurt my feelings.

380
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,245
Oh, no, no, no. I didn't mean here with you.

381
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:37,584
I just meant here, like, in this situation, this same situation that I'm always in.

382
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:40,712
'Cause, I don't know, I guess I just have a weakness for hot guys,

383
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:44,341
for tight abs and really big arms.

384
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,009
Big arms?

385
00:23:47,969 --> 00:23:50,764
Well, there's a couple new additions in the car.

386
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,350
Like, I just put in that light there.

387
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:57,896
And that disco ball. And so the light reflects off the disco ball.

388
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:00,774
Yeah.

389
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:07,405
Are you new to school this year? It's your first year here?

390
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:09,324
Oh, no, no.

391
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,326
We've been in the same school since first grade.

392
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,744
- Really? - Yeah.

393
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,454
Yeah, a long time.

394
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:16,456
Well, do we have any classes together?

395
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,124
- Yeah, yeah. - Really? Which?

396
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:21,753
History. Language arts. Math. Science.

397
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,129
- Sam. - Sam. Yeah.

398
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:26,633
- Sam Wilkicky. - Witwicky.

399
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:28,426
God, you know what? I'm so sorry. I just...

400
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,220
- No, it's cool. - I just didn't recognize you.

401
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:32,764
Yeah, well, I mean, that's understandable.

402
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,768
No, no, no. No. Come on.

403
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,563
Sorry, I'm just working out the kinks. You know, it's a new car.

404
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:44,150
{Y:i}When I get that feeling I want sexual healing

405
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:46,986
This radio is, like, you know... It's an old radio, too, so...

406
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,780
{Y:i}Sexual healing

407
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:51,116
Look, this isn't something that I, you know...

408
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:54,202
I can't get this radio to stop. Look, I wouldn't try this on you.

409
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,663
'Cause this is like a romantic thing that I'm not trying to do.

410
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:58,498
Not that you're not worthy of trying something like this on.

411
00:24:58,581 --> 00:24:59,916
- No, of course not. - I'm a friend of yours.

412
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,335
I'm not a romantic friend. Romantic friends do this.

413
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,505
I mean, I'm not that friend. I mean, we... I could be.

414
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,132
{Y:i}I feel good

415
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:08,633
Just pop the hood.

416
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:12,262
Stupid. Shut up, shut up, shut up.

417
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:15,932
Whoa, nice headers.

418
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:17,600
You've got a high-rise double-pump carburetor.

419
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:20,103
That's pretty impressive, Sam.

420
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:21,438
Double-pump?

421
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:24,232
It squirts the fuel in so you can go faster.

422
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,028
I like to go faster.

423
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:32,032
And it looks like your distributor cap's a little loose.

424
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:34,993
Yeah? How'd you know that?

425
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:40,123
My dad. He was a real grease monkey. He taught me all about this.

426
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:43,668
I could take it all apart, clean it, put it back together.

427
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,962
That's weird. I just wouldn't peg you for mechanical.

428
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:47,047
Oh, my God.

429
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:48,715
Well, you know, I don't really broadcast it.

430
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,843
Guys don't like it when you know more about cars than they do.

431
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:54,596
Especially not Trent. He hates it.

432
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:57,557
Yeah, no, I'm cool with, you know, females working on my engine.

433
00:25:57,682 --> 00:25:59,225
I prefer it, actually.

434
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:02,228
- Okay. You want to fire it up for me? - Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.

435
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:04,522
- Thanks. - You know, I was thinking.

436
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:08,068
You know, if Trent's such a jerk, why do you hang out with him?

437
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:12,906
You know what? I'm just... I'm gonna walk.

438
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:14,699
Good luck with your car.

439
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:18,161
All right.

440
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:20,205
Walking's healthy, right?

441
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:23,583
Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no.

442
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,252
Come on, please. Please, you gotta work for me now.

443
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:29,172
Don't let her walk away. Come on, come on, come on. Please, please.

444
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:33,760
{Y:i}Baby come back any kind of fool could see

445
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,095
Hey!

446
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:40,141
{Y:i}There was something in everything about you

447
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,354
{Y:i}Baby come back you can blame it all on me

448
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:45,772
Hey!

449
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,068
Wait a second!

450
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:53,697
{Y:i}I was wrong and I just can't live without you

451
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:56,866
There it is.

452
00:26:57,492 --> 00:27:01,329
I had fun. So, you know, thanks for listening.

453
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:06,084
- Oh, yeah, yeah. - You... You think I'm shallow?

454
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:10,380
I think you're... No, no, no.

455
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:15,093
I think there's a lot more than meets the eye with you.

456
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:18,013
Okay.

457
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:19,973
Yeah.

458
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:22,600
All right, I'll see you at school.

459
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:23,768
All right.

460
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,151
That's stupid.

461
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:32,527
That was a stupid line.

462
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:35,447
"There's more than meets the eye with you." Stupid.

463
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:39,200
Oh, God.

464
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,203
Oh, my God. I love my car.

465
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:58,762
Hey, guys, I think the other team figured it out. Iran.

466
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:02,515
Come on, man. This is way too smart for Iranian scientists.

467
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,394
- Think about it. - What do you think, kid? Chinese?

468
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:09,105
No way. This is nothing like what the Chinese are using.

469
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,611
This is Air Force One. Level of flight, level three-three-zero.

470
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,780
{Y:i}We will hunt down this enemy. And when we do,

471
00:28:16,905 --> 00:28:19,074
{Y:i}we'll know just what to do with them.

472
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:21,785
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

473
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:40,178
{Y:i}Apparently, there are very few survivors.

474
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:41,513
Yes, Mr. President?

475
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:44,557
Yeah, can you wrangle me up some Ding Dongs, darling?

476
00:28:56,695 --> 00:29:00,740
I joined the Air Force to bring the man Ding Dongs. I'll be in storage.

477
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:27,100
Shoot.

478
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:42,782
Gross.

479
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,644
Do you hear that?

480
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,191
Are you getting this?

481
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:18,818
I think they're hacking the network again.

482
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:37,170
Oh, my God. This is a direct match to the signal in Qatar.

483
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:39,130
- Are you running a diagnostic? - Should I be?

484
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:41,216
- Yes, you should. - So I am.

485
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,646
Someone! They're hacking into Air Force One!

486
00:30:54,729 --> 00:30:56,272
We need a senior analyst.

487
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:58,233
- I think they're planting a virus. - A virus?

488
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:00,860
- It's streaming right now. - They are planting a virus

489
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:04,197
and stealing a whole lot of data from your system at the same time.

490
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,824
Code Red. We have a breach.

491
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:08,660
Air Force One, someone onboard has breached the military network.

492
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:11,538
I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear.

493
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:17,544
- You got to cut the hard lines. - What?

494
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:20,755
- Whatever they want, they are getting it. - Sir?

495
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,550
Permission to take down the Defense Network.

496
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:27,679
- Cut all server hard lines now. - Cut all server hard lines now.

497
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:52,078
Someone's tampered with the POTUS mainframe.

498
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:53,663
What the...

499
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:01,546
{Y:i}Shots fired in the underdeck. Repeat, shots fired.

500
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:04,466
{Y:i}Crew, prepare for emergency descent.

501
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:24,569
I want our President in that bunker.

502
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:28,698
And I don't want to discuss a damn thing other till that becomes reality.

503
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:31,910
That's our first priority. That's our only priority right now.

504
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,119
Air Force One is on the ground.

505
00:33:37,225 --> 00:33:39,853
Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

506
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,272
That's my car!

507
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,025
No!

508
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:48,278
No, no, no, no.

509
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:57,912
Dad, call the cops!

510
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:02,834
Where you going with my car, buddy? Where you going?

511
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:06,671
Hello? 911 emergency! My car has been stolen!

512
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:10,216
I'm in pursuit! Right? I need all units, the whole squadron.

513
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:13,136
Bring everyone! No, don't ask me questions, all right?

514
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:15,889
My father's the head of the neighborhood watch!

515
00:34:48,546 --> 00:34:50,090
Oh, my God.

516
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:07,941
My name is Sam Witwicky.

517
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:11,945
Whoever finds this, my car is alive, okay? You saw that?

518
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,781
Since this is my last words on Earth, I just wanna say, Mom, Dad, I love you,

519
00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:17,283
{Y:i}and if you find Busty Beauties under my bed, it wasn't mine.

520
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:19,369
I'm holding it for Miles. No, no, wait that...

521
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:22,122
Okay, that's not true. It's mine and Uncle Charles gave it to me.

522
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:24,165
I'm sorry. Mojo, I love you.

523
00:35:35,844 --> 00:35:37,971
No! No! No! No!

524
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:42,892
Oh, my God.

525
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:45,979
No, you're a good dog! Good dog! Good dog!

526
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:47,272
Oh, my God.

527
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:55,321
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! All right! Oh! No! No!

528
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,576
Okay. Please, please don't kill me!

529
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:02,996
I'm sorry! Take the keys! I don't want them! Car's yours!

530
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:07,250
Listen, listen, listen.

531
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,668
- Good, you're here. - Let me see your hands!

532
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:10,337
- No, no, no! It's not me! - Let me see your hands.

533
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:13,506
- The guy's inside. - Shut up! Walk towards the car.

534
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:17,177
Put your head on the hood.

535
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:33,193
Whoever did this finally managed to infiltrate our defense network,

536
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:35,820
which is what they tried to do in Qatar, only this time it worked.

537
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:37,572
- What did they get? - We still don't know.

538
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:40,825
- Talk to me about the virus. - It's a Spider-bot virus.

539
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:43,536
We're not sure what it's going to do, but it may cripple the system.

540
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:45,663
- Can we stop it? - Every time we try an antivirus,

541
00:36:45,747 --> 00:36:48,291
it adapts and speeds up. It's like it's not a virus anymore.

542
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:49,459
It's become the system.

543
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:52,712
Obviously the first phase of a major attack against the US.

544
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:54,422
The only countries with this kind of capability

545
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:56,841
are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.

546
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:59,886
- I'm sorry, that's not correct. - Excuse me, young lady.

547
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:02,222
I didn't see you standing there. You would be who?

548
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:04,140
I'm just the analyst who detected the hack.

549
00:37:04,224 --> 00:37:07,352
Hold on. It was you? You did it?

550
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:10,522
- Her team. - Sir, I was just trying to say,

551
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:13,233
they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.

552
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:16,027
Okay. Even a supercomputer with a brute force attack

553
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:17,862
would take 20 years to do that.

554
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:20,407
Maybe you can explain, then, how our latest satellite imagery

555
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:22,867
shows North Korea doubling its naval activity.

556
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:26,454
Maybe it's a precaution, because isn't that what we're doing?

557
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:29,916
The signal pattern is learning. It's evolving on its own.

558
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:32,293
And you need to move past Fourier transfers

559
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:34,587
and start considering quantum mechanics.

560
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:37,048
There is nothing on Earth that complex.

561
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:39,634
What about an organism? A living organism?

562
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:42,137
Maybe some kind of DNA-based computer?

563
00:37:42,262 --> 00:37:45,932
- And I know that that sounds crazy... - That's enough. That's enough.

564
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:48,935
We have six floors of analysts working on this thing.

565
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,396
Now, if you can find proof to back up your theory,

566
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:53,982
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you. But if you don't get a filter

567
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:58,028
on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna be off the team. You understand?

568
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:06,953
Look, I can't be any clearer than how crystal clear I am being.

569
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:10,206
- It just stood up. - It just stood up.

570
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,460
Wow. That's really neat.

571
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:15,670
Okay, chiefie.

572
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:18,840
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.

573
00:38:19,382 --> 00:38:20,759
What are you rolling?

574
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:23,178
Whippets? Goofballs? A little wowie sauce with the boys?

575
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:25,638
- No, I'm not on any drugs. - What's these?

576
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:29,267
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."

577
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:33,104
Is that what the kids are doing now? Little bit of Mojo?

578
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:36,858
- Those are my dog's pain pills. - You know, a Chihuahua. A little...

579
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,113
What was that?

580
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:46,951
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?

581
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:51,581
You wanna go? Make something happen. Do it.

582
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:54,876
'Cause I promise you I will bust you up.

583
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:57,504
Are you on drugs?

584
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:08,348
Let's hope this telephone line works.

585
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:13,353
Hey, heads up!

586
00:39:13,436 --> 00:39:17,065
Heads up! Hey! Heads up!

587
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:23,988
What the heck was that?

588
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,995
English, dude. English.

589
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:38,503
Whoa!

590
00:39:39,212 --> 00:39:40,672
Watch out!

591
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,431
- Open fire! - Contact! Contact!

592
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:50,598
Everybody, quiet. Settle.

593
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:52,851
Whoa, mother... What the hell is...

594
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:03,361
Get up! Get up! Come on!

595
00:40:10,452 --> 00:40:12,245
Go! Move it!

596
00:40:24,549 --> 00:40:26,676
Take cover!

597
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:31,056
Fig! Cover the rear!

598
00:40:31,681 --> 00:40:36,603
Cover fire! Move it! Fig, cover the rear! Epps! Cover the rear! Move it!

599
00:40:36,686 --> 00:40:39,731
Come on! Give me a mag!

600
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,567
Where's your papa? Where's your papa?

601
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,735
Papa!

602
00:40:44,402 --> 00:40:46,613
Sir, we need... I need a telephone.

603
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:49,115
- Telephone, telephone, yes! - Telephone!

604
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,784
Hey, I need a mag! Give me a mag!

605
00:40:50,909 --> 00:40:52,160
- Cell phone! - I don't know how to thank you.

606
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:53,244
Fire!

607
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:57,040
This is an emergency Pentagon call! I need you to... Do you understand?

608
00:40:57,123 --> 00:40:59,626
It's an emergency Pentagon...

609
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:03,630
I don't have a credit card!

610
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,842
Sir, the attitude is not going to speed things up any bit at all.

611
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:10,637
I'm going to ask you to speak into the mouthpiece very clearly.

612
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:15,058
I'm in the middle of a war! This is frigging ridiculous!

613
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:17,686
Ammo!

614
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:20,438
I need a credit card!

615
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:25,151
- Epps! Where's your wallet? - Pocket!

616
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:28,530
- Which pocket? - My back pocket!

617
00:41:28,655 --> 00:41:32,826
- You got 10 back pockets! - Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek!

618
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,829
All right, keep shooting! Keep shooting!

619
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:37,956
Okay, it's Visa.

620
00:41:38,164 --> 00:41:39,457
Also, sir, have you heard about

621
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,626
our premium plus world-service gold package?

622
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:46,881
No, I don't want a premium package! Epps! Pentagon!

623
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:51,177
Give me a status.

624
00:41:51,511 --> 00:41:54,139
Sir, we're tracking a Special Ops team under fire in Qatar.

625
00:41:54,222 --> 00:41:55,932
They say they're survivors of the base attack.

626
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:57,017
Survivors?

627
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:02,522
I ain't never seen this in my life!

628
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:04,357
{Y:i}Need gunships on station ASAP!

629
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:05,650
Predator's coming up in a minute.

630
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:07,152
We're linking the call to the nearest AWACS.

631
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:16,369
Unknown, man. I don't... Man, if you seen this shit...

632
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,372
Predator ETA two minutes.

633
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:30,050
Hey! Make way!

634
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:37,015
- What is that? - I don't know.

635
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,980
We need air support and we need it now.

636
00:42:44,064 --> 00:42:47,192
Roll in strike package Bravo on unknown target.

637
00:42:47,275 --> 00:42:50,862
{Y:i}I authenticate Tango Whiskey at time 0300 Zulu.

638
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:53,823
{Y:i}Attention, all aircraft. This will be a danger close-fire mission.

639
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:55,450
{Y:i}Weapons, I just got a call from Falcon Ops.

640
00:42:55,575 --> 00:42:57,243
{Y:i}Who's closer to Kill Box One Alpha?

641
00:42:57,369 --> 00:42:58,870
{Y:i}- Send the Hogs, sir. - Okay, send the Hogs over

642
00:42:58,995 --> 00:43:00,705
{Y:i}to Kill Box One Alpha. It's a danger close...

643
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:03,333
{Y:i}Switch the Hogs to Kill Box One Alpha, 300 feet danger close.

644
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:05,335
{Y:i}Friendlies in the area.

645
00:43:05,418 --> 00:43:08,463
Seven-man team north of orange smoke!

646
00:43:08,588 --> 00:43:11,800
Received Kill Box One Alpha. Engage hostile.

647
00:43:14,177 --> 00:43:17,430
Attack direction west! You're clear and hot!

648
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:22,018
{Y:i}Strike, tell me status of Hog right now.

649
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:23,978
Hog One-One Dark Star status.

650
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:29,442
- Lennox! The heat's coming! - Laze the target!

651
00:43:29,567 --> 00:43:32,112
We got a beam-rider incoming! Laze target!

652
00:43:39,494 --> 00:43:42,080
- Ready! Heat's coming! - What? Bring it!

653
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:44,791
{Y:i}Receiving radar jamming in vicinity of target.

654
00:44:01,141 --> 00:44:02,976
No frigging way that thing's still not down.

655
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:06,312
Spooky Three Two, use 105 shells. Bring the rain.

656
00:44:08,523 --> 00:44:11,985
{Y:i}Be advised, ground team is requesting 105 sabot rounds.

657
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:41,306
Did we lose them?

658
00:44:41,389 --> 00:44:43,975
{Y:i}Warthog One confirm visual on friendlies.

659
00:44:48,063 --> 00:44:49,189
Where's Fig?

660
00:44:50,148 --> 00:44:51,733
- Fig? Fig? - Oh, God!

661
00:44:52,692 --> 00:44:54,527
- God damn it! - Get a medic!

662
00:44:54,611 --> 00:44:55,695
Get a medic!

663
00:44:55,862 --> 00:44:56,905
- I'm sorry. - Black Hawk...

664
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,198
We'll get a medic. Just hold on. He's got a pulse.

665
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:00,200
We need a medevac. One man down. Patient care category urgent.

666
00:45:05,914 --> 00:45:07,624
Bring them home.

667
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:11,378
{Y:i}You get those men stateside right now.

668
00:45:11,878 --> 00:45:13,588
{Y:i}I want them debriefed in 10 hours.

669
00:45:20,345 --> 00:45:23,723
There's only one hacker in the world who can break this code.

670
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:36,903
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait! Stop!

671
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:41,700
I am sorry to bother you.

672
00:45:41,991 --> 00:45:43,618
- Maggie? - Listen, I need your help.

673
00:45:43,743 --> 00:45:47,706
No! This is my private area, my place of Zen and peace.

674
00:45:47,831 --> 00:45:49,499
- Listen to me. - Glen! Who is it?

675
00:45:49,582 --> 00:45:51,710
Shut up, Grandma!

676
00:45:51,835 --> 00:45:54,254
- What are you doing here? - Just give me a break, will you, please?

677
00:45:54,379 --> 00:45:56,464
Grandmama! Drink your prune juice!

678
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:03,972
- What level are you on, man? - Six.

679
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:09,477
Oh, here come the matrix! Here come the matrix!

680
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:15,942
Glen, seriously, don't you want to see something classified?

681
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:17,861
Yeah. Get low.

682
00:46:18,194 --> 00:46:22,115
- Here we go. Here we go. Double tap. - Hey, I just paused it. I just paused it.

683
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,075
Hey. I need a moment.

684
00:46:25,076 --> 00:46:26,411
- Please. - Sorry.

685
00:46:26,953 --> 00:46:28,580
Hey, man, save my game.

686
00:46:28,663 --> 00:46:30,540
How classified?

687
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:35,920
Like "I will go to jail for the rest of my life for showing you" classified.

688
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:38,173
Yes! One quick peek.

689
00:46:38,965 --> 00:46:42,135
Special Ops got a thermal snapshot of whatever hit the base in Qatar.

690
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,763
- I want to see it. - Well, the imager was damaged, sir.

691
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:46,431
The rangers are en route with the imager,

692
00:46:46,556 --> 00:46:48,475
but we also have a security issue.

693
00:46:48,558 --> 00:46:50,810
Circle logs indicate one of the analysts made a copy

694
00:46:50,935 --> 00:46:52,604
of the network intrusion signal.

695
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:58,902
The signal strength is through the roof. Where did you say you got this?

696
00:46:58,985 --> 00:47:01,321
It hacked the national military air-guard frequency

697
00:47:01,446 --> 00:47:02,989
in less than a minute.

698
00:47:03,114 --> 00:47:05,325
- No way. - Yeah.

699
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:11,206
Looks like there's a message embedded in the signal. Let me work my magic.

700
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:18,922
"Project Iceman"?

701
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:22,425
- What's Sector Seven? - Who is Captain Witwicky?

702
00:47:23,968 --> 00:47:26,304
Are you playing those video games again?

703
00:47:26,513 --> 00:47:28,473
Cops! Cops!

704
00:47:28,598 --> 00:47:31,309
FBI! Clear right!

705
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:35,230
Lock it down! Lock it down!

706
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:37,899
Cops!

707
00:47:38,191 --> 00:47:39,317
Lock it down.

708
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:42,946
Wait! I'm just a cousin! I'm just a...

709
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:47,617
Get off my Grandmama's carpet! She don't like nobody on the carpet!

710
00:47:47,701 --> 00:47:49,327
Especially police!

711
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:52,706
{Y:i}It was an awesome spectacle here an hour ago

712
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:56,710
{Y:i}when over 40 C-17 s lifted off of this very base.

713
00:47:57,335 --> 00:47:59,337
{Y:i}We're not told where they're going.

714
00:47:59,462 --> 00:48:00,463
Morning, Mo.

715
00:48:00,547 --> 00:48:02,882
{Y:i}The government has been very quiet about what's going on but in our...

716
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:04,592
{Y:i}- Mojo. Mojo. - They were headed directly

717
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:06,219
{Y:i}towards North Korea.

718
00:48:06,344 --> 00:48:09,222
Stop with the barking, Mojo. It's too early. Please?

719
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:14,561
Miles? Miles, listen to me. Listen.

720
00:48:14,686 --> 00:48:17,689
- My car, it stole itself, okay? - What are you talking about, man?

721
00:48:17,814 --> 00:48:20,734
Satan's Camaro. In my yard. It's stalking me.

722
00:48:28,575 --> 00:48:29,617
Stop!

723
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:31,453
No, no, no, no, no, no.

724
00:48:37,959 --> 00:48:39,085
Oh, my God!

725
00:48:39,919 --> 00:48:40,920
Sam?

726
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:44,966
Hi.

727
00:48:45,258 --> 00:48:48,553
That was... That was really awesome.

728
00:48:48,636 --> 00:48:50,722
- Well, it felt awesome. - Are you okay?

729
00:48:50,847 --> 00:48:52,849
I'm not okay, all right? I'm losing my mind a little bit.

730
00:48:52,932 --> 00:48:54,809
I'm getting chased by my car right now. I got to go.

731
00:48:54,934 --> 00:48:57,145
You know what? I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.

732
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:31,596
Oh, great. Cops.

733
00:49:36,726 --> 00:49:37,936
Officer!

734
00:49:39,562 --> 00:49:41,314
Listen!

735
00:49:42,857 --> 00:49:43,817
Oh, that hurt.

736
00:49:46,569 --> 00:49:48,071
Listen to me!

737
00:49:48,154 --> 00:49:51,032
Thank God you're here! I've had the worst day ever!

738
00:49:51,157 --> 00:49:54,786
I've been... I've been followed here on my mother's bike! Right?

739
00:49:54,911 --> 00:49:57,497
And my car's right there and it's been following me here!

740
00:49:57,622 --> 00:50:04,087
So get out of the car! No! Stop! Oh, God. Okay, okay! Okay, all right!

741
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:08,883
Okay! I'm sorry! I'm... I didn't mean to hit your car! Look!

742
00:50:10,176 --> 00:50:14,055
Okay, look, look, look! Stop, stop!

743
00:50:18,226 --> 00:50:21,021
Please! Okay, what do you want from me?

744
00:50:23,356 --> 00:50:24,733
Okay.

745
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,740
Oh, God, no! No!

746
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:39,122
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, shit, shit! Oh, God! Oh, shit!

747
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:43,918
It's a bad dream.

748
00:50:45,795 --> 00:50:47,547
Are you username LadiesMan217?

749
00:50:47,672 --> 00:50:48,840
I don't know what you're talking about!

750
00:50:48,923 --> 00:50:51,301
Are you username LadiesMan217?

751
00:50:51,384 --> 00:50:52,510
Yeah.

752
00:50:52,635 --> 00:50:55,055
Where is eBay item 21153?

753
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:56,890
Where are the glasses?

754
00:51:08,443 --> 00:51:09,736
Get back!

755
00:51:10,612 --> 00:51:11,571
Stop!

756
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:15,700
God!

757
00:51:16,576 --> 00:51:18,370
What is your problem, Sam?

758
00:51:18,453 --> 00:51:20,455
Okay, there's a monster right there! It just attacked me!

759
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:25,001
Here he comes! All right, get up. Get up and run! You have to run! Okay.

760
00:51:32,676 --> 00:51:33,718
Sam, what is that thing?

761
00:51:33,802 --> 00:51:35,178
- You have to get in the car. Get in. - I don't want to.

762
00:51:35,261 --> 00:51:37,389
- Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me! - Sam.

763
00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:41,851
Get in! Go, go, go, go, go.

764
00:51:53,446 --> 00:51:54,781
Go, go, go, go!

765
00:51:59,411 --> 00:52:01,204
Oh, God! We're gonna die! We're gonna die!

766
00:52:01,287 --> 00:52:02,872
No, we're not. No, we're not gonna die.

767
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:05,291
- Oh, my God! - Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!

768
00:52:05,917 --> 00:52:07,293
Oh, my God! No!

769
00:52:07,419 --> 00:52:08,712
We're gonna die!

770
00:52:14,759 --> 00:52:16,136
Oh, my God!

771
00:52:33,528 --> 00:52:34,654
We're locked in.

772
00:52:37,157 --> 00:52:40,618
The car won't start. At least we ditched the monster, right?

773
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:47,625
Okay.

774
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:50,670
Time to start.

775
00:53:55,026 --> 00:53:56,319
He's got me! Oh, God!

776
00:54:02,867 --> 00:54:04,744
He's going to kill me!

777
00:54:07,872 --> 00:54:09,541
No. No, no, no!

778
00:54:24,097 --> 00:54:25,306
Get off!

779
00:54:39,946 --> 00:54:40,989
Kill it! Kill it!

780
00:54:41,114 --> 00:54:42,657
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

781
00:54:49,497 --> 00:54:51,458
Not so tough without a head, are you?

782
00:54:57,464 --> 00:54:58,882
Here, come on.

783
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:15,190
What is it?

784
00:55:16,608 --> 00:55:18,026
It's a robot.

785
00:55:19,444 --> 00:55:20,737
But like a...

786
00:55:20,862 --> 00:55:24,366
Like a different... You know, like a super-advanced robot.

787
00:55:25,742 --> 00:55:27,160
It's probably Japanese.

788
00:55:27,285 --> 00:55:29,662
Yeah, it's definitely Japanese.

789
00:55:31,289 --> 00:55:32,999
What are you doing?

790
00:55:33,625 --> 00:55:36,795
I don't think it wants to hurt us. It would have done that already.

791
00:55:36,878 --> 00:55:39,172
Really? Well, do you speak robot?

792
00:55:39,297 --> 00:55:42,676
Because they just had, like, a giant droid death match.

793
00:55:44,052 --> 00:55:47,222
- I think it wants something from me. - What?

794
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:49,808
Well, 'cause the other one was talking about my eBay page.

795
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:53,478
You are the strangest boy I have ever met.

796
00:55:53,978 --> 00:55:56,147
{Y:i}- Can you talk? - XM Satellite Radio...

797
00:55:56,231 --> 00:55:59,818
{Y:i}Digital cable brings you... ... Columbia Broadcasting System...

798
00:55:59,901 --> 00:56:01,695
So you... You talk through the radio?

799
00:56:01,778 --> 00:56:04,698
{Y:i}Thank you, you're beautiful. You're wonderful, you're wonderful.

800
00:56:04,781 --> 00:56:06,783
So, what was that last night? What was that?

801
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:08,368
{Y:i}Message from Starfleet, Captain...

802
00:56:08,451 --> 00:56:10,495
{Y:i}Throughout the inanimate vastness of space...

803
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:12,580
{Y:i}Angels will rain down like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah!

804
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:14,833
Visitors from heaven? What...

805
00:56:14,916 --> 00:56:17,043
What are you, like, an alien or something?

806
00:56:22,882 --> 00:56:25,343
{Y:i}Any more questions you want to ask?

807
00:56:26,052 --> 00:56:28,179
He wants us to get in the car.

808
00:56:29,222 --> 00:56:30,724
And go where?

809
00:56:31,725 --> 00:56:33,476
Fifty years from now, when you're looking back at your life,

810
00:56:33,601 --> 00:56:36,688
don't you want to be able to say you had the guts to get in the car?

811
00:57:06,134 --> 00:57:07,886
This car's a pretty good driver.

812
00:57:07,969 --> 00:57:09,137
I know.

813
00:57:11,806 --> 00:57:13,767
Why don't you go sit in that seat, there?

814
00:57:13,933 --> 00:57:16,061
I'm not going to sit in that seat. He's driving.

815
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:17,228
Yeah.

816
00:57:18,688 --> 00:57:20,148
You're right.

817
00:57:21,691 --> 00:57:24,652
- Well, maybe you should sit in my lap. - Why?

818
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:29,616
Well, I have the only seat belt here. You know, safety first.

819
00:57:31,659 --> 00:57:33,078
- Yeah, all right. - Right?

820
00:57:33,161 --> 00:57:34,746
- Yeah. - Okay.

821
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:39,209
There, see? That's better.

822
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:40,919
- Okay. - Okay.

823
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:47,967
You know, that seat belt thing was a pretty smooth move.

824
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:50,011
Thank you.

825
00:57:51,096 --> 00:57:53,223
You know what I don't understand?

826
00:57:53,306 --> 00:57:56,393
Why, if he's supposed to be, like, this super-advanced robot,

827
00:57:56,476 --> 00:57:59,104
does he transform back into this piece-of-crap Camaro?

828
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:01,815
Whoa! Whoa!

829
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,693
Oh, see? No. Get... No, that doesn't work. See?

830
00:58:04,818 --> 00:58:05,860
Move it, you moron!

831
00:58:05,985 --> 00:58:07,987
Great, now... See?

832
00:58:09,406 --> 00:58:10,532
Fantastic.

833
00:58:10,657 --> 00:58:12,492
Now you pissed him off.

834
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:14,285
That car is sensitive.

835
00:58:14,369 --> 00:58:16,579
I mean, $4000 just drove off.

836
00:58:29,718 --> 00:58:30,802
What?

837
00:59:34,574 --> 00:59:35,950
This is you...

838
00:59:41,081 --> 00:59:42,999
Oh, my God!

839
00:59:50,256 --> 00:59:51,925
Come on, let's go.

840
00:59:56,846 --> 01:00:00,058
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen! Explosions everywhere!

841
01:00:00,141 --> 01:00:03,603
{Y:i}This is easily a hundred times cooler than Armageddon. I swear to God!

842
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:05,939
Fire, fire, fire, fire!

843
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:21,579
Whoa! Sweet!

844
01:00:21,663 --> 01:00:23,790
Oh, dude, I hope this guy's got asteroid insurance,

845
01:00:23,915 --> 01:00:25,166
'cause he is so boned!

846
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:30,422
What is that?

847
01:00:30,964 --> 01:00:32,549
There's something in the tree, dude.

848
01:00:32,632 --> 01:00:34,759
No, there's something in the thing by the tree!

849
01:00:34,884 --> 01:00:36,219
Could you guys just give me a space rock?

850
01:01:11,629 --> 01:01:14,132
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?

851
01:01:15,383 --> 01:01:18,720
Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing out here by yourself?

852
01:01:18,845 --> 01:01:21,306
Holy God! What happened to the pool?

853
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:58,069
Are you Samuel James Witwicky, descendent of Archibald Witwicky?

854
01:02:59,237 --> 01:03:00,697
They know your name.

855
01:03:00,697 --> 01:03:00,989
They know your name.

856
01:03:01,948 --> 01:03:02,907
Yeah.

857
01:03:02,991 --> 01:03:05,452
My name is Optimus Prime.

858
01:03:05,535 --> 01:03:09,581
We are autonomous robotic organisms from the planet Cybertron.

859
01:03:09,706 --> 01:03:13,084
- But you can call us Autobots for short. - Autobots.

860
01:03:13,293 --> 01:03:18,548
- What's cracking, little bitches? - My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz.

861
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:22,177
This looks like a cool place to kick it.

862
01:03:22,761 --> 01:03:24,637
What is that? How did he learn to talk like that?

863
01:03:24,721 --> 01:03:28,308
We've learned Earth's languages through the World Wide Web.

864
01:03:29,809 --> 01:03:32,312
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.

865
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:36,775
- You feeling lucky, punk? - Easy, Ironhide.

866
01:03:36,858 --> 01:03:40,111
Just kidding. I just wanted to show him my cannons.

867
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:43,490
Our medical officer, Ratchet.

868
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:47,744
The boy's pheromone level suggests he wants to mate with the female.

869
01:03:50,163 --> 01:03:53,500
You already know your guardian, Bumblebee.

870
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:55,377
Bumblebee, right?

871
01:03:55,502 --> 01:03:57,170
{Y:i}Check on the rep Yep, second to none

872
01:03:57,295 --> 01:03:59,673
So you're my guardian, huh?

873
01:03:59,756 --> 01:04:04,969
His vocal processors were damaged in battle. I'm still working on them.

874
01:04:09,808 --> 01:04:11,184
Why are you here?

875
01:04:11,267 --> 01:04:16,523
We are here looking for the All Spark. And we must find it before Megatron.

876
01:04:16,856 --> 01:04:18,274
Mega-what?

877
01:04:27,867 --> 01:04:33,456
{Y:i}Our planet was once a powerful empire, peaceful and just,

878
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:39,379
{Y:i}until we were betrayed by Megatron, leader of the Decepticons.

879
01:04:40,463 --> 01:04:43,717
{Y:i}All who defied them were destroyed.

880
01:04:43,842 --> 01:04:49,931
{Y:i}Our war finally consumed the planet, and the All Spark was lost to the stars.

881
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:56,896
{Y:i}Megatron followed it to Earth, where Captain Witwicky found him.

882
01:04:58,064 --> 01:04:59,774
My grandfather.

883
01:04:59,899 --> 01:05:04,070
{Y:i}It was an accident that intertwined our fates.

884
01:05:07,282 --> 01:05:08,867
Come back!

885
01:05:11,411 --> 01:05:13,955
I think the dogs have found something.

886
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,791
The ice is cracking!

887
01:05:26,176 --> 01:05:29,220
Captain! Grab my rope, Captain!

888
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:31,931
I'm all right, lads!

889
01:05:33,099 --> 01:05:35,727
Can we throw you a rope, Captain?

890
01:05:43,109 --> 01:05:48,239
{Y:i}Megatron crash-landed before he could retrieve the Cube.

891
01:05:51,785 --> 01:05:55,246
Men! We've made a discovery!

892
01:05:55,372 --> 01:05:59,793
{Y:i}He accidentally activated his navigation system.

893
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:19,187
{Y:i}The coordinates to the Cube's location on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.

894
01:06:19,312 --> 01:06:21,314
How'd you know about his glasses?

895
01:06:21,439 --> 01:06:23,650
- EBay. - EBay.

896
01:06:23,775 --> 01:06:26,945
If the Decepticons find the All Spark,

897
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:32,867
they will use its power to transform Earth's machines and build a new army.

898
01:06:32,992 --> 01:06:36,371
And the human race will be extinguished.

899
01:06:36,496 --> 01:06:41,960
Sam Witwicky, you hold the key to Earth's survival.

900
01:06:45,171 --> 01:06:48,133
Please tell me that you have those glasses.

901
01:06:52,053 --> 01:06:55,515
It's like a self-regenerating molecular armor.

902
01:06:55,598 --> 01:06:57,600
Look at the scorch mark where the sabot round hit.

903
01:06:57,684 --> 01:06:58,977
Melted right through.

904
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:02,272
Hey, aren't sabots hot-loaded for, like, a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?

905
01:07:02,397 --> 01:07:04,607
Close to it. It melts tank armor.

906
01:07:04,691 --> 01:07:06,901
So this metal skin must react to extreme heat.

907
01:07:07,277 --> 01:07:09,320
- Heads up! - Oh!

908
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:12,699
I thought you said that thing was dead, man!

909
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:16,870
Strap it down! Strap it! This thing is wicked.

910
01:07:16,953 --> 01:07:18,288
All right, get on the horn with Northern Command.

911
01:07:18,371 --> 01:07:20,665
Tell them that our effective weapon is high-heat sabot rounds.

912
01:07:20,749 --> 01:07:22,208
Recommend we load them on all the gunships. Go.

913
01:07:27,464 --> 01:07:29,132
You want that piece?

914
01:07:29,257 --> 01:07:32,552
Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break it down to you how it's gonna happen.

915
01:07:32,677 --> 01:07:34,721
They gonna come through that door and be good cop, bad cop.

916
01:07:34,846 --> 01:07:38,141
Don't fall for that, all right? That's why I ate their food.

917
01:07:38,266 --> 01:07:40,810
See, they put the plate of donuts out here to test your guilt.

918
01:07:40,935 --> 01:07:43,396
If you don't touch it, you're guilty.

919
01:07:43,521 --> 01:07:47,317
I ate the whole plate. The whole plate. Okay?

920
01:07:47,442 --> 01:07:48,610
It's me and you.

921
01:07:48,693 --> 01:07:51,529
They walk through that door, you don't say nothing.

922
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:08,630
She did it! She did it! She's the one you want! All right?

923
01:08:08,713 --> 01:08:10,340
I was just sitting at home watching cartoons,

924
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:12,467
playing video games with my cousin, and she came in there.

925
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:13,551
- And then... - Glen, you freak.

926
01:08:13,635 --> 01:08:15,845
Hey! I am not going to jail for you or anybody else!

927
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:20,684
I have done nothing bad my entire life! Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.

928
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:21,726
Okay, so what?

929
01:08:21,851 --> 01:08:23,937
I've downloaded a couple of thousand songs off the Internet.

930
01:08:24,062 --> 01:08:25,730
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?

931
01:08:25,855 --> 01:08:26,815
- I promise! - Glen, shut up!

932
01:08:26,898 --> 01:08:30,735
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me! Don't talk to me, criminal!

933
01:08:33,071 --> 01:08:35,156
- Oh, sugar rush. - This is... This is not his fault.

934
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:36,866
See? So can I go home now?

935
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:39,202
- Oh, okay. I won't. - But just listen to me.

936
01:08:39,285 --> 01:08:42,997
Okay, whoever hacked into your military system downloaded a file, all right?

937
01:08:43,081 --> 01:08:45,417
It was something about someone named Witwicky

938
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:49,129
and some government group, right? Named Sector Seven.

939
01:08:49,254 --> 01:08:50,964
You have to let me talk to Defense Secretary Keller

940
01:08:51,089 --> 01:08:53,383
before you go to war with the wrong country!

941
01:08:53,466 --> 01:08:56,302
{Y:i}Whatever fell out of the sky ended up right behind...

942
01:08:56,428 --> 01:08:58,013
- What did he say? - What?

943
01:08:58,096 --> 01:08:59,597
- Did he hear it, too? - Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah.

944
01:08:59,681 --> 01:09:02,225
- What does he think it is? - He thinks it's a military experiment.

945
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:03,768
- What a knucklehead. - Yeah, well, I think it's a plane.

946
01:09:09,107 --> 01:09:10,942
{Y:i}Still no official word as to what happened. You can see...

947
01:09:11,067 --> 01:09:12,235
{Y:i}- Yeah! - Call Sam.

948
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:13,903
- Yeah. Why? - He should be home in 15 minutes.

949
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:15,321
Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.

950
01:09:15,447 --> 01:09:17,949
If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late and you'll have to ground him.

951
01:09:18,074 --> 01:09:19,701
Well, I can't ground him if he's not late, can I?

952
01:09:24,956 --> 01:09:26,416
I need you to stay here, all right?

953
01:09:26,499 --> 01:09:27,667
You got to stay here and you're gonna watch them.

954
01:09:27,792 --> 01:09:28,752
- Okay, okay. - All of them.

955
01:09:28,835 --> 01:09:29,836
- Do you hear what I'm saying? - Yeah, okay, okay.

956
01:09:29,961 --> 01:09:30,920
Five minutes, all right?

957
01:09:31,629 --> 01:09:34,591
- Thanks for staying on my path. - Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey!

958
01:09:34,674 --> 01:09:36,634
The... Oh, the path. I'm sorry. I forgot about the path.

959
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,386
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing right now. How about that?

960
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:40,764
- You know, I buy half your car... - Yeah.

961
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:44,559
...then I bail you out of jail and then I just decided to do all your chores.

962
01:09:44,642 --> 01:09:46,227
- The chores. - Yeah. Life is great, huh?

963
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:49,189
Life... Life is fantastic, is how good it is.

964
01:09:49,314 --> 01:09:51,858
It's so... Oh, the trash cans. Sorry, Dad. I'm gonna do the trash cans now.

965
01:09:51,983 --> 01:09:53,068
No, no, I don't want you to strain yourself.

966
01:09:53,151 --> 01:09:54,652
No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad.

967
01:09:54,736 --> 01:09:56,196
- I'll do it. - It would hurt my feelings if you do it.

968
01:09:56,321 --> 01:09:57,655
- You sure? I don't mind, I don't... - I promise...

969
01:09:57,781 --> 01:09:58,990
No, no, no, I'm gonna do it.

970
01:09:59,115 --> 01:10:00,992
I'm gonna do the trash cans and I'm gonna scrape the grill

971
01:10:01,117 --> 01:10:04,996
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna sweep up the whole house right now.

972
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:07,457
- Tonight, right now? - Right now.

973
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:08,500
The...

974
01:10:10,502 --> 01:10:12,962
I love you. God, I love you

975
01:10:13,046 --> 01:10:14,798
just so much right now.

976
01:10:14,881 --> 01:10:16,341
You know, Mom wanted me to ground you.

977
01:10:16,424 --> 01:10:17,926
- You're three minutes late. - Right?

978
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:19,886
Oh, well, just another thing you did for me, Dad,

979
01:10:20,011 --> 01:10:21,346
because you're such a swell guy.

980
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:22,597
One more thing, huh?

981
01:10:22,681 --> 01:10:25,767
All right, I love you! Sleep good, handsome man!

982
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:27,977
What are you doing? What are you doing?

983
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:31,356
No, watch the path! Watch the path! Watch the... Please, please, please.

984
01:10:31,481 --> 01:10:34,359
No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!

985
01:10:34,442 --> 01:10:36,861
- Sorry. My bad. - Oh, I... You couldn't...

986
01:10:36,986 --> 01:10:38,947
You couldn't wait for five... You couldn't wait for five minutes?

987
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:41,866
I told you to just stay! Just stay! God!

988
01:10:45,161 --> 01:10:47,122
- I told you to watch them. I told you. - Okay, you know what?

989
01:10:47,247 --> 01:10:51,251
- They seem to be in a little bit of a rush. - Oh, this is bad. No!

990
01:10:52,544 --> 01:10:54,921
Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!

991
01:10:55,547 --> 01:10:58,049
- Oh, wet. - No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!

992
01:10:58,174 --> 01:11:00,927
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo. This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.

993
01:11:01,052 --> 01:11:03,847
He's a pet. Okay? That's all. If you could just put the guns away...

994
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:06,891
- Put the... Put them away. Please. - You have a rodent infestation.

995
01:11:07,017 --> 01:11:08,184
- A what? - Shall I terminate?

996
01:11:08,309 --> 01:11:10,478
No, no, no, no. He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua.

997
01:11:10,562 --> 01:11:13,773
This is my... This is my Chihuahua. We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?

998
01:11:13,898 --> 01:11:16,568
He's leaked lubricants all over my foot.

999
01:11:18,069 --> 01:11:22,240
- He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo! - Bad Mojo!

1000
01:11:22,365 --> 01:11:23,825
I'm sorry. He's got a male dominance thing.

1001
01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:25,535
That's all it is.

1002
01:11:25,618 --> 01:11:28,413
- My foot's gonna rust. - All right.

1003
01:11:29,456 --> 01:11:30,832
Okay, okay.

1004
01:11:32,042 --> 01:11:34,669
- Shut up and go hide! - Just hurry.

1005
01:11:37,881 --> 01:11:39,424
Autobots, recon.

1006
01:11:41,384 --> 01:11:43,970
I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen.

1007
01:11:44,095 --> 01:11:45,847
Got some ice on his nose.

1008
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:48,391
I had to slap him around a little bit.

1009
01:11:48,475 --> 01:11:49,851
You did not.

1010
01:11:51,102 --> 01:11:53,229
- You didn't even ground him. - Almost, almost.

1011
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:56,566
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.

1012
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:00,236
Come on, come on.

1013
01:12:05,075 --> 01:12:08,161
- What? What is this? - Time is short.

1014
01:12:08,286 --> 01:12:10,872
- They really want those glasses. - Come on. What are you doing?

1015
01:12:10,955 --> 01:12:12,624
- I'm gonna help you. - Okay.

1016
01:12:12,749 --> 01:12:14,709
- Please hurry. - Okay.

1017
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:18,088
- Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone. - What do you mean?

1018
01:12:18,213 --> 01:12:19,214
My glasses were in the bag.

1019
01:12:19,339 --> 01:12:21,174
They were in the backpack and now the backpack isn't here.

1020
01:12:21,299 --> 01:12:22,842
Well, they're gonna be pissed, so what do you wanna do?

1021
01:12:22,967 --> 01:12:24,010
So what I think you should do is you should...

1022
01:12:24,135 --> 01:12:26,304
You should check this whole... This whole section here.

1023
01:12:26,429 --> 01:12:29,349
Just give it a clean sweep, and I'll get the corner here.

1024
01:12:29,474 --> 01:12:31,893
Yeah, no, no, no. Not there. That's my... That's my private...

1025
01:12:31,976 --> 01:12:33,436
- Sorry. That's nothing. - You just...

1026
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,479
- You just told me to look... - I know,

1027
01:12:34,604 --> 01:12:35,939
but I didn't mean to look inside of my treasure chest.

1028
01:12:36,064 --> 01:12:38,775
You should be way more specific so I don't get in trouble in your room.

1029
01:12:38,858 --> 01:12:40,819
I'm already stressed out enough.

1030
01:12:40,902 --> 01:12:42,404
Okay. What now?

1031
01:12:44,823 --> 01:12:48,243
No. No, no. No, no, no.

1032
01:12:48,326 --> 01:12:52,288
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding. This is my backyard, not a truck stop.

1033
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:53,415
Oh, God. Oh!

1034
01:12:53,498 --> 01:12:57,627
{Y:i}Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed right here and now it's gone.

1035
01:12:57,752 --> 01:13:00,046
{Y:i}My moped's under there, man! Who's gonna pay for that?

1036
01:13:01,506 --> 01:13:03,258
Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.

1037
01:13:03,341 --> 01:13:06,302
- He's back here. - I can't deal with this. I can't...

1038
01:13:06,386 --> 01:13:07,971
What? Oh, no, no, no.

1039
01:13:08,096 --> 01:13:09,139
- This is my mother's flower... - Oops.

1040
01:13:09,264 --> 01:13:10,473
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.

1041
01:13:10,598 --> 01:13:12,600
If my parents come out here and see you, they're gonna freak out.

1042
01:13:12,684 --> 01:13:14,185
My mother's got a temper, okay?

1043
01:13:14,269 --> 01:13:15,812
We must have the glasses.

1044
01:13:15,937 --> 01:13:17,480
I know you need the glasses. I've been looking everywhere.

1045
01:13:17,605 --> 01:13:19,816
They're not here. They're definitely not here.

1046
01:13:19,941 --> 01:13:21,026
Keep searching.

1047
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,819
I need you to be quiet for five minutes.

1048
01:13:22,902 --> 01:13:24,154
Ten minutes. Okay?

1049
01:13:24,237 --> 01:13:25,989
Please, I'm begging you. You got to... You're making a racket.

1050
01:13:26,114 --> 01:13:28,116
I can't concentrate. You want me to look and I'm hearing...

1051
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:29,242
Calm down, calm down.

1052
01:13:29,367 --> 01:13:31,036
You got to do something here. You got to do something here.

1053
01:13:31,161 --> 01:13:33,830
- Autobots, fall back. - Thank you. Please, for five minutes.

1054
01:13:33,913 --> 01:13:35,790
Good? Good? Okay.

1055
01:13:35,874 --> 01:13:37,042
- Move! - Get away!

1056
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:38,835
What's the matter with you? Can't you be quiet?

1057
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,879
He wants us to be quiet.

1058
01:13:44,716 --> 01:13:48,511
Earthquake! Move, move, move, move, move! Earthquake!

1059
01:13:48,595 --> 01:13:49,304
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it! Duck and cover right now!

1060
01:13:49,304 --> 01:13:52,474
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it! Duck and cover right now!

1061
01:13:52,557 --> 01:13:54,392
How did you get over there so fast?

1062
01:13:55,477 --> 01:13:57,228
Wow! That was tingly!

1063
01:13:57,896 --> 01:14:00,732
- You got to try that! - Yeah, that looks fun.

1064
01:14:05,612 --> 01:14:07,614
- Sam? - Sammy?

1065
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:12,702
- What the hell is that? - I don't know.

1066
01:14:13,578 --> 01:14:15,288
- Sam? - That's weird.

1067
01:14:15,413 --> 01:14:17,123
- Sam! - Ratchet, point the light.

1068
01:14:17,248 --> 01:14:19,793
- Come on, hurry. - Listen, we got a major issue in here.

1069
01:14:19,918 --> 01:14:20,960
What's with the light? You gotta stop the light.

1070
01:14:21,086 --> 01:14:22,962
What's going on? Turn it off. You gotta tell him to shut it off.

1071
01:14:23,088 --> 01:14:24,214
- Shut it off. - Sam, are you in there?

1072
01:14:24,339 --> 01:14:25,382
How come the door's locked?

1073
01:14:25,507 --> 01:14:29,135
You know the rules. No doors locked in my house!

1074
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:30,428
You know he'll start counting

1075
01:14:30,553 --> 01:14:31,930
- if you don't open the door! - One more chance. Five...

1076
01:14:32,055 --> 01:14:33,014
Oh, dear.

1077
01:14:33,139 --> 01:14:34,891
- Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal. - He's counting!

1078
01:14:35,016 --> 01:14:36,393
- Sam, just open the door. - Three.

1079
01:14:36,476 --> 01:14:37,435
- Oh, my. - Two.

1080
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,604
- He's counting. - Stand back.

1081
01:14:40,105 --> 01:14:43,775
- What's up? What's with the bat? - Who were you talking to?

1082
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:46,861
- I'm talking to you. - Why are you so sweaty and filthy?

1083
01:14:46,986 --> 01:14:48,571
I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager.

1084
01:14:48,697 --> 01:14:50,907
We heard voices and noises and we thought maybe you were...

1085
01:14:51,032 --> 01:14:52,909
It doesn't matter what we thought. What was that light?

1086
01:14:52,992 --> 01:14:54,786
No, what light? What? There's no light, Dad! There's no light!

1087
01:14:54,911 --> 01:14:56,371
You got two lights in your hand! That's what it is.

1088
01:14:56,496 --> 01:14:57,747
- Maybe it bounced... - There was light under the door.

1089
01:14:57,872 --> 01:14:59,916
Look, you can't... You can't just bounce into my room like that.

1090
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,376
You got to knock. You got to communicate.

1091
01:15:01,501 --> 01:15:02,502
- We knocked for five minutes. - I'm a teenager.

1092
01:15:02,627 --> 01:15:03,962
- We knocked. - You didn't knock.

1093
01:15:04,087 --> 01:15:05,547
- You were screaming at me, okay? - No.

1094
01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:07,090
This is repression, what you're doing here.

1095
01:15:07,173 --> 01:15:09,551
- You're ruining my youth, okay? - Oh, for Pete's sakes!

1096
01:15:09,634 --> 01:15:14,097
You are so defensive! Were you masturbating?

1097
01:15:15,974 --> 01:15:17,058
- Judy. - Was I...

1098
01:15:17,142 --> 01:15:18,143
- No, Mom. - Zip it, okay?

1099
01:15:18,226 --> 01:15:19,561
- It's okay. - No, I don't masturbate!

1100
01:15:19,644 --> 01:15:20,687
That's not something for you to bring up.

1101
01:15:20,812 --> 01:15:22,313
- That's a father-and-son thing, okay? - Father-son thing.

1102
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:25,275
I mean, you don't have to call it that word if that makes you uncomfortable.

1103
01:15:25,358 --> 01:15:28,987
You can call it Sam's happy time or...

1104
01:15:29,112 --> 01:15:31,072
- Happy time? ...my special alone time...

1105
01:15:31,197 --> 01:15:32,157
- Stop. - Mom.

1106
01:15:32,282 --> 01:15:33,241
- Judy, stop. ...with myself.

1107
01:15:33,366 --> 01:15:34,409
- Mom, you can't come in and... - I'm sorry.

1108
01:15:34,492 --> 01:15:36,786
It's just been a weird night. I've had a little bit to drink.

1109
01:15:36,911 --> 01:15:38,955
- No, no, Dad. - Yeah, well, we saw a light.

1110
01:15:39,039 --> 01:15:40,790
Oh, parents.

1111
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:44,502
I don't know where it was, but we saw it.

1112
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:49,215
Earthquake! It's another one! Another earthquake! Get in the doorway!

1113
01:15:49,341 --> 01:15:51,593
- Okay! - Aftershock! Aftershock!

1114
01:15:51,593 --> 01:15:51,968
- Okay! - Aftershock! Aftershock!

1115
01:15:52,052 --> 01:15:53,053
Oh, I hate these.

1116
01:15:53,178 --> 01:15:54,429
- Got to ride it out. Ride it out! - Quick, hide.

1117
01:15:54,512 --> 01:15:55,555
- Hey, the lights are back on. - Hide? What?

1118
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:57,182
- Where? - Come on, get out of that tub.

1119
01:15:57,307 --> 01:15:58,641
Can't you take safety seriously?

1120
01:15:58,725 --> 01:16:01,978
- Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam. - Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh.

1121
01:16:02,103 --> 01:16:05,023
Oh, no! Look at the yard. The yard is destroyed.

1122
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:13,615
Judy? Better call the city. We got a blown transformer!

1123
01:16:13,698 --> 01:16:16,201
Power pole's sparking all over the place!

1124
01:16:16,326 --> 01:16:18,536
Oh, man. Yard's a waste.

1125
01:16:18,661 --> 01:16:20,330
Trashed. Gone.

1126
01:16:20,663 --> 01:16:22,123
- It's a wash. The whole yard. - You're kidding.

1127
01:16:22,207 --> 01:16:24,250
The parents are very irritating.

1128
01:16:24,376 --> 01:16:26,044
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Can I take them out?

1129
01:16:26,169 --> 01:16:28,880
Ironhide, you know we don't harm humans.

1130
01:16:29,005 --> 01:16:30,173
What is with you?

1131
01:16:30,298 --> 01:16:33,635
Well, I'm just saying we could. It's an option.

1132
01:16:33,718 --> 01:16:35,387
We heard you talking to somebody, Sam.

1133
01:16:35,512 --> 01:16:37,889
- We wanna know who. - Mom, I told...

1134
01:16:38,014 --> 01:16:39,808
Hi. I'm Mikaela.

1135
01:16:40,558 --> 01:16:42,852
I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's.

1136
01:16:44,312 --> 01:16:47,023
Gosh, you're gorgeous. Isn't that the prettiest girl?

1137
01:16:47,148 --> 01:16:50,026
- She can hear you talking, Mom. - Thank you.

1138
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:53,196
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to hear our little family discussion about...

1139
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:54,781
- Sorry that we're bugging you. - Do you have my backpack?

1140
01:16:54,906 --> 01:16:56,032
- Come on, hon. Let's go. - Oh, it's in the kitchen.

1141
01:17:13,425 --> 01:17:16,720
Oh, yes. Okay. Okay.

1142
01:17:16,845 --> 01:17:18,847
- Yeah. - Your mom's so nice.

1143
01:17:18,930 --> 01:17:19,931
I want you to distract my parents

1144
01:17:20,015 --> 01:17:22,308
while I slip out and get these glasses to them, okay?

1145
01:17:28,273 --> 01:17:30,817
- Ronald Wickity? - It's Witwicky. Who are you?

1146
01:17:30,942 --> 01:17:32,944
We're the government. Sector Seven.

1147
01:17:33,069 --> 01:17:35,196
- Never heard of it. - Never will.

1148
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,824
Your son's the great-grandson of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?

1149
01:17:37,949 --> 01:17:39,075
It's Witwicky.

1150
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:42,412
May I enter the premises, sir?

1151
01:17:42,495 --> 01:17:45,457
Ron, there's guys all over the front yard.

1152
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:46,499
What the heck is going on here?

1153
01:17:46,624 --> 01:17:48,752
Your son filed a stolen car report last night.

1154
01:17:48,835 --> 01:17:51,087
We think it's involved in a national security matter.

1155
01:17:51,212 --> 01:17:52,630
- They're ripping up my rose bushes! - National security?

1156
01:17:52,756 --> 01:17:53,798
That's right. National security.

1157
01:17:53,923 --> 01:17:55,508
My God, Ron, they're everywhere.

1158
01:17:55,633 --> 01:17:57,969
There's guys in suits all around the house! Look at this!

1159
01:17:58,094 --> 01:17:59,888
Could you stay off the grass?

1160
01:17:59,971 --> 01:18:01,431
Get me a sample and some isotope readings.

1161
01:18:01,514 --> 01:18:03,141
They're pulling bushes out of the ground!

1162
01:18:03,266 --> 01:18:06,478
Good Lord! They've got to get their hands off my bush!

1163
01:18:06,603 --> 01:18:08,063
- Drop the bat, ma'am. - Hey, hey, hey, that's my...

1164
01:18:08,146 --> 01:18:09,481
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.

1165
01:18:09,606 --> 01:18:10,940
But you'd better get those guys out of my garden

1166
01:18:11,024 --> 01:18:13,193
or I am gonna beat the crap out of them!

1167
01:18:13,318 --> 01:18:16,321
Are you experiencing any flu-like symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?

1168
01:18:16,446 --> 01:18:18,490
- No! - What is this?

1169
01:18:18,615 --> 01:18:21,326
How you doing, son? Is your name Sam?

1170
01:18:21,451 --> 01:18:22,911
- Yeah. - Well, I need you to come with us.

1171
01:18:22,994 --> 01:18:24,245
Whoa, way out of line.

1172
01:18:24,329 --> 01:18:28,375
Sir, I am asking politely. Back off.

1173
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,377
- You're not taking my son. - Really?

1174
01:18:30,502 --> 01:18:31,544
You gonna try to get rough with us?

1175
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:32,837
No, but I'm gonna call the cops

1176
01:18:32,962 --> 01:18:35,131
because there's something fishy going on around here.

1177
01:18:35,256 --> 01:18:37,967
Yeah. There's something a little fishy about you, your son,

1178
01:18:38,051 --> 01:18:42,013
your little Taco Bell dog and this whole operation you got going on here.

1179
01:18:42,138 --> 01:18:44,349
- What operation? - That is what we are gonna find out.

1180
01:18:44,474 --> 01:18:47,018
I think direct contact.

1181
01:18:52,482 --> 01:18:54,025
- Son? - Yeah.

1182
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:58,029
- Step forward, please. - Just stand?

1183
01:19:03,785 --> 01:19:05,245
Fourteen rads.

1184
01:19:06,871 --> 01:19:08,331
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!

1185
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,959
If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass!

1186
01:19:11,042 --> 01:19:12,752
Get me a sample on that vegetation ASAP!

1187
01:19:12,877 --> 01:19:14,379
Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!

1188
01:19:14,504 --> 01:19:16,339
- Yeah. - Not a word until we get a lawyer!

1189
01:19:20,635 --> 01:19:21,803
So,

1190
01:19:23,221 --> 01:19:26,683
LadiesMan217.

1191
01:19:26,808 --> 01:19:30,228
That is your eBay username, right?

1192
01:19:30,353 --> 01:19:32,689
Yeah, but, you know, it was a typo and I ran with it.

1193
01:19:32,772 --> 01:19:33,732
What do you make of this?

1194
01:19:33,857 --> 01:19:36,401
{Y:i}My name is Sam Witwicky, okay? And my...

1195
01:19:36,526 --> 01:19:37,652
Is that you?

1196
01:19:37,736 --> 01:19:39,946
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.

1197
01:19:40,071 --> 01:19:44,868
Last night at the station, you told the officer your car transformed.

1198
01:19:46,244 --> 01:19:48,538
- Enlighten me. - Well, here's what I said, okay?

1199
01:19:48,663 --> 01:19:53,126
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding that my car had been stolen...

1200
01:19:53,251 --> 01:19:55,378
- Really? ...from me, from my home,

1201
01:19:55,462 --> 01:19:58,423
but it's fine now because it's back! It came back!

1202
01:19:58,548 --> 01:20:00,258
- Well, not by itself. - Well, no.

1203
01:20:00,383 --> 01:20:03,803
Because cars don't do that because that would be crazy.

1204
01:20:06,931 --> 01:20:08,558
That's funny. That is so funny.

1205
01:20:08,641 --> 01:20:11,144
So what do you kids know about aliens, huh?

1206
01:20:12,312 --> 01:20:15,065
{Y:i}Oh, you mean, like a Martian? Like what, E. T.? No.

1207
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:16,691
- It's an urban legend. - Yeah.

1208
01:20:16,775 --> 01:20:17,901
You see this?

1209
01:20:18,026 --> 01:20:20,612
This is an I-can-do-whatever-I-want and-get-away-with-it badge.

1210
01:20:20,737 --> 01:20:23,490
- Right. - I'm gonna lock you up forever.

1211
01:20:23,615 --> 01:20:24,824
Oh, God. You know what? Don't listen to him.

1212
01:20:24,949 --> 01:20:27,327
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to get back to guarding the mall.

1213
01:20:27,452 --> 01:20:30,497
You, in the training bra, do not test me.

1214
01:20:30,622 --> 01:20:32,707
Especially with your daddy's parole coming up.

1215
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:34,209
What? Parole?

1216
01:20:34,292 --> 01:20:37,629
- It's nothing. - Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?

1217
01:20:37,754 --> 01:20:39,714
You know those cars my dad used to teach me to fix?

1218
01:20:39,839 --> 01:20:41,591
Well, they... They weren't always his.

1219
01:20:41,675 --> 01:20:42,759
You stole cars?

1220
01:20:42,884 --> 01:20:44,594
Well, we couldn't always afford a babysitter,

1221
01:20:44,678 --> 01:20:46,471
so sometimes he had to take me along.

1222
01:20:46,596 --> 01:20:48,890
She's got her own juvie record to prove it!

1223
01:20:48,973 --> 01:20:51,601
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.

1224
01:20:52,769 --> 01:20:57,399
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot in jail the rest of his natural life.

1225
01:20:57,482 --> 01:20:59,776
It is time to talk!

1226
01:21:06,533 --> 01:21:07,951
Big! It's big!

1227
01:21:12,706 --> 01:21:14,666
Go, go, go, go!

1228
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:17,752
- I can't see it! I can't see it! - Shift your weight towards the front!

1229
01:21:17,836 --> 01:21:19,295
All right! All right!

1230
01:21:33,852 --> 01:21:36,146
You A-holes are in trouble now.

1231
01:21:36,271 --> 01:21:42,819
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you to my friend, Optimus Prime.

1232
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:48,825
Taking the children was a bad move.

1233
01:21:48,908 --> 01:21:52,328
Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.

1234
01:21:55,915 --> 01:21:57,667
Freeze!

1235
01:21:58,293 --> 01:21:59,669
- Whoa! Whoa! - Give me those!

1236
01:21:59,794 --> 01:22:00,837
Whoa!

1237
01:22:02,297 --> 01:22:03,340
Whoa!

1238
01:22:14,142 --> 01:22:15,477
Hi, there.

1239
01:22:15,769 --> 01:22:20,523
You don't seem afraid. Are you not surprised to see us?

1240
01:22:21,232 --> 01:22:26,154
Look, there are S-Seven protocols, okay?

1241
01:22:26,738 --> 01:22:28,031
I'm not authorized to communicate with you

1242
01:22:28,156 --> 01:22:30,367
except to tell you I can't communicate with you.

1243
01:22:30,492 --> 01:22:33,078
- Get out of the car. - All right.

1244
01:22:33,745 --> 01:22:34,871
- Me? You want me to get... - Now!

1245
01:22:34,954 --> 01:22:36,456
All right, all right. Get out. Hey.

1246
01:22:36,581 --> 01:22:39,918
All right, I'm... I'm getting out. I'm getting out. You see?

1247
01:22:40,043 --> 01:22:43,505
Very nifty how you put us down without really killing us.

1248
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:45,173
You're good with handcuffs, too, now, huh?

1249
01:22:45,256 --> 01:22:46,257
How you doing?

1250
01:22:46,383 --> 01:22:48,093
- You weren't supposed to hear all that. - How's it going, huh?

1251
01:22:48,218 --> 01:22:50,387
- Yeah. - This is real.

1252
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:53,640
Now, listen. If I choose to engage with him, mum is the word, all right?

1253
01:22:53,765 --> 01:22:57,519
Sam, I have a record because I wouldn't turn my dad in.

1254
01:22:58,103 --> 01:23:02,273
When have you had to sacrifice anything in your perfect little life?

1255
01:23:03,858 --> 01:23:05,527
Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?

1256
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:08,488
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.

1257
01:23:08,613 --> 01:23:11,074
I'm the one who asks questions around here. Not you, young man!

1258
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:13,410
- How'd you know about the aliens? - Where did you take my parents?

1259
01:23:13,535 --> 01:23:15,537
- I am not at liberty to discuss it. - No?

1260
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:17,497
Hey. You touch me, that's a federal offense.

1261
01:23:17,622 --> 01:23:19,332
Do-whatever-you-want and-get-away-with-it badge, right?

1262
01:23:19,457 --> 01:23:22,252
Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden, with his big alien friend standing over there.

1263
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:25,588
- Where is Sector Seven? - Wouldn't you like to know?

1264
01:23:30,844 --> 01:23:31,803
Hey!

1265
01:23:31,928 --> 01:23:34,848
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.

1266
01:23:34,973 --> 01:23:37,017
Get that thing to stop, huh?

1267
01:23:38,351 --> 01:23:41,646
- All right, tough guy, take it off. - What are you talking about?

1268
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:44,441
- Your clothes, all of it, off. - For what?

1269
01:23:45,692 --> 01:23:47,527
For threatening my dad.

1270
01:23:50,613 --> 01:23:56,494
Little lady, this is the beginning of the end of your life.

1271
01:23:58,288 --> 01:23:59,956
You're a criminal.

1272
01:24:00,623 --> 01:24:03,418
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.

1273
01:24:04,878 --> 01:24:07,714
Those are nice. Now get behind the pole.

1274
01:24:07,839 --> 01:24:08,798
All right.

1275
01:24:08,923 --> 01:24:11,009
This is such a felony, what you're doing.

1276
01:24:13,053 --> 01:24:14,971
- I will hunt you down, okay? - He'll hunt you down.

1277
01:24:15,096 --> 01:24:17,265
- Without any remorse! - No remorse.

1278
01:24:17,349 --> 01:24:18,641
- Enjoy. - Okay?

1279
01:24:18,725 --> 01:24:23,188
- We have got to alert everyone. - They already know. Speaker.

1280
01:24:29,694 --> 01:24:31,654
Optimus! Incoming!

1281
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:40,580
Roll out.

1282
01:24:47,504 --> 01:24:50,840
{Y:i}Okay, I'm picking up rad readings under that bridge right down there.

1283
01:24:53,718 --> 01:24:57,097
{Y:i}Okay, I'm getting really good rad readings. Forty-two and higher.

1284
01:24:57,222 --> 01:24:58,515
Up you get.

1285
01:25:03,228 --> 01:25:05,230
{Y:i}Okay, we're dropping in.

1286
01:25:09,234 --> 01:25:11,861
{Y:i}Really strong readings right down below us. There he is.

1287
01:25:11,945 --> 01:25:14,114
{Y:i}Ship one and two, come on in.

1288
01:25:15,198 --> 01:25:17,826
{Y:i}That's it, right there. Mark him, mark him.

1289
01:25:17,909 --> 01:25:21,204
{Y:i}Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30. Right off the nose.

1290
01:25:21,746 --> 01:25:23,289
{Y:i}I got it. 12:00.

1291
01:25:27,377 --> 01:25:28,795
{Y:i}Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.

1292
01:25:31,756 --> 01:25:33,967
{Y:i}Got him going down the street.

1293
01:25:37,595 --> 01:25:42,142
{Y:i}Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him. Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?

1294
01:25:42,475 --> 01:25:44,644
{Y:i}Okay, I lost him. I lost him.

1295
01:25:45,228 --> 01:25:47,188
{Y:i}Okay, we're coming around.

1296
01:26:09,919 --> 01:26:11,421
Easy, you two.

1297
01:26:20,805 --> 01:26:24,059
No! No! No, Sam! Sam, don't drop me!

1298
01:26:24,726 --> 01:26:27,729
Sam, don't! Sam, don't! I'm slipping! I'm slipping!

1299
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:31,024
- Hold on! - No!

1300
01:26:34,736 --> 01:26:35,945
Sam!

1301
01:26:41,576 --> 01:26:44,704
{Y:i}All right, we've got him pinned. We've got him pinned in the river.

1302
01:26:44,829 --> 01:26:46,081
{Y:i}I'm in for the shot.

1303
01:26:46,164 --> 01:26:47,624
Stop! Stop!

1304
01:26:48,833 --> 01:26:50,627
Wait! No!

1305
01:26:54,005 --> 01:26:56,591
{Y:i}- Take the shot, get him. - Take the shot.

1306
01:26:57,175 --> 01:26:58,343
No!

1307
01:27:14,442 --> 01:27:16,528
No! Stop!

1308
01:27:17,153 --> 01:27:18,446
Stop!

1309
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:22,492
{Y:i}Get down on the ground! Get down! Get down!

1310
01:27:23,493 --> 01:27:24,828
What? Okay.

1311
01:27:26,705 --> 01:27:28,832
Look, he's not fighting back!

1312
01:27:29,457 --> 01:27:31,668
Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!

1313
01:27:38,049 --> 01:27:39,592
Stop hurting him!

1314
01:27:49,019 --> 01:27:50,687
Don't let him move!

1315
01:27:51,438 --> 01:27:52,981
I got him here!

1316
01:28:16,212 --> 01:28:17,255
No!

1317
01:28:21,259 --> 01:28:23,053
Happy to see me again?

1318
01:28:24,596 --> 01:28:27,307
Put him in a car with his little criminal friend.

1319
01:28:33,188 --> 01:28:36,232
I want that thing frozen and ready for transport!

1320
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:46,701
Hang back. Let me check it out.

1321
01:28:49,537 --> 01:28:50,914
Optimus,

1322
01:28:53,291 --> 01:28:55,752
are we just gonna stand here and do nothing?

1323
01:28:55,835 --> 01:28:59,547
There's no way to free Bumblebee without harming the humans.

1324
01:28:59,631 --> 01:29:02,425
- But it's not right. He... - Let them leave.

1325
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:16,815
The Chinese and the Russians are nearing our area of operations

1326
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:18,066
in the western Pacific.

1327
01:29:18,149 --> 01:29:20,360
We feel like this could get out of hand real fast.

1328
01:29:20,485 --> 01:29:23,238
But the next couple of hours may just define his presidency.

1329
01:29:27,575 --> 01:29:30,453
US and Chinese task forces approaching 100 nautical miles

1330
01:29:30,537 --> 01:29:31,871
of cruise missile range.

1331
01:29:31,996 --> 01:29:35,500
Tell the strike group commander that he's not to engage unless fired on first.

1332
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:37,585
- Yes, sir! - Mr. Secretary?

1333
01:29:40,005 --> 01:29:45,051
Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven, Advanced Research Division.

1334
01:29:45,176 --> 01:29:48,346
Never heard of it. I'm a little busy, Tom. I think you can see that.

1335
01:29:51,516 --> 01:29:53,977
- What's going on here? - I don't know.

1336
01:29:57,647 --> 01:30:00,316
Sit rep! Talk to me!

1337
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,819
- The whole room's gone down, sir. - I can see that!

1338
01:30:02,902 --> 01:30:04,571
The virus was coded to shut us down.

1339
01:30:04,696 --> 01:30:07,115
- General? - I'll take a seat.

1340
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:09,117
What do you mean, "shut us down"?

1341
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:12,203
They used our network to spread out to the whole world.

1342
01:30:12,328 --> 01:30:13,413
The blackout's global.

1343
01:30:13,538 --> 01:30:16,332
We have no communications, satellite and land lines are dead.

1344
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:20,962
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick up this telephone and call my family?

1345
01:30:26,926 --> 01:30:31,222
Mr. Secretary? I'm here under direct order from the President.

1346
01:30:33,224 --> 01:30:35,602
You really need to see what I have in the case.

1347
01:30:38,688 --> 01:30:40,231
You'll have to accept that there are certain things

1348
01:30:40,357 --> 01:30:42,442
you won't understand right away.

1349
01:30:42,567 --> 01:30:45,862
Sector Seven is a special-access division of the government

1350
01:30:45,987 --> 01:30:49,366
convened in secret under President Hoover 80 years ago.

1351
01:30:50,241 --> 01:30:54,371
You may remember NASA JPL lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.

1352
01:30:55,455 --> 01:30:59,709
We told them to report the mission a complete failure. It wasn't.

1353
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:02,587
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.

1354
01:31:03,213 --> 01:31:05,715
This was classified above top secret.

1355
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:23,358
{Y:i}EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes.

1356
01:31:23,441 --> 01:31:26,069
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.

1357
01:31:27,362 --> 01:31:29,447
This is the image from Mars.

1358
01:31:30,281 --> 01:31:33,076
Here's the image your Special Ops team was able to retrieve

1359
01:31:33,159 --> 01:31:34,911
from the base attack.

1360
01:31:35,704 --> 01:31:38,790
We believe they are of the same exoskeletal type,

1361
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:42,419
and obviously not Russian or North Korean.

1362
01:31:42,836 --> 01:31:45,505
Are we talking about an invasion?

1363
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:48,717
We intercepted the message from your Special Ops team.

1364
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:52,137
These things can be hurt by our weapons and now they know it.

1365
01:31:52,262 --> 01:31:53,972
That's why the virus shut us down,

1366
01:31:54,097 --> 01:31:57,392
so we can't coordinate against their next attack,

1367
01:31:57,475 --> 01:32:01,980
which I would bet my ridiculous government salary is coming soon.

1368
01:32:05,859 --> 01:32:08,194
Get word to our fleet commanders over the National Guard frequency.

1369
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:11,698
It's a shortwave radio channel. It might be still working.

1370
01:32:11,823 --> 01:32:15,118
Tell them to turn their ships around and come home. ASAP!

1371
01:32:15,243 --> 01:32:18,204
And inform all commands to prepare for imminent attack.

1372
01:32:28,423 --> 01:32:31,676
Captain Lennox, we need you and your team to come with us right now!

1373
01:32:31,801 --> 01:32:32,761
Let's go!

1374
01:32:37,807 --> 01:32:39,267
She's in here.

1375
01:32:39,684 --> 01:32:41,311
What's going on?

1376
01:32:41,853 --> 01:32:43,688
You're coming with me.

1377
01:32:44,147 --> 01:32:46,816
- You're going to be my advisor. - Me, too?

1378
01:32:47,859 --> 01:32:49,152
Who's this?

1379
01:32:49,944 --> 01:32:53,031
- He's my advisor. - He comes, too.

1380
01:33:04,334 --> 01:33:06,795
- So... - What'd they get you for?

1381
01:33:07,879 --> 01:33:12,175
I bought a car. Turned out to be an alien robot.

1382
01:33:12,258 --> 01:33:13,218
Wow.

1383
01:33:13,885 --> 01:33:15,011
Who knew?

1384
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:33,697
Make a hole! Watch your back!

1385
01:33:44,541 --> 01:33:47,252
Please, let this work.

1386
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:50,547
Fire it up, Optimus.

1387
01:33:51,548 --> 01:33:53,008
The code.

1388
01:33:53,133 --> 01:33:58,555
The code on these glasses indicates the All Spark is 230 miles from here.

1389
01:34:00,348 --> 01:34:04,144
I sense the Decepticons are getting ready to mobilize.

1390
01:34:05,311 --> 01:34:07,063
They must know it's here, as well.

1391
01:34:07,188 --> 01:34:08,523
What about Bumblebee?

1392
01:34:08,606 --> 01:34:12,694
We can't just leave him to die and become some human experiment!

1393
01:34:12,777 --> 01:34:16,781
He'll die in vain if we don't accomplish our mission.

1394
01:34:16,906 --> 01:34:21,119
Bumblebee is a brave soldier. This is what he would want.

1395
01:34:21,244 --> 01:34:24,164
Why are we fighting to save the humans?

1396
01:34:25,582 --> 01:34:28,918
{Y:i}They're a primitive and violent race.

1397
01:34:31,296 --> 01:34:33,256
Were we so different?

1398
01:34:34,174 --> 01:34:38,553
{Y:i}They're a young species. They have much to learn.

1399
01:34:38,636 --> 01:34:41,431
{Y:i}But I've seen goodness in them.

1400
01:34:41,556 --> 01:34:45,727
{Y:i}Freedom is the right of all sentient beings.

1401
01:34:45,810 --> 01:34:50,065
{Y:i}You all know there's only one way to end this war.

1402
01:34:50,148 --> 01:34:52,859
{Y:i}We must destroy the Cube.

1403
01:34:53,651 --> 01:34:58,239
If all else fails, I will unite it with the spark in my chest.

1404
01:34:58,323 --> 01:34:59,657
That's suicide.

1405
01:34:59,783 --> 01:35:03,578
The Cube is raw power. It could destroy you both.

1406
01:35:03,661 --> 01:35:08,124
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace to this planet.

1407
01:35:08,249 --> 01:35:11,544
We cannot let the humans pay for our mistakes.

1408
01:35:13,004 --> 01:35:15,715
It's been an honor serving with you all.

1409
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:19,636
- Autobots, roll out! - We rolling!

1410
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:34,818
Team attention! Present arms!

1411
01:35:35,527 --> 01:35:39,739
At ease. Captain, Sergeant. Got your intel. Excellent work.

1412
01:35:39,864 --> 01:35:41,533
Thank you, sir. What about the gunships?

1413
01:35:41,658 --> 01:35:43,785
They're being retrofitted with sabot rounds now.

1414
01:35:43,868 --> 01:35:45,161
If they hit us again, we'll be ready for them.

1415
01:35:45,245 --> 01:35:48,331
But it won't do us much good if we can't get world communications back up.

1416
01:35:49,874 --> 01:35:51,084
Hey, kid.

1417
01:35:52,168 --> 01:35:54,838
I think we got off to a bad start, huh?

1418
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:56,464
You must be hungry?

1419
01:35:56,548 --> 01:35:58,550
You want a latte? HoHo? Double venti macchiato?

1420
01:35:58,675 --> 01:36:00,301
Where's my car?

1421
01:36:00,385 --> 01:36:03,972
Son, I need you to listen to me very carefully.

1422
01:36:04,472 --> 01:36:06,182
People can die here.

1423
01:36:06,558 --> 01:36:09,227
We need to know everything you know. We need to know it now.

1424
01:36:09,352 --> 01:36:10,520
Okay.

1425
01:36:10,645 --> 01:36:14,357
But first, I'll take my car, my parents. Maybe you should write that down.

1426
01:36:14,482 --> 01:36:19,195
Oh, and her juvie record. That's got to be gone. Like, forever.

1427
01:36:20,822 --> 01:36:23,783
Come with me. We'll talk about your car.

1428
01:36:23,908 --> 01:36:25,201
Thank you.

1429
01:36:26,661 --> 01:36:28,371
The man's an extortionist.

1430
01:36:30,123 --> 01:36:31,458
All right, here's the situation.

1431
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:33,960
You've all had direct contact with the NBEs.

1432
01:36:34,085 --> 01:36:35,170
NBEs?

1433
01:36:35,253 --> 01:36:38,882
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials. Try and keep up with the acronyms.

1434
01:36:38,965 --> 01:36:42,594
What you're about to see is totally classified.

1435
01:36:51,770 --> 01:36:52,354
Dear God. What is this?

1436
01:36:52,354 --> 01:36:53,605
Dear God. What is this?

1437
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:58,443
We think when he made his approach over the north pole,

1438
01:36:58,568 --> 01:37:01,988
our gravitational field screwed up his telemetry.

1439
01:37:02,113 --> 01:37:06,076
He crashed in the ice, probably a few thousand years ago.

1440
01:37:06,201 --> 01:37:09,454
We shipped him here to this facility in 1934.

1441
01:37:09,579 --> 01:37:11,956
We call him NBE One.

1442
01:37:12,082 --> 01:37:14,417
Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you on everything you think you know,

1443
01:37:14,542 --> 01:37:16,920
but, I mean, that's Megatron.

1444
01:37:18,213 --> 01:37:20,048
He's the leader of the Decepticons.

1445
01:37:20,131 --> 01:37:23,468
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.

1446
01:37:23,593 --> 01:37:27,055
Your great-great-grandfather made one of the greatest discoveries

1447
01:37:27,138 --> 01:37:28,598
in the history of mankind.

1448
01:37:28,682 --> 01:37:31,601
Fact is, you're looking at the source of the modern age,

1449
01:37:31,726 --> 01:37:38,566
the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars, all reverse-engineered by studying him.

1450
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:42,445
NBE One. That's what we call it.

1451
01:37:43,029 --> 01:37:45,657
And you didn't think the United States military might need to know

1452
01:37:45,782 --> 01:37:48,118
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot frozen in the basement?

1453
01:37:48,243 --> 01:37:52,247
Until these events, we had no credible threat to national security.

1454
01:37:52,330 --> 01:37:54,207
Well, you got one now.

1455
01:37:55,166 --> 01:37:57,544
- So why Earth? - It's the All Spark.

1456
01:37:57,669 --> 01:37:59,170
All Spark? What is that?

1457
01:37:59,295 --> 01:38:01,840
Well, yeah, they came here looking for some sort of cube-looking thing.

1458
01:38:01,965 --> 01:38:06,720
Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA Megatron, that's what they call him,

1459
01:38:06,845 --> 01:38:09,264
who's pretty much the harbinger of death, wants to use the Cube

1460
01:38:09,347 --> 01:38:12,475
to transform human technology to take over the universe.

1461
01:38:12,559 --> 01:38:14,102
That's their plan.

1462
01:38:14,185 --> 01:38:16,604
- And you're sure about that? - Yeah.

1463
01:38:18,940 --> 01:38:21,192
You guys know where it is, don't you?

1464
01:38:22,652 --> 01:38:23,778
Follow me.

1465
01:38:27,407 --> 01:38:29,909
You're about to see our crown jewel.

1466
01:38:38,877 --> 01:38:42,422
Carbon dating puts the Cube here around 10,000 BC.

1467
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:46,968
The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.

1468
01:38:47,802 --> 01:38:51,681
They knew it was alien because of the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube

1469
01:38:51,765 --> 01:38:53,308
as well as NBE One.

1470
01:38:53,391 --> 01:38:55,977
President Hoover had the dam built around it.

1471
01:38:56,061 --> 01:38:58,438
Four football fields thick of concrete.

1472
01:38:58,563 --> 01:39:01,858
A perfect way to hide its energy from being detected by anyone

1473
01:39:01,983 --> 01:39:05,570
or any alien species on the outside.

1474
01:39:44,401 --> 01:39:48,196
Wait, back up. You said the dam hides the Cube's energy.

1475
01:39:48,822 --> 01:39:51,324
- What kind exactly? - Good question.

1476
01:39:55,912 --> 01:39:58,748
Please step inside. They have to lock us in.

1477
01:40:04,671 --> 01:40:06,339
Oh, wow.

1478
01:40:06,464 --> 01:40:08,466
What's that? Freddy Krueger done been up in here or something?

1479
01:40:08,591 --> 01:40:09,759
Oh, no, man.

1480
01:40:09,926 --> 01:40:14,389
Freddy Krueger have four blades, man. That's only three. That's Wolverine!

1481
01:40:14,472 --> 01:40:17,434
- Right? That's Wolverine! - That's very funny.

1482
01:40:18,977 --> 01:40:21,980
Anybody have any mechanical devices? BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?

1483
01:40:22,105 --> 01:40:23,523
I got a phone.

1484
01:40:26,735 --> 01:40:29,320
Nokias are real nasty.

1485
01:40:29,446 --> 01:40:33,867
You've got to respect the Japanese. They know the way of the samurai.

1486
01:40:34,659 --> 01:40:36,786
Nokia's from Finland.

1487
01:40:36,911 --> 01:40:41,458
Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange. He's a little strange.

1488
01:40:44,252 --> 01:40:49,799
We're able to take the Cube radiation and funnel it into that box.

1489
01:41:03,521 --> 01:41:06,816
- Mean little sucker, huh? - That thing is freaky!

1490
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:10,570
Kind of like the itty-bitty Energizer Bunny from hell, huh?

1491
01:41:21,581 --> 01:41:23,458
He's breaking the box.

1492
01:41:41,434 --> 01:41:42,560
Go! Go! Go!

1493
01:41:42,686 --> 01:41:43,770
Move!

1494
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,948
Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.

1495
01:41:55,740 --> 01:41:57,033
Banachek. What's going on?

1496
01:41:57,158 --> 01:41:58,993
Well, the NBE One hangar has lost power...

1497
01:41:59,077 --> 01:42:00,161
{Y:i}- What? ...and the backup generator

1498
01:42:00,245 --> 01:42:02,205
{Y:i}- is just not gonna cut it. - Do you have an arms room?

1499
01:42:08,628 --> 01:42:10,380
Megatron! Megatron! Megatron!

1500
01:42:10,505 --> 01:42:11,881
I'll bring security to the...

1501
01:42:12,007 --> 01:42:14,509
Get everyone to the NBE One chamber now!

1502
01:42:14,634 --> 01:42:16,219
- The lights are out! - Move it! Move it!

1503
01:42:16,344 --> 01:42:17,721
Let's go!

1504
01:42:17,804 --> 01:42:19,556
They're popping our generators!

1505
01:42:31,609 --> 01:42:32,944
Megatron melting!

1506
01:42:33,611 --> 01:42:36,656
{Y:i}16502. We're losing pressure.

1507
01:42:36,781 --> 01:42:38,950
Stand by! Set!

1508
01:42:39,075 --> 01:42:41,119
{Y:i}We're losing pressure!

1509
01:42:41,244 --> 01:42:44,664
{Y:i}The cryogenic system is failing! We're losing NBE One!

1510
01:42:49,419 --> 01:42:52,088
Forty millimeter sabot rounds on that table!

1511
01:42:52,213 --> 01:42:56,217
That's good. Get all the ammo you got. Everything you can carry. Bring it.

1512
01:43:01,765 --> 01:43:04,392
You got to take me to my car. You have to take me to my car.

1513
01:43:04,476 --> 01:43:05,518
He's gonna know what to do with the Cube.

1514
01:43:05,643 --> 01:43:07,562
- Your car? It's confiscated. - Then unconfiscate it.

1515
01:43:07,645 --> 01:43:09,397
We do not know what will happen if we let it near this thing!

1516
01:43:09,481 --> 01:43:10,774
- You don't know. - Maybe you know, but I don't know.

1517
01:43:10,857 --> 01:43:12,233
You just wanna sit here and wait and see what happens?

1518
01:43:12,317 --> 01:43:14,319
I have people's lives at stake here, young man.

1519
01:43:14,444 --> 01:43:16,154
Take him to his car!

1520
01:43:17,906 --> 01:43:19,115
Drop it.

1521
01:43:20,867 --> 01:43:22,535
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1522
01:43:23,828 --> 01:43:25,789
Drop your weapon, soldier.

1523
01:43:26,331 --> 01:43:28,041
There's an alien war going on and you're gonna shoot me?

1524
01:43:28,166 --> 01:43:29,167
You know, we didn't ask to be here.

1525
01:43:29,292 --> 01:43:31,461
I'm ordering you under S-Seven executive jurisdiction.

1526
01:43:31,586 --> 01:43:32,754
S-Seven don't exist.

1527
01:43:32,837 --> 01:43:34,631
Right. And we don't take orders from people that don't exist.

1528
01:43:34,714 --> 01:43:37,967
- I'm gonna count to five. Okay. - Well, I'm gonna count to three.

1529
01:43:40,595 --> 01:43:42,222
- Simmons? - Yes, sir?

1530
01:43:42,347 --> 01:43:46,393
I'd do what he says. Losing's really not an option for these guys.

1531
01:43:50,897 --> 01:43:52,857
All right. Okay.

1532
01:43:52,982 --> 01:43:57,612
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.

1533
01:44:01,032 --> 01:44:02,325
No, no!

1534
01:44:03,284 --> 01:44:05,954
Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

1535
01:44:06,037 --> 01:44:09,624
No, no, stop, stop, stop! Let him go! Let him go!

1536
01:44:10,834 --> 01:44:12,210
Are you okay?

1537
01:44:14,087 --> 01:44:16,172
They didn't hurt you, right?

1538
01:44:24,931 --> 01:44:28,727
Listen to me. The Cube is here and the Decepticons are coming.

1539
01:44:31,146 --> 01:44:33,231
No, no, don't worry about them. They're okay. Right?

1540
01:44:33,356 --> 01:44:35,567
They're not gonna hurt you.

1541
01:44:35,692 --> 01:44:39,195
Just back up a little bit. He's friendly. He's fine.

1542
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:42,574
Okay, come on. Put the guns down. They're not gonna hurt you.

1543
01:44:42,699 --> 01:44:44,159
Here, come with me. I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.

1544
01:45:06,264 --> 01:45:09,726
Okay, here we go. He doing something. He doing something.

1545
01:45:29,871 --> 01:45:31,206
Oh, my God.

1546
01:45:36,002 --> 01:45:37,420
{Y:i}Message from Starfleet, Captain.

1547
01:45:37,504 --> 01:45:38,922
{Y:i}Let's get to it.

1548
01:45:39,005 --> 01:45:42,050
He's right. We stay here, we're screwed with Megatron in the other hangar.

1549
01:45:42,133 --> 01:45:43,551
Mission City is 22 miles away.

1550
01:45:43,635 --> 01:45:44,928
We're gonna sneak that Cube out of here

1551
01:45:45,053 --> 01:45:46,429
and we're gonna hide it somewhere in the city.

1552
01:45:46,554 --> 01:45:47,514
Good! Right.

1553
01:45:47,639 --> 01:45:50,350
But we cannot make a stand without the Air Force.

1554
01:45:50,475 --> 01:45:52,519
This place must have some kind of radio link!

1555
01:45:52,644 --> 01:45:54,479
- Yes. Shortwave, CB. - Right, yes.

1556
01:45:54,604 --> 01:45:57,190
Sir, you got to figure out some way to get word out to them. Let's move!

1557
01:45:57,315 --> 01:45:58,733
In the alien archive, sir!

1558
01:45:58,817 --> 01:46:00,819
- The alien... - There's an old Army radio console.

1559
01:46:00,944 --> 01:46:02,445
- Will it work? - Anything's possible!

1560
01:46:02,570 --> 01:46:04,989
- Did you see that... - All right, Sam, get it in the car!

1561
01:46:05,115 --> 01:46:06,866
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.

1562
01:46:06,991 --> 01:46:08,618
When we get to the city, we're gonna find a radio,

1563
01:46:08,702 --> 01:46:10,662
and I'll have Epps vector them in, okay?

1564
01:46:10,787 --> 01:46:12,288
Affirmative!

1565
01:46:12,414 --> 01:46:16,251
{Y:i}Warning! NBE One cryo-containment failing.

1566
01:46:17,252 --> 01:46:19,129
Check that backup system!

1567
01:46:19,212 --> 01:46:23,383
The cryo's failing! You got to bump up the cryo! The cryo's failing!

1568
01:46:23,508 --> 01:46:24,968
Come on! Get out of here!

1569
01:46:25,093 --> 01:46:26,594
Heads up! Look out!

1570
01:46:27,637 --> 01:46:30,015
Set a perimeter around the yellow vehicle!

1571
01:46:30,140 --> 01:46:33,560
- This way, this way, this way! - Up there! Let's go!

1572
01:46:43,278 --> 01:46:46,322
I am Megatron!

1573
01:47:05,175 --> 01:47:06,551
- The Cube's okay? - Yeah, it's fine.

1574
01:47:06,676 --> 01:47:07,635
Well, put the seat belt on.

1575
01:47:07,761 --> 01:47:08,928
Pour it on him!

1576
01:47:22,692 --> 01:47:24,652
I live to serve you, Lord Megatron.

1577
01:47:24,778 --> 01:47:27,197
Where is the Cube?

1578
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:29,324
The humans have taken it.

1579
01:47:32,744 --> 01:47:36,581
You fail me yet again, Starscream. Get them!

1580
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:38,500
Come on, Mags!

1581
01:47:39,584 --> 01:47:41,086
Over here, sir!

1582
01:47:43,421 --> 01:47:45,507
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

1583
01:47:45,590 --> 01:47:48,051
Come to me, Maxwell, come to me. Plugged in there.

1584
01:47:49,928 --> 01:47:53,390
- We're hot! We're live! - Where are the mikes?

1585
01:47:54,432 --> 01:47:55,433
Mikes?

1586
01:47:55,558 --> 01:47:56,810
This doesn't work without mikes, Simmons.

1587
01:47:56,935 --> 01:47:58,478
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1588
01:47:58,603 --> 01:48:00,105
Let's find them.

1589
01:48:00,230 --> 01:48:01,690
Kid, get in the chair! Just get in the chair, all right?

1590
01:48:01,773 --> 01:48:03,942
- Okay, I'll sit. I'll sit. - They steal everything out of this place.

1591
01:48:04,067 --> 01:48:07,112
How do we get the signal out? How do we call the Air Force?

1592
01:48:07,237 --> 01:48:08,530
- Glen? - Huh?

1593
01:48:08,613 --> 01:48:12,117
Can you hotwire this computer to transmit a tone through the radio?

1594
01:48:12,242 --> 01:48:13,201
What good is that?

1595
01:48:13,326 --> 01:48:15,745
Morse code! You can use this to transmit it through that!

1596
01:48:15,829 --> 01:48:19,374
Okay, I'll do it! Turn it around. Okay, let's see.

1597
01:48:19,499 --> 01:48:21,334
Simmons, I need a screwdriver!

1598
01:48:33,138 --> 01:48:34,639
There's Optimus.

1599
01:48:52,615 --> 01:48:54,075
Almost done.

1600
01:48:55,910 --> 01:48:57,787
What the hell was that?

1601
01:49:00,874 --> 01:49:02,584
Barricade the door!

1602
01:49:05,295 --> 01:49:07,672
- Get something. - Watch out!

1603
01:49:07,797 --> 01:49:09,883
Six, five, four, six, three.

1604
01:49:14,554 --> 01:49:16,931
Here! Put some rounds in!

1605
01:49:19,809 --> 01:49:21,227
Master search.

1606
01:49:22,145 --> 01:49:24,105
I got it! We're transmitting!

1607
01:49:24,230 --> 01:49:25,357
Send exactly what I say!

1608
01:49:25,482 --> 01:49:29,611
Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Burn, you little sucker! Burn!

1609
01:49:29,694 --> 01:49:33,740
"This is Defense Secretary Keller. Get me NORTHCOM commander."

1610
01:49:33,865 --> 01:49:35,367
- Whoa! - Whoa!

1611
01:49:37,077 --> 01:49:38,119
What was that?

1612
01:49:38,203 --> 01:49:41,039
Authenticate emergency action. Blackbird 1195...

1613
01:49:43,208 --> 01:49:45,418
Sir, I have an authenticated air strike order from Sec Def.

1614
01:50:10,151 --> 01:50:12,112
- No, no, no, no, no. - What?

1615
01:50:12,237 --> 01:50:15,657
It's the same cop! Block them, block them, block them.

1616
01:50:36,886 --> 01:50:37,846
Oh, my God.

1617
01:51:06,416 --> 01:51:07,751
Cool, Mom!

1618
01:51:33,651 --> 01:51:35,653
This is so not good.

1619
01:51:54,172 --> 01:51:56,007
He's behind the pillar!

1620
01:52:01,888 --> 01:52:04,974
- Shoot that mother... - Maggie, cover fire!

1621
01:52:08,144 --> 01:52:10,480
It's the Air Force! They're responding!

1622
01:52:14,359 --> 01:52:16,319
Sucker, burn!

1623
01:52:22,075 --> 01:52:23,410
Oh, shit!

1624
01:52:23,743 --> 01:52:25,787
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!

1625
01:52:26,996 --> 01:52:28,998
{Y:i}Raptors, let's scramble, scramble, scramble.

1626
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:32,502
{Y:i}Strike and Dark Star roll call.

1627
01:52:34,838 --> 01:52:36,297
{Y:i}Looking out the right side.

1628
01:52:37,215 --> 01:52:39,342
{Y:i}Push to Kill Box One Alpha...

1629
01:52:46,933 --> 01:52:50,478
- Come on, let's go! Mount up! - Move out! Move out! Go! Go!

1630
01:52:50,603 --> 01:52:52,814
Here, I got shortwave radios.

1631
01:52:53,356 --> 01:52:55,525
Wait. What am I supposed to do with these?

1632
01:52:55,650 --> 01:52:57,944
Well, use them! It's all we got!

1633
01:52:58,361 --> 01:53:01,322
This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios or something, man.

1634
01:53:01,448 --> 01:53:04,367
I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles out of these things.

1635
01:53:04,492 --> 01:53:07,203
Are there any aircraft orbiting the city?

1636
01:53:07,787 --> 01:53:09,372
F-22 at 12:00.

1637
01:53:09,497 --> 01:53:12,208
All right, I want planes for air cover and get Black Hawks on station

1638
01:53:12,292 --> 01:53:14,169
to extract that Cube. You got it?

1639
01:53:16,671 --> 01:53:19,049
Air Force has arrived! Pop smoke!

1640
01:53:19,382 --> 01:53:21,009
Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?

1641
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:23,428
{Y:i}We have you visual.

1642
01:53:25,096 --> 01:53:26,431
{Y:i}Green smoke is the mark.

1643
01:53:26,556 --> 01:53:30,018
{Y:i}Provide air cover and vector Black Hawks for extraction.

1644
01:53:34,647 --> 01:53:36,608
It's Starscream!

1645
01:53:37,108 --> 01:53:38,735
Please tell me you copy.

1646
01:53:39,110 --> 01:53:41,404
Back up! Take cover! Bumblebee!

1647
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:47,160
No, no, no, no, no! Move!

1648
01:53:47,285 --> 01:53:50,413
- Back up! Back up! - Retreat! Fall back!

1649
01:53:50,538 --> 01:53:51,748
Incoming!

1650
01:54:16,856 --> 01:54:18,650
Anybody hurt? Everyone okay?

1651
01:54:18,775 --> 01:54:20,235
Clear the area!

1652
01:54:26,032 --> 01:54:27,575
Oh, my God.

1653
01:54:28,451 --> 01:54:31,287
Bumblebee? No. Your legs!

1654
01:54:31,746 --> 01:54:33,081
Your legs.

1655
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:38,253
Here. Here, back, back, back, back! You all right?

1656
01:54:39,796 --> 01:54:42,257
Please get up. Bumblebee? Get up!

1657
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:45,010
Ratchet!

1658
01:54:46,886 --> 01:54:48,346
- What the hell was that? - What are you talking about?

1659
01:54:48,471 --> 01:54:50,390
What do you mean, what am I talking about? They shot at us!

1660
01:54:50,515 --> 01:54:52,851
F-22 pilots would never fly below buildings.

1661
01:54:52,976 --> 01:54:55,145
That's alien. That ain't friendly!

1662
01:54:55,228 --> 01:54:58,023
You got to get up. You're okay. You're okay.

1663
01:54:59,315 --> 01:55:00,316
Come on!

1664
01:55:00,442 --> 01:55:02,569
{Y:i}Army Black Hawk inbound to your location. Over.

1665
01:55:04,362 --> 01:55:06,448
Alpha 273 degrees, 10 miles.

1666
01:55:06,573 --> 01:55:08,908
November Victor, 1.2 clicks north.

1667
01:55:27,135 --> 01:55:28,553
Move out! Let's go!

1668
01:55:35,018 --> 01:55:36,686
Let's go! Move!

1669
01:55:43,318 --> 01:55:44,986
I'm not gonna leave you.

1670
01:56:24,067 --> 01:56:26,111
Come on, Decepticon punk!

1671
01:56:32,450 --> 01:56:33,952
Oh, my God!

1672
01:56:46,506 --> 01:56:48,425
Concentrate your fire!

1673
01:56:59,352 --> 01:57:00,562
Come on. Come on.

1674
01:57:03,106 --> 01:57:04,816
Megatron!

1675
01:57:09,529 --> 01:57:13,199
It's Megatron! Retreat! Move! Fall back!

1676
01:57:17,454 --> 01:57:19,080
Fall back!

1677
01:57:25,086 --> 01:57:27,297
Get our guys out of the way! Get out of here! Go!

1678
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:29,424
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!

1679
01:57:29,507 --> 01:57:31,801
We need air cover down here now!

1680
01:57:37,807 --> 01:57:39,184
Sam, help me with this.

1681
01:57:43,355 --> 01:57:47,692
- That all you got, Megatron? - Come here, little cretin.

1682
01:57:47,817 --> 01:57:49,903
You want a piece of me? You want a piece?

1683
01:57:49,986 --> 01:57:52,322
No! I want two!

1684
01:57:53,865 --> 01:57:55,283
What's going on?

1685
01:57:57,077 --> 01:57:59,704
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.

1686
01:58:00,580 --> 01:58:02,832
Oh, these things just don't die.

1687
01:58:06,419 --> 01:58:07,921
Oh, we're so dead.

1688
01:58:08,004 --> 01:58:10,340
- Wrap it around the head. - Sam!

1689
01:58:10,674 --> 01:58:11,633
Where's the Cube?

1690
01:58:11,758 --> 01:58:12,717
- Right there. - Okay.

1691
01:58:12,842 --> 01:58:13,802
And take that and wrap it around

1692
01:58:13,927 --> 01:58:14,886
the base and then put it around his neck.

1693
01:58:15,011 --> 01:58:17,681
- Okay? - Epps, get those Black Hawks here!

1694
01:58:19,099 --> 01:58:20,558
That building.

1695
01:58:24,354 --> 01:58:26,147
- Okay. - What?

1696
01:58:26,231 --> 01:58:29,192
All right, I can't leave my guys back there, so here, take this flare.

1697
01:58:29,317 --> 01:58:31,569
Okay, there's a tall, white building with statues on top.

1698
01:58:31,695 --> 01:58:33,863
- Go to the roof. Set the flare. - No.

1699
01:58:33,988 --> 01:58:35,907
- Signal the chopper and set the flare. - No, no. I can't do this!

1700
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:40,412
Listen to me! You're a soldier now! All right? I need you to take this Cube.

1701
01:58:40,537 --> 01:58:42,747
Get it into military hands while we hold them off,

1702
01:58:42,872 --> 01:58:44,916
or a lot of people are gonna die.

1703
01:58:45,041 --> 01:58:46,543
- You got to go. You got to go. - No, I'm not leaving.

1704
01:58:46,668 --> 01:58:47,836
- You need to go. Go. - No, I'm not leaving

1705
01:58:47,919 --> 01:58:50,630
till I get Bumblebee out of here, okay?

1706
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:53,174
Army Black Hawk requested.

1707
01:58:53,258 --> 01:58:55,802
Immediate evac for civilian boy with precious cargo.

1708
01:58:55,885 --> 01:58:58,430
{Y:i}Headed to rooftop marked by flare.

1709
01:58:58,555 --> 01:59:01,641
- Sam, we will protect you. - Okay.

1710
01:59:03,226 --> 01:59:06,563
- Epps, where are those planes? - Sam!

1711
01:59:10,567 --> 01:59:14,696
No matter what happens, I'm really glad I got in that car with you.

1712
01:59:17,907 --> 01:59:20,535
Sam! Get to the building! Move!

1713
01:59:20,660 --> 01:59:23,913
- Decepticons, attack! - Hit it!

1714
01:59:26,624 --> 01:59:28,710
- Cover fire! - Move to cover!

1715
01:59:35,175 --> 01:59:36,468
Watch out!

1716
01:59:42,098 --> 01:59:45,101
- Girl, get that tow truck out of here! - I'm going! I'm going!

1717
01:59:45,226 --> 01:59:46,895
Get out of here now!

1718
02:00:14,756 --> 02:00:15,715
Megatron!

1719
02:00:16,007 --> 02:00:16,966
Prime.

1720
02:00:42,951 --> 02:00:44,994
Humans don't deserve to live.

1721
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:47,789
They deserve to choose for themselves.

1722
02:00:48,206 --> 02:00:50,583
Then you will die with them!

1723
02:00:56,256 --> 02:00:58,675
Join them in extinction!

1724
02:01:17,861 --> 02:01:19,529
Keep moving, Sam!

1725
02:01:20,530 --> 02:01:21,906
Don't stop!

1726
02:01:37,922 --> 02:01:38,923
No!

1727
02:01:54,147 --> 02:01:56,232
Sam, get to the building!

1728
02:02:04,157 --> 02:02:06,284
Give me that Cube, boy!

1729
02:02:18,922 --> 02:02:21,049
Did that jerk just dent my car?

1730
02:02:42,404 --> 02:02:45,865
You're not gonna get me. You're not gonna get me!

1731
02:02:51,162 --> 02:02:54,290
I smell you, boy!

1732
02:03:06,511 --> 02:03:07,679
Maggot!

1733
02:03:26,698 --> 02:03:28,283
Oh, no!

1734
02:03:52,849 --> 02:03:54,684
I'll drive! You shoot!

1735
02:04:15,663 --> 02:04:16,956
This isn't going well!

1736
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:18,458
Shoot! Shoot!

1737
02:05:04,295 --> 02:05:05,547
Nice shot.

1738
02:05:05,630 --> 02:05:09,092
- That tank is definitely dead now. - All right, let's go! We got business!

1739
02:05:19,602 --> 02:05:20,645
Hey!

1740
02:05:24,107 --> 02:05:27,569
Hey! I'm over here!

1741
02:05:39,914 --> 02:05:41,624
We've got the boy.

1742
02:05:46,212 --> 02:05:47,630
Watch out!

1743
02:05:48,006 --> 02:05:49,215
Missile!

1744
02:05:59,684 --> 02:06:01,144
Hang on, Sam!

1745
02:06:09,861 --> 02:06:11,196
No! No!

1746
02:06:16,910 --> 02:06:21,956
Is it fear or courage that compels you, fleshling?

1747
02:06:35,512 --> 02:06:36,971
Where do I go?

1748
02:06:38,306 --> 02:06:42,268
Give me the All Spark and you may live to be my pet.

1749
02:06:43,561 --> 02:06:45,188
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1750
02:06:49,359 --> 02:06:51,820
I'm never giving you this All Spark!

1751
02:06:51,945 --> 02:06:54,739
Oh, so unwise.

1752
02:07:06,710 --> 02:07:08,169
I got you, boy.

1753
02:07:10,005 --> 02:07:11,798
Hold on to the Cube!

1754
02:07:31,484 --> 02:07:34,362
- Oh, no. Oh, no! - Disgusting.

1755
02:07:39,367 --> 02:07:40,368
Sam?

1756
02:07:44,664 --> 02:07:47,917
You risked your life to protect the Cube.

1757
02:07:48,626 --> 02:07:50,086
No sacrifice,

1758
02:07:51,463 --> 02:07:54,549
- no victory. - If I cannot defeat Megatron,

1759
02:07:54,883 --> 02:07:57,385
you must push the Cube into my chest.

1760
02:07:57,761 --> 02:08:00,972
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.

1761
02:08:01,431 --> 02:08:02,932
Get behind me.

1762
02:08:04,601 --> 02:08:07,187
It's you and me, Megatron.

1763
02:08:07,270 --> 02:08:10,231
No, it's just me, Prime.

1764
02:08:12,650 --> 02:08:17,781
At the end of this day, one shall stand, one shall fall.

1765
02:08:23,203 --> 02:08:28,041
You still fight for the weak! That is why you lose!

1766
02:08:47,185 --> 02:08:49,604
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.

1767
02:08:49,688 --> 02:08:52,148
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys. Targets will be marked.

1768
02:08:52,273 --> 02:08:53,274
Hey.

1769
02:08:54,484 --> 02:08:56,653
Bring the rain. All right?

1770
02:08:57,070 --> 02:08:59,072
All right, let's kill these things.

1771
02:09:01,032 --> 02:09:02,617
- Move, move, move! - Remember, aim low.

1772
02:09:02,701 --> 02:09:04,703
Armor's weak under the chest.

1773
02:09:14,796 --> 02:09:16,339
Target marked. Still waiting.

1774
02:09:16,464 --> 02:09:18,466
{Y:i}Time on target, 20 seconds.

1775
02:09:25,432 --> 02:09:27,517
F-22s, we're still waiting.

1776
02:09:32,772 --> 02:09:34,190
Move out!

1777
02:09:37,444 --> 02:09:38,695
Incoming!

1778
02:09:47,203 --> 02:09:49,330
{Y:i}Weapons armed. Status green.

1779
02:10:07,974 --> 02:10:09,809
Run! Move!

1780
02:10:17,317 --> 02:10:18,860
{Y:i}Second wave's on approach.

1781
02:10:22,364 --> 02:10:23,948
{Y:i}What is that? Break off!

1782
02:10:24,074 --> 02:10:26,534
{Y:i}- Copy. - It's either a massive amount of...

1783
02:10:35,251 --> 02:10:37,420
{Y:i}Two, get a lock! Pop that guy!

1784
02:10:41,508 --> 02:10:43,593
{Y:i}Stay on him. Keep him in your sights.

1785
02:10:43,968 --> 02:10:45,261
Take him out!

1786
02:10:59,484 --> 02:11:00,819
Two's down!

1787
02:11:10,286 --> 02:11:12,205
I'll kill you!

1788
02:11:12,288 --> 02:11:15,083
Mine! All Spark!

1789
02:11:16,042 --> 02:11:18,920
Sam! Put the Cube in my chest! Now!

1790
02:11:19,629 --> 02:11:20,630
Sam!

1791
02:11:21,506 --> 02:11:22,716
No, Sam!

1792
02:11:48,533 --> 02:11:49,701
Hold up.

1793
02:11:52,829 --> 02:11:55,790
You left me no choice, brother.

1794
02:12:05,383 --> 02:12:08,261
Sam, I owe you my life.

1795
02:12:09,387 --> 02:12:11,139
We are in your debt.

1796
02:12:30,658 --> 02:12:33,036
Prime, we couldn't save him.

1797
02:12:33,912 --> 02:12:35,205
Jazz.

1798
02:12:38,416 --> 02:12:40,627
We lost a great comrade

1799
02:12:41,961 --> 02:12:43,838
but gained new ones.

1800
02:12:44,089 --> 02:12:46,383
Thank you, all of you.

1801
02:12:46,716 --> 02:12:49,094
You honor us with your bravery.

1802
02:12:50,136 --> 02:12:52,097
Permission to speak, sir?

1803
02:12:52,597 --> 02:12:55,475
Permission granted, old friend.

1804
02:12:55,558 --> 02:12:57,060
You speak now?

1805
02:12:57,977 --> 02:13:00,063
I wish to stay with the boy.

1806
02:13:00,939 --> 02:13:02,774
If that is his choice.

1807
02:13:07,737 --> 02:13:08,738
Yes.

1808
02:13:29,426 --> 02:13:34,139
Gentlemen, the President has ordered Sector Seven be terminated

1809
02:13:34,681 --> 02:13:37,726
and the remains of the dead aliens disposed of.

1810
02:13:38,351 --> 02:13:41,646
{Y:i}The Laurentian Abyss is seven miles below sea level,

1811
02:13:41,771 --> 02:13:43,857
{Y:i}deepest place on our planet.

1812
02:13:44,107 --> 02:13:47,610
{Y:i}The massive depth and pressure there, coupled with subfreezing temperatures,

1813
02:13:47,736 --> 02:13:49,946
{Y:i}would crush and entomb them,

1814
02:13:51,740 --> 02:13:53,450
{Y:i}leaving no evidence.

1815
02:14:00,123 --> 02:14:04,502
{Y:i}With the All Spark gone, we cannot return life to our planet.

1816
02:14:06,254 --> 02:14:08,840
{Y:i}And fate has yielded its reward,

1817
02:14:10,383 --> 02:14:13,303
{Y:i}a new world to call home.

1818
02:14:19,559 --> 02:14:23,772
{Y:i}We live among its people now, hiding in plain sight,

1819
02:14:23,897 --> 02:14:26,649
{Y:i}but watching over them in secret,

1820
02:14:26,900 --> 02:14:29,444
{Y:i}waiting, protecting.

1821
02:14:30,862 --> 02:14:33,907
{Y:i}I have witnessed their capacity for courage.

1822
02:14:34,491 --> 02:14:37,494
{Y:i}And though we are worlds apart,

1823
02:14:37,619 --> 02:14:42,540
{Y:i}like us, there's more to them than meets the eye.

1824
02:14:44,084 --> 02:14:46,586
{Y:i}I am Optimus Prime

1825
02:14:47,003 --> 02:14:50,340
{Y:i}and I send this message to any surviving Autobots

1826
02:14:50,465 --> 02:14:53,468
{Y:i}taking refuge among the stars.

1827
02:14:54,511 --> 02:14:56,221
{Y:i}We are here.

1828
02:14:56,805 --> 02:14:58,807
{Y:i}We are waiting.

1829
02:15:18,118 --> 02:15:23,164
Can you shed any light on the recent, so-called alien activity in the area?

1830
02:15:26,167 --> 02:15:31,673
Do you know what? I think that if there was some sort of an alien

1831
02:15:32,257 --> 02:15:34,175
- infestation... - Yeah.

1832
02:15:34,551 --> 02:15:36,970
They, the government, would be the first to let you know.

1833
02:15:37,053 --> 02:15:38,722
The government would let us know.

1834
02:15:38,888 --> 02:15:40,515
- I mean, this is America. - Yeah.

1835
02:15:40,598 --> 02:15:43,059
You know, that's how we know we live in a free land,

1836
02:15:43,143 --> 02:15:44,769
because there's no secrets.

1837
02:15:44,894 --> 02:15:46,980
They'd say, "Hey! Duck and cover."

1838
02:15:57,032 --> 02:16:00,326
Your head is kind of a different size than it is on television.

1839
02:16:01,369 --> 02:16:06,583
