1
00:02:14,107 --> 00:02:16,063
Will!

2
00:02:16,547 --> 00:02:19,459
-Why is this happening? -I don't know.

3
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,777
You look beautiful.

4
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:27,338
It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.

5
00:02:27,427 --> 00:02:30,578
Make way! Let me through! How dare you!

6
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:34,023
Stand your men down at once. Do you hear me?

7
00:02:35,347 --> 00:02:38,145
Governor Weatherby Swann, it's been too long.

8
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:41,663
-Cutler Beckett? -It's Lord now, actually.

9
00:02:43,307 --> 00:02:48,381
Lord or not, you have no reason and no authority to arrest this man.

10
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:51,301
In fact, I do. Mr. Mercer?

11
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:57,023
The warrant for the arrest of one William Turner.

12
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:06,218
-This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann. -Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake.

13
00:03:06,307 --> 00:03:08,616
-Arrest her. -On what charges?

14
00:03:08,707 --> 00:03:12,222
Aha. Here's the one for William Turner.

15
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:16,266
And I have another one for a Mr. James Norrington.

16
00:03:16,347 --> 00:03:18,417
-Is he present? -What are the charges?

17
00:03:18,507 --> 00:03:22,056
Commodore Norrington resigned his commission some months ago.

18
00:03:22,147 --> 00:03:24,456
That wasn't the answer to the question I asked.

19
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:28,062
Lord Beckett. In the category of questions not answered...

20
00:03:28,147 --> 00:03:31,457
We are under the jurisdiction of the king's governor of Port Royal

21
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:34,220
and you will tell us what we are charged with.

22
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:37,424
The charge is "conspiring to set free

23
00:03:37,507 --> 00:03:41,056
a man convicted of crimes against the Crown and Empire

24
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:44,776
and condemned to death, for which the..."

25
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:48,382
For which the punishment, regrettably, is also death.

26
00:03:50,787 --> 00:03:53,779
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow.

27
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,778
Captain.

28
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,455
Captain Jack Sparrow.

29
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:02,306
Captain Jack Sparrow.

30
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:04,503
Yes, I thought you might.

31
00:04:06,227 --> 00:04:11,255
# Fifteen men on a dead man's chest

32
00:04:11,347 --> 00:04:15,977
# Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

33
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:21,187
# Drink and the devil had done for the rest

34
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:25,738
# Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

35
00:04:47,427 --> 00:04:49,497
Prisoners, come on!

36
00:06:23,547 --> 00:06:25,503
Sorry, mate.

37
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:30,584
Mind if we make a little side trip?

38
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:33,617
I didn't think so.

39
00:06:39,547 --> 00:06:43,301
-Not quite according to plan. -Complications arose, ensued,

40
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:45,343
were overcome.

41
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:50,017
-You got what you went in for, then? -Mm-hm.

42
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:55,304
Captain, I think the crew, meaning me as well,

43
00:06:55,387 --> 00:06:58,618
were expecting something a bit more... shiny,

44
00:06:58,707 --> 00:07:02,746
with the Isla de Muerta going pear-shaped, reclaimed by the sea with the treasure.

45
00:07:02,827 --> 00:07:05,261
And the Royal Navy chasing us around the Atlantic.

46
00:07:05,347 --> 00:07:07,941
-And the hurricane. - Aye.

47
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:13,545
All in all, it seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating.

48
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:17,505
-Shiny. -Aye, shiny.

49
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:20,498
Is that how you're all feeling?

50
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:25,707
That perhaps dear old Jack is not serving your best interests as captain?

51
00:07:25,787 --> 00:07:28,017
Walk the plank.

52
00:07:28,107 --> 00:07:30,985
-What did the bird say? -Do not blame the bird.

53
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:34,298
Show us what is on that piece of cloth there.

54
00:07:42,107 --> 00:07:45,543
-You know that don't do no good. - It does me.

55
00:07:47,427 --> 00:07:50,624
-It's a key. -No. Much more better.

56
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:54,466
It is a drawing of a key.

57
00:08:00,587 --> 00:08:02,418
Gentlemen,

58
00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:04,338
what do keys do?

59
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:07,104
Keys...

60
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,462
unlock things?

61
00:08:09,547 --> 00:08:13,222
And whatever this key unlocks, inside there's something valuable.

62
00:08:13,307 --> 00:08:16,424
So we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks.

63
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:18,065
No.

64
00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:22,341
If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever we don't have that it unlocks.

65
00:08:22,427 --> 00:08:26,136
So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked,

66
00:08:26,227 --> 00:08:30,505
which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?

67
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:32,817
So we're going after this key.

68
00:08:33,707 --> 00:08:36,096
You're not making any sense at all.

69
00:08:36,587 --> 00:08:38,464
Any more questions?

70
00:08:38,547 --> 00:08:40,981
So... do we have a heading?

71
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:43,137
Ha. A heading.

72
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:47,377
Set sail in a...

73
00:08:48,387 --> 00:08:50,264
general...

74
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:56,624
that-way direction.

75
00:08:56,707 --> 00:08:57,822
Captain?

76
00:08:57,907 --> 00:09:02,458
Come on, snap to and make sail. You know how this works. Go on. Oi, oi, oi!

77
00:09:05,827 --> 00:09:08,057
Have you noticed lately

78
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:12,584
the captain seems to be acting a bit strange... er?

79
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:15,340
Setting sail without knowing his own heading.

80
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:18,305
Something's got Jack vexed, and mark my words,

81
00:09:18,387 --> 00:09:22,096
what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow bodes ill for us all.

82
00:09:35,787 --> 00:09:38,176
Lord Beckett, the prisoner as ordered, sir.

83
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:40,497
Those won't be necessary.

84
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:48,697
The East India Trading Company has need of your services.

85
00:09:52,547 --> 00:09:54,503
We wish for you to act as our agent

86
00:09:54,587 --> 00:09:58,546
in a business transaction with our mutual friend Captain Sparrow.

87
00:09:58,627 --> 00:10:00,902
More acquaintance. How do you know him?

88
00:10:00,987 --> 00:10:03,820
We've had dealings in the past.

89
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:08,216
And we've each left our mark on the other.

90
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,582
What mark did he leave on you?

91
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:16,742
By your efforts, Jack Sparrow was set free.

92
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:18,783
I would like you to go to him

93
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:23,224
and recover a certain property in his possession.

94
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:25,946
Recover. At the point of a sword?

95
00:10:26,507 --> 00:10:28,418
Bargain.

96
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:36,497
Letters of marque.

97
00:10:37,707 --> 00:10:40,175
You will offer what amounts to a full pardon.

98
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:44,340
Jack will be free, a privateer in the employ of England.

99
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:49,657
Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment the same as being free.

100
00:10:49,747 --> 00:10:51,738
Freedom.

101
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:55,858
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.

102
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,744
The world is shrinking,

103
00:10:57,827 --> 00:11:01,103
the blank edges of the map filled in.

104
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:04,896
Jack must find his place in the New World or perish.

105
00:11:04,987 --> 00:11:07,660
Not unlike you, Mr. Turner.

106
00:11:07,747 --> 00:11:10,466
You and your fiancée face the hangman's noose.

107
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:15,698
-So you get Jack and the Black Pearl. -The Black Pearl?

108
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:19,826
-The property you want that he possesses. -A ship? Hardly.

109
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:23,820
The item in question is considerably smaller and far more valuable,

110
00:11:23,907 --> 00:11:27,343
something Sparrow keeps on his person at all times.

111
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:29,941
A compass?

112
00:11:30,027 --> 00:11:32,097
Ah, you know it.

113
00:11:33,387 --> 00:11:37,585
Bring back that compass or there's no deal.

114
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:04,177
Why is the rum always gone?

115
00:12:09,907 --> 00:12:12,296
Oh.

116
00:12:12,387 --> 00:12:14,855
That's why.

117
00:12:20,627 --> 00:12:22,538
As you were, gents.

118
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,378
Ah.

119
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:58,098
Time's run out, Jack.

120
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:18,381
Bootstrap.

121
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:20,537
Bill Turner.

122
00:13:25,107 --> 00:13:27,382
You look good, Jack.

123
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:35,983
Is this a dream?

124
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,420
No.

125
00:13:37,507 --> 00:13:40,943
I thought not. If it were, there'd be rum.

126
00:13:48,507 --> 00:13:50,896
You got the Pearl back, I see.

127
00:13:51,587 --> 00:13:55,262
I had some help retrieving the Pearl, by the way.

128
00:13:56,347 --> 00:13:58,736
Your son.

129
00:13:58,827 --> 00:14:01,182
William?

130
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,216
He ended up a pirate after all.

131
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:08,815
And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?

132
00:14:08,907 --> 00:14:10,977
He sent me.

133
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:14,827
Davy Jones.

134
00:14:14,907 --> 00:14:17,375
Oh.

135
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:19,378
So it's you, then.

136
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:24,104
He shanghaied you into service, eh?

137
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:26,098
I chose it.

138
00:14:26,187 --> 00:14:30,977
I'm sorry for the part I played in the mutiny against you, Jack.

139
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:34,181
I stood up for you.

140
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:37,065
Everything went wrong after that.

141
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:43,297
They strapped me to a cannon. I ended up on the bottom of the ocean,

142
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:46,185
the weight of the water crushing down on me.

143
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:48,701
Unable to move.

144
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:51,902
Unable to die, Jack.

145
00:14:51,987 --> 00:14:57,345
And I thought that even the tiniest hope of escaping this fate, I would take it.

146
00:14:57,907 --> 00:15:00,057
I would trade anything for it.

147
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,139
It's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment.

148
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:07,787
You made a deal with him too, Jack.

149
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:10,381
He raised the Pearl from the depths for you.

150
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:12,458
13 years, you've been her captain.

151
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:14,378
-Technically... -Jack.

152
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:16,776
You won't be able to talk yourself out of this.

153
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:19,506
The terms what applied to me apply to you as well.

154
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:23,739
One soul bound to crew 100 years upon his ship.

155
00:15:23,827 --> 00:15:26,136
The Flying Dutchman already has a captain...

156
00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:28,457
Then it's the locker for you!

157
00:15:28,547 --> 00:15:31,619
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you

158
00:15:31,707 --> 00:15:35,859
and drag the Pearl back to the depths and you along with it.

159
00:15:36,747 --> 00:15:41,138
Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?

160
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,898
I already told you, Jack.

161
00:15:45,787 --> 00:15:48,017
Your time is up.

162
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:50,823
It comes now,

163
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:56,027
drawn with ravenous hunger to the man what bears the black spot.

164
00:16:04,787 --> 00:16:07,904
On deck, all hands! Make fast the bunt gasket!

165
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:10,182
On deck! Scurry!

166
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:14,658
Scurry! I want movement! Movement! I want movement!

167
00:16:14,747 --> 00:16:18,342
Lift the skin up! Keep your loof! Haul those sheets!

168
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:22,659
Run them! Run! Keep running! Run as if the devil himself and itself is upon us!

169
00:16:22,747 --> 00:16:25,978
-Do we have a heading? -Argh! Run! Land.

170
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:34,456
-Which port? -I didn't say "port", I said "land". Any land.

171
00:16:40,587 --> 00:16:43,659
-Jack's hat! Bring her about! - No, no!

172
00:16:43,747 --> 00:16:45,942
Leave it!

173
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,902
Run.

174
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:52,705
Back to your stations, the lot of you!

175
00:17:00,907 --> 00:17:02,499
-Jack? -Shh.

176
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:07,820
For the love of mother and child, Jack, what's coming after us?

177
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:09,579
Nothing.

178
00:18:19,947 --> 00:18:24,020
-Here, now, you can't be here. -I think you'll find he can.

179
00:18:24,107 --> 00:18:25,506
Mr. Swann!

180
00:18:25,587 --> 00:18:27,578
Governor Swann, still.

181
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:30,784
Do you think I wear this wig to keep my head warm?

182
00:18:30,867 --> 00:18:34,337
Jack's compass? What does Beckett want with that?

183
00:18:34,427 --> 00:18:38,420
Does it matter? I'm to find Jack and convince him to return to Port Royal.

184
00:18:38,507 --> 00:18:40,941
In exchange, the charges against us will be dropped.

185
00:18:41,027 --> 00:18:44,542
No. We must find our own avenue to secure your freedom.

186
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:47,061
Is that a lack of faith in Jack or in me?

187
00:18:47,147 --> 00:18:49,342
That you would risk your life to save Sparrow

188
00:18:49,427 --> 00:18:53,181
does not mean he would do the same for anyone else.

189
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:56,543
Now, where is that dog with the keys?

190
00:18:57,987 --> 00:19:00,421
I have faith in you.

191
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:03,021
Both of you.

192
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:07,061
Where will you find him?

193
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:11,698
Tortuga. I'll start there and I won't stop searching till I find him.

194
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:15,383
And then I intend to return here to marry you.

195
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:18,664
-Properly? -Eagerly, if you'll still have me.

196
00:19:19,707 --> 00:19:23,586
If it weren't for these bars, I'd have you already.

197
00:19:29,787 --> 00:19:34,144
-I'll wait for you. -Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

198
00:19:43,227 --> 00:19:45,297
Captain Jack Sparrow?

199
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:50,505
Owes me four doubloons. Heard he was dead.

200
00:19:50,587 --> 00:19:54,262
Singapore. That's what I heard. Drunk, with a smile on his face.

201
00:19:54,347 --> 00:19:58,545
Sure as the tide, Jack Sparrow turn up in Singapore.

202
00:19:58,627 --> 00:20:00,538
Jack Sparrow?

203
00:20:00,627 --> 00:20:02,618
I haven't seen him in a month.

204
00:20:02,707 --> 00:20:06,336
When you find him, will you give him a message?

205
00:20:07,347 --> 00:20:09,781
Can't say about Jack Sparrow,

206
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:12,427
but there's an island just south of the straits

207
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:14,737
where I trade spice for...

208
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:17,341
mm, delicious long pork.

209
00:20:18,907 --> 00:20:22,820
Cannot say about Jack, but you'll find a ship there.

210
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:25,137
A ship with black sails.

211
00:20:32,307 --> 00:20:34,138
My brother will take you ashore.

212
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:47,340
-What's wrong? The beach is there. -C'est trop dangereux.

213
00:20:47,427 --> 00:20:50,737
-What? -C'est trop dangereux, je vous l'avais dit.

214
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:54,103
Bon voyage, monsieur.

215
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:20,456
Jack!

216
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:22,458
Jack Sparrow!

217
00:21:28,147 --> 00:21:30,058
Marty!

218
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:32,539
Cotton!

219
00:21:33,467 --> 00:21:35,378
Anybody?

220
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,981
-Ah. A familiar face. -

221
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:44,785
Don't eat me.

222
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:47,745
-I'm not going to eat you. -Don't eat me.

223
00:21:47,827 --> 00:21:50,295
No. Don't eat me.

224
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:02,698
Gibbs.

225
00:22:31,707 --> 00:22:33,663
Come on! Let's go!

226
00:22:36,587 --> 00:22:38,384
Come on! Who wants it?

227
00:22:41,107 --> 00:22:43,337
I can do this all day!

228
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:46,546
Jack?

229
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:48,936
Jack Sparrow!

230
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,495
I can honestly say I'm glad to see you.

231
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:01,784
Jack, it's me.

232
00:24:01,867 --> 00:24:03,095
Will Turner.

233
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:12,982
-Tell them to let me down! -

234
00:24:13,747 --> 00:24:15,658
...eensy-weensy.

235
00:24:21,467 --> 00:24:25,176
...eunuchy. Snip, snip. -

236
00:24:25,267 --> 00:24:27,417
Eunuchy.

237
00:24:30,147 --> 00:24:32,502
Jack, the compass. That's all I need.

238
00:24:32,587 --> 00:24:35,545
Elizabeth is in danger. We were arrested for helping you.

239
00:24:35,627 --> 00:24:37,857
She faces the gallows!

240
00:24:45,187 --> 00:24:46,905
Savvy?

241
00:24:52,947 --> 00:24:55,256
Save me.

242
00:24:55,347 --> 00:24:57,338
Jack, what did you tell them?

243
00:24:57,427 --> 00:24:59,383
No!

244
00:24:59,787 --> 00:25:01,982
What about Elizabeth?

245
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,580
Jack!

246
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:08,457
That's a good girl. Come a little closer.

247
00:25:08,547 --> 00:25:12,745
-We don't bite. -Go on. We won't bite you.

248
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:17,615
Come quickly.

249
00:25:17,707 --> 00:25:20,858
-Tell me what's happening. -Our name still has some standing.

250
00:25:20,947 --> 00:25:24,144
I've arranged passage to England. The captain is a friend of mine.

251
00:25:24,227 --> 00:25:26,297
No! Will's gone to find Jack!

252
00:25:26,387 --> 00:25:28,343
We cannot count on William Turner.

253
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:31,464
-Come! -He's better than you give him credit for.

254
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:34,823
This is no time for innocence. Beckett has offered one pardon only -

255
00:25:34,907 --> 00:25:37,137
one, and that is promised to Jack Sparrow.

256
00:25:37,227 --> 00:25:38,865
Even if Will succeeds,

257
00:25:38,947 --> 00:25:44,783
do not ask me to endure the sight of my daughter walking to the gallows. Do not.

258
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:49,099
Perhaps I can ensure a fair trial for Will if he returns.

259
00:25:49,187 --> 00:25:54,056
-A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging. -Then there is nothing left for you here.

260
00:25:57,947 --> 00:25:59,858
Whoa!

261
00:26:00,907 --> 00:26:02,977
Wait inside.

262
00:26:04,027 --> 00:26:05,938
Captain?

263
00:26:08,347 --> 00:26:10,258
Captain.

264
00:26:15,827 --> 00:26:18,057
Evening, Governor.

265
00:26:18,147 --> 00:26:20,058
Shame, that.

266
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:22,183
He was carrying this.

267
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:24,861
It's a letter to the king.

268
00:26:24,947 --> 00:26:27,177
-It's from you. -No...

269
00:26:30,427 --> 00:26:32,543
Elizabeth.

270
00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:35,502
What are you doing?

271
00:26:38,107 --> 00:26:40,496
-Where is she? -Who?

272
00:26:57,507 --> 00:27:01,546
No doubt you've discovered that loyalty is no longer the currency of the realm,

273
00:27:01,627 --> 00:27:03,822
as your father believes.

274
00:27:04,587 --> 00:27:07,147
Then what is?

275
00:27:07,227 --> 00:27:10,344
I'm afraid currency is the currency of the realm.

276
00:27:10,427 --> 00:27:15,501
I expect, then, we can come to some sort of understanding.

277
00:27:15,587 --> 00:27:18,659
-I'm here to negotiate. -I'm listening.

278
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:23,302
I'm listening intently.

279
00:27:25,107 --> 00:27:27,416
These letters of marque are signed by the king.

280
00:27:27,507 --> 00:27:32,058
Yes, and they're not valid until they bear my signature and my seal.

281
00:27:32,147 --> 00:27:34,741
Or else I would not still be here.

282
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:38,706
You sent Will to get you the compass owned by Jack Sparrow.

283
00:27:38,787 --> 00:27:42,336
-It will do you no good. -Do explain.

284
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:47,023
I have been to the Isla de Muerta. I have seen the treasure myself.

285
00:27:47,107 --> 00:27:49,098
There is something you need to know.

286
00:27:49,187 --> 00:27:51,178
Ah, I see.

287
00:27:51,267 --> 00:27:54,259
You think the compass leads only to the Isla de Muerta

288
00:27:54,347 --> 00:27:57,384
and so you hope to save me from an evil fate.

289
00:27:58,067 --> 00:28:00,422
But you mustn't worry.

290
00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:04,178
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.

291
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:06,656
My desires are not so provincial.

292
00:28:07,347 --> 00:28:11,465
There's more than one chest of value in these waters.

293
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:16,546
So perhaps you may wish to enhance your offer.

294
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:23,583
Consider into your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night.

295
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,737
So I did.

296
00:28:27,587 --> 00:28:29,817
A marriage interrupted...

297
00:28:32,027 --> 00:28:34,621
or fate intervenes?

298
00:28:35,307 --> 00:28:38,458
You're making great efforts to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.

299
00:28:38,547 --> 00:28:40,981
-These aren't going to Jack. -Oh, really?

300
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:43,706
To ensure Mr. Turner's freedom, then,

301
00:28:44,547 --> 00:28:47,186
I'll still want that compass.

302
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,737
Consider that in your calculations.

303
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:12,505
I say it was Divine Providence what escaped us from jail.

304
00:29:12,587 --> 00:29:15,181
And I say it was me being clever.

305
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,855
Ain't that right, poochie?

306
00:29:18,947 --> 00:29:22,940
Well, how'd you know it weren't Divine Providence what inspired you to be clever?

307
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:25,097
Anyways, I ain't stealing no ship.

308
00:29:25,187 --> 00:29:30,261
It ain't stealing. It's salvaging. And since when did you care?

309
00:29:30,347 --> 00:29:34,784
Since we're not immortal no more. We gotta take care of our immortal souls.

310
00:29:34,867 --> 00:29:38,496
-You know you can't read. -It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.

311
00:29:38,587 --> 00:29:43,820
Pretending to read the Bible's a lie. That's a mark against...

312
00:29:45,627 --> 00:29:47,265
Look.

313
00:29:47,347 --> 00:29:49,338
There it is.

314
00:29:53,827 --> 00:29:55,783
What's got into him?

315
00:29:55,867 --> 00:29:57,903
Must have seen a catfish.

316
00:30:04,787 --> 00:30:06,857
Stupid mongrel!

317
00:30:13,307 --> 00:30:15,218
Argh!

318
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:23,625
Come on!

319
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:34,860
-It's ours for the taking. -Tide's coming in. That should help.

320
00:30:34,947 --> 00:30:37,620
And salvaging is saving, in a manner of speaking.

321
00:30:37,707 --> 00:30:39,504
There's the truth of it!

322
00:30:46,747 --> 00:30:49,625
Suppose we better save it as soon as we can,

323
00:30:49,707 --> 00:30:52,779
what with our souls in such a vulnerable state and all.

324
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:55,427
Amen to that.

325
00:31:10,947 --> 00:31:12,903
Thank you.

326
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:32,218
Why would he do this to us? If Jack is the chief...

327
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,662
Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack their chief,

328
00:31:34,747 --> 00:31:38,183
but he only remains chief as long as he acts like a chief.

329
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:41,259
So he had no choice. He's a captive as much as the rest of us.

330
00:31:41,347 --> 00:31:47,786
Worse, as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos believe that Jack is a god in human form,

331
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:53,737
and they intend to do him the honor of releasing him from his fleshy prison.

332
00:31:57,107 --> 00:31:59,462
They'll roast him and eat him.

333
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:02,185
Where's the rest of the crew?

334
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:06,658
These cages we're in weren't built till after we got here.

335
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:10,983
The feast is about to begin.

336
00:32:11,547 --> 00:32:13,663
Jack's life will end

337
00:32:13,747 --> 00:32:15,977
when the drums stop.

338
00:32:17,627 --> 00:32:20,141
Well, we can't just sit here and wait, then, can we?

339
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:25,027
No, no. Oi! No, no.

340
00:32:25,107 --> 00:32:28,099
More wood. Big fire. Big fire.

341
00:32:28,187 --> 00:32:30,223
I am Chief. Want big fire.

342
00:32:30,307 --> 00:32:32,423
Come on.

343
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:35,701
Oi. Tout de suite.

344
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,017
Come on. More wood.

345
00:33:03,867 --> 00:33:05,778
Whoa!

346
00:33:43,667 --> 00:33:45,578
Oh, bugger.

347
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,937
A little seasoning, eh?

348
00:34:10,187 --> 00:34:11,745
Well done.

349
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:52,698
Put your legs through. Start to climb!

350
00:34:53,707 --> 00:34:57,700
Come on, men! It'll take all of us to crew the Black Pearl!

351
00:34:57,787 --> 00:35:00,426
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone.

352
00:35:00,507 --> 00:35:02,737
About six would do.

353
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,905
Oh, dear.

354
00:35:11,227 --> 00:35:13,787
-Hurry! -Come on!

355
00:35:17,387 --> 00:35:19,696
Come on! Is that all you got?

356
00:35:27,027 --> 00:35:29,461
-Wait. Stop. -Eh?

357
00:35:29,947 --> 00:35:32,177
Stop. Shh.

358
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:40,978
Shh.

359
00:35:43,747 --> 00:35:46,056
- What are they doing? -Stop.

360
00:35:52,507 --> 00:35:54,975
-Snake! -

361
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:12,659
Move!

362
00:36:37,787 --> 00:36:40,984
Well, go on, go get them.

363
00:36:45,227 --> 00:36:47,377
No, no. Oi! No, no!

364
00:36:49,627 --> 00:36:51,219
Not good.

365
00:37:06,827 --> 00:37:08,977
Cut it loose! Find a rock!

366
00:37:27,187 --> 00:37:28,905
Roll the cage!

367
00:37:28,987 --> 00:37:31,262
Come on!

368
00:37:54,787 --> 00:37:59,542
-Lift the cage! Hurry! -Come on, lads. Lift it like a lady's skirt.

369
00:38:53,427 --> 00:38:54,746
Run!

370
00:39:07,907 --> 00:39:10,546
This way, lads!

371
00:39:32,147 --> 00:39:33,626
Take cover!

372
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,226
Stop it!

373
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,380
Bugger.

374
00:40:56,867 --> 00:40:59,427
Haul loose the mooring line!

375
00:40:59,507 --> 00:41:01,657
The mooring line!

376
00:41:01,747 --> 00:41:05,262
Thief! Little hairy thief! Give it back!

377
00:41:05,347 --> 00:41:08,544
-Don't bite it! - Haul loose the mooring line!

378
00:41:09,027 --> 00:41:11,063
He's got me eye. He won't give it back.

379
00:41:11,147 --> 00:41:14,457
-How'd you get it back last time? -Excellent! Our work's half done.

380
00:41:14,547 --> 00:41:16,936
We done it for you, knowing you'd be coming back.

381
00:41:17,027 --> 00:41:19,825
-Make ready to sail, boys! -What about Jack?

382
00:41:19,907 --> 00:41:23,138
-I won't leave without him. - Oi!

383
00:41:30,907 --> 00:41:33,785
-Time to go. -Cast off those lines!

384
00:41:38,987 --> 00:41:41,785
Aaargh!

385
00:41:42,187 --> 00:41:45,065
-Make ready to cast off! -Oi!

386
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:50,742
Good doggy.

387
00:42:05,507 --> 00:42:11,582
Alas, my children, this is the day you shall always remember as the day you almost...

388
00:42:14,547 --> 00:42:16,663
Captain Jack Sparrow.

389
00:42:41,387 --> 00:42:44,345
Let's get away from this island and head out to open sea.

390
00:42:44,427 --> 00:42:48,739
Yes to the first. Yes to the second, but only insofar as we keep to the shallows.

391
00:42:48,827 --> 00:42:50,863
That seems a bit contradictory, Captain.

392
00:42:50,947 --> 00:42:53,984
I have faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills.

393
00:42:54,067 --> 00:42:57,025
Now, where is that monkey? I want to shoot something.

394
00:43:02,467 --> 00:43:04,742
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.

395
00:43:04,827 --> 00:43:07,500
Have you considered just locking her up somewhere?

396
00:43:07,587 --> 00:43:10,021
She is locked up, bound to hang for helping you.

397
00:43:10,107 --> 00:43:14,897
There comes a time when one must take responsibility for one's mistakes.

398
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:18,416
I need that compass of yours, Jack.

399
00:43:18,507 --> 00:43:20,975
I must trade it for her freedom.

400
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:25,747
-Mr. Gibbs. -Captain.

401
00:43:25,827 --> 00:43:28,739
We have a need to travel upriver.

402
00:43:28,827 --> 00:43:32,183
By need, do you mean a trifling need?

403
00:43:32,267 --> 00:43:35,896
Fleeting? As in, say, a passing fancy?

404
00:43:35,987 --> 00:43:39,616
No, a resolute and unyielding need.

405
00:43:39,707 --> 00:43:43,336
What we need to do is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.

406
00:43:43,427 --> 00:43:45,258
William,

407
00:43:45,347 --> 00:43:47,303
I shall trade you the compass

408
00:43:47,387 --> 00:43:49,139
if you will help me

409
00:43:49,227 --> 00:43:51,297
to find this.

410
00:43:54,827 --> 00:43:57,216
-You want me to find this? -No.

411
00:43:58,307 --> 00:44:00,662
You want you to find this,

412
00:44:00,747 --> 00:44:04,660
because the finding of this finds you incapacitorially finding

413
00:44:04,747 --> 00:44:11,186
and/or locating in your discovering a way to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face.

414
00:44:11,267 --> 00:44:13,986
Savvy?

415
00:44:15,467 --> 00:44:17,901
This is going to save Elizabeth?

416
00:44:20,107 --> 00:44:23,065
How much do you know about Davy Jones?

417
00:44:25,187 --> 00:44:26,700
Not much.

418
00:44:26,787 --> 00:44:29,665
Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.

419
00:44:54,907 --> 00:44:57,467
What's all this?

420
00:44:57,987 --> 00:45:02,822
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have to share and wear it one after the other.

421
00:45:02,907 --> 00:45:06,104
It's not like that, sir. This ship is haunted.

422
00:45:06,627 --> 00:45:08,822
Is it, now? And you?

423
00:45:08,907 --> 00:45:12,866
There's a female presence amongst us here, sir.

424
00:45:12,947 --> 00:45:15,336
All the men, they can feel it.

425
00:45:15,427 --> 00:45:19,022
It's the ghost of a lady widowed before her marriage, I figure it,

426
00:45:19,107 --> 00:45:21,302
searching for her husband, lost at sea.

427
00:45:21,387 --> 00:45:23,855
A virgin too, likely as not.

428
00:45:23,947 --> 00:45:26,097
And that bodes ill by all accounts.

429
00:45:26,187 --> 00:45:30,499
I say that we throw the dress overboard and we hope the spirit follows it.

430
00:45:30,587 --> 00:45:33,306
No! That will just anger the spirit, sir.

431
00:45:33,387 --> 00:45:37,266
What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs, and then get it back to her.

432
00:45:37,347 --> 00:45:39,497
Enough! Enough!

433
00:45:39,587 --> 00:45:43,705
You're a pair of superstitious goats and it's got the best of you.

434
00:45:43,787 --> 00:45:46,859
Now, this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway on board.

435
00:45:46,947 --> 00:45:49,017
A young woman, by the look of it.

436
00:45:49,107 --> 00:45:51,621
I want you to search the ship and find her.

437
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:54,346
Oh, and, er... she's probably naked.

438
00:46:23,027 --> 00:46:25,541
Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?

439
00:46:25,627 --> 00:46:27,902
Well, if you believe such things,

440
00:46:28,387 --> 00:46:31,060
there's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones -

441
00:46:31,147 --> 00:46:35,538
a fearsome creature with giant tentacles that'll suction your face clean off

442
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:39,097
and drag an entire ship down to the crushing darkness.

443
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:42,737
The kraken.

444
00:46:44,907 --> 00:46:48,661
They say the stench of its breath is like...

445
00:46:48,747 --> 00:46:52,103
Imagine, the last thing you know on God's green earth

446
00:46:52,187 --> 00:46:57,898
is the roar of the kraken and the reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses.

447
00:46:59,707 --> 00:47:02,096
If you believe such things.

448
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:04,896
And the key will spare him that?

449
00:47:04,987 --> 00:47:08,343
Well, that's the very question Jack wants answered.

450
00:47:08,427 --> 00:47:10,816
Bad enough even to go visit...

451
00:47:11,707 --> 00:47:13,777
her.

452
00:47:13,867 --> 00:47:15,664
Her?

453
00:47:15,747 --> 00:47:17,658
Aye.

454
00:47:51,227 --> 00:47:54,776
No worries, mates. Tia Dalma and I go way back.

455
00:47:54,867 --> 00:47:58,655
Thick as thieves. Nigh inseparable, we are.

456
00:47:58,747 --> 00:48:00,977
Were. Have been.

457
00:48:02,107 --> 00:48:03,096
Before.

458
00:48:03,187 --> 00:48:06,020
-I'll watch your back. -It's me front I'm worried about.

459
00:48:06,107 --> 00:48:08,496
-Mind the boat. -Mind the boat.

460
00:48:09,307 --> 00:48:11,775
-Mind the boat. -Mind the boat.

461
00:48:11,867 --> 00:48:13,858
-Mind the boat. -

462
00:48:13,947 --> 00:48:16,017
Mind the boat.

463
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:30,455
Jack Sparrow.

464
00:48:30,544 --> 00:48:32,580
Tia Dalma.

465
00:48:33,344 --> 00:48:37,735
I always knew the wind was going to blow you back to me one day.

466
00:48:42,224 --> 00:48:44,101
You...

467
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:48,938
You have a touch of...

468
00:48:49,024 --> 00:48:52,255
destiny about you,

469
00:48:52,344 --> 00:48:54,141
William Turner.

470
00:48:55,824 --> 00:48:57,894
You know me?

471
00:48:57,984 --> 00:49:00,498
You want to know me.

472
00:49:00,584 --> 00:49:05,021
There'll be no knowing here. We've come for help and we're not leaving without it.

473
00:49:05,104 --> 00:49:08,619
-I thought I knew you. -Not so well as I had hoped.

474
00:49:08,704 --> 00:49:10,774
-Come. -Come.

475
00:49:14,344 --> 00:49:18,656
What service may I do you?

476
00:49:19,344 --> 00:49:23,132
-You know I demand payment. -I brought payment.

477
00:49:26,584 --> 00:49:28,495
Look.

478
00:49:29,624 --> 00:49:31,933
An undead monkey.

479
00:49:32,024 --> 00:49:34,094
Top that.

480
00:49:37,864 --> 00:49:41,618
Don't! You've no idea how long it took us to catch that.

481
00:49:42,064 --> 00:49:44,453
The payment is fair.

482
00:49:44,544 --> 00:49:46,455
We're looking for this.

483
00:49:48,904 --> 00:49:51,623
And what it goes to.

484
00:49:53,024 --> 00:49:57,495
The compass you bartered from me, it cannot lead you to this?

485
00:49:57,584 --> 00:50:00,860
Maybe. Why?

486
00:50:00,944 --> 00:50:03,174
I hear you.

487
00:50:03,264 --> 00:50:07,542
Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants.

488
00:50:08,144 --> 00:50:10,339
Or do you know,

489
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:14,178
but are loath to claim it as your own?

490
00:50:15,824 --> 00:50:17,780
Your key go to a chest.

491
00:50:18,344 --> 00:50:22,701
And it is what lay inside the chest you seek, don't it?

492
00:50:22,784 --> 00:50:25,582
-What is inside? -Gold?

493
00:50:25,664 --> 00:50:29,577
Jewels? Unclaimed properties of a valuable nature?

494
00:50:29,664 --> 00:50:32,701
Nothing bad, I hope?

495
00:50:33,424 --> 00:50:36,177
You know of Davy Jones,

496
00:50:36,264 --> 00:50:37,743
yes?

497
00:50:37,824 --> 00:50:40,497
A man of the sea.

498
00:50:40,584 --> 00:50:42,779
A great sailor,

499
00:50:42,864 --> 00:50:47,654
until he run afoul of that which vex all men.

500
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:50,622
What vexes all men?

501
00:50:52,104 --> 00:50:54,493
What indeed?

502
00:50:55,024 --> 00:50:56,935
-The sea. -Sums.

503
00:50:57,024 --> 00:50:59,902
The dichotomy of good and evil.

504
00:51:00,504 --> 00:51:02,142
A woman.

505
00:51:02,424 --> 00:51:03,982
A woman.

506
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:06,055
He fell in love.

507
00:51:06,144 --> 00:51:08,977
No, no, no, no. I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.

508
00:51:09,064 --> 00:51:12,852
Same story, different versions, and all are true.

509
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:15,219
See, it was a woman

510
00:51:15,304 --> 00:51:17,943
as changing and harsh

511
00:51:18,024 --> 00:51:21,300
and untamable as the sea.

512
00:51:21,384 --> 00:51:23,693
Him never stopped loving her.

513
00:51:23,784 --> 00:51:28,380
But the pain it cause him was too much to live with

514
00:51:28,464 --> 00:51:31,058
but not enough to cause him to die.

515
00:51:32,744 --> 00:51:37,022
What exactly did he put into the chest?

516
00:51:37,104 --> 00:51:38,981
Him heart.

517
00:51:39,064 --> 00:51:41,055
Literally or figuratively?

518
00:51:41,144 --> 00:51:45,501
He couldn't literally put his heart in a chest.

519
00:51:45,584 --> 00:51:47,495
Could he?

520
00:51:47,584 --> 00:51:53,420
It was not worth feeling what small, fleeting joy life brings.

521
00:51:53,504 --> 00:51:55,096
And so...

522
00:51:55,184 --> 00:51:57,778
him carve out him heart,

523
00:51:58,344 --> 00:52:02,860
lock it away in a chest and hide the chest from the world.

524
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:05,695
The key

525
00:52:05,784 --> 00:52:10,141
he keep with him at all times.

526
00:52:10,744 --> 00:52:14,293
-You knew this. -I did not. I didn't know where the key was.

527
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:18,423
But now we do. All that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key,

528
00:52:18,504 --> 00:52:21,143
you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, eh?

529
00:52:21,224 --> 00:52:23,977
Let me see your hand.

530
00:52:36,984 --> 00:52:39,373
The black spot!

531
00:52:40,384 --> 00:52:43,774
- The black spot! - Black spot!

532
00:52:44,184 --> 00:52:47,142
My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know.

533
00:52:47,224 --> 00:52:50,534
I have just the thing. Now, where did I put it?

534
00:52:53,864 --> 00:52:57,220
My little beauty, where are you?

535
00:52:57,304 --> 00:53:00,694
Such a long time in such a mess.

536
00:53:02,664 --> 00:53:05,417
Davy Jones cannot make port.

537
00:53:05,504 --> 00:53:08,701
Cannot step on land but once every ten years.

538
00:53:09,224 --> 00:53:12,341
Land is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow,

539
00:53:12,424 --> 00:53:14,858
and so you will carry land with you.

540
00:53:23,744 --> 00:53:25,655
Dirt.

541
00:53:26,744 --> 00:53:30,259
-This is a jar of dirt. -Yes.

542
00:53:32,504 --> 00:53:35,257
Is the jar of dirt going to help?

543
00:53:35,344 --> 00:53:38,142
If you don't want it, give it back.

544
00:53:38,624 --> 00:53:41,661
-No. -Then it helps.

545
00:53:43,784 --> 00:53:48,619
It seems we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman.

546
00:53:51,624 --> 00:53:55,299
A touch of destiny.

547
00:54:10,144 --> 00:54:12,578
That's the Flying Dutchman?

548
00:54:14,424 --> 00:54:17,097
-She doesn't look like much. -Neither do you.

549
00:54:17,184 --> 00:54:19,414
Do not underestimate her.

550
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:25,056
-Must have run afoul of the reef. -So, what's your plan, then?

551
00:54:25,144 --> 00:54:28,454
I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key.

552
00:54:28,544 --> 00:54:30,819
And if there are crewmen?

553
00:54:30,904 --> 00:54:33,054
I cut down anyone in my path.

554
00:54:33,864 --> 00:54:36,662
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.

555
00:54:36,744 --> 00:54:40,703
Your chariot awaits you, Sire.

556
00:54:42,744 --> 00:54:43,859
Oi!

557
00:54:43,944 --> 00:54:49,462
If you do happen to get captured, just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt.

558
00:54:49,544 --> 00:54:53,298
-It might save your life. - Bon voyage!

559
00:54:57,104 --> 00:54:59,572
Douse the lamps.

560
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:40,579
Sailor.

561
00:55:40,664 --> 00:55:43,132
-Hoisting the jib, Captain's orders. -Sailor!

562
00:55:43,224 --> 00:55:45,499
Hoisting the jib. Bring up with a round turn.

563
00:55:45,584 --> 00:55:48,178
There's no use. You've run aground.

564
00:55:48,264 --> 00:55:49,583
No.

565
00:55:49,664 --> 00:55:51,734
Beneath us.

566
00:55:52,544 --> 00:55:54,853
Foul breath.

567
00:56:06,904 --> 00:56:09,338
Hey! Hey!

568
00:56:45,264 --> 00:56:48,017
Down on your marrowbones and pray.

569
00:57:02,304 --> 00:57:06,092
Get back! Get back!

570
00:57:36,384 --> 00:57:39,899
Five men still alive. The rest have moved on.

571
00:57:56,344 --> 00:57:59,381
Do you fear death?

572
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:05,374
Do you fear that dark abyss?

573
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:09,903
All your deeds laid bare.

574
00:58:10,744 --> 00:58:13,622
All your sins punished.

575
00:58:15,384 --> 00:58:17,773
I can offer you

576
00:58:17,864 --> 00:58:20,219
an escape.

577
00:58:20,304 --> 00:58:23,262
Don't listen to him!

578
00:58:31,544 --> 00:58:34,422
Do you not fear death?

579
00:58:36,784 --> 00:58:39,252
I'll take my chances, sir.

580
00:58:39,344 --> 00:58:41,653
To the depths.

581
00:58:46,904 --> 00:58:48,860
Cruel blackguard!

582
00:58:48,944 --> 00:58:51,014
Life is cruel.

583
00:58:51,904 --> 00:58:54,577
Why should the afterlife be any different?

584
00:58:55,064 --> 00:58:58,101
I offer you a choice.

585
00:58:58,184 --> 00:59:00,778
Join my crew

586
00:59:00,864 --> 00:59:03,094
and postpone the judgment.

587
00:59:04,464 --> 00:59:07,820
One hundred years before the mast.

588
00:59:10,024 --> 00:59:11,901
Will ye serve?

589
00:59:13,624 --> 00:59:15,535
I-I will serve.

590
00:59:15,624 --> 00:59:17,933
There.

591
00:59:24,544 --> 00:59:27,900
You are neither dead nor dying.

592
00:59:27,984 --> 00:59:30,498
What is your purpose here?

593
00:59:33,184 --> 00:59:36,221
Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt.

594
00:59:37,304 --> 00:59:40,421
What is your purpose here?

595
00:59:40,504 --> 00:59:43,576
Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt.

596
00:59:46,424 --> 00:59:48,892
Did he, now?

597
00:59:48,984 --> 00:59:52,294
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.

598
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,093
Oh.

599
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:11,223
You have a debt to pay.

600
01:00:11,304 --> 01:00:14,580
You've been captain of the Black Pearl for 13 years.

601
01:00:14,664 --> 01:00:16,655
That was our agreement.

602
01:00:16,744 --> 01:00:20,419
Technically I was only captain for two years, then I was mutinied upon.

603
01:00:20,504 --> 01:00:24,133
Then you were a poor captain, but a captain nonetheless.

604
01:00:24,224 --> 01:00:27,341
Have you not introduced yourself all these years

605
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:29,892
as Captain Jack Sparrow?

606
01:00:32,744 --> 01:00:35,577
You have my payment. One soul to serve on your ship.

607
01:00:35,664 --> 01:00:38,781
-One soul is not equal to another. -Aha!

608
01:00:38,864 --> 01:00:45,133
We've established my proposal is sound in principle. Now we're haggling over price.

609
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,692
Price?

610
01:00:49,624 --> 01:00:52,980
Just how many souls do you think my soul is worth?

611
01:00:56,584 --> 01:00:59,144
One hundred souls.

612
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:01,742
Three days.

613
01:01:02,224 --> 01:01:05,933
You're a diamond, mate. Send me back the boy. I'll get started right off.

614
01:01:06,024 --> 01:01:09,016
I keep the boy. A good-faith payment.

615
01:01:09,104 --> 01:01:12,938
That leaves you only 99 more to go.

616
01:01:14,584 --> 01:01:16,495
Have you not met Will Turner?

617
01:01:16,584 --> 01:01:19,303
He's noble, heroic, a terrific soprano.

618
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:21,659
Worth at least four.

619
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:23,894
Maybe three and a half.

620
01:01:24,664 --> 01:01:27,542
And did I happen to mention...

621
01:01:27,624 --> 01:01:29,979
he's in love?

622
01:01:30,784 --> 01:01:33,298
With a girl.

623
01:01:33,384 --> 01:01:35,693
Due to be married.

624
01:01:35,784 --> 01:01:37,661
Betrothed.

625
01:01:38,584 --> 01:01:43,100
Dividing him from her and her from him would only be half as cruel

626
01:01:43,184 --> 01:01:47,018
as actually allowing them to be joined in holy matrimony.

627
01:01:47,104 --> 01:01:49,015
Eh?

628
01:01:51,664 --> 01:01:56,340
I keep the boy. 99 souls.

629
01:01:56,424 --> 01:01:58,984
But I wonder, Sparrow,

630
01:01:59,064 --> 01:02:01,214
can you live with this?

631
01:02:01,904 --> 01:02:05,579
Can you condemn an innocent man, a friend,

632
01:02:05,664 --> 01:02:10,419
to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free?

633
01:02:13,504 --> 01:02:15,460
Yep. I'm good with it.

634
01:02:15,544 --> 01:02:18,581
Shall we seal it in blood? I mean... ink.

635
01:02:22,704 --> 01:02:25,343
Three days.

636
01:02:29,664 --> 01:02:31,734
-Three days. -

637
01:02:39,024 --> 01:02:41,822
-Er, Mr. Gibbs. -Aye.

638
01:02:41,904 --> 01:02:44,418
I-I feel sullied and unusual.

639
01:02:44,504 --> 01:02:50,056
And how do you intend to harvest these 99 souls in three days?

640
01:02:50,144 --> 01:02:54,660
Fortunately, he was mum as to the condition in which these souls need be.

641
01:02:54,744 --> 01:02:55,938
Ah.

642
01:02:56,024 --> 01:02:57,901
Tortuga.

643
01:02:58,944 --> 01:03:00,343
Tortuga.

644
01:03:04,184 --> 01:03:07,654
It's an outrage. Port tariffs, berthing fees,

645
01:03:07,744 --> 01:03:10,861
wharf handling and, heaven help us, pilotage.

646
01:03:10,944 --> 01:03:15,142
Are we all to work for the East India Trading Company, then?

647
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:19,502
I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is the only free port left in these waters.

648
01:03:19,584 --> 01:03:22,098
A pirate port is what you mean. Well, I'm sorry.

649
01:03:22,184 --> 01:03:27,417
An honest sailor is what I am. I make my living fair and I sleep well each night.

650
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:29,935
S-sir!

651
01:03:52,264 --> 01:03:54,698
She wants you to do something.

652
01:03:57,704 --> 01:04:00,264
She's trying to give a sign.

653
01:04:04,144 --> 01:04:05,577
Whoa!

654
01:04:08,304 --> 01:04:10,693
Over there! Look for a sign!

655
01:04:15,264 --> 01:04:17,334
Look, there! There it is!

656
01:04:17,784 --> 01:04:20,252
-There's the sign! -That's seaweed.

657
01:04:20,344 --> 01:04:23,302
-Seaweed can be a sign. -Looks like entrails.

658
01:04:23,384 --> 01:04:28,253
-That would be a bad sign. - What's that over there?

659
01:04:45,824 --> 01:04:48,896
And what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?

660
01:04:48,984 --> 01:04:51,134
I've never sailed a day in me life.

661
01:04:51,224 --> 01:04:54,261
I figure I should get out, see the world while I'm still young.

662
01:04:54,344 --> 01:04:57,575
You'll do. Make your mark. Next!

663
01:04:57,664 --> 01:05:00,224
My wife ran off with my dog

664
01:05:00,664 --> 01:05:03,019
and I'm drunk for a month

665
01:05:03,104 --> 01:05:05,095
and I don't give an ass rat's

666
01:05:05,184 --> 01:05:07,061
if I live or die.

667
01:05:07,144 --> 01:05:10,056
-Perfect. Next! -I know what I want. I know what I want...

668
01:05:10,144 --> 01:05:14,103
-Me have one arm and a bum leg. -It's the crow's nest for you.

669
01:05:14,184 --> 01:05:16,254
-I know what I want. - Next!

670
01:05:16,344 --> 01:05:21,737
Ever since I was a little lad, I've always wanted to sail the seas... forever.

671
01:05:21,824 --> 01:05:24,418
Sooner than you think. Sign the roster.

672
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,699
Thanks very much.

673
01:05:26,784 --> 01:05:31,733
- How we going? -Including those four, that gives us... four.

674
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:37,134
And what's your story?

675
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:39,613
My story.

676
01:05:39,704 --> 01:05:44,573
It's exactly the same as your story, just one chapter behind.

677
01:05:44,664 --> 01:05:48,134
I chased a man across the seven seas.

678
01:05:48,224 --> 01:05:50,943
The pursuit cost me my crew,

679
01:05:51,024 --> 01:05:53,584
my commission,

680
01:05:53,664 --> 01:05:55,734
and my life.

681
01:06:00,584 --> 01:06:05,214
-Commodore? -No, not any more. Weren't you listening?

682
01:06:08,104 --> 01:06:10,572
I nearly had you all off Tripoli.

683
01:06:11,304 --> 01:06:15,661
I would have, if not for the hurricane.

684
01:06:15,744 --> 01:06:17,063
Lord.

685
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:19,055
You didn't try to sail through it?

686
01:06:19,144 --> 01:06:21,578
So, do I make your crew

687
01:06:21,664 --> 01:06:23,575
or not?

688
01:06:24,384 --> 01:06:27,023
You haven't said where you're going.

689
01:06:27,104 --> 01:06:29,095
Somewhere nice?!

690
01:06:30,104 --> 01:06:32,413
So, am I worthy to serve

691
01:06:32,504 --> 01:06:35,177
under Captain Jack Sparrow?

692
01:06:37,544 --> 01:06:40,820
Or should I just kill you now?

693
01:06:46,704 --> 01:06:48,774
You're hired.

694
01:06:48,864 --> 01:06:52,698
Sorry. Old habits and all that.

695
01:06:52,784 --> 01:06:56,174
-Easy, sailor! -That's our captain you're threatening.

696
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:10,735
-Time to go. -Aye!

697
01:07:53,544 --> 01:07:56,502
-Thanks, mate. -Aargh!

698
01:08:00,944 --> 01:08:02,775
Carry on.

699
01:08:09,784 --> 01:08:12,252
Come on, then! Who wants some?

700
01:08:12,344 --> 01:08:15,700
Form an orderly line and I'll have you all, one by one.

701
01:08:15,784 --> 01:08:17,979
Come on, who's first?

702
01:08:20,504 --> 01:08:23,894
I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself.

703
01:08:49,464 --> 01:08:52,058
James Norrington.

704
01:08:52,904 --> 01:08:55,896
What has the world done to you?

705
01:09:22,864 --> 01:09:25,014
Heave!

706
01:09:25,264 --> 01:09:27,380
Heave!

707
01:09:28,024 --> 01:09:29,935
Heave!

708
01:09:30,184 --> 01:09:32,015
Heave!

709
01:09:33,024 --> 01:09:36,334
-Heave! -Heave!

710
01:09:39,104 --> 01:09:42,938
Secure the mast tackle, Mr. Turner!

711
01:09:45,824 --> 01:09:47,894
Set to it!

712
01:09:52,984 --> 01:09:55,782
-Step aside. -Hey! Mind yourself!

713
01:09:56,184 --> 01:09:58,493
Let go, boy!

714
01:10:01,024 --> 01:10:03,094
No.

715
01:10:10,744 --> 01:10:13,304
Haul that weevil to his feet.

716
01:10:18,624 --> 01:10:21,934
Five lashes will remind you to stay on 'em!

717
01:10:22,024 --> 01:10:26,893
-No! -Impeding me in my duties?

718
01:10:26,984 --> 01:10:30,659
-You'll share the punishment. -I'll take it all.

719
01:10:30,744 --> 01:10:33,019
Will you, now?

720
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:38,132
And what would prompt such an act of charity?

721
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:43,581
My son.

722
01:10:48,304 --> 01:10:50,534
He's my son.

723
01:11:01,304 --> 01:11:04,455
What fortuitous circumstance be this?

724
01:11:04,544 --> 01:11:08,253
Five lashes be owed, I believe it is.

725
01:11:12,984 --> 01:11:15,373
No. No, I won't!

726
01:11:15,464 --> 01:11:18,137
The cat's out of the bag, Mr. Turner.

727
01:11:18,544 --> 01:11:23,777
Your issue will feel its sting, be it by the bosun's hand or your own.

728
01:11:27,464 --> 01:11:29,739
No.

729
01:11:29,824 --> 01:11:31,735
-Bosun! -No!

730
01:12:14,144 --> 01:12:17,420
You had it easy, boy!

731
01:12:17,504 --> 01:12:20,337
-Will. -I don't need your help.

732
01:12:22,024 --> 01:12:28,099
The bosun prides himself on cleaving flesh from bone, with every swing.

733
01:12:28,184 --> 01:12:32,939
So I'm to understand what you did was an act of compassion?

734
01:12:33,024 --> 01:12:35,060
Yes.

735
01:12:40,784 --> 01:12:46,416
100 years before the mast, losing who you were, bit by bit,

736
01:12:46,504 --> 01:12:50,213
until you end up... end up like poor Wyvern here.

737
01:12:51,944 --> 01:12:55,823
Once you've sworn an oath to the Dutchman, there's no leaving it.

738
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:58,862
Not until your debt is paid.

739
01:12:58,944 --> 01:13:01,299
I've sworn no oath.

740
01:13:02,944 --> 01:13:05,014
You must get away.

741
01:13:06,024 --> 01:13:08,060
Not until I find this.

742
01:13:09,664 --> 01:13:11,461
The key.

743
01:13:18,384 --> 01:13:20,693
The dead man's chest.

744
01:13:21,824 --> 01:13:23,860
What do you know of this?

745
01:13:23,944 --> 01:13:28,460
Open the chest with the key, and stab the heart...

746
01:13:28,544 --> 01:13:31,536
No, don't stab the heart.

747
01:13:31,624 --> 01:13:36,459
The Dutchman needs a living heart or there'll be no captain,

748
01:13:36,544 --> 01:13:40,662
and if there's no captain, there's no one to have the key.

749
01:13:41,064 --> 01:13:43,532
So the captain has the key?

750
01:13:44,704 --> 01:13:47,377
-Where is the key? -Hidden.

751
01:13:47,744 --> 01:13:50,417
-Where is the chest? -Hidden.

752
01:13:53,464 --> 01:13:55,216
Captain Sparrow!

753
01:13:55,304 --> 01:13:57,659
Come to join me crew, lad? Welcome aboard.

754
01:13:57,744 --> 01:14:00,304
I'm here to find the man I love.

755
01:14:01,264 --> 01:14:05,621
I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.

756
01:14:06,704 --> 01:14:10,663
Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.

757
01:14:10,744 --> 01:14:12,063
Elizabeth.

758
01:14:12,144 --> 01:14:14,453
Hide the rum.

759
01:14:14,544 --> 01:14:17,297
These clothes do not flatter you. It should be a dress or nothing.

760
01:14:17,384 --> 01:14:20,342
-I happen to have no dress in my cabin. -Jack.

761
01:14:22,464 --> 01:14:25,581
I know Will came to find you. Where is he?

762
01:14:25,664 --> 01:14:29,054
Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this, but...

763
01:14:29,144 --> 01:14:35,777
through unfortunate circumstances that had nothing whatsoever to do with me,

764
01:14:35,864 --> 01:14:40,380
poor Will has been press-ganged into Davy Jones's crew.

765
01:14:41,384 --> 01:14:43,215
Davy Jones?

766
01:14:44,624 --> 01:14:46,899
Oh, please.

767
01:14:47,944 --> 01:14:50,299
The captain of the Flying Dutchman?

768
01:14:50,384 --> 01:14:53,615
-You look awful. What are you doing here? -You hired me.

769
01:14:53,704 --> 01:14:55,854
I can't help it if your standards are lax.

770
01:14:55,944 --> 01:14:58,697
-You smell funny. -Jack!

771
01:14:59,104 --> 01:15:01,777
All I want is to find Will.

772
01:15:05,024 --> 01:15:09,302
Are you certain? Is that what you really want most?

773
01:15:10,184 --> 01:15:12,459
Of course.

774
01:15:12,544 --> 01:15:16,617
Because I would think you'd want to find a way to save Will most.

775
01:15:17,224 --> 01:15:20,933
-And you'd have a way of doing that? -Well...

776
01:15:21,024 --> 01:15:24,141
-there is a chest. -Oh, dear.

777
01:15:24,224 --> 01:15:26,454
A chest of unknown size and origin.

778
01:15:26,544 --> 01:15:31,254
What contains the still-beating heart of Davy Jones.

779
01:15:32,624 --> 01:15:34,376
And whoever possesses that chest

780
01:15:34,464 --> 01:15:38,252
possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants,

781
01:15:38,344 --> 01:15:43,054
including saving brave William from his grim fate.

782
01:15:43,144 --> 01:15:46,580
You don't actually believe him, do you?

783
01:15:51,144 --> 01:15:53,374
How would we find it?

784
01:15:55,464 --> 01:15:57,216
With this.

785
01:15:57,304 --> 01:16:00,102
My compass... is unique.

786
01:16:00,624 --> 01:16:03,696
"Unique" here having the meaning of "broken".

787
01:16:04,664 --> 01:16:08,896
True enough, this compass does not point north.

788
01:16:11,064 --> 01:16:13,737
Where does it point?

789
01:16:13,824 --> 01:16:18,420
It points to the thing you want most in this world.

790
01:16:20,984 --> 01:16:22,895
Oh, Jack.

791
01:16:24,824 --> 01:16:28,419
-Are you telling the truth? -Every word, love.

792
01:16:28,504 --> 01:16:30,859
And what you want most in this world

793
01:16:31,704 --> 01:16:36,414
is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?

794
01:16:36,504 --> 01:16:41,259
-To save Will. -By finding the chest of Davy Jones.

795
01:16:55,713 --> 01:16:57,943
-Mr. Gibbs! -Cap'n.

796
01:16:58,033 --> 01:17:00,183
-We have our heading. -Finally!

797
01:17:00,273 --> 01:17:04,664
Cast off those lines. Weigh anchor and crowd that canvas!

798
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:07,904
-Miss Swann. -

799
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:12,109
Welcome to the crew, former commodore.

800
01:17:18,473 --> 01:17:23,149
There's something to knowing the exact shape of the world and one's place in it.

801
01:17:23,233 --> 01:17:25,827
I assure you, these are not necessary.

802
01:17:25,913 --> 01:17:30,191
I thought you'd be interested in the whereabouts of your daughter.

803
01:17:30,273 --> 01:17:33,629
-You have news of her? -Most recently seen on Tortuga,

804
01:17:33,713 --> 01:17:37,501
and then left in the company of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow,

805
01:17:37,593 --> 01:17:40,391
and other fugitives from justice.

806
01:17:40,473 --> 01:17:42,225
"Justice"? Hardly.

807
01:17:42,313 --> 01:17:47,865
Including the previous owner of this sword, I believe.

808
01:17:48,353 --> 01:17:52,904
Our ships are in pursuit. Justice will be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass,

809
01:17:52,993 --> 01:17:56,781
and all manner of remorseless pieces of metal.

810
01:17:56,873 --> 01:18:02,630
I find it distasteful to even contemplate the horror facing all those on board.

811
01:18:05,793 --> 01:18:07,545
What do you want from me?

812
01:18:07,633 --> 01:18:10,670
Your authority as governor, your influence in London,

813
01:18:10,753 --> 01:18:14,189
and your loyalty to the East India Trading Company.

814
01:18:15,193 --> 01:18:17,627
To you, you mean.

815
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:23,752
Shall I remove these shackles?

816
01:18:26,833 --> 01:18:30,109
Do what you can for my daughter.

817
01:18:36,113 --> 01:18:40,868
So you see, Mercer, every man has a price he will willingly accept.

818
01:18:40,953 --> 01:18:44,662
Even for what he hoped never to sell.

819
01:18:50,113 --> 01:18:53,105
I wager... ten years.

820
01:18:53,953 --> 01:18:56,183
I'll match ten years.

821
01:18:57,153 --> 01:18:58,791
Agreed.

822
01:19:01,673 --> 01:19:04,312
Wondering how it's played?

823
01:19:04,393 --> 01:19:06,190
-I understand. -Liar!

824
01:19:06,273 --> 01:19:11,631
It's a game of deception. But your bet includes all the dice, not just your own.

825
01:19:11,993 --> 01:19:14,905
-What are they wagering? -Oh, the only thing we have.

826
01:19:14,993 --> 01:19:17,268
Years of service.

827
01:19:19,313 --> 01:19:23,352
-So any crew member can be challenged? -Aye. Anyone.

828
01:19:26,113 --> 01:19:28,752
I challenge Davy Jones.

829
01:19:47,593 --> 01:19:50,426
I accept, mate.

830
01:20:01,513 --> 01:20:06,826
-The stakes? -My soul. An eternity of servitude.

831
01:20:06,913 --> 01:20:09,029
No!

832
01:20:11,113 --> 01:20:12,592
Against?

833
01:20:13,993 --> 01:20:15,904
I want this.

834
01:20:27,553 --> 01:20:32,263
-How do you know of the key? -That's not part of the game, is it?

835
01:20:35,313 --> 01:20:37,827
You can still walk away.

836
01:21:01,513 --> 01:21:04,471
-What's this? -I'm in. Matching his wager.

837
01:21:04,553 --> 01:21:07,351
No! Don't do this.

838
01:21:09,193 --> 01:21:11,866
The die is cast.

839
01:21:11,953 --> 01:21:14,911
I bid three twos.

840
01:21:14,993 --> 01:21:17,063
It's your bid, Captain.

841
01:21:23,113 --> 01:21:25,991
Four fours.

842
01:21:34,713 --> 01:21:37,705
Four fives.

843
01:21:37,793 --> 01:21:39,431
Six threes.

844
01:21:48,713 --> 01:21:51,750
Seven fives.

845
01:22:14,673 --> 01:22:16,868
Eight fives.

846
01:22:21,393 --> 01:22:24,749
Welcome to the crew, lad.

847
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:29,711
Twelve fives.

848
01:22:29,953 --> 01:22:31,545
Twelve fives.

849
01:22:31,633 --> 01:22:34,352
Call me a liar, or up the bid.

850
01:22:35,633 --> 01:22:39,069
And be called a liar myself for my trouble?

851
01:22:42,393 --> 01:22:47,069
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar and you will spend an eternity on this ship.

852
01:22:48,913 --> 01:22:52,952
Master Turner, feel free to go ashore...

853
01:22:54,193 --> 01:22:57,185
the very next time we make port!

854
01:23:04,473 --> 01:23:07,863
Fool. Why did you do that?

855
01:23:09,353 --> 01:23:11,469
I couldn't let you lose.

856
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:14,192
It was never about winning or losing.

857
01:23:16,473 --> 01:23:17,872
The key.

858
01:23:19,473 --> 01:23:22,226
You just wanted to know where it was.

859
01:23:41,033 --> 01:23:43,547
Captain says I'm to relieve you.

860
01:23:47,393 --> 01:23:49,384
Captain's orders.

861
01:25:34,713 --> 01:25:37,181
Here. Take this, too.

862
01:25:38,113 --> 01:25:41,344
Now, get yourself to land, and stay there.

863
01:25:41,793 --> 01:25:44,910
It was always in my blood to die at sea.

864
01:25:44,993 --> 01:25:47,905
It was not a fate I ever wanted for you.

865
01:25:52,473 --> 01:25:56,022
It's not a fate you had to choose for yourself, either.

866
01:25:56,113 --> 01:26:02,063
Aye. I could say I did what I had to, when I left you to go pirating.

867
01:26:02,953 --> 01:26:07,105
But it would taste a lie to say it wasn't what I wanted.

868
01:26:08,753 --> 01:26:11,313
You owe me nothing, Will.

869
01:26:11,393 --> 01:26:13,509
Now go.

870
01:26:14,593 --> 01:26:17,153
-They'll know you helped me. -

871
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:20,384
What more can they do to me?

872
01:26:25,993 --> 01:26:28,143
I take this with a promise.

873
01:26:28,233 --> 01:26:30,542
I'll find a way to sever Jones's hold on you,

874
01:26:30,633 --> 01:26:34,342
and not rest until this blade pierces his heart.

875
01:26:35,793 --> 01:26:38,023
I will not abandon you.

876
01:26:40,553 --> 01:26:43,021
I promise.

877
01:26:56,593 --> 01:26:58,629
- Beckett? - Yes, they're signed.

878
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:01,147
Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company.

879
01:27:01,233 --> 01:27:02,586
Bleurgh!

880
01:27:02,673 --> 01:27:06,268
Will was working for Beckett and never said a word.

881
01:27:06,633 --> 01:27:10,262
Beckett wants the compass. Only one reason for that.

882
01:27:10,353 --> 01:27:12,787
Of course.

883
01:27:12,873 --> 01:27:16,468
-He wants the chest. -Yes, he did say something about a chest.

884
01:27:16,553 --> 01:27:20,023
If the company controls the chest, they controls the sea.

885
01:27:20,113 --> 01:27:23,708
-A truly discomfiting notion, love. -And bad.

886
01:27:23,793 --> 01:27:27,308
Bad for every mother's son what calls himself a pirate.

887
01:27:27,393 --> 01:27:30,510
I think there's a bit more speed to be coaxed from these sails.

888
01:27:30,593 --> 01:27:32,629
Brace the foreyard!

889
01:27:32,713 --> 01:27:35,785
Might I enquire as to how you came by these?

890
01:27:35,873 --> 01:27:37,704
-Persuasion. -Friendly?

891
01:27:37,793 --> 01:27:39,351
Decidedly not.

892
01:27:39,433 --> 01:27:44,791
Will strikes a deal, yet you were the one with the prize -full pardon.

893
01:27:44,873 --> 01:27:47,103
"Commission as a privateer on behalf of England

894
01:27:47,193 --> 01:27:49,787
and the East India Trading Company."

895
01:27:49,873 --> 01:27:52,068
As if I could be bought for such a low price.

896
01:27:52,153 --> 01:27:54,542
-Jack, the letters, give them back. -No.

897
01:27:54,633 --> 01:27:56,863
Persuade me.

898
01:27:56,953 --> 01:28:00,582
You do know Will taught me how to handle a sword?

899
01:28:02,873 --> 01:28:06,422
As I said, persuade me.

900
01:28:20,113 --> 01:28:22,468
It's a curious thing.

901
01:28:23,513 --> 01:28:28,951
There was a time I would have wanted you to look like that while thinking about me.

902
01:28:29,033 --> 01:28:31,103
-I don't know what you mean. -I think you do.

903
01:28:31,193 --> 01:28:34,105
Oh, don't be absurd. I trust him, that's all.

904
01:28:38,593 --> 01:28:40,788
So you never wondered how your latest fiancé

905
01:28:40,873 --> 01:28:44,752
ended up on the Flying Dutchman in the first place?

906
01:29:08,233 --> 01:29:11,384
Strange to come upon a longboat so far out in open water.

907
01:29:11,473 --> 01:29:14,749
Just put as many leagues behind us as you can. As fast as you can.

908
01:29:14,833 --> 01:29:17,825
And what are we running from?

909
01:29:22,433 --> 01:29:25,106
That dress. Where did you get it?

910
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:26,831
It was found aboard the ship.

911
01:29:26,913 --> 01:29:31,225
The crew thought it was a spirit bringing some omen of ill-fate.

912
01:29:31,313 --> 01:29:34,589
-That's foolish. -Oh, yes. Exceedingly foolish.

913
01:29:34,673 --> 01:29:40,430
It brought good fortune. The spirit told us, "Pull in at Tortuga",

914
01:29:40,513 --> 01:29:42,424
and we made a nice bit of profit there.

915
01:29:42,513 --> 01:29:45,505
Off the books, of course.

916
01:29:45,593 --> 01:29:49,222
I imagine some of your crew may have jumped ship there.

917
01:29:49,313 --> 01:29:52,066
-Why do you ask? -Captain! A ship's been spotted.

918
01:29:52,153 --> 01:29:54,872
-Colors? -She isn't flying any.

919
01:29:54,953 --> 01:29:56,864
-Pirates. -Or worse.

920
01:30:07,873 --> 01:30:11,309
You will watch this.

921
01:30:14,353 --> 01:30:16,071
Aagh!

922
01:30:18,153 --> 01:30:21,031
Let no joyful voice be heard!

923
01:30:23,073 --> 01:30:26,110
Let no man look up at the sky with hope.

924
01:30:26,193 --> 01:30:27,865
Aargh!

925
01:30:28,313 --> 01:30:33,831
And let this day be cursed by we who ready to wake...

926
01:30:35,233 --> 01:30:37,303
the kraken.

927
01:30:37,713 --> 01:30:39,305
No!

928
01:30:55,513 --> 01:30:57,947
I've doomed us all.

929
01:30:58,393 --> 01:31:01,112
It's the Flying Dutchman!

930
01:31:05,833 --> 01:31:08,142
Oh, Mother Carey's chickens! What happened?

931
01:31:08,233 --> 01:31:10,667
Must have hit a reef.

932
01:31:17,993 --> 01:31:20,905
Free the rudder! Hard to port then hard to starboard.

933
01:31:20,993 --> 01:31:24,349
-Free the rudder! -Hard to port!

934
01:31:31,313 --> 01:31:34,669
-Kraken! -Kraken!

935
01:31:47,593 --> 01:31:50,426
Here it is! Take it!

936
01:31:50,513 --> 01:31:52,424
Take it!

937
01:31:53,513 --> 01:31:54,548
Aargh!

938
01:31:59,153 --> 01:32:01,109
Agh! Aaaagh!

939
01:32:58,113 --> 01:32:59,751
Aagh!

940
01:33:05,193 --> 01:33:07,104
Aaagh!

941
01:33:58,953 --> 01:34:03,310
The boy's not here. He must have been claimed by the sea.

942
01:34:03,393 --> 01:34:05,782
I am the sea.

943
01:34:09,313 --> 01:34:12,430
You need time alone with your thoughts.

944
01:34:12,513 --> 01:34:14,947
-Brig! -What of the survivors?

945
01:34:20,233 --> 01:34:23,464
There are no survivors.

946
01:34:42,833 --> 01:34:46,542
The chest is no longer safe. Chart a course to Isla Cruces.

947
01:34:46,633 --> 01:34:49,227
Get me there first, or there'll be the devil to pay.

948
01:34:49,313 --> 01:34:51,065
"First"?

949
01:34:51,153 --> 01:34:54,225
Who sent that thieving charlatan onto my ship?

950
01:34:54,313 --> 01:34:56,190
Who told him of the key?

951
01:34:59,193 --> 01:35:01,263
Jack Sparrow.

952
01:35:18,873 --> 01:35:25,392
My intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.

953
01:35:25,473 --> 01:35:28,749
I just thought I'd be married by now.

954
01:35:28,833 --> 01:35:31,063
I'm so ready to be married.

955
01:35:38,313 --> 01:35:40,269
You know...

956
01:35:41,833 --> 01:35:47,032
Lizzie, I am captain of a ship,

957
01:35:47,113 --> 01:35:55,270
and being captain of a ship, I could in fact perform a "marr-i-age" right here.

958
01:35:55,353 --> 01:35:57,628
Right on this deck.

959
01:35:57,713 --> 01:35:59,590
Right... now.

960
01:36:03,073 --> 01:36:05,268
No, thank you.

961
01:36:05,353 --> 01:36:06,832
Why not?

962
01:36:06,913 --> 01:36:09,825
We are very much alike, you and I. I and you. Us.

963
01:36:09,913 --> 01:36:14,782
Oh. Except for a sense of honor and decency and a moral center.

964
01:36:15,233 --> 01:36:17,542
And personal hygiene.

965
01:36:18,953 --> 01:36:21,148
Trifles.

966
01:36:21,233 --> 01:36:23,667
You will come over to my side. I know it.

967
01:36:23,753 --> 01:36:28,827
-You seem very certain. -One word, love. Curiosity.

968
01:36:28,913 --> 01:36:30,471
You long for freedom.

969
01:36:30,553 --> 01:36:33,511
You long to do what you want to do because you want it.

970
01:36:33,593 --> 01:36:36,551
To act on selfish impulse.

971
01:36:36,633 --> 01:36:39,272
You want to see what it's like.

972
01:36:39,353 --> 01:36:43,631
One day, you won't be able to resist.

973
01:36:44,153 --> 01:36:46,621
Why doesn't your compass work?

974
01:36:48,193 --> 01:36:51,151
My compass works fine.

975
01:36:51,553 --> 01:36:53,271
Because you and I are alike,

976
01:36:53,353 --> 01:36:56,470
and there will come a moment when you have a chance to show it.

977
01:36:56,553 --> 01:36:59,704
-To do the right thing. -I love those moments.

978
01:37:00,193 --> 01:37:02,388
I like to wave at them as they pass by.

979
01:37:02,473 --> 01:37:07,831
You'll have the chance to do something... something courageous.

980
01:37:07,913 --> 01:37:10,950
And when you do, you'll discover something.

981
01:37:11,033 --> 01:37:13,501
That you're a good man.

982
01:37:13,593 --> 01:37:15,982
All evidence to the contrary.

983
01:37:16,073 --> 01:37:18,985
Oh, I have faith in you.

984
01:37:19,073 --> 01:37:21,871
-Want to know why? -Do tell, dearie.

985
01:37:23,593 --> 01:37:26,471
Curiosity.

986
01:37:26,553 --> 01:37:29,386
You're going to want it.

987
01:37:29,473 --> 01:37:33,182
A chance to be admired and gain the rewards that follow.

988
01:37:34,473 --> 01:37:36,543
You won't be able to resist.

989
01:37:37,873 --> 01:37:42,867
You're going to want to know what it tastes like.

990
01:37:45,313 --> 01:37:48,191
I do want to know what it tastes like.

991
01:37:48,273 --> 01:37:49,991
But... seeing as you're a good man,

992
01:37:50,073 --> 01:37:54,305
I know that you'd never put me in a position that would compromise my honor.

993
01:38:02,273 --> 01:38:04,309
I'm proud of you, Jack.

994
01:38:04,393 --> 01:38:07,112
Land, ho!

995
01:38:12,073 --> 01:38:13,825
I want my jar of dirt.

996
01:38:15,233 --> 01:38:18,031
-You're pulling too fast. -You're pulling too slow.

997
01:38:18,113 --> 01:38:23,028
-We don't want the kraken to catch us. -I'm saving me strength for when it comes.

998
01:38:23,113 --> 01:38:27,345
And I don't think it's "kracken" anyways. I always heard it said "krayken".

999
01:38:27,433 --> 01:38:28,991
-With a long a? -Uh-huh.

1000
01:38:29,073 --> 01:38:32,782
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. "Krocken" is how it's pronounced in Scandinavian,

1001
01:38:32,873 --> 01:38:34,545
and "kracken" is closer to that.

1002
01:38:34,633 --> 01:38:37,943
We ain't Scandinavians, are we? "Krayken."

1003
01:38:38,033 --> 01:38:40,627
It's a mythological creature. I can calls it what I wants.

1004
01:38:44,353 --> 01:38:46,503
Guard the boat. Mind the tide.

1005
01:38:46,593 --> 01:38:48,823
Don't touch my dirt.

1006
01:39:23,233 --> 01:39:28,227
This doesn't work. And it certainly doesn't show you what you want most.

1007
01:39:32,233 --> 01:39:35,430
Yes, it does. You're sitting on it.

1008
01:39:36,273 --> 01:39:37,911
-Beg pardon? -Move.

1009
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:47,986
-"Guard the boat!" "Mind the tide!" -I could join the circus.

1010
01:39:48,073 --> 01:39:49,631
Mind if I shine your shoes, sir?

1011
01:39:53,873 --> 01:39:58,389
They're here. And I cannot step foot on land again for near of a decade.

1012
01:39:58,473 --> 01:40:00,384
You'll trust us to act in your stead?

1013
01:40:00,473 --> 01:40:03,704
I'll trust you to know what awaits you should you fail!

1014
01:40:05,233 --> 01:40:08,111
-Down, then! -Down!

1015
01:41:14,953 --> 01:41:16,944
It's real.

1016
01:41:17,873 --> 01:41:19,864
You actually were telling the truth.

1017
01:41:19,953 --> 01:41:23,343
I do that quite a lot, yet people are always surprised.

1018
01:41:23,433 --> 01:41:26,186
With good reason!

1019
01:41:26,273 --> 01:41:28,628
Will!

1020
01:41:28,713 --> 01:41:32,342
You're all right! Thank God! I came to find you!

1021
01:41:38,153 --> 01:41:40,189
How did you get here?

1022
01:41:40,273 --> 01:41:44,061
Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them, strapped to my feet.

1023
01:41:44,153 --> 01:41:45,950
Not so easy, is it?

1024
01:41:46,033 --> 01:41:48,547
-But I do owe you thanks, Jack. -You do?

1025
01:41:48,633 --> 01:41:52,626
After you tricked me onto that ship to square your debt with Jones...

1026
01:41:52,713 --> 01:41:54,669
-What? - What?

1027
01:41:55,233 --> 01:41:57,793
...I was reunited with my father.

1028
01:41:57,873 --> 01:42:00,467
Oh, well... you're welcome, then.

1029
01:42:00,953 --> 01:42:04,628
Everything you said to me, every word was a lie!

1030
01:42:04,713 --> 01:42:06,146
Pretty much.

1031
01:42:06,233 --> 01:42:08,508
Time and tide, love.

1032
01:42:08,593 --> 01:42:10,743
Oi! What are you doing?

1033
01:42:11,793 --> 01:42:14,068
I'm going to kill Jones.

1034
01:42:15,033 --> 01:42:17,228
Can't let you do that, William.

1035
01:42:17,313 --> 01:42:23,104
Cos if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh?

1036
01:42:28,913 --> 01:42:32,110
Now, if you please.

1037
01:42:32,753 --> 01:42:35,187
The key.

1038
01:42:37,273 --> 01:42:39,867
I keep the promises I make, Jack.

1039
01:42:39,953 --> 01:42:43,150
I intend to free my father. I hope you're here to see it.

1040
01:42:43,233 --> 01:42:46,703
I can't let you do that either. So sorry.

1041
01:42:46,793 --> 01:42:50,263
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.

1042
01:42:51,073 --> 01:42:54,861
Lord Beckett desires the content of that chest.

1043
01:42:54,953 --> 01:42:57,945
I deliver it, I get my life back.

1044
01:42:58,353 --> 01:43:00,947
Ah. The dark side of ambition.

1045
01:43:01,353 --> 01:43:04,629
Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption.

1046
01:43:04,713 --> 01:43:05,668
Aagh!

1047
01:43:08,753 --> 01:43:10,232
Stop it!

1048
01:43:10,313 --> 01:43:12,144
Hyah!

1049
01:43:16,673 --> 01:43:18,106
Will!

1050
01:43:19,073 --> 01:43:22,065
-Guard the chest! -No!

1051
01:43:22,153 --> 01:43:26,829
This is barbaric! This is no way for grown men to...

1052
01:43:26,913 --> 01:43:32,226
Oh, fine! Let's just haul out our swords and start banging away at each other.

1053
01:43:32,313 --> 01:43:34,827
That will solve everything! I've had it!

1054
01:43:34,913 --> 01:43:39,668
I've had it with wobbly-legged, rum-soaked pirates!

1055
01:43:42,193 --> 01:43:47,142
-How'd this go all screwy? -Well, each wants the chest for hisself.

1056
01:43:47,233 --> 01:43:50,270
Mr. Norrington, I think, is trying to regain a bit of honor,

1057
01:43:50,353 --> 01:43:52,742
old Jack's looking to trade it, save his own skin,

1058
01:43:52,833 --> 01:43:56,826
then Turner, there, I think he's trying to settle some unresolved business

1059
01:43:56,913 --> 01:44:00,383
'twixt him and his twice-cursed pirate father.

1060
01:44:00,473 --> 01:44:02,350
-Sad. - This is madness!

1061
01:44:02,433 --> 01:44:06,062
That chest must be worth more than a shiny penny.

1062
01:44:06,153 --> 01:44:07,984
Terrible temptation.

1063
01:44:08,073 --> 01:44:13,830
If we was any kind of decent, we'd remove temptation from their path.

1064
01:44:19,273 --> 01:44:21,025
Enough!

1065
01:44:24,353 --> 01:44:27,026
Oh. Oh!

1066
01:44:27,113 --> 01:44:29,581
The heat!

1067
01:44:47,873 --> 01:44:49,864
Bugger!

1068
01:45:01,513 --> 01:45:03,902
By your leave, Mr. Turner.

1069
01:45:48,913 --> 01:45:51,871
By your leave, Mr. Norrington.

1070
01:46:41,833 --> 01:46:44,711
Do excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life.

1071
01:46:44,793 --> 01:46:48,672
-Be my guest. -Let us examine that claim for a moment.

1072
01:46:49,073 --> 01:46:54,306
Who was it, that at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars,

1073
01:46:54,393 --> 01:47:00,423
saw fit to free said pirate and take your dearly beloved all to hisself?

1074
01:47:00,513 --> 01:47:01,912
Eh?

1075
01:47:01,993 --> 01:47:04,461
So whose fault is it, really,

1076
01:47:04,553 --> 01:47:08,751
that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?

1077
01:47:08,833 --> 01:47:10,744
Enough!

1078
01:47:12,913 --> 01:47:16,542
Unfortunately, Mr. Turner, he's right!

1079
01:47:18,433 --> 01:47:20,264
Still rooting for you, mate.

1080
01:47:26,593 --> 01:47:28,663
Oh! Oof!

1081
01:47:55,753 --> 01:47:57,903
Aargh!

1082
01:48:16,033 --> 01:48:18,752
We got it! We got it! We got it!

1083
01:48:32,513 --> 01:48:35,471
Hello, poppet.

1084
01:49:01,193 --> 01:49:03,024
Come on, run!

1085
01:49:44,113 --> 01:49:45,990
- Sword! -Sword! Sword!

1086
01:49:48,833 --> 01:49:51,267
Sword!

1087
01:50:07,393 --> 01:50:08,826
Aargh!

1088
01:50:22,673 --> 01:50:24,265
Ugh!

1089
01:50:30,313 --> 01:50:32,827
Follow my voice. Follow my voice.

1090
01:50:32,913 --> 01:50:35,063
To the left... no, turn around.

1091
01:50:35,153 --> 01:50:37,144
Go to the right.

1092
01:50:37,233 --> 01:50:39,747
No, that's a tree.

1093
01:50:39,833 --> 01:50:42,142
Oh, shut it.

1094
01:51:28,673 --> 01:51:30,948
Jar of dirt!

1095
01:51:38,313 --> 01:51:39,382
Argh!

1096
01:52:28,593 --> 01:52:30,504
Right.

1097
01:53:02,313 --> 01:53:04,508
We've got it!

1098
01:53:13,793 --> 01:53:16,705
Come on, Turner!

1099
01:53:32,193 --> 01:53:36,550
Leave him lie! Unless you plan on using him to hit something with.

1100
01:53:36,953 --> 01:53:39,513
-We're not getting out of this. -Not with the chest.

1101
01:53:39,593 --> 01:53:41,470
Into the boat.

1102
01:53:41,553 --> 01:53:44,386
-You're mad! -Don't wait for me.

1103
01:53:50,313 --> 01:53:53,908
-I say we respect his final wish. -Aye!

1104
01:54:02,913 --> 01:54:05,302
Your bravery is wasted.

1105
01:54:06,633 --> 01:54:12,708
I shall pry the chest away from your cold, dead hands.

1106
01:54:14,513 --> 01:54:16,231
-Here you go! -Oof!

1107
01:54:27,513 --> 01:54:29,265
Pirates!

1108
01:54:36,913 --> 01:54:38,426
Hey!

1109
01:54:46,593 --> 01:54:49,949
-What happened to the chest? -Norrington took it to draw them off.

1110
01:54:50,353 --> 01:54:53,470
-You're pulling too hard! -You ain't pulling hard enough!

1111
01:54:53,873 --> 01:54:56,785
-Where's the commodore? -Fell behind.

1112
01:54:56,873 --> 01:54:58,943
My prayers be with him.

1113
01:54:59,033 --> 01:55:00,944
Best not wallow in our grief.

1114
01:55:01,033 --> 01:55:05,709
The bright side is you're back, and made it off free and clear.

1115
01:55:20,433 --> 01:55:22,663
Lord on high, deliver us.

1116
01:55:25,793 --> 01:55:27,545
I'll handle this, mate.

1117
01:55:29,713 --> 01:55:31,305
Oi, fishface!

1118
01:55:32,713 --> 01:55:35,181
Lose something? Eh? Scungilli!

1119
01:55:40,233 --> 01:55:42,144
Got it!

1120
01:55:43,313 --> 01:55:46,225
Come to negotiate, eh, have you, you slimy git?

1121
01:55:46,313 --> 01:55:47,712
Look what I got.

1122
01:55:47,793 --> 01:55:50,751
# I got a jar of dirt, I got a jar of dirt

1123
01:55:50,833 --> 01:55:52,664
# And guess what's inside it?

1124
01:55:53,553 --> 01:55:54,986
Enough!

1125
01:56:02,753 --> 01:56:05,392
-Hard to starboard. -Hard to starboard!

1126
01:56:05,473 --> 01:56:08,510
Brace up the foreyard!

1127
01:56:11,513 --> 01:56:13,469
Hard to starboard!

1128
01:56:13,553 --> 01:56:18,263
Send his beloved Pearl back to the depths.

1129
01:56:29,833 --> 01:56:33,542
She's on us! She's on us!

1130
01:56:35,073 --> 01:56:38,986
-Let them taste the triple guns. -Aye, Captain.

1131
01:56:50,233 --> 01:56:52,189
Aaargh!

1132
01:57:03,793 --> 01:57:05,272
Make fast!

1133
01:57:06,473 --> 01:57:08,907
Go on, me darling! Show us what you've got!

1134
01:57:08,993 --> 01:57:11,632
Come on, girl!

1135
01:57:17,433 --> 01:57:19,742
-She's falling behind! -Aye. We've got her!

1136
01:57:19,833 --> 01:57:23,382
-We're the faster? -Against the wind, the Dutchman beats us.

1137
01:57:23,473 --> 01:57:25,828
-But with the wind... -We rob her advantage.

1138
01:57:25,913 --> 01:57:27,665
Aye.

1139
01:57:29,633 --> 01:57:31,112
We're out of range!

1140
01:57:31,193 --> 01:57:35,630
Break off pursuit, run her light and douse canvas!

1141
01:57:35,713 --> 01:57:37,988
We're giving up, sir?

1142
01:57:42,193 --> 01:57:44,104
Agh!

1143
01:57:47,673 --> 01:57:49,868
They're giving up!

1144
01:57:55,713 --> 01:57:57,749
My father is on that ship.

1145
01:57:57,833 --> 01:58:00,222
We can take her. We should turn and fight.

1146
01:58:00,313 --> 01:58:06,991
Why fight when you can negotiate? All one needs is the proper leverage.

1147
01:58:07,593 --> 01:58:08,582
Oh!

1148
01:58:16,673 --> 01:58:19,346
Where is it? Where is the thump-thump?

1149
01:58:20,673 --> 01:58:23,506
We must have hit a reef!

1150
01:58:25,513 --> 01:58:29,392
No. It's not a reef! Get away from the rail!

1151
01:58:29,473 --> 01:58:32,385
-What is it? -The kraken.

1152
01:58:32,753 --> 01:58:34,903
-To arms! -Load guns! Defend the mast!

1153
01:58:34,993 --> 01:58:39,271
It'll attack the starboard. Run out the cannons and hold for my signal!

1154
01:59:11,473 --> 01:59:13,828
Easy, boys!

1155
01:59:17,073 --> 01:59:18,062
Will?

1156
01:59:18,553 --> 01:59:20,669
Steady! Steady.

1157
01:59:22,553 --> 01:59:25,863
-Will! -Hold. Hold.

1158
01:59:25,953 --> 01:59:28,831
I think we've held fire long enough.

1159
01:59:29,993 --> 01:59:32,268
-Will! -Fire!

1160
01:59:36,113 --> 01:59:37,466
Oh!

1161
01:59:51,553 --> 01:59:54,943
-It'll be back. We have to get off the ship. -There's no boats.

1162
02:00:02,833 --> 02:00:07,224
Pull the grates. Get all the gunpowder onto the net in the cargo hold!

1163
02:00:09,473 --> 02:00:13,751
-Whatever you do, don't miss. -As soon as you're clear.

1164
02:00:27,353 --> 02:00:31,312
We are short-stocked on gunpowder! Six barrels!

1165
02:00:32,273 --> 02:00:34,309
Hurry up!

1166
02:00:34,393 --> 02:00:37,829
-There's only six kegs of powder! -Then load the rum.

1167
02:00:46,353 --> 02:00:49,072
Aye, the rum too!

1168
02:01:16,113 --> 02:01:18,024
Step to!

1169
02:01:21,553 --> 02:01:24,021
Oh, you coward.

1170
02:01:28,673 --> 02:01:30,629
Not good.

1171
02:01:38,193 --> 02:01:40,787
-Haul away! -Heave!

1172
02:01:40,873 --> 02:01:45,025
-Heave like you're being paid for it! -Put your backs into it!

1173
02:02:00,793 --> 02:02:02,749
Aargh!

1174
02:02:26,353 --> 02:02:29,470
-I got you! I got you! -Don't let me go!

1175
02:02:29,553 --> 02:02:32,113
-I won't let you go! -Shoot me!

1176
02:02:37,193 --> 02:02:40,105
-Clear? -Higher! Higher!

1177
02:02:56,273 --> 02:02:58,309
Here! Come on!

1178
02:02:58,953 --> 02:03:01,467
Come and get me. I'm over here!

1179
02:03:01,553 --> 02:03:03,544
Come on!

1180
02:03:27,473 --> 02:03:30,590
Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!

1181
02:04:54,313 --> 02:04:56,144
Did we kill it?

1182
02:04:56,233 --> 02:04:59,703
No. We just made it angry.

1183
02:05:00,073 --> 02:05:02,906
We're not out of this yet. Captain, orders!

1184
02:05:04,753 --> 02:05:07,347
Abandon ship. Into the longboat.

1185
02:05:09,513 --> 02:05:12,266
Jack. The Pearl.

1186
02:05:13,473 --> 02:05:15,748
She's only a ship, mate.

1187
02:05:15,833 --> 02:05:18,267
He's right. We have to head for land.

1188
02:05:18,353 --> 02:05:21,311
-It's a lot of open water. -It's a lot of water.

1189
02:05:21,393 --> 02:05:25,830
We have to try. We can get away as it takes down the Pearl.

1190
02:05:27,673 --> 02:05:29,425
Abandon ship.

1191
02:05:29,513 --> 02:05:31,822
Abandon ship or abandon hope.

1192
02:05:47,873 --> 02:05:49,943
Thank you, Jack.

1193
02:05:51,953 --> 02:05:54,592
We're not free yet, love.

1194
02:05:54,673 --> 02:05:56,743
You came back.

1195
02:05:59,193 --> 02:06:01,787
I always knew you were a good man.

1196
02:06:14,233 --> 02:06:16,906
Prepare to cast off. There's no time to lose.

1197
02:06:16,993 --> 02:06:19,348
Come on, Will. Step to!

1198
02:06:37,673 --> 02:06:40,028
It's after you, not the ship.

1199
02:06:40,113 --> 02:06:42,911
It's not us.

1200
02:06:42,993 --> 02:06:45,666
This is the only way, don't you see?

1201
02:06:48,833 --> 02:06:50,903
I'm not sorry.

1202
02:06:56,233 --> 02:06:58,144
Pirate.

1203
02:07:16,753 --> 02:07:18,869
Where's Jack?

1204
02:07:22,313 --> 02:07:26,101
He elected to stay behind to give us a chance.

1205
02:07:34,433 --> 02:07:36,185
Go!

1206
02:07:48,433 --> 02:07:51,709
Bugger. Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger!

1207
02:08:18,833 --> 02:08:20,869
Come on!

1208
02:08:24,953 --> 02:08:27,592
Just got it. Come on.

1209
02:08:55,473 --> 02:08:57,828
Not so bad.

1210
02:08:59,153 --> 02:09:00,188
Oh.

1211
02:09:08,673 --> 02:09:10,425
Hello, beastie.

1212
02:09:57,273 --> 02:10:01,312
Jack Sparrow, our debt is settled.

1213
02:10:02,593 --> 02:10:04,743
The captain goes down with his ship.

1214
02:10:04,833 --> 02:10:08,667
Turns out not even Jack Sparrow can best the devil.

1215
02:10:13,753 --> 02:10:16,221
Open the chest.

1216
02:10:17,313 --> 02:10:19,747
Open the chest. I need to see it!

1217
02:10:34,713 --> 02:10:40,470
Damn you, Jack Sparrow!

1218
02:10:46,033 --> 02:10:48,672
The last of our ships is returned.

1219
02:10:48,753 --> 02:10:51,062
Is there any news on the chest?

1220
02:10:51,153 --> 02:10:56,546
None. But one of the ships did pick up a man adrift at sea.

1221
02:10:56,633 --> 02:10:58,703
He had these.

1222
02:11:05,393 --> 02:11:08,430
I took the liberty of filling in my name.

1223
02:11:15,673 --> 02:11:19,586
If you intend to claim these, then you must have something to trade.

1224
02:11:19,673 --> 02:11:22,187
Do you have the compass?

1225
02:11:22,273 --> 02:11:24,025
Better.

1226
02:11:30,913 --> 02:11:33,347
The heart of Davy Jones.

1227
02:12:26,513 --> 02:12:28,868
Against the cold...

1228
02:12:28,953 --> 02:12:31,183
and the sorrow.

1229
02:12:41,033 --> 02:12:43,501
It's a shame.

1230
02:12:43,593 --> 02:12:45,948
I know you're thinking that with the Pearl

1231
02:12:46,033 --> 02:12:51,187
you could have captured the devil and set free your father's soul.

1232
02:12:51,273 --> 02:12:53,912
Doesn't matter now.

1233
02:12:53,993 --> 02:12:56,461
The Pearl is gone,

1234
02:12:56,553 --> 02:12:58,430
along with its captain.

1235
02:12:58,513 --> 02:13:00,629
Aye.

1236
02:13:00,713 --> 02:13:04,467
And already the world seems a bit less bright.

1237
02:13:04,553 --> 02:13:07,545
He fooled us all right till the end,

1238
02:13:07,633 --> 02:13:11,228
but I guess that honest streak finally won out.

1239
02:13:13,993 --> 02:13:15,665
To Jack Sparrow.

1240
02:13:15,753 --> 02:13:20,543
-Never another like Captain Jack. -He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.

1241
02:13:21,113 --> 02:13:23,104
He was a good man.

1242
02:13:42,953 --> 02:13:46,866
If there was anything could be done to bring him back...

1243
02:13:48,193 --> 02:13:50,423
-Elizabeth. -Would you do it?

1244
02:13:50,513 --> 02:13:51,741
Hm?

1245
02:13:52,953 --> 02:13:55,148
What would you...

1246
02:13:55,233 --> 02:13:56,825
Hm?

1247
02:13:58,513 --> 02:14:02,267
What would any of you be willing to do, hm?

1248
02:14:03,393 --> 02:14:07,147
Would you sail to the ends of the Earth and beyond

1249
02:14:07,233 --> 02:14:12,102
to fetch back witty Jack and him precious Pearl?

1250
02:14:17,993 --> 02:14:19,187
Aye.

1251
02:14:20,233 --> 02:14:21,507
Aye.

1252
02:14:22,113 --> 02:14:23,262
Aye.

1253
02:14:23,913 --> 02:14:25,551
Aye.

1254
02:14:28,433 --> 02:14:30,424
Yes.

1255
02:14:32,593 --> 02:14:33,787
Aye.

1256
02:14:33,873 --> 02:14:35,784
All right.

1257
02:14:36,793 --> 02:14:43,551
But if you go and brave the weird and haunted shores at world's end...

1258
02:14:44,593 --> 02:14:50,623
then you will need a captain who knows those waters.

1259
02:15:04,913 --> 02:15:08,906
So tell me, what's become of my ship?
