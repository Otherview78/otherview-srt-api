1
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,513
<i>This is Zero One Alpha.
We have secured Falcon.</i>

2
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,714
<i>I say again, we have secured Falcon.</i>

3
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,356
By the time I count to ten...

4
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,637
...you will have told me
exactly what I need to know.

5
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,110
If not...

6
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,157
...the number ten will be the
last thing you will ever hear.

7
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,350
One

8
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,153
Two

9
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,470
Three

10
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,590
Four

11
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:04,830
Five

12
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,870
Six

13
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,990
Seven

14
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,673
Eight

15
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,474
<i>Grenade! Sir, get back!</i>

16
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,161
Shit.

17
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,400
Fucking missed it.

18
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,992
How did I fucking miss it?

19
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,794
Merlin, I apologize for putting
you in this position.

20
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,515
You trained him well.

21
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,080
James...

22
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,312
training is over.

23
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,552
Welcome to Kingsman.

24
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,356
Lancelot.

25
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,511
Sir.

26
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,880
I'll deal with this mess personally.

27
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,033
<i>I very much regret that your husband's
bravery can't be publicly celebrated.</i>

28
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,516
I hope you understand.

29
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,195
How can I understand?

30
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,352
You won't tell me anything.

31
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,710
I didn't even know
he wasn't with his squad.

32
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,110
I'm so sorry, I can't say more.

33
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,559
But I would like to present you
with this Medal of Valor...

34
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:24,079
and if you look closely on the back,
there's a number.

35
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,956
And as a more concrete gesture
of our gratitude...

36
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,033
we'd like to offer you...

37
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,551
Let's call it a favor.

38
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,240
The nature of it is your choice.

39
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,755
Just tell the operator...

40
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,632
"oxfords not brogues,"
and then I'll know it's you.

41
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,641
I don't want your help!

42
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,191
I want my husband back!

43
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,236
What's your name, young man?

44
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,790
Eggsy.

45
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,235
Hello, Eggsy.

46
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,641
Can I see that?

47
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,398
You take care of this, Eggsy.

48
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,801
All right?

49
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:16,315
And take care of your mum, too.

50
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,836
So sorry, Professor Arnold.
Just a tiny bit more.

51
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,516
For God's sakes, just rip it off.

52
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,197
I'm under very strict instructions
not to hurt you.

53
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,631
Look, you've made a mistake.

54
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,555
I'm a university lecturer.
I've got no money.

55
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,200
This isn't about money.

56
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,318
Our boss just wants to talk to you.

57
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,393
Am I meant to find that reassuring?

58
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,678
He'll be here soon. He'll explain.

59
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,480
Do you like whiskey?

60
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,881
Red, get the '62 Dalmore.

61
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,239
Honestly, this whiskey, it's amazing.

62
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,359
You will shit.

63
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,033
I suppose asking to borrow
a cup of sugar is a step too far?

64
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,921
Professor Arnold,
I'm here to take you home.

65
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,553
1962 Dalmore.

66
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,793
It'd be a sin to spill any.

67
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,915
Don't you think?

68
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,798
Can you hold these? Please?

69
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,070
Thank you.

70
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,678
Everything is clean.

71
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,155
My kind of welcome.

72
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,678
No stomach for violence.

73
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,753
I mean, literally,
I see one drop of blood...

74
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,833
that is me done.

75
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,191
I'm like...

76
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,681
projectile.

77
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,037
Listen, I'm so sorry...

78
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:19,560
you had to witness all this unpleasantness
due to our uninvited guest.

79
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,880
But I promise you, by the time
I've found out who he works for...

80
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,354
you and I will be the best of friends.

81
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,998
To the shop, please.

82
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,630
Arthur's in the dining room, sir.

83
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,116
Arthur.

84
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,516
Galahad.

85
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:19,392
The others were beginning to wonder
if we were going to have a double toast.

86
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,041
Gentlemen, I'm thankful to
say it's been 17 years...

87
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,597
since we last had occasion
to use this decanter.

88
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,873
Lancelot was an outstanding agent,
and a true Kingsman.

89
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,481
He will be sorely missed.

90
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,031
To Lancelot.

91
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,520
To Lancelot.

92
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,590
I intend to start the selection process
for Lancelot's replacement tomorrow.

93
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,271
I want each of you
to propose a candidate...

94
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,797
and have them report to UK HQ...

95
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,118
no later than 9 p.m. GMT.

96
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,750
Thank you.

97
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,110
Merlin.

98
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,640
Come in.

99
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,676
Lancelot was investigating
a group of mercenaries...

100
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,561
who were experimenting
with biological weaponry.

101
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,790
Glasses, gentlemen, please.

102
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,711
Uganda, 2012.

103
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,400
Synthetic cathinones.

104
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,997
They put it in the water supply
of a guerrilla army base.

105
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,393
Rage, cannibalism, multiple fatalities.

106
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,240
Chechnya, 2013.

107
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,200
Insurgents turned on one another.

108
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:34,116
Indisputably, the work of our mercenaries,
but no trace of any chemicals of any kind.

109
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,430
So what happened to Lancelot?

110
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,399
He tracked them to this property
in Argentina.

111
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,876
While he had them under surveillance...

112
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,873
he became aware
they'd effected a kidnapping.

113
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,715
So he executed a solo rescue mission,
which failed.

114
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,115
This is his last transmission.

115
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,636
- Who is he?
- Some climate change doomsayer.

116
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,430
Expounds something
called "Gaia theory"...

117
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,234
about the world healing itself,
or some such.

118
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,281
But what's curious,
is he's not actually missing.

119
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,077
This is Professor Arnold...

120
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,278
at Imperial College this morning.

121
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,114
It's all yours.

122
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,597
And don't forget
your membership proposal.

123
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,833
Try picking a more suitable
candidate this time.

124
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,879
17 years and still...

125
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,671
evolving with the times remains
an entirely foreign concept to you.

126
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,919
Need I remind you, I wouldn't be here
if it weren't for that young man?

127
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,676
He was as much Kingsman
material as any of them.

128
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,036
More so.

129
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,234
But he wasn't exactly one of us, was he?

130
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,597
Let's face it, Galahad,
your little experiment failed.

131
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,796
With respect, Arthur, you're a snob.

132
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,071
"With respect"?

133
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,432
The world is changing.

134
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,595
There's a reason why aristocrats
developed weak chins.

135
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,350
Eggsy?

136
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,314
Eggsy, come here.

137
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,319
- Got any Rizla, babe?
- No.

138
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,518
Why don't you do your mum a favor,
go down to the shop and get some?

139
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,001
- Get them yourself.
- Oi.

140
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,801
What have I said to you
about speaking to Dean like that?

141
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,437
Three's a crowd, innit?
Why don't Dean's poodle go?

142
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,080
I'll tell you what.

143
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,994
Why don't you take this,
go and get some Rizlas...

144
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,110
get yourself some sweets?
And while you're gone...

145
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,074
we'll show your mother
how three can be good company.

146
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,670
Thanks, babe.

147
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,074
There we go.

148
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,276
Is that better?

149
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,431
If Dean treats your mum so bad,
why doesn't she leave him?

150
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,558
Low self-esteem. That's her problem.

151
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,510
Fuck off.
Why would she have low self-esteem?

152
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,479
Eggsy's mum is well fit.

153
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,992
- No offense, bruv.
- It's all right.

154
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,231
One of these days,
I'm gonna smash his face in.

155
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,835
Are you mental, cuz?

156
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,710
He'd just get that lot to do you,
and then pretend he knew nothing...

157
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,150
...about it.

158
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,877
You think you can chat shit about us
and we won't do nothing...

159
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,192
just because our guvnor's
banging Eggsy's mum?

160
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,193
Pretty much, yeah.

161
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,512
Bruv, just leave it.
Let's just go, man.

162
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,670
It's not worth it.

163
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,356
You boys have outstayed your welcome.

164
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,670
Leave.

165
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,431
What?

166
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,033
I'm sorry about that, bruv.

167
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,110
Yeah.

168
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,237
Mug.

169
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,512
They weren't fucking worth it, boys.

170
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,878
It's freezing.
Why are we walking?

171
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,873
You jacked his fucking car keys, bruv?

172
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:08,556
Yeah. Now, we're gonna nick his car.

173
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,561
Shit!

174
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,920
Hold on, boys.

175
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,159
Hey, that's my fucking car!

176
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,551
Hey! Hey! Eggsy!

177
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,758
I swear, you want to fucking stop it!

178
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,476
You're a fucking dead man! Stop it!

179
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,430
I'm gonna fucking have ya!

180
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,075
Floor it, Eggsy!

181
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,230
Floor it!

182
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,190
Wanker!

183
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,555
Yeah, Dean. Look, it's me.

184
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,712
Eggsy just stole my fucking car.

185
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,714
I've come out the pub,
he's done 15 donuts in my fucking face...

186
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,440
and he's drove off.

187
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,718
No, I can't have it!
He's disrespecting me.

188
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,077
And that means,
he's disrespecting you.

189
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,114
Hold up! What the...?

190
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,950
Dickhead.

191
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,753
Foxes are vermin, cuz.

192
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,355
Should've driven it over.

193
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,478
Should've done a lot of things.

194
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,314
I'll sort this. Get out of the car.

195
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,998
I said, get out of the fucking car!

196
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,958
<i>Eggsy, there is no such thing
as honor amongst thieves.</i>

197
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,671
Now, you can start giving me some names
of the boys you were with...

198
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,675
or you go down.

199
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,881
It's up to you.

200
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,790
I want to exercise
my right to a phone call.

201
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,872
Well, I hope it's to your mum...

202
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,557
to tell her you're gonna be
18 months late for your dinner.

203
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,877
<i>Customer Complaints, how may I help you?</i>

204
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,240
My name's Eggsy Unwin.

205
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,873
Sorry, Gary Unwin.
And I'm up shit creek.

206
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,350
I'm in Holborn police station...

207
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,154
and my mum said to call this number
if ever I needed help.

208
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,790
<i>I'm sorry, sir. Wrong number.</i>

209
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,321
Wait! Wait!

210
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,311
Oxfords not brogues.

211
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,550
<i>Your complaint has been duly noted...</i>

212
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,753
<i>and we hope that we have
not lost you as a loyal customer.</i>

213
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,151
Yeah.

214
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,081
You what?

215
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,477
I...

216
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,911
Yeah.

217
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,281
Yes, I totally understand.

218
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,876
Eggsy.

219
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,996
Would you like a lift home?

220
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,951
Who are you?

221
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,475
The man who got you released.

222
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,961
That ain't an answer.

223
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,477
A little gratitude would be nice.

224
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,952
My name is Harry Hart,
and I gave you that medal.

225
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,512
Your father saved my life.

226
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,918
So before you was a tailor,
was you in the army?

227
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,801
Like an officer.

228
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,480
Not quite.

229
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,439
So where was you posted,
Iraq or something?

230
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,877
Sorry, Eggsy. Classified.

231
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,475
But my dad saved your life, yeah?

232
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:48,037
The day your father died,
I missed something.

233
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,276
And if it weren't for his courage...

234
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,354
my mistake would have cost the lives
of every man present.

235
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,795
So I owe him.

236
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,998
Your father was a brave man.

237
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,999
A good man.

238
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,310
And having read your files...

239
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,791
I think he'd be bitterly disappointed
in the choices you've made.

240
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,190
You can't talk to me like that.

241
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,310
Huge I.Q.

242
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,239
Great performance at primary school.

243
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,481
And it all went tits up.

244
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,361
Drugs, petty crime.
Never had a job.

245
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,194
You think there's a lot of jobs
going around here, do you?

246
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,840
Doesn't explain
why you gave up your hobbies.

247
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,601
First prize,
regional Under-10s gymnastics...

248
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,990
two years in a row.

249
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,357
Your coach had you pegged
as Olympic team material.

250
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,194
Yeah, well, when you grow up around
someone like my stepdad...

251
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,840
you pick up new hobbies pretty quick.

252
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,719
Of course. Always someone else's fault.

253
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,150
Who's to blame
for you quitting the Marines?

254
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,671
You were halfway through training,
doing brilliantly, but you gave up.

255
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,832
Because my mum went mental.

256
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,800
Banging on about losing me
as well as my dad.

257
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,396
Didn't want me being cannon fodder
for snobs like you.

258
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,951
Judging people like me
from your ivory towers...

259
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,351
with no thought about
why we do what we do.

260
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,396
We ain't got much choice. You get me?

261
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,231
And if we was born with the same
silver spoon up our arses...

262
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,234
we'd do just as well as you.
If not, better.

263
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,234
What the fuck you doing here?
You taking the piss?

264
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,191
Some more examples of young men...

265
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,079
who simply need a silver suppository?

266
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,755
No, they're exceptions. Come on.

267
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,355
Nonsense.
We haven't finished our drinks.

268
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,591
After you nicked his car...

269
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,076
Dean says you're fair game.

270
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,830
He don't give a shit what your mum says.

271
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,241
Listen, boys...

272
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,598
I've had a rather emotional day...

273
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,074
so whatever your beef with Eggsy is,
and I'm sure it's well-founded...

274
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,920
I'd appreciate it enormously...

275
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,038
if you could just leave us in peace...

276
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,761
until I finish
this lovely pint of Guinness.

277
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,590
You should get out of the way, Granddad,
or you'll get hurt and all.

278
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,115
He ain't joking. You should go.

279
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,111
Excuse me.

280
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,030
If you're looking for another rent boy,
they're on the corner of Smith street.

281
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,916
Manners...

282
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,396
maketh...

283
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,675
man.

284
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,914
Do you know what that means?

285
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,952
Then let me teach you a lesson.

286
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,873
Are we going to stand around here all day,
or are we going to fight?

287
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,679
You fucking dirty, fucking dirty...

288
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,321
Sorry about that.

289
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,234
Needed to let off a little steam.

290
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:05,917
I heard yesterday a friend of mine died.

291
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,118
He knew your father too, actually.

292
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,758
Now, I do apologize, Eggsy.

293
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,912
I shouldn't have done this
in front of you.

294
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,072
No, please!
I won't say nothing, I swear!

295
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,760
If there's one thing I can do,
it's keep my mouth shut.

296
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,275
- You won't tell a soul?
- Ask the feds.

297
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,431
I've never grassed anyone up.

298
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,911
- Is that a promise?
- On my life!

299
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,953
Much appreciated, Eggsy.

300
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,874
You're right about the snobs.

301
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,271
But there, too, there are exceptions.

302
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,999
Best of luck with everything.

303
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:55,554
<i>In celebrity news, the Richmond Valentine
movie premiered in Hollywood last night.</i>

304
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,520
<i>The story of the internet billionaire's
rise to power...</i>

305
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,480
<i>is expected to be
this award season's hot ticket.</i>

306
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:04,634
<i>One notable absence from the red carpet
was Iggy Azalea...</i>

307
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,317
<i>still missing three days after she failed
to appear at her Oakland concert.</i>

308
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,040
<i>No ransom has been demanded.</i>

309
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,158
Eggsy, just go, please,
because he's gonna...

310
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,840
No, please, don't hurt him!

311
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,674
Fuck off! Get the fuck away with ya!

312
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,076
Shut the fuck up!

313
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,358
Who was with you in that fucking pub?

314
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:22,672
I want to know the name of the geezer
you was with.

315
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,673
- I wasn't with no one!
- Who was it?

316
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,241
- I don't know what you're on about.
- Who was it?

317
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,551
I don't know
who you're fucking on about!

318
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,836
Fucking tell me his name!

319
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,311
I don't know
who you're fucking on about!

320
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,551
<i>You listen to me!</i>

321
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,678
<i>I want to know who you was with in that pub.
Do you understand?</i>

322
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,719
<i>I want to know his fucking name!</i>

323
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,840
<i>Because, I swear,
I'll rip your head off.</i>

324
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:47,073
<i>- Tell me!
- I don't know what you're fucking on about!</i>

325
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,277
Just tell him, Eggsy!

326
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,239
Fuck off! Fuck off, Michelle!

327
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,676
I could kill you right now...

328
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,356
and no one in the whole world
will notice!

329
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,194
<i>But I would.</i>

330
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,193
I have enough evidence
on your activities...

331
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,352
to have you locked up
for the rest of your life...

332
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,751
- Mr. Dean Anthony Baker.
- What the fuck?

333
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,520
<i>So I suggest you leave the boy alone...</i>

334
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:08,271
<i>or I shall be forced to deliver it
to the appropriate authorities.</i>

335
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,841
<i>Eggsy, meet me at the tailor
I told you about.</i>

336
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,470
What the fuck's going on here?

337
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,636
Eggsy, you fucking maggot!

338
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,996
Hey, we got a racer!

339
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,640
Come here. Hey!

340
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,476
Eggsy, you fucking...

341
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,916
Come here, son!

342
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,431
You wanker!

343
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,240
I'll have you, son!

344
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,672
I've never met a tailor before.

345
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,841
But I know you ain't one.

346
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,474
Come with me.

347
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,436
Come on in.

348
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,151
What do you see?

349
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,673
Someone who wants to know
what the fuck is going on.

350
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,717
I see a young man with potential.

351
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,794
A young man who is loyal.

352
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,679
Who can do as he's asked.

353
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,640
And who wants to do
something good with his life.

354
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,232
Did you see the film <i>Trading Places?</i>

355
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,315
No.

356
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,235
<i>How about Nikita?</i>

357
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,641
<i>Pretty Woman?</i>

358
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,631
All right.

359
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,839
My point is, that the lack of a silver
spoon has set you on a certain path...

360
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,833
but you needn't stay on it.

361
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:09,917
If you're prepared to adapt and learn,
you can transform.

362
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,313
Like in <i>My Fair Lady.</i>

363
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,398
Well, you're full of surprises.

364
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,355
Yes, like <i>My Fair Lady.</i>

365
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,718
Only, in this case, I'm offering you
the opportunity to become a Kingsman.

366
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,721
A tailor?

367
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,521
A Kingsman agent.

368
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,356
Like a spy?

369
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,676
Of sorts.

370
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,670
Interested?

371
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,352
You think I've got anything to lose?

372
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,875
Since 1849...

373
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:49,194
Kingsman tailors have clothed
the world's most powerful individuals.

374
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:54,038
By 1919, a great number of them
had lost their heirs to World War One.

375
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:58,192
That meant a lot of money
going uninherited.

376
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:02,400
And a lot of powerful men with a desire
to preserve peace and protect life.

377
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,474
Our founders realized that they could
channel that wealth and influence...

378
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,280
for the greater good.

379
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:10,718
And so began our other venture.

380
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,871
An independent,
international intelligence agency...

381
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:17,398
operating at the highest level
of discretion.

382
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,680
Above the politics and bureaucracy...

383
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:24,040
that undermine the integrity
of government-run spy organizations.

384
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,117
The suit is a modern gentleman's armor.

385
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,033
And the Kingsman agents
are the new knights.

386
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,714
How deep does this fucking thing go?

387
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,917
Deep enough.

388
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,274
Shit, we're late.

389
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,476
Your father had the
same look on his face.

390
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,515
As did I.

391
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,316
Come on.

392
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,157
Galahad.

393
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,311
My code name.

394
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,960
Late again, sir.

395
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,641
Good luck.

396
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,321
In you go.

397
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,991
Fall in.

398
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:22,074
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Merlin.

399
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,311
You are about to embark...

400
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:26,201
on what is probably the most
dangerous job interview in the world.

401
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:31,877
One of you, and only one of you,
will become the next Lancelot.

402
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,873
Can anybody tell me what this is?

403
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,354
- Yes?
- Body bag, sir.

404
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,831
Correct. Charlie, isn't it?

405
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,030
Yes, sir.

406
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,832
Good.

407
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,357
In a moment,
you will each collect a body bag.

408
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,359
You will write your name on that bag.

409
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:50,953
You will write the details
of your next of kin on that bag.

410
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,398
This represents your acknowledgment
of the risks that you are about to face...

411
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:57,839
as well as your agreement
to strict confidentiality.

412
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,073
Which, incidentally, if you break,
will result in you...

413
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,671
and your next of kin...

414
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,720
being in that bag.

415
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,801
Is that understood?

416
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,471
Excellent.

417
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,356
Fall out.

418
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,071
Roxanne. But call me Roxy.

419
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,241
- I'm Eggsy.
- "Eggy"?

420
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,390
No, "Eggsy".

421
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,881
Eggy?

422
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,156
Where did they dig you up?

423
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,438
You know we're not allowed
to discuss who proposed us.

424
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,876
No need to bite his head off.

425
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,397
Charlie's only making conversation,
right, Charlie?

426
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,230
I'm Digby.

427
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,193
Digby.

428
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,761
Eggy, this is Rufus.

429
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,435
Rufus, Eggy.

430
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,400
So, Eggy, are you Oxford or Cambridge?

431
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,553
Neither.

432
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,041
- Saint Andrews?
- Durham?

433
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:52,113
No, wait, I think we may have met.

434
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:55,831
Did you serve me at the McDonald's
in Winchester service station?

435
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,950
No.

436
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,916
It's definitely Saint Andrews.

437
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,676
Just ignore them.

438
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,911
You need a pen?

439
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,832
Cheers.

440
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,401
Amelia, isn't it?

441
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,001
Amelia, Eggsy.

442
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,311
Hi, Eggsy.

443
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,434
Don't take any notice of those guys.

444
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,274
That's what I told him.

445
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,796
It's just scare tactics.

446
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,675
Classic army technique.

447
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,991
No one's gonna die.

448
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,356
Shame.

449
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,677
Great. You don't know,
the CIA don't know.

450
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,356
Nobody knows who this guy is?

451
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,111
Fine.

452
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,635
Seriously, it's fine.

453
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:38,676
Well, it's not really fine,
but it's not why I'm here.

454
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:42,317
Hell, man, you know me.
Money's not my issue.

455
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,199
I could've retired
straight out of MIT...

456
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,830
fucked off to some island,
let the business run itself.

457
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:49,755
Nobody told me
to try and save the planet.

458
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,560
I wanted to.

459
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:55,431
Climate change research,
lobbying, years of study, billions of dollars...

460
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,399
and you know why I quit?

461
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:02,597
Because the last time I checked,
the planet was still fucked.

462
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,436
Hence, my epiphany.

463
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,355
Money won't solve this.

464
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,190
Those idiots
who call themselves politicians...

465
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:15,400
have buried their heads in the sand
and stood for nothing but re-election.

466
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:20,514
So I spent the last two years
trying to find a real solution.

467
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,033
And I found it.

468
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,239
Now, if you really want to make
the world a better place...

469
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:31,873
I suggest you open your fucking ears,
because I'm about to tell it to you.

470
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,913
Go on, Mr. Valentine.

471
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,595
I'm still listening.

472
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:40,281
As long as you agree to all my terms.

473
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,995
All right, no one panic. Listen to me.

474
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,317
Stay calm.

475
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,150
Fuck.

476
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,515
Loo snorkels, loo snorkels!

477
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:37,790
Loo snorkels?

478
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,950
Showerheads!

479
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,832
Showerheads?

480
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:42,435
She's right. Fucking go!

481
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,876
Hey, hang about,
what's wrong with the fucking door?

482
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:13,360
Congratulations on completing
your first task.

483
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,281
Charlie, Roxy, well done.

484
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,239
For those of you
who are still confused...

485
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,597
if you can get a breathing tube
around a U-bend of a toilet...

486
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,593
you have an unlimited air supply.

487
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,230
Simple physics, worth remembering.

488
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,718
Eggsy, well done for spotting
that was a two-way mirror.

489
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:29,871
He's probably seen enough of them.

490
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,920
Yeah, you can all wipe those smirks
off your faces.

491
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:36,910
Because as far as I'm concerned,
every single one of you has failed.

492
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:40,319
You all forgot
the most important thing...

493
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,596
teamwork.

494
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,441
So much for classic army technique.

495
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,870
35.

496
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,915
105.

497
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,871
That's it. That's it.

498
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,470
Hello.

499
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,957
Can I help you?

500
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,518
Yes. I have a question
about anthropogenic force.

501
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,119
Really? It's actually quite fascinating.

502
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,640
My colleague died
trying to rescue you...

503
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,514
and I'm sure you saw
how well trained he was...

504
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:32,310
so I suggest you tell me who kidnapped
you and why they let you go.

505
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,194
I have no idea what you're talking...

506
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,231
I'm not supposed to say it, but it was...

507
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,314
For God's sake, I've barely touched you.

508
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,801
Man up!

509
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,553
Fuck that guy, whoever he is.
I'm gonna...

510
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,078
He made me kill Professor Arnold.

511
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,561
I goddamn loved Professor Arnold.

512
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,791
Well, the good news is...

513
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,759
we know the emergency
and surveillance system work.

514
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,878
You know what's not good news?

515
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,759
"My colleague died!"

516
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,321
That's what he said!

517
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,837
This is an organization,
and they're all over us.

518
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,834
- Whoever you spoke to...
- I told you...

519
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:25,551
I made contact with the KGB, MI6,
Mossad and Beijing.

520
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,310
They all insist he wasn't one of theirs.

521
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,836
Beijing.

522
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:33,514
So freaky how there's no recognizable name
for the Chinese secret service.

523
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,112
Now, that's what you call
a secret, right?

524
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,879
You know what? Fuck it.

525
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,920
We need to speed things up.

526
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,470
Bring the product release forward.

527
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,433
We're only halfway into production...

528
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,035
and speeding it will cost a fortune.

529
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,476
Do I look like I give a fuck?

530
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,553
Just get it done.

531
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,641
As some of you will
have learned last night...

532
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,279
teamwork is paramount here at Kingsman.

533
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:03,230
We're here to enhance your skills,
test you to the limit.

534
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:06,837
Which is why you're gonna pick a puppy.

535
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,833
Wherever you go, your dog goes.

536
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:11,197
You will care for it. You will teach it.

537
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,439
And by the time it's fully trained,
so will you be.

538
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:17,196
Those of you who are still here,
that is.

539
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,273
Do you understand?

540
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,359
Choose your puppy.

541
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,191
A poodle?

542
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,350
What?

543
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,034
They're gun dogs.

544
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,680
Oldest working breed.

545
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,634
Easy to train.

546
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,956
A pug?

547
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,994
It's a bulldog, innit?

548
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,830
It'll get bigger, though, won't it?

549
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,838
Shit.

550
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:52,152
His MRI shows no signs of concussion.

551
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:55,320
No direct brain trauma at all.

552
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,712
How much longer can he be out?

553
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,031
That's the million-dollar question.

554
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,039
We don't know
what he was exposed to in there.

555
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,675
What about Harry's footage?

556
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,514
It didn't stream to his home terminal.

557
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:07,640
Encrypted and uncrackable.

558
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,070
If and when he comes around...

559
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,796
you might want to have a word with him
about sharing his password.

560
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,640
Is he gonna be all right?

561
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,480
We need to have patience, Eggsy.

562
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,241
But there's hope, okay?

563
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,514
If I were you,
I'd concentrate on your training.

564
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,872
Make it through the tests.
Make him proud.

565
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,000
Come on, come on, come on!

566
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,232
J.B., come on! Come on!

567
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,352
I'm not coming last because of you.

568
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,670
J.B., I'll shoot you!
Goddamn you, I'll fucking shoot you!

569
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,594
Merlin said we're not
allowed to hold you.

570
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,275
Bollocks.

571
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:32,790
Water!

572
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,560
- Come on, then!
- Eggsy, forget it!

573
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,350
What's wrong, mate?
You can't take a joke?

574
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,552
Seriously, you'll get thrown out,
and it's just not worth it.

575
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,240
Maybe I don't give a fuck
if I get kicked out!

576
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,755
Do it. Come on, you pleb.

577
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,321
Charlie, fuck off!

578
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,400
Yeah, go on, walk away. Dickhead.

579
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,831
Come on, J.B.

580
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,071
Come on, good boy.

581
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:11,271
You have exactly one hour
to complete the test...

582
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,000
starting now.

583
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,799
<i>New target, 800 meters.</i>

584
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,594
<i>You know, it's unbelievable.
You're still here...</i>

585
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,277
lingering like some
big, steaming shit that just won't flush.

586
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,955
Roger that. Target identified.

587
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,112
And how about you shut the fuck up?

588
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,396
Positive discrimination...

589
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,995
that's what it is.

590
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:32,313
It's like those fucking state school kids
who get into Oxford on C grades...

591
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,150
because their mum
is a one-legged lesbian.

592
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,870
You don't know fuck all about my grades.

593
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,839
Forgive me,
I'm sure you're highly educated.

594
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:39,480
Fire when ready.

595
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,632
How's that for positive discrimination?

596
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,119
I want to thank you both
for listening...

597
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:01,353
and I really, really appreciate
you travelling all this way...

598
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,511
Your Royal Highness.

599
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,474
And you, too, Prime Minister.

600
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:07,679
I think this is quite brilliant.

601
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,676
It's absolutely brilliant.

602
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:14,274
You are completely crazy.

603
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,880
And as for you, Prime Minister

604
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,197
I'm speechless you'd even consider this.

605
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:28,480
- Don't touch...
- Sorry, Your Royal Highness.

606
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:29,677
But you've got a big role to play...

607
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:32,401
in getting the Scandinavian
region back on track.

608
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,075
You're popular, inspirational...

609
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:36,676
and you have the power
to galvanize the people.

610
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:39,674
Now, whether you're on board or not...

611
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,480
I'm going to have to insist...

612
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:44,520
on getting you somewhere
I can ensure your safety.

613
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:47,237
How about you, Prime Minister?
You in or out?

614
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,715
Well, I think it's about time...

615
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:54,558
that a politician did something
that actually made a difference.

616
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,873
Too true.

617
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:57,872
What?

618
00:43:58,030 --> 00:43:59,361
Take her away.

619
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:04,030
Drink?

620
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:06,395
Why not?

621
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:10,278
Guards! Help!

622
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,078
Don't worry.

623
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,715
No harm will come to the princess.

624
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:17,360
Well, I'm a republican anyways,
so it really doesn't matter.

625
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:19,870
Release the princess!

626
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,751
Okay, you're done.

627
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:56,435
Not so bad, right?

628
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,793
Hardly felt a thing.

629
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:00,600
Welcome aboard.

630
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,913
Pleasure is all mine.

631
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:10,231
Ever heard of knocking?

632
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:12,870
Only when I'm casing a place to rob.

633
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,590
Merlin said you wanted to see me?

634
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,798
I hope J.B.'s training
is going as well as yours is.

635
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:20,117
Sit.

636
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:25,520
Congratulations on making it
to the final six candidates.

637
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:28,150
Your test results were even better
than I could've hoped.

638
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:31,951
Come in.

639
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,801
Eggsy, I need to have
a private conversation.

640
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:39,950
You're dismissed.

641
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,794
Nonsense. Let him observe.

642
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,634
Might learn a thing or two.

643
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,152
As you wish. Take a look at this.

644
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,119
<i>For God's sake, I've barely touched you.</i>

645
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,270
<i>Man up!</i>

646
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,474
Fucking hell!

647
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,598
That is rank, Harry.

648
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,675
You blew up his head?

649
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:57,275
It's a bit much, innit?

650
00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:01,116
Actually, the explosion was caused
by an implant in his neck.

651
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:02,835
Here, under the scar.

652
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:05,676
Did my hardware
pick up the signal that triggered it?

653
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,355
Fortunately, yes.

654
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,638
Unfortunately,
the IP address I traced it to...

655
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:11,997
is registered
to the Valentine Corporation.

656
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,994
That's not much of a lead.
He has millions of employees worldwide.

657
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,352
That Richmond Valentine is a genius.

658
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:23,157
Did you not see his announcement today?

659
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:25,036
No.

660
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:32,631
<i>We each spend on average
$2,000 a year...</i>

661
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:34,719
<i>on cell phone and internet usage.</i>

662
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:37,999
<i>It gives me great pleasure
to announce...</i>

663
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:40,721
<i>those days are over.</i>

664
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:41,917
<i>As of tomorrow...</i>

665
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:45,916
<i>every man, woman and child
can claim a free SIM card...</i>

666
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:50,200
<i>compatible with any cell phone,
any computer...</i>

667
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:54,554
<i>and utilize my communications network
for free.</i>

668
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:56,041
<i>Free calls...</i>

669
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,720
<i>free internet...</i>

670
00:46:57,870 --> 00:46:59,395
for everyone.

671
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:01,721
<i>Forever.</i>

672
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:20,235
Valentine's assistant
has the same implant scar.

673
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:23,401
I think Mr. Valentine and I
should have a tête-à-tête.

674
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,390
He's having a gala dinner next week.

675
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:32,394
I'll get you an invitation.
You need to be careful, though.

676
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:34,558
Since you've been out,
hundreds of VIPs have gone missing.

677
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:37,077
No ransom notes,
exactly like Professor Arnold.

678
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:41,151
Then I suggest you make my alias
somebody worth kidnapping.

679
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,111
<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck!</i>

680
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:56,431
<i>What, don't like heights?</i>

681
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:57,591
<i>Yeah, it's okay.</i>

682
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:01,437
<i>I've done it before, which is probably why,
come to think of it.</i>

683
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:04,639
<i>Hey, it's gonna be all right.</i>

684
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:06,235
<i>You're top of the class.</i>

685
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:09,470
<i>Listen up.</i>

686
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:12,440
<i>Your mission is to land in the target
without the radar detecting you.</i>

687
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:16,276
If I read you on the radar,
or you miss the target, you go home.

688
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:17,791
Is that understood?

689
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:23,916
<i>Drop zone coming up, 20 seconds.</i>

690
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:26,681
<i>We gotta go.</i>

691
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,839
<i>Eggsy, I really don't think
I can do this.</i>

692
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:38,991
<i>Of course you can't.</i>

693
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:40,910
<i>Head to the back
and I'll show you how, yeah?</i>

694
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,992
<i>Eggsy, wait! Hang on!</i>

695
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:53,515
<i>Roxy, just stop fucking about!</i>

696
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:56,110
<i>Follow me, yeah?</i>

697
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:12,033
<i>Come on!</i>

698
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:15,358
<i>Roxy, it's now or never.</i>

699
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:17,870
<i>Jump!</i>

700
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:37,841
<i>Good girl, Rox...</i>

701
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:39,594
<i>I'm glad you made it!</i>

702
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,074
<i>Yeah!</i>

703
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:55,711
<i>Come on!</i>

704
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:00,238
My, my, you're all very cheerful.

705
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:02,671
Did you really think it was gonna be
that straightforward?

706
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,117
Any idiot can read a heads-up display.

707
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:08,956
A Kingsman agent needs to be able
to solve problems under pressure.

708
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:13,032
Like what to do when one of
your group has no parachute.

709
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:16,080
<i>- What, no parachute?
- Shit!</i>

710
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:17,596
<i>Who?</i>

711
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:18,592
<i>Fuck!</i>

712
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:19,750
<i>Which one?</i>

713
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:21,315
<i>What do we do?</i>

714
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:22,881
<i>I told you. Aim for the target.</i>

715
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:24,316
<i>Come in under the radar.</i>

716
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:26,438
And I hope not to be scraping
one of you up.

717
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,760
But if I do have to,
and you're inside the target...

718
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:31,954
please know I'll be very impressed.

719
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,561
<i>- Fuck!
- Oh, shit!</i>

720
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:39,114
<i>Everybody listen, I've got a plan!</i>

721
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,800
<i>Pair off!
Grab the closest person to them.</i>

722
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:47,636
<i>Rufus, come on!</i>

723
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:48,830
<i>Fuck!</i>

724
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:50,630
<i>Rufus!</i>

725
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:52,111
<i>Shit! I can't!</i>

726
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:56,950
<i>Fuck!</i>

727
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:59,116
<i>Thank God!</i>

728
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,113
<i>Rufus, you wanker!</i>

729
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,761
<i>Shit, we're an odd number now!</i>

730
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:05,911
<i>Quick, make a circle!</i>

731
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:07,799
<i>Fuck, he's right! Boys, let's do it.</i>

732
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,592
<i>We pull our cords one by one!</i>

733
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:15,990
<i>When we know who's fucked...</i>

734
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,630
<i>the person on their right grabs them.</i>

735
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:20,510
<i>Okay, Eggsy.</i>

736
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:21,991
<i>Good plan, Eggsy.</i>

737
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:24,312
You have 30 seconds.
Come on now, hurry.

738
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:25,471
<i>Me first!</i>

739
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:28,832
<i>Fuck!</i>

740
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:30,321
<i>Yes!</i>

741
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:34,796
<i>Okay, me next.</i>

742
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:38,315
<i>See you on the ground, boys.</i>

743
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:43,151
<i>Now me.</i>

744
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:48,030
<i>Fuck!</i>

745
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:53,318
<i>Roxy...</i>

746
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:55,510
<i>No matter what happens now,
I've got you, all right?</i>

747
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:00,316
<i>Okay, Eggsy.</i>

748
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:01,631
<i>- Yours first, okay?
- Yep.</i>

749
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:15,830
Shit!

750
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:24,750
<i>Shit!</i>

751
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:27,870
<i>Shit!</i>

752
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:30,550
<i>Rox!</i>

753
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:35,116
<i>Fuck.</i>

754
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:53,637
<i>Hugo, Digby.</i>

755
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:56,600
You don't land in the K,
you're not in the K.

756
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:59,071
Rufus, you opened too soon.

757
00:52:59,230 --> 00:53:00,595
You were all over the radar.

758
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,593
All three of you,
pack your bags, go home.

759
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:06,917
Eggsy, Roxy, congratulations.

760
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:08,880
You set a new record.

761
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:10,270
Opening at 300 feet...

762
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:11,477
that's pretty ballsy.

763
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:14,156
Well done for completing another task.
Fall out.

764
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:16,271
Sorry, sir.

765
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:18,114
But why the fuck did you
choose me as the gimp?

766
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:19,476
Am I the expendable candidate?

767
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:22,236
No, no, no.
You don't talk to me like that.

768
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,950
You have a complaint, you come here
and you whisper it in my ear.

769
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:34,161
You need to take
that chip off your shoulder.

770
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:07,630
Mr. DeVere.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

771
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:11,001
I'm awfully sorry.
I seem to have my dates muddled up.

772
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:14,040
No, no, no.
I cancelled the gala because of you.

773
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,159
Anybody willing to donate that much...

774
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:18,472
deserves their own dinner.
Come in!

775
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:21,111
Thank you.

776
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:25,516
Got to admit,
I was really intrigued to meet you.

777
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:27,513
There aren't many billionaires
I don't know.

778
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:28,671
I don't doubt it.

779
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:31,834
And, obviously,
I had my people look into your affairs...

780
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:33,750
and that's some pretty old money
you're from.

781
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:34,870
How'd your folks make it?

782
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:38,354
Property, mostly.
Property and the markets.

783
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:40,558
Nothing questionable,
if that's your concern.

784
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:43,475
Look, I'm just into finding out
what caliber person you are.

785
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:44,790
I'm sure you understand that.

786
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,077
I most certainly do.

787
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:47,720
- Hope you're hungry.
- I'm famished.

788
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:48,957
Good.

789
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:50,031
Grab a seat.

790
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:12,990
I'll have the Big Mac, please.

791
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:14,236
Great choice.

792
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:17,792
But nothing beats two cheeseburgers
with secret sauce.

793
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:19,759
Goes great with this '45 Lafite.

794
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:20,911
A classic pairing.

795
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:24,354
And may I suggest Twinkies
and a 1937 Château d'Yquem for pudding?

796
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:26,555
I like it.

797
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:30,950
So, you want to donate to my foundation.

798
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:34,432
You are aware that I wound things
down in that area, right?

799
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:37,514
Climate change is a threat,
which affects us all, Mr. Valentine.

800
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:40,839
And you're one of the few powerful men
who seems to share my concerns.

801
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:43,675
No, I shut things down,
because I wasn't getting anywhere.

802
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:46,674
Every bit of research
kept pointing to the same thing.

803
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,195
That carbon emissions
are a red herring...

804
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:52,036
and that we're past the point of no return
no matter what remedial actions we take?

805
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:54,034
You know your shit.

806
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:57,797
I sometimes envy the blissful ignorance
of those less well versed in their...

807
00:55:58,350 --> 00:55:59,556
"shit."

808
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,160
As Professor Arnold always said...

809
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:05,156
"Humankind is the only virus
cursed to live...

810
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:08,553
"with the horrifying knowledge
of its host's fragile mortality."

811
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:12,361
You know, not a lot of people
knew about him.

812
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:17,437
You like spy movies, Mr. DeVere?

813
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:24,159
Nowadays, they're all a little
serious for my taste.

814
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:25,310
But the old ones...

815
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:27,310
Marvelous.

816
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:29,751
Give me a far-fetched
theatrical plot any day.

817
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:33,437
The old Bond movies. Oh, man!

818
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:37,117
When I was a kid, that was my dream job.

819
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,514
Gentleman spy.

820
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:43,238
I always felt the old Bond films
were only as good as the villain.

821
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:47,720
As a child, I rather fancied a future
as a colorful megalomaniac.

822
00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:52,912
What a shame we both had to grow up.

823
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:58,750
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

824
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:04,240
Just give me a couple of days
to think over your proposal.

825
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:05,994
I'll have my people
get in touch with yours...

826
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:07,675
and it's all good.

827
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:11,357
And thank you for such a happy meal.

828
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:18,075
Well, want me to follow him?

829
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:19,396
Nah.

830
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:22,116
I put a nano tracker gel in the wine.

831
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:25,314
We'll know his every move
for the next 24 hours.

832
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:28,041
Finally find out who he works for.

833
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:31,558
Valentine didn't let me
out of his sight.

834
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:34,236
All I got was this on the way in.

835
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:41,433
South Glade Mission Church
is a hate group based in Kentucky.

836
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:43,914
FBI have been monitoring them for years.

837
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:45,879
But you think Valentine is a supporter?

838
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:49,318
No evidence yet of a direct connection,
but I'll keep looking.

839
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:51,601
By the way...

840
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:56,790
our ever-growing list of missing persons
now includes Scandinavian royalty.

841
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:59,921
Royal Crown Princess Tilde.

842
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:04,834
Just let me out, you psycho!

843
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:07,834
I told you, you're free to go
any time you want.

844
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:10,277
As long as you agree to my conditions.

845
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:12,320
I don't agree...

846
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:15,201
and I am never ever going to agree!

847
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:16,590
Tough shit.

848
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:18,031
Bitch.

849
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:21,954
I want to speak to the British Council!

850
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:26,999
<i>The list of missing celebrities and dignitaries
has continued to grow in recent weeks...</i>

851
00:58:27,150 --> 00:58:31,041
<i>and world leaders are coming under
increasing pressure to provide answers.</i>

852
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:34,956
<i>We are doing everything in our power
to find Princess Tilde.</i>

853
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:38,273
<i>You know,
governments and security forces worldwide...</i>

854
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:42,156
<i>are working together to find the person
behind these abductions.</i>

855
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:44,030
<i>In other news,
people all over the world...</i>

856
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:48,553
<i>continue to wait in line day and night
to get their free SIM cards.</i>

857
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:51,190
Mrs. P, did you get one?

858
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,921
Yeah, I've been queuing up all day.

859
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:58,354
<i>This unprecedented giveaway
by the philanthropist Richmond Valentine...</i>

860
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:01,354
<i>has already seen
over a billion cards distributed.</i>

861
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:02,750
At ease.

862
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:07,311
So you thought we were done
for the day, huh?

863
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:09,316
Well, we're not.

864
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:12,952
- A party?
- Tonight, in London.

865
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:17,031
- Who's this?
- Your target.

866
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:19,158
Your mission
is to use your NLP training...

867
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:21,750
to win over the individual
on the photograph in your envelope.

868
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:23,395
And when I say "win over"...

869
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:25,360
I do mean in the biblical sense.

870
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:26,671
Easy.

871
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:29,638
Posh girls love a bit of rough.

872
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:31,440
We'll see about that, yeah?

873
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:33,519
We certainly will.

874
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:39,710
Hi!

875
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:43,158
Sorry, I just had to come over
and say, amazing eyes.

876
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:44,750
Are you wearing color contacts?

877
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:47,117
- No!
- You so are.

878
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:49,671
Oh, my God, negging! That's hilarious.

879
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:51,719
I haven't heard anyone try that
since the noughties.

880
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:52,996
Excuse me?

881
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:54,150
"Negging."

882
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:58,161
Saying something negative to a pretty girl
in order to undermine her social value.

883
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:00,392
It's supposed to make you
want to win his approval.

884
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:03,999
Absurdly basic
neuro-linguistic programming technique.

885
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:06,312
Is it just me, or does this champagne
taste a little bit funny?

886
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,359
- It's an acquired taste, mate.
- I think it's just cheap.

887
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:10,353
Get one of these instead.
They're delicious.

888
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:13,241
If you're into seduction techniques,
this guy is textbook.

889
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:16,155
See what he just did?
It's called an opinion opener.

890
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:17,800
He got you talking
with a neutral question...

891
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:19,750
got all of us involved
in the conversation...

892
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:21,514
so that you craved individual attention.

893
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:23,561
No, I'm just saying
the champagne tastes rank.

894
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:25,474
Lady Sophie Montague-Herring.

895
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:26,961
Phone call for you at reception.

896
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:28,950
- Be right back.
- We'll see you in a bit, yeah?

897
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:30,355
See you in a bit.

898
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:32,353
Budge up, Rox. I'm feeling a bit rough.

899
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:34,035
- Are you all right?
- No.

900
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:35,237
Sorry to eavesdrop...

901
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:38,951
but there's a much easier way
to guarantee getting someone home.

902
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:40,720
Rohypnol.

903
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:44,634
Or even something stronger.

904
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:03,874
Who the fuck are you?

905
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:05,875
Where am I?

906
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:09,431
This knife...

907
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:11,672
can save your life.

908
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:16,911
Fuck!

909
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:20,120
My employer's got two questions
for you, Eggsy.

910
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:22,159
What the fuck is Kingsman?

911
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:23,960
And who's Harry Hart?

912
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:25,953
I don't know who the fuck that is!

913
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:26,918
Shit!

914
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:30,870
Eggsy, I just killed two of your friends
who gave me the same bullshit answer!

915
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:32,510
Fuck!

916
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:35,441
Just cut the fucking ropes, please!

917
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:36,637
Hey, Eggsy!

918
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:38,155
Is Kingsman worth dying for?

919
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:41,715
Fuck you!

920
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:57,316
Congratulations.

921
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:58,710
Bloody well done.

922
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:02,594
How did the others do?

923
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:04,559
Roxy passed with flying colors.

924
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:07,357
Charlie's up next. Want to watch?

925
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,195
Yeah, all right.

926
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:14,758
Is Kingsman really worth dying for?

927
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:16,275
No, it fucking isn't!

928
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:18,273
Shit, I'll tell you what you want.
Please!

929
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:19,716
Chester King is Arthur.

930
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,111
Arthur's head of a spy agency.
It's called Kingsman.

931
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:23,950
- Get me out of here!
- Thank you, Charlie.

932
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,321
Much appreciated.

933
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:27,871
Come on!
That wasn't the fucking deal!

934
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:30,557
Fuck!

935
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:39,871
I had such high hopes for you.

936
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:41,993
You're a bloody disgrace.

937
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:43,151
Arthur, I'm sorry.

938
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:45,321
At least untie me.

939
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:47,001
Untie yourself.

940
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:50,832
Arthur, please.

941
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:54,721
<i>I'm the fucking son of the... Shit!</i>

942
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:57,396
<i>Anyone? Hello?</i>

943
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:00,121
Galahad, Percival, congratulations.

944
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:03,200
Your candidates have reached
the final stage of the testing process.

945
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:06,911
As tradition allows,
you now have 24 hours to spend with them.

946
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:10,673
Eggsy, you should know your
father reached this point.

947
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:12,431
From now on...

948
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:14,390
there are no safety nets, understood?

949
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,230
Good. Dismissed.

950
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:25,198
Charlie, time to go home.

951
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:26,715
<i>Fuck you.</i>

952
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:29,397
Fucking dad's gonna hear about this!

953
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:32,551
"To pee or not to pee?"

954
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:35,632
That was the headline...

955
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:38,395
the day after I defused
a dirty bomb in Paris.

956
01:03:39,030 --> 01:03:40,714
"Germany, 1, England, 5."

957
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:41,951
Missed that game.

958
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:45,120
I was breaking up an undercover
spy ring at the Pentagon.

959
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:51,921
My first mission.

960
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:53,870
Foiled the assassination
of Margaret Thatcher.

961
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:56,750
Not everybody would
thank you for that one.

962
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:59,561
The point is, Eggsy,
nobody thanked me for any of them.

963
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:03,791
Front page news on all these occasions
was celebrity nonsense.

964
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:07,631
Because it's the nature of Kingsman
that our achievements remain secret.

965
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:11,438
A gentleman's name should appear
in the newspaper only three times.

966
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:13,911
When he's born, when he marries,
and when he dies.

967
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:17,279
And we are, first and foremost,
gentlemen.

968
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:18,921
That's me fucked then.

969
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:21,799
It's like Charlie said. I'm just a pleb.

970
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:22,951
Nonsense.

971
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:26,070
Being a gentleman has nothing to do
with the circumstances of one's birth.

972
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:28,433
Being a gentleman
is something one learns.

973
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:31,033
Yeah, but how?

974
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:33,190
All right, first lesson.

975
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:35,150
You should've asked me
before you took a seat.

976
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:37,791
Second lesson...

977
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:40,121
how to make a proper martini.

978
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:43,192
Yes, Harry.

979
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:48,839
Goddamn it! This fucking hurts!

980
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:51,836
You're the one who asked
for a biometric security system.

981
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:53,116
What's wrong with a simple switch?

982
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:54,271
A simple switch?

983
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:58,111
This is an extremely dangerous machine.

984
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:02,838
It should only be operated by someone
as responsible and sane as me.

985
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:05,317
Bad shit could happen
if this falls into the wrong hands.

986
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:10,194
We done here? Shit!

987
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:13,001
No. Now this one.

988
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:14,230
For the test at the church.

989
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:16,193
This one just has a short range.

990
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:17,920
A simple switch will do.

991
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:26,760
So are you gonna teach me how to
talk proper, like in <i>My Fair Lady?</i>

992
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:28,355
Don't be absurd.

993
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:31,196
Being a gentleman has nothing
to do with one's accent.

994
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:33,671
It's about being at ease
in one's own skin.

995
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:35,400
As Hemingway said,
"There is nothing noble...

996
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:37,917
"in being superior to your fellow man.

997
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:41,832
"True nobility is being superior
to your former self."

998
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:48,872
Now, the first thing every
gentleman needs is a good suit.

999
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:52,358
By which I mean, a bespoke suit.
Never off-the-peg.

1000
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:54,911
And Kingsman suits
are always bulletproof.

1001
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:57,880
So let's get you measured,
and then, whether you get the job or not...

1002
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:02,399
you'll have a lasting and useful memento
of your time at Kingsman.

1003
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:06,191
I'm so sorry, sir, but a gentleman
is completing his fitting.

1004
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:08,557
Fitting Room Two is available.

1005
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:12,715
One does not use Fitting Room Two
when one is popping one's cherry.

1006
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:16,600
Perhaps I'll show you Fitting Room Three
while we wait.

1007
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:28,236
So we going up or down?

1008
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:29,551
Neither.

1009
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:31,791
Is this it?

1010
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:35,073
Of course not.
Pull the hook on your left.

1011
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:43,310
Oh, yes.

1012
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:45,757
Very, very nice.

1013
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:51,270
You're going to need a pair of shoes
to go with your suit.

1014
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:55,594
An oxford is any formal shoe
with open lacing.

1015
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:58,959
This additional decorative piece
is called broguing.

1016
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:00,316
"Oxfords not brogues."

1017
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:02,074
Words to live by, Eggsy.

1018
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:04,916
Words to live by. Try a pair.

1019
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:07,434
Your weapon scores are excellent,
by the way.

1020
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:11,833
These you are familiar with,
and this is our standard issue pistol.

1021
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:13,634
It's quite unique, as you'll see.

1022
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:17,158
It also fires a shotgun cartridge
for use in messy close-range situations.

1023
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:18,755
- How do they feel?
- Yeah, good.

1024
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:20,281
Now do your very best impersonation...

1025
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:22,114
of a German aristocrat's
formal greeting.

1026
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:26,870
No, Eggsy.

1027
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:32,230
That is sick.

1028
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:35,238
In the old days,
they had a phone in the heel as well.

1029
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:36,471
How do I get it back in?

1030
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:40,521
Well, it's coated in one of the fastest
acting neurotoxins known to man...

1031
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:42,160
so very carefully.

1032
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:47,791
Now, I've had a lot of fun with this.

1033
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:50,954
One of our finest examples
of chemical engineering.

1034
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,630
A poison, harmless when ingested...

1035
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:55,679
but at a time convenient to you...

1036
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:59,835
can be remotely activated. Primed.

1037
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:02,310
Lethal.

1038
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:05,638
What about these?
What do these do?

1039
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:07,998
- Electrocute you?
- Don't be ridiculous.

1040
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:09,993
- It's a hand grenade.
- Shut up!

1041
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:12,590
If you want to electrocute someone,
you'll need a signet ring.

1042
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,712
A gentleman traditionally
wears the signet on his left hand.

1043
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:17,840
But a Kingsman wears it on
whichever hand happens to be dominant.

1044
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:19,430
Touch the contact behind the ring...

1045
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:20,636
it delivers 50,000 volts.

1046
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:24,996
And what about them?
What makes them so special?

1047
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:26,151
Nothing.

1048
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:29,035
That technology has caught up
with the spy world.

1049
01:08:30,030 --> 01:08:31,839
Put it back, Eggsy.

1050
01:08:34,230 --> 01:08:35,675
<i>Perfect timing.</i>

1051
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:37,719
The gentleman's just finished.

1052
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:44,201
Mr. DeVere!

1053
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:47,354
What a coincidence.

1054
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:50,880
You are totally the reason I'm here.

1055
01:08:51,070 --> 01:08:52,196
When you left my house...

1056
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:56,150
I was thirsting for that dope-ass
smoking jacket you had on.

1057
01:08:56,310 --> 01:08:57,835
And since I'm going to Royal Ascot...

1058
01:08:57,990 --> 01:09:00,150
and, apparently,
you need one of these penguin suits...

1059
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:01,751
here I am.

1060
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:03,357
What are you doing here?

1061
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:04,921
What's up, man?

1062
01:09:05,070 --> 01:09:06,196
Richmond Valentine.

1063
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:09,554
This is my new valet.
I was just introducing him to my tailor.

1064
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:12,554
Another coincidence. So am I.

1065
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:15,110
Have you had any chance
to think further on my proposal?

1066
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:16,191
Most definitely.

1067
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:19,394
My people will be getting
in touch with you very soon.

1068
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:21,040
I guarantee it.

1069
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:23,075
A word of advice.

1070
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:25,597
Ascot requires top hat.

1071
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:29,753
I might suggest Lock and Co. Hatters.

1072
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:31,597
Saint James's.

1073
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:33,030
"Lox" as in smoked fish?

1074
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:35,921
As in, "locked up."

1075
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:41,874
I have trouble understanding
you people sometimes.

1076
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:44,552
You all talk so funny.

1077
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:54,633
Gentlemen, would you look after him,
please?

1078
01:10:07,150 --> 01:10:08,436
Now this...

1079
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:10,479
is a dope-ass top hat.

1080
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:15,438
Gazelle, let's go ascoting.

1081
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:18,156
<i>Your hat looks fine, Gazelle.</i>

1082
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:21,154
<i>Come on!
Don't make me late for the queen.</i>

1083
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:24,595
<i>Come on, Gazelle!
We're gonna be late.</i>

1084
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:26,275
<i>How far is Ascot?</i>

1085
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:27,797
<i>How far?</i>

1086
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:33,510
Merlin said you wanted to see me, sir?

1087
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:35,315
Sit down.

1088
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:41,750
Pretty dog.

1089
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:43,476
What's his name?

1090
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:44,631
J.B.

1091
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:46,997
- As in "James Bond"?
- No.

1092
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:48,760
"Jason Bourne"?

1093
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,952
No. "Jack Bauer."

1094
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:52,317
Oh!

1095
01:10:52,990 --> 01:10:53,991
Bravo.

1096
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:55,791
It pains me to admit it...

1097
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:58,840
but I think that one day,
you might be as good a spy...

1098
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:00,435
as any of them.

1099
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:09,160
Take it.

1100
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:17,230
Shoot the dog.

1101
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,316
This weapon is live.

1102
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:29,510
Shoot the dog.

1103
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,237
Give me the gun.

1104
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:22,279
At least the girl's got balls.

1105
01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:26,911
Get out.

1106
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:29,592
I knew you couldn't make it.

1107
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:34,201
Go home.

1108
01:12:35,710 --> 01:12:38,554
Merlin, send in Roxy, please.

1109
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:05,314
Welcome to Kingsman...

1110
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:07,396
Lancelot.

1111
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:31,751
Mum!

1112
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:33,316
Eggsy!

1113
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:34,796
Oh, God. Where have you been?

1114
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:36,992
I've been so worried about you.

1115
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:42,193
Oh, my days. Look how big you've grown!

1116
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:50,038
- Where is he?
- I'm fine.

1117
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:51,874
Eggsy, please, just don't get involved.

1118
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:53,714
I should never have left you
on your own.

1119
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:56,271
This stops right now.

1120
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:57,551
I'll be right back.

1121
01:13:57,710 --> 01:13:59,314
Eggsy.

1122
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:03,001
Oi, Dean!

1123
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:05,833
Mugsy, so you're back.

1124
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:07,879
What, you gone and nicked
a fucking taxi, now?

1125
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:09,481
Yeah.

1126
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:11,678
Can I have a word
about my mum's black eye?

1127
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:14,399
You want to have a word with me,
you get out of that cab...

1128
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:16,710
I'll knock you straight back down
on your fucking arse.

1129
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:20,472
Tell your muppets to go inside,
then I'll get out.

1130
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,673
Go on, lads. It'll be two hits.

1131
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:26,878
Me hitting him, him hitting the floor.

1132
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:29,717
Come on, then, you prick.

1133
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:31,759
Let's see what you got.
Want a bit of me?

1134
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:32,718
What are you doing?

1135
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:33,870
No, no, no!

1136
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:34,718
Get out of the fucking car!

1137
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:36,759
What are you doing?
Where you going, you mug?

1138
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:38,196
Go on, you got no bollocks!

1139
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:40,992
Come on, bruv, he hit my fucking mum!

1140
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:42,561
Come back when you've grown a pair!

1141
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:43,710
Mugsy!

1142
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:07,471
You throw away...

1143
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:11,641
your biggest opportunity
over a fucking dog.

1144
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:14,951
And then you humiliate me
by stealing my boss's car.

1145
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:17,272
You shot a dog
just to get a fucking job.

1146
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:18,711
Yes, I did.

1147
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:25,601
And Mr. Pickle here reminds me of that
every time I take a shit!

1148
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:29,670
You shot your dog and had it stuffed?

1149
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:31,070
You fucking freak.

1150
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:32,595
No, I shot my dog...

1151
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:34,434
and then I brought him home
and continued to care for him...

1152
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:37,036
for the next 11 years
until he died of pancreatitis.

1153
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:40,401
- What?
- It was a blank, Eggsy.

1154
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:43,234
It was a fucking blank.

1155
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:45,395
Remember Amelia?

1156
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:46,312
Yeah.

1157
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:47,596
She didn't drown.

1158
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:50,521
She works in our tech department in Berlin.
She's fine.

1159
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:51,916
Limits must be tested...

1160
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:54,721
a Kingsman only condones
the risking of a life to save another.

1161
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:57,840
Like my dad saved your life
even though your fuck-up cost his.

1162
01:15:57,990 --> 01:15:59,674
Or have you got him
stuffed here and all?

1163
01:16:01,710 --> 01:16:04,793
Can't you see that everything I've done
has been about trying to repay him?

1164
01:16:10,590 --> 01:16:12,274
Harry, listen to this.

1165
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:14,230
Valentine is at last
saying something of note.

1166
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:16,831
<i>Do you know what I love
about pen and paper?</i>

1167
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:19,830
Nobody can hack into this shit.

1168
01:16:20,270 --> 01:16:23,592
Our worldwide tour
was a complete success.

1169
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:26,236
We have total coverall.

1170
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:29,200
Like when all your numbers in bingo
are crossed out.

1171
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:30,350
Bingo?

1172
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:33,792
Bingo, the game.
You have played bingo, right?

1173
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:36,434
Do I look like I play bingo?

1174
01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:39,717
Point is...

1175
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:44,833
if our tests go well at the church tomorrow,
we are good to go.

1176
01:16:44,990 --> 01:16:47,516
South Glade Mission Church.

1177
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:50,592
- Merlin, get the plane ready.
<i>- Will do.</i>

1178
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:52,510
Harry, I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna do whatever...

1179
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:53,551
You should be.

1180
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:56,350
You just stay right there.
I'll sort this mess out when I get back.

1181
01:17:02,510 --> 01:17:04,239
<i>And I say to you...</i>

1182
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:05,630
bear witness!

1183
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:08,401
Watch the news. Watch the news.

1184
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:09,881
AIDS!

1185
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:11,152
Floods!

1186
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:13,438
The blood of the innocent, spilled!

1187
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:18,796
And yet, there are those who doubt
this is the wrath of God.

1188
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:27,320
Our filthy government condones
sodomy, divorce, abortion!

1189
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:29,996
And yet, some still doubt...

1190
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:34,041
this is the work of the antichrist!

1191
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:39,111
You do not have to be
a Jew, a nigger, a whore...

1192
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:42,035
or an atheistic, science-loving
evolution spouter...

1193
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:43,795
<i>Charming sermon.</i>

1194
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:45,640
Can you see Valentine anywhere?

1195
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:47,241
So, my friends...

1196
01:17:47,390 --> 01:17:50,439
although he is a just God,
he is justly a vengeful one...

1197
01:17:50,590 --> 01:17:53,560
and there can be no turning back...

1198
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:55,354
<i>from the almighty wrath...</i>

1199
01:17:55,510 --> 01:17:57,000
Are you sure we're out of range?

1200
01:17:57,230 --> 01:17:58,830
We're over 1,000 feet away.
What's wrong?

1201
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:00,190
What if the calculations are wrong?

1202
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:01,954
You just have to trust me.

1203
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:07,633
...Jew, nigger, fag lovers,
and the devil is burning them...

1204
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:09,076
for all eternity.

1205
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:10,431
Would you excuse me?

1206
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:12,430
Where are you going?

1207
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:14,879
Hey! What's your problem?

1208
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:17,881
I'm a Catholic whore...

1209
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:21,631
currently enjoying congress out of wedlock
with my black, Jewish boyfriend...

1210
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:24,361
who works in a military abortion clinic.

1211
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,281
So, hail Satan...

1212
01:18:26,590 --> 01:18:28,433
and have a lovely afternoon, madam.

1213
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:33,241
Oh, shit. He's leaving.

1214
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:34,994
I'm starting the test now.

1215
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:37,512
Let's hope enough of these freaks
have our SIM cards.

1216
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:43,200
I kindly ask you to sit down,
my friend!

1217
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:44,431
Just leave this church!

1218
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:46,957
You just leave this church
like the infidel you are!

1219
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:52,719
Satan cannot save you now!
You will eat your babies.

1220
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:56,397
You will drown in the blood of the Lord!

1221
01:18:56,550 --> 01:18:57,995
He will not save you!

1222
01:19:04,230 --> 01:19:05,231
Holy fuck!

1223
01:19:06,990 --> 01:19:09,152
Shit, I can't watch this. Get over here.

1224
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:53,352
Jeez! Fuck.

1225
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:56,158
<i>Galahad, can you hear me?</i>

1226
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:57,550
Harry!

1227
01:19:57,950 --> 01:20:00,317
Harry, what the heck is going on?

1228
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:03,030
Could you turn the volume down, please?

1229
01:20:04,270 --> 01:20:06,238
I didn't expect it to be that effective.

1230
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:07,870
What kind of response are we talking?

1231
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:09,431
100 percent.

1232
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:13,554
So, everyone's been affected,
whether they have a SIM card or not.

1233
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:16,150
And we get the added benefit
of wiping out the Kingsman.

1234
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:18,593
Not yet.

1235
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:14,881
You need to see this.

1236
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:13,753
What did you do to me?

1237
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:15,714
I had no control.

1238
01:23:17,070 --> 01:23:18,515
I killed all those people.

1239
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:21,676
I wanted to.

1240
01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:22,951
Clever, isn't it?

1241
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:25,841
In simple terms,
it's a neurological wave...

1242
01:23:25,990 --> 01:23:27,630
that triggers
the centers of aggression...

1243
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:29,394
and switches off inhibitors.

1244
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:32,874
Transmitted through your nasty,
free SIM cards, I assume.

1245
01:23:36,110 --> 01:23:37,999
Do you know what this is like?

1246
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:41,478
It's like those old movies we both love.

1247
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:44,713
Now, I'm going to tell you
my whole plan...

1248
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:48,158
and then I'm going to come up with some
absurd and convoluted way to kill you...

1249
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:50,916
and you'll find an equally
convoluted way to escape.

1250
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:53,480
Sounds good to me.

1251
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:56,358
Well, this ain't that kind of movie.

1252
01:23:59,990 --> 01:24:02,470
No!

1253
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:12,314
Is he dead?

1254
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:14,950
That tends to happen
when you shoot someone in the head.

1255
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:16,276
It feels good, right?

1256
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:18,870
No, no, it does not feel good.
It feels fucking awful.

1257
01:24:18,990 --> 01:24:21,277
What? You just killed
how many people in that church?

1258
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:22,470
This is one guy.

1259
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:24,592
No, no, they killed each other.

1260
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:29,393
Okay, send out the countdown clock.

1261
01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:32,235
This party starts tomorrow.

1262
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:08,281
Arthur?

1263
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:11,880
Are you there?

1264
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:14,352
<i>Sadly, I am.</i>

1265
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:18,192
Assemble the Kingsmen.

1266
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:26,035
<i>Can't you see that everything I've done
has been about trying to repay him?</i>

1267
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:48,917
<i>I see a young man with potential...</i>

1268
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:52,395
<i>who wants to do something
good with his life.</i>

1269
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:11,391
Arthur, Harry's dead.

1270
01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:14,471
Galahad is dead.

1271
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:17,071
Hence, we have just drunk
a toast to him.

1272
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:20,276
Well, then you know
what that psycho's doing.

1273
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:23,081
How many people around the world
have got those SIM cards?

1274
01:26:23,230 --> 01:26:25,631
Valentine can send his signal
to any of them, all of them.

1275
01:26:25,790 --> 01:26:27,838
If they all go homicidal
at the same time then...

1276
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:30,311
Indeed, and thanks
to Galahad's recordings...

1277
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:33,076
we have Valentine's confession.

1278
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:36,638
The intelligence has been passed on
to the relevant authorities.

1279
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:38,155
Our work is complete...

1280
01:26:38,310 --> 01:26:42,759
and a most distinguished legacy
for our fallen friend, it is, too.

1281
01:26:43,590 --> 01:26:44,751
And that's it?

1282
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:47,111
Come sit down, boy.

1283
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:55,476
This is an 1815 Napoleonic brandy.

1284
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:59,798
And we only drink it
when we lose a Kingsman.

1285
01:27:00,430 --> 01:27:03,479
Galahad was very fond of you.

1286
01:27:05,630 --> 01:27:08,031
And on this occasion...

1287
01:27:08,190 --> 01:27:11,558
I think it's acceptable for us
to bend the rules a little.

1288
01:27:13,950 --> 01:27:15,111
Are these all Kingsmen?

1289
01:27:15,310 --> 01:27:17,631
Yes, they're founder members.

1290
01:27:18,990 --> 01:27:21,072
I want you to join me in a toast.

1291
01:27:23,310 --> 01:27:25,312
To Galahad.

1292
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:27,800
To Galahad.

1293
01:27:32,350 --> 01:27:35,001
Harry says you don't like
to break rules, Arthur.

1294
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:36,551
Why now?

1295
01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:37,990
You're very good, Eggsy.

1296
01:27:38,150 --> 01:27:41,757
Perhaps I will make you my proposal
for Galahad's position.

1297
01:27:42,670 --> 01:27:45,355
Provided, of course,
that we can see eye to eye...

1298
01:27:45,550 --> 01:27:47,678
on certain political matters.

1299
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:52,035
Can you guess...

1300
01:27:53,150 --> 01:27:54,754
what this is?

1301
01:27:54,910 --> 01:27:56,594
I don't have to. Harry showed me.

1302
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:58,275
You click it. I die.

1303
01:27:58,430 --> 01:28:00,239
I thought that brandy tasted a bit shit.

1304
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:03,190
Bravo.

1305
01:28:03,510 --> 01:28:06,673
Valentine won you over, somehow.

1306
01:28:06,830 --> 01:28:09,674
Once he explained, I understood.

1307
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:11,110
<i>When you get a virus...</i>

1308
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:12,596
you get a fever.

1309
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:16,800
That's the human body raising
its core temperature to kill the virus.

1310
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:19,191
Planet Earth works the same way.

1311
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:21,273
Global warming is the fever.

1312
01:28:21,430 --> 01:28:24,240
Mankind is the virus.

1313
01:28:24,390 --> 01:28:26,791
We're making our planet sick.

1314
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:29,556
A cull is our only hope.

1315
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:31,951
If we don't reduce
our population ourselves...

1316
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:34,716
there is only one of two ways
this can go.

1317
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:39,114
The host kills the virus,
or the virus kills the host.

1318
01:28:39,430 --> 01:28:40,430
Either way...

1319
01:28:41,350 --> 01:28:42,920
The result is the same.

1320
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:44,714
The virus dies.

1321
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:49,237
So Valentine's gonna take care
of the population problem himself.

1322
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:51,916
Well, if we don't do something,
nature will.

1323
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:56,394
Sometimes a culling is the only way
to ensure that this species survives...

1324
01:28:57,110 --> 01:28:59,238
and history will see Valentine...

1325
01:28:59,390 --> 01:29:01,677
as the man who saved
humanity from extinction.

1326
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:05,598
And he gets to pick and choose
who gets culled, does he?

1327
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:06,956
All his rich mates, they get to live...

1328
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:09,636
and anyone he thinks is worth saving,
he's keeping them safe...

1329
01:29:09,790 --> 01:29:11,758
whether they agree with him or not.

1330
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:14,072
And you, Eggsy.

1331
01:29:14,630 --> 01:29:16,598
In Harry's honor...

1332
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:21,438
I am inviting you
to be part of a new world.

1333
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:25,797
It's time to make your decision.

1334
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:34,638
I'd rather be with Harry.

1335
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:36,270
Thanks.

1336
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:38,315
So be it.

1337
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:57,873
The problem with us common types...

1338
01:29:58,030 --> 01:29:59,634
is that we're light-fingered.

1339
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:02,559
Kingsman's taught me a lot...

1340
01:30:02,710 --> 01:30:03,950
but sleight of hand...

1341
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:06,394
Yes, they're founder members.

1342
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:10,316
I had that down already.

1343
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:16,237
You dirty little fucking...

1344
01:30:16,390 --> 01:30:17,835
prick.

1345
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:53,839
It's okay, Lancelot. Put it down.

1346
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:56,555
It's verified.

1347
01:30:58,950 --> 01:31:01,521
Arthur's phone is receiving update
texts about getting to safety.

1348
01:31:01,670 --> 01:31:03,434
- We don't have a lot of time.
- What are you going to do?

1349
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:05,752
The question is,
what are we going to do?

1350
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:08,641
God knows who's in Valentine's pocket
and who's not.

1351
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:10,795
We have no choice.

1352
01:31:11,870 --> 01:31:13,952
We are gonna have to deal
with this ourselves.

1353
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:18,721
Follow me.

1354
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:38,921
What the fuck is this?

1355
01:31:39,070 --> 01:31:40,913
I have no idea.

1356
01:31:41,910 --> 01:31:43,071
What you're playing with...

1357
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:45,961
is a prototype personal
transatmospheric vehicle.

1358
01:31:46,110 --> 01:31:48,397
It was developed as part of
Reagan's Star Wars project.

1359
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:51,474
It's pretty basic,
but it should still work.

1360
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:54,117
We're gonna take out
one of Valentine's satellites.

1361
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:56,956
We're gonna break the chain,
stop the signal.

1362
01:31:57,110 --> 01:31:59,030
It'll take him a couple of hours
to reroute it...

1363
01:31:59,470 --> 01:32:03,839
which buys us enough time for you
to get me into Valentine's mainframe...

1364
01:32:03,990 --> 01:32:05,799
so I can shut it down.

1365
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:08,271
Lancelot, you're going to be using it.

1366
01:32:08,430 --> 01:32:09,795
Get into your halo suit.

1367
01:32:22,430 --> 01:32:24,550
<i>Swedish Prime Minister,
requesting permission to land.</i>

1368
01:32:30,190 --> 01:32:31,954
<i>Permission granted.</i>

1369
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:38,030
- Please.
- Thank you.

1370
01:32:38,190 --> 01:32:40,272
- How many more are we expecting?
- Not many.

1371
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:41,801
Most have their own bunkers.

1372
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:45,318
I figure we're just getting
the really nervous ones.

1373
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:47,552
Welcome, Prime Minister.

1374
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:51,800
It seems the implant
can emit some kind of counter signal...

1375
01:32:51,950 --> 01:32:55,636
to ensure the wearer remains unaffected
by the waves from the SIM cards.

1376
01:32:55,790 --> 01:32:57,838
The waves that turn everyone
into a psycho killer.

1377
01:32:58,030 --> 01:33:00,556
Quite. But what he
probably didn't tell anyone...

1378
01:33:00,710 --> 01:33:04,999
is it can also super heat
their soft tissue at his command.

1379
01:33:05,150 --> 01:33:09,314
Valentine selected his chosen few
to get the countdown warning...

1380
01:33:09,470 --> 01:33:12,314
but he had to be sure they didn't blab
to the wrong people beforehand.

1381
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:14,199
How does this help us right now?

1382
01:33:15,150 --> 01:33:16,151
It doesn't.

1383
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:17,915
Roxy, here we go!

1384
01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:34,437
The higher you go,
the more the balloons expand.

1385
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:36,433
When you reach
the edge of the atmosphere...

1386
01:33:36,590 --> 01:33:38,718
they'll explode.

1387
01:33:38,870 --> 01:33:40,872
You'll need to deploy your missile
just before that, okay?

1388
01:33:41,070 --> 01:33:42,401
Edge of the atmosphere.

1389
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:45,872
And once you've deployed,
you'll need to release for descent, fast.

1390
01:33:46,870 --> 01:33:48,110
Good luck.

1391
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:52,432
- You can do this, okay?
- Yeah.

1392
01:33:52,590 --> 01:33:55,400
Eggsy, come on. Time is not our friend.

1393
01:34:17,870 --> 01:34:19,872
You're getting in
on Arthur's invitation.

1394
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:21,276
You're gonna need to blend in.

1395
01:34:21,430 --> 01:34:22,556
I'm supposed to be Arthur?

1396
01:34:22,710 --> 01:34:25,714
His invitation is in his phone.
You give them this.

1397
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:28,390
- Give his real name, Chester King.
- What about you?

1398
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:29,995
I'm your pilot.
I'm gonna stay here.

1399
01:34:31,070 --> 01:34:32,151
Is that gonna fit me?

1400
01:34:32,310 --> 01:34:34,836
A bespoke suit always fits.

1401
01:34:34,990 --> 01:34:36,799
Just be grateful
Harry had it made for you.

1402
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:38,751
Get dressed.

1403
01:34:40,190 --> 01:34:41,470
What the fuck's wrong with them?

1404
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:44,321
I don't know. Could have something to do
with the mass genocide.

1405
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:46,433
Give me the mic.

1406
01:34:48,230 --> 01:34:49,800
<i>Hey-oh!</i>

1407
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:52,874
<i>Everybody, listen up! Hello, hello!</i>

1408
01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:55,271
<i>What the fuck is wrong with you people?</i>

1409
01:34:55,430 --> 01:34:58,274
<i>I just wanna remind you that today...</i>

1410
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:01,036
<i>is a day of celebration.</i>

1411
01:35:01,830 --> 01:35:05,357
<i>We must put aside
all thoughts of death...</i>

1412
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:07,399
<i>and focus on birth.</i>

1413
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:10,916
<i>The birth of a new age.</i>

1414
01:35:12,110 --> 01:35:17,071
<i>We mustn't mourn those
who give their lives today.</i>

1415
01:35:17,230 --> 01:35:19,198
<i>We should honor their sacrifice...</i>

1416
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:21,352
Has she got my number to call me back?
I got a new phone.

1417
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:24,713
<i>...and their roles in saving
the human race.</i>

1418
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:30,796
<i>We must put aside doubt and guilt.</i>

1419
01:35:32,190 --> 01:35:35,751
<i>You are the chosen people.</i>

1420
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:40,837
<i>When folks tell their kids
the story of Noah's Ark...</i>

1421
01:35:40,990 --> 01:35:41,990
<i>is Noah the bad guy?</i>

1422
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:42,799
No!

1423
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:44,998
<i>Is God the bad guy?</i>

1424
01:35:45,150 --> 01:35:45,799
No!

1425
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:48,391
<i>How about the animals
marching two by two?</i>

1426
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:49,358
No!

1427
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:50,510
<i>Of course not!</i>

1428
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:52,795
<i>Yeah, that's it!</i>

1429
01:35:52,950 --> 01:35:56,750
<i>Let's turn those frowns upside down.</i>

1430
01:35:56,910 --> 01:35:58,753
<i>Eat, drink...</i>

1431
01:35:58,910 --> 01:36:00,594
<i>and Party!</i>

1432
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:06,156
<i>And I will see you all in the new age.</i>

1433
01:36:31,390 --> 01:36:33,518
<i>Rox, it's me.</i>

1434
01:36:34,030 --> 01:36:35,361
<i>How's the view?</i>

1435
01:36:38,190 --> 01:36:40,272
- Hideous
<i>- Mine's pretty sweet.</i>

1436
01:36:40,430 --> 01:36:43,354
- They made you one of these suits yet?
<i>- No, not yet.</i>

1437
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:45,871
<i>You've got something to
look forward to then.</i>

1438
01:36:46,030 --> 01:36:48,636
<i>We're coming up on Valentine's base.
Gotta go.</i>

1439
01:36:50,070 --> 01:36:51,401
<i>Good luck.</i>

1440
01:36:59,030 --> 01:37:00,031
Looking good, Eggsy.

1441
01:37:02,710 --> 01:37:05,441
Feeling good, Merlin.

1442
01:37:10,710 --> 01:37:12,314
<i>This is November-2-4-7-Charlie-Kilo.</i> ..

1443
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:14,916
<i>Requesting permission to land.</i>

1444
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:20,436
<i>Permission is granted.</i>

1445
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:25,919
Fuck me.

1446
01:37:53,110 --> 01:37:55,556
Eggsy, we're on.

1447
01:38:10,270 --> 01:38:11,271
Chester King.

1448
01:38:12,270 --> 01:38:14,238
Mr. King, welcome.

1449
01:38:14,630 --> 01:38:18,430
I'm sure you've adhered to Valentine's
strict no-weapons policy...

1450
01:38:18,590 --> 01:38:19,921
- but if you don't object...
- Of course.

1451
01:38:20,070 --> 01:38:21,310
Thank you.

1452
01:38:21,790 --> 01:38:23,918
Do you have any luggage?

1453
01:38:24,910 --> 01:38:28,357
Congratulations, Mycroft,
you just graduated from my pilot to my valet.

1454
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:31,430
- You cheeky...
Understood?

1455
01:38:31,590 --> 01:38:32,830
Good.

1456
01:38:34,150 --> 01:38:35,754
Thank you.

1457
01:39:01,030 --> 01:39:05,672
<i>Eggsy, find a laptop, get me online.
The clock is ticking.</i>

1458
01:39:06,830 --> 01:39:09,561
<i>And remember, try to blend in.</i>

1459
01:39:09,710 --> 01:39:11,678
Would sir care for a drink?

1460
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:13,516
Martini.

1461
01:39:13,670 --> 01:39:15,832
Gin, not vodka, obviously.

1462
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:19,716
Stirred for 10 seconds while glancing
at an unopened bottle of vermouth.

1463
01:39:20,350 --> 01:39:21,556
Thank you.

1464
01:39:24,350 --> 01:39:26,159
Merlin, are you clocking this?

1465
01:39:26,350 --> 01:39:28,398
Yes, I am. Stay focused.

1466
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:31,192
Lancelot, you're doing great.
Not much further to go.

1467
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:33,036
<i>Yes, Merlin.</i>

1468
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:36,837
<i>Eggsy, get me online now.</i>

1469
01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:38,751
Yep, I'm on it.

1470
01:39:39,910 --> 01:39:42,038
Lancelot, you're approaching
your altitude limit.

1471
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:44,154
<i>Those balloons won't last much longer.</i>

1472
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:46,998
<i>Prepare to engage missile.</i>

1473
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:03,596
Society's dead.

1474
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:05,913
Long live society.

1475
01:40:06,910 --> 01:40:08,241
Amen to that.

1476
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:11,758
- I'm Morten Lindström.
- Chester King.

1477
01:40:12,070 --> 01:40:13,401
How'd you get online? I couldn't.

1478
01:40:13,790 --> 01:40:16,760
It's a closed network, you see.
Pre-authorized connections only.

1479
01:40:20,950 --> 01:40:22,236
<i>I've got a fix on the satellite.</i>

1480
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:23,590
<i>Do you have the correct time?</i>

1481
01:40:23,710 --> 01:40:24,916
I think I'm still in my last time zone.

1482
01:40:25,070 --> 01:40:26,481
Yeah, yeah. Let's see now.

1483
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:41,551
Eggsy, I'm in.

1484
01:40:41,710 --> 01:40:42,836
Get your arse back to the plane, now.

1485
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:44,560
<i>- On my way.</i>
- Lancelot, good luck!

1486
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:46,917
Firing in 3... 2...

1487
01:40:54,270 --> 01:40:55,271
Nice and slow.

1488
01:40:55,430 --> 01:40:56,636
Fuck are you doing here?

1489
01:40:56,790 --> 01:40:59,111
Well, my family were invited, obviously.

1490
01:40:59,270 --> 01:41:00,920
Now, get the fuck up! Slowly.

1491
01:41:02,110 --> 01:41:03,999
Shit. Lancelot, hurry up and fire!

1492
01:41:04,150 --> 01:41:05,754
<i>That other balloon is gonna blow!</i>

1493
01:41:05,910 --> 01:41:08,959
<i>Yes, Merlin. I've nearly got it.
Give me a second!</i>

1494
01:41:10,830 --> 01:41:13,754
Valentine! I've caught a fucking spy!

1495
01:41:14,430 --> 01:41:15,477
V-Glass, zoom.

1496
01:41:15,630 --> 01:41:17,678
Oh, fuck! It's that young valet.

1497
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:23,201
Son of a bitch.

1498
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:24,876
<i>Got it!</i>

1499
01:41:34,990 --> 01:41:36,276
Oh, shit. Sound the alarm!

1500
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:39,910
I'm not taking any chances.

1501
01:41:40,030 --> 01:41:41,670
Okay, you send out
the two-minute warning.

1502
01:41:41,710 --> 01:41:44,156
I'm starting the override.
All right, let's do this.

1503
01:41:45,510 --> 01:41:47,114
<i>Countdown initiated.</i>

1504
01:41:56,830 --> 01:41:58,514
- You see him?
- Right here.

1505
01:42:07,310 --> 01:42:08,550
Eggsy, take a left.

1506
01:42:09,350 --> 01:42:10,351
Two guards, up ahead.

1507
01:42:22,710 --> 01:42:23,996
Lancelot! Release now!

1508
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:36,839
<i>Eggsy, straight ahead, then right.</i>

1509
01:42:37,230 --> 01:42:38,231
<i>There's two more.</i>

1510
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:44,038
<i>All right, everybody on your feet!</i>

1511
01:42:44,190 --> 01:42:45,396
<i>Countdown to V-day!</i>

1512
01:42:45,550 --> 01:42:47,075
<i>Welcome in the new age!</i>

1513
01:42:55,430 --> 01:42:56,511
<i>Flat spin.</i>

1514
01:43:11,710 --> 01:43:14,554
<i>Eggsy, next left,
down the narrow tunnel!</i>

1515
01:43:23,310 --> 01:43:24,311
Here we go!

1516
01:43:24,470 --> 01:43:25,470
10...

1517
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:27,441
<i>9...</i>

1518
01:43:27,950 --> 01:43:28,950
<i>8...</i>

1519
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:30,590
<i>7...</i>

1520
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:32,510
<i>6...</i>

1521
01:43:33,190 --> 01:43:34,271
5...

1522
01:43:34,870 --> 01:43:35,870
<i>4...</i>

1523
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:37,872
<i>3...</i>

1524
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:39,030
2...

1525
01:43:39,790 --> 01:43:40,790
1!

1526
01:43:46,710 --> 01:43:48,553
Nice! Well done, both of you.

1527
01:43:49,270 --> 01:43:50,271
It's not working!

1528
01:43:50,470 --> 01:43:52,518
It's supposed to be working!
What the fuck?

1529
01:43:59,310 --> 01:43:59,959
<i>Yes!</i>

1530
01:44:00,150 --> 01:44:01,481
Well done, Rox. Good girl.

1531
01:44:04,830 --> 01:44:07,356
We've lost one of our satellites.

1532
01:44:16,910 --> 01:44:20,676
Oh, no, no.
There's no way I can hack past that.

1533
01:44:26,230 --> 01:44:27,231
What's going on?

1534
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:29,511
Is there a problem?

1535
01:44:30,670 --> 01:44:32,030
Come on. There's no need for guns.

1536
01:44:32,150 --> 01:44:33,675
I'm just a pilot.

1537
01:44:36,670 --> 01:44:37,717
Fuck. Merlin!

1538
01:44:40,510 --> 01:44:42,114
Get in here!

1539
01:44:46,350 --> 01:44:47,511
Come on!

1540
01:44:51,070 --> 01:44:52,401
Let's get the fuck out of here!

1541
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:53,551
We can't.

1542
01:44:53,710 --> 01:44:55,200
I can't get into Valentine's machine.

1543
01:44:55,350 --> 01:44:56,954
He's got biometric security.

1544
01:44:58,430 --> 01:45:01,752
You're gonna have to get in there and make
sure his hand never touches that desk.

1545
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:03,435
Are you taking the fucking piss?

1546
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:04,870
I'm afraid not.

1547
01:45:08,030 --> 01:45:09,031
Let's have that then.

1548
01:45:10,710 --> 01:45:12,041
This is mine.

1549
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:14,473
I'll show you yours.

1550
01:45:31,790 --> 01:45:32,790
Good choice.

1551
01:45:35,430 --> 01:45:37,030
How long to re-link the satellite chain?

1552
01:45:37,150 --> 01:45:38,390
It'll take an hour, maybe two.

1553
01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:40,678
Bullshit! Just bring these two
closer together.

1554
01:45:40,830 --> 01:45:42,161
But that's not yours.

1555
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:49,594
V-Glass, call E-man.

1556
01:45:50,390 --> 01:45:51,755
E, it's V.

1557
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:53,912
Listen, man,
I got a little hiccup on this end.

1558
01:45:54,070 --> 01:45:55,071
I need to piggyback.

1559
01:45:55,230 --> 01:45:59,280
One of my satellites just went down,
but it's right next to one of yours.

1560
01:45:59,790 --> 01:46:01,280
You read my mind.

1561
01:46:01,910 --> 01:46:03,514
How long before you make that happen?

1562
01:46:06,590 --> 01:46:07,637
Go.

1563
01:46:11,790 --> 01:46:13,758
All right, we should be
coming back online.

1564
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:17,670
10 percent.

1565
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:21,518
Shit!

1566
01:46:21,710 --> 01:46:23,474
Eggsy, Valentine's using
someone else's satellite.

1567
01:46:23,670 --> 01:46:25,638
<i>He's going to reconnect the chain.</i>

1568
01:46:25,790 --> 01:46:27,310
<i>It's going to take him no time at all.</i>

1569
01:46:28,190 --> 01:46:29,271
It's at 20 percent.

1570
01:46:47,230 --> 01:46:50,473
Eggsy, it seems Valentine's got a present for you.
Get a move on!

1571
01:47:23,990 --> 01:47:25,401
Is that Kingsman kid dead yet?

1572
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:27,240
Not yet, but he will be soon.

1573
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:29,119
Good.

1574
01:47:42,030 --> 01:47:43,031
Merlin, I'm fucked.

1575
01:47:56,230 --> 01:47:57,231
As am I.

1576
01:47:57,430 --> 01:47:59,751
They're coming at me from both sides.
I'm out of options.

1577
01:48:00,190 --> 01:48:03,034
Rox, I need a favor.

1578
01:48:03,190 --> 01:48:04,271
Call my mum.

1579
01:48:04,430 --> 01:48:06,030
Tell her to lock herself away from Dean.

1580
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:07,750
<i>And the baby...</i>

1581
01:48:09,270 --> 01:48:10,271
and tell her I love her.

1582
01:48:19,230 --> 01:48:20,470
For fuck's sake.

1583
01:48:24,830 --> 01:48:27,993
Merlin, remember those implants
you said were of no use to us?

1584
01:48:29,790 --> 01:48:31,070
Any chance you can turn them on?

1585
01:48:34,670 --> 01:48:35,432
All right.

1586
01:48:35,630 --> 01:48:38,076
My turn to play, Valentine.

1587
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:47,751
Oh, no!

1588
01:48:47,910 --> 01:48:50,356
What the fuck is he doing?
I can't stop this.

1589
01:49:03,750 --> 01:49:04,831
Yes, please.

1590
01:49:08,470 --> 01:49:09,676
No!

1591
01:50:06,430 --> 01:50:08,512
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1592
01:50:08,670 --> 01:50:10,672
That is fucking spectacular!

1593
01:50:10,830 --> 01:50:13,595
Merlin, you're a fucking genius!

1594
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:16,913
What the fuck is happening out there?

1595
01:50:21,230 --> 01:50:22,516
Aren't you that princess
who went missing?

1596
01:50:22,670 --> 01:50:23,717
Can you get me out?

1597
01:50:24,350 --> 01:50:26,273
If I do, will you give me a kiss?

1598
01:50:26,430 --> 01:50:27,950
I've always wanted to kiss a princess.

1599
01:50:28,030 --> 01:50:30,590
If you get me out right now,
I'll give you more than just a kiss.

1600
01:50:32,270 --> 01:50:33,510
<i>You motherfucker.</i>

1601
01:50:33,710 --> 01:50:35,519
<i>Did you really think
I was stupid enough...</i>

1602
01:50:35,710 --> 01:50:37,872
<i>to implant one of those
things in my own head?</i>

1603
01:50:38,310 --> 01:50:39,880
<i>What are you, fucking crazy?</i>

1604
01:50:40,830 --> 01:50:43,117
All those innocent people killed
and for what?

1605
01:50:43,990 --> 01:50:46,834
You didn't stop shit!

1606
01:50:48,190 --> 01:50:50,192
Fine, I've locked the door.
What do you want me to do now?

1607
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:53,234
As I said, put your daughter
in the bathroom and throw away the key.

1608
01:50:53,990 --> 01:50:56,391
It's still happening!

1609
01:50:56,550 --> 01:50:57,711
You're fucking insane!

1610
01:50:57,870 --> 01:50:58,996
<i>Just do it.</i>

1611
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:27,675
Eggsy, the signal's started!

1612
01:51:27,830 --> 01:51:30,993
Get Valentine's hand off
that bloody desk now!

1613
01:51:31,150 --> 01:51:32,150
Sorry, love.

1614
01:51:32,510 --> 01:51:33,591
Got to save the world.

1615
01:51:34,870 --> 01:51:36,793
I'll be right back.

1616
01:51:38,230 --> 01:51:39,230
Good luck!

1617
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:46,990
London.

1618
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:16,430
Rio.

1619
01:52:32,430 --> 01:52:33,430
Get down!

1620
01:52:35,430 --> 01:52:36,430
You did it!

1621
01:52:45,870 --> 01:52:47,793
The glass is not gonna hold long.

1622
01:52:49,470 --> 01:52:51,074
You stay here.

1623
01:52:53,310 --> 01:52:54,471
Merlin, quickly, how do I get up there?

1624
01:52:54,790 --> 01:52:56,713
- Keep shooting, I'll find a route.
- Understood.

1625
01:53:13,270 --> 01:53:14,351
Holy fuck!

1626
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:34,156
We're back up.

1627
01:53:35,030 --> 01:53:36,361
We're back up!

1628
01:53:43,350 --> 01:53:45,079
This is great!

1629
01:53:53,190 --> 01:53:54,032
<i>Eggsy!</i>

1630
01:53:54,190 --> 01:53:55,715
Fucking get on with it!

1631
01:53:55,910 --> 01:53:57,116
Kick his ass, Gazy!

1632
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:06,560
Seoul, Caracas, Mumbai!

1633
01:54:14,910 --> 01:54:17,390
Kill that motherfucker!
He killed all our friends!

1634
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:36,752
Eggsy, the world is going to shit!

1635
01:54:46,150 --> 01:54:48,232
- Is he dead yet?
- Not yet!

1636
01:54:48,390 --> 01:54:50,518
Stop playing with your food!

1637
01:54:50,670 --> 01:54:51,671
Kill him!

1638
01:56:09,790 --> 01:56:11,155
Gazelle!

1639
01:56:12,990 --> 01:56:14,151
Gazelle!

1640
01:56:23,790 --> 01:56:25,519
Come on! Come on!

1641
01:56:28,510 --> 01:56:29,510
<i>Kill him!</i>

1642
01:56:46,830 --> 01:56:47,830
Hey!

1643
01:57:12,550 --> 01:57:14,075
<i>Well done, son!</i>

1644
01:57:15,390 --> 01:57:16,390
Yes!

1645
01:57:16,510 --> 01:57:17,671
Yes, Eggsy!

1646
01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:19,400
Well done, Eggsy!

1647
01:57:19,910 --> 01:57:21,071
And you, Lancelot.

1648
01:57:23,830 --> 01:57:26,401
I'm so sorry.
Mummy would never hurt you.

1649
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:30,079
Mummy would never hurt you.
I'm so sorry.

1650
01:57:32,550 --> 01:57:33,597
Are you okay?

1651
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:39,239
Harry would be proud of you, Eggsy.

1652
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:41,671
He was right.

1653
01:57:57,110 --> 01:57:58,396
What's up, man?

1654
01:57:58,750 --> 01:58:02,118
Is this the part where you say
some really bad pun?

1655
01:58:03,590 --> 01:58:05,592
Well, it's like you said to Harry.

1656
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:11,111
This ain't that kind of movie, bruv.

1657
01:58:12,590 --> 01:58:14,035
Perfect.

1658
01:58:34,910 --> 01:58:36,116
Eggsy, where are you going?

1659
01:58:36,270 --> 01:58:38,510
There's no need for champagne.
We got loads in the plane.

1660
01:58:45,630 --> 01:58:46,711
Did you save the world?

1661
01:58:47,310 --> 01:58:48,800
Yes, I did.

1662
01:58:50,110 --> 01:58:52,920
So, you gonna come in?

1663
01:58:53,670 --> 01:58:55,160
Yes, I am.

1664
01:59:00,630 --> 01:59:02,519
Merlin, the cell's locked.
How do I get in?

1665
01:59:04,790 --> 01:59:06,315
26-25.

1666
01:59:10,670 --> 01:59:13,276
Merlin, you're the guvnor.

1667
01:59:15,470 --> 01:59:17,837
<i>You owe me, Eggsy.</i>

1668
01:59:23,470 --> 01:59:24,517
Eggsy?

1669
01:59:30,510 --> 01:59:32,194
Oh, my word.

1670
02:00:19,390 --> 02:00:22,234
Michelle, turn that shit off.
It's doing my nut in.

1671
02:00:23,230 --> 02:00:24,755
I rather like that song.

1672
02:00:25,270 --> 02:00:26,874
Leave it on, eh, Mum?

1673
02:00:30,630 --> 02:00:32,553
Mugsy's back.

1674
02:00:32,670 --> 02:00:35,070
You've finally come
to have that word with me, have you, son?

1675
02:00:35,470 --> 02:00:36,830
Or are you gonna run away again...

1676
02:00:36,910 --> 02:00:38,514
and pretend you're going to court,
dressed like that?

1677
02:00:38,950 --> 02:00:40,361
Oh, you mean this?

1678
02:00:41,870 --> 02:00:43,201
No.

1679
02:00:43,790 --> 02:00:47,112
I know this bloke who's just taken over
a tailor shop on Savile Row.

1680
02:00:48,190 --> 02:00:49,760
He's given me a job, Mum.

1681
02:00:50,470 --> 02:00:51,756
It comes with a lot of perks.

1682
02:00:53,150 --> 02:00:54,481
Including a house.

1683
02:00:55,630 --> 02:00:57,473
Come and live with me there, Mum.

1684
02:00:58,070 --> 02:00:59,151
Come on.

1685
02:00:59,310 --> 02:01:00,310
Sit down, you.

1686
02:01:01,430 --> 02:01:03,670
Only place she'll be visiting
is you in fucking hospital.

1687
02:01:03,790 --> 02:01:05,599
- Do you hear?
- Just leave him alone, Dean!

1688
02:01:05,750 --> 02:01:07,991
Eggsy, just go. Please, just go, babe.

1689
02:01:09,470 --> 02:01:10,756
All right.

1690
02:01:10,910 --> 02:01:12,480
That's it, do as Mummy says.

1691
02:01:12,630 --> 02:01:15,474
Why don't you ask that tailor friend of yours,
and knock up a nice chicken costume.

1692
02:01:15,630 --> 02:01:16,995
It'll suit you, you mug.

1693
02:01:19,270 --> 02:01:22,035
As a good friend once said...

1694
02:01:23,350 --> 02:01:24,476
"Manners...

1695
02:01:26,390 --> 02:01:27,390
"maketh...

1696
02:01:29,950 --> 02:01:30,951
"man."

1697
02:01:31,790 --> 02:01:34,157
- Dean?
- Shut the fuck up.

1698
02:01:34,310 --> 02:01:36,756
Eggsy, I'm gonna shove your manners
up your fucking...

1699
02:01:42,710 --> 02:01:43,710
So...

1700
02:01:43,950 --> 02:01:47,955
are we gonna stand around here all day,
or are we gonna fight?
