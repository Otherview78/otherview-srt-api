1
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,936
- Come on, easy. Easy, girl.
- Easy.

2
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,230
- Easy.
- Good. That'll do it.

3
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,107
- Steady.
- Good girl.

4
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,233
Steady.

5
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,695
Good girl! Good girl!

6
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:54,198
This is a stubborn one, huh?

7
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,534
Easy. Attagirl.

8
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,202
There we go.

9
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,871
Who's a clever girl, then?

10
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:51,065
Come on, boy. Come here.

11
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:53,651
Come on, boy.

12
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,444
Come on.

13
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,631
Come on. Easy does it, easy does it.
Come on.

14
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:01,218
Steady there, boy. Steady, boy.
That's it. Nice and done now, isn't it?

15
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,223
Hey, hey!

16
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:19,737
Morning, Pop.

17
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,574
Put your mark here.

18
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,202
Good luck.

19
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,039
Get the colt.

20
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,422
Whoa, whoa.

21
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,151
Easy. Hey.

22
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,195
Now that's a beauty.

23
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:05,950
Forget it, Ted. He's half thoroughbred.
Not got a day's work in him.

24
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:07,993
Now there...

25
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:12,873
There's your ticket.

26
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:20,506
But look at him, Si.

27
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,175
Look at that creature.

28
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:28,597
Don't be daft. You need
something solid to plough a field.

29
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:32,726
Yeah, but he's something else, that one.

30
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,647
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
settle down, settle down.

31
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,148
Horses on my right,

32
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,651
men with money in their pockets
on my left.

33
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,028
It's the perfect combination.

34
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,532
- Is Fred Goddard here?
- Yes, I's here!

35
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:48,867
Good. More money than sense.

36
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,872
- Dave Hill!
- I'm here, yes!

37
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,333
Bugger off, you tight bastard.

38
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,085
You've been coming here for 20 years,

39
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,504
never bought so much
as a pork scratching!

40
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:17,896
Come on.

41
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,234
All right.
First up today, a gorgeous young horse.

42
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:26,572
Prettiest young thing I've seen
since my wife on our wedding day.

43
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:30,659
Let's get going, shall we?
Who wants this wonderful creature?

44
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:32,703
One guinea!

45
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,872
One guinea. One guinea.

46
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,041
I thought you needed a plough horse,
Mr Narracott.

47
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,461
One guinea.
Any advance on one guinea?

48
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,046
- Two guineas!
- Two guineas.

49
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:44,214
- Three.
- Three guineas.

50
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:47,051
Ted Narracott,
it's completely the wrong animal.

51
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:50,012
Si Easton, I'm not gonna let
that bastard see me off.

52
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,555
- Five guineas!
- Five guineas!

53
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:53,474
- Six!
- Oh, for the love of...

54
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,476
- Seven!
- Seven guineas.

55
00:07:56,894 --> 00:08:00,230
Greedy sod.
Thinks he can just buy anybody. Eight!

56
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,816
Stop it. He's your landlord.
You can't be picking fights with him.

57
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,860
- Ten guineas!
- Ten guineas.

58
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,738
You haven't got the money.
Let's go home, let's have a pint.

59
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:12,076
Eleven guineas, sir! From as good
a man as any in this town!

60
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,081
Do I hear 12 guineas? Twelve guineas.

61
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:21,168
That's top price for a working animal.
Ted, save it for the shire!

62
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:24,505
There are big days and
there are small days. Which will it be?

63
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,006
Do I hear any advance on 11 guineas?

64
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,259
Just let him go, Dad.
I don't care for him. He's too jumpy.

65
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,930
Shall we say 25?

66
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:36,725
- Twenty-five guineas.
- He's got you there. Nice try, Ted.

67
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,602
You were great, Mr. N.

68
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,104
- Gave him a run for his money.
- Going, going...

69
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,022
Thirty!

70
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:43,774
Thirty guineas!

71
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,776
Thirty guineas.

72
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:47,903
Thirty guineas.

73
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,614
Going,

74
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,117
going,

75
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,620
gone! To Mr Ted Narracott!

76
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,917
What have you done, Ted?
What have you done?

77
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,263
Here you are, Ted.

78
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:23,647
Quite a beast there. What are you
gonna do with him on a working farm?

79
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:28,068
I hope you got the rent, Ted.
I'll be around for it when it comes due.

80
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:30,988
You're a fool, Ted.
And now Rosie will never forgive you.

81
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,855
- What have you done?
- That's Mooney's colt.

82
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,523
You were supposed to buy
a plough horse!

83
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,442
You bought him?

84
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,444
What'd you pay for him?

85
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,697
How much, Ted Narracott?

86
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,451
I won't tell you a lie,
though I would love to.

87
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,536
Thirty guineas!

88
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,038
Thirty guineas?

89
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:25,876
He's not worth 10! Are you
out of your mind? What about the rent?

90
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:29,880
He's a strong one, Rosie.
Look at the way he holds his head.

91
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,050
How the hell are we gonna
pull anything with that?

92
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,719
Ted, you have to take him back.
You have to take him back right now.

93
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,138
You have to get down on your knees
and beg for our money back.

94
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:41,558
No. No, please, don't take him back.

95
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,646
We can't take him back
until he's broken in.

96
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,358
And how are you gonna train
a horse with that leg?

97
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,984
I'll train him.

98
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,904
You stay out of this, Albert.
You don't know nothing about horses.

99
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,990
Please, Mum. Please, let me. I can do it.

100
00:10:57,074 --> 00:11:00,827
We have to keep him. No choice.

101
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,830
Right. Well, you got one month
to break him in,

102
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:06,333
or I'm taking him back myself.

103
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:12,172
How'd you get to 30?
What other fool bid you up that high?

104
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,008
It was Lyons.

105
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,099
We're going to lose everything.

106
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:25,769
After all we've been through,
we're going to lose it all.

107
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,775
Don't worry, Mum. I'll raise him.
I'll raise him good.

108
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:35,195
Well, you better. Go on, get started!

109
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,242
See if a child can undo what your fool
of a father's done to this family of ours.

110
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:44,288
Easy, boy. Easy. Easy.

111
00:11:44,288 --> 00:12:14,288
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

112
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,159
Right.

113
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,412
Let's make a start then.

114
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:32,836
It's oats.

115
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:37,007
Very tasty, that is.
It's beef and gravy to us.

116
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,634
Come on.

117
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,166
I'll bet you're missing your mother.

118
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,210
Look at you.

119
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:18,382
First time without your mum.
First time away from home.

120
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,552
But you're not alone, are you?

121
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,389
In fact.

122
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,225
'Cause I'm here.

123
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,523
It's all right.

124
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,025
All right.

125
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:43,532
I'm going to call you Joey.
You understand?

126
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,743
Joey. That's you.

127
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,579
And I'm Albert.

128
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:53,250
It's all right. You're mine now.

129
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,044
You're mine.

130
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,963
Good boy. Good boy.

131
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,465
Good boy. Come on.

132
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,061
Whoa.

133
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:57,647
I want you to stay there, Joey.

134
00:14:58,648 --> 00:14:59,983
Stay.

135
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:01,902
That's it.

136
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,654
Good boy. That's it, you got it.

137
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:06,907
Hey, look at him, Albie!

138
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,493
He's playing Grandma's Footsteps!

139
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,831
All right. Come on, Joey. Back you go.
Come on.

140
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,584
Come on. Back you go. You're all right.

141
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:22,964
That's it. Good boy. All right.

142
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:26,510
You got to stay there. You understand?

143
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:32,182
That's it. Good boy. Good boy.

144
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,353
You've got it. Good boy.

145
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,356
Good boy.

146
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,358
Good.

147
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,361
Now call him. Whistle.

148
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,365
Come now, Joey.

149
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:50,700
Come on.

150
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,543
You can come now, Joey.

151
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:08,385
- I don't think he fancies your owls.
- I read it in a story.

152
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:12,556
It's how the Indians
used to summon their horses.

153
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:18,728
Now, Joey, when I whistle,
you've got to come. Understand?

154
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:25,569
My dad had a dog
who stayed when you called him.

155
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:28,196
He used to run up behind you
when you weren't looking, and...

156
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,365
He's not a dog.

157
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:33,493
He's just puzzling it through.

158
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:56,057
Will you look at you!

159
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,110
Albie!

160
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,611
There's only 15 here.

161
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,155
The rest will come.

162
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,992
You know by rights I could
take this farm back today, don't you?

163
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,620
And I'm a great believer in my rights.

164
00:17:58,703 --> 00:17:59,829
It will come.

165
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,834
If you drank less beer
and bought fewer horses,

166
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:08,672
you might be able to
look your landlord in the eye, Narracott.

167
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:12,926
I said I'll pay you.
We're going to plant the bottom field.

168
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,012
The bottom field's rock hard.
Only stones down there.

169
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,640
No. We're going to plough it.

170
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:24,646
Just give me till the autumn. I'll pay
every penny I owe you, with interest.

171
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:29,025
How are you going to plough it?
Not with that fancy animal of yours.

172
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:31,695
He'll do it.

173
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,447
You'll not get that one in a harness,
let alone pulling a plough,

174
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,491
even drunk on a Tuesday night.
You know that.

175
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:40,203
And I can't wait for the money,
there's a war coming.

176
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:47,001
I promise you that field will be ploughed.

177
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,838
We'll plant it with turnips.

178
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,341
The money will be yours
when harvest comes.

179
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,013
Please, sir. Please.

180
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,108
Very well.

181
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,695
If that fancy ploughs that field,

182
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,990
I'll give you till October
to set things straight.

183
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,455
What if he doesn't?

184
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,459
I'll take the horse on the day he fails.

185
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:31,379
And I'll take your father's farm,
and give it to working men who can

186
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:34,424
hold their pints and hold their heads
high in decent company.

187
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,260
No, please. Sir, you can't do that.

188
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,973
Now, now, lad. What?
Are you bladdered as well?

189
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:48,146
Ted Narracott,
I've got you down in my book.

190
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:35,360
- You can't harness him.
- He's got to be collared.

191
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,321
You're scaring him, Dad!
You're scaring him.

192
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,865
- He can't take a plough!
- He's got to plough!

193
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,284
He won't be able to do it!

194
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,286
He's too young.
He's not even been backed yet!

195
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,122
Ted!

196
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:57,382
It's all right, boy. It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

197
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:00,802
I knew this would happen
as soon as I laid eyes on him.

198
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,220
Ted, no.

199
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,057
Ted, no!

200
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,350
He's worth nothing to me.

201
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:11,062
If he won't take the collar,
he's not worth a damn thing!

202
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,398
- Dad?
- Move aside.

203
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:15,775
Dad, stop!

204
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,823
You shoot that horse, we have nothing.

205
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,074
No!

206
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:32,750
You were right what you said, Dad.
He'll do it.

207
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,588
You told Lyons he'll plough that field,
and he will.

208
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:37,964
You'll see.

209
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,258
He'll show you.

210
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,635
We'll show you.

211
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,597
We'll get it done.

212
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,769
Let go.

213
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:54,147
Let go.

214
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,860
Go back to the house.

215
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:10,496
Some days are best forgotten.
Today ain't one of them. Come on.

216
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,814
How are you today, Joey?

217
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,780
I don't know much about life, boy,

218
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:48,201
but I do know that there are big days
and there are small days.

219
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:53,164
Most days are small days, and, well,
they don't matter much to anyone.

220
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,541
But this...

221
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,837
Well, this is a big one.

222
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,256
This is our big day!

223
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,345
It's cold out there,
so I'm going to take this off.

224
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,182
If it's tough for you,
it should be tough for me, too.

225
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:17,730
Now, I'm going to teach you
how to plough.

226
00:23:18,982 --> 00:23:22,151
And you're going to learn.
Is that understood?

227
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:27,615
Then we can be together, which is
how I believe things are meant to be.

228
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,704
Steady, boy.

229
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:37,000
Here we go. Here we go. Come on.

230
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,711
Come on. Come on.

231
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:45,717
Now, boy. Easy. Easy.

232
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,261
Look at me, Joey.

233
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,388
See?

234
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,558
See?

235
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:57,645
You just got to put your nose through.

236
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:01,232
That's it.

237
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:07,238
See, you've got it. You've got it.

238
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,742
Good boy.

239
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:12,869
There.

240
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:44,400
Too large, too rocky,
matted with grass roots.

241
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:46,986
Even a sturdy plough horse
would never manage it alone.

242
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,863
Yet he will, I say.

243
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:52,450
You'd swear he'd sprout wings and fly
if Albert told you so.

244
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:56,287
It's a fine thing, loyal to your mate,
even if he is a bit barmy.

245
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,956
A team of two might manage,
given a month and good weather.

246
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,100
Ted too squeamish to watch, is he?

247
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:20,228
Of course he's watching.

248
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:33,366
Come on.

249
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,119
Come on.

250
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,801
Well, you've raised him up
a true Narracott, Ted.

251
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:54,303
Picture of his father, he is.

252
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:58,724
Not a dollop of ordinary sense,
but that thick stubbornness

253
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:02,145
that'll lead him to insist
on the impossible.

254
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:13,156
Wasn't a farmer in Devon
didn't admire you, myself among them,

255
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,074
leaving your brothers that fine farm

256
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:19,078
and setting yourself at this stony patch
of unpromising ground.

257
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:22,999
You've fettle enough for 20 men.

258
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:28,087
But with a gimpy leg and the drinking...

259
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:30,840
For the pain, isn't it, that you drink?

260
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:37,013
None of us could have anticipated
an ending better than this.

261
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,017
Makes me question
the wisdom of the charity

262
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,935
that urged me to rent you this place,

263
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:46,606
not only looking at you, me old pal,
but that pretty little wife of yours.

264
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:49,108
Thought you were a spark, she did!

265
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:54,030
And now your son's sinking into
the selfsame bog that's swallowing you.

266
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,121
See, Joey?

267
00:27:02,205 --> 00:27:04,332
I got the collar, too!

268
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,544
Okay, come on, boy.

269
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,880
Walk on. That's it.

270
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:14,050
Walk on!

271
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,053
Walk on, Joey.

272
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,473
Come on, boy, walk on!

273
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:25,019
You'd be better off standing at the top
of the hill and going down!

274
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:29,148
Gravity's the only friend
you're gonna have today, young lad!

275
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,652
Walk on, Joey! Walk on!

276
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:34,862
Come on, Joey, walk on.

277
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,240
Walk on, boy.

278
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:40,034
Walk on. Come on, walk on.

279
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:45,498
It'll take the whip to move him.

280
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:17,029
Bravo! You reached the top of the hill!
Off you go again, boy!

281
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:19,949
You'll make even better time
coming down!

282
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:24,513
That's the way. Now, come on,
keep straight, boy. Good boy.

283
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:28,517
Keep straight. Good lad. Good lad.
Now walk on. Good boy.

284
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:31,187
Good boy. Now come on, dig in!

285
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,191
Albie, we're all with you!

286
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:38,444
Come on, keep it straight, boy.

287
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,030
That's it, walk on. Walk on.

288
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,074
Look, look, the plough hasn't
even cut yet.

289
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:53,209
Do you know,
I believe we can do it, Joey.

290
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,337
I knew when I first saw you
that you'd be the best of us.

291
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:59,048
That's why he bought you.

292
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:02,134
He knows you have all the courage
he never had.

293
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:05,471
I knew when I first saw you
that you'd be the one who'd save us!

294
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:14,855
Whoa.

295
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,026
You've got no chance, lad.

296
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:22,405
He'll not turn over half an acre.
Give it up now.

297
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:27,410
You've done well. You've tried hard.
You're more of a man than your father.

298
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,580
Come on now, Mr Lyons,
that's a bit rough, isn't it?

299
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,999
Well, he'll destroy that horse.

300
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:43,384
I'll be over Thursday.

301
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,595
Give you a day to close it up.

302
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:55,229
Your wool.

303
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:57,940
I'm sorry, Rosie.

304
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,127
Now, boy!

305
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,296
You've got to do it, Joey!

306
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:23,132
You don't know, so I'm going to
have to do the knowing for you.

307
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,801
The rest of our lives depend on this!

308
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:30,222
So get set to pull! And pull straight!
And pull hard!

309
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,227
Now, boy! Go!

310
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:38,439
Walk on, Joey, walk on! Whoa! That's it!

311
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:41,650
Good boy, Joey! Good boy!

312
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:53,329
Walk on! Walk on! Walk on!
Walk on, Joey!

313
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:57,833
Go on, walk on! That's it.
Walk on. Walk on.

314
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:11,472
Go around it!

315
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,265
Whoa, Joey!

316
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:15,684
Whoa, Joey! Joey!

317
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:18,270
Joey! Whoa! Whoa!

318
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:20,356
Joey, stop, you'll break the blade!

319
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:28,864
Will you look at you!

320
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:33,035
Mum, Dad! Come and look!

321
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,453
He's doing it!

322
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,055
Good lad, Albie!

323
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:57,351
Albert, well done!

324
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,896
I wouldn't have believed it!

325
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:04,400
I'd not let a child of mine slip in the mud
alongside a plough blade.

326
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:05,734
He could lose a foot.

327
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:07,570
You'll likelier lose an eye, Mr Lyons,

328
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:10,656
if you carry on prating at me
how to manage my son!

329
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:14,910
Or my plough, or my horse, or my field,
or my farm!

330
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:25,254
Come on, Albie! Push on through!

331
00:33:57,578 --> 00:34:01,540
Get it done, Albie! Get it done.

332
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:24,146
Albie, are you all right?

333
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,564
Are you all right?

334
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,402
Up you get.

335
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:33,572
My pair of fools. My mighty fools.

336
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:58,430
You're as battered
and bloodied as he is.

337
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,268
- Where's Dad?
- Still in the bottom field.

338
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:04,687
Stumbling about, I suppose.

339
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:06,772
It's not the drink, Albert,
that makes him stumble.

340
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:07,940
He drinks, Mum!

341
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:11,527
So might you if you'd been
where he's been, seen what he's seen.

342
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,028
He don't talk to me about it.

343
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:17,366
He don't talk about it 'cause he can't.
There aren't words for some things.

344
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,618
Come here.

345
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,299
The mice have been at it.

346
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:36,176
Sit down.

347
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:43,642
Here.

348
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:46,729
It's his campaign pennant.

349
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:50,482
He were Sergeant, 7th Battalion,
imperial Yeomanry.

350
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:55,571
And that is
the Queen's South Africa Medal.

351
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:59,074
Every man who fought in the Boer War
got one of those.

352
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,743
And this...

353
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:04,246
That's the
Distinguished Conduct Medal.

354
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,499
- Not Dad's?
- Well, it isn't mine, dear.

355
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:11,253
He got that
after the fighting at Transvaal.

356
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,756
After he'd been hurt
and he'd saved some other lads,

357
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,007
and, well, I don't know what else.

358
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,092
He won't tell me, either.

359
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:19,428
But the first day he got home,
he just tossed them out.

360
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,597
First day he could walk,
he threw them straight in the dustbin

361
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,433
and wouldn't hear a word I said not to.

362
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:30,272
See, what you done today,
you and Joey, you're chuffed up now,

363
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,609
and so you should be, my splendid boy.

364
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,612
It's good to be proud
when you've done something good.

365
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:40,949
But what he done in Africa,
whatever it was, he takes no pride in it.

366
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:44,870
Hard as it surely was
and however much pain it's cost him,

367
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,040
he refuses to be proud of killing,
I suppose.

368
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,210
I'd be proud.

369
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,296
If I'd gone off to war,
if I'd gone and saved my mates...

370
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,548
Whether or not you think
you'd do the same thing as him,

371
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:59,718
think how brave he is
for refusing to be proud.

372
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:05,057
Your dad makes mistakes,

373
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,976
and he drinks to forget
the mistakes that he's made,

374
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:11,396
but he never gave up.

375
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,649
And he does that for us.

376
00:37:14,817 --> 00:37:18,570
And today, you showed the world
it's all been worth it.

377
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:23,575
You keep looking after Joey,
and he'll always be looking after you.

378
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:31,083
"Sergeant, 7th Battalion,
imperial Yeomanry."

379
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,254
You see this, Joey?

380
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:38,465
It's been through an entire war.

381
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,013
I'm not stealing it.

382
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,017
I'll give it back to him someday.

383
00:38:31,143 --> 00:38:32,185
Um...

384
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:35,397
I'm the only boy that drives in
the village. No one else drives but me.

385
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:37,733
That's right, and this is my dad's car.

386
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:39,234
- You're lucky that you're in it.
- Your dad's car.

387
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,030
I'm not normally allowed to drive it
'cause it's so...

388
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:47,409
Is he a friend of yours?

389
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:07,346
Come on, boy.
Let's show her how to fly!

390
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,274
- Ahhh!
- Oh!

391
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:38,043
Well, you're clearly not going to be
a jumper.

392
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:05,487
Shoo, Harold!

393
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:18,500
We can try planting something else.

394
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:22,004
Or we could hire ourselves out
to Uncle Bob.

395
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:29,636
How else are
we gonna pay Mr Lyons' rent?

396
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:46,611
What are we going to do?

397
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:54,661
I used to believe that God

398
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,373
gave each man
his fair portion of bad luck.

399
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:03,920
I don't feel that any more.
I've had more than my share.

400
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:10,552
You'll stop loving me, Rose,
and I won't blame you when you do.

401
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,098
Well, I might hate you more,

402
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,351
but I'll never love you less.

403
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,616
It's war!

404
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:35,911
We are at war with Germany!

405
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:41,041
You hear?
England is at war with Germany!

406
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:47,297
They're going to ring the bells at 6:00,

407
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:52,302
and then never ring them again
until the war is over.

408
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:03,814
Look smart, Joey lad!
It's the Tavistock Fair!

409
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,788
What has he done with him?

410
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:37,681
First name, middle name, last. Sign.

411
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:41,184
Last name first.
First name, middle name, last.

412
00:42:41,852 --> 00:42:45,021
Take my word for it,
finest horse in the parish.

413
00:42:45,147 --> 00:42:48,358
Goes like a racer,
strong, decent, very fine.

414
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:53,613
No curbs, no splints. Good feet
and teeth. He's as sound as a bell, sir.

415
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,949
And how much are you charging, sir,

416
00:42:56,032 --> 00:43:00,036
for this strong, decent,
and very fine animal?

417
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:01,705
Forty.

418
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,625
I'll give you 20 and not a penny more.

419
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:09,713
Twenty's no good to me, Captain.
Thirty-five and he's yours.

420
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:12,132
I don't even know how he rides.

421
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:15,051
Oh, he rides. Splendidly.

422
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:18,054
You'll be astonished, I promise you that.

423
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:21,016
Finest horse in all of Devon.

424
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:24,227
Finest horse I've ever seen.

425
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:32,194
Thank you.

426
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:42,078
You can't.

427
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:45,415
You can't. He's mine.

428
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,167
- I trained him.
- Albert.

429
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,002
You can't have him. He's my horse, sir.

430
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:52,047
I'm afraid it's too late, lad.
I've just paid 30 guineas for him.

431
00:43:52,756 --> 00:43:55,258
Please. I'll get you money.

432
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,263
I will, I'll get you money. I'll work for it.

433
00:44:00,931 --> 00:44:02,265
I'll work for it.

434
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:08,939
He won't obey anyone else.

435
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:12,943
He won't be any good in the war neither.
He shies at every sound.

436
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:15,779
I'm sorry.

437
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:19,950
Well, if Joey's going, I'm going, too.
I'm volunteering.

438
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:23,119
- I see. What's your name, lad?
- Albert, sir.

439
00:44:23,245 --> 00:44:24,913
- And how old are you, Albert?
- Nineteen, sir.

440
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:29,251
- Is that the truth?
- No, sir, but I look 19

441
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:30,418
and I'm bigger than most 19-year-olds,

442
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:32,712
and I'm strong, sir,
and I'm not afraid of anything.

443
00:44:32,796 --> 00:44:35,090
I don't doubt your qualifications, Albert,

444
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:38,885
but the law is very clear
about the proper age for soldiering.

445
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:42,264
Your father's done what he had to do,
you know that.

446
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:46,393
Thirty guineas isn't nearly enough
to purchase a horse

447
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:49,312
as fine as your Joey, I know that.

448
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:51,106
But it's all I've got.

449
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:56,319
Will you lease him to me, Albert?
To be my own mount?

450
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:03,076
I promise you, man to man,
that I'll look after him

451
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,578
as closely as you've done.

452
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:09,833
I'll respect him and all the care
that you've taken with him.

453
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:15,171
And if I can, I'll return him to your care.

454
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:22,679
Now say goodbye.

455
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:27,642
It's all right.

456
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:31,730
All right, turn it in. That's enough.
He's a horse, not a dog.

457
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:34,107
Now on your way. Come on!

458
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:44,034
Do you want to lose the farm? Rose?

459
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,038
It's the way you did it.

460
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:52,208
But we're at war.

461
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:56,212
Aren't we just?

462
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:33,416
Joey.

463
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,085
I told you, sling your hook!

464
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,212
Let him be, Perkins.

465
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:42,092
This isn't the end.
This isn't the end, my brother.

466
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:45,553
I, Albert Narracott, solemnly swear
we will be together again.

467
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:49,891
Wherever you are, I will find you,
and I will bring you home.

468
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:10,620
Steady, steady. Steady now, come on!

469
00:47:11,413 --> 00:47:15,250
Walk on! Walk on, come on! Get on!

470
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:32,809
- Take good care of him.
- Yes, sir. I will.

471
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:58,501
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Easy. Easy.

472
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:02,672
Easy.

473
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:12,974
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

474
00:48:14,184 --> 00:48:17,479
Steady, steady. Whoa, whoa, Joey!

475
00:48:17,604 --> 00:48:21,274
Stop mucking about, you hear?
You're in the army now, son.

476
00:48:22,025 --> 00:48:25,028
Good boy. Good boy. Steady.

477
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:28,698
Steady, steady. Come on.
Easy, come on.

478
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:31,201
Come on, around. Good boy.

479
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:33,870
Relax.

480
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:36,998
Easy, easy, back up!

481
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,461
Joey, meet Topthorn.

482
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:43,546
Topthorn, this is Joey.

483
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:46,382
Sort out who's in charge
between the two of you. Do you hear?

484
00:48:46,508 --> 00:48:50,011
If you want to fight, get it over with
'cause once we're over there,

485
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:52,555
you're going to need
everything you've got for Fritz.

486
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,559
Gently, Perkins.
I don't want to sour him.

487
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:59,020
There'll be nothing gentle
about the war, sir.

488
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:01,231
And there'll be nothing gentle
about this one, either.

489
00:49:01,356 --> 00:49:04,359
I understand that, Sergeant,
but I want him fit and shining.

490
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:06,319
He's my horse.

491
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:07,529
Sir.

492
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:10,406
Easy, boy.

493
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:14,160
Scares the living daylights out of me.

494
00:49:14,244 --> 00:49:17,914
- Who?
- Perkins. Glad he's on our side.

495
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:20,708
Not bad. Not bad at all.

496
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:24,921
Still, not a patch on my Topthorn.

497
00:49:25,547 --> 00:49:28,716
I wouldn't be so sure.
I think he's got potential.

498
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:31,678
He's certainly got the bit
between his teeth.

499
00:49:31,761 --> 00:49:34,722
I actually think my Blenheim's faster
than the pair of them.

500
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:36,766
Clear off.

501
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:42,272
All right, gentlemen, listen here.

502
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:46,025
Everything tells us the same story,
from Waterloo to Omdurman,

503
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:48,695
from Pickett's Charge
to the Battle of Mars-la-Tour.

504
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:51,990
The first attack can and should be
the decisive one. Perkins?

505
00:49:52,073 --> 00:49:53,783
- Yes, sir.
- No excuses, no mistakes.

506
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:56,035
Every horse groomed
and fit for presentation.

507
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:58,621
- I want a full practise charge tomorrow.
- Sir.

508
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:09,757
I thought you two had bottled out.

509
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:11,217
As if.

510
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:17,849
All right, then. Let's see what
you two jokers are made of, shall we?

511
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:19,851
This is what quiet confidence looks like.

512
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:21,477
I'll wait for you two at the Duke of York.

513
00:50:24,272 --> 00:50:25,940
Over to you, Captain Nicholls.

514
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:32,280
Draw swords!

515
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:36,618
Give point!

516
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:40,663
Charge!

517
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:03,603
Come on, Joey, I know you've got it.
Come on, boy!

518
00:51:18,618 --> 00:51:19,786
Come on, boy!

519
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:33,341
Whoa! Whoa!

520
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:39,847
Nice of you to turn up.

521
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:43,351
He's got speed, I'll give him that.
But has he got stamina?

522
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:45,144
He has everything.

523
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:04,664
What are you up to?

524
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,666
I'm writing a letter.

525
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,001
With a picture in it?

526
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:13,381
It's to the boy who owned Joey.

527
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:16,217
I want to show him
how wonderful he's looking.

528
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:19,846
Before we take him across the Channel
to face a million German guns.

529
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:21,222
Yes, before that.

530
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:24,142
4:00 a.m. start tomorrow,

531
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:27,645
travelling with the Dragoon Guards
and the Royals. Transport detachment.

532
00:52:27,729 --> 00:52:29,731
They need to be at the dock
at 5:00 a.m. to check all the kit.

533
00:52:29,856 --> 00:52:32,066
Battle orders, no polishing.

534
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:36,404
Buttons, helmet buckles, stirrup irons,
let them all go dull.

535
00:52:36,529 --> 00:52:38,322
I don't want anything to flash in the sun
and give us away.

536
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:39,741
Of course.

537
00:52:40,867 --> 00:52:42,535
- Charlie.
- Jamie.

538
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:44,662
Charlie.

539
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:51,586
What do you think of the new cap?

540
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:56,924
Silk lining. I quite like it.

541
00:52:57,383 --> 00:53:00,011
I'm not sure it's going to make
a lot of difference to the Germans.

542
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:02,764
Oh, I don't know about that.
Think about it.

543
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:06,350
You're a Boche, just working out
which of two chaps to shoot,

544
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:08,186
and you thought, "Good Lord,

545
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:11,105
"one of them really is wearing
a very stylish cap indeed!"

546
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,607
You might shoot the other one instead.

547
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:18,571
Or alternatively think, "I fancy that cap,"
and kill you first of all.

548
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:23,576
Hadn't thought of that.

549
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:55,191
That is our target,
the German 11th Division,

550
00:53:55,316 --> 00:53:58,236
at the moment bivouacked three miles
to the east of the Menin Road.

551
00:53:58,319 --> 00:53:59,445
We have been watching them,

552
00:53:59,529 --> 00:54:02,031
and they have pitched tents
for the night and lit cooking fires.

553
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:05,117
Knock them out and we could slide in
behind the German lines

554
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:06,994
and come at them from the south
at Geluveld.

555
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,162
Excellent.

556
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:10,748
- Numbers?
- About 600, infantry.

557
00:54:10,832 --> 00:54:11,916
Twice our size.

558
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:13,918
Regiments of horse and men,
the advantage is ours.

559
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,712
And we have surprise on our side.
But the sooner we move, the better.

560
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:18,881
We have no assurance
they'll still be there tomorrow morning.

561
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:21,300
Right. Good.

562
00:54:21,384 --> 00:54:23,594
So today it is. Charlie, tell the men.

563
00:54:23,678 --> 00:54:25,638
- Salisbury formation?
- Salisbury formation.

564
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:27,598
Charge through them
and secure the ground behind.

565
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:30,351
The grass to the left is taller
than we are, it's perfect cover.

566
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:31,727
Excellent work, Sergeant Major.

567
00:54:31,853 --> 00:54:34,355
Time spent
on reconnaissance is rarely wasted.

568
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,815
Thank you, Singh.

569
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:37,817
Jamie!

570
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,863
They have no idea we're coming.

571
00:54:41,988 --> 00:54:44,156
Not having scruples, are you, Jim?

572
00:54:44,824 --> 00:54:47,994
No, I understand
the surprise is everything.

573
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:51,831
But if it must be done, let's do it quickly.

574
00:54:58,087 --> 00:54:59,422
You all right, Charlie?

575
00:55:02,008 --> 00:55:03,342
Never been better.

576
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:06,679
Literally. Never better.

577
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:12,685
Prepare to mount! Mount!

578
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,188
Prepare to mount!

579
00:55:16,856 --> 00:55:18,065
Mount!

580
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:19,692
Thank you, Stanley.

581
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:24,906
Hey, Joey.

582
00:55:26,032 --> 00:55:27,533
My bonny boy.

583
00:55:33,748 --> 00:55:35,750
You're all right, aren't you, Joey?

584
00:55:37,585 --> 00:55:38,586
Eh?

585
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:07,573
Gentlemen, it is an honour
to ride beside you.

586
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:12,578
Make the Kaiser rue the day
he dared to cross swords with us.

587
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:17,917
Let every man make himself,
his King, his country,

588
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,753
and his fallen comrades proud.

589
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:23,422
Be brave.

590
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:27,093
Fear God! Honour the King!

591
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:29,929
Fear God! Honour the King!

592
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:47,947
Draw swords!

593
00:56:50,116 --> 00:56:52,159
Good luck, my friends.

594
00:56:58,457 --> 00:56:59,959
Forward, to walk!

595
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,629
Walk, march!

596
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:14,306
Forward, to canter!

597
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:19,979
Canter, march!

598
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:49,258
<i>Kavallerie!</i>

599
00:57:57,683 --> 00:57:59,351
Charge!

600
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:41,435
Burn the documents!

601
01:00:13,652 --> 01:00:15,613
Pull him down!

602
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:41,680
What? Did you think that a garrison
on open ground would go undefended?

603
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,183
Look at yourself!

604
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:47,519
Who do you think you are?

605
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:50,791
Now come!

606
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:09,852
- What do we do with the horses?
- If they're injured, shoot them.

607
01:02:09,977 --> 01:02:11,061
And the others, sir?

608
01:02:11,145 --> 01:02:13,647
The others you round up and take
to base camp. They will pull guns.

609
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:16,400
You'll never get fancy horses like these
to pull guns.

610
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:17,985
- Then shoot them also!
- Sir?

611
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,279
Perhaps we could use some of them
with the ambulances,

612
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:22,990
to get the injured men off the field.

613
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:27,119
- Will they take the harness?
- I'd like to try, sir.

614
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:34,043
It won't work. They're cavalry.

615
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:35,753
- Let's try.
- You won't get the harness on.

616
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:38,839
Come on, Michael. Whoa. Whoa.

617
01:02:39,214 --> 01:02:42,801
Easy now.
Easy now, Englishman. Easy.

618
01:02:42,885 --> 01:02:45,012
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

619
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,349
Easy. Easy. Easy.

620
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:49,725
Easy now.

621
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:50,893
Whoa.

622
01:02:51,018 --> 01:02:52,061
Gunther.

623
01:02:53,187 --> 01:02:55,522
It's hopeless. We can't help them.

624
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:22,841
Well, well, look at you.

625
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:27,513
Whoever taught you this
has just saved your life.

626
01:04:08,971 --> 01:04:10,639
Hello, the farm!

627
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:12,808
Hello, Si Easton.

628
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,477
I was at the post office.

629
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:20,774
And while I was there, Mrs Allen said
a parcel had come for Albert from the...

630
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:23,402
From the...

631
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:25,571
From over there. And I thought

632
01:04:25,654 --> 01:04:29,158
I could go up that way in the morning,
and here it is.

633
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:33,078
Who'd be sending me a parcel
over there?

634
01:04:33,162 --> 01:04:34,997
Well, open it and see.

635
01:04:46,842 --> 01:04:48,510
It's a sketchbook.

636
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:53,307
It's Captain Nicholls' sketchbook!

637
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:55,934
See that? That's a picture of Joey!

638
01:04:56,018 --> 01:04:57,853
It's a picture of Joey.

639
01:04:58,479 --> 01:04:59,938
Well, I never!

640
01:05:00,022 --> 01:05:01,482
And there's a letter.

641
01:05:02,191 --> 01:05:03,859
Well, go on then, go on.

642
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:08,322
"Dear Albert Narracott,
Captain Nicholls, who died...

643
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:11,867
"Captain Nicholls, who died in action
today, left you this.

644
01:05:11,992 --> 01:05:13,660
"Yours, Sergeant Sam Perkins."

645
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:16,622
You weren't to know it was bad news.

646
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:18,707
He was riding Joey when he died.

647
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:22,836
- You don't know that he was riding him.
- "In action," it says.

648
01:06:16,348 --> 01:06:17,683
Gentlemen!

649
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:23,063
We move forward
to the front line tonight.

650
01:06:24,106 --> 01:06:26,608
Full marching orders.

651
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:29,236
Get moving!

652
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:31,530
Schroeder!

653
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:34,408
No, not you. You. Come.

654
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:37,119
I'm keeping you here.

655
01:06:37,244 --> 01:06:39,955
You're best with the horses,
and we need to move the camp quickly

656
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,708
if the enemy continues
to push through from the west.

657
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:45,168
- They're pushing through?
- I'm told.

658
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:48,088
We will move later, when we find
where the horses are needed most.

659
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:50,966
Yes, sir. Perhaps I can keep
my brother here with me.

660
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:52,843
He's also very good with horses.

661
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,679
No. Not necessary.
Get moving, we leave tonight.

662
01:07:04,146 --> 01:07:05,814
It's all right, Gunther.

663
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:12,738
You are not going.

664
01:07:12,821 --> 01:07:16,450
I'll tell them you're only 14.
That you're a boy.

665
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:19,870
Father signed me in. He knew my age.
And so do they.

666
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:26,293
Mother obviously never told you
how to fold a shirt.

667
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:28,462
Of course she did. I just wasn't listening.

668
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:31,298
But you need to listen now.
I promised her.

669
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:35,927
I made her a solemn promise
that you would be safe with me.

670
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:37,679
With me, Michael.

671
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:43,977
They'll never make a head count.

672
01:07:44,061 --> 01:07:47,230
There are too many of us.
You can stay here.

673
01:07:47,314 --> 01:07:49,733
Slip underneath the bed,
until they move out.

674
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:51,151
Then what?

675
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:55,864
Gunther, it will be fine.

676
01:07:56,531 --> 01:08:00,661
And when all the machines break down
and they call up the horses,

677
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:03,705
I'll see you at the front.

678
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:06,917
We'll be together again.

679
01:08:09,169 --> 01:08:10,545
Gunther.

680
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:29,022
I'm giving this to you.
For luck.

681
01:08:37,531 --> 01:08:39,366
To keep you safe.

682
01:09:47,309 --> 01:09:48,602
Ah!

683
01:09:57,486 --> 01:09:59,821
Get back in line!

684
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:34,439
I'm hungry. Did you bring food?

685
01:10:34,523 --> 01:10:35,857
I'm sorry.

686
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:44,658
- Will Father be ashamed?
- He will pretend to be.

687
01:10:45,534 --> 01:10:47,536
Maybe at first he will be.

688
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:52,082
But in the end, he will be glad.

689
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:54,876
And us?

690
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:57,712
What about us?

691
01:11:06,054 --> 01:11:08,056
I was ready to go.

692
01:11:10,892 --> 01:11:12,894
I was proud to go.

693
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,607
I wanted to go.

694
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:29,953
The food in Italy is good.

695
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:31,371
Yes.

696
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:34,708
And what about the women?

697
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:38,962
Not as good as the food.

698
01:11:39,379 --> 01:11:43,383
Because they've eaten
too much of the food?

699
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:48,847
You are too young for war
and you're too young for women!

700
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,599
I don't feel so young.

701
01:11:53,435 --> 01:11:54,644
- Not any more.
- Michael.

702
01:11:54,728 --> 01:11:56,813
- What?
- Go to sleep.

703
01:11:57,898 --> 01:12:00,400
We have a big night of riding ahead.

704
01:12:02,611 --> 01:12:04,112
Good night, Michael.

705
01:12:10,118 --> 01:12:11,995
Night-night, Gunther.

706
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:13,515
- Schroeder.
- Yes, sir.

707
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:16,309
A mistake?

708
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,481
A promise.

709
01:13:22,816 --> 01:13:24,234
<i>Ja.</i>

710
01:15:02,082 --> 01:15:03,208
<i>Grand-père..</i>

711
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:10,673
It's closer today.

712
01:15:10,757 --> 01:15:14,427
The wind plays tricks with the noise.
It's moving away from us.

713
01:15:14,761 --> 01:15:16,763
I can hear it, <i>grand-Grand-père..</i>

714
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:18,765
And there is no wind.

715
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:21,351
You shouldn't lie to me.

716
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:23,812
Here. There is no wind here.

717
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:28,942
But over there, the wind is so strong
it will lift you off the ground.

718
01:15:30,318 --> 01:15:33,321
You lie about everything!

719
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:37,742
You say you aren't worried,
but it's clear you are.

720
01:15:38,326 --> 01:15:40,370
I know the war is approaching,

721
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:44,040
but you say,
"Oh, it's just a trick of the wind."

722
01:15:44,124 --> 01:15:45,583
Did I say that?

723
01:15:45,834 --> 01:15:48,503
You started lying
when Mama and Papa went away.

724
01:15:51,339 --> 01:15:52,674
They're dead.

725
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:54,843
But you won't say so.

726
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,428
Do you think I'll die
if you tell me the truth?

727
01:15:57,512 --> 01:15:59,180
The truth is

728
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:04,144
you should speak to your elders
with respect.

729
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:14,612
If you tell me the truth about the war,

730
01:16:15,029 --> 01:16:19,033
I will tell you the truth
about the big horses

731
01:16:19,659 --> 01:16:21,828
I've been keeping in the windmill.

732
01:16:22,829 --> 01:16:26,499
Now who is the one telling lies?

733
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:29,127
In the windmill?

734
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:33,381
Yes. They were standing in the windmill
waiting for Don Quixote.

735
01:16:34,382 --> 01:16:37,051
This is François and this is Claude.

736
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:40,638
I named them after two boys
who broke my heart last summer.

737
01:16:40,722 --> 01:16:42,682
They must belong to someone.

738
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:45,643
Horses like this don't just appear
from a fairy tale.

739
01:16:45,727 --> 01:16:48,980
Yes, I know, <i>grand-Grand-père..</i>
They are not unicorns.

740
01:16:49,063 --> 01:16:52,984
- Now, Emilie...
- So I will be fair and wait one day,

741
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:55,778
and if no one comes to get them
by night-time,

742
01:16:55,862 --> 01:16:58,448
then they belong to me.

743
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:00,700
Emilie, look at me.

744
01:17:03,036 --> 01:17:04,204
You cannot ride.

745
01:17:04,329 --> 01:17:06,789
Mother used to tell me
how my bones would give way

746
01:17:06,873 --> 01:17:11,502
- with the slightest bump or fall.
- Yes. That's right. So, it is settled?

747
01:17:13,755 --> 01:17:15,006
Good girl.

748
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:20,678
It will only be settled
when I decide which one to ride first.

749
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:25,183
Over my dead body!

750
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:27,268
At least I won't have long to wait!

751
01:17:47,789 --> 01:17:51,334
I was in love with a boy called François,
who had your lovely eyes.

752
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:55,880
Unfortunately, he was in love with a girl
called Marie, who had your teeth.

753
01:17:55,964 --> 01:17:59,008
She fell for a boy called Claude,
who broke my heart

754
01:17:59,092 --> 01:18:00,760
and who I intend to marry one day.

755
01:18:06,099 --> 01:18:07,600
Eyes on me.

756
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:09,769
No talking.

757
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:12,981
Today, we learn to jump.

758
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:17,235
Did you know the French cleared
the 1.85 metre at the Paris Olympics

759
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:20,780
to win the gold medal?
Today, we will beat that record.

760
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:26,077
This is your jump.

761
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:29,330
When I call you,
be very brave and leap over it!

762
01:18:31,499 --> 01:18:33,376
Leap over it!

763
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:34,502
Watch me.

764
01:18:39,007 --> 01:18:40,967
And now it's your...

765
01:19:20,465 --> 01:19:24,844
He doesn't think we can do it.
But we will show him, won't we?

766
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,902
No need to be afraid.

767
01:19:43,363 --> 01:19:46,199
You are very tall.

768
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:50,703
You'll kill yourself.

769
01:19:51,037 --> 01:19:53,206
Only if you get in my way
to make me fall.

770
01:19:53,373 --> 01:19:55,708
Oh, please. Come off the...

771
01:20:07,595 --> 01:20:09,847
Find somewhere to hide them.

772
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:11,599
And do it quickly.

773
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:53,391
My name is Bonnard. This is my land.
Why are you here?

774
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:58,104
Food. For the soldiers at the front.
Everyone must give their share.

775
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:23,796
They are taking everything.

776
01:21:25,131 --> 01:21:27,008
Where are the horses?

777
01:21:28,176 --> 01:21:29,927
What horses?

778
01:21:41,481 --> 01:21:45,067
- What is it?
- Leave it if you don't know what it's for.

779
01:21:45,151 --> 01:21:47,862
A pot is a pot. We'll find some use for it.

780
01:21:48,863 --> 01:21:50,114
Sir.

781
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:54,744
- Where's the livestock?
- I make jam. We have no animals.

782
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:57,121
But there's fresh hay in your barn.

783
01:21:57,205 --> 01:22:00,708
We use it
to replace the mattress stuffings.

784
01:22:06,339 --> 01:22:08,508
- Her grandfather?
- Yes.

785
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:11,552
- Where are her parents?
- They're dead.

786
01:22:12,386 --> 01:22:13,721
They died.

787
01:22:16,224 --> 01:22:17,308
What is that?

788
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:20,895
The wind. It plays tricks in the attic.

789
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:23,356
There is no wind.

790
01:22:23,731 --> 01:22:25,900
An old house creaks.

791
01:22:26,192 --> 01:22:28,361
Go, close the shutters.

792
01:22:35,576 --> 01:22:37,620
She's sickly, no?

793
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:42,375
If you or any of your friends harm her,

794
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:47,046
as old as I am, I will kill you.

795
01:22:56,222 --> 01:23:00,184
You know,
I was going to give you back your pot.

796
01:23:00,268 --> 01:23:02,228
But now I'm going to keep it.

797
01:23:04,772 --> 01:23:06,107
For soup.

798
01:23:08,109 --> 01:23:09,193
We will be back.

799
01:23:10,403 --> 01:23:12,071
In the new season.

800
01:23:37,138 --> 01:23:39,599
Tell me what happened to them.

801
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:42,935
To my mother and father.

802
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:47,273
You said you would tell me
how they died

803
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,401
on my birthday.

804
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:53,112
And tomorrow's my birthday.

805
01:23:54,822 --> 01:23:56,490
They died fighting.

806
01:23:58,826 --> 01:24:00,286
Didn't they?

807
01:24:01,037 --> 01:24:02,788
But when the soldiers come,

808
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:06,292
you do nothing.

809
01:24:07,293 --> 01:24:10,004
- You are a coward, aren't you?
- Yes.

810
01:24:10,129 --> 01:24:13,174
It was your parents who were brave.

811
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:15,468
I make jams.

812
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:20,973
And you've never done a brave thing
in your life?

813
01:24:26,312 --> 01:24:29,815
Maybe there are different ways
to be brave.

814
01:24:32,068 --> 01:24:37,073
Did you know the French
have the best carrier pigeons?

815
01:24:37,657 --> 01:24:40,826
And this could be the difference
in the war,

816
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:43,496
our messages getting through.

817
01:24:44,205 --> 01:24:46,832
I don't want to hear about the birds.

818
01:24:49,377 --> 01:24:55,007
They are released at the front
and told to go home.

819
01:24:55,508 --> 01:24:57,510
This is all they know.

820
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:03,724
But to get there,
they must fly over a war.

821
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:07,186
Can you imagine such a thing?

822
01:25:08,938 --> 01:25:11,607
Here you are flying over

823
01:25:12,066 --> 01:25:17,405
so much pain and terror,
and you know you can never look down.

824
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:21,242
You have to look forward,
or you'll never get home.

825
01:25:23,202 --> 01:25:26,914
I ask you,
what could be braver than that?

826
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:05,411
- What is that?
- A present.

827
01:26:06,412 --> 01:26:09,498
I hope you have not bought me
a disgusting dress

828
01:26:09,582 --> 01:26:11,500
that I then have to wear, like last year.

829
01:26:11,584 --> 01:26:13,043
It was disgusting?

830
01:26:13,127 --> 01:26:14,211
Yes.

831
01:26:14,295 --> 01:26:16,005
I looked like an ugly nun.

832
01:26:19,842 --> 01:26:21,510
Give me your hand.

833
01:26:24,305 --> 01:26:27,141
<i>Grand-Grand-père., we</i> have no money!

834
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:31,937
When the war is over, then you can
buy me jewels and carriages.

835
01:26:32,021 --> 01:26:35,733
Anything you say, my sweet one.
Anything you say.

836
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:38,319
You are, of course, the boss.

837
01:26:38,444 --> 01:26:40,571
It's just an old thing I found.

838
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:43,949
Don't worry yourself. Leave it.
I'll put it back.

839
01:27:10,476 --> 01:27:12,186
It was your mother's.

840
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:15,689
I hid it so as not to encourage you.

841
01:27:17,024 --> 01:27:21,278
Emilie, I want you to ride very slowly.
Very carefully.

842
01:27:21,362 --> 01:27:23,697
- And promise me you won't go far.
- Of course.

843
01:27:23,823 --> 01:27:26,367
To the top of the hill
and straight back again.

844
01:27:26,492 --> 01:27:28,035
I promise.

845
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,495
My hero!

846
01:27:36,502 --> 01:27:38,337
Slowly. Slowly.

847
01:27:51,559 --> 01:27:52,852
Emilie!

848
01:27:54,562 --> 01:27:56,063
Emilie!

849
01:28:30,723 --> 01:28:34,101
- Let go of me! No!
- She is my granddaughter!

850
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:37,062
- François!
- Emilie, stop! Don't hurt her, please!

851
01:28:37,897 --> 01:28:39,607
- Don't hurt her.
- No!

852
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:47,114
You don't need them.
There are so many others!

853
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:50,701
Please, take the bigger one
and leave the smaller one.

854
01:28:51,285 --> 01:28:54,079
You are breaking
my granddaughter's heart.

855
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:59,126
The war has taken everything
from everyone.

856
01:29:01,253 --> 01:29:05,382
- What will happen to them?
- They will pull artillery until they die.

857
01:29:05,466 --> 01:29:07,468
Or until the war is over.

858
01:29:08,302 --> 01:29:10,471
It will never be over!

859
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:13,474
You have your answer then.

860
01:29:51,971 --> 01:29:53,430
Heiglemann.

861
01:29:53,514 --> 01:29:55,516
- These are yours.
- Yes, sir.

862
01:29:55,641 --> 01:29:59,019
They look strong.
Should last a month or two.

863
01:30:05,359 --> 01:30:07,027
You're beautiful.

864
01:30:16,495 --> 01:30:18,664
It's a pity they found you.

865
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:22,835
Such a pity.

866
01:30:32,344 --> 01:30:35,681
Pull together, men!
Pull together!

867
01:30:36,515 --> 01:30:40,519
Together, men! Together!
Put your backs into it!

868
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:48,652
Steady pace! Steady pace!

869
01:30:48,736 --> 01:30:51,864
- Watch out, number three's slacking!
- Move it, move it!

870
01:30:56,535 --> 01:30:59,204
Halt! Halt! Break!

871
01:30:59,872 --> 01:31:02,207
Break! Stop! Stop!

872
01:31:19,433 --> 01:31:22,186
Heiglemann! Bring out another one!

873
01:31:22,269 --> 01:31:25,064
Heiglemann, bring up another horse!

874
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:26,732
That one!

875
01:31:32,738 --> 01:31:35,783
No, no! The big black one!

876
01:31:54,468 --> 01:31:56,136
He's a good horse, sir.

877
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:59,807
But if you move him up to
the heavy gun, he will be no use at all.

878
01:31:59,932 --> 01:32:02,726
Prince is already losing condition.
His leg, sir.

879
01:32:02,810 --> 01:32:05,020
- You have given them names?
- Yes, sir.

880
01:32:05,104 --> 01:32:08,065
You should never give a name
to anything you are certain to lose.

881
01:32:08,148 --> 01:32:10,150
But his leg is not good enough, sir.

882
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:13,487
Private, you will do as you are told.

883
01:32:13,612 --> 01:32:14,863
Hook him up!

884
01:32:24,832 --> 01:32:27,501
Can't you see, sir? This one is stronger.

885
01:32:27,918 --> 01:32:29,253
Hook him up!

886
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:07,166
No slacking!

887
01:33:07,499 --> 01:33:10,002
Keep it taut! Use your whip!

888
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:57,090
No slacking! To the top!

889
01:34:03,889 --> 01:34:05,557
Halt!

890
01:34:06,892 --> 01:34:08,727
Take the horses away.

891
01:34:17,569 --> 01:34:19,071
Shell!

892
01:34:27,746 --> 01:34:29,414
And load!

893
01:34:34,753 --> 01:34:36,088
Back!

894
01:34:37,089 --> 01:34:38,298
Case!

895
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:44,763
Position!

896
01:34:50,978 --> 01:34:52,396
And

897
01:34:53,272 --> 01:34:54,439
fire!

898
01:35:32,185 --> 01:35:37,107
Valuables in the bucket, lads!
If you live, you'll get them back!

899
01:35:37,941 --> 01:35:40,610
If you live, you get them back.
Good luck!

900
01:35:40,819 --> 01:35:42,696
Valuables in the bucket!

901
01:35:55,334 --> 01:35:58,503
The blood of Christ
keep thee in eternal life.

902
01:35:59,171 --> 01:36:01,089
In the name of the Father
and of the Son...

903
01:36:01,173 --> 01:36:05,135
Maybe it's a drill, Albie.
Maybe it's a drill, like last time.

904
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:10,432
Love letter?

905
01:36:13,935 --> 01:36:15,604
Well, that's my business.

906
01:36:16,772 --> 01:36:21,777
I hear you and your mate
were doing bird imitations again.

907
01:36:23,028 --> 01:36:25,447
Are you going to write a letter
to your horse?

908
01:36:25,781 --> 01:36:27,282
After you find your horse,

909
01:36:27,366 --> 01:36:30,786
I've lost my needle in a haystack
and I could use some help.

910
01:36:31,703 --> 01:36:33,246
Anything valuable!

911
01:36:33,330 --> 01:36:36,875
Anyone who comes back
gets to share it out!

912
01:36:37,542 --> 01:36:39,044
Stay here.

913
01:36:41,713 --> 01:36:44,800
Remember that day me and Joey
raced you in your car?

914
01:36:44,883 --> 01:36:47,135
I remember you somersaulting
through the air.

915
01:36:47,219 --> 01:36:49,054
Who was that girl you were with?

916
01:36:49,638 --> 01:36:51,139
There was a girl?

917
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:54,226
There was. Don't you remember?

918
01:36:54,309 --> 01:36:57,896
It was just some girl, I suppose.
I don't recall which one.

919
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:01,733
I do remember you
falling on your bum in a ditch.

920
01:37:02,067 --> 01:37:03,235
You see?

921
01:37:03,652 --> 01:37:07,155
Always entertaining, Narracott.
I'll give you that.

922
01:37:08,156 --> 01:37:11,076
You did that? You fell on your bum?

923
01:37:20,836 --> 01:37:23,839
Into position! Everyone ready!

924
01:37:24,673 --> 01:37:28,343
- There she goes!
- Into position! Let's go!

925
01:37:29,094 --> 01:37:31,096
- Go! Choke on it!
- Yes, Sarge!

926
01:37:31,179 --> 01:37:34,266
Be brave, boys! Be ready! Be ready!

927
01:37:34,599 --> 01:37:36,893
Let's go, men, get ready to go!

928
01:37:39,104 --> 01:37:40,772
Hold your nerve, boys!

929
01:37:40,856 --> 01:37:43,942
Remember, it's not too far to go,
there's a way through!

930
01:37:44,025 --> 01:37:47,154
Run fast, keep your wits about you,
keep your eyes open,

931
01:37:47,237 --> 01:37:49,281
and God and the King
will keep an eye on you.

932
01:37:49,364 --> 01:37:53,034
Company will fix bayonets!
Fix bayonets!

933
01:37:53,702 --> 01:37:55,537
You know what it reminds me of
out there?

934
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:57,372
- What?
- That bloody impossible lower field

935
01:37:57,456 --> 01:37:59,207
the day me and Joey ploughed it.

936
01:37:59,291 --> 01:38:02,461
Best day of my life, that was,
and you were there.

937
01:38:02,961 --> 01:38:05,881
And this here is the worst day of my life
about to begin,

938
01:38:05,964 --> 01:38:09,468
and you're here cheering me on.
Us two, always!

939
01:38:10,135 --> 01:38:11,219
And him.

940
01:38:11,303 --> 01:38:13,388
Once you're in no man's land,
go to the flank,

941
01:38:13,472 --> 01:38:14,598
- stay on the flank.
- Yes, sir.

942
01:38:14,681 --> 01:38:17,392
- Come on, boys, to the ladders!
- Stick close to the gentry, yeah?

943
01:38:17,476 --> 01:38:20,729
That's our ticket. We have the pluck,
but they have the luck.

944
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:22,647
Come on, boys, keep going.
Keep going.

945
01:38:22,731 --> 01:38:23,815
Andrew.

946
01:38:24,232 --> 01:38:25,901
You, too, Narracott.

947
01:38:25,984 --> 01:38:27,319
And you, too.

948
01:38:46,588 --> 01:38:48,423
Come on. On your ladders, boys!
On your ladders.

949
01:38:48,507 --> 01:38:50,592
In you go! In you go! That's it!

950
01:38:52,177 --> 01:38:54,095
Listen to your Sergeant!

951
01:38:54,429 --> 01:38:57,098
If anybody turns back,

952
01:38:57,182 --> 01:39:01,019
if any one of our boys
comes running towards you,

953
01:39:01,436 --> 01:39:06,107
you take this rifle
and you shoot them dead!

954
01:39:06,191 --> 01:39:08,568
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir!

955
01:39:08,693 --> 01:39:11,738
Do you understand me? Do you
understand what I'm telling you, son?

956
01:39:11,863 --> 01:39:14,866
You take this rifle
and you shoot them dead.

957
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:16,701
You understand?

958
01:39:19,704 --> 01:39:23,375
Up there, son. Up your ladder!
Up your ladder to your work!

959
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:25,627
It's good. Andrew, it's good.

960
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:27,295
Andrew!

961
01:39:27,879 --> 01:39:29,714
Nobody's retreating today.

962
01:39:30,382 --> 01:39:34,135
Andrew! Andrew,
nobody is retreating today!

963
01:39:46,398 --> 01:39:49,067
Ready to go over the top!

964
01:41:04,643 --> 01:41:07,145
Just leave me! Leave me!

965
01:41:21,201 --> 01:41:24,746
You'll be all right here. You'll be safe.
Someone will come for you.

966
01:41:25,914 --> 01:41:27,082
Albert.

967
01:41:27,832 --> 01:41:29,501
- Albert, listen.
- It's all right.

968
01:41:29,584 --> 01:41:33,088
It's all right. We're Devon boys. Yeah?

969
01:41:35,674 --> 01:41:36,758
Yeah.

970
01:42:58,339 --> 01:42:59,841
Get down!

971
01:44:31,891 --> 01:44:33,017
No!

972
01:44:37,689 --> 01:44:39,357
Albie.

973
01:44:51,536 --> 01:44:52,871
We made it.

974
01:44:53,746 --> 01:44:55,081
We made it.

975
01:45:08,761 --> 01:45:11,264
Andrew! This way out!

976
01:45:12,765 --> 01:45:14,767
Gas, gas, gas!

977
01:45:18,396 --> 01:45:19,647
Albie.

978
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:53,848
There's no stopping here.
Keep them moving!

979
01:45:53,932 --> 01:45:57,685
But, sir, there's something wrong.
This one needs to rest.

980
01:45:57,769 --> 01:46:01,606
There's no rest for them.
Move them along! Move them along!

981
01:46:22,627 --> 01:46:26,130
Please, please, please.
Stay on your feet. No, please!

982
01:46:26,464 --> 01:46:27,590
No, no, no.

983
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:31,636
No. Please.

984
01:46:31,970 --> 01:46:34,305
Please. Stay on your feet.

985
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:36,641
Come on, come on. Please.

986
01:46:36,766 --> 01:46:39,769
No, please. Stay on your feet. Come on.

987
01:47:35,867 --> 01:47:38,703
They're coming. Leave it, Private!
Leave it!

988
01:47:39,037 --> 01:47:40,371
Come with me.

989
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:42,331
Go to hell!

990
01:47:45,168 --> 01:47:46,377
Run!

991
01:47:47,170 --> 01:47:50,006
Run! Run!

992
01:47:50,715 --> 01:47:51,799
Run!

993
01:47:52,341 --> 01:47:53,384
Run!

994
01:51:07,870 --> 01:51:09,789
<i>Stand to, stand to.</i>

995
01:51:10,957 --> 01:51:12,792
There's something moving.

996
01:51:13,209 --> 01:51:15,127
What the hell is it?

997
01:51:17,713 --> 01:51:19,799
It looks like a cow.

998
01:51:20,299 --> 01:51:23,469
What the hell would a cow
be doing up there?

999
01:51:28,307 --> 01:51:30,309
That definitely isn't a cow.

1000
01:51:30,977 --> 01:51:32,144
Well, what is it?

1001
01:51:32,395 --> 01:51:35,398
It can't be a horse.
Nothing alive could be out there.

1002
01:51:35,481 --> 01:51:38,484
It isn't a horse. It isn't a horse!

1003
01:51:41,070 --> 01:51:42,238
Yes, it's a horse.

1004
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:46,075
- It's a horse.
- Yeah, it's a horse.

1005
01:51:46,325 --> 01:51:48,160
Well, bugger me.

1006
01:51:49,495 --> 01:51:50,997
It's a horse!

1007
01:51:55,001 --> 01:51:57,169
Lads, we should call him.

1008
01:51:58,087 --> 01:51:59,922
How do you call a horse?

1009
01:52:42,048 --> 01:52:44,091
He's caught on the wire.

1010
01:52:48,721 --> 01:52:50,514
Oh, sod it.

1011
01:52:58,189 --> 01:53:00,066
What do you
think you're doing?

1012
01:53:00,733 --> 01:53:02,735
Get back, do you hear me?

1013
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:05,279
Corporal, that's an order. Get back!

1014
01:53:06,572 --> 01:53:09,241
Listen to him, sir. We can't leave him.

1015
01:53:10,034 --> 01:53:11,535
What's he doing?

1016
01:53:11,869 --> 01:53:13,204
It's a trap.

1017
01:53:13,746 --> 01:53:16,499
No, I don't think so.
I think he's trying to help.

1018
01:53:16,582 --> 01:53:18,959
Scare him back into his hole.

1019
01:53:26,217 --> 01:53:28,219
It's a white flag, isn't it?

1020
01:53:28,552 --> 01:53:30,388
You see the white flag?

1021
01:53:31,097 --> 01:53:33,933
I'm just after tending to this here horse
is all!

1022
01:53:37,937 --> 01:53:40,439
Get back, you stupid git!

1023
01:53:41,565 --> 01:53:44,902
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

1024
01:53:46,612 --> 01:53:48,948
"He leadeth me into green pastures.

1025
01:53:49,949 --> 01:53:53,619
"He leadeth me down
beside still waters."

1026
01:54:08,634 --> 01:54:10,302
Poor beastie.

1027
01:54:11,762 --> 01:54:13,097
Poor babbie.

1028
01:54:13,472 --> 01:54:17,476
It's all right.
It's all right, don't buck and wriggle so.

1029
01:54:18,936 --> 01:54:20,813
You're only shredding yourself.

1030
01:54:22,648 --> 01:54:24,316
You'll blind yourself.

1031
01:54:27,111 --> 01:54:30,448
Bugger me worthless. I didn't think to
bring gloves or something to cut the...

1032
01:54:30,531 --> 01:54:32,283
Ow!

1033
01:54:35,453 --> 01:54:37,997
I thought perhaps
you might need these.

1034
01:54:38,122 --> 01:54:39,665
For the barbed wire.

1035
01:54:41,333 --> 01:54:44,003
Yeah. Yeah, I...

1036
01:54:44,670 --> 01:54:46,005
Thanks.

1037
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:47,965
Cheers.

1038
01:54:48,674 --> 01:54:50,176
Cheers.

1039
01:54:50,301 --> 01:54:51,469
Thanks.

1040
01:54:59,977 --> 01:55:02,688
That's a very long strand.

1041
01:55:02,813 --> 01:55:05,691
And when you cut it, it's going to release

1042
01:55:07,276 --> 01:55:10,446
this, and this, and this.

1043
01:55:10,988 --> 01:55:12,656
And they'll coil back rather violently,

1044
01:55:12,781 --> 01:55:14,825
which, I'm afraid, will only wound
the poor fellow further.

1045
01:55:16,494 --> 01:55:18,329
You speak good English.

1046
01:55:19,872 --> 01:55:21,832
I speak English well.

1047
01:55:22,708 --> 01:55:23,876
May I?

1048
01:55:35,387 --> 01:55:37,598
What if we cut his head free first,

1049
01:55:37,681 --> 01:55:40,226
so he won't try to stand up
and blind himself?

1050
01:55:40,351 --> 01:55:42,645
- And then...
- Pity you didn't bring a second pair.

1051
01:55:42,728 --> 01:55:44,563
Then I could cut the wire here.

1052
01:55:45,022 --> 01:55:47,316
We need more wire cutters!

1053
01:55:58,536 --> 01:55:59,870
His blind spot.

1054
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:02,915
The cutters won't frighten him.

1055
01:56:04,041 --> 01:56:07,336
If you could cut here, holding this wire,

1056
01:56:07,419 --> 01:56:10,548
- I could...
- Say no more. I'm right behind you.

1057
01:56:10,673 --> 01:56:13,801
And you understand what's happening,
do you not, O Best Beloved?

1058
01:56:13,884 --> 01:56:16,595
And you must lay so very nice and still.

1059
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:18,222
There's a lad.

1060
01:56:18,389 --> 01:56:21,892
A remarkable horse, you are,
helping us help you.

1061
01:56:22,768 --> 01:56:24,353
There's a lad.

1062
01:56:24,436 --> 01:56:26,397
There's a remarkable lad.

1063
01:56:30,568 --> 01:56:32,903
So, how's things in yonder trench?

1064
01:56:34,071 --> 01:56:35,197
Delightful.

1065
01:56:35,281 --> 01:56:39,410
We read, we knit sweaters, and we
train our rats to perform circus tricks.

1066
01:56:39,702 --> 01:56:42,121
If you ever need any more rats,
we can always send ours over

1067
01:56:42,246 --> 01:56:44,206
'cause we've more than we need,
strictly speaking.

1068
01:56:45,958 --> 01:56:48,127
Besides, they scare off
all the pretty girls.

1069
01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:49,920
Our girls aren't afraid of rats.

1070
01:56:51,463 --> 01:56:53,465
Big strapping German girls, eh?

1071
01:56:54,133 --> 01:56:56,302
Kind what give robust massages?

1072
01:56:58,137 --> 01:56:59,805
Every Thursday.

1073
01:56:59,930 --> 01:57:02,474
And they bring rum cake
on your birthday.

1074
01:57:15,446 --> 01:57:17,615
Okay. All right.

1075
01:57:22,119 --> 01:57:24,121
Look at that horse!

1076
01:57:24,538 --> 01:57:28,042
Look at the muscles he's got.
Them long legs.

1077
01:57:28,125 --> 01:57:31,795
They're made for running, horses.
Running away from danger.

1078
01:57:33,213 --> 01:57:35,299
Running away is all they have.

1079
01:57:35,382 --> 01:57:37,718
And yet we taught 'em opposite.

1080
01:57:37,801 --> 01:57:40,429
Running into the fray.

1081
01:57:41,055 --> 01:57:42,723
- A war horse.
- Yeah.

1082
01:57:44,558 --> 01:57:45,893
War horse.

1083
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:48,228
There he is.

1084
01:57:48,312 --> 01:57:50,814
What a strange beast you've become.

1085
01:57:53,150 --> 01:57:54,485
And now?

1086
01:57:54,568 --> 01:57:56,403
I'll take him back with me, yeah?

1087
01:57:57,071 --> 01:58:01,241
Since I supplied the cutters,
the horse is mine. This is fair, no?

1088
01:58:01,325 --> 01:58:03,744
In a pig's eye.
He's English, plain to see.

1089
01:58:03,827 --> 01:58:06,664
- You mean because he's so filthy?
- Because he's so smart!

1090
01:58:06,789 --> 01:58:08,791
And you're none too clean yourself.

1091
01:58:11,418 --> 01:58:14,588
We could box.
And the winner gets the horse.

1092
01:58:17,091 --> 01:58:21,136
No, thanks, pet.
Must be careful not to start a war.

1093
01:58:23,597 --> 01:58:25,849
Do you have a coin of any sort?

1094
01:58:26,684 --> 01:58:28,352
- Coin toss?
- Yeah.

1095
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:34,817
- All right, Fritz, you're on.
- My name is not Fritz.

1096
01:58:35,109 --> 01:58:36,443
It is Peter.

1097
01:58:37,903 --> 01:58:39,571
Peter. I'm Colin.

1098
01:58:39,905 --> 01:58:42,032
- You call it, Colin.
- Heads.

1099
01:58:47,663 --> 01:58:52,000
That's the face of my Kaiser,
and he does not look pleased with me.

1100
01:58:53,836 --> 01:58:55,504
The horse is yours.

1101
01:58:56,422 --> 01:58:58,090
Gone quiet, hasn't it?

1102
01:58:58,757 --> 01:59:00,175
Yes.

1103
01:59:00,259 --> 01:59:03,011
But wait half an hour
and we'll be shooting again.

1104
01:59:03,095 --> 01:59:07,015
I'm a terrible shot, Pete.
Don't believe I'll ever hit a target.

1105
01:59:08,434 --> 01:59:09,768
Thanks.

1106
01:59:11,854 --> 01:59:13,272
Cheerio, mate.

1107
01:59:13,355 --> 01:59:15,691
- You'll take good care of him, yes?
- I will.

1108
01:59:15,774 --> 01:59:17,568
Our strange beast.

1109
01:59:17,651 --> 01:59:19,987
And you take care
of your own strange self.

1110
01:59:20,612 --> 01:59:21,864
Colin!

1111
01:59:23,282 --> 01:59:24,908
A pair of German cutters.

1112
01:59:24,992 --> 01:59:27,578
In memory of your handsome friend
from Düsseldorf.

1113
01:59:27,661 --> 01:59:31,373
Thanks. I'll use them back
in the garden in South Shields.

1114
01:59:31,457 --> 01:59:33,667
You keep your head down now, Pete,
my lad.

1115
01:59:35,836 --> 01:59:38,839
Remarkable.
A remarkable horse!

1116
02:00:16,543 --> 02:00:18,337
We're full up. Move on.

1117
02:00:20,172 --> 02:00:21,840
We're full up. Move on.

1118
02:00:24,718 --> 02:00:28,055
The gas got him.
We had to wait till morning.

1119
02:00:32,559 --> 02:00:35,521
- This can't be all of us.
- This is all.

1120
02:00:35,604 --> 02:00:37,397
All walking wounded

1121
02:00:37,731 --> 02:00:40,984
away to the dressing station!

1122
02:00:41,068 --> 02:00:44,238
Away to the dressing station!

1123
02:00:58,168 --> 02:00:59,795
Just hold still.

1124
02:00:59,878 --> 02:01:01,755
You're doing so well.

1125
02:01:22,067 --> 02:01:24,319
- What's this doing here?
- We need a vet, sir.

1126
02:01:24,403 --> 02:01:26,905
There are no vets.
There are scarcely any horses left.

1127
02:01:26,989 --> 02:01:29,783
He's cut all over,
but this leg here has got the worst of it.

1128
02:01:36,790 --> 02:01:39,626
- It's probably tetanus. It's no good.
- Please, sir!

1129
02:01:39,710 --> 02:01:42,296
I've all these men to take care of,
Corporal. You can see that, can't you?

1130
02:01:42,379 --> 02:01:45,632
Please, sir,
this horse can pull through anything!

1131
02:01:56,435 --> 02:01:57,853
What is it?

1132
02:01:58,478 --> 02:02:02,232
It's a horse they found wandering about
in no man's land. Down you go.

1133
02:02:02,316 --> 02:02:03,400
What kind of a horse?

1134
02:02:03,483 --> 02:02:06,194
Bloody miraculous kind of a horse
be my guess.

1135
02:02:06,278 --> 02:02:08,655
Nothing makes it out of no man's land.

1136
02:02:13,785 --> 02:02:15,621
Miraculous horse.

1137
02:02:17,789 --> 02:02:20,417
He was alive, you see, sir,
where nothing survives.

1138
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:23,295
So to me and my mates,
to the men, sir, he's...

1139
02:02:23,378 --> 02:02:24,755
Well, we have high hopes for him.

1140
02:02:24,838 --> 02:02:26,882
You should shoot him now.

1141
02:02:27,674 --> 02:02:30,886
- Oh, but I can't.
- It'd be a mercy, lad.

1142
02:02:30,969 --> 02:02:33,221
That leg's not going to mend.

1143
02:02:33,305 --> 02:02:34,640
Sergeant.

1144
02:02:36,141 --> 02:02:38,185
Put him out of his misery.

1145
02:02:43,857 --> 02:02:45,943
He's not going to
shoot it here, is he?

1146
02:02:46,026 --> 02:02:47,444
What's going on here?

1147
02:02:47,527 --> 02:02:49,279
They're going
to shoot the horse.

1148
02:02:49,363 --> 02:02:51,406
Ladies, if you please.

1149
02:02:51,490 --> 02:02:52,699
Come, nurses.

1150
02:02:57,537 --> 02:03:01,208
All right, back off! Back off!

1151
02:04:13,071 --> 02:04:15,949
Go on, do it again. Go on.

1152
02:04:23,081 --> 02:04:24,249
Joey?

1153
02:04:43,268 --> 02:04:46,813
Hello, Joey. Where you been then, eh?

1154
02:04:48,106 --> 02:04:49,941
Where in the world you been?

1155
02:04:50,067 --> 02:04:51,902
Do you know this man?

1156
02:04:52,652 --> 02:04:55,030
- What's your name?
- Narracott.

1157
02:04:55,113 --> 02:04:56,323
Private Albert Narracott, sir.

1158
02:04:56,406 --> 02:04:59,868
It's just a random horse, Narracott,
and too badly injured.

1159
02:04:59,951 --> 02:05:01,578
- Is this man in your care?
- Yes, sir.

1160
02:05:01,661 --> 02:05:06,666
He's not random at all, sir!
He's my horse. I raised him, in Devon.

1161
02:05:07,793 --> 02:05:09,586
Sir, look at his legs.

1162
02:05:09,669 --> 02:05:12,422
He's got four white socks,
he's brown all over,

1163
02:05:12,506 --> 02:05:14,841
and he has a white mark here, like so.

1164
02:05:18,804 --> 02:05:20,931
- Take him back.
- Come on, son.

1165
02:05:21,014 --> 02:05:23,517
Wait! You can't see 'cause of the mud!

1166
02:05:57,175 --> 02:05:59,636
Four white socks.

1167
02:06:54,983 --> 02:06:58,570
All right, break it up!
Clear off, the lot of ya!

1168
02:06:58,987 --> 02:07:02,157
You see, sir? He's not random at all.

1169
02:07:05,327 --> 02:07:07,704
We'll attend to your horse.

1170
02:07:07,829 --> 02:07:09,664
Patch him up best we can.

1171
02:07:10,332 --> 02:07:12,375
Treat him like the soldier he is.

1172
02:07:13,335 --> 02:07:15,045
Thank you, sir.

1173
02:07:41,112 --> 02:07:42,447
Gentlemen!

1174
02:07:43,281 --> 02:07:44,616
Gentlemen!

1175
02:07:44,741 --> 02:07:47,744
It falls on me to give you
some important news.

1176
02:07:48,036 --> 02:07:51,957
At 11 :00 today, in two minutes' time,

1177
02:07:52,082 --> 02:07:54,376
the war will come to an end.

1178
02:07:55,877 --> 02:07:58,922
The King and Queen
thank you for your service.

1179
02:07:59,047 --> 02:08:01,007
We have been victorious,

1180
02:08:01,091 --> 02:08:04,928
even if it's a higher price
than many of us might have imagined.

1181
02:08:05,053 --> 02:08:06,930
When the bells ring out,

1182
02:08:07,055 --> 02:08:10,433
and they will in a moment,
for the first time in four years,

1183
02:08:10,517 --> 02:08:13,770
let us remember our brothers
fallen in the field,

1184
02:08:13,895 --> 02:08:16,064
and thank God
for the end of this struggle,

1185
02:08:17,190 --> 02:08:18,525
and victory.

1186
02:08:33,123 --> 02:08:34,624
I don't understand, sir.

1187
02:08:36,418 --> 02:08:40,797
Officers' horses only. All other horses
are to be auctioned immediately.

1188
02:08:40,922 --> 02:08:45,260
That is a complete and bloody outrage.
It's the lad's horse, sir! From Devon.

1189
02:08:45,719 --> 02:08:47,304
He raised him up from a pup, he did.

1190
02:08:47,429 --> 02:08:50,056
Trained him right up to the day
when the army came to town!

1191
02:08:50,140 --> 02:08:52,809
These aren't my orders, Sergeant.

1192
02:08:54,561 --> 02:08:57,814
You'll have to take him
to market tomorrow.

1193
02:08:57,897 --> 02:08:59,274
That's all.

1194
02:09:24,174 --> 02:09:25,925
We've all clubbed together.

1195
02:09:26,176 --> 02:09:28,303
It's everything we have.

1196
02:09:29,346 --> 02:09:32,682
There's 29 pounds there. Buy him back.

1197
02:09:37,812 --> 02:09:38,938
Does the Major know?

1198
02:09:39,022 --> 02:09:41,691
The Major put in 10. Mum's the word
where the Major's concerned.

1199
02:09:41,816 --> 02:09:44,277
Your friend, on the crutches over there,

1200
02:09:44,361 --> 02:09:47,280
even asked the Major to say
that Joey was his, an officer's horse,

1201
02:09:47,364 --> 02:09:49,949
so that he could go back with the others.

1202
02:09:51,493 --> 02:09:54,704
Come on, Narracott, get a move on.
We don't want to miss the show.

1203
02:10:04,381 --> 02:10:07,050
<i>Seven pounds!
Seven pounds there!</i>

1204
02:10:07,384 --> 02:10:11,221
Seven pounds! Eight pounds here!
Eight pounds!

1205
02:10:11,346 --> 02:10:14,724
Ten pounds here! Any advance? Sold!

1206
02:10:14,849 --> 02:10:17,727
All right. No one's going to bid
more than 15 for a thoroughbred.

1207
02:10:17,852 --> 02:10:19,687
They want workhorses.

1208
02:10:22,816 --> 02:10:24,317
Next one!

1209
02:10:25,902 --> 02:10:27,654
We start at four pounds!

1210
02:10:28,363 --> 02:10:30,031
Four pounds!

1211
02:10:30,698 --> 02:10:32,867
- Five pounds!
- Five pounds here!

1212
02:10:33,201 --> 02:10:35,036
- Any advance?
- Seven pounds!

1213
02:10:35,120 --> 02:10:37,330
- Eight pounds!
- Nine pounds!

1214
02:10:37,414 --> 02:10:39,082
- Nine.
- Ten pounds!

1215
02:10:39,165 --> 02:10:40,291
Ten pounds!

1216
02:10:40,375 --> 02:10:41,835
- Eleven!
- Eleven!

1217
02:10:41,918 --> 02:10:46,047
It's the butcher from Cambrai. He's
been bidding for the best all morning.

1218
02:10:46,131 --> 02:10:47,799
Eleven pounds.

1219
02:10:47,882 --> 02:10:50,885
Let me handle this, Private. Fifteen!

1220
02:10:50,969 --> 02:10:52,637
And let that be an end to it!

1221
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:54,222
Fifteen pounds!

1222
02:10:54,305 --> 02:10:56,933
- Sixteen!
- Sixteen pounds.

1223
02:10:57,267 --> 02:10:58,601
Seventeen!

1224
02:10:58,935 --> 02:11:03,273
Twenty of your English pounds.
And let that be the end of it, my friend.

1225
02:11:03,565 --> 02:11:04,899
Twenty pounds!

1226
02:11:05,775 --> 02:11:07,485
- Twenty-five!
- Twenty-five pounds!

1227
02:11:08,111 --> 02:11:09,821
Twenty-six.

1228
02:11:09,904 --> 02:11:11,239
Twenty-six pounds!

1229
02:11:11,322 --> 02:11:13,658
- Twenty-seven!
- Twenty-eight!

1230
02:11:13,741 --> 02:11:14,951
Twenty-eight pounds.

1231
02:11:15,076 --> 02:11:16,202
Twenty-nine!

1232
02:11:16,286 --> 02:11:17,662
And thirty!

1233
02:11:17,745 --> 02:11:19,664
Any advance on thirty pounds?

1234
02:11:19,747 --> 02:11:21,749
One hundred pounds!

1235
02:11:27,464 --> 02:11:29,883
And, sir, if you bid against me,

1236
02:11:29,966 --> 02:11:34,554
I will sell the coat on my back
and bid to 110.

1237
02:11:34,637 --> 02:11:37,765
And if you bid against me again,
I will sell my farm,

1238
02:11:37,849 --> 02:11:39,934
and bid to a thousand!

1239
02:11:43,146 --> 02:11:45,148
One hundred pounds!

1240
02:11:46,774 --> 02:11:48,443
Going, going,

1241
02:11:48,902 --> 02:11:50,069
gone!

1242
02:11:59,496 --> 02:12:00,705
Sir,

1243
02:12:00,788 --> 02:12:03,208
I'll give you all your money,
everything you paid,

1244
02:12:03,291 --> 02:12:04,375
when we get back to England.

1245
02:12:04,459 --> 02:12:06,753
- I'll give you twice what...
- You don't know anything about him.

1246
02:12:06,836 --> 02:12:09,088
But you're wrong, sir. I know everything.

1247
02:12:09,172 --> 02:12:11,508
Yes, you found him.
I heard you found a horse

1248
02:12:11,591 --> 02:12:13,384
in the wire between the armies.

1249
02:12:13,468 --> 02:12:15,845
No, I found him. He raised him.

1250
02:12:17,847 --> 02:12:21,392
When I heard about the miracle horse,
I travelled three days

1251
02:12:21,476 --> 02:12:24,354
because I knew whose horse he was.

1252
02:12:25,188 --> 02:12:27,023
My granddaughter's.

1253
02:12:27,482 --> 02:12:31,194
She saved his life.
He was everything to her.

1254
02:12:31,277 --> 02:12:33,238
Where is your granddaughter?

1255
02:12:33,321 --> 02:12:35,949
The war has taken everything
from everyone.

1256
02:12:36,032 --> 02:12:38,493
He is all that I have left of her.

1257
02:13:01,849 --> 02:13:04,310
Don't be worried, boy, when I go.

1258
02:13:04,394 --> 02:13:06,771
I won't worry over you none.

1259
02:13:06,854 --> 02:13:08,815
Hey, I found you, didn't I?

1260
02:13:10,358 --> 02:13:12,026
And you found me.

1261
02:13:16,030 --> 02:13:17,532
And we'll both...

1262
02:13:18,241 --> 02:13:21,327
We'll both know
that we made it through.

1263
02:13:21,411 --> 02:13:22,745
Now come on.

1264
02:13:23,871 --> 02:13:26,874
We're the lucky ones.
Always have been.

1265
02:13:26,958 --> 02:13:29,252
Lucky since the day I met you.

1266
02:13:31,796 --> 02:13:33,298
God be with you, sir.

1267
02:13:36,217 --> 02:13:38,303
Do you know what this is?

1268
02:13:42,599 --> 02:13:44,267
That's my father's.

1269
02:13:44,934 --> 02:13:46,936
That's his regimental pennant.

1270
02:13:53,901 --> 02:13:55,903
How did you come by this, sir?

1271
02:13:58,281 --> 02:14:00,366
You may have this.

1272
02:14:08,499 --> 02:14:11,294
Thank you ever so much for this, sir.

1273
02:14:14,964 --> 02:14:16,382
And this.

1274
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:26,726
- Sir, I...
- No, no, no.

1275
02:14:26,809 --> 02:14:29,646
Not necessary. He belongs to you.

1276
02:14:30,813 --> 02:14:33,816
That is, of course,
what my little girl would have wanted.

1277
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:35,818
And she was the boss.

1278
02:14:47,205 --> 02:14:48,539
What was her name?

1279
02:14:49,457 --> 02:14:50,792
Emilie.

1280
02:14:54,170 --> 02:14:56,172
Her name is Emilie.
