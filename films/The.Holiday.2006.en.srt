1
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:10,613
<i>I have found almost everything
ever written about love...</i>

2
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,114
<i>...to be true.</i>

3
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:16,327
<i>Shakespeare said,
"Journeys end in lovers meeting."</i>

4
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:18,329
<i>What an extraordinary thought.</i>

5
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:21,999
<i>Personally, I have not experienced
anything remotely close to that...</i>

6
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:25,253
<i>...but I'm more than willing to believe
Shakespeare had.</i>

7
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,798
<i>I suppose I think about love
more than anyone really should.</i>

8
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:34,428
<i>I'm constantly amazed by its sheer
power to alter and define our lives.</i>

9
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:37,598
<i>It was Shakespeare who also said,
"Love is blind."</i>

10
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:42,895
<i>Now, that is something
I know to be true.</i>

11
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:58,369
<i>For some, quite inexplicably...</i>

12
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:00,705
<i>...love fades.</i>

13
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:16,929
<i>For others...</i>

14
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:19,223
<i>...love is simply lost.</i>

15
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:29,191
<i>But then, of course,
love can also be found.</i>

16
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,528
<i>Even if just for the night.</i>

17
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,702
<i>And then there's
another kind of love.</i>

18
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:41,329
<i>The cruelest kind.</i>

19
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,248
<i>The one that almost kills its victims.</i>

20
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:47,293
<i>It's called unrequited love.</i>

21
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,589
<i>Of that, I am an expert.</i>

22
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:55,926
<i>Most love stories are about people
who fall in love with each other.</i>

23
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:59,472
<i>But what about the rest of us?
What about our stories?</i>

24
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,099
<i>Those of us who fall in love alone.</i>

25
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:05,353
<i>We are the victims
of the one-sided affair.</i>

26
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,438
<i>We are the cursed
of the loved ones.</i>

27
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:10,399
<i>We are the unloved ones.
The walking wounded.</i>

28
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:14,070
<i>The handicapped without the
advantage of a great parking space.</i>

29
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,739
<i>Yes, you are looking at one
such individual.</i>

30
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:18,949
<i>And I have willingly loved...</i>

31
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:22,953
<i>...that man for over
three miserable years.</i>

32
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,456
<i>The absolute worst years of my life.</i>

33
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,792
<i>The worst Christmases,
the worst birthdays.</i>

34
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,670
<i>New Year's Eves brought in
by tears and Valium.</i>

35
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:35,883
<i>These years I've been in love have
been the darkest days of my life...</i>

36
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,303
<i>...all because I'm cursed by being
in love with a man who does not...</i>

37
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,806
<i>...and will not love me back.</i>

38
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,599
<i>Oh, God, just the sight of him.</i>

39
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:47,311
<i>Heart pounding, throat thickening,
absolutely can't swallow.</i>

40
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:50,147
<i>All the usual symptoms.</i>

41
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,108
Oh, Jasper.

42
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:56,779
- Don't tell me you're still--
- No, no, no, that's over. Very over.

43
00:03:56,946 --> 00:04:00,241
What's the story with you two anyway?
You were shagging him, weren't you?

44
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:02,952
More importantly, I was in love
with him, truth be known.

45
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:06,831
Then you found out he was shagging
that drip from Circulation.

46
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,041
Which is when I stopped
shagging him.

47
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,669
We shouldn't be talking
about this at the office party.

48
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:14,213
But I always see you two together.

49
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,174
He cheated on you,
but you stayed friends?

50
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:22,388
I was head over heels, you know?
Everyone knew.

51
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:25,391
- Does it look like I'm crying right now?
- No, no, no.

52
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:28,519
No, it just looks like it's the smoke
from my cigarette.

53
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:32,273
Did he ever actually tell you
that he loved you back?

54
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,735
Yes. Three, almost four times.
And when I reminded him of that...

55
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,280
... he said it must have been an answer
to a question.

56
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:42,825
Which, by the way,
it absolutely was not.

57
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:47,163
You know, Iris, when you catch
your guy with another woman...

58
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,457
...you're not supposed
to stay friends with him.

59
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,750
You're supposed to never
talk to the prick again.

60
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:55,212
You're supposed to throw things
at him, scream, call him names.

61
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,006
Not do his blooming laundry.

62
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:58,716
I don't do his laundry.

63
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:01,677
Did someone tell you
I do his laundry?

64
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:04,054
No, no, all we do now is...

65
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,765
...we e-mail.

66
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,601
Not when he's with her, of course.

67
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:12,396
Also when he's not with her,
we talk on the phone.

68
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:17,026
Sometimes for hours. And then
there's the occasional long lunch.

69
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:20,029
You know, I never realized
how pathetic you are.

70
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:21,739
Really?

71
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:25,159
Oh, God. I'm so aware of it.

72
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,745
They always know just
how to get us, don't they?

73
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,122
He knows whenever he wants
back in your life--

74
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:33,375
Actually, he has made some small
comments like that recently.

75
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,544
He hasn't exactly come
right out and said it--

76
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,630
Iris, did you file your story?

77
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:42,259
Oh, no, not yet.
Down to the wire. Sorry.

78
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,261
Better go.

79
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:50,100
- -Groom's best friend spoke...

80
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:54,855
...for many guests
when he said, "Hilary...

81
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,943
...will open Edward's eyes...

82
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:02,530
...and round out his life."

83
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,324
Okay, I've got a question for you.

84
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,622
What's it like to be the only one
committed to work...

85
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,415
...while the rest of us
are slumming?

86
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,584
You mean what's it like
to be the only one...

87
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,586
... not to finish their work on time?

88
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:20,422
Hold on. Don't-- Don't go.

89
00:06:20,965 --> 00:06:23,467
Is it fun having a brain
that works that fast?

90
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,553
- Shut up.
- No, I mean it.

91
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,639
Probably a brilliant finish too.

92
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:30,933
I assure you it's not.

93
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,271
- Hi, Simpkey.
- Hi.

94
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:40,401
Your column today was fantastic.

95
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:43,028
God, I loved that line:

96
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:48,367
"The onrushing stripping of dignity
and thought from British lives."

97
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,452
Great writing.

98
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:53,205
Hey, I got you something
for Christmas.

99
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:57,001
That's convenient
because I got you something too.

100
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,631
Darling, I don't actually
have my gift with me.

101
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:06,010
In fact, I probably mislaid it,
but I know I got you something.

102
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,846
I suspect it's somewhere in my car,
want to know what it is?

103
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,516
No. No, no, that's okay.

104
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,810
I know you're gonna look hot in it.

105
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,771
Well, let's hope you find it, then.

106
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,858
Not exactly something hot...

107
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:23,861
... but happy Christmas.

108
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,156
Thank you.

109
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:31,744
I didn't think we'd get a chance
to do this this year.

110
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,288
Remember last Christmas,
we exchanged gifts in March.

111
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:36,206
This is good.

112
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,208
We're getting better.

113
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:42,963
You stinker.

114
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,760
It's a first edition.

115
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,386
Where did you find it?

116
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:53,807
Buried in that little place we found
in Covent Garden that time.

117
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,395
Why are you so great?

118
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,025
Everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

119
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,653
Just a couple of minutes.
Thank you.

120
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,573
I hate it that we can never talk.

121
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,910
Hate it.

122
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:16,914
Well, first of all, a very
happy Christmas to every one of you.

123
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:18,248
Happy Christmas.

124
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:22,127
Now, we're not officially closed,
as you very well know.

125
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,380
But we are going to try
and get by this week...

126
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,257
...with a smaller-than-normal staff.

127
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,220
Now, before some of you
rush off on holiday...

128
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:35,182
... I do have one
rather important announcement.

129
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,101
Now, this affects Iris.

130
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,521
- Iris Simpkins, where are you?
- Here, sir.

131
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,482
- Iris, I have a tip for you.
- Excellent.

132
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:46,860
A wedding was privately
announced earlier today...

133
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:50,447
...that I don't believe any other paper
in town knows about.

134
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:55,160
And I want you to be the first to report
on this particular union...

135
00:08:55,327 --> 00:09:00,374
...as it is between two of our
most esteemed colleagues.

136
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,461
May I introduce the newly engaged
Sarah Smith-Alcott...

137
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:08,298
...and Jasper Bloom!

138
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,051
Come on.

139
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,815
If I had known this was going
to happen, I'd have worn my good suit.

140
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:54,815
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

141
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,435
Amanda!

142
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,277
Amanda.

143
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,991
Look, may I just say again...

144
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,535
...that I did not sleep with her?

145
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,289
Right, because your receptionist
needs to work till 3 in the morning.

146
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,625
A bunch of us were working all night.
She wanted to hang out.

147
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,254
Okay. Then swear on my life
that you didn't sleep with her.

148
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,089
Come on.

149
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:55,382
Go ahead.

150
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,801
Look, I don't wanna--
I'm not gonna--

151
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,678
Your receptionist, Ethan?

152
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:02,306
This is why I knew we were smart
never to get married.

153
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,641
I told you never to get rid
of your house.

154
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:07,311
Somewhere inside
I knew this about you.

155
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,730
First of all, can you please
calm down?

156
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,607
Because I did not
sleep with her.

157
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,901
Secondly, we've had problems
for over a year.

158
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,570
And I know you don't wanna deal
with that, but we have.

159
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:19,740
Oh, I am well aware we've
had problems for the last year.

160
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,784
If I work a little bit too much,
I never stop hearing about it.

161
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:25,370
But if you work too much,
maestro...

162
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,498
- ... it's for the sake of your music.
- "If" you work too much?

163
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,500
Amanda, you cut
75 trailers this year.

164
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,629
You put a cutting room in the house
and sleep with your BlackBerry.

165
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,006
And I'm not gonna have
a conversation about sex...

166
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,175
... because I can't remember
the last time we did it.

167
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,886
Come on, nobody has time for sex.

168
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,555
That's not entirely true.

169
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,433
That's it!
You absolutely slept with her!

170
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,352
Seriously, you have to get out.

171
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:49,519
Oh, God.

172
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,688
You know what I really think, Ethan?

173
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,733
- I don't think you ever really loved me.
- Oh, please.

174
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,446
You loved the idea of you and me, but
not so much me. Not me, not really.

175
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:03,367
Look, I did the best I could.
Is anybody good enough for that job?

176
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,372
I will send you your things.

177
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,042
You know you do this, right?

178
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,253
I mean, you screw up
every relationship you've ever been in.

179
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,964
It's what you do.

180
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,302
You didn't really wanna be a couple!
You resist it in your own way!

181
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,720
Shut up!

182
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,056
And it's hard to detect
how you even do it...

183
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:28,892
... because nobody's quite
as smart as you!

184
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,311
So you're hard to catch at it.

185
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,314
But it always surfaces
and this is what happens.

186
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,858
- What happens?
- Things end.

187
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,735
Just like you knew they would.

188
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:42,197
Amanda, you know how I feel
about you. There's nobody like you.

189
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,282
You just don't wanna be
what I need.

190
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,909
- Well, not what I "need."
- What?

191
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,078
I mean--
You know what I mean.

192
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:51,581
You know, I would never cheat on you,
not under any conditions.

193
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,375
Neither would I, okay?

194
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:56,420
Look at me. I'm down here
sweating like a pig. And look at you.

195
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,297
The only woman on Earth
who breaks up with her boyfriend...

196
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,758
...and doesn't even shed a tear?

197
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,969
I mean,
that's gotta mean something, right?

198
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:07,222
Why does it bug you so much
that I can't cry?

199
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,351
Esophageal spasm.

200
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,645
Oh, God, it's a big one.

201
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:20,277
- No, it's okay. I'll be all right.
- I know, I know. I'm thinking about me.

202
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,946
Ethan. Look, it's over.

203
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,866
You know, we might as well
be honest with each other.

204
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,118
Just tell me.

205
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,787
Did you sleep with her?

206
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,123
Just say it.

207
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,918
What's the difference at this point,
right? I mean, why torture me?

208
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,338
Just put me out of my misery.

209
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:44,301
- What are we doing here--?
- Okay.

210
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:53,310
Yes, okay? I slept with her.
Are you happy?

211
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:57,564
I've been sleeping with her.
She's in love with me. She's young.

212
00:14:57,731 --> 00:15:00,567
Look, this is not a proud moment
for me.

213
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,611
I mean, you should just know that.

214
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,074
Amanda!

215
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:15,999
Did you say, am I happy?

216
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,586
I didn't mean that. You get me nuts
sometimes, I say things I don't mean.

217
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,505
In the world of love, Ethan...

218
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,507
... not that I'm such a genius at it...

219
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,676
... but in the world of love,
cheating is not acceptable.

220
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,220
No matter what you think--

221
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:32,265
I know you have a very high opinion
of yourself, but this isn't all me.

222
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,018
- Okay.
- So when you're not in such a rage...

223
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,604
- ... I think you'll see that too.
- Yeah, maybe.

224
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:41,441
Maybe when I stop having visions
of you two together...

225
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,360
... I will see your side.

226
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:49,282
You gotta be--

227
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,001
Punched him in the face.

228
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,841
- Is this a bad time?
- No, no, I'm just--

229
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,218
- I'm just flipping out a little bit.
- Oh, okay.

230
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:11,555
God. Okay-- No. I'm okay.
God, why would this happen?

231
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,890
No. You know what? I'm all right.

232
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,393
Hi.

233
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:18,603
What's up?

234
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,188
Ben needs you.

235
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,066
<i>Rebecca Green was just your
average 20-year-old.</i>

236
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:27,404
<i>Until the father she never knew left
her something she never expected.</i>

237
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:29,364
<i>Don't scream.</i>

238
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,992
<i>-Your father left you something.
- I never met my father.</i>

239
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,828
<i>-Now you know he was interesting.
- Lindsay Lohan.</i>

240
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,122
<i>James Franco.</i>

241
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,251
- Deception.
- <i>You happen to have two guns?</i>

242
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,295
<i>I didn't think one would be enough.</i>

243
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,754
<i>Christmas Day.</i>

244
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,924
Amazing ! It finally looks like a hit.

245
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,926
And that is why they pay you
the big bucks.

246
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:52,762
I think we should go back
to the original cut on the end.

247
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,556
- It's so much stronger.
- I agree.

248
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:57,058
And make "Christmas Day"
twice as big...

249
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:00,770
... but try it in a red. Like a happy red,
not like a Scorsese red.

250
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,397
Happy red.

251
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,526
Okay, so we're done.

252
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,112
- Great.
- All right.

253
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,908
Hey, you know, let's just take off
for a few weeks.

254
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,410
- Yeah.
- What do you mean? I'm not kidding.

255
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:18,455
You always say that
this is our busiest time.

256
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:20,665
I need to get out of town.

257
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,251
You know? I think I need
some peace and quiet...

258
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:26,129
...or whatever it is people
go away for.

259
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,173
You know what I really wanna do?

260
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,634
I wanna eat carbs without
wanting to kill myself.

261
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,139
I wanna read a book.
Not just a magazine. An actual book.

262
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:40,435
For years, I read these reviews,
I buy the books, but I never read them.

263
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:43,480
Did you read that article in
<i>The New York Times</i> last Sunday?

264
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,691
Severe stress makes women
age prematurely...

265
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,319
... because stress causes DNA
in our cells to shrink...

266
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,196
... until they can no longer replicate.

267
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,323
So when we're stressed,
we look haggard.

268
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,660
- This is just women, not men.
- I'm sorry.

269
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:57,953
They used to say that...

270
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,331
...single women over 35 were
more likely to be killed by a terrorist...

271
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,333
...than to get married.
That was horrible.

272
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,461
But now our generation
is also not getting married.

273
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:09,923
And bonus, real terrorists
actually became part of our lives.

274
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,677
So the stress of it all shows up on our
faces, making us look haggard.

275
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,096
While Ethan goes on
looking cute forever...

276
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:19,015
... <i>...shtupping</i> his
24-year-old receptionist!

277
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:21,268
Oh, my God!

278
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,019
See what I mean?

279
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,730
I need a vacation.

280
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,692
Okay, where do I wanna go?

281
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:32,612
By myself at Christmas.

282
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,241
By myself depressed at Christmas.

283
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,120
All alone on vacation.

284
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:44,708
Alone, alone.

285
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,335
Totally alone.

286
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:05,270
Please, just give me one.

287
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:06,730
One tear.

288
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:17,657
Okay. Moving on.

289
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,494
"Worry-Free Vacations."

290
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,580
Good. Where's that?

291
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,582
Bora Bora.

292
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,252
"Kayak for one?" No, thank you.

293
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,922
"Vacation Rentals." I could do that.

294
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,176
Hole up in a house somewhere.
Disappear for a few weeks.

295
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:37,802
I like that idea.

296
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,430
"Where do you wanna go
on your next vacation?"

297
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,182
"Click here and pick a country."

298
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,601
Where do they speak English?

299
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,229
"Click on a town or city."

300
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,273
Let's see. Cotswolds.

301
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:54,110
"Barn converted to modern house
in the beautiful Cotswolds."

302
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,572
Which looks exactly like the Valley.

303
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,450
Surrey. "Christmas in the country."

304
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:04,704
"A fairy-tale English cottage
set in a tranquil country garden.

305
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:09,542
Snuggle up by an old stone fireplace
and enjoy a cup of cocoa.

306
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:13,797
An enchanting oasis of tranquility
in a quiet English hamlet...

307
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,133
...just 40 minutes
from exciting London."

308
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,095
Yeah.

309
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,184
What am I doing?

310
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,567
Low point.

311
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,861
Low point.

312
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:29,539
"I'm interested... Renting your house.

313
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,335
I'm wondering if your house
is available this Christmas.

314
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:39,215
Because if it is,
you could be a real lifesaver."

315
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,180
"I know it's late to be asking...

316
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,558
... but if you're at all interested,
please contact me."

317
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:58,735
"I'm very interested, but the cottage
is only available for home exchange."

318
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,236
"Home exchange"? What is that?

319
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,531
"We switch houses, cars,
everything.

320
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,992
I haven't done it before,
but friends have."

321
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,037
Where are you?

322
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,500
Please say somewhere far away.

323
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,378
"L.A."

324
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:22,675
Never been there.
Always wanted to go.

325
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,094
I'm Iris, by the way.

326
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:27,931
I'm very normal.

327
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:33,311
Neat freak. Healthy. Non-smoker.

328
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:35,355
Single.

329
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:39,901
Hate my horrible life.

330
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:42,278
I'm Amanda.

331
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,614
Loner, loser and complicated wreck.

332
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,574
Hi.

333
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,576
Hi.

334
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:53,623
I must say...

335
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,459
...your house looks idyllic.

336
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:59,462
"Just what I need." Really?

337
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,882
What does your place look like?

338
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,719
My place is nice,
but it's a little bigger than yours.

339
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,905
"Are there any men in your town?"

340
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,201
Honestly?

341
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,104
"Tomorrow's perfect."

342
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:08,615
Okay. We are on for two weeks...

343
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,199
...starting tomorrow.

344
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:24,047
Hi.

345
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,550
- Hi.
- How are you?

346
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:31,971
- Fine.
- Honey, we're sitting there.

347
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:35,558
Sorry.

348
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,065
Oh, yes. There it is.

349
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,151
- Well, hello, dear.
- Hello.

350
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:46,861
Excuse me.

351
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:49,405
There we go.

352
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:51,949
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, it's okay.

353
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,826
- Did you step on her foot?
- It's okay.

354
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,578
Oh, dear. Clumsy me.

355
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:29,422
<i>Amanda Woods is proud to present</i>
Her Life.

356
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,632
- <i>She had it all:</i>
- Yes, that's it.

357
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,843
<i>The job. The house.</i>

358
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:35,845
<i>The guy.</i>

359
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,430
<i>This holiday season...</i>

360
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:42,018
<i>...find out
what Amanda doesn't have.</i>

361
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,307
This is amazing, this is amazing!

362
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,060
Oh, look at that.

363
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:55,341
Madam?

364
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:58,553
Madam?

365
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:02,431
- Madam?
- Yeah.

366
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:03,850
- We're here.
- Okay.

367
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:15,695
This can't be it.

368
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,114
No, it's just down that lane.

369
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:21,951
But the thing is, I'll never be able
to turn this around at the other end.

370
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,786
Think you can make it from here?

371
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:26,956
No.

372
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:51,647
Hey. You wouldn't happen to know
where Rosehill Cottage is?

373
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:54,942
Go right at the bridge, and then
just keep going. Way down there.

374
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:17,757
Okay.

375
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:22,803
I'm here!

376
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,031
Holy shit.

377
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:07,515
Oh, my God!

378
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:53,394
Okay, that'll be interesting.

379
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:03,988
Get in the-- Get in there. Okay.

380
00:31:04,155 --> 00:31:05,781
Cute dress.

381
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,285
Oh, suitcase.

382
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:17,793
Okay.

383
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:21,964
Now what?

384
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:25,801
I can do this.

385
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,679
I can drive
on the wrong side of the road...

386
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:30,389
...and the wrong side of the car.

387
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,641
Just stay focused.

388
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,936
Oh, please do not hit me!

389
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:40,733
Okay, I hate this.

390
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:46,489
Oh, God.

391
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:49,283
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

392
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,209
- Move out of the way!
- Watch it!

393
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,503
Sorry. Stop!

394
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:02,838
Oh, God.

395
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:08,594
I need a drink.

396
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,367
Someone's having a party tonight.

397
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,204
Oh, yeah.

398
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:37,540
<i>-They went to the shops.
- Didn't see anything.</i>

399
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:42,336
<i>Came home,
and had a bit of a kiss and cuddle.</i>

400
00:32:42,503 --> 00:32:43,504
<i>The end.</i>

401
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:46,632
<i>Rebecca Green
was just your average 20-year-old.</i>

402
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,551
<i>Until the father she never knew...</i>

403
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,803
<i>...left her something
she never expected.</i>

404
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,889
<i>-You happen to have two guns?
- I didn't think one would be enough.</i>

405
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:56,225
Deception. <i>Christmas Day.</i>

406
00:32:56,725 --> 00:33:00,980
And that's why they pay me
the big bucks.

407
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:03,983
<i>And now the weather. First,
Northern England and North Wales...</i>

408
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,278
<i>...will have sleet or snow in the
morning and again later in the day.</i>

409
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:56,428
Blinked.

410
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:39,722
Oh, that's intense.

411
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,355
Oh, no. "Gate"?

412
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,739
- Who was he with?
- Maggie.

413
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,241
- The flutes. This is the best part.
- One second.

414
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,577
Hello-- Hello?

415
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:06,248
- <i>Hello? Can you hear me?</i>
- Yeah, it's Miles. Amanda?

416
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:08,917
No, I'm sorry.
Amanda's not here, I'm afraid.

417
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:12,880
<i>I'm trying to figure out
how to open the gate. Oh, fu--</i>

418
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:15,049
Very nice.

419
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:18,093
<i>If you heard that, I'm sorry.</i>

420
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:24,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

421
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:27,019
I'm so sorry.
I'm new at the gate thing.

422
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:28,729
It's okay. It was pretty funny.

423
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:32,232
I'm Miles. I work with Ethan.

424
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,109
Ethan?

425
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:36,737
- Amanda's ex.
- Oh, right.

426
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:38,447
Right.

427
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:40,949
Know when she'll be back?
Supposed to pick up things.

428
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,118
Amanda's in England,
actually, on holiday.

429
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:44,870
I'm staying here while she's away.

430
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,458
- You okay?
- Yes.

431
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,585
Yeah, something just
blew into my eye.

432
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:53,962
Oh, I hate that. Let me see.

433
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:57,466
Yep, you got something in
your eyelash. You want me to get it?

434
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,928
- Okay.
- Okay.

435
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:03,472
- Yeah, Santa Anas.
- Pardon?

436
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:06,100
The wind. It's what makes
it so warm this time of year.

437
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:09,144
Legend has it,
when the Santa Anas blow...

438
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:11,313
...all bets are off.
Anything can happen.

439
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,067
That's it. You okay?

440
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,821
Better. Thank you.

441
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,327
So you needed to...?

442
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:27,121
Pick up Ethan's laptop.

443
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,623
And you're his...?

444
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,251
Oh, well, I'm a film composer, too,
like Ethan, but--

445
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:35,129
- Did you compose this? It's beautiful.
- This?

446
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:36,922
Yes, I did. I wrote this.

447
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:39,425
No, I didn't. I wish I did.

448
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,761
This is the great Ennio Morricone.

449
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,763
Would you mind
coming back tomorrow?

450
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,182
I just want to check this
with Amanda's assistant.

451
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:48,350
Sure.

452
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,477
- I'm Iris, by the way.
- Miles.

453
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:53,105
- Right.
- And this is my Maggie.

454
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:57,317
I mean, just Maggie.
Not "my" Maggie.

455
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,361
- Hello.
- Hey.

456
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,029
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

457
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,865
Okay.

458
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,201
Don't blow away.

459
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:08,370
I won't.

460
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:44,698
Anything can happen.

461
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:56,627
Five, six, seven, eight, nine,
10, 11, 12. One a.m. in London.

462
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:41,797
Who is it?

463
00:39:41,964 --> 00:39:44,216
It's me. Hurry up. It's freezing.

464
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,219
- Who are you?
- Iris, open the door...

465
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:49,972
...or I swear I'm gonna take a leak
all over your--

466
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,894
You're not Iris.

467
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:59,231
Or if you are,
I'm much drunker than I realized.

468
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:01,233
I'm sorry for my profanity.

469
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,111
I wasn't expecting you.

470
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:07,906
Well, I wasn't expecting you either.

471
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,450
Nevertheless, may I just--?

472
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:15,205
Yeah. Of course. Sure.
You had to-- Yeah.

473
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:18,500
I'm Graham. Iris' brother.

474
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:20,711
Brother.

475
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,838
I'm Amanda Woods.
I'm staying here.

476
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:25,007
Amandawoods?
Is that all one word?

477
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:28,010
No. No, it's not.

478
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,804
<i>Brother? Oh, my God.</i>

479
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,352
So Iris is-- Where is--?
Where is she?

480
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,854
She didn't tell you?

481
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:42,190
She could have done...

482
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:46,153
... but as previously stated...

483
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,865
... I'm-- I've just-- I've been...

484
00:40:50,032 --> 00:40:52,367
She's in Los Angeles.

485
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:55,871
That's not possible.
Iris never goes anywhere.

486
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:58,165
Well, we have that in common.

487
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:02,169
No, she listed this cottage on a
home-exchange website and I found it.

488
00:41:02,336 --> 00:41:05,380
We switched houses for two weeks.
For the holiday.

489
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:09,343
She's in L.A. at my house
and I'm here.

490
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:12,054
- People actually do that?
- Apparently.

491
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,724
Yeah. I mean, it seems.
Here I am in my pajamas.

492
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:19,436
She did ring me last night. I didn't
get a chance to get back to her.

493
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:21,521
I feel awful now.

494
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,568
Would you mind if I sat?
I feel like I might bump into you.

495
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:29,029
Sure. Yeah. Sit.

496
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:35,911
You okay?

497
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:38,372
Yeah, I'm good.

498
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:41,333
Look, I'm sorry about the intrusion.

499
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:45,128
Although I may not appear it,
I am in fact Iris'...

500
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,673
...semi-respectable big brother.

501
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:51,468
But on the rare--
Or lately not-so-rare occasion...

502
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:54,054
...that I frequent the local pub...

503
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:57,599
...and get inordinately pissed,
my little sister puts me up...

504
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:59,601
...so I don't get behind the wheel.

505
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:04,898
Pathetic explanation, but unfortunately
it's become a bit of a routine.

506
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:08,485
So how's it going so far?

507
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:11,238
I mean, up until I showed up
and ruined your night.

508
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:14,866
Well, it's not going so great.

509
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,035
Yeah, I'm leaving tomorrow
on a noon plane.

510
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,746
When did you get here?

511
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,375
About six hours ago.

512
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:26,128
We've made a great impression
on you, haven't we?

513
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,088
No, it's not that. It's just that...

514
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:30,465
You know,
I'm not quite myself right now.

515
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:32,342
I came here on a stupid whim.

516
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:35,887
Honestly, I've never thought about
anything less. It's very unlike me.

517
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,807
Would you like something to drink?

518
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:41,893
Glass of water? Tea?

519
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,061
Wine, maybe?

520
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:47,983
I think there's a bottle of brandy.
Fancy a glass?

521
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:51,236
- Sure.
- Good.

522
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:56,992
So... I'm sorry, I've totally blanked
and forgotten your name.

523
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,493
Amanda.

524
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,162
So, Amanda...

525
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,705
...you're not married, are you?

526
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:04,499
Why? Do I look not married?

527
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:08,962
No. It was just a backwards way
of asking if you were married.

528
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:11,006
No, not at all.

529
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:14,843
I don't know what that means.

530
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:17,679
I mean, no, I'm not married.

531
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:21,266
Me neither.

532
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:26,855
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

533
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:36,948
So is it horrible if I stay?

534
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,034
I'll be gone
before you even wake up.

535
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:41,536
I promise you will never
lay eyes on me again.

536
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,708
Of-- No, that's fine. Sure.

537
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:49,211
- Thank you.
- Let me just get you a blanket.

538
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,713
In the cupboard,
on top of the Scrabble.

539
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:59,304
So why is it you aren't
quite yourself at the moment?

540
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:03,975
Well, I just broke up with someone.

541
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,519
Yesterday.

542
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:07,354
And I guess
what I was feeling...

543
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:09,898
...was that I didn't wanna be alone
over the holidays.

544
00:44:10,065 --> 00:44:11,900
I thought that
if I was somewhere else...

545
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:13,568
... I wouldn't realize I was alone.

546
00:44:13,735 --> 00:44:16,071
Then I got here
and never felt more alone in my life.

547
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:18,073
Big surprise.

548
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,075
Bet you're glad you knocked
on this door.

549
00:44:20,242 --> 00:44:22,369
I am, actually.

550
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,082
Yeah, well...

551
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:31,670
Sorry and good night.

552
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:33,505
Sweet dreams.

553
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:42,055
Do you think you could...?

554
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,641
Would you mind...

555
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:46,726
...trying that again?

556
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,283
Bad?

557
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:04,744
Weird.

558
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,457
Kissing a total stranger.

559
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,460
Really? I do it all the time.

560
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:16,756
Let me try this.

561
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,644
Maybe if I closed my eyes.

562
00:45:47,621 --> 00:45:51,249
You know, given that
I'm in a bit of a personal crisis...

563
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:55,128
...and I find myself
in a total stranger's home...

564
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:58,006
... in a town that I can't
actually remember the name of...

565
00:45:58,173 --> 00:46:00,508
...and considering
that you showed up...

566
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:03,803
...and you're, like,
insanely good-looking...

567
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:07,307
...and really drunk and probably
won't remember me anyway...

568
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:10,977
... I'm thinking...

569
00:46:11,144 --> 00:46:13,104
...we should have sex.

570
00:46:13,939 --> 00:46:15,357
If you want.

571
00:46:16,942 --> 00:46:18,526
Is that a trick question?

572
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:22,030
I'm actually serious.

573
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:26,326
And not that it matters, but I've never
said anything like that in my entire life.

574
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:28,119
It's just that this whole...

575
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:32,207
... knowing-I'll-never-see-you-again
thing is kind of exciting.

576
00:46:32,374 --> 00:46:34,501
I mean, this is what a vacation's
supposed to be.

577
00:46:34,668 --> 00:46:37,671
You're supposed to vacate life,
do the unexpected. And you are...

578
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,882
...definitely unexpected.

579
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:43,677
This all sounded wonderful
till I became the cabana boy.

580
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,638
And you're funny,
which is, like, a bonus.

581
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:48,556
Yeah? Never meet me
when I'm sober.

582
00:46:48,974 --> 00:46:50,558
Deal.

583
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:57,899
Oh, also, I should warn you.

584
00:46:58,525 --> 00:47:01,069
I'm not very good at this.

585
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:02,821
"This" being...?

586
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:06,700
- Sex.
- Okay. Now, that cannot be true.

587
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:10,203
Nevertheless, the guy that I lived with
mentioned it once or twice...

588
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:14,040
...and a girl does not forget
a comment like that. Not even me.

589
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:26,386
I mean, how bad could I be?

590
00:47:26,553 --> 00:47:30,890
Sex is pretty basic, right? Am I
pretty much talking you out of this?

591
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,809
Strangely, not at all.

592
00:47:32,976 --> 00:47:35,103
How do you feel about foreplay?

593
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:37,772
I think it's overrated.

594
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:41,192
Significantly overrated.

595
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:46,448
You are quickly becoming one of
the most interesting girls I've ever met.

596
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:58,376
Look at you.

597
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:01,588
You're already better than you think.

598
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:18,813
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

599
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:22,942
I lost my contacts
last night somehow.

600
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:28,615
- Much better.
- Yeah.

601
00:48:29,491 --> 00:48:30,617
Can I help you with that?

602
00:48:31,034 --> 00:48:33,453
I should know how to do this.

603
00:48:37,499 --> 00:48:41,336
You're supposed to
plug them in over here. Right.

604
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:52,472
- So, Amanda, I just really--
- Yeah. You know...

605
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:56,017
... listen, you don't have to worry
about a thing here. Okay?

606
00:48:57,977 --> 00:48:59,020
Okay.

607
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:03,149
I mean, it was great
meeting you and everything.

608
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:09,364
Definitely. Also, for the record,
your ex-boyfriend is, in my opinion...

609
00:49:09,531 --> 00:49:12,033
...extremely mistaken about you.

610
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:13,827
Well, yeah, you were drunk.

611
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:16,871
- Not that drunk.
- Yeah.

612
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,332
Oh, that's mine.

613
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:22,669
Sophie. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to look.

614
00:49:23,545 --> 00:49:25,046
I'll call her back.

615
00:49:30,218 --> 00:49:32,262
Coffee cups.

616
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:37,350
- Here.
- Thank you.

617
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,561
You don't want one?

618
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:42,480
I should probably be going.

619
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:48,903
Oh, yeah. You know, I gotta get going
in a few minutes myself.

620
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,698
So listen.

621
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:54,492
I know you're leaving
and absolutely not interested...

622
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:57,579
... in getting involved,
but just so you know...

623
00:49:57,745 --> 00:50:00,832
...things in my life
are a little bit complicated...

624
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:03,334
...and even if you were staying,
I can promise you...

625
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,171
- ...you wouldn't--
- You really don't have to do this.

626
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:09,799
Look, I'm sort of a mess
in this area myself.

627
00:50:09,966 --> 00:50:13,928
And anyway, I mean,
honestly, we hardly know each other.

628
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:16,431
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that...

629
00:50:16,598 --> 00:50:20,894
... but I just want to assure you,
you're better off. I'm--

630
00:50:21,603 --> 00:50:22,604
- I'm--
- Okay.

631
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:26,941
No need to go on. Right.

632
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:31,112
Well, I just want to be sure
you are okay because somehow...

633
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:36,367
... I find I tend to hurt women
simply by being myself, so...

634
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:39,579
I'm not going
to fall in love with you, I promise.

635
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:42,707
Okay. Nicely put. Thank you.

636
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:47,295
No, it's just that I know myself.
I'm not sure I even fall in love.

637
00:50:47,462 --> 00:50:49,631
Not like the way other people do.

638
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,133
How's that for something to admit?

639
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:56,471
Well, like I said,
Most Interesting Girl Award.

640
00:50:57,847 --> 00:51:00,642
I'm gonna try to see that
as a compliment.

641
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:03,978
You should. Absolutely.

642
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:09,025
Right.

643
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,279
Okay, then. Well...

644
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:16,491
Utter honesty. Very refreshing.

645
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:20,286
Well, you probably
won't be hearing from me...

646
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:23,039
... because even if you wanted to,
and you clearly don't...

647
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:26,292
... I have the classic
male problem of no follow-through.

648
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:29,504
Absolutely never remember
to call after a date.

649
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:36,177
But since this wasn't a date
I guess I'm off the hook.

650
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:38,429
Exactly.

651
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:43,977
But what if I wanted to call you?

652
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:50,358
Right. Sorry. Apparently not
the right thing to say at all.

653
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:54,195
Well, if your flight's canceled
or for some reason...

654
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:57,365
...you change your mind, I'm having
dinner with some friends...

655
00:51:57,532 --> 00:51:58,700
...at the pub tonight.

656
00:52:01,202 --> 00:52:02,662
And...

657
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:08,334
... if not, then, well...

658
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:11,713
...you're lovely.

659
00:52:16,509 --> 00:52:18,386
So are you.

660
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:32,442
<i>Attention, passengers,
this is the final boarding call...</i>

661
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:35,737
<i>...for British Airways flight 42.</i>

662
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:44,579
<i>Amanda wasn't looking for love...</i>

663
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:49,584
<i>...but that doesn't mean
it didn't find her.</i>

664
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:51,210
Well, ma'am, you're good to go.

665
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:54,130
Thank you.

666
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:23,785
Thank you, Amanda.

667
00:53:45,348 --> 00:53:46,641
Hello?

668
00:53:46,808 --> 00:53:47,975
<i>Where am I finding you?</i>

669
00:53:50,812 --> 00:53:51,979
Jasper.

670
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:54,482
<i>Is it okay that I'm calling you?</i>

671
00:53:56,943 --> 00:53:58,861
I suppose so.

672
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,321
How are you?

673
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:03,074
<i>Could we start
with a less complicated question?</i>

674
00:54:04,784 --> 00:54:05,993
What's wrong?

675
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,498
<i>I'm having some real problems
with a section of my book.</i>

676
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:13,000
<i>I can use some Iris.</i>

677
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:16,170
<i>Would it be awful
if I sent you some pages?</i>

678
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:19,006
<i>Just tell me if it is.
I don't wanna mess you up. I'll--</i>

679
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:22,218
<i>I know that you're the only one
who can really help me.</i>

680
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:25,596
No. Well-- I mean...

681
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:28,975
... if you need me.

682
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:31,769
<i>Well, you know
you are my little survival kit.</i>

683
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:37,817
<i>So, Simpkey, have you put on
that little red bikini yet?</i>

684
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:40,862
<i>You know,
the one that unties at the back?</i>

685
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:43,573
How do you remember
my little red bikini?

686
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:46,784
<i>I remember everything.</i>

687
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:48,661
Do you?

688
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:53,082
You know, just the other day,
I was just thinking about that time--

689
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:55,376
<i>Darling, I've just arrived
at Soho House.</i>

690
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:57,545
<i>I'm meeting some friends for drinks.</i>

691
00:54:57,712 --> 00:55:00,298
- Okay.
- <i>You keep the change.</i>

692
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:02,091
<i>Bloody cold in here.</i>

693
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:04,051
<i>Okay, I'm sending you
the pages tomorrow.</i>

694
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:08,264
<i>Look for them, will you?
And have some fun today, okay?</i>

695
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,058
Okay.

696
00:55:29,577 --> 00:55:30,995
Graham?

697
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:04,278
Oh, no, is he lost?

698
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:19,460
Excuse me.

699
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:24,173
Hello. Can I offer you a lift home?

700
00:56:24,674 --> 00:56:27,051
Why? You know where I live?

701
00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:29,303
I believe I do, yes.

702
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:32,139
Good. Then that makes one of us.

703
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,228
Your house is lovely.

704
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:39,689
I've lived here 47 years.

705
00:56:39,855 --> 00:56:42,984
Back then, there were only
six houses on this block.

706
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,444
Every year,
they tear another one down...

707
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,154
... not that I blame them.

708
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:49,699
They weren't that great
to begin with.

709
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:56,289
But that's how I got confused.
I didn't recognize one house.

710
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:59,333
That would be confusing.

711
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,962
What part of England are you from?

712
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:08,801
- Surrey.
- Cary Grant was from Surrey.

713
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:11,137
That's right, he was.

714
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:14,724
- How did you know that?
- Oh, he told me once.

715
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,977
Well, I thank you very much,
young lady.

716
00:57:21,814 --> 00:57:23,608
Let me help you with that.

717
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:25,985
Okay.

718
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:27,612
I-- Thank you.

719
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:30,364
There you go.

720
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:32,992
Well, this was some meet-cute.

721
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:36,037
- Sorry?
- It's how two characters meet...

722
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:37,580
... in a movie.

723
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:41,042
Say a man and a woman...

724
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:43,711
... both need something to sleep in.

725
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,882
And they both go
to the same men's pajama department.

726
00:57:48,049 --> 00:57:51,177
- Right.
- And the man says to the salesman:

727
00:57:51,344 --> 00:57:54,889
"I just need bottoms."
The woman says, "I just need a top."

728
00:57:55,514 --> 00:57:59,310
They look at each other,
and that's the "meet-cute."

729
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:01,395
Oh, I see.

730
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:04,398
Of course, this isn't
quite that cute, but...

731
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:08,944
So you're in the film business?

732
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:12,782
Was. Yes, yes, I was.

733
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:15,451
I was a writer.

734
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,502
I could be here till tomorrow.

735
00:58:24,669 --> 00:58:26,420
Oh, here.

736
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:28,547
Let me.

737
00:58:34,804 --> 00:58:36,514
Thank you.

738
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:09,755
Oh, my God.

739
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:28,315
Well, goodbye, then.

740
00:59:29,525 --> 00:59:32,111
I enjoyed our meet-cute.

741
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:34,321
Well, thank you.
Thank you for rescuing me.

742
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:38,284
It's a pleasure. Absolutely.

743
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:48,169
You know, I hope you
don't find this strange...

744
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:51,714
... but I've just arrived here,
and, well, I don't really know anyone.

745
00:59:51,881 --> 00:59:54,842
And I was thinking of going out
for dinner tonight.

746
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:57,803
Well, if you're not busy,
would you like to join me?

747
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:03,642
Busy? Honey,
I haven't been busy since 1978.

748
01:00:06,854 --> 01:00:09,732
I learned everything
working in this place.

749
01:00:09,899 --> 01:00:12,193
- Best job I ever had.
- Wait, wait, wait.

750
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:14,570
That was your first job
in Hollywood?

751
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:16,781
Louis B. Mayer's office boy?

752
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:21,535
Actually, my first job
was as a Western Union messenger.

753
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:27,082
That's how I met Mayer. I delivered
a telegram to his office at MGM.

754
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:30,878
When I walked in, all the girls
in the office were in a tizzy.

755
01:00:31,045 --> 01:00:33,047
Their office boy didn't show up.

756
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:38,385
I volunteered for the job.
The next day, I was on the payroll.

757
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:41,138
I was 17 years old.

758
01:00:42,348 --> 01:00:46,227
So was Hollywood really as great
back then as I imagine?

759
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:47,645
It was better.

760
01:00:51,232 --> 01:00:53,651
You know what I've been
asking myself all night?

761
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:58,239
What? Why I'm bothering you
with all these questions?

762
01:00:58,405 --> 01:01:01,242
I'm wondering
why a beautiful girl like you...

763
01:01:01,909 --> 01:01:05,371
...would go to a stranger's house
for her Christmas vacation...

764
01:01:05,538 --> 01:01:09,208
...and on top of that, spend Saturday
night with an old cooker like me.

765
01:01:09,917 --> 01:01:11,126
Well, I--

766
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:15,089
I just wanted to get away
from the people I see all the time.

767
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:22,054
Well, not all the people.

768
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:24,723
One person.

769
01:01:25,224 --> 01:01:30,020
I wanted to get away from one guy.

770
01:01:30,855 --> 01:01:36,443
An ex-boyfriend who just got engaged
and forgot to tell me.

771
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,946
- Sorry.
- So he's a schmuck.

772
01:01:39,113 --> 01:01:43,742
As a matter of fact, he is.
A huge schmuck.

773
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:46,704
- How did you know?
- He let you go.

774
01:01:46,871 --> 01:01:48,747
This is not a hard one to figure out.

775
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:53,168
Iris, in the movies
we have leading ladies...

776
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:54,962
...and we have the best friend.

777
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:58,007
You, I can tell, are a leading lady.

778
01:01:58,173 --> 01:02:01,218
But for some reason,
you're behaving like the best friend.

779
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:04,054
You're so right.

780
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:08,434
You're supposed to be the leading
lady of your own life, for God's sake.

781
01:02:09,977 --> 01:02:14,398
Arthur, I've been going
to a therapist for three years.

782
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:18,277
And she's never explained
anything to me that well.

783
01:02:19,737 --> 01:02:21,614
That was brilliant.

784
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:24,658
Brutal, but brilliant.

785
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:26,785
Thank you.

786
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:40,299
I haven't had that much to drink in--

787
01:02:40,466 --> 01:02:42,509
What am I saying?

788
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:47,014
- I've never had that much to drink.
- Yes, I believe no one ever has.

789
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:51,477
Okay, the last thing I remember
was coming in here last night and--

790
01:02:56,148 --> 01:02:59,526
- I had nothing to do with that.
- Oh, I know, but you were here.

791
01:02:59,693 --> 01:03:04,114
- I was.
- Oh, God. So I guess we...

792
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:07,201
Did we...? I mean, did we...?

793
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:10,955
- We didn't?
- We did not.

794
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:12,957
Oh, thank God.

795
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:17,670
I mean, not "thank God,"
but just thank God.

796
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:20,673
Because I didn't remember...

797
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:23,884
So why didn't we...?
Just remind me a little.

798
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,345
Call me old-fashioned...

799
01:03:26,512 --> 01:03:29,723
... but one doesn't have sex
with women who are unconscious.

800
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:32,351
Unconscious? Oh, God.

801
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:35,729
That must have been
really attractive.

802
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:37,731
Why did you stay?

803
01:03:38,399 --> 01:03:39,733
Because you asked me to.

804
01:03:41,068 --> 01:03:42,569
I did, didn't I?

805
01:03:45,406 --> 01:03:48,492
Did I beg at one point?

806
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:55,374
From the moment I met you,
it's been an adventure.

807
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:57,793
Oh, yes.

808
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:02,339
And I am deeply sorry about that.
I have nothing to say for myself...

809
01:04:02,506 --> 01:04:06,927
...other than I must be
temporarily nuts right now.

810
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:11,598
Olivia. Sorry, I didn't mean to look.

811
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:14,935
- Again.
- I should probably take this.

812
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:18,439
Hello. Hi.

813
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:36,123
I can't. I can't today.

814
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:42,004
Sophie, Olivia, Amanda.

815
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:44,631
Busy guy.

816
01:04:57,311 --> 01:05:00,314
- I think we should go into town.
- What do you mean?

817
01:05:00,481 --> 01:05:02,191
I think you should get dressed.

818
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:06,487
We should take a drive, get some
lunch and get to know each other.

819
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,281
Really? Why?

820
01:05:09,448 --> 01:05:12,659
Because I'm running out of reasons
why we shouldn't.

821
01:05:12,826 --> 01:05:14,411
Aren't you?

822
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:47,986
- So you're a book editor.
- Yes, I am.

823
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:51,365
- What kind of an editor are you?
- A very mean one.

824
01:05:51,532 --> 01:05:54,701
No. What I meant was,
do you give massive notes, or...?

825
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:56,537
The better the writer,
the less notes.

826
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:59,665
- And what'd you study in school?
- Literature.

827
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:02,334
And did you always know
this was what you wanted to do?

828
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:05,212
Okay, my palms
are starting to sweat.

829
01:06:05,379 --> 01:06:07,214
I feel like I'm on a job interview.

830
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:09,883
Do you, by any chance,
know how to be on a date?

831
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:12,553
- Sorry. I'm interrogating you.
- Yes.

832
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:16,640
I haven't been on a first date
in a long time.

833
01:06:17,558 --> 01:06:20,853
Well, since we've already had sex
and slept together twice...

834
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:23,313
... maybe we can bend
the first-date rules.

835
01:06:23,814 --> 01:06:25,149
Why are you blushing?

836
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:28,569
I didn't realize I was.
I think you make me nervous.

837
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:34,366
Okay. I'm gonna try to be myself.
It's never easy, but I'm gonna try.

838
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:37,786
What was the question? Oh, I know.

839
01:06:37,953 --> 01:06:40,539
- Did I always want to be a book editor?
- Did you--? Right.

840
01:06:40,706 --> 01:06:42,749
The answer is yes.
My family's in publishing.

841
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,751
My dad's a writer
of historical fiction.

842
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:46,378
My mum was--

843
01:06:46,545 --> 01:06:50,048
Is, to this day, a very important editor
at Random House.

844
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:53,927
Okay. I believe my time is up.
Your turn.

845
01:06:54,094 --> 01:06:55,679
Really?

846
01:06:55,846 --> 01:06:57,306
- Deep breath.
- Okay.

847
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,559
- All right?
- Yeah.

848
01:07:01,018 --> 01:07:02,603
Well, like I said the other night...

849
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:05,230
... I own a company
that does movie advertising.

850
01:07:05,397 --> 01:07:07,149
I didn't realize
you own the company.

851
01:07:07,316 --> 01:07:09,026
Probably because
I didn't mention it.

852
01:07:09,193 --> 01:07:12,279
But now that I know you were raised
by such a strong working mom...

853
01:07:12,446 --> 01:07:14,865
... I can say it,
and maybe you won't be intimidated.

854
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:17,201
No, no.
I'm still a little intimidated by it.

855
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,703
Well, "a little"
is way ahead of the curve.

856
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:24,124
- Yeah.
- What about your family?

857
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:27,211
Okay, I'll say it fast.

858
01:07:28,337 --> 01:07:30,547
My parents broke up when I was 15.

859
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:35,177
I'm an only child, and I--
I didn't see it coming.

860
01:07:35,344 --> 01:07:36,762
You know, we were really close.

861
01:07:36,929 --> 01:07:40,307
We used to call ourselves
"The Three Musketeers."

862
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:44,102
And one night after dinner,
my parents sat me down...

863
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:46,855
...and told me that
they were breaking up.

864
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:49,399
I thought they were kidding.

865
01:07:50,317 --> 01:07:54,863
And then I saw a suitcase out of
the corner of my eye in the hallway.

866
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:57,950
And my dad moved out that night.

867
01:07:59,868 --> 01:08:03,455
I think I cried myself to sleep
for, like, well...

868
01:08:03,622 --> 01:08:06,250
Anyway, a long time.

869
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:10,587
And then I realized
that I'd better toughen up.

870
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:16,009
And, well, I got through it
and sort of haven't cried since.

871
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:20,138
I also haven't thought of
that packed suitcase maybe ever.

872
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:23,267
And that's my tragic little story.

873
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:25,852
- Let's order.
- Wait.

874
01:08:26,019 --> 01:08:27,604
You haven't cried
since you were 15?

875
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:31,692
I know it must mean something awful.
I know, but...

876
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:35,195
You know, I try, but-- Believe me.

877
01:08:35,362 --> 01:08:38,407
But can we talk about you
some more, please?

878
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:42,411
Okay. Yes. Absolutely. Okay.
Well, I cry all the time.

879
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:44,746
- You do not.
- Yeah, I do.

880
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:46,707
More than any woman
you've ever met.

881
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:48,792
You don't have to be this nice.

882
01:08:49,501 --> 01:08:51,211
- It happens to be the truth.
- Really?

883
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:55,674
A good book, a great film,
a birthday card, I weep.

884
01:08:55,841 --> 01:08:58,218
- Shut up.
- I'm a major weeper.

885
01:08:58,385 --> 01:08:59,553
I am.

886
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:58,945
- This was such a great afternoon.
- It was a really great afternoon.

887
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:02,991
You know, you don't have
to walk me in. It's freezing, and...

888
01:10:03,742 --> 01:10:05,744
You can just say
you don't want me to come in.

889
01:10:05,911 --> 01:10:08,497
No, it's not that. I just-- No--

890
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:11,917
I'm just tired.
I think I'm gonna take a nap.

891
01:10:12,084 --> 01:10:14,461
- It's not that.
- Okay, I'll pretend I believe you.

892
01:10:15,504 --> 01:10:19,132
Graham, I'm leaving in nine days.

893
01:10:19,299 --> 01:10:21,885
And that makes this complicated.

894
01:10:22,052 --> 01:10:25,263
And I'm not sure I can handle
complicated right now.

895
01:10:28,934 --> 01:10:30,519
Okay.

896
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:44,825
And that doesn't make things
complicated?

897
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:47,744
Sex makes everything complicated.

898
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:51,957
Even when you don't have it, the not
having it makes things complicated.

899
01:10:52,124 --> 01:10:55,836
Which is why it's usually better
to have it. Some say.

900
01:11:01,133 --> 01:11:03,468
Well, I'm off to work in the morning.

901
01:11:03,635 --> 01:11:07,013
I promise I won't be drunkenly
banging on your door any time soon.

902
01:11:08,056 --> 01:11:11,017
We'll see each other, okay?
We'll figure something out.

903
01:11:11,518 --> 01:11:13,520
- Good.
- Good.

904
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:24,823
Oh, it's freezing.

905
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:46,470
- Hi.
- Hello.

906
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:49,222
- Bad timing?
- No, no. Come in.

907
01:11:49,890 --> 01:11:52,559
- How's it going?
- Good. Yeah, everything's good.

908
01:11:52,726 --> 01:11:54,269
This FedEx was leaning
on the gate.

909
01:11:54,436 --> 01:11:57,230
From a little town
called London, England.

910
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:03,904
Friend of mine's writing a book,
and I give him...

911
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:08,325
... notes sometimes.

912
01:12:10,744 --> 01:12:14,498
- You have company?
- I'm having a little Hanukkah party.

913
01:12:15,457 --> 01:12:17,417
Did you join a temple
since I last saw you?

914
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:20,879
No. My neighbor knew
I didn't know anyone here.

915
01:12:21,046 --> 01:12:23,548
So he wanted to introduce me
to some of his friends.

916
01:12:23,715 --> 01:12:26,218
And somehow it turned into
a Hanukkah thing.

917
01:12:26,635 --> 01:12:28,261
Do you wanna come in for a sec?

918
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:32,182
All right. Yeah.
I could play spin the dreidel.

919
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:33,934
Smells good.

920
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:37,437
I just have to say, this is one of
the best Hanukkahs I've ever had.

921
01:12:37,604 --> 01:12:38,939
Hear, hear.

922
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:42,609
I've had too much of the Manischewitz.
I'm gonna have to be cut off.

923
01:12:42,776 --> 01:12:45,445
We are cutting you off.

924
01:12:45,612 --> 01:12:48,365
I take this very seriously,
and I'm telling you the truth.

925
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:50,575
He amazes me.

926
01:12:50,742 --> 01:12:52,494
Don't listen to them. They're nuts.

927
01:12:52,661 --> 01:12:56,498
Okay, so you're telling me
you were not a ladies' man?

928
01:12:56,665 --> 01:12:59,209
Never. I married very young.

929
01:12:59,376 --> 01:13:01,628
Yes, only because
he had the greatest girl in town.

930
01:13:01,795 --> 01:13:03,755
He had to take her off the market.

931
01:13:03,922 --> 01:13:07,425
- That's the truth.
- Everyone loved Marion.

932
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:09,261
She had the greatest laugh.

933
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:12,305
What did he say?
She had the greatest ass?

934
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,100
Greatest laugh.

935
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:18,395
Although her ass
wasn't so bad, either.

936
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:23,567
She had real gumption.
She was the girl I always wrote.

937
01:13:25,485 --> 01:13:28,989
What about you, Miles?
You're a man about town, I presume.

938
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:33,827
No, gents, sadly I am not. I'm just
a one-woman-at-a-time kind of guy.

939
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:39,666
Actually, I've been dating a beautiful
actress for about five months.

940
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:43,628
I do not know what she sees in me,
but I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

941
01:13:44,129 --> 01:13:46,631
Oh, she's an actress?
What's she been in?

942
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:49,759
- Anything we would have seen?
- She hasn't done that much yet, but--

943
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:51,511
And where is she tonight?

944
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:54,639
Look, he's half-dead,
and he's still interested.

945
01:13:54,806 --> 01:13:59,519
Well, I mean, that made me curious.
You know, he's here. Where is she?

946
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:04,441
She's on location in New Mexico.
She's working on a little indie film.

947
01:14:04,608 --> 01:14:08,445
Sorry she couldn't be here.
She'll be back in about 10 days.

948
01:14:08,612 --> 01:14:10,280
Her loss is our gain.

949
01:14:11,031 --> 01:14:12,866
- Thank you, Arthur.
- Fellas...

950
01:14:13,033 --> 01:14:17,037
... I think we should leave these young
folks and get back to our bedpans.

951
01:14:19,581 --> 01:14:21,708
Okay, Norman,
you are calling me for pinochle.

952
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:24,961
- I got your cell, I'll be in touch.
- Okay, pound right here.

953
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:32,761
This was an amazing night.

954
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:35,847
Arthur Abbott is maybe the last
of the great Hollywood writers...

955
01:14:36,014 --> 01:14:37,432
...from that generation. Thanks.

956
01:14:37,599 --> 01:14:40,560
There are, like, famous things we say
because he wrote them.

957
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:43,897
I know. He told me
that his friends wrote <i>Casablanca...</i>

958
01:14:44,064 --> 01:14:47,901
... but that he added the "kid"
to "Here's looking at you, kid."

959
01:14:48,068 --> 01:14:50,695
Hello! Which totally makes the line.

960
01:14:50,862 --> 01:14:53,698
"Here's looking at you, Ilsa."

961
01:14:53,865 --> 01:14:55,659
Doesn't quite have that ring.

962
01:14:55,825 --> 01:15:00,246
He's so modest. He gave me this long
list of old movies he said I had to see.

963
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:02,040
None were written by him,
of course.

964
01:15:02,207 --> 01:15:04,876
I saw a couple today.
They were fantastic.

965
01:15:05,043 --> 01:15:06,711
Maybe we can see one together.

966
01:15:06,878 --> 01:15:09,923
- That would be great.
- All right, cool.

967
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:11,758
Then I'll definitely call you.

968
01:15:13,927 --> 01:15:17,722
The brisket was great. And those
chocolate-covered macaroons.

969
01:15:17,889 --> 01:15:21,226
Delectable. It was really fun
hanging with you.

970
01:15:21,935 --> 01:15:24,646
Okay. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to kiss you twice...

971
01:15:24,813 --> 01:15:27,023
...and then linger a long time
on the second kiss.

972
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:29,609
- No problem.
- Oh, boy.

973
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:34,447
It is officially crazy weather.

974
01:15:40,078 --> 01:15:41,287
Don't blow away.

975
01:15:59,264 --> 01:16:02,016
"I'm not sure
I can handle complicated"?

976
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:04,394
Oh, God, I can be such a jerk.

977
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:07,814
- <i>Amanda Woods.</i>
- Shut up.

978
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:11,359
<i>She pushed every guy away,
every time.</i>

979
01:16:11,526 --> 01:16:15,447
<i>It's not, "Will she ever change, "
but, "Does she want to?"</i>

980
01:16:53,443 --> 01:16:57,030
- Surprise.
- Yeah, it is. Hi.

981
01:16:57,197 --> 01:17:00,700
Hi. So I was home doing nothing
and thinking of you...

982
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:03,912
...and I realized that a little
complication never hurt anyone.

983
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:07,081
And then I thought,
maybe this isn't so complicated at all.

984
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:09,042
And also, I wanted to apologize.

985
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:11,753
I am sorry I didn't
invite you in this afternoon.

986
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,047
I don't know what that
was about exactly...

987
01:17:14,214 --> 01:17:18,968
... but whatever it was,
I thought that I should just...

988
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:24,015
Oh, my God. You're...
You're not alone, are you?

989
01:17:25,642 --> 01:17:26,893
No, I'm not, actually.

990
01:17:28,353 --> 01:17:30,021
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, no, no. Don't be.

991
01:17:30,188 --> 01:17:32,857
I shouldn't have just...
Oh, man.

992
01:17:33,024 --> 01:17:36,069
Okay, seriously,
do not worry about this.

993
01:17:36,236 --> 01:17:39,364
This is just me, like, being stupid.

994
01:17:41,074 --> 01:17:42,867
Who is it, Daddy?

995
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:47,038
- "Daddy"?
- Yes.

996
01:17:47,205 --> 01:17:49,457
I am Daddy.

997
01:17:51,251 --> 01:17:53,753
Amanda, this is my
daughter Sophie.

998
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,421
Soph, this is my friend Amanda.

999
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:58,174
- Hi.
- How do you do?

1000
01:18:01,928 --> 01:18:04,514
I'm fine, thank you. How are you?

1001
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:07,267
Very well, thank you.
Do you want to come in?

1002
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:08,935
Oh, no, I just--

1003
01:18:09,644 --> 01:18:10,728
Hi.

1004
01:18:11,479 --> 01:18:12,730
Come here.

1005
01:18:13,857 --> 01:18:16,109
Daddy, who is this?

1006
01:18:16,276 --> 01:18:21,447
This is Amanda. And, Amanda,
this is my youngest. Olivia.

1007
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:29,247
Sophie and Olivia.

1008
01:18:29,414 --> 01:18:30,915
Dad.

1009
01:18:31,082 --> 01:18:34,168
- Dad.
- Sorry, yes. Of course, come in.

1010
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:35,795
Come in.

1011
01:18:38,548 --> 01:18:40,091
Okay.

1012
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:49,517
Daddy, can we still have
hot chocolate, please?

1013
01:18:49,684 --> 01:18:51,561
- Yes.
- With baby marshmallows?

1014
01:18:51,728 --> 01:18:53,354
Yes.

1015
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:05,658
Dad, take her coat.

1016
01:19:06,326 --> 01:19:10,163
- Yes. May I, may I...?
- Oh, sure. Thanks.

1017
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:13,291
Are you married? Tell me fast.

1018
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:15,084
- No.
- Okay.

1019
01:19:18,838 --> 01:19:21,007
I know. I'm a tad overdressed.

1020
01:19:21,174 --> 01:19:23,176
You look like my Barbie.

1021
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:28,431
- Thanks.
- Is that for us?

1022
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:33,353
Yes. Except for I'm sorry
about the wine.

1023
01:19:41,569 --> 01:19:44,280
I apologize for not
having mentioned this earlier.

1024
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:47,492
You're D-l-V-O-R-C-E-D?

1025
01:19:49,494 --> 01:19:53,206
W-I-D-O-W-E-R.

1026
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,500
Two years ago.

1027
01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:04,008
Amanda, are you by any chance
at all into hot chocolate?

1028
01:20:06,219 --> 01:20:09,097
As a matter of fact, I'm...

1029
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:11,391
...totally into it.

1030
01:20:11,766 --> 01:20:14,394
- Here we go, Olivia. Olivia...
- Thank you.

1031
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,853
... blow on it. It's hot.

1032
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:19,732
You too, Soph.

1033
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:21,609
She has more marshmallows
than me.

1034
01:20:21,776 --> 01:20:23,736
No, she doesn't.
You each have five.

1035
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:26,364
- You have five too.
- Thank you.

1036
01:20:26,531 --> 01:20:29,701
One, two, three, four, five.

1037
01:20:34,914 --> 01:20:37,083
What? Do I have something
on my lip?

1038
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:39,544
Just look! There.

1039
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:43,715
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

1040
01:20:43,881 --> 01:20:46,926
- Hello.
- Going up! Blow on mine.

1041
01:20:48,928 --> 01:20:50,888
Thank you.

1042
01:20:51,055 --> 01:20:52,265
Excellent timing.

1043
01:20:53,016 --> 01:20:56,019
Dad, do Mr. Napkin Head.

1044
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:58,730
- No. No, no, no. No Mr. Napkin Head.
- Please? Do it!

1045
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:02,358
- Do it. Do it. Please.
- Do it, please. Beg you, please?

1046
01:21:02,525 --> 01:21:05,319
Please? Okay, I'll do it quickly.

1047
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:08,156
- Oh, well, thank you for that.
- You're welcome. Now do it.

1048
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:09,907
All right.

1049
01:21:11,117 --> 01:21:13,828
Amanda, can I borrow
your napkin, please?

1050
01:21:13,995 --> 01:21:15,288
Yes.

1051
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:17,123
Your glasses.

1052
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:18,791
Pass me those when I need them.

1053
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:21,210
Amanda, you're gonna love this.

1054
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:25,757
It's so funny. I mean, you'll fall
off your chair, it's so funny.

1055
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:28,426
Hello.

1056
01:21:30,595 --> 01:21:33,473
Hello, my name is Mr. Napkin Head.

1057
01:21:34,265 --> 01:21:36,934
- Hello, children.
- Who's this? She's a stranger?

1058
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:39,479
- Amanda.
- And why has she got a funny accent?

1059
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:42,190
- Amanda.
- Yeah, but where is she from?

1060
01:21:43,649 --> 01:21:46,778
Now smoke!

1061
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:49,322
Go on.

1062
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:55,328
Smoking's really bad for you.

1063
01:21:57,663 --> 01:21:59,749
Amanda, guess what.

1064
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:02,835
We have a tent in our playroom.
Do you want to see it?

1065
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:05,004
No, no, no. Amanda...

1066
01:22:05,171 --> 01:22:08,424
...will not crawl into your tent.

1067
01:22:08,925 --> 01:22:11,969
You don't like tents?

1068
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,606
Okay, this is seriously cool.

1069
01:22:23,773 --> 01:22:25,775
Come inside.

1070
01:22:29,487 --> 01:22:30,863
- Lie down.
- Okay.

1071
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:33,950
Here, Amanda.
You can use my pillow.

1072
01:22:34,117 --> 01:22:35,660
- Thank you.
- Lie down!

1073
01:22:35,827 --> 01:22:37,662
Can you please
stop being so bossy?

1074
01:22:37,829 --> 01:22:41,374
- Lie down, please, next to me.
- Okay.

1075
01:22:46,337 --> 01:22:48,673
Very nice.

1076
01:22:49,298 --> 01:22:51,551
Excuse me.

1077
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:57,723
This is an exceptionally great tent.

1078
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:59,267
It's got something, hasn't it?

1079
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:02,520
- It's cozy.
- Yeah.

1080
01:23:02,687 --> 01:23:04,897
Who cut out
all these beautiful stars?

1081
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:08,192
- We did.
- The Three Musketeers!

1082
01:23:19,579 --> 01:23:21,038
Amanda?

1083
01:23:21,581 --> 01:23:24,000
- Yes?
- You smell lovely.

1084
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:25,418
Do I?

1085
01:23:25,585 --> 01:23:30,298
Yes. I love perfume,
but he won't let me wear it.

1086
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:33,342
Because you already smell so good.

1087
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:36,179
- So do you, by the way.
- Thanks.

1088
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:40,099
- But I'm older, so I guess I'm allowed.
- Exactly.

1089
01:23:40,641 --> 01:23:42,810
I like your eye shadow.

1090
01:23:42,977 --> 01:23:44,395
Thank you.

1091
01:23:44,896 --> 01:23:47,356
- And your lipstick.
- Thank you.

1092
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:50,526
- It's new.
- What's it called?

1093
01:23:50,693 --> 01:23:54,322
I think it's called Berry Kiss.

1094
01:23:54,488 --> 01:23:57,116
Very Berry Kiss it is.

1095
01:23:58,492 --> 01:24:00,620
Berry Kiss.

1096
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:04,624
Let's see? It looks good on you.

1097
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:06,125
Amanda?

1098
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:10,796
You know, if you wanted to sleep over,
that would be all right.

1099
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:12,548
We could push our beds together.

1100
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:15,635
Sorry.

1101
01:24:16,636 --> 01:24:18,596
That's so sweet of you
to invite me...

1102
01:24:18,763 --> 01:24:22,225
... but maybe another time.
Would that be all right?

1103
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:24,352
Yes.

1104
01:24:26,938 --> 01:24:28,814
Good girl.

1105
01:24:32,235 --> 01:24:35,446
We never have grownups here
that are girls.

1106
01:24:35,947 --> 01:24:37,073
I know.

1107
01:24:37,615 --> 01:24:39,492
I really like it.

1108
01:24:39,659 --> 01:24:42,328
Me too.

1109
01:25:01,305 --> 01:25:04,600
I can't imagine anyone being
a bigger hit with my children.

1110
01:25:06,477 --> 01:25:07,770
They're really great, Graham.

1111
01:25:08,562 --> 01:25:11,524
Sophie's unfortunately taken
on the role as my protector.

1112
01:25:11,691 --> 01:25:14,986
She's brilliant, but I hate it
when she worries about me.

1113
01:25:15,152 --> 01:25:16,779
And Olivia's...

1114
01:25:16,946 --> 01:25:19,198
...gonna be a real ball-buster.

1115
01:25:19,365 --> 01:25:22,368
Which, I must admit,
I kind of love about her.

1116
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:25,997
I'm trying to figure out
why you didn't tell me about them.

1117
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:30,626
Because I just don't usually
tell women about them.

1118
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:32,795
But it's just a little confusing...

1119
01:25:32,962 --> 01:25:35,631
... because you're the one
who wanted to go out to lunch...

1120
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:37,341
...to get to know one another.

1121
01:25:37,508 --> 01:25:40,511
When you put it that way,
it sounds awful.

1122
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:45,391
I have no defense. Except that until
I get to know someone really well...

1123
01:25:45,558 --> 01:25:47,935
... it's easier for me to
be a normal, single guy.

1124
01:25:48,102 --> 01:25:52,064
Because it's way too complicated
to be who I really am.

1125
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:54,525
I'm a full-time dad.

1126
01:25:54,692 --> 01:25:57,945
I'm a working parent.
I'm a mother and a father.

1127
01:25:58,112 --> 01:26:02,241
I'm a guy who reads parenting books
and cookbooks before I go to sleep.

1128
01:26:02,408 --> 01:26:05,953
I spend my weekends buying tutus.
I'm learning to sew.

1129
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,788
I'm Mr. Napkin Head!

1130
01:26:07,955 --> 01:26:11,876
I'm on some kind of
constant overload and it helps...

1131
01:26:12,752 --> 01:26:16,756
...to compartmentalize my life.
Just till I figure this out.

1132
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:20,134
This past weekend, the children
were with their grandparents.

1133
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:23,429
And when they're gone,
I get to be somebody...

1134
01:26:23,596 --> 01:26:26,766
...who doesn't have hot chocolate
spilled on his jeans.

1135
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:31,437
I have no idea how to date
and be this.

1136
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:33,898
And I suppose there's...

1137
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:37,568
...the possibility I'm afraid
of what another person...

1138
01:26:37,735 --> 01:26:39,945
... might do to who we are...

1139
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:42,615
...and how we get from
one day to the next.

1140
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:48,621
Yeah.

1141
01:26:49,747 --> 01:26:53,000
I guess since I am
leaving in a week, I...

1142
01:26:53,876 --> 01:26:56,295
I sort of get you not telling me.

1143
01:26:57,129 --> 01:27:00,299
- Sort of.
- I thought it would be hard...

1144
01:27:00,466 --> 01:27:03,386
...to introduce them to someone
I may never see again.

1145
01:27:08,933 --> 01:27:10,393
Right.

1146
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:15,272
Because I'm just someone you had
sex with once and slept with twice.

1147
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:19,985
I thought I was just someone you had
sex with once and slept with twice.

1148
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:21,904
Oh, man.

1149
01:27:23,614 --> 01:27:26,158
I think we just went
way past complicated.

1150
01:27:26,325 --> 01:27:30,704
Right. I'm a book editor
from London. You're a...

1151
01:27:31,497 --> 01:27:33,124
... beautiful...

1152
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:36,419
... movie trailer-maker from L.A.

1153
01:27:37,253 --> 01:27:39,505
We're worlds apart.

1154
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:42,383
I have a cow in the back yard.

1155
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:44,844
- You have a cow?
- Yeah.

1156
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:47,680
I sew and I have a cow.

1157
01:27:47,847 --> 01:27:50,349
How's that for hard to relate to?

1158
01:27:54,353 --> 01:27:56,313
Pretty up there.

1159
01:27:57,815 --> 01:27:59,483
Exactly.

1160
01:28:13,122 --> 01:28:14,707
- Morning, Jesus.
- Good morning.

1161
01:28:14,874 --> 01:28:16,834
- Santa Anas?
- Oh, yeah, long time now.

1162
01:28:17,001 --> 01:28:19,378
- Hi, Marta.
- Hi, Iris.

1163
01:28:22,548 --> 01:28:24,049
Hi there.

1164
01:28:24,967 --> 01:28:26,677
Hello!

1165
01:28:27,636 --> 01:28:29,054
Good morning.

1166
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:31,015
I counted.

1167
01:28:31,182 --> 01:28:33,434
Nine movies are opening today.

1168
01:28:33,601 --> 01:28:36,479
I remember when nine movies
would open in a month.

1169
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:42,234
Now a picture has to make a killing
the first weekend or they're dead.

1170
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:45,237
This is supposed to be conducive
to great work?

1171
01:28:45,404 --> 01:28:48,741
Arthur, have you always
been this feisty?

1172
01:28:48,908 --> 01:28:52,077
Well, I may have slowed down
a little, but yes.

1173
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:54,580
You've gotta fight the fight, kid.

1174
01:28:55,581 --> 01:28:56,707
Okay, your mail.

1175
01:28:57,249 --> 01:29:00,419
Gas company, phone bill.

1176
01:29:00,586 --> 01:29:04,215
And a letter from the
Writers Guild of America, West.

1177
01:29:07,218 --> 01:29:09,178
Are you watching the movies
I recommended?

1178
01:29:09,345 --> 01:29:13,349
Yes! Love them.
Irene Dunne is fantastic.

1179
01:29:13,516 --> 01:29:16,810
- Gumption.
- Oh, my God, tons of it.

1180
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:20,439
Arthur, don't you want to open that
letter you just threw in the bin?

1181
01:29:20,606 --> 01:29:23,150
No. They keep writing me
about the same thing.

1182
01:29:23,317 --> 01:29:24,902
But it might be important.

1183
01:29:25,069 --> 01:29:29,949
It's not. They want to arrange
some kind of tribute to me.

1184
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:31,909
A night with me.

1185
01:29:32,076 --> 01:29:33,744
I don't know. It sounds God-awful.

1186
01:29:33,911 --> 01:29:36,789
What are you talking about?
That sounds brilliant!

1187
01:29:36,956 --> 01:29:42,795
Would you like to walk out on a stage,
on a walker, looking 100 years old...

1188
01:29:42,962 --> 01:29:45,965
...and see 11 schnooks
who showed up just to see you?

1189
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:47,925
They can forget it.

1190
01:29:48,092 --> 01:29:49,969
I ain't falling for this.

1191
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:53,639
So now, what's up?

1192
01:29:53,973 --> 01:29:55,558
May I?

1193
01:30:00,813 --> 01:30:02,815
"An Evening With Arthur Abbott."

1194
01:30:04,525 --> 01:30:08,153
"Dear Mr. Abbott... --several
attempts to contact you regarding..."

1195
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:11,282
"We have not yet received
your response.

1196
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:14,827
This special night
will be a tribute to your...

1197
01:30:14,994 --> 01:30:19,081
... lifetime screenwriting achievement
and contribution to the profession.

1198
01:30:19,248 --> 01:30:22,251
Congratulations on this
much-deserved honor."

1199
01:30:22,876 --> 01:30:24,712
Arthur, this is a big deal.

1200
01:30:24,878 --> 01:30:27,089
You know, and they want
to do this soon.

1201
01:30:27,923 --> 01:30:31,218
Listen, I reckon
that with a little bit of exercise...

1202
01:30:31,385 --> 01:30:33,095
...you could walk out on your own.

1203
01:30:33,262 --> 01:30:35,848
And, you know,
maybe I could go with you.

1204
01:30:36,015 --> 01:30:39,184
As, like, your date or something.

1205
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:42,980
I would take you proudly,
my darling, but I'm not going.

1206
01:30:43,814 --> 01:30:48,527
Anyway, how would you propose
to get me in shape? Seriously.

1207
01:30:49,695 --> 01:30:51,030
Easy.

1208
01:30:52,072 --> 01:30:54,283
You're doing really well.

1209
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:58,203
Nearly there. Nearly there.
Nearly there.

1210
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:01,790
Bravo! Here we go,
back the other way.

1211
01:31:07,755 --> 01:31:09,840
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1212
01:31:10,007 --> 01:31:12,509
- You sure?
- Yeah, I just slipped.

1213
01:31:33,238 --> 01:31:35,532
- Hello?
- <i>So are you ever coming home?</i>

1214
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:37,910
- Oh, my God. Hi.
- How's it going?

1215
01:31:38,077 --> 01:31:39,578
Great. I met a really nice guy.

1216
01:31:39,745 --> 01:31:42,039
See? And you said you'd never.
What's he like?

1217
01:31:42,206 --> 01:31:44,458
He's really cute. I feel great
when I'm with him...

1218
01:31:44,625 --> 01:31:48,712
...which is an entirely new experience.
And he's about 90 years old.

1219
01:31:48,879 --> 01:31:50,798
- Come on.
- <i>He's my next-door neighbor.</i>

1220
01:31:50,964 --> 01:31:54,218
Or Amanda's next-door neighbor.
By the way, you should go meet her.

1221
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:58,597
- Yeah. I have, actually.
- Oh, bugger. Call waiting.

1222
01:31:58,764 --> 01:32:01,725
Can you hold for a sec? Hold on.
I really wanna talk to you.

1223
01:32:01,892 --> 01:32:03,727
- Sure.
- Hello.

1224
01:32:03,894 --> 01:32:07,106
- Iris, hi, it's Amanda.
- How are you? How's it going?

1225
01:32:07,272 --> 01:32:10,359
- Everything's great. How are you?
- Oh, <i>I'm loving it.</i>

1226
01:32:10,526 --> 01:32:12,986
Can you hold for a sec?
My brother's on the other line.

1227
01:32:13,153 --> 01:32:15,447
- Graham?
- Yes. He said you met.

1228
01:32:15,614 --> 01:32:18,992
- Yes, we did meet. How is he?
- <i>Fine, I think.</i>

1229
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:20,869
- Can you just hold on for a sec?
- Sure.

1230
01:32:21,036 --> 01:32:24,707
- Okay. Hi, sorry. That was Amanda.
- <i>How'd she sound?</i>

1231
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:27,376
- How is she doing?
- She just asked me how you are.

1232
01:32:27,543 --> 01:32:29,586
- And what did you say?
- I asked her to hold.

1233
01:32:29,753 --> 01:32:32,798
- Can I call you back?
- I can hold while you speak to her.

1234
01:32:32,965 --> 01:32:35,676
- Really?
- Find out how she is.

1235
01:32:35,843 --> 01:32:38,554
Okay. My brother wants to know
how you are.

1236
01:32:38,721 --> 01:32:42,808
Can you tell him I'm good and that
I'm just walking Charlie in the village.

1237
01:32:42,975 --> 01:32:45,769
- What's he been up to? Did he say?
- I'm not sure.

1238
01:32:45,936 --> 01:32:48,814
- <i>Do you want me to ask him?</i>
- Sure.

1239
01:32:49,398 --> 01:32:52,234
Okay. Hold, please.

1240
01:32:52,985 --> 01:32:56,572
I can't believe that you have had sex
with the woman staying in my house!

1241
01:32:57,448 --> 01:32:58,991
He told you that?

1242
01:32:59,158 --> 01:33:01,118
- Oh, my God !
- Oh, my God!

1243
01:33:01,285 --> 01:33:04,872
Oh, my God. I thought I was talking
to Graham ! Can you just hold, please?

1244
01:33:05,038 --> 01:33:07,166
I'm terribly sorry.

1245
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:09,835
I can't believe you
had sex with Amanda!

1246
01:33:10,002 --> 01:33:12,921
The one thing she asked me was,
"Are there any men in your town?"

1247
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,840
I assured her that there were not.

1248
01:33:15,007 --> 01:33:17,593
Then you meet her and immediately
get into her knickers!

1249
01:33:18,552 --> 01:33:20,179
Still me.

1250
01:33:20,929 --> 01:33:23,098
Bollocks! I must have lost him.

1251
01:33:23,265 --> 01:33:26,685
Amanda, I am so sorry.

1252
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:29,897
<i>Can I call you back?</i>

1253
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:33,192
- Sure.
- <i>Okay, bye.</i>

1254
01:33:34,067 --> 01:33:36,111
Yes, hello.

1255
01:33:37,237 --> 01:33:39,156
It's Miles. Am I in trouble?

1256
01:33:39,698 --> 01:33:42,201
Oh, Miles. Hi.

1257
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:44,036
<i>What are you up to
this Christmas Eve?</i>

1258
01:33:44,203 --> 01:33:46,205
Not much. But in a little bit...

1259
01:33:46,371 --> 01:33:49,666
... I'm gonna go to the video shop
and get the next movie on Arthur's list.

1260
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:51,627
Do you want some company?

1261
01:33:53,086 --> 01:33:54,546
Love some.

1262
01:33:55,672 --> 01:33:59,718
Hey, I got you the best drink
in town, but I didn't know...

1263
01:33:59,885 --> 01:34:02,721
... if you liked a little dollop
of whipped cream or a big one...

1264
01:34:02,888 --> 01:34:05,724
...so I got both and you can have
each one-- Hello, big dollop!

1265
01:34:05,891 --> 01:34:07,893
- Say, you look great, by the way.
- Thanks.

1266
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:10,229
- Really great.
- Thanks, I'm feeling good.

1267
01:34:10,395 --> 01:34:12,981
I've been working out with Arthur.

1268
01:34:13,148 --> 01:34:14,399
- What?
- No.

1269
01:34:14,566 --> 01:34:18,570
I'm sure it's an awesome workout.
I'm sorry. I'm trying not to picture it.

1270
01:34:18,737 --> 01:34:21,532
Okay, well, the workout's
not that great, but the conver--

1271
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:22,991
Stop laughing!

1272
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:27,371
- The conversation is truly fantastic.
- No, that I totally believe.

1273
01:34:27,538 --> 01:34:31,250
Now let me ask you.
Have you seen this?

1274
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:33,752
<i>Chariots of Fire.</i> Loved it.

1275
01:34:39,675 --> 01:34:42,010
Such a great score by Vangelis.

1276
01:34:42,177 --> 01:34:45,514
He took electronic scores to a new
level. It was groundbreaking.

1277
01:34:45,681 --> 01:34:48,433
I'm gonna test you on this later.
Okay. <i>Driving Miss Daisy.</i>

1278
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,937
Hans. Very unexpected.
Do you remember how great it was?

1279
01:34:58,110 --> 01:35:00,028
Sassy! Love it.

1280
01:35:00,195 --> 01:35:01,446
- Is this a bad game?
- No!

1281
01:35:01,613 --> 01:35:03,156
- Okay.
- Keep going.

1282
01:35:03,365 --> 01:35:05,742
Sometimes I get self-conscious
about my--

1283
01:35:08,787 --> 01:35:09,788
And:

1284
01:35:12,207 --> 01:35:18,088
<i>Are you embarrassed
By this game I've started to play?</i>

1285
01:35:18,255 --> 01:35:21,592
Okay. It's not a library.
I can go loud.

1286
01:35:24,428 --> 01:35:26,471
Two notes and you've got a villain.

1287
01:35:27,848 --> 01:35:30,100
I don't know what to say about it.
Totally brill.

1288
01:35:34,396 --> 01:35:37,900
I bet you didn't know that was all
written for the movie. It was a score.

1289
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:39,943
- I did know that one.
- Can't go anywhere.

1290
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:43,405
Oh, my God. Okay, this one?
You have to check this out some time.

1291
01:35:43,572 --> 01:35:45,824
<i>The Mission.</i>
The score is genius.

1292
01:35:45,991 --> 01:35:49,286
It just comes from
a totally different place. It's like...

1293
01:35:49,453 --> 01:35:53,165
I can't even... Just promise me
you'll rent it and listen to it.

1294
01:35:53,332 --> 01:35:55,042
- Renting.
- Thank you.

1295
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:56,251
It changed my world.

1296
01:36:04,343 --> 01:36:05,844
What?

1297
01:36:10,891 --> 01:36:12,476
Maggie!

1298
01:36:27,574 --> 01:36:32,162
- Why do I always fall for the bad girl?
- You didn't know she was a bad girl.

1299
01:36:33,163 --> 01:36:35,415
I knew she wasn't good.

1300
01:36:35,707 --> 01:36:38,877
Do you have anything
a little bit stronger?

1301
01:36:39,711 --> 01:36:43,507
Thank you. Let me rephrase this:

1302
01:36:46,218 --> 01:36:50,013
Why am I attracted to a person
I know isn't good?

1303
01:36:50,889 --> 01:36:54,768
I happen to know the answer to this.
You're hoping you're wrong.

1304
01:36:54,935 --> 01:36:57,729
She does something that tells you
she's no good, you ignore it.

1305
01:36:57,896 --> 01:37:01,024
Every time she comes through and
surprises you, she wins you over...

1306
01:37:01,191 --> 01:37:04,861
...and you lose that argument
with yourself that she's not for you.

1307
01:37:05,237 --> 01:37:06,238
Exactly.

1308
01:37:07,406 --> 01:37:09,366
And on top of that,
there's the old standby:

1309
01:37:09,533 --> 01:37:12,577
"I can't believe a girl like that
would be with a guy like me."

1310
01:37:13,453 --> 01:37:15,163
You know what she said
to me tonight?

1311
01:37:15,664 --> 01:37:17,666
She finished in Santa Fe
after two days...

1312
01:37:17,833 --> 01:37:20,085
...and has been staying with
whatever-his-name-was.

1313
01:37:20,252 --> 01:37:22,254
Which means she's been
right here in town.

1314
01:37:22,671 --> 01:37:25,382
When I spoke to her this morning
on her cell and she said:

1315
01:37:25,549 --> 01:37:27,718
"I'm looking out my window
and it's snowing."

1316
01:37:27,884 --> 01:37:30,429
She was in Santa Monica.

1317
01:37:30,637 --> 01:37:32,431
What did she do,
go to Weather.com?

1318
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:34,766
That must have made them
scream with laughter.

1319
01:37:34,933 --> 01:37:38,854
And in the meantime, I sent her
Christmas gift to Santa Fe yesterday.

1320
01:37:39,021 --> 01:37:42,774
I stood in line at FedEx
to make sure she got it on time.

1321
01:37:43,483 --> 01:37:45,736
Classic, right?

1322
01:37:46,528 --> 01:37:50,115
I don't wanna ruin your Christmas Eve.
You don't have to listen to this.

1323
01:37:50,282 --> 01:37:52,159
It's okay.

1324
01:37:52,826 --> 01:37:54,244
I like the company.

1325
01:37:59,332 --> 01:38:00,625
So how about some food?

1326
01:38:00,792 --> 01:38:03,378
Shall I make us
a little Christmas fettuccine?

1327
01:38:03,545 --> 01:38:06,715
- Sure.
- Listen.

1328
01:38:07,174 --> 01:38:10,969
I know it's hard to believe people
when they say, "I know how you feel."

1329
01:38:12,554 --> 01:38:15,307
But I actually know how you feel.

1330
01:38:16,725 --> 01:38:18,477
You see...

1331
01:38:19,311 --> 01:38:20,771
... I was...

1332
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:25,150
...seeing someone back in London.

1333
01:38:25,525 --> 01:38:27,819
We worked for
the same newspaper.

1334
01:38:27,986 --> 01:38:32,532
And then I found out that he was
also seeing this other girl, Sarah...

1335
01:38:32,699 --> 01:38:35,577
...from the Circulation Department
on the 19th floor.

1336
01:38:36,495 --> 01:38:40,415
It turned out that he wasn't
in love with me like I thought.

1337
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:45,378
What I'm trying to say is...

1338
01:38:45,545 --> 01:38:49,132
... I understand feeling
as small and as insignificant...

1339
01:38:49,299 --> 01:38:51,843
...as humanly possible.

1340
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:56,681
How it can actually ache in places that
you didn't know you had inside you.

1341
01:38:57,974 --> 01:39:00,185
It doesn't matter how many
new haircuts you get...

1342
01:39:00,352 --> 01:39:02,354
...or gyms you join...

1343
01:39:02,854 --> 01:39:05,816
...or how many glasses of chardonnay
you drink with girlfriends.

1344
01:39:05,982 --> 01:39:09,569
You still go to bed every night
going over every detail...

1345
01:39:09,736 --> 01:39:15,367
...and wonder what you did wrong
or how you could have misunderstood.

1346
01:39:16,576 --> 01:39:18,578
And how in the hell,
for that brief moment...

1347
01:39:18,745 --> 01:39:21,039
...you could think that you were
that happy?

1348
01:39:21,206 --> 01:39:23,291
And sometimes you can
even convince yourself...

1349
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:26,169
...that he'll see the light
and show up at your door.

1350
01:39:29,214 --> 01:39:31,049
And after all that...

1351
01:39:31,591 --> 01:39:34,678
... however long "all that" may be...

1352
01:39:35,637 --> 01:39:37,973
...you'll go somewhere new.

1353
01:39:38,223 --> 01:39:41,935
And you'll meet people who make you
feel worthwhile again.

1354
01:39:43,103 --> 01:39:47,315
And little pieces of your soul
will finally come back.

1355
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:49,151
And all that fuzzy stuff...

1356
01:39:51,403 --> 01:39:55,949
...those years of your life
that you wasted...

1357
01:39:58,577 --> 01:40:01,413
...that will eventually begin to fade.

1358
01:40:03,707 --> 01:40:04,708
Well, fuck.

1359
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:07,586
You need this more than I do.

1360
01:40:10,505 --> 01:40:13,466
That's what you're doing here?
You're getting over somebody?

1361
01:40:13,633 --> 01:40:15,260
Yeah.

1362
01:40:15,886 --> 01:40:17,262
This is me in good shape.

1363
01:40:18,013 --> 01:40:20,265
Is this the guy who sent you pages
from his novel?

1364
01:40:20,765 --> 01:40:22,434
Yeah.

1365
01:40:23,226 --> 01:40:24,269
He needs me.

1366
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:26,938
So he stays in touch?

1367
01:40:27,105 --> 01:40:29,524
All the time.

1368
01:40:29,691 --> 01:40:33,111
That makes it impossible to forget,
which is great for him, sucks for you.

1369
01:40:34,279 --> 01:40:36,615
You see how great your life is
compared to mine?

1370
01:40:37,949 --> 01:40:41,286
Okay, let's go.
I'm making you some fettuccine.

1371
01:40:41,453 --> 01:40:45,040
It is Christmas Eve, and we
are going to sit out on that patio...

1372
01:40:45,207 --> 01:40:47,792
...gonna make ourselves a little fire,
pop some bubbly...

1373
01:40:47,959 --> 01:40:51,463
...and we are gonna celebrate
being young and being alive.

1374
01:40:53,256 --> 01:40:55,133
You with me, Simpkins?

1375
01:40:56,468 --> 01:40:58,220
Miles.

1376
01:41:00,138 --> 01:41:02,599
You really are
an incredibly decent man.

1377
01:41:02,974 --> 01:41:04,809
I know.

1378
01:41:04,976 --> 01:41:07,812
That's always been my problem.

1379
01:42:23,096 --> 01:42:25,056
Hi.

1380
01:42:40,697 --> 01:42:43,158
Okay, here it is.

1381
01:42:43,325 --> 01:42:45,952
Arthur's theme.
I think this is really good.

1382
01:42:46,119 --> 01:42:47,329
- I'm serious.
- No, I know.

1383
01:42:47,495 --> 01:42:50,081
I'm making him a CD of this tune.
Every time he hears it...

1384
01:42:50,248 --> 01:42:52,959
... it should give him the confidence
to walk right out there.

1385
01:42:53,126 --> 01:42:54,294
- Okay?
- Yep.

1386
01:42:54,461 --> 01:42:56,171
Here we go.

1387
01:42:59,758 --> 01:43:01,676
Did I steal this?

1388
01:43:02,177 --> 01:43:05,305
- John Williams.
- I didn't write it, that's why.

1389
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:06,931
- Okay, this is it for real.
- Okay.

1390
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:08,725
- Here we go.
- Yep.

1391
01:43:09,768 --> 01:43:12,270
A little Arthur and the knights.

1392
01:43:16,775 --> 01:43:18,777
Right? It's cheeky.

1393
01:43:19,861 --> 01:43:22,280
It sounds like him.

1394
01:43:26,493 --> 01:43:28,286
I also wrote one
that sounds like you.

1395
01:43:30,872 --> 01:43:31,873
You did?

1396
01:43:34,209 --> 01:43:37,337
Iris, if you were a melody.

1397
01:43:43,301 --> 01:43:45,970
I used only the good notes.

1398
01:43:58,691 --> 01:44:02,362
<i>Iris lives next door</i>

1399
01:44:02,529 --> 01:44:07,951
<i>To Arthur
He's a doodle-ee-doo</i>

1400
01:44:08,118 --> 01:44:10,578
<i>-And also a doodle-ee-doo
- Scroodle-ee-doo</i>

1401
01:44:10,745 --> 01:44:13,289
- A scroodle-ee-doo? I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

1402
01:44:13,456 --> 01:44:15,166
<i>-And froodle-ee-doo
- And froodle-ee-doo</i>

1403
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:17,043
We both said "froodle-ee."

1404
01:44:17,210 --> 01:44:18,711
I'm impressed.

1405
01:44:18,878 --> 01:44:20,130
You are a prodigy.

1406
01:44:20,296 --> 01:44:21,548
A "doodle" prodigy.

1407
01:44:21,714 --> 01:44:23,341
<i>Swoodle-ee-doo</i>

1408
01:44:37,313 --> 01:44:40,525
So you're totally great.

1409
01:44:43,153 --> 01:44:44,821
Yeah.

1410
01:44:44,988 --> 01:44:46,364
This is a bitch.

1411
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:52,370
Well, you must come to London
all the time for work, right?

1412
01:44:52,537 --> 01:44:54,289
London?

1413
01:44:54,664 --> 01:44:56,207
Never.

1414
01:44:57,125 --> 01:44:58,751
New York?

1415
01:44:59,711 --> 01:45:02,464
Not really, but that's easier.
Do you go there often?

1416
01:45:03,089 --> 01:45:04,757
Rarely.

1417
01:45:05,175 --> 01:45:07,135
Long-distance relationships
can work.

1418
01:45:07,719 --> 01:45:09,387
Really? I can't make one work...

1419
01:45:09,554 --> 01:45:11,556
...when I live in the same house
with someone.

1420
01:45:11,723 --> 01:45:14,392
So this could be
a good solution for you.

1421
01:45:17,145 --> 01:45:19,189
Oh, man.

1422
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:23,568
Okay.

1423
01:45:24,235 --> 01:45:25,820
Let's say we just make this happen.

1424
01:45:25,987 --> 01:45:28,406
We commit to flying back and forth
as much as we can.

1425
01:45:28,823 --> 01:45:30,825
Yes! It's doable, definitely.

1426
01:45:30,992 --> 01:45:34,370
And then let's say
in six months we hit a wall.

1427
01:45:34,537 --> 01:45:36,998
Like, I can't constantly
be away from work...

1428
01:45:37,165 --> 01:45:39,709
...or the girls can't deal with you
leaving so often.

1429
01:45:40,043 --> 01:45:43,004
And we start to feel the tension.
We know this isn't gonna work...

1430
01:45:43,171 --> 01:45:46,382
...so we start fighting because
we don't know what else to do.

1431
01:45:46,549 --> 01:45:48,676
And then, after a long, tearful--

1432
01:45:48,843 --> 01:45:50,595
At your end. --phone call...

1433
01:45:50,762 --> 01:45:52,931
- ...we just-- We say goodbye.
- Thank you.

1434
01:45:53,097 --> 01:45:56,351
That'll be it, for real. It's not like
we'll ever bump into each other.

1435
01:45:56,518 --> 01:45:59,395
And then what's left?
Two miserable people...

1436
01:45:59,562 --> 01:46:02,106
...feeling totally mashed up
and hurt.

1437
01:46:09,572 --> 01:46:11,282
Or...

1438
01:46:11,783 --> 01:46:13,576
Thank you.

1439
01:46:16,955 --> 01:46:18,915
Or maybe we should just...

1440
01:46:19,082 --> 01:46:22,961
... realize that what we've had these
past few weeks has been perfect.

1441
01:46:23,670 --> 01:46:25,797
And maybe it won't
get any better than this.

1442
01:46:25,964 --> 01:46:28,132
Maybe we're trying to figure
this thing out...

1443
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:30,301
... because it makes us
feel good to feel this.

1444
01:46:30,468 --> 01:46:32,470
Maybe the fact
that I'm leaving in 8 hours...

1445
01:46:32,637 --> 01:46:36,599
... makes this far more exciting
than it might actually be.

1446
01:46:37,809 --> 01:46:39,269
Maybe.

1447
01:46:39,435 --> 01:46:42,564
You are, seriously,
the most depressing girl I've ever met.

1448
01:46:43,773 --> 01:46:45,650
I know.

1449
01:46:47,986 --> 01:46:50,029
I have another scenario for you.

1450
01:46:50,196 --> 01:46:52,740
- Good.
- I'm in love with you.

1451
01:46:58,496 --> 01:47:01,040
I apologize for the blunt delivery.

1452
01:47:01,624 --> 01:47:04,544
But as problematical as this...

1453
01:47:04,711 --> 01:47:07,755
...fact may be, I am in love.

1454
01:47:08,631 --> 01:47:09,632
With you.

1455
01:47:11,301 --> 01:47:13,261
I'm not feeling this
because you're leaving.

1456
01:47:13,428 --> 01:47:15,513
And not because it feels good
to feel this way.

1457
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:19,559
Which, by the way, it does--
Or did, before you went off like that.

1458
01:47:19,726 --> 01:47:21,936
I can't figure out
the mathematics of this.

1459
01:47:22,103 --> 01:47:25,148
I just know I love you.

1460
01:47:25,315 --> 01:47:28,026
Can't believe how many times
I'm saying it.

1461
01:47:28,192 --> 01:47:31,696
And I never thought I'd feel this way
again, so that's pretty phenomenal.

1462
01:47:32,030 --> 01:47:35,867
And I realize I come
with a package deal:

1463
01:47:36,034 --> 01:47:38,703
Three for the price of one. And my...

1464
01:47:39,037 --> 01:47:42,540
... package, perhaps in the light of day,
isn't all that wonderful...

1465
01:47:42,707 --> 01:47:47,879
... but I finally know what I want,
and that, in itself, is a miracle.

1466
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:51,466
And what I want...

1467
01:47:52,091 --> 01:47:53,635
... is you.

1468
01:48:03,811 --> 01:48:06,356
I wasn't expecting "I love you."

1469
01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:16,407
Can you not look at me like that?

1470
01:48:16,574 --> 01:48:19,243
I'm trying to find
the right thing to say.

1471
01:48:23,289 --> 01:48:25,750
I think if the obvious response...

1472
01:48:25,917 --> 01:48:28,544
...doesn't immediately
come to you, we can...

1473
01:48:29,754 --> 01:48:31,297
...just...

1474
01:48:32,715 --> 01:48:34,509
We should just...

1475
01:48:34,676 --> 01:48:36,427
...talk about something else.

1476
01:48:36,594 --> 01:48:40,765
Like, possibly,
what a complete ass I am.

1477
01:48:40,932 --> 01:48:45,895
I do recall you promising me
you wouldn't fall in love with me.

1478
01:48:46,062 --> 01:48:47,438
Must pay better attention.

1479
01:48:48,106 --> 01:48:50,191
I've never met a guy
who talks as much as me.

1480
01:48:51,526 --> 01:48:52,944
But could you just for now...

1481
01:48:53,569 --> 01:48:55,321
... be quiet?

1482
01:48:55,571 --> 01:48:56,572
Please?

1483
01:49:13,297 --> 01:49:15,800
How many of his movies
are on that list of his?

1484
01:49:15,967 --> 01:49:17,635
About 15. I love it.

1485
01:49:17,802 --> 01:49:20,638
I don't know how I've never seen
<i>The Lady Eve</i> before.

1486
01:49:20,805 --> 01:49:22,473
Barbara Stanwyck is dazzling.

1487
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:25,518
- And she's so sure of herself.
- And sexy.

1488
01:49:25,685 --> 01:49:28,229
Really sexy! You know,
every movie he's told me to see...

1489
01:49:28,396 --> 01:49:31,232
- ... has this powerhouse woman in it.
- Wonder if he's trying...

1490
01:49:31,399 --> 01:49:36,237
...to tell you something with that.
Okay, sorry about that. Boob graze.

1491
01:49:37,655 --> 01:49:40,908
That was accidental.
Accidental boob graze.

1492
01:49:43,494 --> 01:49:45,288
I'm sorry.

1493
01:49:46,622 --> 01:49:48,958
- Changing subject.
- Okay.

1494
01:49:49,125 --> 01:49:51,711
Arthur has requested...

1495
01:49:51,878 --> 01:49:55,006
...that you write some lyrics
for his theme song.

1496
01:49:55,173 --> 01:49:56,924
What's the matter? Who is it?

1497
01:49:57,091 --> 01:49:58,134
It's Maggie.

1498
01:50:00,219 --> 01:50:01,512
Hello?

1499
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,891
Hi.

1500
01:50:06,517 --> 01:50:08,686
I'm doing okay.

1501
01:50:10,813 --> 01:50:14,776
Actually, Maggie,
I'm a bit tied up at the moment.

1502
01:50:15,985 --> 01:50:18,112
I don't know.
What time could you be there?

1503
01:50:20,698 --> 01:50:22,617
All right, I'll be there.

1504
01:50:22,784 --> 01:50:25,119
Oh, no, no. Like, a half-hour.

1505
01:50:26,037 --> 01:50:28,122
Maybe a little longer.

1506
01:50:29,081 --> 01:50:31,209
Okay, bye.

1507
01:50:35,213 --> 01:50:36,881
She misses me.

1508
01:50:37,048 --> 01:50:40,885
You see? She came to her senses.

1509
01:50:45,389 --> 01:50:47,016
- We should get the bill.
- No!

1510
01:50:47,183 --> 01:50:49,644
No, no, take your time.
I can wait till you're finished.

1511
01:50:49,811 --> 01:50:50,812
- I'm finished.
- No.

1512
01:50:50,978 --> 01:50:54,732
- You didn't get to your spicy tuna yet.
- I'm fine, really.

1513
01:50:55,566 --> 01:50:58,110
You can go. I can get this one.

1514
01:50:58,569 --> 01:51:02,198
I'll see you later at the Writers Guild.
I mean, if you can still make it.

1515
01:51:02,365 --> 01:51:05,785
I gotta get all the way to Silver Lake,
but I'm gonna try to be there.

1516
01:51:06,744 --> 01:51:09,705
Anyway, I'm bringing the music.
I mean, I really wanna be there...

1517
01:51:09,872 --> 01:51:12,166
... but I don't know how long
this is gonna take.

1518
01:51:12,333 --> 01:51:13,751
I'm sorry.

1519
01:51:15,253 --> 01:51:17,547
It's all good. Don't worry.

1520
01:51:21,384 --> 01:51:23,594
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1521
01:52:14,979 --> 01:52:16,314
Hello.

1522
01:52:17,607 --> 01:52:21,652
Oh, Jasper! I'm just reading
your pages.

1523
01:52:22,236 --> 01:52:26,157
No, I hadn't forgotten.
I've just been busy, that's all.

1524
01:52:26,699 --> 01:52:30,286
That's not true. I was gonna call you
when I'd read--

1525
01:52:30,661 --> 01:52:32,330
What kind of surprise?

1526
01:52:32,496 --> 01:52:34,040
No, I don't see a box or anything.

1527
01:52:34,206 --> 01:52:36,250
Yes, I'm sure.

1528
01:52:36,417 --> 01:52:39,170
Hold on, let me just check
the kitchen.

1529
01:52:42,048 --> 01:52:43,674
No, not in there.

1530
01:52:43,841 --> 01:52:45,426
Well, I'll go and check the gate.

1531
01:52:45,593 --> 01:52:49,305
Yes. Well, when did you send it?

1532
01:52:52,725 --> 01:52:54,977
I found your Christmas present.

1533
01:53:04,695 --> 01:53:05,863
This place suits you.

1534
01:53:06,489 --> 01:53:07,865
Yeah, right.

1535
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:10,826
No, really.

1536
01:53:16,207 --> 01:53:19,210
So you are eventually
gonna look at me, aren't you?

1537
01:53:25,508 --> 01:53:26,842
Hello.

1538
01:53:29,512 --> 01:53:32,723
I came here
because I had to see you.

1539
01:53:32,890 --> 01:53:34,642
Had to.

1540
01:53:36,185 --> 01:53:39,438
Oh, Jasper, I really don't
understand this.

1541
01:53:39,605 --> 01:53:41,232
I mean...

1542
01:53:41,399 --> 01:53:45,695
I was right there for three years!
Remember? Square peg, round hole?

1543
01:53:46,570 --> 01:53:47,905
- What?
- That's what you said.

1544
01:53:48,072 --> 01:53:50,074
That we weren't really right
for each other.

1545
01:53:50,241 --> 01:53:52,868
We were a square peg
and a round hole.

1546
01:53:53,035 --> 01:53:55,788
I don't remember that. I just know
I hated when you were gone.

1547
01:53:55,955 --> 01:53:58,499
And also, I have never checked
my e-mails more.

1548
01:53:58,666 --> 01:54:01,752
It was driving me crazy
that I wasn't hearing from you.

1549
01:54:02,753 --> 01:54:05,047
I don't want to lose you, babe.

1550
01:54:07,967 --> 01:54:09,218
Lose me?

1551
01:54:11,846 --> 01:54:14,724
This is too confusing.

1552
01:54:17,685 --> 01:54:19,270
Come here.

1553
01:54:22,106 --> 01:54:25,568
I screwed up.
Miles, haven't you ever screwed up?

1554
01:54:25,735 --> 01:54:27,987
I made a mistake.

1555
01:54:28,946 --> 01:54:31,365
I was stupid and impulsive.

1556
01:54:31,532 --> 01:54:34,827
He wasn't what I thought.
I just started thinking about you...

1557
01:54:34,994 --> 01:54:38,122
...and wishing and hoping
that you would just forgive me.

1558
01:54:38,789 --> 01:54:40,958
Will you, Miles?

1559
01:54:41,208 --> 01:54:43,169
Will you forgive me?

1560
01:54:57,975 --> 01:55:00,061
You know what I was thinking?

1561
01:55:00,227 --> 01:55:01,562
When you get back to London...

1562
01:55:01,729 --> 01:55:04,565
... maybe we could sneak off
somewhere together.

1563
01:55:04,732 --> 01:55:06,525
Maybe Venice.

1564
01:55:06,692 --> 01:55:08,319
You and me in Venice
could be good.

1565
01:55:10,321 --> 01:55:12,656
Do you mean that? I mean...

1566
01:55:13,282 --> 01:55:15,242
Are you free to do that?

1567
01:55:16,452 --> 01:55:17,953
Darling...

1568
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:22,083
... I've just traveled halfway across
the world to see you, haven't I?

1569
01:55:27,671 --> 01:55:31,801
Yeah, that doesn't exactly
answer my question, so...

1570
01:55:31,967 --> 01:55:36,138
Are you not with
Sarah anymore? I mean...

1571
01:55:36,305 --> 01:55:38,682
... is that what you've come here
to tell me?

1572
01:55:39,725 --> 01:55:43,521
I wish you could just accept knowing
how confused I am about all this.

1573
01:55:45,523 --> 01:55:48,526
Okay, let me translate that.

1574
01:55:48,692 --> 01:55:52,154
So you are still engaged
to be married.

1575
01:55:54,281 --> 01:55:58,160
- Yes, but, I mean--
- Oh, my God.

1576
01:55:59,995 --> 01:56:02,331
Okay, this was a really...

1577
01:56:02,498 --> 01:56:03,624
...close call.

1578
01:56:03,791 --> 01:56:06,377
You know, I never thought
I'd say this, literally never...

1579
01:56:06,544 --> 01:56:09,630
... but I think you were
absolutely right about us.

1580
01:56:09,797 --> 01:56:11,966
Very square peg, very round hole!

1581
01:56:12,133 --> 01:56:15,970
- You cannot mean that.
- The great thing is I actually do.

1582
01:56:16,137 --> 01:56:18,472
And I'm about three years late
in telling you this...

1583
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:21,392
... but nevertheless I need to say it.

1584
01:56:21,725 --> 01:56:23,352
Jasper...

1585
01:56:23,519 --> 01:56:24,728
Wait. I need the lights on.

1586
01:56:29,191 --> 01:56:30,234
Jasper...

1587
01:56:33,279 --> 01:56:34,864
...you have never treated me right.

1588
01:56:35,030 --> 01:56:36,574
- Ever.
- Oh, babe.

1589
01:56:38,075 --> 01:56:40,578
You broke my heart.

1590
01:56:40,744 --> 01:56:43,164
And you acted like
somehow it was my fault...

1591
01:56:43,330 --> 01:56:46,292
... my misunderstanding,
and I was too in love with you...

1592
01:56:46,458 --> 01:56:50,337
...to ever be mad at you, so I just
punished myself! For years!

1593
01:56:50,921 --> 01:56:54,508
But you waltzing in here
on my lovely Christmas holiday...

1594
01:56:54,675 --> 01:56:56,927
...and telling me that
you don't want to lose me...

1595
01:56:57,094 --> 01:56:59,555
...whilst you're
about to get married...

1596
01:56:59,722 --> 01:57:02,433
...somehow newly entitles me
to say...

1597
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:05,561
... it's over.

1598
01:57:06,312 --> 01:57:11,775
This-- This twisted,
toxic thing between us...

1599
01:57:11,942 --> 01:57:14,111
... is finally finished!

1600
01:57:14,278 --> 01:57:18,115
I'm miraculously done
being in love with you!

1601
01:57:19,033 --> 01:57:21,535
I've got a life to start living.

1602
01:57:23,162 --> 01:57:25,789
- And you're not going to be in it.
- Darling...

1603
01:57:25,956 --> 01:57:28,292
Now I've got somewhere
really important to be...

1604
01:57:28,459 --> 01:57:31,420
...and you have
got to get the hell out.

1605
01:57:31,921 --> 01:57:34,298
- Now!
- What exactly has got into you?

1606
01:57:35,174 --> 01:57:36,717
I don't know.

1607
01:57:36,884 --> 01:57:40,679
But I think what I've got
is something slightly resembling...

1608
01:57:40,846 --> 01:57:42,264
...gumption.

1609
01:58:07,206 --> 01:58:08,999
Iris...

1610
01:58:09,291 --> 01:58:11,502
...you're a knockout.

1611
01:58:11,752 --> 01:58:13,087
Thank you.

1612
01:58:13,254 --> 01:58:17,174
- And may I say, so are you.
- Did I do my tie okay?

1613
01:58:17,341 --> 01:58:20,469
I haven't worn one in 15 years.

1614
01:58:21,845 --> 01:58:24,932
- It's perfect.
- I like this Hugo Boss.

1615
01:58:25,099 --> 01:58:26,600
He cuts a nice suit.

1616
01:58:27,601 --> 01:58:29,728
I've got something for you.

1617
01:58:37,611 --> 01:58:42,032
Forgive me. The last time
I had a date, this is what we did.

1618
01:58:42,741 --> 01:58:44,493
It's beautiful.

1619
01:58:45,995 --> 01:58:49,373
If it's corny, or if it's
going to ruin your outfit...

1620
01:58:49,540 --> 01:58:51,875
...you don't have to wear it.

1621
01:58:52,876 --> 01:58:55,045
I like corny.

1622
01:58:55,546 --> 01:58:57,673
I'm looking for corny in my life.

1623
01:58:58,549 --> 01:59:02,303
- That's a nice line.
- It's all those movies!

1624
01:59:02,469 --> 01:59:05,055
Okay, let's do it.

1625
01:59:05,222 --> 01:59:07,391
Let's get this embarrassment
over with.

1626
01:59:07,558 --> 01:59:09,476
Okay.

1627
01:59:16,942 --> 01:59:19,194
- Mr. Abbott?
- Yes, sir.

1628
01:59:19,361 --> 01:59:21,572
We're all ready for you.

1629
01:59:34,585 --> 01:59:38,589
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Arthur Abbott!

1630
02:00:01,278 --> 02:00:04,281
- Oh, hi !
- Arthur, you made it.

1631
02:00:05,407 --> 02:00:06,825
Thank you. Thank you too.

1632
02:00:11,246 --> 02:00:12,289
Thank you very much.

1633
02:00:16,919 --> 02:00:19,004
I'll take you up, Mr. Abbott.

1634
02:00:20,422 --> 02:00:22,633
Go on, go for it.

1635
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:40,901
I'll do it.

1636
02:00:53,122 --> 02:00:54,832
The man is a rock star.

1637
02:00:55,666 --> 02:00:56,834
Hi!

1638
02:01:00,295 --> 02:01:03,340
Sorry I'm late. The Maggie thing
took a little time, but it is over.

1639
02:01:03,507 --> 02:01:05,342
Finished, kaput.

1640
02:01:07,428 --> 02:01:08,512
You look beautiful.

1641
02:01:10,180 --> 02:01:11,515
Thank you.

1642
02:01:11,682 --> 02:01:13,142
Thanks.

1643
02:01:13,308 --> 02:01:15,102
Thank you, thank you.

1644
02:01:15,269 --> 02:01:16,645
I'm--

1645
02:01:16,812 --> 02:01:20,190
I'm absolutely overwhelmed...

1646
02:01:21,108 --> 02:01:22,693
...that I could climb those stairs.

1647
02:01:24,027 --> 02:01:25,028
He did great.

1648
02:01:25,779 --> 02:01:29,199
I came to Hollywood
over 60 years ago...

1649
02:01:29,366 --> 02:01:32,035
...and immediately fell in love
with motion pictures.

1650
02:01:32,578 --> 02:01:36,373
And it's a love affair
that's lasted a lifetime.

1651
02:01:36,540 --> 02:01:39,543
When I first arrived in Tinseltown...

1652
02:01:39,710 --> 02:01:43,422
...there were no cineplexes
or multiplexes.

1653
02:01:43,589 --> 02:01:47,759
No such thing as a
Blockbuster or DVD.

1654
02:01:47,926 --> 02:01:51,346
I was here before conglomerates
owned the studios.

1655
02:01:52,014 --> 02:01:55,559
Before pictures
had special-effects teams.

1656
02:01:55,726 --> 02:01:59,354
And definitely before box office
results were reported...

1657
02:01:59,521 --> 02:02:02,858
... like baseball scores
on the nightly news.

1658
02:02:03,233 --> 02:02:06,236
He is so fantastic.

1659
02:02:06,778 --> 02:02:09,656
- Iris?
- Yes?

1660
02:02:09,823 --> 02:02:12,367
What are you doing
New Year's Eve?

1661
02:02:13,744 --> 02:02:15,704
I'll be back in England
by New Year's Eve.

1662
02:02:19,374 --> 02:02:21,877
You know, I've never been
to England.

1663
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:25,506
- I've never been to Europe.
- No?

1664
02:02:25,964 --> 02:02:28,926
If I come over there, will you go out
with me on New Year's Eve?

1665
02:02:33,639 --> 02:02:35,057
Love to.

1666
02:02:56,119 --> 02:02:59,122
We're not gonna make a bigger deal
out of this than it already is.

1667
02:02:59,289 --> 02:03:00,707
No, we're not.

1668
02:03:00,874 --> 02:03:03,377
It's not like we're never
going to speak or e-mail or--

1669
02:03:03,544 --> 02:03:06,463
- No set rules.
- None.

1670
02:03:07,714 --> 02:03:11,009
So now I'm just gonna
kiss you for the millionth time...

1671
02:03:11,176 --> 02:03:12,636
...and say, "Be seeing you."

1672
02:03:28,652 --> 02:03:30,571
Be seeing you.

1673
02:03:35,492 --> 02:03:37,494
Take care of yourself.

1674
02:04:39,348 --> 02:04:41,308
Did you have a good holiday, miss?

1675
02:04:42,100 --> 02:04:43,727
Yeah.

1676
02:04:44,353 --> 02:04:45,812
Great.

1677
02:04:48,565 --> 02:04:50,776
Maybe the best ever.

1678
02:05:45,288 --> 02:05:47,249
<i>Amanda Woods...</i>

1679
02:05:47,416 --> 02:05:49,084
<i>...welcome back.</i>

1680
02:05:51,211 --> 02:05:52,963
Turn around!

1681
02:05:53,547 --> 02:05:55,382
Turn around and go back, please!

1682
02:05:55,549 --> 02:05:59,136
- Did you forget something?
- Yes! Yes.

1683
02:06:10,313 --> 02:06:11,565
Can you go any faster?

1684
02:06:11,732 --> 02:06:13,650
This lane's tricky.
It's gonna take a bit.

1685
02:06:13,817 --> 02:06:15,110
It's okay, just stop.

1686
02:06:21,658 --> 02:06:22,743
Madam?

1687
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:25,287
Madam!

1688
02:07:20,509 --> 02:07:22,052
Graham?

1689
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:24,971
Graham.

1690
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:39,027
You know...

1691
02:07:39,194 --> 02:07:41,530
... I was just thinking...

1692
02:07:42,656 --> 02:07:45,075
...why would I ever leave
before New Year's Eve?

1693
02:07:45,659 --> 02:07:48,203
That makes no sense at all.

1694
02:07:48,370 --> 02:07:51,081
I mean, you didn't exactly
ask me out...

1695
02:07:53,250 --> 02:07:55,752
... but you did say you loved me...

1696
02:07:56,044 --> 02:07:58,755
...so I'm thinking I've got a date.

1697
02:07:59,256 --> 02:08:00,423
If you'll have me.

1698
02:08:03,051 --> 02:08:05,011
I have the girls New Year's Eve.

1699
02:08:07,973 --> 02:08:09,182
Sounds perfect.

1700
02:08:28,618 --> 02:08:30,662
I'm coming to get you!

1701
02:08:30,829 --> 02:08:35,250
You look just like an angel
on the top of the Christmas tree.

1702
02:08:35,417 --> 02:08:37,919
You got so big. Give us a kiss.

1703
02:08:38,336 --> 02:08:41,214
Come and tell me all about
your Christmas presents.

1704
02:08:41,715 --> 02:08:43,049
Go sit with Miles.

1705
02:08:52,809 --> 02:08:53,810
Sweetie.

1706
02:09:30,597 --> 02:09:33,558
- I challenge ye.
- Me?

1707
02:09:54,204 --> 02:09:56,373
The love train
is leaving the station.

1708
02:10:11,054 --> 02:10:13,264
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

1709
02:10:13,431 --> 02:10:15,517
Happy New Year!

1710
02:10:15,684 --> 02:10:19,688
Happy New Year, everybody!
