1
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,007
Wait here.

2
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,370
He told me to wait outside.

3
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,336
Let's go.

4
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,881
Why are you two still breathing?

5
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,466
We arrived after...

6
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,228
So I make sure I understand.

7
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,898
You came here.

8
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,984
Alone.

9
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,737
To this vineyard, in Sicily.

10
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,281
For?

11
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,619
You know who I am, then?

12
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,750
Yet you came anyway.

13
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:20,921
Why?

14
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,600
How did you find me?

15
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,519
No one ever has.

16
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,233
Okay.

17
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,528
Okay.

18
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,656
Here you are.

19
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,828
Except you're a few meters short...

20
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,665
of what you came for.

21
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,548
We all end up where we're supposed to be.

22
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,195
Stop, stop, stop.

23
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,241
It's only you?

24
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,495
Okay, good.

25
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,748
Stay in the truck, son.

26
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,953
The blood pressure is very low.
He wouldn't have made it to the hospital.

27
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:25,870
He's about to go into shock.

28
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,503
Take a blanket and put it on his legs.

29
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,176
Mind the light. Thank you.

30
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,011
Thank you. That's good.

31
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,434
- Gio.
- Yes.

32
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,852
This man fell down.

33
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,398
He didn't fall. They shot him.

34
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,693
You brought me a man that fell down. Okay?

35
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,574
- Clean his wound here.
- Yes.

36
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,504
Lucky it was only a .22 caliber.

37
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,265
Gio saved your life.

38
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,350
So I ask...

39
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,602
did he save a good man?

40
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,187
Or a bad man?

41
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,362
Where are you headed?

42
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,406
Home.

43
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,372
Not so fast now.

44
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,127
Your wound...

45
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,421
it needs time to heal.

46
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,555
Will the bad men come looking for you?

47
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,431
Where am I?

48
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,307
Go slowly, okay?

49
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,213
Khalid, bring me the red snappers.

50
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,339
Coming.

51
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,872
Good morning.

52
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,708
A tea?

53
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,797
The tea bag.

54
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,048
Tea bag.

55
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,008
I'll bring it right away.

56
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,317
I'm sorry,
but tea is for old ladies and Englishmen.

57
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:21,846
Good morning.

58
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,313
Good morning, Aminah.

59
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,358
Gabby, I have
a small something for you. Come.

60
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,029
Go slowly.

61
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,252
Dad, Mum is calling you from the kitchen.

62
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,801
Your salad.

63
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:17,677
Enjoy it.

64
00:27:58,594 --> 00:27:59,594
My name is Aminah.

65
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,015
Nice to meet you.

66
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:17,863
Excuse me, sir.

67
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,448
This shirt would look good on you!

68
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,700
This shirt is perfect.

69
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:22,826
It's your color.

70
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,119
With these pants.

71
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:25,203
What do you think?

72
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,245
Perfect outfit.

73
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:31,084
Okay, only one shirt,
but with the right pants.

74
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:32,085
Only one for me.

75
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,463
And the hat,
because it matches the shirt.

76
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,797
They are the same color.

77
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:39,593
Okay?

78
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:09,122
Marco, I needed to repair the freezer.
I have no business without it.

79
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,124
And what do I care about the freezer?

80
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,502
I'll pay you next week. Don't worry.

81
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,421
Come on, Angelo, give me the money.

82
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,932
Angelo, everyone must pay.

83
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,483
We've known each other
for a long time, right?

84
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,075
See you next week.

85
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,869
There is no problem, Angelo.
Really no problem.

86
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,585
Calm down. Good boy.

87
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,380
Pull yourself together.

88
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,979
Come on, let's go. Come on!

89
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,450
Khalid, let's get back to work.

90
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:36,459
Angelo!

91
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,628
Next week.

92
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,672
Don't piss me off.

93
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,052
Wait here.

94
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,889
Where's my brother?

95
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,766
Upstairs dealing with something.

96
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,895
These are the waivers. Sign them.

97
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,416
You cannot throw people
out of their homes. Do you understand?

98
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,608
These people don't know where to go.

99
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,609
Lucia.

100
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,782
Mr. Quaranta.

101
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,830
We cannot sign these papers.

102
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:38,539
Okay?

103
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,043
A court will decide.

104
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:47,048
And maybe you'll have
to find another building for your hotel.

105
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:50,677
I really hope you understand.

106
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,555
Thank you for your time.

107
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,834
Got a new car?

108
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,044
How's the new kid doing?

109
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,087
Good. He listens to me.

110
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,381
He'll be a good one.

111
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,302
Get everyone out.

112
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,182
So?

113
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,479
- I look out for you, don't I?
- Yes.

114
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,356
You're my brother and I love you,

115
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,857
but don't piss me off.

116
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,194
Make collections. Don't be loud about it.

117
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,656
I have more important issues.

118
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:56,201
Why don't you make me part
of these important things?

119
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,328
These are big ones.

120
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,172
Stay in your place.

121
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,134
You do what you do.

122
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,513
I have big plans for you.

123
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,889
Really?

124
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,349
Don't worry.

125
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,067
Leave him there,

126
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,069
for everyone to see.

127
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,407
Quick! Come on. Move it.

128
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,118
Quickly! Come on.

129
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,550
You're not supposed to smell the fish.

130
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,283
Look at the eyes.

131
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,578
Eyes are bright. Not cloudy.

132
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:05,455
Gills red or pink.

133
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:07,873
She's right.

134
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,127
I see Stefano finally sold that hat.

135
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,761
I like the hat. I like it.

136
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,140
- Two?
- How much is it?

137
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:27,852
Today you don't have to pay.
You are a friend of Enzo. You don't pay.

138
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,439
No. You are a friend of Enzo.

139
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,613
Enzo's friend, I can't let you pay.

140
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,116
Next time, I promise I'll let you pay.

141
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,660
Come on, Khalid, let's give him his fish.

142
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,648
Brother.

143
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,109
Been praying?

144
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:28,361
I don't think God is listening.

145
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:29,821
What's up?

146
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:34,117
It's time, little brother,
to help me with bigger issues.

147
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:40,039
I need you to put more pressure
on this town, these people.

148
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,919
We have big plans for Altamonte,
resorts, hotels, casinos.

149
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,172
You know what's to be done.

150
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,217
Sure, Vincent.

151
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:57,015
This entire coast will be ours soon.

152
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,642
All of it.

153
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,900
Calm, calm.

154
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,488
Calm down, Angelo. We're here to help you.

155
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,079
They destroyed all we have.

156
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:06,912
Hello, good morning.

157
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,957
Marshal Bonucci, Altamonte Carabinieri.

158
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:15,171
I need information...

159
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,257
on the owner of a van...

160
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:19,758
Ford...

161
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,638
blue or black.

162
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,890
Suspicion of arson.

163
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,103
Good for tea.

164
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:10,354
Hello?

165
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,272
<i>Your daughter left school early.</i>

166
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:14,607
Who is this?

167
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,610
Miss Marta.

168
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,321
Have you seen Gabby?

169
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:21,657
One of your officers picked her up
a while ago.

170
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:26,495
Is everything all right?

171
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,579
Daddy, Daddy.

172
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:11,206
He made a dumb mistake. Right?

173
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,625
He made a call he wasn't supposed to.

174
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,754
Stop!

175
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,671
I beg you!

176
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,967
You don't think we have friends there?

177
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,890
Why do you need to be difficult,
Carabiniere?

178
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,018
You know you shouldn't make trouble.

179
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,773
- Viking! Grab the kid, quick.
- I'm eating.

180
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,441
Who gives a shit you're eating.

181
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,027
Sure, we should all wait
for the Viking to finish eating!

182
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,403
Move it!

183
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:43,489
This will teach you a lesson.

184
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:44,865
Come on, bring her here.

185
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,450
Look at me!

186
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:55,042
Next time we'll hurt the little girl.

187
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,877
Or we do something worse. Got it?

188
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,545
We do something worse!

189
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:00,631
- Let her go!
- You shut up!

190
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:09,807
Good Carabiniere.

191
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,596
Hi, Marshal.

192
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,516
How are you?

193
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:08,313
What a pretty girl you are.

194
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,065
Remember me?

195
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:15,028
How's your head, Marshal? Does it hurt?

196
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,743
Don't worry, okay?

197
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:27,582
Marshal, listen,

198
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,835
I need a favor from you.

199
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:33,505
I need you to go to the Somalis...

200
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,299
and ask them for their boats.

201
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,051
Can you do that?

202
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,889
Sure, you can do that.

203
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:46,309
You're my message boy now, Marshal.
Bravo, Marshal!

204
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:28,536
Did you get what he said?

205
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:31,164
He's getting ready. He's fun!

206
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:51,309
Sit down.

207
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:52,394
Sit!

208
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:31,558
Go away! Go away, now!

209
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,418
Slowly.

210
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:36,039
Get the van.

211
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:42,962
This fucking American.

212
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:44,839
He meddles.

213
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,760
Give me the cigarette.

214
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:57,143
What do you want to do, Marco?

215
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:00,855
I'm gonna execute that motherfucker.

216
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:05,068
And Vincent?

217
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,198
Fuck Vincent.

218
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,785
He doesn't tell me what to do.

219
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,373
Let's go. Give me your gun.

220
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:20,500
Give me the gun. Understand?

221
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:46,127
We found packages in the back of the van.

222
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,006
Some kind of drug.

223
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,261
Not the usual.

224
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:04,854
Gonna send some techs down here
to go through it.

225
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,851
<i>That the explosion at the train station</i>

226
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:46,938
<i>is the result
of an as-yet-unclaimed terrorist attack.</i>

227
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:49,274
<i>At the moment there are no suspects.</i>

228
01:08:57,842 --> 01:08:59,802
We are at your disposal.

229
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:05,952
You interrupted my breakfast.

230
01:12:19,794 --> 01:12:21,671
I'm sorry about your brother.

231
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:25,298
Thank you.

232
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:28,552
Take a seat.

233
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:40,189
There is a matter
that I have to talk to you about.

234
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:42,148
Not today.

235
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:44,735
The CIA arrived.

236
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:49,365
They are looking for a terrorist cell
importing a jihad drug

237
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:50,867
and selling it across the EU.

238
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:53,619
Then take care of it.

239
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:55,773
You need to shut everything down.

240
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:58,916
There is a woman...

241
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,209
she's smart.

242
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:05,798
She'll figure out
that it wasn't the terrorists...

243
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:09,594
but it was you.

244
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:11,845
The Camorra...

245
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:15,057
buying drugs from the enemy...

246
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:20,646
and selling them on our own streets
to finance your enterprises.

247
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,565
You have to do your job.

248
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:28,237
Did you see what they did
with the money you paid them?

249
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:32,617
Did you see how many people died
in that train station attack?

250
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:37,955
Our people.

251
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:40,666
If I wasn't buying their drugs...

252
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:42,960
somebody else would have...

253
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:46,213
and the same people would be dead.

254
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:50,968
I'll take care of the woman.

255
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,346
You make sure nothing touches me.

256
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:55,723
So you understood nothing.

257
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:57,934
Nothing.

258
01:13:58,017 --> 01:13:59,310
You're right.

259
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:02,146
I don't give a shit.

260
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:06,108
My brother is dead
and you're here talking about bullshit.

261
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:08,361
Without any information.

262
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:12,406
Are you stupid?

263
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:15,743
Or have you forgotten your place?

264
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:23,042
My place...

265
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:26,128
is head of the police.

266
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:30,383
Did you forget who you are?

267
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,344
You were a barbarian...

268
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:41,310
and a barbarian you'll always be.

269
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:42,394
I warned you.

270
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,605
- Where are you going?
- Stay here.

271
01:14:51,112 --> 01:14:54,073
You must find who killed my brother.
Piece of shit! Understood?

272
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:02,331
Shut up!

273
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:05,501
Now my barbarians will bring you
to the hospital.

274
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:09,380
Hurry up and maybe one day
you'll wiggle a couple of fingers.

275
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:47,043
Did you get my message?

276
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:50,796
Next time I'll take your head
and mail it to your grandchildren.

277
01:15:51,422 --> 01:15:53,799
Appreciate you giving us
a hand on this, Barella.

278
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:55,926
Let's go, Antonio.

279
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:42,551
My brother was murdered on your streets!

280
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:45,095
Bring me who did it...

281
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:47,473
and I will reward you!

282
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:04,031
You know who did it.

283
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:08,369
Tell me who killed my brother!

284
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:21,340
Next time it'll be more than your ear.

285
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:38,315
How many will I kill today?

286
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:41,277
Say who killed my brother...

287
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:45,656
or I'll kill your family while you watch.

288
01:21:22,336 --> 01:21:24,505
You don't have to do this, my son.

289
01:21:51,532 --> 01:21:54,284
- Really?
- Vincent.

290
01:21:54,368 --> 01:21:55,911
Then shoot me too!

291
01:21:55,994 --> 01:21:57,538
Then kill me!

292
01:22:01,041 --> 01:22:03,627
We gotta go.
They're recording us, Vincent.

293
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:06,588
Let her go.

294
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:29,361
I'll kill you all!

295
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:31,405
Boss, we've got to go.
The police are coming.

296
01:22:33,824 --> 01:22:34,992
Let's go!

297
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:14,281
What do we know about the American?

298
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:16,574
Nothing.

299
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:18,368
No one is talking.

300
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:20,913
We checked also with our contacts but...

301
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:21,996
nothing.

302
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:24,457
No one is talking?

303
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:28,420
Could be FBI, the CIA...

304
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:30,672
Interpol...

305
01:23:31,465 --> 01:23:32,966
We don't know, Vincent.

306
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:39,306
What if it's one of our enemies,
one of the other families?

307
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:45,437
We will kill the American.

308
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:49,399
We will kill the American,
we will burn that fucking place!

309
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:51,108
Tomorrow, Simone.

310
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:53,027
Tomorrow.

311
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:04,326
What the fuck?

312
01:26:06,036 --> 01:26:07,036
Go check.

313
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:16,462
Nothing.

314
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:19,174
There's no one there.

315
01:31:31,903 --> 01:31:33,488
We all have to face...

316
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:37,367
Death.
