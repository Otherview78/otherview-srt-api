He's coming in.

10

He's coming in. Let's go, let's go.

11
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:31,968
- Tires!
- Let's go, let's go.

12
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,302
I know you're tired, but come on,

13
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:34,303
let's make this fast.

14
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:35,721
Move, move, move!

15
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:39,308
She's running a little hot,
but we're good.

16
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:40,935
Tires are still gripping.

17
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,228
Fire! The fuel! Fire!

18
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,854
- Shelby, it's you!
- Grab that blanket!

19
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,400
Get off me! Off!

20
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,028
You okay?

21
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:54,865
Fill the tank!

22
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:58,619
- Shelby, you just--
- Am I on fire?

23
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,123
Am I on goddamn fire?

24
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:03,624
- No, you're not on fire.
- Fill the damn tank!

25
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:04,959
- Fill the tank.
- Fill the tank.

26
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,085
Get it ready!

27
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,463
- Where am I, Eddie?
- Two laps up, my friend.

28
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:10,548
Car's yours.

29
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,008
Go get 'em.

Carroll Shelby.

40
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:54,633
What?

41
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:56,886
This is something
you can't ignore anymore.

42
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,138
Oh, I take the pills. The pills work.

43
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:03,059
An elevated
heart rate, say 130 BPM,

44
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,311
sustained even for a short period,

45
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,313
you run a critical risk of cardiac arrest.

46
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,648
- Well, I'll race shorter format then.
- That's not gonna work.

47
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:12,318
Well, I could race NASCAR. Formula One.

48
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,362
The valve is shot, Shelby.

49
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,572
This is as serious as it gets.

50
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,908
In my opinion, you're lucky
to be sitting here today.

51
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:21,952
Well, I feel real lucky.

52
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,039
Luckiest guy on Earth.

53
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:49,146
<i>There's a point at 7,000 RPM
where everything fades.</i>

54
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,699
<i>The machine becomes weightless.</i>

55
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,118
<i>Just disappears.</i>

56
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:04,787
Hey!

57
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,747
Watch it, buddy!

58
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,881
<i>And all that's left is a body
moving through space and time.</i>

59
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,764
<i>7,000 RPM.</i>

60
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:26,851
<i>That's where you meet it.</i>

61
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:32,356
<i>It asks you a question.</i>

62
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,817
<i>The only question that matters.</i>

63
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,780
<i>"Who are you?"</i>

64
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:50,040
Now, it's von Trips in the Ferrari,
coming into the corkscrew.

65
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,042
- He's braking late.
- Hey, I called you three times,

66
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,294
and you never answer the phone.

67
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:54,587
Oh! He sets a new lap record!

68
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:55,921
I answer the phone
every time it rings.

69
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:57,423
- No, sir, you do not.
- Yes, I do.

70
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,424
No, you don't.

71
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,509
A month ago, this car was fine.

72
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:04,805
Now, it won't even start.
And when it does,

73
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,140
it's, "Boom, boom, boom!"

74
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,684
When I pull out of the driveway,

75
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,228
the dog has a heart attack.

76
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,272
All I'm asking is for
you to make it like it was.

77
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:16,984
Yeah, you've coked up
the inlet valves and the plugs.

78
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,277
Nothing wrong with the car,

79
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,403
just the way it's being driven.

80
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,571
The way it's being driven?

81
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,948
Too much fuel, not enough spark.
That's what's making her misfire.

82
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:24,408
You wanna run that by me in English?

83
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:27,912
All right, sir.

84
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,290
So...

85
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,585
That there, that is a sport car.

86
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,754
You have to drive her like a sport car.

87
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,631
If you drive her like a school teacher,

88
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,090
she'll clog up. All right?

89
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,552
Try changing up at 5,000 RPM, not two.

90
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:47,640
Drive like you mean it. Hard and tight.

91
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:49,058
She'll run clean.

92
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,853
Are you telling me I don't know
how to drive my own car?

93
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,189
No.

94
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,191
But if you ask me, this isn't your car.

95
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,986
Your car's more a Plymouth
or a Studebaker.

96
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:04,240
You and me have a problem, buddy?

97
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,159
I don't have a problem. I had an MG.

98
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:08,619
Mine ran just fine.

99
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,246
Screw you, you limey prick.

100
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:11,580
I want my money back.

101
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:13,958
Oh, behave. I'd give it to ya.

102
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,377
But you haven't paid
for last month's service yet.

103
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,587
This country, the customer's always right.

104
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:19,838
You ever hear of that?

105
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,132
Yeah. Yeah.

106
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,676
Utter nonsense.

107
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,470
Now remember, I advanced the timing,

108
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:29,557
so a smidge twitchy in first.

109
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,518
Get the revs up. Good lad. Revs up.

110
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,521
Ta-ra.

111
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:39,900
Another satisfied customer?

112
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,446
Can I help you, miss?

113
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,367
Wasn't that an MGA 1500?

114
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,705
Ah, you know your cars.

115
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,164
Well, I like them.

116
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,375
I love the sound they make.

117
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,043
The way it goes right through you.

118
00:06:58,419 --> 00:06:59,336
Right.

119
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:01,922
That vibration.

120
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:07,886
Mine's the wood-paneled

121
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,930
Country Squire...

122
00:07:10,014 --> 00:07:11,515
Across the street.

123
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:15,060
A real hot rod.

124
00:07:15,144 --> 00:07:16,270
Oh, yeah?

125
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:18,272
- Is it fast?
- Very.

126
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,774
Wait a second. What type of girl are ya?

127
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:23,902
Type of girl who likes
the smell of wet gasoline.

128
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,404
- Oh.
- Burnt rubber.

129
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,741
Oh, what, are you some kind of a deviant,
are ya?

130
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,868
Well, only since I married you.

131
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,336
Hey, Gar, what's going on?

132
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,420
Something's up.

133
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,256
Hi, Lee.

134
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,508
Listen, he isn't as sure as you are
about the banks.

135
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:49,845
I'm not as sure about this...

136
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,556
How's this going out?

137
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,187
- Don, what's going on?
- I don't know.

138
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,066
- Mr. Ford, welcome to the room.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Ford.

139
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,275
Nice to see you, sir.

140
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:09,948
Shut it down, Mr. Beebe.

141
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:17,915
John!

142
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:24,171
All stop.

143
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,475
Hear that?

144
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:43,315
That's the sound
of the Ford Motor Company...

145
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,901
out of business.

146
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:56,912
In 1899, my grandfather,
Henry, by God, Ford...

147
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:00,541
was walking home from Edison Illumination

148
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,835
after working a double shift.

149
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,336
He was ruminating.

150
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:09,883
That morning, he had himself an idea
that changed the world.

151
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:15,806
Sixty-five years
and 47 million automobiles later,

152
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,725
what shall be his legacy?

153
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,397
Getting it in the tail pipe
from a Chevy Impala.

154
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,945
Here's what I want you to do.

155
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,613
Walk home.

156
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:38,954
While you're walking,
I want you to ruminate.

157
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,791
Man comes to my office with an idea,

158
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,335
that man keeps his job.

159
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:49,006
Rest of you second-best losers...

160
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,258
stay home.

161
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,177
You don't belong at Ford.

162
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,356
Shelby!

163
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:10,319
I see you. Up and at 'em, buddy.

164
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,615
- Hey!
- Go away.

165
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,575
Come on. You can do it.

166
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,536
Come on, baby.

167
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,872
8:30 a.m., time to roll.

168
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:22,956
Let's go.

169
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,709
- Let's go. Let's go, go, go.
- Go away.

170
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:28,045
It's 8:30 a.m., baby. Time to roll.

171
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,672
Come on.

172
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,758
Hey, Phil.

173
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:33,842
Hey, Bob.

174
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,177
Is Shelby here?

175
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,054
Uh, it's touch and go.

176
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,312
Shelby, you're up bright and early.

177
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:48,482
Well, early bird gets the worm, Pops.

00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,321

00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,324
Well, you got Red Farts and Bill Rushton.

181
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,909
They're all in 327s.

182
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,619
Corvettes. What about Bondurant?

183
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,329
Bondurant? Well, he's still driving...

184
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,498
- Mr. Shelby, can I get an autograph?
- ...for Washburn.

185
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,750
Number 614.

186
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,378
- Thank you so much.
- All right, just relax. All right.

187
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,380
We're gonna eat those Vettes
for breakfast.

188
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,923
We're lighter, we're faster,

189
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,633
and that don't work, we're nastier.

190
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,219
<i>Hey, Dad,
before the race starts,</i>

191
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,137
<i>take your son over
to the Willow Springs...</i>

192
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,182
Hey, Phil. Hey,
take it easy on us today, bud.

193
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,563
You all right?

194
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:30,649
Paragraph 15.4,
section 2b of the SCCA standard

195
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,110
dictates all AF class cars must have

196
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,737
minimum trunk space
of 20 inches by 12 inches

197
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:36,947
by six inches.

198
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,949
Your trunk doesn't close.

199
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,285
- Ergo car fails standard.
- Wait, wait, wait. What?

200
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,787
Ergo car is disqualified
from said Class A competition.

201
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,498
No, no, no. Look, look, look.
Can I ask you a question, all right?

202
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:49,334
When you were a little boy, did you think,

203
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:53,714
"When I grow up, I want to go
to the fabled Willow Springs Raceway,

204
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,550
"and I want to enforce
paragraph 15.4, section 2b

205
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,219
of the SCCA regulations
on luggage capacity"?

206
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:00,888
- All right, that's it.
- Did you?

207
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:04,099
I'm ruling you and your team
disqualified from this race.

208
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,769
Ah, well,
if it isn't Lance Reventlow.

209
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,730
- Ah, Shelby.
- How you doing, Lance?

210
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:10,898
- Pops.
- Hey, Lance.

211
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:13,775
Allow me to introduce Dieter Voss.
Runs Brumos Porsche out of Jacksonville.

212
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,569
Oh, I know all about Mr. Voss.

213
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,988
You're having a hell of a
season with that Abarth, sir.

214
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,865
Seeing results for your Cobra, too.

215
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,909
- Thank you.
- Your guy Miles is impressive.

216
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,660
- Oh, you following Miles?
- Oh, yes.

217
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,538
Well, he was a USAC
road racing champ in '61.

218
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:27,998
He won the Pikes Peak Hill Climb.

219
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,792
He was SCCA C-class champion
three years in a row

220
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:33,003
in his piece-of-shit MG he built himself.

221
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,880
We heard he's, uh, difficult.

222
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,965
What, Ken? No, no. Ken's a puppy dog.

223
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:39,134
Hey, Lance, tell the man.
You've raced against Ken.

224
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,678
Oh, I've driven more
behind him than against him.

225
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:46,767
Well, Brumos is looking for a driver
for our number two car at Sebring.

226
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,477
- Is that right?
- How is that even possible?

227
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,228
Think your guy Miles can make the grade?

228
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,105
- Oh, well, Ken...
- Is he, mate? Hey!

229
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,108
Jim! Is he putting his bloody carryall

230
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,401
- in your trunk?
- What?

231
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,611
Discretionary infraction.

232
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,112
Gentlemen, excuse me a moment.

233
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,574
To be honest, Ken was born for Sebring.

234
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,789
Nothing in there about my trunk
and your lovely little portmanteau.

235
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:12,042
You're holding
the '62 edition of the SCCA.

236
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:18,006
And you can stick this bloody sticker
where the sun don't shine.

237
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,967
Hey. Hey, Bill. What seems
to be the problem, Bill?

238
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,678
The problem is that
Bill here is an arsehole.

239
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,097
- No, he doesn't mean that.
- Oh, yes, he does. Yes, he does.

240
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,848
- No, he really does think...
- He's just fooling with ya, Bill.

241
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,684
- That Bill is an arsehole.
- He's just foolin'.

242
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,644
- I'm just doing my job here.
- Hang on. Bill, Bill, Bill.

243
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,854
In my experience, there is...
Listen to me.

244
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:34,648
Something like this, there's
always a middle ground.

245
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,816
All right? Now, Ken's outta line.

246
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:36,900
And I'm just doing my job.

247
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:37,985
I understand you are.

248
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,069
You know how he gets on a race day.

249
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,278
You know that. All right?

250
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,905
But you're not gonna DQ us over a trunk.

251
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,998
- What?
- You see that guy?

252
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,165
Got his tail up.

253
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:00,549
Happy, Bill?

254
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,928
Bill, I'll handle it.
I'll talk to him.

255
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,472
I'll talk to him. You just go
and have a great day.

256
00:14:07,556 --> 00:14:09,599
<i>Hey, folks, feeling hungry?</i>

257
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:11,309
<i>Head on over to the snack bar...</i>

258
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,644
Shit.

259
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,521
- Bulldog.
- Huh?

260
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,774
You know who that was
I was just talking to?

261
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:18,900
Bill.

262
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:20,318
- Before that.
- No.

263
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,237
It was Dieter Voss.

264
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,405
Who's that?

265
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,408
He runs Porsche, Ken.

266
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,410
It's a little German car company.
Maybe you heard of it.

267
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,578
All right.

268
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,121
He wanted you to drive at Sebring.

269
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,789
But he'd heard you were difficult.

270
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:43,258
I thought we felt the same way
about, uh, Germans.

271
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:49,306
Do you like losing, Ken?

272
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,309
Excuse me?

273
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:53,685
Oh, you heard me.

274
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:55,854
I don't lose.

275
00:14:56,897 --> 00:15:00,358
Without sponsors, you get no car, Ken.

276
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,110
And last I checked, the professionals

277
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:03,862
- all have a car.
- Shel!

278
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,156
You cannot win the SCCA without one.

279
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,158
If you're not winning, you are losing.

280
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,410
Don't make me lamp this at your head.

281
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:11,787
Did you bring your son
all the way out here

282
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,038
to watch you get disqualified

283
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,498
or just act like a jackass?

284
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,961
Damn!

285
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,758
Well, that answers that.

286
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,903
Peter...

287
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,789
May I help you, gentlemen?

288
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,374
Uh, yes, is Ken Miles here?

289
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,252
- No.
- We need to speak to Mr. Miles.

290
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:01,586
I'm his wife.

291
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,465
<i>Welcome to the 1963
Willow Springs 100.</i>

292
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:08,510
<i>Twelve cars will be competing
in this 40-lap race.</i>

293
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,805
Hey, Ken, what happened to your shield?

294
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,724
New design.

295
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,936
<i>Well, it looks
like we're about to begin.</i>

296
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,980
<i>The cars have completed their warm-up lap.</i>

297
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,523
<i>The green flag is out...</i>

298
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:25,068
<i>and they're approaching the starting line.</i>

299
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:26,862
Here we go.

300
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:30,907
Oh, bloody hell.

301
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:36,079
<i>Ken Miles has fallen behind.</i>

302
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,373
Learn to drive, you pillock!

303
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,797
So, Shelby, do you miss it?

304
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,676
Hey, Sam.

305
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:53,972
Guy wins the 24-hour Le Mans,
suddenly retires,

306
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:55,932
starts selling cars.

307
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,518
It just don't make sense.

308
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,645
Well, unless the rumors
are true, of course.

309
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,148
Oh, what rumors would those be, Sam?

310
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:06,818
That Carroll Shelby quit driving
'cause he lost his nerve.

311
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,577
I'm gonna out-brake you
on the next turn, Bob.

312
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:29,216
Ha-ha! Nice try, Bob.

313
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,526
<i>Nice move from Ken Miles.</i>

314
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,571
<i>Twenty-two laps remaining,
with Phil Hill and Dan Gurney in the lead.</i>

315
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,555
<i>It's been an incredible day
here at Willow Springs,</i>

316
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,516
<i>and we've seen some exciting driving.</i>

317
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:23,186
<i>With just one lap remaining
in this 40-lap race,</i>

318
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,063
<i>we're coming to the final stretch.</i>

319
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:27,774
<i>Dan Gurney has been leading
the pack for most of the...</i>

320
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,317
<i>Whoa!</i>

321
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,113
<i>Number 18, Red Farts,
is off the track.</i>

322
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:37,117
<i>That leaves Dan Gurney for the lead
followed by journey man Ken Miles.</i>

323
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,037
Now for you, Dan.

324
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,295
<i>And they're
coming around the last turn.</i>

325
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:51,256
<i>Gurney is still in the lead
with Ken Miles hot on his heels.</i>

326
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:00,724
<i>Miles is looking for an opening.</i>

327
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:01,725
Not yet.

328
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:03,643
Come on.

329
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,771
<i>Can Gurney hold
him off in the final straight?</i>

330
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:07,814
Not yet.

331
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,193
<i>Gurney is blocking him out.</i>

332
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,236
Now.

333
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:18,742
<i>Miles goes for the shoulder.</i>

334
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:19,826
Nice move, Ken.

335
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:25,582
<i>They're wheel to wheel.</i>

336
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,083
Come on.

337
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,170
<i>It's Corvette versus Cobra
for the finish.</i>

338
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,799
Yeah! Ha-ha!

339
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:35,967
Yeah!

340
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,179
<i>An incredible
finish for Ken Miles.</i>

341
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,682
<i>Didn't see that one coming.</i>

342
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,435
He's difficult but good.

343
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,146
<i>Let's give everyone a hand
for one heck of a race.</i>

344
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,899
That calls for a nice cup of tea.

345
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,525
I'll put the kettle on.

346
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,526

I'm sure I am I'm H-A-P-P-Y</i> ♪

351
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:11,836
Pops, frame this.

352
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,225
Hey.

353
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:28,144
We did it.

354
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:31,856
What's wrong?

355
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,151
The IRS came.

356
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,487
They've padlocked the garage.

357
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,452
All right, Petey.

358
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,800
A couple of years ago...

359
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,553
you said we'd a nest egg.

360
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:03,263
Correct.

361
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,224
A couple of years ago.

362
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,475
Correct.

363
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,774
So just to be clear, we are buggered.

364
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,860
Absolutely.

365
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,868
As in totally?

366
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,790
As in, not a bean,
or a pot in which to piss.

367
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:33,751
Spares, stock, all gone.

368
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:36,087
Tools. My tools are locked up in there.

369
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,382
I'll figure something out.

370
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:42,719
<i>In 1945...</i>

371
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,679
our soldiers came home.

372
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,557
What was the first thing that they did?

373
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:51,394
They had sex.

374
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:53,646
Seventeen years later,

375
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,857
those babies, they've grown.

376
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,192
And they've got jobs.

377
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:58,860
They've got licenses.

378
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:03,198
But they do not wanna drive
the same dull '50s cars

379
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,616
their parents drove.

380
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:07,994
You see, kids today, they want glamour.

381
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,330
They want sex appeal.

382
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:11,372
They want to go fast.

383
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,291
Gentlemen...

384
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:17,295
it's time for the Ford Motor Company
to go racing.

385
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,257
We're already in racing, lacocca.

386
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,176
NASCAR?

387
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,345
It's... it's regional, sir.

388
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:29,098
If you go to the movies,
you open up a magazine,

389
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:31,518
you don't see good ol' boys
and Winston-Salem.

390
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,019
You see, uh...

391
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,396
Sophia Loren...

392
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:37,857
Monica Vitti.

393
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:39,359
Hello!

394
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:44,030
James Bond does not drive a Ford, sir.

395
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,449
That's because he's a degenerate.

396
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:51,329
See?

397
00:22:51,955 --> 00:22:53,289
God, I'd like to be a degenerate.

398
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:55,750
Um, just give me one second here, sir.

399
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:56,960
Is this part of it?

400
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,546
Is this going anywhere, lacocca?

401
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:00,797
Just a second, sir.

402
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,965
All right, all right,
that's enough.

403
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:03,007
Sir, if you just bear with me...

404
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:04,092
Turn it off. Lights.

405
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:13,977
Lee, in the last three years,
you and your marketing team...

406
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:18,856
have presided over the worst
sales slump in US history.

407
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:24,028
Why exactly should Mr. Ford listen to you?

408
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:28,866
Because we've been thinking wrong.

409
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,413
Ferrari.

410
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:37,041
Now, they have won four
out of the last five Le Mans.

411
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:40,461
We need to think like Ferrari.

412
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:45,592
Ferrari makes fewer cars
in a year than we make in a day.

413
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:48,511
We spend more on toilet paper

414
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,888
than they do on their entire output.

415
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,850
You want us to think like them?

416
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,810
Enzo Ferrari will go down in history

417
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,979
as the greatest
car manufacturer of all time.

418
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,481
Why?

419
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:04,402
Is it because he built the most cars?

420
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:07,405
No.

421
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:10,283
It's because of what his cars mean.

422
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:12,785
Victory.

423
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:15,204
Ferrari wins at Le Mans.

424
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:18,082
People, they, they want
some of that victory.

425
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:23,880
What if the Ford badge meant victory?

426
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:25,882
And meant it where it counts,

427
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,343
with the first group
of 17-year-olds in history

428
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:29,761
with money in their pockets?

429
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,429
This would take years.

430
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:33,973
Decades to test and develop...

431
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:37,393
a race team capable of taking out Ferrari.

432
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:38,811
Ferrari's bankrupt.

433
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,901
Enzo has spent every lira
he's got chasing perfection,

434
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,152
and you know something?

435
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,487
He got there.

436
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,405
But now he's broke.

437
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:16,683
You don't have to give up racing
to get a bloody day job, Ken.

438
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:17,809
I think I do.

439
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:19,102
Now, I've had my fun.

440
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:21,187
It's time to put food on the table...

441
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,313
and grow up.

442
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:23,648
The garage didn't pay the bills.

443
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:24,899
Now it's locked up.

444
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:26,526
Racing doesn't pay them either,

445
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:27,694
and I keep winning.

446
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:29,153
Yeah, because you're good.

447
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:31,531
But I can't play the game.

448
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:34,367
I'm not what they call a people person.

449
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,494
- You don't say.
- And I'm 45 years old.

450
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,079
Do you really think I'm gonna change?

451
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,998
I'm never gonna get the good rise.

452
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:42,250
I started too late.

453
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,835
Because you fought in the bloody war.

454
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:48,923
If you stop,
you'll be bloody insufferable.

455
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:53,302
Let's quit going round
the Wrekin. It's over.

456
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,722
Let's look on the bright side.

457
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:59,559
Now I can get fat and old,
trim the roses, and eat pork pies.

458
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:21,956
Uh, <i>scusa.</i>

459
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:23,916
Please, no photos.

460
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,168
<i>Prego.</i>

461
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,961
- Relax, will you?
- You gotta understand.

462
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:30,214
This is like the Mafia showing up
to buy the Statue of Liberty.

463
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:31,549
Kind of the opposite, actually.

464
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,886
The press gets wind of this,
the shit will hit the Fangio.

465
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,472
Lee lacocca, Ford Motor.

466
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:39,182
Franco Gozzi, Ferrari.

467
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:42,769
Journalists?

468
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:44,687
No, no, Mr. lacocca, no.

469
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,272
It's our cameras.

470
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,565
Just for history.

471
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,695
Four-liter Colombo engine.

472
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:58,075
One man assembles the entire engine
by himself.

473
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:02,830
Another man assembles the transmission.

474
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:05,416
Everything hand-built.

475
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:07,919
<i>Bellissimo.</i>

476
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,059
Racing Department.

477
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:26,896
Lee. That's him.

478
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,780
This merger between our companies
will form two entities.

479
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:42,328
Ford-Ferrari,
90 percent owned by Ford,

480
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,704
who controls all production.

481
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,213
Secondly, Ferrari-Ford, the race team,

482
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:53,965
90 percent owned by Ferrari.

483
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:03,391
In order to secure this,
Ford will pay the sum...

484
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:32,670
Excuse me.

485
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:39,719
He will need
some time to read this.

486
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:41,220
Ah. Please.

487
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:45,850
Ah. Yeah, of course.

488
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,122
I'm looking for the chairman of Fiat!

489
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:10,082
Agnelli!

490
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:13,002
I have photographs for you to see.

491
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,048
<i>Grazie, grazie, grazie.</i>

492
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:21,344
<i>Pronto.</i>

493
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,346
<i>Pronto.</i>

494
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:24,472
Yes, I am here.

495
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:29,060
Do you have something to say?

496
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:32,355
Enzo maintains full control.

497
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,108
I get the company for 18 million.

498
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,529
All done, thank you.

499
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:58,464
"Gentlemen,
only one small question.

500
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,632
It concerns my race program."

501
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:12,061
"if I wish to race Le Mans,

502
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,021
"and you do not wish
for me to race Le Mans...

503
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,232
do we or do we not go?"

504
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:28,077
Look, in that highly unlikely scenario...

505
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:31,497
if we just can't agree...

506
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:33,874
then, yes. I mean, no.

507
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,544
You are correct.

508
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,629
You do not go.

509
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:58,399
"My integrity as a constructor,

510
00:30:58,482 --> 00:30:59,859
"as a man, as an Italian,

511
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:01,569
is deeply insulted by your proposal."

512
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,780
"Go back to Michigan."

513
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,078
"Back to your big, ugly factory."

514
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:14,999
"Back to your big, ugly factory,

515
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:16,292
making its ugly, little cars."

516
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:25,885
"Tell your pigheaded boss that

517
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:30,973
all his, uh, smug executives
are worthless sons of whores."

518
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:36,228
Tell him he's not Henry Ford.

519
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,649
He's Henry Ford ll.

520
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:45,154
I'm starving. Let's go eat.

521
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:09,637
He played us.

522
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,932
Old Man Enzo had no intention
of selling to us.

523
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:16,685
He used us to up his price...

524
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,855
embarrass our company
and insult your leadership.

525
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,650
It was a bad idea from the start.

526
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:33,369
What exactly did he say?

527
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,379
He said Ford makes ugly little cars,

528
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,630
and we make 'em...

529
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:46,924
in an ugly factory.

530
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:52,179
He said our executives are sons of whores.

531
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,226
About me?

532
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,729
He called you fat, sir.

533
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:03,315
And, uh...

534
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:04,900
pigheaded.

535
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:07,444
Go on.

536
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,573
He said you're not Henry Ford.

537
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:13,242
You're Henry Ford ll.

538
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:39,101
I want the best engineers.

539
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,563
The best drivers.

540
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,734
I don't care what it costs.

541
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:51,864
We're gonna build a race car.

542
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:01,290
And we're gonna bury
that goddamn greasy wop

543
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:05,002
100 feet deep
under the finish line at Le Mans.

544
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,048
And I will be there to watch it.

545
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,051
Here they come. Go, go, go, go.

546
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:17,014
Assholes.

547
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:18,265
You're really pathetic.

548
00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:19,266
I'm so sorry, girls.

549
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,684
Charlie!

550
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:22,770
Quit throwing crackers
at the girls all damn day.

551
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,104
God damn it.

552
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,272
Do I gotta deal with this?

553
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:26,732
It's already taken care of.

554
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:32,279
Sorry about that.
So, yeah, 289 cubic inch V8.

555
00:34:32,363 --> 00:34:33,572
Far out.

556
00:34:33,656 --> 00:34:35,491
Extensive rework of AC Ace's front end.

557
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,576
And a stronger rear diff
to handle the torque.

558
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,078
How's she handle a quarter mile?

559
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,914
Well, now, I'm not saying
you should go drag racing,

560
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,582
but a quarter mile's 13.6.

561
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:44,959
Yeah.

562
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:46,502
- Is that good?
- Oh, that's real good.

563
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,546
He sold that same car
three times this week.

564
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,882
- You take cash? Is cash okay?
- Cash is okay.

565
00:34:51,966 --> 00:34:54,176
Yeah, mister, you just bought yourself
one hell of a sport car.

566
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,427
All right.

567
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,265
Tell you what, I'm gonna... Phil!

568
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:00,724
I'm gonna pass you off
to my colleague here.

569
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:01,976
He gonna take care of you.

570
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:03,978
- Phil, Wyatt.
- Hello, Wyatt.

571
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:05,104
I'm gonna steal him for one second.

572
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:07,815
You take the payment.

573
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:09,650
Whatever you do,
do not let him take that car.

574
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:10,985
That's Jeff Blitzer's car.

575
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,070
And Frank Collins' and Steve McQueen's.

576
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,114
Shit. I forgot about McQueen.

577
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:19,326
Morning.

578
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,036
Can I help you?

579
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:23,539
Carroll Shelby?

580
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:25,749
Maybe.

581
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:29,628
Lee lacocca, Ford Motor.

582
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,383
What's with the wrench?

583
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,844
That? Oh, long story.

584
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,681
We are just going from strength
to strength here, Lee.

585
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:44,018
Terrific sales,
we're killing it on the track.

586
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:46,770
Now, I know I owe Ford
for that last batch of engines--

587
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:49,523
Mr. Shelby, I can assure you
I'm not here for money

588
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,525
that you might owe Ford for spare parts.

589
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:54,194
You're not?

590
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:56,322
No, I'm not.

591
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:58,657
Okay.

592
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:01,493
I'm here on behalf
of Mr. Ford, Henry Ford ll.

593
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:04,204
Suppose, um, hypothetically,

594
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:08,250
that he wanted his company
to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

595
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,588
You're one of the only Americans
that's ever done it...

596
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:13,881
so I'm wondering...

597
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:15,924
what's it take?

598
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,596
Hypothetically?

599
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,057
Hypothetically.

600
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,185
It takes something money can't buy.

601
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:28,854
Money can buy speed.

602
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:32,107
But it isn't about speed, Lee.

603
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,194
It's not just like those other tracks

604
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:38,155
where all you do is turn
to the left for four hours.

605
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,368
To win that race, you need a car

606
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:44,661
that's light enough to do 200
on the straightaways

607
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:47,831
but strong enough to keep that up
for 3,000 miles without a break.

608
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,877
Not just the best car

609
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,754
y'all have ever made,
but better than anything

610
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,756
that Enzo Ferrari shows up with that year.

611
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,508
And that just gets you to the green flag.

612
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:59,259
That's where your problems really start.

613
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:03,097
Is everything okay?

614
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,099
Go away.

615
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,274
So you're saying it's challenging.

616
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:18,946
Look, it's not even a track, Lee.

617
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:21,949
Le Mans is eight and a half
miles of country road.

618
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:26,787
It's narrow, ungraded, it's rough.

619
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,665
There's no camber on the turns, no rails.

620
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,128
You gotta do that for 24 hours.

621
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:37,339
Twenty-four hours, Lee.

622
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:40,717
That means night.

623
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:44,179
Half that race is in the dark.
You can't see shit.

624
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,975
Cars coming up on you out of nowhere.

625
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,396
Drivers stumbling around
the track, pouring blood.

626
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:55,149
Maybe one of 'em's your friend. Maybe...

627
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,443
Maybe he's on fire.

628
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:01,280
You're exhausted, you're hungry...

629
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,408
can't remember your name,
what country you're in.

630
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:08,745
And all of a sudden, you realize
you're doing 198 on a straight.

631
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:14,126
And if anything goes wrong...

632
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,880
you blow a gasket, a five-cent washer...

633
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:20,090
that's it, whole thing's over.

634
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:22,509
Ferrari wins again.

635
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:25,762
Just like he won last year
and the year before that.

636
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,473
And the year before that.

637
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:32,436
Yeah.

638
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,229
It's challenging.

639
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,024
So you don't think...

640
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,401
that Ford Motor Company can build

641
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:41,570
the greatest race car
the world's ever seen?

642
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,031
You think that we are incapable

643
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,824
of winning an event like that?

644
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,327
Even if we had a brilliant partner?

645
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:54,750
Even if we wrote a, uh, blank check?

646
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:04,343
What I'm saying is,
you can't buy a win, Lee.

647
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:11,141
But maybe you could buy
the guy who gets you a shot.

648
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,270
♪ <i>Have love</i> ♪

649
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:18,899
♪ <i>Whoa, baby, will travel</i> ♪

650
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:22,361
♪ <i>Have love</i> ♪

651
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,989
♪ <i>Whoa, baby, will travel...</i> ♪

652
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:32,829
A new transmission, axles,
shocks all around,

653
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:35,999
ditch the body and the tires,
you have yourself a contender.

654
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:39,419
Anything on this beauty that does work?

655
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:42,130
The mirrors are outstanding.

656
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,465
I saw that walking up.

657
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:48,595
So, what, you just passing
on an evening stroll?

658
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:52,099
Actually, Bulldog,
I have a proposition for you.

659
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:56,144
You're gonna build a car
to beat Old Man Ferrari...

660
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:57,980
- Yeah.
- ...with Ford?

661
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,274
With a Ford?

662
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:01,650
Correct.

663
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,652
And how long did you tell them
that you needed?

664
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,279
Two, three hundred years?

665
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:06,780
Ninety days.

666
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,704
All right, so let's just look
at this for a moment.

667
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,331
And for argument's sake,

668
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:18,792
let's just forget about
the whole 90-day thing, all right?

669
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,460
So let's just pretend you've got
all the money in the world

670
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:22,629
and all the time in the world.

671
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:24,381
- I like the sound of that.
- All right.

672
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:25,507
So...

673
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:28,885
you think that Ford
are gonna let you build

674
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,431
the car that you want...

675
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,850
the way you want it?

676
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,644
The Ford Motor Company?

677
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,063
Those guys?

678
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:42,566
Have you ever been to Detroit?

679
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,652
I mean, they have
floors and floors of lawyers

680
00:40:45,736 --> 00:40:48,822
and millions of marketing guys,
and they're all gonna want to meet you.

681
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:50,324
All of them are gonna want
to get their photo taken

682
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:52,492
with the great Carroll Shelby,
and they're gonna kiss your ass

683
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:54,369
then they're gonna go
back to their lovely offices...

684
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,955
and they're gonna work out
new ways to screw you.

685
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:59,708
Why? Because they can't help it.

686
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,501
Because they just want
to please their boss

687
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:04,463
who wants to please his boss
who wants to please his boss.

688
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:07,591
And they hate themselves for it.

689
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,343
But deep down...

690
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:12,679
who they hate even more
are guys like you,

691
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:14,139
because you're not like them,

692
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,807
because you don't think like them,

693
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:17,643
because you're different.

694
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,854
It's coming straight from the Deuce.

695
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:26,068
He's serious.
They're gonna put real money behind it.

696
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:30,906
I'll bet they are.

697
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:33,492
You know why?

698
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:36,119
Because someone, and I'm not saying who,

699
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:41,875
someone has told them that
this is actually possible.

700
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:43,418
Look...

701
00:41:43,502 --> 00:41:45,212
this Sunday at Cloverfield,

702
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,463
they're launching the new Mustang.

703
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,131
They're gonna announce the race program.

704
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:50,592
Just come on by.

705
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:55,472
Come take a look. Listen to my speech.

706
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,099
I'm making a speech.

707
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:59,518
Bring Peter. He'll love it.

708
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:03,063
All right, Shel.

709
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:06,858
See you Sunday.

710
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,446
Whoa.

711
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:15,033
Dad, look at that.

712
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:17,369
Huh.

713
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:21,373
The Ford Mustang. What do you think?

714
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:26,712
I think it's a secretary's car.

715
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,881
I like it.

716
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:32,759
Oh.

717
00:42:32,843 --> 00:42:34,428
Excu... Excuse me.

718
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:37,723
Would you, would you not do that?

719
00:42:38,432 --> 00:42:40,392
Oh. Sorry.

720
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:46,231
Oh, er, is this, is this your son?

721
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:48,525
Yes, it is.

722
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:51,027
Would you ask him to keep
his hands off the paintwork?

723
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:54,322
No, no, no, Peter.
You're okay. Who are you?

724
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:55,949
Leo Beebe,

725
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,701
senior executive vice president,
Ford Motor Company.

726
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:58,827
Ah.

727
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,079
I'm responsible for the launch
of the Mustang.

728
00:43:01,163 --> 00:43:03,915
Ah! At least now we know
who's responsible.

729
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:05,041
Don't get me wrong, Lenny.

730
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:08,044
- Leo.
- It looks fantastic.

731
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:11,381
But inside, it's a lump of lard
dressed up to fool the public.

732
00:43:11,465 --> 00:43:13,425
My advice is,

733
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:16,720
lose the inline-six
and that idiotic three-speed,

734
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:20,307
shorten the wheelbase,
somehow lose half a ton,

735
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,641
and lower the price.

736
00:43:21,725 --> 00:43:22,726
Dad.

737
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:25,437
But even then,
I'd still choose a Chevy Chevelle.

738
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:29,149
And that's a fucking terrible car.

739
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,152
<i>How are we doing up there, Steve?</i>

740
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:34,404
There's Cloverfield, Mr. Shelby.

741
00:43:35,197 --> 00:43:36,573
Oh, yeah.

742
00:43:37,491 --> 00:43:39,284
You mind if I take a shot at the landing?

743
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:40,368
Uh...

744
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:41,578
No, no, no. I mean it.

745
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:44,664
- I flew B-29s out of San Antone in '44.
- You're kidding.

746
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:46,917
- I did.
- Okay.

747
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,210
Carroll, what are you doing?

748
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:49,795
- Does he know how to fly?
- Carroll.

749
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:52,631
I had an instructor tell me, he said...

750
00:43:52,714 --> 00:43:54,966
Don, I would say it's probably
a good time to buckle up.

751
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:56,843
"...do everybody a favor,
stay on the ground."

752
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,429
That's a true story.

753
00:43:59,513 --> 00:44:00,764
- Oh, no.
- Oh, shit.

754
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,516
- God damn it.
- Here we go.

755
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:05,811
<i>This is the car
you never expected from Detroit.</i>

756
00:44:08,814 --> 00:44:11,316
All right. Let's go.

757
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:14,694
Not staying, Ken?

758
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:17,739
Ah, it's a bloody pig in a poke, isn't it?

759
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:19,115
Oh, here they come now.

760
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,456
- Wait. Are they crashing?
- Oh, Lord.

761
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,041
Who's the pilot?

762
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:29,751
My guess, Peter...

763
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:34,339
it's someone we know.

764
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:36,925
<i>Everything all right up there?</i>

765
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:39,177
Oh, no.

766
00:44:39,261 --> 00:44:40,470
- No!
- Hang on.

767
00:44:40,554 --> 00:44:43,139
Oh, shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

768
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:46,726
<i>Shit. Shit. Shit.</i>

769
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,562
Tell you what, that's like riding a bike.

770
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:56,820
Talk about making an entrance.

771
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:58,655
- Shelby...
- Good grief.

772
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,240
- Shelby!
- All right!

773
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:02,284
- Over here. Over here!
- Shelby!

774
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:03,910
How y'all doing?

775
00:45:03,994 --> 00:45:05,120
Can I get your autograph, please?

776
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:06,413
Can I get your autograph, sir?

777
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:07,873
Carroll, this is Roy Lunn.

778
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:10,542
Old Roy here is developing
the prototype over in England.

779
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,711
Oh, hell, I know Roy.
Good to see you, Roy.

780
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:14,129
Welcome to the madhouse, Shelby.

781
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:16,840
Ford wheeled out the entire
executive committee for this one.

782
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:18,174
Hold that thought.

783
00:45:18,842 --> 00:45:19,718
Ah.

784
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:21,219
Hello, Mr. Lindbergh.

785
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:23,722
You like that?
Hey, Peter, how you doing?

786
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:25,223
- Mr. Shelby.
- Good to see you.

787
00:45:25,307 --> 00:45:27,392
Are you building a car
that's gonna beat Ferrari?

788
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:31,229
Well, we're gonna go
to Le Mans, that's for sure.

789
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:33,398
And if we get across
that finish line first, we're gonna win.

790
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,400
Carroll, allow me
to introduce Leo Beebe,

791
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,569
senior vice president, Ford Motor.

792
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:39,070
Oh, sure. Yeah. A pleasure, Mr. Beebe.

793
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:40,655
- Thank you for coming.
- Say hello to Ken Miles

794
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:41,907
- and his son, Peter.
- Yeah.

795
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,409
- We've, um... we met.
- We, uh... we met.

796
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:46,411
Yeah.

797
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,204
Didn't we?

798
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:50,081
So, um, well...

799
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:52,667
I'll take Petey for some pop.

800
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,211
Good luck with these guys, Shel.

801
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:56,963
- Bye, Mr. Shelby.
- See you, Pete.

802
00:45:57,756 --> 00:45:59,215
Don't worry, he's gonna stay.

803
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:03,011
So, you two get a chance
to talk on the plane?

804
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:05,263
Yeah. Uh...

805
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,475
Carroll, why don't we just
step this way for a second?

806
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:17,484
Look, it's pro form a.
It's window dressing.

807
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:19,194
But there's gotta be
a sense of give-and-take

808
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:20,487
between you and...

809
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:21,947
you know.

810
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:23,031
No, I don't.

811
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:24,199
The group.

812
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:25,450
"The group"?

813
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:26,743
Senior creatives, Carroll.

814
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,870
Just to make sure everybody's comfortable.

815
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:30,789
Well, I'm confused, Lee.

816
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:33,667
'Cause up until this moment, right now,
I was comfortable.

817
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:36,836
You should take a look
out there, Carroll. Hmm?

818
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,213
What do you see?

819
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,006
You know what I see?

820
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:41,466
I see a machine.

821
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:43,593
I see 10,000 moving parts,

822
00:46:43,677 --> 00:46:44,928
moving hopefully in harmony,

823
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:46,596
and it's my job to make it so.

824
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,014
It's my job to guide you through it.

825
00:46:48,098 --> 00:46:50,058
I am here to help you, Carroll.

826
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:51,643
But you gotta trust me.

827
00:46:52,686 --> 00:46:53,937
- Excuse me, Lee.
- Carroll...

828
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:56,606
do not step on that stage
if you don't trust me.

829
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:59,359
<i>Please welcome Mr. Carroll Shelby.</i>

830
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:00,986
Gotta go.

831
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,991
Shelby... Oh. Shelby.

832
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:08,702
What'd he say?

833
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:09,911
He gets the drill.

834
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:14,666
<i>Thank you.</i>

835
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,876
<i>Well, if my daddy was here today...</i>

836
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,212
<i>he'd tell me to sit on down</i>

837
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,840
<i>and leave the yakking
to the college boys, so...</i>

838
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:24,467
<i>like my cars, I'll make this fast.</i>

839
00:47:27,137 --> 00:47:29,472
<i>When I was 10 years old,
Pops said to me, "Son...</i>

840
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,225
<i>"it's a truly lucky man</i>

841
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,019
<i>"who knows what he wants
to do in this world.</i>

842
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:36,688
<i>'Cause that man will
never work a day in his life."</i>

843
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:40,483
<i>But there are a few, a precious few,</i>

844
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:42,444
<i>and, hell, I don't know
if they're lucky or not.</i>

845
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:46,156
<i>But there are a few people
who find something they have to do.</i>

846
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:49,200
<i>Something obsesses 'em.</i>

847
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:51,911
<i>Something that if they can't do it,</i>

848
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,080
<i>it's gonna drive them
clean out of their mind.</i>

849
00:47:55,415 --> 00:47:56,583
<i>I'm that guy.</i>

850
00:47:57,834 --> 00:48:00,295
<i>And I know one other man
feels exactly the same.</i>

851
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:03,006
<i>His name...</i>

852
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:07,469
<i>His name is Mr. Henry Ford.</i>

853
00:48:07,552 --> 00:48:09,804
Yeah! Whoo!

854
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:15,769
<i>And together, we're gonna build
the fastest automobiles in the world.</i>

855
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,775
<i>And we're gonna make history,
too, at Le Mans.</i>

856
00:48:24,861 --> 00:48:26,780
- Let's go.
- What?

857
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:29,115
<i>My name is Carroll Shelby.</i>

858
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:31,493
<i>I build race cars.</i>

859
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:56,643
No. Whatever it is, no.

860
00:48:58,978 --> 00:48:59,938
No.

861
00:49:01,064 --> 00:49:02,065
Thirty minutes.

862
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:05,318
Ah, just... I'm spent.

863
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,737
- I wanna have a bath.
- You're gonna wanna see this.

864
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:09,739
Trust me.

865
00:49:11,032 --> 00:49:13,535
Thirty minutes. I'll have you
back for meatloaf and gravy.

866
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,081
Thirty minutes.

867
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:19,415
Yeah.

868
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:39,352
Bloody hell.

869
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,068
Fresh off the plane from England.

870
00:49:48,278 --> 00:49:52,907
Now, she's still a little
on the rare side of cooked.

871
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:03,918
Whoa! Come on.

872
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:18,057
Interesting.

873
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:36,034
Well?

874
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:37,452
It's awful.

875
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:38,828
It's worse than awful.

876
00:50:38,912 --> 00:50:42,582
Yeah, it doesn't track.
You know, the third gear is too high.

877
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:46,294
Torque is not reaching the road.

878
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:50,298
Steering's loose because
the front end gets light.

879
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,675
And over 140, it thinks it's a...

880
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:53,718
Airplane.

881
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,094
Yeah.

882
00:50:55,178 --> 00:50:57,180
It wants to lift off and fly to Hawaii.

883
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,184
Anything else?

884
00:51:06,648 --> 00:51:08,483
One sec.

885
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:40,306
You were back late last night.

886
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:41,432
Yeah.

887
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:47,522
- Were you working?
- Mmm.

888
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:52,402
So, you didn't go anyplace?

889
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:54,779
What?

890
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:58,825
Well, I'm asking, did you
go anyplace last night?

891
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:02,704
Mollie.

892
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:04,580
It's a simple question.

893
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,543
And I answered, didn't I?

894
00:52:09,085 --> 00:52:10,295
What was the answer?

895
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:13,381
Is something up, love?

896
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:17,302
What are you doing? What are you doing?

897
00:52:17,385 --> 00:52:19,095
You're driving very fast.

898
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:20,346
Oh, am I? Am I?

899
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:21,514
Yes, you are.

900
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,685
Bloody hell! What are you...
The hell is this?

901
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:28,104
Well, you tell me, 'cause I don't know.

902
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:32,108
Right, slow down!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Mollie!

903
00:52:34,736 --> 00:52:37,071
Please slow it down, all right?

904
00:52:37,155 --> 00:52:38,906
You trying to kill us or something?

905
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,825
- Well, I thought we love this shit.
- What?

906
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:45,413
- Bloody hell!
- It's a bit of racing fun. No?

907
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:46,873
No, no, no. It's not the same at all.

908
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:48,833
Well, I think it's thrilling!

909
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,877
All right.

910
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,545
Look, I saw you, all right?

911
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,424
I saw you leaving with Shelby,
and I saw you coming back.

912
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,384
Okay. Shit. Okay, but slow it...

913
00:52:58,468 --> 00:53:00,928
And then all day you've got
that stupid look on your face.

914
00:53:01,012 --> 00:53:03,014
Mollie, slow down. You're too close here.

915
00:53:05,975 --> 00:53:08,519
Mollie, put on the brakes right now...

916
00:53:08,603 --> 00:53:10,772
Not until you tell me what's going on!

917
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:13,191
All right. I went to look at a car.

918
00:53:13,274 --> 00:53:15,151
- With Shelby?
- With Shelby.

919
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,195
- A racing car?
- Sort of.

920
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:20,239
There's a corner coming.
You'd better hold on.

921
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:24,535
Oh! Are you gonna lift your
foot off at all through this?

922
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:26,120
No, 'cause I like a clean racing line.

923
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:27,205
Slow down!

924
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,168
Okay.

925
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:33,920
Shel offered me a job.

926
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:37,465
Ford has a car that they want
to put up against a Ferrari.

927
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,175
- You told me you were done.
- That's it. Now, slow...

928
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:40,718
I didn't say yes.

929
00:53:40,802 --> 00:53:42,220
Slow down.

930
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:43,721
You told me you quit.

931
00:53:44,931 --> 00:53:47,433
- I don't understand.
- Get fat and old, you said.

932
00:53:47,517 --> 00:53:49,060
Fat and old.

933
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:54,565
- I don't understand.
- That's what you told me.

934
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:56,317
I don't understand.

935
00:53:56,401 --> 00:54:00,530
Are you upset because I said I was done
or because I looked at a race car?

936
00:54:02,115 --> 00:54:04,534
Just don't lie to me, Ken.

937
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:07,912
Don't make it a secret,

938
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:09,414
what you want or what you feel,

939
00:54:09,497 --> 00:54:12,125
just because you think
it's gonna make me happy.

940
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:16,295
Moll, I don't even know what I feel.

941
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:24,971
If you do this...

942
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:29,892
then he better be paying you this time.

943
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:35,189
'Cause I can't work any more
hours and look after Peter.

944
00:54:35,273 --> 00:54:36,732
You know, the IRS have the garage.

945
00:54:36,816 --> 00:54:38,860
I'm not losing my home.

946
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:41,279
It's $200 a day.

947
00:54:44,157 --> 00:54:45,658
Plus expenses.

948
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:49,745
Are you shitting me?

949
00:54:50,246 --> 00:54:52,373
But I haven't decided.

950
00:54:55,293 --> 00:54:56,752
$200 a day?

951
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:00,631
Are you nuts?

952
00:55:24,322 --> 00:55:27,241
Look at this. This is ridiculous. Here.

953
00:55:27,325 --> 00:55:30,411
So, Shel, grabbing air.

954
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:31,871
That's the problem.

955
00:55:32,788 --> 00:55:36,417
Over 90, air's getting in,
not getting out.

956
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:38,419
It's the nose, I can feel it in the wheel.

957
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:40,796
Mr. Miles, if there's a problem,
the computer will find it.

958
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,089
- All right.
- Charlie,

959
00:55:42,173 --> 00:55:44,342
get some Scotch tape and a ball of wool.

960
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:47,803
All right. Good, good, good.

961
00:55:47,887 --> 00:55:51,682
So, now let's just, uh,
get all of this junk out.

962
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:52,850
Right, Pops?

963
00:55:52,934 --> 00:55:55,436
Yeah, yeah. I concur.
Come on, guys.

964
00:55:58,064 --> 00:55:59,065
What are they doing?

965
00:55:59,774 --> 00:56:01,317
Making your car faster.

966
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:11,285
There. Right there.
Airflow's getting stuck.

967
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:17,416
I see it.
Yarn blows straight up.

968
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,876
- Yep.
- The front's lifting.

969
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,461
Damn, he's right.

970
00:56:31,347 --> 00:56:34,559
This car wants to go faster. I feel it.

971
00:56:34,642 --> 00:56:36,727
Any lighter, we're getting fragile.

972
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:39,021
Took 70 pounds out of her
in the last week.

973
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:41,899
She's outputting max horsepower
from this displacement.

974
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,235
So put in a bigger engine.

975
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:45,778
Where we gonna put it? On the roof?

976
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:50,616
Managed to make it
52 pounds lighter

977
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,368
than the NASCAR unit.

978
00:56:57,206 --> 00:56:59,500
All-new aluminum cylinder heads...

979
00:57:00,376 --> 00:57:03,337
vibration dampeners,
water pump, smaller valves.

980
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:05,131
We call it the Beast.

981
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:07,133
Yeah, I can see why,

982
00:57:07,216 --> 00:57:08,384
but how's it gonna fit

983
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,469
without a redesign of the engine bed?

984
00:57:10,553 --> 00:57:11,721
Well, it certainly wasn't easy.

985
00:57:11,804 --> 00:57:13,055
Good morning, gentlemen. Mr. Shelby.

986
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:17,018
So, you already put that in a GT40?

987
00:57:17,435 --> 00:57:19,395
I'm afraid we have.

988
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,569
I'll be damned.

989
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,696
Well, it's heavy, of course.

990
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,281
Problems with the handling,
especially the stopping.

991
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:32,325
- I can show you the data.
- What problems?

992
00:57:32,408 --> 00:57:33,618
- Understeers a little, but...
- Can I, uh, borrow that?

993
00:57:33,701 --> 00:57:35,244
Can I borrow that?

994
00:57:35,328 --> 00:57:36,579
Just a second. Thank you.

995
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:37,538
Ken!

996
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:41,626
Ken, perhaps you want to check
with HQ before you test...

997
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:43,210
What did he say?

998
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:44,295
We should ask...

999
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:45,379
Right.

1000
00:57:47,882 --> 00:57:50,760
Oh, yes!

1001
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:00,645
Mr. Shelby, welcome to Dearborn.

1002
00:58:00,728 --> 00:58:02,104
What are you doing at a test track?

1003
00:58:02,188 --> 00:58:04,398
You're gonna get Castrol oil
all over that nice suit.

1004
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:07,109
Ah, I wanted to hear your thoughts
on a few planning decisions.

1005
00:58:07,193 --> 00:58:08,694
You know, personnel for Le Mans.

1006
00:58:08,778 --> 00:58:10,112
Well, it's a hell of a lineup.

1007
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:12,114
Ken Miles, Phil Hill,

1008
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:13,991
Chris Amon, Bruce McLaren.

1009
00:58:14,075 --> 00:58:16,452
Hill's a lock. Amon, McLaren, too.

1010
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:18,245
We're less sure about Miles.

1011
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:19,705
We like Richie Ginther...

1012
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:22,667
Masten Gregory, Bob Bondurant.

1013
00:58:23,376 --> 00:58:25,419
Well, you're gonna want
the best driver for the car.

1014
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:27,046
Understands the machine.

1015
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,547
That's Ken.

1016
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:30,466
Oh! Yes!

1017
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:34,804
More of that, please.
More of that, my girl.

1018
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:37,098
I may not get the finer points
of racing, Mr. Shelby,

1019
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:38,474
but I do know people.

1020
00:58:39,058 --> 00:58:40,101
Miles is a...

1021
00:58:40,685 --> 00:58:43,187
Well, he's a beatnik. He dresses like one.

1022
00:58:44,105 --> 00:58:45,356
Ford means reliability.

1023
00:58:46,065 --> 00:58:47,817
Ken Miles is not a Ford man.

1024
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,735
Whoa!

1025
00:58:49,819 --> 00:58:51,570
Giddy-up! Giddy-up!

1026
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:56,992
What's the lap record here, Burt?

1027
00:58:57,076 --> 00:58:58,327
58.

1028
00:58:59,328 --> 00:59:01,664
- 50 dead.
<i>- A beatnik?</i>

1029
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:04,458
That man landed a busted tank
on the beach at D-Day

1030
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:06,502
and drove it clean
across Europe to Berlin.

1031
00:59:07,378 --> 00:59:08,921
A beatnik?

1032
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:10,464
You know, Lee here asked me a while back,

1033
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:12,258
"What's the one thing money can't buy?"

1034
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:14,301
I'll tell you what it is.

1035
00:59:14,927 --> 00:59:16,887
A pure racer behind the wheel of your car.

1036
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,265
That's Ken Miles.

1037
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:22,518
Well, be that as it may...

1038
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:25,312
we think he may be too pure.

1039
00:59:33,446 --> 00:59:36,615
Carroll, do not lose sight
of the big picture here.

1040
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:39,243
"Too pure"?

1041
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,704
What exactly does that mean?

1042
00:59:42,538 --> 00:59:43,873
It means he's all about himself.

1043
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,918
ABC puts a microphone under his nose,

1044
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:50,212
perhaps there's a detail he dislikes,

1045
00:59:50,296 --> 00:59:51,630
millions watching...

1046
00:59:51,714 --> 00:59:53,799
do you trust him not to
put out the wrong message?

1047
00:59:53,883 --> 00:59:56,552
Well, look, you can get a clean-cut,
all-American poster boy

1048
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:57,720
and stick him behind the wheel,

1049
00:59:57,803 --> 00:59:59,138
teach him what to say.

1050
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:01,932
Shit, you get Doris Day to drive the car,
if all you want to do is lose.

1051
01:00:02,767 --> 01:00:05,519
So, you don't agree with us on this issue?

1052
01:00:07,897 --> 01:00:09,982
I'm saying you gotta trust me on this one.

1053
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:13,444
Carroll, with marketing concerns,
that's just not possible.

1054
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:18,657
Put a Ford-type driver
in a Ford car, Mr. Shelby.

1055
01:00:19,575 --> 01:00:20,951
That's the Ford way.

1056
01:00:27,333 --> 01:00:29,960
<i>Yet another championship win for Ferrari</i>

1057
01:00:30,044 --> 01:00:31,712
<i>as British driver John Surtees</i>

1058
01:00:31,796 --> 01:00:33,422
<i>pilots his Ferrari 312...</i>

1059
01:00:33,506 --> 01:00:34,715
Ferrari wins.

1060
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:37,885
<i>It's Surtees'
first win since the '64...</i>

1061
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,762
Wedges. We have wedges.

1062
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:41,847
Oh, good, good, good.

1063
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:43,057
Perfect.

1064
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:45,810
- 40?
- Yep.

1065
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:56,654
- Hey, boss.
- Hey, Dan.

1066
01:00:56,737 --> 01:00:58,948
- Boss, Ferrari just bagged--
- You got a passport?

1067
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:00,032
What's that?

1068
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:01,867
Sign that. Get a passport.

1069
01:01:01,951 --> 01:01:03,702
Get it back to me by Friday. Frosty.

1070
01:01:03,786 --> 01:01:04,829
Boys, I'm going to France.

1071
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:08,499
Phil.

1072
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,042
Ken, can I get a word?

1073
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:17,633
Oh.

1074
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:20,427
Can I take this?

1075
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,595
Hey.

1076
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:25,224
Do you know why Ford named it the GT40?

1077
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:27,226
Why they put that "40" on there?

1078
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,270
- No.
- Regulations. All right?

1079
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:31,856
We gotta be 40 inches high

1080
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:34,650
to make the ground clearance requirements.

1081
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:35,734
No more, no less.

1082
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:37,486
They measure it before every race.

1083
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:40,531
Problem is, that with that height,

1084
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:43,492
there's too much drag
under the car, all right?

1085
01:01:43,576 --> 01:01:45,369
So, we have a solution.

1086
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,121
Wedges. We put wedges in the suspension...

1087
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:48,747
You're not coming next week.

1088
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:52,877
You're not coming, Ken.

1089
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,008
We're taking McLaren,
Chris Amon, Phil Hill...

1090
01:02:00,301 --> 01:02:01,594
and Bob Bondurant.

1091
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:03,888
It's Ford's call.

1092
01:02:05,431 --> 01:02:07,850
It is their opinion that
you are not a good image,

1093
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:10,019
so you cannot drive their race car.

1094
01:02:11,687 --> 01:02:13,314
And putting aside the fact
that you made that car

1095
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:14,565
whatever the hell it is...

1096
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:18,193
and you're the best man
I got behind the wheel...

1097
01:02:38,172 --> 01:02:40,090
I'm gonna reroute the oil line.

1098
01:02:40,174 --> 01:02:43,761
If there's spillage, it could drip
onto the rear nearside disc.

1099
01:02:43,844 --> 01:02:45,012
Ken...

1100
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:50,434
Tell the boys
to watch their pace come sunrise.

1101
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:53,854
The, uh, the gearbox will overheat.

1102
01:03:11,956 --> 01:03:13,207
Ken, the race is starting soon.

1103
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,708
Want it on the radio?

1104
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:16,168
Not unless you do.

1105
01:03:35,354 --> 01:03:36,689
<i>...of the race.</i>

1106
01:03:36,772 --> 01:03:37,856
<i>There they are.</i>

1107
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:39,066
<i>The Maserati going into the Esses,</i>

1108
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:41,443
<i>but it's still the number 2 car,
driven by Chris Amon.</i>

1109
01:03:41,527 --> 01:03:43,404
<i>In third place, is the number 1 Ford</i>

1110
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:45,072
<i>that is driven by Bruce McŁaren.</i>

1111
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,157
<i>A tremendously fast start for the Ford GT.</i>

1112
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:51,662
<i><i>43.4 lap for car number 2, a Ford.</i>

1113
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:53,288
<i>I think
it's a little bit quick</i>

1114
01:03:53,372 --> 01:03:54,581
<i>for this stage of the game.</i>

1115
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:55,666
<i>Little bit quick right now.</i>

1116
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:56,917
Racing too hot.

1117
01:03:58,544 --> 01:04:01,213
<i>This could go down
to the last hour or so, don't you think?</i>

1118
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:02,339
<i>It could,
but the probabilities</i>

1119
01:04:02,423 --> 01:04:05,300
<i>for a finish like that
in a 24-hour race are awfully small.</i>

1120
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:07,553
<i>Another Ford
has come into the pits.</i>

1121
01:04:07,636 --> 01:04:09,930
<i>It's being pushed into
the pits by the mechanics.</i>

1122
01:04:10,014 --> 01:04:11,306
Head gasket.

1123
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,892
The car's not a moon rocket.

1124
01:04:14,268 --> 01:04:15,602
<i>Trailing
Bob Bondurant in fourth,</i>

1125
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:17,021
<i>car number 7.</i>

1126
01:04:17,104 --> 01:04:20,190
<i>Leading number 20, Ferrari.
Michael Parkes.</i>

1127
01:04:20,274 --> 01:04:22,359
<i>So, we have Ford running one,
two, three. How about that?</i>

1128
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:24,278
Too soon. Surely too soon.

1129
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:28,824
<i>One has
to really be respectful</i>

1130
01:04:28,907 --> 01:04:30,325
<i>of the mechanism with any...</i>

1131
01:04:42,463 --> 01:04:43,881
<i>Here's the big story,</i>

1132
01:04:43,964 --> 01:04:46,425
<i>the lead Ford, driven
by Richie Ginther, retired</i>

1133
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:48,594
<i>with gearbox trouble,
and the new leader...</i>

1134
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:52,431
Gearbox. I told them. Be gentle with it.

1135
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:54,058
<i>...and his
partner Lorenzo Bandini...</i>

1136
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:55,267
<i>...who was one of</i>

1137
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,061
<i>the two winning drivers last year.</i>

1138
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,064
Who's there?

1139
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:05,569
<i>Again, we're back,
speaking to you live from Le Mans, France.</i>

1140
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:08,197
<i>The 24 Hours of Le Mans,
the Grand Prix of Endurance,</i>

1141
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,740
<i>the 33rd renewal.</i>

1142
01:05:10,866 --> 01:05:12,409
What's that you're listening to?

1143
01:05:13,202 --> 01:05:15,537
Oh, some race over in France.

1144
01:05:18,624 --> 01:05:19,666
Exciting?

1145
01:05:20,459 --> 01:05:22,628
I'm not really paying much attention.

1146
01:05:22,711 --> 01:05:25,214
<i>However, Phil,
there was one time in 1933,</i>

1147
01:05:25,297 --> 01:05:28,258

Grace.

1164
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:14,615
Yes, sir. I will send him right in.

1165
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:16,825
Thank you.

1166
01:07:19,328 --> 01:07:21,622
Mr. Shelby, Mr. Ford will see you now.

1167
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:24,124
- All right.
- Are you still willing

1168
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:26,168
to stake your reputation on this guy?

1169
01:07:28,253 --> 01:07:29,630
This way, Mr. Shelby.

1170
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:40,974
Mr. Ford.

1171
01:07:41,642 --> 01:07:42,893
Gentlemen.

1172
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:44,269
Shelby.

1173
01:07:57,032 --> 01:07:59,952
Give me one reason
why I don't fire everyone

1174
01:08:00,035 --> 01:08:03,163
associated with this abomination
starting with you.

1175
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:11,004
Well, sir...

1176
01:08:12,339 --> 01:08:13,966
I was thinking about that very question

1177
01:08:14,049 --> 01:08:16,927
as I sat out there
in your lovely waiting room.

1178
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:20,138
As I was sitting there...

1179
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:23,308
I watched that little
red folder right there...

1180
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:25,978
go through four pairs of hands...

1181
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:28,647
before it got to you.

1182
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:30,649
'Course that doesn't include...

1183
01:08:31,817 --> 01:08:33,986
the 22 or so other Ford employees

1184
01:08:34,069 --> 01:08:35,487
who probably poked at it before it made

1185
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:37,155
its way up to the 19th floor.

1186
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:40,450
All due respect, sir,

1187
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:43,412
you can't win a race by committee.

1188
01:08:44,997 --> 01:08:46,665
You need one man in charge.

1189
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:49,751
Now, the good news, as I see it,

1190
01:08:50,252 --> 01:08:51,920
is that even with all the extra weight...

1191
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:57,676
we still managed to put old Mr. Ferrari
exactly where we want him.

1192
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:00,178
Did we?

1193
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:01,847
Oh, yes.

1194
01:09:03,724 --> 01:09:04,975
Expand.

1195
01:09:06,393 --> 01:09:07,436
Well...

1196
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:10,397
sure, we hadn't...

1197
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:13,442
We haven't worked out how to corner yet.

1198
01:09:14,526 --> 01:09:15,485
Or stay cool.

1199
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,655
Or stay on the ground.

1200
01:09:19,448 --> 01:09:20,782
And a lot of stuff broke.

1201
01:09:21,742 --> 01:09:24,328
In fact, the only thing that
didn't break was the brakes.

1202
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:26,913
Hell, right now, we don't even know

1203
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:29,541
if our paint job will last
the whole 24 hours.

1204
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:36,923
But our last lap...

1205
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:41,261
we clocked 218 miles an hour
down the Mulsanne Straight.

1206
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:45,182
Now, in all his years of racing...

1207
01:09:46,141 --> 01:09:49,478
old Enzo ain't never seen
anything move that fast.

1208
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:51,938
And now he knows...

1209
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:53,899
without a doubt...

1210
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:57,444
we're faster than he is...

1211
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,699
even with the wrong driver...

1212
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:05,285
and all the committees.

1213
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:11,083
And that's what he's thinking about
while he's sitting in Modena, Italy...

1214
01:10:12,084 --> 01:10:13,502
right now.

1215
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:16,671
That man is scared to death...

1216
01:10:18,131 --> 01:10:20,801
that this year you actually
might be smart enough

1217
01:10:20,884 --> 01:10:22,177
to start trusting me.

1218
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:26,640
So, yeah...

1219
01:10:28,642 --> 01:10:31,228
I'd say you got Ferrari
exactly where you want him.

1220
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:36,274
You're welcome.

1221
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:55,460
Come here.

1222
01:11:03,218 --> 01:11:04,928
See that little building down there?

1223
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:06,930
In World War ll...

1224
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:11,476
three out of five US bombers
rolled off that line.

1225
01:11:13,979 --> 01:11:15,814
You think Roosevelt beat Hitler?

1226
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:18,608
Think again.

1227
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:21,945
This isn't the first time
Ford Motor's gone to war in Europe.

1228
01:11:24,531 --> 01:11:26,908
We know how to do more than push paper.

1229
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:31,830
And there is one man running this company.

1230
01:11:34,416 --> 01:11:35,667
You report to him.

1231
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,462
You understand me?

1232
01:11:39,129 --> 01:11:40,338
Yes, sir.

1233
01:11:41,506 --> 01:11:43,884
Go ahead, Carroll. Go to war.

1234
01:11:47,012 --> 01:11:48,054
Thank you, sir.

1235
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:22,005
You were right.

1236
01:12:22,756 --> 01:12:23,924
It's the gearbox.

1237
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:25,926
We ran too hot.

1238
01:12:27,302 --> 01:12:28,470
Three out of four of 'em broke.

1239
01:12:29,513 --> 01:12:30,847
The rod blew on the other one.

1240
01:12:36,061 --> 01:12:37,604
We're going back, Ken.

1241
01:12:41,525 --> 01:12:44,694
They told me I had
"carte blanche" this time.

1242
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:48,740
I looked it up.
It's French for "horseshit."

1243
01:12:49,366 --> 01:12:51,576
I know they're gonna squeeze
our nuts any way they can

1244
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:52,869
soon as they work out how.

1245
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:54,829
Well, the, uh...

1246
01:12:55,956 --> 01:12:57,123
ice cream's melting.

1247
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:01,628
All right. Hey, Ken.

1248
01:13:03,338 --> 01:13:04,798
You want me to apologize?

1249
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:07,509
Mmm.

1250
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:09,052
You want me to beg?

1251
01:13:09,678 --> 01:13:11,388
I don't know. Let's try it out.

1252
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:13,640
Let's, uh, see how that feels.

1253
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:21,106
Ken, I'm sorry.

1254
01:13:22,524 --> 01:13:23,775
Sincerely.

1255
01:13:25,485 --> 01:13:26,611
Mmm.

1256
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:30,365
Do you have any idea the kind
of shit that I had to eat

1257
01:13:30,448 --> 01:13:31,950
just to get four wheels on that grid?

1258
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:33,326
No, you don't.

1259
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:35,036
'Cause you don't deal
with any of that stuff.

1260
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,415
Now knock it off, Ken. We got work to do,
and this car ain't gonna build itself.

1261
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:50,427
Okay. All right.

1262
01:13:59,394 --> 01:14:01,771
God.

1263
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:03,481
Come here.

1264
01:14:04,733 --> 01:14:06,776
- Bloody car salesman.
- Shit!

1265
01:14:09,988 --> 01:14:11,406
Come on. Now you're gonna get it.

1266
01:14:16,244 --> 01:14:17,412
Get off me!

1267
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:23,376
Stubborn son of a bitch.

1268
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:24,669
God!

1269
01:14:27,172 --> 01:14:28,423
- You just look...
- Right.

1270
01:14:29,507 --> 01:14:30,925
- Yeah, now.
- You...

1271
01:14:31,009 --> 01:14:32,510
- Ow!
- You all right?

1272
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:33,845
Shit!

1273
01:14:35,472 --> 01:14:36,890
Now you're gonna get it.

1274
01:14:38,683 --> 01:14:40,518
Come here.

1275
01:14:43,021 --> 01:14:44,105
Done.

1276
01:14:49,277 --> 01:14:50,362
Mollie, darling.

1277
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:52,197
Yes, love?

1278
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:54,115
Can I get a fizzy pop, please?

1279
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:56,576
Yes, love.

1280
01:14:58,411 --> 01:14:59,746
You want one, too, Shelby?

1281
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:02,165
- No. No.
- Uh, yes, please, Mollie.

1282
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:04,042
No. He can get his own.

1283
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:05,794
Just for me, please.

1284
01:15:12,759 --> 01:15:13,927
How long has that been?

1285
01:15:15,136 --> 01:15:17,013
Oh, it's gotta be three
or four years, at least.

1286
01:15:17,097 --> 01:15:19,349
Right. Riverside.

1287
01:15:19,432 --> 01:15:22,102
Yeah. SCCA Divisional Championship.

1288
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:23,895
You broke my finger.

1289
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:29,818
What's that nippy bloody thing

1290
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:31,736
you do under the arm, that thing?

1291
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:33,488
Yeah. I call that the Llama Bite.

1292
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:36,199
You name it?

1293
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:38,660
Where'd you learn that? The Girl Scouts?

1294
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:40,829
- What? You wanna go again?
- Here you go.

1295
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:43,331
You're an angel.

1296
01:15:43,415 --> 01:15:44,499
Thank you.

1297
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:45,709
My pleasure.

1298
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:49,212
Right. Well, I'm about to go
to the grocery store.

1299
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:50,839
Anything you think you'll need?

1300
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:53,508
Um, ice cream.

1301
01:15:54,634 --> 01:15:56,344
Ice cream would be good and, uh...

1302
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,263
bread.

1303
01:15:59,556 --> 01:16:00,724
Right.

1304
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:02,308
No, I'm good. Thank you.

1305
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:05,353
Thanks, Moll.

1306
01:16:05,437 --> 01:16:06,938
You still take those for your ticker?

1307
01:16:07,522 --> 01:16:09,524
Only 'cause they're so delicious.

1308
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:12,485
- Up yours.
- Oh, go to hell.

1309
01:16:20,577 --> 01:16:22,579
Come on. Giddy-up.
Giddy-up. Giddy-up. Giddy-up!

1310
01:16:38,553 --> 01:16:41,097
Phil! Here's the one for you, mate.

1311
01:16:41,181 --> 01:16:42,474
Dino, come here.

1312
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:03,703
- Well?
- There's still lag when I hit the gas.

1313
01:17:03,787 --> 01:17:05,288
Let's get rid of the vacuum secondaries.

1314
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:06,748
Charlie, get a Holley carb.

1315
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:08,625
We're gonna rebuild the throttle assembly.

1316
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:10,168
Three weeks to Daytona,

1317
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:13,129
and it still feels
like a bag of squirrels.

1318
01:17:13,213 --> 01:17:14,255
Brake heat.

1319
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:16,674
That's a whole different ball game.

1320
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:18,968
All right, Petey,
let's go for that ride.

1321
01:17:27,811 --> 01:17:28,937
What are you doing?

1322
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:32,106
You see that crack?

1323
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:33,733
That's my marker for turn eight.

1324
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:38,154
What, to slow down?

1325
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:42,200
Uh, brush the brakes and downshift.

1326
01:17:44,369 --> 01:17:46,621
But you'll be going 150 miles an hour.

1327
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:48,790
Yeah.

1328
01:17:48,873 --> 01:17:50,583
So how do you see it?

1329
01:17:50,667 --> 01:17:53,419
You're going fast,
but as the car speeds up...

1330
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:56,381
everything else slows down.

1331
01:17:56,464 --> 01:17:58,007
You don't do that.

1332
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:00,969
You do this. Right?

1333
01:18:01,052 --> 01:18:02,762
And then you see everything.

1334
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:07,392
Do you set other markers?

1335
01:18:07,475 --> 01:18:09,602
Indeed I do.

1336
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:12,438
Lots of them.

1337
01:18:14,566 --> 01:18:18,862
Yeah, 'cause you can't just push
the car hard the whole way, right?

1338
01:18:18,945 --> 01:18:21,656
That's right. You have
to be kind to the car.

1339
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:25,910
You feel the poor thing
groaning underneath you.

1340
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:30,790
If you're gonna push a piece
of machinery to the limit

1341
01:18:30,874 --> 01:18:32,625
and expect it to hold together,

1342
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:36,880
you have to have some sense
of where that limit is.

1343
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:40,800
Look out there.

1344
01:18:41,968 --> 01:18:44,888
Out there is the perfect lap.

1345
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:48,391
No mistakes.

1346
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,394
Every gear change, every corner...

1347
01:18:53,146 --> 01:18:54,188
perfect.

1348
01:18:55,857 --> 01:18:57,025
You see it?

1349
01:19:01,237 --> 01:19:02,405
I think so.

1350
01:19:04,449 --> 01:19:05,867
Most people can't.

1351
01:19:07,327 --> 01:19:09,996
Most people don't even know
it's out there, but it is.

1352
01:19:12,373 --> 01:19:13,541
It's there.

1353
01:19:16,628 --> 01:19:17,921
You want some ice cream?

1354
01:19:20,632 --> 01:19:21,883
- Yeah.
- All right.

1355
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:24,010
Come on, then.

1356
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,220
Do you know what this marker is?

1357
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:27,388
- What?
- That one.

1358
01:19:27,472 --> 01:19:28,848
Pull my finger. You'll find out.

1359
01:19:51,037 --> 01:19:53,122
How much longer before he comes in?

1360
01:19:53,206 --> 01:19:55,667
Uh, well, we change drivers
every four hours,

1361
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,460
- so about 10 minutes.
- No, <i>hang on.</i>

1362
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:00,088
You're saying Beebe
is 100 percent in charge now?

1363
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:02,048
<i>Yes, and he wants Miles gone.</i>

1364
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:04,759
Look, it is personal with this guy.

1365
01:20:04,842 --> 01:20:06,844
And, yes, he has the leverage
to stick it to you.

1366
01:20:06,928 --> 01:20:08,596
<i>He and the Deuce
are flying there tomorrow.</i>

1367
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:09,764
He's gonna tell you in person.

1368
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:11,099
Now, all he is hoping for

1369
01:20:11,182 --> 01:20:12,725
- is that you lose your cool.
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

1370
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:14,435
<i>It's time to let this go.</i>

1371
01:20:14,519 --> 01:20:15,812
You cannot destroy the whole thing.

1372
01:20:15,895 --> 01:20:16,980
Not for one goddamn guy.

1373
01:20:17,063 --> 01:20:19,023
- Sure, I can.
- <i>Well, why?</i>

1374
01:20:19,107 --> 01:20:21,609
'Cause while we're here talking,
he's out there getting it done.

1375
01:20:29,242 --> 01:20:31,285
Oh, shit!

1376
01:20:32,787 --> 01:20:34,247
He's got brake fade.

1377
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:42,755
Ease off!

1378
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:54,142
<i>Carroll?</i>

1379
01:20:54,517 --> 01:20:55,601
- Get him out!
- Peter!

1380
01:20:55,685 --> 01:20:57,478
Go on. Go inside.

1381
01:20:57,562 --> 01:20:58,604
Just stay there.

1382
01:20:58,688 --> 01:21:00,064
- Get Ken!
- Ken!

1383
01:21:00,148 --> 01:21:01,357
Get him out!

1384
01:21:03,276 --> 01:21:04,277
There he is!

1385
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,319
Ken!

1386
01:21:05,403 --> 01:21:06,571
I can see him.

1387
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:14,287
- Ken!
- Come on.

1388
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:22,170
The brakes.

1389
01:21:31,846 --> 01:21:34,766
Let's just rip out
the damn engine. All right?

1390
01:21:34,849 --> 01:21:37,518
We can't use it if we can't stop.

1391
01:21:37,602 --> 01:21:39,062
You know,
the brakes would last longer

1392
01:21:39,145 --> 01:21:40,646
if we slowed down a bit.

1393
01:21:41,022 --> 01:21:43,316
Wouldn't that defeat the whole
purpose of the extra power?

1394
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:46,611
You know, I thought the whole point
was to win the damned race.

1395
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:49,655
Maybe we could design
a new assembly.

1396
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:53,326
Instead of swapping out
the pads in the pits...

1397
01:21:53,868 --> 01:21:56,454
swap out the entire braking system.

1398
01:21:56,537 --> 01:21:57,914
Rotors included.

1399
01:21:58,664 --> 01:21:59,874
Put in a fresh one.

1400
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:02,960
Wait, wait, wait, Pops,
are we allowed to do that?

1401
01:22:03,044 --> 01:22:06,005
I don't know. I don't read French.

1402
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:12,678
Well, brakes are "a part"
like any other, right?

1403
01:22:12,762 --> 01:22:15,223
We are allowed to change parts.

1404
01:22:15,306 --> 01:22:17,183
Yes.
Will we have time to do that?

1405
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:18,726
I don't know yet, Charlie.

1406
01:22:19,519 --> 01:22:22,313
- I'm gonna take him home.
- All right.

1407
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:24,607
- Sort this shit out.
- I will.

1408
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,410
Have you ever been on fire?

1409
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:42,291
Uh, well, no, it's never happened to me.

1410
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:49,799
The suit's flameproof, see?

1411
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:51,300
It, uh, keeps heat out.

1412
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:53,302
Yeah.

1413
01:22:55,096 --> 01:22:58,724
But Lewis-Evans burned to death
in the Moroccan Grand Prix.

1414
01:22:58,850 --> 01:23:00,810
He had a flameproof suit on.

1415
01:23:02,145 --> 01:23:04,897
Mm-hmm. Yeah, but, um...

1416
01:23:07,942 --> 01:23:09,360
See, he got stuck.

1417
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:10,736
He couldn't breathe.

1418
01:23:12,113 --> 01:23:15,324
So, as long as you get out
of the car, you're okay.

1419
01:23:19,579 --> 01:23:21,038
Dad got out.

1420
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:23,958
- He sure did.
- Peter!

1421
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:29,130
Bye.

1422
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:31,340
See ya.

1423
01:23:34,135 --> 01:23:35,595
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1424
01:23:36,888 --> 01:23:38,014
What's wrong with you?

1425
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:42,894
And don't be telling me brakes
or me almost kicking the bucket out there.

1426
01:23:42,977 --> 01:23:45,104
It's something to do
with the suits, isn't it?

1427
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,150
It's under control.

1428
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:50,610
What is it?

1429
01:23:50,693 --> 01:23:52,236
You know how we talked about
how you do your thing,

1430
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,446
I do my thing?

1431
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:54,822
- This is my thing.
- Really, Shel--

1432
01:23:54,906 --> 01:23:56,199
Just trust me, Ken.

1433
01:23:57,074 --> 01:23:58,242
You got a plan?

1434
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,244
Absolutely.

1435
01:24:00,912 --> 01:24:01,913
It a good one?

1436
01:24:02,914 --> 01:24:04,290
It's high risk.

1437
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:05,458
How high risk?

1438
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:06,876
Extremely high risk.

1439
01:24:08,836 --> 01:24:10,087
Well, that's something.

1440
01:24:11,047 --> 01:24:12,882
- Glad we had this talk.
- Anytime.

1441
01:24:25,228 --> 01:24:27,521
Mr. Ford, this is a surprise.

1442
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:30,942
Apologies for the unannounced
intrusion, Mr. Shelby,

1443
01:24:31,025 --> 01:24:34,320
but when a man pays $9 million
for an automobile,

1444
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:36,239
he ought to at least be able to see it.

1445
01:24:36,322 --> 01:24:37,823
Well, that sounds reasonable enough.

1446
01:24:37,907 --> 01:24:39,742
Uh, Shelby, could I have a word?

1447
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:41,077
Sure.

1448
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:42,954
- In private?
- Uh, yeah.

1449
01:24:43,037 --> 01:24:44,580
That would be preferable.

1450
01:24:44,664 --> 01:24:45,873
All right. Hey, Phil.

1451
01:24:45,957 --> 01:24:47,541
You wanna take care of Mr. Ford here?

1452
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:49,252
Mr. Ford, that's Phil Remington.

1453
01:24:49,335 --> 01:24:50,378
Of course.

1454
01:24:50,461 --> 01:24:51,504
Come up to my office, Leo.

1455
01:24:51,587 --> 01:24:52,755
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Phil.

1456
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:54,799
Give you a little tour of your car.

1457
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:58,678
We, uh, took out your 289 small block...

1458
01:24:59,428 --> 01:25:01,722
and put in a 4277-liter.

1459
01:25:04,558 --> 01:25:06,978
Uh, firstly, I want to just clear the air.

1460
01:25:07,061 --> 01:25:09,313
I hope that whatever disagreements

1461
01:25:09,397 --> 01:25:11,232
between us can just be chalked up...

1462
01:25:11,983 --> 01:25:14,610
to natural red-bloodedness
in the heat of battle.

1463
01:25:14,694 --> 01:25:17,321
Oh, I appreciate that, Leo. Truly, I do.

1464
01:25:19,073 --> 01:25:23,619
It falls on me, Shelby, to inform you
that I have been appointed

1465
01:25:23,703 --> 01:25:26,455
overall executive director
of the racing program.

1466
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:31,544
Now, I do hope that this
won't be a problem between us.

1467
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:34,630
Well, I assure you, Leo, it will not.

1468
01:25:45,016 --> 01:25:46,100
Hey, Carroll...

1469
01:25:46,726 --> 01:25:47,727
Carroll!

1470
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:50,229
And what is that top speed
with the, uh, 427?

1471
01:25:50,313 --> 01:25:52,148
Well, why don't we take it for a spin?

1472
01:25:52,231 --> 01:25:53,733
- What?
- Yeah, go on, Mr. Ford.

1473
01:25:53,816 --> 01:25:56,193
- Hop on in. Go on.
- You want me to...

1474
01:25:56,277 --> 01:25:58,321
Just see
what $9 million feels like.

1475
01:25:58,404 --> 01:26:00,740
Hey!

1476
01:26:00,823 --> 01:26:02,116
God...

1477
01:26:05,703 --> 01:26:06,787
Open the door!

1478
01:26:06,871 --> 01:26:08,414
Hey, open the door!

1479
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:10,791
Open the door!

1480
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:15,880
Just hold me right there,
and you take my hand.

1481
01:26:17,715 --> 01:26:20,593
Oh, God. I sat on my nuts.

1482
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:22,428
We're gonna build the next one
for comfort. Don't you worry.

1483
01:26:31,354 --> 01:26:32,813
Open the door.

1484
01:26:32,897 --> 01:26:34,231
Sorry, sir, if you just give me a moment.

1485
01:26:34,315 --> 01:26:35,399
- Open the door.
- It's a sticky one.

1486
01:26:35,483 --> 01:26:37,234
You ready?

1487
01:26:37,318 --> 01:26:38,944
The name on the middle
of that steering wheel

1488
01:26:39,028 --> 01:26:41,364
should tell you that I was
born ready, Shelby. Hit it.

1489
01:26:41,447 --> 01:26:43,574
Attaboy.

1490
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:48,496
Whoa! It's got a little kick, doesn't it?

1491
01:26:48,913 --> 01:26:50,831
- Open this door.
- Oh, there we go.

1492
01:26:50,915 --> 01:26:52,958
Good God, Mr. Beebe. You okay, sir?

1493
01:26:55,044 --> 01:26:57,254
Whoa! Oh, my God!

1494
01:26:58,506 --> 01:27:01,092
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1495
01:27:04,887 --> 01:27:06,389
Yeah, baby.

1496
01:27:06,472 --> 01:27:09,016
Yeah, baby.

1497
01:27:12,186 --> 01:27:16,565
It's about right now the uninitiated
have a tendency to soil themselves.

1498
01:27:23,531 --> 01:27:26,242
Oh, my God! Whoa!

1499

1500
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:03,863
Mr. Ford...

1501
01:28:07,825 --> 01:28:09,285
You okay?

1502
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:13,706
Mr. Ford...

1503
01:28:14,457 --> 01:28:15,583
you all right?

1504
01:28:15,666 --> 01:28:16,917
I had no idea.

1505
01:28:19,587 --> 01:28:20,921
I had no idea.

1506
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:25,301
I wish my daddy...

1507
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:27,386
he were alive to see this.

1508
01:28:27,761 --> 01:28:30,306
To feel this.

1509
01:28:32,224 --> 01:28:34,143
Now, this is not a machine
just anybody can get in

1510
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:35,436
and easily control.

1511
01:28:35,519 --> 01:28:36,770
Absolutely not.

1512
01:28:37,605 --> 01:28:38,689
I had no idea.

1513
01:28:38,772 --> 01:28:40,024
Now, you wanna win Le Mans.

1514
01:28:40,983 --> 01:28:43,903
If you really wanna take first place,
Ken Miles is the man to do it.

1515
01:28:53,162 --> 01:28:54,497
Good timing.

1516
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:55,664
<i>Now, he knows this car</i>

1517
01:28:55,748 --> 01:28:57,208
because he helped me build it.

1518
01:28:58,751 --> 01:29:03,088
Shelby, you know I've already
appointed Leo Beebe director of racing.

1519
01:29:03,172 --> 01:29:05,007
Which is exactly why I'm talking to you.

1520
01:29:06,175 --> 01:29:08,761
Now, you let Ken Miles race Daytona.

1521
01:29:09,553 --> 01:29:10,846
If he wins...

1522
01:29:11,889 --> 01:29:13,474
he gets to drive Le Mans.

1523
01:29:16,143 --> 01:29:17,353
And if he doesn't?

1524
01:29:18,354 --> 01:29:21,941
Ford Motor Company gets full ownership
of Shelby American.

1525
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:23,484
Lock, stock, and brand.

1526
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:24,610
Forever.

1527
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:30,741
<i>We're in
hour six at the Daytona 24,</i>

1528
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:33,410
<i>and Fords are dominating the leader board.</i>

1529
01:29:34,161 --> 01:29:37,248
<i>Shelby American's Ken Miles
holds a narrow lead</i>

1530
01:29:37,331 --> 01:29:40,125
<i>over the Holman-Moody Ford
driven by Walt Hansgen.</i>

1531
01:29:41,252 --> 01:29:43,420
I don't bloody think so, Walt.

1532
01:30:02,064 --> 01:30:05,109
Oh, this race is not just
a test of our cars,

1533
01:30:05,192 --> 01:30:06,569
but also our teams.

1534
01:30:06,652 --> 01:30:08,696
As you know, we have
a second team out there today.

1535
01:30:08,779 --> 01:30:10,364
- Holman-Moody.
- That's right.

1536
01:30:11,115 --> 01:30:14,076
<i>Number 95, Hansgen,
blisters through the front tri-oval</i>

1537
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:16,161
<i>while closing in on Ken Miles.</i>

1538
01:30:16,245 --> 01:30:17,663
Walt's pushing her too fast.

1539
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:20,040
He's pushing 7,000 RPM.

1540
01:30:20,124 --> 01:30:21,542
Hey, get the EZ sign out there.

1541
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:23,377
Come on. Move. Do it now.

1542
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:27,214
Every one of these GTs out there today
is under my direct supervision.

1543
01:30:27,298 --> 01:30:30,301
And of course the supervision
of Henry Ford ll.

1544
01:30:30,384 --> 01:30:33,220
The drivers, the speed, the strategy...

1545
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:36,640
even the RPMs are determined by us.

1546
01:30:40,477 --> 01:30:42,062
<i>Ken Miles
is locked in a pitched battle</i>

1547
01:30:42,146 --> 01:30:45,024
<i>with Hansgen as they pass the grandstand.</i>

1548
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:51,155
<i>Hansgen is taking a run
at Miles entering turn one.</i>

1549
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:52,531
<i>Miles is boxed in.</i>

1550
01:30:52,615 --> 01:30:56,869
<i>Hansgen slips by and takes the lead
approaching the infield chicane.</i>

1551
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:07,921
Cor blimey!

1552
01:31:08,005 --> 01:31:09,006
Did you see that?

1553
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:10,758
<i>The caution flag is out.</i>

1554
01:31:17,431 --> 01:31:19,975
Still racing. Hey, we are still racing.

1555
01:31:20,059 --> 01:31:21,060
Come on, guys, let's go!

1556
01:31:21,143 --> 01:31:22,144
Let's go. Move it.

1557
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:23,187
He's coming in.

1558
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:26,357
Let's go, let's go, guys. Come on.

1559
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:27,816
Go, tires up.

1560
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,526
Here, right here.
Let's go. Let's go. Move it.

1561
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:31,487
- Fuel flying in.
- Breaker bar!

1562
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:33,113
- We're good.
- It all checked out.

1563
01:31:33,197 --> 01:31:34,907
- 36. 38.
- Go! Go!

1564
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:37,409
Hansgen is right up our arse.

1565
01:31:37,493 --> 01:31:39,161
If I can just get
outta the pit ahead of him...

1566
01:31:39,244 --> 01:31:41,872
She's running hot,
but I think she'll hold.

1567
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:43,415
- Fuel's low.
- Bring up the scoop.

1568
01:31:43,499 --> 01:31:44,583
She's hot.

1569
01:31:47,002 --> 01:31:48,879
Hey there, Walt. Good to see you.

1570
01:31:48,962 --> 01:31:51,882
Yeah, after I get out of this pit, Shelby,
it's the last time you will.

1571
01:31:51,965 --> 01:31:52,966
Oh, don't worry.

1572
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:54,176
We got rearview mirrors.

1573
01:31:55,719 --> 01:31:57,388
What happened to that Mustang he took out?

1574
01:31:58,138 --> 01:31:59,598
Don't know yet.

1575
01:31:59,682 --> 01:32:02,476
I can push her harder than six, Shel.

1576
01:32:02,559 --> 01:32:04,770
- I can feel it.
- Uh-huh.

1577
01:32:08,524 --> 01:32:12,403
Hey, how come these guys pit
so much faster than we do?

1578
01:32:12,486 --> 01:32:16,031
They got a goddamn
NASCAR crew, that's why.

1579
01:32:16,115 --> 01:32:17,783
- No shit?
- No shit.

1580
01:32:18,409 --> 01:32:20,119
Go! Go, come on.

1581
01:32:21,578 --> 01:32:23,288
We're clear, we're clear.

1582
01:32:23,372 --> 01:32:24,540
Goddamn NASCAR crew.

1583
01:32:24,623 --> 01:32:26,166
Go, go, go!

1584
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:28,293
Guys, they've already left.

1585
01:32:31,088 --> 01:32:32,214
Hello?

1586
01:32:32,297 --> 01:32:34,174
<i>There's my Mollie. Hello.</i>

1587
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:36,009
Hiya, love.

1588
01:32:36,093 --> 01:32:37,928
- Mom? Mom?
- <i>What are you doing?</i>

1589
01:32:38,011 --> 01:32:39,054
Just having a cuppa.

1590
01:32:39,138 --> 01:32:40,764
Mom, ask him about the brakes.

1591
01:32:40,848 --> 01:32:43,142
- Go to bed. It's 1 :00 a.m.
- Ask him.

1592
01:32:43,225 --> 01:32:44,685
Go to bed. Now.

1593
01:32:44,768 --> 01:32:46,562
I take it he's not asleep.

1594
01:32:46,645 --> 01:32:48,397
I'm sure he smuggled in a radio.

1595
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:49,857
<i>Yeah.</i>

1596
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:51,233
He said to ask, "How are the brakes?"

1597
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:53,152
The brakes? Yes. No, no, no.

1598
01:32:53,235 --> 01:32:55,320
Tell him they're working for now.

1599
01:32:55,404 --> 01:32:58,073
<i>You know, Shelby's been acting
very strange.</i>

1600
01:32:58,157 --> 01:32:59,283
- <i>Ford have gone...</i>
- Ken.

1601
01:32:59,366 --> 01:33:00,576
<i>...and put up another team.</i>

1602
01:33:00,659 --> 01:33:02,035
- With a GT.
- <i>Ken.</i>

1603
01:33:02,119 --> 01:33:05,456
Some sort of yampy, bloody
corporate test or something, I dunno.

1604
01:33:05,539 --> 01:33:07,583
Just take a rest
whenever you get a chance.

1605
01:33:07,666 --> 01:33:09,001
<i>Sorry, my love, what were you saying?</i>

1606
01:33:09,084 --> 01:33:10,502
You've only got a few hours.

1607
01:33:10,586 --> 01:33:11,754
<i>I can't hear you very well.</i>

1608
01:33:11,837 --> 01:33:13,088
<i>I'm sorry. I can't hear you.</i>

1609
01:33:13,172 --> 01:33:14,381
<i>Wish me luck.</i>

1610
01:33:14,465 --> 01:33:16,133
- Good luck.
- <i>I love you, darling.</i>

1611
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,052
<i>After 23 hours
here at Daytona,</i>

1612
01:33:19,136 --> 01:33:21,472
<i>Walt Hansgen driving
the green and white Ford</i>

1613
01:33:21,555 --> 01:33:25,476
<i>has a commanding lead
over Ken Miles and Shelby American</i>

1614
01:33:25,559 --> 01:33:28,353
<i>as the rest of the field
has fallen off the pace.</i>

1615
01:33:28,437 --> 01:33:29,521
We're locked out.

1616
01:33:29,605 --> 01:33:32,483
Ain't nothing Miles can do
this late in the race.

1617
01:33:33,192 --> 01:33:35,652
Engine's hot. We gotta keep it
under six thou.

1618
01:34:23,367 --> 01:34:24,910
All right.

1619
01:34:50,227 --> 01:34:51,979
She could come apart.

1620
01:34:52,062 --> 01:34:53,438
One way to find out.

1621
01:34:56,567 --> 01:34:58,694
I thought we were keeping him under 6,000?

1622
01:34:59,236 --> 01:35:00,612
Shut up, Don.

1623
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:12,749
<i>With only minutes
of racing left here at Daytona,</i>

1624
01:35:12,833 --> 01:35:14,793
<i>a pitched battle for the lead
is being waged</i>

1625
01:35:14,877 --> 01:35:17,796
<i>as the number 98 Ford makes
an incredible late surge.</i>

1626
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:20,007
- What's happening?
- He's moving up.

1627
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:21,300
COMMENTATOR
<i>...entering the front tri-oval,</i>

1628
01:35:21,383 --> 01:35:23,594
<i>Ken Miles' desperate bid
for the win may prove to be...</i>

1629
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:33,145
Come on now!

1630
01:35:33,228 --> 01:35:34,938
White flag! Last lap!

1631
01:35:40,611 --> 01:35:42,696
Miles is pushing him. Hard.

1632
01:35:53,373 --> 01:35:54,917
That's it, girl.

1633
01:36:05,802 --> 01:36:09,056
<i>Ken Miles drafts Walt Hansgen
coming into the final turn.</i>

1634
01:36:35,624 --> 01:36:36,667
Come on. Come on.

1635
01:36:40,003 --> 01:36:42,214
What the hell?

1636
01:36:49,972 --> 01:36:51,139
Come on.

1637
01:36:51,598 --> 01:36:52,724
All right.

1638
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:58,397
Look at this now.

1639
01:37:03,235 --> 01:37:04,403
Damn it!

1640
01:37:12,369 --> 01:37:13,996
Yeah!

1641
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:16,289
<i>Ken Miles
takes the checkered flag,</i>

1642
01:37:16,373 --> 01:37:18,125
<i>bringing glory to Shelby American.</i>

1643
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:22,379
How about that?

1644
01:37:32,848 --> 01:37:34,766
Reliability, strength...

1645
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:35,767
Yes, Leo.

1646
01:37:35,851 --> 01:37:37,644
<i>Mr. Ford, sir, we won.</i>

1647
01:37:38,895 --> 01:37:39,896
Uh-huh.

1648
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:42,190
We won! Ford won Daytona.

1649
01:37:42,274 --> 01:37:44,026
Hot damn.

1650
01:37:44,109 --> 01:37:45,652
And which team was it, Leo?

1651
01:37:47,195 --> 01:37:49,614
Shelby American. Miles driving.

1652
01:37:51,366 --> 01:37:52,701
Son of a bitch.

1653
01:37:53,702 --> 01:37:55,203
All right.

1654
01:37:55,287 --> 01:37:56,621
Where the hell is he?

1655
01:37:56,705 --> 01:37:58,707
Hang on, I see him. Hey, wait.

1656
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:00,959
Someone lost a bulldog on the beach.

1657
01:38:02,627 --> 01:38:04,379
No, no. Come on. Come on.

1658
01:38:05,464 --> 01:38:08,633
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1659
01:38:08,717 --> 01:38:11,261
Someone get this man a drink.
Someone get him a drink.

1660
01:38:27,152 --> 01:38:28,111
Oi.

1661
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:31,323
In bed, you. What are you doing?

1662
01:38:32,074 --> 01:38:33,408
Dirty stop out.

1663
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:34,951
I was...

1664
01:38:35,994 --> 01:38:38,580
drawing a map, so I could
follow you on Le Mans.

1665
01:38:39,206 --> 01:38:40,248
Mmm.

1666
01:38:42,584 --> 01:38:44,252
Look at that.

1667
01:38:45,754 --> 01:38:47,464
That is spot on.

1668
01:38:47,547 --> 01:38:49,549
You are a dab hand, very accurate.

1669
01:38:51,593 --> 01:38:53,095
Tell me about the track.

1670
01:38:53,178 --> 01:38:54,846
No, I can't, Petey.

1671
01:38:54,930 --> 01:38:55,931
Please.

1672
01:39:04,815 --> 01:39:06,733
Well, you start at the start line.

1673
01:39:07,567 --> 01:39:09,486
Yeah, but you actually start here

1674
01:39:09,569 --> 01:39:11,571
because you have to run
to your car at Le Mans.

1675
01:39:11,655 --> 01:39:13,073
True enough.

1676
01:39:13,156 --> 01:39:16,284
So, once your old man manages
to hobble over...

1677
01:39:17,035 --> 01:39:19,412
- and pull out...
- And not hit anyone.

1678
01:39:19,496 --> 01:39:21,414
Yes, right.

1679
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:25,752
Then you accelerate very hard
up to Dunlop Bridge...

1680
01:39:26,753 --> 01:39:28,672
road banking away from ya

1681
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:31,591
and down through the trees to the Esses...

1682
01:39:31,675 --> 01:39:33,802
and accelerate up to Tertre Rouge.

1683
01:39:33,885 --> 01:39:35,929
Critical first gear corner.

1684
01:39:36,596 --> 01:39:37,806
Fast entry.

1685
01:39:38,306 --> 01:39:40,851
Keep your speed up for your exit onto...

1686
01:39:42,018 --> 01:39:43,186
Mulsanne.

1687
01:39:43,812 --> 01:39:46,565
Long straightaway, hemmed in by poplars.

1688
01:39:46,648 --> 01:39:49,734
Top gear, 210 miles per hour.

1689
01:39:50,193 --> 01:39:52,320
And down to third, revs up.

1690
01:39:52,404 --> 01:39:53,780
Revs are your friend.

1691
01:39:54,698 --> 01:39:58,201
Get a maximum exit. Let the car run free.

1692
01:39:58,285 --> 01:40:00,203
Over the brow...

1693
01:40:00,287 --> 01:40:01,371
then wham!

1694
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:04,374
Mulsanne Corner.

1695
01:40:04,457 --> 01:40:07,085
Accelerate to Arnage

1696
01:40:07,169 --> 01:40:08,670
and then over the rise to the White House.

1697
01:40:08,753 --> 01:40:10,630
You get that right and...

1698
01:40:14,009 --> 01:40:16,094
Your first three and a half minutes...

1699
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:18,638
of 24 hours.

1700
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:26,396
But... you can't make every lap perfect.

1701
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:28,899
But I can try.

1702
01:40:34,738 --> 01:40:36,072
All right.

1703
01:40:37,115 --> 01:40:38,450
Off to bed, you.

1704
01:40:41,203 --> 01:40:43,914
I will... wake you...

1705
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:46,333
before I leave for France.

1706
01:40:47,167 --> 01:40:48,168
I promise.

1707
01:40:48,668 --> 01:40:50,837
Okay. Good night.

1708
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:20,116
Eh, where's, um...

1709
01:41:20,992 --> 01:41:23,745
Where's that? The Hotel Saint Pierre?

1710
01:41:25,163 --> 01:41:26,456
Where?

1711
01:42:12,794 --> 01:42:14,587
It's gonna rain again tomorrow.

1712
01:42:20,010 --> 01:42:21,553
There's always rain here.

1713
01:42:25,015 --> 01:42:26,599
Start'll be dry though,

1714
01:42:26,683 --> 01:42:29,853
so we'll swap out your tires come rain.

1715
01:42:32,522 --> 01:42:33,940
Yeah.

1716
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:40,613
Might be smart to sleep, Bulldog.

1717
01:42:42,657 --> 01:42:44,159
Well, you, too.

1718
01:42:44,951 --> 01:42:46,077
I'm not driving.

1719
01:42:48,955 --> 01:42:52,083
That's a bloody shame, that.

1720
01:42:52,459 --> 01:42:54,210
Oh, hell, I couldn't make this team.

1721
01:42:59,466 --> 01:43:01,301
I'm gonna go walk the first corner.

1722
01:43:03,261 --> 01:43:04,763
I figured.

1723
01:43:15,648 --> 01:43:16,775
Counting on it.

1724
01:43:51,643 --> 01:43:52,936
Ken.

1725
01:43:53,019 --> 01:43:54,354
Chaz.

1726
01:44:00,026 --> 01:44:01,194
We'll change
the color of them seats,

1727
01:44:01,277 --> 01:44:02,278
shall we, Frost?

1728
01:44:08,451 --> 01:44:10,662
Well, if this were
a beauty pageant...

1729
01:44:11,204 --> 01:44:12,622
we just lost.

1730
01:44:13,790 --> 01:44:14,874
Looks fast, don't it?

1731
01:44:14,958 --> 01:44:17,335
Ah, looks aren't everything.

1732
01:44:21,589 --> 01:44:24,467
Scarfiotti and Bandini start for Ferrari.

1733
01:44:30,306 --> 01:44:31,558
You can take him.

1734
01:44:31,641 --> 01:44:33,893
Four minutes, Ken.
Four minutes, buddy.

1735
01:44:33,977 --> 01:44:35,228
<i>Live from Le Mans, France.</i>

1736
01:44:35,311 --> 01:44:37,439
Mom! Come on.

1737
01:44:37,522 --> 01:44:39,107
All right, coming.

1738
01:44:39,941 --> 01:44:42,485
<i>The 24 Hours of Le Mans.</i>

1739
01:44:42,569 --> 01:44:44,070
<i>And there are the cars lined up...</i>

1740
01:44:47,157 --> 01:44:49,159
<i>Drivers,
please take your places.</i>

1741
01:45:08,136 --> 01:45:09,137
- <i>And there they are...</i>
- There he is.

1742
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:10,680
<i>...lined up, ready to go.</i>

1743
01:45:10,763 --> 01:45:12,182
<i>They're lined up
as per their practice times.</i>

1744
01:45:12,265 --> 01:45:13,475
<i>Faster cars are up to our left.</i>

1745
01:46:04,817 --> 01:46:06,819
Oh, bloody joker!

1746
01:46:12,283 --> 01:46:14,536
<i>Number 10, a Bizzarrini,
almost loses control.</i>

1747
01:46:15,203 --> 01:46:16,663
It's all right.

1748
01:46:19,165 --> 01:46:20,708
You looked great out there, sir.

1749
01:46:21,834 --> 01:46:23,169
What happened to Miles?

1750
01:46:31,886 --> 01:46:33,721
Bloody hell.

1751
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:36,558
No.

1752
01:46:43,273 --> 01:46:45,149
Poxy bastard.

1753
01:47:21,019 --> 01:47:24,897
<i>After one lap,
Bandini-Ferrari is in first place.</i>

1754
01:47:28,693 --> 01:47:30,361
Where is Miles?

1755
01:47:32,572 --> 01:47:34,616
- Where the hell is Ken?
- I don't know.

1756
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:44,751
He's coming in.

1757
01:47:44,834 --> 01:47:45,960
Oi! He's coming in.

1758
01:47:46,044 --> 01:47:47,170
He's coming in. Let's go.

1759
01:47:47,253 --> 01:47:48,755
Frosty, come on. Let's go. Move it.

1760
01:47:49,422 --> 01:47:51,049
I think it's his door.

1761
01:47:51,132 --> 01:47:53,134
<i>That's a rough start
for the Ford team so early...</i>

1762
01:47:56,679 --> 01:47:59,891
The bloody door won't close!

1763
01:47:59,974 --> 01:48:02,101
All right. All right.
We'll take care of it.

1764
01:48:02,185 --> 01:48:03,436
Come on, guys.

1765
01:48:03,519 --> 01:48:04,646
Damn door!

1766
01:48:05,229 --> 01:48:06,648
- Try that.
- This'll do it.

1767
01:48:06,731 --> 01:48:08,066
Shelby, what the hell is wrong?

1768
01:48:08,733 --> 01:48:09,817
Something's hitting the frame.

1769
01:48:09,901 --> 01:48:11,778
Oh, you're joking, aren't ya?

1770
01:48:12,528 --> 01:48:14,113
Guys, get outta the way.

1771
01:48:14,197 --> 01:48:15,531
Just get outta the way. Hold it.

1772
01:48:17,075 --> 01:48:19,077
Go! Go, go, go!

1773
01:48:27,043 --> 01:48:27,960
He's back out.

1774
01:48:28,044 --> 01:48:29,045
Go.

1775
01:48:51,734 --> 01:48:53,695
<i>Ken Miles,
in Shelby American's</i>

1776
01:48:53,778 --> 01:48:55,863
<i>Ford number 1, in tenth place.</i>

1777
01:48:55,947 --> 01:48:58,616
<i>Tremendous gains
for Ken Miles in Ford number 1.</i>

1778
01:48:58,700 --> 01:49:00,910
- Come on, Dad. Come on.
- <i>Passing Porsche 43.</i>

1779
01:49:00,993 --> 01:49:02,787
<i>Moving quickly into the
top 20. He's passing them...</i>

1780
01:49:09,669 --> 01:49:12,380
<i>Ken Miles, Ford,
has set a new lap record.</i>

1781
01:49:12,463 --> 01:49:14,465
<i>Three minutes and 34 seconds.</i>

1782
01:49:14,549 --> 01:49:15,842
Yeah!

1783
01:49:15,925 --> 01:49:17,802
<i>Ken Miles passed it
with a time of 3:</i><i>34.3.</i>

1784
01:49:30,273 --> 01:49:31,774
Shelby.

1785
01:49:31,858 --> 01:49:34,777
He's pushing the car too hard.
That's not the plan.

1786
01:49:35,611 --> 01:49:36,863
Plans change.

1787
01:50:04,265 --> 01:50:07,518
Lap is 3:34. Track is 8.36.

1788
01:50:07,602 --> 01:50:09,645
Someone tell me the miles per hour!

1789
01:50:18,946 --> 01:50:20,948
<i>Three minutes, 31.9.</i>

1790
01:50:21,032 --> 01:50:22,241
- Another lap record!
- <i>That's an average speed</i>

1791
01:50:22,325 --> 01:50:24,786
<i>of 142.01 miles per hour.</i>

1792
01:50:27,997 --> 01:50:29,749
Let's go. Let's go, boys.

1793
01:50:29,832 --> 01:50:31,417
Tea's ready, Ken.

1794
01:50:31,501 --> 01:50:32,919
Oh, thank you, Chaz.

1795
01:50:33,586 --> 01:50:36,506
- Happy birthday, old chap!
- Cheers, mate. Great run.

1796
01:50:37,715 --> 01:50:38,925
Go, boys. Move, move, move.

1797
01:50:41,761 --> 01:50:43,304
Need a quick body check!

1798
01:50:45,973 --> 01:50:47,975
You're three seconds faster than Gurney.

1799
01:50:48,059 --> 01:50:49,977
If you hadn't blown the start,
you'd be in the lead.

1800
01:50:50,061 --> 01:50:51,395
Can you keep this up?

1801
01:50:51,479 --> 01:50:53,231
Can the car?

1802
01:50:55,399 --> 01:50:57,777
<i>There has been
an incident on turn six.</i>

1803
01:50:57,860 --> 01:51:00,404
<i>Number 18 and 26 have collided.</i>

1804
01:51:25,763 --> 01:51:27,640
<i>It appears Ferrari number 20,</i>

1805
01:51:27,723 --> 01:51:30,935
<i>Ludovico Scarfiotti,
has also left the track.</i>

1806
01:51:39,902 --> 01:51:41,737
- All right, watch your head.
- Here you go.

1807
01:51:41,821 --> 01:51:43,030
Thank you.

1808
01:51:43,114 --> 01:51:44,824
Have a good dinner, sir.

1809
01:51:45,741 --> 01:51:47,285
Oi, McLaren's pitting.

1810
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:53,541
Mr. Ford's probably going
somewhere nice for dinner.

1811
01:51:53,624 --> 01:51:55,334
What do you mean "probably"?

1812
01:51:55,418 --> 01:51:56,794
Rain's coming.

1813
01:51:56,878 --> 01:51:58,296
All right.

1814
01:52:13,853 --> 01:52:15,187
Coming in.

1815
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:19,483
Go, tires up!

1816
01:52:22,486 --> 01:52:23,487
Get 'em checked out.

1817
01:52:23,571 --> 01:52:25,489
Engine's running hot, Pops.

1818
01:52:25,573 --> 01:52:27,366
- All right.
- She's hot, mate. Crack on.

1819
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:28,993
- Go.
- Well done, Denny.

1820
01:52:30,578 --> 01:52:31,787
Tire.

1821
01:52:32,663 --> 01:52:33,706
Dash clear.

1822
01:52:34,665 --> 01:52:35,791
Swap.

1823
01:52:38,628 --> 01:52:40,087
We're at 220. We're okay.

1824
01:52:40,588 --> 01:52:41,756
All right.

1825
01:52:41,839 --> 01:52:43,341
Fuel flying in.

1826
01:52:43,424 --> 01:52:44,967
Rear tires coming up the wall!

1827
01:52:45,051 --> 01:52:46,260
Get the fuel in there.
Come on. Let's go.

1828
01:52:46,344 --> 01:52:47,345
Swap that out.

1829
01:52:49,555 --> 01:52:50,640
Front set.

1830
01:52:51,223 --> 01:52:52,475
We're good.

1831
01:52:56,354 --> 01:52:57,939
- Get it moving!
- Go! Go!

1832
01:52:58,522 --> 01:52:59,690
Go, go!

1833
01:53:04,153 --> 01:53:05,404
Good job, guys. Good job.

1834
01:53:05,488 --> 01:53:07,156
It was a good change, fellas.

1835
01:53:07,239 --> 01:53:08,407
Hey, I need a stopwatch.

1836
01:53:22,964 --> 01:53:29,929
Did you see that? The great American automobile magnate
leaves in a helicopter. Very classy.

1837
01:53:38,813 --> 01:53:42,858
<i>Lorenzo Bandini remains

1838
01:53:57,748 --> 01:53:59,667
Easy, Dan. You're getting boxed in.

1839
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:01,669
He's not batting
on a full wicket, that one.

1840
01:54:07,466 --> 01:54:08,759
Easy, Dan.

1841
01:54:10,845 --> 01:54:12,013
Oh, bloody hell!

1842
01:54:13,639 --> 01:54:15,307
You arsehole.

1843
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:33,492
Oh, piss off!

1844
01:54:36,871 --> 01:54:38,456
You wanker!

1845
01:54:44,962 --> 01:54:48,966
A face like a smacked arse,

Go, Ken. Come on, Ken.

1849
01:55:17,369 --> 01:55:19,080
Nice stopwatch.

1850
01:55:19,705 --> 01:55:21,499
You want one? They're Italian.

1854
01:55:53,489 --> 01:55:56,242
<i>And now with all that rain,

1855
01:55:56,325 --> 01:55:58,744
<i>so expect these very fast laps to suffer.</i>

1856
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:02,665
Yes, sir?

1857
01:56:04,083 --> 01:56:05,126
Yes, sir.

1858
01:56:05,543 --> 01:56:06,752
Yes, sir.

1859
01:56:07,837 --> 01:56:09,630
Okay, sir. Right away, sir.

01:56:16,137 --> 01:56:17,138
Hey!

What the hell are you doing? Give me that.

1862
01:56:23,144 --> 01:56:24,145
Dumbass.

1863
01:56:24,645 --> 01:56:25,813
Mr. Shelby...

1864
01:57:08,063 --> 01:57:08,981
Here we go.

01:57:14,111 --> 01:57:15,321
Come on.

1867
01:57:21,535 --> 01:57:22,953
Hold it together now.

01:57:37,718 --> 01:57:38,928
God!

1869
01:57:40,930 --> 01:57:42,640

1876
01:57:58,405 --> 01:58:00,866
- Brakes. Nothing. Gone.
- Yeah.

1877
01:58:00,950 --> 01:58:03,285
All right. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1878
01:58:04,954 --> 01:58:07,915
I had him. I almost had him.

1879
01:58:09,375 --> 01:58:11,794
Well, he's putting another lap on us now.

1880
01:58:11,877 --> 01:58:14,713
All right. Fit it in.
Do the upper arm first.

1881
01:58:14,797 --> 01:58:16,507
Come on, let's go.
Come in now, now. Faster.

1882

Let's go.

1883
01:58:17,675 --> 01:58:18,968
Upper arm first.

1884
01:58:19,718 --> 01:58:21,345
Watch the brake line pulling it out.

1885
01:58:21,428 --> 01:58:23,472
They're doing it. The brakes.

1886
01:58:23,555 --> 01:58:24,723
<i>Now, that's gonna take...</i>

1887
01:58:24,807 --> 01:58:26,392
I said watch the brake line.

1888
01:58:26,475 --> 01:58:28,269
Faster! Faster! Faster!

1889
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:29,436
Coming in. Watch your back!

1890
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:30,729
Jeff, you've gotta be faster!

1891
01:58:44,618 --> 01:58:45,661
Bleed the brakes, Jeff.

1892
01:58:45,744 --> 01:58:46,829
No, no, no.

1893
01:58:47,288 --> 01:58:49,748
It's against the rules.
You cannot just change things.

1894
01:58:49,832 --> 01:58:51,083
Oh, no, no, no.

1895
01:58:51,166 --> 01:58:54,962
You show me where it says in your book
that we cannot swap out the system,

1896
01:58:55,045 --> 01:58:56,088
and then you can disqualify us.

1897
01:58:56,171 --> 01:58:57,172
Bulldog, back off.

1898
01:58:57,256 --> 01:58:59,216
Calm down. Calm down.

1899
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:00,634
This is not legal.

1900
01:59:00,718 --> 01:59:02,428
You show me where it says
in that little rule book

1901
01:59:02,511 --> 01:59:04,680
where I can't swap out
my upright assembly.

1902
01:59:04,763 --> 01:59:06,223
A part is a part.

1903
01:59:06,307 --> 01:59:08,017
Be it a brake caliper, a rotor,
or an upright assembly,

1904
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:09,852
and I can swap out
any damn thing I want to.

1905
01:59:10,936 --> 01:59:12,479
We read your damn rule book.

1906
01:59:18,527 --> 01:59:20,446
Bandini's pitting.
He's pitting.

1907
01:59:27,661 --> 01:59:29,621
Oh, what a shame.

1908
01:59:29,705 --> 01:59:30,873
I think he blew a line.

1909
01:59:30,956 --> 01:59:32,082
Well, he was trying to keep up with you.

1910
01:59:42,551 --> 01:59:44,553
I don't speak Italian, but he ain't happy.

1911
01:59:56,106 --> 01:59:57,900
Get me out of here, Pops.

1912
01:59:57,983 --> 01:59:59,026

- All right.

1913
01:59:59,109 --> 02:00:00,444
Come on!

1914
02:00:00,527 --> 02:00:02,071
Almost there, Ken. Almost there.

1915
02:00:02,571 --> 02:00:03,614
How's it looking, buddy?

1916
02:00:03,697 --> 02:00:04,740
One pump, and we're good.

1917
02:00:05,366 --> 02:00:06,533
Car's yours, Ken.

1918
02:00:06,617 --> 02:00:09,078
All right, listen, you can still take him,
but you gotta pass him twice.

1919
02:00:09,161 --> 02:00:11,163
I get it. Pass him twice.

1920
02:00:18,212 --> 02:00:19,755

1921
02:00:19,838 --> 02:00:23,133

02:01:22,025 --> 02:01:25,028
Not bloody good enough, Miles! Come on!

1923
02:01:25,487 --> 02:01:26,822
He's off his pace.

1924
02:01:28,657 --> 02:01:30,492
He doesn't trust the car yet.

1925
02:01:31,076 --> 02:01:33,662
Come on, Ken.
I gave you new brakes, buddy.

1926
02:01:40,002 --> 02:01:41,211
All right.

1927
02:01:42,504 --> 02:01:44,423
What did you come here for?

1928
02:01:46,508 --> 02:01:47,718
Let's do it.

1929
02:02:12,284 --> 02:02:14,077
That's it! Come on!

1930
02:02:25,297 --> 02:02:26,507
He ain't done it yet.

1931
02:02:30,385 --> 02:02:32,346
He needs to take another lap on him.

1932
02:02:56,203 --> 02:02:57,871
He needs to pit soon.

1933
02:02:57,955 --> 02:03:00,290
He needs to catch Bandini first.

1934
02:03:10,467 --> 02:03:12,010
All right, you bastard.

1935
02:03:13,262 --> 02:03:14,555
Let's do this again.

1936
02:03:44,376 --> 02:03:45,586
Come on.

1937
02:03:46,295 --> 02:03:48,213
That's my girl! That's my girl!

1938
02:04:08,442 --> 02:04:11,028
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

1939
02:04:11,612 --> 02:04:12,904
Bloody hell!

1940
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:29,463
He did it. We're in the lead.

1941
02:04:29,546 --> 02:04:30,964
Are we in the lead?

1942
02:04:31,048 --> 02:04:32,674
What about Bandini?

1943
02:04:33,258 --> 02:04:34,509
Where's Bandini?

1944
02:04:35,302 --> 02:04:37,012
They're done. Finished.

1945
02:04:37,638 --> 02:04:39,014
Ferrari's over.

1946
02:04:39,097 --> 02:04:41,141
McLaren's four minutes behind him in a GT.

1947
02:04:41,224 --> 02:04:44,478
So we're lying Ken first,
and two and three. All Fords.

1948
02:05:00,369 --> 02:05:01,953
<i>Ferrari number 21</i>

1949
02:05:02,037 --> 02:05:04,331
<i>and driver Bandini have left the track.</i>

1950
02:05:06,667 --> 02:05:07,959
The Deuce is coming.

1951
02:05:17,302 --> 02:05:20,263
Ken's up in a half an hour.
Want me to wake him?

1952
02:05:20,347 --> 02:05:21,556
Nah, let him sleep.

1953
02:05:22,891 --> 02:05:24,643
- Thank you very much. Thank you.
- Unbelievable.

1954
02:05:24,726 --> 02:05:26,061
- Hello.
- Mr. Ford.

1955
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:27,187
We're not quite there yet, but...

1956
02:05:27,270 --> 02:05:28,605
You missed a good meal.

1957
02:05:28,689 --> 02:05:30,273
There he is. There he is.

1958
02:05:32,192 --> 02:05:33,443
Brief me, Leo.

1959
02:05:34,277 --> 02:05:36,363
We're running one, two, three, Mr. Ford.

1960
02:05:37,572 --> 02:05:40,283
- Who's in the lead?
- Hulme, Miles.

1961
02:05:42,661 --> 02:05:44,287
You know, I was thinking, Mr. Ford...

1962
02:05:45,372 --> 02:05:48,875
wouldn't it be great
if all three Fords lined up

1963
02:05:48,959 --> 02:05:50,877
and crossed the finish line
at the exact same time?

1964
02:05:51,712 --> 02:05:53,755
They all lined up and came home together.

1965
02:05:53,839 --> 02:05:55,924
Ford. Ford. Ford.

1966
02:05:56,675 --> 02:05:58,802
I don't think we can
actually do that, sir, but...

1967
02:06:00,137 --> 02:06:01,388
Why not?

1968
02:06:02,431 --> 02:06:04,683
Miles is laps ahead, Leo.

1969
02:06:04,766 --> 02:06:07,352
What would you have him do, slow down?

1970
02:06:08,770 --> 02:06:09,896
Yeah.

1971
02:06:17,028 --> 02:06:19,448
Mr. Ford wants Miles to slow down.

1972
02:06:19,531 --> 02:06:21,825
He wants all three cars to
cross at the exact same time.

1973
02:06:21,908 --> 02:06:23,827
He thinks it'll be
a historic moment for Ford.

1974
02:06:23,910 --> 02:06:25,537
It'll make a great photograph.

1975
02:06:27,205 --> 02:06:29,750
Shelby, Miles needs to be
a team player here,

1976
02:06:29,833 --> 02:06:31,293
and so do you.

1977
02:06:31,376 --> 02:06:33,086
You gonna tell him, or you need me to?

1978
02:06:34,755 --> 02:06:37,132
Don't go near my driver. Go on.

1979
02:06:38,216 --> 02:06:39,551
This is what Mr. Ford wants.

1980
02:06:39,634 --> 02:06:40,844
Go on now.

1981
02:06:41,428 --> 02:06:42,971
- He expects loyalty.
- Go on.

1982
02:07:00,071 --> 02:07:02,282
- Guys, let's go. Come on.
- All right, look lively, boys.

1983
02:07:02,365 --> 02:07:03,617
Let's go. Frosty.

1984
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:05,035
Yeah, coming.

1985
02:07:06,161 --> 02:07:08,997
- Let's go. Come on.
- What's Beebe want?

1986
02:07:13,460 --> 02:07:14,961
Oh.

1987
02:07:15,045 --> 02:07:16,797
It's off the scale, innit?

1988
02:07:22,302 --> 02:07:23,887
They want you to slow down.

1989
02:07:28,183 --> 02:07:29,559
Run that by me again.

1990
02:07:30,268 --> 02:07:31,603
They want you to slow down.

1991
02:07:34,523 --> 02:07:36,066
You're outshining their car, Ken.

1992
02:07:36,149 --> 02:07:37,859
You're four minutes up on McLaren.

1993
02:07:37,943 --> 02:07:39,402
The Deuce wants the three Fords

1994
02:07:39,486 --> 02:07:41,863
to cross the finish line
one, two, three, all together.

1995
02:07:47,494 --> 02:07:49,538
They're asking that
you be a team player...

1996
02:07:51,248 --> 02:07:52,749
and make that photograph happen for 'em.

1997
02:07:52,833 --> 02:07:56,127
That photograph. That's good.

1998
02:07:56,795 --> 02:07:59,256
That is good. Mmm.

1999
02:08:01,508 --> 02:08:03,176
Ken, even if you tie for first...

2000
02:08:04,302 --> 02:08:06,179
you'd still be the first man
ever to win...

2001
02:08:06,847 --> 02:08:09,307
Sebring, Daytona, and Le Mans
in the same year.

2002
02:08:10,100 --> 02:08:11,434
You'd have the triple crown.

2003
02:08:18,942 --> 02:08:20,193
Look, I ain't get...

2004
02:08:21,778 --> 02:08:23,405
I haven't been able to get you
to follow an Order

2005
02:08:23,488 --> 02:08:25,031
since day one.

2006
02:08:25,115 --> 02:08:26,908
Whatever you wanna do is fine with me.

2007
02:08:28,743 --> 02:08:30,161
My choice?

2008
02:08:31,663 --> 02:08:32,831
Your choice.

2009
02:08:39,671 --> 02:08:41,464
The engine's running at boiling.

2010
02:08:41,548 --> 02:08:42,841
The brakes are shot.

2011
02:08:45,969 --> 02:08:47,220
How was that?

2012
02:08:48,972 --> 02:08:49,973
Taken care of.

2013
02:08:50,390 --> 02:08:51,975
The car's yours, Ken.

2014
02:08:52,058 --> 02:08:53,351
Ken, the car's yours.

2015
02:08:54,519 --> 02:08:55,562
Ken!

2016
02:08:55,645 --> 02:08:57,147
Car's yours, Ken.

2017
02:09:30,347 --> 02:09:32,265
<i>It's the Fords
that are the cars to beat,</i>

2018
02:09:32,349 --> 02:09:33,892
<i>claiming the top three positions...</i>

2019
02:09:33,975 --> 02:09:35,226

2020
02:09:35,310 --> 02:09:36,603
<i>...led by Ken Miles in Ford number 1...</i>

2021
02:09:37,938 --> 02:09:40,398
<i>if you're not
watching this right now...</i>

2022
02:09:40,482 --> 02:09:41,524
Don't answer that.

2023
02:09:41,608 --> 02:09:42,984
Get away from it.

2024
02:09:43,068 --> 02:09:44,653
Get away from it.

2025
02:09:44,736 --> 02:09:47,280
<i>Ken Miles in Ford
number 1 is demonstrating</i>

2026
02:09:47,364 --> 02:09:50,408
<i>why he's one of the top drivers
here at Le Mans</i>

2027
02:09:50,492 --> 02:09:52,494
<i>with an outstanding display of skill.</i>

2028
02:09:53,036 --> 02:09:54,704
<i>Keep an eye on Ford number 1.</i>

2029
02:10:11,763 --> 02:10:13,264
He's gonna break his own record.

2030
02:10:13,348 --> 02:10:14,599
Shut up.

2031
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:24,401
Wait for it.

2032
02:10:26,486 --> 02:10:27,654
Wait for it.

2033
02:10:31,116 --> 02:10:31,992
Now.

2034
02:10:35,370 --> 02:10:37,747
Miles. Miles. Miles.

2035
02:10:37,831 --> 02:10:40,208

02:10:40,291 --> 02:10:42,210
Miles. Miles. Miles.

2037
02:11:16,036 --> 02:11:17,412
<i>Bellissimo.</i>

2038
02:11:17,954 --> 02:11:20,707
3:30.6. That's another record.

2039
02:11:25,128 --> 02:11:27,130
<i>Another lap record
falls to Ken Miles...</i>

2040
02:11:27,213 --> 02:11:28,715
It's a perfect lap.

2041
02:11:28,798 --> 02:11:30,592
<i>...breaking his own record
and virtually guaranteeing</i>

2042

<i>Three minutes and 30.6 seconds...</i>

Bring him in.

2048
02:11:43,229 --> 02:11:44,939
Right now! He's outta control.

2049
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:47,525
Now, you bring him in
before he wrecks that car

2050
02:11:47,609 --> 02:11:48,735
and we don't finish.

2051
02:11:51,029 --> 02:11:52,405
Bring him in, Shelby,

2052
02:11:52,489 --> 02:11:55,158
or I will get you banned
from the SCCA and the FIA.

2053
02:11:57,035 --> 02:11:58,787
Ken Miles is behind the wheel, Leo.

2054
02:11:59,329 --> 02:12:00,914

The three Fords are going

2066
02:14:28,186 --> 02:14:30,271
Ken Miles slowed down. He waited for them.

2067

<i>- Here are the Fords...</i>
- Dad.

and he's not won the race?

2083
02:15:41,718 --> 02:15:43,886
Because McLaren
started from further,

2084
02:15:43,970 --> 02:15:45,430
so he came in... see, he won.

2085
02:15:45,513 --> 02:15:46,597
Look, it's not a tie.

2086
02:15:46,681 --> 02:15:47,765
No, because McLaren...

2087
02:15:47,849 --> 02:15:49,309
Because McLaren started further back,

2088
02:15:49,392 --> 02:15:50,977
he's saying he's traveled
that little bit further,

2089
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:52,478
so he's won and not Ken.

2090
02:15:52,562 --> 02:15:54,439
That is bullshit. That's bullshit.

2091
02:15:54,522 --> 02:15:56,357

What?

2095
02:16:14,584 --> 02:16:15,918
- You son of a bitch!
- Hey, Shelby!

2096
02:16:16,002 --> 02:16:17,378
- You knew!
- No, I didn't know!

2097
02:16:17,462 --> 02:16:19,464
- That's enough! Enough!
- Get off me! Hey!

2098
02:16:20,131 --> 02:16:21,716
Bruce.

2099
02:16:21,799 --> 02:16:23,509
Nice race, mate. Congrats.

2100
02:16:45,448 --> 02:16:46,741
Shel!

2101
02:16:51,287 --> 02:16:52,747
They robbed you, Ken.

2102
02:16:52,830 --> 02:16:54,582
<i>Here is the clarification.</i>

2103
02:16:54,665 --> 02:16:57,168
<i>Though the drivers finished
the race in a heat,</i>

2104
02:16:57,251 --> 02:17:00,797
<i>McLaren has been ruled the winner
as he started from farther back.</i>

2105
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:02,632
Some bullshit technicality.

2106
02:17:02,715 --> 02:17:06,511
<i>Final results. Ford number 2,
driven by McLaren and Amon,</i>

2107
02:17:06,594 --> 02:17:08,054
<i>is the winner.</i>

2108
02:17:08,137 --> 02:17:12,058
<i>Ford number 1, driven by Miles and Hulme,
second place.</i>

2109
02:17:12,141 --> 02:17:16,270
<i>In third place, Bucknum and Hutcherson
in Ford number 5.</i>

2110
02:17:16,354 --> 02:17:17,605
I never should've asked you.

2111
02:17:23,986 --> 02:17:25,530
Selling cars, huh?

2112
02:17:28,408 --> 02:17:29,742
That's what they do.

2113
02:17:30,952 --> 02:17:33,996
Well, you promised me the drive.

2114
02:17:36,916 --> 02:17:38,042
Not the win.

2115
02:17:39,335 --> 02:17:40,753
It was a hell of a drive.

2116
02:17:41,921 --> 02:17:43,423
She's a hell of a machine.

2117
02:17:44,215 --> 02:17:45,591
Oh, she's fast.

2118
02:17:47,427 --> 02:17:48,803
Could be faster.

2119
02:17:50,763 --> 02:17:52,140
The 7 liter's sweet...

2120
02:17:52,807 --> 02:17:54,016
but, uh...

2121
02:17:55,101 --> 02:17:56,894
we still need a lighter chassis.

2122
02:17:56,978 --> 02:18:00,731
I was thinking bonded aluminium.

2123
02:18:00,815 --> 02:18:03,609
It's a ground-up rebuild,
but if it works...

2124
02:18:04,360 --> 02:18:06,529
we can lose a couple hundred pounds.

2125
02:18:06,612 --> 02:18:08,322
Well, what the hell are we doing here?

2126
02:18:10,032 --> 02:18:11,993
Let me take a shower, get a cup of tea...

2127
02:18:12,702 --> 02:18:14,245
ham and cheese cob or something.

2128
02:18:15,204 --> 02:18:16,998
We're gonna get
the bastards next year.

2129
02:18:41,022 --> 02:18:43,399
Got a bit of fuel left in the tank.

2130
02:18:44,734 --> 02:18:46,611
What do you think
of those honeycomb panels?

2131
02:18:46,694 --> 02:18:48,237
What you were looking for?

2132
02:18:48,696 --> 02:18:49,864
Don't know yet.

2133
02:19:15,598 --> 02:19:17,225
She looks pretty good.

2134
02:19:27,527 --> 02:19:31,072
<i>There's a point at 7,000 RPM...</i>

2135
02:19:32,448 --> 02:19:34,450
<i>where everything fades.</i>

2136
02:19:37,078 --> 02:19:39,330
<i>The machine becomes weightless.</i>

2137
02:19:40,456 --> 02:19:41,582
<i>Just disappears.</i>

2138
02:19:42,500 --> 02:19:43,584
Yeah!

2139
02:19:43,668 --> 02:19:44,752
<i>And all that's left</i>

2140
02:19:44,835 --> 02:19:45,920
<i>is a body...</i>

2141
02:19:46,003 --> 02:19:47,713
<i>moving through space and time.</i>

2142
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:53,344
<i>7,000 RPM.</i>

2143
02:19:54,512 --> 02:19:55,763
<i>That's where you meet it.</i>

2144
02:19:58,057 --> 02:19:59,725
<i>You feel it coming.</i>

2145
02:19:59,809 --> 02:20:01,852
<i>It creeps up on you, close in your ear.</i>

2146
02:20:10,319 --> 02:20:11,779
<i>Asks you a question.</i>

2147
02:20:13,072 --> 02:20:14,740
<i>The only question that matters.</i>

2148
02:20:20,788 --> 02:20:21,872
Get the van!

2149
02:20:23,332 --> 02:20:24,709
<i>"Who are you?"</i>

2150
02:20:58,451 --> 02:20:59,619
What do you think?

2151
02:20:59,702 --> 02:21:02,038
It's fantastic. Feels really good.

2152
02:21:02,830 --> 02:21:04,040
Nice and smooth.

2153
02:21:05,166 --> 02:21:07,168
No vibration in the box.
Feels really strong.

2154
02:21:07,251 --> 02:21:09,211
You drove it for less than an hour.

2155
02:21:09,795 --> 02:21:11,756
You can't tell shit after an hour.

2156
02:21:11,839 --> 02:21:15,217
Go for seven even, that'd be 14 all in.

2157
02:21:15,301 --> 02:21:16,427
Hey, Shel.

2158
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:29,607
Hey, Shel, that guy,
you know the one in the hat,

2159
02:21:29,690 --> 02:21:32,276
he's ready to close on those two 427s.

2160
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:34,654
His and hers. Full freight.

2161
02:21:35,655 --> 02:21:38,157
They, uh, flew in from Galveston.

2162
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:39,408
Uh-huh.

2163
02:21:40,868 --> 02:21:44,747
Uh, I need you to come outside
for maybe a minute.

2164
02:21:45,706 --> 02:21:46,874
And do what?

2165
02:21:48,709 --> 02:21:50,002
Be Carroll Shelby.

2166
02:21:51,253 --> 02:21:53,422
Tell them a story, spin a few magic words.

2167
02:21:54,590 --> 02:21:57,218
What does that mean? "Magic words"?

2168
02:21:58,511 --> 02:21:59,595
It means...

2169
02:22:00,179 --> 02:22:02,223
come outside and say hello

2170
02:22:02,306 --> 02:22:04,350
and make them feel good
about their purchase.

2171
02:22:04,433 --> 02:22:05,726
They're getting the damn cars.

2172
02:22:05,810 --> 02:22:07,478
That's what they get
for their money, Phil.

2173
02:22:07,561 --> 02:22:09,230
Now, either they want 'em or they don't.

2174
02:22:09,313 --> 02:22:11,232
- Am I some kind of a lounge act?
- No.

2175
02:22:11,315 --> 02:22:12,566
Am I here to talk people into things?

2176
02:22:24,286 --> 02:22:26,038
It's been six months, Shel.

2177
02:22:27,498 --> 02:22:29,375
Six months.

2178
02:22:33,671 --> 02:22:35,881
Sometimes they don't
get out of the car.

2179
02:23:11,375 --> 02:23:12,585
Peter!

2180
02:23:13,711 --> 02:23:16,255
Peter, come and take the garbage out.

2181
02:23:16,338 --> 02:23:17,590
Mr. Shelby.

2182
02:23:19,258 --> 02:23:20,509
Oh, hello, Pete.

2183
02:23:22,678 --> 02:23:24,138
I remember that wrench.

2184
02:23:25,431 --> 02:23:27,057
My dad threw it at you.

2185
02:23:28,517 --> 02:23:29,643
I believe he did.

2186
02:23:30,686 --> 02:23:31,854
Why?

2187
02:23:34,648 --> 02:23:35,775
Oh.

2188
02:23:36,859 --> 02:23:38,986
I think I probably said something to him.

2189
02:23:39,987 --> 02:23:41,363
Called him a few names.

2190
02:23:43,616 --> 02:23:44,909
That's right.

2191
02:23:53,793 --> 02:23:55,211
Do you wanna speak to my mum?

2192
02:23:56,128 --> 02:23:58,088
Well, I did. Uh...

2193
02:23:58,964 --> 02:24:00,925
I came to say hello,
check in on her and...

2194
02:24:05,846 --> 02:24:07,723
Then I started thinking that sometimes...

2195
02:24:10,518 --> 02:24:12,645
uh, words...

2196
02:24:13,354 --> 02:24:17,191
just... are-- are not useful.

2197
02:24:23,239 --> 02:24:25,533
Tools are useful 'cause
you can make stuff with 'em

2198
02:24:25,616 --> 02:24:27,326
and you can fix stuff with 'em.

2199
02:24:28,828 --> 02:24:30,287
Here.

2200
02:24:31,205 --> 02:24:32,331
Thanks.

2201
02:24:41,173 --> 02:24:42,633
Your daddy was, uh...

2202
02:24:46,220 --> 02:24:47,972
He was your friend.

2203
02:24:54,019 --> 02:24:55,187
Yes, he was.

2204
02:24:56,689 --> 02:24:58,232
Yes, sir.

2205
02:25:03,153 --> 02:25:05,573
And he thought you was
just finer than frog fur.

2206
02:25:10,828 --> 02:25:12,329
Peter!

2207
02:25:17,209 --> 02:25:19,169
I think I've gotta go help my mum.

2208
02:25:21,547 --> 02:25:23,883
What are you doing here then? Go on.

2209
02:25:24,925 --> 02:25:26,260
Bye.
