00:01:32,404 --> 00:01:36,404
<i>I used to think this was
the beginning of your story.</i>

2
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:45,404
<i>Memory is a strange thing.</i>

3
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:49,404
<i>It doesn't work like I thought it did.</i>

4
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:52,404
<i>We are so bound by time.</i>

5
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:55,506
<i>By its order.</i>

6
00:02:22,988 --> 00:02:25,785
It's OK. Come back to me.

7
00:02:26,262 --> 00:02:27,738
Come back to me.

8
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,596
Come back to me.

9
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,540
Stick em up!

10
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:36,732
Are you the sheriff
in this here town?

11
00:02:37,488 --> 00:02:40,488
These are my tickle guns
and I'm gonna getcha!

12
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:41,950
No.

13
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:43,935
You want me to chase you?

14
00:02:43,982 --> 00:02:45,638
You better run.

15
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,675
<i>I remember moments in the middle.</i>

16
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:12,330
I love you.

17
00:03:13,345 --> 00:03:14,876
I hate you!

18
00:03:27,003 --> 00:03:29,003
And this was the end.

19
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:38,628
Come back to me.

20
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,659
Baby, come back to me.

21
00:03:57,198 --> 00:04:00,808
But, now I'm not so sure I believe
in beginnings and endings.

22
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,431
There are days that define
your story beyond your life.

23
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:09,175
Like the day they arrived.

24
00:04:21,066 --> 00:04:22,612
Good Morning.

25
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:28,597
Where is everyone?

26
00:04:30,261 --> 00:04:32,284
Ok. Well let's get started.

27
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:35,244
Today, we're talking about Portuguese

28
00:04:35,472 --> 00:04:39,472
and why it sounds so different
from the other Romance languages.

29
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:44,149
The story of Portuguese begins
in the Kingdom of Galicia...

30
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:46,217
<i>Oh... sorry?</i>

31
00:04:46,274 --> 00:04:48,273
In the Middle Ages,

32
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,350
where language was seen
as an expression of art.

33
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:02,298
Any news you wanna share?

34
00:05:02,557 --> 00:05:06,352
Dr. Banks can you turn the TV
to a news channel?

35
00:05:23,205 --> 00:05:26,204
<i>Police have already set up
a blockade, here, around the area</i>

36
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:28,736
<i>And as you can see, we got just
about as close as we can...</i>

37
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:31,203
<i>but unfortunately,
Montana right now,</i>

38
00:05:31,232 --> 00:05:33,070
<i>is on complete lock down.</i>

39
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:35,560
<i>The object apparently</i>

40
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,928
<i>touched down 40 minutes ago
just north of I-94.</i>

41
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:43,425
<i>We're waiting to hear if this is
perhaps an experimental vessel or...</i>

42
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,169
<i>Hold on, it...</i>

43
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:50,075
<i>I'm learning that more objects
like this have landed</i>

44
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,760
<i>in as many as 8 other
locations around the world</i>

45
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,401
<i>Yes? Henry?</i>

46
00:05:56,267 --> 00:05:59,266
<i>This is from a site in Hokkaido.</i>

47
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,401
<i>This is worldwide.
It is happening right now.</i>

48
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:10,793
OK, um...

49
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:14,499
so, class is dismissed.

50
00:07:02,352 --> 00:07:04,814
<i>For now, we're simply asking
for cooperation</i>

51
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,189
<i>while authorities assess the object.</i>

52
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,820
<i>So, you're saying its not ours?</i>

53
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,154
<i>- Do you even know if its from Earth?
- We're still collecting information.</i>

54
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:13,927
<i>We're coordinating
with other countries.</i>

55
00:07:13,954 --> 00:07:17,552
<i>We're not the only ones to have
one of these in our backyard.</i>

56
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:20,979
<i>If this is some kind of
peaceful first contact,</i>

57
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:24,033
<i>why send twelve?
Why not just one?</i>

58
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:49,242
I don't know, Mom.

59
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,789
I'm watching the same
news report you are.

60
00:07:54,837 --> 00:07:56,470
Well, Mom...

61
00:07:56,985 --> 00:07:59,212
please don't bother
with that channel.

62
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,568
How many times I have to tell you
those people are idiots?

63
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,400
Yeah, well, do I sound nervous?

64
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,369
Ok, exactly. So...

65
00:08:11,688 --> 00:08:15,210
Ahm, me? You know me.
I'm about the same

66
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,628
Mom, I'm fine.

67
00:08:23,124 --> 00:08:25,535
Ok, I'll call you later. Bye.

us to know the answers.

97
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,578
I'm Colonel G.T. Weber.

98
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:07,099
We never formally met,
but two years ago,

99
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,326
you did some Farsi translation
for Army Intelligence? - Oh.

100
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:13,166
You made quick work of those
insurgent videos.

101
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:15,797
You made quick work of
those insurgents.

102
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:19,644
You are on the top...

103
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,112
of everyone's list
when it comes to translations.

104
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,025
And you have another
two years in the SSBI,

105
00:11:27,127 --> 00:11:29,571
so you still have
top secret clearance.

106
00:11:29,703 --> 00:11:32,703
That's why I'm in your office
and not in Berkeley.

107
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,118
OK?

108
00:11:43,445 --> 00:11:46,099
I have something I need you
to translate for me.

109
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
<i>Why are you here?</i>

110
00:11:59,203 --> 00:12:01,203
<i>Can you understand us?</i>

111
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,399
<i>Where did you come from?</i>

112
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:21,358
Now you heard it...

113
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:24,249
what do you make of it?

114
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:28,280
Is that...?

115
00:12:28,672 --> 00:12:30,280
Yes.

116
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:35,043
- How many?
- How many what?

117
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,399
H-how many, speaking?

118
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:43,590
Two.

119
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:47,751
Assuming, they were not
speaking at the same time.

120
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,248
Are you sure that
they have mouths?

121
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:54,288
How would you approach
translating this?

122
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:58,919
You hear any words? Phrases?

123
00:13:00,818 --> 00:13:03,398
I don't... I don't know.

124
00:13:04,154 --> 00:13:05,771
So what can you tell me?

125
00:13:05,943 --> 00:13:09,600
I can tell you that it's impossible
to translate from an audio file.

126
00:13:09,912 --> 00:13:13,231
I would need to be there
to interact with them.

127
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,348
You didn't need that
for the Farsi translation.

128
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:20,349
I didn't need it because I already
knew the language, but this is...

129
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,019
I know what you're doing.

130
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,556
- Tell me what I'm doing.
- I'm not taking you to Montana.

131
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:30,920
It's all I can do to keep it
from turning into a tourist site

132
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,429
for everybody who has
a T.S. clearance.

133
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:35,149
I'm just telling you what
it would take to do this job.

134
00:13:35,174 --> 00:13:36,853
This is not a negotiation.

135
00:13:37,531 --> 00:13:40,678
If I leave here, your chance is gone.

136
00:13:48,897 --> 00:13:50,465
Good day.

137
00:13:50,991 --> 00:13:52,598
Colonel.

138
00:13:54,507 --> 00:13:58,230
You mentioned Berkeley,
are you going to ask Danvers next?

139
00:13:58,422 --> 00:13:59,832
Maybe.

140
00:14:00,175 --> 00:14:01,833
Before you commit to him,

141
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:05,557
ask him the Sanskrit word for war,
and its translation.

142
00:14:13,398 --> 00:14:17,169
<i>An agreement on sharing scientific
discoveries looks closer tonight</i>

147
00:14:45,546 --> 00:14:47,905
- Good Morning.
- Colonel?

148
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:51,966
'Gavisti'.
He says it means an argument.

149
00:14:52,045 --> 00:14:55,185
- What do you say, it means?
- A desire for more cows.

150
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:57,310
Pack your bags.

151
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:01,529
- All right, give me 20 minutes?
- We take off in 10.

152
00:15:02,753 --> 00:15:04,982
Dr. Banks.

153
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:17,888
Sorry, I couldn't hear
what you were saying.

154
00:16:18,397 --> 00:16:21,004
"Language is the foundation
of civilization.

155
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:23,551
"It is the glue that holds
the people together.

156
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:26,537
"It is the first weapon
drawn in a conflict."

00:16:27,622 --> 00:16:29,989
Louise, this is Ian Donnelly.

158
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:32,146
Louise Banks, Ian Donnelly.

159
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,029
- That's quite a greeting!
- Yeah? Well, you wrote it.

160
00:16:35,397 --> 00:16:36,544
Yup.

161
00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:39,205
It's the kind of thing
you write as a preface.

162
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:41,390
Dazzle them with the basics.

163
00:16:41,437 --> 00:16:43,215
Well, it's great.

164
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:46,312
- Even if it's wrong.
- It's wrong?

165
00:16:46,337 --> 00:16:50,397
Well, the cornerstone of civilization
isn't language, it's science.

166
00:16:51,213 --> 00:16:54,396
Ian is a theoretical physicist
from Los Alamos.

167
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:59,216
You'll be reporting to me, but you'll be
working with him, when you're in the shell.

168
00:16:59,246 --> 00:17:01,216
That's what they're calling the UFO.

169
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:04,651
Priority one: what do they want,
where are they from?

170
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:07,243
And beyond that,
how did they get here?

171
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:10,006
Are they capable of faster
than light travel?

172
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:11,583
Are they planning on...

173
00:17:11,636 --> 00:17:14,341
a list of questions that
I want you to go over.

00:17:14,396 --> 00:17:17,022
Starting with a series of
handshake binary sequences...

175
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:18,616
How about we just talk to them,

176
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:21,488
before we start throwing
math problems at them?

177
00:17:23,132 --> 00:17:25,336
This is why you're both here.

178
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:28,828
I'll bring the coffee.

179
00:17:31,396 --> 00:17:33,396
Coffee with some aliens.

180
00:19:43,277 --> 00:19:47,394
- Alright, I want you to take these two
to Dr. Kettler. - Yes sir.

181
00:19:47,464 --> 00:19:49,097
Follow the captain to Medical...

182
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:51,257
the procedure should
take just a few minutes

183
00:19:51,283 --> 00:19:52,990
and then we'll get started.

184
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:05,980
They're gonna take
care of your bags.

185
00:20:06,009 --> 00:20:08,966
I'll get your cell phones...
cell phones.

186
00:20:10,574 --> 00:20:12,041
Follow me.

187
00:20:12,652 --> 00:20:15,299
Put these on, you gotta
wear them at all times.

188
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:29,722
Sir, they're here.

189
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:32,191
Louise Banks? Ian Donnelly?

190
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:34,370
When was the last time,
either of you have eaten?

191
00:20:34,395 --> 00:20:35,947
- Last night.
- Same.

192
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:38,171
When was the last time
you did something stressful?

193
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,661
Does now count?

194
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:42,052
Just saying.

195
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,463
Who was being
carted off in a med-evac?

196
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,369
Not everyone is able to process
experiences like this.

197
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:50,483
I'm gonna get some blood
from you

198
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:52,209
and give you an
immunization dose

199
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:54,187
that covers a battery
of bacterial threats.

200
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:57,119
Could you sign these please?
And roll up your sleeves.

201
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,180
- Either of you claustrophobic?
- No. - No.

202
00:21:00,213 --> 00:21:02,195
Currently taking
any medications?

203
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,649
Allergies?

204
00:21:04,087 --> 00:21:05,712
- Pregnant?
- No.

205
00:21:06,314 --> 00:21:08,324
The booster is a kick
to your system,

206
00:21:08,349 --> 00:21:10,240
so you may experience
some side effects:

207
00:21:10,265 --> 00:21:12,264
nausea, dizziness, headaches.

208
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,954
Or ringing in your ears,
like you have tinnitus.

209
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:39,580
<i>At exactly 112 minutes and 19 seconds</i>

210
00:21:39,744 --> 00:21:43,200
<i>gravity starts to shift
and slides us out of the room.</i>

211
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:46,268
Have you found a scientific
explanation for it?

212
00:21:46,394 --> 00:21:49,914
- Like, is it for them?
- Oh, no, we think it's for us.

213
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,665
<i>The air doesn't seem to
circulate inside the chamber, so...</i>

214
00:21:52,704 --> 00:21:55,296
<i>after two hours, you run out of oxygen.</i>

215
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,897
It doesn't take 18 hours
to pump fresh air into a room.

216
00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:00,499
Atmosphere.

217
00:22:01,894 --> 00:22:03,287
Excuse me?

218
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:05,490
If their atmosphere
is different from earth,

219
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:08,585
It would certainly take hours
to rebalance the O2 content

220
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,426
and pressure, for us, every time
they opened their door.

221
00:22:11,499 --> 00:22:14,393
So you're saying they could
suffocate us if they wanted to?

222
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:16,514
This is Agent David Halpern, CIA.

223
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:19,609
- Let me get you two to your stations.
- Yes sir.

224
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:22,369
Remember, we need answers
as soon as possible.

225
00:22:22,394 --> 00:22:24,535
What they want, where they're from,

226
00:22:24,597 --> 00:22:27,074
why they're here.
This is the priority.

227
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:28,392
Everyone.

228
00:22:28,471 --> 00:22:31,368
This is Dr. Ian Donnelly,
he'll be running this team, here.

229
00:22:31,394 --> 00:22:33,380
Have they responded to anything?

230
00:22:33,405 --> 00:22:35,825
Shapes, patterns,
numbers, Fibonacci?

231
00:22:35,973 --> 00:22:39,369
We can't tell what they're saying,
when they respond to 'hello', so...

232
00:22:40,087 --> 00:22:41,807
don't get ahead of yourself.

233
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:47,149
- What have you figured out?
- Just getting started.

234
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,629
Good Morning.

235
00:22:48,964 --> 00:22:50,605
This is Dr. Louise Banks.

236
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:53,511
- She'll be heading your team.
- Dr. Banks, it's a pleasure

237
00:22:53,557 --> 00:22:56,526
Dr. Banks is taking over the mission
from Dr. Waller.

238
00:22:57,903 --> 00:22:59,837
It's the 15 minute warning.

239
00:23:00,805 --> 00:23:03,095
D'you scuba-dive before?

240
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:07,340
What kind of radiation exposure
are we walking into?

241
00:23:07,393 --> 00:23:09,392
Nominal, these are just for safety.

242
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,949
So, is there any physical
contact with the...

243
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:15,633
Am I the only one having
trouble saying, aliens?

244
00:23:15,658 --> 00:23:19,084
There's a wall, like a glass wall.
You can't get to them.

245
00:23:20,595 --> 00:23:22,595
So, what do they look like?

246
00:23:23,447 --> 00:23:25,707
You'll see soon enough,
hurry up.

247
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:47,291
The suits are clumsy at first,

248
00:23:47,398 --> 00:23:49,275
but, you get used to'em.

249
00:23:50,783 --> 00:23:52,783
Haul up in the second vehicle.

250
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,213
We'll be there in a few minutes.

251
00:24:02,635 --> 00:24:04,822
Make sure you hold onto something.

252
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:16,048
Every 18 hours, the door
opens up, at the bottom.

253
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,538
That's when we go in.

254
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:54,812
Yeah, that just happened.

255
00:28:15,242 --> 00:28:17,391
Alright, lets move. Time is wasting.

256
00:28:18,391 --> 00:28:19,773
Ready?

257
00:28:20,171 --> 00:28:22,325
- You ready?
- Let's do it.

258
00:28:22,841 --> 00:28:26,390
Condor, I'm proceeding first
with Captain Marks, over.

259
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,178
Gravity, nominal
in the antechamber, over.

260
00:28:37,569 --> 00:28:39,655
It's all good, sir,
you can proceed.

261
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,060
Stand by.

262
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:42,965
OK, bring it up.

263
00:28:54,727 --> 00:28:56,328
You OK?

264
00:28:59,483 --> 00:29:00,780
Yeah.

265
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:03,328
Dr. Banks.

266
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:10,080
You can do this. C'mon.

267
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:11,729
I dunno, I...

268
00:29:11,903 --> 00:29:13,260
I think... aah!

269
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:22,366
Grab her.

270
00:29:38,186 --> 00:29:40,186
Dr. Donnelly, you good?

271
00:29:46,335 --> 00:29:47,663
Yeah.

272
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:52,467
Holy fuck!

273
00:29:57,835 --> 00:29:59,835
We're gonna go down there,

274
00:30:00,073 --> 00:30:01,769
and you're gonna start your job.

275
00:30:01,794 --> 00:30:03,607
- OK.
- OK.

276
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,615
Everybody, move out.

277
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:07,422
Alpha Team in position?

278
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,357
Team's in position.

279
00:30:09,721 --> 00:30:11,304
We're on the move.

280
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:02,040
Setting up equipment
with telemetry, over

281
00:31:36,005 --> 00:31:37,779
What happens now?

282
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,646
They arrive.

283
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,146
Dr. Banks.

284
00:32:52,131 --> 00:32:53,576
Dr. Banks?

285
00:32:55,389 --> 00:32:56,787
You can start.

286
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:17,388
Wait, just a minute.

287
00:33:38,113 --> 00:33:39,853
Am I fired?

288
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:42,171
You're better than the last guy.

289
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,156
That doesn't make me feel
any better.

290
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:49,498
You both have till 02:00 hours
to figure something out.

291
00:33:49,543 --> 00:33:51,543
OK, what happens, then?

292
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:53,782
You go back in.

293
00:34:27,746 --> 00:34:30,652
<i>Violence continues to spread
across the US, today</i>

294
00:34:30,728 --> 00:34:32,644
<i>in the wake of the 12 landings.</i>

295
00:34:32,676 --> 00:34:35,580
<i>The President has declared
a mandatory dusk to dawn curfew,</i>

296
00:34:35,611 --> 00:34:37,672
<i>after the crackdown
by the National Guard</i>

297
00:34:37,697 --> 00:34:41,257
<i>failed to prevent a third night
of looting across the country.</i>

298
00:34:41,299 --> 00:34:45,592
<i>In North Dakota, 144 members of
the St. Lawrence Pentecostal cult</i>

299
00:34:45,664 --> 00:34:48,840
<i>are feared dead after they
set their compound ablaze.</i>

300
00:34:48,972 --> 00:34:51,488
<i>Their website claims,
the arrival of the aliens</i>

301
00:34:51,543 --> 00:34:54,583
<i>set in motion a prophecy
that 12 sets of...</i>

302
00:35:13,386 --> 00:35:16,596
Uh, we're up in 15.
You got any new intel?

303
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:19,768
Yeah, we've been playing back
some of their sounds...

304
00:35:20,302 --> 00:35:21,907
Where does that get you?

305
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:25,361
Well, they play audio back at us,
from an unseen source.

306
00:35:25,939 --> 00:35:27,385
Audio of what?

307
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:29,740
It's bits of conversations
from the room,

308
00:35:29,786 --> 00:35:31,456
random clips of dialogue.

309
00:35:32,386 --> 00:35:35,092
Really, we...
We have nothing.

310
00:36:04,315 --> 00:36:09,503
<i>T minus 9 minutes to shell access.
T minus 9 minutes to shell access.</i>

311
00:36:10,093 --> 00:36:12,893
- What's that for?
- A visual aid.

312
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:17,848
Look, I'm never gonna be able to speak
their words, if they ARE talking.

313
00:36:17,916 --> 00:36:21,598
But they might have some sort of
written language or basis for...

314
00:36:21,645 --> 00:36:23,304
visual communication.

315
00:36:23,386 --> 00:36:25,386
OK. Let's get started.

316
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:37,237
Human.

317
00:37:04,751 --> 00:37:06,329
Human.

318
00:37:09,658 --> 00:37:11,283
I'm human.

319
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:13,892
I'm human.

320
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,674
Human.

321
00:38:16,924 --> 00:38:19,345
- Oh my God.
- Are you getting this?

322
00:38:19,385 --> 00:38:22,056
Yes sir, it's all going
back to base camp.

323
00:38:23,363 --> 00:38:26,041
Louise, its incredible!

324
00:38:41,065 --> 00:38:42,564
Human.

325
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:45,510
Human.

326
00:38:46,752 --> 00:38:48,242
Human.

327
00:38:59,398 --> 00:39:00,713
OK...

328
00:39:00,758 --> 00:39:02,584
OK, slow down Louise.

329
00:39:21,469 --> 00:39:24,125
I don't wanna take away from
your success in there,

330
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:26,971
but Dr. Banks, is this really
the right approach?

331
00:39:27,063 --> 00:39:30,284
Trying to teach them
how to speak and read?

332
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,149
That's gotta take longer.

333
00:39:32,183 --> 00:39:34,518
You're wrong. Its faster.

334
00:39:37,384 --> 00:39:38,993
Everything you do in there,

335
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,126
I have to explain to a
room full of men,

336
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:43,173
whose first and last question

337
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,437
is, 'how can this be used against us?'

338
00:39:45,618 --> 00:39:48,241
So you're gonna have to
give me more than that.

339
00:39:49,509 --> 00:39:50,970
Kangaroo.

340
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,502
What is that?

341
00:39:53,572 --> 00:39:55,148
In 1770,

342
00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:58,376
Captain James Cook's ship ran
aground off the coast of Australia

343
00:39:58,401 --> 00:40:01,974
and he led a party into the country,
and they met the aboriginal people.

344
00:40:02,005 --> 00:40:04,351
One of the sailors
pointed at the animals

345
00:40:04,384 --> 00:40:07,130
that hop around and
put their babies in their pouch,

346
00:40:07,162 --> 00:40:10,785
and he asked what they were.
And the Aborigines said "kangaroo".

347
00:40:12,816 --> 00:40:14,227
And your point is?

348
00:40:14,274 --> 00:40:16,700
It wasn't till later that they
learned that kangaroo means,

349
00:40:16,725 --> 00:40:19,061
"I don't understand". So...

350
00:40:19,138 --> 00:40:21,692
I need this so that we don't
misinterpret things in there,

351
00:40:21,717 --> 00:40:24,725
otherwise this is gonna take
ten times as long.

352
00:40:26,384 --> 00:40:28,180
I can sell that, for now.

353
00:40:29,075 --> 00:40:31,427
But I need you to submit
your vocabulary words

354
00:40:31,467 --> 00:40:33,661
before the next session.
- Fair.

355
00:40:33,966 --> 00:40:36,568
And remember what happened
to the Aborigines.

356
00:40:37,176 --> 00:40:40,240
A more advanced race,
nearly wiped them out.

357
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,180
- Its a good story.
- Thanks.

358
00:40:52,024 --> 00:40:55,024
Its not true,
but it proves my point.

359
00:41:13,232 --> 00:41:16,083
I think we were able to
reproduce some prime number

360
00:41:16,108 --> 00:41:18,826
sequences back at them.
So, that's something.

361
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,154
Well, congratulations,
you're a parrot.

362
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,431
It's a lot more than that,
you cheeky bastard. Don't you see?

363
00:41:24,486 --> 00:41:26,970
They can't seem to follow our algebra,

364
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:30,430
but, complex behaviors; that clicks.

365
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:37,191
Well, that doesn't make
any sense at all, does it?

366
00:41:41,755 --> 00:41:43,912
Problem is, not everyone
shares our policy

367
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:47,456
of being open with the aliens.
Have you met Gen. Shang?

368
00:41:48,203 --> 00:41:50,282
The call sign for him is
'big domino'.

369
00:41:50,285 --> 00:41:53,382
Whatever Shang does, at least
four other nations'll follow.

370
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,381
- Louise, we have to
gain ground today. - OK.

371
00:41:56,387 --> 00:41:59,064
- You have a vocabulary
list for me? - I do.

372
00:42:04,695 --> 00:42:07,656
You're gonna teach them
your name and Ian's?

373
00:42:08,023 --> 00:42:11,022
Yeah, so that we can learn their names,
if they have names,

374
00:42:11,047 --> 00:42:13,199
and then introduce pronouns later.

375
00:42:13,383 --> 00:42:15,450
These are all grade school words.

376
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:17,505
Eat, walk.

377
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,629
Help me understand.

378
00:42:27,266 --> 00:42:29,328
No-no-no, not the top!

379
00:42:34,507 --> 00:42:36,714
Ok, this is where
you wanna get to, right?

380
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,382
- That is the question.
- OK.

381
00:42:38,407 --> 00:42:40,374
So, first we need to make sure

382
00:42:40,412 --> 00:42:43,316
that they understand
what a question is, OK?

383
00:42:43,383 --> 00:42:48,193
The nature of a request for
information, along with the response.

384
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:51,334
Then, we need to clarify

385
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:54,451
the difference between
a specific 'you'...

386
00:42:54,522 --> 00:42:56,885
and a collective 'you'. Because...

387
00:42:56,935 --> 00:43:00,382
we don't wanna know why
Joe Alien is here,

388
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:03,077
we want to know why
they all landed.

389
00:43:03,328 --> 00:43:06,773
And purpose requires
an understanding of intent.

390
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,662
We need to find out: do they make
conscious choices?

391
00:43:09,669 --> 00:43:11,927
Or is their motivation
so instinctive

392
00:43:11,966 --> 00:43:14,904
that they don't understand
a 'why question' at all?

393
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,135
And biggest of all we need to have
enough vocabulary with them,

394
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,488
that we understand their answer.

395
00:43:23,382 --> 00:43:24,823
I get it.

396
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,091
Stick to your list.

397
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,477
Just...

398
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,099
don't add anything to it.

399
00:43:46,472 --> 00:43:51,274
<i>Gravity: 0.97.
Oxygen level: 21.4%, over.</i>

400
00:43:52,516 --> 00:43:55,872
<i>Al Moony, setting up equipment
and telemetry, over.</i>

401
00:43:55,913 --> 00:43:57,529
Let's get started.

402
00:44:07,702 --> 00:44:09,217
Louise.

403
00:44:09,748 --> 00:44:11,632
Louise, I am Louise.

404
00:44:18,785 --> 00:44:20,382
What is that?

405
00:44:22,272 --> 00:44:24,271
Is that a new symbol?
I can't tell.

406
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:27,088
I dunno, I think it's
the symbol for 'human' again.

407
00:44:27,115 --> 00:44:29,334
It just has a little curl on the end.

408
00:44:29,382 --> 00:44:32,382
Maybe they indicate a question.
I dunno.

409
00:44:33,155 --> 00:44:36,392
I dunno, Louise,
I think they're getting confused.

410
00:44:36,921 --> 00:44:40,600
Dr. Banks, perhaps we should
move on to the next word.

411
00:44:59,459 --> 00:45:01,209
Dr. Banks!

412
00:45:02,638 --> 00:45:04,713
- Hey, baby.
- What's going on?

413
00:45:04,747 --> 00:45:06,312
What are you doing?

414
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:08,356
- I'm fine.
- Are you insane?

415
00:45:08,433 --> 00:45:10,083
They need to see me.

416
00:45:10,129 --> 00:45:12,734
She's taken off her hazmat suit.
Dr. Banks!

417
00:45:14,692 --> 00:45:17,486
- Are you OK?
- You're risking contamination.

418
00:45:17,778 --> 00:45:20,336
- They need to see me.
- Dr. Banks.

419
00:45:21,851 --> 00:45:24,715
- Dr. Banks!
- She's walking toward the screen.

420
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,532
Should we abort?

421
00:45:28,602 --> 00:45:31,313
Request noted.
Stand by for flag order.

422
00:45:31,381 --> 00:45:33,381
Go back to your stations.

423
00:46:48,012 --> 00:46:50,799
Now, that's a proper introduction.

424
00:46:50,857 --> 00:46:52,450
OK.

425
00:47:02,834 --> 00:47:04,451
Louise.

426
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,810
I am Louise.

427
00:47:09,386 --> 00:47:12,150
Ian, you wanna introduce yourself?

428
00:47:14,944 --> 00:47:16,743
Ah, yes...

429
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,980
Louise.

430
00:47:25,607 --> 00:47:27,607
Screw it.

431
00:47:32,204 --> 00:47:34,146
Everybody dies, right?

432
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,534
Sir, Donnelly is taking off
his hazmat suit.

433
00:47:38,574 --> 00:47:40,508
Permission to abort?

434
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:42,609
Continue the session.

435
00:47:58,685 --> 00:48:00,263
Ian.

436
00:48:00,379 --> 00:48:02,042
Louise.

437
00:48:03,424 --> 00:48:04,931
You?

438
00:48:06,312 --> 00:48:08,158
Who are you?

439
00:48:35,295 --> 00:48:37,420
I think those are their names.

440
00:48:40,571 --> 00:48:42,382
They have names.

441
00:48:42,747 --> 00:48:45,022
So what are we gonna call them?

442
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:47,077
I dunno.

443
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:50,318
I was thinking, Abbott and Costello.

444
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:54,346
Yeah.

445
00:48:54,371 --> 00:48:56,668
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I like it.

446
00:48:58,699 --> 00:49:00,354
I like it.

447
00:49:00,425 --> 00:49:01,885
Wow!

448
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:18,036
<i>Team one, exit your vehicles
and proceed directly ahead</i>

449
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:20,102
<i>to the decontamination tent.</i>

450
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:30,144
<i>Leave your respirator on until
you reach the equipment room.</i>

451
00:49:58,418 --> 00:50:00,840
- All right?
- No.

452
00:50:06,652 --> 00:50:12,255
<i>Team two, exit your vehicles and
continue to the decontamination tent.</i>

453
00:50:13,185 --> 00:50:14,831
<i>Leave your respirators on,</i>

454
00:50:14,856 --> 00:50:18,390
<i>and do not hesitate until
you've reached the equipment room.</i>

455
00:50:21,936 --> 00:50:25,029
- How do you feel?
- Overworked.

456
00:50:25,725 --> 00:50:27,407
I guess, I don't need
to tell you,

457
00:50:27,432 --> 00:50:29,530
you're putting yourself at risk.

458
00:50:30,805 --> 00:50:33,365
There's no signs of radiation
poisoning, yet.

459
00:50:33,612 --> 00:50:36,053
We'll see how your
blood tests look.

460
00:50:36,263 --> 00:50:39,016
- For now, I'm gonna give you
another boost. - OK.

461
00:50:40,358 --> 00:50:41,805
No radiation.

462
00:50:41,863 --> 00:50:43,718
Nothing else we can
detect either.

463
00:50:43,743 --> 00:50:46,330
But I'd give them a strong
cocktail, regardless.

464
00:50:46,374 --> 00:50:49,169
It's the first time we've made
significant progress.

465
00:50:50,784 --> 00:50:53,784
Alright. We'll take the risk.

466
00:50:54,904 --> 00:50:57,669
<i>- OK, honey...
- What is going on?
- Honey...</i>

467
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,517
<i>- Is there anything you can tell me?
- I'm fine.</i>

468
00:51:00,738 --> 00:51:03,806
<i>- You don't need to worry, OK?
- How can I not worry?</i>

469
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:06,260
Just calm down.
Just calm down.

470
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:10,191
<i>Becky asked me, if the monsters
are going to kill Daddy.</i>

471
00:51:10,253 --> 00:51:12,768
Honey, its not gonna happen.

472
00:51:15,414 --> 00:51:18,172
<i>- Just stay safe.
- You don't need to worry.</i>

473
00:51:18,281 --> 00:51:20,431
<i>Please, I'm so scared.</i>

474
00:52:34,471 --> 00:52:38,147
<i>Here are some of the many things
we don't know about heptopods.</i>

475
00:52:38,218 --> 00:52:41,517
<i>Greek:
Hepta... seven. Pod... foot.</i>

476
00:52:41,729 --> 00:52:44,360
<i>Seven feet... heptopod.</i>

477
00:52:46,021 --> 00:52:47,540
<i>Who are they?</i>

478
00:52:48,423 --> 00:52:50,913
<i>Trying to answer this
in any meaningful way</i>

479
00:52:50,944 --> 00:52:52,718
<i>is hampered by the fact that,</i>

480
00:52:52,744 --> 00:52:55,498
<i>outside of being able to
see them and hear them,</i>

481
00:52:55,525 --> 00:52:58,525
<i>the heptopods leave
absolutely no footprint.</i>

482
00:53:00,104 --> 00:53:03,273
<i>The chemical composition of their
spaceship is unknown.</i>

483
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:06,953
<i>The shell emits no waste,
no gas, no radiation.</i>

484
00:53:07,532 --> 00:53:10,452
<i>Assuming that the shells
communicate with each other,</i>

485
00:53:10,477 --> 00:53:12,476
<i>they do so without detection.</i>

486
00:53:12,595 --> 00:53:17,258
<i>The air between the shells is untroubled
by sonic emission or light wave.</i>

487
00:53:19,236 --> 00:53:21,763
<i>Are they scientists or tourists?</i>

488
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,498
<i>If they're scientists,</i>

489
00:53:23,539 --> 00:53:25,911
<i>they don't seem to ask
a lot of questions.</i>

490
00:53:28,392 --> 00:53:30,679
<i>Why did they park where they did?</i>

491
00:53:30,994 --> 00:53:34,390
<i>The world's most decorated experts
can't crack that one.</i>

492
00:53:34,608 --> 00:53:37,406
<i>The most plausible theory is that
they chose places on earth</i>

493
00:53:37,431 --> 00:53:40,294
<i>with the lowest incidence of
lightning strikes.</i>

494
00:53:40,454 --> 00:53:42,350
<i>But there are exceptions.</i>

495
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:44,486
<i>The next most plausible
theory is that</i>

496
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,710
<i>Sheena Easton had a hit song in
each of these sites in 1980.</i>

497
00:53:47,736 --> 00:53:49,736
<i>So, we just don't know.</i>

498
00:53:52,193 --> 00:53:53,967
<i>How do they communicate?</i>

499
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:57,476
<i>Here, Louise is putting us all to shame.</i>

500
00:53:57,804 --> 00:54:01,287
<i>The first breakthrough was to discover
that there's no correlation</i>

501
00:54:01,329 --> 00:54:05,305
<i>between what a heptopod says,
and what a heptopod writes.</i>

502
00:54:20,775 --> 00:54:23,228
<i>Unlike all written human languages,</i>

503
00:54:23,338 --> 00:54:25,392
<i>their writing is semasiographic.</i>

504
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,022
<i>It conveys meaning,
it doesn't represent sound.</i>

505
00:54:34,005 --> 00:54:38,100
<i>Perhaps they view our form of writing
as a wasted opportunity,</i>

506
00:54:38,501 --> 00:54:41,397
<i>Passing up a second
communications channel.</i>

507
00:54:46,167 --> 00:54:48,219
<i>We have our friends in Pakistan to thank</i>

508
00:54:48,244 --> 00:54:50,813
<i>for their study of how
heptopods write.</i>

509
00:54:52,189 --> 00:54:53,915
<i>Because unlike speech,</i>

510
00:54:53,970 --> 00:54:55,970
<i>a logogram is free of time.</i>

511
00:54:58,978 --> 00:55:00,977
<i>Like their ship or their bodies.</i>

512
00:55:01,611 --> 00:55:05,375
<i>Their written language has no
forward or backward direction.</i>

513
00:55:05,454 --> 00:55:08,343
<i>Linguists call this nonlinear orthography.</i>

514
00:55:08,782 --> 00:55:12,325
<i>Which raises the question:
is this how they think?</i>

515
00:55:14,234 --> 00:55:17,134
<i>Imagine you wanted to write
a sentence using 2 hands,</i>

516
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:19,013
<i>starting from either side.</i>

517
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,514
<i>You'd have to know each word
you wanted to use,</i>

518
00:55:22,555 --> 00:55:25,555
<i>as well as how much space
they would occupy.</i>

519
00:55:27,308 --> 00:55:29,396
<i>A heptopod can write
a complex sentence</i>

520
00:55:29,437 --> 00:55:31,436
<i>in two seconds, effortlessly.</i>

521
00:55:31,624 --> 00:55:34,624
<i>It's taken us a month
to make the simplest reply.</i>

522
00:55:35,173 --> 00:55:37,896
<i>Next: expanding vocabulary.</i>

523
00:55:38,032 --> 00:55:41,841
<i>Louise thinks it could easily take
another month to be ready for that.</i>

524
00:55:58,844 --> 00:56:00,483
Hey.

525
00:56:01,571 --> 00:56:04,460
- Hey.
- Weber's looking for you.

526
00:56:05,366 --> 00:56:08,231
Yeah, well why do you think
I'm hiding out here?

527
00:56:09,606 --> 00:56:11,153
Come on up.

528
00:56:17,336 --> 00:56:19,084
Nice out here, huh?

529
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,571
Yeah, it's a nice view.

530
00:56:22,313 --> 00:56:24,313
Away from the noise.

531
00:56:27,266 --> 00:56:29,876
You know,
I was just thinking about you.

532
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:35,876
You approach language like a
mathematician. You know that, right?

533
00:56:37,985 --> 00:56:40,229
I won't take that as a compliment.

534
00:56:40,423 --> 00:56:42,141
Yeah, well it is.

535
00:56:43,977 --> 00:56:47,895
And... I watch you steer us around
these communication traps

536
00:56:47,953 --> 00:56:50,019
that I didn't even know existed.

537
00:56:50,399 --> 00:56:51,817
So, why...

538
00:56:53,916 --> 00:56:55,783
I guess that's why I'm single.

539
00:56:55,808 --> 00:57:00,752
Trust me, you can understand
communication and still end up single.

540
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:07,154
Oh.

541
00:57:10,015 --> 00:57:12,842
I feel like everything
that happens in there...

542
00:57:13,655 --> 00:57:15,875
comes down to the two of us.

543
00:57:17,202 --> 00:57:21,036
Yeah, it's a good thing,
though, right? You and I?

544
00:57:24,348 --> 00:57:27,541
Have you seen the jokers
that we're working with?

545
00:57:28,249 --> 00:57:30,317
Thank God, I got you.

546

554
00:58:06,038 --> 00:58:10,037

healthcare and bankrupted our military.</i>

555

566
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:02,875
What's this word?

567
00:59:18,527 --> 00:59:19,934
Planet.

568
00:59:20,094 --> 00:59:22,395
Green... planet.

569
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:28,842
That's lie, um,
the Earth is a planet.

570
00:59:29,467 --> 00:59:32,319
Want to see my project
for Miss. Garrett's class?

571
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,209
Yeah, little nose.

572
00:59:37,467 --> 00:59:39,795
We had to make up our own TV show.

573
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,124
If we had one.

574
00:59:42,811 --> 00:59:45,873
- And who are those two people?
- That's you and Dad.

575
00:59:45,998 --> 00:59:49,097
The show is called:
Mommy and Daddy Talk to Animals.

576
00:59:49,177 --> 00:59:50,606
Ah.

577
00:59:51,115 --> 00:59:52,956
Oh, its lovely.

578
00:59:57,129 --> 00:59:58,652
Ok.

579
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:01,262
Um...

580
01:00:02,341 --> 01:00:06,341
- You know, it's OK to be sad that
your dad and I... - You know. I'm not.

581
01:00:08,366 --> 01:00:10,365
'Cause we both love you very much.

582
01:00:10,413 --> 01:00:13,105
I know.
It's just a cartoon: not real.

583
01:00:13,339 --> 01:00:14,874
Louise?

584
01:00:19,097 --> 01:00:20,675
You alright?

585
01:00:21,488 --> 01:00:22,824
Yeah.

586
01:00:23,177 --> 01:00:25,091
Yeah, I-I'm fine.

587
01:00:26,887 --> 01:00:30,404
I'm not sure it's something,
I can... I can explain.

588
01:00:30,661 --> 01:00:33,138
When was your last checkup
with Dr. Kettler?

589
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:35,521
I'm OK.

590
01:00:35,725 --> 01:00:37,474
Gonna get some air.

591
01:00:37,792 --> 01:00:39,786
- I'm OK.
- Alright.

592
01:01:40,965 --> 01:01:42,518
How you feelin'?

593
01:01:46,873 --> 01:01:48,802
I need some sleep, but...

594
01:01:49,529 --> 01:01:51,036
I'm fine.

595
01:01:51,482 --> 01:01:52,872
Yeah?

596
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:57,770
Y'know, I was doing some reading
about this idea that...

597
01:01:58,222 --> 01:02:00,775
if you immerse yourself into
a foreign language,

598
01:02:00,806 --> 01:02:03,409
that you can actually
rewire your brain.

599
01:02:03,513 --> 01:02:05,921
Yeah, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis.

600
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:08,873
It is a theory that...

601
01:02:09,263 --> 01:02:11,262
It is the theory, that,

602
01:02:11,349 --> 01:02:14,801
the language you speak
determines how you think and...

603
01:02:14,974 --> 01:02:17,974
Yeah, it affects how you
see everything. It was...

604
01:02:19,144 --> 01:02:22,783
I'm curious. Are you dreaming
in their language?

605
01:02:32,951 --> 01:02:35,951
I may have had a few
dreams, but I don't...

606
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:40,441
I don't think that that makes me
unfit to do this job.

607
01:03:00,552 --> 01:03:02,912
- Did you sleep?
- A little.

608
01:03:04,029 --> 01:03:05,977
Do you know Mandarin?

609
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:22,027
The voice you're about to hear
belongs to China's military chief.

610
01:03:23,996 --> 01:03:25,540
General Shang.

611
01:03:26,368 --> 01:03:28,022
Put it on.

612
01:03:30,637 --> 01:03:34,637
We got a satellite feed, here
who he's talking to, if you want to look.

613
01:03:35,341 --> 01:03:36,872
Wait, go back.

614
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:39,776
Stop.

615
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:45,416
He's saying that each of the 12
is offering advanced technology.

616
01:03:47,974 --> 01:03:50,433
Back again... and play.

617
01:03:53,777 --> 01:03:57,776
Our science team is attempting
to decode the sets...

618
01:03:58,449 --> 01:04:00,939
"sets"?
I don't know what that means.

619
01:04:01,236 --> 01:04:05,216
Something about advantage,
suits, honor and flowers.

620
01:04:05,719 --> 01:04:07,161
I don't...

621
01:04:08,324 --> 01:04:09,943
I dunno, that's all.

622
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:12,362
I don't know what
it means either.

623
01:04:12,434 --> 01:04:15,010
An hour ago, China mobilized forces...

624
01:04:15,237 --> 01:04:17,284
and now Russia is following suit.

625
01:04:17,872 --> 01:04:19,948
Shang is about to start something.

626
01:04:20,034 --> 01:04:22,206
Following same suits...

627
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:26,784
suits, honor, flowers...

628
01:04:26,934 --> 01:04:29,503
Colonel, those are all
tile sets in Mahjong.

629
01:04:31,489 --> 01:04:33,158
God, are they...?

630
01:04:33,473 --> 01:04:36,768
Are they using a game to converse
with their heptopods?

631
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:39,872
Maybe, why?

632
01:04:39,933 --> 01:04:43,503
Well, let's say that I taught them
chess instead of English.

633
01:04:43,831 --> 01:04:48,103
Every conversation would be a game,
every idea expressed through opposition.

634
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,650
Victory, defeat: you see the problem?

635
01:04:51,644 --> 01:04:54,260
If all I ever gave you was a hammer...

636
01:04:54,707 --> 01:04:56,627
Everything's a nail.

637
01:04:58,138 --> 01:05:00,138
We need to ask the big question.

638
01:05:01,504 --> 01:05:03,167
Ready or not.

639
01:05:49,507 --> 01:05:51,195
Heptopod's purpose.

640
01:06:02,183 --> 01:06:05,793
Tell me your purpose on Earth.
What is your purpose?

641
01:06:12,377 --> 01:06:14,502
Do we only have Costello?

642
01:06:18,969 --> 01:06:20,884
Ok. There you are.

643
01:06:43,316 --> 01:06:45,316
What does it say?

644
01:06:53,165 --> 01:06:54,871
Offer weapon.

645
01:06:59,412 --> 01:07:03,592
- Well, you saw what they wrote!
- Using a word they don't fully understand.

646
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:05,279
Enough!

647
01:07:05,325 --> 01:07:06,919
Louise.

648
01:07:07,073 --> 01:07:09,072
We don't know if they understand

649
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,159
the difference between a weapon and a tool.

650
01:07:12,307 --> 01:07:16,040
Our language like our culture is messy
and sometimes one can be both.

651
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:18,513
And it's quite possible
that they're asking us

652
01:07:18,544 --> 01:07:21,477
to offer them something,
put the other way around.

653
01:07:21,577 --> 01:07:23,208
Like the first part of a trade.

654
01:07:23,252 --> 01:07:26,419
So how do we clarify their intentions
beyond those two words?

655
01:07:26,495 --> 01:07:29,805
I go back in. Right away we go
back in and we clear this up.

656
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:33,744
- It's more complicated than that.
- How is it more complicated than that?

657
01:07:34,331 --> 01:07:37,751
Colonel, the Secretary of Defense
is on the line for you.

658
01:07:44,744 --> 01:07:48,221
We need to sit on this information
till we know what it means.

659
01:07:48,252 --> 01:07:51,080
So we aren't sharing it with our enemies.
We have to consider the idea

660
01:07:51,105 --> 01:07:53,744
that our visitors are prodding us
to fight among ourselves,

661
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:55,768
until only one faction prevails.

662
01:07:55,846 --> 01:07:58,398
- There is no evidence of that.
- Sure there is.

663
01:07:58,518 --> 01:08:00,517
Just grab a history book.

664
01:08:00,697 --> 01:08:03,697
The British with India,
the Germans with Rwanda.

665
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:07,845
They even got a name for it, in Hungary.
(Salami tactics)

666
01:08:11,561 --> 01:08:12,993
Yeah...

667
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,930
We're a world with no single leader.

668
01:08:16,185 --> 01:08:18,606
It's impossible to deal with
just one of us.

669
01:08:18,645 --> 01:08:20,777
And with the word weapon, now...

670
01:08:21,129 --> 01:08:22,613
Halpern...

671
01:08:23,527 --> 01:08:25,106
Yes General.

672
01:08:42,071 --> 01:08:44,494
<i>No confirmation, yet. Stand by.</i>

673
01:08:45,537 --> 01:08:46,881
<i>Anything...</i>

674
01:08:48,189 --> 01:08:49,896
What did they say?

675
01:08:50,499 --> 01:08:53,328
China and Russia are off the grid.
They aren't speaking to anyone.

676
01:08:53,353 --> 01:08:56,857
Whatever they learned in their
last session has them spooked.

677
01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:02,140
Yes sir...
We have orders to do the same.

678
01:09:02,252 --> 01:09:05,411
- Wait these are our allies!
- Put us on radio silence!

679
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:06,782
Do it.

680
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:09,079
We received a message
from the hept...

681
01:09:09,636 --> 01:09:12,653
Dammit! We need to be
talking to each other!

682
01:09:12,678 --> 01:09:16,060
You wanna talk to them?
Find out what this means.

683
01:09:20,751 --> 01:09:23,608
<i>Base-camp talk is now offline.
All interpreters...</i>

684
01:09:23,633 --> 01:09:25,709
<i>Don't call Information,
they're offline.</i>

685
01:09:25,742 --> 01:09:28,148
<i>stand down, report to unit coordinators.</i>

686
01:09:30,717 --> 01:09:33,019
We've never re-entered
a session, before.

687
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:35,562
Louise, trust me OK?
We got time.

688
01:09:35,587 --> 01:09:37,587
Just gotta step on it, alright?

689
01:09:38,336 --> 01:09:39,974
<i>"Use weapon",</i>

690
01:09:40,024 --> 01:09:42,452
<i>This is the alien message,

691
01:09:42,477 --> 01:09:45,085
<i>the Chinese government to
withdraw their scientists</i>

692
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:47,171
<i>from the international
mission today.</i>

693
01:09:47,665 --> 01:09:50,117
<i>In a statement, General Shang said:</i>

694
01:09:50,172 --> 01:09:53,475
<i>"China no longer trusts the aliens
who want to divide us.</i>

695
01:09:53,643 --> 01:09:55,686
<i>"Humanity must be protected."</i>

696
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:58,443
<i>China has asked for immediate
talks at the UN.</i>

<i>Alpha 1-9er, this is Condor, over.</i>

698
01:10:09,157 --> 01:10:12,960
<i>Alpha 1-9er, this is Condor.
Come in, over.</i>

699
01:10:18,275 --> 01:10:21,458
<i>Captain Marks, Condor,
not receiving transmission.</i>

700
01:10:21,492 --> 01:10:23,492
<i>Perhaps they can hear mine.</i>

701
01:10:24,477 --> 01:10:28,479
<i>Captain Marks, all escorters are
ordered to cease all activity.</i>

702
01:10:58,602 --> 01:11:00,818
No-no-no...
Dr. Banks you can't go in there.

703
01:11:00,843 --> 01:11:03,466
- We just need to ask one question.
- Dr. Banks!

704
01:11:04,118 --> 01:11:07,215
The session is finished.
You can't go back in, it's dangerous.

705
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:10,999
Look, we just need 5 minutes.
Don't sweat it. - Marks, let'em go.

706
01:11:13,868 --> 01:11:15,522
Hey, Abbott.

707
01:11:20,742 --> 01:11:23,742
So, what are we calling this?
Session 37?

708
01:11:23,813 --> 01:11:25,881
Ah, no: 36, Part 2.

709
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:27,024
Ok.

710
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:28,779
Ok.

711
01:11:34,249 --> 01:11:35,466
What do you know?

712
01:11:35,507 --> 01:11:37,505
We've been attempting
to hail Captain Marks.

713
01:11:37,571 --> 01:11:40,630
The escort units are not
responding, sir. - Why not?

714
01:11:41,868 --> 01:11:43,553
Send security.

715
01:11:46,309 --> 01:11:49,544
Offer a weapon... question mark.

716
01:11:54,734 --> 01:11:56,772
Are you offering us something?

717
01:12:05,977 --> 01:12:08,921
Technology, apparatus, method.

718
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:11,257
Yeah, see, this is
a different word.

719
01:12:11,352 --> 01:12:14,075
This... this segment,
it's a lot busier.

720
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:22,561
Give... technology...

721
01:12:24,438 --> 01:12:25,896
now.

722
01:12:34,335 --> 01:12:35,840
What's he doing?

723
01:12:41,515 --> 01:12:43,627
<i>Captain, on your 10.</i>

724
01:12:52,774 --> 01:12:54,499
<i>Security detail inbound, sir.</i>

725
01:12:54,524 --> 01:12:57,678
<i>T minus 4 minutes remaining.
We need to see this through.</i>

726
01:12:57,844 --> 01:12:59,560
<i>OK, this is it, lock and load.</i>

727
01:12:59,587 --> 01:13:02,027
<i>- We just need to hold them off
until it's done. - Copy, that.</i>

01:13:02,055 --> 01:13:04,002

01:13:04,029 --> 01:13:05,404
<i>Load up and get to cover.</i>

730
01:13:05,482 --> 01:13:07,868
<i>Stay fresh and we can
avoid casualties.</i>

731
01:13:34,468 --> 01:13:36,956
Abbott wants me to write
on the barrier.

732
01:13:41,892 --> 01:13:43,706
Can you, even, do that?

733
01:13:44,975 --> 01:13:46,975
I don't know.

734
01:14:02,578 --> 01:14:04,685
I can't do it with both hands.

735
01:15:16,343 --> 01:15:17,781
Louise.

736
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:34,866
What is that?

737
01:16:19,677 --> 01:16:22,185
Hey!
Hey, hey, take it easy.

738
01:16:22,248 --> 01:16:24,904
You suffered a concussion.
Just lay back.

739
01:16:28,099 --> 01:16:29,722
How do you feel?

740
01:16:38,295 --> 01:16:41,215
- How is Ian?
- Same as you. He's OK.

741
01:16:43,248 --> 01:16:44,754
Who...

742
01:16:45,045 --> 01:16:46,769
Who did this?

743
01:16:46,824 --> 01:16:49,863
Some soldiers.
Been watching too much TV.

744
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:56,341
- What is that?
- Take it easy, take it easy.

745
01:16:56,944 --> 01:17:00,545
This place is no longer secure.
We're standing by to evacuate.

746
01:17:00,663 --> 01:17:02,663
Where is Ian?

747
01:17:03,138 --> 01:17:05,925
Weber came and got him
maybe 10 minutes ago.

748
01:17:06,182 --> 01:17:09,034
He wouldn't leave until
he knew you were OK.

749
01:17:12,145 --> 01:17:16,866
The whole tent is on the clock to figure
out whatever it is you were given up there.

750
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:23,865
This is all of it.

751
01:17:24,404 --> 01:17:27,221
The feed wasn't interrupted
by the explosion?

752
01:17:27,496 --> 01:17:29,189
That's right.

753
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:34,322
- You see something?
- I don't know, yet.

754
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:37,456
I'm gonna need my team to get
together with Louise's team.

755
01:17:37,481 --> 01:17:40,302
- I need everyone working on this.
- We cannot leave.

756
01:17:40,327 --> 01:17:42,488
- Glad to see you're awake.
- We need to go back in there.

757
01:17:42,512 --> 01:17:44,373
We need to explain to them that
this wasn't our fault.

758
01:17:44,397 --> 01:17:46,592
- We can't go back inside.
- We have to!

759
01:17:46,865 --> 01:17:48,864
What happened in there was
an attack.

760
01:17:48,889 --> 01:17:51,830
We can hope for the best,
but I have to prepare for retaliation.

761
01:17:51,865 --> 01:17:54,013
- We may have to evacuate.
- That's the wrong move.

762
01:17:54,043 --> 01:17:56,841
As long as they stay,
we have to stay.

763
01:18:31,013 --> 01:18:33,013
Well, they're not leaving.

764
01:18:34,669 --> 01:18:36,669
Why does it feel worse?

765
01:18:41,534 --> 01:18:43,397
China is on the offensive.

766
01:18:43,422 --> 01:18:46,881
They're positioning their military to blow
the alien vessel right out of the sky.

767
01:18:46,918 --> 01:18:50,621
And if this happens, we can't sit
around waiting for retaliation. So...

768
01:18:50,715 --> 01:18:52,340
get prepared.

769
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:55,126
The Air Force and Infantry
are standing by.

770
01:18:55,222 --> 01:18:56,837
Yes, sir.

efforts of the United Nations,</i>

01:19:54,237 --> 01:19:56,157
It can't be random.

787
01:20:11,759 --> 01:20:13,759
Its going to take us years.

788
01:20:18,916 --> 01:20:20,916
What's this term here?

789
01:20:24,682 --> 01:20:26,227
Mum.

790
01:20:28,737 --> 01:20:30,532
- Mum.
- Hm?

791
01:20:30,823 --> 01:20:33,293
- Sweetie?
- What's this term...

792
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:35,950
for that thing,
like a technical term...

793
01:20:36,354 --> 01:20:39,532
Where we make a deal and we
both get something out of it?

794
01:20:39,619 --> 01:20:42,619
- A compromise?
- No...

795
01:20:43,229 --> 01:20:45,766
- Like it's a competition,
- M-hm...

796
01:20:45,854 --> 01:20:48,102
But both sides end up happy.

797
01:20:49,745 --> 01:20:51,744
Like a win-win?

798
01:20:51,784 --> 01:20:53,656
More sciencey than that.

799
01:20:53,909 --> 01:20:56,554
If you want science,
call your father.

800
01:21:10,807 --> 01:21:12,505
Thank you.

801
01:21:22,859 --> 01:21:24,422
Sorry.

802
01:21:24,752 --> 01:21:26,274
It's OK.

803
01:21:32,103 --> 01:21:33,770
What time is it?

804
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:38,040
It's time to open that bottle,
you've been hiding.

805
01:21:41,636 --> 01:21:43,963
You cracked something,
didn't you?

806
01:21:44,235 --> 01:21:46,027
Yeah. C'mere.

807
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:49,111
Take a look at this section.

808
01:21:49,157 --> 01:21:51,205
It seems to be talking
about time.

809
01:21:51,267 --> 01:21:54,266
Their symbol for time
is everywhere.

810
01:21:54,768 --> 01:21:56,425
So what is this?

811
01:21:57,422 --> 01:22:00,202
A formula for faster than light travel?

812
01:22:00,603 --> 01:22:02,295
Who can tell?

813
01:22:02,899 --> 01:22:05,655
There are too many gaps.
Nothing's complete.

814
01:22:05,884 --> 01:22:07,592
Then it dawned on me.

815
01:22:10,516 --> 01:22:12,038
Right here.

816
01:22:12,921 --> 01:22:15,640
Stop focusing on the ones.
Look at the zeroes.

817
01:22:15,963 --> 01:22:19,680
How much of this is data?
How much of it is negative space?

818
01:22:20,705 --> 01:22:22,570
So, I measured it.

819
01:22:24,173 --> 01:22:26,414
.0833 recurring.

820
01:22:32,493 --> 01:22:34,886
Perhaps you'd like that
as a fraction.

821
01:22:37,994 --> 01:22:39,776
1 of 12.

822
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,741
What they're saying right here
is that

823
01:22:44,787 --> 01:22:47,686
this is one of twelve.
We are part of a larger whole.

824
01:22:47,725 --> 01:22:49,832
Or we're 1 of 12
contestants for the prize.

825
01:22:49,889 --> 01:22:52,734
- Why do I have to talk to him?
- We're all working together here.

826
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:54,391
We need to talk to
the other sites.

827
01:22:54,416 --> 01:22:57,325
We need to help them with what
they got from the other heptopods.

828
01:22:57,350 --> 01:22:59,442
In case you don't remember,
we're blacked out.

829
01:22:59,485 --> 01:23:02,223
China just threatened to destroy
their shell. We're on our own.

830
01:23:02,255 --> 01:23:04,254
But it says that all the
pieces fit together.

831
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:06,783
And I'm telling you
that no one else cares.

832
01:23:07,103 --> 01:23:10,220
Two hours ago we pulled this audio off
a secure channel in Russia.

833
01:23:10,267 --> 01:23:13,541
Someone from the science team
there was broadcasting live.

834
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,943
In their final session,
the aliens said,

835
01:23:18,033 --> 01:23:21,209
"There is no time. Many become one."

836
01:23:22,275 --> 01:23:24,444
I feel we have all been
given weapons.

837
01:23:24,571 --> 01:23:26,571
If anyone is receiving this...

838
01:23:27,243 --> 01:23:28,679
Please...

839
01:23:34,111 --> 01:23:35,806
Well, I mean...

840
01:23:36,743 --> 01:23:39,116
There are a lot of ways you can
interpret what he said.

841
01:23:39,149 --> 01:23:41,358
I don't need an interpreter to
know what this means.

842
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:45,091
Russia just executed one of their
own experts to keep their secret.

843
01:23:45,135 --> 01:23:47,629
"Many become one"
could just be their way of saying,

844
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:49,300
"some assembly required".

845
01:23:49,329 --> 01:23:52,597
Why hand it out to us in pieces?
Why not just give it all over?

846
01:23:52,622 --> 01:23:55,793
What better way to force us
to work together for once?

847
01:23:56,104 --> 01:23:57,537
Even if I did believe you,

848
01:23:57,562 --> 01:24:02,185
how in the world are you gonna get anybody
else to play along, and give up their data?

849
01:24:02,571 --> 01:24:04,310
We offer ours in return.

850
01:24:05,334 --> 01:24:06,638
Yeah.

851
01:24:06,711 --> 01:24:09,529
- What, trade?
- Its a non zero-sum game.

852
01:24:12,158 --> 01:24:14,181
Non zero-sum game.

853
01:24:15,648 --> 01:24:18,532
That's it, yeah. Thanks.

854
01:24:26,063 --> 01:24:29,131
9 of the landing sites have gone
total comms blackout.

855
01:24:29,444 --> 01:24:31,656
The only way to reach them
is to physically drive there

856
01:24:31,681 --> 01:24:34,738
and yell at the border guards which we're
doing, but it won't be fast enough.

857
01:24:34,763 --> 01:24:37,222
There's gotta be a way to
get the message through...

858
01:24:37,297 --> 01:24:40,296
To our allies, maybe. But at this stage,
it's little too late.

859
01:24:40,321 --> 01:24:43,256
What we need, is to get
all the other nations online,

860
01:24:43,319 --> 01:24:45,277
before one starts global war.

861
01:24:45,324 --> 01:24:47,476
And there's no way
for us to reach them

862
01:24:47,516 --> 01:24:49,988
Wait, hold on a second. There is.

863
01:24:51,172 --> 01:24:52,741
It's right above us.

864
01:24:53,641 --> 01:24:55,733
That's problematic for us
right now.

865
01:24:55,820 --> 01:24:58,613
The Pentagon's convinced
our shell will retaliate.

866
01:24:58,647 --> 01:25:01,949
My guess is, they'll order us
to evacuate within the hour.

867
01:25:02,261 --> 01:25:05,620
Look they're not our enemy. They've
made no act of aggression towards us.

868
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,679
Maybe this is their way
of being aggressive.

869
01:25:07,711 --> 01:25:09,457
It's not the question.

870
01:25:09,645 --> 01:25:11,457
Well, what is the question?

871
01:25:11,672 --> 01:25:15,397
How do we get you back in that room
when it's half a mile straight up?

872
01:25:15,422 --> 01:25:17,421
I think our work here is done.

873
01:25:17,962 --> 01:25:20,444
It's in the hands of
our superiors now.

874
01:25:40,656 --> 01:25:42,656
What the hell is she doing?

875
01:28:59,483 --> 01:29:01,155
Costello.

876
01:29:03,693 --> 01:29:05,420
Where's Abbott?

877
01:29:15,310 --> 01:29:18,365
[Abbot is death process]

878
01:29:34,959 --> 01:29:36,748
I'm sorry.

879
01:29:38,888 --> 01:29:40,560
We're sorry.

880
01:29:44,574 --> 01:29:46,457
I need you to...

881
01:29:47,521 --> 01:29:50,825
I need you to send a message
to the other sites.

882
01:29:57,674 --> 01:30:00,502
[Louise has weapon]

883
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,300
[Use weapon]

884
01:30:12,152 --> 01:30:14,144
I don't understand.

885
01:30:14,372 --> 01:30:17,199
What... is your purpose here?

886
01:30:24,895 --> 01:30:29,372
[We help humanity]

887
01:30:33,372 --> 01:30:37,863
[In 3000 years...]

888
01:30:39,003 --> 01:30:42,439
[We need humanity help]

889
01:30:44,466 --> 01:30:46,466
How can you know the future?

890
01:31:03,474 --> 01:31:05,027
I don't...

891
01:31:06,591 --> 01:31:10,096
I don't understand. Who is this child?

892
01:31:15,873 --> 01:31:19,022
The show is called,
Mommy and Daddy Talk to Animals.

893
01:31:31,597 --> 01:31:35,152
[Louise sees future]

894
01:31:45,601 --> 01:31:49,357
[Weapon opens time]

895
01:31:53,536 --> 01:31:54,776
Wait.

896
01:31:54,862 --> 01:31:56,487
No! Wait!

897
01:32:45,987 --> 01:32:47,463
- Dr. Banks!
- Louise!

898
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:49,284
Are you alright?

899
01:32:52,348 --> 01:32:54,347
- You alright?
- Yeah.

900
01:32:54,958 --> 01:32:57,746
- What happened?
- Tried to figure it out, but it's too big

901
01:32:57,787 --> 01:33:00,551
Doesn't matter now.
We have orders to evacuate.

902
01:33:00,583 --> 01:33:03,958
- Why?
- Russia and Sudan are following China.

903
01:33:06,879 --> 01:33:08,421
I don't understand why...?

904
01:33:08,446 --> 01:33:10,254
Help me, Mama.

905
01:33:10,831 --> 01:33:13,269
Louise... Whoa!

906
01:33:13,419 --> 01:33:14,918
Mom!

907
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:18,667
Mama!

908
01:33:20,958 --> 01:33:22,683
Sorry, honey.

909
01:33:25,917 --> 01:33:28,253
What day is it, today,
you know baby?

910
01:33:28,323 --> 01:33:29,980
Sunday.

911
01:33:35,407 --> 01:33:37,957
Are you gonna leave me like daddy did?

912
01:33:38,581 --> 01:33:41,581
Oh, Hannah, honey,
your daddy didn't leave you.

913
01:33:42,293 --> 01:33:44,638
You're gonna see him, this weekend.

914
01:33:45,644 --> 01:33:48,644
He doesn't look at me
the same way, anymore.

915
01:33:56,721 --> 01:33:58,408
Its my fault.

916
01:34:00,706 --> 01:34:04,056
I told him something that
he wasn't ready to hear.

917
01:34:05,777 --> 01:34:07,306
What?

918
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:10,543
Well...

919
01:34:11,168 --> 01:34:13,105
Believe it or not...

920
01:34:13,636 --> 01:34:16,636
I know something that's
going to happen.

921
01:34:18,402 --> 01:34:21,402
I can't explain how I know,
I just do.

922
01:34:22,574 --> 01:34:25,574
And when I told your dad,
he got really mad.

923
01:34:27,596 --> 01:34:30,283
And he said I made the wrong choice.

924
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:33,938
What?

925
01:34:33,986 --> 01:34:35,945
What's going to happen?

926
01:34:38,425 --> 01:34:40,343
It has to do with a...

927
01:34:40,406 --> 01:34:42,957
a really rare disease.

928
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:47,480
And it's unstoppable.

929
01:34:49,401 --> 01:34:51,274
Kinda like you are.

930
01:34:52,009 --> 01:34:53,743
Your swimming...

931
01:34:54,487 --> 01:34:58,487
and your poetry and all the other amazing
things that you share with the world.

932
01:34:59,229 --> 01:35:01,081
I'm unstoppable?

933
01:35:01,778 --> 01:35:03,276
Yeah.

934
01:35:20,055 --> 01:35:21,477
I got you.

935
01:35:21,518 --> 01:35:22,769
Oh!

936
01:35:23,168 --> 01:35:24,519
Louise.

937
01:35:25,159 --> 01:35:26,521
Louise.

938
01:35:28,113 --> 01:35:30,433
I just realized why
my husband left me.

939
01:35:30,957 --> 01:35:33,894
- My husband left me.
- Ah, you were married?

940
01:35:35,289 --> 01:35:36,920
Let's get outta here.

941
01:36:11,245 --> 01:36:13,298
- Mama.
- Yeah?

942
01:36:14,136 --> 01:36:16,136
Why my name is Hannah?

943
01:36:21,377 --> 01:36:24,231
Well, your name is very special,

944
01:36:24,291 --> 01:36:26,290
because it is a palindrome.

945
01:36:26,494 --> 01:36:30,016
It reads the same forward
and backward.

946
01:36:32,127 --> 01:36:35,558
- Get those lights.
- That goes here, in the back.

947
01:36:49,331 --> 01:36:53,848
<i>Civilian contractors must have
their authorization back and...</i>

948
01:37:00,622 --> 01:37:03,652
<i>Evacuation underway.
All personnel evacuate.</i>

949
01:37:06,761 --> 01:37:08,329
Hey!

950
01:37:08,884 --> 01:37:10,595
We're done, here.

951
01:37:10,799 --> 01:37:12,799
Let's take this with us.

952
01:37:36,891 --> 01:37:38,467
I can read it.

953
01:37:42,506 --> 01:37:44,425
- I know what it is.
- What?

954
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:46,715
It's not a weapon, it's a gift.

955
01:37:47,423 --> 01:37:50,359
The weapon is their language.
They gave it all to us.

956
01:37:50,421 --> 01:37:54,218
- Do you understand what that means?
- So we can learn heptopod? If we survive.

957
01:37:54,243 --> 01:37:57,186
If you learn it...
When you, really, learn it,

958
01:37:57,243 --> 01:38:00,163
you begin to perceive time
the way that they do.

959
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:02,269
So you can see what's to come.

960
01:38:02,556 --> 01:38:06,252
But, time: it isn't the same for them.
It's non-linear.

961
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:09,957
Look, we did our best
but it wasn't enough.

962
01:38:11,198 --> 01:38:14,760
The captain will load you on,
and we're lifting off in 5 minutes.

963
01:38:14,853 --> 01:38:18,066
Ian, Louise, it was an honor
to work with you.

964
01:38:19,353 --> 01:38:21,015
Good luck.

965
01:38:24,127 --> 01:38:25,822
Hey, Colonel...

966
01:38:32,603 --> 01:38:35,090
I'm gonna find out
where we're going.

967
01:38:42,353 --> 01:38:44,353
Wake up, Mommy.

968
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:21,785
Dr. Banks.

969
01:39:23,043 --> 01:39:24,457
A pleasure.

970
01:39:24,737 --> 01:39:28,063
General Shang,
the pleasure is mine, really.

971
01:39:28,634 --> 01:39:30,579
Your president said,

972
01:39:30,677 --> 01:39:34,107
he was honored to host me
at the celebration.

973
01:39:34,141 --> 01:39:36,140
- Yeah.
- But, I confess...

974
01:39:36,954 --> 01:39:40,280
The only reason why I'm here is to...

975
01:39:40,983 --> 01:39:42,804
meet you in person.

976
01:39:43,907 --> 01:39:46,655
Me? Well, I'm flattered.
Thank you.

977
01:39:47,539 --> 01:39:51,539
18 months ago, you did
something remarkable.

978
01:39:52,531 --> 01:39:56,203
Something not even my superior has done.

979
01:39:58,009 --> 01:40:01,009
- What's that?
- You changed my mind.

980
01:40:03,617 --> 01:40:07,297
You're the reason for this unification.

981
01:40:08,196 --> 01:40:11,741
All because you reached out to me
on my private number.

982
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:17,975
Your private number?
General I don't know your private number.

983
01:40:25,011 --> 01:40:26,730
Now you know.

984
01:40:28,885 --> 01:40:32,195
I do not claim to know how
your mind works, but...

985
01:40:33,047 --> 01:40:36,422
I believe it was important
for you to say that.

986
01:40:38,196 --> 01:40:40,196
I called you didn't I?

987
01:40:41,028 --> 01:40:42,708
Yes, you did.

988
01:40:54,844 --> 01:40:56,374
Louise.

989
01:41:12,092 --> 01:41:14,303
Alright, let's shut down the system.

990
01:41:14,357 --> 01:41:15,772
Sir...

991
01:41:15,989 --> 01:41:18,308
there's a sat-line, here
dialing China.

992
01:41:20,782 --> 01:41:22,913
Here?! What do you mean, here?

993
01:41:24,587 --> 01:41:26,171
C'mon, c'mon.

994
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:29,241
Whose phone is it?

995
01:41:33,359 --> 01:41:35,163
It's your phone, sir.

996
01:41:41,953 --> 01:41:43,793
Search base camp, now.

997
01:41:43,818 --> 01:41:45,988
Find out who's using that phone.

998
01:41:46,047 --> 01:41:48,433
- Hold onto those co-ordinates.
- Yes, sir.

999
01:41:49,687 --> 01:41:51,279
What do I say?

1000
01:41:52,046 --> 01:41:53,638
What do I say?

1001
01:42:06,953 --> 01:42:09,349
I will never forget what you said.

1002
01:42:13,184 --> 01:42:15,153
<i>Hello, who is this?</i>

1003
01:42:20,366 --> 01:42:23,205
You told me my wife's dying words.

1004

01:42:29,121 --> 01:42:30,980

We found the source
of the phone call.

1010
01:42:42,591 --> 01:42:45,336
It's in the Clean Room.
Waiting for instructions.

1011
01:42:45,410 --> 01:42:46,895
<i>...have the courage to save the world</i>

1012
01:42:47,206 --> 01:42:48,960
What are you doing?

1013
01:42:49,819 --> 01:42:51,818
- What are you doing?
- Changing someone's mind.

1014
01:42:51,851 --> 01:42:53,850
- Buy me 20 seconds.
- We don't have time.

1015
01:42:53,874 --> 01:42:57,058
No, trust me. Buy me 20 seconds.
Do you trust me? - OK!

1016
01:42:57,613 --> 01:42:59,559
<i>- General...
- What?</i>

1017
01:43:00,848 --> 01:43:02,461

Yes.

01:44:05,350 --> 01:44:08,800
<i>Scientists from around the world
are sifting through information received...</i>

1037
01:44:08,833 --> 01:44:11,706
<i>the Russian armed forces are
now revealing the information</i>

1038
01:44:11,745 --> 01:44:14,652
<i>they've acquired from both their
landing sites and...</i>

1039
01:44:14,677 --> 01:44:18,980
<i>...one of the 12 pieces of this puzzle,
that is being slowly put together.</i>

1040
01:46:08,005 --> 01:46:10,481
So, Hannah...

1041
01:46:12,021 --> 01:46:14,107
this is where your story begins,

1042
01:46:16,692 --> 01:46:18,692
the day they departed.

1043
01:46:22,732 --> 01:46:24,355
Are you alright?

1044
01:46:27,443 --> 01:46:29,816
Despite knowing the journey...

1045
01:46:30,270 --> 01:46:32,003
and where it leads...

1046
01:46:34,951 --> 01:46:36,810
I embrace it.

1047
01:46:39,129 --> 01:46:41,950
And I welcome every moment of it.

1048
01:46:42,583 --> 01:46:44,130
Oo-wooh!

1049
01:46:45,177 --> 01:46:46,599
Oh!

1050
01:46:57,224 --> 01:47:01,410
H-A-N-N-A-H.

1051
01:47:15,573 --> 01:47:17,167
Now backward, H...

1052
01:47:17,264 --> 01:47:20,713
A-N-N-A-H.

1053
01:47:20,918 --> 01:47:22,268
Hannah.

1054
01:47:22,342 --> 01:47:23,929
You ready, baby?

1055
01:47:29,385 --> 01:47:31,014
- Perfect.
- M-hmm....

1056
01:47:31,039 --> 01:47:32,852
All right, see-ya.

1057
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:36,409
Daddy!

1058
01:47:45,305 --> 01:47:46,628
You OK?

1059
01:47:46,653 --> 01:47:48,617
I'm just gonna roll over ya.

1060
01:47:48,695 --> 01:47:50,320
Roarrr!

1061
01:47:51,230 --> 01:47:52,965
Are you ready?

1062
01:47:57,012 --> 01:47:59,012
Oh, guess what? Star stuff.

1063
01:48:01,161 --> 01:48:03,160
- Ian.
- Yeah.

1064
01:48:04,153 --> 01:48:06,988
If you see your whole life,
from start to finish...

1065
01:48:09,622 --> 01:48:11,622
Would you change things?

1066
01:48:17,692 --> 01:48:19,422
Maybe I'd...

1067
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:22,476
say what I feel more often,
I dunno.

1068
01:48:24,496 --> 01:48:25,957
Hm.

1069
01:48:38,807 --> 01:48:41,103
Y'know, I've had my head
tilted up to the stars

1070
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:43,017
for as long as I can remember.

1071
01:48:45,674 --> 01:48:48,190
Y'know what surprised me the most?

1072
01:48:50,043 --> 01:48:52,043
It wasn't meeting them.

1073
01:48:56,906 --> 01:48:58,734
It was meeting you.

1074
01:49:39,370 --> 01:49:42,183
I forgot how good it felt
to be held by you.

1075
01:49:52,003 --> 01:49:53,920
You wanna make a baby?

1076
01:50:28,642 --> 01:50:30,985
Yes... yeah.
