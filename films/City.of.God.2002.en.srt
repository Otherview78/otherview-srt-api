00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,079
CITY OF GOD

2
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:57,879
Fuck, the chicken's got away!
Go after that chicken, man!

3
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,682
Go on, for fuck's sake!

4
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,920
Get that chicken!

5
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,572
If it’s a good photo,
I'll get a job at the paper.

6
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,939
-You think so, Rocket?
-Gotta take the risk.

7
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:32,777
You'd risk your life
for a picture? Forget it!

8
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,686
You think I want to meet up
with that motherfucking hood?

9
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:41,592
Get that chicken, bro!

10
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,889
Motherfucker! I told you
to grab that chicken!

11
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,227
Outta my way!

12
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,437
Get that chicken!

13
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,786
If Li’l Z' catches you,
he'll kill you.

14
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,425
Yeah, well,
he's gotta find me first.

15
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:30,001
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!
Get that chicken!

16
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,876
Shit! The cops!

17
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,344
Don't fucking run off!

18
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,346
Give me that.

19
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,421
Hey, Melonhead! You fucking fag!

20
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,981
A picture could change
my life, but...

21
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:50,458
in the City of God, if you
run away, they get you...

22
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,522
...and if you stay, they get you too.
-They’re coming for us!

23
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,396
It's been that way
ever since I was a kid...

24
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:04,041
THE SIXTIES

25
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,383
You’re useless, man!

26
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,418
-Go get the ball!
-Fucking useless!

27
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,718
Hey, kid!

28
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,952
Give me the ball, I wanna play.

29
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,291
-It’s not yours.
-You wanna mess with me?

30
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,935
Fuck off.

31
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:35,301
-What’s your name?
-Sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.

32
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:38,033
-My name’s Rocket.
-Some advice, Rocket...

33
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,808
Don’t let Li’l Dice
touch that ball. He sucks.

34
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:44,306
-You lose, pal.
-Go, Shaggy!

35
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,747
That's Shaggy.

36
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,354
To tell the story of the City of God,
I have to start with him.

37
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,581
8, 9, 10, 11...

38
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,263
But in order to tell Shaggy's story, I
must tell the story of the Tender Trio.

39
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:02,662
Well, Shaggy? The gas truck’s coming.
What are you fucking around for?

40
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,803
You’re not gonna chicken out...

41
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,668
THE STORY OF THE TENDER TRIO

42
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,808
The notorious Tender Trio
was legendary in the City of God.

43
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,578
Shaggy...

44
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,950
Clipper...

45
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,092
and Goose.

46
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:32,759
Tagging along were always
Li’l Dice and Benny...

47
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,899
Shaggy's brother.

48
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,832
I never had the courage
to follow my brother, Goose.

49
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,382
Okay, let’s go.

50
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,177
Come on, Goose.

51
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,943
Let’s go!

52
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,899
Stop! Stop!
Stop this fucker!

53
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:15,505
Stop or I’ll shoot, motherfucker!

54
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,006
Get out!

55
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:23,474
Hurry up, asshole!
Gimme the money!

56
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,344
Who wants gas?

57
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:38,454
More! You wanna die for your
boss’ damn money?

58
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,655
Shitloads of money here!

59
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,100
You see, asshole?

60
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,265
Asshole!

61
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,441
Fuck! The cops!

62
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,872
Let’s get outta here!

63
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,649
Clear out! The place is
crawling with cops!

64
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:21,668
-Shaggy!
-The ball, Goose, it’s yours!

65
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:34,212
Back then, I thought
the guys in the Tender Trio...

66
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,581
were the most dangerous hoods
in Rio.

67
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,225
Here! Buy some new balls.

68
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:45,229
But they were just amateurs.

69
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,093
-Even my brother, Goose.
-Rocket, give this money to dad.

70
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,572
But don’t tell him it’s from me.

71
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,006
Okay?

72
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,204
-Hey, Stringy!
-Yeah?

73
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,679
Look how much I’ve got.

74
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,899
We came to the City of God
hoping to find paradise.

75
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:29,768
Many families were homeless
due to flooding...

76
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,376
and acts of arson
in the ghettos.

77
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,513
-A light post!
-We’ll have electricity!

78
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,876
The bigwigs in government
didn't joke around.

79
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,019
Homeless? Off to City of God!

80
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,281
There was no electricity,
paved streets or transportation.

81
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:48,688
But for the rich and powerful
our problems didn't matter.

82
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,897
We were too far removed...

83
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,566
from the picture postcard image
of Rio de Janeiro.

84
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,014
Do you think I can become
a lifeguard one day?

85
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,051
I don’t know.

86
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:19,122
Being a lifeguard is better
than a fishmonger.

87
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,850
I don’t want to sell fish.
It stinks.

88
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,761
-Are you insulting your father?
-No.

89
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:28,467
So what do you want to be?

90
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,495
I don’t know.

91
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,297
-Not a hood or a policeman.
-Why not?

92
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,668
I’m scared of getting shot.

93
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,615
Put that thing away, kid.
Are you nuts?

94
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:47,308
Pointing that gun at me?

95
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,751
Take it easy with the kid, Goose.
Li’l Dice is with me.

96
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,790
Right, I'm a gangster too.

97
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,621
-That gas truck didn't bring much.
-So what?

98
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:00,458
-We rob gas trucks every day.
-One today, another tomorrow.

99
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,961
No, we need to rob
some rich guy’s house.

100
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,603
That’s the only
way to get outta here.

101
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,104
Hell, no. What you need
is to follow my plan.

102
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,741
That’s it.

103
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:15,039
The little fart’s getting
too big for his britches!

104
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,354
He gets high and starts
talking bullshit.

105
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:29,722
You two junkies aren't worth
half as much as that kid.

106
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,590
What you got in mind, Li’l Dice?

107
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,396
To be a real hood you need
more than just a gun. You need ideas.

108
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,701
And Li’l Dice had them.

109
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,369
-Is that the motel?
-Yeah.

110
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:53,514
We go in, grab the money and
get out. No killing, got that?

111
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:57,052
-I need this.
-Don’t touch my gun, kid.

112
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,450
Don’t ever do that again.

113
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:00,249
-Don’t point at me.
-Fuck you.

114
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:04,122
-Don’t point your finger at me!
-Stop acting like a baby!

115
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,024
Here’s yours.

116
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,632
-Awesome!
-Let’s go!

117
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,359
-Not so fast!
-What?

118
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,038
You stay here and keep watch.

119
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:19,608
If the cops come, shoot that
window over there.

120
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:22,713
-Why me? Let that dork do that.
-Look...

121
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:28,114
I gave you this great plan, for free...
While that guy’s absolutely useless!

122
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,083
-You just had the idea.
-Exactly!

123
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,780
You’re just a kid, remember?

124
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,122
You cover us, okay?

125
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:41,896
You’ll get your turn, so cool it.
Stop trying to rush things.

126
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,592
You stay there.

127
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:51,535
This is a hold-up, bitch.

128
00:11:54,647 --> 00:12:01,314
You should be studying or working.
You don't even look like hoodlums.

129
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,513
Instead, you ought to be
working or studying, boy.

130
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,591
Shut up!
What a pain in the ass!

131
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,325
Okay, Clipper?

132
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:14,764
Shall we go in?

133
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,370
I didn't order anything.

134
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,705
It’s on the house, sir.
Hand over the money!

135
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,176
Keep calm, all I want
is your cash.

136
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,973
-Don’t point that...
-Your wallet...

137
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:44,919
Hey, man...

138
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,326
What kind of whorehouse is this?

139
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,129
-You from the church?
-Yes, brother.

140
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,197
Give it to me!

141
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,708
Slut!

142
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,743
You're old, fat and flabby!

143
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,014
Wanna take her place?

144
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,650
What’s going on?

145
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,488
-The cops! Let’s beat it!
-Let’s go!

146
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,126
Take that car.
I'll go get Li’l Dice.

147
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:28,939
Jesus, what a car!

148
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,681
-Something fucked up. Li’l Dice’s gone.
-The cops are shooting, let’s go!

149
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,112
Slow down! Hold on...

150
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,148
-You said you knew how to drive.
-I do, so cool it!

151
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,047
Turn! Watch out!

152
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,430
You fucking asshole!

153
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,199
Hey, I didn’t do it on purpose.

154
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:38,035
No one saw anything.
So keep your mouths shut, understand?

155
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,715
Hold on, I twisted my ankle.

156
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,249
Goose fucked up his ankle.

157
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,442
It fucking hurts.

158
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:52,556
Take him into the woods.
I’ll shoot to distract the cops.

159
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,090
-In God we trust.
-In God we trust.

160
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,263
Pass me the telephone, Penguin.

161
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:06,370
Shorty is another notorious guy
in the City of God.

162
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,597
But it's not yet time
to tell his story.

163
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:14,502
-It fucking hurts, Goose.
-Shut up.

164
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:19,947
-Wait up...
-You sound like a damn sissy, man.

165
00:15:24,022 --> 00:15:27,287
-Give me your hand! Climb up!
-No one saw anything?

166
00:15:27,492 --> 00:15:32,327
How odd! A car crashes
into a bar and no one saw a thing.

167
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,523
I suppose you didn’t see
anything either?

168
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:39,465
As usual, no one saw,
no one knows.

169
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,663
So what’s up, Shorty?

170
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,107
They’re hiding in the woods.

171
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,774
-Hello, Melonhead.
-How are you doing?

172
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:53,418
I have this feeling that
they’re out in the woods.

173
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:57,213
-The motherfuckers.
-They’re out in the woods.

174
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,153
Felipe, lock up the car.
Rangel, come with me.

175
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,829
I can’t see a thing.
How the hell can they see?

176
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:11,468
Fucking jungle.

177
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:19,802
-They stole a fortune at that motel.
-I know.

178
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,809
What if we took the money?

179
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:29,481
Are you crazy?
I’m not getting mixed up in that.

180
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,248
I want to exterminate these guys.

181
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:36,757
What? Since when is stealing from
niggers and thieves a crime?

182
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:43,762
It won't be hard to nab them.
I have a stoolie in the City.

183
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:15,294
-Did you hear those shots?
-If I catch one of them, I'll kill him.

184
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:28,569
Maracana!

185
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,075
Open the door.

186
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:37,083
-What’s the matter?
-The cops are after me.

187
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,863
Shaggy!

188
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:50,933
-Shaggy!
-The cops are on my ass!

189
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,367
-Hide me!
-Quick, come in.

190
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:06,548
Shit... I thought the cops
would be down there all night.

191
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,787
I had a vision, Goose.

192
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,253
You been smoking something?

193
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,426
-You've had a job, right?
-Yeah.

194
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,688
What’s it like?
What do people say?

195
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,025
I worked with my father.

196
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,795
And fathers talk a lot of shit.

197
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:31,065
You know what, Goose?
I'm getting out, I don't want to die.

198
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:36,680
-This gangster’s life isn’t for me.
-Wait! The cops are still down there.

199
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,544
I don’t give a shit.

200
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,382
I'm going back to the church.

201
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,083
He that dwells in the secret
place of the most High...

202
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,659
shall abide under the shadow of
the Almighty. I will say of the Lord...

203
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:55,128
He is my refuge and my fortress,
in Him will I trust.

204
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,564
Fear not the terror by night,
nor the arrow that flies by day...

205
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,797
nor the pestilence that walks
in darkness, nor the destruction...

206
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:06,876
-Stop, motherfucker!
-Don’t move!

207
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:10,648
Stop, or I’ll shoot!

208
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:17,312
...shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty.

209
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:22,289
The hold-up at the motel went down
as the bloodiest in history.

210
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,327
The destinies of the outlaws
then took different paths.

211
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,966
I don’t think this guy
was involved in the heist.

212
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:30,862
See here?

213
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:36,473
-He’s a worker, not a hoodlum.
-I’ll make him one now.

214
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:44,044
Destiny put Clipper
back into the hands of God.

215
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:49,748
Shaggy was in Bernice's hands.

216
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:54,916
And Goose was
in my father's hands.

217
00:19:55,126 --> 00:19:58,618
Why do you do these things?
You think I’m a fool?

218
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,526
From now on,
you’ll work with me.

219
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:05,897
Your younger brother
will keep an eye on you.

220
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,095
You listen to me.

221
00:20:08,306 --> 00:20:12,675
If I catch you with money that
isn't yours, I'll kill you.

222
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:18,748
That goes for you too. Get changed!
You start work immediately.

223
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:24,718
Having a hood as a brother sucks.
You always end up footing the bill.

224
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:29,189
Don’t worry.
Dad’s mad at me...

225
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:33,797
but he’ll get over it.

226
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,996
Give me that, Rocket. It’s not
for you. You have to study.

227
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:44,539
-Getting shot doesn’t scare you?
-I’m a hood because I got no brain.

228
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,577
But you’re smart.
You should study.

229
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,379
I go to school because
I don’t like physical work.

230
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:57,514
Promise me something... That you’ll
never touch this gun. Promise?

231
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:00,315
Let’s shake.

232
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:04,386
We’d better hurry.

233
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:09,191
I’m gonna sell a lot of fish.
And don’t laugh.

234
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,164
You grinned when I got slapped.

235
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:13,269
-Who, me?
-I saw you.

236
00:21:41,232 --> 00:21:44,724
What is it, Shaggy?
Cat got your tongue?

237
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,530
Your fidgeting behind me
makes me nervous.

238
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:51,903
-I'm thinking of what to say to you.
-You’re thinking, as well?

239
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,442
Don’t. It’ll be your downfall.

240
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:58,912
My heart has chosen you.
And I follow my heart.

241
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:01,551
Are you pulling my leg?

242
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,916
You never heard of
love at first sight?

243
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:10,551
-Hoods don’t love, they desire.
-You cut down everything I say.

244
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:14,459
Hoods don’t talk,
they smooth-talk.

245
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,999
Well, I’ll stop wasting
my breath on you.

246
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:21,730
Hoods don't stop,
they take a break.

247
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,232
Talking to you about love
sure is complicated.

248
00:22:25,443 --> 00:22:28,970
It’s not love,
it’s a con game.

249
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,697
It’s just that I love you.

250
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:52,328
You just might end up
convincing me...

251
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:19,319
After the hold-up, there were
constant police raids in the ghetto.

252
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:30,835
Every day, someone went to jail,
someone was nailed.

253
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:36,738
But no one had seen anything.
No one knew anything.

254
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:43,519
No one blabbed to the cops about
where the thieves were hiding out.

255
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,824
3 MONTHS LATER

256
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,186
Shaggy...

257
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:52,727
Why don’t you change your life?

258
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:56,895
Get a job instead of
lying around in bed all day.

259
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,935
-Good-for-nothing!
-What do you mean?

260
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:03,107
You think you can make money
working? Go ahead.

261
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:08,178
That’s right, Shaggy...
what do you think I do all day?

262
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:17,248
Take it easy, baby... you know all
I want is to be with you, have kids...

263
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:22,017
and a farm, raise chickens,
grow pot and get high.

264
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:26,095
Sure! For me, that’s
nothing but smooth-talk.

265
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:40,273
What? I almost got
rich with that motel job.

266
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:41,467
Are you kidding?

267
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,246
The cops are still looking for you
because of the deaths in the motel.

268
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:50,586
What deaths?
What are you talking about?

269
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:54,247
Did you see anything?
You don’t know shit, so shut up.

270
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,587
You weren’t there.
I didn’t kill anyone.

271
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:01,493
I bet it’s those fucking policemen,
and I’m the one taking the rap.

272
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:05,328
They even nabbed Li’l Dice.
So don't bring it up again!

273
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:09,603
-I don't care who did it.
-It wasn’t me.

274
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:14,074
Let me just say... I don’t want my
kid’s father to be a hoodlum.

275
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,678
You’re all alone, Shaggy.

276
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,780
-All alone?
-That’s right!

277
00:25:17,982 --> 00:25:19,779
-Clipper’s gone religious.
-Hallelujah!

278
00:25:19,984 --> 00:25:21,679
-Goose is working.
-Ass-kisser!

279
00:25:21,886 --> 00:25:24,013
-And you?
-I haven’t changed. So what?

280
00:25:24,222 --> 00:25:28,522
They’ve deserted me,
that’s all.

281
00:25:28,726 --> 00:25:30,887
Then I’m deserting you too.

282
00:25:31,095 --> 00:25:33,586
I’m splitting, Shaggy.
Come with me, if you want.

283
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:37,666
Otherwise, I’ll go alone.

284
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,344
Fish for sale!

285
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:57,521
My brother had promised
to stop messing around.

286
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:04,184
But a hood doesn't stop,
a hood takes a break.

287
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:07,694
Goose began messing around
with Shorty's wife.

288
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:12,603
I have trout. But for special
customers like you...

289
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:15,773
I also have a kisser fish.

290
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,306
Hey, that’s a mullet!

291
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:22,943
Doesn’t your husband...

292
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:25,274
go down on you?

293
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:27,975
No.

294
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:31,516
Mine, before entering me,
has to use his tongue.

295
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:36,387
For about half an hour.
And from behind? Do you let him?

296
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:41,793
-Good God, no. Doesn’t it hurt?
-The first few times.

297
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,731
Then you’ll see, it’s fantastic.
But you need a banana.

298
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,427
What for?

299
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,631
You’re missing the good things
in life, girl!

300
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:53,743
You take a banana, warm it up...

301
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,676
Put it up your thing, while he
takes you from behind.

302
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:02,080
It’s a real rush!
Ask your husband.

303
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:07,054
I couldn’t. You don’t know him.
He’s liable to beat me.

304
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:10,955
Try him. Men go wild
for smut like that.

305
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,903
Motherfucking nigger!

306
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,473
Slut!

307
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:29,044
Whoring bitch!

308
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:36,015
Rocket, give me your shorts.
Quick!

309
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,486
-Take them off, dammit!
-I'm not going naked in the street.

310
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:44,560
You want your brother to die?
Give me your shorts. Now!

311
00:27:44,762 --> 00:27:46,593
Give me your shirt.

312
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,535
Your shorts! Hurry up!

313
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:58,371
I knew it. It’s always me
who forks up for that bum.

314
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:09,352
The bastard ran off.
That's his brother.

315
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,749
-That brat there?
-I’ll castrate that fucker.

316
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:19,129
Fish! Fish for sale!

317
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:22,793
Hey, kid, come over here.

318
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:26,761
-Where’s your brother?
-He’s not working today.

319
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:29,701
-Oh yeah? Get in.
-I didn’t do anything.

320
00:28:29,907 --> 00:28:31,898
-Get in!
-What about my fish?

321
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,238
-Hurry it up, kid!
-I don’t want to lose my fish!

322
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:39,405
-Forget your fish.
-Sit your ass down.

323
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:43,417
-My father will kill me.
-That doesn’t matter.

324
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,961
Let’s go.
There’s nothing here.

325
00:28:57,168 --> 00:29:01,104
That day, my father swore he never
wanted to see my brother again.

326
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:02,932
Let’s go, Felipe.

327
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:09,443
And he never did. No one ever
saw him in the ghetto again.

328
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:13,105
The story of the Tender Trio
was coming to an end.

329
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:20,251
Li’l Dice? Shit, man. I thought you
were a goner at the motel.

330
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:27,125
-You’re fucking loaded!
-Don’t, Benny. That’s our money.

331
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:31,566
Fuck you. Cut the crap
and give me the money.

332
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:36,597
Benny... Tell your brother Shaggy
that Shorty is squealing.

333
00:29:36,974 --> 00:29:41,536
-I'm leaving the ghetto.
-But Shorty had his hands full...

334
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,593
Let’s go see, Stringy.

335
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,771
A neighbor called the police
before sunrise.

336
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,739
The tabloids went to town:

337
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:17,108
"Man Buries Wife Alive
in the City of God"

338
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,182
Along with reporters, the place
was swarming with cops.

339
00:30:20,384 --> 00:30:24,320
The hoodlums took off.

340
00:30:25,923 --> 00:30:28,790
-You wanna die?
-It’s you who’s gonna die...

341
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:33,123
if you don’t do what I say.
And show the lady more respect.

342
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,191
Let’s go, dammit!

343
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:40,131
-There are cops ahead.
-Fuck them, let’s go.

344
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:43,000
-Where to?
-Anywhere, just go.

345
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,579
-What’s the matter?
-Have mercy!

346
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:51,714
-This car’s a piece of junk.
-My ass! Start the damn thing!

347
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:54,441
It needs a push.

348
00:30:55,786 --> 00:30:57,651
Push, Shaggy!

349
00:30:57,855 --> 00:30:59,345
Push!

350
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:17,006
You?

351
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:20,508
You want to arrest the thieves?
Over there...

352
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:23,874
Nab that guy over there!

353
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:50,265
Run, Shaggy!

354
00:31:50,474 --> 00:31:53,875
Stop the car!

355
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:41,691
-This way! He’s over here.
-We got that sonofabitch!

356
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,632
-The bastard!
-He’s a murderer.

357
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:03,837
On the day Shaggy died
I remember the crowds...

358
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:06,710
and a camera.

359
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:10,182
I’d always wanted to have one.

360
00:33:11,922 --> 00:33:14,823
Let’s go to school.

361
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:25,802
-Well?
-Let’s go to the beach.

362
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:27,334
But we have an exam.

363
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:31,201
So what?

364
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:34,003
Everyone else is at the beach.

365
00:33:34,211 --> 00:33:37,203
Come on, let’s go!

366
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:40,816
She’s in a bikini,
but doesn’t want to go.

367
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:45,921
What’s that saying you have?

368
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:49,286
The sun is for everyone. The beach,
for those who deserve it.

369
00:33:51,862 --> 00:33:54,160
THE SEVENTIES

370
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,265
-Over here!
-I bought my first camera...

371
00:33:56,467 --> 00:34:00,733
when I was 16. Like all poor people,
I started at the bottom...

372
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,640
with the world's cheapest model.

373
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:07,540
So, Rocket?
How are things going?

374
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,804
Any luck getting laid yet?

375
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,107
Zilch.

376
00:34:13,382 --> 00:34:18,718
-Angelica. I was crazy about her.
-So, Rocket, still clicking away?

377
00:34:18,921 --> 00:34:23,119
She was gorgeous and the only
girl in our gang who screwed.

378
00:34:23,325 --> 00:34:25,316
I wanted to lose
my virginity with her.

379
00:34:25,527 --> 00:34:29,088
With her, buddy?
She’s got a guy.

380
00:34:29,298 --> 00:34:32,529
-So? I’m not jealous.
-Her father’s a sergeant.

381
00:34:32,735 --> 00:34:36,569
No one’s perfect.
Closer together!

382
00:34:36,772 --> 00:34:39,036
I was the official
photographer of our gang.

383
00:34:40,075 --> 00:34:46,105
The gang of groovies. Everyone
paid to have copies of the pictures.

384
00:34:52,421 --> 00:34:55,618
Thiago, move back a little.

385
00:34:55,824 --> 00:34:58,622
-Is this okay?
-Perfect.

386
00:35:06,201 --> 00:35:08,601
I need a joint.

387
00:35:08,804 --> 00:35:13,571
Instead of smoking, man,
you should snort coke. It’s far out.

388
00:35:13,776 --> 00:35:17,678
You snort, Thiago?
I prefer a good toke.

389
00:35:19,748 --> 00:35:23,013
If you like,
I can get it for you.

390
00:35:23,218 --> 00:35:27,848
You can? Then go on,
move your ass!

391
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:31,822
But the choice stuff is coke.
That’s a real nercotic.

392
00:35:32,027 --> 00:35:34,359
Narcotic!

393
00:35:36,665 --> 00:35:40,863
-Your mouth is all salty, Thiago.
-Screw you.

394
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,665
You want to be
a lifeguard, Stringy?

395
00:35:43,872 --> 00:35:46,363
-You’re never in the water.
-My dad’s a lifeguard.

396
00:35:46,575 --> 00:35:50,511
-I’ll bet you a beer I swim better.
-You’re on.

397
00:35:53,315 --> 00:35:57,115
If you like, I can go get you
a joint at Blacky’s.

398
00:36:10,165 --> 00:36:13,225
I’d have done anything
to please her...

399
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:16,929
Buy her pot, coke...

400
00:36:21,143 --> 00:36:26,479
I could go to the top dogs to buy
quality stuff at a good price...

401
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:34,018
because the local boss
was a former classmate: Blacky.

402
00:36:35,524 --> 00:36:38,220
-Who is it?
-Rocket.

403
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,695
-How are things down there?
-Fine.

404
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,993
-And the kids?
-Fine too.

405
00:36:47,202 --> 00:36:49,102
-You want to buy or smoke a joint?
-Buy.

406
00:36:49,304 --> 00:36:54,071
Come in, buddy.

407
00:36:55,644 --> 00:37:00,138
Who is it?

408
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,120
This was Blacky's turf.

409
00:37:07,322 --> 00:37:10,917
But it hadn't always been his.

410
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:15,922
-Hey, Blacky.
-Fuck, Li’l Dice.

411
00:37:16,131 --> 00:37:20,397
-You show up like this at my place?
-Who said it was your place?

412
00:37:21,904 --> 00:37:27,365
THE STORY OF THE APARTMENT
Dona Zelia began selling drugs here...

413
00:37:27,576 --> 00:37:31,569
when her husband died,
in order to raise her daughters.

414
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:37,184
She also gave away drugs to boys at
times in return for special favors.

415
00:37:37,386 --> 00:37:43,086
Her favorite was "Big Boy".
One day, he grew very big!

416
00:37:43,292 --> 00:37:48,355
Zelia's operation was so amateur that
he had no trouble seizing it from her.

417
00:37:49,264 --> 00:37:53,758
Big Boy used the neighborhood
kids as dealers.

418
00:37:54,303 --> 00:37:58,672
-What about my pot?
-Stick it up your ass.

419
00:37:58,874 --> 00:38:01,638
The best dealer...

420
00:38:03,278 --> 00:38:06,111
...was Carrot.

421
00:38:06,315 --> 00:38:08,943
-Can I have a sip?
-Sure.

422
00:38:09,151 --> 00:38:11,779
He earned Big Boy's trust...

423
00:38:11,987 --> 00:38:14,979
was promoted, and moved up to
become a manager.

424
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:18,853
Blacky, 20 for us and
5 for you, okay?

425
00:38:20,395 --> 00:38:23,296
One day a buddy of Carrot's
showed up.

426
00:38:23,498 --> 00:38:29,437
-His name was Aristotle.
-My wife needs an operation.

427
00:38:29,638 --> 00:38:35,975
His family had taken Carrot in
when he was down and out.

428
00:38:36,178 --> 00:38:38,942
He couldn't refuse to help
a brother in need.

429
00:38:39,147 --> 00:38:43,584
Here’s the dope. I want
the dough no later than Friday.

430
00:38:43,785 --> 00:38:46,618
-You’ve bailed me out, brother.
-Friday.

431
00:38:47,222 --> 00:38:51,056
He’s my buddy, practically
my brother, Big Boy.

432
00:38:51,259 --> 00:38:55,252
Give him another week.

433
00:38:57,466 --> 00:39:01,994
-Either you kill him, or I'll kill you.
-Carrot had no choice.

434
00:39:03,672 --> 00:39:08,200
-I said Friday.
-Don’t do it, man.

435
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:12,005
Carrot wanted to kill Big Boy,
but it wasn't necessary.

436
00:39:12,447 --> 00:39:16,440
Big Boy hadn't paid off the cops.
He died in jail.

437
00:39:19,688 --> 00:39:23,215
Carrot took everything
that belonged to Big Boy...

438
00:39:23,425 --> 00:39:27,054
but didn’t want the apartment...

439
00:39:27,262 --> 00:39:31,130
the place was ill-fated. Carrot gave it
to his most trusted dealer...

440
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:34,063
-Here. 150 bags.
-Blacky.

441
00:39:34,269 --> 00:39:36,396
Give me more. This place
is crawling with druggies.

442
00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:39,870
That's how he took over
the local trade.

443
00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:42,339
But not for long...

444
00:39:43,545 --> 00:39:45,809
Who is it?

445
00:39:46,014 --> 00:39:47,879
Go see.

446
00:39:58,827 --> 00:40:00,818
-Hey, Blacky.
-Fuck, Li’l Dice.

447
00:40:01,029 --> 00:40:04,897
-You show up like this at my place?
-Who said it was your place?

448
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,967
Yeah, who?

449
00:40:13,175 --> 00:40:15,075
-Something wrong, Li’l Dice?
-Li’l Dice, my ass.

450
00:40:15,277 --> 00:40:17,541
My name is Li’l Z’ now.

451
00:40:17,746 --> 00:40:20,146
THE STORY OF LI’L Z’

452
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:23,374
Li’l Z' had always wanted
to be boss of the City of God...

453
00:40:23,585 --> 00:40:27,919
ever since he was little
and was called "Li’l Dice".

454
00:40:31,726 --> 00:40:34,991
They’re having fun,
and not me?

455
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,070
I want to get out of here.

456
00:40:47,876 --> 00:40:51,903
What, kid? Your friend took
everything. What do you want?

457
00:40:58,086 --> 00:41:01,351
That night, Li'l Dice
satisfied his thirst to kill...

458
00:41:01,556 --> 00:41:04,081
though he knew Shaggy would
never forgive him.

459
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:15,766
To avoid being punished
he left the City of God.

460
00:41:16,972 --> 00:41:19,702
He had to work hard for peanuts.

461
00:41:24,813 --> 00:41:27,976
-Yeah, Benny!
-Li’l Dice and Benny managed well.

462
00:41:30,018 --> 00:41:31,781
They had the gift of crime.

463
00:41:31,987 --> 00:41:34,751
-You have more money than me.
-It was my idea.

464
00:41:34,956 --> 00:41:38,119
The only problem was running into
an older hoodlum...

465
00:41:38,326 --> 00:41:41,557
...like my brother, Goose.
-Li’l Dice?

466
00:41:41,763 --> 00:41:45,096
Shit, man. I thought
you were a goner at the motel.

467
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,996
You’re fucking loaded!

468
00:41:48,203 --> 00:41:51,866
Don’t, Benny. That’s our money.

469
00:41:52,407 --> 00:41:56,776
Benny, tell your brother Shaggy...

470
00:41:56,978 --> 00:42:01,506
that Shorty is squealing.
I’m leaving the ghetto.

471
00:42:04,085 --> 00:42:05,552
Goose!

472
00:42:07,956 --> 00:42:11,392
From Shaggy. You'll need it.

473
00:42:31,446 --> 00:42:34,074
From one hit to the next,
Li’l Dice grew up.

474
00:42:34,282 --> 00:42:38,685
At 18, he was the most
respected hood in the City of God.

475
00:42:38,887 --> 00:42:40,946
You’re of age now, watch out!

476
00:42:41,156 --> 00:42:44,455
He was one of the most
wanted robbers in Rio.

477
00:42:57,739 --> 00:42:59,400
Li’l Dice, how’s it going?

478
00:42:59,608 --> 00:43:03,237
Happy birthday.
I’m so glad you’ve turned 18...

479
00:43:03,445 --> 00:43:06,676
-Get lost, Tuba!
-Excuse me, amigo...

480
00:43:07,315 --> 00:43:09,374
Give me a beer!

481
00:43:09,584 --> 00:43:13,213
Didn’t you see me, prick?

482
00:43:13,421 --> 00:43:15,286
-Sorry, man.
-Up yours!

483
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:18,857
The next time,
I’ll waste you, asshole!

484
00:43:20,262 --> 00:43:22,287
Fag!

485
00:43:22,631 --> 00:43:25,566
Li'l Dice was ready for anything.

486
00:43:25,767 --> 00:43:27,701
I wanna talk.

487
00:43:27,902 --> 00:43:30,894
-And he was itching to start.
-Who are the fattest cats here?

488
00:43:31,339 --> 00:43:35,571
-There are tons of them.
-Look at Jerry Adriani...

489
00:43:35,777 --> 00:43:39,873
gold chain, snazzy clothes.

490
00:43:40,081 --> 00:43:42,276
Look at Pereira
and the chick he’s with...

491
00:43:42,484 --> 00:43:46,352
-Bernice. She was my brother’s girl.
-Check out his car.

492
00:43:46,955 --> 00:43:51,085
Then there’s Blacky.
Covered in gold.

493
00:43:51,293 --> 00:43:53,955
Gold chain, gold watch...

494
00:43:54,162 --> 00:43:57,325
Look at Carrot, and his car.

495
00:43:57,532 --> 00:44:01,263
-They’re all dealers.
-They’re all fucking loaded.

496
00:44:01,469 --> 00:44:03,494
Hold-ups bring in chickenshit.

497
00:44:03,705 --> 00:44:06,503
-The big bucks are in drugs.
-I see.

498
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:08,699
Especially in selling coke.

499
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,174
-But you need money.
-Not really...

500
00:44:11,379 --> 00:44:15,076
We’ll kill these clowns
and take over their business.

501
00:44:15,283 --> 00:44:18,047
-When do we start?
-Now.

502
00:44:27,562 --> 00:44:31,521
Exu-the-Devil is the light
that shines forth.

503
00:44:31,733 --> 00:44:34,327
He brought you here.

504
00:44:34,536 --> 00:44:39,735
Why remain in the City of God
where God has forgotten you?

505
00:44:40,608 --> 00:44:45,011
I know what you want.
You want power.

506
00:44:45,213 --> 00:44:49,343
I have something which will
give it to you.

507
00:44:50,885 --> 00:44:55,379
To change your fate,
I give you my protector, boy.

508
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:59,185
But you mustn't fornicate
with the amulet...

509
00:44:59,394 --> 00:45:01,862
otherwise...

510
00:45:02,931 --> 00:45:05,331
you’ll die.

511
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:08,234
The boy is no longer called
Li’l Dice...

512
00:45:08,436 --> 00:45:10,427
but Li’l Z’.

513
00:45:10,638 --> 00:45:14,199
Li’l Z’ will grow up.

514
00:45:14,509 --> 00:45:18,309
You stick with me,
I’ll stick with you.

515
00:45:29,591 --> 00:45:33,049
Li’l Dice became Li'l Z'
and he began to kill.

516
00:45:34,095 --> 00:45:40,762
He started one morning,
taking over Jerry Adriani's racket.

517
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:46,339
By that night, almost all
of the rackets in the ghetto were his.

518
00:45:46,541 --> 00:45:49,942
The only business he didn't
touch was Carrot's...

519
00:45:50,145 --> 00:45:54,104
since he was a friend of Benny's.
All that was left was the apartment...

520
00:45:54,315 --> 00:45:55,373
But that would be easy.

521
00:46:00,155 --> 00:46:03,215
Who is it?

522
00:46:09,964 --> 00:46:11,829
-Hey, Blacky.
-Fuck, Li’l Dice.

523
00:46:12,033 --> 00:46:18,165
-You show up like this at my place?
-Who said it was your place?

524
00:46:18,373 --> 00:46:20,000
-Something wrong, Li’l Dice?
-Li’l Dice, my ass.

525
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:23,666
-My name is Li’l Z’ now.
-His name’s Li’l Z’, see?

526
00:46:23,878 --> 00:46:27,006
-You’re a goner, bastard.
-Don’t kill him. He understands.

527
00:46:27,215 --> 00:46:29,342
Right, Blacky?

528
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:34,079
It’s all yours, I don’t want anything.
I don’t want no trouble, okay?

529
00:46:34,289 --> 00:46:37,417
I should have taken this chance
to avenge my brother's death.

530
00:46:39,294 --> 00:46:43,993
You’ll live, but you’ll
work for us. Understand?

531
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:46,292
That's easy to say...

532
00:46:47,635 --> 00:46:50,832
-Where are you going?
-He’s clean, Li’l Z’.

533
00:46:51,406 --> 00:46:52,839
What’s your name, kid?

534
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:56,841
-Rocket.
-He’s Goose’s brother.

535
00:46:57,045 --> 00:46:59,639
-Goose?
-The late Goose.

536
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:03,113
Quick, kid. Run along.

537
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:07,778
Tell everyone that this business
now belongs to Li’l Z’.

538
00:47:07,989 --> 00:47:11,891
And that we'll be selling coke.
Got that?

539
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,989
Cocaine.

540
00:47:16,998 --> 00:47:19,933
-Where’s the turf?
-Over there, on the left.

541
00:47:20,134 --> 00:47:23,160
Selling drugs is like any
other business.

542
00:47:23,505 --> 00:47:25,405
The supplier
delivers the merchandise...

543
00:47:25,607 --> 00:47:28,337
which is then
packaged on the premises.

544
00:47:28,676 --> 00:47:32,476
It's done in an assembly line.

545
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,739
Boring as hell...

546
00:47:35,216 --> 00:47:39,243
Pot is wrapped up in "lids".

547
00:47:39,521 --> 00:47:42,217
Cocaine is put into packets...

548
00:47:42,957 --> 00:47:47,189
and then into bundles
of 10 or 100.

549
00:47:47,562 --> 00:47:50,429
You can even make a career
in dealing drugs.

550
00:47:50,632 --> 00:47:54,466
The kids start out
as delivery boys.

551
00:47:54,736 --> 00:47:58,729
They're paid to run errands
and take messages.

552
00:47:59,474 --> 00:48:02,466
Then they become lookouts.
If the police arrive...

553
00:48:02,677 --> 00:48:05,510
the kites disappear
and everyone scrams.

554
00:48:06,781 --> 00:48:10,376
Later, you become a dealer
or a "vapor".

555
00:48:10,585 --> 00:48:13,679
When the heat's on, the
"vapor" quickly evaporates.

556
00:48:13,888 --> 00:48:18,018
Moving up the ladder,
you have the "soldier".

557
00:48:18,259 --> 00:48:21,854
And if the guy is good at math,
he can become a manager...

558
00:48:22,063 --> 00:48:25,521
the boss' right-hand man.

559
00:48:26,968 --> 00:48:30,904
The police receive their part
and don’t make trouble.

560
00:48:33,107 --> 00:48:35,701
Since Li’l Z' killed off
all of his enemies...

561
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:40,870
there were no shoot-outs in the
City of God. You could drive there...

562
00:48:41,249 --> 00:48:44,776
The playboys felt safe
buying their drugs there.

563
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:50,884
The City teemed with addicts
and Li’l Z' grew rich.

564
00:48:51,826 --> 00:48:54,124
-Is it okay?
-It’s a deal.

565
00:48:57,799 --> 00:49:01,826
-I can’t decide which to wear.
-This one’s cool.

566
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:07,039
If dealing were legal, Li’l Z'
would have been man of the year.

567
00:49:10,311 --> 00:49:13,246
But things were risky for me.
I was afraid of him.

568
00:49:13,448 --> 00:49:17,646
-And he was everywhere.
-What a drag this guy is.

569
00:49:17,852 --> 00:49:22,983
Whenever I wanted to smoke a joint
I had to go see Carrot.

570
00:49:27,595 --> 00:49:30,496
Half a lid. Thanks.

571
00:49:31,633 --> 00:49:35,797
But it was worth it.
I only smoked with Angelica.

572
00:49:37,472 --> 00:49:40,339
She and Thiago had split up,
so I made my move.

573
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:46,343
-I was about to win her over...
-These pictures are really great.

574
00:49:46,547 --> 00:49:50,142
-You think so?
-I look good here.

575
00:49:50,351 --> 00:49:53,115
-You look beautiful everywhere.
-I’m serious.

576
00:49:53,321 --> 00:49:54,310
Me too.

577
00:49:57,225 --> 00:50:02,458
A setting sun,
a deserted beach... a long kiss...

578
00:50:02,664 --> 00:50:05,497
I was sure this was it...

579
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,691
But the Runts arrived.

580
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:12,535
Can I have a toke?

581
00:50:18,112 --> 00:50:19,306
Here.

582
00:50:19,514 --> 00:50:23,712
I’m going. See you later.

583
00:50:25,586 --> 00:50:28,885
Hold on, Angelica.

584
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,581
-Your joint, man.
-Keep it.

585
00:50:31,793 --> 00:50:34,125
What a cool guy.

586
00:50:37,098 --> 00:50:41,467
That was my first run
in with the Runts.

587
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,400
-Steak and fries, Benny.
-Great! Here...

588
00:50:53,914 --> 00:50:59,853
-A tip for you.
-Really? Thanks.

589
00:51:00,053 --> 00:51:02,351
-Wanna eat something?
-No.

590
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:09,757
-Wanna trade this watch?
-After Angelica left him...

591
00:51:09,963 --> 00:51:11,863
Thiago began snorting
more and more.

592
00:51:12,065 --> 00:51:15,159
-Is it your grandfather’s?
-No, my dad’s.

593
00:51:15,368 --> 00:51:19,668
When a guy is really hooked
he ends up in the hands of the dealer.

594
00:51:19,873 --> 00:51:22,000
-Two bags of ten.
-One of ten.

595
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:26,305
-Okay, one bag.
-For Thiago, it was different.

596
00:51:26,513 --> 00:51:30,005
-Watch out!
-Sorry, godfather.

597
00:51:30,383 --> 00:51:33,181
Godfather, my ass.
Did I baptize your kids?

598
00:51:33,386 --> 00:51:36,412
-I’m sorry.
-Now beat it.

599
00:51:39,025 --> 00:51:43,018
Blacky, lend me your bike.

600
00:52:06,486 --> 00:52:08,750
Hey, wanna race?

601
00:52:08,955 --> 00:52:12,413
-Where to?
-Up to the highway.

602
00:52:13,026 --> 00:52:15,961
-Okay.
-Ready? Go!

603
00:52:38,351 --> 00:52:42,185
-Pretty tough, wasn’t it?
-Yeah, you’re good.

604
00:52:42,389 --> 00:52:44,721
Where’d you buy those sneakers?

605
00:52:44,924 --> 00:52:47,518
-Not far from here.
-The shirt, as well?

606
00:52:47,727 --> 00:52:50,059
-No, uptown.
-Cool.

607
00:52:50,263 --> 00:52:52,493
It’s a designer shirt.

608
00:52:52,699 --> 00:52:55,031
If I give you money
can you buy me one?

609
00:52:55,235 --> 00:52:57,897
Shorts and a shirt?

610
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:02,438
Buy whatever you can.

611
00:53:05,111 --> 00:53:07,170
-What size are you?
-Measure me.

612
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,315
-With what, man?
-Shit, with your hand.

613
00:53:11,818 --> 00:53:14,548
Shoe size? Turn around.

614
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:28,290
-Hey, Benny!
-You got the digs?

615
00:53:31,304 --> 00:53:34,569
-Just one pair of pants?
-No, there’s more.

616
00:53:39,713 --> 00:53:40,975
-You like it?
-Yeah.

617
00:53:42,248 --> 00:53:44,580
There’s some change.

618
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:48,086
-Keep it.
-Cool.

619
00:53:56,596 --> 00:53:59,190
This is Benny.

620
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,895
-This is Rocket.
-Hi. I know him.

621
00:54:28,361 --> 00:54:31,023
I’ve become a playboy.

622
00:54:32,966 --> 00:54:37,096
Hey, gangsters, listen to this...

623
00:54:37,303 --> 00:54:39,134
Watch out...

624
00:54:39,339 --> 00:54:43,002
Groovies shake their asses
before laying a big one.

625
00:54:46,479 --> 00:54:48,208
Oh, yeah?

626
00:54:49,082 --> 00:54:51,778
Fuck off, you bastards!

627
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,920
Making fun of me?

628
00:54:59,192 --> 00:55:01,387
Asshole!

629
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:20,507
Benny, didn’t I tell you to shoot Carrot?
He’s endangering the ghetto.

630
00:55:20,713 --> 00:55:24,240
-Cool it. Go talk to him.
-I’m gonna kill that fucker.

631
00:55:24,451 --> 00:55:27,318
-Stop trying to wipe out everyone.
-I’m gonna kill him.

632
00:55:29,656 --> 00:55:32,648
Don’t worry, Angelica.
The guys in here are cool.

633
00:55:32,859 --> 00:55:35,453
Sure, I’m not worried.

634
00:55:35,929 --> 00:55:39,763
You gonna dance, Benny?
What about Carrot?

635
00:55:39,966 --> 00:55:44,027
Go on, buddy. Go talk to the guy.

636
00:55:44,237 --> 00:55:47,798
Benny was the coolest hood
in the City of God.

637
00:55:48,007 --> 00:55:51,170
He gave away pot,
paid for drinks.

638
00:55:51,678 --> 00:55:54,772
Li’l Z' was the opposite.
He had one obsession:

639
00:55:54,981 --> 00:55:56,949
to be the boss of the ghetto.

640
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:00,415
He wanted an excuse to take over
Carrot's racket.

641
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,247
-Hey, Carrot.
-What’s up?

642
00:56:02,455 --> 00:56:06,755
You shouldn’t let the Runts
do hold-ups in the ghetto.

643
00:56:07,327 --> 00:56:10,125
You look after your section,
I’ll look after mine.

644
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:14,198
Got that? I'm gonna get a drink.

645
00:56:22,075 --> 00:56:26,978
-Hey, Rocket! How’s it going?
-Great.

646
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:30,240
-Hey, Benny!
-How’s it going?

647
00:56:31,017 --> 00:56:33,986
-Hey, Thiago. How are you?
-Good.

648
00:56:35,054 --> 00:56:36,521
-May I?
-Sure...

649
00:56:36,723 --> 00:56:39,021
Wanna dance?

650
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:45,987
-Is it okay at your place?
-No problem.

651
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:49,862
My parents are out.
You’ll be all alone with her.

652
00:56:50,069 --> 00:56:54,472
-You can lose your virginity tonight.
-Not so loud, man!

653
00:56:54,674 --> 00:56:56,403
Everyone will hear.

654
00:56:57,644 --> 00:57:00,044
-You’re beautiful.
-Thank you.

655
00:57:00,246 --> 00:57:04,706
-Shit!
-Nothing’s happening.

656
00:57:11,925 --> 00:57:16,225
Look, man, I know the Runts
are associated with you.

657
00:57:16,429 --> 00:57:20,092
Think I'm a sucker, you little brat?
You want to take my racket?

658
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:24,498
I want to talk to you
because you’re fucking useless.

659
00:57:24,704 --> 00:57:25,693
Get your hand away!

660
00:57:25,905 --> 00:57:28,931
The Runts are screwing up
our security, man.

661
00:57:29,142 --> 00:57:30,473
Give the baby his bottle.

662
00:57:30,677 --> 00:57:33,077
Carrot, just ask the kids
to cool it, okay?

663
00:57:33,279 --> 00:57:36,680
Carrot’s useless. He lets the Runts
do hold-ups in his section.

664
00:57:36,883 --> 00:57:39,818
The police come around and
that’s bad for business.

665
00:57:40,086 --> 00:57:43,681
I’ll do it only because
I like you.

666
00:57:44,023 --> 00:57:45,684
But you need to change
that baby's diapers.

667
00:57:45,892 --> 00:57:49,726
I’ll show you who’s the baby...

668
00:57:49,929 --> 00:57:55,424
Tell the kids that in my ghetto
no one robs or rapes!

669
00:57:55,635 --> 00:57:57,102
No wonder you’re "Little" Z’!

670
00:58:00,273 --> 00:58:05,210
The Runts were kids who didn't
respect the laws of the ghetto.

671
00:58:05,411 --> 00:58:08,869
They would mug residents,
hold up bakeries...

672
00:58:09,082 --> 00:58:11,277
especially in Carrot's section.

673
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:17,781
What are you doing?

674
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:24,053
-You rob me all the time!
-But they didn't know...

675
00:58:24,263 --> 00:58:26,595
that the City had a boss now.

676
00:58:28,468 --> 00:58:30,493
THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING US

677
00:58:30,703 --> 00:58:34,537
The City had become
much safer for residents.

678
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:38,742
There were hardly
any hold-ups now.

679
00:58:38,978 --> 00:58:40,275
You just had to go see Li’l Z'.

680
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,608
-Let’s go.
-Don’t hurt the Runts.

681
00:58:43,816 --> 00:58:46,717
I won’t touch them.

682
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:52,358
-Hi, Steak.
-How’s it going, Li’l Z’?

683
00:58:52,558 --> 00:58:55,254
-Wanna take a walk, Steak?
-With you? Hold on...

684
00:58:57,697 --> 00:59:00,689
Mom, I’m going out with
my friends.

685
00:59:13,146 --> 00:59:15,808
That’s the best chicken
I ever ate.

686
00:59:16,282 --> 00:59:20,343
-The old guy was scared shitless.
-Feeling sorry for him?

687
00:59:20,553 --> 00:59:23,579
You’re crazy, man!

688
00:59:31,998 --> 00:59:34,865
Why not stick up
a bank or a supermarket?

689
00:59:35,068 --> 00:59:39,505
-Peanuts. Drugs are where it’s at.
-Yeah, selling drugs.

690
00:59:39,706 --> 00:59:46,009
But you have to start out as a delivery
boy. You wanna be a delivery boy?

691
00:59:46,212 --> 00:59:51,445
It’s a rip off.
It takes a long time to move up.

692
00:59:51,751 --> 00:59:56,085
You have to wait till an older guy
gets killed to move up.

693
00:59:56,322 --> 00:59:59,485
I don't wanna wait till some guy
croaks. I'm gonna do what Li’l Z' did.

694
00:59:59,692 --> 01:00:02,388
I'm gonna wipe them all out.

695
01:00:02,595 --> 01:00:05,428
Talking about me, kid?
The boss is here.

696
01:00:09,535 --> 01:00:11,093
Come back, you brat!

697
01:00:15,475 --> 01:00:22,142
-They’re quick, those kids.
-They run fast.

698
01:00:23,382 --> 01:00:26,283
They’re all gone except you.
Any others?

699
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:36,522
You’re gonna pay
for the ones that escaped.

700
01:00:36,729 --> 01:00:40,893
You choose. Shall I shoot you
in the hand or foot?

701
01:00:41,501 --> 01:00:43,401
Come on, choose!

702
01:00:43,603 --> 01:00:46,367
Hand or foot?

703
01:00:48,908 --> 01:00:51,638
Choose, for fuck's sake!

704
01:00:59,385 --> 01:01:02,513
-Hand.
-The little hand, eh?

705
01:01:11,397 --> 01:01:13,490
Cool.

706
01:01:14,767 --> 01:01:19,170
Hey, Steak’n’fries,
let’s see what you’re made of.

707
01:01:19,372 --> 01:01:22,705
Choose and then kill
one of them.

708
01:01:22,909 --> 01:01:26,709
-Leave it. I’ll do it.
-Butt out, Tuba. This is for him.

709
01:01:29,549 --> 01:01:31,380
Go on, Steak.

710
01:01:31,584 --> 01:01:35,020
Go on, choose one and shoot.

711
01:01:35,221 --> 01:01:38,247
Come on, I haven’t got all day.

712
01:01:38,457 --> 01:01:41,290
Kill one of them.

713
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:47,624
Let’s go, Steak.
I’m in a hurry.

714
01:01:47,834 --> 01:01:51,201
I wanna see what you’re made of.

715
01:01:58,878 --> 01:02:02,211
Well done!

716
01:02:02,415 --> 01:02:03,643
You did it.

717
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:09,650
-You’re one of us. Give me five.
-Very good, Steak.

718
01:02:12,325 --> 01:02:18,992
Get up, brat. Go back
to your rat hole. Without limping!

719
01:02:19,832 --> 01:02:24,132
Tell your buddies that no one
robs in Li’l Z”s ghetto.

720
01:02:24,337 --> 01:02:27,101
Go now.
And no limping, okay?

721
01:02:29,408 --> 01:02:31,638
Cool, Li’l Z'.

722
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:47,886
While Li’l Z' was winning
the respect of the residents...

723
01:02:48,361 --> 01:02:51,330
Benny was winning
Angelica's heart.

724
01:02:51,864 --> 01:02:56,494
As for me, I was still
a virgin, single and broke.

725
01:02:56,702 --> 01:02:58,966
I had no choice.

726
01:03:00,072 --> 01:03:03,007
SUCKER’S LIFE

727
01:03:03,209 --> 01:03:06,940
I had to take a job
in a supermarket.

728
01:03:07,146 --> 01:03:11,674
I worked long hours for chicken feed.
I wanted to be laid off...

729
01:03:11,884 --> 01:03:15,911
so I could buy a camera
with the severance pay.

730
01:03:17,123 --> 01:03:20,251
But things didn't
work out that way.

731
01:03:23,329 --> 01:03:25,991
-It’s the guy on the beach.
-Hey, bro!

732
01:03:26,198 --> 01:03:28,894
-Still smoking good stuff?
-Yeah.

733
01:03:29,101 --> 01:03:30,762
That guy’s too cool.

734
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:33,530
Hey, kid. Come here.
Lift up your shirt.

735
01:03:38,544 --> 01:03:41,911
We give these ghetto kids a chance
and they don't appreciate it.

736
01:03:42,114 --> 01:03:45,606
-What about my severance pay?
-What severance pay?

737
01:03:45,818 --> 01:03:49,777
That fucking manager thought
I was part of the gang.

738
01:03:49,989 --> 01:03:55,154
You’re fired for serious misconduct.
Get out. Immediately!

739
01:03:55,361 --> 01:03:58,819
I didn’t get a single cent.

740
01:04:12,611 --> 01:04:14,772
It was like a message from God:

741
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:20,917
"Honesty doesn't pay, sucker’."

742
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:24,385
FLIRTING WITH CRIME

743
01:04:33,566 --> 01:04:37,297
The bus sure took a long time to come.
I should already be at work.

744
01:04:38,104 --> 01:04:41,505
Shit, hide that gun.
Are you nuts?

745
01:04:41,707 --> 01:04:43,368
It was Goose’s.
It’s broken anyway.

746
01:04:43,576 --> 01:04:46,636
It’s not our fault, the company
runs few buses on this line.

747
01:04:46,879 --> 01:04:51,475
It’s never anyone’s fault.
It’s always someone else’s.

748
01:04:51,684 --> 01:04:55,643
But it’s the workers who suffer.
And then, they make us squeeze!

749
01:04:55,855 --> 01:04:57,982
Have a nice evening, ma'am.

750
01:05:00,493 --> 01:05:02,859
I know that guy.

751
01:05:03,062 --> 01:05:05,155
He lives in the City.
He’ll recognize us.

752
01:05:05,364 --> 01:05:07,958
So? He couldn’t care less
if we take his boss’ money.

753
01:05:08,167 --> 01:05:10,431
Okay. Let’s go.

754
01:05:13,339 --> 01:05:16,797
Well, boys? Aren’t you from
the City of God?

755
01:05:17,243 --> 01:05:18,540
Yeah.

756
01:05:18,744 --> 01:05:21,907
I’ll let one of you through
without paying.

757
01:05:26,185 --> 01:05:30,315
You should study
so you can get out of the ghetto.

758
01:05:30,523 --> 01:05:33,390
It's too full of cops and
hoodlums.

759
01:05:33,592 --> 01:05:37,460
-Did you study?
-I was in school and in the army.

760
01:05:37,663 --> 01:05:40,826
I was the best marksman
in my barracks.

761
01:05:41,033 --> 01:05:43,558
This job was all
I could find afterwards.

762
01:05:43,769 --> 01:05:47,967
But I do karate.
If I’m hired somewhere...

763
01:05:48,174 --> 01:05:50,267
I’ll leave the ghetto.

764
01:05:50,776 --> 01:05:55,236
-Do you fight, then?
-I’m for peace and love.

765
01:05:55,614 --> 01:05:57,081
But if I have to...

766
01:05:57,283 --> 01:06:00,081
He didn't know he would have to.

767
01:06:00,286 --> 01:06:03,847
But not yet, it's not time
to tell Knockout Ned's story.

768
01:06:04,423 --> 01:06:06,584
-We should be going.
-Let’s go.

769
01:06:06,792 --> 01:06:07,781
-Good bye.
-Thanks.

770
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,491
See you.

771
01:06:14,767 --> 01:06:17,497
I couldn’t do it.
He was such a cool guy.

772
01:06:17,703 --> 01:06:20,866
Yeah, totally.
That’s Gerson’s brother.

773
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:24,072
Let’s go home.

774
01:06:26,212 --> 01:06:30,273
There’s nothing here
except that bakery over there.

775
01:06:30,483 --> 01:06:35,352
-What will you say?
-I don’t know. "This is a hold-up."

776
01:06:37,456 --> 01:06:39,048
Here’s my number.

777
01:06:39,258 --> 01:06:41,453
-You like soul or groovy parties?
-Soul.

778
01:06:41,827 --> 01:06:43,590
That one didn't work either.

779
01:06:43,796 --> 01:06:47,129
The counter girl was just too foxy.
And she flirted with me.

780
01:06:47,333 --> 01:06:48,493
Will you call me?

781
01:06:49,735 --> 01:06:53,296
I couldn’t pull a gun on her,
she was too sweet.

782
01:06:53,506 --> 01:06:55,303
Yeah, I agree.

783
01:07:02,314 --> 01:07:05,283
Excuse me. I’m lost.
How do I get to Barra?

784
01:07:05,484 --> 01:07:06,473
-To Barra?
-Yes.

785
01:07:06,685 --> 01:07:09,483
I thought: "Tough luck
for this guy from Sao Paulo."

786
01:07:09,688 --> 01:07:12,714
-In fact, we were going there.
-You’re kidding.

787
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:17,295
-You’re a lifesaver.
-That’s right.

788
01:07:18,063 --> 01:07:21,464
Because no guy from Sao Paulo
could ever be cool.

789
01:07:28,941 --> 01:07:32,172
-The body’s over here.
-We found it, Chief.

790
01:07:32,378 --> 01:07:34,869
The forensic expert!

791
01:07:50,362 --> 01:07:52,455
-Not a pretty sight, eh?
-You said it.

792
01:07:52,665 --> 01:07:54,963
-What a great singer.
-You like him?

793
01:07:55,167 --> 01:08:00,503
-I love music. What about you?
-Tell me, do you also like pot?

794
01:08:03,809 --> 01:08:06,300
I can’t say I’ve never tried it.

795
01:08:06,512 --> 01:08:09,640
The devil recognizes his own.

796
01:08:11,717 --> 01:08:14,311
-Do you have papers?
-I think so.

797
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,954
I have some.

798
01:08:19,558 --> 01:08:22,322
I’d always been an ace
at rolling a joint.

799
01:08:22,528 --> 01:08:24,928
If I’d had the same skill
with girls...

800
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:29,895
I’d never have lost so many chances
to lose my virginity.

801
01:08:32,004 --> 01:08:36,771
-For a Sao Paulo guy you’re very cool.
-Thanks, bro.

802
01:08:36,976 --> 01:08:39,877
What did they use?

803
01:08:40,246 --> 01:08:44,273
A club or a rock.
And the child?

804
01:08:44,483 --> 01:08:47,418
-Untouched.
-Thank goodness.

805
01:08:47,886 --> 01:08:52,380
-How long ago?
-About four hours.

806
01:08:52,925 --> 01:08:55,587
-Can we take it away?
-Go ahead.

807
01:08:56,962 --> 01:09:00,898
The murderer has to be
from the City of God.

808
01:09:19,685 --> 01:09:24,213
You bastard!
You motherfucker!

809
01:09:24,923 --> 01:09:27,858
Did you have to kill
your chick in the ghetto?

810
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:31,052
-The place is crawling with cops now!
-Come on, Li’l Z'.

811
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:35,723
-Come on? Fuck you!
-I had to avenge my honor.

812
01:09:35,934 --> 01:09:39,426
Her family’s turned me in.
You won’t have any problems.

813
01:09:39,638 --> 01:09:43,130
The cops are everywhere because
of you. You’re dead meat, asshole.

814
01:09:43,342 --> 01:09:46,209
Let up, Li’l Z’.
You’ve punished him enough.

815
01:09:46,412 --> 01:09:48,539
You know the law.

816
01:09:48,747 --> 01:09:51,409
Anyone who kills in my ghetto
has to die as an example.

817
01:09:51,617 --> 01:09:54,211
That was his business, Li’l Z’.

818
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:57,014
Listen, you sonofabitch,
get outta the ghetto.

819
01:09:57,222 --> 01:09:59,315
You showed no respect, understand?

820
01:10:02,861 --> 01:10:04,158
You know what, Benny?

821
01:10:04,363 --> 01:10:07,924
You’re too nice. If you raise
a snake, expect to get bitten.

822
01:10:08,133 --> 01:10:11,000
He wasn’t worth shit.

823
01:10:11,403 --> 01:10:14,201
-A dirty traitor.
-Shut up, Tuba.

824
01:10:14,406 --> 01:10:16,772
I’m going for a walk
with my girl.

825
01:10:16,975 --> 01:10:22,140
Okay, be careful.
When things calm down...

826
01:10:22,348 --> 01:10:25,374
we’ll get back to our business
with Carrot, okay?

827
01:10:30,322 --> 01:10:33,382
You need a girlfriend, Li’l Z’.

828
01:10:53,711 --> 01:10:55,941
Know what I’m thinking, Benny?

829
01:10:56,581 --> 01:10:59,072
That I’m so sexy?

830
01:10:59,284 --> 01:11:02,845
That too. But I mean,
you know what we could do?

831
01:11:03,054 --> 01:11:06,546
-Make love again.
-I’m serious.

832
01:11:07,191 --> 01:11:11,855
We could go away from here.
This violence sucks.

833
01:11:13,097 --> 01:11:14,462
Go where?

834
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:17,200
To a farm.

835
01:11:18,903 --> 01:11:22,771
We’re really hippies at heart,
aren’t we?

836
01:11:24,175 --> 01:11:26,302
A farm?

837
01:11:29,681 --> 01:11:32,241
Peace and love?

838
01:11:52,103 --> 01:11:56,836
BENNY’S FAREWELL

839
01:12:05,516 --> 01:12:08,815
Benny was just too cool
to go on being a hoodlum.

840
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:12,649
He succeeded in getting everybody
together for his good-bye party.

841
01:12:12,857 --> 01:12:14,154
The gangs...

842
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:17,819
The soul crowd...

843
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:27,766
-The religious crowd...
-One day, I’ll go to church.

844
01:12:27,972 --> 01:12:29,906
The samba crowd...

845
01:12:33,578 --> 01:12:35,773
The groovy crowd...

846
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:42,576
And Li’l Z', who had never
danced in his life.

847
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:06,467
Want to dance with me?
Want to dance with me?

848
01:13:06,677 --> 01:13:09,077
-I didn’t hear...
-Want to dance?

849
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:12,374
No, thank you, I’m with someone.

850
01:13:26,998 --> 01:13:28,625
Hey, Rocket!

851
01:13:42,547 --> 01:13:45,983
Come, I want to talk
to you, buddy.

852
01:13:46,951 --> 01:13:50,011
-You can’t just split with that chick.
-Why not?

853
01:13:50,221 --> 01:13:54,419
I'm gonna go live on a farm,
smoke pot, listen to rock.

854
01:13:54,625 --> 01:13:58,425
You wanna throw away everything
we've accomplished for that bitch?

855
01:13:59,063 --> 01:14:02,123
She's not a bitch, she's my girl.

856
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:04,927
We’ll take over Carrot’s business,
it’ll be yours.

857
01:14:05,136 --> 01:14:08,469
-Leave Carrot alone, he’s a good guy.
-He’s a motherfucker!

858
01:14:08,673 --> 01:14:11,972
See? Everyone’s a motherfucker
to you. That’s why I’m leaving.

859
01:14:12,176 --> 01:14:15,873
I’m your friend,
but I’m getting out.

860
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,310
You got to understand,
I have to go.

861
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:23,887
I love you, man,
but I’ve had enough.

862
01:15:23,114 --> 01:15:25,480
Motherfucker, let’s see
if you have any balls.

863
01:15:25,683 --> 01:15:29,278
-What is this?
-You wanna die? Fuck off, bitch!

864
01:15:29,854 --> 01:15:33,017
Strip, nigger.
I wanna see your ass.

865
01:15:33,224 --> 01:15:37,593
Hurry up!
Take it all off! Now!

866
01:15:38,329 --> 01:15:41,355
I wanna see your ass.
Come on, faggot!

867
01:15:41,766 --> 01:15:44,360
Let’s go, nigger!

868
01:15:54,345 --> 01:15:57,314
Show your ass to everyone!

869
01:15:57,915 --> 01:15:59,542
Please...

870
01:16:04,589 --> 01:16:07,149
-Strip, dammit!
-Hurry it up!

871
01:16:18,936 --> 01:16:22,303
What’s up, Benny?
This camera for a bag of coke?

872
01:16:22,506 --> 01:16:27,136
-I don’t deal anymore.
-C’mon, do it for me. You’re my friend.

873
01:16:27,345 --> 01:16:30,007
-Is it stolen?
-It’s okay, it’s my dad’s.

874
01:16:30,748 --> 01:16:32,739
Your dad’s?

875
01:16:33,818 --> 01:16:39,051
-Give it to Li’l Z’.
-Rocket would love this camera.

876
01:16:43,194 --> 01:16:44,923
-Yeah, here.
-Great.

877
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:11,786
Here I am!

878
01:17:11,989 --> 01:17:14,116
-You wanna be a photographer?
-Yeah.

879
01:17:14,525 --> 01:17:19,326
-Here’s a present.
-Shit, dude! This is great!

880
01:17:20,097 --> 01:17:24,295
Now move your ass.
Shake it!

881
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,346
You’ll take some great pictures.

882
01:17:48,225 --> 01:17:50,193
Give me that.

883
01:17:55,433 --> 01:18:01,668
-Give me back the camera!
-No!

884
01:18:04,608 --> 01:18:11,275
What’s your problem?
Are you crazy?

885
01:18:38,476 --> 01:18:42,037
They’ve killed Benny!

886
01:18:43,647 --> 01:18:48,584
Fuck! Call an ambulance!
Where’s the motherfucker who did it?

887
01:18:49,386 --> 01:18:54,414
-Z’, Benny is dead.
-No! Call a doctor!

888
01:18:59,964 --> 01:19:04,560
Get out of here, bitch!
It’s your fault!

889
01:19:06,837 --> 01:19:08,964
Motherfucker!

890
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:35,464
Where's Carrot?

891
01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:37,327
Blacky's here.

892
01:19:39,737 --> 01:19:42,297
He's in trouble.

893
01:19:44,375 --> 01:19:46,104
I’m fucked.

894
01:19:46,577 --> 01:19:48,568
-Why?
-I’m fucked.

895
01:19:48,779 --> 01:19:51,646
And you are too.
I think I killed Benny.

896
01:19:51,849 --> 01:19:53,976
Li’l Z’ is coming
to take your place.

897
01:19:54,185 --> 01:19:56,449
We can get him,
he's in the dance hall.

898
01:19:56,654 --> 01:19:58,281
You killed Benny?

899
01:19:58,489 --> 01:20:02,016
I didn’t mean to. He moved.
I was aiming at Li’l Z’.

900
01:20:02,226 --> 01:20:04,387
Come on, let’s go.

901
01:20:04,595 --> 01:20:07,086
Blacky...

902
01:20:07,298 --> 01:20:09,926
You killed the coolest
hood in the City of God.

903
01:20:10,134 --> 01:20:12,398
Let’s go get Li’l Z’.

904
01:20:20,377 --> 01:20:25,041
Carrot knew that without Benny only
a miracle could save his business.

905
01:20:25,249 --> 01:20:28,343
We’re fucked, man.

906
01:20:37,928 --> 01:20:43,230
But what better place for a miracle to
happen than in the City of God?

907
01:20:46,871 --> 01:20:48,771
Look who’s here.
My sugar babe.

908
01:20:48,973 --> 01:20:50,634
-Let me by.
-Gimme a kiss, girl.

909
01:20:50,841 --> 01:20:54,800
Let me by, please.
Have you seen what you look like?

910
01:20:56,847 --> 01:20:59,907
Come on, Li’l Z’.

911
01:21:08,392 --> 01:21:10,883
Hi, honey.
Everything okay, baby?

912
01:21:18,535 --> 01:21:25,202
The problem was simple. Li’l Z' was
ugly. Knockout Ned was handsome.

913
01:21:25,409 --> 01:21:31,473
Knockout Ned could get any girl.
Li’l Z' had to pay or use force.

914
01:21:32,149 --> 01:21:35,744
It was a duel between
the handsome good guy...

915
01:21:36,253 --> 01:21:38,118
and the ugly bad guy.

916
01:21:38,322 --> 01:21:40,882
-Let me go!
-Just enjoy it.

917
01:21:48,198 --> 01:21:53,659
There’s no use fighting.
You’re mine now.

918
01:21:57,908 --> 01:22:01,105
Hey, faggot, your broad’s
really hot!

919
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:35,708
I can’t even look her in
the face now.

920
01:22:45,756 --> 01:22:49,192
Why didn’t that fucker kill me?

921
01:22:53,297 --> 01:22:57,393
Hold on...
Why didn't I kill that fucker?

922
01:22:57,901 --> 01:22:59,766
Let’s go back.

923
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:02,768
-What about Carrot?
-We’ll get back to him.

924
01:23:02,973 --> 01:23:04,201
You gonna kill him?

925
01:23:07,911 --> 01:23:11,972
Knockout Ned, your chick’s a slut.
Come out, motherfucker!

926
01:23:12,182 --> 01:23:17,620
-Come out, you loser!
-Take it easy...

927
01:23:17,821 --> 01:23:21,951
I’m going out. Let me go.

928
01:23:35,406 --> 01:23:37,431
Gerson! Come back, son!

929
01:23:47,985 --> 01:23:51,853
This doesn’t concern you, kid.
We’re here for your brother.

930
01:23:52,056 --> 01:23:55,423
Let’s talk, we can work it out.
My brother’s a peaceful guy.

931
01:23:55,626 --> 01:23:58,823
Is he too good-looking
to come talk to me? Call him.

932
01:23:59,029 --> 01:24:00,291
He hasn't done anything.

933
01:24:00,864 --> 01:24:04,163
You know who I am?

934
01:24:04,368 --> 01:24:07,428
-Li’l Z’, man.
-He’s Li’l Z’.

935
01:24:08,038 --> 01:24:10,905
Call that motherfucker!

936
01:24:15,579 --> 01:24:18,446
Go on, man.

937
01:24:18,982 --> 01:24:21,246
Calm down, I’ll call him.

938
01:24:54,852 --> 01:24:58,253
My arm! I hurt my arm.
Carrot will have to wait.

939
01:24:58,455 --> 01:25:00,787
That loser got what he deserved.

940
01:25:00,991 --> 01:25:02,982
Let’s go!

941
01:25:26,717 --> 01:25:30,653
Gerson...

942
01:25:30,854 --> 01:25:34,449
That bastard killed my brother.

943
01:25:42,399 --> 01:25:45,163
I can’t let that go.

944
01:26:00,384 --> 01:26:02,511
-Want a gun?
-My son...

945
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:06,120
Calm down, mom.

946
01:26:06,957 --> 01:26:09,824
Please, mom...

947
01:26:18,635 --> 01:26:22,298
Do it right, asshole.

948
01:26:22,506 --> 01:26:26,237
-There’s no other way.
-How’d I let that loser hit me?

949
01:26:26,443 --> 01:26:28,911
Shit, that’s some hole.

950
01:26:58,642 --> 01:27:01,634
-It’s as if we were brothers.
-Shut up.

951
01:27:01,845 --> 01:27:06,373
Both of us hurt in the arm.
You by one brother, me the other.

952
01:27:06,583 --> 01:27:10,383
It would be really funny
if we were brothers.

953
01:27:10,587 --> 01:27:16,685
That Knockout Ned's not bad, eh?
He came out of nowhere.

954
01:27:17,461 --> 01:27:21,090
Shut up, Tuba!
You're a fucking pain!

955
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:32,803
It was as if the City of God
had suddenly found a hero.

956
01:27:33,010 --> 01:27:35,171
God bless you, son.

957
01:27:35,379 --> 01:27:38,644
That kid was just asking
to be killed.

958
01:27:38,849 --> 01:27:41,545
Well done.

959
01:27:41,752 --> 01:27:44,983
You did a good job.

960
01:27:45,188 --> 01:27:48,817
You’d better go hide.

961
01:27:51,428 --> 01:27:54,693
I thought Knockout Ned
would start a revolution here.

962
01:27:54,898 --> 01:27:57,662
But God had other plans.

963
01:27:57,968 --> 01:28:01,563
Steak,
where are all the dealers?

964
01:28:01,772 --> 01:28:05,037
They’re hiding.
Li’l Z’ is in a bad mood.

965
01:28:05,242 --> 01:28:08,973
They get us hooked and then
they go off and hide.

966
01:28:09,179 --> 01:28:12,410
Do me a favor. Go get some
nose candy for me.

967
01:28:12,616 --> 01:28:14,015
I’ll try.

968
01:28:14,217 --> 01:28:17,675
Tell them it’s for Thiago,
to keep my buzz going.

969
01:28:38,274 --> 01:28:43,644
Steak’n’fries,
go to Carrot’s and tell him...

970
01:28:43,846 --> 01:28:49,216
Li’l Z' says that if you kill
Knockout, he’ll leave you alone.

971
01:28:49,852 --> 01:28:52,719
Hey, Knockout Ned.
Did you hear that?

972
01:28:52,922 --> 01:28:55,584
Grab the kid!

973
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:03,426
You heard the boy? If you don't
stick with us, you're dead.

974
01:29:03,633 --> 01:29:06,898
I think you should join us.
We'll be partners.

975
01:29:07,570 --> 01:29:10,505
Drugs aren't my thing.

976
01:29:10,707 --> 01:29:12,834
This is just something
between me and him.

977
01:29:13,042 --> 01:29:17,706
Those guys aren’t worth shit.

978
01:29:17,914 --> 01:29:21,509
They'll do anything for power.

979
01:29:21,718 --> 01:29:24,050
Like that kid.

980
01:29:24,253 --> 01:29:28,383
They're all robots,
like this punk here.

981
01:29:28,591 --> 01:29:30,855
What’s in your head, kid?

982
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:33,494
Can't you see you're
wrecking your life...

983
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:37,928
with that maniac and a bunch
of trigger-happy fools?

984
01:29:39,402 --> 01:29:46,069
-Are you crazy? You’re just a kid.
-A kid? I smoke, snort...

985
01:29:46,275 --> 01:29:49,574
I’ve killed and robbed.
I’m a man.

986
01:29:49,779 --> 01:29:52,304
Shit, you have no idea!

987
01:29:52,515 --> 01:29:55,746
He’s attached to his gang.
You should join up with us.

988
01:29:55,952 --> 01:30:00,821
-Shall we kill him?
-Steak, we're going to grind you.

989
01:30:02,425 --> 01:30:06,657
-Okay, I accept.
-Great!

990
01:30:06,863 --> 01:30:10,959
Tell your boss that Knockout Ned
and Carrot are now in command.

991
01:30:11,167 --> 01:30:17,367
But on one condition:
no killing of innocent people.

992
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:21,602
I can't accept that, understand?

993
01:30:21,811 --> 01:30:26,475
Okay, no innocent people.

994
01:30:27,884 --> 01:30:32,821
Steak fucked up!

995
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:47,094
-Have you a gun for me?
-No...

996
01:30:47,303 --> 01:30:50,704
but we can hold up
a gun store.

997
01:30:50,907 --> 01:30:52,966
That’s no problem.

998
01:30:53,176 --> 01:30:56,771
I don’t want to hold up anything.
I’m not a hoodlum.

999
01:30:56,979 --> 01:31:00,176
This is a personal affair
between me and him, okay?

1000
01:31:00,850 --> 01:31:03,114
I’m not a hoodlum.

1001
01:31:05,488 --> 01:31:07,456
He raped your chick...

1002
01:31:07,657 --> 01:31:11,491
killed your uncle and brother,
gunned your house...

1003
01:31:11,694 --> 01:31:15,061
and you killed one of his guys.

1004
01:31:19,401 --> 01:31:23,030
If you’re not a hood,
then get out.

1005
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:32,547
THE STORY OF KNOCKOUT NED

1006
01:31:33,715 --> 01:31:36,206
This is a hold-up!

1007
01:31:44,259 --> 01:31:47,888
-The first time...
-Where are the revolvers?

1008
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:51,725
...Knockout Ned saved a salesclerk
from being shot by Carrot.

1009
01:31:51,933 --> 01:31:56,336
We said no killing!

1010
01:31:56,538 --> 01:31:58,335
That’s the rule.

1011
01:31:59,574 --> 01:32:04,807
We want the boss’ money. Everyone
keep calm. Open the cash register!

1012
01:32:05,013 --> 01:32:07,914
You want us to go?
We do too.

1013
01:32:08,116 --> 01:32:10,550
So hurry up!

1014
01:32:11,787 --> 01:32:14,187
-Look at the ground!
-The second time...

1015
01:32:14,389 --> 01:32:16,323
Carrot saved
Knockout Ned's life.

1016
01:32:19,094 --> 01:32:22,222
Ned learned that there's
an exception to every rule.

1017
01:32:22,864 --> 01:32:25,196
Exception to the rule.

1018
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:28,494
-Are you the manager?
-Yes.

1019
01:32:28,703 --> 01:32:32,696
This is a hold-up.
Everyone on the ground!

1020
01:32:32,908 --> 01:32:34,933
On the ground!

1021
01:32:35,143 --> 01:32:39,375
Give me the money!

1022
01:32:42,317 --> 01:32:44,547
I’m not kidding.

1023
01:32:44,753 --> 01:32:46,983
The first person who moves
is dead!

1024
01:32:47,389 --> 01:32:51,018
The third time, the exception
becomes the rule.

1025
01:33:06,808 --> 01:33:11,177
Carrot and Knockout Ned
prepared to face Li’l Z'.

1026
01:33:11,379 --> 01:33:14,177
Carrot could protect his
business.

1027
01:33:14,449 --> 01:33:16,212
Knockout Ned...

1028
01:33:16,418 --> 01:33:19,353
the best marksman in his battalion,
wanted revenge.

1029
01:33:19,554 --> 01:33:23,752
First, the Italians.
This is a 9 mm.

1030
01:33:24,493 --> 01:33:26,723
-Let me see.
-Not bad, eh?

1031
01:33:26,928 --> 01:33:31,627
-The sight isn’t well-aligned.
-I’ll give you a good price.

1032
01:33:32,434 --> 01:33:34,425
The 12 mm, the "hand job".

1033
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:36,298
See why?

1034
01:33:36,505 --> 01:33:39,565
An Uzi, 9 mm. It’s Israeli.

1035
01:33:39,774 --> 01:33:42,641
-The star of David.
-Jewish.

1036
01:33:42,844 --> 01:33:44,209
I want a 30-06.

1037
01:33:44,679 --> 01:33:47,045
Now we can start having fun.

1038
01:33:47,249 --> 01:33:51,583
The war’s on.
Let’s start with a prayer.

1039
01:33:51,953 --> 01:33:56,049
Our Father who art in heaven
hallowed be our name...

1040
01:33:56,258 --> 01:34:00,422
Our will be done...

1041
01:34:00,962 --> 01:34:03,453
On earth as it is in heaven...

1042
01:34:16,711 --> 01:34:18,770
Hoodlums have guns,
but can't shoot.

1043
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:23,107
One bullet from Knockout Ned
was worth ten from Li’l Z”s gang.

1044
01:34:23,318 --> 01:34:27,448
Li’l Z' couldn't take it.
He counter-attacked.

1045
01:34:30,091 --> 01:34:34,323
The ghetto had been a purgatory,
now it was hell.

1046
01:34:38,266 --> 01:34:43,966
I decided to get out.
That's how I became a reporter.

1047
01:34:44,839 --> 01:34:47,273
Great photo!

1048
01:34:47,475 --> 01:34:49,943
I bet it’s by Rogerio Reis.

1049
01:34:50,512 --> 01:34:53,345
What did I tell you?

1050
01:34:53,548 --> 01:34:55,743
Like any pro...

1051
01:34:55,951 --> 01:34:59,387
I started at the bottom,
way down at the bottom.

1052
01:34:59,588 --> 01:35:03,046
Without knowing what awaited me.

1053
01:35:04,693 --> 01:35:07,662
Instead of going home
I’d go over to the paper.

1054
01:35:07,862 --> 01:35:11,229
A guy from the City of God
worked in the lab.

1055
01:35:11,433 --> 01:35:14,300
Check this out.

1056
01:35:14,502 --> 01:35:18,563
He helped me move closer to
what I loved most in life.

1057
01:35:18,773 --> 01:35:20,400
-Hi, Rogerio.
-How are you, Pierre?

1058
01:35:20,609 --> 01:35:23,237
This is Rocket.
He’s a photographer.

1059
01:35:23,445 --> 01:35:24,605
Hello, Rocket.

1060
01:35:24,813 --> 01:35:27,077
-He’s a fan of yours.
-Really?

1061
01:35:27,282 --> 01:35:28,909
You have good taste, Rocket!

1062
01:35:29,117 --> 01:35:32,211
-Well, I’m done. I’m off.
-See you.

1063
01:35:32,420 --> 01:35:35,082
What a cool guy!

1064
01:35:35,890 --> 01:35:38,984
What should have been
a swift revenge...

1065
01:35:39,194 --> 01:35:41,685
turned into an all-out war.

1066
01:35:46,801 --> 01:35:49,031
The City of God was divided.

1067
01:35:49,237 --> 01:35:53,037
You couldn't go from one
section to the other.

1068
01:35:53,241 --> 01:35:55,471
Not even to visit a relative.

1069
01:35:55,677 --> 01:35:59,408
The cops considered anyone
living in the ghetto a hoodlum.

1070
01:35:59,614 --> 01:36:03,050
People got used to living
in Vietnam.

1071
01:36:07,255 --> 01:36:12,215
And more and more volunteers
kept signing up to die.

1072
01:36:12,427 --> 01:36:13,416
This kid...

1073
01:36:13,628 --> 01:36:16,358
-What do you want?
-A boy from Carrot’s gang punched me.

1074
01:36:16,898 --> 01:36:18,263
The war was
an excuse for everything.

1075
01:36:18,667 --> 01:36:20,635
One of Li’l Z”s soldiers
kicked me.

1076
01:36:22,671 --> 01:36:24,696
Take this.22.

1077
01:36:26,508 --> 01:36:28,976
The jerk who raped my sister is
with Carrot.

1078
01:36:29,177 --> 01:36:30,576
Li’l Z’ evicted my family.

1079
01:36:31,613 --> 01:36:33,240
Kill... Be respected.

1080
01:36:45,627 --> 01:36:51,088
-I’m Thiago, a friend of Benny’s.
-Can you read? Can you add?

1081
01:36:51,299 --> 01:36:56,737
-I’m pretty good in business.
-Okay, get to work.

1082
01:36:57,238 --> 01:37:00,605
-What do you want?
-To get my father’s murderer.

1083
01:37:01,009 --> 01:37:03,773
-What’s your name?
-My name’s Otto.

1084
01:37:09,217 --> 01:37:11,185
What’s the matter?

1085
01:37:11,386 --> 01:37:15,345
-He’s a worker.
-But he wants a gun.

1086
01:37:16,091 --> 01:37:18,753
He won’t last a week.

1087
01:37:29,771 --> 01:37:34,606
A year later, no one
remembered how it had all begun.

1088
01:37:34,809 --> 01:37:36,140
Take that!

1089
01:37:38,947 --> 01:37:44,886
For both sides, the aim was to take
over the enemy's business in order...

1090
01:37:45,086 --> 01:37:48,613
to buy more guns and take over
more businesses.

1091
01:38:10,445 --> 01:38:13,642
I smoke, snort,
I’ve killed and robbed.

1092
01:38:13,848 --> 01:38:16,180
I’m a man.

1093
01:38:37,839 --> 01:38:42,867
The media started taking an interest.
The police had to intervene.

1094
01:38:56,825 --> 01:39:01,228
A gang leader, from the City of God,
was arrested today.

1095
01:39:01,429 --> 01:39:03,158
Manuel Machado,
a.k.a. Knockout Ned...

1096
01:39:03,364 --> 01:39:06,765
was hospitalized after being
wounded by Li’l Z”s gang.

1097
01:39:06,968 --> 01:39:09,198
Our reporter interviewed him.

1098
01:39:09,404 --> 01:39:13,363
-Is the war still going on?
-It's still going on.

1099
01:39:13,641 --> 01:39:18,169
-Have many people died?
-Many have died.

1100
01:39:18,379 --> 01:39:20,506
Mostly innocent people.

1101
01:39:20,715 --> 01:39:24,082
Just knowing me is enough...

1102
01:39:24,285 --> 01:39:29,018
to get you killed by Li’l Z'.

1103
01:39:29,224 --> 01:39:32,591
-The police don’t go in there?
-They go after me, not him.

1104
01:39:32,794 --> 01:39:39,131
I’ve been in jail, while he goes
on killing undisturbed.

1105
01:39:39,334 --> 01:39:41,427
And they don’t arrest him.

1106
01:39:41,636 --> 01:39:43,934
Knockout Ned says
the war will continue.

1107
01:39:44,138 --> 01:39:49,735
Police Chief Guedes has promised
to arrest both of the gangs.

1108
01:39:58,219 --> 01:39:59,948
Motherfucker!

1109
01:40:00,154 --> 01:40:03,715
I’m the boss here, but he gets
his picture in the paper!

1110
01:40:03,925 --> 01:40:07,486
-Have you found mine?
-Just Knockout Ned’s.

1111
01:40:07,695 --> 01:40:09,162
Keep looking.

1112
01:40:09,564 --> 01:40:12,294
At least my name’s
got to be in there.

1113
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:14,195
-There’s nothing.
-Can you read?

1114
01:40:14,402 --> 01:40:16,836
Just the pictures.

1115
01:40:17,805 --> 01:40:19,864
Nothing.

1116
01:40:20,074 --> 01:40:23,168
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

1117
01:40:23,378 --> 01:40:28,509
-It’s just the want ads.
-I don’t care, read everything!

1118
01:40:28,716 --> 01:40:32,880
-But there aren’t any articles.
-Want a bullet in your head?

1119
01:40:34,889 --> 01:40:38,381
Gotta show them who’s boss here.

1120
01:40:43,431 --> 01:40:47,128
-Give me the camera!
-No way!

1121
01:40:49,671 --> 01:40:52,003
Take my picture, man.

1122
01:40:52,607 --> 01:40:55,337
I can’t work it.

1123
01:40:55,543 --> 01:40:57,238
Go ahead.

1124
01:40:57,612 --> 01:41:02,174
-I’ll hold the Beretta.
-Let me try...

1125
01:41:02,817 --> 01:41:05,513
Back off...

1126
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:09,986
-There’s no click.
-What a bunch of bozos!

1127
01:41:10,491 --> 01:41:13,255
I’m fucked with you guys.

1128
01:41:15,330 --> 01:41:17,890
I have an idea.

1129
01:41:18,099 --> 01:41:22,627
I’ll go get a guy I know.
Hang loose.

1130
01:41:23,504 --> 01:41:27,406
-Here he is.
-Take the camera.

1131
01:41:28,109 --> 01:41:30,543
Well, kid?

1132
01:41:31,612 --> 01:41:37,016
Aren’t you a photographer?
Make the camerawork. We can’t do it.

1133
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:40,617
Take our picture.

1134
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:49,360
-You fucking broke it.
-It wasn’t me.

1135
01:41:49,931 --> 01:41:51,626
I found it.

1136
01:41:53,468 --> 01:41:55,629
It has to be wound.

1137
01:42:00,074 --> 01:42:03,066
-What’s your name?
-Rocket.

1138
01:42:03,444 --> 01:42:07,380
-Another picture, Rocket.
-How about two rows?

1139
01:42:07,582 --> 01:42:12,485
-What?
-Two rows. Everyone with their guns.

1140
01:42:13,254 --> 01:42:17,281
-You’re outside, for Christ’s sake!
-Talk to him nicely, kid.

1141
01:42:17,492 --> 01:42:19,426
Sorry. Move in, please.

1142
01:42:21,929 --> 01:42:24,397
Another one.

1143
01:42:28,770 --> 01:42:31,068
-I think the roll’s finished.
-Then show us the pictures.

1144
01:42:31,272 --> 01:42:34,139
-They have to be developed.
-Developed?

1145
01:42:35,376 --> 01:42:37,037
How much is it?

1146
01:42:37,645 --> 01:42:42,048
Take this money.
And bring back the pictures.

1147
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:47,517
-I have to remove the film.
-Keep the camera.

1148
01:42:48,022 --> 01:42:52,425
Benny wanted to give it to you,
didn’t he? So, it’s yours...

1149
01:42:52,627 --> 01:42:54,458
Thanks.

1150
01:42:56,397 --> 01:43:00,595
Don’t forget the pictures.
The photos, Rocket!

1151
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:14,011
-Pierre!
-What?

1152
01:43:14,415 --> 01:43:17,782
Can you develop this for me?

1153
01:43:18,486 --> 01:43:21,944
I can’t, Rocket.
I could get into trouble.

1154
01:43:22,156 --> 01:43:24,886
It’s only for the paper’s reporters.
I could risk my job.

1155
01:43:25,093 --> 01:43:26,583
-Pierre?
-Yes, Rogerio?

1156
01:43:26,794 --> 01:43:31,424
Develop these for me.
This one too, okay?

1157
01:43:31,833 --> 01:43:34,199
I’m going to lunch.

1158
01:43:34,402 --> 01:43:38,498
You’re lucky. What size?

1159
01:43:38,706 --> 01:43:42,107
-What?
-For the enlargement, what size?

1160
01:43:42,577 --> 01:43:46,377
Well... Whatever you think is best.

1161
01:44:06,167 --> 01:44:08,294
-Here.
-Thanks.

1162
01:44:12,173 --> 01:44:14,835
I’m in deep shit now.

1163
01:44:16,744 --> 01:44:19,269
I’m as good as dead.

1164
01:44:30,525 --> 01:44:32,618
Someone had signed
my death sentence.

1165
01:44:32,827 --> 01:44:36,285
I wanted to bash the jerk's face in.

1166
01:44:41,969 --> 01:44:45,598
Are you Marina?
Because of you I’m dead.

1167
01:44:45,806 --> 01:44:47,933
You stole my photos.

1168
01:44:48,142 --> 01:44:52,010
Dead? Stole? What do you mean?
Not so loud.

1169
01:44:53,314 --> 01:44:55,839
Not so loud?
I’ll be killed because of you.

1170
01:44:56,050 --> 01:44:58,610
You were gone,
your photos were in the lab.

1171
01:44:58,819 --> 01:45:01,652
There's nothing I can do.
The photos in our lab...

1172
01:45:01,856 --> 01:45:04,654
are photos to be published
in the paper.

1173
01:45:04,859 --> 01:45:08,124
I saw the photos,
I published them.

1174
01:45:08,329 --> 01:45:10,729
-You stole them.
-I did not. Here they are.

1175
01:45:10,932 --> 01:45:15,301
-Give them to me.
-Just a second.

1176
01:45:15,503 --> 01:45:18,631
Here are your photos.

1177
01:45:18,839 --> 01:45:22,605
-Are there any others?
-Calm down. What’s your name?

1178
01:45:23,044 --> 01:45:26,104
-Rocket.
-Rocket?

1179
01:45:26,814 --> 01:45:29,214
Nice to meet you.
I’m Marina.

1180
01:45:29,417 --> 01:45:34,912
Now, relax. I have money for you.
For your pictures.

1181
01:45:35,323 --> 01:45:40,351
Here, when we use a picture
we pay the photographer.

1182
01:45:40,561 --> 01:45:43,587
-Do you want to be a photographer?
-Yes.

1183
01:45:43,798 --> 01:45:47,666
-Great start! On the front page.
-How’d you get these photos?

1184
01:45:47,868 --> 01:45:49,426
-I live there.
-Rocket...

1185
01:45:49,971 --> 01:45:53,873
no photographer has ever been able
to go in there.

1186
01:45:55,343 --> 01:45:59,973
If you could bring us
more pictures of Li’l Z’...

1187
01:46:00,181 --> 01:46:05,209
the paper would buy them.
We’d pay you.

1188
01:46:05,419 --> 01:46:07,478
Could you?

1189
01:46:07,688 --> 01:46:09,553
I don’t know.

1190
01:46:09,857 --> 01:46:11,222
What’s the problem?

1191
01:46:11,425 --> 01:46:14,258
The problem? I can’t go there
anymore at night.

1192
01:46:14,462 --> 01:46:18,728
-And during the day?
-It’s too risky.

1193
01:46:20,334 --> 01:46:25,863
Look, man! They’ve finally
understood that I’m the boss.

1194
01:46:27,508 --> 01:46:29,305
What’s your
photographer-friend’s name?

1195
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:30,738
Rocket.

1196
01:46:30,945 --> 01:46:34,142
He’s good. I’ll take more
to show the others.

1197
01:46:37,318 --> 01:46:40,583
So, Rocket, is it yes or no?

1198
01:46:42,857 --> 01:46:45,826
It’s a great opportunity.

1199
01:46:47,762 --> 01:46:49,161
Okay.

1200
01:46:50,398 --> 01:46:54,994
-You made the right choice. Very good!
-I’ll give you some film, lenses...

1201
01:46:55,202 --> 01:47:00,902
and even another camera.
I’ll show you the equipment room.

1202
01:47:01,108 --> 01:47:04,373
There’s another problem.

1203
01:47:04,578 --> 01:47:07,604
-What is it?
-Where can I sleep tonight?

1204
01:47:08,382 --> 01:47:11,044
I can’t go back now.

1205
01:47:13,888 --> 01:47:18,382
This is a 135 mm.
Will you be close up or far away?

1206
01:47:18,592 --> 01:47:19,581
Far away.

1207
01:47:20,061 --> 01:47:22,586
-Can you measure the light?
-Yes.

1208
01:47:24,699 --> 01:47:27,497
Aren’t you too close?

1209
01:47:29,670 --> 01:47:33,538
I don’t know what spurred me
to go talk to them like that.

1210
01:47:33,741 --> 01:47:35,936
Maybe I was going to die...

1211
01:47:36,143 --> 01:47:39,544
but now I had a camera...

1212
01:47:39,747 --> 01:47:42,443
and a chance to become
a photographer.

1213
01:47:43,017 --> 01:47:45,417
Watch out for the dog shit.

1214
01:47:45,853 --> 01:47:49,084
Not to mention that
the night was still young...

1215
01:47:49,290 --> 01:47:52,657
-Want something to eat?
-No thank you, ma'am.

1216
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:58,560
Nothing to eat? Nothing to drink?
A joint?

1217
01:47:59,834 --> 01:48:01,597
Try this...

1218
01:48:20,388 --> 01:48:22,515
It’s time to go to sleep.

1219
01:48:24,558 --> 01:48:27,891
I’ll show you your bed.

1220
01:48:28,095 --> 01:48:31,121
-You have hot water, don’t you?
-Yes.

1221
01:48:31,332 --> 01:48:33,823
You’ve never taken a hot shower?

1222
01:48:34,034 --> 01:48:36,264
-No.
-What do you do?

1223
01:48:36,470 --> 01:48:39,701
We heat up the kettle.

1224
01:48:39,907 --> 01:48:43,775
-Why are you standing there?
-What room do I sleep in?

1225
01:48:43,978 --> 01:48:50,110
Unfortunately, there’s only one room.
You have to sleep with me.

1226
01:48:50,317 --> 01:48:53,980
I won’t go into the details
of my first sexual experience.

1227
01:48:54,188 --> 01:48:57,282
Just relax...

1228
01:48:57,892 --> 01:48:59,792
Because, elsewhere...

1229
01:48:59,994 --> 01:49:04,658
another more important sex scene
for the ghetto was taking place.

1230
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:08,398
Carrot was helping
Knockout Ned escape...

1231
01:49:08,602 --> 01:49:11,230
without firing a shot.

1232
01:49:12,673 --> 01:49:18,669
The policeman guarding him was
in the willing hands of the nurse.

1233
01:49:19,346 --> 01:49:20,438
And in the meantime...

1234
01:49:20,648 --> 01:49:24,049
to eliminate Carrot, Li’l Z'
was investing in munitions.

1235
01:49:24,251 --> 01:49:26,981
He invested heavily,
even if he couldn’t pay...

1236
01:49:28,287 --> 01:49:31,688
-Remember the double-barrel?
-I already have it.

1237
01:49:31,891 --> 01:49:36,658
This is a repeater rifle. You don’t have
this one, the Browning.

1238
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:39,956
-It’ll shoot down a plane.
-I’m not shooting down planes.

1239
01:49:40,166 --> 01:49:43,465
And the one I asked for?
The AR-15, Uncle Sam.

1240
01:49:44,236 --> 01:49:47,103
You can’t get them in Brazil.

1241
01:49:47,306 --> 01:49:49,297
My ass, Uncle Sam.

1242
01:49:52,244 --> 01:49:54,474
I have a solution.

1243
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:56,375
The Rugger. Ever seen one?

1244
01:49:56,582 --> 01:50:01,110
It’s like the AR-15.
Same caliber, but lighter.

1245
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:04,721
With an infrared sight?
400 shots a minute?

1246
01:50:04,924 --> 01:50:07,757
-It depends.
-It depends, my ass!

1247
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:10,520
Trying to fuck me over?

1248
01:50:10,863 --> 01:50:12,728
I’ll fuck you over first.

1249
01:50:12,932 --> 01:50:15,833
You leave now without the money
or the guns.

1250
01:50:16,902 --> 01:50:19,564
-What do I tell the boss?
-That’s your problem.

1251
01:50:19,772 --> 01:50:23,936
-You’ll think of something.
-You heard him, chubby? Get out.

1252
01:50:24,410 --> 01:50:27,675
Beat it, fatso.

1253
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:29,438
Li’l Z' had made a big mistake.

1254
01:50:29,649 --> 01:50:33,949
He should have known that behind
every salesman lies a supplier.

1255
01:50:34,153 --> 01:50:36,383
And they don't joke around.

1256
01:50:37,890 --> 01:50:40,450
Have you seen this?

1257
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:43,226
What do they need an AR-15 for?

1258
01:50:43,429 --> 01:50:46,398
These stories will push
the police to investigate.

1259
01:50:46,599 --> 01:50:48,863
They’ll nab you.
And me, along with you.

1260
01:50:49,068 --> 01:50:53,698
Think I’m going
to give you away?

1261
01:50:56,876 --> 01:50:59,470
Don’t worry,
I’ll take care of it.

1262
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:01,840
But don’t fuck up again.

1263
01:51:08,621 --> 01:51:10,782
Charlie!

1264
01:51:11,490 --> 01:51:13,390
Come here!

1265
01:51:13,592 --> 01:51:15,150
Listen...

1266
01:51:15,361 --> 01:51:18,057
you tell him...

1267
01:51:18,831 --> 01:51:22,961
Let’s go make that sleazy
little dealer pay up.

1268
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:36,708
Come here, kids!

1269
01:51:38,784 --> 01:51:42,311
-Do you like chicken?
-It depends.

1270
01:51:42,521 --> 01:51:45,922
We’ll eat some chicken
and have Carrot for dessert.

1271
01:51:46,125 --> 01:51:49,458
I have a present for you.

1272
01:51:51,530 --> 01:51:53,225
Here...

1273
01:51:55,067 --> 01:51:57,058
A big one for you.

1274
01:51:57,269 --> 01:51:59,294
Are you really giving us
these guns?

1275
01:51:59,505 --> 01:52:04,238
Yes, but I want you on my side,
against Carrot.

1276
01:52:04,443 --> 01:52:07,173
Then can we hold up
anyone we want?

1277
01:52:07,379 --> 01:52:10,075
Not in the ghetto.
Can you shoot?

1278
01:52:10,282 --> 01:52:12,079
-More or less.
-More or less?

1279
01:52:12,284 --> 01:52:17,745
Hey, you guys, come help
these kids.

1280
01:52:19,258 --> 01:52:21,249
I know. You do it like this.

1281
01:52:27,399 --> 01:52:29,799
THE BEGINNING OF THE END

1282
01:52:38,511 --> 01:52:39,500
Get that chicken!

1283
01:52:52,792 --> 01:52:53,986
C'mon, let’s go.

1284
01:52:54,193 --> 01:52:56,127
If Li’l Z' catches you,
he'll kill you.

1285
01:52:58,130 --> 01:53:00,997
Yeah, well, he's gotta
find me first.

1286
01:53:08,874 --> 01:53:12,139
Hey, kid! Get that chicken!

1287
01:53:14,780 --> 01:53:16,270
Shit! The cops!

1288
01:53:16,482 --> 01:53:18,541
Hell, don't fucking run off!

1289
01:53:18,751 --> 01:53:20,616
Give me that.

1290
01:53:31,864 --> 01:53:34,230
Hey, Melonhead! You fucking fag!

1291
01:53:34,433 --> 01:53:37,561
Get the hell out of here!

1292
01:53:37,770 --> 01:53:39,135
Coward!

1293
01:53:39,338 --> 01:53:41,363
Asshole!

1294
01:53:42,308 --> 01:53:45,243
Come on, let them kill each other.

1295
01:53:45,444 --> 01:53:48,174
They can fuck themselves.

1296
01:53:56,322 --> 01:53:58,813
Rocket! Take a picture of us!

1297
01:54:00,226 --> 01:54:02,524
What are you waiting for?

1298
01:54:24,116 --> 01:54:25,879
What’s happening?

1299
01:54:26,252 --> 01:54:27,651
Shit!

1300
01:54:40,733 --> 01:54:42,633
Let’s go!

1301
01:55:14,667 --> 01:55:17,329
Run! Run!

1302
01:55:17,536 --> 01:55:20,403
Watch out!

1303
01:55:20,606 --> 01:55:23,598
Kill one of these faggots!
Blast him!

1304
01:55:43,262 --> 01:55:45,696
Knockout Ned!

1305
01:55:59,478 --> 01:56:02,276
Take it easy. Don’t move.

1306
01:56:02,481 --> 01:56:04,210
It hurts, man.

1307
01:56:04,416 --> 01:56:06,976
Easy does it, kid.

1308
01:56:07,987 --> 01:56:10,649
Why did you join this fucking war?

1309
01:56:10,856 --> 01:56:13,586
Knockout Ned!
Li’l Z’ has been hit. Come on!

1310
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:17,952
Wait here, I’ll help you.
Just hold on.

1311
01:56:27,172 --> 01:56:31,472
-What's your name?
-My name's Otto.

1312
01:56:38,517 --> 01:56:41,509
I want to get my father’s murderer.

1313
01:57:06,111 --> 01:57:08,579
Knockout Ned! Li’l Z’ has been hit.
Come on!

1314
01:57:09,948 --> 01:57:14,282
I’ll help you.
Just hold on there.

1315
01:57:53,425 --> 01:57:56,758
The fucking cops!

1316
01:57:56,962 --> 01:57:58,395
On the ground!

1317
01:57:58,597 --> 01:58:00,497
-Hands over your head.
-Don't move!

1318
01:58:08,740 --> 01:58:15,043
-You’re the one I want.
-You’re finished, pal.

1319
01:58:15,247 --> 01:58:17,306
Handcuff him.

1320
01:58:34,299 --> 01:58:35,857
Rocket, where are you going?

1321
01:58:36,068 --> 01:58:38,536
I got something to clear up.

1322
01:59:09,935 --> 01:59:11,459
Okay, lovebirds?

1323
01:59:11,670 --> 01:59:15,367
Come on, Li’l Z',
let’s go settle our scores.

1324
01:59:16,208 --> 01:59:20,304
Not you. You’re a present
for the media.

1325
01:59:56,415 --> 01:59:57,848
Does it come to 10,000?

1326
01:59:58,050 --> 02:00:01,110
Almost. That’s all I have.

1327
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:04,687
-That’s all there was, Chief.
-We searched everywhere.

1328
02:00:04,890 --> 02:00:07,381
Let him go.

1329
02:00:11,797 --> 02:00:14,698
What about this ring?
Is it gold?

1330
02:00:14,900 --> 02:00:20,805
Fill it up. You’ll owe us
the rest.

1331
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:26,806
Fucking war!

1332
02:00:29,047 --> 02:00:31,607
Knockout Ned is dead
and I'm dead broke!

1333
02:00:31,817 --> 02:00:34,081
You're fucked, eh?

1334
02:00:34,286 --> 02:00:35,548
Kids...

1335
02:00:35,754 --> 02:00:39,656
we’ll have to do a few hold-ups
to get my business going again.

1336
02:00:39,858 --> 02:00:42,793
-Your business, Li’l Z’?
-What’s your problem, kid?

1337
02:00:42,995 --> 02:00:45,657
This is for our friend,
motherfucker!

1338
02:00:45,864 --> 02:00:47,388
A Soviet attack!

1339
02:00:54,706 --> 02:00:57,641
The business is ours!

1340
02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:55,730
This picture of the hood
will get me the job.

1341
02:01:58,070 --> 02:01:59,935
This one will make me famous.

1342
02:02:00,138 --> 02:02:02,902
It’ll even make the cover
of a magazine.

1343
02:02:05,210 --> 02:02:08,805
I won’t have to worry
about Li’l Z' anymore.

1344
02:02:10,749 --> 02:02:13,445
But the cops?

1345
02:02:20,792 --> 02:02:25,229
GANGSTER, SELF-STYLED "BOSS"
OF THE CITY OF GOD, SHOT DEAD

1346
02:02:27,666 --> 02:02:32,262
This photo could’ve gotten
us killed?

1347
02:02:32,471 --> 02:02:34,029
I think so.

1348
02:02:34,239 --> 02:02:36,935
At least it got you a job.

1349
02:02:37,142 --> 02:02:40,976
-Not a job, an internship.
-It pays a little, doesn’t it?

1350
02:02:41,179 --> 02:02:43,613
A little.

1351
02:02:43,882 --> 02:02:46,851
What about that lady journalist?
Was she a good lay?

1352
02:02:47,052 --> 02:02:49,418
-More or less.
-You didn’t like it?

1353
02:02:49,621 --> 02:02:52,055
I don't think journalists know how
to screw.

1354
02:02:52,257 --> 02:02:53,246
Yeah, I guess so.

1355
02:02:53,458 --> 02:02:55,824
Cocoa robbed 3 houses in Barra.

1356
02:02:56,027 --> 02:02:57,619
Better kill him.

1357
02:02:57,829 --> 02:02:59,490
Who shot Roger?

1358
02:02:59,698 --> 02:03:02,030
-It was Beef.
-Kill that fucker.

1359
02:03:02,234 --> 02:03:04,600
We should kill the Chief
and Gringo as well.

1360
02:03:04,803 --> 02:03:08,295
-What about Cherry?
-Let’s go. Us two, and 3 others...

1361
02:03:08,507 --> 02:03:10,372
It’s a deal.

1362
02:03:10,575 --> 02:03:13,169
Have you heard
of the Red Brigade?

1363
02:03:13,378 --> 02:03:16,677
No, but if they come,
we’ll kill them.

1364
02:03:17,048 --> 02:03:21,314
-Who knows how to write?
-Me, sort of.

1365
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:24,553
Let’s make a black list.
We’ll kill them all.

1366
02:03:24,756 --> 02:03:28,317
-Put fucking Nightowl on there.
-And Croquet.

1367
02:03:28,527 --> 02:03:30,051
Leonard, too, he owes me money.

1368
02:03:30,262 --> 02:03:32,196
And China-Man,
he thinks he’s hot stuff.

1369
02:03:32,397 --> 02:03:35,389
-And Claudio.
-Where’s Giant?

1370
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:38,330
Come on, Giant!

1371
02:03:52,784 --> 02:03:56,447
I forgot to say,
my name isn't Rocket anymore.

1372
02:03:56,655 --> 02:03:58,885
BASED ON A REAL STORY
I’m now Wilson Rodrigues...

1373
02:03:59,090 --> 02:04:00,785
photographer.

1374
02:04:21,813 --> 02:04:23,610
Manuel Machado,
a.k.a. Knockout Ned...

1375
02:04:23,815 --> 02:04:26,909
was hospitalized after
being wounded by Li’l Z”s gang.

1376
02:04:27,118 --> 02:04:30,110
On leaving the hospital,
our reporter interviewed him.

1377
02:04:30,322 --> 02:04:33,382
Many have died.
Mostly innocent people.

1378
02:04:33,592 --> 02:04:37,221
Just knowing me is enough...

1379
02:04:37,429 --> 02:04:41,263
just being my friend...

1380
02:04:41,466 --> 02:04:45,402
If he thinks someone knows me,
he'll kill them.

1381
02:04:45,604 --> 02:04:47,504
The police don’t go in there?

1382
02:04:47,706 --> 02:04:53,076
They go after me, not him.

1383
02:04:53,278 --> 02:04:58,341
I’ve been in jail 3 times,
while he goes on...

1384
02:04:58,550 --> 02:05:01,041
killing undisturbed.

1385
02:05:01,253 --> 02:05:03,915
And they don’t arrest him.

1386
02:05:04,322 --> 02:05:06,847
Knockout Ned says
the war will continue.

1387
02:05:07,058 --> 02:05:11,927
Police Chief Guedes has promised to
arrest both gangs in the City of God.
