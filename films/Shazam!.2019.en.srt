1
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:03,726
Thad?

2
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:06,130
I said no toys at Grandfather's.

3
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,791
But it's Christmas.

4
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:11,243
Stop it!
Hey.

5
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:12,877
Hey! Dad!
Hey!

6
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:15,763
Thad, you can't go crying,

7
00:01:15,764 --> 00:01:17,134
to other people all the time.

8
00:01:17,168 --> 00:01:20,833
A man needs to know when
to stand up for himself.

9
00:01:21,704 --> 00:01:23,237
Dear Magic isn't real Ball,

10
00:01:24,365 --> 00:01:26,166
will Thad ever be a man.

11
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,837
Outlook not so good.

12
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:46,577
You broke it.

13
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:49,427
Dad?

14
00:01:50,406 --> 00:01:51,206
Sid?

15
00:01:56,314 --> 00:01:57,436
Someone help me!

16
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:00,204
Help!

17
00:02:28,988 --> 00:02:29,988
Hello?

18
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,060
<i>Thaddeus.</i>

19
00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:24,922
Thaddeus Sivana.

20
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:27,171
Who are you?

21
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,664
How do you know my name?

22
00:03:29,716 --> 00:03:32,651
I am the last of the consul of wizards.

23
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,884
Sworn to protect realms
from the Seven Deadly Sins.

24
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:43,868
For years have passed,

25
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:46,597
and I grow weak.

26
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:49,725
That is why I seek a champion,

27
00:03:49,726 --> 00:03:51,361
to inherit my magic.

28
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:54,462
You want me, to do magic?

29
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:55,949
With this...

30
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,904
all of my powers will become yours.

31
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:07,245
But first...

32
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:11,362
you must demonstrate
that you're pure of heart,

33
00:04:11,422 --> 00:04:13,350
and strong in spirit.

34
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:18,627
He lies.

35
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:22,963
Don't be his champion.

36
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:26,952
We can give you power.

37
00:04:27,463 --> 00:04:29,939
Take the eye.

38
00:04:33,427 --> 00:04:34,596
<i>Take it.</i>

39
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:40,005
Your father thinks you're weak.

40
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,227
Show him your power.

41
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:54,348
No!

42
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,899
What? What happened?

43
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:04,084
Only the purest of hearts,
can resist their temptations.

44
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:06,000
But you...

45
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:07,940
you will never be worthy.

46
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:16,499
Wait.

47
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,898
I'm good enough, I swear!
What?

48
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:19,438
Let me back in!

49
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:21,839
Calm down, Thad!
Let me back in!

50
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,739
Calm down.
Stop it!

51
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,932
Calm down. Thad!
Stop!

52
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:25,133
Stop it!
Hey, I'm gonna kill you.

53
00:05:25,234 --> 00:05:25,934
Stop!

54
00:05:27,946 --> 00:05:28,646
Thad...

55
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:45,397
I was just there.

56
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:47,099
This man.

57
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,100
This wizard.

58
00:05:48,298 --> 00:05:49,792
He took me to a castle...
Thad?

59
00:05:49,993 --> 00:05:50,993
And...
Stop!

60
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,267
Stop it!

61
00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:55,993
You miserable, whiny, little shit!

62
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:57,787
You coulda killed us!

63
00:05:58,088 --> 00:05:59,501
Do you understand that?

64
00:06:46,268 --> 00:06:47,168
Dad?

65
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,649
Dad!

66
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:02,173
Dad?

67
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:05,409
You're ok.

68
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:07,768
You're gonna be ok.

69
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:15,832
You did this.

70
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:17,981
You did this!

71
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:20,099
No.

72
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Dad...

73
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:33,285
FIND US

74
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,481
Your magic grows weak.

75
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:51,978
Soon you won't be able to contain us.

76
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,743
Seeking spells!

77
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,684
Find me one soul who is worthy!

78
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:03,771
No matter how long it takes.

79
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:49,832
Holy moly!

80
00:08:50,057 --> 00:08:51,361
The boys in blue!

81
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,189
Sheriff, glad to see you.

82
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,073
I called as soon as I saw.

83
00:08:56,056 --> 00:08:57,149
They're in there.

84
00:08:57,877 --> 00:08:58,959
You stay here.

85
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,959
Police!

86
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:06,554
I saw them hide back in there.

87
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:12,920
Police, coming in!
Police!

88
00:09:16,617 --> 00:09:17,749
There's nobody here.
What do you mean?

89
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,688
It's a closet.

90
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:19,794
You really bought that?

91
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,601
Hey, no, no, no!

92
00:09:26,138 --> 00:09:27,482
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

93
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:31,001
Open this up right now, kid!

94
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:33,298
That's a federal offense, kid!
You can't do that!

95
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,528
Don't go in that car.

96
00:09:35,112 --> 00:09:36,212
Come on, open the door, please.

97
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:37,602
Please, come on!
Please!

98
00:09:40,387 --> 00:09:42,007
Open this door, right now!

99
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,220
Come on!

100
00:09:44,553 --> 00:09:45,660
Very good, very funny.

101
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:47,138
Very funny. That's great.

102
00:09:47,194 --> 00:09:48,483
That's hilarious, yeah.

103
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,225
Hey dispatch, we need backup at
the Laurelwood shopping center, please.

104
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:58,270
Dispatch, cancel that request.

105
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:00,248
Some kid stole our walkie-talkies.

106
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:03,317
<i>Walkie-talkies?
How old are you?</i>

107
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:12,116
No, no, no, no.
That's my lunch, kid!

108
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:17,925
Miss Batson, I've...

109
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,925
I've been looking for you.

110
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,591
No. Gosh.

111
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:26,663
It's me, it's Billy.

112
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,176
Ok.

113
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:42,669
I want the tiger.

114
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:44,121
I know honey, I know.

115
00:10:44,168 --> 00:10:46,621
But Mom's not exactly going pro here.

116
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,209
We got one!

117
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:55,577
But I wanted a tiger!

118
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,986
Oh, but this is the real prize, baby.

119
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,750
See?

120
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,535
You can use that your whole life.

121
00:11:01,715 --> 00:11:03,144
You'll always find your way.

122
00:11:23,804 --> 00:11:25,733
I can't let the ball get away.

123
00:11:34,881 --> 00:11:36,118
Mom?

124
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:43,301
Mom!

125
00:11:49,874 --> 00:11:50,937
Mom!

126
00:11:53,077 --> 00:11:54,077
Hey.

127
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:55,805
Who are you with, bud?

128
00:11:58,108 --> 00:12:00,061
Yeah, he says it's Billy Batson.

129
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,029
Don't worry, kid.

130
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,384
I'm sure she'll come looking
before too long, ok?

131
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:06,996
They always do.

132
00:12:15,356 --> 00:12:16,378
Mom.

133
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:18,197
I'm home.

134
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,935
Yes?

135
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,780
Yeah...

136
00:12:55,187 --> 00:12:57,679
Is... Is Rachel Batson?

137
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:58,975
Who's asking?

138
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,515
Yeah, see the thing is...

139
00:13:03,663 --> 00:13:05,163
I think you're my mom.

140
00:13:08,702 --> 00:13:10,258
You sure about that?

141
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:14,465
Sorry to bother you.

142
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,185
<i>You just had to take my lunch?</i>

143
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,354
<i>You save me any fries?</i>

144
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:28,955
Foster home in Pittsburgh reported
you missing two weeks ago.

145
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:30,837
You sending me back?

146
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:32,052
No.

147
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,275
They don't want you.

148
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:35,670
Harsh.

149
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:36,695
You laugh,

150
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,288
but you've run from foster homes
in six counties, Mr. Batson.

151
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:41,949
From...

152
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,524
good people...

153
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:47,992
who want you, all in pursuit of
someone who arguably does not.

154
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,355
It's time someone looked you in
the eye and told it to you straight.

155
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,510
I don't need parents
to play make believe with.

156
00:13:56,782 --> 00:13:57,948
I got a mom.

157
00:13:58,059 --> 00:13:58,807
Yes.

158
00:13:59,488 --> 00:14:00,948
You're some detective.

159
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:03,143
73 Batsons,

160
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:05,410
between the ages of 28 to 40,

161
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,036
and you've crossed out every one.

162
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:08,617
She's still out there.

163
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:10,125
I know it.

164
00:14:18,673 --> 00:14:21,412
There's a couple outside, Mr. Batson.

165
00:14:21,515 --> 00:14:23,205
They run a group home.

166
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:26,172
I can take care of myself.

167
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:27,597
When you're 18.

168
00:14:27,922 --> 00:14:29,107
Until then,

169
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:30,573
I won't have you living on the streets

170
00:14:30,598 --> 00:14:33,311
looking for someone
who never looked for you.

171
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,925
Give these people a chance.

172
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:38,183
Because that's what they're giving you.

173
00:14:38,848 --> 00:14:40,345
You're out of options.

174
00:14:51,401 --> 00:14:52,758
Alright, let's get the spiel.

175
00:14:53,006 --> 00:14:54,768
Just know that me and Rosa, we get it.

176
00:14:55,163 --> 00:14:56,631
We were foster kids back in the day.

177
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:57,984
Back in the dark ages.

178
00:14:58,124 --> 00:14:59,024
Girl!

179
00:14:59,171 --> 00:15:00,447
I'm young at heart.

180
00:15:00,598 --> 00:15:01,942
I got my finger on the pulse.

181
00:15:02,021 --> 00:15:04,781
Yeah, that's a reference to his
blood pressure because he's old.

182
00:15:04,982 --> 00:15:06,542
Billy, do you have any food allergies?

183
00:15:06,743 --> 00:15:08,342
Gonna wish you did.
Darla's cooking.

184
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:09,709
Oy, guerito!
What?

185
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:14,193
We know how overwhelming
it can all be.

186
00:15:14,418 --> 00:15:15,780
New house, new faces.

187
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,425
All up in your face.

188
00:15:17,556 --> 00:15:18,841
Just...

189
00:15:19,142 --> 00:15:20,153
take it at your own speed.

190
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,287
Hello?

191
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:36,835
We're home!

192
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,962
That's what happens when you suck!

193
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:42,068
So much for the welcome party.

194
00:15:42,152 --> 00:15:45,152
Yeah, that thing growing out
of the couch would be Eugene.

195
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:46,956
Is that him?

196
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:48,648
Oh, my gosh! Billy!

197
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,141
Slow down, slow down!

198
00:15:50,294 --> 00:15:51,477
Welcome home!

199
00:15:51,916 --> 00:15:53,590
And that's Darla.
I'm Darla.

200
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:54,629
Big hugger.

201
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:55,654
I noticed.

202
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:57,688
Die! Die! Die!

203
00:15:57,978 --> 00:16:00,080
He doesn't mean that.
It's the game.

204
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:03,396
Hey.

205
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,427
No sodas after dark, remember?

206
00:16:05,826 --> 00:16:08,001
When did it get dark?

207
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:10,599
Oh, the poster. I made you one.
Come look!

208
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:13,245
Oh, no!

209
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,527
Sorry, Pedro must've been working out.

210
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,833
His goal is to get swole.

211
00:16:20,802 --> 00:16:21,802
Here.

212
00:16:23,136 --> 00:16:24,136
Yes.

213
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:27,446
Exactly why your Math Department
is so uniquely suited for me.

214
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:30,539
I can't, I can't, even with
Eugene right now.

215
00:16:30,706 --> 00:16:32,293
Sorry. Mary, hi.

216
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,580
College interview.

217
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:35,792
I'm Billy.
What am I most excited about?

218
00:16:37,588 --> 00:16:40,269
What a great question.
I was hoping you'd ask.

219
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:44,840
Mention you're a foster kid.
Colleges eat that up.

220
00:16:45,361 --> 00:16:47,218
What I'm most excited about?

221
00:16:47,543 --> 00:16:49,020
Is the campus experience.

222
00:16:49,021 --> 00:16:51,117
As a foster child, I'm a big believer,

223
00:16:51,142 --> 00:16:53,270
in finding family and friends in the most...

224
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:54,516
unlikely of places.

225
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,699
I'm gonna miss that girl so much!

226
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:01,966
It's Caltech, it's a very prestigious school.

227
00:17:02,043 --> 00:17:03,675
And also all the way in California.

228
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:05,617
But we don't have to talk
about that right now.

229
00:17:05,681 --> 00:17:07,432
It's a tough subject for me.

230
00:17:07,598 --> 00:17:08,820
Do you like vegan food?

231
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:10,817
Because, see I love animals.

232
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:14,938
Oh, no! The Tofurkey!

233
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,530
Oh, no, we may have
to eat a real turkey!

234
00:17:16,762 --> 00:17:17,917
Is that?
It's ok.

235
00:17:17,918 --> 00:17:19,167
Come, I'll show you your room.

236
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,758
It's a bit of a madhouse, I know but...

237
00:17:22,422 --> 00:17:23,422
it's fun!

238
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:26,966
Watch the bumps step.

239
00:17:26,985 --> 00:17:29,066
Pedro, mi amor, hola.

240
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,244
Say hi to Billy.

241
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,494
Don't take it personally.

242
00:17:33,495 --> 00:17:34,680
He's like that with everyone.

243
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:39,416
Freddy.

244
00:17:40,943 --> 00:17:42,451
This is Billy Batson.

245
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,872
Make sure you make him
feel at home, ok?

246
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:46,927
Maybe don't say anything too weird?

247
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:48,671
Oh, one weird thing is,

248
00:17:48,672 --> 00:17:50,966
did you know the Romans used
to brush their teeth with their urine?

249
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,527
And apparently, it works.

250
00:18:05,406 --> 00:18:07,540
Oh, it's...
it's a long way down.

251
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:10,229
Trust me, I speak from experience.

252
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:15,277
Victor pushed me.

253
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:17,443
They seem nice,

254
00:18:17,544 --> 00:18:18,580
but don't buy it.

255
00:18:19,492 --> 00:18:21,725
It gets real Game of Thrones
around here.

256
00:18:23,354 --> 00:18:24,417
What?

257
00:18:26,182 --> 00:18:27,121
Dude, I'm...

258
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:28,433
just, messing around.

259
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:29,533
It's...

260
00:18:29,534 --> 00:18:30,776
it's terminal cancer I...

261
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,701
I only have three months.

262
00:18:33,949 --> 00:18:35,321
Kidding, again!

263
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:37,192
You look at me and you're like,
why so dark?

264
00:18:37,193 --> 00:18:39,345
You're a disabled foster kid,
you've got it all. Right?

265
00:18:41,338 --> 00:18:43,365
Oh, yeah, that's the...

266
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:44,105
the old batarang.

267
00:18:44,531 --> 00:18:45,818
I mean it's a replica but...

268
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:47,410
Feel how sharp.

269
00:18:47,612 --> 00:18:49,431
I could kill you in your sleep
with that thing.

270
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:52,028
You ever a supes guy?

271
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:53,930
Yeah, me too.

272
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:56,396
Behold, the holy grail.

273
00:18:56,944 --> 00:18:59,136
One nine millimeter round
shot at Superman himself.

274
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,527
It's legit.

275
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:02,693
Probably worth, I don't know,
five, six hundred, maybe more.

276
00:19:04,216 --> 00:19:05,272
What's in the bag?

277
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:05,989
Hey.

278
00:19:06,314 --> 00:19:08,408
Hey, it's all good.
It's good to maintain boundaries.

279
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:11,964
You don't gotta talk so much,
you know.

280
00:19:13,343 --> 00:19:14,913
I mean, this place is great.

281
00:19:15,114 --> 00:19:15,819
You're gonna love it.

282
00:19:40,683 --> 00:19:41,642
Dinner!

283
00:19:49,175 --> 00:19:50,605
All hands on deck!

284
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,990
Sweet.

285
00:19:54,347 --> 00:19:55,631
Thank you for this family.

286
00:19:55,681 --> 00:19:57,253
Thank you for this day.

287
00:19:57,512 --> 00:19:58,691
Thank you for this food.

288
00:19:59,151 --> 00:20:00,953
Even if it's not steak fillet.

289
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:07,082
Big school. 2,000 students,
you might think,

290
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:08,502
so many strangers.

291
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:10,339
But not if you think of them as,

292
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,795
possible for each friend, then it's...

293
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:13,445
So many friends.

294
00:20:13,783 --> 00:20:15,820
The principal, her name's Shirley.

295
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:16,932
She's the best.

296
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:17,991
Next.

297
00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:20,669
This is our security scanner.

298
00:20:20,794 --> 00:20:22,936
Like in an airport.
It's totally safe.

299
00:20:23,017 --> 00:20:24,412
I know what it is.

300
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:26,448
Does she always do this?

301
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:29,551
Silence makes me uncomfortable.

302
00:20:29,648 --> 00:20:31,769
She's almost never uncomfortable.

303
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:36,142
Have a good first day, big brother.

304
00:20:36,143 --> 00:20:38,185
Look, you don't have
to hug me all the time.

305
00:20:38,396 --> 00:20:40,630
We're not actually brother
and sister so...

306
00:20:41,895 --> 00:20:43,436
I'm sorry.

307
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:48,755
Hey.
Hey.

308
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:50,960
I. I didn't mean to make her...

309
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,319
<i>I was overwhelmed, honestly.</i>

310
00:20:57,731 --> 00:21:01,203
<i>He said, I must be pure of heart.</i>

311
00:21:01,404 --> 00:21:04,087
<i>He called himself a wizard.</i>

312
00:21:04,171 --> 00:21:05,522
<i>He is just like a...</i>

313
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:08,316
<i>a wizard from Harry Potter, some...</i>

314
00:21:09,464 --> 00:21:12,441
<i>But you're saying that other
people have experienced this?</i>

315
00:21:12,592 --> 00:21:14,176
In a sense, yes.

316
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:16,422
Do you remember what he said to you?

317
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:19,036
<i>He tested me.</i>

318
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,234
<i>There were these statues.</i>

319
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:25,035
<i>Their eyes, it's like
they were looking at me,</i>

320
00:21:25,036 --> 00:21:26,125
<i>making me think things.</i>

321
00:21:26,924 --> 00:21:28,285
<i>Horrible things.</i>

322
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,657
And do these approximate
what you saw?

323
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:35,319
<i>Yes. That's exactly how I remember it.</i>

324
00:21:36,302 --> 00:21:37,703
<i>I don't understand.
How do you know?</i>

325
00:21:37,704 --> 00:21:41,908
Recurring imagery has proven very
common in cases of mass hysteria.

326
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:43,479
<i>Mass hysteria?</i>

327
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:44,504
I know.

328
00:21:44,614 --> 00:21:46,232
The term's a bit theatrical.

329
00:21:46,357 --> 00:21:48,616
But take UFO sightings, for example.

330
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:51,289
Lights in the sky, flying saucers.

331
00:21:51,648 --> 00:21:54,688
Isolated incidents of people
who do not know each other...

332
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:55,816
The symbols.

333
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,430
Ask her about the symbols.

334
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,186
Sorry, Ms. Kwan.

335
00:22:04,537 --> 00:22:06,880
But as an example of recurring imagery,

336
00:22:07,345 --> 00:22:09,093
maybe you recall seeing

337
00:22:09,218 --> 00:22:11,656
these symbols before
the alleged abduction?

338
00:22:12,855 --> 00:22:14,776
<i>I don't remember any symbols, no.</i>

339
00:22:15,638 --> 00:22:17,228
<i>I think I got it on video.</i>

340
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:18,502
<i>There was something...</i>

341
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:21,894
<i>I remember the numbers on
my alarm clock, they kept</i>

342
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:23,151
<i>shifting.</i>

343
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,240
Video?

344
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:27,352
Show me the video.

345
00:22:28,398 --> 00:22:30,257
Ms. Kwan, this is Dr. Sivana.

346
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:33,233
<i>One moment, I can send it.</i>

347
00:22:34,803 --> 00:22:35,703
<i>Hello?</i>

348
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,500
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

349
00:22:37,755 --> 00:22:38,559
<i>Who's there?</i>

350
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,400
<i>Hello?</i>

351
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:42,433
<i>What's going on?
What's happening?</i>

352
00:22:44,402 --> 00:22:46,202
<i>I'm. I'm going to call the police.</i>

353
00:22:47,912 --> 00:22:50,265
<i>Then this blinding light all around me.</i>

354
00:22:50,316 --> 00:22:52,899
<i>And I felt like I was getting
pulled down into something.</i>

355
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,989
<i>I felt like a temple carved
inside a mountain...</i>

356
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,265
<i>He looked exactly what you'd expect
from a guy who calls himself a wizard,</i>

357
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:01,166
<i>and how you were brought
there to save the world.</i>

358
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:02,602
<i>Wearing a cape.
And there is no ceiling.</i>

359
00:23:02,603 --> 00:23:03,936
<i>We ran the numbers again...</i>

360
00:23:04,352 --> 00:23:05,352
Dr. Sivana!

361
00:23:06,307 --> 00:23:08,765
I appreciate your enthusiasm.

362
00:23:08,926 --> 00:23:11,051
But you're funding my project.

363
00:23:11,176 --> 00:23:13,970
And when I'm interviewing,
I don't wanna be interrupted.

364
00:23:14,284 --> 00:23:16,059
56 reported abductions.

365
00:23:16,434 --> 00:23:17,892
I never saw it.
Saw what?

366
00:23:34,428 --> 00:23:35,834
Doctor, what is all this?

367
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,119
All these years...

368
00:23:40,611 --> 00:23:41,826
I was convinced...

369
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:44,401
I had the incorrect sequence.

370
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:46,044
Or perhaps...

371
00:23:46,703 --> 00:23:50,019
the wrong symbols to open the door.

372
00:23:51,432 --> 00:23:53,452
But on that woman's alarm clock,

373
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,102
the seven symbols.

374
00:23:57,351 --> 00:23:58,429
The sequence...

375
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:00,832
repeated itself...

376
00:24:01,764 --> 00:24:03,110
seven times.

377
00:24:05,055 --> 00:24:06,355
That's the difference.

378
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:08,306
Is this some sort of joke?

379
00:24:08,486 --> 00:24:10,086
It may seem that way to you.

380
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,710
Because we're not in actuality,

381
00:24:12,936 --> 00:24:14,664
studying mass hysteria.

382
00:24:14,904 --> 00:24:16,715
What all these people have seen,

383
00:24:17,655 --> 00:24:19,455
every single one of them,

384
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,189
is absolutely real.

385
00:24:22,304 --> 00:24:24,525
An alarm clock malfunctions,

386
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,298
and your first thought is
it's proof of a wizard?

387
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,657
Come on, Dr. Sivana.

388
00:24:29,888 --> 00:24:32,356
You can't believe any of this is real.

389
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:46,312
Why yes.

390
00:24:52,653 --> 00:24:53,653
Yes, I do.

391
00:25:32,622 --> 00:25:34,628
I've been waiting for this moment,

392
00:25:35,324 --> 00:25:36,633
for so long.

393
00:25:38,506 --> 00:25:39,743
And now here we are.

394
00:25:40,769 --> 00:25:42,159
You don't remember me, do you?

395
00:25:49,254 --> 00:25:51,214
I remember you.

396
00:25:52,613 --> 00:25:54,077
You were a boy.

397
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:56,423
And now you dare intrude
in my kingdom.

398
00:25:56,448 --> 00:25:58,648
Do you know what it's like
for a child to be told,

399
00:25:58,649 --> 00:25:59,988
you'll never be good enough?

400
00:26:00,367 --> 00:26:01,593
No you don't.

401
00:26:02,317 --> 00:26:04,617
What you said to me all those years ago,

402
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:07,202
made me realize who I really was.

403
00:26:07,203 --> 00:26:08,403
And you know something?

404
00:26:11,462 --> 00:26:13,303
I am not pure of heart.

405
00:26:13,827 --> 00:26:18,260
The wizard is too weak to stop us.

406
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:22,147
No.

407
00:26:22,543 --> 00:26:23,543
No!

408
00:26:32,561 --> 00:26:35,839
You never found your champion.

409
00:26:36,655 --> 00:26:39,955
But we found ours.

410
00:26:54,671 --> 00:26:58,512
You are the true champion.

411
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,628
They're using you.

412
00:27:32,032 --> 00:27:34,294
You're nothing to them
but a means of escape.

413
00:27:40,804 --> 00:27:44,304
Through you, they'll spread their
poison to everything they touch!

414
00:27:44,934 --> 00:27:47,254
Make mankind turn on each other!

415
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:50,477
You seek a pure soul old man.

416
00:27:51,026 --> 00:27:52,657
But no one's worthy.

417
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:04,417
Flight or invisibility?

418
00:28:05,972 --> 00:28:07,264
If you could have one superpower,

419
00:28:07,489 --> 00:28:08,918
flight or invisibility,
what would you pick?

420
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:11,287
I mean, everybody chooses flight.

421
00:28:11,588 --> 00:28:12,488
You know why?

422
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:14,265
So they can fly away
from this conversation?

423
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:15,602
No. Because heroes fly.

424
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,235
And who doesn't want people
to think they're a hero, right?

425
00:28:17,685 --> 00:28:19,728
But. But invisibility, no way I mean,

426
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:21,129
that's pervy.

427
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,010
Spying around on people who
don't even know you're there.

428
00:28:23,011 --> 00:28:24,076
Sneaking around everywhere.

429
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,778
It's a total villain power, right?

430
00:28:33,176 --> 00:28:34,841
Then they did this study,
and this is a real thing.

431
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,103
They asked people the same question.

432
00:28:36,104 --> 00:28:37,829
You know, what power do you want?
But this time,

433
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,193
they made it, so the answers
were anonymous.

434
00:28:39,355 --> 00:28:40,452
And. And most people,

435
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:42,453
since they knew that it was secret,
said invisibility.

436
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:43,706
And I think that's because most people

437
00:28:43,731 --> 00:28:45,855
don't feel like heroes
on the inside, deep down.

438
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:47,651
You're gonna run away.

439
00:28:48,691 --> 00:28:50,603
I mean, you stole my Superman bullet.

440
00:28:51,123 --> 00:28:53,012
Dude, I get it. I get it.

441
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,780
You've been screwed over
way too many times.

442
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,100
You don't trust anyone.

443
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:58,092
But that's the thing about invisibility.

444
00:28:59,126 --> 00:29:00,634
You end up all by yourself.

445
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:03,875
I didn't steal your dumb bullet.

446
00:29:09,202 --> 00:29:11,102
Hey, how was it today?

447
00:29:12,316 --> 00:29:13,416
That good?

448
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,913
Oh, my God! Freddy!

449
00:29:21,473 --> 00:29:22,173
Are you ok?

450
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:23,046
Freddy.

451
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:26,106
What the hell?

452
00:29:26,345 --> 00:29:27,697
What is wrong with you two?

453
00:29:28,915 --> 00:29:30,215
No way that's gonna buff out.

454
00:29:30,216 --> 00:29:31,382
You gonna pay for that, Freeman?

455
00:29:31,383 --> 00:29:33,212
For the dent you made almost hitting me?

456
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:34,178
Yeah, sure...

457
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:35,631
You guys take these?

458
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:40,723
Brett, stop!

459
00:29:42,223 --> 00:29:43,636
Don't touch my brother!

460
00:29:43,737 --> 00:29:46,109
What, you need your fake
family to stand up for you?

461
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,496
Stand up for yourself, Freeman.
Yeah?

462
00:29:47,754 --> 00:29:50,120
Hey Freeman. Here, stand up.
Stand up for yourself.

463
00:29:50,306 --> 00:29:52,202
What are you gonna do?
Go home and cry to mommy?

464
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,510
Oh, yeah, you don't have a mommy.

465
00:29:55,381 --> 00:29:56,431
Stop hurting him!

466
00:29:56,658 --> 00:29:57,358
Hey!

467
00:30:00,237 --> 00:30:01,820
Man, sorry about that.

468
00:30:02,345 --> 00:30:03,252
That wasn't fair but,

469
00:30:03,253 --> 00:30:04,653
then again you don't fight fair, so...

470
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,754
Back off assbags!
I know how to use these things!

471
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:18,960
Hey!

472
00:30:19,261 --> 00:30:20,449
He's getting away!
Where you going?

473
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:22,675
Freddy, are you ok?

474
00:30:24,478 --> 00:30:25,610
Hey, let's go through the back.

475
00:30:25,612 --> 00:30:26,647
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

476
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,196
Nowhere to run!

477
00:30:36,555 --> 00:30:37,155
Hey!

478
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,812
Go, go, go!
Grab him!

479
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:40,333
Move! Get out of the way!
Move!

480
00:30:40,734 --> 00:30:41,734
Move, woman!

481
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,260
No, no, no, no!

482
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,348
You're dead, kid!

483
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:49,041
Yeah, you think you're funny?

484
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,930
We know where you go to school, buddy!

485
00:30:53,264 --> 00:30:55,914
<i>Next stop, 30th Street Station.</i>

486
00:30:56,202 --> 00:30:58,742
<i>Change for the Regional Rail Line.</i>

487
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:18,726
Hello?

488
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:20,556
What's going on?

489
00:31:34,992 --> 00:31:36,177
Help!

490
00:31:50,631 --> 00:31:51,766
Ok.

491
00:32:07,648 --> 00:32:08,957
Holy moly.

492
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,473
Hello?

493
00:32:41,466 --> 00:32:42,784
What the hell?

494
00:32:43,486 --> 00:32:44,709
Who's doing this?

495
00:33:16,906 --> 00:33:17,789
Hi...

496
00:33:19,325 --> 00:33:21,927
I was supposed to get off at 30th.

497
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:23,280
Billy Batson.

498
00:33:23,516 --> 00:33:25,175
How'd you know my name?

499
00:33:25,223 --> 00:33:28,518
I am the last of the Council of wizards.

500
00:33:29,854 --> 00:33:32,413
Keeper of the Rock of Eternity.

501
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:35,171
You're...

502
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,174
that guy.

503
00:33:37,867 --> 00:33:39,558
Hey listen, I don't have any money.

504
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,546
Do not patronize me, boy!

505
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:47,398
You are standing
in the source of all magic.

506
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:49,602
The Rock of Eternity.

507
00:33:49,781 --> 00:33:52,395
Seven thrones of seven wizards.

508
00:33:53,122 --> 00:33:55,852
But long ago, we chose a champion.

509
00:33:56,632 --> 00:33:58,115
And we chose recklessly.

510
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,172
He used his power for revenge.

511
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:08,743
Releasing the Seven Deadly
Sins into your world.

512
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:14,812
Millions of lives were lost.

513
00:34:15,175 --> 00:34:17,376
Entire civilizations,

514
00:34:17,777 --> 00:34:19,856
erased from existence.

515
00:34:23,466 --> 00:34:27,569
That is why I vowed
never to pass on my magic,

516
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:31,843
until I find one truly good person.

517
00:34:32,374 --> 00:34:34,045
Strong in spirit.

518
00:34:35,053 --> 00:34:36,482
Pure in heart.

519
00:34:37,502 --> 00:34:38,516
Look, man,

520
00:34:39,217 --> 00:34:40,830
maybe this is magic.

521
00:34:41,363 --> 00:34:42,795
I. I don't know but...

522
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,156
the people you're looking for,
good, pure people...

523
00:34:47,228 --> 00:34:48,255
I'm not one of them.

524
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:51,238
I. I don't know if anyone is, really.

525
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,656
You, Billy Batson,

526
00:34:55,057 --> 00:34:56,698
are all I have.

527
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,083
All the world has.

528
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,557
Lay your hands on this staff.

529
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:04,701
Gross.

530
00:35:04,868 --> 00:35:07,987
And say my name so my
powers may flow through you.

531
00:35:08,212 --> 00:35:11,273
I open my heart to you, Billy Batson.

532
00:35:12,137 --> 00:35:13,522
And in so doing,

533
00:35:13,813 --> 00:35:15,854
choose you as champion.

534
00:35:16,024 --> 00:35:17,029
Thanks.

535
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:18,540
Real sweet of you mister, but I...

536
00:35:18,765 --> 00:35:20,048
really gotta get going.

537
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:23,674
My brothers and sisters
were slain by the Sins.

538
00:35:24,031 --> 00:35:26,863
Their thrones lie empty!

539
00:35:27,742 --> 00:35:29,726
My magic must be passed on.

540
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:30,972
Now.

541
00:35:31,386 --> 00:35:32,859
Speak my name!

542
00:35:33,537 --> 00:35:35,001
I. I don't know your name, sir.

543
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:36,208
We just met.

544
00:35:36,326 --> 00:35:39,091
My name is...

545
00:35:39,578 --> 00:35:40,921
Shazam.

546
00:35:43,124 --> 00:35:44,203
Wait, for real?

547
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:45,356
Say it!
Ok.

548
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,482
Jeez.

549
00:35:58,616 --> 00:35:59,925
So just say it?

550
00:36:00,415 --> 00:36:01,493
Like...

551
00:36:02,395 --> 00:36:03,395
Shazam?

552
00:36:03,918 --> 00:36:04,981
Yes!

553
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:08,955
Carry my name and with it,
you carry all my powers.

554
00:36:08,956 --> 00:36:10,446
The wisdom of Solomon!

555
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:11,829
The strength of Hercules!

556
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,530
The stamina of Atlas!

557
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,081
The power of Zeus!

558
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:16,753
The courage of Achilles!

559
00:36:17,006 --> 00:36:18,967
And speed of Mercury!

560
00:36:29,009 --> 00:36:30,807
What happened to me?
Why am I...

561
00:36:30,932 --> 00:36:33,075
Wha.. Wha.. What did you do to me?
What did you do to my voice?

562
00:36:33,414 --> 00:36:37,114
You have been transformed
to your full potential, Billy Batson.

563
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,726
With your heart, unlock your
greatest power.

564
00:36:42,673 --> 00:36:44,998
The thrones of our brothers
and sisters await!

565
00:36:56,813 --> 00:36:58,361
Get me outta here!

566
00:37:00,874 --> 00:37:02,739
Dope!

567
00:37:04,836 --> 00:37:07,580
My brother, I applaud your choices today.

568
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,097
Gold shoes, gold belt, white cape!

569
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,005
It shouldn't work but,

570
00:37:12,006 --> 00:37:13,646
hot damn, it does!

571
00:37:23,247 --> 00:37:24,220
Hey!

572
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:27,647
Hey, babe!

573
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:37,447
Yes, officer, I'm aware
he's run away in the past, I...

574
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,434
23 times?

575
00:37:40,565 --> 00:37:42,327
Guy's got no social media presence.

576
00:37:42,812 --> 00:37:43,850
At all.

577
00:37:44,048 --> 00:37:45,372
The guy is a ghost.

578
00:38:08,826 --> 00:38:10,607
You know guys,
I'm happy to look for Billy.

579
00:38:11,006 --> 00:38:12,036
More than happy.

580
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,465
But now you gotta wash the dishes,
that's what's more important.

581
00:38:14,856 --> 00:38:16,481
What are you gonna do, Freddy?
Run after him?

582
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,366
Very funny!

583
00:38:20,462 --> 00:38:21,508
No wait, don't scream.

584
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:23,469
Victor! Victor! Victor!
No, no!

585
00:38:23,486 --> 00:38:25,076
It's me! It's Billy!
It's Billy!

586
00:38:25,492 --> 00:38:26,545
You asked me,

587
00:38:26,646 --> 00:38:27,729
flight or invisibility?

588
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,775
I thought that was stupid, but now
I look like this and I need your help!

589
00:38:31,335 --> 00:38:32,921
Meet me back here after lights out?

590
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,020
What's up, bud? You alright?

591
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:37,985
Yeah. Yeah.

592
00:38:38,344 --> 00:38:39,144
I'm just...

593
00:38:39,644 --> 00:38:41,576
I'm really sad.

594
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:43,176
Because Billy's gone.

595
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:44,169
And you know,

596
00:38:44,725 --> 00:38:46,819
maybe it's my fault.
Maybe I did it.

597
00:38:47,244 --> 00:38:48,551
You know, maybe I. I snore...

598
00:38:48,698 --> 00:38:49,612
Hey, hey, hey.

599
00:38:49,613 --> 00:38:51,216
Not your fault son, alright.

600
00:38:52,189 --> 00:38:53,237
We'll find him, ok?

601
00:38:54,381 --> 00:38:55,500
You don't snore that bad.

602
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:57,990
But you kinda smell.

603
00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:10,073
Oh, my God!

604
00:39:10,425 --> 00:39:11,951
Hey, stop right there.

605
00:39:12,288 --> 00:39:14,937
How do I know you're not a
supervillain using telepathic abilities

606
00:39:14,962 --> 00:39:16,631
to make me believe that you're Billy?

607
00:39:17,116 --> 00:39:19,104
All I have to do is press dial on this thing.

608
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:20,754
No, no, I have proof, I have proof.

609
00:39:20,915 --> 00:39:21,645
Here.

610
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:24,455
Look, I lied, ok?
I took your bullet.

611
00:39:25,503 --> 00:39:26,991
No, no, no! No!
No! No!

612
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:29,547
Stupid adult hands!

613
00:39:29,957 --> 00:39:31,597
But you saw it.
You saw it, right?

614
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:33,965
Look, Freddy, I swear it's me, ok?

615
00:39:34,628 --> 00:39:36,373
Look, I know we're not really
close friends or anything,

616
00:39:36,398 --> 00:39:37,328
but you're the only person that I know

617
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:39,275
that knows anything about
this Caped Crusader stuff.

618
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:40,551
That's Batman.

619
00:39:40,852 --> 00:39:41,652
What?

620
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:43,443
Forget it.

621
00:39:44,671 --> 00:39:45,774
Can I...

622
00:39:47,483 --> 00:39:48,626
Oh, yeah, yeah.

623
00:39:58,008 --> 00:39:59,675
Oh, my God!

624
00:40:00,503 --> 00:40:01,757
It's crazy, right?

625
00:40:02,887 --> 00:40:03,924
What are your superpowers?

626
00:40:04,341 --> 00:40:07,095
Superpowers? Dude, I don't even
know how to pee in this thing!

627
00:40:07,475 --> 00:40:08,953
Ok, can... Can you fly?

628
00:40:11,884 --> 00:40:13,183
Ok, let's do this.

629
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:15,056
How do we do this?

630
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:16,447
Just...

631
00:40:16,755 --> 00:40:17,733
Just like Superman it.

632
00:40:21,994 --> 00:40:23,450
Oh, my God.
Obviously, you have to jump.

633
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:24,529
Come on.

634
00:40:24,617 --> 00:40:26,188
How is any of this obvious?

635
00:40:26,499 --> 00:40:27,355
Ok.

636
00:40:28,168 --> 00:40:30,717
Try, to believe that you can fly.

637
00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:33,922
Ok, I read this deep dive in the peer
reviewed studies about superpowers

638
00:40:33,923 --> 00:40:36,415
and in 6 out of 10, belief is the key.

639
00:40:37,007 --> 00:40:38,777
Belief, belief, belief.
Ok, ok.

640
00:40:38,902 --> 00:40:39,964
I believe I can fly.

641
00:40:39,965 --> 00:40:40,802
I believe I...

642
00:40:41,283 --> 00:40:42,648
I believe I can fly.

643
00:40:43,534 --> 00:40:44,134
I...

644
00:40:52,277 --> 00:40:53,570
Did you believe?

645
00:40:57,075 --> 00:40:58,123
Yeah.

646
00:40:58,977 --> 00:41:00,002
You wanna try invisibility?

647
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,421
How do I do?

648
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:05,010
You. Forget it. You know.
Ok, ok, ok.

649
00:41:09,412 --> 00:41:11,290
Oh, my God! It worked!

650
00:41:11,487 --> 00:41:12,661
Where'd you go?

651
00:41:14,408 --> 00:41:15,729
I'm right here.
You can't see me?

652
00:41:15,951 --> 00:41:16,951
Where?

653
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,229
I'm invisible!

654
00:41:19,254 --> 00:41:20,743
I'm right here.
Over here.

655
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:23,396
I'm invisible!

656
00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:25,341
I'm invisible!

657
00:41:25,366 --> 00:41:27,579
Hey! Nice outfit, dipshit!

658
00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:30,656
I. I might have...

659
00:41:30,936 --> 00:41:33,336
been testing invisibility and super
intelligence at the same time.

660
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:36,040
Freeman, I'm gonna come
over there and beat you.

661
00:41:44,693 --> 00:41:45,594
Oh, my God!

662
00:41:45,649 --> 00:41:48,189
The lightning emblem! It was staring us
right in the face the whole time!

663
00:41:49,693 --> 00:41:50,693
Literally!

664
00:41:59,318 --> 00:41:59,718
Ok, ok.

665
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:02,036
Clearly, we gotta give you a lightning
themed superhero name.

666
00:42:02,037 --> 00:42:02,685
Yeah.

667
00:42:14,605 --> 00:42:16,286
Oh, right.
Hey, you! Back...

668
00:42:18,605 --> 00:42:19,605
off.

669
00:42:19,976 --> 00:42:21,681
Hyperspeed, check!

670
00:42:23,561 --> 00:42:25,403
I... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

671
00:42:25,404 --> 00:42:26,804
I thought you were the one
who was screaming.

672
00:42:26,827 --> 00:42:28,527
I doused him with pepper spray.

673
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,556
Smart move. Yeah.

674
00:42:30,557 --> 00:42:32,017
Hey, get up, mister mugger guy!

675
00:42:32,018 --> 00:42:33,556
Give the old lady her purse back.

676
00:42:33,557 --> 00:42:34,997
I'm... I'm your age.

677
00:42:35,122 --> 00:42:37,685
And he didn't get a chance to take
it because I didn't let him take it.

678
00:42:38,693 --> 00:42:40,643
Good, yeah, good.
You're really on top of this stuff.

679
00:42:40,901 --> 00:42:42,695
And that should teach you
that old ladies,

680
00:42:42,696 --> 00:42:44,896
regular aged ladies like yourself,

681
00:42:44,897 --> 00:42:46,094
don't need your protecting.

682
00:42:46,379 --> 00:42:47,707
Right? So get woke, bro.

683
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,530
I'm sorry, who are you?

684
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:52,213
His name is Thundercrack!

685
00:42:52,734 --> 00:42:53,946
Hero to the people.

686
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:56,208
With the power and speed
of lightning all in one.

687
00:42:56,209 --> 00:42:57,577
Dude, that sounds like a butt thing.

688
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,144
Mr. Philadelphia!
That's a cream cheese thing, dude!

689
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:03,845
Powerboy, because he's got
all the powers.

690
00:43:03,846 --> 00:43:06,294
Because sometimes pepper spray
can't protect against evil.

691
00:43:07,172 --> 00:43:09,204
Powerboy, do you know this child?

692
00:43:11,058 --> 00:43:13,926
Like, like a teeny little bit.
I don't really know...

693
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:16,327
Yeah, he's, like, my manager.
He's like a miniature manager.

694
00:43:16,328 --> 00:43:17,753
I'm his manager.
The... and you know.

695
00:43:17,754 --> 00:43:20,594
Powerboy's not gonna work either, ok?
So work on something else...

696
00:43:20,595 --> 00:43:22,297
Hey, hey, hey.
Bud. What could...

697
00:43:27,343 --> 00:43:30,143
Electricity manipulation,
hyper-speed, super-strength!

698
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,297
Dude, you're stacked!

699
00:43:31,571 --> 00:43:33,471
You're just cool as Superman,
almost.

700
00:43:33,892 --> 00:43:35,744
I didn't see you,
or what just happened here.

701
00:43:35,975 --> 00:43:37,431
I don't wanna know.
Just don't hurt me.

702
00:43:37,432 --> 00:43:39,218
Oh, no, no, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Thank you for your kind donation.

703
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:40,883
No, no, no, no.
But if you need any more help,

704
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:43,346
just look for the superhero
that still can't fly.

705
00:43:44,025 --> 00:43:46,431
Forget flying man,
we just made 73 bucks!

706
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,480
73 bucks?
See.

707
00:43:48,767 --> 00:43:50,283
Come on!

708
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:52,256
Hey, wait a minute.

709
00:43:53,176 --> 00:43:54,234
I just got an idea.

710
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:57,870
I'd like to purchase some
of your finest beer, please.

711
00:44:17,224 --> 00:44:19,634
I don't know about this.
I mean, we don't have a fake ID even.

712
00:44:19,635 --> 00:44:21,907
Freddy, Freddy, would you relax?

713
00:44:22,012 --> 00:44:23,500
Look at me, I am the fake ID.

714
00:44:24,405 --> 00:44:26,205
Everything from the register!
Go! Go!

715
00:44:26,644 --> 00:44:28,050
Now! Come on!

716
00:44:28,051 --> 00:44:29,851
We don't have much time!
Let's go! Move!

717
00:44:30,063 --> 00:44:31,716
I want it all! Hurry!

718
00:44:31,717 --> 00:44:32,817
This is your chance.

719
00:44:33,844 --> 00:44:34,680
I. Oh. See.

720
00:44:36,266 --> 00:44:37,927
Come on, come on,
come on, let's do this!

721
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:43,090
Gentlemen!

722
00:44:43,258 --> 00:44:45,791
Why use guns when we can
handle this like real men?

723
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:49,430
Billy, look out!

724
00:45:02,422 --> 00:45:05,108
Bullet immunity.
You have bullet immunity!

725
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,529
I'm bulletproof.

726
00:45:08,357 --> 00:45:10,460
Today is December 8th,

727
00:45:10,461 --> 00:45:12,930
and this is video proof of authenticity.

728
00:45:13,821 --> 00:45:14,821
Shoot him again.

729
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:16,559
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here, here.

730
00:45:16,607 --> 00:45:18,415
Go, both of you, come on.
Go to town.

731
00:45:25,497 --> 00:45:26,957
Wai... Wait. Wai.. Wait!

732
00:45:26,982 --> 00:45:29,982
We still don't know if the suit
is bulletproof or if you are.

733
00:45:31,911 --> 00:45:33,255
Shoot him in the face.
Shoot me in the face...

734
00:45:33,656 --> 00:45:34,530
in the face?

735
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:43,688
It kinda tickles.

736
00:45:44,988 --> 00:45:46,049
You're dead.

737
00:45:52,045 --> 00:45:53,824
Sorry about your window.
Have a good night.

738
00:45:53,949 --> 00:45:55,499
But you're welcome
for not getting robbed!

739
00:45:55,855 --> 00:45:56,895
Come on!

740
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,089
Let's get outta here!

741
00:45:59,115 --> 00:46:00,115
Hey.

742
00:46:00,488 --> 00:46:01,693
To fighting bad guys.
Yup.

743
00:46:07,384 --> 00:46:08,930
That tastes like actual vomit.

744
00:46:10,863 --> 00:46:11,915
Hey, you know,

745
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,013
habanero jerky, if you eat enough of it,

746
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:15,564
it could burn a hole in your stomach.

747
00:46:15,957 --> 00:46:17,312
Worth it.
Yeah.

748
00:46:17,537 --> 00:46:19,921
Probably not you though. You've
probably got stomach superpowers.

749
00:46:19,922 --> 00:46:20,771
Probably.

750
00:46:20,896 --> 00:46:22,608
Oh, hey, what's up?
I'm a superhero.

751
00:46:23,098 --> 00:46:24,122
Yeah, his name is...

752
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,028
Captain Sparklefingers.

753
00:46:26,053 --> 00:46:28,265
No it's not. No it's not!
It's not. It's not my name!

754
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,190
Hey, we should hang out.
We're like, the same age.

755
00:46:30,527 --> 00:46:32,154
Ho! po-po. I'm out.

756
00:46:32,311 --> 00:46:33,476
Hey, wait up!

757
00:46:40,175 --> 00:46:42,027
I mean, it's a pretty sick view.

758
00:46:42,708 --> 00:46:45,659
I totally get why Rocky was
training so hard to get up here.

759
00:46:48,161 --> 00:46:50,474
You know, I like you like this.
This is so cool.

760
00:46:51,548 --> 00:46:53,493
I mean, no offense, but like...

761
00:46:53,524 --> 00:46:56,209
Like at first, you were kinda
like the opposite of how...

762
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,980
of how Darla is.

763
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:00,829
A dick?

764
00:47:01,017 --> 00:47:02,557
Your words, not mine.

765
00:47:03,095 --> 00:47:04,239
But yeah.

766
00:47:06,178 --> 00:47:07,749
Alright, well, I feel like every criminal

767
00:47:07,774 --> 00:47:09,679
is was either on drugs
or asleep by now.

768
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:11,175
Wanna head home?

769
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:13,486
Looking like this?

770
00:47:13,757 --> 00:47:15,407
Yeah. I mean...

771
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:18,126
usually we'd have a lair
to go back to, but...

772
00:47:18,392 --> 00:47:19,689
that's long term.

773
00:47:20,201 --> 00:47:21,801
Right now you have a bunk bed.

774
00:47:26,405 --> 00:47:29,065
Just scares me thinking of
him out there all alone.

775
00:47:29,588 --> 00:47:31,248
This is what he does, Rosa.

776
00:47:32,823 --> 00:47:34,682
Difference is when they find him,

777
00:47:35,156 --> 00:47:36,841
we'll be the first to take him back.

778
00:47:37,463 --> 00:47:38,744
With open arms.

779
00:47:41,213 --> 00:47:42,840
Didn't even make it two days.

780
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:44,122
Not even two days.

781
00:47:44,123 --> 00:47:46,544
Baby, we did our fair share
of running off back when.

782
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:48,098
At least I did.

783
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:49,813
Yeah.

784
00:47:49,814 --> 00:47:51,148
Even Mary did it.

785
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,600
Twice.

786
00:47:54,691 --> 00:47:56,424
That second time she ran off,

787
00:47:56,695 --> 00:47:58,806
you said something to me
that I'll never forget.

788
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:00,568
You said.

789
00:48:00,764 --> 00:48:02,693
It's not a home till you call it a home.

790
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:04,580
It's something you choose.

791
00:48:07,544 --> 00:48:10,160
All we can do is
give him a place full of love.

792
00:48:11,295 --> 00:48:12,988
Whether he chooses to call it a home,

793
00:48:13,467 --> 00:48:14,471
that's up to him.

794
00:48:15,972 --> 00:48:16,972
Yeah.

795
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:21,127
You gonna help me with this tree?

796
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:24,413
This tree's so sad.

797
00:48:26,605 --> 00:48:27,605
Hello?

798
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:29,400
Got lost finding the bathroom.

799
00:48:30,105 --> 00:48:31,778
Oh, ok, Freddy, sweetie, goodnight!

800
00:48:32,216 --> 00:48:33,276
Good night.

801
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:36,510
Freddy, who's that?

802
00:48:36,753 --> 00:48:39,807
It's Billy, he's just... he's really
tired and he has laryngitis.

803
00:48:39,808 --> 00:48:40,748
What? What laryngitis?

804
00:48:40,749 --> 00:48:41,807
I'm just kidding! I'm just kidding.

805
00:48:41,808 --> 00:48:43,884
He's really, really tired and
he wants to go beddy-bye.

806
00:48:43,885 --> 00:48:45,772
Beddy-bye? Who says beddy-bye?
Just hide, hide.

807
00:48:46,073 --> 00:48:47,213
Billy, you're back.
Let us see you!

808
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:50,063
We're so worried about you.

809
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,612
I told you this was a bad idea!

810
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:54,250
Freddy?

811
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,120
Hey, what happened to the stairs?

812
00:48:58,922 --> 00:49:00,295
Hey, covering her mouth
like you're gonna kidnap her

813
00:49:00,296 --> 00:49:01,711
is not gonna make her less scared, ok?

814
00:49:05,021 --> 00:49:06,148
Darla it's me, it's Billy.

815
00:49:06,149 --> 00:49:08,094
I know I don't look like me.
A wizard made me look like this.

816
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,313
Maybe don't start with wizard,

817
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:10,605
it's just gonna make her more confused.

818
00:49:10,606 --> 00:49:12,294
Some old guy brought me to a temple,

819
00:49:12,295 --> 00:49:13,577
and he made me say Shazam...

820
00:49:15,245 --> 00:49:16,259
Rosa!

821
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:19,291
Verbally triggered body
manipulation properties!

822
00:49:19,516 --> 00:49:20,856
You can switch by saying Shazam!

823
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:25,265
Baby, was that you?
Are you ok?

824
00:49:27,975 --> 00:49:29,299
I was screwing in a bulb.

825
00:49:30,146 --> 00:49:32,861
Listen to me. Darla you cannot
tell anybody about this, alright?

826
00:49:32,913 --> 00:49:34,565
But it's Billy, he's a hero.

827
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:36,394
Yeah, but if a supervillain
finds out that he's a hero,

828
00:49:36,395 --> 00:49:37,635
that endangers us, ok?

829
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,260
A hero's loved ones, are like
a perfect bad guy target.

830
00:49:40,848 --> 00:49:42,375
I mean, is she even good
at keeping secrets?

831
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,740
Moderate.
No.

832
00:49:43,993 --> 00:49:44,993
Oh, God.

833
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,380
Ok, listen D.

834
00:49:46,804 --> 00:49:49,409
You cannot tell a single soul
about this alright? Please.

835
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:51,789
Why? What if it's people we trust?

836
00:49:55,227 --> 00:49:57,038
Because good sisters don't tell secrets.

837
00:49:57,515 --> 00:49:59,543
I'm a good sister.
Yeah, you are.

838
00:49:59,968 --> 00:50:01,372
You know what would make
you an even better sister?

839
00:50:01,597 --> 00:50:03,481
Is when you fix the doorknob for us, ok.
Yeah.

840
00:50:04,006 --> 00:50:05,324
Sweet dreams.
Sweet dreams, goodnight.

841
00:50:05,425 --> 00:50:06,855
See you in the morning.
Good night.

842
00:50:12,978 --> 00:50:14,278
Hello sir, how may I help you?

843
00:50:14,742 --> 00:50:15,836
Hi, sir.

844
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,986
Sir, you can't go in there.

845
00:50:18,206 --> 00:50:20,036
Excuse me!
You. You cannot go in there!

846
00:50:25,742 --> 00:50:26,765
Sorry I'm late.

847
00:50:26,766 --> 00:50:29,275
Thad, this is for board members only.

848
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,856
I'm aware of that, Father.

849
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,489
Now...

850
00:50:36,584 --> 00:50:37,370
That night...

851
00:50:38,071 --> 00:50:39,107
in the car...

852
00:50:39,794 --> 00:50:41,728
I swore to you I saw something,

853
00:50:41,729 --> 00:50:43,085
but you never believed me.

854
00:50:43,567 --> 00:50:46,107
So much easier to blame me, wasn't it?

855
00:50:47,507 --> 00:50:49,479
And say that if I hadn't screamed
that night,

856
00:50:50,142 --> 00:50:51,626
you'd still have your legs.

857
00:50:52,792 --> 00:50:54,568
But now I have proof.

858
00:50:57,696 --> 00:50:59,258
That's enough, Thad.

859
00:50:59,259 --> 00:51:00,283
Dear Sid.

860
00:51:00,985 --> 00:51:01,991
You think?

861
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,489
You know, even before the accident,

862
00:51:06,407 --> 00:51:07,535
you belittled me.

863
00:51:07,536 --> 00:51:09,754
Don't make me throw you
out of here, Thad.

864
00:51:10,659 --> 00:51:12,538
You don't need to make a scene.

865
00:51:12,972 --> 00:51:14,053
Oh brother...

866
00:51:14,203 --> 00:51:15,211
The scene,

867
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:16,858
has only just begun.

868
00:51:20,315 --> 00:51:21,915
Ask that if you can throw me out.

869
00:51:22,616 --> 00:51:23,316
What?

870
00:51:23,441 --> 00:51:25,895
Ask the ball if you're man enough
to throw me out of this room.

871
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:31,464
Let me spoil it for you.

872
00:51:39,973 --> 00:51:41,313
Outlook...

873
00:51:42,114 --> 00:51:43,309
not so good.

874
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,236
I've come here during the season of giving...

875
00:51:48,737 --> 00:51:49,699
to give you...

876
00:51:53,695 --> 00:51:55,063
what you deserve.

877
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,919
Run!

878
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:54,781
Oh, my God! No!

879
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:57,033
No! No!

880
00:53:12,482 --> 00:53:13,482
Help!

881
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,351
Somebody!

882
00:53:15,735 --> 00:53:18,004
Help me!

883
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:20,715
You can't go crying to other people
all the time.

884
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:25,578
What sin best befits you, Father?

885
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:27,789
I'll give you anything.

886
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:29,414
Money.

887
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:31,626
The company.
You want the company?

888
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:33,503
There it is.

889
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:36,406
Greed.

890
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:38,674
Do you honestly think...

891
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:43,379
all this material you've accumulated,

892
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:47,183
amounts to actual power?

893
00:53:49,769 --> 00:53:52,522
This is power.

894
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:55,717
More than you ever had.

895
00:53:56,943 --> 00:53:58,569
More than anyone has.

896
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:03,324
There is one more powerful.

897
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:07,787
The wizard found his champion.

898
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:13,501
Kill the champion
before he learns his true potential,

899
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:16,412
or he will defeat you.

900
00:54:16,796 --> 00:54:18,473
Show me where to find him.

901
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:35,148
Oh, Greed,

902
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:38,192
you can have him.

903
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:40,402
No.

904
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:43,373
No. Oh, no!

905
00:54:45,158 --> 00:54:47,910
No! No! No!

906
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:08,848
<i>Family is more than just a word.</i>

907
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:14,145
<i>At Sivana Industries,
our focus is family.</i>

908
00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:40,603
Burke.

909
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:44,017
Where's the truck?

910
00:55:53,226 --> 00:55:54,310
I can hear it.

911
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,280
Oh, my God!

912
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:07,907
My truck!

913
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,450
My truck!
Are you kidding?

914
00:56:10,618 --> 00:56:11,953
You know, guys,

915
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,397
I don't think that's gonna buff out.

916
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:24,215
Hey.

917
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:26,101
Making the crippled kid
do the dirty work.

918
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:28,928
I'm a better lookout.
I can play innocent.

919
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,263
And I can't?

920
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:34,876
Your face gives off a very strong vibe
of someone who's hatching schemes.

921
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:37,078
My face? This face?
Yeah.

922
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:38,563
Ok.

923
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:46,045
You boys got a hall pass?

924
00:56:46,696 --> 00:56:48,831
Oh, us? Yeah. Always.

925
00:56:49,699 --> 00:56:50,708
You!

926
00:56:53,494 --> 00:56:55,246
You look like you're up to something.

927
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:57,460
Me? Up to something?
No. Never.

928
00:56:57,661 --> 00:56:58,833
Am I up to something.

929
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:01,024
Our dad's picking us up. He...

930
00:57:01,325 --> 00:57:02,286
He got held up at the...

931
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:04,205
The business... office.

932
00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:05,531
The business office?

933
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,466
Sure, kid.

934
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:09,635
Look, parents or guardians

935
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:13,272
must appear physically
to check out students.

936
00:57:13,723 --> 00:57:14,782
Gotcha.

937
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:16,984
Ok well, you hear that, Dad?

938
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:18,344
Hey!
Shazam!

939
00:57:19,328 --> 00:57:20,763
Hey there, son,

940
00:57:20,846 --> 00:57:22,398
and hey there, other son
that I also have

941
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,557
that's related to that son
I just passed in the hallway.

942
00:57:24,967 --> 00:57:29,046
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I got held up at the business office,

943
00:57:29,989 --> 00:57:31,157
doing all the work stuff.

944
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,036
This is the... the security guard
all the kids admire so much.

945
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:38,043
Actually, that's the other one.
This one sucks.

946
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:40,291
This is. That's not funny.

947
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:43,361
I'm gonna talk to him about that.
I apologize.

948
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:46,380
Anyway, this is me appearing physically
to check my sons out of school.

949
00:57:46,464 --> 00:57:50,843
So, thank you so much
for keeping them safe, Detective Moron.

950
00:57:53,888 --> 00:57:55,056
It's Moran.

951
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,767
You ready?
Algebra!

952
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,011
Science!

953
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:02,196
English!

954
00:58:04,649 --> 00:58:05,741
Health!

955
00:58:39,299 --> 00:58:40,309
Are you ok?

956
00:59:17,722 --> 00:59:19,432
I'm sorry!

957
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:44,415
More powerful than a locomotive.

958
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:46,876
Locomotive.
What are you? An old prospector?

959
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:49,929
Can leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

960
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:55,217
Single bound.

961
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:00,723
I'm so sorry!

962
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:01,932
Sorry, sorry people. Hi.

963
01:00:02,316 --> 01:00:03,316
Your phone's charged.

964
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:04,467
Your phone's charged.

965
01:00:05,477 --> 01:00:06,177
Your phone's charged.

966
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:07,605
You know, you really need like a,

967
01:00:07,606 --> 01:00:09,647
like a mic drop catchphrase after
you do something cool.

968
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,025
I've been thinking about that.

969
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,443
I was thinking, what about,
what about this.

970
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:14,696
That's why you don't mess
with electricity.

971
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:17,271
Catchphrases obviously
aren't one of your superpowers.

972
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:18,908
And your phone's charged.

973
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:21,271
Well, you think you can do better?
What the hell?

974
01:00:21,494 --> 01:00:23,579
Let there be light.

975
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:28,743
Come on.
Yeah, yeah, baby. Yeah, baby, ok.

976
01:00:34,215 --> 01:00:35,674
How do I... Never mind.

977
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:36,759
Shazam!

978
01:00:40,596 --> 01:00:41,680
Shazam!

979
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,640
What'd you see?
Were there boobies?

980
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:54,893
You see nipples?
Why aren't you talking?

981
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:57,520
We're gonna need more money.

982
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:59,021
Why? You were in there for,
like, five minutes.

983
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:00,533
Dude, they were very convincing!

984
01:01:06,813 --> 01:01:07,814
Oh, get it!
That's money.

985
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:09,875
Go, go, go!

986
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:16,798
No!

987
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:18,851
Stop! No!

988
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:20,251
I'm not even looking!
Stop. Stop.

989
01:01:20,261 --> 01:01:22,555
I'm not even looking!

990
01:01:22,638 --> 01:01:24,431
Oh, and done!
What?

991
01:01:24,515 --> 01:01:25,933
Finished him.

992
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:31,355
A lair.

993
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:32,565
Yes.

994
01:01:32,648 --> 01:01:34,922
And obviously, we're gonna have to
be making this purchase anonymously.

995
01:01:35,943 --> 01:01:37,069
Obviously.

996
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:41,672
And... if you have a location like on
a cliff, like a castle-esque type thing.

997
01:01:41,866 --> 01:01:43,607
Overlooking some water.
Overlooking some water,

998
01:01:43,717 --> 01:01:45,369
seas, below it. Rough, you know...

999
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:46,662
Like a waterfall,

1000
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:49,113
so you can drive into...
Waterfall, yeah. If you... Yeah.

1001
01:01:49,123 --> 01:01:51,584
Look, maximum voltage is it?

1002
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:53,252
You can call me Max.

1003
01:01:53,836 --> 01:01:54,767
Look Max,

1004
01:01:54,768 --> 01:01:57,398
why don't you just start with how
many bedrooms you're looking for?

1005
01:01:57,481 --> 01:01:58,549
One!
Seven.

1006
01:01:58,832 --> 01:01:59,832
One?
Seven?

1007
01:01:59,884 --> 01:02:01,364
What, am I running a foster home now?

1008
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,472
Have you seen the one
where he throws the football into space?

1009
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:16,482
So dope.

1010
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:18,525
Hey, you guys gotta wonder
who's filming those, right?

1011
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:20,063
I mean, that's bravery in
and of itself.

1012
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:22,156
I mean, is it, though?

1013
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,533
Yeah. I'd actually argue
maybe even more brave.

1014
01:02:24,617 --> 01:02:25,618
Holding a camera?

1015
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,621
Staring in the face of danger.

1016
01:02:28,704 --> 01:02:30,380
Like some weirdo fanboy.

1017
01:02:31,707 --> 01:02:32,875
Hey, Freeman.

1018
01:02:33,058 --> 01:02:34,819
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1019
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:37,505
What, is your bestie gonna hit us
with a wheelchair this time?

1020
01:02:37,788 --> 01:02:39,580
No, maybe not him,
but I have another best friend,

1021
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:41,770
who might hunt you down
and destroy both of you.

1022
01:02:42,134 --> 01:02:43,260
Ok, Freddy.

1023
01:02:43,344 --> 01:02:44,364
You may have heard of him.

1024
01:02:45,165 --> 01:02:46,397
The Human Power Storm.

1025
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,633
Frequency Flinger. Sir Zaps-A-Lot.

1026
01:02:49,016 --> 01:02:50,668
Yeah. He's a man of many names.

1027
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:52,019
You know the Red Cyclone?

1028
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:52,908
You?

1029
01:02:53,609 --> 01:02:54,955
My ass you do.

1030
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:56,574
We're a lot closer than you think.

1031
01:02:56,857 --> 01:02:58,717
Maybe even at this very moment.

1032
01:02:58,901 --> 01:02:59,910
Prove it.

1033
01:02:59,911 --> 01:03:00,911
I will tomorrow.

1034
01:03:00,972 --> 01:03:02,972
Tomorrow he's gonna come
to lunch, and...

1035
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:04,290
Rig... Right, Billy?

1036
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:07,173
Oh, yeah, and then Superman's
gonna be bringing us dessert, right?

1037
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:11,845
Tomorrow at lunch. You'll see.

1038
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:13,351
And when he doesn't show,

1039
01:03:13,652 --> 01:03:15,501
then, we'll kick your ass.

1040
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:21,590
So wait, my identity's a secret
so no one I know can get hurt.

1041
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:25,135
Except when it makes you look cool,
then, then it's all good.

1042
01:03:25,419 --> 01:03:26,752
Billy, it's not like they're supervillains.

1043
01:03:26,762 --> 01:03:28,164
They're just super douchebags.

1044
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:30,883
So, you're breaking your own rule?

1045
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:32,267
Got it.

1046
01:03:33,102 --> 01:03:35,229
This thing is as much as mine
as it is yours.

1047
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:38,983
Sorry, I'm starting to think you
think it's all your thing.

1048
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:41,260
Billy, you're still gonna do it,
though, right?

1049
01:03:41,944 --> 01:03:43,446
I mean, what would a good brother do?

1050
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:46,814
All hands on deck.

1051
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:51,855
Thank you for this family.

1052
01:03:51,856 --> 01:03:53,339
Thank you for this day.

1053
01:03:53,522 --> 01:03:54,606
Thank you for this food.

1054
01:03:54,907 --> 01:03:56,801
Sorry Billy's hand's on vacay.

1055
01:04:01,088 --> 01:04:02,233
Big news in Philly.

1056
01:04:02,234 --> 01:04:03,465
They found a costumed hero.

1057
01:04:04,049 --> 01:04:05,053
He's doing good.

1058
01:04:05,492 --> 01:04:07,077
Yeah, but is he, though?

1059
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,264
Controversy. Into it.

1060
01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:12,926
Share with us your,
perspective Eugene.

1061
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:15,285
Just saying, he's what?

1062
01:04:15,286 --> 01:04:16,687
Charging people's phones?

1063
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:17,548
So what?

1064
01:04:17,549 --> 01:04:19,606
I can charge a phone, with a plug.

1065
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:20,749
Preach.

1066
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:23,510
Pedro, any thoughts?

1067
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,755
Costume's stupid.

1068
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:27,431
Yeah.
Ok.

1069
01:04:27,614 --> 01:04:29,742
Big white cape like
he's getting married or something.

1070
01:04:30,025 --> 01:04:32,077
What if he didn't get to pick his costume?

1071
01:04:32,161 --> 01:04:34,029
Ever think about that?

1072
01:04:34,413 --> 01:04:36,253
You're a specialist, Freddy.
What do you think?

1073
01:04:36,431 --> 01:04:37,591
Yeah Freddy let's...

1074
01:04:37,892 --> 01:04:40,035
manage to see the positive.

1075
01:04:40,219 --> 01:04:42,037
Ok, well I think it looks like...

1076
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:44,421
he doesn't have gratitude
for what he's been given.

1077
01:04:44,757 --> 01:04:46,992
Very specific. Alright.

1078
01:04:47,176 --> 01:04:48,427
Maybe to the superhero,

1079
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,190
gratitude doesn't mean
having to be clingy.

1080
01:04:50,462 --> 01:04:51,738
Clingy? Interesting take.

1081
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:54,307
Maybe sometimes a superhero just...

1082
01:04:54,608 --> 01:04:55,976
wants a little me time.

1083
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:59,188
You know me time, could also
be construed as pushing away his family.

1084
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:01,231
Family, is that what they are now?

1085
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:03,400
It's a classic symptom of
Superhero Syndrome.

1086
01:05:03,484 --> 01:05:06,116
Coined by German psychologist
Heinrich Von...

1087
01:05:06,417 --> 01:05:07,661
German something where,

1088
01:05:07,662 --> 01:05:09,932
superpowers become
an all-consuming narcotic.

1089
01:05:12,217 --> 01:05:13,677
Son, we're still eating dinner.

1090
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,412
What he needs is a sidekick.

1091
01:05:15,596 --> 01:05:17,139
Name one cool sidekick.

1092
01:05:18,207 --> 01:05:20,175
Darla, why are you
so quiet over there, baby?

1093
01:05:20,459 --> 01:05:22,344
You're never at a loss for words.

1094
01:05:22,628 --> 01:05:24,113
I'm eating.

1095
01:05:35,015 --> 01:05:36,615
Why am I still doing this?

1096
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:39,336
Billy, you can't skip every day.

1097
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,720
Not at your age.

1098
01:05:41,647 --> 01:05:43,107
But I'm not your age anymore.

1099
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,515
But, I can go with you.
We just gotta...

1100
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:47,378
trick the guard out, you know, and then...

1101
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:49,138
Billy, where are you going?
Billy...

1102
01:05:49,822 --> 01:05:51,230
You're still gonna have
lunch with me, right?

1103
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,299
Billy!

1104
01:05:52,741 --> 01:05:55,620
Sir Zaps-A-Lot's still gonna eat
in the cafeteria, right?

1105
01:06:05,921 --> 01:06:06,948
Alright.

1106
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:08,866
Did you check it to...

1107
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:11,923
People typically like give me
a little money, you know...

1108
01:06:12,624 --> 01:06:13,324
to...

1109
01:06:13,345 --> 01:06:15,356
You're a sweet couple.
You guys have a good day.

1110
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:28,783
Oh, my God.
Mary?

1111
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:29,945
Mary, are you ok? Are you...

1112
01:06:30,487 --> 01:06:31,447
How do you know my name?

1113
01:06:32,213 --> 01:06:33,657
How do I know your name?

1114
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:36,269
One of my superpowers
is name guessing.

1115
01:06:37,411 --> 01:06:39,229
Which is really weird, I bet.

1116
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:41,957
It's not as cool as
super-strength or super-speed but,

1117
01:06:41,958 --> 01:06:43,668
it's really helpful when
I meet new people.

1118
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:45,669
Are you hurt?

1119
01:06:46,295 --> 01:06:47,717
No, I'm...

1120
01:06:47,718 --> 01:06:49,908
I'm ok. Thank you.
I...

1121
01:06:51,967 --> 01:06:53,528
I just need a second to think.

1122
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:56,054
This has been such a weird day.

1123
01:06:56,889 --> 01:07:00,434
Using my powers of super-observation,

1124
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:02,579
I see that you're holding a letter
from a college,

1125
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:06,207
in your hand. Are you upset
because you didn't get in?

1126
01:07:10,152 --> 01:07:11,111
I got in.

1127
01:07:14,339 --> 01:07:17,468
Well, now my superpowers
are failing me and I am very confused.

1128
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,304
Yeah. Me, too.

1129
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:23,197
I don't know. I know I should be excited

1130
01:07:23,207 --> 01:07:26,018
because this is my dream and
I've worked really, really hard for this,

1131
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:28,420
but it's like...

1132
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:33,592
I don't know. Leaving my family
does not feel fun, you know?

1133
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:36,462
Can I. Can I. Can I give you
a little piece of advice?

1134
01:07:36,845 --> 01:07:40,357
Don't be worried about everybody else.
Always look out for number one.

1135
01:07:40,641 --> 01:07:41,600
Gandhi said that.

1136
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:43,518
I don't think he said that.
Yeah, he did.

1137
01:07:43,702 --> 01:07:45,385
Gandhi did not say that.
Somebody like Gandhi said that.

1138
01:07:45,395 --> 01:07:46,345
Take care of number one.

1139
01:07:46,355 --> 01:07:48,440
It was a really wise...
It might have been Yoda.

1140
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:49,608
Listen.
I'm sorry, no.

1141
01:07:49,891 --> 01:07:51,669
Agree to disagree. The point is...

1142
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:53,961
you do you. You know,
you gotta look out for you.

1143
01:07:54,162 --> 01:07:56,481
And get as far away from
this place as you can.

1144
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,202
I don't know if I want to.

1145
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:01,870
Of course you do.
What're you gonna do?

1146
01:08:01,954 --> 01:08:03,694
You gonna live in a group home
for the rest of your life?

1147
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:08,505
Look, families are for people who
can't take care of themselves, ok?

1148
01:08:08,906 --> 01:08:09,778
So...

1149
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:12,839
You know, you can take care of yourself.
All you know...

1150
01:08:13,023 --> 01:08:14,783
Also, look both ways
when you cross the street.

1151
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:21,974
I'll just call him. I'll just make sure.

1152
01:08:25,158 --> 01:08:26,333
It's ringing.

1153
01:08:28,812 --> 01:08:30,804
Red Cyclone! Hey!
Hey, what's going on?

1154
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,542
Oh, that's crazy.
Yeah, it's Freddy, by the way.

1155
01:08:33,667 --> 01:08:34,823
Yeah, it's crazy.
That is...

1156
01:08:34,824 --> 01:08:35,837
Great story.

1157
01:08:37,016 --> 01:08:38,278
He's not talking.

1158
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:41,669
I was! I was!

1159
01:08:41,799 --> 01:08:43,371
We're friends.
I know him. I do.

1160
01:08:43,674 --> 01:08:44,883
I know him! I know him!

1161
01:08:45,184 --> 01:08:45,920
Yeah.

1162
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:50,402
Shit.

1163
01:08:54,699 --> 01:08:55,873
Come on, now.

1164
01:08:56,096 --> 01:08:58,888
<i>♪ Hands. Lightning with my hands. ♪</i>

1165
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:00,939
<i>♪ Lightning with my hands. ♪</i>

1166
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:03,618
<i>♪ Lightning with my hands. ♪</i>

1167
01:09:03,643 --> 01:09:05,078
Hey! Hey!

1168
01:09:05,542 --> 01:09:06,820
Hey, young man.

1169
01:09:08,035 --> 01:09:09,633
What are you doing?
I'm in the middle of a show right now.

1170
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:10,945
How can I help you?

1171
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:13,299
I just wanted to say thank you
for showing up to lunch today.

1172
01:09:13,964 --> 01:09:17,225
Yeah, I got a little something
called a suitcase wedgie, right?

1173
01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:18,924
I don't know if you've ever
heard of it, but it's when...

1174
01:09:19,149 --> 01:09:21,160
someone grabs your
underwear like that

1175
01:09:21,285 --> 01:09:22,391
and hold you like a suitcase,

1176
01:09:22,516 --> 01:09:23,606
walks you down the hallway.

1177
01:09:24,031 --> 01:09:25,070
And this...

1178
01:09:25,371 --> 01:09:26,401
was my underwear.

1179
01:09:29,010 --> 01:09:30,010
Gross.

1180
01:09:30,567 --> 01:09:31,576
You said you'd come.

1181
01:09:31,801 --> 01:09:33,837
You said I will come,
I never said I was...

1182
01:09:34,127 --> 01:09:35,667
I'm a superhero, dude.

1183
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:37,198
Well, you're acting real heroic.

1184
01:09:37,421 --> 01:09:38,992
How much people paying you today?

1185
01:09:39,294 --> 01:09:42,511
Listen, I have serious
responsibilities now, ok?

1186
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:45,045
But that's cool, because I can
carry that burden with my...

1187
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:47,692
<i>♪ hands. Lightning with my hands. ♪</i>

1188
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:08,180
Oh man!

1189
01:10:13,781 --> 01:10:14,859
Holy moly.

1190
01:10:17,226 --> 01:10:18,475
Don't move!

1191
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,689
Nobody move!

1192
01:10:28,639 --> 01:10:29,669
Oh, no.

1193
01:10:30,099 --> 01:10:31,695
No, no, no, no, no.
Stay, stay.

1194
01:10:31,798 --> 01:10:33,525
Stay. Stay. Stay.

1195
01:10:43,446 --> 01:10:44,869
That looked like it hurts.

1196
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:46,170
It's him!

1197
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:48,008
It's that superhero guy!

1198
01:10:48,954 --> 01:10:50,121
Help us! Save us!

1199
01:10:50,962 --> 01:10:51,762
Come on.

1200
01:10:54,008 --> 01:10:55,008
Come...

1201
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:58,801
What's he doing?
What's going on?

1202
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:09,148
What? No way.

1203
01:11:16,637 --> 01:11:18,883
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.
Please don't make me do this.

1204
01:11:19,213 --> 01:11:20,811
God, That is the worst idea ever!

1205
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:34,086
I did it!
I did it!

1206
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:36,477
I got the bus!
I got the bus.

1207
01:11:36,871 --> 01:11:38,093
Nobody move in there!

1208
01:11:38,396 --> 01:11:40,325
I gotta put this thing down,
I gotta put this thing down.

1209
01:11:46,311 --> 01:11:48,719
No, no, no, doggie, doggie,
you have to move. Move!

1210
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:49,594
Move! Shoo!

1211
01:11:49,595 --> 01:11:50,194
Shoo!

1212
01:11:50,219 --> 01:11:52,051
Please be a good dog.
Good dog!

1213
01:11:52,076 --> 01:11:53,633
You're being a bad dog.

1214
01:11:53,758 --> 01:11:54,987
Go! Go!

1215
01:11:55,909 --> 01:11:57,280
Please go. Please move.

1216
01:11:58,421 --> 01:12:00,310
Yes, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1217
01:12:00,841 --> 01:12:01,860
Thank you.

1218
01:12:17,993 --> 01:12:19,017
Yeah.

1219
01:12:19,214 --> 01:12:21,159
Yeah, no, no, no, my f...

1220
01:12:21,291 --> 01:12:23,420
I was in the neighborhood,
you know, so I thought...

1221
01:12:23,545 --> 01:12:24,445
Thank you.
We both...

1222
01:12:24,449 --> 01:12:26,519
Oh yeah you know,
it's kinda my fault, anyway.

1223
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:32,875
So, it seems Philadelphia has
gotten an early Christmas present

1224
01:12:32,909 --> 01:12:36,453
in the form of its very own superhero.

1225
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,296
And we're out.

1226
01:12:38,661 --> 01:12:40,534
Hey, thank you very much.
Of course, yeah.

1227
01:12:40,559 --> 01:12:42,901
Dude! Dude, dude!
Dude, did you see that?

1228
01:12:43,134 --> 01:12:46,325
Yeah, you electrocuted a bus
and almost killed these people.

1229
01:12:46,503 --> 01:12:48,188
And then I caught it!

1230
01:12:48,539 --> 01:12:51,944
Freddy! I caught a bus
with my bare hands, man!

1231
01:12:51,969 --> 01:12:54,297
I caught a bus like people
catch fly balls, like...

1232
01:12:54,321 --> 01:12:55,590
Who does that? I do that.

1233
01:12:55,615 --> 01:12:57,275
Billy, you do nothing, you...

1234
01:12:57,547 --> 01:12:59,782
you take selfies
and make people pay you.

1235
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,934
You know forget it. I can't really
talk to you when you look like this.

1236
01:13:03,726 --> 01:13:05,183
You just wish it was you.

1237
01:13:05,984 --> 01:13:07,027
No shit.

1238
01:13:07,732 --> 01:13:08,779
You think?

1239
01:13:08,804 --> 01:13:10,867
I would kill to have what you have.

1240
01:13:11,475 --> 01:13:13,038
Because everything I do,

1241
01:13:13,102 --> 01:13:16,478
is like some, some desperate attempt
to get people to notice me.

1242
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:18,394
To not feel sorry for me.

1243
01:13:18,514 --> 01:13:19,914
I mean, look at me.
Look at me.

1244
01:13:20,014 --> 01:13:21,414
Do you even see me?

1245
01:13:21,866 --> 01:13:23,466
Because most people don't.

1246
01:13:24,345 --> 01:13:25,710
Because they don't want to.

1247
01:13:26,507 --> 01:13:27,807
And you don't either.

1248
01:13:28,812 --> 01:13:30,512
I mean, you think this is who you are?

1249
01:13:31,067 --> 01:13:32,629
I mean Billy you're 14.

1250
01:13:32,654 --> 01:13:34,440
And now you're no better
than the Breyers.

1251
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,554
All this power,

1252
01:13:36,801 --> 01:13:39,769
and all you did was turn
into a show-off and a bully.

1253
01:13:42,321 --> 01:13:43,448
Whatever, kid.

1254
01:13:43,536 --> 01:13:44,956
I do what I want!

1255
01:13:46,728 --> 01:13:49,129
And I'm like mid-20s, probably.

1256
01:13:50,104 --> 01:13:51,651
Maybe even like 30.

1257
01:13:55,394 --> 01:13:56,659
Chosen one.

1258
01:14:00,273 --> 01:14:02,373
The so-called perfect man.

1259
01:14:03,825 --> 01:14:05,126
Pure of heart.

1260
01:14:06,348 --> 01:14:08,174
Flawless in every way.

1261
01:14:10,751 --> 01:14:12,394
What made you so worthy?

1262
01:14:12,508 --> 01:14:14,082
I'm sorry, can I help?

1263
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:14,692
Can I help?

1264
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,319
Do you want a autograph or something?

1265
01:14:16,344 --> 01:14:17,778
Give me your power.

1266
01:14:20,111 --> 01:14:21,217
Or die.

1267
01:14:21,565 --> 01:14:22,873
Oh, snap.

1268
01:14:23,544 --> 01:14:24,941
You're like a bad guy, right?

1269
01:14:24,983 --> 01:14:25,997
Ok, ok, ok, ok.

1270
01:14:26,022 --> 01:14:28,138
Look, before this gets really
stupid for you,

1271
01:14:28,318 --> 01:14:30,394
you should know that
I'm basically invincible.

1272
01:14:30,395 --> 01:14:31,095
So wou kno...

1273
01:14:39,065 --> 01:14:41,761
The weapons of man draw
no blood from our kind.

1274
01:14:41,786 --> 01:14:42,686
This is the...

1275
01:14:44,385 --> 01:14:46,696
The only thing that extinguishes
is magic,

1276
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,565
is magic.

1277
01:14:49,962 --> 01:14:52,277
Time to transfer your power to me.

1278
01:14:55,519 --> 01:14:58,411
You did not see that one coming,
did you grandpa?

1279
01:14:58,796 --> 01:15:00,264
Them's street rules!

1280
01:15:09,735 --> 01:15:11,052
Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok!

1281
01:15:11,077 --> 01:15:12,943
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1282
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:15,304
I never should've punched
you in the nuts like that.

1283
01:15:15,305 --> 01:15:16,428
That was totally my bad.

1284
01:15:16,592 --> 01:15:17,601
We can talk about this.

1285
01:15:17,629 --> 01:15:18,902
You grovel like a child.

1286
01:15:19,037 --> 01:15:21,298
That's because I am one.
I'm a kid.

1287
01:15:21,423 --> 01:15:22,823
You don't want to hurt a kid, do you?

1288
01:15:25,676 --> 01:15:26,795
I believe I can fly!

1289
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,741
I believe I can fly!
I can fly!

1290
01:15:28,766 --> 01:15:29,875
Freddy said if I believe, I can fly!

1291
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:31,455
Then I can fly, so I believe!

1292
01:15:31,544 --> 01:15:32,774
I believe, I believe!

1293
01:15:33,024 --> 01:15:34,556
Ok! Superman!

1294
01:15:34,681 --> 01:15:36,784
Superman!
What arm is it?

1295
01:15:36,854 --> 01:15:38,346
Why am I not flying?

1296
01:15:38,371 --> 01:15:40,234
Please, I don't wanna die!

1297
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:04,298
I'm floating!

1298
01:16:11,443 --> 01:16:12,844
What the hell was that?

1299
01:16:17,416 --> 01:16:18,789
I can fly!

1300
01:16:25,338 --> 01:16:26,338
Billy?

1301
01:16:27,526 --> 01:16:29,311
Freddy! I need your help!

1302
01:16:29,386 --> 01:16:30,664
You can fly?

1303
01:16:38,757 --> 01:16:40,082
Who's the other guy?

1304
01:16:40,386 --> 01:16:41,706
Santa!

1305
01:16:44,865 --> 01:16:48,585
So, like, what do you and Mrs. Claus
do in the summertime?

1306
01:16:49,049 --> 01:16:51,310
Well, in some ways,

1307
01:16:51,453 --> 01:16:53,426
Santa's always here for you.

1308
01:16:58,671 --> 01:16:59,674
Help! Help!

1309
01:17:00,265 --> 01:17:01,638
Help Santa!

1310
01:17:01,967 --> 01:17:03,864
Help Santa! Needs help!

1311
01:17:04,165 --> 01:17:04,818
Help!

1312
01:17:04,919 --> 01:17:06,084
Give us a shout if you need us.

1313
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:15,742
I'm just gonna chill in here for
a little while, if that's ok.

1314
01:17:19,629 --> 01:17:20,629
This is crazy!

1315
01:17:21,075 --> 01:17:22,647
This is crazy.
You don't have to fight this guy.

1316
01:17:22,648 --> 01:17:24,394
This isn't your job.
You can run, right?

1317
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:26,854
Yes! You can run. Awesome.

1318
01:17:27,555 --> 01:17:28,255
You!

1319
01:17:35,213 --> 01:17:36,435
Get back!

1320
01:17:36,699 --> 01:17:38,389
Just get... Get away!

1321
01:17:40,046 --> 01:17:42,125
<i>I'm Batman.</i>
Get him, Batman!

1322
01:18:12,181 --> 01:18:13,348
Oh, sorry.
Come on!

1323
01:18:39,266 --> 01:18:41,018
Sh... Shazam!

1324
01:19:11,594 --> 01:19:12,394
Billy!

1325
01:19:13,741 --> 01:19:14,741
Billy!

1326
01:19:16,359 --> 01:19:17,505
Billy, where are you?

1327
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:21,352
Billy!

1328
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:24,090
Where are you, Billy?

1329
01:19:28,636 --> 01:19:29,979
Billy, come on!

1330
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:34,202
Billy.

1331
01:19:35,196 --> 01:19:35,859
Where is he?

1332
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,226
Supervillain.

1333
01:19:37,797 --> 01:19:39,643
Supervillain! Supervillain!

1334
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:41,976
Worse.

1335
01:19:42,763 --> 01:19:43,793
Much worse.

1336
01:19:44,143 --> 01:19:45,508
Radioactive anthromorph.

1337
01:19:45,748 --> 01:19:47,157
Psychic energy manipulator.

1338
01:19:47,953 --> 01:19:49,006
I won't let you read my mind.

1339
01:19:49,007 --> 01:19:50,858
My mind is blank.
You can't get in.

1340
01:19:51,283 --> 01:19:52,612
I don't need to read your mind.

1341
01:19:53,485 --> 01:19:55,162
Because you are going to tell me.

1342
01:19:56,075 --> 01:19:57,256
Where is he?

1343
01:20:09,796 --> 01:20:10,838
Oh, my God, are you ok?

1344
01:20:12,376 --> 01:20:13,384
You ok?

1345
01:20:13,385 --> 01:20:13,906
Yeah.

1346
01:20:13,907 --> 01:20:14,932
What happened?
Are you hurt?

1347
01:20:15,330 --> 01:20:16,381
Come inside.

1348
01:20:16,592 --> 01:20:17,766
We need to have a talk.

1349
01:20:19,215 --> 01:20:20,550
Just don't be too hard on him, ok?

1350
01:20:27,306 --> 01:20:28,816
Running out on us.

1351
01:20:28,817 --> 01:20:29,854
Lying.

1352
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:31,422
Then I get a call from the school

1353
01:20:31,447 --> 01:20:33,167
telling me you've been cutting class.

1354
01:20:33,624 --> 01:20:34,701
Getting in fights.

1355
01:20:38,684 --> 01:20:40,684
<i>Bill, the man saved nine people.</i>

1356
01:20:41,985 --> 01:20:42,921
Is that?

1357
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:45,322
<i>I'm questioning his motive.</i>

1358
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:47,441
What's Freddy doing with a superhero?

1359
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:54,062
What's this superhero doing with Freddy?

1360
01:20:57,735 --> 01:20:58,940
You remember dinner?

1361
01:20:59,165 --> 01:21:01,196
When Billy and Freddy were arguing,

1362
01:21:01,263 --> 01:21:02,993
like an old married couple like this?

1363
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:06,904
When he rescued me,
he knew I lived in a group home.

1364
01:21:07,036 --> 01:21:08,792
He knew my name.
He called me Mary.

1365
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:18,581
Wait.

1366
01:21:18,685 --> 01:21:20,989
Are you saying Billy's
the Human Power Storm?

1367
01:21:21,139 --> 01:21:22,964
Yes! You guys figured it out!

1368
01:21:23,038 --> 01:21:24,632
All on your own.
I didn't help.

1369
01:21:24,657 --> 01:21:25,935
I didn't break any promises.

1370
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,030
You knew?

1371
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:28,605
I'm a good sister!

1372
01:21:33,011 --> 01:21:34,408
I mean, what were you thinking?

1373
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:37,010
And then you bring Freddy into it.

1374
01:21:43,229 --> 01:21:45,742
Give him some space, guys.
He's a little upset. Ok?

1375
01:21:56,255 --> 01:21:57,155
Billy?

1376
01:22:02,437 --> 01:22:03,555
You're him.

1377
01:22:04,818 --> 01:22:06,047
You're the hero.

1378
01:22:07,410 --> 01:22:09,591
Yeah, well not anymore so...

1379
01:22:13,906 --> 01:22:15,647
Why do you have my notebook?

1380
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:20,145
Eugene finished you search.

1381
01:22:21,108 --> 01:22:23,114
Look, I'm not a hacker, ok?

1382
01:22:23,547 --> 01:22:25,991
But I have played Watchdogs and Uplink.

1383
01:22:26,057 --> 01:22:28,091
And maybe I did pick up a few skills,

1384
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:30,304
which maybe did get me
into federal databases

1385
01:22:30,329 --> 01:22:31,550
most people can't get into, but...

1386
01:22:31,617 --> 01:22:33,317
Good for you, but I'm gonna go.

1387
01:22:33,771 --> 01:22:36,853
Your parents' names
are Marilyn and C.C. Batson.

1388
01:22:42,473 --> 01:22:43,473
What?

1389
01:22:43,728 --> 01:22:45,673
You were born in Zumbrota, Minnesota.

1390
01:22:45,969 --> 01:22:47,644
They divorced when you were three.

1391
01:22:47,892 --> 01:22:49,292
Your mom moved here that year.

1392
01:22:49,576 --> 01:22:51,254
20 months later, you got lost.

1393
01:22:51,885 --> 01:22:54,285
You never found them because
your dad's been in prison,

1394
01:22:54,362 --> 01:22:55,785
in Florida for 10 years.

1395
01:22:56,086 --> 01:22:57,243
And your mom's...

1396
01:22:58,840 --> 01:22:59,840
What?

1397
01:23:01,827 --> 01:23:02,914
Is she dead?

1398
01:23:03,529 --> 01:23:05,357
She's two subway stops away.

1399
01:23:06,541 --> 01:23:07,541
What?

1400
01:23:08,576 --> 01:23:09,583
You know, you didn't find her

1401
01:23:09,608 --> 01:23:11,579
because she reverted
to her maiden name.

1402
01:23:16,139 --> 01:23:16,945
Hey, Billy!

1403
01:23:17,446 --> 01:23:18,446
Billy!

1404
01:23:22,248 --> 01:23:23,184
Victor, get the keys.
I got it.

1405
01:23:23,509 --> 01:23:25,483
Kids, stay here in case Billy comes back.

1406
01:23:33,645 --> 01:23:35,011
Come on. Inside, let's go.

1407
01:23:43,730 --> 01:23:44,709
Wait.

1408
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:46,542
I thought we were running after Billy?

1409
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:49,024
No, we're gonna wait here for now.

1410
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:53,890
Billy?

1411
01:23:56,942 --> 01:23:57,942
Freddy?

1412
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:04,037
How quaint.

1413
01:24:07,445 --> 01:24:08,976
Actually, I take that back.

1414
01:24:11,341 --> 01:24:12,668
What a shithole.

1415
01:24:56,449 --> 01:24:57,719
Just a second.

1416
01:25:02,358 --> 01:25:04,266
Hey, look, I'm late for work
already, alright?

1417
01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:06,125
We don't need any
magazines or whatever.

1418
01:25:06,126 --> 01:25:07,662
Oh, I'm not.
Thanks, though.

1419
01:25:08,775 --> 01:25:10,590
You probably don't recognize me but...

1420
01:25:12,817 --> 01:25:14,372
I found my way home.

1421
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,536
Mom.

1422
01:25:18,467 --> 01:25:19,502
It's me.

1423
01:25:20,977 --> 01:25:22,016
Oh, God.

1424
01:25:23,617 --> 01:25:24,617
Is it?

1425
01:25:28,352 --> 01:25:29,277
Hang on.

1426
01:25:30,847 --> 01:25:31,924
Who's at the door?

1427
01:25:33,371 --> 01:25:34,371
It's...

1428
01:25:35,212 --> 01:25:36,982
It's no one, Travis.

1429
01:25:41,867 --> 01:25:43,367
That wasn't Dad, was it?

1430
01:25:44,434 --> 01:25:45,448
No, I...

1431
01:25:46,462 --> 01:25:47,588
Listen...

1432
01:25:48,289 --> 01:25:49,292
it's...

1433
01:25:51,173 --> 01:25:52,347
It's really you?

1434
01:25:54,811 --> 01:25:56,374
I didn't mean to run away.

1435
01:25:57,247 --> 01:25:58,541
You know that, right?

1436
01:25:59,245 --> 01:26:01,919
I let go but it was by accident, I...

1437
01:26:02,031 --> 01:26:03,621
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

1438
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:06,228
I saw you.

1439
01:26:07,141 --> 01:26:08,149
What?

1440
01:26:11,526 --> 01:26:13,101
I saw you after.

1441
01:26:15,786 --> 01:26:18,476
So, it was never your fault.

1442
01:26:20,020 --> 01:26:21,725
I was 17.

1443
01:26:22,483 --> 01:26:24,189
And my dad, he kicked me out.

1444
01:26:24,564 --> 01:26:26,040
And your dad just...

1445
01:26:26,676 --> 01:26:28,948
decided not to be a part of anything.

1446
01:26:29,793 --> 01:26:31,066
You know it was hurting,

1447
01:26:31,367 --> 01:26:32,553
and I was screwed up.

1448
01:26:35,313 --> 01:26:38,023
I wanted the tiger.
I know, I know, honey but...

1449
01:26:38,429 --> 01:26:40,729
Mom's not exactly going pro here, ok?

1450
01:26:43,617 --> 01:26:44,637
Billy?

1451
01:26:45,483 --> 01:26:46,483
Billy!

1452
01:26:47,557 --> 01:26:48,557
Billy!

1453
01:26:49,232 --> 01:26:51,510
Jesus Christ, Billy, this isn't funny!

1454
01:26:52,234 --> 01:26:53,234
Here you go, buddy.

1455
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:56,670
That should warm you up.
Is that better?

1456
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:00,544
Look, it's just once

1457
01:27:00,945 --> 01:27:02,307
I saw you with the police,

1458
01:27:02,512 --> 01:27:03,927
I realized that...

1459
01:27:04,238 --> 01:27:07,466
they could do a better job taking
care of you than I ever will.

1460
01:27:12,835 --> 01:27:14,327
But you're good, right?

1461
01:27:16,003 --> 01:27:17,910
I mean you landed on your feet.

1462
01:27:19,085 --> 01:27:20,561
Because I mean you look real good.

1463
01:27:23,266 --> 01:27:24,418
It's just...

1464
01:27:26,570 --> 01:27:29,617
Now is not a really good time
for me, Billy.

1465
01:27:34,110 --> 01:27:36,037
All I wanted to do is...

1466
01:27:37,599 --> 01:27:39,464
let you know I'm doing good but...

1467
01:27:40,894 --> 01:27:43,424
I have to get back
to my real family, so.

1468
01:27:45,768 --> 01:27:46,958
Here.

1469
01:27:50,606 --> 01:27:51,716
What's this?

1470
01:27:52,386 --> 01:27:54,525
Marilyn! What's going on out there?

1471
01:27:55,791 --> 01:27:57,394
You might need it more than me.

1472
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:16,610
Freddy, you were right.

1473
01:28:16,911 --> 01:28:18,094
Sorry I yelled at you.

1474
01:28:18,247 --> 01:28:19,430
<i>Come home, Billy.</i>

1475
01:28:20,378 --> 01:28:21,623
<i>Come home.</i>

1476
01:28:21,990 --> 01:28:24,640
<i>Billy! Supervillain!
Supervillain!</i>

1477
01:28:41,693 --> 01:28:42,701
Shazam!

1478
01:28:56,636 --> 01:28:57,702
Who are you?

1479
01:28:57,903 --> 01:28:58,961
What do you want?

1480
01:28:59,153 --> 01:29:00,350
What do I want?

1481
01:29:01,449 --> 01:29:02,595
I want...

1482
01:29:07,715 --> 01:29:08,715
That.

1483
01:29:14,778 --> 01:29:15,988
Kick his ass, Billy!

1484
01:29:18,923 --> 01:29:19,931
Oh, God.

1485
01:29:19,956 --> 01:29:20,967
Yes, Billy.

1486
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:22,807
Try it, by all means.

1487
01:29:23,403 --> 01:29:24,846
Let them go and I'll come inside.

1488
01:29:25,385 --> 01:29:27,304
No, first you come inside,

1489
01:29:27,568 --> 01:29:29,296
then maybe I'll let them go.

1490
01:29:46,295 --> 01:29:47,371
Good boy.

1491
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:52,040
Because that's all you are, isn't it?

1492
01:29:53,049 --> 01:29:54,266
How old are you?

1493
01:29:54,644 --> 01:29:55,973
Basically, 15.

1494
01:29:58,833 --> 01:30:00,252
When I was a child,

1495
01:30:00,548 --> 01:30:02,651
the old man told me
I wasn't good enough.

1496
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:03,943
And here you are,

1497
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:05,816
a coward.

1498
01:30:06,777 --> 01:30:08,078
Run from me,

1499
01:30:08,625 --> 01:30:10,847
and that wizard chooses you?
You're not a hero.

1500
01:30:11,357 --> 01:30:14,091
But I'm gonna give you
the opportunity to be one.

1501
01:30:14,827 --> 01:30:16,636
Give me the power of a champion.

1502
01:30:16,774 --> 01:30:18,037
No, don't do it, Billy!

1503
01:30:35,007 --> 01:30:36,133
Give me the power,

1504
01:30:36,827 --> 01:30:37,874
and I'll let them go.

1505
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:39,128
Darla, no.

1506
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:40,700
Don't, don't go, Billy!

1507
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:42,972
Don't go! Don't go, Billy!

1508
01:30:43,267 --> 01:30:45,122
No, no, I have to, I have to, it's...

1509
01:30:45,653 --> 01:30:47,253
It's what a good brother would do...

1510
01:30:47,654 --> 01:30:48,669
Right?

1511
01:30:53,304 --> 01:30:54,304
Billy.

1512
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:23,499
I dedicated my life to getting here.

1513
01:31:24,775 --> 01:31:26,080
I scoured the earth.

1514
01:31:26,727 --> 01:31:28,185
No one believed me.

1515
01:31:29,138 --> 01:31:30,241
No one helped.

1516
01:31:31,226 --> 01:31:32,226
Not the wizard.

1517
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:34,793
Not my family.

1518
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:38,330
I only had myself.

1519
01:31:39,187 --> 01:31:40,206
I get it.

1520
01:31:41,743 --> 01:31:42,992
I get what that's like.

1521
01:31:45,178 --> 01:31:46,861
Feeling like you're all alone in the world.

1522
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,120
Stand.

1523
01:31:48,735 --> 01:31:51,497
Feeling like there is that one thing,
if you could just find it.

1524
01:31:51,628 --> 01:31:53,372
Then you'd finally be good enough.

1525
01:31:53,469 --> 01:31:54,512
Stand.

1526
01:31:56,832 --> 01:31:58,502
The champion's name.

1527
01:32:00,086 --> 01:32:01,221
Say it.

1528
01:32:28,548 --> 01:32:30,030
Look no offense mister,

1529
01:32:30,031 --> 01:32:32,670
but I don't think these things
have your best interest at heart.

1530
01:32:33,077 --> 01:32:35,896
Don't listen to this child.

1531
01:32:36,446 --> 01:32:38,317
Take the staff.

1532
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:43,804
Hold it and say the champion's name.

1533
01:32:44,096 --> 01:32:45,457
They're using you.

1534
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:48,723
You have to see that.
That they are using you.

1535
01:32:48,776 --> 01:32:50,110
Say your name.

1536
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:54,685
His name...

1537
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:57,324
is Captain Sparklefingers.

1538
01:32:57,683 --> 01:32:59,293
And we're gonna keep throwing things,

1539
01:32:59,327 --> 01:33:01,446
at your big fat ugly ass head,

1540
01:33:01,641 --> 01:33:03,469
until you let our brother go.

1541
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,492
Boy, am I glad I didn't sell that batarang.

1542
01:33:30,777 --> 01:33:32,031
Pedro, is that a lamp?

1543
01:33:32,312 --> 01:33:34,295
It's an ugly one.
Come on, come on, come on.

1544
01:33:34,819 --> 01:33:36,846
Guys, I appreciate the thought,
I really do.

1545
01:33:36,985 --> 01:33:38,204
But I don't think your
weapons are gonna help.

1546
01:33:38,229 --> 01:33:39,652
You can put them down now.

1547
01:33:41,138 --> 01:33:42,575
The door was right here.

1548
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:44,080
Billy, how do we get out of here?

1549
01:33:44,150 --> 01:33:45,645
What, you think I know?
I don't know.

1550
01:33:46,709 --> 01:33:47,740
This way!

1551
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:50,031
Go, go, go, go, go follow Darla.
Good job, Darla!

1552
01:33:50,297 --> 01:33:51,512
Go, go, go, go!

1553
01:33:51,675 --> 01:33:52,499
Kids?

1554
01:33:53,577 --> 01:33:54,799
Why is this open?

1555
01:33:55,478 --> 01:33:56,478
Freddy?

1556
01:33:56,914 --> 01:33:57,614
Mary?

1557
01:34:01,498 --> 01:34:02,498
Pedro, Pedro, come on.

1558
01:34:02,699 --> 01:34:04,194
Freddy, Freddy, keep up.

1559
01:34:04,868 --> 01:34:05,990
Darla, stay in front.

1560
01:34:07,396 --> 01:34:08,399
We gotta hurry.

1561
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:35,500
So many doors.

1562
01:34:36,556 --> 01:34:38,641
One of these has to be a way out, right?

1563
01:34:39,210 --> 01:34:40,438
Yeah, I would hope so.

1564
01:34:57,681 --> 01:34:58,771
Not this one.

1565
01:35:12,438 --> 01:35:13,565
Ok, no more doors.

1566
01:35:13,590 --> 01:35:14,885
Nobody open any more doors.

1567
01:35:15,010 --> 01:35:16,837
Come on, Billy,
what are we gonna do?

1568
01:35:16,903 --> 01:35:17,903
Darla, I don't know.

1569
01:35:17,905 --> 01:35:19,231
Billy, yes, you do, just. just think.

1570
01:35:19,232 --> 01:35:20,534
How'd you get out last time?

1571
01:35:20,859 --> 01:35:22,666
Last, last time I thought about the
subway and I was on the subway.

1572
01:35:22,736 --> 01:35:24,815
Then Billy, look,
think about the subway.

1573
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:26,898
Think about any place
except for here, ok?

1574
01:35:49,513 --> 01:35:50,607
Come on, come on, come on.

1575
01:35:50,632 --> 01:35:52,484
Why are you covering my eyes?

1576
01:35:52,675 --> 01:35:54,983
Really?
This is the first place you think of?

1577
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:56,319
You're welcome.

1578
01:35:56,544 --> 01:35:58,144
Why can't I see what's inside?

1579
01:35:58,316 --> 01:35:59,576
You are not old enough.

1580
01:35:59,773 --> 01:36:02,075
Old enough to know
that was great music.

1581
01:36:02,454 --> 01:36:03,240
Not my thing.

1582
01:36:03,364 --> 01:36:04,364
Where's Freddy?

1583
01:36:04,857 --> 01:36:05,983
Yeah, you too, Sriracha, hey,

1584
01:36:06,108 --> 01:36:07,319
have a holly, jolly Christmas.

1585
01:36:07,564 --> 01:36:08,882
Freddy, what are you doing?

1586
01:36:08,932 --> 01:36:10,527
It's nice people.

1587
01:36:10,783 --> 01:36:11,948
Nice pe... Come on.
Is that glitter?

1588
01:36:11,973 --> 01:36:13,528
They have glitter.
Can I get glitter?

1589
01:36:13,853 --> 01:36:15,378
No, not from them.
Please?

1590
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:16,939
No..

1591
01:36:18,982 --> 01:36:19,816
Darla.

1592
01:36:24,796 --> 01:36:26,280
Go, go, go, go!
Everybody go!

1593
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:27,976
Freddy, Freddy, Freddy.

1594
01:36:28,272 --> 01:36:29,939
One, two, three. Up we go.

1595
01:36:38,141 --> 01:36:39,853
Carnival. Go, go, go, go.
Mary, go.

1596
01:36:40,092 --> 01:36:41,092
Go. Come on, Pedro.

1597
01:36:41,152 --> 01:36:42,152
Come on.

1598
01:36:54,041 --> 01:36:55,368
Don't run, but don't walk.
Just be cool.
Walk, just be cool,

1599
01:36:55,369 --> 01:36:58,118
act naturally, like kids naturally
act in a carnival.

1600
01:36:58,241 --> 01:36:59,669
He's not gonna look for you...
Is that him?

1601
01:36:59,970 --> 01:37:01,491
Oh, my God, guys.
Dude, it's Zap-tain America!

1602
01:37:01,492 --> 01:37:03,569
Hey, Powerboy.
He's an impersonator, ok?

1603
01:37:03,694 --> 01:37:05,431
Yeah, I'm an impersonator.
I'm a fake version of myself.

1604
01:37:05,456 --> 01:37:06,662
Don't take pictures...

1605
01:37:08,237 --> 01:37:09,237
Shazam!

1606
01:37:16,702 --> 01:37:17,992
Hey, where'd he go?

1607
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:19,668
What, is he invisible now?

1608
01:37:26,578 --> 01:37:29,592
Oh, man, oh, man, I just spit on a baby!

1609
01:37:30,988 --> 01:37:32,656
Yo, what is that?

1610
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:37,686
Who is that guy?

1611
01:37:38,432 --> 01:37:39,908
Champion!

1612
01:37:42,650 --> 01:37:44,868
You don't deserve that name.

1613
01:37:46,528 --> 01:37:49,097
See that? Look at that up there!

1614
01:37:49,172 --> 01:37:52,496
Hiding behind innocent people
who will now die.

1615
01:37:54,180 --> 01:37:58,605
Because deep down, you're
still just a scared, little boy.

1616
01:38:00,257 --> 01:38:01,924
Oh, no.

1617
01:38:02,892 --> 01:38:04,308
Run!

1618
01:38:04,705 --> 01:38:05,903
Run!

1619
01:38:19,598 --> 01:38:21,463
What do we do? What do we do?
Just hold on!

1620
01:38:21,515 --> 01:38:23,237
To what?
The bar, you idiot!

1621
01:38:32,091 --> 01:38:33,861
Well, you wanted me to be a hero.

1622
01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:35,022
Are you kidding?

1623
01:38:35,572 --> 01:38:38,439
Ok, no. Old guy's up there
harboring multiple spiritual entities,

1624
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:40,543
plus, I mean, he has the same
powers as you, plus,

1625
01:38:40,844 --> 01:38:42,498
you know, he knows what he's doing,

1626
01:38:42,599 --> 01:38:44,545
plus, you're my best friend,
I don't want you to die.

1627
01:38:45,819 --> 01:38:47,858
If a superhero can't save his family,

1628
01:38:49,482 --> 01:38:50,863
he's not much of a hero.

1629
01:38:55,258 --> 01:38:56,797
That was a decent catchphrase.

1630
01:38:57,704 --> 01:38:58,839
Shazam!

1631
01:39:07,826 --> 01:39:09,912
Now let's try this again.

1632
01:39:23,862 --> 01:39:26,265
Or try that again.

1633
01:39:33,966 --> 01:39:35,039
Billy, look out!

1634
01:39:37,448 --> 01:39:38,560
Laser eyes?

1635
01:39:39,055 --> 01:39:40,188
Guys, he's got laser eyes!

1636
01:39:40,246 --> 01:39:42,281
Too bad your aim sucks balls!

1637
01:39:52,517 --> 01:39:53,676
That's his power matrix.

1638
01:39:53,727 --> 01:39:54,809
His what what?

1639
01:39:54,931 --> 01:39:57,475
When the demon guys leave his eye,
he loses his powers.

1640
01:39:58,139 --> 01:39:59,850
That's why the batarang hurt him.

1641
01:40:00,971 --> 01:40:03,147
Hey, over here!

1642
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:05,071
Wait. What are you doing?

1643
01:40:05,096 --> 01:40:06,142
Trust me. Divide and conquer.

1644
01:40:06,167 --> 01:40:08,915
We separate the sins from the eye,
and he's just an old man.

1645
01:40:09,316 --> 01:40:10,753
Gather the mutts.

1646
01:40:24,561 --> 01:40:25,562
Run!

1647
01:40:32,818 --> 01:40:34,204
Darla, no!

1648
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:50,352
Here, take it.

1649
01:40:50,653 --> 01:40:51,782
Take it, it's for you.

1650
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:53,219
Hold it tight.

1651
01:40:53,774 --> 01:40:55,028
Close your eyes.

1652
01:40:55,819 --> 01:40:57,993
Everything's gonna be ok.
Ok?

1653
01:40:59,172 --> 01:41:00,244
Ok.

1654
01:41:24,288 --> 01:41:25,288
Get up!

1655
01:41:40,707 --> 01:41:41,739
Shazam!

1656
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,621
Playtime's over, boy.

1657
01:42:14,046 --> 01:42:15,668
Your friends can't help you anymore.

1658
01:42:15,755 --> 01:42:16,923
Shazam!

1659
01:42:21,221 --> 01:42:22,221
Hey!

1660
01:42:48,661 --> 01:42:49,867
Shazam!

1661
01:43:15,141 --> 01:43:16,141
Nice trick.

1662
01:43:16,704 --> 01:43:17,747
Catchy.

1663
01:43:18,455 --> 01:43:19,866
One simple word.

1664
01:43:20,777 --> 01:43:22,066
I have a better trick.

1665
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:24,203
Four words.

1666
01:43:25,715 --> 01:43:27,035
Kill the little girl.

1667
01:43:28,274 --> 01:43:29,711
No, No! No!

1668
01:43:33,427 --> 01:43:34,592
Stop!

1669
01:43:50,593 --> 01:43:53,336
Billy, there is one more
demon guy in his eye!

1670
01:43:53,394 --> 01:43:54,860
You gotta just rip it out of his face...

1671
01:43:55,281 --> 01:43:56,773
It's where he gets his power.

1672
01:44:00,977 --> 01:44:02,175
Reach for it.

1673
01:44:03,961 --> 01:44:05,054
I dare you.

1674
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:15,437
Wise decision.

1675
01:44:17,657 --> 01:44:19,033
Hands on the staff.

1676
01:44:20,497 --> 01:44:21,789
Billy, don't do this. Billy!

1677
01:44:22,426 --> 01:44:24,239
Billy!
Don't do it, Billy! Don't!

1678
01:44:43,859 --> 01:44:45,129
<i>Say my name,</i>

1679
01:44:45,454 --> 01:44:47,493
<i>so my power may flow through you.</i>

1680
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:50,777
I open my heart to you, Billy Batson.

1681
01:44:50,929 --> 01:44:52,416
And in so doing,

1682
01:44:52,541 --> 01:44:55,183
choose you as champion.

1683
01:44:55,523 --> 01:44:59,253
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

1684
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:02,059
The thrones of our
brothers and sisters await!

1685
01:45:10,228 --> 01:45:11,696
All hands on deck.

1686
01:45:17,483 --> 01:45:18,483
Say my name.

1687
01:45:19,975 --> 01:45:20,975
Billy!

1688
01:45:21,199 --> 01:45:22,278
No, not my name. No.

1689
01:45:22,503 --> 01:45:24,140
Say the name that I say
to turn into this guy.

1690
01:45:25,603 --> 01:45:26,704
Shazam!

1691
01:46:05,297 --> 01:46:06,315
Guys.

1692
01:46:08,032 --> 01:46:09,413
What's happening?

1693
01:46:13,828 --> 01:46:15,004
I can fly!

1694
01:46:19,980 --> 01:46:20,980
Guys.

1695
01:46:21,393 --> 01:46:22,633
Check out these guns.

1696
01:46:24,318 --> 01:46:25,318
No.

1697
01:46:26,525 --> 01:46:27,705
It's not possible!

1698
01:46:29,841 --> 01:46:32,078
Gee whiz, mister.
Sorry I took your game.

1699
01:46:32,551 --> 01:46:33,629
Do you want it back?

1700
01:46:36,208 --> 01:46:37,803
Guys, I don't believe in violence,

1701
01:46:38,092 --> 01:46:40,138
but I think we should kick
this guy's butt, like,

1702
01:46:40,339 --> 01:46:41,333
really hard.

1703
01:46:53,206 --> 01:46:54,738
Guys, I think I can move really,

1704
01:46:55,873 --> 01:46:56,873
fast.

1705
01:46:57,377 --> 01:46:58,377
Hyperspeed!

1706
01:46:58,646 --> 01:46:59,546
Check!

1707
01:47:08,491 --> 01:47:09,191
Billy!

1708
01:47:09,772 --> 01:47:10,839
The eye.

1709
01:47:18,380 --> 01:47:19,415
Look out!

1710
01:47:24,341 --> 01:47:25,341
What?

1711
01:47:28,067 --> 01:47:29,022
What!
Dude!

1712
01:47:29,298 --> 01:47:30,703
You almost exploded me!

1713
01:48:17,059 --> 01:48:19,014
Dude, I've studied the fighting techniques

1714
01:48:19,139 --> 01:48:20,475
of every single superhero.

1715
01:48:21,866 --> 01:48:22,944
What do you got?

1716
01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:27,986
Well, that's terrifying.

1717
01:49:02,423 --> 01:49:04,129
Enough games, boy.

1718
01:49:05,459 --> 01:49:07,221
You think a pack of children can...

1719
01:49:10,288 --> 01:49:11,288
Wait, what?

1720
01:49:11,447 --> 01:49:13,847
You will beg for mercy,

1721
01:49:13,967 --> 01:49:15,704
as I feast on your heart.

1722
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:17,860
Slow...

1723
01:49:19,386 --> 01:49:21,481
Are you making some big, evil guy

1724
01:49:21,506 --> 01:49:23,068
speech right now or something?

1725
01:49:23,093 --> 01:49:25,390
You're like, a mile
away from me right now.

1726
01:49:25,415 --> 01:49:26,727
There's cars and trucks...

1727
01:49:26,752 --> 01:49:29,521
I will have the world eating
out of the palm of my hand...

1728
01:49:29,609 --> 01:49:32,212
All I see is mouth moving.
I don't hear any...

1729
01:49:32,245 --> 01:49:33,492
Only I...

1730
01:49:34,063 --> 01:49:36,015
have the power to unleash...

1731
01:49:37,469 --> 01:49:38,644
Oh, whatever, screw it.

1732
01:50:09,795 --> 01:50:11,195
Oh, my gosh, those people!

1733
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:20,160
Hi!

1734
01:50:20,986 --> 01:50:22,009
I caught you!

1735
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:34,336
I got it!

1736
01:50:35,011 --> 01:50:36,027
I got it!

1737
01:50:41,549 --> 01:50:43,073
Oh, my God, I do got it.

1738
01:51:00,379 --> 01:51:01,475
You're not gonna believe this,

1739
01:51:01,476 --> 01:51:03,293
but you're actually the first villain
I've ever fought.

1740
01:51:03,373 --> 01:51:05,245
It's, like, kind of a huge deal for me.

1741
01:51:20,484 --> 01:51:21,912
Somebody help!

1742
01:51:30,864 --> 01:51:31,864
Hadouken!

1743
01:51:36,543 --> 01:51:37,543
Hi!

1744
01:51:37,768 --> 01:51:38,796
It's really you.

1745
01:51:40,225 --> 01:51:42,600
My name is Darla
and I've been really good!

1746
01:51:43,202 --> 01:51:43,702
What?

1747
01:51:47,837 --> 01:51:49,090
Oh, crap.

1748
01:51:51,207 --> 01:51:52,850
No, no, no, no.
No, no!

1749
01:52:20,581 --> 01:52:21,621
Oh, my God!

1750
01:52:21,622 --> 01:52:23,016
Is he giving us suitcase wedgies?

1751
01:53:00,378 --> 01:53:02,316
So this is like the Seven
Deadly Sins, right?

1752
01:53:03,784 --> 01:53:05,370
I mean, I've never been
great at math, but...

1753
01:53:06,406 --> 01:53:08,193
The big angry one, that's Wrath yeah?

1754
01:53:08,978 --> 01:53:10,956
And then Gluttony, obvi...

1755
01:53:12,129 --> 01:53:13,129
Pride.

1756
01:53:13,763 --> 01:53:15,854
Greed and Sloth, Lust to...

1757
01:53:16,305 --> 01:53:17,650
I thought was gonna be way hotter,

1758
01:53:17,651 --> 01:53:18,980
I'm being honest.

1759
01:53:19,666 --> 01:53:22,379
But that's only six. Where's...
Where's lucky number seven?

1760
01:53:22,952 --> 01:53:24,472
Where's little man?
Where's Envy?

1761
01:53:25,275 --> 01:53:27,923
Is he just scared of me and my
family because we're so awesome?

1762
01:53:27,924 --> 01:53:29,080
Because I get that.

1763
01:53:29,567 --> 01:53:31,518
Like the other sins,
they get to come out and fight,

1764
01:53:31,724 --> 01:53:33,275
because they're big and strong and scary.

1765
01:53:33,574 --> 01:53:34,635
But Envy,

1766
01:53:35,899 --> 01:53:37,135
he's just a runt.

1767
01:53:49,925 --> 01:53:51,251
And that's why all the other sins

1768
01:53:51,276 --> 01:53:53,151
never invite him out to play, man.

1769
01:53:53,345 --> 01:53:54,901
Because they all know who'd win.

1770
01:53:55,906 --> 01:53:57,116
And it's not weak,

1771
01:53:57,160 --> 01:53:59,488
worthless, ugly.

1772
01:53:59,791 --> 01:54:00,905
Envy.

1773
01:54:27,197 --> 01:54:28,248
Gotcha.

1774
01:54:29,149 --> 01:54:30,247
Shazam!

1775
01:54:37,609 --> 01:54:38,609
Shazam!

1776
01:54:49,338 --> 01:54:51,184
Ready to go round up your buddies?

1777
01:55:20,316 --> 01:55:21,346
No.

1778
01:55:22,366 --> 01:55:23,413
No!

1779
01:55:53,356 --> 01:55:55,005
Here's the thing about power.

1780
01:55:56,005 --> 01:55:57,284
What good's power,

1781
01:55:57,655 --> 01:55:59,492
if you got nobody to share it with?

1782
01:56:01,284 --> 01:56:02,706
Nice.
Ta-da.

1783
01:56:03,231 --> 01:56:04,280
That's disgusting.

1784
01:56:04,405 --> 01:56:05,419
Fatality.

1785
01:56:06,882 --> 01:56:08,016
I got the voice.

1786
01:56:11,699 --> 01:56:12,777
What's that?

1787
01:56:18,601 --> 01:56:20,522
I can have anything I've ever wanted?

1788
01:56:24,329 --> 01:56:25,526
Billy, no.

1789
01:56:25,783 --> 01:56:27,203
No, no, no, no!

1790
01:56:32,492 --> 01:56:34,072
You should hear yourself.

1791
01:56:34,073 --> 01:56:34,628
That's not funny.

1792
01:56:34,629 --> 01:56:37,234
What, you think I'm gonna
put a demon ball in my head?

1793
01:56:37,235 --> 01:56:38,235
That's disgusting.

1794
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:39,404
It's not funny. Pretty funny.

1795
01:56:39,405 --> 01:56:40,426
You got me going.

1796
01:56:40,427 --> 01:56:41,811
Guys, guys. Guys.
You got me going.

1797
01:56:45,221 --> 01:56:45,840
What?

1798
01:56:47,890 --> 01:56:49,270
Oh, hey.

1799
01:56:59,745 --> 01:57:01,181
Alright, we did it!

1800
01:57:02,524 --> 01:57:03,905
Yeah! Yeah!

1801
01:57:04,506 --> 01:57:05,593
Thank you!

1802
01:57:06,467 --> 01:57:07,932
We did it!

1803
01:57:08,953 --> 01:57:12,275
Yeah, you guys are all safe.
There's no more danger anymore.

1804
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:14,695
We're fine. It's ok.
Alright, alright, alright.

1805
01:57:14,778 --> 01:57:15,821
We're good.

1806
01:57:26,308 --> 01:57:27,583
You sure this is gonna work?

1807
01:57:29,038 --> 01:57:30,284
Told ya.

1808
01:57:49,367 --> 01:57:51,328
You guys know what this place is, right?

1809
01:57:51,819 --> 01:57:54,424
A dark, haunted cave with demon statues.

1810
01:57:54,503 --> 01:57:57,084
Well, yes, but also...

1811
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:01,251
Lair!

1812
01:58:01,641 --> 01:58:02,701
We got a lair!

1813
01:58:02,973 --> 01:58:03,973
Lair.
Yeah.

1814
01:58:06,030 --> 01:58:07,056
We got a lair.

1815
01:58:08,763 --> 01:58:10,268
What's a lair?

1816
01:58:11,145 --> 01:58:13,220
And thanks to six superheroes,

1817
01:58:13,221 --> 01:58:14,754
citizens are back in their homes,

1818
01:58:14,836 --> 01:58:16,670
safe again with their families.

1819
01:58:17,172 --> 01:58:19,672
And here with an eyewitness
account of the events...

1820
01:58:19,914 --> 01:58:22,076

1821

01:58:31,501 --> 01:58:32,601
<i>♪ Every words... ♪</i>
Automatic top spot for best ever.

1826
01:58:35,192 --> 01:58:37,027
The man shattered
the glass noodle ceiling.

1827
01:58:37,111 --> 01:58:38,347
No. That's racist.

1828
01:58:38,348 --> 01:58:39,462
Not if I say it.

1829
01:58:39,513 --> 01:58:40,513
Guys.

1830
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:41,973
All hands on deck.

1831
01:58:44,712 --> 01:58:46,069
Wait! wait, wait, wait.

1832
01:58:46,932 --> 01:58:47,532
Wait.

1833
01:58:48,088 --> 01:58:49,311
Thank you for this food.

1834
01:58:49,765 --> 01:58:51,173
Thank you for this day.

1835
01:58:52,149 --> 01:58:53,178
Thank you for this family.

1836
01:58:53,964 --> 01:58:56,119
I thought maybe this time I'd stay.

1837
01:58:57,032 --> 01:58:59,444
I mean, after all.

1838
01:58:59,999 --> 01:59:01,094
I'm home.

1839
01:59:33,459 --> 01:59:35,210
He better not sit at our table.

1840
01:59:38,247 --> 01:59:39,248
Nope.

1841
01:59:41,649 --> 01:59:42,649
Ok.

1842
01:59:46,468 --> 01:59:47,717
What are you doing?

1843
01:59:48,166 --> 01:59:50,371
Waiting for your
imaginary BFF to show up?

1844
01:59:50,434 --> 01:59:51,434
Yeah.

1845
02:00:00,085 --> 02:00:01,276
What are you guys doing here?

1846
02:00:01,482 --> 02:00:02,990
Well, we're having lunch with you.

1847
02:00:03,073 --> 02:00:04,755
But you guys have
different lunch periods.

1848
02:00:04,845 --> 02:00:07,014
Well, we made a very
special arrangement.

1849
02:00:08,298 --> 02:00:09,853
Darla, what's going on?

1850
02:00:10,124 --> 02:00:11,185
Why are you asking me?

1851
02:00:11,945 --> 02:00:13,282
Freddy Freeman!

1852
02:00:15,266 --> 02:00:16,327
This guy...

1853
02:00:17,159 --> 02:00:20,812
taught me everything I know
about being a dope superhero.

1854
02:00:20,913 --> 02:00:22,617
True story, you should
get some pointers,

1855
02:00:22,842 --> 02:00:24,589
from him. What's going on,

1856
02:00:24,890 --> 02:00:27,545
my best bud, in the whole world.

1857
02:00:27,746 --> 02:00:30,692
And also new kids that
I'm meeting for the first time,

1858
02:00:30,893 --> 02:00:32,350
but seem very cool?

1859
02:00:33,634 --> 02:00:35,806
I invited another friend,
I hope that's ok.

Sun of Ra.

1862
02:03:38,495 --> 02:03:45,085
Ouroboros.

1863
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:50,465
Solomon's...

1864
02:03:50,549 --> 02:03:52,843
Knot.

1865
02:04:04,021 --> 02:04:07,524
No! No!

1866
02:04:13,905 --> 02:04:16,083
<i>Primitive symbols.</i>

1867
02:04:16,874 --> 02:04:19,074
<i>You walking talking monkeys</i>

1868
02:04:19,075 --> 02:04:21,375
<i>with your cave drawings.</i>

1869
02:04:21,976 --> 02:04:25,677
<i>You assume there is only one way
to gain magic.</i>

1870
02:04:26,278 --> 02:04:28,078
<i>No, no, no.</i>

1871
02:04:29,179 --> 02:04:32,879
<i>There are more ways
than a mind can imagine.</i>

1872
02:04:33,580 --> 02:04:35,180
What in God's name?

1873
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:39,973
<i>I name the gods, Doctor.
Not the other way around.</i>

1874
02:04:40,057 --> 02:04:43,268
<i>Oh, what fun
we're going to have together.</i>

1875
02:04:43,352 --> 02:04:47,314
<i>The Seven Realms are about to be ours.</i>

1876
02:11:13,742 --> 02:11:16,036
Don't beat yourself up, buddy.
You're gonna find someone.

1877
02:11:16,870 --> 02:11:18,621
Yeah, I'm sure.

1878
02:11:18,705 --> 02:11:20,999
Because there is plenty of fish
in the sea.

1879
02:11:22,709 --> 02:11:24,509
Of course it's not real.
I can't talk to fish.

1880
02:11:24,627 --> 02:11:27,328
Even if I could, I mean, honestly,
what could we do with that that's cool?

1881
02:11:27,638 --> 02:11:30,993
I don't know, maybe command
an army of billions in the ocean.

1882
02:11:31,676 --> 02:11:32,946
Oh, yeah.

1883
02:11:33,747 --> 02:11:35,146
Well, that's not that cool.
