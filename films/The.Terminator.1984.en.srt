1
00:04:05,138 --> 00:04:09,094
What the hell? Goddamn son of a bitch...

2
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:12,162
Goddamn son of a...

3
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:26,108
What the hell?

4
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:21,830
Hey, my turn!

5
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:25,801
Me.

6
00:05:28,405 --> 00:05:29,873
Come on.

7
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:33,011
Hey, what's wrong with this picture?

8
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:44,120
Nice night for a walk, eh?

9
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,893
Nice night for a walk.

10
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:55,448
Washday tomorrow. Nothing clean, right?

11
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:57,317
Nothing clean. Right.

12
00:05:57,385 --> 00:06:00,436
I think this guy's a couple cans short of a six-pack.

13
00:06:00,604 --> 00:06:01,914
Your clothes.

14
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,733
Give them to me. Now.

15
00:06:05,475 --> 00:06:07,194
Fuck you, asshole!

16
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:40,176
Hey, sugar, how about it?

17
00:06:40,744 --> 00:06:45,382
I don't have to put up with that bullshit, man.

18
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,851
She's always after me.

19
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:50,053
I don't... I don't...

20
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:54,718
Hey, buddy. Did you just see a real bright light?

21
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,437
See that guy?

22
00:07:58,505 --> 00:08:00,723
- Hold it right there! - He's rabbiting.

23
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,760
- Hey! I said hold it! - Go!

24
00:08:04,628 --> 00:08:07,797
That son of a bitch took my pants!

25
00:08:51,374 --> 00:08:55,611
- What day is it? The date! - 12th... May. Thursday.

26
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,014
- What year? - What?

27
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:12,862
He's got my gun! Let's go!

28
00:10:37,948 --> 00:10:41,400
3831, they lost the suspect.

29
00:12:07,403 --> 00:12:09,656
Guard it for me, big buns.

30
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:15,228
- Hi. - Hi. I'm late.

31
00:12:16,196 --> 00:12:17,514
So am I.

32
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,375
- I'm in it. - So am I.

33
00:13:09,014 --> 00:13:10,800
Honey, could I have that coffee now, please?

34
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:11,941
Yes, sir.

35
00:13:12,968 --> 00:13:15,670
- OK, who gets the burly beef? - Uh, I ordered barbecued beef.

36
00:13:15,673 --> 00:13:17,973
- I think that's mine, but I didn't order fries. He gets the barbecued beef.

37
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,759
- Mine's the chili beef deluxe. - OK, who gets the burly beef?

38
00:13:20,827 --> 00:13:23,412
Miss, we're ready to order now. - Yes, ma'am.

39
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,513
- Aah!

40
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:28,819
Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, lord.

41
00:13:30,887 --> 00:13:32,939
This isn't real leather, is it?

42
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:35,290
This special sucks.

43
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:38,829
Nice going, kid. Ought to give you the tip.

44
00:13:41,431 --> 00:13:44,768
Look at it this way... in a hundred years, who's going to care?

45
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:54,710
The twelve-gauge auto-loader.

46
00:13:57,113 --> 00:14:00,884
That's Italian. You can go pump or auto.

47
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:04,604
The.45 long slide, with laser sighting.

48
00:14:04,672 --> 00:14:08,157
These are brand-new. We just got them in. That's a good gun.

49
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:11,394
Just touch the trigger, the beam comes on, and you put the red dot

50
00:14:11,395 --> 00:14:14,213
where you want the bullet to go. You can't miss.

51
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:17,566
Anything else?

52
00:14:17,634 --> 00:14:20,069
A phased plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.

53
00:14:20,237 --> 00:14:22,171
Just what you see, pal.

54
00:14:23,323 --> 00:14:25,190
The Uzi 9mm.

55
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:30,829
You know your weapons, buddy. Any one of these is ideal for home defense.

56
00:14:31,597 --> 00:14:34,883
So, uh... which will it be?

57
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:36,101
All.

58
00:14:36,469 --> 00:14:38,670
I may close early today.

59
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,275
There's a 15-day wait on the handguns, but the rifles you can take right now.

60
00:14:43,843 --> 00:14:45,361
You can't do that.

61
00:14:45,828 --> 00:14:47,046
Wrong.

62
00:15:13,256 --> 00:15:16,224
Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.

63
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:19,963
Listen, I need you to come pick me up. My bike just broke down.

64
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,432
I don't care what you're doing. Come and get me. What the...

65
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,654
Hey, man, you got a serious attitude problem.

66
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:24,460
- Sarah Connor? - Yes?

67
00:16:36,806 --> 00:16:39,274
I'm on my break, Chuck. Carla's got my station.

68
00:16:39,275 --> 00:16:42,644
Sarah, come here! It's about you. I mean, sort of.

69
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:47,525
It's so incredible. You're not gonna believe this.

70
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:49,609
Sit down. You are going to love this.

71
00:16:49,652 --> 00:16:51,453
- Shh! - What?

72
00:16:51,454 --> 00:16:54,020
Has been compiled from several witnesses.

73
00:16:54,024 --> 00:16:57,226
Once again, Sarah Connor, thirty-five, mother of two,

74
00:16:57,293 --> 00:16:59,644
brutally shot to death in her home this afternoon.

75
00:16:59,712 --> 00:17:01,854
- You're dead, honey. - In other late-breaking news,

76
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,973
teamster representatives have issued a statement...

77
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,991
Yes, friends, if you're into stereo and you're into sound,

78
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:21,995
for the greatest sound around you, come to Bob's Stereo at 25000 Sepulveda Boulevard.

79
00:20:22,063 --> 00:20:26,034
Yes, we've got woofers, tweeters, the newest in digital audio and compact laser discs.

80
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:30,171
We've got graphic equalizers and sound balancers that adjust the sound to fit...

81
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:54,111
Sorry.

82
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:08,076
Hello.

83
00:21:08,144 --> 00:21:12,380
First, I'm gonna rip the buttons off your blouse, one by one,

84
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:16,918
and then run my tongue down your neck to your bare, gleaming breasts,

85
00:21:16,986 --> 00:21:22,424
and then slowly, slowly pull your jeans off... inch by inch.

86
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,909
Ginger, it's Matt!

87
00:21:25,978 --> 00:21:30,231
And lick your belly in circles further and further down,

88
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:33,468
and then pull your panties off with my teeth.

89
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:35,524
Who is this?

90
00:21:36,471 --> 00:21:38,873
I... I, uh... Sarah?

91
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:43,378
Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry. I thought you were...

92
00:21:43,445 --> 00:21:46,681
- Can I talk to Ginger, please? - Sure, Bunky.

93
00:21:49,584 --> 00:21:51,118
It's the creep.

94
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,054
Hello.

95
00:21:54,122 --> 00:21:57,392
First, I'm gonna rip the buttons off your blouse, one by one...

96
00:21:59,712 --> 00:22:03,297
You fuckin' pigs! Wait till I get my hands on you!

97
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,700
- Get off of me! Sit down, fella.

98
00:22:06,468 --> 00:22:07,701
Ed.

99
00:22:09,938 --> 00:22:12,040
- What do you got? - Dead girl.

100
00:22:12,107 --> 00:22:15,810
- I can see that. - Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35,

101
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:19,814
shot six times at less than ten feet. Large caliber weapon.

102
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:21,448
You know, these work.

103
00:22:23,018 --> 00:22:24,551
What's this?

104
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:28,155
Dead girl 2, sent over from Valley Division this afternoon.

105
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:34,746
- I'm sure there's a point to all of this. - Look at the name, Ed.

106
00:22:35,514 --> 00:22:39,667
Sarah Louise... Connor. Is this right?

107
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:42,403
You're kidding me.

108
00:22:42,471 --> 00:22:45,173
The press is going to be short-stroking it all over the place.

109
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:47,063
A one-day pattern killer.

110
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:49,452
I hate the weird ones.

111
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:55,616
So...

112
00:22:57,452 --> 00:22:59,420
Better than mortal man deserves.

113
00:23:06,995 --> 00:23:11,165
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley? - No, not lately. Did you check messages?

114
00:23:11,332 --> 00:23:13,000
Uh-uh. I thought you did.

115
00:23:17,406 --> 00:23:19,374
Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...

116
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:21,864
There you are, young man.

117
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:26,422
- You mind your mother. - So call me back, will you, dear? Uh, bye.

118
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,469
Hi, Sarah. Dan Moorski. Uh, something's come up,

119
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:33,971
and it looks like I won't be able to make it tonight.

120
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:37,508
Just can't get out of it. Look, I'm really sorry. I'll make it up to you.

121
00:23:37,576 --> 00:23:40,511
Call you in a day or so, OK? Sorry. Bye.

122
00:23:41,979 --> 00:23:45,382
That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?

123
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,854
He can't treat you like this. It's Friday night, for Christ's sake!

124
00:23:50,322 --> 00:23:51,989
I'll live.

125
00:23:52,357 --> 00:23:54,558
I'll break his kneecaps.

126
00:23:55,327 --> 00:23:59,296
Well... Pugsley still loves me, don't you, baby?

127
00:24:00,432 --> 00:24:03,100
God. It's disgusting.

128
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:06,720
- I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo. - OK.

129
00:24:06,788 --> 00:24:09,923
- You and Matt have a good time. - We will. You, too.

130
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:11,009
OK.

131
00:24:15,097 --> 00:24:16,897
Damn it, Matt!

132
00:25:13,537 --> 00:25:15,071
Oh, shit.

133
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,939
Lieutenant, are you aware that these two killings

134
00:25:17,941 --> 00:25:20,243
occurred in the same order as their listings in the phone book?

135
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:22,545
Now, what can I tell you guys? No comment.

136
00:25:22,613 --> 00:25:24,414
But, lieutenant, we've got two murders...

137
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:38,928
- That coffee's two hours cold. - Mm-hmm.

138
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,864
I put a cigarette out in it.

139
00:25:42,132 --> 00:25:45,468
- Did you reach the next girl yet? - No. I keep getting an answering machine.

140
00:25:45,536 --> 00:25:46,910
- Send a unit. - I sent a unit.

141
00:25:46,936 --> 00:25:49,439
There's no answer at the door, and the apartment manager's not home.

142
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:50,315
Call her.

143
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,524
- I just called her. - Call her again.

144
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,636
Give me a cigarette.

145
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:06,906
Hi there.

146
00:26:07,574 --> 00:26:12,378
Ha ha ha. Fooled you. You're talking to a machine, but don't be shy, it's OK.

147
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,704
Same shit.

148
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:27,376
I can hear it now. He's gonna be called the goddamn "Phone Book killer."

149
00:26:27,444 --> 00:26:32,614
I hate these press cases, especially the weird press cases.

150
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,736
- Where you going? - To make a statement.

151
00:26:36,903 --> 00:26:39,271
Maybe make these jackals work for us for a change.

152
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:43,526
If I can get on the tube by eleven o'clock, maybe she'll call us.

153
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,128
Well...

154
00:26:45,596 --> 00:26:48,314
- How do I look? - Like shit, boss.

155
00:26:48,582 --> 00:26:49,782
Your mama.

156
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:51,152
Lieutenant!

157
00:26:51,185 --> 00:26:54,337
This just in. Police have announced the name of the victim

158
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:58,324
in the second of two execution-style murders which took place today.

159
00:26:58,391 --> 00:27:02,795
Incredibly, the names of the two victims are virtually identical.

160
00:27:02,796 --> 00:27:06,942
Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann Connor was pronounced dead at the scene

161
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:09,035
- in her Santa Monica apartment... - Can we change this?

162
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,595
- Sure. - Sarah Louise Connor was slain by an...

163
00:27:10,621 --> 00:27:14,073
Don't touch it! - unknown gunman earlier today in her home.

164
00:27:14,141 --> 00:27:16,892
Now, police are refusing to speculate on the apparent similarity

165
00:27:16,893 --> 00:27:20,629
between these shooting deaths, and no other connection between the two victims

166
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,831
has been established as of yet.

167
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:26,536
Of course, we'll have more on this late-breaking story as it comes in.

168
00:27:26,904 --> 00:27:31,541
A spectacular fire fueled by solvents, oils, and other flammable liquids

169
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,276
swept through an oil company on North Spring Street

170
00:27:34,345 --> 00:27:37,180
just northeast of Chinatown Wednesday night...

171
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:02,164
- Hey, you got a phone? - It's in the back! Hey! 4.50.

172
00:29:41,538 --> 00:29:44,757
You have reached the Los Angeles Police Department emergency number.

173
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:48,263
All our lines are busy. If you need a police car sent out to you,

174
00:29:48,365 --> 00:29:49,780
please stay on the line.

175
00:29:49,846 --> 00:29:54,135
POLICE RADIO: 2-11 in progress at Bob's Liquor, corner of third and Cameron.

176
00:30:53,877 --> 00:30:58,230
Pugsley, shoo! Go on. I'm going to make a belt out of you.

177
00:31:09,209 --> 00:31:10,643
Whoa!

178
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,880
Don't make me bust you up, man!

179
00:32:15,425 --> 00:32:17,593
Hi there. Ha ha ha. Fooled you.

180
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,862
You're talking to a machine, but don't be shy, it's OK.

181
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:23,465
Machines need love too, so talk to it,

182
00:32:23,533 --> 00:32:26,485
and Ginger, that's me, or Sarah will get back to you.

183
00:32:26,553 --> 00:32:28,136
Wait for the beep.

184
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,756
Ginger, this is Sarah! Pick up if you're there!

185
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:36,992
I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard called Technoir. I'm really scared.

186
00:32:37,018 --> 00:32:39,643
I think that there's somebody's after me.

187
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:42,625
Uh, I hope that you play this back soon.

188
00:32:42,668 --> 00:32:45,988
I need you and Matt to come and pick me up as soon as possible.

189
00:32:46,055 --> 00:32:49,874
The police keep transferring me around. I'm gonna give them another try.

190
00:32:49,942 --> 00:32:54,082
The number here is 555-9175.

191
00:32:54,108 --> 00:32:56,006
Call me, kiddo. I need your help.

192
00:33:13,649 --> 00:33:15,016
It's her.

193
00:33:16,018 --> 00:33:20,137
- Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler. - Look, Lieutenant, don't put me on hold

194
00:33:20,138 --> 00:33:23,241
- and don't transfer me to another department! - Don't worry. I won't. Now, just relax.

195
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:26,314
- Can you tell me where you are? - I'm in this bar called Technoir.

196
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,068
Yeah, I know. It's on Pico. Are you all right?

197
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:32,472
Yeah, but I don't want to leave. I think there's a guy following me.

198
00:33:32,498 --> 00:33:34,982
All right, now, listen, Miss Connor, now, listen carefully,

199
00:33:35,008 --> 00:33:37,564
you're in a public place, so you'll be safe till we get there,

200
00:33:37,565 --> 00:33:40,405
but stay visible. Don't go outside or even to the rest room.

201
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,811
- I'll have a car there in a hot minute. - OK.

202
00:36:48,964 --> 00:36:50,849
Come with me if you want to live.

203
00:37:00,258 --> 00:37:02,009
Come on!

204
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:16,884
This is 1-L19. I got a hit-and-run felony.

205
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:21,372
Suspect vehicle... late model gray Ford, headed westbound on 7th.

206
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,808
He's really moving, punching lights all the way.

207
00:38:23,876 --> 00:38:28,196
I'm going to need an ambulance at 7th and Broadway right now.

208
00:38:29,165 --> 00:38:30,365
Hold it!

209
00:38:34,237 --> 00:38:36,971
All units watch for a late-model gray Ford,

210
00:38:36,972 --> 00:38:39,524
last seen westbound on 7th and Broadway.

211
00:38:47,216 --> 00:38:48,448
Hold on.

212
00:39:00,209 --> 00:39:03,496
Are you injured? Are you shot?

213
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,299
No!

214
00:39:09,336 --> 00:39:12,304
Do exactly what I say. Exactly.

215
00:39:12,772 --> 00:39:16,643
Don't move unless I say. Don't make a sound unless I say.

216
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,345
Do you understand?

217
00:39:18,912 --> 00:39:22,565
- Do you understand? - Yes! Yes! Please, don't hurt me.

218
00:39:40,766 --> 00:39:44,537
I'm here to help you. I'm Reese, Sergeant Techcom,

219
00:39:44,539 --> 00:39:49,425
DN38416, assigned to protect you. You've been targeted for termination.

220
00:39:54,749 --> 00:39:58,151
Attempt to intercept, 1-L19.

221
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:03,889
This is 1-L19. Westbound on Olympic approaching Overland.

222
00:40:08,395 --> 00:40:11,675
This is a mistake. I didn't do anything.

223
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:15,354
No, but you will. It's very important that you live.

224
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,424
This isn't true. How could that man just get up after you...

225
00:40:19,425 --> 00:40:21,895
He's not a man. A machine.

226
00:40:22,146 --> 00:40:26,346
A Terminator. A Cyberdine systems model 101.

227
00:40:34,271 --> 00:40:35,642
A machine?

228
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:41,193
- Like a robot? - Not a robot. A cyborg.

229
00:40:41,461 --> 00:40:43,040
A cybernetic organism.

230
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,999
- No. He was bleeding. - Just a second.

231
00:40:49,169 --> 00:40:50,519
Get your head down!

232
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:38,700
All right, listen. The Terminator's an infiltration unit...

233
00:41:38,768 --> 00:41:43,371
part man, part machine. Underneath, it's a hyperalloy combat chassis...

234
00:41:43,439 --> 00:41:47,192
microprocessor controlled, fully armored, very tough.

235
00:41:47,193 --> 00:41:49,627
But outside, it's living human tissue.

236
00:41:49,963 --> 00:41:54,116
Flesh, skin, hair, blood... grown for the cyborgs.

237
00:41:54,184 --> 00:41:55,684
Look, Reese, I don't know what you want from...

238
00:41:55,752 --> 00:41:58,921
Pay attention! I got to ditch this car.

239
00:42:04,195 --> 00:42:08,147
The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.

240
00:42:08,215 --> 00:42:10,783
But these are new. They look human...

241
00:42:10,851 --> 00:42:14,870
Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot.

242
00:42:15,038 --> 00:42:17,840
I had to wait till he moved on you before I could zero him.

243
00:42:18,408 --> 00:42:24,505
Look... I am not stupid, you know. They cannot make things like that yet.

244
00:42:24,531 --> 00:42:28,592
Not yet. Not for about forty years.

245
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:35,440
- Are you saying it's from the future? - One possible future.

246
00:42:35,908 --> 00:42:39,028
From your point of view... I don't know tech stuff.

247
00:42:40,363 --> 00:42:43,165
Then you're from the future, too, is that right?

248
00:42:43,233 --> 00:42:45,418
- Right. - Right.

249
00:42:53,293 --> 00:42:56,845
Cyborgs don't feel pain. I do.

250
00:42:57,113 --> 00:42:58,597
Don't do that again.

251
00:42:58,664 --> 00:43:01,100
- Just let me go. - Listen!

252
00:43:01,268 --> 00:43:05,755
And understand. That Terminator is out there.

253
00:43:06,657 --> 00:43:11,027
It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with.

254
00:43:11,094 --> 00:43:15,331
It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear.

255
00:43:15,399 --> 00:43:19,068
And it absolutely will not stop. Ever!

256
00:43:19,435 --> 00:43:21,920
Until you are dead.

257
00:43:31,348 --> 00:43:33,249
Can you stop it?

258
00:43:37,337 --> 00:43:38,937
I don't know.

259
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,525
With these weapons, I don't know.

260
00:43:59,659 --> 00:44:02,579
All units. All units. Gray Ford suspect vehicle's been found

261
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:05,247
in a parking structure at 4th and Beaudry.

262
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:48,573
Reese.

263
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:51,627
Why me?

264
00:44:53,663 --> 00:44:55,681
Why does it want me?

265
00:45:02,155 --> 00:45:04,256
There was a nuclear war...

266
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:08,260
A few years from now.

267
00:45:10,797 --> 00:45:12,331
All this...

268
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:15,902
This whole place. Everything.

269
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:18,136
It's gone.

270
00:45:19,806 --> 00:45:21,474
Just gone.

271
00:45:21,841 --> 00:45:23,743
There were survivors.

272
00:45:23,911 --> 00:45:26,362
Here. There.

273
00:45:28,765 --> 00:45:30,967
Nobody even knew who started it.

274
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:36,037
It was the machines, Sarah.

275
00:45:37,306 --> 00:45:41,443
- I don't understand. - Defense network computers.

276
00:45:42,278 --> 00:45:45,848
New... powerful...

277
00:45:46,415 --> 00:45:50,853
Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all.

278
00:45:51,221 --> 00:45:56,474
They say it got smart... a new order of intelligence.

279
00:45:57,242 --> 00:46:01,698
Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side.

280
00:46:02,765 --> 00:46:05,668
Decided our fate in a microsecond...

281
00:46:07,236 --> 00:46:09,004
extermination.

282
00:46:23,284 --> 00:46:25,519
Did you see this war?

283
00:46:37,265 --> 00:46:40,684
No. I grew up after it...

284
00:46:40,752 --> 00:46:43,988
In the ruins. Starving...

285
00:46:44,055 --> 00:46:46,407
- Hiding from HKs. - HKs?

286
00:46:46,475 --> 00:46:51,528
Hunter-killers. Patrol machines built in automated factories.

287
00:46:52,196 --> 00:46:57,019
Most of us were rounded up, put in camps for orderly disposal.

288
00:46:58,687 --> 00:47:01,538
This was burned in by laser scanner.

289
00:47:05,327 --> 00:47:09,748
Some of us were kept alive... to work...

290
00:47:10,615 --> 00:47:16,069
Loading bodies. The disposal units ran night and day.

291
00:47:16,137 --> 00:47:19,507
We were that close to going out forever.

292
00:47:21,975 --> 00:47:25,846
But there was one man who taught us to fight,

293
00:47:25,914 --> 00:47:31,719
to storm the wire of the camps, to smash those metal motherfuckers into junk.

294
00:47:32,687 --> 00:47:35,890
He turned it around. He brought us back from the brink.

295
00:47:35,898 --> 00:47:40,101
His name was Connor. John Connor.

296
00:47:40,628 --> 00:47:42,229
Your son, Sarah.

297
00:47:43,265 --> 00:47:45,299
Your unborn son.

298
00:49:34,943 --> 00:49:36,360
Drive!

299
00:49:43,185 --> 00:49:46,252
Reese!

300
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:07,540
No, Reese! No! No! No! They'll kill you.

301
00:50:07,608 --> 00:50:10,961
You in the Cadillac! Let me see your hands now!

302
00:50:13,498 --> 00:50:15,065
Get out of the car!

303
00:50:18,736 --> 00:50:20,605
Drop to your knees!

304
00:50:20,972 --> 00:50:23,740
Out of the car. Drop to the ground.

305
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:54,070
Sarah...

306
00:50:54,338 --> 00:50:56,741
Sarah, try to drink some of this.

307
00:50:59,409 --> 00:51:04,431
Listen, are you sure it's them? Maybe... maybe I should look at the bodies.

308
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:07,334
No. They've been identified, and there's no doubt.

309
00:51:07,402 --> 00:51:09,569
Oh, God.

310
00:51:09,571 --> 00:51:11,238
God!

311
00:51:11,305 --> 00:51:13,407
Ginger!

312
00:51:16,644 --> 00:51:18,078
Sarah.

313
00:51:18,913 --> 00:51:21,749
- Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman. - Hi, Sarah.

314
00:51:21,817 --> 00:51:24,802
I want you to tell him everything that Reese told you.

315
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:28,439
- Do you feel up to that? - Yeah. I guess so.

316
00:51:30,074 --> 00:51:31,742
You're a doctor?

317
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:35,863
- Criminal psychologist. - Is Reese crazy?

318
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:38,360
Well, that's what we're gonna find out.

319
00:53:03,551 --> 00:53:07,253
DR.So, you're a soldier, fighting for whom?

320
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:14,127
With the 132nd, under Perry. From '21 to '27.

321
00:53:14,294 --> 00:53:19,048
- That's the year 2027? - That's right. And I was assigned...

322
00:53:19,116 --> 00:53:20,717
This is fucking great.

323
00:53:20,784 --> 00:53:23,105
The last two years under John Connor.

324
00:53:23,131 --> 00:53:26,439
- Who was the enemy again? - A computer defense system built for...

325
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,958
- Oh, damn. Sorry.

326
00:53:28,993 --> 00:53:32,328
Built for SAC-NORAD by Cyberdine systems.

327
00:53:32,396 --> 00:53:33,830
I see.

328
00:53:34,398 --> 00:53:40,370
And this, uh, computer thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy,

329
00:53:40,538 --> 00:53:44,090
killing him, in effect, before he's even conceived,

330
00:53:44,157 --> 00:53:46,459
a sort of retroactive abortion?

331
00:53:47,826 --> 00:53:49,261
That guy Silberman cracks me up.

332
00:53:49,329 --> 00:53:52,088
Last week, he had this guy in here that burned his Afghan. He screwed it first,

333
00:53:52,114 --> 00:53:54,067
- then he set it on fire. - Hey, shut up.

334
00:53:54,135 --> 00:53:56,252
Why didn't the computer just kill Connor then?

335
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,222
Why this elaborate scheme with the Terminator?

336
00:53:59,289 --> 00:54:03,543
It had no choice. Their defense grid was smashed.

337
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:07,764
We'd won. Taking out Connor then would make no difference.

338
00:54:08,032 --> 00:54:11,117
Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence.

339
00:54:11,185 --> 00:54:15,071
Is that when you captured the lab complex and found that... uh, what is it called?

340
00:54:15,139 --> 00:54:18,241
Uh... the time displacement equipment?

341
00:54:18,509 --> 00:54:22,612
That's right. The Terminator had already gone through.

342
00:54:22,779 --> 00:54:26,082
Connor sent me to intercept, and they blew the whole place.

343
00:54:26,249 --> 00:54:28,267
How are you supposed get back?

344
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:29,961
I can't.

345
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:33,640
Nobody goes home.

346
00:54:35,142 --> 00:54:41,181
Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.

347
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:28,787
It's just him and me.

348
00:56:31,374 --> 00:56:36,311
Why didn't you bring any weapons, something more advanced?

349
00:56:36,379 --> 00:56:39,315
Don't you have ray guns?

350
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:41,149
Ray guns.

351
00:56:41,217 --> 00:56:43,752
DR. Show me a piece of future technology.

352
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:48,062
You go naked. Something about the field generated by a living organism.

353
00:56:48,124 --> 00:56:50,292
- Nothing dead will go. - Why?

354
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:54,630
- I didn't build the fucking thing! - OK, OK. But this...

355
00:56:54,698 --> 00:56:58,234
- Cyborg, if it's metal... - Surrounded by living tissue!

356
00:56:58,302 --> 00:56:59,485
Oh. Right, right...

357
00:57:00,353 --> 00:57:03,288
This is great stuff. I could make a career out of this guy.

358
00:57:03,355 --> 00:57:06,223
You see how clever this part is? How it doesn't require a shred of proof?

359
00:57:06,224 --> 00:57:10,295
And most paranoid delusions are intricate, but this is brilliant.

360
00:57:11,597 --> 00:57:13,981
DR. Why were the other two women killed?

361
00:57:14,007 --> 00:57:16,176
Most of the records were lost in the war.

362
00:57:16,219 --> 00:57:21,084
Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor's mother. Her full name, where she lived.

363
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:24,751
They just knew the city. The Terminator was just being systematic.

364
00:57:24,795 --> 00:57:28,590
- Uh-huh. Well, let's go back to... - Look, you have heard enough!

365
00:57:28,716 --> 00:57:32,150
I have answered your questions! Now I have to see Sarah Connor!

366
00:57:32,152 --> 00:57:35,604
- I'm afraid that's not up to me. - Then why am I talking to you?

367
00:57:35,672 --> 00:57:37,673
- Because I can help you. - Who is in authority here?

368
00:57:37,699 --> 00:57:39,508
- Reese... - Shut up!

369
00:57:40,076 --> 00:57:42,644
You still don't get it, do you?

370
00:57:42,812 --> 00:57:46,247
He'll find her. That's what he does!

371
00:57:46,315 --> 00:57:50,052
That's all he does! You can't stop him!

372
00:57:50,055 --> 00:57:54,291
He'll wade through you, reach down her throat, and pull her fucking heart out!

373
00:57:54,323 --> 00:57:57,075
- Doc. Let... let go of me!

374
00:58:00,729 --> 00:58:02,097
Sorry.

375
00:58:07,002 --> 00:58:10,655
- So, Reese is crazy? - In technical terminology...

376
00:58:10,823 --> 00:58:12,390
He's a loon.

377
00:58:12,758 --> 00:58:16,162
Sarah, this is what they call body armor.

378
00:58:16,529 --> 00:58:20,632
Our TAC guys wear these. It'll stop a twelve-gauge round.

379
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:25,378
This other individual must have been wearing one under his coat. Feel that. Go ahead.

380
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:29,073
What about when he punched through the windshield?

381
00:58:29,141 --> 00:58:31,760
He was probably on PCP. Broke every bone in his hand

382
00:58:31,828 --> 00:58:34,658
and wouldn't feel it for hours. There was this guy once...

383
00:58:34,684 --> 00:58:36,198
- You see this scar? - Here.

384
00:58:36,266 --> 00:58:37,733
Thank you.

385
00:58:38,101 --> 00:58:42,221
There's a couch in this other room. Why don't you stretch out and try to get some sleep?

386
00:58:42,288 --> 00:58:44,769
It'll be at least an hour before your mother gets here from Big Bear.

387
00:58:44,825 --> 00:58:47,760
- I can't sleep. - Try.

388
00:58:47,928 --> 00:58:52,080
Well, it may not look it, but that couch is very comfortable.

389
00:58:53,449 --> 00:58:58,254
You'll be perfectly safe. We got thirty cops in this building.

390
00:58:59,122 --> 00:59:00,488
Thank you.

391
00:59:06,095 --> 00:59:08,496
- Good night. - Good night.

392
00:59:22,811 --> 00:59:24,820
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.

393
00:59:24,846 --> 00:59:27,005
I was told that she's here. Could I see her, please?

394
00:59:27,031 --> 00:59:29,685
No. You can't see her. She's making a statement.

395
00:59:29,711 --> 00:59:32,469
- Where is she? - Look, it may take a while...

396
00:59:32,495 --> 00:59:34,799
if you want to wait, there's a bench over there.

397
00:59:45,701 --> 00:59:47,653
I'll be back.

398
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,482
What the hell was that?

399
01:00:25,808 --> 01:00:27,092
Gunshot!

400
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:38,772
What is it, terrorists? Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

401
01:00:43,025 --> 01:00:44,927
Stay here.

402
01:00:58,591 --> 01:00:59,647
Let's get out of here!

403
01:00:59,673 --> 01:01:02,654
- Come on! Come on! - He's got an automatic weapon!

404
01:01:05,197 --> 01:01:07,282
Move it, move it, move it, move it!

405
01:01:17,911 --> 01:01:19,961
What the hell happened to the lights?

406
01:01:24,567 --> 01:01:26,034
Watch him.

407
01:01:46,506 --> 01:01:49,391
Automatic weapons! Lock and load! Let's go!

408
01:02:17,452 --> 01:02:18,952
Fire! Fire!

409
01:02:33,301 --> 01:02:34,969
Ed.

410
01:02:35,771 --> 01:02:37,205
Hey!

411
01:03:03,782 --> 01:03:05,116
Sarah!

412
01:03:06,702 --> 01:03:08,069
Reese!

413
01:03:12,041 --> 01:03:13,425
This way.

414
01:03:53,998 --> 01:03:56,408
KFLB news time 4:36.

415
01:03:56,434 --> 01:03:59,692
In the top story of the hour, the largest single law enforcement

416
01:03:59,718 --> 01:04:03,207
mobilization in California history is currently underway.

417
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:04,853
- Police in five Southern counties...

418
01:04:04,854 --> 01:04:07,544
are engaged in a massive manhunt for an unident...

419
01:04:10,582 --> 01:04:12,149
Take this.

420
01:04:14,986 --> 01:04:17,288
All right, let's get this off the road.

421
01:04:48,737 --> 01:04:51,889
- You cold? - Freezing.

422
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:07,188
Reese...

423
01:05:08,323 --> 01:05:10,391
You got a first name?

424
01:05:10,759 --> 01:05:11,875
Kyle.

425
01:05:12,143 --> 01:05:16,614
Kyle... what's it like when you go through time?

426
01:05:19,617 --> 01:05:21,285
White light.

427
01:05:23,922 --> 01:05:25,490
Pain.

428
01:05:28,526 --> 01:05:32,446
- It's like being born maybe. - Oh, my God.

429
01:05:33,514 --> 01:05:35,550
I caught one back there.

430
01:05:37,118 --> 01:05:40,254
- You mean you got shot? - It's not bad.

431
01:05:40,822 --> 01:05:44,225
- We got to get you to a doctor. - It's OK. Forget it.

432
01:05:44,393 --> 01:05:47,228
What do you mean, forget it? Are you crazy?

433
01:05:47,996 --> 01:05:49,714
Take this off.

434
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:02,942
Jesus.

435
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:05,545
See, it passed right through the meat.

436
01:06:06,013 --> 01:06:10,801
Oh, this is going to make me puke. Would you just talk about something?

437
01:06:10,869 --> 01:06:11,956
What?

438
01:06:11,982 --> 01:06:16,006
I don't know. Anything. Just talk. Tell me about my son.

439
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:18,859
He's about my height.

440
01:06:22,513 --> 01:06:24,615
He has your eyes.

441
01:06:27,853 --> 01:06:29,854
What's he like?

442
01:06:30,121 --> 01:06:34,259
You trust him. He's got a strength.

443
01:06:35,427 --> 01:06:37,945
I'd die for John Connor.

444
01:06:40,348 --> 01:06:44,351
Well... at least now I know what to name him.

445
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:47,110
I don't suppose you know who the father is,

446
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:50,032
so I won't tell him to get lost when I meet him.

447
01:06:50,075 --> 01:06:52,509
John never said much about him.

448
01:06:52,977 --> 01:06:55,646
- I know he dies before the war... - Wait!

449
01:06:57,482 --> 01:06:59,350
I don't want to know.

450
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:03,520
So, was it John that sent you here?

451
01:07:03,888 --> 01:07:05,556
I volunteered.

452
01:07:06,791 --> 01:07:07,924
Why?

453
01:07:08,192 --> 01:07:13,464
It was a chance to meet the legend... Sarah Connor.

454
01:07:14,132 --> 01:07:18,519
Taught her son to fight, organize,

455
01:07:18,587 --> 01:07:20,905
prepare from when he was a kid.

456
01:07:20,973 --> 01:07:23,424
When you were in hiding before the war...

457
01:07:27,028 --> 01:07:30,497
You're talking about things I haven't done yet in the past tense.

458
01:07:30,565 --> 01:07:33,200
- It's driving me crazy. - Aah!

459
01:07:36,438 --> 01:07:38,773
Are you sure you have the right person?

460
01:07:39,141 --> 01:07:40,808
I'm sure.

461
01:07:41,476 --> 01:07:44,914
Come on. Do I look like the mother of the future?

462
01:07:46,982 --> 01:07:51,886
I mean, am I tough? Organized? I can't even balance my checkbook.

463
01:07:54,923 --> 01:08:00,278
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor, and I don't want it! Any of it!

464
01:08:03,883 --> 01:08:08,235
Your son gave me a message to give to you. Made me memorize it.

465
01:08:09,203 --> 01:08:12,290
"Thank you, Sarah, for your courage through the dark years.

466
01:08:12,358 --> 01:08:17,028
I can't help you with what you must soon face except to say that the future is not set.

467
01:08:17,029 --> 01:08:19,681
You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.

468
01:08:19,715 --> 01:08:24,620
You must survive, or I will never exist". That's all.

469
01:08:27,822 --> 01:08:30,007
It's a good field dressing.

470
01:08:30,926 --> 01:08:34,963
You like it? It's my first.

471
01:08:38,733 --> 01:08:41,768
Get some sleep. It will be light soon.

472
01:08:45,473 --> 01:08:46,940
OK.

473
01:08:57,468 --> 01:08:59,569
Talk to me some more.

474
01:09:02,573 --> 01:09:04,209
About what?

475
01:09:05,376 --> 01:09:07,977
Tell me about where you're from.

476
01:09:10,181 --> 01:09:11,748
All right.

477
01:09:13,284 --> 01:09:17,954
You stay down by day, but at night you can move around.

478
01:09:18,022 --> 01:09:22,194
You still have to be careful because the HKs use infrared.

479
01:09:23,862 --> 01:09:29,749
But they're not too bright. John taught us ways to dust them.

480
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:33,152
That's when the infiltrators started to appear.

481
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:36,756
The Terminators were the newest... The worst.

482
01:09:46,417 --> 01:09:48,451
Traversing your sector in search mode.

483
01:09:48,452 --> 01:09:51,687
750 meters north of your position.

484
01:09:51,822 --> 01:09:54,891
Understood. 750 meters north.

485
01:09:56,459 --> 01:09:58,027
Let's go.

486
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,011
Intercept. Over.

487
01:10:02,081 --> 01:10:04,616
There are scavenger teams in that quadrant.

488
01:10:04,684 --> 01:10:09,022
Avoid contact. Repeat, avoid contact. We'll get them later.

489
01:10:09,689 --> 01:10:11,374
Roger, echo leader.

490
01:10:16,529 --> 01:10:21,100
- Sector niner, what's your status? - Situation normal.

491
01:10:36,615 --> 01:10:40,419
Firebase, what's your status? Over.

492
01:10:43,056 --> 01:10:46,842
- Reese. DN384... - Right. Let him in.

493
01:10:50,447 --> 01:10:53,399
Any infiltrators at the shopping mall?

494
01:10:53,467 --> 01:10:59,305
No problem. They were clean. We're cutting short the patrol. Over.

495
01:10:59,673 --> 01:11:03,659
Roger, Yankee-1-7. You are clear to return.

496
01:12:18,268 --> 01:12:20,219
Terminator! Terminator!

497
01:13:37,363 --> 01:13:39,798
I was dreaming about dogs.

498
01:13:40,934 --> 01:13:43,336
We use them to spot Terminators.

499
01:13:44,603 --> 01:13:47,272
Your world is pretty terrifying.

500
01:14:25,728 --> 01:14:29,715
Hey, buddy, you got a dead cat in there, or what?

501
01:14:37,324 --> 01:14:39,642
Fuck you, asshole.

502
01:14:58,261 --> 01:15:00,162
Goddamn!

503
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:02,698
Thank you.

504
01:15:06,736 --> 01:15:09,271
Uh, is this enough?

505
01:15:09,939 --> 01:15:13,243
Yeah, it's enough. I don't want to ask where you got it.

506
01:15:19,315 --> 01:15:21,150
I'm coming. - We need a room.

507
01:15:21,151 --> 01:15:23,086
- All right. - With a kitchen.

508
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:25,420
Do you have one with a kitchen?

509
01:15:37,483 --> 01:15:39,219
Mmm.

510
01:15:40,886 --> 01:15:43,422
I am dying for a shower.

511
01:15:45,225 --> 01:15:47,443
We should check your bandage, too.

512
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:50,846
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

513
01:15:55,434 --> 01:15:57,119
Keep this.

514
01:16:22,696 --> 01:16:26,232
No, I can't tell you where I am, mom. I was told not to say.

515
01:16:26,233 --> 01:16:28,432
Oh, but, honey, I need to know where I can reach you.

516
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:31,879
You tell me to hide out up here at the cabin like some fugitive and...

517
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:36,183
and you won't tell me what's going on? I am worried sick, dear.

518
01:16:36,776 --> 01:16:38,611
OK.

519
01:16:39,779 --> 01:16:42,714
- OK, here's the number. Ready? - Yes. Go ahead.

520
01:16:42,882 --> 01:16:46,425
It's 408-555...

521
01:16:46,451 --> 01:16:48,643
- 1439. - Uh-huh.

522
01:16:48,686 --> 01:16:50,969
- Room 9. Got it? - Uh-huh.

523
01:16:51,095 --> 01:16:52,923
- I've got it. - I've got to go.

524
01:16:53,091 --> 01:16:57,662
I'm sorry I can't tell you more right now. I love you, mom.

525
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:04,001
I love you, too, sweetheart.

526
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:19,433
Tiki motel. - Give me your address there.

527
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:23,787
What have we got?

528
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:28,942
Mothballs.

529
01:17:29,968 --> 01:17:31,687
Corn syrup.

530
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:35,066
Ammonia. What's for dinner?

531
01:17:35,834 --> 01:17:38,869
- Plastique. - Mmm, that sounds good.

532
01:17:39,037 --> 01:17:40,471
What is it?

533
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:44,908
Nitroglycerin, basically. It's a bit more stable.

534
01:17:44,976 --> 01:17:47,145
I learned to make it when I was a kid.

535
01:17:58,607 --> 01:18:01,126
Make sure there's none on the threads.

536
01:18:02,994 --> 01:18:04,662
Like this.

537
01:18:06,498 --> 01:18:08,533
Screw the end cap on.

538
01:18:10,201 --> 01:18:12,302
Very gently.

539
01:18:14,472 --> 01:18:17,508
You must've had a fun childhood.

540
01:18:20,478 --> 01:18:22,179
That's good.

541
01:18:22,446 --> 01:18:26,984
All right. Six more like that, and I'll get started on the fuses.

542
01:18:37,528 --> 01:18:39,729
He'll find us, won't he?

543
01:18:42,367 --> 01:18:44,034
Probably.

544
01:19:01,751 --> 01:19:04,104
It'll never be over, will it?

545
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,850
Look at me. I'm shaking.

546
01:19:15,617 --> 01:19:21,039
Some legend, huh? You must be pretty disappointed.

547
01:19:21,807 --> 01:19:25,609
No. I'm not.

548
01:19:34,619 --> 01:19:36,186
Kyle...

549
01:19:37,122 --> 01:19:41,758
The women in your time... what are they like?

550
01:19:43,962 --> 01:19:45,897
Good fighters.

551
01:19:46,264 --> 01:19:48,365
That's not what I meant.

552
01:19:50,568 --> 01:19:52,669
Was there someone special?

553
01:19:54,171 --> 01:19:59,275
- Someone? - A girl. You know.

554
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:01,945
No.

555
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:06,166
Never.

556
01:20:07,802 --> 01:20:09,369
Never?

557
01:20:14,308 --> 01:20:17,778
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

558
01:20:20,548 --> 01:20:22,866
So much pain.

559
01:20:23,968 --> 01:20:28,673
Pain can be controlled. You just disconnect it.

560
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:30,891
So you feel nothing?

561
01:20:35,981 --> 01:20:39,049
John Connor gave me a picture of you once.

562
01:20:40,786 --> 01:20:45,822
I didn't know why at the time. It was very old...

563
01:20:46,725 --> 01:20:50,260
Torn... faded.

564
01:20:53,597 --> 01:20:59,804
You were young like you are now. You seemed just... a little sad.

565
01:21:01,206 --> 01:21:04,960
I used to always wonder what you were thinking at that moment.

566
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:07,921
I memorized every line,

567
01:21:09,247 --> 01:21:11,372
every curve.

568
01:21:14,618 --> 01:21:17,471
I came across time for you, Sarah.

569
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:23,027
I love you. I always have.

570
01:21:40,745 --> 01:21:42,546
I shouldn't have said that.

571
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:15,655
Think fast!

572
01:24:44,761 --> 01:24:46,462
Trade places!

573
01:24:57,190 --> 01:25:00,643
Faster! Drive faster!

574
01:25:50,193 --> 01:25:51,727
Kyle!

575
01:25:52,394 --> 01:25:54,029
Oh, my God!

576
01:26:27,748 --> 01:26:29,382
Kyle.

577
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:45,631
- Whoa! - Son of a bitch!

578
01:27:01,064 --> 01:27:02,832
You stay here.

579
01:27:26,273 --> 01:27:28,207
Let's get out of here.

580
01:27:31,244 --> 01:27:32,978
Get out.

581
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:52,782
Kyle. Come on, get up.

582
01:27:58,922 --> 01:28:00,835
He's coming.

583
01:28:00,861 --> 01:28:03,726
Kyle? Come on!

584
01:28:04,827 --> 01:28:08,283
Help me! Get out! Get out!

585
01:28:08,609 --> 01:28:10,181
Get out!

586
01:28:19,442 --> 01:28:21,026
Come on!

587
01:28:27,083 --> 01:28:28,934
Faster!

588
01:28:32,338 --> 01:28:34,823
Don't stop! Run!

589
01:30:46,489 --> 01:30:48,423
Sarah!

590
01:30:48,891 --> 01:30:50,542
Kyle!

591
01:30:55,498 --> 01:30:58,967
Oh, Kyle. Kyle.

592
01:31:00,203 --> 01:31:03,388
We did it, Kyle. We got it.

593
01:31:22,992 --> 01:31:26,545
No!

594
01:32:21,734 --> 01:32:23,535
Wait!

595
01:32:27,907 --> 01:32:33,311
What are you doing? - Cover, so he can't track us.

596
01:32:43,239 --> 01:32:48,076
Come on! Come on. No, Kyle!

597
01:32:49,212 --> 01:32:53,165
- Come on! Come on! - Leave me here.

598
01:32:53,166 --> 01:32:54,767
Get up!

599
01:33:03,976 --> 01:33:08,947
Move it, Reese! On your feet, soldier!

600
01:33:09,014 --> 01:33:12,567
On your feet! Move it!

601
01:34:24,123 --> 01:34:26,224
Back. Go back.

602
01:35:00,310 --> 01:35:02,578
- Run, Sarah. - No.

603
01:35:02,646 --> 01:35:04,179
Run!

604
01:35:07,650 --> 01:35:09,218
Run!

605
01:35:09,485 --> 01:35:11,570
Come on, motherfucker.

606
01:37:04,483 --> 01:37:06,767
No, no.

607
01:39:04,802 --> 01:39:07,070
You're terminated, fucker.

608
01:40:04,661 --> 01:40:06,230
Kyle.

609
01:40:08,334 --> 01:40:14,287
POLICE RADIO: 6450 Bellingham Avenue, Super Trader. 6450 Bellingham Avenue.

610
01:40:27,168 --> 01:40:31,004
Tape 7, November 10. Where was I?

611
01:40:31,972 --> 01:40:36,276
What's most difficult for me is trying to decide what to tell you and what not to.

612
01:40:36,544 --> 01:40:40,898
But I guess I have a while yet before you're old enough to even understand these tapes.

613
01:40:40,966 --> 01:40:45,103
They're more for me at this point, just so that I can get it straight.

614
01:41:15,550 --> 01:41:18,986
- Gasolina, por favor. - ¿Cuánto?

615
01:41:19,454 --> 01:41:23,557
- Llena el tanque. - Fill her up, sí.

616
01:41:27,194 --> 01:41:32,366
Should I tell you about your father? Boy, that's a tough one.

617
01:41:33,668 --> 01:41:38,506
Will it affect your decision to send him here, knowing that he is your father?

618
01:41:40,274 --> 01:41:42,973
If you don't send Kyle, you can never be.

619
01:41:42,977 --> 01:41:46,846
God, a person could go crazy thinking about this.

620
01:41:50,118 --> 01:41:55,689
I suppose I will tell you. I owe him that.

621
01:41:57,992 --> 01:42:00,528
Maybe it'll help if...

622
01:42:00,595 --> 01:42:05,533
You know that in the few hours that we had together...

623
01:42:07,602 --> 01:42:10,171
We loved a lifetime's worth.

624
01:42:13,808 --> 01:42:17,128
Usted es muy hermosa, señora, y tengo pena decirle

625
01:42:17,129 --> 01:42:22,499
que me de cinco dolares americanos, pero si no, mi padre me va a pegar.

626
01:42:23,033 --> 01:42:26,969
- What did he just say? - He says you're very beautiful, señora...

627
01:42:27,037 --> 01:42:30,407
and he's ashamed to ask you for five American dollars for his picture,

628
01:42:30,408 --> 01:42:33,277
but if he doesn't, his father will beat him.

629
01:42:33,445 --> 01:42:35,479
Pretty good hustle, kid.

630
01:42:36,447 --> 01:42:39,216
- Cuatro - Sí, sí.

631
01:42:40,184 --> 01:42:41,585
Gracias.

632
01:42:43,087 --> 01:42:45,088
¡Miren, miren!

633
01:42:47,041 --> 01:42:50,227
¡Allá! ¡Viene una tormenta!

634
01:42:52,462 --> 01:42:54,431
What did he just say?

635
01:42:54,899 --> 01:42:57,551
He said there's a storm coming in.

636
01:43:01,489 --> 01:43:03,156
I know.
