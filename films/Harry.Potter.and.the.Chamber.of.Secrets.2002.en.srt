1
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,200
I can't let you out, Hedwig.

2
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:18,912
I'm not allowed to use magic
outside of school.

3
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:23,292
- Besides, if Uncle Vernon--
- Harry Potter!

4
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,712
Now you've done it.

5
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,219
He's in there. Vernon?

6
00:01:36,555 --> 00:01:40,350
I'm warning you, if you can't control
that bloody bird, it'll have to go.

7
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,352
But she's bored.

8
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:47,024
If I could only let her out
for an hour or two.

9
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,111
So you can send secret messages
to your freaky little friends? No, sir.

10
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,408
But I haven't had any messages
from any of my friends.

11
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,243
Not one...

12
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,120
...all summer.

13
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,540
Who would want to be
friends with you?

14
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:08,253
I should think you'd be
a little more grateful.

15
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,923
We've raised you since you were a baby,
given you the food off our table...

16
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,217
...even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom...

17
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,928
...purely out of the goodness
of our hearts.

18
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,598
Not now.
It's for when the Masons arrive.

19
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,101
Which should be any minute.

20
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,605
Now, let's go over our schedule
once again, shall we?

21
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,732
Petunia, when the Masons arrive,
you will be...?

22
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:32,569
In the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

23
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:36,657
- Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
- I'll be waiting to open the door.

24
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,742
Excellent.

25
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,123
And you?

26
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:50,087
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise
and pretending that I don't exist.

27
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,963
Too right, you will.

28
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,634
With any luck, this could be the day
I make the biggest deal of my career...

29
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:59,388
...and you will not mess it up.

30
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:15,320
Harry Potter, such an honor it is.

31
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:23,120
- Who are you?
- Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.

32
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,205
Not to be rude or anything...

33
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:29,334
...but this isn't a great time for me
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.

34
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,003
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.

35
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,298
It's just that Dobby
has come to tell you...

36
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:40,303
It is difficult, sir.
Dobby wonders where to begin.

37
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:46,309
- Why don't you sit down?
- Sit down? Sit down?

38
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:54,025
Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to offend you or anything.

39
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,361
Offend Dobby?

40
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,864
Dobby has heard
of your greatness, sir...

41
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,828
...but never has he been asked
to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.

42
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:08,373
You can't have met
many decent wizards then.

43
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,001
No, I haven't.

44
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,879
That was an awful thing to say.

45
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:18,008
- Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
- Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.

46
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,551
Dobby, please, stop.

47
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,683
Don't mind that. It's just the cat.

48
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:33,190
- Bad Dobby.
- Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.

49
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,609
Are you all right?

50
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,237
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.

51
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,616
Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family, sir.

52
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:46,745
- Your family?
- The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.

53
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,915
Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.

54
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,626
If they ever knew Dobby was here...

55
00:04:54,252 --> 00:05:00,050
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.

56
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,552
Harry Potter must not go back...

57
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:07,390
...to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.

58
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:12,729
There is a plot, a plot to make
most terrible things happen.

59
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,233
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?

60
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,569
Can't say.

61
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:25,742
- Okay, I understand. You can't say.
- Don't make me talk. I--

62
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,455
- Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down.
- Bad Dobby.

63
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:34,668
So when they arrive
at the ninth hole...

64
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,840
Give me the lamp.

65
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,969
Dobby, stop!

66
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,140
- Let me go.
- Get in there and keep quiet.

67
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:53,353
- What the devil are you doing up here?
- I was just--

68
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:56,273
You just ruined the punch line
of my Japanese golfer joke.

69
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,275
Sorry.

70
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:03,947
One more sound and you'll wish
you'd never been born, boy.

71
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:07,868
- And fix that door.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,788
See why I've got to go back?

73
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:15,709
I don't belong here.
I belong in your world, at Hogwarts.

74
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:20,505
- It's the only place I've got friends.
- Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?

75
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,633
Well, I expect they've been...

76
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,471
Hang on. How do you know
my friends haven't been writing to me?

77
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,975
Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Dobby.

78
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:36,354
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him...

79
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:40,191
...Harry Potter might not want
to go back to school, sir.

80
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:45,822
- Give me those. Now.
- No!

81
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,379
Dobby, get back here.

82
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,886
Dobby, please, no.

83
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:12,223
Harry Potter must say
he's not going back to school.

84
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,018
I can't. Hogwarts is my home.

85
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:21,274
Then Dobby must do it, sir,
for Harry Potter's own good.

86
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:26,446
It spread as far as the eye
could see, all over the floor.

87
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,573
One plumber said,
"Look at all that water."

88
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,743
The second plumber said,
"Yes, and that's just the top of it."

89
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,501
Mr. Mason...

90
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,548
Vernon tells me
that you're a wonderful golfer.

91
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,510
I play. Occasionally.

92
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,345
Hm.

93
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,806
Mrs. Mason...

94
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,558
...where do you get your
beautiful suits?

95
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:59,020
Oh, all of my suits are tailor-made.

96
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,441
Dudley...

97
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,237
...wasn't there something
you wanted to say?

98
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,992
- Pudding.
- Pudding?

99
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,661
What pudding?

100
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:24,879
I'm so sorry. It's my nephew.
He's very disturbed.

101
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:29,384
Meeting strangers upsets him.
That's why I kept him upstairs.

102
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,265
Well, we have ice cream.

103
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,777
You're never going back to that school.

104
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:52,991
You're never going to see those
freaky friends of yours again. Never!

105
00:08:52,991 --> 00:09:22,991
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

106
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,288
Hiya, Harry.

107
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:45,835
Ron. Fred. George.
What are you all doing here?

108
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,881
Rescuing you, of course.
Now, come on, get your trunk.

109
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,306
You better stand back.

110
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,850
Let's go.

111
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,524
- What was that?
- What was it?

112
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,028
Potter!

113
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,863
Dad, what's going on?

114
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,159
Go. Go. Go.

115
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,369
Dad, hurry up.

116
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,414
- Come on.
- Come on, Harry, hurry up.

117
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,210
Petunia, he's escaping!

118
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,922
- I've got you, Harry.
- Come here!

119
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,216
- Let go of me!
- No, boy!

120
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,386
You and that bloody pigeon
aren't going anywhere.

121
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,179
- Get off!
- Drive!

122
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,223
- Right.
- Right!

123
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,058
No! No! No! No!

124
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,231
Dad!

125
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,867
Damn.

126
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,875
By the way, Harry, happy birthday.

127
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,986
Come on.

128
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,616
Okay, come on. Shh, shh.

129
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,660
Okay, come on.

130
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,921
Think it'd be all right
if we had some?

131
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,964
Yeah, Mum will never know.

132
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,859
It's not much, but it's home.

133
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,320
I think it's brilliant.

134
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,824
Where have you been?

135
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,286
Harry, how wonderful
to see you, dear.

136
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,040
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.

137
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:32,210
You could have died.
You could have been seen.

138
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,463
Of course, I don't
blame you, Harry, dear.

139
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,633
They were starving him, Mum.
There were bars on his window.

140
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,554
Well, you best hope I don't put bars
on your window, Ronald Weasley.

141
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,848
Come on, Harry,
time for a spot of breakfast.

142
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,811
Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.

143
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:53,523
That's it. There we go.

144
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,527
- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
- Yes, dear, it was on the cat.

145
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,821
Hello.

146
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,493
What did I do?

147
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,248
Ginny. She's been talking about you
all summer. A bit annoying, really.

148
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,042
- Morning, Weasleys.
- Morning, Dad.

149
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:17,755
- What a night. Nine raids.
- Raids?

150
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,884
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic,
in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.

151
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,388
Dad loves Muggles,
thinks they're fascinating.

152
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,765
Well, now.

153
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,893
And who are you?

154
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:35,231
Oh, sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir.
Harry Potter.

155
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,526
Good Lord. Are you really?

156
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:43,406
Well, Ron has told us all about you,
of course. When did he get here?

157
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,074
This morning.

158
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:50,496
Your sons flew that enchanted car
of yours to Surrey and back last night.

159
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:54,083
Did you really? How did it go?

160
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:59,088
I mean-- That was very wrong
indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.

161
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:04,260
Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.

162
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:08,556
Tell me, what exactly
is the function of a rubber duck?

163
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,059
Oh, um...

164
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,897
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.

165
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,447
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?

166
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:28,034
- Errol.
- He's always doing that.

167
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,623
Oh, look, it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.

168
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,834
Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.

169
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,961
- Oh, no.
- This lot won't come cheap.

170
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:43,466
- The spell books alone are expensive.
- We'll manage.

171
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:48,471
There's only one place we're going to
get all of this. Diagon Alley.

172
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,099
Right.

173
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,351
Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.

174
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,479
But Harry's never traveled
by Floo powder before, Mum.

175
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:57,688
Floo powder?

176
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:02,151
You go first, Ron, so that Harry
can see how it's done. Yes.

177
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,654
In you go.

178
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,697
That's it.

179
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,953
Diagon Alley.

180
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:21,462
You see? It's quite easy, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.

181
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,465
Come on.

182
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,802
In you go. That's it. Mind your head.

183
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:31,389
That's right.
Now, take your Floo powder.

184
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,393
That's it, very good.

185
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,897
Now, don't forget to speak
very, very clearly.

186
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,152
Diagonally.

187
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,994
- What did he say, dear?
- Diagonally.

188
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,245
I thought he did.

189
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,034
Don't touch anything, Draco.

190
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,411
Yes, Father.

191
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:35,346
Master Malfoy,
what a pleasure to see you again.

192
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,891
And young Master Malfoy too.
Delighted.

193
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,103
I must show you, just in today
and very reasonably priced--

194
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,814
I'm not buying today, Borgin,
I'm selling.

195
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,400
- Selling?
- Draco.

196
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,239
You are aware, no doubt,
that the Ministry of Magic...

197
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,492
...is conducting more raids
on private houses.

198
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,662
There's even rumors of a new
Muggle Protection Act.

199
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:04,417
Pure wizard blood is counting for less
everywhere, I'm afraid.

200
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,419
Not with me.

201
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,630
Anyway, I brought
a few items from home...

202
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:14,302
...that might prove, ahem, embarrassing
were the Ministry to call.

203
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,388
Just poisons and the like.

204
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,019
Look at that.

205
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:27,273
That particular item...

206
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,941
...is not for sale.

207
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,027
I understand.

208
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,195
It has unique qualities.

209
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:37,575
One wouldn't want to see it
falling into the wrong hands.

210
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,466
You can keep the box.

211
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,137
What did I say?

212
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,516
Touch nothing.

213
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,269
- Exactly.
- Sorry, Father.

214
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,899
Come on, we're going.

215
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:13,652
It's a pleasure to do business
with you, Mr. Malfoy.

216
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,030
Always a pleasure.

217
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,842
Looking for something?

218
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,761
No, I...

219
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,429
I'm just in the wrong place.

220
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,390
Sorry.

221
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,643
Thank you.

222
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:06,539
- Not lost, are you, my dear?
- I'm fine, thank you. I was just going...

223
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:11,210
Come with us. We'll help you
find your way back.

224
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,296
- No. Please-- Hagrid!
- Harry?

225
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,384
What do you think
you're doing down here? Come on.

226
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:29,478
You're a mess, Harry. Skulking
around Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

227
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,649
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.

228
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,026
I was lost, I--

229
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,155
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?

230
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:44,493
Me? I was... I was looking
for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.

231
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,538
They're ruining all the school cabbages.

232
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,171
Harry. Hagrid.

233
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,755
Hello, Hermione.

234
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,758
- It's so good to see you.
- It's great to see you too.

235
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,012
What did you do to your glasses?

236
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,056
<i>Oculus Reparo.</i>

237
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,271
I definitely need to remember that one.

238
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:16,192
You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Right. I'll leave you to it.

239
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,776
- Okay, bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

240
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,945
Come on, everyone's been so worried.

241
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,790
Oh, Harry.

242
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,211
Thank goodness. We'd hoped
you'd only gone one grate too far.

243
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,214
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.

244
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,674
Here he is.

245
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,263
Mum fancies him.

246
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,725
Make way there, please.
Let me by, madam. Thank you.

247
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:53,312
Excuse me, little girl.
This is for the <i>Daily Prophet.</i>

248
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,402
It can't be. Harry Potter?

249
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,781
Harry Potter!

250
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,199
Excuse me, madam.

251
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,996
Nice big smile, Harry.
Together, you and I rate the front page.

252
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:14,333
Ladies and gentlemen,
what an extraordinary moment this is.

253
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,920
When young Harry stepped
into Flourish and Blotts this morning...

254
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:22,216
...to purchase my autobiography,
<i>Magical Me...</i>

255
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,597
...which, incidentally,
is currently celebrating...

256
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:33,602
...its 27th week atop
the <i>Daily Prophet</i> bestseller list...

257
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:38,274
...he had no idea that he would,
in fact, be leaving...

258
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:44,321
...with my entire collected works...

259
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:47,116
...free of charge.

260
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,537
Now, ladies?

261
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,873
Harry, now you give me those,
and I'll get them signed.

262
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,544
All of you wait outside.
That's it.

263
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,347
I'll bet you loved that,
didn't you, Potter?

264
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:15,019
Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a
bookshop without making the front page.

265
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,354
Leave him alone.

266
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:21,025
Look, Potter.
You've got yourself a girlfriend.

267
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:25,279
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.

268
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,864
Mr. Potter.

269
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:33,329
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.

270
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,664
Forgive me.

271
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,084
Your scar is legend.

272
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,879
As, of course, is the wizard
who gave it to you.

273
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,381
Voldemort killed my parents.

274
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,928
He was nothing more than a murderer.

275
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,891
You must be very brave
to mention his name.

276
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,893
Or very foolish.

277
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:59,855
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

278
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,735
And you must be Miss Granger.

279
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:11,867
Yes, Draco has told me
all about you. And your parents.

280
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,958
Muggles, aren't they?

281
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,050
Let me see.
Red hair, vacant expressions...

282
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,763
...tatty, secondhand book.

283
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,350
You must be the Weasleys.

284
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,769
It's mad in here.
Let's go outside.

285
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:42,648
- Well, Weasley senior.
- Lucius.

286
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:47,569
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur,
all those extra raids?

287
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,072
I do hope they're paying you overtime...

288
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,409
...but judging by the state of this,
I'd say not.

289
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,914
What's the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard...

290
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:01,166
...if they don't even pay you well for it?

291
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:06,463
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

292
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,507
Clearly.

293
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:14,304
Associating with Muggles.

294
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:23,105
And I thought your family
could sink no lower.

295
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,194
I'll see you at work.

296
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,701
See you at school.

297
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,793
10:58, come on.

298
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,211
The train will leave soon.

299
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,673
Fred, George, Percy, you first.

300
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,930
Okay.

301
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,688
After you, dear.

302
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,068
Come on, Ginny,
we'll get you a seat. Hurry.

303
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,572
Let's go.

304
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:30,631
- What do you two think you're doing?
- Sorry.

305
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,092
Lost control of the trolley.

306
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,763
- Why can't we get through?
- I don't know.

307
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,266
The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.

308
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:46,605
The train leaves at exactly 11 :00.
We've missed it.

309
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:50,108
Harry, if we can't get through...

310
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,111
...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

311
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:57,491
Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.

312
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,868
The car.

313
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,127
There we go.

314
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,839
Now, all we need to do is find
the Hogwarts Express.

315
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,592
Ron, are you sure you know
how to fly this?

316
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,678
No problem.

317
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,644
Look out!

318
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,729
Aah!

319
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,026
Ron, I should tell you...

320
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:36,989
...most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.

321
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,282
Right.

322
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:39,616
Okay.

323
00:27:56,883 --> 00:28:00,178
Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster
must be faulty.

324
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,807
Come on, then. Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.

325
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,225
Okay.

326
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,196
All we need to do
is catch up with the train.

327
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,032
We can't be far behind.

328
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,745
- Do you hear that?
- We must be getting close.

329
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,331
Hold on.

330
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,776
Harry!

331
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,238
Hold on!

332
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,078
Take my hand!

333
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:11,583
Hold on!

334
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,379
I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.

335
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:31,228
- I think we found the train.
- Yeah.

336
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,204
Welcome home.

337
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,513
Up! Up!

338
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,641
It's not working!

339
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,148
Up! Ron, mind that tree!

340
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,528
Stop! Stop! Stop!

341
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:49,306
- My wand. Look at my wand.
- Be thankful it's not your neck.

342
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:53,894
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

343
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:31,515
Come on, go! Fast!

344
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,635
Scabbers, you're okay.

345
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,222
The car!

346
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,489
Dad's gonna kill me.

347
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,417
See you, Hedwig.

348
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,087
So a house-elf shows up
in my bedroom...

349
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:47,173
...we can't get through the barrier
to platform 9 3/4...

350
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,594
...we almost get killed by a tree...

351
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,306
Clearly someone doesn't want me
here this year.

352
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:00,854
Well, take a good look, lads.

353
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:04,941
This night might well be
the last you spend in this castle.

354
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:11,281
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.

355
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:17,704
You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.

356
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:20,957
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

357
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:25,462
You have risked
the exposure of our world.

358
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:29,049
Not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a Whomping Willow...

359
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:32,427
...that's been on these grounds
since before you were born.

360
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,431
Honestly, Professor Snape,
I think it did more damage to us.

361
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:37,724
Silence.

362
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:46,149
I assure you that were you in Slytherin,
and your fate rested with me...

363
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:50,070
...the both of you would be
on the train home tonight.

364
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,490
- As it is--
- They are not.

365
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,746
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.

366
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,665
Headmaster...

367
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:06,586
...these boys have flouted the Decree
for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.

368
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:10,674
- As such--
- I am well aware of our bylaws...

369
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,718
...having written
quite a few of them myself.

370
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:17,347
However, as head of Gryffindor house...

371
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:22,519
...it is for Professor McGonagall
to determine the appropriate action.

372
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,105
We'll go and get our stuff, then.

373
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,732
What are you
talking about, Mr. Weasley?

374
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,110
You're going to expel us, aren't you?

375
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:34,781
Not today, Mr. Weasley...

376
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:39,995
...but I must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done.

377
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:45,125
I will be writing to your families tonight,
and you will both receive detention.

378
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:50,588
And now I suggest
that we all return to the feast.

379
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:55,427
There is a delicious-looking custard tart
that I am most anxious to sample.

380
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,445
Mr. Filch, you dropped this.

381
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,270
Morning, everyone.

382
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,482
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning, Professor Sprout.

383
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,903
Welcome to Greenhouse Three,
second years. Gather around, everyone.

384
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,906
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.

385
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,909
Who here can tell me
the properties of the Mandrake root?

386
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,995
Yes, Miss Granger?

387
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,498
Mandrake, or Mandragora...

388
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:11,669
...is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.

389
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:16,841
It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

390
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,844
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

391
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,722
As our Mandrakes
are still only seedlings...

392
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,766
...their cries won't kill you yet.

393
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:28,770
But they could knock you out for hours,
which is why I have given you earmuffs...

394
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,438
...for auditory protection.

395
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:35,026
So could you please put them on,
right away? Quickly.

396
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,987
Flaps tight down,
and watch me closely.

397
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:41,157
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.

398
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:44,327
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.

399
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,500
Got it? And...

400
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,836
...now you dunk it down
into the other pot...

401
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:57,757
...and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm.

402
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:04,556
Longbottom's been neglecting
his earmuffs.

403
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:09,018
- No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
- Yes, well, just leave him there.

404
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,981
Right, on we go.
Plenty of pots to go around.

405
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:16,693
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.

406
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:35,420
- There's Nearly Headless Nick.
- Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.

407
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:38,172
Hello, Sir Nicholas.

408
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,896
Say it. I'm doomed.

409
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,690
- You're doomed.
- Hi, Harry.

410
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,612
I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.

411
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,405
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.

412
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,075
Say, do you think your friend here
could take a photo of me and you...

413
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,786
...standing together?
To prove I've met you.

414
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,122
It's for my dad.
He's a milkman, you know.

415
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,583
A Muggle, like all our
family's been until me.

416
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,545
No one knew the stuff I could do was
magic till we got letters from Hogwarts.

417
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,882
- Everyone just thought I was mental.
- Imagine that.

418
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,385
Ron, is that your owl?

419
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,778
Bloody bird's a menace.

420
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,450
Oh, no.

421
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:51,120
Look, everyone.
Weasley's got himself a Howler.

422
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:57,794
Go on, Ron. I ignored one
from my gran once. It was horrible.

423
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,844
<i>Ronald Weasley!</i>

424
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:15,561
<i>How dare you steal that car!
I am absolutely disgusted!</i>

425
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,481
<i>Your father's now facing
an inquiry at work...</i>

426
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:20,984
<i>...and it's entirely your fault!</i>

427
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:25,321
<i>If you put another toe out of line...</i>

428
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,741
<i>...we'll bring you straight home!</i>

429
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:33,037
<i>And, Ginny, dear, congratulations
on making Gryffindor.</i>

430
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,958
<i>Your father and I are so proud.</i>

431
00:39:55,184 --> 00:40:01,607
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

432
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,359
Me.

433
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,029
Gilderoy Lockhart...

434
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:09,532
...Order of Merlin, Third Class...

435
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:13,036
...honorary member
of the Dark Force Defense League...

436
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,080
...and five times winner...

437
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:22,295
...of <i>Witch Weekly's</i>
Most-Charming-Smile Award.

438
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,213
But I don't talk about that.

439
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,885
I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee
by smiling at him.

440
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,142
I see you've bought a complete set
of my books. Well done.

441
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:40,438
Now, I thought we'd start today
with a little quiz.

442
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,651
Nothing to worry about.

443
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:49,447
Just to check how well
you've read them.

444
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,199
Thank you.

445
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:55,703
How much you've taken in.

446
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:04,212
Look at these questions.
They're all about him.

447
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:07,548
"What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
favorite color?"

448
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:12,720
"What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
greatest achievement to date?"

449
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,476
You have 30 minutes. Start...

450
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:23,481
...now!

451
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,489
Tut-tut.

452
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:35,785
Hardly any of you remembered
that my favorite color is lilac.

453
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,995
But Miss Hermione Granger...

454
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:42,917
...knew that my secret ambition
is to rid the world of evil...

455
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:46,671
...and market my own range
of hair-care potions. Good girl.

456
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,008
Now, be warned.

457
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:53,302
It is my job to arm you...

458
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:58,808
...against the foulest creatures
known to wizard kind.

459
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:03,229
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.

460
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:07,441
Know only that no harm
can befall you whilst I am here.

461
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,570
I must ask you not to scream.

462
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,281
It might provoke them.

463
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:18,286
Cornish pixies?

464
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:21,539
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

465
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,417
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...

466
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:28,754
...but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters.

467
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,841
Let's see what you make of them.

468
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:39,432
Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.

469
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:59,327
- You just stay there!
- Please, get me down!

470
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,123
- Get off me!
- Stop. Hold still!

471
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,961
<i>Peskipiksi Pesternomi!</i>

472
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:33,235
I'll ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their cage.

473
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:37,156
What do we do now?

474
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,159
<i>Immobulus!</i>

475
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,879
Why is it always me?

476
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,972
I spent the summer devising
a whole new Quidditch program.

477
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,809
We're gonna train earlier,
harder and longer.

478
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:08,270
What--? I don't believe it.

479
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,776
- Where you think you're going, Flint?
- Quidditch practice.

480
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:18,322
- I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
- Easy, Wood. I've got a note.

481
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,951
Uh-oh. I smell trouble.

482
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:26,080
"I, Professor Severus Snape,
do hereby give the Slytherin team...

483
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:29,750
...permission to practice today, owing
to the need to train their new Seeker."

484
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,586
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

485
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:39,176
- Malfoy?
- That's right.

486
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,138
And that's not all
that's new this year.

487
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:46,434
Those are Nimbus 2001s.
How did you get those?

488
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,644
A gift from Draco's father.

489
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:52,606
You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.

490
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,776
At least no one on the Gryffindor team
had to buy their way in.

491
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,821
They got in on pure talent.

492
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:05,953
No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.

493
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:11,876
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!

494
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,302
You okay, Ron?

495
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,140
Say something.

496
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:36,859
- Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
- No, Colin, get out of the way.

497
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,820
Let's take him to Hagrid's.

498
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,156
He'll know what to do.

499
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:54,376
This calls for
a specialist's equipment.

500
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:01,717
Nothing to do but wait till it stops,
I'm afraid.

501
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:05,554
- Okay.
- Better out than in.

502
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,519
- Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
- Malfoy. He called Hermione...

503
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:16,107
Well, I don't know
exactly what it means.

504
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:22,279
He called me a Mudblood.

505
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,116
- He did not.
- What's a Mudblood?

506
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:30,037
It means "dirty blood." Mudblood's a foul
name for someone who's Muggle-born.

507
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:34,458
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

508
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:39,088
It's not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.

509
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:45,052
See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family...

510
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:49,890
...who think they're better than everyone
else because they're pure-blood.

511
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,725
That's horrible.

512
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,063
It's disgusting.

513
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,733
And it's codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.

514
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:03,237
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today
that's not half-blood or less.

515
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:07,950
More to the point, they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

516
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:10,369
Come here.

517
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:17,918
Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.

518
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,795
Aye?

519
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,762
Harry, Harry, Harry.

520
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,140
Can you possibly imagine...

521
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:34,518
...a better way to serve detention...

522
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:37,855
...than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?

523
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:39,440
Not really.

524
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:45,988
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.

525
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:48,115
Remember that.

526
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,996
<i>Come.</i>

527
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:56,290
<i>Come...</i>

528
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,461
<i>...to me.</i>

529
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,300
- What?
- Sorry?

530
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,471
That voice.

531
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,181
Voice?

532
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:20,356
- Didn't you hear it?
- What are you talking about, Harry?

533
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,568
I think you're getting
a bit drowsy.

534
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:28,822
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.

535
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:32,493
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.

536
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:40,000
Spooky.

537
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,172
<i>Blood.</i>

538
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,884
<i>I smell blood.</i>

539
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:52,179
<i>Let me rip you.</i>

540
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:55,891
<i>Let me kill you.</i>

541
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,186
<i>Kill!</i>

542
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,480
<i>Kill!</i>

543
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,066
- <i>Kill!</i>
- Harry!

544
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:06,735
- Did you hear it?
- Hear what?

545
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:10,364
- That voice.
- Voice? What voice?

546
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:14,493
I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just--

547
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,870
<i>It's time.</i>

548
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:20,207
It's moving.
I think it's going to kill.

549
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:25,129
- Kill?
- Harry, wait! Not so fast!

550
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,781
Strange.

551
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:57,786
- I've never seen spiders act like that.
- I don't like spiders.

552
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,959
What's that?

553
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,923
"The Chamber
of Secrets has been opened.

554
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,967
Enemies of the Heir, beware."

555
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:14,428
It's written in blood.

556
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:19,475
Oh, no.

557
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,482
It's Filch's cat.

558
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,276
It's Mrs. Norris.

559
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:48,087
"Enemies of the Heir, beware."

560
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,965
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

561
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:57,304
What's going on here?
Go on. Make way, make way.

562
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,557
Potter?

563
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,851
What are you...?

564
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,482
Mrs. Norris?

565
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:14,154
- You've murdered my cat.
- No. No.

566
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,823
I'll kill you.

567
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,994
- I'll kill you!
- Argus!

568
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,540
Argus, I...

569
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:31,171
Everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately.

570
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,882
Everyone except...

571
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:36,885
...you three.

572
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,765
Ravenclaws, follow me.

573
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:47,521
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.

574
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:50,524
Ah. Thought so.
So unlucky I wasn't there.

575
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:53,902
I know exactly the counter curse
that could've spared her.

576
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,866
But how she has been Petrified,
I cannot say.

577
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:01,869
Ask him.
It's him that's done it.

578
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,705
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

579
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:08,959
It's not true, sir. I swear.
I never touched Mrs. Norris.

580
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:13,589
- Rubbish.
- If I might, headmaster?

581
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:18,886
Perhaps Potter and his friends were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

582
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,263
However...

583
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:24,558
...the circumstances are suspicious.

584
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:29,396
I, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.

585
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,773
I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.

586
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,402
You see, Harry was helping me
answer my fan mail.

587
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,822
That's why Ron and I
went looking for him, professor.

588
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,742
We'd just found him when he said...

589
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:47,831
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- When I said I wasn't hungry.

590
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:53,253
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.

591
00:52:55,589 --> 00:53:01,094
- Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
- My cat has been Petrified.

592
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:07,768
- I want to see some punishment!
- We will be able to cure her, Argus.

593
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:13,482
As I understand it, Madam Sprout
has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

594
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:18,111
When matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris.

595
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,113
And in the meantime...

596
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:24,660
...I strongly recommend caution...

597
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,329
...to all.

598
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,802
- It's a bit strange, isn't it?
- Strange?

599
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:44,721
You hear this voice,
a voice only you can hear...

600
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:49,643
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. It's just strange.

601
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:53,021
Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, I mean?

602
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,648
Are you mad?

603
00:53:54,815 --> 00:54:00,320
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
hearing voices isn't a good sign.

604
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,825
She's right, you know.

605
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,498
Could I have
your attention, please?

606
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:17,504
Right. Now, today,
we will be transforming animals...

607
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,048
...into water goblets.

608
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:22,676
Like so.

609
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:27,723
One, two, three.
<i>Vera Verto.</i>

610
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:35,188
Now it's your turn.
Who would like to go first?

611
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:40,736
Mr. Weasley.
"One, two, three. <i>Vera Verto."</i>

612
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,408
<i>Vera Verto!</i>

613
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,208
That wand needs
replacing, Mr. Weasley.

614
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,712
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- Professor...

615
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:03,091
...I was wondering if you could tell us
about the Chamber of Secrets.

616
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,557
Very well.

617
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:14,061
You all know, of course...

618
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:18,065
...that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago...

619
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:22,653
...by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:

620
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:26,573
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...

621
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:32,412
...Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.

622
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:39,086
Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.

623
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:42,255
- One did not.
- Three guesses who.

624
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,425
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective...

625
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:48,762
...about the students admitted
to Hogwarts.

626
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:53,517
He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.

627
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,811
In other words, pure-bloods.

628
00:55:56,186 --> 00:56:01,525
Unable to sway the others,
he decided to leave the school.

629
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:04,611
Now, according to legend...

630
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:08,490
...Slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle...

631
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:12,327
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.

632
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:16,957
Though, shortly before departing,
he sealed it...

633
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:21,211
...until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.

634
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,797
The Heir alone...

635
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:26,633
...would be able to open the Chamber...

636
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:31,513
...and unleash the horror within,
and by so doing...

637
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,058
...purge the school
of all those who...

638
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:40,230
...in Slytherin's view,
were unworthy to study magic.

639
00:56:40,856 --> 00:56:42,983
Muggle-borns.

640
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:47,654
Naturally, the school
has been searched many times.

641
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:51,324
No such chamber has been found.

642
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:56,538
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?

643
00:56:57,372 --> 00:57:00,000
The Chamber is said to be home
to something...

644
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:03,712
...that only the Heir of Slytherin
can control.

645
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:08,008
It is said to be the home...

646
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,760
...of a monster.

647
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:19,186
Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

648
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:23,565
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.

649
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:27,569
If there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it has been opened, that means--

650
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:31,698
The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

651
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:36,244
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

652
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:39,080
- If you're talking about Malfoy--
- Of course. You heard him.

653
00:57:39,247 --> 00:57:40,957
"You'll be next, Mudbloods."

654
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,752
I heard him.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?

655
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:47,088
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
I mean, look at his family.

656
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:50,050
The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.

657
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:53,637
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.

658
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:58,266
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.

659
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,268
Mind you, it would be difficult.

660
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,480
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules...

661
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:08,109
...and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.

662
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:17,410
Here it is. The Poly juice Potion.

663
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:20,288
"Properly brewed, the Poly juice Potion
allows the drinker...

664
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:24,751
...to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another."

665
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:28,672
You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff,
we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

666
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:32,259
- Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
- Exactly.

667
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:36,263
But it's tricky. I've never seen
a more complicated potion.

668
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:39,558
- How long will it take to make?
- A month.

669
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,351
A month?

670
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:45,355
But, Hermione,
if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...

671
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:48,775
...he could attack half
the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

672
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,819
I know.

673
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:53,822
But it's the only plan we've got.

674
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:46,207
Another goal for Slytherin!

675
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,921
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.

676
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,673
Yeah!

677
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,717
Yeah!

678
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:22,285
All right there, Scarhead?

679
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,919
Watch yourself, Harry!

680
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,088
Wood, look out!

681
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:42,722
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:42,722
...

682
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:11,042
That's been tampered with, that has.

683
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,086
I'll stop it.

684
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:17,882
No! Even with a proper wand,
it's too risky. You could hit Harry.

685
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:45,493
Training for the ballet, Potter?

686
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:18,735
You'll never catch me, Potter.

687
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:50,577
Let's go.

688
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:55,957
<i>Harry Potter has caught
the Snitch. Gryffindor wins!</i>

689
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,340
<i>Finite Incantatem!</i>

690
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:12,724
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?

691
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:14,976
No. I think my arm is broken.

692
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:17,645
Not to worry. I will fix
that arm of yours straightaway.

693
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:22,066
- No. Not you.
- Boy doesn't know what he's saying.

694
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:25,778
This won't hurt a bit.

695
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:34,913
<i>Brackium Emendo!</i>

696
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:46,007
Yes, well,
that can sometimes happen...

697
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:48,426
...but the point is...

698
01:04:49,802 --> 01:04:53,932
...you can no longer feel any pain, and,
very clearly, the bones are not broken.

699
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:56,768
Broken? There's no bones left.

700
01:04:58,478 --> 01:05:00,438
Much more flexible, though.

701
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:06,819
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.
You can go. Out of my way.

702
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,947
Should have been brought
straight to me.

703
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:11,658
I can mend bones in a heartbeat,
but growing them back...

704
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,326
You will be able to, won't you?

705
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:16,621
I'll be able to, certainly.
But it'll be painful.

706
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:21,960
You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

707
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:27,840
What do you expect?
Pumpkin juice?

708
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:36,224
<i>Kill.</i>

709
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,643
<i>Kill.</i>

710
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:47,193
<i>Time to kill.</i>

711
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:54,367
Hello.

712
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,203
Dobby?

713
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,706
Harry Potter should have listened
to Dobby.

714
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:03,876
Harry Potter should have gone back home
when he missed the train.

715
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:08,673
It was you. You stopped the barrier
from letting Ron and me through.

716
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:11,968
Indeed. Yes, sir.

717
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:18,016
- You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
- At least you would be away from here.

718
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:20,852
Harry Potter must go home.

719
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:24,564
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see--

720
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:28,109
Your Bludger? You made
that Bludger chase after me?

721
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:31,863
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.

722
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:35,700
Dobby had to iron his hands.

723
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:42,498
You better clear off before my bones
come back, or I might strangle you.

724
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:47,086
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.

725
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:50,298
Dobby gets them five times a day
at home.

726
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:53,259
I don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?

727
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:57,430
Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.

728
01:06:57,597 --> 01:07:00,933
Dobby remembers how it was
before Harry Potter triumphed...

729
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:04,228
...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

730
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:08,107
We house-elves were
treated like vermin, sir.

731
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:13,738
Of course, Dobby is still
treated like vermin.

732
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:25,666
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

733
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:30,963
This, sir? It is a mark
of the house-elf's enslavement.

734
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:35,593
Dobby can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes.

735
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:39,764
Listen.

736
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:41,474
Listen!

737
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:45,353
Terrible things are
about to happen at Hogwarts.

738
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:48,439
Harry Potter must not stay here...

739
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:53,152
...now that history
is to repeat itself.

740
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:56,781
Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?

741
01:07:56,948 --> 01:07:58,950
I shouldn't have said that.

742
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:05,832
- Bad Dobby! Bad!
- Stop it!

743
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:07,667
Stop it, Dobby!

744
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:13,172
Tell me. When did this happen before?
Who's doing it now?

745
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:18,553
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby
only wants Harry Potter to be safe.

746
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:21,013
No, Dobby. Tell me.
Who is it?

747
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:34,610
Put him here.

748
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:40,199
What happened?

749
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,160
There's been another attack.

750
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:48,040
I think he's been Petrified,
Madam Pomfrey.

751
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:53,546
Look. Perhaps he managed
to take a picture of his attacker.

752
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,390
What can this mean, Albus?

753
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,517
It means...

754
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:09,687
...that our students
are in great danger.

755
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:13,232
- What should I tell the staff?
- The truth.

756
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:17,278
Tell them Hogwarts
is no longer safe.

757
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,573
It is as we feared, Minerva.

758
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:25,369
The Chamber of Secrets
has indeed been opened again.

759
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:32,376
You mean the Chamber
of Secrets has been opened before?

760
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,254
Of course.
Don't you see?

761
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:38,424
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it
when he was at school here.

762
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:41,636
- Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
- Maybe.

763
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:44,972
We'll have to wait for
the Poly juice Potion to know for sure.

764
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:49,101
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight...

765
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:53,231
...in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?

766
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:56,776
No. No one ever comes in here.

767
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:00,196
- Why?
- Moaning Myrtle.

768
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:01,864
Who?

769
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,450
Moaning Myrtle.

770
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:08,079
- Who's Moaning Myrtle?
- I'm Moaning Myrtle.

771
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:16,420
I wouldn't expect you to know me.

772
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:19,590
Who would ever talk
about ugly, miserable...

773
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:23,135
...moping Moaning Myrtle?

774
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:32,478
She's a little sensitive.

775
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:38,943
Gather round!

776
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:44,282
Gather round.
Can everybody see me?

777
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:47,618
Can you all hear me?

778
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:49,620
Excellent.

779
01:10:50,121 --> 01:10:53,791
In light of the dark events
of recent weeks...

780
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:58,629
...Professor Dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this Dueling Club...

781
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:03,467
...to train you all up in case
you ever need to defend yourselves...

782
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:06,304
...as I myself have done
on countless occasions.

783
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:10,141
For full details,
see my published works.

784
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:18,482
That Lockhart's something, isn't he?
Awfully brave chap.

785
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:19,942
Justin Finch-Fletchley.

786
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,861
- Hufflepuff.
- Nice to meet you. I'm--

787
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:25,281
I know who you are.
We all do, even us Muggle-borns.

788
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:28,576
Let me introduce my assistant...

789
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:31,412
...Professor Snape.

790
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:37,501
He has sportingly agreed to help
with a short demonstration.

791
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:39,754
I don't want any of you
youngsters to worry.

792
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:44,800
You'll still have your Potions master
when I'm through with him. Never fear.

793
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:02,068
One.

794
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:03,277
Two.

795
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:07,114
- Three!
- <i>Expelliarmus!</i>

796
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:18,376
- Do you think he's all right?
- Who cares?

797
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:21,504
An excellent idea to show them that,
Professor Snape...

798
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:26,217
...but if you don't mind me saying, it was
obvious what you were about to do.

799
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:29,637
If I had wanted to stop you,
it would have been only too easy.

800
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:33,307
Perhaps it would be prudent
to first teach the students...

801
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:37,978
...to block unfriendly spells,
professor.

802
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:42,149
An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.

803
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:47,655
Let's have a volunteer pair.
Potter, Weasley, how about you?

804
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:51,325
Weasley's wand causes
devastation with the simplest spells.

805
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:55,413
We'll be sending Potter
to the hospital wing in a matchbox.

806
01:12:55,579 --> 01:12:59,667
Might I suggest someone
from my own house?

807
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,462
Malfoy, perhaps?

808
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:13,472
- Good luck, Potter.
- Thank you, sir.

809
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,399
Wands at the ready.

810
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:27,027
- Scared, Potter?
- You wish.

811
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,123
On the count of three...

812
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:43,627
...cast your charms to disarm
your opponent. Only to disarm.

813
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:47,381
We don't want any accidents here.
One.

814
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:51,719
- Two.
- <i>Everte Statum!</i>

815
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:05,566
<i>Rictusempra!</i>

816
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:18,329
I said disarm only.

817
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,539
<i>Serpensortia!</i>

818
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,967
Don't move, Potter.
I'll get rid of it for you.

819
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:37,598
Allow me, Professor Snape.
<i>Alarte Ascendare!</i>

820
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,810
<i>Vipera Evanesca.</i>

821
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:31,860
What are you playing at?

822
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:47,334
You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?

823
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:49,753
- I'm a what?
- You can talk to snakes.

824
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:55,259
I know. I accidentally set a python
on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.

825
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:59,388
Once. But so what?
I bet loads of people here can do it.

826
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:03,350
No, they can't.
It's not a very common gift, Harry.

827
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:05,519
This is bad.

828
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:09,440
What's bad? If I hadn't told
that snake not to attack Justin--

829
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:13,068
- That's what you said to it.
- You were there. You heard me.

830
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:17,114
I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.

831
01:16:17,281 --> 01:16:20,200
I spoke a different language?

832
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,621
But I didn't realize--

833
01:16:23,787 --> 01:16:26,582
How can I speak a language
without knowing I can?

834
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:30,753
I don't know, but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something.

835
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:32,671
Harry, listen to me.

836
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:35,924
There's a reason the symbol
of Slytherin house is a serpent.

837
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:40,596
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could talk to snakes too.

838
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:41,889
Exactly.

839
01:16:42,056 --> 01:16:45,434
Now the whole school's gonna think
you're his great-great-great grandson.

840
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,603
But I'm not.

841
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:52,274
I can't be.

842
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,444
He lived a thousand years ago.

843
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,822
For all we know, you could be.

844
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:15,673
Who am I, Hedwig?

845
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:18,384
What am I?

846
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:56,505
I'll see you back in the common room.

847
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:14,356
So anyway, I told Justin
to hide up in our dormitory.

848
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:18,902
I mean to say, if Potter has
marked him down as his next victim...

849
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:21,655
...it's best he keeps a low profile
for a while.

850
01:18:21,822 --> 01:18:24,575
But why would he want
to attack Justin?

851
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:29,496
Well, Justin let it slip to Potter
that he was Muggle-born.

852
01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:33,500
And you definitely think Potter
is the Heir of Slytherin?

853
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:37,004
Hannah, he's a Parselmouth.

854
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:39,882
Everyone knows that's the mark
of a dark wizard.

855
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:44,178
Have you ever heard of a decent one
who could talk to snakes?

856
01:18:44,344 --> 01:18:47,514
They called Slytherin himself
"Serpent-tongue."

857
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:50,309
Harry always seemed so nice though.

858
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:54,980
And after all, he is the one who made
You-Know-Who disappear.

859
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:59,443
That's probably why You-Know-Who
wanted to kill him in the first place.

860
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:02,946
Didn't want another Dark Lord
competing with him.

861
01:19:17,544 --> 01:19:19,671
Hello, Harry. You all right?

862
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:22,674
Hagrid. What are you doing here?

863
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:24,927
Second one killed this term.

864
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:28,472
Now, I reckon it's either a fox
or a Blood-Sucking Bugbear.

865
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:31,099
I've been up at Dumbledore's
getting permission...

866
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:33,894
...to put a little charm
round the old hen coop.

867
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:39,233
You sure you're all right?
You're awful hot and bothered.

868
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:41,026
It's nothing.

869
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:45,656
Look, I'd better get going.
I've got a lot of studying to...

870
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:06,718
<i>I want blood.</i>

871
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:14,601
<i>They all must die.</i>

872
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:17,187
<i>Kill.</i>

873
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:19,982
<i>Kill.</i>

874
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:23,026
<i>Kill.</i>

875
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:27,406
<i>Time to kill.</i>

876
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:03,567
Caught in the act.

877
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:05,652
I'll have you out this time, Potter.

878
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:08,655
Mark my words.

879
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:13,076
No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand--

880
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:41,772
Professor...

881
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:43,315
...I swear I didn't.

882
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,777
This is out of my hands, Potter.

883
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:59,081
Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.

884
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:10,592
Sherbet Lemon.

885
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:46,670
Professor Dumbledore?

886
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:05,856
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

887
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:13,238
I was just wondering
if you put me in the right house.

888
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:18,869
Yes. You were particularly
difficult to place.

889
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:22,581
But I stand by what I said last year.

890
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:26,126
You would have done well in Slytherin.

891
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:27,669
You're wrong.

892
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:58,325
Harry?

893
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:00,952
Professor.

894
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:04,915
Your bird...
There was nothing I could do.

895
01:24:05,499 --> 01:24:08,835
- He just caught fire.
- And about time too.

896
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,005
He's been looking dreadful for days.

897
01:24:12,214 --> 01:24:14,216
Pity you had to see him
on a burning day.

898
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:19,346
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.

899
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:22,849
They burst into flame
when it is time for them to die...

900
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:25,143
...and then they are...

901
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:28,355
...reborn from the ashes.

902
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:39,366
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.

903
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:43,703
They can carry immensely heavy loads.

904
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:46,748
Their tears have healing powers.

905
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:52,379
Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Wait! Listen!

906
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:55,507
Professor Dumbledore, sir,
it wasn't Harry.

907
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:58,635
- Hagrid--
- I'd swear it in front of the Ministry.

908
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:00,637
Hagrid.

909
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:02,889
Relax.

910
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:05,642
I do not believe...

911
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:10,272
- ...that Harry attacked anyone.
- Of course you don't.

912
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:12,858
Oh.

913
01:25:13,024 --> 01:25:15,652
Right. Well, I'll...

914
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:18,905
- I'll just wait outside, then.
- Yes.

915
01:25:22,576 --> 01:25:26,246
- You don't think it was me, professor?
- No, Harry.

916
01:25:26,413 --> 01:25:28,915
I do not think it was you.

917
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,793
But I must ask you...

918
01:25:32,335 --> 01:25:36,423
...is there something
you wish to tell me?

919
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:44,931
No, sir.

920
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:46,600
Nothing.

921
01:25:49,603 --> 01:25:51,771
Very well, then.

922
01:25:51,938 --> 01:25:53,690
Off you go.

923
01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:15,503
Hey, look, everyone.
It's the Heir of Slytherin.

924
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:19,925
Be careful.
He's a seriously evil wizard.

925
01:26:20,884 --> 01:26:23,887
Oh, come on, Harry. Fred and George
were just having a laugh.

926
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:26,264
They're the only ones.

927
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:30,518
Half the school thinks you're nipping off
to the Chamber of Secrets every night.

928
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:31,770
Who cares?

929
01:26:32,395 --> 01:26:33,855
Maybe they're right.

930
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:39,194
Harry. Harry!

931
01:26:40,403 --> 01:26:41,821
Oh, come on.

932
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:44,783
Look, I didn't know I could speak
Parseltongue.

933
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:48,161
What else don't I know about myself?

934
01:26:49,496 --> 01:26:51,081
Look...

935
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:55,460
...maybe you can do something...

936
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:58,129
...even something horrible...

937
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:00,173
...and not know you did it.

938
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:03,718
You don't believe that, Harry.
I know you don't.

939
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:08,306
And if it makes you feel any better,
Malfoy's staying for the holidays too.

940
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:11,267
Why would that make
anyone feel any better?

941
01:27:11,434 --> 01:27:15,647
Because in a few days,
the Poly juice Potion will be ready.

942
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:18,024
In a few days...

943
01:27:18,274 --> 01:27:21,361
...we may truly know
who is the Heir of Slytherin.

944
01:27:47,137 --> 01:27:50,682
Everything's set. We just need a bit
of who you're changing into.

945
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:52,559
Crabbe and Goyle.

946
01:27:52,726 --> 01:27:55,520
We also need to make sure
that the real Crabbe and Goyle...

947
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:58,940
...can't burst in on us
while we're interrogating Malfoy.

948
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,985
- How?
- I've got it all worked out.

949
01:28:02,152 --> 01:28:04,696
I filled these
with a simple Sleeping Draught.

950
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:07,657
Simple, but powerful.

951
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:09,993
Now, once they're asleep...

952
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:13,371
...hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs...

953
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:15,415
...and put on their uniforms.

954
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:18,877
- Whose hair are you ripping out, then?
- I've already got mine.

955
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:22,213
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.

956
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,549
I got this off her robes.

957
01:28:24,716 --> 01:28:27,343
I'm going to go check
on the Poly juice Potion.

958
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:30,221
Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle
find these.

959
01:28:42,358 --> 01:28:44,736
Ron, maybe I should do it.

960
01:28:44,903 --> 01:28:46,988
Yeah. Right.

961
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:51,034
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

962
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:02,754
Cool.

963
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:27,737
How thick could you get?

964
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:29,906
Come on, let's get them.

965
01:29:44,838 --> 01:29:47,215
Well, did you get the hairs?

966
01:29:48,424 --> 01:29:49,801
What are those?

967
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:53,179
Slytherin robes.
I had to sneak them from the laundry.

968
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:56,975
Are we going to drink that?

969
01:29:57,183 --> 01:29:58,226
Mm.

970
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:07,110
We'll have exactly one hour
before we change back into ourselves.

971
01:30:15,285 --> 01:30:17,203
Add the hairs.

972
01:30:20,665 --> 01:30:23,501
Ugh. Essence of Crabbe.

973
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,587
Cheers.

974
01:30:34,304 --> 01:30:36,681
I think I'm gonna be sick.

975
01:30:39,642 --> 01:30:41,477
Me too.

976
01:31:26,356 --> 01:31:28,066
Harry?

977
01:31:28,524 --> 01:31:30,068
Ron.

978
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:33,029
Bloody hell!

979
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:36,074
We still sound like ourselves.

980
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,034
You need to sound more like Crabbe.

981
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:41,454
- Bloody hell.
- Excellent.

982
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:44,290
- But where's Hermione?
- I...

983
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:47,460
I don't think I'm going.
You go on without me.

984
01:31:47,669 --> 01:31:49,379
Hermione, are you okay?

985
01:31:49,545 --> 01:31:52,382
Just go. You're wasting time.

986
01:31:54,425 --> 01:31:56,094
Come on.

987
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:03,476
- The Slytherin common room's this way.
- Okay.

988
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:08,398
Excuse me.

989
01:32:10,233 --> 01:32:12,110
What are you doing d--?

990
01:32:12,276 --> 01:32:14,404
I mean, what are you doing down here?

991
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:18,992
I happen to be a school prefect.

992
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:23,621
You, on the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.

993
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:26,082
What are your names again?

994
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:30,253
- I'm...
- Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been?

995
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:33,423
Pigging out in the Great Hall
all this time?

996
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:37,260
Why are you wearing glasses?

997
01:32:38,094 --> 01:32:40,930
- Reading.
- Reading?

998
01:32:42,098 --> 01:32:44,350
I didn't know you could read.

999
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:49,313
And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?

1000
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,524
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.

1001
01:33:00,324 --> 01:33:02,326
Well, sit down.

1002
01:33:05,121 --> 01:33:08,958
You'd never know the Weasleys
were pure-bloods, the way they behave.

1003
01:33:09,167 --> 01:33:13,004
They're an embarrassment
to the wizarding world. All of them.

1004
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:16,132
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?

1005
01:33:18,342 --> 01:33:20,136
Stomachache.

1006
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:26,976
I'm surprised the <i>Daily Prophet</i>
hasn't done a report on all these attacks.

1007
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:29,562
I suppose Dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up.

1008
01:33:29,812 --> 01:33:32,231
Father always said Dumbledore
was the worst thing...

1009
01:33:32,398 --> 01:33:36,194
- ...that ever happened to this place.
- You're wrong!

1010
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:44,869
What?

1011
01:33:45,036 --> 01:33:48,706
You think there's someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?

1012
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:51,334
Well? Do you?

1013
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:53,711
Harry Potter?

1014
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:01,677
Good one, Goyle.

1015
01:34:01,844 --> 01:34:03,387
You're absolutely right.

1016
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:05,890
Saint Potter.

1017
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:09,685
And people actually think
that he's the Heir of Slytherin?

1018
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:16,067
But then you must have some idea
who's behind it all.

1019
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:19,904
You know I don't, Goyle.
I told you yesterday.

1020
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:23,407
How many times do I have to tell you?

1021
01:34:24,408 --> 01:34:26,244
Is this yours?

1022
01:34:30,706 --> 01:34:33,084
But my father did say this:

1023
01:34:33,459 --> 01:34:36,379
It's been 50 years
since the Chamber was opened.

1024
01:34:36,546 --> 01:34:40,925
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.

1025
01:34:41,217 --> 01:34:45,888
The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died.

1026
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:50,393
So it's only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.

1027
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:52,770
As for me...

1028
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:55,106
...I hope it's Granger.

1029
01:34:55,273 --> 01:34:57,483
What's the matter with you two?

1030
01:34:57,650 --> 01:35:00,153
You're acting very odd.

1031
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:02,572
It's his stomachache.

1032
01:35:02,738 --> 01:35:04,782
Calm down.

1033
01:35:08,953 --> 01:35:10,955
Scar.

1034
01:35:14,584 --> 01:35:15,960
Hair.

1035
01:35:22,133 --> 01:35:24,510
Hey! Where are you going?

1036
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:48,367
That was close.

1037
01:35:48,534 --> 01:35:50,995
Hermione, come out.
We've got loads to tell you.

1038
01:35:51,162 --> 01:35:52,997
Go away.

1039
01:35:53,497 --> 01:35:57,376
Wait till you see. It's awful.

1040
01:35:59,337 --> 01:36:01,088
Hermione?

1041
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:02,882
Are you okay?

1042
01:36:04,967 --> 01:36:06,719
Do you remember me telling you...

1043
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:10,056
...that the Poly juice Potion
was only for human transformations?

1044
01:36:10,223 --> 01:36:14,352
It was cat hair I plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.

1045
01:36:16,729 --> 01:36:18,272
Look at my face.

1046
01:36:19,398 --> 01:36:21,859
Look at your tail.

1047
01:36:28,407 --> 01:36:29,867
Have you spoken to Hermione?

1048
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:32,578
She should be out of hospital
in a few days...

1049
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:35,581
...when she stops coughing up fur balls.

1050
01:36:40,378 --> 01:36:42,088
What's this?

1051
01:36:46,717 --> 01:36:47,760
Yuck!

1052
01:36:47,927 --> 01:36:50,721
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's
flooded the bathroom.

1053
01:37:06,946 --> 01:37:11,075
- Come to throw something else at me?
- Why would I throw something at you?

1054
01:37:11,534 --> 01:37:15,579
Don't ask me. Here I am,
minding my own business...

1055
01:37:15,746 --> 01:37:19,417
...and someone thinks it's funny
to throw a book at me.

1056
01:37:19,583 --> 01:37:22,461
But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you.

1057
01:37:22,628 --> 01:37:25,089
I mean, it'll just go
right through you.

1058
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:30,469
Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle
because she can't feel it.

1059
01:37:30,636 --> 01:37:33,264
Ten points
if you get it through her stomach!

1060
01:37:33,431 --> 01:37:36,934
Fifty points if it goes through her head!

1061
01:37:37,435 --> 01:37:41,856
- But who threw it at you, anyway?
- I don't know. I didn't see them.

1062
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:46,444
I was just sitting in the U-bend,
thinking about death...

1063
01:37:46,652 --> 01:37:50,323
...and it fell through the top
of my head. Uh-huh.

1064
01:38:09,175 --> 01:38:11,344
There's a name in this diary.

1065
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:15,973
"Tom Marvolo Riddle."

1066
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:18,017
Tom Marvolo Riddle?

1067
01:38:19,769 --> 01:38:22,646
Hang on. I know that name.

1068
01:38:22,813 --> 01:38:25,316
Why do I know that name?

1069
01:38:25,483 --> 01:38:28,611
Of course. That night I had detention.

1070
01:38:28,778 --> 01:38:31,947
My job was to polish the silver
in the trophy room.

1071
01:38:32,114 --> 01:38:33,741
I remember...

1072
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:36,994
...because I kept burping up slugs
over Tom Riddle's trophy.

1073
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:41,582
- What was the trophy for?
- He won an award 50 years ago.

1074
01:38:41,749 --> 01:38:44,251
Special services to the school
or something.

1075
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:46,045
Fifty years ago? Are you sure?

1076
01:38:46,212 --> 01:38:47,630
Yeah. Why?

1077
01:38:48,214 --> 01:38:50,216
Don't you remember
what Malfoy told you?

1078
01:38:50,383 --> 01:38:53,094
- Last time the Chamber was opened--
- Fifty years ago.

1079
01:38:53,677 --> 01:38:55,513
- That means--
- Tom Riddle was here...

1080
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:57,723
...at Hogwarts when it happened.

1081
01:38:57,890 --> 01:39:00,559
What if he wrote about what he saw?

1082
01:39:00,726 --> 01:39:04,355
It's possible he knew where
the Chamber was. How to open it.

1083
01:39:04,522 --> 01:39:07,400
Even what sort of creature lives in it.

1084
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:10,277
If so, whoever's behind
these attacks...

1085
01:39:10,444 --> 01:39:13,989
...wouldn't want this diary
lying around, would they?

1086
01:39:14,365 --> 01:39:18,369
It's a brilliant theory, Hermione,
but there's just one flaw.

1087
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:21,831
There's nothing written in this diary.

1088
01:39:41,308 --> 01:39:43,018
Do you mind?

1089
01:39:50,609 --> 01:39:53,112
"Tom Marvolo Riddle."

1090
01:40:22,975 --> 01:40:25,311
My name...

1091
01:40:25,478 --> 01:40:28,397
...is Harry...

1092
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:32,151
...Potter.

1093
01:40:45,372 --> 01:40:50,544
Do you know anything...

1094
01:40:51,378 --> 01:40:57,468
...about the Chamber of Secrets?

1095
01:41:08,187 --> 01:41:10,105
Can you...

1096
01:41:11,357 --> 01:41:13,692
...tell me?

1097
01:42:15,921 --> 01:42:19,383
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what's going on here?

1098
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:25,139
Are you Tom Riddle?

1099
01:42:25,306 --> 01:42:27,099
Hello, can you hear me?

1100
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:49,455
Riddle!

1101
01:42:49,997 --> 01:42:51,540
Come.

1102
01:42:51,707 --> 01:42:53,709
Professor Dumbledore.

1103
01:42:55,919 --> 01:42:58,047
Dumbledore?

1104
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:02,843
It is not wise to be wandering around
this late hour, Tom.

1105
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:06,347
Yes, professor. I suppose I...

1106
01:43:06,513 --> 01:43:08,682
I had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.

1107
01:43:09,308 --> 01:43:12,186
I'm afraid they are, Tom.
They are true.

1108
01:43:12,353 --> 01:43:15,189
About the school as well?
I don't have a home to go to.

1109
01:43:15,356 --> 01:43:18,192
They wouldn't really close Hogwarts,
would they, professor?

1110
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:20,944
I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid...

1111
01:43:21,695 --> 01:43:24,657
...Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.

1112
01:43:24,823 --> 01:43:29,328
Sir, if it all stopped,
if the person responsible was caught...

1113
01:43:31,538 --> 01:43:33,666
Is there something...

1114
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:36,585
...you wish to tell me?

1115
01:43:37,836 --> 01:43:40,339
No, sir. Nothing.

1116
01:43:47,096 --> 01:43:50,182
Very well, then. <i>Off</i> you go.

1117
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:52,184
Good night, sir.

1118
01:44:28,303 --> 01:44:31,223
- Let's get you out of there.
- Evening, Hagrid.

1119
01:44:31,557 --> 01:44:35,894
I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't
think you meant it to kill anyone...

1120
01:44:36,061 --> 01:44:38,397
You can't. You don't understand.

1121
01:44:38,564 --> 01:44:41,734
The dead girl's parents will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...

1122
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:44,778
...is make sure the thing that killed
their daughter is slaughtered.

1123
01:44:45,070 --> 01:44:48,157
It wasn't him.
Aragog never killed no one. Never.

1124
01:44:48,532 --> 01:44:50,659
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.

1125
01:44:50,826 --> 01:44:52,453
- Now, stand aside.
- No!

1126
01:44:52,619 --> 01:44:54,580
- Stand aside, Hagrid.
- No!

1127
01:44:54,747 --> 01:44:56,415
<i>Cistern Aperio!</i>

1128
01:45:03,338 --> 01:45:05,674
<i>Arania Exumai!</i>

1129
01:45:06,592 --> 01:45:08,010
Aragog!

1130
01:45:08,177 --> 01:45:09,428
Aragog!

1131
01:45:09,970 --> 01:45:11,346
I can't let you go.

1132
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:15,184
They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
You'll be expelled.

1133
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:19,605
Hagrid!

1134
01:45:25,152 --> 01:45:29,198
Hagrid!

1135
01:45:41,126 --> 01:45:42,961
Whoa.

1136
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:51,178
Ron. Ron, wake up.

1137
01:45:52,179 --> 01:45:54,389
What? What happened?

1138
01:45:54,556 --> 01:45:58,727
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened
the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.

1139
01:46:12,699 --> 01:46:13,742
It was Hagrid.

1140
01:46:13,909 --> 01:46:16,620
It can't be Hagrid.
It just can't be.

1141
01:46:16,829 --> 01:46:20,874
We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch.

1142
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:24,545
The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
What would any of us have done?

1143
01:46:24,878 --> 01:46:28,841
Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't
we just go and ask him about it?

1144
01:46:29,049 --> 01:46:31,718
That would be a cheerful visit.
"Hello, Hagrid.

1145
01:46:31,885 --> 01:46:35,722
Tell us, have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"

1146
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:39,059
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking
about me, now, would you?

1147
01:46:39,351 --> 01:46:40,394
No.

1148
01:46:44,898 --> 01:46:46,567
What's that you've got, Hagrid?

1149
01:46:46,984 --> 01:46:51,572
It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.

1150
01:46:51,738 --> 01:46:55,409
Now, according to Professor Sprout,
they've still got a bit of growing to do.

1151
01:46:55,576 --> 01:46:59,079
But once their acne's cleared up,
we'll chop them up and stew them...

1152
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:02,499
...and then we'll get those people
down at the hospital un-Petrified.

1153
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:06,837
In the meantime, though, you three...

1154
01:47:07,004 --> 01:47:10,173
...had best be looking after yourselves.
All right?

1155
01:47:11,884 --> 01:47:13,802
Hm.

1156
01:47:18,098 --> 01:47:19,975
Hello, Neville.

1157
01:47:21,101 --> 01:47:23,604
Harry, I don't know who did it,
but you'd better come.

1158
01:47:23,937 --> 01:47:25,647
Come on!

1159
01:47:48,211 --> 01:47:52,215
It had to be a Gryffindor.
Nobody else knows our password.

1160
01:47:52,424 --> 01:47:54,635
Unless it wasn't a student.

1161
01:47:54,801 --> 01:47:58,221
Whoever it was, they must have
been looking for something.

1162
01:47:58,430 --> 01:47:59,806
And they found it.

1163
01:48:00,557 --> 01:48:03,060
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.

1164
01:48:04,645 --> 01:48:05,979
All right, listen up.

1165
01:48:06,146 --> 01:48:09,024
We play our game,
Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.

1166
01:48:09,191 --> 01:48:11,068
We're stronger, quicker and smarter.

1167
01:48:11,234 --> 01:48:14,237
Not to mention they're dead scared
that Harry will Petrify them...

1168
01:48:14,446 --> 01:48:17,950
- ...if they fly anywhere near him.
- Well, that too.

1169
01:48:19,159 --> 01:48:20,661
Professor McGonagall.

1170
01:48:20,827 --> 01:48:23,872
- This match has been canceled.
- We can't cancel Quidditch.

1171
01:48:24,039 --> 01:48:29,002
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates
will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.

1172
01:48:29,169 --> 01:48:31,838
Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley.

1173
01:48:32,214 --> 01:48:34,758
There's something
the both of you have to see.

1174
01:48:36,843 --> 01:48:40,472
I warn you.
This could be a wee bit of a shock.

1175
01:48:48,855 --> 01:48:50,023
Hermione!

1176
01:48:50,190 --> 01:48:53,068
She was found near the library...

1177
01:48:53,235 --> 01:48:55,278
...along with this.

1178
01:48:56,738 --> 01:48:59,574
Does it mean anything to either of you?

1179
01:48:59,741 --> 01:49:01,201
No.

1180
01:49:15,424 --> 01:49:17,759
Could I have your attention, please?

1181
01:49:17,926 --> 01:49:23,557
Because of recent events, these new
rules will be put into effect immediately:

1182
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:29,062
"All students will return to their house
common rooms by 6:00 every evening.

1183
01:49:29,229 --> 01:49:33,275
All students will be escorted
to each lesson by a teacher.

1184
01:49:33,442 --> 01:49:36,445
No exceptions."

1185
01:49:37,112 --> 01:49:39,156
I should tell you this:

1186
01:49:39,322 --> 01:49:43,452
Unless the culprit
behind these attacks is caught...

1187
01:49:44,036 --> 01:49:47,164
...it is likely the school will be closed.

1188
01:49:58,675 --> 01:50:01,636
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
I can't believe it's him...

1189
01:50:01,803 --> 01:50:04,097
...but if he did set the monster loose
last time...

1190
01:50:04,264 --> 01:50:07,434
...he'll know how to get inside
the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.

1191
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:08,852
But you heard McGonagall.

1192
01:50:09,061 --> 01:50:12,314
We're not allowed to leave
the tower except for class.

1193
01:50:12,773 --> 01:50:15,275
I think it's time to get
my dad's old cloak out again.

1194
01:50:24,993 --> 01:50:27,245
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1195
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:48,642
Who's there?

1196
01:50:52,395 --> 01:50:53,980
Hello?

1197
01:50:54,648 --> 01:50:56,149
Hello?

1198
01:50:57,317 --> 01:51:01,655
- What's that for?
- Nothing. I was expecting, uh...

1199
01:51:01,822 --> 01:51:05,659
It doesn't matter. Come on in.
I just made a pot of tea.

1200
01:51:08,411 --> 01:51:10,705
Hagrid, are you okay?

1201
01:51:10,872 --> 01:51:13,750
I'm fine. I'm all right.

1202
01:51:14,709 --> 01:51:16,419
Did you hear about Hermione?

1203
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:20,632
Oh, yeah. I heard about that, all right.

1204
01:51:20,924 --> 01:51:24,636
Look, we have to ask you something.

1205
01:51:26,263 --> 01:51:29,766
Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?

1206
01:51:32,143 --> 01:51:34,020
What you had to understand
about that is--

1207
01:51:36,064 --> 01:51:37,691
Quick, under the cloak.

1208
01:51:38,358 --> 01:51:41,403
Don't say a word.
Be quiet, both of you.

1209
01:51:47,868 --> 01:51:50,912
- Professor Dumbledore, sir.
- Good evening, Hagrid.

1210
01:51:51,079 --> 01:51:53,540
I wonder, could we...?

1211
01:51:53,707 --> 01:51:56,209
Of course. Come in. Come in.

1212
01:51:56,376 --> 01:51:57,711
That's Dad's boss.

1213
01:51:57,878 --> 01:52:01,464
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.

1214
01:52:01,673 --> 01:52:06,052
Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.
Had to come.

1215
01:52:06,219 --> 01:52:09,431
Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things have gone far enough.

1216
01:52:09,598 --> 01:52:12,809
- The Ministry's got to act.
- But I never--

1217
01:52:13,059 --> 01:52:14,811
You know I never, professor.

1218
01:52:14,978 --> 01:52:18,064
I want it understood, Cornelius...

1219
01:52:18,231 --> 01:52:20,066
...that Hagrid...

1220
01:52:20,233 --> 01:52:22,569
...has my full confidence.

1221
01:52:22,736 --> 01:52:26,489
Albus, look,
Hagrid's record is against him.

1222
01:52:26,698 --> 01:52:29,242
- I've got to take him.
- Take me?

1223
01:52:29,409 --> 01:52:31,703
Take me where?
Not Azkaban prison.

1224
01:52:31,953 --> 01:52:35,749
I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.

1225
01:52:36,333 --> 01:52:38,251
Already here, Fudge?

1226
01:52:38,418 --> 01:52:39,753
Good.

1227
01:52:40,712 --> 01:52:43,423
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!

1228
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:45,634
Believe me...

1229
01:52:45,926 --> 01:52:50,138
...I take absolutely no pleasure
being inside your...

1230
01:52:52,015 --> 01:52:54,267
You call this a house?

1231
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:56,353
No.

1232
01:52:56,519 --> 01:53:00,440
I simply called up the school
and was told the headmaster was here.

1233
01:53:00,607 --> 01:53:04,653
Well, what exactly is it
that you want with me?

1234
01:53:05,236 --> 01:53:09,950
The other governors and I have decided
it's time for you to step aside.

1235
01:53:11,618 --> 01:53:14,496
This is an order of suspension.

1236
01:53:20,043 --> 01:53:23,463
You'll find all 12 signatures on it.

1237
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:31,513
I'm afraid we feel
you've rather lost your touch.

1238
01:53:32,263 --> 01:53:34,557
Well, what with all these attacks...

1239
01:53:34,766 --> 01:53:37,519
...there'll be no
Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.

1240
01:53:37,686 --> 01:53:42,232
I can only imagine what an awful loss
that would be to the school.

1241
01:53:42,399 --> 01:53:44,651
You can't take
Professor Dumbledore away.

1242
01:53:44,901 --> 01:53:47,487
Take him away and the Muggle-borns
won't stand a chance.

1243
01:53:47,654 --> 01:53:50,073
You mark my words,
there'll be killings next!

1244
01:53:50,281 --> 01:53:51,908
You think so?

1245
01:53:52,075 --> 01:53:54,577
Calm yourself, Hagrid.

1246
01:53:55,912 --> 01:53:58,665
If the governors desire my removal...

1247
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:02,544
...I will, of course, step aside.

1248
01:54:04,170 --> 01:54:06,381
However...

1249
01:54:07,048 --> 01:54:11,594
...you will find that help
will always be given at Hogwarts...

1250
01:54:11,803 --> 01:54:13,680
...to those who...

1251
01:54:13,847 --> 01:54:16,182
...ask for it.

1252
01:54:22,939 --> 01:54:25,275
Admirable sentiments.

1253
01:54:25,442 --> 01:54:27,318
Shall we?

1254
01:54:39,372 --> 01:54:40,915
Fudge.

1255
01:54:42,625 --> 01:54:44,461
Come, Hagrid.

1256
01:54:45,587 --> 01:54:47,130
Well?

1257
01:54:47,839 --> 01:54:48,882
if...

1258
01:54:49,340 --> 01:54:51,885
If anybody was looking for some stuff...

1259
01:54:52,052 --> 01:54:56,890
...then all they'd have to do
would be to follow the spiders.

1260
01:54:57,057 --> 01:54:59,642
Yep. That would lead them right.

1261
01:54:59,851 --> 01:55:01,770
That's all I have to say.

1262
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:07,233
Oh, and someone will need
to feed Fang while I'm away.

1263
01:55:10,612 --> 01:55:12,614
Good boy.

1264
01:55:18,745 --> 01:55:20,914
Hagrid's right.

1265
01:55:21,081 --> 01:55:24,000
With Dumbledore gone,
there'll be an attack a day.

1266
01:55:24,167 --> 01:55:25,877
Look.

1267
01:55:31,925 --> 01:55:33,676
Come on.

1268
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:39,432
Come on, Fang.

1269
01:55:57,700 --> 01:55:59,119
Come on.

1270
01:55:59,285 --> 01:56:00,537
What?

1271
01:56:00,703 --> 01:56:03,957
You heard what Hagrid said.
"Follow the spiders."

1272
01:56:04,165 --> 01:56:06,793
They're heading to the Dark Forest.

1273
01:56:08,837 --> 01:56:13,299
Why spiders? Why couldn't it be
"follow the butterflies"?

1274
01:56:46,958 --> 01:56:50,753
There's something
moving over there. Listen.

1275
01:56:51,838 --> 01:56:53,965
- It sounds like something big.
- Big?

1276
01:56:59,304 --> 01:57:02,599
Harry! Harry, it's our car!

1277
01:57:03,641 --> 01:57:07,854
It must've been here all the time.
And, look, the forest has turned it wild.

1278
01:57:10,648 --> 01:57:13,860
Come on.
We don't want to lose the trail.

1279
01:57:27,415 --> 01:57:30,210
Harry, I don't like this.

1280
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:38,551
- Harry, I don't like this at all.
- Shush!

1281
01:57:50,063 --> 01:57:52,565
Can we go back now?

1282
01:57:52,732 --> 01:57:54,484
Come on.

1283
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:46,953
Who is it?

1284
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:48,788
Don't panic.

1285
01:58:49,122 --> 01:58:50,623
Hagrid?

1286
01:58:50,999 --> 01:58:52,625
Is that you?

1287
01:58:53,167 --> 01:58:55,128
We're friends of Hagrid's.

1288
01:59:13,187 --> 01:59:16,441
And you?
You're Aragog, aren't you?

1289
01:59:17,025 --> 01:59:18,318
Yes.

1290
01:59:18,484 --> 01:59:22,322
Hagrid has never sent
men into our hollow before.

1291
01:59:22,488 --> 01:59:25,575
He's in trouble. Up at the school,
there have been attacks.

1292
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:28,036
They think it's Hagrid.

1293
01:59:28,202 --> 01:59:31,831
They think he opened
the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.

1294
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:34,375
That's a lie.

1295
01:59:34,834 --> 01:59:37,754
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1296
01:59:38,379 --> 01:59:41,257
- Then you're not the monster?
- No.

1297
01:59:41,466 --> 01:59:44,510
The monster was born in the castle.

1298
01:59:44,677 --> 01:59:50,016
I came to Hagrid from a distant land
in the pocket of a traveler.

1299
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:53,478
- Harry.
- Shush.

1300
01:59:54,187 --> 01:59:58,733
But if you're not the monster, then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago?

1301
01:59:58,900 --> 02:00:01,903
We do not speak of it.

1302
02:00:02,236 --> 02:00:07,784
It is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others.

1303
02:00:07,992 --> 02:00:09,744
But have you seen it?

1304
02:00:10,411 --> 02:00:16,250
I never saw any part of the
castle but the box in which I was kept.

1305
02:00:16,417 --> 02:00:19,587
The girl was discovered
in a bathroom.

1306
02:00:19,754 --> 02:00:24,258
When I was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.

1307
02:00:24,425 --> 02:00:26,427
- Harry!
- What?

1308
02:00:39,273 --> 02:00:42,276
Well, thank you.

1309
02:00:43,236 --> 02:00:45,405
We'll just go.

1310
02:00:45,905 --> 02:00:47,615
Go?

1311
02:00:47,824 --> 02:00:49,617
I think not.

1312
02:00:49,784 --> 02:00:55,248
My sons and daughters
do not harm Hagrid on my command.

1313
02:00:55,415 --> 02:00:57,834
But I cannot deny them
fresh meat...

1314
02:00:58,042 --> 02:01:02,338
...when it wanders
so willingly into our midst.

1315
02:01:02,547 --> 02:01:06,300
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.

1316
02:01:06,467 --> 02:01:08,302
Can we panic now?

1317
02:01:19,063 --> 02:01:20,940
Know any spells?

1318
02:01:21,107 --> 02:01:24,277
One, but it's not powerful
enough for all of them.

1319
02:01:24,444 --> 02:01:27,196
Where's Hermione when you need her?

1320
02:01:40,710 --> 02:01:42,003
Let's go!

1321
02:01:47,133 --> 02:01:49,218
<i>Arania Exumai!</i>

1322
02:01:54,515 --> 02:01:55,850
Go!

1323
02:02:06,819 --> 02:02:08,154
Whoa!

1324
02:02:13,826 --> 02:02:15,912
Glad we're out of there.

1325
02:02:22,877 --> 02:02:25,213
<i>Arania Exumai!</i>

1326
02:02:30,927 --> 02:02:34,680
- Thanks for that.
- Don't mention it.

1327
02:02:45,650 --> 02:02:47,777
Get us out of here.

1328
02:02:48,277 --> 02:02:49,946
Now!

1329
02:02:52,031 --> 02:02:56,285
Come on!
Come on, move faster!

1330
02:02:58,955 --> 02:03:00,289
Come on! Go!

1331
02:03:17,807 --> 02:03:19,892
Get us in the air.

1332
02:03:20,935 --> 02:03:22,395
The flying gear's jammed!

1333
02:03:26,482 --> 02:03:30,278
- Come on! Pull!
- I'm trying!

1334
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:02,518
Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.

1335
02:04:02,727 --> 02:04:07,023
If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,
I'll kill him.

1336
02:04:21,037 --> 02:04:24,290
I mean, what was the point
of sending us in there?

1337
02:04:24,457 --> 02:04:29,045
- What have we found out?
- We know one thing.

1338
02:04:29,253 --> 02:04:32,632
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1339
02:04:32,798 --> 02:04:34,800
He was innocent.

1340
02:04:50,316 --> 02:04:52,777
Wish you were here, Hermione.

1341
02:04:53,319 --> 02:04:55,571
We need you.

1342
02:04:56,489 --> 02:04:58,574
Now more than ever.

1343
02:05:15,508 --> 02:05:18,928
- What's that?
- Ron...

1344
02:05:19,804 --> 02:05:24,225
This is why Hermione was in
the library the day she was attacked.

1345
02:05:24,809 --> 02:05:26,018
Come on.

1346
02:05:26,686 --> 02:05:29,689
"Of the many fearsome beasts
that roam our land...

1347
02:05:29,855 --> 02:05:34,443
...none is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years...

1348
02:05:34,610 --> 02:05:38,406
...instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye.

1349
02:05:38,572 --> 02:05:41,575
Spiders flee before it."
Ron, this is it.

1350
02:05:41,742 --> 02:05:44,537
The monster in the
Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.

1351
02:05:44,704 --> 02:05:48,624
That's why I can hear it speak.
It's a snake.

1352
02:05:48,958 --> 02:05:54,255
But if it kills by looking people
in the eye, why is it no one's dead?

1353
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:07,852
Because no one did look it
in the eye.

1354
02:06:09,770 --> 02:06:12,398
Not directly, at least.

1355
02:06:13,607 --> 02:06:15,818
Colin saw it through his camera.

1356
02:06:15,985 --> 02:06:20,072
Justin-- Justin must have seen the
basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.

1357
02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:24,243
Nick got the full blast of it.
But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.

1358
02:06:24,410 --> 02:06:27,496
And Hermione had the mirror.

1359
02:06:27,663 --> 02:06:31,083
I bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along.

1360
02:06:31,250 --> 02:06:32,501
And Mrs. Norris?

1361
02:06:32,668 --> 02:06:36,172
I'm pretty sure she didn't have
a camera or a mirror, Harry.

1362
02:06:37,757 --> 02:06:39,592
The water.

1363
02:06:40,092 --> 02:06:45,639
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.

1364
02:06:51,771 --> 02:06:53,689
"Spiders flee before it."

1365
02:06:53,898 --> 02:06:57,610
- It all fits.
- How's the basilisk been getting around?

1366
02:06:57,777 --> 02:07:00,613
A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.

1367
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:06,452
- Hermione's answered that too.
- Pipes? It's using the plumbing.

1368
02:07:06,619 --> 02:07:10,873
Remember what Aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago?

1369
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:15,294
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?

1370
02:07:15,961 --> 02:07:17,296
Moaning Myrtle.

1371
02:07:18,297 --> 02:07:22,301
<i>All students are to
return to their dormitories at once.</i>

1372
02:07:22,468 --> 02:07:25,930
<i>All teachers to the second-floor
corridor immediately.</i>

1373
02:07:30,935 --> 02:07:36,732
As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin
has left another message.

1374
02:07:36,941 --> 02:07:39,151
Our worst fear has been realized.

1375
02:07:39,318 --> 02:07:43,864
A student has been taken by the monster
into the Chamber itself.

1376
02:07:44,949 --> 02:07:50,579
The students must be sent home.
I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

1377
02:07:52,998 --> 02:07:55,417
So sorry. Dozed off.
What have I missed?

1378
02:07:55,584 --> 02:07:59,922
A girl has been snatched by the monster,
Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

1379
02:08:00,089 --> 02:08:03,050
- My moment?
- Weren't you saying just last night...

1380
02:08:03,217 --> 02:08:07,763
...that you've known all along where the
entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?

1381
02:08:09,098 --> 02:08:14,603
That's settled. We'll leave you
to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.

1382
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:19,942
- Your skills, after all, are legend.
- Very well.

1383
02:08:20,109 --> 02:08:23,362
I'll just be in my office getting...

1384
02:08:24,196 --> 02:08:26,115
Getting ready.

1385
02:08:29,034 --> 02:08:32,246
Who is it that the monster's taken,
Minerva?

1386
02:08:32,413 --> 02:08:34,248
Ginny Weasley.

1387
02:08:45,634 --> 02:08:48,721
"Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever."

1388
02:08:52,766 --> 02:08:54,560
Ginny.

1389
02:08:56,645 --> 02:09:00,149
Lockhart's useless, but he's
going to try and get into the Chamber.

1390
02:09:00,316 --> 02:09:03,068
At least we can tell him
what we know.

1391
02:09:04,403 --> 02:09:06,947
Professor, we have some information
for you.

1392
02:09:08,741 --> 02:09:10,659
Are you going somewhere?

1393
02:09:10,826 --> 02:09:13,954
Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
Got to go.

1394
02:09:14,121 --> 02:09:17,333
- What about my sister?
- Well...

1395
02:09:17,666 --> 02:09:21,170
As to that, most unfortunate.
No one regrets more than I.

1396
02:09:21,337 --> 02:09:25,341
You're the Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher. You can't go now.

1397
02:09:25,549 --> 02:09:28,510
I must say, when I took the job,
there was nothing in the description--

1398
02:09:28,677 --> 02:09:29,845
You're running away?

1399
02:09:30,054 --> 02:09:32,806
- After all you did in your books?
- Books can be misleading.

1400
02:09:32,973 --> 02:09:35,517
- You wrote them.
- My dear boy, use your common sense.

1401
02:09:35,684 --> 02:09:40,105
My books wouldn't have sold as well if
people didn't think I'd done those things.

1402
02:09:40,689 --> 02:09:42,274
You're a fraud.

1403
02:09:42,441 --> 02:09:45,277
You've been taking credit
for what other wizards have done.

1404
02:09:45,444 --> 02:09:47,363
Is there anything you can do?

1405
02:09:47,571 --> 02:09:52,284
Yes, now you mention it.
I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.

1406
02:09:52,451 --> 02:09:54,954
Otherwise, all those wizards
would have gone blabbing.

1407
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:58,207
I'd never have sold another book.

1408
02:09:58,374 --> 02:10:04,129
In fact, I'm going to have to do
the same to you.

1409
02:10:04,630 --> 02:10:07,383
Don't even think about it.

1410
02:10:18,227 --> 02:10:19,687
Who's there?

1411
02:10:22,147 --> 02:10:24,149
Hello, Harry.

1412
02:10:25,109 --> 02:10:30,239
- What do you want?
- To ask you how you died.

1413
02:10:32,658 --> 02:10:35,077
It was dreadful.

1414
02:10:35,244 --> 02:10:38,914
It happened right here
in this very cubicle.

1415
02:10:39,123 --> 02:10:43,168
I'd hidden because Olive Hornby
was teasing me about my glasses.

1416
02:10:43,335 --> 02:10:48,215
I was crying, and then
I heard somebody come in.

1417
02:10:48,382 --> 02:10:54,722
- Who was it, Myrtle?
- I don't know. I was distraught!

1418
02:10:56,015 --> 02:10:59,435
But they said something funny,
a kind of made-up language.

1419
02:10:59,643 --> 02:11:05,941
And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and...

1420
02:11:07,151 --> 02:11:11,947
- ...I died.
- Just like that? How?

1421
02:11:12,156 --> 02:11:16,618
I just remember seeing a pair
of great, big, yellow eyes...

1422
02:11:16,785 --> 02:11:20,664
...over there by that sink.

1423
02:11:45,731 --> 02:11:47,775
This is it.

1424
02:11:48,692 --> 02:11:53,489
This is it, Ron. I think this is
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.

1425
02:11:55,491 --> 02:12:00,329
Say something. Harry,
say something in Parseltongue.

1426
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:55,968
Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Well, then, I'll just be...

1427
02:12:56,135 --> 02:12:58,387
There's no need for me to stay.

1428
02:12:59,012 --> 02:13:00,889
Yes, there is.

1429
02:13:02,766 --> 02:13:05,811
- You first.
- Now, boys, what good will it do?

1430
02:13:05,978 --> 02:13:07,312
Better you than us.

1431
02:13:08,522 --> 02:13:11,483
But-- Obviously, yes.

1432
02:13:15,779 --> 02:13:18,490
Sure you don't want to test it first?

1433
02:13:25,289 --> 02:13:28,500
It's really quite filthy down here.

1434
02:13:29,001 --> 02:13:33,505
- All right. Let's go.
- Oh, Harry?

1435
02:13:33,922 --> 02:13:38,844
If you die down there,
you're welcome to share my toilet.

1436
02:13:41,388 --> 02:13:43,348
Thanks, Myrtle.

1437
02:14:08,540 --> 02:14:10,375
Ugh.

1438
02:14:12,461 --> 02:14:17,633
Now, remember: Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straightaway.

1439
02:14:18,592 --> 02:14:20,260
Go on.

1440
02:14:23,972 --> 02:14:25,349
This way.

1441
02:14:32,356 --> 02:14:37,569
- What's this?
- It looks like a snake.

1442
02:14:37,736 --> 02:14:41,406
- It's a snakeskin.
- Bloody hell.

1443
02:14:41,573 --> 02:14:47,412
Whatever shed this must be
60 feet long. Or more.

1444
02:14:49,289 --> 02:14:52,251
Heart of a lion, this one.

1445
02:14:55,963 --> 02:15:00,634
The adventure ends here, boys.
But don't fret.

1446
02:15:02,594 --> 02:15:08,016
The world will know our story.
How I was too late to save the girl.

1447
02:15:08,392 --> 02:15:11,853
How you two
tragically lost your minds...

1448
02:15:12,020 --> 02:15:15,023
...at the sight of her mangled body.

1449
02:15:15,899 --> 02:15:17,317
So...

1450
02:15:18,443 --> 02:15:20,779
You first, Mr. Potter.

1451
02:15:21,029 --> 02:15:24,199
Say goodbye to your memories.

1452
02:15:26,285 --> 02:15:28,203
<i>Obliviate!</i>

1453
02:15:54,938 --> 02:15:57,065
Harry.

1454
02:15:57,816 --> 02:15:59,943
Harry.

1455
02:16:02,154 --> 02:16:05,240
- Ron! Ron, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1456
02:16:08,994 --> 02:16:10,746
Hello.

1457
02:16:11,455 --> 02:16:13,248
Who are you?

1458
02:16:14,666 --> 02:16:17,336
- Ron Weasley.
- Really?

1459
02:16:17,502 --> 02:16:20,339
And who am I?

1460
02:16:22,090 --> 02:16:26,470
Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is.

1461
02:16:26,762 --> 02:16:31,266
It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?

1462
02:16:31,475 --> 02:16:33,560
Do you live here?

1463
02:16:34,269 --> 02:16:36,772
- No.
- Really?

1464
02:16:41,360 --> 02:16:43,195
- What do I do now?
- You wait here...

1465
02:16:43,362 --> 02:16:46,281
...and try and shift some of this rock
so we can get back through.

1466
02:16:46,490 --> 02:16:50,118
- I'll go on and find Ginny.
- Okay.

1467
02:18:13,952 --> 02:18:15,787
Ginny.

1468
02:18:23,336 --> 02:18:27,215
Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead.
Wake up, wake up.

1469
02:18:27,716 --> 02:18:29,801
Please wake up.

1470
02:18:30,093 --> 02:18:32,220
She won't wake.

1471
02:18:37,684 --> 02:18:42,022
Tom. Tom Riddle.
What do you mean, she won't wake?

1472
02:18:42,189 --> 02:18:45,609
- She's not...?
- She's still alive, but only just.

1473
02:18:46,610 --> 02:18:48,862
- Are you a ghost?
- A memory...

1474
02:18:49,029 --> 02:18:51,406
...preserved in a diary for 50 years.

1475
02:18:54,117 --> 02:18:59,331
She's cold as ice.
Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.

1476
02:18:59,498 --> 02:19:01,875
You've got to help me, Tom.
There's a basilisk.

1477
02:19:02,042 --> 02:19:04,669
It won't come until it's called.

1478
02:19:07,422 --> 02:19:10,258
- Give me my wand, Tom.
- You won't be needing it.

1479
02:19:11,343 --> 02:19:14,721
- We've got to go. We've got to save her.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

1480
02:19:14,888 --> 02:19:18,934
You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker,
I grow stronger.

1481
02:19:20,268 --> 02:19:24,773
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

1482
02:19:24,940 --> 02:19:27,275
No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.

1483
02:19:27,442 --> 02:19:30,695
Ginny set the basilisk
on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...

1484
02:19:30,862 --> 02:19:33,281
...Ginny wrote the threatening
messages on the walls.

1485
02:19:33,448 --> 02:19:36,743
- But why?
- Because I told her to.

1486
02:19:36,910 --> 02:19:41,873
You'll find I can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing.

1487
02:19:42,040 --> 02:19:45,377
She was, shall we say,
in a kind of trance.

1488
02:19:45,919 --> 02:19:48,421
Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her.

1489
02:19:48,588 --> 02:19:50,966
She tried to dispose of it
in the girls' bathroom.

1490
02:19:51,174 --> 02:19:55,470
And then who should find it but you?

1491
02:19:55,679 --> 02:19:58,765
The very person
I was most anxious to meet.

1492
02:19:59,391 --> 02:20:01,434
And why did you want to meet me?

1493
02:20:01,810 --> 02:20:05,230
I knew I had to talk to you,
meet you if I could.

1494
02:20:05,397 --> 02:20:08,650
So I decided to show you my capture
of that brainless oaf Hagrid...

1495
02:20:08,817 --> 02:20:11,987
- ...to gain your trust.
- Hagrid's my friend.

1496
02:20:12,904 --> 02:20:17,492
- And you framed him, didn't you?
- It was my word against Hagrid's.

1497
02:20:17,701 --> 02:20:20,954
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent.

1498
02:20:21,121 --> 02:20:23,290
I'll bet Dumbledore saw
right through you.

1499
02:20:23,456 --> 02:20:26,918
He certainly kept an annoyingly close
watch on me after that.

1500
02:20:27,085 --> 02:20:30,422
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the
Chamber again while I was at school...

1501
02:20:30,589 --> 02:20:32,424
...so I decided to leave behind
a diary...

1502
02:20:32,591 --> 02:20:34,676
...preserving my 16-year-old self
in its pages...

1503
02:20:34,843 --> 02:20:37,512
...so that one day
I would be able to lead another...

1504
02:20:37,721 --> 02:20:40,515
...to finish Salazar Slytherin's
noble work.

1505
02:20:40,724 --> 02:20:42,934
Well, you haven't finished it
this time.

1506
02:20:43,101 --> 02:20:46,104
In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught
will be ready.

1507
02:20:46,271 --> 02:20:48,982
And everyone who was Petrified
will be all right again.

1508
02:20:49,357 --> 02:20:54,613
Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods
doesn't matter to me anymore.

1509
02:20:54,863 --> 02:20:59,659
For many months now,
my new target has been you.

1510
02:21:01,119 --> 02:21:04,748
How is it that a baby
with no extraordinary magical talent...

1511
02:21:04,914 --> 02:21:07,542
...was able to defeat the greatest wizard
of all time?

1512
02:21:07,876 --> 02:21:10,837
How did you escape with nothing
but a scar...

1513
02:21:11,004 --> 02:21:13,381
...while Lord Voldemort's powers
were destroyed?

1514
02:21:13,548 --> 02:21:17,761
Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

1515
02:21:17,927 --> 02:21:24,392
Voldemort is my past,
present and future.

1516
02:21:44,829 --> 02:21:48,291
You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.

1517
02:21:51,419 --> 02:21:55,006
- You're Voldemort.
- Surely you didn't think...

1518
02:21:55,173 --> 02:21:59,678
...I was going to keep
my filthy Muggle father's name?

1519
02:21:59,844 --> 02:22:04,015
No. I fashioned myself a new name,
a name I knew wizards everywhere...

1520
02:22:04,182 --> 02:22:08,395
...would fear to speak when I became
the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1521
02:22:08,561 --> 02:22:11,731
Albus Dumbledore
is the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1522
02:22:11,898 --> 02:22:15,318
Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of me.

1523
02:22:15,527 --> 02:22:20,532
He'll never be gone. Not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him.

1524
02:22:26,913 --> 02:22:27,956
Fawkes?

1525
02:22:44,222 --> 02:22:47,809
So this is what Dumbledore
sends his great defender.

1526
02:22:47,976 --> 02:22:51,646
A songbird and an old hat.

1527
02:23:04,951 --> 02:23:09,497
Let's match the power of Lord
Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin...

1528
02:23:09,664 --> 02:23:13,668
...against the famous Harry Potter.

1529
02:23:27,015 --> 02:23:31,394
Parseltongue won't save you now,
Potter. It only obeys me.

1530
02:24:01,549 --> 02:24:03,134
No!

1531
02:24:03,551 --> 02:24:08,056
Your bird may have blinded the basilisk,
but it can still hear you.

1532
02:25:50,074 --> 02:25:53,328
Yes, Potter.
The process is nearly complete.

1533
02:25:53,536 --> 02:25:58,416
In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead, and I will cease to be a memory.

1534
02:25:58,583 --> 02:26:01,252
Lord Voldemort will return...

1535
02:26:01,628 --> 02:26:05,840
...very much alive.

1536
02:26:06,591 --> 02:26:07,967
Ginny?

1537
02:28:24,312 --> 02:28:25,897
Remarkable, isn't it...

1538
02:28:26,064 --> 02:28:30,068
...how quickly the venom
of the basilisk penetrates the body?

1539
02:28:30,234 --> 02:28:32,904
I'd guess you have little more
than a minute to live.

1540
02:28:33,237 --> 02:28:37,283
You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.

1541
02:28:42,288 --> 02:28:45,958
Funny, the damage a silly
little book can do...

1542
02:28:46,125 --> 02:28:51,214
...especially in the hands
of a silly little girl.

1543
02:28:54,008 --> 02:28:55,843
What are you doing?

1544
02:28:58,721 --> 02:29:00,807
Stop. No!

1545
02:29:53,484 --> 02:29:55,403
Ginny.

1546
02:29:57,155 --> 02:29:58,906
Harry.

1547
02:29:59,073 --> 02:30:03,077
It was me.
But I swear, I didn't mean to.

1548
02:30:03,286 --> 02:30:06,789
Riddle made me, and...

1549
02:30:07,290 --> 02:30:09,917
Harry, you're hurt.

1550
02:30:10,293 --> 02:30:11,752
Don't worry.

1551
02:30:11,919 --> 02:30:15,590
Ginny, you need
to get yourself out.

1552
02:30:15,798 --> 02:30:19,010
Follow the Chamber
and you'll find Ron.

1553
02:30:31,189 --> 02:30:33,316
You were brilliant, Fawkes.

1554
02:30:34,400 --> 02:30:36,861
I just wasn't quick enough.

1555
02:30:57,632 --> 02:30:59,383
Of course.

1556
02:30:59,634 --> 02:31:02,470
Phoenix tears have healing powers.

1557
02:31:04,096 --> 02:31:05,890
Thanks.

1558
02:31:07,642 --> 02:31:09,769
It's all right, Ginny.

1559
02:31:10,895 --> 02:31:13,105
It's over.

1560
02:31:14,106 --> 02:31:16,651
It's just a memory.

1561
02:31:19,570 --> 02:31:24,909
Amazing!
This is just like magic!

1562
02:31:36,170 --> 02:31:38,839
You both realize, of course...

1563
02:31:39,006 --> 02:31:44,512
...that in the past few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules.

1564
02:31:45,137 --> 02:31:46,180
Yes, sir.

1565
02:31:46,389 --> 02:31:49,600
There is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled.

1566
02:31:49,767 --> 02:31:50,935
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1567
02:31:51,102 --> 02:31:53,896
Therefore, it is only fitting...

1568
02:31:55,439 --> 02:31:57,692
...that you both receive...

1569
02:31:58,192 --> 02:32:02,280
...Special Awards for Services
to the School.

1570
02:32:04,407 --> 02:32:06,200
Thanks, sir.

1571
02:32:06,784 --> 02:32:09,120
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would...

1572
02:32:09,287 --> 02:32:13,457
...have an owl deliver these
release papers to Azkaban.

1573
02:32:14,542 --> 02:32:19,297
I believe we want
our gamekeeper back.

1574
02:32:22,008 --> 02:32:23,968
Harry.

1575
02:32:24,302 --> 02:32:28,639
First, I want to thank you, Harry.

1576
02:32:29,223 --> 02:32:32,727
You must have shown me
real loyalty down in the Chamber.

1577
02:32:33,644 --> 02:32:38,190
Nothing but that
could have called Fawkes to you.

1578
02:32:40,568 --> 02:32:42,153
And...

1579
02:32:42,695 --> 02:32:44,155
...second...

1580
02:32:44,322 --> 02:32:49,076
...I sense that something
is troubling you.

1581
02:32:49,327 --> 02:32:51,829
Am I right, Harry?

1582
02:32:53,664 --> 02:32:55,374
It's just...

1583
02:32:56,542 --> 02:33:01,255
You see, sir, I couldn't help
but notice certain things, certain...

1584
02:33:01,464 --> 02:33:07,094
Certain similarities
between Tom Riddle and me.

1585
02:33:07,678 --> 02:33:08,846
I see.

1586
02:33:09,013 --> 02:33:14,852
Well, you can speak
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?

1587
02:33:15,269 --> 02:33:20,775
Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.

1588
02:33:22,026 --> 02:33:24,737
If I'm not mistaken, Harry...

1589
02:33:25,112 --> 02:33:28,949
...he transferred
some of his powers to you...

1590
02:33:29,116 --> 02:33:32,078
...the night he gave you that scar.

1591
02:33:32,244 --> 02:33:36,123
Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?

1592
02:33:36,374 --> 02:33:37,875
Uh-huh.

1593
02:33:38,042 --> 02:33:40,753
Not intentionally...

1594
02:33:41,629 --> 02:33:43,547
...but yes.

1595
02:33:45,508 --> 02:33:48,803
So the Sorting Hat was right.
I should be in Slytherin.

1596
02:33:49,011 --> 02:33:53,808
It's true. You possess many of the
qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.

1597
02:33:54,016 --> 02:33:56,811
Determination, resourcefulness...

1598
02:33:57,019 --> 02:34:01,023
...and if I may say so,
a certain disregard for the rules.

1599
02:34:01,732 --> 02:34:05,736
Why, then, did the Sorting Hat
place you in Gryffindor?

1600
02:34:06,570 --> 02:34:10,241
- Because I asked it to.
- Exactly, Harry. Exactly.

1601
02:34:10,408 --> 02:34:12,451
Which makes you different
from Voldemort.

1602
02:34:12,618 --> 02:34:16,539
It is not our abilities
that show what we truly are.

1603
02:34:16,789 --> 02:34:18,916
It is our choices.

1604
02:34:22,586 --> 02:34:26,006
If you want proof
why you belong in Gryffindor...

1605
02:34:26,173 --> 02:34:31,095
...then I suggest
you look more closely at this.

1606
02:34:32,096 --> 02:34:33,764
Be careful.

1607
02:34:39,437 --> 02:34:42,106
Godric Gryffindor.

1608
02:34:42,273 --> 02:34:46,318
It would take a true Gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat.

1609
02:34:55,202 --> 02:34:56,620
Dobby.

1610
02:34:57,872 --> 02:35:02,293
So this is your master.
The family you serve is the Malfoys.

1611
02:35:04,462 --> 02:35:07,798
I'll deal with you later.

1612
02:35:13,637 --> 02:35:15,222
Out of my way, Potter.

1613
02:35:15,389 --> 02:35:18,976
So it's true. You have returned.

1614
02:35:19,643 --> 02:35:22,480
When the governors learned that
Arthur Weasley's daughter...

1615
02:35:22,646 --> 02:35:26,817
...was taken into the Chamber,
they saw fit to summon me back.

1616
02:35:27,651 --> 02:35:28,986
Ridiculous.

1617
02:35:29,153 --> 02:35:31,655
Curiously, Lucius, several of them...

1618
02:35:31,864 --> 02:35:35,534
...were under the impression
that you would curse their families...

1619
02:35:35,701 --> 02:35:38,537
...if they did not agree
to suspend me in the first place.

1620
02:35:38,996 --> 02:35:42,500
- How dare you!
- Beg your pardon?

1621
02:35:42,666 --> 02:35:46,420
My sole concern has always been
and will always be...

1622
02:35:46,629 --> 02:35:49,423
...the welfare of this school...

1623
02:35:49,632 --> 02:35:53,886
...and, of course, its students.

1624
02:35:57,932 --> 02:36:02,186
The culprit has been identified,
I presume?

1625
02:36:02,520 --> 02:36:04,063
Oh, yes.

1626
02:36:05,689 --> 02:36:07,525
And?

1627
02:36:08,692 --> 02:36:10,694
Who was it?

1628
02:36:17,159 --> 02:36:20,538
- Voldemort.
- Ah.

1629
02:36:20,871 --> 02:36:26,293
Only this time he chose to act
through somebody else...

1630
02:36:26,877 --> 02:36:30,464
...by means of this.

1631
02:36:33,175 --> 02:36:34,718
I see.

1632
02:36:36,178 --> 02:36:40,391
Fortunately,
our young Mr. Potter discovered it.

1633
02:36:40,724 --> 02:36:44,395
One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old school-things...

1634
02:36:44,562 --> 02:36:47,773
...should find their way
into innocent hands.

1635
02:36:48,107 --> 02:36:52,069
The consequences for the one
responsible would be...

1636
02:36:52,403 --> 02:36:54,280
...severe.

1637
02:36:55,739 --> 02:36:58,492
Well, let us hope...

1638
02:36:58,701 --> 02:37:04,248
...that Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.

1639
02:37:04,957 --> 02:37:08,752
Don't worry. I will be.

1640
02:37:17,469 --> 02:37:19,513
Dumbledore.

1641
02:37:20,639 --> 02:37:24,226
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.

1642
02:37:41,452 --> 02:37:45,956
Sir?
I wonder if I could have that?

1643
02:37:52,338 --> 02:37:53,964
Mr. Malfoy.

1644
02:37:54,131 --> 02:37:56,300
Mr. Malfoy!

1645
02:37:56,800 --> 02:37:58,969
I have something of yours.

1646
02:38:00,638 --> 02:38:03,557
Mine? I don't know
what you're talking about.

1647
02:38:03,766 --> 02:38:05,309
Oh, I think you do, sir.

1648
02:38:05,476 --> 02:38:08,562
I think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...

1649
02:38:08,771 --> 02:38:10,147
...that day at Diagon Alley.

1650
02:38:10,856 --> 02:38:13,400
You do, do you?

1651
02:38:20,783 --> 02:38:23,827
Why don't you prove it?

1652
02:38:30,084 --> 02:38:32,294
Come, Dobby.

1653
02:38:33,545 --> 02:38:35,589
Open it.

1654
02:38:39,093 --> 02:38:40,678
Dobby.

1655
02:38:40,844 --> 02:38:44,014
Master has given Dobby a sock.

1656
02:38:44,306 --> 02:38:46,350
What? I didn't give--

1657
02:38:46,517 --> 02:38:50,229
Master has presented Dobby
with clothes.

1658
02:38:50,396 --> 02:38:53,440
Dobby is free.

1659
02:39:00,030 --> 02:39:03,742
You lost me my servant!

1660
02:39:10,708 --> 02:39:14,712
You shall not harm Harry Potter.

1661
02:39:23,762 --> 02:39:24,847
Hm.

1662
02:39:26,890 --> 02:39:30,561
Your parents were
meddlesome fools too.

1663
02:39:30,728 --> 02:39:33,897
Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon...

1664
02:39:34,064 --> 02:39:39,278
...you are going to meet
the same sticky end.

1665
02:39:44,992 --> 02:39:50,914
Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?

1666
02:39:51,248 --> 02:39:55,502
- Just promise me something.
- Anything, sir.

1667
02:39:57,463 --> 02:39:59,923
Never try to save my life again.

1668
02:40:06,096 --> 02:40:09,099
- Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1669
02:40:09,391 --> 02:40:11,769
- Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
- Good evening.

1670
02:40:11,935 --> 02:40:14,813
- Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1671
02:40:16,190 --> 02:40:18,442
Hello.

1672
02:40:20,110 --> 02:40:24,782
- Hermione! Welcome back.
- Thanks, Sir Nicholas.

1673
02:40:27,993 --> 02:40:31,330
Harry. It's Hermione.

1674
02:40:52,684 --> 02:40:57,314
Uh, um, ahem.

1675
02:40:58,148 --> 02:41:01,860
- Welcome back, Hermione.
- It's good to be back.

1676
02:41:02,027 --> 02:41:04,655
Congratulations.
I can't believe you solved it.

1677
02:41:04,822 --> 02:41:07,032
We had loads of help from you.

1678
02:41:07,199 --> 02:41:10,410
- We couldn't have done it without you.
- Thanks.

1679
02:41:12,246 --> 02:41:15,207
Could I have your attention, please?

1680
02:41:19,378 --> 02:41:21,880
Before we begin the feast...

1681
02:41:22,047 --> 02:41:28,345
...let us have a round of applause
for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...

1682
02:41:28,512 --> 02:41:32,599
...whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered...

1683
02:41:32,766 --> 02:41:35,477
...to all who had been Petrified.

1684
02:41:45,988 --> 02:41:48,949
Also, in light of the recent events...

1685
02:41:49,116 --> 02:41:51,285
...as a school treat...

1686
02:41:51,493 --> 02:41:55,414
...all exams have been canceled.

1687
02:41:58,083 --> 02:41:59,710
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1688
02:42:16,602 --> 02:42:18,645
Sorry I'm late.

1689
02:42:24,735 --> 02:42:29,114
The owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused.

1690
02:42:29,448 --> 02:42:32,743
Some ruddy bird called Errol.

1691
02:42:48,550 --> 02:42:54,556
And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't
been for you, Harry, and Ron...

1692
02:42:54,765 --> 02:42:57,684
...and Hermione, of course...

1693
02:42:58,352 --> 02:43:02,439
...I would still be you-know-where...

1694
02:43:02,606 --> 02:43:06,193
...so I'd just like to say thanks.

1695
02:43:15,619 --> 02:43:18,580
There's no Hogwarts
without you, Hagrid.
