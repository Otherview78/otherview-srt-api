1
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:34,460
Check.

2
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,362
Checkmate.

3
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,780
Your father
wants to see you.

4
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,147
Come.

5
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,092
Lisbeth made it for me.

6
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,064
You're such big girls now.

7
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,980
Come, Camilla.
I want to play a game with you.

8
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,705
Camilla!

9
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,708
Come to your father.

10
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,677
Both of you.

11
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,585
Come.

12
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,936
Sorry about
the things I said.

13
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:40,172
It's all right.

14
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:50,182
You know I've been
under a lot of pressure,

15
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,517
with the trial and work.

16
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,953
Yes, I know.

17
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:58,690
Just forgive me.

18
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,396
I get a little insecure
sometimes

19
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,698
when you talk to me
like that.

20
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,310
Come here, have a drink.

21
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,014
You know how much I love you,
do you?

22
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,442
Who the fuck are you?

23
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,626
I'm a fan of yours.

24
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:10,395
I watch you on the news.

25
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:11,830
Peter ahlgren:

26
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,900
The ceo who beat up
two prostitutes

27
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:18,236
but got acquitted
in court yesterday.

28
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,873
Put me down!

29
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,710
Hey, what are you doing?

30
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,946
I'm accessing
your bank accounts.

31
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,414
Call security!

32
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,384
I'm transferring 20%
of your cash

33
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:33,485
to these two girls.

34
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:36,621
The rest, I'm transferring
to your wife.

35
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,257
<i> Good evening. Security.</i>

36
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,959
Account number.

37
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:41,726
Don't.

38
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:44,496
<i> Mrs. Ahlgren,</i>
<i> is everything okay?</i>

39
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,634
51912.

40
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:53,538
Take your child and leave.
He won't hurt you again.

41
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,243
I can undo all this tomorrow.

42
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:02,848
Mr. Chen has bankrolled
your company for years.

43
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,050
Isn't this his wife?

44
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,654
<i> Oh, my god,</i>
<i> you like that.</i>

45
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,864
If you try to contact
your wife again,

46
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:20,465
this video
will be sent to him.

47
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:23,168
If anything unexpected
should happen to her,

48
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,571
this video
will be sent to him.

49
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,073
You fucking bitch!

50
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,749
Who are you?!

51
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,887
You should ask yourself
that question.

52
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,134
<i> A string of vigilante attacks</i>
<i> has rocked Stockholm.</i>

53
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,436
<i>- I don't know her name.</i>
<i>- I've never seen her before.</i>

54
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:01,306
<i> The attacker's m.O. Matches</i>
<i> that of lisbeth salander,</i>

55
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:03,208
<i> a local hacker with a history</i>
<i> of aggravated assault.</i>

56
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,844
<i> If my daughter and I had</i>
<i> a message for her...</i>

57
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:10,982
<i> I just want to say,</i>
<i> whoever you are, thank you.</i>

58
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,462
This is a new era
for<i> millennium.</i>

59
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,731
I want you all to realize
that the only thing

60
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:35,667
holding this magazine back
is your mind.
Shit.

61
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:38,770
And people refuse to believe
that it's in your mind.

62
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:41,406
And you can feel it
when you go into a room,

63
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:46,011
and there are people there
who don't have this knowledge.

64
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,746
Don't be a child.

65
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:50,115
'Cause I don't wanna bend
the knee, kiss the ring?

66
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,684
Is that too much for "the great
mikael blomkvist"?

67
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,219
For what's left of him, yeah.

68
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:56,021
Levin is head
of publications now,

69
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:57,255
and he deserves
your respect.

70
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,958
He bought my magazine,
not my respect.

71
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,394
Plus, he's wearing a cap.

72
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:03,595
And...

73
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:06,398
He has over two million
followers online.

74
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,266
How many do you have?

75
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,369
What do you want from me?

76
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,339
I want you to write again.

77
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:23,848
Come by tonight.

78
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:29,187
I'm having dinner
with my husband tonight.

79
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,455
Erika.

80
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:32,057
It's for you.

81
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,426
She'll be
right with you.

82
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:56,347
Lisbeth salander has a pet.

83
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,086
It's a lizard.

84
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:05,256
I don't know if I'm happy
for you or sad for him.

85
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,767
Are you throwing
all of this out?

86
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,271
Yeah. It's trash.

87
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,175
You have a sister.

88
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,748
No.

89
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,887
She killed herself
three years ago.

90
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,125
I can't believe
you didn't tell me.

91
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:43,862
That I had a sister
or that she killed herself?

92
00:12:43,864 --> 00:12:44,496
Both.

93
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:49,300
When our loved ones die,
we tell our friends.

94
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:54,172
There's an incorrect assumption
in that statement.

95
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:57,642
Yo.

96
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:01,813
<i> There is a client asking</i>
<i> for the impossible.</i>

97
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:03,815
<i> Interested?</i>

98
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,583
Text me.

99
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,291
She worked for my father
for years.

100
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,495
He was a psychopath.

101
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,965
Turns out...

102
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,334
She was the same.

103
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,840
I'm glad they're both dead.

104
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,749
You have to go now.
I need to work.

105
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:41,619
If you have another girl coming,
you can tell me.

106
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,555
I have to work.

107
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,203
They say time is the fire
in which we burn.

108
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,205
I'm running out of it.

109
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,543
Yeah.

110
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,979
So do you think
it can be done?

111
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,882
- It depends.
- What am I looking for?

112
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,884
The sum of all my sins.

113
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:48,519
A 2725 byte piece of software.

114
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:51,890
It's a single-incident file.
It can't be reproduced,

115
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:54,559
copied, only moved.

116
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,195
And you want me
to steal it for you.

117
00:14:57,197 --> 00:15:01,299
They told me I'd have control
over it. But they lied.

118
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,035
I realized too late

119
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:07,305
that I had created
an abomination.

120
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:10,041
Please, help me.

121
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,587
Drop-off?

122
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,355
Tomorrow morning, 7:00 sharp.

123
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,391
Meet me on the centralbron,
south shore.

124
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,559
<i> I'll be next to</i>
<i> the train station.</i>

125
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,528
<i> I've provided two levels</i>
<i> of clearance.</i>

126
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,298
<i> After that,</i>
<i> you're on your own.</i>

127
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,597
<i> Take military systems,</i>
<i> for example.</i>

128
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:09,300
<i> Since 9/11,</i>
<i> all global defense systems</i>

129
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,436
<i> are controlled</i>
<i> by satellite networks,</i>

130
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,738
<i> and such networks</i>
<i> are all protected</i>

131
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,474
<i> by the same</i>
<i> quantum encryption protocol.</i>

132
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,376
<i> A tool of the kind</i>
<i> we're discussing here</i>

133
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:22,213
<i> could effortlessly access the</i>
<i> tactical and nuclear arsenals</i>

134
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,782
<i> of most major world powers.</i>

135
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,250
<i> Via his personal computer,</i>

136
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:31,289
<i> a single user would be</i>
<i> imbued with god-like power.</i>

137
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,937
What you're
looking at here is

138
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:47,705
what the Russians
are claiming to be

139
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:49,640
some kind of system
security breach.

140
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:52,677
This is
a Russian topol-m ss-27 missile.

141
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,847
Cold-launched,
three-stage, solid-propellant.

142
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,983
It was wrongly moved
into launch position a week ago.

143
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:02,053
As special division heads,
we urge you to come forward

144
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,921
if this security breach
is a result

145
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,724
of any classified project
you may be working on.

146
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,092
Now, obviously,
we respect the fact

147
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:11,362
you don't want to jeopardize
the security of your projects.

148
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,797
The state department

149
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,966
has requested we cooperate
any way we can...

150
00:17:14,968 --> 00:17:17,435
Oh, shit.

151
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:20,838
- Agent needham?
- Anything to share?

152
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,906
Personal
emergency.

153
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:25,443
Special division doesn't mean
you're actually special.

154
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:27,211
I think it does.

155
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,390
Shit.

156
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:31,976
Sorry.

157
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:16,053
Come on, come on, come on.

158
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,992
Boom.

159
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:24,162
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

160
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,936

It's me, balder.

169
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:31,502
I think I made
a terrible mistake.

170
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,772
Hey!

171
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,837
You did the right thing
by calling me.

172
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:59,043
I have a data-track
on my program.

173
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:00,678
So I know she got to it.

174
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,380
And she won't
give it back to you.

175
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:05,182
Last week...

176
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:10,220
She assaulted one of Stockholm's
most respected businessmen.

177
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:12,122
Emptied his bank accounts.

178
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:16,427
Just one of many men
she's targeted.

179
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,998
I don't know why...

180
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,134
But I thought
I could trust her.

181
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,736
I promise you.

182
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:30,074
I'll do everything in my power
to protect you.

183
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,753
Lisbeth.

184
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:17,454
Hey.

185
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,457
You okay?

186
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,595
I fucked up.

187
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:27,231
I need your help.

188
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:37,141
That's the first test
of project firefall.

189
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,576
It's a tool designed...

190
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:44,181
To breach and control
most online defense systems.

191
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:48,752
Frans balder developed it
for the Americans...

192
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:51,688
And he hired me
to take it back from them.

193
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,490
"Take" as in steal?

194
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:56,693
I think he wanted
to destroy it.

195
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:00,197
Who's that?

196
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:02,132
<i>He's the man</i>
<i> who stole it from me</i>

197
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,401
<i>before I could</i>
<i> give it back to balder.</i>

198
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:07,037
And if you find him...

199
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,906
What are you gonna do?

200
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:13,911
I'm gonna take back
what he stole from me.

201
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:17,314
So you want me
to help you find a ghost?

202
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,849
You're good at that.

203
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:24,655
I couldn't even find you
for three years.

204
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:27,624
You just vanished.

205
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,359
And i--

206
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:43,106
<i>- Flight 825</i>
<i>- from Washington Dulles</i>

207
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:44,775
<i> arriving at gate 47.</i>

208
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:56,086
Mr. Needham. I'm afraid
you have to come with us.

209
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:59,656
<i>- NSA special division</i>
<i>- Edwin needham.</i>

210
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:01,358
Former U.S. military.

211
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,396
Field ops: Afghanistan,
Mexico, Ukraine.

212
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,067
"Special division."

213
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,337
Is that
an American euphemism for

214
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:15,439
"no accountability
and no oversight"?

215
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:17,541
I don't know. Um...

216
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:22,145
I mean, I'm feeling
pretty overseen right now.

217
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:27,050
Look. I'm aware
that someone stole

218
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,052
something
of high value to you.

219
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,255
And I presume you're here
in Stockholm

220
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:33,390
to find that someone?

221
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:39,663
But I'm here to tell you
that that's my job, not yours.

222
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:42,599
The NSA has no business
on Swedish soil.

223
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:47,571
Funny part about that is
I'm not here on business.

224
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:49,273
Pleasure.

225
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:50,908
Is that so?

226
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:55,612
Look,
am I being deported?

227
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:58,348
No. No.

228
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,952
For now,
you're just getting this.

229
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:04,888
A tourist guide?
If you engage in any activities

230
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,491
not listed in that book,
I'll have you arrested

231
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:11,528
and put on the first plane
back to Washington.

232
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:15,232
Now have a nice day.

233
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:17,467
You, too.

234
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,660
You have to take care of this.

235
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:45,595
Okay.

236
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:47,631
And I need to borrow
some gear.

237
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,099
One day we'll talk about

238
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:51,168
your interpretation
of that word.

239
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,704
"Gear"?
"Borrow."

240
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:19,529
You need a hand?
No.

241
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,042
What about balder?

242
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:33,410
Checked out of his hotel.

243
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:36,279
Cell phone disconnected.
But get this:

244
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:37,514
Look who he went to.

245
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,249
His last geotag showed him

246
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:41,118
at sapo headquarters
this morning.

247
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,754
I'm guessing he thinks
you stole this from him,

248
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:46,890
since you missed
the drop-off.

249
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,994
That means she moved him
to a safe house.

250
00:33:50,996 --> 00:33:51,695
Why?

251
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,331
Balder's program had
a freak encryption.

252
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,266
<i> He's the only one</i>
<i> who can open it.</i>

253
00:33:56,268 --> 00:34:00,404
That means these guys are going
after him next.

254
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,475
I find balder...

255
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,778
...i find him.

256
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:13,543
Hello, lisbeth salander.

257
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:23,286
"Sofia novak."

258
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:36,333
The fuck happened here?

259
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,278
Pow.

260
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:56,820
You vilma?

261
00:35:56,822 --> 00:36:00,724
200 crowns a night.
No pets. No drugs. No friends.

262
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:03,226
I can show you
how the heating sy--

263
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:12,602
<i> I got into the sapo servers.</i>

264
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:16,139
<i> They're keeping him</i>
<i> at 774 birger jarlsgatan.</i>

265
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:18,508
<i> There are two plainclothes</i>
<i> officers in a car</i>

266
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:22,846
<i> and several more uniformed</i>
<i> officers on the premises.</i>

267
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,782
<i> Careful, lisbeth.</i>

268
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,323
August. Let's move away
from the window, please.

269
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:09,392
August. August, hey. Hey.

270
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,528
You said it would be
a couple of days

271
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:14,264
and then I'll go
back home to mom.

272
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:15,999
"A couple" means two.

273
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:17,567
No, I'll tell you what.

274
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:18,535
When this is all over,

275
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:21,972
I promise that I'll take you
back to San Francisco.

276
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:23,873
And you'll stay with us.

277
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:25,675
Yeah, of course.

278
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:31,715
Why don't you go back
to your drawing, all right?

279
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,684
All right?

280
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,377
- Whiskey. Neat.
- Sure.

281
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:02,612
I'll have the same.

282
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:05,448
Mikael blomkvist.
Deputy grane.

283
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,350
What a coincidence.

284
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:11,921
This is the man you should
be after. Not salander.

285
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:16,626
Your friend salander has
perpetrated a cyber attack

286
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:20,463
on the most important security
agency in America.

287
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:24,034
I don't really see how
this makes her any less guilty.

288
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:26,736
She doesn't have
the monopoly on guilt.

289
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:29,139
You should be looking
for this man, too.

290
00:38:29,141 --> 00:38:32,075
What makes you think I'm not?

291
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:44,521
Now, if you will excuse me.

292
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,973
Yeah?

293
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:08,244
<i> It's malin. I got a hit</i>
<i> on the spider tattoo.</i>

294
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:09,346
Text it to me.

295
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:11,681
<i> Sure, sending now.</i>

296
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:42,178
You milos?

297
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,615
Do you know this man?

298
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:49,386
He has a tattoo like yours.

299
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:08,538
So are you a cop?

300
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,873
No, worse.

301
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:12,375
I'm a journalist.

302
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:19,182
That guy, he's part
of this group.

303
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:21,217
Heavy people.

304
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:25,388
Pretty much the worst psychos
you can find in Stockholm.

305
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,225
You used to work for them?

306
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:31,694
What makes you think that?

307
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,930
Your tattoo.

308
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,937
This is a scar.

309
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:44,808
He cut it into me
with a knife.
Why?

310
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,178
I used to do photo work.

311
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,846
Tried to sell him
some good ones

312
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:52,916
of a politician
they were blackmailing.

313
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:55,718
I pushed the price too much.

314
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,822
This is what I got
in return.

315
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,371
You like it?

316
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:17,440
I'm sorry.

317
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:27,417
This is what you get when you
try to fuck with the spiders.

318
00:41:27,419 --> 00:41:29,118
"The spiders"?

319
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:33,356
They call him the<i> "otravitel."</i>
He's the worst of them.

320
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:36,192
And if you wanna keep
that pretty face,

321
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:39,028
I'd stop asking about him.

322
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,693
No, thank you, no.

323
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:18,735
Tell me not to worry.

324
00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:21,905
What do you mean?
I've seen this before.

325
00:42:21,907 --> 00:42:24,541
Seen what?
You obsessing over lisbeth.

326
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:26,876
This is not about lisbeth.

327
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,313
Mikael.

328
00:42:30,315 --> 00:42:31,481
There were two key stories

329
00:42:31,483 --> 00:42:33,950
that made your name
and built the magazine.

330
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:37,120
The first you couldn't
have written without her,

331
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:40,390
and the second was about her.

332
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:41,357
I think you are scared

333
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,326
what would become
of mikael blomkvist

334
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:46,029
if there were no
lisbeth salander.

335
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,071
I'm sorry.

336
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:59,075
Lisbeth.
I haven't heard of the spiders.

337
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,377
They sound like
the last people on earth

338
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:04,914
<i> you'd want</i>
<i> to have control of firefall.</i>

339
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,284
You alone?

340
00:43:08,286 --> 00:43:10,920
Do you want me to come over?

341
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:15,892
<i> Lisbeth.</i>
<i> tell me where you are.</i>

342
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:22,398
No.

343
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:26,402
I wouldn't want to ruin
your evening.

344
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:02,505
Hey, who's this?

345
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,042
The blonde there.

346
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:26,396
Who the fuck are you?

347
00:44:26,398 --> 00:44:28,064
Ned the bathroom stalker.

348
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:31,501
Listen, I need to get into
contact with somebody you know.

349
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:34,303
You know
who I'm talkin' about.

350
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,539
What did she give you?

351
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:38,641
A phone?
Some kind of contact?

352
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:40,877
Yeah, she did.

353
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:43,312
Okay, good.

354
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:47,350
Now, listen,
I know you think

355
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:49,552
you're the only girl
she fucking in here.

356
00:44:49,554 --> 00:44:51,354
But I got about three
or four other girls

357
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:54,357
I could be talkin' to.
And that's just in this place.

358
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:57,193
All right? So while
I respect the loyalty,

359
00:44:57,195 --> 00:45:01,364
I gotta say it's a little bit
undeserved.

360
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,901
Bitch.

361
00:45:04,903 --> 00:45:07,370
"Bitch" is right.

362
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:10,673
She gave it to me.

363
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:13,743
It's the only way
I have to contact her.

364
00:45:13,745 --> 00:45:15,278
Hope you find her.

365
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,647
Boom.

366
00:45:17,649 --> 00:45:19,849
I will.

367
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,849
Sal--!

368
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,900
You fucked me.

369
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,953
Fucking bitch!

370
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:55,304
Good morning.
Hey.

371
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:58,808
Did you find your Russian?
Russian?

372
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:02,144
Maybe you misspelled it,
but isn't<i> otravitel</i>

373
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:04,814
Russian crime slang
for "poisoner"?

374
00:48:04,816 --> 00:48:06,849
It's Russian?

375
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,094
What are you doing?

376
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:34,777
Here you go.
They're from holtser.

377
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:38,047
Thank god.
Freezing my balls off.

378
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:41,083
Who is Mr. Holtser?
Me.

379
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:10,680
Lisbeth's father.

380
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:14,250
He was part
of a Russian crime ring.

381
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:12,341
I'll come with you,
but leave him out of it.

382
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:31,320
No.

383
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:48,210
Come on.

384
00:55:56,887 --> 00:55:59,054
That's a good boy.

385
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,324
Safety first.

386
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:08,997
Stop the car!

387
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:43,632
August.
You have to come with me.

388
00:56:43,634 --> 00:56:45,501
Don't.

389
00:56:45,503 --> 00:56:47,269
August.

390
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,807
Go.

391
00:56:51,809 --> 00:56:54,042
Get in the car.

392
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:09,351
Aw, fuck!

393
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:20,976
I want to go back
to my mother, please.

394
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:31,820
"The horses stand
silent in the field."

395
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:39,428
"The snow comes early
this year."

396
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:45,100
You know the answer
to those questions.

397
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:47,669
You know how to open
your father's program.

398
01:01:47,671 --> 01:01:52,174
I want to go back
to my mother, please.

399
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:16,565
<i> Police believe that the killer</i>
<i> has abducted the victim's</i>

400
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:20,469
<i> young son and is still at</i>
<i> large. The suspect has been</i>

401
01:02:20,471 --> 01:02:23,772
<i> identified as lisbeth salander,</i>
<i> a Stockholm resident with</i>

402
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:26,007
<i> a criminal history</i>
<i> ranging from cybercrimes</i>

403
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:30,112
<i> to aggravated assault.</i>

404
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:36,785
<i> She is believed to be armed</i>
<i> and highly dangerous.</i>

405
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:19,761
Mr. Needham.

406
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:22,998
Was this area part of
a walking tour in your guide?

407
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,833
You know,
I always thought a safe house

408
01:03:24,835 --> 01:03:28,069
was supposed to be,
I don't know...Safe?

409
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,707
You're done crashing
around my city like a wild boar.

410
01:03:32,709 --> 01:03:37,379
Arrest him.
Send him back to Disneyland.

411
01:03:57,733 --> 01:04:00,035
You play whites.

412
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,301
Your father taught you?

413
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,304
He's dead now.

414
01:04:36,306 --> 01:04:39,774
Maybe I shouldn't
think of him anymore.

415
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:43,879
Why not?
Because that's the past.

416
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,682
He once said the past,

417
01:04:47,684 --> 01:04:50,619
sometimes,
can be like a black hole.

418
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:54,723
If you get too close...

419
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:56,925
It might pull you in.

420
01:04:56,927 --> 01:04:58,960
And you disappear.

421
01:05:01,531 --> 01:05:04,766
I don't want to disappear.

422
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:08,970
You won't.

423
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:22,517
Who was that woman
on the bridge?

424
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,590
The past.

425
01:05:35,898 --> 01:05:38,466
Hey! Hey!

426
01:05:38,468 --> 01:05:41,002
You don't want
to finish the game?

427
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:43,638
Oh.

428
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,807
Checkmate.

429
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,535
It's okay.

430
01:06:13,537 --> 01:06:17,806
He's a friend.
Hi, August. I'm micke.

431
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:20,442
It's her.

432
01:06:20,444 --> 01:06:23,645
I know. We need to talk.

433
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:35,824
That's for you to keep.

434
01:06:35,826 --> 01:06:38,860
Until the rematch.

435
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:44,232
1,780,099.

436
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:45,800
What's that?

437
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:51,172
It's the answer to "the snow
comes early this year."

438
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:55,110
It's a number problem.
Each letter is a number.

439
01:06:55,112 --> 01:06:56,945
So I figure out
the big number,

440
01:06:56,947 --> 01:06:59,180
then I break it down
into prime factors.

441
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:04,185
Father said he made his program
based on how I think.

442
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,758
You think I'm a freak.

443
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:13,028
No, I don't.

444
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,700
Get some sleep.

445
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:23,805
When I realized that the man
that killed balder

446
01:07:23,807 --> 01:07:25,607
worked for your father,

447
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:28,943
I tracked all of
his ex-associates.

448
01:07:28,945 --> 01:07:30,712
And every one of them
seems to

449
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:32,580
link back to
Camilla salander.

450
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:35,383
She's been picking up
your father's network

451
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:36,384
where he left off.

452
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:39,287
But now she calls them
the spiders.

453
01:07:41,757 --> 01:07:44,926
She worshiped that pig.

454
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:48,530
And now she's become him.

455
01:07:50,801 --> 01:07:52,700
Lisbeth, you're bleeding.

456
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:58,406
I know.

457
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:14,489
Do it.

458
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:33,441
It's done.

459
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:03,538
I bet you can't wait
to write a story about all this.

460
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,843
About me...

461
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:11,412
...and my psycho family.

462
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:13,882
Just like you did last time.

463
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:29,764
Lisbeth.

464
01:09:29,766 --> 01:09:31,299
They need August
to run firefall.

465
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:33,067
Without him,
they have nothing.

466
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:35,737
We have to get him
out of the country.

467
01:09:35,739 --> 01:09:37,605
Out of her reach.

468
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,708
His mother lives
in San Francisco.

469
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:43,945
But even if we did
get him on a plane,

470
01:09:43,947 --> 01:09:46,548
that won't guarantee
his safety.

471
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:48,850
No.

472
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:53,988
But I know someone who can.

473
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:39,867
<i> Ladies and gentlemen, welcome</i>
<i> to Stockholm arlanda airport.</i>

474
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:45,300
What the fu--?

475
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:16,864
Wanted suspect in
terminal 3.

476
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,168
Follow me.

477
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:24,372
Female.
Wearing a bright pink hat.

478
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:46,461
Back in the room.
Back in the room.

479
01:12:46,463 --> 01:12:49,497
Lady, be quiet. Just relax.

480
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:01,109
Hey, you.

481
01:13:01,111 --> 01:13:03,378
Stay in your cell!

482
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:27,969
Passenger needham, please
proceed to gate 45 immediately.

483
01:13:27,971 --> 01:13:33,341
<i> Passenger needham, please</i>
<i> proceed to gate 45 immediately.</i>

484
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:50,458
Salander.

485
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:54,362
North end of the terminal.
Personnel-only door.

486
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:57,732
Tell me you got the boy.

487
01:13:57,734 --> 01:13:58,733
For now.

488
01:13:58,735 --> 01:14:00,868
I need you to get him back
to the U.S.

489
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:02,270
And make sure that he's safe.

490
01:14:02,272 --> 01:14:03,504
<i> No, no, no.</i>

491
01:14:03,506 --> 01:14:06,073
Not without firefall.

492
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:09,944
I have eyes on the American.

493
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:12,346
Without August,
there is no firefall.

494
01:14:12,348 --> 01:14:15,817
You have to let it go.
It's what balder wanted.

495
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:18,653
You don't understand
what this is.

496
01:14:18,655 --> 01:14:21,255
I've spent years waiting for
balder to deliver firefall.

497
01:14:21,257 --> 01:14:23,658
I won't give it up now.
Think you have a choice?

498
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:25,793
What I have is a responsibility
to my country.

499
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:29,297
Something somebody like you
wouldn't understand.

500
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:33,434
I understand
how to open that door.

501
01:14:33,436 --> 01:14:35,570
Shit.

502
01:14:37,573 --> 01:14:38,840
Freeze!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

503
01:14:38,842 --> 01:14:43,010
Agree to take the kid back
to the U.S. or it stays locked.

504
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:46,714
<i> Or you could just jump.</i>

505
01:14:46,716 --> 01:14:49,617
- Fuck.
<i>- Up to you.</i>

506
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:56,624
You! Stop!

507
01:14:56,626 --> 01:14:59,126
<i> I'll get the kid out.</i>

508
01:14:59,128 --> 01:15:01,629
I have your word?

509
01:15:02,064 --> 01:15:03,097
You have my word.

510
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:05,933
I said, on the floor! Now!

511
01:15:18,248 --> 01:15:20,448
Get in the Van.

512
01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:19,574
Dad?

513
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:22,176
<i> Hello?</i>

514
01:16:22,178 --> 01:16:23,644
<i> Hello?</i>

515
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:26,007
Why do you make yourself
so ugly, Libby?

516
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:31,846
I've imagined this moment
for so long.

517
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:35,549
I had a whole speech
prepared.

518
01:17:35,551 --> 01:17:36,917
And now I'm nervous.

519
01:17:36,919 --> 01:17:39,654
I should've
written it down.

520
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:57,638
The boy is secure.

521
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:03,310
Listen, a client
is willing to pay us

522
01:18:03,312 --> 01:18:04,779
a lot of money
for this thing.

523
01:18:04,781 --> 01:18:07,014
I don't care.
Just shoot me.

524
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:10,951
"Shoot you"?

525
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:13,954
You're my sister.

526
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:17,291
Besides,
I have so much to tell you.

527
01:18:22,298 --> 01:18:24,732
Mikael.

528
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:36,610
Someone always has
to carry the pain, Libby.

529
01:18:36,612 --> 01:18:39,213
Well, now it's your turn.

530
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:45,519
Bring her.
Kill the journalist.

531
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,494
Move.

532
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:56,831
Go!

533
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:33,234
No!

534
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:22,583
Hey, man,
you got some creamer?

535
01:20:22,585 --> 01:20:25,152
No, I do not.

536
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,127
'Kay.

537
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:39,500
Please don't touch that.
It's vintage.

538
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:42,036
Yeah.

539
01:20:42,038 --> 01:20:43,871
Uh, when was it, '02?

540
01:20:43,873 --> 01:20:47,007
Took down big pharma
with this bad boy.

541
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:51,145
The king pharma crash was done
from a 7792.

542
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:54,982
Actually,
I did it from a 7770.

543
01:20:54,984 --> 01:20:57,818
But who's counting?

544
01:20:57,820 --> 01:21:00,020
You're warchild?

545
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:02,623
<i> The</i> warchild?

546
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:06,293
Yeah, I was
for a little while.

547
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:11,732
NSA pays way better.
Way motherfuckin' better.

548
01:21:13,902 --> 01:21:16,503
Creamer?
My boy.

549
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:27,047
Heard that went well.

550
01:21:34,856 --> 01:21:36,523
Is that August's location?

551
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:59,747
Where's she takin' him?

552
01:22:02,651 --> 01:22:04,485
Home.

553
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:36,717
Hello, August.

554
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:55,369
You know, a little
birdie told me

555
01:22:55,371 --> 01:22:59,006
you know how to open
your daddy's work.

556
01:23:00,775 --> 01:23:04,445
I need you to do that
for me now.

557
01:23:12,954 --> 01:23:14,655
Hello?

558
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:16,690
Anyone in there?

559
01:23:21,896 --> 01:23:24,231
You will help me.

560
01:23:24,233 --> 01:23:25,499
Soon.

561
01:23:25,501 --> 01:23:27,568
You'll see.

562
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:31,972
Such a big boy.

563
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:55,095
We need to share this
with tactical.

564
01:23:55,097 --> 01:23:57,998
Put together a team. Fast.

565
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,100
Get inside.

566
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:34,621
Okay.

567
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:12,726
<i> Camilla!</i>

568
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:26,073
How did they know?

569
01:27:27,775 --> 01:27:31,111
How did the spiders know
balder's location?

570
01:27:31,113 --> 01:27:33,847
Your guess
is as good as mine.

571
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:45,792
You're the client.

572
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:49,229
You're buying firefall
from her.

573
01:27:51,699 --> 01:27:56,803
Access by a single user
to online nuclear weapons...

574
01:27:56,805 --> 01:28:00,073
Would you rather have that
in the hands of the Americans,

575
01:28:00,075 --> 01:28:02,676
the nation that
never missed a war,

576
01:28:02,678 --> 01:28:05,712
or us, the nation
who never went to war?

577
01:28:05,714 --> 01:28:10,350
Now August and lisbeth are
paying the price for all this.

578
01:28:10,985 --> 01:28:13,020
They'll hurt him.

579
01:28:13,022 --> 01:28:14,554
People have taken
the fall for

580
01:28:14,556 --> 01:28:18,158
far lesser causes,
Mr. Blomkvist.

581
01:28:39,547 --> 01:28:40,514
Do you see him?

582
01:28:40,516 --> 01:28:43,617
Tracker puts August
in the west wing.

583
01:28:55,263 --> 01:28:56,897
<i> Status?</i>

584
01:28:56,899 --> 01:28:59,333
24%.

585
01:29:57,024 --> 01:29:59,259
Get out of there!

586
01:30:11,806 --> 01:30:13,306
Lisbeth!

587
01:30:35,397 --> 01:30:37,130
Give up.

588
01:31:26,681 --> 01:31:28,782
Breathe, lisbeth.

589
01:32:02,251 --> 01:32:05,118
Would you like
a glass of water?

590
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,554
Please get her
a glass of water.

591
01:32:16,564 --> 01:32:20,267
He needs to open
the program for us.

592
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:23,904
Would you please talk
some sense into him?

593
01:32:23,906 --> 01:32:26,239
Fuck you.

594
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:32,646
I made these
just for him.

595
01:32:32,648 --> 01:32:35,582
I will start with this one,
the red one.

596
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:37,183
It will not kill him,

597
01:32:37,185 --> 01:32:39,219
but it will blind him
permanently.

598
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:41,555
The black one, though...

599
01:32:41,557 --> 01:32:43,423
He won't survive.

600
01:32:55,102 --> 01:32:57,103
August.

601
01:32:58,539 --> 01:33:00,874
You have to tell them.

602
01:33:08,015 --> 01:33:10,483
You have to trust me.

603
01:33:14,221 --> 01:33:17,023
<i> To run firefall,</i>
<i> enter value for:</i>

604
01:33:17,025 --> 01:33:21,294

01:33:21,296 --> 01:33:24,197
13, 23, 31.

01:33:24,199 --> 01:33:27,033
115,751.

607
01:33:27,035 --> 01:33:31,338

<i> Access granted.</i>

610

<i> Firefall online.</i>

611
01:33:44,119 --> 01:33:45,952
It's done.

612
01:33:47,688 --> 01:33:50,190
I won't let them keep it.

613
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:03,703
Is that really necessary?

614
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:15,448
I'll transfer the funds
immediately.

615
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:18,184
You don't have to.

616
01:34:18,186 --> 01:34:20,220
Why is that?

617
01:34:24,392 --> 01:34:26,693
It's okay. It's okay.

618
01:34:33,835 --> 01:34:35,335
You can't--

619
01:34:40,374 --> 01:34:43,543
Thanks for
all your help.

620
01:34:44,745 --> 01:34:47,180
But I think
we'll keep it.

621
01:35:42,036 --> 01:35:44,270
Calm down.

622
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:49,042
You'll suffocate.

623
01:35:49,877 --> 01:35:52,245
Trust me, I know.

624
01:35:52,713 --> 01:35:55,248
You know where we are?

625
01:35:56,884 --> 01:35:59,786
This used to be
father's bedroom.

626
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:04,023
Until it became mine, too.

627
01:36:04,025 --> 01:36:06,893
But you know that.

628
01:36:14,068 --> 01:36:17,837
There is something
that you didn't know.

629
01:36:21,108 --> 01:36:23,309
When he died...

630
01:36:25,179 --> 01:36:27,947
An odd thing happened.

631
01:36:30,818 --> 01:36:33,853
It was like an awakening.

632
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:40,026
I could finally see
our father's true face:

633
01:36:41,128 --> 01:36:43,496
A monster's face.

634
01:36:46,934 --> 01:36:49,469
And I was nothing.

635
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:00,947
Do you remember
that morning

636
01:37:00,949 --> 01:37:04,851
that you jumped off the balcony
and left me behind?

637
01:37:06,353 --> 01:37:10,089
The things he did to me
that day.

638
01:37:11,025 --> 01:37:13,526
And the day after.

639
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:19,966
And the day after that.

640
01:37:22,336 --> 01:37:24,971
For 16 years.

641
01:37:26,607 --> 01:37:29,542
And for that, Libby,
I blame you.

642
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:36,182
And so now
the world will burn.

643
01:37:36,684 --> 01:37:40,954
And everyone will know
it was you who lit the match.

644
01:37:46,727 --> 01:37:49,028
Goodbye, Libby.

645
01:38:12,486 --> 01:38:14,187
Okay.

646
01:38:25,699 --> 01:38:27,400
Uh...there.

647
01:38:47,254 --> 01:38:48,621
There.

648
01:39:09,811 --> 01:39:11,511
Targets down.
Give me more.

649
01:39:11,513 --> 01:39:13,746
<i> I got you, warchild.</i>

650
01:39:24,491 --> 01:39:26,326
I need
to get you out--

651
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:34,300
- I have her.
- She's on the move.

652
01:39:57,057 --> 01:39:58,992
Where's the kid?

653
01:40:35,462 --> 01:40:36,629
Come on.

654
01:40:36,631 --> 01:40:38,865
Get up, lisbeth.

655
01:40:40,567 --> 01:40:41,601
Yes!

656
01:40:41,603 --> 01:40:43,202
Move!

657
01:40:45,507 --> 01:40:47,006
Come on. There.

658
01:41:04,224 --> 01:41:05,758
Come on.

659
01:41:28,749 --> 01:41:31,784
<i>- House is clear.</i>
<i>- Where is she?</i>

660
01:41:32,486 --> 01:41:36,956
<i> She's on the other side</i>
<i> of the house. She's leaving.</i>

661
01:41:43,197 --> 01:41:44,530
Go.

662
01:41:46,133 --> 01:41:48,835
<i> You should have visual</i>
<i> on the car.</i>

663
01:41:48,837 --> 01:41:51,070
I see her!

664
01:41:53,340 --> 01:41:55,108
Got her.

665
01:41:59,346 --> 01:42:01,214
Shit.

666
01:42:11,525 --> 01:42:12,725
Shit!

667
01:42:14,728 --> 01:42:16,496
On the move.

668
01:42:19,566 --> 01:42:22,602
<i> She's on the main road</i>
<i> going around the lake.</i>

669
01:42:22,604 --> 01:42:26,205
<i> Cut through the woods</i>
<i> to intercept.</i>

670
01:42:51,131 --> 01:42:52,732
Well done.

671
01:42:52,734 --> 01:42:54,567
Yes, ma'am.

672
01:44:22,656 --> 01:44:26,392
You can't blame me
for leaving that day.

673
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:28,794
"That day"?

674
01:44:31,632 --> 01:44:34,500
This is not about a day.

675
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:38,971
It's about a lifetime.

676
01:44:41,174 --> 01:44:44,443
Are you not
lisbeth salander...

677
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:49,015
The righter of wrongs...

678
01:44:49,449 --> 01:44:53,452
The girl who hurts men
who hurt women?

679
01:44:53,454 --> 01:44:57,123
All those lucky ladies...

680
01:44:58,091 --> 01:45:00,192
Wives...

681
01:45:00,194 --> 01:45:01,494
Mothers...

682
01:45:01,496 --> 01:45:04,263
Sisters.

683
01:45:07,167 --> 01:45:10,403
I could never
figure it out.

684
01:45:14,474 --> 01:45:18,277
Why did you
help everyone but me?

685
01:45:20,847 --> 01:45:23,582
For 16 years...

686
01:45:23,584 --> 01:45:25,751
Every day...

687
01:45:26,186 --> 01:45:29,488
You chose not to save me.

688
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:35,127
I couldn't.

689
01:45:39,132 --> 01:45:41,167
I c--

690
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:45,971
I couldn't go back.

691
01:45:54,081 --> 01:45:55,981
Why?

692
01:46:11,431 --> 01:46:14,500
You chose him.

693
01:46:39,459 --> 01:46:41,360
No!

694
01:47:47,128 --> 01:47:49,094
Oh, yes.

695
01:48:08,114 --> 01:48:10,950
Okay. Okay.
