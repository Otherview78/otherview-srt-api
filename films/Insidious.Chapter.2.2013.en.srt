1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
                                   

2
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,359
Hi. I'm Elise.
You must be Lorraine.

3
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,603
Yes. Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry it's so late.

4
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,919
My day job kind of makes
raising my son a night job.

5
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,319
Don't worry about it.

6
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,199
In my line of work, things tend
to happen when it gets dark.

7
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,565
Please.
Thank you.

8
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,727
Ahoy, Carl!

9
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,648
Elise, thank you for coming.

10
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,239
I didn't know what else
to do, except call you.

11
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,924
Oh, I understand.

12
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,879
You had a big problem
and you thought

13
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,167
you'd make it my problem, too.
Is that it?

14
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,719
Uh, uh...

15
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,559
I'm teasing.

16
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,479
You know I'm always
happy to help, Carl.

17
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,479
Would you like
some coffee or tea?

18
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,399
No, thank you.

19
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,079
I'd like to get started
right away, if that's okay.

20
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,719
Carl told me on the phone

21
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,399
your son is the one
affected, is that right?

22
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,919
Yes, that's right.

23
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,445
My son, Josh.

24
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,282
Something is following him.

25
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,885
Show her.

26
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,639
I started with
all the usual checks,

27
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,961
mental health tests,
medical records.

28
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,650
Everything normal.

29
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,886
Then I saw the photos.

30
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,279
First noticed it
about six weeks ago.

31
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,681
Thought it was
a camera problem.

32
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,724
Then it became apparent
that it was more than that.

33
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,884
I interviewed the boy.

34
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,768
He won't tell me anything.
He's afraid.

35
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,451
I'm afraid, too.

36
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,849
There's something in this house.
I can feel it.

37
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,085
It doesn't want me here.

38
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,605
May I meet him?

39
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,839
<i>Hi, Josh. I'm Elise.</i>

40
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,525
<i>I would love to ask you
some simple questions.</i>

41
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,839
<i>Do you like living here?</i>

42
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,999
Yeah, I guess.

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,810
Are there a lot of kids your
age in this neighborhood?

44
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,679
<i>A few.
One kid lives next door.</i>

45
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,284
That must be fun.

46
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,249
Is there anything you don't like
about living in this house?

47
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,804
<i>I have bad dreams sometimes.</i>

48
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,203
What happens in your dreams?

49
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,199
I'd like to try something
with you, Josh.

50
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,170
And I promise, it won't hurt.

51
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,722
I want you to just relax.

52
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,403
Listen to the ticking.

53
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,039
Focus on it.

54
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,042
Tune everything else out.

55
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,601
Feel yourself getting sleepier.

56
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,727
We are now inside
your dream, Josh.

57
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,279
Look around.

58
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,770
What do you see?

59
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,364
I see myself

60
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,439
sleeping in bed.

61
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,408
Are you in your bedroom?

62
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,359
No.

63
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,249
I'm somewhere dark.

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,759
It's always dark here.

65
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,524
Are you alone?

66
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,251
No.

67
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,719
She's here.

68
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,131
Who is "she"?

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,401
She says she's a friend.

70
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,727
She visits me every night.

71
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,445
Where is she
right at this moment?

72
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,611
Is she here in
this house with us?

73
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,882
I'd like to talk to her.

74
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,479
Okay, we're gonna play
a little game, Josh.

75
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,448
It's called Hot and Cold.

76
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,079
<i>I'll walk around the house,</i>

77
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,051
<i>and you tell me if I'm
getting warmer or colder.</i>

78
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,484
Cold.

79
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,161
Warm.

80
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,851
<i>Warmer.</i>

81
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,208
Colder.

82
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,604
<i>Getting warm.</i>

83
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,323
Hotter.

84
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,245
It's very hot.

85
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,001
Please get out of there.

86
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,569
Who are you?

87
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,290
What do you want?

88
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,119
What happened?

89
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,279
I saw what haunts him,
and it's not a friend.

90
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,199
It's a parasite. I've never
felt such a malignant presence.

91
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,168
It wants to be him.

92
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,566
Miss Lambert,

93
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,319
I think your son has a
unique ability, a gift.

94
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,166
When he sleeps at night, he's
able to go places, see things.

95
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,726
Things no living person
is supposed to see.

96
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,405
Only now, one of the
dead has seen him, too.

97
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,365
Oh, my God.

98
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,491
Well, can you stop it?

99
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,959
I could take away his gift

100
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,519
to suppress his memory
of his ability.

101
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,851
How would we do that?

102
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,049
I'll show you.

103
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,402
Do whatever you have to.
Make him forget.

104
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,686
One morning, Dalton
just wouldn't wake up.

105
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,559
We took him to the best
doctors we could find,

106
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,291
but none of them had any idea.

107
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,639
Eventually,
we just took him home,

108
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,722
still in his coma.

109
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,081
Then things started
happening around the house.

110
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,719
Unexplained things.

111
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,359
I got so freaked out, we moved.

112
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,362
But they kept happening.

113
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:21,330
And you believe that there was
some sort of supernatural force at work?

114
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,359
When did you hire the services

115
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,362
of the deceased Elise Rainier?

116
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,404
When we ran out
of places to go.

117
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,399
It says in your
statement, Mrs. Lambert,

118
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,399
that last night, at
approximately 10:00 p.m.,

119
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,359
Elise put your husband
into a state of hypnosis.

120
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,239
She did this as
part of a ritual that

121
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,919
she believed would allow him to

122
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,239
"project his unconscious
into a..." Uh...

123
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,479
I'm sorry, I can't read
my own handwriting.

124
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,439
"...Into a spirit realm, where
he could locate your son"

125
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,001
"and bring him back
to consciousness."

126
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,925
Now, did you really
believe that would help?

127
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,849
I had to. Whatever
she did, it worked.

128
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,769
Dalton woke up.

129
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,444
And what happened
after your son woke up?

130
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,926
Josh!

131
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,842
Josh, where are you?

132
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,569
Josh!

133
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,286
Renai.

134
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,319
I'm right here.

135
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,243
What?
Renai!

136
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,959
Oh, no, no, no.

137
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,485
Elise! Elise!

138
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,639
Mom, get Dalton out of here!
Call an ambulance!

139
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,959
No, no, no. Elise!

140
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,919
Oh, no!

141
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,285
No, no!

142
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,321
What?

143
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,762
Why are you looking
at me like that?

144
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,725
You think I did this?

145
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,648
Did you believe him?

146
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,639
He's my husband. That's
not what I asked.

147
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:35,043
Yes, I believed him. My husband
isn't capable of killing anybody.

148
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,079
This is a photo Elise took
seconds before she was killed.

149
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,606
Can you tell me who that
is in this picture?

150
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,079
There were a lot of strange
things happening in our house.

151
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,199
I saw apparitions,
lots of them.

152
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,204
Are you telling me that this
is a photograph of a ghost?

153
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,490
Listen, I'm not interested
in ghosts, Mrs. Lambert.

154
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,206
I'm interested in the living
people who create them.

155
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,799
Elise has marks on her neck

156
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,882
that were put there
by human hands.

157
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,046
I'll let you know if forensics
matches those marks to your husband.

158
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,359
Jessica, we're home.

159
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,399
Hey, guys.

160
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,239
Dad! Look what I made. Hey.

161
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,719
What?
It's a cup phone.

162
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,559
See? You put your ear in that,
and I put my mouth in that.

163
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,959
You are a genius. Absolute brilliance.
Thanks for watching them.

164
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,720
Say hi to your mom from me.
I will.

165
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,599
Oh. Mom,
I'll get that.

166
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,364
I'll go up and make the beds.

167
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,119
All right.

168
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,719
Time for bed, boys.

169
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,519
How long are we
gonna be here for?

170
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,759
We're gonna be at Grandma's
house for a little bit

171
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,842
while the police
work at our house.

172
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,199
You know, this house has been
in the family for a long time.

173
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,884
And you eyes

174
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,806
get to stay in
Daddy's old bedroom.

175
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,883
Did you see
anything bad in here?

176
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,005
No.

177
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,679
And neither will you, okay?

178
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,806
Okay.

179
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,285
Good night.

180
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,042
What?

181
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,369
Just glad you're awake.

182
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,559
Good night, boys.

183
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,641
Good night.

184
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,479
Hey, Dalton.

185
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,720
What?

186
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,999
Look what I made.

187
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,490
Do I have to?

188
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,765
Yeah.

189
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,527
This is stupid.

190
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,279
Come on, it really works. I wanna
ask you something, all right?

191
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,799
All right, fine. The
string needs to be tight.

192
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,609
Go farther back.
Okay.

193
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,967
So, what do you think of this?

194
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,639
I think it's stupid.

195
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,971
Hey.

196
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,250
Lorraine?

197
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,441
It's okay.

198
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,684
It's still happening.
What is?

199
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,959
I heard the piano playing
by itself downstairs

200
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,559
and I found Kali on the floor
of her room by her crib!

201
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,959
Well, maybe she
climbed out of her crib.

202
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,439
Has she ever done that before?

203
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,204
What? What is
wrong with you?

204
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,959
Renai, I just want us to move
on from this, that's all.

205
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,440
I want us to be
a normal family again.

206
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,839
There is nothing normal about this, okay?
These things are still here.

207
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,083
Elise is dead! No one's talking about it!
Someone murdered her!

208
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,399
Then let's talk about it.

209
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,890
You think I did it?

210
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,239
No. No, I don't.

211
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,559
Good. Good.

212
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,919
Because I know what happened.

213
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,359
I went into that place
to get our son back

214
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,443
and something evil followed
me and killed Elise.

215
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,279
You saw it.

216
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,850
You saw those things.

217
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,729
Listen to me. Nothing is gonna
bother us, not anymore.

218
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,169
We have our family back.

219
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,924
We have our son.

220
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,008
Isn't that what
we should be focusing on?

221
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,164
Yeah.

222
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,079
You think all the
ghosts we've seen

223
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,129
would somehow make me feel
better that Elise is gone.

224
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,119
I mean, you and I have

225
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,647
firsthand knowledge that there's
something out there beyond death.

226
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,927
But it's not helping.

227
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,047
Turns out the living version
of someone is always better.

228
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,211
She never left the
reading room unlocked.

229
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,644
You first.

230
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,204
Hunter, ninja, bear.

231
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,130
Hunter, ninja, bear.

232
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,650
That's bullshit.

233
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,199
How does a bear
beat a goddamn ninja?

234
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,043
Superior sense
of smell, my friend.

235
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,119
You know what? I don't think
we should be down here.

236
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,441
Let's go back.

237
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,130
That's a private room.
You should stay...

238
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,722
See?
Oh, my nuts!

239
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,324
I'm not helping.

240
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,641
<i>Hi, Josh. I'm Elise.</i>

241
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,121
<i>Hey.</i>

242
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,481
<i>I would love to ask you
some simple questions.</i>

243
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,719
<i>But they're the good kind,
the kind you can't get wrong.</i>

244
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,960
<i>Do you like living here?</i>

245
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,239
<i>Yeah.</i>

246
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,244
Amateur framing.
Just horrible.

247
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,319
<i>A few.
One kid lives next door.</i>

248
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,119
<i>Can you stop it?</i>

249
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,279
<i>I could try
to take away his gift</i>

250
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,519
<i>to suppress his
memory of his ability.</i>

251
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,919
<i>How would we do that?</i>

252
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,126
<i>I'll show you.</i>

253
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,124
Who the hell's he talking to?

254
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,519
<i>I could try
to take away his gift,</i>

255
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,170
<i>to suppress his
memory of his ability.</i>

256
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,479
<i>How would we do that?</i>

257
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,527
<i>I'll show you.</i>

258
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,721
Right there.

259
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,089
...sleep.
Then I flew away.

260
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,006
Please don't leave us again.

261
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,681
Grandma?

262
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,681
Mmm-hmm.

263
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,401
There's someone
standing behind you.

264
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,605
Renai?

265
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,919
Oh, my God, Josh!
Mom!

266
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,570
Did you see her?
I saw someone!

267
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,610
No, you didn't. No, I did!
There was somebody...

268
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,159
Ma, there is no one here, okay?

269
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,359
Because if there was,
that would scare my family,

270
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,125
and I don't need Renai hearing
any of that stuff right now.

271
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,961
Understand?

272
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,968
Yeah, you're right.
Um...

273
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,731
It was probably my imagination.

274
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,199
Yeah.

275
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,726
Sorry. You should
get some sleep.

276
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,520
You want some more?

277
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,961
All right, go farther back so we can stretch it.
We need to make it tight.

278
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,559
Daddy?

279
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,239
I gotcha! I gotcha!
Oh, my God!

280
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,079
I'm going to eat you.

281
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,081
Mom?

282
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,804
Hey, honey, what do you
want for breakfast?

283
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,209
Anything you want.

284
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,441
I don't care.

285
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,326
What's wrong?

286
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,169
What's the matter?
You can tell me.

287
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,411
I had a bad dream.

288
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,599
Okay.

289
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,967
I'm sorry.
What was it about?

290
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,086
I was in my bed sleeping.

291
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,564
Grandma walked in.

292
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,488
I could see someone
else in my room.

293
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,962
<i>Please don't leave us again.</i>

294
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,529
<i>Grandma?</i>

295
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,201
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

296
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,251
<i>There's someone
standing behind you.</i>

297
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,599
I tried to wake myself up.

298
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,359
It took a while, but I did it.

299
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,840
I heard voices in the hallway.

300
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,121
You got to go.

301
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,759
You have to go.

302
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,839
<i>It was Daddy.</i>

303
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,879
You have to leave.

304
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,008
And he was talking to someone.

305
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,610
You have to go.

306
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,008
Is there something
wrong with Daddy, Mom?

307
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,365
No.

308
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,919
No, honey.

309
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,888
He's just been through a lot.

310
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,639
That's all.
We all have.

311
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,847
It's okay, it's just a dream.

312
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,319
I'm gonna take
the boys to school.

313
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,129
You should rest, relax a bit.

314
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,645
Come on, son.

315
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,041
Okay.

316
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,519
Are you okay, Lorraine?

317
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,599
You said something was wrong.

318
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,604
Whatever it was
that killed Elise,

319
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,088
whatever it was that
was haunting my family

320
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,409
is not done with us.

321
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,449
Last night I saw
someone in my house.

322
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,925
I need your help.

323
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,159
Do you remember the first
time Elise visited your house

324
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,279
to talk to Josh
when he was a boy?

325
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,199
No. I did a lot
to try to...

326
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,879
Try to forget that part of
my life, until recently.

327
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,439
All right. Well,
Elise hypnotized him,

328
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,639
asked him a series
of questions.

329
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,962
I digitized the actual footage
taken from the night.

330
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,601
I cropped and
lightened the image.

331
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,081
What?

332
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,926
Lorraine, is that Josh?

333
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,890
How is that possible?

334
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,770
We don't know.

335
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,526
If only Elise
were here to help us.

336
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,610
What?

337
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,399
Hello?

338
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,210
<i>Renai Lambert,
this is Detective Sendai.</i>

339
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,481
Oh.

340
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,559
Hello, Detective.

341
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,159
<i>I told you I would inform you
once I got the forensics results.</i>

342
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,366
<i>Well, I got some.</i>

343
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,319
<i>It seems the bruises
on Elise Rainier's neck</i>

344
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,839
<i>do not match your
husband's hands.</i>

345
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,159
<i>We're not ruling
anything out at this point,</i>

346
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,969
<i>but I just thought
you should know.</i>

347
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,442
Thank you, Detective.
Uh...

348
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,084
I really needed to hear that.
Thank you.

Kali?

355
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,759
Kali, what's wrong?

356
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,919
Kali! Kali!

361
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,325
Kali!

362
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,361
Kali!

363
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,479
Kali!

364
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,039
Kali? Baby?

365
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,319
My baby, Kali. Kali.

366
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,924
Don't you dare!

367
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,369
He's here.

368
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,999
Carl, I'm Specs. I'm the guy
you spoke to on the phone.

369
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,650
Oh, hello!
Come in.

370
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,839
Hi, Carl.
Oh.

371
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,842
It's been a long time.

372
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,246
Yeah.

373
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,039
Looks like I did the
aging for the both of us.

374
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,319
Oh, please stop it.

375
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,800
You met Specs.
This is Tucker.

376
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,091
Elise talked about you a lot.

377
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,999
Oh. Yeah, said you were
the second best person

378
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,079
she ever worked with.

379
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,321
Second best, that's generous.

380
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,250
I had been meaning to catch
up with her, to call her.

381
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,999
But I always kept putting it off
till the next week, you know?

382
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,319
And now she's gone.

383
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,399
Well, maybe this is your
chance to say your good-byes.

384
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,961
Specs told me on the phone,
but I'm not sure we should...

385
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,959
We have questions
that need answering,

386
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,328
and the only person we could
think of to ask is Elise.

387
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,124
Please help us, Carl.

388
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,484
Help us contact her.

389
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,650
Everybody has their
own way of making contact.

390
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,239
This is mine.

391
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,801
I ask questions and the
spirits answer with the dice.

392
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,889
You look for the words
in the letters.

393
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,927
Elise, we are
calling out to you.

394
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,570
Tell us if you are there.

395
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,810
Elise, please talk to us.

396
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,924
Give us a sign that
you can hear my voice.

397
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,759
All right, I suppose
I should've explained

398
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,040
that this isn't
an exact science.

399
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,726
Sometimes contact
can't be made.

400
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,961
Elise.

401
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,529
Please tell me, are you here?

402
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,885
Are you here?

403
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,719
I'll go get...
No!

404
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,165
Do not break the circle.

405
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,042
Elise.

406
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,839
We need to know who killed you.

407
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,841
Tell us.

408
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,689
"She did."

409
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,450
What does she want?

410
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,601
I see it.

411
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,481
Where?

412
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,921
Where is she?

413
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,044
"Hiding."

414
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,881
Where is she hiding?

415
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,768
Elise, tell us where
to find your killer.

416
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,691
"Our Lady Angls"?

417
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,919
Our Lady Angls,
what does that mean?

418
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,922
It's "Angels."

419
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,771
Our Lady of the Angels.

420
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,565
It's a hospital.

421
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,760
I know because
I used to work there.

422
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,450
Renai?

423
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,609
Renai.

424
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,239
Most of my work
was in this East Wing.

425
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,159
But it's all closed now.

426
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,844
Now only the ghosts are left.

427
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,244
Personally, I
prefer the ghosts to people.

428
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,644
The question is,
what are we looking for?

429
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,728
Elise led us here for a reason.

430
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,639
Just forget
the actual building.

431
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,799
Think of the doctors,
the nurses you worked with,

432
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,609
the patients, everyone.

433
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,844
<i>Mama! Mama!</i>

434
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,564
What is it?

435
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,250
In there.

436
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,123
What was in this room?

437
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,441
This was an ICU.

438
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,922
I remember it very well.

439
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,759
Should we do
pizza night tonight?

440
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,921
How about mac and cheese?

441
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,119
Hi, Pam.
Hi, Lorraine.

442
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,599
Mac and cheese.

443
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,489
Okay, that can be done.

444
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,368
Keep quiet.
Don't touch anything.

445
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,199
How is he?

446
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,759
His vital signs
are stabilizing,

447
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,205
but he's still unresponsive.

448
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,959
His blood
pressure's doing better.

449
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,599
Yes, after we upped the dosage.

450
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,679
- Okay, let's keep him on that.
- Okay.

451
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,251
And when was the last
time you checked the glucose?

452
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,808
It's okay.
It's okay.

453
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,680
<i>A few days
later, I saw him again.</i>

454
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,970
<i>For the last time.</i>

455
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,719
Parker, what are you...

456
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,644
You should be resting.
You shouldn't be out of bed.

457
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,679
Listen, I wanna apologize
for my son the other day.

458
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,842
He was being a nosy kid.

459
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,639
Hey, Hillary, why is the
patient from Room 104

460
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,880
up and walking around?

461
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,479
What do you mean?

462
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,960
The patient from ICU,
Parker Crane?

463
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,719
What do you mean,
walking around?

464
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,039
I just rode down in
the elevator with him.

465
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,719
He should be in bed,
on the monitor...

466
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,519
Lorraine, that patient
died yesterday morning.

467
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,851
What?

468
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,405
He jumped to his death.

469
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,606
So, why was he
here in the first place?

470
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,481
He tried to castrate himself.

471
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,681
Oh, no.

472
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,279
No.

473
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,279
No, not yet.

474
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,479
Please, no.

475
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:58,639
<i>Your dead soul
is killing his living skin.</i>

476
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,839
I wanna live.

477
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,959
I wanna live!

478
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,959
<i>Only if you kill them.</i>

479
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,479
No. Please, no.

480
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,399
I can't, Mother.

481
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,639
Please don't make me do it.

482
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,679
<i>You must!</i>

483
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,924
<i>Or you'll waste</i> away.

484
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,879
Yes, we can.

485
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,370
No way.
Lorraine!

486
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,959
Is that our man?

487
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,530
Parker Crane, that's him.

488
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,322
This address,
there's something there.

489
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,368
It's okay, it's okay.
Renai.

490
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,679
It's okay. It's okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

491
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,045
Oh, God.
You're okay.

492
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,119
Where's Kali?

493
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,724
She's fine.
She's in her room sleeping.

494
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,406
She's fine. No, she's not!
No, she's not!

495
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,603
She's asleep! Renai! No! No!

496
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,131
Kali.

497
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:21,284
See? I told you,
she's fine.

498
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,759
Oh, God! What happened? Tell me.

499
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,886
Someone attacked me!

500
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,199
Who?

501
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,124
In the living room, a woman. She hit me.
These things are back, Josh!

502
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,879
We have to go!
We gotta get the kids

503
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,559
and we gotta get
out of the house!

504
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,919
No, it's not the house.
You know that.

505
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,119
We've been through this before.

506
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,559
They will follow us. You
have to just not be afraid.

507
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,879
You have to relax.

508
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,239
Relax? I can't relax!

509
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,479
There's ghosts everywhere!

510
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,919
It's like we're already dead!

511
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,410
No, it's not!

512
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,919
No, it's not.

513
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,241
This is nothing
like being dead.

514
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,919
I know.
I have seen it.

515
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,763
I have seen where
these things exist.

516
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,919
They want what you have.

517
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,399
Life.

518
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,479
But they have
no power over you.

519
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:11,041
All you have to do is ignore
them, and they will go away.

520
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,803
See, I told you.

521
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,122
What are you doing?

522
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,689
That's the song
that's been playing.

523
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,604
What song?
What are you talking about?

524
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,931
You don't know that song?

525
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,250
No, I don't.

526
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,524
That's my song,
the song I wrote for you?

527
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,845
Well, it's not the song that
we should be worried about.

528
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,161
There's somebody in this house.

529
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,290
Stay here.

530
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,522
Hey, look,
they left the window open.

531
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,690
Watch your step.

532
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,719
Do you feel something?

533
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,721
Um...

534
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:42,439
Let's just say that
this house is not a place

535
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,761
where many good things
have happened.

536
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,491
Probably a lot of good
collectibles in here.

537
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,965
What is that smell?

538
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,119
Hey, Specs.

539
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,121
Yeah.

540
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,001
Upstairs.

541
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,846
I'm guessing this might
be Parker Crane's bedroom.

542
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,439
No, it seems a little
girly for a boy's bedroom,

543
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,519
don't you think?

544
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,851
Why?

545
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,288
I mean, look at this dollhouse.

546
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,970
What?

547
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,409
I had a dollhouse.

548
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,568
This is a Rhode Island Red.

549
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,682
Come on, let's get outta here.

550
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,721
This is my room!

551
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,969
Tucker!

552
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,880
Listen,
Tucker. Tucker.

553
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,081
You can't be in here.

554
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,127
If she sees you,
she'll make me kill you.

555
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,886
<i>Dalton.</i>

556
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,961
<i>Dalton.</i>

557
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,605
What?

558
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,327
<i>I have something to show you.</i>

559
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,319
Stop, Foster.

560
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:46,479
Just go back to bed. You're
gonna get us in trouble.

561
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,484
<i>I'm not Foster.</i>

562
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,205
Foster, wake up.

563
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,839
Foster, please wake up!

564
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,961
Who are you?

565
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:03,331
<i>The ones he killed.</i>

566
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,801
<i>We are many.</i>

567
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,164
What do you want?

568
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,206
<i>Please help me!</i>

569
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,847
<i>Make the pain stop!</i>

570
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,559
It's okay! It's okay! It's okay!

571
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,723
It's okay!
It's okay! It's okay!

572
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:57,209
Oh, Jesus.
Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

573
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,529
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

574
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:04,639
It was just a dream.
It's just a dream.

575
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,961
It's just a dream.

576
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,481
You're trying to reach
her, but you won't.

577
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,004
Not from over there.

578
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,008
Shadows are your home now.

579
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,571
<i>Help!</i>

580
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,691
Elise.

581
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,930
Why did you bring us here?

582
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,967
What are we looking for?

583
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,368
<i>"Mors".</i>

584
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,771
Latin for "Death"?

585
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,201
Carl.

586
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,679
This is the woman
who was in my house.

587
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,686
Lorraine, look out!

588
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,604
What happened?

589
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,079
What happened?
Give me a light over here.

590
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,445
Over here!

591
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,329
You're not Elise, are you?

592
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,205
Who are you?

593
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,251
Mother of Death.

594
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,524
What does that mean?

595
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,079
It's literal.

596
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:50,119
It simply means the mother

597
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,849
of Parker Crane.

598
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,931
Okay, move that.

599
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,959
One, two, and three.

600
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,845
Pull it this way.

601
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,249
Don't touch anything.

602
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,971
Guys.

603
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,368
"Bride in Black."

604
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,170
I know that name.

605
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,403
Where? What you got?

606
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,531
"One of the victims
managed to elude the killer."

607
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:39,279
"Police said she
described her attacker"

608
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:44,889
"as an old woman dressed in a
black wedding gown and veil."

609
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,922
"Bride in Black
claims his 15th victim."

610
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:52,687
Victims.

611
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,130
Oh, my God.

612
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:04,846
Wait a sec.

613
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:07,521
Uh...

614
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:37,599
Parker wore that dress

615
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,364
to commit these murders.

616
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,808
It was his disguise.

617
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,649
He killed for his mother
because she forced him to.

618
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,326
He wanted his childhood back.

619
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,682
That's why he went
after your son.

620
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:18,839
Renai!
Jesus! Lorraine!

621
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:19,999
Where have you been?

622
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,399
I need to speak to you.

623
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,559
Where is he, Josh?

624
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,599
He's not feeling well.
He's been in bed all day.

625
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,879
And where are
Dalton and Foster?

626
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,199
I just dropped
them off at Jessica's.

627
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,719
Why? You and the
kids are in danger.

628
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,801
I'll explain, but not here.

629
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,081
Please, let's just
get in the car and go.

630
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,731
Have you been seeing them, too?

631
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:36,370
Around the house?

632
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:41,008
It's not the house, it's Josh.

633
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,729
They're gone.
It's go time.

634
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,399
Okay.
We'll hear everything.

635
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,439
Sing out if you need us.

636
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:15,011
The code word
is "Quesadilla."

637
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:16,799
Say it with me. Quesadilla.
"Quesadilla."

638
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,119
I thought we agreed on
"Unicorn" as the code word.

639
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,439
Uh... "Quesadilla" is easier
to bring up in conversation.

640
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,919
Not at all.
How would you bring up

641
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,119
"quesadilla" in a conversation?

642
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,599
It's lunch time. It's quesadilla time.
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

643
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,559
I'd love a quesadilla.
Can I have a quesadilla?

644
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,799
Really?

645
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,609
I don't think it matters.

646
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,688
You'll know if I need you.
It doesn't matter.

647
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,804
Tranquilizer.

648
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,120
Can I help you?

649
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,286
My name's Carl.

650
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,319
Uh, I know you don't
remember me, Josh.

651
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:05,439
Elise and I did our best
to make sure of that.

652
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,329
You're right,
I don't remember you.

653
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:11,719
Your mother called me when you
started experiencing some problems

654
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:16,408
<i>and what I saw scared me so badly
that I, uh, reached out to Elise.</i>

655
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,009
Now Elise is gone.

656
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:22,927
I was wondering if you could
help give me some closure.

657
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,171
I need it.

658
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,687
Sure.

659
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,727
Okay.

660
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,639
Phew!

661
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,439
This is pretty exciting.

662
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,408
I feel like an FBI agent.

663
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:58,159
Tell me what you're thinking.
Lorraine, what do you know?

664
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:01,926
I think that when Josh went
into that other world,

665
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,570
something else came back.

666
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:08,759
We believe it's a
spirit that's killed

667
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,159
many times before,
and it'll kill again.

668
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,199
That's why I had to get you
and the kids away from him.

669
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,239
Last night, when I
looked into his eyes,

670
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:20,359
like I have every day
for the last 12 years,

671
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:23,091
was the first time
I didn't recognize him.

672
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,879
I was scared of him.

673
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,199
Right now, at the house,

674
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:31,239
there is an acquaintance of Elise's
and mine, and he's talking to Josh.

675
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,999
We're going to try to sedate
him and when he's under,

676
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,039
we're going to try to reach
out to the real Josh.

677
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,963
And what if we can't find him?

678
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,168
Are you feeling okay?

679
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,765
I'm fine.

680
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,320
Just woke up feeling
a little under the weather.

681
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:55,079
I suppose I wanted to ask you

682
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:58,119
if you've any idea
what happened to Elise.

683
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,884
No, I don't.

684
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,281
Look, I...

685
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:07,399
I should remind you that, um...

686
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,719
I'm not the person who's
gonna look at you funny

687
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,639
if you tell me
something unusual.

688
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:13,641
Mmm-hmm.

689
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,331
I've seen things
with my own eyes

690
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:20,169
that most people have to
go to sleep to conjure up.

691
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:24,967
Elise sent me to a place
that still haunts my dreams.

692
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,848
But I got my son back.

693
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,679
I don't know, I left the
room for about 10 minutes,

694
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,604
and when I came back,
Elise was dead.

695
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,690
She had been strangled.

696
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,249
That's pretty horrific.

697
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:51,841
I guess.

698
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,241
Oh!

699
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,321
Um...

700
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,119
When you were a boy,

701
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:02,090
you said it was an old
woman who haunted you.

702
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,159
Did you see that same old woman

703
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,685
when you were in
that other world?

704
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,246
No.

705
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:13,566
Okay. Um...

706
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,566
Say, would you like a drink?

707
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,889
Water. A glass of
water would be nice.

708
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:28,721
Sure.

709
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:55,567
What you got there?

710
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:58,524
Huh? Oh. Uh...

711
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,727
Nothing.

712
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,241
I thought maybe you were
playing with your dice.

713
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,206
Excuse me?

714
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:08,091
Mother tells me you
like to play with dice.

715
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:12,890
Did she? I didn't realize you
guys had spoken this morning.

716
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,566
It's how I do my readings.

717
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:17,721
Ah.

718
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,081
What have you got
behind your back?

719
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:31,771
Why don't you ask your dice
what I have behind my back?

720
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,445
Come on, roll them and see.

721
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:42,724
Mother tells me you were very
good with them at the house.

722
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,681
Come on, it'll be fun.

723
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,441
What...

724
01:12:58,560 --> 01:12:59,925
What does Josh...

725
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:09,121
What is Parker Crane
holding behind his back?

726
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,481
She was always right.

727
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,361
Shit!

728
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:31,481
Ah!

729
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,170
Come on!

730
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,040
Quesadilla.

731
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,045
- Carl!
- In here!

732
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:58,761
I got you!

733
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:49,081
<i>I know you, don't I?</i>

734
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:54,367
<i>Well, if you're here, I guess I
don't have to ask where I am.</i>

735
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,924
<i>He killed you.</i>

736
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,879
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

737
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,719
<i>That thing is gonna murder my
family if I don't get back.</i>

738
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,119
<i>I am trapped here.
I'm getting weaker</i>

739
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,441
<i>the longer I'm away
from my body.</i>

740
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,285
<i>Elise.</i>

741
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,689
<i>Elise, she's not here.</i>

742
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,648
<i>Well, then we'll
have to find her.</i>

743
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,282
<i>Into the Further we go.</i>

744
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:48,399
<i>You need to kill the others.</i>

745
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,847
<i>It's the only
way to stay alive.</i>

746
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,759
Shut up! Shut up!
Get out of my head!

747
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,479
Shut up!
Get outta here!

748
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,084
Get out of my head!

749
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:13,922
Okay, I've just got a message from Tucker.
He says they're ready.

750
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,371
<i>Elise?</i>

751
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:27,647
<i>Elise!</i>

752
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,243
<i>Don't do that.</i>

753
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,479
<i>What is it?</i>

754
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:47,528
<i>There's someone
standing in front of you.</i>

755
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,719
<i>I don't see anybody.</i>

756
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,882
<i>He's right in front of you!</i>

757
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:57,681
<i>He's...</i>

758
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,165
<i>He's talking to you.</i>

759
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,519
<i>What's he saying?</i>

760
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:03,879
<i>"He's got your baby."</i>

761
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:07,362
<i>"He's got your baby. He's got your baby.
He's got your baby."</i>

762
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:10,040
<i>He's got your baby.
He's got your baby.</i>

763
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,731
<i>What's he doing now?</i>

764
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,159
<i>He...</i>

765
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,367
<i>He's pointing at something.</i>

766
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,845
<i>Over there.</i>

767
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,679
<i>I heard this noise coming from Kali's room.
It was on the baby monitor.</i>

768
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:40,839
<i>Probably just interference.</i>

769
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:41,919
<i>I don't know.</i>

770
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:46,279
It sounded so clear. It was
like this whispering. It was...

771
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:47,930
Scared the hell out of me.

772
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,039
<i>Then I went to hear the
monitor and turned up the volume</i>

773
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:53,399
<i>and heard a man's voice.</i>

774
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:56,722
<i>I ran up there
and I looked inside.</i>

775
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:03,399
<i>Probably just some noise.
Those things always pick up...</i>

776
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,689
<i>No! No! No.</i>

777
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:14,330
<i>No! Hey!</i>

778
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:19,926
Who the hell is that?

779
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,966
Hold on.

780
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,480
Stay here.

781
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,370
<i>Renai!</i>

782
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,325
Hello?

783
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,045
<i>No. Josh, no!</i>

784
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:27,319
Josh! Josh! Quick! There's someone in here!
Someone in the curtains!

785
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,359
<i>Josh! Josh!</i>

786
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,361
<i>Renai!</i>

787
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,491
<i>Renai!</i>

788
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,359
<i>Get away from her!</i>

789
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,362
<i>Get away from her!</i>

790
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,490
<i>Go to hell!</i>

791
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,521
<i>Josh.</i>

792
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,364
<i>I wish I could say
it's good to see you.</i>

793
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,244
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

794
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,766
<i>You shouldn't be here.</i>

795
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,960
<i>We all pass through
this place eventually.</i>

796
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,806
<i>Hopefully, on our way
to someplace better.</i>

797
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,364
<i>I've seen that better place,</i>

798
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:43,406
<i>but I came back here
because I heard you calling,</i>

799
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,091
<i>and I think I can help.</i>

800
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:50,169
<i>Carl, what are you doing here?</i>

801
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,879
<i>You are not
supposed to be here.</i>

802
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:54,609
<i>I failed you, Elise.</i>

803
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,086
<i>Oh...</i>

804
01:20:56,360 --> 01:21:00,001
<i>No, you didn't.
No, you didn't.</i>

805
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:03,444
<i>You were looking for Josh
and you found him.</i>

806
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,399
<i>Josh, you don't belong here,</i>

807
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,919
<i>and neither does that entity
belong in your world.</i>

808
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:11,279
<i>I don't know how to fight her.</i>

809
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,119
<i>Out there in the darkness,</i>

810
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:17,639
<i>she has a home where all her
memories live from her life.</i>

811
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,399
<i>Use those memories to draw
her out of your vessel</i>

812
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,368
<i>so that you can get
back into your body.</i>

813
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,530
<i>But where do I find her home?</i>

814
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,679
<i>Only you know where that is.</i>

815
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,045
<i>I don't remember.</i>

816
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:34,361
<i>Maybe we're asking
the wrong Josh.</i>

817
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:41,879
What happened?

818
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:45,168
I saw what haunts him, and it's not a friend.
It's a parasite.

819
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:48,119
I've never felt such
a malignant presence.

820
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:50,159
<i>It wants to be him.</i>

821
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:55,121
<i>Miss Lambert, I think your son
has a unique ability, a gift.</i>

822
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:03,406
<i>Josh.</i>

823
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,644
<i>I need your help.</i>

824
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:11,039
<i>I don't have any memories
of the old woman anymore,</i>

825
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,883
<i>but you do.</i>

826
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,882
<i>I need to know where she lives.</i>

827
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:26,846
<i>I'll show you.</i>

828
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,766
<i>So that's what that was about.</i>

829
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,085
Carl?

830
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:48,250
Josh?

831
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,204
Josh?

832
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:56,922
Hi, honey.

833
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,208
I'm waiting for the boys.
They're not home yet.

834
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,807
Did my friend
Carl stop by today?

835
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,849
No, I don't think so.

836
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,925
You did this to yourselves!

837
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,839
It's been so long
since I felt real pain.

838
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,490
Renai, help me!

839
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:47,480
I missed it, but not as much as
I miss inflicting it on others.

840
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,483
Renai, get out
of here! Run!

841
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,371
I'll come back for you, Mommy!

842
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,319
- Okay, guys, we're here.
- Yay!

843
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:36,399
Thanks, Jessica.

844
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,999
- Thank you.
- No problem. See you tomorrow.

845
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,331
Let's go, Foster.

846
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:42,685
I didn't want this, Renai.

847
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:47,123
She wanted me to kill
you, but I said no.

848
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,083
But now, I know she was right.

849
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:05,562
You are a miserable,
ungrateful bitch.

850
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:08,039
You have no idea
how much you've wasted

851
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:09,485
your life being
afraid of the dead,

852
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,570
because pretty soon, you're
going to be one of them.

853
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:16,963
Then, when I take you
to my home in the dark,

854
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:20,199
you'll realize how happy
you should've been

855
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:23,090
for your brief,
little moment in the sun.

856
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:43,680
Mommy! Mommy!

857
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,599
Daddy! No!

858
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,290
Come on!

859
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,721
<i>Hello?</i>

860
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:47,879
<i>My name is Parker!</i>

861
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:49,370
<i>What is this?</i>

862
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,527
<i>Did you do this?</i>

863
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,644
<i>Don't you dare!</i>

864
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:02,046
<i>But, Mommy...</i>

865
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,804
<i>Speak the truth.</i>

866
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:10,160
<i>Did you?</i>

867
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:15,564
<i>Yes.
That is not your name!</i>

868
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:19,682
<i>Parker is not your name!</i>

869
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:23,123
<i>That is the name
your father gave you!</i>

870
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:25,448
<i>Your name</i>

871
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,130
<i>is Marilyn.</i>

872
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:31,123
<i>Do you understand?</i>

873
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:34,969
<i>Repeat after me.</i>

874
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:39,483
<i>"My name is Marilyn. "</i>

875
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,959
<i>Say it!</i>

876
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,689
<i>My name is...</i>

877
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:48,491
<i>Marilyn.</i>

878
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,687
<i>Quiet, now.</i>

879
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:59,724
<i>If you don't be a good
little girl, you'll get...</i>

880
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,479
Mommy, Mommy, I can go
into the dark place

881
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,159
and find Daddy,
if I go to sleep.

882
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,759
No, it's too dangerous.

883
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:25,159
I nearly lost you once before.

884
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:26,559
I'm not gonna let
that happen again.

885
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:30,007
I can find him. I promise I'll find him.
I promise.

886
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:31,887
I will.

887
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:40,371
Turn around.

888
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,530
It's okay!

889
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:55,887
Be careful.

890
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,200
I love you.

891
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:41,206
<i>Destroy her, Josh!
End this!</i>

892
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:47,724
<i>Where am I?</i>

893
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:16,246
Let her go!

894
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:17,361
Lorraine?

895
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,759
Where is he?
He...

896
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:24,841
He's got Renai.

897
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:35,761
What the hell!

898
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:14,723
<i>Parker, help me destroy
the memories of her.</i>

899
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:16,799
<i>It will set you free.</i>

900
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,041
<i>Please let me in.</i>

901
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:21,004
<i>Open the door.</i>

902
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:43,163
<i>Little girls need
to learn to be good!</i>

903
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:04,970
No!

904
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:25,801
Baby!

905
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:27,481
Hey!

906
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,410
Hey, come back!
Come back!

907
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:34,959
<i>Elise!</i>

908
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:36,399
<i>Josh, go now.</i>

909
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:37,879
<i>I wish I could
take you with me.</i>

910
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:39,719
<i>I can't.
But you can take Carl.</i>

911
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:40,767
<i>What?</i>

912
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,719
<i>I told you,
you don't belong here.</i>

913
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:44,519
<i>I felt your heartbeat
when I hugged you.</i>

914
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:47,159
<i>You're still alive.
It's time to live again.</i>

915
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:48,764
<i>But you both have to go now!</i>

916
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,359
<i>Go now!</i>

917
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:53,044
<i>Go!</i>

918
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:20,559
<i>Get away!</i>

919
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,721
<i>Get back! Get back!</i>

920
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,170
<i>Daddy!</i>

921
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,444
<i>Dalton?</i>

922
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:34,919
<i>Dalton!</i>

923
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,046
<i>Daddy!</i>

924
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,119
<i>Where are you, son?</i>

925
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:40,531
<i>Daddy!</i>

926
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:42,407
<i>Oh!</i>

927
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:45,719
<i>Oh, good boy!
What are you doing here?</i>

928
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:47,961
<i>I came to bring you home!</i>

929
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:50,121
<i>How did you find me?</i>

930
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:51,999
<i>I followed your steps.</i>

931
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,002
<i>Please wake up!</i>

932
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:57,202
Where are you?
Come back, come on!

933
01:36:58,360 --> 01:36:59,599
<i>Come back to me.</i>

934
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:00,839
<i>That's Mommy.</i>

935
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:02,649
<i>Wake up!</i>

936
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:05,250
<i>Get back to me!</i>

937
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:08,088
<i>Clever boy.
Follow me.</i>

938
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:11,559
Wake up.

939
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:13,759
Come on, wake up!

940
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:42,566
It's me.

941
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,728
Renai, it's me, it's okay.

942
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:47,971
It's okay.

943
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:49,964
Daddy?

944
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:51,527
Yeah.

945
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,559
Daddy, you're back!

946
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:54,607
Yeah.

947
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:57,130
Thanks to you.

948
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:01,969
My boys. Hey, buddy.

949
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,888
Renai, it's me, it's okay.

950
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:15,967
I tried reaching you. I tried everything.

951
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,325
I played your song.

952
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:31,482
I should've known it was you.

953
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,371
Only you could
play it that badly.

954
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:54,650
Bring it!

955
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:04,846
Are you ready?

956
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:06,844
We're ready.

957
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:10,559
Ready to forget
once and for all.

958
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,528
No more traveling, right?

959
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:16,159
This is the only
world we wanna be in.

960
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:18,039
Good, Mr. Lambert.

961
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:20,771
So then, close your eyes.

962
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:23,921
Both of you.

963
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:27,128
Now take a deep breath,

964
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:30,599
and just listen to the ticking.

965
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:35,039
Now feel yourselves getting
sleepier and sleepier,

966
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:39,679
and let the darkness
drift further

967
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:42,843
and further away.

968
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:13,959
Who is it? I
have a message for you.

969
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:15,405
It's about Allison.

970
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:21,239
Is this some kind of joke?

971
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:24,519
We have a close personal
friend who has, uh,

972
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,284
spoken with Allison.

973
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:27,519
That's not possible.

974
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,439
You better leave now
or I'm calling the police.

975
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,283
Wait, Brian.

976
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:34,119
Who are you guys?

977
01:40:34,120 --> 01:40:36,691
Uh... We help
people, ma'am.

978
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:41,129
People who've been afflicted by...
Who's the lady?

979
01:40:43,080 --> 01:40:44,525
What lady, honey?

980
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:46,130
The lady standing behind them.

981
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,001
Um...

982
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:55,039
Our friend told us to tell you

983
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,599
that Allison's
accident was no accident.

984
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:01,359
When she was resuscitated
back to life at the hospital,

985
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:02,964
she brought something
back with her.

986
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:05,479
Not just one
thing, many things.

987
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:08,324
And they're living here
in this house with you.

988
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:12,364
Allison.

989
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,323
Allison.

990
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:41,641
Oh, my God!

991
01:41:42,305 --> 01:41:48,312
