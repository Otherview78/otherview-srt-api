1
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:31,718
I'm going downstairs. - Who stole my hair dryer?

2
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:35,388
Miss. Young lady. Excuse me. Girls.

3
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:38,558
Hey, hey, little boy.

4
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:41,370
- Excuse me, girls. Girls. - Take the witches!

5
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:44,089
Hey. Hey, big fella. Hey, ma'am! Excuse me.

6
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,633
Come help me make up these beds in the living room! Excuse me. Come on down here. - Ma'am!

7
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:49,110
- Hi. Hey, son! Son! - Who stole my book bag?

8
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:52,739
Big fella! Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Little guy. Little guy!

9
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:57,202
Pete's brother and his family are here. Oh, it's crazy.

10
00:01:57,285 --> 00:02:01,706
- Trish is going to Montreal. - Montreal? That's right. Her family's there.

11
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,708
- And we're off. - When do you leave?

12
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,147
- Tomorrow. - You're not ready, are you?

13
00:02:06,574 --> 00:02:11,074
Mom! Uncle Frank won't let me watch the movie, but the big kids can.

14
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:13,801
- Why can't I? - Kevin, I'm on the phone.

15
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,054
When do you come back? Not till then?

16
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:20,787
It's not even rated "R." He's just being a jerk.

17
00:02:20,847 --> 00:02:25,359
Kevin, if Uncle Frank says no... then it must be really bad.

18
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:27,655
No, we're not bringing the dog. We're putting him...

19
00:02:27,656 --> 00:02:30,261
Hey, hey, hey! Get off. Kevin, out of the room.

20
00:02:30,262 --> 00:02:32,912
Hang up the phone and make me, why don't ya?

21
00:02:33,032 --> 00:02:36,755
Oh, this kid. Kate, did you by any chance pick up a voltage adapter thing?

22
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:40,460
No, I didn't have time to do that. - How am I supposed to shave in France?

23
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:43,839
Grow a @goatee. - Dad, nobody'll let me do anything.

24
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,002
I've got something for you to do. Pick up those Micro Machines that are all over in there.

25
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:50,522
Aunt Leslie stepped on one and almost broke her neck.

26
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:53,053
He was in the garage again playing with the glue gun.

27
00:02:53,054 --> 00:02:54,514
Didn't we talk about that?

28
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:57,806
Did I burn down the @joint? I don't think so.

29
00:02:57,807 --> 00:03:00,352
I was making ornaments out of fishhooks.

30
00:03:00,478 --> 00:03:01,758
My new fishhooks?

31
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,599
I can't make ornaments out of the old ones, with dry worm guts stuck on 'em.

32
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:10,438
- Peter. - Come on, Kevin. Out.

33
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,901
Peter, Kate, do you guys have a voltage adapter?

34
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:18,366
- Here! Here's a voltage adapter. - Oh, you're getting heavy. Go pack your suitcase.

35
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,620
Pack my suitcase?

36
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:25,265
- Do you know where the shampoo is, Fuller? - I don't live here.

37
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:27,833
I don't believe in the house with this many people, there's no shampoo?

38
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,115
- Pardon me, are your parents home? - Yeah, but they don't live here.

39
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:33,044
- Tracy, did you order the pizza? - Buzz did.

40
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:36,758
Excuse me, miss. Are your parents here? - My parents live in Paris. Sorry.

41
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,178
Hi! - Hi!

42
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:39,790
Are your parents home? - Yeah.

43
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,757
Do they live here? - No.

44
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:47,461
No. Why should they? All kids, no parents. Probably a fancy orphanage.

45
00:03:47,462 --> 00:03:51,254
I don't know how to pack a suitcase. I've never done this once in my whole life.

46
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:53,727
- Tough. - That's what Megan said.

47
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,237
- What did I say? - You told Kevin, "tough."

48
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:58,488
The @dope was whining about a suitcase.

49
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:01,659
What am I supposed to do? Shake his hand and say, "Congratulations, you're an idiot"?

50
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:05,022
- I'm not an idiot! - Oh, really? You're completely helpless!

51
00:04:05,023 --> 00:04:07,820
- Everyone has to do everything for you. - She's right, Kev.

52
00:04:07,821 --> 00:04:12,165
Excuse me, puke-breath. I'm a lot smaller than you. I don't know how to pack a suitcase.

53
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,749
- I hope you didn't just pack crap, Jeff. - Shut up, Linnie.

54
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,553
Do you know what I should pack? Buzz told you, @cheek-face. Toilet paper and water.

55
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:23,951
Listen, Kev, what are you so worried about?

56
00:04:23,952 --> 00:04:26,434
You know mom's gonna pack your stuff anyway.

57
00:04:26,714 --> 00:04:29,817
You're what the French call les incompetents.

58
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:33,858
- What? - Bombs away!

59
00:04:38,187 --> 00:04:41,908
P.S. You have to sleep on the @hide-a-bed with Fuller.

60
00:04:42,246 --> 00:04:44,789
If he has something to drink, he's gonna wet the bed.

61
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,843
This house is so full of people, it makes me sick!

62
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:51,875
When I grow up and get married, I'm livin' alone!

63
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:55,594
Did you hear me? I'm livin' alone!

64
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,722
I'm livin' alone!

65
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:02,386
Who's gonna feed your spider while we're gone?

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,379
He just ate a whole load of mice guts. He should be good for a couple weeks.

67
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:11,600
Is it true that French babes don't shave their pits?

68
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:14,080
Some don't.

69
00:05:14,736 --> 00:05:16,575
But they got nude beaches.

70
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:18,307
Not in the winter.

71
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:27,745
- Buzz? - Don't you know how to knock, @phlegm-wad?

72
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:31,841
Can I sleep in your room? I don't want to sleep on hide-a-bed with Fuller.

73
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:34,058
If he has something to drink, he'll wet the bed.

74
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:38,821
I wouldn't let you sleep in my room if you were growing on my ass.

75
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:44,169
Check it out. Old man Marley.

76
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:49,327
Who is he?

77
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:53,104
You ever heard of the South Bend Shovel Slayer!

78
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:55,148
- No. - That's him.

79
00:05:55,231 --> 00:06:00,766
Back in '58, he murdered his whole family and half the people on his block...

80
00:06:01,321 --> 00:06:03,448
with a snow shovel.

81
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:06,868
Been hiding out in this neighborhood ever since.

82
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:10,455
Well, if he's the Shovel Slayer, how come the cops don't arrest him?

83
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,498
Not enough evidence to convict.

84
00:06:13,044 --> 00:06:15,250
They never found the bodies.

85
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,138
But everyone around here knows he did it.

86
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:22,507
Now it'll just be a matter of time before he does it again.

87
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:27,430
What's he doin' now? He walks up and down the streets every night...

88
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:29,849
salting the @sidewalks.

89
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:32,410
Maybe he's just trying to be nice.

90
00:06:33,603 --> 00:06:35,855
No way.

91
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,983
See that garbage can full of salt?

92
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:42,070
That's where he keeps his victims.

93
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:45,073
The salt turns the bodies...

94
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:47,992
into mummies.

95
00:06:48,078 --> 00:06:51,037
- Mummies.

96
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,418
Look out!

97
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,610
...

98
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,995
How you kids doin', huh? Good?

99
00:07:32,476 --> 00:07:34,876
Lot of action around here today, huh?

100
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:38,660
Goin' on vacation? Where you goin'?

101
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:42,005
Do you hear me or what? Goin' on a trip?

102
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:44,064
Where you goin', kid?

103
00:07:53,861 --> 00:07:56,602
Okay, that's 122.50.

104
00:07:56,957 --> 00:07:58,770
Not for me, kid. I don't live here.

105
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:02,774
Oh. You just around for the holidays? - I guess you could say that.

106
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:06,486
Hey, pizza's here! - Here you go. That's 122.50.

107
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:09,084
It's my brother's house. He'll take care of it.

108
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:12,554
Hey, listen, uh...

109
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:14,680
Hi. - Hi.

110
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:16,871
Are you Mr. McCallister? - Yeah.

111
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,034
The Mr. McCallister who lives here? - Yes.

112
00:08:19,035 --> 00:08:21,464
Oh, good, 'cause somebody owes me 122.50.

113
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,502
- I'd like a word with you, sir. - Am I under arrest or something?

114
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:29,073
No, no. It's Christmastime. There's always a lot of burglaries around the holidays.

115
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:33,767
So we're just checking the neighborhood to see if everyone's taking the proper precautions.

116
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:37,989
Oh, yeah. Well, we have automatic timers for our lights, locks for our doors.

117
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,974
That's about as well as anybody can do these days. Right?

118
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:42,387
- You get some eggnog? - Come on, Dad.

119
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,025
- Let's eat. - Come on.

120
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:48,373
- Eggnog? Listen, are you gonna be leaving, uh... - Pizza! Pizza!

121
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:51,860
Grab yourself a napkin. You're gonna have to pour your own drinks.

122
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:54,576
Mam, does Santa Claus have to go through @customs?

123
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:56,555
What time do we have to go to bed?

124
00:08:56,556 --> 00:08:59,658
Early. We're leaving the house at 8:00 a.m. @on the button.

125
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:03,501
I hope you're all drinking milk. I want to get rid of it. Hey! Don't you dare.

126
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:08,453
Honey, the pizza boy needs $122.50, plus a tip. - For pizza?

127
00:09:08,454 --> 00:09:10,293
Ten pizzas times 12 bucks.

128
00:09:10,294 --> 00:09:13,040
- Frank, you've got money. Come on. - Traveler's checks.

129
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,221
Forget it, Frank. We have cash.

130
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:18,732
You've probably got traveler's checks that don't work in France.

131
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:21,520
Did anyone order me a plain cheese?

132
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,064
Oh, yeah, we did. But if you want any...

133
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:27,877
somebody's gonna have to @barf it all up, 'cause it's gone.

134
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:31,439
Fuller! Go easy on the Pepsi.

135
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:41,124
Kev! Kevin, get a plate.

136
00:09:50,175 --> 00:09:52,969
The passports! Watch it!

137
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,532
Help me out here!

138
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:59,100
Let's get these passports out of here.

139
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:02,687
- Kevin, get off of him! - You moron!

140
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:06,357
Are you okay, honey? Come here. Are you all right?

141
00:10:07,109 --> 00:10:08,845
What is the matter with you?

142
00:10:08,871 --> 00:10:11,237
He started it! He ate my pizza on purpose.

143
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,739
He knows I hate sausage and olives and...

144
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,159
Look what you did, you little jerk!

145
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:32,253
- Kevin, get upstairs right now. - Why?

146
00:10:32,425 --> 00:10:35,562
- Kevin, you're such a disease. - Shut up.

147
00:10:35,563 --> 00:10:38,054
- Kevin, upstairs! - Say good night, Kevin.

148
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:40,329
- Good night, Kevin. - Now what's for dinner?

149
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:44,352
Why do I always get treated like scum?

150
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:47,266
Oh, I'm sorry. This house is just crazy.

151
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:48,845
We've got all these extra kids running around.

152
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:52,937
My brother-in-law drove in from Ohio today. It's just nuts.

153
00:10:52,938 --> 00:10:55,198
How @come you didn't bring more cheese pizzas?

154
00:10:56,318 --> 00:10:58,741
Nice tip. Thanks a lot. - Thanks.

155
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,252
Having a reunion or something?

156
00:11:00,253 --> 00:11:02,815
Oh, no. My husband's brother transferred to Paris last summer...

157
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:05,741
and his kids are still going to school here, and I guess he missed the whole family.

158
00:11:05,742 --> 00:11:08,710
He's giving us this trip to Paris so we can be together.

159
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:12,465
- You're taking a trip to Paris? - Yes, we hope to leave tomorrow morning.

160
00:11:13,595 --> 00:11:15,285
Excellent. Excellent.

161
00:11:15,286 --> 00:11:18,430
If you'll excuse me, @this one's out of sorts. I'll be right back.

162
00:11:18,437 --> 00:11:21,589
Don't worry about me. I spoke to your husband already.

163
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:25,812
And don't worry about your home. It's in good hands.

164
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:32,552
There are 15 people in this house. You're the only one that has to make trouble.

165
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:35,547
I'm the only one getting @dumped on. - You're the only one acting up.

166
00:11:35,548 --> 00:11:40,034
Now get upstairs. - I am upstairs, dummy.

167
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,994
- The third floor? - Go.

168
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:46,483
- It's scary up there. - Don't be silly. Fuller will be up in a little while.

169
00:11:46,484 --> 00:11:49,646
I don't want to sleep with Fuller. You know about him. He wets the bed.

170
00:11:49,647 --> 00:11:51,629
He'll pee all over me. I know it.

171
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:54,114
Fine. We'll put him somewhere else.

172
00:11:55,244 --> 00:11:56,504
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:56,888 --> 00:11:59,159
It's too late. Get upstairs.

174
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,183
Everyone in this family hates me.

175
00:12:04,313 --> 00:12:06,518
Then maybe you should ask Santa for a new family.

176
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:10,314
I don't want a new family! I don't want any family! Families suck!

177
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:13,885
Stay up there. I don't want to see you for the rest of the night.

178
00:12:13,886 --> 00:12:16,704
I don't want to see you for the rest of my life.

179
00:12:16,705 --> 00:12:19,032
And I don't want to see anybody else either.

180
00:12:19,157 --> 00:12:21,117
I hope you don't mean that.

181
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:25,163
You'd feel pretty sad if you woke up tomorrow morning and you didn't have a family.

182
00:12:25,851 --> 00:12:29,165
- No, I wouldn't. - Then say it again.

183
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:33,296
- Maybe it'll happen. - I hope I never see any of you jerks again.

184
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,445
I wish they would all just disappear.

185
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,746
...

186
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,542
...

187
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:57,630
- Where are they? - I don't know. She said 8:00 @sharp.

188
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:07,693
Peter!

189
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,519
We @slept in!

190
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:31,289
Hi. I'm Mitch Murphy. I live across the street.

191
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:35,136
You guys going out of town? We're going to Orlando, Florida.

192
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:38,588
Well, actually, first we're going to Missouri to pick up my grandma.

193
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:41,257
Do you know the McCallisters are going to France?

194
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:45,567
Do you know if it's cold there? Do these vans get good gas mileage?

195
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:47,780
Gee, kid, I don't know. Hit the road.

196
00:14:51,536 --> 00:14:55,312
Heather, do a head count. Make sure everyone's in the vans. Where are the passports and tickets?

197
00:14:55,313 --> 00:14:57,314
I put 'em in the microwave to dry 'em off.

198
00:14:57,315 --> 00:15:01,526
How fast does this thing go? Does it have automatic transmission?

199
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:03,362
Does it have four-wheel drive?

200
00:15:03,363 --> 00:15:07,534
Look, I told you before, kid, don't bother me. Now beat it.

201
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:17,253
Come on. Hurry up.

202
00:15:18,871 --> 00:15:22,775
- Line up in front off the van. - Did you take my batteries?

203
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:25,009
- Line up and shut up!

204
00:15:25,093 --> 00:15:27,886
Shut up. - I gotta take a head count.

205
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:32,752
- One, two, three, four, five... - Eleven, 92, 12.

206
00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:34,867
Buzz, don't be a moron.

207
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:37,896
Six, seven, eight...

208
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:40,903
nine, 10, 11.

209
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:44,485
Okay. Half in this van, half in this van. Come on. Let's go.

210
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:48,491
Have a good trip. Bring me back something French.

211
00:15:51,244 --> 00:15:55,379
There's no way on earth we're gonna make this plane. It leaves in 45 minutes.

212
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,585
- Think positive, Frank. - You be positive. I'll be realistic.

213
00:15:58,586 --> 00:16:02,672
- Ma'am? Ma'am? I wanted to let you know your power's fixed.

214
00:16:02,673 --> 00:16:06,383
But Phone lines are a mess. Gonna take Ma Bell a couple of days to patch 'em up.

215
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:08,803
- Especially around the holidays. - Okay, thanks.

216
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,725
- Heather! Did you count heads? - Eleven, including me.

217
00:16:12,726 --> 00:16:17,145
Five boys, six girls, four parents, two drivers and a partridge in a pear tree.

218
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:51,970
This way!

219
00:16:53,081 --> 00:16:58,102
- Hold the plane! - Did we miss the flight? No, you just made it.

220
00:16:58,228 --> 00:17:02,315
- Single seats only @in coach. Take whatever's free. - Thank you.

221
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,609
I get a window seat!

222
00:17:07,223 --> 00:17:08,818
You kids are in coach. We're up here.

223
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,606
Here are your seats. Five "A"and "B" and four "A"and "B."

224
00:17:11,607 --> 00:17:14,993
I'll take your coats. - Thank you.

225
00:17:14,994 --> 00:17:16,682
Fasten your seat belts, please.

226
00:17:16,683 --> 00:17:19,838
- Champagne, please. It's free, isn't it? - Oh, yes.

227
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:25,547
- We made it. - Do you believe it? Hope we didn't forget anything.

228
00:18:12,084 --> 00:18:13,515
What are you doing out of costume?

229
00:18:13,516 --> 00:18:15,049
Now get back and get dressed.

230
00:18:15,054 --> 00:18:17,726
I'm terribly sorry. I thought you were our Santa Claus.

231
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,578
Your Santa Claus is intoxicated.

232
00:18:20,512 --> 00:18:21,820
- Oh, no. - Yes.

233
00:18:21,821 --> 00:18:24,522
It's disgraceful! How can you allow a man...

234
00:18:30,037 --> 00:18:32,790
What do you mean by drinking? You know it's not allowed!

235
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:36,451
But it's cold. A man's gotta do something to keep warm.

236
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:38,577
I ought to take this cane and...

237
00:18:38,578 --> 00:18:43,166
Julia, get some black coffee and plenty of it.

238
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:45,210
Black with a little cream.

239
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:47,576
Mom?

240
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:54,467
Thank you.

241
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:58,556
That's real crystal. It's real. - Yeah. So?

242
00:18:58,607 --> 00:19:02,009
Put 'em in your purse. Put 'em! Put 'em! - I can't do that.

243
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,864
Put them in your purse!

244
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:09,150
Uh, yeah, yeah, fill it up, fill it up. Fill it up, please.

245
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:11,152
Thank you.

246
00:19:11,277 --> 00:19:14,780
Don't you feel like a @heel flying first class with the kids back in coach?

247
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:16,658
No, the kids are fine.

248
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:20,788
Only flying I ever did as a kid was in the family @station wagon, and it wasn't to France.

249
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:24,332
We used to have to go over to Aunt Laura and Uncle Arthur's house.

250
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:27,318
The kids are okay. They're @having the time of their lives. - Yeah.

251
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:30,380
Hello?

252
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:33,508
Mom?

253
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:37,262
Dad?

254
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,393
Mom? Dad?

255
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:48,147
Where are you guys?

256
00:19:48,273 --> 00:19:50,233
Buzz?

257
00:19:51,651 --> 00:19:53,611
Buzz?

258
00:19:56,614 --> 00:19:58,575
Buzz?

259
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:04,329
Megan?

260
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:08,877
Hello? Hello?

261
00:20:09,002 --> 00:20:11,963
Rod? Uncle Frank?

262
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:14,382
Uncle Frank, is this a joke?

263
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:19,179
Megan? Linnie?

264
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:23,766
Is this a joke?

265
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:51,461
It's only my imagination. Only my imagination.

266
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:12,065
The cars are still here. They didn't go to the airport.

267
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:33,753
I made my family disappear.

268
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:37,048
Kevin, you're completely helpless.

269
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:41,719
You know, Kevin, you're what the French call les incompetents.

270
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:45,056
Kevin, I'm going to feed you to my tarantula.

271
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:48,142
Kevin, you are such a disease.

272
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:53,356
There are 15 people in this house... and you're the only one who has to make trouble.

273
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:56,776
Look what you did, you little jerk.

274
00:22:00,613 --> 00:22:03,741
I made my family disappear.

275
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:22,135
I'm free! Free! Free!

276
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:43,698
No clothes on anybody. Sickening!

277
00:22:44,372 --> 00:22:48,076
Cool! @Firecrackers! I'll save these for later.

278
00:22:48,077 --> 00:22:51,510
Buzz, I'm going through all your private stuff!

279
00:22:51,511 --> 00:22:54,083
You better come out and pound me!

280
00:22:57,985 --> 00:23:00,819
Buzz, your girlfriend! Woof!

281
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:40,045
...

282
00:23:49,744 --> 00:23:51,704
Who is it?

283
00:23:55,053 --> 00:23:57,896
It's me, Snakes. I got the stuff.

284
00:23:57,897 --> 00:24:01,025
Leave it on the doorstep and get the hell out of here.

285
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:04,320
All right, Johnny. But what about my money?

286
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:07,949
- What money? - Acey said you had some @dough for me.

287
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:11,159
Is that a fact? How much do I owe you?

288
00:24:11,374 --> 00:24:13,855
Acey said 10%.

289
00:24:14,408 --> 00:24:16,791
Too bad Acey ain't in charge no more.

290
00:24:17,185 --> 00:24:20,401
- What do you mean? - Guys, I'm eating junk and watching rubbish!

291
00:24:20,402 --> 00:24:22,881
You better come out and stop me!

292
00:24:22,964 --> 00:24:25,592
He'll call you when he gets out.

293
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:31,173
Hey. I tell you what I'm gonna give you, Snakes.

294
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,615
I'm gonna give you to the count of 10...

295
00:24:34,902 --> 00:24:37,353
to get your ugly, yellow...

296
00:24:37,437 --> 00:24:39,564
@no-good keister off my property...

297
00:24:39,765 --> 00:24:42,091
before I pump your guts full of lead.

298
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:44,568
All right, Johnny, I'm sorry. I'm goin'.

299
00:24:44,935 --> 00:24:46,736
One, two, ten!

300
00:25:02,597 --> 00:25:05,016
Keep the change, ya filthy animal.

301
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:08,009
Mom!

302
00:25:19,354 --> 00:25:21,940
What's the matter?

303
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:24,442
Honey?

304
00:25:24,526 --> 00:25:28,071
- I have a terrible feeling. - About what?

305
00:25:29,155 --> 00:25:31,282
That we didn't do something.

306
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:34,702
Oh, no, you feel that way because we left in such a hurry.

307
00:25:34,827 --> 00:25:38,189
We took care of everything. Believe me, we did. - Did I turn off the coffee?

308
00:25:38,657 --> 00:25:41,208
No. I did.

309
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:43,211
Did you lock up?

310
00:25:43,872 --> 00:25:45,337
Yeah.

311
00:25:46,691 --> 00:25:48,165
Did you close the garage?

312
00:25:50,009 --> 00:25:53,805
That's it. I forgot to close the garage. That's it.

313
00:25:59,394 --> 00:26:01,542
No, that's not it.

314
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,441
What else could we be forgetting?

315
00:26:09,028 --> 00:26:10,532
Kevin!

316
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:56,868
The captain's doing all he can. Your phones are still out of order.

317
00:26:56,993 --> 00:27:01,103
We'll call as soon as we land, Kate. I'm sure everything's okay.

318
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:05,126
It's horrible. Horrible. Just horrible.

319
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:08,296
How could we do this? We forgot him.

320
00:27:08,421 --> 00:27:11,224
We didn't forget him. We just... miscounted.

321
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:14,052
What kind of mother am I?

322
00:27:14,364 --> 00:27:18,076
If it makes you feel any better, I forgot my reading glasses.

323
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:25,354
Five families gone on one block alone.

324
00:27:25,585 --> 00:27:30,400
- They all told me from their own mouths. It's almost too easy.

325
00:27:30,808 --> 00:27:34,363
Check it out. All the houses with nobody home...

326
00:27:34,364 --> 00:27:37,492
have automatic timers on their lights.

327
00:27:37,617 --> 00:27:40,453
But I got it all figured out. Watch this.

328
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:49,318
Number 664 will be going on... right about... now.

329
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:53,591
- Oh. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

330
00:27:53,716 --> 00:27:56,261
Number 672...

331
00:27:57,554 --> 00:28:00,020
right... now.

332
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:03,518
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

333
00:28:03,643 --> 00:28:07,856
671... now.

334
00:28:10,579 --> 00:28:15,852
And that's the one, Marvin. That's the silver tuna. - Oh, it's very@ "G."

335
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,616
Very "G, " huh? It's loaded.

336
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,722
It's got lots of topflight goods.

337
00:28:21,723 --> 00:28:24,664
- Stereos, VCR's. - Toys.

338
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:29,753
Probably lookin' at some very fine jewelry. - Possible cash hoard.

339
00:28:29,754 --> 00:28:35,884
Odd @marketable securities. Who knows? It's a gem.

340
00:28:36,309 --> 00:28:38,269
Grab your crowbar.

341
00:28:39,193 --> 00:28:41,154
Crowbars up.

342
00:29:40,156 --> 00:29:44,693
Which way? - We'll go around back to the basement. Follow me.

343
00:30:04,966 --> 00:30:06,513
I thought you said they were gone.

344
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:10,103
They were supposed to leave this morning. - Let's get out of here.

345
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:48,187
We have to use the phone, please.

346
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:51,427
I'm sorry. It's an emergency. We really have to make a call.

347
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,505
Please! Our brother's home alone.

348
00:30:55,315 --> 00:30:58,994
- Give us the phone! - Thank you. I'm sorry. Thank you.

349
00:30:59,114 --> 00:31:01,613
Peter, I'm gonna call the police. Why don't you book us a flight home.

350
00:31:01,738 --> 00:31:06,367
Here, get some change out of here. Call everybody you know. Oh. Leslie.

351
00:31:06,492 --> 00:31:09,614
Here's my address book. You and Frank call everybody who lives on our street.

352
00:31:09,615 --> 00:31:13,167
Maybe somebody can help us. Hello? Hello? Hello?

353
00:31:13,168 --> 00:31:15,490
She'll have to call you back.

354
00:31:21,007 --> 00:31:24,928
This is ridiculous. Only a wimp would be hiding under a bed.

355
00:31:25,144 --> 00:31:29,017
And I can't be a wimp. I'm the man of the house.

356
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:39,538
Hey! I'm not afraid anymore!

357
00:31:40,777 --> 00:31:44,739
I said, I'm not afraid anymore!

358
00:31:44,997 --> 00:31:47,833
Do you hear me? I'm not afraid anymore!

359
00:32:19,483 --> 00:32:21,162
Village Police Department.

360
00:32:21,163 --> 00:32:24,620
Hi. Look, I'm calling from Paris. I have a son who's home alone.

361
00:32:24,621 --> 00:32:28,113
Our phones are out of order, so I'd like somebody to go to our house...

362
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:29,921
and tell him we're coming home to get him.

363
00:32:29,974 --> 00:32:31,953
Let me connect you with Family Crisis Intervention.

364
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:34,914
- It's not a family crisis. - Hold on.

365
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:40,295
Larry, can you pick up? There's some lady on hold, sounds kind of @hyper.

366
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,131
- What line, Rose? - Uh, two.

367
00:32:43,443 --> 00:32:45,924
Family Crisis Intervention. Sergeant Balzak.

368
00:32:46,385 --> 00:32:49,052
I am calling from Paris. I have a son who's home alone.

369
00:32:49,053 --> 00:32:51,291
Has the child been involved in a violent @altercation...

370
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:54,120
with a drunken and/or mentally ill member of his immediate family?

371
00:32:54,513 --> 00:32:58,144
- No. - Has he been involved in a household accident?

372
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,953
I don't know. I don't... I hope not.

373
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:05,782
Has the child ingested any poison... and/or any other object that has become @lodged in his throat?

374
00:33:05,855 --> 00:33:09,620
No, he's just home alone! I would like somebody to go over to the house...

375
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:12,285
and see that he's all right, just to check on him.

376
00:33:12,535 --> 00:33:16,141
You want us to go to your house just to check on him?

377
00:33:16,374 --> 00:33:19,839
Yes! - Let me connect you with the police department.

378
00:33:19,886 --> 00:33:22,218
No. They just transferred me to you. - Rose?

379
00:33:22,219 --> 00:33:24,941
Yeah? - Hyper on two. Hold on, please.

380
00:33:24,942 --> 00:33:29,884
No, please don't hang up. Please, don't... Any luck?

381
00:33:29,885 --> 00:33:34,304
No. We couldn't get anybody. - Leslie?

382
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:36,610
I'm sorry, Kate. Nothing but a bunch of answering machines.

383
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:44,061
Somebody pick up. Pick up! - Hi, ma'am. It's you again.

384
00:33:44,062 --> 00:33:48,527
Yeah, hi. Look. I'm calling from Paris. I have a son who's home alone, and I...

385
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:51,908
Okay, okay. We'll send a policeman over to your house to check on your son.

386
00:34:22,146 --> 00:34:24,816
There's no one home. The house looks secure.

387
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:27,986
- Tell 'em to count their kids again. - Ten-four.

388
00:34:28,111 --> 00:34:31,088
I can't believe you can't bump somebody or ask somebody...

389
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:33,023
I'm sorry, but there's no way I can do that.

390
00:34:33,024 --> 00:34:35,240
Isn't there a way like if you ask somebody?

391
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:38,203
I mean, if you brought somebody up here and you explained to them that this is an emergency... - I wish I could...

392
00:34:38,204 --> 00:34:40,724
They're sending a policeman over to the house to check on Kevin.

393
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:45,356
- That's a relief. Everything here is booked. - There's nothing to Chicago?

394
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:49,618
There's nothing to Chicago, New York, Nashville. You name it. Everything's gone.

395
00:34:50,027 --> 00:34:53,052
- What about a private plane? - No, I'm sorry. We don't do that.

396
00:34:53,434 --> 00:34:56,437
The only thing they have is a booking for all of us on Friday morning.

397
00:34:56,438 --> 00:34:59,148
Friday morning? That's two days away.

398
00:34:59,149 --> 00:35:01,456
Look, honey, the kids are exhausted. You are exhausted.

399
00:35:01,457 --> 00:35:03,593
There's absolutely nothing more we can do in this airport.

400
00:35:03,594 --> 00:35:07,918
Now I say we go to Rob's, we can call the police, and they can get back to us.

401
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:11,987
Peter, Kevin is home all by himself. I'm not leaving here unless it's on an airplane.

402
00:35:11,988 --> 00:35:13,907
Madame, we are doing everything we can.

403
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:18,319
If you want to stay at the airport, maybe we can get you on a standby.

404
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,095
It is a possibility that a seat will open up.

405
00:35:21,581 --> 00:35:24,667
- Is that okay? - Yes. I'll wait.

406
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:33,384
- Bye. I'll miss you. - Bye.

407
00:35:33,468 --> 00:35:36,429
- Find Kevin.

408
00:35:36,554 --> 00:35:38,515
Don't you get lost.

409
00:35:38,598 --> 00:35:42,769
Good-bye. Good-bye, Kate.

410
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:00,244
I took a shower, washing every body part with actual soap...

411
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:04,749
including all my major @crevices, including in between my toes and in my belly button...

412
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:07,293
which I never did before, but sort of enjoyed.

413
00:36:07,484 --> 00:36:12,647
I washed my hair with adult-formula shampoo... and used cream rinse for that just-washed shine.

414
00:36:14,107 --> 00:36:17,603
I can't seem to find my toothbrush, so I'll pick one up when I go out today.

415
00:36:17,604 --> 00:36:19,648
Other than that, I'm in good shape.

416
00:37:10,178 --> 00:37:13,116
All right! Buzz's life savings.

417
00:37:40,529 --> 00:37:42,923
I thought the Murphys went to Florida.

418
00:37:59,416 --> 00:38:02,450
You know, you're one of the great cat burglars of the world, Marv.

419
00:38:02,575 --> 00:38:05,107
You think you could keep it down a little in there?

420
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:10,177
Hi, you've reached the Murphys. Please leave a message after you hear the beep.

421
00:38:10,577 --> 00:38:14,921
Chuck, this is Peter McCallister again, and we're still in Paris at my brother's apartment.

422
00:38:14,922 --> 00:38:18,132
Let me give you the number here, okay? The country code is 3-3.

423
00:38:18,258 --> 00:38:23,671
The area code is 1-4. And the number is 694-8764.

424
00:38:23,672 --> 00:38:25,785
Hey, Harry? - Yeah?

425
00:38:25,786 --> 00:38:28,585
House we were at last night, was that the McCallisters?

426
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:31,366
Yeah. - Call me in Paris.

427
00:38:31,367 --> 00:38:33,773
You're right. They're gone.

428
00:38:37,193 --> 00:38:40,400
- I knew they were. - Silver tuna tonight.

429
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,373
How may I help you?

430
00:38:51,885 --> 00:38:55,294
Is this toothbrush approved by the American Dental Association?

431
00:38:55,527 --> 00:38:58,213
Well, I don't know.

432
00:38:58,214 --> 00:39:02,390
- It doesn't say, hon. - Can you please find out?

433
00:39:04,971 --> 00:39:07,221
- Herb! - Yeah?

434
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:10,894
I've got a question here about a toothbrush.

435
00:39:17,075 --> 00:39:18,940
Do you know, is this toothbrush approved

436
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:23,013
by the American Dental Association? - I don't know.

437
00:39:44,678 --> 00:39:48,014
- Just tell him that... - Oh, hon, you pay for that here.

438
00:39:48,097 --> 00:39:50,016
Why don't you just tell him it's approved?

439
00:39:50,017 --> 00:39:55,794
Wait, son, you have to pay for that toothbrush. Son? Son! Hey!

440
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:59,317
Jimmy! Stop that boy!

441
00:40:02,779 --> 00:40:06,074
Hey! Hey!

442
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,012
@Shoplifter!

443
00:40:13,395 --> 00:40:15,221
Hey! Hey, kid!

444
00:40:15,222 --> 00:40:17,585
Come back here!

445
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,421
Watch it!

446
00:40:21,798 --> 00:40:23,591
Come back here!

447
00:40:23,716 --> 00:40:27,785
Stop it, will ya! Come here!

448
00:41:06,424 --> 00:41:08,385
I'm a criminal.

449
00:41:35,371 --> 00:41:37,097
What's so funny?

450
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:40,835
What's so funny? What are you laughin' at?

451
00:41:44,187 --> 00:41:45,465
You did it again, didn't you?

452
00:41:46,756 --> 00:41:48,218
You left the water runnin', didn't you?

453
00:41:49,342 --> 00:41:51,869
What's wrong with you? I told you not to do it.

454
00:41:52,002 --> 00:41:53,633
Harry, it's our calling card.

455
00:41:53,634 --> 00:41:56,351
- Calling card. - All the great ones leave their mark.

456
00:41:56,828 --> 00:41:58,477
We're the "Wet Bandits."

457
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,724
You're sick, you know that? You're really sick.

458
00:42:02,038 --> 00:42:03,688
- I'm not sick. - Yes, you are.

459
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:05,708
- I'm not sick! - That's a sick thing to do!

460
00:42:12,116 --> 00:42:14,407
We don't need that heat. - Don't tell me what to do.

461
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:16,412
I can do it if I want to.

462
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,412
- You're sick. - I'm not sick.

463
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:20,818
- Hey, watch out!

464
00:42:28,716 --> 00:42:32,619
Hey. Hey! You gotta watch out for traffic, son, you know?

465
00:42:33,046 --> 00:42:34,930
- Sorry. - Damn.

466
00:42:34,931 --> 00:42:37,598
Santy don't visit the funeral homes, little buddy.

467
00:42:38,345 --> 00:42:39,477
Okay, okay.

468
00:42:40,422 --> 00:42:42,364
Merry Christmas.

469
00:42:52,646 --> 00:42:55,937
What's the matter? - I don't like the way that kid looked at me.

470
00:42:55,938 --> 00:42:58,235
Did you see that? - You ever seen him before?

471
00:42:58,236 --> 00:43:00,498
I saw a hundred kids this week.

472
00:43:01,488 --> 00:43:03,393
Let's see what house he goes into.

473
00:43:35,672 --> 00:43:37,358
Why is he goin' faster?

474
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:42,053
I told you something's wrong. I knew he looked at me weird. Why would he run?

475
00:44:17,624 --> 00:44:21,117
Maybe he went in the church. - I'm not goin' in there.

476
00:44:21,118 --> 00:44:24,186
Me neither. - Ah, let's get out of here.

477
00:44:42,954 --> 00:44:45,833
When those guys come back, I'll be ready.

478
00:45:11,296 --> 00:45:13,840
- Did they come back? - From Paris?

479
00:45:50,242 --> 00:45:53,162
We'll come back tomorrow. Maybe they'll be gone by then.

480
00:45:53,364 --> 00:45:56,165
We'd better get out of here before somebody sees us.

481
00:46:26,087 --> 00:46:28,066
Attention! Attention!

482
00:46:28,067 --> 00:46:33,628
- Look what I have found in "ze" kitchen! - Frank, those are for later. Frank?

483
00:46:35,046 --> 00:46:39,007
Mes petites enfants, do you want a little shrimp, eh?

484
00:46:39,008 --> 00:46:42,220
Oper... Do you speak English?

485
00:46:42,345 --> 00:46:45,139
Parlez anglais?

486
00:46:45,265 --> 00:46:47,225
Is there... I mean...

487
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:52,272
Est ce qui un person qui parle anglais?

488
00:46:52,355 --> 00:46:55,400
- Did you get anybody? - I'm looking for my son! Do you know where he is?

489
00:46:55,843 --> 00:46:59,108
I can't find anybody. They've all gone shopping.

490
00:46:59,109 --> 00:47:00,822
Nobody's home for the holidays.

491
00:47:00,947 --> 00:47:03,032
Never mind. Forget it.

492
00:47:03,116 --> 00:47:06,813
This is so pointless. - What?

493
00:47:06,814 --> 00:47:08,997
We're here rotting in this apartment.

494
00:47:09,122 --> 00:47:11,415
Kevin's at home. Mom's at the airport.

495
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:14,679
- So? - You're not at all worried about Kevin?

496
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:19,868
Why should I be? He's acted like a jerk too many times, and this time he @caught it in the butt.

497
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:24,094
But he's so little and helpless. Don't you think he's @flipped out?

498
00:47:24,095 --> 00:47:27,526
The little @trout can use a couple of days in the real world.

499
00:47:27,623 --> 00:47:30,300
You're not worried that something might happen to him?

500
00:47:30,586 --> 00:47:32,812
No. For three reasons.

501
00:47:32,832 --> 00:47:37,808
A: I'm not that lucky. Two: We have smoke detectors.

502
00:47:37,809 --> 00:47:41,798
And "D": We live in the most boring street in the United States of America...

503
00:47:41,799 --> 00:47:45,992
where nothing even remotely dangerous will ever happen, period.

504
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:02,971
...

505
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:16,647
- Who is it? - It's Little Nero's, sir. I have your pizza.

506
00:48:17,234 --> 00:48:20,403
Leave it on the doorstep and get the hell outta here.

507
00:48:20,811 --> 00:48:22,695
Okay.

508
00:48:23,086 --> 00:48:25,255
Um, well, what about the money?

509
00:48:26,299 --> 00:48:27,925
What money?

510
00:48:28,604 --> 00:48:31,453
Well, you have to pay for your pizza, sir.

511
00:48:32,315 --> 00:48:35,959
Is that a fact? How much do I owe you?

512
00:48:36,389 --> 00:48:39,337
Uh, that'll be 11.80, sir.

513
00:48:46,518 --> 00:48:49,528
Keep the change, ya filthy animal.

514
00:48:50,932 --> 00:48:52,851
- @Cheapskate. - Hey.

515
00:48:52,934 --> 00:48:57,265
I'm gonna give you to the count of 10 to get your ugly...

516
00:48:57,266 --> 00:49:00,455
yellow, no-good keister off my property...

517
00:49:00,495 --> 00:49:03,030
before I pump your guts full of lead.

518
00:49:03,077 --> 00:49:05,125
One, two, ten!

519
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,602
A lovely cheese pizza just for me.

520
00:49:39,939 --> 00:49:42,009
To Dallas-Fort Worth.

521
00:49:42,024 --> 00:49:43,775
...

522
00:49:45,528 --> 00:49:48,080
We have the $500, the pocket translator...

523
00:49:48,081 --> 00:49:50,700
the two first-class seats... that's an upgrade from your coach...

524
00:49:50,783 --> 00:49:55,579
- Is that a real Rolex? - Do you think it is?

525
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,620
- No. - But who can tell?

526
00:49:57,621 --> 00:50:01,419
- I also have a ring. - That is beautiful!

527
00:50:01,544 --> 00:50:03,457
Come on, Airin. They're boarding.

528
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:07,192
This gal has offered us two first-class tickets if we go Friday.

529
00:50:07,193 --> 00:50:11,262
Plus a ring, a watch, a pocket translator, $500 and...

530
00:50:11,387 --> 00:50:14,595
The earrings. You love the earrings. - She's got her own earrings.

531
00:50:14,596 --> 00:50:16,993
A whole shoe box full of' em. Dangley ones.

532
00:50:16,994 --> 00:50:18,538
- Come on, come on. - No, but...

533
00:50:20,279 --> 00:50:22,083
I'm desperate.

534
00:50:22,206 --> 00:50:26,569
I'm begging you. From a mother to a mother, please.

535
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,777
- Oh, Ed. - Please.

536
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,555
Oh, all right.

537
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:41,125
"Dear Santa Claus. I got a little sister last year.

538
00:50:41,431 --> 00:50:43,599
This year I'd rather have some clay @dough."

539
00:50:57,517 --> 00:50:59,435
...

540
00:50:58,556 --> 00:50:59,803
I didn't mean it.

541
00:50:59,804 --> 00:51:06,714
If you come back, I'll never be a pain in the butt again. I promise. Good night.

542
00:51:25,988 --> 00:51:29,381

Are those microwave dinners any good?

551
00:52:50,148 --> 00:52:53,485
- I don't know. - I'll give 'em a @whirl.

552
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:00,255
For the kids.

553
00:53:02,275 --> 00:53:04,769
Hold on. I got a coupon for that.

554
00:53:05,781 --> 00:53:08,002
It was in the paper this morning.

555
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:13,824
- 19.83. - Okay.

556
00:53:18,249 --> 00:53:20,268
Are you here all by yourself?

557
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:27,667
Ma'am, I'm eight years old. You think I would be here alone? I don't think so.

558
00:53:27,792 --> 00:53:30,279
- Where's your mom? - My mom's in the car.

559
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,334
- And where is your father? - He's at work.

560
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:35,723
- What about your brothers and your sisters? - I'm an only child.

561
00:53:35,943 --> 00:53:38,388
- Where do you live? - I can't tell you that.

562
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:41,904
- Why not? - 'Cause you're a stranger.

563
00:54:19,505 --> 00:54:23,300
Hello, Kevin!

564
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:28,583
Shut up.

565
00:54:41,226 --> 00:54:42,699
I don't get it.

566
00:54:43,198 --> 00:54:45,494
I mean, right now it looks like there's nobody home.

567
00:54:46,359 --> 00:54:49,164
Last night the place is jumpin'.

568
00:54:49,165 --> 00:54:53,147
Somethin' ain't right. Go check it out.

569
00:55:01,918 --> 00:55:03,512
Now?

570
00:55:03,513 --> 00:55:08,142
No, tomorrow, egghead. Now! Go ahead!

571
00:55:09,261 --> 00:55:11,155
"Now?"

572
00:55:27,745 --> 00:55:29,518
Shit.

573
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:35,526
- Get the hell outta here. - All right, Johnny.

574
00:55:35,527 --> 00:55:38,627
But what about my money? - What money?

575
00:55:38,628 --> 00:55:40,995
Acey said you had some dough for me.

576
00:55:41,009 --> 00:55:45,889
- Is that a fact? How much do I owe you? - Acey said 10%.

577
00:55:45,972 --> 00:55:51,444
- Too bad Acey ain't in charge no more. - What do you mean?

578
00:55:51,445 --> 00:55:54,480
He's upstairs taking a bath.

579
00:55:54,606 --> 00:55:57,275
He'll call you when he gets out.

580
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:02,881
Hey. I tell you what I'm gonna give you, Snakes.

581
00:56:03,221 --> 00:56:06,326
- Snakes? - I'm gonna give you to the count of 10...

582
00:56:06,451 --> 00:56:08,745
to get your ugly, yellow...

583
00:56:08,828 --> 00:56:13,373
no-good keister off my property before I pump your guts full of lead.

584
00:56:13,374 --> 00:56:16,410
All right, Johnny, I'm sorry. I'm goin'.

585
00:56:16,411 --> 00:56:19,643
One, two, ten!

586
00:56:38,545 --> 00:56:41,715
Keep the change, ya filthy animal.

587
00:56:46,585 --> 00:56:49,766
What happened? I don't know who's in there, but somebody just got blown away!

588
00:56:49,767 --> 00:56:52,845
- Huh? Somebody @beat us to the job. They're in there!

589
00:56:52,846 --> 00:56:57,079
Two of' em. They was arguing. One of' em blew the other one away.

590
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,923
- Who? - I don't know.

591
00:56:59,223 --> 00:57:02,002
I thought I recognized one of their voices.

592
00:57:02,003 --> 00:57:04,259
And I know I heard that name Snakes before.

593
00:57:04,342 --> 00:57:08,675
Snakes? Snakes, Snakes. I don't know no Snakes.

594
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:11,724
- Snakes. Let's get out of here.

595
00:57:14,143 --> 00:57:17,716
Hold it, hold it. Let's wait and see who it is.

596
00:57:17,717 --> 00:57:19,356
We work this neighborhood too.

597
00:57:19,357 --> 00:57:22,147
- Yeah. - Supposin' the cops @finger us for a job...

598
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:25,259
and they start asking us questions about a murder in the area.

599
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:28,204
Wouldn't it be nice to have a face to go with their questions?

600
00:57:30,673 --> 00:57:32,634
That's a good idea.

601
00:57:32,635 --> 00:57:35,918
Of course it's a good idea. Snakes?

602
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:38,418
He sounded like a snake.

603
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,062
Everything's full.

604
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:47,718
Everything's full?

605
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:51,208
I'm very sorry, but it is Christmas Eve.

606
00:57:51,209 --> 00:57:52,594
What about another airline?

607
00:57:57,728 --> 00:58:00,884
Nothing available. May I help you get a hotel room in the city?

608
00:58:00,885 --> 00:58:03,008
Tomorrow afternoon we can get you a flight to Chicago.

609
00:58:03,009 --> 00:58:04,639
I can't wait that long.

610
00:58:04,812 --> 00:58:08,698
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am, but we're doing absolutely everything we can.

611
00:58:12,951 --> 00:58:16,272
Go ahead. I'm in your way. I'm sorry. You have places to go, people to see.

612
00:58:16,273 --> 00:58:20,122
You got a ticket there. That's good. Excuse me. Look.

613
00:58:20,123 --> 00:58:24,204
I have been awake for almost 60 hours. I'm tired and I'm dirty.

614
00:58:24,205 --> 00:58:28,612
I have been from Chicago to Paris to Dallas to... Where the hell am I?

615
00:58:28,613 --> 00:58:30,220
Scranton.

616
00:58:30,496 --> 00:58:33,517
I am trying to get home to my eight-year-old son!

617
00:58:34,016 --> 00:58:36,451
And now that I'm this close, you're telling me it's hopeless?

618
00:58:36,759 --> 00:58:39,470
I'm sorry. - No. No, no, no, no way.

619
00:58:39,471 --> 00:58:42,588
This is Christmas! The season of @perpetual hope!

620
00:58:43,016 --> 00:58:43,807
Ma'am, if I...

621
00:58:43,808 --> 00:58:46,135
And I don't care if I have to get out on your runway and hitchhike...

622
00:58:46,136 --> 00:58:47,912
if it costs me everything I own...

623
00:58:47,913 --> 00:58:51,114
if I have to sell my soul to the devil himself...

624
00:58:51,241 --> 00:58:54,623
I am going to get home to my son.

625
00:58:55,364 --> 00:58:58,861
Ma'am, if there was anything at all I could do for you today... - Do it.

626
00:58:58,862 --> 00:59:01,371
Do anything. - I can get you a hotel room.

627
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:03,457
What? - Excuse me.

628
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:09,676
Can you excuse us for a second? Can I see you for a second? Please. Excuse us. Come.

629
00:59:09,801 --> 00:59:12,971
Couldn't @help but hearin' you got a little bit of a dilemma there.

630
00:59:12,972 --> 00:59:15,682
We got a crisis ourselves.

631
00:59:15,807 --> 00:59:19,996
Allow me to introduce myself. Gus Polinski. How are you?

632
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:22,772
Polka king of the Midwest?

633
00:59:26,005 --> 00:59:28,403
The Kenosha Kickers?

634
00:59:28,486 --> 00:59:29,633
- Hi there. - Hiya.

635
00:59:29,634 --> 00:59:34,599
No? That's okay. I thought you might've recognized... Anyways, uh...

636
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,240
I had a few hits a few years ago.

637
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:41,945
Uh, that's why, you know... "Polka, Polka, Polka"?

638
00:59:42,125 --> 00:59:44,603
No? "Twin Lakes Polka."

639
00:59:44,604 --> 00:59:48,013
"Yamahoozie Polka," a.k.a. "Kiss Me Polka."

640
00:59:48,014 --> 00:59:51,225
"Polka Twist." - These are songs?

641
00:59:51,226 --> 00:59:54,196
Yeah. Yeah. We... Some fairly big hits for us.

642
00:59:54,197 --> 00:59:56,402
You know, in the early '70s, you know?

643
00:59:56,403 --> 00:59:59,474
Yeah, we sold about 623 copies of that.

644
00:59:59,475 --> 01:00:03,075
In Chicago? - No. Sheboygan. Very big in Sheboygan.

645
01:00:03,076 --> 01:00:04,656
I'm sorry. Did you say you could help me?

646
01:00:04,657 --> 01:00:09,843
Anyway, I'm rambling on here. Our flight was canceled, so we gotta drive.

647
01:00:09,844 --> 01:00:13,308
So, uh, see the guy in the yellow jacket over there by the Budget sign?

648
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:16,967
He's gonna rent us a nice big, uh, van, and we're gonna drive to Milwaukee.

649
01:00:16,968 --> 01:00:22,012
I heard you had some problems here, uh, gettin' to Chicago to see your kid or somethin'?

650
01:00:22,013 --> 01:00:26,276
Uh, my son. He... We left and he's there.

651
01:00:26,277 --> 01:00:30,089
Aw, geez. If you have to get to Chicago, we'll gladly drive you.

652
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:32,467
It's on the way to Milwaukee.

653
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:35,302
- You'd give me a ride? - Sure we will. Why not, you know?

654
01:00:35,303 --> 01:00:38,223
- You gotta get home and see your kid. - A ride to Chicago?

655
01:00:38,224 --> 01:00:40,461
Sure. You know, it's Christmastime.

656
01:00:40,614 --> 01:00:42,389
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

657
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:46,856
If you don't mind goin' with some polka bums. - No, I'd love to.

658
01:01:08,846 --> 01:01:11,724
- Hey, Marv, Marv, Marv. - What?

659
01:01:11,895 --> 01:01:13,263
Look at this.

660
01:01:19,335 --> 01:01:23,715
I think we're gettin' scammed by a "kindygartener."

661
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:56,079
Dad, can you come here and help me?

662
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:05,609
Remember that kid we saw the other day? He lives here.

663
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:10,064
Well, if the kid's there, the parents gotta be. - He's home alone.

664
01:02:18,214 --> 01:02:20,736
You gotta be kiddin'. You wanna come back tonight?

665
01:02:20,744 --> 01:02:22,285
- Uh-huh. - Even with the kid here?

666
01:02:22,368 --> 01:02:24,213
- Uh-huh. - I don't think that's a good idea, Harry.

667
01:02:24,214 --> 01:02:27,661
Hey, look. That house is the only reason we started workin' this block in the first place.

668
01:02:27,662 --> 01:02:30,288
Ever since I laid eyes on that house, I wanted it.

669
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:32,624
So let's take it one step at a time, okay?

670
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:37,586
We'll unload the van. We'll get a bite to eat. We'll come back about 9:00.

671
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,448
- 9:00. - This way it's dark then.

672
01:02:40,453 --> 01:02:43,305
Yeah. Kids are scared of the dark.

673
01:02:43,306 --> 01:02:46,142
You're afraid of the dark too, Marv. You know you are.

674
01:02:47,623 --> 01:02:49,019
No, I'm not!

675
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:51,309
Yes, you are. - I'm not, not, not.

676
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:55,860
You are so. - Mom, where are you?

677
01:03:09,136 --> 01:03:11,054
Do you play?

678
01:03:11,251 --> 01:03:13,415
You want to try it? Go ahead. Try it.

679
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:15,291
- Try it. Try it. - No.

680
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:16,684
Okay.

681
01:03:27,516 --> 01:03:30,818
...

682
01:03:42,197 --> 01:03:45,617
- Excuse me. - Yeah?

683
01:03:46,137 --> 01:03:49,705
- Hey, nice shoes. - Oh, thanks.

684
01:03:49,706 --> 01:03:53,334
Is he still here? It's really important that I see him.

685
01:03:53,418 --> 01:03:58,715
He's getting in his car. I guess if you hurry, you can catch him.

686
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:03,385
Damn! How low can you get? Givin' Kris Kringle a parking ticket on Christmas Eve.

687
01:04:03,386 --> 01:04:06,259
What's next? Rabies shots for the Easter Bunny?

688
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:08,569
Santa, hold on!

689
01:04:09,915 --> 01:04:11,600
Can I talk to you for a minute?

690
01:04:11,607 --> 01:04:14,312
If you make it quick. Santa's got a little @get-together he's late for.

691
01:04:14,313 --> 01:04:17,138
Okay. I know you're not the real Santa Claus.

692
01:04:17,139 --> 01:04:20,486
What makes you say that? Just out of curiosity.

693
01:04:20,612 --> 01:04:24,250
I'm old enough to know how it works. - All right.

694
01:04:24,251 --> 01:04:26,726
But I also know that you work for him.

695
01:04:26,727 --> 01:04:29,537
- And I'd like you to give him a message. - Shoot.

696
01:04:29,621 --> 01:04:33,979
I'm Kevin McCallister, 671 Lincoln Boulevard.

697
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:36,256
- Do you need the phone number? - No, that's all right.

698
01:04:36,257 --> 01:04:38,796
Okay. This is extremely important.

699
01:04:38,922 --> 01:04:44,216
Would you please tell him that, instead of presents this year, I just want my family back.

700
01:04:44,435 --> 01:04:49,064
No toys. Nothing but Peter, Kate, Buzz, Megan, Linnie and Jeff.

701
01:04:49,065 --> 01:04:51,017
And my aunt and my cousins.

702
01:04:51,288 --> 01:04:55,036
And, if he has time, my Uncle Frank. Okay?

703
01:04:56,022 --> 01:05:00,755
Okay. I'll see what I can do. - Thanks.

704
01:05:00,756 --> 01:05:05,448
- Wait. Hold on a second. My elf took the last of the candy canes home to her boyfriend.

705
01:05:05,522 --> 01:05:07,699
- That's okay. - No, no, no. Don't be silly.

706
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:10,703
Everybody who sees Santa has gotta get... somethin'.

707
01:05:10,704 --> 01:05:14,658
Here. Hold out your little paw there. There you go.

708
01:05:15,058 --> 01:05:19,184
Don't spoil your dinner. - I won't. Thanks.

709
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:32,179
Son of a...

710
01:08:29,209 --> 01:08:32,487
Merry Christmas. - Huh?

711
01:08:32,954 --> 01:08:34,998
May I sit down?

712
01:08:45,941 --> 01:08:50,138
That's my granddaughter up there. The little red-haired girl.

713
01:08:51,716 --> 01:08:56,122
She's about your age. Do you know her? - No.

714
01:08:56,123 --> 01:08:59,080
- You live next to me, don't you? - Yeah.

715
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:03,494
You can say hello when you see me. You don't have to be afraid.

716
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:09,024
There's a lot of things going around about me, but none of it's true. Okay?

717
01:09:09,773 --> 01:09:12,283
- You been a good boy this year? - I think so.

718
01:09:12,383 --> 01:09:13,988
Swear to it?

719
01:09:14,072 --> 01:09:17,366
- No. - Yeah, I had a feeling.

720
01:09:17,367 --> 01:09:20,187
Well, this is the place to be if you're feeling bad about yourself.

721
01:09:20,461 --> 01:09:23,039
- It is? - I think so.

722
01:09:23,122 --> 01:09:26,062
- Are you feeling bad about yourself? - No.

723
01:09:30,088 --> 01:09:35,197
I've been kind of a pain lately. I said some things I shouldn't have.

724
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:38,410
I really haven't been too good this year.

725
01:09:39,023 --> 01:09:43,393
- Yeah. - I'm kind of upset about it... because I really like my family.

726
01:09:43,518 --> 01:09:46,050
Even though sometimes I say I don't.

727
01:09:46,051 --> 01:09:50,058
Sometimes I even think I don't. Do you get that?

728
01:09:50,059 --> 01:09:55,066
I think so. How you feel about your family is a complicated thing.

729
01:09:55,067 --> 01:09:57,740
Especially with an older brother.

730
01:09:58,249 --> 01:10:02,637
Deep down you always love 'em, but you can forget that you love 'em.

731
01:10:02,638 --> 01:10:04,914
And you can hurt them, and they can hurt you.

732
01:10:05,287 --> 01:10:07,287
And that's not just because you're young.

733
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:12,212
You want to know the real reason that I'm here right now?

734
01:10:12,213 --> 01:10:13,626
Sure.

735
01:10:14,215 --> 01:10:18,195
I came to hear my granddaughter sing, and I can't come and hear her tonight.

736
01:10:18,495 --> 01:10:23,600
- You have plans? - No. I'm not welcome.

737
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:27,520
- At church? - Oh, you're always welcome at church.

738
01:10:27,883 --> 01:10:30,023
I'm not welcome with my son.

739
01:10:31,342 --> 01:10:34,819
Years back, before you and your family moved on the block...

740
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:37,405
I had an argument with my son.

741
01:10:38,415 --> 01:10:41,784
- How old is he? - Oh, he's grown up.

742
01:10:42,663 --> 01:10:47,582
We lost our tempers... and I said I didn't care to see him anymore.

743
01:10:47,665 --> 01:10:52,587
He said the same, and we haven't spoken to each other since.

744
01:10:53,395 --> 01:10:55,507
If you miss him, why don't you call him?

745
01:10:56,077 --> 01:10:58,425
I'm afraid if I call him, he won't talk to me.

746
01:10:58,426 --> 01:11:00,274
How do you know?

747
01:11:01,002 --> 01:11:03,723
I don't know. I'm just afraid he won't.

748
01:11:04,354 --> 01:11:08,409
No offense, but aren't you a little old to be afraid?

749
01:11:08,924 --> 01:11:11,147
You can be a little old for a lot of things.

750
01:11:11,272 --> 01:11:13,290
You're never too old to be afraid.

751
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:16,361
That's true. I've always been afraid of our basement.

752
01:11:16,486 --> 01:11:20,030
It's dark, there's weird stuff down there, and it smells funny.

753
01:11:20,031 --> 01:11:23,607
That sort of thing. It's bothered me for years.

754
01:11:23,924 --> 01:11:25,954
Basements are like that.

755
01:11:26,037 --> 01:11:28,957
Then I made myself go down there to do some laundry...

756
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,042
and I found out it's not so bad.

757
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:33,331
All this time I've been worrying about it...

758
01:11:33,332 --> 01:11:36,055
but if you turn on the lights, it's no big deal.

759
01:11:36,295 --> 01:11:40,694
- What's your point? - My point is you should call your son.

760
01:11:41,341 --> 01:11:44,509
What if he won't talk to me? - At least you'll know.

761
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:46,412
Then you could stop worrying about it...

762
01:11:46,413 --> 01:11:48,852
and you won't have to be afraid anymore.

763
01:11:49,332 --> 01:11:52,266
I don't care how mad I was, I'd talk to my dad...

764
01:11:52,267 --> 01:11:55,002
especially around the holidays.

765
01:11:56,056 --> 01:11:57,838
I don't know.

766
01:11:58,004 --> 01:12:01,021
Just give it a shot. For your granddaughter anyway.

767
01:12:01,128 --> 01:12:04,707
I'm sure she misses you... and the presents.

768
01:12:04,928 --> 01:12:06,244
I send her a check.

769
01:12:07,055 --> 01:12:10,742
I wish my grandparents sent that. They always send me clothes.

770
01:12:10,862 --> 01:12:13,901
Last year I got a sweater with a big bird knitted on it.

771
01:12:14,127 --> 01:12:17,255
- Oh, that's nice. - Not for a guy in the second grade.

772
01:12:17,562 --> 01:12:20,091
You can get beat up for wearing something like that.

773
01:12:20,216 --> 01:12:22,340
- Oh? - Yeah.

774
01:12:22,341 --> 01:12:26,984
I have a friend who got nailed 'cause there was a rumor he wore dinosaur pajamas.

775
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:30,179
You'd better run along home where you belong.

776
01:12:30,837 --> 01:12:32,290
You think about what I said.

777
01:12:32,457 --> 01:12:33,937
- All right? - Okay.

778
01:12:34,704 --> 01:12:38,583
- It was nice talking to you. - Nice talking to you.

779
01:12:44,979 --> 01:12:47,638
- What about you? - Me?

780
01:12:47,639 --> 01:12:49,562
Yeah. You and your son.

781
01:12:51,109 --> 01:12:56,067
We'll see what happens. Merry Christmas.

782
01:12:56,714 --> 01:12:58,633
Merry Christmas.

783
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:54,352
This is my house. I have to defend it.

784
01:13:59,314 --> 01:14:02,317
...

785
01:14:26,466 --> 01:14:28,844
...

786
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:25,818
Okay, we'll check it out first. We can always come back for the truck.

787
01:15:33,768 --> 01:15:35,387
How do you wanna go in?

788
01:15:35,388 --> 01:15:38,627
We'll go to the back door. Maybe he'll let us in. You never know.

789
01:15:38,628 --> 01:15:41,793
Yeah. He's a kid. Kids are stupid.

790
01:15:43,837 --> 01:15:47,842
Bless this highly nutritious microwavable macaroni and cheese dinner...

791
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:50,984
and the people who sold it on sale. Amen.

792
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:18,621
This is it. Don't get scared now.

793
01:16:31,926 --> 01:16:34,900
Merry Christmas, little fella.

794
01:16:35,367 --> 01:16:40,581
We know that you're in there... and that you're all alone.

795
01:16:40,788 --> 01:16:43,051
Yeah, come on, kid. Open up.

796
01:16:44,008 --> 01:16:47,553
It's Santa Claus and his elf.

797
01:16:48,988 --> 01:16:50,974
We're not gonna hurt you.

798
01:16:50,975 --> 01:16:54,157
No, no. We got some nice presents for you.

799
01:16:54,619 --> 01:16:58,081
Be a good little fella now and open the door.

800
01:17:00,388 --> 01:17:04,245
Shoot! - What?

801
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:09,917
What? What? What?

802
01:17:09,918 --> 01:17:12,405
What happened? - Get that little...

803
01:17:23,913 --> 01:17:25,453
Hello.

804
01:17:30,961 --> 01:17:33,591
Yes! Yes!

805
01:17:33,778 --> 01:17:35,614
The little jerk is armed!

806
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:39,536
That's it! That's it! I'm goin' around the front! You go down the basement!

807
01:17:39,619 --> 01:17:42,080
That little...

808
01:18:42,056 --> 01:18:44,267
That @smart aleck.

809
01:20:12,513 --> 01:20:16,943
Oh, boy, that's it, you little... you little son of a...

810
01:20:17,068 --> 01:20:20,523
Oh, not this time, you little brat.

811
01:20:23,616 --> 01:20:26,077
You little creep, you, where are you?

812
01:20:26,202 --> 01:20:29,244
Where are you, you little creep?

813
01:20:50,101 --> 01:20:54,022
Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes!

814
01:21:24,761 --> 01:21:27,555
I'll rip his head off!

815
01:21:37,338 --> 01:21:38,758
You're dead, kid.

816
01:22:26,045 --> 01:22:28,859
Where are you, you little creep?

817
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:47,978
Harry! I'm comin' in!

818
01:22:52,559 --> 01:22:54,808
Oh, no, I'm really scared!

819
01:22:54,809 --> 01:22:57,809
It's too late for you, kid. We're already in the house.

820
01:22:57,810 --> 01:23:01,311
We're gonna get you! - Okay. Come and get me.

821
01:23:01,312 --> 01:23:03,229
Why, you...

822
01:23:08,866 --> 01:23:11,128
Now you're dead!

823
01:23:35,914 --> 01:23:38,022
I'm gonna kill that kid!

824
01:23:53,574 --> 01:23:55,619
- Marv! - Harry?

825
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:57,884
Why the hell'd you take your shoes off?

826
01:23:58,278 --> 01:24:00,617
Why the hell are you dressed like a chicken?

827
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:05,833
I'm up here, you morons! Come and get me!

828
01:24:08,831 --> 01:24:12,228
You guys give up, or are you thirsty for more?

829
01:24:21,646 --> 01:24:24,107
- @Heads up! - Huh?

830
01:24:26,348 --> 01:24:28,970
Don't worry, Marv. I'll get him for you.

831
01:24:33,025 --> 01:24:34,606
Yes!

832
01:24:39,278 --> 01:24:41,738
He's only a kid, Harry. We can take him.

833
01:24:41,739 --> 01:24:44,999
- Aw, shut up, will ya! What is it?

834
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,308
- You're missin' some teeth. Where?

835
01:24:48,309 --> 01:24:53,173
It's my gold tooth. My gold tooth! I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

836
01:24:54,805 --> 01:24:57,389
You bomb me with one more can, kid...

837
01:24:57,390 --> 01:25:01,561
and I'll snap off your @cojones and boil them in motor oil!

838
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,431
911 Emergency.

839
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:13,656
Help. My house is being robbed. My address is 656 Lincoln Boulevard. My name's Murphy.

840
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:18,912
Watch it. You never know what's up there.

841
01:25:19,037 --> 01:25:20,644
There he is!

842
01:25:23,115 --> 01:25:27,941
Ah! I got ya! I got him, Harry!

843
01:25:28,338 --> 01:25:33,243
Harry, I got him! Harry, get up! Give me a hand!

844
01:25:36,342 --> 01:25:40,193
I got him! Harry, help me! Get up!

845
01:25:41,156 --> 01:25:42,943
I got him!

846
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:26,896
- What are you doing, Marv? - Harry, don't move.

847
01:26:27,321 --> 01:26:30,942
- Marv? - Don't... move!

848
01:26:31,335 --> 01:26:34,442
Marv, what are you doing? Marv...

849
01:26:37,828 --> 01:26:41,041
Did I get him? Did I get him?

850
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:43,969
Where is it? Where is it?

851
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:46,702
Never mind did you get it! How do you like it? Huh?

852
01:26:46,703 --> 01:26:50,628
You jerk! Get that kid! Go on! Get the kid!

853
01:27:17,131 --> 01:27:18,907
Where'd he go?

854
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:21,034
Maybe he committed suicide.

855
01:27:21,514 --> 01:27:26,399
Down here, you big horse's ass! Come and get me before I call the police!

856
01:27:26,626 --> 01:27:28,707
- Let's get him! - Wait. Wait.

857
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:30,668
That's just what he wants us to do...

858
01:27:31,031 --> 01:27:34,255
us to go back downstairs through his fun house so we get all @tore up.

859
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:37,592
- He's gonna call the cops! - He's not callin' the... From a tree house?

860
01:27:37,675 --> 01:27:39,594
Come on.

861
01:27:39,677 --> 01:27:42,289
- Out the window? - Yeah.

862
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:45,087
- I'm not goin' out the window. - Why? Are you scared, Marv?

863
01:27:45,088 --> 01:27:47,435
Are you afraid? Come on. Get out here.

864
01:27:52,396 --> 01:27:53,942
Come on.

865
01:27:59,908 --> 01:28:01,162
Come on!

866
01:28:07,322 --> 01:28:08,375
Keep goin'. Keep goin'.

867
01:28:08,376 --> 01:28:10,317
Let's go back, Harry. - Shut up!

868
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:17,334
Shut it, Marv!

869
01:28:20,602 --> 01:28:23,521
Hey, guys, check this out.

870
01:28:24,122 --> 01:28:26,331
Go back! Go back!

871
01:28:26,332 --> 01:28:27,833
- Go back. - Okay.

872
01:28:52,381 --> 01:28:56,702
There he goes! There he is! Get out of the way, you dope!

873
01:29:14,877 --> 01:29:18,675
- There he is! - Hey, I'm calling the cops.

874
01:29:19,277 --> 01:29:22,197
Wait, wait, wait, wait. He wants us to follow him.

875
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:24,407
I got a better idea. Come on.

876
01:29:42,064 --> 01:29:47,925
Hiya, pal. We outsmarted you this time. Get over here!

877
01:29:53,219 --> 01:29:54,925
What are we gonna do to him, Harry?

878
01:29:54,926 --> 01:29:59,156
We'll do exactly what he did to us. I'm gonna burn his head with a blowtorch.

879
01:29:59,183 --> 01:30:01,544
Then we can smash his face with an iron!

880
01:30:01,684 --> 01:30:04,523
I'd like to slap him right in the face with a paint can maybe.

881
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:06,318
Or shove a nail through his foot.

882
01:30:06,319 --> 01:30:11,183
First thing I'm gonna is biting off every one of these little fingers one at a time.

883
01:30:20,388 --> 01:30:23,284
Come on. Let's get you home.

884
01:30:45,849 --> 01:30:48,731
Wow. This is great.

885
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:54,496
Nice move... always leaving the water running.

886
01:30:54,497 --> 01:30:57,884
Now we know each and every house that you've hit.

887
01:31:01,607 --> 01:31:04,645
Hey, you know, we've been looking for you two guys for a long time.

888
01:31:04,646 --> 01:31:07,926
- Yeah. - Well, remember, we're the Wet Bandits.

889
01:31:07,927 --> 01:31:11,838
- Wet Bandits. W-E-T... - Shut up! Get in the car!

890
01:31:12,052 --> 01:31:14,296
Hey, come on. Come on.

891
01:31:14,684 --> 01:31:17,020
- Hands off the head, pal! - Come on!

892
01:32:12,742 --> 01:32:15,905
I'm a bad parent. I'm a bad parent. - You're not.

893
01:32:15,906 --> 01:32:18,068
You know, you're beating yourself up there, you know.

894
01:32:18,069 --> 01:32:21,828
Come on. This happens. These things happen. You know, you...

895
01:32:21,829 --> 01:32:24,504
Gee, you wanna talk about bad parents? Look at... Look at us.

896
01:32:24,629 --> 01:32:27,510
I mean, we're on the road 48, 49 weeks out of the year.

897
01:32:27,511 --> 01:32:32,599
We hardly see our families. Uh, Joe over there... Gosh, you know, he...

898
01:32:32,812 --> 01:32:35,549
He forgets his kids' names half the time.

899
01:32:35,736 --> 01:32:39,185
Ziggy over there... He doesn't even... He's never even met his kid.

900
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:42,981
Eddie... Let's just hope none of them write a book about him.

901
01:32:44,337 --> 01:32:47,937
Tell me, have you ever gone on vacation and left your child home?

902
01:32:51,171 --> 01:32:52,866
No.

903
01:32:52,991 --> 01:32:56,411
But I did leave one at a funeral parlor once.

904
01:32:56,536 --> 01:32:58,937
Yeah, it was... it was terrible too.

905
01:32:58,938 --> 01:33:02,160
You know, I was all distraught and everything. You know, the wife and I...

906
01:33:02,161 --> 01:33:07,158
we left the little tyke there in the funeral parlor all day. All day.

907
01:33:07,159 --> 01:33:10,551
You know, and we went back at night when we came to our senses.

908
01:33:10,717 --> 01:33:15,256
And there he was. Apparently he was there alone all day with a corpse.

909
01:33:15,502 --> 01:33:21,603
He was okay, you know. After six, seven weeks, you know, he @came around and started talking again.

910
01:33:22,863 --> 01:33:26,149
But he's okay. You know, they get over it. Kids are resilient like that.

911
01:33:26,232 --> 01:33:28,864
- Maybe we shouldn't talk about this. - Well, you brought it up.

912
01:33:28,865 --> 01:33:32,367
- I was just trying to cheer you up. - Well, I'm sorry I did.

913
01:33:58,287 --> 01:34:00,164
Mom?

914
01:34:04,718 --> 01:34:06,198
Mom?

915
01:34:10,155 --> 01:34:11,832
Mom?

916
01:34:58,443 --> 01:35:02,488
Kevin? Kevin!

917
01:35:33,751 --> 01:35:35,404
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

918
01:35:45,322 --> 01:35:47,567
Oh, Kevin, I'm so sorry.

919
01:36:07,601 --> 01:36:09,584
Where is everybody else?

920
01:36:10,864 --> 01:36:13,932
Oh, baby, they couldn't come. They wanted to so much, but...

921
01:36:13,933 --> 01:36:18,112
I didn't fall asleep in the back of the cab and drool all over you, did I?

922
01:36:18,196 --> 01:36:19,622
I don't drool. - You guys, would you shut up!

923
01:36:19,623 --> 01:36:24,304
Come on, you guys, it's Christmas. - Kevin! Kevin, Kevin, my boy!

924
01:36:24,305 --> 01:36:27,115
- Oh, my God! Kevin, how are ya? - Merry Christmas.

925
01:36:27,116 --> 01:36:31,067
- Hi, Mom. Good to see you. - Ah, you're all right. I love you. You okay?

926
01:36:31,068 --> 01:36:33,711
- Yeah. - Hey, Kev.

927
01:36:35,973 --> 01:36:38,642
It's pretty cool that you didn't burn the place down.

928
01:36:40,624 --> 01:36:42,688
Thanks, Buzz.

929
01:36:43,945 --> 01:36:46,411
Wait a minute. How did you guys get home?

930
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:48,134
Oh, we took the morning flight. Remember?

931
01:36:48,135 --> 01:36:52,430
The one you didn't want to wait for. - Oh, no. Oh, thank you.

932
01:36:52,431 --> 01:36:54,529
- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

933
01:36:54,530 --> 01:36:56,956
Someone has to find an open store. We don't even have milk here.

934
01:36:57,075 --> 01:36:58,562
I went shopping yesterday.

935
01:37:01,361 --> 01:37:03,058
You? Shopping?

936
01:37:03,059 --> 01:37:05,979
I got some milk, eggs and fabric softener.

937
01:37:07,706 --> 01:37:09,663
- What? - No kiddin'?

938
01:37:09,664 --> 01:37:13,929
What a funny guy. What else did you do while we were away?

939
01:37:14,923 --> 01:37:16,996
Just hung around.

940
01:37:19,504 --> 01:37:21,993
You guys, put the stuff upstairs. - You went shopping?

941
01:37:21,994 --> 01:37:25,274
He doesn't know how to tie his shoe, and he's going shopping?

942
01:37:25,275 --> 01:37:28,082
- Buzz, forget it. - This is not the Kevin I knew.

943
01:37:52,329 --> 01:37:54,137
Honey, what's this?

944
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:55,796
Kevin! What did you do to my room?

945
01:39:06,208 --> 01:39:09,461
