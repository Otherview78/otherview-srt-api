96
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,394
Yes.

97
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,564
Not bad money to sit on a

98
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,317

If it wasn't for Rama and Allah,

00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,673
I would still have a mother.

159
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,476

00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,029
Gandhi-ji.

351
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:12,158
Oh. I've heard of him.

352
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,662
Don't get clever,

353
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,789
or I'll get the electricity
out again.

354
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:21,500
Look.

355
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:23,878
They didn't ask me
that question.

356
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:27,089
I don't know why.
Ask them.

357
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:31,135
It's funny. You don't seem
that interested in money.

358
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,265
As a matter of fact,
you have...

359
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:39,185
one million rupees!

360
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,358
Explain the $100 bill.

361
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:52,114
Bombay had turned
into Mumbai.

362
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:57,328
Why can't you understand?

363
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,455
I'm sick of this now.

364
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:08,816
<i>Two chicken burgers, two
fries, one man go lassi, one Coke.</i>

365
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,818
One mineral water.

366
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:15,906
Shimla.

367
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:19,034
I'm going to Chowpatty,
okay?

368
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:21,787
Wanna come?

369
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:25,541
For God's sake.
You've got some disease.

370
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,127
You forced me back
to this shithole,

371
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:33,173
we leave our friends, a good life,
loads of money... for this?

372
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:36,427
We came back to find her.
You <i>did</i>

373
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,429
I don't give a shit
about her.

374
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,389
Plenty of pussy in Bombay
for Salim.

375
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,433
Oh, yes, sir.

376
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,769
You should come back to
the cages on Saturday night...

377
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,897
instead of go searching
for your lost love.

378
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:50,941
I'm going to Chowpatty.

379
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:53,569
"I'm going to Chowpatty."

380
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:57,823
There are 19 million people
in this city,Jamal.

381
00:51:58,866 --> 00:52:02,328
Forget about her.
She's history.

382
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,698
Dollars?

383
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:44,453
100.

384
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,388
Benjamin Franklin.

385
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,778
I'm sorry, Arvind.

386
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,264
Thanks.

387
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,300
Oh. Sorry.

388
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,471
Cherry?

389
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:17,731
So, is it her or not?

390
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:26,114
<i>She's sexy, man.</i>

391
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:28,200
Latika!

392
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,289
Who is this?
Jamal?

393
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,959
- I'll get the bag.
- Who are you? What do you want?

394
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,544
Quick!
<i>You stupid boys.</i>

395
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,587
Come on. Pack it in.
What are you doing?

396
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:43,340
- How did you find me?
- Later. Later.

397
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,717
<i>No, not
everything.</i>

398
00:55:45,801 --> 00:55:47,678
<i>Get out, if you can.</i>

399
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:50,514
<i>Take the cash. Take the
cash. Come on. We gotta go.</i>

400
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,225
Let's
go. Let's go. Shit.

401
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:57,020
Look who we have here.

402
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,732
Hello again,

403
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:03,485
Jamal,

404
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:05,571
Salim.

405
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:08,615
<i>Never forget a face.</i>

406
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:11,243
Hey, Punnoose?

407
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,495
<i>Especially one
that I own.</i>

408
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:21,795
You really thought you could just
walk in and take my prize away?

409
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:24,756
<i>Latika, come.</i>

410
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:33,223
Have you any idea how
much this little virgin is worth?

411
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:38,145
<i>- Please continue, Master-ji</i>
- Okay, sir.

412
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,397
- Get them out of here.
- No!

413
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,447
Move!

414
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,282
Get over there.

415
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,535
Let's not be foolish,
Salim.

416
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,790
<i>Heavy, isn't it?
Give it to me.</i>

417
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:00,542
Huh?

418
00:57:00,626 --> 00:57:03,128
On your knees.
Down!

419
00:57:04,963 --> 00:57:06,965
Both of you, down!

420
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,263
Money!

421
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:16,725
You can have money.

422
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,644
<i>Here.</i>

423
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:23,649
Look.

424
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,111
<i>Take it. Go.</i>

425
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:32,115
Disappear with your... friend,
and we'll forget all about this. Okay?

426
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,701
Maman never forgets.

427
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,287
Isn't that right?

428
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:40,666
Oh, Maman can
make an exception, huh?

429
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,712
I can't take that risk,
Maman. Sorry.

430
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,976
<i>Let's go!</i>

431
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:01,228
Stay!

432
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,938
<i>Jamal!</i>

433
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,231
Jamal.

434
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:10,362
<i>Let's go! Let's go!</i>

435
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:22,749
<i>Who invented the revolver?</i>

436
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:30,632
Samuel Colt.

437
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:33,385
Final answer?

438
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,430
Final answer.

439
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,266
Jamal Malik,

440
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,268
you're on a dream run.

441
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,439
My heart says
you're gonna win more.

442
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,733
<i>Computer-ji,</i>

443
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:49,735
<i>"A" lock kiya-jaye.</i>

444
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:58,368
I was right.

445
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:01,872
The chai wallah
has done it again.

446
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,668
Incredible!

447
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:25,145
Service! Reception!

448
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:36,198
Oh!

449
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,337
Found something. <i> Stay there. Look away,</i>

450
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:56,134
<i>I know if you're looking.</i>

451
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:58,428
No, I'm not.

452
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,514
<i>ls Salim still there?</i>

453
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:09,356
Where's Salim?

454
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:15,070
Don't know.

455
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:19,783
You're a sweet boy,Jamal.

456
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:14,546
I'm looking for Javed.

457
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:17,090
He's not
looking for you.

458
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:23,847
I killed Maman.

459
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,891
And I'll kill you too.

460
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:31,855
Easy.

461
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,774
<i>Did you really kill him?</i>

462
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:41,489
Good.

463
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:44,659
<i>My enemy's enemy
is a friend</i>

464
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:49,497
<i>Come here, my friend</i>

465
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:57,881
Mm. I've been looking
for someone like you.

466
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:07,432
You came back for me.

467
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,186
Of course.

468
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:16,816
I thought you'd forgotten.

469
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:22,197
I never forgot.
Not for one moment.

470
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,991
<i>I knew I'd find you
in the end</i>

471
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:28,119
It's our destiny.

472
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,414
Destiny.

473
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:53,478
Hey.

474
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,568
Come.

475
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:03,196
No, Brother.
You've had a lot to drink.

476
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,199
I am the elder.
I am the boss.

477
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:09,077
For once you do
as I say.

478
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,079
Now get out.

479
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:13,873
Come on.
I saved your life, didn't I?

480
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,917
Salim, please-

481
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:18,795
I'll kill you!

482
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,588
Kill you!

483
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,846
I'll kill you!

484
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:35,020
I am number one now.

485
01:03:37,731 --> 01:03:41,026
Salim!

486
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:44,112
Salim, open it!

487
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,156
Shut up!

488
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,241
The man with the Colt .45
says shut up!

489
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:53,705
Go now, or Gunmaster G-9 will shoot you
right between the eyes.

490
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:56,666
Don't think he won't.

491
01:03:56,750 --> 01:04:01,046
I'm giving you five seconds.
One,

492
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,758
two-

493
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:08,762
Go,Jamal.

494
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:11,890
Go.

495
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:40,502
So, did you
see them again?

496
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:42,796
I wouldn't be here
if I had.

497
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:46,758
Was she pretty?

498
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:51,429
I guess not.

499
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:55,767
The most beautiful
woman in the world.

500
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,061
He means "the bitch
of the slums."

501
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:00,814
Hey. Hey!

502
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:05,735
<i>Hey, no-</i>

503
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:12,367
<i>Well, well.</i>

504
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,202
The slumdog barks.

505
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,788
<i>Money and women-</i>

506
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:19,040
<i>the reasons to make
most mistakes in life.</i>

507
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:20,792
<i>Correct.</i>

508
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:22,836
Looks like you're
mixed up with both.

509
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,632
Srinivas.

510
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:30,009
You need the exercise.

511
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:33,054
<i>Go and get me something
to eat.</i>

512
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:35,056
Yes, sir.

513
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,100
<i>And chai</i>

514
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:41,146
Phaode!

515
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:50,321
Idiot, Srinivas.

516
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,496
You puzzle me, slumdog-

517
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:02,542
admitting murder to avoid
the charge of fraud...

518
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,961
is not exactly
clever thinking.

519
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:09,966
Now, why would you do that?

520
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,177
Hmm?

521
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:15,346
When somebody asks me
a question,

522
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,557
I tell them the answer.

523
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:21,603
Hmm.

524
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:28,026
So, how did you manage to get
on the show?

525
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:32,280
<i>Okay,
everyone. Listen up.</i>

526
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:35,658
It's been a big week
for U.K.

527
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,660
Kat is back.

528
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:39,579
But she was already back.

529
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,998
<i>Bardi Jamal?</i>

530
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:46,085
Oh, well, she did come back.
Then she went <i>away...</i>

531
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:49,214
when Alfie split up with her,
and now she's back again.

532
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:51,508
But it looks as if
Alfie still fancies Mo after all.

533
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:54,010
Thank you,Jamal.
Bardi, keep up.

534
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:57,180
<i>The chai wallah knows
more than you.</i>

<i>Anyway, there's also
the festival in Edinburgh.</i>

536
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,770
<i>Anybody knows Edinburgh?
Edinburgh?</i>

537
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:08,525
Ah, kilts, castles,
uh, haggis, uh, Ben Nevis.

538
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:10,527
<i>Good Yes?</i>

539
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:14,155
<i>Inspector
Taggart, whiskey, Sean Connery.</i>

542
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:28,253
Jamal, come here.

543
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:30,547
<i>I'm on</i> Millionaire <i>duty

544
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:33,424
- Dave- - Please.
Just for five minutes.

545
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:34,842
I can't.

546
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:37,470
Sit here.
If the team leader comes,

547
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:40,932
just pretend you are on a call doing an
upgrade for- Friends and Family. I know.

548
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,017
Yah.
Two minutes.

549
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:44,602
Ah.

Bloody bastard.
I never get it!

557
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:11,087
You have to dial
when Prem says "if."

558
01:08:11,212 --> 01:08:14,299
That's when they open the lines.
How the hell do you know that?

559
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:17,594
That's what Anjum in technical
says. He put the system in.

01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:29,897
Uh, hello,

Mrs. Mackintosh

<i>It's Kingussie, love.
Pronounced "Kingussie."</i>

566
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:41,492
So where are you from?
Abroad, I bet.

567
01:08:41,576 --> 01:08:44,829
Uh,just down the
road from your house, Mrs. Mackintosh.

568
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:46,539
Uh, next to the loch.

569
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:49,375
<i>Och aye?
Which loch?</i>

570
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,502
Loch-

571
01:08:51,586 --> 01:08:55,131
Loch-
Big... Loch Ben.

572
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:58,968
Loch Big Ben. Next door
to Sean Connery's flat.

573
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:01,804
I'd like to speak to your supervisor, son.

574
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,854
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Salim?

575
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:55,191
Who is this? Do you know
what time is this?

576
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:04,784
Hello?

577
01:10:17,672 --> 01:10:21,509
Hello? Hello?

578
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:24,053
<i>Who is this?</i>

579
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,933
I'm calling from
XL 5 Communications, sir.

580

As a valued customer, we are
offering you a free upgrade...

581
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:33,396

Jamal?

584
01:10:40,194 --> 01:10:42,905
I-Is that you, Brother?

585
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:45,950
Where are you? I thought you
were dead or something.

586
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:48,786
Listen.
We had to go,Jamal.

587
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:52,874
Maman's guys- they were
searching the hotel.

588
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:56,586
Jamal? Say something,
please!

589
01:10:57,879 --> 01:11:00,631
Hello, Salim.

590
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:02,884
<i>Cambridge
Circus is not in Cambridge.</i>

591
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:05,011
<i>Dare I ask why?</i>

592
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:06,846
Too obvious.

593
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,015
<i>There's definitely
an Oxford Circus in London.</i>

594
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:14,061
<i>And there's a rowing race between
Oxford and Cambridge, so there's probably..</i>

595
01:11:14,145 --> 01:11:16,105
A Cambridge Circus too, no?

596
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:18,357
I'll go for "D," London.

597
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:23,905
<i>Computer-ji,
"D" lock kiya-jaye.</i>

598
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:32,955
<i>Jamal Malik,</i>

599
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,333
you're absolutely right!

600
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:47,637
<i>It's getting hot in here.</i>

601
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:49,806
Are you nervous?
What?

602
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:52,683
Am I nervous?

603
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:55,353
It's you who's in
the hot seat, my friend.

604
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:57,313
Oh, yes.

605
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,565
Sorry.

606
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:01,943
Bloody hell,
he's got Prem on the run.

607
01:12:02,068 --> 01:12:04,654
Finally.
A few hours ago,

608
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:08,825
you were giving chai
for the phone wallahs.

609
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:12,537
And now you're richer
than they will ever be.

610
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:15,081
What a player.

611
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,291
Ladies and gentlemen,
what a player!

612
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,919
Jamal?

613
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:07,133
God is good, bhai.
God is good.

614
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:26,235
Maman's guys were after us.
We just had to skip.

615
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,654
Liar. Left a message
for you at work.

616
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:31,532
Waited weeks for you at
Nagpur. There was no message.

617
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:33,659
Bhai, I definitely
left a message.

618
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:37,830
There was no message. There was
no message! There was no message!

619
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:44,962
I will never forgive you.

620
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:52,803
I know.

621
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:59,477
<i>That used to be
our slum.</i>

622
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:03,147
Can you believe that, huh?

623
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:06,150
We used to live
right there, man.

624
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:11,280
Now it's all business.

625
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:15,159
India is at the center
of the world hub, bhai.

626
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:17,161
And I-

627
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:19,205
I am at the center...

628
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,540
of the center.

629
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:26,003
This is all Javed-bhai's.

630
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:31,050
- Javed Khan?
- Sorry.

631
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:33,344
<i>The gangster from
our slum? You work for him?</i>

632
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:37,181
Come on. Who else do you think would
save us from Maman's guys, huh?

633
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:39,225
What do you do for him?

634
01:14:41,352 --> 01:14:43,312
Anything he asks.

635
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:54,240
He's coming.
You need to go now.

636
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:57,201
Take my card.
What for?

637
01:14:57,284 --> 01:15:00,413
You think I'm gonna let you
out of my sights again, huh?

638
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,540
You stay with me now,
younger brother.

639
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:05,042
Now go- my place.

640
01:15:05,126 --> 01:15:08,212
Salim, where is Latika?

641
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:10,339
Still?

642
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:18,514
She's gone, Brother.
Long gone. Now go.

643
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:21,142

I am so late for the memsahib.

713

You want to do something
for me? Anything.

714
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:52,718
Then forget me.
What? No.

715
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:54,970
I'll wait...

716
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:59,016

718

So what?

719
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:11,195
It's too late,Jamal.
Now go.

720
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:24,374
<i>So, Jamal, which cricketer
has scored..</i>

721
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:27,377
The most first class
centuries in history?

722
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:29,838
"A," Sachin Tendulkar,

723
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:31,924
"B," Ricky Ponting,

<i>But remember,

727
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:47,356

just like this.

728
01:23:49,816 --> 01:23:52,236

01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:49,014
I don't know the answer.

753
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:52,809
You've
said that before, yeah.

754
01:27:52,893 --> 01:27:56,313
No. Really.
This time I don't.

<i>Come on. You can't take

757
01:28:04,279 --> 01:28:06,865
I don't see what else
I can do.

758
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:09,785
Maybe it's written,
my friend.

759
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:11,787

762

01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:03,773
The question once again:

780
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:11,156
Which cricketer has scored the
most first class centuries in history?

781
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:16,786
I know it isn't Sachin
Tendulkar. That's a start.

782
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:18,872
<i>So it could be
Ricky Ponting,</i>

or Michael Slater.

784
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:27,589
I'll use a lifeline- fifty-fifty.

785
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:31,718
Okay. Computer, take away
two wrong answers, please.

786
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:38,433
Well, you were right
about Sachin Tendulkar.

787
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:41,895
That leaves you a fifty-fifty
choice,Jamal. "B," Ricky Ponting,

788
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:44,689

- And yet- - Because I'm

<i>Most of you are.</i>
