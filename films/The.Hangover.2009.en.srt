1
00:00:47,455 --> 00:00:50,082
You've reached
Doug. Sorry I missed your call.

2
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,417
Please leave a name and number
and I'll get back to you.

3
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:02,844
Hi, you've reached
Dr. Stuart Price with Divine Dentistry.

4
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:05,347
Please leave a message after...

5
00:01:11,813 --> 00:01:13,313
Hey, this is Phil.

6
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:16,525
Leave me a message or don't.
Do me a favor, don't text me. It's gay.

7
00:01:18,152 --> 00:01:19,528
- Anything?
I tried them all.

8
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:21,780
It keeps going straight to voicemail.

9
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,699
Well, there has to be an explanation.

10
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:26,660
Sweetie, it's Vegas.
You lose track of time in casinos.

11
00:01:26,828 --> 00:01:30,205
There's no windows, there's no clocks.
He's probably on a heater.

12
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:34,543
And you never walk away from the table
when you're on a heater.

13
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:36,545
You do if you're getting married.

14
00:01:38,756 --> 00:01:41,008
- Hello?
- Ahem, Tracy, it's Phil.

15
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,218
Phil, where the hell are you guys?

16
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:45,637
I'm freaking out.

17
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,222
Yeah, listen.

18
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,849
Uh...

19
00:01:51,227 --> 00:01:52,394
We fucked up.

20
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:57,482
- What are you talking about?
- The bachelor party, the whole night. It...

21
00:01:57,734 --> 00:02:00,652
Things got out of control, uh...

22
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:04,072
...and we lost Doug.

23
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,992
- What?
- We can't find Doug.

24
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,579
What are you saying, Phil?
We're getting married in five hours.

25
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,873
Yeah.

26
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,168
That's not gonna happen.

27
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:47,217
To my left a little.

28
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:49,010
Thank you.

29
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:50,637
Okey-dokey.

30
00:03:54,809 --> 00:03:57,602
- Whoa, watch it, pervert!
- Alan, he's just doing your inseam.

31
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:03,400
- He's getting very close to my shaft.
- All done. You can change now.

32
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:06,945
Right. Thanks, Floyd.
Thank you very much.

33
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,073
All right, buddy,
we should get a move on.

34
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:14,327
You know, Doug, I was thinking...

35
00:04:14,495 --> 00:04:17,622
If you wanna go to Vegas without me,
that is totally cool, you know?

36
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,541
What are you talking about?

37
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,211
You know, Phil and Stu, they're
your buddies, and it's your bachelor party.

38
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:25,464
Come on, Alan. Those two love you.

39
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:28,550
And also, I don't want you to feel
like you have to hold back...

40
00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:31,136
...because your wife's brother's there.
I just...

41
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,221
It's not like that.

42
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:38,477
It's not like that. I already told you, Alan.

43
00:04:38,644 --> 00:04:42,731
Okay? We're just spending the night
in Vegas. It's no big deal.

44
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:47,068
Besides, you're not just my wife's brother,
you're my brother now.

45
00:04:49,906 --> 00:04:53,283
I want you to know, Doug,
I'm a steel trap.

46
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:57,746
Whatever happens tonight,
I will never, ever, ever, speak a word of it.

47
00:04:57,914 --> 00:05:00,582
Okay. Yeah, I got it. Thank you.
I don't think that...

48
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,710
Seriously. I don't care what happens.

49
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:06,588
- I don't care if we kill someone.
- What?

50
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:09,257
You heard me. It's Sin City.

51
00:05:10,676 --> 00:05:12,677
I won't tell a soul.

52
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,555
Okay. I got it.

53
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:20,727
- Thank you.
No, thank you.

54
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:25,106
I love you so much.

55
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:27,859
- Ha. I knew it.
- Dad.

56
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,569
Oh, stop it, I'm just jerking around.

57
00:05:29,737 --> 00:05:32,405
Alan, put some pants on.
You have weird legs.

58
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:33,615
Yes, Daddy.

59
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:35,659
- His legs look fine, Dad.
- Oh, please.

60
00:05:35,826 --> 00:05:39,663
He has his mother's legs. It's just freaky.

61
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:47,212
Alan, I'm just teasing.
You have wonderful legs.

62
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,507
They're better than your mother's.
They're beautiful.

63
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:53,969
Can you believe this?
Just two more days.

64
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:57,264
I know. You getting nervous?

65
00:05:57,431 --> 00:05:59,766
- You wanna back out?
- Shut up.

66
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:02,185
Just tell me. Oh. Mm.

67
00:06:03,312 --> 00:06:05,981
You know, I don't need to go to Vegas.
It's dumb.

68
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:09,651
It's not dumb. It's one night.
Have fun, you deserve it.

69
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:11,903
I know, but we should have
gone last weekend.

70
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,906
We have so much to do.
L... I'm gonna cancel.

71
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,951
My brother packed his bag two weeks ago.
You're not canceling.

72
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,369
- Really?
- Yeah.

73
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:21,580
- Two weeks?
- Yeah, he's excited.

74
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,666
Thanks again for bringing him,
by the way.

75
00:06:24,834 --> 00:06:27,502
You don't need to thank me,
it's nothing. He's a cool guy.

76
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,838
It's not nothing
and he's not a cool guy...

77
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:32,173
...so thank you.

78
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:34,676
Thank you.

79
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:37,470
Thank you.

80
00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:43,893
Hey, Sid.

81
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:48,356
I just wanted to thank you guys again
for everything you're doing this weekend.

82
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:50,775
- We couldn't be more excited.
- Ah, that's great.

83
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:54,696
Yeah, okay. You love us
and we love you. Terrific.

84
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:56,740
So talk to me about Vegas.

85
00:06:56,907 --> 00:06:59,034
- Uh... It should be pretty mellow.
- Mm-hm.

86
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:02,537
Do some gambling, maybe catch some rays,
have a few laughs.

87
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:05,874
Yeah, some laughs. I got you.

88
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:07,500
How you getting out there?

89
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:10,462
Uh, we're gonna take my car.
Gonna pick up my friends after this.

90
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,049
- Prius? You're taking a Prius to Vegas?
- Yeah.

91
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,885
You know, when you go to Vegas...

92
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:18,386
...you gotta go to Vegas.

93
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:20,639
No. Sid.

94
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:27,687
- Really?
Come on, we're family now.

95
00:07:28,356 --> 00:07:31,983
- You sure? I mean, you love this car.
- Doug, it's just a car.

96
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:36,529
Just make sure to put some Armor All
on the tires so the sand doesn't seep in.

97
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:38,907
Absolutely. That's easy.

98
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:43,662
Oh, and, uh, don't let Alan drive,
because there's something wrong with him.

99
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:44,871
Understood.

100
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,540
Oh, and Phil either. I don't like him.

101
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:52,170
I will be the only one driving this car.
I promise.

102
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,380
Good.

103
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:56,591
Remember, what happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas.

104
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,259
Ah!

105
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:02,972
Except for herpes.
That shit'll come back with you.

106
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,893
All right. Hold on. I still need
some of your permission slips...

107
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:10,522
...and $90 for the field trip
to the Griffith Observatory next weekend.

108
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,693
Pay now, or forever regret missing out
on the experience of a lifetime, guys.

109
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,069
You're good, you got it.

110
00:08:16,237 --> 00:08:18,029
Thanks, Mr. Wenneck.
Thank you. Hey.

111
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,906
You really came through,
thank you.

112
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:23,201
Whoa, Max. What gives?
What, no planetarium?

113
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,620
My mom won't give me the money.
I'm grounded.

114
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:27,914
- Well, how much you got on you?
- I don't know.

115
00:08:28,082 --> 00:08:30,417
Like, 20 bucks.

116
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:32,961
Well, give me the 20
and I'll cover the rest.

117
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:36,715
- Really?
- Yeah. Well, we'll talk about it.

118
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:38,883
But give me the 20
so I know you're serious.

119
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,803
- Cool. Thanks, Mr. Wenneck.
- Yeah.

120
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,491
Hold on, I got it.

121
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:06,327
Ahem, do you have to park so close?

122
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:09,330
- Yeah. What's wrong?
- I shouldn't be here.

123
00:09:09,498 --> 00:09:10,582
Why is that, Alan?

124
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,169
I'm not supposed to be within 200 feet
of a school.

125
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,714
- What?
- Or a Chuck E. Cheese.

126
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:23,261
Mr. Wenneck, I was...
- It's the weekend.

127
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,346
I don't know you. You do not exist.

128
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:28,349
- Shit.
Heh, heh, heh.

129
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:30,185
- Nice car.
Yeah.

130
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:32,020
- I'm driving.
Whoa, no chance, buddy...

131
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:34,272
Don't step... God. Watch the leath...

132
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,233
Shut up and drive before these nerds
ask me another question.

133
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:39,027
- Animal.
- Who's this?

134
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:42,363
- It's Alan. Tracy's brother.
- I met you, like, four times.

135
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:44,824
Oh, yeah. How you doing, man?

136
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:47,368
Don't forget your Rogaine.

137
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,872
Rogaine, check.

138
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,249
And don't forget to use it.

139
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:56,711
I can totally tell when you forget,
your hair just looks thinner.

140
00:09:57,505 --> 00:10:00,423
Using of the Rogaine, check.

141
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:03,134
Make sure to call me
right when you get to the hotel...

142
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,845
...not like that conference in Phoenix.

143
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:08,515
I had to wait two hours
for you to call me.

144
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:11,351
Yeah, I was the keynote speaker.
I was late to the podium.

145
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,729
- Still?
- Yeah, you're totally right. I'm sorry.

146
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,733
- What is the matter?
I don't know.

147
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:21,653
I hope you're not gonna go to
some strip club when you're up there.

148
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,489
Melissa, we're going to Napa Valley.

149
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,283
I don't even think they have strip clubs
in wine country.

150
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:31,412
Well, I'm sure if there is one,
Phil will sniff it out.

151
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,874
It's not gonna be like that.

152
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:36,918
Besides, you know how I feel about that.

153
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:41,005
I know, I know. It's just boys
and their bachelor parties, it's gross.

154
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:45,426
You're right, it is gross. Mm-mm.

155
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:48,721
And you know what else, honestly?

156
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:53,601
Why would I risk this for,
you know, a couple of minutes...

157
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:58,857
...of some 19-year-old hard body
in a schoolgirl outfit?

158
00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:01,192
- Yeah.
- Why would I ever need, like...

159
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,279
- You're right. And if you ever do...
- What?

160
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:06,573
...I will fucking kick your ass.

161
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:11,077
Thank you. Thank you for that.

162
00:11:11,245 --> 00:11:14,622
That is exactly what I needed to hear.

163
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,332
Not to mention it's pathetic.

164
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,961
Those places are filthy.
And the worst part is...

165
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:22,338
...that little girl...

166
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:26,217
...grinding and dry humping
the fucking stage up there...

167
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:30,138
...that's somebody's daughter up there.
- I was just gonna say that.

168
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:33,308
See? I just wish your friends
were as mature as you.

169
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:36,686
They are mature, actually.
You just have to get to know them better.

170
00:11:36,854 --> 00:11:39,689
Paging Dr. Faggot.

171
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:44,319
Dr. Faggot!

172
00:11:46,864 --> 00:11:50,116
- I should go.
- That's a good idea, Dr. Faggot.

173
00:11:51,869 --> 00:11:54,829
Have a good weekend.
I'm gonna miss you.

174
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,842
Whoo!

175
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,386
Road trip!

176
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:15,808
Vegas! Vegas, baby!

177
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:17,060
Vegas!

178
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:20,438
You're nuts!

179
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:27,445
Come on, just till Barstow.
Everybody's passing us.

180
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:32,533
Absolutely not. I promised Sid.
I will be the only one driving this car.

181
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:33,868
Besides, you're drinking.

182
00:12:34,036 --> 00:12:37,205
Oh, what are you, a cop now?
You know I drive great when I'm drunk.

183
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:40,416
True. Don't forget,
Phil was always our designated drunk driver.

184
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:42,961
Yeah. You wanna explain it
to them, Alan?

185
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:46,255
Guys, my dad loves this car
more than he loves me, so, yeah.

186
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:49,676
Aw, whatever. I left my wife and kid
at home so I could go with you guys.

187
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:52,387
- You know how difficult that was?
- That's really sweet.

188
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,514
- Yeah.
- Dude, I was being sarcastic.

189
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:55,765
I fucking hate my life.

190
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:59,268
- I may never go back. I might stay in Vegas.
- Here we go.

191
00:12:59,436 --> 00:13:01,437
Doug, enjoy yourself,
because come Sunday...

192
00:13:01,605 --> 00:13:04,983
...you're gonna start dying
just a little bit every day.

193
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:09,070
Yeah. That's why I've managed
to stay single this whole time, you know?

194
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:12,031
- Oh, really? That's why you're single?
- Yeah.

195
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:14,158
Cool. Good to know.

196
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:17,745
- Am I all right over there, Alan?
- Yeah, you're good.

197
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,001
Aw, Jesus Christ!

198
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:26,004
- Oh, my God!
- That was awesome!

199
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:28,464
That was not awesome.
What's wrong with you?

200
00:13:28,632 --> 00:13:34,429
- That was insane. We almost just died.
- You should have seen your face.

201
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:36,973
- Classic.
- That's funny. Ha-ha.

202
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:38,891
It's not funny.

203
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:59,454
- Boy, you've got a sweet ride there.
- Don't touch it.

204
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:04,208
Don't even look at it. Go on, get out.

205
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,420
You heard me.
Don't look at me, either.

206
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:12,633
Yeah, you better walk on.

207
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:15,970
- He's actually kind of funny.
- Yeah, he means well.

208
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:18,514
I'll hit an old man in public.

209
00:14:18,974 --> 00:14:21,684
Is he all there? Like, mentally?

210
00:14:21,852 --> 00:14:24,979
I think so. He's just an odd guy.
You know, he's kind of weird.

211
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:26,731
- I mean, should we be worried?
- No.

212
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,357
- All right.
- No.

213
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:31,360
Tracy did mention
that we shouldn't let him gamble.

214
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:33,154
Or drink too much.

215
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:37,158
Jesus, he's like a gremlin.
Comes with instructions and shit.

216
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:39,494
And one water.

217
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,829
- All good with Melissa?
- Oh, yeah.

218
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:47,293
Told her we're two hours
outside of wine country, and she bought it.

219
00:14:47,461 --> 00:14:50,505
You think it's strange you've been
in a relationship for years...

220
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:52,298
...and you have to lie about Vegas?

221
00:14:52,466 --> 00:14:55,176
Yeah, I do.
But trust me, it's not worth the fight.

222
00:14:55,344 --> 00:15:00,556
Oh, so you can't go to Vegas but she can
fuck a bellhop on a Carnival Cruise Line?

223
00:15:00,724 --> 00:15:01,766
Hey.

224
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:05,436
Okay, first of all, he was a bartender.

225
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:06,854
And she was wasted.

226
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:11,484
And, if you must know,
he didn't even come inside her.

227
00:15:11,985 --> 00:15:13,194
And you believe that?

228
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:17,949
Uh, yeah, I do believe that,
because she's grossed out by semen.

229
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:19,700
That'll be 32.50.

230
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,037
It's 32.50, you gonna pay for it?

231
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:30,336
It says here we should work in teams.
Who wants to be my spotter?

232
00:15:30,504 --> 00:15:34,173
I don't think you should be doing
too much gambling tonight, Alan.

233
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:36,300
Gambling?
Who said anything about gambling?

234
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,719
It's not gambling
when you know you're gonna win.

235
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:40,763
Counting cards is a foolproof system.

236
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:42,473
It's also illegal.

237
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:47,270
It's not illegal, it's frowned upon,
like masturbating on an airplane.

238
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:50,857
I'm pretty sure that's illegal too.

239
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:54,277
Yeah, maybe after 9/11,
where everybody got so sensitive.

240
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,905
Thanks a lot, Bin Laden.

241
00:15:59,908 --> 00:16:03,161
Either way, you gotta be super smart
to count cards, buddy, okay?

242
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:04,579
Oh, really?
- It's not easy.

243
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:06,831
Well maybe we should tell that
to Rain Man...

244
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:10,084
...because he practically bankrupted
a casino, and he was a retard.

245
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:11,419
What?

246
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,254
He was a retard.

247
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:15,339
Retard.

248
00:16:56,173 --> 00:16:57,965
Here we go.

249
00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:01,177
Hi, welcome to Caesars.

250
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:02,553
Hello.
Checking in?

251
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,097
Yeah. We have a reservation
under Dr. Price.

252
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:07,475
Okay, let me look that up for you.

253
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:08,768
Dr. Price?

254
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:12,897
Stu, you're a dentist, okay?
Don't try and get fancy.

255
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:17,485
- It's not fancy if it's true.
- He's a dentist. Don't get too excited.

256
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:20,571
And if, uh, someone has a heart attack,
you should still call 911.

257
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,448
We'll be sure to do that.

258
00:17:22,616 --> 00:17:25,993
Can I ask you a question?
Do you know if the hotel's pager-friendly?

259
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:29,038
- What do you mean?
- I'm not getting a sig on my beeper.

260
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:32,500
- I'm not sure.
Is there a payphone bank?

261
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:35,670
Bunch of payphones? Business.

262
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,381
Um, there's a phone in your room.

263
00:17:39,424 --> 00:17:40,466
That'll work.

264
00:17:41,134 --> 00:17:44,512
So I have you in a two-bedroom suite
on the 12th floor, is that okay?

265
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,972
It sounds perfect.

266
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:48,516
Actually, I was wondering
if you had any villas.

267
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:51,269
- We're not even gonna be in the room.
- It's unnecessary.

268
00:17:51,436 --> 00:17:53,562
No big deal. We can share beds.
It's one night.

269
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,773
If we're share beds,
I'm bunking with Phil.

270
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:58,776
- You good with that?
- No, I'm not.

271
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:02,363
Guys, we are not sharing beds.
What are we, 12 years old?

272
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:04,532
Lisa, I apologize.
How much is the villa?

273
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,660
Well, we have one villa available,
and it's 4200 for the night.

274
00:18:07,828 --> 00:18:09,954
- Is it awesome?
- It's pretty awesome.

275
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:14,333
- We'll take it. Give her your credit card.
- I can't give her my credit card.

276
00:18:14,501 --> 00:18:17,962
- We'll split it.
- Are you crazy? No, this is on us.

277
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:22,300
You don't get it.
Melissa checks my statements.

278
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,093
We just need a credit card on file.

279
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:27,346
We won't charge you until check out,
so you can figure it out then.

280
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:31,017
That's perfect. Thank you, Lisa.
We'll deal with it tomorrow. Come on.

281
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,644
Fine.

282
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:36,397
- Can I ask you another question?
Sure.

283
00:18:36,565 --> 00:18:37,857
You probably get this a lot.

284
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:40,234
This isn't the real Caesars Palace,
is it?

285
00:18:40,736 --> 00:18:41,777
What do you mean?

286
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,488
Did, uh...

287
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:48,534
- Did Caesar live here?
- Um, no.

288
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:51,370
I didn't think so.

289
00:19:00,088 --> 00:19:02,048
Holy shit.

290
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:05,051
Now, this is Vegas.

291
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:09,764
Oh, my... This place is enormous.

292
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:11,015
Now we're talking.

293
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,060
Is this all one suite?

294
00:19:14,895 --> 00:19:16,395
Thank you, guys.

295
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:18,439
Or should I say, "Thank you, Stu"?

296
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:20,691
You're welcome.
It's only because I love you.

297
00:19:22,152 --> 00:19:25,696
Hey, guys. Look, free almonds.

298
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,324
- Oh, no, no, no. Please put those back.
- Wait, I'm just hungry.

299
00:19:28,492 --> 00:19:31,452
- Well, I know, but...
- Stu, what the fuck?

300
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,831
It's a pressure-sensitive plate. When you pick
it up, you have 30 seconds to put it back...

301
00:19:35,999 --> 00:19:38,000
...or they bill you.
That's pretty neat.

302
00:19:38,168 --> 00:19:40,628
It may be neat,
but it's also very expensive, so...

303
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:43,089
Those almonds are probably, like, $14.

304
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:45,132
Stu, relax.

305
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,636
Phil, Melissa is like
a forensic accountant, okay?

306
00:19:48,804 --> 00:19:50,971
She scours my statements.
If you want nuts...

307
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:54,141
...put your own credit card down.
- Watch this.

308
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:59,605
Problem solved.
Alan, enjoy your almonds.

309
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:02,149
I don't want them. He ruined it.

310
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:07,238
All right, let's pick a room, let's get
dressed. Be ready in 30 minutes.

311
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:12,660
I just wish you could see this place,
because you, of all people, would love it.

312
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:16,163
Yeah. No, it's so quaint.

313
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:19,375
Yeah, no, there's no TVs, no phones.

314
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:23,629
They just have these cute little antique
radios in all the rooms.

315
00:20:23,797 --> 00:20:25,423
Yeah.

316
00:20:26,383 --> 00:20:28,008
What else? Um...

317
00:20:28,552 --> 00:20:30,845
We met the, uh, proprietor.

318
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:33,389
- Oh, I bet you...
What's his name?

319
00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:34,849
Um, Caesar. Palacé.

320
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,518
Yeah, like the salad.

321
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:42,106
Okay. Well, listen, I gotta go,
because we're gonna hit this wine tasting.

322
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:46,527
Wait, wait. I love you. Okay. Bye.

323
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,780
I'm not even gonna say anything,
it's so embarrassing.

324
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,199
- Where's Alan?
- He, uh, he went downstairs.

325
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:54,368
He said he had to grab a few things.

326
00:20:54,536 --> 00:20:59,707
Good, because I have something
to show you.

327
00:21:01,251 --> 00:21:02,543
Uh-Oh.

328
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:04,712
- What the hell is that?
What do you think?

329
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,090
If it's what I think it is,
I think it's a big fucking mistake.

330
00:21:08,675 --> 00:21:11,886
I'm gonna propose to Melissa
at your wedding. After the ceremony.

331
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:15,556
- Stuey, congratulations!
- Thank you, Doug.

332
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:18,726
- That's a beautiful ring.
- Yeah. It's my grandmother's.

333
00:21:18,894 --> 00:21:21,854
She made it all the way through
the Holocaust with that thing.

334
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:24,899
Wait, have you not listened
to anything I have ever said?

335
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:28,486
Phil, we've been dating for three years.
It's time. This is how it works.

336
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:31,906
A, that is bullshit.
And B, she is a complete bitch.

337
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:34,241
Hey, that's his fiancée.

338
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:37,870
What? It's true. It's true.
You know it's true. She beats him.

339
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:40,998
That was twice, and I was out of line.

340
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,584
She's strong-willed. And I respect that.

341
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:45,586
Wow. Wow.

342
00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:48,631
He's in denial.
Not to mention, she fucked a sailor.

343
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:50,090
Hey, he wasn't a sailor.

344
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:53,677
He was a bartender on a cruise ship.
You know that.

345
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:58,140
Guys, I'm standing right here.
So I can hear everything that you're saying.

346
00:21:58,308 --> 00:22:00,434
Hey, guys. You ready to let the dogs out?

347
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:02,102
- What?
- Do what?

348
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,604
Let the dogs out. You know.

349
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:07,775
Who brought this guy?

350
00:22:07,943 --> 00:22:10,194
Yes, Alan, we are ready
to let the dogs out.

351
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:13,280
- Hey, congrats.
- Thank you.

352
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:27,127
I love this fucking town.

353
00:22:34,636 --> 00:22:37,304
- You're not really wearing that, are you?
- Wearing what?

354
00:22:37,472 --> 00:22:39,348
The man-purse.

355
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:42,476
You're actually gonna wear that
or are you guys fucking with me?

356
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:45,771
It's where I keep all my things.
I get a lot of compliments on this.

357
00:22:45,939 --> 00:22:48,190
Plus, it's not a man-purse.
It's called a satchel.

358
00:22:48,358 --> 00:22:49,483
Indiana Jones wears one.

359
00:22:50,735 --> 00:22:51,986
So does Joy Behar.

360
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,908
- We're going up, guys.
- Yeah, that's perfect.

361
00:22:58,076 --> 00:22:59,743
Really?

362
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,537
We're going up?

363
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,086
I'm just saying,
it's clearly marked, okay?

364
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,338
We are definitely
not supposed to be up here.

365
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:14,758
Come on, we're paying for a villa.
We can do whatever the fuck we want.

366
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,927
- Yeah, but...
- Just wedge the door open.

367
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:19,388
- Guys, come on up here.
- Fine.

368
00:23:23,226 --> 00:23:25,728
How the hell did you find this place?

369
00:23:25,895 --> 00:23:27,396
Don't worry about it.

370
00:23:27,564 --> 00:23:29,148
Oh!

371
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:31,525
- You all right?
- Yeah.

372
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:35,195
- Look at the view up here.
- You happy?

373
00:23:35,363 --> 00:23:36,614
- This is great.
- Whoa!

374
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:39,033
Are you kidding?

375
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,577
Alan, how we doing, buddy?
- Good.

376
00:23:41,745 --> 00:23:44,538
What do you got over there, Alan?
That's the Eiffel Tower.

377
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:46,749
Uh-oh.

378
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:48,626
- Right?
- A little Jägermeister.

379
00:23:48,793 --> 00:23:50,419
- Good idea.
- There it is. Good call.

380
00:23:50,587 --> 00:23:51,670
On the roof.

381
00:23:51,838 --> 00:23:55,758
Um, no, this is good.
I'd like to make a toast.

382
00:23:55,925 --> 00:23:57,885
To Doug and Tracy.

383
00:23:58,053 --> 00:24:00,846
May tonight be...

384
00:24:01,097 --> 00:24:03,307
...but a minor speed bump...

385
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,143
...in an otherwise very long
and healthy marriage.

386
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,728
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

387
00:24:07,896 --> 00:24:08,937
Short and sweet.

388
00:24:12,275 --> 00:24:13,525
Oh, it's like college.

389
00:24:13,693 --> 00:24:16,111
- All right. I wanna talk about something.
All right.

390
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,571
- I want to...
I'd like to...

391
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:20,783
I'd like to say something...

392
00:24:21,743 --> 00:24:23,577
...that I prepared...

393
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:26,455
...tonight.
- All right, Alan.

394
00:24:30,752 --> 00:24:32,336
"Hello.

395
00:24:33,797 --> 00:24:35,839
How about that ride in?

396
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,092
I guess that's why they call it
Sin City.

397
00:24:40,553 --> 00:24:45,474
You guys might not know this,
but I consider myself a bit of a loner.

398
00:24:45,642 --> 00:24:48,852
I tend to think of myself
as a one-man wolf pack.

399
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:54,108
But when my sister brought Doug home,
I knew he was one of my own.

400
00:24:55,151 --> 00:24:58,904
And my wolf pack, it grew by one.

401
00:24:59,072 --> 00:25:01,865
So were there two...
So there were two of us in the wolf pack.

402
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:06,328
I was alone first in the pack,
and then Doug joined in later.

403
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:08,914
And six months ago...

404
00:25:09,082 --> 00:25:12,126
...when Doug introduced me to you guys,
I thought:

405
00:25:12,293 --> 00:25:16,296
'Wait a second. Could it be? '
And now, I know for sure.

406
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:19,091
I just added two more guys
to my wolf pack. "

407
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:21,468
- All right.
- All right.

408
00:25:21,636 --> 00:25:23,178
"Four of us wolves...

409
00:25:23,346 --> 00:25:27,266
...running around the desert together
in Las Vegas...

410
00:25:27,434 --> 00:25:29,893
...looking for strippers and cocaine. "

411
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:31,103
So tonight...

412
00:25:32,272 --> 00:25:33,313
...I make a toast.
- Whoa.

413
00:25:33,481 --> 00:25:35,357
- What...?
- What do you got there?

414
00:25:35,525 --> 00:25:37,985
Dude, what the fuck?
What the hell are you doing?

415
00:25:41,906 --> 00:25:44,658
- What is that?
- Blood brothers.

416
00:25:44,826 --> 00:25:46,326
- Don't... Why did you...?
- Damn it.

417
00:25:46,494 --> 00:25:47,619
- Here.
- Alan...

418
00:25:47,787 --> 00:25:49,329
- No.
- No, I'm not doing that.

419
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:51,039
Go ahead, Stuart.
- Make him stop.

420
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:53,751
Alan, we're not gonna cut ourselves.
Give me the knife.

421
00:25:53,918 --> 00:25:56,670
Slowly. Thank you.
Okay. Thank you very much.

422
00:25:56,838 --> 00:25:58,672
You all right? Are you okay?
Mm-hm.

423
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,507
- Do you need a doctor?
- He's good.

424
00:26:00,675 --> 00:26:01,842
You sure?
I'm good.

425
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,803
All right, good,
because I need everybody to focus.

426
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:08,807
I wanna take a moment, I wanna talk
about some... I wanna talk about memory.

427
00:26:08,975 --> 00:26:11,852
No, better yet,
I wanna talk about selective memory.

428
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:17,191
You see, whatever happens here tonight
may as well never have happened at all...

429
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:20,694
...because this circle's about as far
as it's ever gonna go.

430
00:26:20,862 --> 00:26:24,490
In other words, forget everything.

431
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:27,493
Doug, I'm serious. I got a wife and kid.

432
00:26:28,578 --> 00:26:32,372
Okay, good or bad, we don't remember
so we got nothing to talk about.

433
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,375
Nothing, guys. Nothing.

434
00:26:35,877 --> 00:26:37,461
Deal?

435
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:39,296
- Deal.
Deal.

436
00:26:40,006 --> 00:26:43,884
- Perfect. Alan, come here, buddy.
Get in here, crazy.

437
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:48,430
All right, to a night
we'll never remember...

438
00:26:50,266 --> 00:26:53,143
...but the four of us
will never forget.

439
00:26:57,899 --> 00:26:59,233
There it is.
Hear, hear.

440
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,401
Hey, thanks, guys.

441
00:29:26,255 --> 00:29:27,381
Hm.

442
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:29,716
Stupid tiger.

443
00:29:36,432 --> 00:29:38,183
What the fuck?

444
00:29:39,352 --> 00:29:42,229
Control yourself, man.
Goddamn, will you put on some pants?

445
00:29:42,397 --> 00:29:45,315
- Phil, do not go in the bathroom.
- Al, just calm down. It's me.

446
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,901
Phil, there is a tiger in the bathroom.

447
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:50,737
- What's going on?
- There's a jungle cat in the bathroom!

448
00:29:50,905 --> 00:29:53,407
- Okay, okay, Al. Al, I'll check it out.
Don't go in.

449
00:29:53,574 --> 00:29:56,368
Don't go in, don't go in.
Be careful. Don't, don't.

450
00:29:58,246 --> 00:30:00,872
- Oh! Holy fuck! He's not kidding.
See? See?

451
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,333
- There's a tiger in there.
- No, there isn't.

452
00:30:03,543 --> 00:30:04,876
Yeah!

453
00:30:05,044 --> 00:30:08,547
- It's big. Gigantic.
- You okay, buddy?

454
00:30:08,715 --> 00:30:11,258
No. I am in so much pain right now.

455
00:30:11,426 --> 00:30:14,845
Goddamn. Look at this place.

456
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,054
Whew.

457
00:30:16,222 --> 00:30:20,559
I know. Phil, they have my credit card
downstairs. I am so screwed.

458
00:30:20,727 --> 00:30:23,395
How does a tiger get in the bathroom?
It almost killed me.

459
00:30:23,563 --> 00:30:25,439
Hey, bro?
You mind putting on some pants?

460
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:27,649
I find it a little weird
I have to ask twice.

461
00:30:27,817 --> 00:30:30,444
Pants at a time like this?
I don't have any p...

462
00:30:31,654 --> 00:30:33,864
What the fuck happened last night?

463
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:37,367
Hey, Phil, am I missing a tooth?

464
00:30:37,744 --> 00:30:40,829
I can't... Oh, shit.

465
00:30:43,124 --> 00:30:45,667
Oh, my God.

466
00:30:45,835 --> 00:30:47,794
My lateral incisor's... It's gone!

467
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:52,215
It's okay. Okay, okay. Just calm down.
We're fine. Everything's fine.

468
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:53,633
Alan, go wake up Doug.

469
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:57,637
Let's get some coffee and get the fuck
out of Nevada before housekeeping shows.

470
00:30:57,805 --> 00:31:01,391
What am I gonna tell Melissa? I lost a tooth.
I have no idea how it happened.

471
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,851
You're freaking me out, man.

472
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:05,479
I got a massive headache, okay?
Let's just calm down.

473
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:08,231
How am I supposed to calm down?
Look around you.

474
00:31:08,691 --> 00:31:11,610
- Hey, guys, he's not in there.
- Did you check all the rooms?

475
00:31:11,778 --> 00:31:14,446
Yeah, I looked everywhere.
Plus, his mattress is gone.

476
00:31:14,614 --> 00:31:17,032
He probably went to the pool
to get something to eat.

477
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,658
I'll just call his cell.

478
00:31:20,036 --> 00:31:22,287
I look like a nerdy hillbilly.

479
00:31:35,802 --> 00:31:37,594
- Hello?
- Alan.

480
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:39,012
Hey.

481
00:31:39,972 --> 00:31:42,516
- It's Phil.
- Oh, hey, Phi...

482
00:31:43,184 --> 00:31:45,185
This is Doug's phone.
This is Doug's phone.

483
00:31:45,353 --> 00:31:46,353
No shit.
- Yeah.

484
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:53,568
What the fuck is that?

485
00:32:00,034 --> 00:32:01,660
Whose fucking baby is that?

486
00:32:01,828 --> 00:32:04,538
Alan, are you sure you didn't see
anyone else in the suite?

487
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:06,748
Yeah, I checked all the rooms.
No one's here.

488
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:09,209
Check its collar or something.

489
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:11,253
Shh. Shh.

490
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,047
- It's okay, baby.
- Stu, we don't have time for this.

491
00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:16,883
Let's go hook up with Doug,
we'll deal with the baby later.

492
00:32:17,051 --> 00:32:19,219
Phil, we're not gonna leave a baby
in the room.

493
00:32:19,387 --> 00:32:22,222
- There's a fucking tiger in the bathroom.
- It's not our baby.

494
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,307
Yeah, I gotta side with Stu on this one.

495
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,560
All right, fine.
Okay, we'll take it with us.

496
00:32:26,727 --> 00:32:28,895
Could you at least just find some pants?

497
00:32:36,362 --> 00:32:40,157
Why can't we remember a goddamn thing
from last night?

498
00:32:40,324 --> 00:32:43,952
Because we obviously
had a great fucking time.

499
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:47,747
Why don't you just stop worrying
for one minute?

500
00:32:47,915 --> 00:32:49,249
Be proud of yourself.

501
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:53,545
I don't know, Phil.
Maybe it's because I'm missing a tooth.

502
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:58,884
Or maybe it's because
there's a tiger in our hotel room...

503
00:32:59,051 --> 00:33:02,596
...which, incidentally,
is completely destroyed.

504
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:06,224
Oh, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, I know.

505
00:33:06,392 --> 00:33:11,104
Maybe it's because we found a baby,
a human baby.

506
00:33:11,272 --> 00:33:12,981
That's it. That's it.

507
00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:17,110
It's because we found a fucking baby.

508
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:21,781
- You shouldn't curse around the child.
- Really? You shouldn't be around a child.

509
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:30,790
Oh, how cute. What's his name?

510
00:33:33,127 --> 00:33:35,754
- Ben.
- Carlos.

511
00:33:37,131 --> 00:33:38,840
Carlos?

512
00:33:49,185 --> 00:33:50,769
Thank you.

513
00:33:55,816 --> 00:33:56,983
Hey, Phil, look.

514
00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:03,448
He's jacking his little weenis.

515
00:34:03,991 --> 00:34:07,327
- Pull yourself together, man.
- Not at the table, Carlos.

516
00:34:12,124 --> 00:34:13,375
I looked everywhere.

517
00:34:13,542 --> 00:34:16,795
Gym, casino, front desk.
Nobody's seen Doug. He's not here.

518
00:34:16,963 --> 00:34:18,421
He's fine. He's a grown man.

519
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:21,675
Seriously, Stu, you gotta calm down.
Here, have some juice.

520
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:27,931
I can't have juice right now.

521
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:30,684
Okay. All right.
Let's just track this thing.

522
00:34:32,186 --> 00:34:34,521
What's the last thing
we remember doing last night?

523
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:36,856
Well, the first thing was
we were on the roof...

524
00:34:37,024 --> 00:34:38,650
...and were having those shots of Jäger.

525
00:34:41,153 --> 00:34:43,154
And then we ate dinner
at The Palm. Right?

526
00:34:43,322 --> 00:34:44,364
That's right.

527
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:48,201
And then we played craps at
the Hard Rock, and I think Doug was there.

528
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:50,620
That sounds right.
No, no. He definitely was.

529
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,623
You know what, guys?
I don't even remember going to dinner.

530
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:56,626
What the fuck?
I don't think I've ever been this hung-over.

531
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,045
After the Hard Rock, I blacked out.
It was like emptiness.

532
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:02,841
Okay. We have up until 10 p. M...

533
00:35:03,009 --> 00:35:06,261
...so that gives us a 12-hour window
where we could have lost him.

534
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:10,432
What is this?
- Oh, my God. That is my tooth.

535
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:13,643
Why do you have that?
What else is in your pockets?

536
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:16,896
This is a good thing. No.
Check your pockets. Check your pockets.

537
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:18,565
Do you have anything?

538
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:21,818
I have an ATM receipt
from the Bellagio.

539
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:28,366
Eleven-oh-five for $800!
I am so fucked.

540
00:35:28,534 --> 00:35:32,746
I have a valet ticket from Caesars.
Looks like we got in at 5:15 a. m.

541
00:35:32,913 --> 00:35:34,914
Oh, shit. We drove last night?

542
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:38,126
Driving drunk. Classic.

543
00:35:41,505 --> 00:35:43,256
What's on your arm?

544
00:35:44,508 --> 00:35:46,176
- What the fuck is that?
- Jesus, Phil.

545
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,220
- You were in the hospital last night.
- I guess so, yeah.

546
00:35:49,388 --> 00:35:51,765
- You okay?
- Yeah, Alan. I'm fine.

547
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:53,767
What the hell is going on?

548
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:56,561
Well, Stu, Stu, this is a good thing.
We have a lead now.

549
00:35:56,729 --> 00:35:58,229
Hey, Stu, watch this.

550
00:36:02,443 --> 00:36:05,570
- You ever seen a baby do that?
- Dude, Alan, not cool.

551
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:13,078
So, uh, are you sure you're qualified
to be taking care of that baby?

552
00:36:13,245 --> 00:36:15,121
What? I've found a baby before.

553
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:17,582
- You found a baby before?
- Yeah.

554
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,459
- Where?
- Coffee Bean.

555
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:22,337
Wait, what?

556
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:25,632
Hey, Phil? I don't think Doug
would want us to take the Mercedes.

557
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,883
Relax, we'll be careful.

558
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:29,636
My dad is crazy about that car.
He left Doug in charge...

559
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:32,055
Alan. We got bigger problems here.

560
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,140
Doug could be in the hospital,
he could be hurt.

561
00:36:35,601 --> 00:36:39,104
- Let's worry about the car later.
- Uh, guys? Check it out.

562
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:44,901
All right, grab it from the other side.

563
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:47,070
Is that the mattress from Doug's room?

564
00:36:47,613 --> 00:36:49,656
What the fuck?

565
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,992
Hey, man, what's going on here?

566
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,496
Some asshole threw his bed
out the window last night.

567
00:36:56,664 --> 00:36:58,998
- No shit.
- Yeah.

568
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,167
Some guys just can't handle Vegas.

569
00:37:02,711 --> 00:37:03,753
Ha-ha.

570
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:06,714
Oh, God.

571
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:08,675
It's gonna be okay, Stu.

572
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:12,053
How the hell did we manage that?

573
00:37:15,683 --> 00:37:18,935
- Here's your car, officers.
- Oh, God.

574
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:21,980
All right, everybody act cool.
All right, don't say a word.

575
00:37:22,148 --> 00:37:25,442
Come on, let's just get in and go.
Come on.

576
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:30,029
- Stu, you got a five?
No.

577
00:37:30,906 --> 00:37:33,366
I'll hit you on the way back.
Thank you, sir.

578
00:37:33,534 --> 00:37:35,952
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

579
00:37:37,371 --> 00:37:39,706
You just nailed the baby.

580
00:37:39,874 --> 00:37:40,874
Are my glasses okay?

581
00:37:41,667 --> 00:37:44,419
Your glasses are fine, dick.

582
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:52,093
This is so illegal.

583
00:37:52,636 --> 00:37:54,512
Can't you see the fun part in anything?

584
00:37:55,764 --> 00:37:58,224
Yeah, we're stuck in traffic
in a stolen police car...

585
00:37:58,392 --> 00:38:00,393
...with a missing child
in the back seat.

586
00:38:00,561 --> 00:38:02,061
Which part of this is fun?

587
00:38:02,855 --> 00:38:07,066
- I think the cop-car part's pretty cool.
- Thank you, Alan. It is cool.

588
00:38:07,234 --> 00:38:09,068
Doug would love it.

589
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,571
Come on.

590
00:38:14,408 --> 00:38:17,076
- Check this out.
Oh, no. No, Phil. No, Phil.

591
00:38:17,244 --> 00:38:18,244
Don't do this!

592
00:38:18,412 --> 00:38:20,747
Take it easy.
- Just try to call more attention to us.

593
00:38:20,915 --> 00:38:22,248
Attention.
- Sorry.

594
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:24,375
Attention, please. Move out of the way.

595
00:38:24,543 --> 00:38:26,044
I repeat, please disperse.

596
00:38:28,297 --> 00:38:32,050
Phil, stop the car, I wanna get out.
Stop the car, I wanna get out. Pull over.

597
00:38:32,218 --> 00:38:36,596
Ma'am, in the leopard dress,
you have an amazing rack.

598
00:38:37,556 --> 00:38:39,891
Get off the sidewalk!
Get off the sidewalk!

599
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:41,518
I should have been a fucking cop.

600
00:38:48,275 --> 00:38:49,609
Look, I already told you.

601
00:38:49,777 --> 00:38:52,946
You came in with a mild concussion,
some bruised ribs. No big deal.

602
00:38:53,113 --> 00:38:55,615
Although none of you could articulate
how it happened.

603
00:38:55,783 --> 00:38:58,243
Do you remember how many of us
were here?

604
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,702
Ah...

605
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:03,456
I don't know. I think it was just you guys.
Definitely no baby.

606
00:39:03,624 --> 00:39:07,252
- And one other guy.
- That's our guy. Was he okay?

607
00:39:07,419 --> 00:39:11,464
Yeah. He was fine.
Just whacked out of his mind. You all were.

608
00:39:11,632 --> 00:39:15,301
All right, come forward.
And turn.

609
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:16,469
All right.

610
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:19,847
There you go. And cough.

611
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:24,894
Cough. Cough. Give me one more.

612
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:28,231
All right. Thattaboy.

613
00:39:29,275 --> 00:39:31,067
Okay, Felix, you can put your robe on.

614
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,361
And the nurse will be in here
in a minute.

615
00:39:33,529 --> 00:39:35,655
I'll see you after the weekend.

616
00:39:35,823 --> 00:39:38,741
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, doctor.

617
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:44,581
Guys, I really gotta go. I'm sorry.
I have a surgery up on the fourth floor.

618
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:48,585
No, I know. But we just need
a couple more minutes of your time.

619
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:55,425
Yeah. Tuck it right in there.
I don't want to re-sterilize.

620
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,260
Walk with me.

621
00:39:59,555 --> 00:40:04,892
Okay, here we go. Patient name,
Phil Wenneck, 2:45 a. m. Arrival.

622
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,937
Minor concussion, like I said.
Some bruising. Pretty standard.

623
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,189
Do you mind if I look?
I'm actually a doctor.

624
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:14,819
Yeah, you said that several times last night.
But really, you're just a dentist.

625
00:40:15,571 --> 00:40:19,991
Okay, this is interesting.
Your blood work came in this morning.

626
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,868
Wow.

627
00:40:22,786 --> 00:40:25,955
They found a large amount of Ruphylin
in your system.

628
00:40:26,373 --> 00:40:29,959
Ruphylin. Roofies.
Commonly known as the date-rape drug.

629
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,879
What, so, what are you saying,
I was raped last night?

630
00:40:33,672 --> 00:40:35,214
Actually...

631
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:42,513
I don't think so.
But someone did slip you the drug.

632
00:40:42,681 --> 00:40:44,223
I'm not surprised
you don't remember anything.

633
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:48,895
Doc, none of us can remember anything
from last night. Remember?

634
00:40:49,938 --> 00:40:52,315
Yeah. How could someone
have drugged all of us?

635
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:53,691
I wouldn't worry about it.

636
00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:56,569
The stuff's out of your system.
You're gonna be fine.

637
00:40:56,737 --> 00:40:59,447
Wait, wait, wait. Please, doctor.
Is there anything else?

638
00:40:59,615 --> 00:41:03,951
Like, something we may have been talking
about, or some place we were going?

639
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:05,912
Actually, there was something.

640
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,498
You guys kept talking about some wedding
last night.

641
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:11,292
Yeah. No shit. Our buddy Doug's
getting married tomorrow.

642
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,795
- You know what? I want the 100 back.
- No, no. Easy.

643
00:41:13,962 --> 00:41:16,506
You kept talking about some wedding
you just came from.

644
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,007
At the, uh, Best Little Chapel.

645
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:21,636
You kept saying how sick the wedding was
and getting all crazy about it.

646
00:41:21,804 --> 00:41:24,013
Okay, I hope this helps.
I really have to leave.

647
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,557
Best Little Chapel,
do you know where that is?

648
00:41:26,725 --> 00:41:30,561
I do. It's at the corner of Get A Map
and Fuck Off.

649
00:41:32,564 --> 00:41:34,440
I'm a doctor, not a tour guide.

650
00:41:34,608 --> 00:41:37,777
Figure it out yourself, okay?
You're big boys.

651
00:41:49,915 --> 00:41:50,957
What about the baby?

652
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:53,376
Leave him in the car.
We're gonna be five minutes.

653
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:55,378
Whoa, we're not leaving a baby in the car.

654
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:58,214
He'll be fine. I cracked the window.

655
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:05,304
- What if they don't remember us?
- Well, let's just find out.

656
00:42:07,141 --> 00:42:08,850
I'm sor... Excuse me, sir? Hi.

657
00:42:11,145 --> 00:42:12,478
Look at these guys.

658
00:42:12,646 --> 00:42:15,732
What happened? You miss me?
You miss Eddie? You want more from me?

659
00:42:15,899 --> 00:42:19,235
How are you, my friend?
Look at this guy. You're fucking crazy.

660
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:20,445
What's going on, man?

661
00:42:20,946 --> 00:42:24,323
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something.
I know some sick people in my life.

662
00:42:24,491 --> 00:42:29,162
This guy is the craziest, wildest bastard
I ever met in my life, man.

663
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:31,164
- This guy?
- This guy is out of his mind.

664
00:42:31,331 --> 00:42:33,833
What's going on,
you fucking crazy motherfucker?

665
00:42:34,001 --> 00:42:36,127
I thought he was gonna eat my dick.

666
00:42:36,295 --> 00:42:38,838
What happened?
No love for Eddie? You don't hug me?

667
00:42:39,006 --> 00:42:41,090
No, no. It's not that, Eddie.

668
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:45,678
Uh, it's just that we're having a hard time
remembering what happened here last night.

669
00:42:45,846 --> 00:42:48,431
Yeah, was there a wedding here?
Do you do weddings here?

670
00:42:50,225 --> 00:42:51,851
You are cracking my balls, man.

671
00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:55,188
I love these guys.
Zolea, what are you doing?

672
00:42:55,355 --> 00:42:57,899
Bring my friends some tea,
some baklava, huh? Come on.

673
00:42:58,066 --> 00:43:01,861
Unbelievable, man. Look at this chick.
Beautiful ass, no fucking brain.

674
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:05,281
But this is Vegas. You want intimacy,
forget it. You're gonna get sex.

675
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:07,784
That's it here, man.
No problem for me, though.

676
00:43:07,951 --> 00:43:10,203
You want chicks?
I can get you beautiful chicks...

677
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,205
...from the Eastern Bloc. No questions.

678
00:43:12,372 --> 00:43:15,666
Clean, tight.
The tits like that, the nipple like that.

679
00:43:15,876 --> 00:43:18,544
Obviously we were here.
We're looking for our friend Doug.

680
00:43:18,712 --> 00:43:21,214
- Do you remember?
- Yeah, the small guy. Like a monkey.

681
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:22,548
- Yeah.
- You saw him?

682
00:43:22,716 --> 00:43:23,716
Of course.

683
00:43:23,884 --> 00:43:27,470
Is there anything you can tell us about
what may have happened last night?

684
00:43:29,264 --> 00:43:30,890
You don't remember nothing?

685
00:43:34,686 --> 00:43:38,731
- Congratulations, Stu, you got married.
- This... This can't be happening.

686
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:42,068
- Oh, God.
Look at that.

687
00:43:46,073 --> 00:43:49,450
I'll tell you one thing,
you look seriously happy here, man.

688
00:43:50,202 --> 00:43:52,078
That's it. My life is over.

689
00:43:52,246 --> 00:43:53,996
Stu, it's okay. Look, shit happens.

690
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,666
Come on. Melissa's not gonna know
anything about this.

691
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,919
- This never happened. I'll take care of it.
- Come on. Put it here.

692
00:44:00,087 --> 00:44:01,087
Hey, what's all that?

693
00:44:01,255 --> 00:44:05,258
The High Roller package.
It's what you ordered. I have coffee mugs.

694
00:44:05,425 --> 00:44:07,593
- What?
You have baseball caps, huh?

695
00:44:07,761 --> 00:44:11,180
And fancy calendars, all with pictures
of Stu and Jade.

696
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:12,431
Her name's Jade?

697
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:15,852
Yeah, and she's beautiful, man.
Clean, very tight. Tits like that.

698
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:18,771
- But that's because she had a baby.
That explains the baby.

699
00:44:18,939 --> 00:44:21,107
- Oh, Carlos. Carlos.
- Great. All right.

700
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:23,401
Uh, here's the deal.
We made a mistake last night.

701
00:44:23,569 --> 00:44:25,820
We need this marriage annulled.
You do annulments?

702
00:44:25,988 --> 00:44:28,739
Of course I do. It breaks my heart
and gonna make me sad...

703
00:44:28,907 --> 00:44:30,867
...but it's no problem.
Good price for you.

704
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:34,745
I can't do it with just him, though.
I need the chick. I need both parties.

705
00:44:34,913 --> 00:44:37,456
Oh, not a problem. That's great.
Isn't that great, Stu?

706
00:44:37,624 --> 00:44:39,959
Come on, buddy.
She probably knows where Doug is.

707
00:44:40,127 --> 00:44:42,879
- Awesome.
- All right, all right. Okay. Uh...

708
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:46,465
We need her address.
She filled out some paperwork, right?

709
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:47,633
Of course.

710
00:44:47,801 --> 00:44:51,637
Hey. Excuse me. What is the matter
with you? Go and get the paperwork, man.

711
00:44:51,805 --> 00:44:54,640
- I spend my life waiting for you. Come on.
- Okay. I'm going.

712
00:44:54,808 --> 00:44:57,018
And get the baklava, please.

713
00:45:01,148 --> 00:45:05,359
- Hey, Phil, what about my dad's car?
- I'm sure Doug has it. We'll get it back.

714
00:45:05,527 --> 00:45:08,529
Then I vote we torch the cop car
and all this shit with it.

715
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,659
- Torch it? Who are you?
- I don't know, Phil.

716
00:45:13,827 --> 00:45:16,203
Apparently I'm a guy who marries
complete strangers.

717
00:45:16,663 --> 00:45:21,375
This whole situation is completely fucked.

718
00:45:21,668 --> 00:45:25,171
- These mugs. This hat. This car.
- Hey!

719
00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:28,341
It's all evidence
of a night that never happened.

720
00:45:28,508 --> 00:45:30,676
That is why we're torching all of it.

721
00:45:30,844 --> 00:45:33,262
Whoa, I'm a schoolteacher,
I got a family, okay?

722
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,098
I'm all for secrecy,
but I'm not gonna torch a cop car.

723
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:38,059
- Fine. I'll do it.
- Can I help?

724
00:45:38,226 --> 00:45:40,853
- Yeah, thanks.
- And how exactly are you gonna do that?

725
00:45:41,021 --> 00:45:44,607
Easy. You just pour kerosene over a ferret,
light it on both ends, put it in.

726
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:46,442
They're attracted to the gas lines.

727
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:47,985
- What? A ferret?
- Yeah. Yeah.

728
00:45:48,153 --> 00:45:50,696
Or a tamed raccoon,
but it's a lot of trouble.

729
00:45:50,864 --> 00:45:53,032
If you wanna...
- Does it matter if it's tamed?

730
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,535
Yeah, because if it's untamed,
it won't take the kerosene as well.

731
00:45:57,913 --> 00:45:59,538
Is it Doug?
- I don't have it.

732
00:45:59,706 --> 00:46:01,207
It's Doug, it's Doug.

733
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:02,667
Uh, it's Melissa.

734
00:46:02,834 --> 00:46:05,336
- Don't answer.
- I have to. She's called twice already!

735
00:46:05,504 --> 00:46:06,671
- Can I ride shotgun?
Don't touch me.

736
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:08,839
Hey, sweetheart, how are you?

737
00:46:09,007 --> 00:46:12,218
There you are.
This is the third time I'm trying you.

738
00:46:12,386 --> 00:46:15,388
I know. The reception up here's crazy.

739
00:46:15,555 --> 00:46:18,307
I think it's all the sequoia trees,
block the signal.

740
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:21,394
Ugh, I hate that.
So how was it last night?

741
00:46:21,561 --> 00:46:24,522
Ah, it was really fun, actually.
It was quiet, but it was a good time.

742
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,232
That sounds nice.

743
00:46:27,442 --> 00:46:29,819
- I'm learning all kinds of vino factoids.
- Hi.

744
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,407
It'd be so cool if I could breast-feed,
you know?

745
00:46:34,574 --> 00:46:35,658
Well, listen...

746
00:46:36,952 --> 00:46:39,578
...we're about to go for a tractor ride.
What the fuck?

747
00:46:39,746 --> 00:46:43,207
I should get going. So pretty.
A tractor ride?

748
00:46:44,584 --> 00:46:46,460
- Go, out of the car!
- What was that?

749
00:46:46,628 --> 00:46:49,005
They started up the tractor.
I think it backfired.

750
00:46:49,172 --> 00:46:51,340
- Where the hell is he?
Hey, easy, easy.

751
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:53,926
I think we're looking for
the same guy, okay?

752
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:56,262
Hey! What the hell, man?

753
00:46:57,597 --> 00:47:00,099
What the fuck, Stu?
Is that a baby?

754
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:03,227
Why would there be a baby?
We're at a winery. That's a goat.

755
00:47:03,395 --> 00:47:06,355
- Where is he?
- I don't know! What are you talking about?

756
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:09,525
Sir, can you please start the tractor
so we can get out of here?

757
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:11,610
I'm trying to, but we're fucking blocked.

758
00:47:11,778 --> 00:47:14,363
Oh, my God!
What the hell is happening, Stu?

759
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,867
- Hey! There's a baby on board!
- Someone just said "baby. "

760
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:20,119
- Get out of the car!
- It's a baby goat.

761
00:47:20,287 --> 00:47:22,413
Why you making trouble
for my business, man?

762
00:47:22,581 --> 00:47:24,457
- Go away from here.
- Get out of the car!

763
00:47:24,624 --> 00:47:26,751
- Phil, he's got a gun!
- No shit he's got a gun!

764
00:47:26,918 --> 00:47:29,128
- I gotta call you back. Bye.
- Come on.

765
00:47:31,048 --> 00:47:32,631
Fuck! Shit.
He shot me!

766
00:47:32,799 --> 00:47:35,134
- He shot Eddie!
- Fuck this shit!

767
00:47:38,472 --> 00:47:40,389
Fuck! Fuck!

768
00:47:40,849 --> 00:47:43,434
Go, go, go!

769
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:46,812
Fuck.

770
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,981
Okay. Oh, that was some sick shit!

771
00:47:50,358 --> 00:47:51,400
Who were those guys?

772
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:53,652
We're gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

773
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,654
What the fuck is going on?!

774
00:47:56,782 --> 00:47:57,823
I have no idea.

775
00:48:04,664 --> 00:48:06,749
Why don't you just let that
go to voicemail?

776
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:08,459
Ha-ha-ha.

777
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:12,254
That's a fake laugh, by the way.

778
00:48:14,841 --> 00:48:19,386
It's got, uh, Ted Danson and Magnum
P. I. And that Jewish actor.

779
00:48:19,554 --> 00:48:21,180
Shut up, Alan.

780
00:48:21,348 --> 00:48:23,766
- What room was it again?
- It's 825.

781
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,352
I know, I did. I already checked with her.

782
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,898
I found him, I'll call you back.
Thank God, he's with his father.

783
00:48:31,066 --> 00:48:35,027
I was freaking out. I missed you, sweetie.

784
00:48:35,195 --> 00:48:37,530
And I miss you.

785
00:48:41,326 --> 00:48:42,743
No.

786
00:48:43,203 --> 00:48:47,039
- What the hell happened to you guys?
- Actually, we were hoping you could tell us.

787
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:50,126
What do you mean? I got up this morning,
I went to get coffee...

788
00:48:50,293 --> 00:48:52,294
...and I came back and you were gone.

789
00:48:54,047 --> 00:48:57,842
- Why are you being so quiet?
- I'm not being quiet.

790
00:48:58,218 --> 00:49:00,010
Ha, ha. You're so cute.

791
00:49:00,178 --> 00:49:03,305
Yeah, I gotta feed Tyler.
Come inside, you guys.

792
00:49:05,058 --> 00:49:07,643
Did you hear that? Baby's name is Tyler.

793
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:11,147
Yeah. I thought he looked
more like a Carlos too, bud.

794
00:49:14,568 --> 00:49:18,070
Okay, what's up?
You guys are acting weird.

795
00:49:18,238 --> 00:49:21,157
- Look, it's Jade, right?
- Very funny, Phil.

796
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:25,161
Right, Jade, uh, ahem,
you remember our friend, Doug.

797
00:49:25,328 --> 00:49:27,163
Are you kidding? He was the best man.

798
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:30,082
Exactly. Well, we can't find him,
and we're getting worried.

799
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:33,252
Oh, my God, that is so Doug.

800
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,087
Ha, ha. Oh.

801
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,008
Oh, sweetie, I'm...
I'm gonna go clean him off.

802
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:41,177
It's all right, Daddy didn't mean it.

803
00:49:41,344 --> 00:49:42,636
Oh, my God.

804
00:49:42,804 --> 00:49:44,930
What the fuck, man,
you gotta hold it together.

805
00:49:45,098 --> 00:49:46,765
- Holy shit.
- She is super hot.

806
00:49:46,933 --> 00:49:50,227
- You should be proud of yourself.
- She's wearing my grandmother's ring!

807
00:49:50,395 --> 00:49:52,354
- What?
- The ring I'm gonna give to Melissa.

808
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:54,523
You remember,
my grandmother's Holocaust ring?

809
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:56,775
- Fuck. Okay.
- She's wearing it.

810
00:49:56,943 --> 00:49:59,653
I didn't know they gave out rings
at the Holocaust.

811
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,823
- He's okay.
Oh, good.

812
00:50:02,991 --> 00:50:04,950
He was just hungry, he's fine.
- Oh, good.

813
00:50:05,118 --> 00:50:09,413
About last night, uh, ahem, do you
remember the last time you saw Doug?

814
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:13,167
- Uh, I haven't seen him since the wedding.
- The wedding. Okay. Great.

815
00:50:13,335 --> 00:50:16,629
And, uh, we can't re...
What time was that at?

816
00:50:16,796 --> 00:50:19,298
Well, it was, um...

817
00:50:21,301 --> 00:50:24,887
I guess it was around 1, because I had
to go back to work and finish my shift.

818
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:27,973
And then when I got out I headed over
to the hotel with Tyler.

819
00:50:28,141 --> 00:50:29,475
And was Doug there then?

820
00:50:29,643 --> 00:50:33,020
I didn't see Doug because you guys
were passed out. The room was a wreck.

821
00:50:33,188 --> 00:50:35,314
- So I just curled up next to Stu.
Uh-huh.

822
00:50:35,482 --> 00:50:37,191
- Rowr.
- Oh.

823
00:50:39,361 --> 00:50:42,238
I got a question.
Um, you said when your shift ended.

824
00:50:42,405 --> 00:50:46,659
Does that mean you're a nurse?
Or a blackjack dealer?

825
00:50:47,327 --> 00:50:49,995
- You know this. I'm a stripper.
- Mm-hm.

826
00:50:50,163 --> 00:50:53,916
Well, technically I'm an escort, but
stripping's a great way to meet the clients.

827
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:56,168
- Smart.
- Savvy.

828
00:50:56,336 --> 00:51:00,047
But that's all in the past,
now that I married a doctor.

829
00:51:00,215 --> 00:51:01,924
I'm just a dentist.

830
00:51:03,343 --> 00:51:04,760
- Las Vegas Police! Freeze!
- Okay.

831
00:51:06,137 --> 00:51:07,596
Shut that baby up! Shut that baby up!

832
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:10,474
Oh, God!
Okay, okay, okay.

833
00:51:16,189 --> 00:51:18,691
After we take the mug shots,
we bring them down here...

834
00:51:18,858 --> 00:51:22,444
...where they wait to be interviewed
by the arresting officers.

835
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:25,990
Trust me, kids, you do not wanna be sitting
on these benches.

836
00:51:26,157 --> 00:51:28,242
We call this place Loserville.

837
00:51:30,203 --> 00:51:33,205
Follow me. All right, let's do it. Come on.

838
00:51:38,503 --> 00:51:39,712
Hello.

839
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:43,007
- Hey, Tracy! It's Phil.
Hey, Phil.

840
00:51:43,174 --> 00:51:47,386
- Where are you guys?
- We are at the spa at the hotel.

841
00:51:47,554 --> 00:51:50,472
Cool. We're just getting some sun.
Is Doug around?

842
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,349
Of course. Why wouldn't he be?

843
00:51:52,517 --> 00:51:54,727
I'm just wondering
why you're calling me.

844
00:51:54,894 --> 00:51:56,395
Um...

845
00:51:56,563 --> 00:51:59,857
We made a deal,
no talking to girlfriends or wives.

846
00:52:00,025 --> 00:52:03,402
So we're all calling each other's.

847
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:05,029
Okay. What's up?

848
00:52:05,196 --> 00:52:09,241
Uh, you are not gonna believe this.
We got comped an extra night at the hotel.

849
00:52:09,409 --> 00:52:10,409
You did?

850
00:52:10,577 --> 00:52:13,370
Yeah. The suite is... It's ridiculous.
It's out of control.

851
00:52:13,538 --> 00:52:17,499
There's, like, room service and a butler.
I mean, just the works.

852
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,543
We're thinking of spending the night...

853
00:52:19,711 --> 00:52:21,920
...and we're gonna come back
in the morning.

854
00:52:22,088 --> 00:52:25,424
You wanna stay an extra night?
But the wedding's tomorrow.

855
00:52:25,592 --> 00:52:29,094
That's why we're gonna get up early,
and we'll be back in plenty of time.

856
00:52:29,262 --> 00:52:31,555
Okay. Are you sure that's a good idea?

857
00:52:31,723 --> 00:52:34,433
Wenneck, Price, Garner. Room 3.

858
00:52:34,601 --> 00:52:36,852
Okay, Trace, I gotta go.
We'll talk to you later.

859
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,354
Uh...

860
00:52:40,398 --> 00:52:42,649
- Come on, chop-chop.
- Okay, spin around.

861
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:45,194
- That's it.
- Goddamn it.

862
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,780
- Wait a second.
- I'll go over. I'll go over.

863
00:52:47,947 --> 00:52:49,865
Stop pulling.
Can you just...? Hold on.

864
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:52,785
We got it. Alan, just relax.
And then just... There we go.

865
00:52:52,952 --> 00:52:54,328
Good.

866
00:53:00,335 --> 00:53:02,002
Gentlemen.

867
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:05,089
We've got some good news,
and we've got some bad news.

868
00:53:05,256 --> 00:53:06,965
The good news is
we found your Mercedes.

869
00:53:08,468 --> 00:53:10,052
- That's great news.
- That's great. See?

870
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:14,640
Yeah, it's over at impound right now.
We picked it up at 5 a. m. This morning...

871
00:53:14,808 --> 00:53:16,934
...parked in the middle
of Las Vegas Boulevard.

872
00:53:17,644 --> 00:53:21,897
In the middle. That's weird.
- Yeah, that is weird.

873
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:23,148
There was also a note.

874
00:53:23,983 --> 00:53:29,113
It says, uh, "Couldn't find a meter,
but here's 4 bucks. "

875
00:53:30,031 --> 00:53:32,157
The bad news is...

876
00:53:32,325 --> 00:53:35,119
...we can't get you in front of a judge
until Monday morning.

877
00:53:35,995 --> 00:53:39,498
Oh, no, uh, officer, that's just impossible.

878
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:41,959
No, we need to be in L. A. Tomorrow
for a wedding.

879
00:53:42,127 --> 00:53:47,047
- You stole a police car.
- We didn't steal anything. Um, we found it.

880
00:53:47,215 --> 00:53:50,300
Yeah, if anything, we deserve a reward
or something, like a trophy.

881
00:53:51,136 --> 00:53:54,346
- I see assholes like you every day.
- Every fucking day.

882
00:53:54,514 --> 00:53:56,390
"Let's go to Vegas,
we'll all get drunk and laid!

883
00:53:56,558 --> 00:53:58,684
- Yeah. Whoo! Woo-hoo.
- Woo-hoo.

884
00:53:58,852 --> 00:54:01,854
Let's steal a cop car,
because it'd be really fucking funny. "

885
00:54:02,021 --> 00:54:04,273
Think you gonna get away with it?
Not up in here.

886
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,525
- Not up in here!
- Oh.

887
00:54:06,693 --> 00:54:08,569
Uh...

888
00:54:09,654 --> 00:54:11,113
Sir...

889
00:54:11,489 --> 00:54:12,865
...if I may, um...

890
00:54:13,032 --> 00:54:15,701
...I'm assuming that that squad car
belongs to one of you.

891
00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:17,578
- Yeah.
Yeah.

892
00:54:17,745 --> 00:54:20,122
Look, I'm not a cop.

893
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:23,375
I'm no hero. I'm a schoolteacher.

894
00:54:24,377 --> 00:54:27,671
But if one of my kids went missing
on a field trip...

895
00:54:28,631 --> 00:54:30,299
...that would look really bad on me.

896
00:54:31,593 --> 00:54:34,511
- What are you getting at?
- Yeah, Phil, what are you getting at?

897
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:38,056
No one wants to look bad.
We gotta get to a wedding...

898
00:54:38,224 --> 00:54:40,476
...and you guys don't need people
talking about...

899
00:54:40,643 --> 00:54:44,688
...how some obnoxious tourists borrowed
your squad car last night.

900
00:54:44,856 --> 00:54:47,774
But look, the point is,
I think we can work out a deal.

901
00:54:47,942 --> 00:54:49,860
Discreetly of course, ma'am.

902
00:54:50,862 --> 00:54:52,112
What do you say?

903
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:02,831
Let me ask you a question:

904
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:08,587
Do, uh, any of you gentlemen
have a heart condition or anything like that?

905
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:11,089
Uh, no.

906
00:55:11,257 --> 00:55:13,842
Okay, kids,
you're in for a real treat today.

907
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,929
These gentlemen have kindly volunteered
to demonstrate...

908
00:55:17,096 --> 00:55:19,848
...how a stun gun is used
to subdue a suspect.

909
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:21,099
Ooh!

910
00:55:21,267 --> 00:55:22,726
- That's right.
- Wait a sec. What?

911
00:55:22,894 --> 00:55:25,896
Now, there's two ways to use a stun gun.
Up close and personal.

912
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:31,860
- What the fuck?
- Or you can shoot it from a distance.

913
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:35,364
Do I have any volunteers? You wanna
come up here and do some shooting? Huh?

914
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:38,867
All right, how about you, young lady?
Come on up here. All right.

915
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:40,827
Let's go, handsome, come on.

916
00:55:40,995 --> 00:55:43,872
Not you, fat Jesus, slide it on back.
You, pretty boy.

917
00:55:44,457 --> 00:55:46,542
Fat Jesus.
All right, now, it's real simple.

918
00:55:46,709 --> 00:55:49,461
All you gotta do is point, aim and shoot.

919
00:55:49,629 --> 00:55:51,046
All right?

920
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:54,299
Okay, look.
You don't really wanna do this.

921
00:55:54,467 --> 00:55:56,760
You can do this. Just focus.

922
00:55:56,928 --> 00:55:59,429
Don't listen to this maniac.
Let's think this through.

923
00:55:59,597 --> 00:56:00,931
Finish him!

924
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:03,642
Oh, fuck.
Yeah!

925
00:56:05,186 --> 00:56:07,312
Right in the nuts! That was beautiful.

926
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,734
- Well done. Give her a hand, everybody.
- Good job. Good job.

927
00:56:13,987 --> 00:56:16,947
Good job. Well done. Good job.
That was great.

928
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:21,285
Good. Hey, we got one more charge left.
Anybody wanna do some shooting up here?

929
00:56:23,288 --> 00:56:25,205
How about you, big man?
Come on up here.

930
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:46,310
Okay, same instructions.
Just point, aim and shoot.

931
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,982
There you go. That's the stuff.

932
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:53,358
I like the intensity.

933
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:56,111
Eye of the tiger. Good.

934
00:56:56,279 --> 00:57:00,324
You're holding 50,000 volts, little man.
Don't be afraid to ride the lightning.

935
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:06,872
In the face! In the face!

936
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:11,501
Oh, he's still up. He's still up.

937
00:57:11,669 --> 00:57:13,211
- Aah!
- No.

938
00:57:13,379 --> 00:57:15,005
All right, everybody relax, take it easy.

939
00:57:15,548 --> 00:57:19,176
We've seen it before.
He just needs a little extra charge.

940
00:57:19,344 --> 00:57:20,761
There we go.

941
00:57:22,555 --> 00:57:25,265
Some of these big boys,
you gotta give them two shots.

942
00:57:25,433 --> 00:57:29,394
All right, kids, who wants to get their
fingerprints done, huh? Come on, let's go.

943
00:57:30,521 --> 00:57:33,607
Fuck those guys, you hear me?

944
00:57:33,775 --> 00:57:36,860
That was bullshit.
I'm telling everybody we stole a cop car.

945
00:57:37,028 --> 00:57:39,905
- They let us go, who cares?
- I care!

946
00:57:40,073 --> 00:57:44,951
You can't just do that. You can't just
tase people because you think it's funny.

947
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,245
That's police brutality.

948
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:53,251
I'm getting a soda.
Do you guys want anything?

949
00:57:53,419 --> 00:57:54,753
No.

950
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:01,927
My man doesn't shut up. Jesus Christ.

951
00:58:03,596 --> 00:58:06,181
Alan, you okay?

952
00:58:07,141 --> 00:58:09,184
I'm just worried.

953
00:58:09,977 --> 00:58:12,270
What if something happened to Doug?
Something bad.

954
00:58:12,438 --> 00:58:14,064
Come on, you can't think like that.

955
00:58:14,649 --> 00:58:16,483
I mean, what if he's dead?

956
00:58:16,651 --> 00:58:20,362
I can't afford to lose anybody
close to me again. It hurts too much.

957
00:58:20,988 --> 00:58:24,116
- I was so upset when my grandpa died.
- Oh, I'm s... How'd he die?

958
00:58:24,951 --> 00:58:27,744
- World War II.
- Died in battle?

959
00:58:27,912 --> 00:58:31,289
No, he was skiing in Vermont.
It was just during World War II.

960
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:33,500
Alan...

961
00:58:34,127 --> 00:58:36,294
...Doug is fine.
- Well, why hasn't he called?

962
00:58:36,462 --> 00:58:38,922
I don't know,
but we're gonna figure it out.

963
00:58:39,507 --> 00:58:43,552
I'll tell you another thing,
6-1 odds our car is beat to shit.

964
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,761
Stu, not now.

965
00:58:44,929 --> 00:58:47,764
No, how much do you wanna bet
it's fucked beyond recognition?

966
00:58:47,932 --> 00:58:51,977
That's enough. Alan's seriously worried,
okay? Let's not freak him out any more.

967
00:58:55,648 --> 00:58:57,023
Sorry, Alan.

968
00:58:57,191 --> 00:58:58,442
You know what?

969
00:58:58,609 --> 00:59:02,320
We'll search the car for clues
and everything's gonna be okay.

970
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:05,991
Oh, shit. I can't watch.
Just tell me what it looks like.

971
00:59:07,827 --> 00:59:10,328
Not looking. Not looking.

972
00:59:11,789 --> 00:59:14,833
- Wow. All right.
Oh, thank God.

973
00:59:15,001 --> 00:59:16,668
You see?

974
00:59:17,336 --> 00:59:19,171
It's gonna be all right.

975
00:59:25,678 --> 00:59:28,180
- Anything?
Hmm, I got a cigar.

976
00:59:28,347 --> 00:59:31,266
Oh, I found, uh...
These are some black shoes.

977
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:33,435
- They women's shoes?
- I don't know.

978
00:59:34,854 --> 00:59:38,106
- Whose are those?
- I don't know. It's a men's size 6.

979
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:40,859
- That's weird.
- What is this, a snakeskin?

980
00:59:41,027 --> 00:59:42,527
Oh, come on! Ew!

981
00:59:42,695 --> 00:59:45,363
- That's a used condom, Alan.
- Oh, God. Blech!

982
00:59:45,531 --> 00:59:47,657
- Get it out of the car.
Gross, it's wet.

983
00:59:47,825 --> 00:59:50,202
- I don't want the thing.
- Hey! Come on.

984
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:54,539
I got jizz on me. Jesus Christ, guys!

985
00:59:54,707 --> 00:59:57,375
Get it out.
Fuck!

986
00:59:57,752 --> 00:59:59,544
Oh, my God.

987
01:00:00,046 --> 01:00:03,840
All right, what the fuck, man?
We gotta get this shit together, guys!

988
01:00:06,552 --> 01:00:08,053
What was that?

989
01:00:08,554 --> 01:00:09,554
It's in the trunk.

990
01:00:10,431 --> 01:00:13,475
- Doug's in the trunk.
Oh, fuck! Holy shit!

991
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:15,560
Holy shit!

992
01:00:15,728 --> 01:00:17,854
- Open it! Open it! Open it!
Okay, okay, okay.

993
01:00:18,022 --> 01:00:19,731
Okay, okay, okay.

994
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,276
Oh God!

995
01:00:24,445 --> 01:00:26,571
Please! Please! Please stop!

996
01:00:34,413 --> 01:00:36,915
Whoa. I'm with you, I'm with you!

997
01:00:37,083 --> 01:00:40,043
- You gonna fuck on me?
- Nobody's gonna fuck on you!

998
01:00:40,211 --> 01:00:44,589
We're on your side. I hate Godzilla!
I hate him too. I hate him!

999
01:00:44,757 --> 01:00:47,717
He destroys cities! Please!

1000
01:00:47,885 --> 01:00:50,720
This isn't your fault.
I'll get you some pants.

1001
01:00:56,227 --> 01:00:58,937
What the fuck was that?

1002
01:01:00,273 --> 01:01:04,484
I have internal bleeding.
Somebody call 911.

1003
01:01:04,652 --> 01:01:07,404
That was some fucked up shit.

1004
01:01:07,572 --> 01:01:11,241
Who was that guy? He was so mean.

1005
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,662
Guys, there's something
I need to tell you.

1006
01:01:16,789 --> 01:01:20,709
Last night on the roof,
before we went out...

1007
01:01:21,919 --> 01:01:24,671
...I slipped something
in our Jägermeister.

1008
01:01:25,506 --> 01:01:28,300
- What?
- I'm sorry, I fudged up, guys.

1009
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:33,013
- You drugged us?
- No, I didn't drug you.

1010
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,473
I was told it was ecstasy.

1011
01:01:35,641 --> 01:01:37,934
Well, who told you it was ecstasy?

1012
01:01:38,102 --> 01:01:40,145
The guy I bought it from
at the liquor store.

1013
01:01:40,313 --> 01:01:41,980
Why would you give us ecstasy?

1014
01:01:42,148 --> 01:01:45,650
I wanted everybody to have a good time
and I knew you guys wouldn't take it.

1015
01:01:45,818 --> 01:01:48,820
It was just one hit each.
I used to do three hits a night.

1016
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:53,116
But it wasn't ecstasy, Alan,
it was roofies!

1017
01:01:53,284 --> 01:01:54,743
You think I knew that, Stu?

1018
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:58,163
The guy I bought it from
seemed like a real straight shooter.

1019
01:01:58,331 --> 01:02:01,291
You mean the drug dealer at the liquor store
wasn't a good guy?

1020
01:02:01,459 --> 01:02:02,500
Let's just calm down.

1021
01:02:02,668 --> 01:02:08,131
You fucking calm down! He drugged us.
I lost a tooth. I married a whore.

1022
01:02:08,299 --> 01:02:12,260
- How dare you! She's a nice lady.
- You are such a fucking moron.

1023
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:15,263
- Your language is offensive.
Fuck you!

1024
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:17,849
All right,
let's just take a deep breath, okay?

1025
01:02:18,643 --> 01:02:20,101
Seriously, this is a good thing.

1026
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:24,189
At least it's not some stranger who
drugged us for God knows what reason.

1027
01:02:24,357 --> 01:02:28,109
Yeah, you're right, Phil,
it's totally a good thing.

1028
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:30,612
We're so much better off now.

1029
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:34,449
Here's something
I would like to remind you two of:

1030
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:38,912
Our best friend Doug is probably
facedown in a ditch right now...

1031
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:42,040
...with a meth-head butt-fucking
his corpse.

1032
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:44,334
- That's highly unlikely.
- It's true.

1033
01:02:44,502 --> 01:02:48,213
Does not help.
All right, let's get our shit together, guys.

1034
01:02:48,381 --> 01:02:51,633
Let's go back to the hotel,
and I'm gonna make a couple calls.

1035
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:53,802
Maybe Doug's back there.
Maybe he's asleep.

1036
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:56,054
Come on. Let's go.

1037
01:02:56,222 --> 01:03:00,767
- Stu? Little help?
Shut up.

1038
01:03:03,604 --> 01:03:06,481
Ow.
- Oh, God. Oh, God, are you okay?

1039
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:09,192
Yeah, I'm fine.
- Alan, I'm sorry.

1040
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:21,621
Wait, guys. Guys.

1041
01:03:21,789 --> 01:03:23,665
What about the tiger?
What if he got out?

1042
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:28,503
Oh, fuck. I keep forgetting
about the goddamn tiger.

1043
01:03:28,921 --> 01:03:30,422
How the fuck did he get in there?

1044
01:03:30,881 --> 01:03:36,011
- I don't know, because I don't remember.
- Shh. Stu. Stu, keep it down.

1045
01:03:36,178 --> 01:03:39,597
Because one of the, uh, side effects of, uh,
roofies is memory loss.

1046
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,935
You are literally too stupid to insult.

1047
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,980
- Thank you.
- Hey.

1048
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:53,653
Hey, come on.

1049
01:03:56,782 --> 01:03:58,908
Did we leave the music on?

1050
01:03:59,201 --> 01:04:00,577
Hey. Shh.

1051
01:04:02,413 --> 01:04:04,998
Don't make any sudden movements.

1052
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:07,584
- Unh. Whoa!
- Aah!

1053
01:04:07,752 --> 01:04:09,544
- Who the hell are you?
- No, who are you?

1054
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:10,795
Quiet, quiet.

1055
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:15,967
Mike Tyson?

1056
01:04:16,135 --> 01:04:19,971
Shh. This is my favorite part
coming up right now.

1057
01:04:28,647 --> 01:04:29,731
Need a chorus line, guys.

1058
01:04:38,491 --> 01:04:39,783
One more time, guys.

1059
01:04:41,994 --> 01:04:43,244
Oh, Jesus!

1060
01:04:44,455 --> 01:04:45,747
Oh, fuck!

1061
01:04:46,499 --> 01:04:47,665
Why did you do that?

1062
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:52,170
Mr. Tyson would like to know
why is his tiger in your bathroom.

1063
01:04:52,338 --> 01:04:54,672
Hold on,
that was completely unnecessary.

1064
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,383
I'm a huge fan.
When you knocked out Holmes, that was...

1065
01:04:57,551 --> 01:04:59,344
Explain.

1066
01:04:59,845 --> 01:05:03,556
All right, look, we were drugged last night.
We have no memory of what happened.

1067
01:05:03,724 --> 01:05:04,766
It's true.

1068
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:08,394
We got in all kinds of trouble last night
and now we can't find our friend.

1069
01:05:08,562 --> 01:05:11,523
If you wanna kill us,
go ahead because I don't care anymore.

1070
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:13,691
- What are you talking about?
- I don't care.

1071
01:05:13,859 --> 01:05:16,277
Why the fuck
would you wanna steal his tiger?

1072
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:19,489
We tend to do dumb shit
when we're fucked up.

1073
01:05:19,657 --> 01:05:23,368
- I don't believe these guys, man.
- Wait, how did you guys find us?

1074
01:05:23,536 --> 01:05:27,330
One of you dropped your jacket.
Found it in the tigers' cage this morning.

1075
01:05:27,498 --> 01:05:28,832
That's Doug's.

1076
01:05:28,999 --> 01:05:32,168
Yeah, Doug.
His wallet and his room key is in there.

1077
01:05:32,336 --> 01:05:35,171
- No, that's our missing friend.
I don't give a fuck.

1078
01:05:35,339 --> 01:05:37,423
- Did you guys see him?
I was fast asleep.

1079
01:05:37,591 --> 01:05:40,552
Because if he was up, this
wouldn't have gone down so smoothly.

1080
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:42,679
Maybe one of the tigers
ate his ass like Omar.

1081
01:05:43,222 --> 01:05:44,222
Respect.

1082
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:45,515
Wha... What happened to Omar?

1083
01:05:45,683 --> 01:05:48,059
Oh, don't worry about Omar,
he's not with us no more.

1084
01:05:48,227 --> 01:05:50,478
Okay, I know this is asking a lot...

1085
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:53,606
...but do you think we could
go to your house and look around...

1086
01:05:53,774 --> 01:05:55,483
...see if there's any clues?

1087
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:59,863
Absolutely. How else you think
we're gonna get the tiger back anyway?

1088
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:02,991
- Come on, champ.
- I'm sorry?

1089
01:06:03,576 --> 01:06:07,579
We're not gonna put it in the Bentley.
You brought it here, you bring it back.

1090
01:06:07,746 --> 01:06:10,206
What you think, about 40 minutes?

1091
01:06:10,624 --> 01:06:13,126
Don't make me come back for him.

1092
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,883
- That was Mike Tyson.
- Yeah, no shit that was Mike Tyson.

1093
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:21,759
I'm just saying, he's still got it.

1094
01:06:23,095 --> 01:06:24,596
Alan.

1095
01:06:24,763 --> 01:06:25,805
Bud, are you okay?

1096
01:06:25,973 --> 01:06:27,390
Oh, my God.
- Shit!

1097
01:06:27,558 --> 01:06:28,850
Fuck, where'd he get him?

1098
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,059
Hey.

1099
01:06:35,316 --> 01:06:36,858
This does not seem fair.

1100
01:06:37,943 --> 01:06:40,945
It's Rock, Paper, Scissors.
There's nothing more fair.

1101
01:06:41,113 --> 01:06:44,407
- Alan should do it.
- Alan took a punch from Mike Tyson.

1102
01:06:44,575 --> 01:06:46,618
Come on. For Doug.

1103
01:06:46,785 --> 01:06:50,038
Why are you peppering the steak?
You don't know if tigers like pepper.

1104
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:53,333
Tigers love pepper. They hate cinnamon.

1105
01:06:55,794 --> 01:06:58,588
Phil, just do it. You should do it.

1106
01:06:58,756 --> 01:07:02,050
I would, but you lost.
It wouldn't be right.

1107
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:04,969
Okay, I jammed five roofies in there.

1108
01:07:05,137 --> 01:07:07,597
Just go in there and throw it in to him.

1109
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:10,141
Fine.

1110
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:12,894
Make sure he eats the whole thing.

1111
01:07:18,651 --> 01:07:20,151
Fuck.

1112
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:22,111
Oh, fuck.

1113
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:26,699
Hey, kitty.

1114
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:31,246
Hey, sweetie, it's okay.
I got a little snack for you.

1115
01:07:31,413 --> 01:07:33,998
Real important that you eat this, okay?

1116
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:37,168
Yeah, just have a little...

1117
01:07:40,506 --> 01:07:41,547
Shit!

1118
01:07:44,218 --> 01:07:45,385
What do we do now?

1119
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:47,929
We wait.

1120
01:07:57,773 --> 01:08:00,942
What do tigers dream of

1121
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:04,696
When they take a little tiger snooze?

1122
01:08:04,863 --> 01:08:08,074
Do they dream of mauling zebras

1123
01:08:08,242 --> 01:08:12,370
Or Halle Berry in her catwoman suit?

1124
01:08:12,538 --> 01:08:15,373
Don't you worry your pretty striped head

1125
01:08:15,541 --> 01:08:19,419
We're gonna get you back to Tyson
And your cozy tiger bed

1126
01:08:19,586 --> 01:08:22,755
And then we're gonna find
Our best friend Doug

1127
01:08:22,923 --> 01:08:26,551
And then we're gonna give him
A best-friend hug

1128
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:28,303
Doug

1129
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:30,263
Doug

1130
01:08:30,431 --> 01:08:34,934
Doug, Dougie, Dougie, Doug, Doug

1131
01:08:35,102 --> 01:08:40,231
But if he's been murdered
By crystal-meth tweakers

1132
01:08:42,067 --> 01:08:45,028
Well, then we're shit out of luck

1133
01:08:50,534 --> 01:08:52,910
By the way, we're all gonna die.

1134
01:08:57,249 --> 01:08:58,666
Wait.

1135
01:09:02,421 --> 01:09:03,588
Oh, God.
Watch it!

1136
01:09:03,756 --> 01:09:07,091
His nose. That's his nose.

1137
01:09:12,056 --> 01:09:14,766
Please don't stop. Please don't stop.

1138
01:09:16,101 --> 01:09:18,436
Please don't... Goddamn it.

1139
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:21,939
I'm gonna beat you! Ha-ha-ha.

1140
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:23,983
Oh... He won again.

1141
01:09:26,445 --> 01:09:30,740
- Hey, fellas. Rough night?
Mm-hm.

1142
01:09:30,908 --> 01:09:32,450
Sweetie, stay close to Mama.

1143
01:09:34,495 --> 01:09:36,954
- What's this?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1144
01:09:37,122 --> 01:09:40,124
Take it easy, little man.
You don't wanna be touching that.

1145
01:09:40,459 --> 01:09:43,044
No, partner, that's not your property.

1146
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:48,716
So, what do you guys got under there?

1147
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:51,761
Just a whole bunch of
"mind your own business. "

1148
01:09:52,137 --> 01:09:54,305
Easy, Phil.
- He's correct. My fault.

1149
01:09:54,765 --> 01:09:56,641
- You okay?
- Aren't we riding an elevator?

1150
01:09:56,809 --> 01:09:59,644
Why, is this Jeopardy?
What the fuck is this bullshit?

1151
01:09:59,812 --> 01:10:03,314
- Please, with the language.
- Yes.

1152
01:10:04,358 --> 01:10:06,317
- I fully agree.
- Oh.

1153
01:10:14,493 --> 01:10:17,161
Hey, guys, when's the next
Halley's comet?

1154
01:10:18,122 --> 01:10:21,124
- Who cares, man?
- Do you know, Stu?

1155
01:10:21,667 --> 01:10:24,836
I don't think it's for, like,
another 60 years or something.

1156
01:10:25,003 --> 01:10:27,964
- But it's not tonight, right?
- No, I don't think so.

1157
01:10:28,132 --> 01:10:30,049
But you don't know for sure?

1158
01:10:30,217 --> 01:10:31,843
No.

1159
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:34,595
I got this cousin who saw one.
He said it blew his mind.

1160
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:37,682
I wanna make sure I never, ever miss out
on a Halley's Comet.

1161
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:40,143
So if you guys
know if there's gonna be one...

1162
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:41,352
Oh, fuck!

1163
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:02,707
- Oh, my God!
Fuck it!

1164
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:05,710
Stu! Stu, it got me! Stu!

1165
01:11:05,878 --> 01:11:08,337
You got clawed! You're bleeding!

1166
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:12,467
- Oh.
I'm panicking.

1167
01:11:12,634 --> 01:11:14,260
- Aah!
Oh, my God.

1168
01:11:14,761 --> 01:11:16,971
Okay. Okay, okay. Wait, hold on.

1169
01:11:26,398 --> 01:11:28,900
- I can't do it.
Get your fucking hand back in there...

1170
01:11:29,067 --> 01:11:30,902
...and steer the car.
- I'm too nervous.

1171
01:11:31,069 --> 01:11:33,779
Alan. We need you, buddy.
This is your time to shine, okay?

1172
01:11:33,947 --> 01:11:35,907
Okay, yeah. Whew.

1173
01:11:36,408 --> 01:11:37,408
Daddy's gonna kill me.

1174
01:11:37,576 --> 01:11:39,243
- That's it.
That's good.

1175
01:11:39,411 --> 01:11:41,329
Keep it straight.

1176
01:11:50,714 --> 01:11:52,423
- You're late.
- Whatever, man.

1177
01:11:52,591 --> 01:11:54,383
We had to push it the last mile.

1178
01:11:54,551 --> 01:11:57,386
Come on in. Mike's got something
he wants to show you.

1179
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:05,686
That thing's out of control, man.
Seriously, you gotta put it down.

1180
01:12:08,023 --> 01:12:10,942
When we got back,
we took a look at the security cameras.

1181
01:12:11,109 --> 01:12:12,235
Great.

1182
01:12:14,655 --> 01:12:16,906
This is how you walk.
This is how you walk.

1183
01:12:17,074 --> 01:12:20,451
- Oh, it's Doug.
- Oh, thank God he's alive.

1184
01:12:20,619 --> 01:12:23,746
That's our buddy.
That's who we've been missing.

1185
01:12:23,914 --> 01:12:25,164
We're all best friends.

1186
01:12:25,332 --> 01:12:27,959
Why don't you just pay attention?
I don't have all night.

1187
01:12:28,126 --> 01:12:29,460
Yeah, of course. Of course.

1188
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:34,215
What are you doing?
Hey, guys. Check it out. Watch this.

1189
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:37,969
That's me, I'm on TV.
I've never been on TV before.

1190
01:12:38,136 --> 01:12:39,220
What are you doing, man?

1191
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:41,639
Really? Really, Alan?

1192
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:43,432
You got a fire hose, man?

1193
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:46,394
Yeah, I was, uh...

1194
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:51,190
You're gonna overflow the pool, man.

1195
01:12:52,192 --> 01:12:55,278
- Maybe... Should I wait outside?
- I think that's a good idea, Alan.

1196
01:12:55,487 --> 01:12:56,612
Yeah.

1197
01:12:58,323 --> 01:13:00,283
Don't touch anything out there, either.

1198
01:13:00,951 --> 01:13:04,579
You know what? He's not our good fr...
We don't know him that well.

1199
01:13:06,748 --> 01:13:09,500
Come on. Come on, come on.

1200
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:11,961
By the way,
where you get that cop car from?

1201
01:13:12,129 --> 01:13:14,964
We, uh, stole it from
these dumb-ass cops.

1202
01:13:15,132 --> 01:13:16,299
Nice.

1203
01:13:18,927 --> 01:13:21,512
High five that one.

1204
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,472
Yeah, that's nice.

1205
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,099
You know, I just have to say...

1206
01:13:25,267 --> 01:13:28,769
...I have never seen a more beautiful,
elegant, just regal creature.

1207
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:31,439
Check it out. Stu. Stu.
Fuck this tiger.

1208
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:35,026
Oh, my God. That's awful.
Oh, man.

1209
01:13:36,403 --> 01:13:39,196
Oh, shit.
- Who does shit like that, man?

1210
01:13:40,073 --> 01:13:44,035
Someone who has a lot of issues, obviously.
I'm a sick man.

1211
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:46,412
Oh, my God.

1212
01:13:47,664 --> 01:13:48,831
That's all we got.

1213
01:13:49,583 --> 01:13:52,627
This was hugely helpful.

1214
01:13:52,794 --> 01:13:55,713
Really. Because now we know
that our buddy Doug...

1215
01:13:55,881 --> 01:13:58,799
...was with us at 3:30, totally alive.

1216
01:13:59,259 --> 01:14:04,513
Thanks again, champ. And, uh, again,
we are so sorry we stole your tiger.

1217
01:14:04,681 --> 01:14:05,890
Don't worry about it, man.

1218
01:14:06,058 --> 01:14:08,601
Like you said, we all do dumb shit
when we're fucked up.

1219
01:14:11,063 --> 01:14:13,898
- I told you he'd get it.
- I did say that.

1220
01:14:17,736 --> 01:14:20,237
You know, everyone says
Mike Tyson is such a badass...

1221
01:14:20,405 --> 01:14:23,074
...but I think he's kind of a sweetheart.

1222
01:14:23,241 --> 01:14:25,159
I think he's mean.

1223
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:28,663
All right. I think it's officially time
we call Tracy.

1224
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:32,750
Hallelujah. Finally, Phil says something
that makes sense.

1225
01:14:32,918 --> 01:14:35,878
We don't have much of a choice.
And maybe she's heard from Doug.

1226
01:14:36,046 --> 01:14:38,047
That's what I been saying this whole time.

1227
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:42,551
We just need to be completely honest.
We need to tell her everything.

1228
01:14:44,137 --> 01:14:47,223
We don't have to tell her everything.
We can leave out the stuff...

1229
01:14:47,391 --> 01:14:49,600
...about me marrying a hooker.

1230
01:14:49,768 --> 01:14:52,353
Just stay focused on Doug.

1231
01:14:52,521 --> 01:14:55,773
- What am I gonna tell my dad?
- Alan, relax. It's just the inside.

1232
01:14:55,941 --> 01:14:58,776
Come on. I got a guy in L. A.
Who's great with interiors.

1233
01:15:09,287 --> 01:15:12,832
- Oh, Jesus!
Oh, my God.

1234
01:15:16,461 --> 01:15:18,754
- Are you guys okay?
What the fuck?

1235
01:15:27,431 --> 01:15:30,975
I know that guy.
That's the guy from the trunk.

1236
01:15:31,518 --> 01:15:34,395
Get out of the car. Please.

1237
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:37,857
W... W... Wait.
Those are the guys that shot Eddie.

1238
01:15:39,317 --> 01:15:40,443
- Listen...
Let's go!

1239
01:15:40,610 --> 01:15:42,319
- Okay.
- Oh, no.

1240
01:15:42,487 --> 01:15:43,988
Easy, easy.
Come on.

1241
01:15:44,156 --> 01:15:45,740
Okay. All right.

1242
01:15:45,907 --> 01:15:47,867
- All right, all right.
Let's go.

1243
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:51,787
Hey, relax. Ow. Ow. Ow!

1244
01:15:51,955 --> 01:15:53,998
- I have whiplash.
- Get this other fat boy.

1245
01:15:54,166 --> 01:15:55,624
Get the fat boy.

1246
01:15:55,792 --> 01:15:56,834
Hey, hey, hey.

1247
01:15:57,002 --> 01:15:59,920
All right, all right.
Hey, take it easy, take it easy!

1248
01:16:00,505 --> 01:16:04,884
I want my purse back, assholes.

1249
01:16:06,136 --> 01:16:09,138
- What? Your purse?
- That's not a purse, it's a satchel.

1250
01:16:09,306 --> 01:16:13,893
It's a purse. Okay?
And you steal from wrong guy.

1251
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:16,771
Wait a second, wait a second.
We stole from you?

1252
01:16:16,938 --> 01:16:18,022
Okay, you know what?

1253
01:16:18,190 --> 01:16:21,567
We don't remember anything
that happened last night...

1254
01:16:21,735 --> 01:16:23,903
...so help us out a little here.

1255
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:28,199
Well, apparently you guys met
at a craps table late last night.

1256
01:16:28,366 --> 01:16:30,701
You were on a heater,
and he played your hot streak.

1257
01:16:30,869 --> 01:16:34,371
- He ended up winning just under 80 grand.
- No shit? Eighty grand is nice.

1258
01:16:34,539 --> 01:16:35,623
Okay, that's good.

1259
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:39,043
He put the chips in his purse,
and then you guys took off with it.

1260
01:16:39,211 --> 01:16:40,920
That doesn't sound like us.

1261
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:46,801
Mine had $80,000 inside.
And this one? Nothing.

1262
01:16:46,968 --> 01:16:48,636
Hey, there are Skittles in there.

1263
01:16:49,054 --> 01:16:51,222
Ow! Oh, not again.

1264
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:55,267
Don't let the beard fool you.
He's a child.

1265
01:16:55,435 --> 01:16:57,394
It's funny because he's fat.

1266
01:16:57,562 --> 01:17:01,023
Now, look, this was obviously
a very simple misunderstanding.

1267
01:17:01,191 --> 01:17:03,984
Alan picked up the wrong purse,
it's no big deal.

1268
01:17:04,152 --> 01:17:07,988
Okay, if it's, "No big deal,"
why, when I come after you guys...

1269
01:17:08,156 --> 01:17:11,992
...he starts screaming like crazy and
throw me in trunk?

1270
01:17:12,202 --> 01:17:13,244
What, I did that?

1271
01:17:13,411 --> 01:17:16,997
Yeah, you said he was your lucky charm,
and you want to take him home with you.

1272
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,126
- Lucky charm.
- Oh, it's just funny.

1273
01:17:23,296 --> 01:17:24,421
Fuck you.

1274
01:17:25,715 --> 01:17:30,094
If you want to see your friend again,
you get me my 80 grand.

1275
01:17:30,262 --> 01:17:31,720
- What?
- Our friend?

1276
01:17:31,888 --> 01:17:34,014
- You have Doug?
You know about our friend?

1277
01:17:35,767 --> 01:17:37,726
- Doug!
- Doug!

1278
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:42,106
- Doug's in the car! Doug's in the car!
- Doug, it's okay!

1279
01:17:42,274 --> 01:17:44,066
You chill out, goatee!

1280
01:17:44,568 --> 01:17:48,404
- Okay, okay. All right, fine, fine.
- What do you want?

1281
01:17:48,572 --> 01:17:51,448
Not so good now.
Quid pro quo, douche bag.

1282
01:17:51,616 --> 01:17:52,741
What?

1283
01:17:52,909 --> 01:17:55,619
Look, we're very sorry.
But this is an easy fix.

1284
01:17:55,787 --> 01:17:57,872
- Alan, where's his purse?
- I don't know.

1285
01:17:58,039 --> 01:18:00,583
- It's in the hotel room, right?
- Yeah, we can get it.

1286
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:03,627
We can get you the...
We can even write you a check right now.

1287
01:18:03,795 --> 01:18:05,254
No chance. Cash only.

1288
01:18:05,422 --> 01:18:07,965
- There's a person in there.
Boring.

1289
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:11,343
Take nap. Come on.

1290
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:13,304
Wait. I'm sorry we're boring you!

1291
01:18:13,471 --> 01:18:16,974
Doug, it's okay.
- You kidnapped our friend! Kidnapper!

1292
01:18:17,142 --> 01:18:19,435
Wait.
Oh, no. You're not going anywhere.

1293
01:18:20,729 --> 01:18:22,146
Stop.

1294
01:18:22,647 --> 01:18:24,481
Stop. Run me over.

1295
01:18:25,191 --> 01:18:27,651
- Okay. Whoa. Whoa.
Stu, Stu, Stu.

1296
01:18:29,112 --> 01:18:33,574
Bring money to Big Rock
in Mojave Desert at dawn.

1297
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:38,037
- What?
- Toodle-oo, motherfucker.

1298
01:18:40,665 --> 01:18:44,877
Well, at least take the bag
off his head! Fuck!

1299
01:18:46,504 --> 01:18:47,963
Oh!

1300
01:18:56,348 --> 01:18:58,265
Come on, get out of here.

1301
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:07,816
Guys, I'm telling you, I looked for it this
morning before we left. It's not anywhere.

1302
01:19:07,984 --> 01:19:09,485
Fuck.

1303
01:19:12,572 --> 01:19:14,198
Stu, how much you got in the bank?

1304
01:19:14,366 --> 01:19:16,951
About 10 grand.
I was gonna use it for the wedding.

1305
01:19:17,118 --> 01:19:19,203
You're already married,
so we're good there.

1306
01:19:19,371 --> 01:19:21,538
Besides, enough with Melissa,
she's the worst.

1307
01:19:21,706 --> 01:19:24,375
Yeah, Doug told me she had sex
with a pilot or something.

1308
01:19:24,542 --> 01:19:28,337
It was a bartender on a cruise.
What is wrong with you people?

1309
01:19:28,505 --> 01:19:32,800
- Ew. Alan, did you just eat sofa pizza?
- Yes.

1310
01:19:33,843 --> 01:19:35,678
What are we gonna do?
We are so fucked.

1311
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:37,680
Hey, guys?

1312
01:19:37,847 --> 01:19:39,890
- Did you find it?
- Nope.

1313
01:19:41,059 --> 01:19:42,893
But check this out.

1314
01:20:30,108 --> 01:20:32,359
Change only, 10,000.

1315
01:20:36,114 --> 01:20:39,408
- Hey, uh, these seats taken?
- No, feel free.

1316
01:20:44,122 --> 01:20:46,790
All right, let's play some blackjack!

1317
01:21:09,064 --> 01:21:11,648
That's it. Shut up, bitches.

1318
01:21:15,862 --> 01:21:17,196
Hmm.

1319
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:22,409
- I'll stick.
- Oh, fuck you! Fuck you!

1320
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:30,334
Splitting fives.

1321
01:21:31,461 --> 01:21:32,669
- Too many.
- Yes!

1322
01:21:36,591 --> 01:21:39,843
I don't even know you,
but I'm gonna tell you that's dumb.

1323
01:21:40,637 --> 01:21:42,179
- Yes!
Oh!

1324
01:21:42,347 --> 01:21:45,682
Okay, come on.
He can't lose. He can't lose.

1325
01:21:46,935 --> 01:21:49,061
I think the pit boss is watching him.

1326
01:22:06,871 --> 01:22:08,122
- Oh, my God.
- Are you okay?

1327
01:22:08,289 --> 01:22:11,625
I'm such a klutz. I get so nervous
when I gamble. I'm so silly.

1328
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:15,254
- It happens.
- Whoa. Hold on a beat, okay?

1329
01:22:15,421 --> 01:22:18,549
- Let's just take it easy. This is my wife.
- It's hurting.

1330
01:22:18,716 --> 01:22:20,217
Make sure... Does it hurt? Does this hurt?

1331
01:22:20,385 --> 01:22:21,718
- Oh, ow.
- You all right?

1332
01:22:21,886 --> 01:22:24,138
I don't know.
- I don't know either. I don't...

1333
01:22:24,305 --> 01:22:25,639
I think you're fine. Let's go.

1334
01:22:25,807 --> 01:22:28,517
- Really? Okay.
Upsy-daisy, there.

1335
01:22:28,685 --> 01:22:31,645
I'm sorry,
she's had a little too much to drink.

1336
01:22:31,813 --> 01:22:34,940
Thanks, buddy. That's for you.

1337
01:22:43,283 --> 01:22:46,034
And 100, 200, 300, 400.

1338
01:22:46,202 --> 01:22:49,746
With all this, that's $82,400.

1339
01:22:49,914 --> 01:22:53,333
- Oh, goddamn it. I don't fucking believe it.
- Whoo!

1340
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:56,420
- Alan, you're the man.
- You are too, Phil.

1341
01:22:56,588 --> 01:22:59,256
We should come back next week,
take the whole city down.

1342
01:22:59,424 --> 01:23:00,632
Oh, I'm free next week.

1343
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:04,511
Or we could just focus
on getting Doug back, right now.

1344
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:07,931
Uh, you know what? Next week's no good,
the Jonas Brothers are in town.

1345
01:23:08,099 --> 01:23:10,684
But any week after that is totally fine.

1346
01:23:10,852 --> 01:23:14,271
I think it's safe to say that our luck
has officially turned around, guys.

1347
01:23:14,439 --> 01:23:19,776
- We are back, baby. We are fucking back.
- We're back. Classic.

1348
01:23:19,944 --> 01:23:21,778
We are back, we are back

1349
01:23:21,946 --> 01:23:23,280
That's right.

1350
01:23:23,448 --> 01:23:25,782
We are getting Doug back

1351
01:23:25,950 --> 01:23:29,119
And we're the three best friends
That anybody could have

1352
01:23:29,287 --> 01:23:32,122
We're the three best friends
That anyone could have

1353
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:35,792
We're the three best friends
That anyone can have

1354
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:38,962
And we'll never, ever, ever, ever, ever
Leave each other

1355
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:41,924
We're the best three friends
That anybody could have

1356
01:23:42,091 --> 01:23:44,927
I mean, the three best friends
That anybody could have

1357
01:23:45,094 --> 01:23:48,222
That's right, the three best friends
That anybody can have

1358
01:24:06,282 --> 01:24:08,325
Now what?
- Give him the signal.

1359
01:24:08,493 --> 01:24:12,120
- What signal?
- Flash your lights. Let him know it's on.

1360
01:24:12,288 --> 01:24:15,207
- What's on?
- The deal.

1361
01:24:15,375 --> 01:24:19,127
Of course it's on. We just drove 30 miles
into the desert. He knows it's on.

1362
01:24:19,295 --> 01:24:21,421
Phil, just do something.

1363
01:24:22,632 --> 01:24:23,924
Fine.

1364
01:24:27,011 --> 01:24:28,845
- Oh, shit.
See?

1365
01:24:29,013 --> 01:24:31,014
All right, let's go.

1366
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,446
Funny fat guy fall on face.

1367
01:24:46,614 --> 01:24:48,031
You okay?

1368
01:24:48,199 --> 01:24:50,993
All right, we got the money.
Eighty grand, cash.

1369
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:53,328
Throw it over. Then I give you Doug.

1370
01:24:53,496 --> 01:24:58,542
Um, I'm sorry. First of all, good morning.
And we didn't catch your name last night.

1371
01:24:58,710 --> 01:25:01,712
Mr. Chow. Leslie Chow.

1372
01:25:01,879 --> 01:25:04,214
Mr. Chow, it is a pleasure.
My name is Stu.

1373
01:25:04,382 --> 01:25:09,136
And we would very much appreciate
an opportunity to see Doug...

1374
01:25:09,304 --> 01:25:12,222
...before we give you the money,
just to verify that he's okay.

1375
01:25:12,390 --> 01:25:17,686
- Lf that's cool.
- Of course, Stu. That is cool.

1376
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:29,740
- Oh, thank God.
- Okay.

1377
01:25:29,907 --> 01:25:32,868
See, he fine. Now give me money...

1378
01:25:33,036 --> 01:25:36,997
...or I shoot him,
and I shoot all you motherfuckers.

1379
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:40,834
And then we take it.
Your choice, bitches.

1380
01:25:41,502 --> 01:25:43,003
- Give him the money, Stu.
- Okay.

1381
01:25:52,764 --> 01:25:55,599
It's all there.
- Let him go.

1382
01:25:58,561 --> 01:26:00,937
All right, take it easy. Take it easy.

1383
01:26:01,606 --> 01:26:02,773
Ta-da.

1384
01:26:04,108 --> 01:26:06,193
Is this some kind ofjoke?
Who the hell is this?

1385
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:07,402
That is not Doug.

1386
01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:10,530
What you talking about, Willis?
That him.

1387
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:13,116
No, I'm sorry, Mr. Chow.
That's not our friend.

1388
01:26:13,284 --> 01:26:16,328
- He... That's...
- The Doug we're looking for is a white.

1389
01:26:17,288 --> 01:26:21,083
Ah! I told you you had the wrong guy,
little boy.

1390
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:23,752
Damn, Alan,
what the fuck you got me into?

1391
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,630
- You know him?
- This is the guy that sold me the bad drugs.

1392
01:26:26,798 --> 01:26:29,341
- How you doing?
- I didn't sell you no fucking bad drugs.

1393
01:26:29,509 --> 01:26:34,638
- Wait. He sold you the Ruphylin?
- Ruphylin? I sold you that Ru...? Wha...?

1394
01:26:34,806 --> 01:26:38,892
- Who gives a shit? Where is Doug?
- I am Doug.

1395
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,395
- Your name's Doug?
- Yes, I'm Doug.

1396
01:26:41,562 --> 01:26:44,272
His name's Doug too. Ha. Classic mix-up.

1397
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,607
Come on.

1398
01:26:45,775 --> 01:26:49,986
- Hey, Chow. You gave us the wrong Doug.
- Not my problem.

1399
01:26:50,154 --> 01:26:53,824
No, fuck that shit. Now, you give us
our 80 grand back and take him with you!

1400
01:26:53,991 --> 01:26:58,662
- No. Come on. I'll be your Doug.
- Oh, yeah, okay. Oh, I take him back.

1401
01:26:58,830 --> 01:27:01,748
Right after you suck on
these little Chinese nuts.

1402
01:27:02,125 --> 01:27:05,168
- Ah. That's nasty.
- Mmm. How that sound?

1403
01:27:05,336 --> 01:27:06,878
Unh, pshh.

1404
01:27:07,046 --> 01:27:11,049
- So long, gay boys.
- Wait a second.

1405
01:27:11,217 --> 01:27:12,968
He's a nasty little motherfucker.

1406
01:27:13,136 --> 01:27:14,261
Did you ever get any ecstasy?

1407
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:16,513
No, I ain't got no fucking ecstasy.

1408
01:27:16,681 --> 01:27:19,891
- Goddamn it!
Gosh darn it!

1409
01:27:20,059 --> 01:27:23,186
- Shit!
Shoot!

1410
01:27:32,697 --> 01:27:34,865
Hello?
- Ahem, Tracy, it's Phil.

1411
01:27:35,032 --> 01:27:38,660
Phil, where the hell are you guys?
I'm freaking out.

1412
01:27:38,828 --> 01:27:40,537
Yeah, listen.

1413
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:44,541
We fucked up.

1414
01:27:44,709 --> 01:27:46,960
Thanks for the lift back to town.

1415
01:27:48,629 --> 01:27:50,380
- I got a question for you.
- What's up?

1416
01:27:50,548 --> 01:27:52,382
How did you wind up in Chow's car?

1417
01:27:53,134 --> 01:27:55,469
That crazy asshole
kidnapped me yesterday.

1418
01:27:55,636 --> 01:27:57,846
Okay, but why? I mean, why you?

1419
01:27:58,014 --> 01:28:01,516
He thought I was with you guys because
we were hanging over at the Bellagio.

1420
01:28:01,684 --> 01:28:03,393
- What?
- We were at the Bellagio?

1421
01:28:03,561 --> 01:28:05,520
We were shooting craps.
You don't remember?

1422
01:28:05,688 --> 01:28:08,023
No. No, we don't remember.

1423
01:28:08,191 --> 01:28:13,278
Because some dick drug dealer sold him
Ruphylin and told him it was ecstasy.

1424
01:28:13,446 --> 01:28:17,782
Ruphylin. There you go with that word.
Ruphylin. What the hell is a Ruphylin?

1425
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:22,204
Wow, you are
the world's shittiest drug dealer.

1426
01:28:22,371 --> 01:28:27,834
Ruphylin, for your information,
is the date-rape drug. You sold Alan roofies.

1427
01:28:28,002 --> 01:28:31,546
Oh, shit. I must have mixed up the bags.
My fault, Alan.

1428
01:28:31,714 --> 01:28:34,758
Damn, Marshall gonna be pissed off at me
on that one.

1429
01:28:35,259 --> 01:28:38,303
- Whatever.
- It's funny, because just the other day...

1430
01:28:38,471 --> 01:28:41,681
...me and my boy, we was wondering
why they even call them roofies.

1431
01:28:41,849 --> 01:28:44,851
- You know what I'm talking about?
- No. Don't know.

1432
01:28:45,019 --> 01:28:47,479
Why not floories, right?
Because when you take them...

1433
01:28:47,647 --> 01:28:50,815
...you're more likely
to end up on the floor than the roof.

1434
01:28:51,150 --> 01:28:54,444
What about groundies?
That's a good new name for them.

1435
01:28:54,612 --> 01:28:56,071
Or, how about rapies?

1436
01:28:56,697 --> 01:28:59,157
- Wait, what did you just say?
- Rapies.

1437
01:28:59,325 --> 01:29:03,036
- Not you. Doug, what did you say before?
- I said groundies.

1438
01:29:03,204 --> 01:29:04,246
No, before that.

1439
01:29:04,413 --> 01:29:09,876
You said, "You're more likely to wind up
on the floor than... "

1440
01:29:10,044 --> 01:29:12,796
- Phil.
- Listen, Trace, I'm really sorry. L...

1441
01:29:15,049 --> 01:29:17,926
Phil? Hello?
- Tracy, it's Stu.

1442
01:29:18,094 --> 01:29:20,303
Stu. Talk to me. What's going on?

1443
01:29:20,471 --> 01:29:22,430
Uh, nothing. Don't listen to Phil.

1444
01:29:22,598 --> 01:29:26,059
He's completely out of his mind.
He's probably still drunk from last night.

1445
01:29:26,227 --> 01:29:27,269
Where's Doug?

1446
01:29:27,436 --> 01:29:30,730
He is paying the bill.
We just had a delicious brunch.

1447
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:33,316
We're in a hurry to get back,
so we gotta get going.

1448
01:29:33,484 --> 01:29:35,652
- Okay, we'll see you soon. Bye.
- Stu.

1449
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:37,988
Stu. Fuck.

1450
01:29:38,155 --> 01:29:41,825
- What the fuck, man?
- I know where Doug is.

1451
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:50,250
I don't know, man. It just hit me.

1452
01:29:50,418 --> 01:29:53,336
You remember when we saw
Doug's mattress impaled on that statue?

1453
01:29:53,504 --> 01:29:55,839
- Yeah, we threw it out the window.
- No, impossible.

1454
01:29:56,007 --> 01:29:59,551
- You can't open windows in Vegas hotels.
- Well, then how did it get...?

1455
01:29:59,719 --> 01:30:01,928
- Oh, my God!
- Ha, ha, ha.

1456
01:30:02,096 --> 01:30:05,140
- Whoa, wait. What's going on?
- Doug was trying to signal someone.

1457
01:30:05,308 --> 01:30:06,766
- Holy shit.
Yes.

1458
01:30:06,934 --> 01:30:09,811
- Wait. How did you figure that out?
- Doug made me realize it.

1459
01:30:09,979 --> 01:30:11,855
- Doug?
- Uh, not our Doug. Black Doug.

1460
01:30:12,023 --> 01:30:15,191
- Hey, hey, easy with that shit. Come on.
- Sorry.

1461
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:17,193
Can someone tell me
where white Doug is?

1462
01:30:17,361 --> 01:30:18,945
- He's on the roof, Alan.
- Yes.

1463
01:30:19,113 --> 01:30:22,324
He's on the roof. We must have taken him
up there as a prank...

1464
01:30:22,491 --> 01:30:25,410
...so he'd wake up on the roof.
- Like that time in summer camp.

1465
01:30:25,578 --> 01:30:27,704
We moved his sleeping bag
out in the jetty at the lake?

1466
01:30:27,872 --> 01:30:29,623
Ha, ha, ha. Which was hilarious.

1467
01:30:29,790 --> 01:30:32,876
It's not so funny now, though,
because we forgot where we put him.

1468
01:30:33,044 --> 01:30:34,878
You guys are retarded, you know that?

1469
01:30:35,046 --> 01:30:39,466
- Holy shit. You think he's still up there?
- There's only one way to find out.

1470
01:30:44,055 --> 01:30:45,388
Doug!

1471
01:30:45,556 --> 01:30:47,390
Doug!

1472
01:30:47,558 --> 01:30:49,684
- Doug!
Doug, you up here, buddy?

1473
01:30:53,856 --> 01:30:55,899
Where you at, Doug?

1474
01:30:57,568 --> 01:30:59,194
Doug!

1475
01:31:02,907 --> 01:31:03,948
Hey, guys!

1476
01:31:04,909 --> 01:31:06,493
He's over here!

1477
01:31:08,204 --> 01:31:11,748
Hey, I found him! He's over here!
- Oh, shit.

1478
01:31:14,251 --> 01:31:15,543
He's okay.

1479
01:31:16,045 --> 01:31:17,712
You're okay. Ha, ha, ha!

1480
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:20,882
Oh, God. We gotta go, buddy. Come on.

1481
01:31:21,050 --> 01:31:24,052
Oh, we have been looking everywhere
for you.

1482
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:27,305
- He's alive.
- What the fuck is going on?

1483
01:31:27,473 --> 01:31:30,517
We can explain everything,
but right now we gotta go.

1484
01:31:30,685 --> 01:31:34,729
- Hey, bud. You okay?
- No. Not okay.

1485
01:31:34,897 --> 01:31:37,649
You look good, you got some color.
I'm jealous.

1486
01:31:37,817 --> 01:31:40,276
- I'm getting married today.
- Yes, you are.

1487
01:31:40,444 --> 01:31:42,987
That's why you need to focus
and do everything we say.

1488
01:31:43,155 --> 01:31:46,491
Because, frankly,
you're wasting a little bit of time right now.

1489
01:31:46,659 --> 01:31:47,951
You fucking asshole!

1490
01:31:51,205 --> 01:31:52,914
Oh, my skin burns. My skin burns.

1491
01:31:53,082 --> 01:31:54,791
Oh, ow! God.

1492
01:31:54,959 --> 01:31:58,211
- It's okay. It's not your fault, Doug.
- Don't touch me. Shut up.

1493
01:31:58,379 --> 01:31:59,796
All of you, shut up.

1494
01:32:00,756 --> 01:32:02,298
Just get me home.

1495
01:32:02,466 --> 01:32:03,591
Mm-hm.

1496
01:32:03,759 --> 01:32:05,552
Just get me home.

1497
01:32:06,262 --> 01:32:08,638
What about the one after that?

1498
01:32:08,848 --> 01:32:11,933
You cannot be serious.

1499
01:32:12,643 --> 01:32:14,185
Oh, goddamn it.

1500
01:32:14,353 --> 01:32:16,146
- What?
- Every flight to L. A. Is booked.

1501
01:32:16,313 --> 01:32:17,689
- What about Burbank?
- Sold out.

1502
01:32:17,857 --> 01:32:21,276
Oh, fuck! We can't drive there, the
wedding starts in three and a half hours.

1503
01:32:21,444 --> 01:32:23,653
- Alan, where's the car?
It's on its way.

1504
01:32:23,821 --> 01:32:25,155
You know what?

1505
01:32:25,322 --> 01:32:28,616
We can drive there.
We can make it. Okay?

1506
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:31,327
Hi.

1507
01:32:32,288 --> 01:32:36,124
- Just give me one second.
We will leave without you.

1508
01:32:38,669 --> 01:32:40,795
- Is he missing a tooth?
- Yeah.

1509
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:44,758
Hey.
- Hey.

1510
01:32:44,925 --> 01:32:47,677
Hey, thanks for helping out last night.
That was so awesome.

1511
01:32:47,845 --> 01:32:49,429
Sure.

1512
01:32:50,264 --> 01:32:52,724
Listen, Jade, I...

1513
01:32:52,892 --> 01:32:55,727
Look, you don't have to say it.
I totally understand.

1514
01:32:55,895 --> 01:32:59,022
- This whole thing was stupid.
- Huh.

1515
01:33:00,357 --> 01:33:01,983
It was stupid, wasn't it?

1516
01:33:09,116 --> 01:33:11,034
- This is yours.
- Oh, thank you.

1517
01:33:12,203 --> 01:33:16,206
I can't believe I gave my grandmother's
Holocaust ring to someone I just met.

1518
01:33:16,373 --> 01:33:19,042
- What was I thinking?
- You were really fucked up.

1519
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:20,919
Clearly.

1520
01:33:21,921 --> 01:33:24,589
- You did pull out your own tooth.
- L...?

1521
01:33:25,299 --> 01:33:26,382
I pulled out my tooth?

1522
01:33:27,676 --> 01:33:30,011
Why did I pull out my own tooth?

1523
01:33:30,179 --> 01:33:32,639
Alan bet you
that you weren't a good enough dentist...

1524
01:33:32,807 --> 01:33:34,224
...to pull out your own tooth.

1525
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:38,019
Okay. Heh.

1526
01:33:38,395 --> 01:33:41,564
- Of course he did.
- You won.

1527
01:33:41,732 --> 01:33:45,151
Yeah. Clearly. Yeah.

1528
01:33:45,319 --> 01:33:47,237
That's victory, right there.

1529
01:33:47,404 --> 01:33:49,113
It needs to go down.

1530
01:33:49,281 --> 01:33:51,032
- It's good. Get in.
- No. Safety first.

1531
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:54,702
- Alan, it's fine. It's down.
- No, I gotta get it down first.

1532
01:33:54,870 --> 01:33:58,998
Jesus Christ. Look out.
- Don't mess the car up.

1533
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:01,084
You're gonna mess the car up.

1534
01:34:01,252 --> 01:34:04,838
- Hey, what are you doing next weekend?
- I don't know. Working. Why?

1535
01:34:05,005 --> 01:34:08,049
I was thinking maybe I'd come back
and take you out to dinner.

1536
01:34:08,217 --> 01:34:10,760
Really? Like a date?

1537
01:34:10,928 --> 01:34:15,682
Yeah. Like a date.
Only, one that hopefully I'll remember.

1538
01:34:16,183 --> 01:34:17,934
Sounds good.

1539
01:34:21,397 --> 01:34:24,274
- Stu. Come on.
- Stu. Come on.

1540
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:29,737
I gotta go. Okay. Bye.

1541
01:34:32,449 --> 01:34:34,450
- Bye.
- Bye.

1542
01:34:36,579 --> 01:34:38,371
All right, here we go.

1543
01:34:38,873 --> 01:34:41,791
- All right, let's go.
- Yeah.

1544
01:34:41,959 --> 01:34:42,959
Careful.

1545
01:35:00,102 --> 01:35:02,770
At least the trip
wasn't a total disaster.

1546
01:35:02,938 --> 01:35:06,107
- What makes you say that?
- When I woke up on the roof...

1547
01:35:06,275 --> 01:35:10,153
...I happened to find $80,000
worth of Bellagio chips in my pocket.

1548
01:35:10,321 --> 01:35:12,071
- Oh!
Oh, my God!

1549
01:35:12,531 --> 01:35:16,034
Looks like we're going home
with some money, boys.

1550
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:35,345
Here he comes. That's him.

1551
01:35:37,556 --> 01:35:40,516
- Hey, Neeco!
Hey. What's up, Alan?

1552
01:35:40,684 --> 01:35:42,352
Whoo!

1553
01:35:43,812 --> 01:35:45,480
- Whoa, look out.
- Oh, shit.

1554
01:35:45,648 --> 01:35:47,649
Whoa! Whoa!

1555
01:35:51,028 --> 01:35:52,320
- Thanks, Neeco.
You got it, man.

1556
01:35:52,488 --> 01:35:53,905
Page me!
Adiós.

1557
01:35:54,323 --> 01:35:56,532
Who the hell was that guy?
That's my buddy.

1558
01:36:32,736 --> 01:36:37,573
Hey. Sorry, MapQuest took us
on a really crazy route.

1559
01:37:00,014 --> 01:37:01,764
- How's my hair?
- It looks good.

1560
01:37:01,932 --> 01:37:06,102
- Is it cool like Phil's?
- It's classic Phil.

1561
01:37:10,733 --> 01:37:12,775
She looks beautiful, man.

1562
01:37:19,199 --> 01:37:20,408
Sorry I'm late.

1563
01:37:21,952 --> 01:37:23,494
Vegas.

1564
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:32,170
Where were you?
And why are you so red?

1565
01:37:32,629 --> 01:37:36,507
Honey, it's a long story.

1566
01:37:37,426 --> 01:37:39,385
We are gathered here today...

1567
01:37:39,553 --> 01:37:43,139
...because of the strength of love
and of promises kept.

1568
01:37:43,307 --> 01:37:46,517
All I know is I am so sorry.

1569
01:37:46,852 --> 01:37:49,228
And I promise
for as long as we're married...

1570
01:37:49,396 --> 01:37:53,691
...to never, ever put you
through anything like this again.

1571
01:37:54,818 --> 01:37:56,694
Can you forgive me?

1572
01:38:42,533 --> 01:38:44,534
- Daddy.
- Hey, my man.

1573
01:38:44,701 --> 01:38:47,078
Excuse me,
but I'm expecting my husband any minute.

1574
01:38:47,246 --> 01:38:49,122
Oh, that's very funny. Come here.

1575
01:38:50,499 --> 01:38:51,582
How was your soccer game?

1576
01:39:08,559 --> 01:39:12,687
- Stu? You avoiding me?
- Hey. Melissa.

1577
01:39:12,855 --> 01:39:15,565
Oh, my God.
What happened to your tooth?

1578
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:19,902
Have you met Alan? Tracy's brother.
Brother of the...

1579
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:21,654
Okay. Ow.

1580
01:39:21,822 --> 01:39:24,740
That is disgusting.
Why haven't you returned my calls?

1581
01:39:25,325 --> 01:39:27,243
Well, there was a snafu
when we stopped...

1582
01:39:27,411 --> 01:39:29,287
I called that bed and breakfast in Napa.

1583
01:39:29,454 --> 01:39:32,623
They said they had no record
of you even checking in.

1584
01:39:33,333 --> 01:39:35,042
That's because we didn't go to Napa.

1585
01:39:35,210 --> 01:39:39,213
- Stu. What the fuck is going on?
- We went to Las Vegas.

1586
01:39:39,381 --> 01:39:42,508
Oh, really? Las Vegas?
Why would you go to Las Vegas?

1587
01:39:42,676 --> 01:39:45,219
My friend was getting married.
That's what guys do.

1588
01:39:45,387 --> 01:39:47,138
- Okay, that's not what you do.
- Really?

1589
01:39:47,306 --> 01:39:51,767
Well, then why did I do it, huh?
Because I did it. Riddle me that.

1590
01:39:51,935 --> 01:39:53,436
Why'd I do it?

1591
01:39:53,604 --> 01:39:55,813
All you want me to do
is what you want me to do.

1592
01:39:55,981 --> 01:39:57,857
I'm sick of doing what you want.

1593
01:39:58,025 --> 01:40:01,569
In a healthy relationship,
a guy should be able to do what he wants.

1594
01:40:01,737 --> 01:40:04,780
- That is not how this works!
Oh, good.

1595
01:40:04,948 --> 01:40:07,950
Because whatever this is
ain't working for me!

1596
01:40:08,118 --> 01:40:09,160
Oh, really?
Yeah.

1597
01:40:09,328 --> 01:40:10,453
Since when?

1598
01:40:10,621 --> 01:40:15,166
Since you fucked that waiter
on your cruise last June. Boom!

1599
01:40:18,086 --> 01:40:21,797
- You told me it was a bartender.
- Oh, you're right. I stand corrected.

1600
01:40:21,965 --> 01:40:25,134
It was a bartender.
You fucked a bartender.

1601
01:40:25,302 --> 01:40:26,719
You're an idiot.

1602
01:40:26,887 --> 01:40:27,929
You're... You...

1603
01:40:29,973 --> 01:40:31,474
You're such a bad person.

1604
01:40:31,642 --> 01:40:33,643
Like, all the way through to your core.

1605
01:40:35,979 --> 01:40:38,856
Alan, shall we dance?

1606
01:40:39,983 --> 01:40:41,025
Let's do this.

1607
01:40:49,826 --> 01:40:52,495
- It was a real pleasure meeting you.
- Fuck off.

1608
01:40:53,121 --> 01:40:56,249
- I'm getting my bartender's license.
- Suck my dick.

1609
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,376
No, thank you.

1610
01:41:08,512 --> 01:41:09,512
You guys are awe...

1611
01:41:10,889 --> 01:41:12,848
Sid?
- There he is.

1612
01:41:13,183 --> 01:41:17,019
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

1613
01:41:17,187 --> 01:41:19,522
- Congratulations, buddy.
- Congratulations to you.

1614
01:41:19,690 --> 01:41:22,566
- You had us worried there for a second.
- Sorry.

1615
01:41:22,734 --> 01:41:23,859
How was Vegas?

1616
01:41:24,152 --> 01:41:27,029
It was... Ahem. It was crazy.

1617
01:41:27,197 --> 01:41:28,781
Attaboy.

1618
01:41:32,536 --> 01:41:35,079
- Enjoy the car?
- Mm-hm.

1619
01:41:36,123 --> 01:41:40,042
- Remember to put Armor All on the tires?
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

1620
01:41:43,297 --> 01:41:45,006
Let me ask you a question.

1621
01:41:49,303 --> 01:41:52,513
How can a cake cost $1400?

1622
01:41:54,725 --> 01:41:57,768
- Highway robbery.
- It's criminal.

1623
01:41:58,228 --> 01:42:01,188
Sid, ahem, about the car...

1624
01:42:07,863 --> 01:42:12,033
Tracy told you. I told her not to tell you.
I wanted to tell you.

1625
01:42:14,494 --> 01:42:17,913
- Tell me what?
- Careful, Doug. These women...

1626
01:42:18,749 --> 01:42:19,915
...can't be trusted.

1627
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:24,378
- Tell me what, Sid?
- The Mercedes.

1628
01:42:24,546 --> 01:42:26,922
It is a wedding gift from Linda and I.

1629
01:42:28,633 --> 01:42:30,926
- Are you serious?
- What do you think?

1630
01:42:41,104 --> 01:42:42,605
That is awesome.

1631
01:42:44,316 --> 01:42:46,067
Thank you. Oh.

1632
01:42:48,278 --> 01:42:50,988
Thanks, Daddy. Thanks, Sid.

1633
01:42:51,156 --> 01:42:53,532
Close the door.
- You're awesome.

1634
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:55,576
You are awesome.

1635
01:42:57,287 --> 01:42:58,704
Yeah.

1636
01:43:06,797 --> 01:43:08,089
Dougie...

1637
01:43:08,256 --> 01:43:10,716
...I gotta tell you, man,
this was a gorgeous wedding.

1638
01:43:10,884 --> 01:43:13,803
- I give it six months.
- You're a dick.

1639
01:43:14,805 --> 01:43:19,183
I don't know what to say.
Thanks for the bachelor party, I guess?

1640
01:43:19,976 --> 01:43:24,313
Yeah. I just wish
we could actually remember some of it.

1641
01:43:24,481 --> 01:43:27,858
- Hey, guys? Look what I found.
- Whoa, that's my camera.

1642
01:43:28,026 --> 01:43:31,153
- It was in the back seat of the car.
- Oh, Go... Are there photos on it?

1643
01:43:31,321 --> 01:43:33,656
Yeah. Some of it's even worse
than we thought.

1644
01:43:33,824 --> 01:43:35,866
- No fucking way. Give me that.
- Wa... Wa... Wait.

1645
01:43:36,034 --> 01:43:38,536
Wait, wait, wait.

1646
01:43:40,997 --> 01:43:45,543
We look at these pictures together, okay?
One time.

1647
01:43:46,002 --> 01:43:50,172
- And then we delete the evidence.
- I say we delete it right now.

1648
01:43:50,340 --> 01:43:54,009
Are you nuts? I wanna find out
how I wound up in the hospital.

1649
01:43:54,177 --> 01:43:58,180
- Yeah, it's in there.
- Guys, one time.

1650
01:43:58,348 --> 01:43:59,390
- Deal?
- Deal.

1651
01:43:59,558 --> 01:44:01,225
- Deal.
- Okay.

1652
01:44:05,689 --> 01:44:07,231
Oh, dear Lord!

1653
01:44:07,399 --> 01:44:08,607
That's classic!
