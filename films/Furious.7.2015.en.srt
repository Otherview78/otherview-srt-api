1
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,306
They say if you
want to glimpse the future,

2
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,809
just look behind you.

3
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,646
I used to think
that was bollocks.

4
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,857
But now I realize

5
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,820
you can't outrun the past.

6
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,035
When we were kids,

7
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:21,373
you'd start fights
with the toughest bastards in the yard.

8
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,961
But I was the one who had
to step in and finish them.

9
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,006
Rest now, little brother,

10
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,842
while I settle
your one last score.

11
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,350
You take care of my brother.

12
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,352
Anything happens to him,

13
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,354
I'll come by looking for you.

14
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,879
Here. Hold this.

15
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,505
Grenade!

16
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,197
Come on, Dom. So where are you taking me?

17
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,784
They say an open road
helps you think

18
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:25,455
about where you've been,
where you're going.

19
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,960
So you don't remember
any of this yet?

20
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,337
That's not fair.

21
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,965
You know I don't.

22
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,804
So what is it exactly that
you're trying to show me?

23
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,265
That.

24
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,854
Race Wars.

25
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,649
We used to come here?

26
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:53,817
"Come here"?

27
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,569
We invented it.

28
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,821
Keep it under 9,000 RPMs.

29
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,532
Kid's gonna fry his pistons
after the first 200.

30
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,828
You know that's not my style.
I gotta ride or die, right?

31
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,707
How about you just ride
on this one?

32
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,435
Are you ready?

33
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,397
I know you're ready!

34
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:29,788
Go!

35
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,876
Hey, nice job.

36
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,338
Hey!

37
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,174
That's the girl
I heard so much about.

38
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,302
Where you been at,
ghost girl?

39
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,392
Ghost girl.

40
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:43,820
Letty, what the hell?

41
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:44,946
Huh?

42
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,288
Damn, dawg! Girl's still got that swing, homie.

43
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,292
You never could
take a punch.

44
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,337
Right, right.

45
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,963
Hey, man.
I'm glad you're back, man.

46
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,298
It's good to see you!

47
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,342
Good to see you, Hector.

48
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,363
All right.
We made it, Jack.

49
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,782
Yeah, we made it!
Yeah, we made it.

50
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,951
Now I just gotta find
that door button.

51
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,119
Buddy, where's the door
button at? Do you know?

52
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,371
Hi.
Hey.

53
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,625
Yeah, of course. I'm new to this.

54
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,085
Yeah, you don't seem
like the minivan type.

55
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,252
No, not exactly.

56
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,420
Hey, buddy, you gonna
give me a high five?

57
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,005
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait, high five!

58
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,423
All right. Yeah, buddy.

59
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,466
Appreciate it. Thank you.

60
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,301
Don't worry. You'll get
used to this in no time.

61
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,555
Yeah, that's what
I'm afraid of.

62
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,381
First time I saw this,

63
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,427
I thought
it was kind of funny.

64
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,474
I guess now
the joke's on me.

65
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,185
What are you doing?

66
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,940
What I should've done
a long time ago.

67
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,817
Stop it!

68
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,112
Look at it.

69
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,405
It's the truth.

70
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,243
That's the date
that I lost my memory.

71
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,329
That's the date
that Letty died

72
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,166
and I was born.
No.

73
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,084
You never died.

74
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,462
Do you know how hard it is
for me when you look at me

75
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,631
and you see me through
15 years of memories?

76
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,469
Every beautiful moment
we've ever had.

77
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,763
I see it in your eyes.

78
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,474
I can't give that to you.

79
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,851
I got nothing.

80
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,019
You got me.

81
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,397
And you've got
only a piece of me.

82
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,318
I have to find myself.

83
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,819
For me.

84
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,503
Goodbye, Dom.

85
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:09,859
You're disappointed,
aren't you?

86
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,195
What are you talking about?

87
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,655
The last arrest.

88
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,699
He was too easy.
Target didn't even run.

89
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,076
Ah, it's okay.

90
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,328
Gives me a chance
to hit the iron.

91
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:23,414
Also lets me work on
my stamping skills.

92
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,168
You're a terrible liar.

93
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,212
See you tomorrow, boss.

94
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,172
I'll see you then.
Don't stay too late.

95
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,174
I'll stay as long
as I want, woman.

96
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,093
I knew you would say that.

97
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:48,690
Elena?

98
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,907
What's this?

99
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,784
It's the letter
of recommendation you asked for.

100
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,454
Just know I meant
every word in there.

101
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:06,958
Thanks, Hobbs.

102
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,918
Thanks for everything.

103
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,549
Come on, way too sentimental
right now.

104
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,717
Get home. Good night.

105
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,427
Okay. Good night.

106
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,379
Just one sec.

107
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,886
You sure as hell
ain't the IT guy.

108
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:00,970
So you better start talking

109
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,473
before I break that finger
six different ways

110
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,975
and stick it right where the sun doesn't shine.

111
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,188
Agent Hobbs, right?

112
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,273
That's right.

113
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,734
I'm also the last
man on Earth

114
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,611
whose computer you want
to be hacking into.

115
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,948
You just earned yourself
a dance with the devil, boy.

116
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,116
You're under arrest.

117
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:26,329
Like I said, I'm here for the team
that crippled my brother.

118
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,332
There ain't no goddamn team.

119
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,002
It was just one man,
and he's standing right in front of you.

120
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,096
The lady was right.

121
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,224
You are a terrible liar.

122
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,828
Goddamn IT guys.

123
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,135
Hobbs!

124
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,054
On me!

125
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,440
Elena!

126
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:39,796
Hobbs?

127
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,382
Hobbs!

128
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,454
All right, buddy.
We gotta go. We're gonna be late.

129
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,164
Come on.

130
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,419
Okay, what do you think?

131
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,379
Parking brake slide
right up to the school?

132
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,422
Where's Mommy?

133
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,007
I don't know. She's up there. She's coming.

134
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,342
Oh.

135
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:30,847
Here we go.

136
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,390
Watch your head.

137
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,102
Dom, you have
a package out here!

138
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,687
It's from Tokyo.

139
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,188
Tokyo?

140
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,442
What? Is Han trying to convert
me over to a turbocharger?

141
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,818
All right, you ready?

142
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:44,944
There we go.

143
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,322
- Yeah!
- Hey, buddy. Cars don't fly.

144
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,824
Hey, cars don't fly.

145
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,701
This one did, huh?

146
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:55,204
Brian in a minivan.
Things have changed.

147
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,623
He's struggling, Dom.

148
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,208
He doesn't
want me to see it,

149
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:02,753
but the white picket fence is
like an anchor on him. I can tell.

150
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,175
I tried to talk to him the other night.
You know what he said?

151
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,052
He doesn't miss the girls,
he doesn't miss the cars.

152
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,722
He misses the bullets.

153
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,892
Let him settle in.
Give him time.

154
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,060
How does nine months sound?

155
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,149
I'm having another baby.

156
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,698
And you didn't tell him,
did you?

157
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,952
You gotta tell him.

158
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,166
I don't want him to be
disappointed with his life.

159
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,086
With me.

160
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,048
He will never be
disappointed with you.

161
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,759
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to him.

162
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,888
Thank you.

163
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:04,774
Yeah?

164
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,983
Dominic Toretto.

165
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,654
You don't know me.

166
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,030
You're about to.

167
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,409
Get down!

168
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,346
Jack!

169
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,602
Jack!

170
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,261
Shattered his collarbone,

171
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,597
fractured his leg
in two places.

172
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,390
He only regained
consciousness this morning.

173
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,852
The first thing he said was,
"Get me Dom."

174
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,315
He's in there.

175
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,410
Are you okay?

176
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,872
I'm fine.

177
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,416
He's waiting. Let's go.

178
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,720
Got something for you.

179
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,641
Your files.

180
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,059
Thank you.

181
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,270
You risk life and limb

182
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:07,855
to save the free world
and what do they give you?

183
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:11,442
Jell-O and a bad
'70s TV show.

184
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,572
You know, it's got its perks.

185
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,574
Sponge baths ain't that bad.
- Dad!

186
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,909
I'm sorry, baby.

187
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,827
"Dad"?

188
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,830
Honey, I want to introduce you
to somebody. He's a, uh...

189
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:27,667
He's an old friend.

190
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,001
Go on and say hello.

191
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,711
Dominic Toretto, right?

192
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:34,048
My dad said he
kicked your ass once.

193
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,258
Young lady,
watch your mouth.

194
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,222
Your dad's on
heavy pain meds.

195
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,433
I can understand if his history is a little hazy.

196
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,477
I doubt it. All right, honey, that's enough.

197
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,562
I want you to go get
something to eat with Elena

198
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,356
while me and Toretto
have a talk. You hear me?

199
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,191
Come on, lady.
Let's get some cookies.

200
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,943
Watch that mouth.

201
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,989
Who did this?

202
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,118
You remember Owen Shaw?

203
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,705
The one we tore half
of London down trying to get.

204
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,499
Well, this is his
big bad brother.

205
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,459
Take a look at this.

206
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,384
Deckard Shaw.

207
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,594
British Special
Forces assassin.

208
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,471
The kind of unique asset

209
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,807
that no government would
ever admit to employing.

210
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,100
Black Ops boys.

211
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,519
Worse.
They created a monster.

212
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,856
They felt Shaw
was a necessary evil

213
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,858
until eventually

214
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,360
they decided
he was unnecessary.

215
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,738
The powers that be

216
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,906
felt that he knew
just a little bit too much.

217
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,783
The asset became a liability.

218
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,828
So they sent in 20 elite
operatives to retire him.

219
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,455
And they missed.

220
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,581
That was six years ago,

221
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,249
and Shaw's been
a ghost ever since.

222
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,417
Until now.

223
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,463
How do I find him?

224
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:58,382
The official answer
is, you don't.

225
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,179
He killed Han.

226
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,097
Almost killed my family.

227
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:07,349
He also tried to put me
in a body bag, too.

228
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,144
Which is why when I get out,
I'm gonna put a hurt on him so bad

229
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,105
he's gonna wish his mama
had kept her legs closed.

230
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,649
But until then,
my official answer to you

231
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,443
is stand down.

232
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,779
Now, you know
I can't do that.

233
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,030
I do know you, Dom.

234
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,324
Which is why now I give you

235
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,284
the brother-to-brother answer.

236
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,454
You do whatever
it is you gotta do.

237
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,581
When you find that sumbitch,

238
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,458
just do me one favor.

239
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,210
What's that?

240
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,713
Don't miss.

241
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,848
Thank you so much
for letting us stay, Mando.

242
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,141
I hope it's not a problem.

243
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,353
Listen, Dom needed
a safe delivered to Rio in two days.

244
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,437
That was a problem.

245
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,564
Hosting his family
in the Dominican Republic,

246
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:56,816
that is vacation.

247
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,359
Anyone messes with you here,

248
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,319
they mess with
the entire country.

249
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,695
You'll be safe.

250
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,415
Yeah, yeah, they're here.
I picked them up myself at the airport.

251
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,167
Hold on. Your brother.

252
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,252
Dom.

253
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,920
Yeah, Mia, it's me.

254
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,004
How's it going there?

255
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,422
We're at Mando's.

256
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,924
This place is like a fortress.

257
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,219
You should see Brian.
He's in full FBI mode.

258
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,514
He built a surveillance hub
in Mando's garage and everything.

259
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,308
What about you?
Did you find out who's after us?

260
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:34,186
Looks like the sins of London
have followed us home.

261
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,896
How did Buster take the news?

262
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,356
I can't tell him.

263
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,441
If he knew about the baby,
he'd stay here with us.

264
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,611
And with all that's going on,
you're gonna need him by your side.

265
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,698
Just watch out for
him. Keep him safe.

266
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,782
And come home together.

267
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:50,744
Tell Brian I'll see him
in LA in two days.

268
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,121
Where are you going?

269
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,706
Tokyo.

270
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,250
I'm bringing Han home.

271
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,503
Authorities are still
trying to determine

272
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:02,214
the motive behind this
daring attack here at the office

273
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,759
of the US Diplomatic Security
Service in downtown Los Angeles

274
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,596
less than 36 hours ago.

275
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:09,763
Facts are still coming in,

276
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:12,016
but what is known
is the suspect entered

277
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,727
the building's fourth floor...

278
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,145
Hey.

279
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,647
You okay?
Yeah.

280
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:22,151
This guy's just relentless.

281
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,863
That's why Dom needs you.

282
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,949
You two need to find this
guy and you need to stop him

283
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,785
before he does any more
damage to our family.

284
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,205
You know, I just...

285
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,709
I've screwed up
so many things.

286
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,463
I couldn't live with myself
if I screw this up, too.

287
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,006
You won't.

288
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,176
I believe in you.

289
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,512
I believe in us.
That's all that matters.

290
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,557
I love you, Brian.

291
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,693
I love you, baby.

292
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:09,949
Just promise me,
after this, we're done.

293
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,952
No more jobs, no more enemies.

294
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,745
Come back to us.

295
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,664
I won't let you down, Mia.

296
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:19,500
I know.

297
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,475
Hey, yo, Sean!

298
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,893
Hey, check this out, man.

299
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,104
This dude over here
want to race the new DK.

300
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,523
Not tonight, Twinkie.

301
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,317
Said he knew Han.

302
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:55,911
Han said you was fast,
but not that damn fast.

303
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,248
Who said American
muscle can't drift?

304
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:04,253
Han mentioned he left his
enemies in his rear view.

305
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,715
He never talked
about it much.

306
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,759
Always playing it
close to the vest.

307
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,809
We found a couple
things by the crash.

308
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,644
Wasn't much left.

309
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,820
Gisele.

310
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,409
Oh, yeah.

311
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,453
There's one more thing.

312
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,291
I found this.

313
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,463
Must have meant
something to him.

314
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,923
When you find the guy
that killed Han,

315
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,801
what are you going to do?

316
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:57,681
Words ain't even
been invented yet.

317
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:22,623
They say to live in the hearts
of those we leave behind

318
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,209
is not to die.

319
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,878
But he put you in this grave.

320
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,508
So now I'll do
the same to him.

321
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,681
I can't do no
more funerals.

322
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,266
First Han.

323
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,772
Now Hobbs is laid up,
of all people.

324
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,904
We're being hunted.

325
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,830
You know he's out there
somewhere watching, right?

326
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,706
I hope so.

327
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,667
Means he's close.

328
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,212
Just promise me, Brian,

329
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,297
no more funerals.

330
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:13,924
Just one more.

331
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:18,971
His.

332
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,413
You never should have
messed with a man's family.

333
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,164
I told your brother
the same thing.

334
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,503
Reinforced your chassis.

335
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,589
It's like going into a ring
with weighted gloves.

336
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:00,632
Your mistake.

337
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,217
I'm not here to play games.

338
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:06,930
See, you and me, we're from different worlds.

339
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:10,767
Trust me, I've seen a lot meaner
streets than the ones you're used to.

340
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,227
Stick around.

341
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,439
It's gonna get a lot meaner.

342
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,277
You thought this was
gonna be a street fight?

343
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,881
On the ground.

344
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,424
Now!

345
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,219
Drop him
or I will drop you!

346
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,599
Whoa, whoa. Easy, guys.
We're on the same team here.

347
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,101
Mr. Toretto,

348
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,229
I'm here on the recommendation
of a mutual friend of ours.

349
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,065
Mr. Hobbs.
Who the hell are you?

350
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,858
Me? I'm just a guy.

351
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,735
I'm Mr. Nobody.

352
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,613
It's a big entrance
for a nobody.

353
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:08,450
And the guy that put
our mutual friend in the hospital?

354
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:09,618
You just let him get away.

355
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:13,455
I think I might have just
saved your ass there, Dom.

356
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,791
Listen, you think you could
let go of my guy there?

357
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,210
He's beginning to
turn a little blue.

358
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:22,297
I appreciate that.

359
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,591
Ah, here they come.

360
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,675
Listen, Dom.

361
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:30,722
There's a war going
on between shadows and ghosts like me.

362
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:35,102
You and your team unwittingly
walked into the middle of it in London,

363
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:37,562
and it appears it's
now followed you home.

364
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,858
It's up to you.

365
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:43,652
I'm gonna have a beer.

366
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:45,737
You're welcome to join me.

367
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,657
By the way, I can
get you Deckard Shaw.

368
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,838
Belgian ale.

369
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,260
Oh, man, those
monks got it right.

370
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,262
I mean, I don't know
about the whole celibacy thing,

371
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,347
but when it
comes to beer...

372
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,266
Would you like one?

373
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,685
I'm more of a
Corona man myself.

374
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:17,853
Ah.

375
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:24,401
Your file's not
only detailed,

376
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:27,821
it's, uh,
extremely entertaining.

377
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:36,788
Look, Shaw's power
is that he's a shadow.

378
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:39,958
He's really good at getting in and
out of places without being seen

379
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,127
and leaving nothing
but a body count in his wake.

380
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,714
I mean, he's a legitimate
English badass.

381
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:47,716
But to be honest with you,
Dom, I don't give two shits

382
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,468
about Deckard Shaw.

383
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,927
It's you I want.

384
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:55,056
Because you and I can help each
other get what we both need.

385
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,684
I'm listening.

386
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,312
Just recently
a private military company

387
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,273
led by a wanted terrorist
named Mose Jakande

388
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,859
kidnapped a hacker known
only by the name "Ramsey."

389
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,027
Now, Lady Liberty's
got her panties

390
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,820
in a bunch over this,
but rightfully so,

391
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,781
because this Ramsey has
created something interesting.

392
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,742
Bring it up.
- Yes, sir.

393
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,535
Say hello

394
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,078
to God's Eye.

395
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,998
Now, this little bastard hacks
into anything that's on the digital network.

396
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:23,752
That means every cell phone,
satellite, ATM machine and computer.

397
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,045
Simultaneously.

398
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,922
If it's got
a microphone or a lens,

399
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,715
God's Eye can
use it to find you.

400
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,176
So you invited me here
to show me a tracking device.

401
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,345
On steroids. Lots of them.

402
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,013
Let me put it
to you this way.

403
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,682
It took us nearly a decade
to find Osama bin Laden.

404
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,101
With this, we'd have located
him anywhere on the planet

405
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:41,811
in a couple of hours.

406
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,356
Now, that's a serious
piece of machinery

407
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,399
that could be catastrophic
in the wrong hands.

408
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,860
But for some very nauseating
political reasons,

409
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,237
any rescue plans involving

410
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,198
any US government
forces or entity

411
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,242
has been strictly ruled out.

412
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,370
And that's why I need you.

413
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:01,122
But why do I need you?

414
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,458
I mean,
I could go back outside,

415
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,502
enjoy the rest
of the Coronas,

416
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,629
let Shaw come to me.

417
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:10,423
You could do that.
How's that working out for you so far?

418
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,550
You got one friend
in the ground,

419
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:12,884
another one in the hospital.

420
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,262
And then, of course,
there's that little issue of the bomb

421
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,472
that destroyed your home.

422
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,474
Shaw lives in a
world that doesn't

423
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,476
play by your rules.

424
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,270
Like it or not,

425
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,772
you live in that
world now, too.

426
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,775
You wanna know
how to kill a shadow?

427
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,152
You just shine
a little light on it.

428
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,904
If you get the
God's Eye for me,

429
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,614
I've already got
authorization

430
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,908
for you to use it
until you get Shaw.

431
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,952
You go from the hunted
to the hunter.

432
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,371
And there's no place on Earth
Shaw can hide from you.

433
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,290
More importantly,

434
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:49,170
you and your family don't
go to any more funerals.

435
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,799
You get Ramsey,
you get the God's Eye,

436
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,217
you get Shaw.

437
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,096
Well, that's the wind-up
and the pitch.

438
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,474
Now that I've given you
this incredibly sensitive

439
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,977
and highly
classified information,

440
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,562
what do you think, Toretto?

441
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,023
I think you already know
what I'm gonna do.

442
00:35:08,398 --> 00:35:09,649
Good.

443
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,527
But it'll be my way.

444
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:14,404
And my crew.

445
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,531
I assumed you
might say that.

446
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:20,327
Which is why I've taken
the liberty of gathering your team.

447
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,924
This is crazy.

448
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,844
What the hell is
going on in here?

449
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,765
Our intelligence
suggests that Ramsey

450
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,642
will be transported
by an armed motorcade

451
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,477
through the Caucasus
mountain range.

452
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,687
If they clear this range
and reach their destination,

453
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,481
Ramsey is as good as gone.

454
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,690
So let me
get this straight.

455
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,318
There's only one road
that leads in or out,

456
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,445
sheer drops on every side,

457
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,156
a motorcade from hell
protected by a small army

458
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,741
from one mile in
either direction?

459
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,410
Yeah, that's about it.

460
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,579
You done?
No, I'm not done.

461
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,790
So you all wanted me
to break into

462
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,458
a police station. Fine.

463
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,585
Then you asked me
to stop a tank.

464
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,504
I wasn't happy about it,
but I did it.

465
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:14,756
Then you came up with
this brilliant idea

466
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:18,259
to shoot down one
of the largest airplanes ever.

467
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,929
I shot that shit
out of the sky. Mmm.

468
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,430
It's nothing.

469
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,808
But this right here,
my friend,

470
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,142
happens to be

471
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:29,604
the stupidest idea I've ever heard of in my life.

472
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,815
I forgot that you were the only
one to bring the plane down.

473
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,983
No, no. The only thing I've
ever seen him take down was

474
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,235
"No Knees" Denise.

475
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,112
Remember, at prom?

476
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,239
Really, Brian? You're gonna do that right here?

477
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,866
See, y'all trying to get me
off my point.

478
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,078
All I'm saying is,
I'm tired of everybody around me

479
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,247
making all the decisions.

480
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,790
This time, I lead.

481
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,127
Seriously. If I don't start
making decisions, I'm out.

482
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,962
All right, Roman.

483
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:55,672
What do you got?

484
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:01,553
I mean, I wasn't trying to get
into the whole leadership thing, like, now.

485
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,012
You know what I'm saying?

486
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:05,181
I was just, kind of,
talking about, like, at some point.

487
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,391
Like, you know, when we...

488
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,351
Whatever. I mean, I think...

489
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:12,397
Let's hit it from here.

490
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,733
I don't think that that's... No,
no, no, don't think.

491
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:16,693
That's my job.

492
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,113
Okay.

493
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,075
It is impossible
to hit it there.

494
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:27,412
That is literally the most
secure spot on the mountain.

495
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,914
Why? Because you cannot
physically access it.

496
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:32,250
See, that's what
makes it so sweet.

497
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,919
Because it's the place that they
least expect us to hit them from.

498
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,629
As much as
I hate to admit it,

499
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:37,714
he's onto something there.

500
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,215
What do you think, Dom?

501
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,010
Here?
- Yeah.

502
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,054
I think we got a plan.

503
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,932
Completely wrong thinking.

504
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,017
And I like it.

505
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,853
You see? I'm good at this.

506
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,522
"Good"? Okay.

507
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,858
How are you
planning on getting on that road?

508
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,861
Well, Tej?

509
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,491
I think I may actually
have a plan for that.

510
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:09,704
What? I delegated.
That's what good leaders do.

511
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,039
Leader!

512
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:13,166
You know, when I was
reading your files,

513
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,460
I was impressed with what you've
accomplished with your team.

514
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:19,214
But meeting them now,
I've gotta say, Dom,

515
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,633
you've truly got a gift.

516
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:28,181
Consider my workshop
your new playhouse.

517
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:32,393
I think you'll find our
cars extremely appealing.

518
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,231
And your team
is now complete.

519
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,868
I went to the house.

520
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,746
I was looking
for you everywhere.

521
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,166
You scared the
shit out of me.

522
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,589
You will never be alone.
Wherever you go...

523
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,424
Tell no one.

524
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,885
Where did you find that?

525
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,098
Found in Han's car.

526
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,141
It was left as a message.

527
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:15,103
A message I plan
on returning.

528
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:17,689
Can you ride?

529
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,399
Yeah, of course I can.

530
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,776
Han was my family, too.

531
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,156
Brian!

532
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,409
We're gonna need
long-travel suspension,

533
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,536
limited-slip differentials
on all of them.

534
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,787
How you doing?

535
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,539
Tej!

536
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,917
I want the demon
love child between that

537
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,420
and that.

538
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,964
That's a lot of armor.

539
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,591
It's just gonna
add more weight.

540
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,092
Slow you down.

541
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,430
This time, it ain't
just about being fast.

542
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,188
Yeah, I'm good.

543
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,443
From the streets.
You know what I'm saying?

544
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,194
It's nothing.

545
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,536
Hey, Roman, you're freaking out, ain't you?

546
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,038
No.
Yeah, you are.

547
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,456
I said no.

548
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:20,043
Listen, man, it takes a grown
man to embrace his feelings.

549
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,670
If you need to cry,
just go ahead and cry.

550
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,257
As your friend, you know I'm
concerned about your well-being,

551
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,675
which is why I took
the precaution

552
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,595
of putting some adult diapers
in your glove compartment.

553
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:31,846
Yo, can you just
chill out, man?

554
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,432
I have seen
some crazy shit, Dom,

555
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,184
but this really
could make some waves.

556
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:39,979
So let's just try to keep it
as low-key as possible, huh?

557
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,230
Don't I always?

558
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:44,901
I'll tell you what, you knock it
down a couple of notches this time

559
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,946
and I'll swap out my Belgian
for a keg of Corona.

560
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,531
You'd be doing
yourself a favor, there.

561
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,493
Can somebody just walk me through
what we're supposed to be doing?

562
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,995
Come on, Rom, this is your plan.
You gotta embrace it.

563
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,497
No, this was not my plan.

564
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,669
Oh, yeah, here we go.
Game time.

565
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,226
Roman,
you need some fresh air?

566
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,061
Because you're about to
get a whole lot of it.

567
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,733
Okay, here we go!

568
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,920
Just when you didn't think
it could get any better, huh?

569
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:53,428
Oh, shit!

570
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,066
Whoo!

571
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:08,985
Now we're moving.

572
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:19,454
Everybody good?
Everybody make it out?

573
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,335
You just didn't tell them
that this is not for you!

574
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:27,712
This is not your mission!

575
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,131
Hey, Rom? Hey, what's up, man?
Talk to me, come on!

576
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,884
I can't do it.
- The hell you can't!

577
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,427
Come on, man!
You throw that thing

578
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,179
in reverse and get
your ass out here now!

579
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,556
Look, I can't do it, okay?
Listen to what I'm saying.

580
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,724
Now isn't the time!

581
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,142
I'ma stay up here
with the pilot.

582
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:43,061
We gonna circle
around and make sure

583
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,437
we holding it down
from up here!

584
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:45,855
You're running
out of time!

585
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:48,149
The chute is guided by GPS!

586
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,401
You don't have
to do anything!

587
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,111
Tej!
I'm already on it.

588
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,072
Hey, man, listen.

589
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,615
I'm sorry to
let y'all down, okay?

590
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,116
I'ma go ahead
and stay up here.

591
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,201
No, brother.

592
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,786
I'm sorry to let you down. What?

593
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,830
What do you mean you're...

594
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:08,211
Tej! What are you doing?

595
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,843
Oh, shit!

596
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,346
Tej!

597
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,681
I hate you, Tej!

598
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:24,894
Get ready!

599
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:26,354
Ground's coming fast!

600
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,197
Come on, baby. Come on.

601
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:20,992
Oh, yeah!

602
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,913
Touchdown, baby!

603
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:31,836
Car check. Call it in.

604
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,004
Check.
Check.

605
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,130
I'm good. Let's do this.

606
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,428
Hello? Please, man.
Get me out of here, somebody!

607
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,013
No! The trees!

608
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:43,723
Oh, shit.

609
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,349
Sit tight, Roman.
We'll come back for you.

610
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:46,934
This is not the plan!

611
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,207
All right, you got one
chance to hit them here, Dom.

612
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,334
You miss, they'll make
it to their black site

613
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,711
and they'll squeeze whatever
information they need out of Ramsey.

614
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,714
The device and your chance of ever
getting Shaw will be gone for good.

615
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:17,924
That ain't gonna happen.

616
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,009
I'll see you at the pickup.

617
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:26,265
Ramsey will be in the bus.

618
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:27,516
Then let's do this.

619
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,945
Captain, we have company.
Four cars, inbound.

620
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,335
Oh, shit!

621
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:07,765
Tej, shield!
I'm on the way.

622
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:13,854
All right, formation.

623
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:21,862
Bulletproof, baby.

624
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:23,948
Can't touch this

625
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:28,703
Punch it!

626
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,854
Strike! Ha-ha!

627
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,490
Guns free.

628
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:12,288
No!

629
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,210
Get out of the way!

630
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:33,309
Those aren't guns,
those are goddamn cannons!

631
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,685
Armor-piercing rounds!

632
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:00,044
Hook them up.

633
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,302
Brian, Tej, blow it!

634
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,604
Lock it up.

635
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:24,693
Huh?

636
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:30,908
Brian, you're up.

637
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:50,803
Little closer, Tej!

638
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,131
Ramsey?

639
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,842
Stay away from me!
Stay back! Don't you touch me!

640
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,343
My name's Brian.
I'm gonna get you out of here

641
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:32,970
but I'm gonna need you
to settle down, all right?

642
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,346
I'm gonna cut those
things off of you.

643
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:50,946
Sir?

644
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,575
Sir, we have
an unidentified vehicle approaching.

645
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,703
Come on! Closer!

646
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,246
You're gonna have to jump.
- No! No! No!

647
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,331
We don't have time!
Come on!

648
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,125
We gotta get out of here.
Come on.

649
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,752
Look at me! Look at me! I'm not jumping!

650
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,546
You don't jump,
we're gonna die. Okay?

651
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,381
You're jumping. Come on!

652
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:10,716
One.

653
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,134
Two!

654
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:21,977
Well, well, well.

655
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:29,318
Take my hand!

656
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:47,711
Welcome to the
party, Mr. Shaw.

657
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:38,637
Letty, stay with Brian.

658
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:03,912
Oh, shit!

659
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,294
What are you doing?
This is crazy!

660
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,587
Keeping you alive.

661
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,926
There's a cliff. Cliff!

662
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,636
Cliff! There's a cliff!

663
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:38,465
Shit!

664
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,395
Too slow.

665
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,357
Yeah!

666
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:21,902
I'm back, bitches!

667
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,078
You good?

668
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,372
Thank you.

669
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,766
Roman, get back to the others.
What about you?

670
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:17,225
Don't worry about me.

671
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,911
I have to say,
I am impressed.

672
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:22,207
I would very much
like to know the name of the man

673
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,710
who is causing me
so much trouble.

674
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,171
There's no way out of there.

675
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:29,381
What is he doing?

676
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,341
He's frozen like a damn deer in headlights.

677
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,218
Toretto ain't no deer.

678
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,053
Come on, Dominic.

679
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:38,306
Give us the girl,
and I'll let you live.

680
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,517
What are you going to do?

681
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,439
You might wanna put
on your helmet for this one.

682
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:49,026
Helm...

683
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,490
Target the driver.

684
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,416
Damn it!
What is he thinking?

685
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,335
You're insane!

686
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,512
You're pointing
the wrong way.

687
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:18,764
Am I now?

688
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:27,439
Fire on my mark.

689
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,025
Interesting.
Three!

690
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:33,403
Two!
Hold on.

691
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:34,654
One!

692
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:36,907
Fire!

693
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,131
Looks like our
demon love child worked.

694
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:35,966
That's one way
down a mountain.

695
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,218
Where's Ramsey?

696
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,567
Hello Kitty is awake.

697
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:59,072
She don't look like
a hacker to me.

698
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:01,575
Oh, yeah? And what do
hackers look like?

699
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,618
They don't supposed
to look like that.

700
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,329
I'm just saying, like,

701
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:07,998
you know how they
normally wear them little,

702
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,916
weird glasses
that's all crooked,

703
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:12,460
and pimples all over their face
from drinking soda?

704
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:15,672
I mean, trust me,
with a body like that,

705
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,549
you ain't gonna park it
behind a computer.

706
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,051
How are you feeling?

707
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:21,595
Did you hit your head?

708
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:26,016
Feeling nauseous?
Ears ringing? No?

709
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:28,018
Where's my shoe?

710
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,603
Oh, it flew off
when you crashed.

711
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:33,398
If you start experiencing any
of those things, let me know, okay?

712
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,901
I don't know whether
to thank you for rescuing me

713
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:38,153
or kick your ass for throwing me off a cliff.

714
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:40,989
Thank us or kick
our ass, huh?

715
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,535
How about you tell us
where that device is?

716
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,497
I mailed it to a friend.

717
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:50,665
In Abu Dhabi.

718
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,043
That was pretty easy.

719
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:56,004
That other team would have
tortured you for that information.

720
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:59,132
I didn't trust them.
I trust you.

721
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:03,595
Now, why would you trust us?
You barely know us.

722
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,305
I know enough.

723
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:10,101
Ex-cop. Military,
something like that.

724
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:13,480
The way you took out
them guys shows training.

725
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:17,525
Tech guy, offended
by the hacker remark, naturally.

726
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:19,694
Alpha.

727
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,113
Mrs. Alpha.

728
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,824
Joker.

729
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:26,326
Wrong.

730
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:29,871
Double alpha.

731
01:02:29,955 --> 01:02:32,123
Man candy. You know
what I'm saying?

732
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:33,375
Man, sit your
candy ass down.

733
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:38,004
The disrespect is
real around here.

734
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,507
Life is binary.
Zeroes and ones.

735
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,759
Only two things keep a group like this together.

736
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,552
Fear or loyalty.

737
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,639
And I don't see a drop of fear among you guys.

738
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,225
Very impressive.
Just one thing.

739
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:51,434
They're not married.

740
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:53,728
She's so off, it's crazy.
You just gonna roll with it?

741
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:56,523
You're telling me there can't
be a double alpha in one group?

742
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:57,691
You work for US government?

743
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,736
We got similar interests.

744
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,492
Tej, call it in.

745
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,911
We're going
to the Middle East!

746
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,212
Hey.

747
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,476
Hey, Dom. It was pretty
wild on that mountain, huh?

748
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,520
No, it was too close.

749
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:37,314
But we got the job done.

750
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:41,693
You know what
the crazy thing is, is...

751
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:44,487
You miss the bullets.

752
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,074
Yeah, that's messed up, huh?

753
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:50,994
Brian, I've seen you jump
from trains, dive from planes.

754
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,331
Hell, I saw your courage
the day I met you.

755
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:55,874
Right.

756
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:59,127
Want to know the bravest
thing I ever saw you do?

757
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,880
Be a good man to Mia.

758
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,760
Being a great father
to my nephew, Jack.

759
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,512
Everyone's looking
for the thrill,

760
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:13,391
but what's real is family.

761
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,727
Your family.

762
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:17,979
Hold on to that, Brian.

763
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,296
It's hotter than I
thought it would be.

764
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:28,341
Yeah, well, we are in the desert,
so it would be hot.

765
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:29,884
Oh, no, I ain't talking
about the weather.

766
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,225
My, my, my.
Hmm.

767
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,110
Now, that is a woman

768
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,612
that's worth falling
out a plane for.

769
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:51,322
Get out of there, man,
I got dibs on that.

770
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:52,407
You've seen me
looking at that.

771
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:54,159
Did you just say "dibs"?

772
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:55,368
What are you, in
the fourth grade?

773
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:56,995
Man, can you
just get out of there?

774
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,204
I mean,
it's a free market.

775
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:00,707
What are you talking about?
Get out of there.

776
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,292
Rock, paper,
scissors for her.

777
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,919
Are you guys for
real right now?

778
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:06,713
Look at you.

779
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:08,548
You both look
whupped already.

780
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:09,757
You got stalker eyes.

781
01:06:10,175 --> 01:06:13,219
I tried to call dibs
on Ramsey two years ago.

782
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:14,721
Her knee, my balls.

783
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,223
Trust me,
you don't wanna do that.

784
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:20,643
Hey! Ramsey!

785
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:23,646
Hello, Safar.

786
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:27,442
I see you make
some new friends.

787
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:29,527
Yeah, some short-tempered
new friends.

788
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:32,280
I need the speed drive
I sent you. Where is it?

789
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:35,116
Oh, good. You will be
pleased to know I sold it.

790
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,493
You sold it?

791
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:37,744
You hear that?

792
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,162
I asked you to
take care of it.

793
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:40,580
Why on earth
would you sell it?

794
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:42,207
We're gonna need it back.

795
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:44,375
Impossible.

796
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:47,795
Safar, I stashed something
inside it. It's important.

797
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:49,422
Okay, okay.

798
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:51,716
Uh, good news. It is safe.

799
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:53,885
And the bad news?

800
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:56,596
It is very safe.

801
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:59,724
I sold it to a Jordanian
prince living up there.

802
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,100
Trust fund billionaire.

803
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:03,770
Said he wanted to use
it for his supercar.

804
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,313
Now, see, this?

805
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,023
This, I like.

806
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,525
Billionaire, supercar...

807
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:10,360
What makes it so super?

808
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,987
242 miles per hour,
top speed.

809
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:16,032
And it's bulletproof.

810
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:17,534
242...

811
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:20,453
Am I the only one
aroused right now?

812
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:22,497
It's, like, you know
what I'm saying?

813
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:25,208
Whatever.

814
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,960
Where does he keep it?

815
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:28,878
In his penthouse.

816
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:30,505
Tower number one.

817
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:33,800
Now, why in the hell would he
keep his car in his penthouse?

818
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,051
He's a billionaire,
my friend.

819
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,387
He can do whatever he wants.

820
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:40,181
Now, tomorrow happens to be
the longest day of the year.

821
01:07:40,265 --> 01:07:41,391
The prince wants
to celebrate it

822
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:43,351
and host a party
tomorrow afternoon.

823
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:44,769
So you can get us
up there, right?

824
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:46,145
Sure.

825
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,107
But, uh,
not dressed like that.

826
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:19,804
What?

827
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:21,639
Is something wrong?

828
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:22,974
There's a billion
things wrong.

829
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:26,561
But not in this moment.

830
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,605
You look handsome.

831
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:30,732
I feel awkward.

832
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:33,943
You and me both.

833
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:35,778
Just seeing you
dressed like this

834
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:38,364
just reminds me
of something.

835
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,158
Of what?

836
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:44,370
Old times.

837
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:58,384
You okay?

838
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,762
Yeah. I'm fine.

839
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:03,389
Showtime.

840
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:39,676
No, no, no. Listen, man.

841
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:41,844
They're telling me they
party like this every day.

842
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:43,680
On this level,
they party every day.

843
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:45,431
This is crazy. I might
have to move out here.

844
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:48,935
I think I'm gonna start a new
culture. It's called Blarab.

845
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,395
You know,
like "black Arab."

846
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:51,938
How are we looking, Tej?

847
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,106
We're almost in position.

848
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:55,149
Okay, so this is
how it works.

849
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:57,276
We got to move in sync
if we're gonna pull this off.

850
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,695
So let's go over
it to make sure

851
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:00,863
everyone clearly
understands their roles.

852
01:10:00,947 --> 01:10:02,573
Roman, that means you.

853
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:05,159
You know what, you're being real
unprofessional right now, Te;j.

854
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:07,161
The God's Eye chip
is hidden in a speed drive

855
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:08,329
installed in
the prince's car,

856
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:10,123
which he keeps in
a safe room vault.

857
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,125
I make 8 to 10
plainclothes security.

858
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,460
Not to mention the prince

859
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,963
and his personal bodyguards.

860
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,799
Security cameras are clustered
by the north wall. That's where the vault is.

861
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:22,760
We got to get in that vault,
we got to tap into the security system,

862
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:24,554
which can be accessed
in the prince's bedroom.

863
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:25,722
All right, guys,
I'm going in.

864
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:30,059
Excuse me.

865
01:10:31,477 --> 01:10:32,812
Oh, I was just
looking for the...

866
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:34,605
The party is that way.
What?

867
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:35,940
This room is off-limits.

868
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,239
Now,
once we're tapped in,

869
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:45,742
Ramsey and I can hack
into the network and pop the door

870
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:47,285
So you can get in
and get that shit.

871
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:48,995
Wait,
wait, wait. You missed a step.

872
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,247
What about my steps?
What am I supposed to be doing?

873
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,832
No, we didn't miss anything.

874
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:55,042
You're special teams.
So when we need you,

875
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:56,377
do what you do best.

876
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:57,754
And that is?

877
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:02,675
Shine brightly like only
Roman Pearce can do.

878
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:03,760
Ha-ha.

879
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,845
See? Now we talking.

880
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,305
All right, Tej, I'm in.

881
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:08,431
All right,
find the phone jack.

882
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:09,891
The tap always
runs behind that.

883
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:13,060
It's gonna be a 350-megahertz CAT5e cable.

884
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:15,146
They probably got
a couple dozen back there,

885
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:17,023
but this will be the bonded
pair with the plenum coat.

886
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:18,608
English, Tej.

887
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:19,817
It'll be the orange wire.

888
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:23,446
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

889
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:25,239
we are in the pilot seat.

890
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:30,870
All right, Roman.

891
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,872
Do whatever it is you do.

892
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:35,875
It's your birthday, right?

893
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,293
Are you Jasmine?

894
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:39,629
Oh, God, no. Not the birthday routine.
- Take my hand.

895
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:42,173
Happy birthday to you.
This way, this way.

896
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:44,300
Excuse me, so sorry.
I'm coming through, sorry.

897
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,886
Right this way. Listen, excuse me one second.

898
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:49,764
My brother, my brother.
Man, you ain't supposed to...

899
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:51,349
Sir, thank you so much.

900
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:54,644
All right, listen, people.
Please, everybody, gather around.

901
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:56,604
Understand something,
right now.

902
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:58,064
Listen to what
I'm telling y'all.

903
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:02,652
We are here to celebrate
Jasmine's 18th birthday.

904
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:04,654
Happy birthday, my dear.

905
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:09,408
Happy birthday to you

906
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:12,245
To you

907
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:14,956
To you

908
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,917
Oh, I wish I didn't see that.

909
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,339
Ramsey,
open it up for us.

910
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:25,424
Copy that. You're in.

911
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:40,982
Do you realize
what this is?

912
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:43,734
Lykan HyperSport.

913
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:44,944
$3.4 million.

914
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:47,196
Zero-to-60 in less
than three seconds.

915
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,865
There's seven of these
things in the world,

916
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:50,491
and this guy keeps it
locked up in a vault.

917
01:12:50,575 --> 01:12:54,537
Nothing's sadder than locking a beast in a cage.

918
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,998
And now I really want
to punch him in the face.

919
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:58,457
Okay.

920
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:00,585
Let's get to work.

921
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:09,385
You got this, right?

922
01:13:09,468 --> 01:13:10,636
Go.

923
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:31,741
Would you believe I knocked
him out with my charm?

924
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:34,160
You ain't
that charming, bitch.

925
01:13:46,339 --> 01:13:47,924
No, no, no!

926
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:50,092
Tej, your magic trick is failing.
We're losing systems.

927
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:51,135
I know.

928
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:53,638
I see it.

929
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:54,972
Tej, talk to me.

930
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:57,516
I'm trying, but their security
system is locking us out.

931
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,101
All right, listen,
ladies and gentlemen...

932
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,395
Oh, there he is.
These are your dancers?

933
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:02,688
This is a party, baby!

934
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:09,153
Some of y'all probably
went to the bathroom

935
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:11,322
and noticed that all
the hairspray was missing.

936
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:13,032
Yep. She did it.

937
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:14,992
Thank you.

938
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,667
And we're so happy
for you to be here.

939
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:25,670
You look like you got some
missiles underneath that dress. No?

940
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:28,172
He did not just...
Did you just say that?

941
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:42,228
Oh, shit! Not the gate!
Not the gate!

942
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:46,607
Brian, faster!

943
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,067
We're playing all
the defense we can up here

944
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,236
but we're gonna lose.
You gotta hurry up.

945
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:55,074
Thank God you showed up.

946
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:58,953
These parties
bore me to death.

947
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:42,580
Aah!

948
01:15:51,589 --> 01:15:53,090
Guys, get out of
there right now.

949
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:55,009
You've got an army
heading your way.

950
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:56,927
Brian, get out! Forget it!

951
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:00,056
Tej, we're taking the car.

952
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:05,311
This is what I do.
You know what I'm saying? As faras I'm...

953
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:07,146
My man, what's...

954
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:14,904
Letty?

955
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:16,822
Letty, talk to me.
Are you okay?

956
01:16:17,615 --> 01:16:19,283
Guys, I can't hold it.
I'm losing the final gate.

957
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:20,451
You gotta get out of there.

958
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:24,330
Tear out the dash! Go through it.

959
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:31,504
Wait, wait, wait. Now,
just hold on, man.

960
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:45,518
Time to unleash the beast.

961
01:17:06,831 --> 01:17:07,915
Let's go!

962
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:12,628
Stay with me,
I got you.

963
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:14,755
Let's get the hell
out of here.

964
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:56,881
Dom, cars don't fly!

965
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:00,509
Cars don't fly!

966
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:01,677
Holy shit!

967
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:32,708
No brakes!
What?

968
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,961
No brakes!
Shit!

969
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:52,728
No, no, no!

970
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:54,230
No!

971
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:07,826
Oh!

972
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:33,519
Got it!
Get out!

973
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:14,268
Still miss
the bullets, Brian?

974
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:57,227
Ah! There they are. Disaster.
- I'm sorry.

975
01:20:57,394 --> 01:21:01,440
I get you an invite to the most
exclusive party in Abu Dhabi.

976
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:02,649
Safar...
No, no, no.

977
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:06,987
You steal the host's car,
and you jump it between two buildings.

978
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:08,781
Actually, it was three buildings. Oh!

979
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:11,116
Two, insult. Three, honor.

980
01:21:11,283 --> 01:21:12,284
My bad.

981
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:13,952
Well, well, well.

982
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:15,329
I have to say,

983
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:20,376
you've got an interesting interpretation
there of "low-key," Mr. Toretto.

984
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:24,171
You know, Dom,
I thought we had an understanding.

985
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:26,924
Sometimes you have
to play the hand you're dealt.

986
01:21:27,257 --> 01:21:29,426
That's why I prefer
to be the dealer.

987
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:31,470
Good night.

988
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:36,392
Ah!

989
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:40,771
I'm being kicked out of my own
garage. This is great.

990
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:42,981
Uh, may I?

991
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:46,360
Brian,

992
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:48,654
give it to him.

993
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:08,257
All that trouble
for this little

994
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:10,175
thing.

995
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:12,177
With all due respect, Dom,

996
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,179
you really did
great work back there.

997
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:15,556
All of you.

998
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:17,641
All of my men
are now standing by

999
01:22:17,724 --> 01:22:20,727
and are fully
at your disposal.

1000
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,067
Your call.

1001
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:29,736
Ramsey.

1002
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:36,869
Fire it up and
find me Shaw.

1003
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,625
Oh, damn, this is crazy.

1004
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:45,627
Thank you.

1005
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:49,214
All right,
give me a second.

1006
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:53,635
What is it doing now?

1007
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:55,220
It's hunting.

1008
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:57,764
Hacking into the security
cameras at Etihad Towers.

1009
01:22:58,265 --> 01:23:00,267
That's the last place you saw Shaw,
so that's where we'll start.

1010
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:04,521
That's him, right there.

1011
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:06,773
Wait, wait. What are these
numbers right here for?

1012
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:09,026
It's bio-mapping Shaw's face.

1013
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:14,573
It'll run it
against every camera.

1014
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:18,285
Every audio device
in this hemisphere.

1015
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:33,467
Bingo. Looks like
he's holed up here.

1016
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:35,219
That's perfect.

1017
01:23:35,302 --> 01:23:37,679
Automated factory, no people,
lots of places to hide.

1018
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:40,182
You just changed the face
of manhunts forever.

1019
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:43,519
Congratulations.

1020
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:47,689
Hey, can I check
my email real quick?

1021
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:49,858
Dawn's up in two hours.

1022
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:54,530
We're gonna go
take down Shaw then.

1023
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:56,823
Go get changed.

1024
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:02,538
We should go now.

1025
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:06,375
Just you, your team, and me.

1026
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:07,918
I thought you said at dawn.

1027
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:09,086
My guys are racers,

1028
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:10,837
the best drivers
in the world.

1029
01:24:11,004 --> 01:24:12,464
But they ain't killers.

1030
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:14,258
Told you
he'd say that.

1031
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:16,510
I know you too well, Dom,
and I'm going with you.

1032
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:19,429
Well, looks like we got
a nice little hunting party.

1033
01:24:20,222 --> 01:24:21,974
Let's go bag a shadow.

1034
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:31,858
Ten klicks out, boys.
Get ready to rock and roll.

1035
01:24:38,115 --> 01:24:39,992
Here we go. Weapons hot.

1036
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:03,557
You ready for this?
Yeah.

1037
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,714
I hope you're enjoying
your last meal.

1038
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:44,431
This is it?

1039
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:46,600
This is all I warrant?

1040
01:25:47,476 --> 01:25:49,186
A dozen men?

1041
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:51,521
I think you'll find
it's more than enough.

1042
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:07,496
I'm ready
to meet my maker.

1043
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:08,955
Are you?

1044
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:12,376
What were you expecting,
Toretto? To catch me off guard?

1045
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:15,337
Me standing here,
waving a white flag?

1046
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:17,381
You ever heard the saying,

1047
01:26:17,547 --> 01:26:19,007
"The enemy of my enemy

1048
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:20,884
"is my friend"?

1049
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:23,804
I don't have friends.

1050
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,222
I got family.

1051
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:28,934
Well, I got a lot of friends.

1052
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:45,075
Two-two formation!
Sheppard, peel one!

1053
01:26:45,242 --> 01:26:46,284
Roger that.

1054
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:48,096
Brian, leave it!

1055
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:01,943
Get down!

1056
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:15,040
I got you.

1057
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:39,856
God's Eye.

1058
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:01,920
You didn't really think I was gonna
walk in there naked, did you?

1059
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:05,924
You got hit bad.

1060
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:08,051
Look, Toretto.

1061
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:11,012
I know you won't listen to me.

1062
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:14,307
You're not gonna want to
hear what I have to say.

1063
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:16,726
But the truth is,

1064
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:18,520
you really ought to

1065
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:21,565
try that Belgian ale, man.

1066
01:29:21,731 --> 01:29:23,733
It's something special.

1067
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,735
Belgian ale, huh?

1068
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:29,781
Hey,
we gotta get you to a hospital.

1069
01:29:29,948 --> 01:29:31,199
No, you're not.

1070
01:29:31,575 --> 01:29:34,494
I carry my own
health insurance.

1071
01:29:35,161 --> 01:29:39,249
SOCM medics on standby.
They're already inbound.

1072
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:42,168
Pull over, kid.

1073
01:29:56,474 --> 01:29:58,393
Dom,
you gotta protect Ramsey.

1074
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,395
As long as she's alive,

1075
01:30:01,271 --> 01:30:03,523
she can lock them out of God's
Eye, and they know that.

1076
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:06,860
That means they're not gonna
stop coming until they've got her.

1077
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:08,862
And this time,
when they come

1078
01:30:09,029 --> 01:30:11,865
they're gonna come
with everything they've got.

1079
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:13,241
I'm not leaving you.

1080
01:30:13,325 --> 01:30:14,451
You're not.

1081
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:16,870
I'm leaving you.

1082
01:30:19,122 --> 01:30:20,957
Go now, Dom.

1083
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:37,015
A war is coming to us,
whether we like it or not.

1084
01:30:38,350 --> 01:30:40,560
If a war is coming,

1085
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:45,774
we're gonna face them on
the streets we know best.

1086
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:53,782
I'm all for winging it,
but this is crazy, man.

1087
01:30:53,949 --> 01:30:57,077
We got mercenaries with
some real heat on us.

1088
01:30:57,535 --> 01:30:58,828
I mean, I ain't scared
or nothing, but...

1089
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:00,997
Man, I don't
even have a gun!

1090
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:03,917
Gun?

1091
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:06,753
We got a whole city.

1092
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,255
And we may have more than that.
If they use God's Eye,

1093
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:11,716
it'll tap the cameras
around town to find our location.

1094
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:14,386
Which means we could
plant a virus.

1095
01:31:14,552 --> 01:31:16,721
And then break in
when they access it.

1096
01:31:17,222 --> 01:31:19,599
So you're talking about
hacking my hacking device.

1097
01:31:19,766 --> 01:31:20,976
It's brilliant.

1098
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:22,727
Yeah, but there's
one problem.

1099
01:31:22,894 --> 01:31:24,062
The signal strength.

1100
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:27,482
We can't start a hack on them
until they're within a two-mile range.

1101
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:29,693
That's really close.
- Close?

1102
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:30,902
These guys are military.

1103
01:31:31,069 --> 01:31:33,446
If they're within two miles
of us, we're already dead.

1104
01:31:33,613 --> 01:31:38,034
I don't know about y'all,
but I didn't really plan on dying today.

1105
01:31:38,201 --> 01:31:40,161
Only one way
to stay alive.

1106
01:31:41,037 --> 01:31:43,498
We play keep-away with Ramsey. What?

1107
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:44,916
They can't hit
us if we keep moving.

1108
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:46,918
And I'll take Shaw.

1109
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:48,545
So, basically,
we're just gearing up

1110
01:31:48,628 --> 01:31:49,921
for a big game of
hot potato, huh?

1111
01:31:50,088 --> 01:31:51,172
Which car
is the potato?

1112
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:52,257
Girl,
you're the potato.

1113
01:31:52,799 --> 01:31:55,260
Why does it feel like
I'm not gonna see you again?

1114
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:10,650
I'll come back for that.

1115
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:13,194
Promise?

1116
01:32:15,572 --> 01:32:16,906
Promise.

1117
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:38,595
Brian, are you okay?
- Mia, listen to me.

1118
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:41,556
Something's about to go down.

1119
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:43,850
And if you don't hear
from me in 24 hours,

1120
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:49,105
I need you to take
Jack and move on.

1121
01:32:51,441 --> 01:32:52,776
You understand?

1122
01:32:54,194 --> 01:32:55,403
You understand
what I'm saying?

1123
01:32:55,487 --> 01:32:57,363
No, I can't do that, Brian.

1124
01:32:57,614 --> 01:32:59,282
No, I can't.

1125
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:02,744
We're gonna have
another baby.

1126
01:33:03,369 --> 01:33:04,662
It's a little girl.

1127
01:33:07,624 --> 01:33:08,917
And she's going to
need her father.

1128
01:33:09,084 --> 01:33:11,294
So you have to finish
what you're doing

1129
01:33:11,377 --> 01:33:13,838
and you have to
come home to her.

1130
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:15,757
You have to
come home to us.

1131
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:19,844
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you before.

1132
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:24,099
I was scared you'd be
disappointed with domestic life.

1133
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:29,854
You know, the best decision I ever
made was stepping into the store

1134
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:32,065
and buying that
first sandwich.

1135
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:36,820
It was such a bad sandwich.

1136
01:33:38,113 --> 01:33:39,739
I know, right?
But I ate a lot of them.

1137
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:43,701
Uh...

1138
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:51,334
I love you, Mia.

1139
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:55,296
Don't do that.

1140
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:56,673
What?

1141
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:57,841
The way you said it.

1142
01:33:58,007 --> 01:33:59,717
It's like goodbye.
Say something else.

1143
01:34:01,553 --> 01:34:03,346
Okay. Kiss Jack for me.

1144
01:34:05,765 --> 01:34:07,016
I will.

1145
01:34:13,606 --> 01:34:15,483
I love you, Brian.

1146
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:20,280
I love you, Mia.

1147
01:34:52,061 --> 01:34:53,313
One last ride.

1148
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,967
Boot up God's Eye.
Find them.

1149
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:18,982
I'm getting something.

1150
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:24,654
I got a positive ID.
It's Toretto.

1151
01:36:26,197 --> 01:36:28,157
God's Eye is placing him
at Hill and Seventh.

1152
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:33,621
Should we follow him?

1153
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:35,665
No. Let Shaw
take care of him.

1154
01:36:35,832 --> 01:36:36,874
Find Ramsey.

1155
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:37,959
Yes, sir.

1156
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:47,176
I don't know why we
gotta keep driving around like this.

1157
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:48,886
Why can't we just
pull over somewhere,

1158
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:51,597
park, gather our thoughts in,
like, a bunker somewhere?

1159
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:53,266
Because it does not
work like that.

1160
01:36:53,599 --> 01:36:55,310
We gotta stick close
enough to the bad guys

1161
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:57,520
in order to get in range
for Ramsey to hack them.

1162
01:36:57,603 --> 01:37:00,440
But we gotta be mobile enough
not to get shot like fish in a barrel.

1163
01:37:00,523 --> 01:37:01,983
So, do me a favor,
focus on the mission

1164
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:03,484
and keep us from
getting killed.

1165
01:37:05,194 --> 01:37:06,988
Got her. Target acquired.

1166
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:08,948
She's riding shotgun
in a blue GT-R.

1167
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:18,291
Guys, they're here.

1168
01:37:18,791 --> 01:37:19,792
How many cars?

1169
01:37:19,876 --> 01:37:20,918
Uh, none.

1170
01:37:21,127 --> 01:37:22,712
And that's kind
of the problem.

1171
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:31,637
Okay, let's give
them the tour.

1172
01:37:31,721 --> 01:37:32,847
Break on my mark.

1173
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:35,016
Three, two, one.

1174
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:36,225
Go!

1175
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:41,481
Splitting up won't work.

1176
01:37:41,647 --> 01:37:43,316
Can't hide from God's Eye.

1177
01:37:47,278 --> 01:37:48,279
They're in range.

1178
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:50,031
Ramsey, start the hack.

1179
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:51,532
Initiating.

1180
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:53,451
Now.

1181
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:57,955
Sir, I think someone's
trying to hack the system.

1182
01:37:58,706 --> 01:37:59,874
It's Ramsey.

1183
01:38:00,041 --> 01:38:01,250
Send in the Predator!

1184
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:02,543
Take her out!

1185
01:38:02,752 --> 01:38:04,462
Releasing Predator.

1186
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:37,328
I think we lost the chopper.

1187
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:45,336
I think we got
bigger problems than that!

1188
01:38:47,296 --> 01:38:48,631
Oh, my God.

1189
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:51,759
What are you doing?

1190
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:52,969
We're going old school!

1191
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,685
Watch out!

1192
01:40:15,134 --> 01:40:16,177
It's coming
back around!

1193
01:40:29,065 --> 01:40:30,191
Predator's back on him.

1194
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:32,276
Ready missiles!
- Roger that.

1195
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:35,363
Fire!

1196
01:40:36,447 --> 01:40:37,448
Oh, shit!

1197
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:48,751
Football's hot!
I need to lateral!

1198
01:40:48,834 --> 01:40:50,044
Rom, where are you?

1199
01:40:50,127 --> 01:40:51,462
Running back charging in!

1200
01:41:10,022 --> 01:41:12,400
Meet me on Third and Spring.
You got it!

1201
01:41:19,574 --> 01:41:20,700
I'm halfway there.

1202
01:41:20,866 --> 01:41:21,993
Grab your computer!
Get in the window!

1203
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:23,286
Why?
Do it! Now!

1204
01:41:28,666 --> 01:41:30,001
You gotta go! Right now!

1205
01:41:34,422 --> 01:41:35,840
Fire!

1206
01:41:46,392 --> 01:41:47,476
Come on!

1207
01:42:06,287 --> 01:42:07,705
Hit!

1208
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:12,293
He made it!

1209
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:14,128
I can't believe
we pulled that off.

1210
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:23,429
Wait, wait, wait.
We're still being hacked. What?

1211
01:42:23,512 --> 01:42:25,348
God's Eye is
still tracking Ramsey.

1212
01:42:25,431 --> 01:42:26,932
Keep the drone
in pursuit of her.

1213
01:42:27,016 --> 01:42:28,559
The signal has to be
coming from somewhere.

1214
01:43:05,721 --> 01:43:05,763
Back to throw.
Here comes the blitz. Number 94 sacks him!

1215
01:43:05,763 --> 01:43:08,391
Back to throw.
Here comes the blitz. Number 94 sacks him!

1216
01:43:08,474 --> 01:43:10,851
Breaking news
out of Los Angeles tonight.

1217
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:13,854
In what can only be described
as vehicular warfare,

1218
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:15,731
police are engaged in
a high-speed pursuit...

1219
01:43:18,651 --> 01:43:20,152
I got it. They're
piggybacking the hack

1220
01:43:20,236 --> 01:43:21,654
off that satellite
tower right there.

1221
01:43:21,737 --> 01:43:23,239
Take it out!

1222
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:35,918
Toretto.

1223
01:43:45,177 --> 01:43:47,054
Wait. What happened?
We were almost there.

1224
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:49,473
They've cut the signal!
I can't finish the hack!

1225
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:50,558
What do you mean?

1226
01:43:52,518 --> 01:43:54,019
Brian, they took out
the tower!

1227
01:43:58,983 --> 01:44:01,569
Dad,
what's going on?

1228
01:44:02,737 --> 01:44:04,196
Daddy's gotta go to work.

1229
01:44:22,381 --> 01:44:23,466
All right, baby girl.

1230
01:44:23,632 --> 01:44:25,342
Elena's gonna be here
in a little bit.

1231
01:44:25,509 --> 01:44:26,761
You know our drill.

1232
01:44:26,844 --> 01:44:28,179
Give me three for the road.

1233
01:44:46,864 --> 01:44:48,908
You thought this was
gonna be a street fight?

1234
01:45:03,589 --> 01:45:05,382
You're goddamn right it is.

1235
01:45:51,846 --> 01:45:52,888
There has to be another way.

1236
01:45:52,972 --> 01:45:54,348
Wait. I'm seeing
half a dozen

1237
01:45:54,431 --> 01:45:56,559
cell towers between
Sixth and State.

1238
01:45:56,642 --> 01:45:57,852
Brian, if you can
get to the top

1239
01:45:57,935 --> 01:45:59,520
of any one of those
buildings around there,

1240
01:45:59,603 --> 01:46:01,814
we can reroute the signal
manually and finish the job.

1241
01:46:01,897 --> 01:46:02,898
I'm on it.

1242
01:46:06,193 --> 01:46:07,319
Sir, did you hear that?

1243
01:46:07,403 --> 01:46:09,405
O'Conner is on foot,
heading for a repeater.

1244
01:46:09,488 --> 01:46:10,906
He's going to try to
reinitiate the hack.

1245
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:11,991
Keep the drone on the girl.

1246
01:46:13,534 --> 01:46:14,535
Kiet,

1247
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:16,579
O'Conner's on foot somewhere
between Sixth and State.

1248
01:46:17,037 --> 01:46:18,455
Don't let him make it there.

1249
01:46:33,637 --> 01:46:34,638
Them boys is on us!

1250
01:46:34,722 --> 01:46:36,223
Man, them boys
ain't ready for this!

1251
01:46:41,270 --> 01:46:42,479
Shit!

1252
01:47:00,998 --> 01:47:02,958
First the tank,
then the plane.

1253
01:47:03,042 --> 01:47:04,335
Now we got a spaceship?

1254
01:47:04,376 --> 01:47:06,587
That's not a spaceship,
that's a drone! Oh, it's a drone?

1255
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:08,505
Now, you gonna break it down
and be articulate

1256
01:47:08,589 --> 01:47:10,466
like you already know
what the hell is going on?

1257
01:47:10,549 --> 01:47:12,259
Shut your ass up
and drive the car!

1258
01:47:18,933 --> 01:47:20,684
Letty, the football's
on fire!

1259
01:47:20,768 --> 01:47:21,769
We need help!

1260
01:47:23,437 --> 01:47:24,480
Hang on! I'm coming!

1261
01:48:00,099 --> 01:48:01,475
Ramsey, get ready
to go again!

1262
01:48:04,478 --> 01:48:06,438
Drone has missile lock.
Fire!

1263
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:17,408
Target destroyed.

1264
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:23,497
Let's see if we
have a connection. If I can get back in...

1265
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:24,790
Wait, wait, wait!
God's Eye still has her.

1266
01:48:24,873 --> 01:48:26,000
How can that be?

1267
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:42,474
Get up. Come on!

1268
01:48:43,517 --> 01:48:44,518
Let's go! Let's go!

1269
01:48:48,522 --> 01:48:50,774
They switched her under the bridge. What?

1270
01:48:53,777 --> 01:48:56,280
Gotta get out of here.
It's on your trail and it's coming fast.

1271
01:48:56,363 --> 01:48:57,364
Got it.

1272
01:48:57,448 --> 01:49:00,117
So, if this car goes down,
who's coming to save us?

1273
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:02,453
Save us, honey?
We're it.

1274
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:03,537
Where are they now?

1275
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:04,955
Six blocks east,
hauling ass.

1276
01:49:06,290 --> 01:49:07,458
Where are we
headed, Tej?

1277
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:09,752
There's a service elevator
past the maintenance sector.

1278
01:49:09,835 --> 01:49:11,962
It'll take you
directly up to the repeater.

1279
01:49:12,046 --> 01:49:13,464
Brian, you gotta hurry!

1280
01:51:14,334 --> 01:51:15,419
Too slow!

1281
01:51:31,059 --> 01:51:32,060
It's coming back!

1282
01:51:32,144 --> 01:51:33,228
We'll lose them
in the tunnel.

1283
01:51:34,605 --> 01:51:35,939
Got it.
Fire!

1284
01:51:52,873 --> 01:51:54,333
I can't shake this thing!

1285
01:51:57,461 --> 01:51:59,338
Predator has missile lock.

1286
01:51:59,421 --> 01:52:00,964
Take it out!

1287
01:52:27,074 --> 01:52:28,116
No way.

1288
01:52:39,544 --> 01:52:40,963
Wait! What happened?

1289
01:52:41,338 --> 01:52:43,715
Sir, someone just
double-tapped our drone.

1290
01:52:43,799 --> 01:52:44,883
What?

1291
01:52:46,927 --> 01:52:48,512
Hey, did you bring
the cavalry?

1292
01:52:49,346 --> 01:52:51,848
Woman, I am the cavalry.

1293
01:52:52,849 --> 01:52:54,017
Of course you are.

1294
01:52:55,143 --> 01:52:56,270
Who is that?

1295
01:52:59,564 --> 01:53:00,816
That's Hobbs.

1296
01:53:09,658 --> 01:53:10,742
I'm at the repeater.

1297
01:53:10,826 --> 01:53:12,035
The access cable's
in the base.

1298
01:53:12,494 --> 01:53:15,247
Just plug it into your phone
and Ramsey will be back online.

1299
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,041
Ramsey, go!

1300
01:53:22,379 --> 01:53:24,214
Brian did it. We're back in!

1301
01:53:29,428 --> 01:53:30,721
We've got God's Eye back.

1302
01:53:38,353 --> 01:53:39,438
We lost the God's Eye!

1303
01:53:39,604 --> 01:53:40,981
What? Shit!

1304
01:53:45,944 --> 01:53:48,363
Military's inbound.
Three minutes and closing.

1305
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:49,698
We need to get
the hell out of here.

1306
01:53:52,117 --> 01:53:53,869
Tej, Roman, I'm on my way!

1307
01:53:54,202 --> 01:53:55,454
All right, homie,
I'll see you there.

1308
01:54:43,043 --> 01:54:44,628
I have eyes on Toretto.

1309
01:55:05,065 --> 01:55:06,233
Shaw is in the way.

1310
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,777
Then it seems our
friendship is at an end.

1311
01:55:09,611 --> 01:55:10,612
Do it!

1312
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:27,963
Thing about street fights,

1313
01:55:30,424 --> 01:55:32,342
the street always wins.

1314
01:56:00,370 --> 01:56:02,205
Goodbye, Toretto.

1315
01:56:10,547 --> 01:56:12,716
Take him out!
Take down the bastard!

1316
01:56:22,684 --> 01:56:23,685
This son of a...

1317
01:56:38,366 --> 01:56:39,493
No!

1318
01:56:40,368 --> 01:56:41,828
Duck!

1319
01:56:41,912 --> 01:56:44,956
I need some help over here!
We're getting nailed!

1320
01:56:45,332 --> 01:56:47,042
I need some backup!

1321
01:56:55,217 --> 01:56:57,761
No! No! Son of a bitch!

1322
01:57:00,013 --> 01:57:01,348
He's getting away!

1323
01:57:01,431 --> 01:57:02,974
No! Stop him!

1324
01:57:58,738 --> 01:57:59,739
Don't miss.

1325
01:58:33,398 --> 01:58:34,399
Dom!

1326
01:59:19,986 --> 01:59:21,905
Come on, buddy.

1327
01:59:27,285 --> 01:59:28,328
Is he breathing?

1328
01:59:28,495 --> 01:59:30,497
I want you to keep his head
tilted up, all right?

1329
01:59:30,664 --> 01:59:32,082
Keep it back like this.

1330
01:59:32,248 --> 01:59:34,292
Pinch his nose, keep his head tilted.
Breathe into him, now. Go.

1331
01:59:35,669 --> 01:59:36,670
Good. Come on, Dom.

1332
01:59:37,295 --> 01:59:39,005
Come on, Dom. Come on!

1333
01:59:39,172 --> 01:59:40,965
God damn it!
You come on! You breathe!

1334
01:59:41,132 --> 01:59:42,425
Go, go! Breathe.

1335
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:43,635
Come on. Damn it. Let's go.

1336
01:59:43,718 --> 01:59:47,514
Come on, Dom, I need you to breathe.
Come on! Come on, Dom!

1337
01:59:47,597 --> 01:59:49,015
Come back! Come on, buddy.

1338
01:59:49,099 --> 01:59:50,392
Stop it.
Dom, come on! Come on!

1339
01:59:50,475 --> 01:59:51,476
Back off!

1340
01:59:51,559 --> 01:59:52,894
Will you stop?
Breathe into him.

1341
01:59:52,977 --> 01:59:54,896
Get off of him!
You breathe into him!

1342
01:59:54,979 --> 01:59:56,690
Back off!
You breathe into him!

1343
01:59:56,773 --> 01:59:58,149
Back off!

1344
01:59:59,234 --> 02:00:00,443
Please.

1345
02:00:01,528 --> 02:00:02,862
Dom.

1346
02:00:02,946 --> 02:00:05,699
Dom, baby. I know
you're hurting right now.

1347
02:00:06,324 --> 02:00:09,035
But I want you to listen.
Stay awake

1348
02:00:09,953 --> 02:00:11,496
and focus on me.

1349
02:00:17,210 --> 02:00:19,713
I remember everything.

1350
02:00:20,505 --> 02:00:22,298
It came to me like a flood.

1351
02:00:24,676 --> 02:00:28,012
I remember that night
in the Dominican Republic.

1352
02:00:29,305 --> 02:00:30,807
The night we got married.

1353
02:00:37,272 --> 02:00:38,481
Oh, my...

1354
02:00:43,486 --> 02:00:44,654
Will this do?

1355
02:00:48,658 --> 02:00:50,827
We have eternity
in this moment.

1356
02:00:51,745 --> 02:00:54,330
You will never be alone again.

1357
02:00:54,497 --> 02:00:57,000
I vow wherever you go, I go.

1358
02:00:57,167 --> 02:00:58,585
You ride, I ride.

1359
02:00:58,752 --> 02:01:00,503
You fight, I fight.

1360
02:01:00,670 --> 02:01:03,047
And if you ever die on me,
Dominic Toretto,

1361
02:01:03,548 --> 02:01:04,799
I'm gonna die with you.

1362
02:01:08,845 --> 02:01:11,055
I love you, Letty.
I will always love you.

1363
02:01:11,765 --> 02:01:14,392
If you die, I die.

1364
02:01:17,187 --> 02:01:19,439
And I'm not ready to
leave this place yet.

1365
02:01:20,356 --> 02:01:23,234
This moment is still ours.

1366
02:01:28,198 --> 02:01:30,366
I remember everything.

1367
02:01:31,034 --> 02:01:32,702
I remember it all.

1368
02:01:34,704 --> 02:01:36,873
It's about time.

1369
02:01:51,513 --> 02:01:54,182
Why didn't you tell me
we were married?

1370
02:02:02,273 --> 02:02:05,568
Because you can't tell
someone they love you.

1371
02:02:15,662 --> 02:02:16,996
Holy shit.

1372
02:02:42,856 --> 02:02:45,942
You sure you brought enough
backup with you, Hobbs?

1373
02:02:46,484 --> 02:02:47,986
Oh, they ain't mine.

1374
02:02:48,945 --> 02:02:50,613
They're here to protect you

1375
02:02:51,531 --> 02:02:53,449
from me killing your ass.

1376
02:03:09,674 --> 02:03:12,302
You do know none of this
will keep me, right?

1377
02:03:16,681 --> 02:03:19,726
Well, once you dig through
38 feet of concrete and steel,

1378
02:03:19,809 --> 02:03:23,646
my fist and a body bag will be
waiting for you on the other side.

1379
02:03:24,314 --> 02:03:26,482
So I suggest you
get to digging, boy.

1380
02:04:01,184 --> 02:04:02,185
Whoo-hoo!

1381
02:04:03,603 --> 02:04:05,021
Daddy! Come play.

1382
02:04:05,396 --> 02:04:06,439
Yeah.

1383
02:04:06,522 --> 02:04:08,191
Look at him. Look at him.

1384
02:04:10,860 --> 02:04:11,861
Yeah, buddy.

1385
02:04:13,571 --> 02:04:15,031
Duty calls.
- It does.

1386
02:04:15,114 --> 02:04:16,115
Hey, babe, come on.

1387
02:04:16,741 --> 02:04:18,618
Let's get Mama. Yeah!

1388
02:04:18,785 --> 02:04:19,786
Here we go.

1389
02:04:19,869 --> 02:04:23,331
Because the sun is out,
I'm kind of medium rare,

1390
02:04:23,414 --> 02:04:27,085
but I can get, like, well done. Like, really dark.

1391
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:29,545
What you nudging me for?

1392
02:04:29,629 --> 02:04:31,214
Close your mouth
for two seconds.

1393
02:04:32,882 --> 02:04:35,093
Just open your eyes, man.

1394
02:04:38,596 --> 02:04:39,722
Beautiful.

1395
02:04:41,391 --> 02:04:43,434
That's where he belongs.

1396
02:04:43,935 --> 02:04:45,561
Home.

1397
02:04:47,063 --> 02:04:48,648
Where he's always belonged.

1398
02:04:53,903 --> 02:04:56,572
Things are gonna
be different now.

1399
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:20,680
One more time.

1400
02:05:23,224 --> 02:05:25,226
You aren't going
to say goodbye?

1401
02:05:36,612 --> 02:05:38,948
It's never goodbye.

1402
02:05:40,616 --> 02:05:44,287
It's been a long day

1403
02:05:44,787 --> 02:05:46,789
Without you, my friend

1404
02:05:47,457 --> 02:05:52,920
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

1405
02:05:53,379 --> 02:05:56,132
We've come a long way

1406
02:05:56,632 --> 02:05:58,968
From where we began

1407
02:05:59,135 --> 02:06:04,599
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

1408
02:06:04,974 --> 02:06:07,602
When I see you again

1409
02:06:11,481 --> 02:06:14,484
First you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong

1410
02:06:14,567 --> 02:06:15,818
And what's small
turn to a friendship

1411
02:06:15,985 --> 02:06:17,403
A friendship turn into a bond

1412
02:06:17,487 --> 02:06:18,905
And that bond
will never be broken

1413
02:06:18,988 --> 02:06:20,656
The love will
never get lost

1414
02:06:20,740 --> 02:06:22,742
And the love
will never get lost

1415
02:06:23,242 --> 02:06:24,827
And when brotherhood
come first

1416
02:06:24,911 --> 02:06:26,496
Then the line
will never be crossed

1417
02:06:26,579 --> 02:06:29,457
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn

1418
02:06:29,540 --> 02:06:32,543
And that line is what we reach
So remember me when I'm gone

1419
02:06:32,794 --> 02:06:35,171
It's been a long day

1420
02:06:35,797 --> 02:06:37,924
Without you, my friend

1421
02:06:38,424 --> 02:06:43,888
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again

1422
02:06:44,847 --> 02:06:46,849
When I see you again

1423
02:06:47,850 --> 02:06:50,186
Hey. You thought you could
leave without saying goodbye?

1424
02:06:57,944 --> 02:07:00,571
I used to say I live
my life a quarter-mile at a time.

1425
02:07:02,865 --> 02:07:05,618
And I think that's
why we were brothers.

1426
02:07:06,410 --> 02:07:08,079
Because you did, too.

1427
02:07:10,164 --> 02:07:11,916
This is your car.
My car?

1428
02:07:18,339 --> 02:07:19,298
It's official.

1429
02:07:19,382 --> 02:07:20,424
You're all free.

1430
02:07:20,716 --> 02:07:22,802
Home sweet home.

1431
02:07:25,596 --> 02:07:27,265
What's happening, dude?
Thanks for the invite.

1432
02:07:32,395 --> 02:07:33,771
Wanna go for a drive?

1433
02:07:35,606 --> 02:07:36,816
No matter where you are,

1434
02:07:38,276 --> 02:07:40,570
whether it's
a quarter-mile away

1435
02:07:41,612 --> 02:07:44,240
or halfway across the world,

1436
02:07:50,163 --> 02:07:51,747
the most important
thing in life

1437
02:07:51,831 --> 02:07:53,916
will always be the
people in this room.

1438
02:07:54,083 --> 02:07:56,252
Right here, right now.

1439
02:07:56,586 --> 02:07:57,920
Salud mi familia.

1440
02:07:58,087 --> 02:07:59,255
Salud.

1441
02:08:07,597 --> 02:08:09,182
You'll always be with me.

1442
02:08:11,475 --> 02:08:13,936
And you'll always
be my brother.

1443
02:08:14,270 --> 02:08:17,732
How could we not talk about family
when family's all that we got?

1444
02:08:17,815 --> 02:08:20,693
Everything I went through you
were standing there by my side

1445
02:08:20,776 --> 02:08:23,446
And now you gonna be
there for the last ride

1446
02:08:26,157 --> 02:08:29,452
How could we not talk about family
when family's all that we got?

1447
02:08:29,702 --> 02:08:32,663
Everything I went through you
were standing there by my side

1448
02:08:32,747 --> 02:08:35,625
And now you gonna be
with me for the last ride

1449
02:08:35,708 --> 02:08:38,294
And now you gonna be
there for the last ride

1450
02:08:39,128 --> 02:08:40,796
I'll tell you

1451
02:08:41,714 --> 02:08:43,591
Yeah, we came a long way

1452
02:08:46,427 --> 02:08:48,095
I'll see you again
