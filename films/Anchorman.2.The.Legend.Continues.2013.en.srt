1
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,611
<i>Ron Burgundy,
for years he was</i>

2
00:00:56,695 --> 00:00:59,239
<i>the prophet San Diego
turned to for its news.</i>

3
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:03,284
<i>But then, like a shimmering
comet, he disappeared.</i>

4
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:05,120
<i>So where does
the next chapter</i>

5
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:07,247
<i>of the legend of
Ron Burgundy begin?</i>

6
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,166
<i>It begins in a place
where all great men go</i>

7
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,502
<i>for the second
act of their life,</i>

8
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:14,796
<i>New York City!</i>

9
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:33,606
Ron Burgundy!

10
00:01:33,857 --> 00:01:35,817
Your lady's got an ass that
looks like a diamond

11
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,902
wrapped in hundred dollar bills.

12
00:01:38,403 --> 00:01:39,923
You know there's two
things daddy likes

13
00:01:39,988 --> 00:01:42,198
is diamonds and hundred
dollar bills, baby.

14
00:01:42,907 --> 00:01:44,367
And white women.

15
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:46,752
Ron, aren't you going to
say something to him?

16
00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:49,539
Hey, when you've got an ass
like a piece of Bubblicious,

17
00:01:49,664 --> 00:01:51,833
people are going to want to
stop and chew on it.

18
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:54,419
<i>It was a time before
cell phones</i>

19
00:01:54,502 --> 00:01:58,506
<i>and when Google and Twitter were
sounds made by monkeys and babies.</i>

20
00:01:59,132 --> 00:02:00,508
Chop suey.

21
00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:02,093
"Chop suey," says Choppy.

22
00:02:02,177 --> 00:02:03,845
Chop suey.

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,597
Mickey Mouse shrieked in pain

24
00:02:05,722 --> 00:02:07,682
as the bear trap
severed his right leg.

25
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,350
<i>Chuck-wan.</i>

26
00:02:10,393 --> 00:02:13,188
Wendy wore her wedding dress
to the orgy.

27
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:16,399
Wendy wore her wedding
dress to the orgy. Orgy.

28
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:20,695
Corningstone.
Corningstone.

29
00:02:22,238 --> 00:02:24,699
Oh, my God! Oh, no!

30
00:02:26,534 --> 00:02:27,994
He's getting close!

31
00:02:28,995 --> 00:02:30,997
Oh, no!

32
00:02:32,248 --> 00:02:34,417
He died too young!

33
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:35,960
Five, four...

34
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:38,505
- Have a great broadcast.
- You, too, darling.

35
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:42,383
Good evening.

36
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:45,345
<i>This is the weekend edition
of WBC News at 6:30.</i>

37
00:02:45,678 --> 00:02:46,971
I'm Ron Burgundy.

38
00:02:47,055 --> 00:02:48,515
And I'm Veronica Corningstone.

39
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:50,058
Our top story tonight.

40
00:02:50,183 --> 00:02:51,684
The U.N. today announced
sanctions against...

41
00:02:51,893 --> 00:02:53,394
When the broadcast is over,

42
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,897
send these two up to my office.

43
00:02:56,231 --> 00:02:58,233
Time to make a change.

44
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,866
Rumor has it that after 35
years of manning the helm,

45
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,869
Mack Tannen is thinking
about stepping down.

46
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:12,163
That's right.

47
00:03:12,247 --> 00:03:14,791
Do you...
Do you think we could be...

48
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:16,918
<i>We could be getting
the Nightly News, Ron?</i>

49
00:03:18,253 --> 00:03:20,054
I think that's exactly
what's about to happen.

50
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:21,889
Oh, my God. That's
what's happening, isn't it?

51
00:03:22,131 --> 00:03:23,967
- Do you know what this means?
- Yes, I do.

52
00:03:24,092 --> 00:03:25,453
Our lives will be changed forever.

53
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:26,803
Forever.

54
00:03:26,964 --> 00:03:28,364
We can finally buy
that speed boat.

55
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:30,056
- We could.
- We could have twenty kids.

56
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:33,393
Or two.
We could have two children.

57
00:03:33,726 --> 00:03:35,270
You can constantly be pregnant.

58
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:36,604
With a surrogate.

59
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:38,106
What's a surrogate?

60
00:03:38,273 --> 00:03:43,278
Oh, my sweet,
mouth-breathing goon.

61
00:03:43,444 --> 00:03:45,822
My lightly sautéed veal outlet.

62
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,408
Oh, my giant asshole.

63
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:52,287
Mr. Tannen,
you are an inspiration, sir.

64
00:03:52,912 --> 00:03:57,292
I've been doing the evening
news now for over 35 years.

65
00:03:57,625 --> 00:03:59,335
- Done a hell of a job.
- Yes, sir.

66
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,503
A hell of a job!

67
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:06,134
I've covered assassinations,
wars, famines, plagues.

68
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:07,594
Never good.

69
00:04:07,677 --> 00:04:09,762
I have a nasty pill addiction.

70
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:12,891
You should try switching to alcohol.

71
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:14,475
It's really great.

72
00:04:15,727 --> 00:04:17,353
The point is,

73
00:04:17,812 --> 00:04:19,856
this is a very demanding job.

74
00:04:20,023 --> 00:04:21,024
Yes.

75
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:23,610
But I'm close to thinking that

76
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:26,279
you may have what it takes.

77
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:29,532
Now, let me look at you.

78
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,828
Oh, my God.

79
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:41,544
What are you?

80
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:44,047
Finnish?

81
00:04:44,213 --> 00:04:47,634
Oddly enough,
I'm 90% Chicano, 10% Inuit.

82
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:49,052
None of that is true, Ron.

83
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:53,514
Well, I'm Dutch-German with
a dash of Cherokee.

84
00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:55,975
I'm so nervous.

85
00:04:58,144 --> 00:05:00,188
You can take her for
a test drive if you like.

86
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:05,026
That's a one spicy meatball, huh!

87
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:08,237
Sorry.

88
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:11,658
All right.

89
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:16,079
We're about to make

90
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:18,539
network news history.

91
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,875
- Veronica.
- Yes?

92
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:24,921
You're going to be the
first female full-time

93
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:26,839
network news anchor.

94
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:29,384
- Oh, my goodness!
- I knew it.

95
00:05:29,717 --> 00:05:31,219
And you, Mr. Burgundy...

96
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:35,056
Thank you, yes. The first
left-handed baritone.

97
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,392
- Mr. Burgundy.
- Yes?

98
00:05:37,725 --> 00:05:39,060
You're fired.

99
00:05:39,394 --> 00:05:40,561
Come again?

100
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:42,021
Fired.

101
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:45,566
I'm sorry, it just didn't work out.

102
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:48,069
You don't seem sorry.

103
00:05:48,528 --> 00:05:52,365
You are the worst anchorman

104
00:05:52,907 --> 00:05:54,701
I have ever seen.

105
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:58,037
But what did I do wrong?
Name one thing.

106
00:05:58,538 --> 00:06:00,748
The injured police officer was
immediately transferred

107
00:06:00,873 --> 00:06:02,250
to an amber-lance.

108
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,252
Amboolance

109
00:06:04,585 --> 00:06:07,005
An am... Ambrulance.

110
00:06:07,088 --> 00:06:09,257
I can't say it. You ever have that?

111
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:13,928
A word you can't get?
I have trouble with broccoli.

112
00:06:14,303 --> 00:06:18,725
Broccoli has always been hard
for me to say. Broccoli.

113
00:06:19,308 --> 00:06:21,728
The slain civil rights leader
was eulogized...

114
00:06:23,604 --> 00:06:26,941
Oh, wow! Did you see that?
Right on the lens!

115
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,850
That doesn't happen every day.

116
00:06:28,943 --> 00:06:30,278
That's a lot of bacteria.

117
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:32,822
I'm sorry, sweetie,
you're the best. Quick kiss.

118
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:37,326
Fuck's sake.

119
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,079
Now, I know this is tricky,
given your relationship,

120
00:06:40,621 --> 00:06:43,082
so I'm going to give you
the evening to think about it.

121
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:44,876
I forbid it!

122
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:48,880
You forbid it? What?
Who are you? Julius Caesar?

123
00:06:49,172 --> 00:06:50,715
Who the hell is Julius Caesar?

124
00:06:50,798 --> 00:06:54,302
Do you mean Dr. J.? Dr. Julius
Caesar the basketball player?

125
00:06:54,635 --> 00:06:56,471
You... Be quiet.

126
00:06:57,305 --> 00:06:58,305
Mom?

127
00:06:58,347 --> 00:07:00,058
I'm sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Burgundy.

128
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:01,184
He no go to sleep.

129
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,811
Christ, Lupita!
What are you doing downstairs?

130
00:07:03,895 --> 00:07:05,229
Stay in your quarters.

131
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:08,691
Mommy? Daddy? Why are you
yelling at each other?

132
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:11,152
Did Dad drink too
much white wine again?

133
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,696
Walter, honey, why don't you
just go to bed, all right?

134
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:16,157
Mommy and Daddy are
just having a discussion.

135
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:17,867
No! He needs to hear this.

136
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:20,536
He's six years old. He's a man.

137
00:07:21,537 --> 00:07:24,082
Walter, listen to me.

138
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:27,919
Are you looking at me? Walter!

139
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:32,090
Walter! Walter!

140
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:35,176
- He's looking at you, Ron.
- Okay, I can't tell.

141
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:37,845
Life isn't a fairy tale. Okay?

142
00:07:38,221 --> 00:07:42,058
It's not "Let's play Candy Land
and take a three-hour dump. "

143
00:07:42,183 --> 00:07:43,267
It's complicated.

144
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:44,852
It's about getting a paycheck

145
00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:46,376
and keeping a gun
out of your mouth.

146
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:48,856
- He is a child, Ron!
- Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah!

147
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:52,026
He's got hair on his nugs.
He's old enough to hear this.

148
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:55,029
Sometimes in life, you're
going to have to drink

149
00:07:55,113 --> 00:07:59,200
a big, fat, stinking bowl
of hot, frothy horse piss!

150
00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:01,536
- Am I getting through to you?
- Ron!

151
00:08:01,702 --> 00:08:03,704
I don't want to drink horse piss!

152
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:07,375
Walter, honey, it's okay. All right.

153
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:11,129
This is some sort of metaphor
that your father is using.

154
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:13,965
It's going to be hot,
and frothy, and pungent,

155
00:08:14,048 --> 00:08:16,467
and it's going to spill down
the front of your shirt...

156
00:08:16,551 --> 00:08:17,927
Stop it, Ron!

157
00:08:18,052 --> 00:08:20,096
People are going to
be laughing at you!

158
00:08:20,471 --> 00:08:23,641
Oh, they'll be laughing!

159
00:08:23,766 --> 00:08:27,228
I don't want to drink foamy,
hot horse piss!

160
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:29,355
Oh, yes, you will.
You will gulp it down.

161
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:32,483
And then, ironically,
you'll develop a thirst

162
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:35,319
as if you were alone
in the Sahara Desert.

163
00:08:35,611 --> 00:08:37,238
It'll be the only thing on your mind.

164
00:08:37,321 --> 00:08:38,781
"Got to have more horse piss. "

165
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:42,410
One time, Fidel Castro made
my father drink horse piss.

166
00:08:42,994 --> 00:08:44,674
Lupita, you are not
helping the situation.

167
00:08:44,787 --> 00:08:47,582
Is Castro going to make me
drink horse piss?

168
00:08:47,748 --> 00:08:48,958
Damn it, Ron!

169
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,751
It happens all over the world.

170
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:55,506
We will never, ever
make you drink hot horse piss.

171
00:08:55,673 --> 00:08:57,341
I promise you that.

172
00:08:57,425 --> 00:09:00,469
Listen, son, I've heard
those same exact words!

173
00:09:01,095 --> 00:09:03,931
And guess what? I always
have to drink the horse piss!

174
00:09:04,098 --> 00:09:06,893
He's right. I always have to
drink the horse piss.

175
00:09:06,976 --> 00:09:08,769
I will lock you in a closet.

176
00:09:08,936 --> 00:09:11,147
Burns your throat coming down

177
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:13,774
and it burns your keester coming out.

178
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:16,611
I don't want to drink horse piss!

179
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:19,989
Veronica, here's the bottom line.

180
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:21,949
It's a very simple decision.

181
00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:27,121
It's either me or the job.

182
00:09:27,705 --> 00:09:30,124
It doesn't have to be a choice, Ron.

183
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:32,168
Don't do this.

184
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,339
Don't throw away everything
that we've worked so hard for.

185
00:09:36,964 --> 00:09:38,299
Me

186
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:40,760
Or the job.

187
00:09:55,816 --> 00:09:57,902
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the 3:10</i>

188
00:09:57,985 --> 00:09:59,779
<i>Dolphin Show at Sea World.</i>

189
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:01,322
<i>Sponsored by Enron.</i>

190
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:04,909
<i>Enron, meeting your energy needs
now and forever.</i>

191
00:10:04,992 --> 00:10:07,578
<i>Here's your host, Ron Burgundy.</i>

192
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:10,665
<i>Good afternoon, everyone.</i>

193
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:13,668
<i>And welcome
to world-famous Sea World,</i>

194
00:10:13,876 --> 00:10:16,712
<i>here in San Diago, California.</i>

195
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:19,548
<i>Folks, you're going to learn
a lot about sea life today.</i>

196
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:23,052
<i>You're also going to learn
a lot about human despair.</i>

197
00:10:24,095 --> 00:10:26,430
<i>And your teacher's going to be me.</i>

198
00:10:27,014 --> 00:10:29,767
<i>You're also going to learn that in a pinch</i>

199
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:33,437
<i>you can fit an entire ham sandwich
in your butt crack.</i>

200
00:10:34,355 --> 00:10:37,108
<i>So you can sample it
because they only give you</i>

201
00:10:37,191 --> 00:10:39,110
<i>a 15 minute smoke break here.</i>

202
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:43,614
<i>Let's bring out
our world-class trainers here,</i>

203
00:10:43,948 --> 00:10:45,449
<i>Jesse and Paula.</i>

204
00:10:47,034 --> 00:10:49,412
<i>Thank you. Thank you, Ron.</i>

205
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:51,765
<i>I'd like to train you two lil' honeys
how to give me</i>

206
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:53,207
<i>a world class spanking.</i>

207
00:10:56,252 --> 00:10:58,754
<i>You know there's
no drinking on the job, Ron.</i>

208
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,256
<i>I'm aware of that, Missy.</i>

209
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:02,883
<i>There's also another rule
here at Sea World,</i>

210
00:11:03,134 --> 00:11:05,094
<i>no being a bitch on the job.</i>

211
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,976
<i>Okay-</i>

212
00:11:12,143 --> 00:11:15,354
<i>So, let's say hello
to the stars of the show,</i>

213
00:11:15,438 --> 00:11:17,356
<i>Chippy and Roo-roo!</i>

214
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,067
<i>The rat of the ocean, the dolphin.</i>

215
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:24,405
<i>Look, they're swimming
and doing tricks!</i>

216
00:11:24,572 --> 00:11:26,824
<i>Folks, what do you expect?
They're dolphins.</i>

217
00:11:28,326 --> 00:11:29,618
<i>What did you say?</i>

218
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:31,579
<i>Oh, really? You're a big man.</i>

219
00:11:33,164 --> 00:11:35,583
<i>You want to go?
I'll punch you in the face.</i>

220
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,918
He said he was going to
punch a dolphin.

221
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:40,629
You're a punk, Ron Burgundy!

222
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:43,341
<i>Hey, you want to see
the other dolphin show?</i>

223
00:11:43,424 --> 00:11:45,259
<i>It's right here in my pants.</i>

224
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:48,721
Children and animals hate you,
Ron Burgundy!

225
00:11:48,971 --> 00:11:50,681
<i>Go ahead, yell all you want!</i>

226
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,142
Unhand me, you buffoons!

227
00:11:54,894 --> 00:11:56,771
All right, first, you gave a gin and tonic

228
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:58,272
to the sea otters

229
00:11:58,356 --> 00:12:02,276
and then you stuck your dick
in the sea anemone display.

230
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:05,529
You're fired, you washed-up drunk!

231
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,947
Guess what, Trevor?

232
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:08,407
Every morning I get here early

233
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:11,660
and rub my private parts
with a sea cucumber.

234
00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:16,415
This is the end of the road.
I'm not turning back.

235
00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:20,920
I don't know if I'll vacate my bowels.

236
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,519
It's the only time I've ever hung myself.

237
00:12:25,883 --> 00:12:27,885
It's too late, Baxter.

238
00:12:29,678 --> 00:12:30,679
My final words?

239
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,392
Tell the people that I said...

240
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:40,356
"Firetruck. " I'm drawing a blank.

241
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,818
It's okay, you're a dog.

242
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:46,487
People won't expect you
to remember it word for word.

243
00:12:46,904 --> 00:12:49,615
Goodbye, my sweet hairy prince.

244
00:12:57,373 --> 00:13:00,042
Evonne Goolagong's feminine napkin!

245
00:13:00,334 --> 00:13:01,669
Mr. Burgundy?

246
00:13:01,752 --> 00:13:04,922
Hello, I... Oh, my God!

247
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:07,091
What the hell happened?

248
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:11,470
I tried to hang myself?

249
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,389
Because my life's a mess?

250
00:13:13,848 --> 00:13:15,599
And I saw no other option?

251
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:17,643
I think you're telling the truth,

252
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:19,854
but why are you saying it
like you're lying?

253
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,857
Because you're a stranger.

254
00:13:23,023 --> 00:13:25,651
And I don't want you to judge me.

255
00:13:26,277 --> 00:13:27,445
Yeah, but...

256
00:13:27,528 --> 00:13:29,655
it happened right before
you walked in. You missed it.

257
00:13:29,738 --> 00:13:32,741
Oh, well. 'Cause it happened. Yeah.

258
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:33,993
So...

259
00:13:34,785 --> 00:13:37,746
These are first-rate flapjacks.

260
00:13:38,372 --> 00:13:40,958
I'm telling you,
suicide makes you hungry,

261
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:42,793
I don't care what anyone says.

262
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:44,336
My name is Freddie Shapp,

263
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,590
and I'm a producer
of a new kind of news.

264
00:13:48,048 --> 00:13:50,384
We're starting a 24-hour news channel.

265
00:13:50,551 --> 00:13:51,886
First of its kind!

266
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:54,889
GNN. The Global News Network.

267
00:13:57,683 --> 00:13:59,351
That is, without a doubt,

268
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:01,353
the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

269
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:04,982
You mean news going 24 hours
around the clock?

270
00:14:05,107 --> 00:14:07,359
A channel that's never off,
in other words?

271
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:10,863
Yeah. Yeah. Just 24 hours.

272
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:16,118
Freddie Shapp, you are a fucking idiot.

273
00:14:16,285 --> 00:14:17,786
Mr. Burgundy, I assure you

274
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,830
we are 100% for real.

275
00:14:19,914 --> 00:14:22,500
We've got state-of-the-art
facilities in Manhattan.

276
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,211
And Kench Allenby, multi-millionaire

277
00:14:25,294 --> 00:14:27,546
and owner of Koala Airlines.

278
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:30,382
I saw Kench Allenby play
at the Bob Hope Classic.

279
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:32,968
He hit a wedge from 130 out,

280
00:14:33,093 --> 00:14:34,595
he put it on the head of a quarter.

281
00:14:34,803 --> 00:14:36,222
That guy Can Way-

282
00:14:36,472 --> 00:14:39,308
He's funding the whole network.
He believes in it.

283
00:14:39,808 --> 00:14:40,893
Here.

284
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:43,729
This is your first week's salary.

285
00:14:45,981 --> 00:14:48,567
By the oversized nipples of Della Reese!

286
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:51,946
We've got a whole news team
ready for you.

287
00:14:52,363 --> 00:14:57,618
Sports, weather and
a top-notch investigative reporter.

288
00:14:58,369 --> 00:15:01,247
This is a young guy
I never heard of. Bob Costas.

289
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:04,542
This guy, we'll get
his gap fixed, Letterman.

290
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:09,047
And Jennings. He's a young kid,
but they're hungry.

291
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,674
I don't think you understand, Freddie.

292
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,260
When my wife turned her back on me

293
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:18,223
by letting me turn my back on her
for fulfilling her dreams,

294
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:21,309
I knew the news game was over for me.

295
00:15:21,476 --> 00:15:24,646
No. You were put on this Earth
by God Almighty

296
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:26,314
to be a news man.

297
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:30,527
How dare you think about
depriving the people of that?

298
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:34,239
The Ron Burgundy I used to
love to watch on TV,

299
00:15:34,322 --> 00:15:35,824
he wouldn't take this lying down.

300
00:15:36,157 --> 00:15:37,993
What do you say, Ron?

301
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:42,747
I'll take the job.

302
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:46,293
And I swear to you
I'll be number one again.

303
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:49,212
I'll get my son back,
I'll restore my reputation

304
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:51,256
and make things right with Veronica.

305
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,341
But more importantly,

306
00:15:53,592 --> 00:15:56,845
I'll do what God put me
on this Earth to do.

307
00:15:57,804 --> 00:15:59,389
Be famous.

308
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,393
Ron... You've made my day.

309
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,689
I won't be using these jerk offs, though.

310
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:10,734
I've got the best damn
news team in the world.

311
00:16:11,026 --> 00:16:13,695
- Your call.
- I just have to find them.

312
00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:25,999
San Diago. Looks like we begin
our search right here at home.

313
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:28,126
Last I heard, Champ Kind was fired

314
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:30,920
for being drunk on the air
and saying that Asians

315
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:33,044
can't play baseball 'cause
they're always squinting.

316
00:16:36,301 --> 00:16:38,470
- Who loves chicken? You do!
- We do!

317
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,847
<i>Delicious chicken swing on through</i>

318
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,224
Meet the crew, hoo-hoo!

319
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:45,727
I'm local San Diego legend Champ Kind,

320
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,437
and I believe in two things:

321
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:49,773
Good chicken, and that
if Jesus had a sidearm

322
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:51,483
he wouldn't have been crucified.

323
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:53,610
So swing on by and grab a wing.

324
00:16:53,777 --> 00:16:56,863
<i>'Cause when you do,
you'll say, "Whammy!"</i>

325
00:16:57,197 --> 00:16:59,032
<i>BYOL. Bring your own liquor.</i>

326
00:16:59,157 --> 00:17:00,408
All right, there you go.

327
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:02,911
One Whammy Special,
with Whammy Slaw.

328
00:17:03,411 --> 00:17:06,081
There's a used Band-Aid
in my coleslaw.

329
00:17:06,331 --> 00:17:08,249
My gosh, let me take care of that.

330
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,459
Get out of here before

331
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:11,628
I smash your head in,
you Commie bastard!

332
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:14,255
If you're from the census,
you take me off your list!

333
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,385
You never did have much
of a bedside manner, Champ.

334
00:17:18,468 --> 00:17:20,303
Ron? Ron Burgundy?

335
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,555
- Get over here!
- How are you, friend?

336
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:24,891
God, I have longed for you.

337
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,019
- It's good to see you, too.
- Oh, this feels like home.

338
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:31,856
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Better now.

339
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:34,776
Okay, let's break the huddle here, huh?

340
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,112
Okay. All right.

341
00:17:37,362 --> 00:17:39,114
You get back here!

342
00:17:39,197 --> 00:17:40,281
Don't be weird!

343
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:42,992
So, Harken sits me down
to have a man to man.

344
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:45,161
I really don't remember much of it.

345
00:17:45,245 --> 00:17:48,039
I was told later, I guess
I took a swing at him.

346
00:17:48,123 --> 00:17:51,418
I had a knife in my pocket,
he got stabbed pretty deep.

347
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:52,752
I set a fire somewhere.

348
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:54,921
There was something dripping on me,

349
00:17:55,004 --> 00:17:56,506
now I got this nasty head wound.

350
00:17:56,798 --> 00:17:58,800
Turned out, I guess, I got in
a fight with some of the crew.

351
00:17:58,883 --> 00:17:59,884
Okay.

352
00:17:59,968 --> 00:18:02,053
Anyway, I was pretty insistent
I got on the air,

353
00:18:02,137 --> 00:18:04,180
but as you can understand,
Ed had to let me go.

354
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:06,599
His hands were tied in that situation.

355
00:18:06,891 --> 00:18:09,060
Fortunately, on the way out the door,

356
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:10,770
I fake a work injury.

357
00:18:10,854 --> 00:18:12,814
With the settlement, I bought this place.

358
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:15,019
Well, I'm glad to see you
landed on your feet, Champ.

359
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,736
Listen, can I ask you a question?

360
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:19,320
Sure. Anything.

361
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:21,322
Is... Is this chicken?

362
00:18:21,698 --> 00:18:23,450
Oh, hell, no.

363
00:18:23,616 --> 00:18:25,368
It's really impossible to turn a profit

364
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:26,911
if you serve real chicken.

365
00:18:27,078 --> 00:18:29,706
- Yeah. We use mainly bats.
- What?

366
00:18:30,206 --> 00:18:32,250
Yeah. But the good quality kind.

367
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:34,794
That's the most horrible thing
I've ever heard.

368
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,464
Yeah? You got to do
what you got to do, right?

369
00:18:37,672 --> 00:18:39,716
So what you got to do
is serve fried bats?

370
00:18:39,924 --> 00:18:40,925
Yep.

371
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:43,845
Can I ask you, is there
a recipe for the seasoning?

372
00:18:44,846 --> 00:18:47,849
The seasoning's the great secret,
we use road salt

373
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,185
and ashes from a crematorium.

374
00:18:50,518 --> 00:18:52,270
- Champ.
- It's crazy good.

375
00:18:52,353 --> 00:18:53,354
It's crazy wrong.

376
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,814
If you don't like that,
you don't even want to know

377
00:18:54,939 --> 00:18:56,608
what the French fries are made out of.

378
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:57,859
You're sure as hell right.

379
00:18:58,151 --> 00:18:59,992
- I'm going to tell you anyway.
- Please don't.

380
00:19:00,111 --> 00:19:03,698
Worms, grubs and camel feces
as a binding agent.

381
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:05,241
This is a horror show.

382
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:07,827
Why don't you have a bite
and stop judging it.

383
00:19:08,036 --> 00:19:09,954
I'm not going to bite into a fried bat.

384
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:12,207
- It's delicious.
- It's all tendon. Look at it.

385
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:16,753
Was that a bat?

386
00:19:17,086 --> 00:19:19,005
One gets loose about once a week.

387
00:19:19,088 --> 00:19:20,882
Hey, what brings you here, Ron?

388
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:24,677
My friend, we've got a job.
In New York City.

389
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:25,970
Whammy!

390
00:19:26,137 --> 00:19:28,306
That's the best news
I've heard since I found out

391
00:19:28,389 --> 00:19:29,974
you can get high off insect repellent.

392
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,660
You've got yourself a sportscaster.

393
00:19:31,684 --> 00:19:32,727
Oh, great.

394
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:34,020
Denny!

395
00:19:35,563 --> 00:19:36,898
Lock up!

396
00:19:37,232 --> 00:19:38,733
Any idea where Brian Fantana is?

397
00:19:38,817 --> 00:19:39,901
You haven't heard?

398
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:42,070
Fantana hit the big time.

399
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:46,115
Oh, yeah, you're a dirty
little thing, aren't you?

400
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,117
Yeah, that's it. Just play around.

401
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:49,601
Roll around like you're on the bed.

402
00:19:49,786 --> 00:19:52,831
Hey, I'm not here.
No one's here. You're alone.

403
00:19:53,248 --> 00:19:54,791
Do what you do when you're alone.

404
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,252
What's going on? What is this?

405
00:19:57,335 --> 00:19:59,712
What are these balls in my face?
That's it.

406
00:20:00,213 --> 00:20:02,298
What are these giant balls in my face?

407
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:04,634
Yeah, play with them.
Swat them around.

408
00:20:04,717 --> 00:20:06,477
That's it. I'm not here.
None of us are here.

409
00:20:07,512 --> 00:20:10,181
Do your thing. That's it.

410
00:20:11,432 --> 00:20:13,434
You're not getting any better than that.

411
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:16,479
- That's brilliant!
- Yeah, yeah.

412
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:18,898
Hey, Brian, you have any time
for the little people?

413
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,118
- Hey, Brian.
- Champ! How you doing?

414
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:31,327
Hey!

415
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:33,246
- Wow. This is a...
- Cool it!

416
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:35,498
No, but what I have found is that,
you know, you give a oat

417
00:20:35,623 --> 00:20:37,375
a lot of Amaretto, strangely enough,

418
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,127
and they'll sit still for quite a while.

419
00:20:39,335 --> 00:20:41,055
Oh, hey, look at this one,
this one's great.

420
00:20:41,462 --> 00:20:44,048
The experience of shooting
that one was transcendent.

421
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:45,717
So much so that I can confidently

422
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,510
look into the eyes
of any woman and say,

423
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:50,513
"You know what, I know
what childbirth is like. "

424
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:53,057
And I bet you a woman
would like to hear that.

425
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:56,519
Look at that little guy in the fish bowl.

426
00:20:56,811 --> 00:21:00,064
I gotta say, it's really great
and, of course,

427
00:21:00,148 --> 00:21:02,233
it's just so funny.

428
00:21:02,817 --> 00:21:04,402
Yeah. Sad ending to this one though.

429
00:21:04,694 --> 00:21:06,279
Poor little guy snapped his neck

430
00:21:06,362 --> 00:21:08,364
when I was trying to get him
out of the fish bowl.

431
00:21:08,448 --> 00:21:10,909
Stupid. I used tongs. Salad tongs.

432
00:21:10,992 --> 00:21:12,785
I don't know why
I didn't just use my hand.

433
00:21:12,869 --> 00:21:15,538
Seems like you could've just
tipped the jar on its side

434
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:17,749
and let him crawl out on his own leisure.

435
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,834
Yeah, hindsight is 20/20.

436
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:21,127
You know they call cats

437
00:21:21,252 --> 00:21:22,837
chicken of the freeway underpass.

438
00:21:23,504 --> 00:21:25,256
- What?
- Don't indulge him.

439
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,841
I never heard that.

440
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:28,426
Not a lot of bones in cats.

441
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:31,179
You could probably just get right at it.

442
00:21:32,263 --> 00:21:33,765
You need to stop, my friend.

443
00:21:34,182 --> 00:21:36,017
We don't eat cats
around these parts, Champ.

444
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:38,478
That's a blast.

445
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,105
<i>And this one's coming out today.
Cat Fancy magazine.</i>

446
00:21:41,242 --> 00:21:43,083
But not just the magazine.
In church rec rooms,

447
00:21:43,107 --> 00:21:44,442
school binders, everywhere.

448
00:21:44,525 --> 00:21:46,086
It's the biggest launch we've ever had.

449
00:21:47,028 --> 00:21:48,696
So why are you guys here, anyway?

450
00:21:48,947 --> 00:21:50,031
Well, Brian,

451
00:21:50,323 --> 00:21:52,700
we're getting the news team
back together again.

452
00:21:53,034 --> 00:21:54,035
Really?

453
00:21:54,118 --> 00:21:56,287
And, of course, we want
to know if you'll join us.

454
00:21:56,537 --> 00:21:57,789
Jeez, I don't know.

455
00:21:57,872 --> 00:22:00,375
I kind of got the world
by the tail here. I...

456
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,043
I don't know if I can.

457
00:22:02,293 --> 00:22:03,294
I get it. Christ.

458
00:22:03,378 --> 00:22:05,219
You're the Akira Kurosawa
of cat photographers.

459
00:22:05,338 --> 00:22:06,631
Why would you leave all this?

460
00:22:06,714 --> 00:22:09,467
Brian! Brian!

461
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:11,636
The cover's out!

462
00:22:12,261 --> 00:22:13,888
Oh, okay.

463
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,102
This is not good.

464
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,562
It's a typo.

465
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:27,169
I have to point out that
technically speaking

466
00:22:27,193 --> 00:22:28,194
a pussy is a cat.

467
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,320
- I know.
- That's true.

468
00:22:29,404 --> 00:22:31,739
But I never spend $100
on a lobster dinner

469
00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:32,907
for a kitty cat.

470
00:22:37,578 --> 00:22:39,747
Oh, no! We're all going to die!

471
00:22:40,081 --> 00:22:41,541
Thanks, Champ.

472
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:47,088
I'm not used to driving
these multi-axle vehicles.

473
00:22:48,673 --> 00:22:50,591
The question still remains...

474
00:22:51,342 --> 00:22:52,677
Where's Brick Tamland?

475
00:22:52,927 --> 00:22:55,263
You guys didn't hear?

476
00:22:55,513 --> 00:22:56,848
No, what happened?

477
00:22:57,515 --> 00:22:59,058
Brick's...

478
00:22:59,934 --> 00:23:01,185
Dead.

479
00:23:10,111 --> 00:23:12,363
Brick was lost at sea about a year ago.

480
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,199
Thought he saw a bird
and he swam out to pet it.

481
00:23:15,283 --> 00:23:16,617
He never came back.

482
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:19,120
We all loved Brick.

483
00:23:19,454 --> 00:23:20,455
Sweet Brick.

484
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:23,458
One time he introduced me
to his parents

485
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,793
who were clearly younger than him.

486
00:23:26,044 --> 00:23:27,462
Skip and Donna Tamland.

487
00:23:27,846 --> 00:23:29,606
- They were teenagers.
- And they were Asian.

488
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,715
Yes, they were.

489
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:33,593
He'll long be remembered and
he'll be sorely missed.

490
00:23:39,223 --> 00:23:40,725
Thank you, Reverend.

491
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:44,062
Oh, come on!

492
00:23:44,145 --> 00:23:46,230
Really?

493
00:23:46,314 --> 00:23:49,317
Brick loved to put his feet into pita bread

494
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:53,404
because they're like socks
except you can eat them.

495
00:23:53,905 --> 00:23:54,906
What?

496
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:59,118
It is hard for me to believe
that he is gone.

497
00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:04,290
I feel that I just saw him yesterday.

498
00:24:04,499 --> 00:24:06,501
You were probably talking
to yourself in a mirror.

499
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:08,836
Why? Why?

500
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,005
Why did you take him from us?

501
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:13,424
You're clearly standing
in front of us, Brick.

502
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:15,009
Brick is dead!

503
00:24:15,093 --> 00:24:16,761
- No, Brick's alive.
- Brick is dead!

504
00:24:16,844 --> 00:24:18,044
- Look at him!
- He's not dead.

505
00:24:18,137 --> 00:24:19,180
He's not dead, Brick. You're not dead.

506
00:24:19,305 --> 00:24:20,640
- You're Brick!
- Brick, it's you!

507
00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:22,183
He's dead!

508
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:25,478
No! You are Brick! Touch yourself.

509
00:24:25,686 --> 00:24:28,106
- I am Brick?
- Yes!

510
00:24:28,189 --> 00:24:30,191
- I'm alive?
- Yes!

511
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:32,026
Of course.

512
00:24:32,235 --> 00:24:33,569
Of course you are.

513
00:24:34,612 --> 00:24:37,448
You kind of want to slug him.
You want to slug him.

514
00:24:37,949 --> 00:24:40,243
I went to pet the bird but it was fast.

515
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:41,869
So I kept swimming.

516
00:24:42,245 --> 00:24:45,373
After a week I landed in
an island called Aloha.

517
00:24:45,706 --> 00:24:47,583
Moses on a Vespa.

518
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:49,877
He swam all the way to Hawaii.

519
00:24:50,128 --> 00:24:51,129
I married a lady

520
00:24:51,587 --> 00:24:53,464
and people paid me to catch bad guys

521
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:54,924
who didn't go to court.

522
00:24:55,216 --> 00:24:57,760
You were a bounty hunter in Hawaii
for the past year?

523
00:24:58,219 --> 00:25:01,389
Yes. I was a bangy hunger
in Y past gear...

524
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:02,974
You've got a Hawaiian wife?

525
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:05,434
Yes, her name's Lanai.
We have six kids.

526
00:25:05,893 --> 00:25:07,333
Six kids, you were only gone a year?

527
00:25:08,646 --> 00:25:10,189
I'm a bangy hunger.

528
00:25:10,898 --> 00:25:14,485
You can be a diaper salesman
in Duluth for all I care.

529
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:17,089
It's just great to get the news team
back together again.

530
00:25:17,113 --> 00:25:18,114
Hot damn.

531
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:24,912
Do you remember
our Easter trip to San Francisco?

532
00:25:25,288 --> 00:25:27,748
And we took that helicopter tour

533
00:25:27,915 --> 00:25:30,168
and Brick said, "I wish I could fly. "

534
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:32,962
And we said,
"Why don't you try?" Boom.

535
00:25:33,254 --> 00:25:34,881
I couldn't fly!

536
00:25:34,964 --> 00:25:37,925
He was flapping his arms
the whole way down.

537
00:25:38,342 --> 00:25:40,344
I ruptured my pancreas.

538
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,765
Remember the time I took
Champ's mom to the hospital

539
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:47,435
and then we hit it off
and I gave her gonorrhea?

540
00:25:48,686 --> 00:25:50,104
Champ's mom got the clap.

541
00:25:50,188 --> 00:25:52,523
- Oh, my God.
- She was pissed.

542
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:54,275
Fantana's a dirty dog.

543
00:25:54,442 --> 00:25:55,902
I'll tell you something, she was 78

544
00:25:55,985 --> 00:25:57,612
but she didn't look a day over 74.

545
00:25:57,695 --> 00:26:00,239
Get rid of the walker and the eye patch,

546
00:26:00,323 --> 00:26:01,824
I'll tell you, she ain't bad looking.

547
00:26:01,949 --> 00:26:02,992
Good to go.

548
00:26:03,117 --> 00:26:05,494
Best part of it all,
she actually fell in love with Brian.

549
00:26:05,995 --> 00:26:07,997
- How is she doing?
- She died yesterday.

550
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:10,708
Oh, that stinks. Tell her I said "hi. "

551
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:12,460
Well, I can't because she's dead now.

552
00:26:13,002 --> 00:26:14,420
- Oh, "dead" dead.
- Dead.

553
00:26:14,503 --> 00:26:15,796
She passed away.

554
00:26:16,214 --> 00:26:17,215
Gonorrhea?

555
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:21,302
You don't die from gonorrhea.

556
00:26:21,469 --> 00:26:22,803
You suffer quite a bit.

557
00:26:22,887 --> 00:26:24,472
Here's the real kicker,

558
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:25,973
and you guys are going to lose it.

559
00:26:26,057 --> 00:26:27,537
Do you know what her last words were?

560
00:26:27,975 --> 00:26:29,644
"Tell Brian I always loved him. "

561
00:26:38,653 --> 00:26:40,488
Well, tell her I said hi.

562
00:26:40,655 --> 00:26:42,198
No, I can't. She's not alive.

563
00:26:42,323 --> 00:26:43,532
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

564
00:26:43,824 --> 00:26:46,744
How about the time when I was born

565
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:49,497
and I came out of the vagina?

566
00:26:50,873 --> 00:26:52,250
And I was screaming,

567
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:56,003
"Here I come. Here I come, Mom. "

568
00:26:57,922 --> 00:27:00,174
How could we, Brick, we weren't there.

569
00:27:00,341 --> 00:27:01,926
We're telling stories involving

570
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:03,844
the entire news team from the past.

571
00:27:04,053 --> 00:27:07,431
Oh, what about the time
when we were in the Binewago

572
00:27:07,515 --> 00:27:10,851
and Ron told me that
I wasn't telling the story right?

573
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,841
There you go. That's pretty good.

574
00:27:13,854 --> 00:27:15,898
- That was about all of us.
- Not really.

575
00:27:16,107 --> 00:27:19,735
Man, this just feels right!
The news team is back!

576
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,028
Ron,

577
00:27:21,237 --> 00:27:24,031
Brian, Brick, me, even Baxter!

578
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,159
He's naked.

579
00:27:28,327 --> 00:27:29,495
Hey, Ron, who's driving?

580
00:27:29,578 --> 00:27:31,497
Oh, it's okay, it's on cruise control.

581
00:27:33,874 --> 00:27:36,043
Who wants some chimichangas, huh?

582
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,045
Best thing I ever did was install

583
00:27:38,129 --> 00:27:39,588
this deep fryer in the 'bago.

584
00:27:39,714 --> 00:27:41,716
Hey, Ron. Cruise control
just regulates speed,

585
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,217
it doesn't steer.

586
00:27:43,718 --> 00:27:44,802
Come again?

587
00:28:12,413 --> 00:28:14,915
Is that a pool of blood or urine I'm in?

588
00:28:27,136 --> 00:28:28,763
These are the guys you hired?

589
00:28:29,472 --> 00:28:32,058
Hey, Freddie! Pardon the appearance.

590
00:28:32,183 --> 00:28:35,686
Quick tip: never put
a deep fryer in your Winnebago.

591
00:28:37,521 --> 00:28:40,483
No, no, Brick. No. There we go.

592
00:28:41,692 --> 00:28:44,695
Here we are. Welcome to GNN.

593
00:28:47,865 --> 00:28:50,201
I don't know, Ron.
You sure about this place?

594
00:28:50,534 --> 00:28:52,703
Guys, I know it's a bit
of a mess, but trust me,

595
00:28:52,953 --> 00:28:55,790
everything will be ready
for the launch tomorrow.

596
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,710
We've culled the whole country
for the best newsmen.

597
00:29:00,044 --> 00:29:01,962
There's Curtis Knightfish from Houston.

598
00:29:02,046 --> 00:29:03,089
Oh, Curtis Knightfish.

599
00:29:03,172 --> 00:29:04,612
They don't get any better than that.

600
00:29:04,882 --> 00:29:07,009
One night Knightfish and I got so drunk

601
00:29:07,134 --> 00:29:10,137
we drank the fluid
from six Magic 8 Balls.

602
00:29:10,805 --> 00:29:12,181
Never got the answer.

603
00:29:12,723 --> 00:29:13,891
You had to go to the hospital
for that, right?

604
00:29:14,016 --> 00:29:15,351
Oh, yeah, I lost a kidney.

605
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:18,229
There's Diane Yahwea
from Carson City.

606
00:29:18,312 --> 00:29:21,357
You know what they call her?
"All the Way Yahwea. "

607
00:29:21,732 --> 00:29:24,151
Yeah! She won a Pulitzer.

608
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:28,823
And the best in the biz.
Jack Lime, out of Chicago.

609
00:29:29,156 --> 00:29:32,993
Rumor is Allenby is giving him
one mil a year.

610
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:35,329
That's crazy. Who's worth
that kind of money?

611
00:29:36,956 --> 00:29:40,209
Oh, my God!
He's absolutely magnificent!

612
00:29:40,543 --> 00:29:43,045
I betcha that brother bags a lot of p.

613
00:29:44,338 --> 00:29:47,007
- I'd like to pee on him.
- Yeah.

614
00:29:47,675 --> 00:29:48,676
Wait. What?

615
00:29:50,177 --> 00:29:52,430
I bet the inside of his mouth
is even beautiful.

616
00:29:53,097 --> 00:29:54,598
Can I help you, guy?

617
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:56,016
What was that?

618
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,476
I said, "Can I help you, guy?"

619
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,854
What do you mean?

620
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,022
Well, you're staring at me, hotshot.

621
00:30:02,606 --> 00:30:04,233
Do you want my autograph?

622
00:30:06,694 --> 00:30:08,404
No, he was just explaining

623
00:30:08,529 --> 00:30:10,364
who you were and I was looking at you.

624
00:30:10,531 --> 00:30:11,740
And then he said something

625
00:30:11,866 --> 00:30:13,617
and I was still looking at you.

626
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,543
Jack Lime is a great man!

627
00:30:24,295 --> 00:30:25,815
Is that what I sound like when I talk?

628
00:30:29,467 --> 00:30:30,718
I guess that's funny. I mean...

629
00:30:31,677 --> 00:30:34,597
- That is you.
- I sometimes sound like that, I guess.

630
00:30:35,055 --> 00:30:36,056
Hey, Slugger!

631
00:30:36,557 --> 00:30:38,476
What's feeding time
for that mustache of yours?

632
00:30:43,147 --> 00:30:46,650
Brick, what are you doing
laughing over there?

633
00:30:47,234 --> 00:30:49,570
- Get back over here.
- Get over here.

634
00:30:49,653 --> 00:30:50,988
Come on, Brick.

635
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,325
So, anyways, that's Jack Lime.

636
00:30:55,409 --> 00:30:57,119
Come on, guys. Let's go meet the boss.

637
00:30:57,953 --> 00:30:59,622
We'll have separate cameras

638
00:30:59,747 --> 00:31:02,416
for you, and then sports
and then weather.

639
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:04,992
Let me ask you this, Freddie,
how's the new head honcho?

640
00:31:05,085 --> 00:31:08,756
Well, Linda Jackson
has a shelf full of Emmys.

641
00:31:08,923 --> 00:31:13,093
She's tough as nails.
And Linda loves to win.

642
00:31:13,177 --> 00:31:14,929
Oh, hey, Linda!

643
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:17,806
I want to introduce you to Ron Burgundy.

644
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:21,185
Linda Jackson. How are you, my friend?

645
00:31:21,435 --> 00:31:22,436
Ron.

646
00:31:23,187 --> 00:31:24,688
This is Linda Jackson.

647
00:31:25,523 --> 00:31:26,690
Hello, Mr. Burgundy.

648
00:31:29,235 --> 00:31:30,236
Black.

649
00:31:32,696 --> 00:31:34,156
Black.

650
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:35,658
Black.

651
00:31:36,992 --> 00:31:38,113
You're choking on something.

652
00:31:39,245 --> 00:31:40,371
I'm terribly sorry.

653
00:31:40,454 --> 00:31:42,581
I don't know why I can't stop saying...

654
00:31:43,374 --> 00:31:45,042
Black. The word "black. "

655
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:46,627
Hello, Mr. Burgundy.

656
00:31:46,961 --> 00:31:48,587
- Black.
- Black.

657
00:31:49,296 --> 00:31:51,340
- Black.
- Black.

658
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:53,634
Stop saying "black. "

659
00:31:53,842 --> 00:31:56,220
If I keep my mouth open,
I just won't say it.

660
00:31:57,054 --> 00:31:59,348
Donna, can you please
get me a cup of coffee?

661
00:31:59,682 --> 00:32:01,517
- Right away, Ms. Jackson.
- Thank you.

662
00:32:01,976 --> 00:32:04,478
Hey, Donna. Make the coffee black.

663
00:32:04,853 --> 00:32:07,147
- Please be seated. Everyone.
- Sure.

664
00:32:07,314 --> 00:32:08,524
Please be seated.

665
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,490
Can you take a seat on the sofa?

666
00:32:16,824 --> 00:32:18,826
Come on, guys, it's not preschool.

667
00:32:19,827 --> 00:32:20,828
Sit on the furniture.

668
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:22,631
They were trying to be
deferential, I think.

669
00:32:23,414 --> 00:32:27,334
Great. So I know
that all of you are aware

670
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,110
that the news community is laughing

671
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:31,088
at what we're trying to do
here at 24-hour news.

672
00:32:31,171 --> 00:32:32,881
But that is why they brought me in.

673
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,100
Listen, I feel like I
need to clear the air.

674
00:32:35,342 --> 00:32:36,552
Oh, please don't.

675
00:32:36,677 --> 00:32:38,637
I want you to know, on behalf
of the news team,

676
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:41,682
we are huge supporters of all

677
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:43,517
African and Americans.

678
00:32:44,351 --> 00:32:46,895
I like lions. But not to touch.

679
00:32:47,187 --> 00:32:50,232
I remember the first African
and American I ever saw.

680
00:32:50,524 --> 00:32:52,067
It's African-American.

681
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:53,861
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

682
00:32:54,069 --> 00:32:56,572
Absolutely 100% positive? It isn't like...

683
00:32:56,697 --> 00:32:57,740
Ron...

684
00:32:57,865 --> 00:33:00,618
- Fish and chips?
- African 'n' American?

685
00:33:01,035 --> 00:33:02,275
Like an "n" with an apostrophe?

686
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:04,538
Please just stop it.

687
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,291
Linda, guess what movie
I watch every Christmas?

688
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:09,376
<i>Little Darlings with Kristy McNichol?</i>

689
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,378
<i>Six Pack starring Kenny Rogers?</i>

690
00:33:11,545 --> 00:33:12,755
A modern classic.

691
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:14,381
Carrot.

692
00:33:15,382 --> 00:33:17,885
Carrot? I'm not familiar with that film.

693
00:33:18,052 --> 00:33:19,928
It's really, really good.

694
00:33:20,554 --> 00:33:23,849
I put on my comfy slippers and
pour myself a cup of nog

695
00:33:23,932 --> 00:33:25,726
<i>and watch The Wiz.</i>

696
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:29,897
<i>Judy Garland who? The Wiz
makes the real Wizard of Oz</i>

697
00:33:30,064 --> 00:33:31,482
its bitch.

698
00:33:31,774 --> 00:33:35,069
Hey, we're all the same color
on the inside. Pink.

699
00:33:35,736 --> 00:33:37,816
With a little bit of brown and
a little bit of white.

700
00:33:38,113 --> 00:33:39,114
Milky yellow.

701
00:33:39,281 --> 00:33:41,158
Look, I don't care what color you are,

702
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:44,578
black, green, yellow, brown...

703
00:33:44,828 --> 00:33:46,914
Just as long as you act white.

704
00:33:47,498 --> 00:33:50,250
Jesus, this is the worst meeting
I've ever been in.

705
00:33:50,626 --> 00:33:52,753
A black man follows me
everywhere when it's sunny.

706
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:54,797
Actually, I think that's
your shadow, Brick.

707
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,465
I call him Leon.

708
00:33:56,757 --> 00:33:58,550
He's about half as tall as I am

709
00:33:58,634 --> 00:34:00,094
depending on what time of day it is.

710
00:34:00,469 --> 00:34:02,096
He likes to play the timpani

711
00:34:02,638 --> 00:34:05,015
and he is a water-colorist.

712
00:34:05,113 --> 00:34:06,993
What happens to him
when it gets cloudy outside?

713
00:34:07,017 --> 00:34:08,268
Leon goes away.

714
00:34:08,477 --> 00:34:10,357
It's your shadow.
He's talking about his shadow.

715
00:34:10,604 --> 00:34:13,107
Shut your damn mouths! Sit down!

716
00:34:15,776 --> 00:34:16,777
What's he doing?

717
00:34:16,944 --> 00:34:19,446
I think you scared him.
You can't shout at Brick.

718
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,281
Is he all right?

719
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:24,118
Do you have a red umbrella or a kitten?

720
00:34:24,368 --> 00:34:25,369
No.

721
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:26,829
Something soft and squishy?

722
00:34:26,995 --> 00:34:27,996
No.

723
00:34:28,122 --> 00:34:29,802
Brick, get up,
we're going to watch Carrot.

724
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,041
Yeah, Brick,
do you want to watch Carrot?

725
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:32,126
Carrot's on?

726
00:34:32,626 --> 00:34:33,627
That's all it takes.

727
00:34:33,711 --> 00:34:36,380
- Is this for real, Freddie?
- Linda, I'm sorry.

728
00:34:36,505 --> 00:34:38,006
No, it's okay! It's okay.

729
00:34:38,132 --> 00:34:40,884
So you have a black boss,
and it's freaking you out.

730
00:34:40,968 --> 00:34:42,010
Is it freaking you out?

731
00:34:42,136 --> 00:34:43,429
Oh, my gosh, yes.

732
00:34:43,512 --> 00:34:44,638
Yes, we're feeling uncomfortable.

733
00:34:44,722 --> 00:34:45,889
This freaking you out?

734
00:34:46,014 --> 00:34:47,266
Just take my wallet.

735
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:48,851
I don't give a shit!

736
00:34:48,976 --> 00:34:51,311
We're not all here to hold hands
and sing Kumbaya.

737
00:34:52,146 --> 00:34:53,814
So as long as you guys get numbers,

738
00:34:53,897 --> 00:34:55,983
we are gonna get along just fine.

739
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:58,861
Now, if you don't, I am gonna be icy.

740
00:34:59,653 --> 00:35:00,988
And unpleasant, you dig?

741
00:35:01,238 --> 00:35:02,656
I dig.

742
00:35:02,823 --> 00:35:04,324
What does that mean?

743
00:35:04,658 --> 00:35:06,034
Could be a dance.

744
00:35:06,326 --> 00:35:09,329
We dig. We're no jive turkeys.

745
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,498
Yup, we dig it.

746
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,002
Well, if you gentlemen will
please excuse yourselves,

747
00:35:15,169 --> 00:35:17,337
I'm going to fry me some hush puppies

748
00:35:17,504 --> 00:35:19,089
and do me a little dance

749
00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:20,758
and go hang out with my boyfriend,

750
00:35:20,841 --> 00:35:23,510
the basketball player who
has a humongous donkey.

751
00:35:25,095 --> 00:35:28,015
We hope you two
have a wonderful time.

752
00:35:28,682 --> 00:35:30,184
That was a joke.

753
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,231
Of course it was!

754
00:35:37,065 --> 00:35:39,109
I knew it. I knew she was joking.

755
00:35:39,193 --> 00:35:40,194
Get out.

756
00:35:40,694 --> 00:35:42,446
What team do you think
the fella plays for?

757
00:35:42,613 --> 00:35:44,782
No, no, she was kidding.
She made it clear.

758
00:35:45,032 --> 00:35:47,075
That's why I made jokes about us.

759
00:35:47,576 --> 00:35:51,580
Guys. Guys, I got you an apartment

760
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,833
on the Upper East Side
and a whole new wardrobe.

761
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:57,753
That's wonderful! When
do we begin our broadcast?

762
00:35:58,212 --> 00:35:59,713
Well, the big launch is tomorrow

763
00:35:59,797 --> 00:36:01,256
- at 12:00 noon.
- Okay.

764
00:36:01,632 --> 00:36:05,219
You guys are slotted for
the 2:00 a. m. to 5:00 a. m. slot.

765
00:36:05,803 --> 00:36:09,056
What? That's the graveyard shift!

766
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:10,724
"I ain't afraid of no ghost. "

767
00:36:11,141 --> 00:36:12,421
This is a real shocker, Freddie.

768
00:36:12,643 --> 00:36:14,186
Hey, after that meeting,

769
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:16,104
you're lucky you weren't fired!

770
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,358
You wouldn't
stop saying the word black.

771
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,181
I'm of the right mind to march
right back in there and ask

772
00:36:22,194 --> 00:36:23,234
for a different time slot.

773
00:36:23,278 --> 00:36:24,655
- That's a good idea.
- Okay, okay.

774
00:36:24,738 --> 00:36:26,990
I'll let you go in
if you can just not say black.

775
00:36:29,952 --> 00:36:32,287
- Black. Nope.
- See.

776
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:34,540
- She did it too.
- She did what?

777
00:36:34,748 --> 00:36:35,749
A two-way street.

778
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:37,125
Yeah, double-edged sword here.

779
00:36:37,376 --> 00:36:39,086
It's a two-way double-edged sword.

780
00:36:39,169 --> 00:36:40,170
It's only one way.

781
00:36:40,254 --> 00:36:42,339
- That clears it up.
- Great.

782
00:36:43,006 --> 00:36:45,092
Let's get your keys. Come on!

783
00:36:47,678 --> 00:36:49,263
Is there booze in the apartment?

784
00:36:49,346 --> 00:36:50,667
Of course there's gonna be booze.

785
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,332
What are you doing, Chani? Answer it!

786
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:20,586
Hi. Yes, let me transfer you.

787
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,422
Your job is to answer the phones.

788
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:25,066
I'm getting ready for Secret Santa.

789
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,300
When is that again?

790
00:37:26,383 --> 00:37:29,636
It's at Christmastime.
When else would it be?

791
00:37:30,971 --> 00:37:32,514
Yeah.

792
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,600
Merry Christmas.

793
00:37:35,183 --> 00:37:36,184
Thanks.

794
00:37:37,492 --> 00:37:39,372
One time I threw a pool ball
as hard as I could,

795
00:37:39,396 --> 00:37:43,025
straight up into the air,
and then forgot I threw it.

796
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,694
I started to eat a tomato
from my back pocket,

797
00:37:45,777 --> 00:37:47,817
then the pool ball came down
and hit me in the head.

798
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,615
It hurt so much I ran around screaming,

799
00:37:49,698 --> 00:37:51,450
"Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!"

800
00:37:52,284 --> 00:37:53,827
I love stories about France.

801
00:37:54,578 --> 00:37:56,705
I love stories where skeletons
play the piano.

802
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,710
I'm Brick. I was dead last week.

803
00:38:01,793 --> 00:38:03,128
I'm Chani.

804
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,423
I like the parts of your face

805
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,843
that are covered with skin.

806
00:38:10,218 --> 00:38:12,554
Your hair looks like
wet popcorn in a fishing net.

807
00:38:13,597 --> 00:38:17,142
I just get out of the shower
and burn it a little.

808
00:38:18,226 --> 00:38:19,478
Can you do this?

809
00:38:26,526 --> 00:38:27,527
That's good.

810
00:38:39,206 --> 00:38:40,832
- I liked this.
- Me too.

811
00:38:41,249 --> 00:38:42,584
- What we did.
- Yeah?

812
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:44,544
- You.
- And you.

813
00:38:48,757 --> 00:38:49,883
You're very pretty.

814
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:52,260
Come on, Brick.

815
00:38:54,784 --> 00:38:56,824
Damn it, Chani! I'm not
picking up that phone again.

816
00:38:56,848 --> 00:38:57,849
You pick it up!

817
00:38:58,684 --> 00:39:01,103
- You pick it up, Chani!
- No.

818
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:06,108
Chani, not today. No, not today, Chani.

819
00:39:06,441 --> 00:39:09,569
- It's been a tough day.
- ... really crazy day.

820
00:39:09,778 --> 00:39:10,821
For everybody.

821
00:39:12,072 --> 00:39:14,408
- I think I'm pregnant.
- No. You're not pregnant.

822
00:39:14,491 --> 00:39:16,994
You said it a number of times.
I don't think it's true.

823
00:39:20,956 --> 00:39:22,582
- My water broke.
- No, it didn't.

824
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:25,961
You spilled water
from that glass on the ground.

825
00:39:29,172 --> 00:39:30,298
Chani.

826
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:36,096
Okay, from here on out, starting now,

827
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:38,598
when the phone rings, you pick
up the phone. You say hello.

828
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:40,684
Hello. I'm going to transfer you.

829
00:39:40,976 --> 00:39:43,937
It didn't ring that time,
Chani. Nobody was there.

830
00:39:44,813 --> 00:39:46,356
Nobody was there.

831
00:40:23,185 --> 00:40:25,353
Surprise! Big Daddy's back.

832
00:40:25,562 --> 00:40:26,730
Ron.

833
00:40:28,148 --> 00:40:29,566
What are you doing here?

834
00:40:29,816 --> 00:40:32,486
I'm over at GNN.
I'm living in the city again.

835
00:40:32,903 --> 00:40:35,072
I really wish that
you would have called first.

836
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:37,866
Look, it doesn't matter whose
fault the break-up was, okay?

837
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:39,493
I was stubborn.

838
00:40:39,576 --> 00:40:41,661
You were all slutty with Mack Tannen

839
00:40:41,745 --> 00:40:43,747
slinging your ass around in that office.

840
00:40:44,122 --> 00:40:46,750
I played it with calm, cool integrity.

841
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:49,544
But who cares?
We're not keeping score.

842
00:40:49,628 --> 00:40:50,962
What's your point, Ron?

843
00:40:51,379 --> 00:40:53,048
The point is...

844
00:40:53,465 --> 00:40:55,550
I'm back home.

845
00:40:55,884 --> 00:40:57,803
And I want to spend the rest of my life...

846
00:40:57,886 --> 00:40:59,096
Honey, who is it?

847
00:41:05,393 --> 00:41:08,063
Hi, Ron. I'm Gary, Veronica's lover.

848
00:41:09,523 --> 00:41:11,858
It's okay. It's the '80s.

849
00:41:12,025 --> 00:41:14,111
She's your ex. She's my lover.

850
00:41:14,361 --> 00:41:15,904
Let's go inside.

851
00:41:16,321 --> 00:41:17,656
Why are you smiling so much?

852
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:20,951
Because I'm happy.
Because we're lovers.

853
00:41:21,368 --> 00:41:22,661
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

854
00:41:22,953 --> 00:41:23,954
No one's that happy.

855
00:41:24,187 --> 00:41:26,307
- Would you like to come in?
- Do you want to come in?

856
00:41:26,331 --> 00:41:29,376
Great. And I have no problem
with your situation.

857
00:41:39,553 --> 00:41:42,556
So, is that a gift for me, Ron?

858
00:41:42,806 --> 00:41:44,808
No, it's not.

859
00:41:45,976 --> 00:41:46,977
It's for Walter.

860
00:41:47,227 --> 00:41:48,311
Okay.

861
00:41:48,395 --> 00:41:50,397
So when were you going
to tell me about Gary?

862
00:41:50,647 --> 00:41:55,485
Ron. You walked out on me.
What did you expect me to do?

863
00:41:55,952 --> 00:41:57,672
Just sit here and
wait for you to come back?

864
00:41:57,696 --> 00:41:59,322
Here's a news flash.
You would have been waiting for

865
00:41:59,406 --> 00:42:01,046
the rest of your life
because we are done.

866
00:42:01,366 --> 00:42:02,826
All right. Good.

867
00:42:02,909 --> 00:42:05,579
In fact, I've a got a new lover.

868
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:07,205
Oh, what's her name?

869
00:42:07,664 --> 00:42:10,500
My lady?

870
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:14,754
Her name is...
Her name's Rick Volcano.

871
00:42:15,547 --> 00:42:19,718
Really? Her name's Rick Volcano?

872
00:42:20,427 --> 00:42:22,262
Yes, she's from Easter Island!

873
00:42:22,387 --> 00:42:23,430
Okay.

874
00:42:23,513 --> 00:42:26,558
Ron, this is awkward I know.

875
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:29,895
Sitting here with your wife.
We make love.

876
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:33,356
I'm this close to taking an ax handle
to that face of yours.

877
00:42:33,565 --> 00:42:34,733
Oh, Ron!

878
00:42:35,025 --> 00:42:36,776
So what does this Gary
do for a living, huh?

879
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:38,612
Have you done
a background check on him?

880
00:42:38,695 --> 00:42:41,573
Gary is actually one
of the most successful

881
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,551
psychologists in all of Manhattan, Ron.

882
00:42:43,575 --> 00:42:44,618
Really sweet.

883
00:42:45,118 --> 00:42:46,620
Are you reading my mind right now?

884
00:42:46,703 --> 00:42:49,539
Ron, do you even know
what a psychologist is?

885
00:42:49,789 --> 00:42:52,292
Yes. Yes, I do, Gary.

886
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:56,046
You perform in nightclubs
with a dummy on your lap.

887
00:42:56,213 --> 00:42:59,299
You make his mouth move.
You're so believable.

888
00:42:59,424 --> 00:43:01,218
Actually I have respect for your talent.

889
00:43:01,301 --> 00:43:02,469
I don't know how you do it

890
00:43:02,552 --> 00:43:03,970
because you're talking out
of the side of your mouth

891
00:43:04,095 --> 00:43:05,138
and yet it sounds like the dummy's...

892
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:06,423
You bring that dummy to life.

893
00:43:06,473 --> 00:43:08,767
Do you really think that a psychologist

894
00:43:09,142 --> 00:43:10,894
is a ventriloquist?

895
00:43:11,978 --> 00:43:13,313
Fuck you.

896
00:43:14,439 --> 00:43:15,440
Ron!

897
00:43:15,815 --> 00:43:16,983
- It's okay.
- You stop that!

898
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,485
He's externalizing. That's okay.

899
00:43:18,568 --> 00:43:20,403
- No, it's not okay.
- He's mad.

900
00:43:20,779 --> 00:43:22,340
You knew I was going
to throw that punch

901
00:43:22,447 --> 00:43:24,241
'cause you're reading my mind!

902
00:43:25,325 --> 00:43:27,244
Mom! I'm home!

903
00:43:27,452 --> 00:43:28,773
- Hey, little guy.
- Hey, darling.

904
00:43:28,995 --> 00:43:30,747
- Hi, Walter.
- Hey, Dad.

905
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:33,000
I missed you!

906
00:43:33,167 --> 00:43:35,503
Walter, your father has a gift for you.

907
00:43:35,795 --> 00:43:39,298
I have a gift specifically for you, Walter.

908
00:43:40,578 --> 00:43:41,818
There's a little card on there.

909
00:43:41,842 --> 00:43:42,843
Do you want to read it, kiddo?

910
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:46,180
Yes. Show us how well
you're doing in school.

911
00:43:48,182 --> 00:43:50,851
"To my dearest sex angel. "

912
00:43:51,018 --> 00:43:52,853
Okay, I actually believe that
that's for me.

913
00:43:52,979 --> 00:43:54,146
Hold on. Let the boy finish.

914
00:43:54,355 --> 00:43:55,856
- Ron.
- There's more.

915
00:43:55,982 --> 00:43:59,485
"I long once again to be
intertwined in your limbs.

916
00:44:00,152 --> 00:44:02,530
"Exchanging hot breath with you.

917
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:06,534
"I want to have another child with you. "

918
00:44:07,118 --> 00:44:10,329
Mom, I didn't know
little boys could have babies.

919
00:44:10,496 --> 00:44:14,542
No, darling. I believe that
letter was for someone else.

920
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:16,080
Go ahead, open up your gift.

921
00:44:16,877 --> 00:44:18,004
There you go.

922
00:44:18,212 --> 00:44:19,338
Yes, Gary.

923
00:44:24,552 --> 00:44:26,220
Okay, that's actually for me, Walter.

924
00:44:26,512 --> 00:44:30,182
No, it's not. It's for Walter.
It's a superhero costume.

925
00:44:30,516 --> 00:44:31,726
What is it?

926
00:44:31,892 --> 00:44:34,562
It's "Lace Man. "
It's a brand new superhero.

927
00:44:34,729 --> 00:44:36,897
I'm going to be Lace Man!

928
00:44:37,189 --> 00:44:38,899
Look, Ron. Joint custody isn't easy.

929
00:44:38,983 --> 00:44:40,359
But what we need to do is

930
00:44:40,526 --> 00:44:43,070
rally around this little guy
right now, okay?

931
00:44:43,404 --> 00:44:44,739
That's never gonna happen.

932
00:44:45,031 --> 00:44:46,032
Excuse me?

933
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,409
Because you, Veronica,
are unfit to be a mother!

934
00:44:48,701 --> 00:44:49,910
Need I remind you, Ron,

935
00:44:50,036 --> 00:44:53,164
that you tried to put
our six-year-old son on welfare?

936
00:44:53,247 --> 00:44:54,582
He's a perfect applicant!

937
00:44:54,915 --> 00:44:57,918
He's unemployed. If it wasn't
for us he'd be homeless.

938
00:44:58,419 --> 00:44:59,920
Do you ever hear yourself?

939
00:45:00,504 --> 00:45:02,504
All right, let's keep it civil
in front of the boy.

940
00:45:03,424 --> 00:45:06,010
It's bad enough his mother
pulled a train on KISS.

941
00:45:06,177 --> 00:45:09,055
- I was in college!
- Get your things! Let's go.

942
00:45:09,221 --> 00:45:10,221
Fine. I'm out of here.

943
00:45:10,264 --> 00:45:11,766
- Don't have to tell me twice.
- Get your things.

944
00:45:11,891 --> 00:45:14,352
- We'll see you guys later.
- Yes, you will.

945
00:45:14,435 --> 00:45:16,937
Goodbye, Dad! Thanks for the present.

946
00:45:17,188 --> 00:45:19,565
Goodbye, Walter. My little man.

947
00:45:20,399 --> 00:45:22,443
You promise to do good in school, okay.

948
00:45:22,693 --> 00:45:23,694
Okay.

949
00:45:23,778 --> 00:45:25,946
And stay away from the he-shes
down in the Bowery.

950
00:45:26,197 --> 00:45:28,032
Ron. I don't think that's appropriate.

951
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:30,785
I'll tell you, those fellas,
they got the looks,

952
00:45:30,868 --> 00:45:33,287
they got curves, they got the chi-chi's,

953
00:45:33,454 --> 00:45:34,705
they smell great,

954
00:45:34,872 --> 00:45:36,792
and then at some point
in the evening you realize

955
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:39,460
Jacqueline isn't Jacqueline,
she's a Jake.

956
00:45:39,585 --> 00:45:40,628
Okay.

957
00:45:40,711 --> 00:45:41,796
Then you got a decision.

958
00:45:41,879 --> 00:45:44,465
You're either going to be rude
or belly up to the bar

959
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:47,301
for a couple of more belts
and make the best of it.

960
00:45:47,426 --> 00:45:48,886
Do you hear what I'm saying, Walter?

961
00:45:49,053 --> 00:45:50,304
Yes, I do.

962
00:45:53,265 --> 00:45:55,476
Plug it in, Scotty, let it go.

963
00:45:55,893 --> 00:45:57,228
Ladies and gentlemen,

964
00:45:57,311 --> 00:46:00,439
we are officially connected to the world!

965
00:46:02,108 --> 00:46:03,234
Wow!

966
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,161
Look at all those other
countries and people...

967
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,826
Makes you feel small.

968
00:46:12,326 --> 00:46:14,495
Hundreds of thousands of people,

969
00:46:14,787 --> 00:46:16,622
all speaking jibber-jabber,

970
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,582
not understanding a word of each other,

971
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:21,127
yet somehow interconnected.

972
00:46:21,502 --> 00:46:23,504
It's a big world!

973
00:46:24,338 --> 00:46:28,175
<i>It's a big world</i>

974
00:46:29,385 --> 00:46:34,014
<i>Much, much bigger
than you'd ever think</i>

975
00:46:35,891 --> 00:46:40,312
<i>It's a big world</i>

976
00:46:41,063 --> 00:46:42,676
<i>Full of cities,</i>

977
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:48,059
<i>mountains and lots
of different stinks</i>

978
00:46:49,697 --> 00:46:50,977
<i>There's brown people
White people</i>

979
00:46:51,115 --> 00:46:52,116
<i>- Yellows
- Even reds!</i>

980
00:46:52,366 --> 00:46:54,535
<i>A thousand ways for
the word donut to be said</i>

981
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:57,538
<i>- There's tacos, sushi
- Chop suey, pita bread</i>

982
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:02,001
<i>Big world Big world</i>

983
00:47:02,376 --> 00:47:07,131
<i>Anyone who says it's small
should be kicked in the head!</i>

984
00:47:10,676 --> 00:47:12,052
<i>There's karate people!</i>

985
00:47:12,303 --> 00:47:13,304
<i>Big world!</i>

986
00:47:13,721 --> 00:47:14,805
<i>Scarfy headed ladies</i>

987
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:15,931
<i>Big world</i>

988
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,683
<i>Ladies having private time</i>

989
00:47:17,766 --> 00:47:18,767
<i>Big world</i>

990
00:47:18,893 --> 00:47:20,102
<i>A skinny guy!</i>

991
00:47:20,186 --> 00:47:21,729
<i>Big world</i>

992
00:47:22,646 --> 00:47:26,066
Wait a minute.
You're not black or Asian.

993
00:47:26,192 --> 00:47:27,526
What are you?

994
00:47:27,693 --> 00:47:28,819
I'm gay.

995
00:47:29,111 --> 00:47:30,613
Hey! You forgot to whisper.

996
00:47:30,905 --> 00:47:33,032
I'm not hiding it. I'm openly gay.

997
00:47:33,616 --> 00:47:37,786
"Openly gay"? I'm not familiar
with that term.

998
00:47:38,245 --> 00:47:39,830
I'm not ashamed of who I am and

999
00:47:40,164 --> 00:47:41,415
I decided to tell everyone.

1000
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:44,293
I'm having a hard time wrapping
my head around this one.

1001
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,128
Do you eat gay food?

1002
00:47:46,795 --> 00:47:48,631
What's the gayest food you can name?

1003
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:50,716
Kiwis.

1004
00:47:50,925 --> 00:47:54,136
- Do you sleep in a coffin?
- No, that's vampires.

1005
00:47:54,428 --> 00:47:56,430
Are you allowed to be out in the sun?

1006
00:47:56,597 --> 00:47:59,517
- Those are also vampires.
- Are you a vampire?

1007
00:47:59,642 --> 00:48:00,643
No, I'm gay.

1008
00:48:01,101 --> 00:48:04,605
If someone puts a pill in your
drink, can they turn you gay?

1009
00:48:05,064 --> 00:48:06,398
Maybe temporarily.

1010
00:48:06,565 --> 00:48:08,400
Where do you get those pills?

1011
00:48:08,776 --> 00:48:12,488
I wonder what it'd be like to
be gay... Just for a day?

1012
00:48:13,364 --> 00:48:15,866
<i>If I was gay for a day</i>

1013
00:48:16,283 --> 00:48:17,993
<i>There's nothing I wouldn't say</i>

1014
00:48:19,078 --> 00:48:20,913
<i>That's the gay way</i>

1015
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:25,793
<i>If I was gay for a day
I'd go all the way</i>

1016
00:48:26,252 --> 00:48:27,503
<i>With GUYS</i>

1017
00:48:29,421 --> 00:48:30,839
<i>That's the gay way</i>

1018
00:48:31,131 --> 00:48:35,386
<i>I'd wear a cowboy hat
A nice three-piece suit</i>

1019
00:48:35,761 --> 00:48:39,431
<i>I'd talk about sports
and have a nice drink</i>

1020
00:48:40,641 --> 00:48:43,143
Champ. That's kind of what you do now.

1021
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,605
<i>That's the gay way</i>

1022
00:48:46,814 --> 00:48:51,318
<i>If I was gay for a day
I'd get bitten by a spider</i>

1023
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:55,573
<i>And then I would have
the powers of that spider</i>

1024
00:48:55,948 --> 00:49:00,119
<i>I'd climb walls
I'd shoot web from my wrists</i>

1025
00:49:00,828 --> 00:49:05,374
<i>And I'd save the girl in distress</i>

1026
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:09,086
<i>Gay! Gay! Gay!</i>

1027
00:49:10,379 --> 00:49:12,673
I think he thinks
gay means being Spider-Man.

1028
00:49:14,216 --> 00:49:16,885
I don't know how you would
confuse those two things.

1029
00:49:17,344 --> 00:49:22,600
<i>It's a big world Big world</i>

1030
00:49:23,142 --> 00:49:25,519
<i>Much bigger than you think</i>

1031
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:30,691
<i>Big, big, big, big, big, big,
big, big, big, big, big</i>

1032
00:49:30,941 --> 00:49:35,446
<i>Big, big-...</i>

1033
00:49:37,364 --> 00:49:42,161
<i>World</i>

1034
00:49:48,167 --> 00:49:50,586
Launch in five! Let's get back to work.

1035
00:49:51,086 --> 00:49:53,964
- Better go check the AP wire.
- Yeah. Haven't got much time.

1036
00:49:54,173 --> 00:49:55,549
I'm gonna check the box scores.

1037
00:49:57,217 --> 00:49:59,553
There's Lime!

1038
00:49:59,637 --> 00:50:02,473
Look at him. He's a goddamn prince!

1039
00:50:03,307 --> 00:50:05,976
Man, there's just something
about him, you know?

1040
00:50:06,268 --> 00:50:08,270
I'd give anything to be friends with him.

1041
00:50:08,646 --> 00:50:10,939
I don't see what
the big deal is, you know.

1042
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:12,524
He's not that great.

1043
00:50:14,234 --> 00:50:15,486
What did you say?

1044
00:50:16,195 --> 00:50:17,529
What's that?

1045
00:50:17,738 --> 00:50:19,156
I heard you say something.

1046
00:50:20,574 --> 00:50:22,910
Oh, what did I say? Oh, nothing.

1047
00:50:23,243 --> 00:50:24,745
Oh, no. I heard you say something.

1048
00:50:24,995 --> 00:50:26,497
He said you're not that great!

1049
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:27,581
Brick!

1050
00:50:27,706 --> 00:50:29,249
Is that what you said about me?

1051
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:31,001
- He's coming over here.
- I know!

1052
00:50:31,251 --> 00:50:32,920
I'm gonna rip this guy in half.

1053
00:50:33,754 --> 00:50:36,090
No, no, no! Just give me
a little piece of him.

1054
00:50:36,548 --> 00:50:38,467
Jack, look, it's just...

1055
00:50:41,011 --> 00:50:44,807
Here's the thing, the guys,
they just go gaga over you

1056
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:49,770
and I don't know, I felt jealous.

1057
00:50:50,145 --> 00:50:52,064
Yeah, tough guy.

1058
00:50:52,189 --> 00:50:54,274
You feeling tough today, huh?
Are you a big man?

1059
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:56,068
Oh, I'm not a big man.

1060
00:50:56,485 --> 00:50:59,154
Look, I said some stupid stuff
and it'll never happen again.

1061
00:51:00,072 --> 00:51:01,573
Oh, my God, are you going to cry?

1062
00:51:03,826 --> 00:51:04,827
You're going to cry.

1063
00:51:05,411 --> 00:51:07,996
He's going to cry. Everyone,
look at his face! Am I wrong?

1064
00:51:08,414 --> 00:51:09,873
He's going to cry, isn't he?

1065
00:51:10,374 --> 00:51:11,917
No, I'm not about to cry.

1066
00:51:12,167 --> 00:51:15,379
Oh, come on, cry! Do it!
Do it, please do it! Cry.

1067
00:51:15,754 --> 00:51:18,048
- Are you going to cry, Ron?
- No!

1068
00:51:18,465 --> 00:51:21,427
Cry! Cry! Cry!

1069
00:51:22,803 --> 00:51:25,764
Man, oh, man, I'm so happy
he's not picking on me.

1070
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:29,184
3, 2, 1,cry! 3, 2, 1,cry!

1071
00:51:31,395 --> 00:51:33,772
Shut up! Just shut up!

1072
00:51:34,606 --> 00:51:37,276
Just shut your mouth... Jack Lame!

1073
00:51:41,697 --> 00:51:45,075
Yeah, Mr. Butt Vagina
has got some fight in him.

1074
00:51:45,868 --> 00:51:48,620
This is bullying and everyone knows it!

1075
00:51:49,037 --> 00:51:51,498
You just called him Jack Lame.
That's not nice.

1076
00:51:51,707 --> 00:51:53,417
He just called me Butt Vagina!

1077
00:51:54,501 --> 00:51:57,376
It's funny,
aren't you the guy who...

1078
00:51:58,607 --> 00:52:01,805
lost his job to his wife?

1079
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:05,262
Shouldn't you be doing her makeup?

1080
00:52:10,476 --> 00:52:11,810
All right, guys, that's enough.

1081
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,353
No, shut up, Freddie!

1082
00:52:13,437 --> 00:52:15,022
Let me handle this one.

1083
00:52:15,606 --> 00:52:17,566
- You listen to me.
- Yeah.

1084
00:52:18,317 --> 00:52:21,612
I bet you that we beat
your ratings tonight.

1085
00:52:23,906 --> 00:52:25,991
I'm sorry. I'm trying to keep it together.

1086
00:52:26,074 --> 00:52:29,536
No, no, no. Don't do this.
You're on at 2:00 a. m.

1087
00:52:29,661 --> 00:52:31,038
Jack has prime time!

1088
00:52:31,121 --> 00:52:33,957
Maybe... No. Hey, Freddie, no, no. Hey.

1089
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:37,211
I'll take that bet. What are the stakes?

1090
00:52:37,795 --> 00:52:40,589
If we lose, I'll leave New York.

1091
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,467
And I'll never read the news again.

1092
00:52:45,177 --> 00:52:46,595
Stop going "Ooh. "

1093
00:52:47,137 --> 00:52:50,140
And if by some snowball's
chance in hell

1094
00:52:50,265 --> 00:52:51,850
Mr. Mustache here

1095
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,435
pulls a miracle out of his ass?

1096
00:52:54,978 --> 00:52:59,316
You change your name
to Jack Lame! Legally.

1097
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:03,278
I like this! You're on, Stretch.

1098
00:53:03,487 --> 00:53:04,988
Everyone heard him?

1099
00:53:05,072 --> 00:53:06,873
- Freddie, you heard him?
- Yeah. I heard him.

1100
00:53:07,407 --> 00:53:09,910
- This is on like Pong.
- Okay. Good.

1101
00:53:14,957 --> 00:53:17,167
Why? Why did you make that bet, Ron?

1102
00:53:17,417 --> 00:53:19,670
We've got the graveyard shift!
We don't have a chance!

1103
00:53:19,962 --> 00:53:22,923
- Cry! Cry! Cry! Cry!
- Brick.

1104
00:53:23,215 --> 00:53:26,510
Everyone did it.
It's actually a mean thing.

1105
00:53:27,636 --> 00:53:31,056
Good day, everyone! Well, yeah,
I'm Kench Allenby.

1106
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:35,102
But this 24-hour news station,
this is history.

1107
00:53:35,435 --> 00:53:38,272
This is like Columbus
discovering the New World.

1108
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,315
In the case of Australia, my motherland,

1109
00:53:40,399 --> 00:53:42,401
mad rapists and thieves

1110
00:53:42,609 --> 00:53:45,612
being dragged to some
devil island in chains.

1111
00:53:46,363 --> 00:53:47,656
Getting homesick.

1112
00:53:48,198 --> 00:53:50,158
But our captain on
this incredible voyage

1113
00:53:50,701 --> 00:53:54,079
is the best newsman in America,
Mr. Jack Lime!

1114
00:53:54,997 --> 00:53:56,957
Go get 'em, Jack!

1115
00:53:57,875 --> 00:54:00,419
- Didgeridoo!
- He's such an Aussie.

1116
00:54:00,502 --> 00:54:01,503
I love this guy.

1117
00:54:01,795 --> 00:54:04,756
You know this bloke here,
he is the best man I've ever met.

1118
00:54:05,173 --> 00:54:06,842
And you know, as I've always said,

1119
00:54:06,925 --> 00:54:09,177
if Jack Lime doesn't like you,
well then, brother,

1120
00:54:09,303 --> 00:54:11,346
you're a real piece of shit.

1121
00:54:19,062 --> 00:54:21,189
Good luck to Jack Lime!

1122
00:54:21,857 --> 00:54:24,026
Go get 'em, Jack! Go get 'em!

1123
00:54:24,568 --> 00:54:26,987
Thank you. And good luck
to Ron Burgundy, too.

1124
00:54:28,989 --> 00:54:30,532
<i>Getting nervous there, compadre?</i>

1125
00:54:31,742 --> 00:54:32,910
Let's do this.

1126
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,329
Did you see him spin
on that desk? So great.

1127
00:54:35,829 --> 00:54:37,414
All right. Quiet on the floor, please.

1128
00:54:37,664 --> 00:54:38,957
What a day.

1129
00:54:39,416 --> 00:54:42,210
I bit into the donut and
it was full of shit.

1130
00:54:47,466 --> 00:54:48,717
All right.

1131
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,427
All right. We're up.
Here we go, here we go.

1132
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:52,137
In five, four,

1133
00:54:53,013 --> 00:54:54,181
three, two...

1134
00:54:55,933 --> 00:54:58,602
Good day, and welcome to GNN.

1135
00:54:58,936 --> 00:55:01,063
Thank you for joining us
on what we believe to be

1136
00:55:01,146 --> 00:55:02,773
a whole new era of news.

1137
00:55:02,981 --> 00:55:05,859
I'm Jack Lime, your guide
for this journey of events

1138
00:55:05,943 --> 00:55:07,235
we humbly call

1139
00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:08,612
24-hour news.

1140
00:55:08,695 --> 00:55:10,948
<i>Today's top story, Mount St. Helene.</i>

1141
00:55:11,031 --> 00:55:13,867
Oh, this is just a gimmick.
It's a flash in the pan.

1142
00:55:13,951 --> 00:55:17,329
Really? Just remember you said that
about margarine, Tony.

1143
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:19,164
<i>Residents are being asked
to evacuate the area...</i>

1144
00:55:19,331 --> 00:55:21,041
That Jack Lime is one hell of an anchor.

1145
00:55:22,334 --> 00:55:26,755
He actually slept with two of
my daughters but he is good.

1146
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:29,257
Let's see here.

1147
00:55:29,341 --> 00:55:30,801
"Global temperatures rise half a degree,

1148
00:55:30,884 --> 00:55:33,095
"alarm climate scientists. " Boring.

1149
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:34,846
"China could dominate

1150
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:36,491
"the world economy in the next decade. "

1151
00:55:37,224 --> 00:55:40,060
We run that story and
you'll be hungry a half hour later.

1152
00:55:41,436 --> 00:55:42,688
Anyone else?

1153
00:55:42,938 --> 00:55:45,857
I got some nonsense here about
the Iran Hostage Crisis.

1154
00:55:47,025 --> 00:55:48,026
I feel like a nap.

1155
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:52,531
What's this? Save 12 cents on
macaroni and cheddar dinner.

1156
00:55:53,824 --> 00:55:55,145
Brick, I believe that's a coupon.

1157
00:55:55,826 --> 00:55:58,161
I think I've got
a really good story here, guys.

1158
00:55:58,996 --> 00:56:00,539
"During my mid-morning bath

1159
00:56:00,622 --> 00:56:03,166
"I could feel the gardener's
gaze upon me

1160
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:05,085
"through the open bathroom window. "

1161
00:56:05,168 --> 00:56:06,712
<i>But that's Penthouse Forum.</i>

1162
00:56:06,962 --> 00:56:07,963
You just interrupted him!

1163
00:56:08,088 --> 00:56:09,673
It's a really good story, Freddie.

1164
00:56:09,923 --> 00:56:10,924
It's not news.

1165
00:56:11,091 --> 00:56:12,426
It's news to me.

1166
00:56:12,676 --> 00:56:15,220
Okay, so obviously this is
a waste of time. I'm done.

1167
00:56:16,054 --> 00:56:18,974
All we're trying to do here, Freddie,
is make the news less boring,

1168
00:56:19,057 --> 00:56:21,518
and you act like we took a runny dump

1169
00:56:21,601 --> 00:56:23,145
in your fishing boots.

1170
00:56:23,437 --> 00:56:25,856
The news is supposed
to be boring, Ron!

1171
00:56:25,981 --> 00:56:27,524
This is serious stuff.

1172
00:56:27,899 --> 00:56:30,068
You're the one
that made this stupid bet!

1173
00:56:30,193 --> 00:56:33,530
I just don't know why
we have to tell the people

1174
00:56:33,613 --> 00:56:35,323
what they need to hear.

1175
00:56:35,991 --> 00:56:38,076
Why can't we just tell them
what they want to hear?

1176
00:56:39,536 --> 00:56:41,204
Wait, wait, wait.

1177
00:56:42,539 --> 00:56:43,874
Say that again.

1178
00:56:44,082 --> 00:56:46,501
Tell them want ear. Feed to ear.

1179
00:56:47,044 --> 00:56:48,962
No, I was talking to Ron.

1180
00:56:49,212 --> 00:56:52,340
I said, why do we have to tell the people

1181
00:56:52,424 --> 00:56:54,217
what they need to hear?

1182
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:57,179
Why can't we just tell them
what they want to hear?

1183
00:56:57,471 --> 00:56:59,306
And what do they want to hear, Ron?

1184
00:56:59,473 --> 00:57:02,476
That we live in the greatest
country God ever created.

1185
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:05,395
- Damn straight!
- Made him happy.

1186
00:57:05,729 --> 00:57:07,773
And we should do stories on patriots.

1187
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:11,109
Diet fads or
favorite Halloween costumes.

1188
00:57:11,568 --> 00:57:14,237
Why blondes have more fun.

1189
00:57:14,613 --> 00:57:16,281
And serious investigative pieces,

1190
00:57:16,406 --> 00:57:18,909
about how much ejaculate
is on hotel duvets.

1191
00:57:19,034 --> 00:57:21,036
And only the best sports highlights.

1192
00:57:21,453 --> 00:57:24,790
Home runs, slam dunks,
touchdowns and no soccer.

1193
00:57:25,082 --> 00:57:26,249
I like the Wind!

1194
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:28,460
Brick's right. People love hurricanes.

1195
00:57:28,543 --> 00:57:30,003
Tornados, earthquakes, floods,

1196
00:57:30,253 --> 00:57:32,013
we'll throw Brick right
in the middle of it.

1197
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:34,925
No, this goes against every rule

1198
00:57:35,008 --> 00:57:37,427
of broadcast journalism I know.

1199
00:57:38,011 --> 00:57:41,473
Freddie, my old friend
Pat Summerall once told me,

1200
00:57:41,598 --> 00:57:43,058
"You've got to break a few eggs

1201
00:57:43,141 --> 00:57:44,810
"when you're swinging a sledge hammer

1202
00:57:44,893 --> 00:57:46,144
"down at the bus station. "

1203
00:57:46,311 --> 00:57:48,396
Damn straight! Let's break stuff!

1204
00:57:49,397 --> 00:57:51,066
We got 10 hours till we go on.

1205
00:57:51,149 --> 00:57:52,400
We'll only need eight!

1206
00:58:28,353 --> 00:58:30,689
- Is that candy?
- I don't know.

1207
00:58:37,195 --> 00:58:38,196
It is candy.

1208
00:58:39,322 --> 00:58:41,658
- I like you.
- I like you.

1209
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:44,119
Tell me something about you.

1210
00:58:44,369 --> 00:58:45,912
Well, I never have to get a haircut

1211
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:47,455
because my hair naturally sheds.

1212
00:58:47,956 --> 00:58:50,667
I can throw a football
110 yards in the air

1213
00:58:51,084 --> 00:58:52,335
and catch it.

1214
00:58:52,836 --> 00:58:55,130
When I expel gas it wiffles or waffles,

1215
00:58:55,213 --> 00:58:56,590
I call it a farg.

1216
00:58:57,090 --> 00:58:58,091
What about you?

1217
00:58:58,258 --> 00:59:00,093
My name is Chani LastnamÃ©.

1218
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:03,138
I'm an old-fashioned girl,
I believe in romance.

1219
00:59:03,471 --> 00:59:05,223
I am related to a puppet.

1220
00:59:05,724 --> 00:59:07,976
If you wanted me to, I would
grow a beard by tomorrow.

1221
00:59:09,186 --> 00:59:12,355
Chani, I just got these phone
messages from last week.

1222
00:59:12,522 --> 00:59:13,773
You mailed them to me?

1223
00:59:14,107 --> 00:59:16,109
How else was I gonna get them to you?

1224
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:18,069
You hand them to me.

1225
00:59:19,362 --> 00:59:21,781
You are the dumbest person
I've met in my entire life,

1226
00:59:21,907 --> 00:59:23,950
and that is not an exaggeration.

1227
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:25,285
That makes me feel bad.

1228
00:59:25,493 --> 00:59:27,662
Well, Chani, I'm telling the truth.

1229
00:59:30,123 --> 00:59:31,124
Sir.

1230
00:59:31,291 --> 00:59:34,002
Get your filthy hands off of her!

1231
00:59:34,211 --> 00:59:35,337
Help, help!

1232
00:59:36,004 --> 00:59:37,547
My phone messages!

1233
00:59:37,964 --> 00:59:40,717
- Leave me alone, lady!
- Not today!

1234
00:59:41,801 --> 00:59:45,722
She has rainbow lasers
coming out of her eyes.

1235
00:59:46,139 --> 00:59:49,059
Chani, I can see you behind
that desk and you're fired!

1236
00:59:49,684 --> 00:59:50,852
Why?

1237
00:59:59,819 --> 01:00:01,238
Are you okay?

1238
01:00:02,572 --> 01:00:03,907
You saved my life.

1239
01:00:04,032 --> 01:00:05,200
She was trying to murder me.

1240
01:00:05,867 --> 01:00:10,205
Sometimes it takes one man to
stand up and reclaim the city

1241
01:00:10,914 --> 01:00:13,833
and, in doing so, the streets
are red with blood.

1242
01:00:14,167 --> 01:00:18,255
When you're around I get
hot swirls in my pantyhose.

1243
01:00:18,546 --> 01:00:20,674
And my dangle-down presses
against my zipper.

1244
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,056
Can we go to a date?

1245
01:00:28,139 --> 01:00:30,016
Yes.

1246
01:00:39,943 --> 01:00:43,405
It's okay, Ronny,
you got this. Piece of cake.

1247
01:00:45,073 --> 01:00:48,618
The only thing is
everything's at stake here.

1248
01:00:48,994 --> 01:00:52,122
Your career, your child,
literally everything.

1249
01:00:52,414 --> 01:00:53,790
You got it though.

1250
01:00:55,875 --> 01:00:56,918
Oh, did you hear?

1251
01:00:57,002 --> 01:00:59,212
Evan said there's some
strange copy in the prompter.

1252
01:00:59,395 --> 01:01:01,315
If I gave a shit I'd call
someone. But I don't...

1253
01:01:01,339 --> 01:01:02,340
So let's go.

1254
01:01:02,882 --> 01:01:04,634
<i>Ron Burgundy and his news team</i>

1255
01:01:04,843 --> 01:01:07,554
<i>had made a few groundbreaking
discoveries through the years.</i>

1256
01:01:07,721 --> 01:01:09,597
<i>They had invented the bread bowl</i>

1257
01:01:09,681 --> 01:01:11,558
<i>and laminated porn mags.</i>

1258
01:01:11,641 --> 01:01:13,685
<i>But the new brand of news,
or info-tainment,</i>

1259
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:15,270
<i>they were about to unleash,</i>

1260
01:01:15,478 --> 01:01:17,564
<i>would forever change history.</i>

1261
01:01:17,731 --> 01:01:20,734
Hello, America. It's 2:00 a. m.
Eastern time.

1262
01:01:20,984 --> 01:01:24,654
I'm Ron Burgundy,
and tonight's top story is

1263
01:01:24,946 --> 01:01:28,408
America. She's the greatest
country in the world.

1264
01:01:28,616 --> 01:01:30,368
<i>Heck, the history of the world!</i>

1265
01:01:30,577 --> 01:01:32,162
God bless America!

1266
01:01:33,413 --> 01:01:34,914
<i>For starters, we kick butt.</i>

1267
01:01:35,332 --> 01:01:38,710
Nazi butt. Russian butt.
You show us a butt

1268
01:01:38,835 --> 01:01:40,295
and we take the boot to it.

1269
01:01:40,378 --> 01:01:42,505
If you like to whine and bitch
about all the things

1270
01:01:42,589 --> 01:01:43,590
wrong with America,

1271
01:01:43,673 --> 01:01:46,343
go swim your ass across
the Atlantic Ocean to China!

1272
01:01:47,177 --> 01:01:48,470
That is one handsome devil.

1273
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:50,055
Indeed.

1274
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:52,807
Some experts say silicone
breast implants are dangerous,

1275
01:01:52,974 --> 01:01:54,934
<i>unhealthy and degrading to women,</i>

1276
01:01:55,101 --> 01:01:57,771
<i>I say, in my most journalistic way I can,</i>

1277
01:01:57,979 --> 01:01:59,898
<i>bring on the fun bags.</i>

1278
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:02,984
Now, Brian, I read somewhere

1279
01:02:03,068 --> 01:02:05,278
that the early prototypes
of the breast implant

1280
01:02:05,403 --> 01:02:07,197
were actually filled with taco meat.

1281
01:02:07,364 --> 01:02:09,783
Well, I don't know,
I don't know the specifics

1282
01:02:09,866 --> 01:02:11,534
but I do know they are still testing

1283
01:02:11,618 --> 01:02:13,828
with all sorts of material.

1284
01:02:14,162 --> 01:02:17,040
Pudding, whipped cream...

1285
01:02:17,791 --> 01:02:18,792
Tuna fish.

1286
01:02:18,875 --> 01:02:19,876
<i>Nickels.</i>

1287
01:02:19,959 --> 01:02:21,439
<i>Okay, if you wanted a heavier breast.</i>

1288
01:02:22,379 --> 01:02:23,838
I like the news!

1289
01:02:24,047 --> 01:02:25,382
Whammy! Whammy!

1290
01:02:25,548 --> 01:02:27,217
Whammy! Whammy! Whammy!

1291
01:02:27,342 --> 01:02:29,177
Whammy!

1292
01:02:36,142 --> 01:02:37,227
Back to you, Ron.

1293
01:02:37,310 --> 01:02:39,479
Brick? Brick, can you hear me?

1294
01:02:39,813 --> 01:02:41,314
I can't hear you, Ron!

1295
01:02:41,731 --> 01:02:43,775
Okay, but you're answering
the question,

1296
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,193
so I think you can hear me.

1297
01:02:45,485 --> 01:02:46,569
No, I can!

1298
01:02:46,653 --> 01:02:48,488
Brick, do you think there is any danger

1299
01:02:48,613 --> 01:02:49,948
to the average person out there?

1300
01:02:50,281 --> 01:02:52,534
<i>I'm afraid that this wind is so strong</i>

1301
01:02:52,659 --> 01:02:54,285
that babies are going to be

1302
01:02:54,369 --> 01:02:55,829
ripped out of their mother's arms

1303
01:02:55,912 --> 01:02:58,164
and be into the lion cages.

1304
01:02:58,748 --> 01:03:01,376
Sounds horrifying!
Well, there you have it.

1305
01:03:02,085 --> 01:03:05,338
Mother Nature can be
a stone cold killer!

1306
01:03:05,588 --> 01:03:06,589
What the hell was that?

1307
01:03:06,673 --> 01:03:08,274
Freddie loaded it. I just hit it on cue.

1308
01:03:08,633 --> 01:03:09,634
It's kinda cool.

1309
01:03:10,051 --> 01:03:13,388
And for our eighth and final
animal story of the night,

1310
01:03:13,638 --> 01:03:16,266
it looks like residents
of North Yulk, Montana,

1311
01:03:16,349 --> 01:03:17,789
have found the cutest little patriot

1312
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:19,978
<i>on God's green earth.</i>

1313
01:03:23,565 --> 01:03:24,983
Look at that little guy!

1314
01:03:25,275 --> 01:03:27,944
So funny and so adorable.

1315
01:03:28,445 --> 01:03:31,573
For all of us here at GNN,
I'm Ron Burgundy.

1316
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:35,869
Stay classy and stay strong, America.

1317
01:03:38,663 --> 01:03:39,998
And we're out!

1318
01:03:40,123 --> 01:03:41,458
Wow!

1319
01:03:42,584 --> 01:03:44,002
I couldn't take my eyes

1320
01:03:44,169 --> 01:03:45,837
- off the screen!
- Yes.

1321
01:03:46,504 --> 01:03:48,173
You were electric, Ron! Whammy!

1322
01:03:48,423 --> 01:03:50,091
That just felt right! That felt right!

1323
01:03:50,341 --> 01:03:51,426
I was outside!

1324
01:03:51,676 --> 01:03:53,261
You sure were, Brick. Wonderful job.

1325
01:03:53,344 --> 01:03:55,930
Everyone did. Wonderful.

1326
01:03:57,223 --> 01:03:58,725
Amazing. Great job.

1327
01:03:58,808 --> 01:04:02,729
What the hell was that?
What the hell was that?

1328
01:04:03,015 --> 01:04:04,415
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy, Linda.

1329
01:04:04,439 --> 01:04:05,800
We were just trying something new.

1330
01:04:05,899 --> 01:04:07,609
You changed the format
of the entire show

1331
01:04:07,692 --> 01:04:09,372
without consulting me?
That's unacceptable!

1332
01:04:09,569 --> 01:04:10,653
Damn straight, sister.

1333
01:04:10,737 --> 01:04:12,405
We just done went and brought it!

1334
01:04:12,489 --> 01:04:15,074
Get out! You are all
terminated immediately.

1335
01:04:15,742 --> 01:04:17,577
If you were a man, I'd knock you out.

1336
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:20,038
Oh, really? Well, go ahead!

1337
01:04:20,163 --> 01:04:22,165
Take a swing! Take your best shot!

1338
01:04:22,332 --> 01:04:24,125
I have five brothers,

1339
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:26,370
and two of them are defensive
backs in NFL, so come on!

1340
01:04:26,794 --> 01:04:28,004
- You want me to do it?
- Yeah.

1341
01:04:28,338 --> 01:04:29,659
This thing's not gonna feel good.

1342
01:04:29,923 --> 01:04:31,963
I'm going to make that
mustache of yours all bloody!

1343
01:04:32,133 --> 01:04:34,344
Ron, just do what men have been doing

1344
01:04:34,427 --> 01:04:35,678
for thousands of years

1345
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,597
and punch the woman.

1346
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,391
Here comes the Toledo Express.
All aboard!

1347
01:04:44,312 --> 01:04:45,813
Ron! No!

1348
01:04:48,358 --> 01:04:50,485
I didn't do it! Get off me!

1349
01:04:53,029 --> 01:04:55,698
Mama, your baby's hurt.

1350
01:04:56,199 --> 01:04:57,700
Your baby.

1351
01:04:59,118 --> 01:05:01,871
What is that sound you're making?
Good Lord!

1352
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:05,375
You sound like a balloon.

1353
01:05:05,708 --> 01:05:07,043
Pull yourself together, man.

1354
01:05:07,252 --> 01:05:10,735
My binky. I need my binky.

1355
01:05:10,968 --> 01:05:12,769
Get him his goddamn binky!

1356
01:05:13,007 --> 01:05:14,342
Security!

1357
01:05:14,592 --> 01:05:16,511
Hey! Get him out of here!

1358
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:18,805
And you know what, you too, Freddie!

1359
01:05:18,888 --> 01:05:20,181
I thought you were
more professional than this.

1360
01:05:20,265 --> 01:05:21,305
Is this because I'm white?

1361
01:05:21,641 --> 01:05:23,726
It's not because you're white,
it's because you suck!

1362
01:05:23,851 --> 01:05:25,812
I know exactly what apartheid feels like!

1363
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:30,942
<i>Bugger me with a didgeridoo.</i>

1364
01:05:31,192 --> 01:05:32,610
We knew we'd struggle to start,

1365
01:05:32,694 --> 01:05:35,196
but these ratings are lower
than I'd even imagined.

1366
01:05:35,446 --> 01:05:37,073
Thank God for the 2:00 a. m. spike.

1367
01:05:37,156 --> 01:05:39,033
It really saved our whole launch.

1368
01:05:39,367 --> 01:05:41,536
Spike? What are you talking about?

1369
01:05:41,911 --> 01:05:42,996
What spike?

1370
01:05:43,288 --> 01:05:45,415
Burgundy. Who's Ron Burgundy?

1371
01:05:46,124 --> 01:05:48,251
No, no, no, this can't be right.

1372
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:52,463
His team start at a 0.2,
and then they finish at a 5.6?

1373
01:05:53,464 --> 01:05:56,467
That's unbelievable!
They tripled Jack Lime's numbers!

1374
01:05:56,718 --> 01:05:58,219
How is that even possible?

1375
01:05:58,553 --> 01:06:01,139
Well, guys, it goes without saying,

1376
01:06:01,222 --> 01:06:03,641
I owe you gentlemen an apology.

1377
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,102
I dragged you out here and this thing

1378
01:06:06,185 --> 01:06:08,771
was a disaster from the word "Go. "

1379
01:06:09,022 --> 01:06:11,357
No, Ron, don't you beat yourself up.

1380
01:06:11,608 --> 01:06:13,192
Yeah, it's all right, Ron.

1381
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:14,527
Gin.

1382
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:19,574
Champ, my friend,
what's in store for you?

1383
01:06:19,699 --> 01:06:22,785
Well, my doctor's been at me
to get another liver transplant.

1384
01:06:23,036 --> 01:06:24,829
Champ, how many liver transplants

1385
01:06:24,912 --> 01:06:26,414
does that make now?

1386
01:06:26,497 --> 01:06:27,957
This will be the fourth one.

1387
01:06:28,041 --> 01:06:31,044
Champ deep fried the other three
and sewed them at his restaurant.

1388
01:06:31,210 --> 01:06:32,879
You know I did.

1389
01:06:32,962 --> 01:06:34,547
And what about you, Brick?

1390
01:06:34,631 --> 01:06:37,592
What's next for
the great Brick Tamland?

1391
01:06:37,675 --> 01:06:39,552
I am going to win the Olympics.

1392
01:06:39,677 --> 01:06:42,555
Well, I highly doubt you're going
to compete in the Olympics.

1393
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:43,931
If you were though, what sport?

1394
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:45,475
The kicking.

1395
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:48,478
The Olympic sport of kicking?

1396
01:06:50,438 --> 01:06:51,939
Maybe that's brand new.

1397
01:06:52,398 --> 01:06:55,234
What about you, Ron? What do
you think you're going to do?

1398
01:06:55,318 --> 01:06:56,861
I've got some exciting
investment opportunities

1399
01:06:56,944 --> 01:06:58,279
I'm going to look into.

1400
01:06:58,696 --> 01:07:00,948
It's funny, I got a call
the other day from some clowns

1401
01:07:01,032 --> 01:07:02,158
who are trying to start up a business

1402
01:07:02,241 --> 01:07:04,827
where they take water and
put it in little plastic bottles,

1403
01:07:04,911 --> 01:07:07,288
regular water, okay,
nothing special about it.

1404
01:07:07,538 --> 01:07:08,873
They put it in plastic bottles

1405
01:07:08,956 --> 01:07:10,124
and they're going to sell it for a dollar.

1406
01:07:10,208 --> 01:07:11,209
A dollar a bottle.

1407
01:07:11,334 --> 01:07:13,711
If you get a call
from Fred and Gina Sparkletts,

1408
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:15,755
run for the hills.

1409
01:07:21,886 --> 01:07:23,054
Guys?

1410
01:07:23,888 --> 01:07:24,889
Hey.

1411
01:07:25,723 --> 01:07:27,558
I got some news.

1412
01:07:27,809 --> 01:07:29,329
Freddie, we don't exactly want to hear

1413
01:07:29,394 --> 01:07:31,729
- the word "news" right now.
- Yeah.

1414
01:07:32,063 --> 01:07:35,400
You're right. Forget it.
Forget I was even here.

1415
01:07:35,733 --> 01:07:39,070
Forget that GNN wants you back.

1416
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:43,741
For a prime time slot and a raise in pay.

1417
01:07:44,075 --> 01:07:47,829
What's your deal, Freddie?
Quit yanking our crotch hoses.

1418
01:07:48,413 --> 01:07:50,248
No. I'm not yanking your...

1419
01:07:52,083 --> 01:07:54,585
Your ratings went through the roof.

1420
01:07:54,919 --> 01:07:57,755
People love what you did.

1421
01:07:58,089 --> 01:08:00,049
You're a success!

1422
01:08:00,258 --> 01:08:05,096
Get it? You're a great, big, fat success!

1423
01:08:05,638 --> 01:08:08,141
By the back acne of Brett Somers!

1424
01:08:08,224 --> 01:08:09,308
It's total crap

1425
01:08:09,392 --> 01:08:10,893
and they can't stop watching!

1426
01:08:11,769 --> 01:08:14,272
<i>The news team
had been famous in San Diego,</i>

1427
01:08:14,397 --> 01:08:17,483
<i>but that was small time
compared to New York.</i>

1428
01:08:17,984 --> 01:08:20,903
<i>And they were about to have
a sloppy, drunken ride</i>

1429
01:08:21,028 --> 01:08:24,949
<i>down the gin-slickered
waterslide that is fame.</i>

1430
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:26,993
That'll do it for all of us here at GNN.

1431
01:08:27,076 --> 01:08:30,413
Thank God for the events,
thank me for the news.

1432
01:08:30,955 --> 01:08:32,457
I'm Jack...

1433
01:08:35,293 --> 01:08:36,461
Lame.

1434
01:08:40,423 --> 01:08:42,383
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

1435
01:08:42,467 --> 01:08:43,676
More graphics, okay?

1436
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,636
Brick loves the colors.

1437
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,096
But there's already a lot.

1438
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:49,432
Hey, you heard the man. More graphics.

1439
01:08:49,515 --> 01:08:51,142
Yeah, don't sass me, beardo!

1440
01:08:51,476 --> 01:08:53,978
Finish and ask a question here,
for God's sake!

1441
01:08:54,061 --> 01:08:57,523
Can Father Ron please shut
his mouth for just half a second?

1442
01:09:28,095 --> 01:09:30,389
There's something new
on the New York social scene.

1443
01:09:30,515 --> 01:09:33,392
It's fun, relatively benign
and costs about as much

1444
01:09:33,518 --> 01:09:35,561
as a soda pop at the local drugstore.

1445
01:09:35,686 --> 01:09:39,315
Here's Brian Fantana on
why everyone who is someone

1446
01:09:39,398 --> 01:09:41,400
is lining up to smoke crack.

1447
01:09:41,901 --> 01:09:44,153
Now, Brian, I understand
we have some crack

1448
01:09:44,237 --> 01:09:45,905
and we're going to smoke it
right here in the studio.

1449
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:47,782
I don't know if we can get a shot of that.

1450
01:09:47,907 --> 01:09:50,108
What is that? Did you know
they were going to have that?

1451
01:09:50,243 --> 01:09:51,283
<i>- No.
- Get in here, Champ.</i>

1452
01:09:51,369 --> 01:09:52,912
I'll tell you, I love cocaine

1453
01:09:53,037 --> 01:09:54,789
so if this is anything like that...

1454
01:09:54,914 --> 01:09:56,999
Oh, then you're going to love crack!

1455
01:09:57,083 --> 01:09:58,292
Now what are we doing here?

1456
01:09:58,543 --> 01:10:00,183
We're going to take
some of these rocks...

1457
01:10:00,253 --> 01:10:01,254
Okay.

1458
01:10:01,379 --> 01:10:02,755
Now what you're going to do is
you're going to

1459
01:10:02,839 --> 01:10:04,924
put your crack rock in the glass pipe.

1460
01:10:05,007 --> 01:10:07,969
I'll pack it in there.
Brick, do you want any crack?

1461
01:10:09,971 --> 01:10:11,681
Sorry, I'm afraid of fire.

1462
01:10:11,764 --> 01:10:12,807
Now what am I doing here?

1463
01:10:12,932 --> 01:10:14,053
Stuff that rock in your pipe

1464
01:10:14,058 --> 01:10:15,893
and then you're going
to want to point your pipe up

1465
01:10:15,977 --> 01:10:17,770
towards the heavens as if you're saying,

1466
01:10:17,895 --> 01:10:19,575
"Thank you, God,
for giving me this crack. "

1467
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,773
Okay.

1468
01:10:26,070 --> 01:10:28,573
You feel that right away.
Wow, that's good!

1469
01:10:28,656 --> 01:10:31,492
That's an immediate state of euphoria.

1470
01:10:31,742 --> 01:10:34,287
You'll be surprised,
the effect, it happens very...

1471
01:10:35,788 --> 01:10:38,875
You just want more and more
and more and more and more.

1472
01:10:39,166 --> 01:10:41,335
Brian, hey listen, my mom's
got this diamond necklace

1473
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,170
and I'll sell it to you
if I can get some more.

1474
01:10:43,296 --> 01:10:45,006
They're actually enjoying it.

1475
01:10:45,339 --> 01:10:47,341
Of course they're enjoying it. It's crack.

1476
01:10:47,508 --> 01:10:49,302
What's that? Stop!

1477
01:10:49,969 --> 01:10:51,846
Oh, apparently the police are here.

1478
01:10:51,971 --> 01:10:53,639
The police are here? Really?

1479
01:10:53,764 --> 01:10:57,977
For Ron Burgundy and
my whole crack news team...

1480
01:11:01,105 --> 01:11:02,523
I just made that up.

1481
01:11:02,648 --> 01:11:04,442
That was a good one, Ron.
That's actually a very good one.

1482
01:11:04,525 --> 01:11:05,526
You should write that down.
Is that written?

1483
01:11:05,651 --> 01:11:07,331
Well, we got it recorded now.
That's great!

1484
01:11:09,447 --> 01:11:13,159
Well, now we know, guys,
you can't smoke crack on live television.

1485
01:11:25,796 --> 01:11:27,506
Please come in and shut the door.

1486
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,388
If this is about sweeps,

1487
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:37,475
I think Brian Fantana
found an outstanding story.

1488
01:11:37,558 --> 01:11:39,518
It's about airplane parts

1489
01:11:39,685 --> 01:11:42,855
that are falling off of
airplanes out of the sky

1490
01:11:43,147 --> 01:11:44,523
and hitting the ground, people.

1491
01:11:44,649 --> 01:11:46,108
We're calling it "Death From Above. "

1492
01:11:46,192 --> 01:11:49,445
We might do some interviews
with airline stewardesses,

1493
01:11:49,528 --> 01:11:52,531
in bikinis, to get their viewpoint.

1494
01:11:52,698 --> 01:11:54,408
You. Come here.

1495
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:01,249
I've been watching you.

1496
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:02,918
You have?

1497
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:06,588
I've been watching you a lot.

1498
01:12:07,255 --> 01:12:08,924
And you just do whatever you want.

1499
01:12:09,049 --> 01:12:12,094
Well, I'm a bit of a maverick, I guess.

1500
01:12:12,427 --> 01:12:13,929
You don't follow the format.

1501
01:12:14,054 --> 01:12:16,390
You pretty much walk around like...

1502
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:18,799
Like you're king of the world.

1503
01:12:19,226 --> 01:12:22,062
I'm just a worker bee. That's all I am.

1504
01:12:22,437 --> 01:12:24,272
- You know what?
- What?

1505
01:12:29,236 --> 01:12:30,946
I find it hot as shit!

1506
01:12:31,238 --> 01:12:32,239
Are you going to hurt me?

1507
01:12:32,406 --> 01:12:34,866
Well, it depends. Is that what you like?

1508
01:12:35,242 --> 01:12:37,202
God, no. Who wants to be injured?

1509
01:12:38,412 --> 01:12:41,248
Have you ever heard
the expression, "Hurts so good"?

1510
01:12:41,915 --> 01:12:44,292
Yes, I've always been baffled by it.

1511
01:12:44,584 --> 01:12:46,378
The idea of rolling an ankle

1512
01:12:46,461 --> 01:12:48,755
or banging your elbow on a coffee table

1513
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:50,424
and deriving pleasure from it,

1514
01:12:50,549 --> 01:12:52,426
it's very perplexing to me.

1515
01:12:52,509 --> 01:12:53,927
Here's the thing, Mr. Burgundy.

1516
01:12:54,219 --> 01:12:57,222
You're a shooting star
and I want to go for a ride.

1517
01:12:57,305 --> 01:12:58,807
God, I'm so afraid right now.

1518
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:01,226
Come in.

1519
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:03,478
Linda.

1520
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:05,772
Excuse me, Linda.

1521
01:13:05,897 --> 01:13:07,524
Ron, Jack wants to know

1522
01:13:07,607 --> 01:13:10,193
if he can go back to
calling himself Jack Lime

1523
01:13:10,277 --> 01:13:11,445
instead of Jack Lame.

1524
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:13,071
He's really struggling with it.

1525
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:15,657
No. Can't. It's a bet.

1526
01:13:16,241 --> 01:13:17,576
Oh, Jesus!

1527
01:13:17,743 --> 01:13:19,536
If you want to change it, you can.

1528
01:13:19,619 --> 01:13:20,829
Like what?

1529
01:13:21,121 --> 01:13:22,122
Jack Off?

1530
01:13:22,497 --> 01:13:24,666
GNN's Jack Off.

1531
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:27,502
Jack... No, that's worse.
You know it's worse.

1532
01:13:27,919 --> 01:13:29,296
It sounds like jack off!

1533
01:13:29,546 --> 01:13:30,756
Art Areola.

1534
01:13:32,632 --> 01:13:34,468
Sounds ethnic. It almost sounds Italian.

1535
01:13:34,593 --> 01:13:36,887
Freddie, I can't...
Listen to me, Burgundy.

1536
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:38,972
This is far from over, do you hear me?

1537
01:13:39,639 --> 01:13:41,641
I'll see you on the playground.

1538
01:13:47,481 --> 01:13:48,982
This

1539
01:13:49,483 --> 01:13:51,151
meeting has been

1540
01:13:51,651 --> 01:13:53,153
very productive.

1541
01:13:53,487 --> 01:13:55,280
You can pick me up at 8:00.

1542
01:13:57,115 --> 01:14:00,494
Oh, my God, I think I just
tore my undercarriage.

1543
01:14:01,161 --> 01:14:03,914
Oh, man. He's just like me
but he's a cat!

1544
01:14:03,997 --> 01:14:05,540
That's a cat?

1545
01:14:21,556 --> 01:14:24,893
Oh, Ron. Ron, you are missing
some real high-quality

1546
01:14:25,018 --> 01:14:26,686
<i>Garfield laughs over here!</i>

1547
01:14:28,146 --> 01:14:29,898
I think our boss just raped me.

1548
01:14:30,023 --> 01:14:31,023
What?

1549
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:33,026
I don't know what happened.

1550
01:14:33,151 --> 01:14:36,363
But Linda Jackson
got very physical with me.

1551
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:39,032
I knew it. She's probably in a gang.

1552
01:14:39,366 --> 01:14:42,119
I mean, there was just a ball of motion

1553
01:14:42,202 --> 01:14:45,789
and sweat and hair and noises.

1554
01:14:46,039 --> 01:14:47,290
Sounds like she wants you.

1555
01:14:47,541 --> 01:14:50,877
Hey, man. The ladies been all over me
since we got crazy famous.

1556
01:14:50,961 --> 01:14:52,129
Not to brag or nothing,

1557
01:14:52,212 --> 01:14:55,048
but I just gave Sheena Easton crabs.

1558
01:14:55,632 --> 01:14:58,885
That is in no way a brag, Brian.
That's horrible.

1559
01:14:59,052 --> 01:15:02,055
Hey, it's just doing something
beautiful that two people do.

1560
01:15:02,139 --> 01:15:04,099
Except one of them has
microscopic dust mites

1561
01:15:04,224 --> 01:15:05,809
all over his penis and testicles.

1562
01:15:05,892 --> 01:15:06,893
I'm just saying...

1563
01:15:06,977 --> 01:15:10,564
Don't you think that person
should alert their partner?

1564
01:15:12,732 --> 01:15:14,067
Semantics.

1565
01:15:14,234 --> 01:15:16,319
Sounds to me like it's her fault

1566
01:15:16,403 --> 01:15:17,779
for being a randy gal.

1567
01:15:17,904 --> 01:15:19,239
I have a date!

1568
01:15:19,406 --> 01:15:21,575
- Brick has a date?
- Good for Brick!

1569
01:15:21,783 --> 01:15:22,993
What's a date?

1570
01:15:23,076 --> 01:15:25,579
A date is simply when
two people get together,

1571
01:15:25,704 --> 01:15:27,265
do something social, have a few drinks,

1572
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:28,373
yadda-yadda-yadda...

1573
01:15:28,456 --> 01:15:29,457
Take their shirts off...

1574
01:15:31,168 --> 01:15:32,586
Then you get sticky.

1575
01:15:34,546 --> 01:15:36,107
- Oh, it's okay.
- No, it's a fun thing.

1576
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:37,507
It's fun. It's all right.

1577
01:15:37,674 --> 01:15:40,594
Look. Don't worry, Brick,
we got your back, okay?

1578
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:44,431
First things first, we need to
get you a little protection.

1579
01:15:48,643 --> 01:15:52,772
There it is. Brian Fantana's
glorious cabinet of condoms.

1580
01:15:53,607 --> 01:15:57,110
For you I'm thinking Teddy's Big Stick.

1581
01:15:57,277 --> 01:15:59,958
It's the only one that comes
with the Presidential Seal of Approval.

1582
01:16:00,363 --> 01:16:03,116
This one will fit right into
her oval orifice.

1583
01:16:03,283 --> 01:16:04,576
It's a great condom

1584
01:16:04,659 --> 01:16:07,037
for when you're charging up
San Juan Hill,

1585
01:16:07,204 --> 01:16:09,331
AKA, a lady's puss.

1586
01:16:09,456 --> 01:16:11,625
Particularly good
if you're a Rough Rider.

1587
01:16:11,708 --> 01:16:13,084
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1588
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:14,711
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

1589
01:16:14,794 --> 01:16:16,630
- Clam Dam.
- Clam Dam.

1590
01:16:16,713 --> 01:16:17,714
Clam dam.

1591
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:18,840
Clam dam.

1592
01:16:18,965 --> 01:16:20,398
Clam dam.

1593
01:16:20,869 --> 01:16:21,635
Clam dam.

1594
01:16:21,718 --> 01:16:25,138
It's a non-lubricated condom,
but it'll collect your pearls.

1595
01:16:25,305 --> 01:16:26,556
What about Cock Frock?

1596
01:16:26,723 --> 01:16:28,934
Cock Frock? It's a full body condom.

1597
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:30,352
And you can paint in it.

1598
01:16:30,477 --> 01:16:31,645
Wait a minute.

1599
01:16:32,646 --> 01:16:34,981
Sleeve It to Beaver. It's a great condom.

1600
01:16:35,065 --> 01:16:36,441
Takes you back to a simpler time

1601
01:16:36,524 --> 01:16:38,235
when everything was in black and white.

1602
01:16:38,985 --> 01:16:40,625
It's particularly good if you're going in

1603
01:16:40,654 --> 01:16:42,322
for the Eddie Ass-kill.

1604
01:16:42,489 --> 01:16:44,324
My penis weighs 50 pounds.

1605
01:16:44,407 --> 01:16:46,243
No, it doesn't, Brick.

1606
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:48,411
Thirty pounds.

1607
01:16:49,329 --> 01:16:50,580
Seventeen pounds.

1608
01:16:50,664 --> 01:16:53,333
No, your penis probably weighs
four or five ounces.

1609
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:54,417
Fifty pounds.

1610
01:16:54,501 --> 01:16:56,336
So you just went back
to the original number.

1611
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,301
Thank you, Ron,
and happy St. Patrick's Day

1612
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:05,512
to all of our Native American friends.

1613
01:17:05,845 --> 01:17:07,180
On the big map...

1614
01:17:09,015 --> 01:17:10,183
Where's my map?

1615
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:12,686
There's no map, it's just green.

1616
01:17:12,769 --> 01:17:14,062
No, there's a map there.

1617
01:17:14,187 --> 01:17:17,107
- Look at the monitor.
- Right.

1618
01:17:17,357 --> 01:17:18,942
Ron, where's my legs?

1619
01:17:19,025 --> 01:17:20,705
- Where are my legs?
- Your legs are there.

1620
01:17:20,777 --> 01:17:22,237
I don't have any legs, Ron.

1621
01:17:22,362 --> 01:17:23,363
Your legs are fine.

1622
01:17:23,446 --> 01:17:24,823
The color of your pants

1623
01:17:24,906 --> 01:17:26,866
just matches
the chroma key behind you.

1624
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:29,035
See you're standing right now
on your legs.

1625
01:17:30,745 --> 01:17:33,039
Brick, it looks like it's hot in Texas.

1626
01:17:33,206 --> 01:17:34,374
Ron, I'm a ghost.

1627
01:17:38,962 --> 01:17:40,442
Brick, do you want to do the weather?

1628
01:17:40,672 --> 01:17:42,465
- No. No, thanks.
- No?

1629
01:17:42,716 --> 01:17:44,342
You want to come back to the weather?

1630
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:45,927
- Nope.
- Nope. Okay.

1631
01:17:46,052 --> 01:17:48,471
Ron, tell me what this looks like.

1632
01:17:48,555 --> 01:17:50,807
Okay, Brick, it's live television,
my friend.

1633
01:17:50,890 --> 01:17:52,684
Why don't we go to commercial break...

1634
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,978
It's 50 degrees in this state.

1635
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:57,689
We don't have a commercial lined up.

1636
01:17:57,772 --> 01:17:59,399
I'm going to take out my real one.

1637
01:17:59,524 --> 01:18:00,734
No, no, no, no, no!

1638
01:18:01,067 --> 01:18:03,987
And after I received my Masters
in Journalism from Columbia,

1639
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:07,240
I got a job with the London bureau
for ABC News.

1640
01:18:07,907 --> 01:18:09,075
Wow, London.

1641
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:11,578
Arguably one of my favorite
cities in the entire world.

1642
01:18:11,661 --> 01:18:13,288
I put it in my top 90,

1643
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:15,582
right in between Omaha

1644
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:17,959
and Jacksonville, Florida.

1645
01:18:18,418 --> 01:18:21,421
So, tell me, what are some
of your favorite haunts?

1646
01:18:21,504 --> 01:18:23,256
Well, I love it all.

1647
01:18:24,924 --> 01:18:28,053
Big Ben. The Tower of London.

1648
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:30,930
Naughty Hill. The Wailing Wall.

1649
01:18:31,097 --> 01:18:34,434
Grabbing a sherbet and
walking along the Thames.

1650
01:18:34,517 --> 01:18:36,436
It's pronounced "Thames. "

1651
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:39,105
Piccadilly, the Beatles.

1652
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:41,399
The Beatles aren't a place.

1653
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:43,485
The Beatles' Building.

1654
01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:46,279
Where the Beatles spent a lot
of their time as young men.

1655
01:18:46,363 --> 01:18:48,156
Where they learned how to be a Beatle.

1656
01:18:48,281 --> 01:18:51,034
Beatles' Building,
right in downtown London.

1657
01:18:51,451 --> 01:18:53,536
Yeah, I was in London for two years

1658
01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:56,122
and I never heard of a Beatles' Building.

1659
01:18:57,624 --> 01:19:01,378
You got me. I've never been there.

1660
01:19:01,628 --> 01:19:03,546
I couldn't even find it on a map.

1661
01:19:03,713 --> 01:19:05,215
Mr. Burgundy, are you nervous?

1662
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:06,466
God, yes.

1663
01:19:06,716 --> 01:19:08,802
Did I scare you by coming on so strong?

1664
01:19:09,052 --> 01:19:10,303
A little bit, sure.

1665
01:19:10,637 --> 01:19:12,317
Look, it's not that you're not attractive,

1666
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:14,766
it's just I'm a little old-fashioned.

1667
01:19:14,849 --> 01:19:18,061
Well, I am a modern woman.

1668
01:19:18,478 --> 01:19:19,604
And let me tell you,

1669
01:19:19,687 --> 01:19:22,565
when I see something
that I want, I go for it.

1670
01:19:22,816 --> 01:19:24,177
We're going to do this, aren't we?

1671
01:19:24,401 --> 01:19:27,904
We most definitely are going to do this.

1672
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,744
This is the nicest soda machine
anyone's ever taken me to.

1673
01:20:23,877 --> 01:20:25,545
Can I ask you a personal question?

1674
01:20:25,879 --> 01:20:27,547
I'm not sure what that is, but yes.

1675
01:20:27,797 --> 01:20:29,466
Have you ever kissed anyone?

1676
01:20:29,549 --> 01:20:32,135
Do lunch boxes
and sleeping people count?

1677
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:33,887
Of course.

1678
01:20:34,137 --> 01:20:37,557
Then, yes. I have kissed
Scooby Doo and Roy.

1679
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,602
I tongue-kissed a lawn jockey.

1680
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:43,897
I once pooped in the basement
of the Lincoln Memorial.

1681
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:45,732
The Lincoln Memorial has a bathroom?

1682
01:20:45,899 --> 01:20:47,817
No, but they have a basement.

1683
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:51,196
I feel like if I knew how,

1684
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:53,990
I would start to sing
a love song right now.

1685
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,576
I feel like I'm about
to watch you start to sing.

1686
01:20:57,118 --> 01:21:02,123
<i>I feel like I'm about
to sing a love song to you</i>

1687
01:21:02,999 --> 01:21:08,963
<i>And I feel like I'm about to
sing the same love song to you</i>

1688
01:21:09,923 --> 01:21:14,928
<i>I don't know how to do it
but I think it starts like this</i>

1689
01:21:15,053 --> 01:21:16,471
<i>Do do do la do do</i>

1690
01:21:16,596 --> 01:21:18,932
<i>It continues like do do do doo</i>

1691
01:21:19,182 --> 01:21:21,768
<i>Because I love you so</i>

1692
01:21:22,143 --> 01:21:26,356
<i>And sometimes in a love song
an eagle flies over and goes</i>

1693
01:21:27,941 --> 01:21:30,527
<i>Lots of animals are in love songs</i>

1694
01:21:31,277 --> 01:21:35,198
<i>You got the eagle, the bunny,
the rabbit, the squirrel</i>

1695
01:21:35,365 --> 01:21:36,783
<i>And the bunny goes...</i>

1696
01:21:39,118 --> 01:21:42,121
<i>Bunny love in a love song</i>

1697
01:21:42,872 --> 01:21:47,794
<i>And we just sang our first love song</i>

1698
01:21:47,877 --> 01:21:53,466
<i>Together</i>

1699
01:22:01,015 --> 01:22:04,185
I think I'm ready to maybe
try that kiss thing now.

1700
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:06,896
I'll be so careful not to
bite a hole in your cheek.

1701
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:44,058
Hello, Ms. Jackson.

1702
01:22:44,726 --> 01:22:46,019
I didn't mean to scare you.

1703
01:22:46,102 --> 01:22:48,771
Mr. Allenby, I wasn't expecting you to...

1704
01:22:48,938 --> 01:22:51,107
Yeah, no, I know. Neither was I.

1705
01:22:52,358 --> 01:22:54,068
But then I heard about this little story

1706
01:22:54,193 --> 01:22:56,988
that Ron Burgundy and
Brian Fantana are running.

1707
01:22:57,071 --> 01:22:59,198
You see, some of the planes
from my airline

1708
01:22:59,282 --> 01:23:01,242
have had parts falling off them lately.

1709
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:03,536
Is it a problem? Yeah.

1710
01:23:03,703 --> 01:23:06,706
Is it being fixed? I don't know, probably.

1711
01:23:06,873 --> 01:23:10,209
But if that story runs,
then Koala stock will plummet.

1712
01:23:10,918 --> 01:23:13,755
We can't just pull the story.
That would be unethical.

1713
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:16,924
We own the news.
We can do whatever we want.

1714
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:19,260
That's one of the perks.

1715
01:23:19,385 --> 01:23:22,972
It's called "synergy. "
One company working with another.

1716
01:23:23,389 --> 01:23:24,932
Mr. Burgundy may well be

1717
01:23:25,058 --> 01:23:27,435
one of the most valuable media tools

1718
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:29,646
that any corporation has ever had.

1719
01:23:30,563 --> 01:23:33,733
Everything he says becomes the truth.

1720
01:23:33,941 --> 01:23:36,569
So you treat him like
the thoroughbred he is

1721
01:23:36,986 --> 01:23:40,323
and, my girl, you could have
a very, very rewarding career.

1722
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:44,243
And who knows, maybe you and I can be

1723
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:48,122
riding thoroughbreds naked off
the coast of Capri.

1724
01:23:48,247 --> 01:23:49,248
No.

1725
01:23:49,415 --> 01:23:51,751
Okay, you can have pants on.
But we'll be topless.

1726
01:23:51,834 --> 01:23:53,628
Mr. Allenby, I'm not going to ride

1727
01:23:53,753 --> 01:23:55,546
on thoroughbred horses
with you topless.

1728
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:57,965
Fine, they can be A I Vs.

1729
01:23:58,132 --> 01:23:59,467
You can be in a bikini,

1730
01:23:59,592 --> 01:24:02,136
and I'll be wearing
my Speedos, swim trunks,

1731
01:24:02,261 --> 01:24:03,513
the ol" budgie-smugglers.

1732
01:24:03,596 --> 01:24:05,973
Look, I would do this for my career

1733
01:24:06,099 --> 01:24:08,101
but I am not sleeping with you.

1734
01:24:10,269 --> 01:24:11,604
To synergy-

1735
01:24:19,946 --> 01:24:22,281
You seem a little quiet, I must say.

1736
01:24:22,782 --> 01:24:26,452
Just so you know, I'm absolutely fine
with going to this family dinner.

1737
01:24:27,286 --> 01:24:28,871
They're going to love you.

1738
01:24:29,872 --> 01:24:32,125
This is delicious!

1739
01:24:34,043 --> 01:24:35,044
So...

1740
01:24:35,628 --> 01:24:37,380
How long have you
and Linda been dating?

1741
01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:38,715
Mother.

1742
01:24:40,133 --> 01:24:42,135
No, it's all right. It's
a logical question.

1743
01:24:43,553 --> 01:24:47,724
Ours is a new love,
but it burns very brightly.

1744
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:50,810
When we get together

1745
01:24:51,227 --> 01:24:53,813
we're like an Oreo cookie
covered in sweat.

1746
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:56,149
Isn't that right, my Nubian sex princess?

1747
01:24:56,315 --> 01:24:57,984
What are you talking about?

1748
01:24:58,067 --> 01:24:59,444
I've touched her booty.

1749
01:24:59,527 --> 01:25:01,988
I put my hands on that booty.
I have done it.

1750
01:25:02,155 --> 01:25:04,741
Oh, now, we don't have conversations
like that over dinner.

1751
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:05,950
What are you doing?

1752
01:25:06,242 --> 01:25:08,911
I'm addressing the white elephant
in the room.

1753
01:25:09,162 --> 01:25:10,538
I'm breaking down the barriers

1754
01:25:10,663 --> 01:25:13,207
of race by assimilation.
That's all I'm doing.

1755
01:25:13,287 --> 01:25:14,727
Well, you're coming off like a jerk.

1756
01:25:14,751 --> 01:25:16,252
I think it's going well.

1757
01:25:16,377 --> 01:25:18,045
We actually don't watch you.

1758
01:25:18,171 --> 01:25:21,048
We find what you've done
with the news offensive.

1759
01:25:21,215 --> 01:25:23,176
Well, I know
how you're getting your news.

1760
01:25:23,342 --> 01:25:25,720
You're going down
to the corner barber shop

1761
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:28,598
and then Lumpy Jones
comes in and says,

1762
01:25:28,681 --> 01:25:30,099
"I'd like a haircut today.

1763
01:25:30,174 --> 01:25:31,535
"Did you hear what they're doing?"

1764
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:32,685
And then the barber says,

1765
01:25:32,769 --> 01:25:35,855
"Lumpy, I ain't talking to you
until you pay your bill.

1766
01:25:35,938 --> 01:25:37,899
"You haven't paid this bill
in two months. "

1767
01:25:38,024 --> 01:25:40,234
Etcetera, etcetera.
And they tell two friends,

1768
01:25:40,359 --> 01:25:42,487
and they tell two friends
and it spreads that way.

1769
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:43,988
What is your problem, man?

1770
01:25:44,071 --> 01:25:45,271
Hey, black don't crack, right?

1771
01:25:45,364 --> 01:25:46,699
That's what we can at least all agree on.

1772
01:25:46,783 --> 01:25:49,744
If you haven't noticed
we don't converse like that.

1773
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:51,788
Okay, okay.

1774
01:25:51,871 --> 01:25:53,956
Fair enough.
Look at Big Papa down here.

1775
01:25:55,041 --> 01:25:56,083
He's thinking to himself,

1776
01:25:56,209 --> 01:25:59,086
"Shit, look at that white pasty cracker

1777
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:00,900
"sittin' at my table, eatin' my food,

1778
01:26:00,922 --> 01:26:02,381
"in my house,

1779
01:26:02,548 --> 01:26:03,883
"touching my daughter. "

1780
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:06,344
I have. I have touched your daughter.

1781
01:26:06,427 --> 01:26:08,179
- Honey!
- We have done things, Papa.

1782
01:26:08,262 --> 01:26:10,890
You ain't gonna like!
You ain't gonna like it none!

1783
01:26:11,057 --> 01:26:12,683
Oh, my goodness!

1784
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:14,227
I mean when it comes down to it,

1785
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:18,731
I'm just a bad-ass pharaoh
with a big dick and fat wallet.

1786
01:26:18,898 --> 01:26:22,235
Linda, I don't understand
what you are doing with him.

1787
01:26:22,401 --> 01:26:24,362
Oh, you know what I'm coming
at you with,

1788
01:26:24,445 --> 01:26:25,947
you big, black mother of Linda.

1789
01:26:26,072 --> 01:26:29,075
Mix it up in a pot! Making it spicy!

1790
01:26:29,158 --> 01:26:30,201
Oh, my Lord.

1791
01:26:30,284 --> 01:26:31,661
Hey, that's my momma, man.

1792
01:26:31,744 --> 01:26:33,412
Hey, can I get an "Amen"?

1793
01:26:33,496 --> 01:26:35,832
Can I get an "Amen"?

1794
01:26:36,249 --> 01:26:38,501
Seriously though,
folks, can I get an "Amen"?

1795
01:26:38,584 --> 01:26:40,169
Please don't do this.

1796
01:26:40,253 --> 01:26:41,254
It's fine.

1797
01:26:41,337 --> 01:26:44,173
Can any of you crazy-ass
motherfuckers pass me the...

1798
01:26:44,257 --> 01:26:45,550
This man is out of here.

1799
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:47,260
- Get out of my house.
- Oh, okay.

1800
01:26:47,343 --> 01:26:48,761
Get out of my house, Papa.

1801
01:26:48,845 --> 01:26:50,304
Get out of my house!

1802
01:26:50,513 --> 01:26:52,765
This is fun. Get out of my house, man.

1803
01:26:52,849 --> 01:26:54,183
He's telling you to leave.

1804
01:26:54,308 --> 01:26:55,601
Get out of my house!

1805
01:26:55,685 --> 01:26:57,478
I must not be saying it right.

1806
01:26:57,603 --> 01:26:59,772
Get out of my house, you big dummy!

1807
01:26:59,856 --> 01:27:02,066
Get out of my house!

1808
01:27:02,149 --> 01:27:03,568
I can't say it much louder.

1809
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:05,486
Get out of my house! Get out!

1810
01:27:07,446 --> 01:27:09,365
Now I get it! You want me
to leave the house!

1811
01:27:09,448 --> 01:27:10,658
I'm not your big papa!

1812
01:27:10,783 --> 01:27:12,368
Stop! Stop! Dad!

1813
01:27:12,451 --> 01:27:14,531
I don't think that dinner
could have gone any better.

1814
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:15,663
Are you nuts?

1815
01:27:15,955 --> 01:27:18,624
No, I'm not! I had a wonderful evening!

1816
01:27:19,166 --> 01:27:21,002
My dad was kicking you in the head!

1817
01:27:21,294 --> 01:27:23,838
I thought it was like
being jumped into a gang.

1818
01:27:23,963 --> 01:27:25,756
Only with dinner guests!

1819
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:26,966
What?

1820
01:27:27,049 --> 01:27:31,137
I hate to pin it on you,
but you did invite me to dinner.

1821
01:27:31,804 --> 01:27:32,972
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1822
01:27:33,055 --> 01:27:34,140
No, I'm sorry.

1823
01:27:34,223 --> 01:27:37,310
I just... I'm just under
a lot of stress because...

1824
01:27:37,727 --> 01:27:40,313
Because Allenby,
he doesn't want you to do

1825
01:27:40,396 --> 01:27:42,148
the story that you're doing for sweeps.

1826
01:27:42,565 --> 01:27:43,649
"Death From Above. "

1827
01:27:43,733 --> 01:27:45,568
It's an excellent story.
Wonderful expose.

1828
01:27:45,693 --> 01:27:46,986
Listen, Ron.

1829
01:27:48,237 --> 01:27:50,156
Have you ever heard of synergy?

1830
01:27:56,329 --> 01:27:58,706
So your mom thought
we should get together,

1831
01:27:58,915 --> 01:28:00,708
spend a little time.

1832
01:28:01,167 --> 01:28:04,670
She doesn't think I connect
with you as a child.

1833
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:08,341
Can you believe that bullshit?

1834
01:28:08,925 --> 01:28:10,968
Dad, do you like Spider-Man?

1835
01:28:11,052 --> 01:28:13,721
Nope, don't care for him. Never have.

1836
01:28:14,096 --> 01:28:15,473
Don't like the mask,

1837
01:28:15,556 --> 01:28:17,183
the costume, the getup, the webs.

1838
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:19,018
Spider-Man's a poser, son.

1839
01:28:19,101 --> 01:28:20,603
What's a poser?

1840
01:28:20,686 --> 01:28:22,521
A poser is Gary.

1841
01:28:22,688 --> 01:28:24,482
By the way, how is that shit-heel?

1842
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:25,858
What's a shit-heel?

1843
01:28:25,942 --> 01:28:29,862
A shit-heel is a real fun term
that you should call Gary

1844
01:28:29,946 --> 01:28:31,238
every time you see him.

1845
01:28:31,364 --> 01:28:32,740
When he wakes you up
for breakfast say,

1846
01:28:32,865 --> 01:28:34,283
"Oh, good morning, shit-heel. "

1847
01:28:34,408 --> 01:28:36,869
He'll probably give you
five dollars or some candy.

1848
01:28:37,036 --> 01:28:38,704
You're a shit-heel, Dad.

1849
01:28:39,538 --> 01:28:41,457
You should just call Gary that

1850
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:43,042
'cause it makes him really happy.

1851
01:28:43,125 --> 01:28:45,920
It makes me sort of happy
but it makes him really happy.

1852
01:28:46,879 --> 01:28:48,464
Dad.

1853
01:28:48,798 --> 01:28:51,968
Sometimes I hear sounds at night
and I get scared.

1854
01:28:52,051 --> 01:28:54,595
I think there's a ghost in my closet.

1855
01:28:55,221 --> 01:28:56,722
Now, you listen to me, son.

1856
01:28:56,889 --> 01:29:00,059
I'm a grown man, okay. I've done things.

1857
01:29:00,559 --> 01:29:02,228
I've been places.

1858
01:29:02,311 --> 01:29:06,315
I watched the fall of Saigon
from my hotel room

1859
01:29:06,732 --> 01:29:08,109
in Bermuda.

1860
01:29:08,901 --> 01:29:10,236
So I have experience,

1861
01:29:10,486 --> 01:29:12,126
and I'm going to tell you this right now.

1862
01:29:12,279 --> 01:29:16,158
There is no such thing
as ghosts. Case closed.

1863
01:29:16,492 --> 01:29:17,910
Thank you, Daddy.

1864
01:29:17,994 --> 01:29:21,664
There's no such thing
as ghosts, tree werewolves,

1865
01:29:21,831 --> 01:29:25,501
angry store mannequins with dead eyes

1866
01:29:25,584 --> 01:29:27,753
who look at you like this.

1867
01:29:28,421 --> 01:29:30,256
I'm starting to get scared.

1868
01:29:30,339 --> 01:29:32,466
Why? I'm telling you things
that aren't real.

1869
01:29:32,591 --> 01:29:34,093
So what's real that's scary?

1870
01:29:34,427 --> 01:29:35,720
You really want to know

1871
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:37,471
the one thing you should be afraid of?

1872
01:29:37,930 --> 01:29:39,765
Yes, I really do.

1873
01:29:39,932 --> 01:29:41,726
- Voodoo.
- Voodoo?

1874
01:29:41,809 --> 01:29:43,019
Yes, voodoo.

1875
01:29:43,102 --> 01:29:47,815
That shit will mess you up.
And it is 100% real.

1876
01:29:48,024 --> 01:29:49,358
Promise me

1877
01:29:50,026 --> 01:29:51,360
that you'll never go to Haiti.

1878
01:29:51,777 --> 01:29:53,362
I promise, Dad.

1879
01:29:53,446 --> 01:29:55,406
This was good. I enjoyed
spending time with you.

1880
01:29:55,489 --> 01:29:56,657
Me, too, Dad.

1881
01:29:59,785 --> 01:30:00,828
I love you?

1882
01:30:00,953 --> 01:30:01,954
What?

1883
01:30:03,164 --> 01:30:04,957
Are you trying to say you love me?

1884
01:30:05,041 --> 01:30:06,542
No. No.

1885
01:30:08,627 --> 01:30:10,671
What do you think I am,
some kind of fruit?

1886
01:30:10,963 --> 01:30:12,673
What did you tell him?

1887
01:30:12,798 --> 01:30:14,508
I didn't tell him anything.

1888
01:30:14,633 --> 01:30:18,179
Well, for one, he called Gary
a shit-heel!

1889
01:30:18,512 --> 01:30:19,972
And he hasn't slept for four days!

1890
01:30:20,056 --> 01:30:22,266
He keeps talking about tree werewolves.

1891
01:30:22,349 --> 01:30:24,852
Ron, listen to me. He is seven years old.

1892
01:30:24,977 --> 01:30:27,730
You need to learn to connect
with him in a healthy way!

1893
01:30:27,813 --> 01:30:30,983
He has a science fair tomorrow, at 8:00,

1894
01:30:31,317 --> 01:30:32,818
and he wants you to be there.

1895
01:30:32,902 --> 01:30:35,404
I will be there. All right?

1896
01:30:35,609 --> 01:30:37,049
Now, who do you have
for sweeps week?

1897
01:30:37,073 --> 01:30:39,325
I'm not discussing
work with you, Ron, okay?

1898
01:30:39,408 --> 01:30:42,078
Just be there
at the science fair tomorrow.

1899
01:30:42,411 --> 01:30:43,412
Fine!

1900
01:30:44,436 --> 01:30:46,516
<i>Well, they're calling it
the interview of the decade.</i>

1901
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:49,168
<i>Veronica Corningstone will
sit down with Yasser Arafat,</i>

1902
01:30:49,335 --> 01:30:50,836
<i>the head of the PLO and, some say,</i>

1903
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:52,254
<i>the key to peace in the Middle East.</i>

1904
01:30:52,338 --> 01:30:55,674
<i>Of course, Ms. Corningstone is
the ex-wife of Ron Burgundy,</i>

1905
01:30:56,592 --> 01:30:58,793
<i>so you know that's got to be
a little stinger for Ronny.</i>

1906
01:30:58,844 --> 01:31:00,513
Terry Bradshaw's nipple!

1907
01:31:00,805 --> 01:31:03,891
<i>Thank you for watching GNN.
I'm Jack Me-off!</i>

1908
01:31:09,188 --> 01:31:12,233
We're going to get crushed
in ratings. Just crushed.

1909
01:31:12,942 --> 01:31:15,194
I really thought we had
a chance this time.

1910
01:31:15,361 --> 01:31:17,780
What about my
"Death From Above" story?

1911
01:31:18,697 --> 01:31:21,033
You better ask Ron about that.

1912
01:31:22,535 --> 01:31:24,036
We're pulling that story, Brian.

1913
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:26,956
What? Why?
I worked hard on that story.

1914
01:31:27,081 --> 01:31:28,457
It was my call, all right, Brian?

1915
01:31:28,582 --> 01:31:30,292
Just let it go. It's synergy.

1916
01:31:30,626 --> 01:31:31,627
What does that mean?

1917
01:31:31,877 --> 01:31:33,170
Take it easy, Ron.

1918
01:31:33,254 --> 01:31:35,840
We got further than anybody thought
we would. We'll get 'em next time.

1919
01:31:35,923 --> 01:31:37,174
You take it easy!

1920
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:39,093
I'm not in this to finish second!

1921
01:31:39,218 --> 01:31:40,779
I think Champ is just saying that we...

1922
01:31:40,803 --> 01:31:43,973
I know what he was trying
to say, Brian, okay?

1923
01:31:44,306 --> 01:31:46,392
And it doesn't surprise me
that you guys don't care.

1924
01:31:47,059 --> 01:31:49,854
I mean, let's face it.
You'd be nowhere without me.

1925
01:31:50,229 --> 01:31:53,482
<i>I'm the one who got invited
to the set of Urban Cowboy.</i>

1926
01:31:53,732 --> 01:31:55,151
Not you guys!

1927
01:31:55,234 --> 01:31:57,820
I'm the one with the hot black girlfriend.

1928
01:31:57,945 --> 01:32:00,781
I'm the one who gets
his Caesar salad made table-side!

1929
01:32:01,073 --> 01:32:03,325
- That is nice.
- Oh, salad.

1930
01:32:03,576 --> 01:32:05,995
I'm starting to wonder
what you clowns actually do.

1931
01:32:06,328 --> 01:32:09,165
Chani likes clowns.
Except for the scary ones.

1932
01:32:09,331 --> 01:32:10,791
Shut up, Brick!

1933
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,085
Just shut up for once!

1934
01:32:13,794 --> 01:32:16,922
Ron yelled at me.

1935
01:32:17,089 --> 01:32:18,799
You're damn right I yelled at you!

1936
01:32:18,924 --> 01:32:21,135
When you talk nonsense for 15 years,

1937
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:23,762
someone's going to get
just a little bit tired of it!

1938
01:32:26,515 --> 01:32:30,186
You don't yell at Brick.
Are you still smoking crack?

1939
01:32:30,686 --> 01:32:31,854
No.

1940
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:34,315
I only smoked that one time.

1941
01:32:35,107 --> 01:32:38,110
That's a lie. I've done it six more times.

1942
01:32:38,485 --> 01:32:39,820
You made Brick cry.

1943
01:32:41,322 --> 01:32:43,699
You've gone ratings crazy, Ron.

1944
01:32:45,951 --> 01:32:48,495
But, seriously, do you have
any more of that crack left?

1945
01:32:48,621 --> 01:32:50,164
You know what, Ron?

1946
01:32:50,289 --> 01:32:52,583
We're a news team,
and that's a bond for life.

1947
01:32:52,666 --> 01:32:54,585
But I don't like the man you've become.

1948
01:32:54,668 --> 01:32:57,463
You know, we were happy
when you found us. Right?

1949
01:32:57,546 --> 01:32:59,340
I was taking pictures of pussies,

1950
01:32:59,548 --> 01:33:02,176
Champ was serving bats to
people, and Brick was dead.

1951
01:33:02,301 --> 01:33:03,510
We took a gamble.

1952
01:33:03,802 --> 01:33:05,179
Took a gamble to follow you here.

1953
01:33:05,304 --> 01:33:07,344
But I'm starting to realize,
this was all about you,

1954
01:33:07,348 --> 01:33:08,766
and beating Veronica at all costs.

1955
01:33:08,849 --> 01:33:10,249
It had nothing to do with the news,

1956
01:33:10,309 --> 01:33:12,269
- nothing to do with the team.
- Brian, don't.

1957
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:14,104
You know, I might not
be the smartest guy,

1958
01:33:14,188 --> 01:33:16,190
but I know a thing or two
about a thing or two.

1959
01:33:16,482 --> 01:33:18,567
I know that if you're pleasuring
a woman down south,

1960
01:33:18,651 --> 01:33:21,487
you use your tongue to spell
out the alphabet around her...

1961
01:33:22,196 --> 01:33:23,822
The bubble. Around her bubble.

1962
01:33:23,948 --> 01:33:26,242
- The vulva!
- The Volvo.

1963
01:33:26,492 --> 01:33:28,118
I always do the KISS logo

1964
01:33:28,202 --> 01:33:30,329
or the Led Zeppelin "ZoSo" symbols.

1965
01:33:30,663 --> 01:33:32,539
I know the El Camino
is the coolest thing ever

1966
01:33:32,665 --> 01:33:34,333
because it's a car and it's a truck

1967
01:33:34,416 --> 01:33:36,502
and that's just two
different ways to get pussy.

1968
01:33:36,669 --> 01:33:39,088
I can't argue with any of those points.

1969
01:33:39,171 --> 01:33:41,590
And I know that no matter what,

1970
01:33:41,715 --> 01:33:44,718
you always stand by your friends.

1971
01:33:45,094 --> 01:33:46,679
Sorry, Brian.

1972
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:49,598
I've got a sore back.

1973
01:33:49,682 --> 01:33:51,725
You'll have to excuse me.

1974
01:33:52,017 --> 01:33:55,187
It's so sore from carrying your ass
for the last 15 years.

1975
01:33:57,356 --> 01:33:59,858
I think you're sick in the head, Burgundy.

1976
01:34:01,402 --> 01:34:04,280
Thankfully, I've got
a whole spoon full of medicine.

1977
01:34:10,244 --> 01:34:12,246
I don't know who I am.

1978
01:34:12,413 --> 01:34:15,416
Oh, my God! The room is spinning.

1979
01:34:15,708 --> 01:34:17,376
You'll regret this!

1980
01:34:17,543 --> 01:34:20,462
You'll regret this, Brian!

1981
01:34:20,546 --> 01:34:23,716
I can't move my left side of my body.

1982
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:27,303
One, two, three, get up
on the count of three.

1983
01:34:27,511 --> 01:34:28,971
One, two, three.

1984
01:34:34,977 --> 01:34:38,731
<i>Tonight, I interview Yasser Arafat,
the secretive head of the PLO.</i>

1985
01:34:38,814 --> 01:34:41,025
Hey, don't let her
get into your head, Ron.

1986
01:34:41,108 --> 01:34:42,234
I can't believe this.

1987
01:34:42,318 --> 01:34:43,861
How do you even get that guy's number?

1988
01:34:43,944 --> 01:34:46,572
We've got to get someone
from a foreign country.

1989
01:34:46,822 --> 01:34:49,616
Guys, we're on in 20, 20, Ron.

1990
01:34:50,451 --> 01:34:51,869
You ready?

1991
01:34:51,952 --> 01:34:53,704
What's that, huh?

1992
01:34:53,787 --> 01:34:56,165
Oh, that's nothing. It's just a car chase

1993
01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:58,625
on the satellite feed from Milwaukee.

1994
01:34:59,335 --> 01:35:00,961
You know what?

1995
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:03,714
Give it to me live to start the broadcast.

1996
01:35:03,797 --> 01:35:06,508
No. That's not news, Ron.

1997
01:35:06,759 --> 01:35:08,510
Give it to me live, okay?

1998
01:35:08,677 --> 01:35:11,013
- And don't question me again.
- Bill!

1999
01:35:11,096 --> 01:35:14,975
<i>Journalists back in 1980
thought that a car chase wasn't news.</i>

2000
01:35:15,559 --> 01:35:19,605
<i>But Ron Burgundy wasn't a journalist,
he was an anchorman.</i>

2001
01:35:19,772 --> 01:35:21,982
Good evening. I'm Ron Burgundy,

2002
01:35:22,107 --> 01:35:23,817
reporting live from New York.

2003
01:35:24,026 --> 01:35:25,861
We have breaking news developing

2004
01:35:25,944 --> 01:35:27,613
in our nation's heartland.

2005
01:35:27,696 --> 01:35:31,158
A high-speed car chase is in progress...

2006
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:33,345
Keep the "Breaking News" logo up.
Keep up the graphic.

2007
01:35:33,369 --> 01:35:35,037
Reaching speeds of up to 100 mph.

2008
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:37,081
And for the first time in news history,

2009
01:35:37,164 --> 01:35:39,041
we will stay with it live

2010
01:35:39,124 --> 01:35:41,418
<i>until it resolves
in either a huge accident</i>

2011
01:35:41,502 --> 01:35:43,754
<i>or a massive shootout.</i>

2012
01:35:43,837 --> 01:35:47,091
Ron Burgundy is so brave
for covering this.

2013
01:35:47,174 --> 01:35:48,634
What an American!

2014
01:35:49,968 --> 01:35:51,970
Are you worried
your dad's not gonna come?

2015
01:35:52,054 --> 01:35:54,556
He'll be here. He promised he would.

2016
01:35:55,140 --> 01:35:57,017
Does he usually stick to his promises?

2017
01:35:57,476 --> 01:36:00,396
Always. Except not most of the times.

2018
01:36:02,314 --> 01:36:04,191
We're going to stay with this live.

2019
01:36:04,316 --> 01:36:06,777
I know there's other news out there.

2020
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:10,322
There's boring interviews
with weird foreigners

2021
01:36:10,406 --> 01:36:13,200
going on right now
that are not important.

2022
01:36:13,826 --> 01:36:17,871
This is the pulse of what's going on
in our country right now.

2023
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:19,748
Freddie, what's going on?

2024
01:36:19,832 --> 01:36:21,458
Why is there a local car chase
on the TV?

2025
01:36:21,542 --> 01:36:23,043
It's Burgundy, he insisted.

2026
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:25,051
Can't you see what
the son of a bitch is doing?

2027
01:36:25,170 --> 01:36:26,690
He didn't have a story so he made one!

2028
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,215
You can't do that!

2029
01:36:28,674 --> 01:36:30,509
Tell Ron to speculate
who's driving the car.

2030
01:36:30,592 --> 01:36:33,595
Ron, speculate on who's driving the car.

2031
01:36:33,846 --> 01:36:37,558
We believe the driver may be on drugs.

2032
01:36:37,724 --> 01:36:42,771
He's probably 6'7", 6'8", but
a skinny 6'7", 6'8", about 160.

2033
01:36:42,855 --> 01:36:45,190
He may have a hostage or two.

2034
01:36:45,357 --> 01:36:47,526
We don't know.
He could have something in his car.

2035
01:36:47,693 --> 01:36:50,320
The phone lines are lighting up.
It's about the chase!

2036
01:36:50,404 --> 01:36:51,780
I've never seen anything like it!

2037
01:36:52,114 --> 01:36:55,409
Mr. Arafat, is there any scenario

2038
01:36:55,534 --> 01:36:57,786
by which peace could be
reached with Israel?

2039
01:36:57,953 --> 01:37:00,122
Peace is what burns in my heart...

2040
01:37:00,205 --> 01:37:01,248
What was it? Excuse me.

2041
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:03,459
What happened to the...

2042
01:37:03,625 --> 01:37:05,419
The network cut to
another developing story.

2043
01:37:05,544 --> 01:37:07,546
Some kind of crazy car chase.

2044
01:37:07,629 --> 01:37:09,631
Who covers a car chase?

2045
01:37:09,882 --> 01:37:12,259
I'm sitting here with
the most important interview

2046
01:37:12,384 --> 01:37:13,635
of my entire career,

2047
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:15,160
and they're cutting to a car chase?

2048
01:37:15,220 --> 01:37:16,472
<i>This is extremely gripping.</i>

2049
01:37:16,555 --> 01:37:19,224
<i>He just hit a car! He just hit a car!</i>

2050
01:37:19,308 --> 01:37:20,559
He hit a car! Did you see that?

2051
01:37:20,767 --> 01:37:22,394
Oh, they just wrecked!

2052
01:37:22,561 --> 01:37:24,313
- Wow!
- I fucking love the news!

2053
01:37:24,396 --> 01:37:25,481
Yeah!

2054
01:37:25,731 --> 01:37:27,566
Oh, my God, that car
just hit another car.

2055
01:37:27,649 --> 01:37:29,485
This is awesome.

2056
01:37:29,568 --> 01:37:31,570
<i>And he just loses it! Wow!</i>

2057
01:37:31,737 --> 01:37:33,155
That's exactly what we needed.

2058
01:37:33,238 --> 01:37:34,573
It was getting a little boring.

2059
01:37:38,410 --> 01:37:40,412
Hey. You did a great job.

2060
01:37:40,829 --> 01:37:42,498
Thanks, Gary.

2061
01:37:42,831 --> 01:37:44,111
I don't think your dad's coming.

2062
01:37:44,249 --> 01:37:46,084
I'm sorry, honey,
but I think we need to go.

2063
01:37:48,045 --> 01:37:49,880
Stop reading my mind!

2064
01:37:50,756 --> 01:37:51,965
All right.

2065
01:37:55,928 --> 01:37:58,096
I mean, this is what I worry about.

2066
01:37:58,180 --> 01:38:00,349
My dad thinks you're like a wizard.

2067
01:38:00,432 --> 01:38:02,142
I'm a psychologist.

2068
01:38:02,267 --> 01:38:04,144
I have a ponytail, for God's sakes.

2069
01:38:04,353 --> 01:38:05,812
We're just getting word that police

2070
01:38:05,938 --> 01:38:08,315
have finally apprehended the suspect.

2071
01:38:08,690 --> 01:38:11,777
It turns out that
he is an elderly gentleman,

2072
01:38:11,944 --> 01:38:13,445
he's 80 years old,

2073
01:38:13,529 --> 01:38:15,447
and he was simply confused.

2074
01:38:15,948 --> 01:38:17,824
Wow! What an afternoon!

2075
01:38:18,116 --> 01:38:19,785
I'm Ron Burgundy.

2076
01:38:19,868 --> 01:38:22,120
I may not always know the facts

2077
01:38:22,204 --> 01:38:24,665
but I'll always tell you the truth.

2078
01:38:25,165 --> 01:38:26,333
Thank you for watching.

2079
01:38:28,001 --> 01:38:30,003
And we are clear!

2080
01:38:30,128 --> 01:38:31,129
Yes!

2081
01:38:31,630 --> 01:38:32,631
Great!

2082
01:38:32,965 --> 01:38:34,091
All right!

2083
01:38:34,174 --> 01:38:36,301
I don't believe it! You did it, Ron!

2084
01:38:36,385 --> 01:38:38,512
Oh, my goodness. Thanks, Freddie.

2085
01:38:39,846 --> 01:38:41,473
I don't deserve this.

2086
01:38:41,557 --> 01:38:43,559
It was a team effort. it really was.

2087
01:39:00,701 --> 01:39:02,160
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

2088
01:39:02,578 --> 01:39:04,496
<i>we all know there's one reason</i>

2089
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:07,040
<i>that GNN have gotten to the top.</i>

2090
01:39:07,874 --> 01:39:09,293
<i>And that reason is the greatest</i>

2091
01:39:09,376 --> 01:39:10,919
<i>bloody newsman in the world.</i>

2092
01:39:11,003 --> 01:39:12,879
<i>Long may he reign!</i>

2093
01:39:13,171 --> 01:39:14,881
<i>Mr. Ron Burgundy!</i>

2094
01:39:15,173 --> 01:39:16,174
Yeah, Ron!

2095
01:39:16,425 --> 01:39:17,676
Yeah!

2096
01:39:25,559 --> 01:39:27,394
Fire it up, Ronny!

2097
01:39:51,084 --> 01:39:52,419
Let's blaze.

2098
01:39:52,586 --> 01:39:55,088
Yeah. To hell with Ron Burgundy.

2099
01:39:56,256 --> 01:39:58,300
We did it, my onyx hellion.

2100
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:01,720
You're magic!

2101
01:40:06,224 --> 01:40:07,601
Good friend.

2102
01:40:22,742 --> 01:40:24,744
<i>In the myth of Icarus,</i>

2103
01:40:24,952 --> 01:40:27,705
<i>Icarus, full of the folly
that comes with pride,</i>

2104
01:40:27,789 --> 01:40:28,998
<i>flew too high</i>

2105
01:40:29,082 --> 01:40:30,917
<i>and the sun melted his wings.</i>

2106
01:40:32,251 --> 01:40:35,380
<i>Ron had no idea who Icarus was.</i>

2107
01:40:35,546 --> 01:40:38,383
<i>He thought he was an alien villain
from Star Trek.</i>

2108
01:40:46,974 --> 01:40:48,643
Oh, my God, Ronny!

2109
01:40:48,976 --> 01:40:50,144
Ron!

2110
01:40:50,269 --> 01:40:51,354
Open the bloody gate.

2111
01:40:51,437 --> 01:40:52,522
Somebody call an ambulance!

2112
01:40:52,605 --> 01:40:55,858
My heart is split like a melon!

2113
01:40:56,442 --> 01:40:59,278
Do not die in front of us!

2114
01:41:01,364 --> 01:41:03,449
Stay classy, Ron Burgundy.

2115
01:41:16,629 --> 01:41:17,922
Damn it, Milton, what is it?

2116
01:41:18,005 --> 01:41:19,132
Well, Ron...

2117
01:41:19,674 --> 01:41:21,008
L.-

2118
01:41:22,009 --> 01:41:25,471
it looks as if both optic
nerves are separated

2119
01:41:25,555 --> 01:41:27,473
from their respective corneas.

2120
01:41:27,724 --> 01:41:29,726
- What?
- No other way to put this, but...

2121
01:41:30,143 --> 01:41:31,185
You're blind.

2122
01:41:31,519 --> 01:41:35,648
But surely there's some drug
or some machine...

2123
01:41:36,315 --> 01:41:40,069
Ron, I've looked at all
the test results repeatedly.

2124
01:41:40,653 --> 01:41:42,488
There's always false positives.

2125
01:41:42,572 --> 01:41:44,782
- Run the tests again!
- Okay, all right.

2126
01:41:44,866 --> 01:41:46,534
There is one more test I can do.

2127
01:41:46,659 --> 01:41:47,702
I knew it!

2128
01:41:54,041 --> 01:41:55,334
Yep, you're blind!

2129
01:41:56,002 --> 01:41:57,879
Clearly, there must be something in this

2130
01:41:58,004 --> 01:41:59,756
new-fangled office of yours

2131
01:41:59,839 --> 01:42:01,160
- that can help me!
- Settle down.

2132
01:42:01,174 --> 01:42:02,800
There's got to be something in here!

2133
01:42:02,884 --> 01:42:04,343
Orderly. Orderly.

2134
01:42:04,510 --> 01:42:06,262
Zombies! Zombies!

2135
01:42:09,015 --> 01:42:11,684
If you get my hands on me, I'll kill you.

2136
01:42:12,518 --> 01:42:14,061
<i>The world of the blind.</i>

2137
01:42:14,187 --> 01:42:18,065
<i>Ron Burgundy, a man who had
flourished in a visual medium,</i>

2138
01:42:18,191 --> 01:42:21,444
<i>had forever entered
this realm of darkness.</i>

2139
01:42:40,254 --> 01:42:41,297
Who is it?

2140
01:42:44,217 --> 01:42:46,219
Ron, it's us!

2141
01:42:46,427 --> 01:42:49,430
I'm sure you gentlemen
are famished from your travels.

2142
01:42:49,555 --> 01:42:53,059
I hope you like Triscuits
and some pimento loaf.

2143
01:42:53,893 --> 01:42:55,728
Still hot off the griddle!

2144
01:42:56,062 --> 01:42:57,230
There we go.

2145
01:42:57,730 --> 01:42:59,899
Well, everyone at the station
really misses you, Ron.

2146
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:02,300
Jack Lime's been filling in for you

2147
01:43:02,318 --> 01:43:03,903
since you've been gone.

2148
01:43:03,986 --> 01:43:05,986
You know, he's really not
such a bad guy after all.

2149
01:43:07,824 --> 01:43:08,908
Brick!

2150
01:43:09,242 --> 01:43:11,244
That's checkers and caulk.
Don't eat that.

2151
01:43:12,411 --> 01:43:14,080
What about Linda? She hasn't called.

2152
01:43:14,247 --> 01:43:17,124
Linda's pretty busy.
I'm sure that's what it is.

2153
01:43:17,250 --> 01:43:19,252
Have you ever eaten
the boot from Monopoly?

2154
01:43:20,753 --> 01:43:22,463
It is so good.

2155
01:43:22,974 --> 01:43:24,775
So, Ron, what do you do
with yourself all day?

2156
01:43:24,799 --> 01:43:26,592
You're just out here pretty
much away from everything.

2157
01:43:26,676 --> 01:43:28,845
Well, every day begins about the same.

2158
01:43:29,428 --> 01:43:31,305
I wake up screaming in terror

2159
01:43:31,430 --> 01:43:33,307
because of the blackness
and I think I'm dead.

2160
01:43:33,432 --> 01:43:34,517
Every day?

2161
01:43:34,684 --> 01:43:36,185
Yes! Every day!

2162
01:43:36,602 --> 01:43:39,605
And then I begin what's called
The Great Adventure.

2163
01:43:39,772 --> 01:43:41,357
Making breakfast.

2164
01:43:41,774 --> 01:43:44,277
I've eaten everything from
nails to drink coasters.

2165
01:43:44,485 --> 01:43:46,612
Don't even bring up Thanksgiving.

2166
01:43:46,696 --> 01:43:48,781
I got halfway through a Nerf football.

2167
01:43:49,490 --> 01:43:53,619
You haven't been blind
for Thanksgiving.

2168
01:43:53,703 --> 01:43:56,038
You know what the biggest indignity is?

2169
01:43:56,289 --> 01:43:57,665
I can't even masturbate.

2170
01:43:57,790 --> 01:43:59,458
Really?

2171
01:43:59,542 --> 01:44:00,877
What's masturbate?

2172
01:44:01,335 --> 01:44:03,546
Heck, one morning I spent 20 minutes

2173
01:44:03,629 --> 01:44:05,965
aggressively rubbing my shin,

2174
01:44:06,507 --> 01:44:09,760
wondering, "Where's the sensation?
Where's the pleasure coming?"

2175
01:44:09,844 --> 01:44:11,470
Went through half a can of Crisco.

2176
01:44:11,554 --> 01:44:13,472
You rubbed your shin
thinking it was a penis?

2177
01:44:13,556 --> 01:44:16,809
Feel it. Tell me that
doesn't feel like a penis.

2178
01:44:17,310 --> 01:44:18,686
That feels like a shin.

2179
01:44:19,478 --> 01:44:22,356
Yeah, because you're feeling it
through the hands of a sighted person.

2180
01:44:22,481 --> 01:44:25,776
Ron, purely for empirical
evidence and science,

2181
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:28,738
I'd like to feel your bony, hard cock
and compare that to a shin.

2182
01:44:28,905 --> 01:44:30,948
You think I'm stupid, don't you?

2183
01:44:31,032 --> 01:44:32,658
Go ahead, laugh at the blind man.

2184
01:44:32,742 --> 01:44:35,995
Laugh at the village fool.
The carnival freak.

2185
01:44:37,079 --> 01:44:38,915
I'm like the Elephant Man, aren't I?

2186
01:44:38,998 --> 01:44:40,541
Oh, come on, Ron.

2187
01:44:40,666 --> 01:44:43,252
Do I amuse you?

2188
01:44:43,502 --> 01:44:45,129
More!

2189
01:44:45,212 --> 01:44:48,424
I'm a man. I'm not an animal.

2190
01:44:48,716 --> 01:44:49,842
What you're going through

2191
01:44:49,926 --> 01:44:51,510
has nothing to do
with the Elephant Man.

2192
01:44:51,594 --> 01:44:53,137
It doesn't even remotely compare.

2193
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:57,224
Let me say it real slow and real loud.

2194
01:44:57,850 --> 01:44:59,602
I'm

2195
01:44:59,685 --> 01:45:02,396
blind!

2196
01:45:03,522 --> 01:45:04,982
I guess we should get out of here.

2197
01:45:05,066 --> 01:45:06,859
Maybe you should go. Yes.

2198
01:45:06,943 --> 01:45:08,569
Why don't you guys get out of here!

2199
01:45:09,195 --> 01:45:11,572
Despite my complete and utter isolation,

2200
01:45:11,697 --> 01:45:14,909
your gentlemen's visit
has actually made it worse!

2201
01:45:22,416 --> 01:45:23,918
Good-bye, Ron.

2202
01:45:26,128 --> 01:45:27,296
What?

2203
01:45:27,964 --> 01:45:29,298
No, don't go!

2204
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:33,761
Please! Wait! I'm all alone! Come back!

2205
01:45:38,766 --> 01:45:41,435
Wait! Come back!

2206
01:45:42,103 --> 01:45:43,771
Come back!

2207
01:45:47,108 --> 01:45:48,776
I'm alone!

2208
01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:53,781
Why have you done this to me, God?
Why?

2209
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:58,160
You feel like a big shot?
Are you a big man now?

2210
01:45:58,244 --> 01:46:00,496
Are you getting your jollies
off this one, God?

2211
01:46:00,579 --> 01:46:01,956
I hope you're happy.

2212
01:46:03,249 --> 01:46:04,769
Well, I never thought that I would see

2213
01:46:04,792 --> 01:46:08,254
the Ron Burgundy
full of so much self-pity.

2214
01:46:08,421 --> 01:46:11,090
Who is it? What is that noise?

2215
01:46:11,298 --> 01:46:12,425
Take my hand.

2216
01:46:13,134 --> 01:46:14,468
I can't see it!

2217
01:46:14,593 --> 01:46:16,012
Reach for it, Ron!

2218
01:46:16,095 --> 01:46:18,764
You have to learn to do for yourself now.

2219
01:46:19,432 --> 01:46:21,183
All right. This... Okay. Here we go.

2220
01:46:21,267 --> 01:46:22,518
Get up. There we go.

2221
01:46:25,312 --> 01:46:26,647
Cher, is that you?

2222
01:46:26,772 --> 01:46:28,649
You can't recognize me by my voice?

2223
01:46:29,775 --> 01:46:31,777
Billy Dee Williams.

2224
01:46:32,278 --> 01:46:33,320
Really?

2225
01:46:33,821 --> 01:46:36,240
Every news station is copying
what you did, Ron.

2226
01:46:36,323 --> 01:46:41,412
All the stories are about animals,
or car chases or strip clubs.

2227
01:46:41,829 --> 01:46:44,331
The genie has been let out of the bottle,

2228
01:46:44,665 --> 01:46:47,001
and old Ron Burgundy popped the cork.

2229
01:46:47,293 --> 01:46:49,670
<i>- That's why I quit WBC News.
- What?</i>

2230
01:46:49,795 --> 01:46:51,964
There's no real news
being reported out there.

2231
01:46:52,048 --> 01:46:53,507
It's just all about ratings.

2232
01:46:53,799 --> 01:46:55,134
Veronica.

2233
01:46:55,718 --> 01:46:56,886
Why are you here?

2234
01:46:57,136 --> 01:46:58,804
I'm here for our son, Ron.

2235
01:46:59,055 --> 01:47:00,389
Walter needs you.

2236
01:47:00,473 --> 01:47:02,391
I need you to start taking responsibility

2237
01:47:02,475 --> 01:47:04,310
for him and for yourself.

2238
01:47:04,810 --> 01:47:07,605
Do you realize you're talking to a man

2239
01:47:07,688 --> 01:47:10,858
who just this morning tried
to brush his teeth with a...

2240
01:47:10,983 --> 01:47:13,486
With a violin that he found
at a flea market?

2241
01:47:14,236 --> 01:47:16,030
What? How?

2242
01:47:16,691 --> 01:47:19,051
Wouldn't you have known it was
a violin when you touched it?

2243
01:47:19,075 --> 01:47:22,078
I'm just saying,
it's not going to be a cakewalk.

2244
01:47:22,328 --> 01:47:24,538
Well, then we best get to it.

2245
01:47:29,710 --> 01:47:32,254
It's next to impossible. I can't do it!

2246
01:47:38,344 --> 01:47:40,054
Just remember the curves.

2247
01:47:40,262 --> 01:47:41,347
The curves.

2248
01:47:41,430 --> 01:47:43,265
- The green eyes.
- Green eyes.

2249
01:47:43,349 --> 01:47:46,477
Yes, I'm still sitting here nude
like you requested.

2250
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,437
I can't do it!

2251
01:47:49,355 --> 01:47:52,566
Baxter found something on the beach!

2252
01:47:53,109 --> 01:47:54,485
Ron, be careful!

2253
01:47:54,568 --> 01:47:56,612
It's okay!

2254
01:47:56,695 --> 01:47:59,907
- Walter, what is it?
- It's some kind of fish!

2255
01:48:01,742 --> 01:48:04,036
It's not just a fish. It's a shark.

2256
01:48:04,411 --> 01:48:06,705
And by the smell of the oil from its liver,

2257
01:48:06,789 --> 01:48:08,457
it's a juvenile great white.

2258
01:48:08,791 --> 01:48:10,251
Oh, my goodness!

2259
01:48:10,376 --> 01:48:13,712
If he stays tangled in this net,
he's not going to survive.

2260
01:48:13,963 --> 01:48:15,798
Walter, sweetheart, it's a shark.

2261
01:48:16,382 --> 01:48:18,592
It's not just a shark, Veronica,

2262
01:48:18,717 --> 01:48:21,053
<i>he's a Carcharodon carcharias.</i>

2263
01:48:21,137 --> 01:48:23,722
The largest apex predator in the ocean.

2264
01:48:25,391 --> 01:48:26,725
Son,

2265
01:48:27,143 --> 01:48:29,812
don't you worry,
we won't let this fellow die.

2266
01:48:30,229 --> 01:48:32,064
We'll do it together, Dad.

2267
01:48:35,901 --> 01:48:38,237
That should keep him in there
until he's strong enough

2268
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:40,072
to swim out to the deep ocean.

2269
01:48:40,406 --> 01:48:41,574
Can I name him?

2270
01:48:41,657 --> 01:48:43,284
Of course you can, son.

2271
01:48:43,576 --> 01:48:46,287
What about Crackers?

2272
01:48:46,745 --> 01:48:48,706
Give me a goddamn break.

2273
01:48:48,789 --> 01:48:51,792
Seriously, you've got one of
the most vicious predators

2274
01:48:51,917 --> 01:48:54,003
in the ocean and you're
going to name him Crackers?

2275
01:48:54,086 --> 01:48:57,089
In the future, when you say
I can name something,

2276
01:48:57,423 --> 01:48:59,091
don't be a dick about it.

2277
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:01,844
Why don't we do this?
Let's name him Doby.

2278
01:49:02,094 --> 01:49:03,637
All right, I can live with that.

2279
01:49:06,015 --> 01:49:09,435
Don't worry, Baxter, we won't
feed him your dog food.

2280
01:49:15,774 --> 01:49:18,444
<i>Even though Ron Burgundy
had lost his sight,</i>

2281
01:49:18,527 --> 01:49:20,779
<i>he had never seen so clearly.</i>

2282
01:49:20,946 --> 01:49:23,866
<i>He had the love of Veronica
and his son.</i>

2283
01:49:23,949 --> 01:49:25,618
<i>The beauty of the lighthouse.</i>

2284
01:49:25,701 --> 01:49:30,039
<i>And with every inch Doby grew,
so did Ron's heart.</i>

2285
01:49:30,331 --> 01:49:32,333
Well, you're a hungry guy.

2286
01:49:34,543 --> 01:49:36,295
Got you!

2287
01:49:39,173 --> 01:49:40,633
- Yes!
- You got it.

2288
01:49:40,716 --> 01:49:42,968
You struck him out.

2289
01:49:44,970 --> 01:49:47,014
Happy birthday, Doby!

2290
01:49:47,348 --> 01:49:48,849
Ron, Walter.

2291
01:49:49,892 --> 01:49:52,770
Mom, we made a birthday cake for Doby

2292
01:49:52,853 --> 01:49:55,522
out of seal meat and chum icing.

2293
01:49:55,648 --> 01:49:57,441
- We did.
- Nice, nice.

2294
01:49:57,524 --> 01:50:00,402
Listen, I... Walter, I fear that the shark

2295
01:50:00,486 --> 01:50:02,738
is getting too big for the cove now.

2296
01:50:03,322 --> 01:50:05,157
What do you know, bitch!

2297
01:50:05,241 --> 01:50:06,575
Excuse me, young man.

2298
01:50:06,659 --> 01:50:10,329
Walter, that language
is only used by your father

2299
01:50:10,412 --> 01:50:12,206
when your mother messes up.

2300
01:50:12,331 --> 01:50:13,916
She ruins everything!

2301
01:50:13,999 --> 01:50:17,544
First she made you leave
and now she wants Doby to go.

2302
01:50:17,670 --> 01:50:19,630
It might be time to set Doby free.

2303
01:50:19,713 --> 01:50:23,092
The other day we found old man
Crowley's walker by the cove.

2304
01:50:23,175 --> 01:50:24,468
He's been missing for a week.

2305
01:50:24,551 --> 01:50:25,844
Oh, dear Lord.

2306
01:50:26,011 --> 01:50:28,180
<i>- I'll go talk to him.
- All right.</i>

2307
01:50:29,848 --> 01:50:31,183
Wrong way.

2308
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:38,065
<i>Just like the passing of the seasons,</i>

2309
01:50:38,190 --> 01:50:40,359
<i>it came time for Doby to return</i>

2310
01:50:40,442 --> 01:50:43,070
<i>to the deep waters
he was meant to call home.</i>

2311
01:50:45,281 --> 01:50:47,241
I hear his tail splashing!

2312
01:50:47,366 --> 01:50:49,326
He's actually swimming away!

2313
01:50:49,410 --> 01:50:50,703
Do you think he's crying,

2314
01:50:50,786 --> 01:50:53,372
weeping violently
in the depths of the sea?

2315
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:56,292
He's a shark, so, no.

2316
01:50:56,375 --> 01:50:58,794
I think that he's surrounded by water.

2317
01:50:58,877 --> 01:51:00,462
If we ever see him again,

2318
01:51:00,546 --> 01:51:02,298
do you think he'll remember us?

2319
01:51:02,381 --> 01:51:04,216
Absolutely, my son.

2320
01:51:04,633 --> 01:51:07,261
Sharks are known
for their photographic memory.

2321
01:51:07,469 --> 01:51:09,972
Promise you'll always
be there for me, Dad?

2322
01:51:10,222 --> 01:51:11,640
I promise.

2323
01:51:11,890 --> 01:51:13,809
If I say I'll be there for you,

2324
01:51:13,892 --> 01:51:16,395
there's nothing on God's Earth
that will stop me.

2325
01:51:16,562 --> 01:51:18,063
I love you, Dad.

2326
01:51:18,230 --> 01:51:20,441
Let's get back up to
the lighthouse, all right?

2327
01:51:20,566 --> 01:51:21,650
- Come on.
- Okay.

2328
01:51:24,737 --> 01:51:26,530
Doby, I hope you're happy-

2329
01:51:26,613 --> 01:51:29,783
And I hope you eat
lots of fish and surfers.

2330
01:51:36,332 --> 01:51:37,750
Oh, there you are.

2331
01:51:37,833 --> 01:51:41,045
I found the most beautiful clams
down by the estuary.

2332
01:51:41,128 --> 01:51:43,005
I thought we could
steam them up tonight

2333
01:51:43,088 --> 01:51:44,923
with a nice butter sauce

2334
01:51:45,007 --> 01:51:47,009
and some wine.

2335
01:51:48,844 --> 01:51:50,095
Veronica.

2336
01:51:50,179 --> 01:51:51,847
Yes, Ron?

2337
01:51:52,431 --> 01:51:54,099
Can you explain this?

2338
01:51:57,019 --> 01:52:00,022
<i>Ron, this is Dr. Brangley.
I've left dozens of messages.</i>

2339
01:52:00,272 --> 01:52:01,752
<i>Somehow, they must be getting erased.</i>

2340
01:52:01,940 --> 01:52:04,109
<i>But there is a procedure</i>

2341
01:52:04,193 --> 01:52:06,528
<i>that can possibly return your sight.</i>

2342
01:52:06,779 --> 01:52:08,781
<i>Please get back to me
if you're interested.</i>

2343
01:52:09,948 --> 01:52:12,868
Well? Have you been
erasing these messages?

2344
01:52:13,118 --> 01:52:15,788
Yes. Ron, just let me explain.

2345
01:52:15,871 --> 01:52:16,955
How could you?

2346
01:52:17,122 --> 01:52:18,483
We've never been this happy and...

2347
01:52:18,624 --> 01:52:20,459
Damn you, woman!

2348
01:52:21,710 --> 01:52:23,379
You lied to me!

2349
01:52:24,380 --> 01:52:26,006
I gave you everything!

2350
01:52:26,173 --> 01:52:28,050
I gave you my heart,

2351
01:52:28,384 --> 01:52:30,052
my smile,

2352
01:52:30,386 --> 01:52:31,887
my seed.

2353
01:52:32,221 --> 01:52:33,597
And you lied to me.

2354
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:35,182
- Dad!
- Sweetheart.

2355
01:52:35,307 --> 01:52:36,642
No! Dad!

2356
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:38,519
Don't leave, Dad!

2357
01:52:39,144 --> 01:52:40,479
Dad!

2358
01:52:40,979 --> 01:52:42,606
Sweetheart, we have to let him go.

2359
01:52:42,689 --> 01:52:44,858
He needs to go free.

2360
01:52:46,068 --> 01:52:47,736
Just like Doby.

2361
01:52:47,986 --> 01:52:49,988
He'll be back. He promised.

2362
01:52:51,824 --> 01:52:54,993
Could you please call me
a damn cab? I'm blind!

2363
01:52:55,244 --> 01:52:56,245
Of course!

2364
01:52:57,287 --> 01:53:00,457
<i>Ron, the operation was a success.</i>

2365
01:53:00,791 --> 01:53:04,294
But we won't know for sure
until we remove the bandages.

2366
01:53:10,134 --> 01:53:11,385
Well?

2367
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:13,095
Yes.

2368
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:15,305
I can see.

2369
01:53:19,017 --> 01:53:22,271
Oh, God, oh, God.
It's Ron Burgundy, everyone!

2370
01:53:22,604 --> 01:53:24,189
You are my inspiration.

2371
01:53:24,314 --> 01:53:25,983
Oh, well, thank you.

2372
01:53:27,109 --> 01:53:29,194
Oh, hey, good for you, Ron. Whammy.

2373
01:53:29,403 --> 01:53:30,654
Champ.

2374
01:53:30,988 --> 01:53:32,656
Ron, you grew a mustache.

2375
01:53:32,739 --> 01:53:34,283
Brick.

2376
01:53:34,741 --> 01:53:35,993
Brick and I are having a baby!

2377
01:53:36,076 --> 01:53:37,327
We're gonna name it Sugar.

2378
01:53:37,411 --> 01:53:38,787
- I'm 22 months pregnant.
- All right.

2379
01:53:38,871 --> 01:53:40,080
Well, get over here, you bastard.

2380
01:53:40,164 --> 01:53:41,582
Got you a drink, Ron. Come on.

2381
01:53:41,707 --> 01:53:45,836
Hold on to that drink.
I just want to grab some air.

2382
01:53:57,931 --> 01:53:59,600
How you doing there?

2383
01:54:01,602 --> 01:54:04,229
I'm fine. Just...

2384
01:54:05,230 --> 01:54:06,899
Just a lot of people in there.

2385
01:54:07,024 --> 01:54:10,861
Listen, Ron, I'm sorry that
I never called or visited.

2386
01:54:11,236 --> 01:54:13,238
There's... There's no need to explain.

2387
01:54:13,322 --> 01:54:14,656
But, listen, I mean, you're back.

2388
01:54:14,740 --> 01:54:15,782
Hello, Ron.

2389
01:54:17,117 --> 01:54:18,494
What are you doing here?

2390
01:54:18,577 --> 01:54:21,914
I had to come tell you
something very important.

2391
01:54:23,707 --> 01:54:25,125
You must be Linda Jackson.

2392
01:54:25,209 --> 01:54:26,668
You must be Veronica.

2393
01:54:26,752 --> 01:54:28,337
Yes, I am. It's a pleasure.

2394
01:54:28,670 --> 01:54:30,172
This is a touching moment for me.

2395
01:54:30,255 --> 01:54:32,216
Please, don't take this the wrong way,

2396
01:54:32,382 --> 01:54:34,468
but if you touch Ron again,

2397
01:54:34,551 --> 01:54:36,595
I will pop up from
the backseat of your car

2398
01:54:36,678 --> 01:54:38,722
and burn your face with a curling iron.

2399
01:54:38,805 --> 01:54:40,849
That's all fine and good

2400
01:54:40,933 --> 01:54:43,477
but if you did that I'd be forced

2401
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:45,812
to put your hand in a paper shredder

2402
01:54:45,896 --> 01:54:47,606
while I smoke a cigarette.

2403
01:54:47,731 --> 01:54:50,484
Well, in that case,
I would have no choice

2404
01:54:50,567 --> 01:54:52,653
but to mail your severed foot
to your grandmother.

2405
01:54:52,736 --> 01:54:54,488
Merry Christmas, Nana.

2406
01:54:54,571 --> 01:54:56,198
I was feeling a little bit down

2407
01:54:56,281 --> 01:54:58,158
but this is definitely
picking up my mood.

2408
01:54:58,450 --> 01:55:00,786
Well, I guess I'll leave you two alone

2409
01:55:00,911 --> 01:55:03,747
and it's been an absolute
pleasure, Ms. Corningstone.

2410
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:05,707
This has been great.

2411
01:55:05,791 --> 01:55:07,376
Bye, Linda.

2412
01:55:08,126 --> 01:55:10,212
I know why you haven't
been returning my messages.

2413
01:55:10,295 --> 01:55:11,838
I wasn't calling for me, I was calling

2414
01:55:12,005 --> 01:55:15,175
because Walter has
a piano recital in half an hour

2415
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:17,469
at the Tishman School on 65th Street.

2416
01:55:17,803 --> 01:55:20,097
And he wrote a piece for you, Ron.

2417
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:22,057
Walter.

2418
01:55:22,140 --> 01:55:25,185
It would mean the absolute world
to him to have you there.

2419
01:55:25,310 --> 01:55:27,187
Ron, I just got a call from
the control room!

2420
01:55:27,312 --> 01:55:29,022
Oh, big fan. Oh, Ron...

2421
01:55:29,147 --> 01:55:33,235
Actress Sheila Blackledge,
the mom from the hit sitcom

2422
01:55:33,318 --> 01:55:34,820
<i>Four's a Family, Five's a Crowd...</i>

2423
01:55:34,945 --> 01:55:36,488
<i>Oh, sure.
Four's a family</i>

2424
01:55:36,655 --> 01:55:37,656
<i>Five's a crowd</i>

2425
01:55:38,031 --> 01:55:40,242
<i>The neighbors get mad
'Cause the family's so loud</i>

2426
01:55:40,617 --> 01:55:42,536
It's so funny.

2427
01:55:42,661 --> 01:55:43,745
That's it.

2428
01:55:43,829 --> 01:55:45,872
She found out that her husband
was cheating on her

2429
01:55:46,206 --> 01:55:49,001
and she severed his penis
while he slept!

2430
01:55:49,167 --> 01:55:50,335
Oh, my goodness.

2431
01:55:50,502 --> 01:55:53,672
The police arrived.
She fled in her white Bronco,

2432
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:57,509
and now they're engaged
in a high-speed car chase!

2433
01:55:57,634 --> 01:55:59,636
We've got an exclusive on the live feed,

2434
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:01,763
but we've got to go, right now!

2435
01:56:01,847 --> 01:56:04,808
Ron, this can be your comeback.

2436
01:56:05,517 --> 01:56:07,144
- Veronica, I...
- No, Ron. No.

2437
01:56:07,227 --> 01:56:09,855
That... That will get sky-high ratings.

2438
01:56:11,023 --> 01:56:14,026
- Walter will understand.
- Walter will understand.

2439
01:56:14,401 --> 01:56:15,527
Go.

2440
01:56:16,194 --> 01:56:17,904
Come on, Ron. Priorities!

2441
01:56:18,030 --> 01:56:20,032
- Veronica!
- Come on!

2442
01:56:22,034 --> 01:56:23,076
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

2443
01:56:23,201 --> 01:56:25,078
Yes, yes, you're coming in
loud and clear.

2444
01:56:25,245 --> 01:56:26,645
You're back and you get this story.

2445
01:56:26,830 --> 01:56:28,498
- This is gonna be huge.
- Right.

2446
01:56:28,582 --> 01:56:30,167
<i>God, look at him.</i>

2447
01:56:30,250 --> 01:56:32,002
<i>Like a beacon in the night!</i>

2448
01:56:32,085 --> 01:56:34,296
<i>- My golden goose.
- All right, baby.</i>

2449
01:56:34,387 --> 01:56:36,107
So I'm just gonna be
giving you the details.

2450
01:56:36,131 --> 01:56:37,591
Five, four,

2451
01:56:37,758 --> 01:56:40,385
three, two...

2452
01:56:40,510 --> 01:56:43,555
Good evening, America.
After some time off,

2453
01:56:44,056 --> 01:56:47,392
it's good to be back with you.
I'm Ron Burgundy.

2454
01:56:47,559 --> 01:56:50,646
We have a story tonight
involving an affair,

2455
01:56:51,188 --> 01:56:54,358
a cut-off penis, a TV star,

2456
01:56:54,650 --> 01:56:59,237
twelve kilos of cocaine,
devil worship, and a car chase.

2457
01:56:59,321 --> 01:57:00,572
And throw it to the feed.

2458
01:57:02,658 --> 01:57:04,159
The only problem is...

2459
01:57:05,661 --> 01:57:07,579
- What's he doing?
- Ron, are you okay?

2460
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:09,706
- It's not news.
- What?

2461
01:57:09,831 --> 01:57:12,000
<i>- Turn off the prompter.
- Ron, this is Kench.</i>

2462
01:57:12,084 --> 01:57:13,502
<i>What the hell do you think
you're doing, mate?</i>

2463
01:57:13,585 --> 01:57:15,087
Just read what's in front of you,

2464
01:57:15,212 --> 01:57:17,381
<i>or I will ruin you! Don't!</i>

2465
01:57:17,673 --> 01:57:19,925
Don't! You leave Kench
inside your head!

2466
01:57:20,425 --> 01:57:22,427
God damn it!

2467
01:57:22,678 --> 01:57:25,764
You see, folks, I've read
a lot of news in my day,

2468
01:57:25,931 --> 01:57:29,184
but it's taken me until now

2469
01:57:29,601 --> 01:57:32,104
to realize what real news is.

2470
01:57:32,229 --> 01:57:34,690
Real news is supposed
to let people know

2471
01:57:34,773 --> 01:57:36,274
what the powerful are up to,

2472
01:57:36,358 --> 01:57:39,236
so that that power
doesn't become corrupt.

2473
01:57:39,403 --> 01:57:42,197
But what happens when
the powerful own the news?

2474
01:57:44,533 --> 01:57:47,703
Recently, I've been on a bit
of a personal journey.

2475
01:57:47,786 --> 01:57:51,289
I made love to a proud,
intelligent black woman.

2476
01:57:53,125 --> 01:57:55,127
I became blind.

2477
01:57:55,210 --> 01:57:57,713
I bottle-fed and raised a shark.

2478
01:57:58,046 --> 01:58:00,882
And I smoked a fair amount of crack.

2479
01:58:01,091 --> 01:58:03,427
But the most important thing
I've learned is that

2480
01:58:03,802 --> 01:58:05,804
there was an emptiness left

2481
01:58:06,221 --> 01:58:07,556
after turning my back on three

2482
01:58:07,639 --> 01:58:09,975
of the best friends
anyone could ever ask for.

2483
01:58:10,308 --> 01:58:11,560
Hi, Ron!

2484
01:58:11,643 --> 01:58:13,562
So, if you'll excuse me,

2485
01:58:13,645 --> 01:58:16,106
I'm going to see my child's recital

2486
01:58:16,815 --> 01:58:20,152
and tell the woman I love
that I still love her.

2487
01:58:20,944 --> 01:58:24,281
Good night, America, and never forget,

2488
01:58:24,948 --> 01:58:26,241
you deserve the truth.

2489
01:58:30,412 --> 01:58:32,247
Good. He's dead, done. Linda,

2490
01:58:32,456 --> 01:58:34,082
<i>get the skirt in, the blonde. Anyone!</i>

2491
01:58:34,166 --> 01:58:35,667
He's coming back!

2492
01:58:35,751 --> 01:58:38,670
Also, I just wanted to say
a quick hello to Baxter.

2493
01:58:39,337 --> 01:58:41,006
Hello, Baxter.

2494
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:44,176
We've got dead air.

2495
01:58:44,301 --> 01:58:46,011
Yes, yes, yes.

2496
01:58:46,094 --> 01:58:47,455
We're taking care of it right now.

2497
01:58:50,766 --> 01:58:51,767
Guys, I'm sorry.

2498
01:58:52,100 --> 01:58:53,185
For a while there,

2499
01:58:53,310 --> 01:58:55,312
I don't know
what became of Ron Burgundy.

2500
01:58:55,479 --> 01:58:58,523
Brick, I'm sorry I yelled at you.

2501
01:58:58,940 --> 01:59:00,108
Brian, I...

2502
01:59:00,275 --> 01:59:02,694
No reason why I killed
that story of yours.

2503
01:59:02,778 --> 01:59:04,279
It was excellent reporting.

2504
01:59:04,362 --> 01:59:07,240
And, Champ, I'm really sorry for...

2505
01:59:09,451 --> 01:59:14,956
Actually, I wasn't gonna
apologize for anything to you.

2506
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:16,541
You've done horrible things to me.

2507
01:59:17,042 --> 01:59:18,627
Ron, you're a good man

2508
01:59:18,710 --> 01:59:20,712
but you've fallen victim to your own ego

2509
01:59:20,796 --> 01:59:22,464
and your own hubris.

2510
01:59:22,547 --> 01:59:26,343
And before others can forgive you,
you must learn to forgive yourself.

2511
01:59:29,513 --> 01:59:30,680
What was that, Brick?

2512
01:59:31,056 --> 01:59:33,225
I have a hot dog in my desk.

2513
01:59:33,850 --> 01:59:35,060
Thank you.

2514
01:59:35,227 --> 01:59:37,813
So that's it, huh? You're sorry.

2515
01:59:38,980 --> 01:59:41,733
You know what, Burgundy,
apologies are like assholes.

2516
01:59:42,234 --> 01:59:44,820
Everyone's got one
and everyone's got a shoebox

2517
01:59:44,903 --> 01:59:46,696
full of Polaroids of them under the bed.

2518
01:59:47,489 --> 01:59:49,074
I don't know what that means.

2519
01:59:49,199 --> 01:59:51,493
It means that apologies are cheap

2520
01:59:52,661 --> 01:59:57,082
and that I have a shoebox full
of Polaroids of butt holes

2521
01:59:57,165 --> 01:59:58,708
and I keep it under my bed.

2522
01:59:59,084 --> 02:00:01,545
Maybe one day you'll...

2523
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:06,341
You'll think enough of me
to let me buy you a beer

2524
02:00:06,424 --> 02:00:08,552
and we can look
at that shoebox together.

2525
02:00:08,760 --> 02:00:10,595
Don't hold your breath.

2526
02:00:10,679 --> 02:00:14,516
I only show that shoebox to
my good friends and hitchhikers.

2527
02:00:14,599 --> 02:00:16,434
- I understand.
- Ron...

2528
02:00:16,518 --> 02:00:19,938
We're the news team. This can't end.

2529
02:00:20,438 --> 02:00:24,943
Well, we'll see how this one
does at the box office.

2530
02:00:25,443 --> 02:00:26,987
What?

2531
02:00:27,445 --> 02:00:29,030
Just let him go, Champ.

2532
02:00:33,910 --> 02:00:35,287
Ron!

2533
02:00:37,747 --> 02:00:41,751
Long live Ron Burgundy!

2534
02:00:44,296 --> 02:00:46,464
Guys, he's gonna come to my recital.

2535
02:00:48,967 --> 02:00:50,552
Taxi!

2536
02:00:50,635 --> 02:00:52,596
Taxi! Taxi!

2537
02:00:52,929 --> 02:00:53,930
Damn it!

2538
02:00:54,097 --> 02:00:57,726
It's so hard for a rich white man
to get a taxi in this city!

2539
02:00:58,643 --> 02:01:01,313
- Thank you.
- Ls Dad going to come?

2540
02:01:01,646 --> 02:01:03,815
No, sweetheart, Daddy has to work.

2541
02:01:03,899 --> 02:01:06,067
He's going to come. I know it.

2542
02:01:06,818 --> 02:01:08,236
Taxi!

2543
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:09,988
I need to see my son!

2544
02:01:10,113 --> 02:01:12,490
And now, to play an original composition

2545
02:01:12,574 --> 02:01:14,409
that he wrote for his father,

2546
02:01:14,492 --> 02:01:17,495
here is seven-year-old Walter Burgundy.

2547
02:01:25,837 --> 02:01:28,590
I made a promise!
I made a promise to my son!

2548
02:01:32,177 --> 02:01:33,345
What the hell?

2549
02:01:33,678 --> 02:01:35,263
Well, hello, Ron.

2550
02:01:35,764 --> 02:01:37,098
You out for a jog?

2551
02:01:37,182 --> 02:01:38,516
Jack Lime!

2552
02:01:39,684 --> 02:01:41,019
Where's everyone going?

2553
02:01:41,102 --> 02:01:42,938
Please. I don't have time to talk, okay?

2554
02:01:43,021 --> 02:01:44,314
I have to be somewhere.

2555
02:01:44,439 --> 02:01:47,025
Well, that's funny.
'Cause I got nowhere to be

2556
02:01:47,150 --> 02:01:49,861
'cause you pretty much
destroyed my career.

2557
02:01:49,945 --> 02:01:51,446
Do you realize what it did to me,

2558
02:01:51,529 --> 02:01:53,365
by making me call myself Jack Lame?

2559
02:01:54,199 --> 02:01:56,534
It was a living hell!

2560
02:01:56,952 --> 02:01:58,954
I had to get a new driver's license.

2561
02:01:59,037 --> 02:02:01,289
I can't get restaurant reservations!

2562
02:02:02,874 --> 02:02:04,209
I have to do my own hair.

2563
02:02:04,376 --> 02:02:07,545
Look, I'm sorry but I'm out
of the news game.

2564
02:02:07,671 --> 02:02:08,964
I just walked away.

2565
02:02:09,047 --> 02:02:11,383
You can't just walk away from the news.

2566
02:02:11,633 --> 02:02:14,302
It's like a... It's like
a frat or KISS Army.

2567
02:02:14,386 --> 02:02:15,845
You're in it for life.

2568
02:02:15,971 --> 02:02:18,807
I'm telling you, you have to let me go!

2569
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:21,142
Oh, don't worry. Four against one.

2570
02:02:21,226 --> 02:02:22,644
This will be over fast.

2571
02:02:23,770 --> 02:02:25,271
Maybe not so fast!

2572
02:02:29,067 --> 02:02:31,319
My news team. Thank God!

2573
02:02:33,071 --> 02:02:37,450
Ain't a day that will be or has been
that we don't have Ron Burgundy's back.

2574
02:02:37,826 --> 02:02:39,911
Not a problem. When I'm done
with these mutts,

2575
02:02:40,036 --> 02:02:41,579
I'm gonna wipe my shoes on the curb.

2576
02:02:41,663 --> 02:02:43,498
Oh, yeah, Jack Lime?

2577
02:02:43,581 --> 02:02:45,166
When I'm done with you,

2578
02:02:45,250 --> 02:02:47,752
I hope we can be friends in the future

2579
02:02:47,836 --> 02:02:49,587
and maybe see a movie together.

2580
02:02:49,754 --> 02:02:51,089
Wait!

2581
02:02:54,426 --> 02:02:57,512
It's too bad you don't have
free health care

2582
02:02:57,595 --> 02:03:00,098
because the BBC World Service

2583
02:03:00,181 --> 02:03:02,851
is about to beat your arses bloody!

2584
02:03:04,310 --> 02:03:06,312
God save the Queen

2585
02:03:06,396 --> 02:03:09,441
and God kill Ron Burgundy!

2586
02:03:11,443 --> 02:03:12,944
No. Not now.

2587
02:03:13,069 --> 02:03:14,446
Fall back, fall back.

2588
02:03:18,450 --> 02:03:19,701
If y'all are gonna get down,

2589
02:03:19,784 --> 02:03:22,912
then Wesley Jackson and
the MTV VJ News crew need in!

2590
02:03:23,288 --> 02:03:25,123
What the hell's a VJ?

2591
02:03:26,041 --> 02:03:27,751
I don't know.

2592
02:03:28,126 --> 02:03:30,045
Is that like a vlow job?

2593
02:03:30,962 --> 02:03:32,380
It's the future, sucker!

2594
02:03:32,464 --> 02:03:34,132
We gonna play all videos

2595
02:03:34,257 --> 02:03:36,885
and then eventually just reality shows!

2596
02:03:40,430 --> 02:03:42,390
It wouldn't be a battle
without Jill Janson.

2597
02:03:42,474 --> 02:03:45,060
<i>And Wendy Van Peele
from Entertainment News.</i>

2598
02:03:45,143 --> 02:03:47,812
Entertainment and news,
that's a contradiction.

2599
02:03:47,937 --> 02:03:50,065
In celebrity gossip,
guess who was seen canoodling

2600
02:03:50,148 --> 02:03:51,483
with death at Spago?

2601
02:03:51,608 --> 02:03:52,817
Ron Burgundy!

2602
02:03:52,942 --> 02:03:54,235
Tonight's top story,

2603
02:03:54,319 --> 02:03:56,112
an exclusive interview with Jamie Farr

2604
02:03:56,321 --> 02:03:58,239
plus a couple of douche bag anchormen

2605
02:03:58,323 --> 02:04:00,617
get their balls stomped!

2606
02:04:00,825 --> 02:04:02,327
Hey!

2607
02:04:02,994 --> 02:04:05,997
There's not gonna be any fight
without Scott Riles

2608
02:04:06,122 --> 02:04:08,792
and the incredibly polite
Canadian news team.

2609
02:04:10,335 --> 02:04:12,921
What about the French-speaking
Quebec News?

2610
02:04:13,004 --> 02:04:14,339
The real voice of Canada!

2611
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:15,465
Give it a rest, eh?

2612
02:04:15,673 --> 02:04:18,343
Give me a break! They can't have news.

2613
02:04:18,426 --> 02:04:19,844
Nothing happens in Canada!

2614
02:04:20,011 --> 02:04:21,679
That's not true!

2615
02:04:21,763 --> 02:04:23,765
Sometimes people's feelings get hurt.

2616
02:04:23,848 --> 02:04:25,433
And sometimes the lake freezes.

2617
02:04:25,850 --> 02:04:27,519
I like your ginger ale!

2618
02:04:31,773 --> 02:04:34,776
This is Jeff Bullington, ESPN. All sports.

2619
02:04:34,859 --> 02:04:39,280
That's 24 hours of sports,
but today it's 23

2620
02:04:39,364 --> 02:04:40,949
'cause one of those hours is me

2621
02:04:41,032 --> 02:04:43,201
rectally extracting your spine.

2622
02:04:43,368 --> 02:04:45,370
Twenty-four hours of sports?

2623
02:04:45,495 --> 02:04:47,122
That actually sounds pretty good to me.

2624
02:04:47,205 --> 02:04:48,373
I'd watch that.

2625
02:04:48,748 --> 02:04:52,127
Hey. The History Network wants
in on this. We're news, too.

2626
02:04:52,210 --> 02:04:55,130
Only news told much, much later.

2627
02:04:56,464 --> 02:04:58,216
Wait a minute. Is that the ghost

2628
02:04:58,299 --> 02:04:59,884
of Stonewall Jackson with you?

2629
02:04:59,968 --> 02:05:02,512
Yes, it is. And the mighty Minotaur.

2630
02:05:03,888 --> 02:05:05,974
The Minotaur isn't even history!

2631
02:05:06,057 --> 02:05:08,518
He's mythology! You're crossing
a lot of formats here.

2632
02:05:10,562 --> 02:05:12,564
Hey, let's not downplay the fact that

2633
02:05:12,689 --> 02:05:15,066
that's the ghost of Stonewall Jackson!

2634
02:05:15,150 --> 02:05:19,404
May the Lord anoint
this hallowed field of battle.

2635
02:05:19,571 --> 02:05:22,991
You guys got room in this battle
for an old war horse?

2636
02:05:23,074 --> 02:05:25,076
Mack Tannen!
What are you doing here?

2637
02:05:25,201 --> 02:05:26,411
You're too old for this.

2638
02:05:26,536 --> 02:05:28,746
I had a crush on him
when I was a schoolgirl.

2639
02:05:28,830 --> 02:05:31,833
You like it wrinkled, huh?

2640
02:05:32,041 --> 02:05:34,252
Well, you see, there's the thing.

2641
02:05:34,335 --> 02:05:36,504
When there's an early moon,

2642
02:05:37,422 --> 02:05:40,258
I almost feel like a stallion again!

2643
02:05:40,508 --> 02:05:42,093
He's on our side, right, Ron?

2644
02:05:50,226 --> 02:05:51,686
He's a were-hyena!

2645
02:05:53,771 --> 02:05:55,607
Oh, my God, don't chase us!

2646
02:05:58,526 --> 02:06:00,778
All right, everyone, listen up!

2647
02:06:04,282 --> 02:06:07,452
By virtue of being on this battlefield,

2648
02:06:07,702 --> 02:06:09,537
there is no return.

2649
02:06:10,538 --> 02:06:12,123
People will die.

2650
02:06:12,290 --> 02:06:14,959
Hey, everyone,
if I happen to kill you today...

2651
02:06:15,043 --> 02:06:16,586
Sorry.

2652
02:06:16,794 --> 02:06:19,964
I would be remiss if I did not
mention one last thing...

2653
02:06:20,089 --> 02:06:22,383
Today's blood soaked battle

2654
02:06:22,467 --> 02:06:24,928
will be sponsored by R.C. Cola,

2655
02:06:25,470 --> 02:06:27,472
a delicious beverage

2656
02:06:27,597 --> 02:06:29,974
when you're about
to behead a colleague.

2657
02:06:30,642 --> 02:06:35,063
And as usual, no touching
of the hair and face!

2658
02:06:35,146 --> 02:06:37,315
Yeah, that's... I can go with that one.

2659
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:38,816
I wouldn't appreciate it.

2660
02:06:38,942 --> 02:06:40,902
When El Trousias,

2661
02:06:40,985 --> 02:06:44,113
maiden of the clouds,
blows the battle horn,

2662
02:06:44,781 --> 02:06:46,950
let the battle begin!

2663
02:06:47,075 --> 02:06:49,327
I am El Trousias!

2664
02:06:51,329 --> 02:06:53,998
Hear my siren song!

2665
02:06:55,875 --> 02:06:56,960
She's pretty.

2666
02:06:57,043 --> 02:06:58,670
- Yeah, she has a nice figure.
- I'm not jealous of her.

2667
02:06:58,753 --> 02:06:59,796
No.

2668
02:07:00,505 --> 02:07:02,131
Banged her.

2669
02:07:07,512 --> 02:07:09,347
That means you can start.

2670
02:07:10,014 --> 02:07:12,642
Man, that's like from
a Kajagoogoo video.

2671
02:07:14,018 --> 02:07:16,354
Brick, what the hell is that?

2672
02:07:16,521 --> 02:07:18,273
It's a gun from the future.

2673
02:07:18,356 --> 02:07:20,024
Where did you get it from?

2674
02:07:41,671 --> 02:07:42,797
Huzzah!

2675
02:08:16,080 --> 02:08:18,124
An eye for an eye, I guess I owe you.

2676
02:08:19,334 --> 02:08:21,336
Oh, I'd love to meet Shelly Hack.
Terrific.

2677
02:08:23,129 --> 02:08:26,758
Cowboys don't have throwing stars.

2678
02:08:26,841 --> 02:08:29,302
Man, Burgundy, you're strong as shit.

2679
02:08:29,385 --> 02:08:31,054
I drink Ovaltine for breakfast.

2680
02:08:31,471 --> 02:08:33,389
Son, how's my hair?

2681
02:08:33,931 --> 02:08:34,932
Thanks.

2682
02:08:42,523 --> 02:08:45,319
Fill that gap. Fall upon your swords.

2683
02:08:45,569 --> 02:08:47,071
Life has no meaning.

2684
02:08:50,407 --> 02:08:51,742
There will be a mint julep

2685
02:08:51,825 --> 02:08:54,036
waiting on the other side, sir.

2686
02:08:55,329 --> 02:08:58,082
Release your soul to me.

2687
02:09:20,938 --> 02:09:21,939
Sorry!

2688
02:09:22,815 --> 02:09:24,441
Sorry! Sorry!

2689
02:09:24,983 --> 02:09:26,693
Sex Panther, I summon thee!

2690
02:09:42,668 --> 02:09:44,086
Oh, no! Look out!

2691
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:52,010
Oh, it's the ghost of Stonewall Jackson.

2692
02:09:52,136 --> 02:09:55,180
Everyone, it's the ghost
of Stonewall Jackson.

2693
02:09:55,305 --> 02:09:57,015
Why do we have to fight?

2694
02:09:57,141 --> 02:09:59,017
There's so much
I could learn from you...

2695
02:09:59,309 --> 02:10:02,187
Colonel Burgundy, I will
give you three questions

2696
02:10:02,271 --> 02:10:04,773
and then I shall consume your soul.

2697
02:10:04,857 --> 02:10:07,276
Okay. Do you dwell in heaven?

2698
02:10:07,359 --> 02:10:10,195
I march upon a shadowy shore

2699
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:13,866
betwixt the world of men
and the shivering gates of heaven.

2700
02:10:13,949 --> 02:10:16,618
- Oh, so purgatory.
- No.

2701
02:10:16,702 --> 02:10:19,872
Shadow shore, betwixt the world of men

2702
02:10:19,955 --> 02:10:22,040
and the shimmering gates of heaven.

2703
02:10:22,207 --> 02:10:24,126
In the middle. Between the two.

2704
02:10:24,376 --> 02:10:26,879
- Do you have another question?
- Yes.

2705
02:10:28,547 --> 02:10:30,466
Of all the new Japanese car imports

2706
02:10:30,549 --> 02:10:32,549
that are on the market today,
what's your favorite?

2707
02:10:32,718 --> 02:10:34,470
That is your question?

2708
02:10:34,553 --> 02:10:36,638
I am a decorated general

2709
02:10:36,722 --> 02:10:39,391
who has come from
the afterlife to visit you.

2710
02:10:39,558 --> 02:10:40,809
That's my second question.

2711
02:10:41,393 --> 02:10:43,061
- All right, Honda.
- Oh, good.

2712
02:10:43,187 --> 02:10:45,564
I like the mixture of the stylish interior

2713
02:10:45,689 --> 02:10:46,899
with the gas efficiency.

2714
02:10:47,399 --> 02:10:49,818
- One more question?
- That's right.

2715
02:10:49,902 --> 02:10:51,904
And then I shall consume your soul.

2716
02:10:52,237 --> 02:10:55,032
That's okay. Maybe I'll lay off
on the last question.

2717
02:10:55,199 --> 02:10:56,408
Are you sure?

2718
02:10:56,867 --> 02:10:58,347
I just don't want my soul consumed...

2719
02:11:04,416 --> 02:11:05,417
Hey!

2720
02:11:06,752 --> 02:11:09,338
Send my regards
to Sir Winston Churchill.

2721
02:11:09,421 --> 02:11:11,590
Please, no!

2722
02:11:14,051 --> 02:11:16,386
What in the name of Dan Roundfield?

2723
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:19,848
Gary!

2724
02:11:20,098 --> 02:11:21,600
Yes, Ron.

2725
02:11:22,684 --> 02:11:24,353
You and I never got along.

2726
02:11:24,436 --> 02:11:26,188
But using the power of my mind,

2727
02:11:26,271 --> 02:11:29,149
I was able to see in the future
that you would do good.

2728
02:11:31,026 --> 02:11:32,528
- Now, go.
- I knew it!

2729
02:11:32,611 --> 02:11:34,112
Go to your son's recital.

2730
02:11:34,279 --> 02:11:35,781
I knew you had mind powers!

2731
02:11:35,948 --> 02:11:38,116
And make it the greatest day of your life!

2732
02:11:38,200 --> 02:11:40,118
Gary, no!

2733
02:11:44,039 --> 02:11:46,208
Almighty, Almighty,
light the fuse on my call.

2734
02:11:46,291 --> 02:11:48,293
Thirty-niner-niner-14, cook these fools.

2735
02:11:48,377 --> 02:11:49,753
I repeat, cook these fools.

2736
02:12:00,931 --> 02:12:03,225
We've got to get out of here.
There's too much news!

2737
02:12:03,308 --> 02:12:04,810
Man, what a rush!

2738
02:12:04,935 --> 02:12:06,562
The monster's my friend!

2739
02:12:06,645 --> 02:12:08,647
Ron, we can still make your kid's recital!

2740
02:12:09,982 --> 02:12:11,817
Hey, Ronny.

2741
02:12:12,234 --> 02:12:14,903
Jack Lime, please, I just want
to get to my son's recital.

2742
02:12:15,153 --> 02:12:16,989
No! That's out of the question!

2743
02:12:17,072 --> 02:12:18,073
We're outnumbered, Ron.

2744
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:20,325
Foam the runway, I'm coming in hot!

2745
02:12:33,672 --> 02:12:35,674
Hello, kiddies.

2746
02:12:35,757 --> 02:12:37,801
Is there room in the sandbox
for a few more?

2747
02:12:38,010 --> 02:12:40,846
Wes Mantooth and the
Channel Nine news team!

2748
02:12:41,013 --> 02:12:42,693
Hey, what the hell are you
guys doing here?

2749
02:12:42,806 --> 02:12:44,006
This is a national news fight.

2750
02:12:44,266 --> 02:12:46,351
You made one mistake today.

2751
02:12:46,685 --> 02:12:48,770
You messed with somebody
from San Diego.

2752
02:12:49,187 --> 02:12:52,357
It's actually pronounced San Diago.

2753
02:12:52,524 --> 02:12:55,360
Hell, Ron and I may not agree
on everything,

2754
02:12:55,944 --> 02:12:57,279
but we share the bond of being

2755
02:12:57,362 --> 02:12:59,402
from the greatest city
in the history of this Earth.

2756
02:13:00,866 --> 02:13:02,701
Well, ain't that cute?

2757
02:13:02,868 --> 02:13:04,786
But you're outnumbered three-to-one.

2758
02:13:04,870 --> 02:13:06,270
Why don't you go back to your mama?

2759
02:13:06,371 --> 02:13:08,874
Don't you use my mom's name in vain.

2760
02:13:09,374 --> 02:13:11,793
Dorothy Mantooth was
a hard-working single woman

2761
02:13:11,877 --> 02:13:13,629
who raised seven children on her own

2762
02:13:13,712 --> 02:13:16,048
and she remained sexually active
till the day she died.

2763
02:13:16,340 --> 02:13:19,384
Even in her coffin she had
the ass of a 19-year-old.

2764
02:13:19,468 --> 02:13:22,679
Tight like an apricot. No disrespect.

2765
02:13:23,055 --> 02:13:26,642
She served four tours of duty
in Vietnam as a helicopter pilot.

2766
02:13:27,517 --> 02:13:30,395
She won the bronze in
the hammer throw at Helsinki.

2767
02:13:30,562 --> 02:13:32,731
I enjoyed her on the show Emergency!

2768
02:13:33,190 --> 02:13:35,859
Now here's the thing.
While I've been talking,

2769
02:13:36,026 --> 02:13:39,529
my news team has emptied
their gas tanks at your feet.

2770
02:13:41,823 --> 02:13:43,909
You crazy son of a bitch.

2771
02:13:44,201 --> 02:13:46,745
I drop this smoke and
every one of you goes "poof. "

2772
02:13:47,079 --> 02:13:49,331
Well, you forgot one thing, leatherman.

2773
02:13:49,414 --> 02:13:51,041
You drop that smoke, you die, too.

2774
02:13:54,753 --> 02:13:57,422
With the things I've done in my life,

2775
02:13:57,547 --> 02:14:00,050
oh, I know I'm going to burn in hell.

2776
02:14:00,592 --> 02:14:03,345
So I sure as shit ain't afraid
to burn here on Earth.

2777
02:14:03,762 --> 02:14:05,347
Oh, my goodness!

2778
02:14:05,430 --> 02:14:07,599
That's the most badass thing
I have ever heard.

2779
02:14:08,433 --> 02:14:09,726
All right!

2780
02:14:10,602 --> 02:14:12,020
Looks like this fight's over.

2781
02:14:13,939 --> 02:14:15,273
Let's go, boys.

2782
02:14:16,608 --> 02:14:19,111
Yay! We won! Let's celebrate!

2783
02:14:19,403 --> 02:14:20,696
Sparklers!

2784
02:14:20,779 --> 02:14:22,781
- No, no, no, no, Brick!
- No!

2785
02:14:51,977 --> 02:14:53,061
Dad!

2786
02:14:54,980 --> 02:14:57,899
I'm never gonna have
to drink horse piss!

2787
02:14:57,983 --> 02:15:00,986
Odds are you'll still have to,
but enjoy the moment, son.

2788
02:15:01,445 --> 02:15:03,739
I love you, Mom! I love you, Dad!

2789
02:15:03,822 --> 02:15:06,408
<i>A father reunited with his son.</i>

2790
02:15:06,491 --> 02:15:08,994
<i>Come on, folks, that's good stuff.</i>

2791
02:15:09,119 --> 02:15:11,788
<i>And then the same man
finally learns to love his wife</i>

2792
02:15:11,913 --> 02:15:13,498
<i>more than his career?</i>

2793
02:15:13,623 --> 02:15:15,834
<i>Suck on that, Tennessee Williams.</i>

2794
02:15:15,917 --> 02:15:18,336
<i>And how about Liam Neeson
showing up earlier?</i>

2795
02:15:18,462 --> 02:15:22,007
<i>Do you have any idea how hard
it is to get Liam Neeson?</i>

2796
02:15:22,132 --> 02:15:25,093
<i>He doesn't have a phone,
and lives on a mountaintop,</i>

2797
02:15:25,177 --> 02:15:26,928
<i>and we got him.</i>

2798
02:15:27,012 --> 02:15:29,931
<i>If that isn't worth 14 bucks,
I don't know what is.</i>

2799
02:15:30,015 --> 02:15:32,267
<i>So go home with your significant other,</i>

2800
02:15:32,350 --> 02:15:35,353
<i>and make love, and then hold
each other afterwards,</i>

2801
02:15:35,437 --> 02:15:38,774
<i>and say, "That movie delivered.</i>

2802
02:15:38,857 --> 02:15:40,942
<i>"It was the nut ï¬ush.</i>

2803
02:15:41,151 --> 02:15:43,111
<i>"Thank you, Hollywood. "</i>

2804
02:15:43,195 --> 02:15:47,365
And now, before I join this couple
in holy matrimony,

2805
02:15:47,616 --> 02:15:49,701
Brick and Chani ask us to join them

2806
02:15:49,868 --> 02:15:52,037
as they exchange their vows.

2807
02:15:52,954 --> 02:15:54,122
My dearest Brick.

2808
02:15:54,539 --> 02:15:56,458
I love the nicknames you call me.

2809
02:15:56,541 --> 02:15:58,710
Like Chani or Miss.

2810
02:15:59,669 --> 02:16:03,548
Or Miss Chani or Chani.

2811
02:16:04,049 --> 02:16:06,176
I call you Duncan Wentworth

2812
02:16:06,551 --> 02:16:08,470
or my little flesh hair creature

2813
02:16:09,304 --> 02:16:11,139
or a guy who doesn't call the police

2814
02:16:11,223 --> 02:16:13,058
when I touch his bathing suit area.

2815
02:16:15,894 --> 02:16:19,189
Chani, you make my heart beat so fast

2816
02:16:19,314 --> 02:16:20,565
that my right arm hurts

2817
02:16:20,690 --> 02:16:23,318
and I forget where I am
and what I am doing.

2818
02:16:23,693 --> 02:16:26,404
Then men shock me
with two air hockey paddles

2819
02:16:26,488 --> 02:16:27,823
and I feel better

2820
02:16:27,906 --> 02:16:30,575
except the right side
of my face sags for a while.

2821
02:16:31,243 --> 02:16:33,745
I now pronounce you man and wife.

2822
02:16:34,162 --> 02:16:35,914
You may kiss the bride.

2823
02:16:50,929 --> 02:16:52,097
Beautiful ceremony.

2824
02:22:23,386 --> 02:22:25,013
Well, hello, ladies.

2825
02:22:25,722 --> 02:22:27,223
<i>Ca? or decaf'?</i>

2826
02:22:27,390 --> 02:22:28,433
Why?

2827
02:22:28,558 --> 02:22:30,101
Oh, I need to know how
I'm gonna make your coffee

2828
02:22:30,185 --> 02:22:32,770
tomorrow morning
when you wake up in my pants.

2829
02:22:33,062 --> 02:22:35,607
You're Brian Fantana
and you're Champ Kind.

2830
02:22:35,732 --> 02:22:36,900
- We love you.
- Yeah.

2831
02:22:37,233 --> 02:22:40,904
This is a fair warning, girls,
if I get really drunk,

2832
02:22:41,404 --> 02:22:43,948
you're going to have to do all the work.

2833
02:22:44,741 --> 02:22:46,784
Yeah, and we can go back
to our place, too.

2834
02:22:46,910 --> 02:22:48,620
That way your sheets
don't get covered in hair.

2835
02:22:48,745 --> 02:22:51,539
Yeah, we've got to get up early for work.

2836
02:22:51,623 --> 02:22:53,458
- A little Asti Spumante, huh?
- Yeah.

2837
02:22:53,583 --> 02:22:55,710
Go back and listen
to some records?

2838
02:22:57,420 --> 02:22:59,214
They wanted it so bad.
