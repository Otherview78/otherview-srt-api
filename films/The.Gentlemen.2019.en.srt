1
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:50,928
<i>Get me in ten minutes, Ray.</i>

2
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:53,030
<i>Boss.</i>

3
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:10,513
- Bobby.
- Boss?

4
00:01:11,414 --> 00:01:13,416
I'll have a pint
and a pickled egg.

5
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:15,086
Coming straight up.

6
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:48,986
<i>If you wish to be
the king of the jungle,</i>

7
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,354
<i>it's not enough
to act like a king.</i>

8
00:01:54,257 --> 00:01:55,860
<i>You must be the king.</i>

9
00:01:57,128 --> 00:01:58,796
<i>And there can be no doubt.</i>

10
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,001
Because doubt causes chaos
and one's own demise.

11
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:16,413
Hello, my love.

12
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,548
It's date night tonight.

13
00:02:18,883 --> 00:02:20,885
Nine o'clock,
you and I, River Cafe.

14
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:26,456
Who's there?

15
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:29,559

Fletcher.

47
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:11,722
<i>Buenas tardes, Raymondo.</i>

48
00:05:11,856 --> 00:05:15,558
I should stab you with
that fucking rolling pin.

49
00:05:15,693 --> 00:05:19,697
Oh, don't be cunty. I was just hoping we
could have a cozy little drink together.

50
00:05:20,164 --> 00:05:24,702
So, I've got a meeting on Saturday
at your favorite newspaper.

51
00:05:25,803 --> 00:05:30,241
As the best private investigator
in this smoky little town...

52
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:32,508
good evening,
ladies and gentlemen...

53
00:05:32,643 --> 00:05:36,814
they are ready to put 150 grand in
my pocket to give them some filth.

54
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:39,250
Good for me, that,
but in this case...

55
00:05:40,985 --> 00:05:42,186
it's bad for you.

56
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:47,324
So Big Dave,
editor extraordinaire,

57
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:51,262
has developed a terrible
antipathy for your boss

58
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:54,098
and his liquorish assortment
of tasty mates.

59
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:59,303
He's out to destroy him and all those
that cozy up to him. Front cover. Bosh!

60
00:05:59,435 --> 00:06:01,939
There will be blood and fucking
feathers everywhere, my darling.

61
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:05,042
Get to it, Fletcher.
I'm starting to itch.

62
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:08,112
Now, we both know that your boss has
very, very deep pockets,

63
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:11,282
and I would like to invite him just
to have a teeny rummage in them.

64
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:14,618
What the fuck
are you talking about?

65
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:16,419
If you would be so kind

66
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:18,055
as to furnish me with
20 million British pounds,

67
00:06:18,188 --> 00:06:19,823
I will give you everything...

68
00:06:19,957 --> 00:06:23,060
memory cards, contact sheets,
recordings, the lot,

69
00:06:23,193 --> 00:06:26,630
and a modest little screenplay
I wrote all by myself.

70
00:06:26,764 --> 00:06:27,798
Hold on.

71
00:06:28,531 --> 00:06:31,969
We just went from £150,000
to 20 million.

72
00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:34,271
That's a steep rise
in 30 seconds.

73
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:37,241
Yeah, but I would argue that you're
lucky, because that is nothing

74
00:06:37,374 --> 00:06:41,078
compared to what I could,
and perhaps should, be asking.

75
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:44,148
Oh, well, thank God
you're not greedy, Fletcher,

76
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:46,650
you deluded,
shit-eating cunt.

77
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:50,621
I quite like it
when you talk dirty to me.

78
00:06:51,822 --> 00:06:54,024
I can feel myself engorging.

79
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:57,194
Come on, have a drink with me.
It's really yummy.

80
00:06:57,661 --> 00:07:00,965
I looked it up. App-ed it.
1500 quid?

81
00:07:01,098 --> 00:07:03,701
I didn't know you could spend
that much on a bottle of scotch.

82
00:07:04,568 --> 00:07:09,273
I'm gonna tell you a story to
demonstrate why my quote is my quote.

83
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,242
Will you play a game
with me, Ray?

84
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:14,945
I don't wanna play a game.

85
00:07:15,713 --> 00:07:18,449
- Please?
- No.

86
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:20,951
I said play a fucking game
with me, Ray.

87
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,728
Right.

88
00:07:31,195 --> 00:07:32,296
Lovely.

89
00:07:32,796 --> 00:07:36,300
Now, I want you
to imagine a character,

90
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:39,703
a dramatic character,
like in a book or a play or a film.

91
00:07:39,837 --> 00:07:42,439
But not digital,
not on a memory stick.

92
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:46,010
Analog. Chemical process.
"Keep the grain in the picture," I say.

93
00:07:46,143 --> 00:07:47,644
Old-school, 35 mill.

94
00:07:52,616 --> 00:07:54,351
Now, I'm seeing this
through a lens, I am,

95
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:56,253
and I'm not talking about
the small screen.

96
00:07:56,387 --> 00:07:57,988
It's not TV, Raymond.

97
00:07:58,122 --> 00:08:00,991
As I said,
old-school cinema format.

98
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:04,928
It's what we in the business called
anamorphic, or ratio 2.35 to 1.

99
00:08:05,062 --> 00:08:07,831
And I want you to join me
on this cinematic journey,

100
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:09,733
'cause it is cinema, Ray.

101
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:12,836
It's beautiful,
beautiful cinema.

102
00:08:13,771 --> 00:08:16,306
Now, roll camera.

103
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:20,844
<i>Enter our protagonist.</i>

104
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:23,147
<i>He's good-looking,
he's gorgeous,</i>

105
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,549
<i>he's golden age,
he's a proper handsome cunt.</i>

106
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:30,187
<i>His name is Mickey Pearson.</i>

107
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:32,856
Unique background
has our Mickey.

108
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,728
<i>American born, Rhodes scholar,
so he's born clever but poor.</i>

109
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:40,531
<i>Now, that's quite a leap from
a trailer park in Americana</i>

110
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:43,566
<i>to the thousand-year-old</i>
<i>university in old</i> Angleterre,

111
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,071
<i>where he studies
the dark art of horticulture.</i>

112
00:08:47,204 --> 00:08:50,274
But he never finished his education,
never went home, because...

113
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:52,576
<i>he found his vocation.</i>

114
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:54,011
<i>A naughty vocation.</i>

115
00:08:54,845 --> 00:08:56,380
<i>He's a bad boy.</i>

116
00:08:56,513 --> 00:08:59,116
<i>He starts dealing
the dirty wonder weed</i>

117
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:02,419
<i>to his rich, British,
upper-class uni pals</i>

118
00:09:02,553 --> 00:09:04,888
<i>and realizes
he's rather good at it.</i>

119
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:07,791
<i>He's clear and objective
about ambition</i>

120
00:09:07,925 --> 00:09:11,428
<i>and he can surf the echelons
of our complicated culture.</i>

121
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:16,300
<i>He knew how to take advantage
of his advantage.</i>

122
00:09:18,302 --> 00:09:19,970
<i>He was a hungry animal,
you see.</i>

123
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:23,107
<i>He was powerful and ruthless,
cunning and quick,</i>

124
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,609
<i>charismatic and smart, but...</i>

125
00:09:25,742 --> 00:09:28,479
<i>he had to do some naughty
things to get where he got,</i>

126
00:09:28,612 --> 00:09:30,247
<i>to establish his position,</i>

127
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,016
<i>to show he wasn't just
teeth, tits and tan.</i>

128
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,953
Well, he wasn't
fucking hollow, was he?

129
00:09:38,856 --> 00:09:40,390
<i>He had an engine
under his hood</i>

130
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:42,926
<i>and a gun in his holster.</i>

131
00:09:45,362 --> 00:09:47,831
So, he's not exactly clean,
our Mickey.

132
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:49,733
He has come up the hard way.

133
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:52,469
He's earned his position,
shall we say.

134
00:09:52,604 --> 00:09:54,304
<i>Well, that was the early days,</i>

135
00:09:54,438 --> 00:09:57,474
<i>and he cracked on with
his New World pioneer spirit.</i>

136
00:09:58,175 --> 00:10:01,778
What's he worth today?
100, 200, 500 million?

137
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:04,515
But now the plot
begins to thicken.

138
00:10:04,648 --> 00:10:07,217
He has reached
a crossroads in his life.

139
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:09,653
The middle class and the middle
age, they've got to him.

140
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:13,323
They've corrupted his appetite
for the horrors. He's gone soft.

141
00:10:13,457 --> 00:10:16,326
He wanted to cash in his chips
and get out of the game,

142
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,029
and he seems to have found
the perfect customer.

143
00:10:19,163 --> 00:10:20,497
Smash cut, please...

144
00:10:20,998 --> 00:10:23,000
<i>to interior, a gala dinner.</i>

145
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:26,069
Just a few words to say
thank you to Michael Pearson

146
00:10:26,203 --> 00:10:28,672
for his limitless generosity
and time.

147
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:33,277
<i>Now, Mickey has been cultivating
a special relationship</i>

148
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,681
<i>with the erudite, learned and
broad-minded Matthew Berger.</i>

149
00:10:37,814 --> 00:10:41,185
Yes, Raymond, I do know about
the Jewish billionaire cowboy,

150
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:44,388
another slice of Americana
creating drama in <i>Angleterre.</i>

151
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:48,525
And finally to Matthew Berger
blindsiding us with his donation

152
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,828
to build the entire cognitive
behavioral therapy unit.

153
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:54,666
<i>So these two have met before.
Fuck knows where.</i>

154
00:10:54,798 --> 00:10:58,735
<i>Presumably at the annual international
drug dealers convention in Las Vegas.</i>

155
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:00,938
<i>And they've done
some small deals together,</i>

156
00:11:01,071 --> 00:11:03,407
<i>but now they're ready
for the big one.</i>

157
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,310
Well, that was unexpected,
Matthew.

158
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,246
Now I understand why you're
seated at the head of the table.

159
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:12,015
Snuck that one right by me, didn't
you, you naughty little girl?

160
00:11:12,382 --> 00:11:14,418
Making a splash
with the gentry.

161
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:17,120
Oh, I like to make a splash
whenever possible.

162
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:21,391
Well, you also seem to understand
the significance of a proper attire.

163
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:22,926
Indeed I do.

164
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,361
I believe
a sense of ownership

165
00:11:24,494 --> 00:11:26,196
is vital
in every aspect of life,

166
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,700
perhaps never more so than
when it comes to wardrobe.

167
00:11:28,832 --> 00:11:32,536
For every look there is a season,
and for every season a strategy.

168
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,072
<i>Now starts the alpha dance.</i>

169
00:11:35,205 --> 00:11:36,840
<i>They're not really talking
about clothes, Raymond.</i>

170
00:11:36,974 --> 00:11:38,576
<i>Oh, fucking no.</i>

171
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,377
<i>They're like
a pair of old doggies</i>

172
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,946
<i>sniffing round one another's
intellectual assholes.</i>

173
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,749
<i>It's a good old-fashioned
cock-off, Raymond.</i>

174
00:11:45,882 --> 00:11:48,586
Michael, I'm looking forward
to doing business together.

175
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:51,555
- May we excuse ourselves?
- Yes, please.

176
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:54,291
We should say good night
to our host.

177
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:00,530
So what do you think?

178
00:12:01,098 --> 00:12:02,634
I'm not sure.

179
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:03,767
Your Grace.

180
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,302
He's a fox,

181
00:12:05,435 --> 00:12:07,104
and foxes
have a predictable nature.

182
00:12:07,237 --> 00:12:09,006
Trust this Jew
about that Jew.

183
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:10,608
If you let him
in the henhouse,

184
00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:12,610
you can expect blood
and feathers everywhere.

185
00:12:13,745 --> 00:12:16,246
Fresh from
a farmyard pheasant shoot,

186
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,116
these two are starting
to like each other.

187
00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:21,785
It's looking good, Ray.
It's looking fucking good.

188
00:12:21,918 --> 00:12:24,521
I'm impressed with what
you've done with your enterprise.

189
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:26,790
You see, try as I might,
I can't work out how you do it,

190
00:12:26,923 --> 00:12:28,693
and bush is my game.

191
00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:31,328
How does anyone grow
50 tons of super skunk

192
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:33,363
without letting anyone else
know how they do it?

193
00:12:33,497 --> 00:12:35,899
I'm flattered to hear that
from you, Matthew.

194
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:38,435
I imagine that big brain of yours
is sweating a stream of tears

195
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:40,137
just trying
to figure it out.

196
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,739
Brilliance
should be acknowledged.

197
00:12:41,872 --> 00:12:42,939
Mm.

198
00:12:43,073 --> 00:12:44,808
Run the numbers
by me again.

199
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:48,512
200 million gross p.a.,
100 million net.

200
00:12:48,646 --> 00:12:50,080
But your people
know this already.

201
00:12:50,213 --> 00:12:52,282
They've swept the numbers
for months now.

202
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:56,320
The bottom line is I'll sell
it to you for 400 million.

203
00:13:02,926 --> 00:13:05,228
But you knew that already.
Hop in.

204
00:13:05,362 --> 00:13:07,998
<i>Now, I can't be specific
about the heroes and zeros,</i>

205
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:10,568
but there was a lot of money
hanging in the balance.

206
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:14,204
Question: What would it be
worth to have the power

207
00:13:14,338 --> 00:13:16,907
to be able to pull the plug
on an operation like that?

208
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,144
Answer: A greedy man would
want half the sale price,

209
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:24,314
but a smart man would know
that 20 million pounds

210
00:13:24,448 --> 00:13:27,851
was just about uncomfortable enough
to make everyone feel comfortable.

211
00:13:28,552 --> 00:13:31,589
You're a cunning and creative
toad, aren't you, Fletcher,

212
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:33,557
coming up
with a plan like this?

213
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:35,593
Yeah, but I didn't really
come up with it, did I?

214
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:37,194
It was Big Dave.

215
00:13:37,327 --> 00:13:38,962
He commissioned me
to do a job on Mickey,

216
00:13:39,096 --> 00:13:40,631
you know, sniff about,
keep an eye on him,

217
00:13:40,765 --> 00:13:42,700
go through his bins,
reveal his sins.

218
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:47,537
Mickey Pearson, the odious Yankee gangster.
We're gonna bury him.

219
00:13:47,672 --> 00:13:51,475
Because it seems he's got himself
a new friend. Lord Pressfield.

220
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:54,544
Question:
Is that the Lord Pressfield?

221
00:13:54,878 --> 00:13:56,246
<i>His Grace, the duke?</i>

222
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,015
Yeah. Once fourth in line
to the throne.

223
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:00,718
Apparently Mickey Pearson
has squeaked his way

224
00:14:00,852 --> 00:14:03,153
into the crack
of his fat, posh ass.

225
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:07,759
This is yours, Fletcher. I need a man
with your creativity, with your nose.

226
00:14:07,891 --> 00:14:09,594
Now, you know
you're my favorite bloodhound.

227
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:11,528
I just think it's really
important to remember

228
00:14:11,662 --> 00:14:13,096
who you're talking to, Dave.

229
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,432
Of course I remember,
Fletcher.

230
00:14:15,565 --> 00:14:18,468
So just make absolutely sure the
check doesn't disappoint this time.

231
00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:21,271
The number is 150,000.

232
00:14:21,606 --> 00:14:24,307
He wants to ruin him,

233
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:27,377
but I am here
to do you a favor.

234
00:14:28,613 --> 00:14:31,281
And it's not like you're not
getting something for your money.

235
00:14:31,415 --> 00:14:34,551
You could even turn that script
into a feature film, Raymond.

236
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:38,321
We could make it together.
We could be partners.

237
00:14:39,055 --> 00:14:40,792
I have learned off you lot.

238
00:14:41,091 --> 00:14:44,528
You gotta look after number
one, and now it's my turn.

239
00:14:45,696 --> 00:14:49,433
The sun is not going up
for me, Ray. It's going down.

240
00:14:50,835 --> 00:14:53,871
So why has Big Dave
got it in for my boss?

241
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:56,039
Two months ago,
your man Mickey

242
00:14:56,173 --> 00:14:58,776
<i>made my man Dave feel
like a right fucking idiot.</i>

243
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,778
Henry. Mickey.

244
00:15:00,912 --> 00:15:02,045
How did he do that?

245
00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:03,547
Didn't accept his hand.

246
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:05,650
- Dave. <i>Daily Print.</i>
- Yes.

247
00:15:06,516 --> 00:15:08,586
No. Editor
of the <i>Daily Print.</i>

248
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:11,488
<i>Turns out Dave had
gone after one of Mickey's lords,</i>

249
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:13,523
<i>did a proper tabloid job
on him.</i>

250
00:15:13,658 --> 00:15:15,827
<i>It would appear that His
Lordship had had a quick spin</i>

251
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:18,195
<i>on one of
his attractive young footmen.</i>

252
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:20,932
<i>After the splash, shares
crashed, job went, wife followed,</i>

253
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:23,133
<i>and even his kids
disowned him.</i>

254
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:25,570
<i>Well, that Dave
can't half be a cunt.</i>

255
00:15:26,336 --> 00:15:28,104
But no one
will pull him on it.

256
00:15:28,238 --> 00:15:30,540
Too fucking scared that Dave
will do a feature on them.

257
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:33,477
<i>But your Mickey, he's got
a fabulous set of balls.</i>

258
00:15:33,611 --> 00:15:36,781
So he snubbed him in front of a crowd
that Dave could only wish he belonged to.

259
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:40,150
You know, lords and ladies, the sort that
Mickey feels very comfortable in front of.

260
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:42,920
Men, excuse us.

261
00:15:43,086 --> 00:15:45,088
<i>Well, he might just as
well have pulled Dave's cock off.</i>

262
00:15:45,222 --> 00:15:46,958
I do believe that was a bit
of a fuck off, Dave.

263
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,059
<i>'Cause he just
fizzled like a party balloon.</i>

264
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:51,796
That's no reason
to go after a fella.

265
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:54,599
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
He wants Mickey's blood.

266
00:15:54,732 --> 00:15:58,201
And he would be getting it
too, if it wasn't for...

267
00:15:59,236 --> 00:16:02,673
You're a filthy fantasist,
and now it's time to leave.

268
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:06,109
Oh, don't be silly.
I'm only just lubing you up.

269
00:16:06,243 --> 00:16:11,114
Now, there is a reason why Matthew,
or anyone else for that matter,

270
00:16:11,248 --> 00:16:14,217
cannot work out
how Mickey does what he does.

271
00:16:14,351 --> 00:16:18,154
How does he grow 50 tons of white
widow super cheese every year?

272
00:16:18,288 --> 00:16:20,190
Everyone knows
that needs a lot of space.

273
00:16:20,323 --> 00:16:23,728
So where is the space and how
come he's kept it under wraps?

274
00:16:23,861 --> 00:16:27,030
<i>You can't just dig a hole in the ground
and drop 200 shipping containers in there.</i>

275
00:16:27,163 --> 00:16:28,733
<i>Oh, no, my love.
That will not work.</i>

276
00:16:28,866 --> 00:16:32,670
No. You have to be creative.
You need an angle.

277
00:16:32,803 --> 00:16:35,606
The problem with land in this
country is there's not much of it...

278
00:16:36,974 --> 00:16:39,911
and there's public access even
when it's supposed to be private.

279
00:16:40,477 --> 00:16:43,380
And the public have rights:
dog walkers...

280
00:16:43,513 --> 00:16:45,181
Yes, jog on.

281
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:47,752
<i>...footpaths, right to roam,</i>

282
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:49,352
<i>bimblers, ramblers,</i>

283
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:50,922
<i>badger lovers...</i>

284
00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:53,591
<i>...and any other busy cunt
with enough time on his hands</i>

285
00:16:53,724 --> 00:16:55,058
to sniff
the green tweed of England.

286
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:56,694
Good morning!

287
00:16:56,827 --> 00:16:58,328
And they have groups,

288
00:16:58,461 --> 00:17:01,999
<i>forums, meetings,
social media,</i>

289
00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:04,001
<i>and they love
a good chat and a hiss</i>

290
00:17:04,134 --> 00:17:06,837
about anyone who's decided to
mow his lawn without a license.

291
00:17:07,972 --> 00:17:11,241
And then there's the helicopters,
drones, Google Earth,

292
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:13,443
<i>heritage sites,
parish councils,</i>

293
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:14,946
and the beat goes on.

294
00:17:15,746 --> 00:17:18,214
And that's before you even think
about getting power in here.

295
00:17:20,585 --> 00:17:23,621
So what is
Mickey's unique method?

296
00:17:23,754 --> 00:17:28,258
I tip my cap at the cheek,
at the elegance, at the class.

297
00:17:29,026 --> 00:17:30,995
And what would
that method be exactly?

298
00:17:31,127 --> 00:17:33,463
You have to understand
a culture to understand a man.

299
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,967
<i>Toffs, aristocrats,</i>

300
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:39,070
<i>dukes, duchesses,
lords and ladies,</i>

301
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:41,072
lots of land
and fuck all dough.

302
00:17:41,204 --> 00:17:44,976
<i>Houses to keep, damp to
keep out, silver to polish.</i>

303
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:48,111
You must remember
that cash is very persuasive

304
00:17:48,244 --> 00:17:51,649
<i>to the class that got spanked by
angry lefties and death duties.</i>

305
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:56,486
<i>And every time you inherit a
fortune, you lose half to the state.</i>

306
00:17:56,621 --> 00:17:58,623
<i>So this is my moment to swoop in</i>

307
00:17:58,756 --> 00:18:00,791
<i>like a guardian fucking angel</i>

308
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:04,327
<i>and offer my services so they
can keep their houses in order.</i>

309
00:18:04,461 --> 00:18:06,597
And they're not too bothered
about what I do,

310
00:18:07,064 --> 00:18:10,166
<i>as long as that cash
keeps rolling in each year.</i>

311
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,070
It's good to get a lord, yes,
but it's not easy.

312
00:18:13,203 --> 00:18:17,008
It takes work,
wine, women and disco.

313
00:18:17,575 --> 00:18:20,343
<i>Twelve sites. Twelve farms.</i>

314
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:23,380
<i>One thousand of these estates
in the great UK.</i>

315
00:18:23,513 --> 00:18:25,515
<i>Bonne chance</i>
trying to find them all.

316
00:18:26,684 --> 00:18:29,720
That's it. My infrastructure.

317
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:35,291
And that, sir, is, with my
blessing, what you are paying for.

318
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,729
If it's as discreet and as
lucrative as you claim it is,

319
00:18:38,863 --> 00:18:40,563
I'll buy the whole business.

320
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:42,532
But enough foreplay, Michael.

321
00:18:43,134 --> 00:18:44,534
I wanna see your plant.

322
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:48,939
I've gone to great lengths
to make my operation

323
00:18:49,073 --> 00:18:51,609
as invisible as possible,
Matthew.

324
00:18:51,742 --> 00:18:54,177
If you were standing on my
bush, you wouldn't know it.

325
00:18:56,312 --> 00:18:59,784
As a matter of fact,
you are standing on my bush.

326
00:19:02,753 --> 00:19:04,789
It's a spectacular business,
Michael.

327
00:19:05,823 --> 00:19:07,658
Such a shame it will go
bankrupt in ten years

328
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:09,894
when things go legal
in the great UK.

329
00:19:10,527 --> 00:19:12,863
And you want me
to pay top dollar for it?

330
00:19:13,164 --> 00:19:15,198
A nugget under half a yard?

331
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:17,668
That is the price.

332
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:21,438
Now step inside and I'll show
you what half a yard gets you.

333
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:30,948
Ooh. A delightful tool shed
for 400 million dollars.

334
00:19:31,582 --> 00:19:33,383
Is the ball-peen hammer
included?

335
00:19:33,516 --> 00:19:36,419
Course it is.
Now let me show you the nails.

336
00:19:44,427 --> 00:19:45,528
Watch your head.

337
00:19:46,262 --> 00:19:47,598
Carry on, chaps.

338
00:19:58,843 --> 00:20:01,112
England's
green and pleasant land.

339
00:20:03,214 --> 00:20:04,715
Those are some nails.

340
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:09,120
Location, staff, technology.

341
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:13,891
See, you're buying the substructure
for the superstructure to come,

342
00:20:14,524 --> 00:20:18,195
and with purchase you will
inherit the best sites available,

343
00:20:18,328 --> 00:20:21,431
the finest botanists and herb
sommeliers in the world,

344
00:20:21,564 --> 00:20:25,136
as well as the most innovative
marijuana technology on the planet.

345
00:20:26,302 --> 00:20:28,839
And when this little piggy
goes to legal market

346
00:20:28,973 --> 00:20:32,009
and the demand
way outpaces the supply...

347
00:20:32,977 --> 00:20:36,412
these locations,
these green-fingered botanical boys,

348
00:20:36,546 --> 00:20:38,849
as well as
my superior technology,

349
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:40,283
will be at a premium.

350
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:43,120
And you would own them all.

351
00:20:45,956 --> 00:20:49,994
Did you know it took 15 years after
alcohol prohibition ended back home

352
00:20:50,127 --> 00:20:52,263
for the legal market
to scratch that itch?

353
00:20:53,063 --> 00:20:54,832
Fifteen years.

354
00:20:55,431 --> 00:20:57,534
And that's if
you do nothing with it.

355
00:20:58,235 --> 00:21:00,971
Yes, it's a win-win,
no matter how you look at it.

356
00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:04,809
And I'm not greedy.
You and I both know

357
00:21:04,942 --> 00:21:08,145
that 400 million is a
fair-to-generous asking price,

358
00:21:09,046 --> 00:21:11,414
especially considering
that once this game's kosher,

359
00:21:11,548 --> 00:21:14,350
it's going to be worth
somewhere between 200 billion

360
00:21:14,484 --> 00:21:17,788
and, well,
half a trillion pounds.

361
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:19,322
Annually.

362
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,357
Weed.

363
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:22,693
Bush.

364
00:21:23,294 --> 00:21:24,795
Skunk-amola.

365
00:21:25,495 --> 00:21:27,698
White widow super cheese.

366
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,668
It's the new gold rush.

367
00:21:31,836 --> 00:21:34,805
This is the thin end
of a very fat wedge, sir.

368
00:21:35,538 --> 00:21:38,474
If it's such a fat wedge,
why don't you keep it?

369
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:43,814
You see, I've developed a reputation
as a man who came up the hard way.

370
00:21:44,547 --> 00:21:47,785
You could say that there's blood
on these pretty white hands.

371
00:21:48,786 --> 00:21:52,723
But in the new business,
once legal and under the jurisdiction

372
00:21:52,857 --> 00:21:56,861
of the respectable umbrella
of ministerial legitimacy,

373
00:21:56,994 --> 00:22:00,664
an enterprise like this will
need a face with a clean past,

374
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:04,001
which sadly I do not possess.

375
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:06,237
Retirement
doesn't sound so bad.

376
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:09,807
Long walks in the countryside,
pruning roses with my better half,

377
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,374
raising some cubs.

378
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:14,078
I've earned it.

379
00:22:14,812 --> 00:22:18,749
Look, we both know growing
is only 50% of the business.

380
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:21,517
I need
your European connections.

381
00:22:21,652 --> 00:22:23,854
I've seen
how the sausage is made.

382
00:22:23,988 --> 00:22:25,488
Now tell me
about the butcher shops.

383
00:22:26,422 --> 00:22:28,125
Well, that comes later,
Matthew,

384
00:22:28,692 --> 00:22:30,526
when the money's in escrow.

385
00:22:30,661 --> 00:22:33,964
Now that we've established
the dilemma of our protagonist,

386
00:22:34,098 --> 00:22:37,635
let us turn to our antagonist.

387
00:22:37,768 --> 00:22:40,638
Many miles away,
across the open plains,

388
00:22:40,771 --> 00:22:46,143
another beautiful feral beast
lopes his way to a watering hole.

389
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:47,543
Who are you talking about
now?

390
00:22:47,678 --> 00:22:51,481
I talk, Raymondo, of Dry Eye.

391
00:22:51,615 --> 00:22:53,117
Oh, Dry Eye.

392
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,986
What is he?
Chinese? Japanese? Pekingese?

393
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,487
Get on your fucking knees?

394
00:22:57,621 --> 00:22:59,422
Dirty dragon filth.

395
00:22:59,555 --> 00:23:02,726
<i>♪ Yellow is the color
Gambling is the game ♪</i>

396
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:07,264
He explodes on the scene like a millennial
fucking firecracker. Bang, bang, bang.

397
00:23:07,398 --> 00:23:09,300
You chee-bye motherfuckers!

398
00:23:09,432 --> 00:23:11,402
<i>I'm gonna have to
stop you right there, Fletcher.</i>

399
00:23:11,936 --> 00:23:13,804
That doesn't sound like
the Dry Eye I know.

400
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:16,407
Just making sure you're
paying attention, Raymond.

401
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:20,210
So let's cut instead
to a somewhat anticlimactic

402
00:23:20,344 --> 00:23:23,113
<i>but suave and debonair
Dry Eye,</i>

403
00:23:23,247 --> 00:23:25,082
<i>like a Chinese James Bond.</i>

404
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,985
<i>"Ricense" to kill.</i>

405
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,689
- Open them up.
- Yes, boss.

406
00:23:36,894 --> 00:23:38,295
Good Lord.

407
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:43,867
Hose them down, load them up
and fuck them off.

408
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:46,770
- Let me have a look at 432.
- Yes, boss. It's just right here.

409
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:56,113
There's 120 rims, uh,
32 LS engines, 60 custom...

410
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:58,048
All right. Pay the man.

411
00:23:58,182 --> 00:24:01,919
Sorry, chaps. I quoted you for
a 20 when it's a 40-footer.

412
00:24:02,052 --> 00:24:04,121
It's gonna be double bubble.

413
00:24:04,788 --> 00:24:06,623
Double bubble?

414
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:11,795
A gentleman's quote
is a gentleman's word.

415
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,667
Now, either you or your family are
gonna have to pay for that lesson.

416
00:24:18,402 --> 00:24:19,937
Do we have an understanding?

417
00:24:21,105 --> 00:24:22,272
Yes, boss.

418
00:24:23,574 --> 00:24:25,342
Give the soppy prick
his money.

419
00:24:28,946 --> 00:24:31,148
<i>Anyway,
let's put a pin in Dry Eye</i>

420
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:33,150
and turn again to Mickey.

421
00:24:33,617 --> 00:24:35,719
If you're thinking
of smoking that in here...

422
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:37,421
don't.

423
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:39,023
I find that confusing.

424
00:24:39,156 --> 00:24:42,393
Do you mean don't smoke
or don't think?

425
00:24:46,196 --> 00:24:47,831
Oh...

426
00:24:47,965 --> 00:24:49,867
Oh, all right, all right,
it's going out.

427
00:24:52,002 --> 00:24:55,773
<i>♪ Her daddy

428
00:24:55,906 --> 00:25:00,044
<i>♪ Her mommy

00:25:00,177 --> 00:25:04,214

431
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:13,357
<i>I think the time has come
for me to introduce you to our queen.</i>

432
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,758
Harold, bag.

433
00:25:14,892 --> 00:25:16,660
<i>A Cockney Cleopatra</i>

434
00:25:16,794 --> 00:25:18,729
<i>to Mickey's cowboy Caesar.</i>

435
00:25:18,862 --> 00:25:22,499
<i>The only weak link in his

436
00:25:22,633 --> 00:25:26,437

437
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,238
<i>with his beauteous lady wife.</i>

438
00:25:28,372 --> 00:25:30,774
I'm trying to do you
a favor here, Mike,

439
00:25:30,908 --> 00:25:33,243
but every time I do you a favor,
it ends up costing me too.

440
00:25:33,377 --> 00:25:35,712
- <i>Now, come on, Ros...</i>
- Why is Miss Kova still here?

441
00:25:35,846 --> 00:25:37,981
That Range was supposed
to be finished this morning.

442
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:41,118
- I'm not talking to you, Mike.
- Sorry, boss. Rodge is on the Range.

443
00:25:41,251 --> 00:25:43,987
How many times have I told you?
I don't want Roger up front.

444
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:46,590
This is a sanctuary
for the ladies. Where is he?

445
00:25:46,723 --> 00:25:48,492
He's up in your office
with your husband.

446
00:25:51,728 --> 00:25:54,331
Misha, darling, I'll have you
out of here in 20 minutes.

447
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:56,967
Rosalind, I've got a spin
class in half an hour.

448
00:25:57,101 --> 00:25:58,936
Twenty minutes
and no charge.

449
00:25:59,069 --> 00:26:00,771
Lisa, champagne.

450
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:03,607
- Mike, are you still there?
<i>- Of course I'm still fucking here.</i>

451
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,877
Right, well, if you're still there,
who's ordering the fucking parts?

452
00:26:07,177 --> 00:26:08,378
So what do you think?

453
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,247
Ringing the bell,
but not too loud.

454
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:12,116
Dipped in honey.

455
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:14,418
That's on the money.

456
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:17,654
But you always could make
a good cup of tea, Mickey.

457
00:26:17,788 --> 00:26:19,289
Very nice.

458
00:26:20,224 --> 00:26:21,291
Hello, Ros.

459
00:26:22,526 --> 00:26:23,894
What the fuck
is going on in here?

460
00:26:24,394 --> 00:26:25,796
I should have known
it was you behind this.

461
00:26:26,363 --> 00:26:27,831
Rodge is supposed to be
working down there

462
00:26:27,965 --> 00:26:29,433
and you're up here
blowing his brains out.

463
00:26:29,566 --> 00:26:31,401
- I'm on it, boss.
- You wanna be.

464
00:26:31,869 --> 00:26:33,403
Don't blame the Dodge,
dear.

465
00:26:33,537 --> 00:26:35,072
You know he's got
a special nose

466
00:26:35,205 --> 00:26:37,040
and he's doing
this old dog a favor.

467
00:26:37,174 --> 00:26:38,610
Dodge, get down there
and earn your money.

468
00:26:38,742 --> 00:26:39,776
Gone.

469
00:26:42,646 --> 00:26:44,281
What you doing here anyway?

470
00:26:44,414 --> 00:26:46,618
Thought I'd come by to have
a cup of tea with my wife.

471
00:26:47,284 --> 00:26:49,353
Well, go on, then.
Put the kettle on.

472
00:26:51,788 --> 00:26:53,490
Looks like
the deal's gone through.

473
00:26:54,358 --> 00:26:56,527
- Second thoughts?
- No second thoughts.

474
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,328
I like middle age.

475
00:26:58,462 --> 00:27:01,832
I like gentrification,
private schools, fine wines

476
00:27:01,965 --> 00:27:05,702
and a spoonful of caviar
to help my medicine go down.

477
00:27:06,537 --> 00:27:09,940
But most importantly, I'm looking
forward to spending more time with you.

478
00:27:10,073 --> 00:27:11,141
Course you are.

479
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:13,544
Look, I don't want you
knocking around here

480
00:27:13,677 --> 00:27:15,979
feeling all unemployed
and lost with yourself.

481
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,881
Well, fuck me.

482
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,184
Most wives would beg
their other halves

483
00:27:20,317 --> 00:27:22,119
to get out
of this game, but not you.

484
00:27:22,252 --> 00:27:23,720
That's because
I know you, darling.

485
00:27:24,821 --> 00:27:27,958
Look, you'll have to
do this elegantly, love.

486
00:27:28,626 --> 00:27:32,062
If word spreads that you're getting
out, that could read as weakness.

487
00:27:32,196 --> 00:27:34,364
And if you smell smoke,
it's 'cause there's a fire,

488
00:27:34,498 --> 00:27:36,668
and that could
get expensive.

489
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,703
So you're gonna have to stamp that
out without any gentrification.

490
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,738
But not you, love.

491
00:27:43,575 --> 00:27:45,275
Don't you do anything messy.

492
00:27:46,076 --> 00:27:48,345
That's why you've
got people, remember?

493
00:27:48,478 --> 00:27:50,514
I fucking love you, babe.

494
00:27:50,648 --> 00:27:52,015
Course you do.

495
00:27:52,983 --> 00:27:54,117
Any chance?

496
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:57,521
No, you can wait.

497
00:27:57,955 --> 00:28:00,190
I've got a red-hot Russki
with her finger on the trigger.

498
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:02,960
- Gotta deal with it.
- I don't mind the two of yous.

499
00:28:03,093 --> 00:28:04,795
Go on, fuck off.

500
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,931
Fletcher...

501
00:28:09,366 --> 00:28:11,001
why are you
wasting our time?

502
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:14,004
I know what happens in my
world and what doesn't.

503
00:28:14,137 --> 00:28:17,241
What I fail to recognize is
why Michael should be motivated

504
00:28:17,374 --> 00:28:19,109
to write you
a check for 20 million.

505
00:28:19,243 --> 00:28:22,913
I find you very impatient, Raymond.
I am a storyteller.

506
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:25,515
As they say in the film game,
I'm laying pipe.

507
00:28:25,882 --> 00:28:27,719
Well, you'd better put
something through it soon.

508
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:30,254
So what is that?
Is that a barbecue as well?

509
00:28:32,055 --> 00:28:34,925
- Yes, it is, Fletcher.
- I love a barbie.

510
00:28:35,325 --> 00:28:37,094
That is a useful bit of plant,
then, isn't it?

511
00:28:37,227 --> 00:28:39,997
So that heats up your knees
and cooks at the same time?

512
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,833
You gotta show me
how to get one of them.

513
00:28:42,966 --> 00:28:45,269
Well, you can take it with
you if you fuck off now.

514
00:28:46,436 --> 00:28:47,739
Ray.

515
00:28:48,905 --> 00:28:50,274
Is there any chance
of a steak?

516
00:28:56,213 --> 00:28:59,983
Yeah, all right. Got a bit of
Wagyu in the freezer as it happens.

517
00:29:00,117 --> 00:29:03,588
- I've never had Wagyu.
- Yeah, well, it'll be wasted on you, but it's all I've got.

518
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:05,657
- I'll get it, mate.
- Oh, no, you're all right.

519
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:07,692
- Just stay right there.
- Oh.

520
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,328
Ow, fuck me!

521
00:29:12,796 --> 00:29:13,897
It's hot.

522
00:29:22,105 --> 00:29:25,142
He's a sly fox,
that Fletcher.

523
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:33,283
Night-night, Aslan.

524
00:29:33,984 --> 00:29:35,819
32 LS engines?

525
00:29:36,286 --> 00:29:38,488
You got all these parts
on a 40-foot container?

526
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,457
Yeah.

527
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,492
How'd you get
your hands on that?

528
00:29:44,094 --> 00:29:46,196
Ask no questions,
hear no lies.

529
00:29:46,664 --> 00:29:47,699
Hence the price.

530
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:50,702
- So how much?
- Oh, no charge.

531
00:29:50,834 --> 00:29:53,136
Okay, so what's the price?

532
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,471
A meeting with your husband.

533
00:29:54,605 --> 00:29:56,239
Oh, fuck off.

534
00:29:56,373 --> 00:29:57,608
That's not gonna happen.

535
00:29:58,175 --> 00:29:59,543
It's in his interest.

536
00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:06,016
Tell you what, keep the parts.
Consider it a gesture of goodwill.

537
00:30:08,151 --> 00:30:09,821
You know
how to get hold of me.

538
00:30:11,488 --> 00:30:13,423
Well, I can't
promise anything.

539
00:30:13,557 --> 00:30:15,992
Dry Eye, he got his little
sit-down with Michael, didn't he?

540
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,030
Bold move, that,
coming in heavy,

541
00:30:20,163 --> 00:30:23,467
sanctioned or unsanctioned...

542
00:30:24,468 --> 00:30:27,504
<i>by the dragon head himself,
Lord George.</i>

543
00:30:28,171 --> 00:30:30,407
<i>Well, he's a naughty boy,
that George.</i>

544
00:30:30,808 --> 00:30:33,578
<i>But Dry Eye,
oh, he's next generation,</i>

545
00:30:33,711 --> 00:30:36,880
<i>and them Chinamen, they upgrade
quicker than i-fucking-Phones.</i>

546
00:30:37,013 --> 00:30:38,315
Is he making moves?

547
00:30:40,217 --> 00:30:42,052
<i>Is he breaking out on his own?</i>

548
00:30:42,185 --> 00:30:44,689
<i>Big man plans
behind Lord George's back?</i>

549
00:30:47,658 --> 00:30:51,461
To be fair, it was very nicely played
with 100 grand's worth of free car parts,

550
00:30:51,596 --> 00:30:56,066
because everyone knows that the way
to a man's heart is through his wife.

551
00:30:58,603 --> 00:31:00,470
You'd make a lovely wife,
Raymond.

552
00:31:11,014 --> 00:31:13,483
Thank you for taking the time
to see me, Michael.

553
00:31:14,351 --> 00:31:15,820
Lord George sends his best.

554
00:31:16,253 --> 00:31:18,989
I only took this meeting
because Ros asked me to.

555
00:31:19,122 --> 00:31:21,024
Make sure to never approach
her like that again.

556
00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:23,293
I meant no disrespect.

557
00:31:33,604 --> 00:31:34,705
How can I help?

558
00:31:35,873 --> 00:31:37,240
I understand
you're getting out.

559
00:31:38,408 --> 00:31:41,211
Getting out.
Getting out of what?

560
00:31:41,344 --> 00:31:43,447
Bed? My head?
The closet?

561
00:31:43,947 --> 00:31:46,082
Don't flirt with me, Dry Eye.
I'm a busy man.

562
00:31:46,684 --> 00:31:48,418
I hear you're
getting out of the game.

563
00:31:49,787 --> 00:31:52,857
And I would like you
to consider an offer.

564
00:31:52,989 --> 00:31:54,991
Look, I'm gonna stop you
right there

565
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:57,093
so you don't waste any more of
your precious breath, young man.

566
00:31:57,227 --> 00:31:59,429
This is not a discussion
for the two of us.

567
00:31:59,563 --> 00:32:01,599
Unlike the salt and pepper,
it's not on the table.

568
00:32:06,102 --> 00:32:08,538
This is a big number.

569
00:32:30,595 --> 00:32:31,662
Cash.

570
00:32:32,229 --> 00:32:35,700
I am not for sale.

571
00:32:37,935 --> 00:32:40,504
And even if I was,
you're several zeros short.

572
00:32:40,638 --> 00:32:42,840
Now, you may be able to buy
your man's sausage for that,

573
00:32:42,974 --> 00:32:45,308
but to me it just looks
rude at breakfast.

574
00:32:47,945 --> 00:32:49,012
You're out of touch.

575
00:32:52,148 --> 00:32:55,352
You're forgetting the laws of the
jungle, looking down on me.

576
00:33:00,524 --> 00:33:03,527
Now, when the silverback's
got more silver than back...

577
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:05,897
he best move on...

578
00:33:08,064 --> 00:33:09,533
before he gets moved on.

579
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:12,235
It's not dignified.

580
00:33:13,036 --> 00:33:16,874
It's beneath you, Michael.
Trying to do you a favor.

581
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:21,144
This is a big fucking number.

582
00:33:27,217 --> 00:33:28,653
And this?

583
00:33:29,486 --> 00:33:31,221
This is a big fucking gun.

584
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:41,164
Eyes not so dry now, are they?

585
00:33:43,734 --> 00:33:44,869
Hurts, does it?

586
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:48,573
You looking for your balls
or a hole in the wall?

587
00:33:48,706 --> 00:33:51,374
- Fuck!
- Where the fuck do you think you're going?

588
00:33:51,776 --> 00:33:55,111
Because you're not going out the way you
came in, you deluded duck-eating cunt.

589
00:33:55,245 --> 00:33:57,915
Talking to me about the laws of the jungle.

590
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:00,751
What was it? Something
about being beneath me?

591
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:02,319
Silver on back?

592
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,957
There's only one rule
in this fucking jungle.

593
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:09,426
When the lion's hungry,
he eats.

594
00:34:11,227 --> 00:34:12,295
<i>You're wrong, Fletcher.</i>

595
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,097
That's not how Michael works.

596
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:17,267
Yeah, I know. I know. I was
just having a bit of fun.

597
00:34:17,635 --> 00:34:19,502
Every movie needs
a bit of action, doesn't it?

598
00:34:19,637 --> 00:34:21,572
And it's not like Michael
doesn't have a reputation.

599
00:34:21,706 --> 00:34:23,440
Had a reputation.

600
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:25,776
He's been gentrified.

601
00:34:30,781 --> 00:34:32,617
<i>...big fucking number.</i>

602
00:34:33,183 --> 00:34:37,487
I know how you lot love fables,
so let me share a little fable with you.

603
00:34:39,056 --> 00:34:41,257
There once was
a young and foolish dragon

604
00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:43,628
who came to ask
a wise and cunning lion

605
00:34:43,761 --> 00:34:46,063
about acquiring
his territory.

606
00:34:46,196 --> 00:34:49,132
Now, the lion, he wasn't interested,
so he told the little dragon to fuck off.

607
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:53,004
But the dragon couldn't
understand what "fuck off" meant,

608
00:34:53,136 --> 00:34:55,973
so he persisted and
continued to ask the lion

609
00:34:56,107 --> 00:34:58,009
about acquiring
his territory.

610
00:34:58,141 --> 00:35:00,945
So the lion took
the little dragon for a walk

611
00:35:01,078 --> 00:35:03,781
and put five bullets
in his little dragon head.

612
00:35:05,482 --> 00:35:06,951
End of story.

613
00:35:09,587 --> 00:35:12,322
Now, allegedly
there's a message in there.

614
00:35:12,455 --> 00:35:15,626
I don't know what it is,
but you're a clever boy, Dry Eye.

615
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,527
Maybe you can
explain it to me.

616
00:35:19,529 --> 00:35:21,331
I think your time's up,
chaps.

617
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:24,669
Michael, you should recons...

618
00:35:27,337 --> 00:35:28,538
Just marinade on it.

619
00:35:30,007 --> 00:35:31,642
In the meantime, fuck off.

620
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,315
Oh, I bet Mickey was pleased he
took that meeting, wasn't he?

621
00:35:39,449 --> 00:35:41,719
Yes, it went very well.

622
00:35:41,852 --> 00:35:43,888
- Yeah.
- Do you want the top or the bottom?

623
00:35:44,354 --> 00:35:45,990
The bottom, please, darling.

624
00:35:46,824 --> 00:35:49,459
Now, things started to unravel
after that meeting.

625
00:35:49,593 --> 00:35:52,495
Didn't Mickey get a rat
infestation at one of his farms?

626
00:35:58,736 --> 00:35:59,937
Come on.

627
00:36:01,337 --> 00:36:02,405
Stealth, stealth.

628
00:36:03,874 --> 00:36:04,909
Go.

629
00:36:07,178 --> 00:36:08,511
Ballys down.

630
00:36:11,481 --> 00:36:13,416
Let's move. Go, go, go, go.

631
00:36:16,219 --> 00:36:17,220
Shit.

632
00:36:18,889 --> 00:36:21,692
Oh, my days.

633
00:36:22,258 --> 00:36:23,728
Fucking hell.

634
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,696
He said
there'd be a bit of puff.

635
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,297
Yeah, they weren't joking.

636
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:31,501
Oi, fellas.
It's already packed.

637
00:36:31,635 --> 00:36:32,837
Let's not mess about.

638
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,270
Let's load it up, boys.

639
00:36:35,072 --> 00:36:36,406
Who the fuck are you lot?

640
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:38,341
Fuck. Cover up.

641
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:40,276
Do you know
who owns this gaff?

642
00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:41,979
We don't give a fuck.

643
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:44,014
I think you got off
on the wrong stop.

644
00:36:45,015 --> 00:36:46,349
Oi, Tezza!

645
00:36:46,483 --> 00:36:48,886
- What?
- Fancy a row?

646
00:36:51,021 --> 00:36:52,288
Who are these jokers?

647
00:36:52,422 --> 00:36:53,758
They want our gear.

648
00:36:54,424 --> 00:36:55,525
Marv!

649
00:36:56,526 --> 00:36:57,628
Who's this cunt?

650
00:36:58,195 --> 00:36:59,329
John!

651
00:37:00,396 --> 00:37:02,465
Oh, hello.
It's Dad's Army.

652
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,934
Oi, Frank.

653
00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:07,270
What's this?
Teddy bears' picnic?

654
00:37:07,403 --> 00:37:08,973
Oi, Mo!

655
00:37:10,406 --> 00:37:12,275
Any more rabbits
in that warren?

656
00:37:12,408 --> 00:37:13,577
You lads fancy a warm-up?

657
00:37:13,711 --> 00:37:14,912
Not for you Jelly Babies.

658
00:37:15,045 --> 00:37:16,247
On three, lads.

659
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:17,815
Three.

660
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,018
Hey!

661
00:37:21,152 --> 00:37:22,920
What? You wanna
call him back, Granddad?

662
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:25,022
Fuck!

663
00:37:25,623 --> 00:37:26,924
Boss, let me get
two burgers on the stove.

664
00:37:27,057 --> 00:37:28,125
Get that quick, understand?

665
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:30,060
And I want two chips as well.

666
00:37:30,194 --> 00:37:32,163
What is this smell
of wee in here?

667
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,066
Who the fuck
is this joke, man?

668
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,802
Don't stand near me, son.

669
00:37:38,602 --> 00:37:41,172
You got your mouthwash
muddled up with cat piss.

670
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:44,474
Take two steps back
and wait your turn.

671
00:37:47,077 --> 00:37:49,345
You better fuck off, old man,
or I'll wet you.

672
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:51,582
The only thing you can wet's
your underpants, son.

673
00:37:51,882 --> 00:37:53,184
Now, back two steps.

674
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:56,419
Trigger. That's you. Go on.

675
00:37:56,553 --> 00:37:58,189
- That's you. You're up, bruv.
- Yeah?

676
00:37:58,321 --> 00:37:59,990
Do him. Fucking do him, lad.

677
00:38:00,124 --> 00:38:02,358
Stick it in him, bruv.

678
00:38:02,492 --> 00:38:04,527
Now, if you're gonna stab,
stab, Trigger.

679
00:38:04,662 --> 00:38:07,463
Don't, you know, dance.

680
00:38:07,598 --> 00:38:09,800
What are yous, like a Four
Tops tribute act or something?

681
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:12,069
The Foreskins. The Redskins.

682
00:38:12,203 --> 00:38:13,971
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Here come the Indians.

683
00:38:14,104 --> 00:38:16,574
Bit of the old Northern Soul,
is it, boys?

684
00:38:16,707 --> 00:38:19,210
Putting the gay
back in Marvin Gaye.

685
00:38:19,342 --> 00:38:21,812
I'm on fire over here, lads. Come on,
I need some back and forth. Come on.

686
00:38:21,946 --> 00:38:24,514
What have you got for me?
Now, make it quick. Make it funny.

687
00:38:25,182 --> 00:38:27,151
Fuck you.

688
00:38:27,852 --> 00:38:30,420
Jeez, that's disappointing.
No, no, not that.

689
00:38:30,955 --> 00:38:32,756
Go again. Go again.

690
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,458
Now, make it sharp.
Cut me with it.

691
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:37,194
- Fucking do him, laddie.
- Come on.

692
00:38:37,328 --> 00:38:38,996
Yeah. Yeah.

693
00:38:39,129 --> 00:38:40,496
Oh, shit!

694
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:41,832
Come on then, you dickhead.

695
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:45,236
My eyes!

696
00:38:45,836 --> 00:38:47,638
Yous are embarrassing
yourself here, lads.

697
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:51,208
Kids stab, girls shoot,
boys punch.

698
00:38:51,342 --> 00:38:54,311
Grown-ups fight with their heads.
That's where the real battle is.

699
00:38:54,444 --> 00:38:56,046
Up here, in the gray.

700
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,715
He sparked me out, bruv.

701
00:38:58,015 --> 00:39:00,584
Now, wake up, lads.
Life's quick, you're slow.

702
00:39:00,718 --> 00:39:02,418
Life's hard on a bone top.

703
00:39:03,354 --> 00:39:05,789
Come on down the gym.
We'll see what we can do with yous.

704
00:39:08,025 --> 00:39:11,195
Hang on.
Are you the coach?

705
00:39:15,866 --> 00:39:17,368
Coach, it's Ernie.

706
00:39:17,935 --> 00:39:21,238
Shit. It's the fucking coach,
bro. It's the fucking coach.

707
00:39:21,372 --> 00:39:22,973
Ernie, what is it?

708
00:39:23,107 --> 00:39:24,642
<i>Ball's in the back of the net.</i>

709
00:39:25,576 --> 00:39:28,746
We've rung the bell here and we're gonna
include you, because you're our mentor.

710
00:39:28,879 --> 00:39:31,547
I don't know what you're talking about,
but I don't like the sound of it.

711
00:39:31,682 --> 00:39:35,386
- We've landed a load of sticky bush.
- <i>Listen to me, now, Ernie.</i>

712
00:39:35,518 --> 00:39:37,453
Walk away.

713
00:39:37,588 --> 00:39:39,657
It's too late. We're at
the gym now unloading the van.

714
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,025
You took my van?

715
00:39:41,692 --> 00:39:43,761
Wait there.
I'll be back in ten minutes.

716
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,364
I'm sorry to intrude,
but I think you need to see this, boss.

you do to your nose?

You have a fight
in a week, man.

750
00:41:06,777 --> 00:41:08,012
Looks a lot worse
than what it is.

751
00:41:08,145 --> 00:41:09,680
- I'm a hundred percent.
- Yeah?

752

Is that what I think it is?

762
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:42,146
Yeah,
but the best version of it.

763
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:44,081
Tell me you didn't put
that fight porn online.

764
00:41:44,214 --> 00:41:46,483
It's white hot, Coach.
The hits.

765
00:41:46,617 --> 00:41:47,985
It's gone
intergalactic.

766
00:41:48,118 --> 00:41:49,486
What was I thinking,

767
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,588
leaving you kids alone
unsupervised?

768
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:55,325
Take it down. Now!

769
00:41:55,459 --> 00:41:57,728
I've gotta say,
I was impressed.

770
00:41:57,861 --> 00:42:00,831
The way they fought?
They're on point, guvnor.

771
00:42:01,298 --> 00:42:03,500
Whoever trained them
knows what he's doing.

772
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:04,935
Thank you.
That's enough.

773
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:07,104
- Well, I'm just saying.
- Well, quit saying.

774
00:42:07,237 --> 00:42:08,705
Okay, thank you.

775
00:42:09,506 --> 00:42:12,443
No sooner do I entertain
Matthew's offer to buy me out

776
00:42:12,576 --> 00:42:14,645
and reject Dry Eye's offer

777
00:42:15,345 --> 00:42:16,480
does one of my farms
get raided.

778
00:42:16,613 --> 00:42:18,082
First time ever.

779
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:20,050
Doesn't feel like
a coincidence, does it?

780
00:42:20,184 --> 00:42:22,252
It isn't.
There's fuckery afoot.

781
00:42:23,187 --> 00:42:25,489
- How did they find it?
- I don't know.

782
00:42:25,622 --> 00:42:26,890
I'm making inquiries.

783
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:29,760
What about Matthew?

784
00:42:29,893 --> 00:42:31,228
He's gonna need reassuring

785
00:42:31,361 --> 00:42:32,963
before he parts
with 400 big ones.

786
00:42:33,097 --> 00:42:34,998
So many questions
unanswered, Ray.

787
00:42:35,132 --> 00:42:38,902
I mean, who'd be smart enough
to find one of Mickey's farms?

788
00:42:39,036 --> 00:42:40,104
Apart from me, of course.

789
00:42:40,971 --> 00:42:44,908
<i>And who would be bold enough
to make such a move?</i>

790
00:42:45,042 --> 00:42:47,945
<i>Especially to film it all
and then post it all online?</i>

791
00:42:48,078 --> 00:42:51,648
Because that is really rubbing
your face in it, isn't it?

792
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:53,617
<i>I'm here to help, Michael.</i>

793
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:56,220
I'm your friend, your ally,

794
00:42:56,353 --> 00:42:58,288
your Santa Claus
for all seasons,

795
00:42:58,422 --> 00:43:02,226
and I'd like you to know my team
of elves can be very persuasive.

796
00:43:02,626 --> 00:43:06,330
Persuasive? And why
would I need persuasive?

797
00:43:06,463 --> 00:43:09,833
Well, I hear you might have
had a little trouble.

798
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:12,769
Now, you helped me before
when my source ran dry,

799
00:43:12,903 --> 00:43:15,339
so I'm just returning
the favor and reminding you

800
00:43:15,472 --> 00:43:17,040
I have effectual friends.

801
00:43:17,174 --> 00:43:18,442
Elves?

802
00:43:19,009 --> 00:43:20,277
Elves?

803
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,180
- Yes. You said elves.
- Did I?

804
00:43:23,313 --> 00:43:24,348
Mm.

805
00:43:25,115 --> 00:43:28,620
No trouble over here, Matthew.
No trouble at all.

806
00:43:31,355 --> 00:43:32,756
So we brought you
a token.

807
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:34,024
You did?

808
00:43:35,792 --> 00:43:39,496
And what might this be?

809
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:43,033
It's a paperweight to keep down all
the paper I'm about to give you.

810
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:46,103
- Well, it looks like a gun.
- And it's a paperweight.

811
00:43:46,236 --> 00:43:50,541
Seeing how in this country,
unlike in our homeland, they're illegal.

812
00:43:50,674 --> 00:43:53,277
So is riding your bicycle
at night without lights.

813
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:55,012
Laws are there
as a guideline.

814
00:43:55,145 --> 00:43:57,781
In France, it's illegal
to call a pig Napoleon,

815
00:43:57,915 --> 00:43:59,283
but just try and stop me.

816
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:03,453
I quite like it.
You're very kind.

817
00:44:03,588 --> 00:44:06,123
- Thank you.
- Hands across the sea.

818
00:44:06,256 --> 00:44:08,292
<i>Mickey calmed down the Jew</i>

819
00:44:08,425 --> 00:44:10,027
<i>and it seems the deal
is still going ahead.</i>

820
00:44:10,494 --> 00:44:14,064
<i>But bad timing, jeopardizing
deals, shutting down farms.</i>

821
00:44:14,198 --> 00:44:18,235
<i>It could be an expensive disaster if
Mickey doesn't get this cleaned up.</i>

822
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,437
Should I be scared?

823
00:44:21,738 --> 00:44:25,275
I don't think so,
but I like to err on the side of caution.

824
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:26,910
What does that mean?

825
00:44:27,044 --> 00:44:28,912
It means I'm going to
have to close shop,

826
00:44:29,046 --> 00:44:32,115
shut this farm down
and make it disappear.

827
00:44:32,549 --> 00:44:34,017
You might see
a couple of trucks around here

828
00:44:34,151 --> 00:44:35,886
over the next few days,
but that's it.

829
00:44:36,019 --> 00:44:38,121
Well, I'm not gonna pretend
that missing out

830
00:44:38,255 --> 00:44:41,291
on a million pounds commission a
year isn't going to hurt somewhat.

831
00:44:41,425 --> 00:44:43,026
The pain is being shared.

832
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,563
Stolen product,
loss of earnings meantime,

833
00:44:46,698 --> 00:44:49,766
the cost of shutting down,
the expense of setting up elsewhere.

834
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,369
It's funny, really, but
it couldn't be worse timing.

835
00:44:52,704 --> 00:44:54,004
How so?

836
00:44:54,137 --> 00:44:55,372
I've...

837
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,842
I've just learned we need
a whole new roof apparently.

838
00:44:58,976 --> 00:45:02,279
As I say, I'm as upset
about this as you are.

839
00:45:06,883 --> 00:45:08,952
- Henry.
- Mickey.

840
00:45:09,687 --> 00:45:13,523
<i>The toffs look after Mickey.
Now Mickey looks after the toffs.</i>

841
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:16,728
<i>But there's a lot of toffs
to look after.</i>

842
00:45:17,561 --> 00:45:19,563
- Henry.
<i>- And when it rains...</i>

843
00:45:19,697 --> 00:45:21,098
Let me take care of the roof.

844
00:45:21,231 --> 00:45:23,467
<i>...it fucking pours.</i>

845
00:45:23,967 --> 00:45:27,004
<i>Now, there's only one thing that
needs more looking after than a toff,</i>

846
00:45:27,137 --> 00:45:29,607
<i>and that is
a toff's offspring.</i>

847
00:45:29,741 --> 00:45:33,010
<i>Which brings me neatly back
to Big Dave's story,</i>

848
00:45:33,143 --> 00:45:35,647
<i>the very reason I'm sitting
here sipping whiskey with you</i>

849
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:37,514
<i>in the first fucking place.</i>

850
00:45:37,649 --> 00:45:41,184
<i>This is how Big Dave
is gonna bring Mickey down,</i>

851
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:45,489
<i>by using and abusing Lord
Pressfield's much-beloved child.</i>

852
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:50,427
Lord Pressfield's daughter, the famous and
talented Laura, all self-hate and harm,

853
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,830
has fallen for this Power
Noel's smacked-out dark charm,

854
00:45:53,964 --> 00:45:55,633
and I want the lot of them,

855
00:45:56,199 --> 00:45:59,002
especially that
slimy little jam rag Pearson,

856
00:45:59,136 --> 00:46:01,673
in bed with a skint,
discredited toff,

857
00:46:01,805 --> 00:46:05,509
and supplying gear to young
and reckless rock-star royals,

858
00:46:05,643 --> 00:46:07,911
royals unbridled
by distracted parents

859
00:46:08,045 --> 00:46:10,113
too busy skiing
on the Swiss Alps to notice

860
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:11,982
and too fucking stupid
to care.

861
00:46:12,115 --> 00:46:14,818
I like it.
You're good at this, boss.

862
00:46:14,951 --> 00:46:16,953
Yeah, I know what I'm good at,
Hammy. Fuck off.

863
00:46:17,954 --> 00:46:22,526
<i>Aristocratic, junkie, bulimic,
auto-tuned singing daughter</i>

864
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,195
<i>shacked up with some smacked-out,
once-upon-a-time pop star,</i>

865
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:26,997
<i>and all looked after
by Mickey Pearson.</i>

866
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:30,133
I like it.
You know, I like it a lot.

867
00:46:30,834 --> 00:46:32,502
We wrapped her
in cotton wool.

868
00:46:32,637 --> 00:46:34,538
But she was
our little Lor-la.

869
00:46:36,073 --> 00:46:38,942
Charlie called her that because
she couldn't say Laura at first.

870
00:46:39,644 --> 00:46:41,345
We miss her terribly, Mickey.

871
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:44,047
I've failed as a parent.

872
00:46:44,181 --> 00:46:46,249
You mustn't keep
beating yourself up, dear.

873
00:46:46,383 --> 00:46:49,252
Anne's right, Charles.
You mustn't blame yourselves.

874
00:46:49,386 --> 00:46:51,288
It sounds as though Laura
fell in with the wrong crowd

875
00:46:51,421 --> 00:46:53,890
at a time when she was
particularly vulnerable.

876
00:46:54,024 --> 00:46:55,626
What more
could we do?

877
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:58,562
It's happened
to so many of our friends.

878
00:46:58,696 --> 00:47:00,163
It's a curse.

879
00:47:01,498 --> 00:47:04,034
- Do you mind if I look into it?
- So you'll help us?

880
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,204
Let me see what I can do.

881
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:13,578
You should get yourself
one of these, boss.

882
00:47:13,711 --> 00:47:15,345
Well, that's the plan.

883
00:47:15,479 --> 00:47:16,980
Everything all right?

884
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:18,816
You remember
their daughter?

885
00:47:18,949 --> 00:47:20,884
Yeah, Laura.
Nice girl. Good voice.

886
00:47:21,017 --> 00:47:24,554
Teeny sort of spunk-funk fuck pop.
Shame about the habit.

887
00:47:24,689 --> 00:47:27,958
She's gone missing. They've asked
us to find her, bring her home.

888
00:47:28,492 --> 00:47:29,459
Mm-hmm.

889
00:47:30,193 --> 00:47:31,696
Is that a problem?

890
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:33,430
Well, I had a feeling
you might ask me this, boss,

891
00:47:33,563 --> 00:47:35,132
so I did some due diligence.

892
00:47:35,265 --> 00:47:36,967
I know where she is
and I don't like it.

893
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,403
- I'd rather we didn't get involved.
- Why not?

894
00:47:39,903 --> 00:47:41,905
<i>She's on
a South London council estate.</i>

895
00:47:42,038 --> 00:47:44,307
- <i>So?</i>
- It's out of our jurisdiction.

896
00:47:44,709 --> 00:47:46,744
There's too many moving parts,
parts that we can't control.

897
00:47:46,878 --> 00:47:48,713
What if she doesn't wanna come?
It's gonna get messy.

898
00:47:48,846 --> 00:47:51,548
Well, that may be true,
but you're still doing it.

899
00:47:52,583 --> 00:47:53,917
I accept that.

900
00:47:55,085 --> 00:47:56,453
But can't you
send Frazier instead?

901
00:47:56,587 --> 00:47:58,288
No, I can't
send Frazier instead.

902
00:47:58,422 --> 00:47:59,757
You're my best man.
I want you.

903
00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:07,931
It's just that
I don't like smackies.

904
00:48:08,064 --> 00:48:10,100
It's the filth and the grime
and the grub in the tub.

905
00:48:10,233 --> 00:48:13,136
I'm not asking your OCD to spend
the weekend with them, Ray.

906
00:48:14,739 --> 00:48:16,306
Think of it
as philanthropy.

907
00:48:17,775 --> 00:48:19,142
Come on,
you're driving.

908
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,479
No good deed
goes unpunished.

909
00:48:22,613 --> 00:48:26,684
And this is where you
have your moment, isn't it, Raymondo?

910
00:48:26,818 --> 00:48:28,485
This is where
you step on stage

911
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:30,954
and set the dominoes flying
every-fucking-where.

912
00:48:32,088 --> 00:48:33,356
Meaning what?

913
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,027
Meaning no good deed
goes unpunished.

914
00:48:37,461 --> 00:48:38,830
Knock, knock-knock,
knock, knock.

915
00:48:48,004 --> 00:48:49,306
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

916
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,208
Wrong door.

917
00:48:51,341 --> 00:48:52,509
Ah, ah, ah.

918
00:48:53,678 --> 00:48:57,080
My name is Raymond Smith.

919
00:48:58,081 --> 00:49:00,116
Can I step inside
for a moment, please?

920
00:49:06,556 --> 00:49:08,091
How can I help you,
Officer?

921
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:12,362
I'm not the police. No, I just
need a moment of your time.

922
00:49:12,496 --> 00:49:14,498
It's about Laura Pressfield.

923
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,434
I don't know anyone
of that name.

924
00:49:18,235 --> 00:49:20,537
It would be much easier
for all parties concerned

925
00:49:20,671 --> 00:49:22,807
if I could just step inside
for a moment.

926
00:49:23,574 --> 00:49:24,809
No, fuck off.

927
00:49:24,942 --> 00:49:26,777
Jeez.

928
00:49:27,344 --> 00:49:28,813
That's a nice whip, bruv.

929
00:49:29,279 --> 00:49:31,481
Killer motor. It's a shame
about them rims, though.

930
00:49:31,616 --> 00:49:32,917
Yeah, lend us the keys.

931
00:49:33,049 --> 00:49:34,886
Put some chrome twenty-twos
on that.

932
00:49:35,018 --> 00:49:37,387
Hey, my man's got the Dessies
and the bootcuts, you know.

933
00:49:37,521 --> 00:49:39,222
Deffo linking a jessie.

934
00:49:54,005 --> 00:49:55,338
What the fuck?

935
00:50:00,845 --> 00:50:03,380
- What are you doing here?
- Now, now, now.

936
00:50:04,114 --> 00:50:06,684
- Get the fuck out.
- Now, now, now.

937
00:50:12,122 --> 00:50:14,190
As you was, boys and girls.

938
00:50:25,302 --> 00:50:26,571
Sit down.

939
00:50:31,541 --> 00:50:32,743
Thank you.

940
00:50:37,447 --> 00:50:39,549
Shall we have
a little bit of fresh air?

941
00:50:44,755 --> 00:50:46,891
Who the fuck
are your mates, Brown?

942
00:50:47,024 --> 00:50:50,728
No need to get excited, young man.
We will be gone in a few moments.

943
00:50:50,861 --> 00:50:53,430
No, no, no, you'll be gone before then.
Get the fuck out now.

944
00:50:56,601 --> 00:50:58,803
I can be dangerous if I want to be.
Get the fuck out now.

945
00:50:58,936 --> 00:51:02,707
Sit down, Power,
before you get yourself into more trouble.

946
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,241
How d'you know my name? How
the fuck does he know my name?

947
00:51:05,375 --> 00:51:06,978
I know all your names.

948
00:51:07,678 --> 00:51:10,915
Apart from
that little anomaly.

949
00:51:11,782 --> 00:51:13,751
I know where
you went to school.

950
00:51:14,752 --> 00:51:16,721
I know who your parents are.

951
00:51:16,854 --> 00:51:21,391
And I know you'll suck a
cock for a five-pound bag.

952
00:51:25,462 --> 00:51:26,897
Now sit.

953
00:51:35,806 --> 00:51:38,809
Just so we're clear,
I work for a man,

954
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:41,112
a powerful man.

955
00:51:41,478 --> 00:51:42,445
Michael Pearson.

956
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,147
Ten points to you, Laura.

957
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,616
Who's Michael Pearson?

958
00:51:45,983 --> 00:51:49,152
Friend of her father's.
Runs London's puff game.

959
00:51:49,285 --> 00:51:50,621
A big dick swinger.

960
00:51:51,088 --> 00:51:52,455
What is your name,
young man?

961
00:51:53,423 --> 00:51:55,660
- Aslan.
- And where are you from, Aslan?

962
00:51:55,793 --> 00:51:57,728
You don't sound like
one of the natives.

963
00:51:58,328 --> 00:51:59,529
Disneyland.

964
00:51:59,664 --> 00:52:01,231
Sounds about right.

965
00:52:01,766 --> 00:52:03,500
Well, you are correct.
He is a big dick swinger.

966
00:52:03,634 --> 00:52:05,970
But I wouldn't want him
to hear you say that.

967
00:52:06,103 --> 00:52:09,840
It's best you forget what he apparently
does for a living after we depart.

968
00:52:10,675 --> 00:52:14,045
Now, Laura, your father's
asked us to bring you home.

969
00:52:14,177 --> 00:52:15,478
She's not going anywhere.

970
00:52:24,855 --> 00:52:26,123
Do you mind if I sit?

971
00:52:26,256 --> 00:52:27,490
Yes.

972
00:52:37,467 --> 00:52:42,707
I don't build a joint like
the Americans and the new school...

973
00:52:43,406 --> 00:52:47,178
back-strapping, jockstrapping,
coke-wrapping, and all that bollocks.

974
00:52:47,712 --> 00:52:50,681
I like a good old-fashioned
50-50 mix, me.

975
00:52:51,148 --> 00:52:52,616
That's how we used to play.

976
00:52:53,216 --> 00:52:55,019
If there's one thing
I will never understand,

977
00:52:55,152 --> 00:52:57,253
it's why you lot
get addicted to heroin.

978
00:52:57,855 --> 00:53:01,692
If there's one drug you should not
chase, it is the dirty dragon.

979
00:53:02,593 --> 00:53:04,128
Did you ever
give it a spin, Bunny?

980
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,098
No, not me, Ray.
I don't even puff anymore.

981
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:11,267
Of course not. Bunny likes the gym.
You can probably see that.

982
00:53:12,169 --> 00:53:15,106
- What are you benching these days?
- Three wheels a side.

983
00:53:16,006 --> 00:53:17,208
What about you, Brown?

984
00:53:17,641 --> 00:53:20,845
- What about me?
- What could I lift?

985
00:53:21,511 --> 00:53:24,215
You couldn't lift
a wheel of cheese, you cunt.

986
00:53:27,685 --> 00:53:28,919
Now...

987
00:53:30,821 --> 00:53:32,723
if you wanna be naughty,

988
00:53:32,857 --> 00:53:35,893
what happened to a little smoke
and a poke and a glass of wine,

989
00:53:36,026 --> 00:53:38,261
some Barry White,
candles around the bath

990
00:53:38,394 --> 00:53:39,930
and put your finger
in the missus?

991
00:53:40,731 --> 00:53:42,166
Who's Barry White?

992
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,235
Big black geezer.

993
00:53:44,367 --> 00:53:45,636
Sexy voice.

994
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:47,571
I'm... I'm lost.

995
00:53:47,705 --> 00:53:51,407
Am I in the bath with Barry
White's finger in my missus?

996
00:53:51,809 --> 00:53:55,913
Be quiet, Brown. You were lost
long before Barry White walked in.

997
00:54:07,825 --> 00:54:09,760
If you lot are unhappy,

998
00:54:09,894 --> 00:54:12,428
you should share your thoughts
with your friends.

999
00:54:13,063 --> 00:54:16,299
Nice friends. Talk it out,
find a positive solution.

1000
00:54:16,901 --> 00:54:20,971
But, no,
all you lot choose squalor.

1001
00:54:21,939 --> 00:54:24,474
Drowning in
your liberal white guilt.

1002
00:54:25,542 --> 00:54:27,244
Sorry,
what am I guilty of?

1003
00:54:27,377 --> 00:54:29,445
Being a cunt, Brown.

1004
00:54:30,781 --> 00:54:32,315
Being a cunt.

1005
00:54:33,784 --> 00:54:35,786
Anyway, I'm not your shrink.

1006
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,122
I'm just trying to radiate
some positive vibes man to man.

1007
00:54:38,255 --> 00:54:40,791
I mean, that's what this puff
game used to be all about.

1008
00:54:44,261 --> 00:54:45,629
Anyway...

1009
00:54:47,798 --> 00:54:49,033
back to you, Laura,

1010
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:52,335
queen in this here
kingdom of shit.

1011
00:54:52,937 --> 00:54:56,807
A single rose
in a cauldron of thorns.

1012
00:54:58,541 --> 00:55:00,177
Are you ready
to turn the corner?

1013
00:55:01,178 --> 00:55:03,346
Open the curtains
and let the light in?

1014
00:55:03,814 --> 00:55:06,717
Do your mum and dad a favor
and try the impossible,

1015
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:09,153
make yourself happy.

1016
00:55:15,458 --> 00:55:16,492
All right.

1017
00:55:17,194 --> 00:55:19,395
Fucking hell.
That was easy.

1018
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:22,132
All right, fantastic.

1019
00:55:22,266 --> 00:55:23,868
Well, in that case, Bunny,

1020
00:55:24,001 --> 00:55:26,136
will you help Laura
with her things, please?

1021
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:28,005
Incoming.

1022
00:55:28,138 --> 00:55:30,040
It's all right, Bunny.
I don't really have anything.

1023
00:55:36,512 --> 00:55:38,215
It's a shithole anyway.

1024
00:55:41,585 --> 00:55:42,920
Don't go. Please, wait!

1025
00:55:45,823 --> 00:55:47,057
Sit down!

1026
00:55:49,026 --> 00:55:52,096
Touch me again,
I'll cut your fucking arm off.

1027
00:55:55,332 --> 00:55:57,368
It's all right, Bunny.
Keep going.

1028
00:55:58,669 --> 00:56:02,039
I just will not be
manhandled by a junkie cunt.

1029
00:56:06,343 --> 00:56:10,915
Dave, keep the kids in
school for one minute.

1030
00:56:15,319 --> 00:56:17,187
My man
probably wants to buy weed.

1031
00:56:17,321 --> 00:56:20,291
- What, da Loud Pack, boss?
- Or the Purple Haze then.

1032
00:56:20,423 --> 00:56:22,425
My man just pulled out
a donkey choker, bruv.

1033
00:56:22,558 --> 00:56:24,094
Keep your puff.

1034
00:56:24,762 --> 00:56:28,531
Buy yourself a sticky book
and a packet of sweets.

1035
00:56:28,666 --> 00:56:29,767
All-in!

1036
00:56:31,068 --> 00:56:32,303
Now, now, now.

1037
00:56:34,504 --> 00:56:36,040
You cunt.

1038
00:56:36,674 --> 00:56:38,242
Fuck you!

1039
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:41,078
Hey, that is
a naughty kettle, bruv.

1040
00:56:41,211 --> 00:56:42,478
Hey, what's the time,
Mr. Wolf?

1041
00:56:42,613 --> 00:56:46,583
It's time for you
to fuck off, lads.

1042
00:56:46,717 --> 00:56:49,253
Fucking hit him, Brown!

1043
00:56:52,555 --> 00:56:55,059
Ah. He's bought you a gun.

1044
00:56:55,192 --> 00:56:57,194
That's a nice little gift.

1045
00:56:57,328 --> 00:56:59,596
Five years in prison
all in one little box.

1046
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:02,599
Oh, but that's not a gun,
dear. That's a paperweight.

1047
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:06,870
Course it is, along with a
family of six baby bullets.

1048
00:57:08,072 --> 00:57:09,606
Guess we'll have to
get rid of that.

1049
00:57:10,607 --> 00:57:12,643
- Hello, Ray.
- Rosalind.

1050
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:14,311
Sorry for the interruption.

1051
00:57:14,445 --> 00:57:15,946
What do you need, Ray?

1052
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,582
Laura Pressfield
has been returned home safely.

1053
00:57:25,322 --> 00:57:26,457
Good.

1054
00:57:28,993 --> 00:57:30,127
What else?

1055
00:57:31,161 --> 00:57:33,197
One of her associates
had an accident.

1056
00:57:34,564 --> 00:57:37,034
- Shit.
- He fell out of a window, boss.

1057
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:38,501
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

1058
00:57:38,635 --> 00:57:42,139
It's time for you
to fuck off, lads.

1059
00:57:44,274 --> 00:57:45,508
Oh, shit.

1060
00:57:45,642 --> 00:57:47,244
Sounds like
quite an extreme accident.

1061
00:57:47,378 --> 00:57:49,580
Yeah, it was more like
a death, really.

1062
00:57:51,215 --> 00:57:53,250
- Oh, shit.
- Selfie, bruv!

1063
00:57:53,384 --> 00:57:54,517
So you killed someone?

1064
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:57,187
No. It was the gravity
that killed him.

1065
00:57:58,222 --> 00:57:59,757
- Who was he?
- Aslan.

1066
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:02,192
Some Russian kid
with tracks on his arms.

1067
00:58:02,326 --> 00:58:04,094
Russian kid?
That doesn't sound good.

1068
00:58:04,228 --> 00:58:05,262
Anyone see you?

1069
00:58:05,396 --> 00:58:07,064
Little selfie? Selfie, bruv?

1070
00:58:07,197 --> 00:58:08,365
Shit.

1071
00:58:08,732 --> 00:58:10,768
Nothing was recorded.
We left it clean.

1072
00:58:11,035 --> 00:58:13,404
- The body?
- I've dealt with that.

1073
00:58:15,139 --> 00:58:17,674
- This is not ideal.
- It is not.

1074
00:58:18,342 --> 00:58:20,878
<i>You can't be fooled
by how those junkies dress.</i>

1075
00:58:21,512 --> 00:58:24,648
- <i>They went to schools, expensive schools.</i>
- Aslan.

1076
00:58:24,782 --> 00:58:27,217
<i>Their parents
have money, lots of money.</i>

1077
00:58:28,385 --> 00:58:30,387
And money can be a problem.

1078
00:58:31,889 --> 00:58:33,390
Shit.

1079
00:58:33,524 --> 00:58:36,260
I bet you told Mickey nothing
about what happened.

1080
00:58:36,794 --> 00:58:39,997
You're fishing, Fletcher,
because you've got no idea.

1081
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:43,000
You're right, I am fishing.

1082
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:47,204
Look at this. I'm fishing
in my little baggie.

1083
00:58:48,238 --> 00:58:49,706
And what have I found?

1084
00:58:51,341 --> 00:58:52,409
Oh.

1085
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,812
Thank you.
Or should I say...

1086
00:58:55,712 --> 00:58:56,747
<i>spasibo?</i>

1087
00:58:57,114 --> 00:58:58,549
What's that young man
doing?

1088
00:58:58,682 --> 00:59:00,517
Is he looking for
something on the floor?

1089
00:59:01,018 --> 00:59:02,419
Frazier.

1090
00:59:03,053 --> 00:59:05,556
Lads, we're gonna
need those phones.

1091
00:59:06,223 --> 00:59:07,991
Hey, run. Move, bruv. Move.

1092
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:10,394
Bunny, get him.
Fucking clean that up.

1093
00:59:10,894 --> 00:59:13,430
- Come on then, catch me, dickhead.
- Little cunt.

Now I've got backup.

1099
00:59:48,866 --> 00:59:50,968
You couldn't back up
a phone, you cunt.

1100
00:59:51,335 --> 00:59:53,270
Bruv, this guy's trying
to take my phone.

1101
00:59:53,403 --> 00:59:55,839
- Fucking do him.
- Back the fuck up!

1102
00:59:55,973 --> 00:59:57,174
How you gonna talk your way
out of this one, mate?

1103
00:59:57,307 --> 00:59:58,775
Easy, lads.

1104
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:03,714
I'm sure you're all
roadmen, gangsters,

1105
01:00:03,847 --> 01:00:07,117
proper naughty boys
and all that bollocks.

1106
01:00:08,352 --> 01:00:10,554
But I come in peace.

1107
01:00:12,322 --> 01:00:15,359
I'm not trying to steal it.
I'm trying to buy it.

1108
01:00:16,693 --> 01:00:19,530
For good money.
Honest money.

1109
01:00:20,697 --> 01:00:22,432
Yeah? What, this phone?

1110
01:00:24,968 --> 01:00:27,704
- How much?
- A full bag.

1111
01:00:28,606 --> 01:00:32,342
Then I'll be gone,
like the darkness at dawn.

1112
01:00:33,177 --> 01:00:36,146
How about you give us that bag
and be gone anyway?

1113
01:00:43,153 --> 01:00:45,022
Stop fucking around, cunt.

1114
01:00:47,457 --> 01:00:51,361
Give me the phone
and take the money.

1115
01:00:51,995 --> 01:00:54,164
Drop the fucking money
and run, boy.

1116
01:01:01,705 --> 01:01:02,739
Right.

1117
01:01:04,676 --> 01:01:07,579
- Fuck!
- Move, move, move!

1118
01:01:09,313 --> 01:01:10,414
Now...

1119
01:01:11,848 --> 01:01:16,386
put the phone on the ground.

1120
01:01:25,562 --> 01:01:27,898

Fletcher, shoes off inside.

1128
01:01:55,593 --> 01:01:57,494
Leave them by the door.

1129
01:01:57,629 --> 01:01:59,129
Yes, Mommy.

1130
01:02:01,098 --> 01:02:03,133
Come on, bruv.
Where's your pace, brother?

1131
01:02:03,568 --> 01:02:05,135
You can do better than that.

1132
01:02:05,269 --> 01:02:06,470
Wanker.

1133
01:02:07,137 --> 01:02:09,273

stop fucking about.

Nearly there.
Nearly there. Nearly there.

1136
01:02:14,878 --> 01:02:17,481
Lift those legs up.
Come on, bro.

1137
01:02:17,615 --> 01:02:19,416
You should have brought
your running shoes today, bro.

1138
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:20,784
Trying out for the Olympics,
are we?

1139
01:02:21,118 --> 01:02:23,520
It's fucking Usain Bolt.
Come on, Usain.

1140
01:02:36,366 --> 01:02:37,401
Phone.

1141
01:02:46,644 --> 01:02:47,978
Sorry about that.

1142
01:02:50,547 --> 01:02:51,948
Can I go home now?

1143
01:02:52,082 --> 01:02:54,885
Course you can, darling.
Course you can.

1144
01:03:15,807 --> 01:03:16,973
Is there a problem here, Ray?

1145
01:03:17,107 --> 01:03:18,408
I don't know.

1146
01:03:19,543 --> 01:03:21,144
Is there a problem here,
Fletcher?

1147
01:03:22,045 --> 01:03:23,847
I see no problem at all.

1148
01:03:25,717 --> 01:03:27,484
I forgot to wash my hands.

1149
01:03:29,186 --> 01:03:30,655
Next time call first.

1150
01:03:30,788 --> 01:03:32,189
Sorry, guv.

1151
01:03:33,691 --> 01:03:35,525
And you haven't
heard a whisper?

1152
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:37,527
How can so much bush go missing
and nobody know nothing?

1153
01:03:37,662 --> 01:03:40,030
<i>Ah,
I've heard nothing, Coach, honestly.</i>

1154
01:03:40,163 --> 01:03:41,998
<i>Nothing on the street.
But you know what?</i>

1155
01:03:42,132 --> 01:03:44,000
<i>There is this geezer
called Mickey Pearson.</i>

1156
01:03:44,134 --> 01:03:46,203
- Who the fuck is Mickey Pearson?
- <i>Ah, you know him.</i>

1157
01:03:46,336 --> 01:03:48,238
<i>He runs the bush game.
He's a horrible cunt.</i>

1158
01:03:48,372 --> 01:03:50,407
<i>You don't wanna
step on his toes.</i>

1159
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:52,643
<i>But there's no way your lads
jimmied their way into his car,</i>

1160
01:03:52,777 --> 01:03:54,411
<i>so I wouldn't concern yourself
with that.</i>

1161
01:03:54,544 --> 01:03:56,213
All right, you know
where to find me, Chasa.

1162
01:03:56,346 --> 01:03:57,582
Keep your ear to the ground.

1163
01:03:57,715 --> 01:03:59,316
Primetime, in you get.

1164
01:04:01,051 --> 01:04:02,252
Ernie.

1165
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:04,888
Did you get
that Chinese fella's name?

1166
01:04:05,021 --> 01:04:06,123
- Phuc.
- What?

1167
01:04:06,256 --> 01:04:07,891
Phuc, like "fuck" with a "Ph."

1168
01:04:08,024 --> 01:04:10,360
Don't get street with me, Ernie.
Where does he live?

1169
01:04:10,494 --> 01:04:12,630
- Posh part of Croydon.
- Drop the rope.

1170
01:04:12,764 --> 01:04:14,398
There is no posh part
of Croydon.

1171
01:04:14,832 --> 01:04:18,603
- It's comparative, innit?
- Oi, Ernie, what are you doing?

1172
01:04:18,736 --> 01:04:20,237
Why aren't you training,
you black cunt?

1173
01:04:20,772 --> 01:04:22,038
I'm on my own here.

1174
01:04:24,207 --> 01:04:25,643
Did he just call me
a black cunt?

1175
01:04:26,076 --> 01:04:28,579
- Yes, he did.
- He can't do that. That's racist.

1176
01:04:28,713 --> 01:04:31,515
But, you are black and you are a
cunt, Ernie. Those are the facts.

1177
01:04:31,649 --> 01:04:33,517
I don't think Primetime cares
what race you run in.

1178
01:04:34,151 --> 01:04:36,621
The fact that I'm black has nothing
to do with the fact I'm a cunt.

1179
01:04:36,754 --> 01:04:38,955
He didn't say black people
were cunts, Ernie.

1180
01:04:39,089 --> 01:04:41,091
He was being specific to you.
One has nothing to do with the other.

1181
01:04:41,224 --> 01:04:42,794
And I'd go a step further,
if I'm not mistaken,

1182
01:04:42,926 --> 01:04:44,928
and say it was a term
of familiar affection.

1183
01:04:45,061 --> 01:04:47,732
Primetime's a Gypsy.
I wouldn't call him a pikey cunt.

1184
01:04:47,865 --> 01:04:49,867
Why not? He might be
very understanding.

1185
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,435
Only if it comes from
a place of love, of course.

1186
01:04:51,569 --> 01:04:53,203
Now, back to
the issue at hand.

1187
01:04:53,336 --> 01:04:55,439
I need that Chinese
geezer's address, okay?

1188
01:04:55,573 --> 01:04:57,140
You'll have it
by the morning, Coach.

1189
01:04:57,274 --> 01:04:59,109
- Good lad.
- And, Coach...

1190
01:04:59,242 --> 01:05:00,812
- What?
- I've got some good news.

1191
01:05:00,944 --> 01:05:03,280
- What?
- I found out whose weed we took.

1192
01:05:05,148 --> 01:05:07,117
And now
you fucking tell me!

1193
01:05:08,051 --> 01:05:09,453
Did I say stop?

1194
01:05:10,954 --> 01:05:13,624
Ernie, this is not
the fucking time

1195
01:05:13,758 --> 01:05:15,860
to keep your cards
close to your chest.

1196
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,029
Just tell me his name
isn't Mickey Pearson.

1197
01:05:19,162 --> 01:05:21,264
Blimey, Coach,
are you a Gypsy too?

1198
01:05:21,398 --> 01:05:23,033
You been reading tea leaves,
got a crystal ball?

1199
01:05:23,166 --> 01:05:25,302
That is not good news,
Ernie.

1200
01:05:25,435 --> 01:05:29,005
Mickey Pearson is terrible news in the
face of a violent and expensive debt.

1201
01:05:38,048 --> 01:05:39,483
I'm here
to see your boss.

1202
01:05:46,591 --> 01:05:48,024
Feel free to talk.

1203
01:05:48,659 --> 01:05:50,628
I gather you're the
consigliere of the outfit

1204
01:05:50,761 --> 01:05:53,430
that my boys were stupid
enough to fuck around with.

1205
01:05:54,665 --> 01:05:58,301
On that note, I'd like to extend
my apologies on their behalf.

1206
01:05:59,069 --> 01:06:00,671
My boys, they're naive,

1207
01:06:01,238 --> 01:06:03,273
they've had hard lives and they're
just starting to come good,

1208
01:06:03,406 --> 01:06:06,309
but they're my lads,
my responsibility,

1209
01:06:06,677 --> 01:06:08,846
so it's me that should be
accountable for their actions.

1210
01:06:09,379 --> 01:06:13,049
Now, I can return your goods,
but I can't return the inconvenience,

1211
01:06:13,183 --> 01:06:15,252
the time,
the fucking headache.

1212
01:06:16,152 --> 01:06:21,258
And so I offer you my loyalty,
my word, my time,

1213
01:06:21,692 --> 01:06:23,560
until that debt is settled.

1214
01:06:26,129 --> 01:06:30,233
I'll make amends,
but just leave me lads alone.

1215
01:06:32,302 --> 01:06:35,640
First of all, I'm gonna need to know
how your lads got the information

1216
01:06:35,773 --> 01:06:37,742
about where our farm
was sited,

1217
01:06:38,141 --> 01:06:39,911
'cause that's not
common knowledge.

1218
01:06:41,111 --> 01:06:45,315
Once we've overcome that little
challenge, then we can talk.

1219
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:49,587
Well, I can do
better than that.

1220
01:06:57,093 --> 01:07:00,530
His name is Phuc, but it's spelled with
a "Ph," so it sounds like "fu-uck."

1221
01:07:02,633 --> 01:07:04,200
So it's Phu-uc?

1222
01:07:04,334 --> 01:07:06,403
What?
Yeah, something like that.

1223
01:07:06,536 --> 01:07:10,373
Anyway, he's the kid that gave us
the skunk farm job. Do you know him?

1224
01:07:10,507 --> 01:07:13,410
Yeah, we've met before,
haven't we, Phu-uc... Phuc?

1225
01:07:13,543 --> 01:07:14,612
That's the one.
Phu-uc?

1226
01:07:14,745 --> 01:07:16,747
- Phuc.
- Phuc.

1227
01:07:18,248 --> 01:07:19,382
All right.

1228
01:07:19,884 --> 01:07:21,586
Don't do anything stupid, now,
son, right?

1229
01:07:24,554 --> 01:07:26,156
How did you know
the location?

1230
01:07:26,289 --> 01:07:27,792
I need my inhaler.

1231
01:07:27,925 --> 01:07:29,326
Yeah, in a minute.

1232
01:07:29,961 --> 01:07:33,096
I need you to tell me how you
knew the location of our farm.

1233
01:07:34,297 --> 01:07:37,768
I've been trailing you for months.
Dry Eye was given the address.

1234
01:07:38,736 --> 01:07:41,204
I can't breathe!
I need it, please.

1235
01:07:41,338 --> 01:07:44,240
All right, Phuc.
Calm the fu-uck down.

1236
01:07:46,777 --> 01:07:49,379
Right, here, steady yourself.
For fuck's sake.

1237
01:07:51,348 --> 01:07:52,750
Sort him out.

1238
01:07:53,383 --> 01:07:55,086
All right.

1239
01:07:56,553 --> 01:07:57,788
Here, here, look at me.

1240
01:07:58,455 --> 01:07:59,724
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1241
01:07:59,857 --> 01:08:01,491
- Where's your inhaler?
- There.

1242
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:05,261
Right, here, take a blim.

1243
01:08:05,395 --> 01:08:09,033
Now, good boy. There you go, son.
You all right?

1244
01:08:11,969 --> 01:08:13,004
Fuck!

1245
01:08:14,105 --> 01:08:15,171
No, stop, don't!

1246
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:25,983
Fuck's sake, Ray. You need
to invest in some parachutes.

1247
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:28,119
There's a pattern
emerging here.

1248
01:08:28,251 --> 01:08:29,620
I'm sorry, boss.

1249
01:08:29,754 --> 01:08:31,856
And who's this
jumping Phuc boy, anyway?

1250
01:08:31,989 --> 01:08:34,491
- It's Dry Eye's man.
- You mean Lord George's man.

1251
01:08:35,026 --> 01:08:38,561
It could just be Dry Eye's doing.
He's been getting bold lately.

1252
01:08:38,696 --> 01:08:42,033
Yeah. Well,
they still all work for Lord George.

1253
01:08:43,233 --> 01:08:44,935
I'm gonna take care
of this one myself.

1254
01:09:12,997 --> 01:09:14,098
Lord George.

1255
01:09:14,699 --> 01:09:16,067
Mr. Pearson.

1256
01:09:17,534 --> 01:09:19,036
And to what do I owe?

1257
01:09:30,881 --> 01:09:31,949
What you watching?

1258
01:09:33,249 --> 01:09:34,752
I'm watching the telly.

1259
01:09:35,318 --> 01:09:37,054
What you watching
on the telly?

1260
01:09:37,188 --> 01:09:39,690
I'm watching
the horse racing.

1261
01:09:40,157 --> 01:09:43,594
Live satellite
from Hong Kong.

1262
01:09:44,561 --> 01:09:46,163
My only vice.

1263
01:09:46,296 --> 01:09:48,666
Well, that's not
strictly true, is it?

1264
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:50,835
Meaning?

1265
01:09:50,968 --> 01:09:54,437
Meaning I've always taken vice
to be the definition

1266
01:09:54,572 --> 01:09:57,540
of any criminal activity
or wicked behavior

1267
01:09:57,675 --> 01:10:00,443
involving prostitution,
pornography or drugs,

1268
01:10:00,578 --> 01:10:02,847
so, no...

1269
01:10:03,914 --> 01:10:07,218
racing is definitely not
your only vice, your lordship.

1270
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:10,286
I'd say you're eyebrows deep
in every vice known to man.

1271
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:12,522
- There is a difference.
- Being?

1272
01:10:13,157 --> 01:10:19,496
I facilitate. I don't participate
in any of the aforementioned vices.

1273
01:10:22,066 --> 01:10:23,167
What about tea?

1274
01:10:33,944 --> 01:10:35,311
What about tea?

1275
01:10:35,445 --> 01:10:38,582
Well, that too is a vice.

1276
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:41,451
Caffeine is a drug,
don't you know?

1277
01:10:41,585 --> 01:10:45,421
So is that what you're here
to talk to me about? Tea?

1278
01:10:45,555 --> 01:10:49,359
Sweet Mary Jane is my vice
of choice, as you well know.

1279
01:10:49,794 --> 01:10:53,063
Of course, I'm addicted to
selling it, not consuming it.

1280
01:10:53,429 --> 01:10:56,667
I specifically chose
to deal in marijuana.

1281
01:10:57,101 --> 01:10:59,003
Sure, I could see
there was more to be made

1282
01:10:59,136 --> 01:11:02,740
in shifting the white or the brown
powder, as you so chose,

1283
01:11:02,873 --> 01:11:07,410
but, you see, my jam,
it doesn't kill anyone,

1284
01:11:07,812 --> 01:11:09,512
and I like that.

1285
01:11:11,916 --> 01:11:13,584
<i>While your poison...</i>

1286
01:11:14,752 --> 01:11:19,389
is and always has been
a destroyer of worlds.

1287
01:11:27,598 --> 01:11:32,670
So, yes, your facilitation is
most definitely participation.

1288
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:45,883
But I'm not here to give you a
sermon on situational ethics.

1289
01:11:46,482 --> 01:11:49,286
So why the fuck
are you here?

1290
01:12:06,502 --> 01:12:08,538
You're starting a war
with me, George,

1291
01:12:08,672 --> 01:12:10,373
and I'm trying to moonwalk
with elegance here,

1292
01:12:10,506 --> 01:12:12,408
but I'm finding it
very fucking difficult.

1293
01:12:12,542 --> 01:12:14,078
Laura!

1294
01:12:14,211 --> 01:12:15,880
<i>I don't fuck around with puff.</i>

1295
01:12:16,013 --> 01:12:18,048
You send your man Dry Eye
around my place

1296
01:12:18,182 --> 01:12:20,017
to see if he can buy
my business for a few beans.

1297
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:21,218
Laura!

1298
01:12:23,419 --> 01:12:25,289
<i>You didn't
think I'd find out?</i>

1299
01:12:25,421 --> 01:12:27,291
Having me followed
for months?

1300
01:12:28,558 --> 01:12:30,861
Yeah. You crossed the line,

1301
01:12:30,995 --> 01:12:32,562
<i>and that comes
with a price.</i>

1302
01:12:33,163 --> 01:12:35,099
You raided
one of my locations.

1303
01:12:35,833 --> 01:12:37,601
You know the rules,
George.

1304
01:12:38,401 --> 01:12:39,904
What the fuck
were you thinking?

1305
01:12:40,037 --> 01:12:41,872
You raided one of
my locations.

1306
01:12:42,006 --> 01:12:43,874
<i>What the fuck
were you thinking?</i>

1307
01:12:44,241 --> 01:12:46,277
What the fuck
were you thinking, George?

1308
01:13:22,545 --> 01:13:25,649
Should you
try and undermine me,

1309
01:13:26,383 --> 01:13:29,119
or should you attempt
to threaten my position again,

1310
01:13:29,253 --> 01:13:31,855
I will be forced to accept
your call to arms.

1311
01:13:31,989 --> 01:13:33,190
Do you understand?

1312
01:13:35,659 --> 01:13:36,760
Good.

1313
01:13:38,128 --> 01:13:41,799
Now, I can see you're feeling
somewhat under the weather.

1314
01:13:42,299 --> 01:13:44,001
<i>That's because
I spiked your tea</i>

1315
01:13:44,134 --> 01:13:46,937
<i>with a nasty little parasitic
genus called shigella.</i>

1316
01:13:47,771 --> 01:13:51,275
Left unattended, you will shit yourself
to death before the sun doth set.

1317
01:13:53,043 --> 01:13:55,012
I suggest taking
two of these fizzy biscuits.

1318
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,183
You'll be fine
in an hour or two,

1319
01:13:59,783 --> 01:14:02,086
long enough to consider
your past indiscretions.

1320
01:14:07,992 --> 01:14:11,695
And, George, if I can get to
you in your own kitchen...

1321
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:14,431
I can get to you anywhere.

1322
01:14:22,639 --> 01:14:25,309
- Did you do it?
- Do what?

1323
01:14:25,442 --> 01:14:27,911
Did you raid
Mickey Pearson's farm?

1324
01:14:28,045 --> 01:14:32,149
- No.
- So you're telling me that Phuc did this behind your back.

1325
01:14:33,017 --> 01:14:35,786
Well, let's just say this.
He didn't do it in front of it.

1326
01:14:36,552 --> 01:14:37,654
He did it
without my blessing.

1327
01:14:37,788 --> 01:14:39,356
But you did go behind my back

1328
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:41,258
and offer to buy his business.

1329
01:14:43,293 --> 01:14:45,929
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

1330
01:14:48,365 --> 01:14:50,601
Now, let me warn you
the way you warn me.

1331
01:14:51,534 --> 01:14:55,406
There comes a point where
the young succeed the old.

1332
01:14:56,507 --> 01:14:57,674
Don't push me.

1333
01:15:02,179 --> 01:15:03,814
There are some things
I don't know about.

1334
01:15:03,947 --> 01:15:07,051
Something between Dry Eye
and Lord George.

1335
01:15:07,184 --> 01:15:12,489
Now, whatever it was,
someone killed Lord George.

1336
01:15:12,956 --> 01:15:17,394
Anyone else might think
that was you or Mickey.

1337
01:15:19,863 --> 01:15:21,999
Shall we continue
with our little story?

1338
01:15:23,667 --> 01:15:25,736
Does that arouse
your interest, Raymond?

1339
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:27,871
So Matthew knows Dry Eye.

1340
01:15:29,206 --> 01:15:31,241
- So what?
- Well, yes, I agree.

1341
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:32,743
Perhaps they were
just meeting up

1342
01:15:32,876 --> 01:15:34,478
to talk about holidaying
in the Maldives

1343
01:15:34,611 --> 01:15:38,449
or the long-term implications
of leaving the EU.

1344
01:15:38,582 --> 01:15:43,454
But I filmed it, had it lip-read,
translated and transcribed.

1345
01:15:43,587 --> 01:15:46,557
Rather like the classic
1974 film <i>The Conversation,</i>

1346
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:49,059
starring Gene Hackman
and John Cazale.

1347
01:15:49,193 --> 01:15:52,496
You know, Coppola slipped that
one out between the <i>Godfathers.</i>

1348
01:15:53,063 --> 01:15:55,399
It wasn't really for me.
It's a bit boring, to be honest.

1349
01:15:55,532 --> 01:16:00,537
Now, can I just say, that Matthew,
he's quite something, isn't he?

1350
01:16:00,671 --> 01:16:02,639
He's not
your average American.

1351
01:16:02,773 --> 01:16:06,076
He's a Mr. International.
Even speaks a bit of Cantonese.

1352
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:11,583
Come here. You play Dry Eye
and I shall be Matthew.

1353
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:14,384
Come on.

1354
01:16:19,056 --> 01:16:21,825
All right.

1355
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:24,728
Try and get it in time
with his lips, all right?

1356
01:16:24,862 --> 01:16:26,463
- Yeah, yeah.
- Ready?

1357
01:16:27,564 --> 01:16:28,765
Roll camera. Action.

1358
01:16:42,112 --> 01:16:44,481
<i>There was an incident.
Lord George...</i>

1359
01:16:44,616 --> 01:16:45,716
<i>Fuck's sake, Raymond.</i>

1360
01:16:45,849 --> 01:16:47,384
It's a bit fucking wooden.

1361
01:16:47,518 --> 01:16:49,386
Put something into it,
you know, a bit of welly.

1362
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:51,355
And action.

1363
01:16:51,488 --> 01:16:52,856
There was an incident.

1364
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:54,658
Lord George
didn't come through it.

1365
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:56,360
Didn't come through it?

1366
01:16:56,493 --> 01:16:58,862
The last thing you need to do
is attract any octopus.

1367
01:16:58,996 --> 01:17:00,297
Octopus?

1368
01:17:01,565 --> 01:17:04,334
What does that mean?
It's not a very good translation.

1369
01:17:04,468 --> 01:17:06,036
No, there's nothing wrong
with the translation.

1370
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:07,838
Matthew's not that fluent.
And it's Cantonese.

1371
01:17:07,971 --> 01:17:09,506
Just go with it
and fill in the blanks.

1372
01:17:09,641 --> 01:17:10,974
And action.

1373
01:17:11,609 --> 01:17:13,677
<i>It's all on Michael.
He's to blame.</i>

1374
01:17:14,444 --> 01:17:15,846
<i>That is not a smart move.</i>

1375
01:17:15,979 --> 01:17:17,948
Don't tell me
what a smart move is.

1376
01:17:18,081 --> 01:17:19,216
<i>I beg for your pardon.</i>

1377
01:17:19,349 --> 01:17:21,051
You heard me
perfectly well.

1378
01:17:21,185 --> 01:17:23,720
<i>There will be repercussions
for Michael's actions.</i>

1379
01:17:23,854 --> 01:17:25,489
You think you're
running things, do you?

1380
01:17:25,989 --> 01:17:27,891
<i>Don't stroke my mouse hair.</i>

1381
01:17:29,159 --> 01:17:32,262
- What does "mouse hair" mean?
- Yeah, I think what he means is don't jeopardize my deal,

1382
01:17:32,396 --> 01:17:34,231
but I admit that one's
a bit of a googly.

1383
01:17:34,364 --> 01:17:36,033
Then Matthew loses it a bit

1384
01:17:36,166 --> 01:17:38,502
and his translation goes
completely out of the window.

1385
01:17:38,636 --> 01:17:41,438
Something about springtime
and sweaters.

1386
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:43,073
I think what he means
is he's upset.

1387
01:17:43,207 --> 01:17:44,576
<i>And then Dry Eye
says something,</i>

1388
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:46,210
<i>but some cunt
moved in front of me,</i>

1389
01:17:46,343 --> 01:17:47,679
<i>so I didn't get that
either.</i>

1390
01:17:47,811 --> 01:17:49,880
Your Cantonese
is dog shit,

1391
01:17:50,013 --> 01:17:51,081
so I'm gonna say this
in English

1392
01:17:51,215 --> 01:17:52,249
and I'm gonna say it once,

1393
01:17:52,382 --> 01:17:54,084
so listen to me,
Rubenstein.

1394
01:17:56,654 --> 01:17:58,388
This is how
it's gonna play out.

1395
01:17:59,756 --> 01:18:01,425
You're gonna
back the fuck off...

1396
01:18:02,392 --> 01:18:04,094
and I'm gonna
take it all.

1397
01:18:05,395 --> 01:18:08,131
And you will pay me
my respect.

1398
01:18:09,233 --> 01:18:11,468
And there you have it.
That's all I've got.

1399
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:14,438
Sorry. Show's over.

1400
01:18:14,572 --> 01:18:17,241
But I think
it's quite clear

1401
01:18:17,374 --> 01:18:19,810
that they're not just
mah-jongg partners, are they?

1402
01:18:20,377 --> 01:18:21,445
Mm?

1403
01:18:29,019 --> 01:18:31,455
Not all of that
was clear, Fletcher.

1404
01:18:31,589 --> 01:18:33,223
I mean,
according to you,

1405
01:18:33,357 --> 01:18:35,693
we already know Matthew
wants to buy Michael out.

1406
01:18:36,728 --> 01:18:40,197
- So why is that news?
- Oh, don't you worry, my darling.

1407
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:42,132
We are gonna
come to the news.

1408
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:45,535
<i>I'm approaching my climax.</i>

1409
01:18:52,242 --> 01:18:53,543
Dry Eye.

1410
01:18:54,077 --> 01:18:57,381
I trust you will make
Michael Pearson pay for this.

1411
01:18:58,248 --> 01:19:00,217
You are
the dragon head now.

1412
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:02,119
Solidify your position.

1413
01:19:03,588 --> 01:19:04,921
It will be done, Uncle.

1414
01:19:06,023 --> 01:19:08,892
<i>So Dry Eye got the upgrade
he was after, didn't he, Raymond?</i>

1415
01:19:09,026 --> 01:19:11,461
<i>The question is,
what was he gonna do with it</i>

1416
01:19:11,596 --> 01:19:13,598
<i>now that he's
Billy Big Bollocks?</i>

1417
01:19:13,731 --> 01:19:15,332
Give me ten minutes,
Ray.

1418
01:19:16,466 --> 01:19:17,501
Boss.

1419
01:19:31,415 --> 01:19:32,750
Hello, Ros.

1420
01:19:32,883 --> 01:19:34,885
It's date night tonight,

1421
01:19:35,018 --> 01:19:37,789
9:00 p.m., you and I,
River Cafe.

1422
01:19:37,921 --> 01:19:40,190
Nine o'clock? I'll be there.

1423
01:19:43,994 --> 01:19:45,562
We're closed.

1424
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:46,830
Hang up.

1425
01:19:48,666 --> 01:19:49,701
No.

1426
01:19:50,267 --> 01:19:51,368
<i>Hang the fucking phone up.</i>

1427
01:19:51,501 --> 01:19:52,536
Who's there?

1428
01:19:54,504 --> 01:19:56,039
Ros, who's there?

1429
01:19:56,373 --> 01:19:57,541
<i>What you doing here,
Dry Eye?</i>

1430
01:20:01,545 --> 01:20:03,380
It's warming up now,
isn't it?

1431
01:20:03,513 --> 01:20:07,217
At this point, I'm guessing
that you didn't even know

1432
01:20:07,351 --> 01:20:09,386
that Lord George
was dead yet,

1433
01:20:09,519 --> 01:20:11,888
let alone
what Dry Eye was up to.

1434
01:20:12,022 --> 01:20:14,491
Hello, Dry Eye.
What do you want?

1435
01:20:26,903 --> 01:20:28,004
Fancy a boiled sweet?

1436
01:20:28,673 --> 01:20:31,208
- No.
- Suit yourself.

1437
01:20:39,516 --> 01:20:40,852
Who the fuck was he?

1438
01:20:41,351 --> 01:20:43,153
<i>I'm not exactly
sure what happened next,</i>

1439
01:20:43,286 --> 01:20:45,723
<i>because you two managed
to give me the slip.</i>

1440
01:20:45,857 --> 01:20:47,891
They got Rosalind.
Call Roger.

1441
01:20:49,559 --> 01:20:51,763
Oh, goody. Another bottle.

1442
01:20:51,895 --> 01:20:54,030
Hold on. You were there?

1443
01:20:56,734 --> 01:20:58,770
Yeah.
Of course I was there.

1444
01:20:59,503 --> 01:21:02,874
He's not picking up. Maybe you
should put your seat belt on.

1445
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:06,042
Yeah, let me call Rosalind.
Let me do it.

1446
01:21:07,544 --> 01:21:09,714
I got it.
Just watch the road.

1447
01:21:10,547 --> 01:21:12,382
Now, Rosalind, don't be alarmed,

1448
01:21:12,516 --> 01:21:14,217
but you're gonna
come with me

1449
01:21:14,351 --> 01:21:16,587
until I can resolve all these
issues with your husband.

1450
01:21:17,354 --> 01:21:18,756
I'm not going anywhere.

1451
01:21:19,556 --> 01:21:21,425
She's not picking up.
It's just ringing.

1452
01:21:21,558 --> 01:21:24,361
- Fuck.
- We could just slow down a little bit.

1453
01:21:26,196 --> 01:21:27,564
Fuck!

1454
01:21:42,279 --> 01:21:43,915
<i>You know how it works.</i>

1455
01:21:44,615 --> 01:21:48,118
You either come with me or Tony
here is gonna make you come with me.

1456
01:21:48,251 --> 01:21:50,954
You're in my office
under my roof.

1457
01:21:51,087 --> 01:21:52,857
It's not your position
for Tony to do anything

1458
01:21:52,989 --> 01:21:55,325
other than to fuck off back
from whence he came.

1459
01:21:55,459 --> 01:21:57,093
Tony.

1460
01:21:59,262 --> 01:22:01,666
What's that?
Is that a paperweight?

1461
01:22:01,799 --> 01:22:05,302
Funny you should say that. Turns out
anything with weight can be a paperweight.

1462
01:22:05,435 --> 01:22:07,605
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Well, that's up to you, isn't it?

1463
01:22:07,738 --> 01:22:10,106
Either you do as I tell
you to and use the door,

1464
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:12,643
or I'm gonna shoot fat Tony
right between the eyes.

1465
01:22:12,777 --> 01:22:14,779
You see, this gun's
only got two bullets,

1466
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:17,347
so I'm not gonna fuck about
illustrating its significance.

1467
01:22:17,481 --> 01:22:19,216
You're gonna have to
trust me on that.

1468
01:22:19,349 --> 01:22:21,151
The alternative
is a little bit absolute.

1469
01:22:22,419 --> 01:22:24,321
I'm gonna have
to check your grammar on that.

1470
01:22:24,789 --> 01:22:26,958
It can't be
just a little bit absolute.

1471
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:29,559
It either is or it isn't.

1472
01:22:29,694 --> 01:22:32,797
Whatever it is,
I've lost my patience.

1473
01:22:32,930 --> 01:22:36,801
I'm telling you, I will squeeze this
trigger and Tony will be no more.

1474
01:22:36,934 --> 01:22:38,803
Tony.

1475
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:42,707
Listen to me, cunt.
You take one step forward,

1476
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,675
it'll be the last fucking
step you ever take.

1477
01:22:44,809 --> 01:22:46,176
Tony, get on it.

1478
01:23:21,511 --> 01:23:22,914
I fucking dare you.

1479
01:23:25,616 --> 01:23:26,717
Just calm down.

1480
01:23:27,818 --> 01:23:28,853
I'm leaving.

1481
01:23:36,526 --> 01:23:37,995
I guess that's
your two bullets, eh?

1482
01:23:38,963 --> 01:23:40,263
Rosalind!

1483
01:23:54,210 --> 01:23:55,580
Rosalind!

1484
01:24:02,085 --> 01:24:03,788
Stay fucking still!

1485
01:24:11,062 --> 01:24:11,996
Hello, babe.

1486
01:24:28,879 --> 01:24:29,947
Hello, love.

1487
01:24:30,615 --> 01:24:32,850
<i>So you're
basing your whole crescendo</i>

1488
01:24:33,383 --> 01:24:35,019
on a figment
of your imagination.

1489
01:24:35,151 --> 01:24:38,923
I'm basing my whole crescendo
on the sum of its parts.

1490
01:24:39,056 --> 01:24:41,291
A few minor details aside,
I wouldn't have any trouble at all

1491
01:24:41,424 --> 01:24:45,395
selling this juicy peach
of a drama to Big Dave.

1492
01:24:45,528 --> 01:24:47,430
He'd cream
his fucking panties.

1493
01:24:47,564 --> 01:24:50,233
You're too smart to be
blackmailing us, Fletcher.

1494
01:24:50,367 --> 01:24:53,070
Yes, yes, and obviously I've
taken precautionary measures.

1495
01:24:53,370 --> 01:24:56,774
You can do all kinds of
horrible things to me if you want.

1496
01:24:57,273 --> 01:24:59,076
I might even enjoy them.

1497
01:24:59,209 --> 01:25:01,812
But you'd have to leave the
country and never come back.

1498
01:25:01,946 --> 01:25:03,914
So is that the story over
now, Fletcher?

1499
01:25:04,048 --> 01:25:07,752
All this, this whole buildup,
was leading to this next part.

1500
01:25:07,885 --> 01:25:11,122
This is the news that
you were asking about before.

1501
01:25:11,254 --> 01:25:12,690
Ready?

1502
01:25:13,289 --> 01:25:14,324
Matthew.

1503
01:25:15,158 --> 01:25:16,961
<i>He's gonna need some people
to run his business here</i>

1504
01:25:17,094 --> 01:25:18,996
<i>when he buys it
from Michael, right?</i>

1505
01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:21,932
He's gonna need a reliable pair of
hands, someone like you.

1506
01:25:22,066 --> 01:25:24,035
Hmm. So why didn't he
ask you, Raymond?

1507
01:25:24,167 --> 01:25:26,536
I don't know.
It's none of my business.

1508
01:25:26,671 --> 01:25:28,204
Because, I'll tell you,

1509
01:25:28,839 --> 01:25:31,341
he already had someone
earmarked for the role.

1510
01:25:32,143 --> 01:25:35,278
<i>Dry Eye.
He promised Dry Eye the job,</i>

1511
01:25:35,412 --> 01:25:39,182
but only if Dry Eye helped drive
down the price of Mickey's business.

1512
01:25:39,315 --> 01:25:43,688
You see, it was Matthew who told Dry
Eye the location of Mickey's farm,

1513
01:25:43,821 --> 01:25:46,189
<i>so he could steal
his white widow super cheese</i>

1514
01:25:46,322 --> 01:25:48,592
to cause ripples
and reduce the market value.

1515
01:25:48,726 --> 01:25:51,394
And that is why Phuc,
in turn,

1516
01:25:51,528 --> 01:25:55,766
<i>got those juice-swilling,
acne-backed muscle Marys to do the job.</i>

1517
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:57,768
<i>It was Matthew</i>

1518
01:25:57,902 --> 01:26:00,671
who set this whole
train of events off.

1519
01:26:01,471 --> 01:26:03,741
<i>But what he did not
plan on, you see...</i>

1520
01:26:03,874 --> 01:26:05,576
Fuck you,
you old cunt!

1521
01:26:05,710 --> 01:26:07,011
I'll piss on your grave.

1522
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:11,281
<i>...was Dry Eye...</i>

1523
01:26:13,184 --> 01:26:14,417
killing Lord George.

1524
01:26:15,886 --> 01:26:19,522
<i>Now, Dry Eye does not want to be
subservient to Matthew anymore.</i>

1525
01:26:19,657 --> 01:26:21,058
Doesn't wanna be
subservient to anyone.

1526
01:26:21,192 --> 01:26:22,960
This is how
it's gonna play out.

1527
01:26:24,494 --> 01:26:26,296
You're gonna
back the fuck off

1528
01:26:26,831 --> 01:26:28,799
and I'm gonna
take it all.

1529
01:26:28,933 --> 01:26:32,636
Dry Eye likes the smell of
power and does not like Matthew.

1530
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:37,141
<i>So, the little dragon needed a gentle
reminder of who was really running things.</i>

1531
01:26:37,273 --> 01:26:39,309
You've been in this paddling
pool for two minutes.

1532
01:26:39,442 --> 01:26:42,278
I've been swimming in the ocean
with the sharks for 20 years.

1533
01:26:42,412 --> 01:26:44,982
I'll tell you
how this plays out.

1534
01:26:45,716 --> 01:26:47,218
You will drown...

1535
01:26:48,351 --> 01:26:51,088
and then my Mossad crabs
will eat you.

1536
01:26:51,222 --> 01:26:56,093
And this, my love, is why I want
my hard-earned 20 million pounds.

1537
01:26:56,227 --> 01:27:02,265
Because not only do I know exactly
how Mickey's business operates,

1538
01:27:02,398 --> 01:27:06,704
but I also know that the very
man he's trying to sell it to

1539
01:27:06,837 --> 01:27:09,472
is trying to force him
into selling it on the cheap

1540
01:27:09,607 --> 01:27:12,542
and has indirectly
started a war.

1541
01:27:13,244 --> 01:27:16,580
So, you see, I think you should be
calling me your trusted consigliere,

1542
01:27:17,547 --> 01:27:19,083
or your spy
behind the lines,

1543
01:27:19,216 --> 01:27:23,220
your intellectual
reconnaissance, if you prefer.

1544
01:27:24,722 --> 01:27:26,123
I'm impressed.

1545
01:27:27,357 --> 01:27:29,559
You certainly know
more than I do.

1546
01:27:29,693 --> 01:27:32,428
I'm impressed not only
by your information,

1547
01:27:32,562 --> 01:27:34,665
but by your imagination.

1548
01:27:35,431 --> 01:27:36,667
Thank you very much.

1549
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:41,071
So you've got 72 hours.

1550
01:27:42,106 --> 01:27:45,308
And I would just reiterate
that if anything happens to me,

1551
01:27:45,441 --> 01:27:47,778
I do have my insurance policy
in place.

1552
01:27:48,245 --> 01:27:51,015
Everything will go to Big Dave,
and from him to the public,

1553
01:27:51,148 --> 01:27:53,117
and you, my love,
will go to Mars.

1554
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:56,319
So, strong recommendation,
just pay up

1555
01:27:56,452 --> 01:28:01,992
and watch me recede into the
sunset blowing kisses, yes?

1556
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:09,200
Well, then, time to use the
door, you black bastard.

1557
01:28:09,332 --> 01:28:11,669
Well, that's just silly, isn't
it, 'cause I'm not black.

1558
01:28:11,802 --> 01:28:14,672
No, but your fucking soul is,
you dark cunt.

1559
01:28:16,874 --> 01:28:19,977
Now, out of my house,
'cause I'm going to bed.

1560
01:28:22,478 --> 01:28:23,981
Can I come with you?

1561
01:28:25,348 --> 01:28:29,385
No, but you can go smoke the exhaust
pipe in the back of your hearse.

1562
01:28:31,055 --> 01:28:32,488
I might come anyway.

1563
01:28:34,058 --> 01:28:36,694
You'll just hear me
scratching about in the dark,

1564
01:28:37,393 --> 01:28:39,163
wanking into a hanky.

1565
01:28:44,367 --> 01:28:46,904
All right, so, 20 million.

1566
01:28:48,038 --> 01:28:49,940
You've got 72 hours,
starting now.

1567
01:28:50,875 --> 01:28:53,543
Ticktock, ticktock.

1568
01:28:55,079 --> 01:28:56,313
And I'm gone.

1569
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:00,885
Ticktock.

1570
01:29:04,889 --> 01:29:06,590
Ticktock.

1571
01:29:16,333 --> 01:29:18,002
He's just left.

1572
01:29:18,135 --> 01:29:19,737
He thinks he's very clever.

1573
01:29:20,503 --> 01:29:21,939
Start with Big Dave.

1574
01:29:27,144 --> 01:29:29,246
Now, you keep this
between you and me, Hammy,

1575
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:31,949
but Fletcher's been in touch.
He says he's got what we need.

1576
01:29:32,082 --> 01:29:34,550
Careful, boss. Fletcher's ass
belongs to the highest bidder.

1577
01:29:34,685 --> 01:29:36,552
Yeah.
He says he wants 150 grand.

1578
01:29:36,687 --> 01:29:39,056
But if it's proper, it's worth
a whole week's exclusive.

1579
01:29:39,189 --> 01:29:40,456
Well, what does he
have exactly?

1580
01:29:40,591 --> 01:29:42,026
He was just
tickling me nuts,

1581
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:43,459
but he says
he wants to meet Saturday.

1582
01:29:43,594 --> 01:29:44,695
So keep it free.

1583
01:29:47,097 --> 01:29:48,464
Yeah, pronto.

1584
01:29:55,505 --> 01:29:58,142
Oi, you can't park there,
mate. Move the van.

1585
01:29:58,275 --> 01:30:00,411
Don't worry, friend.
We'll be gone in a minute.

1586
01:30:00,543 --> 01:30:02,746
We're not a newspaper.
We're a blood sport.

1587
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,514
Oi, Russ. Move the van.

1588
01:30:04,648 --> 01:30:06,183
I'm on it, boss.

1589
01:30:06,984 --> 01:30:08,619
Move it. Now.

1590
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:12,522
- I said in a minute.
- Oi, spunk bubble.

1591
01:30:12,656 --> 01:30:14,591
Get rid of
the fucking van.

1592
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:23,167
I'm warning you,
Russ does karate.

1593
01:30:27,771 --> 01:30:31,041
Careful, boys.
Russ does karate.

1594
01:30:32,475 --> 01:30:34,878
Russ, if you know
what's good for you,

1595
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:36,981
get in the car now.

1596
01:30:40,451 --> 01:30:43,519
Sorry, boss.
I'm only a blue belt.

1597
01:30:45,022 --> 01:30:46,457
You melt.

1598
01:30:47,992 --> 01:30:51,328
Now what? We're making
a YouTube movie? Eh?

1599
01:30:52,029 --> 01:30:53,297
Break dancing?

1600
01:30:54,131 --> 01:30:57,368
I'm warning you.
I'm fucking powerful.

1601
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:00,637
We know all that. Why don't you tell
us all about it in the back of the van?

1602
01:31:00,771 --> 01:31:03,807
I'm not going.
I'm not fucking... No!

1603
01:31:03,941 --> 01:31:05,809
No.

1604
01:31:05,943 --> 01:31:07,611
Get him in there.

1605
01:31:10,414 --> 01:31:11,682
Unbelievable.

1606
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:18,055
Well, well, well.

1607
01:31:21,625 --> 01:31:23,694
You're all right, Big Dave.
You're in safe hands now.

1608
01:31:23,827 --> 01:31:26,562
- No need to panic, okay?
- Who are you?

1609
01:31:26,697 --> 01:31:28,531
Don't worry about that
right now.

1610
01:31:29,700 --> 01:31:31,201
Look...

1611
01:31:31,335 --> 01:31:32,970
Look, whatever's
gone on here,

1612
01:31:33,103 --> 01:31:34,671
I just need
to get back to work.

1613
01:31:34,805 --> 01:31:36,707
If you let me go,
I'll just forget all about it.

1614
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:39,810
I'll have you back to work
in short order, my friend.

1615
01:31:39,943 --> 01:31:41,245
Now, I believe
you're a reporter.

1616
01:31:42,679 --> 01:31:44,547
And there's something
I wanna report to you.

1617
01:31:44,681 --> 01:31:46,717
Now, it seems for
this brief moment in time

1618
01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:49,053
I've found my way
into the film business,

1619
01:31:49,186 --> 01:31:53,891
and last night I made a film with
an impressively sized farmyard pig.

1620
01:31:57,895 --> 01:32:00,364
Morning, sir.
Two cups of tea.

1621
01:32:00,497 --> 01:32:03,033
One with sugar, one without.

1622
01:32:03,167 --> 01:32:05,135
All right, lads,
go on, give us a minute.

1623
01:32:08,005 --> 01:32:09,940
There are some wet
wipes there over your shoulder.

1624
01:32:10,074 --> 01:32:12,476
Your clothes are neatly folded
there on the bench.

1625
01:32:12,609 --> 01:32:16,246
Now, in due course, you're gonna
press the space bar on this computer

1626
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:19,883
and you're gonna witness your
participation in said film.

1627
01:32:20,017 --> 01:32:23,420
Now, that little drug we
gave you last night really...

1628
01:32:25,089 --> 01:32:26,824
loosened up
your inhibitions, man.

1629
01:32:27,558 --> 01:32:31,061
The only thing you'll need to do to
stop this little creative expression

1630
01:32:31,195 --> 01:32:33,664
from becoming
a social media sensation

1631
01:32:33,797 --> 01:32:36,633
is lose any interest you have
in the future of Mickey Pearson.

1632
01:32:38,035 --> 01:32:39,937
I'm gonna leave you now
to clean yourself up.

1633
01:32:41,872 --> 01:32:43,474
Space bar, yeah?
Have a hot drink as well.

1634
01:32:43,607 --> 01:32:45,642
It might make you feel
a little bit better.

1635
01:32:45,776 --> 01:32:47,511
It was a fucking rough night
for you.

1636
01:32:49,313 --> 01:32:50,914
Enjoy the show.

1637
01:32:57,387 --> 01:33:01,525
<i>♪ Old
MacDonald Had a farm, e-i-e-i-o ♪</i>

1638
01:33:01,658 --> 01:33:04,328
<i>♪ And on that farm He had a pig... ♪</i>

1639
01:33:04,461 --> 01:33:06,697
- How's your man, then, Coach?
- Ah, he'll survive.

1640
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:08,832
Wouldn't have been the pig I would have chosen, though.

1641
01:33:13,403 --> 01:33:14,905
We know what bit that is.

1642
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:18,675
<i>Let me tickle that belly.</i>

1643
01:33:18,809 --> 01:33:21,579
<i>You are so naughty.</i>

1644
01:33:21,712 --> 01:33:24,081
- Good Lord.
- I was there and I'm still shocked.

1645
01:33:24,648 --> 01:33:26,350
<i>Squeal for me, piggy.</i>

1646
01:33:26,483 --> 01:33:29,153
- Is that who I think it is?
- Yeah, it certainly is.

1647
01:33:31,755 --> 01:33:33,023
And that's your doing?

1648
01:33:33,157 --> 01:33:34,958
<i>Where is that applesauce?</i>

1649
01:33:35,559 --> 01:33:37,427
You can't unsee it
once you've seen it, can you?

1650
01:33:37,561 --> 01:33:39,530
No, you can't unsee it.
It's nightmare fuel.

1651
01:33:39,663 --> 01:33:40,831
That will be with me forever.

1652
01:33:42,232 --> 01:33:43,667
That story
won't be running.

1653
01:33:46,103 --> 01:33:48,872
Right. I've got one more
thing I need you to do.

1654
01:33:49,006 --> 01:33:51,708
Ah, look,
before you continue, Ray,

1655
01:33:51,842 --> 01:33:55,946
I train lads to be good lads.
I'm not a fucking gangster.

1656
01:33:56,079 --> 01:33:59,449
Now, I've been forced to do some
gangster things, that's okay.

1657
01:33:59,584 --> 01:34:01,619
But I'm not the gift
that keeps on giving.

1658
01:34:01,752 --> 01:34:04,354
So with the greatest respect,
I'll do this one last thing for you

1659
01:34:04,488 --> 01:34:05,956
and then that's it.

1660
01:34:06,089 --> 01:34:09,493
<i>No más.</i>
Three strikes and I'm out.

1661
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:18,368
- Everything all right, Coach?
- No, Ernie, it isn't.

1662
01:34:18,502 --> 01:34:21,071
You need to understand the
severity of your actions.

1663
01:34:28,178 --> 01:34:29,780
Dave, an hour.

1664
01:34:29,913 --> 01:34:30,948
Okay, boss.

1665
01:34:35,986 --> 01:34:38,088
Thank you
for the grand tour.

1666
01:34:38,222 --> 01:34:39,756
I'm a believer.

1667
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:41,225
Thank you, chaps.

1668
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,963
Now, are we ready
to finalize the numbers?

1669
01:34:46,763 --> 01:34:47,864
We already have.

1670
01:34:47,998 --> 01:34:49,433
Mm...

1671
01:34:49,566 --> 01:34:51,703
The situation's changed,
Michael.

1672
01:34:51,835 --> 01:34:54,404
- The market's changed.
- How so?

1673
01:34:54,938 --> 01:34:58,542
The exit value of your business
needs to be recalculated.

1674
01:34:59,276 --> 01:35:01,211
Please, be specific.

1675
01:35:01,345 --> 01:35:03,247
Oh, I will be.

1676
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:06,718
You're asking 400 for 12 locations
and a distribution network,

1677
01:35:06,850 --> 01:35:09,319
which was a fair valuation
at the time.

1678
01:35:09,453 --> 01:35:12,256
But when one of those
locations was compromised,

1679
01:35:12,389 --> 01:35:14,726
the value of all those
locations were compromised

1680
01:35:14,858 --> 01:35:16,560
and this obviously
affects the price.

1681
01:35:17,394 --> 01:35:21,031
Your skunk farm was a fucking viral
sensation on YouTube, Michael.

1682
01:35:21,164 --> 01:35:23,635
And when Johnny Law starts
sniffing, which he will,

1683
01:35:23,767 --> 01:35:25,869
all of those locations
will have to cease production

1684
01:35:26,003 --> 01:35:29,773
for, I'd say, at least 12 months
at a cost of 100 million net p.a.,

1685
01:35:29,906 --> 01:35:32,610
before marking down the loss of
staff, relocation and site rentals.

1686
01:35:32,744 --> 01:35:34,544
- You still with me?
- Yes, I'm following.

1687
01:35:34,679 --> 01:35:36,813
It will take
at least three years

1688
01:35:36,947 --> 01:35:40,417
to get your supply, distribution
and demand back to full capacity.

1689
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:44,288
Your staffing costs are 25% of
your 100 million operational cost,

1690
01:35:44,421 --> 01:35:47,991
so that's 25 million per annum
for three annums.

1691
01:35:48,125 --> 01:35:50,460
And location rental
at 15 million a year,

1692
01:35:50,595 --> 01:35:54,632
that's a 120 GBP bite
right there.

1693
01:35:54,766 --> 01:35:57,334
Your unit economics
have taken a hit,

1694
01:35:57,467 --> 01:36:02,005
and forecasting out your top-line growth
margin in the current inimical climate,

1695
01:36:02,139 --> 01:36:05,409
I calculate what was worth
400 million a month ago

1696
01:36:05,542 --> 01:36:10,013
must now be valued
at an anemic, mm... 130.

1697
01:36:11,248 --> 01:36:14,985
You see, it's not about the
first domino that fell, Michael.

1698
01:36:15,819 --> 01:36:16,987
It's about the last.

1699
01:36:19,323 --> 01:36:20,390
Please.

1700
01:36:23,927 --> 01:36:26,664
I like you, Michael.
You're a good chap.

1701
01:36:27,464 --> 01:36:31,168
And if you want me to help you out of
this hole you've found yourself in,

1702
01:36:31,803 --> 01:36:34,838
I can pay you
100 million dollars today.

1703
01:36:35,839 --> 01:36:38,308
It's a good offer
and it's real,

1704
01:36:38,442 --> 01:36:40,578
and I'll do this
because I'm your friend.

1705
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:43,815
My accountant can transfer
the fee within the hour.

1706
01:36:44,716 --> 01:36:46,751
I like your domino analogy.

1707
01:36:48,485 --> 01:36:52,522
The question I ask is,
who tumbled the first domino?

1708
01:36:53,156 --> 01:36:56,259
I'm afraid that's not my
concern or my business, Michael.

1709
01:36:56,393 --> 01:36:58,228
At the risk
of contradicting you,

1710
01:36:58,362 --> 01:37:02,332
it is very much your business,
and certainly your concern.

1711
01:37:03,801 --> 01:37:05,268
Only you made one mistake.

1712
01:37:06,637 --> 01:37:07,772
That being?

1713
01:37:08,372 --> 01:37:11,341
You seem to have mistaken me
for some kind of a cunt.

1714
01:37:13,176 --> 01:37:15,580
Let me introduce you
to the first domino.

1715
01:37:19,650 --> 01:37:24,321
It's a tad dramatic, isn't it,
corpses in freezers? Who is this man?

1716
01:37:24,454 --> 01:37:26,490
What's he got to do with
anything that I'm talking about?

1717
01:37:26,624 --> 01:37:29,226
I take it with that statement
you are in denial

1718
01:37:29,359 --> 01:37:31,928
of so-said relationship
with this frozen Chinaman?

1719
01:37:32,062 --> 01:37:34,231
Well, of course
I'm in denial of it.

1720
01:37:34,364 --> 01:37:38,034
I don't have relationships
with dead, frozen Chinamen.

1721
01:37:38,168 --> 01:37:41,739
Best not to be glib at this time
in the proceedings, Matthew.

1722
01:37:45,475 --> 01:37:47,712
Don't bother looking
for your Mossad crabs.

1723
01:37:47,845 --> 01:37:50,280
This is a fish market.
They have found a home.

1724
01:37:50,815 --> 01:37:53,350
To be clear,
I do not know that man.

1725
01:37:55,653 --> 01:37:57,454
<i>I'll tell you
how this plays out.</i>

1726
01:37:58,054 --> 01:38:02,627
<i>You will drown and then
my Mossad crabs will eat you.</i>

1727
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:06,062
So while you were discussing
who would take over my business

1728
01:38:06,196 --> 01:38:07,698
after you fucked it,

1729
01:38:08,666 --> 01:38:11,736
you somehow mistook so-said
Chinaman for someone else?

1730
01:38:13,403 --> 01:38:17,441
Business is business, Michael.
It's nothing personal.

1731
01:38:17,575 --> 01:38:19,911
While I am not emotional
about the money,

1732
01:38:20,043 --> 01:38:23,815
there is a price indebted to me for
the blood I've gotten on my hands

1733
01:38:23,947 --> 01:38:27,350
restoring order to the
untidiness that you created,

1734
01:38:27,484 --> 01:38:29,119
and that price,
according to you...

1735
01:38:29,252 --> 01:38:33,290
400 minus 130...
is 270 million dollars.

1736
01:38:33,423 --> 01:38:36,493
And I'm keeping
the business,

1737
01:38:37,795 --> 01:38:40,932
while you are
getting in the freezer.

1738
01:38:41,599 --> 01:38:44,702
And you will make that transaction if
you want to get out of the freezer.

1739
01:38:44,836 --> 01:38:49,306
It is 25 below zero in there,
so I assume you'll last about an hour.

1740
01:38:49,439 --> 01:38:51,208
That said,
I wouldn't fuck about,

1741
01:38:51,341 --> 01:38:53,510
because frostbite is very
expensive on the fingers and toes,

1742
01:38:53,644 --> 01:38:57,481
so I would type as quickly as possible
while you have the use of them.

1743
01:38:58,181 --> 01:39:00,283
- Uh...
- After you've attended to that indiscretion,

1744
01:39:00,417 --> 01:39:04,287
you can then deal with the next
consequence of your shortsightedness.

1745
01:39:04,856 --> 01:39:08,826
As stated,
I am not emotional about the money.

1746
01:39:11,528 --> 01:39:15,198
But I am emotional about the fact that
someone laid their hands on my wife.

1747
01:39:18,535 --> 01:39:19,804
My wife!

1748
01:39:22,405 --> 01:39:25,843
No amount of money on God's green earth
can pay for that transgression, Matthew.

1749
01:39:25,977 --> 01:39:27,544
No, for that...

1750
01:39:31,414 --> 01:39:32,650
I want a pound of flesh.

1751
01:39:33,818 --> 01:39:34,886
A pound of flesh?

1752
01:39:35,018 --> 01:39:36,553
It matters not to me

1753
01:39:36,687 --> 01:39:38,689
where on your anatomy
it is withdrawn from.

1754
01:39:39,624 --> 01:39:42,827
If you don't have the stomach
to take it for yourself,

1755
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:45,061
big Bunny here
is very adept with a knife,

1756
01:39:45,195 --> 01:39:47,030
and, as you can see,
he's dressed for the weather.

1757
01:39:47,163 --> 01:39:51,468
But a penny short
or a gram shy...

1758
01:39:52,870 --> 01:39:55,305
and that freezer door
does not open.

1759
01:39:55,438 --> 01:39:56,473
Am I clear?

1760
01:39:57,608 --> 01:39:58,643
Good.

1761
01:39:59,710 --> 01:40:01,378
- Bunny.
- Incoming.

1762
01:40:14,157 --> 01:40:16,560
What, is it Wagyu again
for breakfast, Raymond?

1763
01:40:18,896 --> 01:40:22,566
Aren't you gonna introduce me to your
mysterious and slightly menacing friend?

1764
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:30,041
What's that for?
Is that for my money?

1765
01:40:32,509 --> 01:40:33,644
Where's my money, Raymond?

1766
01:40:33,778 --> 01:40:35,245
There's your payment.

1767
01:40:39,050 --> 01:40:40,550
Go on, take a look.

1768
01:40:40,685 --> 01:40:42,552
Thank you,
mysterious stranger.

1769
01:40:52,697 --> 01:40:55,231
Well, that's disappointing, 'cause that
doesn't look like 20 million pounds.

1770
01:40:55,365 --> 01:40:58,401
It's more interesting than that,
your insurance policy,

1771
01:40:58,535 --> 01:41:01,939
all the photos, all the bodies,
all the skeletons, all the filth.

1772
01:41:02,073 --> 01:41:06,309
It's not the only one,
darling. I'm not a mong.

1773
01:41:06,443 --> 01:41:08,746
What do you think's in that,
you fucking eejit?

1774
01:41:09,614 --> 01:41:11,749
Of course we were
aware of what Matthew was up to.

1775
01:41:11,882 --> 01:41:13,618
We're not complete
fucking idiots.

1776
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:18,589
I've been onto you
for a long time, Fletcher.

1777
01:41:19,556 --> 01:41:21,626
I knew you'd been following Michael.

1778
01:41:21,759 --> 01:41:23,393
<i>They're very similar,
our jobs.</i>

1779
01:41:23,961 --> 01:41:26,196
<i>Only I'm better at it
than you are.</i>

1780
01:41:27,898 --> 01:41:31,468
I knew when you came over that night that
you'd only be there for half an hour...

1781
01:41:32,335 --> 01:41:34,270
<i>Buenas tardes, Raymondo.</i>

1782
01:41:34,404 --> 01:41:37,474
...to tell me how clever you
are and try to blackmail us.

1783
01:41:38,208 --> 01:41:40,477
I've got some very important
information to impart to you, Raymond.

1784
01:41:40,611 --> 01:41:44,115
I also knew you couldn't
resist a £1500 single malt,

1785
01:41:44,247 --> 01:41:47,652
an £80 Wagyu steak and a
state-of-the-art smokeless barbie

1786
01:41:48,218 --> 01:41:50,855
- that even keeps your feet warm.
- I love a barbie.

1787
01:41:50,988 --> 01:41:53,858
I promise you, you will regret
this if you don't hear it.

1788
01:41:53,991 --> 01:41:56,627
And when the Scotch
got into your cold veins,

1789
01:41:56,761 --> 01:41:59,462
you lost the benefit
of your sharp instincts.

1790
01:41:59,930 --> 01:42:02,165
Oh, goody. Another bottle.

1791
01:42:02,298 --> 01:42:04,835
Can you tell the mysterious
gentleman to relax?

1792
01:42:04,969 --> 01:42:08,005
Because I promise you, you will regret it
if you don't hear this. Sit down, my love.

1793
01:42:08,139 --> 01:42:11,541
See, I kept you there 'cause I needed
to know about Matthew and Dry Eye.

1794
01:42:12,743 --> 01:42:15,780
<i>Took us a while to find
your insurance policies.</i>

1795
01:42:17,447 --> 01:42:19,482
<i>'Cause you're
a naughty squirrel, Fletcher.</i>

1796
01:42:20,417 --> 01:42:22,552
Fletcher, shoes off inside.

1797
01:42:22,687 --> 01:42:23,988
Yes, Mommy.

1798
01:42:25,022 --> 01:42:28,358
<i>But it was made a lot easier after
I planted a tracker in your shoe.</i>

1799
01:42:32,830 --> 01:42:35,032
<i>You're never gonna be
a predator with us, Fletcher.</i>

1800
01:42:36,901 --> 01:42:38,736
You're always
gonna be prey.

1801
01:42:39,970 --> 01:42:43,339
So that's it. Three strikes.
We're good, right?

1802
01:42:46,043 --> 01:42:49,180
- I'll see you around.
- With the greatest respect, I hope not.

1803
01:42:55,518 --> 01:42:59,924
Now, Fletcher,
what were you saying?

1804
01:43:00,658 --> 01:43:03,226
It wasn't
Lord George that was after Mickey,

1805
01:43:03,359 --> 01:43:05,796
or Dry Eye, or Matthew.

1806
01:43:06,931 --> 01:43:08,264
Do you wanna know who it was?

1807
01:43:12,903 --> 01:43:14,105
I've got photos.

1808
01:43:16,841 --> 01:43:18,709
Right.
You've got 30 seconds.

1809
01:43:18,843 --> 01:43:19,877
Thank you, darling.

1810
01:43:21,912 --> 01:43:23,748
Fuck.

1811
01:43:25,515 --> 01:43:26,951
Primetime,
what is it, son?

1812
01:43:27,084 --> 01:43:29,887
Coach, we're gonna take
care of this for you.

1813
01:43:30,020 --> 01:43:31,387
Ernie's got a plan.

1814
01:43:31,655 --> 01:43:33,356
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1815
01:43:33,490 --> 01:43:36,727
The Michael situation.
We're gonna sort it.

1816
01:43:38,495 --> 01:43:40,097
Primetime, listen... Prime...

1817
01:43:41,564 --> 01:43:42,532
Jesus.

1818
01:43:53,677 --> 01:43:55,445
<i>Now, you
remember Aslan, don't you?</i>

1819
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:58,582
The young gentleman
you kept in the freezer?

1820
01:44:01,051 --> 01:44:05,589
Well, this is Aslan Senior,
Russian oligarch.

1821
01:44:07,091 --> 01:44:09,292
<i>Ex-KGB. Made all
his money in gas pipes.</i>

1822
01:44:09,425 --> 01:44:12,630
And he's extremely sad that his
one-and-only son fell out of a window.

1823
01:44:13,097 --> 01:44:14,598
Oh, shit.

1824
01:44:14,899 --> 01:44:16,801
And I fear that where
they failed before, Raymond,

1825
01:44:16,934 --> 01:44:19,136
they're not gonna fail again.

1826
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:21,272
And how do you know
all this?

1827
01:44:21,404 --> 01:44:24,608
Because someone told them everything
they want to know about Michael,

1828
01:44:24,742 --> 01:44:27,410
and that someone is me.

1829
01:44:28,612 --> 01:44:29,814
Go on.

1830
01:44:30,781 --> 01:44:33,516
<i>So I said I'd tell them
where Michael was for a price.</i>

1831
01:44:34,417 --> 01:44:38,222
But that money was pending till
after, you know, the deed was done.

1832
01:44:40,191 --> 01:44:41,992
<i>And then when they
messed up the first time,</i>

1833
01:44:42,126 --> 01:44:45,461
I had a little rethink and came
up with my version 2.0 plan,

1834
01:44:45,596 --> 01:44:47,497
which is
when I came to see you.

1835
01:44:47,631 --> 01:44:50,333
You see, get my 20 mils
off Michael first

1836
01:44:50,466 --> 01:44:54,872
and then, after the event,
get paid again, double bubble.

1837
01:44:55,005 --> 01:44:58,408
But you and your mysterious friend
put paid to that, so well done, you.

1838
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:00,711
Why did you just
look at your watch?

1839
01:45:02,179 --> 01:45:05,716
Well, it's like I say.
The Russians are gonna clean house.

1840
01:45:05,850 --> 01:45:08,919
And you are part of
that house, Raymond.

1841
01:45:09,053 --> 01:45:12,022
They're gonna get Michael when he comes
out of his meeting at the fish market.

1842
01:45:13,057 --> 01:45:15,659
And they are coming here.
So you see what I've done there?

1843
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:17,995
By telling you,
I've saved your lives.

1844
01:45:18,128 --> 01:45:20,097
Which I think in turn
saves mine, doesn't it?

1845
01:45:20,231 --> 01:45:21,999
Don't fucking move.

1846
01:45:29,974 --> 01:45:31,075
Dave.

1847
01:45:31,842 --> 01:45:32,943
Dave?

1848
01:45:41,986 --> 01:45:43,220
No Dave.

1849
01:45:48,325 --> 01:45:49,360
Fuck.

1850
01:45:54,832 --> 01:45:56,532

<i>The car rolls to a stop.</i>

Smash cut to black. Titles.

1870
01:47:07,338 --> 01:47:10,007
So, what happened
to Michael?

1871
01:47:11,141 --> 01:47:12,475
<i>I need an ending.</i>

1872
01:47:12,609 --> 01:47:14,211
<i>No, no, no, my darling.</i>

<i>What you need...</i>

1874
01:47:17,781 --> 01:47:19,183
is a sequel.

1875
01:47:19,482 --> 01:47:22,319
Think it over. Have a read.
You know my fee.

1876
01:47:22,453 --> 01:47:24,888
I'm off to La La
to talk to the competition.

1877
01:47:25,488 --> 01:47:28,959
Think about that.
Got a plane to catch. And I'm gone.

1878
01:47:34,031 --> 01:47:35,399
Good afternoon.

1879
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:39,636
So, it's Heathrow
Airport, please, Terminal 3,

1880
01:47:39,770 --> 01:47:42,039
and thence
to sunny California.

1881
01:47:44,241 --> 01:47:47,845
<i>Buenas tardes,
Fletcher-mondo.</i>

1882
01:47:48,412 --> 01:47:51,482
Raymond. Well, well, well.

1883
01:47:51,615 --> 01:47:53,484
A man of many vocations,
aren't you?

1884
01:48:02,993 --> 01:48:05,462
Now, I want you to play
a game with me, Fletcher.

1885
01:48:11,101 --> 01:48:12,336
He's got Fletcher.

1886
01:48:14,138 --> 01:48:15,906
<i>If you wish to be
the king of the jungle,</i>

1887
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:18,409
<i>it's not enough
to act like a king.</i>

1888
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:20,911
<i>You must be the king.</i>

1889
01:48:22,312 --> 01:48:24,248
<i>And there can be no doubt.</i>

1890
01:48:24,381 --> 01:48:27,985
<i>Because doubt causes chaos
and one's own demise.</i>

1891
01:48:29,787 --> 01:48:31,321
