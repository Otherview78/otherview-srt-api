1
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,400
Where are you going?

2
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,112
I won't be long.

3
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,095
Welcome, Signor Sciarra.

4
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:05,681
I trust you had a pleasant journey.

5
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:12,980
Do you have it?

6
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:14,523
Yes. It's over there.

7
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,698
When do we blow the stadium?

8
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,117
This evening at six.

9
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,204
And the flight out of here?

10
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,874
All arranged.

11
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,295
And then what?

12
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:40,674
Then I visit The Pale King.

13
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,470
A toast, my friend.

14
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,562
To Death!

15
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,022
Bottoms up.

16
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,137
Meet me in the square!

17
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:10,332
I've been here before

18
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:17,839
But always hit the floor

19
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:23,220
I've spent a lifetime running

20
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:27,015
And I always get away

21
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:30,727
But with you I'm feeling something

22
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:34,523
That makes me want to stay

23
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:40,862
If I risk it all

24
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,203
Could you break my fall?

25
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:52,415
How do I live? How do I breathe?

26
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,877
When you're not here I'm suffocating

27
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:59,506
I want to feel love run through my blood

28
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:03,385
Tell me is this where I give it all up?

29
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:10,725
For you I have to risk it all

30
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:17,732
'Cause the writing's on the wall

31
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:28,076
A million shards of glass

32
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:35,333
That haunt me from my past

33
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,338
As the stars begin to gather

34
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:44,050
And the light begins to fade

35
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:47,721
When all hope begins to shatter

36
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:51,850
Know that I won't be afraid

37
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:59,065
If I risk it all

38
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:04,988
Could you break my fall?

39
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:09,117
How do I live? How do I breathe?

40
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,621
When you're not here I'm suffocating

41
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:16,416
I want to feel love run through my blood

42
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:20,545
Tell me is this where I give it all up?

43
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:26,968
For you I have to risk it all

44
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:33,975
'Cause the writing's on the wall

45
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:43,485
The writing's on the wall

46
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:04,214
How do I live? How do I breathe?

47
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,842
When you're not here I'm suffocating

48
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:11,721
I want to feel love run through my blood

49
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:15,016
Tell me is this where I give it all up?

50
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:22,399
For you I have to risk it all

51
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:30,532
'Cause the writing's on

52
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:38,873
The wall

53
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,256
Start anywhere you like.

54
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,383
Take your time, 007, but in five minutes

55
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,718
the head of the Joint Security Service

56
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,011
is going to walk through that door,

57
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,262
and I've got to explain to him

58
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,598
how one of our agents decided to potter off to Mexico, all on his own,

59
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,392
and cause an international incident.

60
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,686
With all due respect, sir, it could've been worse.

61
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:01,813
Worse? You blew up half a bloody block.

62
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,399
Well, better half a block than a whole stadium full of people.

63
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,568
You had no authority.

64
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,236
None.

65
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,447
As you know, we're in the middle of the biggest shakeup

66
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,073
in the history of British intelligence.

67
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,909
The ink's barely dry on this merger with MI5

68
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,786
and already they're itching for a chance to scrap

69
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,496
the double-0 program forever.

70
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,874
And you've just given them one.

71
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,293
You're right, sir.

72
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,004
You have got a tricky day ahead.

73
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,092
This is an official question.

74
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,430
Mexico City. What were you doing there?

75
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:40,060
It was just a coincidence. I was taking some overdue holiday.

76
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,271
Okay. Fine.

77
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,608
As of this morning, you are officially grounded.

78
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:50,320
I'm standing you down from all operations indefinitely.

79
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,080
Very good, sir.

80
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,415
007?

81
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,001
Sir?

82
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:06,836
I don't know what you're playing at,

83
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,547
but whatever it is, it has to stop.

84
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:10,632
Now.

85
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,136
- So sorry. - Am I interrupting? Not remotely.

86
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,180
007, I'd like you to meet Max Denbigh,

87
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:18,640
head of the Joint Security Service.

88
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,434
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, 007. I've heard a lot about you.

89
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:22,644
Most of it good.

90
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,187
Congratulations on your new appointment.

91
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,271
Thank you.

92
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,815
I suppose we should call you C now.

93
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,817
No, no. "Max," please.

94
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,486
No, I think I'll call you C,

95
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:32,529
C.

96
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:34,823
As you wish.

97
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,660
Well, my door is always open, 007, for my employees.

98
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,663
This merger's gonna be a whole new chapter for us.

99
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:45,416
We're going to bring British intelligence out of the Dark Ages

100
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,085
into the light.

101
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,296
That all sounds lovely.

102
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,508
That'll be all, 007. Report to Q tomorrow for medical, thank you.

103
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,343
Very good, sir.

104
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,437
James?

105
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:07,522
Moneypenny.

106
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,191
So? How was the meeting?

107
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,026
Very good, thank you.

108
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:13,486
Here.

109
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,697
- Forensics finally released this. - What is it?

110
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,783
It's personal effects they recovered from Skyfall.

111
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,702
Perfect. You can bring it to me later.

112
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:23,204
- What do you mean? - My place, 9:00.

113
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,885
Evening.

114
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,178
Come in.

115
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,973
Have you just moved in?

116
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,057
No.

117
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:45,351
Well, I like what you've done with the place.

118
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,771
Your delivery.

119
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,232
Thank you.

120
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,445
Would you like a drink?

121
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,071
No, thanks. I'm not staying.

122
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,323
That's a shame.

123
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,950
What's going on, James?

124
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:05,496
There's not one person at MI6 who isn't talking about it.

125
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,208
Talking about what, exactly?

126
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:12,045
That what you did in Mexico was one step too far.

127
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,797
That you're finished.

128
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,257
And what do you think?

129
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:18,760
I think you're just getting started.

130
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,096
I don't know what you mean.

131
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,598
All right.

132
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,976
I think you've got a secret.

133
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:30,605
And it's something you won't tell anyone.

134
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,483
Because you don't trust anyone.

135
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:48,248
If anything happens to me, 007, I need you to do something.

136
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:52,085
Find a man called Marco Sciarra.

137
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,504
Kill him.

138
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:57,298
And don't miss the funeral.

139
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,803
Jesus.

140
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,138
Where did you get it?

141
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,724
In my mailbox just after she died.

142
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,602
Well, she was never short of surprises.

143
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,189
She wasn't gonna let death get in the way of her job.

144
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,568
I've been tracking Sciarra ever since.

145
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:18,987
And what have you found?

146
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,406
Nothing significant yet.

147
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:22,907
When's the funeral?

148
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,202
Three days. In Rome.

149
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:29,289
If you think M's signing off on that, you're insane.

150
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:30,873
He won't let you out of his sight.

151
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,167
Yes, it's a bit of a problem.

152
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,585
Listen.

153
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,964
Could you do a little quiet digging for me?

154
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,009
I heard a name in Mexico. "The Pale King."

155
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,305
You want me to be your mole.

156
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,099
Yes.

157
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,229
And what makes you think you can trust me?

158
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:57,191
Instinct.

159
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:00,922
TANNER: Poor old girl. Rigged for demolition in a week.

160
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,176
Cheaper to knock her down than to rebuild.

161
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:06,928
Still.

162
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,514
Time waits for no man and all that.

163
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:13,267
Anyway, all the money's been spent on this,

164
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,854
the New Centre for National Security.

165
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,691
BOND: So that's C's new digs.

166
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,527
You've met him, have you?

167
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,779
Yesterday. What do we know about him?

168
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,989
Classic Whitehall mandarin.

169
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,241
Wrote a dossier last year

170
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,284
on how the double-0 program was obsolete,

171
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:33,371
how drones could do all our dirty work abroad.

172
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,248
Went to school with the Home Secretary.

173
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,791
Of course, he did.

174
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:39,127
This merger's just the start of it.

175
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,587
In three days, there's a security conference in Tokyo

176
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,923
to decide the New World Order.

177
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:46,175
If C gets his way, he'll have unlimited access

178
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,970
to the combined intelligence streams of nine countries.

179
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,304
Including us.

180
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,514
Quite.

181
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:03,151
Well, a lot's happened while you were away.

182
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:07,321
A train bombing in Hamburg and an industrial explosion in Tunisia.

183
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:08,823
It's not great timing for us.

184
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,784
It's all rather playing into C's hands.

185
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:15,746
M, well, let's say he's feeling the pressure.

186
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,498
Yeah, I've noticed.

187
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:19,375
Now, this way, 007.

188
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,961
Be careful. It's a trifle slippery.

189
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,175
Q wasn't exactly feeling at home in Whitehall,

190
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,217
what with the new merger,

191
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:32,430
so he set up shop here, away from prying eyes, as it were.

192
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:35,349
I hear he's got something rather special planned for you.

193
00:24:35,433 --> 00:24:37,101
I can hardly wait.

194
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,988
Ah, 007.

195
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,533
- Q. - Q: Please excuse the mess.

196
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:54,118
Everything's a little bit up in the air,

197
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:55,453
what with the changes and all.

198
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,872
Couple of things to get through.

199
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,541
Shall we get started?

200
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,502
Just relax.

201
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:05,338
That's it. Lovely.

202
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,507
Now, you may feel a small...

203
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:08,591
Christ!

204
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,009
...prick.

205
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,304
What is it?

206
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,097
Q: Cutting-edge nanotechnology.

207
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,807
Smart Blood.

208
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:20,019
Microchips in your bloodstream.

209
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:23,147
Allows us to track your movements in the field.

210
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,525
You see those readouts?

211
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:29,237
We can monitor your vital signs from anywhere on the planet.

212
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,447
Well, that sounds marvelous.

213
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:34,700
Call it a post-Mexico insurance policy.

214
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,285
By direct order of M.

215
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,248
I completely understand.

216
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:42,917
Good.

217
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,922
Right. Well, I've just, um, got one last thing for you

218
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:49,507
and you can be on your way.

219
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,349
Magnificent, isn't she?

220
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:01,060
Zero to 60 in three point two seconds.

221
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:04,480
Fully bulletproof. A few little tricks up her sleeve.

222
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,275
It's a shame, really. She was meant for you,

223
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,236
but she's been reassigned to 009.

224
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:13,406
But you can have this.

225
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,580
Does it do anything?

226
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,290
It tells the time.

227
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,709
Might help with your punctuality issues.

228
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,669
- M's idea? - Precisely.

229
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:31,799
Oh, one word of warning. The alarm is rather loud.

230
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,427
If you know what I mean.

231
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:35,970
I think I do.

232
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:45,146
Oh, yes. That old thing is taking quite a bit of time.

233
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,982
Mind you, there wasn't much left to work on.

234
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,984
Only a steering wheel.

235
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:54,322
I believe I said, "Bring it back in one piece," not, "Bring back one piece."

236
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:02,246
Anyway, enjoy your downtime, 007.

237
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:06,250
- Q? - Q: Yes?

238
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:10,880
Well, now you know exactly where I am all of the time.

239
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:13,841
Will you do something for me?

240
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,344
What do you have in mind, exactly?

241
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:18,679
Make me disappear.

242
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:25,269
May I remind you that I answer directly to M.

243
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:28,481
I also have a mortgage. And two cats to feed.

244
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:31,192
Well, then I suggest you trust me,

245
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:33,527
for the sake of the cats.

246
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:41,118
Well, it's lovely to see you, 007. Lovely.

247
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,662
Um, now, I meant to tell you,

248
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:46,540
the Smart Blood program is obviously still in its developmental phase.

249
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:51,712
So we may experience the odd drop in coverage during the first 24 hours...

250
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,134
48 hours after administration,

251
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:59,887
but after that it should work perfectly.

252
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,098
I'll send you a postcard.

253
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,141
Please, don't.

254
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:34,296
Morning.

255
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,007
- What's that? - Oh, it's just something from an admirer.

256
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:38,592
It's not your birthday, is it?

257
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,261
No, sir.

258
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:43,180
That was last week.

259
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:44,598
Q: Morning.

260
00:28:44,682 --> 00:28:48,561
009 has arrived to pick up the DB10, sir. He's waiting upstairs.

261
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:50,438
Oh, good. Yes, fine.

262
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,204
Oh, shit.

263
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,038
BOND: I'm sorry for your loss.

264
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,084
You knew my husband?

265
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,627
All too briefly.

266
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:20,671
What do you do?

267
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,673
Life insurance.

268
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,217
A little late for that.

269
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:27,136
For your husband, yes.

270
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,597
But what about you?

271
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,599
Me?

272
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:35,936
I hear the life expectancy of some widows can be very short.

273
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:39,273
How can you talk like this?

274
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:41,775
Can't you see I'm grieving?

275
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:43,652
No.

276
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,502
What a lovely view.

277
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,964
You're wasting your time.

278
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:12,009
There are 100 more that will come after me.

279
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:15,429
All you buy me is five minutes.

280
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:17,848
Excellent.

281
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:19,975
Time for a drink.

282
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:31,570
You killed him,

283
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,697
didn't you?

284
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:35,074
My husband.

285
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,367
He was an assassin.

286
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,661
Trust me, he won't take it personally.

287
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:46,502
You signed my death warrant. I was respected.

288
00:34:46,627 --> 00:34:48,087
Loyal to a man you hated.

289
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:49,838
He trusted my silence.

290
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:52,174
With him gone, I'm a dead woman.

291
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,383
I can trust nobody.

292
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:54,468
I know the feeling well.

293
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:57,137
Well, I can tell you that I don't trust you.

294
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:59,306
Well, then you have impeccable instincts.

295
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,934
If you don't leave now, we'll die together.

296
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,897
I can think of worse ways to go.

297
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:12,069
Then you're obviously crazy, Mister...

298
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:15,197
Bond.

299
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,700
James Bond.

300
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:29,837
These people,

301
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,966
if you just knew what they could do.

302
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,177
The power they have.

303
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:40,848
Did your husband ever mention "The Pale King?"

304
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,016
No.

305
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:46,770
The organization,

306
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,190
they hardly ever meet.

307
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:55,863
But because of what happened to my husband,

308
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:57,865
they meet tonight.

309
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,074
Why?

310
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,827
To choose a replacement.

311
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:03,704
Where?

312
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,374
The Palazzo Cardenza.

313
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:09,543
- Midnight. - Sounds like fun.

314
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,461
I might drop by.

315
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,007
He was obsessed.

316
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:18,510
He spent more time with them than with me.

317
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,307
Then the man was a fool.

318
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:36,403
LUCIA: Leaving your number?

319
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:39,531
BOND: I've called an American friend of mine. Felix.

320
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,284
He'll contact his embassy and get you out of here.

321
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,911
You'll be safe.

322
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,378
Don't go, James.

323
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,089
If you go there,

324
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:59,051
you're crossing over to a place where there is no mercy.

325
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,677
I have to go.

326
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,277
Identify yourself, asshole.

327
00:37:58,944 --> 00:37:59,820
Who are you?

328
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:02,948
I'm Mickey Mouse. Who are you?

329
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:22,676
MAN:...pharmacy sites has provided

330
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,928
an excellent new sales platform.

331
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:29,433
We have adapted many of them into clearinghouses for unapproved drugs.

332
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,476
In addition to which,

333
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:34,146
the latest figures show that we presently control

334
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,523
70% of antimalarial vaccines,

335
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:42,321
34% of H.I.V., and 40% of all oncological drugs

336
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,781
across Sub-Saharan Africa.

337
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,535
But we face challenges from the WHO

338
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:52,372
in their campaign against our counterfeit pharmaceuticals.

339
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:56,335
We have now identified the key individuals to target.

340
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:58,795
We expect the same success as we had

341
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:01,214
against the Council on Human Trafficking.

342
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:05,594
Since the board's resignation...

343
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:10,724
..we have placed 160,000 migrated females into the leisure sector.

344
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:14,478
The impending completion of the Global Surveillance initiative...

345
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:19,066
...will mean our capability is second to none...

346
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:23,862
...and now is the moment for aggressive expansion.

347
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,906
The news is only good....

348
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:01,858
OBERHAUSER: Don't let me interrupt you.

349
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,704
The news is only good....

350
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:18,500
Our increased surveillance capability...

351
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,294
...means government intelligence agencies...

352
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:23,422
...are easily counteracted.

353
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:26,049
We are winning.

354
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:27,926
MAN: Thank you, Doctor.

355
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:30,846
Now, on to the matter at hand.

356
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:35,016
After the success of our attacks in Hamburg and Tunisia,

357
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,519
the aborted attack in Mexico City

358
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:41,523
and the death of our valued colleague, Marco Sciarra,

359
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,651
leaves one of his duties outstanding.

360
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:48,196
Signor Guerra, The Pale King must be terminated.

361
00:40:48,864 --> 00:40:51,575
Will you make the journey to Altaussee?

362
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:57,581
Of course.

363
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,416
My loyalty to this organization is total.

364
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:02,794
I will protect it with my last breath.

365
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:05,464
There will be no more...

366
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:08,133
...amateurs.

367
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:11,803
No more shows of weakness.

368
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:50,383
Does anyone challenge Signor Guerra for this position?

369
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,785
Welcome.

370
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:19,621
State your credentials for succeeding Signor Sciarra.

371
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:14,968
OBERHAUSER: It's funny.

372
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:21,641
All that excitement in Mexico City rang a distant bell.

373
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:25,020
And now,

374
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:29,816
suddenly, this evening, it makes perfect sense.

375
00:43:35,322 --> 00:43:37,157
Welcome, James.

376
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,704
It's been a long time.

377
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:46,333
But, finally, here we are.

378
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:52,380
What took you so long?

379
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,848
Cuckoo.

380
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:06,478
Ciao, Mickey Mouse.

381
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,891
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

382
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,161
No.

383
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:18,109
- -

384
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:55,855
Moneypenny.

385
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:00,860
Bond?

386
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:02,695
Listen, Moneypenny. Hamburg, Tunisia,

387
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:04,489
Mexico City, they're all linked.

388
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:07,242
It's one organization coordinating multiple attacks.

389
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:08,618
So, she was right.

390
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:09,869
Of course, she was.

391
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:11,955
- I ran that check. - MAN: Who is it?

392
00:47:13,206 --> 00:47:16,501
Oh, my boss had his credit card stolen.

393
00:47:16,543 --> 00:47:18,837
It's nothing. Why don't you go back to sleep.

394
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:19,879
Don't be long.

395
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:21,548
- Who was that? - MONEYPENNY: No one.

396
00:47:21,798 --> 00:47:23,049
BOND: No, it wasn't.

397
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:24,300
It's just a friend.

398
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:25,552
At this time of night?

399
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:28,721
It's called life, James. You should try it sometime.

400
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,690
MONEYPENNY: The Pale King. It looks like you've had dealings with him before.

401
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,066
- Quantum. - Of course.

402
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:42,151
- Mr. White! - That's him.

403
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:47,448
Last unconfirmed sighting, Altaussee in Austria, four months ago.

404
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,242
Hold that thought.

405
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:51,578
- -

406
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:04,090
- You still there? - Yeah.

407
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:05,550
Run another name, will you?

408
00:48:05,592 --> 00:48:07,427
Okay. Go.

409
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,430
A man called Franz Oberhauser. He's...

410
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:16,060
And check his files before and after his death.

411
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:17,896
After his death? What are you talking about?

412
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:19,856
Please, just do it.

413
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:47,068
Okay, Q, give me something.

414
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,790
That's more like it.

415
00:50:06,963 --> 00:50:08,089
Here goes nothing.

416
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,169
Good evening.

417
00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:06,689
C: Do not let them tell you we need less surveillance.

418
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:09,609
We need more. Much more.

419
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:14,614
I say again, the Nine Eyes committee would have full access

420
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:17,909
to the combined intelligence streams of all member states.

421
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,119
More data, more analysis,

422
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:23,331
less likelihood of a terrorist attack.

423
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:25,708
Ladies and gentlemen,

424
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:28,419
it's time for the security services of the world to unite.

425
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:31,964
Alone, we are weak.

426
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:35,885
Together, we're a global power.

427
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,804
An unelected one.

428
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,598
Thank you.

429
00:51:41,808 --> 00:51:42,975
Thank you.

430
00:51:43,768 --> 00:51:45,728
We will now vote on the resolution.

431
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:49,148
Ladies and gentlemen, please cast your vote.

432
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:56,489
The vote is eight to one in favor.

433
00:51:56,906 --> 00:51:58,658
However, as you know,

434
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:01,661
we cannot proceed unless by unanimous vote.

435
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:04,914
The Nine Eyes motion is therefore not passed.

436
00:52:05,832 --> 00:52:06,999
Democracy.

437
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:08,084
CHAIRMAN: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

438
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:09,752
- This evening's session is adjourned. -

439
00:52:25,935 --> 00:52:26,936
Yes, sir.

440
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:29,355
Please, tell me 007 is in London.

441
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:30,523
Q: Oh, yes.

442
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:33,401
Um, I'll just take a look now, sir.

443
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,361
Because if he isn't, you're in deep shit.

444
00:52:37,155 --> 00:52:38,865
You've got precisely 10 seconds.

445
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,788
I have him, sir. He appears to be in Chelsea.

446
00:52:45,872 --> 00:52:49,208
Well, I want eyes on him when I get back, understood?

447
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,627
I completely understand,

448
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:53,880
sir.

449
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:17,898
- -

450
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:49,096
Do me a favor. Make it quick.

451
00:55:49,555 --> 00:55:51,307
Upstairs, Mr. White.

452
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:05,488
I always knew death would wear a familiar face,

453
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,073
but not yours.

454
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:10,076
To what do I owe this pleasure, Mr. Bond?

455
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:14,747
I was at a meeting recently

456
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,707
and your name came up.

457
00:56:16,832 --> 00:56:19,794
I'm flattered London is still talking about me.

458
00:56:19,877 --> 00:56:21,337
It wasn't MI6.

459
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:23,714
It was Rome.

460
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:26,884
Your team, not mine.

461
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:28,260
Ah.

462
00:56:32,932 --> 00:56:37,269
Last month, I found thallium in my cell phone.

463
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:41,899
It's done its job. I have a few weeks. Maybe less.

464
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:47,321
So, here we are, Mr. Bond,

465
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,449
two dead men enjoying the evening.

466
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,743
What did you do?

467
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:54,412
I disobeyed him.

468
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:58,249
I followed him as far as I could.

469
00:56:58,958 --> 00:57:00,209
He changed.

470
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:01,877
Oh, I see.

471
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,213
You grew a conscience.

472
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:07,716
Our game is our game. But this?

473
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:10,928
Women, children...

474
00:57:11,554 --> 00:57:12,847
Well, the thallium would suggest

475
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,974
that he doesn't like you very much anymore.

476
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:16,976
And clearly the feeling is mutual.

477
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:19,228
So why don't you tell me how to find him again?

478
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:20,312
Oh, come on.

479
00:57:21,397 --> 00:57:22,857
Tell me where he is.

480
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,650
He's everywhere.

481
00:57:24,984 --> 00:57:26,026
Everywhere!

482
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:28,320
He's sitting at your desk,

483
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:31,574
he's kissing your lover, he's eating supper with your family!

484
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:41,083
You're protecting someone.

485
00:57:42,168 --> 00:57:43,169
Your wife.

486
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:48,507
She left long ago.

487
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:50,551
Your son?

488
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,348
Your daughter.

489
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:00,311
You won't find her.

490
00:58:00,352 --> 00:58:01,854
She's clever.

491
00:58:01,896 --> 00:58:05,024
She's smarter than me. She knows how to hide.

492
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:09,111
I can protect her if you tell me where he is.

493
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,449
I can keep her alive.

494
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:14,700
Yeah.

495
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,871
You have my word.

496
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:20,164
Your word?

497
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,042
The word of an assassin!

498
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,056
That's my word.

499
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:06,460
L'Américain.

500
00:59:07,503 --> 00:59:09,296
You save her,

501
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:12,049
she can lead you to L'Américain. She knows L'Américain.

502
00:59:13,259 --> 00:59:15,344
Try the Hoffler Klinik.

503
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:26,605
You're a kite dancing in a hurricane, Mr. Bond.

504
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:30,943
So long.

505
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:27,499
M: I can't deny I'm impressed you got H.M.G. to cough up for all this.

506
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:30,002
C: Good God, the government couldn't afford this kind of facility.

507
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:32,796
No, it was benefactors mostly, from the private sector.

508
01:00:33,339 --> 01:00:34,381
When it goes online,

509
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:36,258
this building will be the most sophisticated

510
01:00:36,342 --> 01:00:38,344
data gathering system in history.

511
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:41,388
The world's digital ghost, available 24/7.

512
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:43,140
George Orwell's worst nightmare.

513
01:00:43,182 --> 01:00:44,350
I'm glad you like it.

514
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,686
My commiserations on losing the Nine Eyes vote.

515
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:48,854
Must have been a blow.

516
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:51,148
Not really. Only a matter of time

517
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:52,441
before the South Africans see the light.

518
01:00:52,524 --> 01:00:54,735
And you know what they say, Rome wasn't built in a day.

519
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:55,819
Day and a half maybe.

520
01:00:56,862 --> 01:01:00,032
Look, Max, I know surveillance is a fact of life.

521
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:04,244
It's how you use the information that concerns me,

522
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:05,788
and who is using it.

523
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:07,998
This is what we need to do to keep the people safe.

524
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:11,377
Double-0 program is prehistoric.

525
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:14,463
Come on, M. You can't really tell me that one man in the field

526
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:16,256
can compete with all of this,

527
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:19,051
running around out there with his license to kill.

528
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:22,304
Have you ever had to kill a man, Max?

529
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:25,140
Have you?

530
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:27,893
To pull that trigger, you have to be sure.

531
01:01:28,227 --> 01:01:31,980
Yes, you investigate, analyze, assess, target.

532
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:35,192
And then you have to look him in the eye.

533
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,278
And you make the call.

534
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:41,907
And all the drones, bugs, cameras, transcripts,

535
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:43,992
all the surveillance in the world

536
01:01:44,076 --> 01:01:46,453
can't tell you what to do next.

537
01:01:48,414 --> 01:01:50,165
A license to kill

538
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:53,752
is also a license not to kill.

539
01:01:55,671 --> 01:01:58,090
I didn't want to have to do this,

540
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:02,177
but it looks like you still can't control your agents.

541
01:02:03,429 --> 01:02:05,597
MONEYPENNY: Bond? I ran that check.

542
01:02:07,141 --> 01:02:09,852
Looks like you've had dealings with him before. Quantum.

543
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:11,729
BOND: Of course. Mr. White!

544
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:15,274
MONEYPENNY: Last unconfirmed sighting, Altaussee in Austria.

545
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:16,817
BOND: Run another name, will you?

546
01:02:18,026 --> 01:02:19,236
C: So maybe there's something to be said

547
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:21,238
for total surveillance after all.

548
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:26,493
You watch MI6 agents?

549
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:29,705
We watch everyone.

550
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:37,356
SWANN: Please, take a seat.

551
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:39,483
I'll be with you in just a moment.

552
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:57,918
Please excuse me, Mr. Bond.

553
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:02,714
My name is Dr. Madeleine Swann.

554
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:04,633
Our job today is to analyze your needs,

555
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:07,219
both psychological and physical.

556
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:09,012
Hmm, sounds pretty straightforward.

557
01:04:10,222 --> 01:04:12,683
I hope you don't mind. The view can be distracting.

558
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,393
I hadn't noticed.

559
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:23,485
I see you filled out most of the paperwork.

560
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:27,739
Just a few questions to complete your evaluation, if I may.

561
01:04:28,282 --> 01:04:29,908
Do you exercise?

562
01:04:30,284 --> 01:04:31,493
When I have to.

563
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:35,247
Do you consider your employment to be psychologically stressful?

564
01:04:36,248 --> 01:04:37,332
Sometimes.

565
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:39,376
How much alcohol do you consume?

566
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:41,545
Too much.

567
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:46,008
Some broader questions.

568
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:48,260
As a child, would you say you were close to your parents?

569
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:51,096
My parents died when I was young.

570
01:04:51,972 --> 01:04:53,599
Really? How old?

571
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:55,601
Old enough to remember.

572
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:57,394
How, if I may ask?

573
01:04:57,436 --> 01:04:58,854
It was a climbing accident.

574
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:00,772
So who brought you up?

575
01:05:00,856 --> 01:05:02,357
Someone else.

576
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:04,359
Humor me.

577
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:09,114
How does one train at Oxford and the Sorbonne become a consultant,

578
01:05:09,156 --> 01:05:12,200
spend two years with Médecins Sans Frontières

579
01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:13,869
and end up here?

580
01:05:15,037 --> 01:05:17,372
Forgive me, but anyone might think

581
01:05:17,456 --> 01:05:19,124
you were hiding from something.

582
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,378
You're paying a lot of money to be here, Mr. Bond.

583
01:05:23,462 --> 01:05:25,881
Who's asking the questions, you or me?

584
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:27,966
Of course. Carry on.

585
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:34,348
I see you left this final question blank.

586
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:36,475
What is your occupation?

587
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:40,354
Well, that's not the sort of thing that looks good on a form.

588
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:41,647
And why is that?

589
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:42,731
I kill people.

590
01:05:45,901 --> 01:05:47,110
Small world?

591
01:05:49,738 --> 01:05:50,822
Where is he?

592
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:52,824
Your father's dead.

593
01:05:53,075 --> 01:05:54,576
Two days ago.

594
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,203
How do you know?

595
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:57,829
Because I was there.

596
01:05:58,413 --> 01:05:59,498
Did you kill him?

597
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:00,624
I didn't have to.

598
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:03,001
He did it himself.

599
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:06,838
And you came all the way just to tell me this?

600
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,882
That my father's dead?

601
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:12,970
I came to tell you that your life is in danger and I need your help.

602
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:16,848
- Why? - I made a deal with him to protect you.

603
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:19,476
You're lying.

604
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:21,353
Why would he trust you?

605
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:24,481
Because he knew that I needed something in return.

606
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:26,108
And what was that?

607
01:06:26,858 --> 01:06:28,276
To find L'Américain.

608
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:30,988
This interview is over.

609
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:32,280
Dr. Swann...

610
01:06:32,364 --> 01:06:36,576
You have 10 minutes to leave the building. Then I'm calling security.

611
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:41,999
Thank you, Dr. Swann.

612
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:05,772
Can I get you something, sir?

613
01:07:05,856 --> 01:07:08,358
Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred.

614
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,986
I'm sorry, we don't serve alcohol.

615
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,697
I'm really starting to love this place.

616
01:07:13,739 --> 01:07:16,116
He'll have the prolytic digestive enzyme shake.

617
01:07:16,408 --> 01:07:17,451
Certainly.

618
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,161
If you've come for the car,

619
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:20,871
I parked it at the bottom of the Tiber.

620
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:23,915
Well, not to worry, 007. It was only a £3,000,000 prototype.

621
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:25,375
Why are you here, Q?

622
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:27,377
Oh, I just fancied a break, to be honest.

623
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:29,254
I've been a tad stressed at work recently.

624
01:07:29,588 --> 01:07:31,548
What with C's people crawling all over us

625
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:33,550
and the fact that M wants my balls for Christmas decorations.

626
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:35,761
- Get to the point. - The point, 007,

627
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:37,929
is that Franz Oberhauser is dead.

628
01:07:38,013 --> 01:07:39,514
Dead and buried.

629
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:40,932
And unless you come back with me right now,

630
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,935
my career and Moneypenny's will go the same way.

631
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,938
Do you understand? All hell is breaking loose out there and...

632
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,608
- I saw him. - You thought you saw him.

633
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:51,276
We've been through the records.

634
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,987
He died in an avalanche with his father 20 years ago.

635
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:56,031
Yes. I know that.

636
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:57,532
But I saw him.

637
01:07:59,618 --> 01:08:01,578
He's not someone I'll ever forget.

638
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,248
So you have a lead?

639
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:07,084
I have a name. L'Américain.

640
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:10,003
Well, that narrows it down.

641
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:12,380
Look, I'm sorry, 007, but time's up.

642
01:08:12,464 --> 01:08:14,508
My whole career is on the line here.

643
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:17,010
Either you come back in and do this through proper channels,

644
01:08:17,094 --> 01:08:18,261
or I go directly to M.

645
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,972
Do one more thing for me. Then you're out.

646
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:24,351
Find out what you can from this.

647
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:34,319
I really, really hate you right now.

648
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:36,196
Thank you, Q.

649
01:08:37,364 --> 01:08:39,491
Monsieur? Now? Please?

650
01:08:39,533 --> 01:08:40,617
Where are you staying?

651
01:08:40,659 --> 01:08:41,743
The Pevsner. Room 12.

652
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:43,078
One hour.

653
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:47,958
Here you are, sir. One prolytic digestive enzyme shake.

654
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:49,543
Do me a favor, will you?

655
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:51,753
Throw that down the toilet.

656
01:08:51,837 --> 01:08:53,255
Cut out the middleman.

657
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:02,681
- -

658
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:04,057
No! Stay.

659
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:56,484
What do you want?

660
01:09:59,738 --> 01:10:00,989
What are you doing?

661
01:10:02,616 --> 01:10:04,284
Can't any of you speak?

662
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:32,283
Come on!

663
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:33,219
Argh, don't touch me!

664
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:35,054
Hey!

665
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:38,516
You need to take a breath and calm down. You're in shock.

666
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:41,352
Get away from me! Just get away!

667
01:14:41,478 --> 01:14:43,855
Did it cross your mind that you led them to me?

668
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:50,570
I haven't got time for this.

669
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:54,532
You need to tell me everything you know about L'Américain.

670
01:14:54,741 --> 01:14:56,075
Go to hell!

671
01:14:59,204 --> 01:15:00,872
I gave your father my word!

672
01:15:03,208 --> 01:15:06,544
And why should I trust you? Because my father did?

673
01:15:07,337 --> 01:15:09,547
Because right now, Dr. Swann,

674
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:13,885
I'm your best chance of staying alive.

675
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:38,826
Dr. Swann, Q.

676
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:40,954
Q, Dr. Swann.

677
01:15:41,663 --> 01:15:43,581
- Hello. - Enchanted.

678
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:48,294
Bond, we need to talk. Alone.

679
01:15:48,378 --> 01:15:49,504
She knows.

680
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:51,548
- But, Bond... - She knows.

681
01:15:52,382 --> 01:15:53,508
What have you got?

682
01:15:54,259 --> 01:15:56,427
I owe you an apology, 007.

683
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:59,138
You are onto something.

684
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:01,474
Oberhauser is still alive. The ring proves it.

685
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:05,270
And it seems they were all part of one organization.

686
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:09,941
Le Chiffre, Quantum, Sciarra, your friend Mr. Silva.

687
01:16:10,275 --> 01:16:11,985
And do you know who links them all?

688
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:13,278
BOND: Him.

689
01:16:13,528 --> 01:16:14,862
Exactly.

690
01:16:14,946 --> 01:16:18,366
This organization, do you know what it's called?

691
01:16:18,825 --> 01:16:19,951
- No. - SWANN: Spectre.

692
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:24,872
Its name is Spectre.

693
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:26,291
How does she know that?

694
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:28,626
Because my father was part of it.

695
01:16:29,586 --> 01:16:31,546
Then I think that you ought to see this.

696
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:34,340
REPORTER: You're looking at pictures from South Africa right now

697
01:16:34,424 --> 01:16:36,384
of what appears to be a huge explosion.

698
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:39,012
Q, go back to London.

699
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:43,349
M's gonna need your help. And keep tracking me.

700
01:16:43,433 --> 01:16:44,642
Q: I will.

701
01:16:45,059 --> 01:16:47,270
And, Bond, you have to find L'Américain.

702
01:16:48,313 --> 01:16:50,356
He's our only link to Oberhauser.

703
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:51,733
It's not a person.

704
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:54,569
It's a place.

705
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:01,219
Thank you.

706
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:35,086
This is where they spent their wedding night.

707
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:38,923
They came back every year.

708
01:18:39,841 --> 01:18:41,718
Then they brought me with them, too.

709
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:48,099
He kept coming back, even after the divorce.

710
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:52,270
Well, then I'm sorry.

711
01:18:53,271 --> 01:18:54,313
What for?

712
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:09,787
Ah-ha!

713
01:19:10,455 --> 01:19:11,789
SWANN: What is it?

714
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:15,543
It's your inheritance.

715
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:18,379
- Want some? - No, thank you.

716
01:19:20,131 --> 01:19:22,633
You don't know what you're missing.

717
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:33,102
This can't be it.

718
01:19:34,312 --> 01:19:36,439
Well, here's to your father.

719
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:42,320
I promised myself I would never be hurt by that man again.

720
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:45,823
I cut off all contact.

721
01:19:46,657 --> 01:19:50,161
I didn't want anything to do with him or his sick life.

722
01:19:51,329 --> 01:19:53,664
And then, with his dying breath

723
01:19:54,332 --> 01:19:55,958
he sends me you.

724
01:19:57,293 --> 01:19:58,836
Ironic, no?

725
01:19:58,878 --> 01:20:01,214
You shouldn't be so hard on him.

726
01:20:01,506 --> 01:20:04,717
The man I just met should have been dead weeks ago.

727
01:20:04,801 --> 01:20:07,553
The only reason his heart was still beating was you.

728
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:11,516
I'll mourn my father in my own time, Mr. Bond.

729
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:15,061
And, now, I'm going to bed.

730
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:19,273
- - BOTH: Oh.

731
01:20:22,527 --> 01:20:26,739
Don't think for one moment this is where I fall into your arms,

732
01:20:27,698 --> 01:20:30,576
seeking solace for my dead daddy.

733
01:20:34,705 --> 01:20:36,207
You sit there.

734
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:39,710
Keep watch. That's what you're good at.

735
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:47,426
Come anywhere near me and I'll kill you.

736
01:20:47,677 --> 01:20:49,136
I don't doubt it.

737
01:20:59,981 --> 01:21:02,817
Look. There are two of you.

738
01:21:04,277 --> 01:21:05,820
Two Jameses.

739
01:21:07,238 --> 01:21:08,865
Lucky me.

740
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:16,247
What am I doing here?

741
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:26,841
To liars...

742
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:28,926
...and killers.

743
01:21:28,968 --> 01:21:31,137
To liars...

744
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,264
...and killers...

745
01:21:33,306 --> 01:21:35,308
...everywhere.

746
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:09,091
Who sent you?

747
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:14,221
Who are you working for?

748
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:53,886
Now, where did you go?

749
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:24,375
Of course.

750
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:48,959
What is it?

751
01:24:51,796 --> 01:24:53,089
Nothing.

752
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:08,854
What's this?

753
01:25:09,522 --> 01:25:11,148
It's coordinates.

754
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:16,987
Your father was scanning for a particular satellite phone.

755
01:25:17,071 --> 01:25:19,156
He was looking for someone.

756
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:22,785
He was looking for him.

757
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:26,997
And he sent me here to finish the job.

758
01:25:28,999 --> 01:25:30,918
- I'm coming with you. - No, you're not.

759
01:25:32,002 --> 01:25:33,337
I like you alive.

760
01:25:33,379 --> 01:25:34,880
I can look after myself.

761
01:25:34,964 --> 01:25:36,674
That's beside the point.

762
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:39,802
I might not be coming back.

763
01:25:40,219 --> 01:25:41,428
I know.

764
01:25:42,388 --> 01:25:45,683
But I want to understand what happened to my father.

765
01:26:03,868 --> 01:26:06,036
So, where was he going?

766
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:10,958
Nowhere.

767
01:26:23,429 --> 01:26:26,098
Thank you so much. Thanks. All the very best.

768
01:26:26,182 --> 01:26:27,183
What's going on?

769
01:26:27,224 --> 01:26:29,143
The meeting was brought forward. Did you not get the message?

770
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:30,311
No, we didn't.

771
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:31,562
Shortest meeting I can remember.

772
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:33,314
South Africans on board, I take it?

773
01:26:33,397 --> 01:26:35,232
Yeah, well, who can blame them?

774
01:26:35,733 --> 01:26:37,902
Nine Eyes is now officially sanctioned.

775
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:40,529
The new system goes live in less than 72 hours.

776
01:26:40,571 --> 01:26:42,573
It's a major step forward.

777
01:26:42,615 --> 01:26:44,450
Global intelligence cooperation changes everything.

778
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,243
As you said before.

779
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:49,205
Look.

780
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:52,208
They've asked me to head the new committee.

781
01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:54,126
Yes? And?

782
01:26:54,210 --> 01:26:57,838
And I should tell you I've spoken with the Home Secretary.

783
01:26:58,005 --> 01:27:00,674
And in light of the new information I've given him,

784
01:27:00,758 --> 01:27:03,802
he's decided to close down the double-0 program with immediate effect.

785
01:27:04,261 --> 01:27:05,429
You don't know what you're doing.

786
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:07,431
It's not personal.

787
01:27:07,514 --> 01:27:09,099
It's the future.

788
01:27:09,516 --> 01:27:10,768
And...

789
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,271
You're not.

790
01:27:14,313 --> 01:27:16,106
You're a cocky little bastard, aren't you?

791
01:27:18,442 --> 01:27:20,069
I'll take that as a compliment.

792
01:27:20,277 --> 01:27:21,654
I wouldn't.

793
01:27:22,696 --> 01:27:24,406
This isn't over yet.

794
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:45,678
- Would you press this for me? Thank you. - Yes, sir.

795
01:28:04,822 --> 01:28:06,198
Pick it up.

796
01:28:07,449 --> 01:28:08,826
I hate guns.

797
01:28:09,326 --> 01:28:11,662
I promised him I'd protect you.

798
01:28:11,704 --> 01:28:14,415
The first thing to do is to teach you how to protect yourself.

799
01:28:14,832 --> 01:28:16,834
What if I shoot you by mistake?

800
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:19,295
Wouldn't be the first time.

801
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:20,921
Pick it up.

802
01:28:21,005 --> 01:28:22,923
I said, I hate guns.

803
01:28:28,595 --> 01:28:30,264
SIG 226.

804
01:28:30,556 --> 01:28:33,183
Front sight. Rear sight. Hammer.

805
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:41,233
You just point it. You squeeze the trigger.

806
01:28:41,317 --> 01:28:43,527
You try not to close your eyes.

807
01:28:44,194 --> 01:28:46,864
Please, try it.

808
01:29:12,056 --> 01:29:14,725
I don't have to teach you anything, do I?

809
01:29:16,727 --> 01:29:19,813
A man once came to our house to kill my father.

810
01:29:20,481 --> 01:29:23,650
He didn't know I was upstairs playing in my bedroom.

811
01:29:23,734 --> 01:29:26,070
Or that Papa kept a Beretta Nine-millimeter

812
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:28,280
under the sink with the bleach.

813
01:29:31,575 --> 01:29:33,494
That's why I hate guns.

814
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:37,456
I think we'll skip hand-to-hand combat.

815
01:29:55,432 --> 01:29:56,558
MONEYPENNY: Good evening, sir.

816
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,685
Sorry to interrupt your supper, but we have some news.

817
01:29:58,769 --> 01:30:00,270
Q: Evening, sir.

818
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:02,773
Using the Smart Blood, I've tracked Bond

819
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:05,401
to a point here in North Africa.

820
01:30:06,652 --> 01:30:09,321
See, every known map registers it as empty desert.

821
01:30:09,405 --> 01:30:13,242
Exactly. But if you look at the satellite blowup, you can clearly see this.

822
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:14,910
We can't help him.

823
01:30:16,286 --> 01:30:17,746
But, sir, we know where he's heading.

824
01:30:19,748 --> 01:30:21,625
C is watching everything we do.

825
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:24,294
We're only handing them more information.

826
01:30:27,548 --> 01:30:29,967
Sir, we can't just desert Bond.

827
01:30:30,008 --> 01:30:32,052
We have to. We only make him weaker.

828
01:30:32,136 --> 01:30:33,762
But, sir, we know exactly where he is.

829
01:30:33,804 --> 01:30:36,432
Yes, I know, but if we can track him, so can others.

830
01:30:37,266 --> 01:30:39,601
Delete all the Smart Blood files.

831
01:30:39,643 --> 01:30:40,769
Everything.

832
01:30:42,688 --> 01:30:44,314
He's on his own.

833
01:31:10,674 --> 01:31:12,009
You shouldn't stare.

834
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:13,969
Well, you shouldn't look like that.

835
01:31:18,182 --> 01:31:19,933
May I get you an apéritif?

836
01:31:20,017 --> 01:31:21,351
I'm not sure.

837
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:24,521
It gets me into trouble. Makes me do crazy things.

838
01:31:24,563 --> 01:31:26,106
Well, we can't have that.

839
01:31:26,482 --> 01:31:29,985
So, I'll have a vodka martini, dirty.

840
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:31,820
Make that two.

841
01:31:35,365 --> 01:31:36,825
I have a question.

842
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:38,368
Well, what's that?

843
01:31:38,452 --> 01:31:41,330
Why, given every other possible option,

844
01:31:41,705 --> 01:31:44,208
does a man choose the life of a paid assassin?

845
01:31:44,249 --> 01:31:46,210
Well, it was that or the priesthood.

846
01:31:48,378 --> 01:31:51,548
I'm serious. Is this really what you want?

847
01:31:51,798 --> 01:31:55,469
Living in the shadows? Hunting? Being hunted?

848
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:59,181
Always looking behind you? Always alone?

849
01:31:59,556 --> 01:32:00,807
But I'm not alone.

850
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,268
Answer the question.

851
01:32:04,394 --> 01:32:06,855
I'm not sure I ever had a choice.

852
01:32:08,232 --> 01:32:10,317
Anyway, I don't stop to think about it.

853
01:32:10,609 --> 01:32:12,528
What would happen if you did?

854
01:32:13,362 --> 01:32:15,781
- Stop? - Yes.

855
01:32:19,785 --> 01:32:21,203
I don't know.

856
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:23,539
Your drinks, sir.

857
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:26,083
Could you leave them there, please.

858
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:39,763
You know, I think you're wrong.

859
01:32:39,805 --> 01:32:41,139
I am?

860
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:44,393
We always have a choice.

861
01:32:47,104 --> 01:32:48,814
I'll drink to that.

862
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:37,899
Shit.

863
01:35:46,324 --> 01:35:47,993
What do we do now?

864
01:36:47,427 --> 01:36:49,179
BOND: This might be a long wait.

865
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:53,975
Are you having second thoughts?

866
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:56,019
Too late now.

867
01:37:15,664 --> 01:37:17,040
What's that?

868
01:37:32,389 --> 01:37:37,060
That is a 1948 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith.

869
01:38:01,334 --> 01:38:02,377
Please.

870
01:38:25,442 --> 01:38:27,235
I'm scared, James.

871
01:39:11,071 --> 01:39:13,740
Good afternoon, Mr. Bond, Dr. Swann.

872
01:39:14,032 --> 01:39:17,827
I want you to know just how excited we all are to finally meet you.

873
01:39:17,911 --> 01:39:20,664
Well, it's a pleasure to be here.

874
01:39:20,914 --> 01:39:23,375
Your host invites you both to rest,

875
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:25,877
relax, and join him for drinks at 4:00.

876
01:39:26,252 --> 01:39:28,505
- Tell our host we won't be late. - MAN: Wonderful.

877
01:39:28,838 --> 01:39:31,591
Before we show you to your rooms, just one more thing.

878
01:39:39,349 --> 01:39:40,517
Oh.

879
01:39:43,269 --> 01:39:44,938
You be careful with that.

880
01:39:45,814 --> 01:39:47,315
It's loaded.

881
01:39:53,863 --> 01:39:55,198
Thank you.

882
01:40:54,382 --> 01:40:56,593
MAN: This is a very special place.

883
01:40:57,093 --> 01:41:00,430
He has requested you enter it alone.

884
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:02,265
Of course.

885
01:41:04,768 --> 01:41:06,102
Champagne?

886
01:41:07,437 --> 01:41:08,855
Maybe later.

887
01:41:09,564 --> 01:41:10,899
Certainly.

888
01:41:42,305 --> 01:41:44,849
BOND: I think we're meant to be impressed.

889
01:41:57,779 --> 01:41:59,030
OBERHAUSER: Touch it.

890
01:42:00,698 --> 01:42:02,909
You can touch it if you want.

891
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:06,955
Do you know what it is?

892
01:42:06,996 --> 01:42:08,665
It's a meteorite.

893
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:11,501
OBERHAUSER: Yes, exactly.

894
01:42:12,001 --> 01:42:15,797
The Kartenhoff. The oldest in human possession.

895
01:42:16,965 --> 01:42:19,801
The very meteorite which made this crater.

896
01:42:21,636 --> 01:42:22,846
Think about it.

897
01:42:23,513 --> 01:42:27,142
So many years up there, alone, silent,

898
01:42:28,309 --> 01:42:32,230
building momentum until it chose to make its mark on Earth.

899
01:42:34,023 --> 01:42:36,734
A huge, unstoppable force.

900
01:42:37,318 --> 01:42:39,654
Except it did stop, didn't it?

901
01:42:40,155 --> 01:42:41,531
Right here.

902
01:42:56,004 --> 01:42:59,883
I can't tell you how much I've been looking forward to this.

903
01:42:59,924 --> 01:43:02,218
All of us here, together.

904
01:43:05,013 --> 01:43:06,556
A reunion.

905
01:43:08,725 --> 01:43:11,561
I'm so glad you came, too, dear Madeleine.

906
01:43:13,354 --> 01:43:16,191
You were just a girl when I saw you first.

907
01:43:17,567 --> 01:43:20,528
I came to your home once to see your father.

908
01:43:23,072 --> 01:43:24,741
I don't remember that.

909
01:43:26,034 --> 01:43:27,410
But I do.

910
01:43:32,081 --> 01:43:33,291
Shall we?

911
01:43:37,253 --> 01:43:38,504
SWANN: What is this place?

912
01:43:39,255 --> 01:43:40,673
Information.

913
01:43:43,927 --> 01:43:45,678
Information is all,

914
01:43:46,971 --> 01:43:48,306
is it not?

915
01:43:49,557 --> 01:43:50,975
For example,

916
01:43:51,059 --> 01:43:55,647
you must know by now that the double-0 program is officially dead.

917
01:43:55,855 --> 01:44:00,109
Which leads me to speculate exactly why you came.

918
01:44:03,404 --> 01:44:06,282
So, James, why did you come?

919
01:44:06,783 --> 01:44:08,451
I came here to kill you.

920
01:44:09,452 --> 01:44:11,788
And I thought you came here to die.

921
01:44:12,121 --> 01:44:14,165
Well, it's all a matter of perspective.

922
01:44:15,792 --> 01:44:17,669
Speaking of perspective.

923
01:44:35,478 --> 01:44:38,815
- Is this live? - MAN: Live and direct. 16:20 GMT.

924
01:44:40,108 --> 01:44:42,360
OBERHAUSER: What an uncanny coincidence.

925
01:44:42,443 --> 01:44:46,906
The French have a saying, "It's the fate of glass to break."

926
01:44:46,990 --> 01:44:51,077
Well, maybe it's the fate of spies to just disappear.

927
01:44:51,286 --> 01:44:52,996
But with any luck,

928
01:44:53,329 --> 01:44:55,373
we leave something behind.

929
01:44:55,623 --> 01:44:59,127
In the meantime, I'm sure C will keep you all busy.

930
01:44:59,877 --> 01:45:01,504
Thank you all.

931
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:08,136
That's touching, don't you think?

932
01:45:11,306 --> 01:45:12,974
Well, James,

933
01:45:13,683 --> 01:45:15,977
it looks like you're all alone.

934
01:45:16,019 --> 01:45:18,646
Not much more than a voyeur, are you?

935
01:45:19,689 --> 01:45:21,691
Too scared to join in.

936
01:45:22,025 --> 01:45:23,609
I don't think you quite understand.

937
01:45:23,693 --> 01:45:25,153
Oh, I think I do.

938
01:45:25,194 --> 01:45:27,989
You set cities on fire and watch innocent people burn,

939
01:45:28,031 --> 01:45:30,241
so you can convince governments to join

940
01:45:30,325 --> 01:45:32,994
an intelligence network you've paid for.

941
01:45:33,036 --> 01:45:34,871
Not that complicated.

942
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:39,375
I'm guessing our little friend, C, he's one of your disciples.

943
01:45:40,835 --> 01:45:42,545
You could say that.

944
01:45:42,754 --> 01:45:44,339
And what does he get out of it?

945
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:46,549
Nothing.

946
01:45:47,175 --> 01:45:49,010
He's a visionary, like me.

947
01:45:49,052 --> 01:45:50,720
Visionaries.

948
01:45:51,512 --> 01:45:53,389
Psychiatric wards are full of them.

949
01:45:53,514 --> 01:45:56,434
Whereas you couldn't see what's right in front of you.

950
01:45:56,517 --> 01:46:00,521
You came across me so many times and yet you never saw me.

951
01:46:01,064 --> 01:46:03,524
Le Chiffre, Greene, Silva.

952
01:46:03,566 --> 01:46:04,734
All dead.

953
01:46:04,776 --> 01:46:05,902
Yeah, that's right.

954
01:46:06,194 --> 01:46:07,695
A nice pattern developed.

955
01:46:07,737 --> 01:46:11,199
You interfered in my world, I destroyed yours.

956
01:46:13,076 --> 01:46:14,660
Or did you think it was coincidence

957
01:46:14,744 --> 01:46:17,288
that all the women in your life ended up dead?

958
01:46:18,748 --> 01:46:20,833
Vesper Lynd, for example.

959
01:46:22,293 --> 01:46:25,713
She was the big one. Has he told you about her?

960
01:46:28,049 --> 01:46:31,219
And then, of course, your beloved M.

961
01:46:32,095 --> 01:46:34,097
Gone forever.

962
01:46:38,226 --> 01:46:39,394
Me.

963
01:46:41,270 --> 01:46:43,398
It was all me, James.

964
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:47,235
It's always been me. The author of all your pain.

965
01:46:51,072 --> 01:46:53,449
You're a brave woman, my dear.

966
01:47:00,790 --> 01:47:03,960
Now I understand why my father lost his mind.

967
01:47:04,293 --> 01:47:07,171
He didn't lose his mind, he was just weak.

968
01:47:07,255 --> 01:47:09,257
But at least he understood what he was up against.

969
01:47:09,632 --> 01:47:12,844
You see, they failed to comprehend the crucial fact,

970
01:47:12,927 --> 01:47:16,639
that a terrible event can lead to something wonderful.

971
01:47:18,975 --> 01:47:20,977
Since you mention your father, I'll show you.

972
01:47:21,978 --> 01:47:24,522
WHITE: She's clever. She's smarter than me.

973
01:47:24,605 --> 01:47:25,815
She knows how to hide.

974
01:47:28,151 --> 01:47:31,070
BOND: I can protect her if you tell me where he is.

975
01:47:33,448 --> 01:47:35,158
BOND: I can keep her alive.

976
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:36,409
WHITE: Yeah.

977
01:47:36,492 --> 01:47:37,702
BOND: You have my word.

978
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:39,745
No, no, no. Turn this off.

979
01:47:39,829 --> 01:47:41,414
WHITE: Your word?

980
01:47:41,998 --> 01:47:43,416
The word of an assassin!

981
01:47:43,499 --> 01:47:44,834
Turn this off.

982
01:47:45,001 --> 01:47:47,003
- This is important. - I said turn it off!

983
01:47:49,630 --> 01:47:52,133
I want you to understand something.

984
01:48:02,018 --> 01:48:03,686
BOND: That's my word.

985
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:06,105
Madeleine?

986
01:48:06,606 --> 01:48:08,024
Look at me.

987
01:48:09,192 --> 01:48:12,612
Don't look at him, Madeleine. Look at me.

988
01:48:14,489 --> 01:48:15,990
WHITE: L'Américain.

989
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:18,743
You save her,

990
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:22,205
she can lead you to L'Américain. She knows L'Américain.

991
01:48:24,999 --> 01:48:27,043
Try the Hoffler Klinik.

992
01:48:33,549 --> 01:48:37,887
You're a kite dancing in a hurricane, Mr. Bond.

993
01:48:41,057 --> 01:48:42,391
So long.

994
01:48:49,565 --> 01:48:52,902
The things that bring people together.

995
01:48:56,864 --> 01:48:59,492
Out of horror, beauty.

996
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:28,896
OBERHAUSER: Torture is easy, on a superficial level.

997
01:49:28,938 --> 01:49:32,066
A man can watch himself being disemboweled

998
01:49:32,567 --> 01:49:35,778
and derive great horror from the experience,

999
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:38,447
but it's still going on at a distance.

1000
01:49:38,614 --> 01:49:41,367
It isn't taking place where he is.

1001
01:49:42,118 --> 01:49:47,790
As you know all too well, dear Madeleine, a man lives inside his head.

1002
01:49:48,249 --> 01:49:51,043
That's where the seat of his soul is.

1003
01:49:52,378 --> 01:49:54,839
Now, James and I were both present recently

1004
01:49:54,922 --> 01:49:57,425
when a man was deprived of his eyes.

1005
01:49:58,426 --> 01:50:01,721
And the most astonishing thing happened.

1006
01:50:01,804 --> 01:50:02,930
Didn't you notice?

1007
01:50:03,472 --> 01:50:05,641
He wasn't there anymore.

1008
01:50:05,975 --> 01:50:08,352
He'd gone even though he was still alive.

1009
01:50:08,436 --> 01:50:12,315
So in this brief moment between life and death,

1010
01:50:12,398 --> 01:50:15,234
there was nobody inside his skull.

1011
01:50:16,777 --> 01:50:18,112
Most odd.

1012
01:50:20,031 --> 01:50:21,407
So, James.

1013
01:50:23,326 --> 01:50:26,162
I'm going to penetrate

1014
01:50:26,954 --> 01:50:29,332
to where you are.

1015
01:50:30,124 --> 01:50:32,335
To the inside of your head.

1016
01:50:33,419 --> 01:50:36,172
Now, the first probe will play with your sight,

1017
01:50:36,547 --> 01:50:37,673
your hearing

1018
01:50:38,299 --> 01:50:40,468
and your balance,

1019
01:50:40,509 --> 01:50:43,346
just with the subtlest of manipulations.

1020
01:50:43,512 --> 01:50:45,556
Well, get on with it then.

1021
01:50:46,182 --> 01:50:49,518
Nothing can be as painful as listening to you talk.

1022
01:50:50,311 --> 01:50:51,646
All right.

1023
01:50:52,438 --> 01:50:53,856
Let's begin.

1024
01:51:26,514 --> 01:51:28,516
Why are you doing this?

1025
01:51:41,696 --> 01:51:43,864
You probably know that James here

1026
01:51:43,906 --> 01:51:46,033
lost his parents when he was young.

1027
01:51:49,370 --> 01:51:51,831
But did you know that it was my father

1028
01:51:51,914 --> 01:51:54,291
who helped him through this difficult time?

1029
01:52:02,466 --> 01:52:04,468
Over the course of two winters

1030
01:52:04,552 --> 01:52:08,764
he taught him to ski, and climb, and hunt.

1031
01:52:09,557 --> 01:52:13,936
He soothed the wounds of the poor little blue-eyed orphan.

1032
01:52:16,605 --> 01:52:19,275
Asked me to treat him as a brother.

1033
01:52:19,775 --> 01:52:21,527
My little brother.

1034
01:52:23,112 --> 01:52:25,114
They formed quite an attachment.

1035
01:52:26,782 --> 01:52:27,908
So,

1036
01:52:28,743 --> 01:52:29,952
you killed him.

1037
01:52:31,454 --> 01:52:32,955
Yes, I did.

1038
01:52:36,459 --> 01:52:39,128
You know what happens when a cuckoo

1039
01:52:39,211 --> 01:52:42,131
hatches inside another bird's nest?

1040
01:52:43,424 --> 01:52:44,592
Yes.

1041
01:52:45,634 --> 01:52:48,095
It forces the other eggs out.

1042
01:52:48,137 --> 01:52:49,180
OBERHAUSER: Yes.

1043
01:52:49,472 --> 01:52:54,477
Well, this cuckoo made me realize my father's life had to end.

1044
01:52:55,811 --> 01:52:58,397
In a way, he's responsible for the path I took.

1045
01:52:58,647 --> 01:53:01,317
So, thank you. Cuckoo.

1046
01:53:07,156 --> 01:53:10,075
Do you know any other birdcalls, Franz?

1047
01:53:17,625 --> 01:53:18,959
Hello, pussy.

1048
01:53:21,670 --> 01:53:25,299
Franz Oberhauser died 20 years ago, James.

1049
01:53:25,341 --> 01:53:28,093
In an avalanche, alongside his father.

1050
01:53:29,345 --> 01:53:33,766
The man you are talking to now, the man inside your head,

1051
01:53:34,517 --> 01:53:37,102
is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

1052
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:38,979
Catchy name.

1053
01:53:39,522 --> 01:53:41,524
My mother's bloodline.

1054
01:53:42,983 --> 01:53:47,196
If the needle finds the correct spot in the fusiform gyrus,

1055
01:53:47,696 --> 01:53:49,698
you'll recognize no one.

1056
01:53:49,949 --> 01:53:51,575
Of course, the faces of your women

1057
01:53:51,659 --> 01:53:53,536
are interchangeable, aren't they, James?

1058
01:53:55,704 --> 01:53:57,331
You won't know who she is.

1059
01:53:57,373 --> 01:54:00,626
Just another passing face on your way to the grave.

1060
01:54:09,343 --> 01:54:12,054
He dies not knowing who you are.

1061
01:54:14,348 --> 01:54:16,225
The daughter of an assassin.

1062
01:54:16,851 --> 01:54:18,853
The only one who could have understood him.

1063
01:54:20,020 --> 01:54:21,397
- Shame. -

1064
01:54:32,783 --> 01:54:34,827
- -

1065
01:54:58,309 --> 01:54:59,768
I love you.

1066
01:55:05,065 --> 01:55:07,526
BLOFELD: Do those blue eyes still recognize you?

1067
01:55:11,947 --> 01:55:14,742
I'd recognize you anywhere.

1068
01:55:16,994 --> 01:55:18,329
The watch.

1069
01:55:33,802 --> 01:55:35,179
One minute.

1070
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:38,098
One minute.

1071
01:55:42,144 --> 01:55:43,938
BLOFELD: Did he say something?

1072
01:55:43,979 --> 01:55:45,314
Tempus fugit.

1073
01:55:47,149 --> 01:55:49,818
- What? - Tempus fugit.

1074
01:55:50,319 --> 01:55:52,321
I can't hear you, James.

1075
01:55:54,698 --> 01:55:56,033
BOND: I said,

1076
01:55:56,825 --> 01:55:58,661
doesn't time fly?

1077
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:27,314
In there!

1078
01:57:08,897 --> 01:57:10,399
Let's go home.

1079
01:57:26,582 --> 01:57:28,250
It's not over yet.

1080
01:58:18,092 --> 01:58:19,676
Q: I've never even heard of Hildebrand.

1081
01:58:19,760 --> 01:58:22,971
M: That is the general idea with safe houses.

1082
01:58:39,947 --> 01:58:41,573
Exactly how safe is this, sir?

1083
01:58:41,657 --> 01:58:43,492
We're about to find out.

1084
01:58:46,954 --> 01:58:48,455
It's safe.

1085
01:58:48,497 --> 01:58:50,165
Better wait here.

1086
01:58:53,627 --> 01:58:54,795
I'm M.

1087
01:58:54,837 --> 01:58:55,879
Madeleine Swann.

1088
01:58:55,963 --> 01:58:56,964
Pleased to meet you.

1089
01:58:57,005 --> 01:58:58,841
So, what do you have for me, 007?

1090
01:58:58,924 --> 01:59:02,970
The recently deceased head of Spectre, Ernst Stavro Blofeld,

1091
01:59:03,637 --> 01:59:07,474
and his chief of intelligence, your new best friend, C.

1092
01:59:08,851 --> 01:59:11,854
About to take control of his very own global surveillance system

1093
01:59:11,937 --> 01:59:14,481
that he built right here under our noses.

1094
01:59:14,523 --> 01:59:16,942
Then we'd better move. The system goes online at midnight.

1095
01:59:17,359 --> 01:59:20,237
BOND: If that happens, Spectre will have control of everything.

1096
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:22,281
So, you and I will have a quiet word with C

1097
01:59:22,364 --> 01:59:25,033
while Q hacks into the system and stops it going online.

1098
01:59:25,659 --> 01:59:26,702
It won't be easy.

1099
01:59:26,743 --> 01:59:29,163
He'll find a way. He always does.

1100
01:59:33,959 --> 01:59:35,836
It's good to have you back, 007.

1101
01:59:36,712 --> 01:59:37,796
Sir.

1102
01:59:47,389 --> 01:59:49,224
James, I can't.

1103
01:59:49,975 --> 01:59:52,895
I'll come back for you when it's all over.

1104
01:59:53,896 --> 01:59:55,480
No, I can't.

1105
01:59:55,898 --> 01:59:57,900
No, you can't stay here, or you...

1106
01:59:58,567 --> 02:00:02,779
I can't go back to this life. And I'm not going to ask you to change.

1107
02:00:03,488 --> 02:00:04,990
This is who you are.

1108
02:00:07,743 --> 02:00:09,286
You're saying good-bye.

1109
02:00:10,078 --> 02:00:11,205
Yes.

1110
02:00:13,373 --> 02:00:14,708
Take care.

1111
02:00:17,127 --> 02:00:19,129
You're a good man, James.

1112
02:01:20,315 --> 02:01:21,858
Are you in yet, Q?

1113
02:01:22,317 --> 02:01:24,653
A few layers of impenetrable security still to go,

1114
02:01:24,695 --> 02:01:26,655
but I think I'm getting somewhere.

1115
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:16,663
They've seen us! Reverse!

1116
02:02:56,578 --> 02:02:57,746
Go!

1117
02:03:08,799 --> 02:03:10,759
Get him in the building!

1118
02:03:10,884 --> 02:03:13,053
Move. Move!

1119
02:04:32,007 --> 02:04:35,552
Go back and find M, now! We need them both.

1120
02:04:45,020 --> 02:04:47,856
Not a good feeling being watched, is it?

1121
02:04:52,527 --> 02:04:54,446
Don't tell me you're responsible for this.

1122
02:04:54,529 --> 02:04:57,407
No, but my Quartermaster is.

1123
02:04:57,491 --> 02:04:59,242
And he's extremely talented.

1124
02:04:59,326 --> 02:05:00,368
C: Well, bravo.

1125
02:05:00,452 --> 02:05:04,873
But in case you hadn't realized it, you two are out of a job.

1126
02:05:04,956 --> 02:05:06,208
So you're trespassing.

1127
02:05:06,249 --> 02:05:08,710
I'm afraid you've got the wrong end of the stick, Max.

1128
02:05:08,793 --> 02:05:11,546
We're going to stop this system going online.

1129
02:05:11,630 --> 02:05:13,006
And then I'm going to bring you in.

1130
02:05:13,131 --> 02:05:14,674
On what grounds exactly?

1131
02:05:14,966 --> 02:05:16,885
Poor taste in friends.

1132
02:05:53,213 --> 02:05:55,632
Take a look at the world.

1133
02:05:57,217 --> 02:05:58,385
Chaos.

1134
02:05:59,511 --> 02:06:01,429
Because people like you,

1135
02:06:01,513 --> 02:06:02,931
paper-pushers and politicians,

1136
02:06:03,056 --> 02:06:06,601
are too spineless to do what needs to be done.

1137
02:06:07,060 --> 02:06:10,564
So I made an alliance to put the power where it should be.

1138
02:06:10,605 --> 02:06:15,610
And now you want to throw it away for the sake of "democracy."

1139
02:06:16,236 --> 02:06:17,904
Whatever the hell that is.

1140
02:06:18,446 --> 02:06:21,074
How predictably moronic.

1141
02:06:21,116 --> 02:06:24,452
But then isn't that what M stands for?

1142
02:06:26,288 --> 02:06:28,248
- "Moron." -

1143
02:06:29,332 --> 02:06:31,668
And now we know what C stands for.

1144
02:06:36,298 --> 02:06:37,632
"Careless."

1145
02:07:16,921 --> 02:07:18,548
Come on.

1146
02:07:18,673 --> 02:07:20,425
- - No, no, no!

1147
02:08:24,698 --> 02:08:27,992
You're a hard man to kill, Blofeld.

1148
02:08:34,416 --> 02:08:36,584
Ouch.

1149
02:08:37,168 --> 02:08:38,920
I do hope that doesn't hurt too much.

1150
02:08:40,213 --> 02:08:43,717
My wounds will heal.

1151
02:08:43,758 --> 02:08:45,385
What about yours?

1152
02:08:46,928 --> 02:08:49,264
Look around you, James. Look.

1153
02:08:49,723 --> 02:08:51,891
This is what's left of your world.

1154
02:08:52,183 --> 02:08:56,396
Everything you ever stood for, everything you believed in, a ruin.

1155
02:08:57,564 --> 02:09:00,066
Why are we here?

1156
02:09:01,317 --> 02:09:03,069
Did you miss me?

1157
02:09:03,945 --> 02:09:05,238
No.

1158
02:09:11,870 --> 02:09:14,956
But I know someone who does.

1159
02:09:22,130 --> 02:09:24,215
Where is she?

1160
02:09:25,008 --> 02:09:27,469
That's for you to find out.

1161
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:37,979
In three minutes, this building will be demolished.

1162
02:09:39,063 --> 02:09:41,316
I can get out easily.

1163
02:09:41,399 --> 02:09:43,485
Now, you have a choice.

1164
02:09:43,526 --> 02:09:46,112
Die trying to save her or

1165
02:09:46,154 --> 02:09:48,531
save yourself and live with the pain.

1166
02:09:49,699 --> 02:09:50,825
You're bluffing.

1167
02:09:53,411 --> 02:09:54,496
Am I?

1168
02:10:02,170 --> 02:10:04,047
I've really put you through it, haven't I?

1169
02:10:05,799 --> 02:10:07,342
That's brothers for you.

1170
02:10:08,343 --> 02:10:11,805
They always know which buttons to press.

1171
02:10:24,192 --> 02:10:26,236
Madeleine!

1172
02:10:31,491 --> 02:10:33,243
- Come on. -

1173
02:10:33,618 --> 02:10:34,619
Come on.

1174
02:10:36,162 --> 02:10:37,622
Yes!

1175
02:10:39,249 --> 02:10:40,625
Let's go.

1176
02:10:41,334 --> 02:10:42,335
After you.

1177
02:10:52,762 --> 02:10:56,015
Why can't you just face it, M?

1178
02:10:57,100 --> 02:10:58,560
You don't matter anymore.

1179
02:10:59,394 --> 02:11:01,479
Maybe I don't.

1180
02:11:01,563 --> 02:11:02,730
But something has to.

1181
02:11:57,702 --> 02:11:58,703
Dead.

1182
02:11:58,912 --> 02:12:00,288
- Any word on Bond? - MONEYPENNY: No.

1183
02:12:00,455 --> 02:12:02,290
But I can hazard a guess.

1184
02:12:10,048 --> 02:12:12,133
Madeleine!

1185
02:12:14,344 --> 02:12:16,387
Madeleine!

1186
02:13:01,182 --> 02:13:02,308
Do you trust me?

1187
02:13:02,684 --> 02:13:03,768
Do I have a choice?

1188
02:13:03,851 --> 02:13:04,852
Not anymore.

1189
02:13:15,697 --> 02:13:17,031
Come on!

1190
02:13:32,046 --> 02:13:33,965
Good-bye, James Bond.

1191
02:15:36,671 --> 02:15:38,214
Brace, brace, brace!

1192
02:16:46,073 --> 02:16:47,366
Sir, this is a terrorist alert.

1193
02:16:47,408 --> 02:16:48,576
Mallory, double-0 section.

1194
02:16:51,871 --> 02:16:53,831
Stand them down.

1195
02:16:55,249 --> 02:16:56,751
Echo team, hold fire.

1196
02:16:57,084 --> 02:16:59,337
Stand down.

1197
02:17:34,830 --> 02:17:35,957
Finish it.

1198
02:17:47,510 --> 02:17:49,220
Finish it.

1199
02:18:01,774 --> 02:18:03,234
Out of bullets.

1200
02:18:20,126 --> 02:18:22,169
And besides,

1201
02:18:22,503 --> 02:18:24,505
I've got something better to do.

1202
02:19:10,968 --> 02:19:13,179
Under the Special Measures Act of 2001,

1203
02:19:13,220 --> 02:19:16,140
I am detaining you on behalf of Her Majesty's Government.

1204
02:20:22,248 --> 02:20:23,541
Bond?

1205
02:20:28,629 --> 02:20:30,631
- What are you doing here? - Good morning, Q.

1206
02:20:38,514 --> 02:20:39,723
I thought you'd gone.

1207
02:20:39,807 --> 02:20:40,933
I have.

1208
02:20:42,810 --> 02:20:45,062
There's just one thing I need.
