1
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,039
Dr. Cotter.

2
00:02:08,123 --> 00:02:10,351
He's gonna die. She's gonna die.
Mom's gonna die.

3
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,015
I'm gonna die. Everybody dies.

4
00:02:12,085 --> 00:02:14,202
I don't wanna... I'm gonna...

5
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:17,734
I haven't been able to get him to talk...

6
00:02:17,758 --> 00:02:19,090
respond to me, nothing.

7
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:22,127
Just this.

8
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,212
Yeah. I got it.

9
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:26,223
Thanks, Dan.

10
00:02:26,308 --> 00:02:29,495
She's gonna die. Mom's gonna die.
I'm gonna die. Everyone dies.

11
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,513
Nobody matters. She doesn't matter.
He doesn't matter. Mom doesn't matter.

12
00:02:33,607 --> 00:02:36,645
I don't matter.
Nothing ever matters. I don't matter.

13
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:39,603
I don't matter.
He's gonna die. She's gonna die.

14
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:42,154
He's gonna die. I'm gonna die.
Everyone dies.

15
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,136
Nobody matters. She doesn't matter.
He doesn't matter.

16
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,430
Everyone dies. I'm gonna die.
Nobody matters.

17
00:02:47,454 --> 00:02:49,531
She doesn't matter. He doesn't matter.

18
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:52,560
Mom doesn't matter.
Nothing ever matters. I don't matter.

19
00:02:52,584 --> 00:02:55,668
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

20
00:02:55,754 --> 00:02:58,713
She's gonna... She's gonna...
Everyone... I'm gonna...

21
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:01,040
I don't matter. I'm gonna... I'm gonna...

22
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,006
Hi, Carl.

23
00:03:10,227 --> 00:03:11,684
What's going on today?

24
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:15,354
I'm dying.

25
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,476
No.

26
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:19,020
I don't think so.

27
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:24,133
I think you're having
another manic episode.

28
00:03:24,157 --> 00:03:25,193
Don't...

29
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:27,237
Don't you tell me.

30
00:03:27,994 --> 00:03:29,701
You don't know.

31
00:03:29,788 --> 00:03:33,623
I feel it all around me, squeezing.

32
00:03:38,255 --> 00:03:39,791
I'm scared.

33
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:45,627
Carl, I know that
what you're experiencing feels real,

34
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:47,758
but it can't hurt you.

35
00:03:52,352 --> 00:03:53,684
I promise.

36
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,889
He's gonna die. She's gonna die.
Mom's gonna die. I'm gonna die.

37
00:03:57,983 --> 00:04:00,461
Everyone dies.
Nobody matters. She doesn't matter.

38
00:04:00,485 --> 00:04:01,601
Hey, Wanda.

39
00:04:01,695 --> 00:04:05,258
I'm gonna put Carl Renken into observation
for a few days. He's harmless.

40
00:04:05,282 --> 00:04:07,802
Just make sure someone checks on him
every couple hours.

41
00:04:07,826 --> 00:04:09,362
- You got it.
- Thanks.

42
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:11,615
Hey, Dr. Desai was looking for you.

43
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:13,789
Thank you.

44
00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:28,006
No! No! Please!

45
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:31,055
Please! You don't understand!
I can't go in there! No!

46
00:04:31,141 --> 00:04:34,430
No! No! Please!

47
00:04:35,061 --> 00:04:36,302
No!

48
00:04:37,314 --> 00:04:38,725
No!

49
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:56,788
Come in.

50
00:04:58,418 --> 00:05:02,002
Hey, did you send a patient named, uh,

51
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:04,671
Sarah Marquet over to residency yesterday?

52
00:05:04,758 --> 00:05:07,671
Yes. She has a history
with drug abuse and mania,

53
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:09,697
and she's been in and out of our unit
a few times.

54
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:11,963
Rose, she has no insurance.

55
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:13,659
Okay, but she needs treatment.

56
00:05:13,683 --> 00:05:15,828
The board is down my throat
about paying out of pocket

57
00:05:15,852 --> 00:05:17,580
for another bed in the residency program.

58
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:22,144
The board should try giving a shit about
the point of our job here once in a while.

59
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,797
I'm not questioning your judgment.

60
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:28,382
I just need you to come to me first
so I can get ahead of it next time.

61
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:29,613
- All right?
- Yes.

62
00:05:30,325 --> 00:05:32,032
Okay. I'm sorry.

63
00:05:32,118 --> 00:05:35,834
Hey, you haven't been here
since the late shift last night, have you?

64
00:06:10,198 --> 00:06:11,198
Dr. Cotter.

65
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:14,095
Laura Weaver, 26. She's a grad student.

66
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:16,264
Police were called on her
for public disturbance.

67
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:18,307
- EMS brought her in.
- Got any psych history?

68
00:06:18,331 --> 00:06:20,351
Nothing on file,
but the police sent over a report

69
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,728
for a different incident
she was involved in last week.

70
00:06:22,752 --> 00:06:24,618
And what was that one about?

71
00:06:24,713 --> 00:06:27,859
A professor at her school
bludgeoned himself to death with a hammer.

72
00:06:27,883 --> 00:06:30,069
She was interviewed as the only witness.

73
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:31,421
A hammer?

74
00:06:41,563 --> 00:06:42,679
Hi.

75
00:06:43,398 --> 00:06:44,514
Laura?

76
00:06:47,944 --> 00:06:51,278
My name is Dr. Cotter. I'm a therapist.

77
00:06:51,364 --> 00:06:52,696
Do you wanna sit down?

78
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,072
Okay.

79
00:06:59,247 --> 00:07:00,613
I know you're nervous.

80
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,166
That's okay.

81
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:05,534
I just wanna have a chat.

82
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,746
I promise this is a safe place.

83
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:10,293
Not for me.

84
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,546
Why do you say that?

85
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:21,259
Come on. Let's sit.

86
00:07:29,986 --> 00:07:30,986
Please.

87
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:50,205
Okay. I'm gonna ask you
a couple of questions

88
00:07:50,298 --> 00:07:51,755
that might sound stupid.

89
00:07:55,178 --> 00:07:57,170
What day of the week is it?

90
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,139
Thursday.

91
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:01,386
And the month?

92
00:08:01,476 --> 00:08:02,967
October. I'm not crazy.

93
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:05,790
- Nobody's saying that.
- But I need you to understand.

94
00:08:05,814 --> 00:08:08,773
I'm a PhD candidate.
I'm not some lunatic. Okay?

95
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:13,728
Let's just take a breath,
and you can just tell me what's going on.

96
00:08:24,082 --> 00:08:25,698
I'm seeing something.

97
00:08:27,585 --> 00:08:30,373
Something no one else can see
except for me.

98
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:34,878
I know how insane that sounds. I do.

99
00:08:34,968 --> 00:08:38,302
But it's... This thing, I can't explain it.

100
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:41,300
What is it you're seeing?

101
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,342
It looks like people,

102
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:46,076
but it's... it's not a person.

103
00:08:47,522 --> 00:08:49,229
I'm not sure I understand.

104
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:51,669
It looks like people.
It looks like different people.

105
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:54,310
Sometimes it pretends
to be someone that I know.

106
00:08:54,404 --> 00:08:57,067
Sometimes it's a random stranger.
Sometimes...

107
00:08:57,157 --> 00:08:59,740
Sometimes it looks like my grandfather

108
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:02,159
who died in front of me when I was seven.

109
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:07,076
But it's all the same thing. It...

110
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:11,414
It's... It's like...

111
00:09:13,506 --> 00:09:17,090
It's... It's like it wears people's faces
like... like masks.

112
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,961
Okay.

113
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:22,092
Do you see it right now, here?

114
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:28,060
What happens when you do see it?

115
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:33,474
It's smiling at me.

116
00:09:34,986 --> 00:09:36,353
But not a friendly smile.

117
00:09:36,446 --> 00:09:38,507
It's the worst smile
I've ever seen in my life.

118
00:09:38,531 --> 00:09:41,945
And whenever I see it,
I just get this god-awful feeling

119
00:09:42,035 --> 00:09:45,153
like something really terrible
is gonna happen.

120
00:09:46,331 --> 00:09:49,074
I've never felt scared
like I do when I see it.

121
00:09:50,877 --> 00:09:53,540
Laura, have you
or anyone else in your family

122
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,963
ever experienced hallucinations?

123
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:57,985
It's not a hallucination, no. It's real.

124
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:00,071
You don't get it. It does things to me.

125
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:02,132
It causes shit to happen around me.

126
00:10:02,222 --> 00:10:05,806
It's taken over my whole life
and my mind and...

127
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:08,809
it tells me things.

128
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:13,472
It told me that to... today... Today's the...

129
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:16,980
Today's the day that I'm... I'm gonna...

130
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,652
Okay. That's okay.

131
00:10:18,738 --> 00:10:19,819
That's okay.

132
00:10:21,783 --> 00:10:26,778
I know that what you're experiencing
feels incredibly real.

133
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:29,739
Sometimes, when we get
emotionally overwhelmed,

134
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:33,417
or experience an intense trauma,
our minds tend to...

135
00:10:33,503 --> 00:10:34,979
You're not listening to me.

136
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:36,666
Oh, my God.

137
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:41,255
I'm gonna fucking die,
and no one will listen to me.

138
00:10:41,344 --> 00:10:42,755
Okay. Laura, it's okay.

139
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:45,178
Oh, God.

140
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,927
Hey, it's okay. Laura.

141
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:50,054
Hey, c-can you look at me, please?

142
00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:52,604
It's okay.

143
00:10:53,857 --> 00:10:54,857
Look at me.

144
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,110
I...

145
00:11:01,781 --> 00:11:03,773
Oh, my God. No!

146
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:05,153
No! It's here!

147
00:11:05,243 --> 00:11:06,637
- Please!
- Laura. It's okay.

148
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:07,847
- It's just us.
- Get away! Please!

149
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:09,620
- There's nobody else here.
- No!

150
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,165
No!

151
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:21,124
Oh, my God.

152
00:11:23,845 --> 00:11:27,839
I... I have a patient emergency in eval 2.
I need staff here now.

153
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:28,932
Hurry.

154
00:11:49,954 --> 00:11:50,990
Laura?

155
00:14:07,508 --> 00:14:09,737
Had Ms. Weaver
ever been a patient here before?

156
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:10,761
No.

157
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:13,907
Would you say she was typical
of the patients you see here?

158
00:14:13,931 --> 00:14:16,969
This is an emergency psychiatric unit.

159
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:20,102
Typical is not really a thing here.

160
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:22,225
Right. But she was a head case, yeah?

161
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:24,398
I'm sorry, a head case?

162
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:32,485
I think we're just trying to get
your opinion of her mental state.

163
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:39,247
She could've been suffering from...
acute post-trauma psychosis.

164
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:44,417
She was having paranoid delusions.

165
00:14:44,504 --> 00:14:46,245
What kind of delusions?

166
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:52,336
She was convinced that some...
sort of evil presence was haunting her.

167
00:14:53,346 --> 00:14:54,462
Yikes.

168
00:14:56,724 --> 00:14:59,244
It's just, we're gonna have to contact
Ms. Weaver's family

169
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:01,288
and attempt to explain what happened.

170
00:15:01,312 --> 00:15:05,226
So we're looking for anything
that might make some sense of all this.

171
00:15:05,316 --> 00:15:09,185
If there's anything else you can tell us,
that... that might help.

172
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:22,411
Uh, before she died...

173
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:27,999
she was... smiling.

174
00:15:28,965 --> 00:15:31,582
Yeah, she sounds fucking crazy to me.

175
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,035
Rose.

176
00:18:17,675 --> 00:18:20,088
My bad. Did I scare you?

177
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:21,926
I didn't hear you come in. Shit.

178
00:18:22,597 --> 00:18:23,758
- Hi.
- Hi.

179
00:18:23,848 --> 00:18:24,848
Hi.

180
00:18:26,684 --> 00:18:27,765
What's up?

181
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:30,139
Nothing. Sorry.

182
00:18:31,689 --> 00:18:32,850
Something's wrong.

183
00:18:36,402 --> 00:18:38,143
A patient died today.

184
00:18:38,237 --> 00:18:39,773
My patient.

185
00:18:41,365 --> 00:18:42,822
Hey, come here.

186
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:45,116
I'm sorry.

187
00:18:46,537 --> 00:18:48,403
It happened right in front of me.

188
00:18:49,123 --> 00:18:50,364
It was awful.

189
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:53,492
I'm so sorry. What can I do?

190
00:18:57,506 --> 00:18:59,042
This is a nice start.

191
00:19:03,763 --> 00:19:07,723
Maybe we should bail on dinner tonight.

192
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:12,685
We can't.

193
00:19:13,648 --> 00:19:16,356
Holly hired a sitter,

194
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:19,379
and it's just gonna be a bigger headache
if we don't go.

195
00:19:19,403 --> 00:19:21,520
No way. Holly turning into a headache?

196
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:25,075
Hey.

197
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:38,774
I'm sorry,
you wanna talk about being tired?

198
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:43,088
Now that Jackson's in the first grade,
I'm literally up at 6:00 a.m. every day

199
00:19:43,177 --> 00:19:45,464
to make him breakfast and pack him lunch.

200
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:49,326
God knows what kind of nonorganic garbage
that cafeteria is even serving.

201
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,869
Then I have to drive him to school,

202
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:52,996
barely have any time
to run my own errands.

203
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,623
Like, I haven't been to Pilates in weeks.

204
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:56,416
- Okay, my body is so fucked.
- Not true.

205
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,293
I have to go back to school, pick him up,

206
00:19:58,317 --> 00:20:00,337
then I have to take him
to either soccer practice,

207
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:02,089
swim lessons, karate, theater...

208
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:04,132
Oh, and he just started taking Spanish.

209
00:20:04,156 --> 00:20:07,274
I mean, my weekdays
are literally impossible.

210
00:20:09,495 --> 00:20:11,737
Mmm. You are coming Saturday, right?

211
00:20:12,915 --> 00:20:13,996
What?

212
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:17,079
Uh, sorry, what's Saturday?

213
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:19,035
- I'm sorry, is that a joke?
- Wow.

214
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,400
- Rose, Jackson's seventh birthday party.
- Wow.

215
00:20:21,424 --> 00:20:23,256
I've told you, like, five times.

216
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:24,628
I can't. I have work.

217
00:20:25,678 --> 00:20:27,572
What do you mean work? It's Saturday.

218
00:20:27,596 --> 00:20:28,596
I work Saturday.

219
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:31,743
See, this is exactly why you have to
get out of that gross hospital

220
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:33,787
- and into a private practice...
- Gross?

221
00:20:33,811 --> 00:20:35,997
- It is not gross.
- ...working normal-people hours.

222
00:20:36,021 --> 00:20:38,809
Rose, there have to be
plenty of crazies out there

223
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:40,711
who will actually pay you for your time.

224
00:20:40,735 --> 00:20:43,227
Thank you so much for your input, Greg.

225
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
That's very sweet.

226
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:46,373
I'm just saying, why become a doctor

227
00:20:46,407 --> 00:20:48,444
if you can't get disgustingly rich?

228
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:49,737
You're kidding, right?

229
00:20:50,786 --> 00:20:52,764
Rose loves being a doctor.
She'd do it for free.

230
00:20:52,788 --> 00:20:54,745
What...

231
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,979
Well, on the subject
of wasted earning potentials,

232
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:01,606
- we could always sell the fucking house.
- Can we not right now?

233
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,650
I don't understand you.
It's just sitting there.

234
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:05,506
We grew up in that house.

235
00:21:05,593 --> 00:21:08,530
Rose, it's a total teardown.
Why not just get the money for the land?

236
00:21:08,554 --> 00:21:10,467
Can you guys just shut the fuck up?

237
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,801
Thank you.

238
00:21:15,895 --> 00:21:17,371
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

239
00:21:19,398 --> 00:21:21,256
I've been looking forward to this.

240
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,350
You okay?

241
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:56,935
Yeah.

242
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:15,990
Morning, Doc.

243
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,407
Morning.

244
00:22:29,635 --> 00:22:32,594
Hey. Yesterday,
that patient, Laura Weaver...

245
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,200
The police had sent a report
about a different incident

246
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:36,591
that she was involved in.

247
00:22:36,642 --> 00:22:39,371
- Can you get that forwarded to me?
- You got it, Doc.

248
00:22:39,395 --> 00:22:42,082
Also, I was supposed to have
a session with Jane Park.

249
00:22:42,106 --> 00:22:44,584
Oh, yeah. She pulled out
a bunch of her hair overnight

250
00:22:44,608 --> 00:22:45,940
and swallowed it all.

251
00:22:46,026 --> 00:22:48,588
They took her down to medicine
to have her stomach pumped.

252
00:22:48,612 --> 00:22:50,729
Shit.

253
00:22:51,532 --> 00:22:53,068
Uh, Rose.

254
00:22:56,704 --> 00:22:59,766
- What... What are you...
- I was on a... I was on a call nearby,

255
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,375
and I just thought I would...

256
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,672
We didn't really get to talk yesterday,
other than the whole... whole thing.

257
00:23:08,757 --> 00:23:11,778
And I just wanted you to know
that when the call came in,

258
00:23:11,802 --> 00:23:14,215
I had no idea it was gonna be you.

259
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:15,991
So, I'm sorry if that was weird.

260
00:23:16,015 --> 00:23:17,802
It's your job. I get it.

261
00:23:19,518 --> 00:23:20,679
How you been?

262
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:22,726
Joel, why are you here?

263
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:26,543
Like I said,
I was on a call nearby, and I just...

264
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:27,978
I thought I would...

265
00:23:29,445 --> 00:23:32,153
come check on you.

266
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:35,886
After everything that happened yesterday,
that's... that's not an easy thing.

267
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,244
Okay. I appreciate it,
but I don't need you to check on me.

268
00:23:43,834 --> 00:23:45,450
Right.

269
00:23:45,544 --> 00:23:48,252
No, yeah, I mean... Sorry.

270
00:23:49,757 --> 00:23:51,248
I have to get back to work.

271
00:23:51,842 --> 00:23:53,799
- Yeah.
- See you around.

272
00:24:01,018 --> 00:24:02,822
You do know she's engaged, right?

273
00:24:05,105 --> 00:24:06,516
Yeah.

274
00:24:08,692 --> 00:24:10,228
I'm single.

275
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,096
- Hello.
- Hi.

276
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,877
Um, look, I just wanted to say sorry
about last night, okay?

277
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:53,894
I shouldn't have
kept going at you like that.

278
00:24:53,988 --> 00:24:55,354
Uh, no, I...

279
00:24:56,073 --> 00:24:57,655
I should apologize.

280
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:00,791
I've been just dealing with some stuff.

281
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:03,452
I wasn't being very good company.

282
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:06,226
Okay. If you can't make it to
your nephew's party tomorrow,

283
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,583
you could at least get him a present.

284
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:11,894
if you need an idea,
he's really into electric model trains.

285
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:15,836
You sound weird. Are you okay?

286
00:25:15,926 --> 00:25:17,963
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

287
00:25:43,704 --> 00:25:44,990
Hey, Carl.

288
00:25:46,749 --> 00:25:48,581
How you feeling today?

289
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:00,460
Carl.

290
00:26:05,851 --> 00:26:06,967
Carl?

291
00:26:13,067 --> 00:26:15,605
She's gonna die. I'm gonna die.

292
00:26:15,694 --> 00:26:17,505
- Everybody dies.
- Carl, look at me.

293
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:19,361
You're going to die.

294
00:26:19,448 --> 00:26:21,064
You're going to die.

295
00:26:21,158 --> 00:26:22,820
You're going to die.

296
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,369
You're going to die. You're going to die.

297
00:26:26,455 --> 00:26:29,619
You're going to die. You're going to die.

298
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:31,370
- You're going to die.
- Help!

299
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,668
Help! This patient is 5150!

300
00:26:33,754 --> 00:26:35,995
- He needs to be restrained!
- Go, go, go!

301
00:26:37,091 --> 00:26:38,832
No! No!

302
00:26:38,926 --> 00:26:40,133
No!

303
00:26:40,719 --> 00:26:44,679
No! No! No! No!

304
00:26:44,765 --> 00:26:46,802
No! No!

305
00:26:46,892 --> 00:26:49,475
No! No!

306
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:51,803
No!

307
00:27:02,366 --> 00:27:03,982
He was aggressive.

308
00:27:04,618 --> 00:27:06,985
Acting psychotic.

309
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:09,766
Carl Renken has been
in and out of here a dozen times

310
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,999
and has never exhibited behavior
even remotely aggressive.

311
00:27:13,085 --> 00:27:15,313
- Do you think I'm making it up?
- Of course not.

312
00:27:15,337 --> 00:27:17,670
But yesterday, a patient in your care

313
00:27:17,756 --> 00:27:20,214
killed herself brutally in front of you.

314
00:27:21,176 --> 00:27:23,088
Is it possible, when you presumed

315
00:27:23,178 --> 00:27:25,115
that Carl Renken was a danger to himself,

316
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:27,435
that that's what your mind
was reacting to?

317
00:27:30,853 --> 00:27:34,642
I suppose I could've misinterpreted
the situation and overreacted.

318
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:38,526
Okay.

319
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,318
So, here's what's gonna happen.

320
00:27:42,531 --> 00:27:44,568
You're gonna take a paid week off.

321
00:27:44,658 --> 00:27:46,469
Morgan, that's really not necessary.

322
00:27:46,493 --> 00:27:49,861
You've been working 80-hour weeks
for months.

323
00:27:49,955 --> 00:27:52,743
I'm concerned
that you haven't been sleeping.

324
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:56,646
We can't help these patients unless
we have our own mental health in check.

325
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,523
And it's in the unit's best interest

326
00:27:58,547 --> 00:28:00,733
if you just take a week
and clear your head.

327
00:28:00,757 --> 00:28:03,875
Just do what you gotta do
and come back focused, okay?

328
00:31:17,037 --> 00:31:18,244
Fuck!

329
00:32:28,525 --> 00:32:31,689
- Hello?
- This is First Line Security.

330
00:32:31,778 --> 00:32:34,020
May I have your name and the passcode?

331
00:32:34,114 --> 00:32:36,071
Uh, Rose Cotter.

332
00:32:36,158 --> 00:32:37,524
Um, "Acapulco."

333
00:32:37,617 --> 00:32:39,512
Ma'am, we've detected a door alarm.

334
00:32:39,536 --> 00:32:43,325
Yeah, uh, the... the back door
of my house is open.

335
00:32:43,415 --> 00:32:45,273
Are you alone in the house, ma'am?

336
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,991
Yes.

337
00:32:47,085 --> 00:32:48,371
Are you sure?

338
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:50,995
What?

339
00:32:51,089 --> 00:32:54,082
Are you sure you haven't
let something inside, Rose?

340
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:58,423
Look behind you.

341
00:33:29,002 --> 00:33:30,083
Shit.

342
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:39,135
Hello?

343
00:33:39,221 --> 00:33:40,757
This is First Line Security.

344
00:33:40,847 --> 00:33:42,924
May I have your name and the passcode?

345
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:06,687
We did a full sweep inside and out.
It's all clear.

346
00:34:07,082 --> 00:34:09,415
Um, what about the back door?

347
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:12,889
Is it possible it wasn't fully latched
last time it was closed?

348
00:34:14,172 --> 00:34:16,334
I... I don't know. Maybe.

349
00:34:16,424 --> 00:34:17,735
Hey, I wouldn't worry about it.

350
00:34:17,759 --> 00:34:20,342
These false alarms happen all the time.

351
00:34:20,428 --> 00:34:23,106
If anything else comes up,
you can give us a call.

352
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:24,890
Okay.

353
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:27,308
Evening, sir.

354
00:34:27,394 --> 00:34:29,886
Um, evening.

355
00:34:33,692 --> 00:34:34,899
What happened?

356
00:34:38,488 --> 00:34:39,649
Mustache?

357
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:43,190
Mustache.

358
00:34:43,285 --> 00:34:46,699
So, is there a reason you set the alarm?

359
00:34:48,665 --> 00:34:50,518
I literally don't remember doing it.

360
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:53,548
I must have just, like,
set it by accident or something.

361
00:34:55,297 --> 00:34:56,583
By accident?

362
00:34:58,258 --> 00:34:59,624
Sorry. Sorry.

363
00:34:59,718 --> 00:35:04,759
My head has just been in this, like,
foggy, creepy, spacey place all day.

364
00:35:04,848 --> 00:35:07,807
And there was this weird incident at work
and then...

365
00:35:07,892 --> 00:35:10,100
and then my boss is making me take a...

366
00:35:14,107 --> 00:35:16,474
Sorry.

367
00:35:16,568 --> 00:35:19,527
- Everything is okay.
- Are you sure?

368
00:35:19,613 --> 00:35:22,481
No, no, I'm fine. I was just venting.

369
00:35:24,534 --> 00:35:25,741
Okay.

370
00:35:30,832 --> 00:35:32,602
Can you see if you can find Mustache?

371
00:35:32,626 --> 00:35:34,539
I haven't seen him anywhere at all.

372
00:35:34,586 --> 00:35:35,702
Yeah.

373
00:35:42,344 --> 00:35:44,506
Rose, did you break another glass?

374
00:35:49,392 --> 00:35:50,599
Mustache?

375
00:35:54,147 --> 00:35:55,479
Come on, kitty.

376
00:35:58,151 --> 00:36:00,188
Please. Please.

377
00:36:04,115 --> 00:36:05,356
Mustache.

378
00:37:01,172 --> 00:37:03,734
It looks like people.
It looks like different people.

379
00:37:03,758 --> 00:37:06,320
Sometimes it pretends
to be someone that I know.

380
00:37:06,344 --> 00:37:09,132
Sometimes it's a random stranger.
Sometimes...

381
00:37:09,222 --> 00:37:11,760
Sometimes it looks like my grandfather

382
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:14,638
who died in front of me when I was seven.

383
00:37:14,728 --> 00:37:17,220
But it's all the same thing. It...

384
00:37:17,313 --> 00:37:19,976
It's smiling at me,
but not a friendly smile.

385
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:22,294
It's the worst smile
I've ever seen in my life.

386
00:37:22,318 --> 00:37:25,089
And whenever I see it,
I just get this god-awful feeling

387
00:37:25,113 --> 00:37:28,277
like something really terrible
is gonna happen.

388
00:37:29,617 --> 00:37:32,405
Oh, my God! No! No!

389
00:37:32,495 --> 00:37:35,238
No! It's here! Please!

390
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:38,119
Get away! Please! No!

391
00:37:39,711 --> 00:37:41,939
I... I have
a patient emergency in eval 2.

392
00:37:41,963 --> 00:37:44,706
I need staff here now. Hurry.

393
00:37:46,551 --> 00:37:47,758
Laura?

394
00:37:58,772 --> 00:37:59,853
Laura?

395
00:38:11,117 --> 00:38:12,904
Laura?

396
00:38:12,994 --> 00:38:15,111
Rose.

397
00:38:23,171 --> 00:38:24,537
Laura?

398
00:38:33,473 --> 00:38:34,964
Rose!

399
00:38:46,236 --> 00:38:47,397
Rose?

400
00:38:47,487 --> 00:38:50,321
Whoa! Oh, my God! Rose! Rose! Whoa, whoa!

401
00:38:50,406 --> 00:38:52,773
What the fuck? Rose, put the knife down!

402
00:38:57,038 --> 00:38:58,038
Rose!

403
00:39:16,474 --> 00:39:17,590
Hi.

404
00:39:19,394 --> 00:39:20,635
Rose?

405
00:39:22,146 --> 00:39:23,728
This is a surprise.

406
00:39:26,484 --> 00:39:29,192
It wasn't so much the blood.

407
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:30,486
It was, um...

408
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:33,526
her face.

409
00:39:33,616 --> 00:39:35,403
The look that she had.

410
00:39:36,661 --> 00:39:38,028
How did it make you feel?

411
00:39:41,374 --> 00:39:43,081
Terrified, obviously.

412
00:39:47,338 --> 00:39:48,829
Vulnerable.

413
00:39:49,424 --> 00:39:50,710
Guilty.

414
00:39:51,217 --> 00:39:52,217
Guilty?

415
00:39:53,052 --> 00:39:54,839
Well, she was my patient.

416
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:59,048
She was a disturbed young woman
you only met for ten minutes.

417
00:39:59,142 --> 00:40:01,008
Yeah. I just...

418
00:40:02,604 --> 00:40:04,373
I just feel like I've gotten stuck on it.

419
00:40:04,397 --> 00:40:06,810
I can't, you know, get it out of my head.

420
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,610
Have you considered
the reason you feel stuck

421
00:40:10,695 --> 00:40:13,428
could actually be more about
your mother's suicide?

422
00:40:18,077 --> 00:40:20,034
Do you still blame yourself?

423
00:40:21,956 --> 00:40:23,618
That...

424
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:25,436
I'm really not trying to relitigate

425
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,248
that part of my life right now. So...

426
00:40:29,964 --> 00:40:31,876
What would you like to talk about?

427
00:40:33,176 --> 00:40:38,968
I was hoping that I could get
a script for Risperdal.

428
00:40:45,229 --> 00:40:46,595
Ever since that...

429
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,391
patient, I've been, um...

430
00:40:52,236 --> 00:40:54,068
seeing things

431
00:40:55,156 --> 00:40:56,818
and hearing things.

432
00:40:58,326 --> 00:41:01,160
I'm sure it's just a symptom
of post-trauma.

433
00:41:01,245 --> 00:41:03,658
Let's avoid any self-diagnosis.

434
00:41:05,249 --> 00:41:07,545
What is it you've been seeing and hearing?

435
00:41:11,297 --> 00:41:14,085
Echoes of what happened with my patient.

436
00:41:14,175 --> 00:41:16,667
You know, just fleeting moments

437
00:41:16,761 --> 00:41:18,969
of stress-induced hallucinations.

438
00:41:20,515 --> 00:41:24,350
But when they're happening,
they feel so...

439
00:41:25,687 --> 00:41:29,476
corporeal and unsettling.

440
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,458
Rose, from where I'm sitting, you don't
seem delusional or disordered to me.

441
00:41:35,989 --> 00:41:37,946
And certainly not psychotic.

442
00:41:38,032 --> 00:41:40,820
It's my impression
this experience with your patient

443
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:44,807
triggered old anxieties compounded
with too much stress, not enough sleep.

444
00:41:44,831 --> 00:41:48,495
You have wounds
that have never fully healed.

445
00:41:50,712 --> 00:41:53,941
It is possible they never will completely.
That's the nature of trauma.

446
00:41:53,965 --> 00:41:57,299
But you can learn to get control over it.

447
00:41:58,845 --> 00:42:01,804
Have you been continuing to see patients

448
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:03,701
while you've been coping with all this?

449
00:42:03,725 --> 00:42:07,514
- No. I'm just taking a short hiatus.
- Good.

450
00:42:09,063 --> 00:42:10,645
If you want my advice,

451
00:42:10,732 --> 00:42:12,459
use this time to do something different.

452
00:42:12,483 --> 00:42:14,770
Anything that will take your mind off

453
00:42:14,861 --> 00:42:17,102
the triggers that are causing you stress.

454
00:42:17,155 --> 00:42:20,614
I also think it would be helpful

455
00:42:21,701 --> 00:42:24,193
if we resumed our regular sessions again.

456
00:42:29,292 --> 00:42:30,499
Sure.

457
00:42:35,423 --> 00:42:38,336
And what about the Risperdal?
Just... You know.

458
00:42:38,426 --> 00:42:42,010
Let's talk again next week
before we consider any medication.

459
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,427
In the meantime, you can always call me.

460
00:42:50,313 --> 00:42:51,474
Sure.

461
00:43:23,971 --> 00:43:25,908
I asked you for a white wine spritzer.

462
00:43:25,932 --> 00:43:27,298
Jesus.

463
00:43:28,392 --> 00:43:30,930
- Oh, my God. You made it.
- Hi. Surprise.

464
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,660
- Come on in. Come on in.
- Oh.

465
00:43:33,439 --> 00:43:35,351
I thought you had to work?

466
00:43:35,441 --> 00:43:38,003
- Oh, I decided to take the afternoon...
- I'll take that.

467
00:43:38,027 --> 00:43:39,689
Hey, Greg. What are you doing?

468
00:43:39,779 --> 00:43:42,174
- I told you not to take those out yet.
- Mmm, mmm.

469
00:43:42,198 --> 00:43:43,484
Geez.

470
00:43:43,574 --> 00:43:45,761
Uh, ladies, I have to go corral
my dipshit husband.

471
00:43:45,785 --> 00:43:48,555
Would one of you please show my sister
to the adult refreshments?

472
00:43:48,579 --> 00:43:51,039
Sure. We have a stash
in the kitchen. Come on.

473
00:43:51,082 --> 00:43:53,165
Wait. You're that therapist, right?

474
00:43:53,251 --> 00:43:54,287
Yes, I... I am.

475
00:43:54,377 --> 00:43:56,345
Oh! Fantastic. Can I ask for advice?

476
00:43:56,379 --> 00:44:02,250
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

477
00:44:02,343 --> 00:44:07,509
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

478
00:44:07,598 --> 00:44:10,636
♪ Happy birthday... ♪

479
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,379
So cool.

480
00:44:40,464 --> 00:44:43,582
Gracias, Harper. Gracias, Harper's mom.

481
00:44:48,681 --> 00:44:50,468
Ooh, that one's from Aunt Rose.

482
00:44:53,436 --> 00:44:54,517
Open it!

483
00:44:55,688 --> 00:44:57,020
Rip it open!

484
00:45:12,538 --> 00:45:14,014
What'd you get, sweetheart?

485
00:45:28,346 --> 00:45:30,008
No. No.

486
00:45:30,097 --> 00:45:33,465
- Oh, my God.
- No, no. Mustache.

487
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,807
What the hell is wrong with you?

488
00:45:38,898 --> 00:45:40,389
This can't be happening.

489
00:45:45,404 --> 00:45:48,897
No. No, no.
No, I promise you, this wasn't me.

490
00:45:48,991 --> 00:45:52,325
It wasn't. It wasn't me, I swear.

491
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:55,449
You have to...
You guys have to believe me, please.

492
00:45:55,539 --> 00:45:58,532
Somebody please fucking believe me.

493
00:46:07,593 --> 00:46:11,507
What the fuck are you?
Leave me the fuck alone!

494
00:46:11,597 --> 00:46:14,715
You see her. You have to see her.

495
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:17,722
Please, Holly,
tell me that you see somebody.

496
00:46:17,812 --> 00:46:18,848
Please.

497
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:28,857
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

498
00:46:50,428 --> 00:46:52,044
Hey, Rose.

499
00:46:52,888 --> 00:46:53,888
Fuck.

500
00:46:55,474 --> 00:46:57,119
I heard you were brought into the ER.

501
00:46:57,143 --> 00:46:59,712
I wanted to come check on you.
How're you doing?

502
00:47:00,062 --> 00:47:01,553
Fine.

503
00:47:01,647 --> 00:47:04,390
It was just an accident. Thank you.

504
00:47:04,483 --> 00:47:08,648
Yeah. They... They said that you had
had a anxiety attack.

505
00:47:09,989 --> 00:47:12,134
Rose, I'll be honest with you,
I'm... I'm concerned.

506
00:47:12,158 --> 00:47:13,635
And I... I mean this as your friend,

507
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:15,929
but I really think
you should speak to someone.

508
00:47:15,953 --> 00:47:18,522
Are you seeing anybody
professionally right now?

509
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,082
Rose, are you listening?

510
00:47:50,905 --> 00:47:51,905
Wait.

511
00:47:52,907 --> 00:47:54,819
I need to tell you something,

512
00:47:54,909 --> 00:48:00,621
and I need you to know
that I'm not crazy, okay?

513
00:48:01,374 --> 00:48:02,374
Okay.

514
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:03,494
Okay.

515
00:48:06,879 --> 00:48:10,964
Something is happening to me.

516
00:48:15,012 --> 00:48:17,755
And it's gonna be really hard
for you to believe.

517
00:48:20,851 --> 00:48:22,888
Maybe we should just go inside.

518
00:48:22,978 --> 00:48:26,016
No, wait. Just listen to me! Sorry. Sorry.

519
00:48:26,982 --> 00:48:28,314
I'm really sorry.

520
00:48:28,984 --> 00:48:30,225
Okay, um...

521
00:48:32,321 --> 00:48:33,937
Something is threatening me.

522
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:40,411
Some kind of a evil spirit, or energy.

523
00:48:40,496 --> 00:48:45,116
I... I don't really know what it is, but...

524
00:48:45,209 --> 00:48:48,623
but I think that it...
it killed my patient.

525
00:48:48,712 --> 00:48:53,127
Because she described experiencing
the same thing before she died.

526
00:48:53,217 --> 00:48:56,961
And now it's somehow
attached itself to me.

527
00:48:58,556 --> 00:48:59,592
And...

528
00:49:01,058 --> 00:49:02,244
I'm just really scared

529
00:49:02,268 --> 00:49:04,851
that something bad is going to happen.

530
00:49:11,193 --> 00:49:13,185
I really need you to say something.

531
00:49:14,321 --> 00:49:16,062
What do you want me to say?

532
00:49:20,703 --> 00:49:22,070
I want you to believe me.

533
00:49:22,163 --> 00:49:24,349
Rose, you're talking about
a fucking ghost.

534
00:49:24,373 --> 00:49:26,330
No, no, no. It's not...

535
00:49:26,417 --> 00:49:27,703
It's not a ghost.

536
00:49:28,752 --> 00:49:30,414
It's something else.

537
00:49:30,504 --> 00:49:31,711
Okay.

538
00:49:35,551 --> 00:49:36,837
I'm sorry.

539
00:49:38,053 --> 00:49:39,089
I can't.

540
00:49:40,055 --> 00:49:41,908
I cannot fucking do this right now.

541
00:49:41,932 --> 00:49:43,423
No. Trevor.

542
00:49:43,517 --> 00:49:45,703
Whoa, wait. No, no, no. Don't walk away.

543
00:49:47,062 --> 00:49:49,791
I need you...
You're not listening to what I am saying.

544
00:49:49,815 --> 00:49:51,351
Okay, Rose.

545
00:49:51,442 --> 00:49:55,937
What the fuck am I supposed to say
to respond to this right now?

546
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:58,592
Do you hear yourself?
I mean, Jesus Christ. You sound crazy.

547
00:49:58,616 --> 00:50:00,323
I am not crazy!

548
00:50:00,409 --> 00:50:02,241
Sorry. Sorry.

549
00:50:03,204 --> 00:50:04,911
But it's genetic, isn't it?

550
00:50:06,081 --> 00:50:07,288
What?

551
00:50:08,626 --> 00:50:09,958
Mental illness.

552
00:50:10,961 --> 00:50:13,044
You can inherit it from a parent.

553
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:14,130
I looked it up.

554
00:50:14,215 --> 00:50:15,691
Why would you look that up?

555
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:18,424
Because...

556
00:50:18,511 --> 00:50:22,596
I wanted to know what I was
potentially hitching my entire life to.

557
00:50:24,099 --> 00:50:25,806
Is that so fucking unfair?

558
00:50:28,646 --> 00:50:30,103
I'm going in the house.

559
00:50:30,189 --> 00:50:32,485
No, no, no. Please, Trevor. I'm in danger!

560
00:50:32,566 --> 00:50:33,602
Rose.

561
00:50:34,485 --> 00:50:36,568
- Did you kill Mustache?
- N... No!

562
00:50:36,654 --> 00:50:40,318
No! That was not... That was not me.

563
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:43,491
Then tell me, what happened to him?

564
00:50:45,162 --> 00:50:47,449
It was the thing.

565
00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:50,661
Trevor, please.

566
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:52,458
Please. Please.

567
00:50:53,796 --> 00:50:55,788
Please. Please.

568
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:12,114
Rose.

569
00:52:21,383 --> 00:52:22,544
Come here.

570
00:52:52,331 --> 00:52:53,331
Rose.

571
00:52:56,377 --> 00:52:57,584
Baby...

572
00:52:58,796 --> 00:53:01,459
Please. Help me.

573
00:53:02,966 --> 00:53:05,925
- Mommy made a mistake.
- No, no, no.

574
00:53:08,722 --> 00:53:09,963
No, no, no.

575
00:53:13,143 --> 00:53:14,429
Rose!

576
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,705
Look where you're going!

577
00:53:15,729 --> 00:53:18,016
- Are you crazy?
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

578
00:53:40,921 --> 00:53:42,082
Mrs. Muñoz?

579
00:53:45,092 --> 00:53:48,927
At first,
I noticed small changes in him.

580
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:54,136
Then it all happened so fast.

581
00:53:56,186 --> 00:53:57,597
He was on edge.

582
00:53:58,522 --> 00:53:59,854
Paranoid.

583
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:04,859
He would wake up
in the middle of the night, screaming.

584
00:54:07,156 --> 00:54:09,273
I'd never heard him scream before.

585
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:14,744
Then he just stopped sleeping altogether.

586
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:21,284
I would catch him having
these conversations with himself.

587
00:54:21,378 --> 00:54:22,869
He was seeing things.

588
00:54:23,881 --> 00:54:27,340
Doing strange things
that he didn't even seem to remember.

589
00:54:28,135 --> 00:54:29,967
Then one morning he was gone.

590
00:54:31,597 --> 00:54:35,637
That night, the police called
and told me he was dead.

591
00:54:39,354 --> 00:54:41,267
They asked me to identify his body.

592
00:54:42,316 --> 00:54:44,433
His face.

593
00:54:46,737 --> 00:54:48,899
Twenty-five years of marriage,

594
00:54:48,989 --> 00:54:51,777
and that's what I have left
to remember him.

595
00:54:55,662 --> 00:54:57,494
I'm so sorry.

596
00:55:08,509 --> 00:55:13,595
Did Gabriel ever describe
the things that he was seeing?

597
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:19,517
I'll show you.

598
00:55:31,323 --> 00:55:33,280
I should take it all down,

599
00:55:34,368 --> 00:55:36,280
but I can't stand being in here.

600
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,797
This is what Gabriel said he saw.

601
00:56:06,233 --> 00:56:10,147
He kept saying it was trying
to get inside of him.

602
00:56:12,739 --> 00:56:15,402
That is Gabriel's brother.

603
00:56:15,492 --> 00:56:19,031
He died in an accident 20 years ago.

604
00:56:19,121 --> 00:56:22,114
Gabriel never got over it.

605
00:56:22,207 --> 00:56:23,994
How long had this been going on?

606
00:56:24,084 --> 00:56:25,144
Ever since he got back

607
00:56:25,168 --> 00:56:27,955
from that damn conference
he would go to every year.

608
00:56:29,506 --> 00:56:32,624
It was because he saw
that awful woman kill herself.

609
00:56:34,428 --> 00:56:36,090
But no one reports on that.

610
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,508
He watched someone die by suicide?

611
00:56:43,228 --> 00:56:44,228
Yes.

612
00:56:44,938 --> 00:56:46,082
I assumed you knew this.

613
00:56:46,106 --> 00:56:47,392
What was her name?

614
00:56:48,859 --> 00:56:51,146
I don't remember. I'd have to find it.

615
00:56:56,533 --> 00:56:59,025
Did... Did he ever, um...

616
00:57:01,288 --> 00:57:03,141
say why all of this was happening?

617
00:57:03,165 --> 00:57:06,499
Did he find any explanation
in all of this?

618
00:57:08,587 --> 00:57:10,148
What kind of reporter are you?

619
00:57:10,172 --> 00:57:14,633
Mrs. Muñoz, your husband was not insane.

620
00:57:14,718 --> 00:57:18,177
The things that he was seeing,
they're real. I've seen them.

621
00:57:18,263 --> 00:57:21,097
What are you, a fucking nutcase?

622
00:57:21,183 --> 00:57:22,827
- What?
- Some kind of morbid fanatic?

623
00:57:22,851 --> 00:57:24,558
How fucking dare you?

624
00:57:24,645 --> 00:57:26,011
No, please. Please.

625
00:57:26,104 --> 00:57:28,812
What happened to your husband
is happening to me.

626
00:57:28,899 --> 00:57:31,085
Out of my house.
I want you out of my house, now.

627
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:33,463
Just please give me the name.
Please, just give me the name!

628
00:57:33,487 --> 00:57:35,900
Get the fuck out of my house!

629
00:58:11,984 --> 00:58:13,600
Oh, fuck. Shit.

630
00:58:26,498 --> 00:58:27,614
Yeah?

631
00:58:34,214 --> 00:58:35,295
Hey.

632
00:58:42,055 --> 00:58:43,387
Come on in.

633
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,654
Finally got rid of that ugly yellow couch.

634
00:59:03,952 --> 00:59:05,944
So, uh, what's up?

635
00:59:07,205 --> 00:59:09,142
I assume you're not here to catch up

636
00:59:09,166 --> 00:59:12,079
considering the cold shoulder
the other day.

637
00:59:14,046 --> 00:59:16,288
I need a favor.

638
00:59:16,381 --> 00:59:18,693
I need you to not ask
any questions about it.

639
00:59:18,717 --> 00:59:21,505
Terrific. Yeah, let's hear that.

640
00:59:21,595 --> 00:59:23,427
Uh, so, nine days ago,

641
00:59:23,513 --> 00:59:27,006
a man named Gabriel Muñoz killed himself.

642
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:32,812
I need to know if he had been involved in
any other recent police reports.

643
00:59:32,898 --> 00:59:35,436
Can you find that out? Here, for me.

644
00:59:35,525 --> 00:59:37,232
Come on. Are you serious?

645
00:59:39,029 --> 00:59:41,487
This is my one day off. Go to the station.

646
00:59:41,573 --> 00:59:42,905
Joel, please?

647
00:59:49,831 --> 00:59:50,831
Fine.

648
00:59:51,875 --> 00:59:53,161
Goddamn it.

649
00:59:57,798 --> 00:59:59,711
All right, what was his name again?

650
01:00:00,258 --> 01:00:01,920
Gabriel Muñoz.

651
01:00:10,227 --> 01:00:12,970
All right. I see the report on his death.

652
01:00:13,063 --> 01:00:15,291
Yeah. There's another incident report here

653
01:00:15,315 --> 01:00:17,773
from a week earlier,
from a precinct upstate.

654
01:00:17,859 --> 01:00:20,897
- What was it for?
- He gave a witness statement.

655
01:00:20,987 --> 01:00:23,674
He was staying at a hotel
where a woman committed suicide.

656
01:00:23,698 --> 01:00:26,441
Okay, um... And what was her name?
The woman?

657
01:00:32,082 --> 01:00:33,994
Angela Powell.

658
01:00:34,084 --> 01:00:35,575
She's a real estate agent.

659
01:00:35,669 --> 01:00:36,750
What is this?

660
01:00:39,005 --> 01:00:40,962
- Fuck.
- What? What is it?

661
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:43,611
It's a picture from the scene.

662
01:00:43,635 --> 01:00:45,592
- Let me see it.
- No.

663
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:47,046
- Let me see it.
- No, no.

664
01:00:47,139 --> 01:00:49,325
Look, you don't wanna see this.
This is, like, evidence.

665
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:51,511
Or, just, you know, have at it.

666
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,141
Holy shit.

667
01:00:57,774 --> 01:00:59,481
Told you it was gross.

668
01:01:01,611 --> 01:01:02,727
Okay, um...

669
01:01:04,739 --> 01:01:06,968
Okay, uh, I need you to do
the same search again,

670
01:01:06,992 --> 01:01:08,052
but this time on her.

671
01:01:08,076 --> 01:01:09,283
The woman, Angela.

672
01:01:09,369 --> 01:01:11,264
Can you please tell me
what this is all about?

673
01:01:11,288 --> 01:01:14,281
Joel, you said you weren't
gonna ask me any questions.

674
01:01:14,374 --> 01:01:16,519
No. You said I wouldn't ask you
any questions.

675
01:01:16,543 --> 01:01:18,409
Joel, I need your help.

676
01:01:19,462 --> 01:01:20,669
Okay?

677
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,086
Please?

678
01:01:44,279 --> 01:01:45,815
There was a previous report

679
01:01:45,906 --> 01:01:48,273
filed four days before her death.

680
01:01:49,743 --> 01:01:51,279
That's a weird coincidence.

681
01:01:51,369 --> 01:01:53,610
She was also interviewed about a suicide.

682
01:02:03,465 --> 01:02:05,832
What is this? Is that a video file?

683
01:02:09,262 --> 01:02:11,720
It's, um, security camera footage.

684
01:02:11,806 --> 01:02:14,799
- Put it... Put it on.
- Just... It's... It's loading.

685
01:02:24,778 --> 01:02:26,565
What the fuck is this?

686
01:02:59,062 --> 01:03:01,084
You know, my day was going just fine.

687
01:03:01,147 --> 01:03:03,184
- Can you rewind it?
- Really?

688
01:03:03,275 --> 01:03:04,811
Rewind it, Joel.

689
01:03:10,323 --> 01:03:11,323
Okay, stop.

690
01:03:17,956 --> 01:03:19,538
Is he smiling?

691
01:03:28,925 --> 01:03:30,666
Rose, who are these people?

692
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:40,426
I have to go.

693
01:03:41,354 --> 01:03:42,686
Where are you going?

694
01:03:44,774 --> 01:03:47,437
Rose, where are you going?
What is going on here?

695
01:03:47,527 --> 01:03:48,984
I'm so confused right now.

696
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:50,655
Can you do me one more favor?

697
01:03:51,406 --> 01:03:52,738
Do you have a printer?

698
01:04:31,905 --> 01:04:34,067
Trevor. Trevor, you here?

699
01:04:35,408 --> 01:04:36,524
Hey.

700
01:04:36,618 --> 01:04:37,984
Hi, Rose.

701
01:04:40,413 --> 01:04:42,655
What is this? What is she doing here?

702
01:04:42,749 --> 01:04:44,602
I wanted to see how you were doing.

703
01:04:44,626 --> 01:04:46,458
I was talking to my fiancé.

704
01:04:48,213 --> 01:04:49,213
I called her.

705
01:04:51,424 --> 01:04:52,424
Why?

706
01:04:54,135 --> 01:04:58,596
Because you've been acting
completely unhinged.

707
01:04:58,681 --> 01:04:59,681
I... I don't...

708
01:04:59,766 --> 01:05:01,702
And I... I didn't know what else to do.

709
01:05:01,726 --> 01:05:03,308
Are you fucking kidding me?

710
01:05:04,813 --> 01:05:08,365
I came to you, the person
I'm supposed to trust most in the world,

711
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,394
and I... I confided
that I was scared to death.

712
01:05:13,071 --> 01:05:15,688
That I needed you.

713
01:05:17,575 --> 01:05:19,678
And you didn't listen
to a word I was saying.

714
01:05:19,702 --> 01:05:22,194
No. Why do you think I even called her?

715
01:05:22,288 --> 01:05:24,496
All I'm trying to do here is help you.

716
01:05:24,582 --> 01:05:27,561
No! All you're trying to do is make it
so you don't have to deal with it.

717
01:05:27,585 --> 01:05:31,204
You're fine as long as everything
is easy and agreeable,

718
01:05:31,297 --> 01:05:33,755
but God forbid anything become real,

719
01:05:33,842 --> 01:05:35,583
or even a tiny bit difficult.

720
01:05:35,677 --> 01:05:37,418
And... And you just...

721
01:05:37,512 --> 01:05:41,534
You think about how it's gonna fuck up
your whole little perfect life plan.

722
01:05:41,558 --> 01:05:44,426
- Are you serious right now?
- Yeah.

723
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:47,416
If that's how you feel,
then why are we even together?

724
01:05:48,106 --> 01:05:49,438
Maybe I just don't know.

725
01:05:49,524 --> 01:05:50,960
Why don't we all just take a breath...

726
01:05:50,984 --> 01:05:53,977
Why don't you just
fucking make yourself at home!

727
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:56,733
Rose, are you actually leaving right now?

728
01:06:08,501 --> 01:06:10,633
- Greg.
- Rose, what are you doing here?

729
01:06:10,712 --> 01:06:13,816
- Is Holly here? I need to talk to her.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

730
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,943
Greg, let me talk to my fucking sister.
Holly!

731
01:06:15,967 --> 01:06:17,528
You're gonna come
and talk to me like that?

732
01:06:17,552 --> 01:06:19,321
Holly, can I talk to you,
just for one sec?

733
01:06:19,345 --> 01:06:21,031
- No, I don't think...
- Can I please talk to you?

734
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,867
I don't think this is a good idea.
Honestly.

735
01:06:22,891 --> 01:06:24,702
- Yeah, it's fine. It's fine.
- Holly.

736
01:06:24,726 --> 01:06:27,732
- Just go the fuck inside.
- I don't... All right. Fine.

737
01:06:28,730 --> 01:06:29,937
Jesus.

738
01:06:31,232 --> 01:06:32,564
Okay, okay, okay.

739
01:06:35,236 --> 01:06:36,397
How are you?

740
01:06:37,405 --> 01:06:40,819
My eyes are open now.

741
01:06:41,951 --> 01:06:44,864
I have been cursed.

742
01:06:45,455 --> 01:06:46,455
Okay, uh...

743
01:06:46,539 --> 01:06:48,576
Or somehow wrapped up in a curse.

744
01:06:48,666 --> 01:06:50,532
I... I got it from my patient.

745
01:06:50,627 --> 01:06:54,440
She was cursed, and then when she died,
she... she transferred it to me.

746
01:06:54,464 --> 01:06:59,835
And now I'm being threatened
by this... this entity.

747
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,211
- By an entity?
- No, no.

748
01:07:02,305 --> 01:07:03,741
It... It's what killed Mustache.

749
01:07:03,765 --> 01:07:07,349
It was at the party yesterday,
but you couldn't see it.

750
01:07:07,435 --> 01:07:09,848
Nobody else can see it, except for me.

751
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:11,480
Jesus Christ.

752
01:07:11,564 --> 01:07:12,725
No, look, Holly,

753
01:07:12,815 --> 01:07:14,852
I know it's so hard to believe,

754
01:07:14,943 --> 01:07:17,588
and it was difficult for me
to believe it at first either.

755
01:07:17,612 --> 01:07:19,353
But look... look at this. Look.

756
01:07:19,447 --> 01:07:22,815
Oh, my God. Rose.
Why the fuck do you have that?

757
01:07:22,909 --> 01:07:24,720
Because this has happened to other people.

758
01:07:24,744 --> 01:07:26,222
- And they're all dead.
- Rose.

759
01:07:26,246 --> 01:07:27,723
And I... Holly, I'm gonna be next!

760
01:07:27,747 --> 01:07:29,989
Rose, curses are not real.

761
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:32,160
Okay? You are having some sort of a...

762
01:07:33,753 --> 01:07:35,494
a breakdown.

763
01:07:35,588 --> 01:07:38,205
What? No, no. Holly.

764
01:07:39,133 --> 01:07:40,374
You're not hearing me.

765
01:07:40,468 --> 01:07:43,256
- You are not hearing me.
- Rose.

766
01:07:43,346 --> 01:07:46,009
This is exactly what happened to Mom.

767
01:07:51,437 --> 01:07:52,928
You sound just like her.

768
01:07:58,486 --> 01:08:00,290
How the fuck would you know that?

769
01:08:00,905 --> 01:08:01,941
I'm sorry, what?

770
01:08:02,031 --> 01:08:04,009
You were never around when Mom got bad.

771
01:08:04,033 --> 01:08:05,761
Where the fuck were you when she died?

772
01:08:05,785 --> 01:08:08,448
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

773
01:08:08,538 --> 01:08:11,392
Okay? Because I was older,
I got the worst of Mom's insanity.

774
01:08:11,416 --> 01:08:13,060
I had to fucking leave the house.

775
01:08:13,084 --> 01:08:15,792
That was the only way I... I could survive.

776
01:08:17,338 --> 01:08:19,421
And I'm... I'm sorry

777
01:08:20,925 --> 01:08:24,714
that I left you alone and that
you had to be the one to find her.

778
01:08:24,804 --> 01:08:26,921
I know that that fucked you up, and...

779
01:08:28,182 --> 01:08:29,577
And I know that that's not fair.

780
01:08:29,601 --> 01:08:31,120
I wish I could do something about it,

781
01:08:31,144 --> 01:08:33,747
but, Rose, I have tried so hard
to move on with my life,

782
01:08:33,771 --> 01:08:35,874
to leave all of that shit behind me, okay?

783
01:08:35,898 --> 01:08:38,106
You, it's like you can't accept the fact

784
01:08:38,192 --> 01:08:40,504
that Mom lost her mind
and fucking killed herself.

785
01:08:40,528 --> 01:08:42,089
And you let it define your entire life,

786
01:08:42,113 --> 01:08:43,966
and you punish me because I don't want to.

787
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:46,760
Well, I'm sorry that I'm actually
trying to help people

788
01:08:46,784 --> 01:08:50,403
instead of being some fucking
stay-at-home PTA housewife,

789
01:08:50,496 --> 01:08:54,706
who lives in her own self-centered,
smug little bubble!

790
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:01,463
- Okay.
- I don't know why I said that.

791
01:09:03,384 --> 01:09:07,072
You know what, I'm... I'm not doing this.
I'm not doing this with you.

792
01:09:07,096 --> 01:09:09,446
You've completely
traumatized Jackson, okay?

793
01:09:10,933 --> 01:09:13,393
I can't have you around
when you're like this.

794
01:09:24,822 --> 01:09:25,983
Fuck.

795
01:09:27,533 --> 01:09:28,569
Fuck.

796
01:09:57,897 --> 01:09:59,609
Holly?

797
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:13,448
Fuck! Fuck!

798
01:10:16,582 --> 01:10:18,699
Fuck!

799
01:10:19,502 --> 01:10:21,084
Motherfucker!

800
01:11:28,654 --> 01:11:29,654
Joel?

801
01:11:29,739 --> 01:11:33,653
Why didn't you tell me about
your patient's connection to the others?

802
01:11:33,743 --> 01:11:35,471
- Wha...
- after you left, I kept digging.

803
01:11:35,495 --> 01:11:37,236
These cases?

804
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:39,099
This same pattern. It goes back further.

805
01:11:39,123 --> 01:11:42,019
So far, I've found 20 cases
involving 19 suicide victims

806
01:11:42,043 --> 01:11:44,104
with a direct line
linking them all together.

807
01:11:44,128 --> 01:11:47,024
And the things these people
are doing to themselves, Rose.

808
01:11:47,048 --> 01:11:48,289
Holy shit.

809
01:11:48,382 --> 01:11:52,092
Wait, you said, um, 20 cases,
but only 19 suicides.

810
01:11:52,178 --> 01:11:53,864
One of the cases mixes up the pattern.

811
01:11:53,888 --> 01:11:55,595
Some accountant, Robert Talley.

812
01:11:55,681 --> 01:11:58,243
His business partner commits suicide
right in front of him,

813
01:11:58,267 --> 01:11:59,745
and four days later, Talley goes

814
01:11:59,769 --> 01:12:01,789
and fucking murders a woman
he's never met before,

815
01:12:01,813 --> 01:12:03,165
completely out of the blue.

816
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:05,397
But get this, a week later,

817
01:12:05,483 --> 01:12:07,232
the key eyewitness to the murder

818
01:12:07,318 --> 01:12:09,310
also commits suicide.

819
01:12:09,403 --> 01:12:10,689
Pattern resumes.

820
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:12,737
- So, he's alive?
- Yeah.

821
01:12:12,824 --> 01:12:14,737
He's sitting in holding in Altoona.

822
01:12:15,076 --> 01:12:16,497
Joel, I gotta talk to him.

823
01:12:44,272 --> 01:12:45,666
I'm gonna need you to say something.

824
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:47,272
Yeah, I... I will.

825
01:12:47,358 --> 01:12:49,020
Just... Just...

826
01:12:51,153 --> 01:12:52,756
Give me a second. I mean, Jesus...

827
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:55,217
I thought you were gonna say
this was some kind of, like,

828
01:12:55,241 --> 01:12:57,779
crazy suicide cult, or blackmail scheme.

829
01:12:57,869 --> 01:13:00,875
- I mean, this? This is... This? This is...
- Hey, Joel.

830
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:03,790
Okay.

831
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:06,333
Let's just put aside the possibility

832
01:13:06,419 --> 01:13:09,698
that some sort of evil,
extraordinary force could even exist.

833
01:13:10,798 --> 01:13:14,132
What you're saying
is that this thing is jumping around

834
01:13:14,218 --> 01:13:15,425
from person to person,

835
01:13:15,511 --> 01:13:17,969
and it is causing them to kill themselves?

836
01:13:18,055 --> 01:13:20,297
Okay, but maybe it's not suicide.

837
01:13:20,391 --> 01:13:21,598
What do you mean?

838
01:13:21,684 --> 01:13:24,097
Okay. So, my patient, she was terrified,

839
01:13:24,186 --> 01:13:25,848
but she was not suicidal.

840
01:13:25,938 --> 01:13:29,102
And then at... at the end,
everything about her changed.

841
01:13:29,191 --> 01:13:34,653
It was like the person I had
been talking to was gone.

842
01:13:36,073 --> 01:13:39,942
And something else had taken over.

843
01:13:43,289 --> 01:13:45,702
So, it's kind of like the guy...

844
01:13:45,791 --> 01:13:47,644
- Yes.
- ...on the security camera footage?

845
01:13:47,668 --> 01:13:49,625
Yes. Yes. Exactly like that.

846
01:13:49,712 --> 01:13:52,420
Oh, my God. What the fuck?

847
01:13:58,721 --> 01:14:00,883
In the cases that you found, um...

848
01:14:02,892 --> 01:14:06,602
how long was it
between each victim's death?

849
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:13,141
None of them survived longer than a week.

850
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:20,240
Some of them didn't even
make it past four days.

851
01:14:26,374 --> 01:14:27,686
Today was my fourth day.

852
01:14:29,669 --> 01:14:30,785
Hey.

853
01:14:32,171 --> 01:14:33,565
Whatever happened to those people,

854
01:14:33,589 --> 01:14:35,376
it's not gonna happen to you.

855
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:39,341
I promise.

856
01:15:00,282 --> 01:15:02,194
Transfer guard to gate three.

857
01:15:02,284 --> 01:15:04,116
Transfer guard to gate three.

858
01:15:04,203 --> 01:15:05,203
Thank you.

859
01:15:05,287 --> 01:15:06,744
Give them a buzz through.

860
01:15:06,831 --> 01:15:08,914
They're clear.

861
01:15:09,917 --> 01:15:11,502
I owe you one for this, Doug.

862
01:15:11,544 --> 01:15:15,504
You're just lucky that he fired
every lawyer he was assigned.

863
01:15:15,589 --> 01:15:17,922
You do know what this guy did, right?

864
01:15:18,009 --> 01:15:20,237
Well, Dr. Cotter's building
a psychological profile

865
01:15:20,261 --> 01:15:21,877
on a similar case for us.

866
01:15:21,971 --> 01:15:24,839
Oh. Well,
Talley's a whole box of fruit loops.

867
01:15:24,932 --> 01:15:26,468
So, good luck.

868
01:15:26,559 --> 01:15:28,578
Look, you only got
ten minutes with him, okay?

869
01:15:28,602 --> 01:15:30,789
It's the best I could do
without a court order.

870
01:15:30,813 --> 01:15:32,429
Well, I appreciate it.

871
01:16:07,767 --> 01:16:10,510
Mr. Talley, my name is Dr. Rose Cotter,

872
01:16:10,603 --> 01:16:16,315
and, um, I was hoping you'd be willing
to answer some questions about...

873
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:18,813
I'm done answering questions. I confessed.

874
01:16:18,903 --> 01:16:22,317
I actually don't care about
what you were accused of.

875
01:16:22,406 --> 01:16:25,490
What I need to know
is what you experienced

876
01:16:25,576 --> 01:16:27,613
in the days leading up to it.

877
01:16:32,958 --> 01:16:34,574
I have a patient,

878
01:16:35,628 --> 01:16:36,994
a young woman.

879
01:16:38,923 --> 01:16:40,004
Four days ago,

880
01:16:40,091 --> 01:16:42,959
a man killed himself
right in front of her.

881
01:16:43,803 --> 01:16:48,389
And ever since then,
she has been seeing something.

882
01:16:51,477 --> 01:16:53,969
Something that pretends
to be other people.

883
01:16:54,897 --> 01:16:57,890
The man that she saw kill himself,

884
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:02,102
he claimed that he was seeing
the exact same thing.

885
01:17:02,196 --> 01:17:04,438
What the fuck do you want from me, huh?

886
01:17:04,532 --> 01:17:06,740
- What is it?
- I don't know.

887
01:17:08,077 --> 01:17:09,077
I don't know.

888
01:17:09,161 --> 01:17:10,555
Why is it that everybody else

889
01:17:10,579 --> 01:17:13,367
who's seen it is dead and you're alive?

890
01:17:13,457 --> 01:17:14,789
Why? Please.

891
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:17,037
Mr. Talley, you can help her. Okay?

892
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:18,751
Please.

893
01:17:23,467 --> 01:17:24,548
Make the cop leave.

894
01:17:26,512 --> 01:17:28,253
Not gonna happen, pal.

895
01:17:28,347 --> 01:17:31,840
Make him leave,
and I'll tell you what I know.

896
01:17:35,187 --> 01:17:36,553
Joel, please.

897
01:17:42,361 --> 01:17:43,943
I'll be outside, all right?

898
01:17:57,001 --> 01:18:00,480
I tried to research anything
and everything I could about this thing.

899
01:18:00,504 --> 01:18:02,791
There's been other chains in the past.

900
01:18:02,882 --> 01:18:05,590
Found one that was in Brazil
a few years ago.

901
01:18:08,512 --> 01:18:11,129
A man there escaped that chain

902
01:18:12,725 --> 01:18:16,059
by killing his neighbor
and passing it to his neighbor's wife.

903
01:18:16,937 --> 01:18:20,101
Your patient is going to die

904
01:18:20,191 --> 01:18:22,558
unless she kills someone.

905
01:18:22,651 --> 01:18:25,018
That's the only way you can get rid of it.

906
01:18:25,821 --> 01:18:27,278
The only way.

907
01:18:27,364 --> 01:18:30,093
She has to make sure there's
a witness for it to pass to,

908
01:18:30,117 --> 01:18:32,220
'cause this thing needs trauma to spread.

909
01:18:32,244 --> 01:18:35,863
That's what gives it power. Trauma.

910
01:18:35,956 --> 01:18:38,664
Your patient has to make it count.

911
01:18:38,751 --> 01:18:41,243
Tell her to use some kind of weapon.

912
01:18:41,337 --> 01:18:43,420
Make the biggest mess she can...

913
01:18:43,505 --> 01:18:46,213
I can't kill someone!

914
01:18:47,676 --> 01:18:48,757
You?

915
01:18:49,678 --> 01:18:51,670
You have it?

916
01:18:53,224 --> 01:18:56,888
No, no, no.
Why the fuck did you come here?

917
01:18:56,977 --> 01:18:58,726
You're not giving it back to me.

918
01:18:58,771 --> 01:19:00,763
- Get out of here!
- I'm sorry.

919
01:19:00,856 --> 01:19:02,063
Get out of here!

920
01:19:02,149 --> 01:19:03,981
Get her away from me!

921
01:19:04,068 --> 01:19:06,481
Get her away from me!

922
01:19:06,570 --> 01:19:08,653
Get her away from me!

923
01:19:08,739 --> 01:19:10,446
Get her away from me!

924
01:19:17,706 --> 01:19:18,867
Hey.

925
01:19:19,959 --> 01:19:21,541
Hey! Wait.

926
01:19:23,796 --> 01:19:25,709
- What happened in there?
- Nothing.

927
01:19:26,382 --> 01:19:27,589
What'd he say?

928
01:19:29,343 --> 01:19:30,459
Nothing.

929
01:19:31,262 --> 01:19:33,219
Nothing?

930
01:19:33,305 --> 01:19:35,218
He's out of his fucking mind, Joel.

931
01:21:19,787 --> 01:21:20,994
Ah, fuck.

932
01:22:16,179 --> 01:22:17,991
What are you doing here?

933
01:22:18,011 --> 01:22:19,906
I apologize
if you felt ambushed yesterday.

934
01:22:19,930 --> 01:22:21,637
That was the wrong approach.

935
01:22:21,723 --> 01:22:22,804
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

936
01:22:22,891 --> 01:22:25,178
- I think you should go.
- Rose.

937
01:22:25,269 --> 01:22:28,164
We both know I have a responsibility
to notify the authorities

938
01:22:28,188 --> 01:22:30,555
if you're a danger to yourself or others.

939
01:22:30,649 --> 01:22:33,382
I need you to help convince me
you're not a danger.

940
01:22:46,415 --> 01:22:48,929
Trevor mentioned there had been
talk of ghosts.

941
01:22:50,085 --> 01:22:52,077
I never used the word "ghosts."

942
01:22:53,797 --> 01:22:56,335
Evil beings, then. Paranormal.

943
01:22:59,011 --> 01:23:01,754
I admitted to him
that I was seeing things,

944
01:23:01,847 --> 01:23:03,324
the same thing that I told you.

945
01:23:03,348 --> 01:23:04,951
That's not happening anymore. Okay?

946
01:23:04,975 --> 01:23:08,594
It was stress and lack of sleep.

947
01:23:08,687 --> 01:23:11,474
I confided in him,
and that was obviously a mistake.

948
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:13,556
But that's it.

949
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:15,516
Okay? Are we good?

950
01:23:16,987 --> 01:23:19,070
How are you feeling today?

951
01:23:22,701 --> 01:23:23,942
Let me think, um...

952
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,416
I'm pretty sure my fiancé
thinks I'm crazy.

953
01:23:29,166 --> 01:23:34,207
My sister has just totally shut me out.

954
01:23:34,296 --> 01:23:35,707
And now

955
01:23:36,673 --> 01:23:38,164
my former therapist

956
01:23:38,258 --> 01:23:41,592
is making unannounced house calls

957
01:23:41,678 --> 01:23:44,091
to ensure that I am not a danger.

958
01:23:44,181 --> 01:23:47,720
So, other than that, I'm really good.

959
01:23:57,653 --> 01:23:59,440
Should you get that?

960
01:24:04,785 --> 01:24:05,785
What?

961
01:24:05,869 --> 01:24:08,577
Rose, it's Madeline.

962
01:24:08,664 --> 01:24:11,623
I've been trying your mobile all morning.

963
01:24:11,708 --> 01:24:14,605
I'm very concerned about
how we left things yesterday.

964
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:19,964
- Rose? Are you there?
- No.

965
01:24:25,347 --> 01:24:26,508
Hello?

966
01:24:27,474 --> 01:24:29,056
- No.
- Rose?

967
01:24:29,977 --> 01:24:31,889
No. No.

968
01:24:31,979 --> 01:24:34,062
Almost time, Rose.

969
01:24:35,649 --> 01:24:37,311
What the fuck are you?

970
01:24:40,988 --> 01:24:42,149
Ple... Please.

971
01:24:45,826 --> 01:24:46,942
No, no.

972
01:24:47,869 --> 01:24:49,656
No. No, no.

973
01:24:55,836 --> 01:24:57,043
No.

974
01:26:07,157 --> 01:26:09,069
Hey, Dr. Cotter.

975
01:26:09,159 --> 01:26:11,572
Aren't you supposed to be on leave?

976
01:26:11,662 --> 01:26:14,029
Just grabbing something from my office.

977
01:26:53,704 --> 01:26:55,616
Carl. Hi.

978
01:26:59,751 --> 01:27:01,287
- No. No.
- It's okay.

979
01:27:01,378 --> 01:27:02,960
No, no, no.

980
01:27:03,046 --> 01:27:04,787
- It's okay.
- Oh, God.

981
01:27:04,881 --> 01:27:06,964
No, no. Oh, no, no, no.

982
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:09,258
- Shh. Shh. Just calm down.
- No! No, no!

983
01:27:09,344 --> 01:27:12,382
- No! No!
- Shh! Shut the fuck up.

984
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:15,472
Just calm down, okay? Okay.

985
01:27:15,559 --> 01:27:16,720
Rose.

986
01:27:17,728 --> 01:27:19,040
What are you doing here?

987
01:27:22,399 --> 01:27:23,810
I don't know.

988
01:27:25,861 --> 01:27:27,853
Rose, you can't be around patients.

989
01:28:00,604 --> 01:28:02,186
Fuck! Rose!

990
01:28:22,375 --> 01:28:25,243
Fuck!

991
01:28:40,143 --> 01:28:41,930
Rose, what are you doing here?

992
01:28:42,729 --> 01:28:43,970
Nothing.

993
01:28:45,232 --> 01:28:46,814
I don't... I don't know.

994
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:49,859
I don't know why. I, uh...

995
01:28:49,945 --> 01:28:52,256
Why don't we go inside together
and we can just talk?

996
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:53,737
No! It's...

997
01:28:53,824 --> 01:28:55,031
It's not safe.

998
01:28:55,116 --> 01:28:57,512
Rose, I don't think you should
be alone right now.

999
01:28:57,536 --> 01:28:59,121
I need... I need to be alone.

1000
01:29:01,373 --> 01:29:03,330
I need to be... I need to be alone.

1001
01:29:05,627 --> 01:29:08,165
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I have to go.

1002
01:29:10,382 --> 01:29:12,902
Rose, I don't think you should
go anywhere, okay?

1003
01:29:12,926 --> 01:29:15,877
You just relax, I'm gonna make
a phone call, all right?

1004
01:29:17,055 --> 01:29:18,658
Rose. Rose, don't go anywhere.

1005
01:29:18,682 --> 01:29:20,048
Wait. Rose, please.

1006
01:29:20,141 --> 01:29:22,161
Please don't go anywhere, okay?
Just hang...

1007
01:29:22,185 --> 01:29:24,393
Rose. Rose, wait! Rose!

1008
01:29:50,589 --> 01:29:51,500
Joel.

1009
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:53,651
Rose, I saw a police APB
go out for you

1010
01:29:53,675 --> 01:29:55,611
that says you're dangerous.
What the fuck happened?

1011
01:29:55,635 --> 01:29:56,904
- I know what I need to do.
- What?

1012
01:29:56,928 --> 01:29:59,887
This thing, it needs all of its victims

1013
01:29:59,973 --> 01:30:01,576
to pass it on in order to survive,

1014
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,764
but if there's no one else around,
it has no way to pass.

1015
01:30:04,853 --> 01:30:06,264
As long as I'm alone,

1016
01:30:06,354 --> 01:30:07,999
I can deprive it of what it needs.

1017
01:30:08,023 --> 01:30:09,639
That doesn't make any sense.

1018
01:30:09,733 --> 01:30:11,919
Your plan is just to avoid people forever?

1019
01:30:11,943 --> 01:30:14,606
I am not gonna keep running, okay?

1020
01:30:15,447 --> 01:30:16,654
I've got to face it.

1021
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:19,527
Okay, Rose, I'm coming to you.
Just tell me where...

1022
01:33:49,452 --> 01:33:50,784
Rose.

1023
01:33:55,291 --> 01:33:56,498
Baby...

1024
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,832
Help me, please.

1025
01:34:07,846 --> 01:34:10,133
Mommy made a mistake.

1026
01:34:17,063 --> 01:34:18,599
Get the phone.

1027
01:34:19,899 --> 01:34:21,561
Call for help.

1028
01:34:31,911 --> 01:34:33,698
Rose!

1029
01:38:45,581 --> 01:38:47,914
Rose.

1030
01:38:53,589 --> 01:38:54,875
It's okay, baby.

1031
01:38:55,675 --> 01:38:56,882
Come here.

1032
01:39:08,312 --> 01:39:11,805
I am so sorry.

1033
01:39:14,444 --> 01:39:16,356
I... I haven't been a good mom.

1034
01:39:19,699 --> 01:39:24,694
I want to be. I really try to be.

1035
01:39:24,787 --> 01:39:30,749
But sometimes everything is just too much.

1036
01:39:32,253 --> 01:39:35,667
There is something terrible inside of me.

1037
01:39:36,716 --> 01:39:40,255
- I hate myself.
- Stop. Stop. Stop.

1038
01:39:40,970 --> 01:39:42,381
Are you ashamed of me?

1039
01:39:43,848 --> 01:39:44,848
No.

1040
01:39:45,641 --> 01:39:47,172
Then why did you let me die?

1041
01:39:51,314 --> 01:39:53,625
- Why didn't you save me?
- It's not my fault.

1042
01:39:53,649 --> 01:39:56,392
- You could have called for help.
- Stop. Stop it.

1043
01:39:56,486 --> 01:39:58,398
- But you didn't.
- Stop it.

1044
01:39:58,488 --> 01:40:01,425
- You wished that I would die.
- Because I was afraid of you!

1045
01:40:01,449 --> 01:40:03,987
I was ten years old

1046
01:40:05,286 --> 01:40:07,403
and you were a monster.

1047
01:40:10,124 --> 01:40:14,915
And I know that it's not fair.
You... You needed help.

1048
01:40:16,714 --> 01:40:18,000
But I couldn't.

1049
01:40:23,054 --> 01:40:25,011
And I have carried that guilt

1050
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:29,474
for my entire life.

1051
01:40:33,022 --> 01:40:36,390
And I... I have to let it go.

1052
01:40:38,653 --> 01:40:40,269
I ha... I have to let it go.

1053
01:40:47,245 --> 01:40:48,736
This is not real.

1054
01:40:49,664 --> 01:40:51,576
But Rose,

1055
01:40:51,666 --> 01:40:55,660
your mind makes it real.

1056
01:41:00,091 --> 01:41:01,298
What are you?

1057
01:41:02,677 --> 01:41:04,509
Why are you doing this to me?

1058
01:41:05,388 --> 01:41:06,924
Because your mind...

1059
01:41:07,890 --> 01:41:10,132
...is so inviting.

1060
01:42:01,152 --> 01:42:04,896
You can't escape your mind, Rose.

1061
01:42:12,288 --> 01:42:13,288
It's...

1062
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:17,283
It's my mind.

1063
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,416
You can't escape it either.

1064
01:42:42,068 --> 01:42:43,775
Rose!

1065
01:42:46,656 --> 01:42:48,192
Rose!

1066
01:44:11,824 --> 01:44:13,565
Holy shit.

1067
01:44:16,245 --> 01:44:17,827
Are you okay?

1068
01:44:17,913 --> 01:44:20,646
- Can I just come in for a sec?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1069
01:44:26,672 --> 01:44:28,004
Where have you been?

1070
01:44:32,636 --> 01:44:34,298
I'm sorry.

1071
01:44:36,182 --> 01:44:41,769
I'm sorry for dragging you into
my whole fucked-up mess.

1072
01:44:44,148 --> 01:44:45,889
For most of my life,

1073
01:44:45,983 --> 01:44:52,025
I've been afraid of
letting people get too close,

1074
01:44:53,157 --> 01:44:55,365
because I was afraid of...

1075
01:44:58,537 --> 01:45:01,200
what they might see if they really looked.

1076
01:45:01,290 --> 01:45:06,285
And so I... I put walls up,
and I kept people at a distance.

1077
01:45:09,256 --> 01:45:10,463
And then...

1078
01:45:14,053 --> 01:45:15,510
I met you,

1079
01:45:15,596 --> 01:45:19,465
and I could feel those walls coming down.

1080
01:45:19,558 --> 01:45:22,471
And it scared the shit out of me.

1081
01:45:25,523 --> 01:45:26,764
And so...

1082
01:45:28,067 --> 01:45:34,485
I was selfish,
and that was not fair to you.

1083
01:45:36,283 --> 01:45:39,651
And I am so, so sorry.

1084
01:45:41,288 --> 01:45:45,874
And I'm... I'm being selfish
again by even asking,

1085
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:47,292
but do you think that...

1086
01:45:47,378 --> 01:45:50,212
that I could stay here and just...

1087
01:45:52,633 --> 01:45:53,919
just sleep?

1088
01:45:57,221 --> 01:45:58,428
Could you...

1089
01:46:00,266 --> 01:46:02,849
stay with me while I sleep?

1090
01:46:06,564 --> 01:46:07,564
Please.

1091
01:46:09,275 --> 01:46:11,267
Yeah, of course I'll stay with you.

1092
01:46:19,493 --> 01:46:21,280
I'll stay with you forever.

1093
01:46:27,835 --> 01:46:28,916
No.

1094
01:46:36,093 --> 01:46:37,300
No.

1095
01:46:38,512 --> 01:46:39,673
No, no, no, no.

1096
01:46:40,764 --> 01:46:41,800
No, no.

1097
01:46:56,655 --> 01:46:57,655
No.

1098
01:47:22,824 --> 01:47:24,656
Rose.

1099
01:47:27,269 --> 01:47:29,761
No, no, no!

1100
01:47:37,655 --> 01:47:39,521
- Rose!
- No.

1101
01:47:39,615 --> 01:47:41,481
Rose, open the door!

1102
01:47:43,494 --> 01:47:46,407
Open the door.

1103
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:49,451
Rose!

1104
01:47:59,551 --> 01:48:02,259
No!

1105
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:06,264
- No!
- Fuck. Uh...

1106
01:48:06,350 --> 01:48:07,886
Hold on. I'm coming!

1107
01:48:07,977 --> 01:48:10,469
No!

1108
01:48:13,941 --> 01:48:15,148
Rose!

1109
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:20,358
No!

1110
01:49:01,947 --> 01:49:03,154
Rose.

1111
01:49:37,524 --> 01:49:38,640
Rose?

1112
01:49:45,032 --> 01:49:46,032
Rose?
