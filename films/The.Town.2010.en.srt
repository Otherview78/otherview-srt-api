1
00:01:45,294 --> 00:01:47,046
<i>Driver's name is Arthur Shea.</i>

2
00:01:47,588 --> 00:01:51,884
<i>Former Medford police officer,
57 years old.</i>

3
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:54,386
<i>Soon as his partner leaves with
the coal bag...</i>

4
00:01:54,553 --> 00:01:58,807
<i>...Artie cracks The Herald,
and he don't look up till the guy gets back.</i>

5
00:01:59,558 --> 00:02:02,895
<i>Marty MacGuire,
Cummins Armored courier.</i>

6
00:02:03,062 --> 00:02:06,815
<i>5'10", 220, 52 years old.</i>

7
00:02:06,982 --> 00:02:09,985
<i>Picks up every Wednesday and Friday
at exactly 8:12.</i>

8
00:02:10,152 --> 00:02:13,822
<i>Makes $110 a day. Carries a SIG 9.</i>

9
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:17,242
<i>And he's about to get robbed.</i>

10
00:02:17,993 --> 00:02:21,121
We're fucked if we see a helicopter,
we're fucked if we see SWAT.

11
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:24,833
We see a cruiser, stop, take out
the engine blocks, keep moving.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,251
No one needs to get hurt.

13
00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:28,379
Now, these guards
like to test you, though.

14
00:02:28,545 --> 00:02:31,465
They want to get hurt for $10 an hour,
don't get in the way.

15
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:34,885
Let's go.

16
00:02:58,075 --> 00:02:59,118
Move!

17
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:01,120
All right, now get away
from the counter!

18
00:03:01,286 --> 00:03:03,122
Go! Go! Go! Everybody away!

19
00:03:03,288 --> 00:03:04,581
Back against the wall.

20
00:03:04,957 --> 00:03:07,459
You! Away from the computer!

21
00:03:07,626 --> 00:03:10,504
- Give me the fucking key!
- Back up! Back! Go! Go!

22
00:03:10,671 --> 00:03:13,048
- Get up! Get up!
- Get the fucking door!

23
00:03:13,215 --> 00:03:14,258
Get on the ground!

24
00:03:14,425 --> 00:03:17,219
- Get down on the ground.
- Get your fucking ass on the ground!

25
00:03:17,386 --> 00:03:18,887
Move! Go, go, go, go!

26
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,143
- On the floor!
- I need everybody's BlackBerrys.

27
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:26,729
- Everybody on the floor.
- Slide your BlackBerrys up.

28
00:03:26,895 --> 00:03:28,313
Take off your fucking shoes!

29
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,775
BlackBerrys to the front!
Slide your fucking phones up.

30
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:34,194
- The fuck you looking at?
- Take your shoes off.

31
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:37,406
Get the cash drawers. Let's go.

32
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:40,409
- Take off your fucking shoes!
- Take off your shoes.

33
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:42,494
Bank manager, let's go.
Get up. Let's go.

34
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:44,455
Get up, come on, get up. Let's go.

35
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:47,958
Not you. You. Get up. Let's go.
Come on.

36
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:51,670
- You trying to be a hero?
- Jesus Christ!

37
00:03:51,837 --> 00:03:53,964
- When's the time lock set for?
- 9:00.

38
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:55,841
Don't lie to us, it's 8:15.

39
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:59,136
Listen, it's not your money.
You understand? Don't lie to us again.

40
00:03:59,303 --> 00:04:02,639
Hey, sweetheart, in the corner.
Get in the corner. You too, brother-man.

41
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:17,446
Go. Go.

42
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:24,036
No distress call. Open it clean.

43
00:04:25,954 --> 00:04:28,373
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Don't stall.

44
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:31,043
This guy a fucking friend of yours?

45
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:36,757
Let's go!

46
00:04:36,924 --> 00:04:39,468
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

47
00:04:41,929 --> 00:04:43,972
Take your time, okay?

48
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,642
Breathe. Go.

49
00:05:01,824 --> 00:05:03,742
Okay, get back. Get out of the way.

50
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:37,609
Front door.

51
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:40,571
- Hello.
- Front door.

52
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:43,448
Hey, you guys open?

53
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:02,551
We gotta go.

54
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:06,138
Let's go. Let's bleach it up.

55
00:06:06,305 --> 00:06:08,849
- Go, go, go.
- Let's bleach it up.

56
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:13,478
- Come on, let's go. We gotta go.
- Hold it. Silent alarm, this address.

57
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:16,565
- Who did it?
- Look, nobody did anything.

58
00:06:17,274 --> 00:06:20,235
- What? Huh? What'd you say?
- Nobody did anything.

59
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:22,654
- You pull the alarm?
- No. No.

60
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:24,573
- Did you?
- I didn't pull any alarm.

61
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,117
We were leaving,
you motherfucker! You fuck!

62
00:06:29,953 --> 00:06:31,830
Easy, easy. That's enough.

63
00:06:33,832 --> 00:06:36,084
- All right? Easy.
- You fuck!

64
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:38,712
You fucker. We were out the door,
you fuck.

65
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,172
Let's go.

66
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:52,017
Where's your purse?

67
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:02,194
What the fuck is this?

68
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:04,863
The cops get us walled in,
we're gonna need her.

69
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,949
Sit down. Go.

70
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,044
Head for the boulevard.

71
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,513
You're gonna be okay.

72
00:07:30,263 --> 00:07:32,140
All right? No one's gonna hurt you.

73
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,918
What's up?

74
00:08:00,085 --> 00:08:04,715
Boosted a city work van.
Which still hasn't been reported stolen.

75
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:06,717
Probably too busy working.

76
00:08:06,883 --> 00:08:09,094
Used the van to screen the door.

77
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:11,346
Bleached the entire place for DNA.

78
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:13,974
Kills all the clothing fiber,
so we can't get a match.

79
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:16,601
Silent bell
came from cage number two.

80
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:18,770
Assistant manager's at Beth Israel.

81
00:08:18,937 --> 00:08:21,606
Our guys waited for the time lock
to expire...

82
00:08:21,773 --> 00:08:24,276
...then they had the manager
open sesame.

83
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:26,737
Under duress?

84
00:08:27,112 --> 00:08:28,780
I don't know.

85
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:30,782
Ten foot steel safe.

86
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,494
Only as strong
as the guy with the key.

87
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:38,582
Found the dye packs and the tracers.

88
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:45,547
Found the van. Torched.

89
00:08:45,714 --> 00:08:48,050
-Where is it?
-Where do you think?

90
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:01,146
- Nice to be back home, Dino?
- Yeah.

91
00:09:01,897 --> 00:09:05,817
It's all the love I get
makes the homecoming feel so warm.

92
00:09:06,818 --> 00:09:10,572
Could be 50 people here
eyewitnessed these guys.

93
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:14,451
And 50 hands on a bible
saying they never saw nothing.

94
00:09:17,954 --> 00:09:20,123
Well, it's a pro job.

95
00:09:20,499 --> 00:09:23,502
All the pro guys I know are away...

96
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:26,838
...so I guess we got new pro guys.

97
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,926
The part of the job where
we get to do something...

98
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:35,013
...that has no point and yields no results.
Excuse me.

99
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:37,557
Anybody see who lit this van on fire?

100
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:52,405
Is that where we are now?

101
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:54,866
Where's Jem?

102
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:57,369
Stopped on the way
to light a couple house fires...

103
00:09:57,536 --> 00:10:00,163
...stick up a liquor store, maybe,
I don't know.

104
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,500
-Are we taking hostages now?
-No, we're not taking hostages now.

105
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:06,837
-You gonna talk to this fucking asshole?
-For one thing--

106
00:10:08,004 --> 00:10:09,131
Hey.

107
00:10:09,297 --> 00:10:11,007
Speak of the fucking devil.

108
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,552
You made it.

109
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:16,555
-Take the scenic route?
-We got a problem.

110
00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:18,723
-What?
-Well, look.

111
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,643
So what?

112
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,562
What's the matter?
Let me see that.

113
00:10:23,728 --> 00:10:25,564
- Fuck.
- Oh, shit.

114
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,275
- See the address on that?
- Bitch lives four blocks away.

115
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:30,694
Yeah, I know
where we are, Gloans. Fuck.

116
00:10:30,861 --> 00:10:33,071
We gonna see this bitch
on the street every day?

117
00:10:33,238 --> 00:10:34,406
She didn't see anything.

118
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:35,991
Jesus, are you sure?

119
00:10:36,158 --> 00:10:38,243
-Taking her for a ride didn't help.
-Yeah.

120
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,121
Oh, fuck.
All right. I'm gonna handle it.

121
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:42,581
How you gonna handle this?

122
00:10:42,747 --> 00:10:45,417
I'm gonna stalk her
like a fucking A car, we'll find out.

123
00:10:45,584 --> 00:10:47,586
-Find out what?
-If she needs to get scared.

124
00:10:47,752 --> 00:10:50,422
-She's already scared.
-Well, maybe not scared enough.

125
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:57,429
Thanks, Kathy.

126
00:10:58,263 --> 00:11:03,268
Ms. Keesey. Special Agent Adam Frawley,
Violent Crimes and Robbery.

127
00:11:03,435 --> 00:11:06,438
Derek here is gonna take some
elimination prints.

128
00:11:07,063 --> 00:11:09,316
I see you've given
a preliminary statement.

129
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:11,610
I want to talk to you
about your abduction.

130
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:12,903
Okay.

131
00:11:14,112 --> 00:11:16,740
-I understand they threatened you.
-Mm-hm.

132
00:11:17,282 --> 00:11:19,492
One of them took my license.

133
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:22,120
And did you try to escape
at any point?

134
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:24,164
No.

135
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:28,877
Is there anything you can identify
about the men? Anything you'd testify to?

136
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:31,504
I didn't try to escape
because they had guns.

137
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:33,256
I understand.

138
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:36,927
Then they just let you go?

139
00:11:37,093 --> 00:11:39,638
- Yeah. They just let me go.
- Thanks.

140
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,895
When someone endures
an experience like this...

141
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:49,814
...there are very often
residual effects.

142
00:11:50,523 --> 00:11:52,317
It's gonna be okay.

143
00:11:53,193 --> 00:11:54,986
Did they say anything?

144
00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:59,658
"If you talk to the FBI, we'll come
to your house and fuck you and kill you."

145
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:01,451
Are you gonna take care of it?

146
00:12:02,327 --> 00:12:04,663
-I'll do it.
-Why are you gonna do it?

147
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:06,831
You're the reason
we're having this conversation.

148
00:12:06,998 --> 00:12:09,668
-I'm gonna get it done.
-What are you gonna get done? Huh?

149
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:12,087
You get picked up
for intimidating a witness.

150
00:12:12,254 --> 00:12:14,798
You walk within 100 feet of her,
that's 10 years. Okay?

151
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:19,010
You got two strikes against you already.
They're gonna bury you under the jail.

152
00:12:20,595 --> 00:12:22,264
How much money's in the sack?

153
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,224
All right, we got 90 a pop.

154
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:26,685
Minus what I had to shave off
for the Florist.

155
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:29,312
Hey, Jem, what happened
with the assistant manager?

156
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:33,316
Yeah. Well, next time Skeletor comes
in the bank with an AK...

157
00:12:33,483 --> 00:12:36,695
...I think he's gonna think twice
about hitting that alarm, isn't he?

158
00:12:36,861 --> 00:12:38,905
He's lucky he just got tuned up.

159
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:41,366
Are you gonna catch them?

160
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:43,702
Yes.

161
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:46,496
This is the FBI.
We're not completely inept.

162
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,540
In fact...

163
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,376
...I know where they are.

164
00:12:52,168 --> 00:12:55,505
Three hundred and seventy
bank robberies in Boston last year.

165
00:12:55,672 --> 00:12:58,049
More per capita than
anywhere else in the world.

166
00:12:58,216 --> 00:13:02,554
The guys like this, hardcore guys, pros,
90 percent of them...

167
00:13:02,721 --> 00:13:06,182
...emanate from a one-square-mile
neighborhood called Charlestown.

168
00:13:06,349 --> 00:13:08,935
-Familiar with it?
-You must be kidding me.

169
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:12,731
First thing B.P.D. does
when there's an armored-car robbery?

170
00:13:12,897 --> 00:13:15,692
- Close the Charlestown Bridge.
- And he's from Charlestown.

171
00:13:15,859 --> 00:13:18,737
They use each other's yards, houses.
They're like rats.

172
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,405
They ditch us pretty quick.

173
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:22,866
Heisting banks is a trade in Charlestown.

174
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:27,037
The way villages in old Europe
used to be known for certain crafts.

175
00:13:27,203 --> 00:13:29,080
In the town,
it's banks and armored cars.

176
00:13:29,497 --> 00:13:33,752
I don't understand it, but it makes it easier
when you know which bridge to close.

177
00:13:33,918 --> 00:13:35,754
Quinlan will set you up with a detail.

178
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:40,091
Meantime, if there's anything your
witness specialist can't do for you...

179
00:13:41,176 --> 00:13:44,679
You got nothing to worry about.
We're gonna find these guys.

180
00:13:56,483 --> 00:13:58,443
- Hi, how you doing?
- Good. How are you?

181
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,862
- Good. Come in.
- Nice to see you.

182
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:02,739
-Good to see you.
-How have you been?

183
00:14:02,906 --> 00:14:06,493
-Good. Come in and have a seat.
-Thanks, Margie.

184
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:09,412
-Can I get you guys anything?
-We're fine. Thank you.

185
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:13,124
-Okay, well, Mike'll be right out.
-Terrific.

186
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,594
Really done well for himself.

187
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:26,388
Yeah.

188
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:31,351
He got good money
for that place in the town.

189
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:36,314
Why does anybody move to Saugus?

190
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,818
It's gonna take us an hour
to get over the Portagee Slide.

191
00:14:39,984 --> 00:14:41,528
Yep.

192
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:43,405
Jesus.

193
00:14:45,907 --> 00:14:48,326
This shit with the Florist
is getting old, man.

194
00:14:48,493 --> 00:14:50,495
I'm investing in a marquee score.

195
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:52,997
All right? So we gotta
make a few payments.

196
00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:55,041
Fuck making payments to him.

197
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:56,960
Hey, let me give you some advice.

198
00:14:57,127 --> 00:14:59,504
Money don't care where it came from,
all right?

199
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:02,173
The guy's a fucking
Lucky Charms Irishman...

200
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,676
...who can't find no one
to sell his AKs to...

201
00:15:04,843 --> 00:15:07,345
...so he's selling narcotics,
trying to be the boss.

202
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:10,515
You didn't seem to care
when you were dropping 2 grand a week...

203
00:15:10,682 --> 00:15:12,350
...on monsters and yay, did you?

204
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:16,855
Look, there's a difference between
a dealer and a straight killer, all right?

205
00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:20,275
So he dropped a few Dominicans.
What, are you picky?

206
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:22,152
Hey, guys.

207
00:15:22,318 --> 00:15:24,195
-Hey, Mike.
-Hey, Mike.

208
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:27,615
- Here you go, guys.
- Hey.

209
00:15:27,782 --> 00:15:28,908
Here you go.

210
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:30,368
-Hundred G's?
-That's right.

211
00:15:31,202 --> 00:15:32,370
Look at this.

212
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:35,123
-Like a newborn baby. All right.
-That's it.

213
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,876
-Take care, guys.
-All right. Good to see you, Mike.

214
00:15:38,042 --> 00:15:39,878
-Looking good.
-All right.

215
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:44,090
- Hundred pounds.
- Hundred grand.

216
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:46,342
There you go.

217
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:48,386
- Green money.
- All right.

218
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,390
-Be smart, brother. We'll see you.
-Thanks. Thank you.

219
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:01,649
-Hey, Rusty. How you doing?
-Hey, Jem. What's up? How are you?

220
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:03,485
Fergie. Kid's here.

221
00:16:06,237 --> 00:16:07,363
Hey, Fergie.

222
00:16:09,073 --> 00:16:10,700
-Here you go.
-How's it going, son?

223
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:14,245
All right. You run that under the sink,
all right?

224
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:16,498
Trust me.

225
00:16:22,587 --> 00:16:24,380
All right. Good to see you.

226
00:16:24,547 --> 00:16:26,758
Take it easy, man. Good to see you.

227
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:34,849
Now it's time for the fun part.

228
00:16:34,849 --> 00:17:04,849
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

229
00:17:35,326 --> 00:17:36,619
What's going on, pal?

230
00:17:36,786 --> 00:17:37,870
What up?

231
00:17:38,037 --> 00:17:39,372
Hey, there he is.

232
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:40,748
- Boom.
- Sober Jackson.

233
00:17:40,915 --> 00:17:42,875
- What's up?
- Hey, hey. Krista's here.

234
00:17:44,252 --> 00:17:45,587
Go on, tell the story.

235
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:49,173
Dougy, sit down. I'm trying to tell
these motherfuckers about your father.

236
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,176
The feds will never understand
the guy who's facing 40 years.

237
00:17:52,343 --> 00:17:55,847
Gonna give him the opportunity
to walk soot-free if he gives up his friends.

238
00:17:56,014 --> 00:17:58,099
He tells them,
"Suck a dick. Give me the 40."

239
00:17:58,266 --> 00:17:59,350
"Fucking suck a dick."

240
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:02,562
Yeah, well, here's to Big Mac.

241
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:04,731
Doing his time like a man.

242
00:18:04,897 --> 00:18:07,859
- That's right.
- Last crew in Charlestown.

243
00:18:08,026 --> 00:18:09,527
I'm gonna get a tonic, I guess.

244
00:18:09,694 --> 00:18:11,654
All right.
Get me an umbrella for my beer.

245
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:15,283
Let me get a Shirley Temple
with an extra cherry, please.

246
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:18,620
Poor fucking sober bastard.

247
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:24,542
- Thanks.
- No problem.

248
00:18:29,714 --> 00:18:31,090
Juice?

249
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:33,509
Yeah. Juice.

250
00:18:34,052 --> 00:18:35,970
Do you want some snappers
to go with that?

251
00:18:36,137 --> 00:18:38,765
-What are you doing?
-I was just playing.

252
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:40,725
Fuck.

253
00:18:41,684 --> 00:18:43,728
My drink.

254
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,069
Heard you got in a fight, Kris.

255
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:53,905
Do I look like I got in a fight?

256
00:18:54,572 --> 00:18:57,200
I don't know. Let me see.
They pull your hoop out?

257
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:58,409
That's right.

258
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:01,454
The Jamaican started it.

259
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,998
"The Jamaican started it."
What Jamaican?

260
00:19:04,165 --> 00:19:07,251
Fucking Somalian started talking shit
when I was with my daughter.

261
00:19:08,044 --> 00:19:09,879
You were with Shyne?

262
00:19:10,672 --> 00:19:14,258
Tonya was with us. And Cheryl too.

263
00:19:14,425 --> 00:19:17,261
-The other girl was by herself?
-Yeah.

264
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:19,555
All they see are yuppies down here.

265
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:22,684
They think there's no more serious
white people in Charlestown.

266
00:19:22,892 --> 00:19:25,770
So they can fucking talk shit? No.

267
00:19:25,937 --> 00:19:27,939
You didn't say nothing to her first?

268
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,442
I said something
after I slapped the black off her face.

269
00:19:31,984 --> 00:19:34,237
-Right, yeah.
-Fuck.

270
00:19:36,114 --> 00:19:37,907
Well, do you miss it?

271
00:19:38,074 --> 00:19:40,743
Fucking coke and Oxy
and all that shit? Yeah, I miss it.

272
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:42,829
You know what I miss?

273
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:47,166
The fucking grip I used to get
on your armrest.

274
00:19:49,335 --> 00:19:52,380
We smoked it to the filter, right?

275
00:19:52,797 --> 00:19:54,465
- So have one beer.
- Jimmy.

276
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:58,094
-One beer ain't gonna kill you, right?
-Drink my beer for me real quick.

277
00:19:58,261 --> 00:20:00,179
- And one for me.
- One for you? Yeah.

278
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:13,151
Dougy.

279
00:20:17,405 --> 00:20:19,073
Dougy-

280
00:20:19,657 --> 00:20:21,200
Doug.

281
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:25,329
Motherfucker, I know you can hear me.

282
00:20:25,663 --> 00:20:28,291
You know I got a key, Dougy.

283
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:38,259
Come on in.

284
00:20:38,426 --> 00:20:41,179
Too fucking busy, huh?

285
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:50,062
Come on, Dougy.

286
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:52,690
What's up, Kris?

287
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:14,796
There you go.

288
00:21:14,962 --> 00:21:16,589
There you go.

289
00:21:17,423 --> 00:21:19,133
That's what you want, right?

290
00:21:19,634 --> 00:21:22,386
-Yeah.
-Is that what you want?

291
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:25,556
Say you love it.

292
00:21:33,397 --> 00:21:35,399
Good night.

293
00:21:59,924 --> 00:22:01,425
<i>I'm grateful to be here today.</i>

294
00:22:01,634 --> 00:22:04,303
<i>I started out with alcohol,
and, you know, right away...</i>

295
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:08,307
<i>...went to cocaine and smoking crack.</i>

296
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:12,270
<i>Growing up in Charlestown in,
you know, a small-knit community...</i>

297
00:22:12,436 --> 00:22:14,522
<i>...we took care of each other.
We were protected.</i>

298
00:22:14,689 --> 00:22:16,607
<i>My friends were really
like my family.</i>

299
00:22:16,774 --> 00:22:18,985
<i>I'm ashamed of the things I done
when I'm out there.</i>

300
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:21,279
<i>I don't know
where I learned these things.</i>

301
00:22:21,445 --> 00:22:24,615
<i>Seven years went by,
and I'd watch Christmas, birthdays--</i>

302
00:22:24,782 --> 00:22:26,534
<i>I didn't know what my son looked like.</i>

303
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:28,703
<i>Make a fast buck if we had to...</i>

304
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:33,207
<i>...that progressed
into getting arrested, and...</i>

305
00:22:33,374 --> 00:22:37,086
<i>The struggle that you have within yourself,
the loss, you know what I mean?</i>

306
00:22:37,253 --> 00:22:41,299
<i>The disappointment in yourself. The anger
that turns into disappointment. The despair.</i>

307
00:22:41,465 --> 00:22:44,302
It's like the guy sitting in the bar,
and a priest walks in.

308
00:22:44,468 --> 00:22:46,012
The guy says, "Hey, wait a minute.

309
00:22:46,178 --> 00:22:50,391
I hate to tell you this, don't waste your
time, but I happen to know there's no God."

310
00:22:50,558 --> 00:22:52,226
The priest says, "Yeah, how's that?"

311
00:22:52,393 --> 00:22:55,730
The guy says,
"I was an explorer in the North Pole.

312
00:22:55,897 --> 00:22:59,317
I got caught in a blinding storm once.
Freezing. I was blinded.

313
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:03,112
Freezing to death. And I prayed,
'If there's a God, save me now.'

314
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:04,780
Now, God didn't come."

315
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:08,659
And the priest says, you know, "How's
that? You're alive. He must've saved you."

316
00:23:08,826 --> 00:23:10,328
He says, "God never showed up.

317
00:23:10,494 --> 00:23:14,498
An Eskimo came along.
Took me back to his camp and saved me."

318
00:23:14,665 --> 00:23:17,710
That's Janice. She's my wife
and she's sitting right there.

319
00:23:18,502 --> 00:23:20,796
She's my Eskimo.

320
00:24:08,344 --> 00:24:10,054
- How you doing?
- Hey.

321
00:24:44,922 --> 00:24:45,923
Excuse me?

322
00:24:46,674 --> 00:24:48,342
Are you doing laundry?

323
00:24:49,552 --> 00:24:50,970
Huh?

324
00:24:51,262 --> 00:24:53,931
I just wondered if you had any change.
The machine is out.

325
00:24:55,725 --> 00:24:57,893
-Can't help you. Sorry.
-Okay.

326
00:24:59,603 --> 00:25:01,772
I can just hang them up
when I get home.

327
00:25:31,886 --> 00:25:33,387
You all right'?

328
00:25:34,388 --> 00:25:36,223
I'm fine. I'm just--

329
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,017
Are you sure?

330
00:25:42,438 --> 00:25:43,481
You Okay?

331
00:25:44,065 --> 00:25:47,526
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, thank you.
I'm fine, yeah.

332
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:49,445
Well, this is embarrassing.

333
00:25:49,612 --> 00:25:52,073
No, you got nothing
to be embarrassed for.

334
00:25:53,866 --> 00:25:55,868
Do you need help?

335
00:25:56,452 --> 00:25:58,537
I'm just having a bad week.

336
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:02,500
I understand.

337
00:26:03,793 --> 00:26:06,045
I like to have a good cry
at the nail salon.

338
00:26:08,506 --> 00:26:12,718
Just open right up to the ladies.
They're very understanding.

339
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:16,013
But, you know,
you like the Laundromat, so that's fine.

340
00:26:22,645 --> 00:26:26,482
Hey, why don't you let me
buy you a drink.

341
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:29,110
Make up for letting you down
with the quarters.

342
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:31,862
You know, see if we can turn
your week around.

343
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,698
What's the worst that could happen?

344
00:26:34,865 --> 00:26:36,158
<i>FBI! Open the door!</i>

345
00:26:36,492 --> 00:26:37,743
Open the door!

346
00:26:40,371 --> 00:26:41,705
Fuck.

347
00:26:47,878 --> 00:26:49,046
Fuck.

348
00:26:49,213 --> 00:26:51,215
Fucking cocksucker. Get off him.

349
00:27:04,562 --> 00:27:05,896
Jesus Christ, Henry.

350
00:27:06,647 --> 00:27:08,774
Oxy, guns?

351
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:11,193
It's like townie Christmas.

352
00:27:14,155 --> 00:27:17,783
Minimum federal sentencing,
10 years.

353
00:27:20,578 --> 00:27:21,829
You're gonna need a friend.

354
00:27:23,914 --> 00:27:25,749
And she ain't it.

355
00:27:26,876 --> 00:27:30,421
Great girl, though.
She really loves you, I can tell.

356
00:27:31,338 --> 00:27:34,550
Good news for you is you have an alibi
for the Cambridge job.

357
00:27:34,717 --> 00:27:38,470
The good news for me
is I bet you know something about it.

358
00:27:39,722 --> 00:27:41,932
Everyone does trucks.

359
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,852
These guys beat the alarm
for the vault.

360
00:27:45,352 --> 00:27:47,062
- Yeah?
- It's what I heard.

361
00:27:47,229 --> 00:27:50,941
A kid, he gets into the junction box.

362
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,952
- This is nice.
- Yeah, it's a good place.

363
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:05,456
A guy I played hockey with for a long time
is one of the managers here.

364
00:28:05,623 --> 00:28:08,459
Oh, yeah? That's nice.

365
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,170
So, what do you do for work?

366
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,423
Boston Sand and Gravel.

367
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:17,593
I break rocks.
Punch a ticket at the end of the day...

368
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,638
...slide down the back of a brontosaurus
like Fred Flintstone.

369
00:28:20,804 --> 00:28:21,889
Call it a night.

370
00:28:23,224 --> 00:28:25,142
-Can I ask you something?
-You sure can.

371
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:27,770
I volunteer at the Boys & Girls Club
in Charlestown-

372
00:28:27,937 --> 00:28:29,104
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

373
00:28:29,271 --> 00:28:33,192
As a kickball pitcher since they haven't
been able to afford any ice for the rink.

374
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:36,028
Embarrassing. City won't put
any money into that place.

375
00:28:36,195 --> 00:28:39,990
Yeah, I know. Yeah, well, some of the kids
were calling me a toonie.

376
00:28:40,532 --> 00:28:44,161
It just means a yuppie. Someone who's
not from Charlestown, that's all.

377
00:28:44,328 --> 00:28:47,498
-Of course it does.
-They're just being punks.

378
00:28:47,665 --> 00:28:48,707
-A yuppie.
-Yeah.

379
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:52,211
-So where does the word come from?
-Uh...

380
00:28:52,503 --> 00:28:54,380
It comes from back in the '90s, like...

381
00:28:54,546 --> 00:28:57,132
...the toonies supplied all the tunes
to Charlestown...

382
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:01,178
...because once they moved in
the townies stole all their car stereos.

383
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:03,722
So all of a sudden,
everyone in Charlestown...

384
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:07,184
...had a Blaupunkt in their car,
you know what I mean?

385
00:29:07,851 --> 00:29:08,894
Anyway-

386
00:29:10,354 --> 00:29:12,481
So do your parents still live
in Charlestown?

387
00:29:12,856 --> 00:29:15,484
No. My mother moved away.

388
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:19,530
My father lives out in the suburbs.

389
00:29:21,282 --> 00:29:23,534
Yeah. He don't get out much.

390
00:29:24,118 --> 00:29:27,079
- No, I mean where did you grow up?
- Marblehead.

391
00:29:28,205 --> 00:29:30,040
Marblehead?

392
00:29:30,374 --> 00:29:31,542
Wow.

393
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:34,128
Yeah, well,
I represent Marblehead's poor.

394
00:29:34,295 --> 00:29:36,672
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, you were defined by...

395
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:41,885
...whether or not your family owned a boat.
And, well, my family didn't own a boat.

396
00:29:42,052 --> 00:29:45,639
No boat. How could you
look yourself in the mirror?

397
00:29:45,806 --> 00:29:47,474
It's embarrassing.

398
00:29:49,393 --> 00:29:50,644
-I have a boat.
-Oh, yeah?

399
00:29:50,811 --> 00:29:53,397
-Yeah.
-Well, you would do well in Marblehead.

400
00:29:53,564 --> 00:29:57,234
Yeah, maybe. It's not my boat,
it's my friend's boat.

401
00:29:57,943 --> 00:29:59,611
You should...

402
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:02,364
...let me take you for a ride sometime.

403
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:06,827
-I'd love that. Sometime.
-Yeah.

404
00:30:06,994 --> 00:30:10,497
What about right now?

405
00:30:20,924 --> 00:30:24,511
That's the boat. Right there.

406
00:30:27,056 --> 00:30:28,557
Wow.

407
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:32,436
- Not bad, right?
- Good friends to have.

408
00:30:52,456 --> 00:30:55,334
Here you go.
It's the best cup I could find.

409
00:30:56,585 --> 00:30:58,337
Not too much.

410
00:30:58,504 --> 00:31:00,172
Thank you.

411
00:31:03,008 --> 00:31:05,803
It's nice, right? I told you.

412
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:08,305
Is this where you take all the girls?

413
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,477
I can honestly tell you I have never taken
another girl here in my entire life.

414
00:31:13,644 --> 00:31:16,230
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hm. That's the truth.

415
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,820
Hey, what do you know about
bank robbers?

416
00:31:26,323 --> 00:31:28,826
-What's to know?
-You're from Charlestown.

417
00:31:28,992 --> 00:31:31,078
I figured you grew up with some of them.

418
00:31:31,537 --> 00:31:33,872
No, not really. I mean...

419
00:31:34,248 --> 00:31:37,668
A lot of what they say is exaggerated.
I mean, I--

420
00:31:39,503 --> 00:31:41,463
When I was a kid, uh...

421
00:31:42,923 --> 00:31:45,426
...we used to go to Wizard's ice cream.

422
00:31:45,592 --> 00:31:47,845
It was across from J.J.'s Bar.

423
00:31:48,011 --> 00:31:50,806
That was where all the big
armored-car guys hung out.

424
00:31:50,973 --> 00:31:54,309
And they were like rock stars
in the neighborhood, you know?

425
00:31:54,476 --> 00:31:57,646
Fancy cars. Pretty girls.

426
00:31:57,813 --> 00:32:03,402
And you heard rumors
about the jobs they pulled.

427
00:32:03,569 --> 00:32:07,865
The big houses they had
in Holbrook or Winthrop.

428
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:11,910
There was a lot of kids
in the ice-cream shop...

429
00:32:12,077 --> 00:32:15,664
...with their noses pressed
against the glass, you know...

430
00:32:16,582 --> 00:32:19,418
...who wanted to be like those guys.

431
00:32:22,212 --> 00:32:23,881
I just wanted to play hockey.

432
00:32:28,427 --> 00:32:31,513
Anyway, that's what I know
about bank robbers.

433
00:32:37,227 --> 00:32:41,148
- Hey, Jem. How's it going?
- Hey, B. Can I have a beer? Thanks.

434
00:32:41,315 --> 00:32:42,399
- Oh, shit.
- What up?

435
00:32:42,566 --> 00:32:46,028
-How you doing?
-All right. Sox got rocked.

436
00:32:48,655 --> 00:32:50,240
What's going on?

437
00:32:53,744 --> 00:32:55,787
You, uh, check on that thing?

438
00:32:55,954 --> 00:32:57,080
What?

439
00:32:57,247 --> 00:32:59,374
The license.

440
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:03,378
-Yeah.
-And?

441
00:33:03,545 --> 00:33:06,590
Nothing. It's a dead end. We're all set.

442
00:33:07,382 --> 00:33:10,010
So no need to remove her
from the equation?

443
00:33:10,594 --> 00:33:13,597
-What?
-You heard me.

444
00:33:14,014 --> 00:33:16,808
What are you, a triggerman now?

445
00:33:17,226 --> 00:33:19,102
Just loose ends, kid.

446
00:33:20,687 --> 00:33:24,274
You're gonna get the fucking electric
chair brought back over to Charlestown.

447
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:26,777
Don't be so goddamned panicked,
all right, Dig Dug?

448
00:33:26,944 --> 00:33:30,113
Just, you know, I don't wanna get
backdoored, that's all.

449
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,158
-We're fine. All right?
-All right. We're fine.

450
00:33:33,325 --> 00:33:35,619
-Okay.
-We're fine.

451
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:40,207
They obviously know
how to work the box.

452
00:33:40,374 --> 00:33:44,419
But I like the way they zapped the BPT
to the D-5 station.

453
00:33:44,586 --> 00:33:46,713
How does one learn how to do that?

454
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:49,925
Get a job at Vericom.

455
00:33:50,092 --> 00:33:52,719
-Okay.
-Thank you.

456
00:33:54,137 --> 00:33:56,598
All right, let's subpoena work logs,
employee records.

457
00:33:56,765 --> 00:33:58,767
Start with everybody
who lives in the town.

458
00:33:58,934 --> 00:34:00,352
Got it.

459
00:34:04,856 --> 00:34:08,527
Ms. Keesey, it's Agent Frawley.
I have follow-up questions about your case.

460
00:34:08,694 --> 00:34:10,779
Is there somewhere we can meet?

461
00:34:11,697 --> 00:34:14,283
Why didn't you tell me
you lived in Charlestown?

462
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:15,659
It's on my paperwork.

463
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:24,334
You don't like your sandwich?

464
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:29,172
It's the unfortunate nagging suspicion
you get as an FBI agent...

465
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:32,551
...who has put a lot of neighborhood
people in federal prison...

466
00:34:32,718 --> 00:34:36,388
...that someone may have
violated your meal.

467
00:34:36,555 --> 00:34:39,016
Come on, I don't think
anyone would do that.

468
00:34:39,182 --> 00:34:42,394
They throw Tom Fitz off the roof
of Mishawum for cooperating...

469
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:46,064
...and then stand around and taunt him
while he drowned in his own blood.

470
00:34:46,523 --> 00:34:49,026
So I don't think the lunch special
is out of bounds.

471
00:34:49,192 --> 00:34:51,153
Okay.

472
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:54,323
They lionize criminals...

473
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:56,533
...and complain about crime...

474
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,201
...and I'm the bad guy.

475
00:34:59,328 --> 00:35:02,831
This place is one square mile.

476
00:35:02,998 --> 00:35:06,460
You walk into Lewisburg,
there's a hundred townies in there.

477
00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:08,879
Well, I think I'll skip Lewisburg.

478
00:35:10,047 --> 00:35:12,257
Doesn't sound like a fun second date?

479
00:35:15,594 --> 00:35:18,013
If I ask a question,
will you give an honest answer?

480
00:35:18,513 --> 00:35:20,223
It depends on the question.

481
00:35:21,058 --> 00:35:22,643
Am I a suspect?

482
00:35:23,477 --> 00:35:25,896
Would I ask you out
if I thought you were a suspect?

483
00:35:26,063 --> 00:35:27,898
I don't know.

484
00:35:28,774 --> 00:35:31,068
-Would you?
-Not if I wanted a conviction.

485
00:35:37,658 --> 00:35:40,035
I might be seeing someone already.

486
00:35:44,081 --> 00:35:46,458
-What? What is it?
-Stickup.

487
00:35:47,084 --> 00:35:48,794
Chelsea Credit Union.

488
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,046
What would we do without Chelsea?

489
00:35:54,549 --> 00:35:56,343
Anyway, aren't there rules?

490
00:35:56,927 --> 00:35:59,096
Against dating the vic?
Yeah, there's a rule.

491
00:35:59,262 --> 00:36:00,931
You don't do it.

492
00:36:06,144 --> 00:36:08,355
- There she is.
- Hey.

493
00:36:08,522 --> 00:36:11,024
- All set?
- Yes.

494
00:36:13,735 --> 00:36:16,029
I should have come
get your door for you, huh?

495
00:36:16,196 --> 00:36:19,116
What kind of a guy lets you open
your own door like that?

496
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:22,703
What?

497
00:36:23,662 --> 00:36:25,539
I have to get something out there...

498
00:36:25,706 --> 00:36:29,167
...otherwise I'll be pretending
to listen to you all night...

499
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:31,837
...when really I'm thinking about
something else.

500
00:36:33,255 --> 00:36:34,297
Okay.

501
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,469
A few days ago my bank was robbed.

502
00:36:39,636 --> 00:36:43,181
Four men took it over
and opened the safe.

503
00:36:43,598 --> 00:36:46,643
They took me as a hostage.

504
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,064
They blindfolded me
and drove me around.

505
00:36:53,275 --> 00:36:56,361
And then they stopped and let me out
over at the beach and...

506
00:36:57,654 --> 00:37:01,032
And one of the guys told me...

507
00:37:01,283 --> 00:37:04,995
...to walk until I felt the water
on my toes.

508
00:37:06,413 --> 00:37:10,292
It was the longest walk of my life.
I kept thinking I'd step off a cliff.

509
00:37:14,588 --> 00:37:16,923
And then I felt the water.

510
00:37:19,801 --> 00:37:21,678
I'm sorry.

511
00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:24,598
It's not your fault.

512
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:30,687
Anyway, the FBI guy told me
it would feel like I was in mourning.

513
00:37:30,854 --> 00:37:33,982
FBI? You're working with the FBI?

514
00:37:34,149 --> 00:37:35,567
Mm-hm.

515
00:37:36,318 --> 00:37:38,236
What does that mean?

516
00:37:38,487 --> 00:37:41,740
Guy comes by, checks in on you,
gives you a call'? That kind of thing?

517
00:37:42,365 --> 00:37:43,909
Pretty much.

518
00:37:44,659 --> 00:37:48,288
They don't have any suspects?
Any clues? Any leads? Anything like that?

519
00:37:48,705 --> 00:37:51,041
I don't know.
Not that they've told me.

520
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:54,044
He intimated that they were
scouring Charlestown...

521
00:37:55,378 --> 00:37:58,715
...but they were wearing masks, so...

522
00:37:59,341 --> 00:38:01,718
-Shit.

523
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:06,515
I'm sure I'd recognize their voices
if I heard them again.

524
00:38:07,224 --> 00:38:10,894
I don't know,
might be harder than you think.

525
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,855
At least you weren't hurt.

526
00:38:15,899 --> 00:38:17,359
No.

527
00:38:17,943 --> 00:38:19,569
No, but David was.

528
00:38:19,736 --> 00:38:23,865
My assistant manager, he was assaulted
really badly when the alarm went off.

529
00:38:24,407 --> 00:38:26,660
He's been at Mass Eye and Ear
for a week.

530
00:38:26,827 --> 00:38:28,411
Eye surgery.

531
00:38:28,995 --> 00:38:31,665
And I still haven't been able
to go see him.

532
00:38:32,249 --> 00:38:34,835
I feel like a terrible person.

533
00:38:35,836 --> 00:38:39,172
Then I guess we know
where we're going.

534
00:38:53,061 --> 00:38:54,271
Well, you should come in.

535
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,315
-Yeah?
-Yeah, you should meet him.

536
00:38:57,816 --> 00:38:59,359
All right.

537
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:01,778
- Hi.
- Hello. Hi.

538
00:39:01,945 --> 00:39:04,823
Oh, hi. Come to my good side.

539
00:39:05,615 --> 00:39:07,576
- Hi.
- Look. You don't look so bad.

540
00:39:07,742 --> 00:39:09,494
- Really?
- Well, you know.

541
00:39:09,661 --> 00:39:10,954
- Hello.
- Hey.

542
00:39:11,121 --> 00:39:13,832
- This is my friend Doug.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

543
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:15,876
Nice to meet you. I can almost see you.

544
00:39:16,042 --> 00:39:17,377
So...

545
00:39:17,627 --> 00:39:18,795
...they're hopeful.

546
00:39:18,962 --> 00:39:21,631
Well, "hopeful" means I may recover...

547
00:39:21,798 --> 00:39:24,175
...50 percent of my sight in this eye.

548
00:39:24,634 --> 00:39:27,137
Oh, I just want to get back to work.

549
00:39:27,304 --> 00:39:30,473
I'm gonna give you guys some privacy.
I'll be right outside.

550
00:39:35,645 --> 00:39:37,898
- You heard what happened?
- Huh?

551
00:39:38,315 --> 00:39:40,567
Big takedown robbery.

552
00:39:40,817 --> 00:39:44,195
-Fucking punks laid the guy out.
-Oh, yeah?

553
00:39:46,323 --> 00:39:48,408
It's a good thing you're here.

554
00:39:49,284 --> 00:39:51,077
Those guys could come back.

555
00:39:51,745 --> 00:39:53,330
Yeah.

556
00:39:53,538 --> 00:39:55,957
<i>I lied to the FBI.</i>

557
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:57,709
What?

558
00:39:58,084 --> 00:39:59,586
When the guy attacked David...

559
00:39:59,753 --> 00:40:02,339
...I could see the back of his neck
and he had a tattoo.

560
00:40:04,674 --> 00:40:05,842
Of what?

561
00:40:06,301 --> 00:40:09,471
It was one of those
Fighting Irish tattoos.

562
00:40:09,638 --> 00:40:12,182
I'm afraid if I report it
they'll make me testify.

563
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:14,684
What do you think I should do?

564
00:40:18,188 --> 00:40:20,357
Tell the FBI.

565
00:40:20,857 --> 00:40:24,694
If the guy's got a record,
and I'm sure he does...

566
00:40:24,861 --> 00:40:27,489
...they'll have his tattoos on file.

567
00:40:27,781 --> 00:40:29,950
They'll ring him up the next day.

568
00:40:30,116 --> 00:40:33,119
Robbery, weapons. He'll get 30 years.

569
00:40:33,286 --> 00:40:36,831
Course, they'll worry someone's
gonna come looking for the witness.

570
00:40:37,123 --> 00:40:40,877
The FBI will probably want to put you in
WITSEC, you know, Witness Security.

571
00:40:41,044 --> 00:40:45,090
You know, they'll probably put you
somewhere, like, you know, in Cleveland...

572
00:40:45,256 --> 00:40:47,467
...or Arizona, you know,
somewhere safe.

573
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:51,137
Or...

574
00:40:51,471 --> 00:40:53,264
...you could wait.

575
00:40:55,225 --> 00:40:57,227
You have a card.

576
00:40:58,061 --> 00:41:00,397
There's nothing says you gotta play it
right away.

577
00:41:00,563 --> 00:41:03,692
You're the one who's vulnerable
in this situation right now.

578
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,695
The FBI are just people
like anyone else.

579
00:41:06,861 --> 00:41:09,864
They wanna find the bad guy so they
can go home and nuke their supper.

580
00:41:10,031 --> 00:41:13,076
You have to look out
for yourself, Claire.

581
00:41:15,078 --> 00:41:16,705
Quite an expert.

582
00:41:18,707 --> 00:41:20,250
Not really.

583
00:41:21,793 --> 00:41:23,086
Just watch a lot of TV.

584
00:41:24,004 --> 00:41:25,964
I watch a lot of CSI.

585
00:41:26,131 --> 00:41:29,134
So I'm a really big expert
on all this. I know.

586
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,721
And <i>Miami CSI</i> and <i>New York CSI.</i>

587
00:41:32,887 --> 00:41:34,764
All of them, I watch.

588
00:41:34,931 --> 00:41:36,266
You'll be well-prepared.

589
00:41:36,433 --> 00:41:37,809
And <i>Bones.</i>

590
00:41:41,187 --> 00:41:46,985
Do we know each other well enough for
me to say that this truck is a little much?

591
00:41:47,152 --> 00:41:48,278
It's my work truck.

592
00:41:48,445 --> 00:41:51,614
If you have problems with your Prius
I can throw it in the back.

593
00:41:51,781 --> 00:41:53,783
How did you know I had a Prius?

594
00:41:56,411 --> 00:41:59,789
Took a guess.
I mean, it just seemed like a toonie car.

595
00:41:59,956 --> 00:42:01,791
-Why, do you really have a Prius?
-Yeah.

596
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:04,335
-Really?
-I had a Prius.

597
00:42:04,502 --> 00:42:07,505
-It got vandalized, of course.
-What happened?

598
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:11,051
Doesn't matter. Now I'm forced to walk
a mile through the projects.

599
00:42:11,217 --> 00:42:14,596
-There were these guys and they started...
-What?

600
00:42:14,763 --> 00:42:17,640
I'm not sure if it was the same guys
who trashed my car, but--

601
00:42:17,807 --> 00:42:21,311
They started getting, you know--
It started with yelling when I walked by...

602
00:42:21,478 --> 00:42:23,688
...and then it got
really aggressive and...

603
00:42:23,855 --> 00:42:25,065
What were they doing?

604
00:42:25,231 --> 00:42:27,400
Once glass bottles
started getting thrown...

605
00:42:27,567 --> 00:42:31,488
...I started coming to terms with not being
cool enough to walk through the projects.

606
00:42:31,654 --> 00:42:33,490
They threw bottles at you?

607
00:42:33,656 --> 00:42:37,243
I'm fine. I just have to, you know,
go the long way.

608
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,579
That's all. It doesn't matter.

609
00:42:39,746 --> 00:42:42,290
No. You just have to live with it,
I guess.

610
00:42:43,249 --> 00:42:45,376
You remember what they look like?

611
00:42:50,757 --> 00:42:53,009
I need your help.
I can't tell you what it is...

612
00:42:53,176 --> 00:42:56,721
...you can never ask me about it later,
and we're gonna hurt some people.

613
00:42:58,848 --> 00:43:00,683
Whose car are we gonna take?

614
00:43:07,899 --> 00:43:09,359
Kenny with the white nose.

615
00:43:11,611 --> 00:43:13,905
- Hey, what's good, man?
- Hey.

616
00:43:14,072 --> 00:43:16,658
-How you doing?
-I hope you here to buy something.

617
00:43:16,825 --> 00:43:19,702
You roll up on a nigga,
"Kenny with the white nose" like that.

618
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:21,871
Well, we ain't here to play fucking Xbox.

619
00:43:22,038 --> 00:43:24,707
- Yeah.
- Wanna buy some dope, Kenny.

620
00:43:24,874 --> 00:43:26,835
-Cheap, shitty dope.
-Yeah? Okay.

621
00:43:27,001 --> 00:43:29,212
-He sells no other kind.
-Let me go find my box.

622
00:43:29,379 --> 00:43:31,756
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Appreciate it.

623
00:43:34,384 --> 00:43:35,927
Kenny.

624
00:43:37,387 --> 00:43:38,555
We're in Charlestown.

625
00:43:39,264 --> 00:43:43,059
Worst heroin problem on the East Coast.
Nigga Ken can't find his box.

626
00:43:44,144 --> 00:43:46,020
You ever buy from this clown before?

627
00:43:46,187 --> 00:43:49,858
I bought drugs from
electrician Marty with the white nose.

628
00:43:50,024 --> 00:43:51,067
All right.

629
00:43:53,361 --> 00:43:57,323
Yeah, here we go.
I got just what you need, brother.

630
00:43:57,824 --> 00:44:00,577
- All right, here.
- All right. Looks good to me, baby.

631
00:44:00,743 --> 00:44:02,412
- Thanks, partner.
- Yes, sir.

632
00:44:02,912 --> 00:44:04,581
Hey, um...

633
00:44:04,873 --> 00:44:08,459
...you know them Dominican kids
always starting trouble on Medford Street?

634
00:44:08,626 --> 00:44:09,878
Know what unit they're in'?

635
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:26,144
Townie credit card.

636
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,461
- Who is it?
- Open up.

637
00:44:56,591 --> 00:44:58,551
What the--?

638
00:45:08,895 --> 00:45:10,980
You drinking beers up here, huh? You--

639
00:45:18,112 --> 00:45:20,490
That hurts, right? Fucking piece of shit.

640
00:45:21,491 --> 00:45:22,951
Huh?

641
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:27,288
Throw with your left?

642
00:45:31,834 --> 00:45:33,586
- Fuck!
- Oh, shit, that hurts, huh?

643
00:45:33,753 --> 00:45:36,172
- What the fuck?
- That's a bitch, ain't it?

644
00:45:38,383 --> 00:45:42,679
Deal gone south for you motherfuckers.

645
00:45:42,845 --> 00:45:44,555
- Too bad.
- Who the fuck are you?

646
00:45:44,931 --> 00:45:49,185
Shouldn't be up here
fucking selling dope, I guess.

647
00:45:49,727 --> 00:45:52,230
Listen to me,
we're coming back in a week.

648
00:45:53,356 --> 00:45:55,650
- If you're fucking here then...
- Oh, shit.

649
00:45:55,817 --> 00:45:57,944
...this is happening again.

650
00:46:00,071 --> 00:46:02,115
Let's go, we're done.

651
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,285
Hey.

652
00:46:05,743 --> 00:46:08,538
-What'd you do?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

653
00:46:08,705 --> 00:46:10,665
That's my brother.
What'd you do to him?

654
00:46:10,832 --> 00:46:12,667
I don't know what you're talking about.

655
00:46:12,834 --> 00:46:15,044
- You don't know? How about now?
- No.

656
00:46:15,211 --> 00:46:17,505
Hey, chill, chill, chill, man. Chill.
Chill, man.

657
00:46:17,672 --> 00:46:19,048
Don't tell me to chill.

658
00:46:19,215 --> 00:46:20,842
- Enough. Let's go.
- What'd you do?

659
00:46:21,009 --> 00:46:22,885
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No?

660
00:46:24,554 --> 00:46:28,141
Soccer. There goes college soccer,
motherfucker.

661
00:46:28,308 --> 00:46:30,768
- Fuck!
- What'd you do?

662
00:46:30,935 --> 00:46:33,104
- No?
- I don't know. Aah!

663
00:46:34,063 --> 00:46:35,523
See my face?

664
00:46:35,982 --> 00:46:37,900
Go tell the cops, all right?

665
00:46:38,067 --> 00:46:41,070
But just remember, I seen yours too.

666
00:46:41,237 --> 00:46:43,072
Fuck.

667
00:46:54,542 --> 00:46:57,462
I can't be up there
killing people, man.

668
00:46:58,046 --> 00:47:00,089
Hey, you brought me.

669
00:47:10,558 --> 00:47:11,601
<i>Desmond Elden?</i>

670
00:47:11,768 --> 00:47:14,645
Yeah, works for Vericom.
Never seen the inside of a jail cell.

671
00:47:14,812 --> 00:47:17,482
Most of these guys got no-show jobs.
Take down a truck...

672
00:47:17,648 --> 00:47:21,194
...foreman goes, "Yeah, guy was here
yesterday." He shows us a forged timecard.

673
00:47:21,361 --> 00:47:24,280
Can't play them games at Vericom
because it's a public company.

674
00:47:24,447 --> 00:47:26,449
You don't show up,
it's a recorded sick day.

675
00:47:26,616 --> 00:47:29,243
And Dezzy here,
he's got some interesting sick days.

676
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:35,500
BankBoston, Cummins Armored,
Arlington Brinks, Cambridge Merchants.

677
00:47:42,006 --> 00:47:43,966
Jesus Christ.

678
00:47:47,178 --> 00:47:50,098
So do your parents
still live in Charlestown?

679
00:47:50,264 --> 00:47:54,644
No, my father finally
made it out to the suburbs.

680
00:47:55,103 --> 00:47:56,687
What about your mother?

681
00:47:57,146 --> 00:48:00,066
I couldn't tell you.
She left when I was 6.

682
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:04,821
What happened?

683
00:48:05,905 --> 00:48:07,740
She left.

684
00:48:14,288 --> 00:48:15,665
Okay.

685
00:48:24,006 --> 00:48:25,675
Okay.

686
00:48:27,009 --> 00:48:29,345
This sound woke me up.

687
00:48:31,472 --> 00:48:33,933
At first I didn't know what it was.

688
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:38,104
Sounded like an animal
that got trapped.

689
00:48:40,523 --> 00:48:43,359
I never heard a man cry before.

690
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:48,114
I came downstairs in my underwear.

691
00:48:49,282 --> 00:48:51,868
I see my father in the kitchen.

692
00:48:52,368 --> 00:48:54,620
First thing I remember was the ashtray.

693
00:48:54,787 --> 00:48:57,248
Must have been a hundred cigarettes
in there.

694
00:48:57,415 --> 00:48:59,917
Ash like a little mountain.

695
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,337
He stopped crying...

696
00:49:03,713 --> 00:49:07,091
...was just sitting there watching TV
on a little black-and-white.

697
00:49:07,258 --> 00:49:08,926
No sound.

698
00:49:11,262 --> 00:49:13,931
I think he just didn't know
what else to do.

699
00:49:16,684 --> 00:49:20,563
He looked at me standing there
in the doorway in my Underoos.

700
00:49:23,107 --> 00:49:27,236
He said, "Your mother left.
She's not coming back."

701
00:49:29,906 --> 00:49:31,741
Just like that.

702
00:49:33,409 --> 00:49:37,705
Smoking cigarettes and eating
a TV dinner at 6 in the morning.

703
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:44,253
We lost our dog the year before...

704
00:49:46,797 --> 00:49:49,509
...and I wanted to make these posters...

705
00:49:50,676 --> 00:49:53,387
...in case my mother was lost...

706
00:49:53,554 --> 00:49:55,389
...someone could call us...

707
00:49:55,556 --> 00:49:58,226
...like the guy who found our dog.

708
00:50:00,603 --> 00:50:04,357
To this day my father will tell you he helped
me make them posters, but he didn't.

709
00:50:04,524 --> 00:50:08,402
Sat in the kitchen, drank a case of beer
while I went out on School Street...

710
00:50:08,569 --> 00:50:11,280
...asking people
if they'd seen my mother.

711
00:50:11,822 --> 00:50:13,616
Her name was Doris.

712
00:50:13,783 --> 00:50:18,955
My grandmother had a place
that's a restaurant in Tangerine, Florida.

713
00:50:19,121 --> 00:50:21,999
So I used to imagine
maybe that's where she went.

714
00:50:23,209 --> 00:50:28,965
Then I came to terms with the fact
that doesn't really matter, you know?

715
00:50:29,215 --> 00:50:33,719
Wherever she went,
she had a good reason to leave here.

716
00:50:34,845 --> 00:50:37,682
She didn't wanna be
my mother anymore...

717
00:50:38,182 --> 00:50:42,353
...and she wasn't coming back.

718
00:50:44,939 --> 00:50:48,317
And now you know a little bit
about my family...

719
00:50:48,818 --> 00:50:51,195
...but I'm still not showing you
my apartment.

720
00:50:52,822 --> 00:50:55,157
How bad can it be?

721
00:51:05,501 --> 00:51:07,920
Oh, yeah.

722
00:51:23,185 --> 00:51:24,395
<i>Desmond Elden.</i>

723
00:51:24,562 --> 00:51:28,274
<i>Systems tech at Vericom,
22 years old.</i>

724
00:51:28,899 --> 00:51:32,194
Albert Magloan. Only in Boston
is a guy named Albert Magloan.

725
00:51:32,361 --> 00:51:35,698
Mr. Magloan never met a car
he couldn't boost.

726
00:51:36,115 --> 00:51:37,700
The kind of talented individual...

727
00:51:37,867 --> 00:51:41,621
<i>...that can start your Cherokee for you
while you're still looking for your keys.</i>

728
00:51:41,787 --> 00:51:45,916
James Coughlin. Father was killed
in prison, mother died of HIV.

729
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:49,587
<i>Shot Brendan Leahey by the cemetery
behind Mishawum when he was 18.</i>

730
00:51:49,754 --> 00:51:53,758
Pled it out. When the judge asked him why
he did it, he said, "I didn't like the kid."

731
00:51:53,924 --> 00:51:56,010
Served nine years for manslaughter.

732
00:51:56,177 --> 00:51:59,889
These guys plan and execute
with sophistication and discipline.

733
00:52:00,056 --> 00:52:02,558
And that is not our boy Coughlin.

734
00:52:02,975 --> 00:52:07,229
We think the architect is this guy,
Coughlin's best friend, Doug MacRay.

735
00:52:07,396 --> 00:52:09,732
Lives in the same house,
dated Coughlin's sister...

736
00:52:09,899 --> 00:52:14,445
...who most likely mules for the Florist,
who used to employ MacRay's father.

737
00:52:14,612 --> 00:52:16,989
You need a fucking Venn diagram
for these people.

738
00:52:17,907 --> 00:52:22,578
Mac Sr. got life for the Nashua job,
which most of you should remember.

739
00:52:22,745 --> 00:52:24,830
Hijacked a bread truck
up to New Hampshire...

740
00:52:24,997 --> 00:52:27,291
...one of the guards saw his face...

741
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:30,127
...so they executed both of them
with their own weapons.

742
00:52:30,294 --> 00:52:33,798
Big Mac's legacy is now no A car driver
is allowed to leave the cab...

743
00:52:33,964 --> 00:52:36,133
...even if there's a gun
to his partner's head.

744
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:39,428
MacRay did eight months
for going over the counter at a BayBank...

745
00:52:39,595 --> 00:52:41,597
...with a nail gun
after he washed out from pro hockey.

746
00:52:41,764 --> 00:52:44,433
- Pro hockey?
- Yeah, he was a big deal for a minute.

747
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,103
Got drafted, went to camp,
and here's the shocker:

748
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:49,313
Started making trouble,
fighting with guys.

749
00:52:49,814 --> 00:52:52,775
-Don't they pay you to fight in hockey?
-No, not the guys on your own team.

750
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:56,529
MacRay came home,
got into the family business.

751
00:52:56,904 --> 00:52:58,280
Same song, got into OxyContin.

752
00:52:58,781 --> 00:53:01,617
<i>Hockey ship sailed with the narcotics.</i>

753
00:53:01,784 --> 00:53:04,245
Now, we are a long way away
from a grand jury here.

754
00:53:04,412 --> 00:53:06,288
We'll never get 24-hour surveillance...

755
00:53:06,455 --> 00:53:09,041
...unless one of these idiots converts
to Islam.

756
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:11,043
So we build the case.

757
00:53:11,293 --> 00:53:13,713
All right, let's get to work.

758
00:53:15,089 --> 00:53:17,425
So I've been telling all my friends
about you.

759
00:53:17,591 --> 00:53:19,635
-Oh, yeah? All good, I hope.
-Yeah.

760
00:53:20,678 --> 00:53:22,138
Eh.

761
00:53:22,304 --> 00:53:26,475
Oh, yeah.
They say they're overcome with jealousy.

762
00:53:26,642 --> 00:53:29,019
They can't believe your luck.

763
00:53:29,186 --> 00:53:33,816
You moved to Charlestown,
hooked up with a rock-breaking townie.

764
00:53:35,443 --> 00:53:36,861
No.

765
00:53:38,112 --> 00:53:40,990
They just think it's a rebound.

766
00:53:41,282 --> 00:53:42,992
A rebound from what, the robbery?

767
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:44,660
I don't know.

768
00:53:44,827 --> 00:53:47,830
I feel estranged from them somehow.

769
00:53:49,915 --> 00:53:52,793
What? Why do you look like that?

770
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:58,382
-My brother died on a day like this.
-When was this?

771
00:53:59,049 --> 00:54:02,136
He was little. He had lymphoma.

772
00:54:03,971 --> 00:54:07,892
So now on really sunny days
I always think of someone dying.

773
00:54:09,935 --> 00:54:12,271
That's wrong, isn't it?

774
00:54:13,481 --> 00:54:14,857
No.

775
00:54:15,524 --> 00:54:18,027
I'm sure he'd be glad
you're thinking about him.

776
00:54:20,863 --> 00:54:22,448
This is a good day.

777
00:54:22,615 --> 00:54:24,700
I'm having a good time.

778
00:54:24,867 --> 00:54:26,368
Good.

779
00:54:26,952 --> 00:54:29,455
Then you'll miss me while I'm gone.

780
00:54:44,887 --> 00:54:46,806
Money, bitch.

781
00:54:49,141 --> 00:54:50,434
Pop.

782
00:54:51,435 --> 00:54:54,605
What the fuck you doing here? Huh?

783
00:54:54,772 --> 00:54:56,398
- Nothing.
- Nothing? What's this?

784
00:54:56,565 --> 00:54:58,192
-Who are you here with, huh?
-No one.

785
00:54:58,359 --> 00:55:00,986
- Let's get out of here.
- You're telling me this is yours?

786
00:55:01,153 --> 00:55:02,822
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Fucking Hawaiian pizza?

787
00:55:02,988 --> 00:55:04,573
-Sit down.
-Let's hit the road.

788
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:07,159
-I gotta go.
-Sit the fuck down. Just sit down.

789
00:55:19,296 --> 00:55:21,590
-Hi.
-Hi.

790
00:55:21,841 --> 00:55:23,759
-Hey.
-Claire.

791
00:55:23,926 --> 00:55:25,094
-I'm Jem.
-Jim?

792
00:55:25,261 --> 00:55:26,762
Jem. Jem. It's just Jem, yeah.

793
00:55:26,929 --> 00:55:28,764
I'm a friend of this loser right here.

794
00:55:28,931 --> 00:55:32,393
-Nice to meet you.
-Sit down, sit down, relax. All right?

795
00:55:40,067 --> 00:55:44,238
So I saw your fucking Avalanche
parked around the corner, so...

796
00:55:44,405 --> 00:55:45,531
The Avalanche?

797
00:55:45,698 --> 00:55:48,450
-Truck.
-Fucking truck. His work truck right there.

798
00:55:49,952 --> 00:55:52,454
-Dougy's quite the worker.
-Yeah.

799
00:55:52,621 --> 00:55:54,790
Have you two known each other
a long time or...?

800
00:55:54,957 --> 00:55:58,627
Since we were 6.
We're like brothers. Right?

801
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:01,630
But he's never mentioned a word
about you.

802
00:56:01,797 --> 00:56:04,466
The secrets with this one, you know, huh?

803
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:11,307
Did you say your name was Jim
or Jem?

804
00:56:11,473 --> 00:56:14,768
It's Ji-- Je--
Well, it's both, actually.

805
00:56:14,935 --> 00:56:17,521
Teachers, when we were growing up,
used to always say:

806
00:56:17,688 --> 00:56:20,149
"Hey, you can have this one.
He's a real gem."

807
00:56:20,774 --> 00:56:22,651
So I guess it kind of stuck.

808
00:56:24,111 --> 00:56:26,488
Whatever. I don't know.

809
00:56:26,655 --> 00:56:28,782
So, what do you do
for yourself there, Claire?

810
00:56:28,949 --> 00:56:30,826
Oh, I work at a bank.
I'm a bank manager.

811
00:56:30,993 --> 00:56:33,579
You're a bank manager?
Sounds fun. What bank?

812
00:56:34,288 --> 00:56:36,874
Cambridge Merchants. Just over there.

813
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:40,544
Cambridge Merchants. Wait, that's the one
that just got robbed, isn't it?

814
00:56:40,711 --> 00:56:42,463
It got robbed, yeah. It did, yeah.

815
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:46,050
I read about that. It's crazy.

816
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:48,218
So then how is it that you two met?

817
00:56:48,385 --> 00:56:49,511
Um...

818
00:56:50,304 --> 00:56:52,431
We met at a Laundromat.

819
00:56:53,557 --> 00:56:54,725
Okay.

820
00:56:54,892 --> 00:56:56,393
Love among the bleach, right?

821
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,354
Hey, it happens more than you think.

822
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,446
Hey, Claire, don't get too used
to your life of leisure here.

823
00:57:07,613 --> 00:57:10,741
Dougy here, he's a real workaholic,
you know.

824
00:57:10,908 --> 00:57:13,369
He's always taking his work home
with him.

825
00:57:13,535 --> 00:57:15,037
Aren't you?

826
00:57:17,539 --> 00:57:19,375
- All right.
- All right, brother.

827
00:57:20,167 --> 00:57:22,086
Take care of yourself, all right?
Be good.

828
00:57:22,252 --> 00:57:24,380
I'll see you at home.
It was nice to meet you.

829
00:57:24,546 --> 00:57:25,881
You too.

830
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,557
Well, I guess you haven't been telling
all your friends about me.

831
00:57:42,314 --> 00:57:45,025
Who you following, Jem?
Me or her?

832
00:57:45,192 --> 00:57:47,361
I told you, I made the Avalanche.

833
00:57:48,862 --> 00:57:51,073
Nothing to worry about.
It's all under control.

834
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,200
Oh, so you're trying to get us
jammed up?

835
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:55,577
-Is that it?
-I'm trying to get you jammed up.

836
00:57:56,412 --> 00:57:58,872
Tell me you got a move here, Dougy.

837
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:02,876
Because the only way I see it is you
got sprung like a goddamn bear trap...

838
00:58:03,043 --> 00:58:07,172
...on some toonie pussy who happens
to be the one goddamn person-- Fuck!

839
00:58:07,339 --> 00:58:10,467
The one person that can give us
to the fucking feds.

840
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:16,598
Calm down, all right?

841
00:58:16,849 --> 00:58:19,143
Don't you think we need to be smart
right now?

842
00:58:19,309 --> 00:58:21,353
-Smart?
-Yeah.

843
00:58:22,771 --> 00:58:25,065
Let's start fucking all the witnesses.
All right?

844
00:58:25,232 --> 00:58:29,445
Yeah, I'm blowing the assistant manager.
Am I smart now? Huh?

845
00:58:29,611 --> 00:58:33,866
And no, I didn't tell the other guys,
only because they'd flip the fuck out.

846
00:58:34,241 --> 00:58:36,493
And I want them fucking ready
for the next thing.

847
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,787
I told you, the next fucking thing's
not ready.

848
00:58:38,954 --> 00:58:40,122
Then make it ready.

849
00:58:40,289 --> 00:58:44,043
I don't like the guards
on the next thing, all right'?

850
00:58:44,209 --> 00:58:46,503
One kid is like fucking G.I. Joe.

851
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:50,966
He wears the vest on the outside, tucks
his pants into his fucking combat boots.

852
00:58:51,133 --> 00:58:52,885
The truck's fucking waist-high.

853
00:58:53,052 --> 00:58:55,804
We'll find another truck
with a driver...

854
00:58:55,971 --> 00:58:58,807
...who's a fucking fat kid
with his fucking shit untucked...

855
00:58:58,974 --> 00:59:02,061
-...who don't think he's Special Forces.
-Yeah?

856
00:59:02,227 --> 00:59:05,147
All right, look, I know you're
happy in Fuck City over there...

857
00:59:05,314 --> 00:59:08,067
...but I waited nine years in Walpole
for you, motherfucker.

858
00:59:08,233 --> 00:59:10,444
Just nine years, that's all.

859
00:59:11,862 --> 00:59:13,739
I'm done waiting.

860
00:59:15,407 --> 00:59:18,494
This is the last one.
We're hitting pause after this.

861
00:59:19,203 --> 00:59:22,122
You hate prison
but you can't wait to get caught.

862
00:59:22,289 --> 00:59:25,751
We get pinched,
remember whose idea this was, okay?

863
00:59:27,002 --> 00:59:28,879
Be ready on Friday.

864
00:59:43,894 --> 00:59:46,396
Visitors, straight ahead.

865
01:00:16,051 --> 01:00:19,346
-Who you seeing?
-Stephen MacRay.

866
01:00:36,071 --> 01:00:37,573
Twelve.

867
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:40,409
-Right down there.
-Thanks, Lenny.

868
01:01:01,013 --> 01:01:04,850
You all right? Every time I come up
here now it's the red pajamas.

869
01:01:05,017 --> 01:01:07,060
You still getting in trouble, Dad?

870
01:01:07,227 --> 01:01:11,273
Hey, you know how it is.
Can't take no shit.

871
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,151
You're getting a little old
for that bullshit, aren't you?

872
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:16,945
Fucking Southie kids.
They wanna run everything.

873
01:01:17,112 --> 01:01:20,616
Listen, you put a year together of
good behavior and get your points down...

874
01:01:20,782 --> 01:01:22,993
...you get classed out
over to Norfolk, Dad.

875
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:26,163
No one's gonna bother you there.
Nobody fights, you know?

876
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:29,124
They got fucking Ben & Jerry's
ice cream and shit.

877
01:01:29,291 --> 01:01:33,503
Well, some things you gotta deal with
yourself, you know?

878
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,551
All right.

879
01:01:46,016 --> 01:01:50,562
I'm thinking about taking a trip.

880
01:01:51,146 --> 01:01:53,899
-Going dark for a minute.
-Taking heat?

881
01:01:54,483 --> 01:01:57,110
Nah, just making a change.

882
01:01:57,277 --> 01:01:58,987
Yeah, don't tell me.

883
01:01:59,154 --> 01:02:00,489
"Making a change."

884
01:02:00,656 --> 01:02:03,283
Either you got heat or you don't.

885
01:02:04,576 --> 01:02:07,371
I heard a bread truck got dropped.

886
01:02:07,788 --> 01:02:09,998
Oh, yeah? I didn't hear about it.

887
01:02:10,415 --> 01:02:12,167
Okay.

888
01:02:12,459 --> 01:02:16,171
You got five minutes. Five minutes.

889
01:02:16,922 --> 01:02:18,840
Let me ask you something.

890
01:02:19,383 --> 01:02:21,009
In case I don't see you again.

891
01:02:24,554 --> 01:02:26,723
How come you never...?

892
01:02:27,891 --> 01:02:29,851
How come you never looked for her?

893
01:02:31,436 --> 01:02:33,563
Uh...

894
01:02:33,981 --> 01:02:35,649
Looked for who?

895
01:02:37,943 --> 01:02:39,528
For Ma.

896
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:43,115
For my mother.
How come you never looked for her?

897
01:02:43,282 --> 01:02:46,535
How come you never tried to call nobody
or look for her, or ask around?

898
01:02:46,702 --> 01:02:48,912
Look, when your mother left...

899
01:02:49,746 --> 01:02:54,376
...you cried so hard you were throwing up.
All over the parlor.

900
01:02:55,585 --> 01:02:58,797
So I told you if you looked around
you might find her.

901
01:02:58,964 --> 01:03:01,091
Just to give you an activity.

902
01:03:01,258 --> 01:03:04,511
I didn't think you'd carry it
like a fucking disease.

903
01:03:06,471 --> 01:03:09,224
What, you wanna think
she was an angel?

904
01:03:09,558 --> 01:03:11,268
Go ahead.

905
01:03:11,977 --> 01:03:14,313
But look out your front door.

906
01:03:14,479 --> 01:03:17,190
How many 22-year-old girls
are out there...

907
01:03:17,357 --> 01:03:21,778
...they're fucking around
with kids they don't want...

908
01:03:21,945 --> 01:03:26,241
...and, you know,
no sense in their heads.

909
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:30,245
And your mother wasn't no different.

910
01:03:30,412 --> 01:03:32,497
That's the hard truth.

911
01:03:33,498 --> 01:03:36,960
I made my peace with it.
You make yours.

912
01:03:37,461 --> 01:03:42,090
I didn't look for her
because there was nothing to find.

913
01:03:51,183 --> 01:03:55,103
Look, I gotta die five times
before I get out of here...

914
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:58,815
...but I'll see you again.

915
01:03:59,608 --> 01:04:01,860
This side or the other.

916
01:04:35,936 --> 01:04:37,396
<i>So I saw your picture yesterday.</i>

917
01:04:39,815 --> 01:04:43,151
-Are you sure it was me?
-Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

918
01:04:43,985 --> 01:04:47,239
-Oh, the Boys & Girls Club?
-Yeah.

919
01:04:47,406 --> 01:04:49,491
It was under a "local heroes" banner.

920
01:04:49,658 --> 01:04:53,036
Yeah. They got a real low standard
for who qualifies on that.

921
01:04:53,495 --> 01:04:55,038
Apparently you were drafted.

922
01:04:55,205 --> 01:05:00,877
Yeah. I was slow.
And I couldn't skate backwards.

923
01:05:01,169 --> 01:05:04,172
You're supposed to be able to skate
backwards in pro hockey.

924
01:05:04,339 --> 01:05:08,844
But I could shoot, you know?
I could hit anything with a hockey puck.

925
01:05:10,011 --> 01:05:14,599
But I got drafted and I just didn't do
what it took to make the team.

926
01:05:14,766 --> 01:05:19,396
And when I got a second chance,
I blew that too.

927
01:05:20,939 --> 01:05:24,192
They sent me home and that was it.

928
01:05:24,359 --> 01:05:26,778
I look at that picture
and I see a 20-year-old kid...

929
01:05:26,945 --> 01:05:29,698
...who thinks he's, you know,
got it all figured out.

930
01:05:30,991 --> 01:05:34,619
Right before he's about
to throw it all away.

931
01:05:45,672 --> 01:05:48,550
Hey, I don't wanna rush anything,
but can we go into your room?

932
01:05:48,717 --> 01:05:51,553
Because my uncle the bus driver
lives right across the way...

933
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,514
...and he can see
right into this apartment.

934
01:05:55,974 --> 01:05:58,351
-Yes.
-Okay.

935
01:06:34,429 --> 01:06:36,848
<i>They win the game
in overtime. Then you flip it over.</i>

936
01:06:37,015 --> 01:06:38,600
<i>Then you go back to Fenway Park.</i>

937
01:06:38,767 --> 01:06:41,520
<i>Then you get another great ending
to another...</i>

938
01:07:34,072 --> 01:07:36,157
<i>19, we walked through.</i>

939
01:07:36,324 --> 01:07:38,743
<i>Nothing appears disturbed.</i>

940
01:07:40,287 --> 01:07:42,122
<i>In this apartment anyway.</i>

941
01:07:42,289 --> 01:07:43,957
Where the fuck's the truck?

942
01:07:44,666 --> 01:07:47,002
<i>We shut and locked the door, but...</i>

943
01:07:47,168 --> 01:07:49,671
-What happened to 8:45?
-Late is what happened.

944
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:51,381
Fucking douche bag.

945
01:08:14,863 --> 01:08:17,407
Say your prayers. Here we go.

946
01:08:20,869 --> 01:08:22,412
Here we go.

947
01:08:40,555 --> 01:08:42,057
Gun!

948
01:08:43,433 --> 01:08:45,101
Don't move!

949
01:08:50,106 --> 01:08:52,067
- Go! Go!
- Get back! Get back!

950
01:08:52,233 --> 01:08:54,235
Get out of the way!

951
01:09:04,746 --> 01:09:06,581
<i>Any units in the area, 10-61 in progress.</i>

952
01:09:06,748 --> 01:09:08,083
The call went out!

953
01:09:09,167 --> 01:09:10,669
Fuck.

954
01:09:11,169 --> 01:09:13,588
Get out here, asshole,
I got your friend.

955
01:09:13,838 --> 01:09:16,883
Calm down. Put your gun away,
all right? You're gonna get hurt.

956
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:19,594
Put that fucking gun down now.
I got you, motherfucker.

957
01:09:21,012 --> 01:09:22,514
Jesus!

958
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:26,476
You should have stayed in the truck, cunt.

959
01:09:27,102 --> 01:09:28,103
Let's go!

960
01:09:30,188 --> 01:09:31,564
What the fuck just happened?

961
01:09:31,731 --> 01:09:35,193
- Goddamn it, I fucking told you.
- Fucking shut the fuck up, all right?

962
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:36,903
- Fucking knew it.
- Goddamn it!

963
01:09:37,862 --> 01:09:41,991
All right, drive. Just take it easy, all
right? Take it easy. Drive slow. Drive normal.

964
01:09:45,495 --> 01:09:46,788
- Shit.
- Ah, fuck.

965
01:09:48,123 --> 01:09:50,417
They must have been around the corner.

966
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,877
Driver, turn your engine off.

967
01:10:34,461 --> 01:10:36,713
Hands where I can see them.

968
01:10:37,922 --> 01:10:38,965
Fuck.

969
01:10:39,132 --> 01:10:42,343
Shut the engine off now.
Put your hands in the a--

970
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:52,520
Hit the engine block!

971
01:10:54,814 --> 01:10:56,149
Go, go, go, go, go!

972
01:11:19,464 --> 01:11:21,966
Go to the fucking switch!

973
01:11:30,517 --> 01:11:31,851
Fuck!

974
01:11:39,651 --> 01:11:41,444
How do you like that, motherfucker?

975
01:11:54,165 --> 01:11:55,625
Let's go, let's go!

976
01:11:55,792 --> 01:11:57,418
- It's Dez.
- Let's go, let's go!

977
01:11:57,585 --> 01:11:58,878
Drop it!

978
01:12:10,849 --> 01:12:12,392
Let's go!

979
01:12:30,285 --> 01:12:31,703
Dino.

980
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:33,162
What?

981
01:12:33,746 --> 01:12:34,831
Close the bridge.

982
01:12:35,915 --> 01:12:39,043
-What?
-Close the fucking bridge.

983
01:12:57,270 --> 01:12:59,814
<i>Alpha 101, Alpha 412, Alpha 407...</i>

984
01:12:59,981 --> 01:13:02,150
<i>...en route to the north end
of the bridge.</i>

985
01:13:02,317 --> 01:13:04,485
They're going for the bridge.

986
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:46,527
Now, that's how you drive
a fucking car.

987
01:14:02,543 --> 01:14:04,963
All the DNA in Charlestown.

988
01:14:30,613 --> 01:14:32,407
The fuck was that?

989
01:14:32,573 --> 01:14:35,618
He didn't wanna end up on the wall
at the VFW.

990
01:14:41,457 --> 01:14:43,084
<i>You print the inside of the van?</i>

991
01:14:43,251 --> 01:14:45,420
Frawl, the inside of the van
is a volcano.

992
01:14:45,586 --> 01:14:49,257
Just find something and make it look
like something that looks like a print.

993
01:14:50,299 --> 01:14:52,427
<i>We don't have enough
for a conviction. Fine.</i>

994
01:14:52,844 --> 01:14:54,595
<i>But I need to get them in a room.</i>

995
01:14:54,804 --> 01:14:58,141
Right now, they are burning the money
bands at some bullshit safe house.

996
01:14:58,307 --> 01:15:01,144
All their alibis were paid for
a week in advance.

997
01:15:01,602 --> 01:15:04,522
We're not gonna pull any DNA
off of this or off the switch car.

998
01:15:04,689 --> 01:15:08,026
And that, as they say, is that.

999
01:15:08,693 --> 01:15:12,613
This is the "not fucking around" crew.
Find me something that looks like a print...

1000
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:15,533
...so I can grab one of these assholes
and shake their tree.

1001
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:18,327
This "not fucking around" thing
is about to go both ways.

1002
01:15:40,475 --> 01:15:42,226
Turn around for me, will you?

1003
01:15:57,366 --> 01:15:59,994
-Mr. Coughlin.
-Lawyer.

1004
01:16:07,543 --> 01:16:11,339
-This is it? Just say what's here?
-Yeah, go ahead. Read what's on the paper.

1005
01:16:11,506 --> 01:16:12,757
All right.

1006
01:16:13,174 --> 01:16:17,136
"You aren't supposed to come out of
the truck. You got him but who got me?

1007
01:16:17,303 --> 01:16:19,972
Courier, you're gonna get hurt."

1008
01:16:21,557 --> 01:16:22,600
It's kind of short.

1009
01:16:22,767 --> 01:16:25,019
Go ahead, read what's on the page.

1010
01:16:25,645 --> 01:16:28,564
Right there? Um...

1011
01:16:29,732 --> 01:16:32,360
"You aren't supposed
to come out of the truck."

1012
01:16:32,527 --> 01:16:36,114
-Come on, come on.
-"You got him but who got me?"

1013
01:16:39,575 --> 01:16:43,329
"Come here, get on the ground,
before I pop your fucking teeth out!"

1014
01:16:45,206 --> 01:16:48,251
Come on, read it. Read it all.
There's about five things there.

1015
01:16:49,001 --> 01:16:50,878
Uh...

1016
01:16:51,629 --> 01:16:53,464
What is it with you guys
in Charlestown?

1017
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:56,676
Don't they teach you how to read?
There's things here. Read them.

1018
01:16:56,843 --> 01:16:59,095
I don't wanna read that.
This doesn't sound right.

1019
01:16:59,262 --> 01:17:02,431
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.
Read the pages, please.

1020
01:17:02,598 --> 01:17:04,767
I'm trying to make this
sound authenticious.

1021
01:17:04,934 --> 01:17:07,228
-You got it all fucked up.
-Authen-what?

1022
01:17:10,022 --> 01:17:11,524
Thanks.

1023
01:17:11,691 --> 01:17:14,485
- Hey, Dougy. How are you?
- Oh.

1024
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,947
How you doing?

1025
01:17:18,114 --> 01:17:20,074
Local crime fighter.

1026
01:17:20,324 --> 01:17:21,951
What's happening, Dino?

1027
01:17:23,035 --> 01:17:24,579
I know your father.

1028
01:17:26,372 --> 01:17:29,083
Yeah. Me too.

1029
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:31,335
Got a few years left on his bid.

1030
01:17:32,086 --> 01:17:34,005
Yeah, one or two.

1031
01:17:35,214 --> 01:17:37,550
I hear they got to the old guy.

1032
01:17:38,176 --> 01:17:39,844
Split him up the back.

1033
01:17:40,011 --> 01:17:41,262
Fucking animals.

1034
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:44,182
You'd think they'd go after
a younger kid.

1035
01:17:44,473 --> 01:17:47,476
I don't know.
Making a statement, I guess.

1036
01:17:47,852 --> 01:17:50,229
Townie crews ain't
what they used to be.

1037
01:17:51,647 --> 01:17:53,149
Dorchester...

1038
01:17:53,316 --> 01:17:54,609
...Southie...

1039
01:17:55,193 --> 01:17:57,153
...looking to make a move.

1040
01:17:58,279 --> 01:18:00,990
Maybe you can change all that
when you get up there.

1041
01:18:02,366 --> 01:18:05,286
Let me ask you a question.
What do you call a guy...

1042
01:18:05,453 --> 01:18:08,664
...who grows up with a group of people,
gets to know their secrets...

1043
01:18:08,831 --> 01:18:10,917
...because they trust him,
and then turns around...

1044
01:18:11,083 --> 01:18:14,837
...and use those secrets against them,
put those people in prison?

1045
01:18:15,463 --> 01:18:18,466
You'd call him a rat, right?
You know what I call him?

1046
01:18:18,633 --> 01:18:20,301
Dino the dago.

1047
01:18:20,468 --> 01:18:23,304
Those people made you
a part of that community.

1048
01:18:23,471 --> 01:18:25,306
What did they get for it?

1049
01:18:25,765 --> 01:18:28,017
Inside of the fucking can.

1050
01:18:29,477 --> 01:18:33,064
You know we lifted a print
off the van? Right?

1051
01:18:41,364 --> 01:18:43,491
Special Agent Frawley...

1052
01:18:43,824 --> 01:18:44,825
...Douglas MacRay.

1053
01:18:47,703 --> 01:18:49,372
You and your boys didn't just...

1054
01:18:50,206 --> 01:18:54,293
...roll a Star Market
over in Maiden for a box of quarters.

1055
01:18:54,669 --> 01:18:56,671
No, you decided to bang it out...

1056
01:18:56,837 --> 01:19:00,174
...in the North End at 9:00 in the morning.
With assault rifles.

1057
01:19:01,133 --> 01:19:04,470
You fucking dummies shot a guard.

1058
01:19:05,763 --> 01:19:09,558
Now you're like a half-off sale
at Big and Tall. Every cop is in line.

1059
01:19:09,725 --> 01:19:11,560
Fortunately, though, for you...

1060
01:19:11,727 --> 01:19:14,522
...this guard,
who is two-thirds to a retard...

1061
01:19:14,689 --> 01:19:16,274
...has miraculously clung to life.

1062
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:18,067
Now, if it were up to me...

1063
01:19:18,234 --> 01:19:20,987
...and they gave me two minutes
and a wet towel...

1064
01:19:21,362 --> 01:19:23,656
...I would personally asphyxiate
this half-wit...

1065
01:19:23,823 --> 01:19:26,033
...so we could string you up
on a federal M1...

1066
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,369
...and end this story
with a bag on your head...

1067
01:19:28,536 --> 01:19:31,372
...and a paralyzing agent
running through your veins.

1068
01:19:32,581 --> 01:19:35,918
This isn't fucking townie hopscotch
anymore, Doug.

1069
01:19:37,378 --> 01:19:38,754
But I did want to say one thing.

1070
01:19:39,213 --> 01:19:42,883
Just so we're both very, very clear.

1071
01:19:43,634 --> 01:19:45,970
Because in these situations,
sometimes, you know...

1072
01:19:46,304 --> 01:19:50,474
...various parties will bandy about
the possibility of sentence reduction...

1073
01:19:50,641 --> 01:19:54,895
...for cooperation
or otherwise assisting the--

1074
01:19:55,062 --> 01:19:57,398
Assisting the prosecution.

1075
01:19:59,775 --> 01:20:01,569
Not this time.

1076
01:20:03,237 --> 01:20:05,573
You're here today
so I could personally tell you...

1077
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:08,701
...that you are going to die
in federal prison.

1078
01:20:09,577 --> 01:20:11,746
And so are all your friends.

1079
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:13,664
No deal.

1080
01:20:14,081 --> 01:20:15,249
No compromise.

1081
01:20:16,584 --> 01:20:18,544
And when that day comes...

1082
01:20:18,711 --> 01:20:21,589
...when you start trying to be
my hero collaborator so hard...

1083
01:20:21,756 --> 01:20:24,759
...that I have to slap you to shut up--
And it will come...

1084
01:20:24,925 --> 01:20:30,765
...despite your pitiable,
misguided, Irish omerta.

1085
01:20:30,931 --> 01:20:34,435
--When your code of silence
finally gives way...

1086
01:20:34,602 --> 01:20:39,690
...to fear of trafficking in cigarettes
to prevent sexual enslavement...

1087
01:20:41,025 --> 01:20:45,863
...I just want you to know that it's gonna
be me who tells you to go fuck yourself.

1088
01:20:50,618 --> 01:20:54,997
Hey, next time you guys
wanna take pictures of me, just call ahead.

1089
01:20:55,164 --> 01:20:57,291
You know, we can do better
than a barbeque.

1090
01:20:57,458 --> 01:20:59,710
A calendar shoot. You know?

1091
01:20:59,877 --> 01:21:01,587
Maybe topless, lubed up.

1092
01:21:01,754 --> 01:21:03,631
Whatever you guys are into.

1093
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:07,134
FBI car antennas
are half-inch matte black...

1094
01:21:07,301 --> 01:21:10,012
...about three-quarters the way down
the rear windshield.

1095
01:21:10,179 --> 01:21:11,430
Statie are pigtailed...

1096
01:21:11,597 --> 01:21:13,349
...B.P.D., half and half.

1097
01:21:13,766 --> 01:21:17,812
Every peewee in the town knows
what an FBI rear antenna looks like.

1098
01:21:17,978 --> 01:21:21,607
So, in the future, if you guys
are gonna try to be slick...

1099
01:21:22,316 --> 01:21:24,360
...be slicker than a 6-year-old.

1100
01:21:25,111 --> 01:21:26,821
I gotta get back to work.

1101
01:21:27,154 --> 01:21:28,781
Can I go?

1102
01:21:32,368 --> 01:21:34,203
Good luck with that print.

1103
01:22:04,733 --> 01:22:06,318
<i>Good morning, Cambridge Savings.</i>

1104
01:22:06,485 --> 01:22:09,196
Claire Keesey, please.
She's the manager.

1105
01:22:09,363 --> 01:22:12,199
<i>Oh, she's no longer working here.</i>

1106
01:22:12,366 --> 01:22:13,868
-Since when?
-Friday.

1107
01:22:14,034 --> 01:22:17,913
Just get the warrant. Land, cell, e-mail,
fax, Skype. The whole fucking thing.

1108
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:27,298
- Oh, my God, Doug.
- Took me forever trying to pick it out.

1109
01:22:27,465 --> 01:22:30,384
- Yeah, it's beautiful.
- Is that all right?

1110
01:22:30,551 --> 01:22:34,138
Yeah, but I can't accept that from you.
I can't take that.

1111
01:22:34,305 --> 01:22:37,516
Why not? You can hawk it.
I'm not taking it back.

1112
01:22:37,683 --> 01:22:39,727
No. I mean, you can't--

1113
01:22:39,894 --> 01:22:42,605
Keep it. Come on, sit down. Sit down.

1114
01:22:42,771 --> 01:22:45,107
-Sit down.
-Okay.

1115
01:22:50,529 --> 01:22:51,864
Wow.

1116
01:22:54,366 --> 01:22:56,702
I quit my job today-

1117
01:22:56,869 --> 01:22:58,287
What?

1118
01:22:59,955 --> 01:23:01,665
What are you gonna do?

1119
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:09,298
Uh, I don't know. Volunteer full-time.
Maybe go back to teaching.

1120
01:23:09,465 --> 01:23:12,593
I have a little cushion.

1121
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:15,930
You know...

1122
01:23:16,388 --> 01:23:19,892
...people get up every day,
they do the same thing.

1123
01:23:20,059 --> 01:23:24,188
They tell themself they're gonna
change their life one day and they never do.

1124
01:23:24,897 --> 01:23:26,941
I'm gonna change mine.

1125
01:23:28,901 --> 01:23:30,819
Why don't you do it with me?

1126
01:23:31,445 --> 01:23:33,572
Go somewhere.

1127
01:23:33,739 --> 01:23:38,786
I got a little sofa put away.

1128
01:23:41,121 --> 01:23:42,790
Give it a shot.

1129
01:23:45,417 --> 01:23:47,169
Well, where would we go?

1130
01:23:48,128 --> 01:23:50,172
Wherever you want. I don't know.

1131
01:23:50,339 --> 01:23:51,799
See what we got there.

1132
01:23:53,092 --> 01:23:56,762
Doesn't have to be a big thing, you know?
I thought about going down to...

1133
01:23:56,929 --> 01:24:01,141
...see if my grandma's place is still there.
Tangerine, Florida.

1134
01:24:01,308 --> 01:24:03,644
But I'll go to any town
named after a food.

1135
01:24:03,811 --> 01:24:06,730
Grapefruit, Michigan.
Watermelon, New Mexico.

1136
01:24:06,897 --> 01:24:09,525
Just pick it on a map.

1137
01:24:13,195 --> 01:24:17,449
You ever read that paper <i>The Town?</i>

1138
01:24:17,992 --> 01:24:20,369
-The free paper? Yeah.
-Uh-huh.

1139
01:24:22,079 --> 01:24:26,041
I was clearing my foyer the other day...

1140
01:24:26,208 --> 01:24:30,671
...and there was a picture of the guys
who were harassing me in the bricks.

1141
01:24:31,839 --> 01:24:33,257
-Yeah?
-Mm-hm.

1142
01:24:33,424 --> 01:24:36,468
It was an article
about how one of them got shot.

1143
01:24:37,803 --> 01:24:40,055
-Say who did it?
-No.

1144
01:24:40,598 --> 01:24:43,309
Local gangsters, apparently.

1145
01:24:45,561 --> 01:24:49,106
I guess that's what you get
for being out on the street dealing drugs.

1146
01:24:49,898 --> 01:24:52,818
What makes you say
they were dealing drugs?

1147
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:57,948
I grew up out there, Claire.
Believe me, that kid was selling drugs.

1148
01:25:00,534 --> 01:25:02,244
What do you want me to say?

1149
01:25:02,578 --> 01:25:07,041
I feel bad the kid who was terrorizing you
ran into the wrong guys?

1150
01:25:07,708 --> 01:25:09,209
Believe me, I don't.

1151
01:25:10,169 --> 01:25:13,464
You know, I care about you.
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

1152
01:25:13,631 --> 01:25:15,633
You don't go after women.

1153
01:25:15,799 --> 01:25:18,761
He hurt you, someone hurt him.
Too bad. That's the way it goes.

1154
01:25:18,927 --> 01:25:21,055
You know? That's karma.

1155
01:25:24,183 --> 01:25:26,935
I don't think karma works like that.

1156
01:25:28,646 --> 01:25:33,233
Well, however it works,
it worked out bad for them kids, you know?

1157
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:37,404
And I'm not gonna shed a tear over it.

1158
01:25:38,864 --> 01:25:40,908
Let's go get some food, okay?

1159
01:25:45,579 --> 01:25:47,081
<i>Frawl.</i>

1160
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:50,751
What is it?

1161
01:25:50,918 --> 01:25:54,588
Phone conversation between Claire Keesey
and a burner cell about an hour ago.

1162
01:25:54,755 --> 01:25:57,341
See if you can recognize the voice.

1163
01:25:58,425 --> 01:26:00,761
<i>Hey, can I come over?
I want to talk to you.</i>

1164
01:26:00,928 --> 01:26:02,763
<i>Yeah. Where have you been?</i>

1165
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:04,598
<i>Sorry, I got held up.</i>

1166
01:26:04,765 --> 01:26:06,600
<i>I'm coming over from my place.</i>

1167
01:26:06,767 --> 01:26:08,727
<i>Will you come down the back
and let me in?</i>

1168
01:26:11,563 --> 01:26:13,774
<i>Hadn't realized you'd left
your job at the bank.</i>

1169
01:26:14,775 --> 01:26:18,487
Uh... Oh, yeah. Yeah. Last week.

1170
01:26:20,406 --> 01:26:22,741
I'm sorry,
was I supposed to notify someone?

1171
01:26:27,454 --> 01:26:29,123
Fancy.

1172
01:26:29,331 --> 01:26:30,916
Yeah. It was a gift.

1173
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:39,133
Look, I think maybe you should go.

1174
01:26:39,299 --> 01:26:41,343
We have our suspects.

1175
01:26:42,803 --> 01:26:45,347
I came by to share this with you.

1176
01:26:48,684 --> 01:26:50,686
James Coughlin.

1177
01:26:50,936 --> 01:26:52,896
Albert Magloan.

1178
01:26:54,231 --> 01:26:55,774
Desmond Eden.

1179
01:26:55,941 --> 01:26:58,861
Part of a crew that we tied
into the bank job at North End...

1180
01:26:59,027 --> 01:27:03,115
...and at least three other
armored car robberies.

1181
01:27:07,578 --> 01:27:09,121
Look familiar?

1182
01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:14,334
You opened the safe for him.

1183
01:27:15,085 --> 01:27:17,504
He left you unharmed...

1184
01:27:17,671 --> 01:27:22,718
...and now the two of you are carrying on a
relationship about which you lied to the FBI.

1185
01:27:22,885 --> 01:27:23,969
I was wrong.

1186
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:26,847
You do need a lawyer.

1187
01:27:34,855 --> 01:27:36,482
Something wrong with the apartment?

1188
01:27:36,648 --> 01:27:38,859
No. Florist.

1189
01:27:39,777 --> 01:27:40,944
Florist? What?

1190
01:27:41,111 --> 01:27:42,613
Came through.

1191
01:27:43,071 --> 01:27:46,366
-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-It's large, Dougy.

1192
01:27:46,533 --> 01:27:48,702
-It's large.
-We're smoked. Punt it.

1193
01:27:49,036 --> 01:27:51,997
-Who else is gonna buy it?
-You should've thought about that...

1194
01:27:52,164 --> 01:27:54,750
...before you kept breaking the guy off
for 40 dimes.

1195
01:27:54,917 --> 01:27:57,252
-There's an expectation for me.
-I'll correct it.

1196
01:27:57,419 --> 01:28:01,048
-Oh, you will? Okay.
-Yeah. Look.

1197
01:28:01,215 --> 01:28:06,386
Look, pick up an extra guy. All right?
Or go with three guys.

1198
01:28:06,637 --> 01:28:08,889
Or fucking be smart and boot it.

1199
01:28:09,056 --> 01:28:11,016
Oh, so you're not going?

1200
01:28:12,184 --> 01:28:13,435
No.

1201
01:28:15,229 --> 01:28:16,647
And why's that?

1202
01:28:16,814 --> 01:28:19,149
Because we got a ton of heat on us,
for one thing.

1203
01:28:19,316 --> 01:28:21,735
We'll put a move on.
We've done it a hundred times.

1204
01:28:21,902 --> 01:28:24,947
You know what? Forget it.
Do what you want to do. I'm done.

1205
01:28:25,113 --> 01:28:26,740
-What? What?
-I'm done.

1206
01:28:26,907 --> 01:28:29,243
-You're done?
-What does it sound like?

1207
01:28:29,409 --> 01:28:32,079
-I don't know. What's that mean?
-What you think it means?

1208
01:28:32,246 --> 01:28:34,706
What does that mean?
Sounds like a bunch of bullshit.

1209
01:28:34,873 --> 01:28:38,752
Let me put it to you this way: I'm putting
this whole fucking town in my rear-view.

1210
01:28:41,213 --> 01:28:43,590
There's people I can't let you
walk away from.

1211
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:46,260
What?

1212
01:28:47,052 --> 01:28:48,428
Who?

1213
01:28:50,055 --> 01:28:51,473
Come on.

1214
01:28:54,268 --> 01:28:56,395
Are you serious, Jimmy?

1215
01:28:57,104 --> 01:28:58,605
She's not my kid.

1216
01:29:03,610 --> 01:29:05,821
I mean, come the f-- Cut it out.

1217
01:29:05,988 --> 01:29:08,073
All you give a fuck about
is coke and Xbox...

1218
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:11,118
...now you're trying to play it off
like you care about Shyne?

1219
01:29:11,285 --> 01:29:14,162
Know what your problem is?
You think you're better than people.

1220
01:29:14,329 --> 01:29:16,999
Mr. Fucking-Clean.
Mr. Fucking-Goddamn-High-and-Mighty.

1221
01:29:17,165 --> 01:29:19,918
I'm better than all these people.
I'm better than everybody.

1222
01:29:20,085 --> 01:29:22,337
But you grew up right here.

1223
01:29:22,921 --> 01:29:25,007
Same rules that I did.

1224
01:29:25,549 --> 01:29:26,842
Okay.

1225
01:29:27,301 --> 01:29:28,844
What else?

1226
01:29:30,971 --> 01:29:32,472
Who the fuck's the father?

1227
01:29:33,682 --> 01:29:35,809
-I know I'm not.
-You were the one fucking her.

1228
01:29:35,976 --> 01:29:38,228
Yeah, I wasn't the only one, brother.

1229
01:29:38,478 --> 01:29:40,689
Okay? She knew
I knew I'm not the father...

1230
01:29:40,856 --> 01:29:43,442
...and I have enough respect for her
not to ask her.

1231
01:29:43,609 --> 01:29:45,319
Because I don't think she knows.

1232
01:29:45,485 --> 01:29:48,322
I don't wanna shatter
your illusions here, partner.

1233
01:29:48,488 --> 01:29:50,616
There aren't enough free clinics
in Mattapan...

1234
01:29:50,782 --> 01:29:53,368
...to find out who the father
of that kid is.

1235
01:29:53,911 --> 01:29:56,371
I don't know who the fuck
you think you are either.

1236
01:29:57,039 --> 01:29:59,750
You aren't letting me
or not letting me do shit, all right?

1237
01:29:59,917 --> 01:30:01,585
Here's a little cheat sheet for you.

1238
01:30:01,752 --> 01:30:04,838
It's never gonna be me and you
and your sister and Shyne...

1239
01:30:05,005 --> 01:30:06,590
...fucking playing house up there.

1240
01:30:06,757 --> 01:30:10,052
All right? You got it?
Get that in your fucking head!

1241
01:30:10,218 --> 01:30:13,221
I'm tired of your one-way
fucking bullshit.

1242
01:30:13,388 --> 01:30:17,517
If you wanna see me again,
come down and visit me in Florida.

1243
01:30:23,398 --> 01:30:24,441
Cunt.

1244
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:54,638
In the 302...

1245
01:30:55,430 --> 01:30:58,100
...feds have me dropping Brendan
right here.

1246
01:30:59,685 --> 01:31:01,979
<i>I got him back on Tibbetts.</i>

1247
01:31:03,563 --> 01:31:05,565
Shot him right in the chest.

1248
01:31:07,067 --> 01:31:08,402
I remember he looked at me.

1249
01:31:08,568 --> 01:31:12,072
I don't know who was more fucking
surprised he wasn't dead, him or me.

1250
01:31:12,406 --> 01:31:14,408
We just kind of stood there...

1251
01:31:15,075 --> 01:31:18,537
...for a second, like, waiting for some
shit to happen. I don't know what.

1252
01:31:19,746 --> 01:31:21,415
He started running.

1253
01:31:21,915 --> 01:31:24,876
Fucking guy ran 100 yards
with a bullet in his heart, Dougy.

1254
01:31:25,043 --> 01:31:29,172
I mean, the fucking guy should've ran track.
You know what I'm saying?

1255
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:34,636
I didn't ask you to do that.

1256
01:31:34,803 --> 01:31:36,930
Yeah, well, you didn't have to, Dougy.
Come on.

1257
01:31:37,597 --> 01:31:41,518
They told me Brendan was coming down
here to roll up on you with a Glock 21.

1258
01:31:41,685 --> 01:31:44,646
So I came over here,
and I put him in the fucking ground.

1259
01:31:46,523 --> 01:31:48,233
Did nine years for it.

1260
01:31:50,193 --> 01:31:51,945
Now, you don't gotta thank me...

1261
01:31:52,654 --> 01:31:54,448
...but you're not walking away.

1262
01:31:56,616 --> 01:31:59,453
I'm grateful for everything you done
for me.

1263
01:32:00,746 --> 01:32:03,707
Your family took me in
when my father went away.

1264
01:32:06,543 --> 01:32:08,378
You're like a brother to me.

1265
01:32:10,130 --> 01:32:11,798
But I'm leaving.

1266
01:32:14,634 --> 01:32:16,261
Gonna shoot me?

1267
01:32:17,471 --> 01:32:18,972
Go ahead.

1268
01:32:20,265 --> 01:32:22,684
But you're gonna have to shoot me
in the back.

1269
01:32:34,905 --> 01:32:36,823
-Don't get up.
-All right.

1270
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:38,784
How you doing, Fergie?

1271
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:42,746
Listen, just wanted to stop by
and tell you myself...

1272
01:32:43,497 --> 01:32:46,249
...whatever this thing is you got
going on...

1273
01:32:46,416 --> 01:32:49,503
...I think my guys can handle it
without me. You know what I mean?

1274
01:32:49,669 --> 01:32:51,671
I wouldn't hire them without you.

1275
01:32:51,838 --> 01:32:53,757
And I wouldn't hire you without them.

1276
01:32:53,924 --> 01:32:55,175
You're a unit.

1277
01:32:55,342 --> 01:32:59,137
Look, with all due respect,
I didn't come here for a debate.

1278
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:01,348
I'm not doing it.

1279
01:33:01,598 --> 01:33:05,477
So, you know, work it out
however you can. I...

1280
01:33:05,644 --> 01:33:08,438
Calm down. Okay?

1281
01:33:08,605 --> 01:33:11,525
It goes against
my better judgment...

1282
01:33:12,234 --> 01:33:15,362
...but just out of respect,
smooth things over...

1283
01:33:15,862 --> 01:33:18,156
...just take this for it, all right?

1284
01:33:18,740 --> 01:33:19,825
Not gonna cut it.

1285
01:33:20,534 --> 01:33:23,537
Do you think I'm gonna put
Joe Flipperhead on this?

1286
01:33:24,037 --> 01:33:25,997
You're gonna do what I ask.

1287
01:33:26,164 --> 01:33:27,374
Not gonna cut it, huh?

1288
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,211
Okay.

1289
01:33:31,378 --> 01:33:34,464
Let me ask you something.
Who the fuck do you think you are?

1290
01:33:34,881 --> 01:33:36,967
The only guy in Charlestown
with a gun?

1291
01:33:37,384 --> 01:33:39,302
You guys run numbers and pump dope.

1292
01:33:39,469 --> 01:33:42,556
You're an old guy who don't know
his glory years are behind him.

1293
01:33:42,722 --> 01:33:45,725
I ain't fucking working for you.
Got it?

1294
01:33:46,393 --> 01:33:50,814
You got a problem with that, I live at
551 Bunker Hill Street. Stop by anytime.

1295
01:33:50,981 --> 01:33:52,691
You know where to find me.

1296
01:33:53,316 --> 01:33:55,360
You're gonna do this for me...

1297
01:33:55,527 --> 01:33:57,904
...or I'm gonna clip your nuts...

1298
01:33:58,238 --> 01:33:59,698
...like I clipped your daddy's.

1299
01:34:00,323 --> 01:34:01,867
Don't talk about my father.

1300
01:34:02,033 --> 01:34:04,578
Son, I knew your daddy.

1301
01:34:04,744 --> 01:34:07,664
He worked for me for years. Years.

1302
01:34:08,206 --> 01:34:10,292
Then he wanted his own thing.

1303
01:34:13,044 --> 01:34:14,087
You play the horses?

1304
01:34:15,881 --> 01:34:20,635
You know, they either geld a horse
with a knife...

1305
01:34:20,802 --> 01:34:22,762
...or with the chemicals.

1306
01:34:23,263 --> 01:34:25,348
When your daddy said no to me...

1307
01:34:25,807 --> 01:34:27,767
...I did him the chemical way.

1308
01:34:28,351 --> 01:34:30,103
Gave your mother a taste.

1309
01:34:30,270 --> 01:34:31,897
Put the hook into her.

1310
01:34:32,272 --> 01:34:34,608
She doped up good and proper.

1311
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:38,195
Hung herself with a wire
on Melnea Cass.

1312
01:34:38,820 --> 01:34:41,740
And you? Running around
the neighborhood, looking for her.

1313
01:34:42,616 --> 01:34:44,951
Your daddy didn't have the heart
to tell his son...

1314
01:34:45,118 --> 01:34:48,288
...that he was looking for a suicide doper
who was never coming home.

1315
01:34:49,706 --> 01:34:53,084
If there's a heaven, son,
she ain't in it.

1316
01:34:58,423 --> 01:34:59,466
Oh.

1317
01:35:01,635 --> 01:35:04,054
I hear you got a nice,
sweet new girlfriend.

1318
01:35:04,221 --> 01:35:05,764
Lives on the park.

1319
01:35:06,556 --> 01:35:09,643
I don't want to send her
funeral arrangement to your house...

1320
01:35:10,518 --> 01:35:12,354
...but I Will if I have to.

1321
01:35:13,355 --> 01:35:15,398
Now I know where to find you.

1322
01:35:17,192 --> 01:35:18,652
Claire.

1323
01:35:19,653 --> 01:35:21,279
Claire?

1324
01:35:32,958 --> 01:35:34,167
-Hey.
-Get out.

1325
01:35:34,334 --> 01:35:35,502
You Okay?

1326
01:35:36,253 --> 01:35:38,672
-Get out.
-Hold on one second.

1327
01:35:38,838 --> 01:35:40,340
I have this on 911.

1328
01:35:40,507 --> 01:35:43,677
All right, you need to give me a chance
to explain myself first. Okay?

1329
01:35:43,843 --> 01:35:44,928
No. You had a chance.

1330
01:35:46,263 --> 01:35:47,806
Who talked to you?

1331
01:35:49,266 --> 01:35:51,518
The FBI, Doug.

1332
01:35:53,770 --> 01:35:55,689
You have to listen to me.

1333
01:35:55,855 --> 01:35:58,358
You have to let me explain this.
You understand?

1334
01:35:58,525 --> 01:36:01,736
-There's a lot going on here, Claire--
-No, you go to fucking hell!

1335
01:36:02,487 --> 01:36:04,364
-Fucking hell.
-All right, all right.

1336
01:36:04,531 --> 01:36:06,032
All right. All right.

1337
01:36:06,199 --> 01:36:07,826
Easy, now.

1338
01:36:09,035 --> 01:36:10,954
Why did you do this to me?

1339
01:36:11,121 --> 01:36:13,915
Claire, I'm sorry. Okay?

1340
01:36:14,082 --> 01:36:16,960
I was gonna tell you.
I came over here that night to tell you.

1341
01:36:17,127 --> 01:36:20,797
What, the night you fucked me?
Is that your thing?

1342
01:36:20,964 --> 01:36:25,510
It's not enough to terrorize someone,
you have to fuck them too?

1343
01:36:25,677 --> 01:36:30,515
-Listen to me. Calm down, okay?
-No. No. Get out. Get out!

1344
01:36:32,017 --> 01:36:36,896
You don't ever let me see you again.
Never, never.

1345
01:39:05,587 --> 01:39:07,797
I'm taking off for a while.

1346
01:39:08,465 --> 01:39:10,633
Are you taking heat?

1347
01:39:18,391 --> 01:39:20,518
Well, when are you coming back?

1348
01:39:26,524 --> 01:39:29,903
You know about this thing for Fergie
Jem wants me to do?

1349
01:39:30,069 --> 01:39:31,404
Yeah.

1350
01:39:35,158 --> 01:39:37,243
Tell him I say yes for me, will you?

1351
01:39:40,079 --> 01:39:41,539
Yeah.

1352
01:39:53,593 --> 01:39:55,053
All right.

1353
01:39:56,513 --> 01:39:57,764
I'm in.

1354
01:39:58,932 --> 01:40:01,184
But if anything happens to her...

1355
01:40:01,351 --> 01:40:03,603
...if I think anything
might happen to her...

1356
01:40:04,437 --> 01:40:05,605
...I'm coming back here.

1357
01:40:06,648 --> 01:40:09,692
And I'm gonna kill both of you
in your own shop.

1358
01:40:25,959 --> 01:40:27,669
Hey, Claire?

1359
01:40:29,295 --> 01:40:32,757
I just wanna talk to you,
just for two minutes. Okay?

1360
01:40:33,466 --> 01:40:35,051
Come on.

1361
01:40:36,511 --> 01:40:37,971
Claire, I would never hurt you.

1362
01:40:38,137 --> 01:40:40,598
I don't know what you would--
Don't fucking touch me.

1363
01:40:40,765 --> 01:40:41,933
All right.

1364
01:40:42,308 --> 01:40:43,643
I'm sorry.

1365
01:40:44,143 --> 01:40:46,646
Just listen to me for a second,
all right?

1366
01:40:46,813 --> 01:40:48,314
I will never lie to you again.

1367
01:40:48,481 --> 01:40:50,650
-Really?
-Yes, I promise you.

1368
01:40:51,150 --> 01:40:53,486
Ask me anything you want.
I'll tell you the truth.

1369
01:40:53,653 --> 01:40:55,530
-Why? I won't believe you.
-Yes, you will.

1370
01:40:55,697 --> 01:40:56,739
Why?

1371
01:40:56,906 --> 01:40:59,158
Because you'll fucking hate
the answers.

1372
01:41:03,871 --> 01:41:06,541
-You knew I was the manager in the bank?
-Yup.

1373
01:41:06,708 --> 01:41:09,085
-Were you following me?
-Yes.

1374
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:11,004
How many banks have you robbed?

1375
01:41:11,879 --> 01:41:13,423
Six trucks, two banks.

1376
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,425
Have you ever killed anyone?

1377
01:41:15,592 --> 01:41:17,135
No.

1378
01:41:18,261 --> 01:41:19,554
Think about it.

1379
01:41:20,263 --> 01:41:21,598
All right?

1380
01:41:21,764 --> 01:41:24,183
I will never lie to you,
I will never hurt you...

1381
01:41:24,350 --> 01:41:29,647
...and if I lose you, I will
regret that for the rest of my life.

1382
01:41:32,525 --> 01:41:35,445
Just wait for me.

1383
01:41:47,457 --> 01:41:50,877
<i>You know, it's funny.
I can see your daddies' faces in you.</i>

1384
01:41:51,044 --> 01:41:52,128
All of youse.

1385
01:41:52,295 --> 01:41:54,047
Reminds me I'm still in the ring.

1386
01:41:54,380 --> 01:41:58,635
Still taking the punches.
Still ahead on points.

1387
01:41:59,010 --> 01:42:01,763
Now, I have a fellow
on the inside there.

1388
01:42:01,929 --> 01:42:05,725
He likes to play the ponies.
Has a gambling sickness.

1389
01:42:05,892 --> 01:42:08,519
He couldn't pick a horse
to save his fucking life.

1390
01:42:09,062 --> 01:42:11,356
But courtesy of this sick man...

1391
01:42:12,315 --> 01:42:15,026
...I have this. Hm?

1392
01:42:16,903 --> 01:42:19,697
Well, the gang's all here.

1393
01:42:21,991 --> 01:42:23,743
There's always a weak spot.

1394
01:42:23,910 --> 01:42:25,912
We just need to find it.

1395
01:42:29,457 --> 01:42:33,419
The cash is brought out and stacked
15 minutes before the van does the pickup.

1396
01:42:34,712 --> 01:42:36,798
That is when you hit.

1397
01:42:37,215 --> 01:42:39,967
And Monday morning,
after a four-game stand with New York...

1398
01:42:40,134 --> 01:42:45,056
...60,000 beers, food, merchandise,
total haul:

1399
01:42:45,223 --> 01:42:46,724
Three and a half million.

1400
01:42:50,770 --> 01:42:55,108
Taking down the cathedral of Boston.

1401
01:42:55,316 --> 01:42:56,442
Priceless.

1402
01:43:11,416 --> 01:43:14,460
How long you think it's gonna take Rusty
to dump the inside man...

1403
01:43:14,627 --> 01:43:15,837
...when this thing's over?

1404
01:43:16,003 --> 01:43:18,631
Well, he should have picked
better horses.

1405
01:43:22,009 --> 01:43:24,762
This is gonna be a motherfucker.
You know that, right?

1406
01:43:25,805 --> 01:43:29,809
Well, if they were easy, kid,
everybody would do them.

1407
01:43:34,313 --> 01:43:37,692
<i>Lined into right field.
A base hit. Youkilis is headed for third base.</i>

1408
01:43:37,859 --> 01:43:40,611
Hey, Bobby. Yeah, three Buds.

1409
01:43:48,911 --> 01:43:51,873
Seem to be having a bit
of a staring contest over there.

1410
01:43:52,039 --> 01:43:53,207
What can I say?

1411
01:43:53,833 --> 01:43:55,376
Boys like me.

1412
01:43:56,836 --> 01:43:58,171
I bet they do.

1413
01:44:03,843 --> 01:44:06,137
I was at a bar one night, right?

1414
01:44:06,304 --> 01:44:09,140
There was this guy there
going around to all the ladies...

1415
01:44:09,307 --> 01:44:13,728
...and telling them that he was
judging a hugging contest.

1416
01:44:14,312 --> 01:44:17,231
Some of them actually bought it, right?

1417
01:44:17,398 --> 01:44:21,944
So he throws his arms around them,
rubs their back, grabs their ass.

1418
01:44:22,111 --> 01:44:23,488
Charming.

1419
01:44:25,031 --> 01:44:27,408
Finally I get sick of it
and I go up to this guy...

1420
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:32,371
...and I tell him that I am judging
a face-punching contest.

1421
01:44:32,538 --> 01:44:36,042
Oh. I'd have punched him myself.

1422
01:44:45,218 --> 01:44:47,804
By the way, I'm here tonight
judging a fucking contest.

1423
01:44:51,724 --> 01:44:53,601
What are you doing down here?

1424
01:44:54,227 --> 01:44:55,478
Slumming?

1425
01:44:57,104 --> 01:44:58,898
I work for the FBI.

1426
01:44:59,857 --> 01:45:01,567
Me too.

1427
01:45:02,944 --> 01:45:04,403
Well, you must be new.

1428
01:45:07,740 --> 01:45:09,242
You're all right.

1429
01:45:10,117 --> 01:45:12,578
It doesn't mean
you're getting fucked, though.

1430
01:45:13,079 --> 01:45:16,582
You gotta chase the rabbit
if you want the tail.

1431
01:45:18,209 --> 01:45:19,502
My mom taught me that.

1432
01:45:24,173 --> 01:45:26,884
You used to hang around
with Doug MacRay a little bit, huh?

1433
01:45:28,052 --> 01:45:29,428
How do you know Dougy?

1434
01:45:29,595 --> 01:45:31,305
We sort of work together.

1435
01:45:31,722 --> 01:45:33,015
Sand and Gravel?

1436
01:45:33,641 --> 01:45:35,393
No. No, no.

1437
01:45:42,733 --> 01:45:45,111
You a pretty decent judge of size?

1438
01:45:45,653 --> 01:45:46,946
Depends.

1439
01:45:47,613 --> 01:45:49,115
Size of what?

1440
01:45:50,449 --> 01:45:51,951
How big would you say that is'?

1441
01:45:52,827 --> 01:45:54,036
Six inches?

1442
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:56,122
Over or under?

1443
01:45:56,455 --> 01:45:57,498
Under.

1444
01:45:57,665 --> 01:45:58,833
Wrong.

1445
01:45:59,417 --> 01:46:01,627
6.14 inches exactly.

1446
01:46:03,296 --> 01:46:05,423
I know everything there is to know
about money.

1447
01:46:05,631 --> 01:46:08,467
Thickness: .0043 inches.

1448
01:46:09,302 --> 01:46:13,222
Weight: about one gram.

1449
01:46:13,931 --> 01:46:15,850
Which is interesting...

1450
01:46:16,017 --> 01:46:19,812
...because that means that this $20 bill
isn't even worth its own weight...

1451
01:46:19,979 --> 01:46:21,939
...in Oxy.

1452
01:46:27,653 --> 01:46:29,155
So how does it work?

1453
01:46:30,323 --> 01:46:32,158
Bartender gets a call...

1454
01:46:33,242 --> 01:46:36,245
...you pick up a package at point A,
deliver it to point B...

1455
01:46:36,412 --> 01:46:38,956
...the Florist gives you C?

1456
01:46:42,752 --> 01:46:44,587
You're thinking of running out on me.

1457
01:46:46,297 --> 01:46:49,342
It's not that simple.
Because, you see...

1458
01:46:50,426 --> 01:46:52,261
...I start waving this around
in here...

1459
01:46:57,016 --> 01:46:58,351
...bad for you.

1460
01:47:02,730 --> 01:47:04,357
I want a lawyer.

1461
01:47:04,690 --> 01:47:06,609
Good. Get one.

1462
01:47:07,526 --> 01:47:10,112
I mean, it's all about protecting
yourself, right?

1463
01:47:10,404 --> 01:47:13,699
Not even yourself. Your daughter.

1464
01:47:13,866 --> 01:47:16,369
Don't talk about my daughter.

1465
01:47:18,663 --> 01:47:21,040
How long were you with MacRay?

1466
01:47:22,124 --> 01:47:23,417
All my life.

1467
01:47:24,710 --> 01:47:27,296
In all those years
that you were together...

1468
01:47:29,215 --> 01:47:32,426
...how many diamond necklaces
did he give you?

1469
01:47:37,223 --> 01:47:41,727
<i>All right, here's the deal.
Looks like we're pretty dialed in.</i>

1470
01:47:44,355 --> 01:47:47,400
<i>Dez took the van home
over the weekend...</i>

1471
01:47:47,566 --> 01:47:49,193
<i>...so that should work.</i>

1472
01:47:52,530 --> 01:47:55,741
<i>He's meeting bug eyes at the plant
on Monday.</i>

1473
01:47:59,870 --> 01:48:03,874
<i>Krista booked the rooms, set up the outfits,
and made the New Hampshire run.</i>

1474
01:48:06,377 --> 01:48:08,504
That's what I got. How you looking?

1475
01:48:08,671 --> 01:48:10,423
All right, the tools are set.

1476
01:48:10,589 --> 01:48:12,758
Got our body armor.

1477
01:48:16,178 --> 01:48:18,014
You know, this thing goes right...

1478
01:48:18,431 --> 01:48:20,808
...could be your turn
to step away too.

1479
01:48:20,975 --> 01:48:23,936
Yeah. Sure.

1480
01:48:24,186 --> 01:48:25,771
What am I gonna do, Dougy, huh?

1481
01:48:25,938 --> 01:48:30,443
Go down to Margaritaville, drink me
half a yard and fall off fucking bar stools?

1482
01:48:32,069 --> 01:48:33,612
Do me a favor.

1483
01:48:34,155 --> 01:48:35,948
The weight of this thing...

1484
01:48:36,615 --> 01:48:38,701
...pack a parachute at least.

1485
01:48:39,160 --> 01:48:41,871
You know the funniest thing
about being in prison?

1486
01:48:43,914 --> 01:48:46,208
Guys pretending
that they wanna get out.

1487
01:48:49,128 --> 01:48:50,421
Fuck.

1488
01:48:51,505 --> 01:48:55,134
You ever hear the old-timers
call a guy a "50-pound horse"?

1489
01:48:55,634 --> 01:48:58,095
"Fifty-pound horse"? No.

1490
01:48:58,262 --> 01:49:00,056
All right. Ahem.

1491
01:49:00,222 --> 01:49:02,558
A guy's walking with two horses, right?

1492
01:49:02,725 --> 01:49:06,479
One horse is carrying a hundred pounds,
the other one's got 50.

1493
01:49:06,645 --> 01:49:11,650
Now, the hundred-pound horse falls over
dead. So the guy's like, "What the fuck?"

1494
01:49:11,817 --> 01:49:14,904
Takes the hundred-pound sack,
puts it on the 50-pound horse.

1495
01:49:15,071 --> 01:49:17,990
Then that 50-pound horse,
he won't move.

1496
01:49:19,116 --> 01:49:22,495
He won't take one step
with another pound on his back.

1497
01:49:23,412 --> 01:49:24,997
That's me.

1498
01:49:30,294 --> 01:49:32,254
This is all I know.

1499
01:49:35,466 --> 01:49:37,676
I can't do any more time, Dougy.

1500
01:49:40,429 --> 01:49:42,056
So if we get jammed up...

1501
01:49:42,681 --> 01:49:44,642
...we're holding court on the street.

1502
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:47,353
All right?

1503
01:49:53,526 --> 01:49:54,985
Mme

1504
01:49:56,278 --> 01:49:57,488
What's that?

1505
01:49:57,655 --> 01:49:59,907
The story the old-timers tell...

1506
01:50:00,074 --> 01:50:02,076
...it ain't a horse.

1507
01:50:02,576 --> 01:50:05,121
It's a 50-pound mule.

1508
01:50:06,205 --> 01:50:08,040
See you out there.

1509
01:50:12,002 --> 01:50:13,379
What time did he get here?

1510
01:50:13,546 --> 01:50:16,382
Six a.m. according to the GPS
we have on his truck.

1511
01:50:16,549 --> 01:50:17,675
So we alerted you.

1512
01:50:20,136 --> 01:50:21,846
Pop the door, kick their nuts in.

1513
01:50:22,012 --> 01:50:24,932
We should wait for them
to commit a crime, don't you think, Dino?

1514
01:50:25,099 --> 01:50:26,142
No switch car.

1515
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:29,812
<i>Ran a cue hot on the parking lot.</i>

1516
01:50:29,979 --> 01:50:31,230
<i>That Cherokee is boosted.</i>

1517
01:50:37,361 --> 01:50:39,363
Call SWAT now.

1518
01:50:45,202 --> 01:50:46,370
FBI! Open the door!

1519
01:50:46,537 --> 01:50:48,164
- FBI!
- Open the door! Open it!

1520
01:50:48,330 --> 01:50:50,207
Open the door! Open it!

1521
01:50:50,583 --> 01:50:51,750
FBI! FBI!

1522
01:50:53,085 --> 01:50:55,462
You brought the whole fucking
cavalry for me?

1523
01:50:55,629 --> 01:50:57,798
I'm unarmed, you motherfuckers.

1524
01:51:15,024 --> 01:51:17,318
Fuck are you doing here, Kris?

1525
01:51:17,943 --> 01:51:19,236
I need to talk to you.

1526
01:51:19,403 --> 01:51:21,030
Not a great time, hon.

1527
01:51:21,197 --> 01:51:22,406
-I know.
-You know?

1528
01:51:22,573 --> 01:51:24,533
Okay. Well, what do you want?

1529
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:25,993
Here you go.

1530
01:51:26,452 --> 01:51:28,245
Dez told me you were here.

1531
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:31,457
I wanna see you before you go.

1532
01:51:31,624 --> 01:51:34,960
Kris, you could do 30 years
for walking in the door.

1533
01:51:35,127 --> 01:51:37,296
Okay? Do you understand that?
For being here.

1534
01:51:37,463 --> 01:51:40,507
You can't be bringing your kid
in here, you got it? You can't stay.

1535
01:51:40,674 --> 01:51:43,260
I don't wanna stay,
I wanna go with you.

1536
01:51:43,677 --> 01:51:45,512
-I wanna change too, Dougy.
-Christ.

1537
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:48,599
Why the fuck can't I change?
I could be a different person.

1538
01:51:48,766 --> 01:51:50,100
Jesus Christ.

1539
01:51:50,267 --> 01:51:53,520
You tell me what you want me to do.
I'll be whoever you want me to be.

1540
01:51:54,897 --> 01:51:56,899
I'm leaving with somebody else.

1541
01:52:01,070 --> 01:52:02,363
Oh, yeah?

1542
01:52:02,988 --> 01:52:04,198
Yeah.

1543
01:52:06,075 --> 01:52:07,993
Why isn't she here then?

1544
01:52:09,203 --> 01:52:11,080
Come on.
What do you want me to tell you?

1545
01:52:11,247 --> 01:52:13,832
She's going away with you,
why isn't she here?

1546
01:52:13,999 --> 01:52:15,918
Where is she? She's not here.

1547
01:52:17,503 --> 01:52:19,713
-Such a trashy little fuck pad.
-Take it easy.

1548
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:23,008
After a Tiffany necklace,
I thought a room at the Ritz.

1549
01:52:23,425 --> 01:52:24,969
Huh?

1550
01:52:26,136 --> 01:52:27,513
What'd you say?

1551
01:52:28,681 --> 01:52:31,517
Where did you hear that?
Where'd you hear about a necklace?

1552
01:52:31,934 --> 01:52:33,519
A little bird.

1553
01:52:35,854 --> 01:52:38,691
Fucking smartass. Who told you that?
Who told you about a necklace?

1554
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:43,237
I know you'd rather see a rope
around my neck!

1555
01:52:44,905 --> 01:52:47,157
You're getting the fuck out of here.
Let's go.

1556
01:52:47,324 --> 01:52:50,327
Come here, honey.
I know, it's gonna be okay. It's all right.

1557
01:52:50,494 --> 01:52:52,871
- We're coming with you.
- You're getting out of here.

1558
01:52:53,038 --> 01:52:54,873
Dougy, we're fucking coming with you.

1559
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:58,252
It's time to go. Okay? Here we go.

1560
01:52:58,419 --> 01:53:01,714
Time to go, sweetheart. Okay?

1561
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:03,382
-I'm not leaving here.
-Let's go.

1562
01:53:03,549 --> 01:53:05,634
-I'm not fucking leaving.
-Take the kid home.

1563
01:53:05,801 --> 01:53:07,469
Get the fuck off me!

1564
01:53:07,636 --> 01:53:09,555
I can walk myself.

1565
01:53:10,055 --> 01:53:11,974
Don't you say no to me!

1566
01:53:15,394 --> 01:53:16,812
Take this.

1567
01:53:24,236 --> 01:53:25,404
Hey.

1568
01:53:26,030 --> 01:53:29,366
Will you quit fucking doing that?
You're making me nervous.

1569
01:53:43,922 --> 01:53:47,259
Yeah, we got a DWI over here, one car.

1570
01:53:47,426 --> 01:53:50,846
Coughlin, Kristina.
She had a kid with her.

1571
01:53:51,513 --> 01:53:54,099
<i>The mother's at Mass General.
She wanted me to call you.</i>

1572
01:53:54,266 --> 01:53:56,894
All right, yeah. I'll be right there.

1573
01:54:25,172 --> 01:54:26,382
Officer.

1574
01:54:27,383 --> 01:54:28,926
Yeah. Let's go.

1575
01:54:36,225 --> 01:54:37,559
Down here.

1576
01:55:30,946 --> 01:55:32,614
There's the door.

1577
01:55:33,198 --> 01:55:35,826
And remember,
you never fucking saw me.

1578
01:55:36,076 --> 01:55:37,244
Okay.

1579
01:55:52,217 --> 01:55:54,928
<i>Dr. Forrest, dial 112, please.</i>

1580
01:55:55,095 --> 01:55:58,056
<i>Dr. Forrest, please dial 112.</i>

1581
01:56:02,227 --> 01:56:05,898
Here he is, Mr. Six-Inches.

1582
01:56:07,733 --> 01:56:08,775
What happened?

1583
01:56:08,942 --> 01:56:12,362
You're a crimestopper,
figure it the fuck out.

1584
01:56:14,406 --> 01:56:15,657
Sweetheart.

1585
01:56:16,742 --> 01:56:20,287
I know you have oxycodone,
cocaine and alcohol in your system.

1586
01:56:21,497 --> 01:56:24,082
I know that you have five cars
registered in your name.

1587
01:56:24,249 --> 01:56:27,753
And I know right now, your daughter
is sitting in the back of a state van...

1588
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:30,172
...driven to
the Department of Social Services.

1589
01:56:30,339 --> 01:56:31,924
So how long you wanna do this?

1590
01:56:32,090 --> 01:56:33,258
I'm a person, you know?

1591
01:56:33,425 --> 01:56:35,594
A person
who's gonna need a plea agreement...

1592
01:56:35,761 --> 01:56:37,930
...if you ever want to see your kid again.

1593
01:56:41,558 --> 01:56:44,561
Why is it always I'm the one
who's getting used?

1594
01:56:45,479 --> 01:56:46,813
What do you have?

1595
01:56:52,861 --> 01:56:54,530
Knowing just that...

1596
01:56:55,948 --> 01:56:57,699
...Dougy's going away after.

1597
01:56:58,867 --> 01:57:01,703
Wait, what after? After what?

1598
01:57:03,914 --> 01:57:07,459
Krista, I need you to be smart here.

1599
01:57:07,876 --> 01:57:11,338
This could be a big moment for Shyne.

1600
01:57:12,548 --> 01:57:14,550
Make a huge difference in her life.

1601
01:57:22,015 --> 01:57:23,850
We can help you, sweetheart.

1602
01:58:18,530 --> 01:58:19,906
- You there?
- I'm here.

1603
01:58:20,073 --> 01:58:22,868
- All set.
- Okay. Go ahead.

1604
01:58:23,577 --> 01:58:24,870
All set.

1605
01:58:33,253 --> 01:58:34,379
Who called 911?

1606
01:58:36,006 --> 01:58:37,591
You the guys who called 911?

1607
01:58:37,758 --> 01:58:39,259
No one from here called.

1608
01:58:39,426 --> 01:58:41,094
Nah, we didn't-- It wasn't us.

1609
01:58:41,261 --> 01:58:42,471
We got a 911 call.

1610
01:58:42,638 --> 01:58:44,056
Robbery, guys. Come on.

1611
01:58:44,222 --> 01:58:45,766
- You said a robbery?
- Yeah.

1612
01:58:45,932 --> 01:58:47,643
A call saying you're being held up.

1613
01:58:47,809 --> 01:58:49,478
- Let me call Mike.
- We just walked past Mike.

1614
01:58:49,645 --> 01:58:50,646
He let us in.

1615
01:58:50,812 --> 01:58:53,732
Hey, look, guys. We got a distress call.
All right?

1616
01:58:53,899 --> 01:58:56,318
-So who made the call?
-Nobody called from here.

1617
01:58:57,194 --> 01:58:59,821
No one called? What are we doing here?

1618
01:58:59,988 --> 01:59:03,158
-Hold on. Where's Mike?
-I just told you where Mike was.

1619
01:59:03,325 --> 01:59:04,409
You boys see all right?

1620
01:59:04,576 --> 01:59:06,828
-Huh? You fucking smartass.
-Listen. Listen.

1621
01:59:06,995 --> 01:59:10,040
For our safety, for everyone's safety,
we need to see your IDs.

1622
01:59:10,207 --> 01:59:12,751
Guys, hold up.
We been here all morning. Take it easy.

1623
01:59:12,918 --> 01:59:15,921
My partner asked for your ID.
All right? We don't know you.

1624
01:59:16,088 --> 01:59:19,591
Till we identify all the parties involved here,
we're gonna need some IDs...

1625
01:59:19,758 --> 01:59:21,885
...we need to see
everyone on the ground. Right now.

1626
01:59:22,052 --> 01:59:23,261
Whoa, whoa.

1627
01:59:23,428 --> 01:59:25,681
- Get your hand off your weapon.
- Hey, relax.

1628
01:59:32,187 --> 01:59:34,981
- Get on the ground!
- Get on the fucking ground.

1629
01:59:35,357 --> 01:59:36,650
Hands behind your back.

1630
01:59:36,817 --> 01:59:37,984
Face down.

1631
01:59:38,151 --> 01:59:40,570
Behind your back. Come on.

1632
01:59:47,327 --> 01:59:50,414
Get your hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back. Let's go.

1633
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:52,040
- Take it easy.
- Fuck.

1634
01:59:59,631 --> 02:00:00,882
In the cash room.

1635
02:00:01,049 --> 02:00:04,636
Arnold Washton.
You live at 311 Hazer Street in Quincy...

1636
02:00:04,803 --> 02:00:07,973
...with a wife named Linda
and three small dogs.

1637
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:10,517
Do not make a distress call.

1638
02:00:10,684 --> 02:00:12,769
Also in the cash room:

1639
02:00:12,936 --> 02:00:18,108
Morton Previtt.
You live at 27 Counting Lane, Randolph.

1640
02:00:18,275 --> 02:00:20,569
Wife, also Linda.

1641
02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:24,781
Morton, the Lindas
want you to open this door.

1642
02:00:24,990 --> 02:00:27,617
We have men outside your homes.

1643
02:00:31,705 --> 02:00:34,541
Back up. Back up.

1644
02:00:55,562 --> 02:00:57,522
You think you're gonna get out of here?

1645
02:00:57,856 --> 02:01:01,151
I got friends that are guards at Walpole.
They'll make your lives hell.

1646
02:01:01,610 --> 02:01:03,612
Well, don't you worry about it,
old-timer.

1647
02:01:03,779 --> 02:01:05,530
No one's going to prison.

1648
02:01:23,465 --> 02:01:24,925
Ten more.

1649
02:01:25,091 --> 02:01:26,343
Right away.

1650
02:01:40,106 --> 02:01:41,358
Picking up.

1651
02:02:13,431 --> 02:02:16,017
<i>least from the fen base
when the Red Sox win.</i>

1652
02:02:16,184 --> 02:02:20,230
<i>When the Red Sox win in extra innings
and everybody can go home happy...</i>

1653
02:02:20,397 --> 02:02:23,024
<i>...and they're singing "Dirty Water"--</i>

1654
02:02:25,902 --> 02:02:27,863
- How you doing?
- Fucking beautiful.

1655
02:02:30,323 --> 02:02:31,658
Come on.

1656
02:02:40,375 --> 02:02:44,212
Last motherfucker who robbed
the Red Sox like this was Jack Clark.

1657
02:03:33,678 --> 02:03:36,973
Looked around the block.
There's no cars, no vans around. Nothing.

1658
02:03:37,182 --> 02:03:39,309
Maybe we're too early. Or too late.

1659
02:03:39,476 --> 02:03:43,563
Let's go. I want this street clear. Come on,
get these people out of here. Let's go.

1660
02:03:43,730 --> 02:03:48,860
We've been trying to hail security for the
cash room. We're not getting a response.

1661
02:03:51,071 --> 02:03:53,114
Okay, let's go.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1662
02:03:53,281 --> 02:03:54,699
Come on.

1663
02:03:58,828 --> 02:04:00,080
Come on.

1664
02:04:04,376 --> 02:04:05,585
Shit.

1665
02:04:26,064 --> 02:04:29,067
- Fuck!
- Let's get the fuck out of here!

1666
02:04:34,447 --> 02:04:36,408
That's us inside.

1667
02:04:38,535 --> 02:04:39,744
Go! Go!

1668
02:04:44,082 --> 02:04:46,459
Fuckers!

1669
02:05:01,641 --> 02:05:03,727
Gloans! Gloans. Fuck.

1670
02:05:06,187 --> 02:05:09,816
- He all right?
- He's all right. They just got the vest.

1671
02:05:18,950 --> 02:05:20,535
Yo, Dez, get the plunger!

1672
02:05:39,929 --> 02:05:41,765
Shut it!

1673
02:06:02,911 --> 02:06:04,788
Dez?

1674
02:06:06,372 --> 02:06:07,874
Come on, come on.

1675
02:06:10,126 --> 02:06:11,628
They look like EMTs.

1676
02:06:11,795 --> 02:06:14,506
<i>I count four. Maybe one down.</i>

1677
02:06:14,672 --> 02:06:16,299
Go.

1678
02:06:18,802 --> 02:06:20,386
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1679
02:06:20,845 --> 02:06:23,098
There's a million fucking cops
out there.

1680
02:06:23,264 --> 02:06:24,808
Dez!

1681
02:06:27,685 --> 02:06:28,728
Listen.

1682
02:06:30,230 --> 02:06:34,859
The three of us, even if we get out of here,
we're getting the full ride, okay?

1683
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:38,071
You walk out with your hands up,
you could get seven years.

1684
02:06:38,822 --> 02:06:40,824
No one'll think the worse of you.

1685
02:06:43,118 --> 02:06:44,202
Fuck you.

1686
02:06:50,333 --> 02:06:51,626
Cover your ears!

1687
02:07:16,234 --> 02:07:17,318
No!

1688
02:07:24,409 --> 02:07:26,703
- All right, go, go, go.
- All right, move it out.

1689
02:07:43,887 --> 02:07:45,096
Fuck you!

1690
02:07:51,477 --> 02:07:53,605
Move down.
Get them the fuck out of here.

1691
02:07:53,771 --> 02:07:55,648
Meet me at the fucking switch!

1692
02:07:59,736 --> 02:08:02,071
They ain't looking for fucking cops.

1693
02:08:02,447 --> 02:08:04,282
I'm gonna roll out the front...

1694
02:08:04,449 --> 02:08:08,286
...the two of youse beat it out
the side in the fucking cop uniforms.

1695
02:08:09,204 --> 02:08:11,206
The whole fucking force
is out there, kid.

1696
02:08:11,372 --> 02:08:13,625
You know I can take a pinch.

1697
02:08:13,958 --> 02:08:17,212
Don't worry about it.
I'll only give them your first name.

1698
02:08:48,409 --> 02:08:49,994
Clear.

1699
02:08:54,791 --> 02:08:56,501
Okay, go.

1700
02:08:57,335 --> 02:08:58,836
Move, move.

1701
02:09:05,176 --> 02:09:07,345
Hey, don't move. Don't move.

1702
02:09:08,346 --> 02:09:11,099
- Put your weapons down.
- Fuck you. Boston P.D.

1703
02:09:11,266 --> 02:09:14,310
Look out, coming through.
Stand down. Stand down.

1704
02:09:14,477 --> 02:09:15,770
See you in Florida, kid.

1705
02:09:16,354 --> 02:09:18,439
See you when you get back.

1706
02:09:18,773 --> 02:09:20,275
All right. Go.

1707
02:09:20,441 --> 02:09:24,070
All right, guys, let's back up.
Feds got this.

1708
02:09:26,948 --> 02:09:28,449
Hey. Hey.

1709
02:09:28,616 --> 02:09:30,368
You B.P.D. need to fuck off.

1710
02:09:30,535 --> 02:09:32,829
What are you doing?
It's an FBI crime scene.

1711
02:09:32,996 --> 02:09:34,580
Don't put your hand up to me. Go.

1712
02:09:34,747 --> 02:09:36,457
Jurisdiction, guys. Walk away.

1713
02:09:36,624 --> 02:09:37,792
That's my kill.

1714
02:09:51,556 --> 02:09:53,641
I don't know if we're dealing with...

1715
02:09:53,808 --> 02:09:56,227
...some high level of genius here
with security...

1716
02:09:56,561 --> 02:09:59,397
...but security's saying
they got hit by cops.

1717
02:09:59,897 --> 02:10:01,149
Cops?

1718
02:10:01,316 --> 02:10:04,319
Yeah. Two cops, they said.

1719
02:10:18,624 --> 02:10:19,917
Hold up.

1720
02:10:20,209 --> 02:10:21,252
Where you going?

1721
02:10:22,295 --> 02:10:23,338
Pull up here.

1722
02:10:36,601 --> 02:10:38,686
Officer, can you hold up a minute?

1723
02:10:48,237 --> 02:10:51,783
Visual on Coughlin,
heading south toward Boylston.

1724
02:10:51,949 --> 02:10:53,826
Hotel parking lot on Van Ness.

1725
02:10:53,993 --> 02:10:55,787
He's dressed as B.P.D.

1726
02:10:56,245 --> 02:10:57,372
Copy.

1727
02:10:57,538 --> 02:10:59,082
Officer.

1728
02:11:00,958 --> 02:11:02,460
Coughlin.

1729
02:11:41,249 --> 02:11:42,917
Drop your weapon!

1730
02:11:44,752 --> 02:11:46,337
No!

1731
02:11:48,423 --> 02:11:50,091
Move! Move!

1732
02:12:14,866 --> 02:12:17,410
Coughlin, throw down your weapon.

1733
02:12:19,662 --> 02:12:21,456
Fuck you.

1734
02:12:21,956 --> 02:12:23,541
Let me see those hands, right now.

1735
02:12:23,708 --> 02:12:25,293
Fuck you!

1736
02:12:32,675 --> 02:12:34,385
Move, move.

1737
02:12:35,595 --> 02:12:37,305
You got 30 seconds, asshole.

1738
02:13:06,042 --> 02:13:07,418
Okay.

1739
02:13:07,585 --> 02:13:09,337
I surrender.

1740
02:13:09,629 --> 02:13:11,088
I surrender.

1741
02:14:12,817 --> 02:14:15,444
Rusty, something went wrong.

1742
02:14:15,611 --> 02:14:16,779
Come here.

1743
02:14:27,915 --> 02:14:29,292
Fergie.

1744
02:14:30,334 --> 02:14:31,335
Prick.

1745
02:15:02,408 --> 02:15:03,993
Fergie...

1746
02:15:04,702 --> 02:15:07,038
...remember who clipped your nuts
for you.

1747
02:15:08,372 --> 02:15:12,376
I came in hot, saw the suspect run
across the street with a Tec-9.

1748
02:15:12,543 --> 02:15:17,214
I lit up the tires, I jumped out of the cruiser,
engaged the suspect in gunfire.

1749
02:15:18,257 --> 02:15:19,258
So that's when...

1750
02:15:19,425 --> 02:15:21,218
- ...you get out of your cruiser.
- Yeah.

1751
02:15:21,385 --> 02:15:24,972
At that point, I fired, struck the suspect
at least once or twice.

1752
02:15:25,139 --> 02:15:26,265
Hey.

1753
02:15:26,557 --> 02:15:28,142
<i>Multiple victims down.</i>

1754
02:15:28,309 --> 02:15:30,102
<i>Location, 529 Main Street, Charlestown.</i>

1755
02:15:30,269 --> 02:15:32,730
<i>-Uniformed officers on the scene.</i>
-That's the Florist.

1756
02:15:32,897 --> 02:15:34,440
Hey, Bobby, Bobby, what happened?

1757
02:15:34,607 --> 02:15:36,233
Somebody got Fergie.

1758
02:15:37,943 --> 02:15:39,987
-Jesus Christ, that's gotta be MacRay.
-Fuck.

1759
02:15:46,869 --> 02:15:49,246
<i>Claire, it's me.</i>

1760
02:15:49,538 --> 02:15:50,581
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1761
02:15:51,582 --> 02:15:52,583
<i>I'll be fine. I know.</i>

1762
02:15:52,750 --> 02:15:55,211
<i>But I'm okay. I'm all right.</i>

1763
02:15:55,378 --> 02:15:57,129
<i>Claire, I wanna meet you.</i>

1764
02:15:58,756 --> 02:16:02,093
<i>It's gotta be soon.
I don't have a lot of time.</i>

1765
02:16:03,594 --> 02:16:05,096
<i>Can you meet me?</i>

1766
02:16:06,097 --> 02:16:07,264
<i>Claire, please.</i>

1767
02:16:08,099 --> 02:16:10,518
<i>I need to know. I gotta go.</i>

1768
02:16:11,560 --> 02:16:13,270
Can you come here?

1769
02:16:19,276 --> 02:16:21,320
You want me
to come where you are now?

1770
02:16:21,654 --> 02:16:22,863
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

1771
02:16:26,784 --> 02:16:29,286
I don't think
that's a good idea for me.

1772
02:16:33,082 --> 02:16:34,291
Why?

1773
02:16:39,630 --> 02:16:41,424
What if there are police there?

1774
02:16:43,467 --> 02:16:45,052
There's no one here.

1775
02:16:50,808 --> 02:16:53,728
All right, well, if you think I should
probably come by there...

1776
02:16:53,894 --> 02:16:56,313
...then I guess that's what I'll do. Yeah.

1777
02:16:57,815 --> 02:16:58,983
Okay.

1778
02:17:00,484 --> 02:17:03,279
<i>Claire, listen, I'm--
Listen. Listen to me.</i>

1779
02:17:05,448 --> 02:17:06,949
<i>I'm sorry, okay?</i>

1780
02:17:08,367 --> 02:17:10,578
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

1781
02:17:11,996 --> 02:17:13,330
Remember that.

1782
02:17:14,039 --> 02:17:17,001
<i>Come down in the back
and let me in in about an hour.</i>

1783
02:17:19,837 --> 02:17:21,297
All right?

1784
02:17:23,174 --> 02:17:24,800
I'll see you.

1785
02:17:26,218 --> 02:17:28,012
Wait, Doug? Doug?

1786
02:17:29,138 --> 02:17:30,598
-Yeah.
<i>-I want you to come.</i>

1787
02:17:30,765 --> 02:17:33,684
<i>I really wanna see you.</i>

1788
02:17:38,397 --> 02:17:41,358
It'll be just like one of my sunny days.

1789
02:17:53,662 --> 02:17:54,872
Well...

1790
02:17:57,041 --> 02:17:58,709
...I'm on my way then.

1791
02:18:01,545 --> 02:18:02,546
Bye.

1792
02:18:06,217 --> 02:18:08,135
Goodbye, Claire.

1793
02:18:14,266 --> 02:18:16,477
All right,
I'd say we've done our part here.

1794
02:18:16,644 --> 02:18:19,271
You know what? Not now.

1795
02:18:25,236 --> 02:18:28,072
He says he's coming, I want people
at Logan, South Station...

1796
02:18:28,239 --> 02:18:30,616
...downtown, Greyhound,
subway, everything. Now.

1797
02:18:30,783 --> 02:18:33,035
<i>- The city's covered.</i>
<i>- Good.</i>

1798
02:18:55,808 --> 02:18:58,561
<i>We're secure, and everything's ready.</i>

1799
02:19:04,817 --> 02:19:08,779
-Sir, we need you to stay off the street.
-Just going to work. No problem.

1800
02:19:24,962 --> 02:19:26,714
-How long?
-Forty minutes.

1801
02:19:27,214 --> 02:19:29,091
-Alleyway clear?
-Yes, sir.

1802
02:19:42,605 --> 02:19:45,691
<i>We got nothing.
Still no movement in the alley. Over.</i>

1803
02:19:47,067 --> 02:19:50,321
Well, I guess he didn't have as big a thing
for you as you thought.

1804
02:19:52,072 --> 02:19:53,908
I guess not.

1805
02:20:15,721 --> 02:20:17,306
"My sunny days?

1806
02:20:24,897 --> 02:20:27,691
You know, Claire,
we are a national organization.

1807
02:20:35,741 --> 02:20:38,827
All right, boys, let's pack it up.
He ain't coming.

1808
02:20:38,994 --> 02:20:41,455
Let's get the description out.
Let's go.

1809
02:20:41,705 --> 02:20:43,540
We know what he looks like.

1810
02:20:44,583 --> 02:20:45,918
Let's go find him.

1811
02:20:49,546 --> 02:20:50,673
All right. You good?

1812
02:20:50,839 --> 02:20:52,633
Hey, best possible outcome, you know.

1813
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:54,718
Well done, well done.

1814
02:21:32,506 --> 02:21:33,966
It's for you.

1815
02:22:39,323 --> 02:22:42,743
<i>Claire, take this.</i>

1816
02:22:43,035 --> 02:22:45,662
<i>You'll do better with it than I can.</i>

1817
02:22:46,288 --> 02:22:48,874
<i>By the time you read this,
I'll be long gone.</i>

1818
02:22:49,041 --> 02:22:50,334
<i>Not the way I planned it...</i>

1819
02:22:50,834 --> 02:22:54,880
<i>...but for the first time in my life,
I'm leaving this city.</i>

1820
02:23:07,476 --> 02:23:08,519
<i>Maybe if I go...</i>

1821
02:23:09,603 --> 02:23:11,230
<i>...I can stop looking.</i>

1822
02:23:33,252 --> 02:23:34,962
<i>No matter how much you change...</i>

1823
02:23:35,129 --> 02:23:38,048
<i>...you still have to pay the price
for the things you've done.</i>

1824
02:23:41,218 --> 02:23:43,053
<i>So I got a long road.</i>

1825
02:23:48,725 --> 02:23:51,061
<i>But I know I'll see you again.</i>

1826
02:23:56,900 --> 02:23:58,902
<i>This side or the other.</i>
