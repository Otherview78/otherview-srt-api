1
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,102
My name is Ed Warren,

2
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,647
here with my wife, Lorraine,
and Victoria Grainger.

3
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,734
It's April 20th, 1964.

4
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,530
Victoria...
when did you first notice

5
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,282
these supernatural occurrences?

6
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,619
I'm sorry,
I don't know how to do this.

7
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,622
Why don't you just
take us back to the beginning?

8
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,378
My father thought
something was following him.

9
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,840
Something he couldn't see.

10
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,094
He'd lock the doors at night,
and the next morning, they...

11
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,638
...they'd be open.

12
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,230
Then he started hearing...

13
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,274
...voices.

14
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,651
I didn't believe him.

15
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,155
I thought he was getting old,
you know?

16
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,827
But then I came in one day,
and...

17
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,166
I found him.

18
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,630
Dad!

19
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,218
It was so quiet here
after he was gone.

20
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,015
But then something changed.

21
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,060
I could feel it.

22
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,855
This really strong feeling,
like...

23
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,526
...like I'm being watched.

24
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,748
There's something in there.

25
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,210
And when I'm here alone...

26
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,338
and it's very quiet...

27
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,967
...it calls to me.

28
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,961
Hon...

29
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,132
I don't know. I don't have
a good feeling about this.

30
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,135
Ed, I can do this.

31
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,935
Lorraine...

32
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,508
My name is Lorraine Warren.

33
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,137
I'm here to help.

34
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,813
I can...
feel your spirit.

35
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,901
Your fear.

36
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,324
There's something else.

37
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,006
What are you?

38
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,741
Ed!

39
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,118
-Lorraine! Lorraine?
-Ed!

40
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,329
Lorraine, what happened?

41
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,541
The baby!

42
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,591
The hospital's
ten minutes away!

43
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,302
What was that back there?

44
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,261
I don't know!

45
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,814
-There was something...
-in the room.

46
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,232
In the mirror.

47
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,609
I don't know.

48
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,744
-When's the baby due?
-May. She's early!

49
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,037
Okay, notify Labor and Delivery.

50
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,705
We're coming in
with a possible abruption!

51
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,123
-She's abrupting.
-It's gonna be okay.

52
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,084
Ed! Something's wrong,
I can feel it!

53
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,168
It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.

54
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,795
Sir?
Sir, you have to stay out here.

55
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,296
-No, Lorraine! Lorraine!
-Sir! Sir!

56
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,173
Lorraine! Lorraine!

57
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,758
We need to get the baby out.

58
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,385
You've gotta push.

59
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,725
She's losing blood.

60
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,477
-We got blood on the way?
-Yes.

61
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,604
Where's Ed?

62
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,314
How's the baby?

63
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,316
-What's her vitals?
-Where's Ed?

64
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,652
Pulse, 130.
Pressure, 80 over 40.

65
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,112
Damn it!

66
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,490
Get me a flashlight.

67
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,924
Something's here!

68
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,910
Power's out! Lorraine!

69
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,412
-No, no! Lorraine?
-Ed!

70
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,330
Please-- No, please,
I need to talk to my wife.

71
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,292
Don't get in the way.

72
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,880
Ed...
Don't let it hurt the baby.

73
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,549
Don't let what hurt the baby?

74
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,509
Please.

75
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,678
All right,
the head's right here.

76
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,846
You need to push, Mrs. Warren.

77
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,351
Stop pushing! The head's out.

78
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,520
The cord's around the neck.

79
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,689
I need two clamps and scissors.

80
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,902
What? What'd he say?

81
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,946
What's wrong?

82
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,906
One more push.

83
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,699
We gotta get this baby out.

84
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,034
Okay. It's okay.

85
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,994
It's coming. It's coming.

86
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,882
I need that light.
She's still bleeding.

87
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,383
Something's wrong.

88
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,927
What's wrong with her?

89
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,012
-Something's wrong!
-Do you need help?

90
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,180
Please.

91
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,433
Doctor, what's wrong?

92
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,852
Doctor, what's happening?
What's going on?

93
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,125
Give me my baby.

94
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,964
Give me my baby!

95
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,103
I'm so sorry.

96
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,611
Oh.

97
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,780
Oh.

98
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,577
God.

99
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,787
Oh, please, Heavenly Father.

100
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,747
Please, bring her back.

101
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,790
Oh, God.

102
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,960
Please, bring her back.

103
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,253
Oh, God.

104
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,549
Heavenly father, please...

105
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,553
Please, bring her back.

106
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,181
Please, bring her back.

107
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,851
Please, bring her back.

108
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,021
Oh, God, please.

109
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,817
Please. Please...

110
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,242
Oh, my God! Oh!

111
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,463
Oh... oh!

112
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:43,726
Oh.

113
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,519
What's her name?

114
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,358
Her name is Judy.

115
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,402
Judy Warren.

116
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,053
Come on. Come here.

117
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,054
Come on, baby.

118
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,056
So good.

119
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,601
So good!

120
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,420
Judy!

121
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,046
What? Honey.

122
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,133
Honey.

123
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,388
I keep seeing horrible things!
And they won't go away!

124
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,473
Oh, hon!

125
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,725
All right, all right.

126
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,812
Just shut it out,
just like I taught you, okay?

127
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,564
Just like I taught you.

Mm-hmm.

I love you, too.

142
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,702
My baby...

143
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,360
Come on, boy.

144
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,449
Good boy.

145
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,284
Mom told me to get
some decorations from the attic.

146
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,119
Well, quickly.
Come on, everybody!

147
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,121
They're not holding Mass
just for us!

148
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,915
Come on, Dad. Turn the TV off.

149
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,291
Thank you, honey.

150
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,460
-Damn it!
-Language, Heather!

151
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,004
Carin, get down from there.

152
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,048
-Don't forget the camera.
-It's charged?

153
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,216
Thank you.

154
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:04,635
Mom!

155
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,512
-Heather, what?
-It's a disaster!

156
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,721
Dawn was hogging
the bathroom all morning.

157
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:08,764
-I was not!
-Oh, she was!

158
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:09,890
There was no hot water left.

159
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,517
And when I tried to dry my hair,
the outlet blew out!

160
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,143
Mom, just give me a minute.

161
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,021
Honey, there's still time
to fix your hair, right?

162
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,773
And you look so beautiful
in this dress!

163
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,316
Yeah, let's not lie to her,
Grandma.

164
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,860
I'm gonna kill you!

165
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,736
You can't kill her
on your confirmation.

166
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,993
Milo Evans Roberts.

167
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,871
Milo Evans Roberts,

168
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,331
be sealed with the gift
of the Holy Spirit.

169
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,749
-Amen.
-I don't know.

170
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,419
-Honey, you're in the shot.
-Here she comes.

171
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,462
Get out of the way.
Sorry, thank you.

172
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,466
Oh, doesn't she look beautiful?

173
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,343
...Holy Spirit.
Peace be with you.

174
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,308
Heather Elizabeth Smurl.

175
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,976
Heather Elizabeth Smurl,

176
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,520
be sealed with the gift
of the Holy Spirit.

177
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,105
Amen.

178
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,064
Peace be with you.

179
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:02,860
There she is.

180
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:06,989
She's confirmed.

181
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,616
You did it, honey.

182
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,871
-Hey, girls! Who wants dinner?
-We do!

183
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,290
-Come on! Get inside, then!
-I'm super hungry!

184
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,418
Hurry, hurry! Chop, chop, chop!
It's getting cold!

185
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,129
...to call. Yes,
it was a beautiful ceremony.

186
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,049
-John, stop!
-Oh, honey!

187
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,301
You know how much
I love your dips!

188
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,345
-Ah! I love it!
-Ugh...

189
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,308
-Hold on...
-Where should I put the salad?

190
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,392
Mm-hmm.

191
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,271
Grandma?
Where do you want the salad?

192
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,566
You two think you're so funny!

193
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,778
Hey, what's all this noise?

194
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:46,695
-Sorry, that was the girls.
-Hey, no running

195
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,863
in the house, girls.

196
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,201
Okay. Round up, round up.
What do we have here?

197
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:55,079
It's taller than I am!

198
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,996
Oh, my gosh!

199
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,248
I didn't get anything
for my confirmation.

200
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,458
-Dawn...
-I thought we got you

201
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,626
that nice brooch?

202
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,378
-Yeah.
-Oh, yeah...

203
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,837
Yeah, there was that.

204
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,547
-Go on, open it.
-Okay.

205
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,642
It's a mirror.

206
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,313
It's got a crack.

207
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:22,773
-Oh, Heather...
-Oh, sweetie,

208
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,942
Grandpa can fix the glass.

209
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,861
We found it at the swap meet,
over in Bucks County.

210
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,238
-Simon, hush!
-You did?

211
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,199
Hey...

212
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,369
I love it.

213
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,079
Thanks, Grandpa.

214
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,373
-Oh, honey, you're welcome.
-Thanks, Gran.

215
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,458
Oh, sweetheart!

216
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,628
-Mom, I hope it wasn't too much.
-Oh, don't worry.

217
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,463
The man couldn't get it
back in his truck,

218
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,424
so he gave us a little deal.

219
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,260
I think
it was just waiting for us.

220
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,761
We know the bathroom
gets crowded.

221
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:53,762
You can put it in your room,

222
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,889
and you don't have to share
with anyone.

223
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,057
-That's a good idea.
-That is not going

224
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,600
-in our bedroom.
-Well, I...

225
00:16:58,642 --> 00:16:59,518
-Are you serious?
-...think it's lovely...

226
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,020
...and very thoughtful.

227
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,062
No more queues.

228
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,689
Doesn't the one up at the top

229
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,065
look just like you
when you were a baby?

230
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,775
Oh, yeah, definitely.

231
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,860
I can see that.

232
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,153
Ow!

233
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,988
-Heather!
-My foot slipped.

234
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,823
It did not. I saw that.

235
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,116
-Okay, seriously, though.
-Dawn's foot got in the way.

236
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,659
Not now. Right...

237
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,161
That resemblance is crazy.

238
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:18,746
You've got the bangs

239
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,664
-and everything.
-Who wants cake?

240
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,583
I do! I do! I do!

241
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,920
Okay!

242
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,298
-Come on. There we go!
-There we go!

243
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,216
It looks so good.

244
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,887
Confirmation cake!

245
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,264
Congratulations,
sweetheart.

246
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,599
Thank you.

247
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,142
I definitely didn't get a cake.

248
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,185
Don't forget to make a wish.

249
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,311
Simon, hush!

250
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,353
Simon wants some cake, too.

251
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:44,730
Here we go!

252
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,939
Ready?

253
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,277
Hey, what?
She blew out my candles.

254
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,154
-Who?
-Dawn!

255
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,114
-No, I didn't!
-You did!

256
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,824
-No, I didn't!
-Get some light on.

257
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:56,617
It's all right.

258
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,161
I actually didn't
blow them out.

259
00:17:59,203 --> 00:17:59,536
It's okay, guys. Come on,
let's have a bit of peace.

260
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,412
She did.

261
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,790
Oh, my God!

262
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,041
Heather! Oh, my God!

263
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,043
Heather! Are you okay?

264
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,336
It's okay. What's wrong?

265
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,255
Oh, my God.
Dad? That is a lot of blood.

266
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,423
Did it hit you?

267
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,675
Oh, my God, are you hurt?

268
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,927
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

269
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,637
Just squeeze my hand.
It's okay. It's okay.

270
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,263
I'll go
and get the first aid kit!

271
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,973
The young occupants
of the apartment

272
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,891
thought they were speaking
to the spirit

273
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,144
of a little girl
named Annabelle Mullins.

274
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,562
But in reality,

275
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,772
they were communing
with an inhuman spirit.

276
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,107
A demon.

277
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,359
It played on their sympathies.

278
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,570
It played on their compassion.

279
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,824
It then asked for permission
to enter the doll as its vessel,

280
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,201
a conduit into our world.

281
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,453
We've encountered hundreds
of items like Annabelle.

282
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,749
Cursed objects, totems...

283
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,168
...and over the years,
we've found that

284
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,253
the best solution
was to collect them.

285
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,255
It's like taking guns
off the streets.

286
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,591
Hang on, sorry.

287
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,304
You know what?

288
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,763
Will one of you hit the lights?

289
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,810
All right.

290
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,396
Okay. Uh, any questions?

291
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,065
Yes?

292
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,152
So, you guys were
kind of like The Ghostbusters?

293
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,071
Uh, no. We didn't...
bust ghosts.

294
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,240
But we did see the movie.

295
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,618
Wait! So, you never got slimed?

296
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,994
Please...

297
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,330
Any serious questions?

298
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,040
Yes?

299
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,416
Why did you stop?

300
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,460
We haven't stopped.

301
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,629
We're travelling,
we're doing lectures.

302
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,005
We may even write a book.

303
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,841
But you're not taking cases
anymore.

304
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,469
Well, we've decided to, um,

305
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,387
to focus on other parts
of our life.

306
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,597
Mm.

307
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,182
Let's get out of here.

308
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,935
"Who ya gonna call?"

309
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,482
Well... thank you.

310
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,281
Our entire life's work...

311
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,576
It's like some sort of
Saturday Night Live skit.

312
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,245
Wha-- It's not funny!

313
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,288
Dad, it wasn't that bad!

314
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:54,002
Hon, I think you're not seeing
the forest for the trees.

315
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,880
Or the ghosts for the graveyard.

316
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,465
Oh, great.

317
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,176
People weren't even listening,
though.

318
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,303
They're not even
engaged anymore.

319
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,139
It's like they're just all
waiting for a punchline.

320
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,226
They're just having fun.

321
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,270
I guess.

322
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,731
When they asked
why you guys quit,

323
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,733
why didn't you just say,
'cause of your heart?

324
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,196
Because that's what
an old man would say.

325
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,826
Besides, it-it's more a hiatus
than retirement.

326
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,662
It's... It's just until
the doc clears me again.

327
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,788
Right, hon?

328
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,461
Well, in the meantime,
we have your birthday coming up.

329
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,839
-Mm-hmm.
-And I was thinking

330
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,340
of bringing Tony to the party.

331
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,091
Who's Tony?

332
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,176
Dad! We've been dating
for six months.

333
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,720
Oh, that Tony.

334
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,680
You're not funny.

335
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,266
Of course, sweetheart.
We love him.

336
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,019
-We do?
-Ed.

337
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,478
-We do.
-You guys ready?

338
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,980
-Yeah.
-Yes.

339
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,357
I'll have
the linguine with clams, please.

340
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,067
-Yeah, great choice.
-Okay.

341
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,986
Who's next?

342
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,656
Uh, yeah, I can do it.

343
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,907
Um...

344
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,745
Boy, you got
a lot of good stuff here. Um...

345
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,414
I'm on
a bit of a heart healthy diet...

Grilled steak slices...

357
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,992
...over mixed greens.
Let's do that.

358
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,079
Can I get that but with chicken?

359
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,913
Sure.

360
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,915
Dressing on the side?

361
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:02,798
Lorraine?

362
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,468
Ma'am? You okay?

363
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:07,844
Yes.

364
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,638
Yes, I'm-- I'm--

365
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,973
I'm fine. I thought--
I thought I saw something.

366
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,392
I'm fine.

367
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:15,977
Did you make up your mind?

368
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,856
-Sorry. What?
-The lasagna.

369
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,608
She loves the lasagna.

370
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:22,943
Right, sweetheart?

371
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,612
Yeah, great choice. Thank you.

372
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,530
Thank you.

373
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,448
Nice. It's coming right up.

374
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,825
You two all right?

375
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,577
Yeah.

376
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,626
Wish I could have lasagna.

377
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,730
Mommy, Mommy!

378
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,736
Mommy, Mommy!

379
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,531
What are you doing in here?

380
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,200
Mom--

381
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,105
Janet...

382
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,404
No.

383
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,614
No, that's what
Margie was saying.

384
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,823
Wait! We're gonna be late

385
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,534
for Mister Pinky Pop's
birthday party.

386
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,826
I knew that
they were having problems,

387
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,119
I just didn't know
it was that bad.

388
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,746
Hurry up, Shannon!

389
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,414
He's gonna be

390
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,250
-really mad if you're late.
-What a shame.

391
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,962
Come on!

392
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,381
No.

393
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,093
Girls, stop it!

394
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:03,937
No.

395
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,565
I don't think that that's true.

396
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,069
Alice wouldn't want that.

397
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,405
Known her
since we were in high school.

398
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:15,782
No.

399
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,951
She didn't say that, no.

400
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,744
Girls!

401
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,125
Girls, you come outta there,
right now!

402
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,090
Janet, are you there?

403
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,802
Did I lose ya?

404
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,683
Janet?

405
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,107
Hello?

406
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,372
Here you go.

407
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,416
You want some soup?

408
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,003
'Kay, Susie, I'm gonna
make you some soup,

409
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,963
and I'll be right back with you.

410
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,381
"Okay!"

411
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,675
You can.

412
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,136
So, here, it says "welcome." Oh.

413
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,846
Here's corn.

414
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,973
Can you make that carrot soup
that we like?

415
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,224
Of course!

416
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,060
-And when do you want this?
-Okay, perfect!

417
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,936
Okay, made your soup for you,
Susie.

418
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,567
Where's Susie?

419
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:40,950
Mommy, Mommy!

420
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,621
Mommy, Mommy!

421
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,043
Mommy, Mommy!

422
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,087
How did you get in here, Susie?

423
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,177
Mommy! Mommy!

424
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,286
Mommy!

425
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,931
Hey, hey, hey...

426
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,350
-Come here, come here!
-She stole my doll.

427
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,643
-You have a good day?
-She stole Susie!

428
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,602
You been a good boy?

429
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:50,729
Good boy.

430
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,604
Hey, Dad.

431
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,982
-What are you watching?
-Hi, son.

432
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,191
-It's not very good.
-Mommy! Mom, she stole my doll!

433
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,776
-Hello, everyone!
-She stole Susie!

434
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,194
Hi, sweetie.

435
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,863
-Okay.
-Could you get

436
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,656
the cutlery out over there?

437
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,658
Daddy, no one believes me!

438
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,451
-What?
-Sorry, Mom.

439
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,244
She's speaking nonsense!

440
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,163
-Believes you what?
-I'm not!

441
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,123
I'll believe you. You just
tell me what this is about.

442
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,000
-I was playing in Dawn's room...
-Thank you for the floodlights.

443
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,002
-...with Susie, and then--
-Shannon! She thinks she saw...

444
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,754
-No one believes me, Granddad!
-...an old woman in Dawn's room.

445
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:16,963
-Yeah, I believe you!
-Okay.

446
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:18,923
-That's everything. Sit down.
-An old lady took Susie.

447
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,259
-I was at the store.
-Simon believes you.

448
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,677
Simon believes...

449
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,804
-Grandma, stop scaring Carin.
-Come on, sit down.

450
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,973
All right, everyone.
I am hungry. Let's eat.

451
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,017
-Why does no one believe me?
-I'll believe you.

452
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,477
You can tell me
all about it after dinner.

453
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,644
Please sit down,
sweetheart.

454
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,813
-All right.
-Squeeze in, Carin.

455
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:34,481
-Come on, sit down.
-Maybe it was Grandma.

456
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,690
All right!

457
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,275
Okay.

458
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,945
For what we're about to receive,

459
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,406
may the Lord
make us truly thankful.

460
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:44,783
-Amen.
-Amen.

461
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:45,700
-Amen.
-Amen.

462
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,577
All right, let's eat.

463
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,954
-This looks great!
-I want some meatballs!

464
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,664
Meatballs are my favorite.

465
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,435
-It's so weird.
-I know you are.

466
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,106
Wait, what's weird?

467
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,318
The mirror.

468
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,654
Ugh, I know.

469
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,990
It's like those creepy-looking
babies are always watching me.

470
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,868
Well, babies are perverts.
Babies are gross.

471
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,120
Seriously.

472
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,961
"The one in the middle
looks just like you, Heather."

473
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,422
That was so funny,
but that's a lie.

474
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,882
You were a much uglier baby.

475
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:43,967
Jeez, thanks.

476
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,135
You know,
you should've seen the cards

477
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,720
Mom and Dad got in the hospital.

478
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,349
"Janet, we're so sorry
your daughter came out

479
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,101
looking like that guy Sloth
from Goonies."

480
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,310
You're an asshole!

481
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:06,990
You know,

482
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,617
it's trash day tomorrow.

483
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,547
Ow.

484
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,106
Let's take it 'round the bend.

485
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,321
Oh, my God, that was so heavy!

486
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,281
What if Grandma asks about it?

487
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,575
It was the twins. They did it.

488
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,952
They broke it.
We just took it outside.

489
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,120
Good idea.

490
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,289
I know. I'm a genius.

491
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,672
Morning, everyone. Carin!

492
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,257
Get down from there.
What's she doing?

493
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,134
-Stay. Simon, stay. Simon, go!
-Carin, come on down.

494
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,511
Carin, come on now. Sit down.

495
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,180
-Making me some sandwiches?
-Honey,

496
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,765
I am making the girls
some sandwiches.

497
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:15,516
-What about my lunch?
-I've got your lunch.

498
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,101
"Win a family vacation
to Florida."

499
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,312
-Oh, my gosh!
-How cool would that be?

500
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,188
Pretty cool.

501
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,232
-You really stink, Simon.
-He's farting all the time, now.

502
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,233
That's the bacon.

503
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,319
-I don't really...
-No!

504
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,196
Don't slap me with cheese.
You know what happened,

505
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,864
the last time
you slapped me with cheese?

506
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,991
-What?
-I was down on my knees. Mm-mm!

507
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,709
I got it.

508
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,716
-Get the other end of this?
-Yep.

509
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,307
-You ready?
-It'll fit.

510
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,439
Yeah,
I don't own a piggy bank.

511
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,983
I don't have two dollars.

512
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,778
I don't have one.
It's just a prank.

513
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,784
Yeah, maybe we'll have
two dollars.

514
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,785
Four dollars!

515
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,245
Yeah, that would be good.

516
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,330
Well, you have a birthday
coming up soon.

517
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,467
Are you okay?

518
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,804
-Dawn?
-Sweetheart?

519
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,681
Are you okay?

520
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,391
-Honey?
-Come on.

521
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,600
-You okay, Dawn?
-Dawn?

522
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,853
Mm! Mm...

523
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,814
Dawn, can you breathe okay?

524
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,607
-Are you choking?
-Are you choking, sweetheart?

525
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,986
Oh, God! Oh, Dawn!

526
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,905
Honey. Oh, my gosh.

527
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,074
Oh, my God, no!

528
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,826
-You'll be okay.
-Oh, my God.

529
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,039
-Oh, Dawn!
-Oh, Dawny!

530
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,665
Oh, my God!

531
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,584
Dawn!

532
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,087
It's okay.

533
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,589
What is that?

534
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,883
Is that glass?
Did you swallow glass?

535
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,342
We've gotta
get to the hospital.

536
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,677
-Yes.
-Go!

537
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:15,845
Get her to the hospital!

538
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,513
God, Jack!

539
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:20,725
It's gonna be all right.

540
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,642
Yeah, yeah, it will.

541
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,352
-It's gonna be okay.
-Sweetheart,

542
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,979
come and sit down, sweetie.

543
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,022
Heather, sweetheart.

544
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,231
Come on.

545
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:36,783
That bad?

546
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,494
Higher than I'd like.

547
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,038
You ever think about adding fish
to your diet?

548
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,248
I'm not really a fish guy, doc.

549
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,291
What about egg whites?

550
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:46,584
Egg what?

551
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,216
Ed...

552
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,136
I've known you a long time.
Cut the crap.

553
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:58,888
Excuse me?

554
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,516
You can't have
another heart attack.

555
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:07,980
Yeah.

-Hi, it's good to see you.
-How are you?

560
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,455
Lorraine, good to see you.

561
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,207
Look, help yourself
to the hors d'oeuvres.

562
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,500
I'll be right out.

563
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:31,504
Okay.

564
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:36,801
Okay...

565
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,684
-What was that for?
-Just...

566
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:48,146
...to thank you
for this wonderful party.

00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,858
All my favorite people

568
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,277
...here.

569
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,363
Happy birthday, Ed.

570
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,745
Uh-- She's here.

571
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,128
Okay.

572
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,340
Tony, you're acting so nervous!

573
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,633
What? I'm not nervous.

574
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:22,680
I just really
want them to approve.

575
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,473
Of what?

576
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,102
I don't know.
Uh, you know, me, us.

577
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,188
You've got nothing
to worry about.

578
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,523
My mom loves you.

579
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,277
What about your dad?

580
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,489
Your dad doesn't like me?

581
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,949
-Stop!
-Are you serious?

582
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,660
-You're telling me this now?
-I didn't say that! Come on.

583
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,955
What's with the tie?
It's not a funeral.

584
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,415
So now I'm
not even dressed right.

585
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,791
Oh, my God.

586
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,003
All right. Where are we?

587
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,421
Is she here?

588
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,256
-Oh! Aw...
-Happy birthday, Dad!

589
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,966
-Thank you, sweetie.
-Hey, Mom.

590
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,594
-Tommy?
-Dad, it's Tony!

591
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,304
-That's what I said.
-Happy birthday, Mr. Warren.

592
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,723
-Thank you.
-Tony, you look so handsome.

593
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,350
Oh, please, come on in.

594
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,185
Hey, what's with the tie?
It's not a funeral.

595
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,105
What?

596
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,569
Judy?

597
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,697
-Father Gordon. Hi!
-Oh, my goodness!

598
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,783
It's so good to see you.

599
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,577
-Honey?
-You have gotten taller.

600
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,205
He always says that.

601
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,041
Um, this is my boyfriend, Tony.

602
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,461
Tony, this is my Father Gordon.

603
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,506
He used to work
with my mom and dad.

604
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,508
-It's nice to meet you, Tony.
-And you.

605
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,885
So, what do you do?

606
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,430
Oh, uh...
I am between jobs, actually.

607
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,598
Oh, okay.

608
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,141
Tony was a police officer.

609
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,227
Call it early retirement.

610
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,688
You're quite young
for retirement, son.

611
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:54,814
Huh?

612
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,566
Yeah, it's, uh...

613
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,859
It's a long story.

614
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,905
All right. Be careful
not to touch anything.

615
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:07,868
So, everything you see in there
is either haunted, cursed,

616
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,079
or has been used
in some sort of, uh...

617
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,665
ritualistic practice.

618
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,002
What's in there?

619
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,462
All the skeletons.

620
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,090
What? Wait, really?

621
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,634
Baby, hand me my beer.

622
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:26,887
Thank you.

623
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,021
Maybe one more?

624
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,983
Hey.

625
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,860
Smells good.

626
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,948
S-Sorry, uh, I'm Tony.

627
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,200
I know who you are.

628
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,453
You're Judy's boyfriend.

629
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,121
Yeah.

630
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,623
Brad Hamilton.
I used to work with the Warrens.

631
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,208
Oh...

632
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,003
What, like,
on their investigations?

633
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,296
Here and there, yeah.

634
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,884
Sometimes consulting,
sometimes... security.

635
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,638
Hey, did you ever
see an exorcism?

636
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,265
Did I ever see an exorcism?

637
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,310
Did I ever see an exorcism?

638
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,232
Front row, baby. Right there.

639
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,360
That's a battle scar.

640
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,487
She nearly bit off
my entire cheek.

641
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,446
She did that?

642
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,491
Yeah. And they say
Rhode Island's boring.

643
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,702
I don't know.

Okay. Um, how did it go again?

00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,695
No, seriously. Teach me.

671
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:12,947

Tony, Ed was looking for you.

699
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,974
He's taking some of the guys
to the garage.

700
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,270
Oh, so... Like, me?

701
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,564
Yes, if-- if you want.

702
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:31,108
Uh, yeah. Sure.

703
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,907
I should probably...

704
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,076
Judy, wait.

705
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:51,629
What's going on?

706
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,466
Nothing. I'm fine.

707
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,427
The other night,
at the restaurant?

708
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,762
It was nothing.

709
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,184
You're seeing things
more often now, aren't you?

710
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:08,437
No.

711
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,025
Do you remember
what we practiced?

712
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,110
I can handle it.

713
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:19,156
You can't. Judy, you can't.
You need to shut it out.

714
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:23,410
Trust me, after a lifetime
of this, I promise you,

715
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,412
you don't want it.

716
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,915
I got it.

717
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,460
I love you.

718
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,423
I love you too, Mom.

719
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,142
Should we go rescue Tony
from your father?

720
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,061
Please.

721
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,397
Thanks for the encouragement.

722
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,024
There's a nice bounce!

723
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,275
Come on, Drew, you got this.

724
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:57,111
Get him. Get him.

725
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,654
Oh!

726
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,074
Tony! You're up.

727
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:04,743
Sure.

728
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,203
-All good?
-Yeah.

729
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,204
Good luck, buddy.

730
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,550
-All right.
-Jacket off!

731
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,135
-The jacket. I got it.
-Okay!

732
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,886
-Ready?
-Yeah.

733
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:23,929
You need to hop around
a little more?

734
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,390
-No, I'm good, sir. I'm good.
-All right. Here we go. Ready?

735
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,726
♪ Let's play ♪

736
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,310
Whoa!

737
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,231
-One more.
-All right.

738
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:36,942
♪ Let's sway ♪

739
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:42,531

The serious moonlight ♪

00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,076
Oh!

741
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,041
Twenty-one, eighteen!

742
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,835
Good game.

743
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,087
Tough luck, Tony.
Almost thought you had a chance.

744
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:58,464
-Congratulations.
-Oh, man.

745
00:45:58,505 --> 00:45:59,798
-That was so good.
-Nice job.

746
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,341
-We got a winner.
-Why did I hit it?

747
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,260
Sorry.

748
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,054
You okay?

749
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,473
Yeah.

750
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,682
Still undefeated.

751
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,642
I'm gonna get another drink.

752
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,936
Oh, I'll come. Uh,
Mom, Dad, you want something?

753
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,605
-No, thank you, sweetheart.
-You good?

754
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:15,981
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

755
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,233
We have beers?

756
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:21,069
-Yeah.
-Whoo.

757
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,613
Don't think I didn't notice.

758
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,573
-It's spick and span.
-I'm trying.

759
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:25,741
-Yeah.
-This is, uh...

760
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,409
Sorry to interrupt. Um...

761
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:31,038
Actually, I, um... You know,
I was hoping to say something?

762
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,498
Sure. What's on your mind?

763
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,042
Yeah, well, um...

764
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,421
You know, it's good
that Judy's gone, 'cause

765
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,840
what I wanted to say was, um...

766
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,180
I'm just gonna...

767
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:50,557
Uh...

768
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,810
So...

769
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,317
I bought this
a week after I met her.

770
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,196
Soon, I know,

771
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,406
and I know we've only been
dating for six months,

772
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:07,741
but...

773
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,203
You know,
when you know, you know.

774
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,289
And I-I just-- I can't imagine
my life without her.

775
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:16,917
So...

776
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,628
what I'm trying to say is,
I-I...

777
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,965
I would love
to have your blessing.

778
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,555
It's beautiful, Tony.

779
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,369
You do know...

780
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:56,874
...that our family
is not like other families?

781
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:04,882
And Judy, um...

782
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,388
...she's our little girl.

783
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:16,810
And, um, you know, you're right,
it has been a very short time.

784
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:21,523
But we barely knew each other
when we got engaged.

785
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,275
-Well--
-Ed was shipping out.

786
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,986
But I think that...
I don't know,

787
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,322
I think that we just knew.

788
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:32,743
Mm-hmm.

789
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,538
Of course,
you have our blessing.

790
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,125
Mr. Warren?

791
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,543
Yeah, um...

792
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,590
Tony, um... You're a good kid...

793
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,633
Ed...

794
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,344
And... Well, they've only known
each other six months.

795
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:51,720
Don't be silly.

796
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,305
But she just said
that you guys--

797
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,348
-Yeah, well, that...
-Yeah...

798
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,183
...was a-a different time.

799
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,102
Okay, um...

800
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,314
Maybe this was too early?

801
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,024
-Yeah, there we go.
-No.

802
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,944
So, I will come back
in a month and--

803
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,028
A month?

804
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:09,738
Ed...

805
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,242
What is that?

806
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,245
-Sh...
-Oh.

807
00:49:26,546 --> 00:49:27,839
Is that for me?

808
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:39,726
Yes.

809
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,438
-Judy, I was asking--
-Yes!

810
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:47,317
Yes! Obviously, yes!

811
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:49,987
Yes!

812
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,575
It's beautiful.

813
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,745
Is this why
you were so nervous in the car?

814
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,372
Sure was.

815
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,834
-Did you see it?
-I did! I did.

816
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,043
It's so pretty.

817
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,962
-Oh, honey.
-Thank you, sir.

818
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,797
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

819
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,048
So pretty.

820
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:12,926
-You happy?
-Yeah.

821
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,095
-Congrats, Tony.
-Thanks, man.

822
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,556
You know, Tony,
he seems like a good egg.

823
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,516
Yeah, yeah...

824
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,270
Judy's got good instincts.

825
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:26,898
You just, have to let her go,
let her walk her own path.

826
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,233
Yeah.

827
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,652
Oh, uh, by the way...

828
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,488
we've had a couple calls.

829
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,408
Some families reaching out.
They could use your...

830
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,578
special assistance.

831
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:40,704
So, what are we talking about?
Are they local, or--

832
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:41,788
Ed.

833
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,207
Yeah.

834
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,335
We're sorry, Father.
Those days are behind us now.

835
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,504
I know. I guess I just--

836
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,007
I just had to try.

837
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,259
-For old times' sake.
-Sure.

838
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,345
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

839
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:58,889
You look good for an old guy.

840
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,085
We're just gonna pretend,
like nothing's going on?

841
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,796
Father Jensen has submitted
our case to the archdiocese.

842
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,464
And so what?

843
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,925
You're just gonna let us
live in a haunted house?

844
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,218
Don't talk to your father
like that!

845
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:37,719
It's all right, I got this, Mom.

846
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,305
Just, please, stop fighting!

847
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,807
Oh, honey...

848
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,225
It's okay, honey.

849
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,393
Please, Dad,
can't we got to a motel?

850
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:48,355
There's eight of us, sweetie.
We can't afford that.

851
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,273
As I was saying,
Father Jensen has said--

852
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,566
"Father Jensen says."

853
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,902
-God, I've heard that before.
-The church has a process.

854
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:57,114
They work with people
who come and document...

855
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:58,990
these things.

856
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,033
"These things?"

857
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,785
To prove it's all real!

858
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,037
"To prove it's all real?"

859
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,248
It's real!

860
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,083
-It wants to kill us!
-No, no.

861
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,209
No, it does!

862
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:16,216
You-- You don't believe us,
do you?

863
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,425
-No, no. Dawn,
-Do you?

864
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,970
-that is not what I am saying.
-No, you don't believe us.

865
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,388
-That is not what I'm saying!
-You don't believe us,

866
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,389
just 'cause
it hasn't happened to you.

867
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,807
It's happening to all of us!

868
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:26,601
Not the same way
it's happened to me, Dad!

869
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,604
I cannot live like this anymore.
None of us can!

870
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,482
Either you don't believe us,

871
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,318
or you can't do anything
about it. Which is it?

872
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,700
-Jesus fucking Christ...
-Dawn...

873
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:42,826
-Hey!
-No, no.

874
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:44,578
-I'm not gonna wait. Don't.
-Just leave it. No, no. Hon...

875
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,163
Oh, no. Dawn. Come...

876
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:05,844
...got you that nice brooch?

877
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:07,846
-Yeah.
-Oh... yeah.

878
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,514
-Go on, open it.
-Okay.

879
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,765
-Go on!
-I'm excited to see what it is.

880
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,392
Oh, the tension!

881
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,980
Oh, my God!

882
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,481
It's kinda weird.

883
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,986
Thanks, Grandpa.

884
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,321
You're welcome, honey.

885
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,572
Thanks, Grandma.

886
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,117
...cake!

887
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,453
Are you excited
for your cake, Heather?

888
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,413
Simon wants some cake, too.

889
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,789
-Here we go!
-Yeah!

890
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:35,874
Ready?

891
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:40,378
Hey,
she blew out my candle.

892
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,880
-Who?
-Dawn!

893
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,506
-Oh.
-I did not!

894
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,759
You did.

895
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:49,888
Here we go!

896
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:51,014
Ready?

897
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:55,352
Hey, she blew--

898
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,395
What was that?

899
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,776
Simon wants some cake, too.

900
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,110
-Here we go!
-Yeah!

901
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,362
Ready?

902
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,160
-Here we go!
-Yeah!

903
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,411
Ready?

904
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,503
-Here we go!
-Yeah!

905
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,379
Ready?

906
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:27,092
Hey,
she blew out my candle.

907
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,054
Simon wants some cake, too.

908
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,430
-Here we go!
-Yeah!

909
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:33,431
Ready?

910
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:03,044
Dad.

911
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:57,098
Jack! Jack!

912
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,435
Jack. Jack. Jack.

913
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,270
The girls!

914
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:06,566
God!

915
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,612
Oh, my God. Heather.

916
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:13,531
Baby, what happened?
What happened?

917
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:16,701
Someone's here! Someone's here!

918
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,831
No one's here, honey.
No one's here!

919
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,335
-He's in here!
-Heather! Poor, baby.

920
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,506
We can't live like this, Jack!

921
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,591
We need to do something!

922
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,886
Oh, poor Heather!

923
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,062
The devil has come
to Pennsylvania.

924
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:47,065
In the coal mining hills
of West Pittston,

925
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:50,318
this family is under siege
by the supernatural.

926
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,861
This is my parents and, um...

927
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:53,947
We had quite a bit
of disturbance

928
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,199
-in through the kitchen there...
-Jack and Janet Smurl...

929
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,617
-...from the ceiling.
-...claim that an evil presence

930
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,536
has found its way
into their home.

931
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:01,246
Curiosity seekers,
those that believe,

932
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,789
and those that do not,
lined Chase Street,

933
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,165
Wednesday,
to see the haunted house.

934
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,542
We're live in three, two...

935
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,711
Welcome to Larry King Live!

936
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:10,004
Good evening,
on this Monday night.

937
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,048
Cast out, ye evil demons!

938
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:15,343
Our guests, to begin things,
are Janet and Jack Smurl.

939
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,136
Do you guess, haunted by what?

940
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:19,180
We didn't guess
by anything, Larry.

941
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,474
See, we weren't thinking
in terms of supernatural,

942
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:22,517
I mean, nobody does.

943
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,602
Jack Smurl says that a demon

944
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,312
assaulted him
in the middle of the night,

945
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,855
-paralyzing his body.
-It woke my wife,

946
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,148
and then there was screaming.

947
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:32,443
Is this really a haunting,
or is this some elaborate hoax?

948
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,279
Eight people live in this house,

949
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,948
eight people
have experienced this.

950
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,159
Eight people are not crazy.

951
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:43,913
We're asking... for help.

952
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,373
-Someone, anyone, help us.
-Maureen.

953
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,916
Oh, my gosh!

954
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:49,210
-It's little Judy Warren!
-Hey, Brenda.

955
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,879
You brought your mom, too.

956
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,298
-Our local celebrity.
-Thank you.

957
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,008
Oh, Brenda... How's your family?

958
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:56,926
Oh, good, good, good.

959
00:59:56,968 --> 01:00:00,805
You know, maybe when we're done,
you can tell me my future?

960
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,765
I'm kidding,
I know that's not your thing!

961
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:04,642
You've got
your investigations and all.

962
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,603
-Well, not anymore.
-Okay. So, Mrs. Warren,

963
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,146
Maureen'll get you
a coffee or something.

964
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:09,564
And sweetie, I'll take you back.

965
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,190
We'll try on
that beautiful dress!

966
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,950
Wish I could meet
a guy like Tony.

967
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,535
-What about Dom?
-Ugh.

968
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,121
We broke up. Again.

969
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:28,458
I'm sorry. There's plenty
more fish in the sea.

970
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:29,959
You're very sweet.

971
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,169
You were too pretty for him,
anyway.

972
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:32,545
Stop!

973
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,672
-Ow!
-Oh, I'm so sorry!

974
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,049
Looks like I nicked you there.

975
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,968
Yeah.

976
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:40,345
Maureen?

977
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,599
You gonna get that?

978
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,978
That girl's an idiot.
I'll be right back.

979
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:00,633
I was starting to get
really claustrophobic.

980
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:08,850
Brenda?

981
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,068
You okay down there, Brenda?

982
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:22,071
Ow.

983
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:30,872
Brenda?

What happened?

It's okay.

994

Mr. Smurl. Mr. Smurl.

995
01:03:59,001 --> 01:03:59,919
-Careful.
-Jack.

996
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,128
Can you back off, please?

997
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:02,672
What's going on in your house?

01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:03,589

Please, have some respect!

1000
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:07,051
-Out of respect for my mother.
-Please, back off!

1001
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:09,011
-Give us space, please!
-Is she okay?

1002
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,137
For heaven's sake,
outta my face!

1003
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,347
Careful.

1004
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:13,307
-Go away!
-You'll be okay, Mom.

1005
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,309
Kids, Grandma's gonna be fine,
don't worry.

1006
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:16,686
Dawn, look after your mother.

1007
01:04:16,727 --> 01:04:18,479
Can you get out of my--

1008
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:19,438
-Jack, I'll see you there, okay?
-See you at the hospital.

1009
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,065
I'm gonna go with Ma.

1010
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,692
-We'll be in touch, sweetie.
-Yeah.

1011
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:24,569
Why won't it stop?

1012
01:04:24,610 --> 01:04:25,653
Mom, look.

1013
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,252
Yes.

1014
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:45,172
-That's Simon.
-Oh, hey, Simon.

1015
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:47,508
I grew up with a dog like this.

1016
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,677
-Oh, you did?
-Yeah.

1017
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,306
Th-- That ambulance out there...

1018
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:55,516
...who was that?

1019
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,813
It's my mother-in-law.

1020
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,066
Some...

1021
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:08,654
Something pushed her
down the stairs.

1022
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:11,282
It's getting worse.

1023
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:12,825
And we can't afford to leave.

1024
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,373
I'm so glad that you're here.

1025
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:21,876
We really thought that

1026
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,711
the church
had forgotten about us.

1027
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:26,756
Mrs. Smurl, uh...

1028
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:31,052
The church
doesn't know I'm here.

1029
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,095
I'm actually from Connecticut.

1030
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:36,182
But I have worked
with cases similar to yours,

1031
01:05:36,223 --> 01:05:39,226
and I have been following
your story

1032
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:40,811
very closely on the news.

1033
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,731
I thought
I might be able to help.

1034
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:50,446
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

1035
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:56,494
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

1036
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:01,666
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

1037
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:36,534
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

1038
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:48,963
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

1039
01:06:56,303 --> 01:07:00,433
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

1040
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:17,241
What happened down there?

1041
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:18,492
Something's here.

1042
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,327
You're leaving?

1043
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:24,498
We are gonna help you.

1044
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,333
The church will listen to me.

1045
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,920
I promise you, they'll listen.

1046
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:13,672
Can I help you?

1047
01:08:13,714 --> 01:08:15,132
Bishop McKenna, please.

1048
01:08:15,716 --> 01:08:17,468
Of course. And you are?

1049
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,803
Father Gordon.

1050
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:19,887
One minute.

1051
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:25,768
I have a Father Gordon.

1052
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:29,438
-This is regarding?
-The Smurls.

1053
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,649
They're a family
from West Pittston.

1054
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:32,942
It's urgent.

1055
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:37,446
He's here about a family
from West Pittston.

1056
01:08:37,488 --> 01:08:38,656
He says it's urgent.

1057
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,034
All right.

1058
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:45,746
He'll just be one moment.

1059
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:10,646
Father? Are you all right?

1060
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,606
Yes, I'm...

1061
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:13,858
I'm sorry.

1062
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,051
Hel-- Hello?

1063
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,747
Father Gordon?

1064
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:12,374
-Judy?
-You can go now.

1065
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:56,752
I am protected by God Almighty,

1066
01:10:58,545 --> 01:11:02,758
maker of heaven and Earth,
of all that is seen and unseen.

1067
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,387
My faith is my armor.

1068
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,055
God's light...

1069
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:12,434
God protect me!

1070
01:11:39,503 --> 01:11:40,671
There she is!

1071
01:11:41,588 --> 01:11:44,049
See, you've always gotta check
if she's got a spark.

1072
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:45,676
Ah.

1073
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:49,054
Kept thinking
it was the carburetor.

1074
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:50,764
Should have checked
the spark plug.

1075
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:54,184
Nice work.

1076
01:11:54,226 --> 01:11:55,644
Well, you know, I, uh,

1077
01:11:55,686 --> 01:11:56,895
I couldn't afford
a mechanic in college,

1078
01:11:56,937 --> 01:11:58,439
so I had to teach myself.

1079
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,986
Hey, how much has Judy told you
about what we do?

1080
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:07,740
Enough to not ask
many questions.

1081
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:13,287
Come inside.
I wanna show you something.

1082
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:18,375
Don't touch anything.

1083
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:24,298
Everything you see in here
is either haunted, cursed,

1084
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,176
or been used in some
sort of ritualistic practice.

1085
01:12:29,261 --> 01:12:30,637
Nothing's a toy.

1086
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:33,307
Not even the toys.

1087
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:39,980
If all these things are so evil,

1088
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:42,649
why do you keep them around?

1089
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,568
Why not just destroy them?

1090
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:48,072
It's complicated. Sometimes
that makes things worse.

1091
01:12:48,572 --> 01:12:51,784
Sometimes...
they just won't let you.

1092
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:55,496
We've found it safer
to keep the genie in the bottle.

1093
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:58,374
It's better in here
than out there.

1094
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,793
How many cases you guys had?

1095
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:02,503
Cases? Oh.

1096
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:04,671
Maybe a thousand?

1097
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:06,090
A thousand?

1098
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:10,511
Yeah, well. We started young,
about your age.

1099
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:15,265
Mmm. It's funny. This room,

1100
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:18,519
every little thing in it...

1101
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,605
...is our story.

1102
01:13:24,525 --> 01:13:26,193
It's our life's work.

1103
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,864
Listen, the other day?

1104
01:13:31,448 --> 01:13:32,699
I get it.

1105
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:38,038
Yeah I-- I was just... nervous,
and you're kinda intimidating.

1106
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:39,665
We almost lost Judy.

1107
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:43,627
She was stillborn.

1108
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:48,799
For probably a minute.

1109
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:54,721
It was the longest minute
of our lives.

1110
01:13:57,015 --> 01:14:00,436
And as a parent, that's
something you never forget.

1111
01:14:04,064 --> 01:14:05,858
So, while I know
she's your fiancée,

1112
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:09,820
for us,

1113
01:14:10,737 --> 01:14:14,950
she will always be that little
baby, fighting for her life.

1114
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,079
I understand, sir.

1115
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,333
Do you?

1116
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,216
What's wrong?

1117
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:34,178
What?

1118
01:14:35,053 --> 01:14:38,932
Father Gordon,
he was a good man.

1119
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:42,102
A man of God.

1120
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:45,731
And he helped so many people.

1121
01:14:46,648 --> 01:14:49,568
I didn't know Father
to be a man of despair.

1122
01:14:50,527 --> 01:14:53,655
No, Father Gordon was light.

1123
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:59,286
And he brought that light
to me and my family,

1124
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,788
when we needed him most.

1125
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:09,254
I only wish that...

1126
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:11,340
...we could've done
the same for him.

1127
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:24,496
Mr. Warren? Mrs. Warren?

1128
01:16:25,038 --> 01:16:26,123
Yes?

1129
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:30,335
I'm sorry, we never met.
My name is Father Ziegler.

1130
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,755
You're actually both
a bit infamous

1131
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:36,049
within certain circles
of the church.

1132
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:38,343
Yes, we're aware.

1133
01:16:38,385 --> 01:16:40,846
But Gordon always
spoke highly of you.

1134
01:16:40,887 --> 01:16:44,391
He believed in the mission.
And the things you did together.

1135
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:46,310
He considered you both friends.

1136
01:16:46,351 --> 01:16:47,519
Thank you, Father.

1137
01:16:53,233 --> 01:16:55,193
Excuse me, Father.

1138
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:56,778
Yes?

1139
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,405
Mm.

1140
01:16:59,197 --> 01:17:00,616
Where was it?

1141
01:17:01,366 --> 01:17:03,702
Where did he die?

1142
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,204
Pennsylvania.

1143
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:09,374
God only knows why
he was out there.

1144
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:49,373
What?

1145
01:18:17,818 --> 01:18:23,573
♪ Lucy Locket lost her pocket ♪

1146
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:30,080
♪ Kitty Fisher found it ♪

1147
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:53,228
Lorraine. What? What's wrong?

1148
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:58,650
It's Judy.

1149
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:00,318
There's something wrong
with Judy.

1150
01:19:08,952 --> 01:19:10,704
Where is she?

1151
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:35,520
Oh, boy.

1152
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:41,276
Ma'am,
can I ask you a few questions?

1153
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:49,326
Hey, stay back from here, okay?

1154
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:51,995
Whatever is going on
in that house,

1155
01:19:52,037 --> 01:19:54,748
we are getting Judy,
and we are taking her home.

1156
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:59,252
All right. Excuse us.

1157
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:01,338
Sorry. Excuse us.

1158
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:05,926
It's Ed and Lorraine Warren.

1159
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:08,053
Mrs. Warren,
what are you doing here?

1160
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:08,929
Mrs. Warren, have you been
called in for reinforcements?

1161
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:10,096
What's in the house?

1162
01:20:11,264 --> 01:20:13,141
Mr. Warren, will you
be performing an exorcism today?

1163
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:14,059
Excuse me.

1164
01:20:14,684 --> 01:20:16,186
Are the Smurls
hiding something?

1165
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:17,771
-Do you know the Smurls?
-Ed and Lorraine!

1166
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:18,271
Are you coming out
of retirement?

1167
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:20,023
Sir?

1168
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:22,859
-Sir, can you tell us your name?
-Hey, just back off.

1169
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:23,568
What's your connection
to the Warrens, sir?

1170
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:24,945
Ed and Lorraine...

1171
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:28,532
You okay?

1172
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,118
Mr. Smurl?

1173
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:34,246
Ed Warren.

1174
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:35,872
Uh, yeah. This is my wife.

1175
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:38,875
Lorraine. Yes, yes!
Please, come in. Please.

1176
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:41,503
Oh, thank you so much
for coming.

1177
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:44,256
We hear you're the experts.

1178
01:20:44,297 --> 01:20:46,174
People told us
you were retired.

1179
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:48,885
Well.

1180
01:20:53,765 --> 01:20:56,852
I'm so sorry.
We're looking for our daughter.

1181
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:58,687
Mom?

1182
01:20:58,728 --> 01:20:59,771
Mom?

1183
01:21:00,647 --> 01:21:03,650
Judy!

1184
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:05,902
That is Janet a-and Jack Smurl.

1185
01:21:06,486 --> 01:21:08,154
Thank God you're safe.

1186
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:12,033
What are you doing out here?
This is not like you.

1187
01:21:12,075 --> 01:21:13,493
Father Gordon was here.

1188
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,328
He came here
just before he died.

1189
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,664
I put two and two together,
and I found them.

1190
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:19,708
-It's been going on for months.
-We need to go.

1191
01:21:19,749 --> 01:21:22,335
What? No. Mom. Mom.

1192
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:24,212
I'm so sorry. Ed, we need to go.

1193
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:25,589
-You're leaving?
-Yes, we're leaving.

1194
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:26,840
Wait, what?

1195
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:28,008
Really sorry if we've intruded.

1196
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:29,467
-We can't leave!
-We can't stay.

1197
01:21:29,509 --> 01:21:30,468
-We can talk about this outside.
-Mom!

1198
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:31,511
It's been a long drive.

1199
01:21:32,095 --> 01:21:33,346
Again, we're really sorry.
Come on, Judy.

1200
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,307
-Say something.
-Stop!

1201
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:45,108
We don't run from fights, right?

1202
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:48,737
I mean, that's what
you'd always tell each other,

1203
01:21:48,778 --> 01:21:50,906
when there was a family
that needed you.

1204
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:57,454
As a kid, I didn't understand
why you had to leave.

1205
01:21:58,413 --> 01:21:59,998
Why you gave so much
of yourselves

1206
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,708
to people you didn't know.

1207
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:05,045
And even now, I don't know.

1208
01:22:07,839 --> 01:22:10,759
I don't know why I'm here,
I really don't.

1209
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:13,219
But we're all here now.

1210
01:22:14,554 --> 01:22:17,265
And they need us.

1211
01:22:28,693 --> 01:22:30,654
They need you.

1212
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:04,813
Any comments for us?

1213
01:23:05,855 --> 01:23:08,108
Mr. Warren, do
you think it's a real haunting?

1214
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:12,737
We should have never
gone to the press.

1215
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:15,240
Now our neighbors
can't stand us.

1216
01:23:15,281 --> 01:23:17,200
They think we wanted this.

1217
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:20,203
I didn't know
it was gonna turn into a circus.

1218
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:22,747
We wanted someone like you,
experts.

1219
01:23:22,789 --> 01:23:24,040
People who've dealt
with this before.

1220
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:25,291
L-Let's...

1221
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:27,460
take this back to the beginning.
When did it start?

1222
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:30,130
-Uh, Heather's confirmation.
-Yeah.

1223
01:23:30,171 --> 01:23:32,173
What do you mean,
you saw him die?

1224
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:36,302
I mean, were you here?

1225
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:39,305
No, back home. In a vision.

1226
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:41,850
But... it was different.

1227
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:42,934
Did you tell your mom?

1228
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:47,188
No. I can't talk to her anymore.
She's always so...

1229
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:49,190
-Worried.
-Yeah.

1230
01:23:50,316 --> 01:23:51,901
There's something else.

1231
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:55,196
I don't know how to say it,
but it's like...

1232
01:23:56,948 --> 01:24:01,661
...something wants me
to be here.

1233
01:24:03,246 --> 01:24:06,082
So your parents
were living here?

1234
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:07,834
Which one of you? Which parents?

1235
01:24:08,752 --> 01:24:10,295
Yeah, they've been
with us all along,

1236
01:24:10,336 --> 01:24:12,130
since we moved in, and um...

1237
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:39,884
He started making pancakes.

1238
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:48,268
So, is this, like,
a normal case?

1239
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:51,604
They're never normal.

1240
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:55,275
No, I mean, do you
always cook pancakes?

1241
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:57,694
Is that part of the process?

1242
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:06,619
Sometimes it's waffles.

1243
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:14,294
No, every case is different.

1244
01:26:14,794 --> 01:26:16,212
Every family's different.

1245
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:20,466
One thing that's always the same
is the fear.

1246
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:22,969
You can see it in their eyes.

1247
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:26,389
And a demon will prey on that.

1248
01:26:27,223 --> 01:26:29,559
It'll try to isolate them,
use their fears against them.

1249
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:31,644
So part of the job is just...

1250
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:34,856
letting them know
they're not alone.

1251
01:26:36,065 --> 01:26:37,192
Right.

1252
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:43,323
Judy told me you were a cop.

1253
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:46,242
What happened? Why'd you quit?

1254
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:47,327
It's nothing.

1255
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,295
Okay, so...

1256
01:26:58,504 --> 01:26:59,464
I was working in Bloomfield.

1257
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:03,343
You know, small town.
Nothing ever happens.

1258
01:27:04,093 --> 01:27:06,596
Me and my partner,
we get a domestic violence call.

1259
01:27:08,264 --> 01:27:12,477
And we pull up to the house,
and we hear fighting inside.

1260
01:27:12,518 --> 01:27:14,896
So, I knock on the door.

1261
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:16,981
And immediately,

1262
01:27:17,023 --> 01:27:19,234
the door flies open,

1263
01:27:19,275 --> 01:27:21,319
and this guy shoves
a twelve-gauge shotgun

1264
01:27:21,361 --> 01:27:22,528
right in my face.

1265
01:27:23,863 --> 01:27:26,282
And I hear... click.

1266
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:28,910
I, uh...

1267
01:27:29,452 --> 01:27:32,872
I unfreeze,
and, uh, we take the guy down.

1268
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:34,540
Arrest him.

1269
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:39,295
Later,
my partner comes up to me,

1270
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:42,215
and he says,
"You're a dead man."

1271
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:45,301
He shows me the shotgun.

1272
01:27:47,178 --> 01:27:48,137
It was loaded.

1273
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:51,307
Primer was struck on the shell.

1274
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:52,600
Misfire.

1275
01:27:54,811 --> 01:27:58,523
I figure,
there's a world where I'm dead.

1276
01:28:00,066 --> 01:28:02,568
Where I never grow old.

1277
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:05,321
I never have kids.

1278
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:07,949
I never get to marry
your daughter.

1279
01:28:13,579 --> 01:28:16,708
So next day, I-I quit,

1280
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:19,752
and I go out
and buy that ring for Judy.

1281
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,349
This is my
wastepaper basket, Bert.

1282
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:34,851
Of course,
it's your waste basket!

1283
01:28:34,892 --> 01:28:36,644
-Oh, yeah.
-You put it on my head!

1284
01:28:36,686 --> 01:28:38,521
-Thank you, Bert.
-"Thank you?"

1285
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:39,564
That's my wastepaper basket

1286
01:28:40,523 --> 01:28:41,899
for throwing stuff in
when I make a mistake.

1287
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:44,068
Terrific.
Okay, now, Ernie, Ernie...

1288
01:28:46,195 --> 01:28:48,323
Should we do a silly face? Yeah?

1289
01:29:03,212 --> 01:29:05,506
Sorry, the flash
was supposed to be off.

1290
01:29:08,801 --> 01:29:10,428
I just thought I could...

1291
01:29:12,221 --> 01:29:13,681
...document it all.

1292
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:19,187
Everything okay?

1293
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:21,981
Yeah.

1294
01:29:29,614 --> 01:29:33,242
I just realized, I've never
seen you guys at work.

1295
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:46,756
I feel it, too.

1296
01:29:55,681 --> 01:29:57,392
Stay here.

1297
01:29:57,433 --> 01:30:00,061
-Mom, I can help.
-Judy, you promised.

1298
01:30:17,537 --> 01:30:18,955
Mommy, Mommy!

1299
01:30:25,628 --> 01:30:27,046
Mommy, Mommy!

1300
01:30:33,636 --> 01:30:35,054
Mommy, Mommy!

1301
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:43,688
Mommy--

1302
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:52,280
Hey, Carin.

1303
01:30:52,321 --> 01:30:53,448
Sorry.

1304
01:30:53,489 --> 01:30:54,407
It's okay.

1305
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:57,243
Uh, what's her name?

1306
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:58,953
This is Susie.

1307
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:01,038
Hey, Susie.

1308
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:03,875
Do you like dolls?

1309
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:05,877
Uh...

1310
01:31:07,211 --> 01:31:08,421
Not really.

1311
01:32:37,677 --> 01:32:38,427
Get away from her!

1312
01:32:38,469 --> 01:32:41,430
I know what you did.

1313
01:32:41,472 --> 01:32:43,057
You dirty girl!

1314
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:44,934
You filthy girl!

1315
01:32:47,478 --> 01:32:48,813
No!

1316
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,539
The spirits,
there are three of them.

1317
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:10,876
They never lived in this house,
but on this land.

1318
01:33:12,795 --> 01:33:14,380
This was farmland.

1319
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:19,135
Uh...

1320
01:33:21,137 --> 01:33:22,847
There was a woman.

1321
01:33:23,723 --> 01:33:25,975
She was wild. She...

1322
01:33:27,226 --> 01:33:28,978
Just so tormented.

1323
01:33:29,812 --> 01:33:32,356
She had an affair, and...

1324
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:36,152
...her husband went insane.

1325
01:33:37,486 --> 01:33:40,364
He took an axe,
and he went after her.

1326
01:33:40,406 --> 01:33:44,076
She hid in the basement,
but she wasn't alone.

1327
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:46,495
She went
with her elderly mother.

1328
01:33:48,998 --> 01:33:51,792
-And he killed them both.
-Look, we've seen

1329
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:54,045
violent manifestations
like that before.

1330
01:33:54,086 --> 01:33:55,755
So why is this different?

1331
01:33:55,796 --> 01:33:58,049
The three spirits are a façade.

1332
01:33:58,341 --> 01:34:00,885
Something else
is blocking my vision.

1333
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:03,304
Hiding behind them.

1334
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:05,348
Demonic?

1335
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:08,643
It's controlling the spirits.

1336
01:34:08,684 --> 01:34:10,728
It's using them
against the Smurls.

1337
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:11,771
But what's it want?

1338
01:34:12,521 --> 01:34:15,399
I mean, this has been going on
for months.

1339
01:34:15,775 --> 01:34:17,193
What's it waiting for?

1340
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:24,450
Judy!

1341
01:34:26,952 --> 01:34:28,412
Mom?

1342
01:34:28,954 --> 01:34:30,289
Can you come up here, please?

1343
01:34:52,728 --> 01:34:53,896
Mom?

1344
01:37:05,444 --> 01:37:06,529
Oh.

1345
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,176
Annabelle?

1346
01:37:55,828 --> 01:37:56,787
Judy?

1347
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:00,124
Are you there?

1348
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:02,167
Carin?

1349
01:39:14,615 --> 01:39:15,908
-Judy!
-Judy!

1350
01:39:18,285 --> 01:39:19,745
Your head!

1351
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:21,789
What happened?

1352
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:29,213
There's something in the attic.

1353
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:39,848
It can't be.

1354
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:44,895
It... found us.

1355
01:39:50,901 --> 01:39:52,152
Lorraine?

1356
01:39:57,950 --> 01:40:00,119
No, Lorraine. No, don't.

1357
01:40:14,216 --> 01:40:17,386
Ed, something's changed.

1358
01:40:20,014 --> 01:40:21,890
Something's different.

1359
01:40:29,314 --> 01:40:32,484
Then, after about a week,
Judy recovered.

1360
01:40:33,027 --> 01:40:35,154
The doctors said they'd never
seen anything like it.

1361
01:40:36,321 --> 01:40:38,032
She was a miracle.

1362
01:40:39,533 --> 01:40:42,786
But as for that mirror,
we never saw it again...

1363
01:40:44,788 --> 01:40:46,081
...until today.

1364
01:40:47,207 --> 01:40:48,625
But I don't understand.

1365
01:40:48,917 --> 01:40:50,711
Heather and I
threw that thing away.

1366
01:40:50,753 --> 01:40:53,756
With these things,
it's never that simple.

1367
01:40:55,132 --> 01:40:59,136
It wasn't done with you,
and it wasn't done with us.

1368
01:41:02,014 --> 01:41:03,766
Okay, so then what happened
to the woman

1369
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:06,685
from the antique store?

1370
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:11,231
We don't know.

1371
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:12,816
Uh...

1372
01:41:14,026 --> 01:41:15,235
We never went back.

1373
01:41:16,403 --> 01:41:19,406
That thing in your attic
is a demon.

1374
01:41:19,823 --> 01:41:21,867
It's the first one
that we ever encountered.

1375
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:25,788
We were young,
and we were scared,

1376
01:41:25,829 --> 01:41:27,623
and we almost lost our daughter.

1377
01:41:29,291 --> 01:41:32,044
So, we told ourselves that
the risk was just too great,

1378
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:34,171
so we couldn't chance
going back.

1379
01:41:35,589 --> 01:41:37,049
So, yes.

1380
01:41:39,009 --> 01:41:40,219
We ran away.

1381
01:41:43,847 --> 01:41:44,848
I'll...

1382
01:41:46,225 --> 01:41:48,602
...take it as a good sign
you're still here.

1383
01:41:48,644 --> 01:41:50,020
Mm.

1384
01:41:50,062 --> 01:41:51,271
We're not leaving you.

1385
01:42:00,072 --> 01:42:00,989
Some water?

1386
01:42:01,406 --> 01:42:02,574
Sorry.

1387
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:04,284
So, what now?

1388
01:42:05,661 --> 01:42:06,954
How do you get rid of it?

1389
01:42:08,705 --> 01:42:11,792
Ed! You're really
gonna take that thing home?

1390
01:42:11,834 --> 01:42:13,669
We can't leave it here.

1391
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:16,046
Artifact room is the only place
that can contain it.

1392
01:42:19,883 --> 01:42:23,929
All right, West Pittston,
back home to Monroe. Take 80.

1393
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:25,389
Lorraine and Judy
can stay behind.

1394
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:26,348
Wait, 84 is faster.

1395
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:28,809
Eighty is much quicker
this time of night.

1396
01:42:30,185 --> 01:42:32,229
Listen to me,
whatever happens tonight,

1397
01:42:32,271 --> 01:42:34,231
you have got to do
what I say, okay?

1398
01:42:35,190 --> 01:42:36,108
Got it.

1399
01:42:41,822 --> 01:42:43,073
What? What is it?

1400
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:48,245
It's nothin'.

1401
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:50,414
Everything okay?

1402
01:42:50,873 --> 01:42:52,749
I-It's just something
Lorraine said.

1403
01:42:54,501 --> 01:42:56,003
Something feels different.

1404
01:43:08,807 --> 01:43:11,185
Mom, I'm-- I'm sorry.

1405
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:13,228
No, I'm sorry.

1406
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:16,315
I should have never
let you stay.

1407
01:43:21,737 --> 01:43:24,239
Once we start,
there's no going back.

1408
01:43:25,574 --> 01:43:26,700
Don't look at it.

1409
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:30,704
And don't touch it directly.

1410
01:43:31,538 --> 01:43:32,873
Just keep your gloves on.

1411
01:43:33,665 --> 01:43:34,708
Anything can happen.

1412
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:38,086
And most likely, anything will.

1413
01:43:44,176 --> 01:43:45,677
"St. Michael the Archangel,

1414
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:48,305
defend us in the day of battle.

1415
01:43:49,681 --> 01:43:51,475
Be our safeguard
against the wickedness

1416
01:43:51,516 --> 01:43:52,434
and snares of the devil."

1417
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:56,021
"May God rebuke him.

1418
01:43:57,272 --> 01:44:00,400
And by the power of God,
cast into hell, Satan,

1419
01:44:00,442 --> 01:44:03,487
and all other evil spirits
who prowl through the world,

1420
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:05,697
seeking the ruin of souls."

1421
01:44:07,491 --> 01:44:08,659
"Amen."

1422
01:44:10,035 --> 01:44:11,411
-I'll get the car ready.
-Yeah.

1423
01:44:11,453 --> 01:44:12,663
-We'll be down in a second.
All right.

1424
01:44:15,749 --> 01:44:16,583
-You ready?
-Yeah.

1425
01:44:16,625 --> 01:44:18,293
Two, three... Yeah.

1426
01:44:20,379 --> 01:44:21,338
-Come on, Simon!
-Let's go, Simon!

1427
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:22,547
Come on, Simon!

1428

Girls, get him outta here.

We're trying!

1431
01:44:28,595 --> 01:44:30,973
So, is it just drywall
underneath the insulation?

1432
01:44:31,473 --> 01:44:32,182
Yeah.

1433
01:44:32,683 --> 01:44:34,309
So, if we step off these boards,

1434
01:44:34,351 --> 01:44:35,852
-we're going--
-Straight through the ceiling.

1435
01:44:36,186 --> 01:44:37,437
Don't wanna make it too easy.

1436
01:44:46,113 --> 01:44:47,281
Is it just me or...

1437
01:44:48,657 --> 01:44:50,284
or does it feel
like it's getting heavier?

1438
01:44:50,826 --> 01:44:52,577
It is.
Sometimes these things can be...

1439
01:44:53,662 --> 01:44:54,246
...stubborn.

1440
01:44:54,705 --> 01:44:55,539

-Yeah, I'm good.
-Okay.

1443
01:45:03,213 --> 01:45:04,256
Ed...

1444
01:45:05,590 --> 01:45:06,341
Look.

1445
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:11,555
Keep moving.

1446
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:19,438

1447
01:45:21,606 --> 01:45:24,526

1448
01:45:30,574 --> 01:45:31,408

1449
01:45:35,287 --> 01:45:36,830

-Good.

1624

All right.

Hey.

1626
02:02:49,653 --> 02:02:51,155
Welcome to the family.

Oh.

1641
02:05:13,422 --> 02:05:15,716
And that baby's
definitely gonna get spoiled.

1642
02:05:19,970 --> 02:05:22,181
We finally got
around to writing our book...

1643
02:05:23,265 --> 02:05:25,059
...and it was terrible.

1644
02:05:28,437 --> 02:05:30,356
But it shared
the story of our family...

1645
02:05:31,857 --> 02:05:33,609
and all those
that we met along the way.

1646
02:05:35,569 --> 02:05:37,029
And we still passed on

1647
02:05:37,071 --> 02:05:38,656
what we learned
to a new generation.

1648
02:05:45,621 --> 02:05:48,374
And we never stopped
having adventures.

1649
02:05:56,674 --> 02:05:59,134
And we never stopped
helping people...

1650
02:06:00,511 --> 02:06:02,179
...even when the only thing
we could do

1651
02:06:02,221 --> 02:06:03,597
was talk to them on the phone.

1652
02:06:09,228 --> 02:06:10,813
And then we were old.

1653
02:06:12,815 --> 02:06:16,610
And Judy and Tony were
visiting us with their kids.

1654
02:06:18,237 --> 02:06:19,989
And they brought their kids.

1655
02:06:21,699 --> 02:06:23,576
And I felt warmth...

1656
02:06:25,494 --> 02:06:26,787
and love...

1657
02:06:30,082 --> 02:06:33,043
...and comfort
for all of my days.

1658
02:06:38,007 --> 02:06:39,258

02:06:41,051 --> 02:06:42,303

1665
02:08:22,069 --> 02:08:25,072
We're in the home
of Janet and Jack Smurl.

1666
02:08:26,240 --> 02:08:28,534
...family
has experienced the rappings,

1667
02:08:29,076 --> 02:08:30,911
all the way down the hallway.

1668
02:08:33,205 --> 02:08:37,209
There are spirits that can do
great physical harm to people.

1669
02:08:37,251 --> 02:08:38,460
In the name
of Jesus Christ

1670
02:08:38,502 --> 02:08:39,461
and all that's holy,

1671
02:08:40,212 --> 02:08:41,964
we command you
to leave right now.

1672
02:08:42,005 --> 02:08:43,799
He felt like
he was being strangled.

1673
02:08:43,841 --> 02:08:45,134
You would see the child

1674
02:08:45,759 --> 02:08:48,762
pull invisible hands
away from his throat.

1675
02:08:50,347 --> 02:08:52,099
When a person
becomes frightened,

1676
02:08:52,141 --> 02:08:54,268
they throw off psychic energy
into the atmosphere,

1677
02:08:54,309 --> 02:08:57,062
which an evil spirit can use

1678
02:08:57,104 --> 02:08:59,106
as fuel to manifest
even more phenomena.

1679
02:09:03,402 --> 02:09:05,487
When you challenge the demonic,

1680
02:09:05,529 --> 02:09:08,699
it waits until you are
the most vulnerable,

1681
02:09:08,741 --> 02:09:10,367
then it strikes.

1682
02:09:14,037 --> 02:09:16,165
Diabolical spirit can appear

1683
02:09:16,206 --> 02:09:17,958
to anyone
in any guise it wishes.

1684
02:09:19,960 --> 02:09:21,420
...name of Jesus Christ,

1685
02:09:21,462 --> 02:09:24,089
I command you
to reveal your identity.

1686
02:09:25,132 --> 02:09:27,301
The front door would open,
slam,

1687
02:09:27,342 --> 02:09:29,928
and this voice
would say, "Janet?"

1688
02:09:31,138 --> 02:09:32,514
And, yeah,
this how they would swing,

1689
02:09:32,556 --> 02:09:33,932
back and forth,

1690
02:09:34,266 --> 02:09:36,268
when the infestation
was occurring.

1691
02:09:40,522 --> 02:09:41,398
I don't care
if you wanna call it

1692
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:43,525
a devil or a ghost or a demon,

1693
02:09:43,567 --> 02:09:46,820
something in this home
has the intelligence to inflict

1694
02:09:46,862 --> 02:09:49,740
physical and psychological harm
upon this family.
