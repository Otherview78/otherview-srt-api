Please! Please! Please!

Aziz, light!

Aziz, light.

8
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:35,050
Good.

00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:37,764
We start again.

See the snake, Billy?
The ultimate evil.

14
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:54,786
-Make sure you get the snake.
-Yes, I've got your snakes.

15
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:56,446
I got all the snakes.

16
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,865
So when is this snake
act supposed to occur?

17
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:02,457
Huh? Well, if
this is the five...

18

...and this is the one...

19
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,252
Every 5000 years.

20
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:15,219
So I've got some time, then.

21

Ah, you bring them water.

22
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:27,481
Good boy. I will
take it to them.

23

Go with God. Be safe from evil.

...gathering together the four elements
of life: water, fire, earth, air...

...around a fifth one.

Forgive me, lord.

-Yes, how are you today?
-Well, Billy. You have some glasses?

-Of course.
-Father, I'm so glad to see you.

34
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,482
It's the most
extraordinary thing.

35
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,019
I mean, look, it's the
greatest find in history.

36
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:11,358
Yes. You must be parched.

37
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,365
Oh, yes, yes. I'm sorry.

38
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,911
It's like a battle plan.

39

Here, the good. Here, the evil.

40
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:26,711
And here, a weapon against evil.

Let us toast to your fame.

Oh, yes. To fame.

You can't drink a toast with
water. Billy, in my sack, the grappa.

00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:46,856
Yes.

47
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,777
This I don't
understand. But this...

48
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:01,412
This could be something...

49
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,577
...prehistoric.

50
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,241
Maybe. I don't know.

51
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,244
But wait.

52
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:09,921
Here.

53
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,262
Look, look.

54
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,771
They're here.

55

This man...

56
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,577
...this perfect being.

57
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,117
I know this is
the key. I know it.

58
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:52,622
This divine light
they talk about.

59
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,790
What is divine light?

60
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,467
Aziz, light!

61
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:01,430
Much better. Thank you, Aziz.

62
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,607
My lord.

63
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:05,828
Father, this is the most
unbelievable thing I have ever seen.

64
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:07,204
Don't you think...?

65
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:11,792
Ah... Ah... Ah...

66
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:14,045
Are you German?

67
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:20,381
Lord, I know he was about
to discover everything.

68
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:23,592
But there is no worry.
I was there in time.

69
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:26,887
Priest, you and
those before you...

70
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,427
...have served us well.

71
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,436
But war is coming.

72

Stones not safe
on Earth anymore.

73
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:53,584
This...

74
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,582
...is really amazing.

75
00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:28,824
The fifth element.

76
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,789
Take the stones.

77
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,532
My lord...

78
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:18,498
...if you take the weapon, we will
be defenseless when evil returns.

79
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:23,212
In 300 years,
when evil returns...

80
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:25,342
...so shall we.

81
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,844
Oh, professor.

82
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,394
Professor.

83
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:44,357
Don't move!

00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,690
-I have a gun!
-Billy.

85
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:51,327
Please, understand.
They are our friends.

86
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:52,702
Friends?

87
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:56,287
Father, they've killed the
professor! They're monsters!

88
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:58,372
I'll explain everything. Billy.

89
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,666
-You're with them?
-Billy, look at me.

90
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:02,080
Look at me. I am your friend.

91
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:04,669
-No, Father.
-Billy, look at me!

92
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:08,928
Please, put the gun down.

93
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,554
No.

94
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:12,181
Billy, no!

95
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:21,102
Hurry! The wall is closing!

96
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:22,892
Here is your mission now:

97
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:27,108
Pass your knowledge to the next
priest as it was passed on to you.

98
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:30,901
I will do as you command, but
please, hurry, you still have time.

99
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,068
Time not important.

100
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:35,738
Only life important.

101
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:52,005
I will fulfill my mission!

102
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:53,764
You can count on me!

103
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:00,437
I will pass the knowledge
until your return.

104
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,593
-Anything yet?
-No, sir.

105
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,151
-Not even a temperature?
-The thermo-analyzers have jammed.

106
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:35,632
One of them shows a million
degrees, the others minus 5000.

107
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:37,929
Let's see it.

108
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,322
It's taking shape.

109
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:16,472
Send out a probe.

110
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:22,053
Ladies and gentlemen, the
president of the Federated Territories.

On air with General
Staedert in 30 seconds.

112
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:37,530
Oh, I saved this
seat for you, Father.

113
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,289
-President on the line, sir.
-We're in position, Mr. President.

114
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:45,543
I have to address the Supreme Council
in 10 minutes. Just the facts, general.

115
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:48,421
There are no results from the
chemical and molecular analysis as yet.

116
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:50,047
All the calibers are overshot.

117
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,048
<i>We're initiating a
thermonucleatic imaging.</i>

118
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,926
So, what you're saying is,
you don't know what this is.

119
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,429
Not yet, sir. All we know is,
it just keeps getting bigger.

120
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:58,680
Recommendation?

121
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,888
My philosophy, Mr. President, is
shoot first and ask questions later.

122
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:04,474
I don't like uninvited guests.

123
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:07,060
-All right, then, Staedert...
-Mr. President?

124
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,441
Yes?

<i>Priest Vito Cornelius,
expert of astrophenomenon.</i>

126
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:18,075
I have a different
theory to offer you, sir.

127
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:19,910
You have 20 seconds.

128
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,206
Imagine for a
moment that this...

129
00:14:28,369 --> 00:14:31,589
...thing is not anything
that can be identified...

130
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,920
...because it prefers not to be.

131
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:37,924
Wherever there is
life, it brings death...

132
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:42,767
-...because it is evil. Absolute evil.
-One more reason to shoot first.

133
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,599
Evil begets evil, Mr. President.

134
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,264
Shooting will only
make it stronger.

135
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,778
Probe will obtain its
objective in five seconds.

136
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,235
Growth rate is at 27 percent.

137
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:04,281
Your theory is interesting, but we
don't have time to go into that now.

138
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:07,950
Time is of no importance,
Mr. President. Only life is important.

139
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:10,586
You're right. That's exactly
what we're gonna do.

140
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,793
We're gonna protect the life of
some 200 billion of my fellow citizens.

141
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:15,503
General, you may
fire when ready.

solidified on the surface.

144
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:30,690
I think it's anticipating the attack.
Anticipation denotes intelligence.

145
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:34,898
The most terrible intelligence
imaginable, Mr. President.

146
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:40,111
120's loaded.

147
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:43,995
The ship is in combat formation.
Missiles are loaded, Mr. President.

00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:45,996
-Staedert.
<i>-Yes, sir.</i>

149
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:48,999
-I have a doubt.
-I don't, Mr. President.

150
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,836
Staedert?

151
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,013
What happened?
Staedert, can you hear me?

152
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:05,015
Staedert? What
happened, Staedert?

153
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:07,643
<i>-Did you destroy it?</i>
-I'm about to, sir.

154
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,268
The planet has increased
in diameter by 200 percent.

155
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:17,857
It's moving towards the ship.

156
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,535
What...? What do we
have that's bigger than 240?

157
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:27,037
Nothing, sir.

158
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:31,618
Staedert, do you hear
me? Get out of there.

159
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:35,038
I don't want an incident.
Do you hear me, Staedert?

160
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:38,378
<i>Get out of there. Can
you hear me, Staedert?</i>

161
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,508
<i>Do you understand? Listen.</i>

162
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,214
This is the president.
That's an order.

<i>-Oh, yeah, I forgot...</i>

178
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,799
<i>...you still prefer your
cat to the real thing.</i>

179
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,460
At least the cat comes back.

180
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:08,176
<i>You still pining for that two-timing
slut? There are a million women out there.</i>

181
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:12,138
I don't want a million
women. I just want one.

182
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,303
The perfect one.

183
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:18,975
<i>-It don't exist, major.</i>
-Yeah, I know. Ugh.

184
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,143
<i>-What?</i>
-I just found a picture of you.

185
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,778
<i>-Oh, how do I look?</i>
-Like shit.

186
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,438
<i>Must be an old picture.</i>

187
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:27,779
<i>Listen, you gotta bring me your
hack for a six-month overhaul.</i>

188
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,158
Negative.

189
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:30,986
I don't need one.

190
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:34,828
<i>Hey, you forgetting who sat next to you
for 1000 missions? I know how you drive.</i>

191
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,496
Finger, I drive a cab
now, not a space fighter.

192
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:43,336
<i>Okay, so tell me. How many
points you got left on your license?</i>

193
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,671
<i>Major, how many points?</i>

194
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,211
At least 50.

195
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,846
<i>Know what? You gotta
learn how to lie better.</i>

196
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,348
<i>See you tonight.</i>

197
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,556
<i>Welcome to paradise.</i>

198
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,349
<i>Welcome to Fhloston Paradise.</i>

199
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:03,439
<i>It's Ruby Rhod, your main
man, and I will tell you live at 5...</i>

200
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:06,902
<i>...the name of the winner of the
super-green Gemini Croquette Contest!</i>

201
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:10,284
<i>The winner will go with me for
two days to Fhloston Paradise.</i>

202
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,194
<i>So tune in to Radio Cosmos.</i>

203
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:15,365
Don't watch it all day,
sweetie. It'll rot your brain.

204
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,873
<i>For a perfect world.</i>

205
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,876
-Give me the cash.
-Been here long?

206
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,508
Yeah, long enough.
Come on, give me the cash.

207
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:29,841
Is that a Z-140?
Alleviated titanium.

208
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,722
-Neurocharged assault model.
-Yeah. Yeah.

209
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,342
Good thing for
me it's not loaded.

210
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,726
-What do you mean, it's not loaded?
-Well, you have to...

211
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:42,896
You have to push that
little yellow button to load it.

212
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:47,904
Take your time.

213
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,906
Oh, God.

214
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,484
You want me to...?

215
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,073
Okay.

216
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,247
There you go.

217
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:58,908
Give me the cash!

218
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,332
That's a very dangerous gun.

219
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:10,753
You know, maybe you better let
me hang on to this one for you, huh?

220
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:12,964
-You don't mind, do you?
-No.

221
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,805
-You sure?
-No. Take it. I don't need it.

222
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,766
That's a very nice hat.

223
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,275
You like it?

224
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,231
God!

225
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,031
<i>Please enter your license.</i>

226
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,287
Yes, yes, just a minute.

227
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,207
<i>Welcome on board, Mr. Dallas.</i>

228
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:44,252
Good morning. Sleep
well? Yeah, me too.

229
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:47,464
-I had a horrible nightmare.
<i>-Propulsion 2X4.</i>

230
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:54,471
<i>You have five points
left on your license.</i>

231
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,132
Yeah, thank you
for reminding me.

232
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,427
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

233
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:02,812
Why not?

234
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:12,610
You have 48 hours.

235
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:15,777
That's the length of time it needs
to adapt itself to our living conditions.

236
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,036
-And then?
-And then it will be too late.

237
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:21,620
The goal of this thing is not
to fight over money or power...

238
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:26,837
...but to exterminate
life. All forms of life.

239
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:29,965
So what you're telling me, Father,
there's nothing that can stop this.

240
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,463
There is only one thing.

241
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:40,972
<i>The Mondoshawan have
the only weapon to defeat evil.</i>

242
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,182
Four elements...

243
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,806
...gathered around a fifth...

244
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:50,732
...supreme being, the ultimate
warrior, created to protect life.

245
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:53,989
Together they produce what the
ancients called the Light of Creation.

246
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:57,742
Able to bring life to the
farthest reaches of the universe.

247
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:02,281
But if evil stands there...

248
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:05,082
Then what?

249
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:09,247
Then light turns to
dark. Life to death...

250
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:10,880
...forever.

251
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:15,385
Sir, there's a Mondoshawan
spaceship at the frontier...

252
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:17,888
...requesting permission
to enter our territory.

253
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:22,722
Give it permission to enter our
territory with our warmest regards.

254
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:23,931
Thank you.

255
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:26,100
<i>Permission to enter granted.</i>

256
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,406
Showtime.

257
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,491
We are lost.

258
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,581
Aknot, we are
connected to Earth.

259
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:36,841
Mr. Zorg's office.

260
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,297
<i>It's Aknot.</i>

261
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:41,927
I'm so glad to hear you, Aknot.

262
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:44,511
<i>The mission is accomplished.</i>

263
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:48,141
<i>You'll have what you
asked for in a few hours.</i>

264
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:51,974
Good. I'll meet
you at my factory.

265
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,526
The attack was launched
by two unregistered warships.

266
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:56,621
Close all borders and
declare a state of general alert.

267
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:57,646
Yes, sir.

268
00:23:57,812 --> 00:23:59,165
Try to make contact
with the Mondoshawans.

269
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,583
-We owe them an explanation.
-Sir.

270
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:04,157
Three hundred years
of waiting, for nothing.

271
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:06,746
Father, you should
go home now and rest.

272
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:08,248
No.

273
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:09,999
The Mondoshawan...

274
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:12,494
I am their contact on
Earth. They will come for me.

275
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:16,211
Father, this is government business
now. I will keep you informed.

276
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:21,670
The rescue team has reported
from the Mondoshawan crash site.

277
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,258
Any survivors?

278
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:24,718
Only one.

279
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:29,511
That what you call a survivor?

280
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:31,772
A few cells are still alive.
It's more than I need.

281
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,370
-Have you identified it?
-We tried...

282
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,115
...but the computer
went off the charts.

283
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:38,020
You see, normal human beings
have 40 DNA memo groups...

284
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:40,786
...which is more than enough for
any species to perpetuate itself.

285
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:43,943
This has 200,000 memo groups.

286
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:53,077
-Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
-Yeah, can't wait to meet him.

287
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:02,552
You okay, general? Over here.

288
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,884
Excuse me.

289
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:12,395
Okay, general, I want to
show you something here.

290
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:15,724
This is a normal human
DNA chain, okay?

291
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,063
You, me, anybody, right?

292
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:19,569
Watch this.

293
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:23,903
The compositional elements of
his DNA chain are the same as ours.

294
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:27,319
There's more of them, tightly
packed, with infinite genetic knowledge.

295
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:30,238
Almost like this
being was engineered.

296
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:35,726
-Is there any danger?
-No, no, no.

297
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,837
We put it through the
cellular hygiene detector.

298
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:40,090
The cell is, for lack
of a better word...

299
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,084
...perfect.

300
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,378
Okay, go ahead.

301
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:47,263
But Mr. Perfect
better be polite.

302
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:49,516
Otherwise, I turn
him into cat food.

303
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:51,305
Activate it.

304
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:24,168
Tissue processing.

305
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:40,976
Ten seconds to
ultraviolet protection.

306
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:48,574
This is the last phase.

307
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,613
The cells are bombarded
by greasy solar atoms...

308
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,908
...which forces the body
to react to protect itself.

309
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,539
That means growing skin.

310
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,074
Wonderful.

311
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,752
Reconstruction complete.

312
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:08,678
Remove the shield.

313
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:19,598
I told you. Perfect.

314
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:29,358
Thermal bandages.

315
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:38,116
I'd, um, like to take
a few pictures...

316
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:40,410
...for the archives.

317
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:42,556
-What's she saying?
-I don't know.

318
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,315
Activate the phonic detector.

319
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:59,164
Is, uh...? Is that thing solid?

320
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:00,790
-Unbreakable.
-Good.

321
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,461
If you want out...

322
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:16,515
...you're going to have to learn to
develop those communication skills.

323
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:35,867
General alert.

324
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:04,020
Perfect.

325
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,317
Ladder on 18.

326
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,705
Two men with me. The
rest in the main ventilation.

327
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:13,730
Okay, sir.

328
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,004
This way.

329
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,287
Okay, lady, stay calm.

330
00:31:11,454 --> 00:31:13,047
This is the police.

331
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,291
There's nowhere else to go.

332
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:19,429
So you're gonna slowly turn around
and put your hands on the floor.

333
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:21,214
Do you understand me?

334
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:25,935
She doesn't.

335
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:52,458
I think we need
a flying unit here.

336
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:58,419
<i>This is the police.
This is the police.</i>

337
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,552
We are processing
your identification.

338
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:03,215
<i>Please put your arms up
and follow our instructions.</i>

339
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:16,606
She has no file.

340
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:27,159
She dove off.

341
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:41,628
<i>You just had an accident.</i>

342
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:44,798
Yes, I know I just had an
accident, you daffy bastard!

343
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:48,652
-You have one point left on your license.
<i>-You have one point...</i>

344
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:50,223
Look out!

345
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:51,979
No, no! Left!

346
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:58,186
I can't believe it. Shit.

347
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:05,527
Any survivors?

348
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:13,034
Hi.

349
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:17,330

Excuse me, sir. The council is
worried about the economy heating up.

They wondered if it'd be
possible to fire 500,000.

Hundreds of people who will be
able to feed their children tonight...

strong and have children of their own...

1203
01:35:17,046 --> 01:35:19,265
<i>I don't know who they are,
but they're everywhere. Wait.</i>

1204
01:35:19,423 --> 01:35:21,596
<i>I see one of them. They're
warriors, and they're ugly.</i>

1205
01:35:21,759 --> 01:35:24,933
<i>They got big teeth and they got big
foreheads and big ears, and they stink.</i>

1206
01:35:25,095 --> 01:35:26,096
Mangalores.

1207
01:35:28,891 --> 01:35:31,360
The government sent me
to help you. Just stay calm.

1208
01:35:31,519 --> 01:35:35,649
If somebody hears this, come
and get me. I'm in the first row.

1209
01:35:37,691 --> 01:35:40,410
-You must give her the stones.
-Who?

1210
01:35:40,569 --> 01:35:42,287
The fifth element.

1211
01:35:42,446 --> 01:35:46,622
The supreme being sent to
Earth to save the universe.

1212
01:35:46,784 --> 01:35:49,503
-Leeloo?
-Yes.

1213
01:35:50,329 --> 01:35:53,708
But she's more
fragile than she seems.

1214
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:56,298
She needs your help...

1215
01:35:57,002 --> 01:35:58,970
...and your love...

1216
01:35:59,129 --> 01:36:02,724
...or she will die.

1217
01:36:06,762 --> 01:36:09,356
-No, no, no. Stay with me.
-Help!

1218
01:36:16,647 --> 01:36:20,823
If you want something
done, do it yourself.

1219
01:36:21,569 --> 01:36:24,994
Come on, honey. You can't die.
Come on. Listen to me. Wake up!

1220
01:36:25,155 --> 01:36:26,702
-Where are the stones?
-What?

1221
01:36:26,865 --> 01:36:29,334
The stones. Where
are the stones?

1222
01:36:29,493 --> 01:36:30,745
The stones.

1223
01:36:44,508 --> 01:36:46,351
They're not here.

1224
01:36:47,177 --> 01:36:49,350
The stones, where are they?

1225
01:36:50,889 --> 01:36:52,391
In me.

1226
01:36:52,808 --> 01:36:54,685
What? What?

1227
01:37:00,983 --> 01:37:03,202
Oh, my God, Korben.
Korben, another one coming.

1228
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,203
Korben. Korben, I
think we should go.

1229
01:37:05,362 --> 01:37:06,864
One minute. Just
give me a minute.

1230
01:37:07,031 --> 01:37:08,874
Hey, you!

1231
01:37:09,408 --> 01:37:11,126
I said, you.

1232
01:37:11,285 --> 01:37:13,003
-I'm not with him.
-Where's the other?

1233
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:18,383
I said, one minute.
Ruby, hold this gun.

1234
01:37:18,542 --> 01:37:20,920
-What? What do you want me to do?
-Hold this gun.

1235
01:37:21,086 --> 01:37:22,884
-Come on. Put your hand on it.
-Oh, my God.

1236
01:37:23,047 --> 01:37:24,845
-Got it? Hold it.
-What do I do?

1237
01:37:25,007 --> 01:37:26,884
If he moves,
squeeze the trigger.

1238
01:37:27,885 --> 01:37:29,728
I don't feel right. I
don't feel right, Korben.

1239
01:37:29,887 --> 01:37:32,231
The stones are "in me."

1240
01:37:41,899 --> 01:37:44,118
Korben, I got a
headache. This ain't me.

1241
01:37:58,916 --> 01:38:00,168
Ruby...

1242
01:38:02,628 --> 01:38:04,847
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1243
01:38:05,005 --> 01:38:06,257
Think he's gonna be okay?

1244
01:38:13,847 --> 01:38:16,270
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
Korben. Another one coming.

1245
01:38:18,811 --> 01:38:20,654
Aw, shit. Three
coming, Korben. Three.

1246
01:38:23,023 --> 01:38:25,321
Listen, you guard
this with your life...

1247
01:38:25,484 --> 01:38:27,844
...or you're gonna look like
this guy right here. You green?

1248
01:38:27,986 --> 01:38:29,829
-Green.
<i>-Super-green?</i>

1249
01:38:29,988 --> 01:38:31,456
<i>-Super-green.</i>
-Is that your idea...

1250
01:38:31,615 --> 01:38:33,037
...of a discreet operation?

1251
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:37,000
Don't worry, sir. I know my
man. He'll calm things down.

1252
01:38:49,466 --> 01:38:50,763
All right.

1253
01:39:04,273 --> 01:39:05,900
Move! Move!

1254
01:39:07,067 --> 01:39:09,035
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1255
01:39:09,194 --> 01:39:11,993
Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies
and gentlemen, this is amazing.

1256
01:39:14,032 --> 01:39:16,285
-Let me do it.
-Right.

1257
01:39:22,916 --> 01:39:26,170
Oh, my God. Korben Dallas, Korben,
my man. Korben Dallas is in trouble.

1258
01:39:29,173 --> 01:39:31,050
Hey. Ray!

1259
01:39:33,093 --> 01:39:34,094
The gun!

1260
01:39:35,971 --> 01:39:37,814
Give me the gun.
The gun. The gun!

1261
01:39:37,973 --> 01:39:43,571
I'm gonna go and try to see if I
can see something a little closer.

1262
01:40:00,162 --> 01:40:01,960
Yes, the gun. Yeah.

1263
01:40:11,173 --> 01:40:12,220
Thanks, Ray.

1264
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:16,804
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot! I'm not armed!

1265
01:40:16,970 --> 01:40:18,017
Get up!

1266
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:20,649
You've got the wrong
guy! Don't shoot!

1267
01:40:20,808 --> 01:40:22,105
I'm not armed! I'm not armed!

1268
01:40:25,729 --> 01:40:26,821
Oh, my God.

1269
01:40:26,980 --> 01:40:28,323
I'm on vacation.

1270
01:40:28,482 --> 01:40:32,612
It's... Don't shoot me, please.
I'm on a vacation. I won a...

1271
01:40:33,987 --> 01:40:35,113
...contest.

1272
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:38,910
Gemini Croquette's
to Fhloston Paradise.

1273
01:40:41,495 --> 01:40:43,122
Down.

1274
01:40:44,581 --> 01:40:46,675
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
-Get down!

1275
01:40:48,752 --> 01:40:50,470
I think he's trying to
say something to me.

1276
01:40:50,629 --> 01:40:52,256
Get down!

1277
01:41:06,019 --> 01:41:07,145
Sorry. Sorry, my man.

1278
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:17,824
Korben. Korben?
Where are you, man?

1279
01:41:19,157 --> 01:41:21,785
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Korben.

1280
01:41:21,952 --> 01:41:24,205
They're coming.
Korben, they're coming.

1281
01:41:26,039 --> 01:41:27,541
Korben!

1282
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:30,127
-Don't move.
-What?

1283
01:41:40,512 --> 01:41:43,391
-What you doing?
-Count to 10.

1284
01:41:51,481 --> 01:41:53,521
-Korben? Was that a bomb?
-Just shut up and count!

1285
01:41:53,609 --> 01:41:56,658
One, two, three, four, five...

1286
01:41:56,820 --> 01:41:59,073
...six, seven, eight...

1287
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:02,163
...nine...

1288
01:42:25,724 --> 01:42:27,021
Ten.

1289
01:42:32,981 --> 01:42:36,906
I am very disappointed!

1290
01:42:37,527 --> 01:42:39,700
Korben, my man. Korben,
what are you looking for?

1291
01:42:39,863 --> 01:42:41,115
Control room.

1292
01:42:42,908 --> 01:42:44,668
-This is it.
-I'll be over here, all right?

1293
01:42:44,743 --> 01:42:46,245
Let's go! Let's go!

1294
01:42:49,539 --> 01:42:51,132
Quiet! Quiet!

1295
01:42:52,626 --> 01:42:54,970
-You in charge?
-Yeah.

1296
01:42:55,128 --> 01:42:56,630
How many of them are out there?

1297
01:42:57,714 --> 01:42:59,387
-I don't know.
-Let's count.

1298
01:43:02,886 --> 01:43:04,934
Seven on the left.
Five on the right.

1299
01:43:11,395 --> 01:43:13,397
Four on the right.
Two on the left.

1300
01:43:14,773 --> 01:43:17,533
We need to find the leader.
Mangalores won't fight without the leader.

1301
01:43:17,943 --> 01:43:20,366
One more shot and
we start killing hostages.

1302
01:43:21,446 --> 01:43:24,666
-That's the leader.
-Send someone to negotiate.

1303
01:43:26,827 --> 01:43:29,171
I've never negotiated.

1304
01:43:29,329 --> 01:43:31,331
You mind if I try?

1305
01:43:31,498 --> 01:43:33,250
No, no. Sure, sure. Sure.

1306
01:43:33,417 --> 01:43:35,920
We're sending
somebody in to negotiate!

1307
01:43:44,803 --> 01:43:46,897
Anybody else wanna negotiate?

1308
01:43:47,055 --> 01:43:49,774
Where did he learn
to negotiate like that?

1309
01:43:50,267 --> 01:43:51,610
I wonder.

1310
01:43:56,106 --> 01:43:57,449
Where's Ruby?

1311
01:43:58,442 --> 01:43:59,910
I thought he was dead.

1312
01:44:00,068 --> 01:44:01,115
Master!

1313
01:44:01,778 --> 01:44:04,497
It was nothing, really. It
was just a helping hand.

1314
01:44:04,948 --> 01:44:07,326
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Ruby Rhod...

1315
01:44:07,492 --> 01:44:09,586
...still alive. Aah!

1316
01:44:09,745 --> 01:44:12,339
What's wrong with you? It hurt!

1317
01:44:14,499 --> 01:44:16,501
Wow. Zoom.

1318
01:44:18,336 --> 01:44:22,136
Korben, I realize that you
must be pretty mad at me...

1319
01:44:22,299 --> 01:44:24,779
...but I want you to know that I
am fighting for a noble cause.

1320
01:44:24,926 --> 01:44:27,725
Yes, you're trying to save
the world. I remember.

1321
01:44:28,221 --> 01:44:30,189
Right now, I'm trying
to save Leeloo, Father.

1322
01:44:30,348 --> 01:44:33,147
-Leeloo's in trouble?
-When is Leeloo not in trouble?

1323
01:44:33,310 --> 01:44:35,733
-There. Where is that?
-That's the diva's suite.

1324
01:44:36,521 --> 01:44:38,273
Leeloo.

1325
01:44:39,983 --> 01:44:42,236
Leeloo. Hang on.

1326
01:44:45,614 --> 01:44:48,914
Here, come on. How the hell do
you get yourself into these positions?

1327
01:44:50,035 --> 01:44:51,332
Come on.

1328
01:44:54,539 --> 01:44:57,543
Yeah, I'm here. It's all right. It's
all right. Everything's okay now.

1329
01:44:58,001 --> 01:44:59,048
Listen.

1330
01:45:01,755 --> 01:45:04,679
I got the stones. All right,
just take it easy, all right?

1331
01:45:07,344 --> 01:45:11,315
My man, my man, my man. What's
this thing with all these numbers?

1332
01:45:17,020 --> 01:45:19,022
It's... It's...

1333
01:45:19,189 --> 01:45:21,112
No, no, no.

1334
01:45:21,274 --> 01:45:22,901
Because if it was a bomb...

1335
01:45:23,068 --> 01:45:26,663
...the alarms would go off because all
these hotels have bomb detectors. Right?

1336
01:45:29,324 --> 01:45:31,326
<i>This is a Type A alert.</i>

1337
01:45:31,493 --> 01:45:35,214
<i>For security reasons, the
hotel must be evacuated.</i>

1338
01:45:36,414 --> 01:45:38,087
<i>Please proceed
calmly to the lifeboats...</i>

1339
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:39,752
Stay calm!

1340
01:45:39,918 --> 01:45:41,420
<i>...located in the main hallways.</i>

1341
01:45:41,586 --> 01:45:42,803
Please, stay calm!

1342
01:45:48,426 --> 01:45:51,100
Korben. Korben, my man,
you know how to stop this, right?

1343
01:45:53,223 --> 01:45:54,850
Korben?

1344
01:45:56,810 --> 01:46:00,110
<i>Two minutes to
complete evacuation.</i>

1345
01:46:02,107 --> 01:46:04,951
-Get back!
-Evacuation! Evacuation!

1346
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:08,455
Sorry, sir, you can't stay here.
There's a bomb in the hotel.

1347
01:46:13,410 --> 01:46:14,582
I know.

1348
01:46:29,551 --> 01:46:32,350
-I don't want to die.
-Please, my son.

1349
01:46:32,929 --> 01:46:34,272
Get in. Get in.

1350
01:46:39,102 --> 01:46:41,901
<i>One minute to total evacuation.</i>

1351
01:46:46,359 --> 01:46:47,611
This one.

1352
01:46:51,114 --> 01:46:52,912
<i>Forty-five seconds.</i>

1353
01:46:56,119 --> 01:46:57,746
Get her strapped in.

1354
01:47:02,626 --> 01:47:05,505
Korben, Korben. Korben, my
man, you know how to fly this thing?

1355
01:47:05,670 --> 01:47:06,922
Just like driving a cab.

1356
01:47:11,676 --> 01:47:13,474
But the door? How we
gonna get out the door?

1357
01:47:26,983 --> 01:47:28,826
<i>Fifteen seconds.</i>

1358
01:47:33,615 --> 01:47:37,165
<i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>

1359
01:47:37,327 --> 01:47:41,798
<i>...seven, six, five...</i>

1360
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:00,483
For the honor.

1361
01:48:04,479 --> 01:48:05,605
Oh, no.

1362
01:48:06,231 --> 01:48:07,483
You should hold on.

1363
01:48:20,495 --> 01:48:21,667
Come on.

1364
01:48:29,838 --> 01:48:31,055
Like driving a cab.

1365
01:48:33,049 --> 01:48:35,723
Ladies and gentlemen, it is
now 7 p.m. Time for the news.

1366
01:48:35,885 --> 01:48:37,853
See you tomorrow
for a new adventure.

1367
01:48:38,221 --> 01:48:39,894
<i>End of transmission.</i>

1368
01:48:40,849 --> 01:48:42,851
That's the best show I ever did.

1369
01:48:45,645 --> 01:48:48,489
Mr. President, Major Dallas
has the five elements on board...

1370
01:48:48,648 --> 01:48:51,401
...and the priest is guiding
them directly to the temple.

1371
01:48:56,031 --> 01:48:57,374
We're saved.

1372
01:49:13,548 --> 01:49:16,222
The diva said that I
should take care of you.

1373
01:49:17,218 --> 01:49:19,846
Humans act so strange.

1374
01:49:20,013 --> 01:49:21,230
What do you mean?

1375
01:49:22,932 --> 01:49:24,934
Everything you created...

1376
01:49:25,101 --> 01:49:26,728
...is used to destroy.

1377
01:49:27,103 --> 01:49:28,776
Yeah.

1378
01:49:28,938 --> 01:49:32,613
We call it human nature. You
learn about that on your screen?

1379
01:49:32,776 --> 01:49:35,620
I'm not finished
yet. I'm up to V.

1380
01:49:36,446 --> 01:49:37,789
V is good.

1381
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:40,116
Some very good words in V.

1382
01:49:40,283 --> 01:49:41,580
Like what?

1383
01:49:43,912 --> 01:49:45,255
Valiant.

1384
01:49:45,830 --> 01:49:47,332
Vulnerable.

1385
01:49:49,459 --> 01:49:51,132
Very beautiful.

1386
01:50:02,931 --> 01:50:05,434
Oh, of course, Munro!

1387
01:50:06,768 --> 01:50:09,271
-Mr. President?
-Yes, now what?

1388
01:50:12,607 --> 01:50:13,984
We have a problem.

1389
01:50:19,489 --> 01:50:20,832
What do you mean,
it's advancing?

1390
01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:24,711
It's moving at incredible speed.
We're having trouble following it.

1391
01:50:29,124 --> 01:50:32,469
And do you have any
idea where it's heading?

1392
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:42,179
Korben, there's a
general on the phone.

1393
01:50:43,012 --> 01:50:45,185
I'll give you to the president.

1394
01:50:45,849 --> 01:50:48,819
Major Dallas, I first would
like to salute a warrior.

1395
01:50:48,977 --> 01:50:50,777
<i>You're a shining example
of this army's might.</i>

1396
01:50:50,854 --> 01:50:52,665
-Mr. President.
<i>-In the name of the Federation...</i>

1397
01:50:52,689 --> 01:50:54,333
<i>-...and its territories...</i>
-Any idea when you're gonna be...

1398
01:50:54,357 --> 01:50:55,483
...getting to the point?

1399
01:50:57,861 --> 01:51:02,662
Okay. There's a ball of fire 1200 miles
in diameter heading straight for Earth...

1400
01:51:02,824 --> 01:51:06,169
<i>...and we have no idea how
to stop it. That's the problem.</i>

1401
01:51:09,497 --> 01:51:10,999
How much time do we have?

1402
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,504
If its speed remains constant,
in an hour and 57 minutes.

1403
01:51:16,546 --> 01:51:18,548
I'll call you back in two hours.

1404
01:51:18,715 --> 01:51:21,719
Hello? Hello? Hello?

1405
01:52:31,621 --> 01:52:33,589
They just landed in the desert.

1406
01:52:35,959 --> 01:52:37,506
Good job, David.

1407
01:52:39,212 --> 01:52:41,465
-Put her in the center.
-Where? Here?

1408
01:52:49,222 --> 01:52:50,974
You got it figured out, Father?

1409
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:53,689
This one should be fire.

1410
01:52:53,851 --> 01:52:55,891
-You know how all this works?
-Theoretically, yes.

1411
01:52:55,979 --> 01:52:59,449
-Theoretically?
-The four stones should go around.

1412
01:52:59,607 --> 01:53:01,655
The fifth element
should be in the middle...

1413
01:53:01,818 --> 01:53:04,947
...and then the weapon
against evil should work.

1414
01:53:05,113 --> 01:53:06,873
You've never seen this
work before, have you?

1415
01:53:07,031 --> 01:53:08,658
No.

1416
01:53:08,825 --> 01:53:12,250
Every weapon has a manual.
I'm sure this has one too.

1417
01:53:20,545 --> 01:53:23,344
That's it. That's it. Match
up the symbols. Go! Go!

1418
01:53:25,008 --> 01:53:26,055
Wind.

1419
01:53:27,927 --> 01:53:29,975
My man, what you doing?

1420
01:53:30,138 --> 01:53:32,061
-What?
-What you doing?

1421
01:53:33,266 --> 01:53:35,064
Trying to keep you
in the DJ business.

1422
01:53:38,771 --> 01:53:39,863
Fire.

1423
01:53:41,316 --> 01:53:42,408
Done.

1424
01:53:42,567 --> 01:53:46,413
-So, what happens now?
-So now, we have to open them.

1425
01:53:47,530 --> 01:53:50,909
-And you know how to do that, right?
-Theoretically...

1426
01:53:52,660 --> 01:53:53,752
-...no.
-No.

1427
01:53:58,583 --> 01:54:01,336
Leeloo, wake up, honey,
wake up. You have to help us.

1428
01:54:01,502 --> 01:54:04,381
Leeloo. How do you
open these stones?

1429
01:54:05,590 --> 01:54:07,558
Wind blows.

1430
01:54:09,052 --> 01:54:10,599
Fire burns.

1431
01:54:10,762 --> 01:54:14,107
Yes, I know all that. But how
do you open these stones?

1432
01:54:14,432 --> 01:54:15,729
Rain...

1433
01:54:19,103 --> 01:54:20,571
...falls.

1434
01:54:24,067 --> 01:54:25,740
Leeloo. Leeloo.

1435
01:54:27,070 --> 01:54:28,413
What does it mean?

1436
01:54:30,239 --> 01:54:31,536
I think that...

1437
01:54:31,699 --> 01:54:33,076
-Maybe it's a charade.
-What?

1438
01:54:33,242 --> 01:54:34,585
A game or something.

1439
01:54:34,744 --> 01:54:37,497
If we don't get these stones
open in five minutes, we're all dead.

1440
01:54:37,664 --> 01:54:39,211
-Dead?
-Yes, dead.

1441
01:54:51,844 --> 01:54:53,141
Too late.

1442
01:54:54,931 --> 01:54:58,105
-We've lost contact with them.
-Three minutes.

1443
01:54:59,602 --> 01:55:02,606
I think mine is broken. Why
I gotta get the broke one?

1444
01:55:11,114 --> 01:55:12,787
We're never gonna make it.

1445
01:55:17,745 --> 01:55:20,294
Korben. Korben, it moved!

1446
01:55:21,749 --> 01:55:23,149
What'd you do?
Show me what you did.

1447
01:55:23,292 --> 01:55:25,636
-Nothing.
-Shut up, shut up!

1448
01:55:25,795 --> 01:55:28,765
Calm down. Show me what you
did. Take me through it, step by step.

1449
01:55:28,923 --> 01:55:31,142
-I was just standing here like this.
-Quickly.

1450
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:35,646
Okay, and I put my hands
on the top like this, and I said:

1451
01:55:36,514 --> 01:55:38,482
"We're not gonna make it."

1452
01:55:40,143 --> 01:55:41,395
That's it?

1453
01:55:50,153 --> 01:55:51,496
Korben, my man.

1454
01:55:52,155 --> 01:55:53,623
Wind.

1455
01:55:54,031 --> 01:55:56,329
She said, "Wind... Wind blows."

1456
01:56:04,208 --> 01:56:05,710
Everyone take a stone.

1457
01:56:06,043 --> 01:56:09,013
Water for water. Fire for
fire. Earth for earth. Go, now!

1458
01:56:11,424 --> 01:56:12,641
Earth.

1459
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:14,347
-Open the other one.
-Okay.

1460
01:56:27,565 --> 01:56:29,738
K... Korben.

1461
01:56:30,193 --> 01:56:32,571
Korben, my man, I have no fire.

1462
01:56:32,737 --> 01:56:34,956
I have no matches. Do
you have any matches?

1463
01:56:35,114 --> 01:56:37,492
I stopped smoking. If I knew...
I mean... Father, you smoke?

1464
01:56:37,658 --> 01:56:40,377
Got some matches?
Matches? We need some fire.

1465
01:56:41,662 --> 01:56:43,380
We all gonna die.

1466
01:56:50,588 --> 01:56:52,056
Don't breathe.

1467
01:57:11,275 --> 01:57:12,401
Fire.

1468
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:14,236
One minute.

1469
01:57:14,403 --> 01:57:15,905
Let's go. Let's go. Leeloo.

1470
01:57:16,072 --> 01:57:19,121
Wake up. Wake up. It's
time for you to work now.

1471
01:57:19,826 --> 01:57:21,419
Protect life...

1472
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:23,872
...until death.

1473
01:57:24,038 --> 01:57:26,917
No, no, Leeloo! Listen to
me! Listen to me. Listen.

1474
01:57:27,083 --> 01:57:29,757
Listen, I know you're very
tired. I know you're very tired.

1475
01:57:29,919 --> 01:57:33,719
I'll take you on a vacation when
we're done. I swear, just you and me.

1476
01:57:33,881 --> 01:57:37,260
But if you don't do something right
now, we're all gonna die. You understand?

1477
01:57:37,426 --> 01:57:41,351
What's the use of saving life
when you see what you do with it?

1478
01:57:41,514 --> 01:57:44,108
It'll be entering the
atmosphere in 40 seconds.

1479
01:57:45,518 --> 01:57:47,111
<i>Leeloo, you're right.</i>

1480
01:57:47,270 --> 01:57:49,113
But there are some things...

1481
01:57:49,272 --> 01:57:51,946
...very nice things worth
saving, some beautiful things.

1482
01:57:52,441 --> 01:57:54,318
Beautiful things.

1483
01:57:55,278 --> 01:57:56,746
Like love?

1484
01:57:56,904 --> 01:57:58,906
Yes, love. That's
good. That's good.

1485
01:57:59,073 --> 01:58:01,872
That's a good example. Like
love. Love is worth saving.

1486
01:58:02,451 --> 01:58:04,294
I don't know love.

1487
01:58:06,163 --> 01:58:07,540
I don't know love.

1488
01:58:07,707 --> 01:58:10,005
I was built to
protect, not to love.

1489
01:58:10,167 --> 01:58:13,011
So there's no use
for me other than this.

1490
01:58:13,170 --> 01:58:15,593
No, no, no, you're wrong.
You're wrong. You're wrong.

1491
01:58:16,299 --> 01:58:19,303
I need you. I need
you, very much.

1492
01:58:21,053 --> 01:58:22,270
Why?

1493
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:27,235
Because...

1494
01:58:28,144 --> 01:58:30,647
Tell her, Korben.

1495
01:58:31,981 --> 01:58:34,700
Tell me. Please.

1496
01:58:34,859 --> 01:58:36,702
Why do you need me?

1497
01:58:37,445 --> 01:58:40,324
-Because...
-Tell me.

1498
01:58:42,491 --> 01:58:43,993
-Tell me.
-Because I...

1499
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:45,662
Because I love you.

1500
01:58:46,871 --> 01:58:48,214
I love you.

1501
01:58:52,251 --> 01:58:56,381
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

1502
01:58:56,923 --> 01:59:00,348
...six, five, four, three...

1503
01:59:00,718 --> 01:59:03,141
...two, one.

1504
01:59:41,133 --> 01:59:45,263
<i>Scanner imaging has
confirmed the dark planet: dead.</i>

1505
01:59:45,930 --> 01:59:48,809
The planet seems to have
stopped at 62 miles from impact.

1506
02:00:00,361 --> 02:00:01,704
Yes!

1507
02:00:01,862 --> 02:00:03,990
What's wrong with you?
What you screaming for?

1508
02:00:04,156 --> 02:00:06,500
Every five minutes, it's
something. A bomb or something.

1509
02:00:06,659 --> 02:00:09,082
I'm leaving. Bzz!

1510
02:00:22,675 --> 02:00:23,892
Mr. President.

1511
02:00:24,051 --> 02:00:26,804
Let me introduce you to Professor
Mactilburgh who runs the center.

1512
02:00:26,971 --> 02:00:28,769
It's an honor to receive
you, Mr. President.

1513
02:00:28,931 --> 02:00:30,558
Yes, well... Where
are my two heroes?

1514
02:00:30,725 --> 02:00:34,525
Oh, they were so tired from their ordeal,
we put them in the reactor this morning.

1515
02:00:34,687 --> 02:00:36,610
I have 19 more
meetings after this one.

1516
02:00:36,772 --> 02:00:39,195
Yeah. I'm sorry. Let
me see if they're revived.

1517
02:00:39,358 --> 02:00:40,484
Thank you.

1518
02:00:40,651 --> 02:00:42,211
We go live in one
minute, Mr. President.

1519
02:00:42,361 --> 02:00:43,783
Mm-hm.

1520
02:00:49,577 --> 02:00:50,954
Ah...

1521
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:52,622
They're...

1522
02:00:53,831 --> 02:00:55,754
...not ready.

1523
02:00:55,916 --> 02:00:57,168
They need...

1524
02:00:57,334 --> 02:01:00,133
-...five more minutes.
-You have 20 seconds.

1525
02:01:00,296 --> 02:01:02,469
No, ma'am. No, no,
I tried. No, ma'am.

1526
02:01:02,631 --> 02:01:03,757
Who's that?

1527
02:01:03,924 --> 02:01:05,524
Some woman. Claims
to be Korben's mother.

1528
02:01:05,676 --> 02:01:07,428
Well, give it here.

1529
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:12,646
Mrs. Dallas, this is the president.
On behalf of the Federation...

<i>Please, that doesn't
even sound like him.</i>

1531
02:01:14,977 --> 02:01:17,177
<i>The president's an idiot.
You don't sound like an idiot.</i>

1532
02:01:17,313 --> 02:01:20,066
<i>If you don't want to talk to your
mother, just avoid me like usual.</i>

1533

just Saran Wrap myself to the bed...</i>
