1
00:00:32,196 --> 00:00:35,632
<i>There's a moment of orderly
silence before a football play begins.</i>

2
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:40,333
<i>Players are in position, linemen
are frozen, and anything is possible.</i>

3
00:00:40,504 --> 00:00:43,564
<i>Almost Indian-summer
weather here in mid-November.</i>

4
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:50,112
<i>Then, like a traffic accident,
stuff begins to randomly collide.</i>

5
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:53,045
<i>From the snap of the ball
to the snap of the first bone...</i>

6
00:00:53,217 --> 00:00:55,947
<i>...is closer to four seconds than five.</i>

7
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,021
<i>First and 10.
Riggins, flea flicker back to Theismann.</i>

8
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,090
<i>Theismann's in a lot of trouble.</i>

9
00:01:04,128 --> 00:01:07,393
<i>One Mississippi.
Joe Theismann, the Redskins' quarterback...</i>

10
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:10,033
<i>...takes the snap and hands off
to his running back.</i>

11
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:11,532
<i>First and 10. Riggins-</i>

12
00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:13,294
<i>Two Mississippi.</i>

13
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:15,632
<i>It's a trick play, a flea flicker...</i>

14
00:01:15,806 --> 00:01:18,741
<i>...and the running back tosses the ball
back to the quarterback.</i>

15
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:21,241
<i>Flea flicker back to Theismann.</i>

16
00:01:21,712 --> 00:01:22,838
<i>Three Mississippi.</i>

17
00:01:23,014 --> 00:01:27,041
<i>Up to now, the play's been defined
by what the quarterback sees.</i>

18
00:01:27,218 --> 00:01:30,619
<i>It’s about to be defined
by what he doesn't.</i>

19
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:32,720
<i>Four Mississippi.</i>

20
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,519
<i>Lawrence Taylor is the best
defensive player in the NFL...</i>

21
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:40,061
<i>...and has been from the time he
stepped onto the field as a rookie.</i>

22
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:42,028
<i>Theismann's in a lot of trouble.</i>

23
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:43,723
<i>And it was Lawrence Taylor...</i>

24
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:48,099
<i>...who slammed Theismann to the ground
at the 42-yard line. The blitz was on...</i>

25
00:01:48,272 --> 00:01:51,571
<i>He will also change
the game of football as we know it.</i>

26
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:54,267
<i>We'll look at it with
the reverse angle one more time.</i>

27
00:01:54,445 --> 00:01:57,312
<i>And I suggest if your stomach is weak,
you just don't watch.</i>

28
00:01:57,481 --> 00:01:59,540
<i>Legendary quarterback Joe Theismann...</i>

29
00:01:59,717 --> 00:02:02,185
<i>...never played another down of football.</i>

30
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:06,687
<i>Now, y'all would guess that,
more often than not...</i>

31
00:02:06,857 --> 00:02:10,156
<i>...the highest paid player
on an NFL team is a quarterback...</i>

32
00:02:10,328 --> 00:02:11,818
<i>...and you'd be right.</i>

33
00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:14,726
<i>But what you probably don't know
is, more often than not...</i>

34
00:02:14,899 --> 00:02:19,598
<i>...the second highest paid player is,
thanks to Lawrence Taylor, a left tackle.</i>

35
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,706
<i>Because as every housewife knows, the
first check you write is for the mortgage...</i>

36
00:02:23,874 --> 00:02:26,365
<i>...but the second is for the insurance.</i>

37
00:02:26,544 --> 00:02:31,106
<i>And the left tackle's job is to protect the
quarterback from what he can't see coming.</i>

38
00:02:31,282 --> 00:02:33,045
<i>To protect his blind side.</i>

39
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:37,050
<i>The ideal left tackle is big,
but a lot of people are big.</i>

40
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:40,190
<i>He's wide in the butt
and massive in the thighs.</i>

41
00:02:40,358 --> 00:02:44,454
<i>He has long arms, giant hands
and feet as quick as a hiccup.</i>

42
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,155
<i>This is a rare and expensive
combination...</i>

43
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:54,066
<i>...the need for which can be traced to that
Monday night game and Lawrence Taylor.</i>

44
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:58,868
<i>For on that day, he not only
altered Joe Theismann's life...</i>

45
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:00,442
<i>...but mine as well.</i>

46
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:08,816
Mr. Oher.

47
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:10,920
Mr. Oher.

48
00:03:11,122 --> 00:03:13,955
Do you understand?
Do you know why I'm here?

49
00:03:15,092 --> 00:03:16,855
To investigate?

50
00:03:17,027 --> 00:03:18,654
Yes. To investigate.

51
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:24,433
I'm here to investigate
your odd... predicament.

52
00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:28,061
Do you find it odd, your predicament?

53
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:31,469
Michael?

54
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:34,009
I don't know.

55
00:03:35,045 --> 00:03:38,481
- Can I-? Can I leave now?
- No, you can’t.

56
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,728
Where's Coach Cotton's office?

57
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:38,130
Thanks, man.

58
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:49,878
They said you were the coach.

59
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:51,911
Bert Cotton.

60
00:05:52,783 --> 00:05:56,241
Tony Hamilton, but everybody
just calls me Big Tony.

61
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:03,116
Hey, Big Mike, check it out.

62
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:07,222
Not even locked.

63
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:10,632
White people are crazy.

64
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:16,838
<i>I promised my ma, Boo,
on her deathbed...</i>

65
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:20,670
...that I'd get my son, Steven, out of
public school and into a church school.

66
00:06:20,844 --> 00:06:25,247
I appreciate that, Tony,
but I'm not involved with admissions.

67
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,907
I just figured maybe
I can come talk to you...

68
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:30,553
...seeing as though
you might need some players.

69
00:06:31,322 --> 00:06:35,918
- What kind of sport does he play?
- Anything with a ball. The boy's good too.

70
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:38,926
Classes start in a week.
It'd have to be for next semester.

71
00:06:40,331 --> 00:06:41,958
I know what you're thinking, coach.

72
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:45,267
But look here, I got money, all right?

73
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:48,530
See, I'm a mechanic at Wilson’s Auto,
the other side of town.

74
00:06:48,872 --> 00:06:53,605
Well, look, what if somebody drops out
or moves? Could they get in then?

75
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:56,811
"They"? You only mentioned one son.

76
00:06:56,981 --> 00:07:00,109
That’s right, Steven.
But there's another boy.

77
00:07:00,451 --> 00:07:03,784
- Heh. Another boy?
- Yeah.

78
00:07:06,824 --> 00:07:10,282
Big Mike. Sleeps on my couch
from time to time.

79
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:13,021
It's a bad deal. You know,
his mom's on that crack pipe.

80
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:16,655
He ain't got nobody else. He just
wanted to come along for the ride.

81
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:18,695
- They're here?
- Yeah.

82
00:07:19,737 --> 00:07:23,173
Now, the little one, that’s Steven...

83
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,932
...and the big one...

84
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:26,201
Big Mike.

85
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:36,844
Swish!

86
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:41,381
Big Mike! Ha-ha.

87
00:07:43,193 --> 00:07:44,626
Come on.

88
00:07:51,502 --> 00:07:53,094
Mother of God.

89
00:07:54,571 --> 00:07:57,540
<i>Steven Hamilton's paperwork
looks acceptable to me...</i>

90
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:00,939
...and I believe he'll do fine.
But this other kid...

91
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:03,170
- Big Mike.
- Michael Oher...

92
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:05,781
...gives us no reason to believe that...

93
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:09,316
...based on his records,
that he would be successful here.

94
00:08:09,486 --> 00:08:10,680
Well, how bad could it be?

95
00:08:10,854 --> 00:08:14,381
We're not exactly sure how old he is,
due to his lack of records.

96
00:08:14,558 --> 00:08:17,550
He has a measured IQ of 80,
which is sixth percentile.

97
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:22,394
His grade-point average
begins with zero, 0.6.

98
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:24,500
Everyone passed him along.

99
00:08:24,668 --> 00:08:28,104
They gave him D's so they could
hand their problem off to the next school.

100
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:31,405
He's a brave kid.

101
00:08:34,178 --> 00:08:38,706
For wanting to come here,
for wanting a quality education.

102
00:08:38,882 --> 00:08:43,376
An education denied him by
the poor quality of schools he's attended.

103
00:08:43,554 --> 00:08:47,354
Most kids with his background wouldn’t
come within 200 miles of this place.

104
00:08:47,524 --> 00:08:52,484
Coach Cotton, we understand your interest
in this young man’s athletic abilities.

105
00:08:52,663 --> 00:08:55,632
He wouldn’t be able to play sports
until he got his grades up.

106
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,892
Forget sports.

107
00:08:58,102 --> 00:08:59,592
Look at the wall.

108
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,968
"Christian." We either take that
seriously or we paint over it.

109
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:08,276
You don't admit Michael Oher
because of sports.

110
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:11,505
You admit him because
it's the right thing to do.

111
00:09:56,994 --> 00:09:58,655
Class, this is Mike Oher...

112
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:02,458
...and he's new here so I expect
you all to make him feel welcome.

113
00:10:02,633 --> 00:10:04,828
Mike, just take any empty seat.

114
00:10:08,338 --> 00:10:11,398
This is a quiz based on the information...

115
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:15,067
...you learned last year
in your science curriculum.

116
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:18,009
Don't worry, it's not gonna be graded.

117
00:10:18,182 --> 00:10:20,912
I just wanna see how much information
we need to hit again.

118
00:10:21,084 --> 00:10:23,416
Just answer whatever you know.

119
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:58,050
Thank you.

120
00:11:14,638 --> 00:11:18,199
- Can I leave now?
- Yeah.

121
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:23,441
Take your book.

122
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:43,992
I'm tired
of having someone always in our home.

123
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:45,930
I'm tired of him eating all the food.

124
00:11:46,103 --> 00:11:48,537
Look, man, you gotta be Christian
about this thing.

125
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:50,900
Let somebody else
be Christian about this thing.

126
00:11:51,074 --> 00:11:54,271
Dee, come on, I can’t kick him out
on the street like he's some dog.

127
00:11:54,444 --> 00:11:56,344
Let somebody else
take the responsibility.

128
00:11:56,513 --> 00:11:59,141
What, you want me to go to
Beale Street and drop him off?

129
00:11:59,316 --> 00:12:01,307
When do I have time
just to be with you?

130
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:06,218
All right, all right. Whatever.
You win. I'll take care of it.

131
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:13,161
I don't care if Patrick Ramsey
approved the chair.

132
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,766
He's an NFL quarterback,
not Martha fricking Stewart.

133
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:21,097
Because there is a difference
between Bunny Williams and a La-Z-Boy.

134
00:12:21,271 --> 00:12:23,762
<i>No, see, when MTV Cribs
comes to his house...</i>

135
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:25,806
...he’ll be showing off
his home theater.

136
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:28,501
All I'm gonna see
is a brown Barcalounger.

137
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:31,307
No, listen to me, I'm the designer,
my name is on it.

138
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:34,678
Deliver what I ordered, all right?
Thank you.

139
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:45,052
Yeah!

140
00:12:48,432 --> 00:12:51,026
What’d I miss?
- Collins just got a dig.

141
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:53,829
It's girls' volleyball, Mom.
You didn't miss anything.

142
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,866
Oh!

143
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,976
- Come on, Collins, move your feet.
Good job, Collins.

144
00:13:01,144 --> 00:13:02,236
Go.

145
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:07,545
We'll wait for you outside.

146
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:10,278
Don't double condition in
the shower, you have homework.

147
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:11,921
I'm going to Cannon’s to study.

148
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:17,550
SJ! SJ, do not go in the girls' locker
room again. Come here! SJ, come here!

149
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,275
<i>The big kid's been here
for, what, a month?</i>

150
00:13:33,677 --> 00:13:35,577
He's still not cutting it in my class.

151
00:13:35,746 --> 00:13:39,443
Why does Admissions do this?
I mean, it's not fair to us or the boy.

152
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:41,277
They're just setting him up to fail.

153
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:43,783
I don't think he has any idea
of what I'm teaching.

154
00:13:43,954 --> 00:13:46,445
And how would you know if he did?
He won't even talk.

155
00:13:47,424 --> 00:13:48,448
He writes.

156
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,525
His name. Barely.

157
00:13:51,695 --> 00:13:54,255
He threw this in the trash can.

158
00:13:57,968 --> 00:14:00,801
"I look and I see white everywhere:

159
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:06,136
White walls, white floors,
and a lot of white people.

160
00:14:06,476 --> 00:14:11,743
The teachers do not know I have no idea
of anything they are talking about.

161
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:14,975
I do not wanna listen to anyone,
especially the teachers.

162
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:20,112
They are giving homework and expecting
me to do the problems on my own.

163
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,890
I have never done homework in my life.

164
00:14:23,693 --> 00:14:28,460
I go to the bathroom,
look in the mirror and say:

165
00:14:28,765 --> 00:14:30,460
"This is not Michael Oher."

166
00:14:35,338 --> 00:14:37,431
He entitled it "White Walls."

167
00:14:37,707 --> 00:14:39,572
How's the spelling?

168
00:14:51,488 --> 00:14:52,955
Hi.

169
00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:03,924
Smile at them.
It lets them know you're their friend.

170
00:15:08,872 --> 00:15:10,567
You're Big Mike, right?

171
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:12,968
Well, I'm Sean.

172
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:17,944
But everyone calls me SJ. It's for
Sean Junior. My father's name is Sean.

173
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:22,017
Sean Tuohy? He was a basketball star
at Ole Miss, point guard.

174
00:15:22,185 --> 00:15:24,119
Now he owns like a million Taco Bells.

175
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:36,562
Who is that, SJ?
Big Mike.

176
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:40,561
Get your feet off my dash.

177
00:15:41,638 --> 00:15:43,037
Thank you. Put on your seat belt.

178
00:15:51,982 --> 00:15:53,677
Big Mike?

179
00:15:56,553 --> 00:16:00,751
Mike, I got a call from someone
at the police department.

180
00:16:04,628 --> 00:16:10,692
You remember a story in the papers
a while back about a man who...

181
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:13,335
...fell off an overpass?

182
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:15,698
No one knew who he was.

183
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:20,673
They didn't know if he jumped or if...

184
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:25,909
Well, anyway, he- He passed away.

185
00:16:29,252 --> 00:16:31,982
Mike, that man was your father.

186
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:38,159
They've been looking for
somebody to notify and they-

187
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:41,456
They found your name in our registry.

188
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:45,926
I'm really sorry, son.

189
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,032
Were you close to him?

190
00:16:57,414 --> 00:17:00,076
When's the last time you saw him?

191
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:07,314
I don't know.

192
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:42,713
- He knows it!
- Who knows it and what does he know?

193
00:18:42,986 --> 00:18:46,513
The material. Michael Oher.
I gave him this test verbally.

194
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,057
- Is that even allowed?
- A "C"? On how big a curve?

195
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:53,127
He's been listening all along.
It's amazing what he's absorbed.

196
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:57,357
And, trust me, he's listening to you too.
Now, his reading level is low...

197
00:18:57,534 --> 00:19:01,026
...and he's got no idea
how to learn in a classroom...

198
00:19:01,204 --> 00:19:06,107
I'm not saying he's gonna pass,
but Big Mike is not stupid.

199
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:08,574
Hey. Good job.
Mama. Daddy.

200
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:10,762
Good job.
Hey I got a question for you.

201
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:11,403
Yeah?

202
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:15,312
There was a little girl about two rows
back. What was her name?

203
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:17,680
- Oh, that was Kinsey.
- Kinsey, yeah.

204
00:19:17,854 --> 00:19:20,322
I saw your little Indian feathers
get all ruffled up.

205
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,684
Yeah! She is nice.

206
00:19:21,858 --> 00:19:23,826
SJ. Don't let this go to your head...

207
00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:26,791
...but I thought you were
very convincing in the role of...

208
00:19:26,963 --> 00:19:28,794
- Indian Number 3?
- Yes.

209
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:32,366
I tried out for the chief,
but they gave it to Andy Sung.

210
00:19:32,535 --> 00:19:36,596
I can’t be sure, but I think there's
some multi-cultural-bias thing working.

211
00:19:36,773 --> 00:19:39,469
Or maybe they just thought
that he'd make a better chief.

212
00:19:39,642 --> 00:19:41,439
Dad, he's, like, Chinese.

213
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:43,010
Yeah, and you're Irish.

214
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:45,739
If you weren't the chief,
how did you get the headdress?

215
00:19:45,915 --> 00:19:49,146
Dad, I'm gonna need a few more
of those free quesadilla tickets.

216
00:19:51,621 --> 00:19:53,851
And where does the acorn fall?

217
00:19:54,023 --> 00:19:57,015
Hey, don't laugh too hard.
The quesadillas saved our ass.

218
00:19:57,193 --> 00:19:58,785
Don't use the A-word.

219
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:05,996
What is he wearing?

220
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,435
It's freezing.

221
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:12,040
- What's his name again?
- Big Mike.

222
00:20:12,942 --> 00:20:15,172
Where is he going?

223
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,407
Hey, Big Mike. Where you headed?

224
00:20:19,582 --> 00:20:20,606
Gym.

225
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:22,408
Go ahead.

226
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:35,689
Turn around.

227
00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:44,467
Big Mike!

228
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:46,506
Stop the car.

229
00:20:50,447 --> 00:20:51,539
Big Mike.

230
00:20:52,449 --> 00:20:55,009
Hey. My name's Leigh Anne Tuohy.
My kids go to Wingate.

231
00:20:55,185 --> 00:20:56,812
You said you were going to the gym?

232
00:20:58,354 --> 00:20:59,844
School gym's closed.

233
00:21:00,356 --> 00:21:01,948
Why were you going to the gym?

234
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,394
Big Mike, why were you
going to the gym?

235
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,698
Because it's- It's warm.

236
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:12,998
Do you have anyplace to stay tonight?

237
00:21:14,904 --> 00:21:16,201
Don't you dare lie to me.

238
00:21:29,152 --> 00:21:33,248
I've seen that look many times.
She's about to get her way.

239
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,248
Come on.

240
00:21:37,694 --> 00:21:39,127
Come on.

241
00:21:42,332 --> 00:21:44,266
SJ, make room.

242
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:46,095
Get inside.

243
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:49,294
Come on.

244
00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:03,115
- Where we going?
- Home.

245
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:22,863
I know, it's my favorite part.
He's so cute.

246
00:22:23,306 --> 00:22:25,399
How'd the dork do in the school play?

247
00:22:30,013 --> 00:22:31,310
Um...

248
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:32,641
Okay.

249
00:22:33,082 --> 00:22:36,074
Collins, do you know Big Mike
from school?

250
00:22:37,587 --> 00:22:41,284
I'd give you the guest bedroom,
but it's full of sample boxes.

251
00:22:41,457 --> 00:22:44,756
And the sectional in the family room
slides apart when you sleep on it.

252
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:47,123
Least that’s what Sean says.

253
00:22:47,297 --> 00:22:49,060
Mr. Tuohy sleeps on the couch?

254
00:22:49,332 --> 00:22:50,924
Only when he's bad. All right.

255
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,469
The powder room is right there and we
will be upstairs if you need us. All right?

256
00:22:56,172 --> 00:22:59,266
Okay. Sleep tight, honey.

257
00:23:52,562 --> 00:23:54,052
<i>Was this a bad idea?</i>

258
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,354
What?

259
00:23:55,531 --> 00:23:58,967
Don't lie there and pretend like you're
not thinking the same thing as me.

260
00:23:59,135 --> 00:24:02,627
Tell me what you're thinking so I'll know
what's supposed to be on my mind.

261
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:04,932
How well do you know Big Mike?

262
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:07,576
Case you hadn't noticed,
he didn't have much to say.

263
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:10,304
What's the big deal?
It's just for one night, right?

264
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:14,809
It is just for one night,
right, Leigh Anne?

265
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,820
You don't think he'll steal anything,
do you?

266
00:24:20,957 --> 00:24:23,425
I guess we'll know in the morning.

267
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:37,506
<i>...talking about Mississippi and Arkansas.</i>

268
00:24:37,674 --> 00:24:39,141
<i>The fight's gotten more interesting.</i>

269
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:42,675
Well, if you hear a scream,
call the insurance adjuster.

270
00:25:02,131 --> 00:25:03,860
Mike?

271
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:15,370
Big Mike?

272
00:25:15,912 --> 00:25:17,675
Mike?

273
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:32,457
Big Mike!

274
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,299
You gonna make me
walk the whole way?

275
00:25:43,072 --> 00:25:45,063
All right, then.

276
00:25:45,575 --> 00:25:46,974
Where are you going?

277
00:25:47,877 --> 00:25:48,901
I don't know.

278
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:53,609
Well, are you spending Thanksgiving
with your family?

279
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:56,612
<i>Those 40, 50 guys
from State here can quiet them down.</i>

280
00:25:56,786 --> 00:25:59,220
<i>As you mentioned,
the Mississippi State defensive-</i>

281
00:25:59,388 --> 00:26:01,253
- Come and get it, y'all.
- Yeah, baby!

282
00:26:01,424 --> 00:26:03,016
Let's eat!

283
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,656
Come on!

284
00:26:05,495 --> 00:26:06,553
It's that Rebel turkey.

285
00:26:07,497 --> 00:26:10,330
Thank your mother for driving
to the store and getting this.

286
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,161
Thank you, Mama.
- Thank you, Mama.

287
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:15,270
Food and football.
Eat all you want.

288
00:26:15,438 --> 00:26:18,498
Come on. Hustle, hustle.
We gotta get back over there.

289
00:26:18,674 --> 00:26:20,369
Going, Dad.

290
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,175
Don't take my spot.

291
00:26:22,345 --> 00:26:24,813
- No rushing, SJ. SJ, slow down.
- Coming through.

292
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:28,473
No.
This is fantastic.

293
00:26:29,652 --> 00:26:33,679
Oh, y’all, I forgot
the potato salad. How's Ole Miss doing?

294
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,347
They're kicking butt.

295
00:26:36,993 --> 00:26:39,052
<i>One wide receiver left...
Good, huh?</i>

296
00:26:39,228 --> 00:26:42,288
<i>...and one corner, number 30,
out in press coverage-</i>

297
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:44,490
Sean, salad.

298
00:26:45,635 --> 00:26:47,500
It's great, Mom.
So good. Thanks, Mama.

299
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,762
Yeah, Mama.

300
00:26:48,938 --> 00:26:51,998
<i>Nice little surge,
but not much running inside.</i>

301
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:54,541
<i>Come on.
- And the Rebels got third and long here.</i>

302
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,237
<i>Birdsong and Mawhinney on the tackle.
Ole Miss, five of 10 on third downs.</i>

303
00:26:58,414 --> 00:27:01,076
<i>From the 26, third down and six
for the Rebs here.</i>

304
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,274
Come on, defense.

305
00:27:02,451 --> 00:27:05,579
<i>I formation. The rain is slow,
let's see if they try a pass or not.</i>

306
00:27:05,755 --> 00:27:08,155
<i>Now Turner goes in motion
out of the backfield.</i>

307
00:27:08,324 --> 00:27:10,087
<i>State showing blitz, Manning to throw.</i>

308
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:13,558
<i>Runs to his right,
throws it at the feet of the-</i>

309
00:27:13,729 --> 00:27:15,424
- Hey. Mom.
- What?

310
00:27:15,598 --> 00:27:17,429
But it's Thanksgiving.

311
00:27:19,235 --> 00:27:22,329
- Wow.
- Why are we eating in here?

312
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:30,944
Shall we say grace?

313
00:27:48,598 --> 00:27:53,865
Heavenly Father, we thank you for
all the many blessings on this family.

314
00:27:54,036 --> 00:27:56,698
We thank you for bringing us
a new friend.

315
00:27:57,373 --> 00:28:00,536
And we ask that you look after us
on this holiday season...

316
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:05,579
...that we may never forget
how very fortunate we are. Amen.

317
00:28:05,748 --> 00:28:07,238
Amen.

318
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:12,153
Let's check the score.
Up by 10.

319
00:28:13,589 --> 00:28:16,387
Collins, can you pass me
the green beans, please?

320
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:21,125
Don't pick it with your fingers.
Just take- Take a sp- Ta-

321
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:26,462
- SJ, elbows.
- Sorry.

322
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:32,799
So, Big Mike. You like to shop?

323
00:28:34,744 --> 00:28:37,679
Because tomorrow I think I'm gonna
have to show you how it's done.

324
00:28:43,085 --> 00:28:44,950
I got clothes.

325
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:47,180
You have clothes.

326
00:28:47,356 --> 00:28:50,848
And an extra T-shirt in a plastic bag
does not a wardrobe make.

327
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,784
I have clothes.

328
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:55,954
Fine, let's go get them.
Just tell me where I'm going.

329
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:07,266
All right.

330
00:29:08,077 --> 00:29:13,606
Tell me everything I need to know about
you. Who takes care of you? A mother?

331
00:29:13,783 --> 00:29:17,913
Do you have a mother?
A grandmother maybe?

332
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:26,455
Tell you what, Big Mike, we can do this
the easy way or we can do this the hard way.

333
00:29:26,629 --> 00:29:28,563
You take your pick.

334
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,033
Fine.

335
00:29:33,336 --> 00:29:39,036
Tell me just one thing I should know
about you. Just- Just one.

336
00:29:41,277 --> 00:29:43,370
I don't like to be called Big Mike.

337
00:29:45,081 --> 00:29:46,480
Okay.

338
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:50,717
Tell you what, from now on,
to me, you're Michael.

339
00:29:51,187 --> 00:29:52,745
Okay?

340
00:29:54,357 --> 00:29:56,518
So, Michael...

341
00:29:58,594 --> 00:30:00,186
...where are we headed?

342
00:30:00,363 --> 00:30:04,026
I kid y’all not, y’all. I'm gonna
tell it. Make it rain and everything, right?

343
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,637
Shorty- Shorty gets to the top of the pole.
She just done-

344
00:30:12,174 --> 00:30:14,142
That's nice.
Yo, check it.

345
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,302
What's that, a seven?
For real.

346
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,243
Yeah.

347
00:30:19,915 --> 00:30:21,212
Yeah, right there.

348
00:30:21,384 --> 00:30:24,410
- You know them?
- Man, I ain't got no idea, shorty.

349
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:26,953
This is where your mother lives?

350
00:30:27,356 --> 00:30:30,120
- Let's go get them.
- Don't- Don't get out.

351
00:30:30,292 --> 00:30:32,852
Who's gonna help you
carry your clothes, Michael?

352
00:30:36,132 --> 00:30:38,191
Don't get out the car.

353
00:30:44,673 --> 00:30:46,402
Snowflake.

354
00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:49,409
Oh. That's Big Mike, man.

355
00:30:50,046 --> 00:30:52,844
Oh, Big Mike is in the house.

356
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,577
Big Mike! Where you been, baby?

357
00:30:59,488 --> 00:31:04,152
Hey, who that fine thing you got driving you
around now, like Miss Daisy or something?

358
00:31:04,326 --> 00:31:05,657
Hey, David.

359
00:31:05,828 --> 00:31:09,924
You need to holler at me about them
sneakers, man. I'm gonna take care of you.

360
00:31:13,102 --> 00:31:15,900
I run this over here in Hurt Village.
Baby, believe that.

361
00:31:19,742 --> 00:31:24,042
Ey. Hey, D, watch this. They always
go for the wink, watch this.

362
00:31:24,213 --> 00:31:27,307
There you go. Yeah, snowflake. Ha-ha-ha.

363
00:31:27,683 --> 00:31:30,413
You like that. Yeah.

364
00:32:06,021 --> 00:32:09,923
That girl will not listen to me.
She don't listen to nobody.

365
00:32:10,092 --> 00:32:12,959
- Hey, Mike.
- Hi, Big Mike.

366
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,135
<i>She wasn't home.</i>

367
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:29,209
Well, we can come back.

368
00:32:32,081 --> 00:32:35,107
She probably moved to a nicer place.

369
00:32:45,828 --> 00:32:50,060
I've been in Memphis my whole life
and never been anywhere near here.

370
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,636
- You're gonna take care of me, right?
I got your back.

371
00:32:58,841 --> 00:33:01,366
Now just follow me, y’all. Uh-huh.

372
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:03,102
There we go.

373
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,305
Oh, we also got apparel for the ladies.

374
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:09,940
But everything we got that'll fit him
is right here.

375
00:33:12,588 --> 00:33:13,680
This is it?

376
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:17,288
If this is all you got, why's it say
"Big and Tall" on the sign?

377
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:20,860
Big and Tall. You need
Bigger and Taller.

378
00:33:22,932 --> 00:33:25,059
- Holler if you need me.
Thank you.

379
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:29,728
- See anything you like?
- Hey, I got just what you're looking for.

380
00:33:29,905 --> 00:33:31,896
One thing I know about shopping
is that...

381
00:33:32,074 --> 00:33:34,838
...if you don't love it in the store,
you won't wear it.

382
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,978
The store's where you like it the best.

383
00:33:37,146 --> 00:33:40,445
So before you choose something,
think of yourself wearing it.

384
00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:43,744
Say to yourself, "Is this me?"

385
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:48,586
What about this one?

386
00:33:52,962 --> 00:33:56,420
Well, this is not atrocious, this...

387
00:33:56,832 --> 00:34:00,632
No? All right, well, you go look
over there and I'll go look over here.

388
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:07,636
Why would you need this many coats
out of plastic?

389
00:34:09,912 --> 00:34:14,144
Good Lord. What is this made out of?

390
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:22,982
That's the one? That's the one you like?

391
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:26,986
Well, all right, then.

392
00:34:40,943 --> 00:34:43,503
Have a great day! Learn something.

393
00:34:52,054 --> 00:34:54,113
Oh, don't get your panties in a wad.

394
00:34:56,859 --> 00:34:59,657
The best part about Paris was the food.

395
00:34:59,828 --> 00:35:02,228
They use sauce like we use gravy.

396
00:35:02,398 --> 00:35:05,663
- I had to join a gym the day I got back.
Oh.

397
00:35:07,236 --> 00:35:09,830
Have y’all spent much time
on the other side of town?

398
00:35:10,005 --> 00:35:13,304
- Where exactly are you talking about?
- Alabama Street, Hurt Village.

399
00:35:13,475 --> 00:35:15,807
Hurt Village? That sounds like a threat.

400
00:35:15,978 --> 00:35:17,411
Not far off.

401
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:19,843
I think it might hurt me to go there.

402
00:35:20,015 --> 00:35:21,915
It would hurt your reputation
to go there.

403
00:35:22,084 --> 00:35:25,576
Actually, I'm from there but didn't mind
hard work, and look where I am now.

404
00:35:25,754 --> 00:35:27,415
Eating an $18 salad?

405
00:35:29,124 --> 00:35:30,887
And it's a little soggy, to be honest.

406
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,655
What is this sudden interest in the projects?
Another one of your "charities"?

407
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:38,960
Wait. Project for the projects.
Ooh. That's catchy!

408
00:35:39,134 --> 00:35:40,692
Y'all, money would raise itself.

409
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:42,996
Okay. Count me in, Leigh Anne.

410
00:35:44,373 --> 00:35:47,069
- Break out your checkbooks.
Yes.

411
00:35:47,242 --> 00:35:50,803
SJ, you have two more minutes
on that Playbox thing, all right?

412
00:35:50,979 --> 00:35:53,004
Aw, Mom!
- There you go.

413
00:35:57,486 --> 00:35:59,954
Michael, do you wanna stay here?

414
00:36:02,658 --> 00:36:07,027
I mean, because if you wanna stay here
for a while longer...

415
00:36:07,196 --> 00:36:12,065
...I can find some time to
figure out a bedroom for you.

416
00:36:13,435 --> 00:36:15,130
I mean, because look at this.

417
00:36:15,304 --> 00:36:18,603
You have practically ruined
a $10,000 couch.

418
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,439
Do you wanna stay here, Michael?

419
00:36:29,051 --> 00:36:31,542
I don't wanna go anyplace else.

420
00:36:36,925 --> 00:36:38,654
Well, all right, then.

421
00:36:41,563 --> 00:36:43,554
SJ, you better be off that Playbox.

422
00:36:43,732 --> 00:36:45,893
That wasn't two minutes.

423
00:36:46,535 --> 00:36:48,833
Good night, Mrs. Tuohy.

424
00:36:54,543 --> 00:36:57,979
I see on the admission that we're
Michael’s contact for medical emergencies.

425
00:36:58,147 --> 00:36:59,739
Sean wrote that in last week.

426
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:03,009
We needed a contact number and
the ones listed weren't in service.

427
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:05,914
I love that man.

428
00:37:06,989 --> 00:37:08,081
What's this?

429
00:37:09,258 --> 00:37:13,160
The state makes schools measure
for career aptitude in the eighth grade...

430
00:37:13,328 --> 00:37:16,388
- ...and this just came with his file.
- What's it say about Michael?

431
00:37:16,565 --> 00:37:19,329
Spatial relations, third percentile.

432
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:22,766
Ability to learn, fifth percentile.

433
00:37:22,938 --> 00:37:27,432
It's funny though. He tested in
the 98th percentile in one category.

434
00:37:27,609 --> 00:37:30,476
- Which one?
- Protective instincts.

435
00:37:33,048 --> 00:37:37,451
So over here you have a desk,
chest of drawers...

436
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:40,713
...you have a nightstand, a light,
an alarm.

437
00:37:40,889 --> 00:37:44,518
Sean says all pro athletes use futons
if they can’t find a bed big enough...

438
00:37:44,693 --> 00:37:47,560
...so I got you one of those.
Of course the frame was heinous.

439
00:37:47,729 --> 00:37:51,130
I was not about to let that in my house,
but I got you something nicer.

440
00:37:52,901 --> 00:37:56,064
- It's mine?
- Yes, sir.

441
00:37:57,139 --> 00:37:59,903
- What?
- Never had one before.

442
00:38:00,642 --> 00:38:02,405
What, a room to yourself?

443
00:38:03,145 --> 00:38:04,806
A bed.

444
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:16,817
Well, you have one now.

445
00:38:48,524 --> 00:38:51,425
Okay. Define osmosis.

446
00:38:52,127 --> 00:38:54,391
I think I know that one.

447
00:38:55,097 --> 00:38:58,726
It's when water passes through
a barrier.

448
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:01,392
That's basically right, Michael.
Very good.

449
00:39:09,177 --> 00:39:13,113
Name the combatants
in the Battle of Waterloo.

450
00:39:13,282 --> 00:39:16,012
I know that one. Um...

451
00:39:16,184 --> 00:39:17,947
- The little guy, Napoleon.
- Uh-huh.

452
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,113
He was on one side
and a duke was on the other.

453
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:23,781
Duke of Wellington.

454
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:27,019
Yeah, and the Duke of Wellington,
he had Russians helping him.

455
00:39:27,195 --> 00:39:28,219
Prussians.

456
00:39:42,477 --> 00:39:47,210
Enough with the rugby shirts.
You look like a giant bumblebee.

457
00:39:49,551 --> 00:39:50,779
That Taco Bell.

458
00:39:50,953 --> 00:39:54,719
KFC catty-corner. And
the Long John Silver’s on the next block.

459
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,914
You own all of them?

460
00:39:56,091 --> 00:39:58,821
- Yeah. We've got like hundreds.
- Eighty-five.

461
00:39:59,094 --> 00:40:01,289
Is that why Mr. Tuohy
don't have to go to work?

462
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:05,489
Whoa, whoa! Hey! I'm working even
when I'm not working.

463
00:40:06,234 --> 00:40:09,328
- What?
- And you eat at all these places for free?

464
00:40:09,504 --> 00:40:11,472
All you want. It's awesome.

465
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,575
What do y’all do with all
the leftover food from the restaurant?

466
00:40:14,743 --> 00:40:17,109
We have to throw some out,
what's already cooked.

467
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:20,077
- That's too bad.
- Yeah, I'd rather sell it.

468
00:40:20,248 --> 00:40:22,580
Seems like you could give it away
or something.

469
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:26,551
- You should check into that, Daddy.
All right, I will, SJ.

470
00:40:26,722 --> 00:40:29,520
How come we're not eating
at one of your restaurants tonight?

471
00:40:29,691 --> 00:40:33,149
- Well, because tonight is a special occasion.
What?

472
00:40:33,695 --> 00:40:37,153
I talked to Coach Cotton. He said
Michael’s grades have improved enough...

473
00:40:37,332 --> 00:40:40,165
...that he can go out
for spring football in March.

474
00:40:40,335 --> 00:40:43,702
- Isn't that great?
- Oh, man! You're gonna crush some people!

475
00:40:51,046 --> 00:40:53,844
- Hey, guys, how we doing?
- Great, thank you.

476
00:40:54,716 --> 00:40:58,174
I've got a design book I need to get.
Why don't you check our reservation?

477
00:40:58,353 --> 00:41:00,253
They'll seat us right away.
Can't it wait?

478
00:41:00,422 --> 00:41:02,890
They might be closed by then.
Come on, SJ!

479
00:41:03,058 --> 00:41:04,582
I need some new magazines.

480
00:41:06,962 --> 00:41:08,862
Michael, come on. Come on.

481
00:41:20,008 --> 00:41:23,341
Collins? Collins?

482
00:41:23,812 --> 00:41:26,337
Collins, come on, your dad's
already PO'd. Let's go.

483
00:41:26,515 --> 00:41:27,709
Over here.

484
00:41:36,091 --> 00:41:40,790
You remember this one, Mom?
You read it to us like a thousand times.

485
00:41:41,196 --> 00:41:44,893
"He gnashed his terrible teeth
and he roared his terrible roar."

486
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:47,867
I always liked this one.

487
00:41:48,036 --> 00:41:49,401
<i>Mm. Ferdinand.</i>

488
00:41:49,705 --> 00:41:51,536
Me too.

489
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:55,232
Michael, your mama ever read
either one of those books to you?

490
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,038
No?

491
00:42:00,749 --> 00:42:02,307
How cute!

492
00:42:02,484 --> 00:42:03,974
It was a good steak, huh?

493
00:42:04,152 --> 00:42:05,141
Thank you, Daddy.

494
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,878
Thank you for a lovely dinner, Papa.

495
00:42:07,055 --> 00:42:08,420
Here we go.

496
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:48,358
Michael. Who was that boy
you were talking to at the restaurant?

497
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,498
Marcus.

498
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:55,262
- Marcus, and he- He works there?
- Yeah.

499
00:42:56,371 --> 00:42:58,202
How do you know him?

500
00:42:59,741 --> 00:43:01,936
He's my brother.

501
00:43:08,483 --> 00:43:11,384
Well, we'd really- We'd really
like to meet him someday.

502
00:43:12,621 --> 00:43:14,919
Would that be okay with you?

503
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,324
I don't know where he stays.

504
00:43:18,026 --> 00:43:20,517
When was the last time you saw him?

505
00:43:23,365 --> 00:43:24,923
When I was little, maybe.

506
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:33,632
<i>"Once upon a time in Spain,
there was a little bull...</i>

507
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:36,972
...and his name was Ferdinand.

508
00:43:37,345 --> 00:43:40,644
All the other little bulls he lived with
would run and jump...

509
00:43:40,816 --> 00:43:43,546
...and butt their heads together.

510
00:43:44,186 --> 00:43:46,711
But not Ferdinand.

511
00:43:47,889 --> 00:43:53,691
He liked to sit just quietly
and smell the flowers.

512
00:43:54,796 --> 00:43:58,596
He had a favorite spot out
in the pasture under a cork tree.

513
00:44:00,202 --> 00:44:02,329
<i>It was his favorite tree...</i>

514
00:44:02,504 --> 00:44:08,067
<i>...and he would sit in its shade
all day and smell the flowers. "</i>

515
00:44:08,243 --> 00:44:11,007
- Good night.
- Good night.

516
00:44:13,381 --> 00:44:15,975
- What?
- What?

517
00:44:16,251 --> 00:44:18,378
Why are you smiling?

518
00:44:18,653 --> 00:44:23,022
I don't know, I'm just happy.
Real happy.

519
00:44:23,191 --> 00:44:26,160
Does this happiness have anything
to do with Michael?

520
00:44:26,328 --> 00:44:27,955
No.

521
00:44:28,763 --> 00:44:31,664
It has everything to do with Michael.

522
00:44:33,034 --> 00:44:35,525
Mm. Mm.

523
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:37,738
- Happy's good.
- Mm.

524
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,367
You know what I think we should do?

525
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:43,340
We should start a charity
for kids like Michael.

526
00:44:43,511 --> 00:44:45,945
- Okay.
- Maybe fund a program at Wingate.

527
00:44:46,114 --> 00:44:47,138
Sure.

528
00:44:47,315 --> 00:44:49,579
Lord knows that school
could use a little color.

529
00:44:49,751 --> 00:44:53,346
Poor Michael’s like a fly in the milk
in that place.

530
00:44:53,521 --> 00:44:55,421
Are you listening to me?

531
00:44:57,259 --> 00:45:01,889
- Hmm?
- I try to concentrate on one...

532
00:45:02,697 --> 00:45:04,358
...thing...

533
00:45:04,799 --> 00:45:06,460
...at a time.

534
00:45:06,635 --> 00:45:08,330
You knew I was a multitasker...

535
00:45:08,503 --> 00:45:09,868
...when you married me, right?

536
00:45:10,038 --> 00:45:14,099
- I sure did.
- Right. Okay, just checking.

537
00:45:17,913 --> 00:45:22,282
Okay, Tuohy family.
Big smiles, everyone.

538
00:45:23,084 --> 00:45:26,986
And one, two, three!

539
00:45:29,424 --> 00:45:30,448
Michael.

540
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:32,752
Come on down here
and get in the next one.

541
00:45:32,961 --> 00:45:35,953
Come on. Come on. Come on down.

542
00:45:41,303 --> 00:45:44,363
Oh, come on. It's not like I'm gonna
put it on the Christmas card.

543
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:48,839
Okay, let's scootch in a little tighter.

544
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:50,534
That's good.

545
00:45:51,313 --> 00:45:52,644
Really big smiles.

546
00:45:52,814 --> 00:45:55,476
Okay, one, two, three.

547
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:57,447
- Say "Rebels!"
Rebels!

548
00:46:01,656 --> 00:46:04,181
<i>- a blitz off
the corner, quick pass over the middle.</i>

549
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:08,625
<i>- The hot route was there. And that's...
I got it.</i>

550
00:46:09,297 --> 00:46:11,629
- Who's winning?
- Tennessee.

551
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,462
- Ugh. Who they playing?
- Clemson.

552
00:46:14,636 --> 00:46:17,298
Your mama roots against Tennessee
no matter who they play?

553
00:46:17,472 --> 00:46:19,906
Uh- Yes, I do. With gusto.

554
00:46:20,075 --> 00:46:21,975
She can’t stand Tennessee.

555
00:46:22,143 --> 00:46:25,203
Collie-bell, I thought you were
going over to your boyfriend's.

556
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,245
Thought I'd hang around here
for the day.

557
00:46:28,116 --> 00:46:29,549
Hmm.

558
00:46:29,784 --> 00:46:31,342
I like that.

559
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:34,420
There's a couple messages on the machine.
I didn't check them.

560
00:46:34,589 --> 00:46:36,022
All right.

561
00:46:36,992 --> 00:46:40,393
<i>Hey, Sean, hey, Leigh Anne, it's
your cousin Bobby. Happy New Year's.</i>

562
00:46:40,628 --> 00:46:43,495
- Listen, I've had about five cold ones...
- Of course you have.

563
00:46:43,665 --> 00:46:45,724
<i>...so I'm just gonna go ahead and ask:</i>

564
00:46:46,301 --> 00:46:49,634
Did y’all know there's a colored boy
in your Christmas card?

565
00:46:52,674 --> 00:46:54,403
What?

566
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:58,002
You just looked teeny-tiny next to him.

567
00:46:58,179 --> 00:47:00,147
Right? Like Jessica Lange and King Kong.

568
00:47:01,549 --> 00:47:04,143
Hey, does Michael get
the family discount at Taco Bell?

569
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,846
Because if he does,
Sean's gonna lose a few stores.

570
00:47:08,023 --> 00:47:09,081
He's a good kid.

571
00:47:09,257 --> 00:47:12,192
Well, I say you make it official
and just adopt him.

572
00:47:13,962 --> 00:47:18,262
He's gonna be 18 in a few months. Doesn't
really make much sense to legally adopt.

573
00:47:21,436 --> 00:47:22,460
Leigh Anne.

574
00:47:22,937 --> 00:47:25,462
Is this some sort of white-guilt thing?

575
00:47:25,807 --> 00:47:28,105
What will your daddy say?

576
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:32,109
Um... Before or after
he turns over in his grave?

577
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,748
Daddy's been gone five years, Elaine.

578
00:47:34,916 --> 00:47:38,044
Make matters worse, you were
at the funeral. Remember?

579
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:40,585
You wore Chanel
and that awful black hat.

580
00:47:40,755 --> 00:47:42,552
Look, here's the deal.

581
00:47:42,724 --> 00:47:45,955
I don't need y’all to approve
my choices, all right?

582
00:47:46,127 --> 00:47:50,291
But I do ask that you respect them. You
have no idea what this boy's been through.

583
00:47:50,465 --> 00:47:53,127
And if this is gonna become
some running diatribe...

584
00:47:53,301 --> 00:47:55,997
...I can find an overpriced salad
a lot closer to home.

585
00:47:58,006 --> 00:48:01,373
- Leigh Anne, I'm sorry. We didn't intend to-
- No, we didn't, really.

586
00:48:01,543 --> 00:48:04,774
I think what you're doing is so great.

587
00:48:04,946 --> 00:48:07,710
To open up your home to him?

588
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:10,347
Honey, you're changing that boy's life.

589
00:48:11,186 --> 00:48:12,778
No.

590
00:48:13,321 --> 00:48:14,913
He's changing mine.

591
00:48:16,491 --> 00:48:18,823
And that’s awesome for you,
but what about Collins?

592
00:48:20,662 --> 00:48:22,960
- What about Collins?
Aren't you worried?

593
00:48:23,131 --> 00:48:24,826
I mean, even just a little?

594
00:48:24,999 --> 00:48:29,436
He's a boy, a large, black boy,
sleeping under the same roof.

595
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,437
Shame on you.

596
00:48:38,646 --> 00:48:39,977
I've got this.

597
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:43,880
<i>Be honest with me, okay?</i>

598
00:48:45,787 --> 00:48:49,450
Does Michael being here
make you uncomfortable?

599
00:48:50,091 --> 00:48:53,527
They're stupid kids.
Who cares what they say?

600
00:48:53,695 --> 00:48:56,858
- What kids?
- At school.

601
00:48:57,365 --> 00:48:58,696
They're juvenile.

602
00:48:58,867 --> 00:49:00,892
And what do the juvenile kids say?

603
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:04,200
It's really not worth repeating.

604
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,240
And don't worry about SJ.

605
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:11,740
He likes all the attention. He introduces
Michael as his big brother.

606
00:49:16,451 --> 00:49:17,816
And what about you?

607
00:49:18,219 --> 00:49:20,187
It's fine.

608
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:25,084
I mean, you can’t just throw him
out on the street.

609
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,421
I could make other arrangements.

610
00:49:31,432 --> 00:49:33,992
Hi, Mike.
- Hi. Need a push?

611
00:49:34,169 --> 00:49:35,796
Yes.

612
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:43,400
Oh.
Higher, Mike, higher!

613
00:49:47,215 --> 00:49:49,206
Higher!

614
00:49:53,421 --> 00:49:55,582
Higher!

615
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:02,388
Don't look down, don't look down. Ah!

616
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:38,599
- Where are you going?
- Collins?

617
00:50:50,211 --> 00:50:52,509
Quit looking at me like that.

618
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,615
I mean, we study together at home.

619
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:16,793
You know how much those things weigh?
This kid's gonna make us all famous.

620
00:51:18,506 --> 00:51:22,738
Easy, Bert, man. It's only the spring.
He hasn't even had his first practice yet.

621
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:24,935
No, he's a player.

622
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,870
Break!

623
00:51:27,348 --> 00:51:29,316
Ready.
Break!

624
00:51:29,917 --> 00:51:33,580
Get down, son.
Get down in your stance. In your stance!

625
00:51:33,855 --> 00:51:34,879
Go!

626
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:39,856
Shuck him, shuck him! Ah, ah-

627
00:51:40,928 --> 00:51:44,022
Mike, son, you-
You fought off the block...

628
00:51:44,198 --> 00:51:46,530
...but then you wanna shuck
the blocker.

629
00:51:46,701 --> 00:51:49,670
All right? Shuck him. All right, let's go.

630
00:51:50,471 --> 00:51:52,200
Huddle up.

631
00:51:52,373 --> 00:51:54,102
Papa.

632
00:51:55,476 --> 00:51:56,875
How's he doing?

633
00:51:57,045 --> 00:51:58,569
Hasn't quite gotten the hang of it yet.

634
00:52:06,721 --> 00:52:07,813
Mike, son.

635
00:52:07,989 --> 00:52:10,082
Shuck the blocker, don't tote him!

636
00:52:10,258 --> 00:52:12,192
Set, go!

637
00:52:13,594 --> 00:52:17,223
No, no, no! No, no, no!

638
00:52:17,965 --> 00:52:19,523
Set, go!

639
00:52:28,242 --> 00:52:30,039
Balloons! They're balloons!

640
00:52:30,678 --> 00:52:33,613
Guys, quit looking at the balloons.
Everybody!

641
00:52:33,781 --> 00:52:36,648
Most kids from bad situations
can’t wait to be violent...

642
00:52:36,818 --> 00:52:38,445
...and that comes out on the field.

643
00:52:38,619 --> 00:52:41,782
But this kid, he acts like
he doesn't wanna hit anyone.

644
00:52:41,956 --> 00:52:43,856
He's Ferdinand the Bull.

645
00:52:44,025 --> 00:52:45,754
What?
- Nothing.

646
00:52:47,261 --> 00:52:51,823
I thought he was gonna be a player. I can’t
believe I used up all my chips to get him in.

647
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:54,160
I thought you said
it was your Christian duty.

648
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:58,566
Look, Bert, he's never even played before.

649
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,939
Yeah, and he won't this fall if he
doesn't improve a lot before then.

650
00:53:03,277 --> 00:53:05,142
Who died and made him Bear Bryant?

651
00:53:06,848 --> 00:53:08,213
Unbelievable.

652
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:11,477
Oh, God bless me.

653
00:53:11,652 --> 00:53:13,313
This is your summer workout sheet.

654
00:53:13,488 --> 00:53:15,718
Now, first it says to warm up
and get loose.

655
00:53:16,657 --> 00:53:18,420
Well, go ahead, get loose.

656
00:53:21,295 --> 00:53:22,853
Are you loose?

657
00:53:23,231 --> 00:53:26,997
Okay. Next, it's five 100-yard runs
to stretch out your legs.

658
00:53:27,168 --> 00:53:29,432
- Can we just go home and play video games?
- Look!

659
00:53:29,604 --> 00:53:32,767
Everybody at Wingate is expecting you
to be a star football player.

660
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,567
Don't wanna let them down,
do you?

661
00:53:34,742 --> 00:53:36,676
- I don't know.
- What about Dad and Mom?

662
00:53:36,844 --> 00:53:39,506
Because, you see, in our family,
everyone's an athlete.

663
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,741
Dad was a basketball star.
Collins plays volleyball and runs track.

664
00:53:43,918 --> 00:53:46,250
And me, well, as you know, I do it all.

665
00:53:46,421 --> 00:53:48,912
And Mom- Well, Mom was a cheerleader...

666
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:52,821
...which doesn't exactly count,
but don't tell her I said that. Okay?

667
00:53:52,994 --> 00:53:55,155
- Okay.
- Okay.

668
00:53:56,764 --> 00:53:59,824
- Yeah. Fifty.
Uhn.

669
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:01,935
Fifty-one.

670
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:05,603
Fifty-two. Fifty-three.

671
00:54:05,807 --> 00:54:08,970
Come on, you can get him.
Go, go, go! Come on!

672
00:54:09,143 --> 00:54:10,633
Five seconds left in the game!

673
00:54:12,513 --> 00:54:13,980
This way!

674
00:54:14,148 --> 00:54:15,308
This way!

675
00:54:15,483 --> 00:54:19,920
High knees, high knees, high knees!
Speed kills, baby! Run like the wind!

676
00:54:21,289 --> 00:54:22,916
Go, Michael, go!

677
00:54:23,124 --> 00:54:24,955
Ninety-eight.

678
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:26,383
Ninety-nine.

679
00:54:28,229 --> 00:54:29,526
One hundred.

680
00:54:29,697 --> 00:54:32,393
Move your feet, move your feet!
Come on, come on! Go!

681
00:54:32,567 --> 00:54:33,898
- There you go.
- Ahh!

682
00:54:34,068 --> 00:54:36,468
You gotta get the tackle,
come on, come on, come on!

683
00:54:37,205 --> 00:54:38,467
Come on, Michael.

684
00:55:03,097 --> 00:55:04,121
Mrs. Tuohy?

685
00:55:04,298 --> 00:55:07,734
I hear "Mrs. Tuohy," I look over
my shoulder for my mother-in-law.

686
00:55:07,902 --> 00:55:11,030
Call me Leigh Anne or Mama
or almost anything else.

687
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:17,167
- Can you help me get something?
- What?

688
00:55:19,614 --> 00:55:20,842
Driver's license.

689
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:26,083
Why do you need a driver's license
when you don't even have a car?

690
00:55:33,528 --> 00:55:36,053
Michael, why do you want
a driver's license?

691
00:55:36,764 --> 00:55:39,631
It's something to carry
with my name on it.

692
00:55:46,874 --> 00:55:49,399
There's no one by the name of
Michael Oher in the system.

693
00:55:49,577 --> 00:55:51,977
Another last name, perhaps?

694
00:55:54,215 --> 00:55:56,911
Look, I will sign something
that says he lives with us.

695
00:55:57,084 --> 00:56:00,144
We'll pay for all of the insurance.
Whatever it takes. Okay?

696
00:56:01,122 --> 00:56:02,316
What's it gonna take?

697
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:05,220
You wanna do what?
- You heard me.

698
00:56:05,393 --> 00:56:08,658
- Shouldn’t we at least talk about this?
- What do you think we're doing?

699
00:56:08,829 --> 00:56:10,922
And don't act like
I'm going behind your back.

700
00:56:11,098 --> 00:56:14,625
I know you put us down as
Michael’s medical contact at school.

701
00:56:14,802 --> 00:56:17,737
There is a huge difference
between paying for a broken arm...

702
00:56:17,905 --> 00:56:21,602
...and being legally responsible for
someone. I mean, a kid we barely know.

703
00:56:21,776 --> 00:56:25,075
That's another thing. We need to
find out more about his past.

704
00:56:25,246 --> 00:56:29,307
He won't talk about it. He's like an onion.
You have to peel him back a layer at a time.

705
00:56:29,483 --> 00:56:31,747
Not if you use a knife.

706
00:56:32,453 --> 00:56:35,616
What if we took him to a child
psychologist or something?

707
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:38,452
- Do you really expect Big Mike to-?
- Michael.

708
00:56:38,626 --> 00:56:40,560
Do you expect Michael
to lie on a couch...

709
00:56:40,728 --> 00:56:43,253
...and talk about his childhood
like he's Woody Allen?

710
00:56:43,431 --> 00:56:46,093
I mean, Michael’s gift
is his ability to forget.

711
00:56:46,267 --> 00:56:50,226
He's mad at no one and he really
doesn't care what happened in the past.

712
00:56:50,871 --> 00:56:51,997
You're right.

713
00:56:52,707 --> 00:56:55,972
Excuse me? "You're right"?

714
00:56:56,143 --> 00:56:58,611
How'd those words taste
coming out of your mouth?

715
00:56:58,779 --> 00:57:00,212
Like vinegar.

716
00:57:09,056 --> 00:57:11,786
Well, at least promise me
you'll think about it.

717
00:57:11,959 --> 00:57:13,756
All right.

718
00:57:14,462 --> 00:57:17,829
"All right, you’ll think about it,"
or, "All right, we should do it"?

719
00:57:17,999 --> 00:57:20,229
Is there a difference?

720
00:57:22,436 --> 00:57:27,703
Just tell Gerald to hold on to the chiffonier
and I will be by there after a while.

721
00:57:28,142 --> 00:57:31,976
You know- I gotta call you back. Bye.

722
00:57:33,681 --> 00:57:35,672
Excuse me.

723
00:57:36,884 --> 00:57:38,476
I'm not cutting, I'm just asking.

724
00:57:38,653 --> 00:57:42,316
Let me tell you something. We have been
sitting around here for over an hour...

725
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:46,722
...and when I look around and all I see are
people shooting the bull and drinking coffee.

726
00:57:46,894 --> 00:57:48,088
Who runs this place?

727
00:57:51,365 --> 00:57:53,925
I'd have it in shape in two days,
I can tell you that.

728
00:57:54,101 --> 00:57:57,161
- I bet you would. How can I help you?
- Oh, he was first.

729
00:57:57,338 --> 00:58:00,637
- No, you go ahead. I think I wanna hear this.
- Me too.

730
00:58:00,808 --> 00:58:02,537
I do not appreciate the attitude.

731
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:05,508
Ma'am, now, you can tell me
what you want...

732
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,875
...or I can make sure
you wait here all day.

733
00:58:08,049 --> 00:58:09,539
Now, how can I help you?

734
00:58:09,917 --> 00:58:11,817
I would like to become a legal guardian.

735
00:58:12,086 --> 00:58:14,281
Lord help that child.

736
00:58:17,858 --> 00:58:22,192
There's very little on Michael.
Most of his files have been lost.

737
00:58:22,363 --> 00:58:25,355
- Well, what is in there?
- A few case notes.

738
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:30,360
This one describes an incident where
officers forcibly removed Michael...

739
00:58:30,538 --> 00:58:33,268
...from Denise Oher's care
when Michael was 7.

740
00:58:33,441 --> 00:58:36,239
Quite a scene evidently.
They had to split up the kids.

741
00:58:36,410 --> 00:58:39,937
- And it's far from the worst.
- Where is she? His mother?

742
00:58:40,114 --> 00:58:44,414
I don't know. If you find her, we got
a heap more files we could add to.

743
00:58:45,453 --> 00:58:47,045
Well, how many kids does she have?

744
00:58:47,221 --> 00:58:50,384
Least a dozen, probably. If not more.

745
00:58:50,558 --> 00:58:54,221
With her drug-arrest record, my guess
would be, she can’t even remember.

746
00:58:54,395 --> 00:58:56,090
Can I see that?

747
00:59:00,568 --> 00:59:03,128
So we would need her permission,
right?

748
00:59:03,304 --> 00:59:07,968
No. Michael is a ward of the state.
Just apply and get a judge to sign off on it.

749
00:59:10,745 --> 00:59:14,841
So you would just give him away
without even telling his mother?

750
00:59:29,029 --> 00:59:31,293
Check out this piece right here.

751
00:59:31,465 --> 00:59:33,126
Yeah.
Damn, girl.

752
00:59:38,472 --> 00:59:39,461
<i>Miss Oher?</i>

753
00:59:43,277 --> 00:59:46,303
Hi. Miss- Miss Oher?

754
00:59:48,048 --> 00:59:51,279
- You from the state?
- No.

755
00:59:51,485 --> 00:59:54,511
My name is Leigh Anne Tuohy,
and your son...

756
00:59:54,855 --> 00:59:57,824
...Michael, lives with me...

757
00:59:58,492 --> 01:00:00,585
...and my family.

758
01:00:06,967 --> 01:00:09,993
How is my boy? How's Big Mike?

759
01:00:10,171 --> 01:00:13,265
He's fine. He's doing real well.

760
01:00:14,008 --> 01:00:16,499
We might have some wine in the kitchen,
if you...

761
01:00:16,677 --> 01:00:18,668
Oh, no, no. That's real kind.

762
01:00:19,046 --> 01:00:20,877
When did you last see Michael?

763
01:00:22,449 --> 01:00:24,417
I don't know.

764
01:00:24,585 --> 01:00:28,749
How many-? How many foster kids
you got living with you?

765
01:00:28,923 --> 01:00:33,019
Oh, I'm not a foster parent to Michael.
We're just helping him out.

766
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,918
State don't pay you nothing?

767
01:00:35,229 --> 01:00:37,163
No, no.

768
01:00:37,331 --> 01:00:40,767
And you feed him and
you buy him clothes too?

769
01:00:40,935 --> 01:00:43,904
Well, when we can find them
in his size.

770
01:00:47,107 --> 01:00:49,405
You are a fine Christian lady.

771
01:00:49,777 --> 01:00:52,109
Well, I try to be.

772
01:00:53,414 --> 01:00:55,814
This all real nice, what you're doing...

773
01:00:55,983 --> 01:00:59,441
...but don't be surprised if one day
you wake up and he gone.

774
01:01:00,621 --> 01:01:01,883
What do you mean?

775
01:01:02,056 --> 01:01:06,686
He's a runner. That's what the state
called him after they took him from me.

776
01:01:09,597 --> 01:01:12,259
Every foster home they sent him to...

777
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,831
...he'd slip out the window at night
and come looking for me.

778
01:01:16,003 --> 01:01:21,270
No matter where I was, that boy
would come find me, take care of me.

779
01:01:23,143 --> 01:01:26,806
I've had some health problems.

780
01:01:27,948 --> 01:01:32,044
Miss Oher, was Michael born
under a different name?

781
01:01:32,887 --> 01:01:36,880
Proctor. That was his daddy's last name.

782
01:01:37,391 --> 01:01:38,722
Where is he?

783
01:01:38,893 --> 01:01:42,727
- I ain't seen him since he left.
- And when was that?

784
01:01:42,897 --> 01:01:44,956
Week after Mike was born.

785
01:01:45,933 --> 01:01:47,992
Do you happen to have
his birth certificate?

786
01:01:56,225 --> 01:01:59,558
It's all right. I'll figure it out.

787
01:02:13,842 --> 01:02:16,868
Mrs. Oher, you’ll always be
Michael’s mama.

788
01:02:20,883 --> 01:02:22,316
Would you like to see him?

789
01:02:22,484 --> 01:02:26,386
No. Not this way.

790
01:02:28,657 --> 01:02:30,921
It's Williams.

791
01:02:32,427 --> 01:02:35,089
His last name's Williams.

792
01:02:36,665 --> 01:02:39,964
Couldn’t even remember
who the boy's father is.

793
01:03:08,297 --> 01:03:12,358
I checked out the new Madden. The colors
are better, graphics brighter. It's awesome.

794
01:03:12,534 --> 01:03:15,128
Michael, we have something
we'd like to ask you.

795
01:03:15,804 --> 01:03:20,241
- What?
- Well, Leigh Anne and I, we-

796
01:03:20,509 --> 01:03:24,707
Well, we'd like to become
your legal guardians.

797
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,138
What's that mean?

798
01:03:26,582 --> 01:03:29,574
What it means is,
is that we wanna know...

799
01:03:29,751 --> 01:03:33,050
...if you would like to
become part of this family.

800
01:03:41,863 --> 01:03:43,728
Kind of thought I already was.

801
01:03:52,574 --> 01:03:55,168
Well, all right, then.

802
01:04:02,851 --> 01:04:04,614
Right here.

803
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:11,386
You got a couple steps.
Better watch that big foot.

804
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,788
One more.

805
01:04:12,961 --> 01:04:15,259
One more. There you go.

806
01:04:16,331 --> 01:04:18,731
All right. Take off the blindfold.

807
01:04:22,904 --> 01:04:27,398
Well? That's the one you wanted,
isn't it? Heh.

808
01:04:27,576 --> 01:04:31,012
Here. Here you go, go ahead.
Take it for a ride. Go on.

809
01:04:31,179 --> 01:04:34,148
Can I go too?
- Yeah, but, Michael? Be careful.

810
01:04:34,316 --> 01:04:36,307
Shotgun!

811
01:04:36,485 --> 01:04:37,952
Whoo-hoo!

812
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:42,682
- He wanted a truck?
- Well, Michael thinks he's a redneck.

813
01:04:42,858 --> 01:04:44,792
Come on, Michael!

814
01:04:45,394 --> 01:04:49,194
Okay. See, you're the ketchup,
here at left tackle on the weak side.

815
01:04:49,364 --> 01:04:52,299
The first play is simple. Gap.

816
01:04:54,336 --> 01:04:58,329
Now, see, this just means that you're
going to block whoever's in front of you...

817
01:04:58,507 --> 01:05:01,704
...or on your inside shoulder, if
you're not covered by a defender.

818
01:05:01,877 --> 01:05:05,369
Now, I'll be the running back, and you
show me what you're supposed to do.

819
01:05:05,714 --> 01:05:07,113
Ready? Hike!

820
01:05:07,616 --> 01:05:11,484
You'll block him. He'll hit him.
Quarterback'll hand it off.

821
01:05:11,653 --> 01:05:13,518
He gets the ball, and he takes off!

822
01:05:13,689 --> 01:05:16,283
Open lane to the end zone.
All there is to it.

823
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:17,720
What's going on here?

824
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,221
Blended spice just scored.

825
01:05:20,395 --> 01:05:23,387
We were going through the playbook.
Michael got moved to offense.

826
01:05:23,565 --> 01:05:26,898
When you're done, put the players
back in the spice cabinet. Thank you.

827
01:05:27,069 --> 01:05:28,536
No problem.

828
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:32,601
Actually, Mom, we were
kind of waiting for you.

829
01:05:32,774 --> 01:05:34,708
You see,
the new Madden game came out...

830
01:05:34,876 --> 01:05:37,174
...and me and Michael
were wanting to go get it.

831
01:05:37,345 --> 01:05:40,974
- I can’t, I've got a meeting in 10 minutes.
- But he can drive.

832
01:05:41,216 --> 01:05:42,979
He can drive us.

833
01:05:45,787 --> 01:05:47,482
Oh, yeah, that’s what I'm talking about.

834
01:05:47,656 --> 01:05:50,124
What you know about this?
I know a lot about this.

835
01:05:50,292 --> 01:05:52,385
- Show me something then.
- I'll show you something.

836
01:05:52,561 --> 01:05:54,620
- I'll start it. Follow my lead.
- All right.

837
01:05:54,796 --> 01:05:55,922
- You ready?
- Yeah.

838
01:05:56,098 --> 01:05:57,156
<i>Next day's function</i>

839
01:05:57,332 --> 01:05:58,697
<i>High-class luncheon</i>

840
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:00,357
<i>- Food is served
- And you're stone-cold munchin'</i>

841
01:06:00,535 --> 01:06:02,366
<i>- Music comes on
- People start to dance</i>

842
01:06:02,537 --> 01:06:04,528
<i>- But then you ate so much
- You nearly split your pants</i>

843
01:06:04,706 --> 01:06:06,537
<i>- A girl starts walkin'
- Guy starts gawkin'</i>

844
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:08,300
<i>- Sits down next to you
- Starts talkin'</i>

845
01:06:08,477 --> 01:06:10,741
<i>- Says she wanna dance
- 'Cause she likes the groove</i>

846
01:06:10,912 --> 01:06:13,107
<i>- So come on, fatso
- And just bust a move</i>

847
01:06:13,281 --> 01:06:17,217
<i>If you want it
You got it</i>

848
01:06:17,385 --> 01:06:21,185
<i>You want it
Baby, you got it</i>

849
01:06:21,356 --> 01:06:25,349
<i>You want it
You got it</i>

850
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:29,054
<i>You want it
Baby, you got it</i>

851
01:06:33,034 --> 01:06:34,899
This is not a $40,000 Oushak, Omid.

852
01:06:36,271 --> 01:06:37,363
You're crazy, Leigh Anne.

853
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:40,770
The borders are different widths.
They've been altered.

854
01:06:40,942 --> 01:06:44,776
We'll give you 17, tops, all right? Hello.

855
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:50,681
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ma'am, you can’t get through.

856
01:06:50,852 --> 01:06:53,252
Those are my kids. Those are my kids.

857
01:06:55,724 --> 01:06:57,988
- Oh, my God.
Please, God, let him be okay.

858
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,185
Where are they?!
I'm so sorry!

859
01:07:00,362 --> 01:07:04,458
- Michael, are you okay?
- I'm fine! SJ! Go help SJ!

860
01:07:05,133 --> 01:07:07,658
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

861
01:07:08,136 --> 01:07:09,797
How are his vitals?

862
01:07:09,971 --> 01:07:11,529
Excuse me, ma'am.
- That's my son.

863
01:07:11,706 --> 01:07:13,970
SJ. SJ, baby.

864
01:07:14,142 --> 01:07:15,769
- Mama?
- Yes, baby?

865
01:07:15,944 --> 01:07:18,310
Do you think the blood'll
come out of my shirt?

866
01:07:19,815 --> 01:07:23,148
Yes, I think the blood
will come out of your shirt.

867
01:07:23,318 --> 01:07:25,081
An air bag deploys at 200 miles an hour.

868
01:07:25,253 --> 01:07:27,380
Your son is too small
to be in the front seat.

869
01:07:27,556 --> 01:07:29,148
But he is okay, right?

870
01:07:29,324 --> 01:07:33,124
Busted lip, bruised face. Usually when
someone his size gets hit with a air bag...

871
01:07:33,295 --> 01:07:35,820
...it's a fractured face, broken neck,
maybe worse.

872
01:07:35,997 --> 01:07:39,797
It's like the air bag was coming for him
and changed direction.

873
01:07:39,968 --> 01:07:42,129
It's probably defective or something...

874
01:07:42,304 --> 01:07:44,636
...but your son's very, very lucky.

875
01:07:44,806 --> 01:07:48,173
No, I did. I called the insurance,
it's fine. It's fine.

876
01:07:48,343 --> 01:07:50,277
I'll talk to you later. I gotta go. Bye.

877
01:07:54,115 --> 01:07:56,276
SJ's fine.

878
01:07:57,118 --> 01:08:01,851
He is. He's actually enjoying all
the attention he's getting back there.

879
01:08:03,091 --> 01:08:07,255
Hey, Michael, could’ve happened to
anyone, all right? It's not your fault.

880
01:08:08,263 --> 01:08:10,197
Honey, look at me.

881
01:08:16,037 --> 01:08:17,971
Michael, what happened to your arm?

882
01:08:19,608 --> 01:08:21,508
I stopped it.

883
01:08:29,684 --> 01:08:30,708
Wide right!
Ready.

884
01:08:30,886 --> 01:08:34,822
Let's go.
We're going right, right, right!

885
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:41,425
- Roll three, roll three.
Ready, set, go!

886
01:08:47,002 --> 01:08:51,837
Oher! You got 100 pounds on Collis and
you can’t keep him out of our backfield?

887
01:08:52,007 --> 01:08:54,669
Hold your block until
the whistle blows. Hold it!

888
01:08:54,843 --> 01:08:56,674
All right, let's go!

889
01:08:57,345 --> 01:08:59,006
What's with the camera?

890
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:02,638
Michael always does better when
he sees what he's supposed to be doing.

891
01:09:03,618 --> 01:09:05,552
Set, go!

892
01:09:08,857 --> 01:09:12,452
- Holding. Left tackle.
Michael! Come on.

893
01:09:12,694 --> 01:09:14,389
Oher.

894
01:09:14,963 --> 01:09:16,396
Come here, son.

895
01:09:16,798 --> 01:09:21,132
If you're gonna hold him, hold him
inside here, between the tits. You got it?

896
01:09:21,303 --> 01:09:22,736
Will you look at me, son?

897
01:09:22,904 --> 01:09:26,897
If you grab him outside here like this or
with that horse-collar thing you just did...

898
01:09:27,075 --> 01:09:29,976
...you're gonna get flagged and
I'm gonna be pissed, you hear?

899
01:09:30,145 --> 01:09:31,874
All right, let's go!

900
01:09:32,981 --> 01:09:34,972
Baby, watch my stuff, all right?

901
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:37,714
Okay.

902
01:09:38,954 --> 01:09:41,718
Well, at least he'll look good
coming off the bus.

903
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:45,451
They'll be terrified till they realize
he's a marshmallow.

904
01:09:47,696 --> 01:09:50,859
Looks like Tarzan, plays like Jane.

905
01:09:52,133 --> 01:09:53,225
Give me a minute, Bert.

906
01:09:54,602 --> 01:09:58,163
- We're in the middle of a practice.
- You can thank me later.

907
01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,230
Come here.

908
01:10:00,408 --> 01:10:04,435
Michael. Remember when we first met
and we went to that horrible part of town...

909
01:10:04,612 --> 01:10:06,341
...to buy you those dreadful clothes?

910
01:10:06,514 --> 01:10:09,506
I was a little scared. You told me
not to worry, you had my back.

911
01:10:09,684 --> 01:10:11,151
- You remember that?
- Yes, ma'am.

912
01:10:11,319 --> 01:10:15,346
And if anyone tried to get to me,
you would’ve stopped them, right?

913
01:10:15,523 --> 01:10:20,119
And when you and SJ were in that car
wreck, what did you do to the air bag?

914
01:10:20,295 --> 01:10:24,493
- Stopped it.
- You stopped it. You stopped it.

915
01:10:24,666 --> 01:10:29,626
This team is your family, Michael. You have
to protect them from those guys, okay?

916
01:10:29,804 --> 01:10:30,793
Listen.

917
01:10:32,574 --> 01:10:37,102
Okay. Tony here is your quarterback,
all right? You protect his blind side.

918
01:10:37,278 --> 01:10:40,179
When you look at him, you think of me,
how you have my back...

919
01:10:40,348 --> 01:10:42,646
...how you have his. Okay?

920
01:10:42,817 --> 01:10:44,808
All right, Tony, go back.

921
01:10:46,087 --> 01:10:47,679
All right.

922
01:10:47,956 --> 01:10:51,289
Oompa-Loompa here is your tailback.
When you look at him, think of SJ...

923
01:10:51,459 --> 01:10:54,951
...and how you'd never let anyone or
anything hurt him. You understand me?

924
01:10:55,397 --> 01:10:57,661
All right. Go back.

925
01:10:57,899 --> 01:11:00,527
- Got it?
- What about Collins and Mr. Tuohy?

926
01:11:00,702 --> 01:11:04,729
Fine, they can be on the team too.
Are you gonna protect the family, Michael?

927
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,499
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good boy.

928
01:11:07,675 --> 01:11:09,472
Now go have some fun.

929
01:11:14,849 --> 01:11:18,012
Yelling at him doesn't work, Bert.
He doesn't trust men.

930
01:11:18,186 --> 01:11:22,179
In his experience, they pretend
to care about you till they disappear.

931
01:11:28,797 --> 01:11:30,025
Wanna run a play?

932
01:11:33,301 --> 01:11:35,326
SJ, you're gonna wanna get this.

933
01:11:35,703 --> 01:11:37,500
Okay.

934
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,974
Come on, Michael.

935
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:47,541
Ready!

936
01:11:47,715 --> 01:11:48,943
Set, go!

937
01:11:54,522 --> 01:11:57,116
- Yeah.
- All right, Michael, come on.

938
01:12:01,362 --> 01:12:02,886
Set, go!

939
01:12:06,401 --> 01:12:09,893
- Whoo! Yes! Michael!
All right, way to go, O, way to go!

940
01:12:13,041 --> 01:12:15,976
Ready! Set, go!

941
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:20,804
Yes!

942
01:12:24,052 --> 01:12:25,246
That a boy.

943
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:28,617
You all right?
Hey, get over here. Let's go.

944
01:12:34,095 --> 01:12:36,063
Come on, son!

945
01:12:36,364 --> 01:12:39,891
Okay. What'd you say to him?

946
01:12:40,068 --> 01:12:42,195
You should get to know your players,
Bert.

947
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:46,272
He tested 98 percent
in protective instincts.

948
01:12:48,576 --> 01:12:50,510
I said you could thank me later.

949
01:12:51,846 --> 01:12:53,973
It's later, Bert.

950
01:12:58,553 --> 01:13:01,579
<i>Milford! Milford! Milford!</i>

951
01:13:05,627 --> 01:13:07,993
So much for home-field advantage.

952
01:13:08,163 --> 01:13:10,654
You ever see so many rednecks
in one place?

953
01:13:10,832 --> 01:13:13,392
NASCAR. Not even close.

954
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:18,933
Crusaders! Get ready for 48 minutes
of hell!

955
01:13:19,107 --> 01:13:20,597
Look at that fat ass.

956
01:13:22,911 --> 01:13:24,208
Pay them back on the field.

957
01:13:24,379 --> 01:13:26,472
Coming through. Hold on.
Listen up! Listen up!

958
01:13:26,648 --> 01:13:30,175
Don't let them get inside your head now.
Keep your composure! You ready?

959
01:13:30,351 --> 01:13:32,785
Yeah!
- All right, let's go, Crusaders!

960
01:13:34,722 --> 01:13:36,883
Go, Wingate!
- Let's go, Crusaders!

961
01:13:37,058 --> 01:13:38,582
Michael!

962
01:13:39,527 --> 01:13:42,985
Damn, that ain't fair. They got
a big old black bear playing for them.

963
01:13:43,398 --> 01:13:46,162
- What is this, a circus?
- Right.

964
01:13:46,467 --> 01:13:50,870
Eyes forward, SJ. Sticks and stones.
Sticks and stones. Come on!

965
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:06,186
Go!

966
01:14:10,525 --> 01:14:13,358
- All right, all right. Good start.
- Nice.

967
01:14:15,129 --> 01:14:16,721
Ready.
Break!

968
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,693
- Let's go, O! Let's go!
Whoo!

969
01:14:21,236 --> 01:14:24,399
Hey, you guys, look at this big buck
we got right here! Whoo!

970
01:14:24,739 --> 01:14:27,264
Coming after you! Coming after you!

971
01:14:27,609 --> 01:14:29,839
You're all mine. All mine.

972
01:14:30,011 --> 01:14:32,775
Ready, set, go!

973
01:14:37,785 --> 01:14:39,082
Yeah!

974
01:14:39,254 --> 01:14:41,654
Don't let him rip through, Oher!
Come on, son.

975
01:14:41,856 --> 01:14:44,051
Yeah! That's right, boy!

976
01:14:44,225 --> 01:14:47,160
- All night long, fat ass! All night long!
Good job.

977
01:14:47,328 --> 01:14:51,788
I got you, boy! All night long.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

978
01:14:51,966 --> 01:14:53,126
Now that’s my boy.

979
01:14:53,568 --> 01:14:54,660
It's all right, Michael.

980
01:14:54,836 --> 01:14:56,531
- It's all right. Come on.
- Let's go.

981
01:14:56,704 --> 01:14:58,262
Shake it off. Come on.

982
01:15:01,175 --> 01:15:04,941
Here we go. Round two, baby, round two.

983
01:15:07,115 --> 01:15:08,673
Ready!

984
01:15:09,117 --> 01:15:10,607
- Set!
- Switch! Switch!

985
01:15:10,785 --> 01:15:13,481
Got it! Got it!
Go!

986
01:15:17,258 --> 01:15:19,988
Whoo! Yeah!

987
01:15:20,561 --> 01:15:24,429
Oher, don't let him get the inside gap
on you. Come on. Use your head!

988
01:15:24,599 --> 01:15:27,966
- What is Bert doing? Nothing.
Break!

989
01:15:28,469 --> 01:15:30,403
Break!
- Hey, fat boy.

990
01:15:30,571 --> 01:15:34,302
We're not done yet. All game long,
boy. All game long!

991
01:15:34,475 --> 01:15:35,772
Slot right, slot right.

992
01:15:36,244 --> 01:15:38,235
Ready, set, go!

993
01:15:40,181 --> 01:15:41,910
Pass, pass, pass!

994
01:15:43,284 --> 01:15:44,808
Stop this- Oh!

995
01:15:44,986 --> 01:15:46,044
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

996
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:47,744
Yeah.

997
01:15:48,523 --> 01:15:50,150
Why another pass, Bert?

998
01:15:50,325 --> 01:15:52,259
Hey, where you going, fat boy?

999
01:15:52,427 --> 01:15:56,796
You better stay off my field. You are
not welcome here! This is my field!

1000
01:15:56,964 --> 01:16:00,991
- Sixty-six, get back to your own bench!
- Bert! Be quiet. Bert!

1001
01:16:10,278 --> 01:16:11,302
Hello?

1002
01:16:11,479 --> 01:16:15,142
Enough with the trick plays, Bert.
Run the dang ball.

1003
01:16:16,884 --> 01:16:19,318
You heard me. Run the dang ball. Run it!

1004
01:16:21,222 --> 01:16:23,019
Wait, did he just hang up the phone?

1005
01:16:23,191 --> 01:16:25,853
- No, I think he lost service.
- He did not lose service.

1006
01:16:26,027 --> 01:16:28,655
- Whoo!
Oh, that’s my boy, Jimmy!

1007
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:32,391
Number 66! Kicking that blue gum's ass.

1008
01:16:34,402 --> 01:16:36,700
Hey. Crotch-mouth.

1009
01:16:36,871 --> 01:16:40,534
Yeah, you. Zip it or I'll come
up there and zip it for you.

1010
01:16:43,845 --> 01:16:45,039
Sticks and stones?

1011
01:16:45,213 --> 01:16:47,408
You know what, SJ, just turn forward.

1012
01:16:47,582 --> 01:16:51,143
Just pick up the camera and
keep shooting. Come on.

1013
01:16:51,919 --> 01:16:53,386
Push it, push it, push it!

1014
01:16:54,389 --> 01:16:56,050
And go!

1015
01:16:59,894 --> 01:17:01,327
Squeeze in!

1016
01:17:05,333 --> 01:17:06,391
Hah.

1017
01:17:06,567 --> 01:17:09,001
It's all right. All right, all right,
we can come back from that.

1018
01:17:11,105 --> 01:17:13,164
Set, go!

1019
01:17:26,287 --> 01:17:27,311
Break!

1020
01:17:27,488 --> 01:17:29,217
And go!

1021
01:17:33,227 --> 01:17:34,524
Come on!

1022
01:17:34,695 --> 01:17:36,663
Get him!
- He's gone. He's gone.

1023
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:44,431
- He's gotta shut that hole off.
- No.

1024
01:17:46,741 --> 01:17:51,610
Unbelievable. Three plays. Three
plays. What were we in, 4-3? Come on!

1025
01:17:53,314 --> 01:17:55,145
Ready.
Break!

1026
01:17:55,316 --> 01:17:58,285
Whoo! That's right, biggie, me and you.

1027
01:17:58,453 --> 01:18:01,718
Me and you, biggie, one more time.
Here we go.

1028
01:18:03,324 --> 01:18:04,951
Ready!

1029
01:18:06,027 --> 01:18:07,517
Set! Go!

1030
01:18:16,471 --> 01:18:20,305
All right, Bobby, cut back. Son,
you gotta cut back, you gotta cut back.

1031
01:18:20,475 --> 01:18:23,535
- Come on. Let's go. Back to huddle.
- You fat, black piece of crap.

1032
01:18:23,711 --> 01:18:27,511
Hey! Hey! Ref, are you gonna
do something about this?

1033
01:18:27,682 --> 01:18:30,674
He just kicked my boy in the head
and he cussed him!

1034
01:18:30,852 --> 01:18:32,683
Thank you.

1035
01:18:32,854 --> 01:18:35,846
Unsportsmanlike conduct, Wingate.
Fifteen yards.

1036
01:18:36,023 --> 01:18:38,150
- What?
- You shut up, you get another 15.

1037
01:18:42,330 --> 01:18:45,788
This young man plays for my team.
My team!

1038
01:18:45,967 --> 01:18:50,028
And I will defend him
like he's my own son against you...

1039
01:18:50,204 --> 01:18:54,265
...or any other redneck son of a bitch!

1040
01:18:54,909 --> 01:18:57,707
Don't worry, coach. I got your back.

1041
01:19:07,388 --> 01:19:09,083
Come here, son, come here.

1042
01:19:09,924 --> 01:19:12,051
- Try Gap.
- Gap?

1043
01:19:12,226 --> 01:19:13,250
Gap.

1044
01:19:14,061 --> 01:19:17,656
All right. Gun rip, 47 Gap.
On one, on one. Ready.

1045
01:19:17,832 --> 01:19:19,356
Break!

1046
01:19:24,171 --> 01:19:27,004
Your coach ain't here
to protect you now, is he?

1047
01:19:34,048 --> 01:19:36,107
Ready!

1048
01:19:36,951 --> 01:19:38,714
<i>This team is your family, Michael.</i>

1049
01:19:38,886 --> 01:19:40,444
Set!

1050
01:19:45,126 --> 01:19:46,150
Go!

1051
01:19:52,266 --> 01:19:54,257
Cut back, cut back. Block him, Oher.

1052
01:19:54,669 --> 01:19:56,227
He's got a hole! He's got a hole!

1053
01:20:00,675 --> 01:20:02,540
- Get him, Michael.
- SJ!

1054
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:05,178
Get him, Michael. Come on, go!
Run, Michael!

1055
01:20:07,682 --> 01:20:09,047
Go, go, go!

1056
01:20:09,216 --> 01:20:11,047
- Go, Mike!
- Go, Michael!

1057
01:20:11,218 --> 01:20:12,617
Yeah, touchdown!

1058
01:20:12,787 --> 01:20:14,755
Hey! Hey! Touchdown!

1059
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:18,190
Ooh.

1060
01:20:22,229 --> 01:20:24,197
<i>Yo! Deliverance!</i>

1061
01:20:24,365 --> 01:20:27,801
You see number 74?
Well, that’s my son.

1062
01:20:29,704 --> 01:20:31,194
Way to go, bro! Ha-ha-ha.

1063
01:20:31,372 --> 01:20:33,237
Okay, here's what we got.
Dead ball foul.

1064
01:20:33,407 --> 01:20:36,035
- Now what? Was he holding?
- No.

1065
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:39,873
- Did he hit after the whistle?
- I don't believe so.

1066
01:20:40,047 --> 01:20:42,015
Then what was the flag for?

1067
01:20:42,183 --> 01:20:45,641
I don't know. Excessive blocking.

1068
01:20:45,987 --> 01:20:47,011
You're kidding me.

1069
01:20:50,925 --> 01:20:54,019
Sorry, coach. I stopped
when I heard the whistle.

1070
01:20:54,195 --> 01:20:55,685
Where were you taking him, Mike?

1071
01:20:55,863 --> 01:20:59,560
To the bus. It was time for him
to go home.

1072
01:21:01,569 --> 01:21:03,662
Attaboy, Michael Oher. Attaboy!

1073
01:21:03,838 --> 01:21:06,466
Go get them! Go get them, Crusaders!

1074
01:21:08,876 --> 01:21:11,902
Ready, set, go!

1075
01:21:23,824 --> 01:21:25,951
Ready, set, go!

1076
01:21:35,436 --> 01:21:37,267
- Whoo!
- Whoo! Michael!

1077
01:21:39,607 --> 01:21:41,199
Set, go!

1078
01:21:48,649 --> 01:21:50,173
Yeah!

1079
01:21:53,788 --> 01:21:57,849
Hey! Hey! Rub the head, rub the head.
All right, let's go!

1080
01:21:58,359 --> 01:22:00,884
- Oh.
- Tackle, over there.

1081
01:22:01,662 --> 01:22:03,892
Ready, set, go!

1082
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:07,299
Stay.

1083
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:29,580
Ready, 21! Ready, 21!

1084
01:22:29,924 --> 01:22:31,653
Set!

1085
01:22:31,892 --> 01:22:33,450
Pull it!

1086
01:22:53,914 --> 01:22:56,314
Tom Lemming Recruiting, please hold.

1087
01:22:56,484 --> 01:22:58,543
Tom Lemming Recruiting, please hold.

1088
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:02,086
Coach Saban wants his monthly
recruiting updates FedExed.

1089
01:23:02,256 --> 01:23:06,750
Does he really think getting it one day
early is gonna give LSU a leg up?

1090
01:23:07,161 --> 01:23:09,959
Hey, have you filled all the slots
in the Army all-star game?

1091
01:23:10,131 --> 01:23:11,428
Yeah, why?

1092
01:23:11,599 --> 01:23:13,123
You might wanna open one up.

1093
01:23:30,117 --> 01:23:31,675
Oh.

1094
01:23:35,589 --> 01:23:36,613
Wow.

1095
01:23:51,872 --> 01:23:53,999
What did I tell you?

1096
01:24:02,817 --> 01:24:05,251
I want him. I want him bad.

1097
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:10,653
<i>Y- E-L-L, everybody yell.
Say, everybody yell.</i>

1098
01:24:10,825 --> 01:24:14,693
<i>Y- E-L-L, everybody yell</i>

1099
01:24:14,862 --> 01:24:17,524
Nice kick this time, Collins. Nice job.

1100
01:24:17,698 --> 01:24:19,563
What in the world?

1101
01:24:19,867 --> 01:24:23,303
All right, y’all keep practicing.
Remember, point your toes.

1102
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:28,464
<i>One, two, three, one! One, two,
three, two! One, two, three, three!</i>

1103
01:24:28,642 --> 01:24:30,803
You gonna buckle up today, son?

1104
01:24:33,113 --> 01:24:36,480
Shoot, man, Fulmer's here.
Might as well go home.

1105
01:24:36,650 --> 01:24:39,778
What do you say, fellas? Doing
all right? Good to see everybody.

1106
01:24:39,954 --> 01:24:42,218
Came all the way from Knoxville
to see for myself.

1107
01:24:42,389 --> 01:24:45,517
Heck, coach, we drove from Clemson,
nine hours.

1108
01:24:45,693 --> 01:24:47,285
Coach Fulmer. It's a real honor.

1109
01:24:47,461 --> 01:24:50,396
My pleasure. I've watched your program.
You've done really well.

1110
01:24:50,564 --> 01:24:53,692
I don't think there's any question
you’ll be at the next level soon.

1111
01:24:53,868 --> 01:24:56,701
Oh, well, you know, we do
what we can with what we've got.

1112
01:24:57,571 --> 01:25:00,165
Is that-? Is that Michael? Is that O'Hare?

1113
01:25:00,341 --> 01:25:04,607
It's Oher. Like a paddle in a boat. Oher.

1114
01:25:08,249 --> 01:25:11,150
You think we might see some drills,
perhaps?

1115
01:25:11,318 --> 01:25:15,379
- I think all the coaches would appreciate it.
- Oh, yes, sir. You bet.

1116
01:25:17,625 --> 01:25:19,490
Listen up, fellas!
We're gonna do a board drill.

1117
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:22,151
Big Mike,
Jay Collis, best on best right here.

1118
01:25:22,329 --> 01:25:24,024
Let's go, come on, come on!

1119
01:25:32,172 --> 01:25:33,264
On the whistle, men.

1120
01:25:53,727 --> 01:25:54,751
Wow.

1121
01:26:01,802 --> 01:26:02,826
Coach. Thank you.

1122
01:26:03,003 --> 01:26:05,904
- Where are you off to, coach?
- Back to South Carolina.

1123
01:26:06,073 --> 01:26:10,134
You tell Michael Oher, if he can qualify
with the grades, Clemson wants him.

1124
01:26:10,311 --> 01:26:12,541
Yeah, good luck with that, Brad.

1125
01:26:12,713 --> 01:26:14,772
You've done a great job
with this young man.

1126
01:26:14,949 --> 01:26:17,144
He was a little raw
when we first got him...

1127
01:26:17,318 --> 01:26:19,752
...but we've, you know,
coached him up a little bit.

1128
01:26:22,856 --> 01:26:24,915
Where is that?

1129
01:26:25,092 --> 01:26:28,459
Well, make me guess.

1130
01:26:30,364 --> 01:26:31,388
Hello, Mama.

1131
01:26:31,565 --> 01:26:34,363
Did you know to be eligible
for a Division I scholarship...

1132
01:26:34,535 --> 01:26:38,631
- ...Michael will need to make a 2.5 GPA?
- Really?

1133
01:26:38,806 --> 01:26:43,334
His ACT is low and I don't see it getting
any better if he retakes it. Right there.

1134
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:44,772
Well, what's his GPA now?

1135
01:26:44,945 --> 01:26:47,470
1.76.

1136
01:26:47,648 --> 01:26:49,912
That's not bad when you
consider where he started.

1137
01:26:50,084 --> 01:26:52,450
Well, he's gonna have to
make all A's this year.

1138
01:26:52,953 --> 01:26:56,548
I'm serious.
And that might not even be enough.

1139
01:26:56,724 --> 01:26:58,316
So he goes to a junior college.

1140
01:26:59,026 --> 01:27:01,927
Unh-uhn. Most inner-city kids that
go to JC drop out in the first year.

1141
01:27:02,096 --> 01:27:04,360
And his shot at the pros
would go out the window.

1142
01:27:04,531 --> 01:27:07,591
Pros? Are we even sure
he's gonna get college offers?

1143
01:27:10,771 --> 01:27:13,262
<i>Michael, Nick Saban from LSU.</i>

1144
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,806
<i>Looking forward to you
coming down and visiting.</i>

1145
01:27:15,976 --> 01:27:18,945
<i>Greetings, I'm Lou Holtz
from South Carolina. I'm call-</i>

1146
01:27:19,113 --> 01:27:22,605
<i>We are very interested in having
Michael over to Knoxville for a visit.</i>

1147
01:27:23,851 --> 01:27:25,079
Phil Fulmer, Tennessee.

1148
01:27:25,252 --> 01:27:29,655
There's 20 more of them on there.
And these things right here, 50 of them.

1149
01:27:29,823 --> 01:27:31,290
- Any of those from Ole Miss?
- No.

1150
01:27:31,458 --> 01:27:34,393
They're not gonna start recruiting
till they hire another coach.

1151
01:27:34,561 --> 01:27:38,292
Doesn't make any difference
unless Michael makes his grades. Ahem.

1152
01:27:39,666 --> 01:27:40,690
What are we gonna do?

1153
01:27:42,844 --> 01:27:45,938
I understand you applied
for a teaching position at Wingate.

1154
01:27:47,181 --> 01:27:48,978
I wasn't religious enough for them.

1155
01:27:49,617 --> 01:27:55,180
I'm a spiritual person, Mrs. Tuohy,
but I have certain, shall we say, doubts.

1156
01:27:56,257 --> 01:27:58,282
Well, I appreciate your honesty,
Miss Sue.

1157
01:27:58,659 --> 01:28:00,251
What's the situation with Michael?

1158
01:28:00,428 --> 01:28:02,896
- He needs to do better in school.
- Obviously.

1159
01:28:03,064 --> 01:28:04,326
But why the big push?

1160
01:28:04,498 --> 01:28:08,559
Well, he's in line for a football
scholarship if he gets his grades up.

1161
01:28:08,736 --> 01:28:11,899
- Is he considering Ole Miss?
- Better be.

1162
01:28:13,307 --> 01:28:14,865
I'd love to work with him.

1163
01:28:15,042 --> 01:28:17,442
Well, when would you like to start?

1164
01:28:18,312 --> 01:28:22,180
Mrs. Tuohy, um, there's something
you should know about me.

1165
01:28:22,350 --> 01:28:24,045
I don't usually tell many people...

1166
01:28:24,218 --> 01:28:27,881
...but it's something I feel you should
be aware of before you hire me.

1167
01:28:28,556 --> 01:28:30,615
Uh- What is it?

1168
01:28:31,525 --> 01:28:33,049
I'm a Democrat.

1169
01:28:35,196 --> 01:28:36,959
Okay.

1170
01:28:42,236 --> 01:28:44,761
- I don't understand it.
- Yet.

1171
01:28:44,939 --> 01:28:47,203
You don't understand it yet.

1172
01:28:49,010 --> 01:28:50,500
How big is your head, Michael?

1173
01:28:50,745 --> 01:28:52,076
Big.

1174
01:28:52,246 --> 01:28:53,679
And what's in there?

1175
01:28:53,848 --> 01:28:55,145
- A brain.
- A brain.

1176
01:28:55,316 --> 01:28:57,011
It's full of knowledge.

1177
01:28:57,184 --> 01:29:01,814
Like a file cabinet with maps,
and shortcuts for figuring things out.

1178
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:06,324
You'll get there, Michael Oher, because
I'm here to help you use those maps...

1179
01:29:06,494 --> 01:29:10,521
...and reach your destination,
like Sacagawea led Lewis and Clark.

1180
01:29:10,698 --> 01:29:11,926
Sacagawea?

1181
01:29:12,099 --> 01:29:15,466
We'll get to that.
And the history books have it wrong.

1182
01:29:15,636 --> 01:29:18,833
All you need to know
is I'll get you there.

1183
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,631
Do you believe me?

1184
01:29:24,412 --> 01:29:26,039
You trust me, Michael?

1185
01:29:28,282 --> 01:29:29,306
Yes, Miss Sue.

1186
01:29:32,153 --> 01:29:33,347
Try it again.

1187
01:29:34,889 --> 01:29:37,722
What's the next one? Read that
to me. Okay, what does it say?

1188
01:29:37,892 --> 01:29:42,329
First we have to find the constant.
Now, where is the constant?

1189
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:45,091
Good. See?

1190
01:29:45,266 --> 01:29:48,463
Who'd have thought we'd have
a black son before we knew a Democrat?

1191
01:29:50,638 --> 01:29:53,835
Doorbell!
I got it, guys.

1192
01:29:56,444 --> 01:29:58,503
Coach, how are you? Come in.
Sean Tuohy.

1193
01:29:58,679 --> 01:30:01,477
- Nick Saban, nice to meet you.
- Nice to see you. My pleasure.

1194
01:30:01,649 --> 01:30:03,913
I appreciate the opportunity
to come in your home.

1195
01:30:04,085 --> 01:30:06,519
- This is my daughter, Collins.
- Pleasure to meet you.

1196
01:30:06,687 --> 01:30:09,554
- And you must be Leigh Anne.
- That would be me, Coach Saban.

1197
01:30:09,724 --> 01:30:11,157
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

1198
01:30:11,325 --> 01:30:13,816
Just call me Nick.
This is an incredible home.

1199
01:30:13,995 --> 01:30:16,225
The Windsor valances are a nice touch.

1200
01:30:16,397 --> 01:30:20,390
Well, thank you.
You obviously have excellent taste.

1201
01:30:20,568 --> 01:30:22,502
Well, we appreciate quality...

1202
01:30:22,670 --> 01:30:24,535
...and recognize it when we see it.

1203
01:30:26,107 --> 01:30:28,507
Michael, why don't you come in
and say hello?

1204
01:30:28,676 --> 01:30:31,008
- Nick Saban. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1205
01:30:31,178 --> 01:30:33,271
And you must be SJ.
- That's me.

1206
01:30:33,447 --> 01:30:36,848
Michael, why don't you and Nick
go into the living room and talk?

1207
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,310
Can SJ come?

1208
01:30:38,486 --> 01:30:41,512
- Absolutely. We'll recruit the both of you.
- All right.

1209
01:30:44,525 --> 01:30:46,686
I find him extremely handsome.

1210
01:30:46,861 --> 01:30:48,761
Yeah, I'm right here, Leigh Anne.

1211
01:30:48,929 --> 01:30:50,453
Yeah, I know.

1212
01:30:50,631 --> 01:30:53,623
So, Michael, we would love
to get you down to LSU for a visit.

1213
01:30:53,801 --> 01:30:55,769
We've got a great thing going
right now.

1214
01:30:55,936 --> 01:30:59,394
You have an opportunity to be
successful as a person, as a student...

1215
01:30:59,573 --> 01:31:03,805
...and an opportunity to be a part of the
next national championship team at LSU.

1216
01:31:03,978 --> 01:31:07,004
So, what do you say?
Would you like to commit to a visit?

1217
01:31:07,181 --> 01:31:08,614
Can I ask a question?
Sure.

1218
01:31:08,949 --> 01:31:12,476
My brother and I are very close,
and so...

1219
01:31:12,653 --> 01:31:17,488
...I'm very afraid that if he goes off
to school, I might not get to see him.

1220
01:31:17,658 --> 01:31:19,319
- So...
- Go on.

1221
01:31:19,493 --> 01:31:23,293
I guess I was just wondering
how much access I'd have to him.

1222
01:31:23,464 --> 01:31:25,898
Well, SJ, you would have
total access to Michael.

1223
01:31:26,067 --> 01:31:29,161
But better than that, in his first game
in Tiger Stadium...

1224
01:31:29,336 --> 01:31:32,100
...we would like for you to lead
the team out of the tunnel.

1225
01:31:32,273 --> 01:31:34,673
- What do you think about that?
- Sounds good.

1226
01:31:49,156 --> 01:31:50,350
Come on in.

1227
01:31:50,524 --> 01:31:53,721
Greetings. I'm Lou Holtz from
the University of South Carolina.

1228
01:31:53,894 --> 01:31:56,863
Leigh Anne Tuohy. Nice to meet you.
Come on in. Michael?

1229
01:31:57,031 --> 01:31:59,158
Hello. I'm Tommy Tuberville,
Auburn University.

1230
01:31:59,333 --> 01:32:01,528
Leigh Anne Tuohy. Nice to meet you.
Michael?

1231
01:32:01,702 --> 01:32:05,160
- Houston Nutt, University of Arkansas.
- Leigh Anne Tuohy. Nice to meet you.

1232
01:32:05,339 --> 01:32:07,864
- Ole Miss cup, huh?
- Michael?

1233
01:32:10,044 --> 01:32:12,308
Oh, come on. You know this.

1234
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,209
It's logical.

1235
01:32:25,459 --> 01:32:28,019
I guarantee, you come to
University of South Carolina...

1236
01:32:28,195 --> 01:32:30,686
...it'll be the smartest decision
you've ever made.

1237
01:32:30,865 --> 01:32:34,494
We want you, we need you,
but the other thing is, Mike, you need us.

1238
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:39,263
Ow!

1239
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:42,375
Knoxville is a tremendous place
to live and-

1240
01:32:42,543 --> 01:32:45,535
I know there's Lions,
there's Tigers, there's Bears.

1241
01:32:45,713 --> 01:32:47,840
Hey, there's only one Razorback
in the world.

1242
01:32:48,015 --> 01:32:51,746
And not only that, you will look great
in Gamecock red.

1243
01:32:51,919 --> 01:32:52,943
What's in it for me?

1244
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,817
SJ, I'm gonna get you a hog hat
and the whole family a hog hat.

1245
01:32:56,991 --> 01:32:59,118
Are you telling me that’s
the best you can do?

1246
01:32:59,293 --> 01:33:01,591
SJ, you remind me of me as a boy.

1247
01:33:01,762 --> 01:33:04,128
Coach, help me help you.

1248
01:33:04,298 --> 01:33:07,825
I can give you a Gamecock headdress,
and with real feathers.

1249
01:33:16,610 --> 01:33:20,011
- What do you got for me, Phil?
- I've been thinking a lot about that...

1250
01:33:20,181 --> 01:33:22,775
...and one of the things
I think would be special...

1251
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:26,943
...is we'll walk arm-in-arm to the center
of Neyland Stadium in the first ball game...

1252
01:33:27,121 --> 01:33:29,453
...and do the coin toss together.
How's that sound?

1253
01:33:29,623 --> 01:33:32,091
Coach Fulmer, it's a pleasure
doing business with you.

1254
01:33:32,259 --> 01:33:35,057
My pleasure, CJ. You bet you, buddy.

1255
01:33:45,372 --> 01:33:46,896
Congratulations on getting hired.

1256
01:33:47,074 --> 01:33:49,838
Thank you, ma'am.
Ole Miss is my dream job.

1257
01:33:50,010 --> 01:33:53,138
You're coming a little late to the party
and we're diehard Rebels...

1258
01:33:53,314 --> 01:33:55,748
...so I'm gonna pretty much
give you a road map.

1259
01:33:55,916 --> 01:33:57,543
- Got it.
- LSU is out.

1260
01:33:57,718 --> 01:33:59,709
Everybody knows Saban's
going to the NFL.

1261
01:33:59,887 --> 01:34:02,685
Don't wanna name names,
but on Michael’s first two trips...

1262
01:34:02,856 --> 01:34:05,120
- ...somebody took him to a titty bar.
- Terrible.

1263
01:34:05,292 --> 01:34:07,487
Tell me about it.
He had nightmares for weeks.

1264
01:34:07,661 --> 01:34:09,959
So when he visits,
I want you to feed him Italian.

1265
01:34:10,130 --> 01:34:12,724
He likes fettuccine Alfredo.
And take him to a movie.

1266
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:16,131
<i>Not Chainsaw Massacre
because he’ll just cover his eyes.</i>

1267
01:34:16,303 --> 01:34:18,703
Then get him in bed by 10. Got it?

1268
01:34:18,872 --> 01:34:20,066
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.

1269
01:34:20,241 --> 01:34:22,072
- What about Tennessee?
- Mm.

1270
01:34:22,409 --> 01:34:24,240
Breaks my heart,
but they're still in the hunt.

1271
01:34:24,411 --> 01:34:26,777
Ahem. Fulmer made SJ a sweet deal.

1272
01:34:26,947 --> 01:34:29,507
- I hear that kid can really pepper the gumbo.
- Hmm.

1273
01:34:29,683 --> 01:34:32,413
He's his daddy's boy. You ready?

1274
01:34:32,586 --> 01:34:34,486
- Let's do it.
- All right.

1275
01:34:34,655 --> 01:34:37,089
Mike, do you love barbecue?
I tell you what, Mike.

1276
01:34:37,258 --> 01:34:40,716
You can go to a gas station and
get the best barbecue you ever got.

1277
01:34:40,894 --> 01:34:42,361
It's a wonderful place to live.

1278
01:34:42,529 --> 01:34:46,693
Fried catfish, all the good food that
we love to eat and that's not good for us...

1279
01:34:46,867 --> 01:34:49,131
...you can have it there, Mike,
I promise you.

1280
01:34:49,303 --> 01:34:51,601
And for you, SJ, this is what I can do.

1281
01:34:51,772 --> 01:34:53,865
At Ole Miss, we have
The Grove by the stadium.

1282
01:34:54,041 --> 01:34:57,442
We walk it before every game
in front of thousands of people.

1283
01:34:57,611 --> 01:34:59,511
It's a sacred ritual. And I'm in front.

1284
01:35:00,047 --> 01:35:01,947
Seen it a thousand times.

1285
01:35:02,116 --> 01:35:05,882
Ever seen it from the front of the line?
Next year, you and me, leading the team.

1286
01:35:06,053 --> 01:35:09,989
Tennessee offered to let me
run on the field and flip the coin.

1287
01:35:12,926 --> 01:35:14,985
I'll throw in a sideline pass.

1288
01:35:25,272 --> 01:35:26,705
Have you decided yet, Michael?

1289
01:35:27,474 --> 01:35:29,374
No, Miss Sue.

1290
01:35:30,144 --> 01:35:32,510
But you like Tennessee?

1291
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:34,811
Yeah. That's a good school.

1292
01:35:35,916 --> 01:35:37,907
Not at the academic level of Ole Miss...

1293
01:35:38,085 --> 01:35:41,077
...but they have a outstanding
Science Department.

1294
01:35:41,955 --> 01:35:44,185
You know what they're famous for?

1295
01:35:44,625 --> 01:35:46,889
They work with the FBI...

1296
01:35:47,061 --> 01:35:51,020
...to study the effects of soil
on decomposing body parts.

1297
01:35:51,198 --> 01:35:52,893
What's that mean?

1298
01:35:53,067 --> 01:35:56,525
Well, when they find a body, the police
wanna know how long it's been dead.

1299
01:35:56,704 --> 01:35:59,639
So the fine folks at Tennessee
help them out.

1300
01:36:00,441 --> 01:36:03,137
Oh, they have lots of body parts.

1301
01:36:03,344 --> 01:36:07,405
Arms and legs and hands...

1302
01:36:07,581 --> 01:36:10,106
...from hospitals and medical schools.

1303
01:36:12,886 --> 01:36:14,751
And do you know where they store them?

1304
01:36:18,692 --> 01:36:20,853
Right underneath the football field.

1305
01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:27,558
So while it's fine and dandy
to have 100,000 fans cheering for you...

1306
01:36:27,735 --> 01:36:32,365
...the bodies you should be worried about
are the ones right under the turf.

1307
01:36:32,539 --> 01:36:35,633
Set to poke up through the ground
and grab you.

1308
01:36:40,447 --> 01:36:43,416
Well, it's your decision
where you wanna play ball.

1309
01:36:43,584 --> 01:36:45,779
Don't let me influence you.

1310
01:37:14,448 --> 01:37:17,713
All the other teachers are on board.
I don't know what your problem is.

1311
01:37:17,885 --> 01:37:21,821
I'm sorry. I will not give a student
a grade he or she doesn't deserve.

1312
01:37:22,122 --> 01:37:25,455
Well, Michael needs a B.

1313
01:37:25,626 --> 01:37:28,288
What does he have to do
to deserve that?

1314
01:37:29,963 --> 01:37:32,830
Right now Michael’s doing
C- minus, D-plus work.

1315
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:37,166
His best chance at improvement is
the written essay at the end of the year.

1316
01:37:37,337 --> 01:37:39,430
It counts for a third of the grade.

1317
01:37:40,808 --> 01:37:43,470
Well, that's it. We're sunk.

1318
01:37:44,845 --> 01:37:47,712
<i>Why don't you write about
Great Expectations?</i>

1319
01:37:47,881 --> 01:37:49,746
You're a lot like Pip.

1320
01:37:49,917 --> 01:37:55,378
I mean, he was poor. He was an orphan
and someone kind of found him.

1321
01:37:55,556 --> 01:37:57,456
You should be able to relate to that.

1322
01:38:01,528 --> 01:38:04,588
Fine. We'll go through the reading list.

1323
01:38:04,765 --> 01:38:07,461
But you're gonna have to pick one,
Michael.

1324
01:38:07,901 --> 01:38:08,925
<i>Pygmalion.</i>

1325
01:38:12,372 --> 01:38:14,203
<i>A Tale of Two Cities.</i>

1326
01:38:14,374 --> 01:38:16,239
"The Charge of the Light Brigade."

1327
01:38:16,410 --> 01:38:19,846
<i>Half a league, half a league
Half a league onward</i>

1328
01:38:20,013 --> 01:38:21,571
I love that one.

1329
01:38:21,949 --> 01:38:24,213
He loves it.

1330
01:38:25,886 --> 01:38:29,344
Why don't you do this?
And I'll watch basketball.

1331
01:38:33,093 --> 01:38:34,492
Okay.

1332
01:38:38,098 --> 01:38:41,727
<i>All in the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.</i>

1333
01:38:42,569 --> 01:38:46,528
They named LSU's stadium Death Valley
because of this story.

1334
01:38:47,608 --> 01:38:51,169
Alfred, Lord Tennyson
was writing about LSU-Ole Miss.

1335
01:38:51,345 --> 01:38:52,676
- You're kidding.
- No.

1336
01:38:52,846 --> 01:38:55,940
- It's a great story.
- It's a poem!

1337
01:38:56,116 --> 01:38:58,584
<i>"Forward, the Light Brigade!"</i>

1338
01:38:58,752 --> 01:39:00,083
That's like the offense.

1339
01:39:00,254 --> 01:39:02,381
<i>"Charge for the guns," he said:</i>

1340
01:39:02,556 --> 01:39:03,750
It's the end zone.

1341
01:39:04,291 --> 01:39:06,691
<i>Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.</i>

1342
01:39:06,860 --> 01:39:10,591
<i>"Forward, the Light Brigade!"
Was there a man dismay'd?</i>

1343
01:39:11,331 --> 01:39:14,664
<i>Not tho' the soldier knew
Someone had blunder'd:</i>

1344
01:39:14,835 --> 01:39:16,359
Someone made a mistake?

1345
01:39:16,937 --> 01:39:19,405
Yeah. Their leader.

1346
01:39:19,706 --> 01:39:20,934
Their coach.

1347
01:39:22,910 --> 01:39:27,040
But why would they go ahead
if they knew he messed up?

1348
01:39:29,683 --> 01:39:32,117
<i>Theirs not to make reply</i>

1349
01:39:32,452 --> 01:39:35,148
<i>Theirs not to reason why</i>

1350
01:39:35,522 --> 01:39:37,956
<i>Theirs but to do and die:</i>

1351
01:39:38,692 --> 01:39:41,661
<i>Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.</i>

1352
01:39:44,464 --> 01:39:46,159
They're all gonna die, aren't they?

1353
01:39:48,468 --> 01:39:49,492
Yeah.

1354
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:55,736
That's really, really sad.

1355
01:39:58,912 --> 01:40:01,745
I think you just found
something to write about, Michael.

1356
01:40:18,131 --> 01:40:20,599
<i>Courage is a hard thing to figure.</i>

1357
01:40:20,767 --> 01:40:24,635
<i>You can have courage based
on a dumb idea or a mistake...</i>

1358
01:40:24,805 --> 01:40:27,103
<i>...but you're not supposed to
question adults...</i>

1359
01:40:27,274 --> 01:40:31,506
<i>...or your coach or your teacher
because they make the rules.</i>

1360
01:40:32,479 --> 01:40:36,176
<i>Maybe they know best,
but maybe they don't.</i>

1361
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:41,277
<i>It all depends on who you are,
where you come from.</i>

1362
01:40:41,455 --> 01:40:44,322
<i>Didn't at least one of the 600 guys
think about giving up...</i>

1363
01:40:44,491 --> 01:40:46,721
<i>...and joining with the other side?</i>

1364
01:40:46,893 --> 01:40:50,727
<i>I mean, valley of Death,
that's pretty salty stuff.</i>

1365
01:40:53,166 --> 01:40:54,963
<i>That's why courage is tricky.</i>

1366
01:40:56,003 --> 01:40:59,370
<i>Should you always do
what others tell you to do?</i>

1367
01:41:00,007 --> 01:41:03,170
<i>Sometimes you might not even know
why you're doing something.</i>

1368
01:41:03,343 --> 01:41:06,039
<i>I mean, any fool can have courage.</i>

1369
01:41:06,847 --> 01:41:10,840
<i>But honor, that's the real reason
you either do something or you don't.</i>

1370
01:41:11,418 --> 01:41:14,353
<i>It's who you are
and maybe who you want to be.</i>

1371
01:41:15,756 --> 01:41:17,917
<i>If you die trying for
something important...</i>

1372
01:41:18,091 --> 01:41:22,551
<i>...then you have both honor and
courage, and that's pretty good.</i>

1373
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:25,428
<i>I think that's what the writer was saying.</i>

1374
01:41:25,599 --> 01:41:29,433
<i>That you should hope for courage
and try for honor.</i>

1375
01:41:29,603 --> 01:41:35,166
<i>And maybe even pray that the people
telling you what to do have some too.</i>

1376
01:41:39,212 --> 01:41:40,873
Kevin Lin.

1377
01:41:45,919 --> 01:41:48,820
- Good job.
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

1378
01:41:50,157 --> 01:41:53,092
Matthew Nichols.

1379
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:56,695
- 2.52.
- Hmm?

1380
01:41:56,897 --> 01:42:01,129
Michael’s final GPA.
Got it off of Paul’s computer.

1381
01:42:01,334 --> 01:42:03,393
He did it, Sean. He did it.

1382
01:42:04,104 --> 01:42:06,402
Wait a minute. You broke into
the principal’s computer?

1383
01:42:06,573 --> 01:42:08,040
Hmm?

1384
01:42:09,109 --> 01:42:10,872
Michael Oher.

1385
01:42:15,182 --> 01:42:17,013
Michael.

1386
01:42:17,918 --> 01:42:20,614
Where in the world did you find
a baby picture of Michael?

1387
01:42:20,787 --> 01:42:23,722
Scanned it off an Internet ad
for a toddler boutique.

1388
01:42:30,097 --> 01:42:32,861
- Congratulations, Michael.
Thank you.

1389
01:42:48,415 --> 01:42:49,848
Michael, up top!

1390
01:42:53,286 --> 01:42:54,753
Way to go, bro.

1391
01:42:55,422 --> 01:42:56,855
All right, that's enough.

1392
01:42:57,023 --> 01:43:00,481
Young man, I think I need a proper hug.

1393
01:43:05,966 --> 01:43:08,434
You're gonna be staying
in Deaton Hall. Where is it?

1394
01:43:08,602 --> 01:43:09,899
It's 109. It's right there.

1395
01:43:10,070 --> 01:43:13,631
You'll be on the meal plan so you’ll be
eating over here in Johnson Commons.

1396
01:43:13,807 --> 01:43:15,900
Johnson Commons, all-you-can-eat
self-serve ice cream.

1397
01:43:16,076 --> 01:43:17,168
- Mm-hm.
- As much as you want?

1398
01:43:18,545 --> 01:43:20,672
That's how Mama put on
her freshman 10.

1399
01:43:22,082 --> 01:43:25,483
- Stop it.
- Whew.

1400
01:43:26,219 --> 01:43:27,880
Hello.

1401
01:43:29,456 --> 01:43:30,923
This is Mrs. Tuohy.

1402
01:43:31,091 --> 01:43:35,391
They just wanna ask you a couple questions,
Michael. You have nothing to hide.

1403
01:43:36,196 --> 01:43:38,824
Mrs. Tuohy? Mr. Oher?
My name is Jocelyn Granger.

1404
01:43:38,999 --> 01:43:41,524
I'm the Assistant Director of
Enforcement for the NCAA.

1405
01:43:41,701 --> 01:43:43,134
Please, call me Leigh Anne.

1406
01:43:46,673 --> 01:43:48,300
So let's do this, shall we?

1407
01:43:48,475 --> 01:43:51,740
If you wouldn't mind,
I'd prefer to speak with Michael alone.

1408
01:43:52,379 --> 01:43:54,074
And how long is that gonna take?

1409
01:43:54,247 --> 01:43:55,373
A while.

1410
01:43:57,784 --> 01:43:59,718
It's all right. It's okay.

1411
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:01,512
Go on.

1412
01:44:04,191 --> 01:44:05,215
Michael.

1413
01:44:05,392 --> 01:44:08,987
Michael. I'll be waiting for you
in the lobby, all right?

1414
01:44:12,732 --> 01:44:13,926
<i>I don't know, Sean.</i>

1415
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:16,330
Just have a bad feeling about this one.

1416
01:44:16,503 --> 01:44:19,165
This woman is tough, tough, tough,
tough, tough. Hold on.

1417
01:44:20,207 --> 01:44:21,731
Hey.

1418
01:44:22,676 --> 01:44:24,576
The client wants what?

1419
01:44:25,512 --> 01:44:28,572
Were you aware that Coach Cotton
was accepting a job at Ole Miss?

1420
01:44:28,748 --> 01:44:29,772
No.

1421
01:44:29,950 --> 01:44:32,612
And that this job offer came
after you signed with them?

1422
01:44:33,854 --> 01:44:36,516
Sean Tuohy, your legal guardian,
went to Ole Miss.

1423
01:44:36,690 --> 01:44:37,714
He played basketball.

1424
01:44:38,325 --> 01:44:40,793
And Mrs. Tuohy went to Ole Miss
as well.

1425
01:44:40,961 --> 01:44:42,258
She was a cheerleader.

1426
01:44:42,429 --> 01:44:45,023
Is it safe to say that Ole Miss
is their favorite school?

1427
01:44:45,198 --> 01:44:49,567
Do they like any other universities?
What about, say, Tennessee?

1428
01:44:49,736 --> 01:44:51,226
No, they can't stand Tennessee.

1429
01:44:52,939 --> 01:44:54,065
And your tutor.

1430
01:44:54,241 --> 01:44:56,471
- Miss Sue?
- Miss Sue.

1431
01:44:56,643 --> 01:44:59,578
Miss Sue is an Ole Miss grad too.

1432
01:45:00,046 --> 01:45:02,879
Miss Sue ever try to persuade you
to attend Ole Miss?

1433
01:45:08,555 --> 01:45:11,888
Did you know that the Tuohys
make generous donations to Ole Miss?

1434
01:45:12,058 --> 01:45:14,720
That even Miss Sue makes donations?

1435
01:45:14,895 --> 01:45:17,022
That the Tuohys,
they have a condo in Oxford...

1436
01:45:17,197 --> 01:45:20,132
...so they can attend
as many athletic events as possible.

1437
01:45:20,367 --> 01:45:25,634
That in fact, both Sean and Leigh Anne
Tuohy are by our definition boosters.

1438
01:45:27,974 --> 01:45:29,771
Mr. Oher.

1439
01:45:30,076 --> 01:45:31,907
Mr. Oher.

1440
01:45:32,078 --> 01:45:35,013
Do you understand?
Do you know why I'm here?

1441
01:45:36,283 --> 01:45:37,807
To investigate?

1442
01:45:37,984 --> 01:45:40,976
Yes. To investigate.

1443
01:45:41,154 --> 01:45:44,954
I'm here to investigate
your odd... predicament.

1444
01:45:45,892 --> 01:45:49,658
Do you find it odd, your predicament?

1445
01:45:51,464 --> 01:45:53,193
Michael.

1446
01:45:53,767 --> 01:45:55,735
I don't know.

1447
01:45:56,736 --> 01:46:00,672
- Can I-? Can I leave now?
- No, you can't.

1448
01:46:01,908 --> 01:46:03,034
What do you want, ma'am?

1449
01:46:03,209 --> 01:46:05,734
- I want the facts. I need the truth.
- I didn't lie.

1450
01:46:05,912 --> 01:46:08,881
- I wanna know what you think about this.
- Think about what?!

1451
01:46:18,425 --> 01:46:22,657
The NCAA fears that
with your recruitment...

1452
01:46:22,829 --> 01:46:24,160
...a door might be opened...

1453
01:46:24,631 --> 01:46:26,724
...that boosters from schools
in the South...

1454
01:46:26,900 --> 01:46:29,892
...will become legal guardians
of young athletes without means...

1455
01:46:30,070 --> 01:46:32,470
...and funnel them to their alma maters.

1456
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:35,836
I'm not saying I believe it.
I'm not saying I don't.

1457
01:46:36,009 --> 01:46:39,809
But there are many people involved in this
case who would argue that the Tuohys...

1458
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:42,312
- ...they took you in, they clothed you...
- No.

1459
01:46:42,482 --> 01:46:45,417
...they fed you, they paid for
your private education.

1460
01:46:45,585 --> 01:46:48,486
- They bought you a car, paid for a tutor...
- No. No.

1461
01:46:48,655 --> 01:46:53,649
...all as part of a plan to ensure that you
play football for the University of Mississippi.

1462
01:47:11,244 --> 01:47:14,441
Michael? We're not finished.

1463
01:47:14,614 --> 01:47:17,139
The toile's not available,
like I told you months ago.

1464
01:47:17,317 --> 01:47:21,845
So why don't we go with the ticking?
The low nap. It's a beautiful-

1465
01:47:22,022 --> 01:47:25,253
I'll call you back. Bye.
Michael. So, what happened?

1466
01:47:25,558 --> 01:47:28,118
- Why'd you do it?
- What?

1467
01:47:28,294 --> 01:47:30,762
All along you wanted me
to go to Ole Miss.

1468
01:47:30,930 --> 01:47:32,955
Well, of course I did. We love Ole Miss.

1469
01:47:33,133 --> 01:47:34,600
- Why'd you do this for me?
- What?

1470
01:47:34,768 --> 01:47:38,033
Everything. Was it for you
or was it for me?

1471
01:47:38,204 --> 01:47:41,139
Was it so I would go to school
where you wanted?

1472
01:47:41,307 --> 01:47:43,468
Was it so I would do what you wanted?

1473
01:47:43,643 --> 01:47:46,043
- Michael, no, I-
- That's what she thinks.

1474
01:47:46,746 --> 01:47:47,974
Is she right?

1475
01:47:48,515 --> 01:47:50,915
Michael, honey, I need for you
to just listen to me.

1476
01:47:51,084 --> 01:47:52,642
Don't you dare lie to me.

1477
01:47:56,122 --> 01:47:57,646
I'm not stupid.

1478
01:47:57,824 --> 01:48:03,285
Michael? Michael, of course
you're not stupid, Michael. Mi-

1479
01:48:07,033 --> 01:48:08,728
I should've followed him.

1480
01:48:08,902 --> 01:48:10,893
You had no way of knowing
he'd disappear.

1481
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:15,974
Was he right?

1482
01:48:16,543 --> 01:48:18,534
What he said about us?

1483
01:48:18,711 --> 01:48:20,269
Leigh Anne, be reasonable.

1484
01:48:20,447 --> 01:48:24,213
We gave clothes to a boy who had one
pair of shorts and we gave him a bed.

1485
01:48:24,384 --> 01:48:27,649
To hell with the NCAA.
I would do it again tomorrow.

1486
01:48:27,821 --> 01:48:30,312
What about all the rest of it?

1487
01:48:30,490 --> 01:48:34,085
All the stuff we did to make sure
that he got a scholarship.

1488
01:48:34,727 --> 01:48:36,752
A scholarship to Ole Miss.

1489
01:48:37,464 --> 01:48:40,024
He could go anywhere he wanted.
He knew that.

1490
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:44,933
Oh, did he? Did you ask him?
Because I sure as hell know I never did.

1491
01:48:47,807 --> 01:48:51,174
Hey. Come here.

1492
01:48:59,285 --> 01:49:01,310
Yeah.

1493
01:49:07,694 --> 01:49:10,094
Am I a good person?

1494
01:49:10,263 --> 01:49:12,094
Not a joke.

1495
01:49:12,265 --> 01:49:14,460
Not rhetorical.

1496
01:49:16,136 --> 01:49:20,038
You are the best person that I know.

1497
01:49:21,307 --> 01:49:25,141
Everything you do, you do for others.

1498
01:49:26,613 --> 01:49:29,207
And why is that?

1499
01:49:31,351 --> 01:49:33,876
I have not a clue.

1500
01:49:34,721 --> 01:49:39,351
But you obviously get some sort of
sick satisfaction out of it.

1501
01:49:44,097 --> 01:49:46,861
- Sean.
- Yeah?

1502
01:49:47,133 --> 01:49:49,966
What if he never comes back?

1503
01:49:56,309 --> 01:49:59,608
Oh. Heh. Whoo!

1504
01:49:59,779 --> 01:50:03,681
Big Mike. Hey, get your ass
on in here, man.

1505
01:50:03,850 --> 01:50:06,216
- I'm looking for my mama.
- Your mama?

1506
01:50:06,386 --> 01:50:08,616
Yeah, I seen Dee Dee around.

1507
01:50:08,788 --> 01:50:11,018
As a matter of fact...

1508
01:50:11,191 --> 01:50:14,592
Oh, yeah, she usually stop by
for a taste around this time.

1509
01:50:14,994 --> 01:50:17,792
Look, I tell you what,
why don't you just come on inside?

1510
01:50:17,964 --> 01:50:23,402
I'm gonna get you a 40, we gonna chop
it up like real folk. Just until she get here.

1511
01:50:25,205 --> 01:50:28,402
Come on, now.
Ain't nobody gonna bite you, baby.

1512
01:50:36,783 --> 01:50:37,772
Hey.

1513
01:50:37,951 --> 01:50:41,148
Hey, Big Mike, go on down there
in the living room, man. Have a seat.

1514
01:50:41,321 --> 01:50:42,948
Liven this bitch up in here, y’all.

1515
01:50:43,122 --> 01:50:45,386
Give me a couple of 40s
out that refrigerator.

1516
01:50:45,558 --> 01:50:47,150
- Sit down, man.
- Big Mike, boy.

1517
01:50:47,327 --> 01:50:48,919
Damn, sure good to see you.

1518
01:50:49,162 --> 01:50:52,222
Yeah, you looking good too.
You looking fit.

1519
01:50:52,398 --> 01:50:53,990
I heard you playing a little ball.

1520
01:50:55,168 --> 01:50:59,161
Y'all know that old rich-kid football ain't
got nothing on that public-school league.

1521
01:50:59,339 --> 01:51:01,307
Niggas packing knives in they socks.

1522
01:51:03,309 --> 01:51:05,573
Hey. I played a little ball myself.

1523
01:51:05,745 --> 01:51:08,908
- Back in the day. You knew that, right?
- Yeah, I heard.

1524
01:51:09,115 --> 01:51:13,449
Little quarterback. Up there at MLK.
Yeah.

1525
01:51:13,886 --> 01:51:14,910
Thank you, baby.

1526
01:51:15,088 --> 01:51:18,251
What about you, David?
You still playing ball over at JC?

1527
01:51:18,424 --> 01:51:21,552
- Naw, br-
- No, man. David ain't with that no more.

1528
01:51:21,728 --> 01:51:23,252
He with me now.

1529
01:51:23,429 --> 01:51:27,593
As a matter of fact, look,
I can open up a spot for you too.

1530
01:51:27,767 --> 01:51:31,430
I got tired of going to class.
People always trying to tell me what to do.

1531
01:51:31,604 --> 01:51:36,132
Well, in that case, then, look here,
turn that up right there, little-bitty bitch!

1532
01:51:36,609 --> 01:51:39,271
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Bitty bitch!

1533
01:51:41,681 --> 01:51:44,673
Hey, man. I'm just messing with D, man.

1534
01:51:45,318 --> 01:51:48,719
Ahh. I heard you staying
on the other side of town.

1535
01:51:49,522 --> 01:51:54,186
Yeah, that what Dee Dee said. Said you
got you a new mama now. Yeah, man.

1536
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:56,294
Hell, yeah.
She fine too.

1537
01:51:56,462 --> 01:51:58,760
Yeah, she fine. Mm-mm. Ooh!

1538
01:51:59,065 --> 01:52:01,499
Hey, she got any other kids?

1539
01:52:04,637 --> 01:52:06,332
She got a daughter?

1540
01:52:08,074 --> 01:52:10,008
You tap that?

1541
01:52:12,545 --> 01:52:15,343
Yeah. Yeah, you tapped that, didn't you?
Yeah.

1542
01:52:15,515 --> 01:52:16,675
Big Mike!

1543
01:52:16,849 --> 01:52:20,307
Big Mike done got a little piece,
y’all! He can't stand hisself now.

1544
01:52:20,486 --> 01:52:22,044
Hey, Big-

1545
01:52:22,322 --> 01:52:24,586
He done- He done lost his mind.

1546
01:52:24,757 --> 01:52:25,849
Hey, where you going?

1547
01:52:26,025 --> 01:52:28,493
I'm gonna just go wait for Mama
at the apartment.

1548
01:52:32,231 --> 01:52:34,324
Hey, man. Just go on heading on.

1549
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:39,631
Sit down. I'm just trying to find
out a little bit about your fine white sister.

1550
01:52:39,839 --> 01:52:42,808
Because I likes me some of
that mommy-daughter action.

1551
01:52:42,975 --> 01:52:45,000
Shut up.

1552
01:52:48,915 --> 01:52:50,382
"Shut up"?

1553
01:52:50,550 --> 01:52:53,542
Who in the hell is you telling to shut up?

1554
01:52:56,122 --> 01:52:58,682
I will bust a cap in your fat ass...

1555
01:52:58,858 --> 01:53:01,918
...and then drive east to pay a visit
to your cracker-ass mama...

1556
01:53:02,095 --> 01:53:03,392
...and her sweet little daughter.

1557
01:53:07,166 --> 01:53:08,258
Big fella.

1558
01:53:18,811 --> 01:53:20,608
My baby!

1559
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:23,747
You monster! Get out!

1560
01:53:36,262 --> 01:53:37,456
- Mama!
- Mama!

1561
01:54:00,186 --> 01:54:03,019
He gone, snowflake.

1562
01:54:08,828 --> 01:54:10,352
Michael was here?

1563
01:54:10,530 --> 01:54:14,466
Yeah, but you tell him I'll be seeing
him around. Oh, he gonna get his.

1564
01:54:15,234 --> 01:54:16,792
So Michael was here?

1565
01:54:17,203 --> 01:54:19,899
Last night. Gonna come by here
and sneak me then run off.

1566
01:54:20,740 --> 01:54:23,607
Yeah. Tell him to sleep
with one eye open.

1567
01:54:24,811 --> 01:54:25,971
You hear me, bitch?

1568
01:54:32,518 --> 01:54:34,782
No, you hear me, bitch.

1569
01:54:35,555 --> 01:54:39,150
You threaten my son, you threaten me.

1570
01:54:39,325 --> 01:54:42,954
You so much as cross into downtown,
you will be sorry.

1571
01:54:43,129 --> 01:54:44,858
I'm in a prayer group with the DA...

1572
01:54:45,031 --> 01:54:47,795
...I'm a member of the NRA,
and I'm always packing.

1573
01:54:53,172 --> 01:54:56,471
What you got in there, a. 22?
Or a Saturday Night Special?

1574
01:54:57,844 --> 01:55:01,336
Mm-hm. And it shoots just fine
all the other days too.

1575
01:55:26,906 --> 01:55:28,271
<i>- Michael?
Mama?</i>

1576
01:55:56,569 --> 01:55:58,764
<i>You think the police
are gonna come and get me?</i>

1577
01:55:59,772 --> 01:56:02,297
I imagine the last thing
they want in Hurt Village...

1578
01:56:02,475 --> 01:56:05,239
...is a bunch of cops snooping around.

1579
01:56:08,214 --> 01:56:13,151
I swore I would never ask this, but
how did you get out of there, Michael?

1580
01:56:15,888 --> 01:56:19,483
When I was little and
something awful was happening...

1581
01:56:19,659 --> 01:56:21,820
...my mama would tell me
to close my eyes.

1582
01:56:22,662 --> 01:56:26,564
She was trying to keep me from
seeing her do drugs or other bad things.

1583
01:56:27,199 --> 01:56:30,168
And when she was finished
or the bad things were over...

1584
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:35,672
...she'd say, "Now when I count to
three, you open your eyes.

1585
01:56:35,841 --> 01:56:41,336
The past is gone, the world is a good
place, and it's all gonna be okay."

1586
01:56:44,150 --> 01:56:46,448
You closed your eyes.

1587
01:56:49,021 --> 01:56:53,481
You know, when I was driving
all over kingdom come looking for you...

1588
01:56:53,659 --> 01:56:56,389
...I kept thinking about one thing.

1589
01:56:57,363 --> 01:56:59,331
Ferdinand the Bull.

1590
01:57:02,368 --> 01:57:06,168
I know I should've asked you this
a long time ago, Michael.

1591
01:57:06,872 --> 01:57:09,033
But do you even wanna play football?

1592
01:57:10,543 --> 01:57:13,034
I mean, do you even like it?

1593
01:57:13,913 --> 01:57:15,312
I'm pretty good at it.

1594
01:57:15,715 --> 01:57:17,580
Yeah, you are.

1595
01:57:20,119 --> 01:57:21,780
Sean and I have been talking and...

1596
01:57:22,288 --> 01:57:25,724
...Michael, if you're gonna
accept a football scholarship...

1597
01:57:26,559 --> 01:57:29,619
...we think it should be to Tennessee.

1598
01:57:31,731 --> 01:57:37,192
And I promise that I will be
at every game, cheering for you.

1599
01:57:37,837 --> 01:57:40,431
- Every game?
- Every game.

1600
01:57:41,841 --> 01:57:45,140
But I will not wear that gaudy orange.
I will not.

1601
01:57:45,311 --> 01:57:47,871
It is not in my color wheel
and I'm not gonna wear it.

1602
01:57:50,883 --> 01:57:53,875
So you want me to go to Tennessee?

1603
01:57:54,654 --> 01:57:58,146
I want you to do whatever you want.

1604
01:57:58,324 --> 01:58:01,225
It is your decision, Michael.
It's your life.

1605
01:58:03,162 --> 01:58:05,096
What if I wanted to flip burgers?

1606
01:58:08,834 --> 01:58:11,735
It's your decision. It's your life.

1607
01:58:14,607 --> 01:58:16,404
Okay.

1608
01:58:17,677 --> 01:58:19,076
Okay, what?

1609
01:58:21,480 --> 01:58:23,277
<i>I'm sorry I left the other day.</i>

1610
01:58:23,449 --> 01:58:24,882
You were pretty upset.

1611
01:58:25,051 --> 01:58:28,612
- You asked a lot of questions.
- I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this.

1612
01:58:28,788 --> 01:58:30,722
But all the questions you asked...

1613
01:58:30,890 --> 01:58:33,859
...were about why everybody else
wanted me to go to Ole Miss.

1614
01:58:34,026 --> 01:58:35,050
Okay.

1615
01:58:35,227 --> 01:58:37,889
Not once did you ask
why did I wanna go there.

1616
01:58:39,965 --> 01:58:41,125
All right.

1617
01:58:41,300 --> 01:58:44,895
Fine, Michael. Why do you
wanna go to Ole Miss?

1618
01:58:45,071 --> 01:58:48,199
Because it's where my family
goes to school.

1619
01:58:48,841 --> 01:58:50,809
It's where they've always
gone to school.

1620
01:58:58,718 --> 01:59:00,913
College will be a different
experience for you.

1621
01:59:01,087 --> 01:59:02,076
SJ, stop it.

1622
01:59:02,254 --> 01:59:04,654
- There's gonna be lots of distractions.
- Have fun.

1623
01:59:04,824 --> 01:59:08,783
Always gonna be some nimrod in the dorm
who wants to play video games all night...

1624
01:59:08,961 --> 01:59:10,792
...or fool around on the Internet.

1625
01:59:10,963 --> 01:59:12,055
Just have fun.

1626
01:59:12,231 --> 01:59:14,392
You'll be spending
a lot of time at practice...

1627
01:59:14,567 --> 01:59:18,128
...which means you’ll have to be
very dedicated to your studies, all right?

1628
01:59:18,304 --> 01:59:20,499
SJ, if you don't stop it right-
Come here.

1629
01:59:20,673 --> 01:59:22,197
Relax, Mama.

1630
01:59:22,408 --> 01:59:26,401
I just got back from the library. I reserved
a private cubicle for the semester.

1631
01:59:26,579 --> 01:59:29,309
Here's your class schedule
and our study-hall hours.

1632
01:59:29,482 --> 01:59:32,849
Now, if y’all don't mind, I'm gonna
go move into my new apartment.

1633
01:59:33,018 --> 01:59:35,316
- Thank you, Miss Sue.
Thank you, Miss Sue.

1634
01:59:35,488 --> 01:59:37,956
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's see what you got.

1635
01:59:38,124 --> 01:59:41,719
College Writing, good. Psychology,
Math Lab, which is gonna be good-

1636
01:59:41,894 --> 01:59:43,828
- Hi.
Well, you know why.

1637
01:59:43,996 --> 01:59:45,520
A lot of good classes.

1638
01:59:45,698 --> 01:59:48,462
- You gonna have a lot of fun.
SJ!

1639
01:59:51,537 --> 01:59:54,506
Michael Oher, you listen to me,
all right?

1640
01:59:54,673 --> 01:59:58,268
I want you to enjoy yourself, but if
you get a girl pregnant out of wedlock...

1641
01:59:58,444 --> 02:00:02,540
...I will crawl in the car, drive up here
to Oxford, and I will cut off your penis.

1642
02:00:02,882 --> 02:00:03,940
She means it.

1643
02:00:05,317 --> 02:00:07,785
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.

1644
02:00:10,289 --> 02:00:13,725
Well, the 78's gonna be a parking lot
so we should get going.

1645
02:00:13,893 --> 02:00:17,420
I want everyone to say their goodbyes,
all right? Here. Bye, baby.

1646
02:00:17,596 --> 02:00:19,257
Thank you, Mama.
- You're welcome.

1647
02:00:29,008 --> 02:00:31,033
Why does she always do that?

1648
02:00:31,577 --> 02:00:35,707
She's an onion, Michael. You have to
peel her back a layer at a time.

1649
02:00:38,450 --> 02:00:40,145
Be right back.

1650
02:00:51,297 --> 02:00:53,094
What?

1651
02:00:59,238 --> 02:01:00,262
What, Michael?

1652
02:01:00,806 --> 02:01:03,104
I need a proper hug.

1653
02:01:26,232 --> 02:01:29,724
<i>I read a story the other day
about a boy from the projects.</i>

1654
02:01:30,636 --> 02:01:34,128
<i>No daddy, in and out of foster care.</i>

1655
02:01:34,607 --> 02:01:38,338
<i>He'd been killed in a gang fight
at Hurt Village.</i>

1656
02:01:38,744 --> 02:01:43,204
<i>In the last paragraph, they talked about
his superb athletic skills...</i>

1657
02:01:43,382 --> 02:01:45,475
<i>...and how different
his life might've been...</i>

1658
02:01:45,651 --> 02:01:48,586
<i>...if he hadn't fallen behind
and dropped out of school.</i>

1659
02:01:48,754 --> 02:01:52,349
<i>He was 21 years old the day he died.</i>

1660
02:01:52,524 --> 02:01:54,890
<i>It was his birthday.</i>

1661
02:02:00,165 --> 02:02:02,190
<i>That could have been anyone.</i>

1662
02:02:02,368 --> 02:02:05,201
<i>It could've been my son, Michael.</i>

1663
02:02:05,804 --> 02:02:07,829
<i>But it wasn't.</i>

1664
02:02:10,643 --> 02:02:13,908
<i>And I suppose I have God
to thank for that.</i>

1665
02:02:16,649 --> 02:02:19,914
<i>God and Lawrence Taylor.</i>

1666
02:02:31,096 --> 02:02:32,757
<i>One Mississippi.</i>

1667
02:03:09,601 --> 02:03:15,130
The New England Patriots have traded
the 23rd pick to the Baltimore Ravens.

1668
02:03:15,307 --> 02:03:18,799
And with the 23rd pick
in the 2009 NFL draft...

1669
02:03:18,978 --> 02:03:24,678
...the Baltimore Ravens select Michael
Oher, offensive tackle, Mississippi.
