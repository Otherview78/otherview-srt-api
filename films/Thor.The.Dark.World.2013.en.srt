1
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:38,623
<i>Long before the birth of light,
there was darkness.</i>

2
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,835
<i>And from that darkness
came the Dark Elves.</i>

3
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:48,424
<i>Millennia ago,
the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith</i>

4
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:53,429
<i>sought to transform our universe
back into one of eternal night.</i>

5
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,603
<i>Such evil was possible
through the power of the Aether,</i>

6
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:04,482
<i>an ancient force of infinite destruction.</i>

7
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:08,778
Malekith.

8
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:10,655
Asgard's forces are upon us.

9
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,376
<i>The noble armies of Asgard,
led by my father, King Bor,</i>

10
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:26,420
<i>waged a mighty war
against these creatures.</i>

11
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,684
Send in the Kursed!

12
00:01:56,492 --> 00:01:59,287
<i>As the Nine Worlds
converged above him,</i>

13
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,833
<i>Malekith could at last
unleash the Aether.</i>

14
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,140
Ahh!

15
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:25,229
<i>But Asgard ripped
the weapon from his grasp.</i>

16
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:28,441
<i>Without it, the Dark Elves fell.</i>

17
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:44,915
<i>With the battle all but lost,</i>

18
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,585
<i>Malekith sacrificed his own people</i>

19
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:52,465
<i>in a desperate attempt
to lay waste to Asgard's army.</i>

20
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:57,636
Their deaths will mean our survival.

21
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,098
This war is far from over.

22
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:14,320
<i>Malekith was vanquished,
and the Aether was no more.</i>

23
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:17,239
<i>Or so we were led to believe.</i>

24
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:22,036
Sire, the Aether. Shall we destroy it?

25
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,081
If only we could.

26
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,083
But its power is too great.

27
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:30,169
Bury it deep.

28
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,713
Somewhere no one will ever find it.

29
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:15,548
Loki.

30
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,258
Hello, Mother.

31
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,635
Have I made you proud?

32
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:22,179
Please, don't make this worse.

33
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,098
Define "worse."

34
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:25,850
Enough!

35
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,310
I will speak to the prisoner alone.

36
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,702
I really don't see
what all the fuss is about.

37
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:48,247
Do you not truly feel
the gravity of your crimes?

38
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:51,208
Wherever you go, there is war, ruin,

39
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:53,377
and death.

40
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:57,756
I went down to Midgard to rule the
people of Earth as a benevolent god.

41
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,092
Just like you.

42
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:04,054
We are not gods.
We are born, we live, we die.

43
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,599
Just as humans do.

44
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:09,935
Give or take 5,000 years.

45
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:13,856
All this because Loki desires a throne.

46
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:15,357
It is my birthright.

47
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,861
Your birthright was to die

48
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,905
as a child.

49
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,492
Cast out onto a frozen rock.

50
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,621
If I had not taken you in,

51
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,415
you would not be here now to hate me.

52
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:33,709
If I am for the axe,
then for mercy's sake,

53
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,295
just swing it.

54
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,506
It's not that I don't love our little talks,

55
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,591
it's just...

56
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,344
I don't love them.

57
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,679
Frigga is the only reason
you're still alive,

58
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,181
and you will never see her again.

59
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:52,394
You will spend the rest of your days
in the dungeons.

60
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:57,650
And what of Thor?

61
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,862
You'll make that witless oaf king
while I rot in chains.

62
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:05,533
Thor must strive to undo
the damage you have done.

63
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,201
He will bring order to the Nine Realms

64
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:09,328
and then, yes...

65
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:12,164
He will be king.

66
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,008
Ah!

67
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:53,008
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

68
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,255
I've got this completely under control!

69
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,465
Is that why everything is on fire?

70
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,440
Ah!

71
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,033
You're welcome.

72
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:32,703
Ha!

73
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:51,764
All yours.

74
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,371
Hello.

75
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,292
I accept your surrender.

76
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,515
Anyone else?

77
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:45,943
Perhaps next time
we should start with the big one.

78
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,154
Keep moving. Come on!

79
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,085
Keep moving. Go ahead of me.
Don't you turn around!

80
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:05,879
Where do we go next?

81
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:10,008
Hogun, the peace
is nearly won across the Nine Realms.

82
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:13,679
You should stay here. Be with
your people, where your heart is.

83
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:15,431
Asgard can wait.

84
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,809
You have my thanks.

85
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,645
As you have mine.

86
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,443
Heimdall, when you're ready.

87
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,364
Is Vanaheim secure?

88
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,991
As are Nornheim and Ria.

89
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,494
Though our work would have gone
more quickly with you at the fore.

90
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:23,874
You must think I'm a piece of bread
that needs to be buttered so heavily.

91
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,126
That was not my intent.

92
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:28,629
For the first time
since Bifrost was destroyed,

93
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,506
the Nine Realms are at peace.

94
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,091
They're well reminded of our strength

95
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:37,888
and you have earned their respect
and my gratitude.

96
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,097
Thank you.

97
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,725
Nothing out of order

98
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:45,020
except your confused
and distracted heart.

99
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,439
This isn't about Jane Foster, Father.

100
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,149
Human lives are fleeting,
they're nothing.

101
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,568
You'd be better served
by what lies in front of you.

102
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,031
I'm telling you this, not as the Allfather,

103
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,157
but as your father.

104
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,242
You are ready.

105
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,369
The time has come
for you to take the throne.

106
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,246
Embrace and celebrate
what you've won.

107
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,373
Join your warriors.

108
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,917
Eat and drink, revel in their celebration.

109
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:10,379
At least pretend to enjoy yourself.

110
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,550
Another!

111
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:15,861
There was a time
when you would celebrate for weeks.

112
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:20,282
I remember you celebrated
the Battle of Harokin

113
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,659
so much that you nearly
started the second.

114
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,329
Well, the first was so much fun.

115
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,837
Take a drink with me.

116
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,007
Surely, the Allfather could have
no further task for you tonight.

117
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,009
No, this is one I set myself.

118
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:44,056
It does not go unnoticed
that you disappear each night.

119
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,433
There are nine realms.

120
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,561
The future king of Asgard
must focus on more than one.

121
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,401
I thank you for your sword

122
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:59,613
and for your counsel, good Lady Sif.

123
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:21,093
Hi.

124
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,428
Hi.

125
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,888
So, what's the story with you?

126
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,557
Why does there have to be a story?
There's no story.

127
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,977
You spent the first
ten minutes of our date

128
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,020
hiding behind a menu
that has three choices on it.

129
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,523
It's either chicken,
vegetarian, or fish, Jane.

130
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,733
I think there's a story

131
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,070
and I'm thinking
the story involves a guy.

132
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,072
It's complicated.

133
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,407
Is he still around?

134
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,534
No, he...

135
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,202
Went away.

136
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:48,745
I've been there.

137
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,956
The going away. It's hard, isn't it?

138
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:52,457
I was seeing a woman

139
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,418
and she took a job in New York.

140
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,878
Eventually, the distance killed it.

141
00:13:57,087 --> 00:14:00,424
And the fact
that she kept sleeping with other dudes.

142
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,175
- No!
- Oh, so many.

143
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,346
Hi. Could we get some wine, please?

144
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:07,556
Sure, I'd love some.

145
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,266
Richard, this is Darcy.

146
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,768
What are you doing here?

147
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:14,980
Oh. Hello.

148
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,817
So, I show up to work
at the lab/your mom's house,

149
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:22,654
fully expecting you
to be moping around in your pajamas,

150
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,489
eating ice cream and obsessing about...

151
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:25,657
You know who.

152
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:26,867
Ah.

153
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,411
But you're not.
You're wearing lady clothes.

154
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,121
You even showered, didn't you?
You smell good.

155
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,247
Is there a point to all this?

156
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,332
Because there really needs
to be a point to all this.

157
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,667
Right.

158
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,378
You know all that scientific equipment
you don't look at anymore?

159
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:41,256
You might want
to start looking at it again.

160
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,425
This is the reason
we came all the way out here.

161
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,551
It's malfunctioning.

162
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,635
That's what I said.

163
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,597
That's what I did.

164
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,640
I thought you would do something
a little more scientific.

165
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,350
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- Yeah, it's...

166
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:53,602
It doesn't look like nothing.

167
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,937
It kind of looks like the readings
that Erik was rambling about.

168
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,355
Our friend Erik

169
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,483
kind of went banana balls.

170
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:00,567
He's not interested.

171
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,651
- I'm not interested.
- I'm interested.

172
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,320
It's time for you to go now.

173
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:05,781
Okay.

174
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,160
Short but sweet.

175
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,953
She needs help.

176
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,167
I think I'm going to have the sea bass.

177
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,211
Sea bass, yeah. Sea bass is good.

178
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:24,674
Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass,
sea bass, sea bass, sea bass.

179
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:27,302
Sea bass...

180
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:29,596
Sea bass.

181
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,098
Jane?

182
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,766
Maybe you should stop
saying "sea bass"

183
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:33,892
and go after your friend.

184
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,019
This was so fun.

185
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,939
I'll just stay here
and say "sea bass" alone.

186
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:47,823
And I hate you.

187
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,575
What? I said he was cute.

188
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,702
Just shut up and drive.

189
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:02,838
You need to take the next left.

190
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,049
- Who's he?
- He's my intern.

191
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,385
- You have an intern?
- Oh, yeah.

192
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,512
Hello, Dr. Foster.

193
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,222
It's such a great honor
to be working with you.

194
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,850
Right. I have to call Erik.

195
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,309
Oh, take a right.

196
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:19,646
And a left.

197
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,693
I have totally mastered
driving in London.

198
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:28,321
Hi, Erik. It's me again. Where are you?

199
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,241
I came here because you said you were
onto something, and then you vanish.

200
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,909
I'm here at Stonehenge

201
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,246
for what has been an
interesting unfolding of events today.

202
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,081
<i>The police were called to the scene</i>

203
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,666
<i>shortly after 11 A.M. this morning</i>

204
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:43,170
<i>after a seemingly harmless rambler
approached the area</i>

205
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:46,047
<i>then, decided to strip naked
and effectively</i>

206
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,300
<i>terrorize tourists there
with scientific equipment</i>

207
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:51,303
<i>whilst shouting
that he was trying to save them.</i>

208
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:55,682
<i>The man, later identified
as noted astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig</i>

209
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,393
<i>has been called in
for questioning by police.</i>

210
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,439
Come on, this is exciting.

211
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,733
Look! The intern is excited.

212
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,067
"Ian."

213
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,652
Do you want the phase meter?

214
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,196
- No.
- Bring the phase meter.

215
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,156
The toaster-looking thing.

216
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:13,867
Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.

217
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,919
How do I change the ringtone
on this thing?

218
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,962
An astrophysicist with three degrees

219
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,797
should be able
to change her own ringtone.

220
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,382
Why are you calling me?

221
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,718
I didn't want to shout.
Intern says it's this way.

222
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,845
- "Ian." My name is Ian.
- Shh.

223
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,029
I am not getting stabbed
in the name of science.

224
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,656
It's okay, we're Americans.

225
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,699
Is that supposed to make them like us?

226
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,534
- They'll make it go away.
- Shh.

227
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,455
Oh, they're kids.

228
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:01,915
Are you the police?

229
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,252
No, we're scientists. Well, I am.

230
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:06,628
Thanks.

231
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,421
We just found it.

232
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:11,841
Can you show us?

233
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,829
That doesn't seem right.

234
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:58,888
Where'd it go?

235
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:13,445
That's...

236
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,113
That's incredible!

237
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,253
What happened?

238
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,796
Sometimes they come back.

239
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,506
Sometimes they don't.

240
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:37,677
I want to throw something!

241
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:38,928
Jane, give me your shoe.

242
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,725
I haven't seen readings like this since...

243
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,352
Since...

244
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:46,478
New Mexico?

245
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,942
Don't touch anything!

246
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,280
Give me your shoe.

247
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,120
Oh.

248
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,804
Were those the car keys?

249
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,667
Whoa. Ah!

250
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,170
Oh!

251
00:20:58,508 --> 00:20:59,509
Darcy!

252
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:47,724
Oh!

253
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,799
The Aether awakens us.

254
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:06,427
The convergence returns.

255
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,819
You're late.

256
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:27,156
Merriment can sometimes
be a heavier burden than battle.

257
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,825
Then you're doing
one of them incorrectly.

258
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,661
Perhaps.

259
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,663
How fare the stars?

260
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,498
Still shining.

261
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:38,459
From here, I can see
nine realms and ten trillion souls.

262
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:46,092
Do you recall
what I taught you of the Convergence?

263
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,343
Yes.

264
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,846
The alignment of the worlds.

265
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,723
It approaches, doesn't it?

266
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:55,852
The universe hasn't seen this marvel
since before my watch began.

267
00:23:56,894 --> 00:24:00,106
Few can sense it. Even fewer can see it.

268
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:04,068
But while its effects can be dangerous,

269
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,739
it is truly beautiful.

270
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:10,491
I see nothing.

271
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:14,203
Or, perhaps,
that is not the beauty you seek.

272
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,377
How is she?

273
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:23,463
She's quite clever,
your mortal.

274
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:24,839
She doesn't know it yet,

275
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,425
but she studies
the Convergence as well.

276
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:28,801
Even...

277
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:31,971
What?

278
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,225
I can't see her.

279
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,226
Jane!

280
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,103
Where the hell were you?

281
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,854
Tell me you didn't call the police.

282
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:23,064
What was I supposed to do?

283
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,982
- Not call the police.
- I was freaking out.

284
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,275
You call the cops, they call the Feds.

285
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,277
Next thing you know,
we have S.H.I.E.L.D. crawling all over

286
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:29,946
- "Area 51 -ing" the place.
- Jane.

287
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,115
We had a stable gravitation anomaly.

288
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,491
We had unimpeded access.

289
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:36,119
Our only competition was ten years old!

290
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,829
Jane! You were gone for five hours.

291
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:39,622
What?

292
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,131
That's weird.

293
00:26:09,694 --> 00:26:11,112
Typical.

294
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:12,905
Jane.

295
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:18,327
Sorry. I just needed
to make sure you were real.

296
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:19,996
It's been a very strange day.

297
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:21,664
I am. Jane, what...

298
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,124
Where were you?

299
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,333
Where were you?

300
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,586
Heimdall cannot see you.

301
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:28,504
I was right here where you left me.

302
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,840
I was waiting, and then I was crying

303
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,508
and then I went out looking for you.

304
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:34,218
You said you were coming back.

305
00:26:34,385 --> 00:26:36,721
I know. I know,
but the Bifrost was destroyed.

306
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:38,431
The Nine Realms erupted into chaos.

307
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:40,725
Wars were raging,
marauders were pillaging.

308
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:42,894
I had to put an end to the slaughter.

309
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:48,232
As excuses go, it's not terrible.

310
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:51,152
But I saw you on TV.
You were in New York!

311
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,781
Jane, I fought to protect you
from the dangers of my world

312
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:56,657
but I was wrong.

313
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,701
I was a fool.

314
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:03,039
But I believe
that fate brought us together.

315
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:08,169
Jane, I don't know where you were,
or what happened, but I do know this...

316
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,004
What?

317
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,298
I know...

318
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:14,634
You do?

319
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,220
Do what?

320
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:18,971
What?

321
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:20,556
Hey!

322
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:23,768
Is this you?

323
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,565
Uh, we're kind of
in the middle of something here.

324
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,652
Um, I'm pretty sure
we are getting arrested.

325
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:33,903
Hold that thought.

326
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:38,908
Look at you,
still all muscly and everything.

327
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,660
How's space?

328
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:42,870
Space is fine.

329
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,247
Excuse me.

330
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:45,498
- Are you Jane Foster?
- Yes.

331
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:46,582
Do you know this man?

332
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,252
He's my intern.

333
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,587
My intern's intern.

334
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,714
This is private property
and you're trespassing, the lot of you.

335
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:55,091
You'll have to come with me.

336
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:01,889
Jane.

337
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:04,642
- Jane.
- Thor?

338
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:05,977
Are you all right?

339
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,353
What just happened?

340
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:10,439
Place your hands
on your heads. Step back.

341
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:11,566
This woman is unwell.

342
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:12,650
She's dangerous.

343
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:14,986
So am I.

344
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:18,114
Requesting armed response officers
to scene.

345
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,116
- Hold on to me.
- What are you doing?

346
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,501
Holy shit.

347
00:28:57,987 --> 00:29:00,031
We have to do that again.

348
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:01,490
Hi.

349
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:06,495
Welcome to Asgard.

350
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,519
Look upon my legacy, Algrim.

351
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:34,732
I can barely remember a time
before the light.

352
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:38,653
Our survival will be your legacy.

353
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:44,283
The Asgardians will suffer
as we have suffered.

354
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:45,618
I will reclaim the Aether.

355
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:46,953
I will restore our world.

356
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:49,747
And I will put an end
to this poisoned universe.

357
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,048
What's that?

358
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,174
Be still.

359
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,101
This is not of Earth. What is it?

360
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:12,561
We do not know.

361
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:17,233
But she will not survive the
amount of energy surging within her.

362
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,407
That's a quantum field generator,
isn't it?

363
00:30:25,074 --> 00:30:26,909
It's a soul forge.

364
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:30,246
Does a soul forge transfer molecular
energy from one place to another?

365
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:34,166
Yes.

366
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,043
Quantum field generator.

367
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:40,089
My words are mere noises to you
that you ignore them completely?

368
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:41,382
She is ill.

369
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,759
She is mortal.

370
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:45,469
Illness is their defining trait.

371
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,221
I brought her here
because we can help her.

372
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:49,223
She does not belong here in Asgard

373
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,768
any more than a goat
belongs at a banquet table.

374
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,520
Did he just...

375
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,188
Who do you think you are?

376
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:58,816
I am Odin, King of Asgard.

377
00:30:58,983 --> 00:31:00,526
Protector of the Nine Realms.

378
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:03,279
Oh. Well, I'm...

379
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:06,282
I know very well who you are,
Jane Foster.

380
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:08,617
You told your dad about me?

381
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,953
Something is within her, Father.

382
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,246
Something I have not seen before.

383
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:13,622
Her world has its healers.

384
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:15,624
They are called "doctors."
Let them deal with it.

385
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,585
Guards, take her back to Midgard.

386
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,463
No, I would not...

387
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:23,382
...touch her.

388
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:24,800
Jane, are you all right?

389
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,469
Yeah.

390
00:31:30,181 --> 00:31:31,432
It's impossible.

391
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:35,394
The infection... It's defending her.

392
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,313
No.

393
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,482
It's defending itself.

394
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,526
Come with me.

395
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:46,447
There are relics
that pre-date the universe itself.

396
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:50,493
What lies within her
appears to be one of them.

397
00:31:51,494 --> 00:31:53,996
The Nine Realms are not eternal.

398
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:55,331
They had a dawn

399
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:56,665
as they will have a dusk.

400
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,001
But before that dawn

401
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:05,508
the dark forces, the Dark Elves,
reigned absolute and unchallenged.

402
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:08,761
"Born of eternal night

403
00:32:08,886 --> 00:32:11,722
"the Dark Elves come
to steal away the light."

404
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:15,601
I know these stories.
Mother told them to us as children.

405
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,938
Their leader Malekith made a weapon
out of that darkness

406
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:20,606
and it was called the Aether.

407
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,734
While the other relics
often appear as stones

408
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:26,487
the Aether is fluid and ever changing.

409
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:29,240
It changes matter into dark matter.

410
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:32,952
It seeks out host bodies,
drawing strength from their life-force.

411
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:37,164
Malekith sought to use
the Aether's power

412
00:32:37,331 --> 00:32:41,085
to return the universe
to one of darkness.

413
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:44,380
But, after eternities of bloodshed

414
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,049
my father Bor finally triumphed

415
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:51,720
ushering in a peace
that lasted thousands of years.

416
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:53,889
What happened?

417
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,101
He killed them all.

418
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:59,395
Are you certain?

419
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,480
The Aether was said to have
been destroyed with them,

420
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:02,815
and yet here it is.

421
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,402
The Dark Elves are dead.

422
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:10,531
Does your book happen to mention
how to get it out of me?

423
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:11,615
No.

424
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,243
It does not.

425
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:26,964
The worlds are nearly aligned.

426
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,138
You will be the last of the Kursed.

427
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:36,932
Let my life be sacrificed.

428
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:40,603
It is no less than our people did.

429
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,438
Or you have done.

430
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:52,198
You will become darkness.

431
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:57,119
cursed to this existence
until it consumes you.

432
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:06,253
Until then, no power our enemies
possess can stop you.

433
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:16,138
I will tear down their defenses and
ensure your return to a universe reborn.

434
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:41,372
Acting as caretakers to these
scoundrels is beneath us.

435
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,624
Oh, please!
If they were beneath you,

436
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,834
my rotund friend, they'd all be dead.

437
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:02,518
- Keep in line!
- Move it!

438
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,690
Odin continues to
bring me new friends.

439
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:09,817
How thoughtful.

440
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:13,529
The books I sent,
do they not interest you?

441
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:17,324
Is that how I am to while away eternity?
Reading?

442
00:35:17,408 --> 00:35:20,536
I've done everything in my power
to make you comfortable, Loki.

443
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,662
Have you?

444
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:24,540
Does Odin share your concern?

445
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,543
Does Thor?

446
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:31,338
It must be so inconvenient,
them asking after me day and night.

447
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:34,550
You know full well it was your actions
that brought you here.

448
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,427
My actions?

449
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,847
I was merely giving truth to the lie
that I had been fed my entire life...

450
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,598
That I was born to be a king.

451
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:43,642
A king?

452
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:45,728
A true king admits his faults.

453
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:47,271
What of the lives you took on Earth?

454
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:49,023
A mere handful
compared to the number

455
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:50,899
that Odin has taken himself.

456
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:53,736
- Your father...
- He's not my father!

457
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,824
Then am I not your mother?

458
00:36:04,038 --> 00:36:05,998
You're not.

459
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:14,757
You're always so perceptive
about everyone but yourself.

460
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:33,108
When you came for me,
you knew I was in trouble.

461
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,485
Heimdall had lost sight of you.

462
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,278
You were no longer on Earth.

463
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:37,738
How is that possible?

464
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,907
I believe you were and you weren't.

465
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:42,868
The Nine Realms
travel within Yggdrasil

466
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,413
orbiting Midgard much the way
your planets orbit the sun.

467
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,709
And every 5,000 years,
the worlds align perfectly

468
00:36:50,793 --> 00:36:53,003
and we call this the Convergence.

469
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,801
During this time, the borders
between worlds become blurred.

470
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:02,262
It's possible
you found one of these points.

471
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,517
We are lucky that it remained open.

472
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:10,938
Once the worlds pass out of alignment

473
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:14,400
then the connection is lost.

474
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,540
I like the way you explain things.

475
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:33,210
What's going to happen to me?

476
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:34,962
I'll find a way to save you, Jane.

477
00:37:35,129 --> 00:37:38,298
- Your father said there was...
- My father doesn't know everything.

478
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:40,175
Don't let him hear you say that.

479
00:37:41,552 --> 00:37:42,845
Jane Foster...

480
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,263
Please meet Frigga,

481
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:46,265
Queen of Asgard, and my mother.

482
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,477
Hi.

483
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,028
Move!

484
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:28,867
To the dungeons!

485
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:30,244
Come on!

486
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,478
You might want to take
the stairs to the left.

487
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:08,865
The prisons.

488
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,826
- Loki...
- Go.

489
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:12,828
I will look after her.

490
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,799
It's as if they resent being imprisoned!

491
00:40:29,845 --> 00:40:32,681
There's no pleasing some creatures.

492
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:42,816
Return to your cells,
no further harm will come to you.

493
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:44,192
You have my word.

494
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:48,363
Very well, you do not have my word.

495
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:00,250
Send a squadron
to the weapons vault.

496
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,919
Defend it at all costs.
Secure the dungeon.

497
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,671
- Odin.
- Frigga.

498
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:06,548
Go!

499
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:08,592
It's a skirmish.

500
00:41:08,717 --> 00:41:09,885
Nothing to fear.

501
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,470
You've never been a very good liar.

502
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:13,472
Take her to your chambers.

503
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:15,432
I'll come for you when it's safe.

504
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:17,059
You take care.

505
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:18,143
Despite all I have survived,

506
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:21,772
my queen still worries over me.

507
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,106
It's only because I worry over you

508
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,067
that you have survived.

509
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:28,779
Listen to me now.

510
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,907
I need you to do everything I ask,
no questions.

511
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:33,200
Yes, ma'am.

512
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:15,409
Oh!

513
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:47,162
- Ow!
- Ah!

514
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:45,887
The throne of Asgard
is destroyed! To the king!

515
00:47:01,695 --> 00:47:02,696
Frigga.

516
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,915
Stand down, creature,

517
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:15,709
and you may still survive this.

518
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:17,877
I have survived worse, woman.

519
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:20,714
Who are you?

520
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:23,299
I am Malekith.

521
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:26,094
And I would have what is mine.

522
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,357
Ah!

523
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,918
You have taken something, child.

524
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:01,004
Give it back.

525
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:16,478
Witch!

526
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:21,691
Where is the Aether?

527
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:24,110
I'll never tell you.

528
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,321
I believe you.

529
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,992
No!

530
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,909
<i>The universe rotates
on a 5,000-year cycle</i>

531
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:03,162
and once a cycle, all the worlds align.

532
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:06,749
Imagine... Imagine that this is our world.

533
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,544
Oh, thank you. And this is another world.

534
00:52:09,711 --> 00:52:11,671
Normally, they're separate.

535
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:13,548
But during the Alignment,

536
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:17,176
everything is connected,
all nine realms.

537
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,512
All nine realms
are passing through each other

538
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:21,931
and gravity, light, and even matter,

539
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:24,642
is crashing from one world to the other.

540
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:30,898
But if this happens to us now,
the result will be cataclysmic.

541
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:35,486
My gravimetric spikes can stabilize
the focal point of the Convergence.

542
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,489
This time, the Alignment

543
00:52:38,573 --> 00:52:41,576
and all the other worlds
would just pass us by.

544
00:52:41,743 --> 00:52:43,244
It's beautiful.

545
00:52:44,746 --> 00:52:46,914
It's simple. Any questions?

546
00:52:50,043 --> 00:52:51,085
Yeah.

547
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:54,255
Can I have my shoe back?

548
00:53:02,013 --> 00:53:06,017
Heal. You will need your strength
to reclaim the Aether.

549
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:10,104
And when you wake,
we will kill them all.

550
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:46,974
Jane Foster?

551
00:53:48,643 --> 00:53:50,812
You need to come with us.

552
00:53:52,063 --> 00:53:55,149
We are still unable to restore
the palace shields.

553
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:56,692
Our artillery cannot detect them.

554
00:53:56,818 --> 00:53:58,611
Even Heimdall cannot see them.

555
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:05,910
My king, we are all but defenseless.

556
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:09,956
She's your prisoner now?

557
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:13,668
Leave us.

558
00:54:22,677 --> 00:54:24,846
I do not wish to fight with you.

559
00:54:25,346 --> 00:54:27,098
Nor I with you.

560
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,016
But I intend to pursue Malekith.

561
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:30,476
We possess the Aether.

562
00:54:31,144 --> 00:54:32,353
Malekith will come to us.

563
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,522
Yes, and he will destroy us.

564
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,732
You overestimate
the power of these creatures.

565
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:39,193
No, I value our people's lives.

566
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:42,655
I'll take Jane to the Dark World,
and draw the enemy away from Asgard.

567
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:45,616
When Malekith
pulls the Aether from Jane,

568
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,702
it will be exposed and vulnerable.

569
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:49,662
And I will destroy it and him.

570
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:54,459
If you fail, you risk this weapon

571
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:56,377
falling into the hands of our enemies.

572
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:58,880
The risk is far greater if we do nothing.

573
00:54:59,005 --> 00:55:00,965
His ship could be over our heads
right now,

574
00:55:01,174 --> 00:55:02,383
we would never even know it.

575
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:03,718
If and when he comes

576
00:55:03,801 --> 00:55:07,972
his men will fall
on 10,000 Asgardian blades.

577
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,474
And how many of our men
shall fall on theirs?

578
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,559
As many as are needed!

579
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:15,730
Ah!

580
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:22,069
We will fight!

581
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:27,116
Till the last Asgardian breath.

582
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:30,953
Till the last drop of Asgardian blood.

583
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,209
Then how are you different
from Malekith?

584
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:42,006
The difference, my son, is that I will win.

585
00:55:56,312 --> 00:55:59,106
Jane isn't calling me back,
Erik isn't calling me back,

586
00:55:59,232 --> 00:56:01,150
stupid S.H.I.E.L.D.
isn't calling me back.

587
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,110
- What's S.H.I.E.L.D?
- It's a secret.

588
00:56:03,194 --> 00:56:05,112
Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.

589
00:56:05,238 --> 00:56:08,032
Thor came back,
he took Jane to Asgard,

590
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:11,744
and I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do.

591
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,746
<i>Something else
went missing this week</i>

592
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:16,958
<i>when astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig</i>

593
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:20,628
<i>notable for his involvement
in the alien invasion of New York</i>

594
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:22,088
<i>streaked nude across...</i>

595
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:24,799
Darcy,
you really need to look at this.

596
00:56:24,966 --> 00:56:26,133
Your friend, Erik...

597
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:27,969
What was his last name again?

598
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:32,306
<i>And began shouting at visitors
to the historic site.</i>

599
00:56:32,473 --> 00:56:34,517
<i>He was later taken into police custody</i>

600
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,436
<i>for psychiatric evaluation.</i>

601
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:39,647
<i>Police are still refusing to confirm...</i>

602
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,201
You were not at Odin's war council.

603
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:54,662
The Bifrost is closed
by your father's orders.

604
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,163
No one is to come

605
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:57,540
or to go.

606
00:56:59,625 --> 00:57:02,336
We face an enemy
that is invisible even to me.

607
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:06,215
What use is a guardian such as that?

608
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:10,428
Malekith will return, you know this.

609
00:57:12,972 --> 00:57:14,015
I need your help.

610
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,227
I cannot overrule my king's wishes.
Not even for you.

611
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:19,979
I'm not asking you to.

612
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,523
The realms need their Allfather strong
and unchallenged

613
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:25,234
whether he is or not.

614
00:57:25,401 --> 00:57:27,111
But he is blinded, Heimdall

615
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:28,946
by hatred and by grief.

616
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:30,698
As are we all.

617
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:31,991
I see clearly enough.

618
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:33,701
The risks are too great.

619
00:57:33,993 --> 00:57:36,704
Everything we do from here on is a risk.

620
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:38,581
There is no other way.

621
00:57:42,543 --> 00:57:44,754
What do you require of me?

622
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:48,424
<i>What I'm about to ask of you
is treason of the highest order.</i>

623
00:57:48,716 --> 00:57:52,762
<i>Success will bring us exile
and failure shall mean our death.</i>

624
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:59,727
<i>Malekith knew the Aether was here.
He can sense its power.</i>

625
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:02,438
<i>If we do nothing,
he will come for it again</i>

626
00:58:02,605 --> 00:58:06,734
<i>but this time, lay waste to all of Asgard.</i>

627
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:09,737
We must move Jane off-world.

628
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:11,572
The Bifrost has been shut down

629
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,407
and the Tesseract
locked away in the vault.

630
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:17,703
There are other paths off Asgard.
Ways known only to a few.

631
00:58:17,787 --> 00:58:19,705
One, actually.

632
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:23,542
No.

633
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:31,175
Thor. After all this time

634
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:33,928
and now you come to visit me.

635
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,430
Why?

636
00:58:37,765 --> 00:58:40,810
Have you come to gloat? To mock?

637
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:42,561
Loki, enough.

638
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:44,814
No more illusions.

639
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,073
Now you see me, brother.

640
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,500
Did she suffer?

641
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,961
I did not come here to share our grief.

642
00:59:07,086 --> 00:59:10,172
Instead I offer you the chance
of a far richer sacrament.

643
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:12,800
Go on.

644
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:15,636
I know you seek vengeance
as much as I do.

645
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,681
You help me escape Asgard
and I will grant it to you.

646
00:59:18,973 --> 00:59:20,349
Vengeance

647
00:59:20,516 --> 00:59:22,935
and afterward, this cell.

648
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:34,488
You must be truly desperate
to come to me for help.

649
00:59:36,157 --> 00:59:37,742
What makes you think
you can trust me?

650
00:59:37,825 --> 00:59:39,243
I don't.

651
00:59:40,953 --> 00:59:42,037
Mother did.

652
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,833
But you should know that when
we fought each other in the past,

653
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:48,127
I did so with a glimmer of hope

654
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,087
that my brother
was still in there somewhere.

655
00:59:51,714 --> 00:59:54,175
That hope no longer exists
to protect you.

656
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:58,387
You betray me, and I will kill you.

657
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,391
Hmm.

658
01:00:03,893 --> 01:00:05,603
When do we start?

659
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:07,021
He will betray you.

660
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,731
He will try.

661
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:15,696
This is so unlike you, brother.

662
01:00:15,863 --> 01:00:17,865
So clandestine.

663
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:20,201
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather just punch your way out?

664
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:22,870
If you keep speaking, I just might.

665
01:00:22,995 --> 01:00:24,830
Fine. As you wish.

666
01:00:25,206 --> 01:00:26,373
I'm not even here.

667
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,210
Is this better?

668
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:31,879
It's better company at least.

669
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:35,925
Still, we could be less conspicuous.

670
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:39,845
Mmm, brother, you look ravishing.

671
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:44,391
It will hurt no less
when I kill you in this form.

672
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:47,728
Very well. Perhaps you
prefer one of your new companions

673
01:00:47,895 --> 01:00:49,939
given that you seem
to like them so much.

674
01:00:50,523 --> 01:00:52,525
Oh, this is much better.

675
01:00:52,608 --> 01:00:53,609
Ooh.

676
01:00:53,943 --> 01:00:56,570
The costume is a bit much. So tight.

677
01:00:56,737 --> 01:00:58,030
But the confidence...

678
01:00:58,197 --> 01:01:00,616
I can feel the righteousness surging.

679
01:01:00,783 --> 01:01:03,244
Hey, do you want to have
a rousing discussion about truth?

680
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:04,912
Honor? Patriotism?

681
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:05,996
God bless Amer...

682
01:01:08,707 --> 01:01:10,042
What?

683
01:01:14,547 --> 01:01:16,924
You could at least
furnish me with a weapon.

684
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:18,968
My dagger, something.

685
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:25,724
At last.

686
01:01:25,808 --> 01:01:27,518
A little common sense.

687
01:01:33,649 --> 01:01:36,193
And I thought you liked tricks.

688
01:01:36,277 --> 01:01:40,823
Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is
being guarded by a legion of Einherjar

689
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:42,741
who will see you coming
from miles away.

690
01:01:42,825 --> 01:01:44,535
I won't be the one who comes for her.

691
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:53,335
I'm not hungry.

692
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:55,880
What the...

693
01:01:55,963 --> 01:01:58,215
Good. Let's go.

694
01:02:03,596 --> 01:02:04,638
You're...

695
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:06,765
I'm Loki, you may have heard of me.

696
01:02:06,849 --> 01:02:09,393
That was for New York.

697
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:10,853
I like her.

698
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:12,646
<i>And what of the Allfather?</i>

699
01:02:13,314 --> 01:02:17,026
It is my sworn duty to notify him
of crimes against the throne.

700
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:20,779
You called me here on an urgent matter.

701
01:02:21,822 --> 01:02:22,823
What is it?

702
01:02:23,282 --> 01:02:24,575
Treason, my lord.

703
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:25,993
Whose?

704
01:02:26,702 --> 01:02:27,745
Mine.

705
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:29,997
My king!

706
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,082
The mortal has been taken.

707
01:02:35,961 --> 01:02:36,962
Stop Thor.

708
01:02:37,046 --> 01:02:39,173
By any means necessary.

709
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:44,386
There they are! Take them.

710
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:45,471
On my command.

711
01:02:45,554 --> 01:02:47,765
I'll hold them off. Take her.

712
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:49,808
Thank you.

713
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:54,772
Betray him, and I'll kill you.

714
01:02:57,024 --> 01:02:59,610
It's good to see you, too, Sif.

715
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:09,536
Assuming you can get Loki's help
and you can free this mortal

716
01:03:09,662 --> 01:03:11,163
what good would it do?

717
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:14,124
We'd all be dead the minute
we step one foot outside the palace.

718
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:17,419
That, my friend,
is why we won't be leaving by foot.

719
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,300
I will give you as much time as I can.

720
01:03:23,384 --> 01:03:25,219
Thank you, my friend.

721
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:32,559
If you even think about betraying him...

722
01:03:32,685 --> 01:03:34,311
You'll kill me?

723
01:03:34,395 --> 01:03:36,397
Evidently, there will be a line.

724
01:03:51,704 --> 01:03:53,789
I thought you said
you knew how to fly this thing.

725
01:03:53,956 --> 01:03:55,749
I said, "How hard could it be?"

726
01:03:59,128 --> 01:04:00,129
They're on the ship!

727
01:04:00,963 --> 01:04:02,256
Get to the ship!

728
01:04:05,968 --> 01:04:08,554
Well, whatever you're doing, brother,
I suggest you do it faster.

729
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:11,015
Shut up, Loki.

730
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:13,267
You must have missed something.

731
01:04:13,392 --> 01:04:16,103
No, I didn't.
I'm pressing every button on this thing.

732
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:17,771
No, don't hit it. Just press it gently.

733
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:19,732
I'm pressing it gently, it's not working!

734
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:23,861
Ha, ha!

735
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:29,074
Get him! Get him!

736
01:04:57,644 --> 01:05:00,147
- I think you missed a column.
- Shut up!

737
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:08,655
Look,
why don't you let me take over?

738
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:09,990
I'm clearly the better pilot.

739
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:12,201
Is that right? Well, out of the two of us,

740
01:05:12,326 --> 01:05:13,827
which one can actually fly?

741
01:05:24,338 --> 01:05:25,923
Oh, dear. Is she dead?

742
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:27,007
Jane.

743
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,801
I'm okay.

744
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:31,929
Ah!

745
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:37,267
Not a word.

746
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:40,771
Now they're following us.

747
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:47,277
Now they're firing at us.

748
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:48,779
Yeah, thank you
for the commentary, Loki,

749
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,197
it's not at all distracting!

750
01:05:54,743 --> 01:05:57,371
Well done.
You just decapitated your grandfather.

751
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,134
You know, this is wonderful.

752
01:06:10,259 --> 01:06:12,553
This is a tremendous idea.

753
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,806
Let's steal the biggest,
most obvious ship in the universe

754
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:17,224
and escape in that.

755
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:18,475
Flying around the city,

756
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,936
smashing into everything in sight
so everyone can see us.

757
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:22,771
It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant!

758
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:38,912
I see your time in the dungeons

759
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:41,582
has made you no less graceful, Loki.

760
01:06:45,794 --> 01:06:47,754
You lied to me.

761
01:06:49,006 --> 01:06:50,382
I'm impressed.

762
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:51,925
I'm glad you're pleased.

763
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:53,010
Now, do as you promised.

764
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:54,928
And take us to your secret pathway.

765
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,703
- Fandral.
- Right.

766
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:24,416
For Asgard.

767
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:31,131
Nothing personal, boys.

768
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:47,814
Loki...

769
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:51,235
If it were easy, everyone would do it.

770
01:07:51,318 --> 01:07:53,320
- Are you mad?
- Possibly.

771
01:08:08,919 --> 01:08:10,504
Ta-da!

772
01:08:16,051 --> 01:08:19,388
We must strike now.

773
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,431
No.

774
01:08:23,058 --> 01:08:28,689
Asgard is meaningless.

775
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:34,820
The Aether has found its way home.

776
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:54,089
What I could do with the power
that flows through those veins.

777
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,842
It would consume you.

778
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,386
She's holding up all right.

779
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:01,346
For now.

780
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:04,433
She's strong in ways
you'd never even know.

781
01:09:04,558 --> 01:09:05,892
Say goodbye.

782
01:09:05,976 --> 01:09:07,769
Not this day.

783
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:10,689
This day, the next,
a hundred years, it's nothing.

784
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,483
It's a heartbeat.

785
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,902
You'll never be ready.

786
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,821
The only woman
whose love you've prized

787
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,698
will be snatched from you.

788
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:21,074
And will that satisfy you?

789
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,743
Satisfaction is not in my nature.

790
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:25,037
Surrender is not in mine.

791
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,331
- The son of Odin...
- No.

792
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:29,458
Not just of Odin.

793
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:31,918
You think you alone
were loved of Mother?

794
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:34,087
You had her tricks, but I had her trust.

795
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:35,505
Trust?

796
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:37,924
Was that her last expression?

797
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:40,761
Trust? When you let her die?

798
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:43,597
- What help were you in your cell?
- Who put me there?

799
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,098
Who put me there?

800
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:46,224
You know damn well!

801
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,685
You know damn well who!

802
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,611
She wouldn't want us to fight.

803
01:09:58,737 --> 01:10:01,281
Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.

804
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:08,497
I wish I could trust you.

805
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:24,971
Trust my rage.

806
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:34,523
You'll have to sign
for your father's belongings, Mr. Selvig.

807
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:36,358
What?

808
01:10:36,483 --> 01:10:37,818
Oh, yeah.

809
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:40,904
My father, Dr. Erik Selvig.

810
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:44,991
One man's leather wallet, brown.

811
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:47,536
One key ring, three keys.

812
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:49,579
Prescription medicine...

813
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:51,581
Various.

814
01:10:54,251 --> 01:10:56,002
- And...
- Erik.

815
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,005
- These.
- Yeah.

816
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:00,298
Those.

817
01:11:00,799 --> 01:11:02,092
Thank goodness.

818
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,970
Erik.

819
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:07,889
Yes?

820
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,683
It's, uh, Darcy.

821
01:11:09,808 --> 01:11:10,892
Darcy.

822
01:11:13,103 --> 01:11:14,896
So good to see you.

823
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,064
Oh, I missed you, too.

824
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:17,607
How did you find me?

825
01:11:17,691 --> 01:11:18,942
You were naked on TV.

826
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:22,446
Okay, time to go, lots to do.

827
01:11:24,531 --> 01:11:26,533
Getting weird now.

828
01:11:27,951 --> 01:11:30,078
I should not be left in charge
of stuff like this.

829
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:34,040
I don't get paid enough.
I don't get paid, period.

830
01:11:34,124 --> 01:11:37,127
I'm Ian by the way, uh, Darcy's intern.

831
01:11:37,294 --> 01:11:39,463
Yeah, I don't get paid either.

832
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:41,798
Are you all right?

833
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:43,800
I've had a god in my brain.

834
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:46,595
I don't recommend it.

835
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:50,515
Dr. Selvig, sir,
your gear is beeping at me.

836
01:11:50,599 --> 01:11:52,976
It's happening.
It's sooner than I calculated.

837
01:11:53,143 --> 01:11:54,769
Wait. What's happening?

838
01:11:58,064 --> 01:11:59,733
Birds?

839
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:01,234
Birds are happening?

840
01:12:01,318 --> 01:12:03,570
They're starlings.
It's called a murmuration.

841
01:12:03,737 --> 01:12:05,906
My dad, he used to take me
bird watching as a kid.

842
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,574
- Nerd.
- Look!

843
01:12:12,162 --> 01:12:14,331
Where did they go?

844
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,429
What the hell was that?

845
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:31,598
Why are you smiling?

846
01:12:31,765 --> 01:12:32,974
There's nothing more reassuring

847
01:12:33,058 --> 01:12:36,770
than realizing that the world
is crazier than you are.

848
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:39,731
Take me to Jane's lab.

849
01:12:52,202 --> 01:12:53,662
Jane.

850
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:01,628
Malekith.

851
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,819
All right. Are you ready?

852
01:13:25,986 --> 01:13:27,237
I am.

853
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,877
You know, this plan of yours
is going to get us killed.

854
01:13:43,003 --> 01:13:44,879
Yes, possibly.

855
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:49,718
You still don't trust me, brother?

856
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:52,637
Would you?

857
01:14:01,563 --> 01:14:02,772
No, I wouldn't.

858
01:14:07,569 --> 01:14:09,029
Thor!

859
01:14:09,863 --> 01:14:11,448
No!

860
01:14:20,749 --> 01:14:23,209
You really think I cared about Frigga?

861
01:14:23,293 --> 01:14:25,003
About any of you?

862
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:29,007
All I ever wanted

863
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:31,551
was you and Odin

864
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:32,761
dead at my feet!

865
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:46,399
Malekith!

866
01:14:48,485 --> 01:14:50,487
I am Loki of Jotunheim,

867
01:14:50,654 --> 01:14:52,572
and I bring you a gift.

868
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:56,368
I ask only one thing in return...

869
01:14:56,451 --> 01:14:58,244
A good seat from which

870
01:14:58,328 --> 01:14:59,871
to watch Asgard burn.

871
01:15:00,497 --> 01:15:02,749
He is an enemy of Asgard.

872
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:05,585
He was a prisoner in their dungeons.

873
01:15:19,808 --> 01:15:20,934
Look at me.

874
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:20,452
Loki! Now!

875
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:42,075
Ah!

876
01:18:36,296 --> 01:18:37,297
Ah!

877
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:36,898
- Ah!
- No!

878
01:19:46,157 --> 01:19:48,284
See you in hell, monster.

879
01:20:07,136 --> 01:20:08,596
No. No, no, no.

880
01:20:10,932 --> 01:20:13,184
Oh, you fool, you didn't listen.

881
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:14,268
I know...

882
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:17,480
I'm a fool, I'm a fool.

883
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:18,731
Stay with me, okay?

884
01:20:18,815 --> 01:20:19,983
I'm sorry.

885
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:24,237
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Shh...

886
01:20:24,362 --> 01:20:25,655
It's okay.

887
01:20:29,283 --> 01:20:30,785
It's all right.

888
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:34,414
I'll tell Father what you did here today.

889
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:40,420
I didn't do it for him.

890
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:51,347
No!

891
01:21:45,151 --> 01:21:47,195
He's going to unleash it.

892
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:52,492
Not just on Asgard, or on a star.
Malekith is going to destroy everything.

893
01:21:52,617 --> 01:21:53,743
How?

894
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:55,995
Jane, how?

895
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:59,332
I saw him on Earth.
Why would he go to Earth?

896
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:01,292
The Convergence.

897
01:22:01,459 --> 01:22:02,627
Oh, God.

898
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:04,712
None of this would have happened
if I hadn't found the Aether.

899
01:22:05,922 --> 01:22:07,673
Then Malekith
would've only possessed it

900
01:22:07,799 --> 01:22:09,467
that much sooner.

901
01:22:09,550 --> 01:22:12,011
I only found it
because I was looking for you.

902
01:22:12,637 --> 01:22:13,888
Jane...

903
01:22:15,515 --> 01:22:17,225
Now we're trapped here.

904
01:22:23,773 --> 01:22:24,982
It's not me.

905
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:27,485
Hello?

906
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:28,820
<i>Hi, Jane, it's Richard.</i>

907
01:22:28,986 --> 01:22:30,738
Richard? Where are you?

908
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:32,073
I'm still at the office.

909
01:22:32,198 --> 01:22:34,158
It's been a crazy day here today.

910
01:22:34,242 --> 01:22:36,160
- Oh, my God, this is amazing.
- <i>Is it?</i>

911
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:37,495
<i>I quite enjoyed our lunch</i>

912
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:39,664
despite never actually
ordering anything.

913
01:22:39,747 --> 01:22:41,165
How am I getting service here?

914
01:22:41,249 --> 01:22:43,376
<i>Is this a bad time?
Do you want me to try you later?</i>

915
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:46,671
No, no, no. Please, whatever
you do, do not hang up the phone.

916
01:22:47,547 --> 01:22:48,673
Okay, then.

917
01:22:48,756 --> 01:22:51,134
<i>I was just wondering
if you want to try again.</i>

918
01:22:51,217 --> 01:22:52,677
<i>Uh, maybe dinner next time.</i>

919
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:54,387
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

920
01:22:54,512 --> 01:22:56,764
- <i>Just stay on the phone, okay?</i>
- Yeah, I will.

921
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:58,850
Oh, my God.

922
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:03,813
Am I interrupting something?

923
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:05,606
No, no, no. Nothing at all.

924
01:23:05,773 --> 01:23:06,774
Come on.

925
01:23:06,858 --> 01:23:07,942
<i>I'm losing you there.
Are you in a tunnel?</i>

926
01:23:08,109 --> 01:23:09,527
Where are we going?

927
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:10,611
<i>Hello?</i>

928
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:12,572
Why are there so many shoes in here?

929
01:23:14,157 --> 01:23:15,992
I'll just text her.

930
01:23:28,296 --> 01:23:29,463
So, who's Richard?

931
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:31,090
Really?

932
01:23:39,432 --> 01:23:40,892
- Jane!
- Hey.

933
01:23:40,975 --> 01:23:42,727
You can't just leave like that.

934
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:44,103
The whole world is going crazy.

935
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:46,105
All the stuff we saw is spreading.

936
01:23:47,607 --> 01:23:49,442
- Did you go to a party?
- Erik?

937
01:23:49,567 --> 01:23:53,237
Jane! How wonderful.

938
01:23:54,113 --> 01:23:55,156
Oh!

939
01:23:55,448 --> 01:23:57,283
- You've been to Asgard.
- Where are your pants?

940
01:23:57,408 --> 01:23:59,160
Oh, he, uh...
He says it helps him think.

941
01:23:59,285 --> 01:24:00,870
Okay, well, I'm going to need
everything you got on this.

942
01:24:00,953 --> 01:24:03,664
All the work you've been doing
on gravimetric anomalies, everything.

943
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:04,957
Okay.

944
01:24:05,041 --> 01:24:07,126
Are you well, Erik?

945
01:24:07,585 --> 01:24:09,086
Your brother's not coming, is he?

946
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:11,422
Loki is dead.

947
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:12,590
Oh, thank God!

948
01:24:13,758 --> 01:24:15,968
I... I meant, I'm so sorry.

949
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:17,637
Thank you.

950
01:24:41,244 --> 01:24:43,120
Forgive me, my liege.

951
01:24:43,955 --> 01:24:46,457
I've returned from
the Dark World with news.

952
01:24:48,918 --> 01:24:50,002
Thor?

953
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:55,091
There was no sign of Thor,
or the weapon, but...

954
01:24:56,926 --> 01:24:58,135
What?

955
01:25:01,097 --> 01:25:02,723
We found a body.

956
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:08,562
Loki.

957
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:14,485
Malekith is going to
fire the Aether at a spot

958
01:25:14,652 --> 01:25:16,570
where all the nine worlds
are connecting.

959
01:25:16,696 --> 01:25:19,156
Amplifying the weapon's impact.

960
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,658
For each additional world,

961
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:22,868
the power will increase exponentially.

962
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:26,038
The effect would be universal.

963
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:27,790
But the Alignment is only temporary.

964
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:30,918
He must be in
exactly the right place at the right time.

965
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:32,712
Well, how do we know where that is?

966
01:25:33,921 --> 01:25:36,340
We follow the directions.

967
01:25:36,507 --> 01:25:37,758
This has happened before

968
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:41,220
thousands of years ago,
and the Ancients were there to see it.

969
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:43,264
All the great constructions,

970
01:25:44,098 --> 01:25:46,809
the Mayans, the Chinese,
the Egyptians.

971
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:50,313
They made use of the gravitational
effects of the Convergence.

972
01:25:50,396 --> 01:25:52,481
And they left us a map.

973
01:25:52,565 --> 01:25:53,983
Stonehenge,

974
01:25:55,443 --> 01:25:56,485
Snowdon,

975
01:25:56,569 --> 01:25:57,737
the Great Orme.

976
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:59,697
These are all coordinates taking us...

977
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:02,074
Here.

978
01:26:04,577 --> 01:26:06,037
Greenwich?

979
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:08,748
The walls between worlds
will be almost non-existent.

980
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:10,207
Physics is going to go ballistic.

981
01:26:10,291 --> 01:26:12,126
Increases and decreases in gravity,

982
01:26:12,251 --> 01:26:13,711
spatial extrusions.

983
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:16,422
The very fabric of reality
is going to be torn apart.

984
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:21,927
I better get my pants.

985
01:26:23,512 --> 01:26:24,847
Focus! This is important.

986
01:26:25,014 --> 01:26:26,474
We have to hammer them in
all around the site

987
01:26:26,599 --> 01:26:28,893
and then Jane and Erik
will activate them from the tower.

988
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:30,686
They're taped together.

989
01:26:30,895 --> 01:26:33,189
Do you even know
what these things do?

990
01:26:33,564 --> 01:26:35,191
Uh... No.

991
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:36,525
Neither do I.

992
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:42,615
Shh!

993
01:26:45,326 --> 01:26:47,328
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Right.

994
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:01,133
Holy...

995
01:27:01,258 --> 01:27:02,259
Shit.

996
01:27:14,772 --> 01:27:15,773
Ah!

997
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:23,090
You needn't have come
so far, Asgardian.

998
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:25,426
Death would've come to you
soon enough.

999
01:28:25,551 --> 01:28:27,052
Not by your hand.

1000
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:29,889
Your universe was never meant to be.

1001
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:33,058
Your world and your family

1002
01:28:33,142 --> 01:28:35,269
will be extinguished!

1003
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:38,898
We're running out of time.

1004
01:28:39,023 --> 01:28:41,358
- Almost there.
- Are you sure this is going to work?

1005
01:28:41,442 --> 01:28:44,028
These devices were made
to detect anomalies, not cause them.

1006
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:46,155
Oh, come on.

1007
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:53,537
Come on, Darcy.

1008
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:05,925
You know, with all that power,

1009
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:07,551
I thought you'd hit harder.

1010
01:29:32,952 --> 01:29:34,036
Done.

1011
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,671
The Convergence
will be in full effect in seven minutes.

1012
01:29:43,796 --> 01:29:45,965
That just means we have to
keep Malekith busy for eight.

1013
01:29:52,471 --> 01:29:54,348
Okay, you might want to
hold on to something.

1014
01:30:00,020 --> 01:30:01,397
That is awesome!

1015
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:02,982
<i>How did you do that?</i>

1016
01:30:03,065 --> 01:30:04,358
Well, the gravitational fields

1017
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:06,735
interact with the weak spots
between worlds, creating...

1018
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:08,237
Ooh, get the guy with the sword!

1019
01:30:11,657 --> 01:30:13,534
- Oops.
- Let's go.

1020
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:15,077
Um...

1021
01:30:15,494 --> 01:30:17,162
What the hell just happened?

1022
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:18,956
Move!

1023
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:38,058
What are you all doing?

1024
01:30:38,183 --> 01:30:39,852
You need to get out of here, now!

1025
01:30:39,977 --> 01:30:41,520
You're joking, right?

1026
01:30:41,645 --> 01:30:42,605
That's Thor out there.

1027
01:30:42,688 --> 01:30:44,815
He's waving his hammer around
and everything!

1028
01:31:43,624 --> 01:31:45,125
Ah!

1029
01:32:03,185 --> 01:32:04,687
<i>Confirming ship is hostile.</i>

1030
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:06,730
<i>Confirmed, ship is hostile.</i>

1031
01:32:06,814 --> 01:32:08,232
<i>You have permission to engage.</i>

1032
01:32:08,315 --> 01:32:09,525
<i>Roger.</i>

1033
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:10,734
<i>Missiles locked.</i>

1034
01:32:11,568 --> 01:32:13,320
<i>Missiles away.</i>

1035
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:15,948
<i>Missiles off target.</i>

1036
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:18,742
<i>I repeat, target missed.
I'm losing control.</i>

1037
01:32:18,826 --> 01:32:21,620
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Lost positive control.</i>

1038
01:32:23,747 --> 01:32:24,748
What are you doing?

1039
01:32:24,832 --> 01:32:26,333
My signal's not connecting.

1040
01:32:28,627 --> 01:32:29,628
Jane!

1041
01:32:29,712 --> 01:32:30,796
Come on.

1042
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,381
Are you all right?

1043
01:33:14,548 --> 01:33:15,549
You saved my life.

1044
01:33:19,178 --> 01:33:20,179
Yeah.

1045
01:33:20,262 --> 01:33:21,555
I guess I did.

1046
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:30,355
Mmm.

1047
01:33:30,731 --> 01:33:31,732
Darcy?

1048
01:33:32,065 --> 01:33:33,066
Jane!

1049
01:33:33,150 --> 01:33:35,486
- Ian!
- Selvig!

1050
01:33:36,028 --> 01:33:37,196
Mew mew!

1051
01:33:40,824 --> 01:33:42,701
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

1052
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:45,954
How do I get to Greenwich?

1053
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:49,041
Take this train. Three stops.

1054
01:33:51,126 --> 01:33:53,629
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

1055
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:57,508
Sorry. Sorry.

1056
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:36,672
- We're out of time.
- Jane.

1057
01:34:37,798 --> 01:34:38,924
Jane!

1058
01:35:04,867 --> 01:35:06,285
Thor!

1059
01:35:07,286 --> 01:35:08,328
We're too late.

1060
01:35:09,705 --> 01:35:11,790
The Convergence is at its peak.

1061
01:35:12,666 --> 01:35:13,792
Can those things stop him?

1062
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:15,002
Not from here.

1063
01:35:15,168 --> 01:35:17,963
We can't get close enough.

1064
01:35:19,006 --> 01:35:20,257
I can.

1065
01:35:45,574 --> 01:35:46,575
Malekith!

1066
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:57,210
Darkness returns, Asgardian.

1067
01:35:57,336 --> 01:36:00,631
Have you come
to witness the end of your universe?

1068
01:36:00,714 --> 01:36:02,758
I've come to accept your surrender.

1069
01:36:22,319 --> 01:36:24,404
You think you can stop this?

1070
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:27,908
The Aether cannot be destroyed.

1071
01:36:28,033 --> 01:36:29,701
But you can.

1072
01:37:15,247 --> 01:37:17,249
Thor! No.

1073
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:28,635
Jane!

1074
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:51,199
Ah!

1075
01:37:59,332 --> 01:38:00,917
Everybody okay?

1076
01:38:45,504 --> 01:38:47,422
He's gonna come back.

1077
01:38:49,925 --> 01:38:51,802
Except, you know,

1078
01:38:51,927 --> 01:38:54,096
last time he was gone for,
like, two years.

1079
01:38:54,179 --> 01:38:56,098
Well, it's only been two days, so...

1080
01:38:58,016 --> 01:38:59,851
Did he say anything before he left?

1081
01:38:59,976 --> 01:39:02,145
Yeah, he had to figure
some stuff out with his father.

1082
01:39:02,229 --> 01:39:06,358
He kinda committed treason...
On our way out.

1083
01:39:11,196 --> 01:39:12,239
Oh.

1084
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:19,538
<i>You once said there
would never be a wiser king than me.</i>

1085
01:39:19,704 --> 01:39:20,705
<i>You were wrong.</i>

1086
01:39:21,289 --> 01:39:25,168
The Alignment has brought
all the realms together.

1087
01:39:25,252 --> 01:39:28,380
Every one of them
saw you offer your life to save them.

1088
01:39:29,047 --> 01:39:33,468
What can Asgard offer
its new king in return?

1089
01:39:34,636 --> 01:39:36,513
My life.

1090
01:39:37,639 --> 01:39:40,350
Father, I cannot be king of Asgard.

1091
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:45,230
I will protect Asgard and all the realms
with my last and every breath,

1092
01:39:45,355 --> 01:39:47,607
but I cannot do so from that chair.

1093
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:51,862
Loki, for all his grave imbalance,
understood rule as I know I never will.

1094
01:39:52,863 --> 01:39:55,532
The brutality, the sacrifice...

1095
01:39:55,699 --> 01:39:57,159
It changes you.

1096
01:39:57,242 --> 01:40:00,662
I'd rather be a good man
than a great king.

1097
01:40:01,246 --> 01:40:06,042
Is this my son I hear,
or the woman he loves?

1098
01:40:06,126 --> 01:40:08,670
When you speak,
do I never hear Mother's voice?

1099
01:40:10,672 --> 01:40:13,216
This is not for Jane, Father.

1100
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:15,719
She does not know
what I came here to say.

1101
01:40:15,802 --> 01:40:19,139
Now, forbid me to see her,
or say she can rule at my side.

1102
01:40:19,264 --> 01:40:20,599
It changes nothing.

1103
01:40:21,183 --> 01:40:24,519
One son
who wanted the throne too much,

1104
01:40:25,437 --> 01:40:27,564
another who will not take it.

1105
01:40:28,106 --> 01:40:29,858
Is this my legacy?

1106
01:40:30,025 --> 01:40:31,610
Loki died with honor.

1107
01:40:32,569 --> 01:40:33,945
I shall try to live the same.

1108
01:40:34,029 --> 01:40:35,447
Is that not legacy enough?

1109
01:40:46,458 --> 01:40:48,793
It belongs to you.

1110
01:40:49,544 --> 01:40:51,296
If you are worthy of it.

1111
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:53,882
I shall try to be.

1112
01:40:55,300 --> 01:41:00,013
I cannot give you my blessing,
nor can I wish you good fortune.

1113
01:41:00,972 --> 01:41:02,641
I know.

1114
01:41:05,477 --> 01:41:08,813
If I were proud of
the man my son had become,

1115
01:41:09,314 --> 01:41:11,650
even that, I could not say.

1116
01:41:14,152 --> 01:41:17,781
It would speak only from my heart.

1117
01:41:19,157 --> 01:41:20,575
Go,

1118
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:23,161
my son.

1119
01:41:25,288 --> 01:41:26,539
Thank you, Father.

1120
01:41:42,138 --> 01:41:43,181
No.

1121
01:41:44,516 --> 01:41:46,184
Thank you.

1122
01:44:04,197 --> 01:44:06,616
I present to you,

1123
01:44:07,325 --> 01:44:10,829
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.

1124
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:13,498
Whoa...

1125
01:44:16,584 --> 01:44:21,131
Asgardians, it's an honor.

1126
01:44:24,843 --> 01:44:26,928
You know why we're here.

1127
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:32,559
Of course.

1128
01:44:33,393 --> 01:44:35,645
But, if I may ask,

1129
01:44:35,812 --> 01:44:39,691
why not keep it secure
in your own vault?

1130
01:44:39,816 --> 01:44:42,735
The Tesseract is already on Asgard.

1131
01:44:42,861 --> 01:44:46,406
It is not wise to keep
two Infinity Stones so close together.

1132
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:49,534
That's very wise.

1133
01:44:59,377 --> 01:45:00,753
I can assure you,

1134
01:45:02,005 --> 01:45:07,218
it will be absolutely safe here,

1135
01:45:09,429 --> 01:45:11,931
in my collection.

1136
01:45:13,099 --> 01:45:15,518
See that it is.

1137
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:36,581
One down.

1138
01:45:38,082 --> 01:45:40,585
Five to go.
