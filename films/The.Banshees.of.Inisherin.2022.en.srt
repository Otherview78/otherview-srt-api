1
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,810
Colm?

2
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,580
Are you coming out
to the pub, Colm?

3
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,380
It's 2:00, like.

4
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,260
Will I see you down there, so?

5
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,180
I'll see you down there, so.

6
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,620
What are you doin' home?

7
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,190
Brother?

8
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,840
What are you doin' home?

9
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,970
I knocked on ColmSonnyLarry.
He's just sitting there.

10
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,670
Sitting there doin' what?

11
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,410
Sittin' there doin' nothing.

12
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,410
Smoking.

13
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,370
Was he asleep?

14
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,593
He was smoking, Siobhan.

15
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,460
How do you smoke in your sleep, like?

16
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,510
Have ye been rowing?

17
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,433
We haven't been rowin'.

18
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,340
I don't think we've been rowin'.

19
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,170
Have we been rowin'?

20
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,060
Why wouldn't he answer the door to me?

21
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,093
Maybe he just doesn't like you no more.

22
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,340
Pint, Jonjo.

23
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,140
Is Colm not with you?

24
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,910
No.Colm's always with you.

25
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:36,760
I know.Did you not knock for him?

26
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,180
I did knock for him.

27
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,753
Well, where is he? Just sittin' there.

28
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,820
Sittin' there doin' what?

29
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,560
Sittin' there doing nothin'.

30
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,880
Smokin'.

31
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,840
Have ye been rowin'?

32
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,273
I don't think we've been rowin'.

33
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,490
Sounds like ye've been rowin'.

34
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,630
It does sound like we've been rowin'.

35
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,370
Will I try him again?

36
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,420
That'd be the best thing.

37
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,626
Officer Kearney.

38
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,860
Never says "hello."

39
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,390
Never fecking says "hello."

40
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,220
Colm?

41
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,450
Colm?

42
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,940
The door was open, Colm.

43
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,380
Colm?

44
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,386
Where the hell are you headin' off to?

45
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,200
Everybody?JONJO: No, this is true.

46
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,560
He scored six points from open play.

47
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,273
He was barely the size of a dwarf!

48
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,250
This is true!

49
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,960
Howdo. MAN: Howdo, Padraic.

50
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,580
Sit somewhere else.

51
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,000
Huh?

52
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,270
Uh... But I have me pint there, Colm.

53
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,790
He has his pint there, Colm,

54
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,466
from when he came in and ordered
his pint from before.

55
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,800
Okay.

56
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,540
I'll sit somewhere else, so.

57
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,720
Are ye rowin'?

58
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,306
I didn't think we were rowin'.

59
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,460
Well, ye are rowin'.

60
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,840
Well, ye are rowin'.
He's sittin' outside

61
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,393
on his own like a whatchamacallit.

62
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,120
It does look like we're rowin'.

63
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,340
Well, I suppose
I'd best go talk to him, so.

64
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,130
See what all this is fecking about.

65
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,293
That'd be the best thing.

66
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,200
Now I'm sittin' here next to you,

67
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,893
and if you're goin' back inside,
I'm followin' you inside,

68
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,613
and if you're goin' home,
I'm followin' you there, too.

69
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,450
Now, if I've done somethin' to ya,

70
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,786
just tell me what I've done to ya.

71
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,670
And if I've said somethin' to ya,

72
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,630
maybe I said somethin' when
I was drunk, and I've forgotten it,

73
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
but I don't think I said somethin' when
I was drunk, and I've forgotten it.

74
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,760
But if I did, then tell me what it was,

75
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,760
and I'll say sorry for that too, Colm.

76
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,810
With all me heart, I'll say sorry.

77
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:57,680
Just stop running away from me like
some fool of a moody schoolchild.

78
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,346
But you didn't say anything to me.

79
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,510
And you didn't do anything to me.

80
00:08:04,546 --> 00:08:06,700
That's what I was thinking, like.

81
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,170
I just don't like you no more.

82
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,010
You do like me.

83
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,920
I don't.

84
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,880
But you liked me yesterday.

85
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,410
Oh, did I, yeah?

86
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,450
I thought you did.

87
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,700
Padraic.

88
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
Dominic.

89
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,320
What's the matter with ya?

90
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,100
There's nothing the matter
with me, for God's sake.

91
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,490
Look at this I found.

92
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,100
A stick with a hook.

93
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,033
What would you use it for, I wonder?

94
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,800
To hook things that were the
length of a stick away?

95
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,460
Where you goin'?

96
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,630
Down here.

97
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,070
As good a plan as any!

98
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,680
Have you any fags?No.

99
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,860
Uh, you do.
You always have fags.

100
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,660
ColmSonnyLarry's at Jonjo's
handing out a rake of fags.

101
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,820
Whoever's in the mood for one.

102
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,560
Is he?No!

103
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,560
You're behavin' awful unusual.

104
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,580
What are you doin' here?

105
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,190
Was the pub closed?

106
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,410
No, it was open.

107
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,810
Anything in the paper?

108
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,380
Just the Civil War still.Ugh.

109
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,380
A bad do.

110
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,020
Mrs. McCormick's comin' over later, Padraic.
I couldn't avoid her.

111
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,540
I don't know if you're gonna be in or out,
but you're usually out.

112
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,620
Am I?

113
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,450
You are.
Yeah, you know you are.

114
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,790
I don't care, Siobhan.

115
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,280
This is your house, too.

116
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,130
Is it six years since your
mammy and daddy died, Siobhan,

117
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,870
or is it seven years since they died?

118
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,970
It's coming up to eight years,
Mrs. McCormick, aye.

119
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,230
Is it comin' up to eight years?

120
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,010
Doesn't time be flyin'?

121
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,190
Aye, when you're havin' fun.

122
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,826
Oh, be off to the pub now, Padraic,

123
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,280
if you're gonna be annoyin' us.

124
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,013
I don't have to be down there
every night, do I?

125
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,640
ColmSonnyLarry's
scared him off, I suppose.

126
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,560
What did you hear of ColmSonnyLarry?

127
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,300
Didn't you and he used to be
the best of friends?

128
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,106
We're still the best of friends.

129
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,120
No, you're not. Who says we're not?

130
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,350
She says.

131
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,390
Ah, for God's sake, Siobhan.

132
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:52,200
I said nothing of the like,
Mrs. McCormick! I was just chatting.

133
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,050
Now, you go off to Jonjo's, Padraic,

134
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,100
and don't be getting under our feet.

135
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,010
Sure, Mrs. McCormick never gets a chance
to come over for a chat.

136
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,746
She never gets a chance 'cause you avoid her.

137
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,050
I do not avoid her!

138
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,866
You hide behind walls
if she's coming up the road.

139
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,150
I do not!

140
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,190
h... hide behind walls.

141
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,550
Good luck to ye.

142
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,120
Whatever it is you're fightin' about.

143
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,030
I didn't hear there was to be a session.

144
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,680
Last-minute thing.

145
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,070
Colm decided.

146
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,640
All the ladies love Colm,
you know. Always did.

147
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,040
Yeah? That's not true.

148
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,430
You're still barred,
Dominic! Out!

149
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,040
You said barred until April.

150
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:15,910
What are we now?

151
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,300
April.

152
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,660
Well, put that stick outside anyways,

153
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,960
and don't be bothering the women.

154
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:20,830
There's women?

155
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,960
There is women.

156
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,960
And good ones.

157
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,210
If we sat next to Colm, the women
would have to talk to us too,

158
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,510
and then we could get at them
with our small talk.

159
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,430
I'm happy enough sittin' here, now.

160
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,860
Are ya, yeah?

161
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,340
Are ya happy enough, yeah?

162
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,650
I can't stand the maudlin' ones.

163
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,090
Play somethin' dancey, Colm!

164
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,880
To dance to.

165
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,790
And not have that mope whining.

166
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,460
Here, amn't I in enough trouble
with him without your mouthing?

167
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,200
What trouble in are you in with him?

168
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,070
Uh, he just...

169
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,226
doesn't want to be friends with me no more.

170
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,810
What is he, 12?

171
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,733
Why does he not want to be
friends with you no more?

172
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,310
Shh.

173
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,106
Daddy'll kill us if we wake him
when he's been wanking.

174
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,350
You won't get into trouble
for taking his poteen?

175
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,393
I will get into trouble,

176
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,660
but fuck it.

177
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,010
I saw cannon-fire and rifle-fire
on the mainland tonight.

178
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,710
Did you see it?

179
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,320
That'll be the Civil War.

180
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,360
I know that, sure.

181
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,020
Me, I pay no attention
to wars. I'm agin 'em.

182
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:47,980
Wars and soap.

183
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,770
I tell you this much.

184
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,720
We're good at chatting, aren't we?

185
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,900
Me and you?

186
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,120
Your sister, does she like to chat?

187
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,260
Not as much as most women,
but she'll chat, like.

188
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,193
She more likes reading.

189
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,390
Reading?

190
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,260
Feckin' hell.

191
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,000
Reading.

192
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,880
And did you ever see her
with no clothes on?

193
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,580
I didn't.

194
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,410
Did you not, and you her brother?

195
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,680
Not even as a child?

196
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,460
I don't like to be chattin' about
these types of things, Dominic!

197
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:36,630
What types of things?

198
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,550
Sisters with no clothes on!

199
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,420
You saw my daddy with no clothes on.

200
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,950
And till the day I die,
I'll wish I hadn't.

201
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,290
Sure, don't I know it.

202
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,430
The tiny, brown cock on him.

203
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,400
What's the matter with him?

204
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,100
Maybe bad news he's had?

205
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,840
Daddy?

206
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:08,230
No, ColmSonnyLarry.

207
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,890
Didn't I tell ya I'd be off if you went

208
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,626
whining about that lummox one more time?

209
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,020
I tell ya, it didn't look like
he had bad news tonight.

210
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,620
It looked like a weight was lifted
from his shoulders tonight.

211
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,520
Just bringing me cows past.

212
00:18:35,606 --> 00:18:36,620
What?

213
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,040
I was just bringing me cows past.

214
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,280
I wasn't, you know, trying to...

215
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,020
You don't usually bring them this way.

216
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,370
I don't, but then the little fella

217
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,860
took a fright at a hen on the corner, so...

218
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,990
I only...

219
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,280
I only just saw what month
we changed to yesterday.

220
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,910
More fool me?

221
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,650
Changed to April.

222
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,973
So, will I be callin' for ya
on me way to the pub later?

223
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,410
I will so.

224
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,500
Anyways,

225
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,980
I better chase after these goons

226
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,746
for they're gettin' away from me.

227
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,566
Maybe they don't like me no more neither.

228
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,120
See you at 2:00, so, Colm.

229
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,560
Why don't you come down for a sherry later?

230
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:48,380
There's no need to be stuck inside
on a nice day.

231
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,740
I will so.

232
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:51,790
How's the book?

233
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,270
It's sad.

234
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,310
Sad?

235
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,780
Well, you should read
a not sad one, Siobhan,

236
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,806
else you might get sad.

237
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:02,930
Hmm.

238
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,720
Do you never get lonely, Padraic?

239
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,760
Never get what?

240
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,990
Lonely.

241
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,380
Do I never get lonely?

242
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,526
What's the matter with everybody?

243
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,700
Jesus.

244
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,790
"Lonely." Fecking hell.

245
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,060
Colm?

246
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,750
Pint, Jonjo.

247
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,850
How's he seem?

248
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,110
Grand, I think.
With me, anyways.

249
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,430
What are you doing?

250
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,560
Oh, so you're gonna be
an eejit again today, is it?

251
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,700
Amn't I allowed to have a
quiet pint on me own, Padraic?

252
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,570
Well, don't ask a man to call up
to ya at your fecking house, so,

253
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,480
like he has nothing better
to do with his fecking time.

254
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,830
I didn't ask you to call up
to me at me house.

255
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,400
And you do have nothing better
to do with your fecking time.

256
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,010
Huh?

257
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,620
You do have nothing better
to do with your fecking time.

258
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,710
I know I've nothing better
to do with me fecking time,

259
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,000
but there's better things I could
be doing with me fecking time

260
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,506
than to be calling up to ya
at your house, Colm Doherty!

261
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,280
Like what?

262
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,200
Huh?

263
00:22:20,313 --> 00:22:22,653
Like what else could you be doin'?

264
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,550
Reading.

265
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,590
Reading, yeah?

266
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,940
Me, this morning...

267
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,160
this I wrote.

268
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,810
Tomorrow, I'll write the second part of it.

269
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,850
And the day after, I'll write
the third part of it.

270
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,046
And by Wednesday, there'll be
a new tune in the world,

271
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,900
which wouldn't have been there
if I'd spent the week

272
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,253
listening to your bollocks,
Padraic Suilleabhain.

273
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,406
So, do you want to take your pint outside,

274
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,740
or do you want me to take my pint outside?

275
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,610
I'll take my pint outside,

276
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,286
'cause it's a shite tune anyways,

277
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,650
I wouldn't bother with it.

278
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,510
I was too harsh yesterday.

279
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,910
Yesterday, he says.

280
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,340
I know well you was too harsh yesterday.

281
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,210
And today.

282
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,430
I just, uh...

283
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,790
I just have this tremendous sense of
time slippin' away on me, Padraic.

284
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,973
And I think I need to spend
the time I have left

285
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,010
thinking and composing.

286
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,010
Just trying not to listen

287
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:25,033
to any more of the dull things that
you have to say for yourself.

288
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,020
But I'm sorry about it.
I am, like.

289
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,820
Are you dying?

290
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:31,940
No, I'm not dying.

291
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,680
But then you've loads of time.

292
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,330
For chatting?

293
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,600
Aye.For aimless chatting?

294
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,940
Not for aimless chatting.
For good, normal chatting.

295
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,560
So, we'll keep aimlessly chatting

296
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,910
and me life'll keep dwindling.

297
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,910
And in 12 years, I'll die
with nothin' to show for it

298
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,000
bar the chats I've had with a
limited man, is that it?

299
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,960
I said, "Not aimless chatting."

300
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,580
I said, "Good, normal chatting."

301
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,710
The other night, two hours you spent talking to me

302
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,150
about the things you found in your
little donkey's shite that day.

303
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,760
Two hours, Padraic.
I timed it.

304
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,240
Well, it wasn't me little
donkey's shite, was it?

305
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,080
It was me pony's shite, which shows
how much you were listenin'.

306
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,070
None of it helps me, do you understand?

307
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,550
None of it helps me.

308
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,206
We'll just chat about somethin' else then.

309
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,500
What's the matter with ya?

310
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,760
Nothin'.

311
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,110
Aren't we going for a sherry?

312
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,290
Don't feel like it.

313
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,290
No, I'm not having this again today!

314
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,680
Hey! What the hell's going on
with you and me fecking brother?

315
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,040
Don't come in here
shouting the odds at me

316
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,260
in the middle of the fecking day,
all right, Siobhan?

317
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,910
You can't just all of a sudden

318
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,440
stop being friends with a fella!

319
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,480
Why can't I?

320
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,480
Why can't ya?
Because it isn't nice.

321
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,720
Do you want a sherry, Siobhan?

322
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,970
No!Righty-ho.

323
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,440
Has he said somethin' to ya
when he was drunk?

324
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,006
No, I prefer him when he's drunk.

325
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,926
It's all the rest of the time
I have the problem with.

326
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,580
What's the fecking matter, then?

327
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,760
He's dull, Siobhan.

328
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,710
He's what?

329
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:40,930
He's dull.

330
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,070
But he's always been dull.
What's changed?

331
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,070
I've changed.

332
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,380
I just don't have a place for
dullness in me life anymore.

333
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,210
But you live on an island off
the coast of Ireland, Colm.

334
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:01,130
What the hell are you hoping for, like?

335
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,566
For a bit of peace, Siobhan.
That's all.

336
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,086
For a bit of peace in me heart, like.

337
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,700
You can understand that.
Can't ya?

338
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,190
Can't ya?

339
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,760
Do you think I'm dull?

340
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,810
No. 'Cause you're not dull, you're nice.

341
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,626
That's what I thought.
I mean, I'm a happy lad.

342
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,900
Or I was.

343
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,913
Till me best friend started
acting the gilly-gooly.

344
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,550
It's him, Padraic.

345
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:23,250
Maybe he's just depressed.

346
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:26,340
That's what I was thinking,
that he's depressed.

347
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,390
Well, if he is,

348
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,686
he could at least
keep it to himself, like.

349
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,193
You know, push it down,
like the rest of us.

350
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,530
- No, Jenny!
- Out!

351
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,530
Out!

352
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,710
She just wants a bit of company, Siobhan.

353
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,140
Animals is for outside,
I've told ya.

354
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,980
And people don't be laughing
at me behind me back,

355
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,680
do they?

356
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,070
No. Why would they be?

357
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,200
They don't think I'm dim or anything?

358
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,900
Dim?

359
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,550
No.

360
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,080
You don't seem very sure about it.

361
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,300
Of course, I'm sure about it.

362
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,306
Dominic's the dim one
on the island, isn't he?

363
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,820
He is, aye. By miles.

364
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,000
Uh, hang on, by miles.

365
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,766
And then, who's the next dimmest?

366
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,246
Well, I don't like to judge people

367
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,440
in those terms now, do I?

368
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,093
In what terms?In order of their dimness.

369
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,853
Well, I know you don't.
And neither do I, do I?

370
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,790
But try, like.No!

371
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,450
I won't try.

372
00:29:27,486 --> 00:29:30,206
There's enough judgy people
on this fecking island, so no!

373
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,840
You're not dim!

374
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,980
You're a nice man, all right?
So, move on!

375
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,920
I'm as clever as you, anyways.

376
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,093
I know that at least.

377
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,040
Yeah, don't be fecking stupid.

378
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,680
Huh?

379
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,420
What happened to you?

380
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,690
Me daddy discovered the poteen situation.

381
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,040
Oh, Jesus, Dominic!

382
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,950
You poor thing, ya.

383
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,740
What the hell was he hittin' you with?

384
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,220
A kettle was the final thing.

385
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,653
I wouldn'ta minded, but for the spout.

386
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,090
Do you want a ride to church?

387
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,686
Uh, feck them gobshites!

388
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,920
Dominic!

389
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,620
But could I stay the night
with ye the night?

390
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,286
Just for the one night, like?

391
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,140
Mm...

392
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,840
Well, just the one night, mind.

393
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,410
Nice! I'll see ye for supper, so.

394
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,840
Whoo-hoo!

395
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,900
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

396
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,773
It's eight weeks since my last confession,
I think.

397
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,810
Go on, Colm.

398
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,900
Just the usual, I suppose, Father.

399
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:55,070
The drinking and the impure thoughts.

400
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,990
And a bit of pride, I suppose.

401
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,706
Although I never really saw that
as a sin, but sure I'm here now.

402
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,780
And

403
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,650
how's the despair?

404
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,480
Not so much of it of late.
Thanks be.

405
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:14,933
And why aren't you talking to
Padraic Suilleabhain no more?

406
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,310
That wouldn't be a sin, now,
would it, Father?

407
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:21,800
It wouldn't be a sin, no, but it's
not very nice either, is it?

408
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,630
Who told you?

409
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,320
It's an island, Colm.
Word gets around.

410
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,850
Also, Padraic asked me
to put in a word, like.

411
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,940
I see.

412
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,850
So...

413
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:41,120
It isn't him you have the impure
thoughts about, is it?

414
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,600
Are you joking me?

415
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:46,520
I mean, are you fecking joking me?

416
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:50,220
People do have impure thoughts about men, too.

417
00:32:50,313 --> 00:32:53,280
Do you have impure thoughts about men, Father?

418
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,400
I do not have impure thoughts about men.

419
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,530
And how dare you say that
about a man of the cloth?

420
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,750
Well, you started it.

421
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,600
Well, you can get out of my
confessional right now, so you can.

422
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,306
And I'm not forgiving you
any of these things

423
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,150
until the next time, so I'm not!

424
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,540
Well, I better not be dying in
the meantime then, eh, Father?

425
00:33:09,593 --> 00:33:11,500
I'll be pure fucked!

426
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,986
You will be pure fucked!

427
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,110
Yes, you will be pure fucked!

428
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,870
Pint, Colm?

429
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,260
If you don't stop talkin' to me,

430
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,260
and if you don't stop botherin' me,

431
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,426
or sendin' your sister
or your priest to bother me...

432
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,993
I didn't send me sister
to bother you, did I?

433
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,360
She has her own mind.

434
00:33:44,413 --> 00:33:46,446
Although, I did send the priest
though, you have me there.

435
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,710
What I've decided to do is this.

436
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,890
I have a set of shears at home.

437
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,890
And each time you bother me
from this day on,

438
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,670
I'll take those shears

439
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,146
and I'll take one
of me fingers off with them.

440
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,980
And I'll give that finger to ya.

441
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,850
A finger from me left hand.
Me fiddle hand.

442
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,070
And each day you bother me more,

443
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,860
another I'll take off and I'll give ya

444
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,250
until you see sense enough to stop.

445
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:12,300
Or until I have no fingers left.

446
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,353
Does this make things clearer to ya?

447
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,170
Not really, no.

448
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,426
Because I don't want

449
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,353
to hurt your feelings, Padraic.

450
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,440
I don't, like.

451
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,610
But it feels like the drastic

452
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,326
is the only option left open to me.

453
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,570
You've loads of options
left open to ya.

454
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,693
How's fingers the first port of call?

455
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:32,670
Please, don't talk to me

456
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,670
no more, Padraic. Please.

457
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,410
I'm begging you.

458
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,320
But...JONJO: Shush, like, Padraic.

459
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,560
Just, you know, shush, like.Yeah, I'd shush, like.

460
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,290
I will shush.

461
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,290
Except me and me sister were thinking

462
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,250
you might just be a bit depressed, Colm.

463
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:54,990
And I tell you this much,
fingers just confirms it.

464
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,780
Don't you think, Colm?

465
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,220
Starting from now.

466
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,450
Well, I never heard the like.

467
00:35:22,493 --> 00:35:24,580
I never heard the like.
He must really not like you, Padraic.

468
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,150
Fingers!

469
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,533
Jesus. He's serious, lads.

470
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,980
He is serious!

471
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:30,793
You can see it in his eyes he's serious.

472
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,580
Just because he thinks you're dull.

473
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,913
That's going overboard!

474
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,380
Who told you about the dull?

475
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,080
Well, I overheard it.

476
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,013
Like, what was I supposed to do?

477
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,600
I don't think you're dull.

478
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,960
And jeez, if I was
to cut something off meself

479
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,610
for every dull person that came in here,
I'd only have me head left.

480
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,986
Do you think I'm dull, Gerry?

481
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,740
No.

482
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,880
That said,

483
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:57,080
I did think the two of ye always
made a funny pairing, like.

484
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,010
No, we didn't.JONJO: Yeah, ye did.

485
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,750
Ye did. Obviously, ye did.

486
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,630
'Cause now he'd rather
maim himself than talk to ya.

487
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,613
Colm was always more of a thinker.

488
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,540
Huh?

489
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,720
Why's every... I think.

490
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:09,940
Ah, you don't, Padraic.

491
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,006
You don't, Padraic.Your sister does.

492
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,680
Your sister does, aye.
Siobhan does.You're more of a...

493
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,113
You're more of a...
What is he?

494
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,990
You're more one of life's good guys.

495
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,210
You're more one of life's good guys, aye.

496
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,673
Apart from when you're drunk.

497
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,040
Apart from when you're drunk, aye.

498
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,690
I used to think that'd be a nice thing to be.

499
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:28,260
One of life's good guys.

500
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,860
And now, it sounds like
the worst thing I ever heard.

501
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,193
Ah, don't take it like that, Padraic.

502
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,960
Don't take it like that, Padraic.

503
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,220
We're on your side.

504
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,890
What are you smiling at?

505
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,400
What's this mope so mopey for?
He's just a fecking man, lads!

506
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,790
A fat, ginger man!

507
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,660
Ay yi yi.

508
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,620
I'll tell ya this much.
Ye two are awful mopey hosts.

509
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,066
Luckily, you won't have to put up
with us more than one night, so,

510
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,800
and try eatin' with your mouth closed.

511
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,150
Where are we now, France?

512
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,780
Will you tell him, Padraic?

513
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,206
Aye, stop being a little
fecking bollocks, Dominic.

514
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,940
No. Just about the mouth thing.

515
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,860
Colm Doherty and his fat fecking fingers.

516
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,473
He probably wouldn't even be able

517
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,366
to cut through the blubber
on them fingers.

518
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,846
Would you not want him
to have to do the one finger

519
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,080
to see if he was bluffing, like?

520
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,250
No, we wouldn't.

521
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,860
That's what I'd have him do,

522
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,033
I'd have him do the one finger
to see if he was bluffin'.

523
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,650
'Cause worst comes to worst,

524
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,606
he can still play the fiddle with
four fingers, I'll bet ya.

525
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,870
Or the banjo.

526
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,346
We don't want any of that.

527
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,806
We just want nothing
to do with him no more.

528
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,480
You don't. This gom does.

529
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,880
I am a gom, is right.

530
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,790
You're not a gom!

531
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,930
Jeez.

532
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,890
This is a depressing house.

533
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,240
Would you prefer your own, so?

534
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,580
I've heard it's a barrel of fecking laughs.

535
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,330
Well, touche.

536
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,550
Too what?

537
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,720
Che. Touche.
It's from the French.

538
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,946
And how is it, Siobhan,
that you was never married?

539
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,753
It's none of your fecking business

540
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,530
how I was never fecking married.

541
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,480
How isn't it?

542
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,570
How isn't it?

543
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,413
Was you never wild?

544
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:55,280
Wild? Was I never wild?

545
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,100
I don't know what
you're talkin' about, Dominic.

546
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,410
Wild, how? Angry?

547
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,240
'Cause I'm gettin' angry now,
I can tell ya!

548
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,810
Not angry. Wild.

549
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,550
You just keep sayin' wild, Dominic!

550
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,160
Wild!My brother told you, didn't he?

551
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:07,533
That you'd be out in the road

552
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:09,330
if you started talking stupid to me?

553
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,420
He said creepy, not stupid.

554
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,666
Well, you've failed
on both counts, haven't ya?

555
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,730
I have.

556
00:39:16,293 --> 00:39:18,540
I'm off to bed and he's not stayin'
here another night, Padraic.

557
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,280
I don't care how depressed you are.

558
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,740
I'd rather have the donkey in.

559
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,180
Foiled again.

560
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,960
But "faint heart" and all that.

561
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,710
Here.

562
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,890
Ye two, ye'll be all right.

563
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,720
Will we be?

564
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:39,106
Hello there, Mrs. O'Riordan,
I've the milk outside for ya.

565
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,886
So, it's the two weeks
you owe me for now, I think.

566
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,600
Nobody has a lick of news

567
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,950
for us from your side
of the island, Padraic.

568
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,500
Are you going to be the same as them?

569
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,860
I am, Mrs. O'Riordan, I'm afraid.

570
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,610
And I'm in a bit of a rush, so...

571
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,780
Eileen Coughlan had no news.

572
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,570
Vincent Shaughnessy had no news.

573
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:58,026
It was a poor old week for news.
But then it is, sometimes.

574
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,790
ColmSonnyLarry, he had no news.

575
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,450
Did he not?

576
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,320
That man never talks.

577
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,360
Eh, he talks sometimes.Up himself.

578
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,986
Aye, aye, anyways, so, it's the two weeks
you owe me for now, Mrs. O'Riordan.

579
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,060
As I was sayin'.

580
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,940
Ladies.

581
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,030
Oh, it's Peadar.

582
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,590
Peadar always has a rake of news.

583
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,030
What news have you, Peadar?PEADAR: News, is it?

584
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,770
Fella killed himself, over Rosmuck way.

585
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,690
Walked into a lake for himself.

586
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:29,300
Twenty-nine and nothing wrong
with him, the fool.

587
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,950
God love us!

588
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:33,090
No, not "God love us." Fool!

589
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,390
Another fella,

590
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,000
Protestant, of course,

591
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,270
stabbed his missus in Letterkenny.

592
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,180
Six times he stabbed her.

593
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,620
Good God!
And did she die, Peadar?

594
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,400
She did die, aye.

595
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,460
It wasn't with a spoon
he was stabbin' her.

596
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:47,930
That's a lot of news.

597
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,450
This man has no news,
don't ya not? No-Newsy!

598
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,913
Stukes never have news.MRS. O'RIORDAN: Stukes!

599
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,370
Funny.

600
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,420
There was a bit of news
I remembered, Mrs. O'Riordan.

601
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,740
Dominic Kearney's father
beat Dominic senseless

602
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,990
with a kettle Saturday,

603
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,093
and is staying with me
and me sister, Dominic is.

604
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,746
So, at least his father'll
take a bit of a break

605
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,086
from his beatin' of him.

606
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,510
And him, a policeman.

607
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,650
Isn't that news?

608
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,080
Ar, that Dominic's
an awful little bollocks.

609
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,480
That's no news.

610
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,910
Still, he was in a bad way
when I came upon him.

611
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:21,293
I'd beat him with a kettle
meself if I wasn't old.

612
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,570
It's news is all I'm sayin'.

613
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,920
That's no news.
That's shite news.

614
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,366
Okay, so, Mrs. O'Riordan, thanks for the...

615
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:29,970
I'll see ya when I see ya.

616
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,846
And you can tell that skitter of a son of mine

617
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,650
he'd better be home by teatime,

618
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,666
or it's over to batter
the both of ye I'll be,

619
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:00,346
and your dreary fecking sister, too!

620
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,310
Oh, hello there, Colm.

621
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,993
Will I see you at Jonjo's tonight
for that pint you owe me?

622
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,010
I owe you no pin...

623
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,053
You will, Peadar.

624
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,370
Good man yourself.

625
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,440
Whoa, stand.

626
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,180
Stand.

627
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,320
What's that, Jenny?

628
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,920
Will we go to the pub for ourselves?

629
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:20,370
We will. Come on.

630
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,326
One drink you're havin', lady,
then it's off home with ya.

631
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:43,220
I've a shirt that wants
ironing for the morning.

632
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:46,010
Okay, Daddy.

633
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,660
Aye. Off to the mainland
in the morning I'm headin'.

634
00:46:49,813 --> 00:46:52,146
That's why I need the clean shirt, like.

635
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:55,986
"And why are you off to the mainland
in the mornin', Peadar?"

636
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,450
Oh, thanks for asking, Colm.
I'll tell ya why.

637
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:00,133
They've asked for extra manpower

638
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,980
for a couple of the executions

639
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:04,330
in case there's any kind of a to-do, like.

640
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,810
Six bob and a free lunch they're payin' me.

641
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,250
And sure I'd have gone for nothin'.

642
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,973
I've always wanted to see an execution,
haven't you?

643
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:13,886
Although, I'd have preferred a hanging.

644
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,560
Who are they executin'?

645
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:19,313
The Free State lads are executin'
a couple of the IRA lads.

646
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:22,100
Or is it the other way around?

647
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:26,260
I find it hard to follow these days.

648
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,293
Wasn't it so much easier when we
was all on the same side,

649
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:30,413
and it was just the English we was killin'?

650
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,100
I think it was.
I preferred it.

651
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:35,190
But you don't care who's executin' who?

652
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,750
For six bob and a free lunch,
I don't care!

653
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,240
They could be executin' you.

654
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:42,110
Why don't you come with me?

655
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,486
You could write a miserable
feckin' song about it.

656
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:49,110
Nah, I'm only messin'.

657
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,790
Who are them?

658
00:48:15,913 --> 00:48:19,033
Music students, I think, from Lisdoonvarna.

659
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,030
Another whisky, anyways, Jonjo.

660
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,913
Jeez, you're goin' at it at a
fair old lick tonight, Padraic.

661
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,900
Yeah? What's it to ya?

662
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,240
Padraic, don't now...

663
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:16,413
Go get Siobhan, Dominic, would ya?

664
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,633
What are you after, gobshite?

665
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,290
Another beatin', is it?

666
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,606
You, copper, I'm allowed
to chat to you, aren't I?

667
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,726
It's just tubbyguts
I'm not allowed to talk to.

668
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:30,400
Actually, no, I'd rather
you didn't talk to me neither.

669
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,610
Oh, well, anyways,

670
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:35,000
do you want to know what the
three things that I hate the most

671
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:36,733
on Inisherin is? Not really.

672
00:49:36,766 --> 00:49:37,720
One,

673
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,440
policemen.

674
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,970
Two,

675
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,006
pudgy fiddle players.

676
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:46,400
And three...

677
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:48,813
Wait, I had some funny thing
for three. What was it?

678
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,280
Uh, I'll start again. One, um,

679
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:52,760
policemen.

680
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:53,890
Two...

681
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,890
Pudgy fiddle players.

682
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:59,160
Pudgy fiddle players.

683
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,070
And shite, what was three?

684
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:02,940
Go on back to your own gang now, Padraic.
I'm serious, now.

685
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:03,770
Serious, are ya?

686
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,640
And talkin' to me, are ya?

687
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:11,780
Siobhan!

688
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:17,073
Padraic's out of his brains
on whisky, and Colm's there.

689
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,220
You'd better come.

690
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:28,140
You, Colm Doherty, do you know
what you used to be?

691
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,140
No, Padraic, what did I used to be?

692
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,100
Nice!

693
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,450
You used to be nice!

694
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,110
Didn't he not?

695
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,070
And now, do you know what you are?

696
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,810
Not nice.

697
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,160
Ah, well,

698
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:45,680
I suppose niceness doesn't last then,
does it, Padraic?

699
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,510
But will I tell ya something that does last?

700
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,250
What? And don't say
somethin' stupid like music.

701
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:52,430
Music lasts.Knew it!

702
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,390
And paintings last.
And poetry lasts.

703
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,130
So does niceness.

704
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,610
Do you know who we remember

705
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,920
for how nice they was
in the 17th century?

706
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:06,310
Who? Absolutely no one.

707
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,440
Yet we all remember the music of the time.

708
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:11,580
Everyone, to a man, knows Mozart's name.

709
00:51:12,053 --> 00:51:14,520
Well, I don't, so there goes that theory.

710
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:17,800
And anyway, we're talkin' about niceness.

711
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,150
Not whatsisname.

712
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:22,590
My mammy, she was nice.

713
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,160
I remember her.

714
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,380
And my daddy, he was nice.
I remember him.

715
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:31,250
And my sister, she's nice.

716
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:34,690
I'll remember her.
Forever I'll remember her.

717
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:37,120
And who else will?
PADRAIC: "Who else will" what?

718
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,340
Remember Siobhan and your niceness?

719
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,220
No one will.

720
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:43,130
In 50 years' time,

721
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,180
no one will remember any of us.

722
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:50,050
Yet the music of a man
who lived two centuries ago...

723
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,970
"Yet," he says, like he's English.

724
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,530
Come home, Padraic.

725
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:57,710
I don't give a feck about Mozart,

726
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,970
or Borvoven,

727
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:03,280
or any of them funny name feckers.

728
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:04,890
I'm Padraic Suilleabhain.

729
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,070
And I'm nice.

730
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,770
Come home.

731
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:13,873
So you'd rather be friends
with this fella, would ya?

732
00:52:14,093 --> 00:52:15,340
A fella who

733
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,990
beats his own son
black and blue every night

734
00:52:17,106 --> 00:52:19,046
that he's not fiddling with him.

735
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:22,640
I never told him that, Daddy.
He's... He's just drunk now.

736
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:24,520
You used to be nice.

737
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,570
Or did you never used to be?

738
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:31,610
Oh, God.

739
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:36,530
Maybe you never used to be.

740
00:52:53,330 --> 00:52:55,030
I'll have a word with him, Colm.

741
00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:57,340
You don't need to do anything drastic.

742
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,030
He won't be botherin' you no more.

743
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,210
That's a shame.

744
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:03,520
That's the most interesting he's ever been.

745
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,820
I think I like him again now.

746
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,090
It was the 18th century, anyway. Mozart.

747
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:13,960
Not the 17th.

748
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,830
Siobhan Suilleabhain!
Well, well.

749
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,886
I only came in for rashers, Mrs. O'Riordan.

750
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:56,050
I've no time to talk, I'm afraid.

751
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,310
Letter came for ya.

752
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:02,310
Fell open, did it?

753
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,766
Aye, in the heat, I suppose.

754
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:11,500
A job offer, is it?

755
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:22,720
A job offer from a library
on the mainland, is it?

756
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:26,160
Just the rashers, please, Mrs. O'Riordan.
About ten of them.

757
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:36,300
You never tell me anything!

758
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:40,520
Well, it'd crucify him, your leaving!

759
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,220
Hey, no one's leaving!

760
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:59,410
Listen, I didn't come down to chat.

761
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:01,173
I just came down to say
that all that last night

762
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,590
was just the whisky talkin', Colm.

763
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,770
All what last night?

764
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,900
All whatever it was I was sayin'.

765
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:07,180
What were you sayin'?

766
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,160
Uh... Yeah.
I can't remember much of it,

767
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:12,786
but I remember the gist
of it wasn't the best.

768
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,250
You always know, don't ya?

769
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:20,700
Well, anyways, I just wanted
to say I was sorry.

770
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,793
Will we leave it at that?

771
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,933
Why can't you just
leave me alone, Padraic?

772
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,360
Huh?

773
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:30,230
I've already told ya, haven't I?

774
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,840
Yeah, I know. I was just...

775
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:34,440
I mean, why can't you
just leave me alone?

776
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,780
What are ya doing?I don't know.

777
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,640
For fuck's sake, like.

778
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,266
How... How's the new tune?

779
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:02,390
What?

780
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,230
Ar, for God's sake, Padraic.

781
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:20,710
How many more times?

782
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:24,280
I am not putting me donkey
outside when I am sad, okay?

783
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,260
Well, stringy bits of shite
I had to pick up

784
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,740
yesterday when ya let her in!

785
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,773
There was no stringy bits
in that donkey's shite.

786
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:31,846
There was bits of straw,
if there was anything.

787
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,590
Maybe it was straw, so.

788
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,690
I'll get us our porridge.

789
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:58,953
Was I awful last night?

790
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,890
No, you was lovely.

791
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:06,240
Well, I know I wasn't lovely now, Siobhan.

792
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:08,850
You were lovely.
About me, anyways.

793
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:12,020
Of course I was lovely about you.

794
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,360
What else is there to be about ya?

795
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:21,593
What was that? A bird?

796
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:23,400
What was what?

797
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:24,960
The bang at the door.

798
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,050
A bird?

799
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,100
Aye.No.

800
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,100
What was it, so?

801
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,800
The bang at the door?Aye!

802
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:33,340
What was the bang at the door?

803
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:35,110
It was, uh...

804
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:36,410
hard to lie...

805
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:38,890
it was, uh...

806
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:41,420
a finger.

807
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,380
A what?

808
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:47,600
Finger.

809
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,433
Jesus, Siobhan!
You'll frighten the little fella!

810
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:53,040
Throw it out, Padraic!

811
00:58:53,106 --> 00:58:55,960
I'm not throwing his finger out!
It'll get dirt on it!

812
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:01,100
Where... Where'd you put it?

813
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:03,140
Shoebox.

814
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,440
Oh, my. Oh, God.

815
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:06,310
Well,

816
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,790
he's serious, then.

817
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:28,060
Do we have to have it in here
while we're eating?

818
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:30,933
Once I finish me porridge,
I'll bring it back to him.

819
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:35,310
Are you feckin' stupid?

820
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:38,710
I mean, are you feckin' stupid?

821
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,053
No, I'm not feckin' stupid.
We've had this discussion.

822
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:43,646
You've got to leave him
alone now, Padraic. For good!

823
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:45,590
Do you think?

824
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,070
Do I think? Yeah, I do think!

825
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,890
He's cut his feckin' finger off,
and thrown it at ya!

826
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:52,770
Come on! It wasn't at me.

827
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,160
Well, what are we going to do?

828
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,080
We can't keep a man's finger.

829
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:27,190
Jesus, Colm!

830
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,500
Did it hurt?

831
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:34,353
Hurt awful to begin with.
Thought I was going to faint.

832
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:38,250
It's funny, feels fine now,
in all the excitement.

833
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:42,030
Would you like a cup of tea?

834
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:45,520
I won't, Colm. I only came up
to give you your finger back.

835
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:46,600
Oh, yeah?

836
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:49,210
Thanks.

837
01:01:51,090 --> 01:01:53,260
Cleared up quite nice, actually.

838
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,790
And you wouldn't have thought it would.

839
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,010
What do you need from him, Colm?

840
01:01:58,180 --> 01:01:59,620
To end all this?

841
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:04,360
Silence, Siobhan.

842
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:07,710
Just silence.

843
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:12,280
One more silent man
on Inisherin, good-oh!

844
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:13,800
Silence it is, so.

845
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:18,680
This isn't about Inisherin.

846
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:19,886
It's about one boring man

847
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,893
leaving another man alone,
that's all.

848
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:25,860
"One boring man"!
You're all fecking boring!

849
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:28,380
With your piddling grievances over nothin'!

850
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:31,080
You're all fecking boring!

851
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:34,740
I'll see he doesn't talk to you no more.

852
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:37,000
Do.

853
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,666
Else it'll be all four of them the
next time, not just the one.

854
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:42,440
You're not serious.

855
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,746
Well, that won't help your fecking music.

856
01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:49,710
Aye.

857
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,626
We're gettin' somewhere now.

858
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,670
I think you might be ill, Colm.

859
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:02,420
Do worry sometimes
I'm just entertaining meself

860
01:03:02,590 --> 01:03:05,120
while I stave off the inevitable.

861
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,290
Don't you?

862
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:11,340
No, I don't.

863
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,260
Yeah, you do.

864
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:53,270
Declan!

865
01:05:40,490 --> 01:05:41,530
Howdo!

866
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,490
Howdo!

867
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,586
Do you want a ride?

868
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,800
I will so.

869
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:48,890
Thanks, fella!

870
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,373
Oh, no, you're not that student
fella from Lisdoonvarna, are ya?

871
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:02,820
I am. I'm Declan.

872
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:05,380
Why?

873
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,720
They told me at the post office to try to find

874
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:09,066
that student fella, Declan,
from Lisdoonvarna.

875
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,520
Yeah, a telegram came for ya.

876
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:12,520
From your mammy.

877
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:14,350
My mammy is no longer with us.

878
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:16,480
Not your mammy, sorry.

879
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:18,513
Did I say your mammy?
Your auntie. Yeah, your auntie.

880
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:20,140
It's about your daddy.

881
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:21,790
What about Daddy?

882
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,530
Uh, bread van crashed into him.

883
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,710
The bread van?Yeah.

884
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,706
They said you'd best hurry home to him,
lest he should die all alone.

885
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:30,580
Die?

886
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,930
Or get worse, all alone.

887
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:36,453
This is impossible.

888
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,200
It's not impossible.

889
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,146
Bread vans crash into people all the time.

890
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:40,850
I know!

891
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,290
That's how me mammy died.

892
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:51,170
If it's the same fecking
bread van, I'll kill them.

893
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:08,750
Thanks.

894
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,433
What were you talking to the boat fella for?

895
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:16,160
For none of your fecking
business, I think it was.

896
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:18,100
Of course, it's me business.
Aren't I the law?

897
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:19,200
Fecking knob.

898
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:21,020
Huh?

899
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:22,833
Well, you can tell
that whiny brother of yours

900
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:25,186
I'll be around soon
for that battering I owe him.

901
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,680
A battering?

902
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:29,673
That'd be good, actually.
It might take him out of himself.

903
01:07:29,753 --> 01:07:30,860
Huh?

904
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:33,080
You're an awful strange lady.

905
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:36,133
No wonder no one likes ya.

906
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:04,890
Oh.

907
01:08:05,070 --> 01:08:06,590
Hello there, Mrs. McCormick.

908
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:10,940
A death shall come to Inisherin
afore the month is out.

909
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:13,030
A death, huh?

910
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:15,560
Maybe even two deaths.

911
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,650
Well, that'd be sad.

912
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:21,650
We shall pray to the Lord

913
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:26,130
'tis neither you, nor poor Siobhan,
will be either of them.

914
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,220
Well, is that a nice thing to be sayin'?

915
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,220
I wasn't trying to be nice.

916
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:33,490
I was trying to be accurate.

917
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:39,230
Fecking hell.

918
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,440
What's the matter?

919
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:16,530
Nothing.

920
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:52,880
Me daddy say he's gonna kill you Sunday

921
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,933
for spilling the beans
about that fiddling with me.

922
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:01,400
"Kill me," kill me, or, you know,

923
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:04,060
"beat me up a bit," kill me?

924
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:06,710
"Beat you up a bit," kill ya, I think.

925
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:08,500
Although he did kill a man once.

926
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:15,986
I'm sorry for that spilling
the beans on ya, Dominic.

927
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:18,110
I was out of order that night.

928
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:20,810
You was funny apart from that bit.

929
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:24,160
That's why I don't understand why
that fat fella threw the finger at ya.

930
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:25,573
He seemed fine when you were slagging him.

931
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,380
He did not.

932
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,080
Did he?

933
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:32,706
"That's the most interesting
Padraic's ever been," he said.

934
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:35,320
"I think I like him again now."

935
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:41,310
Aye.

936
01:10:43,446 --> 01:10:47,286
Maybe this whole thing has just been
about gettin' you to try a new tack,

937
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,780
start standin' up for yourself a bit.

938
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,100
Do you think?

939
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,580
Yeah, and be less of a, you know,

940
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:56,053
whiny little dull-arse.

941
01:10:57,126 --> 01:10:59,313
Well, I have been less of a whiny
little dull-arse, actually.

942
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:00,550
Have ya, yeah?

943
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,693
Just yesterday, there was this musician fella

944
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,620
that Colm was getting along great with.

945
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,640
And what did I do?

946
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:07,526
I went and sent him
packing from the island.

947
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:09,340
Did ya? How?

948
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:11,526
I told him a bread van
crashed into his daddy,

949
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,400
and he'd have to be rushing
home to him, lest he die.

950
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:18,430
Oh...

951
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:24,560
That sounds like the meanest
thing I've ever heard.

952
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:26,790
Huh?

953
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:30,360
Well, aye, it was a bit mean, but...

954
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:33,800
he'll be fine once he gets home

955
01:11:33,846 --> 01:11:36,500
and he finds his daddy hasn't
been hit by a bread van.

956
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:41,173
I used to think you were the nicest of them.

957
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,840
Turns out you're just the same as them.

958
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:45,460
I am the nicest of them.

959
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:49,550
Ar, Dominic, now!

960
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,640
Well, maybe I'm not a happy lad, so!

961
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:58,300
Maybe this is the new me!

962
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:01,560
Aye.

963
01:12:03,130 --> 01:12:04,650
Maybe this is the new me.

964
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:40,430
Howdo!

965
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,340
Jesus Christ, Dominic!

966
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:44,626
Would you ever stop creeping up on people?

967
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:46,633
You almost gave me a fecking heart attack!

968
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:47,806
I wasn't creeping up on ya.

969
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:49,026
I was sidling up on ya.

970
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:51,050
Between you and that ghoul, Jesus!

971
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:53,920
I always call her a ghoul, too,
because she is a ghoul.

972
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:56,580
Jeez, we have a lot in common, don't we?
Me and you.

973
01:12:56,750 --> 01:12:58,710
Calling old people ghouls and that.

974
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:04,450
It's a great old lake, isn't it?

975
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:11,720
I'm glad I caught you, actually.

976
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:14,666
Because there was somethin' I was
wantin' to ask ya, actually.

977
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,600
And discovering how much
we have in common,

978
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:20,430
well, it just makes me
want to ask you even more.

979
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,866
We don't have anything in common.

980
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:24,300
Uh, don't skip ahead.

981
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:27,513
But yeah, what I was wantin'
to ask you was...

982
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:30,870
Somethin' along the lines of...

983
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:33,400
Should've planned this, really.

984
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:36,146
Well, yeah, what I was wantin'
to ask you was...

985
01:13:40,466 --> 01:13:43,873
You probably wouldn't
ever want to, I don't know,

986
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:46,980
to fall in love with a boy
like me, would ya?

987
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:52,280
Oh, Dominic, I don't think so, love.

988
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:55,110
No, yeah, no.
Uh, I was thinking no.

989
01:13:58,290 --> 01:14:01,860
Not even in the future, like?
Like when I'm your age?

990
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,960
Yeah, no, I didn't think so.

991
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:14,520
Just thought I'd ask
on the off chance, you know,

992
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,350
like, "faint heart" and that.

993
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,880
Well, there goes that dream.

994
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,110
Well,

995
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:36,766
I best go over there and do whatever
that thing over there I was gonna do was.

996
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:37,630
Mm-hmm.

997
01:15:04,646 --> 01:15:07,280
Come on, Sammy, you have to dance too.

998
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:15,370
How are you, fatty?

999
01:15:15,406 --> 01:15:16,960
Dancing with your dog, is it?

1000
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:18,226
Well, who else is gonna dance with ya?

1001
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:19,913
Your poor dog has no say in the matter.

1002
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:22,100
And if you're too rude
to be offering me a seat,

1003
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:23,980
I'll be taking one of me own accord!

1004
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:28,420
Now, how's that for an old hello?

1005
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,470
Have you gone fecking mental?

1006
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,510
Have I gone fecking mental?

1007
01:15:32,690 --> 01:15:36,040
No, I haven't gone
fecking mental, actually.

1008
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:38,130
Not only have I not gone fecking mental,

1009
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:41,090
but I have ten fingers to prove
I've not gone fecking mental.

1010
01:15:41,113 --> 01:15:43,046
How many fingers do you have to prove
you've not gone fecking mental?

1011
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:44,660
Nine fingers.

1012
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:47,680
And nine fingers is the epitome of mental.

1013
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:51,050
That's right. The epitome!

1014
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:54,060
Heh. There'll be none of that!
I didn't come here for licks!

1015
01:15:54,106 --> 01:15:55,386
I came here for the opposite of licks.

1016
01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:56,426
What's the opposite of licks?

1017
01:15:56,450 --> 01:15:57,190
Huh?

1018
01:15:58,540 --> 01:15:59,953
What did you come here for?

1019
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:02,720
I didn't come here for anythin', did I?

1020
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:04,330
I just came to kick your door
in and give you a slagging.

1021
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,030
Well, you've done that, so you can go now.

1022
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,850
Haven't finished yet, have I?

1023
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:09,770
Well, I finished with your door.

1024
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,680
I haven't finished with your slagging.

1025
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:13,990
We were doin' so well, Padraic.

1026
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:15,690
I wasn't doing so well.

1027
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:20,210
I was doing terrible.

1028
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:22,220
All right, I was doin' so well.

1029
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:24,350
Yeah, well, it can't all be
you, you, you, can it?

1030
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,090
Yes, it can.

1031
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:28,050
There's two of us in this. No, there isn't.

1032
01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,440
It takes two to tango.

1033
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:31,140
I don't want to tango.

1034
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:33,140
Well, you danced with your dog.

1035
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:48,550
Talkin' of tangos, how's
your new tune comin' along?

1036
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,680
I just finished it, actually.

1037
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:53,353
Just this morning.

1038
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:55,600
No, Colm, that's great, like!

1039
01:16:55,770 --> 01:16:57,730
That's why I was dancing with me dog.

1040
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,950
I don't usually dance with me dog.

1041
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:04,000
There's no harm dancin' with your dog.

1042
01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:07,000
I'd dance with me donkey
if I knew how. And she did.

1043
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:10,790
Is it good?

1044
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:11,870
Your tune?

1045
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:18,930
Mm, what's it called?

1046
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:21,670
"The Banshees of Inisherin,"
I was thinking.

1047
01:17:24,450 --> 01:17:26,890
But there are no banshees on Inisherin.

1048
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:30,126
I know, I just like
the double S-H sounds.

1049
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,330
Aye.

1050
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,900
There's plenty of double S-H on Inisherin.

1051
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:35,990
Yeah.

1052
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:39,340
Maybe there are banshees, too.

1053
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:43,210
I just don't think that they
scream to portend death anymore.

1054
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:47,690
I think they just sit back, amused, and observe.

1055
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:49,650
Portend?

1056
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:51,740
Yeah.

1057
01:17:55,033 --> 01:17:57,946
I keep having thoughts about
playing it for you at your funeral.

1058
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:00,140
But that wouldn't be fair
on either of us, would it?

1059
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:17,110
Well, that's great that you
finished your tune, Colm.

1060
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:19,073
That's more than great.

1061
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:20,290
That's...

1062
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:22,900
really great.

1063
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:37,530
So, do you want to meet me down the pub, Colm?

1064
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:41,113
We could celebrate your tune, like.

1065
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:49,710
Only if you'd like, like.

1066
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:52,630
But I could run up ahead.
Order them in.

1067
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:58,146
Why don't you do that, Padraic?

1068
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:01,030
Why don't I run up...

1069
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:04,250
and order them?

1070
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:07,160
Well, I will so.

1071
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:13,080
Jeez, that went well!
And maybe on the way,

1072
01:19:13,126 --> 01:19:15,446
I can find that student friend
of yours, that Declan fella!

1073
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,253
I told him his daddy was dying,
so he'd feck off home

1074
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:19,830
and leave us alone,
but there's no need now!

1075
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,220
Sure he could join us.

1076
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:16,580
What are you sitting over there
for when I'm over here?

1077
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:19,173
Just thought I'd have a sit
for meself, you know.

1078
01:20:19,930 --> 01:20:21,240
Wait for me friend.

1079
01:20:21,410 --> 01:20:23,370
Are you fecking joking me?

1080
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:25,070
Your four-fingered friend?

1081
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,660
I mean, are you fecking joking me?

1082
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:28,900
No, I'm not fecking joking ya.

1083
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:31,820
He just needed a bit of tough love was all.

1084
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,240
Siobhan, do you want a sherry?

1085
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:08,630
No.Righty-ho.

1086
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:11,900
What are you doin'?

1087
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:13,200
Me? Yes, you.

1088
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:15,160
Nothing. Just drinkin'.

1089
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:17,160
Not waitin'?Not waitin'.

1090
01:21:17,193 --> 01:21:18,893
Well, he is waitin', Siobhan.
He's waitin' for Colm Doherty.

1091
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:19,820
I amn't waitin'.

1092
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:21,093
He just told me he was waitin'.

1093
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,520
Telltale!

1094
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:29,780
Come home with me, Padraic.
I've somethin' to discuss with ya.

1095
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:32,153
You've somethin' to discuss with me?

1096
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:34,530
That sounds, uh...

1097
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,790
I don't want to discuss somethin'.

1098
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,490
Well, ya have to, 'cause I'm leavin'.

1099
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:41,970
Leavin'?

1100
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:46,280
Like leavin'?

1101
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:49,060
Like...

1102
01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:51,890
not staying?

1103
01:21:56,420 --> 01:21:57,420
Yeah.

1104
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:42,510
But what about me?

1105
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:44,030
What about you?

1106
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:45,620
I'll have no friends at all left!

1107
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,730
You'll have Dominic. Ah here!

1108
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:50,130
And he's gone off me now, too.

1109
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:53,146
What kind of a place is it when
the village gom goes off ya?

1110
01:22:53,170 --> 01:22:55,090
And who's gonna do the cookin'?

1111
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:57,513
Oh, that's your first question, isn't it?
"Who's gonna do the cookin'?"

1112
01:22:57,570 --> 01:22:59,306
Well, it wasn't me first question, was it?

1113
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:01,940
"But what about me?" was me first question.

1114
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:37,300
Padraic.

1115
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:40,350
Padraic!

1116
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:47,310
Now?
But you can't be leavin' now!

1117
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:49,530
I can be leavin' now.

1118
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:52,240
I can't be waitin' round
for any more of this madness!

1119
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:54,490
What the hell did you say to him, Padraic?

1120
01:23:54,670 --> 01:23:55,630
Nothin' really.

1121
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:00,206
Well, I'd sort of had a chat
with Dominic earlier.

1122
01:24:00,590 --> 01:24:02,760
And a new sort of,

1123
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:06,020
you know, standin' up for meself
sort of tack we thought I should try.

1124
01:24:06,030 --> 01:24:07,420
God!

1125
01:24:07,453 --> 01:24:11,073
It was all going fine until he
chopped off all his fingers.

1126
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:20,480
Me books wouldn't fit.

1127
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:24,000
Would you look after them for me?

1128
01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:25,870
Ar, don't go, Siobhan.

1129
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:27,610
They're all I have, really.

1130
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:31,440
Apart from the obvious.

1131
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,320
You'll be back soon, won't you, Siobhan?

1132
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:44,890
Oh, Padraic!

1133
01:24:45,070 --> 01:24:46,590
Don't say, "Oh, Padraic."

1134
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,980
Say yes.

1135
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:07,400
Ah, Jenny.

1136
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:48,350
Oh.

1137
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:54,220
I don't want to talk.

1138
01:30:55,390 --> 01:30:57,220
Don't go killin' his dog now.

1139
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:58,560
And don't be puttin' things in me head

1140
01:30:58,610 --> 01:31:00,140
that weren't there in the first feckin' place,

1141
01:31:00,166 --> 01:31:01,533
you feckin' nutbag!

1142
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:03,790
"Nutbag!"

1143
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:59,446
What would I ever hurt you for?

1144
01:32:00,940 --> 01:32:03,293
You're the only nice thing about him.

1145
01:32:32,666 --> 01:32:35,353
How are you, Padraic?
You're lookin' well.

1146
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:44,800
That's lovely, lads.

1147
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:51,400
I don't need your apologies, all right?

1148
01:32:51,730 --> 01:32:53,420
It's a relief to me.

1149
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,170
So, let's just call it quits

1150
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:58,720
and agree to go our separate ways,
for good this time.

1151
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,740
Your fat fingers killed me little donkey today.

1152
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:06,790
So, no, we won't call it quits.

1153
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,540
We'll call it the start.

1154
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:10,620
You're jokin' me.Yeah, no.

1155
01:33:10,790 --> 01:33:12,570
I'm not jokin' ya.

1156
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:14,580
So tomorrow, Sunday,

1157
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:17,140
God's day, around 2:00,

1158
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:19,560
I'm going to call up to your house
and I'm gonna set fire to it,

1159
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:21,793
and hopefully you'll still be inside it.

1160
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:25,286
But I won't be checkin' either way.

1161
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:30,053
Just be sure and leave your dog outside.

1162
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,290
I've nothing against that gom.

1163
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:37,380
Or you can do whatever's
in your power to stop me.

1164
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,860
To our graves we're taking this.

1165
01:33:44,820 --> 01:33:46,753
To one of our graves, anyways.

1166
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:49,780
Here.

1167
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:51,920
I've a bone to pick with you, dreary.

1168
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:53,906
Is that little gobshite
of mine at your place again?

1169
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:56,080
Leave him, Peadar.
His donkey's just died.

1170
01:33:56,100 --> 01:33:57,490
Did he?

1171
01:33:57,660 --> 01:33:59,190
The little miniature fella?

1172
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:01,410
Well, Jesus, boys,
I'll tell ya this much...

1173
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:14,720
Two o'clock.

1174
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:18,090
I killed a miniature donkey.

1175
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:23,790
It was by accident...

1176
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:28,620
but I do feel bad about it.

1177
01:35:31,890 --> 01:35:35,460
Do you think God gives a damn
about miniature donkeys, Colm?

1178
01:35:37,810 --> 01:35:38,810
I fear he doesn't.

1179
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:44,200
And I fear that's where
it's all gone wrong.

1180
01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:47,770
Is that it?

1181
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:51,080
Is what it?

1182
01:35:51,250 --> 01:35:53,540
Aren't you forgetting a couple of things?

1183
01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:57,260
No, I think I've covered it.

1184
01:35:57,430 --> 01:36:00,520
Wouldn't you say punching a policeman is a sin?

1185
01:36:01,870 --> 01:36:03,570
Ah here.

1186
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:05,700
If punching a policeman is a sin,

1187
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:08,580
we may as well just pack up and go home.

1188
01:36:10,530 --> 01:36:12,490
And self-mutilation is a sin.

1189
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:15,593
It's one of the biggest.

1190
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:17,190
Is it?

1191
01:36:17,370 --> 01:36:20,240
Self-mutilation, so you have me there.

1192
01:36:20,410 --> 01:36:21,590
Multiplied by five.

1193
01:36:27,330 --> 01:36:28,860
How's the despair?

1194
01:36:33,730 --> 01:36:34,780
It's back a bit.

1195
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:40,500
But you're not gonna
do anything about it?

1196
01:36:44,310 --> 01:36:46,400
I'm not gonna
do anything about it, no.

1197
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:03,500
Dear Padraic,

1198
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:07,720
I am safely ensconced in the mainland
and, Padraic, it's lovely here.

1199
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:10,526
There's a river running
past my window as I write,

1200
01:37:10,550 --> 01:37:13,510
and the people already seem
less bitter and mental.

1201
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:17,950
I'm not sure why, but I think it's
'cause a lot of them are from Spain.

1202
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:21,650
Mostly, I wanted to say there's a
spare bed here for you, Padraic.

1203
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:25,390
And with the war almost over, I
think there'd be work for ya here.

1204
01:37:25,570 --> 01:37:28,000
Because there's nothing
for you on Inisherin.

1205
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:30,530
Nothing but more bleakness and grudges

1206
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:33,360
and loneliness and spite

1207
01:37:33,530 --> 01:37:36,360
and the slow passing of time until death.

1208
01:37:36,530 --> 01:37:38,840
And sure, you can do that anywhere.

1209
01:37:41,230 --> 01:37:44,370
So come, Padraic. Leave there.

1210
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:47,393
Dominic can look after Jenny
and the rest of your animals.

1211
01:37:47,410 --> 01:37:50,000
They could move into the house together.

1212
01:37:59,250 --> 01:37:59,950
Hut!

1213
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:24,760
So come now, Padraic, please.

1214
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:30,720
Before it's all too late.

1215
01:41:21,850 --> 01:41:23,540
Dear Siobhan.

1216
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:26,940
Obviously, I don't know
what "ensconced" is,

1217
01:41:27,110 --> 01:41:30,290
but I thank you for the offer
of the free bed and the whatnot.

1218
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:33,273
But I won't be takin' you up
on it, I'm afraid.

1219
01:41:34,340 --> 01:41:36,860
As I told you, me life is on Inisherin.

1220
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:38,690
Me friends, me animals.

1221
01:41:42,820 --> 01:41:44,300
Even now as I write,

1222
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:46,506
little donkey Jenny
is looking at me, saying,

1223
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:48,960
"Please don't go, Padraic.
We'd miss ya."

1224
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:51,310
And nuzzling me, the gilly-gooly.

1225
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:53,490
Get off, Jenny.

1226
01:41:57,230 --> 01:41:58,980
MRS. McCORMICK: Psst!

1227
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:09,680
In other news,

1228
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:12,500
in sadder news, actually,

1229
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:15,553
I won't be able to ask Dominic
anything, I'm afraid.

1230
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:20,826
Because they found him
in the lake this morning.

1231
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:26,910
I suppose he must've slipped and fell in.

1232
01:42:35,053 --> 01:42:37,920
So, there'd be no one to take
care of the animals, anyway.

1233
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:03,160
No other news, really.

1234
01:43:12,650 --> 01:43:14,390
Except that I love you, Siobhan.

1235
01:43:15,570 --> 01:43:16,740
And I miss ya.

1236
01:43:19,530 --> 01:43:21,440
And I hope I'll see ya again someday.

1237
01:43:24,450 --> 01:43:25,800
If you ever come back home.

1238
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:30,840
Come back home, Siobhan.

1239
01:43:36,240 --> 01:43:38,850
Yours sincerely, your loving brother...

1240
01:43:41,290 --> 01:43:42,550
Padraic Suilleabhain.

1241
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:18,600
Suppose me house makes us quits.

1242
01:45:20,820 --> 01:45:23,780
If you'd stayed in your house,
that would've made us quits.

1243
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:26,090
But you didn't, did ya,
so it doesn't, does it?

1244
01:45:38,190 --> 01:45:40,230
I'm sorry about your donkey, Padraic.

1245
01:45:40,930 --> 01:45:42,020
Honestly, I am.

1246
01:45:44,930 --> 01:45:46,410
I don't fucking care.

1247
01:46:02,766 --> 01:46:06,020
Haven't heard any rifle fire from
the mainland in a day or two.

1248
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:08,740
I think they're coming to the end of it.

1249
01:46:08,910 --> 01:46:11,740
I'm sure they'll be at it again
soon enough, aren't you?

1250
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:15,790
Some things there's no movin' on from.

1251
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:21,620
And I think that's a good thing.

1252
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:44,520
Padraic.

1253
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:53,873
Thanks for lookin' after me dog
for me, anyways.

1254
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:00,570
Any time.
