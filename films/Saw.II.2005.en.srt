00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,745
Help!

2
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:24,996
Anyone?

3
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:26,494
Help!

4
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:46,591
<i>Hello, Michael.</i>

5
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:48,872
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

6
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:53,382
<i>So far, in what could loosely
be called your life,</i>

7
00:01:53,449 --> 00:01:55,937
<i>you've made a living
watching others.</i>

8
00:01:56,681 --> 00:02:00,259
<i>Society would call you
an informant, a rat, a snitch.</i>

9
00:02:01,193 --> 00:02:04,838
<i>I call you unworthy
of the body you possess,</i>

10
00:02:04,905 --> 00:02:07,294
<i>of the life that you've been given.</i>

11
00:02:07,657 --> 00:02:11,072
<i>Now we will see
if you are willing to look inward</i>

12
00:02:11,145 --> 00:02:12,454
<i>rather than outward,</i>

13
00:02:12,522 --> 00:02:16,777
<i>to give up the one thing you rely on
in order to go on living.</i>

14
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:20,323
<i>The device around your neck
is a death mask.</i>

15
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:22,503
<i>The mask is on a spring timer.</i>

16
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:25,090
<i>If you do not locate the key in time,</i>

17
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:27,397
<i>the mask will close.</i>

18
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:31,044
<i>Think of it like a Venus flytrap.</i>

19
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:36,488
<i>What you are looking at right now
is your own body</i>

20
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:39,335
<i>- not more than two hours ago.
- Oh, fuck.</i>

21
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:43,711
<i>Don't worry.
You're sound asleep and can't feel a thing.</i>

22
00:02:43,785 --> 00:02:47,134
<i>Taking into account
that you are at a great disadvantage here,</i>

23
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,308
<i>I am going to give you a hint
as to where I've hidden the key.</i>

24
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:51,686
<i>So listen carefully.</i>

25
00:02:51,753 --> 00:02:53,346
<i>The hint is this.</i>

26
00:02:54,793 --> 00:02:56,866
<i>It's right before your eyes.</i>

27
00:02:58,377 --> 00:03:01,344
<i>How much blood will you shed
to stay alive, Michael?</i>

28
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:02,824
<i>Live or die.</i>

29
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:04,358
<i>Make your choice.</i>

30
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:06,181
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?

31
00:03:06,249 --> 00:03:07,972
Who the fuck are you?

32
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:12,063
Fuck! No!

33
00:03:36,713 --> 00:03:37,890
No!

34
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:40,740
Someone help me!

35
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:46,972
Oh, fuck!

36
00:03:48,065 --> 00:03:49,374
<i>Do it.</i>

37
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:52,888
Oh, fuck!

38
00:03:57,441 --> 00:03:59,296
Help me!

39
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:04,416
Help me! Please!

40
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:06,204
Fuck! What the fuck?

41
00:04:06,273 --> 00:04:07,418
Please!

42
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:13,654
No, no, no, no, no, no!

43
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,176
- Excuse me.
- Help you?

44
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,346
I'm here for Daniel Matthews.

45
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,342
Sign these.

46
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:57,818
Thanks. Let's go, Daniel.

47
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:02,207
Took you long enough.

48
00:05:02,273 --> 00:05:04,990
I'm sorry I didn't have it penciled in
on my schedule.

49
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:09,566
- They're gonna press charges, you know.
- Yeah. They're assholes.

50
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:12,251
Of course they are. You stole from them.

51
00:05:13,473 --> 00:05:15,447
This works out great for me, though.

52
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:19,350
Your mother gets to keep custody.
I get to take you into custody.

53
00:05:21,473 --> 00:05:22,847
What is it with you?

54
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:26,817
What, are you a tough guy
'cause you steal now?

55
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:29,248
Please, save me the after-school special.

56
00:05:29,313 --> 00:05:32,128
- Why are you such a cop 24l7?
- Hey, it's called being a father.

57
00:05:32,193 --> 00:05:34,779
Trust me, you're better at being a cop.

58
00:05:36,864 --> 00:05:38,687
I just think
I should go back to Mom's early.

59
00:05:38,753 --> 00:05:40,662
- What did you say?
- What, can you not hear me?

60
00:05:40,737 --> 00:05:42,777
No, I can't hear you. Say it again.

61
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:46,078
- I think I should go back to Mom's...
- Well, then, go!

62
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:48,634
Jesus.

63
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:01,148
<i>Hey, it's Daniel. Leave a message.</i>

64
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:03,486
<i>It's Dad. Sorry about yesterday.</i>

65
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:07,543
Look, I haven't heard from you.
Would you give me a call, please?

66
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,819
Daniel.

67
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:22,016
Oh, sorry, Sarge.
I thought you were my son.

68
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,070
Yeah. I'll be right there.

69
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:30,970
What do you got?

70
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,561
County asbestos cleaners
were working on a deadline.

71
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:35,542
One of them finds a body, calls it in.

72
00:06:35,617 --> 00:06:39,392
Says that this whole section's
been abandoned for two years.

73
00:06:39,457 --> 00:06:40,984
We've spotted people down here, though.

74
00:06:41,057 --> 00:06:43,195
- Who?
- Well, homeless, mostly.

75
00:06:43,265 --> 00:06:46,264
Bunch of kids held a rave
in the boiler room about two months back.

76
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:49,207
- Get an estimate on the time of death?
- Forensics just got here.

77
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:51,899
But it was the arriving officer
who called it in as your buddy.

78
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:53,856
He wasn't my buddy. He was an informant.

79
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,808
This officer IDed him
just by looking at him?

80
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,913
Well, he wasn't positive.

81
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:00,124
- That's why I wanted you here.
- All right.

82
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:03,771
Well, let me get a look at his face.
I'll tell you in two seconds if it's him or not.

83
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,783
Therein lies the problem.

84
00:07:26,304 --> 00:07:27,897
Yeah, it's Mike.

85
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:44,920
When were you gonna tell me about that?

86
00:07:44,993 --> 00:07:47,382
Thought you'd wanna see it for yourself.

87
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:50,045
Okay. Well, I saw it.

88
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,344
All right, look.
I mean, it's a little early,

89
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,839
but so far
everything matches Jigsaw's pattern.

90
00:07:54,977 --> 00:07:57,311
I can see that. What do you want with me?

91
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:00,377
All right, let's just pretend for a second
that this is new to us, all right?

92
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:02,620
Can you think of anyone
that would wanna do this to your guy?

93
00:08:02,688 --> 00:08:05,590
Well, he's an informant, Kerry.
You want a list of possible suspects?

94
00:08:05,664 --> 00:08:06,973
Grab a phone book.

95
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,496
Crackhead county punks
don't have engineering degrees.

96
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:13,147
Now, I'd say that our cause of death here
narrows that list down just a little bit,

97
00:08:13,217 --> 00:08:14,646
wouldn't you?

98
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:18,454
Sure. And you're the expert.

99
00:08:20,097 --> 00:08:22,399
Look closer, Detective Matthews.

100
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:26,362
At what?

101
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:28,861
Ask whoever wrote it.

102
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,709
<i>Hello, Michael.</i>

103
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:45,599
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

104
00:08:47,681 --> 00:08:50,779
<i>So far,
in what could loosely be called your life,</i>

105
00:08:50,849 --> 00:08:53,401
<i>you've made a living watching others.</i>

106
00:08:53,985 --> 00:08:55,992
You know, you and that guy
have a lot in common, Kerry.

107
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:57,275
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

108
00:08:57,345 --> 00:08:59,931
- You both like playing games with people.
- Excuse me?

109
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:02,302
Don't ever pull some shit like that again
on me at a crime scene.

110
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:06,045
- Look, I'm not the one taunting you. He is.
- Doesn't mean I have to take the bait.

111
00:09:08,128 --> 00:09:11,325
- Besides, I got a full caseload as it is.
- A bunch of desk errands and shit work.

112
00:09:11,393 --> 00:09:13,335
Yeah, well, between that,
IA breathing down my neck,

113
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:14,595
my son's budding criminal career

114
00:09:14,657 --> 00:09:16,065
and my wife's fucking divorce lawyers,

115
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:18,496
I'd say my hands are pretty full,
wouldn't you?

116
00:09:18,561 --> 00:09:20,732
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry.

117
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,149
I was hoping, maybe,
that I could bring you in on this one.

118
00:09:24,257 --> 00:09:25,517
We're not partners anymore, Kerry.

119
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:26,714
Hey, forget that we're not partners.

120
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:29,370
What about the fact that this guy wrote
your fucking name on the wall, huh?

121
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,455
He asked for you.

122
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,562
It's not the first time
some psychopath called me out.

123
00:09:33,632 --> 00:09:36,185
All right.
What about the fact that I'm asking?

124
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,474
Can't help you.

125
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:46,748
- Wow.
- You're the Jigsaw expert.

126
00:09:48,513 --> 00:09:50,651
When did you stop being a cop?

127
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:58,239
<i>Look closer, Detective Matthews.</i>

128
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:01,568
<i>This guy wrote your fucking name
on the wall.</i>

129
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:04,672
<i>Look closer, Detective Matthews.</i>

130
00:10:09,857 --> 00:10:11,384
<i>He asked for you.</i>

131
00:10:11,457 --> 00:10:12,951
<i>All right, fellas. Listen up.</i>

132
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:16,761
These are the best entry points.

133
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:20,985
They're the ones with direct street frontage,
vehicle access and good cover.

134
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:23,806
Now, remember,
we're doing this in broad daylight.

135
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,182
We don't wanna scare any civilians.

136
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,972
<i>Look, I've been there before.
I know the location.</i>

137
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,015
Let's just bust in there
and scare the shit out of anyone

138
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:30,266
<i>who happens to be inside, okay?</i>

139
00:10:30,336 --> 00:10:31,798
<i>We're going in teams of three.</i>

140
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:34,744
I'll go with Team Alpha.
Let's do this.

141
00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:43,071
Just like the good old days, huh?

142
00:10:45,865 --> 00:10:48,352
I thought your caseload
was big enough as it is.

143
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:49,766
I'm just tagging along for the ride.

144
00:11:06,757 --> 00:11:09,604
Alpha Team, I want you in front.
Baker, flank the side.

145
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,130
All right, let's do this.

146
00:12:01,341 --> 00:12:02,518
Freeze!

147
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,170
What the fuck?

148
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:21,500
Officer down! Officer down!

149
00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:22,907
<i>The fucking place is wired!</i>

150
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:25,013
Officer down! Officer down!

151
00:12:27,356 --> 00:12:29,266
Fuck this! Baker Team, get in here now!

152
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:31,315
- All right, go, go! Go!
<i>- Baker Team, get in now!</i>

153
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:40,821
Guys.

154
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:44,534
Talk to me, guys.

155
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:51,192
Go. Go.

156
00:12:52,764 --> 00:12:54,139
Officer down. Okay.

157
00:12:54,653 --> 00:12:55,798
Stand back.

158
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:57,462
Move him out. Move him out.

159
00:12:57,533 --> 00:12:59,256
Clear. Clear.

160
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:00,949
Stand back.

161
00:13:04,124 --> 00:13:05,368
Move out!

162
00:13:09,757 --> 00:13:10,902
Repeat.

163
00:13:14,652 --> 00:13:16,311
Freeze! Don't move!

164
00:13:17,724 --> 00:13:20,146
Let me see your hands.
I'm not gonna ask again.

165
00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:22,522
Put your hands where I can see them.

166
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:24,279
Down on your knees!

167
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:29,233
- Down on your knees!
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

168
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:38,388
Get him in restraints now.

169
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,202
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney.

170
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:53,651
If you can't afford one,
one will be appointed to you by the City.

171
00:13:53,725 --> 00:13:55,099
He's clean.

172
00:14:02,396 --> 00:14:03,411
Hey.

173
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:07,257
Is this close enough?

174
00:14:10,812 --> 00:14:12,699
Get his ass out of here.

175
00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:17,529
Actually, I will need to remain here

176
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:20,858
while you deal with your problem,
Detective Matthews.

177
00:14:23,644 --> 00:14:26,775
- What problem?
- The problem in that room.

178
00:14:35,836 --> 00:14:37,560
You keep him secure.

179
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,357
Clear.

180
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,671
Shit.

181
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:34,771
- What?
- I don't know.

182
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:42,934
Shit.

183
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,689
I think that's my son.

184
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,445
Fuck.

185
00:15:53,148 --> 00:15:54,675
He's got my son.

186
00:15:56,924 --> 00:15:58,713
What the fuck is that?

187
00:15:59,452 --> 00:16:01,557
Hey! Hey! What the fuck is that?

188
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,515
It's your son, Daniel.
You remember him, don't you?

189
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:04,988
I know who he is, you piece of shit.

190
00:16:05,052 --> 00:16:06,579
What is he doing on that fucking monitor?

191
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:08,791
Well, I haven't looked at the monitors
for some time,

192
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,421
so it would be hard for me to say,

193
00:16:10,492 --> 00:16:13,908
but I would imagine
that he's cowering in a corner

194
00:16:13,981 --> 00:16:15,158
with a look on his face...

195
00:16:15,228 --> 00:16:16,919
- You motherfucker!
- No, Eric. Wait.

196
00:16:16,988 --> 00:16:19,377
You motherfucker!
Where is he? Where is he?

197
00:16:19,452 --> 00:16:20,532
Where is he?

198
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:23,452
That's a problem you're gonna
have to solve before it's too late.

199
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,655
He has about two hours

200
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:28,443
before the gas
creeping into his nervous system

201
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:30,548
begins to break down his body tissue

202
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,653
and he begins to bleed
from every orifice he has.

203
00:16:34,588 --> 00:16:38,069
Oh, yes. There will be blood.

204
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:42,199
Tell me where he is.

205
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,792
He's in a safe place.

206
00:16:56,956 --> 00:16:59,323
- Eric.
- I need a phone.

207
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:03,100
- Eric, just listen to me for a second.
- Just give me a phone!

208
00:17:07,452 --> 00:17:11,314
- Look, everything about this fits his profile.
- I need to be sure.

209
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:14,967
<i>You've reached Daniel's phone.
He's not in right now, but if you'd leave...</i>

210
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:19,609
I'm sorry.

211
00:17:19,836 --> 00:17:22,203
We have something
counting down over here.

212
00:17:22,268 --> 00:17:24,090
Get me bomb squad, now.

213
00:17:41,757 --> 00:17:42,771
Hey.

214
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:45,618
Hey, wake up.

215
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:47,987
Hey.

216
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,827
Can you hear me?

217
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,073
She's still breathing.

218
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:04,308
What is this, house arrest?

219
00:18:04,508 --> 00:18:06,068
- Are we in jail?
- No.

220
00:18:06,492 --> 00:18:09,721
- This ain't jail, man.
- Oh, yeah? You done a lot of time?

221
00:18:10,012 --> 00:18:12,314
Yeah. Too much.

222
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:17,558
- Somebody open the fucking door!
- I don't think anybody's listening.

223
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,155
Damn. What the fuck is this?

224
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,009
Somebody's listening.

225
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,914
No.

226
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:29,239
Those types of cameras don't have sound.

227
00:18:30,492 --> 00:18:31,605
Fuck!

228
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,772
Fuck!

229
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,802
How do you just wake up in a room
and have no idea where you are?

230
00:18:38,876 --> 00:18:40,338
I guess you never been drunk before.

231
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,300
I've been drunk.
I spent three years at college drunk.

232
00:18:42,364 --> 00:18:44,852
This isn't drunk. This is kidnapping.

233
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:53,270
Look, I saw this movie on TV last week.

234
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,308
This guy, he was a reporter,
and he goes into this war zone, right?

235
00:18:56,381 --> 00:18:58,355
He goes in to sleep in his hotel room
the first night.

236
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:02,967
Bam! He wakes up the next morning,
he's in a cell with no windows and no light.

237
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:06,135
And he spent nine years in that room.

238
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:11,225
Nine years?
Man, that's nothing. Get over it.

239
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:12,502
What do you mean, "get over it"?

240
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:14,394
I mean, stop bitching about it
and let's do something.

241
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,275
- I think we should all just calm down.
- Shut up! Shut up!

242
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,901
I hear something.

243
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:21,877
What is it?

244
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:27,349
It's ticking. I hear ticking.

245
00:19:46,108 --> 00:19:49,403
Hey, hey, hey. Calm down. Calm down.
What's your name?

246
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,417
Amanda.

247
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:54,739
- Where am I?
- I don't know.

248
00:19:54,812 --> 00:19:57,430
Nobody knows.
We all just woke up here like you.

249
00:20:00,252 --> 00:20:01,593
No!

250
00:20:02,524 --> 00:20:03,636
No!

251
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:05,490
- No!
- No, it's okay.

252
00:20:05,564 --> 00:20:06,774
No!

253
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:12,723
- What?
- Fuck!

254
00:20:13,372 --> 00:20:14,452
What?

255
00:20:22,108 --> 00:20:24,018
What are you looking for?

256
00:20:45,276 --> 00:20:46,683
What is this?

257
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:49,782
Everything you need to know is on this.

258
00:20:51,676 --> 00:20:54,065
<i>Greetings and welcome.</i>

259
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,271
<i>I trust that you are all wondering
where you are.</i>

260
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,886
<i>I can assure you
that while your location is not important,</i>

261
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:04,568
<i>what these walls offer for you is important.</i>

262
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:07,571
<i>Salvation, if you earn it.</i>

263
00:21:08,124 --> 00:21:11,419
<i>Three hours from now,
the door to this house will open.</i>

264
00:21:11,932 --> 00:21:15,544
<i>Unfortunately,
you only have two hours to live.</i>

265
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:19,929
<i>Right now,
you are breathing in a deadly nerve agent.</i>

266
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:22,874
<i>You've been breathing it
since you arrived here.</i>

267
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,755
<i>Those of you
familiar with the Tokyo subway attacks</i>

268
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,300
<i>will know its devastating effects
on the human body.</i>

269
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,721
<i>The only way to overcome it
and walk out that door</i>

270
00:21:32,796 --> 00:21:34,651
<i>is to find an antidote.</i>

271
00:21:34,972 --> 00:21:37,493
<i>Several are hidden around this house.</i>

272
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,758
<i>One is inside the safe in front of you.</i>

273
00:21:41,148 --> 00:21:43,963
<i>You all possess
the combination to the safe.</i>

274
00:21:44,764 --> 00:21:48,659
<i>Think hard.
The numbers are in the back of your mind.</i>

275
00:21:48,764 --> 00:21:52,855
<i>The clue to their order can be found
over the rainbow.</i>

276
00:21:53,372 --> 00:21:56,154
<i>Once you realize
what you all have in common,</i>

277
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,635
<i>you will gain a better understanding
of why you're here.</i>

278
00:22:00,092 --> 00:22:03,441
<i>"X" marks the spot for that clue,
so look carefully.</i>

279
00:22:03,964 --> 00:22:05,622
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

280
00:22:08,732 --> 00:22:10,456
- Who is this?
- What does he mean, gas?

281
00:22:10,524 --> 00:22:14,102
- And how did you know where to find this?
- This is bullshit.

282
00:22:17,276 --> 00:22:20,757
"Do not attempt to use this key
on the door to this room".

283
00:22:21,084 --> 00:22:22,545
Fuck this, man.

284
00:22:23,004 --> 00:22:25,557
- Yeah, fuck this. That's a good idea.
- No, no.

285
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:28,115
- That's not a good idea.
- So what are we gonna do, huh?

286
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:30,676
- Sit here?
- The note said not to use the key.

287
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,667
Who gives a shit about the note, all right?

288
00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:36,529
This is all a fucking big goddamn joke,
and I'm about to end it.

289
00:22:53,324 --> 00:22:55,779
You better start talking right now.

290
00:22:56,012 --> 00:22:57,867
- What is this?
- It's a game.

291
00:22:57,932 --> 00:23:00,747
It ain't no fucking game!
My man just got his head blown off.

292
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:03,201
- He's testing us.
- Who's testing us?

293
00:23:03,276 --> 00:23:04,224
Jigsaw.

294
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,780
- Who the hell is Jigsaw?
- You don't watch the fucking news?

295
00:23:07,852 --> 00:23:10,340
- No. Who is he?
- He's a serial killer.

296
00:23:11,948 --> 00:23:13,225
No, he's not.

297
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,943
He's testing us.
He wants us to survive this.

298
00:23:16,012 --> 00:23:18,794
But you have to play by the fucking rules!

299
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:25,543
I'm gonna ask you again.
How do you know all this?

300
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:31,779
Because I've played before.

301
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:51,844
I want a tech team in here now.
Find out where that feed is coming from.

302
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:01,634
What do you want with me?

303
00:24:02,764 --> 00:24:05,764
- A little of your time, Detective.
- I don't have any time.

304
00:24:05,836 --> 00:24:08,291
You asked me what I wanted,
and I told you.

305
00:24:08,396 --> 00:24:11,942
Believe me when I tell you
your son is in a lot of trouble.

306
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,689
And what if I give you
a little bit of my time? What then?

307
00:24:18,763 --> 00:24:21,130
I only wanna talk to you.
Everyone else must leave.

308
00:24:21,196 --> 00:24:24,229
- Those are my conditions.
- No. It's a crime scene. Nobody leaves.

309
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,609
They don't have to leave the building.

310
00:24:25,676 --> 00:24:29,288
They just have to leave this area
long enough for me to talk to you.

311
00:24:29,356 --> 00:24:32,705
If you agree to that,
then you will see your son again.

312
00:24:34,188 --> 00:24:38,595
If I don't see my son again, I swear to God
I'll rip your fucking head off.

313
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,490
I don't intend to mock you, Officer,
but I'm a cancer patient.

314
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:48,489
How could you possibly put me
in any more pain than I'm already in?

315
00:24:55,116 --> 00:24:56,971
Just get them here now.

316
00:24:57,132 --> 00:24:58,441
All right, tech team's on the way.

317
00:24:58,508 --> 00:25:00,483
Should have your signal traced
within an hour, maybe two.

318
00:25:00,556 --> 00:25:01,930
He said he wants to talk to me alone.

319
00:25:01,996 --> 00:25:03,851
- Well, maybe you should talk to him.
- Well, fuck that.

320
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:05,225
Five minutes, old-school method.

321
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:07,560
He's not gonna respond to
the phone-book treatment. You know that.

322
00:25:07,628 --> 00:25:09,034
Don't underestimate
a tried and true method here.

323
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,888
I am the one who has been working
on this case from day one.

324
00:25:10,955 --> 00:25:13,192
I have been spending every waking moment
piecing it together.

325
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,365
Maybe that's why
you ain't got a goddamn family for yourself

326
00:25:15,436 --> 00:25:18,436
and you can't understand
what this man is going through.

327
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:25,153
- Don't.
- Look...

328
00:25:25,228 --> 00:25:26,689
I don't wanna talk to him.

329
00:25:26,763 --> 00:25:29,731
Listen, you already lost your son
one time before

330
00:25:29,803 --> 00:25:32,105
because you got involved with me.

331
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:35,233
It's not gonna happen again.

332
00:25:35,307 --> 00:25:36,900
This is bullshit.

333
00:25:37,676 --> 00:25:38,854
What are we gonna do?

334
00:25:38,924 --> 00:25:42,240
Just humor him. Buy us a little more time.

335
00:25:43,628 --> 00:25:46,246
You can win this, Eric. You can beat him.

336
00:25:46,987 --> 00:25:49,159
- Come on.
- All right.

337
00:25:51,627 --> 00:25:53,220
<i>...find an antidote.</i>

338
00:25:53,643 --> 00:25:56,164
<i>Several are hidden around this house.</i>

339
00:25:56,652 --> 00:25:59,237
<i>One is inside the safe in front of you.</i>

340
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:02,787
<i>You all possess
the combination to the safe.</i>

341
00:26:03,243 --> 00:26:06,855
<i>Think hard.
The numbers are in the back of your mind.</i>

342
00:26:09,356 --> 00:26:13,131
<i>Think hard.
The numbers are in the back of your mind.</i>

343
00:26:13,324 --> 00:26:15,745
<i>The clue to their order can be found...</i>

344
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,867
Shit.

345
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:15,397
Hey, wait a minute. Where you going?

346
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:17,923
I'm gonna find an antidote,
and I'm gonna get out of here.

347
00:27:17,996 --> 00:27:20,713
What? Antidote? You been in the joint.

348
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,536
You talked to the guards
that run the chambers.

349
00:27:22,604 --> 00:27:24,513
You know there ain't no antidote
for this shit.

350
00:27:24,588 --> 00:27:26,825
Look at this. The doors are locked.

351
00:27:26,892 --> 00:27:28,997
You hear that? It's wood.

352
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:32,744
Plaster. It's not a fortress.
It's a fucking house.

353
00:27:32,812 --> 00:27:36,227
All I'm saying is let's just take our time
and come up with a game plan.

354
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,456
Well, you come up with the game plan.
All right? I'm getting out of here.

355
00:27:52,683 --> 00:27:53,730
Look.

356
00:28:13,611 --> 00:28:15,750
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

357
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:32,514
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

358
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:35,522
You don't know
what's behind that fucking door.

359
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:42,408
Fuck.

360
00:28:42,475 --> 00:28:43,719
Shit.

361
00:28:55,403 --> 00:28:56,865
Clear the room.

362
00:29:03,564 --> 00:29:06,564
Okay. Let's talk.

363
00:29:07,756 --> 00:29:09,250
Sit down, Eric.

364
00:29:21,771 --> 00:29:23,560
I want to play a game.

365
00:29:24,588 --> 00:29:26,049
The rules are simple.

366
00:29:26,123 --> 00:29:28,425
All you have to do is sit here
and talk to me,

367
00:29:28,491 --> 00:29:29,898
listen to me.

368
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,937
<i>If you do that long enough,
then you will find your son</i>

369
00:29:33,003 --> 00:29:35,011
in a safe and secure state.

370
00:29:35,244 --> 00:29:38,724
We haven't been properly introduced.
My name's John.

371
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:42,082
- I thought you liked to be called Jigsaw.
- No, no.

372
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:46,823
It was the police and the press
who coined the nickname Jigsaw.

373
00:29:46,891 --> 00:29:49,095
I never encouraged or claimed that.

374
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:53,571
The jigsaw piece I cut from my subjects
was only ever meant to be a symbol

375
00:29:53,643 --> 00:29:55,814
that that subject was missing something.

376
00:29:55,883 --> 00:29:59,560
A vital piece of the human puzzle.
The survival instinct.

377
00:29:59,788 --> 00:30:03,104
This is all really,
really interesting, John,

378
00:30:04,396 --> 00:30:06,468
but right now
I'd really like for you to talk to me...

379
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,295
I am talking to you.

380
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,663
You're not listening.

381
00:30:11,564 --> 00:30:14,498
- Don't forget the rules.
- I'm listening to you,

382
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:18,019
but all I'm hearing
is the same sick fucking bullshit

383
00:30:18,092 --> 00:30:20,547
that comes about two seconds
into every interview I've ever done

384
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,049
with one of you fucking people.

385
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:25,058
Well, that's an interesting approach
to police work, isn't it?

386
00:30:25,131 --> 00:30:28,743
Aren't you supposed to be convincing me
that I'm your friend,

387
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:33,159
lulling me into a false sense of security
so that I'll confide in you?

388
00:30:33,739 --> 00:30:37,863
It's a little hard to follow the manual
when you've got my son, John.

389
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:39,241
The manual?

390
00:30:40,108 --> 00:30:42,628
What do you really wanna do to me
right now, huh?

391
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,423
What would you have done
five years ago, huh?

392
00:30:44,491 --> 00:30:46,596
Would you have followed the manual then?

393
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:49,635
Would you have broken my jaw
with a flashlight?

394
00:30:49,835 --> 00:30:53,032
You seem to know a whole lot about me.

395
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,580
I know you were once considered
a fearless police officer.

396
00:30:59,147 --> 00:31:02,977
Do you feel a whole lot safer
now that you only sit behind a desk?

397
00:31:03,052 --> 00:31:05,288
I feel a whole lot of things right now.

398
00:31:05,355 --> 00:31:08,105
But you feel alive. That's what you feel.

399
00:31:08,651 --> 00:31:10,375
And that's the point.

400
00:31:12,044 --> 00:31:13,254
Would you

401
00:31:14,891 --> 00:31:17,574
kindly get me a glass of water?

402
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,387
I would very much appreciate that.

403
00:31:49,803 --> 00:31:51,013
Fuck!

404
00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:54,180
Well, we've established

405
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:57,415
that the macho-bullshit approach
isn't opening the door.

406
00:31:57,483 --> 00:32:00,265
- Any other suggestions?
- Look who's talking.

407
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:03,685
The only door you know how to open
is between your legs.

408
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,664
- Why don't you shut the hell up, all right?
- Come on, man.

409
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:07,594
- Why don't you shut the hell up?
- I'm sick of your bullshit.

410
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,547
- That's right, back up, bitch!
- You little dickhead.

411
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:10,559
- Asshole!
- Hey!

412
00:32:10,635 --> 00:32:12,806
What you gonna do?
Yeah, yeah, that's right, back up!

413
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:15,428
Okay, man. All right.
Nobody take shit from nobody.

414
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:17,354
We've established that.

415
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,314
- Did you find anything?
- No. Nothing.

416
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:40,868
So, that ink on your arm,
that's Joliet, right?

417
00:32:40,939 --> 00:32:42,630
Yeah. So?

418
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,514
- Well, I did a stretch there myself.
- I'm proud of you.

419
00:32:46,315 --> 00:32:48,650
And you, what is your
correctional facility of choice?

420
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:49,763
What's your point?

421
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:53,184
My point is, you didn't get that way
by teaching grade school, right?

422
00:32:53,868 --> 00:32:55,875
That makes three of us that's done time.

423
00:32:55,947 --> 00:32:57,736
I think we should be
concentrating on that tape,

424
00:32:57,804 --> 00:33:00,902
'cause that tape said we have
more in common than we know.

425
00:33:00,971 --> 00:33:03,360
I say the three of us doing stretches...

426
00:33:03,435 --> 00:33:06,469
Hey! I found a door over here.

427
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:23,753
I need the flashlight.

428
00:33:56,012 --> 00:33:57,353
Over there.

429
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,731
What the fuck?

430
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:13,671
Oh, shit!

431
00:34:16,811 --> 00:34:17,826
Hey!

432
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:20,516
- Damn, kid.
- Sorry.

433
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:31,139
- "Obi".
- What the fuck is a Obi?

434
00:34:31,595 --> 00:34:34,464
Obi. It's my name.

435
00:34:44,491 --> 00:34:47,393
<i>Hello, Obi. I want to play a game.</i>

436
00:34:47,915 --> 00:34:50,468
<i>For years,
you have burned those around you</i>

437
00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:53,605
<i>with your lies, cons and deceits.</i>

438
00:34:53,868 --> 00:34:56,802
<i>Now you'll have a chance
to redeem yourself</i>

439
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:59,079
<i>for the games you've played with others</i>

440
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:01,002
<i>by playing one of mine.</i>

441
00:35:01,548 --> 00:35:04,744
<i>Inside the device in front of you
are two antidotes</i>

442
00:35:04,843 --> 00:35:07,745
<i>for the poison
coursing through your veins.</i>

443
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:11,298
<i>One is my gift to you
for helping me kidnap the others.</i>

444
00:35:11,595 --> 00:35:14,116
<i>The second is yours to donate.</i>

445
00:35:14,251 --> 00:35:17,666
<i>However,
one of them will come with a price.</i>

446
00:35:18,091 --> 00:35:19,520
<i>Remember, Obi,</i>

447
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:24,261
<i>once you are in hell,
only the devil can help you out.</i>

448
00:35:24,715 --> 00:35:27,977
Wait a minute.
What does that mean, "kidnap the others"?

449
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,912
- How would I know?
- Because you put us here.

450
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:35,379
The car.

451
00:35:36,331 --> 00:35:37,607
It was...

452
00:35:41,771 --> 00:35:43,364
I knew I knew him.

453
00:35:44,587 --> 00:35:48,297
You're the last person I saw
before I woke up here.

454
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,193
You did this.

455
00:35:53,063 --> 00:35:55,812
Are you sure it's him?
You better be sure.

456
00:35:56,711 --> 00:35:58,085
I'm sure.

457
00:35:59,175 --> 00:36:01,313
You would have done the same.
I did what I had to do.

458
00:36:01,383 --> 00:36:03,238
I'll give you a choice.

459
00:36:04,103 --> 00:36:07,878
- You got five seconds to get us out of here.
- I don't know the way out.

460
00:36:08,807 --> 00:36:12,222
Bullshit! You put us in here.
You can get us out of here.

461
00:36:13,703 --> 00:36:15,132
No, I can't.

462
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:17,922
- Then you're a dead man.
- So are you.

463
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:21,090
He's not gonna... Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait, listen to me.

464
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:23,363
Okay, we got two antidotes
at the back of that oven.

465
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:27,140
- We're wasting time here.
- Wasting time? Are you kidding me?

466
00:36:27,207 --> 00:36:29,695
He kidnapped me in the middle of the night.

467
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:31,677
We don't even know
what's in those syringes.

468
00:36:31,751 --> 00:36:34,304
You willing to stick yourself in the arm
to find out?

469
00:36:36,135 --> 00:36:37,564
Okay, wait. So who gets them?

470
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:39,908
I mean, there's two.
So which two people get the antidote?

471
00:36:39,975 --> 00:36:41,917
We'll work that out later!

472
00:36:46,023 --> 00:36:48,259
Right now you're going in there

473
00:36:49,447 --> 00:36:51,781
or I'll kill you where you stand.

474
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:00,863
Shit.

475
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:06,398
If you're gonna threaten me with a knife,
you may as well cut me a little.

476
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,185
I guess I'm going in there
to get those needles.

477
00:37:17,255 --> 00:37:18,815
But I get one.

478
00:37:49,095 --> 00:37:51,135
- One for me.
- Hurry up.

479
00:37:53,511 --> 00:37:57,155
Come on, baby.
You guys can fight over this one.

480
00:37:59,687 --> 00:38:01,214
Thank you, Obi.

481
00:38:02,023 --> 00:38:03,332
Come on.

482
00:38:04,135 --> 00:38:06,917
- Oh, shit. The fucking door closed!
- Open the door!

483
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,566
Open the door!

484
00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:13,793
It's locked. I can't open it.

485
00:38:14,567 --> 00:38:16,193
Open the door!

486
00:38:17,927 --> 00:38:20,414
Open the fucking door! Not funny!

487
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:22,295
Come on! Get him out of there!

488
00:38:22,363 --> 00:38:23,770
The door!

489
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,112
The nail!

490
00:38:25,723 --> 00:38:27,414
I can't get it open!

491
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:32,312
- Get him out of there!
- Not funny!

492
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:52,642
Use your coat! Use your fucking coat!

493
00:38:53,195 --> 00:38:56,392
- Come on! He's burning up!
- Stop it!

494
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:04,277
- Come on!
- Turn! Turn!

495
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:05,655
Stop it.

496
00:39:05,723 --> 00:39:07,250
- You gotta put your weight on it.
- Stop it.

497
00:39:07,322 --> 00:39:08,322
My man's dying!

498
00:39:11,387 --> 00:39:13,209
Guys, there's a window over here.

499
00:39:13,255 --> 00:39:15,262
- He's got the antidote.
- Stop it!

500
00:39:15,335 --> 00:39:16,676
Get him out.

501
00:39:18,887 --> 00:39:20,229
- Hurry!
- Get it open.

502
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:21,744
- Fuck!
- ...glass or something.

503
00:39:21,815 --> 00:39:24,433
Hang on, man. We're
gonna get you out.

504
00:39:24,755 --> 00:39:25,755
Shit.

505
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:30,408
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

506
00:39:31,059 --> 00:39:34,801
Get out of the fucking way!
Go on, move! Move!

507
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:38,186
Here. Shit! Come on!

508
00:40:10,483 --> 00:40:11,483
The needles!

509
00:40:11,538 --> 00:40:14,091
He ain't got the fucking needles!
It's fucking in there!

510
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:17,064
I want the fucking needles!
I want the fucking needles!

511
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:18,448
Calm down.

512
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:21,229
- Fuck!
- The needles are fucking melted.

513
00:40:22,675 --> 00:40:24,104
They're gone.

514
00:40:25,363 --> 00:40:26,890
He had a choice.

515
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:32,109
Another one down, Kerry.

516
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:33,902
How much more time are we gonna
waste on this bastard?

517
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,871
We're not wasting time.
We're doing exactly what we should be...

518
00:40:35,871 --> 00:40:37,352
It's not what it looks like to me.

519
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:39,835
<i>You see, Detective,
Darwin's theory of evolution</i>

520
00:40:40,007 --> 00:40:43,138
and survival of the fittest,
based on his little trip to the Galápagos,

521
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,800
no longer applies on this planet.

522
00:40:44,871 --> 00:40:47,359
We have a human race
that doesn't have the edge

523
00:40:47,431 --> 00:40:49,667
or the will to survive.

524
00:40:49,734 --> 00:40:52,734
- What the fuck do you want?
- It's hard to remain calm, isn't it,

525
00:40:52,807 --> 00:40:55,841
when your son is walking around
on those monitors?

526
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:59,260
I can't give you what you want
if you don't tell me what the fuck it is.

527
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:00,927
I told you what it is.

528
00:41:00,998 --> 00:41:03,998
- Just remember the rules.
- No, you said you wanted to talk.

529
00:41:04,071 --> 00:41:08,130
Then you said you wanted to play a game.
You're talking, but it means nothing!

530
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:11,100
What do you think
the cure for cancer is, Eric?

531
00:41:11,175 --> 00:41:13,313
- What?
- The cure for cancer.

532
00:41:13,382 --> 00:41:15,684
- What is it?
- I don't know what it is,

533
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,758
but I know
it's not killing and torturing people

534
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,292
for your own sick fucking pleasure.

535
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:23,109
I've never murdered anyone in my life.
The decisions are up to them.

536
00:41:23,175 --> 00:41:24,637
Yeah, well,
putting a gun to someone's head

537
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:26,653
and forcing them to pull the trigger
is still murder.

538
00:41:26,727 --> 00:41:29,247
Since when is force a problem for you?

539
00:41:31,527 --> 00:41:34,396
Why are you so desperate
to get your son back?

540
00:41:36,295 --> 00:41:37,953
'Cause he's my son.

541
00:41:38,182 --> 00:41:41,695
What's the last thing you said to him
before you left him?

542
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:44,766
Well, then, go!

543
00:41:46,055 --> 00:41:49,055
Seems to me that the knowledge
of your son's impending death

544
00:41:49,127 --> 00:41:50,621
is causing you to act.

545
00:41:54,927 --> 00:41:59,018
Why is it that we're only willing
to do that when a life is at stake?

546
00:41:59,086 --> 00:42:01,225
I've always loved my son.
That's never changed.

547
00:42:01,295 --> 00:42:03,848
No, no. It's changed now.

548
00:42:05,295 --> 00:42:07,434
You see, the knowledge of death
changes everything.

549
00:42:07,503 --> 00:42:11,627
If I were to tell you the exact date
and time of your own death,

550
00:42:12,078 --> 00:42:14,664
it would shatter your world completely.

551
00:42:15,215 --> 00:42:16,392
I know.

552
00:42:18,095 --> 00:42:21,258
<i>Can you imagine what it feels like
to have someone sit you down...</i>

553
00:42:21,326 --> 00:42:22,701
John Kramer.

554
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:25,610
<i>...and tell you that you're dying?</i>

555
00:42:28,398 --> 00:42:30,373
<i>The gravity of that?</i>

556
00:42:33,263 --> 00:42:35,335
That the clock's ticking for you.

557
00:42:38,446 --> 00:42:41,032
<i>In a split second,
your world is cracked open.</i>

558
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:44,070
<i>You look at things differently.
You smell things differently.</i>

559
00:42:44,943 --> 00:42:49,001
You savor everything, be it a glass
of water or a walk in the park.

560
00:42:49,439 --> 00:42:51,772
- The clock is ticking, John.
- But most people have the luxury

561
00:42:51,842 --> 00:42:54,147
of not knowing when
that clock's gonna go off,

562
00:42:54,218 --> 00:42:57,480
and the irony of it is that that keeps
them from really living their life.

563
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:01,785
It keeps them drinking that glass of water,
but never really tasting it.

564
00:43:02,138 --> 00:43:04,277
You can still fix this, John.

565
00:43:05,659 --> 00:43:07,634
Yeah, but can we fix you?

566
00:43:08,154 --> 00:43:09,154
Me?

567
00:43:10,235 --> 00:43:11,795
I'm not fixable.

568
00:43:12,538 --> 00:43:14,065
I've got cancer.

569
00:43:17,915 --> 00:43:20,304
You're using cancer as an excuse
for what you do?

570
00:43:20,378 --> 00:43:21,589
No.

571
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:26,138
The cancer isn't what started me
in my work.

572
00:43:27,259 --> 00:43:29,877
It was the moment I decided to end my life

573
00:43:29,947 --> 00:43:31,987
that started me in my work

574
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:34,001
and brought meaning to it.

575
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:40,079
Fuck!

576
00:43:40,155 --> 00:43:43,122
<i>I had literally driven myself to suicide,</i>

577
00:43:43,195 --> 00:43:44,788
and I had failed.

578
00:43:45,082 --> 00:43:48,497
<i>My body had not been strong enough
to repel cancer cells,</i>

579
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:51,445
yet I had lived
through a plunge off a cliff.

580
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:00,593
But, to my amazement, I was alive.

581
00:44:02,043 --> 00:44:05,076
<i>And I was determined
to spend the rest of my days</i>

582
00:44:05,627 --> 00:44:08,016
<i>testing the fabric of human nature.</i>

583
00:44:13,211 --> 00:44:15,098
Do you understand, Eric?

584
00:44:15,867 --> 00:44:19,096
You got a chance to do something.
Do it right now, John.

585
00:44:19,163 --> 00:44:21,268
Just tell me where my son is.

586
00:44:21,978 --> 00:44:23,124
I'll help you.

587
00:44:23,195 --> 00:44:26,642
I don't need your help,
and I can tell you still don't understand.

588
00:44:27,195 --> 00:44:30,642
Those who don't appreciate life
do not deserve life.

589
00:44:31,162 --> 00:44:33,301
My son appreciates his life.

590
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:37,561
But do you appreciate yours?
Do you appreciate your son's?

591
00:44:37,626 --> 00:44:39,382
Oh, this is shit!

592
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:42,393
Don't forget the rules

593
00:44:44,187 --> 00:44:46,358
if you wanna find your son.

594
00:44:49,115 --> 00:44:50,576
Where are you?

595
00:44:51,803 --> 00:44:54,192
No. No, we don't have 15 minutes.

596
00:44:54,266 --> 00:44:56,917
We need that location to the video feed.

597
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:12,503
Hey. I don't think we should stop, okay?

598
00:45:14,043 --> 00:45:15,865
Laura, can you hear me?

599
00:45:18,395 --> 00:45:21,941
That's the second time
I've had to wake up in this shithole.

600
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:24,915
Think you can stand up?

601
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:28,337
Yeah, but I don't really want to.

602
00:45:29,434 --> 00:45:31,474
There's so much left to do.

603
00:45:33,018 --> 00:45:35,222
So many people left to talk to.

604
00:45:38,266 --> 00:45:39,859
This can't be it.

605
00:45:45,371 --> 00:45:46,581
It's not.

606
00:45:53,434 --> 00:45:56,631
- Amanda, you said you survived this, right?
- I what?

607
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:00,309
This guy, whoever's doing it,

608
00:46:00,379 --> 00:46:03,194
you said that you've played before
and you survived.

609
00:46:03,259 --> 00:46:04,503
Yeah.

610
00:46:05,115 --> 00:46:07,318
So that means we could survive.

611
00:46:09,082 --> 00:46:10,292
Yeah.

612
00:46:11,162 --> 00:46:13,267
Wait. Amanda, why did he pick you?

613
00:46:14,682 --> 00:46:16,951
Because I was a fucking junkie.

614
00:46:25,275 --> 00:46:28,504
And the funny thing is,
I passed his little test.

615
00:46:30,395 --> 00:46:33,526
If you passed his test,
then why are you back here?

616
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:38,004
<i>I wasn't being very good to myself.</i>

617
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:48,608
How long have you...

618
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:50,802
I started in jail.

619
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:55,260
- What were you arrested for?
- Possession.

620
00:46:56,638 --> 00:46:58,264
But I thought you said that...

621
00:46:58,335 --> 00:47:01,401
Maybe you should talk
to the cop who arrested me.

622
00:47:03,806 --> 00:47:06,588
I'm guessing
you've never been arrested before.

623
00:47:06,654 --> 00:47:07,832
No.

624
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:12,154
I mean, I've been in trouble a few times,
you know, in and out of stuff.

625
00:47:12,223 --> 00:47:13,629
My dad's a...

626
00:47:17,822 --> 00:47:19,578
He's a real hardass.

627
00:47:21,502 --> 00:47:24,633
You know, he's probably got half the city
right now looking for me

628
00:47:24,703 --> 00:47:27,637
just so he can kick my ass
for disappearing on him.

629
00:47:28,799 --> 00:47:30,108
Yeah.

630
00:47:30,558 --> 00:47:31,933
Probably.

631
00:47:38,014 --> 00:47:41,080
We found a door. Come on.

632
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,805
Come on. We have to go.

633
00:47:48,415 --> 00:47:51,960
It's the only one without a lock,
but we can't get it open.

634
00:48:06,302 --> 00:48:08,790
- How's it going?
- It's stuck on something.

635
00:48:08,862 --> 00:48:10,073
Oh, shit.

636
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:13,883
- Here, let me try. Move, move! Come on.
- Will you take it easy? Jesus!

637
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:15,608
Just back up, all right?

638
00:48:30,526 --> 00:48:32,534
If it's stuck, it's a trap.

639
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:34,714
Lady, this whole house is a trap.

640
00:48:34,782 --> 00:48:38,044
Obviously someone didn't want us
to get into this room.

641
00:49:03,118 --> 00:49:04,874
- Now what?
- I'm gonna be right back, okay?

642
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:08,139
Whatever we do, we got
three minutes to get it done.

643
00:49:25,102 --> 00:49:27,972
<i>Hello, Xavier. I want to play a game.</i>

644
00:49:28,334 --> 00:49:31,563
<i>The game I want to play is very similar</i>

645
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:35,046
<i>to the one that you've been playing
as a drug dealer.</i>

646
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:39,532
<i>The game of offering hope to the desperate
for a price.</i>

647
00:49:39,823 --> 00:49:43,118
<i>I think we can agree
that your situation is desperate.</i>

648
00:49:43,534 --> 00:49:45,356
<i>So I offer you hope.</i>

649
00:49:45,422 --> 00:49:49,962
<i>The price you pay is that you must crawl
into the same pit of squalor</i>

650
00:49:50,031 --> 00:49:52,300
<i>you force your customers into.</i>

651
00:49:52,974 --> 00:49:54,632
<i>- By entering this room...
- Oh, my God.</i>

652
00:49:54,702 --> 00:49:56,328
<i>...a timer has been started.</i>

653
00:49:56,526 --> 00:50:00,171
<i>When the timer expires, the door
in front of you will be locked forever.</i>

654
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:02,148
<i>- Only in finding the key...</i>
- Guys? Guys.

655
00:50:02,222 --> 00:50:03,531
- What?
- Look.

656
00:50:03,598 --> 00:50:06,216
<i>...before the timer runs out
can you unlock it</i>

657
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:08,877
<i>and retrieve the antidote inside.</i>

658
00:50:08,942 --> 00:50:12,903
<i>I will give you just one hint
as to where that key is.</i>

659
00:50:19,278 --> 00:50:22,213
<i>It will be like finding a needle
in a haystack.</i>

660
00:50:24,078 --> 00:50:25,834
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

661
00:50:27,278 --> 00:50:29,220
Somebody's going in there.

662
00:50:29,647 --> 00:50:32,297
Now, look, somebody's fucking
going in there, man.

663
00:50:37,038 --> 00:50:38,118
No! No! No!

664
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:39,783
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck are you doing?

665
00:50:39,855 --> 00:50:41,742
- Stop.
- What are you doing?

666
00:50:41,806 --> 00:50:43,367
- No! No!
- What the fuck are you doing?

667
00:50:43,439 --> 00:50:45,381
- No! No! Please!
- Let her go now.

668
00:50:45,454 --> 00:50:46,567
No!

669
00:50:48,014 --> 00:50:49,061
Shit!

670
00:50:53,162 --> 00:50:54,340
My God.

671
00:50:54,411 --> 00:50:55,817
Come on!

672
00:50:56,222 --> 00:50:58,644
- We don't have time!
- Oh, shit.

673
00:51:02,602 --> 00:51:04,806
What the fuck's wrong with you?

674
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,821
What are you doing?

675
00:51:07,082 --> 00:51:09,951
- You're out of your fucking mind.
- Hurry up.

676
00:51:10,922 --> 00:51:12,198
Oh, shit!

677
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:14,028
Come on!

678
00:51:15,122 --> 00:51:16,780
We don't have time.

679
00:51:20,635 --> 00:51:22,391
Keep fucking looking.

680
00:51:23,946 --> 00:51:26,150
- Come on! Come on!
- Fuck you!

681
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:29,731
What the fuck?

682
00:51:37,738 --> 00:51:39,396
Someone's gotta help her.

683
00:51:40,234 --> 00:51:41,957
What the fuck, guys?

684
00:51:45,566 --> 00:51:46,566
Fuck!

685
00:52:04,998 --> 00:52:07,070
No. No. No. No.

686
00:52:07,654 --> 00:52:09,061
No!

687
00:52:09,382 --> 00:52:10,909
No. No!

688
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:14,367
Come on.

689
00:52:15,014 --> 00:52:16,421
No, no, no.

690
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,639
- You fucking bitch!
- All right. That's enough.

691
00:52:37,714 --> 00:52:39,885
That's not nearly enough, man.

692
00:52:39,954 --> 00:52:41,612
Stop this bullshit.

693
00:52:44,114 --> 00:52:45,937
Did you hear that tape?

694
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:51,185
He knows about us. Our names.

695
00:52:51,858 --> 00:52:54,345
There's something that we're not seeing.

696
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:55,817
Jail.

697
00:52:57,938 --> 00:53:00,272
You said you three had been there.

698
00:53:01,298 --> 00:53:02,705
Make it four.

699
00:53:05,102 --> 00:53:07,687
- For what?
- Doesn't matter.

700
00:53:08,782 --> 00:53:10,822
Anybody else wanna own up?

701
00:53:12,142 --> 00:53:15,175
What about you?
You got juvie written all over you.

702
00:53:15,598 --> 00:53:17,256
No, never been.

703
00:53:17,806 --> 00:53:19,082
All right.

704
00:53:19,502 --> 00:53:21,444
- Let's talk this out.
- No.

705
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:23,525
No more talking.

706
00:53:23,726 --> 00:53:27,304
The only thing you people have in common
is holding me back.

707
00:53:28,814 --> 00:53:30,058
I'm gone.

708
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:52,361
- Where is this goddamn tech team?
- They'll be here any second.

709
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:53,991
I'm not listening to this anymore.

710
00:53:54,061 --> 00:53:57,891
- Another second is too fucking long.
- Look, I know how this guy works, okay?

711
00:53:57,966 --> 00:53:59,275
He's playing a game.

712
00:53:59,342 --> 00:54:01,317
Eric just needs to stay in it
a little bit longer.

713
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:03,299
Take a look at the clock.

714
00:54:05,006 --> 00:54:08,716
You need to start thinking outside the box,
or his son is gonna end up in one.

715
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:16,202
His work.

716
00:54:17,709 --> 00:54:19,749
You wanna get to him, that's how you do it.

717
00:54:20,334 --> 00:54:22,157
I mean, he's relishing this.

718
00:54:22,222 --> 00:54:25,156
It's an opportunity to be heard,
to be studied.

719
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:27,335
Threaten to destroy his work.

720
00:54:53,222 --> 00:54:56,157
How will you get your conviction
without all this evidence, Eric?

721
00:54:56,229 --> 00:54:57,920
I don't need this shit to convict you.

722
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:00,412
So go ahead. Destroy it.

723
00:55:00,486 --> 00:55:02,395
- I will.
- Destroy it all.

724
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:07,485
Just know it will not save your son
if you do.

725
00:55:07,558 --> 00:55:09,052
You kill my son, I kill you.

726
00:55:09,126 --> 00:55:10,370
Go ahead.

727
00:55:10,726 --> 00:55:14,141
Why wait? We both know
the sort of person you are, sir.

728
00:55:14,214 --> 00:55:15,676
- Get out of here.
- The sort of person

729
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:18,270
who guns down an unarmed suspect.

730
00:55:18,342 --> 00:55:21,025
In fact,
the sort of person who plants evidence

731
00:55:21,094 --> 00:55:23,199
in order to obtain a conviction.

732
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:26,947
The sort of person whose wife leaves him
and whose son hates him.

733
00:55:27,014 --> 00:55:28,607
Shut the fuck up!

734
00:55:30,662 --> 00:55:33,379
- Okay, set up all the traces to the satellite.
- Let's go.

735
00:55:35,046 --> 00:55:36,955
Your tech team's arrived.

736
00:55:38,022 --> 00:55:39,428
Just in time.

737
00:55:40,645 --> 00:55:43,744
You better hope
they find the source of that feed.

738
00:55:46,438 --> 00:55:47,867
There's something I haven't told you, Eric.

739
00:55:47,942 --> 00:55:49,218
I'm done listening to you.

740
00:55:49,285 --> 00:55:51,009
Maybe I can just show it to you.

741
00:55:51,078 --> 00:55:53,671
But, unfortunately, it's going to be difficult
for me to get it myself,

742
00:55:53,733 --> 00:55:57,662
so perhaps you could ask the people
who are listening on that walkie in there

743
00:55:57,734 --> 00:55:59,522
if they could get it for me, all right?

744
00:56:01,286 --> 00:56:02,530
Brown desk.

745
00:56:02,598 --> 00:56:04,289
<i>Second drawer down.</i>

746
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:13,757
You may not remember all those people,

747
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:15,969
<i>but I'm sure they remember you.</i>

748
00:56:17,414 --> 00:56:20,381
<i>You were the arresting officer
in all of their cases,</i>

749
00:56:20,454 --> 00:56:22,843
<i>and you were the one
who planted all the evidence</i>

750
00:56:22,918 --> 00:56:25,187
<i>used to obtain their convictions.</i>

751
00:56:25,254 --> 00:56:27,393
<i>You were the one who put them away.</i>

752
00:56:27,462 --> 00:56:28,956
<i>Your son is playing a game</i>

753
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:32,346
<i>with a lot of people who don't
like you very much, Detective.</i>

754
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:36,481
<i>It would be a shame
if they discovered who he was.</i>

755
00:57:28,766 --> 00:57:31,548
<i>You all possess
the combination to the safe.</i>

756
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:35,192
<i>Think hard.
The numbers are in the back of your mind.</i>

757
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:39,345
<i>The clue to their order can be found
over the rainbow.</i>

758
00:57:39,417 --> 00:57:41,076
Son of a bitch.

759
00:57:58,849 --> 00:58:01,915
- What are you doing?
- I haven't decided yet.

760
00:58:03,138 --> 00:58:05,953
You know, the others,
they're scared of you.

761
00:58:06,562 --> 00:58:07,609
Good.

762
00:58:10,146 --> 00:58:11,487
You and me,

763
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:15,065
we can keep going at each other
like we're back in the yard,

764
00:58:15,138 --> 00:58:18,815
or we can come together
and figure out who's doing this to us.

765
00:58:18,946 --> 00:58:21,564
You and the others can do what you want.

766
00:58:22,178 --> 00:58:24,666
I already found what I'm looking for.

767
00:58:28,673 --> 00:58:30,364
You remind me of me.

768
00:58:30,498 --> 00:58:32,767
No matter
what kind of fucked-up situation you're in,

769
00:58:32,834 --> 00:58:35,255
you always gotta find yourself an enemy.

770
00:58:35,393 --> 00:58:37,914
You know what? I got enemies, man.

771
00:58:39,073 --> 00:58:41,408
Outside these fucking walls, bro.

772
00:58:42,913 --> 00:58:44,953
And they're looking for me.

773
00:58:45,122 --> 00:58:49,246
And if they don't find me,
they're going after the ones closest to me.

774
00:58:49,537 --> 00:58:50,846
My family.

775
00:58:52,642 --> 00:58:54,103
You understand?

776
00:58:55,106 --> 00:58:56,120
No.

777
00:58:57,121 --> 00:58:58,812
I don't understand.

778
00:59:00,066 --> 00:59:02,848
It's just me, and that's the way I like it.

779
00:59:03,394 --> 00:59:05,663
Now, turn around.

780
00:59:06,786 --> 00:59:09,884
- What?
- Turn around.

781
01:00:26,018 --> 01:00:27,228
Oh, shit.

782
01:00:27,842 --> 01:00:30,427
- No. We can't stop.
- Shit.

783
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:34,717
Oh, my God.

784
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:39,261
We've been here for two hours.
If what that tape says is true,

785
01:00:39,329 --> 01:00:41,817
then in one hour, the front door will open.

786
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:43,548
We're not gonna make it that long.

787
01:00:43,617 --> 01:00:45,177
That's a real winning attitude.

788
01:00:45,249 --> 01:00:46,493
She knows what she's talking about.

789
01:00:46,561 --> 01:00:47,805
Oh, yeah?

790
01:00:48,065 --> 01:00:49,723
"X" marks the spot.

791
01:00:50,337 --> 01:00:51,417
What?

792
01:00:51,713 --> 01:00:53,240
"X" marks...

793
01:00:53,794 --> 01:00:55,200
Marks the spot.

794
01:00:55,266 --> 01:00:56,924
There's the answer.

795
01:01:06,113 --> 01:01:08,153
What are you doing with him?

796
01:01:10,113 --> 01:01:11,804
This is your father?

797
01:01:12,033 --> 01:01:13,976
- What? You know him?
- Yeah.

798
01:01:14,882 --> 01:01:17,599
He's the guy who put me away.
He set me up.

799
01:01:21,858 --> 01:01:24,062
Tell me that's not your father.

800
01:01:34,106 --> 01:01:35,829
It's okay. It's okay.

801
01:01:55,841 --> 01:01:57,750
I can't trust any of you.

802
01:02:01,954 --> 01:02:03,863
You two are on your own.

803
01:02:09,285 --> 01:02:11,707
Now we know what we have in common.

804
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:14,368
Amanda, please. I didn't know.

805
01:02:15,526 --> 01:02:17,762
<i>Hey, kid! Amanda!</i>

806
01:02:18,277 --> 01:02:19,706
Where are you?

807
01:02:23,174 --> 01:02:24,996
Please don't leave me.

808
01:02:50,181 --> 01:02:51,643
We gotta move.

809
01:02:57,445 --> 01:02:58,689
Hey, kid!

810
01:02:59,813 --> 01:03:00,958
<i>Amanda!</i>

811
01:03:01,606 --> 01:03:03,231
<i>I found a way out.</i>

812
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:18,590
Eight.

813
01:03:46,821 --> 01:03:48,032
Hey, kid!

814
01:03:55,493 --> 01:03:59,486
Do not run.

815
01:04:26,277 --> 01:04:28,001
Eric. Eric.

816
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:29,280
No! Stop!

817
01:04:29,701 --> 01:04:31,163
Get off of me!

818
01:04:32,006 --> 01:04:33,729
We tried it your way.

819
01:04:38,726 --> 01:04:40,864
You motherfucker! Where is he?

820
01:04:43,397 --> 01:04:44,444
Eric.

821
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:52,983
Damn it.

822
01:04:56,149 --> 01:04:59,532
I'd like to go now
until your son is pissing blood.

823
01:05:14,006 --> 01:05:17,005
Now, that's the Eric Matthews
they gave medals to.

824
01:06:02,405 --> 01:06:04,128
Help!

825
01:06:05,373 --> 01:06:06,966
<i>Please, help me!</i>

826
01:06:10,697 --> 01:06:12,038
Oh, my God.

827
01:06:12,393 --> 01:06:13,506
Jonas.

828
01:06:15,113 --> 01:06:17,961
Help me! Help me!

829
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:24,035
Help!

830
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:41,588
Please.

831
01:06:42,321 --> 01:06:43,662
It's okay.

832
01:06:43,730 --> 01:06:45,486
- Help me.
- It's okay.

833
01:06:50,417 --> 01:06:52,173
No. No.

834
01:06:54,321 --> 01:06:56,110
No!

835
01:06:56,369 --> 01:06:57,546
Fucker!

836
01:07:09,521 --> 01:07:12,041
No!

837
01:07:18,614 --> 01:07:19,759
Amanda.

838
01:07:27,989 --> 01:07:30,411
Nobody's listening anymore, asshole.

839
01:07:34,485 --> 01:07:37,583
Open your mouth. Open your mouth!
Come on.

840
01:07:37,814 --> 01:07:38,959
There you go.

841
01:07:39,029 --> 01:07:41,614
You gonna tell me where he is now, huh?

842
01:07:42,357 --> 01:07:43,357
What?

843
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:46,890
Say it again.

844
01:07:49,173 --> 01:07:50,700
Game over.

845
01:07:51,797 --> 01:07:53,837
I'll take you to the house.

846
01:07:55,477 --> 01:07:58,194
You're gonna take me right now.
Right now.

847
01:07:58,613 --> 01:08:00,468
I will only take you.

848
01:08:01,845 --> 01:08:03,187
No one else.

849
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:09,459
All right. Just me and you.

850
01:08:10,549 --> 01:08:14,706
- How do we get out of here?
- There's a button on the wall.

851
01:08:15,221 --> 01:08:16,781
You'd better hurry.

852
01:08:18,357 --> 01:08:20,364
There's not much time left.

853
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:42,091
- The elevator!
- Come on!

854
01:08:43,253 --> 01:08:44,253
Fuck!

855
01:08:44,533 --> 01:08:46,475
Secure the warehouse now!

856
01:08:48,309 --> 01:08:50,894
- All right, let's go! Go! Go, go, go!
- Damn it.

857
01:08:52,565 --> 01:08:54,125
We've got a lock.

858
01:08:54,677 --> 01:08:57,011
This is Kerry. They're both gone.

859
01:09:03,317 --> 01:09:06,034
If I don't find my son, I swear to God...

860
01:09:08,981 --> 01:09:10,672
<i>Kerry, they're gone.</i>

861
01:09:10,965 --> 01:09:12,372
<i>Fucking gone.</i>

862
01:09:15,221 --> 01:09:18,385
Yes! Kerry. We got a lock.
We got a lock on the house.

863
01:09:18,453 --> 01:09:19,947
- Rigg, we got it.
- What?

864
01:09:20,021 --> 01:09:21,428
<i>237 North Hyde Crescent.</i>

865
01:09:21,493 --> 01:09:23,981
<i>- That's North Hyde Crescent.
- 237 North Hyde Crescent. Got it.</i>

866
01:09:27,893 --> 01:09:29,322
Where to now?

867
01:09:31,445 --> 01:09:32,907
Straight ahead.

868
01:09:37,685 --> 01:09:40,205
Come on, come on. Where are you?

869
01:09:42,037 --> 01:09:43,859
Make a right on Alfred.

870
01:09:51,381 --> 01:09:53,203
Open the fucking door!

871
01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:55,411
Open the door!

872
01:09:55,477 --> 01:09:57,299
There's nowhere to go.

873
01:09:57,749 --> 01:10:00,848
All I want is the number
on the back of your head.

874
01:10:04,693 --> 01:10:07,214
There's nowhere to go! Come on, Amanda!

875
01:10:07,285 --> 01:10:08,812
I can't hold it.

876
01:10:11,445 --> 01:10:12,907
Come on! Let me in!

877
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:14,257
Let me in!

878
01:10:19,765 --> 01:10:21,456
Open the door! Come on!

879
01:10:21,525 --> 01:10:22,735
What do we do?

880
01:10:22,805 --> 01:10:25,009
Take a left at the next street.

881
01:10:27,221 --> 01:10:29,294
It's the last house on the left.

882
01:10:29,845 --> 01:10:31,056
Oh, shit.

883
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:33,484
Shit!

884
01:10:34,389 --> 01:10:35,567
Come on!

885
01:10:37,109 --> 01:10:38,669
Come on, Amanda!

886
01:10:39,093 --> 01:10:41,908
- Amanda, what is it?
- It's a door.

887
01:10:42,453 --> 01:10:43,697
It's a fucking door.

888
01:10:43,765 --> 01:10:46,699
You have nowhere to go!
You have nowhere to go!

889
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:53,326
Come on!

890
01:10:53,397 --> 01:10:55,285
Help me move this thing.

891
01:11:00,437 --> 01:11:02,259
I'm not gonna hurt you.

892
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,556
Come on, Amanda!

893
01:11:08,821 --> 01:11:10,097
Shit, it's locked!

894
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:11,474
Let me in!

895
01:11:12,661 --> 01:11:14,570
Come on, open the door!

896
01:11:15,349 --> 01:11:16,349
Come on!

897
01:11:16,853 --> 01:11:19,089
The key.
The one we found with the tape recorder.

898
01:11:19,157 --> 01:11:20,848
Where is it? Where is it?

899
01:11:20,917 --> 01:11:21,964
Fuck!

900
01:11:22,197 --> 01:11:23,953
Jonas. Jonas had it last.

901
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:26,835
- Come on, Amanda!
- Find it! Hurry!

902
01:11:27,605 --> 01:11:28,783
Come on!

903
01:11:34,101 --> 01:11:35,628
Come on, open the door!

904
01:11:35,701 --> 01:11:36,977
Let me in!

905
01:11:43,413 --> 01:11:48,148
Eric, you're gonna need this key
when you get inside the house.

906
01:12:16,757 --> 01:12:18,546
Where the hell are we?

907
01:12:20,564 --> 01:12:22,474
Run! Run!

908
01:12:33,013 --> 01:12:34,190
Daniel?

909
01:12:39,445 --> 01:12:40,623
Daniel!

910
01:12:41,717 --> 01:12:43,539
Daniel, we gotta go!

911
01:12:43,604 --> 01:12:45,808
- We gotta go! Come on!
- Run.

912
01:12:53,109 --> 01:12:55,978
All right, come on.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

913
01:12:56,053 --> 01:12:57,394
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

914
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:16,466
Go, go, go!

915
01:13:16,948 --> 01:13:18,956
- Hallway's clear.
- We're in.

916
01:13:19,573 --> 01:13:20,718
Daniel!

917
01:13:21,173 --> 01:13:23,988
- The ground floor is secure.
- Moving up. Moving up.

918
01:13:24,053 --> 01:13:26,573
<i>Kerry, we're in the house.
I repeat, we're in the house.</i>

919
01:13:26,645 --> 01:13:29,580
Cannot see you, Sergeant.
Repeat, cannot see you.

920
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:33,458
Repeat. I cannot see you.

921
01:13:33,524 --> 01:13:35,663
<i>- Where the hell is everybody?</i>
- What is your 20?

922
01:13:35,733 --> 01:13:37,326
<i>Rigg, do you copy?</i>

923
01:14:03,093 --> 01:14:04,686
<i>Hello, Mr. Hindle.</i>

924
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,861
<i>Follow your heart.</i>

925
01:14:06,933 --> 01:14:08,362
<i>I really wish I had checked in there first.</i>

926
01:14:08,436 --> 01:14:10,225
<i>What the fuck is this?</i>

927
01:14:10,773 --> 01:14:13,707
<i>My name is very fucking confused.
What's your name?</i>

928
01:14:13,781 --> 01:14:15,668
<i>I'm gonna kill your husband now,
Mrs. Gordon.</i>

929
01:14:15,733 --> 01:14:17,642
<i>He doesn't want us
to cut through our chains.</i>

930
01:14:17,717 --> 01:14:19,789
<i>What are you doing to me? No!</i>

931
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:21,005
<i>He wants us to cut through our feet.</i>

932
01:14:21,076 --> 01:14:22,571
<i>No! Oh, my God!</i>

933
01:14:24,021 --> 01:14:25,101
<i>It hurts!</i>

934
01:14:27,093 --> 01:14:28,107
<i>No!</i>

935
01:14:47,188 --> 01:14:48,715
Daniel!

936
01:14:56,277 --> 01:14:58,644
Daniel, no. Don't leave me.

937
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:02,125
Please.

938
01:15:12,117 --> 01:15:13,393
He's gone.

939
01:15:14,773 --> 01:15:15,951
Doesn't matter.

940
01:15:16,117 --> 01:15:18,637
All I want is the number
on the back of his neck.

941
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:20,171
And then yours.

942
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,613
You still don't know your own number.

943
01:15:25,685 --> 01:15:28,587
How are you gonna
get it if I don't tell you?

944
01:15:55,925 --> 01:15:57,070
Daniel!

945
01:16:20,149 --> 01:16:21,149
Shit.

946
01:16:52,852 --> 01:16:53,899
Fuck.

947
01:17:03,817 --> 01:17:04,994
Daniel?

948
01:17:07,728 --> 01:17:10,030
I still cannot see you, Sergeant.

949
01:17:10,289 --> 01:17:11,882
Rigg, do you copy?

950
01:17:15,537 --> 01:17:17,479
- Left side clear.
- Right side clear.

951
01:17:17,553 --> 01:17:18,862
All clear.

952
01:17:20,337 --> 01:17:24,330
<i>I still can't see you, Sergeant.
I repeat, cannot see you.</i>

953
01:17:46,833 --> 01:17:48,109
It's not live.

954
01:17:48,368 --> 01:17:50,059
Kerry, we're in the wrong fucking house!

955
01:17:50,128 --> 01:17:52,550
<i>They've been dead this whole fucking time.</i>

956
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:54,107
<i>- Get your team out of there.</i>
- Let's go.

957
01:17:55,665 --> 01:17:56,842
Daniel?

958
01:18:16,017 --> 01:18:17,162
Daniel?

959
01:18:31,824 --> 01:18:32,969
Daniel?

960
01:18:37,905 --> 01:18:39,050
Daniel.

961
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,531
Daniel.

962
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:36,783
<i>Hello, Eric.
You probably don't even remember me,</i>

963
01:20:37,201 --> 01:20:39,306
<i>but you changed my life once.</i>

964
01:20:40,177 --> 01:20:41,999
<i>You sent me to prison.</i>

965
01:20:42,192 --> 01:20:44,462
<i>I was guilty of a lot of things,</i>

966
01:20:44,912 --> 01:20:47,662
<i>but not the drug charge you framed me for.</i>

967
01:20:48,496 --> 01:20:52,206
<i>You wouldn't know the things you lose
when you're locked away.</i>

968
01:20:52,368 --> 01:20:57,037
<i>The second time
somebody changed my life, I was guilty.</i>

969
01:20:57,105 --> 01:20:58,534
<i>Hello, Amanda.</i>

970
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,782
<i>But my life was saved that day.</i>

971
01:21:00,849 --> 01:21:02,987
- You said you survived this, right?
- Yeah.

972
01:21:04,464 --> 01:21:09,221
<i>I found myself a father,
a leader, a teacher.</i>

973
01:21:09,712 --> 01:21:11,468
You must meet death

974
01:21:12,113 --> 01:21:13,901
in order to be reborn.

975
01:21:15,249 --> 01:21:16,874
He helped me.

976
01:21:16,944 --> 01:21:19,279
<i>What is the cure for cancer, Eric?</i>

977
01:21:19,345 --> 01:21:22,574
Those who don't appreciate life
do not deserve life.

978
01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:25,417
<i>The cure for death itself?</i>

979
01:21:25,488 --> 01:21:28,107
<i>The answer is immortality.</i>

980
01:21:29,328 --> 01:21:31,433
Daniel!

981
01:21:33,616 --> 01:21:35,405
<i>By creating a legacy,</i>

982
01:21:36,144 --> 01:21:40,334
<i>by living a life worth remembering,
you become immortal.</i>

983
01:21:40,817 --> 01:21:43,981
<i>So now you find the tables are turned.</i>

984
01:21:44,049 --> 01:21:45,259
He asked for you.

985
01:21:45,328 --> 01:21:46,757
- What the fuck do you want?
- I told you.

986
01:21:46,833 --> 01:21:48,043
He wants us to survive this.

987
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:49,639
I want to play a game.

988
01:21:49,936 --> 01:21:51,594
You have to play by the fucking rules!

989
01:21:51,664 --> 01:21:52,777
The rules are simple.

990
01:21:52,848 --> 01:21:54,515
All you have to do is sit here
and talk to me.

991
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:55,524
What?

992
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,837
If you can do that long enough,
you will find your son

993
01:21:57,904 --> 01:21:59,049
in a safe and secure state.

994
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,200
What the fuck is that?

995
01:22:00,273 --> 01:22:01,963
It's your son, Daniel.
You remember him, don't you?

996
01:22:02,033 --> 01:22:03,033
My dad's a...

997
01:22:03,088 --> 01:22:04,103
He's a real hardass.

998
01:22:04,176 --> 01:22:05,354
<i>I call you unworthy</i>

999
01:22:05,425 --> 01:22:07,312
<i>of the life that you've been given.</i>

1000
01:22:07,376 --> 01:22:09,351
<i>The knowledge
of your son's impending death</i>

1001
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:11,464
<i>has caused you to forgive all his sins.</i>

1002
01:22:11,537 --> 01:22:14,384
Why is that we're only willing to do that
when a life is at stake?

1003
01:22:14,448 --> 01:22:15,463
Daniel!

1004
01:22:15,536 --> 01:22:16,536
I'm done listening to you.

1005
01:22:16,593 --> 01:22:17,593
Don't forget the rules.

1006
01:22:17,649 --> 01:22:18,597
Shut the fuck up!

1007
01:22:18,672 --> 01:22:19,620
He's playing a game.

1008
01:22:19,696 --> 01:22:20,645
I don't wanna talk to him.

1009
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:21,735
You're not saying shit.

1010
01:22:21,808 --> 01:22:23,290
We both know the sort of person you are.

1011
01:22:23,376 --> 01:22:25,547
I'd like to go now
until your son is pissing...

1012
01:22:26,672 --> 01:22:28,330
I'll take you to the house.

1013
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:29,677
Daniel?

1014
01:22:31,248 --> 01:22:33,255
There's something I haven't told you, Eric.

1015
01:22:33,808 --> 01:22:37,354
<i>It is I who will carry on John's work
after he dies.</i>

1016
01:22:37,424 --> 01:22:38,951
Daniel!

1017
01:22:39,025 --> 01:22:41,927
So go ahead. Destroy it.

1018
01:22:42,001 --> 01:22:43,211
<i>And you...</i>

1019
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,280
Daniel!

1020
01:22:44,336 --> 01:22:47,053
<i>...are my first test subject.</i>

1021
01:22:47,472 --> 01:22:49,447
<i>Now you are locked away,</i>

1022
01:22:49,681 --> 01:22:52,136
<i>helpless and alone.</i>

1023
01:22:55,856 --> 01:22:57,040
You fucking bitch.

1024
01:22:57,271 --> 01:22:58,336
Game over.

1025
01:22:58,608 --> 01:23:00,550
I'll fucking kill you!

1026
01:23:01,168 --> 01:23:02,990
You fucking bitch!

1027
01:23:03,664 --> 01:23:05,769
<i>You fucking bitch!</i>

1028
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,349
<i>I'll fucking kill you!</i>

1029
01:23:10,064 --> 01:23:11,209
<i>No!</i>

1030
01:23:16,272 --> 01:23:17,865
<i>No!</i>
