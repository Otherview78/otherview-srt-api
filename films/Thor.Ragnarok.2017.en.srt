1
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,370
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

2
00:00:57,537 --> 00:01:00,915
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"

3
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:02,834
Well, sometimes
you have to get captured

4
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,586
just to get a straight answer
out of somebody.

5
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:07,171
It's a long story,

6
00:01:07,255 --> 00:01:09,215
but basically,
I'm a bit of a hero.

7
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:12,969
See, I spent some time
on Earth...

8
00:01:13,428 --> 00:01:14,596
fought some robots,

9
00:01:14,679 --> 00:01:16,306
saved the planet
a couple of times.

10
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:18,349
Then I went searching
through the cosmos

11
00:01:18,558 --> 00:01:21,477
for some magic, colorful
Infinity Stone things.

12
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:24,772
Didn't find any.

13
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:26,149
That's when I came across

14
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:28,985
a path of death
and destruction...

15
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,863
which led me all the way here
into this cage...

16
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:34,824
where I met you.

17
00:01:38,828 --> 00:01:40,079
Hmm.

18
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:42,665
How much longer do you think
we'll be here?

19
00:01:56,721 --> 00:02:00,308
Thor, son of Odin.

20
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:04,228
Surtur, son of a bitch.

21
00:02:04,312 --> 00:02:05,313
You're still alive.

22
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:09,817
I thought my father killed you
a half a million years ago.

23
00:02:09,984 --> 00:02:11,611
I cannot die.

24
00:02:11,778 --> 00:02:13,529
Not until
I fulfill my destiny...

25
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:15,948
and lay waste to your home.

26
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,617
It's funny
you should mention that.

27
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:20,078
Because I've been having these
terrible dreams of late.

28
00:02:20,244 --> 00:02:22,497
Asgard up in flames,
falling to ruins.

29
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:23,873
And you, Surtur,

30
00:02:23,956 --> 00:02:25,458
are at the center
of all of them.

31
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,462
Then you have seen Ragnarok,
the fall of Asgard.

32
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:31,464
- The great prophecy...
- Hang on.

33
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:34,342
Hang on.

34
00:02:34,425 --> 00:02:37,136
I'll be back around shortly.

35
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:40,264
I really feel like we were
connecting there.

36
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:44,394
Okay, so Ragnarok.

37
00:02:44,477 --> 00:02:46,145
Tell me about that.
Walk me through it.

38
00:02:46,437 --> 00:02:48,314
My time has come.

39
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:51,609
When my crown is reunited
with the Eternal Flame...

40
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,445
I shall be restored
to my full might.

41
00:02:54,612 --> 00:02:56,864
I will tower
over the mountains...

42
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:59,617
and bury my sword
deep in Asgard's...

43
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:02,328
Oh, hang on.
Give it a second.

44
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,788
I swear I'm not even moving.

45
00:03:03,871 --> 00:03:05,415
It's just doing this
on its own.

46
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm really sorry.

47
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:09,877
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

48
00:03:10,044 --> 00:03:13,673
You're going to put your crown
into the Eternal Flame...

49
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,217
and then you'll suddenly grow
as big as a house?

50
00:03:16,384 --> 00:03:17,552
A mountain!

51
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:20,763
The Eternal Flame that Odin
keeps locked away on Asgard?

52
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,349
Odin is not on Asgard.

53
00:03:23,641 --> 00:03:27,562
And your absence has left
the throne defenseless.

54
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:29,564
Okay, so where is it?
This crown?

55
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:32,650
This is my crown,
the source of my power.

56
00:03:33,151 --> 00:03:34,652
Oh, that's a crown.

57
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:36,529
I thought it was
a big eyebrow.

58
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:37,864
It's a crown.

59
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,534
Anyway, it sounds like all I
have to do to stop Ragnarok...

60
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:43,411
is rip that thing
off your head.

61
00:03:43,703 --> 00:03:47,290
But Ragnarok
has already begun.

62
00:03:47,457 --> 00:03:49,250
You cannot stop it.

63
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:02,054
I am Asgard's doom,
and so are you.

64
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:05,808
All will suffer,
all will burn.

65
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:07,685
Oh, that's intense.

66
00:04:07,852 --> 00:04:09,687
To be honest,
seeing you grow really big...

67
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:12,356
and set fire to a planet
would be quite the spectacle.

68
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:15,193
But it looks like I'm gonna
have to choose option B...

69
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,111
where I bust
out of these chains...

70
00:04:17,278 --> 00:04:19,030
knock that tiara
off your head,

71
00:04:19,113 --> 00:04:21,115
and stash it away
in Asgard's vault.

72
00:04:21,324 --> 00:04:24,285
You cannot stop Ragnarok.

73
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:25,536
Why fight it?

74
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:29,397
Because that's what heroes do.

75
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:33,401
Hmm.

76
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:36,404
Wait, I'm sorry.
I didn't time that right.

77
00:04:36,738 --> 00:04:38,031
Hmm?

78
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:39,574
And, now!

79
00:04:44,204 --> 00:04:47,749
You have made
a grave mistake, Odinson.

80
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,460
I make grave mistakes
all the time.

81
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,173
Everything seems to work out.

82
00:05:58,278 --> 00:05:59,279
Huh?

83
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:15,545
Heimdall, I know
it's been a while,

84
00:06:15,628 --> 00:06:17,630
but I could really use
a fast exit.

85
00:06:19,132 --> 00:06:20,550
Heimdall?

86
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:23,428
Heimdall was an idiot.

87
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:25,555
This job should have
made him rich.

88
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:27,974
Now, the job ain't easy...

89
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:29,934
but it does have its benefits.

90
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:32,479
The Bifrost gives me
access to everything

91
00:06:32,562 --> 00:06:34,481
the Nine Realms has to offer.

92
00:06:34,647 --> 00:06:36,941
I mean it's all mine
for the taking.

93
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,611
Behold...

94
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:42,947
my stuff.

95
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:44,282
Ooh.

96
00:06:45,116 --> 00:06:46,951
I'm particularly fond
of these.

97
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:50,663
I pulled them out of a place
on Midgard called Texas.

98
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,875
I even named them.
Des and Troy.

99
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,086
You see,
when you put them together...

100
00:06:58,087 --> 00:06:59,130
they destroy.

101
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,151
Heimdall, come on.

102
00:07:40,463 --> 00:07:41,506
Stay!

103
00:07:43,258 --> 00:07:46,135
Heimdall?
I'm running short on options.

104
00:07:46,678 --> 00:07:48,888
<i>Heimdall?</i>

105
00:07:48,972 --> 00:07:50,390
Um... Skurge?

106
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,144
Is that important?

107
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:03,945
You girls
are in for a treat.

108
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,462
Girls!

109
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:03,717
Well, well, well.
Look who decided to pop in.

110
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,927
Thanks for scaring away
my company

111
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:07,679
and drenching my workplace
in brains.

112
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:08,972
Who are you?

113
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:10,807
Don't you remember?
I'm Skurge.

114
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:12,017
We fought together
on Vanaheim.

115
00:09:12,392 --> 00:09:14,519
Right. Where is Heimdall?

116
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:17,689
That traitor. No one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.

117
00:09:18,356 --> 00:09:19,483
Traitor?

118
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:21,151
Yeah. Well, you see,
Odin charged Heimdall

119
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:22,235
with negligence of duty...

120
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:24,321
but he disappeared
before the trial.

121
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:25,614
Hard to catch a guy

122
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:26,698
who can see
everything in the universe.

123
00:09:26,782 --> 00:09:27,783
Sure.

124
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:30,410
Hold on. I'm supposed
to announce your arrival.

125
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:56,186
What the hell is that?

126
00:10:04,152 --> 00:10:06,863
Oh, brother.
This is it.

127
00:10:07,155 --> 00:10:08,406
I take my leave.

128
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:11,284
You fool,
you didn't listen!

129
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:12,577
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:13,787
Lady Sif, get help!

131
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,871
Somebody, help!

132
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:17,207
Sorry
for all I've done.

133
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:19,125
Shh. It's all right. Hold on.

134
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:22,712
I'm sorry
I tried to rule Earth.

135
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:24,214
They'd be lucky to have you.

136
00:10:24,506 --> 00:10:27,217
I'm sorry about that thing
with the Tesseract.

137
00:10:27,676 --> 00:10:29,177
- I just couldn't help myself.
- I know.

138
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:30,554
I'm a trickster.

139
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:32,556
So mischievous.

140
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:35,433
Sorry about that time
I turned you into a frog.

141
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:37,018
It was a wonderful joke.

142
00:10:37,394 --> 00:10:39,312
'Twas indeed hilarious.

143
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:41,565
You are the savior
of Asgard.

144
00:10:41,982 --> 00:10:43,900
- Tell my story.
- I will.

145
00:10:43,984 --> 00:10:45,110
Build a statue for me.

146
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:46,987
We will build
a big statue for you.

147
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,031
With my helmet on,
with the big bendy horns.

148
00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:53,159
I will tell Father
what you did here today.

149
00:10:53,702 --> 00:10:54,995
I didn't do it for him.

150
00:10:56,037 --> 00:10:58,832
I didn't do it for him.

151
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:09,759
No!

152
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:16,182
And so,
Loki died of his wounds...

153
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:18,268
giving his life for ours.

154
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,104
He fought back
those disgusting elves...

155
00:11:21,396 --> 00:11:23,064
he brought peace to the realm.

156
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:25,525
Loki, my boy...

157
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,986
'twas many moons ago
I found you

158
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:30,030
on that
frostbitten battlefield.

159
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:33,283
On that day,
I did not yet see in you...

160
00:11:33,575 --> 00:11:35,744
Asgard's savior. No.

161
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:40,415
You were merely
a little blue baby icicle...

162
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,419
that melted
this old fool's heart.

163
00:11:46,796 --> 00:11:49,382
Bravo! Bravo!
Well done. Bravo.

164
00:11:54,137 --> 00:11:55,138
Father.

165
00:11:56,222 --> 00:11:57,223
Oh, shit.

166
00:11:57,849 --> 00:11:59,851
Uh, my son, Thor,
has returned!

167
00:12:00,226 --> 00:12:03,229
Greetings, my boy.

168
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:04,981
It's an interesting play.
What's it called?

169
00:12:05,273 --> 00:12:07,233
<i>The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.</i>

170
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:09,235
The people wanted
to commemorate him.

171
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:10,737
Ah, indeed they should.

172
00:12:10,987 --> 00:12:12,197
I like the statue.

173
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:14,532
A lot better looking than he
was when he was alive, though.

174
00:12:14,824 --> 00:12:16,534
A little less weaselly,
less greasy, maybe.

175
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:19,663
Do you know what this is?

176
00:12:20,705 --> 00:12:23,541
The skull of Surtur.
That's a formidable weapon!

177
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:25,251
Do me a favor.
Lock this away in a vault...

178
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:27,170
so it doesn't turn
into a giant monster

179
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:28,630
and destroy the whole planet.

180
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:31,925
Thank you, dear. Um...

181
00:12:32,008 --> 00:12:34,678
So it's back to Midgard
for you, is it?

182
00:12:35,053 --> 00:12:36,054
Nope.

183
00:12:36,638 --> 00:12:39,182
I've been having this
reoccurring dream lately.

184
00:12:39,474 --> 00:12:42,143
Every night,
I see Asgard fall into ruins.

185
00:12:42,435 --> 00:12:43,436
That's just
a silly dream...

186
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:45,563
signs of an overactive
imagination.

187
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:46,856
Possibly.

188
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,775
But then I decide to go
out there and investigate.

189
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:50,193
And what do I find,

190
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:53,029
but the Nine Realms
completely in chaos.

191
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:56,157
Enemies of Asgard assembling,
plotting our demise...

192
00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:57,867
all while you, Odin,

193
00:12:57,951 --> 00:12:59,244
the protector
of those Nine Realms...

194
00:12:59,536 --> 00:13:01,079
are sitting here
in your bathrobe,

195
00:13:01,162 --> 00:13:02,163
eating grapes.

196
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:04,374
Yes, it is best to respect
our neighbors' freedom.

197
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,627
Yes, of course,
the freedom to be massacred.

198
00:13:09,546 --> 00:13:11,589
Yes, besides I've been
rather busy myself.

199
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:12,882
Watching theater.

200
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:14,801
Board meetings, and security
council meetings...

201
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,094
You're really gonna
make me do it?

202
00:13:16,344 --> 00:13:17,512
Do what?

203
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:23,226
You know that
nothing will stop Mjolnir

204
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:24,811
as it returns to my hand.

205
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:26,438
Not even your face.

206
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,815
You've gone quite mad.
You'll be executed for this.

207
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:31,526
Then I'll see you
on the other side, brother.

208
00:13:33,194 --> 00:13:34,320
All right, I yield.

209
00:13:44,622 --> 00:13:45,623
Behold!

210
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,667
Thor...

211
00:13:48,585 --> 00:13:49,794
- Odinson.
- No.

212
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:53,840
You had one job. Just the one.

213
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,010
Where's Odin?

214
00:13:57,302 --> 00:13:58,928
You just couldn't stay away,
could you?

215
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:00,972
Everything was fine
without you.

216
00:14:01,264 --> 00:14:03,808
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.

217
00:14:04,184 --> 00:14:05,310
- Ask them.
- Where's Father?

218
00:14:05,393 --> 00:14:07,020
- Did you kill him?
- You had what you wanted.

219
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,104
You had the independence
you asked for.

220
00:14:08,188 --> 00:14:09,314
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

221
00:14:09,397 --> 00:14:11,483
Okay. I know exactly
where he is.

222
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,747
I swear I left him right here.

223
00:14:27,415 --> 00:14:28,500
Right here
on the sidewalk,

224
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:29,876
or right there where the
building is being demolished?

225
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,211
Great planning.

226
00:14:31,586 --> 00:14:32,629
How was I supposed to know?

227
00:14:32,754 --> 00:14:33,963
Can't see into the future.
I'm not a witch.

228
00:14:34,547 --> 00:14:36,341
No? Then why do you dress
like one?

229
00:14:36,758 --> 00:14:38,718
- Hey.
- I can't believe you're alive.

230
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,345
I saw you die.

231
00:14:40,428 --> 00:14:42,138
I mourned you,
I cried for you.

232
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:43,515
I'm honored.

233
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,891
Ask him.

234
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:46,559
Hi. Would you mind taking
a picture with us?

235
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,937
Oh, sure.

236
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,563
Start figuring out
where he is.

237
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,565
Oh, my God.

238
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:53,733
Sorry to hear
that Jane dumped you.

239
00:14:54,859 --> 00:14:56,486
She didn't dump me, you know.

240
00:14:57,028 --> 00:14:58,822
I dumped her.
It was a mutual dumping.

241
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,659
What's this?
What are you doing?

242
00:15:02,992 --> 00:15:03,993
This isn't me.

243
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:09,707
Loki.

244
00:15:34,732 --> 00:15:36,651
Thor Odinson.

245
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:48,746
God of Thunder.

246
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:51,332
You can put down the umbrella.

247
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:11,144
So, Earth has, uh,
wizards now?

248
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:18,443
The preferred term is

249
00:16:18,526 --> 00:16:20,236
"Master of the Mystic Arts."
You can leave that now.

250
00:16:21,571 --> 00:16:22,906
All right, wizard.

251
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:24,282
Who are you?
Why should I care?

252
00:16:24,824 --> 00:16:26,618
My name
is Doctor Stephen Strange,

253
00:16:26,701 --> 00:16:28,661
and I have some questions
for you.

254
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:29,746
Take a seat.

255
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:35,877
Tea?

256
00:16:38,671 --> 00:16:39,672
I don't drink tea.

257
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:41,090
What do you drink?

258
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:42,550
Not tea.

259
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:47,639
So, I keep a watch list

260
00:16:47,764 --> 00:16:49,515
of individuals and beings
from other realms...

261
00:16:49,849 --> 00:16:51,392
that may be a threat
to this world.

262
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:55,063
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

263
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,732
He's a worthy inclusion. Hmm.

264
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:01,152
Then why bring him here?

265
00:17:01,694 --> 00:17:02,987
We're looking for my father.

266
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:06,491
So, if I were to tell you
where Odin was...

267
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:09,160
all parties concerned would
promptly return to Asgard?

268
00:17:09,535 --> 00:17:10,536
Promptly.

269
00:17:10,703 --> 00:17:11,913
Great! Then I'll help you.

270
00:17:12,413 --> 00:17:14,290
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?

271
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,209
I have to tell you,
he was adamant

272
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:17,293
that he not be disturbed.

273
00:17:17,585 --> 00:17:19,504
Your father said he had chosen
to remain in exile.

274
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:23,758
- Hmm.
- And you don't have a phone.

275
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:25,843
No, I don't have a phone...

276
00:17:26,135 --> 00:17:27,762
but you could have sent
an electronic letter.

277
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:28,930
It's called an email.

278
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:30,682
- Yeah, do you have a computer?
- No. What for?

279
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:32,934
- Uh-huh.
- Anyway,

280
00:17:33,017 --> 00:17:34,602
my father
is no longer in exile.

281
00:17:34,894 --> 00:17:36,437
So if you could
tell me where he is,

282
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:37,522
I can take him home.

283
00:17:37,814 --> 00:17:39,565
Gladly. He's in Norway.

284
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,735
I'm just seeing
whether this incantation

285
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:45,822
requires any Asgardian
modifications.

286
00:17:46,489 --> 00:17:47,532
Nope.

287
00:17:48,574 --> 00:17:49,575
Oh, we don't need that.

288
00:17:55,623 --> 00:17:57,709
Will you stop doing that?

289
00:17:59,168 --> 00:18:01,921
I need just one strand
of your hair.

290
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:03,172
Let me explain something.

291
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:05,758
My hair is not to be
meddled with.

292
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:14,767
We could have just walked.

293
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,355
He's waiting for you.

294
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:20,732
All right.

295
00:18:21,024 --> 00:18:22,275
Don't forget your umbrella.

296
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,693
Oh, yes.

297
00:18:31,492 --> 00:18:32,493
Sorry.

298
00:18:35,204 --> 00:18:36,748
There we go.

299
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,751
I suppose I'll need
my brother back.

300
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:41,586
Oh, yeah. Right.

301
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:50,136
I have been falling
for 30 minutes!

302
00:18:51,137 --> 00:18:52,305
You can handle him from here.

303
00:18:53,056 --> 00:18:54,057
Yes. Of course.

304
00:18:54,182 --> 00:18:55,475
Thank you very much
for your help.

305
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:56,726
Good luck.

306
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:58,770
Handle me? Who are you?

307
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,521
Loki.

308
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:01,939
You think you're
some kind of sorcerer?

309
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,733
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate...

310
00:19:04,025 --> 00:19:05,026
Bye-bye.

311
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:31,427
Father?

312
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:35,723
Look at this place.
It's beautiful.

313
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:42,563
Father, it's us.

314
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:47,485
My sons.

315
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:49,779
I've been waiting for you.

316
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,572
I know. We've come
to take you home.

317
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:53,533
Home, yes.

318
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:57,495
Your mother, she calls me.

319
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,040
Do you hear it?

320
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:04,710
Loki, lift your magic.

321
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,882
Took me quite a while
to break free from your spell.

322
00:20:10,174 --> 00:20:11,551
Frigga would have been proud.

323
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:14,345
Come and sit with me.
I don't have much time.

324
00:20:21,227 --> 00:20:22,728
I know that we failed you.

325
00:20:23,062 --> 00:20:24,188
But we can make this right.

326
00:20:24,939 --> 00:20:26,149
I failed you.

327
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:29,777
It is upon us. Ragnarok.

328
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:32,738
No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
I put an end to Surtur.

329
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:34,532
No.

330
00:20:35,116 --> 00:20:37,076
It has already begun.
She's coming.

331
00:20:38,494 --> 00:20:40,455
My life was all that
held her back.

332
00:20:40,538 --> 00:20:41,539
But my time has come.

333
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:46,210
I cannot keep her away
any longer.

334
00:20:46,752 --> 00:20:48,171
Father, who are you
talking about?

335
00:20:49,088 --> 00:20:51,841
Goddess of Death. Hela.

336
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:54,427
My firstborn.

337
00:20:55,636 --> 00:20:56,637
Your sister.

338
00:20:59,765 --> 00:21:01,392
Your what?

339
00:21:03,978 --> 00:21:06,689
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.

340
00:21:07,982 --> 00:21:11,027
I couldn't stop her,
so I imprisoned her.

341
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,195
Locked her away.

342
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:16,449
She draws her strength
from Asgard...

343
00:21:17,783 --> 00:21:21,287
and once she gets there,
her powers will be limitless.

344
00:21:21,996 --> 00:21:23,039
Whatever she is,
we can stop her together.

345
00:21:23,122 --> 00:21:24,123
We can face her together.

346
00:21:24,373 --> 00:21:25,374
No, we won't.

347
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:28,503
I'm on a different path now.

348
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:30,129
This you must face alone.

349
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:34,258
I love you, my sons.

350
00:21:37,094 --> 00:21:38,471
Look at that.

351
00:21:42,683 --> 00:21:44,227
Remember this place.

352
00:21:45,728 --> 00:21:47,104
Home.

353
00:22:27,061 --> 00:22:28,104
Brother.

354
00:22:35,945 --> 00:22:38,531
This was your doing.

355
00:23:21,115 --> 00:23:22,325
So he's gone.

356
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:28,539
That's a shame. I would've
liked to have seen that.

357
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,458
You must be Hela.

358
00:23:32,126 --> 00:23:33,377
I'm Thor, son of Odin.

359
00:23:33,794 --> 00:23:37,048
Really?
You don't look like him.

360
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,216
Perhaps we can come
to an arrangement.

361
00:23:39,634 --> 00:23:41,260
You sound like him.

362
00:23:43,346 --> 00:23:44,347
Kneel.

363
00:23:44,764 --> 00:23:45,848
Beg your pardon?

364
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:51,687
Kneel.

365
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:56,776
Before your queen.

366
00:23:58,194 --> 00:23:59,445
I don't think so.

367
00:24:10,164 --> 00:24:12,166
It's not possible.

368
00:24:13,334 --> 00:24:16,879
Darling, you have no idea
what's possible.

369
00:24:37,191 --> 00:24:38,192
Bring us back!

370
00:24:38,275 --> 00:24:39,276
No!

371
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:49,453
Loki!

372
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,002
Who are you?
What have you done with Thor?

373
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,467
I'm Hela.

374
00:25:46,802 --> 00:25:48,345
I'm just a janitor.

375
00:25:49,889 --> 00:25:52,933
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.

376
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,688
How would you like a job?

377
00:28:09,194 --> 00:28:10,654
Are you a fighter?

378
00:28:11,572 --> 00:28:12,823
Or are you food?

379
00:28:13,616 --> 00:28:14,992
I'm just passing through.

380
00:28:15,701 --> 00:28:16,994
It is food.

381
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:18,370
On your knees.

382
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,456
He's mine.

383
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,841
Wait!

384
00:29:21,892 --> 00:29:22,893
Wait!

385
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:26,230
He's mine.

386
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,566
So if you want him,
you go through me.

387
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:31,193
But we've already got him.

388
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,781
All right, then.
I guess I go through you.

389
00:29:36,448 --> 00:29:37,783
More food.

390
00:30:12,109 --> 00:30:14,486
Thank you.

391
00:30:49,855 --> 00:30:53,317
Scrapper 142. I need clearance
and an audience with the boss.

392
00:30:53,901 --> 00:30:55,569
I've got something special.

393
00:30:55,861 --> 00:30:58,072
Hey! Where are you taking me?

394
00:30:59,615 --> 00:31:00,741
Answer me!

395
00:31:01,116 --> 00:31:02,201
Hey!

396
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:05,037
I am Thor, son of Odin.
I need to get back to Asgard.

397
00:31:06,205 --> 00:31:08,290
Many apologies, your majesty.

398
00:31:37,027 --> 00:31:40,572
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.

399
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:51,250
I am Hela,
Odin's firstborn...

400
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,627
the commander
of the Legions of Asgard...

401
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,546
the rightful heir
to the throne,

402
00:31:55,629 --> 00:31:57,172
and the Goddess of Death.

403
00:32:01,844 --> 00:32:04,346
My father is dead.

404
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:06,390
As are the princes.
You're welcome.

405
00:32:07,141 --> 00:32:08,475
We were once the seat

406
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,435
of absolute power
in the cosmos.

407
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:12,813
Our supremacy
was unchallenged.

408
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:16,066
Yet Odin stopped
at Nine Realms.

409
00:32:16,358 --> 00:32:19,653
Our destiny is to rule over
all others.

410
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:23,615
And I am here
to restore that power.

411
00:32:25,284 --> 00:32:26,785
Kneel before me...

412
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:30,831
and rise into the ranks
of my great conquest.

413
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:34,168
Whoever you are...

414
00:32:34,376 --> 00:32:37,296
whatever you've done,
surrender now!

415
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,673
Or we will show you no mercy.

416
00:32:39,965 --> 00:32:41,383
Whoever I am?

417
00:32:41,466 --> 00:32:44,052
Did you listen
to a word I said?

418
00:32:44,344 --> 00:32:46,221
This is your last warning!

419
00:32:48,473 --> 00:32:50,559
I thought you'd be happy
to see me.

420
00:32:56,273 --> 00:32:57,608
Fine.

421
00:33:10,996 --> 00:33:12,206
Charge!

422
00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:08,512
Oh, I've missed this.

423
00:34:08,595 --> 00:34:10,347
Still, it's a shame.

424
00:34:11,223 --> 00:34:13,308
Good soldiers dying
for nothing...

425
00:34:13,392 --> 00:34:15,560
all because
they couldn't see the future.

426
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:17,271
Sad.

427
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:20,482
Oh, look, still alive.

428
00:34:28,156 --> 00:34:29,741
Change of heart?

429
00:34:30,158 --> 00:34:32,411
Go back to whatever cave
you crept out of.

430
00:34:33,954 --> 00:34:35,163
You evil demoness!

431
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:41,128
Let's go see my palace.

432
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:14,328
<i>Fear not, for you are found.</i>

433
00:35:16,538 --> 00:35:18,373
<i>You are home,
and there is no going back.</i>

434
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,795
<i>No one leaves this place.</i>

435
00:35:24,129 --> 00:35:25,672
<i>But what is this place?</i>

436
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:28,967
<i>The answer is Sakaar.</i>

437
00:35:31,011 --> 00:35:33,096
<i>Surrounded
by cosmic gateways...</i>

438
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:36,016
<i>Sakaar lives on the edge
of the known and unknown.</i>

439
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,976
<i>It is the collection point</i>

440
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,728
<i>for all lost
and unloved things...</i>

441
00:35:40,062 --> 00:35:41,688
<i>like you.</i>

442
00:35:41,897 --> 00:35:44,524
<i>But here on Sakaar,
you are significant.</i>

443
00:35:44,858 --> 00:35:46,234
<i>You are valuable.</i>

444
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:47,944
<i>Here you are loved.</i>

445
00:35:48,028 --> 00:35:49,029
What the hell?

446
00:35:49,154 --> 00:35:52,199
<i>And no one loves you more
than the Grandmaster.</i>

447
00:35:52,491 --> 00:35:54,451
<i>He is the original,</i>

448
00:35:54,534 --> 00:35:56,578
<i>the first lost
and the first found...</i>

449
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:57,871
<i>the creator of Sakaar...</i>

450
00:35:58,205 --> 00:36:01,249
<i>and father
of the Contest of Champions.</i>

451
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:05,712
<i>Where once you were nothing,
now you are something.</i>

452
00:36:06,046 --> 00:36:09,091
<i>You are the property
of the Grandmaster.</i>

453
00:36:09,466 --> 00:36:10,801
<i>Congratulations!</i>

454
00:36:11,051 --> 00:36:14,388
<i>You will meet the Grandmaster
in 5 seconds.</i>

455
00:36:14,846 --> 00:36:16,098
<i>Prepare yourself.</i>

456
00:36:18,016 --> 00:36:19,142
<i>Prepare yourself.</i>

457
00:36:20,852 --> 00:36:24,064
<i>You are now meeting
the Grandmaster.</i>

458
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:34,408
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

459
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,246
He's wonderful.
It is a he?

460
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:40,747
It is a he.

461
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:41,832
Yeah.

462
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,000
I love when you come
to visit, 142.

463
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:45,669
You bring me the best stuff.

464
00:36:46,086 --> 00:36:47,754
Whenever we get
to talking, Topaz,

465
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,548
about Scrapper 142...

466
00:36:49,756 --> 00:36:51,133
what do I always say?

467
00:36:51,216 --> 00:36:53,176
"She is the..."
And it starts with a "B."

468
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:54,386
Trash.

469
00:36:55,429 --> 00:36:57,139
No, not trash.

470
00:36:58,098 --> 00:36:59,558
Were you waiting
just to call her that?

471
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:01,017
It doesn't start with a "B."

472
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:02,310
Booze hag.

473
00:37:05,105 --> 00:37:07,315
Uh, I'm so sorry. No, "best."
I was thinking about "best."

474
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:08,692
'Cause I always say
you're the best.

475
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:10,861
She brought me my beloved
champion, you know.

476
00:37:11,153 --> 00:37:12,863
You say that every time
she's here.

477
00:37:13,113 --> 00:37:14,114
What have you brought today?
Tell me.

478
00:37:14,614 --> 00:37:15,615
A contender.

479
00:37:15,824 --> 00:37:16,825
A what?

480
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:19,035
I need to go closer.
I want a closer look at this.

481
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:21,163
Can you take us closer?
Thank you.

482
00:37:33,758 --> 00:37:34,759
Pay this lady.

483
00:37:34,926 --> 00:37:36,553
Just wait a damn minute.

484
00:37:36,845 --> 00:37:39,097
I'm not for sale.

485
00:37:45,562 --> 00:37:47,063
Man, he's a fighter.

486
00:37:47,272 --> 00:37:48,523
I take 10 million.

487
00:37:48,815 --> 00:37:49,816
Tell her she's dreaming.

488
00:37:50,025 --> 00:37:51,860
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
transfer the units.

489
00:37:58,992 --> 00:38:00,452
You'll pay for this.

490
00:38:00,827 --> 00:38:02,037
No, I got paid for this.

491
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:05,415
Here's what I wanna know.

492
00:38:07,209 --> 00:38:08,210
Who are you?

493
00:38:08,293 --> 00:38:12,255
I am the God of Thunder.

494
00:38:13,006 --> 00:38:14,758
Wow.

495
00:38:15,634 --> 00:38:16,843
I didn't hear any thunder,

496
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,970
but out of your fingers,
was that sparkles?

497
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:21,515
We've located your cousin.

498
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:23,600
Uh, oh, good!

499
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,852
Yeah, come on. I think
you're gonna like this.

500
00:38:26,186 --> 00:38:27,187
There he is.

501
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,355
Hey, cuz.

502
00:38:29,064 --> 00:38:31,233
We almost couldn't find you.
What, you been hiding?

503
00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:32,692
Hi.

504
00:38:32,984 --> 00:38:34,194
Hmm.

505
00:38:34,277 --> 00:38:35,403
So...

506
00:38:35,695 --> 00:38:36,696
Please.

507
00:38:37,405 --> 00:38:38,907
I'm sorry.

508
00:38:39,157 --> 00:38:40,200
Yeah.

509
00:38:40,408 --> 00:38:41,535
Carlo...

510
00:38:42,827 --> 00:38:43,912
I pardon you.

511
00:38:44,246 --> 00:38:45,455
Oh, thank you.

512
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:46,540
Thank you.

513
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:49,709
You're officially pardoned.
From life.

514
00:38:54,756 --> 00:38:56,758
Help me.

515
00:38:57,551 --> 00:39:00,053
Oh, my God!

516
00:39:00,595 --> 00:39:02,430
I'm stepping in it.
I'm stepping in it. Look!

517
00:39:03,223 --> 00:39:04,391
Wow.

518
00:39:04,933 --> 00:39:06,351
Oh, the smell.

519
00:39:06,893 --> 00:39:07,978
What does it smell like?

520
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,438
Burnt toast.

521
00:39:10,647 --> 00:39:12,232
What happened to my manners?

522
00:39:12,607 --> 00:39:14,025
I haven't
properly introduced myself.

523
00:39:14,317 --> 00:39:16,111
Come on. Uh, follow me.

524
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,530
My name is Grandmaster.

525
00:39:18,738 --> 00:39:20,532
I preside over
a little harlequinade

526
00:39:20,615 --> 00:39:22,033
called
the Contest of Champions.

527
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:23,702
People come from far and wide

528
00:39:23,785 --> 00:39:24,953
to unwillingly
participate in it.

529
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,371
And you, my friend,

530
00:39:26,454 --> 00:39:27,956
might just be part
of the new cast.

531
00:39:28,123 --> 00:39:29,165
What do you say to that?

532
00:39:29,249 --> 00:39:31,251
We're not friends and I don't
give a shit about your games.

533
00:39:31,459 --> 00:39:32,711
I'm going back to Asgard.

534
00:39:33,086 --> 00:39:35,171
Ass-gard.

535
00:39:35,964 --> 00:39:37,966
One, two, three, four.

536
00:39:39,634 --> 00:39:41,720
There was a wormhole
in space and time beneath me.

537
00:39:41,928 --> 00:39:45,056
At that moment,
I let go.

538
00:39:45,307 --> 00:39:46,308
Loki?

539
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:49,352
Loki! Loki!

540
00:39:49,603 --> 00:39:52,856
Over here. Over here.

541
00:39:53,106 --> 00:39:54,316
- Excuse me one second.
- Loki!

542
00:39:56,318 --> 00:39:57,485
- What?
- You're alive?

543
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:59,237
- Yes, of course I'm alive.
- What are you doing here?

544
00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:00,530
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

545
00:40:00,614 --> 00:40:01,615
I'm stuck
in this stupid chair.

546
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:02,991
- Where's your chair?
- I didn't get a chair.

547
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:04,659
- Get me out of this one.
- I can't.

548
00:40:04,743 --> 00:40:06,077
- Get me out. What?
- I can't.

549
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:07,162
I've made friends
with this man.

550
00:40:07,245 --> 00:40:08,246
He's called the Grandmaster.

551
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:09,456
- Oh, he's crazy!
- I've gained his favor.

552
00:40:09,748 --> 00:40:11,207
The Bifrost brought me
out here weeks ago.

553
00:40:11,499 --> 00:40:12,500
- Weeks ago?
- Yes.

554
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:13,710
I just got here.

555
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,961
What are you
whispering about?

556
00:40:16,254 --> 00:40:17,881
Time works real different
around these parts.

557
00:40:18,173 --> 00:40:21,092
On any other world, I'd be,
like, millions of years old.

558
00:40:21,384 --> 00:40:22,886
But here on Sakaar...

559
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:30,977
In any case,
you know this, uh...

560
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:32,395
You call yourself
Lord of Thunder?

561
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:34,856
God of Thunder.
Tell him.

562
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,733
I've never met this man
in my life.

563
00:40:37,025 --> 00:40:38,526
- He's my brother.
- Adopted.

564
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:39,694
Is he any kind of a fighter?

565
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,112
You take this thing

566
00:40:41,196 --> 00:40:42,197
out of my neck
and I'll show you.

567
00:40:42,447 --> 00:40:44,032
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.

568
00:40:44,282 --> 00:40:46,159
Hey, Sparkles,
here's the deal.

569
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:48,536
If you wanna get back
to Ass-place, Assberg...

570
00:40:48,787 --> 00:40:49,871
Asgard.

571
00:40:49,954 --> 00:40:52,791
Any contender who defeats
my champion...

572
00:40:52,999 --> 00:40:54,709
their freedom they shall win.

573
00:40:55,001 --> 00:40:56,544
Fine. Then point me
in the direction

574
00:40:56,628 --> 00:40:58,088
of whoever's ass
I have to kick!

575
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:00,840
That's what I call, contender.

576
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,385
Direction would be
this way, Lord.

577
00:41:03,843 --> 00:41:05,053
Ah! Loki!

578
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:12,936
Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy, man.

579
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,730
Over here.

580
00:41:15,897 --> 00:41:17,399
The pile of rocks
waving at you. Here.

581
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:20,110
Yeah, I'm actually a thing.
I'm a being.

582
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,945
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.

583
00:41:22,028 --> 00:41:23,321
I'm kind of like
the leader in here.

584
00:41:23,613 --> 00:41:25,365
I'm made of rocks,
as you can see.

585
00:41:25,448 --> 00:41:26,908
But don't let that
intimidate you.

586
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,368
You don't need to be afraid

587
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:29,994
unless you're
made of scissors.

588
00:41:30,203 --> 00:41:31,371
Just a little
rock-paper-scissor

589
00:41:31,454 --> 00:41:32,455
joke for you.

590
00:41:32,747 --> 00:41:35,375
This is my very good friend
over here, Miek.

591
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:38,294
He's an insect
and has knives for hands.

592
00:41:39,045 --> 00:41:40,338
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

593
00:41:40,714 --> 00:41:43,174
- That I am.
- How'd you end up in here?

594
00:41:43,425 --> 00:41:45,135
Ah, well, I tried to start
a revolution,

595
00:41:45,218 --> 00:41:46,261
but didn't print
enough pamphlets.

596
00:41:46,553 --> 00:41:47,929
So hardly anyone turned up,

597
00:41:48,012 --> 00:41:50,598
except for my mum
and her boyfriend, who I hate.

598
00:41:50,932 --> 00:41:52,225
As punishment, I was forced

599
00:41:52,308 --> 00:41:54,686
to be in here
and become a gladiator.

600
00:41:54,894 --> 00:41:56,187
Bit of a promotional disaster,
that one.

601
00:41:56,521 --> 00:41:59,107
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.

602
00:41:59,399 --> 00:42:00,400
I don't know
if you'd be interested

603
00:42:00,483 --> 00:42:01,526
in something like that.

604
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:03,278
Do you reckon
you'd be interested?

605
00:42:05,572 --> 00:42:06,573
How did you...

606
00:42:06,823 --> 00:42:09,409
Ah, yeah, no.
This whole thing is a circle.

607
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:12,746
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.

608
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,247
This doesn't make any sense.

609
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,623
No, nothing makes sense
here, man.

610
00:42:15,874 --> 00:42:17,250
The only thing
that does make sense

611
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:18,710
is that nothing makes sense.

612
00:42:19,043 --> 00:42:21,254
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?

613
00:42:21,546 --> 00:42:22,547
Doug has.

614
00:42:22,714 --> 00:42:23,715
Doug!

615
00:42:23,965 --> 00:42:24,966
Our luck, Doug's dead.

616
00:42:25,049 --> 00:42:26,050
That's right.

617
00:42:26,217 --> 00:42:27,302
Everyone who fights

618
00:42:27,385 --> 00:42:28,470
the Grandmaster's champion
perishes.

619
00:42:28,928 --> 00:42:30,472
What about you?
You're made of rocks.

620
00:42:30,722 --> 00:42:33,266
Perishable rock. There you go.
Another one gone.

621
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,351
Yeah, no, I just do
the smaller fights,

622
00:42:35,435 --> 00:42:37,270
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

623
00:42:37,562 --> 00:42:39,189
Wait. You're not gonna
face him, are you?

624
00:42:39,481 --> 00:42:40,774
Yes, I am.

625
00:42:41,107 --> 00:42:42,859
Gonna fight him, win,

626
00:42:42,942 --> 00:42:44,235
and get the hell out
of this place.

627
00:42:44,986 --> 00:42:46,738
That's exactly
what Doug used to say.

628
00:42:47,071 --> 00:42:48,782
See you later, new Doug.

629
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:00,335
Does no one remember me?

630
00:43:01,127 --> 00:43:03,379
Has no one been taught
our history?

631
00:43:09,177 --> 00:43:10,512
Look at these lies.

632
00:43:11,346 --> 00:43:12,680
Goblets and garden parties?

633
00:43:15,058 --> 00:43:16,601
Peace treaties?

634
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:18,645
Odin...

635
00:43:18,895 --> 00:43:20,396
proud to have it...

636
00:43:20,688 --> 00:43:21,940
ashamed of how he got it.

637
00:43:41,376 --> 00:43:43,503
We were unstoppable.

638
00:43:43,586 --> 00:43:45,505
I was his weapon
in the conquest

639
00:43:45,588 --> 00:43:48,049
that built Asgard's empire.

640
00:43:50,927 --> 00:43:54,222
One by one,
the realms became ours.

641
00:43:54,472 --> 00:43:58,560
But then, simply because
my ambition outgrew his...

642
00:43:58,852 --> 00:44:03,398
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.

643
00:44:03,773 --> 00:44:06,442
Before that, Asgard's warriors
were honored...

644
00:44:06,734 --> 00:44:10,238
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.

645
00:44:21,499 --> 00:44:23,167
- Odin's treasures.
- Fake.

646
00:44:25,461 --> 00:44:27,881
Most of the stuff in here
is fake.

647
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:29,674
Or weak.

648
00:44:31,885 --> 00:44:33,761
Smaller than I thought
it would be.

649
00:44:34,929 --> 00:44:36,431
That's not bad.

650
00:44:36,514 --> 00:44:38,182
But this...

651
00:44:38,892 --> 00:44:40,894
The Eternal Flame.

652
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,507
Want to see what true power
really looks like?

653
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,956
Fenris, my darling,
what have they done to you?

654
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,504
With the Eternal Flame,
you are reborn.

655
00:46:05,186 --> 00:46:06,980
I've missed you.

656
00:46:07,939 --> 00:46:09,732
I've missed you all.

657
00:46:12,568 --> 00:46:13,569
Odin...

658
00:46:13,861 --> 00:46:17,031
I bid you take your place
in the halls of Valhalla...

659
00:46:17,323 --> 00:46:19,575
where the brave
shall live forever.

660
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,371
Nor shall we mourn
but rejoice...

661
00:46:23,746 --> 00:46:24,998
for those that have died...

662
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:26,374
...the glorious death.

663
00:46:34,465 --> 00:46:35,758
Hurts, doesn't it?

664
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:37,051
Being lied to.

665
00:46:38,094 --> 00:46:39,429
Being told you're one thing

666
00:46:39,512 --> 00:46:41,389
and then learning
it's all a fiction.

667
00:46:46,352 --> 00:46:48,229
You didn't think I'd really
come and see you, did you?

668
00:46:48,521 --> 00:46:50,148
This place is disgusting.

669
00:46:53,151 --> 00:46:54,861
Does this mean
you don't want my help?

670
00:46:55,153 --> 00:46:57,071
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my
position with the Grandmaster.

671
00:46:57,238 --> 00:46:58,614
It took me time
to win his trust.

672
00:46:58,698 --> 00:47:00,158
He's a lunatic,
but he can be amenable.

673
00:47:00,491 --> 00:47:01,701
What I'm telling you is,

674
00:47:01,784 --> 00:47:03,578
you could join me
at the Grandmaster's side.

675
00:47:03,828 --> 00:47:04,829
Perhaps, in time,

676
00:47:04,912 --> 00:47:08,374
an accident befalls
the Grandmaster, and then...

677
00:47:14,422 --> 00:47:16,799
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?

678
00:47:19,385 --> 00:47:21,971
Our sister destroyed
your hammer

679
00:47:22,055 --> 00:47:23,431
like a piece of glass.

680
00:47:24,515 --> 00:47:26,184
She's stronger than both of
us. She's stronger than you.

681
00:47:26,392 --> 00:47:27,685
You don't stand a chance.

682
00:47:27,852 --> 00:47:30,021
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

683
00:47:34,567 --> 00:47:35,568
Fine.

684
00:47:38,279 --> 00:47:40,740
I guess
I'll just have to go it alone.

685
00:47:41,657 --> 00:47:42,658
Like I've always done.

686
00:47:45,787 --> 00:47:46,954
Would you say something?

687
00:47:49,749 --> 00:47:51,167
Say something!

688
00:47:52,418 --> 00:47:54,504
What would you like me to say?

689
00:47:55,004 --> 00:47:57,090
You faked your own death...

690
00:47:57,381 --> 00:47:59,884
you stole the throne,
stripped Odin of his power...

691
00:48:00,134 --> 00:48:01,594
stranded him on Earth to die,

692
00:48:01,677 --> 00:48:03,304
releasing
the Goddess of Death.

693
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:05,098
Have I said enough or would
you like me to go back

694
00:48:05,181 --> 00:48:07,100
further than the past
two days?

695
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:10,186
You know, I haven't seen this

696
00:48:10,269 --> 00:48:12,313
beloved champion
he talks of...

697
00:48:12,605 --> 00:48:14,482
but I've heard
he is astonishingly savage.

698
00:48:15,274 --> 00:48:17,860
I've placed a large wager
against you tomorrow.

699
00:48:19,237 --> 00:48:20,238
Don't let me down.

700
00:48:24,283 --> 00:48:25,701
Piss off, ghost!

701
00:48:28,287 --> 00:48:29,747
He's freaking gone.

702
00:48:38,172 --> 00:48:39,173
Oh, yuck!

703
00:48:39,298 --> 00:48:41,384
There's still someone's hair
and blood all over this.

704
00:48:41,676 --> 00:48:42,969
Guys, can you clean up
the weapons

705
00:48:43,052 --> 00:48:44,262
once you finish your fight?

706
00:48:44,428 --> 00:48:45,429
Disgusting slobs.

707
00:48:46,681 --> 00:48:48,099
Oh, Thor...

708
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:50,393
wanna use a big wooden fork?

709
00:48:50,768 --> 00:48:51,769
No.

710
00:48:51,894 --> 00:48:53,062
Yeah, not really useful.

711
00:48:53,271 --> 00:48:54,981
Unless you're fighting off
three vampires

712
00:48:55,064 --> 00:48:56,649
that were huddled together.

713
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:59,110
I really wish I had my hammer.

714
00:48:59,527 --> 00:49:00,528
Hammer?

715
00:49:00,736 --> 00:49:02,238
Quite unique.
It was made from this

716
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:04,282
special metal from the heart
of a dying star.

717
00:49:04,866 --> 00:49:06,325
And when I spun it really,
really fast,

718
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:07,910
it gave me the ability to fly.

719
00:49:08,035 --> 00:49:09,036
You rode a hammer?

720
00:49:09,287 --> 00:49:10,705
No, I didn't ride the hammer.

721
00:49:11,122 --> 00:49:12,373
The hammer rode you
on your back?

722
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:14,125
No. I used to spin it
really fast,

723
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:15,793
and it would pull me
off the...

724
00:49:15,877 --> 00:49:17,962
Oh, my God.
A hammer pulled you off?

725
00:49:18,045 --> 00:49:19,797
The ground. It would pull me
off the ground,

726
00:49:19,881 --> 00:49:21,674
up into the air,
and I would fly.

727
00:49:21,966 --> 00:49:22,967
Every time I threw it,

728
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:24,844
it would always
come back to me.

729
00:49:25,219 --> 00:49:26,345
Sounds like you had
a pretty special

730
00:49:26,429 --> 00:49:27,805
and intimate relationship
with this hammer...

731
00:49:27,889 --> 00:49:29,015
and that losing it

732
00:49:29,098 --> 00:49:30,892
was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.

733
00:49:32,018 --> 00:49:34,103
That's a nice way
of putting it.

734
00:49:35,771 --> 00:49:37,023
I said they're mine.

735
00:49:38,566 --> 00:49:40,443
See her, that's the one
that put me in here.

736
00:49:40,776 --> 00:49:42,987
Oh, yeah. Scrapper 142.

737
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:45,198
Gotta watch out
for those Asgardians, man.

738
00:49:45,281 --> 00:49:46,866
They are hard to perish.

739
00:49:47,074 --> 00:49:48,451
Asgardian?

740
00:49:50,286 --> 00:49:52,163
Hey. Hey.

741
00:49:52,914 --> 00:49:53,915
Hey.

742
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:56,918
Do not zap me with that thing.
I just wanna talk.

743
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,004
Asgard is in danger.

744
00:50:04,508 --> 00:50:05,968
My God, you're a Valkyrie.

745
00:50:07,053 --> 00:50:09,263
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie
when I was younger...

746
00:50:09,597 --> 00:50:11,891
until I found out that
you were all women.

747
00:50:12,058 --> 00:50:13,059
There's nothing wrong
with women, of course.

748
00:50:13,142 --> 00:50:14,143
I love women.

749
00:50:14,352 --> 00:50:15,770
Sometimes a little too much.

750
00:50:15,978 --> 00:50:17,021
Not in a creepy way,

751
00:50:17,104 --> 00:50:18,814
just more
of a respectful appreciation.

752
00:50:19,106 --> 00:50:20,358
I think it's great
that there is

753
00:50:20,441 --> 00:50:23,486
an elite force
of women warriors.

754
00:50:23,736 --> 00:50:25,154
It's about time.

755
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:27,782
Are you done?

756
00:50:27,865 --> 00:50:28,866
Lord of Thunder,
you're up.

757
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:30,034
Please, help me.
I need your help.

758
00:50:30,117 --> 00:50:31,118
Bye.

759
00:50:31,202 --> 00:50:33,371
Fine, then you must be
a traitor or a coward.

760
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:35,915
Because the Valkyrie is sworn
to protect the throne.

761
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:39,710
Listen closely, your majesty.
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.

762
00:50:40,336 --> 00:50:41,921
And I'm a Scrapper,
not a Valkyrie.

763
00:50:45,258 --> 00:50:47,134
Bring him in for processing.

764
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:51,222
And no one escapes this place.
So you're gonna die anyway.

765
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,610
Now, don't you move.

766
00:51:04,986 --> 00:51:07,488
My hands ain't as steady
as they used to be.

767
00:51:07,738 --> 00:51:10,533
By Odin's beard,
you shall not cut my hair...

768
00:51:10,866 --> 00:51:13,327
lest you feel the wrath
of the mighty Thor.

769
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:20,084
Please. Please, kind sir,
do not cut my hair.

770
00:51:21,419 --> 00:51:22,753
Please! No!

771
00:51:22,962 --> 00:51:24,005
No!

772
00:51:36,309 --> 00:51:39,061
<i>Wow! Look at
all of you</i>.

773
00:51:39,145 --> 00:51:40,813
<i>What a show! What a night!</i>

774
00:51:41,063 --> 00:51:42,064
<i>Who's having fun?</i>

775
00:51:42,982 --> 00:51:44,859
<i>Please, I'm your host.</i>

776
00:51:45,109 --> 00:51:46,277
<i>Big round of applause</i>

777
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,237
<i>for all of our
undercard competitors...</i>

778
00:51:48,487 --> 00:51:51,198
<i>who today died so gruesomely.</i>

779
00:51:51,449 --> 00:51:52,575
<i>Good sports.</i>

780
00:51:52,825 --> 00:51:54,410
<i>What a show! What a night!</i>

781
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,748
<i>This is what you've come for,
and so have I.</i>

782
00:52:04,795 --> 00:52:07,631
<i>And now,
without further ado...</i>

783
00:52:07,715 --> 00:52:10,217
<i>it's main event time.</i>

784
00:52:12,136 --> 00:52:13,596
<i>Making his first appearance,</i>

785
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:15,222
<i>though he looks
quite promising...</i>

786
00:52:15,681 --> 00:52:17,350
<i>got a couple of tricks
up his sleeve.</i>

787
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:20,394
<i>I'll say no more,
see what you think.</i>

788
00:52:20,895 --> 00:52:22,063
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you...</i>

789
00:52:23,189 --> 00:52:25,358
<i>Lord of Thunder.</i>

790
00:52:48,672 --> 00:52:50,841
<i>Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparks.</i>

791
00:52:50,925 --> 00:52:52,259
<i>Okay, this is it.</i>

792
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,679
<i>Let's get ready to welcome
this guy. Here he comes.</i>

793
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:06,107
<i>He is a creature.</i>

794
00:53:06,315 --> 00:53:07,608
<i>What can we say about him?</i>

795
00:53:07,691 --> 00:53:10,152
<i>Well, he's unique.
There's none like him.</i>

796
00:53:10,403 --> 00:53:12,822
<i>I feel a special connection
with him.</i>

797
00:53:14,657 --> 00:53:15,825
<i>He's undefeated.</i>

798
00:53:17,284 --> 00:53:18,702
<i>He's the reigning.</i>

799
00:53:21,122 --> 00:53:23,165
<i>He's the defending.</i>

800
00:53:23,666 --> 00:53:24,667
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

801
00:53:25,084 --> 00:53:26,085
<i>I give you...</i>

802
00:53:26,419 --> 00:53:27,420
Uh-oh.

803
00:53:30,965 --> 00:53:34,635
<i>...your Incredible...</i>

804
00:53:38,472 --> 00:53:40,307
Hulk!

805
00:53:40,933 --> 00:53:42,268
Yes!

806
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:48,065
I have to get off this planet.

807
00:53:48,816 --> 00:53:50,568
Hey, hey, hey.
Where you going?

808
00:53:58,951 --> 00:54:00,077
Hey!

809
00:54:00,786 --> 00:54:01,996
We know each other.

810
00:54:02,455 --> 00:54:04,331
He's a friend from work.

811
00:54:13,716 --> 00:54:15,259
Where have you been?

812
00:54:15,468 --> 00:54:17,470
Everybody thought
you were dead.

813
00:54:17,761 --> 00:54:19,555
But so much has happened
since I last saw you.

814
00:54:20,181 --> 00:54:21,724
I lost my hammer.

815
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:24,852
Like, yesterday,
so that's still pretty fresh.

816
00:54:25,394 --> 00:54:27,563
Loki. Loki's alive.
Can you believe it?

817
00:54:27,855 --> 00:54:28,898
He's up there.

818
00:54:29,106 --> 00:54:31,025
Loki! Look who it is!

819
00:54:33,277 --> 00:54:35,279
Banner, I never thought
I would say this...

820
00:54:35,362 --> 00:54:37,615
but I'm happy to see you.

821
00:54:37,948 --> 00:54:40,284
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

822
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:47,082
Banner.

823
00:54:48,209 --> 00:54:49,460
Hey, Banner!

824
00:54:50,044 --> 00:54:52,046
No Banner. Only Hulk.

825
00:54:52,546 --> 00:54:53,589
What are you doing?

826
00:54:53,672 --> 00:54:55,549
It's me. It's Thor!

827
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:17,238
Banner, we're friends.

828
00:55:17,321 --> 00:55:19,281
This is crazy.
I don't want to hurt you!

829
00:55:26,413 --> 00:55:28,249
Here we go.

830
00:55:47,101 --> 00:55:48,185
What?

831
00:55:58,737 --> 00:56:00,114
Hey, big guy.

832
00:56:02,074 --> 00:56:03,951
The sun's getting real low.

833
00:56:15,254 --> 00:56:17,590
That's it.
The sun's going down.

834
00:56:20,718 --> 00:56:22,303
I won't hurt you anymore.

835
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,971
No one will.

836
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:38,152
Yes! That's how it feels!

837
00:56:39,737 --> 00:56:41,280
I'm just a huge fan
of the sport.

838
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:51,415
All right. Screw it.

839
00:56:57,463 --> 00:56:58,589
Oh!

840
00:57:03,177 --> 00:57:04,261
I know
you're in there, Banner.

841
00:57:04,345 --> 00:57:05,346
I'll get you out!

842
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:16,565
What's the matter with you?
You're embarrassing me!

843
00:57:16,815 --> 00:57:17,941
I told them we were friends!

844
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:52,286
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

845
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,876
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

846
00:59:30,532 --> 00:59:33,160
Another day, another Doug.

847
00:59:42,419 --> 00:59:44,338
What is that noise?

848
00:59:44,588 --> 00:59:47,257
The common folk aren't exactly
falling in line.

849
00:59:47,758 --> 00:59:51,345
There's a resistance trying
to knock down the front gates.

850
00:59:56,892 --> 00:59:58,644
Tell me about yourself,
Skurge.

851
00:59:59,144 --> 01:00:01,355
Well, me dad was a stonemason.
Me mum was...

852
01:00:01,605 --> 01:00:03,524
Right, yeah,
I'll just stop you there.

853
01:00:03,607 --> 01:00:05,359
What I meant was...

854
01:00:05,859 --> 01:00:07,152
what's your ambition?

855
01:00:08,445 --> 01:00:11,698
I just want a chance
to prove myself.

856
01:00:12,449 --> 01:00:13,450
Recognition.

857
01:00:13,826 --> 01:00:15,077
When I was young...

858
01:00:15,494 --> 01:00:18,997
every great king
had an executioner.

859
01:00:19,289 --> 01:00:21,208
Not just to execute people...

860
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,961
but also
to execute their vision.

861
01:00:25,087 --> 01:00:27,756
But mainly to execute people.

862
01:00:28,048 --> 01:00:29,967
Still, it was a great honor.

863
01:00:31,927 --> 01:00:34,513
I was Odin's executioner.

864
01:00:35,806 --> 01:00:39,893
And you shall be
my executioner.

865
01:00:45,524 --> 01:00:47,401
Let's begin our conquest.

866
01:00:58,912 --> 01:01:00,330
Skurge, where's the sword?

867
01:01:05,752 --> 01:01:09,464
That sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.

868
01:01:10,048 --> 01:01:11,425
Those people you mentioned,

869
01:01:11,508 --> 01:01:13,510
the ones who aren't
falling into line...

870
01:01:14,177 --> 01:01:15,262
round them up.

871
01:01:39,202 --> 01:01:40,621
Excuse me.

872
01:01:52,716 --> 01:01:54,134
Sorry about that.

873
01:01:54,217 --> 01:01:55,510
These bloody things
are everywhere.

874
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:57,971
Come on.

875
01:02:32,923 --> 01:02:34,508
You'll be safe here.

876
01:03:43,994 --> 01:03:44,995
Are we cool?

877
01:03:48,874 --> 01:03:50,292
It's Hulk in a hot tub.

878
01:03:51,793 --> 01:03:53,170
So how long
have you been like that?

879
01:03:53,837 --> 01:03:54,880
Like what?

880
01:03:55,505 --> 01:03:58,800
Like this. Big, and green,
and stupid.

881
01:04:00,177 --> 01:04:02,095
Hulk always Hulk.

882
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:08,268
How'd you get here?

883
01:04:09,186 --> 01:04:10,187
Winning.

884
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:11,855
You mean cheating, huh?

885
01:04:11,938 --> 01:04:14,274
Were they wearing one of these
when you won?

886
01:04:14,524 --> 01:04:15,692
How'd you arrive here?

887
01:04:18,695 --> 01:04:19,696
Quinjet.

888
01:04:20,072 --> 01:04:22,407
Yes. Now,
where is the Quinjet now?

889
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:29,247
That's naked.

890
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:32,125
He's very naked. Hmm.

891
01:04:35,003 --> 01:04:36,922
It's in my brain now.

892
01:04:37,756 --> 01:04:38,757
Quinjet.

893
01:04:49,684 --> 01:04:50,769
Yes!

894
01:04:51,144 --> 01:04:52,395
I'm getting us out of here.

895
01:04:52,771 --> 01:04:55,023
This is a terrible,
awful place.

896
01:04:55,273 --> 01:04:58,902
You're gonna love Asgard.
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.

897
01:04:59,194 --> 01:05:00,445
Hulk stay.

898
01:05:00,779 --> 01:05:03,990
No, no, no. My people need me
to get back to Asgard.

899
01:05:04,866 --> 01:05:06,535
We must prevent Ragnarok.

900
01:05:06,868 --> 01:05:07,953
Ragnarok?

901
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:09,830
The prophesied death
of my home world.

902
01:05:09,913 --> 01:05:11,248
The end of days,
it's the end of...

903
01:05:13,667 --> 01:05:15,627
If you help me
get back to Asgard...

904
01:05:15,919 --> 01:05:17,879
I can help you
get back to Earth. Huh?

905
01:05:18,171 --> 01:05:19,172
Earth hate Hulk.

906
01:05:19,464 --> 01:05:20,799
Earth loves Hulk.
They love you.

907
01:05:21,174 --> 01:05:22,384
You're one of the Avengers.

908
01:05:22,467 --> 01:05:23,677
One of the team,
one of our friends.

909
01:05:24,302 --> 01:05:26,138
This is what friends do.
They support each other.

910
01:05:26,429 --> 01:05:27,514
You're Banner's friend.

911
01:05:27,806 --> 01:05:29,850
I'm not Banner's friend.
I prefer you.

912
01:05:30,183 --> 01:05:31,184
Banner's friend.

913
01:05:31,268 --> 01:05:32,269
I don't even like Banner.

914
01:05:32,394 --> 01:05:35,188
"I'm into numbers and science
and stuff."

915
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:37,149
Thor go. Hulk stay.

916
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:38,567
Fine.

917
01:05:39,151 --> 01:05:40,152
Stay here.

918
01:05:41,027 --> 01:05:43,363
Stupid place.
It's hideous, by the way.

919
01:05:43,655 --> 01:05:46,992
The red, the white.
Just pick a color. Ridiculous.

920
01:05:47,951 --> 01:05:49,035
Smash you.

921
01:05:49,327 --> 01:05:51,496
You didn't smash anything.
I won that fight.

922
01:05:51,788 --> 01:05:53,790
- I smashed you.
- Yeah, sure, sure.

923
01:05:54,082 --> 01:05:55,709
- Baby arms.
- What?

924
01:05:56,001 --> 01:05:57,169
Baby.

925
01:05:57,252 --> 01:05:58,670
Moron! You big child.

926
01:05:58,962 --> 01:06:00,046
Thor go!

927
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:01,882
I am going.

928
01:06:06,011 --> 01:06:07,262
Thor go again.

929
01:06:12,142 --> 01:06:13,310
Thor home.

930
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:24,905
Hulk trains.

931
01:06:25,322 --> 01:06:27,157
That's great. Have fun.

932
01:06:27,532 --> 01:06:29,075
- Hey, big guy.
- Angry girl.

933
01:06:29,201 --> 01:06:30,368
What have you been up to?

934
01:06:30,702 --> 01:06:31,703
Winning.

935
01:06:42,214 --> 01:06:45,300
Heimdall, I know
you can see me.

936
01:06:46,718 --> 01:06:48,428
<i>I need you to help me.</i>

937
01:06:50,889 --> 01:06:51,890
Help me see.

938
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,736
I see you,
but you're far away.

939
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:06,863
What's going on here?

940
01:07:07,197 --> 01:07:08,490
Come see for yourself.

941
01:07:11,243 --> 01:07:12,702
I'm providing refuge
in a stronghold

942
01:07:12,786 --> 01:07:13,787
built by our ancestors.

943
01:07:14,287 --> 01:07:17,540
But if the garrison falls,
our only escape is Bifrost.

944
01:07:17,832 --> 01:07:19,751
You're talking
about evacuating Asgard?

945
01:07:22,921 --> 01:07:24,839
We won't last long if we stay.

946
01:07:25,507 --> 01:07:26,841
She draws her power
from Asgard

947
01:07:26,925 --> 01:07:28,051
and grows stronger every day.

948
01:07:28,343 --> 01:07:29,344
Come on.

949
01:07:33,431 --> 01:07:34,808
Hela is ravenous.

950
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,101
If I let her leave,

951
01:07:36,184 --> 01:07:37,978
she'll consume Nine Realms
and all the cosmos.

952
01:07:38,311 --> 01:07:39,312
We need you.

953
01:07:39,396 --> 01:07:40,480
I'm working on it.
But I don't even know

954
01:07:40,563 --> 01:07:41,564
where the hell I am.

955
01:07:42,107 --> 01:07:44,150
You're on a planet surrounded
by doorways. Go through one.

956
01:07:44,442 --> 01:07:46,236
- Which one?
- The big one.

957
01:08:15,307 --> 01:08:16,474
Thor sad.

958
01:08:16,933 --> 01:08:18,018
Shut up.

959
01:08:20,395 --> 01:08:21,855
Thor sad.

960
01:08:23,106 --> 01:08:24,733
I'm not sad, you idiot.

961
01:08:25,233 --> 01:08:26,860
- I'm pissed off!
- Oh.

962
01:08:28,028 --> 01:08:30,488
Angry. I lost my father.

963
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,200
I lost my hammer.

964
01:08:34,326 --> 01:08:35,910
- You're not even listening.
- Whining and crying.

965
01:08:35,994 --> 01:08:37,162
Cry like baby.

966
01:08:37,579 --> 01:08:39,039
Don't kick stuff.

967
01:08:40,457 --> 01:08:42,500
You're being
a really bad friend.

968
01:08:42,792 --> 01:08:43,793
You bad friend!

969
01:08:44,169 --> 01:08:45,253
- You know what we call you?
- No.

970
01:08:45,503 --> 01:08:47,130
We call you
the stupid Avenger.

971
01:08:47,505 --> 01:08:49,341
You're tiny Avenger!

972
01:08:52,135 --> 01:08:53,136
What, are you crazy?

973
01:08:53,345 --> 01:08:54,346
Yes.

974
01:08:54,512 --> 01:08:56,890
You know what?
Earth does hate you.

975
01:09:17,702 --> 01:09:19,662
No. Mmm-mmm.

976
01:09:22,165 --> 01:09:24,709
I'm sorry I said those things.

977
01:09:25,585 --> 01:09:26,836
You're not the stupid Avenger.

978
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,963
Nobody calls you
the stupid Avenger.

979
01:09:29,798 --> 01:09:31,091
It's okay.

980
01:09:31,466 --> 01:09:32,467
You just can't go around
throwing shields

981
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:33,676
at people.
Could have killed me.

982
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:34,969
I know. I'm sorry.

983
01:09:35,053 --> 01:09:36,721
I just get so angry
all the time.

984
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:38,848
Hulk always, always angry.

985
01:09:39,182 --> 01:09:41,393
I know.
We're the same, you and I.

986
01:09:42,018 --> 01:09:43,478
We're just
a couple of hot-headed fools.

987
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:47,524
Yeah, same. Hulk like fire,
Thor like water.

988
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:50,235
We're kind of both like fire.

989
01:09:50,527 --> 01:09:52,404
But Hulk like real fire.

990
01:09:53,571 --> 01:09:55,824
Hulk like raging fire.

991
01:09:56,074 --> 01:09:58,201
Thor like smoldering fire.

992
01:10:00,829 --> 01:10:02,580
Hulk, I need you
to do something for me.

993
01:10:02,747 --> 01:10:03,748
Hmm?

994
01:10:09,254 --> 01:10:10,630
Angry girl.

995
01:10:18,096 --> 01:10:20,223
What's going on?
What are you...

996
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:31,109
You're so thick-headed
that you can't tell...

997
01:10:31,401 --> 01:10:32,735
when someone's hiding
all the way across

998
01:10:32,819 --> 01:10:34,112
the universe and wants
to be left alone.

999
01:10:34,404 --> 01:10:36,906
- We need to talk.
- No, you wanna talk to me.

1000
01:10:37,782 --> 01:10:38,825
I need her to stay.

1001
01:10:38,992 --> 01:10:39,993
Stay?

1002
01:10:40,618 --> 01:10:41,619
Block.

1003
01:10:43,371 --> 01:10:45,039
Stay.

1004
01:10:45,123 --> 01:10:46,708
- Please.
- Please.

1005
01:10:49,502 --> 01:10:50,503
All right.

1006
01:10:52,839 --> 01:10:54,549
Here's the deal.

1007
01:10:55,258 --> 01:10:56,843
I'll listen to you...

1008
01:10:57,677 --> 01:10:58,887
till this is empty.

1009
01:11:00,513 --> 01:11:02,640
Asgard is in danger and
people are dying.

1010
01:11:02,932 --> 01:11:04,309
We need to get back there.
I need your help.

1011
01:11:04,851 --> 01:11:05,852
Wow.

1012
01:11:06,561 --> 01:11:08,354
Finished. Bye.

1013
01:11:10,106 --> 01:11:11,357
Odin is dead.

1014
01:11:14,861 --> 01:11:16,946
Hela, the Goddess of Death,
has invaded Asgard.

1015
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:20,366
If Hela's back,
then Asgard's already lost.

1016
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,910
I'm going to stop her.

1017
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:23,912
- Alone?
- Nope.

1018
01:11:24,162 --> 01:11:25,371
I'm putting together a team.

1019
01:11:25,705 --> 01:11:28,333
It's me, you, and the big guy.

1020
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:30,919
No. No team. Only Hulk.

1021
01:11:31,211 --> 01:11:32,670
It's me and you.

1022
01:11:33,046 --> 01:11:34,047
I think it's only you.

1023
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:36,424
Wait. Just listen.
The Valkyrie are legend.

1024
01:11:36,591 --> 01:11:38,927
Elite warriors of Asgard
sworn to defend the throne.

1025
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:40,929
I'm not getting dragged into

1026
01:11:41,012 --> 01:11:42,013
another one of Odin's
family squabbles.

1027
01:11:42,764 --> 01:11:44,390
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your sister.

1028
01:11:44,682 --> 01:11:46,476
Her power comes from Asgard,
same as yours.

1029
01:11:46,768 --> 01:11:47,894
When it grew
beyond Odin's control

1030
01:11:47,977 --> 01:11:49,145
she massacred everyone
in the palace...

1031
01:11:49,437 --> 01:11:50,772
and tried to seize the throne.

1032
01:11:51,231 --> 01:11:52,774
When she tried
to escape her banishment...

1033
01:11:52,857 --> 01:11:55,151
he sent the Valkyrie in
to fight her back.

1034
01:11:56,778 --> 01:11:58,780
I only survived because...

1035
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:01,908
Look, I already faced her once

1036
01:12:01,991 --> 01:12:03,743
back when I believed
in the throne...

1037
01:12:04,035 --> 01:12:05,078
and it cost me everything.

1038
01:12:05,537 --> 01:12:06,913
That's what's wrong
with Asgard.

1039
01:12:06,996 --> 01:12:09,374
The throne, the secrets,
the whole golden sham.

1040
01:12:09,791 --> 01:12:10,917
I agree.

1041
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,211
Don't get familiar.

1042
01:12:13,836 --> 01:12:15,088
I agree.

1043
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:16,756
That's why I turned down
the throne.

1044
01:12:17,048 --> 01:12:18,925
But this isn't
about the crown.

1045
01:12:19,008 --> 01:12:20,051
This is about the people.

1046
01:12:20,343 --> 01:12:22,178
They're dying
and they're your people, too.

1047
01:12:22,554 --> 01:12:23,805
Forget it.

1048
01:12:24,931 --> 01:12:26,182
I have.

1049
01:12:26,432 --> 01:12:27,517
- Okay.
- Okay.

1050
01:12:27,767 --> 01:12:28,851
- Good. Great.
- Great.

1051
01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:30,061
Thank you.

1052
01:12:30,186 --> 01:12:31,729
- For what?
- For this.

1053
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:35,275
Didn't see that,
did you?

1054
01:12:36,943 --> 01:12:38,861
There... That's better.

1055
01:12:40,822 --> 01:12:42,448
You know, go ahead.

1056
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:47,120
Stay here and enslave people
for that lunatic.

1057
01:12:47,412 --> 01:12:48,663
Keep drinking, keep hiding.

1058
01:12:48,955 --> 01:12:50,039
But me...

1059
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:53,960
I choose to run
toward my problems

1060
01:12:54,043 --> 01:12:55,169
and not away from them.

1061
01:12:56,462 --> 01:12:57,547
Because that's what...

1062
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,679
Because that's what heroes do.

1063
01:13:16,357 --> 01:13:17,650
Friend stay!

1064
01:13:29,662 --> 01:13:30,830
Yes!

1065
01:13:45,428 --> 01:13:46,429
All right.

1066
01:13:50,433 --> 01:13:51,434

<i>Access denied.</i>

1078
01:14:12,538 --> 01:14:14,540
Damn you, Stark.

1079
01:14:14,999 --> 01:14:16,000
Point Break.

1080
01:14:16,376 --> 01:14:18,378
<i>Welcome, Point Break.</i>

1081
01:14:20,171 --> 01:14:22,006
Friend stay!

1082
01:14:22,298 --> 01:14:24,300
No, no, no! Stop!

1083
01:14:24,384 --> 01:14:26,094
Stay!

1084
01:14:26,427 --> 01:14:27,679
Stop!
Stop breaking everything!

1085
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:29,305
Don't go!

1086
01:14:32,767 --> 01:14:33,935
<i>Nice work, big guy.</i>

1087
01:14:34,060 --> 01:14:35,436
<i>We don't know
where Ultron's headed,</i>

1088
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,563
<i>but you're going very high,
very fast.</i>

1089
01:14:37,855 --> 01:14:39,315
<i>So, I need you to turn
this bird around, okay?</i>

1090
01:14:40,149 --> 01:14:42,568
<i>We can't track you
in stealth mode...</i>

1091
01:14:42,985 --> 01:14:44,487
<i>so I need you
to help me out. Okay?</i>

1092
01:14:48,366 --> 01:14:49,742
<i>I need you to...</i>

1093
01:15:05,842 --> 01:15:08,219
No! No, Banner!

1094
01:15:15,810 --> 01:15:16,978
Oh, jeez.

1095
01:15:18,062 --> 01:15:19,397
Banner.

1096
01:15:20,648 --> 01:15:22,108
Hey, hey, hey.

1097
01:15:22,358 --> 01:15:23,693
You all right, Banner?

1098
01:15:26,279 --> 01:15:28,030
Sun's going down.
Sun's going down.

1099
01:15:28,698 --> 01:15:29,866
That's it, breathe.

1100
01:15:30,575 --> 01:15:32,410
I won't hurt you.

1101
01:15:33,327 --> 01:15:34,328
Sun's going down.

1102
01:15:34,579 --> 01:15:35,872
- Thor.
- Yeah.

1103
01:15:36,873 --> 01:15:38,124
What happened to your hair?

1104
01:15:38,374 --> 01:15:39,584
Some creepy old man
cut it off.

1105
01:15:39,876 --> 01:15:41,169
- It looks good.
- Oh, thanks.

1106
01:15:41,461 --> 01:15:43,588
Where are we? Oh, how's Nat?

1107
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:46,799
- Uh, Nat is good, I'm sure.
- Is she okay?

1108
01:15:47,133 --> 01:15:48,801
- And what about Sokovia?
- Sokovia?

1109
01:15:49,093 --> 01:15:50,428
The city, Sokovia.
Did we save it?

1110
01:15:50,762 --> 01:15:51,804
- Banner, listen.
- What?

1111
01:15:52,054 --> 01:15:53,931
Sokovia. Ultron.
That was two years ago.

1112
01:15:54,265 --> 01:15:55,641
- What are you saying?
- Well...

1113
01:15:55,892 --> 01:15:56,893
What?

1114
01:15:57,810 --> 01:15:59,061
I've been Hulk for two years?

1115
01:15:59,562 --> 01:16:00,813
I'm afraid so.

1116
01:16:07,028 --> 01:16:08,029
What the hell happened?

1117
01:16:11,741 --> 01:16:13,159
Banner, there's something
you should know.

1118
01:16:15,828 --> 01:16:16,829
<i>Voice activation required.</i>

1119
01:16:16,954 --> 01:16:17,955
Banner.

1120
01:16:18,164 --> 01:16:19,582
<i>Welcome, strongest Avenger.</i>

1121
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:20,792
Uh, what?

1122
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:21,876
Ship's log.

1123
01:16:33,429 --> 01:16:34,889
Thor, where are we?

1124
01:16:35,181 --> 01:16:36,182
Yeah, about that.

1125
01:16:36,349 --> 01:16:37,600
<i>Sakaar, hear ye.</i>

1126
01:16:37,683 --> 01:16:39,393
<i>Attention please.
I have some bad news.</i>

1127
01:16:39,644 --> 01:16:42,313
<i>My beloved exalted champion
has turned up missing.</i>

1128
01:16:42,522 --> 01:16:44,774
<i>Take to the streets.
Celebrate my champion.</i>

1129
01:16:44,857 --> 01:16:45,858
Who's that?

1130
01:16:46,192 --> 01:16:47,693
He kind of runs the place.

1131
01:16:48,611 --> 01:16:49,862
You actually lived
at his house for awhile.

1132
01:16:49,946 --> 01:16:50,947
- I did?
- Yeah.

1133
01:16:51,322 --> 01:16:53,074
Quite a lot's happened. You
and I had a fight recently.

1134
01:16:53,866 --> 01:16:55,576
- Did I win?
- No, I won. Easily.

1135
01:16:56,035 --> 01:16:57,036
Doesn't sound right.

1136
01:16:57,119 --> 01:16:58,120
Well, it's true.

1137
01:16:58,204 --> 01:17:00,248
<i>It seems that that
criminally seductive</i>

1138
01:17:00,331 --> 01:17:02,667
<i>Lord of Thunder
has stolen him away.</i>

1139
01:17:03,042 --> 01:17:05,336
Seductive God of Thunder.
We need to move.

1140
01:17:06,295 --> 01:17:07,296
Oh, no.

1141
01:17:09,173 --> 01:17:10,258
This is bad.

1142
01:17:10,466 --> 01:17:12,301
This is really, really bad.

1143
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:18,724
Thor, I think
I'm freaking out.

1144
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:20,309
No, no, no.

1145
01:17:20,476 --> 01:17:22,311
Don't freak out. You're okay.
Put these on.

1146
01:17:22,562 --> 01:17:23,604
These are Tony's clothes.

1147
01:17:23,771 --> 01:17:24,981
- I know, come on.
- Is he here?

1148
01:17:25,273 --> 01:17:27,066
No, he's not here. But listen.
Just stay calm, okay?

1149
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:29,360
The sun's going down.
The sun's getting really low.

1150
01:17:29,443 --> 01:17:30,444
Sun's going down.

1151
01:17:38,244 --> 01:17:40,037
I'm upset!

1152
01:17:43,124 --> 01:17:44,917
I'm very upset.

1153
01:17:45,209 --> 01:17:47,044
You know what I like about
being upset? The blame.

1154
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:49,505
Right now, that's
the mindset that I'm in.

1155
01:17:49,589 --> 01:17:50,590
And you know who I'm blaming?

1156
01:17:50,965 --> 01:17:52,341
- Grandmaster, I can...
- Hey!

1157
01:17:52,508 --> 01:17:53,509
Don't interrupt me!

1158
01:17:53,718 --> 01:17:54,719
Here you go.

1159
01:17:55,636 --> 01:17:56,846
Why are you handing me
the melt stick?

1160
01:17:57,179 --> 01:17:58,806
He was interrupting.

1161
01:17:59,181 --> 01:18:00,850
That's not
a capital violation.

1162
01:18:01,142 --> 01:18:02,310
Where was I?

1163
01:18:02,852 --> 01:18:05,187
My precious champion
has come up missing...

1164
01:18:05,479 --> 01:18:07,440
and it's all because
of that Lord of Thunder.

1165
01:18:07,523 --> 01:18:09,692
It's all because of him.
Your brother.

1166
01:18:09,984 --> 01:18:12,820
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated.

1167
01:18:12,987 --> 01:18:13,988
I'm sure
there's a big history.

1168
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:15,239
And your contender...

1169
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:16,991
My dear friend...

1170
01:18:17,408 --> 01:18:19,118
if you were to give me
12 hours,

1171
01:18:19,201 --> 01:18:20,578
I could bring them both
back to you. Alive.

1172
01:18:20,828 --> 01:18:22,246
I could do it in two.

1173
01:18:23,247 --> 01:18:24,248
I could do it in one.

1174
01:18:24,498 --> 01:18:25,499
Let's stop there.

1175
01:18:25,708 --> 01:18:27,418
You know what?
I woke up this morning

1176
01:18:27,501 --> 01:18:29,211
thinking about
a public execution.

1177
01:18:30,254 --> 01:18:31,255
But for now, I'll settle
for this sweet little...

1178
01:18:31,589 --> 01:18:34,300
"Who's gonna get him first?"

1179
01:18:35,384 --> 01:18:37,887
So, you're on the clock.

1180
01:18:39,889 --> 01:18:40,973
What have you done?

1181
01:18:41,057 --> 01:18:42,308
I don't answer to you, lackey.

1182
01:18:42,433 --> 01:18:43,434
It's Loki.

1183
01:18:43,643 --> 01:18:45,144
And you will answer
to the Grandmaster.

1184
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:48,105
Hmm.

1185
01:18:48,397 --> 01:18:51,108
Why would you help my brother
escape with that green fool?

1186
01:18:51,525 --> 01:18:52,652
I don't help anyone.

1187
01:18:59,325 --> 01:19:00,326
You're a Valkyrie.

1188
01:19:05,414 --> 01:19:07,416
I thought the Valkyrie had
all died gruesome deaths.

1189
01:19:08,834 --> 01:19:10,336
Choose your next words wisely.

1190
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:13,756
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.

1191
01:20:06,726 --> 01:20:09,061
The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.

1192
01:20:10,396 --> 01:20:11,605
The sun's going down.

1193
01:20:11,689 --> 01:20:13,107
- It's getting real low.
- Oh, shoot.

1194
01:20:13,482 --> 01:20:15,693
- Sun's getting low.
- Would you stop saying that?

1195
01:20:15,776 --> 01:20:16,819
I just need you to stay calm.

1196
01:20:17,069 --> 01:20:18,904
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1197
01:20:19,196 --> 01:20:20,823
It's just a planet. You've
been on a planet before.

1198
01:20:20,906 --> 01:20:21,949
Yeah. One.

1199
01:20:22,283 --> 01:20:23,826
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.

1200
01:20:24,118 --> 01:20:25,244
It's a new experience.

1201
01:20:25,453 --> 01:20:27,371
My neurons,
they're firing faster

1202
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:29,457
than my brain can handle
the information.

1203
01:20:29,707 --> 01:20:31,876
The whole thing is totally
different this time.

1204
01:20:32,168 --> 01:20:33,878
In the past, I always felt
like Hulk and I

1205
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:35,254
each had a hand on the wheel.

1206
01:20:35,629 --> 01:20:37,298
But this time, it's like
he had the keys

1207
01:20:37,381 --> 01:20:38,924
to the car and I was
locked in the trunk.

1208
01:20:39,175 --> 01:20:40,968
All right, well, you're back
now. That's all that matters.

1209
01:20:41,177 --> 01:20:42,219
No, it's not what matters.

1210
01:20:42,428 --> 01:20:43,471
What I'm trying
to tell you, is that

1211
01:20:43,554 --> 01:20:45,097
if I turn into
the Hulk again...

1212
01:20:45,347 --> 01:20:46,724
Banner may never come back.

1213
01:20:47,016 --> 01:20:48,225
And we're stranded on a planet

1214
01:20:48,309 --> 01:20:50,061
that is designed
to stress me out.

1215
01:20:50,144 --> 01:20:51,270
We're not stranded.

1216
01:20:51,353 --> 01:20:52,688
I'm gonna figure out a way
to get us home.

1217
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:54,231
Thank you.

1218
01:20:54,565 --> 01:20:56,567
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.

1219
01:20:56,901 --> 01:20:57,943
What?

1220
01:20:58,194 --> 01:20:59,779
Listen, my people
are in great danger.

1221
01:21:00,362 --> 01:21:02,531
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being...

1222
01:21:02,782 --> 01:21:04,533
who also happens
to be my sister.

1223
01:21:04,784 --> 01:21:06,452
Okay, that is so wrong
on so many...

1224
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:07,745
I don't wanna
fight your sister.

1225
01:21:07,828 --> 01:21:09,080
That's a family issue.

1226
01:21:09,205 --> 01:21:10,456
No, she's an evil being.

1227
01:21:10,539 --> 01:21:12,333
I don't care what she is.

1228
01:21:12,416 --> 01:21:14,585
I'm not fighting any
more beings. I'm sick of it.

1229
01:21:14,835 --> 01:21:15,836
- What?
- I just told you.

1230
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:17,671
If I turn into the Hulk,

1231
01:21:17,755 --> 01:21:18,923
I am never gonna
come back again.

1232
01:21:19,131 --> 01:21:20,174
And you don't care.

1233
01:21:20,341 --> 01:21:22,051
No, no. I'm putting together
the team.

1234
01:21:22,343 --> 01:21:23,552
The Hulk is the fire.

1235
01:21:23,844 --> 01:21:25,513
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.

1236
01:21:25,763 --> 01:21:27,181
- What? No!
- It's gross.

1237
01:21:27,431 --> 01:21:29,100
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

1238
01:21:29,475 --> 01:21:31,102
No! I don't even
like the Hulk.

1239
01:21:31,185 --> 01:21:32,436
He's all like...

1240
01:21:32,603 --> 01:21:34,021
"Smash, smash, smash."

1241
01:21:34,271 --> 01:21:35,272
I prefer you.

1242
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:37,191
Thanks.

1243
01:21:38,067 --> 01:21:39,568
But if I'm being honest,

1244
01:21:39,652 --> 01:21:41,028
when it comes
to fighting evil beings...

1245
01:21:41,278 --> 01:21:42,571
he is very powerful
and useful.

1246
01:21:42,905 --> 01:21:44,698
Yeah, Banner's powerful
and useful, too.

1247
01:21:44,990 --> 01:21:46,075
Is he though?

1248
01:21:46,367 --> 01:21:48,369
How many PhDs
does Hulk have? Zero.

1249
01:21:48,577 --> 01:21:50,329
How many PhDs does
Banner have? Seven.

1250
01:21:51,288 --> 01:21:53,165
Fine, you don't have
to fight anyone.

1251
01:21:53,415 --> 01:21:55,209
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.

1252
01:21:59,338 --> 01:22:00,381
What are you doing with that?

1253
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:01,549
I need a disguise.
I'm a fugitive.

1254
01:22:01,632 --> 01:22:03,300
- I need a disguise.
- You are the disguise.

1255
01:22:04,176 --> 01:22:05,636
- I'll be Tony Stark.
- What?

1256
01:22:06,011 --> 01:22:07,596
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1257
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:10,307
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1258
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:11,767
Then why did you dress me up
like Tony?

1259
01:22:12,017 --> 01:22:13,018
Because you were naked.

1260
01:22:13,185 --> 01:22:14,311
Okay, I'll give you that.

1261
01:22:15,229 --> 01:22:16,438
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!

1262
01:22:16,522 --> 01:22:17,898
Tony wears his pants
super tight.

1263
01:22:17,982 --> 01:22:18,983
- Stop it!
- I'm sorry.

1264
01:22:19,316 --> 01:22:21,318
- Why are you being so weird?
- I don't know.

1265
01:22:21,610 --> 01:22:23,863
Maybe the fact that I was
trapped for two years...

1266
01:22:24,071 --> 01:22:26,490
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.

1267
01:22:26,866 --> 01:22:28,409
Hey. Shh. It's okay.

1268
01:22:28,659 --> 01:22:30,953
You're good. Calm down.
Come on.

1269
01:22:31,203 --> 01:22:32,496
Listen, we're gonna
go to Asgard...

1270
01:22:32,746 --> 01:22:33,747
and you're not gonna
have to think about

1271
01:22:33,831 --> 01:22:34,832
the Hulk ever again.

1272
01:22:35,124 --> 01:22:36,167
- All right?
- All right.

1273
01:22:40,254 --> 01:22:41,922
Hulk!

1274
01:22:43,883 --> 01:22:45,467
Oh. This is bad.

1275
01:22:49,638 --> 01:22:50,973
Banner! Banner!

1276
01:22:55,019 --> 01:22:56,061
Banner!

1277
01:23:09,742 --> 01:23:10,784
Banner!

1278
01:23:11,327 --> 01:23:12,453
Thor!

1279
01:23:23,756 --> 01:23:24,757
Hi.

1280
01:23:25,049 --> 01:23:26,050
Hi.

1281
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:27,551
I was gonna do that.

1282
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:28,761
Yeah, well, I did it first.

1283
01:23:29,136 --> 01:23:30,930
That's good.
What are you doing here?

1284
01:23:31,972 --> 01:23:33,557
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.

1285
01:23:33,766 --> 01:23:34,767
I got sidetracked.

1286
01:23:35,226 --> 01:23:36,227
What's with the...

1287
01:23:36,727 --> 01:23:37,811
It's my disguise.

1288
01:23:37,978 --> 01:23:38,979
But I can see your face.

1289
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:41,065
Not when I do this, you can't.

1290
01:23:41,857 --> 01:23:43,609
Your hair looks nice.
I like what you did with it.

1291
01:23:43,692 --> 01:23:45,110
Change it? Washed it maybe?

1292
01:23:51,325 --> 01:23:52,576
What are those things
on her eyes?

1293
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:53,994
Are those the people
that she's killed?

1294
01:23:54,245 --> 01:23:55,704
She's so beautiful and strong
and courageous.

1295
01:23:55,996 --> 01:23:56,997
Who is this guy?

1296
01:23:57,081 --> 01:23:58,082
- He's a friend.
- Who? Me?

1297
01:23:58,165 --> 01:23:59,500
- I'm Bruce.
- I feel like I know you.

1298
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:01,669
I feel like I know you, too.

1299
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:08,217
Look, I've spent years
in a haze,

1300
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:09,677
- trying to forget my past.
- Mmm.

1301
01:24:10,219 --> 01:24:11,512
Sakaar seemed like
the best place

1302
01:24:11,595 --> 01:24:13,847
to drink and forget,
and to die one day.

1303
01:24:14,223 --> 01:24:15,849
I was thinking
that you drink too much,

1304
01:24:15,933 --> 01:24:17,309
and that probably
was gonna kill you.

1305
01:24:17,476 --> 01:24:18,560
I don't plan to stop drinking.

1306
01:24:18,727 --> 01:24:20,938
- Oh.
- But I don't wanna forget.

1307
01:24:21,188 --> 01:24:22,731
I can't turn away anymore...

1308
01:24:23,482 --> 01:24:25,150
so if I'm gonna die...

1309
01:24:25,442 --> 01:24:27,027
well, it may as well be
driving my sword

1310
01:24:27,111 --> 01:24:28,487
through the heart
of that murderous hag.

1311
01:24:28,779 --> 01:24:30,239
- Good.
- Yeah.

1312
01:24:30,531 --> 01:24:33,409
So, I'm saying
that I wanna be on the team.

1313
01:24:34,118 --> 01:24:35,327
Has it got a name?

1314
01:24:35,536 --> 01:24:38,205
Yeah, it's called
the Revengers.

1315
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:39,581
Revengers?

1316
01:24:39,665 --> 01:24:42,042
Because I'm getting revenge.
You're getting revenge.

1317
01:24:43,919 --> 01:24:45,212
Do you want revenge?

1318
01:24:45,379 --> 01:24:47,506
I'm undecided.

1319
01:24:47,798 --> 01:24:48,799
Okay.

1320
01:24:49,466 --> 01:24:51,176
Also, I've got
a peace offering.

1321
01:24:54,471 --> 01:24:56,307
Surprise.

1322
01:25:02,062 --> 01:25:03,314
Ow.

1323
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:04,773
Just had to be sure.

1324
01:25:08,569 --> 01:25:09,570
Hello, Bruce.

1325
01:25:10,988 --> 01:25:12,740
So, last time I saw you,

1326
01:25:12,823 --> 01:25:13,949
you were trying
to kill everybody.

1327
01:25:14,241 --> 01:25:15,326
Where are you at these days?

1328
01:25:15,909 --> 01:25:17,619
It varies
from moment to moment.

1329
01:25:18,454 --> 01:25:19,913
Is that a Dragonfang?

1330
01:25:20,581 --> 01:25:21,665
It is.

1331
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:22,791
My God.

1332
01:25:23,876 --> 01:25:25,836
This is the famed sword
of the Valkyrie.

1333
01:25:25,919 --> 01:25:27,755
Sakaar and Asgard
are about as far apart

1334
01:25:27,838 --> 01:25:29,006
as any two known systems.

1335
01:25:29,506 --> 01:25:32,009
Our best bet is a wormhole
just outside of city limits.

1336
01:25:32,426 --> 01:25:34,303
Refuel on Xandar, and
we can be back in Asgard

1337
01:25:34,386 --> 01:25:35,846
in 18 months.

1338
01:25:36,138 --> 01:25:39,266
Nope. We are going through
the big one.

1339
01:25:39,516 --> 01:25:40,517
The Devil's Anus?

1340
01:25:40,893 --> 01:25:41,894
Anus?

1341
01:25:42,061 --> 01:25:43,062
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?

1342
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:44,271
For the record, I didn't know

1343
01:25:44,355 --> 01:25:45,356
it was called that
when I picked it.

1344
01:25:45,439 --> 01:25:47,024
That looks like
a collapsing neutron star...

1345
01:25:47,107 --> 01:25:49,526
inside of an
Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

1346
01:25:49,943 --> 01:25:51,111
We need another ship.

1347
01:25:51,195 --> 01:25:52,613
That would tear
mine to pieces.

1348
01:25:52,905 --> 01:25:54,448
She's right. We need one
that can withstand

1349
01:25:54,531 --> 01:25:55,616
the geodetic strain
from the singularity.

1350
01:25:55,908 --> 01:25:57,743
And has an offline
power steering system...

1351
01:25:57,826 --> 01:26:00,454
that could also function
without the on-board computer.

1352
01:26:00,746 --> 01:26:02,039
And we need one
with cup holders,

1353
01:26:02,122 --> 01:26:03,665
because we're gonna die.
So, drinks!

1354
01:26:04,041 --> 01:26:05,834
Do I know you?
I feel like I know you.

1355
01:26:06,085 --> 01:26:07,836
I feel like I know you, too.
It's weird.

1356
01:26:08,087 --> 01:26:09,088
What do you say?

1357
01:26:09,421 --> 01:26:10,422
Uncharted metagalactic travel

1358
01:26:10,506 --> 01:26:11,715
through a volatile
cosmic gateway.

1359
01:26:12,049 --> 01:26:13,133
Talk about an adventure.

1360
01:26:13,884 --> 01:26:15,427
- We need a ship.
- Need a ship.

1361
01:26:15,677 --> 01:26:16,678
There are one or two ships.

1362
01:26:16,762 --> 01:26:17,763
Absolute top of the line
models...

1363
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:19,223
I don't mean to impose...

1364
01:26:22,684 --> 01:26:24,228
But the Grandmaster
has a great many ships.

1365
01:26:24,937 --> 01:26:26,313
I may even have stolen

1366
01:26:26,397 --> 01:26:28,357
the access codes
to his security system.

1367
01:26:28,649 --> 01:26:29,650
And suddenly you're overcome

1368
01:26:29,733 --> 01:26:30,818
with an urge
to do the right thing.

1369
01:26:31,110 --> 01:26:32,111
Heavens, no.

1370
01:26:32,194 --> 01:26:33,821
I've run out of favor
with the Grandmaster...

1371
01:26:33,904 --> 01:26:35,739
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship...

1372
01:26:36,031 --> 01:26:39,076
I'm asking for safe passage
through the Anus.

1373
01:26:39,451 --> 01:26:40,786
You're telling us
that you can get us

1374
01:26:40,869 --> 01:26:41,995
access into the garage...

1375
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:43,705
without setting off
any alarms?

1376
01:26:44,164 --> 01:26:45,707
Yes, brother. I can.

1377
01:26:45,958 --> 01:26:48,627
Okay, can I just...
A quick FYI.

1378
01:26:48,919 --> 01:26:50,504
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago...

1379
01:26:50,754 --> 01:26:53,132
and he was totally ready
to kill any of us.

1380
01:26:53,382 --> 01:26:54,466
He did try to kill me.

1381
01:26:54,758 --> 01:26:56,468
Yes, me too.
On many, many occasions.

1382
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,220
There was one time
when we were children...

1383
01:26:58,470 --> 01:26:59,930
he transformed himself
into a snake,

1384
01:27:00,013 --> 01:27:01,140
and he knows
that I love snakes.

1385
01:27:01,390 --> 01:27:03,142
So, I went to pick up
the snake to admire it...

1386
01:27:03,392 --> 01:27:04,810
and he transformed back
into himself

1387
01:27:04,893 --> 01:27:06,019
and he was like,
"Yeah, it's me!"

1388
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:09,148
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.

1389
01:27:09,773 --> 01:27:10,816
If we're
boosting a ship...

1390
01:27:11,024 --> 01:27:12,526
we're gonna need to draw some
guards away from the palace.

1391
01:27:12,776 --> 01:27:14,069
Why not set the beast loose?

1392
01:27:14,278 --> 01:27:15,279
Shut up.

1393
01:27:15,529 --> 01:27:16,530
You guys have a beast?

1394
01:27:16,738 --> 01:27:19,032
No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.

1395
01:27:19,366 --> 01:27:20,742
We're going to start
a revolution.

1396
01:27:20,826 --> 01:27:22,286
- Revolution?
- I'll explain later.

1397
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:25,038
- Who's this guy again?
- I'll explain later.

1398
01:27:26,248 --> 01:27:28,375
Is that
some sort of protoplasm,

1399
01:27:28,459 --> 01:27:29,585
all the stuff
that's coming out of you...

1400
01:27:29,751 --> 01:27:30,919
or are they eggs?

1401
01:27:32,421 --> 01:27:33,547
Looks like eggs.

1402
01:27:35,549 --> 01:27:37,009
Oh!

1403
01:27:43,098 --> 01:27:44,308
I'm looking for Korg.

1404
01:27:44,683 --> 01:27:45,851
Who's asking?

1405
01:27:46,101 --> 01:27:47,186
I know you're asking.

1406
01:27:47,478 --> 01:27:49,354
Is anyone else asking,
or is it just you?

1407
01:27:49,688 --> 01:27:51,648
The Lord of Thunder
sends his best.

1408
01:27:55,319 --> 01:27:57,321
The revolution has begun.

1409
01:27:57,654 --> 01:27:59,573
Revolution?
How did this happen?

1410
01:27:59,865 --> 01:28:01,283
Don't know.

1411
01:28:01,575 --> 01:28:02,951
But the arena's mainframe

1412
01:28:03,035 --> 01:28:04,620
for the Obedience Disks
have been deactivated...

1413
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:06,788
and the slaves
have armed themselves.

1414
01:28:06,955 --> 01:28:08,916
Oh. I don't like that word.

1415
01:28:09,166 --> 01:28:10,375
Which? Mainframe?

1416
01:28:10,626 --> 01:28:12,628
No. Why would I not like
"mainframe"?

1417
01:28:12,878 --> 01:28:14,838
No, the "S" word.

1418
01:28:15,088 --> 01:28:17,633
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs
have armed themselves.

1419
01:28:19,176 --> 01:28:20,385
Okay, that's better.

1420
01:28:26,683 --> 01:28:28,393
Hey, so, listen.
We should talk.

1421
01:28:29,853 --> 01:28:30,896
I disagree.

1422
01:28:31,396 --> 01:28:34,191
Open communication
was never our family's forte.

1423
01:28:34,566 --> 01:28:35,567
You have no idea.

1424
01:28:35,734 --> 01:28:38,320
Been quite the revelation
since we last spoke.

1425
01:28:38,403 --> 01:28:39,404
Hello.

1426
01:28:40,489 --> 01:28:41,490
Hi.

1427
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:50,123
Odin brought us together.

1428
01:28:51,208 --> 01:28:54,002
It's almost poetic that his
death should split us apart.

1429
01:29:00,133 --> 01:29:02,135
We might as well be
strangers now.

1430
01:29:02,386 --> 01:29:05,347
Two sons of the crown,
set adrift.

1431
01:29:05,681 --> 01:29:07,599
Oh.

1432
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,018
Thought you didn't
wanna talk about it.

1433
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:12,521
Here's the thing.

1434
01:29:12,896 --> 01:29:14,565
I'm probably better off
staying here on Sakaar.

1435
01:29:14,773 --> 01:29:16,400
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

1436
01:29:18,443 --> 01:29:19,736
Did you just agree with me?

1437
01:29:20,028 --> 01:29:21,488
Come on, this place
is perfect for you.

1438
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:23,365
It's savage,
chaotic, lawless...

1439
01:29:23,574 --> 01:29:25,158
Brother, you're gonna do
great here.

1440
01:29:25,409 --> 01:29:26,994
Do you truly think
so little of me?

1441
01:29:29,246 --> 01:29:30,872
Loki, I thought
the world of you.

1442
01:29:32,082 --> 01:29:34,543
I thought we were gonna fight
side by side forever.

1443
01:29:34,835 --> 01:29:37,546
But at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.

1444
01:29:38,338 --> 01:29:40,716
I don't know, maybe
there's still good in you.

1445
01:29:40,966 --> 01:29:42,134
But let's be honest,

1446
01:29:42,217 --> 01:29:44,386
our paths diverged
a long time ago.

1447
01:29:49,182 --> 01:29:50,183
Yeah.

1448
01:29:51,393 --> 01:29:52,436
It's probably for the best

1449
01:29:52,519 --> 01:29:53,645
that we never
see each other again.

1450
01:29:53,937 --> 01:29:55,022
That's what you always wanted.

1451
01:29:59,443 --> 01:30:01,028
Hey, let's do "Get Help."

1452
01:30:01,278 --> 01:30:02,279
- What?
- "Get Help."

1453
01:30:02,362 --> 01:30:03,363
No.

1454
01:30:03,447 --> 01:30:04,448
- Come on, you love it.
- I hate it.

1455
01:30:04,531 --> 01:30:05,532
It's great.
It works every time.

1456
01:30:05,616 --> 01:30:07,242
- It's humiliating.
- Do you have a better plan?

1457
01:30:07,326 --> 01:30:08,869
- No.
- We're doing it.

1458
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:10,704
We are not doing "Get Help."

1459
01:30:11,330 --> 01:30:12,998
Get help! Please!

1460
01:30:13,248 --> 01:30:14,249
My brother, he's dying.

1461
01:30:14,458 --> 01:30:16,376
Get help! Help him!

1462
01:30:18,545 --> 01:30:19,671
Classic.

1463
01:30:19,838 --> 01:30:21,173
Still hate it.

1464
01:30:21,381 --> 01:30:23,634
- It's humiliating.
- Not for me, it's not.

1465
01:30:23,884 --> 01:30:25,927
Now, which one's the ship
she told us to get?

1466
01:30:26,011 --> 01:30:27,012
<i>The Commodore.</i>

1467
01:30:27,929 --> 01:30:28,930
Right.

1468
01:30:31,683 --> 01:30:34,186
Though I feel it won't make
much of a difference.

1469
01:30:36,438 --> 01:30:38,106
Oh, Loki.

1470
01:30:39,358 --> 01:30:40,609
I know I've betrayed you
many times before...

1471
01:30:40,859 --> 01:30:42,402
but this time
it's truly nothing personal.

1472
01:30:42,736 --> 01:30:44,529
The reward for your capture

1473
01:30:44,613 --> 01:30:45,697
will set me up nicely.

1474
01:30:45,989 --> 01:30:47,407
Never one for sentiment,
were you?

1475
01:30:47,783 --> 01:30:49,034
Easier to let it burn.

1476
01:30:49,368 --> 01:30:50,369
I agree.

1477
01:30:59,044 --> 01:31:00,545
Oh, that looks painful.

1478
01:31:01,338 --> 01:31:04,007
Oh, dear brother,
you're becoming predictable.

1479
01:31:04,383 --> 01:31:06,176
I trust you, you betray me.

1480
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:08,428
Round and round
in circles we go.

1481
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:10,597
See, Loki, life is about,
it's about growth.

1482
01:31:10,889 --> 01:31:12,015
It's about change.

1483
01:31:12,265 --> 01:31:15,227
But you seem to
just wanna stay the same.

1484
01:31:16,019 --> 01:31:17,562
I guess
what I'm trying to say...

1485
01:31:17,813 --> 01:31:20,649
is that you'll always be
the God of Mischief...

1486
01:31:20,941 --> 01:31:22,275
but you could be more.

1487
01:31:24,903 --> 01:31:26,822
I'll just put this over here
for you.

1488
01:31:27,447 --> 01:31:30,784
Anyway, all got places to be,
so good luck.

1489
01:31:36,248 --> 01:31:37,499
All right,
I can figure this out.

1490
01:31:37,958 --> 01:31:39,710
It's just another spaceship.

1491
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:54,433
<i>Loyal Sakaarians...</i>

1492
01:31:54,683 --> 01:31:56,560
<i>Lord of Thunder
has stolen my ship</i>

1493
01:31:56,643 --> 01:31:58,019
<i>and my favorite champion.</i>

1494
01:31:59,646 --> 01:32:02,733
<i>Sakaarians, take to the skies.
Bring him down.</i>

1495
01:32:02,941 --> 01:32:04,568
<i>Do not let him
leave this planet.</i>

1496
01:32:17,789 --> 01:32:19,040
- Good shot!
- Thanks.

1497
01:32:22,127 --> 01:32:23,128
<i>Open the doors.</i>

1498
01:32:23,211 --> 01:32:24,504
Okay.

1499
01:32:29,885 --> 01:32:31,636
I hope that you're tougher
than you look.

1500
01:32:31,803 --> 01:32:32,846
Why?

1501
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,110
Shouldn't we be shooting back
or something?

1502
01:32:47,194 --> 01:32:48,195
Yes, we should.

1503
01:32:48,528 --> 01:32:50,280
Where are the guns
on this ship?

1504
01:32:50,572 --> 01:32:51,865
<i>There aren't any.</i>

1505
01:32:52,115 --> 01:32:53,575
- It's a leisure vessel.
<i>- What?</i>

1506
01:32:53,867 --> 01:32:55,368
Grandmaster uses it
for his good times,

1507
01:32:55,494 --> 01:32:56,495
orgies and stuff.

1508
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:58,163
Did she just say
the Grandmaster

1509
01:32:58,246 --> 01:32:59,372
uses it for orgies?

1510
01:32:59,623 --> 01:33:00,749
Yeah.

1511
01:33:00,999 --> 01:33:02,292
Don't touch anything.

1512
01:33:22,729 --> 01:33:24,022
No!

1513
01:33:27,025 --> 01:33:28,026
- No!
- No!

1514
01:33:35,033 --> 01:33:36,076
Get inside!

1515
01:33:36,368 --> 01:33:37,786
In a minute.

1516
01:33:49,214 --> 01:33:51,049
I should probably go and help.
Here, take the wheel.

1517
01:33:51,132 --> 01:33:52,509
No. I don't know
how to fly one of these.

1518
01:33:52,801 --> 01:33:54,553
You're a scientist.
Use one of your PhDs.

1519
01:33:54,636 --> 01:33:57,848
None of them are for flying
alien spaceships!

1520
01:34:32,632 --> 01:34:33,633
Okay, come on.

1521
01:34:33,717 --> 01:34:35,760
There's gotta be a gun
on this thing.

1522
01:34:35,886 --> 01:34:36,887
That looks like a gun.

1523
01:34:38,221 --> 01:34:39,514
<i>It's my birthday</i>

1524
01:34:39,598 --> 01:34:40,640
<i>It's my birthday</i>

1525
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:42,601
<i>It's my birthday</i>

1526
01:34:50,650 --> 01:34:51,735
Yeah!

1527
01:35:09,294 --> 01:35:11,379
Guys, we're coming up
on the Devil's Anus!

1528
01:35:18,178 --> 01:35:19,179
There she is.

1529
01:35:19,471 --> 01:35:21,306
Our ticket out of here.

1530
01:35:21,973 --> 01:35:23,141
Hey, what's this?

1531
01:35:28,188 --> 01:35:29,272
Thank you.

1532
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:31,858
Hey, man. We're about to jump
on that ginormous spaceship.

1533
01:35:31,942 --> 01:35:32,943
You wanna come?

1534
01:35:33,318 --> 01:35:35,946
You do seem like

1535
01:35:36,029 --> 01:35:37,530
you're in desperate need
of leadership.

1536
01:35:37,948 --> 01:35:39,366
Why, thank you.

1537
01:35:43,244 --> 01:35:44,245
Here we go.

1538
01:35:50,794 --> 01:35:51,795
Shit.

1539
01:36:09,354 --> 01:36:11,064
Asgardians...

1540
01:36:11,314 --> 01:36:13,733
some misguided soul...

1541
01:36:14,693 --> 01:36:16,569
has stolen the Bifrost sword.

1542
01:36:16,903 --> 01:36:19,114
Tell us where it is...

1543
01:36:19,406 --> 01:36:21,908
or there will be consequences.

1544
01:36:25,745 --> 01:36:26,871
Bad ones.

1545
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,209
Well?

1546
01:36:38,341 --> 01:36:39,342
You.

1547
01:37:15,587 --> 01:37:19,549
Well? Executioner?

1548
01:37:24,596 --> 01:37:25,805
Wait!

1549
01:37:25,889 --> 01:37:26,890
Wait!

1550
01:37:29,267 --> 01:37:30,435
I know where the sword is.

1551
01:38:13,686 --> 01:38:15,855
I never thought
I'd be back here.

1552
01:38:19,526 --> 01:38:20,985
I thought
it'd be a lot nicer.

1553
01:38:21,528 --> 01:38:22,987
I mean,
not that it's not nice.

1554
01:38:23,071 --> 01:38:24,447
It's just, it's on fire.

1555
01:38:24,697 --> 01:38:25,698
Here, up here
in the mountains.

1556
01:38:26,157 --> 01:38:28,243
Heat signatures.
People clustered together.

1557
01:38:28,409 --> 01:38:29,410
She's coming for them.

1558
01:38:29,702 --> 01:38:30,703
Okay, drop me off
at the palace

1559
01:38:30,787 --> 01:38:32,914
- and I'll draw her away.
- And get yourself killed?

1560
01:38:33,123 --> 01:38:34,791
The people trapped down there
are all that matters.

1561
01:38:34,874 --> 01:38:36,209
While I'm dealing with Hela,
I need you two

1562
01:38:36,292 --> 01:38:37,377
to help get
everyone off Asgard.

1563
01:38:37,836 --> 01:38:39,462
How the hell are we supposed
to do that?

1564
01:38:40,130 --> 01:38:41,673
I have a man on the ground.

1565
01:38:47,554 --> 01:38:48,555
Asgard.

1566
01:38:52,183 --> 01:38:53,351
She's here.

1567
01:39:05,071 --> 01:39:06,656
Now the ship has a gun.

1568
01:39:06,906 --> 01:39:07,991
I'll take it from here.

1569
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:11,828
I found this in the armory.

1570
01:39:15,206 --> 01:39:16,207
Good luck.

1571
01:39:17,917 --> 01:39:19,085
Your Majesty...

1572
01:39:21,171 --> 01:39:22,213
don't die.

1573
01:39:25,216 --> 01:39:26,843
You know what I mean.

1574
01:40:25,902 --> 01:40:27,654
We must keep moving!

1575
01:40:28,446 --> 01:40:30,031
Go to the Bifrost!

1576
01:41:12,824 --> 01:41:13,908
Sister.

1577
01:41:16,202 --> 01:41:17,829
You're still alive.

1578
01:41:18,121 --> 01:41:19,998
I love what you've done
with the place.

1579
01:41:20,081 --> 01:41:21,416
Redecorating, I see.

1580
01:41:21,791 --> 01:41:23,835
It seems our father's solution

1581
01:41:23,918 --> 01:41:26,379
to every problem
was to cover it up.

1582
01:41:28,006 --> 01:41:29,507
Or to cast it out.

1583
01:41:31,843 --> 01:41:35,263
He told you you were worthy.
He said the same thing to me.

1584
01:41:35,972 --> 01:41:37,223
You see?

1585
01:41:37,974 --> 01:41:40,018
You never knew him.

1586
01:41:40,435 --> 01:41:42,186
Not at his best.

1587
01:41:42,478 --> 01:41:45,356
Odin and I drowned
entire civilizations

1588
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:46,941
in blood and tears.

1589
01:41:47,233 --> 01:41:50,028
Where do you think
all this gold came from?

1590
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:51,904
And then, one day...

1591
01:41:52,196 --> 01:41:55,074
he decided to become
a benevolent king.

1592
01:41:55,408 --> 01:41:57,910
To foster peace,
to protect life...

1593
01:41:59,162 --> 01:42:00,621
to have you.

1594
01:42:01,164 --> 01:42:03,458
I understand why you're angry.

1595
01:42:03,708 --> 01:42:05,168
And you are my sister,
and technically

1596
01:42:05,251 --> 01:42:07,545
have a claim to the throne.

1597
01:42:07,795 --> 01:42:09,714
And believe me, I would love
for someone else to rule.

1598
01:42:09,797 --> 01:42:10,923
But it can't be you.

1599
01:42:11,174 --> 01:42:14,677
You're just...
The worst.

1600
01:42:16,346 --> 01:42:17,889
Okay, get up.

1601
01:42:18,264 --> 01:42:20,141
You're in my seat.

1602
01:42:21,309 --> 01:42:23,186
You know,
Father once told me...

1603
01:42:23,436 --> 01:42:25,897
that a wise king
never seeks out war.

1604
01:42:26,147 --> 01:42:28,566
But must always
be ready for it.

1605
01:43:00,973 --> 01:43:02,225
Go back!

1606
01:43:07,397 --> 01:43:08,648
Go!

1607
01:43:43,808 --> 01:43:46,185
To be honest, I expected more.

1608
01:43:49,439 --> 01:43:50,440
Heimdall!

1609
01:43:52,775 --> 01:43:54,402
The sword!

1610
01:43:58,990 --> 01:44:00,450
Here's the difference
between us.

1611
01:44:00,783 --> 01:44:02,243
I'm Odin's firstborn...

1612
01:44:02,493 --> 01:44:04,787
the rightful heir,
the savior of Asgard.

1613
01:44:05,079 --> 01:44:06,789
And you're nothing.

1614
01:44:17,049 --> 01:44:19,844
So simple,
even a blind man could see it.

1615
01:44:22,138 --> 01:44:23,139
Oh.

1616
01:44:23,681 --> 01:44:25,808
Now you remind me of Dad.

1617
01:44:36,194 --> 01:44:37,862
The stupid dog won't die!

1618
01:44:59,967 --> 01:45:02,678
Everything's gonna be
all right now. I got this.

1619
01:45:03,179 --> 01:45:05,139
You wanted to know who I am?

1620
01:45:06,224 --> 01:45:07,725
What the hell
are you talking about?

1621
01:45:08,017 --> 01:45:09,310
You'll see!

1622
01:45:58,067 --> 01:46:00,194
You see?
No one's going anywhere.

1623
01:46:00,486 --> 01:46:01,779
I'll get that sword...

1624
01:46:01,946 --> 01:46:04,574
even if I have to kill every
single one of them to do it.

1625
01:46:31,392 --> 01:46:32,643
Hey, man.

1626
01:46:33,936 --> 01:46:35,187
I'm Korg. This is Miek.

1627
01:46:35,438 --> 01:46:36,564
We're gonna jump
on that spaceship

1628
01:46:36,647 --> 01:46:37,732
and get out of here.
Wanna come?

1629
01:46:47,366 --> 01:46:51,120
Your savior is here.

1630
01:46:58,753 --> 01:47:00,463
Did you miss me?

1631
01:47:00,796 --> 01:47:02,006
Everyone, on that ship now.

1632
01:47:06,552 --> 01:47:08,596
Welcome home.
I saw you coming.

1633
01:47:08,888 --> 01:47:09,889
Of course you did.

1634
01:47:26,739 --> 01:47:28,824
It's a valiant effort,
but you never stood a chance.

1635
01:47:29,992 --> 01:47:31,035
You see...

1636
01:47:31,911 --> 01:47:34,580
I'm not a queen or a monster.

1637
01:47:36,707 --> 01:47:38,250
I'm the Goddess of Death.

1638
01:47:39,502 --> 01:47:41,587
What were you
the god of, again?

1639
01:47:53,224 --> 01:47:54,934
Even when you had two eyes...

1640
01:47:55,810 --> 01:47:57,520
you'd see
only half the picture.

1641
01:47:59,063 --> 01:48:01,899
She's too strong.
Without my hammer, I can't.

1642
01:48:03,275 --> 01:48:06,654
Are you Thor,
the God of Hammers? Hmm?

1643
01:48:09,907 --> 01:48:12,201
That hammer was to help you
control your power,

1644
01:48:12,284 --> 01:48:13,536
to focus it.

1645
01:48:14,453 --> 01:48:16,038
It was never your source
of strength.

1646
01:48:16,956 --> 01:48:19,083
It's too late.
She's already taken Asgard.

1647
01:48:20,334 --> 01:48:22,878
Asgard is not a place.
Never was.

1648
01:48:24,255 --> 01:48:25,339
This could be Asgard.

1649
01:48:26,716 --> 01:48:28,718
Asgard is where
our people stand.

1650
01:48:29,719 --> 01:48:34,348
Even now, right now,
those people need your help.

1651
01:48:42,189 --> 01:48:44,191
I'm not as strong as you.

1652
01:48:47,069 --> 01:48:48,070
No...

1653
01:48:49,488 --> 01:48:50,740
you're stronger.

1654
01:48:59,874 --> 01:49:01,125
Tell me, brother.

1655
01:49:01,208 --> 01:49:03,544
What were you
the god of again?

1656
01:51:19,221 --> 01:51:21,265
- You're late.
- You're missing an eye.

1657
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:22,933
This isn't over.

1658
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:31,817
I think we should
disband the Revengers.

1659
01:51:33,485 --> 01:51:34,528
Hit her
with a lightning blast.

1660
01:51:34,820 --> 01:51:35,946
I just hit her with
the biggest lightning blast

1661
01:51:36,030 --> 01:51:37,156
in the history of lightning.

1662
01:51:37,239 --> 01:51:38,240
It did nothing.

1663
01:51:42,036 --> 01:51:44,538
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.

1664
01:51:45,331 --> 01:51:46,707
It won't end there.

1665
01:51:47,166 --> 01:51:50,419
The longer Hela's on Asgard,
the more powerful she grows.

1666
01:51:50,753 --> 01:51:52,338
She'll hunt us down.

1667
01:51:52,546 --> 01:51:53,964
We need to stop her
here and now.

1668
01:51:54,256 --> 01:51:55,299
So what do we do?

1669
01:51:56,300 --> 01:51:57,635
I'm not doing "Get Help."

1670
01:52:10,022 --> 01:52:13,150
Asgard's not a place,
it's a people.

1671
01:52:15,194 --> 01:52:16,195
Loki...

1672
01:52:16,528 --> 01:52:18,364
this was never about
stopping Ragnarok.

1673
01:52:18,697 --> 01:52:20,574
This was about
causing Ragnarok.

1674
01:52:20,783 --> 01:52:22,284
Surtur's crown, the vault.

1675
01:52:24,161 --> 01:52:25,371
It's the only way.

1676
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:27,414
Bold move, brother.

1677
01:52:28,832 --> 01:52:30,167
Even for me.

1678
01:52:33,462 --> 01:52:34,463
Shall we?

1679
01:52:35,631 --> 01:52:36,632
After you.

1680
01:53:02,324 --> 01:53:03,659
This is madness.

1681
01:53:17,214 --> 01:53:18,716
Go! Go, now!

1682
01:54:19,985 --> 01:54:21,278
For Asgard.

1683
01:54:35,709 --> 01:54:36,919
Hela!

1684
01:55:01,652 --> 01:55:05,656
With the Eternal Flame,
you are reborn.

1685
01:55:16,917 --> 01:55:18,418
Hela, enough!

1686
01:55:22,256 --> 01:55:24,883
You want Asgard, it's yours.

1687
01:55:25,384 --> 01:55:28,595
Whatever game you're playing,
it won't work.

1688
01:55:28,846 --> 01:55:30,264
You can't defeat me.

1689
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:32,391
No, I know.

1690
01:55:34,101 --> 01:55:35,102
But he can.

1691
01:55:39,606 --> 01:55:40,691
No.

1692
01:55:48,782 --> 01:55:52,077
Tremble before me, Asgard!

1693
01:55:52,327 --> 01:55:54,454
I am your reckoning!

1694
01:56:03,964 --> 01:56:05,382
The people are safe.

1695
01:56:06,133 --> 01:56:07,801
That's all that matters.

1696
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:10,929
We're fulfilling
the prophecy.

1697
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:12,931
I hate this prophecy.

1698
01:56:13,223 --> 01:56:14,892
So do I,
but we have no choice.

1699
01:56:15,184 --> 01:56:16,852
Surtur destroys Asgard...

1700
01:56:17,144 --> 01:56:19,354
he destroys Hela,
so that our people may live.

1701
01:56:19,479 --> 01:56:21,064
But we need to let him
finish the job,

1702
01:56:21,148 --> 01:56:22,232
otherwise...

1703
01:56:23,984 --> 01:56:24,985
No!

1704
01:56:27,487 --> 01:56:29,323
Hulk, stop, you moron!

1705
01:56:38,540 --> 01:56:39,583
Hulk, stop.

1706
01:56:39,833 --> 01:56:42,669
Just for once in your life,
don't smash.

1707
01:56:44,046 --> 01:56:45,631
Big monster!

1708
01:56:46,089 --> 01:56:47,174
Let's go!

1709
01:56:49,051 --> 01:56:50,052
Fine.

1710
01:57:14,243 --> 01:57:16,912
I am Asgard's doom!

1711
01:57:40,102 --> 01:57:42,062
The damage is not too bad.

1712
01:57:42,354 --> 01:57:44,231
As long as the foundations
are still strong...

1713
01:57:44,523 --> 01:57:45,857
we can rebuild this place.

1714
01:57:46,316 --> 01:57:48,402
It will become a haven...

1715
01:57:48,694 --> 01:57:51,405
for all peoples and aliens
of the universe.

1716
01:57:58,453 --> 01:58:00,789
Now those foundations
are gone. Sorry.

1717
01:58:16,013 --> 01:58:17,806
What have I done?

1718
01:58:19,099 --> 01:58:21,393
You saved us from extinction.

1719
01:58:21,685 --> 01:58:23,270
Asgard is not a place...

1720
01:58:25,063 --> 01:58:26,606
it's a people.

1721
01:58:55,927 --> 01:58:57,346
It suits you.

1722
01:59:00,223 --> 01:59:02,559
Maybe you're not so bad
after all, brother.

1723
01:59:03,018 --> 01:59:04,061
Maybe not.

1724
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:06,563
Thank you.

1725
01:59:07,481 --> 01:59:09,649
If you were here,
I might even give you a hug.

1726
01:59:14,154 --> 01:59:15,322
I'm here.

1727
01:59:39,554 --> 01:59:40,806
Your throne.

1728
01:59:56,113 --> 01:59:59,032
So. King of Asgard.

1729
02:00:09,709 --> 02:00:10,710
Where to?

1730
02:00:11,962 --> 02:00:13,213
I'm not sure.

1731
02:00:13,964 --> 02:00:15,048
Any suggestions?

1732
02:00:17,926 --> 02:00:19,636
Miek, where are you from?

1733
02:00:20,011 --> 02:00:21,805
Oh, Miek's dead.

1734
02:00:22,097 --> 02:00:25,100
Yeah, no, I accidentally
stomped on him on the bridge.

1735
02:00:25,267 --> 02:00:26,601
I've just felt so guilty,

1736
02:00:26,685 --> 02:00:27,853
I've been carrying him around
all day.

1737
02:00:30,021 --> 02:00:31,940
Miek, you're alive!

1738
02:00:32,023 --> 02:00:33,191
He's alive, guys.

1739
02:00:33,275 --> 02:00:34,443
What was
your question again, bro?

1740
02:00:36,278 --> 02:00:37,279
Earth it is.

1741
02:02:54,084 --> 02:02:55,502
Do you really think
it's a good idea

1742
02:02:55,585 --> 02:02:56,670
to go back to Earth?

1743
02:02:57,254 --> 02:02:58,255
Yes, of course.

1744
02:02:58,338 --> 02:03:00,424
The people of Earth love me.
I'm very popular.

1745
02:03:00,966 --> 02:03:02,759
Let me rephrase that.

1746
02:03:03,135 --> 02:03:04,928
Do you really think
it's a good idea

1747
02:03:05,012 --> 02:03:06,388
to bring me back to Earth?

1748
02:03:07,055 --> 02:03:09,016
Probably not, to be honest.

1749
02:03:09,099 --> 02:03:10,809
I wouldn't worry, brother.

1750
02:03:10,892 --> 02:03:13,895
I feel like everything's
gonna work out fine.

1751
02:09:42,992 --> 02:09:43,993
Oh, boy.

1752
02:09:50,583 --> 02:09:52,293
Oh.

1753
02:09:52,377 --> 02:09:56,381
I just gotta say,
I'm proud of you all.

1754
02:09:56,798 --> 02:10:00,009
This revolution has been
a huge success. Yay, us!

1755
02:10:00,385 --> 02:10:02,762
Pat on the back.
Pat on the back.

1756
02:10:02,846 --> 02:10:05,098
Come on. No?

1757
02:10:05,640 --> 02:10:07,642
Me too. 'Cause I've been
a big part of it.

1758
02:10:07,725 --> 02:10:10,520
Can't have a revolution
without somebody to overthrow.

1759
02:10:10,603 --> 02:10:12,480
So, you're welcome.

1760
02:10:12,772 --> 02:10:15,024
And, uh, it's a tie.
