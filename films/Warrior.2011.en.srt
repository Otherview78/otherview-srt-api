1
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:08,528
Hey, Jenny.
That was a wonderful share, tonight.

2
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:23,751
<i>"Chapter 36, The Quarter-Deck.</i>

3
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:26,504
<i>"Enter Ahab. Then, all.</i>

4
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:30,008
<i>"It was not a great while
after the affair of the pipe,</i>

5
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:33,761
<i>"that one morning, shortly after breakfast,
Ahab, as was his won't,</i>

6
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:36,556
<i>"ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck.</i>

7
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:59,329
<i>"'It's a white whale, I say, ' resumed Ahab,
as he threw down the top-maul.</i>

8
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:03,416
<i>"'A white whale.
Skin your eyes for him, men,</i>

9
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,045
<i>"'look sharp for white water,

10
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,822
Tommy?

11
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,201
Jesus!

12
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:46,584
What are you doing here?

13
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:49,003
Well, I was just passing through

14
00:02:49,587 --> 00:02:52,924
and I figured why not have a belt
with the old man.

15
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:54,759
Yeah.

16
00:02:57,929 --> 00:02:59,597
She looks good.

17
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:03,560
Yeah, she's hanging in there.

18
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:07,605
Well, you always did take good care of her.

19
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:10,567
Paddy Conlon.

20
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,279
Man of priorities.

21
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,789
I got a little something for you.

22
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:27,959
Mom always said,
"Never go anywhere empty-handed."

23
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,294
She did.

24
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:33,131
That's not for me anymore, Tommy.

25
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:38,845
What? You changed brands?

26
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:44,225
Let's go inside, huh?

27
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:46,811
Tommy!

28
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:50,481
Come on, let's go inside.

29
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:15,340
I like what you've done with the place.

30
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:17,884
Yeah, I appreciate that.

31
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,013
There's not much of a woman's touch
around here.

32
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,849
Yeah, well...

33
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,603
And no more women for me, Tommy.

34
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:31,314
Yeah.

35
00:04:31,773 --> 00:04:35,610
It must be hard to find a girl
who can take a punch nowadays.

36
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,785
Here you go.

37
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,455
Coffee?

38
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:52,377
You haven't seen a guy in 14 years
and you're not gonna have a drink with him?

39
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,587
- Come on.
- I told you, I'm off it, Tommy.

40
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:56,547
I'm coming up on 1,000 days.

41
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:03,554
- Come on, it's just a drink.
- No.

42
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:34,168
He's a school teacher down in Philly.

43
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,422
Remember Tess?

44
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:40,216
They had two beautiful little girls.

45
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:09,704
So, you found God, huh? That's awesome.

46
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,541
I think Mom kept calling out for him,
but he wasn't around.

47
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:20,006
I guess Jesus was down at the mill
forgiving all the drunks, huh?

48
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,426
Who knew?

49
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:32,059
So, you gonna ask about her,

50
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:34,979
or you just gonna sit there all sober?

51
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:39,692
- I know.
- You know? What do you know? Huh?

52
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,987
Do you know it wasn't enough to drive west
to get away from you,

53
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,781
that once we hit the water,
we drove north, too?

54
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:49,577
When I got sober, I hired a man to find you.

55
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:52,955
And is that one of the 12 steps?

56
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:56,209
Or does a guy like you get 24?

57
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:00,505
Just 12.

58
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:08,596
Did your guy tell you
what you needed to know?

59
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:12,350
Just that your mother died in Tacoma.

60
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:15,561
But you were in the Marines.

61
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:17,813
That was all.

62
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:20,566
That was enough.

63
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,072
Well, that's too bad,

64
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:30,368
'cause you could've gotten
some good details.

65
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:35,414
You could've heard about her
coughing up blood on her knees

66
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:38,376
in a shit box with no heat.

67
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:45,091
Having me rub her down with holy water,
because, well, she didn't have no insurance.

68
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:50,846
All the time waiting for your pal,
Jesus, to save her.

69
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:54,642
Did your man tell you that?

70
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,314
I'm sorry, Tommy.

71
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:10,574
Well, it's good to know
that you're sorry, Pop.

72
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,704
It goes a long way.

73
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:24,171
I think I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

74
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:40,354
All right, then. All right, all right, all right.

75
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:42,064
You say I can, but you say I can't.

76
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:45,359
- What about if we all get a unicorn?
- No.

77
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:46,986
- Don't you want a unicorn?
- No.

78
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:52,616
What's going on up here?

79
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,368
- Oh, my goodness.
- Well, I'm not sure,

80
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:58,080
but I think Daddy is now a princess.

81
00:08:58,164 --> 00:09:00,958
- Daddy, you look so handsome.
- Do I?

82
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,793
- He's a very pretty princess.
- We're painting Daddy's face.

83
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:04,962
Yeah, you are.

84
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:10,968
Okay. Yeah.
Em, you wanna open your presents?

85
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:15,222
- Yeah? You wanna do present time? Okay.
- Yeah. All right, come on. Ready?

86
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:17,892
- All right! It's time for presents!
- I have to put this down.

87
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,935
- Here. You wanna put it down?
- Presents time!

88
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:21,937
- Everybody, come bring your presents!
- What is it? What is it?

89
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:25,816
Let's start with this one.
How about that, Emily?

90
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:28,152
- All right.
- Happy birthday, Emily.

91
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:30,863
- What did you get? What did you get?
- Babe?

92
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,657
It's an awfully big box.

93
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:35,534
It's her birthday. Come on.

94
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,370
I know, babe,
but that's why you call it a budget.

95
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:40,039
You set it and you don't budge.

96
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,041
- This one's mine.
- Hey, open the big box!

97
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,584
It's okay.

98
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:49,215
- I love you. Be good, okay?
- Bye, Mommy.

99
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,550
Daddy's gonna give you a bath.

100
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,054
- Hey, babe. I'm late.
- Hey.

101
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:57,556
Mom's saying goodbye to the girls,
she's got to get on the road.

102
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,018
- They've been fed, they just need a bath.
- I'm on it.

103
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:03,437
Okay, can you get them to bed
at a reasonable time tonight?

104
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:04,772
Because, after the party,
they're just exhausted.

105
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:07,149
Where's the rest of that skirt?

106
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:08,567
Babe.

107
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:10,945
Listen, if any guys give you a hassle
in that joint tonight,

108
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:12,405
you give me a call, okay?

109
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:14,365
Yeah, just like you gave me a call
when those Temple frat boys

110
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,200
decided to smash up your face.

111
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,452
I told you, most nights,
I sit on the stool and grade papers,

112
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:21,622
but, every now and then,
I need some action.

113
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:26,627
All right. Well, wait up for me tonight.
I'll see what I can do about that.

114
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,379
Promises, promises.

115
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:36,929
<i>And we return here on</i> MMA Live,

116
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:40,349
<i>Jon Anik, alongside the billionaire
fighting promoter, J.J. Riley,</i>

117
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,476
<i>the Tapout crew is here,
Punk and Skrape are in the building.</i>

118
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:44,478
<i>Now, J.J., what led to this project</i>

119
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:47,022
<i>that is really redefining
mixed martial arts here in the States?</i>

120
00:10:47,398 --> 00:10:50,568
<i>Well, mixed martial arts is a sport
I've been incredibly passionate about,</i>

121
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,320
<i>and as far as where
the idea for Sparta came from,</i>

122
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:57,199
<i>I've always really dug the Grand Prix format,
so I tracked these guys down.</i>

123
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,452
<i>And when J.J. came to us,
he said he wanted to create</i>

124
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:01,078
<i>the Superbowl of mixed martial arts.</i>

125
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:04,248
<i>And he decided to put up
the $5 million purse, too.</i>

126

129
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,802
Doing good. One more time.

130
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,929
Fitzy still own this?

131
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:22,266
I don't know no Fitzy.
Colt Boyd owns this gym.

132
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,019
Can I help you with something?

133
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,606
How does it work?

134
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,608
Thirty-five a month with locker.

135
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,861
We're open at 7:00, lights out at 11 :00.

136
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,364
So you want to join?

137
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:38,949
Sure.

138
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:43,746
Put your name and contact info on the card.

139
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,874
Thank you.

140
00:11:57,843 --> 00:12:00,888
All right. There's a lesson in this, too, okay?

141
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,223
Hold on, Tito.

142
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:03,516
So, we have a body at rest,

143
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,101
and you have the bat which needs...

144
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:08,062
- Acceleration.
- Acceleration, okay.

145
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:10,481
If you have enough acceleration,

146
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,149
you might have a chance
of breaking the body at rest.

147
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:13,859
- Okay. All right. You ready?
- Piece of cake.

148
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:16,529
Everybody got the glasses on? Okay, go!
Piece of cake!

149
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,072
Come on, man!

150
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:20,908
Come on, son!

151
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:26,830
All right! All right. There we go.
Well done, Tito. Well done.

152
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:29,833
Remind me not to mess with you.

153
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,879
Sit down, everybody. Dial it down.

154
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,257
So, have we got it?

155
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,968
Force equals mass times acceleration,
we got it.

156
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,511
All right. Has everybody else got it?

157
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,680
- Yeah.
- Yes? Okay, good. All right.

158
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:44,515
The third law...

159
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,684
How many laws this dude got?

160
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:48,602
- The dude?
- Yes, the dude.

161
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:50,563
The dude has three, all right?

162
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:54,525
Newton, the dude, says that
for every action,

163
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,529
there is an equal and opposite reaction.

164
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:00,948
For example,

165
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:05,202
if K.C. does not stop the action
of sending texts in class

166
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,997
and tell her posse outside to beat it,

167
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,834
then my reaction might be
to send her down to Principal Zito's office.

168
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:15,212
Thus setting the world back
in proper balance.

169
00:13:15,337 --> 00:13:16,547
Mr. C, I put it away.

170
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:23,053
All right, before you go,
I have your tests from last week.

171
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:26,015
Just work it out.

172
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:27,683
Stop clowning.

173
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:29,935
Pick up the hands.

174
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:34,732
Tighten it up!

175
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:37,776
Use your right.

176
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:40,404
Seal his hands, come on.

177
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,157
Seal his hands. Keep your hands up!

178
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,200
Go light!

179
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,245
I said, go light!

180
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,334
God damn it!

181
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,378
Where do you find these girls?

182
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:01,383
We got a tournament coming up,
you're gonna play every guy in the 'Burgh?

183
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:03,469
Oh, jeez.

184
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,554
Fenroy, get me some ice.

185
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,349
And call that Puerto Rican kid,
the one that fights out of the bottoms.

186
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:11,352
If he's here in 20 minutes,
he gets 200 bucks.

187
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,062
Yo, I'll fight him.

188
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:14,772
Do me a favor, guy, go back to your bag.

189
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,107
We don't need anybody else getting hurt.
Take a walk.

190
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,610
Let's go. Watch his neck.

191
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:21,904
Yo, Rock, what did you do,

192
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,697
did you leave Mick and Paulie
at home today?

193
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:30,162
His phone's disconnected.

194
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,956
Then go through the list.
Find me somebody. Get me Joe Bones.

195
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,502
All I'm saying is
that if you need somebody to help you,

196
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:40,297
I'm happy to keep your boy warm for you.

197
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:52,893
You ever fought before?

198
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:53,977
Yeah.

199
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:58,816
Hey, this guy signed a waiver?

200
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:01,944
All good.

201
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,282
- What's your name?
- Tommy.

202
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,953
- You get tuned up in here, it's on you, Tom.
- Sure, no problem. No problem.

203
00:15:13,122 --> 00:15:14,498
Come on in.

204
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,466
Let's go. All right, let's go.

205
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,510
Hey. Watch that teeth.

206
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,722
Are you gonna be a hero? All right.

207
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,020
Come on. Check that kick.

208
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,480
Easy.

209
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,191
Come on, Dog, you can do it.
Let's go, come on.

210
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,028
- Good jab. Good jab!
- There we go!

211
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:54,371
No, he won't. Don't let him take your back.
Don't let him take your back!

212
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:55,456
- Dog, get up.
- Get up!

213
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,459
Cover up, cover up!

214
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,044
Don't give him your back.
Don't give him your back!

215
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:06,383
- Cover up!
- Come on, Dog!

216
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,344
Cover up, damn it!

217
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:28,947
You owe me 200 bucks.

218
00:16:46,632 --> 00:16:49,301
This one here.
See, this is the new appraisal figures

219
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,469
- that came in.
- Yeah.

220
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,721
And this is how it affects the monthly,
it turns into that.

221
00:16:52,805 --> 00:16:55,682
And the total value of the loan,
over the life of the loan, is that.

222
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,017
As you can see, that's just the way it is.

223
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,727
It puts you upside down,
that's the problem.

224
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:00,979
It's the county that did the assessment,
not the bank.

225
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,440
So, the numbers are what they are,
Mr. Conlon...

226
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,609
- Brendan.
- The numbers are what they are, Brendan.

227
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,694
I mean, you're a math teacher, right?
You can appreciate that.

228
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:10,489
I'm a physics teacher. I teach physics.

229
00:17:10,614 --> 00:17:14,117
Physics, okay. But the bank has got to go
by the new appraisal figures.

230
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,870
And, according to these figures,
you're upside down on your mortgage,

231
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:18,622
- you understand?
- God, you said that like three times.

232
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,666
I'm sorry, but I get that.

233
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:24,044
I am asking you,
is there something else you can do?

234
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:27,631
Not the bank, you.
Can you shift things around, restructure?

235
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,216
You refinanced twice already.

236
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,968
'Cause you advised us to do that.

237
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:33,428
- You told me.
- Well, I presented you with that option,

238
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:34,805
but that was your choice.

239
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:39,685
I'm also showing that you netted
a substantial payout with the refi.

240
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:42,104
We had that conversation.

241
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,524
I was paying medical bills.

242
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:49,570
Oh, right. Sorry. Your daughter's kidney?

243
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,489
- Heart.
- Heart. Right, sorry.

244
00:17:53,282 --> 00:17:54,950
A lot of stories.

245
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:59,079
All right, so, if that's my option,
I have no options.

246
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,415
You're not even gonna try and help me.
You're not even gonna try.

247
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,293
No, I'm trying. Look, Brendan,
I can get you 90 days to get even.

248
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,420
Ninety days is not enough.

249
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:10,173
My wife and I,
we have three jobs between us.

250
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,886
And that doesn't cut it.

251
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,513
So, what do you suggest?

252
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,183
Well, let me ask you a question?
Have you thought about bankruptcy?

253
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,352
It's a viable option.

254
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,355
There's no shame in this these days.

255
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,820
That's not how I do things.

256
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:37,034
Okay, well, then
you're looking at foreclosure.

257
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:49,880
<i>Utter domination by Tommy Conlon,
the undefeated freshman from Pittsburgh.</i>

258
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:53,508
<i>The prodigy has yet to yield a single point
in the entire tournament.</i>

259
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,802
<i>Tommy, trained by his father
since the age of five.</i>

260
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:58,722
<i>-Talking about Paddy Conlon?
- The controversial Paddy Conlon.</i>

261
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:01,433
<i>Say what you will about the methods
of the former Marine,</i>

262
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:04,227
<i>but he's led his son
to six straight Junior Olympic titles</i>

263
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:07,064
<i>and now just moments away
from a High School State Championship.</i>

264
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,316
<i>And there it is! Wow!</i>

265
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:12,319
<i>There's just no limit
to what the future holds forth is kid.</i>

266
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,988
<i>Tommy told me that he's chasing
the record of Theogenes,</i>

267
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:18,825
<i>apparently, a mythical Greek fighter
said to be undefeated in over 1,400 bouts.</i>

268
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,997
Hi, how're you doing, sir?
I'm looking for Tommy Riordan.

269
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:26,708
- Who?
- Tommy Riordan.

270
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,669
My name is Colt Boyd.

271
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:32,589
What business you got with Tommy?

272
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:35,801
Well, none yet, that's why I'm here.
I manage fighters.

273
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,806
So, Tommy's been working out at my gym,

274
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:46,770
and he put a beating on the number one
middleweight contender in the world today.

275
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:50,190
So, I want to know
a little bit more about the guy.

276
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:52,192
Maybe help him out.

277
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,736
I have a lot of contacts, Mr. Riordan.

278
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:57,322
Conlon. The name is Conlon.

279
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,034
And anything you wanna know
about Tommy,

280
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:02,828
you gotta ask him yourself.

281
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:04,955
Look, I'm just asking
for some general information here.

282
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,499
Like I said, anything you wanna know
about Tommy,

283
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,126
you gotta ask him yourself.

284
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:10,877
Look, I don't mean
to interrupt your night, okay?

285
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:13,296
He just put this address down
when he signed up at the gym.

286
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:15,298
He doesn't live here.

287
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:19,636
- All right, then.
- Okay. Good night.

288
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:31,773
All right, listen, kiddo.
I need you to put Mommy back on, okay?

289
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:33,984
I love you.

290
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:37,154
Hey. Hey, listen, I'm just pulling in,
I'm gonna have to go.

291
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:43,785
No, they got an open mic night thing on,
it's gonna be a quiet one.

292
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:47,330
All right, sleep well.

293
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,874
You, too. All right, bye.

294
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:57,007
<i>It's about time for your next contest.</i>

295
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:02,429
<i>Introducing first, in the red corner,
he fights out of Ripley, West Virginia.</i>

296
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:07,309
<i>Please welcome Mike "The Mutilator" Moore.</i>

297
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:08,477
Say, "Uncle!"

298
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:10,061
Go, Mike. Go!

299
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:19,237
<i>And his opponent in the blue corner,
he fights out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</i>

300
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:23,700
<i>Please welcome "Irish" Brendan Conlon.</i>

301
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:31,291
<i>This bout is scheduled
for three, five-minute rounds,</i>

302
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:35,253
<i>and when the action begins,
your referee is Mr. Rick Fike.</i>

303
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:37,881
<i>Fighters to the center.</i>

304
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,635
<i>Come on, gentlemen.</i>

305
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:43,803
<i>I want you to obey my commands
at all times.</i>

306
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,014
<i>I want you to protect yourselves at all times.</i>

307
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,433
<i>If you have no questions,
touch gloves, back up.</i>

308
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:51,019
<i>And on my signal, let's come out fighting.</i>

309
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:58,985
Fighter, are you ready?

310
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:00,403
Are you ready?

311
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,655
Do it!

312
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:13,083
Come on, Mike, let's go!

313
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:25,720
You gotta move with that one.

314
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:43,947
Come on, Mike!

315
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,459
Don't let him do that to you, Mike!

316
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:02,173
Get up, Mike, get up!

317
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,943
- First five minutes, out.
- Another 15? Great.

318
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,989
Hey! Hey, kid!

319
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:29,659
Nice fight.
Two more wins, you take home the bacon.

320
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,036
Hey, good job...

321
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:46,926
Hey, babe.

322
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:48,261
Hey.

323
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:19,209
How was work?

324
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,298
Oh, my God!

325
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,053
What happened?

326
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:33,181
You said it was gonna be a slow night.

327
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:38,103
I'm not bouncing at a club.

328
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:43,233
What do you mean you're not bouncing?

329
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,420
You've been lying to me?

330
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:09,259
I went in to apply

331
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:15,598
and they were paying nine bucks an hour.

332
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:24,023
Then I saw a sign for this other thing.

333
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,032
They're putting us out of the house
in three months.

334
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,200
We're running out of options.

335
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:35,952
Then they put us out of the house
in three months.

336
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:37,787
I'd rather go back to the old apartment

337
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:40,957
than see you in the back
of an ambulance again.

338
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:44,127
I thought we agreed
that we weren't gonna raise our children

339
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:47,797
in a family where their father
gets beat up for a living.

340
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,304
We're not giving up the house.

341
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,222
It's our home.

342
00:25:57,474 --> 00:25:59,184
We're not going backwards.

343
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,032
We'll figure it out.

344
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:19,120
This is what we're not going back to.

345
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:49,120
<b>Subtitle 
 www.movieddl.me</b>

346
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:18,888
You wanted to talk?

347
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:21,766
Yeah.

348
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,312
I'm gonna start fighting.

349
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,189
Is that right?

350
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:29,315
Don't play babe in the woods with me.

351
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,734
I know that guy from the gym
came to see you.

352
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:33,319
Colt Boyd.

353
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:36,531
Yeah. I didn't tell him anything, Tommy.

354
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:40,034
I wouldn't be sitting here
with you now if you did.

355
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:42,412
- Paddy, can I get you more coffee?
- No. Thank you. I'm fine.

356
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:45,498
- Hon, would you like a cup of coffee? Okay.
- Sure. Thank you.

357
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:49,627
All right.

358
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:51,796
There's this tournament,

359
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:53,464
it's a big tournament.

360
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:57,844
Top 16 middleweights in the world.
Single elimination.

361
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:00,722
Winner takes all. It's a lot of money.

362
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:04,183
- Okay.
- I'm gonna do that.

363
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:08,146
But if I'm doing it,

364
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:14,277
then I'm gonna need a trainer.

365
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:17,113
Now, that much, you were good at.

366
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:20,658
What?

367
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:23,786
No, no, no.
This doesn't mean anything, okay?

368
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,955
I'm serious.

369
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:28,082
We train. That's it.

370
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:30,710
I don't want to hear a word
about anything but training.

371
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:32,337
You understand?

372
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:36,341
You want to tell your war stories,
you can take them down to the VFW.

373
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:39,802
Or you can take it to a meeting, or to church,

374
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,305
or whatever the hell it is
that you do nowadays.

375
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,098
What about Colt Boyd?

376
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:46,684
What about him? I told him
I don't train with people that I don't know.

377
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:49,187
- The devil you know.
- Excuse me?

378
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:53,316
The devil you know
is better than the devil you don't.

379
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,987
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

380
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:00,281
There's your coffee, hon.

381
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,200
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

382
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:06,829
Chasing Theogenes.
It'll be kind of like the old times.

383
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,583
I just told you, this doesn't mean anything.

384
00:29:11,626 --> 00:29:14,462
Now, get that through your skull right now
or I'm walking.

385
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:16,381
All right. All right.

386
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:19,092
But you get something
through your skull, too.

387
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:23,346
You called me, so don't go
threatening to walk every five minutes.

388
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:27,517
And since this is about training,

389
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:31,479
you dump whatever it is you need to dump
as far as those pills are concerned.

390
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:33,481
I don't wanna see them.

391
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:36,693
In fact, hand them over right now.

392
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:40,613
I know they're on you, Tommy.

393
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:44,450
You sounded like a goddamn maraca
coming through the door.

394
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:58,131
That's not gonna do.

395
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:03,886
When you came through that door, it was...

396
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:07,849
Three.

397
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:15,940
That'a boy.

398
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,319
And another thing.
You don't eat crap like this.

399
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:22,572
This is for losers and old men.

400
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:26,325
And we're gonna have to bunk up.

401
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:28,661
If we're gonna do this right,
you're gonna stay at the house.

402
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:32,415
I watch your diet.
We follow the old regimen.

403
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,293
You copy?

404
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,921
All right.

405
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:41,758
Copy.

406
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:57,106
Your brother's a liar.

407
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,691
- ...went in the middle of the night...
- Yeah.

408
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:01,277
...and he went to a strip club,
and he said he saw Mr. C...

409
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,570
- No way.
- Front and center.

410
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,947
- Like MMA type stuff.
- You weren't there, so you don't know.

411
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:06,032
What's MMA?

412
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:07,075
- Mixed martial arts.
- Like, fighting.

413
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:08,534
Like, different styles of fighting.

414
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:10,953
He was just, like,
dropped him on the floor...

415
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:17,335
It's true?

416
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:19,337
Take your seats.

417
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,755
Now, please.

418
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:34,018
Hey, yo, Mr. C.

419
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,521
Hey, my brother was at the titty bar
last night,

420
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:40,149
and he said you was choking brothers out.
I mean, what's up, is it true?

421
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,318
Yeah, Mr. C. I mean, like, is it true?

422
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,237
Did you really work on some fools
or something?

423
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,239
- You have to tell us.
- Yeah.

424
00:31:57,208 --> 00:32:00,586
All right.
I want examples of forms of energy.

425
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:22,775
Come on. It's not as bad as it looks.

426
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:27,947
Are you being literal or figurative?
Because, literally, it looks bad.

427
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:31,492
And figuratively, it looks even worse.

428
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:33,786
The superintendent's coming by.
Few minutes.

429
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:37,748
Oh, man.

430
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:41,043
So, come on, Brendan.
Give me a little help here.

431
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:45,548
I mean, could you explain to me
what the hell you were doing?

432
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:51,888
I need the money, Joe.

433
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,640
Yeah, but this is...

434
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:56,434
We can't have this.

435
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:59,854
This isn't moonlighting at Applebee's,
for Christ's sake.

436
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,815
Shit, Brendan.

437
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:05,818
Leaving everything else aside,
which we can't,

438
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:07,737
are you out of your mind?

439
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:09,989
You're gonna get yourself killed.

440
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:11,657
I mean, you're a goddamn teacher.

441
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:14,243
You got no business in the ring
with those animals.

442
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:18,831
Actually, I used to be one of those animals.

443
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:23,878
I fought for a living.

444
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:28,466
Guess I forgot to put that down
on my application.

445
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:32,261
Yeah, I guess you did.

446
00:33:32,887 --> 00:33:34,722
Look, I'm sorry, Joe. It's just...

447
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:37,642
Look, look,
the school district is not gonna tolerate

448
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:39,810
teachers cockfighting in strip clubs.

449
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:42,521
It was a parking lot of a strip club.

450
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:44,982
Wherever it was, you can't be doing it.

451
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:49,987
All right? I mean, this is a serious...
Shit, he's here.

452
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:52,448
This is a serious problem.

453
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:59,997
Guy hasn't been inside a school since 9/11.

454
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:04,627
What are we gonna do?

455
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,714
You say, "Yes, sir," and you say, "No, sir,"

456
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:11,759
and you say,
"It will never happen again, sir."

457
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:16,180
And then we just pray to God
that he's in a good mood.

458
00:34:22,478 --> 00:34:23,521
UFC?

459
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:27,316
Yeah.

460
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:30,027
Son of a bitch.

461
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,657
- Superintendent Yorn. Good to see you, sir.
- Principal Zito.

462
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:54,760
What are you doing?

463
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:58,723
Well,

464
00:34:58,806 --> 00:35:02,184
the girls have an important piano recital
in the morning.

465
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:06,063
And we have an equipment malfunction.

466
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:11,819
How'd it go?

467
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:16,782
They're gonna review your case
at the end of the semester.

468
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:21,370
But until then,
you're suspended without pay.

469
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,713
Joe gave me the number of his attorney.

470
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:34,425
How the hell are we gonna pay
for an attorney?

471
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:37,678
He talked to me for free as a favor to Joe.

472
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:39,972
That's nice.

473
00:35:40,056 --> 00:35:41,724
He said there's no precedent for this.

474
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:44,977
You'll be back by next semester.

475
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:47,063
The next semester?

476
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:58,824
Tess,

477
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:03,079
they have these smoker fights all over.

478
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:09,043
There's one in Lancaster next week,
there's two in Dover the week after.

479
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:12,254
Wilmington, Camden, Baltimore.

480
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:19,095
That could keep us afloat.

481
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,392
You're gonna put yourself through this
over and over for 500 bucks a pop?

482
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,647
Some of them pay a lot more than that.

483
00:36:32,441 --> 00:36:36,529
I would have to bounce for a month
to make what I made in two hours last night.

484
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:39,448
Yeah.

485
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:44,578
And these guys, they're not real fighters.

486
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:49,208
They're just guys that have seen
too much UFC on TV.

487
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:58,759
Now, if you have a better solution,

488
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:01,137
I'm all ears, but...

489
00:37:04,098 --> 00:37:06,600
And what are we gonna tell the girls?

490
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:09,728
It'll be fine.

491
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:12,398
I'll just leave the house as usual,

492
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:15,526
except, only this time,
I'll be going to the gym.

493
00:37:28,164 --> 00:37:31,167
<i>The duck goes
quack, quack, quack, quack</i>

494
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:36,046
<i>And the cow goes
moo, moo, moo!</i>

495
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:41,302
<i>But that rooster
That rooster, he knew everything</i>

496
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,554
<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</i>

497
00:37:43,637 --> 00:37:46,932
<i>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</i>

498
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:49,810
Let's go, kiddo. Let's get moving.

499
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:53,355
Look what I found

500
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:56,066
in that disaster of a...

501
00:37:58,027 --> 00:37:59,445
...basement.

502
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:03,908
What do you say we sit down

503
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,119
and update this?

504
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:12,666
And you can fill me in
on how close you got to that record.

505
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:20,508
Did you continue wrestling
after you left with your mother?

506
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,306
Come on, Tommy. Tell me something.

507
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,393
Yeah, I'll tell you something.

508
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:36,106
You can take that back
to where you found it,

509
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,651
you can leave the coffee in the pot.

510
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:41,529
I can pour that myself.

511
00:38:41,612 --> 00:38:44,073
And I can wake myself up, too.

512
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:58,128
Hurt my knees
coming up and down those stairs.

513
00:38:58,212 --> 00:38:59,672
Yeah?

514
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:04,301
I'll leave the coffee pot on until 0500,
then I dump it.

515
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,395
I give command dismiss.
You'll wash your nasty bodies.

516
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:18,190
You can square your gear away.

517
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:20,985
Corporal Bradford, take this to CSC,
let them know we're back.

518
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:22,486
Roger, sir.

519
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,698
Detail, a-ten-hut!

520
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,659
7-3-4, this is Gealer Base.
Sitrep, over.

521
00:39:30,661 --> 00:39:32,871
What's up, Mark?

522
00:39:32,955 --> 00:39:35,541
Here, sir. William's Company's back in.

523
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:37,668
Damn, dude! That's brutal.

524
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:39,420
- Did you see that? Oh, my God.
- What?

525
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:40,588
What's that?

526
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:44,383
Dude, Mad Dog Grimes is getting tuned up
by some dude at a gym in Pittsburgh.

527
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:45,926
Who is Mad Dog Grimes?

528
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,470
Shit, Bradford,
the stuff you don't know amazes me.

529
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:51,307
- Dude. Oh, my God, did you see that?
- Wow. Oh, my God.

530
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,767
- Wait. Rewind that.
- Okay.

531
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,772
Right there, pause, pause, pause.

532
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:03,360
What's up, man?

533
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:07,573
Dude, what's his deal?

534
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:14,496
You're not gonna get your 11.

535
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:17,666
- AV, I need to see the tape.
- What tape?

536
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,668
- What tape?
- The tape!

537
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:25,007
Hoolihan, fill in for me?

538
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:26,425
Get the camera.

539
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:03,629
That's him.

540
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,883
That's him.

541
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:12,763
Let the music sink into you.
This is Beethoven.

542
00:41:12,846 --> 00:41:16,350
I want you to breathe. I don't want
you boxing like this. No more stiff, right?

543
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:19,436
You listen to the music.
You relax, you breathe. One, two...

544
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:27,152
Again. One, two. One, two. One, two.

545
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:33,409
Good.

546
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:35,911
Good, good, good. Yos.

547
00:41:37,413 --> 00:41:40,666
You're gonna get it, you're gonna get it.
All right? Two more rounds.

548
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:48,048
Do I know you?

549
00:41:50,718 --> 00:41:51,760
- Oh, man!
- Wow.

550
00:41:51,844 --> 00:41:54,680
- Long time, brother. Too long.
- How you doing?

551
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:56,056
- Too long.
- Look at your place.

552
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,141
- You like?
- Yeah.

553
00:41:57,725 --> 00:42:01,061
You see this beast? Marco Santos.

554
00:42:01,145 --> 00:42:03,021
- He's training for Sparta.
- Yeah, right.

555
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:04,481
Not bad, right?

556
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:06,275
It's amazing, man.

557
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:10,154
Only the best. Move! Move! Move!
Move or die!

558
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,949
- You look good, brother.
- Thanks.

559
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,372
How are the girls?

560
00:42:20,456 --> 00:42:23,292
Good. Yeah. I had another little one, Rosie.

561
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:27,379
I know. I know because Johnny C. told me
that she was in the hospital for a bit.

562
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:28,756
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

563
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:31,925
You know,

564
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:36,889
I was gonna call you
and then time went by and...

565
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:38,807
I'm a piece of shit. I should've called you.
I'm sorry.

566
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:39,892
- No. Come on.
- No.

567
00:42:40,309 --> 00:42:43,562
Brendan, I'm sorry.

568
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:46,523
It's all good. She's good now.

569
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:48,567
- She's okay?
- So beautiful.

570
00:42:52,446 --> 00:42:57,409
It's good to see you, man.
So everything's going great, huh?

571
00:42:57,493 --> 00:42:58,911
Yeah.

572
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:03,373
Well, I've got a little problem.

573
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:08,420
The guys at the bank
want to take my house away.

574
00:43:08,504 --> 00:43:10,255
- What?
- Yeah.

575
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:13,842
That's kind of why
I came to see you, actually.

576
00:43:18,222 --> 00:43:21,683
You know, I got most of my dough
tied up in this joint,

577
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:22,935
but how much do you need?

578
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,853
I didn't come here for a loan, Frank.

579
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:27,689
I mean, I was hoping that

580
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:32,152
you would train me.

581
00:43:32,945 --> 00:43:33,946
Train you for what?

582
00:43:34,488 --> 00:43:36,365
I wanna get back in the cage.

583
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:38,700
Are you serious?

584
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:43,455
Come on, Brendan.

585
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:45,374
I won an event the other night.

586
00:43:46,083 --> 00:43:49,503
You won an event. That's what this is.

587
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:53,257
Let me guess. It was in a parking lot?
DJ from a local radio station,

588
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,844
a couple of ring card girls
you wouldn't bang on a dare? Am I right?

589
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,430
- Ish.
- Ish.

590
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,892
Brendan. I love you.

591
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:06,395
Why am I gonna train you?

592
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:10,065
When you were on the right side of 30,
you were barely a .500 fighter.

593
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:13,151
You never listened to me.

594
00:44:13,235 --> 00:44:16,613
You don't listen to anyone.
These guys are animals.

595
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:21,785
You're a teacher, right?
What are you gonna do?

596
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:25,414
You're gonna come down here
a couple of days a week after detention?

597
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:29,084
You're gonna skip out
of the girls' volleyball game early?

598
00:44:29,543 --> 00:44:32,087
I've got loads of time. Time's not an issue.

599
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:36,341
Parking lot thing kind of got me suspended.

600
00:44:43,307 --> 00:44:45,893
I need to keep working the smokers.

601
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,356
Tess know about this?

602
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,858
Yeah?

603
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:55,152
'Cause the last time you fought,
I got read the riot act,

604
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:58,113
sitting in a hospital waiting room.
You remember that?

605
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,324
I was unconscious.

606
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:04,328
- You were more than unconscious.
- I was.

607
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:08,749
She's not gonna come down here
with the two puppies, screaming at Frank?

608
00:45:08,832 --> 00:45:12,502
It's not gonna happen.

609
00:45:12,586 --> 00:45:13,629
What do you say, Frank?

610
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:17,507
What do I say?
What am I gonna say to you? "No"?

611
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:20,677
I mean, all my time
is wrapped up with Marco.

612
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:23,805
You know, you come down, I throw you
in a rotation, you spar with these guys.

613
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:28,477
But I can't promise you
much more than that, Brendan.

614
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,937
That's all I need.

615
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,272
Great. All right.

616
00:45:32,356 --> 00:45:33,815
Yeah.

617
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:35,943
- I appreciate it.
- What, are you kidding me?

618
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:38,320
- You need anything, you call me.
- I will.

619
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:39,738
Let me know when you're coming down.

620
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:42,366
Well, I'm just gonna get
my stuff from the car.

621
00:45:43,784 --> 00:45:44,785
Now?

622
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:12,938
Hey, Brendan.

623
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:16,316
Brendan, it's me, Pop.

624
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:23,156
What are you doing here?

625
00:46:23,532 --> 00:46:25,367
I have some news for you.

626
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:31,289
Something wrong with your hands?

627
00:46:31,373 --> 00:46:32,708
- No.
- If there's nothing wrong with your hands,

628
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:34,167
there's no reason for you not to phone.

629
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:36,795
- That's the deal.
- Yeah. I forgot.

630
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,922
The phone or mail, Pop. Non negotiable.

631
00:46:39,006 --> 00:46:43,051
Hey, Brendan.
You ever seen my hands so steady?

632
00:46:43,135 --> 00:46:44,720
Ever seen that?

633
00:46:46,888 --> 00:46:48,473
I'm going inside.

634
00:46:48,557 --> 00:46:50,892
I got 1,000 days, Brendan.

635
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:53,395
Thousand days sober, today.

636
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,149
Well, that's great, Pop,
but it doesn't change anything.

637
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:58,358
What do you mean,
doesn't change anything?

638
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,527
Have a heart, Brendan.

639
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:02,988
You listen to me.

640
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:06,116
You take your "have a heart" bullshit
and you run it down the road.

641
00:47:07,117 --> 00:47:09,286
Yeah, run it out with someone
that doesn't know you like I do.

642
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:13,707
All right, listen to me.
I thought maybe we could break bread.

643
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:17,002
You know,
just open some lines of communication.

644
00:47:17,419 --> 00:47:22,340
You got two lines of communication.
You got the telephone and the post office.

645
00:47:22,424 --> 00:47:23,842
God! Just 'cause you decide
it's a special day,

646
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:25,093
it doesn't make it one for me.

647
00:47:25,177 --> 00:47:27,179
I've got a wife and kids inside,
and they're waiting for me,

648
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:28,930
so I don't have time for whatever this is.

649
00:47:29,014 --> 00:47:32,809
I know you got a wife and kid in there.
I've got a granddaughter in there

650
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:34,686
I haven't seen in three years.

651
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:36,521
And another one I haven't even ever met.

652
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:39,608
Yeah. Why is that, Pop?

653
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:41,610
Why is that?

654
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:45,739
Do you remember
having anything to do with that?

655
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:47,741
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

656
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:51,119
That shit you pulled.

657
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:54,539
Never again.

658
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:57,084
And all that shit I saw growing up,

659
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:00,712
- that doesn't happen here.
- Look...

660
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:04,132
Take care of yourself.

661
00:48:06,802 --> 00:48:08,428
Tommy's back.

662
00:48:14,893 --> 00:48:16,728
He's in the 'Burgh.

663
00:48:21,108 --> 00:48:22,400
You say Tommy's in Pittsburgh?

664
00:48:22,484 --> 00:48:24,778
Yeah, he came to see me.

665
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:28,240
He came to see you?

666
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:31,993
Yeah. He's over at the house.

667
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:37,040
We're doing a little training at Fitzy's.

668
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:38,834
You remember Fitzy's?

669
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:40,794
It ain't Fitzy's anymore.

670
00:48:43,463 --> 00:48:44,840
You and Tommy are training together?

671
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:46,591
Yeah.

672
00:48:47,259 --> 00:48:49,594
- Tommy Conlon?
- Riordan.

673
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:52,681
- He's using your mother's maiden name.
- Yeah, I know what her name is.

674
00:48:52,764 --> 00:48:57,477
Well, I thought you'd wanna know he's back.
So that's why I drove all the way over here.

675
00:48:58,019 --> 00:48:59,604
I thought you came to break bread
over 1,000 days.

676
00:48:59,688 --> 00:49:02,941
No, I did, Brendan, that's most important.

677
00:49:03,024 --> 00:49:04,818
That, too.

678
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:09,364
All right. Did he say if he wants to see me?

679
00:49:11,283 --> 00:49:12,784
He doesn't say much, Brendan.

680
00:49:18,874 --> 00:49:21,877
He's just not that happy kid he was,
you know?

681
00:49:23,545 --> 00:49:25,130

- What?

682
00:49:25,213 --> 00:49:26,381
Mr. Inside Man.

683
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:28,300
Inside? What?

684
00:49:28,842 --> 00:49:32,429
You and Tommy training together like
nothing ever happened. It's unbelievable.

685
00:49:32,512 --> 00:49:34,222

- Now I know what you're really doing here.

686
00:49:34,306 --> 00:49:35,724
- What's that?
- You came to gloat.

687
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:38,560
I did not come to gloat.
I came to get my son back.

688
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:40,812
Wow. There you go.
Yeah, you got your son back.

Forget it.

692
00:49:54,743 --> 00:50:00,749
Yeah, I'll tell you. Part of the reason...
Part of the reason I stuck around,

693
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:02,918
'cause I thought I'd finally get you
all to myself.

694
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:08,882
But you didn't have any interest
in training me.

695
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:12,385
- You thought Tommy was the one.
- Brendan, I was a drunk.

696
00:50:12,469 --> 00:50:15,513
I mean, you know, Brendan, I'm sorry.

697
00:50:15,597 --> 00:50:16,598
Forget it.

698
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:22,229
You were always a frontrunner.
Never had any interest in the underdogs.

699
00:50:24,773 --> 00:50:27,609
- But I was your son.
- You are my son, Brendan.

700
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,861
- Am I?
- Yeah, you are.

701
00:50:31,321 --> 00:50:34,866
I'm just asking you if you can find...

702
00:50:36,785 --> 00:50:42,040
Find a little bit of space in your heart
to forgive me a little bit.

703
00:50:44,626 --> 00:50:48,380
Yeah? All right, I forgive you.

704
00:50:49,631 --> 00:50:52,425
- Okay.
- But I do not trust you.

705

Listen, tell Tommy, if he wants to see me,
this is where I am.

706
00:50:58,932 --> 00:51:01,476
- Okay. But they're not different things.
- All right?

707
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,478
You gotta trust to forgive.

- Daddy, who is that?

00:59:01,664 --> 00:59:04,834
and it's too bad about Marco.

843
00:59:07,795 --> 00:59:09,255
But how about me?

844
00:59:10,882 --> 00:59:11,883
Are you talking about Sparta?

845
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:14,552
Yeah.

846
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:16,220
Brendan, you've got a better shot
at starting a boy band.

847
00:59:16,304 --> 00:59:17,305
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

848
00:59:27,523 --> 00:59:29,192
It's a Grand Prix tournament.

849
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:34,030
Which means anything could happen.
You know that as well as I do.

850
00:59:34,113 --> 00:59:35,615
Yeah.

851
00:59:37,492 --> 00:59:39,452
Come on. They'd have to kill me
to get me out of the cage.

852
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:42,371
That's what I'm afraid of.

853
00:59:42,455 --> 00:59:43,956
Frank, I need this.

854
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:48,002
You're real tight with these guys.
You could call them.

855
00:59:49,003 --> 00:59:51,923
You're the guy. They trust you.

856
00:59:55,176 --> 00:59:57,929
Brendan.

857
00:59:58,012 --> 00:59:59,972
You realize
what you're asking me to do here?

858
01:00:00,056 --> 01:00:01,557
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

859
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:04,769
We go down to AC,
you get tapped out in five seconds.

860
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:06,646
How does that benefit either one of us?

861
01:00:06,729 --> 01:00:09,941
- It's not gonna happen.
- Not gonna happen?

862
01:00:10,024 --> 01:00:11,984
Wish I had a nickel
for every time somebody told me that.

863
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,278
It's not gonna happen.

864
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,212
I'll make a call.

865
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:41,347
I love my coach!

866
01:00:50,189 --> 01:00:53,192
Yeah, they're good. The girls are good.
They're good.

867
01:00:54,277 --> 01:00:55,361
Yeah, he should.

868
01:00:55,444 --> 01:00:57,989
I mean, you've been spending
so much time with Brendan these days,

869
01:00:58,072 --> 01:01:01,117
it's like you're part of the family
or something.

870
01:01:03,286 --> 01:01:06,831
Yeah, he's right here. It's your boyfriend.

871
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:10,501
Frank. Hey, man.

872
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:19,844
That's unbelievable.

873
01:01:21,012 --> 01:01:24,932
Wow! Wow, Frank, I can't thank you enough.
I don't know what to say.

874
01:01:26,726 --> 01:01:29,687
All right, listen, I gotta call you back, okay?

875
01:01:35,276 --> 01:01:37,570
All right. Bye.

876
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:40,448
I'm in.

877
01:01:41,574 --> 01:01:43,826
- I'm going.
- Really?

878
01:01:44,952 --> 01:01:48,456
That's your decision? You decided?

879
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:52,710
'Cause I really enjoyed the conversation
we just had

880
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:55,796
about making that decision together.

881
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:04,263
You told me you were gonna fight guys
that watched too much UFC.

882
01:02:04,347 --> 01:02:06,557
I saw the Koba dude on the television,

883
01:02:06,641 --> 01:02:08,559
and he's the guy they're watching.

884
01:02:08,643 --> 01:02:09,602
It's a lot of money, Tess.

885
01:02:09,685 --> 01:02:12,188
I don't give a shit about the money,
Brendan. I told you that.

886
01:02:13,439 --> 01:02:15,441
We're gonna end up
cashing in your life insurance policy

887
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:16,984
before we pick up that prize money.

888
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:19,904
You don't think I can do it, right?

889
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:21,989
I think you could get killed.

890
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:28,079
- I'm not gonna get killed.
- You're not gonna get killed,

891
01:02:28,162 --> 01:02:29,580
but you promised me
you're not gonna get hurt.

892
01:02:29,664 --> 01:02:32,249
You're not gonna end up in the hospital.
You're not gonna end up paralyzed.

893
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:34,877
We have no prize money, we have no house.

894
01:02:34,961 --> 01:02:38,005
- We have payments for hospital bills.
- Tess! Listen, I'll promise you this.

895
01:02:39,507 --> 01:02:42,593
If I don't try in three weeks,
they're gonna take the house.

896
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:46,222
How's that for a promise?

897
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:53,104
So, I'm gonna go, okay?

898
01:02:53,187 --> 01:02:56,440
But I'd really love it
if you'd be with me on this.

899
01:03:03,489 --> 01:03:05,950
I'm not gonna watch you fight again,
I'm not.

900
01:03:06,033 --> 01:03:08,452
I'm gonna get the girls breakfast.

901
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:41,819

907
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:59,170
J.J., you've made a fortune
with your hedge funds.

908
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,963
<i>You turned your back on Wall Street</i>

909
01:04:01,047 --> 01:04:03,382

<i>Tell us why this tournament
is so important to you?</i>

911
01:04:06,886 --> 01:04:07,928
Growing up, we all wanted to know

912
01:04:08,012 --> 01:04:10,222
who the toughest kid
in the neighborhood was, right?

913
01:04:10,306 --> 01:04:12,141
I wanna know
who the toughest man on the planet is.

914
01:04:12,224 --> 01:04:13,934
<i>And that's why I put this thing together.</i>

915

- Thank you, J.J.</i>

No, yeah, I've seen your stuff. It looks good.

926
01:04:55,601 --> 01:04:57,061
I mean, is he fighting after Sparta?

927
01:04:57,144 --> 01:04:59,230
I mean, we're trying to find
some info on him.

928
01:04:59,313 --> 01:05:00,815
No, I'm not sure.

Hey, where'd you go? Where'd you go?

930
01:05:34,974 --> 01:05:37,685
You can't leave me like that.
They want to talk to you, not me.

931

- Frank Campana?
- Yeah.

932

Hi. Julia, J.J. Riley's assistant.

- Brendan Conlon?

937

- Press conference will start in 20 minutes.
- Okay.

938
01:05:50,156 --> 01:05:52,324
Brendan, you're gonna be sitting up
on the stage.

01:05:56,162 --> 01:05:57,913

Been looking all over for you.

How's it going?

985
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,210
It's going.

986
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:55,466
I was thinking we should go grab a coffee.

987
01:08:57,009 --> 01:08:59,887
I don't drink coffee, man.
What do you want?

988
01:09:02,306 --> 01:09:03,432
You don't wanna go sit down somewhere?

989
01:09:06,894 --> 01:09:08,145
I'm good right here.

990
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:11,357
Okay.

991
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:20,908
Shit, Tommy, how was I supposed to know
I was never gonna see you guys again?

992
01:09:20,991 --> 01:09:22,368
Yeah, well, you were briefed.

993
01:09:24,244 --> 01:09:25,704
You had the information.

994
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:30,918
You chose the old man and the girl.

995
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:33,045
She wasn't just some girl.

996
01:09:35,631 --> 01:09:37,424
I married her.

997
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:42,262
She's my wife.

998
01:09:42,346 --> 01:09:44,515
See?

999
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:47,017
That's Tess.

1000
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:49,478
That's Emily and Rosie.

1001
01:09:49,561 --> 01:09:51,688
They're your nieces, Tommy.

1002
01:09:51,772 --> 01:09:53,399
I don't know them.

1003
01:09:53,482 --> 01:09:57,319
I know you don't know them.
Of course you don't know them.

1004
01:09:57,611 --> 01:10:00,948
So why am I looking at pictures
of people I don't know?

1005
01:10:02,074 --> 01:10:04,034
'Cause that's my family.

1006
01:10:06,286 --> 01:10:08,038
And who are you exactly?

1007
01:10:13,127 --> 01:10:14,461
I'm your brother, man.

1008
01:10:17,798 --> 01:10:19,174
You were in the Corps?

1009
01:10:19,633 --> 01:10:21,135
What?

1010
01:10:21,218 --> 01:10:24,471
- I said I didn't know you were in the Corps.
- I wasn't in the Corps.

1011
01:10:25,681 --> 01:10:27,891
Then you ain't no brother to me.

1012
01:10:29,143 --> 01:10:30,477
My brother was in the Corps.

1013
01:10:31,145 --> 01:10:32,729
Jesus, Tommy. Tommy.

1014
01:10:32,855 --> 01:10:36,275
I was a 16-year-old kid.
What the hell did I know?

1015
01:10:36,692 --> 01:10:37,776
I don't know what you know.

1016
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:39,486
Why don't you go ask your girlfriend
about it?

1017
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:41,155
She's my wife, Tommy.

1018
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,533
So, that's it? I stay with Tess,
I never get to see you guys again?

1019
01:10:44,616 --> 01:10:46,994
Not a single phone call? Nothing?

1020
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:50,998
God, man, I don't understand this.

1021
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:53,167
What? You...

1022
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:56,920
So, you won't forgive me,
but you forgave Pop?

1023
01:10:59,006 --> 01:11:03,260
No, he's just some old vet that I train with,
you know? He means nothing to me.

1024
01:11:04,845 --> 01:11:07,681
And what I hear,
he means nothing to you, either.

1025
01:11:09,183 --> 01:11:12,394
You got balls talking about forgiveness.

1026
01:11:12,478 --> 01:11:14,229
That has nothing to do with forgiveness.

1027
01:11:14,313 --> 01:11:17,107
I got children, man. I got a family to protect.

1028
01:11:17,191 --> 01:11:19,193
Everything I do is for them.

1029
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:21,737
I forgave Pop.

1030
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:23,655
Just like I forgave you and Mom.

1031
01:11:31,038 --> 01:11:32,539
You forgave us?

1032
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:35,751
Yeah.

1033
01:11:36,752 --> 01:11:38,837
Well, I'm not surprised
you made the tournament, Brendan.

1034
01:11:38,921 --> 01:11:41,006
You got some stones, man.

1035
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:43,675
I fell in love.
What the hell was I supposed to do?

1036
01:11:43,759 --> 01:11:46,470
You were supposed to stick to the plan.
You were supposed to come with us.

1037
01:11:46,553 --> 01:11:50,057
Mom needed you, I needed you.
You're my big brother. You bailed on me.

1038
01:11:51,892 --> 01:11:53,977
Hey, you know, I'm glad you stayed.
Everything worked out for you.

1039
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:55,103
God.

1040
01:11:55,187 --> 01:11:58,815
You leave, you get the opposite. Okay?

1041
01:11:58,899 --> 01:12:01,568
You leave, you get to bury people.

1042
01:12:01,652 --> 01:12:04,571
You're not the only one
that suffered, Tommy.

1043
01:12:06,448 --> 01:12:08,784
I didn't even know she was sick.

1044
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:13,914
I never even got the chance to say goodbye
to my own mother.

1045
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:20,462
You had no right to keep that from me.
That was not your decision to make!

1046
01:12:22,631 --> 01:12:24,925
You know what?

1047
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:28,428
You walk around
with your pictures of your wife,

1048
01:12:28,512 --> 01:12:30,806
and you're all, "I forgive you.

1049
01:12:31,932 --> 01:12:33,433
"I forgive Pop.

1050
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:35,686
"I forgive everyone."

1051
01:12:35,769 --> 01:12:37,271
Brendan, you know,

1052
01:12:38,981 --> 01:12:40,774
you're full of shit.

1053
01:12:46,947 --> 01:12:49,575
Are we done, Brendan? Are we finished?

1054
01:13:09,636 --> 01:13:12,097
You realize you're supposed to seek
my wise counsel

1055
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:14,308
while school's actually in session, right?

1056
01:13:14,391 --> 01:13:16,310
- Yes, Principal Z.
- Tell him.

1057
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:18,687
Okay, we wanna use the auditorium
this weekend

1058
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:20,731
to watch Mr. C in Sparta.

1059
01:13:20,814 --> 01:13:22,482
What do you say?

1060
01:13:22,566 --> 01:13:24,234
So, you want to use the auditorium

1061
01:13:24,318 --> 01:13:27,946
to watch a suspended teacher engage
in the activity that he was suspended for?

1062
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:29,281
- Right.
- Am I hearing this correct?

1063
01:13:29,364 --> 01:13:31,241
Right. Okay, we thought you would say that,

1064
01:13:31,325 --> 01:13:33,160
so it could turn into a fundraiser,
you know?

1065
01:13:33,243 --> 01:13:35,287
You know,
I think you need to talk to your parents,

1066
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:37,497
because you guys might need
to be in summer school.

1067
01:13:37,581 --> 01:13:38,999
- Everybody wants this.
- Come on, Mr. Zito.

1068
01:13:39,082 --> 01:13:40,584
We've been telling everybody
about it already.

1069
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:41,668
- Exactly.
- And the gym's the only place

1070
01:13:41,752 --> 01:13:44,046
- that's big enough to fit everyone.
- Look, it's never gonna happen.

1071
01:13:44,129 --> 01:13:46,632
- What if we get a petition signed?
- We'll get the whole school to sign it.

1072
01:13:46,715 --> 01:13:48,592
- The power of democracy.
- What are they gonna do about that?

1073
01:13:48,675 --> 01:13:49,635
Mr. Z, please?

1074
01:13:49,718 --> 01:13:52,763
Look, look, you guys. I appreciate the fact
that you love your teacher, I really do,

1075
01:13:52,846 --> 01:13:55,891
but there is nothing I can do for you.

1076
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:33,512
<i>The roof is about to blow clean off
Boardwalk Hall Arena.</i>

1077
01:14:33,595 --> 01:14:38,517
<i>It might be Fourth of July weekend,
but this is Christmas Eve for fight fans.</i>

1078
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:42,813
<i>This is Atlantic City.
This is the War on the Shore,</i>

1079
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:45,816
<i>and this is
what everyone's been waiting for.</i>

1080
01:14:45,899 --> 01:14:50,737
<i>Sixteen of the baddest men on the planet
duking it out over a 24-hour period</i>

1081
01:14:50,821 --> 01:14:54,241
<i>for the largest purse
in mixed martial arts history.</i>

1082
01:14:54,324 --> 01:14:57,327
<i>In the town everyone knows
from the game of Monopoly,</i>

1083
01:14:57,411 --> 01:15:00,455
<i>we got ourselves a winner-take-all affair.</i>

1084
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:05,836
<i>Buckle yours eat belts, roll the dice,
and take a ride on the Reading.</i>

1085
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:09,047
<i>Sparta is here!</i>

1086
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:11,133
Welcome, I'm Bryan Callen,

1087
01:15:11,216 --> 01:15:13,969
along with bestselling fight author,
Sam Sheridan.

1088
01:15:14,094 --> 01:15:17,139
Sam, when J.J. Riley conceived Sparta,

1089
01:15:17,222 --> 01:15:19,099
he wanted to create, quite simply,

1090
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:23,103
the biggest mixed martial arts spectacle
in history.

1091
01:15:23,353 --> 01:15:26,398
$5 million, Bryan. $5 million.

1092
01:15:26,481 --> 01:15:28,900
J.J. Riley put his money where his mouth is

1093
01:15:28,984 --> 01:15:32,404
and put up the biggest purse
the sport has ever seen.

1094
01:15:32,487 --> 01:15:34,281
It's unprecedented, Sam.

1095
01:15:34,364 --> 01:15:38,702
As is the hoopla surrounding
one Tommy Riordan, the war hero,

1096
01:15:38,785 --> 01:15:41,204
who has become an overnight sensation

1097
01:15:41,288 --> 01:15:43,290
and captured the imagination
and attention...

1098
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:49,129
<i>...Jujitsu black belt Francisco Barbosa,</i>

1099
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:52,466
<i>who has a 19 to four record
in his mixed martial arts' career.</i>

1100
01:15:52,966 --> 01:15:55,302
<i>Our rules of the cage are brought to you
by Tapout.</i>

1101
01:15:58,305 --> 01:16:01,016
- Five minutes, Paddy.
- Okay.

1102
01:16:03,059 --> 01:16:06,646
<i>It looks as though the moment of truth
has arrived,</i>

1103
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:09,441
<i>-because here comes Tommy Riordan.
- Wow!</i>

1104
01:16:09,524 --> 01:16:11,735
<i>Tommy Riordan's
captured the media's attention,</i>

1105
01:16:11,818 --> 01:16:13,779
<i>but the question still remains.</i>

1106
01:16:13,987 --> 01:16:15,238
Who is this guy?

1107
01:16:15,322 --> 01:16:16,782
And more importantly,

1108
01:16:16,865 --> 01:16:19,785
can he compete in this talent pool?
Can he win?

1109
01:16:19,868 --> 01:16:21,620
I wish I knew. I wish I knew who he was.

1110
01:16:21,703 --> 01:16:25,415
And I say the fact that I don't know
is very strange.

1111
01:16:25,499 --> 01:16:27,667
In an Internet age
where there are no secrets,

1112
01:16:27,751 --> 01:16:29,628
this guy's a complete mystery.

1113
01:16:29,711 --> 01:16:31,671
I can't find out anything about him.

1114
01:16:31,838 --> 01:16:34,841
Tommy Riordan is officially Google-proof.

1115
01:16:37,636 --> 01:16:39,513
Get your hands off me.

1116
01:16:40,806 --> 01:16:41,848
Okay, let's go.

1117
01:16:41,932 --> 01:16:43,225
You gotta love this guy, Sam.

1118
01:16:43,308 --> 01:16:46,186
No walk-out music,
no sponsors, no interviews.

1119
01:16:46,311 --> 01:16:48,146
He skipped the press conference,

1120
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:50,607
wouldn't have his picture taken
for the program.

1121
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:52,442
He's breaking every rule.

1122
01:16:53,151 --> 01:16:55,779
The only reason, really,
that Tommy Riordan is in this tournament

1123
01:16:55,862 --> 01:17:00,367
is an MMA video making the rounds of him
beating up Mad Dog Grimes in the gym.

1124
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:03,161
But the reason
that a lot of his fans are in the stands

1125
01:17:03,245 --> 01:17:04,830
is because of another video.

1126
01:17:04,913 --> 01:17:07,582
It's even more stunning
than the Mad Dog Grimes video.

1127
01:17:07,666 --> 01:17:09,417
This guy... Let me describe it to you, folks,

1128
01:17:09,543 --> 01:17:11,795
for the few that haven't seen it,
and I don't know anybody who hasn't,

1129
01:17:11,878 --> 01:17:15,423
but Tommy Riordan ripped the door
off a tank

1130
01:17:15,507 --> 01:17:18,468
in the heat of battle,
saving lives in the process,

1131
01:17:18,552 --> 01:17:20,512
and then walked away
without claiming a medal.

1132
01:17:20,595 --> 01:17:21,930
- Listen...
- He ripped the door off a tank.

1133
01:17:22,013 --> 01:17:23,890
Tommy Riordan is a genuine war hero.

1134
01:17:23,974 --> 01:17:27,310
I'm not taking anything away from the guy,
he's a very, very tough guy,

1135
01:17:27,394 --> 01:17:30,063
- but the tank don't hit back, you know.
- Sam...

1136
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:32,566
We've seen YouTube sensations fail
on a big stage before.

1137
01:17:32,649 --> 01:17:35,110
Sam, he ripped the door off a tank!

1138
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:40,699
<i>Tommy Riordan,
he has definitely got his hands full</i>

1139
01:17:40,782 --> 01:17:43,285
<i>in his first opponent, Francisco Barbosa.</i>

1140
01:17:43,368 --> 01:17:44,828
<i>-Francisco Barbosa...
- He's nothing to scoff at.</i>

1141
01:17:44,911 --> 01:17:46,621
<i>Yeah, he's the octopus. He's the real deal.</i>

1142
01:17:47,747 --> 01:17:50,876
<i>He's a very, very tough guy,
a very high-caliber fighter.</i>

1143
01:17:50,959 --> 01:17:52,627
<i>Now, Tommy Riordan came out of nowhere,</i>

1144
01:17:52,711 --> 01:17:55,088
<i>and I'd imagine he's gonna disappear
just as quickly.</i>

1145
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,172
<i>It's a great story,</i>

1146
01:17:56,256 --> 01:17:59,301
but I think your boy
is gonna be exposed here

1147
01:17:59,426 --> 01:18:00,844
- as a YouTube sensation.
- Well, well,

1148
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:04,055
a lot of fans here in Boardwalk Hall
hope you're wrong, Sam.

1149
01:18:04,598 --> 01:18:06,308
All right, gentlemen,
you've been given your instructions.

1150
01:18:06,391 --> 01:18:07,934
I expect a clean fight.

1151
01:18:08,018 --> 01:18:09,352
Obey my command at all times,

1152
01:18:09,436 --> 01:18:10,729
defend yourselves at all times.

1153
01:18:11,062 --> 01:18:12,606
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1154
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:17,235
Tommy, cut off the corners,
feel this guy out,

1155
01:18:17,319 --> 01:18:18,778
just like we know. Just like we know.

1156
01:18:18,862 --> 01:18:21,740
We're about to get the big answer
to the big question.

1157
01:18:21,823 --> 01:18:24,034
Is Tommy Riordan for real?

1158
01:18:24,117 --> 01:18:26,328
- Gentlemen, you ready?
- They are both game fighters.

1159
01:18:26,411 --> 01:18:28,163
- And here we go.
- You ready?

1160
01:18:28,288 --> 01:18:29,372
Let's go to war!

1161
01:18:29,456 --> 01:18:31,041
Keep your focus, Tom.

1162
01:18:31,124 --> 01:18:32,876
And here we go. We're gonna see this.

1163
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,336
Barbosa's gonna be looking for a takedown.

1164
01:18:34,419 --> 01:18:36,463
He's definitely looking for a takedown here.

1165
01:18:41,092 --> 01:18:44,304
Barbosa is down!
Barbosa has been knocked out!

1166
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:47,557
Tommy Riordan is most definitely for real.

1167
01:18:47,641 --> 01:18:51,227
And now he's walking out of the cage.
He's leaving the cage.

1168
01:18:51,311 --> 01:18:52,854
Hey, Tommy!

1169
01:18:52,938 --> 01:18:55,023
There goes another rule, out the window!

1170
01:18:55,815 --> 01:18:57,150
Where you going?

1171
01:18:57,609 --> 01:19:00,278
Francisco Barbosa is out cold,

1172
01:19:00,362 --> 01:19:03,031
and he is out of this tournament, Bryan.

1173
01:19:03,949 --> 01:19:05,951
- <i>A huge left hook, launching...</i>
- Good. Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

1174
01:19:06,034 --> 01:19:08,912
- <i>... Tommy Riordan into the second round.</i>
- One, two. Good, good. One, two, three.

1175
01:19:08,995 --> 01:19:11,539
Good. Two, three.

1176
01:19:11,623 --> 01:19:13,291
Good. Good, good, good.

1177
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:16,252
- Good. Come on. Good. One, two.
- <i>Tommy Riordan is the real deal.</i>

1178
01:19:17,837 --> 01:19:20,423
- Showtime.
- All right. Come on, give me eight.

1179
01:19:22,926 --> 01:19:25,095
Yes! That's my boy.

1180
01:20:08,054 --> 01:20:09,723
Let's go, move your head around.

1181
01:20:16,146 --> 01:20:17,689
You ready?

1182
01:20:21,526 --> 01:20:22,902
Look at me.

1183
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:28,491
You can do this.

1184
01:20:35,081 --> 01:20:36,875
I wanna hear you say it.

1185
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:43,506
I can do this.

1186
01:20:44,382 --> 01:20:46,009
Let's go do this.

1187
01:20:47,719 --> 01:20:48,970
Yeah.

1188
01:20:54,184 --> 01:20:55,310
Yeah.

1189
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:06,946
J.J. Riley only had 48 hours,
less than 48 hours, to fill the spot.

1190
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:09,908
And basically, he had to go on the road
to Frank Campana.

1191
01:21:09,991 --> 01:21:12,077
Well, then he chose Brendan Conlon,

1192
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,912
which is really something
I don't understand.

1193
01:21:13,995 --> 01:21:15,955
I just... I'm shocked.

1194
01:21:20,794 --> 01:21:23,088
Hey, Brendan. Brendan, go get him.

1195
01:21:26,216 --> 01:21:27,467
Go. Good luck.

1196
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:30,220
Let's go, Brendan.

1197
01:21:31,096 --> 01:21:32,931
You go get him, Son!

1198
01:21:33,014 --> 01:21:35,100
You know, I can understand
coming out to no music,

1199
01:21:35,183 --> 01:21:38,728
but why in the world would you choose
classical music as your entrance?

1200
01:21:38,812 --> 01:21:41,606
This is Beethoven.
This is <i>Ode to Joy,</i> Bryan.

1201
01:21:41,689 --> 01:21:43,650
My apologies, Mr. Renaissance Man.

1202
01:21:45,193 --> 01:21:46,861
Go get him, Son.

1203
01:21:46,945 --> 01:21:50,532
If you wanna talk about Renaissance men,
you gotta talk about Frank Campana.

1204
01:21:50,615 --> 01:21:53,660
Very unorthodox trainer,
but one of the best trainers in the game,

1205
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:57,997
and he's well known for using classical
music to teach his fighters to remain calm,

1206
01:21:58,081 --> 01:22:01,501
to remain patient,
and to remain composed under pressure.

1207
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:05,213
You know, I'll tell you, classical music
is about as fitting to this setting

1208
01:22:05,296 --> 01:22:08,007
as Brendan Conlon is to this tournament.

1209
01:22:08,174 --> 01:22:09,509
- Come on.
- In fact, let me show you something.

1210
01:22:09,592 --> 01:22:10,593
Right here. Let me tell you...

1211
01:22:10,677 --> 01:22:12,095
- What?
- You see that, right there?

1212
01:22:12,178 --> 01:22:16,015
That, right there...
That, my friend, is Brendan Conlon.

1213
01:22:16,224 --> 01:22:19,978
Okay? Brendan Conlon's about
to be dropped into a shark tank.

1214
01:22:20,061 --> 01:22:21,312
He's a feeder fish.

1215
01:22:21,396 --> 01:22:22,897
Come on, give the guy a break.

1216
01:22:22,981 --> 01:22:25,316
You know, the guy...
At least we've seen him fight.

1217
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,861
I mean, he's fought real guys.
He's been in the UFC.

1218
01:22:27,944 --> 01:22:29,904
- We remember him from that.
- I remember him, too.

1219
01:22:29,988 --> 01:22:32,031
I remember him being very unmemorable.

1220
01:22:52,135 --> 01:22:55,346
Midnight Le getting ready
to climb into the cage and go to work.

1221
01:22:55,430 --> 01:22:56,472
When the brackets were announced,

1222
01:22:56,556 --> 01:22:58,391
he thought he'd be going up
against Marco Santos.

1223
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:01,436
He's got to be thrilled to be seeing
Brendan Conlon across from him.

1224
01:23:01,519 --> 01:23:03,605
Hey! You asked for it.

1225
01:23:04,397 --> 01:23:06,983
Brendan retired from fighting
some years ago.

1226
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:09,652
He's actually
a high school physics teacher now,

1227
01:23:09,736 --> 01:23:12,655
and Midnight had some fun with that
at the press conference yesterday.

1228
01:23:12,739 --> 01:23:15,408
Well, he said he was going to give
the teacher a serious lesson,

1229
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:18,828
and that getting killed was no way
to spend a summer vacation.

1230
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:22,582
Midnight is known for talking trash,
he's also known for backing it up.

1231
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:24,626
No question, Bryan.
He's in a lot of trouble here.

1232
01:23:24,709 --> 01:23:28,338
- Midnight Le is an agent of destruction.
- Gentlemen.

1233
01:23:30,965 --> 01:23:32,342
Go get him.

1234
01:23:35,553 --> 01:23:37,096
All right, guys,
you've been given your instructions.

1235
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:38,598
I expect a clean fight.

1236
01:23:38,681 --> 01:23:42,185
Obey my commands at all times.
Defend yourselves at all times.

1237
01:23:42,268 --> 01:23:44,437
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1238
01:23:45,897 --> 01:23:47,774
Go have some fun, baby.

1239
01:23:52,028 --> 01:23:53,279
Gentlemen, you ready?

1240
01:23:54,864 --> 01:23:56,950
You ready? Let's go to war!

1241
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,872
Work your kicks!

1242
01:24:02,956 --> 01:24:04,290
Work your kicks!

1243
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:08,836
Come on, Brendan, come on.

1244
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:10,797
Move! You gotta move, you gotta move.

1245
01:24:11,631 --> 01:24:13,383
Let it out! Come on, move!

1246
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:19,264
Stay away from the legs! Circle!

1247
01:24:19,389 --> 01:24:20,765
In and out!

1248
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:28,648
Get off the fence!

1249
01:24:30,233 --> 01:24:32,151
Get through this. Sprawl down!

1250
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:35,697
Get off the fence! Get off the fence!

1251
01:24:37,156 --> 01:24:38,574
There he goes!

1252
01:24:38,658 --> 01:24:39,993
Come on, Brendan. Get out of there!

1253
01:24:40,618 --> 01:24:41,911
Come on!

1254
01:24:42,829 --> 01:24:43,871
Get up!

1255
01:24:45,373 --> 01:24:47,500
- Come on! Come on!
- Watch the back of the head!

1256
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,752
- Relax, you're okay. You're okay!
- Midnight is all over Brendan.

1257
01:24:49,836 --> 01:24:52,338
Well, this can't last much longer.
This won't last much longer.

1258
01:24:52,422 --> 01:24:54,841
The teacher just has no answers.

1259
01:24:54,924 --> 01:24:56,926
Get out of there! Get out of there!

1260
01:24:58,428 --> 01:25:00,722
- And now, he's got the hooks in.
- The hooks are in.

1261
01:25:00,805 --> 01:25:02,849
- Brendan in very big trouble.
- The end is close.

1262
01:25:02,974 --> 01:25:04,851
Can Brendan make the end of the round?

1263
01:25:05,727 --> 01:25:06,769
Well, he's got the choke.

1264
01:25:06,853 --> 01:25:08,438
- He's got 20 seconds left in the round...
- Come on.

1265
01:25:08,521 --> 01:25:11,607
...and Conlon's face is turning purple.
This looks like it's over.

1266
01:25:11,691 --> 01:25:13,985
Get up! Find his legs!

1267
01:25:14,068 --> 01:25:15,945
Hips! Hip down!

1268
01:25:16,029 --> 01:25:18,406
Hip down! Get your weight down!

1269
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:19,949
Get your weight down!

1270
01:25:20,033 --> 01:25:22,493
Well, Midnight is squeezing
with all his might. He's got it very deep.

1271
01:25:22,577 --> 01:25:25,163
- Ten seconds! Don't you tap!
- Ten seconds, Bryan, 10 seconds.

1272
01:25:25,288 --> 01:25:27,415
Don't tap! Brendan, don't you tap!

1273
01:25:27,957 --> 01:25:28,958
Hold on, Brendan.

1274
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:30,543
<i>Conlon doing his best to hang on,</i>

1275
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,587
'cause his whole world's about to go
from day to night.

1276
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:34,922
Don't you tap! Don't you tap, Brendan!

1277
01:25:38,051 --> 01:25:40,219
I cannot believe that, Sam!

1278
01:25:40,303 --> 01:25:42,472
I thought for sure this guy
was going to sleep.

1279
01:25:45,058 --> 01:25:47,101
Midnight can't believe it either, by the way.

1280
01:25:48,061 --> 01:25:49,604
Jesus.

1281
01:25:52,607 --> 01:25:55,026
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1282
01:25:55,109 --> 01:25:57,070
You should've had him in the first round.

1283
01:25:57,153 --> 01:25:58,988
You should've had him in the first round.

1284
01:26:00,114 --> 01:26:03,242
Beautiful. Beautiful.
He doesn't know what hit him.

1285
01:26:03,326 --> 01:26:05,161
He doesn't know what hit him. Breathe.

1286
01:26:05,745 --> 01:26:06,913
Deep breaths. Come on now.

1287
01:26:07,205 --> 01:26:09,374
Small sip, small sip. Small sip.

1288
01:26:09,457 --> 01:26:11,793
Deep breath, deep breath.
I want you to do something.

1289
01:26:12,919 --> 01:26:14,587
I want you to get him to pull, okay?

1290
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:17,423
When he pulls, I want you to hit him a bit
and I want you to shoot on him.

1291
01:26:17,507 --> 01:26:20,593
I'd love to be a fly on the wall,
listening to Frank Campana right now

1292
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:21,719
and hear what he's saying in there.

1293
01:26:21,803 --> 01:26:23,471
In and out. In and out. In and out.

1294
01:26:23,554 --> 01:26:26,557
And I want you to trade punches
with him, all right? You're doing beautiful.

1295
01:26:27,767 --> 01:26:29,519
Let's go, seconds out!

1296
01:26:29,602 --> 01:26:30,812
Knock him out. Knock him out.
Knock him out.

1297
01:26:30,895 --> 01:26:32,021
This round, knock him out.

1298
01:26:32,105 --> 01:26:34,190
- Let's do it.
- He doesn't deserve to be here.

1299
01:26:34,273 --> 01:26:36,234
Beautiful. Breathe.

1300
01:26:36,317 --> 01:26:37,610
Let's go!

1301
01:26:40,113 --> 01:26:43,324
And here we go. The teacher
answering the bell for round two.

1302
01:26:43,408 --> 01:26:44,492
Nice and easy!

1303
01:26:45,535 --> 01:26:47,537
Set the pace! Set the pace, Brendan!

1304
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:49,622
Gentlemen! Let's go to war!

1305
01:27:05,471 --> 01:27:08,224
Circle around! Circle around!

1306
01:27:08,891 --> 01:27:09,934
Nice and easy!

1307
01:27:11,102 --> 01:27:12,478
Good, good!

1308
01:27:12,562 --> 01:27:14,564
Shoot! Shoot on him!

1309
01:27:16,816 --> 01:27:21,237
Get out of there! Hitch him! Hitch him!
Hitch him!

1310
01:27:22,697 --> 01:27:25,032
Get out of there!
Get out of there! Get out of there! Come on!

1311
01:27:27,326 --> 01:27:28,494
Do something.

1312
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:32,415
Shoot! Shoot on him!

1313
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:34,208
Shoot on him!

1314
01:27:36,961 --> 01:27:38,045
Yes!

1315
01:27:38,129 --> 01:27:40,214
Conlon shoots on Midnight Le
and gets him down.

1316
01:27:40,298 --> 01:27:41,799
Midnight is trying to get to his...

1317
01:27:43,009 --> 01:27:44,844
- Scissors takedown.
- A beautiful scissors takedown.

1318
01:27:44,927 --> 01:27:46,804
- Really nice.
- Conlon showing signs of life

1319
01:27:46,888 --> 01:27:48,681
and not backing down.

1320
01:27:48,764 --> 01:27:49,974
Knees, knees!

1321
01:27:53,561 --> 01:27:54,604
Good!

1322
01:27:54,687 --> 01:27:56,814
Take his arm! Good!

1323
01:27:57,899 --> 01:28:00,776
- He's got a kimura lock!
- He's got a very good kimura.

1324
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:04,197
Turn your hips in! In!

1325
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:07,241
Up! Stay with him. Turn your hips in!

1326
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,120
Hips up! Turn your hips in!

1327
01:28:11,204 --> 01:28:12,497
Turn your hips in!

1328
01:28:12,997 --> 01:28:15,208
You got it, Brendan. Your round. You got it!

1329
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:17,460
Turn your hips up and in!

1330
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:19,629
Hips up! Very good!

1331
01:28:20,213 --> 01:28:21,297
<i>He's in a lot of trouble.</i>

1332
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:23,216
That's it! Come on! Come on!

1333
01:28:23,299 --> 01:28:26,260
- Wow! He's got it very, very deep.
- Midnight is in a very, very bad position.

1334
01:28:26,344 --> 01:28:27,428
Midnight is in big trouble.

1335
01:28:27,512 --> 01:28:30,473
Slow down! Relax! You got it! You got it!

1336
01:28:30,556 --> 01:28:32,183
Brendan Conlon is going
to finish it right here!

1337
01:28:32,266 --> 01:28:34,101
Brendan Conlon has got
him in a very, very dangerous position

1338
01:28:34,185 --> 01:28:35,853
- and Midnight is in big trouble.
- Midnight...

1339
01:28:35,937 --> 01:28:37,396
I don't think Midnight has anywhere to go.

1340
01:28:37,563 --> 01:28:39,565
You got it! You got it!

1341
01:28:39,982 --> 01:28:43,152
Slow down! Relax! You got it! You got it!

1342
01:28:43,611 --> 01:28:46,781
And this isn't... This isn't happening!

1343
01:28:46,864 --> 01:28:48,741
- This can't happen.
- It just did, Bryan.

1344
01:28:48,991 --> 01:28:49,992
He tapped!

1345
01:28:50,284 --> 01:28:52,119
Brendan Conlon tapped Midnight!

1346
01:28:52,203 --> 01:28:54,664
- I can't believe that.
- Oh, my goodness!

1347
01:28:54,747 --> 01:28:57,458
You got him! Way to go, Brendan!

1348
01:29:01,671 --> 01:29:03,798
Yeah! Yeah! He tapped him out.

1349
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:05,424
Honey, he tapped him out!

1350
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:08,636
He did it! He did it! He did it! He did it!

1351
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:11,347
Way to go, Brendan! Way to go! Yeah!

1352
01:29:11,806 --> 01:29:14,225
This is what's so great
about mixed martial arts.

1353
01:29:14,308 --> 01:29:16,060
There's so many ways to lose.

1354
01:29:16,143 --> 01:29:20,481
One tiny miscalculation,
anyone can win at anytime.

1355
01:29:20,565 --> 01:29:22,984
Which is probably why Frank Campana's
embracing his man.

1356
01:29:23,067 --> 01:29:27,863
And I honestly don't think either
one of them can believe what just happened.

1357
01:29:27,947 --> 01:29:30,408
Great show of sportsmanship here
from the teacher.

1358
01:29:30,491 --> 01:29:33,160
Well, that's a hallmark
of Frank Campana's philosophy,

1359
01:29:33,244 --> 01:29:34,870
something all his fighters buy into,

1360
01:29:34,954 --> 01:29:36,914
and, obviously, none more so than Brendan.

1361
01:29:36,998 --> 01:29:38,708
And Midnight Le is shocked.

1362
01:29:38,791 --> 01:29:40,793
He thought he'd get a free pass
into the second round,

1363
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:42,169
but, instead, he's going home.

1364
01:29:42,253 --> 01:29:46,465
Dominated the fight the entire way,
but he falls prey to a very technical finish.

1365
01:29:46,549 --> 01:29:48,593
A very technical finish, but that's a fluke.

1366
01:29:48,676 --> 01:29:50,636
- I don't care what anybody says. That is a...
- I don't know.

1367
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:53,556
You can call it a fluke, but I'm gonna call it
a guy maintaining composure

1368
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:55,474
and waiting for his opportunity.

1369
01:29:56,475 --> 01:29:59,729
Conlon beats Midnight! Unbelievable!

1370
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,357
I hope you got a receipt for your goldfish.

1371
01:30:26,297 --> 01:30:27,465
Yes!

1372
01:30:29,342 --> 01:30:30,343
Okay.

1373
01:30:42,438 --> 01:30:44,440
<i>We're down to eight fighters,
and soon to be seven,</i>

1374
01:30:44,523 --> 01:30:47,318
<i>as Koba prepares to go to work
for the second time tonight.</i>

1375
01:30:52,823 --> 01:30:53,949
- Right hand.
- Huge right hand.

1376
01:30:54,033 --> 01:30:55,409
- Huge right hand.
- Oh, my goodness.

1377
01:30:55,743 --> 01:30:57,828
Oh, my God! This is over.

1378
01:30:57,912 --> 01:30:59,830
Once again, Koba does not break a sweat.

1379
01:31:00,206 --> 01:31:02,792
<i>You got to be kidding me. I'm afraid
he might have broken something else.</i>

1380
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:04,251
That's certainly possible.

1381
01:31:04,377 --> 01:31:06,796
Koba moving on to tomorrow night.

1382
01:31:06,879 --> 01:31:08,881
- Koba! Koba!
- Koba! Koba!

1383
01:31:10,174 --> 01:31:12,635
<i>Mad Dog fighting like a man possessed.</i>

1384
01:31:12,718 --> 01:31:14,470
Like a man with something to prove,

1385
01:31:14,553 --> 01:31:18,557
<i>reminding everyone why he is a
serious contender to win this whole contest.</i>

1386
01:31:18,766 --> 01:31:22,895
<i>He wanted to send a message to
Tommy Riordan, and there it is, right there.</i>

1387
01:31:23,479 --> 01:31:25,648
Here comes the underdog, Brendan Conlon.

1388
01:31:25,731 --> 01:31:28,150
The teacher miraculously
passed his first test,

1389
01:31:28,234 --> 01:31:29,735
but now he's got to face The Dane.

1390
01:31:29,819 --> 01:31:32,363
Brendan! You can do it.

1391
01:31:35,157 --> 01:31:37,952
<i>Haltway through round three, now,
and the beating continues.</i>

1392
01:31:38,035 --> 01:31:42,081
I honestly don't know how Brendan Conlon
can take this kind of punishment.

1393
01:31:42,164 --> 01:31:44,083
He has been battered without mercy

1394
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:45,626
- in both of his fights today.
- Relax! You're okay!

1395
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:47,378
He's still standing, Bryan.

1396
01:31:49,296 --> 01:31:50,548
Beethoven!

1397
01:31:50,631 --> 01:31:52,216
No! No, no, no!

1398
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:55,511
Good, take him down!

1399
01:31:56,887 --> 01:31:58,514
Look at this, he's taking The Dane down!

1400
01:31:58,597 --> 01:31:59,640
Hold on to him.

1401
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:02,351
He's looking for that arm.
He's looking for the arm bar.

1402
01:32:02,435 --> 01:32:04,270
- He's got an arm bar.
- He's got that arm bar.

1403
01:32:04,353 --> 01:32:06,147
He's looking to be boss of it, once again.

1404
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:07,773
Tap, tap, tap! Come on, tap, tap, tap!

1405
01:32:08,691 --> 01:32:11,110
Palms flat! Palms flat! Thumbs up!

1406
01:32:11,944 --> 01:32:13,279
He's got that arm, Sam!

1407
01:32:13,446 --> 01:32:15,865
- Break, break, break, break!
- Yes!

1408
01:32:15,948 --> 01:32:16,991
Are you kidding me?

1409
01:32:17,825 --> 01:32:18,868
Yes!

1410
01:32:18,951 --> 01:32:21,328
Do it once, it's a fluke.
Do it twice, and it's something else.

1411
01:32:21,412 --> 01:32:24,707
Pull the bandwagon over,
I think I am hopping on.

1412
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:26,375
I think I'm a believer.

1413
01:32:26,792 --> 01:32:29,295
You did it! Way to go, Brendan!

1414
01:32:29,462 --> 01:32:31,005
- I'm doing this!
- Okay.

1415
01:32:31,088 --> 01:32:32,298
- I'm doing it!
- Okay.

1416
01:32:32,381 --> 01:32:33,591
Okay, Son.

1417
01:32:34,258 --> 01:32:37,261
The crowd catching fire
for the hero Tommy Riordan.

1418
01:32:38,804 --> 01:32:40,556
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1419
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:43,267
He doesn't seem to want
anything to do with all this adulation.

1420
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:45,060
He's just here to fight.

1421
01:32:45,144 --> 01:32:47,605
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1422
01:32:47,688 --> 01:32:49,148
Gentlemen, you ready?

1423
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:51,233
Are you ready?

1424
01:32:51,317 --> 01:32:53,527
- Let's go to war!
- Right at him! Right at him! Right at him!

1425
01:32:54,570 --> 01:32:56,739
Well, here he comes again like a buzz saw!

1426
01:32:59,784 --> 01:33:02,578
- Yeah.
- He is all over Diego Santana.

1427
01:33:04,955 --> 01:33:07,833
He's swarming all over him,
and now he's beating on him without mercy!

1428
01:33:07,958 --> 01:33:08,959
Oh, my goodness!

1429
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:20,638
There he goes again,
storming out of the cage!

1430
01:33:20,721 --> 01:33:23,557
Tommy Riordan marching off
through the crowd

1431
01:33:23,641 --> 01:33:27,311
and straight into the final four,
ladies and gentlemen.

1432
01:33:27,394 --> 01:33:30,022
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1433
01:33:56,715 --> 01:33:58,926
- So where is he?
- Yeah. Mr. Conlon.

1434
01:33:59,635 --> 01:34:01,262
Make a right at that white sign...

1435
01:34:10,771 --> 01:34:13,566
Hey! Can't sleep, huh?

1436
01:34:20,698 --> 01:34:24,076
I know that that other thing is

1437
01:34:26,537 --> 01:34:29,123
bothering the hell out of you.

1438
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:32,710
I'm proud of you, Tommy.

1439
01:34:33,627 --> 01:34:36,297
What you did for that kid in the tank,

1440
01:34:37,047 --> 01:34:39,091
that was really something.

1441
01:34:42,219 --> 01:34:44,346
How about deserting my unit?

1442
01:34:45,890 --> 01:34:48,100
Is that really something, too?

1443
01:34:51,228 --> 01:34:52,479
Yeah.

1444
01:34:53,272 --> 01:34:57,276
I was on my way out of the country
when I came across those guys.

1445
01:34:58,110 --> 01:34:59,904
What was I supposed to do?
Let them drown?

1446
01:34:59,987 --> 01:35:01,113
No.

1447
01:35:04,325 --> 01:35:06,702
- What did you do?
- What did I do?

1448
01:35:09,455 --> 01:35:10,915
I took off.

1449
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:16,670
That's why you go by Riordan.

1450
01:35:18,005 --> 01:35:21,133
That's why they can't
find your service records.

1451
01:35:24,428 --> 01:35:27,222
What the hell happened over there, Tommy?

1452
01:35:28,432 --> 01:35:30,267
That is none of your business, man.

1453
01:35:30,351 --> 01:35:33,187
Come on, kiddo. You know, I've been there.

1454
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:35,731
I've done it, I've seen it.

1455
01:35:35,814 --> 01:35:37,399
You can trust me. I understand.

1456
01:35:37,483 --> 01:35:40,527
Will you spare me the
compassionate father routine, Pop?

1457
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:43,656
The suit don't fit.

1458
01:35:44,490 --> 01:35:45,658
Tommy.

1459
01:35:46,575 --> 01:35:48,619
I'm really trying here.

1460
01:35:49,536 --> 01:35:52,206
- You're trying?
- Yeah, really. I'm trying.

1461
01:35:52,331 --> 01:35:53,457
Now?

1462
01:35:56,126 --> 01:35:58,462
Where were you when it mattered?

1463
01:35:59,546 --> 01:36:03,509
I needed this guy back when I was a kid.
I don't need you now.

1464
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:07,680
You know, it's too late now.
Everything's already happened.

1465
01:36:08,681 --> 01:36:11,767
You and Brendan
don't seem to understand that.

1466
01:36:12,476 --> 01:36:15,396
Let me explain something to you, okay?

1467
01:36:15,479 --> 01:36:18,774
The only thing that I have in common
with Brendan Conlon

1468
01:36:18,857 --> 01:36:20,734
is that the pair of us,

1469
01:36:21,902 --> 01:36:24,613
we have absolutely no use for you.

1470
01:36:29,159 --> 01:36:30,536
Look at you.

1471
01:36:31,787 --> 01:36:34,331
Yeah, I was right.

1472
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,126
I think I liked you better
when you were a drunk.

1473
01:36:37,209 --> 01:36:39,336
At least you had some balls then,
not like now,

1474
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:43,590
tiptoeing around,
like some beggar with your cup out.

1475
01:36:46,385 --> 01:36:48,595
Take it somewhere else.
In fact, you know what?

1476
01:36:48,679 --> 01:36:49,722
Here's a cup.

1477
01:36:49,805 --> 01:36:53,183
Why don't you take this and go get yourself
some more of your shitty tapes...

1478
01:36:53,267 --> 01:36:55,144
- Don't do this, Tommy.
- ...and you go back to the room

1479
01:36:55,227 --> 01:36:56,895
- and you listen to some more...
- Don't do this.

1480
01:36:56,979 --> 01:37:00,482
...fish stories that no one gives a shit about.
Now get out of here.

1481
01:37:02,234 --> 01:37:04,570
Get the fuck out of here! Go on.

1482
01:37:43,859 --> 01:37:45,402
<i>God pity them!</i>

1483
01:37:45,986 --> 01:37:48,489
<i>All shall perish except me!</i>

1484
01:37:52,493 --> 01:37:56,038
<i>Bastards. Bastards!</i>

1485
01:37:57,289 --> 01:38:00,292
You bastards. You bastards!

1486
01:38:00,709 --> 01:38:03,879
Stop the ship, you bastards!

1487
01:38:03,962 --> 01:38:06,298
Ishmael. God pity them.

1488
01:38:07,007 --> 01:38:10,427
Stop the ship. Please, stop the ship.

1489
01:38:12,638 --> 01:38:15,224
Stop the ship! Somebody.

1490
01:38:16,642 --> 01:38:17,976
Ahab.

1491
01:38:18,685 --> 01:38:21,146
You godless son of a bitch!

1492
01:38:21,230 --> 01:38:23,107
You stop the ship!

1493
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:26,318
You godless son of a bitch!

1494
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:30,405
<i>"'The whale! The ship!'
cried the cringing oarsmen.</i>

1495
01:38:30,489 --> 01:38:32,491
<i>"'Oars! Oars! Slope downward... "'</i>

1496
01:38:32,574 --> 01:38:33,784
Stop it.

1497
01:38:33,992 --> 01:38:36,537
<i>"'O sea that ere it be for ever too late,</i>

1498
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:40,040
<i>"'Ahab may slide this last,
last time upon his mark!"'</i>

1499
01:38:41,834 --> 01:38:43,252
Captain...

1500
01:38:44,461 --> 01:38:46,380
Stop the...

1501
01:38:46,463 --> 01:38:48,757
Captain, stop...

1502
01:38:48,841 --> 01:38:51,176
Stop the ship, Ahab.

1503
01:38:52,678 --> 01:38:54,680
For the love of God.

1504
01:38:55,806 --> 01:38:57,391
They're lost.

1505
01:38:58,433 --> 01:39:00,352
Stop it... The ship.

1506
01:39:04,356 --> 01:39:05,566
Ahab...

1507
01:39:08,735 --> 01:39:10,362
You stop the...

1508
01:39:14,783 --> 01:39:16,326
Oh, no.

1509
01:39:20,789 --> 01:39:22,833
- Come on, give me the Walkman.
- No.

1510
01:39:22,916 --> 01:39:25,127
- No, no.
- Come on.

1511
01:39:25,210 --> 01:39:27,087
Come on, come on.
Come, give me the bottle.

1512
01:39:27,171 --> 01:39:29,131
Come here, come here, come here.

1513
01:39:29,214 --> 01:39:31,550
- Come on. Give me.
- No.

1514
01:39:41,852 --> 01:39:43,187
Tommy.

1515
01:39:44,188 --> 01:39:45,898
We're lost.

1516
01:39:47,649 --> 01:39:49,401
We're lost, Tommy.

1517
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:54,198
It's over. We'll never make it back.

1518
01:39:56,074 --> 01:39:58,785
- Stay down.
- We'll never make it back.

1519
01:40:09,713 --> 01:40:10,964
I'm here.

1520
01:40:16,637 --> 01:40:18,430
I always loved you.

1521
01:40:20,599 --> 01:40:22,976
You know that, don't you, Tommy?

1522
01:40:23,769 --> 01:40:25,562
I always loved you.

1523
01:40:27,105 --> 01:40:30,484
You and your brother. My two boys.

1524
01:40:45,999 --> 01:40:49,294
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1525
01:41:02,849 --> 01:41:06,436
Tommy Riordan coming down the tunnel
without his trainer.

1526
01:41:11,441 --> 01:41:13,652
<i>Once again, no walk-out music.</i>

1527
01:41:16,822 --> 01:41:19,324
I'd hardly say no music, Sam.

1528
01:41:24,162 --> 01:41:27,374
Bryan, it sounds like V-J day
in Times Square.

1529
01:41:27,457 --> 01:41:29,459
I've never seen anything like this.

1530
01:41:46,727 --> 01:41:49,438
Tommy acknowledging his comrades
for the first time

1531
01:41:49,521 --> 01:41:51,690
and climbing into the cage.

1532
01:41:56,361 --> 01:41:58,613
Mad Dog Grimes has been
waiting for revenge

1533
01:41:58,697 --> 01:42:01,408
ever since the day Tommy Riordan
walked into his gym in Pittsburgh

1534
01:42:01,491 --> 01:42:03,327
and turned his life upside down.

1535
01:42:03,410 --> 01:42:07,122
It's been a very long and very miserable
few months for Mad Dog, to say the least.

1536
01:42:08,665 --> 01:42:13,128
Grimes mocking Riordan by having
a camouflage motif for his mohawk tonight,

1537
01:42:13,211 --> 01:42:16,506
and the Marines are really
letting Mad Dog have it.

1538
01:42:20,093 --> 01:42:21,553
All right, gentlemen.

1539
01:42:26,224 --> 01:42:27,768
All right, gentlemen,
we've been over your instructions.

1540
01:42:27,851 --> 01:42:29,144
I expect a clean fight.

1541
01:42:29,227 --> 01:42:32,147
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1542
01:42:32,230 --> 01:42:34,107
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1543
01:42:34,191 --> 01:42:36,068
It's not gonna happen again.

1544
01:42:37,569 --> 01:42:41,198
Mad Dog chomping at the bit here.
He can't wait to get a piece of Tommy.

1545
01:42:41,281 --> 01:42:42,699
He predicted an early knockout.

1546
01:42:42,783 --> 01:42:45,494
He said he was gonna
take Tommy out with one punch.

1547
01:42:45,577 --> 01:42:48,121
And by the way, he said,
"They're gonna have to pull me off him."

1548
01:42:48,205 --> 01:42:51,083
We'll see what Tommy has to say about that.

1549
01:42:52,584 --> 01:42:54,086
Gentlemen, you ready?

1550
01:42:54,711 --> 01:42:55,921
You ready?

1551
01:42:57,839 --> 01:43:00,050
- Let's go to war!
- Here they go and they are off!

1552
01:43:01,593 --> 01:43:04,012
Tommy tackles him, and he's on top!

1553
01:43:04,096 --> 01:43:05,764
He's raining bombs!

1554
01:43:06,098 --> 01:43:08,266
- Cover up!
- Come on, work it.

1555
01:43:09,351 --> 01:43:10,977
- Raining bombs.
- Mad Dog is out.

1556
01:43:11,061 --> 01:43:13,188
Mad Dog's in trouble. Please stop this.

1557
01:43:13,271 --> 01:43:14,773
Stop it! Stop the fight!

1558
01:43:16,775 --> 01:43:18,819
Break! Break! Break!

1559
01:43:21,571 --> 01:43:23,365
That's the fastest knockout I think
I've ever experienced!

1560
01:43:23,448 --> 01:43:26,910
Mad Dog Grimes has been poleaxed.
He is not moving.

1561
01:43:28,703 --> 01:43:32,416
You do that to someone on the street,
they lock you up and throw away the key.

1562
01:43:32,499 --> 01:43:34,084
Break out the yellow tape, Sam.

1563
01:43:34,167 --> 01:43:36,920
This guy's walking away from the cage
like he's leaving a crime scene!

1564
01:43:37,003 --> 01:43:40,173
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1565
01:43:45,929 --> 01:43:48,807
- Everybody through. Come on, move it out.
- Sparta!

1566
01:43:59,943 --> 01:44:01,736
Yeah!

1567
01:44:03,738 --> 01:44:05,240
Mr. C! Mr. C!

1568
01:44:05,323 --> 01:44:06,741
I'm on your side.

1569
01:44:15,834 --> 01:44:17,335
Let's go.

1570
01:44:17,627 --> 01:44:20,464
- Principal Zito, there he is.
- Nice.

1571
01:44:24,509 --> 01:44:26,178
Let's go, Brendan.

1572
01:44:29,514 --> 01:44:33,143
Brendan Conlon came into this tournament
as 1,000-to-one underdog,

1573
01:44:33,226 --> 01:44:35,437
and now here he is in the final four.

1574
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:39,107
The crowd showing their appreciation.
He's getting quite the reception.

1575
01:44:39,191 --> 01:44:43,111
He's got a huge reception.
I mean, this guy shocked everybody.

1576
01:44:44,362 --> 01:44:46,323
Come on, come on. You all right?

1577
01:44:48,742 --> 01:44:50,577
You've got a visitor.

1578
01:44:52,787 --> 01:44:54,748
Second row, 10 o'clock.

1579
01:45:03,215 --> 01:45:04,466
You all right with that?

1580
01:45:09,387 --> 01:45:10,430
I love you.

1581
01:45:13,892 --> 01:45:16,102
And here comes the great Russian, Koba.

1582
01:45:16,186 --> 01:45:19,898
Koba is so intimidating
and his reputation is larger than life.

1583
01:45:19,981 --> 01:45:23,235
- Koba! Koba!
- Koba! Koba!

1584
01:45:28,532 --> 01:45:31,993
I want you to look right at him
when he comes in here. Look right at him.

1585
01:45:32,077 --> 01:45:34,788
All right? Don't take your eyes off him.

1586
01:46:02,274 --> 01:46:04,317
I'm proud of you, brother.

1587
01:46:04,943 --> 01:46:06,653
This is your cage.

1588
01:46:18,456 --> 01:46:19,874
Gentlemen.

1589
01:46:27,799 --> 01:46:29,342
All right, gentlemen,
we've been over your instructions.

1590
01:46:29,426 --> 01:46:30,885
I expect a clean fight.

1591
01:46:30,969 --> 01:46:33,722
Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

1592
01:46:33,805 --> 01:46:36,349
Touch gloves, go back, let's do this.

1593
01:46:40,228 --> 01:46:42,897
Should I be nervous for Brendan?
'Cause I am.

1594
01:46:42,981 --> 01:46:45,150
I wanna stop the fight
before it even gets going.

1595
01:46:45,233 --> 01:46:48,320
- Well, here we go.
- He's like a machine. Look at him.

1596
01:46:50,989 --> 01:46:52,657
Gentlemen, you ready?

1597
01:46:53,158 --> 01:46:54,868
You ready? Let's go to war!

1598
01:46:54,951 --> 01:46:56,453
Keep your hands up, Brendan. Hands up.

1599
01:46:56,536 --> 01:47:00,457
But now, the question is, how long
can Brendan Conlon stay alive?

1600
01:47:00,665 --> 01:47:01,833
Angle out of it!

1601
01:47:03,835 --> 01:47:05,337
Keep moving!

1602
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:09,424
Get out of there! Get out of there!

1603
01:47:13,678 --> 01:47:15,930
Keep moving! Keep moving!
Get away from him!

1604
01:47:16,014 --> 01:47:17,724
Hit him, babe! Hit him! Get in there!

1605
01:47:19,809 --> 01:47:21,853
- Crushing body shots.
- Relax, you're okay.

1606
01:47:21,936 --> 01:47:23,855
Conlon's down,
and Koba pounces and starts pounding!

1607
01:47:23,938 --> 01:47:25,315
Get up! Get up!

1608
01:47:25,398 --> 01:47:27,359
He's just pounding on him
like a side of beef.

1609
01:47:27,609 --> 01:47:28,985
Go, go, go. Get up!

1610
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:30,987
He's getting his ass whooped.

1611
01:47:33,823 --> 01:47:35,283
And now he's got him in the air!

1612
01:47:35,367 --> 01:47:37,035
Oh, God.

1613
01:47:37,118 --> 01:47:39,371
Relax, tie up his arm! Tie him up!

1614
01:47:43,041 --> 01:47:45,377
I think Campana has to think
seriously about...

1615
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:47,796
- How much abuse can one man take?
- ...continuing another round of this.

1616
01:47:47,879 --> 01:47:49,005
Go to war!

1617
01:47:52,884 --> 01:47:56,554
Just relax! Relax! Relax! Off the fence!

1618
01:47:57,764 --> 01:48:00,892
Brendan's going for a ride!

1619
01:48:00,975 --> 01:48:03,561
That one shook the entire building!

1620
01:48:05,230 --> 01:48:07,607
Man, he just threw him against the fence
like a rag doll.

1621
01:48:07,691 --> 01:48:11,486
Get up! Get up! Come on!
Hold on! Turn it in! Turn in!

1622
01:48:11,569 --> 01:48:13,279
And now he's on top! Koba's on top,

1623
01:48:13,363 --> 01:48:16,324
and he's finishing him, here. Look at this.
On the edge of blowing it.

1624
01:48:16,408 --> 01:48:18,326
Get off the fence, Brendan!

1625
01:48:18,410 --> 01:48:21,079
You wonder how Conlon can
take this kind of beating on his arms.

1626
01:48:21,162 --> 01:48:24,249
- His forearms and his hands.
- Drop that neck!

1627
01:48:24,332 --> 01:48:25,834
How much can one man take?

1628
01:48:26,751 --> 01:48:28,211
Break! Break! Break!

1629
01:48:30,505 --> 01:48:32,716
Everybody has got to be
a little bit concerned

1630
01:48:32,799 --> 01:48:35,552
about Brendan Conlon's bravery
getting him in trouble here.

1631
01:48:35,635 --> 01:48:37,595
His bravery could get him killed, frankly.

1632
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:39,848
And by the way,
he's got nothing more to prove.

1633
01:48:39,931 --> 01:48:41,725
- He's lasted two rounds with Koba.
- That's true, that's true.

1634
01:48:41,808 --> 01:48:43,935
And you wonder what's keeping this guy up.

1635
01:48:45,061 --> 01:48:46,980
Sit down. Sit down.

1636
01:48:48,106 --> 01:48:49,733
Breathe. Breathe!

1637
01:48:50,442 --> 01:48:52,569
Look at me. Look at me!

1638
01:48:52,652 --> 01:48:55,947
Wait up. Small sips. Hold it.
Hold it, small sips.

1639
01:48:58,992 --> 01:49:01,369
Why are we here?
Why are we here, Brendan?

1640
01:49:01,453 --> 01:49:02,912
Why are we here?
Are we here to win this fight?

1641
01:49:02,996 --> 01:49:04,247
Are we here to win this fight?

1642
01:49:04,330 --> 01:49:07,000
You tell me.
'Cause if we're not, I will throw in the towel.

1643
01:49:07,083 --> 01:49:09,043
We will get Tess and we will go home.

1644
01:49:09,127 --> 01:49:11,129
We'll go home, okay?

1645
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:14,132
You don't knock him out, you lose the fight.

1646
01:49:14,382 --> 01:49:16,176
Do you understand me?

1647
01:49:16,968 --> 01:49:20,013
You don't knock him out,
you don't have a home.

1648
01:49:20,472 --> 01:49:22,474
Let's go! Seconds out! Seconds out!

1649
01:49:41,659 --> 01:49:43,995
Gentlemen! Let's go to war!

1650
01:49:48,291 --> 01:49:51,711
Conlon somehow
answering the call to round three.

1651
01:49:51,795 --> 01:49:54,214
And Koba's all over him once again.

1652
01:49:57,300 --> 01:49:58,510
Brendan's giving back, Bryan.

1653
01:49:58,593 --> 01:50:00,428
I mean, there's signs of life
in Brendan Conlon.

1654
01:50:01,054 --> 01:50:02,847
He's starting to mix it up.

1655
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:12,357
Pummel, pummel, pummel.

1656
01:50:15,151 --> 01:50:17,529
He's taking Koba down,
but the Russian's back up.

1657
01:50:18,321 --> 01:50:20,114
Brendan shoots him again,
pressing him against the cage.

1658
01:50:20,198 --> 01:50:22,951
- Yes!
- Whoa, he's fallen deep into a guillotine.

1659
01:50:23,034 --> 01:50:24,911
Well, Conlon trapped in an iron vice here,

1660
01:50:24,994 --> 01:50:26,955
and Koba now squeezing his neck
for all it's worth,

1661
01:50:27,038 --> 01:50:28,039
trying to choke the teacher out.

1662
01:50:28,122 --> 01:50:30,959
Hips, hips, hips! Breathe! Breathe!

1663
01:50:31,042 --> 01:50:33,044
Ride it out! Ride it out!

1664
01:50:33,962 --> 01:50:35,630
Conlon looking for a way out.

1665
01:50:35,713 --> 01:50:38,550
- What is this?
- Just tossed Koba. Can you believe this?

1666
01:50:38,633 --> 01:50:41,302
He just shook off a guillotine
and tossed Koba.

1667
01:50:41,386 --> 01:50:43,596
Conlon's looking for an arm bar.
He's looking for that arm bar,

1668
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:46,224
- and he's trying to submit the Russian bear.
- Hips, hips, hips!

1669
01:50:46,307 --> 01:50:47,684
Yeah, you got him!
You got him! You got him!

1670
01:50:48,309 --> 01:50:50,103
Koba slips right out.

1671
01:50:50,645 --> 01:50:53,565
Conlon's staying after him.
He's squeezing the bear.

1672
01:50:53,898 --> 01:50:57,360
The tables have turned and the boy scout
is actually messing with the bear.

1673
01:50:57,443 --> 01:50:59,571
The teacher springing off the fence and
going for a mountain,

1674
01:50:59,654 --> 01:51:00,655
- but Koba's on his feet.
- Get up, get up!

1675
01:51:00,738 --> 01:51:02,240
He does not want to be
on the ground with Brendan

1676
01:51:02,323 --> 01:51:04,325
and his endless bag of submissions.

1677
01:51:04,409 --> 01:51:07,829
Koba trying to reestablish his dominance
with brutal shots to the face.

1678
01:51:07,912 --> 01:51:10,832
But Conlon's showing no fear.
This is a fight!

1679
01:51:10,915 --> 01:51:13,167
We have got ourselves a fight!

1680
01:51:16,921 --> 01:51:19,173
Wow, that's a huge elbow to the head.

1681
01:51:19,257 --> 01:51:21,509
And now, Conlon goes for a knee bar.
He's got it very deep!

1682
01:51:21,593 --> 01:51:23,595
He's got it very, very deep!

1683
01:51:23,928 --> 01:51:25,013
He's deep on that.

1684
01:51:25,763 --> 01:51:27,181
He's got Koba in a lot of pain.

1685
01:51:27,265 --> 01:51:29,058
We saw this with Midnight,
we saw it against The Dane,

1686
01:51:29,142 --> 01:51:30,852
and we're seeing it here! Brendan Conlon...

1687
01:51:31,185 --> 01:51:33,730
Break it! Break it! Break it!

1688
01:51:34,439 --> 01:51:35,857
Not letting out!

1689
01:51:35,940 --> 01:51:38,026
Conlon wrenching that knee
for all it's worth.

1690
01:51:38,109 --> 01:51:39,861
He's putting everything he has into it.

1691
01:51:41,362 --> 01:51:43,698
And Koba is screaming in pain.

1692
01:51:43,781 --> 01:51:44,782
Koba taps.

1693
01:51:44,866 --> 01:51:47,285
Koba has tapped!
Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!

1694
01:51:47,368 --> 01:51:51,164
I can't believe it!
Brendan Conlon has tapped Koba!

1695
01:51:51,247 --> 01:51:53,833
He's tapped Koba!

1696
01:51:53,917 --> 01:51:56,669
And Frank Campana can't believe it.

1697
01:51:56,753 --> 01:51:59,297
This whole place can't believe it.
I can't believe it.

1698
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:02,592
Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba.

1699
01:52:03,259 --> 01:52:06,804
- Tess!
- You got it! You did it!

1700
01:52:06,888 --> 01:52:10,183
Brendan taps the world Sambo
champ with a knee bar!

1701
01:52:10,266 --> 01:52:11,893
- Babe, you did it!
- Brendan Conlon!

1702
01:52:11,976 --> 01:52:14,729
- I don't know what to say. It's amazing!
- I don't know what I just saw.

1703
01:52:14,812 --> 01:52:16,981
I just don't know
how to put this into context.

1704
01:52:17,065 --> 01:52:19,901
That's gotta be the biggest upset
in MMA history.

1705
01:52:19,984 --> 01:52:22,070
I have never seen anything like this.

1706
01:52:22,153 --> 01:52:25,615
He tapped a world Sambo champion
in a knee bar!

1707
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:30,745
Brendan Conlon has tapped the great Koba!

1708
01:52:30,828 --> 01:52:34,666
Brendan Conlon, the physics teacher!
Brendan Conlon, the civilian!

1709
01:52:34,874 --> 01:52:36,918
He's done the impossible.

1710
01:52:37,001 --> 01:52:40,463
He has done the impossible.
He's pulled off a miracle.

1711
01:52:40,838 --> 01:52:44,676
This place is going crazy
because they've just seen a miracle.

1712

Gentlemen.

1747

Gentlemen, this is the final.
I expect a clean fight.

1748

Obey my commands at all times,
defend yourselves at all times.

Relax, Brendan, relax!

Get out! Get out of there!

1756
01:59:31,248 --> 01:59:32,917
Throw your hands!

1757

Throw your hands!

1758
01:59:36,253 --> 01:59:38,339
Don't lose it. No, no, no!

1759
01:59:38,422 --> 01:59:39,924
Move! Move!

1760
01:59:42,093 --> 01:59:45,262
Tie him up! Tie him up!
Control his moves. Control his moves.

1761
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:48,140
Control the arms!
Keep control in the arms! Breathe!

1762
01:59:48,682 --> 01:59:51,602
You're okay! Relax! Breathe!

1763
01:59:57,441 --> 01:59:59,610
Get up! Get up! Get up!

Break!

1768
02:00:09,537 --> 02:00:10,788
What was that?

1769
02:00:10,871 --> 02:00:12,289
Hey, come on, Josh!

1770
02:00:12,540 --> 02:00:13,624
What's up with that?

1771
02:00:13,958 --> 02:00:15,709
Hey, step back!

1772
02:00:15,793 --> 02:00:17,336
Watch that late blow!

1773
02:00:18,045 --> 02:00:19,296
Come on!

1774
02:00:27,471 --> 02:00:29,390
Come on, Josh! I mean, what is that?

1775
02:00:29,473 --> 02:00:31,642
Come on, come on. Sit down. Sit, sit, sit.

1776
02:00:31,725 --> 02:00:33,519
Sit... Brendan, sit down.

1777
02:00:33,602 --> 02:00:35,688
Look at me. Sit down.

1778
02:00:36,313 --> 02:00:38,482
Brendan, look at me. Look at me.

1779
02:00:39,692 --> 02:00:44,071
Look at me, Brendan. Let it go.
Let it go, okay?

1780
02:00:44,155 --> 02:00:46,699
Breathe. Beethoven.

1781
02:00:47,324 --> 02:00:50,703
Okay. He's coming right at you, right?
Exactly like we planned.

1782
02:00:50,786 --> 02:00:53,914
I want you to angle out,
hit and move every time. All right?

1783
02:00:53,998 --> 02:00:55,291
- Angle out and move.
- Good.

1784
02:00:55,374 --> 02:00:57,835
Breathe. Breathe. Come on, relax.

1785
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:02,756
- Okay. He's not your brother, right?
- Time's up!

1786
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:04,675
Look at me. He's not your brother, right?

1787
02:01:04,758 --> 02:01:05,843
- All right.
- He's in the way.

1788
02:01:05,968 --> 02:01:08,304
Seconds out. Wrap it up.

1789
02:01:08,387 --> 02:01:10,806
Taking a little more time for the cheap shot.

1790
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:15,186
Do your job, Josh.

1791
02:01:20,316 --> 02:01:21,692
Come on, babe. Come on.

1792
02:01:21,859 --> 02:01:23,444
Let's go to war.

1793
02:01:23,527 --> 02:01:24,528
Breathe!

1794
02:01:29,700 --> 02:01:31,911
Pace, pace! Control the pace!

1795
02:01:42,213 --> 02:01:43,214
Cover up!

1796
02:01:44,131 --> 02:01:46,467
Come on, get off the fence!

1797
02:01:46,550 --> 02:01:47,718
Get off the fence!

1798
02:01:48,552 --> 02:01:49,762
Hands up! Hands up!

1799
02:01:51,222 --> 02:01:54,141
Head up! You're all right! Relax! Breathe!

1800
02:01:56,143 --> 02:01:57,228
Yeah!

1801
02:02:03,734 --> 02:02:04,735
Get him!

1802
02:02:07,738 --> 02:02:10,783
- Huge throw. Huge.
- Look at that.

1803
02:02:10,866 --> 02:02:12,493
Turn in! Don't give him your back!

1804
02:02:12,576 --> 02:02:14,245
Turn in! Go! Good! Good!

1805
02:02:17,373 --> 02:02:19,500
Come on, get out of it! Go! Get up!

1806
02:02:21,043 --> 02:02:22,461
Control the arms! Control the arms!

1807
02:02:24,838 --> 02:02:27,383
Cover up, cover up. Push it!

1808
02:02:29,093 --> 02:02:30,594
Break free! Break! Break!

1809
02:02:32,346 --> 02:02:35,224
Good, good, good!
Clean break! Stop! Hey, stop!

1810
02:02:35,307 --> 02:02:36,934
- Come on.
- Here we go, mom.

1811
02:02:37,017 --> 02:02:40,563
Time to lock up your china,
the boys are at it again!

1812
02:02:46,527 --> 02:02:47,611
Let's go to war!

1813
02:03:05,588 --> 02:03:07,506
Now! Get up! Get up!

1814
02:03:08,507 --> 02:03:10,050
Get up! Come on, babe!
Get up! Get up! Get up!

1815
02:03:10,134 --> 02:03:11,969
Control it! Control it with the arms.

1816
02:03:12,052 --> 02:03:13,596
Switch! Switch!

1817
02:03:15,723 --> 02:03:17,057
Hips!

1818
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:19,351
Down, down. Hips down.

1819
02:03:23,147 --> 02:03:26,400
Oh, my God. That's a deep omoplata there.
He's got the seats up.

1820
02:03:27,818 --> 02:03:29,486
Come on, Tommy!

1821
02:03:34,283 --> 02:03:36,577
You've got him, babe! You've got him, babe!
Come on, tap him out!

1822
02:03:37,328 --> 02:03:38,454
Tom!

1823
02:03:45,961 --> 02:03:47,212
Break! Break! Break!

1824
02:03:47,296 --> 02:03:49,840
Tommy, you okay?

1825
02:03:54,345 --> 02:03:56,847
- Tommy!
- Go! Let's go! Go!

1826
02:03:56,930 --> 02:03:58,349
Calm down. Calm down.

1827
02:03:59,391 --> 02:04:01,935
- It's the championship. Keep it together.
- All right. All right. I got it.

1828
02:04:02,019 --> 02:04:03,520
Sit down. Sit down!

1829
02:04:10,986 --> 02:04:12,780
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1830
02:04:12,863 --> 02:04:16,075
- I popped his shoulder.
- Relax. Breathe. Breathe.

1831
02:04:16,158 --> 02:04:17,785
- I heard it tear.
- You popped his shoulder?

1832
02:04:17,868 --> 02:04:18,911
- Yeah.
- Good. Okay.

1833
02:04:18,994 --> 02:04:21,622
I want you to pop his other shoulder.
Let's go.

1834
02:04:21,705 --> 02:04:23,582
- Josh.
- Hey, hey, no Josh.

1835
02:04:23,666 --> 02:04:24,792
- Josh.
- Hey!

1836
02:04:24,875 --> 02:04:26,293
- Look at me. Look at me.
- What?

1837
02:04:26,377 --> 02:04:28,170
All right, you got two rounds. Two rounds.

1838
02:04:28,253 --> 02:04:29,546
We need both rounds.

1839
02:04:32,299 --> 02:04:33,384
What?

1840
02:04:33,467 --> 02:04:36,553
- Tommy! Tommy!
- Tommy! Tommy!

1841
02:04:43,102 --> 02:04:46,230
Go in there, you kick him in the head,
take him down and finish him!

1842
02:04:53,821 --> 02:04:56,198
Tommy, what are you doing?

1843
02:04:56,949 --> 02:04:58,575
Shut up. Come on.

1844
02:04:59,535 --> 02:05:00,994
Stand back.

1845
02:05:01,745 --> 02:05:04,873
Come on. What? Have you gone crazy?

1846
02:05:06,375 --> 02:05:08,043
Let's go to war!

1847
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:11,755
Brendan, pick your hands up!

1848
02:05:12,464 --> 02:05:13,716
It's over.

1849
02:05:14,925 --> 02:05:17,594
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1850
02:05:19,096 --> 02:05:20,764
It's over, Tommy.

1851
02:05:21,014 --> 02:05:22,015
You better fight!

1852
02:05:32,943 --> 02:05:35,028
It's over, Tommy. Come on.

1853
02:05:39,158 --> 02:05:41,535
Tommy, we don't have to do this.

1854
02:05:53,338 --> 02:05:55,924
Come on.
Why do you want to do this, Tommy?

1855
02:05:56,258 --> 02:05:57,593
Am I gonna have to watch you do this?

1856
02:06:05,267 --> 02:06:07,519
Okay? You all right there?

1857
02:06:08,312 --> 02:06:09,646
Tommy!

1858
02:06:20,073 --> 02:06:22,576
Quick, finish him! You finish him!

1859
02:06:29,249 --> 02:06:30,626
Come on.

1860
02:06:41,386 --> 02:06:44,348
Break, break, break! Back up, back up!

1861
02:08:41,882 --> 02:08:45,469
I'm sorry, Tommy. I'm sorry.

1862
02:08:48,680 --> 02:08:50,641
Tap, Tommy.

1863
02:08:51,308 --> 02:08:53,769
It's okay. It's okay.

1864
02:09:03,737 --> 02:09:05,280
I love you.

1865
02:09:06,490 --> 02:09:07,991
I love you, Tommy.
