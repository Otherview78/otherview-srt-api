1
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,682
Sometimes, I think I'm cursed.

2
00:01:12,143 --> 00:01:14,746
Because of something that happened before I was even born.

3
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,607
See, a long time ago,

4
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:18,829
there was this family.

5
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,076
The Papá, he was a musician.

6
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,586
He and his family would sing and dance

7
00:01:25,588 --> 00:01:26,909
and count their blessings.

8
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:29,554
But he also had a dream.

9
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,807
To play for the world.

10
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:35,622
And one day,

11
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:38,538
he left with his guitar,

12
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:40,925
and never returned.

13
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:50,271
And the Mamá.

14
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,734
She didn't have time to cry over that walk-away musician.

15
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,979
After banishing all music from her life

16
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,543
she found a way to provide for her daughter.

17
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,131
She rolled up her sleeves,

18
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,166
and she learned to make shoes.

19
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,197
She could have made candy,

20
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:19,191
or fireworks,

21
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:21,727
or sparkly underwear for wrestlers,

22
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:23,885
but no,

23
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:25,992
she chose shoes.

24
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,571
Then she taught her daughter to make shoes.

25
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,193
And later,

26
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:34,704
she taught her son-in-law.

27
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,833
Then her grandkids got roped in.

28
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,727
As her family grew,

29
00:02:40,935 --> 00:02:42,385
so did the business.

30
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,421
Music had torn her family apart.

31
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,549
But shoes held them all together.

32
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,657
You see that woman,

33
00:02:53,097 --> 00:02:54,529
was my great great-grandmother,

34
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:55,609
Mamá Imelda.

35
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,143
She died way before I was born.

36
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,849
But my family still tells her story

37
00:03:01,851 --> 00:03:04,305
every year on Día de los Muertos.

38
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:05,725
The Day of the Dead.

39
00:03:06,174 --> 00:03:07,505
And her little girl,

40
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,159
she's my great-grandmother,

41
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:10,008
Mamá Coco.

42
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,238
Hola, Mamá Coco.

43
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:14,948
How are you, Julio?

44
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,281
Actually, my name is Miguel.

45
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:21,036
Mamá Coco has trouble remembering things.

46
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:23,357
But it's good to talk to her anyway.

47
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:25,366
So, I tell her pretty much everything.

48
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,879
I used to run like this.

49
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:29,567
But now I run like this which is way faster.

50
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,265
And the winner is...

51
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,581
Luchadora Coco!

52
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,386
I have a dimple on this side, but not on this side.

53
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,343
Dimple, no dimple. Dimple, no dimple.

54
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,555
Miguel, eat your food.

55
00:03:40,557 --> 00:03:41,737
My abuelita,

56
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:43,186
she's Mamá Coco's daughter.

57
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,286
Oh, you're a twig, mijo.

58
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:47,277
Have some more. No, gracias.

59
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,731
I asked if you would like more tamales!

60
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,821
Sí?

61
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,210
That's what I thought you said!

62
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:58,142
Abuelita runs our house just like Mamá Imelda did.

63
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:01,916
No music!

64
00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:04,691
No music!

65
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,381
♪ Y aunque la vida ♪ No music!

66
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,548
I think we're the only family in México who hates music.

67
00:04:12,516 --> 00:04:14,037
And my family's fine with that.

68
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:15,200
But me...

69
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,349
Be back by lunch, mijo. Love you, Mamá.

70
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,019
I am not like the rest of my family!

71
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:24,029
Hola, Miguel! Hola!

72
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,859
Muchas gracias. De nada, Miguel.

73
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,121
Hey! Dante!

74
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,614
Sit. Down.

75
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,712
Roll over. Shake.

76
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,351
Fist bump!

77
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:47,628
Good boy, Dante!

78
00:04:51,345 --> 00:04:53,810
I know I'm not supposed to love music.

79
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,621
But it's not my fault!

80
00:04:56,204 --> 00:04:57,305
It's his!

81
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:59,560
Ernesto de la Cruz.

82
00:04:59,562 --> 00:05:02,229
The greatest musician of all time.

83
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,358
Right here in this very plaza,

84
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,893
Ernesto de la Cruz took his first steps...

85
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:11,709
toward becoming the most beloved singer in Méxican history.

86
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:16,148
He started out a total nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me.

87
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,863
But when he played music,

88
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:21,247
he made people fall in love with him.

89
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,907
He starred in movies.

90
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:26,269
He had the coolest guitar!

91
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,250
He could fly!

92
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:30,938
And he wrote the best songs.

93
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,189
But my all-time favorite, it's...

94
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,068
♪ Remember me ♪

95
00:05:36,923 --> 00:05:38,654
♪ Though I have to say goodbye ♪

96
00:05:38,656 --> 00:05:40,178

102
00:05:49,493 --> 00:05:50,989

103
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:53,118

107
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,620
♪ Until you're in my arms again ♪

108
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,086
He lived the kind of life you dream about.

109
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,965
Until 1942.

110
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:19,105
When he was crushed by a giant bell.

111
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:22,252
I want to be just like him.

112
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,670
Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz

113
00:06:30,854 --> 00:06:32,480
and I get this feeling

114
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,666
like we're connected somehow.

115
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:36,944
Like if he could play music,

116
00:06:37,517 --> 00:06:39,655
maybe someday, I could too.

117
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,493
If it wasn't for my family.

118
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:44,834
Ay-ay-ay, muchacho.

119
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,405
I asked for a shoe shine not your life story.

120
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,829
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

121
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,667
I just can't really talk about any of this at home. So...

122
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,011
Look if I were you,

123
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,939
I'd march right up to my family and say...

124
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:58,590
Hey, I'm a musician. Deal with it.

125
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,158
I could never say that.

126
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,068
You are a musician, no?

127
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:03,177
I don't know.

128
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:06,049
I mean, I only really play for myself.

129
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,038
Did de la Cruz become the world's best musician by hiding his skills?

130
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,049
No!

131
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:14,138
He walked out onto that plaza

132
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,142
and he played out loud.

133
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:18,361
Mira, mira, they're setting up for tonight!

134
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,098
The music competition for Día de Muertos.

135
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,716
You want to be like your hero?

136
00:07:22,718 --> 00:07:23,811
You should sign up!

137
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:26,177
My family would freak!

138
00:07:26,624 --> 00:07:28,790
Look, if you're too scared then, well...

139
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:30,282
have fun making shoes.

140
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:33,731
Come on, what did de la Cruz always say?

141
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,917
Seize your moment?

142
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,053
Show me what you got, muchacho.

143
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,136
I'll be your first audience.

144
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,394
Miguel!

145
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:54,750
Abuelita! What are you doing here?

146
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,020
You leave my grandson alone.

147
00:07:58,022 --> 00:07:59,123
Dona, please!

148
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,214
I was just getting a shine.

149
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,328
I know your tricks, mariachi.

150
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,413
What did he say to you?

151
00:08:03,415 --> 00:08:04,961
He was just showing me his guitar.

152
00:08:05,587 --> 00:08:06,594
Shame on you.

153
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,302
My grandson is a sweet little

154
00:08:09,304 --> 00:08:12,076
angelito querido cielito. Little darling angel

155
00:08:12,078 --> 00:08:14,920
He wants no part of your music, mariachi.

156
00:08:14,922 --> 00:08:16,424
You keep away from him.

157
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,695
Ay, pobrecito. Oh poor.

158
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,782
Oh, estás bien, mijo. Oh you're fine, millet.

159
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,675
You know better than to be here in this place!

160
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:30,345
You will come home.

161
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:31,357
Now.

162
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,936
How many times have we told you?

163
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:45,279
That plaza is crawling with mariachis.

164
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:46,790
Yes, Tío Berto.

165
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,492
No, no, no, no, no!

166
00:08:48,516 --> 00:08:50,544
Hey, go away, you. Go!

167
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:51,744
It's just Dante.

168
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,813
Never name a street dog.

169
00:08:53,815 --> 00:08:55,286
They'll follow you forever.

170
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,081
Now, go get my shoe.

171
00:09:03,162 --> 00:09:05,960
I found your son in Mariachi Plaza.

172
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,260
Ay, Miguel!

173
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,472
You know how Abuelita feels about the plaza.

174
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,097
I was just shining shoes.

175
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:12,394
A musician's shoes!

176
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,774
But the plaza's where all the foot traffic is.

177
00:09:16,869 --> 00:09:18,784
If Abuelita says no more plaza,

178
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:20,399
then no more plaza.

179
00:09:20,716 --> 00:09:22,691
But what about tonight? What's tonight?

180
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,626
Well, they're having this talent show.

181
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:27,472
And I thought I might...

182
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,274
Sign up? Well...

183
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:30,706
maybe?

184
00:09:31,027 --> 00:09:33,802
You have to have talent to be in a talent show.

185
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:35,006
What are you gonna do?

186
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,162
Shine shoes?

187
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,081
It's Día de los Muertos.

188
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,976
No one's going anywhere.

189
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:41,636
Tonight is about family.

190
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:44,340
Ofrenda room. Vámonos. Offering room. Let's go.

191
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,809
Don't give me that look.

192
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:59,806
Día de los Muertos is the one night of the year

193
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,784
our ancestors can come visit us.

194
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,057
We've put their photos on the ofrenda

195
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:05,977
so their spirits can cross over.

196
00:10:06,212 --> 00:10:07,778
That is very important.

197
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:09,569
If we don't put them up,

198
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:10,674
they can't come.

199
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,467
We made all this food,

200
00:10:12,469 --> 00:10:15,213
set out the things they loved in life, mijo.

201
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,598
All this work to bring the family together.

202
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:21,457
I don't want you sneaking off to who knows where.

203
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,591
Where are you going?

204
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,794
I thought we were done.

205
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,103
Ay, Dios mio. Oh Lord.

206
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:29,798
Being part of this family means being here for this family.

207
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:33,589
I don't want to see you end up like... Like Mamá Coco's Papá?

208
00:10:33,803 --> 00:10:35,489
Never mention that man!

209
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:36,640
He's better off forgotten.

210
00:10:36,642 --> 00:10:37,535
But you're the one who...

211
00:10:38,061 --> 00:10:38,931
I was just...

212
00:10:39,192 --> 00:10:40,206
But... I...

213
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:43,509
Papá? Papá is home?

214
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,530
Mamá,

215
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:46,484
cálmese, cálmese.

216
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,220
Papá is coming home?

217
00:10:48,222 --> 00:10:49,328
No, Mamá.

218
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,687
It's ok. I'm here.

219
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,162
Who are you?

220
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,910
Rest, Mamá.

221
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,554
I'm hard on you because I care, Miguel.

222
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:01,925
Miguel?

223
00:11:02,546 --> 00:11:03,386
Miguel?

224
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:08,401
What are we going to do with that boy?

225
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:11,265
You're right.

226
00:11:11,267 --> 00:11:13,205
That's just what he needs.

227
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:38,528
It's you.

228
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,762
Get in here. Come on, Dante. Hurry up!

229
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,328
You're gonna get me in trouble, boy.

230
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:45,765
Someone could hear me.

231
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,303
I wish someone wanted to hear me.

232
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,860
Other than you.

233
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,095
Perfecto!

234
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,934
I have to sing.

235
00:12:35,118 --> 00:12:36,481
I have to play!

236
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,854
The music it's...

237
00:12:37,856 --> 00:12:39,216
it's not just in me,

238
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:41,131
it is me.

239
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,370
When life gets me down,

240
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:45,875
I play my guitar.

241
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,329
The rest of the world may follow the rules,

242
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:51,790
but I must follow my heart.

243
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,035
You know that feeling,

244
00:12:55,114 --> 00:12:58,504
like there is a song in the air and it's playing just for you?

245
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:05,373
♪ A feeling so close ♪

246
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,554
♪ You could reach out and touch it ♪

247
00:13:10,212 --> 00:13:16,284
♪ I never knew I could want something so much, but it's true ♪

248
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,884
You must have faith, sister.

249
00:13:18,886 --> 00:13:21,340
Oh, but, Padre, he will never listen.

250
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,319
He will listen. To music.

251
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:26,488
♪ Only a song, only a song ♪

252
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,908
♪ Has the power to change a heart ♪

253
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:36,883
Never underestimate the power of music.

254
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,430
But my father,

255
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:44,494
he will never give his permission.

256
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,365
I am done asking permission.

257
00:13:46,422 --> 00:13:49,327
When you see your moment, you mustn't let it pass you by.

258
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:51,152
You must seize it!

259
00:13:51,644 --> 00:13:52,955
Senor de la Cruz,

260
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,386
what did it take for you to seize your moment?

261
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,585
I had to have faith in my dream.

262
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:01,773
No one was going to hand it to me.

263
00:14:01,775 --> 00:14:04,099
It was up to me to reach for that dream.

264
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:05,715
Grab it tight,

265
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:07,764
and make it come true. And make it come true.

266
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,104
No more hiding, Dante.

267
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:15,930
I got to seize my moment!

268
00:14:17,032 --> 00:14:20,155
I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza if it kills me.

269
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:26,725
Día de los Muertos has begun!

270
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,774
No, no, no, no, no.

271
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:30,518
We have to make a clear path.

272
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:33,157
The petals guide our ancestors home.

273
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:35,018
We don't want their spirits to get lost.

274
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,967
We want them to come and enjoy all the food and drinks on the ofrenda.

275
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:41,734
Mamá!

276
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:43,357
Where should we put this table?

277
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,770
In the courtyard, mijos.

278
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,367
You want it down by the kitchen? Sí. Next to the other one.

279
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,257
Get under! Get under!

280
00:14:53,305 --> 00:14:54,104
Miguel?

281
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:54,882
Nothing!

282
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:57,724
Mamá, Papá. I...

283
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,464
Miguel, your Abuelita had the most wonderful idea.

284
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,903
We've all decided.

285
00:15:03,905 --> 00:15:06,775
It's time you joined us in the workshop!

286
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:07,463
What?

287
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:09,095
No more shining shoes.

288
00:15:09,301 --> 00:15:12,064
You'll be making them every day after school.

289
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:15,003
Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to,

290
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:17,696
carrying on the family tradition.

291
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:20,149
And on Día de los Muertos!

292
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:22,879
Your ancestors will be so proud.

293
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:26,507
You'll craft huaraches just like your Tía Victoria.

294
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,183
And wingtips like your Papá Julio.

295
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:31,810
But what if I'm no good at making shoes?

296
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:33,369
Miguel.

297
00:15:33,435 --> 00:15:35,666
You have your family here to guide you.

298
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,955
You are a Rivera.

299
00:15:38,232 --> 00:15:40,575
And a Rivera is...

300
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,708
A shoemaker.

301
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,149
Through and through.

302
00:15:44,231 --> 00:15:45,575
That's my boy!

303
00:15:46,628 --> 00:15:48,465
Berto! Break out the good stuff.

304
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:49,679
I want to make a toast.

305
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,022
Dante!

306
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,388
No, Dante. Stop!

307
00:16:14,127 --> 00:16:15,357
No, no, no, no, no!

308
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:17,222
No.

309
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,531
De la Cruz's guitar?

310
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:32,868
Papá?

311
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,053
Papá?

312
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,222
Mamá Coco,

313
00:16:37,422 --> 00:16:38,722
is your Papá,

314
00:16:38,724 --> 00:16:40,133
Ernesto de la Cruz?

315
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,329
Papá!

316
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:42,721
Papá!

317
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:56,450
Papá! Papá! It's him!

318
00:16:56,568 --> 00:16:58,409
I know who my great-great-grandfather was.

319
00:16:58,411 --> 00:17:00,262
Miguel, get down from there.

320
00:17:00,356 --> 00:17:03,062
Mamá Coco's father was Ernesto de la Cruz!

321
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,580
What are you talking about?

322
00:17:04,582 --> 00:17:06,435
I'm gonna be a musician!

323
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,664
What is all this?

324
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,856
You keep secrets from your own family?

325
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:13,839
It's all that time he spends in the plaza.

326
00:17:13,841 --> 00:17:15,720
Fills his head with crazy fantasies.

327
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:16,928
It's not a fantasy.

328
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,058
That man was Ernesto de la Cruz!

329
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,097
The greatest musician of all time!

330
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,740
We've never known anything about this man!

331
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,070
But whoever he was,

332
00:17:24,072 --> 00:17:26,344
he still abandoned his family.

333
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:27,957
This is no future for my son.

334
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,785
But, Papá, you said my family would guide me.

335
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,175
Well, de la Cruz is my family.

336
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,905
I'm supposed to play music.

337
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:37,234
Never! That man's music was a curse.

338
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:38,973
I will not allow it.

339
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,385
If you would just let... Miguel.

340
00:17:40,452 --> 00:17:42,095
You will listen to your family.

341
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:43,563
No more music.

342
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:46,470
Just listen to me play! End of argument.

343
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,279
You want to end up like that man?

344
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:51,111
Forgotten?

345
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,497
Left off your family's ofrenda?

346
00:17:53,547 --> 00:17:55,848
I don't care if I'm on some stupid ofrenda.

347
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:00,849
No! Mamá!

348
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,632
There. No guitar.

349
00:18:07,935 --> 00:18:09,023
No music.

350
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:13,432
Come.

351
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:16,431
You'll feel better after you eat with your family.

352
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,638
I don't want to be in this family!

353
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,774
Miguel! Miguel!

354
00:18:39,741 --> 00:18:42,385
I want to play in the plaza, like de la Cruz.

355
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,618
Can I still sign up?

356
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:44,805
You got an instrument?

357
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,649
No.

358
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:47,587
But if I can borrow a guitar...

359
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:49,427
Musicians got to bring their own instruments.

360
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,320
You find a guitar, kid.

361
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:52,521
I'll put you on the list.

362
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,511
Excuse me. Can I borrow your guitar?

363
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:58,524
Sorry, muchacho.

364
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,880
You guys have a spare guitar? No.

365
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,544
I need a guitar just for a little bit.

366
00:19:03,546 --> 00:19:05,109
Get out of here, kid.

367
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,551
Great-great-grandfather,

368
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:22,422
what am I supposed to do?

369
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:52,422
Subtitle www.movieddl.me

370
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,257
No, no, no, no. Dante, stop!

371
00:20:02,378 --> 00:20:03,264
Cállate! Shut!

372
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:26,933
I'm sorry.

373
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,987
Senor de la Cruz,

374
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:07,342
please don't be mad.

375
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:08,838
I'm Miguel.

376
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:10,844
Your great-great grandson.

377
00:21:11,632 --> 00:21:13,493
I need to borrow this.

378
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,945
Our family thinks music is a curse.

379
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,858
None of them understand,

380
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,537
but I know you would have.

381
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,192
You would have told me to follow my heart.

382
00:21:25,447 --> 00:21:27,090
To seize my moment!

383
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,785
So, if it's alright with you,

384
00:21:31,217 --> 00:21:32,889
I'm gonna play in the plaza.

385
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:33,970
Just like you did!

386
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,991
The guitar! It's gone!

387
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,815
Somebody stole de la Cruz's guitar!

388
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,050
The window's broken. Look!

389
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,280
Alright, who's in there?

390
00:21:55,345 --> 00:21:56,357
I'm sorry.

391
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:58,843
It's not what it looks like. De la Cruz is my...

392
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:01,964
Nobody here.

393
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,049
Miguel! Mamá!

394
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,980
Miguel, come home.

395
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:24,102
Where are you, Miguel?

396
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,127
¡Dios mio! My god!

397
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,224
Little boy. Are you ok?

398
00:22:30,472 --> 00:22:31,932
Here. Let me help you.

399
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,450
Thanks. I...

400
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,419
Do you mind?

401
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,599
Look how big she's getting.

402
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,269
Dante!

403
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,087
You can see me?

404
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:19,892
Wait! What's going on?

405
00:23:20,845 --> 00:23:22,510
Dante! Dante!

406
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:25,290
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

407
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,095
Miguel?

408
00:23:26,122 --> 00:23:27,446
Miguel? Miguel?

409
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,381
You're here?

410
00:23:32,718 --> 00:23:34,790
Here, here. And you can see us?

411
00:23:34,792 --> 00:23:37,365
Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to!

412
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:38,881
Remind me how I know you.

413
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,003
We're your family, mijo.

414
00:23:43,143 --> 00:23:44,662
Tía Rosita?

415
00:23:44,997 --> 00:23:45,775
Sí.

416
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:48,891
Papá Julio?

417
00:23:48,893 --> 00:23:49,680
Hola.

418
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:52,380
Tía Victoria?

419
00:23:52,492 --> 00:23:54,671
He doesn't seem entirely dead.

420
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,361
He's not quite alive either.

421
00:23:57,363 --> 00:23:58,736
We need Mamá Imelda.

422
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:00,233
She'll know how to fix this.

423
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:01,138
Oye!

424
00:24:02,557 --> 00:24:04,067
It's Mamá Imelda.

425
00:24:04,115 --> 00:24:05,541
She couldn't cross over.

426
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:08,085
She's stuck! On the other side!

427
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,227
Tío Oscar?

428
00:24:09,758 --> 00:24:10,784
Tío Felipe?

429
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,845
Oh. Hey, Miguel.

430
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,447
I have a feeling this has something to do with you.

431
00:24:15,449 --> 00:24:17,622
But if Mamá Imelda can't come to us...

432
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:18,985
Then we are going to her.

433
00:24:19,201 --> 00:24:20,011
Vámonos! Let's go!

434
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,352
Come on, Miguel.

435
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:37,507
It's ok.

436
00:24:50,763 --> 00:24:51,513
Dante?

437
00:24:51,872 --> 00:24:52,628
Dante!

438
00:24:53,931 --> 00:24:55,092
Dante, wait up!

439
00:24:57,735 --> 00:24:59,354
You got to stay with me, boy.

440
00:24:59,474 --> 00:25:00,790
We don't know...

441
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:02,697
where...

442
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,322
This isn't a dream then.

443
00:25:24,646 --> 00:25:26,333
You're all really out there.

444
00:25:26,335 --> 00:25:28,296
You thought we weren't? Well, I don't know.

445
00:25:28,635 --> 00:25:29,643
I thought it might've been,

446
00:25:29,645 --> 00:25:32,027
one of those made up things that adults tell kids.

447
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:33,391
Like vitamins.

448
00:25:33,493 --> 00:25:35,782
Miguel, vitamins are a real thing.

449
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,377
Well, now I'm thinking maybe they could be.

450
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,152
Mija, it's not nice to stare at...

451
00:25:40,154 --> 00:25:41,383
Ay! Santa Maria!

452
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:50,827
Are those...

453
00:25:51,178 --> 00:25:52,322
Alebrijes!

454
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:53,717
But those are...

455
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,940
Real Alebrijes.

456
00:25:54,942 --> 00:25:56,227
Spirit creatures.

457
00:25:56,278 --> 00:25:58,145
They guide souls on their journey.

458
00:25:58,147 --> 00:26:00,349
Watch your step. They make caquitas everywhere.

459
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:02,742
Welcome back to the Land of the Dead.

460
00:26:02,744 --> 00:26:05,483
Please have all offerings ready for re-entry.

461
00:26:05,485 --> 00:26:07,819
Welcome back. Anything to declare?

462
00:26:07,827 --> 00:26:09,322
Some churros. From my family.

463
00:26:09,324 --> 00:26:11,167
How wonderful. Next.

464
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:13,351
If you are experiencing travel issues,

465
00:26:13,353 --> 00:26:15,697
agents at the Department of Family Reunions

466
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,245
are available to assist you.

467
00:26:17,324 --> 00:26:18,821
Next family, please.

468
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,448
Your photos are on your son's ofrenda.

469
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,502
Have a great visit.

470
00:26:26,588 --> 00:26:27,456
Gracias.

471
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,983
And remember to return before sunrise.

472
00:26:29,985 --> 00:26:30,859
Enjoy your visit.

473
00:26:30,861 --> 00:26:31,683
Next.

474
00:26:33,334 --> 00:26:35,448
Your photo's on your dentist's ofrenda.

475
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,745
Enjoy your visit.

476
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,355
Gracias. Next?

477
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,102
Yes! It is I. Frida Kahlo.

478
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:44,587
Shall we skip the scanner?

479
00:26:44,684 --> 00:26:48,302
I'm on so many ofrendas it'll just overwhelm your blinky thingy.

480
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,096
Well shoot,

481
00:26:51,356 --> 00:26:53,205
looks like no one put up your photo,

482
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:54,519
Frida.

483
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,431
Ok, when I said I was Frida,

484
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:57,162
just now,

485
00:26:57,302 --> 00:26:58,956
that... was a lie.

486
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,578
And I apologize for doing that.

487
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,206
No photo on an ofrenda, no crossing the bridge.

488
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:05,638
You know what, I'm just gonna zip right over.

489
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,043
You won't even know I'm gone.

490
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,340
Hey!

491
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:16,701
Almost...

492
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:17,390
there.

493
00:27:17,462 --> 00:27:19,462
Just a little further.

494
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,523
Upsy-daisy...

495
00:27:25,572 --> 00:27:27,855
Fine. Ok. Fine, who cares?

496
00:27:27,882 --> 00:27:29,549
Dumb flower bridge!

497
00:27:30,668 --> 00:27:33,721
I don't know what I'd do if no one put up my photo.

498
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:34,417
Next?

499
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,050
Come, mijo. It's our turn.

500
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,703
Welcome back, amigos.

501
00:27:37,705 --> 00:27:39,018
Anything to declare?

502
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,543
As a matter of fact, yes.

503
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:43,553
Hola.

504
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:55,720
Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos. Please report to Level Seven.

505
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,023
I miss my nose.

506
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,291
Come on, help us out, amigo.

507
00:28:18,293 --> 00:28:20,240
We got to get to a dozen ofrendas tonight.

508
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:23,746
We are not visiting your ex-wife's family for Día de Muertos!

509
00:28:24,028 --> 00:28:26,500
I demand to speak to the person in charge!

510
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,540
I'm sorry señora, it says here no one put up your photo.

511
00:28:29,614 --> 00:28:33,960
My family always, always puts my photo on the ofrenda.

512
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,932
That devil box tells you nothing but lies!

513
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,468
Mamá Imelda?

514
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:41,642
Oh, mi familia!

515
00:28:41,672 --> 00:28:43,403
They would not let me cross the bridge.

516
00:28:43,586 --> 00:28:45,834
Tell this woman and her devil box,

517
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:48,445
that my photo is on the ofrenda.

518
00:28:48,502 --> 00:28:51,777
Well, we never made it to the ofrenda.

519
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,843
What? We ran into...

520
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,768
Miguel?

521
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,370
Mamá Imelda.

522
00:29:01,984 --> 00:29:04,157
What is going on?

523
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,223
You the Rivera family?

524
00:29:08,537 --> 00:29:09,765
Well, you're cursed.

525
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:10,731
What?

526
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,335
Día de los Muertos is the night to give to the dead.

527
00:29:13,337 --> 00:29:14,751
You stole from the dead!

528
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,343
But I wasn't stealing the guitar. Guitar?

529
00:29:17,345 --> 00:29:18,848
It was my great-great-grandfather's.

530
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,438
He would have wanted me to have it.

531
00:29:20,812 --> 00:29:23,260
We do not speak of that musician.

532
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:25,136
He is dead to this family.

533
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:27,160
You're all dead.

534
00:29:28,468 --> 00:29:29,337
I am sorry.

535
00:29:29,474 --> 00:29:30,732
Whose Alebrije is that?

536
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:31,938
That's just Dante.

537
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,121
He sure doesn't look like an Alebrije.

538
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,750
He just looks like a plain old dog.

539
00:29:35,752 --> 00:29:38,014
Or a sausage someone dropped in a barbershop.

540
00:29:38,147 --> 00:29:39,375
Whatever he is, I am...

541
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:41,775
terribly allergic.

542
00:29:41,982 --> 00:29:43,530
But Dante doesn't have any hair.

543
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:44,973
And I don't have a nose,

544
00:29:44,975 --> 00:29:46,187
and yet here we are.

545
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:51,126
But none of this explains why I couldn't cross over.

546
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,965
You took my photo off the ofrenda?

547
00:29:56,967 --> 00:29:59,140
It was an accident! How do we send him back?

548
00:29:59,185 --> 00:29:59,767
Well,

549
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,840
since it's a family matter...

550
00:30:01,889 --> 00:30:06,105
the way to undo a family curse is to get your family's blessing.

551
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:06,826
That's it?

552
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:10,979
Get your family's blessing and everything should go back to normal.

553
00:30:11,236 --> 00:30:13,094
But you got to do it by sunrise.

554
00:30:13,165 --> 00:30:14,769
What happens at sunrise?

555
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,739
Híjole! Your hand!

556
00:30:22,752 --> 00:30:24,812
Miguel, can't have you fainting on us.

557
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:26,776
But not to worry.

558
00:30:26,778 --> 00:30:27,888
Your family's here.

559
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,539
You can get your blessing right now.

560
00:30:29,713 --> 00:30:31,956
Cempasúchil, cempasúchil. Marigold flower's Mexican name

561
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,506
Perdón, señora. Excuse me lady.

562
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:38,257
Now, you look at the living and say his name.

563
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,059
Miguel.

564
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:40,962
Nailed it.

565
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,638
Now say, I give you my blessing.

566
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,357
I give you my blessing.

567
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,886
I give you my blessing to go home...

568
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,702
to put my photo back on the ofrenda,

569
00:30:55,113 --> 00:30:56,939
and to never play music again.

570
00:30:56,995 --> 00:30:58,897
What? She can't do that!

571
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:02,092
Well technically, she can add any condition she wants.

572
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,232
Fine.

573
00:31:04,234 --> 00:31:06,503
Then you hand the petal to Miguel.

574
00:31:19,084 --> 00:31:20,186
No skeletons!

575
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,683
Mariachi Plaza, here I come.

576
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,186
Two seconds and you already break your promise.

577
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,109
This isn't fair. It's my life.

578
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:36,556
You already had yours.

579
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:39,245
Papá Julio, I ask for your blessing.

580
00:31:40,062 --> 00:31:41,166
Tía Rosita?

581
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:42,440
Oscar?

582
00:31:42,657 --> 00:31:43,396
Felipe?

583
00:31:43,689 --> 00:31:44,701
Tía Victoria?

584
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,782
Don't make this hard, mijo.

585
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:49,541
You go home my way or no way.

586
00:31:49,589 --> 00:31:51,348
You really hate music that much?

587
00:31:51,364 --> 00:31:54,294
I will not let you go down the same path he did.

588
00:31:57,152 --> 00:31:59,030
The same path he did.

589
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,263
He's family.

590
00:32:01,303 --> 00:32:04,198
Listen to your Mamá Imelda. She's just looking out for you.

591
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,189
Be reasonable.

592
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:06,294
Con permiso, With your permission,

593
00:32:06,296 --> 00:32:08,260
I need to visit the restroom.

594
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:10,345
Be right back.

595
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,564
Should we tell him there are no restrooms in the Land of the Dead?

596
00:32:27,776 --> 00:32:28,822
Vámonos. Let's go!

597
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,558
We got a family looking for a living boy.

598
00:32:31,598 --> 00:32:34,209
If I want to be a musician, I need a musician's blessing.

599
00:32:34,307 --> 00:32:36,184
We got to find my great-great-grandpa.

600
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,547
Hold it, muchacho. Hold it, kid.

601
00:32:41,846 --> 00:32:43,194
I found that living boy!

602
00:32:43,604 --> 00:32:45,628
Excuse me. Excuse me, folks.

603
00:32:45,693 --> 00:32:46,885
Excuse me.

604
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,481
No, no. Dante!

605
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,633
Disturbing the peace.

606
00:32:56,635 --> 00:32:58,289
Fleeing an officer.

607
00:32:58,291 --> 00:33:00,059
Falsifying a unibrow.

608
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,362
That's illegal? Very illegal.

609
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,400
You need to clean up your act, amigo.

610
00:33:04,726 --> 00:33:05,657
Amigo? Friend?

611
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:08,674
That's so nice to hear you say that because...

612
00:33:09,139 --> 00:33:11,677
I have just had a really hard Día de Muertos

613
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,886
and I could really use an amigo right now.

614
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,257
And amigos,

615
00:33:15,364 --> 00:33:16,603
they help their amigos.

616
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,484
Listen, you get me across that bridge tonight,

617
00:33:19,492 --> 00:33:20,881
and I'll make it worth your while.

618
00:33:21,554 --> 00:33:23,942
You like de la Cruz? He and I go way back.

619
00:33:24,093 --> 00:33:27,427
I can get you front row seats to his Sunrise Spectacular show.

620
00:33:27,436 --> 00:33:29,669
I'll get you backstage. You can meet him.

621
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,360
You just got to let me cross that bridge!

622
00:33:31,362 --> 00:33:33,651
I should lock you up for the rest of the holiday.

623
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,644
But my shift's almost up and I want to visit my living family.

624
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,035
So I'm letting you off with a warning.

625
00:33:41,634 --> 00:33:43,395
Can I at least get my costume back?

626
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,110
No.

627
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,334
Some amigo.

628
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,118
Hey! Hey!

629
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:53,780
You really know de la Cruz?

630
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:54,581
Who wants to...

631
00:33:54,996 --> 00:33:56,400
Ay! You're alive!

632
00:33:56,905 --> 00:33:58,067
Yeah, I'm alive.

633
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,217
And if I want to get back to the Land of the Living.

634
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:01,526
I need de la Cruz's blessing.

635
00:34:01,528 --> 00:34:02,960
That's weirdly specific.

636
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:04,835
He's my great-great-grandfather.

637
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:06,966
He's your Gr... Gr... Wha... What?

638
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:11,081
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

639
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:12,446
Wait, wait.

640
00:34:14,113 --> 00:34:15,770
Wait. No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

641
00:34:15,772 --> 00:34:16,969
Wait. Wait, wait, wait,

642
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,227
Wait, wait.

643
00:34:18,482 --> 00:34:20,598
Yes you're going back to the Land of the Living!

644
00:34:20,861 --> 00:34:22,438
You know what? Maybe this isn't such a good...

645
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,668
No, no, nino, nino, nino.

646
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,222
I can help you. You can help me.

647
00:34:25,224 --> 00:34:26,356
We can help each other.

648
00:34:26,454 --> 00:34:28,270
But most importantly, you can help me.

649
00:34:28,272 --> 00:34:29,899
Miguel! I'm Héctor.

650
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,777
That's nice.

651
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,371
Espérame, chamaco! Wait for me, kid!

652
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,995
Ay, he is going to get himself killed.

653
00:34:47,997 --> 00:34:49,663
I need my spirit guide.

654
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:50,978
Pepita.

655
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,316
Who has that petal Miguel touched?

656
00:35:05,366 --> 00:35:08,528
Here. Nice Alebrije.

657
00:35:21,438 --> 00:35:22,987
Ay, ay, hold still.

658
00:35:23,172 --> 00:35:24,226
Look up. Look up a ver, Look up let's see,

659
00:35:24,228 --> 00:35:25,836
A ver. Look up, up, up.

660
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,652
Aqui arriba, eso... Up here, that...

661
00:35:31,201 --> 00:35:32,424
La rayita. The hairline.

662
00:35:32,457 --> 00:35:33,046
Ok.

663
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,885
Hey! Ta-da!

664
00:35:36,105 --> 00:35:37,482
Dead as a doorknob.

665
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,635
So listen Miguel,

666
00:35:39,803 --> 00:35:41,499
this place runs on memories.

667
00:35:41,741 --> 00:35:42,938
When you're well remembered,

668
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,215
people put up your photo

669
00:35:44,217 --> 00:35:45,423
and you get to cross the bridge

670
00:35:45,425 --> 00:35:47,516
and visit the living on Día de Muertos.

671
00:35:47,793 --> 00:35:48,912
Unless you're me.

672
00:35:49,094 --> 00:35:50,521
You don't get to cross over?

673
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,012
No one's ever put up my picture.

674
00:35:52,014 --> 00:35:53,505
But you can change that!

675
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,674
This is you?

676
00:35:55,734 --> 00:35:57,111
Muy guapo? Very handsome?

677
00:35:57,342 --> 00:36:00,384
So, you get me to my great-great-grandpa...

678
00:36:00,503 --> 00:36:02,960
then I put up your photo when I get home?

679
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,503
Such a smart boy!

680
00:36:04,505 --> 00:36:06,349
Yes! Great idea, yes!

681
00:36:06,351 --> 00:36:07,046
One hiccup.

682
00:36:07,149 --> 00:36:09,045
De la Cruz is a tough guy to get to

683
00:36:09,047 --> 00:36:10,644
and I need to cross the bridge soon.

684
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:11,799
Like tonight.

685
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:13,466
So, you got any other family here, you know?

686
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,861
Someone a bit more accessible?

687
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,465
Nope.

688
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:18,994
Don't yank my chain, chamaco.

689
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:20,537
You got to have some other family.

690
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:21,823
Only de la Cruz.

691
00:36:21,825 --> 00:36:24,131
If you can't help me, I'll find him myself.

692
00:36:25,963 --> 00:36:27,561
Ok. Ok, kid. Fine!

693
00:36:27,563 --> 00:36:29,338
Fine! I'll get you to your great-great-grandpa.

694
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,834
It's not gonna be easy, you know?

695
00:36:32,836 --> 00:36:34,407
You know he's a, he's a busy man.

696
00:36:35,065 --> 00:36:36,098
What are you doing?

697
00:36:36,145 --> 00:36:38,541
I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in.

698
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:40,440
No. Skeletons don't walk like that.

699
00:36:40,442 --> 00:36:42,481
It's how you walk. No, I don't!

700
00:36:43,303 --> 00:36:44,040
Stop it!

701
00:36:45,649 --> 00:36:48,736
Ernesto de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular?

702
00:36:48,738 --> 00:36:49,689
¡Qué padre! That's great!

703
00:36:50,197 --> 00:36:53,217
Every year your great-great-grandpa puts on that dumb show,

704
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:54,825
to mark the end of Día de Muertos.

705
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,599
And you can get us in!

706
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,504
Hey, you said you have front row tickets!

707
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,332
That...

708
00:37:00,334 --> 00:37:01,241
was a lie.

709
00:37:01,243 --> 00:37:02,435
I apologize for that.

710
00:37:03,114 --> 00:37:05,247
Cool off, chamaco. Come on. I'll get you to him.

711
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:05,928
How?

712
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:08,068
Because I happen to know where he's rehearsing.

713
00:37:24,117 --> 00:37:26,490
You better have my dress, Héctor.

714
00:37:26,492 --> 00:37:27,584
Hola, Cezi.

715
00:37:33,912 --> 00:37:34,602
Hola.

716
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:38,046
Cezi, I lost the dress.

717
00:37:38,129 --> 00:37:39,499
Ay, diosa Mia! Oh my God!

718
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,115
I got to dress forty dancers by sunrise. Cezi, Cezi. I'm sorry.

719
00:37:42,184 --> 00:37:43,238
And thanks to you. Cezi.

720
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,356
I'm one Frida short of an opening number!

721
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,056
Dante!

722
00:37:48,525 --> 00:37:49,928
We should not be in here.

723
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,965
No, no, Dante!

724
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:06,873
Ven acá! Come here!

725
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:16,778
You!

726
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,758
How did you get in here?

727
00:38:18,187 --> 00:38:19,974
I just followed my...

728
00:38:20,642 --> 00:38:22,131
The mighty Xolo dog!

729
00:38:22,372 --> 00:38:24,727
Guider of wandering spirits.

730
00:38:25,086 --> 00:38:28,252
And whose spirit have you guided to me?

731
00:38:28,276 --> 00:38:30,617
I don't think he's a spirit guide.

732
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:34,386
The Alebrijes of this world can take many forms.

733
00:38:34,503 --> 00:38:37,365
They are as mysterious as they are powerful.

734
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:45,392
Or maybe he's just a dog.

735
00:38:45,394 --> 00:38:47,411
Come, I need your eyes.

736
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:49,969
You are the audience.

737
00:38:51,336 --> 00:38:52,370
Darkness.

738
00:38:52,966 --> 00:38:54,590
And from the darkness,

739
00:38:54,814 --> 00:38:56,694
a giant Papáya.

740
00:38:58,132 --> 00:39:00,446
Dancers emerge from the Papáya,

741
00:39:00,912 --> 00:39:03,488
and the dancers are all me.

742
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:07,824
And they go to drink from the milk of their mother,

743
00:39:07,969 --> 00:39:08,800
who is a cactus.

744
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,359
But who is also me.

745
00:39:10,471 --> 00:39:12,873
And her milk is not milk...

746
00:39:13,335 --> 00:39:14,945
but tears.

747
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:17,179
Is it too obvious?

748
00:39:17,465 --> 00:39:20,679
I think it's just the right amount of obvious?

749
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,637
It could use some music.

750
00:39:23,383 --> 00:39:24,291
What if you did like...

751
00:39:28,051 --> 00:39:29,151
And then it could go...

752
00:39:34,383 --> 00:39:36,902
And what if everything was on fire?

753
00:39:37,522 --> 00:39:39,570
Yes! Fire! Everywhere!

754
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:40,983
Inspired!

755
00:39:41,024 --> 00:39:43,802
You have the spirit of an artist.

756
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:48,429
The dancers exit. The music fades, the lights go out.

757
00:39:49,046 --> 00:39:52,266
And Ernesto de la Cruz rises to the stage!

758
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,302
He does a couple of songs, the sun rises, everyone cheers...

759
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,972
Excuse me, where's the real de la Cruz?

760
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,073
Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals!

761
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:07,745
He's too busy hosting that fancy party at the top of his tower.

762
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,735
Chamaco, you can't run off on me like that.

763
00:40:13,737 --> 00:40:15,516
Come on stop pestering the celebrities.

764
00:40:15,518 --> 00:40:17,612
You said my great-great-grandpa would be here!

765
00:40:17,723 --> 00:40:20,413
He's halfway across town throwing some big party.

766
00:40:20,415 --> 00:40:21,363
That bum.

767
00:40:21,365 --> 00:40:22,963
Who doesn't show up to his own rehearsal?

768
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:25,888
If you're such good friends, how come he didn't invite you?

769
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,801
He's your great-great-grandpa, how come he didn't invite you?

770
00:40:29,151 --> 00:40:30,143
Hey, Gustavo!

771
00:40:30,145 --> 00:40:31,681
You know anything about this party?

772
00:40:31,683 --> 00:40:33,286
It's the hot ticket!

773
00:40:33,366 --> 00:40:36,093
But if you're not on the guest list, you're never getting in,

774
00:40:36,095 --> 00:40:37,703
Chorizo. Hey!

775
00:40:37,705 --> 00:40:39,657
It's Chorizo! Choricito!

776
00:40:40,631 --> 00:40:42,895
Very funny, guys. Very funny. Chorizo?

777
00:40:43,756 --> 00:40:45,079
This guy's famous!

778
00:40:45,103 --> 00:40:47,176
Go on, go on. Ask him how he died.

779
00:40:47,226 --> 00:40:48,934
I don't want to talk about it.

780
00:40:48,936 --> 00:40:51,587
He choked on some chorizo!

781
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:57,730
I didn't choke, ok? I got food poisoning which is a big difference.

782
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,407
This is why I don't like musicians.

783
00:41:00,409 --> 00:41:02,166
Bunch of self-important jerks.

784
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,976
Hey! I'm a musician!

785
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,305
You are? Well...

786
00:41:05,307 --> 00:41:07,490
If you really want to get to Ernesto,

787
00:41:07,492 --> 00:41:10,374
there is that music competition at the Plaza de la Cruz.

788
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:13,104
Winner gets to play at his party.

789
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,499
No, no, Chamaco.

790
00:41:15,678 --> 00:41:17,178
You're loco if you think...

791
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,498
I need to get my great-great-grandfather's blessing!

792
00:41:19,843 --> 00:41:21,394
You know where I can get a guitar?

793
00:41:23,627 --> 00:41:25,066
I know a guy.

794
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,439
Have you found him, Pepita?

795
00:41:38,441 --> 00:41:39,878
Have you found our boy?

796
00:41:41,246 --> 00:41:43,760
A footprint! It's a Rivera boot.

797
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:45,751
Size seven! And a half.

798
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,836
Pronated. Miguel.

799
00:41:57,475 --> 00:41:59,558
Why the heck would you want to be a musician?

800
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,535
My great-great-grandpa was a musician!

801
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:04,827
Who spent his life performing like a monkey for complete strangers.

802
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,165
No thank you. No! Guácala! No thank you. No, yuck!

803
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:08,119
What do you know?

804
00:42:09,164 --> 00:42:11,415
So, how far is this guitar anyway?

805
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:12,504
We're almost there.

806
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,003
Keep up, chamaco. Come on.

807
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,058
Cousin Héctor! Hey!

808
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,719
These guys! Hey, Tío!

809
00:42:31,721 --> 00:42:33,425
Hey, Tío! ¿Qué onda? Hey uncle! What's up?

810
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:35,534
These people are all your family?

811
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,544
In a way.

812
00:42:37,546 --> 00:42:39,901
We're all the ones with no photos or ofrendas.

813
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,595
No family to go home to.

814
00:42:41,597 --> 00:42:42,992
Nearly forgotten, you know?

815
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,191
So, we all call each other cousin,

816
00:42:45,193 --> 00:42:47,241
or tío, or whatever.

817
00:42:52,415 --> 00:42:54,074
Héctor! Tía Chelo!

818
00:42:56,147 --> 00:42:57,833
Muchas gracias! Thank you very much!

819
00:42:57,835 --> 00:42:59,220
Hey! Save some for me!

820
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:00,517
Is Chicharrón around?

821
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,791
In the bungalow.

822
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:04,569
I don't know if he's in the mood for visitors.

823
00:43:05,187 --> 00:43:07,664
Who doesn't like a visit from Cousin Héctor?

824
00:43:16,953 --> 00:43:18,626
Buenas noches, Chicharrón! Good evening, Chicharron!

825
00:43:18,628 --> 00:43:21,262
I don't want to see your stupid face, Héctor.

826
00:43:21,264 --> 00:43:23,279
Come on. It's Día de Muertos.

827
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:24,832
I brought you a little offering.

828
00:43:24,834 --> 00:43:26,806
Get out of here. I would, Cheech.

829
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,527
But the thing is, me and my friend, Miguel...

830
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,239
We really need to borrow your guitar.

831
00:43:32,483 --> 00:43:33,926
My guitar? Yes.

832
00:43:33,928 --> 00:43:36,265
My prized beloved guitar?

833
00:43:36,267 --> 00:43:37,896
I promise we'll bring it right back.

834
00:43:37,898 --> 00:43:40,649
Like the time you promised to bring back my van?

835
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:42,113
Or my mini-fridge?

836
00:43:42,548 --> 00:43:43,867
You see... Or my good napkins?

837
00:43:44,006 --> 00:43:45,633
My lasso? My femur?

838
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:47,030
Well, no, not like those times.

839
00:43:47,032 --> 00:43:48,555
Where is my femur? You...

840
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,804
You ok, amigo?

841
00:43:53,551 --> 00:43:55,383
I'm fading, Héctor.

842
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,302
I can feel it.

843
00:43:58,248 --> 00:44:01,366
I couldn't even play that thing if I wanted to.

844
00:44:04,622 --> 00:44:07,146
You play me something.

845
00:44:07,163 --> 00:44:09,542
No. You know I don't play anymore, Cheech.

846
00:44:09,544 --> 00:44:10,839
The guitar is for the kid.

847
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,575
You want it,

848
00:44:12,854 --> 00:44:14,847
you got to earn it.

849
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:19,189
Ay, only for you, amigo.

850
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,085
Any requests?

851
00:44:24,864 --> 00:44:27,151
You know my favorite, Héctor.

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,152

853

♪ Knuckles they drag on the floor ♪

857
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:09,496

862
00:45:37,714 --> 00:45:39,500
Brings back memories.

863
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,827
Gracias. Thank you.

864
00:46:17,161 --> 00:46:18,913
Wait. What happened?

865
00:46:19,604 --> 00:46:20,981
He's been forgotten.

866
00:46:21,607 --> 00:46:24,326
When there is no one left in the living world who remembers you...

867
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,405
you disappear from this world.

868
00:46:27,222 --> 00:46:29,620
We call it the final death.

869
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,244
Where did he go?

870
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:33,720
No one knows.

871
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:35,204
But I've met him.

872
00:46:35,206 --> 00:46:37,509
I could remember him when I go back!

873
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,412
No, it doesn't work like that, chamaco.

874
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,520
Our memories,

875
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:44,882
they have to be passed down by those who knew us in life...

876
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:47,562
in the stories they tell about us.

877
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:51,294
But there is no one left alive to pass down Cheech's stories.

878
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,825
Hey, it happens to everyone eventually.

879
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:57,446
Come on de la Cruzcito,

880
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:58,996
you've got a contest to win.

881
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,389
You told me you hated musicians.

882
00:47:13,391 --> 00:47:14,875
You never said you were one.

883
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:16,905
How do you think I knew your great-great-grandpa?

884
00:47:16,994 --> 00:47:18,478
We used to play music together.

885
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,783
Taught him everything he knows.

886
00:47:20,214 --> 00:47:21,604
No manches!

887
00:47:21,606 --> 00:47:23,514
You played with Ernesto de la Cruz.

888
00:47:23,523 --> 00:47:25,241
The greatest musician of all time?

889
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:27,351
You're funny.

890
00:47:27,353 --> 00:47:29,934
Greatest eyebrows of all time maybe, but his music?

891
00:47:30,094 --> 00:47:31,307
Hey not so much.

892
00:47:31,326 --> 00:47:33,077
You don't know what you're talking about.

893
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:38,091
Welcome to the Plaza de la Cruz!

894
00:47:39,138 --> 00:47:40,856
Showtime, chamaco!

895
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:49,663
Llévelo! T-shirts! Bobbleheads!

896
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:59,719
Bienvenidos a todos! Welcome everybody!

897
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:05,300
Who's ready for some música?

898
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,762
It's a battle of the bands, amigos.

899
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,865
The winner gets to play for the maestro himself,

900
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:14,045
Ernesto de la Cruz,

901
00:48:14,047 --> 00:48:16,391
at his fiesta tonight!

902
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,608
That's our ticket, muchacho.

903
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:24,398
Let the competition begin!

904
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,905
So, what's the plan? What are you gonna play?

905
00:48:42,062 --> 00:48:43,255
Definitely Remember Me.

906
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,363
No! Not that one. No. Come on.

907
00:48:45,365 --> 00:48:46,930
It's his most popular song!

908
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:48,133
It's too popular.

909
00:48:48,135 --> 00:48:50,058
♪ Remember me ♪ ♪ Though I have to travel far ♪

910
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:53,944
♪ Remember me ♪ ♪ Don't let it make you cry ♪

911
00:48:58,092 --> 00:48:59,422
What about Poco Loco?

912
00:48:59,424 --> 00:49:01,475
Epa! Now that's a song!

913
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:02,543
De la Cruzcito?

914
00:49:02,545 --> 00:49:03,514
You're on standby.

915
00:49:03,516 --> 00:49:05,217
Los Chachalacos, you're up next.

916
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,567
Los Chachalacos!

917
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,800
You always this nervous before a performance?

918
00:49:21,802 --> 00:49:22,736
I don't know.

919
00:49:22,738 --> 00:49:24,977
I've never performed before.

920
00:49:24,979 --> 00:49:26,943
What? You said you were a musician!

921
00:49:26,945 --> 00:49:28,881
I am! I mean, I will be.

922
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,284
Ay! Once I win.

923
00:49:30,286 --> 00:49:31,528
That's your plan?

924
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:33,210
No, no, no, no. You have to win, Miguel.

925
00:49:33,212 --> 00:49:35,160
Your life literally depends on you winning.

926
00:49:35,162 --> 00:49:36,721
And you've never done this before!

927
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:37,890
I'll go up there. No!

928
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,645
I need to do this. Why?

929
00:49:39,946 --> 00:49:42,065
If I can't go out and play one song,

930
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,862
how can I call myself a musician?

931
00:49:43,879 --> 00:49:44,905
What does that matter?

932
00:49:44,907 --> 00:49:47,304
Because I don't just want to get de la Cruz's blessing...

933
00:49:47,757 --> 00:49:49,355
I need to prove that...

934
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,604
I'm worthy of it.

935
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:54,373
That's such a sweet sentiment,

936
00:49:54,684 --> 00:49:57,009
at such a bad time!

937
00:49:58,849 --> 00:50:00,113
Ok! Ok, ok.

938
00:50:00,115 --> 00:50:03,549
Ok. Ok you want to perform? Then you got to perform!

939
00:50:03,763 --> 00:50:06,429
First, you have to loosen up. Shake off those nerves.

940
00:50:10,709 --> 00:50:12,226
Now give me your best grito.

941
00:50:12,305 --> 00:50:13,463
My best grito?

942
00:50:13,465 --> 00:50:15,018
Come on, yell! Belt it out.

943
00:50:19,395 --> 00:50:21,546
It feels good. Ok, now, now you.

944
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,559
Come on, kid.

945
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,150
De la Cruzcito, you're on now!

946
00:50:41,152 --> 00:50:43,660
Miguel, look at me. Hey, hey look at me.

947
00:50:43,662 --> 00:50:44,908
Come on, let's go! You can do this.

948
00:50:45,274 --> 00:50:47,155
Grab their attention and don't let it go.

949
00:50:47,314 --> 00:50:49,544
Make them listen, chamaco. You've got this.

950
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,758
De la Cruzcito!

951
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:54,867
Arriba-Ba! Hey!

952
00:51:00,767 --> 00:51:02,770
What's he doing? Why isn't he playing?

953
00:51:03,573 --> 00:51:05,647
Bring back the singing dogs!

954
00:51:17,939 --> 00:51:20,186

Hey! Where are you going? We got to get out of here!

982
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,992
What? Are you crazy? We're about to win this thing.

983
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,771
Damas y caballeros. Ladies and gentlemen.

984
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,836
I have an emergency announcement.

985
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:31,219
Please be on the lookout for a living boy.

986
00:53:31,524 --> 00:53:33,379
Answers to the name of Miguel.

987
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,824
Earlier tonight he ran away from his family.

988
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:39,927
They just want to send him back to the Land of the Living.

989
00:53:40,089 --> 00:53:41,033
Wait, wait, wait.

990
00:53:41,243 --> 00:53:43,218
You said de la Cruz was your only family.

991
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,972
The only person who could send you home.

992
00:53:44,974 --> 00:53:46,415
I do have other family but...

993
00:53:46,417 --> 00:53:48,182
You could have taken my photo back this whole time?

994
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:49,447
But they hate music!

995
00:53:49,449 --> 00:53:51,243
I need a musician's blessing.

996
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:53,663
You lied to me! You're one to talk.

997
00:53:53,735 --> 00:53:55,814
Look at me. I'm being forgotten, Miguel.

998
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:57,671
I don't even know if I'm gonna last the night.

999
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:00,152
I'm not gonna miss my one chance to cross that bridge

1000
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:03,397
because you want to live out some stupid musical fantasy.

1001
00:54:03,414 --> 00:54:05,683
It's not stupid! I'm taking you to your family.

1002
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:07,165
Let go of me! You'll thank me later.

1003
00:54:07,167 --> 00:54:09,852
You don't want to help me. You only care about yourself!

1004
00:54:10,494 --> 00:54:12,032
Keep your dumb photo.

1005
00:54:12,034 --> 00:54:13,641
No. No. Stay away from me!

1006
00:54:13,643 --> 00:54:14,543
No!

1007
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,544
Hey, chamaco!

1008
00:54:18,386 --> 00:54:19,506
Where did you go?

1009
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:20,996
Chamaco! Boy!

1010
00:54:21,656 --> 00:54:23,757
I'm sorry! Come back!

1011
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,032
Dante, cállate! Dante, shut up!

1012
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,114
No! Dante, stop it.

1013
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,556
He can't help me.

1014
00:54:41,267 --> 00:54:42,812
Dante! Stop!

1015
00:54:43,155 --> 00:54:44,265
Stop it!

1016
00:54:44,267 --> 00:54:45,466
Leave me alone!

1017
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:48,093
You're not a spirit guide. You're just a dumb dog!

1018
00:54:48,693 --> 00:54:49,940
Now get out of here!

1019
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:50,971
It's him!

1020
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,704
It's that living boy!

1021
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:54,420
I heard about him. Look! He's alive!

1022
00:54:54,507 --> 00:54:55,884
He's alive. The boy is alive!

1023
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,644
This nonsense ends now, Miguel!

1024
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:11,393
I am giving you my blessing and you are going home.

1025
00:55:11,435 --> 00:55:13,061
I don't want your blessing!

1026
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:15,748
Miguel, stop!

1027
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:19,364
Come back!

1028
00:55:21,654 --> 00:55:22,415
Miguel!

1029
00:55:26,796 --> 00:55:28,924
I am trying to save your life!

1030
00:55:28,995 --> 00:55:30,212
You're ruining my life!

1031
00:55:30,447 --> 00:55:31,165
What?

1032
00:55:31,167 --> 00:55:33,088
Music's the only thing that makes me happy.

1033
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:35,961
And you want to take it away.

1034
00:55:36,413 --> 00:55:37,918
You'll never understand.

1035
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:45,847
♪ Y aunque la vida me cueste, Llorona ♪

1036
00:55:46,181 --> 00:55:49,764
♪ No dejaré de quererte ♪

1037
00:55:50,938 --> 00:55:53,142
I thought you hated music.

1038
00:55:54,029 --> 00:55:55,563
I loved it!

1039
00:55:56,555 --> 00:55:58,286
I remember that feeling...

1040
00:55:58,632 --> 00:56:00,733
when my husband would play,

1041
00:56:00,735 --> 00:56:02,128
and I would sing,

1042
00:56:02,515 --> 00:56:05,081
and nothing else mattered.

1043
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,973
But when we had Coco,

1044
00:56:08,261 --> 00:56:10,280
suddenly there was something in my life

1045
00:56:10,282 --> 00:56:13,234
that mattered more than music.

1046
00:56:14,174 --> 00:56:16,537
I wanted to put down roots.

1047
00:56:17,249 --> 00:56:19,923
He wanted to play for the world.

1048
00:56:21,108 --> 00:56:24,473
We each made a sacrifice to get what we wanted.

1049
00:56:25,044 --> 00:56:26,884
Now you must make a choice.

1050
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,804
But I don't want to pick sides!

1051
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:31,969
Why can't you be on my side?

1052
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,428
That's what family's supposed to do.

1053
00:56:34,968 --> 00:56:36,065
Support you.

1054
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:39,673
But you never will.

1055
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,467
Have a good time. Oh, how exciting!

1056
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:03,789
Oh, El Santo.

1057
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:05,740
I'm a big fan!

1058
00:57:06,139 --> 00:57:07,749
You mind if I...

1059
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,101
Gracias, Senor. Thank you, sir.

1060
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,649
Invitation? It's ok.

1061
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,222
I'm Ernesto's great-great-grandson.

1062
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,432
Disculpen, senores. Excuse me, gentlemen.

1063
00:57:34,434 --> 00:57:36,646
Hey, guys! It's poco loco!

1064
00:57:36,648 --> 00:57:39,106
You were on fire tonight! You too!

1065
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:41,199
Hey, musician to musician.

1066
00:57:41,422 --> 00:57:42,769
I need a favor.

1067
00:57:45,702 --> 00:57:47,214
The competition winners.

1068
00:57:47,216 --> 00:57:49,055
Congratulations, chicos.

1069
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:00,898
Thanks, guys!

1070
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,679
Hey! Enjoy the party, little músico!

1071
00:58:15,681 --> 00:58:16,540
Gracias! Thank you!

1072
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:33,601
Look! It's Ernesto!

1073
00:58:35,654 --> 00:58:36,621
De la Cruz!

1074
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,690
Senor de la Cruz!

1075
00:58:41,731 --> 00:58:42,643
Pardon me!

1076
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:45,402
Senor de la Cruz! Senor de la...

1077
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,948
When you see your moment, you mustn't let it pass you by.

1078
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:55,787
You must seize it.

1079
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,952
This one has a wise spirit.

1080
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:14,135
We're almost there, Dante.

1081
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:19,676
Senor de la Cruz!

1082
00:59:20,066 --> 00:59:21,244
Senor de la...

1083
00:59:26,709 --> 00:59:28,218
But what can we do?

1084
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:29,404
It is hopeless...

1085
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:31,168
You must have faith, sister.

1086
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:33,294
But Padre, he will never listen.

1087
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,869
He will listen, to music.

It's. It's you!

1097

You are that boy! The one who came from the Land of the Living.

1098
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:58,059
You... know about me?

1099

You are all anyone has been talking about.

1100
01:01:01,762 --> 01:01:03,213
Why have you come here?

1101
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:04,887
I'm Miguel.

1102
01:01:05,555 --> 01:01:08,173
Your great-great-grandson.

1103
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:11,553
I... have a great-great-grandson?

1104
01:01:11,597 --> 01:01:12,793
I need your blessing,

1105
01:01:13,301 --> 01:01:15,676
so I can go back home and be a musician.

1106
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:16,631
Just like you.

1107
01:01:17,401 --> 01:01:18,969
The rest of our family,

1108
01:01:19,678 --> 01:01:20,919
they would not listen.

1109
01:01:21,505 --> 01:01:24,018
But I hoped you would.

1110
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:28,668
My boy, with a talent like yours,

1111
01:01:29,349 --> 01:01:30,655
how could I not listen?

1112
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:36,030
I have a great-great-grandson!

1113
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:45,369
Look! It's Frida! Yes, it is I.

1114
01:01:45,371 --> 01:01:46,321
Frida Kahlo.

1115
01:01:46,323 --> 01:01:48,789
It is an honor, señora. Gracias.

1116
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,339
Hey, Negrete! Infante!

1117
01:01:55,341 --> 01:01:57,136
Have you met my great-great-grandson?

1118
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,387
My great-great-grandson.

1119
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:01,889
He's alive! And a musician to boot!

1120
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:03,804
Dimple. No dimple. Dimple. No dimple.

1121
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:04,976
No dimple!

1122
01:02:05,048 --> 01:02:06,345
To our friendship.

1123
01:02:06,917 --> 01:02:09,597
I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo.

1124

01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,851
They leave me more offerings than I know what to do with!

1130
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:31,942
Hey, what's wrong?

1131
01:02:31,944 --> 01:02:33,859
Is it too much? You look overwhelmed.

1132
01:02:33,861 --> 01:02:36,525
No! It's all great!

1133
01:02:36,527 --> 01:02:37,445
But?

1134
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:38,575
It's just...

1135
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:42,037
I have been looking up to you my whole life.

1136
01:02:42,273 --> 01:02:45,283
You're the guy who actually did it!

1137
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:48,539
But did you ever regret it?

1138
01:02:48,926 --> 01:02:52,302
Choosing music over everything else?

1139
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:54,235
It was hard.

1140
01:02:54,455 --> 01:02:56,709
Saying goodbye to my hometown.

1141
01:02:57,131 --> 01:02:58,657
Heading off on my own...

1142
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:01,166
Leaving your family?

1143
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:02,523
Sí.

1144
01:03:03,217 --> 01:03:05,939
But I could not have done it differently.

1145
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:09,378
One cannot deny who one is meant to be.

1146
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:12,221
And you, my great-great-grandson,

1147
01:03:12,223 --> 01:03:14,167
are meant to be a musician!

1148
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,351
You and I, we are artists, Miguel.

1149
01:03:19,353 --> 01:03:21,369
We cannot belong to one family.

1150
01:03:21,693 --> 01:03:23,946
The world is our family.

1151
01:03:26,546 --> 01:03:28,127
The fireworks have begun!

1152
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:42,292
Soon the party will move across town for my Sunrise Spectacular.

1153
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,759
Miguel, you must come to the show!

1154
01:03:45,761 --> 01:03:47,824
You will be my guest of honor!

1155
01:03:47,826 --> 01:03:50,115
You mean it? Of course, my boy.

1156
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:53,963
I can't.

1157
01:03:54,352 --> 01:03:56,668
I have to get home before sunrise.

1158
01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:59,119
I really do need to get you home.

1159
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,402
It has been an honor.

1160
01:04:05,948 --> 01:04:08,190
I am sorry to see you go, Miguel.

1161
01:04:08,366 --> 01:04:10,332
I hope you die very soon.

1162
01:04:12,818 --> 01:04:14,240
You know what I mean.

1163
01:04:16,409 --> 01:04:17,310
Miguel,

1164
01:04:17,903 --> 01:04:20,908
I give you my bless... We had a deal, chamaco.

1165
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:22,739
Who are you?

1166
01:04:22,741 --> 01:04:24,279
What is the meaning of this?

1167
01:04:25,658 --> 01:04:26,553
Frida!

1168
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:27,906
I thought you couldn't make it.

1169
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:30,295
You said you'd take back my photo.

1170
01:04:30,297 --> 01:04:31,403
You promised, Miguel.

1171
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:33,441
You know this man?

1172
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:35,345
I just met him tonight.

1173
01:04:35,347 --> 01:04:37,046
He told me he knew you.

1174
01:04:37,764 --> 01:04:38,488
Hé...

1175
01:04:38,942 --> 01:04:39,662
Héctor?

1176
01:04:39,664 --> 01:04:40,704
Please, Miguel.

1177
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:42,589
Put my photo up.

1178
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:45,529
My friend,

1179
01:04:45,932 --> 01:04:47,004
you're...

1180
01:04:47,375 --> 01:04:48,481
you're being forgotten.

1181
01:04:48,483 --> 01:04:49,590
And whose fault is that?

1182
01:04:49,592 --> 01:04:50,418
Héctor, please...

1183
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,680
Those were my songs you took.

1184
01:04:51,682 --> 01:04:53,573
My songs that made you famous.

1185
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,145
What? If I'm being forgotten,

1186
01:04:55,147 --> 01:04:57,583
it's because you never told anyone that I wrote them!

1187
01:04:57,585 --> 01:04:58,483
That's crazy!

1188
01:04:58,587 --> 01:05:00,997
De la Cruz wrote all his own songs.

1189
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:02,669
You want to tell him or should I?

1190
01:05:02,671 --> 01:05:03,498
Héctor,

1191
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,535
I never meant to take credit.

1192
01:05:05,537 --> 01:05:07,579
We made a great team but,

1193
01:05:07,659 --> 01:05:09,148
you died...

1194
01:05:09,312 --> 01:05:11,659
and I only sang your songs because

1195
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:14,261
I wanted to keep a part of you alive.

1196
01:05:14,363 --> 01:05:15,580
How generous!

1197
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:17,794
You really did play together.

1198
01:05:17,796 --> 01:05:18,379
Look...

1199
01:05:18,921 --> 01:05:20,240
I don't want to fight about it.

1200
01:05:20,536 --> 01:05:22,133
I just want you to make it right.

1201
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,155
Miguel can put my photo up,

1202
01:05:24,157 --> 01:05:26,069
Héctor. And I can cross over the bridge.

1203
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:27,991
I can see my girl.

1204
01:05:28,869 --> 01:05:29,687
Ernesto,

1205
01:05:30,282 --> 01:05:31,663
remember the night I left?

1206
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:33,177
That was a long time ago.

1207
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,328
We drank together

1208
01:05:34,528 --> 01:05:37,489
and you told me you would move Heaven and Earth for your amigo.

1209
01:05:38,068 --> 01:05:38,852
Well,

1210
01:05:39,363 --> 01:05:40,697
I'm asking you to now.

1211
01:05:40,699 --> 01:05:41,844
Heaven and Earth?

1212
01:05:42,198 --> 01:05:43,271
Like in the movie?

1213
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:43,801
What?

1214
01:05:44,012 --> 01:05:45,743
That's Don Hidalgo's toast.

1215
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:48,323
In the de la Cruz movie, El Camino a Casa.

1216
01:05:48,325 --> 01:05:49,995
I'm talking about my real life, Miguel.

1217
01:05:49,997 --> 01:05:51,638
No! It's in there.

1218
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:52,573
Look!

1219
01:05:52,644 --> 01:05:54,154
Never were truer words spoken.

1220
01:05:54,156 --> 01:05:56,607
This calls for a toast. To our friendship!

1221
01:05:57,465 --> 01:05:59,745
I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo.

1222
01:05:59,802 --> 01:06:00,858
But in the movie,

1223
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:02,957
Don Hidalgo poisons the drink.

1224
01:06:03,103 --> 01:06:03,995
Salud! Cheers!

1225
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:06,029
Poison!

1226
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,879
That night, Ernesto.

1227
01:06:10,587 --> 01:06:11,866
The night I left...

1228
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,813
We'd been performing on the road for months.

1229
01:06:15,303 --> 01:06:16,304
I got homesick...

1230
01:06:16,492 --> 01:06:17,884
and I packed up my songs.

1231
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:22,560
You want to give up now when we're this close to reaching our dream?

1232
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:23,568
This was your dream.

1233
01:06:23,673 --> 01:06:24,509
You'll manage.

1234
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:26,426
I can't do this without your songs, Héctor.

1235
01:06:26,547 --> 01:06:30,222
I'm going home, Ernesto. Hate me if you want, but my mind is made up.

1236
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:39,505
I could never hate you. If you must go, then I'm sending you off with a toast.

1237
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,588
To our friendship.

1238
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:48,927
I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo. Salud!

1239
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:57,765
You walked me to the train station. But I felt a pain in my stomach.

1240
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,274
I thought it must have been something I ate.

1241
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,276
Perhaps it was that chorizo, my friend.

1242
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:05,155
Or something I drank.

1243
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:10,527
I woke up dead.

1244
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,618
You poisoned me.

1245
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:18,035
You're confusing movies with reality, Héctor.

1246
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:21,455
All this time, I thought it was just bad luck.

1247
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,924
I never thought that you might have...

1248
01:07:26,051 --> 01:07:26,996
That you...

1249
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,348
How could you? Héctor!

1250
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:33,702
Security! Security!

1251
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:37,079
You took everything away from me!

1252
01:07:37,795 --> 01:07:38,664
You rat!

1253
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,285
Have him taken care of.

1254
01:07:41,501 --> 01:07:42,683
He's not well.

1255
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,864
I just wanted to go back home.

1256
01:07:45,168 --> 01:07:45,888
No!

1257
01:07:46,381 --> 01:07:47,487
No!

1258
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,170
I apologize.

1259
01:07:51,209 --> 01:07:52,286
Where were we?

1260
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:54,780
You were going to give me your blessing.

1261
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:55,715
Yes.

1262
01:07:56,716 --> 01:07:57,497
Sí.

1263
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,202
Miguel,

1264
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:03,381
my reputation...

1265
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,323
It is...

1266
01:08:05,379 --> 01:08:07,457
very important to me.

1267
01:08:07,872 --> 01:08:09,623
I would hate to have you think...

1268
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:12,327
That you murdered Héctor,

1269
01:08:12,392 --> 01:08:13,501
for his songs?

1270
01:08:15,469 --> 01:08:17,068
You don't think that.

1271
01:08:17,653 --> 01:08:18,880
Do you? I...

1272
01:08:18,882 --> 01:08:19,928
No.

1273
01:08:20,103 --> 01:08:21,282
Everyone knows you're...

1274
01:08:21,641 --> 01:08:23,288
the good guy.

1275
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,148
Papá Ernesto,

1276
01:08:31,268 --> 01:08:32,695
my blessing?

1277
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:35,906
Security?

1278
01:08:36,344 --> 01:08:37,465
Take care of Miguel.

1279
01:08:37,467 --> 01:08:39,335
He'll be extending his stay.

1280
01:08:39,354 --> 01:08:40,047
What?

1281
01:08:41,128 --> 01:08:42,298
But I'm your family!

1282
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:44,300
And Héctor was my best friend.

1283
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,976
Success doesn't come for free, Miguel.

1284
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:51,964
You have to be willing to do whatever it takes to...

1285
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:53,419
seize your moment.

1286
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:55,705
I know you understand.

1287
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:58,143
No! No!

1288
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:01,187
Let go!

1289
01:09:02,465 --> 01:09:03,099
No!

1290
01:09:03,382 --> 01:09:04,771
No!

1291
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:26,566
Help!

1292
01:09:27,341 --> 01:09:28,718
Can anyone hear me?

1293
01:09:30,196 --> 01:09:31,996
I want to go home.

1294
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:51,857
Héctor?

1295
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:52,573
Kid?

1296
01:09:53,077 --> 01:09:53,870
Héctor!

1297
01:09:54,965 --> 01:09:55,862
You were right.

1298
01:09:55,872 --> 01:09:58,007
I should have gone back to my family.

1299
01:09:58,126 --> 01:10:00,909
They told me not to be like de la Cruz,

1300
01:10:01,236 --> 01:10:02,617
but I didn't listen.

1301
01:10:02,619 --> 01:10:05,464
I told them I didn't care if they remembered me.

1302
01:10:05,531 --> 01:10:08,410
I didn't care if I was on their stupid ofrenda.

1303
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:09,915
Hey, chamaco.

1304
01:10:09,917 --> 01:10:11,749
It's ok. It's ok.

1305
01:10:11,822 --> 01:10:14,396
I told them I didn't care.

1306
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:20,925
Héctor! Héctor?

1307
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:23,007
She's...

1308
01:10:24,007 --> 01:10:25,191
forgetting me.

1309
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:26,675
Who?

1310
01:10:27,462 --> 01:10:28,700
My daughter.

1311
01:10:30,951 --> 01:10:35,140
She's the reason you wanted to cross the bridge.

1312
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,665
I just wanted to see her again.

1313
01:10:39,275 --> 01:10:41,473
I never should have left Santa Cezilia.

1314
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:44,790
I wish I could apologize.

1315
01:10:45,029 --> 01:10:48,424
I wish I could tell her that her Papá was trying to come home.

1316
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:51,290
That he loved her so much.

1317
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,088
My Coco...

1318
01:10:57,837 --> 01:10:59,143
Coco?

1319
01:11:14,636 --> 01:11:15,596
Where...

1320
01:11:16,404 --> 01:11:17,820
did you get this?

1321
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:20,443
That's my Mamá Coco.

1322
01:11:20,806 --> 01:11:22,492
That's my Mamá Imelda.

1323
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:24,537
Is that...

1324
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:26,681
you?

1325
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:31,193
We're...

1326
01:11:32,544 --> 01:11:33,527
family?

1327
01:11:46,206 --> 01:11:48,730
I always hoped I'd see her again.

1328
01:11:49,634 --> 01:11:50,675
That she'd miss me.

1329
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:52,622
Maybe put up my photo.

1330
01:11:53,652 --> 01:11:54,900
But it never happened.

1331
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:57,526
You know the worst part?

1332
01:11:58,191 --> 01:12:00,738
Even if I never got to see Coco in the living world...

1333
01:12:01,166 --> 01:12:03,676
I thought at least one day I'd see her here.

1334
01:12:04,379 --> 01:12:05,924
Give her the biggest hug.

1335
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,744
But she's the last person who remembers me.

1336
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:13,792
The moment she's gone from the living world...

1337
01:12:14,018 --> 01:12:15,383
You disappear...

1338
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:17,324
from this one.

1339
01:12:18,105 --> 01:12:19,847
You'll never get to see her.

1340
01:12:19,922 --> 01:12:21,177
Ever again.

1341
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:25,595
You know,

1342
01:12:25,922 --> 01:12:27,382
I wrote her a song once.

1343
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:29,887
We used to sing it every night,

1344
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:31,564
at the same time.

1345
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:34,434
No matter how far apart we were.

1346
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,871
What I would not give to sing it to her,

1347
01:12:38,401 --> 01:12:39,061
one...

1348
01:12:39,341 --> 01:12:40,127
last...

1349
01:12:40,451 --> 01:12:41,222
time.

1350
01:12:42,969 --> 01:12:46,284

He stole your guitar.

1366
01:13:50,147 --> 01:13:51,803
He stole your songs.

1367
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:54,761
You should be the one the world remembers,

1368
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:56,016
not de la Cruz!

1369
01:13:56,086 --> 01:13:57,947
I didn't write Remember Me for the world.

1370
01:13:58,862 --> 01:14:00,728
I wrote it for Coco.

1371
01:14:02,342 --> 01:14:04,878
I'm a pretty sorry excuse for a great-great-grandpa.

1372
01:14:05,148 --> 01:14:05,968
Are you kidding?

1373
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:08,558
A minute ago I thought I was related to a murderer.

1374
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:10,203
You're a total upgrade.

1375
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:12,365
My whole life,

1376
01:14:12,524 --> 01:14:14,967
there is been something that made me different.

1377
01:14:15,488 --> 01:14:17,422
And I never knew where it came from.

1378
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:19,253
But now I know.

1379
01:14:19,381 --> 01:14:21,101
It comes from you.

1380
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:23,543
I'm proud we're family!

1381
01:14:24,631 --> 01:14:27,010
I'm proud to be his family!

1382
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:36,550
I'm proud to be his family!

1383
01:14:51,864 --> 01:14:52,776
Dante?

1384
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:56,150
Dante!

1385
01:14:58,744 --> 01:14:59,959
It's Dante!

1386
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:12,485
Imelda!

1387
01:15:13,432 --> 01:15:14,626
Héctor.

1388
01:15:15,436 --> 01:15:16,645
You look good.

1389
01:15:28,242 --> 01:15:31,417
Dante! You knew he was my Papá Héctor the whole time!

1390
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:33,519
You are a real spirit guide.

1391
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,307
Who's the good spirit guide?

1392
01:15:35,309 --> 01:15:36,230
You are!

1393
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:56,952
Dante!

1394
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:22,057
There they are!

1395
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:23,282
Miguel! Miguelito!

1396
01:16:23,363 --> 01:16:24,697
Look, it's Miguel!

1397
01:16:25,482 --> 01:16:26,552
He's alright.

1398
01:16:27,218 --> 01:16:28,586
Gracias, Dios mío. Thank, my God.

1399
01:16:29,524 --> 01:16:30,678
Qué bueno. That good.

1400
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,374
Mijo, I was so worried!

1401
01:16:47,376 --> 01:16:49,627
Thank goodness we found you in time.

1402
01:16:50,523 --> 01:16:51,427
And you...

1403
01:16:51,918 --> 01:16:54,246
How many times must I turn you away?

1404
01:16:54,301 --> 01:16:54,941
Imelda.

1405
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:56,650
I want nothing to do with you!

1406
01:16:56,652 --> 01:16:58,529
Not in life, not in death!

1407
01:16:58,779 --> 01:17:02,001
I spent decades protecting my family from your mistakes.

1408
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:05,856
He spends five minutes with you and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole!

1409
01:17:05,858 --> 01:17:07,450
I wasn't in there because of Héctor.

1410
01:17:07,685 --> 01:17:09,311
He was in there because of me.

1411
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:12,383
He was just trying to get me home!

1412
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:14,101
I didn't want to listen,

1413
01:17:14,457 --> 01:17:15,872
but he was right.

1414
01:17:16,674 --> 01:17:18,551
Nothing's more important than family.

1415
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:22,729
I'm ready to accept your blessing.

1416
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:24,714
And your conditions.

1417
01:17:25,187 --> 01:17:27,408
But first, I need to find de la Cruz.

1418
01:17:27,828 --> 01:17:29,505
To get Héctor's photo. What?

1419
01:17:29,507 --> 01:17:30,933
So he can see Coco again.

1420
01:17:30,987 --> 01:17:32,993
Héctor should be on our ofrenda.

1421
01:17:32,995 --> 01:17:34,302
He's part of our family.

1422
01:17:34,304 --> 01:17:35,732
He left this family!

1423
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:37,631
He tried to go home to you and Coco.

1424
01:17:37,633 --> 01:17:39,532
But de la Cruz murdered him!

1425
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:41,995
It's true, Imelda.

1426
01:17:42,983 --> 01:17:44,567
And so what if it's true?

1427
01:17:44,727 --> 01:17:46,900
You leave me alone with a child to raise...

1428
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:49,008
and I'm just supposed to forgive you?

1429
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:50,082
Imelda, I...

1430
01:17:51,041 --> 01:17:52,293
Héctor!

1431
01:17:55,242 --> 01:17:56,661
I'm running out of time.

1432
01:17:57,881 --> 01:17:58,859
It's Coco.

1433
01:17:59,826 --> 01:18:01,319
She's forgetting you.

1434
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,499
You don't have to forgive him.

1435
01:18:05,123 --> 01:18:07,627
But we should not forget him.

1436
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:12,668
I wanted to forget you.

1437
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:16,193
I wanted Coco to forget you too, but...

1438
01:18:16,195 --> 01:18:17,383
This is my fault.

1439
01:18:18,366 --> 01:18:19,368
Not yours.

1440
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,161
I'm sorry, Imelda.

1441
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:28,724
Miguel,

1442
01:18:29,197 --> 01:18:31,217
if we help you get his photo,

1443
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:32,927
you will return home?

1444
01:18:33,148 --> 01:18:34,149
No more music?

1445
01:18:35,461 --> 01:18:37,759
Family comes first.

1446
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:40,988
I...

1447
01:18:41,497 --> 01:18:43,253
I can't forgive you.

1448
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:46,976
But I will help you.

1449
01:18:48,981 --> 01:18:51,352
So, how do we get to de la Cruz?

1450
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,772
I might know a way.

1451
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:47,711
Good luck, muchacho. Gracias, Frida.

1452
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,377
Here, let me help you with... Don't touch me!

1453
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,910
Everyone clear on the plan? Find Héctor's photo.

1454
01:20:02,005 --> 01:20:03,770
Give it to Miguel. Send Miguel home.

1455
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:05,009
Got your petals?

1456
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,392
Now, we just have to find de la Cruz.

1457
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:09,458
Yes?

1458
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:12,311
Don't I know you?

1459
01:20:13,403 --> 01:20:15,861
That's for murdering the love of my life!

1460
01:20:16,006 --> 01:20:18,131
Who... Who the... She's talking about me!

1461
01:20:18,147 --> 01:20:20,105
I'm the love of your life? I don't know.

1462
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:21,280
I'm still angry at you.

1463
01:20:21,367 --> 01:20:22,504
Héctor! How did you...

1464
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:25,516
And that's for trying to murder my grandson.

1465
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:26,450
Grandson?

1466
01:20:26,452 --> 01:20:27,794
She's talking about me!

1467
01:20:27,796 --> 01:20:28,644
You!

1468
01:20:29,029 --> 01:20:29,834
Wait.

1469
01:20:30,145 --> 01:20:32,032
You're related to Héctor?

1470
01:20:32,036 --> 01:20:33,083
The photo!

1471
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:38,710
After him!

1472
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:42,392
Security! Ayúdenme! Security! Help me!

1473
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:44,589
You said love of your life.

1474
01:20:44,591 --> 01:20:45,972
I don't know what I said.

1475
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,357
That's what I heard.

1476
01:21:01,106 --> 01:21:02,875
Places, Senor. You're on in thirty seconds.

1477
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:11,963
Ay! Miguel! I have it!

1478
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,597
Hurry! Come on!

1479
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:33,538
Ladies and gentlemen.

1480
01:21:33,973 --> 01:21:36,143
The one, the only.

1481
01:21:36,271 --> 01:21:39,792
Ernesto de la Cruz!

1482
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:49,802
Get her off the stage.

1483
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:00,935

You...

1508
01:23:53,914 --> 01:23:55,017
still got it.

1509
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:03,921
Miguel, I give you my blessing.

1510
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:06,808
To go home,

1511
01:24:07,389 --> 01:24:11,020
to put up our photos and to never...

1512
01:24:11,022 --> 01:24:13,167
Never play music again.

1513
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:15,870
To never...

1514
01:24:16,059 --> 01:24:19,231
forget how much your family loves you.

1515
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,437
You're going home.

1516
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:28,879
You're not going anywhere.

1517
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:31,596
Imelda!

1518
01:24:31,875 --> 01:24:33,217
Stay back! Stay back!

1519
01:24:33,729 --> 01:24:35,490
All of you, stay back.

1520
01:24:35,861 --> 01:24:37,396
Not one more step.

1521
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,365
Dante!

1522
01:24:42,294 --> 01:24:43,567
Ernesto, stop!

1523
01:24:45,028 --> 01:24:46,263
Leave the boy alone.

1524
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:48,218
I've worked too hard, Héctor.

1525
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:50,655
Too hard to let him destroy everything.

1526
01:24:50,657 --> 01:24:52,598
He's a living child, Ernesto.

1527
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:53,725
He's a threat!

1528
01:24:54,474 --> 01:24:57,941
You think I'd let him go back to the Land of the Living with your photo?

1529
01:24:58,015 --> 01:25:00,306
To keep your memory alive?

1530
01:25:00,308 --> 01:25:01,065
No.

1531
01:25:01,067 --> 01:25:03,781
You're a coward! I am Ernesto de la Cruz.

1532
01:25:03,804 --> 01:25:05,807
The greatest musician of all time!

1533
01:25:05,872 --> 01:25:07,715
Héctor's the real musician.

1534
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:10,599
You're just the guy who murdered him and stole his songs!

1535
01:25:10,601 --> 01:25:11,277
Murdered?

1536
01:25:11,796 --> 01:25:15,616
I am the one who's willing to do what it takes to seize my moment.

1537
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:17,754
Whatever it takes.

1538
01:25:20,555 --> 01:25:21,232
No!

Apologies, old friend.

1541
01:25:27,255 --> 01:25:28,716
But the show must go on.

1542
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:13,814
Please, please, mi familia.

1543
01:26:13,841 --> 01:26:15,656
Murderer! Get off the stage!

1544
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:17,835
Orchestra. A-one, a-two, a-one...

1545
01:26:17,934 --> 01:26:19,211

1551
01:26:54,843 --> 01:26:57,003
No, please! I beg of you! Stop!

1552
01:26:57,123 --> 01:26:58,557
Stop! No!

1553
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:08,432
No! No!

1554
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:21,591
What did I miss?

1555
01:27:21,899 --> 01:27:23,367
Good boy, Dante!

1556
01:27:23,468 --> 01:27:24,261
Miguel!

1557
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:27,458
Héctor!

1558
01:27:28,568 --> 01:27:30,548
The photo... I lost it!

1559
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:31,518
It's ok, mijo.

1560
01:27:32,186 --> 01:27:33,091
It's o...

1561
01:27:33,693 --> 01:27:34,656
Héctor!

1562
01:27:35,229 --> 01:27:36,339
Héctor?

1563
01:27:37,506 --> 01:27:38,382
Coco.

1564
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,899
No! We can still find the photo.

1565
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:42,649
Miguel, it's almost sunrise.

1566
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:45,546
No, no. I can't leave you.

1567
01:27:45,627 --> 01:27:47,716
I promised I'd put your photo up.

1568
01:27:48,001 --> 01:27:50,100
I promised you'd see Coco.

1569
01:27:50,605 --> 01:27:52,239
We're both out of time, mijo.

1570
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:55,383
Oh no! No!

1571
01:27:55,464 --> 01:27:56,940
She can't forget you!

1572
01:27:57,210 --> 01:27:58,968
I just wanted her to know...

1573
01:27:59,724 --> 01:28:01,337
that I loved her.

1574
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:03,146
Héctor!

1575
01:28:03,148 --> 01:28:05,495
You have our blessing, Miguel.

1576
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:07,356
No conditions.

1577
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:11,085
No! Papá Héctor, please!

1578
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:16,379
No!

1579
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:19,135
Go home.

1580
01:28:19,137 --> 01:28:21,806
I promise I won't let Coco forget you!

1581
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:50,528
There he is!

1582
01:28:51,897 --> 01:28:53,438
Miguel! Stop!

1583
01:28:58,750 --> 01:28:59,935
Where have you been?

1584
01:29:00,055 --> 01:29:01,912
I need to see Mamá Coco, please.

1585
01:29:02,283 --> 01:29:04,574
What are you doing with that... Give it to me!

1586
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:06,573
Miguel, stop!

1587
01:29:06,575 --> 01:29:08,557
Miguel! Miguel!

1588
01:29:09,208 --> 01:29:10,216
Miguel!

1589
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:11,725
Mamá Coco?

1590
01:29:11,863 --> 01:29:13,278
Can you hear me?

1591
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,564
It's Miguel.

1592
01:29:15,225 --> 01:29:16,985
I saw your Papá.

1593
01:29:16,987 --> 01:29:18,966
Remember? Papá?

1594
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:21,127
Please!

1595
01:29:21,755 --> 01:29:22,979
If you forget him,

1596
01:29:22,981 --> 01:29:25,743
he'll be gone. Forever.

1597
01:29:26,078 --> 01:29:27,205
Miguel, open this door!

1598
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:28,603
Here.

1599
01:29:28,605 --> 01:29:30,373
This was his guitar, right?

1600
01:29:30,375 --> 01:29:32,205
He used to play it to you?

1601
01:29:34,747 --> 01:29:36,589
See? There he is!

1602
01:29:38,066 --> 01:29:40,175
Papá! Remember?

1603
01:29:40,177 --> 01:29:41,143
Papá?

1604
01:29:44,462 --> 01:29:45,457
Miguel!

1605
01:29:45,459 --> 01:29:47,119
Mamá Coco, please!

1606
01:29:47,121 --> 01:29:48,310
Don't forget him.

1607
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,065
What are you doing to that poor woman?

1608
01:29:57,067 --> 01:29:57,856
It's ok, Mamita. It's ok.

1609
01:29:57,976 --> 01:29:59,478
What's gotten into you?

1610
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:07,762
I thought I'd lost you, Miguel.

1611
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,477
I'm sorry, Papá.

1612
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:11,080
We're all together now.

1613
01:30:11,082 --> 01:30:12,788
That's what matters.

1614
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:14,952
Not all of us.

1615
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:16,472
It's ok, Mamita.

1616
01:30:17,333 --> 01:30:20,457
Miguel, you apologize to your Mamá Coco.

1617
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,090
Mamá Coco?

1618
01:30:30,198 --> 01:30:31,950
Well? Apologize!

1619
01:30:35,972 --> 01:30:37,267
Mamá Coco?

1620
01:30:38,057 --> 01:30:39,504
Your Papá,

1621
01:30:40,044 --> 01:30:42,032
he wanted you to have this.

1622
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:45,486

Poems he wrote me.

1648
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:43,047
And...

1649
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:04,956
Papá was a musician.

1650
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:07,474
When I was a little girl...

1651
01:33:07,873 --> 01:33:13,144
he and Mamá would sing such beautiful songs.

1652
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:29,953
And right over here, one of Santa Cezilia's greatest treasures.

The home of the esteemed song writer, Héctor Rivera.

The letters Héctor wrote home for his daughter, Coco,
