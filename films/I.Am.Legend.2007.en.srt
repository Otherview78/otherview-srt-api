Thank you for joining us this morning.

-Not at all. -So, Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.

24
00:01:10,377 --> 00:01:13,073
Well, the premise is quite simple.

25
00:01:13,247 --> 00:01:16,614
Take something designed by nature and reprogram it...

26
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:20,083
...to make it work for the body rather than against it.

27
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:21,881
-We're talking about a virus? -Yes.

28
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:23,853
ln this case, the measles virus...

29
00:01:24,024 --> 00:01:29,189
...which has been engineered at a genetic level to be helpful rather than harmful.

30
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:32,662
Um, l'm not-- l find the best way to describe it is...

31
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,324
...if you can imagine your body as a highway...

32
00:01:35,502 --> 00:01:40,371
...and you picture the virus as a very fast car being driven by a very bad man...

33
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:43,567
...imagine the damage that that car could cause.

34
00:01:43,744 --> 00:01:47,043
But then if you replace that man with a cop...

35
00:01:47,214 --> 00:01:50,547
...the picture changes. And that's essentially what we've done.

36
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:53,016
Now, how many people have you treated so far?

37
00:01:53,187 --> 00:01:56,816
Well, we've had 1 0,009 clinical trials in humans so far.

38
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,722
-And how many are cancer-free? -Ten thousand and nine.

39
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:04,023
So you have actually cured cancer?

40
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:07,861
Yes, yes. Yes, we have.

00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:01,495
''Hello.

158
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:04,234
Wanna see some infected rats?''

159
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:14,242
Okay, tomorrow. l'm gonna say hello tomorrow.

160
00:21:23,523 --> 00:21:25,150
Psst.

161
00:21:39,238 --> 00:21:41,297
Come here. Hey. Hey.

162
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:43,567
Good job. You did so good.

163
00:21:43,743 --> 00:21:46,541
Yes. Yes.

164
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:41,899
Ah.

165
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:48,232
Look at that. See that? Red salmon.

166
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:51,638
Wow, actual Spam. Yeah.

167
00:22:51,811 --> 00:22:53,802
You'll get some of that later.

168
00:23:16,936 --> 00:23:18,528
Let's go.

169
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:25,867
Wait.

170
00:24:04,784 --> 00:24:07,685
ROBERT : My name is Robert Neville.

171
00:24:07,853 --> 00:24:10,515
I am a survivor living in New York City.

172
00:24:11,857 --> 00:24:16,260
I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.

173
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:19,865
I will be at the South Street Seaport every day at midday...

174
00:24:20,032 --> 00:24:23,092
...when the sun is highest in the sky.

175
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:27,067
If you are out there....

176
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,907
If anyone is out there....

177
00:24:31,077 --> 00:24:33,341
I can provide food.

178
00:24:33,813 --> 00:24:36,247
I can provide shelter.

179
00:24:36,782 --> 00:24:39,216
I can provide security.

180
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,811
If there's anybody out there...

181
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,753
...anybody....

182
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:48,084
Please.

183
00:24:48,928 --> 00:24:50,987
You are not alone.

184
00:24:53,499 --> 00:24:56,366
Fore!

185
00:25:15,955 --> 00:25:17,923
Yeah.

186
00:25:22,862 --> 00:25:25,422
Keep your eye on this one for me.

187
00:25:28,901 --> 00:25:29,959
Ooh.

188
00:25:35,374 --> 00:25:37,569
l'm getting good.

189
00:26:10,976 --> 00:26:12,603
Ss-ss.

190
00:26:25,024 --> 00:26:26,992
Sam! No, no, no!

191
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,520
No! No! Sam!

192
00:26:28,894 --> 00:26:30,418
No! No!

193
00:26:32,298 --> 00:26:34,960
Sam? Sam? Sam?

194
00:26:35,134 --> 00:26:37,694
Sam? Sam?

195
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,072
Sam? Sam?

196
00:26:43,342 --> 00:26:45,367
Hello, Sam?

197
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:49,079
Sam?

198
00:26:52,385 --> 00:26:54,046
Sam?

199
00:26:54,553 --> 00:26:56,851
Come on. Sam.

200
00:27:35,127 --> 00:27:37,322
l gotta go, Sam.

201
00:27:37,496 --> 00:27:40,624
l gotta go. l gotta go.

202
00:29:24,503 --> 00:29:26,198
Sam?

203
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:39,743
Sam? Sam?

204
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:42,445
Sam? Sam?

205
00:30:42,615 --> 00:30:45,516
Sam. Sam.

206
00:30:45,684 --> 00:30:49,313
Sam. Sam, come on, we gotta go. Sam.

207
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:51,886
What are you doing?

208
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:05,234
Sam, we gotta go!

209
00:31:13,712 --> 00:31:14,974
Sam, go! Go!

210
00:31:15,147 --> 00:31:17,479
Sam, get out! Get out!

211
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:19,299
You gotta pay attention, okay? You gotta pay attention.

212
00:32:19,478 --> 00:32:21,105
Listen, uh...

213
00:32:22,214 --> 00:32:25,206
...l want you to stay here on this one, okay?

214
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:30,349
Because you can still get infected.

215
00:32:31,156 --> 00:32:32,953
And l can't.

216
00:32:49,808 --> 00:32:52,936
So, look, if l'm not back by dark...

217
00:32:56,248 --> 00:32:58,045
...just go.

218
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:34,577
Okay. Subject is female. Likely 1 8 to 20 years of age.

219
00:34:34,746 --> 00:34:39,080
Dilaudid push only sedates effectively at six times human dose.

220
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:43,119
Core temperature, 1 06 Fahrenheit. Pulse, 200 bpm.

221
00:34:43,288 --> 00:34:44,414
Respiration elevated.

222
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:48,458
PA 02, 300 percent of normal.

223
00:34:54,867 --> 00:34:57,267
Pupils fully dilated.

224
00:34:57,436 --> 00:34:59,768
Nonreactive to light.

225
00:35:29,768 --> 00:35:32,134
Extreme reaction to UV exposure.

226
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:38,004
Symptoms and tissue samples confirm subject is infected with KV.

227
00:35:40,746 --> 00:35:41,974
Vaccine test.

228
00:35:42,147 --> 00:35:46,447
GA series, serum 391 , Compound 6.

229
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:48,752
Commencing human trials.

230
00:36:13,245 --> 00:36:14,678
Respiration slowing.

231
00:36:16,281 --> 00:36:19,876
Pulse, 1 90. Core temperature...

232
00:36:20,552 --> 00:36:22,577
...1 05...

233
00:36:22,754 --> 00:36:25,245
...1 04 and decreasing.

234
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:29,320
We may have something here.

235
00:37:15,007 --> 00:37:20,946
GA series, serum 391 , Compound 6 ineffective on humans.

236
00:37:39,598 --> 00:37:44,262
Test results linked to this entry saved on six redundant drives.

237
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:46,427
Still no cure.

238
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:05,848
ROBERT: Day 1 001.

239
00:38:06,024 --> 00:38:09,152
We came in close contact with a hive today.

240
00:38:09,327 --> 00:38:13,058
Blood tests confirm that I remain immune to both the airborne...

241
00:38:13,532 --> 00:38:16,000
...and contact strains.

242
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:21,037
Canines remain immune to airborne strain only.

243
00:38:23,108 --> 00:38:26,373
You can't go running into the dark, dummy.

244
00:38:28,747 --> 00:38:30,180
Vaccine trials continue.

245
00:38:30,348 --> 00:38:34,409
l'm still unable to transfer my immunity to infected hosts.

246
00:38:34,586 --> 00:38:37,851
The Krippin Virus is...

247
00:38:38,023 --> 00:38:40,014
...elegant.

248
00:38:45,063 --> 00:38:48,191
Just fishing in the dark, son.

249
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:55,072
Mm. A behavioral note, um:

250
00:38:56,074 --> 00:39:00,568
An infected male exposed himself to sunlight today.

251
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:05,547
Now, it's possible decreased brain function...

252
00:39:05,717 --> 00:39:10,814
...or the growing scarcity of food is causing them to...

253
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:15,926
...ignore their basic survival instincts.

254
00:39:18,663 --> 00:39:22,292
Social de-evolution appears complete.

255
00:39:22,801 --> 00:39:27,738
Typical human behavior is now entirely absent.

256
00:39:34,613 --> 00:39:36,103
Why are we stopping?

257
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:42,611
The street's closed, folks. We hoof it.

258
00:39:42,787 --> 00:39:46,052
-We got less than 1 0 minutes. -Baby, give me the dog.

259
00:39:49,694 --> 00:39:51,662
-Come on, baby. Let's go. Let's go. MARLEY: Daddy!

260
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,162
lt's all right. lt's all right. Come on.

261
00:39:54,633 --> 00:39:58,000
MlKE: Keep the colonel and his family between us and don't let anyone stop you.

262
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,569
MARLEY: Mommy, they have guns!

263
00:39:59,738 --> 00:40:01,729
lt's okay. They're in the Army like Daddy.

264
00:40:01,907 --> 00:40:04,000
MAN 1 : Unless you have clearance...

265
00:40:04,176 --> 00:40:07,577
...you cannot pass the checkpoint. Please return to your homes.

266
00:40:07,746 --> 00:40:11,147
MlKE: Make a hole, make a hole! Coming through!

267
00:40:16,755 --> 00:40:18,780
Coming through!

268
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:53,780
MAN 1 : Unless you have clearance, you cannot pass the checkpoint.

269
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:56,018
Please return to your homes.

270
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,064
MAN 2: You're clear. Move ahead.

271
00:41:04,502 --> 00:41:05,526
You're clear.

272
00:41:05,971 --> 00:41:08,269
MAN 3: All right, that's it, move up.

273
00:41:09,107 --> 00:41:10,836
All right, step up.

274
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:13,573
You're clear. Next. Let's go.

275
00:41:14,813 --> 00:41:16,246
No good.

276
00:41:16,414 --> 00:41:19,440
MAN 4: Military quarantine is about to begin.

277
00:41:20,986 --> 00:41:22,544
MAN 5: Come on, step back.

278
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:25,554
-Military quarantine is about to begin. -Look, look, look.

279
00:41:25,724 --> 00:41:27,658
WOMAN: l'm not infected. MAN 2: Clear. Good, go on.

280
00:41:27,826 --> 00:41:28,952
l'm not infected.

281
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,559
Please! Please!

282
00:41:30,729 --> 00:41:34,460
-Please take my baby. Take my baby, please. MAN 5: You're gonna have to move back.

283
00:41:36,534 --> 00:41:38,001
-No good. MAN 6: Follow me, ma'am.

284
00:41:38,169 --> 00:41:41,502
ZOE: What? No! Robert! Robert!

285
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:43,868
Get your hands off my wife. Get your hands off.

286
00:41:44,042 --> 00:41:46,408
-Mommy! MlKE: Stand down.

287
00:41:46,578 --> 00:41:47,602
Lieutenant--

288
00:41:47,779 --> 00:41:50,441
-Mommy! -Scan her again. Get your hands off of her!

289
00:41:50,615 --> 00:41:52,082
Get your hands off of my wife.

290
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,582
MlKE: Stand down! -Scan her again. Stand down!

291
00:41:54,753 --> 00:41:57,347
Stand down, soldier! Stand down!

292
00:41:57,522 --> 00:42:01,117
l am Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville. l am ordering you to scan her again.

293
00:42:01,293 --> 00:42:02,988
Scan her again!

294
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:08,590
All right, scan her again.

295
00:42:11,603 --> 00:42:14,401
-lt's clear. -lt's clear. Move through.

296
00:42:16,775 --> 00:42:17,935
Who's next? Come on.

297
00:42:18,109 --> 00:42:21,010
Take my baby with you! Please! Please!

298
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:24,376
-Mommy! -Please take my baby. Please!

299
00:42:25,817 --> 00:42:29,583
Daddy, why can't the little girl come too?

300
00:42:30,121 --> 00:42:32,316
MAN 4: Stay away from the shoreline.

301
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,151
How long?

302
00:42:34,659 --> 00:42:36,593
Five minutes. We'll make it.

303
00:42:36,761 --> 00:42:39,924
This is Ranger 621 , we're on site.

304
00:42:40,498 --> 00:42:43,661
Military quarantine is about to begin.

305
00:42:55,747 --> 00:43:00,741
l won't take my eyes off them, colonel. You got my word on it.

306
00:43:05,657 --> 00:43:07,249
ROBERT: Give me a kiss.

307
00:43:17,736 --> 00:43:20,398
I love you. I love you.

308
00:43:21,106 --> 00:43:23,973
Dear Lord, please watch over Robert...

309
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:26,474
...and keep him strong through the struggles ahead.

310
00:43:26,644 --> 00:43:30,671
Lord, please just bring him home safely. Amen.

311
00:43:32,217 --> 00:43:34,685
Daddy's gonna make the monsters go away, baby, okay?

312
00:43:34,853 --> 00:43:37,151
Sam, you protect Daddy.

313
00:43:37,322 --> 00:43:41,281
-No, baby, l can't. Daddy can't take a dog. MAN 7: Sir, we gotta go!

314
00:43:44,028 --> 00:43:47,395
Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.

315
00:43:48,032 --> 00:43:50,296
It's a butterfly.

316
00:43:52,804 --> 00:43:54,863
All right, come on, let's go!

317
00:44:41,234 --> 00:44:42,758
How'd you sleep?

318
00:44:42,936 --> 00:44:46,064
Dr. Neville will be taking a closer look at the ongoing mutations...

319
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:51,142
...of Dr. Alice Krippin's once-hailed miracle cure for cancer.

320
00:44:51,311 --> 00:44:55,441
So far, almost 5000 patients treated with her retrofitted virus...

321
00:44:55,615 --> 00:44:59,449
...have begun exhibiting symptoms resembling the early onset of rabies.

322
00:44:59,619 --> 00:45:02,417
Twenty-five patients have already died.

323
00:45:02,589 --> 00:45:06,787
Dr. Neville has ordered local hospitals to stockpile antiviral drugs...

324
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,895
...and to begin preliminary quarantine protocols.

325
00:45:10,063 --> 00:45:11,621
lt's my birthday.

326
00:45:11,798 --> 00:45:15,165
We are fully confident Dr. Neville can see us through these--

327
00:45:15,335 --> 00:45:17,030
You gonna sing?

328
00:45:17,971 --> 00:45:20,405
ROBERT : My name is Robert Neville.

329
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,137
I am a survivor living in New York City.

330
00:45:26,146 --> 00:45:29,877
I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.

331
00:45:30,517 --> 00:45:34,146
I will be at the South Street Seaport every day at midday...

332
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,153
...when the sun is highest in the sky.

333
00:45:38,324 --> 00:45:43,387
If you are out there, if anyone is out there....

334
00:45:43,563 --> 00:45:47,761
I can provide food. I can provide shelter.

335
00:45:47,934 --> 00:45:50,664
I can provide security.

336
00:45:50,837 --> 00:45:54,329
If there's anybody out there, anybody....

337
00:45:56,676 --> 00:45:58,473
Please.

338
00:45:59,078 --> 00:46:01,069
You are not alone.

339
00:46:02,081 --> 00:46:03,673
Listen, uh...

340
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:07,217
...if you're planning a party or something, just tell me now.

341
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,284
Okay? Because you know l don't like surprises.

342
00:46:10,456 --> 00:46:14,051
And l swear l'll act surprised. Okay?

343
00:46:44,057 --> 00:46:45,820
Hey! Hey!

No.

348
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,187
What the hell are you doing out here, Fred?!

349
00:47:17,557 --> 00:47:19,821
How did you get out here?!

350
00:47:19,923 --> 00:47:23,086
Fred, if you're real, you better tell me right now!

351
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:26,695
lf you're real, you better tell me right now!

352
00:47:39,676 --> 00:47:41,803

365
00:53:42,205 --> 00:53:44,605

You're okay.

378
00:55:09,425 --> 00:55:11,154
Don't worry

379
00:55:13,362 --> 00:55:15,489
About a thing

380
00:55:16,532 --> 00:55:21,697
'Cause every little thing Is gonna be all right

381
00:55:25,174 --> 00:55:30,806
Don't worry About a thing

382
00:55:35,618 --> 00:55:38,052
Rise up this morning

383
00:55:39,689 --> 00:55:42,283
Smiled with the rising sun

384
00:55:48,597 --> 00:55:50,622
Three little birds

385
00:58:53,849 --> 00:58:56,283
l promised my friend...

386
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,085
...that l would say hello to you today.

387
00:59:07,763 --> 00:59:09,492
Hello.

388
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:18,934
Hello.

389
00:59:29,418 --> 00:59:32,216
Please say hello to me.

390
00:59:39,094 --> 00:59:41,858
Please say hello to me.

391
01:01:02,344 --> 01:01:03,902
Die!

392
01:01:04,213 --> 01:01:05,305
Die!

393
01:01:19,328 --> 01:01:21,057
Die!

394
01:03:01,063 --> 01:03:04,464
WOMAN : Come on! Stay with me!

395
01:03:06,001 --> 01:03:08,561
Where do you live?

396
01:03:10,405 --> 01:03:12,270
Hey.

397
01:03:12,741 --> 01:03:14,265
Hey!

398
01:03:14,443 --> 01:03:16,570
Stay with me.

399
01:03:17,479 --> 01:03:19,743
Where do you live?

400
01:03:22,718 --> 01:03:25,243
Where do you live?

401
01:03:26,021 --> 01:03:27,249
ROBERT: Uh....

402
01:03:27,422 --> 01:03:31,620
1 1 Washington Square.

403
01:03:32,161 --> 01:03:34,891
They don't know where l live.

404
01:03:35,798 --> 01:03:39,256
Don't-- Don't let them track us.

405
01:03:39,701 --> 01:03:42,226
You gotta stay out till dawn.

406
01:04:46,101 --> 01:04:47,090
No!

407
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:50,604
MAN : Donkey?

408
01:04:51,573 --> 01:04:52,665
What are you doing?

409
01:04:52,841 --> 01:04:56,174
I would think of all people you would recognize a wall when you see one.

410
01:04:56,345 --> 01:05:01,112
Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it.

411
01:05:01,283 --> 01:05:04,252
DONKEY: It is. Around your half, see? That's your half, this is my half.

412
01:05:04,419 --> 01:05:07,980
SHREK: Oh, your half? Hm. DONKEY: Yes, my half.

413
01:05:08,156 --> 01:05:11,785
I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty.

414
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:15,327
Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head.

415
01:05:15,497 --> 01:05:17,624
SHREK: Back off! DONKEY: No, you back off.

416
01:05:17,799 --> 01:05:19,858
SHREK: This is my swamp! DONKEY: Our swamp.

417
01:05:22,704 --> 01:05:25,502
-Smelly ogre. SHREK: Fine!

418
01:05:26,208 --> 01:05:27,937
DONKEY: Come back, I'm not through with you!

419
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:29,600
SHREK: Well, I'm through with you.

420
01:05:29,778 --> 01:05:32,872
DONKEY: You know, with you it's always "me, me, me. "

421
01:05:33,048 --> 01:05:38,111
Well, guess what, now it's my turn. So you just shut up and pay attention!

422
01:05:38,287 --> 01:05:42,451
You are mean to me! You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do.

423
01:05:42,624 --> 01:05:45,024
You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.

424
01:05:45,193 --> 01:05:49,562
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?

425
01:05:49,731 --> 01:05:52,894
DONKEY: Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!

426
01:05:53,268 --> 01:05:54,963
SHREK: Oh, yeah.

427
01:05:55,137 --> 01:05:57,469
You're right, Donkey. I forgive you...

428
01:05:57,639 --> 01:05:59,106
...for stabbing me in the back!

429
01:06:02,477 --> 01:06:05,969
DONKEY: You're so wrapped up in layers, you're afraid of your own feelings.

430
01:06:06,148 --> 01:06:07,308
SHREK: Go away. DONKEY: See?

431
01:06:07,482 --> 01:06:09,609
Doing it again, just like you did to Fiona...

432
01:06:09,785 --> 01:06:11,980
...and all she did was like you, maybe love you.

433
01:06:12,154 --> 01:06:16,614
SHREK: Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature.

434
01:06:16,792 --> 01:06:18,419
I heard the two of you talking.

435
01:06:18,593 --> 01:06:23,428
DONKEY: She wasn't talking about you, she was talking about somebody else.

436
01:06:32,474 --> 01:06:34,942
l'm afraid the eggs are powdered.

437
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:37,135
Obviously you know that.

438
01:06:38,013 --> 01:06:39,207
They're yours.

439
01:06:39,381 --> 01:06:44,375
But l did find bacon, which is about the most fantastic thing in history.

440
01:06:44,553 --> 01:06:48,353
And some antibiotics in the bathroom.

441
01:06:48,523 --> 01:06:50,889
l put by your plate, because your leg is okay...

442
01:06:51,059 --> 01:06:55,257
...but it won't be for very long if you don't start a course soon.

443
01:06:56,565 --> 01:06:58,362
ROBERT: Who are you?

444
01:06:59,835 --> 01:07:02,395
ANNA: l'm Anna and that's Ethan.

445
01:07:09,478 --> 01:07:11,605
Don't let it get cold.

446
01:07:24,526 --> 01:07:27,290
lt's okay. Go on.

447
01:07:52,454 --> 01:07:56,550
We came from Maryland. We heard your message on the radio.

448
01:07:57,259 --> 01:08:00,319
We were at the pier at noon. We waited all day.

449
01:08:02,297 --> 01:08:04,765
We're going to Vermont.

450
01:08:05,434 --> 01:08:08,096
To the survivors' colony.

451
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:10,262
What?

452
01:08:11,206 --> 01:08:14,835
ln Bethel. lt's a safe zone.

453
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:17,478
There's no survivors' colony, there's no safe zones.

454
01:08:17,646 --> 01:08:19,511
Nothing happened the way it was supposed to.

455
01:08:19,848 --> 01:08:21,748
Nothing worked the way it was supposed to.

456
01:08:21,917 --> 01:08:26,513
ln the mountains. There's a whole colony of people there who didn't get sick.

457
01:08:26,688 --> 01:08:29,213
The virus couldn't survive the cold. There's a colony--

458
01:08:29,391 --> 01:08:31,621
ROBERT: Shut up! Shut up!

459
01:08:31,793 --> 01:08:33,226
Everybody's dead.

460
01:08:33,462 --> 01:08:35,521
Everybody is dead.

461
01:08:43,472 --> 01:08:46,566
l just need-- l need a minute. Okay?

462
01:08:48,176 --> 01:08:49,700
Just....

463
01:08:53,615 --> 01:08:56,516
l just-- l was saving that bacon.

464
01:08:58,086 --> 01:08:59,383
l was saving it.

465
01:09:02,224 --> 01:09:04,692
l'm just-- l'm gonna go upstairs. All right? Just--

466
01:09:04,860 --> 01:09:06,885
l'm gonna go.

467
01:09:25,013 --> 01:09:27,641
Ethan, put the knife down.

468
01:10:02,651 --> 01:10:06,587
MAN : You there! Ogre. SHREK: Aye.

469
01:10:06,755 --> 01:10:08,916
MAN: By the order of Lord Farquaad...

470
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:11,490
...I am authorized to place you both under arrest...

471
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:17,462
...and transport you to a designated resettlement facility.

472
01:10:17,632 --> 01:10:22,001
Oh, really? You and what army?

473
01:10:33,281 --> 01:10:34,942
Can l say something to you?

474
01:10:35,116 --> 01:10:38,108
You was really, really something back there. lncredible.

475
01:10:38,453 --> 01:10:40,478
Are you talking to...

476
01:10:41,623 --> 01:10:42,647
...me?

477
01:10:44,092 --> 01:10:47,323
Yes, l was talking to you. You was really great back there.

478
01:10:47,495 --> 01:10:50,726
Those guards, they thought they was all that. You showed up, and bam!

479
01:10:50,899 --> 01:10:53,163
Tripping over themselves like babes in the woods.

480
01:10:53,335 --> 01:10:55,360
That really made me feel good to see that.

481
01:10:55,537 --> 01:10:57,732
That's great. Really. Man, it's good to be free.

482
01:10:58,206 --> 01:11:02,040
Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends?

483
01:11:02,210 --> 01:11:03,700
Hm?

484
01:11:03,878 --> 01:11:05,311
But, uh...

485
01:11:05,547 --> 01:11:07,105
...l don't have any friends.

486
01:11:07,282 --> 01:11:09,750
And l'm not going out there by myself.

487
01:11:09,918 --> 01:11:12,546
Wait a minute. l got a great idea. l'll stick with you!

488
01:11:12,721 --> 01:11:14,484
DONKEY: You a mean, green fighting machine.

489
01:11:14,656 --> 01:11:17,750
Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.

490
01:11:20,996 --> 01:11:22,258
l like Shrek.

491
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:24,864
DONKEY: That was really scary. If you don't mind me saying...

492
01:11:25,033 --> 01:11:27,763
...if that don't work, your breath will get the job done...

493
01:11:27,936 --> 01:11:31,872
...because you definitely need some tic tacs, because your breath stinks!

494
01:11:32,474 --> 01:11:36,501
Man, you almost burned the hair out of my nose. Just like the time....

495
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:41,608
You're not so good with people anymore, are you?

496
01:11:47,055 --> 01:11:49,580
Thank you for my leg.

497
01:11:52,093 --> 01:11:53,856
Okay.

498
01:11:56,931 --> 01:11:58,455
Where have you been?

499
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:02,261
l was on a Red Cross evacuation ship out of Säo Paulo.

500
01:12:02,437 --> 01:12:05,531
Those boats weren't meant to be permanent.

501
01:12:05,707 --> 01:12:07,265
No, they weren't.

502
01:12:07,442 --> 01:12:10,434
When the Navy fell apart, we started docking to take on supplies.

503
01:12:10,612 --> 01:12:14,378
Someone picked it up on shore. Five of us were immune.

504
01:12:14,549 --> 01:12:16,210
You said five?

505
01:12:16,885 --> 01:12:19,251
The Darkseekers got them.

506
01:12:21,623 --> 01:12:24,251
You are the Robert Neville, aren't you?

507
01:12:33,101 --> 01:12:34,466
lt's too late today.

508
01:12:34,636 --> 01:12:37,764
lf we leave tomorrow at dawn, we can make it to Vermont in a straight shot.

509
01:12:37,939 --> 01:12:40,407
-So if you had-- -l'm not leaving.

510
01:12:41,276 --> 01:12:43,608
This is ground zero.

511
01:12:45,046 --> 01:12:47,207
This is my site.

512
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:51,341
l'm not gonna let this happen.

513
01:12:53,521 --> 01:12:55,819
l can still fix this.

514
01:13:00,628 --> 01:13:02,596
What happened to your leg?

515
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:09,196
That's my snare. These are my materials.

516
01:13:09,371 --> 01:13:12,397
The infected didn't do this. They can't.

517
01:13:12,941 --> 01:13:16,240
-How do you know? -They have no higher brain function.

518
01:13:16,411 --> 01:13:21,678
They don't plan or hate. They don't love. They can't.

519
01:13:26,321 --> 01:13:27,879
ANNA: Could they be evolving?

520
01:13:34,295 --> 01:13:36,160
ANNA: Ethan.

521
01:13:39,801 --> 01:13:41,860
Hey, Ethan.

522
01:13:50,278 --> 01:13:51,404
lt's cold.

523
01:14:00,188 --> 01:14:01,212
We gotta go.

524
01:14:03,792 --> 01:14:05,919
ROBERT: l've been cooking the compounds. ANNA: What?

525
01:14:06,094 --> 01:14:08,528
ROBERT: lce. l need ice.

526
01:14:17,005 --> 01:14:21,669
ROBERT: Whoa. You scared me. -Sorry.

527
01:14:21,843 --> 01:14:23,174
l called down twice.

528
01:14:23,344 --> 01:14:26,006
Oh. Oh, thank you.

529
01:14:30,685 --> 01:14:34,280
lt's heavily sedated. Don't worry, it's safe.

530
01:14:34,456 --> 01:14:37,186
l've never seen one so still.

531
01:14:37,792 --> 01:14:40,488
They're always biting.

532
01:14:44,499 --> 01:14:46,831
You think that can cure her?

533
01:14:47,001 --> 01:14:49,936
Um.... No, this will almost certainly kill it...

534
01:14:50,104 --> 01:14:53,335
...but it's possible by drastically reducing the body temperature...

535
01:14:53,508 --> 01:14:56,500
...l can increase the compound's effectiveness.

536
01:15:07,789 --> 01:15:10,087
Did all of them die?

537
01:15:10,325 --> 01:15:11,883
Yes.

538
01:15:14,963 --> 01:15:16,954
ANNA: My God.

539
01:15:17,799 --> 01:15:21,530
God didn't do this, Anna, we did.

540
01:15:26,875 --> 01:15:29,207
Where can Ethan sleep?

541
01:15:47,896 --> 01:15:49,761
He's heavy.

542
01:15:56,271 --> 01:15:58,068
Can you get that?

543
01:16:29,871 --> 01:16:32,169
ANNA: She's beautiful.

544
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,540
What's her name?

545
01:16:36,244 --> 01:16:38,144
Marley.

546
01:16:39,414 --> 01:16:42,975
-Her name was Marley. -lt's a beautiful name.

547
01:16:44,886 --> 01:16:48,913
Yeah. We named her after Bob Marley.

548
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:52,423
-Who? -Uh, the singer.

549
01:16:53,461 --> 01:16:55,190
Damian?

550
01:16:56,464 --> 01:16:58,489
Uh, his father.

551
01:17:01,769 --> 01:17:04,033
His father.

552
01:17:05,106 --> 01:17:06,232
Nope.

553
01:17:06,407 --> 01:17:08,500
I shot the sheriff

554
01:17:11,813 --> 01:17:14,782
But I didn't shoot the deputy

555
01:17:22,290 --> 01:17:27,318
-Oh, that is unacceptable. -What?

556
01:17:31,966 --> 01:17:34,457
Best album ever made.

557
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:41,438
[BOB MARLEY'S ''STlR lT UP'' PLAYS ON STEREO]

558
01:17:43,811 --> 01:17:46,871
-You don't recognize that? -Mm-mm.

559
01:17:48,182 --> 01:17:49,410
Wow.

560
01:17:51,586 --> 01:17:57,149
He had this idea, it was kind of a virologist's idea.

561
01:17:57,325 --> 01:18:01,955
He believed that you could cure racism and hate. Literally cure it...

562
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:08,262
...by injecting music and love into people's lives.

563
01:18:09,103 --> 01:18:12,971
One day, he was scheduled to perform at a peace rally.

564
01:18:13,141 --> 01:18:17,100
Gunmen came to his house and shot him down.

565
01:18:18,946 --> 01:18:20,277
Two days later...

566
01:18:20,915 --> 01:18:24,544
...he walked out on that stage and sang.

567
01:18:26,354 --> 01:18:28,754
Somebody asked him why.

568
01:18:30,558 --> 01:18:33,026
He said, ''The people...

569
01:18:33,194 --> 01:18:38,257
...who are trying to make this world worse are not taking a day off.

570
01:18:39,434 --> 01:18:41,425
How can l?''

571
01:18:44,505 --> 01:18:47,338
Light up the darkness.

572
01:19:13,367 --> 01:19:15,597
Come with us, Neville.

573
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:18,195
To the colony.

574
01:19:21,909 --> 01:19:24,343
There's no colony, Anna.

575
01:19:28,649 --> 01:19:30,173
Everything just fell apart.

576
01:19:30,351 --> 01:19:34,048
-There was no evacuation plan-- -You're wrong. There is a colony.

577
01:19:34,622 --> 01:19:36,647
l know, okay?

578
01:19:38,092 --> 01:19:39,320
How do you know, Anna?

579
01:19:45,833 --> 01:19:46,891
l just know.

580
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:53,300
How? l said, how do you know? How could you know?

581
01:19:55,009 --> 01:19:56,340
God told me.

582
01:19:56,844 --> 01:19:58,835
He has a plan.

583
01:20:00,581 --> 01:20:03,175
-God told you? -Yes.

584
01:20:03,351 --> 01:20:06,081
-The God? -Yes.

585
01:20:07,655 --> 01:20:10,089
-l know how this sounds. -lt sounds crazy.

586
01:20:10,258 --> 01:20:14,058
But something told me to turn on the radio.

587
01:20:14,228 --> 01:20:15,855
Something told me to come here.

588
01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:18,828
My voice on the radio told you to come here, Anna.

589
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,025
You were trying to kill yourself last night?

590
01:20:21,202 --> 01:20:22,191
Anna.

591
01:20:22,370 --> 01:20:25,533
l got here just in time to save your life. That's a coincidence?

592
01:20:25,706 --> 01:20:29,335
-Just stop it. Stop it. Stop. -He must have sent me here for a reason.

593
01:20:30,511 --> 01:20:33,537
Neville, the world is quieter now.

594
01:20:33,714 --> 01:20:35,773
You just have to listen.

595
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:38,111
lf we listen...

596
01:20:38,786 --> 01:20:40,754
...we can hear God's plan.

597
01:20:40,955 --> 01:20:42,980
-God's plan? -Yeah.

598
01:20:43,157 --> 01:20:45,717
All right. Let me tell you about your God's plan.

599
01:20:45,893 --> 01:20:48,794
There were 6 billion people on Earth when the infection hit.

600
01:20:48,963 --> 01:20:53,559
KV had a 90 percent kill rate. That's 5.4 billion...

601
01:20:53,734 --> 01:20:56,202
...people dead.

602
01:20:56,370 --> 01:20:59,203
Crashed and bled out, dead.

603
01:20:59,373 --> 01:21:01,238
Less than 1 percent immunity.

604
01:21:01,409 --> 01:21:05,209
That left 1 2 million healthy people like you, me and Ethan.

605
01:21:05,379 --> 01:21:09,509
The other 588 million...

606
01:21:09,684 --> 01:21:11,675
...turned into your Darkseekers.

607
01:21:11,853 --> 01:21:13,548
And then they got hungry.

608
01:21:13,721 --> 01:21:18,124
And they killed and fed on everybody.

609
01:21:19,293 --> 01:21:21,386
Everybody!

610
01:21:22,096 --> 01:21:27,056
Every single person that you or l has ever known...

611
01:21:27,235 --> 01:21:29,169
...is dead!

612
01:21:31,505 --> 01:21:33,405
Dead!

613
01:21:34,742 --> 01:21:37,472
There is no God. There is no God.

614
01:21:42,783 --> 01:21:44,614
What is that?

615
01:21:47,955 --> 01:21:51,288
Was it still dark when you brought us home last night?

616
01:21:51,459 --> 01:21:54,553
You were bleeding. There was light on the horizon.

617
01:21:56,130 --> 01:21:58,860
Turn the light off. Turn it off.

618
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:07,573
They followed us home.

619
01:22:07,742 --> 01:22:09,403
Ethan.

620
01:22:55,589 --> 01:22:57,250
Shit.

621
01:23:09,971 --> 01:23:11,598
Anna.

622
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:14,937
Anna.

623
01:23:19,714 --> 01:23:21,341
Anna!

624
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,894
Anna!

625
01:23:38,299 --> 01:23:39,891
Anna!

626
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:27,967
Anna?

627
01:25:31,946 --> 01:25:33,675
Anna.

628
01:26:31,539 --> 01:26:33,734
Come on. Come on.

629
01:26:34,775 --> 01:26:36,743
-Are you okay? You all right? ANNA: Yeah.

630
01:26:36,911 --> 01:26:38,435
Are you all right?

631
01:26:39,079 --> 01:26:40,478
-You okay? -Oh, my God. You're bleeding.

632
01:26:54,862 --> 01:26:57,456
Go to the lab. Downstairs, go!

633
01:26:57,731 --> 01:27:00,529
Get to the lab! To the lab!

634
01:27:09,877 --> 01:27:10,901
Get behind the Plexi.

635
01:27:11,745 --> 01:27:13,406
Oh, my God. Come on.

636
01:27:25,993 --> 01:27:27,756
Come on, it's okay. lt's okay.

637
01:27:29,563 --> 01:27:31,326
Oh, my God.

638
01:27:43,811 --> 01:27:45,802
lt's working.

639
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:51,515
Neville...

640
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:54,617
...it's working.

641
01:27:59,927 --> 01:28:01,724
No! Stop! Stop!

642
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:05,328
Look, look, look, l can save you.

643
01:28:05,499 --> 01:28:08,957
l can sa-- l can help you. You are sick and l can help you.

644
01:28:12,072 --> 01:28:14,040
l can-- l can fix this!

645
01:28:14,208 --> 01:28:15,732
l can save everybody!

646
01:28:15,909 --> 01:28:19,140
