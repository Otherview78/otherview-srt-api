"No temptation...

except what is common to mankind.

105
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,490
God is faithful.

106
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:54,951
He will not let you be tempted

107
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,286
beyond what you can bear.

108
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,621
But when you're tempted...

109
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,789
he will also provide a way out

110
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,082
so that you can endure it."

111
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,669

I'm gon' be late.

113
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,673
Where you gotta be that's more important

114
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,216
than being in the House of God?

115
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,220

For drunkards?

119
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,689
Philanderers, who shirk
their responsibilities

120
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:25,857
to their families

121
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,776

Hey, lil' cousin, come on out.

135
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,249
What about the little ones?

136
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,000
Only when they deserve it.

139
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,757
Yeah.

140
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,094
So, tell me about Chicago.

141
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,263
I heard they ain't got
Jim Crow up there.

142
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,224
Black man can go where he wants.

143
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,018
Listen, boy, you can't
be believin' everything

144
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,311

145
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,939
Town'll fill your head up
with this make-believe,

146
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,482
but me and your cousin,

147
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,109
we gon' give it to you straight.

148
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:52,986
Chicago ain't shit

149
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,404
but Mississippi with tall buildings

150
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,822
instead of plantations.

151
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,118
And that's why
we came back home.

152
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,204
Figured we might as well
deal with the devil we know.

153
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,659
Don't move.

154
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,257
How 'bout you leave that truck to us?

155
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,060
Shit. Cracker showin' up late

156
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,603

157
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,314
I'm thinkin' we just set up tonight.

158
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:12,523
Open up next weekend.

159
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,651
Nah, fuck that. It's gotta be tonight.

160
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,527
Grand opening,
start this shit with a bang.

161
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,196
Or we start with a misfire.

162
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,281
Look at that sky.

163
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,952
That's a mighty fine day
to be free, ain't it?

164
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,287
Our own juke joint.

165
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,790
For us, and by us.

166
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,750
Just like we always wanted.

167
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,339
Only chance we got if we split up.

168
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,299
Well, who gon' watch the truck

169
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,509
while I'm in there talking to the Chows?

170
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:40,843
Nigga, just let 'em see it's you.

171
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,220
We've been gone a long time, Stack.

172
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,472
Seven years ain't long enough
to forget about us.

173
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,474
All right.

174
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,602
Watch this fool. Make sure
he don't get in no trouble.

175
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,854
You big enough to take me now, huh?

176

I'll do what I can.

177
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,440
Nah, you'll do what you told.

178
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,610
You keep your eyes open
for anybody staring too long.

179
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,612
This nigga don't know how
to watch his own back.

180
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,782
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

181
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,450
- Be careful.
- I will.

182
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,414
You with me.

183
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,480
Hey, little girl.

184
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,316
Come here.

185
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,153
Where you from?

186
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,321
Shelby.

187
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,906
You heard of the Smokestack Twins?

188
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,157
Of course.

189
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,409
Good. I'm Smoke.

190
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,621
No, no, no, now.
You're not in no trouble.

191
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,873
See, I'm trying to put
some money in your pocket.

192
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,710
See, I'mma need you to come
sit in this truck right here.

193
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,297
And if somebody come
and look a little too long...

194
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,091
I want you to lean
on this horn, all right?

195
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,258
Can you do that for me?

196
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,844
Can you tell time?

197
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,138
I'mma pay you ten cents

198
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,515
for every minute that I'm gone.

199
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,142
- Will that work for you?
- Yes, sir.

200
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,435
No, ma'am.

201
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,354
See, we talkin' numbers now.

202
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:59,440
And numbers always gotta be in
conversation with each other.

203
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,650
You understand?

204
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,443
You gotta negotiate.

205
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,530
Now, ten cents just won't work for you.

206
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,740
Talk another number back to me.

207
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,283
Fitty cent.

208
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,786
Twenty cents. Best I can do.

209
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,454
We got a deal?

210
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,081
Good. Jump in.

211
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,421
Remember, lean on that horn.

212
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,069
You not little Lisa, is you?

213
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,654
Guilty as charged.

214
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:47,822
- Mornin', Sarah.
- Mornin'!

215
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,116
- Your daddy here?
- Daddy!

216
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,034
What?

217
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,662
Bo Chow.

218
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,998
Look what the damn cat dragged in.

219
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,170
What can I do for you?

220
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,546
We throwin' a big event tonight.

221
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:04,714
- What do you need?
- I need catfish

222
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:05,882
for a hundred people.

223
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,049
Y'all do good up in Chicago?

224
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,342
I heard about some of them

225
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:09,677
casinos up there. Y'all hit it big?

226
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,516
We hit. Just not the way you thinking.

227
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,268
What kind of way?

228
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,188
Shit.

229
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,112
- They stealin'!
- Mm-hm.

230
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,405
Watch my fingers, fool.

231
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,948
I'm trying to make sure
they ain't watchin' that shit.

232
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,116
Man, just get
your own damn thing, bro.

233
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,868
- I'm trying to help you.
- Watch it, man.

234
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,412
Fuck you going, nigger?

235
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,747
Bet this bullet'll beat you there.

236
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,709
You shot me. Mother...

237
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:45,630
Smoke.

238
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,424
Terry? Boy, how you been?

239
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,801
I was doin' better
'fore you shot me in the ass.

240
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,386
Why in the hell you trying
to boost from my truck?

241
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,763
This your truck?

242
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,389
I didn't know it was your truck.

243
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,557
- I swear, Smoke.
- Bullshit.

244
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,725
I told you it was his.

245
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,393
Wait, wait, Smoke. I thought,
I thought she was lyin'.

246
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,896
Y'all was supposed to be
in Chicago workin' for Capone.

247
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,149
Yeah, we back now.

248
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,576
Goddamn! What you do that for?

249
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,078
Can't have some nigga talkin' about

250
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,871
how he almost robbed the Twins.

251
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,122
Not without a limp to show for it.

252
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,832
- Well, who gon' patch me up?
- Shit!

253
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,000
I ain't got no money.

254
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,919
What if I get sepsis
or some shit in the ass?

255
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,004
Y'all scoot on out the street.
Put some pressure on it.

256
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,217
- Get up, boy.
- Nigga, I need help!

257
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,219
Get up, fool.
Get out the street.

258
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:36,806
Doc Teddy still live 'round here?

259
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:37,974
Yeah.

260
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,559
I just shot a couple niggas outside.

261
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,812
If they gon' live, they gon'
need some patching up.

262
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,522
Yeah, we can take care of that.

263
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:45,690
Anything else?

264
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,068
Yeah, we gon' need a sign too.

265
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,820
You think Grace'd be
up to making us one?

266
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:52,488
When would you need it done?

267
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,781
Tonight.

268
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,117
Lisa. Go get your mama.

269
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,998
<i>Y'all gon' have food, drink, music.</i>

270
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,332
<i>Is y'all gon' be playing?</i>

271
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,586
<i>You say. Cards, dice,
even got a roulette.</i>

272
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,387
Do nothing
but shoot each other up.

273
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:17,555
Glory be,

274
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,141
I have no animosity towards
colored folk, but if they...

275
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,727
Mama, Daddy wants you.

276
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

277
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,567

00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:30,735

279
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,542
I can't feel my leg,

280
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,544
I'm gonna have to hop all around town!

281
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,296
Oh, yeah.

00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,048
We definitely oughta try bring him.

283
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,468
You know, there's two men out there.

284
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:56,886
Look like they been shot.

285
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,054
That'll be my doin'.

286
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,221
I done already gave Bo the money

287
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,473
to get 'em patched up.

288
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,433
Why you gotta come here
bringin' trouble?

289
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,435
Trouble ain't all he bringing.

290
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,020

Twenty.

296
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,614
Fifteen for the front door
sign and five for the menu.

297
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:17,782
Ten. Seven for the front door sign,

298
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:18,949
three for the menu.

299
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,242
- Sixteen.
- Fifteen.

300
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,410
Done.

301
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,704
Oh. We only got one color, by the way.

302
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,749
What color you got?

303
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,250
Red.

304
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,836
- Thirteen.

305
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,967
Fourteen. Throw in these

306
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,177

307
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:40,096
Done.

308
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,182
Where's Stack?

309
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:44,517
All right, listen.

310
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,060
Every cooze got a button on it,

311
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:47,228
towards the top.

312
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,231
If you wanna keep a woman,
you find it...

313
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,066
Lick that.

314
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,027
Not too hard. Not too soft, either.

315
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,154
You ever had a scoop of
that ice cream from downtown?

316
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,364
Uh-huh.

317
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,865
'Bout the same pressure you put on that.

318
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,534
Like it taste good,

319
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,119
but you don't want it gone
too quickly, you understand?

320
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,414
Hey, how fast this thing drive?

321
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:07,915
Too damn fast.

322
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,875
Why? You wanna drive?

323
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,043
Come on, you know I wanna drive.

324
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,212
Later. On the way back.

325
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,672
- On the way back.
- All right, all right.

326
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,175
You always said you would tell me

327
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,094
what happened to your daddy
when I got older.

328
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,763
Well, I guess I'm older.

329
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,476
Y'all really kill him?

330
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,567
Nah, we ain't kill him.

331
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,111
Smoke did.

332
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,281
Our daddy knocked me unconscious.

333
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,366
By the time I came to,

334
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,909
Smoke was halfway done bur yin' him.

335
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,036
He used to beat y'all?

336
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,204
Me, mostly.

337
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,123
But he ain't mean it.

338
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,044
See you been takin'
good care of that thing.

339
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,923
Hey, I can't thank y'all
enough for this.

340
00:20:58,716 --> 00:20:59,717
Plays so right.

341
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:01,677
Where'd I get this from anyway?

342
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,598
Yeah, that's, uh,
Charley Patton's guitar.

343
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,808
Me and my brother
won it off him in a card game.

344
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,143
Hold on, Stack.

345
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,604
You mean to tell me

346
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:12,813
I had Charley Patton's guitar
this whole time?

347
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,981
Swear 'fore God,

348
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,149
- in your hands.
- Nah.

349
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:16,484
Now let's see
if you can play like him.

350
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,651
- Right here?
- Yeah, right now. Come on.

351
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,653
All right. Come on. Watch this.

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,180
- Thanks, Twin.
- Yep.

362
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,226
Oh. Is that Delta Slim?

363
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,903
Delta Slim.

364
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,909
Yeah, I thank you for your generosity.

365
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,500
I guess that Chicago wind

366
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,587
blew your Black asses
back down here, huh?

367
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:02,673
Who the boy?

368
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,426
This my little cousin.
Preacherboy Sammie.

369
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:09,555
Happens to be the finest
blues player in all the Delta.

370
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,266
I got socks older than this here boy.

371
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:16,478
What the hell he know about the blues?

372
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,484
I can show you
better than I can tell you.

373
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,737
Hold up, now.
Put that motherfucker...

374
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:25,905
Put that away.

375
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,072
Get, get.

376
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,574
Now, this here my patch right here.

377
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,243
Now, you wasn't his cousin
and a young pup to boot,

378
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,495
I'd cut your ass too thin to fry.

379
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,705
And you threaten him again,

380
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,332
I'mma make your drunk ass
swallow that harmonica.

381
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,086
You still nice with them keys?

382
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:42,838
Depend on who you ask.

383
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:48,052
I'll give you $20 to come play
at our juke tonight.

384
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,429
Yeah, I wish I could.

385
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,473
I'mma be at Messenger's tonight,

386
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,600
same as I am every Saturday night.

387
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,310
What they pay you?

388
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:57,937
For a gangster,

389
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,104
you sure ask a lot of questions.

390
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,565
They ain't paying you
$20 a night, I know that.

391
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:03,400
You ain't paying no $20 a night.

392
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,196
You pa yin' $20, maybe, tonight.

393
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,741
I ain't never heard of your juke.

394
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:14,536
Maybe it's here tonight,
is it here tomorrow night?

395
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,288
The week after that? Nah.

396
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,749
I been at Messenger's
every Saturday night

397
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:19,917
for the last ten years.

398
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:21,669
Messenger's gon' be there

399
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,587
another ten years after that, at least.

400
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,173
Shit.

401
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,425
That's probably more time than I got

402
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,719
left on this earth, Stack.

403
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:34,515
I play, and I get as much
corn liquor as I can drink.

404
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,559
A sinner like me,

405
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,727
I can't ask for more than that.

406
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,815
Know what, Slim? I'll drink to that.

407
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,993
Ooh.

408
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,578
What you got there, boy?

409
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,456
Oh, this? It's a Irish beer.

410
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,875
Straight from the north side of Chicago.

411
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,338
You ea yin' that's beer?

412
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,799
Wind didn't bring us
down here empty-handed.

413
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,678
Give me that.

414
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,481
My goodness.

415
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,984
I got 500 more bottles just like that.

416
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,193
Ice cold.

417
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:30,779
Say we pay you $40 a night.

418
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,531
And all the beer that you can drink.

419
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:33,907
After that, no strings.

420
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,409
You act now,

421
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,453
I'll even let you finish
that bottle in your hand.

422
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,457
Ha!

423
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:49,757
Ha!

424
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,551
These two gon' be playin'
down at the old sawmill.

425
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,928
It's the grand openin' of our new joint.

426
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,805
Club Juke.

427
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,475
We gon' have us a battle of the blues.

428
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,811
It's gon' be a real ring-a-ding-ding.

429
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,104
Just for us.

430
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,122
- Y'all ready to eat?
- Yeah!

431
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,124
- Y'all ready to drank?
- Yeah!

432
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,876
Y'all ready to sweat
till y'all stank?

433
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:27,044
Yeah.

434
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,296
All right.

435
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:31,215
We gon' get funky like
a Mississippi donkey, y'all.

436
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,052
Get a drink on the Twins
when you get there.

437
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,303
I like it.
Where you get that one from?

438
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,471
What I'm ea yin', now.

439
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:38,722
Gotta do what you gotta do.

440
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:39,890
You gotta.

441
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,392
I've seen you somewhere before.

442
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,186
Maybe.

443
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,105
You sing, don't you?

444
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:48,982
- Time to time.
- Mm-hmm.

445
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,442
I'm Preacherboy.

446
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,281
Pearline.

447
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,826
Pearline. Mm.

448
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:00,994
I'm married, by the way.

449
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:02,496
Happily?

450
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,331
Careful, boy.

451
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,167
You gon' bite off
more than you can chew.

452
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,463
Maybe I'll see you tonight.

453
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:19,805
Then we'll take it from there.

454
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:20,973
I'mma hold you
to that, now.

455
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,141
It's gonna be a night
you never forget.

456
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,308
Hey, let me
go see about my money.

457
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,476
Hey, go on and get your money.

458
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,770
Hey, hey, hey. There's a white
woman staring at you.

459
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,064
Shit.

460
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,066
Uh, you sure she white?

461
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,027
She walkin' over here right now.

462
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,195
All right, now here's
what we're gonna do...

463
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,322
Excuse me, boy. Is this here Smoke?

464
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,825
Or is this Stack?

465
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,034
Don't, don't look at her.

466
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,786
Just go over there and keep playing.

467
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,705
Yeah, it's okay.

468
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,710
- You know I waited for you.
- Yeah, well,

469
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:50,961
I don't know why in the hell
you'd go and do that.

470
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,337
Because you told me you loved me.

471
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,047
Yeah, well, I told you to stay
the fuck away from me, too,

472
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,424
but I guess you didn't hear that part.

473
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:56,592
I heard you.

474
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,760
I heard you loud and clear,

475
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,137
but then you stuck your tongue
in my cooze

476
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:01,597
and fucked me so hard,

477
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,890
I figured you changed your mind.

478
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,183
Keep your voice down, now.

479
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,476
It's not exactly how I remember it.

480
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,145
Oh, it ain't? Remember falling asleep

481
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,354
with your head on my chest?

482
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,772
Leaving in the middle of the night

483
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:11,940
without a fucking word?

484
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,817
The hell are you doing back here, Mary?

485
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,404
I buried my mama yesterday, Stack.

486
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,824
Figured I might see you and Smoke there,

487
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,367
as much as she looked after you both.

488
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,535
But I guess y'all love lasted

489
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,828
as long as y'all could
get something out of her.

490
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,372
You right. That's all she was.

491
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,334
Food, a warm bed.

492
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,795
Rot in hell, Stack.

493
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,547
Shit, I will.

494
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,636
You know, and save
your triflin' ass a room.

495
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:44,014
Shit, right next to me. Shit.

496
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,182
Hey, Stack.

497
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,392
Hm?

498
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:49,478
Maybe she ain't white.

499
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,563
Boy, let's get to gettin'.

500
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,773
Come on, Slim.

501
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,191
Still got one more stop to make.

Hey, you knew some of them?

513
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,270
All of 'em.

514
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,690
What happened?

515
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,363
Me and my buddy Rice...

516
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,242
we was hustlin' back and forth
up the Delta.

517
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:47,327
We get busted for vagrancy.

518
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,622
Them white sheriffs
take us down to the jailhouse

519
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,790
and it's empty.

520
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,168
Thought for sure
they gon' kill us that night.

521
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:58,547
They give us our instruments back,

522
00:29:58,714 --> 00:29:59,923
they tell us to play.

523
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,258
Stack, we played,

524
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:02,926
Preacherboy, we played, you hear me?

525
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,387
Music was comin' out the windows.

526
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,307
Peoples on the street
were stoppin' to come on in.

527
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:11,393
Next day, one of them sheriffs,

528
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,561
they get the bright idea

529
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,104
they gonna take us on the road now.

530
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,690
They cover us,
throw us in the paddy wagon.

531
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,027
They took us to this big house.

532
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:23,363
I mean, it's full of white folks.

533
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,741
Pass around their hat
and have us to play.

534
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,617
See, these white folks
we were playing for,

535
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,578
they had real money.

536
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,331
Had y'all playing them
old ragtime songs?

537
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,832
I sure was.

538
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,585
We play a fair amount of blues, too.

539
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,962
See, white folks,
they like the blues just fine.

540
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:40,881
They just don't like
the people who make it.

541
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,092
Them peckerwoods
was noddin' their heads,

542
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,260
stompin' their feet.

543
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,555
Some of 'em was almost
on the rhythm, Stack.

544
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,017
And then Rice and me,
we changed it up, confuse 'em.

545
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,229
What did y'all do with the money?

546
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,024
I drank it.

547
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,903
Rice said he was gonna
take that money...

548
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,238
go on out to Little Rock,
start him a little church.

549
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,406
Did he?

550
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,494
The damn fool.

551
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,413
He took out all his money to pay

552
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,166
for the $2 train ticket.

553
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,334
Train conductor saw him...

554
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,585
<i>That Black sumbitch right there.</i>

555
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,462
- ...Klan got a hold to him.
<i>- Pull him over here!</i>

556
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,631
Searched his pockets,
found all that money.

557
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,633
Made up a story about him...

558
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,926
killin' some white man for it

559
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,177
and rapin' that white man's wife.

560
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:28,678
<i>That boy's a murderer.</i>

561
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:29,846
And they lynched him

562
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,181
right there in the railroad station.

563
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,682
<i>No!</i>

564
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,771
And you know, they cut off his manhood.

565
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,499
Got that guitar in your hand,
don't you, boy?

566
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:01,002
Hey. Yeah, come on now.

567
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,796
Hey!

568
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,568
Hey, Cornbread!

569
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:27,904
Ooh.

570
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,699
Stack? Boy, long time no see.

571
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,160
This here my wife, Therise.

572
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,537
Nice to meet you, Therise.

573
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:36,830
Likewise.

574
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:40,083
Need you to give us a moment.
Men got business to discuss.

575
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,170
No, uh-uh. I ain't got time
for your schemin', Stack.

576
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,629
Behind on my quota.

577
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,339
Man, fuck your quota.

578
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,342
This my wife right here, now.

579
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,969
I'mma need you to show some respect.

580
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,721
Yeah, well, fuck your wife, too.

581
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,017
What's that?

582
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,351
I said she really gonna
let you fuck her

583
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,811
when she find out how much money

584
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,563
you about to get
from this job I'm offering.

585
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,064
And none of that nice-and-slow shit

586
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,399
she probably giving you now.

587
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,735
Shit, she might even let you
put your pecker in her mouth.

588
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,198
Boy, you shoulda stayed gone,

589
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,033
'cause I'm about to
beat the black off of you.

590
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,910
- Come on now!
- I don't want no trouble! Hey!

591
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,121
Well, how much money

592
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,666
Oh, that's a good woman.

593
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:23,418
Come on.

594
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,669
We be back.

595
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,097
Papa's here.

596
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,684
Yeah. Papa's here.

597
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,413
How you be?

598
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,583
No miseries worth complaining about.

599
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,965
You come alone?

600
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,388
Yeah. Stack on the other side of town.

601
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,225
What you come back for?

602
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,355
We bought that old saw mill.

603
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:11,651
Yeah, we gon' patch it up,
make it into a juke joint.

604
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,236
A juke joint.

605
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,823
This one of Stack's ideas?

606
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,159
Yeah, he figure tonight
gonna be a grand opening.

607
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,161
I thought y'all was done with the Delta.

608
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,538
Last I heard, y'all were northern men.

609
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,582
Nah, we through with Chicago.

610
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,250
Chicago through with y'all?

611
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:29,794
What you asking?

612
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,504
Who you and Stack robbed

613
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,465
to get enough money for them crackers

614
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:34,924
to sell you a whole mill?

615
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,942
Just this, Miss Annie.

616
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,278
And a pinch of High John.

617
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,571
All right.

618
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,783
Now, don't sell none of this
on the way home.

619
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,369
I don't want your mama
comin' at me crazy later.

620
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,745
Yes, ma'am.

621
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,205
Thank you.

622
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,002
I can't believe you taking
this make-believe shit.

623
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,463
Smoke, give me my money
'fore I cut your Black ass.

624
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,215
You can put that blade up, woman.

625
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,260
- I'll trade ya.
- I don't want your money.

626
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,179
- Don't be stupid, now.
- I ain't stupid.

627
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,347
Your money come with blood.

628
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,765
All money come with blood, baby.

629
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:24,974
Not like yours.

630
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,393
This shit won't even spend nowhere else.

631
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,977
- Look at it.
- I ain't goin' nowhere else.

632
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,271
I don't need that cursed money you got.

633
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,445
You know, woman,
I been all over this world.

634
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:43,284
In cars. Ships. Trains.

635
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:49,332
I seen men die ways I didn't
even know was possible.

636
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:54,421
I ain't never saw no roots, no demons...

637
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,590
no ghosts, no magic.

638
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,302
Just power.

639
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:05,098
And only money can get you that.

640
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,142
You fool.

641
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,352
All that war.

642
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,188
Or whatever the hell else
you been doin' in Chicago.

643
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,275
And you back here in front of me.

644
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,571
Two arms, two legs, two eyes,
and a brain that work.

645
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,282
How you know I ain't pray...

646
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,118
and work every root
my grand mama taught me

647
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:27,787
to keep you and that
crazy brother of yours safe

648
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,789
every day since you been gone?

649
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,588
So why those roots ain't work
on our baby, then?

650
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,302
I don't know.

651
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,848
But they work for you.

652
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,694
You still got that mojo bag.

653
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,104
Soil of my soil...

654
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:38,358
bone of my bone, blood of my blood.

655
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:39,526
I bless you.

656
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:41,903
Ashe.

657
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,630
Why you here, Smoke?

658
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,675
What you want with me?

659
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,429
We was hopin' to serve food
at the juke tonight.

660
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,225
We want you to cook for us.

661
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,186
Elijah.

662
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,318
You gonna make me say it?

663
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,699
It still hurts coming back here.

664
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,203
But I love ya.

665
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:36,291
And I miss ya.

666
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:51,718
Help!

667
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,052
Back up.

668
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,679
Y'all gotta help.

669
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:57,765
I thought I could trust them,
but they tried to kill me.

670
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,392
- Slow down.
- Who's tr yin' to kill you?

671
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:00,601
Choctaw.

672
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,061
Sure it wasn't just
some fair-skinned niggers?

673
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,480
Ain't no Injuns around here for miles.

674
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,442
Oh, God.

675
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,615
They took my wife. Oh, God.

676
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,326
I'm a coward, ain't I?

677
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,335
I got gold.

678
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,547
Them dirty Injuns meant to rob me.

679
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:32,383
They ain't get all of it.
Y'all can have it.

680
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,218
Just don't let 'em hurt me no more.

681
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:01,996
Evening, ma'am.

682
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:07,335
We're in pursuit
of someone very dangerous.

683
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:09,629
He might've come onto your property.

684
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,923
Have you seen anyone recently?

685
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,549
No.

686
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,427
Bert!

687
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,763
Is he in there with you, ma'am?

688
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:23,434
He's not what he seems.

689
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:27,021
God forbid you let him into your home.

690
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:30,399
And if so, we need to act now.

691
00:43:58,928 --> 00:43:59,929
Bert.

692
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,932
Injuns came and went.

693
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:05,726
Bert?

694
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,571
Bert?

695
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:25,079
Bert?

696
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:30,835
Oh, he's just resting.

697
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,140
He's all better now.

698
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,267
Hey, baby.

699
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,354
Don't cry.

700
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:01,407
Don't fall now.

701
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:04,535
To the right.

702
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:05,745
A little more.

703
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:07,872
Oh, shit.

704
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:14,170
Right this way. Ladies.

705
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,256
Come on in!
Welcome to Club Juke.

706
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:19,508
We about to get it poppin'

707
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:33,272
We got whiskey,
Irish beer, Italian wine.

708
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,899
Y'all some classy niggas, ain't you?

709
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,943
Too fancy for me.

710
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,986
Ma'am, I don't need no ice or nothin'.

711
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:40,613
Corn liquor'll do.

712
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,114
That'll be 50 cent.

713
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,158
God damn, I just got 30.

714
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:47,453
But these is good down

715
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:51,540
- You like that cold, right?
- I certainly do.

716
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,125
Comin' right up.

717
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,127
I thank you kindly.

718
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,255
Let me holla at y'all right quick.

719
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,467
- Good evenin'.
- Evenin'.

720
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:02,927
You look mighty nice.

721
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,303
Thank you.

722
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,554
You made it.

723
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:11,894
This ain't no house party.

724
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,813
And it damn sure ain't no charity.

725
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,691
We takin' cash,
U.S. motherfuckin' dollars.

726
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,109
This ain't Chicago, Smoke.

727
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,485
The fuck that mean?

728
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:20,820
That old nigga worked his ass off

729
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,071
for them wooden nickels.

730
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,782
<i>See, these niggas been
workin' in the field all day.</i>

731
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,285
<i>When they show up here,
let them enjoy themselves.</i>

732
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,704
<i>They gotta feel wanted
if you want this here to work.</i>

733
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,831
<i>This place supposed
to feel like it's for them.</i>

734
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,040
Right this way.

735
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:34,875
Uh-huh.

736
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,752
Uh...

737
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,754
Excuse me, ma'am.

738
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,798
You sure you at the right place?

739
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:43,301
That's a damn good question, Cornbread.

740
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,344
Little Mary?

741
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,221
Not so little no more, huh?

742
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,307
Little Mary. Aw.

743
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,517
When they turn
this place into a juke?

744
00:46:51,684 --> 00:46:53,477
We did it today.
My cousins own it.

745
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,895
You know the Twins.

746
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,523
Heard of 'em, of course.

747
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,025
They your cousins?

748
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,485
Y'all must be play cousins.

749
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,487
Their daddy was my daddy big brother.

750
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:05,906
So y'all cousins through blood?

751
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,410
But you seem like such a nice young man.

752
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:11,162
I ain't always nice.

753
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,414
Ain't that young, either.

754
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,630
My condolences about your mother.

755
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,091
We'd have made the repast...

756
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,635
but me and Therise had to work.

757
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,095
It's all right.

758
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,349
Now let me get on in here
and get a drink

759
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,516
before I start tearing up.

760
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,185
Go on. Enjoy yourself.

761
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,690
- You got my $2?
- Huh?

762
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,902
When you was sellin' ass
out in Little Rock...

763
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:45,112
you ever let a john pay with
a goddamn promissory note?

764
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:46,322
Hell no.

765
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:51,243
But, see, I wasn't sellin' ass
in the Delta.

766
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,620
You gon' play?

767
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:53,913
You gon' sing?

768
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,291
We'll see where the night takes us.

769
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,878
Your husband coming?

770
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,301
Shit.

771
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:08,469
Hold on.

772
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:12,348
Excuse me, ma'am.

773
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,141
I don't think you should be here.

774
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,643
You see, I'm with the Twins...

775
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:16,811
With the Twins?

776
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,021
Boy, if you don't
get the fuck out my face...

777
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,398
I am with them, ma'am.

778
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,316
We met earlier at the train station.

779
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:23,484
I'm their lil' cousin.

780
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:25,403
Little cousin?

781
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,446
I think you should leave
before they see you.

782
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,365
Wait, you not little Sammie?

783
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,534
The guitar.

784
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,203
You old enough to drink now?

785
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:36,622
Come on, let me buy you a drink.

786
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,584
- Hey, Mary.
- Grace.

787
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:41,752
Good to see ya.

788
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,671
- Two whiskeys, please.
- Sure.

789
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:45,005
I don't know hoodoo,

790
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,383
and I can't talk slick,
but I know business.

791
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:50,052
And this is bad for business.

792
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:51,303
It's opening night.

793
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,597
Besides, only be a few of 'em like this.

794
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,019
I need a goddamn cigarette.

795
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:00,229
Comin' right up.

796
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,440
So you play that guitar they left you?

797
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,067
- Yeah.
- That's good.

798
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,111
You makin' any money with that thing?

799
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,824
Not really. Not yet, at least.

800
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,660
I'd tell ya it didn't matter
as long as you love it,

801
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:16,454
but that'd be horseshit advice.

802
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,209
Hey, what are you?

803
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:25,546
What am I?

804
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:28,174
I'm a human being.

805
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,385
Oh. That ain't what I meant.
I meant, more like...

806
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:32,678
I know what you meant.

807
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,932
My mama's daddy was half Black.

808
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,769
He raised her to keep
the Klan from killing her.

809
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,939
You know my mama delivered the Twins?

810
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,941
Really?

811
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,109
She saved Stack life

812
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:48,444
after he got stuck in their mama.

813
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:49,612
And after she died,

814
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,405
my mama nursed them
like they was her own.

815
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,539
And they had enough money
to buy this whole mill...

816
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:03,209
and they ain't even
send flowers to her funeral.

817
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:07,254
We sent your mama flowers.
Plenty of 'em.

818
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,049
All while she still alive to smell 'em.

819
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,344
- Smoke.
- Mary.

820
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,138
Why don't you go check in on Slim?

821
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,681
See if he'll need backup.

822
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,117
Take care of her or I will.

823
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,119
No, no, I'mma handle it. I got it.

824
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,496
- All right, go on.
- I'm goin'.

825
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,583
Come on. Let's go.

826
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,877
- I'm not here for you.
- Then why you here, then?

827
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,339
I come to hear the blues.

828
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:51,799
Oh, no, they play the blues
just fine in Arkansas.

829
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:52,967
Come on.

830
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,176
Cornbread, let's get her a car.

831
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:55,344
Get your hands off me.

832
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:57,805
What's it gon' take?

833
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,766
Hm? How much to get you
to get the fuck on?

834
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:02,184
You can't pay me off.

835
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,687
Fine. I'll pay one of these
field bitches in here...

836
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:05,854
to drag your ass out, then.

837
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,606
Shit. You taught me how to fight.

838
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,316
I'll beat up every bitch
in here and you know it.

839
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,527
I taught you how to walk away
when the money is up, too.

840
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:13,779
Got you a rich white husband.

841
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:15,406
Got you a farm. Now go home to it.

842
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:17,032
I ain't ask for none of that.

843
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,536
All that shit was your idea.
I didn't want no white man.

844
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,788
I didn't wanna be white.
I wanted to be with you.

845
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:25,165
All it'd take is the wrong
person in here to see you...

846
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,334
word get back to them crackers
and they gon' try to kill you.

847
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,544
Would it matter to you?

848
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:32,131
'Cause if somebody out there
put their hands on you...

849
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:33,882
if they hurt you...

850
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,010
me and my brother
gon' come kill 'em all.

851
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,761
So you'll kill for me.

852
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:39,305
That's right.

853
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:42,975
But you still won't tell me the truth.

854
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,312
I was young enough to believe
you were comin' back.

855
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:51,859
I waited. I waited a long time.

856
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,196
But I'm grown now, Stack.

857
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,782
And I know you never planned to stay.

858
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,328
Why can't you just say that?

859
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,787
Say what?

860
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:06,040
Hm?

861
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,296
That I love you?

862
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,927
That I think about you every day?

863
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,475
I just wanted to keep you
someplace safe.

864
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:28,270
And that was never gon' be here.

865
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,650
And that was never gon' be with me.

866
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:35,819
Never.

867
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,072
All right.

868
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:22,700
Yeah.

869
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,284
Hey...

870
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:31,500
I been hearin' about this one
particular young man all day.

871
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:35,003
He 'posed to be a bad blues man.

872
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,882
Preacherboy, where you at?

873
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,259
Come on here, man.

874
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,811
That's my little cousin, y'all.
Watch this.

875
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,941
Hold up, hold up.

876
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,486
Tell 'em who you are, where you from.

877
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,993
I'm Sammie Moore.

878
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,704
- All right.
- Come on, now.

879
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:12,833
I'm a sharecropper
from Sunflower plantation.

880
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,879
They call me Preacherboy

881
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,297
account of my daddy being a pastor.

882
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,507
- All right, now.
- Amen.

883
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,468
I wrote this song for him.

884
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:23,677

949
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,888
Hold on. I wanna try something.

950
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,766
Wait.

951
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,601
Preacherboy...

952
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:08,146
let me wash up first. I walked here.

953
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:10,816
You're beautiful.

954
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,652
I just wanna taste you.

955
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,750
Shit.

956
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:37,259
Excuse me. How y'all doin'?

957
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:40,387
Good? Havin' another drink?
All right now.

958
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:44,891
Shit.

959
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:48,145
Hey.

960
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,646
Preacherboy.

961
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,235
Boy found that button, didn't he?

962
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:57,279
Hey. Smoke wants ya.

963
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:58,864
Check out my little cousin.

964
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,873
He call himself,
tellin' me about the cotton.

965
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:11,793
I said, "Shit... that boy
don't know nothin'..."

966
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,886
Get the Twins. Go on. Get 'em.

967
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:22,679
I tallied the till.

968
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,142
And? What's the count?

969
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:33,148
Now, that top figure,
that's plantation money.

970
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:37,360
That bottom figure, that's real dollars.

971
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,864
So what's the projection?

972
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:43,450
Two months, and we out of fresh cash.

973
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,661
- Hey there.
- Good evening.

974
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:48,455
How may I help you folks?

975
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:50,832
Oh, we heard tell of a party.

976
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:54,085
Drink, food, blues music and the like.

977
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:55,670
You did?

978
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:57,547
We like to drink.

979
01:01:58,173 --> 01:02:01,134
We happen to be musicians,
and we walked here.

980
01:02:01,301 --> 01:02:03,887
So, we hungry as dogs.

981
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:05,889
Woof woof.

982
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:08,975
You wouldn't mind us
comin' in, now, would you?

983
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,020
I think y'all
in the wrong place.

984
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,606
What makes ya say that?

985
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,073
You fellers must be the owners

986
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,407
of this establishment.

987
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,409
That's right. And you are?

988
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,746
Name's Remmick.
This here's Joan and Bert.

989
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:31,623
Hey, Stack, y'all all right?

990
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:34,084
Oh. And you...

991
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:37,462
must be that voice
I heard from out here.

992
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:40,423
It was beautiful.

993
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,175
Goddamn beautiful voice.

994
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:43,927
Even through these walls.

995
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:46,304
Mm.

996
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:48,473
Where y'all from?

997
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,766
Just down the road.

998
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,059
And how far is that?

999
01:02:51,226 --> 01:02:52,227
North Carolina.

1000
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:54,521
- Y'all Klan?
- Sir...

1001
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,733

1002
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,945
And music. We just came here to play.

1003
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,447

You don't need to do that, sir.

1037
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:29,991

Yeah, well,
crackers at nighttime

1043
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:55,600
- will do that to you.
- Wasn't just that.

1044
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:57,685
You think they brought company?

1045
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:58,895
I doubt it.

1046
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,022
But we got enough pepper
on us if they did.

1047
01:05:01,189 --> 01:05:02,857
Shit, we forgot the trunk.

1048
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,025
Man, why ain't you remind me?

1049
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:06,027
Fool, I told you to remind me.

1050
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:09,197
Y'all don't need the trunk.
There was just three of 'em.

1051
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:11,324
Now listen to me,

1052
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:13,326
what if they just came to sing?

1053
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:15,412
And what if somebody
spill somethin' on 'em?

1054
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,830
Step on their shoe?

1055
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:18,498
Look at their woman a bit too long?

1056
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:21,084
We gon' have a bigger problem
than just a fight.

1057
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,252
Sure do.

1058
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,421
Don't let them in.

1059
01:05:47,068 --> 01:05:48,194
They said you wanna talk.

1060
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:49,362
Yeah.

1061
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:50,572
Seen your performance down there.

1062
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,115
Pretty damn good.

1063
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,326
Can't thank you enough for this.

1064
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,038
I mean, y'all the ones who
put that guitar in my hand.

1065
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:00,832
Now this.

1066
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:04,002
Well, you got the talent.
That's for certain.

1067
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,713
But all this ain't no life for nobody.

1068
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:10,383
I know plenty musicians.
I ain't never met a happy one.

1069
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:12,385
Yeah, it's cute now.

1070
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,930
But it get old. That ramblin'.

1071
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:17,765
I mean, being with y'all today...

1072
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:21,895
Smoke, I feel like I'm flying.

1073
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,272
Well, today settled it.

1074
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:26,441
I'm headin' off on my own.

1075
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:27,984
Where you goin'?

1076
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:29,444
I don't know.

1077
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:33,448
- Maybe Chicago.
- Hm.

1078
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:34,741
<i>What's wrong, Stack?</i>

1079
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:35,950
We underwater.

1080
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,118
How?

1081
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:40,580
All the plantations down there
pa yin' with credits.

1082
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:44,083
What about them crackers?

1083
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:45,251
What about 'em?

1084
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,504
I can go feel 'em out
before they're too far gone.

1085
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,422
I could feel 'em out myself.

1086
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:52,300
They'll tell me more
than they'll tell you.

1087
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:54,010
And I can find out
what they really have.

1088
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:55,428
And what happens
if they're from Little Rock?

1089
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:56,596
They ain't.

1090
01:06:56,763 --> 01:06:59,349
One day our daddy beat Stack real bad.

1091
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,227
So we get in our minds
that we need to run away.

1092
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:05,021
See, me, I wanna go
to the next plantation over.

1093
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:08,274
But Stack, he figure
we get to Mound Bayou.

1094
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:10,777
Small town. Right here in Mississippi.

1095
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:12,695
Founded by free slaves.

1096
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:15,406
And everything is Black-owned.

1097
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:16,950
That sound like a crock.

1098
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,368
Yeah, well, I seen it.

1099
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,411
Why y'all ain't stay?

1100
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:22,872
That mayor knew who our daddy was.

1101
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,874
Knew he was a evil man.

1102
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,334
Figured it was no way

1103
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:28,628
that he ain't passed
that evil down to us.

1104
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,130
<i>Let me go get this money for us.</i>

1105
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:32,757
I know y'all need it.

1106
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,259
And what's that supposed to mean?

1107
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:35,969
See, your daddy a preacher.

1108
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:38,179
You can go and do that.

1109
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:40,974
You like makin' music?
Make church music.

1110
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,267
You wan' leave...

1111
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,686
go on down Mound Bayou.

1112
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:46,938
Live with the proper Black folks.

1113
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,358
Leave all this here improper shit to us.

1114
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:53,736
Irish beer? Italian wine?

1115
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:55,863
You rob both sides.

1116
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:57,115
Let 'em blame each other

1117
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:58,283
while you and Smoke come down here

1118
01:07:58,449 --> 01:07:59,576
and set up shop.

1119
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,286
You gon' need every dime you can get

1120
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:02,620
when they put two and two together.

1121
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:03,830
But they won't.

1122
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:04,998
They might.

1123
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:06,708
Well, I ain't goin' to Mound Bayou.

1124
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:10,378
My daddy a reverend,
but I'm y'all cousin, too.

1125
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:12,964
And a lot more people know
the Smokestack Twins

1126
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:14,340
than they know my daddy.

1127
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:15,508
Yeah?

1128
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:18,386
Well, you better enjoy
the rest of the night,

1129
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:20,138
'cause this your last juke.

1130
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:23,057
You ain't in no position

1131
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:24,434
to tell me how to live my life.

1132
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:25,602
Let me go talk to them...

1133
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,854
and see about puttin'
something real on the till.

1134
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:29,397
Come on.

1135
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:41,451
Come tomorrow,

1136
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:43,369
I find out about
you playin' in one of these...

1137
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,747
boy, I'll kill you myself.

1138
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,248
Look, I'm leaving that plantation

1139
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:48,583
just like y'all did.

1140
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,960
And if that's a problem for you...

1141
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:52,712
kill me now.

1142
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,012
What's the matter?

1143
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:03,640
I'm a soldier, boy.

1144
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:06,601

I just come to see
if y'all was good people.

1166
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,222
Aw, darlin', that's so sweet of you.

1167
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,933
- So sweet.
- We most surely are.

1168
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,518
And y'all got money to spend?

1169
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:15,980
Oh, yeah. Plenty money. You wanna see?

1170
01:11:16,147 --> 01:11:17,356
Yeah, I wanna see.

1171
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:23,488
What type of money is this?

1172
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:25,782
The solid gold kind, darlin'.

1173
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:27,825
Yeah.

1174
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:29,702
Where's this from?

1175
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:32,663
It's from a different place
and a different time.

1176
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:34,165
But it spends just the same.

1177
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:36,542
You can have it.

1178
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,420
But it's no good to you.

1179
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:41,380
- It's no good to her.
- Mm-mm.

1180
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:43,800
Well, what makes you say that?

1181
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:46,511
'Cause you in some deep, deep pain

1182
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:48,012
that money can't fix.

1183
01:11:49,514 --> 01:11:50,723
Am I right?

1184
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:53,976
You came over here
for fellowship and love.

1185
01:11:54,393 --> 01:11:56,020
Fellowship and love.

1186
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:02,693
My mother...

1187
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:06,989
she just passed.

1188
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,366
Oh, that's awful.

1189
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,327
- Oh.
- Just awful.

1190
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:12,745
Just awful.

1191
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:14,872
Losing a mother's a hurtin' feeling.

1192
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,040
Mm-hm.

1193
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:20,962
And I wish in my heart
that we'd have met sooner.

1194
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:23,631
I would've liked to have saved
your mother from her fate.

1195
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:28,511
I can still save you from yours.

1196
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:31,222
No, you must have me confused.

1197
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:34,976
I'm sad is all,
but I don't need no savin'.

1198
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:37,854
Yes. Yes, you do.

1199
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,190
You all do.

1200
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:48,573

Okay. Well, then, shit.

Hm.

1237

this pussy for a night?

Can't do that, Twin.

1250
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,054
Told him not to put his hands on me.

1251
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,764
So you gonna cut me, too?

1252

1253
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:02,141

Yeah, yeah, Sam be out directly.

1349

01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:17,581
No.

1351
01:21:17,748 --> 01:21:18,999
- Yeah, y'all got to go.
- Bullshit.

1352
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:20,167
All right, all right, you heard the man.

1353
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:22,336

1359
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:37,267
We got us a problem, y'all.

1360
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:43,440
I could have stopped it.

1361
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:45,317
Don't do that.

1362
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:46,902
I thought they was makin' love.

1363
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:48,070
I thought...

1364
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:49,238
Sammie, this is not your fault.

1365
01:21:51,782 --> 01:21:53,242
Is Stack really dead?

1366
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:57,871
Did she say anything?

1367
01:21:58,664 --> 01:22:01,083
She said, "We gonna kill all of you."

1368
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,251
"We"?

1369
01:22:04,211 --> 01:22:05,212
She said, "We"?

1370
01:22:10,217 --> 01:22:11,218
Smoke...

1371
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:17,182
We gotta move his body.

1372
01:22:17,349 --> 01:22:18,934
Outside. Just for now...

1373
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:21,937
Don't... touch him.

1374
01:22:23,814 --> 01:22:25,482
Nobody move him.

1375
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:27,317
You shot her.

1376
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:30,195
And she kept runnin'
like nothin' happened.

1377
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:33,991
This a haint we're dealin'
with, Smoke. Or worse.

1378
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:37,202
We gotta keep everybody inside
and the dead body out.

1379
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,454
This ain't no dead body.

1380
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:40,831
It's Stack.

1381
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:43,333
He's eta yin' in here with me.

1382
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:48,297
You got any magic
to bring my brother back?

1383
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:51,675
Got a mojo bag for him?

1384
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,511
- I can't.
- Please.

1385
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:58,182
I can't. I'm sorry.

1386
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:02,644
Damn.

1387
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:04,480
He gone.

1388
01:23:05,898 --> 01:23:06,899
He gone.

1389
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,249
Best thing about me was him.

1390
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:26,376
- We gotta go.
- What?

1391
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:27,711
We gotta get out of here.

1392
01:23:27,878 --> 01:23:29,129

1393
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:31,673
Look, we came here to help
them with the party, not this.

1394
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,467

1395
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,427
- Okay.

01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:36,595
Yeah.

1397
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:38,263
- Okay? Let's go home.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1398
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:40,390
- Go get the car.
- All right, I'll get the car.

1399
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:42,267
- Okay. Okay.

1400
01:23:58,450 --> 01:23:59,493

1401
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:07,334
What happened?

1402
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:08,794

01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:01,305
You big and strong enough
to push past us.

1418
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:03,223
Well, that wouldn't be too polite,

1419
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:04,433
now, would it, Miss Annie?

1420
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,103
I don't know why
I'm talking to you anyway.

1421
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:09,730
Probably your fish sandwich

1422
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:11,273
messed up my guts in the first place.

1423
01:25:11,565 --> 01:25:12,608
Usin' old, stale grease.

1424
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:14,651
I ain't never used stale grease,
and you know it.

1425
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:16,945
- Shut up, Annie. Smoke...
- Don't talk to him.

1426
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:18,113
You talkin' to me right now.

1427
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,865
Why you can't just walk your big ass

1428
01:25:20,032 --> 01:25:21,325
up in here without an invite, huh?

1429
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:25,704
Go 'head. Admit to it.

1430
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:27,414
Admit to what?

1431
01:25:28,415 --> 01:25:29,583
That you dead.

1432
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,210
That one of them white folks
out there kill you,

1433
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:33,587
and you a haint now.

1434
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:41,553
Smoke, you listenin' to this?

1435
01:25:43,347 --> 01:25:45,557
Woman, this man showed me kindness.

1436
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:48,727
Employed me. Grabbed me out the field.

1437
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:50,354
Now, he say his brother been killed.

1438
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,521
The man needs comfort,

1439
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:53,523
not you fillin' up his mind

1440
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:56,276
with that old Lousiana bayou
bullshit you on.

1441
01:25:56,443 --> 01:25:59,112
Now, we out here playing games,

1442
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:00,614
telling ghost stories

1443
01:26:00,781 --> 01:26:02,949
in place of doin' what we ought to do.

1444
01:26:05,452 --> 01:26:07,120
And what is it we s'pose to be doin'?

1445
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,999
Bein' kind to one another!

1446
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:14,878
And bein' polite.
Now, we is one peoples.

1447
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:17,381
And we shouldn't go in,

1448
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:19,299
bargin' into other folks'
places uninvited.

1449
01:26:19,466 --> 01:26:20,467
So...

1450
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:24,846
You been in and outta here all day.

1451
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:27,057
Ain't never need an invite then.

1452
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:30,894
Yeah, somethin' ain't addin' up.

1453
01:26:31,603 --> 01:26:33,647
Shit, Stack was my ride up here.

1454
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:35,107
I 'posed to walk back?

1455
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:36,483
That ain't my problem.

1456
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:40,278
Well, it be, your own peoples.

1457
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:42,656
And I thought you was better than this,

1458
01:26:42,823 --> 01:26:44,074
but you just like the white man.

1459
01:26:48,245 --> 01:26:49,663
Can I at least get my money?

1460
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:51,331
You did such a bang-up job...

1461
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:52,958
now you wanna get paid
for what you ain't did?

1462
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:54,167
Ain't nobody talkin' to you,
you old drunk.

1463
01:26:54,334 --> 01:26:56,253
- Shut your mouth.
- No, you shut the fuck up.

1464
01:26:56,837 --> 01:26:58,338
Don't give him shit, Smoke.
Don't give him nothin'.

1465
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,051
Careful.

1466
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:20,068
Smoke! Smoke!

1467
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:22,446
- Oh, no!
- Smoke!

1468
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:43,008
Close it! Close the door!

1469
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:44,760
Close the door!
What the fuck? What the fuck?

1470
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:46,887
He got you? Did he get you?

1471
01:27:47,053 --> 01:27:48,221
I'm all right,
I'm all right, I'm all right.

1472
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:49,931
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

1473
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,308
Hey. Hey.

1474
01:27:53,685 --> 01:27:55,228
Y'all smell anything?

1475
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:56,688
No.

1476
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,274
I think I shat myself.

1477
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:04,696
How the hell he get up, huh?

1478
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:05,864
I don't know. I don't know.

1479
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:07,032
I shot the nigga in his head.

1480
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:08,700
Cornbread pulled me
out the goddamn door.

1481
01:28:10,744 --> 01:28:12,078
Is someone in there?

1482
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:21,797
Smoke.

1483
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:22,923
Smoke!

1484
01:28:23,673 --> 01:28:24,674
Smoke?

1485
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:27,052
Go on ahead.

1486
01:28:27,219 --> 01:28:28,595
Open up this door,
let me on out of here.

1487
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:38,271
Stack...

1488
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:40,565
Nigga, that's you?

1489
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:42,150
Nah, fool, it's Jim Crow.

1490
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:43,819
Nigga, of course it's me. Open the door.

1491
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:45,737
Stack...

1492
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:51,910
How you feelin'?

1493
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:54,621
Boy, you lost a lot of blood.

1494
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:58,583
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1495
01:29:03,213 --> 01:29:05,674
It was scary,
and I'm doing much better now.

1496
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:07,884
I swear. On Mama grave.

1497
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:09,970
I thought you said he was dead.

1498
01:29:10,136 --> 01:29:13,098
He was. I checked his pulse.

1499
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,433
Then what the fuck
is he doin' talkin' to us?

1500
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,645
But this is good, right?
Means he's okay.

1501
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:20,689
Smoke...

1502
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:23,650
that ain't your brother.

1503
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:25,360
Smoke, what that witch
out there talkin' 'bout?

1504
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:27,445
You gonna let her
get in between us again?

1505
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:28,613
What we been through...

1506
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:30,240
German trenches, nigga.

1507
01:29:30,407 --> 01:29:31,825
Chicago gangways.

1508
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:34,536
Come on, man.

1509
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:36,496
Y'all niggas gonna pay for this shit.

1510
01:29:36,663 --> 01:29:38,915
Lockin' this pimp in the closet, huh?

1511
01:29:39,082 --> 01:29:40,208
Huh? Open the door, Smoke!

1512
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:41,835
Let me the fuck out
or I swear before God,

1513
01:29:42,002 --> 01:29:44,045
I'm Ia yin' all you sons of bitches down.

1514
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:45,755
One by one!

1515
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:53,013
Smoke. Come on, man.
Open the door, it's me.

1516
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,348
You know I don't like this shit, man.

1517
01:29:55,515 --> 01:29:57,100
Please, Smoke, let me out of this room.

1518
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:58,393
Smoke, please.

1519
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:02,522
Annie, give me the key.

1520
01:30:03,773 --> 01:30:04,900
Stack?

1521
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:17,370
Stop!

1522
01:30:19,956 --> 01:30:20,957
Hey!

1523
01:30:22,208 --> 01:30:23,209
Sammie!

1524
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:27,380
Come on, get up.

1525
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:32,469
What was in the jar?

1526
01:30:32,636 --> 01:30:33,929
Pickled garlic.

1527
01:30:35,055 --> 01:30:36,264
These ain't haints.

1528
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:38,516
They're vampires.

1529
01:30:43,063 --> 01:30:45,690
Bo's out there.
We gotta go get him.

1530
01:30:45,857 --> 01:30:47,025
I'm the one who sent him out there.

1531
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:49,110
- Can't let you do that.
- He needs my help.

1532
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:50,946
Bo know how to handle himself.

1533
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:52,989
Probably got in that car
and got someplace safe.

1534
01:30:53,156 --> 01:30:54,491
Y'all ain't gonna keep me
from my husband.

1535
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:56,826
Grace, we tr yin' to keep you
alive right now.

1536
01:30:56,993 --> 01:30:59,079
We just gotta hole up till sunrise.

1537
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:00,288
Okay?

1538
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:04,668
Now, we need...

1539
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:06,252
garlic...

1540
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:09,714
wood...

1541
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:13,885
...silver, and holy water.

1542
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:16,846
Shit might not kill 'em,
but it'll slow 'em down.

1543
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:21,017
How could it move
and sound like Stack...

1544
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:22,894
if it ain't Stack?

1545
01:31:23,269 --> 01:31:24,854
I only ever heard stories.

1546
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:26,481
I ain't never come across them myself.

1547
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:28,108
What stories you heard?

1548
01:31:28,274 --> 01:31:31,486
How haints work. They switch
places with the soul of a man.

1549
01:31:33,113 --> 01:31:34,531
But vampires is different.

1550
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:37,450
<i>Maybe the worst kind.</i>

1551
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:40,286
The soul gets stuck in the body.

1552
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:42,539
Can't rejoin the ancestors.

1553
01:31:42,706 --> 01:31:45,041
Cursed to live here with all this hate.

1554
01:31:47,669 --> 01:31:49,796
Can't even feel the warmth of a sunrise.

1555
01:31:51,798 --> 01:31:54,384
Okay then. Can we bring him back?

1556
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:56,511
If I killed the ones
that made him this way...

1557
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:57,804
<i>Smoke...</i>

1558
01:31:57,971 --> 01:32:00,348
<i>They have a connection,
but they live on...</i>

1559
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:02,892
even if the one
that made them is killed.

1560
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:04,602
The best thing we can do for him

1561
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:06,271
is free his spirit from this curse.

1562
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:08,523
They gotta be killed, one by one.

1563
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:10,108
And how the hell do we do that?

1564
01:32:11,317 --> 01:32:12,527
Sunlight.

1565
01:32:13,278 --> 01:32:15,071
A wooden stake to the heart.

1566
01:32:17,073 --> 01:32:18,700
The hell, Annie?

1567
01:32:19,034 --> 01:32:21,369
I kept that boy safe all these years.

1568
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:24,330
<i>All over this world.</i>

1569
01:32:24,497 --> 01:32:25,498
Why tonight?

1570
01:32:26,916 --> 01:32:27,917
It's 'cause of me.

1571
01:32:28,710 --> 01:32:29,961
My daddy told me.

1572
01:32:30,754 --> 01:32:32,881
He said the Devil was comin'
on account of my music.

1573
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:35,592
I had a gal once, vampire.

1574
01:32:35,759 --> 01:32:37,218
She was light skinneded, too.

1575
01:32:37,719 --> 01:32:39,471
That gal bit me everywhere but my neck.

1576
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:43,183
Sammie...

1577
01:32:44,517 --> 01:32:45,977
you don't worry about a thing, hear?

1578
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:48,730
Devil done came for me plenty of times.

1579
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:50,690
If he come knockin' tonight...

1580
01:32:52,692 --> 01:32:55,403
he gonna have to go through
his old friend Delta Slim

1581
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:56,780
before he get to you.

1582
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:58,615
That go for everybody in here.

1583
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:05,330
If I get bit by one of them...

1584
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:07,499
promise me, right now...

1585
01:33:07,665 --> 01:33:09,751
that you'll free me 'fore I turn.

1586
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:11,544
What you mean, "free you"?

1587
01:33:14,631 --> 01:33:15,882
I got somebody on the other side

1588
01:33:16,049 --> 01:33:17,300
waitin' for me.

1589
01:33:18,551 --> 01:33:20,095
They waitin' on you, too.

1590
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:31,147
You understand?

1591
01:33:31,314 --> 01:33:32,774

Sammie! Smoke!

1595
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:41,407
Well, who did this?
Was it Stack or Mary?

1596
01:33:41,574 --> 01:33:44,285
Nah. They ran straight out.
You saw them.

1597
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:46,037
Well, who bit him, then?

1598
01:33:46,412 --> 01:33:47,789
We gotta get him out before he wakes up.

Eat, or I'll shoot.

1651
01:36:55,768 --> 01:36:57,562
Put the gun down, Smoke.
She ain't no damn vampire.

1652
01:36:57,729 --> 01:36:59,022
How the hell you know that?

1653
01:36:59,188 --> 01:37:00,648
Just eat the damn garlic, girl.

1654
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:02,859
Smoke!

1655
01:37:03,026 --> 01:37:04,152
I'm trying to keep you alive, boy.

1656
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:05,320
You ain't to question me.

1657
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:07,196
You a evil man.

1658
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:10,199
No wonder the Devil come for us.

1659
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:38,686
- Mm-mm.
- Hey, Slim.

1660
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:39,854
What's goin' on, man?

1661
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,524
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

1662
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:45,318
Slim?

1663
01:37:50,156 --> 01:37:51,866
What's goin' on, Slim?

1664
01:37:53,993 --> 01:37:55,578
I drank too much.

1665
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:58,664
That goddamn beer
from Chicago.

1666
01:37:58,831 --> 01:38:01,000
My nerves all fucked up, Smoke.

1667
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,008
I'm fine.

1668
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:12,095
See?

1669
01:38:12,261 --> 01:38:13,888
You sure that was blood?

1670
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:38,246
Hey. Hey, Smoke, let me in, man.

1671
01:38:40,623 --> 01:38:42,625
Huh. Lookit here.

1672
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:44,043
Smoke, Smoke, let me in!

1673
01:38:44,919 --> 01:38:46,337
Smoke, I swear I paid my tab, man.

1674
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:47,630
That's what this about?

1675
01:38:47,839 --> 01:38:49,757
Smoke! Hey, Smoke!

1676
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:51,342
Whatever you need, man!

1677
01:38:51,509 --> 01:38:54,095
Smoke! Some weird shit
going on out here, Smoke!

1678
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:55,805
I know you hear me, Smoke!

1679
01:38:55,972 --> 01:38:57,974
Smoke, let me in! Smoke, let me in!

1680
01:39:00,143 --> 01:39:01,352
Whoa, what the... Oh, shit.

1681
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:03,604
Get off me!

1682
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:06,607
- Close the door. Come on.
- Wait!

1683
01:39:07,316 --> 01:39:08,609
- Get off of me!
- Bo.

1684
01:39:08,985 --> 01:39:10,611
- Get your ass off of me!
- Hey, baby.

1685
01:39:10,987 --> 01:39:11,988
Come on outside, I got the car started.

1686
01:39:12,155 --> 01:39:13,156
Let's go.

1687
01:39:16,701 --> 01:39:17,910
What is it, Grace?

1688
01:39:19,454 --> 01:39:20,621
He's killing him.

1689
01:39:21,664 --> 01:39:22,874
Oh, you talking about that?

1690
01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:24,876
Oh, don't worry about Cornbread.

1691
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:28,004
He's just a little hungry,
that's all. Let's go.

1692
01:39:28,754 --> 01:39:30,339
Come on.

1693
01:39:34,093 --> 01:39:36,304
Come on and go.
I got the car all warmed up.

1694
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:42,852
Or...

1695
01:39:45,271 --> 01:39:47,815
You let me back in there.

1696
01:39:49,192 --> 01:39:52,653
And I'll come in,
and we can grab our things...

1697
01:39:53,613 --> 01:39:54,906
and head home?

1698
01:39:55,490 --> 01:39:56,491
Don't listen to him.

1699
01:39:56,657 --> 01:39:58,493
Grace, we're gonna find a way
out of this, I promise.

1700
01:39:58,659 --> 01:40:00,786
I am your way out.

1701
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:05,082
This world already
left you for dead.

1702
01:40:06,501 --> 01:40:09,712
Won't let you build.
Won't let you fellowship.

1703
01:40:10,213 --> 01:40:13,132
We will do just that. Together.

1704
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,093
Forever.

1705
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:17,887
It's better this way, baby.

1706
01:40:19,138 --> 01:40:22,183
So why don't you go ahead, invite us in.

1707
01:40:22,642 --> 01:40:24,227
You should
listen to him, Grace.

1708
01:40:24,393 --> 01:40:26,354
Or listen to me.

1709
01:40:26,521 --> 01:40:28,606
'Cause I know everything he knows now.

1710
01:40:29,232 --> 01:40:31,526
And I want you to let us in there.

1711
01:40:32,693 --> 01:40:34,111
Or we gon' go to the grocery store.

1712
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:36,113
We gon' pay little Lisa a visit.

1713
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:37,281
No, no,

1714
01:40:37,448 --> 01:40:39,033
- don't you fucking dare!
- No, no, no.

1715
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,284
- No!
- Oh, yeah, Grace.

1716
01:40:40,451 --> 01:40:42,328
I know everything now.

1717
01:40:57,843 --> 01:40:59,178
This can't be real.

1718
01:41:00,513 --> 01:41:03,224
You the Devil. Ain't you?

1719
01:41:03,683 --> 01:41:04,725
Sammie!

1720
01:41:06,602 --> 01:41:08,396
You the one I came for.

1721
01:41:09,021 --> 01:41:10,064
<i>I sensed you.</i>

1722
01:41:10,231 --> 01:41:13,234
<i>I wanna see my people again.
I'm trapped here.</i>

1723
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:15,403
<i>But your gifts can bring 'em to me.</i>

1724
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,282
Y'all give him to me now.
Just give me little Sammie...

1725
01:41:19,448 --> 01:41:20,533
we'll let y'all live.

1726
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,204
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, easy. Easy.

1727
01:41:25,371 --> 01:41:27,957
I'm gon' tell you somethin',
you goddamn peckerwood.

1728
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:30,376
You can't have him.

1729
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:34,672
He belongs to us. He belongs with us.

1730
01:41:35,423 --> 01:41:37,258
And I ain't gonna let that happen.

1731
01:41:37,466 --> 01:41:38,801
You can't save him, Smoke,

1732
01:41:38,968 --> 01:41:40,386
no more than you could
save your brother.

1733
01:41:47,184 --> 01:41:49,103
You ain't safe here.

1734
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:51,897
No matter how many guns,
or how much money...

1735
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:54,191
They gon' take it from you
when they want.

1736
01:41:54,817 --> 01:41:56,277
You built somethin' here tonight,

1737
01:41:56,444 --> 01:41:57,695
and it was beautiful.

1738
01:41:57,862 --> 01:42:00,489
But it was built on a lie.

1739
01:42:01,824 --> 01:42:06,621
Hogwood, well, he's the Grand
Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan.

1740
01:42:06,787 --> 01:42:08,623
That's his motherfuckin' nephew.

1741
01:42:09,874 --> 01:42:12,084
And they was always gon' kill you.

1742
01:42:12,251 --> 01:42:14,211
<i>I just happened to show up
at the right place</i>

1743
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:15,713
<i>at the right time.</i>

1744
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:17,298
He tellin' the truth, Smoke.

1745
01:42:18,382 --> 01:42:20,384
I can see his memories.

1746
01:42:20,551 --> 01:42:22,595
Smoke, that ain't your brother.

1747
01:42:22,762 --> 01:42:25,389
This wasn't no juke joint. No club.

1748
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:28,851
This here's a slaughterhouse.

1749
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:30,645
It's a goddamn killing floor.

1750
01:42:30,811 --> 01:42:32,438
But what Uncle Hogwood don't know

1751
01:42:32,605 --> 01:42:35,149
is we're gonna start
ourselves a new clan,

1752
01:42:35,316 --> 01:42:36,567
based on love.

1753
01:42:37,902 --> 01:42:38,903
Now that we got numbers,

1754
01:42:39,070 --> 01:42:40,237
we'll probably go to that old bigot

1755
01:42:40,404 --> 01:42:42,323
and rectify him, too.

1756
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:43,783
Why can't y'all just go?

1757
01:42:43,949 --> 01:42:46,202
'Cause we're not leavin' without y'all.

1758
01:42:47,328 --> 01:42:49,747
We're family. Ain't that right?

1759
01:42:49,914 --> 01:42:54,377
I know it sound crazy,
but after we kill y'all...

1760
01:42:54,543 --> 01:42:56,962

1761
01:42:57,129 --> 01:42:58,255
Mm.

1762
01:43:01,342 --> 01:43:02,343
Oh.

1763
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:04,261
Hey there.

1764
01:43:08,683 --> 01:43:10,142
- Come on.
- Welcome.

1765
01:43:13,479 --> 01:43:16,315
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.

1766
01:43:16,482 --> 01:43:17,733
Hey, let me tell you somethin'.

1767
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:19,777
Let me tell you
goddamn somethin', nigga.

1768
01:43:20,361 --> 01:43:21,445
The Stack I know

1769
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:24,031
ain't fellow shipping
with no goddamn devil.

1770
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:26,033
Fuck you, nigger. It is me.

1771
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:27,743
Elias Moore.

1772
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:29,745
And I'm talkin' to my big
brother right now, Slim...

1773
01:43:29,912 --> 01:43:31,831
so I'mma kindly ask you
to shut the fuck up.

1774
01:43:34,917 --> 01:43:36,293
We was never gonna be free.

1775
01:43:36,794 --> 01:43:38,003
We've been running around everywhere

1776
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:39,296
looking for freedom.

1777
01:43:40,005 --> 01:43:42,925
You know damn well
you was never gonna find it.

1778
01:43:43,718 --> 01:43:44,969
Until this.

1779
01:43:45,553 --> 01:43:48,139
This is the way.

1780
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:50,224
Together.

1781
01:43:50,391 --> 01:43:51,809
Forever.

1782
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,480
And I ain't doing this shit without ya.

1783
01:43:57,481 --> 01:43:59,191
There is no me without you.

1784
01:44:01,444 --> 01:44:02,903
What's it gon' be?

1785
01:44:05,239 --> 01:44:07,158
- No. No, no, no.
- Hey.

1786
01:44:07,324 --> 01:44:08,576
We're closin' the door.

1787
01:44:08,951 --> 01:44:10,494
- No. No.
- No, man.

1788
01:44:15,541 --> 01:44:17,001
No vision.

1789
01:44:24,842 --> 01:44:26,844
He said he was gonna
take our daughter.

1790
01:44:27,011 --> 01:44:28,012
You can't believe him.

1791
01:44:28,179 --> 01:44:29,430
He was just trying
to get you to let him in.

1792
01:44:29,597 --> 01:44:30,931
He ain't threatened your children!

1793
01:44:31,098 --> 01:44:32,391
We just gotta stay through the night.

1794
01:44:33,476 --> 01:44:35,936
And what? Let him kill my family?

1795
01:44:36,562 --> 01:44:37,688
Kill the whole town?

1796
01:44:38,147 --> 01:44:40,024
Turn everybody to monsters?

1797
01:44:40,775 --> 01:44:43,027
That white devil spoke Chinese.

1798
01:44:43,194 --> 01:44:45,029
He got in Bo's mind.

1799
01:44:46,489 --> 01:44:48,115
We gotta stop 'em, Smoke.

1800
01:44:49,033 --> 01:44:50,701
We gotta get 'em before they get away.

1801
01:44:50,868 --> 01:44:53,704
Grace, just slow down.
Give me a second to think.

1802
01:44:53,871 --> 01:44:56,248
What? Ain't you a soldier?

1803
01:44:58,375 --> 01:44:59,251
Yeah?

1804
01:45:03,714 --> 01:45:06,175
Didn't you just shoot two men
for touching your truck?

1805
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:08,803
They killed your brother.

1806
01:45:09,637 --> 01:45:11,222
Made Stack one of 'em.

1807
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:12,807
And my Bo.

1808
01:45:13,432 --> 01:45:15,851
Said they was gon' kill Lisa.

1809
01:45:16,018 --> 01:45:18,813
If now ain't go time,
then I don't know what is.

1810
01:45:20,606 --> 01:45:21,607
We supposed to wait the night

1811
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:23,651
while they take more of our loved ones?

1812
01:45:23,818 --> 01:45:24,902
Make 'em demons?

1813
01:45:25,194 --> 01:45:26,403
They don't look like
they leavin', Grace.

1814
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:28,531
Oh, shut your drunk ass up, Slim!

1815
01:45:28,697 --> 01:45:30,741
I ain't drunk right now.

1816
01:45:30,908 --> 01:45:32,785
You need to watch your mouth, woman.

1817

What you doin'?

1818
01:45:35,454 --> 01:45:36,789

Keep running. Right to the sunrise.

1903

1907
01:51:11,832 --> 01:51:13,792

1908
01:51:14,251 --> 01:51:15,586
Our Father...

1909
01:51:16,295 --> 01:51:18,088
which art in Heaven...

1910
01:51:18,672 --> 01:51:20,465

<i>On Earth, as it is in heaven.</i>

1914
01:51:30,559 --> 01:51:32,060
Give us this day our daily bread...

1915
01:51:32,144 --> 01:51:33,353
Our daily bread...

1916
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,106
and forgive us our trespasses...

1917
01:51:36,273 --> 01:51:39,484
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1918
01:51:40,569 --> 01:51:43,197
<i>And lead us not into temptation...</i>

1919
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:45,574
<i>but deliver us from evil.</i>

1920
01:51:47,075 --> 01:51:48,160
Amen.

1921
01:51:49,119 --> 01:51:50,787
Long ago...

1922
01:51:50,954 --> 01:51:52,831
the men who stole my father's land

1923
01:51:52,915 --> 01:51:54,750
forced these words upon us.

1924
01:51:54,917 --> 01:51:56,835
I hated those men,

1925
01:51:56,919 --> 01:51:58,795
but the words still bring me comfort.

1926
01:52:06,303 --> 01:52:07,804
Hey! Hey. Stay your ass down.

1927
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:10,474
I'm bored of you, man.

1928
01:52:11,141 --> 01:52:12,226
Mother...

1929
01:52:12,517 --> 01:52:15,520
Those men lied
to themselves and lied to us.

1930
01:52:18,482 --> 01:52:21,568
They told stories of a God
above and a Devil below.

1931
01:52:21,985 --> 01:52:26,240
And lies of a dominion of man
over beast and Earth.

1932
01:52:50,138 --> 01:52:51,932
Sorry I couldn't keep you safe.

1933
01:52:52,557 --> 01:52:55,560
Don't be sorry. You always did.

1934
01:52:56,853 --> 01:52:59,606
We are earth and beast and god.

1935
01:52:59,773 --> 01:53:01,608
We are woman and man.

1936
01:53:01,775 --> 01:53:04,736
We are connected, you and I...

1937
01:53:05,988 --> 01:53:07,823
to everything.

1938
01:53:22,504 --> 01:53:23,922
Shit!

1939
01:53:24,298 --> 01:53:25,632
No.

1940
01:53:36,101 --> 01:53:39,354
You will taste the sweet pain of death.

1941
01:53:39,688 --> 01:53:44,735
We will make beautiful music together.

1942
01:53:59,583 --> 01:54:01,501
- He get you? Did he get you?
- No!

1943
01:54:09,426 --> 01:54:10,677
I'm here. I'm here.

1944
01:54:19,019 --> 01:54:20,103
- The sun!
- The sun!

1945
01:55:26,962 --> 01:55:27,963
Want help?

1946
01:55:38,890 --> 01:55:39,891
Go home.

1947
01:55:41,726 --> 01:55:43,186
And bury that fuckin' guitar.

1948
01:55:51,069 --> 01:55:52,070
I can't.

1949
01:55:53,989 --> 01:55:55,407
It's Charley Patton's.

1950
01:55:56,867 --> 01:55:57,868
What?

1951
01:55:59,286 --> 01:56:00,620
Boy, who told you that?

1952
01:56:04,791 --> 01:56:05,792
Stack.

1953
01:56:08,044 --> 01:56:09,588
Said y'all won it off him.

1954
01:56:12,883 --> 01:56:14,593
Lyin' son of a bitch.

1955
01:56:17,304 --> 01:56:18,889
That's our daddy guitar.

1956
01:56:21,099 --> 01:56:22,350
Hey. Come here.

1957
01:56:23,977 --> 01:56:25,270

1958
01:56:26,980 --> 01:56:27,981
Hear me?

1959
01:56:30,609 --> 01:56:32,152
I got some business to handle.

1960
01:56:33,987 --> 01:56:36,448

1968
01:58:49,664 --> 01:58:51,333
Klan don't exist no more.

1969
01:58:51,875 --> 01:58:53,543
Little coon huntin'

1970
01:58:53,710 --> 01:58:55,462
Love skinnin' me a nigger

1971
01:58:55,545 --> 01:58:56,630
first thing of the day.

1972
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:58,882
Gettin' a little
too uppity around here.

1973
01:58:59,049 --> 01:59:00,675
Time to teach these boys a lesson.

1974
01:59:01,301 --> 01:59:02,552
Club Juke, huh?

1975
01:59:03,470 --> 01:59:05,263
Grand openin' and grand closin'.

1976
01:59:06,222 --> 01:59:08,266
- Let's do it. Open it up.
- Yeah.

1977
01:59:13,396 --> 01:59:14,397
Sammie!

1978
01:59:19,027 --> 01:59:20,028
Come, son.

1979
01:59:25,784 --> 01:59:26,826
Door's locked.

1980
01:59:27,410 --> 01:59:28,411
Try the front.

1981
01:59:28,953 --> 01:59:30,789
Drop the guitar, Samuel.

1982
01:59:33,249 --> 01:59:35,585
This one is, too.

1983
01:59:36,211 --> 01:59:37,796
Where the hell
is it comin' from?

1984
01:59:37,879 --> 01:59:38,963
Niggers is shootin' at us!

1985
01:59:48,264 --> 01:59:49,474
Kill his Black ass!

1986
02:00:08,702 --> 02:00:10,829
Drive!
Drive, damn it, drive!

1987
02:00:53,788 --> 02:00:55,582
Drop the guitar, Samuel.

1988
02:00:55,749 --> 02:00:58,168
Put it down. In the name of God.

1989
02:00:59,836 --> 02:01:01,045
You tell them...

1990
02:01:02,255 --> 02:01:03,423
<i>"my heart...</i>

1991
02:01:04,799 --> 02:01:06,176
my voice...

1992
02:01:07,135 --> 02:01:08,428
my soul...

1993
02:01:09,387 --> 02:01:11,347
belongeth to the Lord."

1994
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:14,601
You got a cigarette?

1995
02:01:15,143 --> 02:01:16,561
You go to hell, nigger.

1996
02:02:10,657 --> 02:02:12,242
Hmm.

1997
02:02:14,410 --> 02:02:15,578
Elijah.

1998
02:02:16,663 --> 02:02:18,957
You put that cig out, you can hold her.

1999
02:02:26,339 --> 02:02:28,758
I don't want any of that smoke
to get on her.

2000
02:02:39,853 --> 02:02:41,896
Hey. Listen...

2001
02:02:44,065 --> 02:02:46,025
I got money. Huh?

2002
02:03:33,740 --> 02:03:34,991
Papa's here.

2003
02:05:42,618 --> 02:05:43,703
Hey, boss...

2004
02:05:43,953 --> 02:05:44,954
we got two out there.

2005
02:05:45,121 --> 02:05:46,122
I told 'em we closed,

2006
02:05:46,289 --> 02:05:47,123
but they offered a couple hundred bucks.

2007
02:05:47,290 --> 02:05:49,333
- That okay with you?
- That don't bother me none.

2008
02:05:52,879 --> 02:05:53,880
Come on in.

2009
02:06:13,149 --> 02:06:14,817
Vampires is different.

2010
02:06:14,984 --> 02:06:16,778
<i>Maybe the worst kind.</i>

2011
02:06:17,403 --> 02:06:18,738
<i>But they live on,</i>

2012
02:06:18,905 --> 02:06:21,157
<i>even if the one
that made them is killed.</i>

2013
02:06:21,866 --> 02:06:24,160
<i>They gotta be killed, one by one.</i>

2014
02:06:28,915 --> 02:06:30,750
I'll have whatever the old man havin'.

2015
02:06:49,143 --> 02:06:50,186
Hm.

2016
02:06:54,273 --> 02:06:55,274
How?

2017
02:06:55,942 --> 02:06:58,402
I guess I was the one person
he just couldn't kill.

2018
02:06:58,569 --> 02:07:00,988
<i>He made me promise
to stay away from you.</i>

2019
02:07:01,197 --> 02:07:03,116
Let you live out your life.

2020
02:07:13,793 --> 02:07:15,586
It won't be long for you, huh?

2021
02:07:18,089 --> 02:07:20,091
I could make it
so that you could stick around.

2022
02:07:20,758 --> 02:07:22,093
Keep tourin'.

2023
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:23,761
Keep livin'.

2024
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:25,721
No pain.

2025
02:07:28,641 --> 02:07:30,852
I think I've seen enough of this place.

2026
02:07:32,436 --> 02:07:33,688
Hm.

2027
02:07:34,772 --> 02:07:37,024
You know, we got every
single one of your records.

2028
02:07:37,567 --> 02:07:38,943
I don't like that electric shit

2029
02:07:39,110 --> 02:07:40,319
as much as the real.

2030
02:07:40,486 --> 02:07:41,737
Yeah.

2031
02:07:41,904 --> 02:07:43,364
I miss the real.

2032
02:07:44,699 --> 02:07:47,201
Recordings from back then
sound like a pile of dog shit.

2033
02:07:50,079 --> 02:07:51,372
How about it, Sammie?

2034
02:07:53,374 --> 02:07:54,917

2053
