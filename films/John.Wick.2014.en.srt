1
00:00:37,858 --> 00:00:39,710
<i>It looks like the storm has passed.</i>

2
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,796
<i>New Yorkers, a season high,
seven inches of rain last night.</i>

3
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:47,100
<i>High winds and flooding in some areas
even left some New Yorkers stranded.</i>

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,669
<i>City crews still working this morning.</i>

5
00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:51,921
<i>They're trying to restore power
to several areas in the boroughs.</i>

6
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:55,838
<i>Good news is, today should be
sunny with highs in the low 60s.</i>

7
00:00:58,728 --> 00:01:00,754
<i>Relentless weather these past few weeks.</i>

8
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:04,250
<i>So get out there, enjoy the sun,
go to the park, get outside if you can,</i>

9
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,920
<i>because it's not gonna last long.</i>

10
00:01:39,352 --> 00:01:41,285
<i>What are you doing, John?</i>

11
00:01:41,955 --> 00:01:43,721
<i>Looking at you.</i>

12
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:45,073
<i>Come here.</i>

13
00:01:51,865 --> 00:01:53,964
<i>Are you still filming?</i>

14
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,592
<i>Just an anniversary...</i>

15
00:05:01,654 --> 00:05:03,021
It's been a while.

16
00:05:04,357 --> 00:05:06,224
My condolences.

17
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:09,317
How're you holdin' up?

18
00:05:10,022 --> 00:05:12,626
I keep asking "Why her?"

19
00:05:13,033 --> 00:05:16,003
There's no rhyme or reason to this life.

20
00:05:16,603 --> 00:05:20,237
It's days like today
scattered among the rest.

21
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,742
- Are you sure?
- Don't blame yourself.

22
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:30,581
What are you really doing here, Marcus?

23
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:36,320
Just checkin' up on an old friend.

24
00:05:43,463 --> 00:05:44,462
Goodbye, John.

25
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,432
- John Wick?
- Yes.

26
00:06:19,532 --> 00:06:21,232
Sign here, please.

27
00:06:28,908 --> 00:06:30,708
And the pen.

28
00:06:31,211 --> 00:06:32,379
Sorry.

29
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,778
- Here you go. Good night.
- Thanks.

30
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:08,381
<i>"John, I'm sorry I can't
be there for you.</i>

31
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:11,952
<i>"But you still need something,
someone, to love.</i>

32
00:07:12,552 --> 00:07:17,257
<i>"So start with this.
Because the car doesn't count.</i>

33
00:07:17,657 --> 00:07:21,728
<i>"I love you, John. This illness
has loomed over us for a long time,</i>

34
00:07:21,828 --> 00:07:25,365
<i>"and now that I have found
my peace, find yours.</i>

35
00:07:25,465 --> 00:07:30,000
<i>"Until that day,
your best friend, Helen."</i>

36
00:08:06,739 --> 00:08:07,838
Hey.

37
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:12,943
Hey.

38
00:08:17,683 --> 00:08:18,951
Daisy.

39
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:22,152
Of course.

40
00:08:26,693 --> 00:08:27,992
Hey.

41
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:35,299
Come on.

42
00:08:59,926 --> 00:09:02,495
I'm up. I'm up...

43
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:05,129
I'm up. I'm up.

44
00:09:23,183 --> 00:09:24,782
Hey!

45
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:28,986
Oh. Right.

46
00:09:42,768 --> 00:09:43,567
What?

47
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,815
We'll grab you some kibble later.

48
00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:27,070
Nice ride.

49
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:32,642
Mustang. Boss 429.

50
00:11:33,588 --> 00:11:36,282
- She a '70?
- '69.

51
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:39,719
Beautiful car.

52
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:41,084
Thanks.

53
00:11:43,456 --> 00:11:45,792
- How much?
- Excuse me?

54
00:11:46,592 --> 00:11:48,158
How much for the car?

55
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:50,961
She's not for sale.

56
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,668
Oh, I love dogs.

57
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,314
You have good day, sir.

58
00:13:40,172 --> 00:13:42,005
All right, come on, then.

59
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:47,811
How you doin'?

60
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,358
You need to go?

61
00:16:48,194 --> 00:16:49,993
Yo, Aurelio!

62
00:16:51,897 --> 00:16:54,865
I want a new VIN number
and some clean papers.

63
00:16:55,735 --> 00:16:57,901
Where'd you get that car?

64
00:17:50,422 --> 00:17:51,688
Is it here?

65
00:18:02,501 --> 00:18:04,301
It was.

66
00:18:05,638 --> 00:18:08,860
- I asked you where the hell did
you get it? - Who gives a shit?

67
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:11,840
<i>Iosef Tarasov nicked it.</i>

68
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:13,944
Viggo's son.

69
00:18:16,515 --> 00:18:17,381
Yeah.

70
00:18:20,086 --> 00:18:22,021
All right, get out of here. Just get
out of my shop. Get out right now.

71
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:23,989
Did you just lose your shit, Aurelio?

72
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:26,890
Because we own you.

73
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:34,066
What did you say?
What did you say to me?

74
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,932
We own you.

75
00:18:37,136 --> 00:18:40,871
You don't own me, punk.
I work with your father, all right?

76
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:45,444
The owner of that car,
did you kill him or what?

77
00:18:45,544 --> 00:18:49,115
No. I sure as hell fucked up his dog.

78
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,717
You fucked up his dog? That's what
you did? You fucked up his dog?

79
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:55,387
- Yeah...
- That's crazy shit, man.

80
00:18:59,592 --> 00:19:02,394
Aw, look at you. That's great.

81
00:19:02,494 --> 00:19:04,964
You're gonna come into my shop
and you're gonna pull a gun on me.

82
00:19:05,064 --> 00:19:07,299
That's great, man. Come on!

83
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:12,436
Now, either you kill me right now
or you get the fuck outta my shop!

84
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,710
Viggo is not gonna like this.

85
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,580
How do you know what
Viggo likes or doesn't like?

86
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,979
I'll tell you somethin'
he's gonna understand.

87
00:19:26,485 --> 00:19:29,486
You've got a fuckin'
pair on you, old man!

88
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,991
I guess we'll be takin' our
business someplace else.

89
00:19:38,564 --> 00:19:39,930
<i>So what are you gonna do?</i>

90
00:19:51,777 --> 00:19:53,746
I need a ride.

91
00:20:08,727 --> 00:20:09,827
Aurelio speaking.

92
00:20:12,598 --> 00:20:14,798
I heard you struck my son.

93
00:20:15,768 --> 00:20:18,337
- <i>Yes sir, I did.</i>
- And may I ask why?

94
00:20:18,637 --> 00:20:22,141
Yeah. Well, because he stole
John Wick's car, sir.

95
00:20:22,241 --> 00:20:23,889
And...

96
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,572
killed his dog.

97
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,048
Viggo?

98
00:21:03,148 --> 00:21:04,483
Yeah?

99
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:07,119
They've agreed to your terms.

100
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:10,387
I mean, it's not like you gave them
much of a choice anyway, though, right?

101
00:21:13,058 --> 00:21:14,958
Congratulations.

102
00:21:18,463 --> 00:21:19,429
Sir?

103
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,800
Have you seen my son?

104
00:21:41,453 --> 00:21:42,855
How was your trip, kid?

105
00:21:42,955 --> 00:21:45,591
We won't be hearing
from them anytime soon.

106
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:47,457
Or ever.

107
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,552
That's a nice jacket.

108
00:22:13,652 --> 00:22:14,651
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

109
00:22:26,565 --> 00:22:27,499
Should I go?

110
00:22:31,671 --> 00:22:35,141
- Viggo, English, please. Come on...
- Stay, God damn it!

111
00:22:35,241 --> 00:22:36,945
What did I do?

112
00:22:39,611 --> 00:22:42,948
We did what you asked. No one saw shit.

113
00:22:47,152 --> 00:22:49,488
I'm not talking about Atlantic City.

114
00:22:50,722 --> 00:22:52,558
What, then?

115
00:22:52,658 --> 00:22:55,794
You mean Aurelio's?
So I stole a fucking car!

116
00:22:55,994 --> 00:22:57,262
Aw, fuck, Viggo!

117
00:22:57,362 --> 00:22:58,995
- Right, I'll go...
- You stay!

118
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:23,289
It's not what you did, son,
that angers me so.

119
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:28,058
- It's who you did it to.
- Who? The fucking nobody!

120
00:23:29,628 --> 00:23:32,528
That fuckin' nobody...

121
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:35,398
is John Wick.

122
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:53,183
<i>He once was an associate of ours.</i>

123
00:23:55,254 --> 00:23:57,387
They call him Baba Yaga.

124
00:24:00,826 --> 00:24:04,094
- The Boogeyman? - Well,
John wasn't exactly The Boogeyman.

125
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:12,135
He was the one you sent to
kill the fucking Boogeyman.

126
00:24:17,643 --> 00:24:20,310
John is a man of focus,

127
00:24:21,747 --> 00:24:22,746
commitment,

128
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:24,781
sheer will.

129
00:24:26,051 --> 00:24:29,118
Something you know very little about.

130
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:33,956
I once saw him kill three men in a bar.

131
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,561
With a pencil.

132
00:24:37,196 --> 00:24:38,397
With a fuckin'...

133
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:43,299
...pencil.

134
00:24:51,143 --> 00:24:54,577
Then suddenly one day he asked to leave.

135
00:24:55,614 --> 00:24:57,714
It's over a woman, of course.

136
00:25:03,455 --> 00:25:05,855
<i>So I made a deal with him.</i>

137
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:10,660
I gave him an impossible task.

138
00:25:11,863 --> 00:25:15,031
A job no one could have pulled off.

139
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,540
The bodies he buried that day

140
00:25:25,477 --> 00:25:28,378
laid the foundation of what we are now.

141
00:25:32,984 --> 00:25:34,884
And then, my son,

142
00:25:35,587 --> 00:25:38,154
a few days after his wife died,

143
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:40,790
you steal his car

144
00:25:42,394 --> 00:25:44,730
and kill his fuckin' dog.

145
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,530
Father, I can make this right.

146
00:25:49,234 --> 00:25:52,371
- How do you plan that?
- By finishing what I started.

147
00:25:52,471 --> 00:25:54,771
What the... Did he hear
a fucking word I said?

148
00:25:57,442 --> 00:26:00,009
Iosef! Iosef! Listen!

149
00:26:03,115 --> 00:26:05,148
John will come for you.

150
00:26:11,056 --> 00:26:14,593
And you will do nothing,
because you can do nothing.

151
00:26:14,693 --> 00:26:17,727
So get the fuck out of my sight!

152
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:48,457
<i>Hello, John.</i>

153
00:26:51,263 --> 00:26:55,264
I heard about your wife, and I'm sorry.
My condolences.

154
00:26:57,602 --> 00:27:00,591
<i>It... seems to be fate,</i>

155
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:03,188
<i>or happenstance or just bad fuckin' luck</i>

156
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,135
<i>caused our paths to cross once again.</i>

157
00:27:10,515 --> 00:27:11,981
John?

158
00:27:16,321 --> 00:27:19,258
Let us not resort to our baser instincts

159
00:27:19,358 --> 00:27:23,793
<i>and handle this like
civilized men, to move on...</i>

160
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:36,105
What'd he say?

161
00:27:38,777 --> 00:27:41,577
- Enough.
- Oh, God.

162
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:46,683
Task your crew.

163
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:51,788
- How many?
- How many do you have?

164
00:32:01,806 --> 00:32:05,276
- Evenin', John.
- Evenin', Jimmy.

165
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,343
Noise complaint?

166
00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:10,181
Noise complaint.

167
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:25,127
- You, workin' again?
- No, just sortin' some stuff out.

168
00:32:26,131 --> 00:32:28,064
Well...

169
00:32:30,501 --> 00:32:32,334
I'll leave you be, then.

170
00:32:33,004 --> 00:32:35,671
- Good night, John.
- Good night, Jimmy.

171
00:32:51,022 --> 00:32:53,192
This is Wick.

172
00:32:53,492 --> 00:32:55,761
Yes, John Wick, that's right.

173
00:32:55,861 --> 00:32:59,095
I'd like to make a dinner
reservation for 12.

174
00:33:17,982 --> 00:33:19,448
Good to see you, John.

175
00:33:19,951 --> 00:33:21,484
Charlie.

176
00:33:33,865 --> 00:33:35,431
You look good.

177
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:39,635
And here I'd feared
you'd left all this behind.

178
00:34:21,446 --> 00:34:23,179
Will I be hearin' from you anytime soon?

179
00:34:25,617 --> 00:34:26,949
Goodbye, Charlie.

180
00:34:28,319 --> 00:34:29,685
John.

181
00:34:33,892 --> 00:34:35,891
Of course he did.

182
00:34:37,562 --> 00:34:39,498
Put a contract on John Wick.

183
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:42,865
- How much?
- Two million.

184
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:52,341
English, Viggo, please.

185
00:34:55,947 --> 00:35:00,382
Put Iosef in the Red Circle and wait.

186
00:35:01,886 --> 00:35:03,188
For what?

187
00:35:03,388 --> 00:35:06,155
For John Wick, of course.

188
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:32,648
Thank you.

189
00:35:34,452 --> 00:35:36,721
To what do I owe this visit?

190
00:35:40,825 --> 00:35:42,791
I have a job for you.

191
00:35:43,661 --> 00:35:45,196
And I've got a phone.

192
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:50,235
I want to offer you this face to face

193
00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:54,536
seeing as how you
might find it personal.

194
00:35:56,474 --> 00:35:59,208
Would you kill John Wick
for two million dollars?

195
00:36:03,448 --> 00:36:05,414
After all, you were close.

196
00:36:06,885 --> 00:36:10,489
- Is the contract exclusive?
- No, it's open.

197
00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:13,855
It's a timely matter,
it has to be handled quickly.

198
00:36:14,459 --> 00:36:16,125
Consider it done.

199
00:36:17,795 --> 00:36:20,917
Thank you, Marcus.
I know I can trust you.

200
00:36:21,017 --> 00:36:22,898
Thanks for the drink.

201
00:38:26,024 --> 00:38:30,793
- Room 918. Do enjoy your stay.
- Thanks.

202
00:38:33,064 --> 00:38:34,496
Good seeing you again, John.

203
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,865
Perkins.

204
00:38:39,203 --> 00:38:41,406
I have you for two nights.

205
00:38:41,506 --> 00:38:45,210
- Depending on business, it may be more.
- Of course, sir.

206
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,943
So when did the old place
get a facelift?

207
00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:50,115
Around four years ago.

208
00:38:50,215 --> 00:38:53,218
But I assure you, sir,
she really hasn't changed much.

209
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:56,285
- Same owner?
- Same owner.

210
00:39:04,395 --> 00:39:05,594
Room 818.

211
00:39:07,531 --> 00:39:08,880
And, as always,

212
00:39:09,634 --> 00:39:15,370
it is a pleasure having you
with us again, Mr. Wick.

213
00:39:30,421 --> 00:39:32,120
<i>What are you doing, John?</i>

214
00:39:33,091 --> 00:39:34,823
<i>Looking at you.</i>

215
00:39:35,793 --> 00:39:37,392
<i>Come here.</i>

216
00:41:09,987 --> 00:41:11,920
Hello, Winston.

217
00:41:13,624 --> 00:41:15,624
Jonathan.

218
00:41:17,595 --> 00:41:19,397
Now, as I recall,

219
00:41:19,497 --> 00:41:23,768
weren't you the one tasked to dole out
the beatings, not receive them?

220
00:41:23,868 --> 00:41:25,467
Rusty, I guess.

221
00:41:26,437 --> 00:41:28,270
To what do we owe the pleasure?

222
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,974
Iosef Tarasov.

223
00:41:32,943 --> 00:41:35,744
- What about him?
- I'd like to talk with him.

224
00:41:36,447 --> 00:41:39,848
A talk, you say.

225
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,720
I'm familiar with
the parlance, Jonathan.

226
00:41:45,523 --> 00:41:47,892
I want to ask you this.

227
00:41:47,992 --> 00:41:50,258
Have you returned to the fold?

228
00:41:51,162 --> 00:41:53,331
Just visiting.

229
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:55,033
Have you thought this through?

230
00:41:55,633 --> 00:41:59,935
I mean, chewed down to the bone?

231
00:42:00,805 --> 00:42:03,041
You got out once.

232
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:06,141
You dip so much as a pinky
back into this pond,

233
00:42:07,378 --> 00:42:10,882
you may well find something reaches out

234
00:42:10,982 --> 00:42:13,651
and drags you back into its depths.

235
00:42:13,751 --> 00:42:15,717
Where do I find him?

236
00:42:17,755 --> 00:42:19,221
Hey.

237
00:42:19,357 --> 00:42:21,857
Wick's at The Continental.

238
00:42:24,061 --> 00:42:25,931
Welcome home, John.

239
00:42:26,531 --> 00:42:28,764
We have a contact there who's
willing to take him out for us.

240
00:42:29,367 --> 00:42:30,799
Yeah?

241
00:42:31,702 --> 00:42:33,669
How brazen.

242
00:42:35,873 --> 00:42:39,644
If they're willing to break the rules
of Continental, double the bounty.

243
00:42:40,044 --> 00:42:42,080
You know the rules.

244
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,503
No business can be conducted
on these premises lest

245
00:42:45,603 --> 00:42:48,535
incurring heavy penalties.

246
00:42:51,489 --> 00:42:53,088
Have a drink

247
00:42:54,692 --> 00:42:56,792
and relax.

248
00:42:58,763 --> 00:42:59,842
For now.

249
00:43:04,134 --> 00:43:06,034
It's personal.

250
00:43:11,609 --> 00:43:14,445
Holy shit! Jonathan!

251
00:43:14,545 --> 00:43:16,714
- Hey, Addy.
- My God!

252
00:43:16,814 --> 00:43:20,819
- How long has it been? Four years?
- Five and change.

253
00:43:21,019 --> 00:43:24,655
So tell me, how was
life on the other side?

254
00:43:24,755 --> 00:43:26,079
It was good, Addy.

255
00:43:26,657 --> 00:43:28,990
Far better than I deserved.

256
00:43:29,994 --> 00:43:33,395
- Hey, I'm sorry to hear about your...
- Thanks.

257
00:43:34,999 --> 00:43:37,299
I've never seen you like this.

258
00:43:37,902 --> 00:43:38,867
Like what?

259
00:43:40,004 --> 00:43:41,470
Vulnerable.

260
00:43:43,607 --> 00:43:47,776
- I'm retired. - Not if you're
drinkin' here, you're not.

261
00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:50,981
- Usual?
- Please.

262
00:43:57,588 --> 00:43:59,221
Compliments of the house.

263
00:44:00,024 --> 00:44:01,557
Thanks.

264
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:11,922
Did you see the tits on that girl?

265
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:16,994
Better hope Lita is working tonight.

266
00:46:33,511 --> 00:46:35,746
Are you scared of the fuckin' boogeyman?

267
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,785
- I'm not.
- No.

268
00:46:38,886 --> 00:46:40,782
But you should be.

269
00:46:45,089 --> 00:46:47,188
I want another bottle!

270
00:46:48,692 --> 00:46:51,526
Right fuckin' now! Go get me a bottle!

271
00:46:52,029 --> 00:46:53,695
Come on!

272
00:47:01,772 --> 00:47:03,738
Hello, Francis.

273
00:47:04,508 --> 00:47:06,207
Mr. Wick.

274
00:47:13,517 --> 00:47:15,984
Are you here on business, sir?

275
00:47:16,654 --> 00:47:18,720
Afraid so, Francis.

276
00:47:19,223 --> 00:47:21,256
Why don't you take the night off.

277
00:47:27,331 --> 00:47:28,697
Thank you, sir.

278
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:01,329
Fuck you, motherfucker!

279
00:48:08,172 --> 00:48:10,138
Where is Iosef?

280
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:14,945
Bath house, downstairs.

281
00:50:18,802 --> 00:50:20,168
Go!

282
00:51:28,205 --> 00:51:29,837
John Wick's there. Go get him!

283
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:52,928
Move! He's here! He's fucking here!
He's there! He's coming!

284
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:35,330
Get in! Get in!

285
00:53:35,999 --> 00:53:37,000
Come on, come on!

286
00:55:22,172 --> 00:55:25,008
- Good evening, Mr. Wick.
- Good evening.

287
00:55:25,108 --> 00:55:27,911
- How may I be of service?
- Is the doctor in?

288
00:55:28,011 --> 00:55:30,707
- Yes, sir. 24/7.
- Then send him up, please.

289
00:55:30,807 --> 00:55:32,981
- Yes, sir.
- How good's your laundry?

290
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:37,852
I'm sorry to say that
no one's that good.

291
00:55:38,655 --> 00:55:41,291
No. I thought not.

292
00:55:41,391 --> 00:55:44,194
May I suggest a drink, sir.

293
00:55:44,294 --> 00:55:46,493
Bourbon, perhaps.

294
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:49,363
That sounds perfect.

295
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,682
So what sort of movement
am I looking at?

296
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:08,218
Well, if you're lookin' to heal,

297
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:09,955
then keep it marginal.

298
00:56:12,055 --> 00:56:16,557
However, if you still have
business to attend to,

299
00:56:19,029 --> 00:56:21,295
take two of these beforehand.

300
00:56:22,566 --> 00:56:25,800
Your stitches'll tear and you'll bleed,

301
00:56:26,236 --> 00:56:28,839
but you'll have full function.

302
00:56:28,939 --> 00:56:30,905
Do you need anything for the pain?

303
00:56:32,442 --> 00:56:34,575
No, I've got that covered.

304
00:57:41,645 --> 00:57:42,644
Hey, John.

305
00:57:46,149 --> 00:57:48,483
- Perkins?
- I thought I'd let myself in.

306
00:57:50,253 --> 00:57:51,976
I noticed.

307
00:57:59,296 --> 00:58:02,232
I never knew Ms. Perkins to get
out of bed for less than three.

308
00:58:02,332 --> 00:58:04,101
Viggo's giving me four
to break hotel rules.

309
00:58:04,201 --> 00:58:06,567
That's unwise, I assure you.

310
00:58:12,842 --> 00:58:14,577
You were always a pussy.

311
00:59:30,353 --> 00:59:31,218
Yes?

312
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:34,524
<i>I apologize for calling you
at this hour, but...</i>

313
00:59:34,824 --> 00:59:39,961
we have received a number of grievances
from your floor concerning the noise.

314
00:59:42,298 --> 00:59:45,335
My apologies. I was dealing with...

315
00:59:45,705 --> 00:59:49,206
- an uninvited guest.
<i>- Have you need then of, say,</i>

316
00:59:49,706 --> 00:59:51,541
a dinner reservation, perhaps?

317
00:59:51,741 --> 00:59:54,444
Perhaps. I'll have to get back to you.

318
01:00:02,419 --> 01:00:03,418
No!

319
01:00:05,121 --> 01:00:07,490
- Where's Iosef?
- Fuck you.

320
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:10,049
- Where's Viggo?
- I'm not telling you shit!

321
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,828
Do you really wanna die here, Perkins?

322
01:00:15,098 --> 01:00:16,997
Give me somethin'.

323
01:00:21,438 --> 01:00:25,409
Little Russia.
There's a church near Cannon Court.

324
01:00:25,809 --> 01:00:28,178
- <i>What about it?</i>
- <i>It's a front.</i>

325
01:00:28,478 --> 01:00:30,144
It's where Viggo keeps
his private stash.

326
01:00:32,916 --> 01:00:33,881
Thank you.

327
01:00:40,857 --> 01:00:42,790
Do I know you?

328
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,993
I'm thinkin' so.

329
01:00:52,902 --> 01:00:56,406
- Hey, John.
- Hey, Harry.

330
01:00:56,506 --> 01:00:58,041
Everything all right?

331
01:00:58,141 --> 01:01:01,475
Yeah. Everything's fine.

332
01:01:02,011 --> 01:01:05,079
- I'll leave you to it, then.
- Hey, Harry?

333
01:01:06,449 --> 01:01:10,120
You keen on earning a coin?
Babysittin' the sleepin' one?

334
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:13,220
- Catch and release?
- Catch and release.

335
01:01:44,521 --> 01:01:47,087
My son, how might I help you?

336
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:54,929
Motherfucker!

337
01:02:05,675 --> 01:02:07,705
Let's go to the vault.

338
01:02:19,422 --> 01:02:20,821
Open it.

339
01:02:27,864 --> 01:02:29,030
Viggo will kill me.

340
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:48,782
Ladies, out.

341
01:03:01,598 --> 01:03:05,568
Honestly, what do you think you're
going to do with all of that?

342
01:03:05,668 --> 01:03:06,732
This.

343
01:03:55,785 --> 01:03:57,618
Don't worry.

344
01:03:58,655 --> 01:04:00,621
Housekeeping will find you.

345
01:04:01,324 --> 01:04:03,226
Treat all your ladies like this?

346
01:04:03,326 --> 01:04:06,927
You are no lady. Trust me.

347
01:04:13,402 --> 01:04:15,602
Harry, is it?

348
01:04:17,674 --> 01:04:20,307
How'd you like to earn more
than just a gold coin?

349
01:04:23,179 --> 01:04:27,985
You've broken the rules. You've done
business on Continental grounds.

350
01:04:28,885 --> 01:04:33,620
And management does not take
kindly to that sort of behavior.

351
01:04:35,024 --> 01:04:36,757
Fuck management.

352
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:46,100
Don't worry. Housekeeping will find you.

353
01:04:52,742 --> 01:04:55,009
Ashes to ashes.

354
01:04:55,812 --> 01:04:57,280
Can we recover from this?

355
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:58,748
Viggo, you know what
was in that vault, right?

356
01:04:58,848 --> 01:05:00,549
It was nothing.

357
01:05:04,787 --> 01:05:06,286
Shit!

358
01:05:23,139 --> 01:05:24,605
Come on!

359
01:06:42,051 --> 01:06:44,421
I'll say this, John.

360
01:06:44,721 --> 01:06:47,888
They sure as fuck broke
the mold with you.

361
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,793
Ay, ay...

362
01:07:01,604 --> 01:07:03,740
You always had a certain...

363
01:07:05,308 --> 01:07:07,241
...audacity about you, you know.

364
01:07:08,177 --> 01:07:10,444
Right? Oh, yeah.

365
01:07:13,816 --> 01:07:18,585
I can say you're still very
much the John Wick of old.

366
01:07:19,588 --> 01:07:21,188
Am I?

367
01:07:24,327 --> 01:07:27,894
People don't change. You know that.

368
01:07:28,264 --> 01:07:30,597
Times, they do.

369
01:07:34,103 --> 01:07:36,396
Do you know what was in that vault?

370
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:42,011
Artwork, cash, not without its worth,
but the leverage I had on this city,

371
01:07:42,211 --> 01:07:47,681
audio recordings, physical evidence,
blackmail, it was fuckin' priceless!

372
01:07:48,684 --> 01:07:50,217
Priceless!

373
01:07:52,789 --> 01:07:55,459
Yeah. I kind of enjoyed that.

374
01:07:57,504 --> 01:08:00,524
Yeah, I know you did. Yeah.

375
01:08:01,564 --> 01:08:02,667
Are you really laughing?

376
01:08:10,139 --> 01:08:11,638
So...

377
01:08:15,077 --> 01:08:17,844
Then you got married? Settled down.

378
01:08:18,548 --> 01:08:20,814
How did you manage that anyways?

379
01:08:21,317 --> 01:08:22,750
Luck, I guess.

380
01:08:23,753 --> 01:08:25,522
Yeah.

381
01:08:26,022 --> 01:08:28,858
Yeah, while you had your wife,
I had my son.

382
01:08:28,958 --> 01:08:32,826
And believe me,
you had a far better deal.

383
01:08:37,466 --> 01:08:39,002
And then you left.

384
01:08:39,302 --> 01:08:41,337
And the way you got out,

385
01:08:41,437 --> 01:08:44,479
lying to yourself that the past

386
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:48,686
held no sway over the future.
But in the end,

387
01:08:50,413 --> 01:08:55,151
a lot of us are rewarded
for our misdeeds,

388
01:08:55,251 --> 01:08:58,986
which is why God took your wife

389
01:09:00,556 --> 01:09:03,390
and unleashed you upon me.

390
01:09:04,861 --> 01:09:07,243
This life...

391
01:09:07,756 --> 01:09:09,852
follows you.

392
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:13,903
It clings to you,

393
01:09:14,003 --> 01:09:19,042
infecting everyone who
comes close to you.

394
01:09:19,142 --> 01:09:22,542
We are cursed, you and I.

395
01:09:23,712 --> 01:09:27,047
On that we agree.

396
01:09:30,953 --> 01:09:33,153
Finally, common ground.

397
01:09:34,223 --> 01:09:37,493
- Okay.
- Step aside.

398
01:09:37,793 --> 01:09:40,123
Give me your son.

399
01:09:40,897 --> 01:09:42,962
John Wick.

400
01:09:48,171 --> 01:09:51,774
It was just a fucking car!
Just a fuckin' dog!

401
01:09:52,174 --> 01:09:53,707
Just a dog...

402
01:09:55,011 --> 01:09:56,610
Viggo?

403
01:09:58,113 --> 01:10:01,382
- Yeah.
- When Helen died, I lost everything.

404
01:10:02,652 --> 01:10:05,722
Until that dog arrived on my doorstep.

405
01:10:06,022 --> 01:10:08,658
A final gift from my wife.

406
01:10:09,158 --> 01:10:13,226
In that moment, I received
some semblance of hope.

407
01:10:15,164 --> 01:10:18,398
An opportunity to grieve unalone.

408
01:10:19,835 --> 01:10:22,102
And your son

409
01:10:22,505 --> 01:10:24,106
took that from me!

410
01:10:24,306 --> 01:10:27,210
- Oh, come on...
- Stole that from me!

411
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:30,079
Killed that from me!

412
01:10:30,179 --> 01:10:32,715
People keep asking if I'm back.

413
01:10:32,815 --> 01:10:35,518
And I haven't really had an answer.

414
01:10:35,618 --> 01:10:39,022
But now, yeah, I'm thinkin' I'm back!

415
01:10:39,122 --> 01:10:42,225
So you can either hand over your son...

416
01:10:42,325 --> 01:10:45,995
or you can die screaming alongside him!

417
01:13:23,052 --> 01:13:24,985
Cool it, cool it, cool it,
cool it, cool it!

418
01:13:25,988 --> 01:13:27,554
John!

419
01:13:29,492 --> 01:13:31,091
- Where is he?
- Shit.

420
01:13:32,962 --> 01:13:34,794
Shit!

421
01:13:39,035 --> 01:13:41,204
I have your word that
if I tell you where he is,

422
01:13:41,604 --> 01:13:44,871
- you'll let me walk away?
- Pull the contract.

423
01:13:49,612 --> 01:13:50,511
Done.

424
01:13:55,551 --> 01:13:58,154
He's kept in a safe house. Brooklyn.

425
01:13:58,254 --> 01:14:01,020
434 Wallace Place.

426
01:14:02,991 --> 01:14:06,992
- They know you're coming.
- Of course. But it won't matter.

427
01:14:59,882 --> 01:15:01,615
Will you stop playing
the fucking video game?

428
01:15:15,264 --> 01:15:18,300
Will you stop playing
that fucking video game?

429
01:15:29,845 --> 01:15:31,044
Get down, get down!

430
01:15:40,756 --> 01:15:42,989
Come on, come on! Get down, get down!

431
01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:03,836
Make the arrangements.

432
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:23,189
Thank you.

433
01:17:23,726 --> 01:17:25,758
Our pleasure, sir.

434
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:31,968
A parting gift. From the management.

435
01:17:32,268 --> 01:17:35,568
Compensation for last
night's unfortunate...

436
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,404
incident.

437
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:27,723
How many times do I
have to save your ass?

438
01:18:27,823 --> 01:18:30,826
- I appreciate it.
- Of course.

439
01:18:31,026 --> 01:18:34,697
- You look terrible.
- No, I look retired.

440
01:18:34,797 --> 01:18:38,398
Retired? You really believe that?

441
01:18:52,248 --> 01:18:54,714
You made a new life.

442
01:18:56,185 --> 01:18:58,384
You'll find your way back to it.

443
01:18:59,888 --> 01:19:01,721
It's time to go home.

444
01:19:55,377 --> 01:19:59,214
Let's get on with this,
whatever the fuck this is.

445
01:19:59,314 --> 01:20:01,247
Hello, Marcus.

446
01:20:13,862 --> 01:20:15,061
This is John.

447
01:20:16,498 --> 01:20:19,699
I appreciate you granting
my son a swift death.

448
01:20:22,037 --> 01:20:24,871
<i>I wouldn't know how
to reply to that either.</i>

449
01:20:26,675 --> 01:20:29,509
Marcus betrayed me.

450
01:20:39,755 --> 01:20:43,357
- You pulled the contract.
- And while it was open,

451
01:20:43,557 --> 01:20:46,584
you had every chance,

452
01:20:46,895 --> 01:20:50,065
every opportunity to kill John Wick.

453
01:20:50,165 --> 01:20:53,168
And if you had done your job,

454
01:20:53,268 --> 01:20:55,769
my son would be still alive!

455
01:20:58,273 --> 01:21:02,575
And in so doing,
he broke the cardinal rule.

456
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:06,012
Thank you.

457
01:21:09,384 --> 01:21:11,227
Ms. Perkins.

458
01:21:12,154 --> 01:21:14,156
Why am I not surprised?

459
01:21:14,556 --> 01:21:16,556
In for a penny, in for a pound.

460
01:21:18,126 --> 01:21:21,461
<i>So, John, I had no choice.</i>

461
01:21:22,564 --> 01:21:24,731
I always liked you, Marcus.

462
01:21:26,068 --> 01:21:28,268
The last of the old guard.

463
01:21:37,012 --> 01:21:41,014
But unlike the others,
you go out on my terms.

464
01:21:42,317 --> 01:21:44,550
God! No!

465
01:21:46,722 --> 01:21:48,621
No, my good sir.

466
01:21:50,058 --> 01:21:51,958
I go out on my own.

467
01:22:13,715 --> 01:22:14,814
See?

468
01:22:26,561 --> 01:22:28,827
Well played, old friend.

469
01:22:35,137 --> 01:22:37,005
We done, Viggo?

470
01:22:37,364 --> 01:22:40,473
- We're done.
- Okay. Here.

471
01:22:40,776 --> 01:22:42,632
Thank you.

472
01:22:45,313 --> 01:22:47,747
Yeah. Fuel the chopper.

473
01:23:10,272 --> 01:23:14,841
<i>Ms. Perkins, I apologize
for calling you at this hour.</i>

474
01:23:57,653 --> 01:23:59,455
Ms. Perkins,

475
01:23:59,855 --> 01:24:04,118
your membership to the Continental
has been, by thine own hand,

476
01:24:04,218 --> 01:24:05,991
revoked.

477
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:34,656
<i>I know what you're thinking, Jonathan.</i>

478
01:24:34,756 --> 01:24:36,328
<i>We live by a code.</i>

479
01:24:36,428 --> 01:24:38,763
Which is why I'm not the one
telling you that a certain helicopter

480
01:24:38,863 --> 01:24:42,795
at a certain helipad is being
fueled for a certain someone.

481
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:04,083
- Have you got my cigarettes?
- Yeah, I got your cigarettes.

482
01:25:27,843 --> 01:25:29,042
Oh, fuck!

483
01:25:32,614 --> 01:25:35,040
Yeah. Super. Come on, let's go. Faster!
The helicopter's right down there.

484
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:36,215
Come on! Let's go!

485
01:25:49,331 --> 01:25:50,532
Shit!

486
01:25:50,632 --> 01:25:52,999
Goddamn, I knew he'd come.

487
01:26:07,115 --> 01:26:08,517
What's fuckin' wrong with this guy?

488
01:26:09,217 --> 01:26:11,117
Somebody give me a gun. Who's got a gun?

489
01:26:13,288 --> 01:26:14,739
Oh, God!

490
01:26:16,524 --> 01:26:19,259
- That was a good one.
- Who's got a gun?

491
01:26:35,918 --> 01:26:36,693
Fuck!

492
01:26:53,628 --> 01:26:56,262
Viggo, the helicopters, right over
there. We have to get over there.

493
01:27:13,815 --> 01:27:14,981
Oh, my God, I need a gun.

494
01:27:37,339 --> 01:27:39,739
- English, please.
- Good luck.

495
01:27:41,309 --> 01:27:42,358
Russian cocksucker.

496
01:27:44,546 --> 01:27:46,211
Fuck!

497
01:28:11,339 --> 01:28:12,027
No!

498
01:29:15,770 --> 01:29:18,037
No more guns, John.

499
01:29:20,108 --> 01:29:22,141
No more bullets.

500
01:29:22,744 --> 01:29:24,777
No more bullets.

501
01:29:32,654 --> 01:29:34,720
Just you and me, John.

502
01:29:35,490 --> 01:29:36,622
You and me.

503
01:30:00,248 --> 01:30:02,584
What happened, John?

504
01:30:02,684 --> 01:30:05,353
We were professionals. Civilized.

505
01:30:05,553 --> 01:30:07,520
Do I look civilized to you?

506
01:31:30,405 --> 01:31:32,538
Be seeing you, John.

507
01:31:34,675 --> 01:31:36,341
Yeah.

508
01:31:36,944 --> 01:31:39,011
Be seeing you.

509
01:32:29,564 --> 01:32:31,391
<i>Come on, John.</i>

510
01:32:31,691 --> 01:32:33,501
<i>Let's go home.</i>

511
01:34:17,221 --> 01:34:19,138
It's okay.

512
01:34:19,877 --> 01:34:21,140
Let's go home.
