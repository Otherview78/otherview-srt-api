<i>Can we preserve our past
and all its wondrous heritage?</i>

4
00:00:52,255 --> 00:00:55,795
<i>Or will we too fall victim,
like old Rome,</i>

5
00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:59,795

- Please.

- Like, for breakfast.

I hate and I love, why do I so,

18
00:04:25,755 --> 00:04:28,129
perhaps you ask?

19
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,170
- All right, let's go.
- You think so?

20
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:32,588

Go.

36
00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:04,254

39
00:06:08,921 --> 00:06:10,212
We'll apologise.

40
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:12,754
Apologise?
After the building's down?

41
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:14,504

Could be.

Come out with me.

- I can't. I'm sorry.
- Why?

147
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,295
My jurisdiction
covers parks and fairs,

148
00:11:58,296 --> 00:12:01,004
and we've already issued
the necessary bonds

149
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:02,505
to develop this site.

00:12:07,838 --> 00:12:09,670
<i>The Mayor's show for the honchos</i>

151
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:11,712

00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:13,379
<i>especially with Cesar Catilina,</i>

153
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,837
<i>whom I am acquainted,</i>

<i>denying my requests for a comment.</i>

155
00:12:16,963 --> 00:12:20,045
I cleared this site
to create something to inspire people.

156
00:12:20,046 --> 00:12:22,004
People? Wha...

157
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:25,046
When have you ever even cared
about people, Catilina?

158
00:12:28,338 --> 00:12:30,337
A city that people can dream about.

159
00:12:30,338 --> 00:12:32,545
People don't need dreams.

160
00:12:32,546 --> 00:12:35,129
They need teachers, sanitation, jobs.

161
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,795
The "need" is to create something

162
00:12:36,796 --> 00:12:39,545
that lives on
after a City Fair, Mayor.

163
00:12:39,546 --> 00:12:42,795
Which is why Megalopolis will be built
entirely out of the Megalon,

164
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,087
which is imperishable.

165
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:45,712
The Megalon is unsafe!

166
00:12:45,713 --> 00:12:49,754
Concrete, concrete, concrete,

167
00:12:49,755 --> 00:12:53,046
and steel, steel, steel is safe!

168
00:12:53,755 --> 00:12:56,045
Imagine today's society

169
00:12:56,046 --> 00:13:00,463
a branch of civilisation
about to reach a dead-end...

170
00:13:01,338 --> 00:13:03,921
Humanity as an old tree

171
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,921
with one misguided branch
called "civilisation..."

172
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,045
going nowhere.

173
00:13:14,046 --> 00:13:16,795
I like trees as much as the next guy,

174
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,212
but we're not here to discuss trees.

175
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:21,670
People need help,
and they need it now!

176
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:24,004
No. Don't let the now
destroy the forever.

177
00:13:24,005 --> 00:13:26,545
We are talking about people.

178
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:28,254
<i>People, Catilina,</i>

179
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:31,045
and how they live now.

180
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:33,546
No time to talk of
people's future?

181
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,045
Yet there's always time
to convince them

182
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:38,795
to use money they don't have,

183
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:40,670
to buy things they don't need,

184
00:13:40,671 --> 00:13:43,254
to imitate people they don't like.

185
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,629
Which makes you the chief slumlord

186
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,212
and the Mayor of the city of nothing.

187
00:13:48,213 --> 00:13:51,129
You call me that again,
and I will smash your face.

188
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,587
Easy, gentlemen.

189
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:05,004
Were you so cool and collected

190
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:08,045
when you poisoned your wife
and her body disappeared?

191
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:10,837
Is Megalon, your miracle method,

192
00:14:10,838 --> 00:14:12,587
made from her body?

193
00:14:12,588 --> 00:14:17,088
Is your poor Sunny Hope
a plastic girder somewhere?

194
00:14:18,796 --> 00:14:20,213
A wall panel?

195
00:14:22,088 --> 00:14:23,296
What really happened?

196
00:14:24,213 --> 00:14:27,046
Well, you were the prosecuting DA,

197
00:14:28,046 --> 00:14:29,587
so you know I was acquitted.

198
00:14:29,588 --> 00:14:32,462
- And you're still a slumlord.
- I am not a slumlord!

199
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:34,045
You will not stand here

200
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:36,045
- and call me a slumlord.
- No, no, no.

201
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:38,504
No. No, no,
I am not a slumlord!

202
00:14:38,505 --> 00:14:40,879
- Stop. I'm...
- You will never call me that!

203
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,170
Easy. Easy, Frank, calm down!

204
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:44,671
- No! No!
- Hold him.

205
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:46,879
I'm so sorry.

206
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,295
Is that what we're playing?

207
00:14:48,296 --> 00:14:50,005
Three-year-old games.

208
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:53,170
Thank you.

209
00:14:53,171 --> 00:14:55,504
Hit it, Jerry!

210
00:14:55,505 --> 00:14:59,045
<i>I'm Wow Platinum,
and that is the score</i>

211
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:02,670
<i>Come for me on the trading room floor</i>

212
00:15:02,671 --> 00:15:04,004
<i>Every weekday at 9:00 am.</i>

213
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:05,255
<i>Mwah!</i>

214
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,629
<i>The great ladies of Rome</i>

215
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,004
<i>obsessed over fashion
while having intimate dealings</i>

216
00:15:12,005 --> 00:15:14,712
<i>with the scum
of the gladiatorial shows,</i>

217
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:17,129
<i>poisoners, and blackmailers.</i>

218
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:21,212
I really want to take him down
for being so nasty to my father.

219
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:22,879
Yeah, right?

220
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:26,920
Okay, we're gonna write him
a poison-pen letter.

221
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:28,795
I'm very, very good at those.

222
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:31,046
Let's kick his ass.

223
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,295
- A devil?
- Yeah.

224
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:36,379
Give him a little moustache.

225
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,004
He's still kind of hot though.

226
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,755
- Who?
- It's your cousin.

227
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,880
My cousin? Really?

228
00:15:43,796 --> 00:15:44,796
You're bad.

229
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:55,796
You should wear that.

230
00:15:57,838 --> 00:15:59,838
Fucking clown.

231
00:16:02,088 --> 00:16:04,046
- I think I hate your brother.
- I do too.

232
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:08,005
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

233
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:11,046
My God. My fucking God.

234
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,130
Yeah, I will, I fucking will.

235
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,296
<i>Yes, we do.</i>

236
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:53,045
<i>When you were 22,
your buildings created the future.</i>

237
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:57,130
<i>But now your nephew, this genius,
he says they are obsolete.</i>

238
00:17:00,255 --> 00:17:03,712
<i>I still have
some powder in my pistol, I must say.</i>

239
00:17:03,713 --> 00:17:04,921
<i>Is that right?</i>

240
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,087
Have you no concept of time?

241
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:11,254
For God's sake, turn yourself off.

242
00:17:11,255 --> 00:17:13,629
<i>Like most geniuses, he can be...</i>

243
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,379
You were in that car
and you didn't take my call.

244
00:17:22,463 --> 00:17:24,463
I waited till I had
good news to share.

245
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:29,379
Fuck your stupid Megalopolis!

246
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,879
Wow, it's the beginning
of the discussions.

247
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,963
It means more to you than I do.

248
00:17:34,963 --> 00:17:37,295
Conversation, it isn't enough.

249
00:17:37,296 --> 00:17:39,587
It's the questions
that lead it to the next step,

250
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:41,388
but initially you have
to have a conversation.

251
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:44,587
The city itself is immaterial,

252
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:47,045
but they're talking about it,
for the first time.

253
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:49,254
And it's not just about us
talking about it,

254
00:17:49,255 --> 00:17:51,421
it's the need to talk about it.

255
00:17:53,213 --> 00:17:55,879
It's as urgent to us as air,
and water, and...

256
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,421
Is it getting messier in here?

257
00:17:58,046 --> 00:17:59,338
Mess? What mess?

258
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
Come on,

259
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:11,046
you're an obsessive-compulsive
wacko, Cesar.

260
00:18:11,546 --> 00:18:13,005
You're anal as hell.

261
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,921
I, on the other hand,

262
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:22,088
am oral as hell.

263
00:18:28,838 --> 00:18:30,713
What about your bad habits?

264
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:33,213
I'm trying to improve.

265
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:36,754
Well, I'm bored being your mistress.

266
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:39,671
I need to be half of a power couple.

267
00:18:40,713 --> 00:18:41,755
Which half?

268
00:18:45,296 --> 00:18:50,671
Whichever half you want
to put your giant foot on.

269
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:54,588
My career is beginning to slump,

270
00:18:55,671 --> 00:18:57,338
my ratings are down,

271
00:18:58,755 --> 00:18:59,880
and now

272
00:19:01,046 --> 00:19:03,004
I need more.

273
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:09,546
Cesar. Cesar.

274
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:16,005
I love you.

275
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:18,921
I love you with all my heart.

276
00:19:20,421 --> 00:19:21,838
Really, I do.

277
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:33,296
Never marry for love.

278
00:19:36,088 --> 00:19:37,130
<i>Cesar...</i>

279
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,129
<i>Why would you say such a thing?</i>

280
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:15,129
<i>Are you trying to deflect
from my amorous behaviour?</i>

281
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,212
<i>No, I'm just trying to do
a goddamn interview, come on.</i>

282
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:20,171
<i>Is there anything that you don't have?</i>

283
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,171
<i>There certainly is, young lady.</i>

284
00:20:25,588 --> 00:20:27,130
<i>There certainly is.</i>

285
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,587
I'd like to see Dr Catilina.

286
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:46,087
About what?

287
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:48,045
The future of the world.

288
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:49,630
That.

289
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:53,295
<i>Boss,
some sixth grader is here...</i>

290
00:20:53,296 --> 00:20:54,670
And did she say I was tall?

291
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:57,587
<i>She remembers you talked to her class
because it got them out of gym.</i>

292
00:20:57,588 --> 00:21:00,087
I know the one.
Okay, go ahead and send her up.

293
00:21:00,088 --> 00:21:02,255
What if what connects power
also stores it?

294
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:04,213
Good idea.

295
00:21:05,213 --> 00:21:06,213
Thank you.

296
00:21:07,171 --> 00:21:08,670
I like that idea myself.

297
00:21:11,588 --> 00:21:14,962
She's on her way up, Chief.
She ain't what you expected.

298
00:21:14,963 --> 00:21:17,213
- My great expectations?
- No.

299
00:21:35,088 --> 00:21:36,296
Holy Jesus Christ.

300
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,920
Aren't you a bit big
for a sixth grader?

301
00:21:40,171 --> 00:21:42,504
I sent a letter to you last night.

302
00:21:42,505 --> 00:21:46,255
A, childish letter,
and I want it back before you read it.

303
00:21:48,255 --> 00:21:49,296
Childish...

304
00:21:54,255 --> 00:21:55,296
No.

305
00:22:00,796 --> 00:22:02,170
That one.

306
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:03,754
May I have it, please?

307
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:06,587
Unfortunately, I have already read it.

308
00:22:06,588 --> 00:22:08,670
And yes, it was childish.

309
00:22:08,671 --> 00:22:11,170
I had help,
and we weren't in our right minds.

310
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:15,212
But witty, I'd say,
in a cruel and insulting way.

311
00:22:15,213 --> 00:22:17,212
Well, I think the way
you treat the mayor

312
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:18,462
is cruel and insulting.

313
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:21,005
Defending your father
is admirable, Julia Cicero,

314
00:22:21,588 --> 00:22:23,754
as delinquent as usual.

315
00:22:23,755 --> 00:22:27,045
I'm turning over a new leaf,
don't mess with me.

316
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:29,963
I'm not messing,
you're the one who came in disguise.

317
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,920
I finished a year of medical school.

318
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:36,546
One year of medical school.
Were you kicked out?

319
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,962
I was not. I dropped out.

320
00:22:39,963 --> 00:22:41,088
I wonder why.

321
00:22:43,381 --> 00:22:47,045
I guess you could say
my love of science

322
00:22:47,046 --> 00:22:49,296
bumped up against a brick wall of...

323
00:22:50,505 --> 00:22:51,879
intellectual vigour

324
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,212
on the subject of jellyfish.

325
00:22:54,213 --> 00:22:57,880
Their mesoglea material
is a flexible skeleton, unique...

326
00:22:58,505 --> 00:23:04,088
until encountering something higher,
almost spiritual...

327
00:23:05,463 --> 00:23:07,254
like the Megalon.

328
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:09,046
Look, a real Nobel Prize.

329
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:13,255
Expired?

330
00:23:13,256 --> 00:23:15,045
Nobel Prizes don't expire.

331
00:23:15,046 --> 00:23:16,295
I meant your medication.

332
00:23:16,296 --> 00:23:18,337
What I'm curious about
is the Mayor's take

333
00:23:18,338 --> 00:23:19,670
on your absurd behaviour.

334
00:23:19,671 --> 00:23:21,920
You ask my father
about people living as I do,

335
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:23,004
and he's shocked.

336
00:23:23,005 --> 00:23:24,421
What's shocking about you?

337
00:23:25,088 --> 00:23:28,546
I want to be the Statue of Liberty!

338
00:23:30,838 --> 00:23:31,838
I see.

339
00:23:32,588 --> 00:23:34,670
The gossip columns say that you...

340
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:36,170
Ooh, you read gossip columns.

341
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:37,337
Whatever for?

342
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:38,546
To waste time.

343
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:41,754
You have so much of it
you can waste it?

344
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:42,880
Sometime.

345
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,421
Dear.

346
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,045
Lots of empty bottles.

347
00:23:54,046 --> 00:23:57,254
You know, I was reading
about you last night, where you said,

348
00:23:57,255 --> 00:24:00,837
"In order to understand time,
consciousness, courage,

349
00:24:00,838 --> 00:24:03,963
"you must identify it in yourself".

350
00:24:12,713 --> 00:24:15,588
You really must have been
a rude and spoiled child.

351
00:24:17,838 --> 00:24:18,921
As you are now?

352
00:24:20,796 --> 00:24:23,588
So, do you still have
your med school microscope?

353
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:27,337
No, I sold it when I dropped out,

354
00:24:27,338 --> 00:24:28,421
to buy drugs.

355
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:30,795
Psilocybin, of course.

356
00:24:30,796 --> 00:24:32,713
And who supports your lifestyle now,

357
00:24:33,755 --> 00:24:34,755
Daddy?

358
00:24:35,671 --> 00:24:37,420
I hope I didn't ruin your breakfast.

359
00:24:37,421 --> 00:24:40,254
- Come back.
- What for?

360
00:24:40,255 --> 00:24:42,337
Well, for laughs, of course.

361
00:24:42,338 --> 00:24:44,171
What else did you come here for?

362
00:24:45,421 --> 00:24:47,337
I was trying to be a go-between.

363
00:24:47,338 --> 00:24:50,296
You want to help me.

364
00:24:50,796 --> 00:24:52,421
Yeah. And, well, I...

365
00:24:54,671 --> 00:24:55,838
Well, I want to learn.

366
00:24:56,838 --> 00:24:59,129
And you think one year
of medical school

367
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,254
entitles you to plough
through the riches

368
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:02,754
of my Emersonian mind?

369
00:25:02,755 --> 00:25:04,212
- Entitles me?
- Yes.

370
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:09,255
- Entitles me?
- Yes.

371
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:13,005
You have no idea about me.

372
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,587
You think I'm nothing,
just a socialite...

373
00:25:16,588 --> 00:25:17,795
No, not nothing,

374
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:20,295
but I reserve my time
for people who can think.

375
00:25:20,296 --> 00:25:25,380
About science and literature
and architecture and art.

376
00:25:26,796 --> 00:25:30,837
You find me cruel,
selfish and unfeeling? I am.

377
00:25:30,838 --> 00:25:33,545
I work without caring
what happens to either of us.

378
00:25:33,546 --> 00:25:36,670
So go back to the club, "bare it all",

379
00:25:36,671 --> 00:25:38,962
and stalk the kind of people
that you enjoy.

380
00:25:38,963 --> 00:25:41,005
Fine. I will!

381
00:25:42,796 --> 00:25:44,796
Come back
when you have more time.

382
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:46,963
Yes.

383
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,213
I saw you change the laws of physics.

384
00:25:51,255 --> 00:25:53,295
Could it be the great Cesar Catilina

385
00:25:53,296 --> 00:25:55,796
doesn't obey anything,
not even T-symmetry?

386
00:25:58,255 --> 00:25:59,463
What did you see?

387
00:26:01,338 --> 00:26:03,171
I was hoping you'd tell me.

388
00:26:25,505 --> 00:26:26,630
Interesting.

389
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,630
Follow me.

390
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:44,795
<i>It is the daughter
of his rival Cicero standing here,</i>

391
00:26:44,796 --> 00:26:48,504
<i>the offspring of Cesar's opposition.
And yet...</i>

392
00:26:48,505 --> 00:26:49,588
I like her.

393
00:26:54,296 --> 00:26:55,296
This is it?

394
00:27:02,338 --> 00:27:03,671
Walk into the future.

395
00:27:06,088 --> 00:27:07,338
With your eyes closed.

396
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,046
And tell me what you see.

397
00:27:14,088 --> 00:27:15,088
Um...

398
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:56,630
I see everyone,
in their neighbourhood.

399
00:27:58,296 --> 00:28:02,545
Creating together,
learning together...

400
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:06,963
perfecting body and mind...

401
00:28:08,963 --> 00:28:10,296
And they're celebrating.

402
00:28:11,588 --> 00:28:12,588
They're...

403
00:28:14,421 --> 00:28:15,796
They created shelter.

404
00:28:20,213 --> 00:28:21,671
Because of the rain.

405
00:28:22,588 --> 00:28:24,130
Just came right above me.

406
00:28:25,213 --> 00:28:27,463
It's a perfect school-city
for its people,

407
00:28:28,421 --> 00:28:30,170
able to grow along with them,

408
00:28:30,171 --> 00:28:32,712
just like great cities
have always done.

409
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,337
What about those standing in your way,

410
00:28:37,338 --> 00:28:38,880
who like it the way it is?

411
00:28:40,671 --> 00:28:41,713
Like your father?

412
00:29:12,755 --> 00:29:15,254
What, him? You're working for him?

413
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:18,129
My daughter, a traitor?

414
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,838
Daddy, please!

415
00:29:20,505 --> 00:29:22,295
You taught me to be true to myself.

416
00:29:23,713 --> 00:29:25,754
You can't keep living
in the Middle Ages.

417
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:27,170
That man is a megalomaniac!

418
00:29:27,171 --> 00:29:30,879
He lures young beautiful girls
like you with his bullshit genius.

419
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,129
He destroys innocence,
loveliness, and asks of them

420
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,837
what Pygmalion asked of marble!

421
00:29:35,838 --> 00:29:38,296
Daddy, he's not as evil as you think.

422
00:29:39,296 --> 00:29:41,463
But there's... there's something.

423
00:29:42,671 --> 00:29:44,337
Something almost magical.

424
00:29:44,338 --> 00:29:45,920
Hey, ladies!

425
00:29:45,921 --> 00:29:47,629
Hi.

426
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,379
- Hold up, sir.
- What?

427
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,337
You're going to stop
the Mayor's parade?

428
00:29:51,338 --> 00:29:53,171
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

429
00:29:53,796 --> 00:29:55,755
This man is the bane of my existence.

430
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,920
- I want him out of my life.
- Yes.

431
00:29:58,921 --> 00:30:00,921
He actually made sure
I was here on time.

432
00:30:01,838 --> 00:30:02,838
He dropped you off?

433
00:30:04,838 --> 00:30:08,629
Smile. Smile. Smile.

434
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:12,255
"Soviet satellite

435
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:15,795
<i>"...and its nuclear fuel</i>

- Hi!
- Hi.

438
00:30:20,796 --> 00:30:23,212
- "an earth-orbiting..."
- And you!

439

00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:31,504
- What's your name?
- How do you do?

443
00:30:31,505 --> 00:30:32,587
- Huey.
- Huey.

444
00:30:32,588 --> 00:30:34,087
- Great to meet you.
- Claudine. Claudette.

445

Yeah,

00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:42,920
"emergency management discerned."

450
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:45,379
Which way did Huey go?

451
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,545
That way.

452
00:30:46,546 --> 00:30:48,546
Well, let's all go this way, then.

453
00:31:13,088 --> 00:31:14,088
<i>Cesar...</i>

454
00:31:27,463 --> 00:31:28,963
<i>Cesar, my darling.</i>

455
00:31:41,963 --> 00:31:43,130
<i>May 12th.</i>

456
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:46,337
<i>Reviewing District Attorney
Cicero's files</i>

457
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:48,338
<i>regarding Catilina murder case.</i>

458
00:32:32,255 --> 00:32:34,379
Any place in particular, Chief?

459
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,170
Uptown, downtown, heaven, or hell?

460
00:32:38,171 --> 00:32:39,629
Purgatory.

461
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,880
Copy that.

462
00:32:41,588 --> 00:32:42,755
You like ruins...

463
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,795
You like going to Atlantic City?
We got time.

464
00:32:46,796 --> 00:32:48,671
Well, we've always got time,

465
00:32:50,546 --> 00:32:52,670
even if I don't understand it.

466
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:55,171
Time's a funny thing to understand.

467
00:32:55,838 --> 00:32:57,005
Passing the time,

468
00:32:58,046 --> 00:32:59,962
finding time, losing time.

469
00:32:59,963 --> 00:33:01,670
Time that flies.

470
00:33:04,713 --> 00:33:08,212
I don't get it.
How is spying being ethical?

471
00:33:08,213 --> 00:33:11,046
It's not spying, it's research.

472
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:18,380
His wife's body completely vanished.
How? Why?

473
00:33:20,088 --> 00:33:21,130
To where?

474
00:33:31,755 --> 00:33:32,755
Julia.

475
00:33:34,963 --> 00:33:36,546
I love you, Julia.

476
00:33:40,213 --> 00:33:43,587
You can't cheat time
and you can't beat time.

477
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:48,046
You can't touch it,
taste it, see it, smell it.

478
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,670
Time stops for nobody.

479
00:33:51,671 --> 00:33:55,130
And I mean nobody.

480
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:24,088
Cesar.

481
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,255
You piece of shit.

482
00:34:35,755 --> 00:34:37,463
Pull, pull, pull, pull,
pull, pull around!

483
00:34:50,796 --> 00:34:52,463
Hey, honey.

484
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:14,796
Surrounded by injustice...

485
00:35:16,588 --> 00:35:18,254
so much suffering.

486
00:35:48,755 --> 00:35:50,046
Stop, stop.

487
00:35:54,505 --> 00:35:56,254
This doesn't make sense.

488
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:07,255
Cesar buys flowers.

489
00:36:08,171 --> 00:36:09,255
But for who?

490
00:36:24,671 --> 00:36:26,338
Okay, stop, stop.

491
00:36:36,213 --> 00:36:38,088
My heart breaks for you, Chief.

492
00:36:46,046 --> 00:36:47,463
Evening, Mr Catilina.

493
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:50,588
All right, wait for me, okay?

494
00:38:08,671 --> 00:38:10,338
He still loves her.

495
00:38:12,005 --> 00:38:13,338
He still loves...

496
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,630
We should go.

497
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:42,712
Such are the mysteries
of the human heart,

498
00:38:42,713 --> 00:38:45,546
making it difficult
for this historian...

499
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,255
to understand.

500
00:39:47,505 --> 00:39:49,921
- What goes there?
- A small stadium.

501
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,338
With a roof like gold tissue.

502
00:40:06,713 --> 00:40:07,921
Tell me,

503
00:40:08,546 --> 00:40:11,588
of all the institutions
your utopia will preserve,

504
00:40:14,046 --> 00:40:15,755
which is the most important to you?

505
00:40:18,421 --> 00:40:19,462
Marriage.

506
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,754
<i>The wind blows

507
00:40:25,755 --> 00:40:29,462

508
00:40:29,463 --> 00:40:31,213

"and others claim infantry

"is the supreme sight

"it is the one you love."

514
00:40:55,505 --> 00:40:57,379
They're so happy to see you.

515
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,921
<i>Where stands the Colosseum,
so stands Rome.</i>

516
00:41:23,921 --> 00:41:27,463
<i>When the Colosseum falls,
then Rome falls too.</i>

517
00:41:28,213 --> 00:41:32,213
<i>And when Rome falls,
the world falls with it.</i>

518
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,962
- Yes.
- My wedding gift to you.

519
00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:37,962
Wow!

520
00:41:39,255 --> 00:41:40,962
This is it?

521
00:41:40,963 --> 00:41:44,587
God damn it, Jerry!

522
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:46,963
"Greed is but a word...

523
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:51,254
"jealous men inflict

524
00:41:51,255 --> 00:41:54,129
Now you have
everything you always wanted.

525
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,421
Wow!

534
00:42:23,338 --> 00:42:24,505
Thank you, Jake.

00:42:37,546 --> 00:42:38,587
Cesar!

537
00:42:38,588 --> 00:42:39,920
Right here!

538
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:41,087
Okay.

539
00:42:41,088 --> 00:42:42,462
Julia!

540
00:42:42,463 --> 00:42:44,171
Hold on, hold this.

541
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,171
There's more here.

542
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,920
- You see this?
- Cesar!

543
00:42:49,921 --> 00:42:52,629
We understand Megalon is not safe,
do you have any comment on that?

544
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,754
No, it is not safe,
it is incredibly dangerous.

545
00:42:54,755 --> 00:42:56,712
What's your plan
for Megalopolis?

546
00:42:56,713 --> 00:42:58,420
We all should run! No, it's very safe.

547
00:42:58,421 --> 00:43:00,837
Best question anyone's ever asked.
What kind of pizza places?

548
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:02,670
Just a couple questions.
Just a quick statement.

549
00:43:02,671 --> 00:43:05,670
How do you feel about your
father bankrupting the city, Julia?

550
00:43:05,671 --> 00:43:07,295
I am not here representing the Mayor.

551
00:43:07,296 --> 00:43:09,212
Cesar, do you plan
on staying out all night partying?

552
00:43:09,213 --> 00:43:11,004
- Always. Always.
- Thank you for your question.

553
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,420
Julia,
do you still prefer girls?

554
00:43:12,421 --> 00:43:14,212
- Questions?
- Do you want to dispel any rumours

555
00:43:14,213 --> 00:43:16,045
- about your lifestyle?
- Who doesn't prefer girls?

556
00:43:16,046 --> 00:43:18,045
Who doesn't prefer girls?
Everyone prefers girls.

557
00:43:18,046 --> 00:43:20,879
Thank you for your questions,
have a great night.

558
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
Okay, we just head this way.

559
00:43:24,046 --> 00:43:26,087
There's one more here,
you need to talk about the dress.

560
00:43:26,088 --> 00:43:27,420
Tell us more about Megalon.

561
00:43:27,421 --> 00:43:28,713
Hired help.

562
00:43:35,255 --> 00:43:37,170
- Vesta, over here!
- Hi!

563
00:43:37,171 --> 00:43:39,795
I can never get used to this. Hi!

564
00:43:39,796 --> 00:43:41,004
Vesta!

565
00:43:41,005 --> 00:43:42,712
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen,

566
00:43:42,713 --> 00:43:44,337
ladies and gentlemen,
Vesta Sweetwater.

567
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:47,462
Is it true, Vesta,
is your dress made of Megalon?

568
00:43:47,463 --> 00:43:49,087
Yes, the first one ever.

569
00:43:49,088 --> 00:43:52,337
Designed by Cesar Catilina
just for little ol' me!

570
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,295
- Vesta, over here!
- Vesta!

571
00:43:54,296 --> 00:43:57,420
Looking absolutely gorgeous tonight!

572
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:02,129
Millions of tiny cell cameras transmit
what they see

573
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:03,630
through to the other side.

574
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:07,337
I'm invisible!

575
00:44:23,463 --> 00:44:27,670
Hello, would you like to buy
a military college cadet uniform?

576
00:44:27,671 --> 00:44:30,379
Patches, golden buttons, everything...

577
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,920
What a disgrace.

578
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:34,087
He used to be an Academy cadet,

579
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,170
now he's selling the fucking thing.

580
00:44:37,963 --> 00:44:43,296
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
and children of all ages.</i>

581
00:44:44,171 --> 00:44:47,879
<i>Welcome to this wonderful gathering</i>

582
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,629
<i>in celebration of the marriage</i>

583
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:55,921
<i>of our brother Crassus
and his Wow of a bride.</i>

584
00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:01,880
<i>Crassus Bank is saving our city
from debt.</i>

585
00:45:05,796 --> 00:45:07,796
Did you get
a prenuptial agreement?

586
00:45:08,755 --> 00:45:10,462
It's you.

587
00:45:10,463 --> 00:45:12,129
What are you up to with this...

588
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:13,546
Fraternity prank.

589
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:15,754
Did you get a prenup?

590
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:18,587
Well, I may be old
but I'm not stupid, you know.

591
00:45:18,588 --> 00:45:20,796
Well, then
why are you marrying her?

592
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:23,338
She's my gift to myself.

593
00:45:24,463 --> 00:45:27,587
She cures my headaches,
and she keeps me young.

594
00:45:27,588 --> 00:45:30,630
I might even live forever.

595
00:45:31,463 --> 00:45:32,545
Excuse me.

596
00:45:32,546 --> 00:45:34,088
Whoop-de-do for the heir!

597
00:45:35,755 --> 00:45:37,587
There he is!

598
00:45:37,588 --> 00:45:40,837
- Hello, genius cousin.
- My congratulations, Uncle,

599
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:42,962
- you've chosen well.
- Well, you would know.

600
00:45:42,963 --> 00:45:45,545
I'd like to propose a toast.

601
00:45:45,546 --> 00:45:49,254
To Wow Platinum
and my dear Uncle Hamilton.

602
00:45:49,255 --> 00:45:51,504
Together they represent the big three:

603
00:45:51,505 --> 00:45:54,504
economics, journalism...

604
00:45:54,505 --> 00:45:56,504
And sex appeal.

605
00:45:56,505 --> 00:45:59,420
- That's a good one, I like it.
- To the future of our family.

606
00:45:59,421 --> 00:46:01,212
To the future of our family!

607
00:46:01,213 --> 00:46:03,587
Future of our family.
Future...

608
00:46:03,588 --> 00:46:07,087
They say the only thing bigger
than Hamilton Crassus's bank account

609
00:46:07,088 --> 00:46:08,295
is his prick.

610
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,671
Good evening, Mother.

611
00:46:15,546 --> 00:46:16,795
Don't drink too much.

612
00:46:16,796 --> 00:46:19,337
I think maybe alligators
have the right idea.

613
00:46:19,338 --> 00:46:20,545
What's that?

614
00:46:20,546 --> 00:46:21,670
They eat their young.

615
00:46:21,671 --> 00:46:24,212
- It's what I'm gonna do.
- Crassie.

616
00:46:24,213 --> 00:46:27,004
- This is my wedding.
- It's your wedding.

617
00:46:27,005 --> 00:46:28,379
- That's why...
- My wedding...

618
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,754
- It's your wedding too.
- It's our...

619
00:46:29,755 --> 00:46:31,796
How did you get the name Wow Platinum?

620
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,171
Is it Greek?

621
00:46:35,755 --> 00:46:39,004
I picked it up at Penn Station
on my way to an employment agency.

622
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,338
- Holy... See, that's a lie.
- Wow!

623
00:46:43,005 --> 00:46:46,629
She told me
it was from a Cracker Jack box.

624
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:49,420
Jesus, you can't trust what she says.

625
00:46:49,421 --> 00:46:51,754
<i>And let's give
a round of applause</i>

626
00:46:51,755 --> 00:46:54,462
<i>for our reigning champion,</i>

627
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:58,046
<i>Gaius Metalus!</i>

628
00:47:01,171 --> 00:47:03,213
Hyah! Hyah!

629
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:19,213
These are his.

630
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:24,255
Byfavo remimazolam. Yummy!

631
00:47:28,505 --> 00:47:29,629
Reporting for duty.

632
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:32,170
Listen, you're an aide-de-camp,
not a minder.

633
00:47:32,171 --> 00:47:36,004
But once I cut loose,
don't worry, you're off the clock.

634
00:47:36,005 --> 00:47:37,545
You're absolved. Have a punch.

635
00:47:37,546 --> 00:47:39,587
Why do you pretend you're so bad?

636
00:47:41,296 --> 00:47:44,921
Well, if you pretend to be good,
the world won't take you seriously.

637
00:47:45,713 --> 00:47:47,296
But if you pretend to be bad...

638
00:47:50,046 --> 00:47:51,296
they kill you.

639
00:47:59,505 --> 00:48:01,213
Are the wrestlers coming?

640
00:48:03,921 --> 00:48:08,088
There's Gargantua!
Gargantua's here!

641
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,129
Hi, I'm Leah Arpelles,
from my school's newspaper,

642
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,629
it's called the <i>Dingbat News.</i>

643
00:48:18,213 --> 00:48:21,088
Is it better to look good,
or is it better to smell good?

644
00:48:21,796 --> 00:48:22,837
I think both.

645
00:48:22,838 --> 00:48:24,005
Amazonia!

646
00:48:25,255 --> 00:48:26,754
Big-time hunks!

647
00:48:26,755 --> 00:48:28,755
Is Cesar Catilina sexy?

648
00:48:29,421 --> 00:48:31,587
That... is a big question.

649
00:48:31,588 --> 00:48:33,130
I'm so jealous.

650
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:37,045
We call them C-notes,
I've got my cell phone number on them.

651
00:48:37,046 --> 00:48:38,130
Okay, don't grab.

652
00:48:43,505 --> 00:48:45,629
When did you smoke your first joint?

653
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,588
Never.

654
00:48:48,421 --> 00:48:51,337
Your father hates Cesar.
Why work for him?

655
00:48:51,338 --> 00:48:53,004
Is he your boss,

656
00:48:53,005 --> 00:48:54,337
or is he your boyfriend?

657
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,212
<i>Thank you very much,
Your Majesty, Your Highness, King.</i>

658
00:49:03,213 --> 00:49:05,295
<i>Here we are in Sweden.</i>

659
00:49:05,296 --> 00:49:07,170
<i>Thank you very much for having me.</i>

660
00:49:07,171 --> 00:49:09,712
<i>From what I understand,
there's a buffet after this.</i>

661
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:12,670
<i>So, the faster I can say my speech,</i>

662
00:49:12,671 --> 00:49:14,295
<i>the faster we can all eat.</i>

663
00:49:14,296 --> 00:49:17,379
<i>What I like are those little hot dogs
wrapped in the pastry.</i>

664
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:18,462
<i>I think they're...</i>

665
00:49:18,463 --> 00:49:20,504
<i>I can't remember the name
of them right now...</i>

666
00:49:20,505 --> 00:49:22,170
<i>Pigs in a blanket,
that's what they're called.</i>

667
00:49:22,171 --> 00:49:25,504
<i>Really, the Nobel Prize should be
for the person who invented those.</i>

668
00:49:25,505 --> 00:49:27,420
Cesar! Cesar! Cesar!

669
00:49:27,421 --> 00:49:30,505
<i>Make no mistake,
this discovery will change the world.</i>

670
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,295
Nice jacket, Cesar.

671
00:49:33,296 --> 00:49:35,630
Is that Baratha from Savile Row?

672
00:49:37,296 --> 00:49:38,630
May I touch it?

673
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:45,254
10:17 pm. Drunk and stoned,

674
00:49:45,255 --> 00:49:47,588
Cesar doesn't know
who he is for a few hours.

675
00:49:49,046 --> 00:49:50,630
A moment of grace, perhaps?

676
00:49:56,588 --> 00:49:58,171
- Are they together?
- No.

677
00:50:00,463 --> 00:50:02,254
And with that womaniser?

678
00:50:02,255 --> 00:50:04,420
"Womaniser",
that's an awful word.

679
00:50:04,421 --> 00:50:07,213
As if the woman
had nothing to do with it.

680
00:50:14,963 --> 00:50:16,005
Look at that.

681
00:50:28,005 --> 00:50:31,505
<i>When you leap into the unknown,
you prove that you are free.</i>

682
00:50:32,421 --> 00:50:36,420
<i>When we leap into the unknown,
we prove we are free.</i>

683
00:50:39,421 --> 00:50:41,379
<i>We prove that we are free.</i>

684
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:45,629
<i>When we leap into the unknown,
we prove that we are free.</i>

685
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:49,045
<i>Follow me, I'll show you.</i>

686
00:50:53,546 --> 00:50:56,505
<i>But if it's our mind
that can invent gods,</i>

687
00:50:58,296 --> 00:51:00,296
<i>and if from them flows such power,</i>

688
00:51:02,255 --> 00:51:05,170
<i>why can't we apply
that power directly?</i>

689
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:40,212
<i>From this moment forward,
we perform without a net.</i>

690
00:51:40,213 --> 00:51:41,380
My God!

691
00:51:42,171 --> 00:51:43,212
Look at that!

692
00:51:43,213 --> 00:51:46,212
But if it's our mind
that can invent gods...

693
00:51:46,213 --> 00:51:47,962
<i>that can invent gods...</i>

694
00:51:47,963 --> 00:51:51,712
His pleasantness,
his beautiful skin,

695
00:51:51,713 --> 00:51:54,295
middle-aged women scream for him

696
00:51:54,296 --> 00:51:56,004
as girls scream for rock stars.

697
00:51:56,005 --> 00:51:58,295
But if it's our mind
that can invent gods,

698
00:51:58,296 --> 00:52:00,545
and if from them flows such power...

699
00:52:00,546 --> 00:52:01,962
<i>Cesar...</i>

700
00:52:01,963 --> 00:52:03,463
<i>prove that we are free.</i>

701
00:52:14,046 --> 00:52:15,755
You fooled me!

702
00:52:27,671 --> 00:52:30,921
When we leap into the unknown,
we prove we are free.

703
00:52:33,088 --> 00:52:36,337
<i>When we leap into the unknown,
we prove we are free.</i>

704
00:52:38,546 --> 00:52:41,295
<i>When we leap into the unknown,
we prove we are free.</i>

705
00:52:41,296 --> 00:52:44,045

706
00:52:44,046 --> 00:52:46,045

708
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:53,129
<i>But if it's our mind

709
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:56,255
<i>and if from them flows such power,</i>

710
00:52:57,046 --> 00:52:59,795
<i>why can't we apply
that power directly?</i>

711
00:52:59,796 --> 00:53:02,420
But if it's our mind
that can invent gods,

712
00:53:02,421 --> 00:53:05,630
<i>and if from them flows such power,</i>

713
00:53:06,296 --> 00:53:08,295
why can't we apply
that power directly?

714
00:53:08,296 --> 00:53:09,546
<i>Cesar.</i>

715
00:53:10,171 --> 00:53:12,755
<i>But if it's our mind
that can invent gods,</i>

716
00:53:13,713 --> 00:53:16,587
<i>and if from them flows such power...</i>

717
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,255
Mr Crassus?

718
00:53:38,046 --> 00:53:40,879
- Who's in charge?
- Right here, Mr Crassus.

719
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,171
Well, hello,

720
00:53:43,171 --> 00:53:44,962
Mr Boss Man.

721
00:53:44,963 --> 00:53:46,963
Play this for my grand finale.

722
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,837
Listen, do what he says.

723
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:52,880
- The bank is his.
- Absolutely free.

724
00:53:53,796 --> 00:53:56,213
So everyone can see!

725
00:53:58,213 --> 00:54:00,212
For your time, putz.

726
00:54:00,213 --> 00:54:03,921
Widen out, camera 3.
Camera 4, punch in.

727
00:54:07,296 --> 00:54:09,213
We did it!

728
00:54:11,046 --> 00:54:12,170
Whoo!

729
00:54:14,255 --> 00:54:17,129
Hey, get outta here, bozo!

730
00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:28,338
Enjoy the show.

731
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:39,337
<i>The vestal virgins
assured the success</i>

732
00:54:39,338 --> 00:54:41,545
<i>and sanctity of ancient Rome.</i>

733
00:54:41,546 --> 00:54:44,795
<i>Dedicated to Vesta,
goddess of the hearth,</i>

734
00:54:44,796 --> 00:54:47,295
<i>whom Ovid calls</i> "custos flammai",

735
00:54:47,296 --> 00:54:49,754
<i>or "keeper of the flame".</i>

736
00:54:49,755 --> 00:54:53,545
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

737
00:54:53,546 --> 00:54:57,545
<i>a vision of virginal veracity...</i>

738
00:54:57,546 --> 00:54:59,213
She took the "Pure Love Pledge".

739
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:07,046
<i>I present to you
our own virgin sweetheart,</i>

740
00:55:08,255 --> 00:55:11,545
<i>Vesta Sweetwater!</i>

741
00:55:13,505 --> 00:55:15,087
Okay, girls, come here.

742
00:55:15,088 --> 00:55:16,928
Grab that and go in front.
You go in the front.

743
00:55:19,421 --> 00:55:24,670
<i>I always thought
that it wasn't true</i>

744
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:30,045
<i>That in the darkness,
the light came through</i>

745
00:55:30,046 --> 00:55:34,838
<i>And then I found it, the missing key</i>

746
00:55:35,421 --> 00:55:40,712
<i>Right there inside me, God's purity</i>

747
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:45,837
<i>I'm reachin' out
See through the clouds</i>

748
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:50,170
<i>Stand with me now, and lose all doubt</i>

749
00:55:50,171 --> 00:55:52,420
<i>- I'm reachin' out
- 'Cause I'm here now</i>

750
00:55:52,421 --> 00:55:53,962
<i>See through the clouds</i>

751
00:55:53,963 --> 00:55:56,337
<i>- You have my vow
- Stand with me now</i>

752
00:55:56,338 --> 00:56:00,462
<i>- Serenity is fine with me</i>
- CLODIA: Foreplay...

753
00:56:00,463 --> 00:56:07,379
<i>I'll stand under the sun</i>

754
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:10,795
<i>Hear my song and hear my prayer</i>

755
00:56:10,796 --> 00:56:16,962
<i>I'll pledge my purity</i>

756
00:56:16,963 --> 00:56:19,920
<i>- It's my promise, it's my swear...
- I want each of you</i>

757
00:56:19,921 --> 00:56:24,505
<i>to look into your heart
and give generously</i>

758
00:56:25,463 --> 00:56:28,795
<i>to support her virgin pledge.</i>

759
00:56:31,338 --> 00:56:35,588
<i>Which of you will pledge
a hundred thousand?</i>

760
00:56:36,421 --> 00:56:37,920
One hundred thousand.

761
00:56:37,921 --> 00:56:40,005
<i>Two hundred thousand?</i>

762
00:56:41,671 --> 00:56:44,170
<i>'Cause I'm here now</i>

763
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:46,130
<i>You have my vow...</i>

764
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:49,546
<i>Five hundred thousand!</i>

765
00:56:50,671 --> 00:56:54,962
<i>I know you, I feel you,
I see you, I hear you...</i>

766
00:56:54,963 --> 00:57:00,087
<i>Remember,
her pledge to marry as a virgin,</i>

767
00:57:00,088 --> 00:57:03,295
<i>that is money to the city!</i>

768
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:06,837
<i>And your pledge, joined with hers,</i>

769
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:11,670
<i>is helping our city 10, 12, 20 fold!</i>

770
00:57:11,671 --> 00:57:14,545
<i>Been down the roads you've been down</i>

771
00:57:14,546 --> 00:57:17,588
<i>'Cause I am you I know...</i>

772
00:57:18,505 --> 00:57:19,880
<i>$1 million!</i>

773
00:57:21,713 --> 00:57:25,505
<i>Just reach into your pockets and give!</i>

774
00:57:26,546 --> 00:57:28,588
<i>We can make the difference!</i>

775
00:57:29,671 --> 00:57:31,754
That's it, that's it,
you see that?

776
00:57:31,755 --> 00:57:33,963
There's some big money up here!

777
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:42,337
<i>We can make
the numbers board go up, up, up!</i>

778
00:57:44,421 --> 00:57:46,129
<i>$10 million!</i>

779
00:57:50,171 --> 00:57:53,546
<i>We are going to do it!
We can do it!</i>

780
00:57:54,838 --> 00:57:57,338
<i>Do I hear $100 million?</i>

781
00:57:58,171 --> 00:58:00,463
<i>$100 million!</i>

782
00:58:01,588 --> 00:58:05,504
<i>Thank you, Nush Berman,
for your generous pledge!</i>

783
00:58:05,505 --> 00:58:10,213
<i>Under the sun, hear my song
And hear my prayer</i>

784
00:58:11,171 --> 00:58:16,545
<i>I'll pledge my purity</i>

785
00:58:16,546 --> 00:58:19,629
<i>It's my promise, it's my swear</i>

786
00:58:21,505 --> 00:58:23,171
You can see right through me!

787
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:28,879
That's good, stay with that.
Stay with that, camera 3.

788
00:58:51,338 --> 00:58:53,296
It's Cesar!

789
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:02,545
Liar, liar!

790
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:20,587
<i>Rather than just design the form</i>

791
00:59:20,588 --> 00:59:21,962
<i>or shape of an object,</i>

792
00:59:21,963 --> 00:59:24,004
<i>you can actually design
at the cellular level.</i>

793
00:59:24,005 --> 00:59:28,421
<i>You can actually design
at the cellular level.</i>

794
00:59:31,171 --> 00:59:33,380
Ladies and gentlemen, stay calm!

795
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:35,254
Ladies and gentlemen...

796
00:59:35,255 --> 00:59:36,755
Wait, ladies and...

797
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,505
Ladies and gentlemen!

798
00:59:40,171 --> 00:59:42,838
Hey! Can you bring me down?
Bring me down!

799
00:59:45,338 --> 00:59:48,420
Ladies and gentlemen!
Wait, ladies and gent...

800
00:59:48,421 --> 00:59:50,420
<i>Testing, testing. One, two, three.</i>

801
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:52,337
<i>Testing, testing.</i>

802
00:59:53,671 --> 00:59:56,754
<i>In heaven's name,</i>

803
00:59:56,755 --> 00:59:58,087
<i>Catilina,</i>

804
00:59:58,088 --> 01:00:01,296
<i>how long will you try our patience?</i>

805
01:00:03,671 --> 01:00:08,045
<i>How long will this madness
of yours mock us?</i>

806
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,254
<i>Hey, buddy,
don't look at your nose in the mirror</i>

807
01:00:13,255 --> 01:00:15,045
'cause it's not where it used to be.

808
01:00:17,463 --> 01:00:20,295
<i>To what depths of devastation</i>

809
01:00:20,296 --> 01:00:24,420
<i>will your unbridled audacity
hurl this city?</i>

810
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,337
<i>Your sordid life</i>

811
01:00:35,338 --> 01:00:38,963
<i>is marked
with every sort of scandalous blot,</i>

812
01:00:40,421 --> 01:00:41,421
<i>every dishonour</i>

813
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:44,462
<i>and wicked stain</i>

814
01:00:44,463 --> 01:00:47,046
<i>our human imagination can conceive.</i>

815
01:00:48,796 --> 01:00:51,671
<i>What times!</i>

816
01:00:52,255 --> 01:00:53,962
<i>Within this city...</i>

817
01:00:56,255 --> 01:01:01,338
<i>there is nothing that can
give you satisfaction any more.</i>

818
01:01:02,755 --> 01:01:07,421
<i>Apart from your own
degraded band of hangers-on,</i>

819
01:01:08,963 --> 01:01:10,712
<i>does not the alarm of the people</i>

820
01:01:10,713 --> 01:01:12,796
<i>have any effect upon you?</i>

821
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:18,045
<i>No man exists</i>

822
01:01:18,046 --> 01:01:21,630
<i>who does not hold you in detestation.</i>

823
01:01:22,921 --> 01:01:26,629
I hold you in detestation,
whatever the hell that man means.

824
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:29,838
<i>Resign in disgrace, Catilina.</i>

825
01:01:31,505 --> 01:01:35,796
<i>It is your only choice, step down now!</i>

826
01:01:40,255 --> 01:01:42,338
Huey, anyone can own this city.

827
01:01:43,463 --> 01:01:45,380
There's a big sign nailed to it,

828
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:47,630
"City for Sale".

829
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,295
<i>Catilina stumbles
into the night, broken and dazed,</i>

830
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:37,630
<i>but there is no softness
in his degeneration.</i>

831
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:42,587
This breakout
was long overdue, Miss Julia.

832
01:02:42,588 --> 01:02:44,380
Lord.

833
01:02:45,713 --> 01:02:46,880
Wait, what's happening?

834
01:02:50,046 --> 01:02:52,545
- Hands where I can see them!
- Hands where you can see them.

835
01:02:52,546 --> 01:02:53,962
Cesar Catilina, open the door.

836
01:02:53,963 --> 01:02:55,212
He's asleep.

837
01:02:55,213 --> 01:02:56,379
Hey, Cesar.

838
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,129
I don't care if he's asleep,
get him up!

839
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:00,254
- He's sleeping!
- Get him up right now.

840
01:03:00,255 --> 01:03:02,670
He's sleeping! Excuse... Hey! Hey!

841
01:03:02,671 --> 01:03:04,087
- Hey, no!
- Let go!

842
01:03:04,088 --> 01:03:05,879
- This is not...
- Stop resisting!

843
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,129
- Stop it!
- Commissioner.

844
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:09,545
- Fundi, take it easy. Take it easy.
- What's going on?

845
01:03:09,546 --> 01:03:12,087
- Mr Catilina is under arrest.
- What are the charges?

846
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:15,420
Unlawful intercourse with a minor,
statutory rape, and more coming.

847
01:03:15,421 --> 01:03:18,462
- What are you talking about?
- No. No. No. It was a setup, okay?

848
01:03:18,463 --> 01:03:20,379
- Get your hands off him!
- Give me your hand!

849
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:21,670
- Fuck you!
- Julia. Julia,

850
01:03:21,671 --> 01:03:22,837
please get back in the car.

851
01:03:22,838 --> 01:03:24,170
- No, he's not... No.
- Julia.

852
01:03:24,171 --> 01:03:25,254
Okay, no.

853
01:03:25,255 --> 01:03:27,045
- This is not right.
- Please, Julia.

854
01:03:27,046 --> 01:03:28,879
- Wait! It's not...
- Julia!

855
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,254
Fuck you!

856
01:03:30,255 --> 01:03:32,587
- This is not right!
- Julia, don't make it any worse.

857
01:03:32,588 --> 01:03:34,045
This is wrong. No!

858
01:03:34,046 --> 01:03:36,795
- Would you get back in the car?
- You're wrong.

859
01:03:38,671 --> 01:03:40,670
Until he can
understand his rights,

860
01:03:40,671 --> 01:03:42,421
we'll call it "protective custody".

861
01:03:49,213 --> 01:03:51,713
Come on, Miss Julia,
let's get you home.

862
01:04:11,213 --> 01:04:14,921
Revenge tastes best
while wearing a dress.

863
01:04:32,838 --> 01:04:33,838
Time,

864
01:04:35,046 --> 01:04:36,046
stop.

865
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:45,295
Vesta,
not a single thing on her.

866
01:04:45,296 --> 01:04:46,420
Yeah.

867
01:04:46,421 --> 01:04:47,755
I don't trust her.

868
01:04:49,213 --> 01:04:51,129
Wait, what's this over here?

869
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:52,379
- Got it?
- Yeah...

870
01:04:53,921 --> 01:04:55,545
Here it is.

871
01:04:55,546 --> 01:04:56,796
Bingo. Vesta.

872
01:04:57,546 --> 01:04:59,255
My God.

873
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:03,170
- Got it.
- She wasn't even born here.

874
01:05:05,421 --> 01:05:07,795
She was born in Indonesia.

875
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,505
She came here when she was six.

876
01:05:11,713 --> 01:05:13,587
Lying little slut.

877
01:05:13,588 --> 01:05:15,254
Good job. Nailed it.

878
01:05:15,255 --> 01:05:17,587
Okay, let's go.
Quick, quick, quick.

879
01:05:39,296 --> 01:05:40,671
<i>You can sit down.</i>

880
01:05:46,713 --> 01:05:51,213
It makes me very happy
that you came to me ahead of Cesar.

881
01:05:52,255 --> 01:05:54,546
A father matters, yes?

882
01:05:55,463 --> 01:05:57,255
Always father.

883
01:05:58,213 --> 01:06:00,130
Always your faithful daughter.

884
01:06:04,796 --> 01:06:07,005
Exactly
who else knows about this?

885
01:06:08,671 --> 01:06:11,337
Come on, Daddy. She's 23 years old.

886
01:06:11,338 --> 01:06:13,462
Clodio faked that video.

887
01:06:13,463 --> 01:06:16,670
Catilina is
the guiltiest man unhanged.

888
01:06:16,671 --> 01:06:19,504
But that's Vesta's birth certificate.

889
01:06:19,505 --> 01:06:20,795
It exonerates him.

890
01:06:20,796 --> 01:06:22,088
Legally, yes.

891
01:06:23,921 --> 01:06:25,005
But not morally.

892
01:06:27,755 --> 01:06:29,088
I can get another one.

893
01:06:31,338 --> 01:06:32,962
Don't.

894
01:06:32,963 --> 01:06:34,170
Julia.

895
01:06:34,171 --> 01:06:36,170
I'm going to Hamilton Crassus.

896
01:06:36,171 --> 01:06:37,337
Julia?

897
01:06:39,505 --> 01:06:41,712
<i>All the money in Rome</i>

898
01:06:41,713 --> 01:06:44,255
<i>couldn't get me to change my mind.</i>

899
01:06:53,338 --> 01:06:54,962
- Julia.
- Hi.

900
01:06:54,963 --> 01:06:56,295
Come in, come in, come in.

901
01:06:56,296 --> 01:06:58,795
I had hoped to speak
with Mr Crassus.

902
01:07:00,171 --> 01:07:01,546
I love that sound.

903
01:07:09,963 --> 01:07:11,713
Listen, bitch.

904
01:07:12,755 --> 01:07:15,004
You and I ought to have
an understanding.

905
01:07:15,005 --> 01:07:16,795
You're on my territory now,

906
01:07:16,796 --> 01:07:18,671
and you're going to play by my rules!

907
01:07:19,255 --> 01:07:20,338
Okay?

908
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:24,087
One, Crassus is mine.

909
01:07:25,255 --> 01:07:28,587
Two, the bank is mine.

910
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:34,170
And three, and this may come
as a little surprise to you...

911
01:07:34,171 --> 01:07:35,255
Right.

912
01:07:36,255 --> 01:07:37,421
Cesar's mine.

913
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:41,338
And he has been, for a long time.

914
01:07:43,338 --> 01:07:45,254
Romans ruled the world,

915
01:07:45,255 --> 01:07:47,338
but their wives ruled at home.

916
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:50,379
I'll be Robin Hood for Saturnalia.

917
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:53,963
Tra la la! Beautiful.

918
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:56,630
It's all great, and the shoes?

919
01:07:58,505 --> 01:07:59,921
I can't trust you.

920
01:08:00,463 --> 01:08:01,962
Why not?

921
01:08:01,963 --> 01:08:04,587
You've been attacking your cousin
since you were six years old,

922
01:08:04,588 --> 01:08:07,295
and I only hope you had
nothing to do with that shit.

923
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:08,421
Of course not. How...

924
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:11,921
How could you say that?

925
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:16,629
So what happens now?

926
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:18,005
Am I off the list?

927
01:08:18,588 --> 01:08:19,755
What list?

928
01:08:20,546 --> 01:08:21,796
Your list of heirs.

929
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:25,796
You're going to have
to prove yourself to me, son.

930
01:08:28,421 --> 01:08:30,379
And cut your hair!

931
01:08:33,421 --> 01:08:36,337
<i>Teen singing sensation
Vesta Sweetwater,</i>

932
01:08:36,338 --> 01:08:39,337
<i>who had marketed herself
as being a 16-year-old,</i>

933
01:08:39,338 --> 01:08:42,212
<i>and the city's "Virgin Sweetheart",</i>

934
01:08:42,213 --> 01:08:43,920
<i>is actually 23 years old,</i>

935
01:08:43,921 --> 01:08:46,796
<i>the New Rome district attorney
announced today.</i>

936
01:08:49,255 --> 01:08:52,379
<i>Forensic examination
of the photos of sexual acts</i>

937
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:55,754
<i>revealed that they were doctored
and not authentic.</i>

938
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:05,129
<i>There goes the dream
that you had for me</i>

939
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:07,170
<i>I guess I'm burning it down</i>

940
01:09:07,171 --> 01:09:09,004
<i>It's all fucked</i>

941
01:09:09,005 --> 01:09:12,630
<i>And there's no turning around</i>

942
01:09:37,463 --> 01:09:38,505
Hello!

943
01:09:39,255 --> 01:09:40,505
How do you feel today?

944
01:09:41,005 --> 01:09:43,088
What great new ideas do you have?

945
01:09:44,088 --> 01:09:46,088
I bet there's at least 50 of them!

946
01:09:51,213 --> 01:09:55,713
Addiction, Disgrace, Scandal,

947
01:09:57,671 --> 01:09:58,671
and Murder.

948
01:09:59,463 --> 01:10:01,255
The charges against you were dropped!

949
01:10:02,671 --> 01:10:04,005
I've lost my power.

950
01:10:12,046 --> 01:10:14,462
I can't control time any more.

951
01:10:14,463 --> 01:10:17,796
Artists can never lose
their control of time.

952
01:10:19,088 --> 01:10:21,379
You taught me that,

953
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:24,087
how painters stop time,

954
01:10:24,088 --> 01:10:27,962
how architecture is frozen music,

955
01:10:27,963 --> 01:10:31,130
how dancers combine time and space,

956
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:36,295
musicians rhythmatise it,
poets sing it.

957
01:10:36,296 --> 01:10:37,880
I didn't murder my wife...

958
01:10:40,213 --> 01:10:41,338
but my moods...

959
01:10:45,546 --> 01:10:46,546
my mania...

960
01:10:51,463 --> 01:10:52,963
they drove her to...

961
01:10:55,588 --> 01:10:57,505
I'm sure she was proud
to be your wife.

962
01:11:12,588 --> 01:11:15,005
Now, time,

963
01:11:18,046 --> 01:11:19,046
stop!

964
01:11:24,255 --> 01:11:25,255
Do it for me.

965
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:30,380
Try.

966
01:11:36,463 --> 01:11:38,296
Stop time, for me.

967
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:42,630
Try it.

968
01:12:03,421 --> 01:12:04,880
Hear me, time.

969
01:12:08,338 --> 01:12:09,421
For Julia...

970
01:12:09,963 --> 01:12:11,005
Just try.

971
01:12:13,255 --> 01:12:15,088
Hear me, time, stop now.

972
01:12:26,088 --> 01:12:27,463
We seem to have done it.

973
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:32,963
Dream?

974
01:13:34,171 --> 01:13:35,838
The omens are bad, my love.

975
01:13:37,588 --> 01:13:39,588
I was looking at the full moon,

976
01:13:40,838 --> 01:13:45,588
when a cloud
that looked like a hand grabbed it.

977
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:55,005
Only those in a nightmare
are capable of praising the moonlight.

978
01:14:05,213 --> 01:14:07,421
Poor Chippy
broke his leg in the door.

979
01:14:08,005 --> 01:14:10,295
First Megalon splint, by Julia!

980
01:14:10,296 --> 01:14:12,045
Chippy! Aw, what happened?

981
01:14:12,046 --> 01:14:15,795
Her leg tissue will be fused
with the Megalon in just a few weeks.

982
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:22,629
Make an interesting shape,
but try not to break the structure.

983
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:23,712
Within five minutes,

984
01:14:23,713 --> 01:14:26,295
we should be able to get to
a hospital, to a theatre.

985
01:14:26,296 --> 01:14:27,379
All within five minutes.

986
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:30,379
This is what I'm talking about,
we need to be interconnected.

987
01:14:31,921 --> 01:14:34,004
Let's take things from nature.

988
01:14:34,005 --> 01:14:35,920
These are legs, faces, heads...

989
01:14:35,921 --> 01:14:38,587
The fastest way is through
a straight line to a point.

990
01:14:41,088 --> 01:14:42,088
Okay, next.

991
01:14:42,671 --> 01:14:45,212
Look at that model again
and explain it to me one more time.

992
01:14:45,213 --> 01:14:46,380
What's this?

993
01:14:48,963 --> 01:14:51,004
Look just below the top.
That's gotta go.

994
01:14:51,005 --> 01:14:52,795
Try to maintain the shape.

995
01:15:07,296 --> 01:15:08,545
I remember,

996
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:12,837
they rushed me to the hospital
because I had a terrible stomachache.

997
01:15:12,838 --> 01:15:16,630
Instead... what I had was you.

998
01:15:19,046 --> 01:15:21,129
A genius son.

999
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:23,254
Mom, this is... this is Julia.

1000
01:15:27,713 --> 01:15:29,463
I wish I could have had a girl.

1001
01:15:30,463 --> 01:15:33,045
We could have gone shopping,
we could have had lunch...

1002
01:15:33,046 --> 01:15:34,879
Mom, Julia's a girl.

1003
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:39,337
Instead, you were my great surprise...

1004
01:15:39,338 --> 01:15:45,129
And you go on and on and on and on
surprising everyone.

1005
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:47,213
I don't...

1006
01:15:47,963 --> 01:15:50,962
Despite what you think, I'm not crazy.

1007
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,130
My voices say I'm sane.

1008
01:15:55,255 --> 01:15:56,546
Well.

1009
01:15:57,588 --> 01:15:59,755
Without that girl's love,

1010
01:16:01,046 --> 01:16:04,421
you're going to be
a has-been and a fake,

1011
01:16:06,505 --> 01:16:07,671
like your father.

1012
01:16:11,171 --> 01:16:13,254
Do you know
that there is string theory?

1013
01:16:13,255 --> 01:16:17,879
Do you know what that means?
That there are 11, 11 dimensions.

1014
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:20,504
It hasn't been proven yet,
but that's what they think.

1015
01:16:20,505 --> 01:16:22,337
It's all just strings, you know...

1016
01:16:23,796 --> 01:16:25,545
that interesting?

1017
01:16:25,546 --> 01:16:27,295
You know,
when you got that Nobel Prize,

1018
01:16:27,296 --> 01:16:28,879
why didn't you mention my name?

1019
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,420
You could have gotten up,

1020
01:16:30,421 --> 01:16:33,670
and you could have said,
"To my mother".

1021
01:16:33,671 --> 01:16:36,005
- I was very sick.
- You could have said...

1022
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:38,130
I forgot.

1023
01:16:38,921 --> 01:16:39,921
I'm sorry.

1024
01:16:40,671 --> 01:16:41,920
I don't think so.

1025
01:16:41,921 --> 01:16:44,005
They don't know I'm your mother.

1026
01:16:44,921 --> 01:16:46,130
When you're with her...

1027
01:16:47,796 --> 01:16:50,004
you're finally able to forget me.

1028
01:16:50,005 --> 01:16:51,588
- No, no.
- No?

1029
01:16:53,088 --> 01:16:54,088
No.

1030
01:16:59,338 --> 01:17:00,630
That hurt.

1031
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:03,505
He hurt me.

1032
01:17:04,671 --> 01:17:05,713
You hurt me.

1033
01:17:06,505 --> 01:17:08,629
I was kissing you, Mother.

1034
01:17:22,713 --> 01:17:27,713
<i>What a diff'rence a day made</i>

1035
01:17:31,171 --> 01:17:36,338
<i>Twenty-four little hours</i>

1036
01:17:38,838 --> 01:17:42,838
<i>Brought the sun and the flowers</i>

1037
01:17:46,796 --> 01:17:49,880
<i>Where there used to be rain</i>

1038
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,296
That's it. Faster.

1039
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:00,379
No, you were doing it.

1040
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:02,462
- You were doing it.
- I'm just doing a solo.

1041
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:10,754
You've taken my life and turned it
into something really beautiful,

1042
01:18:10,755 --> 01:18:13,962
and I can't create anything
without you next to me.

1043
01:18:13,963 --> 01:18:15,837
No, I mean it.

1044
01:18:15,838 --> 01:18:18,837
You're the driving force
behind everything.

1045
01:18:18,838 --> 01:18:23,629
My inspiration comes from you,
my clarity comes from you,

1046
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:25,338
my patience comes from you.

1047
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:29,837
If I can imitate just 10%
of how you are in the world,

1048
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:31,546
it would be a success.

1049
01:18:33,338 --> 01:18:35,295
I've never loved anybody like you.

1050
01:18:35,296 --> 01:18:37,338
Love you. I love you. I love you.

1051
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:41,379
<i>Go to hell, Cesar!</i>

1052
01:18:51,213 --> 01:18:52,629
Excuse me.

1053
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:54,129
What is this about?

1054
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:56,337
Catilina levelled
their fucking neighbourhood

1055
01:18:56,338 --> 01:18:57,712
for his stupid Megalopolis.

1056
01:18:57,713 --> 01:18:59,087
He's an unelected monster!

1057
01:18:59,088 --> 01:19:01,379
He tore down our house,
ripped off the roof,

1058
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:03,129
now we got no food, we got nothing!

1059
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:05,212
- Fucking disgusting.
- Give them some money.

1060
01:19:05,213 --> 01:19:08,170
- Here. Here, take it.
- Hey, you guys okay?

1061
01:19:08,171 --> 01:19:10,004
Just look at them... I'm not sure...

1062
01:19:10,005 --> 01:19:11,337
See, this...

1063
01:19:11,338 --> 01:19:13,337
this is power,
this is where you find it.

1064
01:19:13,338 --> 01:19:15,920
You want power, you go public,
that's where the real power is.

1065
01:19:15,921 --> 01:19:18,295
Then you'd be giving the city
to a bunch of mongrels.

1066
01:19:18,296 --> 01:19:20,879
- I mean, look at them, look at them.
- Not mongrels, immigrants.

1067
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,712
They're citizens these people,
they believe in voting, understand?

1068
01:19:23,713 --> 01:19:25,379
They hate Cesar, okay?

1069
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:28,170
This is my chance to tear down
this bullshit Megalopolis.

1070
01:19:28,171 --> 01:19:31,004
I'm a citizen, you're a citizen.
These people are just human garbage.

1071
01:19:31,005 --> 01:19:33,670
Okay, okay, give me my money,
and get me to the front of them,

1072
01:19:33,671 --> 01:19:35,212
that's what you're doing. Yes?

1073
01:19:35,213 --> 01:19:37,337
Make way for Clodio!

1074
01:19:37,338 --> 01:19:42,837
All hail, Clodio!
Hail, Clodio! Make way!

1075
01:19:42,838 --> 01:19:44,754
Power to the people.

1076
01:19:44,755 --> 01:19:45,921
Yeah?

1077
01:19:46,963 --> 01:19:48,212
Get that for me. Buy that.

1078
01:19:48,213 --> 01:19:50,837
- Hey, here, give him the mic.
- I'll give it back to you.

1079
01:19:50,838 --> 01:19:52,213
Power to the people.

1080
01:19:53,213 --> 01:19:54,254
<i>I care.</i>

1081
01:19:54,255 --> 01:19:56,170
<i>Hand this out. Hand this out.</i>

1082
01:19:56,171 --> 01:19:58,545
<i>- I care. I see you.</i>
- Fuck Catilina.

1083
01:19:58,546 --> 01:20:00,462
- Where the hell is Cesar?
<i>- I see you.</i>

1084
01:20:00,463 --> 01:20:02,629
- Power to the people!
<i>- Power to the people!</i>

1085
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:04,837
- Power to the people!
<i>- I care.</i>

1086
01:20:04,838 --> 01:20:06,879
- Power to the people!
<i>- I care about you</i>

1087
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,254
<i>and I'm here and I see you!</i>

1088
01:20:08,255 --> 01:20:10,545
<i>- Hands off our homes!</i>
- Hands off our homes!

1089
01:20:10,546 --> 01:20:12,880
<i>- Hands off our homes!</i>
- Hands off our homes!

1090
01:20:17,296 --> 01:20:18,962
- Sorry.
- What is it?

1091
01:20:18,963 --> 01:20:21,920
Mr Nush Berman is here,
he'd like a minute of your time.

1092
01:20:21,921 --> 01:20:23,587
I'll... I...

1093
01:20:23,588 --> 01:20:26,337
Not in the residence.
I'll see him in the banquet hall.

1094
01:20:26,338 --> 01:20:28,630
Excuse me just one moment,
I'll return soon.

1095
01:20:29,296 --> 01:20:30,713
Come back soon, Frankie.

1096
01:20:31,546 --> 01:20:33,587
So we're going to go slow,

1097
01:20:33,588 --> 01:20:37,670
quick quick slow, quick quick slow...

1098
01:20:39,046 --> 01:20:41,712
Slow, quick quick slow...

1099
01:20:41,713 --> 01:20:43,254
I'm aware that this kid Clodio

1100
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:46,545
is a close friend of your,
your daughter Julia?

1101
01:20:46,546 --> 01:20:49,045
He's no friend of Julia's,
he's an acquaintance,

1102
01:20:49,046 --> 01:20:50,795
and a bad influence.

1103
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,545
He faked that video
of Catilina somehow.

1104
01:20:54,546 --> 01:20:57,837
He's picking up
a large popular constituency.

1105
01:20:57,838 --> 01:21:00,338
He's some kind of genius,
he can talk everything.

1106
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,421
You handle this, Nush.

1107
01:21:05,171 --> 01:21:06,713
Okay. I'll fix it.

1108
01:21:07,671 --> 01:21:09,546
Just wanted to check with you first

1109
01:21:10,838 --> 01:21:12,130
because, you know...

1110
01:21:13,088 --> 01:21:14,171
Julia?

1111
01:21:17,588 --> 01:21:19,295
I don't mind the lightning,

1112
01:21:19,296 --> 01:21:21,671
but the thunder scares
the shit out of me.

1113
01:21:35,588 --> 01:21:36,837
- And...
- Your Honour,

1114
01:21:36,838 --> 01:21:38,795
- you're never going to believe this.
- What?

1115
01:21:38,796 --> 01:21:41,129
You know that satellite
that's coming down over Labrador?

1116
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:42,212
- Yes?
- Well,

1117
01:21:42,213 --> 01:21:43,837
it's not coming down over Labrador.

1118
01:21:43,838 --> 01:21:45,129
How... How do they know?

1119
01:21:45,130 --> 01:21:49,004
Well, that's just it, sir,
they don't know, not exactly.

1120
01:21:49,005 --> 01:21:52,045
Well, when will we know, when it hits?

1121
01:21:52,046 --> 01:21:54,045
- Yes, Your Honour.
- That's too late.

1122
01:21:54,046 --> 01:21:55,254
I'm aware of that.

1123
01:21:55,255 --> 01:21:56,754
What do we do?

1124
01:22:42,171 --> 01:22:44,545
Mr Catilina, you've said that,

1125
01:22:44,546 --> 01:22:46,170
as we jump into the future,

1126
01:22:46,171 --> 01:22:48,295
we should do so unafraid.

1127
01:22:48,296 --> 01:22:50,587
But what if
when we do jump into the future,

1128
01:22:50,588 --> 01:22:52,463
there is something to be afraid of?

1129
01:23:03,588 --> 01:23:06,255
<i>Well, there's nothing to be afraid of
if you love.</i>

1130
01:23:07,588 --> 01:23:08,630
<i>Or have loved.</i>

1131
01:23:09,671 --> 01:23:12,213
<i>It's an unstoppable force.
It's unbreakable.</i>

1132
01:23:13,213 --> 01:23:14,421
<i>It has no limits,</i>

1133
01:23:15,838 --> 01:23:17,795
<i>it's within us, it's around us,</i>

1134
01:23:17,796 --> 01:23:19,546
<i>and it's stretched throughout time.</i>

1135
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:23,670
<i>It's nothing you can touch,</i>

1136
01:23:23,671 --> 01:23:25,755
<i>yet it guides every decision
that we make.</i>

1137
01:23:26,963 --> 01:23:29,004
<i>But we do have
the obligation to each other</i>

1138
01:23:29,005 --> 01:23:30,796
<i>to ask questions of one another.</i>

1139
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:32,880
<i>What can we do?</i>

1140
01:23:33,796 --> 01:23:36,795
<i>Is this society,
is this way we're living,</i>

1141
01:23:36,796 --> 01:23:38,630
<i>the only one that's available to us?</i>

1142
01:23:40,296 --> 01:23:42,046
<i>And when we ask these questions,</i>

1143
01:23:43,546 --> 01:23:45,338
<i>when there's a dialogue about them,</i>

1144
01:23:47,296 --> 01:23:49,046
<i>that basically is a utopia.</i>

1145
01:23:59,046 --> 01:24:00,337
<i>Ralph Waldo Emerson said,</i>

1146
01:24:00,338 --> 01:24:02,379
<i>"The end of the human race will be</i>

1147
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:04,671
<i>"that it will eventually die
of civilisation".</i>

1148
01:24:05,296 --> 01:24:06,713
<i>But trend is not destiny.</i>

1149
01:24:08,755 --> 01:24:09,796
Time,

1150
01:24:11,213 --> 01:24:12,546
show me the future.

1151
01:24:16,088 --> 01:24:18,170
<i>Together, we'll discover new paths,</i>

1152
01:24:18,171 --> 01:24:20,545
<i>which lead to the unknown
world ahead of us.</i>

1153
01:25:47,005 --> 01:25:48,879
<i>- You found me.
- I have good news.</i>

1154
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,670
<i>What's that,
what's your good news?</i>

1155
01:25:50,671 --> 01:25:52,337
<i>Those cigarettes, Cesar...</i>

1156
01:25:52,338 --> 01:25:54,379
<i>Why is there lipstick
on the cigarettes?</i>

1157
01:25:54,380 --> 01:25:55,712
<i>Are you really asking me</i>

1158
01:25:55,713 --> 01:25:57,712
<i>- why there's lipstick...
- Who's been in our home again?</i>

1159
01:25:57,713 --> 01:25:59,337
<i>I was at home
and not on a jury stand...</i>

1160
01:25:59,338 --> 01:26:01,504
<i>- Why do you do this?
- Where the judge is asking...</i>

1161
01:26:01,505 --> 01:26:03,629
<i>- You use that great brain of yours.
- Why do I do what?</i>

1162
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:04,754
<i>You manipulate. You blame.</i>

1163
01:26:04,755 --> 01:26:06,379
<i>Why do I use my brain
to find logical things...</i>

1164
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:07,962
<i>And try to make me
feel like I'm the crazy one.</i>

1165
01:26:07,963 --> 01:26:09,045
<i>As opposed to
hypothetical situations?</i>

1166
01:26:09,046 --> 01:26:10,254
<i>But I'm not the crazy one here.</i>

1167
01:26:10,255 --> 01:26:11,629
<i>I'm not trying to
tell you you're crazy,</i>

1168
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:12,920
<i>- but you're trying...
- You are, you are.</i>

1169
01:26:12,921 --> 01:26:14,337
<i>How are you
not trying to tell me I'm crazy?</i>

1170
01:26:14,338 --> 01:26:15,587
<i>You make me feel
that I'm imagining.</i>

1171
01:26:15,588 --> 01:26:17,087
<i>- It's not my imagination!
- It's so convenient...</i>

1172
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:18,379
<i>I'm so prepared, all I do...</i>

1173
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:20,295
<i>Save your dreaded heart,
our family together.</i>

1174
01:26:20,296 --> 01:26:24,337
<i>How long
will this madness of yours mock us?</i>

1175
01:26:37,588 --> 01:26:40,671
A man of the future
so possessed by the past...

1176
01:26:42,963 --> 01:26:45,380
Which is important now,
more than ever before.

1177
01:26:46,713 --> 01:26:47,838
Why now?

1178
01:26:57,880 --> 01:26:59,130
Can't you even guess?

1179
01:27:00,046 --> 01:27:01,213
No.

1180
01:27:08,005 --> 01:27:09,671
Can't you see it in my eyes?

1181
01:27:14,171 --> 01:27:18,880
The result of all our drunken
messing around?

1182
01:27:24,296 --> 01:27:25,796
A baby?

1183
01:27:28,630 --> 01:27:30,004
- Yeah.
- A baby?

1184
01:27:30,005 --> 01:27:31,379
A baby.

1185
01:27:37,796 --> 01:27:39,212
Let's get married.

1186
01:27:39,213 --> 01:27:42,920
Married? What is that?
We can't get married.

1187
01:27:42,921 --> 01:27:45,379
Why not? Of course we can. A baby!

1188
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:49,879
No, Cesar, you're in a moral pickle
of your own conscience.

1189
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,130
You're already married.

1190
01:27:53,588 --> 01:27:55,421
Why didn't you and Sunny
have children?

1191
01:27:58,255 --> 01:27:59,463
We were trying.

1192
01:28:03,130 --> 01:28:04,130
Sorry.

1193
01:28:11,338 --> 01:28:12,587
Anywhere in Megalopolis,

1194
01:28:12,588 --> 01:28:14,795
you'll be able to ride
one of these to a park

1195
01:28:14,796 --> 01:28:16,254
in less than five minutes.

1196
01:28:16,255 --> 01:28:18,879
- Would you like to try?
- I would love to try.

1197
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:20,087
Would you... Thank you.

1198
01:28:20,088 --> 01:28:22,546
All this is just
an exhibit, of course.

1199
01:28:23,838 --> 01:28:24,838
Frankie, come on.

1200
01:28:27,713 --> 01:28:28,921
Stick in the mud.

1201
01:28:30,130 --> 01:28:32,087
I mean, he comes up with magic

1202
01:28:32,088 --> 01:28:36,337
whenever he needs to sell something
to the people.

1203
01:28:40,088 --> 01:28:42,504
Frankie, come on, I'm floating.

1204
01:28:42,505 --> 01:28:44,088
Don't get it.

1205
01:28:45,255 --> 01:28:46,255
You will.

1206
01:28:46,713 --> 01:28:48,295
Plus, every adult,

1207
01:28:48,296 --> 01:28:51,296
every single adult will have
a private beautiful garden.

1208
01:28:52,630 --> 01:28:54,713
And I'll put this in, the kitchen.

1209
01:28:56,963 --> 01:28:58,046
Welcome to our home.

1210
01:29:00,713 --> 01:29:03,379
Cards, what fun.

1211
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:04,670
What should it be, poker?

1212
01:29:04,671 --> 01:29:06,879
Nickel-dime.
I've put beans on the table.

1213
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:10,880
Utopias offer no ready-made solutions.

1214
01:29:19,421 --> 01:29:21,212
Well, they're not meant to
offer solutions,

1215
01:29:21,213 --> 01:29:22,712
they're meant to
ask the right questions.

1216
01:29:22,713 --> 01:29:27,255
Yes, but...
utopias turn into dystopias.

1217
01:29:31,046 --> 01:29:35,670
So, we should just accept this
endless conflict that we live in now?

1218
01:29:35,671 --> 01:29:37,212
Wasn't it human friendliness

1219
01:29:37,213 --> 01:29:39,212
that stimulated our brains
by "learning",

1220
01:29:39,213 --> 01:29:41,837
and enabled us to out-compete
all the other species on earth?

1221
01:29:41,838 --> 01:29:43,379
Dear. Blah blah blah.

1222
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:45,504
It's a nice picture,
but how do we know?

1223
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:47,045
Well, there's no other way.

1224
01:29:47,046 --> 01:29:49,129
How else could such
a slow-maturing species

1225
01:29:49,130 --> 01:29:50,545
make it through the Ice Age?

1226
01:29:50,546 --> 01:29:52,212
- Now, boys...
- How could such few,

1227
01:29:52,213 --> 01:29:53,545
weak, bipedal apes

1228
01:29:53,546 --> 01:29:55,129
evolve more costly brains,

1229
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:56,712
smarter brains than other apes,

1230
01:29:56,713 --> 01:29:59,795
and do it without reproducing
so slowly they'd go extinct?

1231
01:30:01,838 --> 01:30:05,462
We were fierce, aggressive, war-like

1232
01:30:05,463 --> 01:30:08,837
as our closest ancestors, chimpanzees.

1233
01:30:08,838 --> 01:30:11,170
Yes, yes, but there were so few of us,

1234
01:30:11,171 --> 01:30:13,421
and scattered across a vast continent,

1235
01:30:14,296 --> 01:30:15,629
so... no.

1236
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:16,837
In or out,

1237
01:30:16,838 --> 01:30:19,712
are we playing cards
or reinventing history?

1238
01:30:19,713 --> 01:30:21,170
Where were we?
This is an enormous pot.

1239
01:30:21,171 --> 01:30:22,420
Cesar is winning.

1240
01:30:22,421 --> 01:30:26,045
"Civilisation itself remains
the great enemy of mankind."

1241
01:30:26,046 --> 01:30:27,255
Rousseau.

1242
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:29,213
You're quoting Petrarch,

1243
01:30:30,338 --> 01:30:32,837
to be accurate, misquoting him.

1244
01:30:32,838 --> 01:30:34,754
Julia can quote anyone.

1245
01:30:34,755 --> 01:30:36,295
- I...
- Humour me, please.

1246
01:30:36,296 --> 01:30:37,380
Daddy.

1247
01:30:38,630 --> 01:30:42,046
You remember. - I do, I remember.

1248
01:30:44,755 --> 01:30:47,255
Poise...

1249
01:30:50,213 --> 01:30:52,254
"It is the responsibility
of leadership

1250
01:30:52,255 --> 01:30:54,421
"to work intelligently
with what is given,

1251
01:30:55,421 --> 01:30:57,795
"and not waste time
fantasising about a world

1252
01:30:57,796 --> 01:30:59,880
"of flawless people
and perfect choices."

1253
01:31:00,588 --> 01:31:02,712
- Marcus Aurelius.
- Hear, hear.

1254
01:31:02,713 --> 01:31:03,880
Excellent.

1255
01:31:05,046 --> 01:31:06,963
Don't say your philosophy, Daddy,

1256
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:09,880
embody it.

1257
01:31:11,421 --> 01:31:14,546
"The object of life is not to be
on the side of the majority,

1258
01:31:17,921 --> 01:31:21,170
"but to escape finding yourself

1259
01:31:21,171 --> 01:31:23,005
"in the ranks of the insane."

1260
01:31:24,713 --> 01:31:26,671
Marcus Aurelius.

1261
01:31:29,546 --> 01:31:31,963
"The universe is change,

1262
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:36,130
"our life is what
our thoughts make it."

1263
01:31:39,505 --> 01:31:40,630
Marcus Aurelius.

1264
01:31:46,755 --> 01:31:48,420
Julia,

1265
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:50,879
there is no one like you,

1266
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,546
having such beautiful things
in your home.

1267
01:31:54,838 --> 01:31:57,587
And I understand
it can expand as needed?

1268
01:31:57,588 --> 01:31:58,671
Well, yes.

1269
01:31:59,713 --> 01:32:01,462
Now that we're going to have a baby.

1270
01:32:01,463 --> 01:32:04,420
- What?
- Darling!

1271
01:32:04,421 --> 01:32:07,879
If it's a girl,
she'll be given the name "Sunny Hope".

1272
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:09,879
And if it's a boy,

1273
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:11,587
he'll be named Francis.

1274
01:32:11,588 --> 01:32:12,671
Julia.

1275
01:32:15,088 --> 01:32:17,920
Daddy. Daddy, please.

1276
01:32:17,921 --> 01:32:19,213
Daddy, look at me.

1277
01:32:20,796 --> 01:32:23,505
In my eyes. It's me.

1278
01:32:27,713 --> 01:32:29,380
Could I love someone evil?

1279
01:32:35,838 --> 01:32:37,046
Frankie...

1280
01:32:38,255 --> 01:32:39,420
<i>Amor?</i>

1281
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:50,795
Daddy?

1282
01:32:50,796 --> 01:32:52,005
Daddy.

1283
01:32:57,796 --> 01:32:59,171
We fight for what we love.

1284
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:01,171
But we don't always win.

1285
01:33:02,796 --> 01:33:03,796
Julia.

1286
01:33:03,797 --> 01:33:05,504
Cesar, I...

1287
01:33:05,505 --> 01:33:06,671
I just...

1288
01:33:07,713 --> 01:33:09,338
I'm breaking his heart.

1289
01:33:11,630 --> 01:33:14,212
So what do you want to do,
do you want to leave?

1290
01:33:14,213 --> 01:33:15,421
No.

1291
01:33:31,421 --> 01:33:34,379
<i>It was a time
of excess and greed.</i>

1292
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:36,879
<i>No one was satisfied with the senate</i>

1293
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:42,462
<i>and practically everyone contemplated
the idea of change with pleasure.</i>

1294
01:33:45,255 --> 01:33:47,670
Hi, Channel 4!
What do you say?

1295
01:33:47,671 --> 01:33:49,795
Hi, <i>Crosstalk.</i>

1296
01:33:49,796 --> 01:33:53,337
Hi, TV, New Rome.

1297
01:33:53,338 --> 01:33:56,045
Hi, all news.

1298
01:33:56,046 --> 01:33:59,087
He has no boundaries.
And that's how you get into...

1299
01:33:59,088 --> 01:34:01,379
that makes a political leader.

1300
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:03,420
A little crazy, no boundaries,

1301
01:34:03,421 --> 01:34:05,661
- and he's an entertainer.
- Say, "Hi, all news".

1302
01:34:07,505 --> 01:34:10,671
That old fool Nush tried to muscle you
out of politics.

1303
01:34:16,963 --> 01:34:18,587
Yeah, well, he dropped dead,
and I won.

1304
01:34:18,588 --> 01:34:19,754
Don't you see what we built?

1305
01:34:19,755 --> 01:34:22,212
This is the dream, the unwanted,
the unneeded, the uneducated,

1306
01:34:22,213 --> 01:34:24,087
we're all together now.
Power to the people.

1307
01:34:24,088 --> 01:34:26,420
<i>- Power to the people!</i>
- Power to the people!

1308
01:34:26,421 --> 01:34:27,920
<i>Pulcher for the culture!</i>

1309
01:34:27,921 --> 01:34:29,462
Pulcher for the culture!

1310
01:34:29,463 --> 01:34:32,629
<i>- Cesar's not a pleaser!</i>
- Cesar's not a pleaser!

1311
01:34:32,630 --> 01:34:35,170
Pulcher for Alderman,
it's only me, no one else!

1312
01:34:35,171 --> 01:34:36,545
You can't name anyone else!

1313
01:34:36,546 --> 01:34:38,045
- It's just...
- Cesar Catilina!

1314
01:34:38,046 --> 01:34:39,255
Who said that?

1315
01:34:39,921 --> 01:34:41,670
Cesar Catilina!

1316
01:34:41,671 --> 01:34:43,505
<i>You shut the fuck up!</i>

1317
01:34:52,130 --> 01:34:56,713
Will no one rid me
of this fucking cousin?

1318
01:34:57,921 --> 01:34:59,505
Stop. Go film them.

1319
01:35:00,713 --> 01:35:01,879
Fuck Cesar!

1320
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:29,921
Catilina.

1321
01:35:34,338 --> 01:35:36,338
This is an unexpected visit, Cicero.

1322
01:35:39,713 --> 01:35:40,755
Call me Frank.

1323
01:35:43,963 --> 01:35:47,920
It's not Franklyn, but really Frank.

1324
01:35:47,921 --> 01:35:51,463
You know, like Sinatra, Francis.

1325
01:35:54,005 --> 01:35:57,713
Francis. Is this
Design Authority business?

1326
01:36:01,797 --> 01:36:04,338
There's something I need to say.

1327
01:36:05,796 --> 01:36:06,880
It's difficult.

1328
01:36:09,546 --> 01:36:10,546
May I?

1329
01:36:11,588 --> 01:36:12,588
Sure. Go on.

1330
01:36:17,671 --> 01:36:20,255
Please. I know I've attacked you,

1331
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:22,380
prosecuted you,

1332
01:36:24,505 --> 01:36:29,046
but you can't begin to know
what Julia means to me.

1333
01:36:32,213 --> 01:36:34,754
I'll give up everything.

1334
01:36:34,755 --> 01:36:37,755
Please, pass her by.

1335
01:36:38,421 --> 01:36:41,338
We both know what's best
for her and the child.

1336
01:36:43,088 --> 01:36:47,171
Let Julia go. Think of her.

1337
01:36:49,796 --> 01:36:52,963
If you could make her feel
you no longer love her...

1338
01:36:56,838 --> 01:36:59,713
I would put this in your hands.

1339
01:37:01,088 --> 01:37:03,713
It's my signed confession.

1340
01:37:11,838 --> 01:37:13,588
<i>Evidence about your wife's body.</i>

1341
01:37:14,588 --> 01:37:17,420
Now that Nush Berman is dead,
I can say it.

1342
01:37:17,421 --> 01:37:20,338
I was dishonest
in my prosecution of you.

1343
01:37:22,546 --> 01:37:24,255
Now, I can survive anything,

1344
01:37:25,463 --> 01:37:27,671
just not her

1345
01:37:28,296 --> 01:37:29,963
to know my complicity.

1346
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:35,630
This is your insurance policy.

1347
01:37:37,130 --> 01:37:39,338
Although I don't understand
what you're doing,

1348
01:37:41,213 --> 01:37:42,338
I will support you.

1349
01:37:45,088 --> 01:37:46,171
Privately

1350
01:37:48,171 --> 01:37:49,421
and publicly.

1351
01:37:51,296 --> 01:37:53,254
If you can do this for my family,

1352
01:37:53,255 --> 01:37:54,880
we will always be grateful.

1353
01:38:01,255 --> 01:38:03,296
I'll wait three days to hear from you.

1354
01:38:06,505 --> 01:38:07,588
Cicero.

1355
01:38:10,671 --> 01:38:13,546
There are only two things
impossible to stare at very long,

1356
01:38:15,255 --> 01:38:16,546
the sun

1357
01:38:17,755 --> 01:38:19,130
and your own soul.

1358
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,088
Wow, where's your coat?

1359
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:50,046
I waited with no coat
because I knew you'd give me yours.

1360
01:38:51,296 --> 01:38:52,546
And it would be warm.

1361
01:39:00,171 --> 01:39:01,380
It smells of you.

1362
01:39:02,921 --> 01:39:05,755
Sandalwood... citrus...

1363
01:39:07,755 --> 01:39:09,130
sweet male memories.

1364
01:39:10,921 --> 01:39:13,421
It can still all be yours, Cesar,

1365
01:39:14,963 --> 01:39:16,755
me and Crassus's bank,

1366
01:39:17,838 --> 01:39:20,255
which I'll steal
so I can give it to you.

1367
01:39:26,796 --> 01:39:27,963
Wow.

1368
01:39:45,296 --> 01:39:47,796
<i>I should really learn
more about banking, dear.</i>

1369
01:39:49,088 --> 01:39:51,087
I'm so bored all day.

1370
01:39:51,088 --> 01:39:52,630
That's no good.

1371
01:39:54,088 --> 01:39:57,046
And you want me to, right, darling?

1372
01:39:58,881 --> 01:40:00,505
You want me to take over?

1373
01:40:02,546 --> 01:40:04,587
- Yes.
- Yes.

1374
01:40:04,588 --> 01:40:06,755
I'll start with Cesar's accounts.

1375
01:40:08,588 --> 01:40:10,670
<i>Tonight on</i> Crosstalk.

1376
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:12,879
<i>Is Megalon
the path to a better life</i>

1377
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,295
<i>for you and your family?</i>

1378
01:40:14,296 --> 01:40:18,962
<i>Or is it the dream of an eccentric
mad scientist that could kill us all?</i>

1379
01:40:18,963 --> 01:40:20,712
<i>On</i> Crosstalk.

1380
01:40:20,713 --> 01:40:22,670
<i>Megalon is from outer space.</i>

1381
01:40:22,671 --> 01:40:24,170
<i>Open your window, man,</i>

1382
01:40:24,171 --> 01:40:26,337
<i>look at what's happening
in the streets.</i>

1383
01:40:26,338 --> 01:40:29,212
<i>The new revolution, man!
Sex, drugs, and Megalon!</i>

1384
01:40:29,213 --> 01:40:32,129
"Megalopolis Doesn't Fit Together!"

1385
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:34,545
"Megalon Deemed Unsafe by Experts."

1386
01:40:34,546 --> 01:40:36,670
- What are you doing?
- What bullshit.

1387
01:40:36,671 --> 01:40:39,462
What are you doing?
You can't park here.

1388
01:40:39,463 --> 01:40:41,337
This is a construction site.

1389
01:40:42,838 --> 01:40:44,837
You can't park here. Look!

1390
01:40:46,755 --> 01:40:49,838
You don't...
You don't understand. Okay.

1391
01:40:50,838 --> 01:40:52,004
- Okay. Okay.
- You got it.

1392
01:40:52,005 --> 01:40:53,920
I have to get home soon
to make dinner.

1393
01:40:53,921 --> 01:40:56,045
You have to move.
You have to move.

1394
01:40:56,046 --> 01:40:57,588
I'm just going to go say hi.

1395
01:40:58,421 --> 01:40:59,963
I'll deal with this guy.

1396
01:41:01,046 --> 01:41:03,213
You, get in your car,
you don't understand me?

1397
01:41:04,171 --> 01:41:07,420
Move! I said, get in your car
and move it. Let's go.

1398
01:41:07,421 --> 01:41:10,087
Let's go. Let's go!

1399
01:41:10,088 --> 01:41:11,671
Get in. Let's go!

1400
01:41:12,796 --> 01:41:15,504
- The mayor's waiting.
- Let's go. Let's go!

1401
01:41:15,505 --> 01:41:18,130
- Can I have your autograph?
- Of course you can.

1402
01:41:19,921 --> 01:41:21,379
- What's your name?
- Sam.

1403
01:41:21,380 --> 01:41:25,045
Sam. I love that name Sam,
it's to the point.

1404
01:41:25,046 --> 01:41:27,963
Cesar will never say no to a child.

1405
01:41:30,380 --> 01:41:32,087
"To Sam..." How old are you, Sam?

1406
01:41:32,088 --> 01:41:33,712
- I'm 12.
- Twelve.

1407
01:41:33,713 --> 01:41:35,879
I used to be 12,
you believe it or not.

1408
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:37,629
- Do I look 12 now?
- No.

1409
01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:39,296
Thank you, Sam.

1410
01:41:41,588 --> 01:41:43,671
All right, there you are, Sam.

1411
01:41:44,838 --> 01:41:45,962
Nice to meet you.

1412
01:41:45,963 --> 01:41:47,338
Nice to meet you too.

1413
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:52,462
No!

1414
01:41:52,463 --> 01:41:53,796
Boss!

1415
01:41:54,588 --> 01:41:56,213
Hey! Hey, stop!

1416
01:41:56,921 --> 01:41:58,545
Help him! Help him!

1417
01:42:07,213 --> 01:42:08,463
Come on.

1418
01:42:10,630 --> 01:42:13,420
<i>I will not let time
have dominion over my thoughts.</i>

1419
01:42:13,421 --> 01:42:15,255
<i>Have dominion over my thoughts.</i>

1420
01:42:17,130 --> 01:42:18,629
<i>I will not let time</i>

1421
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:21,004
<i>have dominion over my thoughts!</i>

1422
01:42:21,005 --> 01:42:23,712
<i>I will not let time
have dominion over my thoughts.</i>

1423
01:42:23,713 --> 01:42:24,837
<i>I will not let time have...</i>

1424
01:42:24,838 --> 01:42:27,379
<i>I will not let time have dominion...
my thoughts.</i>

1425
01:42:27,380 --> 01:42:31,254
<i>Let time... I will not let time
have dominion over my thoughts.</i>

1426
01:42:31,255 --> 01:42:32,420
<i>My thoughts...</i>

1427
01:42:32,421 --> 01:42:36,630
<i>I will not let time
have dominion over my thoughts.</i>

1428
01:42:52,088 --> 01:42:53,755
<i>Time, stop!</i>

1429
01:42:56,130 --> 01:42:58,671
<i>I'm here, my love.
I'm here, my love.</i>

1430
01:43:00,005 --> 01:43:01,795
<i>Megalon has no delineation,</i>

1431
01:43:01,796 --> 01:43:04,046
<i>knows no boundaries...</i>

1432
01:43:04,588 --> 01:43:06,962
<i>Megalon will activate
some of the signals</i>

1433
01:43:06,963 --> 01:43:08,379
<i>that will express genes,</i>

1434
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:12,754
<i>sub-atomic particles, atoms,
molecules, human connection...</i>

1435
01:43:12,755 --> 01:43:14,046
<i>Cesar.</i>

1436
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:18,045
Megalon fuses all forces...

1437
01:43:18,046 --> 01:43:21,837
<i>will activate some of the signals
that will express genes...</i>

1438
01:43:21,838 --> 01:43:25,421
<i>enabling Cesar to grow his face
like a second skin.</i>

1439
01:43:26,338 --> 01:43:28,129
<i>Do you have the cells?</i>

1440
01:43:28,130 --> 01:43:29,379
<i>It is a language.</i>

1441
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:30,504
Sunny's hair.

1442
01:43:30,505 --> 01:43:32,588
<i>We found
a sample of Sunny's hair.</i>

1443
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:37,295
<i>The first of its kind
bio-hybrid.</i>

1444
01:43:37,296 --> 01:43:39,420
<i>A living material</i>

1445
01:43:39,421 --> 01:43:42,463
<i>combining man-made
and nature-grown tissues.</i>

1446
01:43:43,546 --> 01:43:46,171
<i>The Megalon is the connection,
the signal.</i>

1447
01:43:50,546 --> 01:43:51,921
You think this is a joke?

1448
01:43:55,171 --> 01:43:57,587
You've made him a martyr,
you fucking idiot.

1449
01:43:57,588 --> 01:44:01,129
It's bad enough he won the Nobel,
now you've made him a martyr.

1450
01:44:01,130 --> 01:44:02,671
You're an ignoramus.

1451
01:44:04,588 --> 01:44:06,505
<i>Sic semper tyrannis!</i>

1452
01:44:15,630 --> 01:44:16,630
Sunny...

1453
01:44:16,631 --> 01:44:18,046
I'm here, honey.

1454
01:44:22,338 --> 01:44:23,838
I was desperate.

1455
01:44:25,213 --> 01:44:27,213
It's okay.

1456
01:44:32,005 --> 01:44:35,088
I discovered the principle of Megalon

1457
01:44:37,421 --> 01:44:39,380
trying to save her life.

1458
01:45:03,713 --> 01:45:05,130
<i>The red envelope...</i>

1459
01:45:06,671 --> 01:45:07,755
<i>Cicero.</i>

1460
01:45:09,713 --> 01:45:11,421
<i>Something never disclosed.</i>

1461
01:45:12,713 --> 01:45:16,629
<i>The embodiment
of all my desires and regrets</i>

1462
01:45:16,630 --> 01:45:18,338
<i>were named Jane Doe.</i>

1463
01:45:19,713 --> 01:45:20,755
<i>My mania,</i>

1464
01:45:22,255 --> 01:45:23,755
<i>my obsessions,</i>

1465
01:45:25,046 --> 01:45:26,713
<i>my greatest loss,</i>

1466
01:45:28,171 --> 01:45:29,421
<i>Jane Doe.</i>

1467
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,755
<i>Condemned with the truth.</i>

1468
01:45:34,755 --> 01:45:39,796
<i>Truths, found in the coldest,
darkest morgue of our heart.</i>

1469
01:45:40,755 --> 01:45:42,796
Be with her.

1470
01:45:45,755 --> 01:45:47,462
<i>She came home with good news,</i>

1471
01:45:47,463 --> 01:45:49,755
<i>but saw something
that enraged her jealousy.</i>

1472
01:45:50,630 --> 01:45:53,712
<i>I followed, but I saw her
drive over the bridge,</i>

1473
01:45:53,713 --> 01:45:55,671
<i>and into the icy water.</i>

1474
01:45:56,296 --> 01:45:59,545
<i>And in that madness, it came to me.</i>

1475
01:45:59,546 --> 01:46:03,712
<i>I discovered the principle of Megalon
trying to save her life.</i>

1476
01:46:03,713 --> 01:46:05,796
<i>She said she had good news...</i>

1477
01:46:06,755 --> 01:46:07,796
<i>her secret.</i>

1478
01:46:17,088 --> 01:46:19,338
<i>And then all was lost to me forever.</i>

1479
01:46:24,380 --> 01:46:25,838
This is my heart.

1480
01:46:37,631 --> 01:46:40,420
No, no, no, no, no,

1481
01:46:40,421 --> 01:46:43,379
no, no, no, no! No, no!

1482
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:45,130
We're here to see Crassus.

1483
01:46:45,921 --> 01:46:47,879
Someone froze our accounts.

1484
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:50,379
- Someone's messing with the...
- No, no, no, no, no!

1485
01:46:50,380 --> 01:46:52,546
I'll be in the car
if you need me, okay?

1486
01:46:53,630 --> 01:46:54,630
What...

1487
01:47:06,046 --> 01:47:08,546
You know, when I heard you were shot,
I was pissed...

1488
01:47:10,171 --> 01:47:11,838
that I didn't get to do it myself.

1489
01:47:14,630 --> 01:47:16,504
It's a joke.

1490
01:47:16,505 --> 01:47:19,045
But you never had a sense of humour.

1491
01:47:20,463 --> 01:47:21,754
I have a sense of humour.

1492
01:47:21,755 --> 01:47:23,921
And I have everything else
that you have.

1493
01:47:25,921 --> 01:47:28,754
Brains, family,

1494
01:47:28,755 --> 01:47:30,712
name, talent.

1495
01:47:30,713 --> 01:47:33,295
It's injected the wrong way,
but I share your passions.

1496
01:47:33,296 --> 01:47:34,879
Creation...

1497
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:35,963
Creation...

1498
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:38,712
destruction.

1499
01:47:38,713 --> 01:47:40,005
You know, your way,

1500
01:47:40,921 --> 01:47:42,879
it's meticulous and it's hygienic,

1501
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,838
but it's fucking soulless.

1502
01:47:45,755 --> 01:47:48,046
And my way is real, and I want it.

1503
01:47:48,671 --> 01:47:52,379
I want it all. I want the moon.

1504
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:53,920
And I'm going to have it.

1505
01:47:53,921 --> 01:47:55,130
Clodio.

1506
01:48:04,171 --> 01:48:05,213
Creation...

1507
01:48:08,921 --> 01:48:12,129
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1508
01:48:13,671 --> 01:48:16,880
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1509
01:48:19,921 --> 01:48:22,129
Darling, what is it?

1510
01:48:37,630 --> 01:48:39,421
Our accounts are frozen.

1511
01:48:44,213 --> 01:48:48,213
I'm in a position where I can do
all kinds of things on my own, Cesar.

1512
01:49:15,213 --> 01:49:16,255
My God...

1513
01:49:23,796 --> 01:49:25,588
It can all be yours, Cesar,

1514
01:49:27,671 --> 01:49:28,838
everything.

1515
01:49:32,713 --> 01:49:35,880
These diamonds mean nothing to me.

1516
01:49:44,796 --> 01:49:45,963
Take me.

1517
01:49:51,296 --> 01:49:52,671
Take my love.

1518
01:49:56,546 --> 01:49:57,671
Cesar!

1519
01:49:58,630 --> 01:50:00,255
Come in. Come in, Cesar.

1520
01:50:09,630 --> 01:50:11,504
You got to be careful?

1521
01:50:11,505 --> 01:50:13,045
Yeah. Okay.

1522
01:50:13,046 --> 01:50:15,045
You just sit right here.

1523
01:50:15,046 --> 01:50:16,130
Here. Here.

1524
01:50:18,755 --> 01:50:20,212
Let me just see...

1525
01:50:20,213 --> 01:50:21,880
I came to ask why...

1526
01:50:24,005 --> 01:50:25,505
our accounts are frozen.

1527
01:50:27,713 --> 01:50:28,921
Frozen?

1528
01:50:30,546 --> 01:50:32,588
Must be a mistake, son.

1529
01:50:34,296 --> 01:50:36,838
- Wow, do you know anything about this?
- "Moxie".

1530
01:50:40,046 --> 01:50:41,963
- Uncle...
- Yes.

1531
01:50:43,546 --> 01:50:44,880
Be remembered...

1532
01:50:47,963 --> 01:50:49,671
for your generosity.

1533
01:50:51,338 --> 01:50:54,295
Remembered?

1534
01:50:54,296 --> 01:50:56,130
I'm not going anywhere.

1535
01:50:58,588 --> 01:51:02,255
What's a seven-letter word
for "God's revenge on mankind"?

1536
01:51:06,046 --> 01:51:07,046
Pandora.

1537
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:08,880
Bingo.

1538
01:51:22,796 --> 01:51:23,880
Huey.

1539
01:51:28,671 --> 01:51:30,920
- Pick up my hat.
- Pick up my hat.

1540
01:51:30,921 --> 01:51:32,255
Pick up my hat.

1541
01:51:38,130 --> 01:51:39,462
<i>Going up.</i>

1542
01:51:39,463 --> 01:51:41,171
Yes, we are.

1543
01:51:41,838 --> 01:51:45,420
We are going up,
and they are going down.

1544
01:51:45,421 --> 01:51:48,212
We just have to get
our affairs in order,

1545
01:51:48,213 --> 01:51:50,879
tell all the little boys what to do.

1546
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:54,630
One, two, three, yippee yay.

1547
01:51:57,838 --> 01:51:58,838
Hello.

1548
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:01,130
Do you like my outfit?

1549
01:52:03,171 --> 01:52:05,337
Yes, it's beautiful, Wow.

1550
01:52:05,338 --> 01:52:07,088
Yes, Auntie Wow.

1551
01:52:07,963 --> 01:52:10,046
Yes, it's beautiful, Auntie Wow.

1552
01:52:11,421 --> 01:52:13,005
Does it make my ass look good?

1553
01:52:13,838 --> 01:52:14,963
I can't see it.

1554
01:52:19,005 --> 01:52:21,130
Yes, it's beautiful, Auntie Wow.

1555
01:52:28,089 --> 01:52:29,213
Kiss it.

1556
01:52:30,796 --> 01:52:33,629
Grandpa Crassus is beginning to doubt

1557
01:52:33,630 --> 01:52:35,379
that you're giving up on politics.

1558
01:52:35,380 --> 01:52:40,880
You are a very bad, bad boy.

1559
01:52:41,713 --> 01:52:43,879
But you're lucky,

1560
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:47,045
because Auntie Wow
has come here to help you.

1561
01:52:48,463 --> 01:52:50,587
- Are you lucky?
- Yes.

1562
01:52:50,588 --> 01:52:53,463
- Yes what?
- Yes, Auntie Wow.

1563
01:52:56,963 --> 01:52:58,795
- What's that?
- That's your pussy.

1564
01:52:58,796 --> 01:53:00,045
I said, what is that?

1565
01:53:00,046 --> 01:53:02,295
That's Cesar's Megalopolis
using up the city's power.

1566
01:53:02,296 --> 01:53:03,587
Think it's all over the city?

1567
01:53:03,588 --> 01:53:05,545
- It's all over the city.
- Do you want to fuck me?

1568
01:53:05,546 --> 01:53:08,005
I want to fuck you so bad, Auntie Wow.

1569
01:53:10,255 --> 01:53:12,337
Then take your pants off
and get on the table.

1570
01:53:12,338 --> 01:53:14,295
Yes, Auntie Wow.

1571
01:53:14,296 --> 01:53:15,505
Now,

1572
01:53:16,671 --> 01:53:20,004
your grandfather insisted
on a prenuptial agreement

1573
01:53:20,005 --> 01:53:22,129
so that I can't inherit his bank.

1574
01:53:22,130 --> 01:53:23,213
Therefore...

1575
01:53:25,505 --> 01:53:27,338
you and I are going to do a takeover.

1576
01:53:27,838 --> 01:53:29,921
You and your Auntie Wow,

1577
01:53:31,130 --> 01:53:32,296
and she knows how.

1578
01:53:35,046 --> 01:53:36,296
Yes, Auntie Wow.

1579
01:53:40,255 --> 01:53:44,879
- One, you will suggest to Crassus...
- Yes.

1580
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:48,004
That you become interim CEO
of his bank,

1581
01:53:48,005 --> 01:53:50,796
that they draft up a memo
of his support

1582
01:53:52,213 --> 01:53:54,504
- and that you two work...
- Fuck!

1583
01:53:54,505 --> 01:53:55,920
On a "term sheet" together.

1584
01:53:55,921 --> 01:53:58,254
- We're gonna work on a term sheet...
- Yeah.

1585
01:53:58,255 --> 01:54:00,087
- Auntie Wow.
- You understand?

1586
01:54:00,088 --> 01:54:02,337
- Now, he'll think...
- Yes.

1587
01:54:02,338 --> 01:54:04,879
That he's going to remain
Chairman and CEO...

1588
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:06,004
But he won't.

1589
01:54:06,005 --> 01:54:08,087
And keep you as interim CEO.

1590
01:54:08,088 --> 01:54:10,462
- Two, when he does that...
- Two.

1591
01:54:10,463 --> 01:54:11,629
Yes.

1592
01:54:11,630 --> 01:54:14,420
You're going to refuse, okay?

1593
01:54:14,421 --> 01:54:16,045
I'll say, "No, no!"

1594
01:54:16,046 --> 01:54:18,504
And then all the friendly talks
are going to fall apart.

1595
01:54:18,505 --> 01:54:20,129
Okay.

1596
01:54:20,130 --> 01:54:22,212
<i>- You like obeying me, don't you?
- Yes.</i>

1597
01:54:22,213 --> 01:54:25,212
I've come to ask
if you'd consider saying

1598
01:54:25,213 --> 01:54:27,504
you support my becoming interim CEO.

1599
01:54:27,505 --> 01:54:29,337
- You cut your hair.
- I did.

1600
01:54:29,338 --> 01:54:31,795
You're making an effort, good!

1601
01:54:31,796 --> 01:54:33,045
Well, what I would need is,

1602
01:54:33,046 --> 01:54:35,254
I would need a memo
from the board, Grandpa,

1603
01:54:35,255 --> 01:54:37,380
saying you support
my becoming interim CEO.

1604
01:54:40,505 --> 01:54:41,963
You're a banker now.

1605
01:54:45,130 --> 01:54:46,171
I'm proud of you.

1606
01:54:47,130 --> 01:54:48,670
Yeah, I'll give you a title,

1607
01:54:48,671 --> 01:54:50,171
teach you the game.

1608
01:54:52,130 --> 01:54:53,171
Wait,

1609
01:54:54,546 --> 01:54:56,295
this term sheet says

1610
01:54:56,296 --> 01:54:59,795
that you would be
interim CEO and Chairman.

1611
01:54:59,796 --> 01:55:02,087
Well, yeah. I mean, I don't know.

1612
01:55:02,088 --> 01:55:04,963
Interim CEO...

1613
01:55:06,463 --> 01:55:07,838
And I would retire.

1614
01:55:10,171 --> 01:55:11,212
It's not friendly.

1615
01:55:13,046 --> 01:55:16,837
This is hostile. This is treacherous!

1616
01:55:16,838 --> 01:55:18,379
- I didn't mean...
- Villainous!

1617
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:19,795
I didn't mean it to be hostile!

1618
01:55:19,796 --> 01:55:21,254
Whose name is this?

1619
01:55:21,255 --> 01:55:23,087
I thought it was inevitable.

1620
01:55:23,088 --> 01:55:24,712
- Who signed this?
- Just stay still, please.

1621
01:55:24,713 --> 01:55:25,879
I did what you asked.

1622
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:28,879
- Yes, indeed. Grandpa, please.
- No! No!

1623
01:55:30,463 --> 01:55:33,045
- Get away from me! No!
- Please, you have to lie down!

1624
01:55:33,046 --> 01:55:34,295
I can't...

1625
01:55:37,130 --> 01:55:38,171
Mr Crassus!

1626
01:55:39,796 --> 01:55:42,838
<i>God, it was you
who gave me my fortune.</i>

1627
01:55:43,838 --> 01:55:46,170
<i>And It will be the will of Chronos</i>

1628
01:55:46,171 --> 01:55:47,963
<i>to seek our revenge.</i>

1629
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:00,795
<i>"Let us fall in love again</i>

1630
01:56:00,796 --> 01:56:04,337
<i>"and scatter gold dust
all over the world.</i>

1631
01:56:04,338 --> 01:56:06,379
<i>"Let us become a new spring</i>

1632
01:56:06,380 --> 01:56:09,213
<i>"and feel the breeze
drift in heaven's scent.</i>

1633
01:56:10,046 --> 01:56:13,712
"Let us dress the earth in green
and like the sap of a young tree,

1634
01:56:13,713 --> 01:56:15,962
"let the grace from within sustain us.

1635
01:56:17,046 --> 01:56:19,962
"Let us carve gems
out of our stony hearts

1636
01:56:19,963 --> 01:56:22,255
"and let them light our path to Love.

1637
01:56:23,005 --> 01:56:25,712
"The glance of Love is crystal clear

1638
01:56:25,713 --> 01:56:27,379
"and we are blessed by it."

1639
01:56:34,546 --> 01:56:36,921
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1640
01:57:12,588 --> 01:57:16,087
<i>Happy Saturnalia to you!</i>

1641
01:57:16,088 --> 01:57:20,170
<i>Happy Saturnalia to everyone!</i>

1642
01:57:20,171 --> 01:57:24,380
<i>Happy Saturnalia to you!</i>

1643
01:57:53,338 --> 01:57:54,630
Okay, gentlemen,

1644
01:57:55,338 --> 01:57:57,880
deliver.

1645
01:57:59,213 --> 01:58:01,380
This is an inside takeover.

1646
01:58:02,671 --> 01:58:03,755
Begin.

1647
01:58:08,380 --> 01:58:14,505
<i>O beautiful for spacious skies</i>

1648
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:19,795
<i>For amber waves of grain</i>

1649
01:58:19,796 --> 01:58:22,754
<i>For purple mountain...</i>

1650
01:58:22,755 --> 01:58:24,296
Doesn't that feel good?

1651
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:27,129
Cause for celebration.

1652
01:58:27,130 --> 01:58:29,088
Now get the fuck out of my car.

1653
01:58:30,963 --> 01:58:36,295
<i>America! America!</i>

1654
01:58:36,296 --> 01:58:40,630
The move is final
as of 11:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time.

1655
01:58:42,046 --> 01:58:47,420
<i>And crown thy good with brotherhood</i>

1656
01:58:47,421 --> 01:58:53,129
<i>From sea to shining sea!</i>

1657
01:58:53,130 --> 01:58:55,504
Now that
the new board is installed,

1658
01:58:55,505 --> 01:58:56,587
and has voted...

1659
01:58:56,588 --> 01:58:59,045
Speak louder, I'm hard of hearing!

1660
01:58:59,046 --> 01:59:02,129
The board has voted
to remove Hamilton Crassus

1661
01:59:02,130 --> 01:59:05,337
from the office of CEO
of Crassus National Bank.

1662
01:59:05,338 --> 01:59:06,879
<i>Arigato.</i>

1663
01:59:07,963 --> 01:59:09,462
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1664
01:59:09,463 --> 01:59:10,795
We got the bank,

1665
01:59:10,796 --> 01:59:12,213
now unleash the mob.

1666
01:59:24,546 --> 01:59:27,463
<i>Nam si violandum est jus,</i>

1667
01:59:27,588 --> 01:59:31,338
<i>aliis rebus pietatem colas</i>.

1668
01:59:31,921 --> 01:59:33,670
<i>Be just,</i>

1669
01:59:33,671 --> 01:59:36,129
<i>unless a kingdom tempts
to break the laws,</i>

1670
01:59:36,130 --> 01:59:40,129
<i>for sovereign power alone
can justify the cause.</i>

1671
01:59:43,463 --> 01:59:47,045
<i>Where is Cesar now?
Where is his Megalopolis?</i>

1672
01:59:47,046 --> 01:59:49,462
<i>We've waited long enough, no?</i>

1673
01:59:49,463 --> 01:59:52,420
<i>If you don't fight like hell,
we're gonna lose the city.</i>

1674
01:59:52,421 --> 01:59:54,379
<i>Keep what's ours.</i>

1675
01:59:54,380 --> 01:59:55,837
<i>Cesar has failed,</i>

1676
01:59:55,838 --> 01:59:58,254
<i>Cicero has failed.</i>

1677
01:59:58,255 --> 01:59:59,587
<i>The city is ours!</i>

1678
01:59:59,588 --> 02:00:01,837
<i>Attention, attention.</i>

1679
02:00:01,838 --> 02:00:05,087
Murder and violence
stalk our streets...

1680
02:00:05,088 --> 02:00:06,837
<i>We are here,</i>

1681
02:00:06,838 --> 02:00:08,379
<i>we are powerful,</i>

1682
02:00:08,380 --> 02:00:10,921
<i>and we are taking our country back!</i>

1683
02:00:12,046 --> 02:00:13,420
<i>Pulcher for the culture!</i>

1684
02:00:13,421 --> 02:00:16,004
We are threatened by evil men.

1685
02:00:16,005 --> 02:00:19,004
New Rome, the greatest country

1686
02:00:19,005 --> 02:00:21,462
the world has ever known,
is threatened

1687
02:00:21,463 --> 02:00:23,920
<i>by those men
who propose to take charge</i>

1688
02:00:23,921 --> 02:00:25,754
<i>of the affairs of the government.</i>

1689
02:00:25,755 --> 02:00:27,045
<i>Fuck Cesar!</i>

1690
02:00:27,046 --> 02:00:29,921
<i>Fuck the Mayor, and fuck City Hall!</i>

1691
02:00:31,838 --> 02:00:34,546
<i>Back away
from the gate of City Hall.</i>

1692
02:00:38,921 --> 02:00:42,004
Commissioner?
Over here, the train's coming.

1693
02:00:48,130 --> 02:00:49,712
<i>This is an illegal gathering.</i>

1694
02:00:49,713 --> 02:00:51,379
What have you done
with Megalopolis?

1695
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:52,755
Where's Megalopolis?

1696
02:00:53,463 --> 02:00:56,088
Hold the line!
Hold the line!

1697
02:01:05,963 --> 02:01:07,005
Mayor Cicero?

1698
02:01:12,255 --> 02:01:13,921
There's another car coming, guys.

1699
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:18,380
The mayor's extraction
is underway. Over.

1700
02:01:21,255 --> 02:01:22,255
Hi...

1701
02:01:23,338 --> 02:01:24,630
Hi.

1702
02:01:27,463 --> 02:01:29,630
May... May I hold her?

1703
02:01:31,130 --> 02:01:33,212
Yeah. It's your grandpa.

1704
02:01:33,213 --> 02:01:34,337
Hi...

1705
02:01:34,338 --> 02:01:35,880
- Who's that?
- Hi...

1706
02:01:40,255 --> 02:01:42,546
I used to hold you like this.

1707
02:01:47,921 --> 02:01:50,212
- Look at you.
- Look, she likes you.

1708
02:01:50,213 --> 02:01:51,630
Yeah.

1709
02:01:52,505 --> 02:01:56,255
You're holding the future
in your hands.

1710
02:01:57,338 --> 02:01:59,213
Don't you want a better world for her?

1711
02:02:00,046 --> 02:02:04,629
Cesar is a reckless dreamer
who will destroy the world

1712
02:02:04,630 --> 02:02:07,755
sooner than he can build a better one.

1713
02:02:16,630 --> 02:02:18,921
Can't you and I
be like we were before?

1714
02:02:22,171 --> 02:02:23,171
Could we?

1715
02:02:24,421 --> 02:02:25,879
Can't we, Julia?

1716
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:29,130
My little girl, my angel?

1717
02:02:36,046 --> 02:02:37,171
Trust us.

1718
02:02:40,713 --> 02:02:42,046
Trust me, Daddy.

1719
02:02:51,963 --> 02:02:53,130
There's been some news.

1720
02:02:54,546 --> 02:02:56,462
The rioters have been pushed back,

1721
02:02:56,463 --> 02:02:57,838
and the road's cleared.

1722
02:02:58,671 --> 02:02:59,671
Thank God.

1723
02:03:04,755 --> 02:03:06,420
<i>Earlier today has devolved</i>

1724
02:03:06,421 --> 02:03:08,254
<i>- into a scene of violence.</i>
- America,

1725
02:03:08,255 --> 02:03:12,920
master of the known world,
is now kaput.

1726
02:03:15,255 --> 02:03:17,296
Be quiet for once
and follow my lead.

1727
02:03:25,297 --> 02:03:26,838
Our poor Robin Hood.

1728
02:03:29,505 --> 02:03:31,295
He doesn't have much time left,

1729
02:03:31,296 --> 02:03:32,587
but he wanted to see you.

1730
02:03:32,588 --> 02:03:34,754
Well, he's not one
to give up on things.

1731
02:03:34,755 --> 02:03:36,171
He can barely speak.

1732
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:42,255
We came to pay our respects, Grandpa.

1733
02:03:43,171 --> 02:03:46,670
What do you think of this boner I got?

1734
02:03:48,546 --> 02:03:51,045
One look at her and I'm up...

1735
02:03:53,630 --> 02:03:55,963
If it wasn't for this,

1736
02:03:57,463 --> 02:04:00,713
I would have been
able to out-spend you

1737
02:04:02,171 --> 02:04:03,545
in the end.

1738
02:04:03,546 --> 02:04:05,295
But I will

1739
02:04:05,296 --> 02:04:07,045
outlive you.

1740
02:04:07,046 --> 02:04:08,130
Wow,

1741
02:04:08,963 --> 02:04:12,671
you Wall Street slut,
this is your closing bell.

1742
02:04:15,963 --> 02:04:17,045
What?

1743
02:04:17,046 --> 02:04:18,337
No.

1744
02:04:18,338 --> 02:04:20,462
No, Auntie Wow.

1745
02:04:20,463 --> 02:04:22,087
No, no, no.

1746
02:04:27,588 --> 02:04:29,004
Fuck!

1747
02:04:39,713 --> 02:04:42,421
<i>The gods have decreed
that history teach us,</i>

1748
02:04:43,213 --> 02:04:47,379
<i>all that is needed is a slight push
to send our republic toppling.</i>

1749
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:50,795
<i>For it is in the power
of any daring man</i>

1750
02:04:50,796 --> 02:04:54,630
<i>to overturn a sickly commonwealth.</i>

1751
02:04:55,463 --> 02:04:57,129
<i>You are here illegally.</i>

1752
02:04:57,130 --> 02:04:59,420
<i>Go home or you will be arrested.</i>

1753
02:05:01,796 --> 02:05:05,087
<i>Put down your weapons
and go back to your homes, please.</i>

1754
02:05:09,213 --> 02:05:10,338
Cesar is alive!

1755
02:05:12,046 --> 02:05:13,588
<i>We need you to stop!</i>

1756
02:05:14,921 --> 02:05:16,379
Man.

1757
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:23,088
What is that?

1758
02:05:26,463 --> 02:05:27,796
What do we know of him?

1759
02:05:30,630 --> 02:05:31,713
His gods?

1760
02:05:36,421 --> 02:05:37,463
<i>Liberty...</i>

1761
02:05:41,546 --> 02:05:42,546
<i>love...</i>

1762
02:05:46,630 --> 02:05:47,796
<i>kindness,</i>

1763
02:05:49,838 --> 02:05:50,880
<i>mind,</i>

1764
02:05:52,921 --> 02:05:54,088
death,

1765
02:05:54,921 --> 02:05:55,921
destiny.

1766
02:06:01,046 --> 02:06:02,088
Destiny.

1767
02:06:06,338 --> 02:06:08,380
I'm not concerned
with my place in history.

1768
02:06:11,255 --> 02:06:12,963
What I am concerned about is time,

1769
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:16,380
consciousness, and courage.

1770
02:06:18,171 --> 02:06:19,588
But what is time,

1771
02:06:21,463 --> 02:06:25,296
except a curve
of past and future around us?

1772
02:06:26,296 --> 02:06:27,546
What is consciousness,

1773
02:06:28,755 --> 02:06:30,921
except a burst of the soul
from inside?

1774
02:06:32,296 --> 02:06:34,129
And what is courage,

1775
02:06:34,130 --> 02:06:37,171
but the beginning
of a vital conversation?

1776
02:06:38,630 --> 02:06:42,088
We're in need of a great debate
about the future!

1777
02:06:43,088 --> 02:06:46,670
We want every person in the world
to take part in that debate.

1778
02:06:46,671 --> 02:06:51,087
This city is threatened by unusual

1779
02:06:51,088 --> 02:06:53,379
- and dire circumstances...
- Wait, Your Honour.

1780
02:06:53,380 --> 02:06:55,588
- We have...
- Your Honour, listen.

1781
02:06:56,505 --> 02:06:57,796
He's incriminating himself.

1782
02:06:59,046 --> 02:07:00,880
Tear down debt!

1783
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:05,254
Tear down the world
of ready-made slums

1784
02:07:05,255 --> 02:07:07,713
that those families that run the world
shove you into.

1785
02:07:09,963 --> 02:07:14,213
You were born with the option
to be what you want to be,

1786
02:07:16,255 --> 02:07:17,463
and must!

1787
02:07:19,463 --> 02:07:21,463
Cesar! Cesar Catilina!

1788
02:07:23,130 --> 02:07:27,130
Let it not be said that
we reduced ourselves to be brutes

1789
02:07:29,088 --> 02:07:31,130
and mindless beasts of burden.

1790
02:07:36,421 --> 02:07:40,255
The human being shall rightly
be called a great miracle,

1791
02:07:42,463 --> 02:07:44,921
and a living creature
for all to admire!

1792
02:07:47,671 --> 02:07:50,796
We are such stuff
as dreams are made of.

1793
02:07:52,421 --> 02:07:53,588
- Yes!
- Yes!

1794
02:07:55,630 --> 02:07:56,630
Catilina!

1795
02:07:57,796 --> 02:08:00,380
Hail, New Rome!
Hail, Megalopolis!

1796
02:08:03,671 --> 02:08:06,670
<i>Our Mother Earth
gave us the genius</i>

1797
02:08:06,671 --> 02:08:09,587
<i>to see a future so beautiful</i>

1798
02:08:09,588 --> 02:08:11,255
<i>that we can't let it be denied.</i>

1799
02:08:18,421 --> 02:08:20,713
<i>The gates of Megalopolis are open!</i>

1800
02:08:25,380 --> 02:08:30,045
<i>Go now, and know
our world is changed forever!</i>

1801
02:08:51,005 --> 02:08:53,462
Evoke the contingency clause.

1802
02:08:53,463 --> 02:08:57,045
I'm going to leave
the patents to Megalon,

1803
02:08:57,046 --> 02:08:59,421
the bank, my entire fortune,

1804
02:09:00,421 --> 02:09:04,213
to Cesar's Garden of Eden,
to Megalopolis!

1805
02:09:04,755 --> 02:09:07,670
I'll be known as
"Crassus the Generous",

1806
02:09:07,671 --> 02:09:10,129
loved for eternity!

1807
02:09:10,130 --> 02:09:12,337
Yeah, go, go.

1808
02:09:12,338 --> 02:09:13,545
- One more.
- Wait!

1809
02:09:13,546 --> 02:09:14,629
All right.

1810
02:09:14,630 --> 02:09:15,837
- One more.
- Okay.

1811
02:09:15,838 --> 02:09:17,337
- Ready, and pull!
- Yeah, go, go, go.

1812
02:09:18,463 --> 02:09:20,670
You threw us under the bus,
you piece of shit.

1813
02:09:20,671 --> 02:09:22,004
- Yeah?
- Where'd all the money go?

1814
02:09:22,005 --> 02:09:23,629
- The team!
- You double-crossed us.

1815
02:09:23,630 --> 02:09:24,712
"Don't tread on me!"

1816
02:09:24,713 --> 02:09:26,420
- You double-crossed us!
- You own the bank?

1817
02:09:26,421 --> 02:09:27,504
You used us.

1818
02:09:27,505 --> 02:09:29,795
So much for your loyal base, asshole,
what'd I tell you!

1819
02:09:29,796 --> 02:09:31,129
"No crutches, no crosses!"

1820
02:09:31,130 --> 02:09:32,545
Tie him up!

1821
02:09:34,463 --> 02:09:36,670
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

1822
02:09:36,671 --> 02:09:37,755
Help!

1823
02:09:38,755 --> 02:09:43,838
Help me, Grandpa!

1824
02:09:54,588 --> 02:09:55,588
Thank you.

1825
02:09:57,421 --> 02:09:58,421
Come on.

1826
02:09:59,755 --> 02:10:00,837
Please.

1827
02:10:04,755 --> 02:10:06,171
Come on, Frankie.

1828
02:10:08,421 --> 02:10:09,630
Teri...

1829
02:10:12,380 --> 02:10:13,712
Darling.

1830
02:10:24,463 --> 02:10:25,921
Happy New Year!

1831
02:10:31,088 --> 02:10:33,337
Good to see you! Good to see you!

1832
02:10:33,338 --> 02:10:35,254
Happy New Year!

1833
02:10:35,255 --> 02:10:36,379
Happy New Year!

1834
02:10:36,380 --> 02:10:38,338
Happy New Year, everybody!

1835
02:10:39,796 --> 02:10:42,005
Happy New Year!

1836
02:10:45,255 --> 02:10:48,088
We've got a new year...

1837
02:10:55,838 --> 02:10:58,421
- Happy New Year!
- Mwah!

1838
02:10:59,421 --> 02:11:00,630
Happy New Year!

1839
02:11:02,130 --> 02:11:04,338
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

1840
02:11:23,963 --> 02:11:25,088
Mother.

1841
02:11:26,796 --> 02:11:28,588
While I'm here, can I just have one?

1842
02:11:37,588 --> 02:11:39,671
There's still so much to accomplish...

1843
02:11:41,296 --> 02:11:42,338
but is there time?

1844
02:11:44,296 --> 02:11:46,546
Promise me, you will build nobly.

1845
02:11:47,588 --> 02:11:48,670
Yes, Dad. We promise.

1846
02:11:48,671 --> 02:11:49,755
Yes,

1847
02:11:51,338 --> 02:11:52,505
be assured.

1848
02:12:00,088 --> 02:12:01,546
Build a future for her.

1849
02:12:09,421 --> 02:12:12,379
- Julia...
- Ten, nine...

1850
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:15,962
- stop time.
- Eight, seven, six,

1851
02:12:15,963 --> 02:12:18,546
- five, four...
- Now, time, stop!

1852
02:12:36,130 --> 02:12:39,504
<i>I pledge allegiance
to our human family,</i>

1853
02:12:39,505 --> 02:12:43,588
<i>and to all the species

1854
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:49,462
<i>One earth, indivisible,

1856
02:12:51,421 --> 02:12:53,463
<i>Education and justice for all.</i>

1857
02:13:09,213 --> 02:13:11,671
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

1858
02:13:24,796 --> 02:13:28,004
<i>Planet Earth is slowing down</i>

1859
02:13:28,005 --> 02:13:31,255
<i>Overseas, underground</i>

1860
02:13:32,421 --> 02:13:34,380
<i>Wherever you look around</i>

1861
02:13:37,463 --> 02:13:40,630
<i>Lord, take me by the hand</i>

1862
02:13:41,255 --> 02:13:43,963
<i>Lead me through these desert sands</i>

1863
02:13:45,255 --> 02:13:48,338
<i>To the shores of a promised land</i>

1864
02:13:50,380 --> 02:13:57,129
<i>You make me cry</i>

1865
02:13:57,130 --> 02:14:01,421
<i>When you look into my eyes</i>

1866
02:14:04,463 --> 02:14:08,671
<i>And see me for who I really am</i>

1867
02:14:09,338 --> 02:14:12,005
<i>If you can't change the world</i>

1868
02:14:13,671 --> 02:14:15,420
<i>Change yourself</i>

1869
02:14:15,421 --> 02:14:19,879
<i>If you can't change the world</i>

1870
02:14:19,880 --> 02:14:21,962
<i>Change yourself</i>

1871
02:14:21,963 --> 02:14:25,005
<i>If you can't change the world</i>

1872
02:14:26,505 --> 02:14:28,420
<i>Change yourself</i>

<i>Then change your world</i>

1879
02:15:00,546 --> 02:15:03,629
<i>The world's too big</i>

1880
02:15:03,630 --> 02:15:06,795
<i>And life's too short</i>

1881
02:15:06,796 --> 02:15:08,713
<i>To be alone</i>

1882
02:15:09,880 --> 02:15:12,629
<i>To be alone</i>
