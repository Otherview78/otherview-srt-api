1
00:01:29,936 --> 00:01:31,688
Mathematicians won the war.

2
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:35,733
Mathematicians broke the Japanese codes

3
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:37,902
and built the A-bomb.

4
00:01:38,737 --> 00:01:41,115
Mathematicians, like you.

5
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:46,745
The stated goal of the Soviets is global Communism.

6
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:51,249
In medicine or economics, in technology or space

7
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,915
battle lines are being drawn.

8
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,710
To triumph, we need results, publishable, applicable results.

9
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:03,136
Now who among you will be the next Morse?

10
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,847
The next Einstein?

11
00:02:06,723 --> 00:02:09,808
Who among you will be the vanguard of democracy,

12
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:11,476
freedom and discovery?

13
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:16,691
Today, we bequeath America's future into your able hands.

14
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:20,903
Welcome to Princeton, gentlemen.

15
00:02:38,295 --> 00:02:40,546
It's not enough Hansen won the Carnegie Scholarship.

16
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,633
No, he has to have it all for himself.

17
00:02:44,092 --> 00:02:46,928
It's the first time the Carnegie Prize has been split. Hansen's all bent.

18
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:51,224
He's got his sights set on Wheeler Lab, the new military think-tank at MIT.

19
00:02:51,892 --> 00:02:53,976
They're only taking one this year.

20
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:56,062
Hansen's used to being picked first.

21
00:02:56,147 --> 00:02:57,857
Yeah, he's wasted on math.

22
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,150
He should be running for president.

23
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:12,996
There could be a mathematical explanation for how bad your tie is.

24
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:20,794
Thank you.

25
00:03:22,255 --> 00:03:24,089
Neilson, symbol cryptography.

26
00:03:24,174 --> 00:03:27,093
Neils here broke a Jap code. Helped rid the world of Fascism.

27
00:03:27,177 --> 00:03:29,888
At least that's what he tells the girls, eh, Neils?

28
00:03:30,346 --> 00:03:32,431
The name's Bender. Atomic physics.

29
00:03:32,515 --> 00:03:33,933
- And you are? - Am I late?

30
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:37,353
- Yes, Mr. Sol. - Good. Hi.

31
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:41,315
- Sol. Richard Sol. - The burden of genius.

32
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,523
- There he is. - So many supplicants, and so little time.

33
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:45,318
- Mr. Sol. - How are you, sir?

34
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:46,778
- Benden - Nice to see you.

35
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:49,197
- Congratulations, Mr. Hansen. - Thank you.

36
00:03:50,157 --> 00:03:51,616
I'll take another.

37
00:03:53,243 --> 00:03:54,327
Excuse me?

38
00:03:54,411 --> 00:03:56,454
A thousand pardons. I simply assumed you were the waiter.

39
00:03:56,538 --> 00:03:59,123
- Play nice, Hansen. - Nice is not Hansen's strong suit.

40
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,416
An honest mistake.

41
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,252
Well, Martin Hansen.

42
00:04:03,838 --> 00:04:05,046
It is Martin, isn't it?

43
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,383
Why, yes, John, it is.

44
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:10,885
I imagine you're getting quite used to miscalculation.

45
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,934
I've read your preprints, both of them.

46
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,017
The one on Nazi ciphers and the other one on nonlinear equations.

47
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:26,609
And I am supremely confident that there is not a single seminal

48
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:28,734
or innovative idea in either one of them.

49
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:33,616
Enjoy your punch.

50
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:42,581
Gentlemen, meet John Nash, the mysterious West Virginia genius.

51
00:04:43,126 --> 00:04:46,045
The other winner of the distinguished Carnegie Scholarship.

52
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:47,462
- Okay. - Yeah?

53
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:48,924
Of course.

54
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:22,331
Christ.

55
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,126
The prodigal roommate arrives.

56
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:28,878
Roommate?

57
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,214
God, no.

58
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:36,095
Did you know that having a hangover

59
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:38,553
is not having enough water in your body

60
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:40,598
to run your Krebs cycle?

61
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:44,601
Which is exactly what happens to you when you're dying of thirst.

62
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:47,979
So, dying of thirst

63
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,943
would probably feel

64
00:05:52,027 --> 00:05:56,527
pretty much like the hangover that finally bloody kills you.

65
00:05:58,449 --> 00:05:59,909
John Nash?

66
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,159
Hello.

67
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,164
Charles Herman. Pleased to meet you.

68
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,591
All right! Well done!

69
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,933
Well, it's official. I'm almost human again.

70
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:29,687
Officer, I saw the driver who hit me. His name was Johnnie Walker.

71
00:06:35,485 --> 00:06:39,698
Well, I got in last night in time for English department cocktails.

72
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:41,909
Cock was mine,

73
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:44,703
the tail belonged to a particularly lovely young thing with a passion

74
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:50,291
for D.H. Lawrence. You're not easily distracted, are you?

75
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,627
I'm here to work.

76
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,877
Are you? Right. I see. Crikey!

77
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:06,598
Is my roommate a dick?

78
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,898
Listen. If we can't break the ice,

79
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:16,733
how about we drown it?

80
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:29,038
So what's your story?

81
00:07:30,374 --> 00:07:33,124
You the poor kid that never got to go to Exeter or Andover?

82
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,337
Despite my privileged upbringing, I'm actually quite well-balanced.

83
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:38,922
I have a chip on both shoulders.

84
00:07:41,758 --> 00:07:44,719
Maybe you're just better with the old integers than you are with people.

85
00:07:45,262 --> 00:07:48,473
My first grade teacher, she told me that I was born with two helpings of brain

86
00:07:48,557 --> 00:07:50,392
but only half a helping of heart.

87
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,187
Wow! She sounds lovely!

88
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:58,733
The truth is that I don't like people much.

89
00:08:00,402 --> 00:08:01,862
And they don't much like me.

90
00:08:01,946 --> 00:08:04,448
But why, with all your obvious wit and charm?

91
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:08,869
Seriously, John.

92
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:12,121
Mathematics.

93
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:16,500
Mathematics is never going to lead you to a higher truth.

94
00:08:16,584 --> 00:08:18,210
And you know why?

95
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:21,296
Because it's boring. It's really boring.

96
00:08:22,715 --> 00:08:24,759
You know, half these schoolboys are already published?

97
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:30,305
I cannot waste time with these classes and these books.

98
00:08:33,894 --> 00:08:36,313
Memorizing the weak assumptions of lesser mortals!

99
00:08:39,608 --> 00:08:43,529
I need to look through to the governing dynamics.

100
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:49,531
Find a truly original idea.

101
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:52,493
That's the only way I'll ever distinguish myself.

102
00:08:52,577 --> 00:08:54,246
- It's the only way that I'll ever... - Matter.

103
00:08:58,334 --> 00:08:59,375
Yes.

104
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:04,422
- All right, who's next? - I've played enough Go for one day.

105
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:06,425
- Come on. - I hate this game.

106
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:08,177
Cowards, all of you!

107
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:10,344
None of you rise to meet my challenge?

108
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:14,016
Come on, Bender. Whoever wins, Sol does his laundry all semester.

109
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:16,518
- Does that seem unfair to anyone else? - Not at all.

110
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:21,565
- Look at him. - Nash!

111
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:23,109
Taking a reverse constitutional?

112
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:25,902
I'm hoping to extract an algorithm to define their movement.

113
00:09:31,448 --> 00:09:32,532
Psycho.

114
00:09:34,035 --> 00:09:36,537
Nash, I thought you dropped out. You ever going to go to class or...

115
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:39,457
Classes will dull your mind.

116
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,461
Destroy the potential for authentic creativity.

117
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,753
I didn't know that.

118
00:09:44,838 --> 00:09:47,256
Nash is going to stun us all with his genius.

119
00:09:47,883 --> 00:09:50,844
Which is another way of saying he doesn't have the nerve to compete.

120
00:09:53,012 --> 00:09:54,388
You scared?

121
00:09:54,472 --> 00:09:56,808
Terrified. Mortified. Petrified.

122
00:09:56,892 --> 00:09:57,976
Stupefied by you.

123
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:01,686
No starch.

124
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,147
Pressed and folded.

125
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:08,652
Let me ask you something, John.

126
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:10,487
Be my guest, Martin.

127
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:11,905
Bender and Sol here correctly completed

128
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,409
Allen's proof of Perron's conjecture.

129
00:10:14,492 --> 00:10:18,327
Adequate work without innovation.

130
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:21,538
- I'm flattered. You flattered? - Flattered.

131
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:25,710
And I've got two weapons briefs under security review by the DoD.

132
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:27,463
Derivative drivel.

133
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:31,967
But Nash achievements, zero.

134
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:35,428
I'm a patient man, Martin. Is there an actual question coming?

135
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,684
What if you never come up with your original idea?

136
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,480
How will it feel when I'm chosen for Wheeler and you're not?

137
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:52,361
What if you lose?

138
00:11:03,623 --> 00:11:04,708
You should not have won.

139
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,962
I had the first move, my play was perfect.

140
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:10,672
The hubris of the defeated.

141
00:11:10,756 --> 00:11:12,048
The game is flawed.

142
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:21,639
Gentlemen, the great John Nash.

143
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,649
You've been in here for two days.

144
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,655
You know Hansen has just published another paper?

145
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,324
I can't even find a topic for my doctorate.

146
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:43,621
Well, on the bright side, you've invented window art.

147
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,791
This is a group playing touch football.

148
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,794
This is a cluster of pigeons fighting over breadcrumbs.

149
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,843
And this here is a woman who is chasing a man who stole her purse.

150
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,053
John, you watched a mugging. That's weird.

151
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,599
In competitive behavior, someone always loses.

152
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:09,020
Well, my niece knows that, John, and she's about this high.

153
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:11,856
See, if I could derive an equilibrium

154
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:16,986
where prevalence is a non-singular event, where nobody loses.

155
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:21,074
Can you imagine the effect that that would have on conflict scenarios...

156
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,076
When did you last eat?

157
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,662
- When did you last eat? - Currency exchange?

158
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,289
You know, food.

159
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,752
You have no respect for cognitive reverie, you know that?

160
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:34,170
Yes. But pizza...

161
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,547
Now, pizza I have enormous respect for.

162
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,717
And, of course, beer.

163
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,476
I have respect for beer.

164
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,521
I have respect for beer!

165
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,990
- Good evening, Neils. Ladies. - Hey, Nash.

166
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,909
Who's winning? You or you?

167
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,414
- Good evening, Nash. - Hey, guys. Hey, Nash.

168
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,083
He's looking at you for sure.

169
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,791
Me?

170
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:15,876
Nash.

171
00:13:18,087 --> 00:13:21,423
Hey, Nash. Neils is trying to get your attention.

172
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:23,759
- You're joking. - No.

173
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:31,643
- Go with God. - Come back a man.

174
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:35,604
- Fortune favors the brave. - Bombs away.

175
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,735
Gentlemen, might I remind you that my odds of success

176
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,863
dramatically improve with each attempt?

177
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:55,289
This is going to be classic.

178
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:27,574
Maybe you want to buy me a drink.

179
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,245
I don't exactly know what I'm required to say

180
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:37,164
in order for you to have intercourse with me,

181
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,834
but could we assume that I've said all that?

182
00:14:41,086 --> 00:14:43,963
Essentially, we're talking about fluid exchange, right?

183
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:46,049
So, could we just go straight to the sex?

184
00:14:47,843 --> 00:14:49,301
That was sweet.

185
00:14:50,554 --> 00:14:52,764
Have a nice night, asshole!

186
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:54,599
Ladies, wait!

187
00:14:56,852 --> 00:15:01,352
I especially liked the bit about fluid exchange. it was really charming.

188
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:10,572
Walk with me, John. I've been meaning to talk with you.

189
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:15,661
The faculty is completing mid-year reviews.

190
00:15:15,744 --> 00:15:18,204
We're deciding which placement applications to support.

191
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:20,206
Wheeler, sir. That would be my first choice.

192
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,834
And, actually, I don't really have a second choice, sir.

193
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:25,128
John, your fellows have attended classes.

194
00:15:25,212 --> 00:15:27,088
They've written papers. They've published.

195
00:15:28,132 --> 00:15:30,592
- I'm still searching, sir, for my... - Your original idea.

196
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:32,011
Governing dynamics, sir.

197
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,139
It's very clever, John, but I'm afraid it's just not nearly good enough.

198
00:15:42,396 --> 00:15:43,731
- May I? - Thank you.

199
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:46,443
I've been working on manifold embedding.

200
00:15:46,526 --> 00:15:48,651
My bargaining stratagems are starting to show some promise.

201
00:15:48,736 --> 00:15:50,361
If you could just arrange another meeting,

202
00:15:50,444 --> 00:15:52,488
if you would be kind enough, with Professor Einstein.

203
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:54,072
- I've repeatedly asked you for that, sir. - Now, John...

204
00:15:54,156 --> 00:15:56,534
I'd be able to show him my revisions on his...

205
00:15:56,618 --> 00:15:57,744
John.

206
00:16:00,371 --> 00:16:01,789
Do you see what they're doing in there?

207
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:07,669
Congratulations, Professor.

208
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:09,756
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

209
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:13,177
It's the pens.

210
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,678
Reserved for a member of the department

211
00:16:14,762 --> 00:16:16,804
that makes the achievement of a lifetime.

212
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:19,516
Now what do you see, John?

213
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:22,185
Recognition.

214
00:16:23,437 --> 00:16:25,227
Well done, Professor. Well done.

215
00:16:25,771 --> 00:16:27,022
Well, try seeing accomplishment.

216
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:29,440
Is there a difference?

217
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:32,695
John, you haven't focused.

218
00:16:35,448 --> 00:16:37,031
I'm sorry,

219
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:40,285
but up to this point, your record doesn't warrant any placement at all.

220
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:45,374
Good day.

221
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:58,220
And my compliments to you, sir.

222
00:16:58,304 --> 00:16:59,471
Thank you so much.

223
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:18,697
I can't see it.

224
00:17:26,873 --> 00:17:28,624
Jesus Christ, John.

225
00:17:29,418 --> 00:17:30,836
I can't fail.

226
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:33,630
- This is all I am. - Come on, let's go out.

227
00:17:33,714 --> 00:17:35,090
I have to get something done.

228
00:17:35,173 --> 00:17:38,718
- I can't keep staring into space. - John, that's enough!

229
00:17:38,802 --> 00:17:41,762
Got to face the wall, follow their rules, read their books, do their classes.

230
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:44,515
You wanna do some damage, that's fine, but don't mess around.

231
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:48,269
Come on! Go on, bust your head! Kill yourself.

232
00:17:48,853 --> 00:17:51,273
John, do it. Don't mess around.

233
00:17:51,356 --> 00:17:55,149
Bust your head! Go on, bust that worthless head wide open.

234
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:58,277
Goddamn it, Charles! What the hell is your problem?

235
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:02,866
It's not my problem.

236
00:18:05,244 --> 00:18:06,745
And it's not your problem.

237
00:18:10,207 --> 00:18:11,541
It's their problem.

238
00:18:12,209 --> 00:18:15,045
Your answer isn't, "Face the wall."

239
00:18:16,006 --> 00:18:19,048
It's out there, where you've been working.

240
00:18:41,238 --> 00:18:42,820
That was heavy.

241
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:48,662
That Isaac Newton fellow was right.

242
00:18:48,746 --> 00:18:51,248
- He was onto something. - Clever boy.

243
00:18:51,873 --> 00:18:54,709
Don't worry, that's mine. I'll come and get it in a minute.

244
00:18:55,753 --> 00:18:56,753
Oh, God!

245
00:19:00,964 --> 00:19:02,882
Incoming, gentlemen.

246
00:19:08,223 --> 00:19:09,681
Deep breaths.

247
00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:14,435
Nash, you might want to stop shuffling your papers for five seconds.

248
00:19:19,066 --> 00:19:20,568
I will not buy you gentlemen beer.

249
00:19:20,652 --> 00:19:22,487
We're not here for beer, my friend.

250
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:30,286
Does anyone else feel she should be moving in slow motion?

251
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:33,456
Will she want a large wedding, you think?

252
00:19:33,957 --> 00:19:35,915
Shall we say swords, gentlemen? Pistols at dawn?

253
00:19:35,998 --> 00:19:38,459
Have you remembered nothing?

254
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:42,296
Recall the lessons of Adam Smith, the father of modern economics.

255
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:46,969
"In competition, individual ambition serves the common good."

256
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,387
- Exactly! - Every man for himself, gentlemen.

257
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:52,390
Those who strike out are stuck with her friends.

258
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:53,891
I'm not going to strike out.

259
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:56,519
You can lead a blond to water, but you can't make her drink.

260
00:19:57,187 --> 00:19:58,687
All right, nobody move.

261
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:01,273
She's looking over here. She's looking at Nash.

262
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:04,235
God. All right, he may have the upper hand now,

263
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,612
but wait until he opens his mouth.

264
00:20:05,696 --> 00:20:07,781
Remember the last time?

265
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:10,950
Yes. That was one for the history books.

266
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:18,414
Adam Smith needs revision.

267
00:20:18,498 --> 00:20:20,125
What are you talking about?

268
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:23,170
If we all go for the blond,

269
00:20:28,341 --> 00:20:29,634
we block each other.

270
00:20:30,302 --> 00:20:33,221
Not a single one of us is going to get her.

271
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:35,516
So then we go for her friends,

272
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:39,229
but they will all give us the cold shoulder

273
00:20:39,313 --> 00:20:41,314
because nobody likes to be second choice.

274
00:20:42,356 --> 00:20:44,983
Well, what if no one goes for the blond?

275
00:20:46,903 --> 00:20:51,281
We don't get in each other's way and we don't insult the other girls.

276
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,618
That's the only way we win.

277
00:20:57,286 --> 00:20:58,787
That's the only way we all get laid.

278
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:08,632
Adam Smith said, "The best result comes

279
00:21:09,716 --> 00:21:11,634
"from everyone in the group doing what's best for himself."

280
00:21:11,718 --> 00:21:15,805
Right? That's what he said. That's right. Incomplete. Incomplete, okay?

281
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:20,890
Because the best result will come from everyone in the group

282
00:21:22,396 --> 00:21:25,856
doing what's best for himself and the group.

283
00:21:25,941 --> 00:21:28,402
Nash, if this is some way for you to get the blond on your own,

284
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:29,567
you can go to hell.

285
00:21:29,651 --> 00:21:32,070
Governing dynamics, gentlemen. Governing dynamics.

286
00:21:32,153 --> 00:21:34,906
Adam Smith was wrong.

287
00:21:35,992 --> 00:21:38,118
- Here we go. - Careful, careful.

288
00:21:41,497 --> 00:21:42,915
Thank you.

289
00:21:54,928 --> 00:21:57,763
HCH USN HCH HT 'H

290
00:23:00,616 --> 00:23:04,078
You do realize this flies in the face of 150 years of economic theory?

291
00:23:04,162 --> 00:23:05,328
Yes, I do, sir.

292
00:23:05,412 --> 00:23:06,747
That's rather presumptuous, don't you think?

293
00:23:06,831 --> 00:23:07,997
It is, sir.

294
00:23:15,924 --> 00:23:19,844
Well, Mr. Nash, with a breakthrough of this magnitude,

295
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:23,554
I'm confident you will get any placement you like.

296
00:23:30,937 --> 00:23:35,438
Wheeler Labs, they'll ask you to recommend two team members.

297
00:23:40,365 --> 00:23:42,115
Stills and Frank are excellent choices.

298
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:43,950
Sol and Bender, sir.

299
00:23:44,492 --> 00:23:47,286
Sol and Bender are extraordinary mathematicians.

300
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:49,205
Has it occurred to you, Mr. Nash,

301
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:51,208
that Sol and Bender might have plans of their own?

302
00:23:57,006 --> 00:23:58,131
We made it!

303
00:23:58,215 --> 00:24:00,176
Wheeler, we made it!

304
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:02,635
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

305
00:24:05,012 --> 00:24:07,222
Okay, awkward moment, gentlemen.

306
00:24:32,082 --> 00:24:33,374
Governing dynamics.

307
00:24:37,045 --> 00:24:38,296
Congratulations, John.

308
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:41,380
- Toast! To Wheeler Labs! - To Wheeler!

309
00:25:06,323 --> 00:25:09,034
General, the analyst from Wheeler Lab is here.

310
00:25:09,118 --> 00:25:10,869
Dr. Nash, your coat?

311
00:25:10,954 --> 00:25:12,454
Thank you, sir.

312
00:25:12,956 --> 00:25:14,164
Doctor.

313
00:25:14,248 --> 00:25:16,541
General, this is Wheeler team leader, Dr. John Nash.

314
00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:18,876
Glad you could come, Doctor.

315
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
Hello.

316
00:25:20,626 --> 00:25:21,629
Right this way.

317
00:25:22,504 --> 00:25:25,799
We've been intercepting radio transmissions from Moscow.

318
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:30,012
The computer can't detect a pattern, but I'm sure it's code.

319
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,472
Why is that, General?

320
00:25:33,391 --> 00:25:35,308
Ever just know something, Dr. Nash?

321
00:25:38,272 --> 00:25:39,480
Constantly.

322
00:25:42,025 --> 00:25:44,111
We've developed several ciphers.

323
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:48,322
If you'd like to review our preliminary data?

324
00:25:50,576 --> 00:25:51,576
Doctor?

325
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:55,705
6-7-3-7. 0-3-6...

326
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,371
8-4-9-4.

327
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,582
9- 1 -4-0-3-4.

328
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:42,833
0-3-4.

329
00:27:00,394 --> 00:27:01,894
I need a map.

330
00:27:04,564 --> 00:27:08,610
46-13-08, 67-46-90.

331
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:12,570
Starkey Corners, Maine.

332
00:27:14,073 --> 00:27:18,571
48-03-01. 91-26-35.

333
00:27:19,995 --> 00:27:22,080
Prairie Portage, Minnesota.

334
00:27:22,164 --> 00:27:24,249
These are latitudes and longitudes.

335
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:26,418
There are at least 10 others.

336
00:27:26,502 --> 00:27:28,921
They appear to be routing orders across the border into the US.

337
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:32,715
Extraordinary.

338
00:27:33,633 --> 00:27:36,427
Gentlemen, we need to move on this.

339
00:27:38,764 --> 00:27:40,348
Who's Big Brother?

340
00:27:40,433 --> 00:27:42,810
You've done your country a great service, son.

341
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,105
- Captain! - Yes, sir.

342
00:27:46,522 --> 00:27:48,440
Accompany Dr. Nash.

343
00:27:48,941 --> 00:27:50,272
What are the Russians moving, General?

344
00:27:52,276 --> 00:27:55,445
Captain Rogers will escort you to the unrestricted area, Doctor.

345
00:27:55,572 --> 00:27:56,906
Thank you.

346
00:27:57,573 --> 00:27:59,074
Dr. Nash, follow me, please.

347
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:09,835
None of those who have said they don't like the method

348
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,299
have told us any other method they could use that would be effective.

349
00:28:15,008 --> 00:28:16,552
- It's Dr. Nash. - All right.

350
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,732
- Thank you, sir. - Home run at the Pentagon?

351
00:28:33,816 --> 00:28:36,693
Have they actually taken the word "classified" out of the dictionary?

352
00:28:37,613 --> 00:28:40,198
Hi. The air conditioning broke again.

353
00:28:40,282 --> 00:28:42,826
How am I supposed to be in here saving the world if I'm melting?

354
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:44,662
Our hearts go out to you, John.

355
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,456
You know, two trips to the Pentagon in four years.

356
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:51,209
- That's two more than we've had. - it gets better, John.

357
00:28:51,293 --> 00:28:53,253
Just got our latest scintillating assignment.

358
00:28:54,213 --> 00:28:56,006
You know, the Russians have the H-bomb,

359
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:58,593
the Nazis are repatriating South America,

360
00:28:58,677 --> 00:29:01,053
the Chinese have a standing army of 2.8 million,

361
00:29:01,805 --> 00:29:04,516
and I am doing stress tests on a dam.

362
00:29:05,266 --> 00:29:07,725
Look, you made the cover of Fortune again.

363
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:09,936
Please note the use of the word "you," not "we."

364
00:29:11,645 --> 00:29:13,147
That was supposed to be just me.

365
00:29:17,151 --> 00:29:18,860
Not only do they rob me of the Fields Medal,

366
00:29:18,944 --> 00:29:22,239
now they put me on the cover of Fortune magazine with these hacks,

367
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:23,656
these scholars of trivia.

368
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:27,162
John, exactly what is the difference between genius and most genius?

369
00:29:28,998 --> 00:29:30,165
Quite a lot.

370
00:29:30,873 --> 00:29:31,916
He's your son.

371
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:33,292
Anyway, you've got 10 minutes.

372
00:29:34,043 --> 00:29:35,627
I've always got 10 minutes.

373
00:29:35,712 --> 00:29:36,963
Before your new class?

374
00:29:43,638 --> 00:29:45,511
Can I not get a note from a doctor or something?

375
00:29:46,848 --> 00:29:49,139
You are a doctor, John, and no.

376
00:29:49,808 --> 00:29:52,727
Come on. You know the drill, we get these beautiful facilities...

377
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:54,687
MIT gets America's great minds of today

378
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,481
teaching America's great minds of tomorrow.

379
00:29:56,565 --> 00:29:57,983
Poor bastards.

380
00:29:58,066 --> 00:29:59,984
Now, have a nice day at school.

381
00:30:00,068 --> 00:30:01,278
The bell is ringing.

382
00:30:23,549 --> 00:30:25,969
The eager young minds of tomorrow.

383
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,939
Can we leave one open, Professor? It's really hot, sir.

384
00:30:41,234 --> 00:30:45,656
Your comfort comes second to my ability to hear my own voice.

385
00:30:50,701 --> 00:30:55,202
Personally, I think this class will be a waste of your,

386
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:58,668
and what is infinitely worse,

387
00:31:00,088 --> 00:31:01,669
my time.

388
00:31:03,297 --> 00:31:06,424
However, here we are.

389
00:31:07,467 --> 00:31:09,469
So, you may attend or not.

390
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,347
You may complete your assignments at your whim.

391
00:31:12,848 --> 00:31:14,349
We have begun.

392
00:31:17,312 --> 00:31:18,437
Miss.

393
00:31:21,648 --> 00:31:22,983
Excuse me!

394
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:25,819
- Excuse me! - Hey, hey!

395
00:31:26,362 --> 00:31:27,404
Hi!

396
00:31:29,491 --> 00:31:31,075
We have a little problem.

397
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:33,703
It's extremely hot in here with the windows closed

398
00:31:33,787 --> 00:31:36,455
and extremely noisy with them open.

399
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:38,871
So I was wondering if there was any way you could,

400
00:31:38,955 --> 00:31:42,585
I don't know, maybe work someplace else for about 45 minutes?

401
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:45,546
- Not a problem. - Thank you so much!

402
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,173
- Break! - Got it!

403
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:50,342
Let's go. Clean it up a little bit.

404
00:31:52,469 --> 00:31:55,346
As you will find in multivariable calculus, there is often

405
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:59,186
a number of solutions for any given problem.

406
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,316
As I was saying, this problem here

407
00:32:06,693 --> 00:32:08,986
will take some of you many months to solve.

408
00:32:09,946 --> 00:32:11,864
For others among you,

409
00:32:13,075 --> 00:32:15,869
it will take you the term of your natural lives.

410
00:32:30,132 --> 00:32:32,175
Professor Nash.

411
00:32:44,981 --> 00:32:46,564
William Parcher.

412
00:32:47,358 --> 00:32:48,442
Big Brother,

413
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:51,986
at your service.

414
00:32:52,362 --> 00:32:55,281
What can I do for the Department of Defense?

415
00:32:55,365 --> 00:32:56,615
Are you here to give me a raise?

416
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,410
Let's take a walk.

417
00:32:59,785 --> 00:33:02,955
- Impressive work at the Pentagon. - Yes, it was.

418
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:06,792
Oppenheimer used to say, "Genius sees the answer before the question."

419
00:33:06,876 --> 00:33:08,794
You knew Oppenheimer?

420
00:33:08,878 --> 00:33:11,755
His project was under my supervision.

421
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:13,341
Which project?

422
00:33:16,386 --> 00:33:19,013
- That project. - it's not that simple, you know?

423
00:33:19,306 --> 00:33:20,725
Well, you ended the war.

424
00:33:20,934 --> 00:33:24,352
We incinerated 150,000 people in a heartbeat.

425
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:27,272
Great deeds come at great cost, Mr. Parcher.

426
00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:33,064
Conviction, it turns out, is a luxury of those on the sidelines, Mr. Nash.

427
00:33:35,988 --> 00:33:38,280
I'll try and keep that in mind.

428
00:33:40,992 --> 00:33:43,328
So, John, no family,

429
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:46,207
no close friends.

430
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,457
Why is that?

431
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:50,211
I like to think it's because I'm a lone wolf.

432
00:33:51,254 --> 00:33:54,215
But mainly it's because people don't like me.

433
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,759
Well, there are certain endeavors

434
00:33:56,842 --> 00:34:00,637
where your lack of personal connection would be considered an advantage.

435
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:06,269
- This is a secure area. - They know me.

436
00:34:09,273 --> 00:34:10,356
Have you ever been here?

437
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:14,107
We were told during our initial briefing that these warehouses were abandoned.

438
00:34:14,191 --> 00:34:16,444
That's not precisely accurate.

439
00:34:54,064 --> 00:34:55,355
By telling you what I'm about to tell you,

440
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,986
I am increasing your security clearance to top secret.

441
00:34:59,069 --> 00:35:03,115
Disclosure of secure information can result in imprisonment.

442
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,240
Get it?

443
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,369
What operation?

444
00:35:12,207 --> 00:35:14,043
Those are a good idea.

445
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,467
This factory is in Berlin. We seized it at the end of the war.

446
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:25,889
Nazi engineers were attempting to build a portable atomic bomb.

447
00:35:26,014 --> 00:35:29,556
The Soviets reached this facility before we did, and we lost the damn thing.

448
00:35:32,727 --> 00:35:37,022
The routing orders at the Pentagon. They were about this, weren't they?

449
00:35:38,482 --> 00:35:40,985
The Soviets aren't as unified as people believe.

450
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:44,655
A faction of the Red Army calling itself Novaya Svoboda,

451
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,782
the "New Freedom," has control of the bomb

452
00:35:46,866 --> 00:35:49,744
and intends to detonate it on U.S. soil.

453
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:53,165
Their plan is to incur maximum civilian casualties.

454
00:35:58,211 --> 00:36:01,966
Man is capable of as much atrocity as he has imagination.

455
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:07,178
New Freedom has sleeper agents here in the U.S.

456
00:36:08,844 --> 00:36:12,515
McCarthy is an idiot, but, unfortunately, that doesn't make him wrong.

457
00:36:14,185 --> 00:36:16,352
New Freedom communicates to its agents

458
00:36:16,436 --> 00:36:19,523
through codes embedded in newspapers and magazines,

459
00:36:19,607 --> 00:36:20,648
and that's where you come in.

460
00:36:21,442 --> 00:36:24,903
You see, John, what distinguishes you

461
00:36:25,737 --> 00:36:28,448
is that you are, quite simply,

462
00:36:28,991 --> 00:36:32,786
the best natural code-breaker I have ever seen.

463
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,587
What exactly is it that you would like me to do?

464
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:49,469
Commit this list of periodicals to memory.

465
00:36:51,012 --> 00:36:55,511
Scan each new issue, find any hidden codes, decipher them.

466
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,478
Place your chin on the chin rest.

467
00:37:00,563 --> 00:37:03,985
- Stare into the light. - Pulse 88, regular.

468
00:37:07,237 --> 00:37:09,365
Okay, this may be a little uncomfortable.

469
00:37:11,824 --> 00:37:15,036
It's got a little zap to it, doesn't it?

470
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,914
He just implanted a radium diode.

471
00:37:17,998 --> 00:37:19,666
Don't worry, it's safe.

472
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:22,624
The isotope decays predictably.

473
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:25,670
As a result, these numbers change over time.

474
00:37:26,255 --> 00:37:29,174
They're the access codes to your drop spot.

475
00:37:30,843 --> 00:37:33,929
So what am I now, a spy?

476
00:37:46,942 --> 00:37:48,026
Come.

477
00:37:52,364 --> 00:37:54,784
Boy, you must be really important.

478
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:04,876
It's all right, Mike.

479
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:15,595
What are you working on?

480
00:38:18,306 --> 00:38:19,598
Classified.

481
00:38:21,351 --> 00:38:24,103
- Everyone waited half an hour. - For?

482
00:38:25,315 --> 00:38:26,439
Class.

483
00:38:27,023 --> 00:38:28,899
You missed class today.

484
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:31,736
Well, I suspect that

485
00:38:33,906 --> 00:38:35,657
nobody missed me.

486
00:38:36,241 --> 00:38:38,659
The problem that you left on the board...

487
00:38:40,286 --> 00:38:41,410
I solved it.

488
00:38:42,913 --> 00:38:44,164
No, you didn't.

489
00:38:44,373 --> 00:38:45,582
You didn't even look.

490
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:49,545
I never said that the vector fields were rational functions.

491
00:38:54,425 --> 00:38:56,259
Your solution is elegant.

492
00:38:58,762 --> 00:39:01,390
Though on this particular occasion

493
00:39:02,475 --> 00:39:04,268
ultimately incorrect.

494
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:27,164
You're still here.

495
00:39:27,456 --> 00:39:28,999
I'm still here.

496
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:31,461
Why?

497
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:35,464
I'm wondering, Professor Nash,

498
00:39:36,884 --> 00:39:38,678
if I can ask you to dinner.

499
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,933
You do eat, don't you?

500
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,060
On occasion, yeah.

501
00:39:47,979 --> 00:39:50,188
Table for one. Prometheus alone, chained to the rock

502
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,524
with the bird circling overhead, you know how it is.

503
00:39:55,985 --> 00:39:58,194
No, I expect that you wouldn't know.

504
00:40:02,073 --> 00:40:04,493
Leave your address with my office.

505
00:40:04,577 --> 00:40:09,077
I'll pick you up Friday at 8:00 and we'll eat.

506
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:22,090
One more thing. Do you have a name, or should I just keep calling you "miss"?

507
00:40:25,807 --> 00:40:27,434
Governor, may I present...

508
00:40:27,518 --> 00:40:29,601
- Miss Alicia Larde. - Miss Alicia Larde.

509
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:33,271
Professor, please. You and the governor.

510
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,149
Wait, one second. I'm sorry.

511
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:42,573
I want a copy of this. First big date and all, you know.

512
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:45,699
So, you boys need to look good,

513
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:51,410
which is not a state you find yourselves in altogether naturally.

514
00:40:55,002 --> 00:40:57,462
There. Better.

515
00:40:58,713 --> 00:41:00,047
I'm surprising him.

516
00:41:00,131 --> 00:41:03,050
You just keep on surprising him. Professor.

517
00:41:20,567 --> 00:41:22,777
God must be a painter.

518
00:41:23,529 --> 00:41:26,158
Why else would we have so many colors?

519
00:41:28,743 --> 00:41:30,493
So you're a painter?

520
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:34,080
That's not actually what I said,

521
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:38,419
but, yes, I am.

522
00:41:47,884 --> 00:41:48,969
Here.

523
00:41:50,429 --> 00:41:52,974
Me. Your date.

524
00:41:55,602 --> 00:41:59,062
Practice human interaction and social comportment.

525
00:41:59,147 --> 00:42:00,774
That's a plan.

526
00:42:03,694 --> 00:42:05,737
Champagne would be lovely.

527
00:42:07,906 --> 00:42:09,490
I'll be outside.

528
00:42:10,116 --> 00:42:12,119
I will get the champagne.

529
00:42:20,711 --> 00:42:22,212
Thank you.

530
00:42:23,672 --> 00:42:25,091
Thank you for that.

531
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:27,215
No, keep it.

532
00:42:27,299 --> 00:42:30,093
I believe in deciding things will be good luck.

533
00:42:31,178 --> 00:42:33,472
- Do you? - No.

534
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:36,726
I don't believe in luck.

535
00:42:41,064 --> 00:42:43,649
But I do believe in assigning value to things.

536
00:42:54,327 --> 00:42:56,663
I once tried to count them all.

537
00:42:57,915 --> 00:43:02,002
I actually made it to 4,348.

538
00:43:04,168 --> 00:43:05,878
You are exceptionally odd.

539
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:09,382
I bet you're very popular with the girls.

540
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:17,306
A pair of odd ducks, then.

541
00:43:22,979 --> 00:43:24,439
Pick a shape.

542
00:43:26,526 --> 00:43:27,610
What?

543
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:31,445
Pick a shape, an animal, anything.

544
00:43:33,698 --> 00:43:35,032
Okay.

545
00:43:36,284 --> 00:43:37,702
An umbrella.

546
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,074
Do it again.

547
00:44:18,285 --> 00:44:19,327
Do it again.

548
00:44:19,494 --> 00:44:23,370
- All right. What would you like? - Do an octopus.

549
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,542
You don't talk much, do you?

550
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:19,460
I can't talk to you about my work, Alicia.

551
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,921
I don't mean work.

552
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,678
I find that polishing my interactions

553
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:32,474
in order to make them sociable requires a tremendous effort.

554
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:37,102
I have a tendency to expedite information flow

555
00:47:38,896 --> 00:47:40,606
by being direct.

556
00:47:42,233 --> 00:47:44,444
I often don't get a pleasant result.

557
00:47:44,652 --> 00:47:45,903
Try me.

558
00:47:47,697 --> 00:47:48,781
All right.

559
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,246
I find you attractive.

560
00:47:56,456 --> 00:48:00,001
Your aggressive moves towards me indicate that you feel the same way.

561
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:05,460
But still, ritual requires that we continue with a number of platonic activities

562
00:48:05,964 --> 00:48:08,092
before we have sex.

563
00:48:08,715 --> 00:48:11,428
I am proceeding with those activities,

564
00:48:11,512 --> 00:48:13,513
but in point of actual fact,

565
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:18,142
all I really want to do is have intercourse with you as soon as possible.

566
00:48:19,977 --> 00:48:22,145
Are you going to slap me now?

567
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:48,590
How was that result?

568
00:49:05,857 --> 00:49:07,566
What are you doing?

569
00:49:12,071 --> 00:49:14,115
I'm attempting to isolate patterned reoccurrences

570
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:17,368
within periodicals over time. And you?

571
00:49:17,536 --> 00:49:19,663
You talk funny, Mr. Nash.

572
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:25,917
Do I know you?

573
00:49:26,001 --> 00:49:28,212
My uncle says you're very smart

574
00:49:28,337 --> 00:49:29,754
but not very nice,

575
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,215
so I shouldn't pay no mind if you're mean to me.

576
00:49:32,299 --> 00:49:34,135
And who might your uncle be?

577
00:49:34,218 --> 00:49:35,552
The prodigal roommate

578
00:49:37,053 --> 00:49:38,554
returns.

579
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,727
- Come here! - Charles, Charles.

580
00:49:50,401 --> 00:49:54,153
My sister got herself killed in a car crash.

581
00:49:55,572 --> 00:49:57,408
Not too far now, Marcee!

582
00:49:58,075 --> 00:50:02,574
Her cowboy husband was too drunk to know that he was too drunk to drive.

583
00:50:02,746 --> 00:50:04,831
So, I took her in.

584
00:50:06,414 --> 00:50:07,666
She's so small.

585
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,753
Well, she's young, John. That's how they come.

586
00:50:12,505 --> 00:50:17,006
I'm at Harvard doing the great author's workshop.

587
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,053
D.H. bloody Lawrence.

588
00:50:19,347 --> 00:50:22,432
I really do think you should buy yourself a new book.

589
00:50:24,308 --> 00:50:27,061
Well, I've been reading a lot about you.

590
00:50:28,104 --> 00:50:29,772
How are you, John?

591
00:50:30,565 --> 00:50:32,525
At first, all my work here was trivial,

592
00:50:32,609 --> 00:50:35,320
but a new assignment came up and...

593
00:50:36,863 --> 00:50:38,781
I can't really tell you any details.

594
00:50:38,866 --> 00:50:41,533
Top secret? Black bag? Black ops?

595
00:50:41,617 --> 00:50:43,409
Something like that.

596
00:50:43,744 --> 00:50:46,538
- And. .. - Yes?

597
00:50:47,665 --> 00:50:49,333
Well, I met a girl.

598
00:50:49,833 --> 00:50:51,793
- No! A human girl? - Homo sapien.

599
00:50:51,877 --> 00:50:54,212
- A biped? - Yep. And contrary to all probabilities,

600
00:50:54,296 --> 00:50:57,965
she finds me attractive on a number of different levels.

601
00:50:58,049 --> 00:51:00,010
God, that's wonderful.

602
00:51:00,802 --> 00:51:03,639
Well, there's no accounting for taste, is there?

603
00:51:06,684 --> 00:51:09,477
- Should I marry her? - God. Right.

604
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:15,234
I mean, everything's going well. The job is fine. I have enough money.

605
00:51:15,318 --> 00:51:17,235
It all seems to add up.

606
00:51:18,488 --> 00:51:20,153
But how do you know for sure?

607
00:51:22,448 --> 00:51:24,657
Nothing's ever for sure, John.

608
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,661
That's the only sure thing I do know.

609
00:51:35,128 --> 00:51:36,421
Good evening.

610
00:51:43,094 --> 00:51:46,890
Alicia, please don't be angry. I just lost track of time at work,

611
00:51:48,517 --> 00:51:49,809
again.

612
00:51:51,561 --> 00:51:52,897
I'm sorry.

613
00:51:53,563 --> 00:51:55,691
I didn't have time to wrap it.

614
00:51:56,733 --> 00:51:58,275
Happy birthday.

615
00:52:02,696 --> 00:52:04,447
The refractive faces of the glass,

616
00:52:04,531 --> 00:52:06,367
you see, they create a full wavelength dispersal,

617
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:09,118
- so if you look inside it, you can see... - Every possible color.

618
00:52:09,202 --> 00:52:12,663
Every possible color. Yeah.

619
00:52:12,748 --> 00:52:14,373
Remember you said that time, "God must be a painter

620
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:16,668
"because of all the colors"?

621
00:52:16,752 --> 00:52:19,004
At the governor's house, you said that.

622
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:22,258
I didn't think you were listening.

623
00:52:25,052 --> 00:52:26,803
I was listening.

624
00:52:33,394 --> 00:52:35,144
It's beautiful.

625
00:52:51,704 --> 00:52:54,455
Alicia, does our relationship warrant long-term commitment?

626
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:59,039
Because I need some kind of proof, some kind of verifiable, empirical data.

627
00:53:04,925 --> 00:53:07,427
I'm sorry, just give me a moment

628
00:53:08,971 --> 00:53:12,181
to redefine my girlish notions of romance.

629
00:53:15,767 --> 00:53:17,019
A Proof?

630
00:53:17,686 --> 00:53:19,270
Verifiable data.

631
00:53:20,981 --> 00:53:22,107
Okay.

632
00:53:24,026 --> 00:53:27,278
Well, how big is the universe?

633
00:53:27,947 --> 00:53:29,198
Infinite.

634
00:53:29,448 --> 00:53:30,992
How do you know?

635
00:53:31,075 --> 00:53:32,533
I know because all the data indicates it's infinite.

636
00:53:32,617 --> 00:53:33,911
- But it hasn't been proven yet? - No.

637
00:53:33,995 --> 00:53:35,036
- You haven't seen it. - No.

638
00:53:35,121 --> 00:53:36,289
How do you know for sure?

639
00:53:37,707 --> 00:53:39,209
I don't, I just believe it.

640
00:53:42,712 --> 00:53:44,672
It's the same with love, I guess.

641
00:53:52,594 --> 00:53:56,140
Now, the part that you don't know

642
00:53:58,475 --> 00:54:00,978
is if I want to marry you.

643
00:54:22,001 --> 00:54:23,835
Smile for the camera!

644
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:28,964
Well done!

645
00:54:31,049 --> 00:54:32,550
Congratulations.

646
00:54:34,887 --> 00:54:36,638
You look beautiful.

647
00:54:37,848 --> 00:54:39,182
Hi, how are you?

648
00:54:46,064 --> 00:54:48,024
- Bye-bye. - Bye, now.

649
00:54:48,275 --> 00:54:50,528
- Bye! - Bye!

650
00:54:50,612 --> 00:54:51,695
Be safe!

651
00:55:21,391 --> 00:55:22,891
Get in. Hurry.

652
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,563
They're following us.

653
00:55:32,903 --> 00:55:34,446
Who is... Who is following us?

654
00:55:34,696 --> 00:55:36,155
The drop has been compromised.

655
00:55:37,032 --> 00:55:38,283
Get down!

656
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:40,369
Stay down.

657
00:56:08,772 --> 00:56:10,981
- Here, take this. - I ain't shooting anybody.

658
00:56:11,065 --> 00:56:13,983
- Take the goddamn gun! - No!

659
00:56:32,544 --> 00:56:34,254
You stay back. Don't move.

660
00:57:21,675 --> 00:57:22,760
John?

661
00:57:30,017 --> 00:57:31,184
Hi.

662
00:57:34,064 --> 00:57:35,397
Where were you?

663
00:57:38,692 --> 00:57:41,443
- Sol... - Yeah, I talked to Sol.

664
00:57:41,527 --> 00:57:44,153
He said you left the office hours ago.

665
00:57:47,075 --> 00:57:48,993
Why didn't you call me?

666
00:57:53,832 --> 00:57:55,165
Are you all right?

667
00:58:04,551 --> 00:58:06,052
Honey?

668
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:09,139
John.

669
00:58:09,807 --> 00:58:12,434
Please, talk to me. Tell me what happened.

670
00:58:13,811 --> 00:58:15,688
John, open the door.

671
00:58:17,603 --> 00:58:20,106
Come on, open the door! Let me in!

672
00:58:20,691 --> 00:58:22,067
Talk to me!

673
00:58:23,777 --> 00:58:24,944
John!

674
00:58:26,072 --> 00:58:27,573
Open this door!

675
00:58:44,965 --> 00:58:46,759
Watch for cars, kids.

676
00:59:08,363 --> 00:59:09,447
What was that?

677
00:59:29,052 --> 00:59:30,302
John.

678
00:59:31,803 --> 00:59:32,929
William.

679
00:59:33,638 --> 00:59:36,221
This is not what I signed up for.

680
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:38,100
Every time a car backfires or a door slams...

681
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:41,937
I understand better than you could possibly imagine.

682
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,865
You need to calm down, John.

683
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:57,119
Now listen to me. We're closing in on the bomb,

684
00:59:57,204 --> 00:59:59,331
in large part due to your work.

685
00:59:59,414 --> 01:00:02,082
Now don't you think your fear is a small price to pay?

686
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:05,335
William, my circumstance has changed.

687
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,379
Alicia's pregnant.

688
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:18,639
I told you attachments were dangerous.

689
01:00:19,099 --> 01:00:21,226
You chose to marry the girl.

690
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,187
I did nothing to prevent it.

691
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:29,859
The best way to ensure everybody's safety

692
01:00:29,943 --> 01:00:31,903
is for you to continue your work.

693
01:00:33,195 --> 01:00:34,572
Well, I'll just quit.

694
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:36,407
You won't.

695
01:00:36,826 --> 01:00:37,951
Why would I not?

696
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:41,038
Because I keep the Russians from knowing you work for us.

697
01:00:41,913 --> 01:00:43,957
You quit working for me,

698
01:00:44,542 --> 01:00:46,584
I quit working for you.

699
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:02,348
Parcher! Parcher!

700
01:01:07,229 --> 01:01:09,023
John, you all right?

701
01:01:30,127 --> 01:01:31,294
John?

702
01:01:31,378 --> 01:01:33,088
Turn it off! Turn off the light!

703
01:01:36,883 --> 01:01:40,262
Why would you do that? Why would you turn the light on?

704
01:01:40,345 --> 01:01:41,846
What is wrong with you?

705
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:44,056
You have to go to your sister's.

706
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:45,934
I left the car at the back.

707
01:01:46,018 --> 01:01:48,020
Now you can take Commonwealth, no side streets.

708
01:01:48,103 --> 01:01:49,437
- John. .. - Stay where it's crowded.

709
01:01:49,521 --> 01:01:51,355
John, I'm not going anywhere!

710
01:01:51,439 --> 01:01:53,316
When you get to your sister's, you wait for me to call.

711
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,359
No, I'm not going.

712
01:01:54,443 --> 01:01:55,777
- Just get your things. - I'm not leaving!

713
01:01:55,861 --> 01:01:57,362
Stop! Stop it.

714
01:01:58,281 --> 01:01:59,782
Please, Alicia.

715
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:04,120
I'll explain when I can.

716
01:02:50,663 --> 01:02:54,167
Uncle John! Uncle John!

717
01:02:56,544 --> 01:02:59,338
Hey, baby girl!

718
01:03:00,633 --> 01:03:02,675
Wow, someone needed a hug.

719
01:03:03,885 --> 01:03:05,761
I saw you on the slate, and I thought to myself,

720
01:03:05,845 --> 01:03:09,516
"How can I miss seeing a guest lecture by the inimitable John Nash?"

721
01:03:13,396 --> 01:03:14,855
What's wrong?

722
01:03:17,525 --> 01:03:20,444
I got myself into something. I think I might need some help.

723
01:03:20,611 --> 01:03:22,359
Well, now you tell me, what is it?

724
01:03:22,862 --> 01:03:24,404
Professor Nash!

725
01:03:25,154 --> 01:03:26,531
Welcome!

726
01:03:28,535 --> 01:03:29,826
After?

727
01:03:36,542 --> 01:03:41,043
So, we see that the zeros of the Riemann zeta function

728
01:03:43,591 --> 01:03:48,091
correspond to singularities in space-time.

729
01:03:48,929 --> 01:03:51,806
Singularities in space-time then...

730
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,440
And conventional number theory...

731
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,360
It breaks down in the face of relativistic exploration.

732
01:04:19,752 --> 01:04:23,713
Sometimes our expectations are betrayed by the numbers.

733
01:04:24,923 --> 01:04:29,423
Variables are impossible to assign any rational value.

734
01:04:49,696 --> 01:04:50,780
Professor Nash!

735
01:05:01,835 --> 01:05:03,878
- Hold it! - Professor Nash?

736
01:05:06,297 --> 01:05:10,797
Professor Nash, let's avoid a scene, shall we?

737
01:05:12,805 --> 01:05:14,056
What do you want?

738
01:05:14,806 --> 01:05:16,640
My name is Rosen.

739
01:05:16,723 --> 01:05:18,809
Dr. Rosen. I'm a psychiatrist.

740
01:05:19,018 --> 01:05:22,020
Forgive me if I don't seem persuaded.

741
01:05:22,104 --> 01:05:24,606
I'd like you to come with me, John.

742
01:05:26,024 --> 01:05:27,650
Just for a chat.

743
01:05:28,985 --> 01:05:30,821
It appears I have no choice.

744
01:05:42,332 --> 01:05:44,001
Help me! Somebody!

745
01:05:48,881 --> 01:05:50,508
Somebody! Help me!

746
01:05:51,091 --> 01:05:52,843
Get off me!

747
01:05:53,177 --> 01:05:55,178
I know who you are! I know who you are!

748
01:05:55,262 --> 01:05:57,178
- No, no, no, don't! - Charles!

749
01:05:57,345 --> 01:05:59,181
Charles, they're Russians! Charles, they're Russians!

750
01:05:59,265 --> 01:06:01,017
Call somebody! Call somebody, Charles!

751
01:06:01,101 --> 01:06:02,602
- They're Russians! - Steady the leg.

752
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,312
Get away from me.

753
01:06:04,687 --> 01:06:06,354
Stay away from me!

754
01:06:11,819 --> 01:06:13,196
There, now.

755
01:06:14,739 --> 01:06:16,073
All better.

756
01:06:19,828 --> 01:06:21,870
Everything's all right here.

757
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:25,874
Watch your head.

758
01:06:54,737 --> 01:06:57,239
John? John?

759
01:06:59,241 --> 01:07:00,909
Can you hear me?

760
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:16,966
Go easy now.

761
01:07:17,342 --> 01:07:20,261
Thorazine takes a little while to wear off.

762
01:07:23,222 --> 01:07:25,516
Sorry about the restraints.

763
01:07:25,724 --> 01:07:28,101
But you've got one hell of a right hook.

764
01:07:29,729 --> 01:07:31,106
Where am I?

765
01:07:33,274 --> 01:07:35,442
MacArthur Psychiatric Hospital.

766
01:07:38,238 --> 01:07:40,114
I find that highly unlikely.

767
01:07:41,449 --> 01:07:42,908
You made a mistake.

768
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:46,912
My work is non-military in application.

769
01:07:47,539 --> 01:07:49,540
Which work is that, John?

770
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:53,375
I don't know anything.

771
01:07:54,044 --> 01:07:56,546
There's no good in keeping secrets, you know.

772
01:08:12,396 --> 01:08:13,481
Charles?

773
01:08:15,941 --> 01:08:17,317
Charles?

774
01:08:19,404 --> 01:08:21,239
I didn't mean to get you involved in this.

775
01:08:22,949 --> 01:08:24,407
I'm... I'm sorry.

776
01:08:29,996 --> 01:08:31,038
Charles?

777
01:08:39,338 --> 01:08:40,714
The prodigal roommate revealed.

778
01:08:44,343 --> 01:08:47,221
"Saw my name on the lecture slate"?

779
01:08:47,306 --> 01:08:48,931
You lying son of a bitch!

780
01:08:49,516 --> 01:08:51,559
Who are you talking to? Tell me who you see.

781
01:08:52,311 --> 01:08:54,186
How do you say "Charles Herman" in Russian?

782
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:55,647
How do you say it in Russian?

783
01:08:57,190 --> 01:08:58,273
There's no one there, John.

784
01:08:59,191 --> 01:09:00,318
There's no one there.

785
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:03,113
He's right there. He's right there.

786
01:09:04,532 --> 01:09:08,865
Stop! I don't know anything! Stop! I don't know anything!

787
01:09:11,077 --> 01:09:14,872
My name is John Nash. I'm being held against my will.

788
01:09:14,956 --> 01:09:17,541
Somebody call the Department of Defense.

789
01:09:17,626 --> 01:09:21,548
My name is John Nash. I'm being held against my will!

790
01:09:26,886 --> 01:09:28,762
What's wrong with him?

791
01:09:31,974 --> 01:09:33,892
John has schizophrenia.

792
01:09:35,353 --> 01:09:38,231
People with this disorder are often paranoid.

793
01:09:40,273 --> 01:09:42,817
But... But his work.

794
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:45,402
He deals with conspiracy. So...

795
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:48,740
Yes. Yes, I know.

796
01:09:49,783 --> 01:09:54,162
In John's world, these behaviors are accepted, encouraged.

797
01:09:55,412 --> 01:09:58,457
As such, his illness may have gone untreated

798
01:09:58,541 --> 01:10:00,752
far longer than is typical.

799
01:10:01,461 --> 01:10:02,836
What do you mean? How long?

800
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,756
Possibly since graduate school.

801
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:08,468
At least that's when his hallucinations seem to have begun.

802
01:10:08,551 --> 01:10:10,678
What are you talking about? What hallucinations?

803
01:10:10,762 --> 01:10:13,514
One, so far, that I am aware of.

804
01:10:13,598 --> 01:10:16,892
An imaginary roommate named Charles Herman.

805
01:10:18,688 --> 01:10:20,440
Charles isn't imaginary.

806
01:10:20,523 --> 01:10:22,522
He and John have been best friends since Princeton.

807
01:10:22,605 --> 01:10:26,109
Have you ever met Charles? Has he ever come to dinner?

808
01:10:26,193 --> 01:10:28,945
He's always in town for so little time, lecturing.

809
01:10:29,029 --> 01:10:31,405
- Was he at your wedding? - He had to teach.

810
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:34,116
Have you seen a picture of him, or talked to him on the telephone?

811
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,328
This is ridiculous.

812
01:10:36,412 --> 01:10:38,123
I phoned Princeton.

813
01:10:38,789 --> 01:10:42,249
According to their housing records, John lived alone.

814
01:10:44,962 --> 01:10:48,549
Now, which is more likely? That your husband,

815
01:10:48,633 --> 01:10:50,884
a mathematician with no military training,

816
01:10:50,968 --> 01:10:53,012
is a government spy fleeing the Russians...

817
01:10:53,096 --> 01:10:54,973
You're making him sound crazy.

818
01:10:55,057 --> 01:10:58,100
Or, that he has lost his grip on reality?

819
01:11:00,810 --> 01:11:04,146
Now, the only way I can help him is to show him the difference

820
01:11:04,229 --> 01:11:07,983
between what is real and what is in his mind.

821
01:11:12,155 --> 01:11:13,405
Come on.

822
01:11:15,491 --> 01:11:17,535
What's he been working on?

823
01:11:18,494 --> 01:11:20,413
His work is classified.

824
01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:25,331
He mentioned a supervisor by the name of William Parcher.

825
01:11:25,793 --> 01:11:28,295
Maybe Mr. Parcher can clarify things for us.

826
01:11:28,379 --> 01:11:31,216
But I can't get to him without clearances.

827
01:11:32,593 --> 01:11:35,886
You want me to help you get the details of my husband's work?

828
01:11:37,387 --> 01:11:41,181
John thinks I'm a Russian spy. Is that what you think?

829
01:11:46,229 --> 01:11:48,231
- What did the doctor say? - Is he sick?

830
01:11:48,983 --> 01:11:51,694
I don't know. I want to see what John's been working on.

831
01:11:51,819 --> 01:11:53,655
Alicia, you know, you can't go in his office.

832
01:11:53,739 --> 01:11:56,198
You know, it's classified, Alicia. Stop.

833
01:12:10,463 --> 01:12:11,881
Oh, my God.

834
01:12:16,343 --> 01:12:17,718
Oh, my God.

835
01:12:26,228 --> 01:12:28,521
Why didn't you say something?

836
01:12:28,604 --> 01:12:33,105
Alicia, I mean, John has always been a little weird.

837
01:12:33,693 --> 01:12:38,114
He said he was doing code-breaking. That it was eyes-only.

838
01:12:38,198 --> 01:12:41,619
- Top-secret, part of the military effort. - Was he?

839
01:12:41,702 --> 01:12:43,494
Well, it was possible, you know?

840
01:12:43,578 --> 01:12:45,079
I mean, directives come down all the time

841
01:12:45,162 --> 01:12:46,663
that some of us aren't cleared for.

842
01:12:46,747 --> 01:12:50,419
- It was possible. - Possible, but not likely.

843
01:12:53,172 --> 01:12:57,669
Lately, he'd become so much more agitated, and then when you called...

844
01:12:57,757 --> 01:13:01,261
So, is this all he's been doing every day?

845
01:13:01,345 --> 01:13:03,138
Cutting up magazines?

846
01:13:05,307 --> 01:13:07,058
Well, not all.

847
01:14:29,057 --> 01:14:31,517
- I'm so sorry. - it's okay.

848
01:14:35,395 --> 01:14:37,439
- I missed you. - I missed you.

849
01:14:40,193 --> 01:14:41,861
I have to talk to you.

850
01:14:42,195 --> 01:14:43,488
Okay.

851
01:14:48,783 --> 01:14:53,283
Alicia, I've been thinking about it, and I do realize that my behavior

852
01:14:54,665 --> 01:14:58,418
and my inability to discuss the situation with you

853
01:14:58,502 --> 01:15:02,713
must have appeared insane. I left you with no other choice.

854
01:15:03,382 --> 01:15:06,301
I do understand, and I'm truly sorry.

855
01:15:06,385 --> 01:15:08,345
That's okay.

856
01:15:09,596 --> 01:15:11,973
Everything is gonna be all right.

857
01:15:13,266 --> 01:15:15,476
Everything is gonna be all right.

858
01:15:16,268 --> 01:15:18,479
We just have to talk quietly.

859
01:15:19,564 --> 01:15:23,401
They may be listening. There may be microphones.

860
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:26,527
I'm gonna tell you everything now.

861
01:15:27,153 --> 01:15:30,448
It's breaking with protocol, but you need to know

862
01:15:31,324 --> 01:15:34,745
because you have to help me get out of here.

863
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:39,624
Alicia, I've been doing top-secret work for the government.

864
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:43,587
There's a threat that exists of catastrophic proportions.

865
01:15:45,131 --> 01:15:47,925
I think the Russians feel my profile is too high.

866
01:15:48,009 --> 01:15:49,885
That's why they simply just don't do away with me.

867
01:15:50,262 --> 01:15:53,181
They're keeping me here to try to stop me from doing my work.

868
01:15:53,514 --> 01:15:54,933
- You have to get to Wheeler. - Stop.

869
01:15:55,016 --> 01:15:56,268
- You have to find William Parcher. - Stop.

870
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:58,018
- He could help us. He could help us. - Stop. Stop.

871
01:15:58,102 --> 01:15:59,770
- He could help us... - Stop!

872
01:16:04,941 --> 01:16:06,316
I went to Wheeler.

873
01:16:06,985 --> 01:16:08,111
Good, good.

874
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:10,195
There is no William Parcher.

875
01:16:12,115 --> 01:16:13,533
Of course there is. I've been working for him.

876
01:16:13,616 --> 01:16:16,284
Doing what? Breaking codes?

877
01:16:17,203 --> 01:16:21,625
Dropping packages in a secret mailbox for the government to pick up?

878
01:16:23,001 --> 01:16:24,378
How could you know that?

879
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:26,295
Sol followed you.

880
01:16:27,923 --> 01:16:30,050
- He thought it was harmless. - Sol followed me?

881
01:16:39,643 --> 01:16:41,684
They've never been opened.

882
01:16:44,688 --> 01:16:46,188
It isn't real.

883
01:16:47,732 --> 01:16:50,318
There is no conspiracy, John.

884
01:16:53,155 --> 01:16:55,282
There is no William Parcher.

885
01:16:56,701 --> 01:16:58,369
It's in your mind.

886
01:17:00,997 --> 01:17:03,833
Do you understand, baby?

887
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:07,086
You're sick.

888
01:17:10,297 --> 01:17:11,881
You're sick, John.

889
01:17:12,467 --> 01:17:14,010
John?

890
01:17:14,427 --> 01:17:15,762
John?

891
01:17:24,727 --> 01:17:28,856
Code red. Dr. Rosen, code red. Observation Room 2.

892
01:17:28,941 --> 01:17:32,360
Dr. Rosen, code red. Observation Room 2.

893
01:17:43,539 --> 01:17:44,706
John?

894
01:17:47,543 --> 01:17:48,710
John?

895
01:17:51,295 --> 01:17:53,047
The implant is gone.

896
01:17:54,424 --> 01:17:56,050
I can't find it.

897
01:18:00,388 --> 01:18:01,720
It's gone.

898
01:18:33,336 --> 01:18:36,170
You see, the nightmare of schizophrenia

899
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:38,924
is not knowing what's true.

900
01:18:40,177 --> 01:18:43,013
Imagine if you had suddenly learned that

901
01:18:43,388 --> 01:18:47,849
the people and the places and the moments most important to you

902
01:18:47,934 --> 01:18:50,728
were not gone, not dead,

903
01:18:50,854 --> 01:18:54,274
but worse, had never been.

904
01:18:57,819 --> 01:19:00,155
What kind of hell would that be?

905
01:19:05,827 --> 01:19:07,453
Administering insulin.

906
01:19:08,539 --> 01:19:10,457
8:42 a.m.

907
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:10,348
How often?

908
01:20:12,434 --> 01:20:15,186
Five times a week for 10 weeks.

909
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:41,586
John always spoke so fondly of being here at Princeton.

910
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:44,298
And Hansen is running the department now.

911
01:20:44,382 --> 01:20:47,426
So he keeps reminding us, and reminding us.

912
01:20:48,219 --> 01:20:49,511
Yeah.

913
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:53,556
John won't come near the campus, though. I think he's ashamed.

914
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:57,061
Hey, hey.

915
01:20:58,187 --> 01:20:59,521
Want this?

916
01:21:00,733 --> 01:21:03,402
So, Alicia, how are you holding up?

917
01:21:05,111 --> 01:21:07,154
Well, delusions have passed.

918
01:21:07,697 --> 01:21:10,030
They're saying with the medication and low stress environment...

919
01:21:10,114 --> 01:21:11,365
No...

920
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:13,910
I mean, how are you?

921
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:23,712
I think often what I feel

922
01:21:24,463 --> 01:21:26,090
is obligation.

923
01:21:28,843 --> 01:21:31,470
Or guilt over wanting to leave.

924
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:37,517
Rage against John, against God, and...

925
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:41,063
But...

926
01:21:44,442 --> 01:21:46,442
Then I look at him,

927
01:21:47,525 --> 01:21:51,488
and I force myself to see the man that I married.

928
01:21:52,781 --> 01:21:54,784
And he becomes that man.

929
01:21:54,867 --> 01:21:58,912
He's transformed into someone that I love.

930
01:22:01,957 --> 01:22:05,586
And I'm transformed into someone who loves him.

931
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:10,757
It's not all the time,

932
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,471
but it's enough.

933
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:19,017
I think John is a very lucky man, Alicia.

934
01:22:24,436 --> 01:22:25,813
So unlucky.

935
01:22:29,817 --> 01:22:31,319
- This is us. - This is it?

936
01:22:31,403 --> 01:22:33,739
- It's nice. - it's near where I work.

937
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,699
John? You have a visitor.

938
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:41,329
Hi.

939
01:22:41,996 --> 01:22:43,164
Hi.

940
01:22:43,998 --> 01:22:45,375
I hope it's okay.

941
01:22:53,049 --> 01:22:54,341
Hey, chief.

942
01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:58,263
- Cigarette? - No, thanks.

943
01:22:58,346 --> 01:23:00,015
I quit, actually.

944
01:23:04,519 --> 01:23:06,061
- Hello. - Hey, John.

945
01:23:09,021 --> 01:23:10,565
Have you met Harvey?

946
01:23:13,569 --> 01:23:15,362
- John, there's no... - Relax, it's okay.

947
01:23:15,446 --> 01:23:17,907
There's no point in being nuts if you can't have a little fun.

948
01:23:18,073 --> 01:23:21,034
Jesus Christ, John. You know, I should have known.

949
01:23:23,078 --> 01:23:24,162
Here you go.

950
01:23:26,791 --> 01:23:28,500
I can take those later.

951
01:23:28,584 --> 01:23:30,169
You're supposed to take them now.

952
01:23:31,629 --> 01:23:32,881
Can I bring you something?

953
01:23:33,214 --> 01:23:34,632
I'm okay.

954
01:23:35,008 --> 01:23:36,092
Okay.

955
01:23:39,471 --> 01:23:43,764
So, yeah, I was in town giving a workshop.

956
01:23:43,931 --> 01:23:45,599
I go back tonight.

957
01:23:46,226 --> 01:23:50,063
You know, Bender, he really wanted to stop by

958
01:23:50,564 --> 01:23:52,856
and, you know, see you. You know, say hi.

959
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:54,191
Squeamish?

960
01:23:56,153 --> 01:23:57,444
Yeah.

961
01:23:57,528 --> 01:23:59,697
I suppose I would be, too.

962
01:23:59,781 --> 01:24:02,158
But, alas, I'm stuck with me.

963
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:08,247
I'm trying to solve the Riemann hypothesis.

964
01:24:10,292 --> 01:24:11,584
Yeah?

965
01:24:12,419 --> 01:24:15,380
I figured if I dazzle them,

966
01:24:15,465 --> 01:24:18,051
they will have to reinstate me.

967
01:24:19,342 --> 01:24:22,510
But it's difficult with the medication

968
01:24:22,594 --> 01:24:26,222
because it's hard to

969
01:24:28,434 --> 01:24:30,436
see the solution.

970
01:24:38,778 --> 01:24:41,280
You know, John, you should go easy.

971
01:24:41,739 --> 01:24:45,201
There are other things besides work.

972
01:24:48,538 --> 01:24:50,040
What are they?

973
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:28,284
What are you thinking about?

974
01:25:31,707 --> 01:25:33,290
What do people do?

975
01:25:33,499 --> 01:25:35,123
It's life, John.

976
01:25:35,833 --> 01:25:37,669
Activities available.

977
01:25:38,626 --> 01:25:40,337
Just add meaning.

978
01:25:47,928 --> 01:25:50,263
You could try leaving the house.

979
01:25:51,182 --> 01:25:54,893
You know, maybe talk to people.

980
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,319
You could try taking out the garbage.

981
01:26:24,964 --> 01:26:28,343
And there's some more... There's some more in...

982
01:26:40,063 --> 01:26:42,733
Who... Who were you talking to?

983
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:44,902
Garbage man.

984
01:26:54,035 --> 01:26:56,370
Garbage men don't come at night.

985
01:26:59,414 --> 01:27:01,542
I guess around here they do.

986
01:27:27,778 --> 01:27:29,109
Sorry.

987
01:28:35,886 --> 01:28:37,679
Is it the medication?

988
01:29:18,886 --> 01:29:20,889
I don't know what to do.

989
01:29:38,988 --> 01:29:41,824
My mother's going to keep the baby a little longer tonight.

990
01:29:43,117 --> 01:29:45,577
I can get three hours of overtime.

991
01:30:11,478 --> 01:30:13,103
I'm going to bed.

992
01:30:20,362 --> 01:30:22,365
- Good night. - Good night.

993
01:31:41,609 --> 01:31:43,695
It's good to see you, John.

994
01:31:44,861 --> 01:31:46,572
It's been a while.

995
01:31:47,698 --> 01:31:48,823
Parcher?

996
01:31:49,825 --> 01:31:51,076
Yes, sir.

997
01:31:54,704 --> 01:31:55,955
You're not real!

998
01:31:56,039 --> 01:31:58,708
Of course I am. Don't be ridiculous.

999
01:32:03,296 --> 01:32:05,755
I don't think that I would go that way, John.

1000
01:32:07,258 --> 01:32:09,552
It's time for you to get back to work.

1001
01:32:10,053 --> 01:32:13,723
The bomb is in its final position here in the U.S.

1002
01:32:15,725 --> 01:32:20,188
Knowing your situation requires you keep a low profile, Mohammed,

1003
01:32:21,314 --> 01:32:23,566
we've brought the mountain to you.

1004
01:32:42,752 --> 01:32:47,251
We've narrowed the bomb's location to somewhere on the Eastern Seaboard,

1005
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:52,218
but we haven't been able to pinpoint its exact position.

1006
01:32:54,055 --> 01:32:57,349
Their codes have grown increasingly complex.

1007
01:32:59,853 --> 01:33:01,603
Look at this, John.

1008
01:33:04,189 --> 01:33:07,025
What? What?

1009
01:33:10,279 --> 01:33:13,572
- Dr. Rosen said... - Rosen! That quack!

1010
01:33:13,656 --> 01:33:15,199
"Schizophrenic break from reality," right?

1011
01:33:15,283 --> 01:33:16,909
Psychological bullshit!

1012
01:33:18,118 --> 01:33:19,745
Look at me, John.

1013
01:33:20,662 --> 01:33:22,081
John, look at me.

1014
01:33:24,208 --> 01:33:25,877
Do I look like I'm imagined?

1015
01:33:28,505 --> 01:33:30,297
Wheeler has no record of you.

1016
01:33:30,465 --> 01:33:32,841
Do you think we list our personnel?

1017
01:33:35,219 --> 01:33:38,014
John, I'm sorry you had to go through all this.

1018
01:33:39,015 --> 01:33:41,643
I've gone to a great deal of trouble to get you back.

1019
01:33:42,061 --> 01:33:44,730
I can restore your status at Wheeler.

1020
01:33:44,813 --> 01:33:47,565
I can let the world know what you did.

1021
01:33:47,649 --> 01:33:49,773
But I need you now, soldier.

1022
01:33:56,157 --> 01:33:58,533
I was so scared you weren't real.

1023
01:34:06,541 --> 01:34:08,418
There's a storm coming.

1024
01:34:08,503 --> 01:34:11,214
I'm just going to grab the laundry. Okay?

1025
01:34:11,297 --> 01:34:13,008
I'll draw his bath.

1026
01:34:16,468 --> 01:34:17,803
It's okay.

1027
01:34:19,931 --> 01:34:21,014
Okay.

1028
01:35:59,652 --> 01:36:00,779
John!

1029
01:36:07,410 --> 01:36:10,539
I've almost got it! Charles, you just watch the baby.

1030
01:36:11,624 --> 01:36:12,665
No!

1031
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:15,127
Oh, God.

1032
01:36:24,301 --> 01:36:26,386
Charles was watching him. He was okay.

1033
01:36:26,470 --> 01:36:27,679
There is no one here.

1034
01:36:28,138 --> 01:36:29,180
Oh, my God!

1035
01:36:29,264 --> 01:36:30,932
- Charles was watching him. - There is no one here!

1036
01:36:31,016 --> 01:36:32,935
He's been injected with a cloaking serum.

1037
01:36:33,019 --> 01:36:36,729
I can see him because of a chemical that was released into my bloodstream

1038
01:36:36,813 --> 01:36:38,314
when my implant dissolved.

1039
01:36:40,693 --> 01:36:42,653
I couldn't tell you, it was for your own protection!

1040
01:36:44,906 --> 01:36:46,157
Alicia!

1041
01:36:51,246 --> 01:36:52,288
No!

1042
01:36:52,372 --> 01:36:54,415
Hello, I need Dr. Rosen's office, please.

1043
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:55,833
You've got to stop her, John.

1044
01:36:58,336 --> 01:37:00,003
You leave her out of it.

1045
01:37:01,964 --> 01:37:03,298
Who are you talking to?

1046
01:37:03,382 --> 01:37:05,216
- It's not her fault. - John.

1047
01:37:05,299 --> 01:37:07,592
- She'll compromise us again. - No, she won't.

1048
01:37:07,677 --> 01:37:08,761
You'll go back to the hospital.

1049
01:37:08,844 --> 01:37:10,095
John, answer me!

1050
01:37:10,179 --> 01:37:11,430
Countless people will die.

1051
01:37:11,514 --> 01:37:13,307
Alicia, please put the phone down.

1052
01:37:13,391 --> 01:37:14,476
I can't let that happen.

1053
01:37:14,559 --> 01:37:17,645
Yes, hello? Hi, I need Dr. Rosen. Is he in?

1054
01:37:19,189 --> 01:37:20,814
I'm sorry, John.

1055
01:37:22,234 --> 01:37:23,275
No!

1056
01:37:26,905 --> 01:37:27,906
Alicia.

1057
01:37:27,990 --> 01:37:30,200
- You know what you have to do, Nash. - Get away from me.

1058
01:37:30,284 --> 01:37:32,244
- She's too great a risk. - Get away!

1059
01:37:33,663 --> 01:37:35,204
I didn't mean to hurt you!

1060
01:37:37,541 --> 01:37:39,708
Finish her. She knows too much now.

1061
01:37:44,046 --> 01:37:45,547
Uncle John?

1062
01:37:45,631 --> 01:37:49,092
You take care of her, you pathetic piece of shit, or I'll take care of you.

1063
01:37:49,176 --> 01:37:53,263
John. Christ, John, please do what he says.

1064
01:37:53,346 --> 01:37:55,556
Move, soldier.

1065
01:37:56,018 --> 01:37:57,059
Now.

1066
01:37:57,393 --> 01:37:58,645
Uncle John?

1067
01:37:59,562 --> 01:38:01,105
John, please!

1068
01:38:02,523 --> 01:38:03,566
Now!

1069
01:38:04,401 --> 01:38:06,819
Alicia and Charles never coexist in the same interactive field.

1070
01:38:06,901 --> 01:38:09,321
Parcher and Charles...

1071
01:38:12,033 --> 01:38:15,202
Charles and Marcee cannot coexist with Alicia.

1072
01:38:17,661 --> 01:38:18,664
Charles is watching her!

1073
01:38:19,122 --> 01:38:20,372
With Alicia.

1074
01:38:20,456 --> 01:38:22,166
I understand.

1075
01:38:27,255 --> 01:38:28,297
No!

1076
01:38:38,933 --> 01:38:40,184
She never gets old.

1077
01:38:43,856 --> 01:38:46,650
Marcee can't be real. She never gets old.

1078
01:39:20,141 --> 01:39:21,307
You see them now?

1079
01:39:31,027 --> 01:39:32,112
Yes.

1080
01:39:34,571 --> 01:39:35,988
Why did you stop your meds?

1081
01:39:39,492 --> 01:39:40,659
Because I couldn't do my work.

1082
01:39:41,620 --> 01:39:44,331
I couldn't help with the baby. I couldn't...

1083
01:39:47,084 --> 01:39:48,375
I couldn't respond to my wife.

1084
01:39:52,214 --> 01:39:53,714
You think that's better than being crazy?

1085
01:39:54,508 --> 01:39:58,762
We'll need to start you on a higher run of insulin shocks and a new medication.

1086
01:39:58,846 --> 01:39:59,888
No.

1087
01:40:01,224 --> 01:40:02,767
There has to be another way.

1088
01:40:02,851 --> 01:40:04,476
Schizophrenia is degenerative.

1089
01:40:04,852 --> 01:40:08,857
Some days may be symptom-free, but over time, you are getting worse.

1090
01:40:08,939 --> 01:40:11,523
It's a problem. That's all it is.

1091
01:40:12,816 --> 01:40:16,403
It's a problem with no solution. And that's what I do, I solve problems.

1092
01:40:16,486 --> 01:40:18,279
- That's what I do best. - This isn't math.

1093
01:40:18,364 --> 01:40:19,530
You can't come up with a formula

1094
01:40:19,615 --> 01:40:21,450
to change the way you experience the world.

1095
01:40:21,534 --> 01:40:23,117
All I have to do is apply my mind.

1096
01:40:23,201 --> 01:40:24,911
There's no theorem, no proof.

1097
01:40:24,995 --> 01:40:27,414
- You can't reason your way out of this. - Why not? Why can't I?

1098
01:40:27,497 --> 01:40:30,667
Because your mind is where the problem is in the first place.

1099
01:40:32,795 --> 01:40:34,297
I can do this.

1100
01:40:35,549 --> 01:40:38,551
I can work it out. All I need is time.

1101
01:40:41,971 --> 01:40:43,597
Is that the baby?

1102
01:40:45,726 --> 01:40:47,727
The baby is at my mother's, John.

1103
01:41:02,073 --> 01:41:06,573
Without treatment, John, the fantasies may take over entirely.

1104
01:41:27,389 --> 01:41:28,681
You almost ready?

1105
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:33,145
Rosen's waiting outside.

1106
01:41:34,939 --> 01:41:36,649
I can't go back to that hospital.

1107
01:41:40,944 --> 01:41:42,155
I won't come home.

1108
01:41:46,408 --> 01:41:49,578
He said that if you said that,

1109
01:41:49,663 --> 01:41:51,998
he has commitment papers for me to sign.

1110
01:41:55,292 --> 01:41:57,169
Well, maybe you won't sign them.

1111
01:41:58,797 --> 01:42:00,506
Maybe you'll just give me some time.

1112
01:42:04,053 --> 01:42:05,801
I will try to figure this out.

1113
01:42:08,304 --> 01:42:12,641
Whatever you do, Rosen is right about one thing.

1114
01:42:14,310 --> 01:42:15,602
You shouldn't be here.

1115
01:42:18,523 --> 01:42:19,691
I'm not safe any more.

1116
01:42:26,071 --> 01:42:27,782
Would you have hurt me, John?

1117
01:42:37,543 --> 01:42:39,002
I don't know.

1118
01:42:40,169 --> 01:42:42,629
Maybe you should let Dr. Rosen drive you to your mother's.

1119
01:43:04,193 --> 01:43:05,527
He told me to leave.

1120
01:43:13,036 --> 01:43:14,369
I understand.

1121
01:43:50,114 --> 01:43:52,950
Rosen said to call if you try and kill me, or anything.

1122
01:44:10,590 --> 01:44:12,259
You want to know what's real?

1123
01:44:17,474 --> 01:44:18,599
This.

1124
01:44:27,024 --> 01:44:28,108
This.

1125
01:44:34,157 --> 01:44:35,283
This.

1126
01:44:37,701 --> 01:44:39,161
This is real.

1127
01:44:42,747 --> 01:44:46,959
Maybe the part that knows the waking from the dream,

1128
01:44:48,879 --> 01:44:50,254
maybe it isn't here.

1129
01:44:54,552 --> 01:44:55,928
Maybe it's here.

1130
01:45:02,351 --> 01:45:06,851
I need to believe that something extraordinary is possible.

1131
01:46:10,667 --> 01:46:11,751
Come.

1132
01:46:21,136 --> 01:46:22,138
Hello, Martin.

1133
01:46:27,851 --> 01:46:29,311
Jesus Christ.

1134
01:46:31,228 --> 01:46:32,480
No, I...

1135
01:46:34,105 --> 01:46:35,148
I don't have that one.

1136
01:46:35,233 --> 01:46:37,235
My savior complex takes on a completely different form.

1137
01:46:39,862 --> 01:46:44,283
I heard what happened and I wanted to write, and I tried you at MacArthur's,

1138
01:46:44,367 --> 01:46:45,910
but you'd left, and I just...

1139
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:00,758
This is Helinger's old office.

1140
01:47:01,510 --> 01:47:02,593
Yeah.

1141
01:47:03,011 --> 01:47:04,845
Yeah, I stole it from him.

1142
01:47:07,932 --> 01:47:10,141
Seems that you won after all, Martin.

1143
01:47:12,144 --> 01:47:14,102
They were wrong, John. No one wins.

1144
01:47:15,105 --> 01:47:16,855
Please, please, have a seat.

1145
01:47:18,357 --> 01:47:19,777
God, it's so good to see you.

1146
01:47:23,113 --> 01:47:24,823
What brings you back to Princeton?

1147
01:47:25,365 --> 01:47:29,452
John? John, I'm sorry, but you have to tell him.

1148
01:47:29,536 --> 01:47:31,830
Tell him you're a genius. You're a genius, John!

1149
01:47:31,913 --> 01:47:34,666
Tell him your work is critical. John, please!

1150
01:47:49,805 --> 01:47:52,557
Is there any chance that you could ignore what I just did?

1151
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,479
Of course. What are old friends for?

1152
01:47:58,898 --> 01:48:01,442
Is that what we are, Martin? Friends?

1153
01:48:01,525 --> 01:48:02,818
John, of course.

1154
01:48:04,111 --> 01:48:06,072
Of course. We always have been.

1155
01:48:11,578 --> 01:48:16,077
Alicia and I think that fitting in, being part of a community,

1156
01:48:20,420 --> 01:48:21,711
might do me some good.

1157
01:48:21,795 --> 01:48:25,050
That a certain level of attachment, familiar places, familiar people,

1158
01:48:26,966 --> 01:48:30,303
might help me elbow out

1159
01:48:34,934 --> 01:48:36,935
these certain delusions that I have.

1160
01:48:42,775 --> 01:48:44,777
It's a lot to ask, and now that I'm here,

1161
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:49,238
I'm quite certain that you will just say no.

1162
01:48:53,036 --> 01:48:55,245
But I was wondering if I could hang around.

1163
01:49:10,051 --> 01:49:11,510
Will you be needing an office?

1164
01:49:16,391 --> 01:49:17,432
No.

1165
01:49:20,894 --> 01:49:22,688
No, I could just work out of the library.

1166
01:49:23,815 --> 01:49:26,400
Well, this guy tries to wander into the library,

1167
01:49:26,484 --> 01:49:27,777
but he doesn't have ID.

1168
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:29,153
Why can't people read their memos?

1169
01:49:29,238 --> 01:49:30,780
Then, he goes totally nuts.

1170
01:49:31,197 --> 01:49:34,116
You're not real! You're not real.

1171
01:49:34,867 --> 01:49:36,327
There's no mission.

1172
01:49:36,412 --> 01:49:38,288
Shit. Shit.

1173
01:49:39,415 --> 01:49:41,832
You're not real! You are not real!

1174
01:49:41,915 --> 01:49:45,001
Is this what you are, soldier? Some useless ghoul?

1175
01:49:45,085 --> 01:49:46,920
The local madman?

1176
01:49:47,004 --> 01:49:49,631
- I'm not a soldier. - You're gonna end up in a cell!

1177
01:49:49,715 --> 01:49:51,842
Old, worthless, discarded.

1178
01:49:51,925 --> 01:49:53,051
There's no mission.

1179
01:49:53,135 --> 01:49:56,513
And while you rock and drool, the world will burn to ashes!

1180
01:49:56,596 --> 01:49:58,932
You are not real! You are not real!

1181
01:49:59,017 --> 01:50:01,143
You're still talking to me, soldier.

1182
01:50:01,226 --> 01:50:04,354
There's no mission! I'm not a soldier!

1183
01:50:04,438 --> 01:50:06,357
John! John!

1184
01:50:07,858 --> 01:50:11,487
Hey, hey, hey. John, John. It's okay.

1185
01:50:11,570 --> 01:50:13,239
I just heard what happened, I'm sorry. John.

1186
01:50:13,322 --> 01:50:15,073
- I'm not a soldier. - John. Hey, Nash.

1187
01:50:15,534 --> 01:50:17,826
Nash, hey, you're all right.

1188
01:50:20,870 --> 01:50:21,954
Nash.

1189
01:50:26,751 --> 01:50:29,296
Ladies and gentlemen, the great John Nash!

1190
01:50:29,379 --> 01:50:30,463
John?

1191
01:50:33,424 --> 01:50:37,846
You should've seen their faces. Everybody was just staring at me.

1192
01:50:38,346 --> 01:50:42,847
John, you know that stress triggers the delusions.

1193
01:50:43,852 --> 01:50:45,061
I know.

1194
01:50:48,314 --> 01:50:51,818
But then, on the way home, Charles was there.

1195
01:50:57,158 --> 01:50:59,198
Sometimes, I really miss talking to him.

1196
01:51:03,244 --> 01:51:04,495
Maybe Rosen's right.

1197
01:51:06,289 --> 01:51:09,000
Maybe I have to think about going back into the hospital again.

1198
01:51:09,668 --> 01:51:11,836
No. Come here.

1199
01:51:16,842 --> 01:51:18,634
Maybe try again tomorrow.

1200
01:51:43,701 --> 01:51:46,537
John, now you can't ignore me forever.

1201
01:51:52,377 --> 01:51:56,047
Charles, you've been a very good friend to me. The best.

1202
01:51:58,550 --> 01:52:00,010
But I won't talk to you again.

1203
01:52:04,222 --> 01:52:05,681
I just can't.

1204
01:52:12,064 --> 01:52:13,607
Same goes for you, baby girl.

1205
01:52:21,905 --> 01:52:23,156
Good-bye.

1206
01:52:30,915 --> 01:52:32,165
Good-bye.

1207
01:52:46,847 --> 01:52:48,765
I was wondering if I might audit your course.

1208
01:52:50,894 --> 01:52:53,352
It's an honor, Professor Nash.

1209
01:52:56,856 --> 01:52:58,107
Is something wrong?

1210
01:53:00,443 --> 01:53:01,653
This will be my first class.

1211
01:53:06,115 --> 01:53:09,576
Good morning, eager young minds.

1212
01:53:30,472 --> 01:53:32,141
It's never going to work, John.

1213
01:53:32,767 --> 01:53:35,226
You're just humiliating yourself.

1214
01:53:37,897 --> 01:53:41,524
It's pathetic! You are being pathetic.

1215
01:53:42,401 --> 01:53:43,860
I'm ashamed of you!

1216
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:12,888
Man!

1217
01:54:17,269 --> 01:54:19,812
Are you coming? You're going to be late.

1218
01:54:23,066 --> 01:54:24,858
- Dad, you've got my book. - What?

1219
01:54:25,694 --> 01:54:28,531
- You've got my book. - Right.

1220
01:54:28,906 --> 01:54:30,114
Thanks.

1221
01:54:31,659 --> 01:54:32,950
- Good-bye. - Bye.

1222
01:54:33,034 --> 01:54:34,202
See you tonight.

1223
01:54:35,536 --> 01:54:36,955
Bye, honey.

1224
01:56:09,836 --> 01:56:11,212
Did you just solve Riemann?

1225
01:56:11,296 --> 01:56:12,714
Well, what do you think?

1226
01:56:14,883 --> 01:56:17,844
That's an analogue to Frobenius for non-commutative extensions.

1227
01:56:20,223 --> 01:56:21,599
Yes, it is.

1228
01:56:22,516 --> 01:56:25,310
But it only appears to work sporadically, so, no.

1229
01:56:27,313 --> 01:56:29,273
But I believe I'm making progress.

1230
01:56:31,151 --> 01:56:35,320
You're John Nash, right?

1231
01:56:38,492 --> 01:56:40,406
- Toby Kelly. - Hello.

1232
01:56:40,490 --> 01:56:43,912
I've been studying your equilibrium, the one you wrote here at Princeton.

1233
01:56:43,995 --> 01:56:46,496
To come up with something totally original, the way you did.

1234
01:56:46,580 --> 01:56:47,956
You know, I was young.

1235
01:56:50,168 --> 01:56:52,627
I've been developing a theory.

1236
01:57:07,185 --> 01:57:11,606
I believe I can prove that Galois extensions are covering spaces.

1237
01:57:11,690 --> 01:57:13,733
That everything, everything is connected.

1238
01:57:13,817 --> 01:57:16,278
That it's all part of the same subject.

1239
01:57:17,697 --> 01:57:19,321
When was the last time you ate?

1240
01:57:19,988 --> 01:57:22,614
- Excuse me? - You know, food.

1241
01:57:24,534 --> 01:57:27,871
My wife, she loves mayonnaise.

1242
01:57:30,875 --> 01:57:32,209
Thank you.

1243
01:57:34,211 --> 01:57:35,379
Go on.

1244
01:57:36,213 --> 01:57:40,050
The function is in the two categories.

1245
01:57:44,722 --> 01:57:45,723
Alicia!

1246
01:57:47,476 --> 01:57:48,768
Alicia!

1247
01:57:48,852 --> 01:57:53,351
...and meet together at a maximum speed of, let us say, 10 miles per hour.

1248
01:57:54,398 --> 01:57:56,689
So you have a fly on the tire of bicycle

1249
01:57:57,442 --> 01:58:00,486
and the fly, who can travel at 20 miles an hour,

1250
01:58:00,570 --> 01:58:03,739
leaves the tire of bicycle "B" and flies to the tire of bicycle

1251
01:58:03,823 --> 01:58:07,285
and backwards and forwards, and so on and so forth, until the two bikes collide

1252
01:58:07,369 --> 01:58:09,661
and the poor little fly is squashed.

1253
01:58:09,746 --> 01:58:13,832
This is the important thing about actually focusing in and comprehending

1254
01:58:13,916 --> 01:58:16,794
the area that you're dealing with. Mathematics is very specific,

1255
01:58:16,879 --> 01:58:20,299
and it is an art form, no matter what these people around here will tell you,

1256
01:58:20,382 --> 01:58:23,467
especially the people from Biology. Don't listen to any of those people.

1257
01:58:23,968 --> 01:58:25,553
Let me go back to what you were doing before

1258
01:58:25,638 --> 01:58:28,265
because I think I might want to steal this and write a book and get famous.

1259
01:58:30,517 --> 01:58:32,144
I was thinking that I might teach.

1260
01:58:34,604 --> 01:58:37,440
A classroom with 50 students can be daunting for anyone.

1261
01:58:39,357 --> 01:58:42,152
John, besides, you're a terrible teacher.

1262
01:58:43,654 --> 01:58:45,030
I'm an acquired taste, Martin.

1263
01:58:46,616 --> 01:58:49,285
I was hoping there still might be something I could contribute.

1264
01:58:50,244 --> 01:58:51,412
What about the...

1265
01:58:52,330 --> 01:58:55,165
Well, you know. Are they gone?

1266
01:59:02,382 --> 01:59:04,175
No, they're not gone.

1267
01:59:05,176 --> 01:59:06,760
And maybe they never will be.

1268
01:59:06,844 --> 01:59:07,887
But I've gotten used to ignoring them,

1269
01:59:07,971 --> 01:59:10,849
and I think, as a result, they've given up on me.

1270
01:59:12,806 --> 01:59:17,102
You think that's what it's like with all our dreams and our nightmares, Martin?

1271
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:20,649
You've got to keep feeding them for them to stay alive?

1272
01:59:21,316 --> 01:59:23,359
John, they haunt you, though.

1273
01:59:25,194 --> 01:59:28,323
They're my past, Martin. Everybody is haunted by their past.

1274
01:59:32,451 --> 01:59:34,162
Well, good-bye.

1275
01:59:34,246 --> 01:59:35,747
John, I'll talk to the department.

1276
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:39,791
Maybe in the spring.

1277
01:59:46,216 --> 01:59:47,550
Hey, Nash.

1278
01:59:49,678 --> 01:59:53,347
You scared?

1279
01:59:56,391 --> 02:00:00,562
Terrified. Mortified. Petrified.

1280
02:00:00,646 --> 02:00:02,188
Stupefied by you.

1281
02:00:03,190 --> 02:00:05,775
Now you ought best ring Alicia, or you're gonna get me...

1282
02:00:05,860 --> 02:00:07,529
- I'll ring her. - ...in an awful lot of trouble.

1283
02:00:12,073 --> 02:00:13,784
- Than ks, Professor. - Good-bye.

1284
02:00:13,868 --> 02:00:15,704
- Have a nice day. - Good-bye.

1285
02:00:16,829 --> 02:00:18,540
- Papers in hand, Mr. Beyer. - Monday, sir.

1286
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:20,541
Professor Nash?

1287
02:00:23,962 --> 02:00:25,087
Can you see him?

1288
02:00:25,921 --> 02:00:27,548
- Yeah. - You sure?

1289
02:00:28,174 --> 02:00:31,550
Positive? He's within your vision? Good.

1290
02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:35,264
Forgive me, I'm just always suspicious of new people.

1291
02:00:35,347 --> 02:00:36,931
- See you next week, Professor. - See you next week.

1292
02:00:38,808 --> 02:00:42,561
So now that I know that you're real, who are you, and what can I do for you?

1293
02:00:44,064 --> 02:00:46,441
Professor, my name is Thomas King.

1294
02:00:46,524 --> 02:00:47,650
Thomas King?

1295
02:00:47,734 --> 02:00:51,822
And I'm here to tell you that you're being considered for the Nobel Prize.

1296
02:01:00,456 --> 02:01:02,374
Forgive me, but I'm just a little stunned.

1297
02:01:02,457 --> 02:01:04,126
Over the past few years,

1298
02:01:04,210 --> 02:01:07,628
your equilibrium has become a cornerstone of modern economics.

1299
02:01:08,128 --> 02:01:09,880
Suddenly, everybody likes that one.

1300
02:01:09,964 --> 02:01:14,463
What about my work on other some such projects, like manifold embedding?

1301
02:01:14,718 --> 02:01:18,430
The application of your bargaining problem

1302
02:01:18,515 --> 02:01:22,351
to FCC bandwidth auctions or to antitrust cases...

1303
02:01:22,434 --> 02:01:23,936
- Antitrust cases? - Yes.

1304
02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:26,063
I never would have considered that.

1305
02:01:26,147 --> 02:01:30,646
Have I just reached some level of honesty that borders on stupidity?

1306
02:01:31,276 --> 02:01:33,152
No, you haven't.

1307
02:01:33,238 --> 02:01:35,114
Because I wouldn't have thought of that.

1308
02:01:39,995 --> 02:01:41,286
Shall we have tea?

1309
02:01:44,124 --> 02:01:48,000
I don't go in there. I usually just take my sandwich in the library.

1310
02:01:49,293 --> 02:01:51,963
Come on, John. Let's have some tea. It's a big day.

1311
02:01:52,965 --> 02:01:56,467
Most commercially available brands of tea

1312
02:01:56,551 --> 02:01:58,636
are not suitable to my palate, you see.

1313
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,138
I'm not...

1314
02:02:00,222 --> 02:02:03,558
There are some Northern Indian teas which are dense enough.

1315
02:02:03,642 --> 02:02:05,603
I enjoy the flavor that they have.

1316
02:02:05,687 --> 02:02:08,648
I have not been in this room for quite some many years.

1317
02:02:08,731 --> 02:02:10,691
I wonder what tea they serve.

1318
02:02:12,985 --> 02:02:14,736
Why, thank you, young lady.

1319
02:02:16,571 --> 02:02:20,410
Things have certainly changed around here. I have a son that age.

1320
02:02:22,161 --> 02:02:23,411
Harvard.

1321
02:02:29,374 --> 02:02:33,875
I would have thought the nominations for the Nobel Prize would've been secret.

1322
02:02:35,256 --> 02:02:37,841
I would have thought you'd only find out if you won or lost.

1323
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:42,221
That is generally the case, yes, but these are special circumstances.

1324
02:02:44,347 --> 02:02:45,974
The awards are substantial.

1325
02:02:46,850 --> 02:02:49,854
They require private funding. As such,

1326
02:02:51,022 --> 02:02:53,190
the image of the Nobel is...

1327
02:02:55,651 --> 02:02:58,527
I see. So, you came here to find out if I was crazy?

1328
02:02:59,865 --> 02:03:03,782
Find out if I would screw everything up if I actually won?

1329
02:03:05,410 --> 02:03:08,621
Dance around the podium, strip naked and squawk like a chicken,

1330
02:03:08,705 --> 02:03:10,081
things of this nature?

1331
02:03:10,165 --> 02:03:11,959
Something like that, yes.

1332
02:03:13,626 --> 02:03:14,961
Would I embarrass you?

1333
02:03:19,549 --> 02:03:20,883
Yes, it is possible.

1334
02:03:24,347 --> 02:03:28,808
You see, I am crazy.

1335
02:03:31,312 --> 02:03:33,063
I take the newer medications,

1336
02:03:37,151 --> 02:03:39,317
but I still see things that are not here.

1337
02:03:42,238 --> 02:03:43,863
I just choose not to acknowledge them.

1338
02:03:46,741 --> 02:03:50,872
Like a diet of the mind, I choose not to indulge certain appetites.

1339
02:03:53,542 --> 02:03:55,502
Like my appetite for patterns.

1340
02:03:57,670 --> 02:04:00,923
Perhaps my appetite to imagine and to dream.

1341
02:04:02,341 --> 02:04:03,717
Professor Nash.

1342
02:04:08,932 --> 02:04:11,017
It's good to have you here, John.

1343
02:04:12,270 --> 02:04:13,603
Thank you.

1344
02:04:18,314 --> 02:04:19,939
It's an honor, sir.

1345
02:04:20,776 --> 02:04:21,901
Thank you very much.

1346
02:04:22,778 --> 02:04:24,070
A privilege, Professor.

1347
02:04:28,949 --> 02:04:30,285
Professor.

1348
02:04:35,541 --> 02:04:38,293
- Nicely done, John. - Thank you, Tom.

1349
02:04:40,170 --> 02:04:41,546
Thank you.

1350
02:04:42,715 --> 02:04:44,048
Thank you.

1351
02:04:52,642 --> 02:04:54,142
Thank you, Ed.

1352
02:05:02,649 --> 02:05:04,693
That was certainly most unexpected.

1353
02:05:26,842 --> 02:05:28,175
Thank you.

1354
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:34,347
I've always believed in numbers,

1355
02:05:36,015 --> 02:05:38,977
in the equations and logics that lead to reason.

1356
02:05:40,395 --> 02:05:44,894
But after a lifetime of such pursuits, I ask, what truly is logic?

1357
02:05:48,696 --> 02:05:50,113
Who decides reason?

1358
02:05:52,240 --> 02:05:56,741
My quest has taken me through the physical, the metaphysical,

1359
02:05:59,457 --> 02:06:03,544
the delusional and back.

1360
02:06:06,005 --> 02:06:08,716
And I have made the most important discovery of my career.

1361
02:06:11,550 --> 02:06:13,511
The most important discovery of my life.

1362
02:06:17,389 --> 02:06:19,683
It is only in the mysterious equations of love

1363
02:06:20,977 --> 02:06:23,313
that any logical reasons can be found.

1364
02:06:27,316 --> 02:06:29,651
I'm only here tonight because of you.

1365
02:06:31,696 --> 02:06:33,281
You are the reason I am.

1366
02:06:38,744 --> 02:06:40,245
You are all my reasons.

1367
02:06:45,253 --> 02:06:46,585
Thank you.

1368
02:07:41,097 --> 02:07:42,431
So nice to have met you.

1369
02:07:45,810 --> 02:07:47,394
I'll call for the car, Dad.

1370
02:07:47,479 --> 02:07:48,729
'Bye-bye. 'Bye-bye.

1371
02:07:51,190 --> 02:07:53,901
- Are you ready to go now? - Yes, I am.

1372
02:07:53,985 --> 02:07:55,736
Yes, indeed, and yes, please.

1373
02:07:56,489 --> 02:07:57,865
Thank you so much.

1374
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:00,533
Thank you.

1375
02:08:03,536 --> 02:08:05,496
What is it? What's wrong?

1376
02:08:09,875 --> 02:08:11,125
Nothing.

1377
02:08:12,461 --> 02:08:13,461
Nothing at all.

1378
02:08:16,257 --> 02:08:17,506
Come with me, young lady.

1379
02:08:19,383 --> 02:08:23,514
I have a car outside. Are you interested in a ride?

1380
02:08:24,640 --> 02:08:25,640
Where's it going to?
