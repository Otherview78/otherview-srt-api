Soobesükütsa tüa

2
00:00:34,333 --> 00:00:39,750
A long time ago, it is said,
a monster came here.

3
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,291
A white tail.

4
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,458
Sarii.

5
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,625
Go around.

6
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,166
I remember when
Father told me I was ready for kühtaamia.

7
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,750
My big hunt.

8
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,750
You were little.
So, Mother took you to gather medicine.

9
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,083
But Father and I,
we went up into the hills.

10
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,375
The rain was bad. Everything was wet.

11
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,000
We crawled through the mud
and my bowstring…

12
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,416
-…got ruined and--

13
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,708
-You were sleeping.

14
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,750
I was waiting for it to circle back.

15
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,333
Now you're gonna have to
cross the river to get it.

16
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,250
Whoa.

17
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,041
Don't get your bowstring wet.

18
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:40,958
Taabe,

19
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,500
this morning in the sky,

20
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,833
I saw a sign. The thunderbird.

21
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,000
I've been practicing.

22
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:52,833
It's time. I'm ready for my kühtaamia.

23
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,916
You really think you're ready?

24
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,791
You wanna hunt something
that's hunting you?

25
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,166
Search.

26
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,000
-Trained him well.
-It's easy. He's smart.

27
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:08,291
Not every smart creature is easy to train.

28
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,458
-Is that for War Chief's bad knee?
-Mmm.

29
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,375
He's getting worse.

30
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,000
You didn't put orange totsiyaa.

31
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,583
Who taught you about orange totsiyaa?

32
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,541
You.

33
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,291
Hmm.

34
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:42,166
Your father left you that
to cut breadroot with.

35
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,000
I almost got a deer with it.

36
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,708
Yeah. Well, we can't eat "almost."

37
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:55,083
My girl, you are good
at so many other things.

38
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,250
Why do you want to hunt?

39
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,875
Because you all think that I can't.

40
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,708
Ah!

41
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,416
In this wind, he brings home a red-tail.

42
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,833
You should have listened to my story.

43
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,833
Didn't think we had time for a nap.

44
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,041
Crazy.

45
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,041
It's sharp enough.

46
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,416
Go get us some orange totsiyaa.

47
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,250
Itsee.

48
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,208
-Hina?
-A lion. It took Puhi.

49
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,375
We gotta find him.

50
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,958
You could get shot sneaking up like that.

51
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,666
-Who's sneaking?

52
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,000
Who invited you?

53
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,458
We won't be gone long enough
to need a cook.

54
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,333
She should stay.

55
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,750
She tracks well.

56
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,583
And if we find Puhi alive,
she knows medicine.

57
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,500
You have to find that cat now.

58
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,250
-I will.
-I know.

59
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,291
'Cause you have to.

60
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,208
Oh, good. The dog found shit.

61
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,458
-We're not looking for wolves.
-It's not wolf.

62
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,083
You see that crushed bone?

63
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,291
That's lion scat.

64
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,291
And the cat that made it was big.

65
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,416
He's breathing.

66
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,416
Search.

67
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:08,041
So much could kill him.

68
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,916
It won't kill him.
Just cool his blood.

69
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,375
Anaa. Anaa.

70
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,958
Taabe wants to stay and hunt.

71
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,041
Let's go.

72
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,333
-I'm coming with you.
-I can handle the lion.

73
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,958
No, it's not just the lion.

74
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:39,916
Why is Puhi alive? There's something
that scared the cat away from its den.

75
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,583
I've got this.

76
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,291
Stay with Puhi. He needs your help too.

77
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:49,416
We don't have time to waste talking.
We need to get him home.

78
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,625
Hurry up.

79
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,041
I'm cold.

80
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,708
Don't move.

81
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:21,166
No.

82
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,416
The cold is good.

83
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,166
The medicine slows his blood.
If he gets warm, he'll bleed out.

84
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:27,666
Hey.

85
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,041
Do you want him
to be comfortable or alive?

86
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,125
Going.

87
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,500
We don't have time to wait for you.

88
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,958
-Look.
-Could be bear tracks.

89
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:44,875
Maybe.

90
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,291
But that's a big bear.

91
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,291
And why was it on its hind legs?
And what skins a snake like that?

92
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:51,958
-We need to keep moving.
-No.

93
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,458
I have to warn my brother.

94
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,375
Paaka, go with her.

95
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,291
Naru, we don't need the torches.
They'll scare the cat.

96
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,958
We're in its hunting grounds.

97
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,583
Why'd you come back?

98
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,791
I found tracks, and they were huge.

99
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,208
I'm not frightened by a bear.

100
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:15,125
I don't think it was a bear.

101
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,541
I don't know what it was.
I've never seen anything like it.

102
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,250
It skinned and gutted a snake.

103
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:24,625
Well, whatever it was,
we're in the cat's den now.

104
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,625
We have to deal with it first.

105
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:27,833
Come on.

106
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,750
The lion won't think
that we're hunting it here.

107
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,000
It'll think it's hunting us.

108
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:46,375
We get some bait,
then climb up and wait for it.

109
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:52,208
A hunter doesn't wait. He hunts.
We could be here all night.

110
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,416
We could stalk the forest all night
and not find anything too.

111
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,375
If you're too afraid to hunt,
go back to camp where you belong.

112
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,750
We'll try it Naru's way.

113
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:03,708
We'll bait it,
then I'll lead the cat to you.

114
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,125
Wait.

115
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,250
It's time, Naru.

116
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,625
Your kühtaamia.

117
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,541
When the lion comes, you tell that thing,

118
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:21,166
"This is as far as you go.

119
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,500
No more. This is it."

120
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,708
It won't matter how sharp it is
if you're too afraid to use it.

121
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,291
You think you're ready?

122
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,666
You've never faced a lion.

123
00:22:22,583 --> 00:22:25,666
Its mouth full of teeth like arrows,

124
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:31,333
ready to tear your flesh
and crush your bones.

125
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:40,458
When your brother comes back,
he and I will find the lion

126
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,791
-and kill it.

127
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:57,666
Your brother carried you home.

128
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,791
Wha-- What about the lion?

129
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,041
-Taabe went after it.
-Okay.

130
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:06,375
I have to find him.

131
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,833
No, you need to rest.

132
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,333
Here.

133
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,666
Drink this tea.

134
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:15,916
Here.

135
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:29,708
Puhi survived
because of your medicine.

136
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:35,500
There's something else out there.
Taabe needs my help.

137
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:42,791
If your brother needed you,
he wouldn't have brought you back here.

138
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:50,791
You think the reason for kühtaamia
is to prove you can hunt,

139
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:53,791
but there's only one reason.

140
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,333
To survive.

141
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,750
Taabe kima! Taabe kima!

142
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:03,041
-Naru.
-War Chief.

143
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,291
Naru.

144
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:05,583
Where are you going?

145
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,750
-We did it.

146
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:09,916
No.

147
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,041
We didn't do it.

148
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:16,208
What do you think left those tracks
and skinned that snake?

149
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:17,458
And before I fell,

150
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:19,333
-I saw lightning in the trees.
-Naru.

151
00:27:19,416 --> 00:27:22,291
-There's something else out there.
-And if there is, I'll get it.

152
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:23,583
We need to go back out.

153
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:26,208
-Far, beyond the ridgeline.
-No.

154
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:29,125
-Okay. Well, I'll hunt alone if I have to.
-You can't.

155
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,416
-Do I need your permission, War Chief?
-It's not about permission.

156
00:27:35,541 --> 00:27:37,500
You can't.

157
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:40,791
I had to carry you back.

158
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:46,916
I can hunt.

159
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,583
You're right.

160
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:51,208
We didn't do it.

161
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:54,166
I did.

162
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:59,750
You tried it. You just…

163
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:02,916
You couldn't bring it home.

164
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:20,166
If they don't see,

165
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:22,625
then show them.

166
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,958
Come.

167
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:17,166
Next time, you're cooking.

168
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:33,375
Come.

169
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:37,250
Come with me.

170
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:42,250
We have to go find
whatever left those tracks.

171
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,625
-Now.

172
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:41,791
Buffalo spirit, fly well.

173
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:45,916
Thanks creator, for your life.

174
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:56,291
Sarii?

175
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:24,541
There you are.

176
00:46:18,541 --> 00:46:21,500
-What are you doing here?
-Looking for you.

177
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:23,416
Your brother sent us to bring you home.

178
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,500
Where is he?

179
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:26,750
Searching for you
on the other side of the pass.

180
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:30,000
Where are you going?

181
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:34,916
-I saw it.
-Saw what?

182
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:36,875
I saw what left those tracks.

183
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:38,291
-The bear?
-There was a bear,

184
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:40,458
but there was something else,
and it was huge.

185
00:46:40,541 --> 00:46:43,250
I couldn't see it until it was
covered in blood, but it looked like--

186
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:47,166
-like a mupitsI.

187
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,416
You saw a monster from a children's story?

188
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,416
It fought and killed a bear
with its hands, easily.

189
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,333
How come it didn't kill you?

190
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:58,958
Stop!

191
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:00,708
You're going home.

192
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:02,958
-Enough!

193
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:31,666
That's bad.

194
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:43,375
You wanna leave? Then leave.

195
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:51,333
We're going home.

196
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,416
There's something out there.

197
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,375
Quit it!

198
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,208
Just sit.

199
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:14,708
You need a leash for your weapon?

200
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:24,166
Get some water.
We'll rest a minute. Stay together.

201
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,875
-What about Taabe?
-He'll meet us back at camp.

202
00:48:30,166 --> 00:48:31,750
I said stay together.

203
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,916
I gotta go take a squat.
You want me to do it here?

204
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:39,833
Water.

205
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:35,708
You should see your face.

206
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:39,125
What do you think
drove the possums our way?

207
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:27,416
Hey. Cut me loose.

208
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:29,250
Stay down.

209
00:53:05,333 --> 00:53:07,500
Shh.

210
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,625
-We have him.

211
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:12,416
No. He has us.

212
00:55:20,625 --> 00:55:23,833
-Look here.

213
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,166
Look.

214
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,500
A woman?

215
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:33,375
What is she doing here?

216
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:35,958
I'm going to take her.

217
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,500
She's going to delay us.

218
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:41,333
No. By the way she was running,
I think she saw something or escaping.

219
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:03,833
She's your new blonde, right?

220
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:51,625
Get that goddamned dog out of here!

221
00:56:53,583 --> 00:56:55,166
Sarii?

222
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,125
I don't have a good feeling about this.

223
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,375
You killed the buffalo.

224
00:57:22,208 --> 00:57:23,458
Ah…

225
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:47,791
Are you pissed off?
Now, you will pay.

226
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:49,541
Let's see what she knows.

227
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:53,041
- Talk to her Raphael.
- What are you doing here, huh?

228
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:55,666
- It's a trap?
- What is happening?

229
00:58:02,875 --> 00:58:04,541
What did you see?

230
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:07,875
I speak a lot of languages.

231
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:12,083
You are Comanche, yes?

232
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:17,125
- I'll kill her.
- Non, non, non, non, non, non, non. You won't.

233
00:58:17,208 --> 00:58:19,125
We can still use her.

234
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:20,750
Ah.

235
00:58:25,041 --> 00:58:26,958
You should be helping us.

236
00:58:28,333 --> 00:58:30,958
I think this creature is a hunter,

237
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:34,791
looking for the strongest beast.

238
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:37,541
What do you know?

239
00:58:40,458 --> 00:58:42,000
It killed your whole party.

240
00:58:42,083 --> 00:58:44,083
She's not trustworthy.

241
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
No.

242
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:48,500
It didn't kill everyone.

243
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:52,041
If you were smart, you'd help us.

244
00:58:52,125 --> 00:58:56,458
Take the savage out.
Get him out of the goddamn box!

245
00:58:59,583 --> 00:59:00,583
What?

246
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:06,208
In one way or another, you'll help us.

247
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:10,750
-Make him bleed.

248
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:28,500
Are you hurt?

249
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,750
Oh, they tried.

250
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,125
We shouldn't have brought the horses.

251
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:52,833
Shut them up or the beast won't show.

252
00:59:54,666 --> 00:59:56,750
Son of a bitch.

253
00:59:58,458 --> 01:00:01,875
The thing the white men
are trying to catch…

254
01:00:01,958 --> 01:00:04,208
-…that's what you went out after?

255
01:00:04,291 --> 01:00:06,458
-It's what you were tracking?

256
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:07,625
Yes.

257
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:10,916
And that's what you chose for kühtaamia?

258
01:00:16,458 --> 01:00:19,500
Where is the goddamn beast?

259
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:22,416
-I'm hungry and I need to piss.

260
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:31,916
-What's happening?

261
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,375
Oh, non, non, non.
What's happening?

262
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:37,416
- What is happening??
- What is happening? Rambert!

263
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,000
Shoot, Rambert !

264
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:47,958
Shit.

265
01:00:58,375 --> 01:01:01,208
I need to get me a horse.

266
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,583
It's here!

267
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:13,000
-It's coming.
-It's here!

268
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,750
This is some crazy shit.

269
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:20,000
Naru.

270
01:01:22,208 --> 01:01:24,041
Can you get your side loose?

271
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,041
Naru.

272
01:01:56,875 --> 01:01:59,166
We're the bait. He's coming for us.

273
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,500
No.

274
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:08,708
No. It doesn't want bait.
It doesn't hunt that way.

275
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:15,375
Before the trappers captured me,
it saw me.

276
01:02:15,458 --> 01:02:17,208
It came right up to me

277
01:02:18,083 --> 01:02:19,333
and then left.

278
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:24,250
It didn't think I was a threat.

279
01:02:30,916 --> 01:02:33,000
You wanna know how I killed that lion?

280
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:37,541
Your plan. The tree.

281
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:39,166
You weakened it.

282
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:41,666
You had it, Naru.

283
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,708
You can see what I miss.

284
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:50,166
You always have.

285
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:53,750
I don't know that this thing
can be killed.

286
01:02:57,208 --> 01:02:59,916
If it bleeds, we can kill it.

287
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:12,416
-Now!

288
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:21,750
Naru.

289
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:23,583
Naru!

290
01:03:50,708 --> 01:03:52,166
Bastard!

291
01:04:58,791 --> 01:05:00,291
What are you doing?

292
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,375
-I have a plan. Get down.

293
01:05:24,625 --> 01:05:26,916
Do you remember the flood
when we were young?

294
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,500
I saw a beaver that had its legs
pinned between two rocks.

295
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:34,625
The water was rising so fast,
it knew it was going to die.

296
01:05:36,958 --> 01:05:38,791
So it chewed off its own leg.

297
01:05:38,875 --> 01:05:40,625
Shoot !

298
01:05:40,708 --> 01:05:42,083
We'll hit the others!

299
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:44,875
Shoot!

300
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,541
It was worth it to the beaver…

301
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:05,125
Wait.

302
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:06,833
…losing its leg to be free.

303
01:06:06,916 --> 01:06:08,625
Wait. Naru.

304
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:11,375
What are you doing, Naru? Naru, stop!

305
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:18,125
I'm smarter than a beaver.

306
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:20,333
Come on, we gotta go.

307
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:35,875
-Where are you going?
-I gotta go get us those horses.

308
01:06:37,208 --> 01:06:38,416
I'll get Sarii.

309
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:24,083
Get Away. Move!

310
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:59,375
Let's hurry up.

311
01:07:59,458 --> 01:08:00,500
I need help.

312
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:04,041
We can't do anything for them.
We gotta keep moving.

313
01:08:04,125 --> 01:08:05,333
and the dog?

314
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,041
-I like the dog.

315
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:10,166
Knows more than the beaver.

316
01:09:21,583 --> 01:09:23,083
Sarii.

317
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:24,791
Find, Taabe.

318
01:09:25,291 --> 01:09:26,708
-Go!

319
01:10:22,291 --> 01:10:24,041
Help me! Help.

320
01:10:25,416 --> 01:10:26,583
You have medicine?

321
01:10:38,583 --> 01:10:41,875
Help me, and I'll show you how to use it.

322
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:43,458
Please.

323
01:10:46,416 --> 01:10:47,416
Please.

324
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:10,333
Take the powder
and put it in the gun.

325
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:13,583
Not too little, not too much.

326
01:11:18,666 --> 01:11:19,666
And then what?

327
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:23,125
Then you take the ball and the cloth.

328
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:26,000
Put it in the gun.

329
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:29,750
After that, take the stick you see there.

330
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:34,208
You put in the gun, uh, three, four times.

331
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:39,958
Last thing.

332
01:11:41,375 --> 01:11:42,541
It's okay.

333
01:11:47,166 --> 01:11:49,333
Put powder here.

334
01:11:49,416 --> 01:11:54,416
Then pull that back and it will fire.

335
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:56,833
That's all?

336
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:04,708
Please. It hurts.

337
01:12:06,791 --> 01:12:08,208
Please.

338
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:15,541
What is it?

339
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,541
What's happening? I'm freezing cold.

340
01:12:38,916 --> 01:12:40,916
Please.

341
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,250
Don't leave me.

342
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:04,791
It can't see him.

343
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,791
-Hey!

344
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:46,291
"Not too much, not too little."

345
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:04,625
Cheat!

346
01:16:18,625 --> 01:16:20,375
We should go.

347
01:16:22,125 --> 01:16:23,125
Taabe.

348
01:16:23,791 --> 01:16:25,666
Run, Naru.

349
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,583
It thinks I'm the threat.

350
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,583
This is as far as I go.

351
01:16:31,833 --> 01:16:34,583
No more. This is it.

352
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:37,458
-No.
-Bring it home.

353
01:20:40,916 --> 01:20:44,833
Non! Ah, non! No, stop!

354
01:20:44,916 --> 01:20:46,083
Whore!

355
01:21:04,416 --> 01:21:06,083
You bled my brother.

356
01:21:08,541 --> 01:21:10,125
So now you bleed.

357
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,625
Idiot Savage!

358
01:21:17,708 --> 01:21:20,166
You think that I am not a hunter like you.

359
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:28,958
You don't even know the mistake you've made.

360
01:21:29,791 --> 01:21:31,666
That I am not a threat.

361
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:35,291
I'm going to put a bullet in your head.

362
01:21:35,375 --> 01:21:37,458
That is what makes me dangerous.

363
01:21:38,458 --> 01:21:42,458
You're going to die, bitch!

364
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:46,333
You can't see that I'm killing you.

365
01:22:03,916 --> 01:22:05,875
And it won't either.

366
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:35,916
Demon!

367
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:39,083
No!

368
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,458
Search!

369
01:27:16,833 --> 01:27:19,500
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

370
01:27:19,583 --> 01:27:20,583
Do it.

371
01:27:21,916 --> 01:27:22,958
Come on, do it.

372
01:27:24,708 --> 01:27:26,541
This is as far as you go.

373
01:27:27,291 --> 01:27:28,375
No more.

374
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:31,625
This is it.

375
01:28:14,416 --> 01:28:15,958
Naru is coming!

376
01:28:19,375 --> 01:28:22,791
Arüka come! Arüka, Naru is coming.

377
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:24,291
Naru is here.

378
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:26,791
What does she have with her?

379
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:35,208
What does she have with her?

380
01:29:04,791 --> 01:29:07,083
There is danger nearby.

381
01:29:07,166 --> 01:29:09,166
We need to move
to easier protected ground.
