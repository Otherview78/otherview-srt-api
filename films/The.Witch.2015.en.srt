1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,035
Dd

2
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:11,693
What went we out
into this wilderness to find?

3
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,648
Leaving our country, kindred...

4
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,196
Our father's houses”?

5
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,081
We travailed a vast ocean...

6
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:30,045
For what? For what?

7
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,793
We must ask thee to be silent.

8
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:37,844
Was it not for the pure
and faithful dispensation of the gospels

9
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,014
- and the kingdom of god?
- No more!

10
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:44,013
We are your judges,
and not you ours.

11
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,971
I cannot be judged
by false christians,

12
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:51,601
for I have done nothing
save preach Christ through gospel.

13
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,606
Must you continue to dishonor

14
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:59,317
the laws of the commonwealth and the
church with your prideful conceit?

15
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:07,040
If my conscience sees it fit.

16
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:11,496
Then shall you be banished
from this plantation's liberties!

17
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,301
I would be glad on it.

18
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:25,017
Then take your leave
and trouble us no further.

19
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:32,024
How sadly hath the lord
testified against you.

20
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,026
Katherine.

21
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,286
Thomasin.

22
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,615
Come.

23
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:19,405
I will confess jehovah with all heart

24
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:25,828
in secret and in assembly of the just...

25
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,170
I here confess
I've lived in sin.

26
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:08,047
I've been idle of my work,
disobedient to my parents,

27
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,382
neglectful of my prayer.

28
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:17,640
I have, in secret,
played upon my sabbath.

29
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,352
And broken every one of thy
commandments in thought.

30
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,904
Followed the desires of mine own
will, and not the holy spirit.

31
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:34,699
I know I deserve more shame
and misery in this life...

32
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,668
And everlasting hellfire.

33
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:46,593
But I beg thee...
For the sake of thy son...

34
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:52,763
Forgive me, show me mercy,

35
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,560
show me thy light.

36
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,264
Thomasin.

37
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:27,960
Boo!

38
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:32,047
There you are, there you are.

39
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,220
Boo!

40
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,805
Where is Sam? Where is Sam?

41
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,767
Where is that little man?

42
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,897
Boo!

43
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,900
There you are, there you are.

44
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,987
Boo!

45
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,660
Sam.

46
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,582
Samuel!

47
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,661
Thomasin.

48
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,622
Thomasin.

49
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,682
Sleep.

50
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:53,392
All will be well, sleep.

51
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,252
Caleb.

52
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,127
God give you good morrow.

53
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,550
All are still a-bed.

54
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,049
Save mother.

55
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,051
Tis no ease to rise on a gray day.

56
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,849
The devil holds
fast your eyelids.

57
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,722
- I'll wake em.
- No, let em be.

58
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:19,941
Thy mother's not slept
a night since...

59
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:29,533
We can search no more, Caleb.
We cannot.

60
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,330
If not a wolf, then hunger
would have taken him yet.

61
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,627
I et's to the wood.

62
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,301
Been a'layin traps
for some while now,

63
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,553
even before this new misery.

64
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,180
Within the wood?

65
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,478
Will thou not help thy father?

66
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,806
You and mother have always
forbade us to set foot there.

67
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:01,937
Caleb, our harvest
cannot last the winter.

68
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,990
We must catch our food
if we cannot grow it.

69
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,786
We will conquer this wilderness.
It will not consume us.

70
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,328
Aren't thou then born a sinner?

71
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:42,287
Aye, I was conceived in sin
and born in iniquity.

72
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,632
Then what is thy birth sin?

73
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:51,429
Adam's sin imputed to me and a corrupt
nature dwelling within me.

74
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:55,555
Well remembered, Caleb, very well.

75
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,227
And canst thou tell me
what thy corrupt nature is?

76
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,397
My corrupt nature is empty of grace,

77
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:06,478
bent unto sin, only unto sin
and that continually.

78
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,358
Soft now.

79
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,835
We must lay it again.

80
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,734
Was, was Samuel born a sinner?

81
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,186
Aye.

82
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:49,646
Am I then...

83
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,232
We pray he hath entered
god's kingdom.

84
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,658
What wickedness hath he done?

85
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,781
Place faith in god, Caleb.

86
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,489
We'll speak no more on thy brother.

87
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,415
Why?

88
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,289
He hath disappeared,
not one week passed.

89
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,416
Yet you and mother
utter not his name.

90
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,498
He's gone, Caleb.

91
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,426
Tell Mel “tell thee what?

92
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,343
- Is he in hell?
- Caleb!

93
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,387
Mother will not stop her prayer.

94
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,592
And if I died, if I died this day...

95
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,927
- What is this?
- Iought evil in me heart.

96
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,708
- Me sins are not pardoned!
- Thou art youngly yet...

97
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,643
And if god will not
hear my prayers?!

98
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,850
- Caleb!
- Tell me!

99
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:32,272
Look you,
I love thee marvelous well,

100
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,776
but 'tis god alone, not man,

101
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,860
what knows who is the son
of Abraham and who is not,

102
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,113
who is good and who is evil.

103
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,792
Fain would I tell thee
Sam sleeps in Jesus,

104
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,540
that thou wilt, that I will.

105
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:50,544
But I cannot tell thee that.
None can.

106
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,555
Caleb?

107
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:59,928
Where are these from?

108
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,886
From Indian Tom and old slater,
when last they past through.

109
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,762
What did you trade?

110
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,732
Thy mother's silver cup.

111
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,767
Speak none of this to mother. None.

112
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:50,142
I'll tell her of the cup
when her grief has passed.

113
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,353
Let's not speak on this again.

114
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,108
Aye.

115
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,031
Fowler!

116
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,158
Fool of an animal.

117
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,910
Fowler!

118
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,373
Fowler, what's this?

119
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,880
Praise be to god.
Make haste, Caleb.

120
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,471
Fie upon't!

121
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:25,719
- Father, it died.
- The other end.

122
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,287
Father?

123
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,160
Father!

124
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,705
Fowler.

125
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,581
Black Phillip, black Phillip,
a crown grows on his head

126
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:51,668
black Phillip, black Phillip,
a crown grows on his head

127
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,414
black Phillip, black Phillip,
a crown grows on his head

128
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:58,000
black Phillip, black Phillip

129
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,344
jump to the fence post...

130
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:04,424
- Jonas! Mercy! Come hither!
- Black Phillip, black Phillip

131
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,759
king of all...

132
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,345
Jonas! Mercy!

133
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,474
Black Phillip, black Phillip,
king of sky and land

134
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:17,107
black Phillip, black Phillip,
king of sea and sand

135
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:20,782
we are ye servants,
we are ye men

136
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,736
black Phillip eats the lions
from the lions' den.

137
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,417
Black Phillip, black Phillip,
a crown grows on his head...

138
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,353
Get back! You two, stop that!

139
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,399
Phillip, back!

140
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,488
Heavens bless us!

141
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,117
Caleb, hold the gate.

142
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,740
Caleb!

143
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,042
Get in!

144
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,833
Oh.

145
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,637
I'll have thee quiet.

146
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,049
Wither were you
and Caleb this morn?

147
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,384
How could you disappear?

148
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,312
And thee, I told thee to keep
watch of Jonas and mercy.

149
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,981
I was, and I bade them help me
and they paid me no mind.

150
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,380
- I was a-getting...
- What's the matter with thee, thomasin?

151
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,395
What is the matter with thee?

152
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,322
Take thy father's rags to
the brook and wash them.

153
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,276
- They would pay me no mind.
- And brush out his woolens.

154
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,610
Help him!

155
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:56,912
Wee one, it gave me such
a fright to find thee gone.

156
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,871
I will not be left here alone.
Dost hear?

157
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,968
A morning's work
is well behindhand.

158
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,136
Jonas, leave thy sister be.

159
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,972
She likes it. “William.

160
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,468
What, can't a father spend
godly time with his son?

161
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:13,803
Jonas!

162
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,480
- Father said stop it.
- Thomasin!

163
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,148
- Stop.
- Stop it!

164
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,142
Each of ya, stop it.

165
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,815
Thomasin, take the twins inside.

166
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,612
No!

167
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:27,317
Get inside, get inside, get inside.

168
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:30,782
As you like.

169
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,702
We went to find apples!

170
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,167
In the valley.

171
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,003
I thought I seen an apple tree
in the valley.

172
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,082
Father brought the gun,
for if we glanced that wolf...

173
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,418
Why did you not tell me?

174
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,925
Father wanted it a surprise,
to cheer you, and...

175
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,932
But there were none.

176
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,850
I thought I seen em.

177
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:04,521
I like you not outside
the farm, even to the valley.

178
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,822
Dost hear me?

179
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:14,452
Caleb, be a good lad
and get some water for thy mother.

180
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:17,375
Stray not from the brook.

181
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,012
What then?

182
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,978
What?

183
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,609
Caleb? Caleb!

184
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:31,566
Stop it.

185
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,571
I meant no harm in it.

186
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,412
What's the matter with thee?

187
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,741
Come hither.

188
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,541
What's the matter with thee, eh?

189
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:51,218
Shh.

190
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:59,226
I've seen no apples
since we went from england.

191
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,429
I would thou hadst found them.

192
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,184
I so wish for one.

193
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,064
Hear that?

194
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,490
Aye.

195
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,944
Who's there?

196
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,030
I be the witch of the wood!

197
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,534
Mercy, come out.

198
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,332
I be not mercy,

199
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:26,420
I be the witch of the wood
and I have come to steal ye.

200
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:29,419
Hear me stick
a-flying through the trees:

201
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,217
Clickety-clackity,
clickety-clackity!

202
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,420
- Mercy!
- Clickety-clackity.

203
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:35,925
Why is't when thou dost a wrong,

204
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,098
I be a-washin father's clothes
like a slave,

205
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,847
- and thou art playing idle?
- Because mother hates you.

206
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,554
Spoilt child. I'll tell mother
you've left the farm alone.

207
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,810
Black Phillip saith
I can do what I like.

208
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,311
Devil take your black Phillip.

209
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,485
It's your fault I can't leave the yard.

210
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,859
I could go to the brook
before you let the witch take Sam.

211
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,032
- Quiet, thee.
- It were a wolf stole Sam.

212
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,361
A witch. I've seen her in her
riding cloak, about the wood.

213
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,159
- Father showed me the tracks.
- It was a witch.

214
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:06,995
Aye, it was a witch,
mercy, you speak aright.

215
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,670
- Thomasin!
- It was I.

216
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,088
Liar.

217
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:14,544
Twas I what stole him,
I be the witch of the wood.

218
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,675
- Liar! Liar!
- I am.

219
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,506
List not to her, mercy.

220
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,808
I am that very witch.

221
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,353
When I sleep, my spirit slips
away from my body

222
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:28,183
and dances naked with the devil.

223
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,859
- That's how I signed his book.
- No.

224
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,107
He bade me bring him an
unbaptized babe,

225
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:37,362
so I stole Sam
and I gave him to me master.

226
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:40,695
And I'll make any man
or thing else vanish I like.

227
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,495
- No.
- Aye.

228
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,665
And I'll vanish thee, too,
if thou displeaseth me.

229
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,494
- Be quiet!
- Mercy, she's but telling fantasies.

230
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:50,705
Perchance I boil and bake thee
since we're lack of food.

231
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,915
- No!
- Stop, thomasin!

232
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,841
- I'ts not true!
- It is, thou thing!

233
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,848
How I crave to sink my teeth
into thy pink flesh.

234
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,846
If ever thou tellst thy mother of this,

235
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,094
I'll witch thee and thy mother!
And Jonas too!

236
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,142
- Caleb!
- Stop thy tears and swear by silence.

237
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,390
I swear it.
You'll not tell mother nor father.

238
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:09,064
- I swear.
- Thomasin! Let her alone.

239
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:12,564
Get away from her, Caleb,
or she'll witch thee!

240
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,319
Why tell mercy
those horrible fantasies?

241
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:23,079
- Dost thou hate me now too?
- It was a wolf stole Sam.

242
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,413
Leave me be. Go tell mother
and father of my wickedness.

243
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:32,292
- Thomasin...
- I hate thy pity. I need it not.

244
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:40,341
And forgive us the sins we have
this day committed against thee,

245
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:40,428
and forgive us the sins we have
this day committed against thee,

246
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,952
and forgive us the sins we have
this day committed against thee,

247
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,727
free us from the shame and torment
which are due unto us, father.

248
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:50,306
We beseech thee, increase our faith
in the promise of the gospel,

249
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,234
our fear of thy name
and the hatred of all our sins,

250
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:57,779
that we may be assured that
the holy spirit dwells in us.

251
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:01,108
That we might be thy children
in thy love and mercy,

252
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,819
but as we hunger
for this food of our bodies

253
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:07,748
so our souls hunger
for the food of eternal life.

254
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:12,295
Finish soon our days of sin,
and bring us to eternal peace

255
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,963
through the purifying
blood of thy son,

256
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:19,259
our lord and only savior
Jesus Christ.

257
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,962
- Amen.
- Amen.

258
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:01,293
Thomasin, what's thou done
with the silver cup?

259
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,385
Is't not on the shelf?

260
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,306
Nay.

261
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,473
In the six board, then.

262
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:13,601
T'ain't there neither.

263
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,274
It's been disappeared
for some while.

264
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:18,606
Didst lose it?

265
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,692
I've not touched it.

266
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,817
Where has it gone then?

267
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,193
I haven't touched it.

268
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,267
I've caught thee
trifling with it before.

269
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,828
She says she haven't touched it,
Katherine.

270
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,375
How thou couldst lose my father's
silver wine cup in this hovel,

271
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,901
- I cannot know.
- I haven't touched it.

272
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,758
Peace, child. It's gone.

273
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,969
Did a wolf vanish that too?

274
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:51,222
She haven't touched it, Katherine.

275
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:01,232
What is amiss on this farm? Hmm?

276
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,606
It is not natural.

277
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:20,457
Caleb, will thou read out
a chapter of the word tonight?

278
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:26,170
We must find some light
in our darkness.

279
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:29,803
Tomorrow we will have a fast day
but for our sins.

280
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:43,396
Thomasin, dist not bed them down
before supper?

281
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,192
Baah, baah.

282
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:44,340
Oh, holy and blessed spirit,
be with me and dwell in me heart.

283
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,633
You must sleep tonight, Kate.

284
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,963
This night and evermore, amen.

285
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:13,072
Thou dost remember I love thee?

286
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:20,996
I do.

287
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,371
List me, Kate,

288
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:28,709
I fear thou dost look
too much upon this affliction.

289
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:36,050
We must turn our thoughts
towards god, not to ourselves.

290
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:44,605
He hath never taken a child from us.
Never a one, Kate.

291
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,483
Who might earn such grace?

292
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,740
We have been
grateful of god's love.

293
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,203
He hath cursed this family.

294
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,533
No.

295
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:09,421
He hath taken us
into a very low condition to humble us

296
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:14,050
and to show us more of his grace.

297
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:20,101
Was not Christ lead into the wilderness
to be ill met by the devil?

298
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,146
We should ne'er have left
the plantation.

299
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:24,564
Kate.

300
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,313
- We should never have left!
- That damned church.

301
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:31,738
- There's naught hither!
- Well, what need we? Silver chalices?

302
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,735
How dare you chide me on a cup?

303
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,072
Tis not for vanity
that I am grieved of it.

304
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:49,589
Katherine, I must tell thee...

305
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,167
We might have sold it. “What?

306
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:56,005
What fool would trade for our corn?

307
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:03,020
List me, our daughter hath begat
the sign of her womanhood.

308
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:08,817
Thomasin? Caleb?

309
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,236
Are you Abed?

310
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,279
Mercy?

311
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:15,524
Jonas?

312
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:22,532
She's old enough.
She must leave to serve another family.

313
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:25,618
Twas not her fault.
Kate, I must tell thee...

314
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:28,749
Aye, it was thine
for taking thy family hither.

315
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,171
This is godly land.

316
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,668
Godly?

317
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,640
Our children are being fostered up
like savages.

318
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,960
Kate!

319
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:38,172
How oft I begged and begged
thee to take Samuel for baptism?

320
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,757
They'd not baptize
outside the congregation.

321
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,717
Our Sam is in hell!

322
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,645
Go to.

323
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:49,524
God save us, Caleb is well.

324
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,522
We must keep him still.
And thomasin.

325
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:52,944
Our corn is trash!

326
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,067
We cannot back to that church.

327
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,568
We will starve!

328
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:01,074
Peace, peace.
You'll wake them, peace.

329
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:10,459
I'll to the village
with the horse and thomasin tomorrow.

330
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,006
The tildens or the whythings,

331
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,630
they can make use of her.

332
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,632
They're good folk.

333
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,965
Stop, Kate.

334
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,769
We will find food, I know it.

335
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,702
Caleb?

336
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:54,422
What are you doing?

337
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,090
Go to sleep.

338
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:00,420
What is this? Tell me, now.

339
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,175
- Running away then?
- No.

340
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,010
- Lie not to me.
- I don't.

341
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,687
Then what?

342
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,230
Tell Mel

343
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:15,106
if thou went back to sleep
and kept silent of this,

344
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,527
I promise thee,

345
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:21,234
you'll need not leave to serve
the tildens nor any family else.

346
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,740
I'll be back by mid-day.

347
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,615
- Well, let me along with ya.
- No.

348
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,326
- Let me along.
- I cannot.

349
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,208
If you don't let me along with ya,

350
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,130
I'll wake mother
and father this instant.

351
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,860
Well?

352
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,365
Aye, but we did!

353
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,067
Nay. “We did!

354
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,948
No.

355
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,449
We had glass windows in england.

356
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,952
We haven't been hither
so long you can forget that.

357
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:11,624
As you like, thomasin?

358
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,952
You've gone mad.

359
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:16,959
Dost not remember Fowler
laying on the floor in the sun?

360
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,792
- You must!
- Nay.

361
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:23,253
And where the sun would shine,
would he warm himself.

362
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:26,385
Remember once he lay upon the table,
and father saw him and he saith,

363
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,262
"we will have him for meat!

364
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,969
Kate! Kate!
We will roast this beast.”

365
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:33,646
You must remember that!

366
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:38,227
I remember that day,
but no glass.

367
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,688
Well... it was pretty.

368
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:47,994
What is't, boy?

369
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,617
Burt, calm thee!

370
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,419
Fowler! Nay, Fowler!

371
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,705
Stand here with Burt.

372
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,634
- Caleb, no.
- I'll straight back.

373
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,757
He's gone mad!

374
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,050
- Thomasin!
- Caleb!

375
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:11,141
- Thomasin!
- Caleb!

376
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,306
- Thomasin!
- Caleb!

377
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,103
- Thomasin!
- Thomasin!

378
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,063
- Caleb!
- Caleb!

379
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,563
- Caleb!
- Caleb!

380
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:23,568
- Thomasin!
- Caleb!

381
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,445
Thomasin!

382
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:30,370
- Thomasin!
- Caleb!

383
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,663
Thomasin!

384
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,176
Fowler!

385
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:56,146
O god, my lord, I now begin,
o help me and I'll leave my sin.

386
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,732
For I repentant now shall be,
from evil I will turn to thee.

387
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:03,357
None ever shall destroy my faith,
nor do I mind what Satan saith.

388
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:07,157
O god, my lord, I now begin,
o, help me and I'll leave my sin,

389
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,652
for I repentant now shall be,
from evil I will turn to thee.

390
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,328
None ever shall destroy my faith,

391
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,371
nor do I mind what Satan saith.

392
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,622
O god, my lord, I now begin,
o help me and [...

393
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,488
Caleb!

394
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,709
Caleb!

395
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:14,575
- Caleb!
- Father!

396
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,072
Thomasin.

397
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:20,494
Oh, my girl, my girl.

398
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,085
Where is thy brother?

399
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,279
What's the matter with thee, thomasin?
What's the matter with thee?

400
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,991
I'll set off at first light.
I'll not return until I've found him.

401
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,043
T'would be better to go to the village
to raise up help, I cannot...

402
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,496
Tis a day's ride and I have no horse.

403
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,127
There's no time to be lost.

404
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:36,004
Likely you should have left
this morn, then.

405
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,586
You have no gun, William,
nay, not even a dog.

406
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,672
- Be not a fool!
- I am a fool to go.

407
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,133
There is none will help this family.

408
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,891
I et me bel

409
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,432
the moon is bright,
the rain bothers me not.

410
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,402
I'll be back in a two-day,
if any a man will return with me.

411
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:57,231
- Don't go, father!
- Enough!

412
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,319
Tell us why you went to the wood.

413
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,780
- I promised.
- I care not!

414
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:11,585
Let me find favor in your eyes.

415
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,789
Oh, child, tell me and I will!

416
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:18,835
[, um...

417
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,598
Speak!

418
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,053
I took thy father's cup.

419
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:34,146
I sold it.

420
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:41,862
Forgive me, Kate.
Forgive me, thomasin.

421
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:47,830
What is this?

422
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:55,333
Katherine, I must make confession.

423
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,968
I yestermorn took Caleb
to the wood.

424
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:08,639
Twas for food,
and the pelts for money, good money.

425
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,720
I knew you were false!
I knew it!

426
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,306
I meant it as a surprise,
that is why I kept secret.

427
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:14,937
I will trap that wolf, Kate.

428
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,983
You stood by whilst our son lied to me!

429
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,902
Twas for thy sake!
I love thee, Kate.

430
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:21,572
- You took him to the woods!
- I will find him!

431
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,570
You've broken god's covenant.
You're a liar.

432
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,322
And you've lost another child.

433
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,904
- L1 will go now.
- You cannot escape the woods.

434
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,489
I will find him!

435
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:33,122
And kill thyself too?
Will Jonas be the man of the house?

436
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,203
Will you damn all your family to death!

437
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,710
- Katherine!
- Let go of me!

438
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,935
Picking apples.

439
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:05,032
Mother, have the goats
been bedded down yet?

440
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,360
Nay. I'll to it.

441
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:12,290
Let it Walt til the morrow.
They dare not escape with this rain.

442
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,241
Nay, I'll to it.

443
00:45:14,337 --> 00:45:17,204
Please you, mother.

444
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:19,209
Come hither, child.

445
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,974
Hurry back.

446
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:20,937
Caleb...

447
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,396
Father!

448
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,947
Caleb, Caleb...

449
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:56,803
Shh.

450
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:37,559
Oh, merciful father,

451
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,308
both the lord and giver of life.

452
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:44,187
Thy sole, Jesus Christ,
we beseech thee.

453
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,269
Look down from heaven upon him

454
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:49,276
with those eyes
of grace and compassion.

455
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,028
Pity thy wounded servant...

456
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:31,110
Baa, baa. Baa, baa, baa.

457
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,737
What ails Caleb, black Phillip”?
What ails him?

458
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:36,410
Did thomasin make 'im sick
in the wood?

459
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:37,737
What say you?

460
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,788
Black Phillip says you are wicked.

461
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,407
Aye, he told me too.

462
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:42,787
Damn your black Phillip.

463
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,254
He says you put the devil
in Caleb, that's why he's sick.

464
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:51,004
I'd never hurt Caleb,
nor Sam, nor thee.

465
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:52,926
- You beat me.
- T'was a jest.

466
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,628
- You said you'd eat of me.
- Mercy!

467
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,179
Mother and father will find out.

468
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,849
- What?
- That you are a witch!

469
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:03,471
Thomasin!

470
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:05,473
Thomasin?

471
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,846
Dost remember John kempe's son?

472
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,349
That first winter, he was
tormented of Indian magic.

473
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,230
"Tis not the same.

474
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:54,530
- This is unnatural Providence.
- I know not that.

475
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:56,824
Look at thy son.

476
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,242
Will. “What?

477
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,866
Think! Think what?

478
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,956
- Think!
- I have no thoughts.

479
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:06,204
Does this not look
like witchcraft?

480
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:07,831
What witch?

481
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,209
Who does this then? Who?

482
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,508
Thy thoughts are as a child.

483
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:22,721
What are you doing?

484
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,846
We'll back to the plantation
in the morning.

485
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:31,105
Find a good family for thomasin,
take Caleb to the doctor's.

486
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,194
He'll tell if this be
some natural ill or not.

487
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,158
Yet we cannot return as beggars.

488
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:43,705
I'll scour the field. There must be
some fruit yet untouched by this rot.

489
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:46,703
I beseech thee, Katherine,
what canst thou do for him presently?

490
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:49,786
How might we all bare it
to the village with no horse?

491
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,542
Well, the little corn and the goat
should fetch a fair price.

492
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:55,045
We'll... we'll back with Caleb
and sell them,

493
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,126
return with the horse
for the twins and thomasin.

494
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,633
- You cannot leave them here!
- Thomasin and thee..

495
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,338
Oh, forget the crop, will!

496
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,469
What?!

497
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:06,348
What dost thou want, Katherine?

498
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:09,938
Tell me and I will give it thee.

499
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,527
I want to be home.

500
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:19,858
Thou shall be home,
by candle-time tomorrow.

501
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:22,409
In england.

502
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:31,248
Oh, will...

503
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,080
I also have a confession to make.

504
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:38,585
I never meant to be a shrew to thee.

505
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:44,177
I have become as job's wife,
I know it.

506
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,518
But since Sam, since...

507
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,438
My heart has turned to stone.

508
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:08,034
I dreamed once,
t'was when I was of thomasin's years,

509
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,583
that I was with Christ upon earth.

510
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:16,630
Oh, I was so very near him.

511
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:21,427
And in many tears for the assurance
of the pardon of me sins.

512
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:25,631
And I was so ravaged
with his love towards me,

513
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:30,140
I thought it far exceeding
the affection of the kindest husband.

514
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:34,773
And since Samuel disappeared...

515
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:40,855
I have such a sad weakness
of faith, I cannot shake it.

516
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:44,487
I cannot see Christ's help as near.

517
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,741
I pray and I pray, but I cannot.

518
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:54,994
I fear I cannot ever feel
that same measure of love again.

519
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,885
Thou shall have of it in heaven.

520
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:10,601
I'll be in field.

521
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:13,521
If you can spare a while, do.

522
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,268
We'll leave at dawn.

523
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,099
I promise thee that.

524
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:23,780
Jonas, mercy, come hither!

525
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:23,863
Jonas, mercy, come hither!

526
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,323
Jonas, mercy, come hither!

527
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,364
Speak not a word!

528
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:41,374
Black Phillip is a merry, merry king

529
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,197
- he rules the land with mirth...
- Thomasin: I cannot abide your songs.

530
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,961
Please you, mercy.

531
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,637
Black Phillip has
a mighty, mighty sting

532
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,465
he'll knock thee to the earth

533
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,767
sing bah, bah,
king Phillip, the black

534
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:53,581
- sing bah, bah, bah, bah, bah
- Thomasin: Peace, thou thing!

535
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,345
Mercy. Thomasin.

536
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:57,352
Sing bah, bah, king Phillip, the black

537
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,483
- he'll knock thee on thy back!
- Thomasina: Enough!

538
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:05,155
Come.

539
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,953
Get the broadaxe
and cut off her head.

540
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,203
Get the narrow axe
and cut off her head.

541
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:17,751
Get the broadaxe
and cut off her head.

542
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:20,124
Get the narrow axe
and cut off her head.

543
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:24,546
She's upon me!

544
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,092
She kneels!

545
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,716
My bowels!

546
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,047
My stomach!

547
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:31,507
She pinches!

548
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:38,601
Sin! Sin! Sin!

549
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:41,149
Thomasin, take the children outside.

550
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:43,940
What does this to thee?
What does this?

551
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:48,983
His mouth has sealed up.

552
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,866
Oh, god, William!

553
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,118
William! Get him up!

554
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,620
Hold him!

555
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,871
Children, away from this!
Thomasin, help!

556
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:07,050
You'll break his jaws.

557
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,464
Father!

558
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,546
What is...?

559
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:26,608
William... he is witched!

560
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,404
- 'Tis she!
- No!

561
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,733
What horrible fancy is this?
She told me she stole Sam!

562
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:32,284
Silence!

563
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:33,723
She gave him to the devil
in the wood!

564
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,237
- They lie!
- What say you?

565
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,947
She turned flora's milk to blood!

566
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,623
She had bade us
keep secret from you!

567
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,747
- It was but a jest to quiet her, I...
- She made bargain with Satan!

568
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,420
She signed his book! Silence!

569
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,919
Don't let her near me!
She'll put a curse on me!

570
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,500
- They conspire against me.
- Thomasin is a witch!

571
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:52,758
Nay, I'll not hear it.

572
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:55,637
I'll have proof, or heaven help thee.

573
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,934
On thy knees!

574
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,433
Look me in the eye, daughter.

575
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:03,812
Dost thou love the word of god?
Yes.

576
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,018
Love you the Bible?
Love you prayer?

577
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,819
Yes. Yes!

578
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:13,867
We are children of sin all,

579
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:17,867
yet I tell thee, I have raised up
no witch in this house.

580
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:24,370
Let us pray,
then we need fear nothing.

581
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:27,376
We shall never lie open
to the wicked one.

582
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:30,835
Pray for thy brother.

583
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:34,075
- You must believe us!
- Evil wretches!

584
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,384
Thomasin!

585
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,466
Pray.

586
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:43,101
Our father, which art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name...

587
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,772
Jonas, pray.

588
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:48,728
I... I cannot remember my prayer.

589
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,734
What? Nor I. I cannot.

590
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,440
What nonsense is this?

591
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,651
Speak, children.

592
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:58,453
Our father, which
art in heaven...

593
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,371
Hallowed be thy name

594
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,371
stop it! Stop it!

595
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:05,578
Pray, you beasts.

596
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,253
Get on thy knees and pray!

597
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:10,424
Thomasin!

598
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,968
I don't hear this. This is not so.

599
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,802
It's her!

600
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,770
A cat.

601
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,438
A crow.

602
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:30,485
A raven. A three-legged dog. A wolf!

603
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:33,154
She desires of my blood.

604
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,777
She desires of my blood.

605
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,075
- Satan upon me!
- She desires of my blood!

606
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:43,791
She sends 'em upon me.

607
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:47,495
My lord, my Jesus! Save me!

608
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,672
- Think on Christ!
- She sends her devils!

609
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:55,128
I am thine enemy, wallowing
in the blood of my sins!

610
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:57,304
The lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want

611
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:59,507
he maketh me to lie
in green pastures,

612
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:00,995
and leadeth me by the still water...

613
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,555
I am thine enemy...

614
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,139
I am thine enemy,

615
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:09,350
wallowing on the blood
and filth of my sin!

616
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,444
- I will fear no evil
- For thou art with me.

617
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,816
Caleb... Caleb...

618
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:26,033
Cast a light of countenance
upon me.

619
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:29,495
Spread over me
the lap of thy love.

620
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:32,706
Wash me in the everflowing
fountains of thy blood.

621
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:37,340
Holy thine I am,
my sweet lord Jesus.

622
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:43,552
My lord, my love, kiss me
with the kisses of thy mouth.

623
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,390
How lovely art thou.

624
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,605
Thy embrace!

625
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:51,975
My lord!

626
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,561
My lord! My love!

627
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,988
My sole salvation!

628
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,906
Take me to thy lap!

629
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,262
Caleb...

630
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,099
Caleb?

631
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:36,273
Caleb?

632
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:38,363
Caleb.

633
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,940
Caleb.

634
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:42,617
Caleb...

635
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:46,201
Wake up, please! Wake up!

636
00:59:47,876 --> 00:59:50,834
Wake up, wake up.

637
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,664
Wake up.

638
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,753
He is dead!

639
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:06,182
He is dead!

640
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,604
Jonas, mercy, get up.

641
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,600
Get up!

642
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:23,029
Get away from him!
Get thee gone!

643
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:39,375
Thomasin!

644
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,175
Thomasin. Thomasin...

645
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:42,503
My girl...

646
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,937
This tree will be
lovely come spring.

647
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,363
Do you remember
when we came hither?

648
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,659
Such a pretty tree.

649
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,115
Next year I'll just own us
a wheat field.

650
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,919
Start it at this tree
and end it thither.

651
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:18,418
We'd have been a proper farm then.

652
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:24,427
Brought us a big fat milk cow,
finished us the barn.

653
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:30,305
You must tell me, thomasin.

654
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,729
Tomorrow I cannot keep secret of this.

655
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:37,398
The council will be called
and thy life is...

656
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:39,851
- Thy life...
- Will you not believe me?

657
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,858
I saw the serpent in my son.
You stopped their prayer, thom...

658
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:46,692
- They lie!
- I saw it.

659
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:49,823
Caleb disappeared with thee.

660
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:53,407
- I love Caleb.
- And who then found him,

661
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:55,082
pale as death,

662
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:58,287
naked as sin and witch'd?

663
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,622
Thomasin, listen to me.

664
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,878
The bargain that was made
is of no effect.

665
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:05,130
- I made no bargain.
- Thy soul belongeth to Christ.

666
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,884
- I made no bargain.
- The devil hath no interest in thee.

667
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:11,512
- I am no witch, father.
- What did I but see in my house?

668
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,886
- Will you not hear me?
- Prithee, confess.

669
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,846
Why have you turned against me?

670
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:20,150
Christ can un-witch us
if you will but speak truth to me.

671
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:23,855
As I love thee, speak truth.

672
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:27,817
- You ask me to speak truth?
- I beg thee.

673
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:37,034
You and mother planned
to rid the farm of me.

674
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:41,417
Aye, I heard you speak of it.

675
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:43,499
Is that truth?

676
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:48,841
You took of mother's cup
and let her rail at me.

677
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:51,298
You confessed not
till it was too late.

678
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:53,384
- Is that truth?
- Peace thee.

679
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:54,763
- I will not.
- I am thy father.

680
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:57,971
- You are a hypocrite!
- Hold thy tongue, daughter mine.

681
01:02:58,066 --> 01:03:00,853
You took Caleb to the wood and let me
take the blame of that too.

682
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:02,684
Is that truth?

683
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:08,023
You let mother be as thy master.

684
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:10,825
You cannot bring the crops to yield!
You cannot hunt!

685
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,618
- Is that truth enough?
- Enough.

686
01:03:12,706 --> 01:03:14,742
Thou canst do nothing
save cut wood!

687
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:16,073
Bitch!

688
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,453
And you will not hear me!

689
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:23,292
Must I hear the devil
wag his tongue in thy mouth?

690
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:27,133
Ask the twins then!

691
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,006
Go on, ask them!

692
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:31,509
They spend all day long
babbling to that horned beast.

693
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:32,839
They know well his voice.

694
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,219
Go to.

695
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:37,678
The adversary oft comes
in the shape of a he-goat.

696
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,647
And whispers. Aye, whispers!

697
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:45,481
He is Lucifer. You know it.

698
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:47,779
- The twins know it too.
- Slander thy brethren no more.

699
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:51,984
- It is they!
- From my sight!

700
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:54,140
T'was they and that goat
what bewitched this whole farm.

701
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:55,404
Lies.

702
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:59,245
Was't a wolf stole Sam?

703
01:03:59,336 --> 01:04:02,043
I never saw no wolf.

704
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,916
Mercy told me herself
by the stream,

705
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:06,464
"I be the witch of the wood."

706
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,212
Get up. Rise!

707
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:41,074
- What is this?
- Speak.

708
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:43,000
I am no witch.

709
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:45,107
Get her from me sight!
I'll not have her in this house!

710
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,871
She is no witch, Katherine.

711
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:49,582
What is the cause, daughter?
Tell thy mother!

712
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:51,042
I cannot know for certain.

713
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,843
Thou toldst me well thou knew.

714
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:54,387
I cannot look at her.

715
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:58,092
Aye, but ye shall.
Thomasin. Thomasin!

716
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:00,969
Jonas and mercy.

717
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,931
They make covenant with the devil
in the shape of black Phillip.

718
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:08,398
Dost hear that, ye black minions?

719
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:12,106
Dost hear that, you devils?

720
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:15,776
Wake! Wake from this!

721
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,825
Did ye makes some
unholy bond with that goat?

722
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,783
Speak, if this be pretense.

723
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:37,548
Dissemblers!
Grave pretenders all.

724
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,473
Hear me this:

725
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:42,553
I will not play a fool
to children's games!

726
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:44,729
This is no sport, William.

727
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:48,149
Yet these lies from our babes' mouths
are but trifles to them.

728
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:51,148
- I do not lie.
- Silence, creature!

729
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:55,198
Thy son is dead, damned!

730
01:05:55,285 --> 01:05:57,196
- Caleb did but cry Jesus.
- The devil!

731
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:58,527
Thou know it not.

732
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,237
- The devil will speak scripture too!
- Thou know it not.

733
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:03,163
Tis not true! We are damned!

734
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:04,661
Wake!

735
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:07,957
Fetch the billhook, wife,

736
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:11,084
and I will smite Jonas as Abraham
would have done his seed.

737
01:06:11,176 --> 01:06:12,416
No, stop it! Stop it!

738
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:15,502
Fetch the billhook
and I will dash his skull!

739
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,964
- No!
- Do you see?

740
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:21,674
- Stop it...
- Do you see now?

741
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:27,515
Please, father.
No, it's not safe. Not with them!

742
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,308
Keep me from this goat.

743
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:34,317
If that old Billy be the devil,
I'd have danced with him myself.

744
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:42,829
I'll break thee out upon the dawn
and we'll set back to the plantation.

745
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,827
Think on thy sins.

746
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,851
Are you witches?

747
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:09,355
Does father think I am?

748
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:10,807
Are you?

749
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,398
No.

750
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,320
Does he really speak to thee?

751
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:50,539
It is my fault.

752
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:59,249
I confess it.

753
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:03,002
I confess it.

754
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:11,018
Oh, my god.

755
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:14,351
My own fault.

756
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:19,731
I am infected with the filth of pride.

757
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:23,739
I know it.

758
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,441
I am.

759
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:30,781
Dispose of me how thou will't...

760
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:35,372
Yet redeem my children.

761
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:40,965
They cannot tame their natural evils.

762
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:51,017
I lie before thee a coward...

763
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,771
And thine enemy.

764
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:59,692
And I lick the dust of thine earth.

765
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:10,111
I beg thee.

766
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,290
Save my children.

767
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:19,621
I beg thee, my Christ,

768
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:23,425
I have not damned my family.

769
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:44,505
Me lambs... me angels!

770
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:02,565
Mother, we have longed to see you so.

771
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:05,226
As I to thee.

772
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:12,613
I must wake thy father!
He will be so glad.

773
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:16,912
No, let him sleep.

774
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:43,014
We would see you oft, mother.

775
01:12:43,109 --> 01:12:45,976
- Would that please you?
- Aye.

776
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:50,442
I have brought
a book for you, mother.

777
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:53,991
- Will you look at it with me?
- Aye.

778
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:57,320
Oh, one moment now.
Samuel's hungry.

779
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:01,616
Oh, come, come, little Sam.

780
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,501
Come, come.

781
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:19,133
Flora? Flora”?

782
01:16:07,021 --> 01:16:08,511
Corruption.

783
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:10,142
Thou art my father.

784
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:17,170
What hast thou done?!

785
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:20,625
- Where are they?
- I know not what I saw.

786
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:22,710
- Where are they?!
- I did nothing!

787
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:26,343
She came from the sky! She...
Devil!

788
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:29,425
You have their blood upon thy hands!

789
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:35,268
It is you!

790
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:38,351
- It is you!
- I am your daughter!

791
01:17:38,445 --> 01:17:42,063
The devil is in thee
and have had thee.

792
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:45,992
You're smeared of his sin.
You reek of evil!

793
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:48,694
- You've made a covenant with death!
- Mother!

794
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:52,657
You bewitched thy brother,
proud slut!

795
01:17:52,751 --> 01:17:55,959
Did you not think I saw
thy sluttish looks to him,

796
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:58,503
bewitching his eye as any whore?

797
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,832
- What say you to me?
- And thy father next!

798
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:04,009
No.

799
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:07,596
You took them from me!

800
01:18:09,393 --> 01:18:12,305
- You killed my children!
- No!

801
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:15,354
You killed thy father!
You witch!

802
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:17,523
I love you! I love you!

803
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:11,685
Black Phillip,
I conjure thee to speak to me.

804
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:19,279
Speak as thou doth speak
to Jonas and mercy.

805
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:29,618
Dost thou understand
my english tongue?

806
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:35,628
Answer me.

807
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:52,312
What dost thou want?

808
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:57,146
What canst thou give?

809
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:03,695
Wouldst thou like
the taste of butter?

810
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:06,867
A pretty dress?

811
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:12,082
Wouldst thou like
to live deliciously?

812
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:14,955
Yes.

813
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:21,257
Wouldst thou like to see the world?

814
01:24:22,516 --> 01:24:24,302
What will you from me?

815
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:31,184
Dost thou see a book before thee?

816
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:43,947
Remove thy shift.

817
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:08,971
I cannot write my name.

818
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:14,022
I will guide thy hand.

819
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:05,610
Dd
